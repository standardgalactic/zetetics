This paper presents the basic concepts of Role and Reference Grammar [RRG],
a theory of grammar which draws heavily on the analysis of non-lndo-European
languages and which is concerned with the interaction of syntax, semantics
and pragmatics 
in grammatical 
systems. RRG is a monostratal theory which
posits a single syntactic representation for a sentence, which is linked directly
to a semantic representation by means of a linking algorithm. 
The syntactic
representation of clause structure in RRG is called the layered structure of the
clause. It postulates that clauses are universally composed of a nucleus (which
contains the predicating element), a core (which contains the nucleus and the
arguments of the predicating 
element), and a periphery 
(which contains the
temporal and locative modifiers of the core). Modifying each of the layers of
the clause are what are called operators in RRG: they include grammatical
categories 
like tense, aspect, modality, 
negation and illocutionary 
force.
Complex sentences are composed of these units: nucleus + nucleus constitutes
a nuclear juncture, core + core constitutes a core juncture, and clause + clause
constitutes a clausal juncture. The units in a juncture may stand in one of three
relationships to each other: coordination, subordination and cosubordination.
There are thus nine abstract juncture-nexus 
types in universal grammar, and
the juncture-nexus 
types occurring in a particular language may be realized by
one or more formal construction types.
The semantic representation of a sentence is built on an Aktionsart-based system
of lexical decomposition; 
it is termed a logical structure [LS]. The semantic
functions of arguments are defined in terms of LS-positions. Crucial to the theory
is the notion of semantic macrorole; there are two, actor and undergoer. The
macroroles and other arguments are linked to the syntax by the linking algorithm.
RRG does not assume traditional grammatical 
relations; it recognizes only a
single grammatical 
function, termed the privileged syntactic argument.

In addition 
to the syntactic and semantic representations, 
there is also a
representation of the focus structure of the sentence. It indicates the scope of
the assertion in an utterance in contrast to the pragmatic presupposition. 
It is
an important part of the RRG analysis of many grammatical phenomena, and
one of the theory's major typological claims is that significant differences amonggrammatical 
systems reflect the different roles that focus structure can play in
the grammar, particularly 
in the linking algorithm.
The RRG view of language acquisition holds that children construct a grammar
on the basis of their general cognitive endowment plus the data in the speech
to which they are exposed; no autonombus language acquisition device is
required.
Key words: syntactic theory, linking, lexical decomposition, 
macrorole,
focus structure, language acquisition, clause linkage
1. Introduction
Role and Reference Grammar [RRG] (Van Valin 1993b, Van Valin & LaPolla 1997,
Yang 1998) grew out of an attempt to answer two basic questions: (i) what would
linguistic theory look like if it were based on the analysis of Lakhota, Tagalog and
Dyirbal, rather than on the analysis of English?, and (ii) how can the interaction of
syntax, semantics and pragmatics in different grammatical systems best be captured
and explained? RRG takes language to be a system of communicative 
social action,
and accordingly, 
analyzing the communicative 
functions of grammatical structures
plays a vital role in grammatical description and theory from this perspective. Language
is a system, and grammar is a system in the traditional 
structuralist sense; what
distinguishes the RRG conception of language is the conviction that grammatical
structure can only be understood and explained with reference to its semantic and
communicative 
functions. In terms of the abstract paradigmatic and syntagmatic
relations that define a structural system, RRG is concerned not only with relations of
cooccurrence and combination 
in strictly formal terms but also with semantic and
pragmatic cooccurrence and combinatory relations. It is a monostratal theory, positing
only one level of syntactic representation, the actual form of the sentence (cf. fn. 3).
With respect to cognitive issues, RRG adopts the criterion of psychological adequacy
formulated in Dik (1991), which states that a theory should be "compatible with the
results of psycholinguistic 
research on the acquisition, 
processing, production,
interpretation and memorization of linguistic expressions"(1991 :248). It also accepts
the related criterion put forth in Bresnan & Kaplan (1982) that theories of linguistic
structure should be directly relatable to testable theories of language production and
comprehension. The RRG approach to language acquisition, sketched in Van Valin
(1991 a, 1994, 1998) and Van Valin & LaPolla (1997), rejects the position that grammar
is radically arbitrary and hence unlearnable, 
and maintains that it is relatively

49
motivated (in Saussure's sense) semantically and pragmatically. Accordingly, 
there
is sufficient information available to the child in the speech to which it is exposed to
enable it to construct a grammar.

The basic organization of RRG is given in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Organization of Role and Reference Grammar
As mentioned earlier, RRG is a monstratal theory, and there is a direct mapping
or linking between the semantic representation 
of a sentence and its syntactic
representation. Each of the aspects of this figure will be explicated in the course of
the discussion.
2.1 Clause structure RRG rejects the standard formats for representing clause
structure (grammatical relations, X-bar syntax), because they are not universal and
hence necessarily impose aspects of structure on at least some languages where it is
not appropriate. This follows from the assumptions regarding a theory of clause
structure in (1).
(1) General considerations for a theory of clause structure:
a. A theory of clause structure should capture all of the universal features without
imposing features on languages in which there is no evidence for them.
b. A theory should represent comparable structures in different languages in
comparable ways.
The RRG conception of clause structure (originally proposed in Foley & Van
Valin 1984 and further developed in Van Valin 1993b), is known as the LAYERED
STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE [LSC].lt is made up of the NUCLEUS, which contains
the predicate(s), the CORE, which contains the nucleus plus the arguments of the
predicate(s), and the PERIPHERY, which contains adjunct temporal and locative
modifiers of the core. It is illustrated in Figure 2, and the semantic basis of the LSC is

These aspects of the LSC are universal. Some language have a PRE-CORE
SLOT [PRCS], which 
is the position of WH-words 
in languages like English and
Malagasy, and a LEFT-DETACHED POSITION, [LOP], which is the position of the
pre-clausal element in a left-dislocation construction or the NP marked by -(n)un in
Korean or wa in Japanese (Yang 1994). In addition, some verb-final languages have
a POST-CORE SLOT [PoCS] (e.g. Japanese; Shimojo 1995), and some languages
also have a RIGHT-DETACHED POSITION, [RDP], which is the position of the post-
clausal element in a right-dislocation construction. Each of the major layers (nucleus,
core, clause) is modified by one or more OPERATORS, which include grammatical
categories such as tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality. The LSC applies equally
to fixed word-order and free word-order languages, to head-marking and dependent-
marking languages, to languages with and without grammatical relations. It is argued
that noun phrases and adpositional phrases have a comparable layered structure;
see Van Valin (1993b), ยง 1.7, Van Valin & LaPolla (1997), ยง 2.3. Operators in the NP
include determiners, quantifiers and adjectival and nominal modifiers. In the formal
representation of the LSC (proposed in Johnson 1987), operators are represented in a

Figure 6: The LSC in Lakhota (Head-marking) and English (Dependent-marking)
2 Did is labelled both 'tense' and 'IF' in the operator projection, 
because the position of the tense
operator signals illocutionary 
force in English: core-medial 
tense signals declarative 
IF, core-initial 
(pre-
core) tense signals interrogative 
IF, and the absence of tense in a matrix core signals imperative IF. In
Croatian, declarative IF is signalled by the absence of the question particle Ii or a question word like tko,
and therefore there is no representation of a declarative IF indicator in the diagram.

Dyirbal (Australia; Dixon 1972) and Lakhota (Siouan, North America) represent
free-word-order and head-marking languages, respectively; Dyirbal is also dependent-
marking. The operator projections have been omitted in the Dyirbal and Lakhota
examples. The lines connecting the determiners to the head nouns are the operator
projection within the NP, analogous to the operator projection within the clause, as
in Figures 3-4. Both Croatian and Dyirbal exhibit discontinuous constituency, and
this is handled by means of the operator projection within the NPs, as in Figures 4
and 5. In head-marking languages like Lakhota, the bound pronominals on the verb
are considered to be the core arguments; overt NPs are within the clause in apposition
to them (Van Valin 1985, 1987). Note that despite the differences between the three
languages in Figures 4-6, comparable 
structural 
relations, e.g. core argument,
peripheral adjunct, are represented in the same way. It should be noted that these
representations are not abstract, unlike relational networks or functional structures;
they are intended to be concrete, in the sense that they should represent the actual
form of the sentence, including the linear sequence of its constituent elements and
their morphological 
properties.3
Representations of constituent projections such as these should be viewed as
syntactic templates, the inventory of which in a language constitutes an important
component of its grammar. It may be termed the SYNTACTIC INVENTORY and
complements the lexicon. RRG also employs constructional templates to characterize
the idiosyncratic features of grammatical constructions.
The three layers of the LSC are also the three basic building blocks of complex
sentences in human language. The unmarked pattern for the construction of complex
sentences involves combining nuclei with nuclei, cores with cores, or clauses with
clauses. These are called levels of JUNCTURE in RRG, i.e. nuclear juncture, core
juncture and clausal juncture. 
Clausal junctures, 
as the name implies, 
involve
sentences containing multiple clauses. Examples of nuclear junctures from French,
English and Mandarin are given in (2) and their representations are in Figure 7.
justifications 
for these structures can be found in Foley & Van Valin (1984), Van
Valin (1993b), Van Valin & LaPolla (1997).

'1 will make John eat the cakes.'
b. John forced open the door. [two nuclei, push and open, in a single core]
3 The representation 
may be abstract with respect to phonology or morphophonology, 
e.g. the
output could be in terms of abstract morphophonological 
units rather than concrete phonetic ones. RRG
is not be concerned with the issue of (morpho)phonological 
representation.

Core junctures involve two or more cores (which may themselves be internally

and their structures in Figure 8. In this type of core juncture, the two cores share a
core argument; 'sharing a core argument' is defined formally in terms of the linking
algorithm mapping syntactic and semantic representations into each other (cf. ยง 2.4).

The RRG theory of complex sentences is equally concerned with the set of
possible syntactic and semantic relations between the units in a juncture.4 The
syntactic relations between units are termed NEXUS relations in RRG. Traditionally,
only two basic nexus relations are recognized, coordination and subordination, but
RRG, following Olson's (1981) analysis of clause linkage in Barai (a Papuan language),
4 The semantic relations will be discussed in ยง 2.2 below.

Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., A Concise Introduction to Role and Reference Grammar
FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) br. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
57
postulates three nexus types: coordination, subordination, and COSUBORDINA TION,
which is in essence dependent coordination. The dependence is operator dependence;
that is, in cosubordination, 
the units obligatorily share one or more operators at the
level of juncture. 
In the Mandarin example in (2c), aspect obligatorily 
has scope
over both nuclei, and therefore the nexus is cosubordination. 
This is represented as
in Figure 9.

In (4a), the modal operator -mEII- 'ought' has scope over both cores, and
accordingly the nexus is cosubordinate; in (4b), on the other hand, the modal operator
-yAbl'- 'able' has scope only over the final core, hence coordinate nexus.s The

nexus types at the level of clausal juncture.

at the level of juncture.

The three levels of juncture together with the three nexus types create nine
possible complex sentence types. Not all of them are instantiated in every language;for 
example, Korean appears to have all nine (Yang 1994), while English appears to
have six and jakaltek (Mayan) seven. The juncture-nexus types found in a language
may be realized by more than one formal construction type; for example, both Mary
sat playing 
the guitar 
and Robin tried to open the door instantiate 
core
cosubordination, 
while both For Sam to leave now would be a mistake and Lisa's
losing her job shocked everyone instantiate core subordination in English. The ninejuncture-nexus
types may be ordered into a hierarchy in terms of the tightness of the
syntactic link between the units (see the hierarchy in Figure 12 in ยง 2.2).
2.2 Semantic structure The semantic representation in Figure 1 is based on a
system of lexical 
representation 
and semantic roles. The system of lexical
representation is based on Vendler's (1967) Aktionsart classification of verbs into
states, activities, achievements and accomplishments. There is an additional class,
called active accomplishments, 
which are telic uses of activity verbs. Examples of
each class and their formal representation are given in (6)-(7).6
(6) a. State: 
The teacher is upset about the school situation.
a'. Causative state: 
The school situation upsets the teacher.
b. Achievement: 
The bubble popped.
b'. Causative achievement: 
The baby popped the bubble.
c. Accomplishment: 
The snow melted.
c'. Causative accomplishment: 
The hot sun melted the snow.
d. Activity: 
The soccer ball rolled around the field.
d'. Causative activity: 
The girl rolled the soccer ball around the field.
e. Active accomplishment 
The soldiers marched to the barracks.
e'. Causative active accomplishment 
The sergeant marched the soldiers to the barracks.
6 This system differs in important ways from the one proposed in Foley & Van Valin (1984) and
Van Valin (1990, 1991 b, 1993).

Examination 
of the verbal 
systems of a number 
of languages 
had led to the
conclusion 
that this set of distinctions 
is one of the fundamental 
organizing 
principles
of verbal systems in human 
language.8
The RRG theory 
of semantic 
roles is rather different from that of other theories,
in that it posits two types of semantic 
roles. The first are specific 
thematic 
relations,
the traditional 
(since Fillmore 
1968 and Gruber 1965) notions of agent, theme, 
patient,experiencer, 
etc. The second 
are generalized 
semantic 
roles called 
SEMANTIC
MACROROLES; 
they were introduced 
in Van Valin (1977b) and have no exact analog
in other theories, 
although 
jackendoff's 
'action 
tier' and Dowty's 
proto-roles 
bear
some resemblance 
(see Van Valin 
1999a for more discussion). 
Following 
the ideas
of Gruber 
(196S) and jackendoff 
(1976), 
RRG defines thematic 
relations 
in terms of
argument 
positions 
in LSs such as those in (8)-(9). All thematic 
relations 
are defined
in terms of argument positions 
in state and activity LSs; all other LS types are composed
of them 
plus elements 
like BECOME, 
INGR and CAUSE, as shown 
in (7). Since
thematic 
relations 
have no independent 
status, they are really just mnemonics 
for
the argument 
positions 
in LSs. In verbs that lexicalize 
agency, e.g. murder, 
agent is
represented 
by '00 
{x, ...', following 
Dowty (1979). However, 
in most cases agent is
7 'do' (x, 0)' indicates that the nature of the causing activity is unspecified.
8 For further development 
of this decompositional 
system, see Van Valin & Wilkins (1993), Van
Valin & Wilkins 
(1996), Faber & Mairal Us6n (2000), Mairal Us6n & Van Valin (2001).

an implicature 
related to human effectors with certain types of activity predicates
and would not be represented in the lS of the verb. See Holisky (1987), Van Valin &
Wilkins (1996).
The second type of semantic role plays a central role in the theory; macroroles
acts as the primary interface between the lS and syntactic representations. There are
only two macroroles, ACTOR and UNDERGOER, corresponding to the two primary
arguments in a prototypical transitive relation. They are called 'macroroles' because
each subsumes a number of specific thematic relations; the relationship between the
macroroles and the argument positions in lS is captured in the Actor-Undergoer
Hierarchy in Figure 11.

The Actor-Undergoer Hierarchy
Given the LS of a verb, the most agent-like argument will be actor, the most
patient-like 
undergoer, 
in the default case. Macroroles 
are not equivalent 
to
grammatical relations, as shown in (9).

'The window opened.'
c. Jasna [Actor] radi u Zagrebu.
'Jasna works in Zagreb.'
d. Prozor [Undergoer] je biD otvoren.
'The window has been broken.'
The exact role of macroroles in the mapping (or linking) between semantic
and syntactic representations will be sketched in ยง2.4 and summarized in Figure 15.
As mentioned in ยง2.1, an important component of the theory of complex
sentences is the semantic relations that obtain between units in a juncture. These
include causality, psych-action, direct perception, cognition, propositional attitude,
conditional, 
and varieties of temporal sequence. These may be ordered into a
hierarchy in terms of whether the units in the juncture express facets of a single

event, state or action or distinct events, states or actions. This semantic hierarchy
interacts with the syntactic hierarchy of juncture-nexus types as follows: there is an
iconic relation between the semantics and syntax of clause linkage, such that the
tightness of the syntactic linkage directly reflects the semantic integration of the units
in the linkage (cf. Silverstein 1976, Giv6n 1980, Foley & Van Valin 1984). This is
expressed in the Interclausal Relations Hierarchy in Figure 12.'

Van Valin & Wilkins (1993) employ this hierarchy, together with an enriched
version of the system of lexical representation introduced above, to show how it is
possible to predict the syntactic form of certain types of complex sentences from
their semantic representations.
2.3 The lexicon RRG is a lexicalist theory, and therefore the lexicon plays a
very important role in it. lexical 
entries for verbs are based on lSs; the lexical
representation of nouns follows the theory of nominal qualia proposed in Pustejovsky
(1995). RRG takes the position that lexical entries for verbs should contain only
idiosyncratic 
information, with as much as possible derived from general lexica!
principles or rules. Information about transitivity is very important, and RRG defines
transitivity 
in terms of the number of macroroles that a verb takes: transitive = 2,
intransitive = 1, atransitive = O. The general principles in (10) predict the transitivity
of regular verbs.

Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., A Concise Introduction to Role and Reference Grammar
FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) br. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
64
(10) Default Macrorole Assignment Principles
a. Number: the number of macroroles a verb takes is less than or equal to the
number of arguments in its logical structure
1. If a verb has two or more arguments in its LS, it will take two macroroles.
2. If a verb has one argument in its LS, it will take one macrorole.
b. Nature: for verbs which take one macrorole,
1. If the verb has an activity predicate in its LS, the macrorole is actor.
2. If the verb has no activity predicate in its LS, the macrorole is undergoer.
In RRG, no syntactic subcategorization 
information 
is included in lexical
entries; all of the relevant information 
is derivable from the LS of the verb plus
information about its transitivity. Thus these principles have the effect of predicting
the syntactic subcategorization 
of a verb .from its semantic representation. See Van
Valin (1990, 1991 b) for application of this to the analysis of syntactic issues in Italian,
Georgian and Icelandic. All theories must stipulate the transitivity of exceptional
verbs, and this is done in RRG by specifying their transitivity in terms of [MRa],
where 'a' is 0, 1 or 2. Sample lexical entries for some English verbs are given in
(11 ).9
(11) a. kill
b. receive
c. own
d. belong (to)
e. arrive
f. seem
g. see
h. watch
i. show
j. run
k. drink
I. melt

do' (x, [run' (x)])
do' (x, [drink' (x, y)])
BECOME melted' (x)
9 These are intended 
as lexical 
representations. 
It is well-known 
that verbs can have
constructionally 
derived Aktionsartproperties, 
e.g. run, an activity verb, behaves like an accomplishment
in run to the store. Hence the semantic representation 
of a core containing 
a verb may well have a
derived LS expanding 
the LS from the lexical entry of the verb. See Van Valin & LaPolla (1997) for
detailed discussion.

Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., A Concise Introduction to Role and Reference Grammar
FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) hr. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
65
The prepositions that mark oblique core arguments can in many instances be
predicated from the LS of the verb and therefore need not be listed in the lexical
entry (cf. Jolly 1993).
RRG distinguishes lexical from syntactic phenomena in terms of the linking
scheme, as will be discussed below. Basically, any process which affects LSs or the
arguments therein or the mapping between LSs and macroroles is considered to be
lexical. Examples include causativization, regardless of whether it is morphologically
unmarked (as in English) or marked (as in Turkish and Chicewa), noun incorporation,
the 'dative alternation' (which is analyzed as variable linking to undergoer; cf. Van
Valin 1993b, Van Valin & LaPolla 1997, and Zovko 2000, 2001 for an analysis of
dative shift in Croatian), and some types of passivization and antipassivization.
Syntactic phenomena involve the mapping between macroroles and the syntactic
representation, e.g. some types of passivization and antipassivization, WH-question
formation 
in languages 
like English, 
Icelandic 
and Malagasy, 
and 'raising'
constructions (cf. Van Valin 1993b, Roberts 1995, Van Valin & LaPolla 1997).
2.4 Focus structure The issue of the distribution of information in clauses and
sentences was not addressed in Foley & Van Valin (1984), and in Van Valin (1993b)
Lambrecht's (1986, 1987, 1994) theory of FOCUS STRUCTURE is integrated into
RRG. Focus structure is the grammatical system which serves to indicate the scope
of the assertion in an utterance in contrast to the pragmatic presupposition, and it is
vital to the RRG analysis of many grammatical phenomena. An innovation in RRG is
the distinction between the potential focus domain [PFD] i.e. the syntactic domain
in the sentence where focus may fall, and the actual focus domain, i.e. the part that
is focussed in a particular sentence. Languages vary in terms of how the PFD is
restricted, both in simple sentences and in complex sentences, and this variation
underlies important grammatical differences across languages (cf. Van Valin 1993b,
1995, 1999b). The focus structure of an utterance is represented in a distinct projection
of the clause from the operator and constituent projections; this is exemplified in
Figure 13 for a predicate-focus construction in English. 'Predicate focus' is Lambrecht's
term for the traditional 'topic-comment' 
structure with a topical subject and a focal
predicate.

2.5 Grammatical 
relations and linking In the earliest work on RRG it was
argued that grammatical relations like subject and direct object are not universal
and cannot be taken as the basis for adequate grammatical theories. In place of these
notions, RRG employs the notion of privileged syntactic argument [PSA], which is a
construction-specific 
relation and is defined as a restricted neutral ization of semantic
roles and pragmatic functions for syntactic purposes. The other arguments in a clause
are characterized 
as direct or oblique core arguments; there is nothing in RRG
corresponding to direct or indirect object. See Van Valin (1993b), Van Valin & LaPolla
(1997) for detailed discussion.
The linking 
system relating 
semantic 
and syntactic 
representations 
is
summarized in Figure 15. Syntactic functions like PSA and direct core argument
(which are structurally instantiated in the LSC) represent the syntactic pole of the
system, while LSs represent the semantic pole. In every language with grammatical
relations, there is an accessibility to PSA hierarchy for multiple-argument verbs; it is
given in (12).
(12) Privileged Syntactic Argument Selection Hierarchy
arg of DO > 1 st arg of do' > 1 st arg of pred' (x, y) > 2nd arg of pred' (x, y) > arg of pred' (x)
In syntactically accusative languages like English and Croatian, the highest
ranking macrorole 
in terms of (12) is the default choice for PSA, whereas in
syntactically ergative languages like Dyirbal and Sama (Austronesian, Philippines;
Walton 1986), the lowest ranking macrorole is the default choice. That is, in a
syntactically accusative language the unmarked choice for the PSA of a transitive
verb is the actor, with the undergoer being a marked choice possible only in a passive
construction. On the other hand, in a syntactically ergative language, the unmarked
choice for the PSA of a transitive verb is the undergoer, with the actor being a marked
choice possible only in an anti passive construction. With an intransitive verb, the
hierarchy is irrelevant, as the single macrorole functions as PSA regardless of whether
it is actor or undergoer.
The overall linking system IS summarized in Figure 15. We have discussed
logical structures, macroroles and the hierarchy linking them. This part of the system
is universal, in that there is very little cross-linguistic variation; this is the domain of
lexical processes, as mentioned in ยง 2.3. Where languages differ substantially is how
macroroles and other arguments link into the syntax. The reason the arrows in Figure
15 are double-headed is that the linking system works both from semantics to syntax
and from syntax to semantics. In ยง 1 I mentioned the criterion of psychological
adequacy and in particular the point made by Bresnan & Kaplan (1982) that theories
of linguistic structure should be directly relatable to testable theories of language
production and comprehension. 
A theory which could describe the linking from
semantics to syntax only could be part of a language production system, but it would

Robert D. Van Valin, Ir., A Concise Introduction to Role and Reference Grammar
FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) br. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
68
not be adequate for a comprehension system. In such a system, the parser, as an
idealization, would take the input and produce a structured syntactic representation
of it, identifying the elements of the layered structure of the clause and the cases,
adpositions and other grammatically relevant elements in the sentence. It is then the
grammar's job to map this structure into a semantic representation, as the first step in
interpreting it, and this is where the syntax -+ semantics linking algorithm is required.
The details of the linking algorithm are given in Van Valin & LaPolla (1997). It is
constrained by the Completeness Constraint, given in (13).
Completeness Constraint: All of the arguments explicitly 
specified in the
semantic representation of a sentence must be realized syntactically in the
sentence, and all of the non-predicate elements in the syntactic representation
of a sentence must be linked to an argument position in a logical structure in
the semantic representation of the sentence.

Most of what counts as 'syntax' in many theories, e.g. case assignment,
agreement, WH-movement, 
and reflexivization, 
is handled in RRG in terms of the
syntactic phase of the linking. The analysis of reflexivization 
in RRG follows the
approach in Jackendoff (1992) and states the constraints for core-internal ('clause-
bound' in other theories) reflexivization at the LS level, not with respect to the syntactic
representation. The linking in a WH-question in English is illustrated in Figure 16.

The role of discourse-pragmatics in linking will be discussed below. Note that
there is a direct linking between the WH-word in the precore slot and the semantic
representation. 
Constraints 
on WH-question 
formation 
and other 'extraction'
constructions is explained in terms of the interaction of focus structure and syntax, in
particular in terms of restrictions on the potential focus domain (Van Valin 1993b,
1995). The c~se assignment rules for Croatian proposed in Dahm-Draksic (1997) are
given in (14) as an example; they presuppose an accusative PSA selection hierarchy.
10 The subscripts 
'ACV', 
'ACS' and 'INA' 
stand for 'activated', 
'accessible' 
and 'inactive',
respectively, 
and they refer to different cognitive statuses that a referent of the element may have; cf.
Lambrecht (1994).

FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) br. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
70
Case assignment rules for Croatian and other accusative languages
a. Assign nominative case to the highest ranking macrorole argument.
b. Assign accusative case to the other macrorole argument.
c. Assign dative case to non-macrorole arguments (default").
(14)
These rules account for case marking in simple and complex sentences,
including WH-questions. 
The linking from semantics to syntax and from syntax to
semantics in a simple sentence in Croatian is illustrated in Figures 17 and 18. The
details of the linking algorithm are presented in Van Valin & LaPolla (1997).

Figure 17: Linking from semantics to syntax in Croatian
The first step in the linking from semantics to syntax is the constitution of the
LS of the clause in the lexicon, and the next step is the determination 
of which
arguments will be actor and undergoer. This is based on the hierarchy in Figure 11:
Petar-, the first argument of do', is the actor; knjig-, the second argument of have', is
the undergoer; and zen-, the first argument of have', is a non-macrorole argument.
The next step is link these arguments to the syntax. Petar-, the actor, is the PSA,
following 
the hierarchy in (12), and the other two arguments are non-PSA core
arguments. Word order, aside from the location of the second-position clitic je, is
determined by focus structure. The case rules in (14) determine the case of the NPs:
Petar-, the actor, is the highest ranking macrorole and therefore appears in the
11 The idea of dative case as the default case for non-macrorole 
direct core arguments in languages
with morphological 
case systems is derived from Silverstein (1976, 1981, 1990). Dative is the default
case for non-macrorole 
direct core arguments, and as a default case it may be overridden with certain
verbs. See Van Valin (1991 b), Michaelis 
(1993), Van Valin & LaPolla (1997).

nominative case, following (14a); knjig-, the undergoer, is the other macrorole, and
therefore appears in the accusative case, following (14b); and zen-, a non-macrorole
core argument, appears in the dative case, following (14c). The linking from semantics

Figure 18: Linking from syntax to semantics in Croatian
The first step in the linking from syntax to semantics is determining the voice
of the verb. Since the verb is active voice in Figure 18, the PSA in the nominative
case is the actor; hence Petar is the actor. Accusative case with a transitive verb
always indicates the undergoer in Croatian, and therefore it may be concluded that
knjigu is the undergoer. The third argument, zeni, is a non-macrorole core argument.
The next step is to retrieve the LS for dati from the lexicon and assign macroroles to
it. Since x is the highest ranking argument in terms of Figure 11, it is the actor. Dati
does not allow variable linking to undergoer (dative shift) (Zovko 2000, 2001), and
therefore the lowest ranking argument, z, is the undergoer. This means that Petar is
the x argument, and knjigu is the z argument. That leaves one unlinked argument in
the syntax, zen-, and one unlinked argument position in the semantics, y, and they
must be linked in order to satify the Completeness Constraint. This yields the correct
interpretation for the sentence.
One of the questions which RRG asks is, when there is an option as to which
arguments can be linked to PSA, what factors can affect the choice? It turns out that
the answer to this question has important typological ramifications, for some languages
permit discourse-pragmatic 
factors to playa role, whereas others do not. In Figure
16 there is input from discourse-pragmatics to the linking. It is represented by the

Robert D. Van Valin, Jr., A Concise Introduction to Role and Reference Grammar
FLUMINENSIA, god. 12 (2000) br. 1-2, sIr. 47-78
72
subscripts on the referring expressions filling argument positions in the semantic
representation of the sentence (cf. fn. 10). The status of a referent in the discourse
context not only influences the form of the expression used to denote it, as is well
known, but it may also affect how arguments may be linked into the syntax in some
languages. That is, in some languages, but not all, a highly topical (activated) argument
tends to appear as PSA, regardless of its semantic function. This has been much
discussed in the literature on topic, subject and voice over the past two decades.
This distinction is expressed in the RRG contrast between SYNTACTIC and SEMANTIC
PIVOTS, on the one hand, and PRAGMATIC PIVOTS, on the other. English, Dyirbal,
Malagasy, Sama and Icelandic all have pragmatic pivots in their grammatical system,
whereas Lakhota, Warlpiri, Zapotec and Tongan do not. One of the major themes in
RRG work is the important role that discourse-pragmatics plays in grammar, and the
many ways in which discourse-pragmatics 
may affect grammatical 
processes is
summarized in Figure 19.

and grammar in RRG

Linking from Semantics to Clause Structure
Figure 20: Interaction of linking with clause projections
3. Some implications of RRG
RRG illustrates one possible answer to the questions stated at the beginning of
ยง 1, and it shows that it is possible to have a rigorous, typologically-sensitive
grammatical theory which takes semantics and pragmatics as central features.
It was mentioned in ยง 1 that Van Valin (1991 a) takes a rather strong position
with respect to the question of language acquisition, one that is at odds with most
other theories, but there is substantial empirical work supporting this view. Braine
(1992) shows how a conception of clause structure very much like the layered structure
of the clause could be constructed developmentally 
by the child. Rispoli (1991 a,b,
1994, 1995) shows how the lexical representations in ยง 2.2 and the conception of
grammatical relations in ยง 2.4 could be learned. Bowerman (1990) provides evidence
in favor of the view that rules linking syntactic and semantic representations of the
type summarized in Figure 15 are learned, and Van Valin (1994, 1998) puts forward
an account of how some of the constraints on linking between syntactic and semantic
representations in complex sentences (i.e. subjacency) could be learned. Van Valin
(2001) presents the predictions .the RRG theory of complex sentences makes about

KRA T AK UVOD U GRAMA TIKU ULOGE I REFERENCI
Ovaj clanak prikazuje temeljne pojmove gramatike uloge i referenci (GUR), gramaticke torije
koja se osobito oslanja na analizu neindoeuropskih 
jezika. Ta se teorija bavi uzajamnim
djelovanjem sintakse, semantike i pragmatike u gramatickim sustavima. GUR je jednorazinska
teorija koja pretpostavlja 
sarno jedan sintakticki prikaz recenice, neposredno povezan sa
semantickim prikazom putem algoritma povezivanja. Sintakticki prikaz strukture klauze naziva
se u GUR slojevita struktura klauze. Pretpostavlja se da se klauze beziznimno 
sastoje od
nukleusa (koji sadrzava predicirajuci 
element), jezgre (koja sadrzava nukleus i argumente
predicirajuceg elementa), i periferije (koja sadrzava vremenske i lokativne modifikatore jezgre).
Svaku razinu klauze u GUR modificiraju 
tzv. opera tori: ani ukljucuju gramaticke kategorije
kao sto su vrijeme, vid, modalnost, negacija i ilokucijska snaga. Siozene recenice sastoje se
od ovih jedinica: nukleus + nukleus tvori nuklearnu spojnicu, jezgra + jezgra tvori jezgrenu
spojnicu, a klauza + klauza tvori klauzalnu spojnicu. Jedinice u spojnici mogu uzajamno
stajati u jednom od tri odnosa: koordinacija, 
subordinacija 
i kosubordinacija. 
Na taj nacin
razlikuje se devet tipova spojnice i zavisnosti (neksusa) u univerzalnoj gramatici; tipovi spojnice
i zavisnosti koji se pojavljuju 
u pojedinom jeziku mogu se ostvariti u jednom ili u vise tipova
formalnih konstrukcija.
Semanticki prikaz recenice izgraden je na sustavu leksicke dekompozicije 
utemeljenom na
pojmu Aktionsarta. 
Taj sustav naziva se logickom 
strukturom 
(LS). Semanticke funkcije
argumenata 
definiraju 
se prema polozajima 
u LS. Za citavu teoriju temeljan 
je pojam
semanticke makrouloge; 
postoje dvije makrouloge, 
cinitelj i trpitelj. Makrouloge 
i drugi
argumenti 
povezuju 
se sa sintaktickom 
strukturom 
algoritmom 
povezivanja. 
GUR ne
pretpostavlja 
tradicionalne 
gramaticke relacije; priznaje sarno jednu gramaticku funkciju,
koja se naziva privilegirani 
sintakticki argument.
Osim sintaktickih 
i semantickih 
prikaza, 
postoji i prikaz fokusne strukture recenice. On
pokazuje apses onoga sto se u iskazu tvrdi, u opreci spram pragmaticke presupozicije. Prikaz
fokusne strukture vazan je dio analize mnogih gramatickih pojava prema GUR, a jedna je od
temeljnih tipoloskih 
teza te teorije da su vazne razlike medu gramatickim sustavima odraz
razlicitih uloga koje fokusna struktura maze igrati u gramatici, osobito u algoritmu vezivanja.
GUR prilazi usvajanju jezika tezom da djeca izgraduju gramatiku na temelju svoje opce
kognitivne sposobnosti i podataka u govoru kojem su izlozana; nije potrebno pretpostaviti
autonomni mehanizam za usvajanje jezika.
