TEACHING 
My teaching philosophy is:   
Courses.  Every subject has a few key insights from which many results flow; the the clearest presentation 
results from leaving out everything possible while still getting the key insights and consequences across; and 
people don’t really understand a subject until they teach it.  The second strategy helps arrange the order of 
presentation and reveals the logical flow of the subject. 
Laboratory research.  It is the mouse who teaches the kitten to catch mice (WR Ashby); to accomplish anything 
significant, you need to be slightly underemployed (JD Watson). 
 
As graduate teaching assistant: 
1973-74     Precalculus Mathematics, Ohio State University 
 
 
lecture/discussion sections of ~ 30 students 
1974-76     The Molecular Basis of Life, Ohio State University 
 
 
discussion sections of ~ 30 non-science majors, to accompany faculty lectures 
 
Teaching evaluations were not given, but in both courses students tended to transfer into my  
section from others, to the point where it was a bit of an administrative problem.
