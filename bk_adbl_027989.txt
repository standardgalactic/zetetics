BOX 1
The Nestedness of Industry-Location Matrices
The Ô¨Å gures below show two industry-location matrices. Each row 
represents a location, while each column represents a product or 
industry. The Ô¨Å gure on the left shows the products exported by 
each country, and the Ô¨Å gure on the right shows the tax residency 
of Chilean Ô¨Å rms. Black dots indicate the export of a product by 
a country or the presence of an industry in a Chilean municipal-
ity. In both matrices, locations are sorted in decreasing order of 
diversity, while products and industries are sorted in decreasing 
order of ubiquity. The fact that most presences agglomerate in an 
approximately triangular form in the upper-left corner of the matrix 
is known as nestedness. The solid line shows the diversity of each 
location. The diversity of a location is equal to the number of prod-
ucts exported by a country or the number of industries present in a 
municipality. The diversity line is a simple estimate of the maximum 
possible nestedness that could be observed in a matrix. If nested-
ness were perfect, the diversity line would be an almost perfect 
divider between the black and white areas.
