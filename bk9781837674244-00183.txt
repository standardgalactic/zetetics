Lamb Formula
The Lamb formula is an expression for the diamagnetic contribution,
sd, to the nuclear magnetic shielding constant of an atom:
sd ¼ e2m0
3me
ðN
0
rr(r)dr
where r(r) is the electron probability density at a distance r from the
nucleus. For a hydrogenic atom of atomic number Z with an electron
in a 1s orbital, the expression evaluates to
sd ¼
Ze2m0
12pmea0
where a0 is the Bohr radius.
Lambda Transition
A lambda transition (a l transition) is a phase transition that is not
first-order according to the Ehrenfest classification but for which the
heat capacity becomes infinite at the transition. It is so called because
the shape of the graph of heat capacity against temperature resembles
the Greek letter lambda, l (Figure L.1). Examples include order–
disorder transitions in alloys, the onset of ferromagnetism, and the
fluid–superfluid transition of liquid helium.

Langmuir–Blodgett Film
A Langmuir–Blodgett film is a layer of molecules adsorbed on a solid
substrate. Such a film can be formed by withdrawing a glass slide
from a film-coated solution. The process may be repeated to give a
bilayer. In certain cases, the second layer contributes to a bilayer that
resembles a biological cell wall.
Laporte Selection Rule
The Laporte selection rule states that for atoms and for molecules with a
centre of inversion, the only electric dipole transitions allowed are
accompanied by a change of parity: g $u. The rule arises from the fact
that the electric dipole moment has odd parity, so the transition dipole
moment is zero except for states such that one is g and the other is u, for
then g  u  u ¼ g. The selection rule is broken in vibronic transitions, in
which vibrations of the molecule remove the centre of inversion.
Larmor Frequency
The Larmor frequency, nL, of a nucleus in a magnetic field of flux
density B is
nL ¼ jgNjB
2p
where gN is the magnetogyric ratio of the nucleus. At resonance, the
applied radiofrequency field has the Larmor frequency. In the vector
model of nuclear spin angular momentum, the vector representing
the spin precesses at the Larmor frequency around the direction of
the applied field (Figure L.3).

emission of radiation. The operation of a laser relies on achieving a

population inversion, a greater number of molecules in an upper
energy state than in some lower state, and then stimulating a radia-
tive transition from the upper to the lower state (Figure L.4).
The characteristics of laser radiation and their application in
chemistry are:
1. Intense; and therefore especially useful for Raman spectroscopy.
2. Pulsed (in some cases); as the pulses may be of very short dur-
ation (down to about 1 as), phenomena can be monitored on a
very short timescale.
3. Monochromatic; and therefore suitable for application in high-
resolution spectroscopy.
4. Collimated; and therefore suitable both for high-resolution
studies of the spatial distribution of molecules and also in
Raman spectroscopy for the detection of forward-scattered
radiation.
5. Coherent; see CARS.
Lattice Enthalpy
The (standard) lattice enthalpy, DH-
L , is the change in standard molar
enthalpy when a solid converts to a vapour, as in the process MX(s) -
M1(g) þ X(g) for an ionic solid or A(s) - A(g) for a molecular or co-
valent solid. It is typically inferred from a Born–Haber cycle; for ionic
solids, it is estimated from the Born–Mayer equation. High lattice
enthalpies are characteristic of solids with strong internal binding
forces, such as ionic solids composed of small, highly charged ions.
The term is often used as a synonym for lattice energy, but the two are
identical only in the limit T - 0.

Le Chatelier’s Principle
Le Chatelier’s principle states that, a system at equilibrium responds to
a change in conditions by tending to minimize their eﬀect. For in-
stance, when the temperature is raised, the composition of a chemical
reaction at equilibrium tends to shift in the endothermic direction.
When compressed, it tends to shift in the direction that reduces the
number of gas-phase molecules. The thermodynamic basis of the
eﬀect of temperature is the variation of the equilibrium constant as
expressed by the van ’t Hoﬀequation. The basis of the pressure-
dependence is the independence of pressure of the equilibrium
constant in association with the manner in which the thermodynamic
equilibrium constant depends on the partial pressure of the partici-
pants in the reaction. That is, although dK/dp ¼ 0, the numerator and
denominator of K may both change but their ratio remains constant.
Lennard Jones Potential
The Lennard Jones potential is a model intermolecular potential energy
that expresses the potential energy of two closed-shell molecules at a
separation r in terms of two parameters, one (C6) representing the
eﬀect of attraction and the other (Cn, n 4 6) of repulsion:
V(r) ¼ Cn
rn  C6
r6
The higher power of the repulsive contribution represents its shorter
range. The form of the attractive contribution is inspired by the character

the separation. One common form of this expression is the Lennard

Level
An energy level is an allowed energy of a quantum system; it might be
degenerate in the sense that several individual states may possess the
same energy. In atomic spectroscopy a level is specifically a group of
states of an atom that have the same total angular momentum
quantum number j (for a hydrogenic atom) or J (for a many-electron
atom). Thus, a 2P term has two levels, with j ¼ 1/2 and 3/2, denoted
2P1/2 and 2P3/2, with a diﬀerence in energy due to spin–orbit coupling
(Figure L.6). The individual states of an atomic level are distinguished
by the quantum number mj or MJ, written as a right superscript, as in
2Pþ1=2
3=2 . The energy due to spin–orbit coupling of a level with quantum
numbers L, S, and J is
EL;S; J ¼ 1
2 hA{ J( J þ 1)  L(L þ 1)  S(S þ 1)}
where A is the spin–orbit coupling parameter.
Lever Rule
The lever rule (Figure L.7) expresses the relative abundances na and nb
of two components in terms of the distances along a tie line, la and lb ,
from the coexistence curves in a phase diagram as

Lifetime Broadening
Lifetime broadening is the broadening of a spectral line due to the
finite lifetime of the excited state. Solution of the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation shows that if the wavefunction decays as
et=2t(so its square modulus decays with time constant t), then its
energy lies within a range of width
dEE ˉh
t
Any transition that involves this state therefore has an intrinsic width
of this magnitude. In terms of wavenumbers:
d~n=cm1E 5:3
t=ps
Any process, such as collision, that shortens the lifetime of the state
contributes to this broadening. Every excited state has a finite lifetime
even in the absence of collisions on account of spontaneous emission,
and the resulting intrinsic spectral linewidth is called the natural
linewidth of the transition involving it. Lifetime broadening is often
attributed to the uncertainty principle and known as uncertainty
broadening, but there are technical reasons why the name and attri-
bution are inappropriate (see uncertainty principle).
Ligand Field Theory
Ligand field theory is an adaptation of molecular orbital theory used to
describe the structure of d-metal complexes and to correlate their
structural, spectroscopic, and magnetic properties. The molecular
orbitals of the complex are constructed from the d orbitals of the
central metal atom and symmetry-adapted linear combinations of

orbitals supplied by the ligands (Figure L.8). It is a more sophisticated
version of crystal field theory in which the ligands are modelled as point
negative charges. A focus of ligand field theory is the separation of the
frontier orbitals of the complex, which in an octahedral complex are
the eg and t2g combinations and their energy diﬀerence, which is
called the ligand filed splitting and denoted DO. In a tetrahedral
complex, the frontier orbitals are e and t2, and the splitting is denoted DT.
A dN complex contributes N electrons to the frontier orbitals.
The resulting configuration depends on a competition between the
size of DO and the cost in energy of doubly occupying a single orbital.
When DO is large, the lowest energy is achieved by pairing the spins
and letting them all occupy the lower t2g set of orbitals; this
arrangement results in a low-spin complex (Figure L.9). When DO is
small, the lowest energy is obtained by distributing the electrons over
the orbitals and allowing as many if them as possible to have parallel
spins; this arrangement results in a high-spin complex.

Limiting Law
A limiting law is a scientific law that is applicable with increasing
reliability as one variable of the system tends to zero. Examples of
limiting laws are the Debye–Hückel limiting law (which achieves
reliability as the ionic strength I - 0), the application of the perfect
gas law to real gases as p - 0, and Henry’s law for the vapour pressure
of solutes as c - 0. A limiting property is the limit of a property as the
concentration approaches zero, as in the limiting molar conductivity
and the limiting enthalpy of solution, the limits of these properties as
the concentration approaches zero. Limiting values avoid the com-
plication of solutesolute interactions.
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals
The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method is a
procedure for constructing molecular orbitals by expressing them
as a weighted sum of atomic orbitals, wn, of the appropriate
symmetry:
c ¼
X
n
cnwn
The coeﬃcients cn are found by applying the variation principle.
The probability that an electron described by this molecular
orbital will be found in the orbital wn, is proportional to c2
n. The
atomic orbitals that appear in the sum constitute the basis set.
Linear Momentum
In nonrelativistic classical mechanics the linear momentum, p, is the
product of the mass, m, of the body and its velocity, v:
p ¼ mv
Its magnitude, p, is the product of mass and speed, p ¼ mv. In
quantum mechanics linear momentum is represented by an operator,
which in the position representation is

The (unnormalized) wavefunctions for linear momentum p ¼ kh to
positive x (-) and negative x (’) are
c!(x) ¼ eikx;
c (x) ¼ eikx
and correspond to a wave of wavelength l ¼ h/p, in accord with the
de Broglie relation. Note that the wavefunctions for the opposite
directions of travel are related by forming the complex conjugate:
c!(x) ¼ c (x) . Real wavefunctions therefore denote stationary par-
ticles. Complex wavefunctions can be represented by plotting the real
and imaginary components on perpendicular axes (Figure L.10), in
which case the handedness of the resulting helix represents the dir-
ection of travel, with a right-hand screw corresponding to motion to
the right and a left-hand screw corresponding to motion to the left.
Linear Rotor
A linear rotor is a body with one moment of inertia that is zero and two
equal moments of inertia perpendicular to the axis of the body. Rigid
linear molecules are linear rotors. Their rotational energy levels are
specified by the quantum numbers J and MJ and are
EJ;MJ ¼ hBJ( J þ 1);
B ¼ ˉh
4pI ;
J ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . .; MJ ¼ 0; 1; . . .; J
See Figure L.11.
The partition function of a linear rotor at high temperature, when
many rotational states are occupied, is
q ¼ kT
shB
where s is the symmetry number of the molecule. The mean rotational
energy is kT and the rotational contribution to the molar isochoric
(constant-volume) heat capacity is R.

Linear Superposition
A linear superposition, F, of functions fn is
F ¼
X
n
cn fn;
F ¼ c  f
A fundamental aspect of the structure of of quantum mechanics
is that if several outcomes of an observation are possible, then the
wavefunction of the system c is a linear superposition of the
eigenfunctions of the operator corresponding to the observable:
csuperposition ¼
X
n
cncn;
csuperposition ¼ c  w
The probability that a single observation of the property O,
represented by its operator bO, will give the eigenvalue on of bO cor-
responding to the eigenfunction cn is |cn|2. The formation of a
linear superposition of the wavefunctions corresponding to pos-
sible outcomes represents a central diﬀerence between classical
and quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics, the probabilities
of outcomes are added; in quantum mechanics the amplitudes
of the outcomes, the wavefunctions, are added and then the
probability of a specific outcome is calculated by evaluating
the square of the amplitude. The latter procedure admits the pos-
sibility of interference between outcomes, such as the interference
between the paths of a particle as it travels between two points
(Figure L.12).

Liquid Crystal
A liquid crystal is a mesophase that shows structural characteristics
of liquids in some directions and of solids in others. The three
classes of liquid crystal are cholesteric, nematic, and smectic. See
those entries.
Liquid Junction Potential
A liquid junction potential, ELJ, is the contribution to the potential
of a galvanic cell that arises from the presence of an interface be-
tween two electrolyte solutions. It can be at least partially elimin-
ated by joining the two solutions with a salt bridge, a suspension of
ions in a gel.
