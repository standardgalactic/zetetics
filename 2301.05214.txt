Abstract:
It was recently shown how to account for all instantons of hermitian matrix mod-
els via (anti-) eigenvalue-tunneling—including both exponentially-suppressed and exponentially-
enhanced transseries-transmonomials which are predicted by resurgence. Matrix-model eigen-
value-tunneling corresponds to ZZ-branes.
The present work shows how matrix-model anti-
eigenvalues correspond to negative-tension ZZ-branes; and how to compute generic nonperturba-
tive sectors—with both ZZ and negative-tension-ZZ branes—in the minimal-string free-energy.
Negative-tension D-branes are herein a requirement of resurgence. This results in the construction
of minimal-string free-energy transseries and the analytic computation of their resurgent Stokes
data. Calculations are presented via Liouville boundary conformal ﬁeld theory and via (matching)
matrix model analysis. Minimal-string results are extended to Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity. Build-
ing on the matrix model analysis, one extension towards topological string theory is obtained via
the remodeling-conjecture—which allows for addressing one-cut, toric Calabi–Yau geometries.
Building on the Liouville theory calculation, one other extension towards critical string theory
is obtained via the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence—which allows for addressing negative-tension
D-instantons in AdS spacetime. Throughout, checks of the construction and formulae are made
in several examples, against both Borel resurgent analysis and string-equation transseries data.

Introduction and Summary
D-branes stand as one of the great discoveries in string theory [1, 2]. They open a remarkable
nonperturbative window with wide applications ranging from black-hole microstate counting [3]
to the celebrated AdS/CFT large N duality [4]. Playing such prominent roles, it is clear that
ﬁnding all the D-branes in a given closed-string (curved) background is of paramount importance
in the full description of the theory. This, however, is not always an easy task [5]. The literature
abounds with very interesting examples, of which an extremely partial list includes, e.g., D-branes
in minimal string theory [6–8], D-branes in WZW models [9–12, 5], D-branes in AdS spacetimes
[13–19], D-branes in Calabi–Yau geometries [20, 21], and so on and on. If in addition we recall
the myriad of diﬀerent D-branes one may encounter (e.g., diﬀerent RR charges [2], S-branes [22],
ghost D-branes [23], and the like), this immediately begs for the question: in speciﬁc problems,
how can one be sure if we indeed found them all?
On a diﬀerent line of work, and in fact much predating the discovery of D-branes, the results
in [24–27] sparked a plethora of research into the large-order growth of perturbation theory in
one-dimensional quantum-mechanics—therein regarded as another open-window into the nonper-
turbative content of these many interesting quantum problems [28–30]. Work across the years has
since shown how this is a rather generic feature, and how digging deeper into asymptotic growths
allows for unveilings of the full instanton or renormalon content of many distinct quantum and
ﬁeld theories. Translating this line of thought into string theory—historically deﬁned in an in-
herently perturbative fashion with asymptotic string-theoretic perturbative-expansion [31]—one
is immediately led to recall how the nature of its perturbative asymptotic growth was in fact a
precursor to the discovery of D-branes [32]. Might this then also be a general strategy towards
unveiling the full D-brane content of any string theory?
One context where to better frame this question is that of closed string theories associ-
ated to double-scaled multicritical hermitian matrix-models [33–37]; models which were at the
time dubbed “solvable” due to recursion-relations—obtained out of their corresponding string
equations—iteratively yielding their full perturbative data (see, e.g., [38–40] for reviews). Asso-
ciated to these perturbative data, a fair amount of nonperturbative data alongside their semi-
classical interpretation as matrix-model eigenvalue tunneling, was also obtained at the same time
[41, 42]—and these nonperturbative data were further validated against the leading large-order
growth of the corresponding perturbative sectors [43–45]. A second wave of interest in matrix-
model descriptions of string theories refocused attention upon minimal1 string theories [49, 51],
with similar properties to the aforementioned multicritical models (see, e.g., [52, 53] for reviews).
One important novelty in the minimal string story is the clear identiﬁcation of matrix model
and string theoretic quantities; in particular, the identiﬁcation of D-branes: eigenvalue-tunneling
corresponds to ZZ-branes [8], and the matrix-model holomorphic eﬀective-potential describes
FZZT-branes [6, 7]. For example, many properties of ZZ-brane instanton contributions follow
quite straightforwardly from matrix model calculations [54, 49, 55–58]. Matching of matrix model
and boundary conformal ﬁeld theory calculations in these models has further seen recent progress
in [59, 60]. But this is not the end of the story.
That there is more to this story than described above was sparked by [61], setting-up large-
order analyses for (oﬀcritical) matrix models and topological strings, later carried through in
[62, 63] beyond leading order. Resurgence [64] enters the game in [65], where resurgent transseries
neatly package together the full perturbative and nonperturbative multi-instanton content of
1Where the worldsheet matter-content is given by the minimal models of [46], and where the KdV times [47]
are now retuned from the multicritical to the conformal background (see, e.g., [48–50]).

matrix models, unveiled in the aforementioned references (see, e.g., [66, 67] for reviews). This
line of research ﬁnally led to [68], which pioneered analyzing the asymptotics of multi-instanton
sectors (in the speciﬁc Painlev´e I example), and where it was made clear that these transseries
are resonant, i.e., instanton actions always arise in symmetric pairs.
This was extended to
(oﬀcritical) matrix models and further examples in [69–72, 50] (resonance being generic for
multicritical and minimal string models [50]). Yet, the lingering question concerned the matrix-
model semiclassical interpretation of resonance.
It was recently shown in [73] that whereas
eigenvalue tunneling in the physical sheet of the matrix-model large N spectral-curve describes
the ∼exp (−1/gs) multi-instanton sectors of a resonant resurgent-transseries, it is eigenvalue
tunneling into the non-physical sheet which describes the ∼exp (+1/gs) resonant pairs (with gs
the string coupling). Now, the former correspond to minimal string ZZ-branes. One question we
address in this work is how the latter correspond to minimal-string2 negative-tension ZZ-branes.
Such “ghost” or “negative” branes3 have previously appeared in the literature [74, 23, 75, 76].
Herein, negative-tension D-branes turn out to be a requirement of resurgence.
One important aspect to the resurgent transseries constructions deals with their non-linear
Stokes data (precisely quantifying Stokes-phenomenon jumps of the asymptotic expansions). This
is what allows us to extend transseries from asymptotic series to full-ﬂedged functions; but Stokes
data is generically very hard to compute analytically. In the aforementioned Painlev´e I example,
one Stokes coeﬃcient was originally known—computed as the one-loop coeﬃcient around the
one-instanton sector associated to eigenvalue tunneling [42, 62] (extension for all multicritical
and minimal string models appeared in, e.g., [50]).
But resonance predicts inﬁnitely many
other resurgent Stokes coeﬃcients [68, 70–72, 67]. Recently, this inﬁnite set of (transcendental)
numbers was found in analytical closed-form via analysis of resonant resurgence [77], and then
received a direct matrix-model calculation via (anti) eigenvalue tunneling in [73]. Our present
work gives yet another take on these non-linear resurgent Stokes data, with a direct boundary
conformal ﬁeld theory (B-CFT) calculation via negative-tension D-branes.
One last comment concerning Stokes phenomenon connects to the results in [78]. Let us re-
call their important main point: in the semiclassical approximation observables live on branched,
possibly multi-sheeted, geometries (e.g., the large N spectral curve)—but exact quantum observ-
ables should be entire functions; which is only possible when starting from semiclassics if Stokes
phenomena intervenes in order to achieve full analyticity [78]. A somewhat similar phenomenon
was also observed in [79]. It is now clear that full analyticity entails knowledge of all possible
Stokes jumps, everywhere on the complex plane—which at the transseries level translates to
knowledge of the complete set of transmonomials at play (be them diﬀerent eigenvalue types,
diﬀerent D-branes, or whatever else). Our present construction yields the complete semiclassical
interpretation of the resurgent structure of minimal strings; fully allowing implementation of all
possible Stokes phenomena at play and ﬁnally construct exact, entire quantum observables.
The Contents of the Paper:
We begin in section 2 with a complete BCFT analysis of (p, q)
minimal string theory, including both standard and negative-tension D-branes. This is essen-
2The reader should bare in mind that whereas minimal string theory naturally includes negative-tension D-
branes, these are not the ones which we are referring to. Rather, our claim is that each positive-tension D-brane
will now have a negative-tension counterpart, and vice-versa. In other words, just like for the instanton actions,
also positive and negative-tension D-branes will always arise in symmetric pairs.
3Mostly they have been studied in the superstring context, with both NS and R sectors. As a quick reminder,
if we denote a D-brane boundary state by |D⟩= |NS⟩+ |R⟩then its anti-D-brane counterpart will be |anti-D⟩=
|NS⟩−|R⟩, but its negative-tension pair is instead |negative-D⟩= −|D⟩= −|NS⟩−|R⟩with an overall rather than
a relative minus sign. In this paper we only have overall minus signs, which will turn out to be quite non-trivial.

tially the BCFT version of the matrix model calculations in [73] and very much constructs upon
[80, 81] for the computation of disk and (regularized) annulus amplitudes (in both ZZ and FZZT
cases). In fact, we immediately address the need for such a regularization in subsection 2.1,
which we set-up (building upon [81]) via careful analytic considerations—and further compare to
the recent string ﬁeld theory regularization in [59]. Using such properly regularized amplitudes
immediately supports for both tension types of ZZ-branes, as discussed in the ensuing subsec-
tion 2.2. Calculations addressing diﬀerent possible types of ZZ- and negative-tension ZZ-brane
contributions, across diﬀerent possible sheets of the FZZT moduli space in Liouville theory, are
discussed in subsection 2.3—including explicit nonperturbative mixed sectors of the minimal-
string free-energy transseries. A generalization to pure (negative-tension) multi-ZZ-instantons is
then computed in subsection 2.4. Our ZZ-brane results are straightforwardly extended to FZZT-
branes in subsection 2.5. It is important to point out that subsection 2.3 further makes it rather
explicit how an a priori seemingly-harmless overall minus sign, associated to a negative-tension
D-brane, can become rather non-trivial. As we shall see, these negative-signs appear in expo-
nents in the integrands of Liouville amplitudes, thus leading to the appearance of integrand-poles
where one would otherwise naively expect to ﬁnd integrand-zeroes—and hence to rather diﬀerent
ﬁnal integrals for the Liouville BCFT amplitudes wherever they are featured. The avid reader
may take a sneak preview of this phenomenon in formulae (2.49) and (2.56).
In section 3 we turn to the matrix model analysis of minimal strings, now focusing upon
(p, q) = (2, 2k −1) as we mainly address the one-matrix model case. This is essentially the (de-
generate hyperelliptic) multi-pinched extension of the analysis in [73]—which can become quite
intricate at times. The calculation is generically discussed in subsection 3.1, in the context of
the double-scaling limit; and then is explicitly applied to the (2, 2k −1) minimal string theory
in subsection 3.2. These matrix model results fully match the earlier BCFT results in section 2,
as will be shown in subsection 3.2. On top of this, they are further matched against results
arising from string equations (as described in appendices A and B), so that our proposal is in
fact triple checked—as will be shown in subsection 3.3. Further supporting evidence is gathered
with resurgent large-order tests for Stokes data and Borel–Pad´e analysis for Borel singularities,
also in subsection 3.3. This supports the overall consistency of all proposal and results. The
minimal string results are then extended to Jackiw–Teitelboim (JT) gravity [82–87] in subsec-
tion 3.4, by simple application of our generic double-scaled formulae to the spectral curve of its
matrix model [88]. The resonant nature of JT gravity, which has already been addressed in [50],
is further supported by direct Borel–Pad´e analysis of its Borel singularities, and by the explicit
large k limit of the earlier (2, 2k −1) results. A very short discussion on the extension of our
matrix model calculations to the case of the two-matrix model is included in subsection 3.5.
Throughout section 3 we include many explicit calculations of non-trivial, multiple ZZ- and mul-
tiple negative-tension ZZ-instanton contributions to the minimal-string free-energy transseries,
alongside analytic computations of their non-linear Stokes data. Matrix model calculations many
times involve rather intricate integrals, and we included one generic such integral in appendix C
for the convenience of the reader who wants to reproduce our calculations.
Having gathered strong and compelling evidence for the resurgence requirement of negative-
tension D-branes within minimal string theory, one is then led to wonder if the same may hold
true across generic string theories. This is addressed in section 4, where we discuss possible
extensions towards topological string theory in toric backgrounds and towards critical string the-
ory in AdS spacetimes. The topological string extension is very much based on the fact that
the results in [73] alongside our results in section 3 are model independent, in the sense that
they only depend on spectral-curve data—and may hence be applicable in broader contexts. For

example, for topological string theory in toric Calabi–Yau geometries it is well known that apply-
ing the topological recursion [89] to the B-model mirror curve remarkably yields the topological
string free-energy expansion [90]. This procedure was later extended to topological-string nonper-
turbative instanton-calculus in [62], addressing the one-instanton sector of the local-curve toric
geometry. Subsection 4.1 revisits the local curve at nonperturbative level, showing how an analy-
sis of Borel singularities reveals the resonant nature of its nonperturbative free energy. Formulae
in [73] and our section 3 are then applied to this problem following [61, 90, 62], yielding many
predictions for the resonant nonperturbative sectors of this model (which are further checked
against their double-scaling limit towards the Painlev´e I transseries). A very brief discussion
concerning topological strings on local P2 and local P1 × P1 is also included. Turning to critical
string theory, with focus upon AdS spacetimes, at ﬁrst seems harder. But in subsection 4.2 we
build upon the remarkable H+
3 –Liouville correspondence [91–93], allowing for use of our Liouville
results from section 2 in addressing D-branes in euclidean AdS3. In this light, Liouville FZZT
branes correspond to AdS2 branes in AdS3, and the Liouville ZZ branes have D-instanton ana-
logues in AdS3 [18]. Building on our discussion of resonant negative-tension D-branes in Liouville
theory earlier on, we can thus infer on the existence of negative-tension D-instantons in AdS3.
The evidence is circumstantial as we mainly rely on the H+
3 –Liouville map—implying that due
to the natural added computational intricacies, the results herein are not as exhaustive as in
the minimal or topological string examples. We nonetheless believe they amount to clear and
supporting evidence, and further work along these directions will be reported in the near future.
A Resurgence Requirement:
Let us stress how our overall results are a direct requirement of
resurgence, simply given the nature of the large-order growth of the string perturbative-expansion.
With hindsight, in fact, one could even claim that our results are obviously expected. Consider
the perturbative expansions for either the string-theoretic free energy or the multi-resolvent4
correlation functions,
F ≃

X
g=0
Wg,h (x1, . . . , xh; t) g2g−2+h
s
(1.2)
(with t some background-geometry modulus). These expansions are asymptotic, with leading
large-order growths Fg(t) ∼(2g)! and Wg,h(t) ∼(2g + h)!. While it is very well-known how the
naive expectation where such growths would lead to nonperturbative exponential corrections of
the type ∼exp
 −1/g2
s

is incorrect—rather leading to the extremely well-known D-brane-type
nonperturbative exponential corrections ∼exp (−1/gs)—it seems that the need for the resonant
siblings ∼exp (+1/gs) has somehow escaped detailed scrutiny; but see the discussions in [70, 67].
In fact these resonant pairs are required simply so as to keep the above asymptotic perturbative
expansions in even powers of the string coupling. This is a straightforward statement on the
Borel plane (see, e.g., [67]). Taking a Borel transform B : C[[gs]] →C{s} of the above asymptotic
series (1.1)-(1.2) immediately yields parity-ﬁxed functions5,
B [F] (s) = −B [F] (−s),
B [Wh] (s) = (−1)h−1B [Wh] (−s).
(1.3)
4These are the Laplace transforms of multiple macroscopic-loop operator insertions [94, 48, 95].
5The resonant nature of multi-resolvent correlation functions is addressed in [95].
– 5 –

This simple statement immediately implies that Borel singularities are symmetrically distributed
upon the complex Borel plane s ∈C, i.e., it immediately implies the aforementioned resonant
behavior of their associated nonperturbative exponential contributions. As already mentioned,
this then leads to the minus signs which end up swapping zeros and poles inside integrands over
D-brane moduli space (as will be later be made explicit in, e.g., formulae (2.49) and (2.56)).
Moving Forward in Future Work:
At the root of the string-theoretic results reported in this
paper lies the study of the adequate analytic regularization of ZZ- and FZZT-brane amplitudes
in Liouville BCFT6. Given the centrality of Liouville theory in the whole string theory construct
[97, 98], it would certainly not come as a big surprise if the present results would be transverse to
larger classes of backgrounds. We give evidence along this direction for strings in toric Calabi–
Yau and Anti-de Sitter backgrounds. Nonetheless, further evidence and further backgrounds
are certainly required in order to make any deﬁnite statements.
For example, in upcoming
work we plan to report on the matrix-model multi-cut analysis, building on [99, 100, 63, 101].
Other models and examples we plan to address in the near future include Chern–Simons matrix
models, following upon [102–104]; and more intricate toric Calabi–Yau geometries such as local
P2 or local P1 × P1, following upon [61, 90]. Hopefully these will stand as strong stepping-stones
on the road to address ABJM gauge theory [105] along the lines of [106–110]; or the more intricate
topological-string matrix-models associated to generic toric Calabi–Yau threefolds constructed
in [111–114]. This seems to us as a solid line of research also in light of the large amount of work
which exists in the literature tackling resurgence and transseries within topological string theory;
e.g., [61, 62, 65, 63, 69, 115, 110, 116–125]. Another rather standard line of research going forward
would be to work out the supersymmetric extension of our present bosonic results, which should
be straightforward albeit possibly more technically involved. As already mentioned in [73], it
would furthermore be very interesting to automatize our whole resonant-resurgence construction
within the (nonperturbative) topological recursion framework [89, 95]. Finally, we would like to
understand which—if any—would be the consequences of our results on what concerns generic
nonperturbative corrections to the full gauge-theoretic large N expansion [126] and their eventual
role within the AdS/CFT correspondence [4].

On All ZZ-Brane Amplitudes of Minimal Strings
Let us begin by addressing the full resurgence content of D-branes in minimal string theory, build-
ing upon [80, 49, 81, 78]. This ﬁrst requires swiftly recalling some elementary data concerning
these models (see, e.g., [52, 53, 127] for reviews and a list of references). The closed-string world-
sheet CFT is composed of a (p, q) minimal model [46] describing the background; of Liouville
theory describing the conformal mode

Herein, µ is the bulk cosmological constant and b > 0 is the Liouville coupling constant. The

and the on-shell requirement of vanishing total central charge yields
b2 = p
q .
(2.4)
Moving towards minimal-string D-branes, these also factorize into D-branes of minimal mod-
els and D-branes of Liouville theory. The latter then split into ZZ-branes [8] and FZZT-branes
[6, 7]. The FZZT-branes are labeled by a continuous parameter, which is sometimes taken to be
µB, the boundary cosmological constant of the boundary term in the Liouville action

More conveniently, we shall use the uniformization variable
ζ = cosh 1
p arccosh µB
√µ,
(2.6)
and denote FZZT-branes by |ζ⟩FZZT with ζ ∈C. It is also convenient to introduce variables x
and y (which will play more prominent roles in section 3 as the spectral curve y = y(x)) as [49]
x ≡µB
√µ ≡Tp(ζ),

y ≡µ−

Herein Tp (cos θ) = cos pθ are Chebyshev polynomials of ﬁrst kind, the variables x and y satisfy
Tq(x) = Tp(y) essentially by deﬁnition, and AD is the FZZT disk amplitude. We have visualized
this Riemann surface in ﬁgure 1 for (p, q) = (2, 5). One may equally write (with pictorial notation
which will be handy as we move on) [49]
AD (ζ) =

(2.9)
This is the full D-brane tension, including a factor of gs which we may then identify as gs = µ−p+q
2p .
From now on, we follow [49, 81] and rescale µ by πγ(b2) with γ(x) = Γ(x)/Γ(1 −x).
The algebraic relation Tq(x) = Tp(y) describes a Riemann surface Σp,q which is a p-sheeted
covering of the x complex-plane, and we can label these diﬀerent sheets by simply considering
the inverse-map to Tp(ζ), which is the set [128]

In this section, we want to understand the single ZZ-instanton contribution to the minimal-string
partition-function or free-energy in a purely conformal ﬁeld theoretic fashion.
However, the
BCFT annulus amplitude AA(m, n; m, n) of two identical ZZ-branes is known to diverge [80, 81].
Explicitly, denoting the divergent ZZ annulus with a tilde, the original BCFT calculations predict

which diverges as one sets (m′, n′) = (m, n).
This problem has been addressed rather recently, in the string ﬁeld theory framework [59,
60]—where this divergence was resolved, and a ﬁnite result for the annulus amplitude from the
worldsheet perspective was obtained which perfectly matches the corresponding matrix model
calculations in, e.g., [42, 54–58, 62, 63]. It reads [60]

where the authors identiﬁed the (ℓ, k) = (1, 1) contribution as problematic: expanding F1,1(t)
as an inﬁnite sum it was observed that the zero-mode in the matter character produces a term
∼e2πt −2 which is leading and diverges as t →+∞.
In string ﬁeld theory language, this
breakdown of the integration is understood as an invalid use of Siegel gauge for the zero-modes.
Rewriting those terms using the full path-integral and undoing Siegel gauge then removes this
divergence. We refer the interested reader to [59, 60] for complete details on this calculation.
In the following we will introduce9 a diﬀerent—purely BCFT—approach to obtaining the
correct ﬁnite answer to the annulus amplitude, in a setting which will turn out to be very
natural given the connection to matrix models in [73] and in section 3. This way of performing
the calculation arises due to the relation between ZZ and FZZT boundary states [80], and thus
we ﬁrst take a short detour to recast the above ZZ discussion in terms of FZZT amplitudes.
Recall (2.15). If we further view ZZ annulus amplitudes as diﬀerences of FZZT annulus
amplitudes on the pinches of the Riemann surface Σp,q, then we may obtain the former via
saddle-point integrations over this FZZT moduli space around a pinch xmn. Note how this space
is parameterized by x = µB
√µ, but at the same time the choice of sheet changes the nature of the
FZZT-brane under consideration—in fact, as we shall extensively explore below. In other words,
the analogue of (2.20) but in the FZZT language is10

Herein α and β label the diﬀerent sheets, as in (2.10), and the superscripts in the disk and
annulus amplitudes label their corresponding gs powers. In addition, the contour Cmn is the
steepest-descent contour associated to the saddle xmn. These amplitudes have matrix model
9A very similar calculation to the one that follows was obtained from purely string ﬁeld theoretic considerations
in [128], and which further followed upon earlier work in [129].
10The ratio-of-partition-functions notation is now in full analogy with the nonperturbative contributions calcu-
lated in [62, 73], where similar ratios were computed from string-equation transseries and from matrix integrals.
All these matched each-other, as they will now further match against (2.24) in the present paper.

analogues which were discussed in [62, 73]. For α ̸= β we deﬁne the diﬀerence of FZZT disk
amplitudes as

ζβ
.
(2.25)
Using formula (2.9) we can give a nice interpretation to the above expression as an integration
over the FZZT Riemann surface starting at ζβ and ending at ζα. This is visualized in ﬁgure 2.
In addition we need the linear combination of FZZT annulus amplitudes (with all possible FZZT
annuli, this is the particular combination whose saddles will reproduce the ZZ annulus (2.21) on
the pinches of the spectral curve)

The above global factor of 1/2 comes from the cumulant expansion.
In addition, the 1/2π
prefactor in (2.24) originates from the U(1) symmetry of the FZZT boundaries (see as well
[130]). There are essentially two distinct types of amplitudes appearing in the above expression:
1. The ﬁrst of these has both boundary parameters living on the same sheet, α, is regular,
and is given via (2.14) by [81]:
AA(ζα, ζα) =
ζα
ζα

ζα −˜ζα

!˜ζα→ζα
= −log (p Up−1(ζα)) . (2.27)
Herein Up−1 (cos θ) sin θ = sin pθ are Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
2. The second type of annulus amplitudes sees its boundaries living on diﬀerent sheets, labeled
by ζα and ζβ, but projecting to the same physical location x via the uniformization map
(2.7)-(2.8). Such amplitude is divergent [81]. This is the divergence already alluded to—
given by (2.23) prior to treating the zero-mode divergence—and which was addressed for
ZZ-branes in [59]. This can be seen as follows: recall that the divergence of the ZZ annulus
in (2.23) originates in F1,1(t) behaving like ∼e2πt −2; which exactly maps to the FZZT
divergence discussed herein when spelling out A[0]

Here ZL is the annulus Liouville partition function, Zp,q the minimal-matter contribution,
and Zgh captures the ghosts. Around the ZZ singular points it is well known how to evaluate
the above and indeed we ﬁnd back the leading expression ∼e2πt −2, regularized in [59].
We propose that, on the FZZT-brane side, the required regularization comes down to:
AA(ζα, ζβ) =
ζα
ζβ
= log (ζα −ζβ) .

This expression for the FZZT annulus has its history: it is discussed at length in the
original computation of the annulus [81]. An additional exposition motivated by matrix
model calculations is provided in [78], and a detailed string ﬁeld theory analysis in [128].
Having established a (alternative) regularization procedure let us check it by testing if our
purely BCFT calculation matches the string ﬁeld theory considerations in [59, 60]. Combining
all of the results above, we ﬁnd for the contribution of the annuli

Next we have to evaluate the integral (2.24), which we do using saddle-point integration. Let us
perform this computation explicitly as it will clarify the relation between the sheets labeled by
α, β and the saddle-point labeled by m, n. The saddles of this integral are given by the zeros of
∂xA[−1]

Here we have made the identiﬁcation11 of labels m = |β −α| between our labeling of sheets
on the one hand, and the standard labeling of pinches in the Riemann surface Σp,q on the
other [78].
Notice how the sheets α, β interplay with the label m but not directly with the
label n of the a priori chosen saddle-point xmn in this identiﬁcation. This calculation again
underlines how we may view the ZZ disk amplitudes (labeled by (m, n)) as disk “FZZT diﬀerence”
amplitudes (labeled by (α, β)) on the saddles of the integral (2.24). The information about the
sheets that touch at xmn = x(ζ±

To conclude this subsection let us emphasize again that the above calculation was a purely
BCFT calculation. Moreover, the FZZT annulus regularization (2.29), which had already been
discussed in the literature, is now further supported by the demonstration that it is in fact
required so as to match to the corresponding string ﬁeld theory ZZ regularization in (2.22).
2.2
Resonant Resurgence from the Worldsheet
Having established the one-instanton calculation purely from BCFT, let us investigate it more
closely in light of the resonant (anti) eigenvalue pairs recently proposed in [73]. Indeed considering
the general expression (2.24) and swapping sheets (meaning exchanging α and β) will produce a
minus sign in the disk contribution—immediately evident in formula12 (2.25). This is consistent
with reversing the integration direction of the Bmn B-cycles which correspond with each saddle-
point xnm of the minimal-string FZZT Riemann surface (2.7)-(2.8) (again visualized in ﬁgure 3 in

This establishes the parallel that while eigenvalues correspond to ZZ-branes, anti-eigenvalues now
correspond to (pairwise) negative-tension ZZ-branes fully explicitly13. Let us explore this next.

On Boundary CFT for Generic ZZ-Instanton Contributions
Having established a BCFT formulation of the one D-instanton contribution in our previous
subsection 2.1, we can now ask what a general two D-instanton calculation might look like.
Interestingly, we can capture the general two D-instanton amplitude in a single double-integral,
which, depending on the choice of sheets for the disks and annuli and the saddle-points we
13Let us stress an important point on conventions.
As mentioned in appendix B of [81], there is a relative
minus sign between the ZZ disk-amplitudes on the BCFT side, and the holomorphic eﬀective-potential on the
matrix-model side. This diﬀerence implies a reversal of the direction of integration between the deﬁnition of ZZ
branes on the BCFT side, and the deﬁnition of eigenvalue tunneling on the matrix model side. In other words,
there will be a reversal of directions between the cycles drawn throughout our present section 2, describing the
usual exp(AD(m, n)) ZZ branes in BCFT language and starting at the physical sheet and ending at the unphysical
sheet; and the cycles implicit throughout the upcoming section 3 (explicitly shown in [73]), describing the usual
instanton contributions as eigenvalue tunneling from the cut to the physical sheet on the matrix model side.

integrate around, will produce diﬀerent nonperturbative contributions. As we shall later see in
section 3 these contributions precisely match the matrix model expectations. In the following
we will view the αβ sheet-labels as belonging to the FZZT labeled by x (integrated around the
saddle xmn) whereas γδ label the ˜x-FZZT (integrated around the saddle x ˜m˜n). This is visualized
throughout ﬁgures 2, 3, 4 and 5. The integral to consider reads

As mentioned above, depending on the choice of sheets in the form of α, β, γ, δ and the saddle-
points xmn and x ˜m˜n, we will produce diﬀerent nonperturbative contributions. We may split them
into the following three cases:
1. ( ˜m, ˜n) = (m, n), γ = α, δ = β, α ̸= β: This corresponds to a (2, 0) conﬁguration for the non-
perturbative saddle xmn, i.e., both FZZT branes localize around the same saddle (with the
same sheet conﬁguration) and one ends-up with two ZZ branes and no negative-tension
ZZ branes—which also explains the (2, 0) notation. This is visualized in ﬁgure 4. Let us
evaluate the integral (2.44) under the above assumptions. It is useful to ﬁrst rewrite (2.45)
for A[0]

sign from the corresponding logarithmic term in (2.46)) will eﬀectively produce an inverse
Vandermonde-like contribution in the integrand of (2.44); i.e., a double pole contribution.
The integral for the (1, 1) conﬁguration is written as

.
Comparing (2.56) above with our earlier (2.49) we ﬁnally see how the seemingly harmless
negative-tension minus-sign has grown to prominence: it has traded an integrand zero in
(2.49) with an integrand pole in (2.56), hence leading to a rather diﬀerent end result for the
amplitude. In order to compute this integral properly we need to reconsider our admissible
integration contours in light of this pole in the integrand. As explained in [73] these contours
are sorted by their behavior at inﬁnity and by which saddles they cross—we no longer just
have to consider steepest-descent contours but also closed contours that pick up residue
contributions. As it turns out, to lowest order in gs we will not encounter any saddle-point
integrals but simply ﬁnd a residue contribution arising from the poles in the integrand15.
Skipping the details in [73], the bottom line is that the integration contour for x is a closed
contour encircling the endpoint a of the cut of the FZZT surface and our saddle-point xmn,
while the ˜x contour is still the steepest-descent contour. Then after performing the residue
integration one ﬁrst ﬁnds

(2, 5) minimal string. The ﬁgure illustrates how each pair α, β denotes one full B-cycle associated
to the saddle point x1,1. In comparison with ﬁgure 4, we now see how for the ﬁrst pair α, β, the
integration cycle (blue) starts on sheet β = 0 and ends on sheet α = 1; whereas for the second
pair the integration cycle (orange) reverses direction and starts on sheet α and ends on sheet β.

Observe that we have obtained the two lowest orders in gs but to compute the next order
the bi-annulus amplitude would be required. This caveat may be circumvented by resorting
to the matrix model. Indeed, as we shall see in section 3, this coincides with the result
obtained from the double-scaling limit of the matrix model result in [73].
As another
independent check, in section 3 we will further verify this result by comparing against
direct calculations from the string equations for the arbitrary (2, 2k −1) minimal string.
3. ( ˜m, ˜n) ̸= (m, n): When considering distinct saddles, there is now no a priori restriction
on the sheets. For example, this can correspond to conﬁgurations of the type (1, 0)(1, 0)
or any permutations thereof—where two (negative-tension) ZZ-branes occupy two distinct
saddles. Two such possible conﬁgurations are illustrated in ﬁgure 6. For standard ZZ-
branes this case has been studied [60], but which now needs extension to the new missing
conﬁgurations.

αβ,γδ needs no further treatment and we may proceed directly to the

We conclude the discussion emphasizing our main message once again. In the above calcula-
tions, we have found a highly non-trivial distinction between case 1, a familiar result previously
explored in the literature, and case 2, a more recent result explored in the matrix model context
in [73]. It is striking that these rather distinct features (e.g., poles versus zeros in the integrand)
have been obtained by allowing a seemingly minuscule change in our considerations: the ﬂipping
of signs of the (FZZT diﬀerences) disk and annulus amplitudes, A[−1]
αβ
and A[0]
αβ,βα. Such seem-
ingly small distinction at the level of FZZT amplitudes, or indeed ZZ amplitudes, might naively
and a priori not be expected to yield such diﬀerent results. However, as we have seen, this
minus sign has the eﬀect of turning zeros into poles in the integrand and vice-versa, which ends
up having highly non-trivial eﬀects when it comes to performing the integration. It would be
very interesting to explore the possibility of obtaining the very same results as in case 2 without
the use of saddle-point integration of FZZT amplitudes, but rather by directly considering ZZ
amplitudes (e.g., as was done in [59, 60]). If indeed possible, the repercussions of the minus sign
will have to manifest themselves in some diﬀerent, perhaps string ﬁeld theoretic way.

Multiple Mixed Conﬁgurations:
Moving towards multiple mixed (negative-tension) D-
instanton conﬁgurations leads to increasingly harder integrals. Having explained our main BCFT
message in the (above) context of double-integrals, let us next outline the calculations for the
(2, 1) and the (1, 1)(1, 0) triple-integral conﬁgurations. The procedure is now always the same,
albeit increasingly more technically involved. We ﬁnd:
1. The (2, 1) Sector: First consider the nonperturbative contributions to the free energy arising
from the (2, 1) sector. These have recently been computed using matrix integrals in [73],
where they were of particular interest also in demonstrating the universality of the γE
Euler–Mascheroni constant in the Stokes data of hermitian matrix models.
Herein we
shall obtain the same conclusion, now in BCFT. To set-up this calculation one needs to
consider an integral over D-brane moduli space which yields two ZZ-branes on a pinch,
xmn, alongside one negative-tension ZZ-brane on the same pinch. Based on our earlier
experience, we consider the integral

(2.65)
where the integration contours Cmn are steepest-descent contours associated to the saddle
xmn, together with the corresponding residue contributions [73], and ¯Cmn is the steepest-
ascent contour associated to xmn. Note how the above combination of (regular) annuli
is chosen so that they precisely match the six possible ZZ interactions that we expect—
and each of these is then rewritten in terms of the appropriate FZZT diﬀerences which
will produce the corresponding ZZ interaction on the saddles of the above triple-integral.
The evaluation of the integral (2.65) now follows in the spirit of [73]—indeed, once the
BCFT analysis leads to the relevant diagrammatics as an integral over D-brane moduli
space, the evaluation of this integral is then completely analogous to its matrix model
counterpart. Using the expressions for the annulus established above, and subtracting-out
product contributions (i.e., focusing on the true novel contributions associated to the (2, 1)
sector; see [73]) we then ﬁnd

2. The (1, 1)(1, 0) Sector: Finally, let us address the (1, 1, 1, 0) nonperturbative contribution:
where we consider a ZZ-brane of type (n1, m1), alongside its negative-tension counterpart;
and an additional ZZ-brane of diﬀerent type (n2, m2) ̸= (n1, m1). This leads to an integral
of the form

contour (and the same for Cm2n2). The αβ labels relate to the saddle-point xm1n1 whereas
the γδ ones describe the multi-sheeted structure around xm2n2. Following the methods
developed in [73], we ﬁrst notice that—in analogy with the above (2, 1) sector—it makes
sense to factor-out speciﬁc product contributions which add nothing new to the calculation,
and rather focus on the true novel contributions associated to this sector. Evaluating the
integral at lowest gs order yields

Multiple ZZ- and Negative-Tension ZZ-Instantons
Having gathered calculational evidence for the role and corresponding amplitudes associated
to both ZZ- and negative-tension ZZ-branes in Liouville BCFT, let us next address the case of
multiple pure (negative-tension) ZZ D-instantons. We recover results in the literature concerning
multiple ZZ-instantons, and enlarge this class to also include negative-tension ZZ-instantons.
Starting oﬀwith the integral for ℓmultiple ZZ D-instantons we ﬁrst consider16

Notice now the appearance of a more general Vandermonde-like determinant, of dimension ℓ, as a
direct generalization of splitting the annulus contributions in “regular” and “logarithmic” parts as
in equations (2.46) and (2.53). This saddle-point integration is straightforward to perform, albeit
for completeness we ﬁll in some of the steps below. Firstly, expanding around xi = x⋆+ λi√gs

by minus signs17. Ensemble, these two formulae (2.74) and (2.77) are an example of a more
general case of the resonant behavior alluded to in subsection 2.2.
It is also interesting to
compare these formulae (2.74) and (2.77) with the corresponding multi-instanton formulae, for
pure eigenvalue tunneling and for pure anti-eigenvalue tunneling, in [73]. This is a well-known
phenomenon that is sometimes dubbed backward-forward relation [77, 73].
2.5
Boundary CFT for Resurgent FZZT Branes
Having understood ZZ D-instantons from a BCFT perspective we can ask if this also gives us
some leverage on negative-tension FZZT-brane calculations. A natural question to pose would
be if resonance also naturally extends to those contributions, possibly due to the multi-sheeted
nature of the FZZT moduli space. Such nonperturbative contributions would appear for example
in the study of the large-order behavior of correlation functions of the type
Wh (x1, . . . , xh) = ⟨O(x1) · · · O(xh)⟩,
(2.79)
where O(x) denotes a macroscopic-loop operator (i.e., a worldsheet partition-function with ﬁxed
boundary length) or a resolvent operator for example.
This type of FZZT nonperturbative
contributions and their large-order eﬀects may be found in [95], in the JT-gravity context.
Let us start with the discussion of a single FZZT-brane with boundary parameter on the
sheet α.
The argument is the same as before: the combinatorics of boundaries leads to an
exponentiation of the disconnected surfaces [1] and we thus ﬁnd the contribution18

17We stress yet once again that although the minus sign in the exponent only trivially alters contributions of
purely negative-tension conﬁgurations, its eﬀect in mixed sectors is the furthest from trivial: it introduces poles
in the integrands and therefore a completely novel set of predictions emerged.
18Recall that the annulus contribution herein does not need to be regularized.

where the disk and annulus were already computed in (2.13) and (2.27). It is interesting to study
the above expression in more detail. There are two cases to consider:
1. We start with (p, q) = (2, 2k −1) for simplicity, as in this case the FZZT moduli space is
just double-sheeted. Those sheets are labeled by α ∈{0, 1} where α = 0 is the canonical
choice for the physical sheet. Calculating the D-brane tension we ﬁnd (similarly to our
earlier ZZ story) a resonant pair associated to the two-sheets (this is in some sense the

(2.81)
This implies that for (p, q) = (2, 2k −1) minimal string theories the nonperturbative struc-
ture of FZZT-brane contributions is quite similar to the structure of ZZ contributions.
2. The story changes when considering p > 2. Then the moduli space has more sheets and the
relation between the disk amplitudes on the diﬀerent sheets will be more complicated (even
though it still is resonant, it will be so in a more intricate way). Here the nonperturbative
structure of FZZT contributions will fundamentally diﬀer from the ZZ story outlined above.
The hermitian matrix model analogue of the above calculation is well-known and we follow
[62, 73]. We will come back to this in the next section 3, but for the moment consider M a N ×N
hermitian matrix, V (x) the matrix model potential, Vh;eﬀ(x) the corresponding holomorphic
eﬀective potential, and with A0;2(x, x) to be found in [73]; so as to write

Upon double-scaling, (2.80) and (2.82) agree and a detailed discussion may be found in [88].
Having established the resurgent resonance of a single FZZT-brane, we can ask for the general
case. With all we have said above, it is not complicated to arrive at

(2.83)
Let us quickly comment on this result. The one obvious diﬀerence between (2.83) and the FZZT
amplitudes in earlier subsections is that we are now no-longer writing diﬀerences of FZZT-branes.
Those diﬀerences are convenient to use as the choice of base-point for the FZZT integration in,
for example, (2.9) drops out. Herein we are interested in exactly one FZZT brane and so we have
to deal with this intricacy19. More on this question may be found in [78, 88]. In addition, for
xi ̸= xj the above annulus contributions are all well-deﬁned and there is need of regularization
19Writing diﬀerences of FZZT amplitudes in comparison to single ones will contribute a factor of 2 in the result
for the minimal string branes: in the latter case we consider half-cycles (single FZZT branes) while in the former
case we have a full-cycle (diﬀerence of two FZZT branes). It would be interesting to compare the two approaches
further. Note how the distinction in these two approaches is responsible for the well-known diﬀerence of a factor
of 2 between matrix-model instanton actions and minimal-string ones (for example, compare to formula (2.82)).

(up to the inﬁnite constant terms which can appear [88]). Finally, depending on the choice of
sheets characterized by {αi}, (2.83) will calculate diﬀerent nonperturbative contributions.
Let us consider some instructive examples of formula (2.83). We have already seen the one-
brane contribution above. The generalization to ℓbranes of the same type (i.e., with x1 = x2 =
· · · = xℓ≡x and α1 = α2 = · · · = αℓ≡α) is straightforward and reads

where we have included a symmetry factor of 1/ℓ!, and the annulus contribution needs no reg-
ularization and is computed via (2.27). Let us mention in passing that for (p, q) = (2, 2k −1)
a resonant pair (α = 0 and α = 1) will emerge from (2.84) exactly as described in and below
formula (2.80). Further, it is interesting to understand the FZZT analogue of the (1, 1) contri-
bution earlier discussed for ZZ-branes. Explicitly choosing (p, q) = (2, 2k −1), and α1 = 0 and
α2 = 1, we ﬁnd

(2.86)
First, as x2 →x1 the disk contributions in the exponential cancel each other. This discussion is
analogous to the one in (and under) formula (2.56) (just that here we do not perform integrations
over FZZT moduli as in the earlier ZZ case). Further, from the annulus contributions we ﬁnd
a divergence as x2 approaches x1. This is again in line with the discussion in subsection 2.3.
Physically, the term 1/(x1−x2) implies that FZZT-branes on diﬀerent sheets behave a lot like the
eigenvalue–anti-eigenvalue pairs discussed in [73]. Two FZZT branes attract, and if they do so
close to a pinch of the moduli space they form a bound state—exactly as discussed in the previous
subsection. On the other hand if they meet somewhere else on moduli space, they just annihilate.
Last but not least let us comment on a curious fact: the above (1, 1) nonperturbative contribution
appears for example as a nonperturbative correction to the correlator W2(x1, x2) =
1
(x1−x2)2 (· · · )
[62], which itself is intricately related to the Bergmann kernel that plays a prominent role in
the topological recursion construct [89] (in appropriate coordinates it is just a double-pole as
x2 →x1). In fact, the Bergmann kernel sets up the computation of perturbative contributions
in the recursion, and it is hence quite interesting how the above (1, 1) correction appears to show
a similar coordinate behavior. This could hint that this kernel may yet also play some relevant
role in the computation of nonperturbative corrections via the topological recursion (see [95]).

All Instantons of Nonperturbative Minimal Strings
Let us now turn to the matrix model analysis. This will ﬁrst consist of a multi-pinched (de-
generate hyperelliptic) generalization of [73], which can then be applied to the double-scaled
– 25 –

minimal-string spectral curves of [49] so as to ﬁnd a match against20 the (p, q) = (2, 2k −1)
BCFT results across the previous section. Such results also allow for a study of JT gravity [88].

Exponentiation of the Vandermonde determinant ∆(λ) naturally leads to the introduction of
the holomorphic eﬀective potential Vh;eﬀ(x) from where the large-N (at ﬁxed t = gsN ’t Hooft
coupling [126]) spectral-curve y(x) follows as V ′
h;eﬀ(x) = y(x) [132, 133]. This is the prime input
for the topological recursion [89], which then yields the matrix-model free energy F = log Z
genus-by-genus as Fg(t), as an asymptotic perturbative expansion in the string coupling.
If the matrix-model potential V (λ) has s critical points, the most general eigenvalue conﬁg-
uration will have support on a multi-cut conﬁguration C = [a1, a2] ∪[a3, a4] ∪· · · ∪[a2s−1, a2s],
with corresponding hyperelliptic spectral curve

(3.2)
where M(x) is the moment function. Distributing the total N eigenvalues across these s-cuts, it
is natural to associate partial ’t Hooft couplings ti = gsNi with each cut. These are moduli for
the matrix model, albeit ﬁxed to adding up to the total ’t Hooft coupling t. We will be interested
in the minimal-string double-scaling limit, with all degenerate cuts but for the perturbative cut,
hence geometrically corresponding to a multi-pinched spectral curve.
In particular, we are interested in the spectral curve description of (p, q) = (2, 2k−1) minimal
string theory following [49]. These models are described by
Tp(y) = Tq(x),
(3.3)
where recall Tp (cos θ) = cos pθ are Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind.
This geometry
describes a p-sheeted covering of the complex x-plane, which is obtained from a degenerate
hyperelliptic spectral curve with 1
2 (p −1) (q −1) pinched A-cycles in the double-scaling limit—
hence resulting in a genus-zero Riemann surface, i.e., we ﬁnd a double-scaled single-cut along
C = (−∞, 1]. This is essentially the Riemann surface Σp,q of section 2 [78], where the eigenvalue
complex x-plane is identiﬁed with µB as in (2.7). In our one-matrix model scenario this simpliﬁes,
as T2(y) = 2y2 −1, and the double-scaled spectral curve becomes

20We mainly address the one-matrix model throughout this section, albeit we will comment on possible future
research venues to fully extend our results to the two-matrix model in subsection 3.5.
21Note that there is a minus-sign diﬀerence between conventions herein and the ones used in [50]. The reason
for this is so that in the following subsections we match notation against the matrix model results in [73], where
eigenvalue tunneling to the physical sheet is related to the saddles of Vh;eﬀ(x). This is also consistent with the
diﬀerence in the sign of the exponent between sections 2 and 3 (recall footnote 13 in subsection 2.2).

3.1
Arbitrary Double-Scaled Spectral Geometry
We begin by reconsidering the matrix-model predictions for various transseries sectors in [73]
and extend them to our multi-pinched, double-scaled conﬁgurations.
On Transseries Sectors from Matrix Models:
Let us immediately specialize to the one-cut
setting with s = 1 in (3.2) and C = [a, b],
y(x) = M(x)
p
(x −a)(x −b),
(3.7)
where the moment function M(x) has multiple zeros x⋆
1, x⋆
2, . . ., as nonperturbative saddle
points. There is one additional subtlety appearing in this multi-saddle-point case in comparison
to the single-pinch considered in [73]: depending on the locations of the x⋆
i , (anti) eigenvalue-
tunneling may now also happen in-between nonperturbative saddles. For example, a previously
perturbative eigenvalue might ﬁrst tunnel to x⋆
1 and only then, upon crossing the next Stokes
line, will it tunnel to x⋆
2—where the saddle-point x⋆
2 would otherwise never be directly reachable
by tunneling straight from the perturbative-cut. For this reason, the conﬁguration of saddle
points is crucial and here we shall only consider the two saddles closest to the cut (x⋆
1 and x⋆
2).
The generic case with an arbitrary number of nonperturbative saddles may then be obtained
straightforwardly building on our ensuing discussion.
More speciﬁcally, focus upon the following setting: both saddles lie on the real line, with
x1 siting closer to the cut than x2. In addition we require the instanton actions to be real and
labeled analogously to the saddles; such that A1 is associated to x1 and A2 to x2. Furthermore
we require that A1 and A2, although themselves resonant, do not resonate between each other.
One such conﬁguration is depicted in ﬁgure 7. The fact that the instanton actions are both real
and resonant [73] implies that the problem we are studying has two Stokes lines: a forward one
along the positive real axis, and a backwards one across the negative real axis (see ﬁgure 9).
Following the notation introduced in [73], we denote the corresponding partition-function
and free-energy matrix-model nonperturbative contributions as
Z(ℓ1|¯ℓ1)(ℓ2|¯ℓ2),
F(ℓ1|¯ℓ1)(ℓ2|¯ℓ2),
(3.8)
where ℓ1 (¯ℓ1) (anti) eigenvalues sit at x⋆
1 and likewise for x⋆
2 (generically ℓ1 ̸= ¯ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2 ̸= ¯ℓ2).
The above matrix-integral quantities may alternatively be computed out of string equations
(more on this in appendices A and B). Again following the notation in [73], string-equation
nonperturbative transseries-sectors are now denoted with standard22 “roman notation”, and the
22Recap notation: transseries as Z and F, matrix-integral as Z and F, and BCFT as Z and F.

(3.9)
where σ is the four-dimensional vector of transseries parameters, A1 and A2 are resurgent in-
stanton actions, and F (n)(gs) are nonperturbative transseries sectors. These sectors are usually
labeled as n = (n1, m1, n2, m2) to distinguish from the (anti) eigenvalue labeling in (3.8), albeit
they are of course in correspondence as we discuss below [73]. In short, (anti) eigenvalue tunnel-
ing is associated to instantons on the (non) physical sheet, producing exponentially suppressed
∼e−ℓA/gs (enhanced ∼e+¯ℓA/gs) contributions associated to action A. For a particular single
A, these contributions span a two-dimensional lattice of nonperturbative contributions labeled
by (ℓ|¯ℓ) where the two directions are then in resonant correspondence with the suppressed (en-
hanced) instantons in the transseries. The general case would include an arbitrary number of
resonant instanton actions; e.g., [67, 50].
Let us start by understanding the intricacies of eigenvalue-tunneling in the setting described
above. It has been thoroughly established how to populate the saddle x⋆
1 in [73]. Namely, starting
with the perturbative-sector we can undergo a forward discontinuity which tunnels eigenvalues
to the saddle x⋆
1; or we can undergo a backward discontinuity which tunnels anti-eigenvalues to
x⋆
1 (see ﬁgure 9). Interestingly, both options leave the second saddle-point x⋆
2 empty. Given that
there are only forward and backward Stokes lines, this implies that there is no direct tunneling
from the perturbative-cut to x⋆
2. On the other hand, having ﬁrst populated x⋆
1, it is now possible
to tunnel eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues from there to x⋆
2.
In other words, if we wish to
populate x⋆
2, we ﬁrst need to populate x⋆
1 and only thereafter tunnel to x⋆
2. Let us illustrate
this procedure with the example of a single eigenvalue. The ﬁrst step, where an eigenvalue has
left the cut in favor of x⋆
1, is well-known [62, 73] (see ﬁgure 8). On the matrix model side this
eigenvalue-tunneling contour-deformation reads

Figure 8: Schematic visualization of tunneling one eigenvalue from the perturbative-cut to the
saddle x⋆
2, using the matrix-model potential in ﬁgure 7. First (upper row), undergoing a forward
discontinuity with the perturbative conﬁguration tunnels an eigenvalue from the perturbative-cut
to x⋆
1 (here the cut of the eﬀective potential is visualized in green; the nonperturbative saddles
are shown in red; the eigenvalue steepest-descent contours are schematically plotted in blue; and
ϵ denotes the oﬀset of the argument of gs coming from the discontinuity). The corresponding
Borel plane picture is shown on the right, where the residue attached to the action A1 is picked
up (we only show the singularity relevant for our transition). Second (lower row), we undergo the
backwards discontinuity starting from the (1|0)(0|0) conﬁguration. Because we are employing
the backwards discontinuity the phase of gs has shifted by π. We observe how the backwards
discontinuity indeed populates the second saddle x⋆
2 in this way. Notice also the appearance of
an additive perturbative term in this transition which has been studied in [73]. Again on the
right-hand side we show the Borel plane with the singularity shown in red.
where we follow the notation from [73], and C⋆
1 is the steepest-descent contour associated to x⋆
1.
Furthermore we have the well-studied “bridge” relation [41, 62, 73]

1 to the furthest saddle x⋆
2. This contour deformation
occurs at the backwards discontinuity as illustrated in ﬁgure 8, and we focus only on the (0|0)(1|0)
contribution of the full discontinuity23. We arrive at

On the resurgent-transseries side, the backward discontinuity of the (1, 0, 0, 0) contribution at
leading exponential damping amounts to

(3.13)
Now comparing the matrix-integral calculation with the resurgent transseries, in the spirit of
[73], we ﬁnd the “bridge” relation

Z(0,0,1,0)(t, gs)
Z(0,0,0,0)(t, gs) ≃Z(0|0)(1|0)(t, gs)
Z(0|0)(0|0)(t, gs).
(3.14)
It is interesting to compare this result with the one for the (1, 0, 0, 0) sector in (3.11). At ﬁrst one
might have expected the Borel residue S(0,0,0,0)→(0,0,1,0) to appear in (3.14)—but this Borel residue
actually vanishes as there is no direct tunneling between the cut and the x⋆
2 saddle. This explains
the appearance of a more complicated combination of Borel residues in (3.14) (as we have to walk
two “resurgent steps” to arrive at the (0, 0, 1, 0) sector). On the other hand it is interesting to
note how the (0, 0, 1, 0) transseries sector is still computed around the nonperturbative saddle
x⋆
2. In fact, only the structure of its Borel residue pre-factor has changed.
We are now in a position to brieﬂy outline the full tunneling mechanics for the example
of the matrix-model potential depicted in ﬁgure 7. Eigenvalues (anti-eigenvalues) sitting in the
perturbative cut tunnel to the nonperturbative saddle x⋆
1 at the forward (backward) discontinuity.
This is exactly the scenario outlined in [73]. Now, including the second nonperturbative saddle-
point x⋆
2, this picture needs generalization. Tunneling directly from the cut to x⋆
2 is impossible,
as outlined above. On the other hand tunneling between the two nonperturbative saddles can
happen, albeit with a twist: now eigenvalue tunneling occurs at the backwards discontinuity,
whereas anti-eigenvalues tunnel at the forward discontinuity. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 9.
Armed with the full tunneling-mechanics for the doubly-pinched case, let us expand on the
above example with the (novel) calculation of the (1|1)(1|0) free-energy contribution (this will
add to our upcoming non-trivial checks). Following [73] and the arguments outlined above we
arrive at this sector by undergoing a forward discontinuity, picking up the (1|0)(0|0) contribution,
and then undergoing a backwards discontinuity. This result contains the (0|1)(1|0) contribution,
which we pick out.
Then we are left to undergo a ﬁnal forward Stokes transition to reach
(1|1)(1|0), and this will be our focus in the following. Carrying out this procedure carefully for
both resurgent-transseries and matrix-integral quantities described above, yields the “bridge”
relation between both as (we refer the reader to [73] for details on this type of calculations)

The physical sheet is plotted in blue and the

closest to the cut (x⋆
1) is exactly the same as discussed in [73] the picture needs generalization
for the second saddle (x⋆
2), which cannot be directly reached from the perturbative cut.
In-
stead, it gets populated by tunneling starting from the closer nonperturbative saddle (x⋆
1). This
comes with an inversion relative to the standard picture, as now eigenvalues (blue) tunnel at the
backward discontinuity while anti-eigenvalues (orange) tunnel at the forward one.

24Note how for the (1, 1, 1, 0) free-energy sector the overall lowest-appearing order is √gs, whereas for the matrix-
integral contribution (1|1)(1|0) the lowest-order appears at 1/√gs. This order is assembled by the product of the
(1|1)(0|0) and (0|0)(1|0) contributions—sectors which have been calculated in [73]. Although this is a good check
on our earlier results, it yields no new information. Therefore we can cancel those terms on both sides of (3.15).
25Amplitude deﬁnitions are in formula (3.30) of [73], where A0(x, ¯x) = 2A0;2(x, x) + 2A0;2(¯x, ¯x) −4A0;2(x, ¯x).

One interesting feature of this result is the appearance of a logarithmic contribution which is
not directly associated to resonance (e.g., compare with the logarithmic contributions in [73]).
Furthermore, note how the pre-factor of the logarithm is just the usual (0|0)(1|0) contribution.
Many other sectors have been recently computed in [73], to where we refer the reader for
more details on the match between transseries and matrix-integrals nonperturbative data.
Double-Scaling Limit:
In order to reach minimal-string or JT-gravity formulae, the above
(oﬀ-critical) matrix model results have to be double-scaled (e.g., see the recent discussions in
[50]). In practice one starts from a one-cut multi-pinched spectral curve—as in (3.2) with s = 1
or, equivalently, as in (3.7)—and zooms-in on the endpoint of the cut a1, eﬀectively producing a
single cut along C = (−∞, a1] (compare with formula (3.4)). On what concerns nonperturbative
sectors, this procedure was described in [50, 73] but which we next brieﬂy recall. Starting from
the one-cut setting, introduce a scaling parameter ε and take26
a1 →adsl,
a2 →adsl −ε,
(3.19)
M(x) →Mdsl(x)
√ε
,
M′(x) →M′
dsl(x)
√ε
,
(3.20)
in the limit ε →+∞. As we only address double-scaled quantities from now on, we drop the
“dsl” labeling of all quantities. This leads to the multi-pinched double-scaled spectral curve
y(x) = M(x)
√
x −a,
(3.21)
with k pinches—which we take located at x⋆
n with n = 1, . . . , k.
Consider the free energy which is computed from that spectral curve27 where gs is the ex-
pansion parameter now in the double-scaled theory. Focus on the nonperturbative contributions
to that free-energy when only one pinch, say, x⋆
1, of the spectral curve (3.21) is populated. These
are transseries sectors of the type (n1, m1, 0, . . . , 0) which will be associated to (anti) eigenvalue
conﬁgurations of the type (ℓ1|¯ℓ1)(0|¯0) · · · (0|¯0), with some pre-factor of Borel residues that de-
pends strongly on the resurgent path under consideration (as outlined above). But even if the
Borel residues (resurgent path) that one has to employ in order to arrive at a resurgent sector
changes, the (anti) eigenvalue conﬁguration associated to the sector will not change—we are still
computing the same nonperturbative contributions, just with diﬀerent Borel residues attached
to it. What this eﬀectively implies is that for all practical purposes this case may be treated as if
26This scaling is simple: the one-cut double-scaled curve y(x) = M(x)√x −a on C = (−∞, a] may be rewritten
as on a ﬁnite-cut Cﬁnite = [a −ε, a] by replacing x with x + (x−a)2
ε
. The limit ε →+∞then recovers Cﬁnite →C .
27This free energy may be computed from the spectral curve for example via the topological recursion [89].

use the results therein in the following. These results yield the double-scaled formulae that we
present below, where we will keep the single-pinch labeling of [73] for simplicity of notation.
Nonperturbative contributions from the saddle x⋆

Notice how this contribution has no associated exponential transmonomials, as the resonant
actions annihilate each other. Still, this is a nonperturbative contribution; see, e.g., [68, 70, 72,

Note that we are here computing a special combination of partition-function ratios. That this
combination is the interesting one to consider is related to the very special resonant structure
that spectral curves of the type (3.21) inherently possess. Further details can be found in [73]
and we will get back to this in the upcoming subsection 3.2 .
Having understood the case where just one of the pinches (herein x⋆
1) is populated, let us next
move-on to also populate a second pinch, say x⋆

(2, 2k −1) Minimal Strings: BCFT Matches the Matrix Model
Let us now use the double-scaled one-matrix model results derived above and apply them to
the (2, 2k −1) minimal-string spectral curve (3.4). When comparing minimal-string and (double
scaled) matrix-model results, it is well known how tunneled eigenvalues correspond to ZZ-branes;
e.g., [42, 54, 49, 55, 56, 58, 62, 60]. What we can now establish by direct comparison is that the
tunneled anti-eigenvalues in [73] correspond to the negative-tension ZZ-branes proposed in sec-
tion 2. This is established by comparing BCFT results for diﬀerent free-energy nonperturbative
sectors from section 2 against our present double-scaled matrix-model formulae.
We start by spelling out formulae (3.22)-(3.23)-(3.24)-(3.25)-(3.26) for the speciﬁc case of
the (2, 2k −1) minimal string. The instanton action reads28 [49, 56]

Besides the minus-sign diﬀerence which has already been addressed in footnote 13, notice the
diﬀerence of a factor of 2 to the action computed from BCFT in formula (2.39). This factor
goes back to the the fact that the BCFT calculation considers full cycles on the moduli space
of FZZT branes while the matrix model and string equation calculations work with half cycles.
Upon comparison of the various results this factor needs to be taken into account29. Furthermore
a useful identity to use is

Once again this result precisely matches its BCFT counterpart in (2.67) (once one correctly
adjusts a factor of 2 for every occurrence of the action in the above formula). Last but not least
the same holds for the (1|1)(1|0) contribution. For the saddle-points x⋆

Indeed this result also perfectly matches the corresponding BCFT calculation given in (2.71),
upon the inclusion of the familiar factor of 2 in the appropriate places. Having precisely matched
many BCFT and double-scaled matrix-model results, supports both our results and our inter-
pretation. Nonetheless, we proceed with further checks—now against string-equation results and
via numerical large-order matches.
3.3
BCFT/Matrix-Model Results Match String-Equation Results
Albeit comparison of BCFT versus matrix-model results has already established a rather non-
trivial consistency check of our proposal, let us move-on and further check our results against
string equations30. Appendix A outlines the general set-up of minimal-string string-equations,
and we refer the reader to [50] for another recent discussion precisely along the lines of the ensuing
discussion. Comparisons between matrix-model and string-equation results were also extensively
conducted in [73], as string-equations iteratively yield the complete resurgent transseries solutions
including all possible nonperturbative sectors. Further note how this “triple check” is useful also
if to go forward with calculations: while BCFT or matrix model computations at high-instanton
or high-genera are very slow, the same via string equations may be quite fast and eﬃcient.
Once the match has been established, one may then mainly rely on string equations to produce
high-instanton and high-order data, also establishing Stokes data in the process.
Let us start with a quick numerical exploration of the resonant structure of minimal strings
using string-equation data for the (p, q) = (2, 5) example. Here we check the perturbative speciﬁc-
heat up to genus 40. The explicit results are shown in ﬁgure 10 and they support how minimal
30To be fully precise, string equations really arise from matrix-model orthogonal polynomials. Hence what we
truly imply is that our earlier “matrix model” results are actually “spectral curve” or “matrix integral” results.

Figure 10: Numerical tests for the perturbative sector of the speciﬁc-heat of the (2, 5) minimal

order checks of the perturbative sector. Here A1,g = 2g
p
ug/ug+1 and RTk denotes the kth
Richardson transform [67]. We observe that, as expected from the discussion in subsection 3.1, the
leading asymptotics only “see” the instanton action A1 which in the matrix-model computations
is associated to the saddle-point closest to the cut. On the right-hand side we plot the poles of the
Borel–Pad´e approximation [67] to the perturbative speciﬁc-heat, up to genus 40. The symmetry
of the Borel singularities is evident, thus supporting that minimal strings are resonant.
strings are indeed resonant (analytically shown in [50]). Notice how the asymptotic checks in
ﬁgure 10 only see the leading instanton action A1—and not the smaller action A2.
This is
exactly in line with the matrix-model discussion in subsection 3.1, and reﬂects how eigenvalues
cannot directly tunnel to the saddle-point x⋆
2 (note how moving between free-energy and speciﬁc-
heat via double-integration preserves the instanton actions and the Borel residues up to global
rescaling—as such, matrix-model free-energy features also reﬂect in the speciﬁc-heat).
We now focus on the (1, 1) sector at leading-order in genus. It turns out that this con-
tribution may be obtained analytically for arbitrary k from direct use of the minimal-string
string-equations. In appendix A we derive the formula for the lowest-genus contribution to the
(1, 1) sector of the string speciﬁc-heat, which is given explicitly in formula (A.15) for the mul-
ticritical hierarchy and in (A.17) for the minimal-string hierarchy. Then, recalling the “bridge”
relation, our results can be written in terms of free energy via simple exponentiation as [73]
S(0,0)→(0,1) S(0,1)→(1,1)
Z(1,1)(gs)
Z(0,0)(gs) =
(3.34)
= S(0,0)→(0,1) S(0,1)→(1,1)

o
,
and all that remains to be done is translate the prediction of (3.31) from free energy F to speciﬁc
heat u. We do so by recalling the relation31
g2
s F ′′(z) = −1
2u(z).
(3.35)
31Herein we are focusing on the string-equation variable z-dependence, see appendix A.
– 36 –

Thus, noting that at lowest genus only the (1, 1) free-energy sector contributes, it turns out that
the factors of π cancel on both sides due to the insertion of Borel residues, and the prediction
can be restated as the condition that (A.17) satisﬁes
u(1,1)
0,MS-k(z) = 2A′′(z).
(3.36)
The simplicity of this formula is surprising at ﬁrst sight, given the complicated structure of
u(1,1)
0,MS-k(z). However, below we will show that the two expressions exactly coincide for all k.
Firstly, one needs to use prior results obtained in [50], which we have explicitly included in
the appendix A. Then, diﬀerentiating (A.13) we can solve for A′′(z) to ﬁnd
2A′′(z) = −

(3.37)
In fact we are almost done: ﬁrst we note that by solving the kth minimal-string string-equation
at lowest genus, one can ﬁnd u′
0(z) as
u′
0(z) =

.
(3.38)
We immediately recognize this factor as the denominator of u(1,1)
0,MS-k(z) in (A.17).
Further,
we recognize the denominator of the expression for A′′(z) above to be precisely32 u(1,0)
0,MS-k(z) ×
u(0,1)
0,MS-k(z) = u(1,0)
0,MS-k(z)2. Finally, upon relabelling the sum appearing in the numerator of (3.37)
as ℓ→k −2p, one sees that this term precisely matches the double-sum in the numerator of
(A.17); the ﬁrst of which is associated to the minimal string KdV times, and the second belonging
to the “multicritical factors” u(1,1)
0,MC-k(z) given in (A.15). All of the above ingredients add up so
as to precisely produce (3.37) above, thus demonstrating the equality in (3.36).
Let us perform another check, albeit less analytic, for the results for the (2, 0) sector. In
particular, we now wish to verify formula (3.29) for ℓ= 2 against string equation results. Notice
that the starting genus for that equation is in fact of order g2
s . In other words, at order gs the
right-hand side of this equation should equal zero and, translating to free energies, this formula
actually tells us that the lowest contributions should cancel. Therefore, at order gs we ﬁnd

To check the validity of this result directly from the string equation, we again ﬁrst translate the
above to a statement for the speciﬁc heat as

0,MS-k(z) =

u(1,0)
0,MS-k(z)
A′(z)


2
.
(3.40)
32Due to the backward-forward relations discussed in [77], these two sectors are in fact the same at lowest genus.
– 37 –

This equality may be shown to hold for all k, directly from the (A.6) (1, 0) and (A.16) (2, 0)
lowest-genus coeﬃcients. In fact, a factor of

u(1,0)
0,MS-k(z)

already appears implicitly in equation
(A.16) for the (2, 0) sector, and it is then straightforward to see that the remaining terms precisely
reproduce (A.13), the deﬁning equation for A′(z) in terms of the perturbative coeﬃcient u0(z).
Since this is an easier calculation than the one performed for the (1, 1) sector above, and as it is
not particularly illuminating, we omit the details. Instead, we proceed to verify (3.29)-(3.39) at
next-to-leading order in gs. In full generality this would require generic higher-order coeﬃcients
in the (2, 0) and (1, 0) sectors which are not available as expressions for arbitrary k. Nonetheless,
we can of course make explicit checks at various ﬁxed values of k. First evaluate (3.29) with

To make the comparison with the string equations, all we have left to do is relate the free-energy
coeﬃcients to those of the speciﬁc heat. Similarly to what was done in [50] for the lowest two
orders in gs, we ﬁnd that these free energy sectors can be rewritten as

As already mentioned, a check at arbitrary k requires closed-forms for
the coeﬃcients u(2,0)
1,MS-k(z) and u(1,0)
1,MS-k(z), which would in turn need more knowledge than we
currently have concerning the coeﬃcients of the Gel’fand–Dikii polynomials (see appendix A for
a more detailed explanation). However, we can of course still check this explicitly for several
values of k. We have done so for k = 2, 3, 4, 5 and we obtained precise agreements between the
above equations (3.41) and (3.42). Alongside the earlier arbitrary-k check on the order-gs (2, 0)
and (0, 2) sectors (the latter being given by the former via backward forward symmetry; see for
example [77]) and order-g−1
s
(1, 1) sector, we now have very compelling evidence for the validity
of the BCFT and matrix-integral results fully matching against string-equation results.
Finally, let us check the above double-scaled matrix-model results against the string-equation
transseries for (p, q) = (2, 5) (discussed in appendix B). For the following comparison we will not
ﬁx to the conformal background, so as to understand how the matrix model computation actually

The Case of Jackiw–Teitelboim Gravity
The (2, 2k −1) minimal-string series has a well-deﬁned k →+∞limit which has seen great
interest in recent years: this is the double-scaled matrix model [88] describing quantum JT-
gravity [82–87]. At strict nonperturbative level, this limit was recently addressed in [50], and
the resurgent asymptotics of JT gravity studied in detail in [95]—at least on what concerns the
non-resonant part of the JT transseries. What we can now add, given our present results, is
what happens at nonperturbative resonant level. For that, we just apply our earlier machinery
to the JT-gravity double-scaled spectral curve [134, 88],
y(x) = 1
2π sin
 2π√x

.
(3.50)
Note how running the topological recursion on this JT spectral curve is quite straightforward,
e.g., [88, 50, 95]. The same holds true for our nonperturbative resurgent formulae. The zeros
of this spectral curve are located at √x⋆n = ζ⋆
n = n
2 , with n ∈N+. Furthermore we ﬁnd the (to
become useful below) expressions for the moment function M′(x⋆
n) = (−1)n 2
n2 and the instanton
action (see [95] for further details)
An = (−1)n+1 n
4π2 .
(3.51)
The resonant nature of JT gravity has been established at the level of its string-equation
instanton-actions in [50]. We herein start by checking how resonance is further supported nu-
merically. For this we have performed a Borel–Pad´e approximation of the JT perturbative sector
(see, e.g., [67]) using its ﬁrst 122 coeﬃcients (and using data from [95]). The results are shown
in ﬁgure 11. A similar calculation can be performed for the one-instanton contribution, just with
much less numerical accuracy (we have used the whole 12 coeﬃcients obtained via the nonpertur-
bative topological recursion in [95] for the one-instanton sector). The result is now visualized in
ﬁgure 12. It is clear from the symmetry of the Borel singularities, alongside the instanton-action
calculations in [50], how resonance is indeed a feature of JT-gravity.
With all this evidence we are equipped to spell out the nonperturbative contributions outlined
in subsection 3.1 for the case of JT gravity. Straightforward application of our formulae to saddle

instanton singularities on the Borel plane. Symmetry of these singularities is evident.

12th order [95]. As such, the Pad´e approximants do not produce a lot of poles. In spite of this,
both symmetric instanton contributions associated to resonance are clearly visible in the plot.
In addition we have the non-trivial (2|1) contribution,

Checks on the validity of the above formulae against BCFT or string equations are essentially

non-trivial check we can do, however, is to go back to the construction of JT-gravity as the
k →+∞limit of the (2, 2k −1) minimal-string [88]. This limit received nonperturbative support
in [50], upon using the adequate rescalings of nonperturbative quantities as

Applying these rescalings and corresponding k →+∞limits to our (2, 2k −1) minimal-string
formulae from subsection 3.2—which themselves have already been triple-checked against BCFT
and string equation results—we have explicitly checked33 that they yield precise matches with
the above JT results. In this sense, at the very least our nonperturbative JT-gravity results are
fully consistent with the large k limit of the minimal string.
Finally let us ﬁx a normalization for the JT-gravity transseries, and compute Borel residues
explicitly from our above “transseries reparametrization invariant” quantities [70], using the
“bridge” relations given in [73]. For the free energy, we choose to normalize sectors around the

Towards the Two-Matrix Model?
Having focused on the one-matrix model up to this stage, and making contact with the (p, q) =
(2, 2k −1) minimal string results of section 2, we may now ask if our formulae may be extended
to the full-ﬂedged two-matrix model—hence if they may make contact with the complete (p, q)
BCFT formulae in section 2. Let us immediately warn the reader that this subsection does not
include a complete calculation, but rather a motivating set-up to build-upon in future work.
Two-Matrix Model:
Begin with the two-matrix model [136–139, 58, 140], now with partition
function

n),
but even though the computation is long it is straightforward.
– 42 –

where both matrices are hermitian N × N, and where the polynomial potentials have degrees
deg V ′
1 = d1, deg V ′
2 = d2. As for the one-matrix model, the large-N ’t Hooft limit is described
by a spectral curve, encoded in the algebraic (polynomial) equation [138, 140, 89]
E(x, y) = 0,
with
degx E = d1 + 1,
degy E = d2 + 1,
(3.64)
from where one wishes to obtain y ≡Y (x), albeit this is now a bit more subtle. Consider a point
p ∈Σ on the Riemann surface Σ described by (3.64) and the corresponding maps x = X(p) and
y = Y(p). More speciﬁcally, for ﬁxed x this geometry describes a (d2 + 1)-sheeted covering of
the complex x-plane. Label these sheets34 by i = 0, . . . , d2, and let pi(x) be the points on each
of these which project down to x via X(pi) = x. Then, (3.64) is satisﬁed with this x and the
corresponding35
yi ≡Yi(x) = Y(pi(x)).
(3.66)
There is one (unique) special sheet, the physical 0-th sheet, where36 for x →+∞
Y0(x) = V ′
1(x) −N
x + o(1/x2).
(3.67)
But moreover, we ﬁnd branch-points whenever two of the sheets of Σ meet, i.e., whenever
Yn(x) = Ym(x) (or Xn(y) = Xm(y)) for n ̸= m.
We are interested in branch-points away
from the endpoints of the cuts, i.e., in the nonperturbative saddles.
Consider one such nonperturbative saddle, labeled by (xmn, ymn). As two sheets touch, this
is a double-point of the spectral curve, and we are (at least locally) in the framework of [73]—
i.e., these are two distinct points in the uniformization cover, and as such both must be taken
into account when computing nonperturbative contributions. This is in fact considered when
computing the corresponding instanton action as in [139], where one ﬁnds
Amn =
I
Bmn
dx y =
Z ∞
xmn
dx Yn(x) −
Z ∞
xnm
dx Ym(x).
(3.68)
Herein Bmn is the B-cycle through the two points, and recall that multiple sheets meet at ∞
[139]. This set-up is illustrated in ﬁgure 13.
It is now clear how the constructions in [73] should translate to the two-matrix model case.
In spite of now ﬁnding a multitude of sheets (rather than just two), the generic structure at
the nonperturbative saddle has not changed: in fact, therein, one still ﬁnds two distinct sheets
coming together. In addition, swapping sheets eﬀectively reverses the integration direction in
(3.68) leading to an overall minus sign, and eventually to the subsequent transseries resonant
structures as computed in the one-matrix model case [73]. The diﬃculty now, of course, is making
this explicit for all possible nonperturbative saddles, which we leave for future work.
As a warm-up calculation, let us herein focus on the one-instanton contribution and its
resonant sibling.
The two-matrix model one-instanton contribution has been investigated in
34Notice that the labeling of sheets that we are using for the two-matrix model spectral curve diﬀers slightly
from the one used in section 2. Nevertheless they are consistent and related (see formula (2.32)-(2.34)).
35Equivalently, for ﬁxed y, (3.64) describes a (d1 + 1)-sheeted covering of the complex y-plane. Label these
sheets by j = 0, . . . , d1, and let epj(y) be the points on each of these which project down to y via Y(epj) = y. Then,
(3.64) is satisﬁed with this y and the corresponding
xj ≡Xj(y) = X(epj(y)).
(3.65)

2(y) −N
y + o(1/y2) for y →+∞.

Figure 13: Spectral curve of the two-matrix model with d1 = 2, d2 = 1. On the left we plot
the spectral curve via uniformization on the sphere, where the two points are identiﬁed with
each other, i.e., x12 = X(p). Their connecting B-cycles are plotted in analogy with [73], and the
diﬀerent sheets are also illustrated (either by color or by name). Swapping Y (x) physical (blue)
and non-physical (orange) sheets as in (3.68) eﬀectively corresponds to reversing the integration
direction of the cycle (recall that the integration direction which is consistent with the matrix
model is opposed to the BCFT one). More complicated conﬁgurations will have a multitude
of sheets, albeit nonperturbative saddles always lie at double-points and (at least locally) the
discussion in [73] applies. These present plots build on ﬁgures ﬁrst appearing in [139].
detail in [58]. Moreover the full double-scaled minimal-string result was computed therein and
it is consistent with the computations in this paper (e.g., compare formulae (27) and (35) in
section 4 of [58] to our formula (2.38)). Indeed the instanton action computed in [58] is exactly
of the type (3.68). Therefore we expect resonance to be a clear feature of the two-matrix model.
Furthermore let us brieﬂy investigate the chemical potential associated to the one-instanton. It
reads [58, 60]
Z(1|0)
Z(0|0) ≡Zmn

where in the ﬁrst identiﬁcation we are making contact with the notation in section 2—and
hence label nonperturbative contributions by the sheets that their B-cycles connect. Let us now
understand how the chemical potential changes when comparing an instanton to a negative-
instanton. This amounts to swapping n with m in the above (3.69). This produces a factor
of i which is exactly consistent with our results in subsection 2.2. Furthermore, it agrees with
– 44 –

the general expectation in resonant problems [70, 50, 73]. We leave a careful study of the full
two-matrix model nonperturbative contributions for future work.
(p, q) Minimal String Theory:
The double-scaled version of the previous discussion is of
course simpler, and it further matches to the (p, q) BCFT minimal string discussion in section 2,
as well as reduces to the (2, 2k−1) one-matrix model minimal-string discussion of subsection 3.2.
Recall how the relevant Riemann surface Σp,q is now genus-zero with 1
2 (p −1) (q −1) pinched
A-cycles, and is given by (3.3). These (pinched) singularities sit at [49]

with 1 ≤m ≤p −1, 1 ≤n ≤q −1, qm −pn > 0, and where ζ is the uniformization parameter.
The instanton contributions are given by integrating the spectral curve over B-cycles across these
singularities [49]
Amn =

Bmn
dx y.
(3.71)
As for the two-matrix model, swapping sheets at the pinched double-points will reverse integration
directions and produce the minus-sign which gives rise to the resonant contributions. This is
exactly our result in section 2—switching sheets will reverse the integration direction of the Bmn
cycle as underlined in subsection 2.2 (and recall that the matrix-model integration-direction is
reversed in comparison to BCFT as explained earlier).

Towards Topological and Critical String Theories
Having understood how negative-tension D-branes are an unavoidable part of minimal string
theory—in fact being required by resurgence—the next question is how ubiquitous may they
be across generic string theoretic backgrounds.
In this section we begin the study of more
intricate models, in topological and critical string theory. The results we report upon are not as
exhaustive as in the minimal string example (due to the natural computational intricacies) but
we nonetheless believe they amount to very clear and supporting evidence. Further work along
these directions will be reported in the near future. On the topological string theory side, we
focus upon one of the simplest toric Calabi–Yau geometries, the local curve [61]. This model may
be solved with matrix-model methods and it hence builds upon [73] and our earlier section 3.
On the string theory side, we focus on D-branes in AdS, in particular the case of AdS3 where
BCFT methods come of help via the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence [91–93] mapping the present
computation to the Liouville analysis of section 2. In particular, we address the analogous to the
Liouville ZZ-calculations now for the case of discrete AdS2 D-branes inside AdS3 [18].

On Topological Strings on Toric Calabi–Yau Geometries
Let us begin with topological string theory. It is a famous result that B-model topological strings
on certain local Calabi–Yau backgrounds (the resolved p = 2 local curve, more below) are equally
described by hermitian matrix models [141]. This is to say that they are described at resurgent,
nonperturbative level by the results in [73] and section 3 herein. It is a fascinating story that
this idea applies to more general toric Calabi–Yau geometries, in particular to toric varieties
with enumerative geometry content—where making use of the topological recursion [89] on the
– 45 –

mirror curve37 of the toric variety remarkably yields38 the complete B-model topological-string
perturbative free-energy expansion, anywhere in moduli space [61, 90] (in fact yielding both open-
and closed-string B-model amplitudes).
This further stands as an alternative computational
procedure to the holomorphic anomaly equations [142], free from any such ambiguities. Now,
one clear feature of the results in [73] alongside our matrix-model results in section 3 is that they
only depend upon large N spectral-curve data. As such, they may also be (adequately) applied
to a mirror curve and hence describe the resonant and resurgent nonperturbative content of these
backgrounds [62]. The one caveat is that our results only apply to one-cut models. Eﬀectively,
this reduces our range of topological string examples to local curves.
The local curve Xp is a (family of) non-compact toric Calabi–Yau threefold described by the
total space of a complex ﬁber bundle over a sphere (a direct sum of two line bundles; see, e.g.,
[131] for a review)
Xp = O(p −2) ⊕O(−p) →P1.
(4.1)
It is labeled by a single integer p ∈Z, but as unchanged by −p ↔p −2 one may restrict to
p ∈N. When p = 1 this is the resolved conifold geometry [143, 144]. When p = 2 we obtain
the aforementioned Dijkgraaf–Vafa geometries O(0) ⊕O(−2) →P1 related to hermitian matrix
models [141]. Herein we will explicitly use the non-trivial example of p = 3. The free energies
of A-model topological strings on Xp were set-up in [145], and—albeit mirror symmetry in these
geometries is subtle—a B-model-like computation was also set-up in this reference. Topological
string amplitudes on this background have familiar (phase transition) singularities, but which
are now in the c = 0 critical class [145] (where its associated double-scaled Painlev´e I equation
was addressed in our present context in [73]) rather than the usual conifold c = 1 class [143].
The B-model-like computation of [145] was revisited in [62, 121] and we will use the data
computed therein (and refer the reader to those references for further details). This computation
ﬁrst yields the topological-string genus-g free-energies on Xp as Fg ≡Fg(ξ), where ξ is a mirror-
like coordinate relating to the K¨ahler parameter t (the size of the P1) via the mirror map39
e−t = ξ (1 −ξ)p(p−2) .
(4.2)
As already mentioned, one may also compute free energies for toric geometries using the topo-
logical recursion [89] on the appropriate curve—in this case on the mirror curve [61, 90]. For the
example we are interested in, it turns out that the curve will still be of the form (3.2) albeit now
with non-polynomial moment function. More speciﬁcally, for the local curve one ﬁnds [61, 90]
(similar-looking spectral curves also hold for other toric mirrors)

in which parametrization we can indeed apply the usual recursion [89]. Herein, the endpoints of

b =
 1 + √ξ

(1 −ξ)p .
(4.4)
37Recall how the mirror geometry to a toric Calabi–Yau threefold is essentially captured by a Riemann surface.
38There is one subtlety: this is not a verbatim application of the topological recursion, as the mirror curve lives
in C∗× C∗rather than C × C; see [90] for details on the required meromorphic-diﬀerential modiﬁcation.
39A word on conventions: the mirror-like coordinate w in [145, 121] relates to ξ in [61, 62] as w = 1 −ξ.

The nonperturbative study of topological strings on this background was initiated in [61] and
then continued in [62, 121]. Nonperturbative saddles sit at the zeroes of the moment function,
which for the explicit p = 3 example yields

p = 3.

This leads to its corresponding instanton action, albeit the expression is now very lengthy [61].

The instanton action ﬁnally follows from the usual “diﬀerence of holomorphic eﬀective potentials”
as
A(ξ) = F(x⋆) −F(a).
(4.9)
For the explicit example of p = 3, the instanton-action alongside one- and two-loop coeﬃ-
cients around the one-instanton sector were tested against large-order behavior in [62]. Let us
now brieﬂy expand on these. Such tests are carried out in the B-model but use the computa-
tion of the free-energy coeﬃcients which is obtained from A-model data following [145, 61, 121].
This A-model computation is based on the knowledge of high-degree Gromov–Witten invariants
and is therefore limited in its computational capacity. Herein we have computed the ﬁrst 18
perturbative free-energy coeﬃcients. The results of the corresponding Borel–Pad´e analysis are
visualized in ﬁgure 14 and they perfectly support the resonance hypothesis for the local curve.
On top of these tests, we can now directly use the matrix model results of [73], as well as our
section 3, in order to compute several transseries sectors for the free energy of the topological
string on the local curve Xp (we shall occasionally specialize to the case p = 3, where we can
evaluate the saddle x⋆explicitly in a simple form). As usual we begin with the (ℓ|0) sector.
Curiously, even though the moment-function has a complicated functional form, its derivative
evaluated on the saddle x⋆simpliﬁes considerably as
M′(x⋆) =

ξ = 0.24 while the lower one was plotted at ξ = 0.15. The data points are shown in blue while
the theoretical prediction for the resonant instanton actions is visualized in red. The inherent
symmetry of Borel singularities in the plots fully supports our hypothesis of resonance.

One a priori clue that the results we just described were somehow bound to work, at least
on what concerns the existence of negative-tension toric D-branes for the local curve, is that in
the adequate double-scaling limit these D-branes become c = 0 FZZT-branes [61]. On top of
this, either matrix model [62] or local curve [61, 62] instanton actions are given by diﬀerences of
holomorphic eﬀective potentials, which is very much the same spirit in which ZZ-brane instantons
are written as diﬀerences of FZZT branes (2.15) [8, 80] (and this was further discussed from the
point-of-view of toric D-branes in [62]). It hence should come as no surprise that our earlier
Liouville results in section 2 have uplifted to topological strings on a toric Calabi–Yau.
Let us make this explicit in the following (also serving as a double-check on our formulae
above). The c = 0 critical point is of course fully described by the Painlev´e I two-parameter
resurgent transseries which has been greatly studied in the literature [68, 70, 72, 77, 73]. The
aforementioned double-scaling of the local curve has been addressed at the level of the per-
turbative free energies and instanton action in [145, 61] and we shall now do this at full (two
parameter) transseries level. Our ﬁrst observation is the (relative) simplicity of the above local-
curve transseries-sectors. For instance, note how the inverse hyperbolic tangent function does not
seem to play any relevant role at transseries level, whereas it is very much present in the moment
function in (4.3). This will somehow conspire so as to make the upcomning double-scaling limit
quite straightforward even at full nonperturbative level. In the conventions41 of [61, 70], the
Painlev´e I equation is given by
u2(z) −1
6u′′(z) = z.
(4.18)
Let us now establish a strong consistency test on the local-curve results via double-scaling to the
Painlev´e I transseries data (for example, see section 5 of [70]). Following directly the setup in
[145, 61], we write the local curve modulus ξ in terms of the Painlev´e I variable as
ξ = ξcrit −
 
4 (1 −ξcrit)3 g2
s z5/2
(p −1)8
! 1

(4.19)
with ξcrit =
1
(p−1)2 . As explained in [61], the double-scaling limit of the local-curve at criticality
is obtained for p > 2, by taking gs →0 and ξ →ξcrit while keeping z ﬁxed. Choosing p = 3, let
us ﬁrst make this calculation very explicit for our results of the (ℓ|0) sectors in (4.12). Writing
41Up to diﬀerences in conventions, this is almost the result of setting k = 2 in our results of section 3; but see
[77] for full details on the diﬀerent conventions at play.

once again in precise agreement with the expected results one obtains by substituting Painlev´e I
data from [70] into the double-scaled matrix models in [73]. All these checks amount to rather
strong motivation on the correctness of all our above topological-string expressions and their
nonperturbative materialization for the local curve.
Having obtained the nonperturbative free energy for topological string theory on the local
curve, we may ask about its enumerative-geometry content. On this regard, a relation between
Stokes data and nonperturbative enumerative-invariants of toric Calabi–Yau geometries via topo-
logical strings was recently established in [123]—and which we very brieﬂy follow next. Consider
the A-model genus-g free energies written in the ﬂat coordinate T, as Fg ≡Fg(T), and where T
42The calculation at lowest genus is eﬀectively just the instanton-action, which to some extent had already been
checked to double-scale correctly in [145, 61].

is now chosen43 so that the Painlev´e I c = 0 critical point is located at T = 0. Mapping the free
energies back from the B-model via (4.2), this then simply amounts to a shift of the standard
K¨ahler parameter t by [145]
tc = log

(p (p −2))p(2−p) (p −1)2(p−1)2
.
(4.25)
In this frame, and much like in [123], the perturbative local-curve free-energies split as
Fg(T) = F sing

(4.26)
Herein, the singular piece—which was the familiar conifold contribution [143] in [123]—is now
the “A-model version of Painlev´e I”. It is an expansion in both integer and half-integer powers
of T = t −tc, and where the usual gap-condition is of course not present: instead all negative
(half-integer) powers are present up to −5

The interest of [123] is in Stokes data which is purely associated to the regular parts of these
free energies (e.g., herein the singular-part Stokes data are the Painlev´e I Stokes data which were
already obtained in [77]). These Stokes data (eventually relating to nonperturbative enumerative
invariants of the local curve) should then follow by applying the same procedure as above to our
diverse new transseries sectors. In this exact same fashion, we then ﬁnd, for instance,

It would be very interesting to address the complete resurgence of the local curve, and the relation
of its Stokes data to enumerative geometry in future work.
One question we will have to address in future work is whether the above results for the
local curve will uphold when considering more complicated toric geometries—to start-oﬀwith,
the canonical topological-string examples of local P2 and local P1 × P1 (with a single and with
two K¨ahler parameters, respectively). As for the local curve described above, these backgrounds
also lead to spectral geometries of the type (3.2), with non-polynomial moment functions, but
geometries which are now intrinsically two-cut conﬁgurations [61, 90] (i.e., the mirror curve has
genus one). Borel singularities of the perturbative series for local P2 have actually been much
addressed in the literature, with numerical plots to be found in, e.g., [118, 122–125]. All these
instances clearly illustrate the hallmark of resonance with the existence of symmetrically reﬂected
Borel singularities. There is less evidence for local P1 × P1, but for the interesting analysis in
[110] pertaining to its large N dual, ABJM gauge theory on S3 [105]—more precisely, the Chern–
Simons matrix model on the lens space S3/Z2 [107, 108]. It was shown in [109, 110] via large-order
analysis of the Borel singularities of the ABJM perturbative series that they always appear in
symmetric pairs. This was explicitly shown to be true at the relevant diﬀerent points in moduli
space (orbifold, conifold, large-radius), with instanton actions again always arising in symmetric
pairs [110]. This is another distinct appearance of our by-now familiar hallmark of resonance.
All evidence considered certainly begs for an extensive analysis of these models in future work.
Recall that the ABJM partition function on S3 computes the type IIA string theory partition
function on AdS4×CP3 [105]. Rather interestingly, Chern–Simons matrix-model instantons were
identiﬁed in [110] as dual type IIA D2-branes wrapping an RP3 inside the CP3. In light of this,
one is immediately led to ask if our resurgence negative-tension D-brane results may be in any
way directly addressed for critical strings in an AdS background. This is what we shall turn to
next, in the context of D-branes in AdS3.
4.2
On Critical Strings and Negative-Tension D-Branes in AdS
One string-theoretic example of a curved background where D-branes have been much studied
is that of D-branes in AdS3 [13]. Perhaps the most studied D-branes in this background have
been AdS2 D-branes, but there are other types [14–19]. Attempting a direct BCFT calculation
in AdS3 would of course take us far from the main line of this paper, but there is a remarkable
correspondence between euclidean AdS3 (usually denoted by H+
3 ) and Liouville (B)CFT’s [91–93]
which allows for direct contact with our analysis in section 2. This is usually known as the H+
3 –
Liouville correspondence. In particular, we are interested in the results of [18], mapping D-branes
in AdS3 to D-branes in Liouville theory. Roughly speaking, therein FZZT branes correspond to
AdS2 D-branes and ZZ branes correspond to “discrete” AdS2 D-branes—which then allows us
to translate the AdS discussion back to our results in section 2 and hence, focusing on ZZ-like or
“discrete” AdS2 D-branes, infer on the existence of negative-tension D-branes in AdS3.

Consider (bosonic) string theory on (euclidean) AdS3. The metric is taken in Poincar´e-type

alongside some compact manifold CFT44 and bc reparametrization ghosts. Herein, φ is a free
boson with background charge and the bosonic βγ-system alone has central charge 2. At level
k + 2 (relating to the AdS3 radius as R2 = k + 2) the AdS3 CFT central charge is
cAdS3 = 3 + 6
k.
(4.37)
Moving towards D-branes, in particular euclidean AdS2 D-branes (see below), one ﬁnds the extra
boundary term in the AdS3 action [147]
SAdS3,B[φ, β] = µ

(4.38)
The AdS2 D-branes we are interested in are most evident in the “AdS coordinates” of [14],
with metric description
g = R2  dψ ⊗dψ + cosh2 ψ
 dω ⊗dω −cosh2 ω dτ ⊗dτ

.
(4.39)
AdS2 D-branes (deﬁned via the twined conjugacy classes of SL(2, R) [14]) are the AdS2 leaves of
the constant ψ = ψ foliation of AdS3, i.e., they slice AdS3 in terms of ﬁxed radius AdS2 leaves
at ﬁxed ψ. They are hence labeled by a single real parameter ψ ∈R, and have varying radius
ρAdS2 = RAdS3 cosh ψ. Denote them by
|ψ⟩AdS2 .
(4.40)
As we discuss next, these D-branes are essentially the Liouville FZZT D-branes [18, 92, 147].
Remarkably [91, 93] arbitrary correlation functions in the H+
3 CFT may be simply written
in terms of Liouville CFT correlation functions, on surfaces of arbitrary genus. This correspon-
dence is extendable to correlation functions on the disk with AdS2 D-brane boundary conditions,
now rewritten in terms of Liouville BCFT correlation functions with FZZT D-brane boundary
conditions [92]. The bulk H+
3 –Liouville correspondence identiﬁes the H+
3 level k + 2 with the
Liouville coupling b as
b2 = 1
k,
(4.41)
44For example, in this bosonic-string setting we could consider the compact manifold to be a WZW three-sphere
alongside an adequate torus; say: H+
3,k+2 ⊕SU(2)k−2 ⊕20 free bosons ⊕bc with vanishing total central charge.

(4.43)
Now, as we already reviewed in (2.15), Liouville ZZ-branes may be constructed as diﬀerences
of FZZT-branes [8, 80]. Having a map (4.43) between FZZT and AdS2 D-branes, naturally led
[18] to construct discrete ZZ-like AdS2 D-branes from diﬀerences of standard (4.40) AdS2 D-
branes—building on the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence and in complete analogy with ZZ-branes
in (2.15). These discrete D-instantons are deﬁned and denoted by48

with n, m ∈N [18]. Note that this discrete set of D-branes lives in the analytic continuation
of AdS3 according to (4.39).
It is now immediate to further consider their negative-tension
counterparts in full analogy with what was earlier done for Liouville D-branes in section 2.
First recall from section 2 how resonance arises in minimal string theory as a consequence of
the switching of sheets in the FZZT moduli space, which, at the level of ZZ-branes, amounts
to exchanging n with −n as in formulae (2.33)-(2.34). In this spirit, we are led to conjecture

A complete, explicit treatment of such nonperturbtive contributions is quite complicated and
outside the scope of this paper, but we can nevertheless perform some calculations in this direction
which give clear support to our proposal and the resonant resurgence hypothesis. We start with
the empty disk which was computed in [18] for standard D-branes, and which is then immediate
to extend to negative-branes as
⟨0|m, n⟩AdS2 = +21/4 (−1)m+1 p
8πb Γ (1 −b2) Γ (1 + b2) sin nπb2,
(4.46)
45The reader should not be mislead to wonder if this “opposite” has anything to do with negative-tension D-
branes in Liouville theory—it does not. Recall from section 2 that standard and negative D-branes share the same
value of µB, as x in (2.7) is the same for both. The “opposite” simply adds a ± in front of (4.42), but because
this is irrelevant for our argument we choose to simply work with the positive sign everywhere below.
46A word on conventions: in section 2 we followed the minimal string conventions of [49, 81] for the Liouville
bulk/boundary cosmological constants. Herein, to follow standard notation in the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence,
it is convenient to undo such conventions and revert back to the original Liouville bulk/boundary cosmological
constants present in (2.1)-(2.5). Eﬀectively this gives rise to the term sin πb2 in the following equation.
47Reverting Liouville bulk/boundary cosmological constant conventions as mentioned in the previous footnote
changes (2.7) to µB
√µ
√
sin πb2 = Tp(ζ), in which case the ensuing equation immediately follows.
48At this stage one might recall how ZZ-branes are located at the pinches of the spectral curve as in (2.17).
Herein, it is interesting to notice that, from an AdS3 perspective, the discrete AdS2 D-branes are associated with
leaves of (symmetrically alternating) radii ρAdS2 (m, n) = RAdS3 (−1)m+1 sin nπb2.

where clearly a resonant structure is emerging by construction. Indeed, we do ﬁnd an extra (at
ﬁrst seemingly harmless) minus-sign exactly as we did in section 2, say in (2.42) or (2.43). Of
course the main point of section 2 was to show how this innocent minus-sign can indeed lead to
very non-trivial consequences, due to its appearance in the argument of the exponential terms
sitting inside the integrals over D-brane moduli space—the reader may recall the comparison
between (2.49) and (2.56). As such, our goal in the present subsection is to show how a similar
eﬀect also occurs for the above (negative) discrete AdS2 D-branes (albeit this time around there
is no “matrix model” calculation to check the resulting transseries structure against).
The next step in this reasoning is to compute string-theoretic annulus amplitudes for (nega-
tive) discrete AdS2 D-branes. This yields information on the nature of the interactions between,
say, two discrete AdS2 D-branes or a discrete AdS2 D-brane with its negative-tension counterpart.
Let us do this calculation following our strategy in section 2; in particular by making manifest
the diﬀerent nature of the interaction between two D-branes versus the interaction between a
D-brane and its negative-tension sibling, as in (2.49) versus (2.56). First focus on the (2, 0)
nonperturbative sector. Via the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence one can write the contribution of
two discrete AdS2 branes in terms of a double-integral over the moduli space of AdS2 branes—as
in the Liouville counterpart (2.49). But in order to herein apply (2.49) a slight modiﬁcation is
however required. Recall how in section 2 swapping sheets was related to switching the sign of
m in |m, n⟩ZZ. In the present AdS construction [18], however, it is swapping the sign of n in
|m, n⟩AdS2 which is employed to construct discrete AdS2 branes. To be directly consistent with
this choice let us now choose to foliate the Liouville surface with q sheets instead of p. Speciﬁ-
cally, in (2.49) we used αβ to label the p sheets of the minimal-string FZZT moduli-space, but we
could equally have described the same surface using q sheets—now given by the map y = Tq(ζ)
(recall (2.7)-(2.8)). As explained, this is what we will do from now on for the Liouville side, and
hence use α, β ∈{0, . . . , q −1}. Then, the H+
3 –Liouville correspondence replaces

and where the disk and annulus amplitudes are AAdS3

(ψ) = ⟨0|ψ⟩and AAdS3

(ψ, ˜ψ) = ⟨ψ| ˜ψ⟩.
Notice how the q sheets of the FZZT moduli space (in the language of section 2, where the
Liouville surface was foliated with p sheets, these were made explicit in (2.12)) are now translated
to the q values of the AdS2 modulus in (4.50), once we identify Liouville and AdS data as in (4.43).
Further notice how a shift of ψ by 2πib2 α corresponds to a switching of sheets in the Liouville
analogue of section 2, as follows from (4.44)-(4.45). Then, further including compact-manifold
matter and bc ghost contributions (dropping the AdS3 CFT superscript, and keeping the AdS2
BCFT label implicit as this is our only relevant boundary condition in full string theory) the
string-theoretic (2, 0)-sector becomes (compare with (2.49))

We can check that upon localization on the saddle-points of the integral, the leading contribution
from (4.51) indeed reproduces the instanton action (4.46) (up to the expected factor of 2). Namely
setting the derivative of (4.52) to zero we arrive at the condition49

(4.55)
The above condition is exactly solved by the moduli which give rise to the discrete ZZ-like
branes in (4.44). However, in order to perform the saddle-point integration to higher orders
an explicit and regularized expression for the annulus amplitude is required (which at Liouville
level is essentially our discussion in subsection 2.1). Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge,
regularized AdS annuli have not been addressed in the literature: from the standpoint of the H+
3 –
Liouville correspondence, the map has only been properly established for disk amplitudes [92];
and when directly addressing euclidean AdS2 D-branes in AdS3, the relevant annulus amplitude
may be found in [17], but only the unregularized version of this amplitude—which still prevents
us from moving to next order. Nevertheless, for our purposes in the present subsection it turns
out that leaving the result unintegrated, as in (4.51), suﬃces.
Let us compare the (2, 0) contribution in (4.51) with the (1, 1) contribution which would
result from the interaction of a discrete AdS2 D-brane with its negative-tension counterpart.
Following the exact same procedure as above we now ﬁnd the integral (compare with (2.56))

This implies that, in complete analogy with the Liouville calculation, the present (1, 1) contri-
bution diﬀers from the (2, 0) calculation by two minus signs. The ﬁrst one is almost harmless,
and it can be found in front of the instanton action; whereas the second one is non-trivial: it sits
49We are leaving some details under the rug. Indeed, there are two common ways of labeling operators in AdS3,
and the H+
3 –Liouville map is formulated in the Laplace-transformed basis often labeled by µ (unrelated to Liouville
µ). It is in this basis which the calculation is usually done. On the other hand, the disk amplitudes (4.46)-(4.47)
were written in the physical x basis for convenience. Indeed, for these empty disks all x dependence drops out
which is consistent with their correspondence to instanton actions.
50This should come without surprise as it is a purely diagrammatic statement. It is likely generic.

inside the exponential in the integrand and will produce inverse integrand-terms upon compar-
ison between (2, 0) and (1, 1) contributions—hence rather distinct ﬁnal amplitudes (this is the
same overall discussion as in section 2 and we need not repeat it). We hope to come back to this
calculation in the near future, to make it as explicit as in the Liouville/minimal-string case.
The above reasoning supports the existence of negative-tension D-instantons in AdS3, but it
is by no means an absolute proof and further work is required. Going forward, one interesting
point we have not discussed is the analogue extension of our Liouville BCFT analysis in section 2
to a direct AdS3 BCFT analysis following [15–17]. It should be possible to compute both disk
and annulus amplitudes involving negative-tension D-branes in AdS3 and hence further build
upon our discussion above—and this would also be very interesting future research. Such would-
be negative-tension results could further have interesting applications, most notably due to the
relation of the AdS3 CFT to two- and three-dimensional black holes, as well as to the near-horizon
geometry of NS5-branes. Another closely related future research venue would be to extend our
results to the settings of [148, 19] which are also in close Liouville proximity.

A
On General Minimal-String String-Equations
This appendix includes some generalities alongside some new results concerning minimal-string
string-equations, which are used for checks of our BCFT and matrix-model results in the main
body to the text. We refer the reader to the discussion in [50] (which we will partially follow
upon next) for further details and for a compete list of the relevant references.

The Gel’fand–Dikii KdV potentials Rk [u] are polynomials in the speciﬁc-heat u(z) as well as its

2. The hierarchy of minimal-string string-equations are
non-linear ordinary diﬀerential equations in z, which, at the end-of-the-day, must still be tuned
to the conformal background [48, 49] so that the speciﬁc-heat is dependent only upon the string
coupling, u ≡u(gs). Although we are mainly interested in this minimal-string hierarchy, it will
prove useful to consider the multicritical hierarchy as a basis for what follows. This multicritical-
string hierarchy of equations is simpler, as [33–37]
(−1)k
2k+1 k!
(2k −1)!! Rk [u(z)] = z.
(A.5)
In the main body of the paper we are interested in understanding the generic (2, 2k −1)
minimal string theory alongside its k →+∞JT-gravity limit. In principle this might come about
by writing down the generic string equation (minimal or multicritical alike) that follows from
solving (A.4). This is not so easy, since there is no known closed-form expression for an arbitrary
Gel’fand–Dikii polynomial Rk. There is, however, some work constructing partial closed-forms
for these polynomials [43, 44, 50]. It turns out that even with only partial knowledge of these
Rk, some calculations may be made yielding certain quantities in the transseries solutions to the
generic kth string equation. For example, it was obtained in [50] a closed-form expression for the
ﬁrst non-zero coeﬃcient of the one-instanton sector of the kth minimal string (MS), as

Gel’fand–Dikii Coeﬃcients:
The analysis in [50], from which the above-mentioned arbitrary-
k statement for u(1,0)
0,MS-k followed, only made use of closed-form coeﬃcients for terms in the
Gel’fand–Dikii polynomials with the following schematic structure

Herein • is an element of some index set that is summed over (see equation (3.50) of [50]). As it
turns out, however, knowledge of closed-form Gel’fand–Dikii coeﬃcients must now be extended
if we are to check the (1, 1) nonperturbative sector at arbitrary k in this paper using string
equations. Via similar methods to those in [50], and moreover by using the relation between the
Gel’fand–Dikii polynomials and the Miura–Gardner–Kruskal recurrence [149], we were able to
obtain closed-forms of all coeﬃcients of the enlarged schematic structure

Using the above formulae, we were able to extend the current predictions for the speciﬁc-heat
leading-coeﬃcients of order-k multicritical or minimal strings; which we present below. In the
main text, we will use these results to obtain a non-trivial check of matrix model and BCFT
results for the free energies. But before moving on to the new results, we recall from [50] that

Transseries Coeﬃcients:
For simplicity we begin with the multicritical theory, whose order-
k speciﬁc-heat satisﬁes the string equation (A.5). Using a two-parameter51 transseries ansatz,
alongside the newly-found closed-form Gel’fand–Dikii coeﬃcients, this allows us to write the ﬁrst
non-zero contribution to the (2, 0) sector of the kth multicritical string (MC) as
u(2,0)
0,MC-k(z) =

Note that on the right-hand side u(1,0)

0,MC-k(z). However this
will not be convenient in the following where we will use this very same equation but rather with
u(1,0)
0,MS-k(z), as in (A.6), in its right-hand side. Hence we leave it herein unspeciﬁed. In the same
fashion, the ﬁrst non-zero contribution to the (1, 1) sector of the kth multicritical string is given
by
u(1,1)

Using the above formulae it is then straightforward to immediately obtain the results we want
for the speciﬁc heat of the (2, 2k −1) minimal string, now satisfying the string equation (A.1).

Keep in mind that in (A.16) and (A.17) we are using (A.14) and (A.15) but whose latter respective
right-hand sides use lower-instanton minimal string data (and not multicritical data).
51See [50] for a more generic set-up. However, a one-parameter transseries ansatz was mainly used as there were
not enough closed-form Gel’fand–Dikii coeﬃcients available to obtain data in the “bulk” of the transseries.

On the (2, 5) Minimal-String String-Equation
Having discussed generics on minimal-string string-equations in the previous appendix A, let
us now focus on a concrete, non-trivial example. We will address the string equation for (2, 5)
minimal string theory, following upon the analysis in [50]. The string equation (A.1) becomes

(B.1)
where, at the end-of-the-day, we will need to ﬁx z = 0 in order to reach the conformal background.
The full four-parameter transseries solution to this equation will be of the form (3.9), which
we write for the speciﬁc heat as
u (z, gs, σ) =
X

σn e−(n1−m1) A1(z)
gs

(B.2)
where n = (n1, m1, n2, m2) and where the transseries sectors are given by asymptotic series with

Details of the calculation have been outlined in [50], together with the perturbative and the
one-instanton sectors. Let us therefore only list a few nonperturbative sectors herein. Recall
that for this, and at either perturbative or nonperturbative levels, it makes sense to introduce
additional variables [150, 151, 50] (implicitly encoding z-dependence in a user-friendly way for
the speciﬁc calculations; see [50]) as
