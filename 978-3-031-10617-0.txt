Modern societies are immensely permeated by technologies and thus also depen-
dent on them. Increasingly, this is also true for countries in the global South. As a 
result, questions about the interdependencies of technology and society, the possible 
mutual inﬂuences and the social governance of technology are becoming a global 
challenge. In addition, innovation cycles have become shorter and shorter, and more 
new products and services are being offered at shorter intervals. Many of these new

A Brief History of Technology Assessment 
Since the 1970s, attempts have been made under the label of “Technology Assess-
ment” (TA) to scientiﬁcally investigate the possible effects of technological inno-
vations and, based on the ﬁndings, to advise civil society and political actors in 
this regard (for an overview see, e.g. Grunwald, 2018; Vig & Paschen, 2000). From 
a scientiﬁc point of view, TA is an interdisciplinary activity that responds to the 
emergence of new scientiﬁc and technological developments, artefacts, processes, 
services, societal problems and concrete policies, and attempts to identify the possible 
effects on different areas of life. Particular emphasis is placed on unintended conse-
quences—the non-obvious is to be made visible through interdisciplinary exchange, 
often involving stakeholders and those affected, and is thus made accessible for 
evaluation. 
There is currently no generally accepted deﬁnition of TA, but the deﬁnition used 
in an international project on TA1 methods can be regarded as a sound basis: 
Technology Assessment is a scientiﬁc, interactive and communicative process which aims 
to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science 
and technology. (Bütschi et al., 2004, S. 14) 
This very general deﬁnition contains many aspects of modern TA. It goes beyond 
“classical” informing (science to policy) and acknowledges that values and interests 
inﬂuence technology development. Bringing stakeholders and the broader public on 
board through TA processes also helps open up issues to public debate and to set 
public agendas. This endeavour needs interactive settings and communicative skills 
to bridge different perspectives and disciplines. 
However, beyond a formal discussion, the mission of TA is clear: It is about 
reﬂection on technological progress, which should be used to enable a scientiﬁcally 
elaborated knowledge base for political decision-making, and social discourse on 
questions of shaping futures in an increasingly technology-dependent world. Since 
technological development is global, reﬂection on technological progress and gover-
nance needs to take a global perspective. However, a particular challenge is that the 
social embedding of global technologies can lead to regionally, culturally and socially 
different impacts. The effects of new technologies cannot be assessed independently 
of the socio-economic environments they are used in, as there are no universal deter-
ministic impacts of a speciﬁc technology. So, the particular challenge for global TA 
is to analyse global technologies, which are often uniform—with generic challenges
1 TAMI (Technology Assessment in Europe. Between Method and Impact) was a European project 
from 2002 to 2003 focussing on providing a basis for discussions on the methods and impact of 
TA. For details see: https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/projects_grun02_tami.php.

for human beings and the environment—but at the same time to appreciate their 
interdependent embeddedness in socio-cultural and socio-economic conditions. 
Another challenge is that TA is primarily an element of policy advice, and policy 
systems vary widely internationally. An example of this is provided by the different 
forms of institutionalisation of TA in Europe. Although all full-member countries 
of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment network (EPTA)2 follow the 
same, or very similar, models of parliamentary democracy, a colourful diversity of 
institutionalisation forms and preferred methods is evident. On the one hand, these 
are historically justiﬁed, but on the other, they are mostly highly functional and 
tailored to the speciﬁc parliamentary system. 
The beginnings of institutionalised TA can be located in the Ofﬁce for Technology 
Assessment (OTA) in the USA in the 1970s. In the founding law, the foundations for 
and the demands on TA were formulated in a way that can still be regarded as valid: 
To establish an Ofﬁce for Technology Assessment for the Congress as an aid in the identiﬁ-
cation and consideration of existing and probable impacts of technological application. […] 
As technology continues to change and expand rapidly, its applications are […] increasingly 
extensive, pervasive, and critical in their impact, beneﬁcial and adverse, on the natural and 
social environment. Therefore, it is essential that, to the fullest extent possible, the conse-
quences of technological applications can be anticipated, understood, and considered in 
determination of public policy on existing and emerging national problems. […] It is neces-
sary for the Congress to equip itself with new and effective means for securing competent, 
unbiased information concerning the physical, biological, economic, social, and political 
effects of such (technological) applications. (United States Senate, 1972) 
From the beginning, the need for policy advice was central: Congress wanted to 
better exercise its control function vis-à-vis the executive branch, but was increas-
ingly confronted with studies that contradicted each other and lacked decision-related 
information (see, e.g. Herdman & Jensen, 1997). The OTA relied on interdisci-
plinary, strongly scientiﬁcally oriented in-house expertise and the most compre-
hensive presentations possible. From the beginning, the OTA tried to enhance the 
readability of its reports with the help of professional scientiﬁc writers. After 23 years 
of practising TA for Congress, the OTA was closed in 1995. For a long and fruitful 
period, the OTA served as the blueprint for TA internationally. “The OTA Legacy”3 
describes the history of the OTA and presents all 700 reports. 
Soon after the founding of the OTA, the discussion about TA started in Europe. 
After lengthy discussions, several PTA institutions were established around the mid-
1980s, beginning in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, the European Parliament, 
Austria, the UK and Germany. The European Parliamentary Technology Assess-
ment (EPTA) network emerged from these foundations. The second wave occurred 
towards the end of the 1990s and a third in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century. 
Thus, EPTA now includes 25 parliamentary TA (PTA) institutions. Since the US 
Government Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO) became an associate member in 2002, 
EPTA has extended beyond Europe. This process of global networking of PTA has

continued, with the admission of members from Japan, Mexico, Chile, South Korea 
and most recently Spain and Lithuania. 
In the 50 years since the ﬁrst foundations of TA, both the social framework and the 
political conditions for parliamentarism have changed. Thus, PTA has also evolved. 
An overview of the institutionalisation of PTA and its development, especially in 
Europe, can be found in Vig and Paschen (2000), as well as Cruz-Castro and Sanz-
Menéndez (2005), and more recently in Ganzevles et al. (2014), Est et al. (2015), 
Klüver et al. (2015), Nentwich (2016), and Peissl and Grünwald (2021). 
Even though its institutional focus still lies in the area of PTA, TA has differ-
entiated, addressing governments and establishing itself in academia. A chrono-
logical sequence of different concepts and approaches to TA shows that OTA’s 
expert-oriented classical TA concept, with interdisciplinary project groups to develop 
“unbiased information” as a basis for options for action, quickly developed further 
into participatory TA, primarily in Denmark and Switzerland. Participatory TA 
(pTA) recognises the social nature of technology and thus the importance of its 
inherent values. Therefore, it includes a wide range of stakeholders and the general 
public in the TA process (Durant, 1999; Hennen, 1999; Joss & Bellucci, 2002). 
Other approaches, e.g. from the Netherlands, were particularly fruitful for academic 
discourse on the further development of TA. Constructive TA (CTA) envisages an 
active role for TA as an actor as early as possible in the technology development 
process, mainly to introduce social issues (Genus, 2006; Rip & van den Belt, 1986; 
Rip et al., 1995; Schot, 2001; Schot & Rip, 1996). The concept of real-time TA, intro-
duced in the USA in the 2000s, attempts to do something similar by early integra-
tion of social science knowledge into scientiﬁc and engineering ventures (Guston & 
Sarewitz, 2002).

Technology Assessment and Its Relatives 
In the international context, a particular success story is Health Technology Assess-
ment (HTA). HTA developed almost simultaneously from classical TA and pursues 
the same fundamental goals in terms of policy advice on an evidence basis, albeit 
restricted to medical products, interventions, therapies and preventive measures. The 
formal deﬁnition of HTA reads like this: 
HTA is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of health 
technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision-making to 
promote an equitable, efﬁcient, and high-quality health system. (O’Rourke et al., 2020) 
The specialisation in health technology made it possible to reach a consensus on 
methods and procedures and anchor them in the HTA community. An international 
community emerged early on, now represented by the International Network of 
Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), and Health Technology 
Assessment international (HTAi). INAHTA has a membership of 50 agencies with 
2100 staff from 31 countries, and HTAi has 82 member organisations, and over

5
2,500 individual members from 65 countries worldwide. A detailed history of the 
development of HTA and its organisations is described by Banta et al. (2009). 
In contrast to the precise requirements posed in HTA, the world is confronted with 
many highly complex issues, from managing and preventing conﬂicts to mitigating 
global warming, dealing with increasing inequality which threatens the social fabric 
on a global level, or new pandemics that threaten both our health and the global 
economy. In all these challenges, Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) plays 
a vital role as an essential factor in either causing or mitigating the problem. These 
challenges are severe and require rapid coordinated action on a global scale. Many 
technological developments require urgent global coordination, from digitisation to 
gene editing, nanomaterials, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and robotics. 
However, while global interaction in economic and technical terms has increased, 
we are faced with a lack of global governance. To address the global challenges and 
govern the global development of technology, it is imperative to identify, assess, 
discuss and regulate the impacts (e.g. societal, environmental, ethical or legal) of 
STI in a timely manner. As this is the main focus of Technology Assessment, TA can 
help support the global governance of technologies, ﬁnd alternatives to problematic 
applications or promote key technologies’ positive attributes. 
While similar activities exist in many areas of the world, the term “TA” is often 
unknown. These other “TA-like activities” range from research into the relationship 
between Science, Technology and Society (STS), to more project-oriented consul-
tancy in environmental issues, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 
STS research to understand and clarify the relation of science, technology and society 
splits in two basic directions—ﬁrst, scientiﬁc understanding of the nature and practice 
of S&T and, secondly, (similar to TA)—investigating more deeply into the impacts 
and control of S&T, focussing on risks and beneﬁts that might concern values such 
as peace, security, community, democracy, environmental sustainability and human 
values.4 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) has been developed and strongly 
promoted in Europe under the patronage of the European Commission. RRI takes up 
several approaches and methods of TA and aims at creating a “transparent, interactive 
process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each 
other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability 
of the innovation process and its marketable products” (von Schomberg, 2011). A 
considerable effort was made to understand the innovation process under the frame of 
RRI, and to further advance its implementation with the help of concrete criteria and 
tools through numerous European-funded projects (Owen et al., 2021). Even though 
the new European funding frameworks (e.g. Horizon Europe) have shifted focus 
towards “Open Science”, the more conceptual levels or “dimensions” of RRI remain 
relevant, including for TA. These dimensions are procedural in their approach and 
include anticipation, reﬂexivity, inclusion and responsiveness (Stilgoe et al., 2013). 
Several discussions on whether RRI is a critique of TA (van Lente et al., 2017) or  
whether TA should take on the role of a lighthouse for approaches such as RRI

(Nentwich, 2017) have taken place. Further, activities in EU projects (RRI Practice5 ) 
have aimed to expand RRI to countries outside of Europe, such as India, China or 
Brazil, which in turn raises questions of the value basis of the concept and how 
this varies in different national contexts (Wong, 2016). This of course is also a key 
question for a global TA. 
Additionally, Foresight has evolved as an often- and widely used tool for strategic 
planning and long-term decision-making. According to a well-established deﬁnition, 
Foresight is a systematic, participatory, future intelligence-gathering and medium-
to long-term vision-building process aimed at enabling present-day decisions and 
mobilising joint actions.6 Its roots go back to the early 1980s and took off in the 
1990s, as European and then other countries sought new policy tools to address 
problems in their science, technology and innovation systems (Miles, 2010). 
Finally, impact assessment is a way of dealing with the concrete effects of tech-
nological interventions in nature and society. A large international professional 
community focussing especially on environmental impacts is organised in the Inter-
national Association of Impact Assessment (IAIA).7 Environmental Impact Assess-
ment (EIA), as a widely standardised tool, deals with the environmental implications 
of concrete planning processes, mainly on a regional level. Through the evaluation 
of many projects and their regional focus, it soon became apparent that, in addition 
to environmental impacts, it was above all the effects on the social fabric and socio-
economic status that had to be taken into account. So, the Social Impact Assessment 
(SIA) evolved. SIA is seen as a ﬁeld of research and practice that addresses every-
thing associated with managing social issues throughout the project lifecycle (pre-
conception to post-closure). SIA has transformed from a regulatory tool to being the 
process of managing a project’s social issues, used by developers, ﬁnanciers, affected 
communities and environmental licencing agencies (Vanclay, 2020). 
Several activities at different levels are dedicated to the tensions, interdependen-
cies and opportunities between technology and society—both in the relationship and 
its governance. They all have alliances, platforms, organisations and networks that 
aim to establish professionalisation, exchange, further development and visibility 
for the respective approaches. Of course, this also applies to TA. In addition to the 
EPTA Network8 mentioned above, the TA network (NTA)9 of the German-speaking 
countries is particularly noteworthy. In this network, 55 institutional members 
from Germany, Austria and Switzerland work together. Within the context of these 
networks (e.g. EPTA, NTA), and wider international cooperation in projects such as 
GEST,10 PACITA11 or RRI Practice, the wider importance of a global perspective 
for TA activities has become more and more distinct over the years. Technologies

develop globally and have worldwide impacts; grand challenges go beyond national 
boundaries, and assessments should take this into account. 
3 
The Need for Technology Assessment to Go Global 
The ﬁrst discussion on global TA was initiated with the book “Constructing a Global 
Technology Assessment” (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019), which examined science and 
technology policy systems, decision-making frameworks, priorities and values as 
well as TA(-like) activities in various countries, such as Australia, China, India and 
Russia. This discussion highlighted the existence of a “TA Habitat” (Hennen & 
Nierling, 2015) as a prerequisite for the creation of a global TA. The Habitat 
refers to the elements that are needed in order to have a functioning TA in the 
national context, that can then be assimilated in the multilateral context. In detail, it 
revolves around the decision-making structures, the public accountability system, the 
existence of problem-oriented or hybrid research activities in the academic sector, 
public awareness of STI issues and a wish to articulate societal implications in 
policy-making. 
More importantly, this ﬁrst discussion arrived at an agreement on the parameters 
that would help delineate the functions of a global TA. These include: 
Political System: with a wide range from multi-party to one-party systems, from 
liberal to authoritarian, from socialist to capitalist, from social welfare-oriented to 
free market-oriented, etc., the political system of the country affects the type of 
TA that can be undertaken. Disregarding extreme political systems that are not 
conducible to any type of TA, the prevalent view is that any system that allows 
freedom of expression and includes willingness to accept open debates is a good 
candidate for inclusion in global TA. This also presupposes willingness to accept 
different perspectives, and not simply to accept, or not, the most public forms of TA. 
S&T Governance System: refers to the administrative setup around the STI 
decision-making process, and in particular, how centralised or decentralised this 
might be. The European Union’s multi-national (or transnational) governance 
provides a good example of a multi-national organisation that can perform successful 
TA at central level. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is another 
example of TA-type activity at centralised global level. 
Socio-economic Development Stage: refers to national STI priorities that are 
closely connected to development needs and require particular types of technological 
development. For instance, frugal innovation, i.e. low-tech innovation that is evident 
in less developed regions, requires other approaches to assessment than the high-tech 
innovation sector that TA usually focuses on. 
National Values: refers to norms of behaviour and cultural speciﬁcities that are 
key ingredients in every STI debate. These must be analysed and understood in order 
to identify their impact on decision-making and their role in developing a global TA.

L. Hennen et al.
Next to such conceptual thinking, the globalTA Network12 was founded with 
the aim to concretely develop cooperation among researchers and institutions active 
in research and advice on technology policy, and to establish long-term working 
structures for a global TA. More than 30 members from across the globe represent 
TA(-like) activities from non-proﬁt institutions committed to developing a global 
framework for the assessment of the impacts of technologies, facilitating global 
cooperation and supporting anticipatory governance of new technologies in line 
with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This book is a project of the 
globalTA Network. The contributions here result from thorough discussions among 
members of the network, in a process that has already strengthened its co-operative 
links and potential. The next step is to analyse systematically the framework condi-
tions, opportunities and challenges for setting a global TA into practice. The book 
can thus be regarded as a conceptual endeavour for further activities in the globalTA 
Network.

The Book and Its Contributions 
The contributions to this volume share an understanding that the development of 
S&T, including its social and environmental consequences, can no longer reasonably 
be dealt with solely on a national level. With a view to the economic, social and 
environmental challenges ahead, and the growing interweaving of economic and 
socio-cultural life around the globe, they regard globalisation as a reality in the 
making and hold it to be a political task for the next decades to react to the urgent need 
for democratic and open transnational modes and processes of global governance. 
Indications of militant and aggressive nationalism, and authoritarian attempts to 
prevent nation states and civil societies from open global interchange and socio-
political discourse are virulent and have been shocking the world again as work on 
this volume was completed in early 2022. The contributors to this book are however 
convinced that these tendencies do not offer any viable way to secure the future of 
the globe. They hope in all conﬁdence that in the long run these tendencies will not 
prevail against the civil, cultural, professional, scientiﬁc and political communities 
that constantly strive for open and equal interchange on just solutions for global 
problems, leading to legitimate transnational decision-making. Holding that such 
efforts towards processes and structures of global interchange and understanding 
are all the more urgent, the present volume is a step in this direction in the ﬁeld 
of science and technology policy, and speciﬁcally in TA as an instrument through 
which to base political decisions on the best knowledge available, and on inclusive 
democratic deliberation on norms and values that can guide decisions. 
Triggered by ongoing exchanges within the globalTA Network on the need and 
options for better global cooperation in the ﬁeld of TA, the volume explores what 
globalisation means and can offer for our common efforts, and which parameters

have to be taken into account when jointly working for a global TA. This includes the 
recognition of different cultures and understandings of scientiﬁc policy advice, and 
hence different concepts of TA. It includes a reﬂection on the relevance of processes 
of globalisation for both the mission and practice of professional TA practitioners. It 
also includes a reﬂection on salient problems and ﬁelds of advanced development of 
technologies and the possible contributions from TA. Finally, it includes a reﬂection 
on structures of global discourse and decision-making, and ways for TA to respond 
to these and bring our debate on ways and modes of improved cooperation to the 
next level. 
The volume starts (Part I) with an overview of the global state of play in our 
professional community and the relevance of TA in international governance. In 
the contribution by Julia Hahn, Nils Heyen and Ralf Lindner we—the global TA 
community—try to validate our knowledge of practices of TA-related activities 
worldwide. Based on interviews with colleagues from the globalTA Network, the 
chapter describes and highlights current and relevant developments of technology 
assessment (TA) across several countries and clusters these according to main areas 
of activity or modes of institutionalisation. The focus of this chapter is on twelve 
(mainly) non-European countries which are part of the globalTA Network: Australia, 
Brazil, Chile, China, Czechia, India, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Slovakia, 
Russia and the USA. This provides an overview of the heterogeneity of socio-
political systems which TA may relate to, and modes of institutionalisation that 
characterise TA activities around the world. At the same time, a TA core becomes 
visible: addressing potentials and risks of emerging technologies, reﬂecting ways of 
doing responsible research and innovation, inclusion of stakeholders and the public 
in assessment processes, and others. The supplement of the book provides brief 
Country Reports that serve as an information pool to the overview chapter. In these 
briefs, colleagues from the respective countries reﬂect on the state and challenges of 
national TA activities. 
Shifting from the national to the international policy-making level, Miltos Ladikas 
and Andreas Stamm identify TA’s role in the existing STI multilateral system and 
localise it within existing global decision-making structures. The paper shows that a 
wide spectrum of TA methodologies is employed at the United Nations and multi-
lateral agencies in their efforts to analyse the signiﬁcance of new and emerging tech-
nologies for development. The paper concentrates on the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), where TA is speciﬁcally commissioned as an 
aspiration for the achievement of its development goals. It is especially the activities 
related to the UN SDGs that promise options to overcome the numerous challenges 
that TA faces when applied in developing countries. The chapter concludes with a 
discussion of possible models for organising TA on a global level and discusses the 
signiﬁcance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a role 
model for an independent and effective global TA. 
Part II of the book is dedicated to three challenges that TA faces when trying to 
go global. Leonhard Hennen and Rinie van Est explore the dimensions and problems 
of globalisation, as discussed in the scholarly literature of the last decades, to provide

10
L. Hennen et al.
a general reﬂection on the meaning of globalisation in the ﬁeld of science and tech-
nology governance and identify the challenges of transferring TA activities to the 
global level. Globalisation is understood here as an articulation of “reﬂexive moderni-
sation”, and thus features to a high extent “reﬂexive” problems of governance-
making, such as systematic uncertainties of knowledge and cultural diversity of 
relevant values and norms. Great economic interdependencies as well as inequal-
ities, together with the fact that technological and environmental risks are largely 
of global character and transcend the reach of national policy-making bodies, make 
up the challenges of globalisation. TA is presented as an instrument tailor made for 
reﬂexive governance, and thus as a natural support for politics under the conditions 
of globalisation, if it manages to strengthen its global character. 
TA as a democratic mode of policy advice has a strong relation and commitment 
to the public sphere as a space to express and discuss common concerns and collec-
tive social interests. Rinie van Est and Leonhard Hennen reﬂect on the challenges 
implied in relating TA’s activities to a global public sphere. The chapter’s reﬂections 
follow the “all-affected” principle, which implies that TA should take into account 
all kinds of people that are affected worldwide by science, technology and inno-
vation (STI). It ﬁrst examines the relationship between TA and public spheres that 
deal with the societal signiﬁcance of STI from a national context, because both are 
mainly approached from the point of view of national political decision-making. The 
authors then reﬂect on public spheres in a context of globalisation and describe how 
TA institutes, networks and activities are organised beyond national borders. The 
exploration of the link between public spheres and TA in a global context leads to a 
sketch of a blueprint for the future of global TA. 
One of the main challenges for global TA is transferring the concept of TA as 
democratic policy advice from its origins in the Western world to developing coun-
tries which not share the same cultural and political background and mainly do not 
have the same economic capacities. Ravi Srinivas and Rinie van Est draw some 
lessons for the transfer of TA from the example of India. The chapter provides an 
overview of the TA landscape in India, as an example of TA in a developing country. 
The authors start with a reﬂection on the role and relevance of TA for developing 
countries in general. Focussing on the development of S&T governance in India, 
where most TA-like activities and practices are organised by and for governmental 
agencies, ﬁve examples of formally institutionalised governmental TA-like activities 
are given: governmental TA-like capabilities for technological foresight in general, 
for agricultural, medical and pollution abatement technologies in particular, and 
ﬁnally the only government-organised participatory TA, regarding the introduction 
of a genetically modiﬁed eggplant. In addition, three informal TA-like grassroots 
activities are described. Concluding by reﬂecting on the TA landscape in India, some 
lessons are drawn for the role and conditions for TA in developing countries. 
Part III of the book provides an exploration of four selected ﬁelds of tech-
nology, respectively, policy-making problems—climate change, biotechnology, arti-
ﬁcial intelligence and the COVID-19 pandemic—that clearly show the need for and 
the challenges of global governance, as well as global cooperation and interchange

regarding the scientiﬁc analysis of the social signiﬁcance and effects that emanate 
from these ﬁelds and develop into global policy-making issues. 
Climate Change can be regarded as the most serious challenge for global policy-
making and is an ongoing exercise in ﬁnding ways to globally shared strategies 
for solutions. Peta Ashworth and Elliot Clarke explore the structure, practices and 
methods of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a legitimate 
scientiﬁc institution, and its interplay with the global political decision-making forum 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). By 
examining the successes and shortfalls of the IPCC process and comparing these with 
TA theory and practice, they investigate whether such an institutionalised process 
of co-design between governments and researchers could serve as a potential global 
TA model. They identify central challenges of the IPCC process related to questions 
of political impact, pursuit of consensus, trust and accessibility of information. The 
authors argue that there is potential for each of these problems to be addressed 
using existing analytical TA frameworks, resulting in more authentic and accepted 
outcomes from a global governance perspective. 
Biotechnology involves the use and manipulation of living organisms such as 
plants, animals, humans and biological systems or parts of this, to modify their 
characteristics in order to create desired organisms or products. Biotechnology is 
a ﬁeld that touches on many aspects that are central to TA and have been in its 
focus since the 1980s. By presenting three key topics in biotechnology—genetically 
modiﬁed food and crops (GMO), synthetic biology and human genome germline 
editing (HGGE)—Sophie van Baalen, Ravi Srinivas and Guangxi He show that a 
central feature of biotechnology is that the science is evolving globally and the 
products it brings forth are traded across the globe. But as is typically the case for 
modern technologies nowadays, there are major differences between the regulation 
and governance of the academic and industrial sectors across countries. These stem 
from different needs and interest per country, as well as differences in traditions, 
cultural differences and public perceptions. As global governance is fragmented, 
with little scope for harmonisation, global TA of biotechnology can bring clarity, 
better understanding and enable better governance. In order to do so, an integrated 
global TA framework should consider international trade, differences in risk assess-
ment, cultural variation and different value-systems between countries, as well as 
differences in countries’ capacities in R&D and coordination of public engagement 
efforts. 
Based on a large scale of technology application scenarios, artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI) is expected to have disruptive impact on economies and societies. Lei Huang 
and Walter Peissl argue that breakthroughs have been made recently in basic research 
on the fundamental technologies, so that AI is showing greater potential to become 
a general-purpose technology. In the domain of TA, research on AI and its potential 
impacts has been considered early. The research questions, which include impacts on 
the workforce as well as on societal communication and democracy, and fundamental 
issues such as responsibility, transparency and ethics have drawn widespread atten-
tion from TA studies. The chapter presents a scholarly discussion of AI topics in the

12
L. Hennen et al.
context of TA, based on a qualitative analysis of AI policy databases from the Organ-
isation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European 
Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network. The analysis concludes that 
enhancing global cooperation in TA will contribute to addressing fundamental ethical 
and societal issues of AI, which in turn broadens the knowledge base and helps to 
pave the way for more inclusive and just use of AI. 
A recent case showing the need for concerted global governance to increase 
social resilience to crisis is the COVID-19 pandemic. Marko Monteiro, Florian 
Roth and Clare Shelley Egan examine the governance of health technologies during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. They reﬂect on three interrelated challenges that need 
to be addressed in future assessment approaches for achieving systemic resilience: 
problems of scale, trust and politics. The chapter focuses on digital surveillance 
technologies and vaccines; two cornerstones in the efforts to mitigate the spread of 
SARS-CoV-2 around the globe. Tracing apps were introduced in many countries, 
but their effectiveness has been constrained by issues of data privacy, insufﬁcient 
interoperability and digital inequalities. In parallel, a global research race enabled 
the development of different vaccines with unprecedented speed, building on inno-
vative biotechnologies. However, vaccination worldwide was marked by disparities 
in access and controversy. The authors conclude that governance and assessment 
should be built around strong international coordination and cooperation, without 
limiting local experimental learning and innovation. Further, public trust should be 
considered as a necessary condition for the success of any technological innovation 
in the health context. As trust in policymakers, academia and industry is strongly 
context-speciﬁc, global governance should also be sensitive to the diversity of social 
and cultural contexts. Finally, to improve overall systemic resilience, global power 
imbalances should be addressed in all phases of the innovation process. 
The concluding chapter (Outlook) draws tentative conclusions from the ﬁndings 
of these contributions with regard to possible future ways to organise TA on a global 
scale. These considerations comprise a discussion of possible organisational shapes 
that can support the global interchange and sharing of TA capacities and increase its 
political relevance and operability on a global level. Beyond such medium- and long-
term aspirations, the outlook reﬂects on more short-term practical steps that could 
be taken within the globalTA Network to improve interchange of knowledge and 
expertise, engage in joint projects and mutually foster analytical and methodological 
capacities.

Technology Assessment in a Globalized 
World

Tracing Technology Assessment 
Internationally—TA Activities in 12 
Countries Across the Globe 
Julia Hahn, Nils B. Heyen, and Ralf Lindner 
1 Introduction 
This chapter describes and highlights current and relevant developments of tech-
nology assessment (TA) across 12 countries within the globalTA network1 and clus-
ters these according to their main areas of activity. Overall, we understand TA as a 
“scientiﬁc, interactive, and communicative process which aims to contribute to the 
formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and tech-
nology” (Bütschi et al., 2004, 14). This involves various approaches and methods, 
including scientiﬁc assessments, policy analysis, and participatory processes, which 
are used to understand the societal implications of technology and innovation in a 
multitude of dimensions, thereby taking into account the different cultural contexts 
in which technology development unfolds. TA as a term is not necessarily used alike 
in different national contexts. Instead, other approaches such as ELSA/ELSI (ethical, 
legal, and social aspects/implications), Responsible Innovation (RI) or Responsible 
Research and Innovation (RRI), sustainability studies, societal effects of science and

technology (S&T), etc., may be more common (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019). Looking 
at different national contexts allows for a detailed view of these activities regarding 
the interrelation of S&T and public/political/societal settings, and to frame these as 
TA or “TA-like”. By tracing current TA or “TA-like” activities in selected coun-
tries across the globe, this chapter highlights several developments, initiatives, or 
methods, which are relevant for a global perspective on TA. In order to remain in the 
scope of this volume, the focus of this chapter is mainly on non-European countries, 
especially because the European TA landscape has been extensively described and 
analyzed elsewhere (e.g., Hennen & Ladikas, 2019). Since the globalTA network 
unites researchers and institutions from around the world working in the area of TA, 
members of the network were invited to share practical insights into their activities. 
This provides a unique impression of TA-like activities in Australia, Brazil, Chile, 
China, Czechia, India, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Slovakia, and the 
USA. 
The starting point for this chapter was to conduct interviews (JH, NH) with glob-
alTA network members in each of the 12 countries, which enabled discussions 
about current activities and developments. The interview partners then provided 
brief reports outlining the situation of TA in their respective national settings (see 
Country Reports, in the supplement of this volume). The Country Reports all follow 
the same structure including, (i) the country-speciﬁc context, (ii) speciﬁc highlights 
of TA activities (e.g., projects, technologies, and methods), and (iii) outlook and 
challenges regarding TA in the national setting, and the potential for a global level of 
TA. Based on these Country Reports, this chapter clusters and localizes the country-
speciﬁc TA activities (Sect. 2) and reﬂects on what can be learned from this global 
analysis (Sect. 3). 
2 Mapping of Country-Speciﬁc TA Activities 
The Country Reports were analyzed and clustered with regard to the various modes 
of institutionalization of TA. We build on the three main areas of parliamentary TA 
that have been identiﬁed in the European TA landscape (Hennen & Ladikas, 2019, 
62): politics (committee model of TA), science (ofﬁce model of TA), and the public 
(interactive model of TA). These areas show various manifestations of TA practices, 
strongly characterized by speciﬁc political cultures, yet TA institutions are often 
active in all three areas. For the global context, we expanded the TA activities to 
be considered, focusing not only on parliamentary TA. This expands the original 
TA landscape from the European context to consider TA activities in an international 
context that are not necessarily termed as “TA” and are embedded in different institu-
tional settings. In addition, in a context in which TA is emerging there may not be an 
institutionalized form (yet). Corresponding with the deﬁnition of TA as an interactive 
and communicative process, this broader view enables a range of different actors and 
activities to be considered. We used the three areas (politics, science, and public) as

Modes of Institutionalization of TA(-like) Activities 
Fig. 1 Modes of institutionalization of TA (-like) activities in the 12 countries 
a starting point, but considered wider areas of TA activities and application, such as 
research programs, networks, or government ministries. 
Based on the expert interviews and Country Reports, we identiﬁed ﬁve main areas 
of TA activities—or ﬁve modes of institutionalization of TA—in the 12 countries 
(see Fig. 1): 
(a) 
A distinct TA ofﬁce, which is the institutionalization mode closest to Politics, 
whether in the form of government ministries or the parliament; 
(b) Research funding programs of government ministries that are oriented toward 
responsible (research and) innovation (RRI or RI), localized between politics 
and science; 
(c) 
Scientiﬁc institutions conducting TA, which is the institutionalization mode 
closest to science with its main function in research and education; 
(d) Participatory TA activities and networks, which often include NGOs, think tanks 
or other civil society actors, therefore, being close to public; and 
(e) 
TA agencies or government ministries that are oriented toward the public and 
can, therefore, be located between politics and public. 
Figure 1 shows where the country-speciﬁc TA activities described in this chapter 
can be located in terms of institutionalization. In some countries, a variety of TA 
activities take place, thus these countries are located in more than one area of institu-
tionalization. This is a ﬁrst account of clustering TA across different national contexts, 
and deeper analysis of the speciﬁc socio-political contexts, institutional settings and 
formation of TA in each country would be a necessary next step in order to gain a 
more in-depth picture. Yet, this ﬁrst clustering can provide some insights into the 
aspects that are important for TA to emerge and then institutionalize, and provides 
ﬁrst indications of which actors may be important in these processes. In the following,

20
J. Hahn et al.
we present some of these insights and provide more details on the localization of the 
country-speciﬁc TA activities, drawing on the Country Reports (Fig. 1). 
Politics 
TA’s origins at the Ofﬁce of Technology Assessment (OTA) as part of the US Congress 
in the 1970s, together with current networks such as the European Parliamentary 
Technology Assessment (EPTA) understand TA as an integral part of scientiﬁc policy 
advice and democratic parliamentary decision-making. This “Parliamentary TA” can 
be found in several countries examined here. 
In the USA (cf. Guston, in this volume), for instance, there is a group of experts at 
the Government Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO), which mainly serves the US Congress 
and is led by the US Comptroller General, with responsibility for auditing and eval-
uation. Some connections to TA can be found, even though this is mostly attached to 
the expert mode of practice, in the tradition of OTA. As described in the US Country 
Report, GAO has emerged as a small but well-regarded TA capacity which has 
provided reports on various technologies (recently 5G, CRISPR, climate tech, and 
health), as well as reports focused on more concise and decision-centered information 
and communication at the parliamentary and government level. 
In South Korea (cf. Choi, in this volume), parliamentary TA activities have also 
been taking place in a formalized way for some time. The Ministry of Science 
is responsible for TA, and within the Korea Institute of Science and Technology 
Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP), studies and reports on speciﬁc technologies are 
published each year, with the results reported to the Presidential Advisory Council 
on Science and Technology (PACST). In this way, TA ﬁndings are potentially incor-
porated into policymaking and budget planning. Experts carry out TA analyses on the 
effects and issues of emerging technologies, and a Citizen Forum discusses impli-
cations and impacts (see “public” paragraph below). According to the analysis in 
the South Korean Country Report, the future of TA development should focus on 
simplifying the TA process in order to be able to evaluate more technologies per 
year, and on raising general awareness of TA through new media. The opening up 
and diversifying of methods such as the Citizen Forum can be seen as an important 
development in South Korea to widen the perspectives of parliamentary advice. 
We also ﬁnd a clear location of parliamentary TA within the political system in 
Chile (cf. Weidenslaufer and Roberts, in this volume). The Parliamentary Technical 
Advisory Service (Asesoría Técnica Parlamentaria, ATP-BCN) was created in 2007, 
and is made up of forty researchers and advisors from various ﬁelds. They support 
legislative committees on a permanent basis and provide assessment of comparative 
law, comparisons of public policies, and assessments of technical aspects subject 
to regulation and their societal relevance. As described in the Country Report, in 
Chile, there is a renewed interest toward science in the public debate (e.g., due to 
COVID-19). In turn, ATP-BCN has established networks and protocols with scientiﬁc 
experts and parliamentary decision-makers. In 2020, a new task force was created to 
promote TA methodologies and products among ATP-BCN researchers and advisors 
(“Scientiﬁc Legislative Advisory”, ACL), showing an increase in TA as a scientiﬁc 
activity.

21
In Poland (cf. Soler et al., in this volume), the Bureau of Research of the Polish 
Parliament (Biuro Analiz Sejmowych, BAS) was established in 1991, and is the 
leading national institution specializing in legislative aspects of TA. The Polish Asso-
ciation for Technology Assessment (PTOT) works on the development of new TA 
concepts and the improvement of research methods and tools. The various activities 
of TA, mainly in academic ﬁelds, are brought together through PTOT. 
Besides this clear location within the parliamentary system, there are TA (-like) 
activities in agencies and think tanks with close proximity to ministries and govern-
ment. In India (cf. Srinivas, in this volume), the Technology Information, Fore-
casting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) is an organization under the Department 
of Science & Technology. It has developed the “Technology Vision 2035” (a strategy 
paper describing S&T focus areas) and has supported innovation-related programs 
dealing with intellectual property rights, technology development, and commercial-
ization. Yet overall, according to the Country Report, activities in India cannot neces-
sarily be classiﬁed as “Technology Assessment”. “Technology evaluation”, “impact 
assessment”, and “techno-economic study/assessment” are some of the terms used 
in various documents and in the mandates of various institutions and programs. The 
government has supported Health Technology Assessment (HTA), but in general, 
there is a lack of a speciﬁc agency to coordinate, standardize methods and help with 
capacity building efforts. 
Monteiro and Matenhauer Urbinatti describe an overall crisis in the positioning of 
science and technology within society in Brazil (cf. this volume), which in turn has 
effects on the opportunities for TA activities. The Country Report mainly describes 
HTA activities, which are a speciﬁc form of assessment focused on health prod-
ucts, clinical aspects, and cost-beneﬁt analyses of drugs or health applications, and 
as such represent a very different community than TA. The current situation with 
COVID-19 vaccines is an example of HTA which shows challenges. Chinese Coro-
navac vaccine has become an issue of dispute between the Federal Government and 
the State Government of São Paulo. This argument has centered around issues of 
the origin of the vaccine, its efﬁcacy, and conspiracy theories, anti-vaccine move-
ments, and misinformation. The Russian vaccine Sputnik V was also controversial 
in Brazil regarding the regulatory process, and featured in political disputes between 
government agencies. This focus on HTA activities also indicates a more restricted 
understanding of TA and the activities taking place. Overall, in Brazil, interrelated 
developments have had severe effects, also regarding TA (-like) activities. Large 
budget cuts to research and an increase in denialism and critique of scientiﬁc exper-
tise have led to a division of science and society, while calls for opening up science 
and technology policy aim to increase legitimacy. The analysis by our Brazilian 
experts shows how hugely problematic it is to establish TA-like activities in Brazil, 
due to highly contested socio-political disputes. 
Science 
Another important area for TA (-like) activities across the 12 countries is science 
and research in the respective institutional settings. It seems that this is the main area 
of interest for emerging TA activities, where these are not institutionalized (yet).

22
J. Hahn et al.
Academia can be a key player when initiating TA activities in countries without 
established (parliamentary) forms of TA. Within several Country Reports, we ﬁnd 
activities which are relevant for TA in academic education and in network building 
and research. 
According to the Russia Country Report (cf. Kazakova and Gavrilina, in this 
volume), TA initiatives can be found in the largest technical universities, such as the 
Bauman University (BMSTU) in Moscow. Here, TA education is integrated into the 
pilot master program, “Social Analysis of Technological Innovations and Risks”, 
which aims to provide practice-oriented training and knowledge on sociotechnical 
processes. Also, courses on sociology of technology or engineering ethics are imple-
mented into the engineering curriculum. BMSTU and the technical universities of 
Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tomsk, and Perm have initiated the “TA and STS in 
Russia Association”, which brings together institutions, enterprises, and govern-
ment analytical centers. Overall, a main challenge for TA in Russia is a missing 
balance between the development of economies and technology across the Russian 
regions. This raises issues of lack of access to basic infrastructure and information 
on environmental effects. Further, the cultural and ethnic diversity of the country is a 
challenge regarding the understanding of public perceptions of technologies. A lack 
of transparency regarding decision-making in the technical processes creates uneven 
distribution of knowledge and responsibilities in society. This requires comparative 
and contextualized views of technologies and their potential beneﬁts and risks. 
In the Country Report from Czechia (cf. Soler et al., in this volume), we learn 
that there are no real established TA institutions, but that research activities are of 
importance, especially in European TA-related projects. The Technology Centre of 
the Czech Academy of Science (TC CAS) has been involved in several European 
projects, which in turn have changed public and policy-makers’ views due to more 
representation of TA, and public engagement in S&T or research and development 
policy strategies. Similarly, in Slovakia (cf. Soler et al., in this volume), there is no 
clear TA institution, yet the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) can be considered as 
an aspiring TA institution. Past TA activities on nuclear energy and human enhance-
ment technologies were conducted by SAV, which lacks resources and capacities, yet 
is advocating for TA in the country. In general, in the three described Central Euro-
pean countries (Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia), there are institutions that conduct 
TA-like activities, but these remain mainly uncoordinated. 
Another area of relevance to TA is RRI activities, which can be found as 
part of funding programs in research organizations, or as governance frameworks. 
For example, the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development 
(CASTED) participated in the Horizon 2020 European research project “Responsible 
Research & Innovation in practice”2 and introduced RRI as a governance research 
concept to case studies in China (cf. Huang, in this volume). Overall, TA, RRI, 
and sustainable development have been included in research, especially regarding 
areas such as research ethics, open science, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), or the digital 
economy. According to the China Country Report, the fast development of S&T in
2 www.rri-practice.eu.

China has put issues of research ethics and integrity at the center of attention for many 
stakeholders, such as scientists, businesses, the government, and the wider public. 
Therefore, approaches such as RRI or TA, as well as Open Science, are regarded as 
useful tools for researchers and policy-makers in China. 
According to the Australia Country Report (cf. Lacey and Fielke, in this volume), 
Responsible Innovation (RI) is also an important approach. The country’s national 
science agency, the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation 
(CSIRO), has adopted RI as one of its future science platforms, which represent 
new research programs and funding. This was based on previous work on R(R)I 
in European contexts and projects, and has developed a ten-year impact pathway 
for delivering RI for Australian S&T development. Applied research capacities in 
RI and its application are advancing, yet the outcomes of applying RI approaches 
especially through “blue sky” research investments are still open. Its seems that 
bringing together ﬁndings from a wide array of projects to better understand what 
has worked and what can be taken up by different stakeholders remains a challenge. 
Public 
The localization of TA in a more public sphere can be found in several of the 12 
countries in the form of participatory activities, and wider networks that include 
different TA-like or adjacent institutions. In South Korea (cf. Choi, in this volume), 
participatory elements are included in parliamentary TA processes. A Citizen Forum 
is implemented to discuss the impacts of technologies and provide recommenda-
tions. Before ﬁnalizing TA reports, the Korea Institute of Science and Technology 
Evaluation and Planning (KISTEP) holds an open forum, during which the results, 
and TA in general, are communicated. 
In South Africa (cf. Mugabe, in this volume), both expert-led more top-down 
activities as well as multi-stakeholder participatory biotechnology assessment can 
be observed. The South African Agency of Science and Technology Advancement 
(SAASTA) launched a program in 2003 named South Africa’s Public Understanding 
of Biotechnology (PUB), which aimed to increase public awareness and under-
standing, and promote public dialogue on the socio-economic and environmental 
impacts. Overall, TA seems to be in its early beginnings in Africa, but according 
to the South Africa Country Report there is a demand to include it in STI policy 
processes. It seems that in African countries there is an increasing body of scien-
tiﬁc knowledge and technological innovation, which in turn shows the need for TA. 
To improve awareness, capacity building, and sharing of information and experi-
ences, it is necessary to establish an African TA network, strengthen institutional 
coordination, and improve policy frameworks. 
Participatory and network activities can both be found in the USA (cf. Guston, 
in this volume). For instance, Expert and Citizen Assessment of Science and Tech-
nology (ECAST) is an initiative which aims to revive more participatory forms of 
TA. Further, an emerging ﬁeld of “Public Interest Technology” can be observed, 
which sees TA as an important part of its potential contributions. The Public Interest 
Technology University Network plays an important role here, with more than 40 
members, and small grants that support TA-like projects.

24
J. Hahn et al.
As observed in the Australia Country Report (cf. Lacey and Fielke, in this volume), 
we also ﬁnd participatory activities within the framework of RI, which are aimed at 
risk/beneﬁt assessment as well as the uncertainties of S&T in light of advancements 
for society. For instance, there has been research to combine Indigenous Knowledge 
and AI for the improvement of environmental management in Northern Australia, 
which shows a speciﬁc example of participation and TA at a regional and community 
level. 
3 Reﬂections 
Reviewing the country-speciﬁc descriptions of TA activities across the globe illus-
trates the high heterogeneity of socio-political systems, modes of institutionaliza-
tion of TA, and TA practices in the 12 countries discussed. Overall, it appears as 
if approaches aiming at the “public” are more dispersed and ﬂuid and less insti-
tutionalized when compared to TA manifestations in “science” and “politics”. In 
an attempt to further identify similarities, differences and patterns between TA 
institutionalization across the analyzed country cases, we ﬁrst look at the topical 
substance and the intended impact of TA and TA-like activities. Subsequently, a more 
bird’s eye perspective is taken on the broader structural conditions within which TA 
institutionalizes and is performed. 
In all 12 Country Reports, the TA core is clearly visible: researchers in different 
settings are addressing the potentials and risks of emerging technologies, exploring 
ways to perform RRI, analyzing issues of trust and acceptance by the public and 
different stakeholders, investigating science and technology governance, etc. Another 
communality lies in the technologies with which the socio-political systems are 
confronted, whether this is AI, digitalization, health, or biotechnologies. In all 12 
Country Reports, we ﬁnd descriptions of challenges associated with sociotechnical 
issues and different ways and levels of approaching them. 
In terms of the mission of TA activities and their intended impact, it is interesting 
to see that a main focus of TA activities, both in Europe and globally, seems to lie on 
impacts. These include a) improving knowledge about the technological or scientiﬁc 
aspects of the subject in focus, b) forming attitudes and opinions with respect to 
agenda-setting in research or politics, or c) with respect to self-reﬂection and bridge 
building between different stakeholders. This becomes apparent when applying the 
typology of impacts developed in the TAMI project (Decker & Ladikas, 2004). In this 
chapter, three impact dimensions have been cross-tabulated with three issue dimen-
sions of TA (Hennen et al., 2004, 63). The TAMI impacts can also be understood as 
intended impacts, or the mission of TA activities and institutions. The impact dimen-
sions include raising knowledge (through scientiﬁc assessment, social mapping, and 
policy analysis), forming attitudes and opinions of actors (through agenda-setting, 
mediation, and re-structuring the policy debate), and initializing actions (through 
reframing debates, new decision-making processes, and decisions taken); the issue 
dimensions include technological and scientiﬁc, societal, and policy aspects. Table 1

shows the classiﬁcation of the country-speciﬁc TA activities into the resulting TAMI 
table. As is the case for the European TA landscape (Decker & Ladikas, 2004), most 
TA activities seem to address the upper left area of the TAMI table. This is not 
surprising, since raising knowledge and forming attitudes/opinions represent the key 
impact dimensions of both classical and participatory TA (Hennen et al., 2004). 
In sum, the great heterogeneity of different country-speciﬁc settings in which TA 
takes place and is performed globally, cannot hide the fact that on a substantive and 
methodological level TA faces similar challenges. 
The Country Reports also brieﬂy describe the individual country backgrounds 
and political settings, which in turn are relevant for TA activities. This can be under-
stood as the “habitat” in which TA takes place (Hennen & Nierling, 2015), which 
is structured by aspects such as the political system, S&T decision-making systems, 
socio-economic development stage or values (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019). Drawing 
conclusions from the comparative analysis of the cases has to be done with caution 
due to both the limited number of cases analyzed and the information provided in 
the Country Reports, as these are only a brief highlight of TA relevant activities and 
structures. However, while taking this limitation into account, a closer look allows 
us to point to a number of noteworthy observations and preliminary insights with 
regard to the relationship between TA manifestations and the broader institutional 
and structural contexts.

The following interrelated factors have been identiﬁed that begin to explain 
similarities and differences between TA manifestations between the 12 countries: 
• The key characteristics of the polity, including the degree and quality of 
democratic decision-making and basic structural features; 
• The types and intensities of political conﬂicts about scientiﬁc-technological 
issues, including the role of science in society and in policy-related decision-
making; 
• The developmental levels of and opportunity structures for science, technology, 
and innovation in the respective political economies and the socio-economic 
make-up of the countries, including the steering capacities of the state with regard 
to techno-scientiﬁc developments and innovation. 
With regard to the characteristics of the polity, the question of the democratic 
quality of the political system and the rule of law seems to be a potentially useful 
predictor of the degree of TA institutionalization, understood as the existence of 
fairly stable and formalized organizational structures and procedures within which 
TA is conducted. If the liberal democracy index of the V-Dem Institute is applied 
(Boese et al., 2022),3 our 12 selected countries cover nearly the whole spectrum of 
the index score: six countries are among the top 20%, three are in the top 30–50%, 
one is in the bottom 40–50%, and another two are located in the bottom 10–20% 
(see Table 2). 
While any correlation between TA manifestations and scoring on the liberal 
democracy index should be treated with caution, we can observe that low scores 
on the index correlate with low degrees of TA institutionalization, as is the case for 
India, China, and Russia. However, the opposite relationship is not supported by 
our selected cases: a high rating on the liberal democracy index is not uniformly 
reﬂected by high degrees of TA institutionalization. Instead, among the top 50% of
3 The V-Dem liberal democracy index rates over 180 countries based on 71 indicators, covering 
aspects such as quality of the electoral process, freedom of expression, protection of civil liberties, 
and checks and balances between governmental institutions (http://www.v-dem.net).

the countries included in our study, signiﬁcant differences in terms of TA institution-
alization are evident. While South Korea, Chile, the USA, and Poland have estab-
lished specialized ofﬁces or services generating TA-related knowledge for policy, 
TA remains largely informal and limited to academia in other countries of this high 
rated group. 
Another potentially useful structural factor in understanding different pathways 
toward TA institutionalization refers to the general structure of the polity of the 
democratic systems among our 12 selected cases. It can be expected that particu-
larly presidential systems are more inclined to establish parliamentary TA ofﬁces 
due to the stronger separation of legislative and executive powers, thus increasing 
the need of the legislature to have access to its own scientiﬁc advice infrastruc-
ture. This relationship seems to be supported by the example of the USA, where 
the ﬁrst parliamentary TA ofﬁce—the OTA—was established in 1972 (but was also 
defunded roughly twenty years later). Other presidential systems with institution-
alized TA ofﬁces or services are Chile and Poland. In South Korea’s presidential 
system, however, the TA facilities are part of the executive branch. These obser-
vations, together with the fact that a number of parliamentary democracies have 
established TA ofﬁces connected to the legislature, such as Austria or Germany, 
indicate that macro-institutional factors of the polity are a rather weak predictor of 
speciﬁc country pathways toward institutionalization. 
While establishing relationships between basic structural features of the polity 
and TA has rather limited explanatory strength, linking TA to political and soci-
etal patterns of conﬂict over techno-scientiﬁc issues and socio-economic condi-
tions related to science, technology, and innovation is likely to be more promising. 
Although signiﬁcantly more in-depth knowledge is needed to arrive at generaliz-
able insights in this regard, the Country Reports provide valuable evidence on the 
interplay of these complex framework conditions on the different trajectories of TA 
developments. For instance, the report from Brazil can be seen as an example of the 
challenges in any attempt to develop TA under the rule of an outright anti-scientiﬁc 
federal government. In Russia, the prospects for academic freedom and thus TA are 
considerably worse in view of the far-reaching and recently ampliﬁed infringements 
of freedom of speech, civil rights, and the rule of law. 
In terms of possible pathways toward the institutionalization of TA, the Country 
Reports provide useful insights. A ﬁrst, though not overly surprising observation, 
is that academia seems to be the “birthplace” of TA across all 12 countries. Thus, 
the realm of science and research develops and provides the foundational exper-
tise needed for further uptake and institutionalization of TA. And in those instances 
where TA thus far has not reached beyond the science system, academia serves as an 
important reservoir of expertise needed for institutionalization at later stages. More-
over, even in those countries that are unlikely to establish formal TA institutions in 
the near future, conducting academic TA studies and offering training can provide 
important contributions to TA capacity building, and sensitizing actors about critical 
perspectives on the complex interplay between technology and society. Second, a 
number of Country Reports showing currently low levels of TA institutionalization, 
such as Australia, China, Czechia, Slovakia, and South Africa, all stress the important

28
J. Hahn et al.
role of international exchanges with TA actors, and particularly the conduct of joint 
TA or RRI projects. While this observation clearly suggests maintaining and even 
increasing efforts for international cooperation, it also indicates a rather precarious 
situation for TA in these countries, as sustained funding is scarce or even non-existent. 
Third, in some of the countries with very low levels of TA institutionalization, speciﬁc 
variants of TA or neighboring approaches to assessment, such as HTA and Envi-
ronmental Impact Assessment (EIA), are comparatively well-developed and highly 
institutionalized. This is the case, for instance, in Brazil, Australia, South Africa, and 
India. It remains to be seen if the existence of such related approaches might provide 
entry points for the institutionalization of TA at a later stage. For this to materialize, 
however, explicit connections to the STI policy ﬁeld will have to be established. 
Similarly, some of the country cases report a stronger focus on RRI than conven-
tional TA. While this might be an expression of deliberate emphasis on inﬂuencing 
research and innovation practices rather than generating orientation via TA-based 
policy advice, embedding RRI in STI policy might nonetheless help to pave the way 
toward TA, due to the many conceptual and epistemic commonalities between the 
two approaches. 
The discussion of the interplay between structural context factors and TA institu-
tionalization was a ﬁrst step in improving our understanding of the different pathways 
toward TA. Undoubtedly, more comparative research on these issues will be required 
in order to provide answers on conducive and hindering factors of TA institution-
alization across the globe. The emerging globalTA network could provide valuable 
contributions in such a collective research process.

Technology Assessment in a Multilateral 
Science, Technology and Innovation 
System

1 Introduction 
The standard role of Technology Assessment (TA) has always been to serve the 
national policymaking community in its aims to devise a successful Science, Tech-
nology and Innovation (STI) policy. Even when TA became involved in public debates 
with wider stakeholder representation and initiated new methodological approaches 
to cover the needs of such debates, it remained within the realm of national debates 
about the effect of STI developments in a speciﬁc country or region within it (Hennen, 
2002). But the current challenges that STI is required to resolve are, more often than 
not, international or even global in nature. 
There is a common understanding that the main grand challenges that our societies 
face are not unique to a particular country, region or even cultural context (Robinson, 
2007). Most of the grand challenges of our times (e.g. food security, climate change, 
pandemics, air pollution, soil degradation, depletion of ﬁsh stocks, ocean contamina-
tion, etc.) are global in nature. No country alone can deal with such enormous scales 
of intervention, and no solution can be effective at a local level of involvement alone. 
It is therefore inevitable to argue that global challenges require global solutions, 
which in itself means effective societal transformations and policy interventions on 
scales not previously seen in human history.

At the same time, there is considerable uncertainty as to the best available means of 
intervention and the technological developments to be used, since the science behind 
large-scale interventions is incredibly complex and untested. The only certainty is that 
STI developments are urgently needed to deal with the challenges of our times, and 
there is clearly a need to establish a level of multilateral coordination and governance 
of STI. This in turn requires the expansion of national plans and assessment capa-
bilities, including monitoring and evaluation of technologies of interest. In essence, 
the gap between the national and international levels of TA must be bridged, if we 
are to deal effectively with grand challenges. Multilateral cooperation in TA has the 
potential to enhance the outcome and impact of strategies targeted towards grand 
challenges, due to economies of scale, economies of scope and network effects. 
However, while many arguments call for scaling up STI cooperation, national 
governments are still reluctant to invest public resources in existing or new transna-
tional programmes. Different stances of national governments towards technological 
trajectories often hinder cooperative approaches. This is especially relevant when it 
comes to disruptive innovations that entail opportunities and risks which are not 
fully known. At the same time, STI developments have intended or unintended 
effects that transcend international borders and political contexts. Even under a shared 
ethics of responsibility, politicians and research implementers may come to opposite 
conclusions about what constitutes a responsible approach to new technologies. For 
instance, some actors and observers see break-through innovations, such as genome 
editing, as important and even strategic in addressing global challenges (climate 
change, food security, etc.), while others assess them as developments containing 
severe and unacceptable global risks (Ladikas, 2019). 
Overall, which lines of research and technology development are considered as 
responsible is very context-speciﬁc and can lead to fundamentally different direc-
tions in the innovation process. At the same time, multilateral STI cooperation can 
only work as a catalyst for incremental and disruptive innovations to address global 
challenges, if a sufﬁcient number of countries assess the same lines of research and 
innovation as responsible and acceptable for further development. This is exactly 
the focus of global TA and its main function in promoting the necessary multilateral 
STI cooperation (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019). However, before accepting that TA is an 
integral part of the pathway to resolving global challenges, it is necessary to identify 
TA’s role in the existing multilateral system and locate it within the decision-making 
structures.

2 Technology Assessment in the United Nations System 
and Multilateral Organisations 
2.1 
TA in Multilateral Organisations 
The foremost global STI governance structure is located within the United Nations 
(UN) system, which is also ultimately the natural place for the development of global 
TA. The history of the UN is intrinsically related to STI developments. Founded to 
keep global peace after World War II, it soon became the main debate and analysis 
centre for a wide range of technologies with direct effect in peace and development, 
prominent amongst them being nuclear power, food and agriculture technologies 
and medicinal technologies. Specialised agencies were created to deal in depth with 
technological developments, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and 
the World Health Organization (WHO), and afﬁliated bodies dedicated to speciﬁc 
technologies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In addition, 
there are many autonomous multilateral funds, programmes, research and training 
institutes, and other subsidiary bodies that deal with STI issues, such as the Direc-
torate for Science, Technology and Innovation of the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Although the evaluation and assessment 
of new and emerging technologies in relation to the remit of each organisation are 
central to their functions, there is no standard common methodological approach to 
achieve this. The common application of TA as in regular use at European institutes 
(e.g. European parliamentary ofﬁces of TA) is evident in many cases, but is rarely 
named as such. Examples include: 
The World Commission on the Ethics of Scientiﬁc Knowledge and Technology 
(COMEST): an active forum of UNESCO that is mandated to formulate ethical 
principles that could provide decision-makers with criteria that extend beyond purely 
economic considerations. It is active in several STI areas, such as nanotechnologies, 
converging technologies and ICT. 
The Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) of the World Bank: tasked to support 
design of better national policies and build capacity, ASA provides analytical reports 
on critical STI developments in crucial areas for development such as energy and 
digitization. Much of the analysis is based on participatory TA principles. 
The Ofﬁce of Innovation (OIN) at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): 
assists member countries in understanding innovation to drive socio-economic 
growth, ensure food and nutrition security, alleviate poverty and improve resilience 
to climate change. It instigates debates and provides technology assessment reports 
to governments in key areas such as digital agriculture. 
The Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation of the Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): develops evidence-based policy 
advice on the contribution of science, technology and industry to well-being and 
economic growth. It provides assessment reports in a wide number of technologies 
including artiﬁcial intelligence, space technology, genomics, energy, etc.

34
M. Ladikas and A. Stamm
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): includes the “review missions 
and advisory services” that deal with extensive assessment of technologies aiming 
at nuclear safety and security, as well as assessment of nuclear energy applications 
in the health sector. 
The Nature Futures Framework (NFF) of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES): within the overall orga-
nizational aim to assess the state of various biodiversity and ecosystem systems, the 
NFF performs visioning exercises with scientists, indigenous peoples, the private 
sector, civil society organizations and decision-makers, using participatory TA tools. 
All of these UN and multilateral agencies employ, amongst others, TA method-
ologies to analyse new and emerging technologies and provide policy input. Their 
remit is diverse but it is basically that of a typical government think tank with partial 
focus on STI issues. The work of these agencies is not coordinated centrally as they 
are independent entities with their own boards of directors/trustees with no evident 
connection between agencies. This can lead to overlapping focus and competing 
views that are published and promoted independently of each other, even to the same 
target audience. Moreover, the identiﬁcation and positioning of TA within the work 
programme of these agencies is a complex endeavour with uncertain results. The 
reason for this is that TA is not explicitly mentioned as a guiding research process, 
even though there is a clear afﬁnity of conceptual and methodological aspects in their 
analyses of STI issues. 
2.2 
The Role of TA in the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development 
A particular case in the UN system where TA is well entrenched as a guiding principle 
is that of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). 
The reasons for this unique approach go back to the early history of UNCTAD, where 
the role of technology in economic development was identiﬁed as a crucial factor 
in its efforts to support developing countries to access the beneﬁts of a globalized 
economy in a fairer and more effective manner. 
As early as 1949, Raúl Prebisch, Executive Secretary of the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and 
Secretary-General of UNCTAD from 1964 to 1969, analysed the unequal economic 
relations between Latin America and the industrialized Global North. Growing 
disparities in economic growth and well-being between the two hemispheres were 
traced back to different trade specializations, with Latin America being conﬁned 
to the export of mostly unprocessed mineral resources and agricultural products, 
while the Global North traded industrial goods with increasingly higher knowledge 
content and technological sophistication. One consequence of this unequal trade was 
the changes of price relations in the exchanged goods that beneﬁt the Global North 
to the disadvantage of the Global South. In addition, the gap in usage of technology

Technology Assessment in a Multilateral Science, Technology …
35
was found to increase in times of unequal trade patterns, as innovations are often 
driven by the manufacturing sector in the search for higher levels of productivity. 
In Latin America, ECLAC promoted industrialization mainly by means of import 
substitution as a key strategy for lowering the development gap between the North and 
the South, whereby formerly imported industrial items should be replaced by locally 
manufactured goods.1 At UNCTAD, a similar reading of the main reasons for unequal 
international development pushed the struggle for fundamental changes in interna-
tional trade relations under the concept of the “New International Economic Order 
(NIEO)”. Improvements in international trade relations would require a narrowing of 
the technology gap, since the application of state-of-the-art technology is a prerequi-
site for manufacturing items which may fulﬁl the needs of customers, both in terms 
of quality and prices. As an essential element of a NIEO, technology transfer was 
promoted by UNCTAD and deﬁned as “the transfer of systematic knowledge for the 
manufacture of a product, for the application of a process or for the rendering of a 
service and does not extend to the mere sale or lease of goods” (UNCTAD, 1985, 
Chap. 1, para. 1.2.). 
One of the criticisms of these relatively early concepts of technology transfer is that 
it was relatively static and one-dimensional, overlooking the relations between inter-
national measures of licencing, knowledge-sharing for manufacturing sectors, and the 
conditions of the potential recipient countries. A more recent document (UNCTAD, 
2019) stressed the interrelations between successful technology transfer, the absorp-
tive capacities in national or regional innovation systems, and local innovation as the 
outcome of technology transfer. Once STI systems have become effective, they may 
lead to a higher rate of innovation and at the same time improve capacities on the 
ground to absorb technological knowledge coming from outside. The same docu-
ment (UNCTAD, 2019, 31–34) emphasizes that the role of technology is no longer 
conﬁned to economic growth and social well-being, but is also pivotal in addressing 
global challenges, speciﬁcally climate change, global health and agriculture. 
The UNCTAD debate on the role of technology and the STI system in development 
has brought TA to the forefront. Assessing technological developments in terms of 
their capabilities to enhance economic and social growth in the Global South is 
pivotal in both choosing the targets of technology transfer and also investing in 
regional growth initiatives. As such, TA has been promoted, alongside foresight,2 
as the preferred research process to analyse the implications of new technologies, 
expand the national debates and promote policy options. This is clearly stated as an 
aspiration for the UN in its efforts to achieve its development goals (UN Economic 
and Social Council Resolution, 2019):
1 A huge body of literature discusses the only relative success of the policies for industrialisation 
by means of import substitutions. Notable exceptions are the Brazilian company Embrear, today 
one of the internationally leading airplane manufacturers, and the coal liquefaction cluster in South 
Africa. 
2 It should be noted that UNCTAD documents often use the terms TA and Foresight interchangeably. 
A recent project attempts to clarify the conceptual differences between TA and similar concepts for 
application in UNCTAD (See, https://unctad.org/meeting/launch-project-technology-assessment-
energy-and-agricultural-sectors-africa-accelerate).

3 TA and Global Challenges 
The role of TA in the development of resolutions to global challenges is still unclear 
as it is rarely directly referenced in the debates. This is not surprising since, as we have 
seen, TA is not often acknowledged within the global STI institutional setting. There 
is nevertheless evidence that TA has contributed to the analysis of global challenges 
in multiple ways. The examples of climate change and agriculture in developing 
countries are indicative of TA’s contribution. 
3.1 
Climate Change 
STI is seen as key to alleviating the impact and adapting to the consequences of 
climate change, which affects developing countries disproportionately. Although 
there is considerable debate on the role of technologies in dealing with climate 
change, these do not cover the economic and social context in which most developing 
countries function. Nevertheless, the climate goals of the Paris Agreement approved 
by the global community in 2015, such as improving energy access and social well-
being without a direct increase in the carbon footprint of society, are also on the 
agenda of developing countries. All signature countries have committed to contain 
greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep global warming below 1.5 or 2 degrees 
above pre-industrial times, and they have expressed their commitments in National 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) to United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC). In this manner, innovations in the energy ﬁeld can be 
seen as absolutely key to this process, ranging from carbon capture and storage, 
through large-scale renewable energies and green hydrogen production, to effective 
mini-grids fed by solar and/or wind energy, and improved cooking stoves to serve 
the energy needs of rural communities (see e.g. Chen, 2018). TA has a pivotal role to 
play in the development of innovative solutions and also in the overall improvement 
of the global debates. An example of the latter aim is the World Wide Views project 
that attempted a ﬁrst general methodology to initiate a global stakeholder dialogue 
on climate change (see Textbox 1).

Technology Assessment in a Multilateral Science, Technology …
37
Textbox 1: Worldwide consultation—World Wide Views on Climate 
Change 
The World Wide Views is a multisite citizen consultation methodology used 
for global citizen consultations. The core of the method is to have citizens at 
multiple sites debate the same policy-related questions on a given issue on 
the same day. The method was developed by the Danish Board of Technology 
and other partners in the World Wide Views Alliance, which was established 
for this purpose, prior to the climate COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. The 
aim was to develop a method that would provide participating citizens with 
balanced information and give them the opportunity to discuss the issues at 
hand with other citizens and at the same time produce results which are easily 
communicated to policymakers. 
World Wide Views projects have so far focused on the themes of Climate 
and Energy (10,000 participating citizens in 76 countries), Biodiversity (3000 
participating citizens in 25 countries) and Global Warming (4000 participating 
citizens in 38 countries). The questions put to the citizens are identiﬁed through 
a comprehensive consultation of policymakers and stakeholders worldwide in 
order to address the most pertinent, debated and disputed policy issues in 
the policy process which is addressed. The information material is designed 
to present citizens with the pros and cons of voting one way or another on 
the questions at hand. The information material is reviewed by a scientiﬁc 
advisory board and both the questions and information material is reviewed 
by citizen focus groups in different parts of the world prior to being ﬁnalized. 
Citizens discuss (with the help of professional moderators) and vote on the 
questions posed to them. The results feed directly into policy debates, which 
so far have been at UN conferences for Parties to the Climate and Biodiversity 
Conventions.

3.2 
Agriculture 
Another global challenge involving numerous and complex STI issues is that of 
agriculture. A functional agricultural sector is seen as a fundamental element for the 
economic transformation of developing countries, and particularly Least Developed 
Countries. In its Technology and Innovation Report 2010, UNCTAD asserted that 
improving agricultural performance in developing regions depends on technology 
and innovation and rising agricultural production. This topic is of special relevance 
for developing countries, as the primary sector is still fundamental both for local 
food security in the Global South, and to create opportunities for income generation 
through the export of increasingly higher-valued agricultural and agro-industrial

goods. Technology- and innovation-related challenges arise from the fact that the 
opportunities and risks of agricultural innovations have to be analysed against the 
fact that many small farmers and labourers depend on agriculture for their livelihood. 
Technological progress in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (see next 
section) is thus incompatible with technologies which drive further concentration 
processes forward and/or lead to the loss of income opportunities for labourers, 
especially women. 
This is an area that has already seen a lot of TA activity across the globe (e.g. 
see IIED, 2007). For instance, following standard participatory TA approaches, socio-
economic considerations have been incorporated in the analysis of GMO develop-
ment in India (see Textbox 2). This represents a strong indication that the need to 
undertake TA exercises with wide stakeholder consultation in STI developments has 
been accepted by the decision-making bodies of the country. 
Textbox 2: New participatory methodologies—Socioeconomic (SE) 
Consideration of Living Modiﬁed Organisms in India 
A country-wide consultation exercise on socioeconomic considerations of 
Living Modiﬁed Organisms (LMOs), funded by United Nations Environment 
Programme, Global Environment Facility, was run by the Research and Infor-
mation Systems for Developing Countries (RIS) and overseen by the Ministry 
of Environment, Forestry and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Government of 
India. 
The aim of the project was to develop guidelines and methodologies for 
SE assessment for LMOs as envisaged under Article 26.1 of the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety. It involved the creation of a steering committee with 
experts from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, the Indian Council 
for Social Science Research and a number of state agricultural universities. 
The consultation exercise that employed survey and workshop methodologies 
involved small and medium farmers from across the country on a number of 
crop and trait examples. 
Based on the analysis of the needs of farmers and the opinions of the expert 
community, the project developed a SE assessment methodology that was 
presented and adopted by the MoEF&CC. As a result, the moratorium on 
GM crops in India (active since 2010) continues. The guidelines and method-
ologies in decision-making on GMOs are discussed at the Ad Hoc Technical 
Expert Group (AHTEG) under the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and repre-
sents powerful empirical TA research toward the effort to ﬁnd consensus 
on what factors/elements should be taken into account for Socio-Economic 
Considerations of LMOs.

In another instance, the standard TA methodology of a Citizens’ Jury has 
been successfully applied to agricultural GMO developments in a Low Middle 
Income Country (see Textbox 3). This is another example of how well-established 
TA methodologies from developed countries can be used in vastly different 
socio-economic contexts with equally fruitful results. 
Textbox 3: Participatory assessment—Citizens’ Jury on GMOs in Mali 
A Citizens’ Jury on Genetically Modiﬁed Organisms (GMOs) was organised 
by the government (the Regional Assembly) of Sikasso, sponsored by the Swiss 
Development Cooperation and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A 
steering committee consisting of representatives of ﬁfteen local, national and 
international institutions (government, civil society, research, farmer organi-
sations, IIED…) was responsible for the design, organisation and facilitation 
of the deliberative process. 
The Citizens’ Jury was designed to allow ordinary farmers, both men and 
women, to make policy recommendations after considering expert evidence 
from different sources. Its main objective was to create a safe space for commu-
nication and action in which small-, medium- and large-scale farmers could 
better understand the risks and advantages of GMOs, confront different view-
points in favor of and against GMOs and formulate recommendations for 
policies on GMOs and the future of farming in Mali. 
The Citizens’ Jury recommendation to delay the approval of national legis-
lation needed for the introduction of GM crops and initiate a debate on the 
future of agriculture was acted upon by the Malian National Assembly. In addi-

Overall, it is clear that when it comes to global challenges, TA studies and standard 
TA methodologies can be used in many cultural and socio-economic contexts. The 
examples show that TA has already been applied successfully at both national and 
global levels. In all cases, there was little to no adaptation of the standard developed 
country approach, thus denoting the capacity of TA to transcend borders.

4 Technology Assessment and the Sustainable Development 
Goals 
A particular case of interest for the potential function of TA at the global level is that 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, adopted by the United Nations’ General Assembly in 2015, provides 
the main description of the challenges that humanity is faced with. This is broken 
down into seventeen SDGs, representing the aspirations of the world to achieve a 
sustainable and peaceful future for everyone. Each SDG is divided further into a set 
of speciﬁc targets (169 in total) that deal with speciﬁc issues in terms of poverty 
alleviation, improvements of health and well-being, inequality reduction, tackling 
climate change, reversing environmental pollution, etc. Figure 1 provides an overview 
of the SDGs. 
It is worth noting that the development of the SDGs has been based on a set of 
speciﬁc principles. These take into consideration that grand challenges are universal 
(affecting all countries), interlinked (cannot be solved in isolation) and socially inclu-
sive (all citizens are involved). In a more detailed description, the guiding design 
principles are (United Nations, 2015): 
Universality: The new agenda is applicable to all country typologies, not only 
to developing countries. The SDGs allow for the concept of nationally adapted and 
differentiated approaches for implementing what is seen as a common and collective 
responsibility. 
Integrated approach: The new agenda denotes that it is clearly insufﬁcient to 
achieve the SDGs on a goal-by-goal or target-by-target basis. The SDGs require 
an integrated approach that identiﬁes sets of development interventions that can 
unleash progress across multiple goals and targets—across sectors—at the same time. 
While accountability will continue to reside in a particular sector, understanding how

41
to promote an integrated approach and policy coherence in order to inform better 
planning through cross-sectoral collaboration is key to success. 
Leaving no one behind: The 2030 Agenda strongly embodies the idea of no-
one left behind, and this is expressed in various SDG goals and targets which aim at 
universal achievement (e.g. zero targets: eradicate extreme poverty, eradicate hunger; 
systematic use of disaggregated data; quality outcomes based approach; and norma-
tive frameworks). This will require countries to work to reach the last mile. Coun-
tries will need to re-evaluate their approaches, development interventions and costs 
associated with leaving no-one behind. 
The SDGs are therefore aspirations that have been translated into speciﬁc goals. 
However, the means through which to achieve these goals are not described in 
adequate detail. SDG No. 9, “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and 
sustainable industrialization and foster innovation”, is the only one that directly deals 
with STI, but most of the SDGs require STI developments to achieve their goals. TA 
has a role to play in any effort to use STI in achieving the SDGs. Considering the wide 
spectrum of possibilities for implementing TA processes in this area, one can draw 
preliminary ideas from similar disciplines and their relationships to the SDGs. For 
instance, the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) has accepted 
that the SDGs can be used as a framework for the integration of diverse assessment 
disciplines. In its view, SDGs can be incorporated into impact assessment in various 
ways (IAIA, 2019; Partidario & Verheem, 2019), e.g.: 
• Use the global SDG framework as an instrument to increase the relevance 
of impact assessment in national development policy, programme and project 
decisions. 
• Seek harmonization of national impact assessment regulations with SDG-inspired 
development policies and practice, ensuring that relevant criteria are used in 
decision-making processes. 
• Support the adoption or adaptation of impact assessment guidelines to incorporate 
SDG principles and concepts; develop sector-based impact assessment guidelines 
aligned with the SDGs; and generate well-documented case studies that highlight 
the links between impact assessment and the SDGs. 
• Translate SDGs into criteria that are speciﬁc to a particular project or plan context; 
addressing the critical risks and limits of acceptable change in the potentially 
affected ecosystems and communities. 
• Avoid being over-rigid or overly prescriptive: not all SDG targets are relevant for 
all contexts. Considering sustainable development issues in the local setting will 
simplify the impact assessment scope. 
At the same time, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has acknowledged the need 
to use the innovation capabilities of the fourth industrial revolution to achieve sustain-
able industrial development in accordance with the SDGs. The WEF’s White Paper 
on the sustainability of production systems within the fourth industrial revolution has 
identiﬁed a number of relevant technological developments that must be assessed in 
terms of the SDGs (WEF, 2018). Examples are given in the areas of automotives, 
electronics, food and beverages, and textiles and footwear. Each of these areas is

42
M. Ladikas and A. Stamm
reviewed in terms of sustainable innovation potential that can be measured against 
the SDGs. 
These are also interesting possibilities for TA. The exact positioning of TA in the 
process of achieving the SDGs depends on accurate identiﬁcation of those SDGs that 
provide a useful reference framework to judge the impact of technological develop-
ments, and also on the availability of evidence at the global level that allows for a 
meaningful assessment process (Ladikas et al., 2018). 
5 Technology Assessment in Developing Countries 
When attempting to apply TA processes in the context and realities of devel-
oping countries, one must consider carefully the challenges that such undertakings 
involve. Current TA methods are based on experiences gathered in industrialised 
countries that naturally present great contextual differences to developing countries 
(see also Srinivas and van Est, this volume). For instance, the national innovation 
systems or production systems of developing countries are often much weaker, while 
their economies are much less diversiﬁed and often dominated by sectors that are 
technology-poor. The Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD), 
including both public and private R&D spending, shows major differences. For 
instance in 2018, High Income Countries (HICs) invested 2.59% of their GDP in 
GERD, Upper Middle Income Countries (UMICs), including China, 1.64%, while 
Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) 
spent only about 0.53% and 0.17% of their GDPs, respectively (World Bank, 2021). 
Other important indicators of the health of the national innovation system show 
similar great disparities (see Table 1). For instance, in terms of scientiﬁc publications 
LDCs have an astonishing 1/178 ratio to HICs. This is a very important indicator 
for TA since the amount and quality of the national scientiﬁc production are crucial 
for the quality of the assessment. Interesting here is that, as with many other STI 
indicators, China is by far the most productive MIC, which brings it into equal footing 
with HICs.
Further disparities between developed and developing countries show that the 
number of researchers in R&D per million population is 4116 in a HIC, but 737 in 
MICs, while there is no data available for LICs (World Development Indicators 2021). 
In addition, public funding for higher education that can produce future researchers is 
low and there is a constant “brain-drain” situation that depletes the limited numbers 
of researchers emerging from LICs. The situation is similar in terms of innovation, 
whereby research in the private sector is very limited, and most active industrial 
research entities are subsidiaries of larger foreign corporations. 
A clear exception to the general low level of STI research capabilities in MICs and 
LICs is the multilateral research institutes, such as the International Rice Research 
Institute in the Philippines, the International Livestock Research Institute in Kenya 
and Ethiopia, or the International Potato Centre in Peru. Donor-funded research 
centres also offer exceptional research capabilities, for instance, the West African

TA must therefore accommodate to the local context, and function according to 
local needs and capabilities (e.g. see UK Parliamentary Ofﬁce of S&T, 2011). Lack 
of research capabilities in many countries signiﬁes a lack of quality scientiﬁc data 
on which to base the required assessment, but also a potential lack of experts to 
participate in it. At the same time, stakeholder participation, as it is undertaken in 
current TA processes, assumes an active civil society and a culture of non-restricted 
public debate that might not be the case in many MICs or LICs. However, this 
might not be seen as a lack of democratic credentials in the country. There are many 
reasons for a diminished debate or active civil society that range from cultural norms 
to funding prerogatives (Wakeford & Pimbert, 2004). In any case, the limitations 
faced by TA due to the speciﬁc national context will deﬁnitely restrict its usual scope 
and functions, but this should not be seen as a prohibitive setting. 
Another aspect that should be taken into consideration when attempting to adopt 
TA practices in the developing country context is the differences in technology adop-
tion processes. STI-intense economies are also early adopters of STI developments, 
since they base much of their economic success in competitive advantages deriving 
from speedy assimilation of new technologies. Most developing countries are late 
adopters, as they lack the structures for early assessment. This is where TA can play 
an important role, by functioning as a “horizon scanning” process that can identify 
STI developments that offer particular opportunities in the less developed economy 
context. Such developments might be akin to what is termed “frugal innovation”, 
whereby simple or low-tech innovations can be more attuned to the needs of devel-
oping countries and thus much easier to assimilate in the existing context (Lelivend & 
Pesa, 2020).

6 Discussion: Future Challenges for Technology 
Assessment at the Global Level 
As described above, multilateral STI analysis and policy advice is required to 
deal with many global challenges that face humanity. There is a need to generate 
new knowledge on the beneﬁts and risks of STI developments and provide new 
perspectives and institutional structures in global governance. TA as a concept of 
problem-oriented research and policy advice is ideally placed for this purpose and 
has recently drawn interest from international organisations such as OECD and the 
United Nations.3 
Beyond the basic institutional arrangements to develop a global TA, there are 
many additional topics to be addressed, which could be structured around four main 
areas: 
Agenda- and priority-setting: There is no clear deﬁnition of what should be seen 
as grand, global or societal challenges which would need a fast and responsible 
response from STI. As not all topics can be addressed simultaneously, mechanisms 
would have to be found to deﬁne global TA agendas and priorities. There might be 
different ways of agenda and priority setting, for instance, and they may be either 
problem- and goal-driven, or science-driven. The SDGs provide the set of objectives 
to which the international community has committed and where STI solutions have 
to contribute. Ground-breaking innovations offer both opportunities and risks, which 
would have to be assessed internationally, e.g. artiﬁcial intelligence, or CRISP-CAS9 
techniques. 
Funding and spending arrangements: Depending on the challenge to be addressed 
and the underlying scientiﬁc basis, responsible and effective TA can in some cases 
be based on meta-level analyses of existing scientiﬁc work (as in the case of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)). However, this may be different 
when technology paths are relatively recent and the body of scientiﬁc literature is not 
exhaustive. Need may arise to conduct limited original research, which would raise 
questions regarding funding and spending arrangements to assure both effectiveness 
and equity. 
Stakeholder involvement: Literature on TA indicates that good TA practices must 
involve different stakeholder groups, be participatory and interactive. The relevance 
and feasibility of this approach for multilateral processes should be assessed in more 
detail. For most current TA processes, parliaments are the clearly targeted addressee, 
as parliaments decide upon the legal framework under which technologies develop. 
However, there are other actors to be considered, which also decide about rules and 
regulations (governments and courts), and the social acceptance of technology paths 
(trades unions, civil society groups). How to effectively reach different stakeholder 
groups at a global level is still rather uncharted territory.

7 Conclusions: A Model for Technology Assessment 
at Global Level 
The TA community has discussed extensively the various modes of institutionali-
sation of TA (Liebert & Schmidt, 2010; Decker & Ladikas, 2004). These discus-
sions have focussed on speciﬁc national contexts whereby TA has been developed 
in the past forty years, mainly in western European countries (Hennen & Ladikas, 
2019). Recently, there has been considerable interest in how TA could be institu-
tionalised at a multilateral or global level (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019) and from the four 
models discussed in the conclusions of this volume two ﬁt well within the global STI 
governance reality: 
Institutional Networks across borders 
To stimulate the internationalization of TA, existing national TA institutes may collab-
orate across national borders on various TA-related topics. This so-called Institu-
tional Network option aims to establish an expert-and-participatory TA capability by 
connecting an appropriate set of independent, non-partisan and non-proﬁt organiza-
tions in an international network. Examples of existing networks are EPTA and the 
globalTA network. Cooperation between institutes may vary from bilateral cooper-
ation to cooperation on a global scale, like for example in the World Wide Views on 
Global Warming (WWViews) project. 
Global TA linked to a global Decision-Making Body 
National parliamentary TA organizations are often linked to a decision-making body, 
such as the parliament. This Decision-Making Body option can also be implemented 
on the global level, in particular with regard to UN institutes. In the ﬁeld of global 
warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an example of 
this model. 
Both models are viable possibilities for a TA linked to international governance 
structures. We have seen that TA-linked activities are evident in a number of bilateral 
organisational settings, so long as they focus on STI issues. And this is perhaps the 
pivotal aspect of any form of TA that transcends national boundaries. Analysis of 
STI issues for the development of policy advice can hardly be done without some 
form of TA methodology, whether of the classical expert types or the more recent 
interactive ones. Nevertheless, one should risk a prediction of an ideal organisational 
structure for TA, if it is to function at a purely global level and applied to global 
challenges. As the Decision-Making body model suggests, this could be similar to 
the existing IPCC structure (see also Ashworth and Clarke this volume). 
The IPCC is an excellent example of global science for policy advice, with some 
observers considering it “the largest exercise in scientiﬁc cooperation ever embarked 
upon” (Pearce et al., 2018, 127). It has worked as an institutional role model which 
helped form the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in 2012 (Beck et al., 2014). Researchers and observers 
have proposed an institutional setting for several other environmental challenges, e.g.

46
M. Ladikas and A. Stamm
food, water and anti-microbial resistance. There are four largely undisputed elements 
of success in the IPCC model of scientiﬁc policy advice (Pearce et al., 2018): 
• Most of the work is done by a huge number of volunteer scientists from different 
parts of the world whose work is synthesized in reports of the three Working 
Groups (WGs): physical science (WG1), social and ecological impacts and 
adaptation (WG2), mitigation options (WG3). 
• The IPCC has pioneered new ways of assessing scientiﬁc knowledge across a 
broad range of disciplines and interconnected topics. 
• The ﬁndings of both its report outlines and ﬁnal content are approved by 
government representatives, giving them high political authority. 
• The high visibility of the work of the IPCC has contributed to keeping climate 
change on the international policy agenda over several decades. 
The speciﬁc governance of the IPCC is the outcome of institutional co-evolution 
of the international climate policy regime and the scientiﬁc advisory sub-system. In 
1986, the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases was set up by the World Meteo-
rological Organization (WMO), the Environmental Program of the United Nations 
(UNEP) and the International Council of Scientiﬁc Unions. It soon became clear that 
this group was too small and underfunded to fulﬁl a meaningful purpose. Following 
complex negotiations between WMO and the US Government, the road was paved 
for the creation of the IPCC, which materialized in 1988, under the auspices of WMO 
and UNEP. Shortly thereafter, in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted by UN member countries. Between 
1990 and 2022, the IPCC has published six Assessment Reports and a number of 
reports on speciﬁc topics. 
Considering the relevance of the IPCC experience to a global TA exercise, some 
debates around the IPCC governance model seem of special relevance: 
• How to prioritize questions around new and emerging technologies in a global 
science exercise? Critical debates have formed around the focus of the IPCC on 
precise climate change modelling, mitigation actions and the related risk that 
adaptation to already manifest climate change would not receive the necessary 
attention. 
This question is the essence of TA, and its main function as a means to assess the 
impact of speciﬁc technology developments in society, economy and the environ-
ment. As we have seen, global challenges require new STI approaches that can be 
applied equally well in different geographical, cultural and economic contexts. TA 
has been performing such comparative studies at multilateral level for a number 
of years and can effectively upgrade its methodologies to a global level of analysis 
(see the example of World Wide Views above, and Ladikas et al., 2015). 
• How to assure a good mix of disciplines? As the initial focus of IPCC was very 
much on modelling future climate change, physical and other natural sciences 
were long seen as being over-represented at the expense of social sciences beyond 
economics.

Technology Assessment in a Multilateral Science, Technology …
47
TA is a multidisciplinary approach that has successfully integrated social 
science, natural science and engineering methodologies under its remit. A stan-
dard TA analysis will use knowledge created by any relevant discipline on the issue 
under consideration, and the ﬁnal analysis will be based on multidisciplinary anal-
ysis. This is also evident in the expectation that ﬁnal reports and policy options 
development are co-authored by representatives of all disciplines involved in the 
analysis (Hennen et al., 2004). 
• How to assure an adequate representation of different world regions? Corbera et al. 
(2016) found that around 80% of authors and reviewers of successive assessment 
reports produced by the IPCC were from OECD countries. This leads to different 
priorities and assessments, such as framing Southern forests as “empty” spaces 
available to suck up the Global North’s carbon pollution (Pearce et al., 2018, 126). 
As we have discussed above, TA is mainly active in western, developed coun-
tries, with a clear presence in every STI-intensive economy. It has nevertheless 
been applied successfully in a variety of developing country settings and has shown 
full capability to incorporate low income and low STI intensity contexts in its 
methodologies. This is particularly true for the interactive modes of TA, whereby 
wide stakeholder consultation is a prerequisite for the analysis and development 
of technology roadmaps (Ely et al., 2011). 
• How inclusive or restrictive should assessments be conceptualized? For example, 
large-scale reforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
can be assessed as a feasible climate change mitigation option via negative emis-
sions, but all feasible trade-offs cannot realistically be assessed in the same 
report. 
TA offers an established process to research and identify the scope of the 
prospective exercises and determine which technologies are sufﬁciently relevant 
to be put on the agenda and assigned high priority. The exact delimination of what 
should be the object of the TA process will be based on the analysis of social, 
economic or environmental challenges to which the technological solutions should 
respond, either as a stand-alone solution or as an element of a comprehensive 
package of policy measures (Buetschi et al., 2004). 
• How to balance global vs local: “between scientiﬁc knowledge that speaks of 
abstract global systems to a global audience, and knowledge that pertains more 
closely to local settings where the drivers and impacts of global change are more 
directly experienced” (Pearce et al., 2018, 128). 
This is also an issue that TA has been dealing with in depth. Balancing out the 
needs of regional development as part of national-level development is a common 
focus of TA exercises, while more often than not, this upgrades to international (e.g. 
European) versus regional balancing. As such, TA has identiﬁed the need to translate 
scientiﬁc knowledge to lay language and has developed methodologies that aim at 
converting abstract theories to applicable technologies at local level (Hennen, 2002). 
Overall, TA can make signiﬁcant contributions to the international STI governance 
system. These contributions can take many forms, ranging from the establishment of 
a TA-like structure such as the IPCC (see also Ashworth and Clarke, this volume),

48
M. Ladikas and A. Stamm
or as part of the existing UN system, like UNCTAD. The future form will depend 
on many external factors, prominent amongst them being the political will to create 
such a global policy advisory institution. We have shown that TA has the experience 
and the tools to work effectively at a global level, which is evident in the existing TA 
activities that are undertaken, unwittingly or not, in many multilateral organisations. 
The TA community should respond to the tasks that global challenges are bringing, 
and the needs of the global community to promote common STI approaches to deal 
with them.

Challenges for Global TA

Globalisation as Reﬂexive 
Modernisation—Implications for S&T 
Governance 
Leonhard Hennen and Rinie van Est 
1 
Introduction 
“Globalisation” refers to a process of growing interconnectedness of economies and 
affects trade relations, production chains and labour markets. However, globalisa-
tion is about more than economics. It includes signiﬁcant socio-cultural changes, 
which induce as many challenges to policymaking and governance as the “global 
economy”. These changes are technologically fostered by increasing options for 
real-time exchange of data, news, money, chats, advertisements and videos about 
all kind of subjects, from everyday problems and individual preferences regarding 
fashion, to problems of international justice and socio-economic inequality or the 
global condition of our environment. The changes connected with these develop-
ments have repercussions on every citizen of the world. The effects will be different 
for each individual; some effects will be welcome, others may cause conﬂicts, social 
upheaval or crises, sometimes of a global nature such as global warming or the 
COVID-19 pandemic, each of which has speciﬁc local and personal consequences. 
Thus, globalisation changes our life world and through this our reference system for 
individual and political decision-making. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a frame for more speciﬁc contributions 
provided in this volume on governance issues in science and technology (S&T), 
and in particular the role of Technology Assessment (TA), by giving an overview

of developments in society, economy and culture that are related to the concept of 
“globalisation”. Thus, by clarifying the meaning of globalisation, the needs, oppor-
tunities and challenges for developing global strategies, procedures and institutions 
of TA will be set against a general background of global interconnectedness and 
change. Technology plays an irrevocable role in this. “The pace of globalisation 
and that of technological change have in fact been strictly interrelated and, from 
a long-term perspective, it appears less important to establish which one should 
be considered responsible for triggering the other rather than to establish that they 
mutually enforced each other.” (Archibugi & Iammarino, 2002) S&T are thus drivers 
as well as mediators and facilitators of globalisation. At the same time, they are a 
source of global problems and challenges as well as options to address these. In 
both respects, S&T are at the centre of global societal and political debates about the 
needs and opportunities for global governance and world politics. We will touch on 
the role of S&T when going through the history of globalisation and expanding on 
the main features and problems of our current global situation. 
By a tour of the central issues touched upon in the discourse on globalisation, 
we hope to clarify the broad scope of questions and problems that challenge the 
necessary global attempts to govern the process of globalisation. Approaches to and 
concepts of science-based advice to policymaking such as TA are part and parcel of 
governance on the national level (Hennen & Ladikas, 2019; STOA,  2012; van  Est,  
2019). We argue that it is necessary for this policy intelligence practice to transfer its 
methods and institutional setting to a global level. This is a challenge in itself, and 
what kind of solutions will be found remains open. The main task is to support the 
reﬂexivity of global governance, its ability to learn and critically reﬂect on currently 
established routines, as well as to take into account uncertainties of knowledge, and 
ambiguities when taking action. 
In the case of ambiguities, it is necessary to include a broad scope of differing 
and sometimes conﬂicting values in the process of identifying problems as well as 
viable and effective policies. The values to be taken into account imply a broad 
scope of accounts of what has and can be done, and a broad scope of visions of what 
the meaning and future of a “common good” at a global level might be. TA at a 
national level works in an inclusive mode, by trying to provide for participation of 
all relevant voices in deliberation on policymaking. To do this, TA needs to rely on 
and address itself to an attentive public and an active civil society as central parts of 
its “habitat” (Hennen & Nierling, 2015), which at best is in the making on a global 
level. Each contribution to this volume discusses different aspects of the challenge 
for S&T governance set by globalisation. This essay aims to make clear that the 
latest stage of what has been called “reﬂexive modernisation”, which we understand 
as globalisation, needs “reﬂexivity” in answers to its challenges. 
The paper starts with a brief discussion of the long history of globalisation in order 
to clarify what is characteristic of our current stage of globality. It then outlines some 
central features of what globalisation currently comprises and sketches globalisation 
as reﬂexive modernisation. Next, we present the ambiguities—in terms of goods and 
bads—of globalisation and the associated challenges of a “cosmopolitan” perspective 
on governance. We do this through a discussion of three ﬁelds or dimensions of

globalisation. The ﬁnal section discusses the relevance and implications of these 
trends for global governance and the role of scientiﬁc policy advice.

Globalisation—A Modern Phenomenon with a History 
Globalisation encompasses a complex set of societal dimensions and thus is subject 
also to scholarly debates on its sources, drivers and features, as well as its meaning for 
and bearing on the future of culture and politics. Such controversies include debates 
on whether what we experience as globalisation is altogether new. Without being 
able to enter deep into this discussion, we brieﬂy outline the history of globalisation 
since this will aid understanding of what it means to be “globalised” nowadays. 
Pre-modern globalisation 
Some hold that globalisation can be dated to antique times since in these pre-modern 
periods we can also ﬁnd many examples of cross-border exchange or mutual inﬂu-
ence in cultural, economic and political terms. Pre-modern Egyptian, Persian, Indian, 
Mongolian, Chinese and Roman empires connected great and culturally diverse terri-
tories or regions under one power regime, implying intensiﬁed economic and cultural 
exchange (Abu-Lughod, 1989). The development and global expansion of world 
religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam) can be regarded as a uniﬁ-
cation of world views and moralities held in different regions of the world. Some 
authors regard certain common features—such as individual ethical self-reﬂection— 
as a possible fundament of cosmopolitanism and moral mutual understanding (see 
the debate about the “axial age”, for an overview Bellah & Joas, 2012). Many of the 
fundaments of Western modernity are based in cultural achievements from other parts 
of the world and have been adopted in Europe as an effect of pre-modern interchange: 
“Coins, paper money and complex bureaucracy were legacies from China. Monetary 
policy and commercial credit came from Chinese and Arab mini-globalizations. The 
Arabic numeral system allowed double-entry bookkeeping, essential in accounting, 
while maritime regulation came from the East. These developments are central to 
systems such as capitalism and bureaucracy that deﬁne modernity and modern glob-
alization.” (Martell, 2017, 61) Thus, modern globalisation owes a lot to pre-modern 
cross-border and cross-cultural exchange, although it goes far beyond historic phases 
in terms of its scope and the intensity of interconnectedness. 
Capitalist globalisation 
In addition, the modern state of globalisation is based in fundamentally new material 
and cultural fundaments of modern societies—such as rationalisation of world views 
and modes of social integration, democratic and authoritarian modes of government, 
individualism, as well as the market economy, industrialisation and capitalist modes 
of production. The global spread and relevance of these features are connected with 
the European-driven colonialist expansion of circles of political and economic activ-
ities beyond regional boundaries since the ﬁfteenth century. It presents a history of

56
L. Hennen and R. van Est
military violence and occupation, of political, economic, cultural and religious domi-
nation and of human exploitation, including slavery. This repressive and Eurocentric 
process led to the fostering of a modern view of humanity and a universalistic mode 
of morality. The ideas of universal human rights and individual freedom, as reﬂected 
in moral and philosophical thinking of the European enlightenment (Rousseau, Kant, 
Locke), are closely linked to perception and awareness of the multitude of cultures 
and ways of life that was made possible by the connection of remote areas of the globe 
driven by European political and economic interests and legitimised by ideologies 
of European supremacy (see, e.g. Powell, 2014).1 
Following Wallerstein’s (1980) account of the “world system”, globalisation is 
an effect of capitalism, since striving for capital valorisation has an impetus in itself 
to expand the scope of markets and investment opportunities. Thus, today’s global 
system largely dates back to the sixteenth century when European capitalist actors 
started to expand their reach to the Americas and Asia. These transatlantic and 
Paciﬁc explorations were enabled by signiﬁcant progress in navigation technologies. 
The next globalisation wave in the nineteenth century was also driven by economic 
motives and supported by new technological developments. The intensiﬁed inter-
European and transcontinental interchanges in the area of “industrialisation” were 
driven by new mass production technologies. New transport technologies such as 
railways, steam ships and later aeroplanes also improved the means, reach and speed 
of interchange. This wave of globalisation, which was closely linked to the struggle 
between the colonial ambitions of Western countries, also introduced new conﬂicts 
in social relations and politics, as was reﬂected in the Communist Manifesto of Karl 
Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848 (Marx & Engels 1998). Their analysis is not too 
far from descriptions of the dynamics of globalisation which we face nowadays (Katz, 
2001). The Communist Manifesto describes the liberation of economic and cultural 
activities from local embedding and the resulting “interdependencies”. Domination 
and exploitation came about at the same time with opening up from local or national 
“seclusion” and “self-sufﬁciency”. 
The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of unprecedented economic 
interchange and interdependence. The First World War destroyed the level of forma-
tion of a world economy, and it took until the 1970s to reach the same level (Strik-
werda, 2016). With World War I, the area of economic interchange experienced a 
national backlash but nevertheless and ironically provided the start for a new “world 
system” (Wallerstein), but with the United States rather than Europe at the centre. 
It is possible to speak of globalisation since World War I in terms of geopolitical 
thinking and attempts to establish global institutions of governance. As Eric Hobs-
bawm put it, the world, the globe, instead of nation states and national economies is 
the “primary functional unit” to refer to economically and politically (Hobsbawm, 
1998, 30).
1 A comparable “de-nationalisation” of world views had been observed in the late Roman empire, 
with the dominant philosophical-religious school of the Stoa establishing “humanity” (enclosing 
the whole “oikumene”—the then known inhabited world) as the reference for moral reﬂection. 

Globalisation as Reﬂexive Modernisation—Implications …
57
With the end of the Soviet empire in 1991 and the end of the Cold War, the 
bipolarized geopolitical shape of the world dissolved and Western Liberalism with 
its democracy and market economy appeared to be the only alternative (which made 
some observers speak—prematurely—of the “end of history”, Fukuyama, 1992). The 
apparent “victory” of the Western system together with options provided by digital 
technologies gave rise to the notion of a globalised world in terms of socio-political 
order, as well as socio-cultural closing of ranks (“the global village”, McLuhan, 
1962). At the same time, people became aware of global problems, such as global 
economic crisis and climate change. It was these developments that made the term 
“globalisation” a salient subject of political and scholarly debate in the 1980s and 
1990s (Martell, 2017, Introduction). 
Although colonialism no longer exists (in its historic manner of political expan-
sion), and power relations have shifted signiﬁcantly since the nineteenth century, 
economic interests and the capitalist economy still foster global interdependencies 
and establish new centres and peripheries in terms of economic power and beneﬁts. 
Globalisation can be regarded as a project driven by economic motives and to a great 
part facilitated by technological progress. 
This is not an exhaustive characterisation of today’s global state of affairs and 
of the variety of political, cultural and economic aspects that have been the subject 
of scholarly debate on the push of globalisation since the 1980s. Those discussions 
are busy reﬂecting on the new aspects and features that discern the recent wave of 
expanded global interchange and interdependence from historic phases of globali-
sation. Whilst we cannot go into the details of these controversial debates here, it is 
necessary to develop some systematic understanding of what “Globalisation” means 
or encompasses in order to better understand the need for and the options of global 
technology governance and the role of TA.

Modern Globalisation and Reﬂexive Modernisation 
What is “modern” about “modern globalisation”? In this section, we consider the 
question of what, behind all the different features related to globalisation, can be 
regarded as the core characteristics of our current state of global interconnectedness. 
Current transnational interrelations show more expanded global outreach than 
historical modes of transnational interconnectedness. Changes in production and 
trade as well as politics or culture in one part of the world may have repercussions 
beyond local, national or regional spheres. This implies interdependency of national 
economies and politics, including in terms of the unintended side-effects of activities 
such as global environmental problems or global risks (see Sect. 4.3). What is also 
apparent is the speed and intensity of the exchange of knowledge and data. Global 
communication today means real-time communication, ranging from huge ﬁnancial 
transactions to being connected live with all kinds of political or cultural events in all 
parts of the world, and the possibility of posting your own thoughts and beliefs about 
the latter to the “world” via social media. Ideas developed in one part of the globe can

58
L. Hennen and R. van Est
easily travel to any other part. The distinction between local and domestic experiences 
and the global arena is losing relevance, and the impacts that the local might have 
on the distanced and vice versa are magniﬁed, and its effects are accelerated. 
Thus, the core of modern globalisation might be caught by the term “supra terri-
torialism” (Scholte, 2005), which means that territory no longer makes a distinctive 
difference, and social activities are not deﬁned or bound by territories, due to the 
shrinking of time and space based on technologies of exchange. Proximate local 
issues and problems are caused by distant decisions or developments, and call for 
a non-parochial perspective to address them. The relevance of local connections 
remains, but people’s working relations, their private social networks, their welfare 
and ultimately also their identities are no longer mostly deﬁned by their local or 
national environments, structures and institutions, but are dependent on—and partly 
an effect of—global interconnectedness and interdependencies. This means that 
everyday life is increasingly determined by structures set up by transnational corpo-
rations and policies, and problems of global relevance (such as climate change), as 
well as by lifestyles whose element and forms are deﬁned and shared globally. 
Contemporary globalisation is thus accompanied by a consciousness of glob-
alisation that manifests itself both in the global discourse as well as in everyday 
experiences, apprehension and expressions of globalisation in all layers of society. 
We are not only objectively globalised, but we are also becoming increasingly aware 
that local or national boundaries neither restrict our activities nor protect us to the 
extent they might have in former times. Because of the increasing interdependence 
and consciousness of the global whole (see, e.g. Robertson, 1992), globalisation has 
become a “new symbolic experience” (Martell, 2017, 53) embedded in our identities 
and the ways we understand the world and our future (for the good or the bad), and 
thus is referred to in almost every discourse on politics, culture and economy. 
From a sociological perspective, all this is not in the ﬁrst line based on some inde-
pendent dynamics of trans-local interchange but are fundamentally features related 
to modernity. For Anthony Giddens, who provided one of the ﬁrst inﬂuential soci-
ological accounts of globalisation (Giddens, 1990), globalisation is a feature of the 
general process of modernisation (and vice versa), which is characterised by “dis-
embedding” social relations, and reﬂexivity of social institutions. Social activities 
are increasingly dependent on remote activities, provisions and institutions—not 
as a result of globalisation as such—but as a result of different dimensions of the 
process of modernisation, i.e. rationalisation, scientiﬁcation, devaluation of tradi-
tional knowledge, trans-local division of labour, capitalist market economies and 
monetarisation. Thus, the reorganisation of the social dimension of space and time 
which appear to be an effect or the essence of globalisation is basically a feature of 
modernity. When regarding socialisation (the forces of integrating and constituting 
societies) at its core as a problem of organisation of time and space, it is apparent 
that “… in the modern era, the level of time space distanciation is much higher than 
in any previous period, and the relations between local and distant social forms and 
events become correspondingly ‘stretched’.” (Giddens, 1990: 64). What the previous 
section described as a feature of globalisation—the “dis-embedding” of the local and

59
its dependency on widely dispersed structures in time- and space—is for Giddens an 
aspect of “reﬂexive modernisation”. 
Contemporary globalisation is the latest consequence of this process. It is charac-
terised by “intensiﬁcation of worldwide social relations which link distant localities 
in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles 
away and vice versa” (Giddens, 1990, 64). This implies economic dependencies, but 
might simultaneously bring about contradictory cultural shifts. Giddens believes that 
a global “stretch” of social relations might loosen the mental bounds to socio-cultural 
and political dimensions of the nation state and at the same time “be causally involved 
with the intensifying of more localised national sentiments” (ibid., 65). Modernity 
is not only a structural process but also affects individual and social identities which 
become “a reﬂexive project” (ibid., 124) in the sense that they are no longer pre-
stabilised by local traditions and commitments, but have to be constructed individ-
ually, and become a subject of “life politics” (Giddens, 1991). This might lead to 
cosmopolitan attitudes as well as to a reafﬁrmation and demarcation of group identi-
ties, the conﬂictive effects of which we nowadays see in fundamentalism, nationalism 
and identity politics. 
Giddens discerns four dimensions of globalisation: the nation state system, the 
world capitalist economy, the world military order and international division of labour 
(Giddens, 1990, 70f.). The division of labour dimension refers to industrialisation— 
transformation of nature, development of a created environment (ibid.: 59)—and 
includes a focus on production technologies and the environmentally negative conse-
quences. In this volume and in TA, we are concerned with S&T in general and its 
socio-cultural meanings. Cultural globalisation is driven by communication tech-
nologies (from letterpress to modern communication technologies), which, according 
to Giddens, are the driving forces behind central features of modernity such as social 
expansion, loss of traditions and local perspectives, rationalisation and reﬂexivity. 
At this point, we arrive at what the terms “reﬂexive” or “second” modernity, as 
applied by Giddens, Ulrich Beck and others (see Beck et al., 1994) actually mean: 
the confrontation of (ﬁrst) modernity with its “non-intended” consequences and 
side-effects, as well as the process of applying reﬂexivity and critical scrutiny—the 
heritage of enlightenment—to the fundaments of modernity itself. This includes the 
promise of scientiﬁc rationalisation (and its material outcome: modern technology) 
as a guarantee for increasing social wealth and security. The success of modernisation 
in bringing about relative wealth for a greater part of society and increasing the reach 
and effectiveness of human intervention in nature unavoidably brings negative side-
effects and systematically comes with risks and new uncertainties which lead to new 
conﬂicts and legitimisation problems for governments and experts. Modern forms of 
technology governance and problem-oriented research like TA can be regarded as an 
answer to these problems. The idea, mission and practice of TA can be understood 
as emanating from reﬂexive modernisation (Delvenne et al., 2011; Hennen, 1999, 
Grunwald, t.b.p). Although it is quite obvious that globalisation, with its achieve-
ments and problems, is part of or an enactment and consequence of modernity, it 
must be seen also as underlying the problems of “reﬂexive modernisation”, which

60

explains much of its ambivalent character. We will touch on examples of these issues 
in the next section. 
4 
Three Dimensions of Modern Globalisation: Culture, 
Economy and Risks 
The debate on globalisation is not just a debate about its sources or about the level of 
interconnectedness and interdependency; it is essentially a debate about what globali-
sation has brought about or will bring about in the future. A positive normative conno-
tation of globalisation as a vision of cosmopolitanism, global exchange across world 
views, global joint problem-solving and global democracy might be widespread, but 
this vision is not uncontested, and those in favour of it are also aware of the prob-
lems that globalisation brings and the challenges ahead in this cosmopolitan vision 
of globalisation. The debate on globalisation is not only concerned with and driven 
by the question of how globalisation proceeds, but always also evolves around the 
question of whether it is for good or for bad. 
4.1 
Cultural Globalisation 
As well as capturing the often contradictory and diverse developments that can be 
regarded as features or effects of globalisation, one of the central problems is the 
question of “global culture”.2 Are we on the way to cultural homogeneity, to a 
global culture, i.e. a worldwide alignment of ways of life, world views and normative 
orientations? Opinions are strongly divided and range from bold statements on the 
increasing homogeneity of culture across the globe to a diversiﬁcation or even a 
“clash of cultures” (Huntington, 1996). In the latter notion, globalisation is regarded 
as the cause of conﬂicts and terrorist activities of cultural fundamentalism. This clash 
can also be observed from a different angle when national governments perceive 
criticism based on Western notions of human rights and democracy as illegitimate 
interventions in their internal affairs and cultural traditions. It is not our intention 
here to give a consistent analysis of the debate on global culture; the point we want 
to make is that technology matters. 
Since the 1960s, electronic mass media (namely TV) and the economic Western 
hegemony in the production of media content have enabled the diffusion of (mainly) 
the American way of life and norms and values around the globe, by means of movies, 
TV soaps and advertisements, but also political news broadcasts. This has led to the 
notion of the homogenisation of cultures: globally, people are watching the same TV 
shows and formats, play the same video games and consume the same products. This
2 The following paragraphs owe much to Martell (2017) where a more detailed analysis of the 
complexity of cultural globalisation is available.

61
has often included the notion that Western culture is about to erode local or regional 
cultures and that authentic cultural identities are substituted by an “impoverished” 
global consumption culture. So cultural imperialism and commercialisation are often 
seen as the drivers of homogeneity (see, e.g. Bourdieu, 2003). 
However, salient phenomena referred to as “glocalisation” can also be observed. 
There are means to adopt formats as well as content to local or regional traditions, 
needs and values. And some of the changes in global culture obviously travel the 
other way—i.e. cultural production of Asia and Africa (lifestyle, music, movies, as 
well as world views, philosophies, religion) are adopted in Western countries. These 
phenomena lead to the notion of a “hybridisation” (e.g. Nederveen Pieterse, 2004) 
of global culture. Due to the intensiﬁed and extended exchanges made possible via 
new media as well as by international tourism and massive migration, we arrive at a 
global culture which is a mix of inputs from all parts of the world. “Global cities” such 
as London, New York or Hong Kong are regarded as knots of globalisation, where 
cultures are mixed and identities are manifold (Sassen, 2001). The same process may, 
however, also imply a loss of ability for local communities to keep their identities or 
produce meaning for their members whose identity is shaped more by foreign inﬂu-
ences than by local experiences (Bauman, 1998; Beck, 2017). The Internet allows 
for a diversiﬁcation of the cultural content produced and dispersed. Thus, there is an 
abundant space to express cultural identities and political views which are opposite 
to dominant political cultures and interests. The migration from Asia and Africa to 
Western countries (often from formerly colonised territories) leads to introducing 
new cultural elements into Western nations that may be either acknowledged as 
“multi-culturalism” or opposed by xenophobic right-wing populist groups. So, it is 
not clear whether hybridisation of culture is leading to an increasingly shared global 
culture or to a (peaceful or conﬂictive) coexistence of hybrid cultures and ways of 
life. 
As discussed above, communication technologies, migration and global travel 
currently create global interconnectedness on the symbolic level. Economic calculus 
and commercialisation are important drivers which shape the content and values that 
make up the cultural exchange. At the same time however, this interconnectedness 
allows for a diversity of cultural expressions to come into dialogue with one other in 
a way not previously possible. This involves options for creativity and enrichment of 
cultural experience and also presents a source of conﬂict about identities. The central 
question is to what extent our economic interdependence, as well as the ways in which 
we are affected by global problems, is accompanied by developing a cosmopolitan 
perspective, or at least a widespread feeling of global citizenship. And further, to 
what extent can global digital exchange contribute to a sense of global citizenship, 
or in contrast lead to strengthening group identities that experience themselves as 
exclusive and superior to others? The political implications of cultural globalisation 
are pivotal to this.

4.2 
Economic Globalisation 
History shows that specialisation and rationalisation of production, including national 
and later international division of labour and the search for new markets and prof-
itable trade relations, have been central driving forces for global interchange. This 
process has always been facilitated by technical and social innovations opening up 
new options and allowing the expansion of the exchange of goods and of resources 
all over the globe. In the 1990s, this culminated in technical options for real-time 
exchange and dislocation of ﬁnance. Technical innovations, like the Internet, have 
facilitated salient features of globalisation such as migration (of labour and tourism), 
the availability of information and news from all parts of the globe to everybody, 
globally integrated production chains, and global markets, as well as the socio-
cultural modes of globalisation. According to McKinsey (2019, 72), cross-border 
data ﬂows have grown 148 times larger from 2005 to 2017 (measured by used cross-
border bandwidth: from 5 terabits in 2005 to 704 terabits in 2017). Innovation is the 
driver of the global integration of production and trade, in terms of facilitating global 
transactions. Innovation also fuels the production and exchange of commodities. At 
the same time, economic rationalities and increasing international competition are 
driving the innovation system through internationalisation of technology develop-
ment and knowledge exchange. The big players of the digital economy are multi-
national tech companies using integrated production and supply chains all over the 
world. 
Since the 1980s, the global exchange of goods and services has been growing 
signiﬁcantly, and the production chains have become more and more complex. In 
2019, the global trade value of goods exported throughout the world amounted to 
approximately 19 trillion U.S. dollars at current prices, compared to around 6.45 
trillion U.S. dollars in 2000 (www.statistica.com, 26-07-21). Foreign direct invest-
ments have been growing massively from 1990 (239.4 billion $) to 2007 (3.134 
trillion $) (data.worldbank.org/27.07.21). The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 brought about 
a slowdown of economic globalisation. Foreign direct investments went down to 
1.744 trillion $ in 2019. But still, world trade has been growing signiﬁcantly, 
although not faster than industrial production (Felbermayer & Görg, 2020, 264). 
Most signiﬁcant for globalisation is the relevance of knowledge-intensive goods 
and services. Although globalisation is often identiﬁed with the global exchange of 
labour-intensive goods, with China as the current largest producer, value chains in 
this sector represent only 3% of global gross output and employ only 3% of the 
global workforce. Value chains of knowledge-intensive goods production (automo-
bile, computers, machinery) account for 13% of gross output and even 35% of trade 
(McKinsey, 2019, 2).  
The interconnectedness of the world economy brings about not only an increase in 
international trade and production, but also new insecurities and vulnerabilities. As 
shown by the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007/2008, the international mobility of ﬁnance— 
driven by the real-time exchange of money and investments made possible by the 
Internet—induces repercussions on the world economy from local or regional events

(like the breakdown of the American real estate market). The central question that 
sparks ﬁerce political and scientiﬁc debate is: who beneﬁts from economic globali-
sation? This question is closely related to the effects of neoliberal politics as well as 
to changes in international power relations. 
The push of the globalisation of economic exchange in the decades after World 
War II (which took over from the phase of European colonialism in the nineteenth 
century) was clearly dominated by the US and its Western partners, who in the 1980s 
shifted to neoliberal politics demanding the abandonment of market regulations and 
protectionist barriers (see, e.g. Crouch, 2018). The effects of this policy pushed 
advanced economies signiﬁcantly, but also led to pressure on the Western welfare 
system, inducing new inequalities within Western economies. This pressure increased 
with the entry of China into the global market, which together with the countries of 
the former Soviet Union had formerly been excluded from globalisation. Low-wage 
production was shifted to China and other Asian countries, and Western economies 
had to foster economic activities in high-wage production and service activities, with 
problems for the low-wages sector of their home labour markets. This was connected 
with an increasing tendency of parts of the population to apprehend “globalisation” 
as a menace to their economic situation. This has contributed to strong nationalist 
and (in connection with global migration of workforces and refugees) xenophobic 
tendencies, indicating a countertendency towards cultural globalisation (see above). 
With regard to international relations, Asian countries whose economies had been 
pushed by global economic exchange—especially China—could increase their inter-
national weight drastically, thus ending the phase of Western (US) domination. For 
people in emerging economies, the globalisation push of the 1990s has come with 
stronger participation in world trade and a higher level of welfare for a growing 
sector of the population, especially in China. Since 1990, a billion people outside 
the advanced economies have emerged from poverty, which for critics of current 
international politics like Crouch (2018) is a reason to dismiss any attempt to return 
to national protectionist policies. Compared to 1995, in 2017 developing countries’ 
(excluding China) share in the world market as regions receiving goods and services 
increased from 20 to 29%, with China’s share increasing from 3 to 12%. In terms 
of production, the share of non-Western countries in the global economy has also 
been increased (although mostly for developing countries in low-wage value chains). 
China’s share in global output grew from 6% in 2000 to 33% in 2017 (McKinsey, 
2019, 64). In China today, only 1.9% of the population live in poverty. However, as 
in other new economies, economic development is unequally distributed within the 
country: the inequality of the distribution of wealth in China nowadays is (according 
to the Gini coefﬁcient) greater than in the US (Crouch, 2018 24). 
The pressure of neoliberal politics—executed for a long period by the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank—on developing countries to open their 
markets for international trade often worked out negatively for emerging economies 
because they could not compete with stronger economies. Thus, while South-East 
Asia was able to beneﬁt from globalisation, most African countries could not. And 
moreover, less advanced economies are more vulnerable than advanced economies 
to critical developments of the world economy. For example, the reduction of foreign

direct investments (see above) during the recent COVID-19 pandemic years hits tran-
sition economies much harder than advanced ones (UNCTAD, 2021). The oppor-
tunities for emerging economies to actively participate in global markets (not only 
as a provider of raw materials or as an extended cheap work bench for advanced 
economies) strongly depend on access to technologies. To achieve this, support 
is required in assessing options to adopt new technologies in an environmentally 
and socially sound way to limit negative repercussions for societies—meaning that 
concepts like Technology Assessment would have a role to play (Ely et al., 2014). 
Despite the positive effects of globalisation for many people in emerging and 
transition economies, it is still the case that the countries which beneﬁt most from 
globalisation are the advanced OECD economies (paradoxically often those with the 
biggest problems with national-populist reactions among their populations). The UN 
World Social Report “Inequality in a changing world” (2020) states (taken from the 
report’s summary): 
• Although the income inequality between countries did improve during the last 
25 years (mainly due to strong growth in China and other emerging economies), 
the gap between countries is still considerable. Average income of people in North 
America is 16 times higher than of people in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
• Income inequality between countries has improved but inequality within countries 
has grown. Today, 71% of the world’s population live in countries where inequality 
has grown. 
• Income and wealth are increasingly concentrated at the top. In 2018, the 26 richest 
people held as much wealth as half of the population (the 3.8 billion poorest 
people), down from 43 people the year before. 
• Although gender inequalities have been shrinking for some woman in certain 
occupations, at the same time women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid 
care work each day, a contribution to the world economy 3 times the size of the 
global tech industry. 
• If climate change continues to be unaddressed, it will increase inequality within 
and between countries. 
• With a global trend towards urbanisation, cities will ﬁnd “high levels of wealth 
and modern infrastructure coexist with pockets of severe deprivation often side 
by side”.

Globalisation of Risks 
The relation between science, technology and society and the question of bringing 
the ever-accelerating pace of technology development and use into relation with 
the needs and values held by different groups in society has been at the centre of 
political and scientiﬁc discourse for many decades. The debate about how to come 
to terms with often negative effects of technology on society and the environment 
can be said to have changed the political landscape in terms of issues that are high 
on political agendas, and in terms of relevant political actors and parties, at least in

Western societies. TA is a product of this development. What is absolutely necessary 
in order to provide a full picture of globalisation, and has a special bearing for TA 
and technology governance, is the fact that the science and society discourse and 
its main reference, i.e. the problem of managing ethical ambiguities and social and 
environmental risks, has become a global discourse due to the global character of 
the problems to be dealt with, and the global strategies required to deal with these 
problems. 
Global warming and the ﬁercely discussed need for global strategies to reduce 
the CO2 footprint of our economies is only the most salient example of how we are 
not only globalised in economic or cultural terms. We are also a global community 
both producing and affected by risks. The risks that we necessarily take while we 
are shaping our futures through our growing capacities for action and intervening 
in the world are of global character, as is the uncertainty of the knowledge that 
we necessarily produce and have to deal with when trying to manage these risks 
and decide on safe enough, ethically viable options to pursue, on the individual 
as well as the societal level. Globalisation in this respect also proves to be the most 
advanced state of “reﬂexive modernisation”, of the process of undermining the hopes 
and rationales of modernity, and its belief in the unambiguous beneﬁts of technical 
progress as well as the application of its heredity of rational criticism and scrutiny 
to the achievements of modernity itself (Science, Technology, Rationalisation of all 
kinds of human activities). 
What have been discussed as features of the “risk society” on a national level since 
the 1990s (Beck, 1986/1992) have now become issues of the “world risk society”. In 
the 1980s, the depletion of the ozone layer of the atmosphere caused by the world-
wide use of chloroﬂuorocarbons was one of the ﬁrst phenomena to be perceived as 
an effect of global production of environmental risks. The ﬁnite nature and insta-
bility of fossil fuel supply had become obvious in the 1970s, making it clear that 
global natural resources are limited. Nowadays, the planetary boundaries of various 
fundamental resources, such as arable farm land or freshwater, are acknowledged 
(see, e.g. Rockström et al., 2009). Air and environmental pollution could never be 
regarded as phenomena that end at national borders, and the pollution of the world 
oceans with plastics, the remainders of the essential material of modern lifestyles as 
well as the global reduction of biodiversity make this all too obvious. 
Conﬂicts about the distribution of the beneﬁts and risks of innovations (whether 
in terms of environmental risks or the effects of new production technologies on 
economies and labour markets) are now global conﬂicts. The question of “who will 
be the losers, who are the winners of modernisation?”, the questions of access to 
resources, knowledge and markets all need to be addressed on a global scale. There 
is also the question of who should contribute, to what extent and how, to developing 
the necessary strategies of reduction of resource consumption and outputs. The prime 
example is the much-needed reduction of CO2 emissions by changes to sustainable 
production and lifestyles, where it is important to note that the carbon emissions of 
the richest 1% are more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity 
(see, e.g. Oxfam, 2020).

As regards to ethics, it appears to be difﬁcult to align the challenges of innovation 
such as human in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and the promises of embryo research 
or of genome manipulation with relevant values and religious beliefs at the level 
of national policymaking. Reaching a consensus on ethical barriers and effective 
legal regulations in biotechnology, synthetic biology or nanotechnology is a global 
challenge for which mutual respect and productive exchange of cultures are needed 
(Ladikas et al., 2015). Not least, the push of global real-time exchange of data and the 
related risks for privacy, and of abuse of the Internet for manipulating political debates 
are issues induced by the global character of digital networks that demand global 
political reactions. The social networks are as global as the sources of manipulation 
and misuse that are driven by digital warfare and criminal activities. The list of global 
risks seems endless and includes challenges attached to global migration, cultural 
globalisation and global terrorism. 
Thus, we are a global community with respect to the central challenges we face in 
our everyday lives and in politics. Beck (2017) argued convincingly that we are facing 
a “metamorphosis of the world” that asks for a new global perspective, including 
social scientiﬁc analysis, since the societal structures, interdependencies and prob-
lems as well as political options that we have to take into account in our private 
and political lives can no longer be restricted to the perspective of the nation state. 
Central concepts of societal change, societal revolution and transformation that are 
tied to the concept of the nation state are no longer valid or useful and have to make 
room for what Beck calls “methodological cosmopolitism”, that is, the systematic 
account of the cosmopolitan character of modern society and its problems. 
The driver of this “cosmopolitan” metamorphosis is the world risk society and 
its “comprehensive, and profound failure” indicated by global environmental prob-
lems, world poverty, global inequality, global economic crisis and the related global 
conﬂicts (Beck, 2017, 32). But the other side of this, Beck holds, is the fact that 
a new cosmopolitan consciousness is growing alongside the problems. The global 
complaints and allegations regarding these problems are indications that also subjec-
tively we are cosmopolitans—we are aware of the global character of our situation 
and we know that we can only deal with them by taking up a cosmopolitan perspec-
tive. Also, our risk perception and the normative horizons we apply in our search for 
solutions are becoming (or must become) “cosmopolitan”. 
5 
The Need for Reﬂexive Global Governance 
Now that we have become a global “community of fate” (Beck, 2017), it still needs 
to be proven whether we are able to form a global community of action, a political 
community. And this, ﬁrst of all, is a question of global awareness of the global 
character of the challenges ahead and the willingness to take joint action on a global 
scale. Is there a potential for (democratic) world politics based on a common civic 
culture allowing for open global exchange about joint problems and their possible 
solutions?

Globalisation as Reﬂexive Modernisation—Implications …
67
With regard to policymaking in the ﬁeld of environmental risks, technolog-
ical innovations and their ethical and socio-economic implications, the question is 
whether it is possible on a global level to implement adequate structures and processes 
of deliberation and decision-making. This would require institutions and procedures 
that allow for “reﬂexivity”. “Reﬂexivity” means to reﬂect on the uncertainties we 
face and critically assess the knowledge at hand, including different cultural views 
as well as the variety of needs and capacities that are given by differing environ-
mental conditions (such as climate or access to water). Reﬂexivity includes taking 
into account the existing inequalities and asymmetries of the global economy. 
Sheila Jasanoff (2007) speaks of “global civic epistemologies” that comprise the 
ways, procedures, institutions and rules of societies to achieve consensus about what 
we can hold to be certain or legitimate as arguments, what uncertainties we actu-
ally are faced with and what are realistic options for problem-solving. This involves 
formal as well as informal structures of exchange and deliberation. It involves institu-
tions of representative democracy that are informed by the best science as well as by 
their citizens. It asks for an open public sphere, a space accessible to everybody for 
the exchange of information and arguments. It needs an active civil society providing 
for a system of articulating needs and problems and monitoring the performance of 
political decision-making with regard to these. It depends on a variety of sources 
of knowledge production that can serve as independent and trustworthy references 
for societal reﬂection and discourse. It also would include all kinds of informal 
political communications such as fora and meetings, as well as online and ofﬂine 
deliberations. All of these would be needed on a global level. Some exist already 
or are emerging alongside growing awareness of global risks, such as global fora of 
problem deﬁnitions and mutual understanding as well as more manifest negotiations 
about mutual commitments or agreements that come close to globally binding legal 
regulations. The shape and functionality of a global system of civic epistemologies 
are however a desideratum which has to face many challenges. 
With a view to global discourses as well as social movements regarding central 
aspects of the world risk society (climate change, environmental pollution and 
sustainable use of global resources, equal access to technologies and knowledge, 
economic inequalities and unequal development, migration and refugees), there 
is reason for some humble optimism. There are indications that a cosmopolitan 
consciousness and a feeling of global citizenship is evolving and is able to put 
pressure on institutions of governance at the national as well as the global level. 
The growing involvement of civil society organisations in the activities of interna-
tional organisations and global phenomena of public awareness—such as Fridays for 
Future, a youth-led and -organised global climate strike movement—indicates that a 
central feature of democratic problem-solving can function on a global level. This is 
the observation and criticism of politics by attentive publics, and the awareness and 
responsiveness of decision-makers to such global publics and their manifestations 
in their home countries. Thus, there are some indications that Beck was right when 
stating that “… global risks bring about globalised public spheres – these again make 
global risks visible and equip them with political relevance” (Beck, 2017, 168, see 
also the chapter on the global public sphere, this volume).

L. Hennen and R. van Est
At the same time, we have seen in the section about cultural globalisation that 
“globalisation of minds” is an ambivalent and conﬂicting process. People have the 
means to communicate in real time across the globe and are aware of the situation and 
mind-sets of other regions of the world like never before. But we should not overlook 
that the great bulk of communication around the globe is of commercial character, and 
the commercialisation of culture globally appears to function as a vehicle to spread 
Western lifestyles and consumerism (see, e.g. Bourdieu, 2003). The means of global 
communication can be misused for disinformation and also bring about counter-
reactions of fostering nationalism and populistic movements that regard globalisation 
as a menace to cultural identities. Due to disparities and asymmetries in the world 
economy, there are also asymmetries in the opportunity to articulate one’s views. In 
addition, hegemonic cultural structures beneﬁt disproportionately from means and 
technologies of cultural globalisation. This clearly affects the normative foundations 
of options for global governance of S&T. Even ideas as universalistic as global human 
rights can serve as vehicles for Western hegemony when connected with neoliberal 
concepts of economy. They can be used to hide or justify the continuing existence 
of discrepancies in access to markets, and thus to welfare and participation in the 
beneﬁts of globalisation. How do Western accounts of individual rights relate to other 
more collectivist or economic ideas of rights, such as the right to food and water? 
Thus, despite strong indications of an emerging “cosmopolitan” perspective on the 
goods and bads of globalisation, there is a huge task ahead to provide for spaces and 
opportunities where cultures can meet and discuss differences in what they regard 
to be the problems of our time and world. These need to be meeting spaces where 
people can reﬂect on the values they want to apply to evaluate the societal meaning of 
innovations and the acceptability of risks, and on how widely accepted values such 
as equality, justice, welfare, the common good and individual liberty and dignity 
actually can be meaningfully applied to concrete problems. 
Besides deliberative spaces, global civic epistemologies also need functioning 
global structures of governance and decision-making. Globalisation has brought 
about a decline of the governance powers of the nation state. And so far this is 
counterbalanced only by weak structures of transnational governance. The increased 
integration of the global economy has strengthened the ability of globally operating 
transnational companies to direct investments to economies with conditions that ﬁt 
their purposes best in terms of the price of labour and resources, as well as low 
levels of social-welfare restrictions and regulations. As a consequence, the abilities 
of nation states to preserve the social contract based on welfare policies have become 
restricted. For many, this represents one reason for the growth of populist movements 
and policies over the last two decades. According to some, the increasing powers of 
non-state actors in setting the rules of international economic exchange—which is 
also manifest in the often neoliberal policies of international organisations such as 
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or World Bank—indicate the beginning of an 
area of “post-democracy” (Crouch, 2004). In addition, global risks delegitimise the 
national state: the foremost function of the national state is to provide protection for 
its population. Yet a national state’s capacities to do this are massively restricted by 
global risks whose sources and effects it cannot control. National law is only valid

for the national population, but blind with regard to the effects, and those affected, 
beyond its national boundaries (Beck, 2017, 132 ff.). The late British historian Eric 
Hobsbawm in his account of globalisation concluded that we are facing the global 
problems of the twenty-ﬁrst century with a set of political mechanisms that are not ﬁt 
to help. Neither the counting of votes nor the measurements of consumer preferences 
in a global market would help to solve the problems of a globalised world (Hobs-
bawm, 2009, 114 f.). Indeed, the international and transnational institutions of global 
governance that have been built up since the Second World War—most salient are the 
different programmes of the UN—lack democratic legitimation by not being directly 
accountable to a global citizenry. With the exception of the European Union, citizen-
ship and related political rights are restricted to national boundaries. This democratic 
deﬁcit combines with the difﬁculties in coming to international agreements on crit-
ical matters that go beyond a minimum consensus, and the restricted powers of 
transnational governance institutions to enforce the international observance of any 
agreements reached. 
At the same time, there are strong indications of transnational awareness of the 
need for “cosmopolitan” policymaking in the light of global challenges and problems. 
This is indicated by the growing number and importance of international agreements 
on environmental, security and health issues supported by international organisations 
such as the WHO, OECD, WTO and not the least by the UN. Since the Earth Summit 
in 1992, the UN has made sustainable development a main issue in its activities and 
has set up a global exchange on how to translate deﬁned sustainable development 
goals into international programmes of knowledge sharing, technology transfer and 
national programmes of economic development and innovation (see chapter on global 
governance, this volume). Other activities are related to health issues, to questions 
of security of digital innovations or to ethical evaluation and regulation of the use 
of biotechnology and human genome research. Most outstanding when thinking of 
reﬂexive modes of governance is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), through which the UN has established a body of science and policy advice 
whose reports are acknowledged as an independent and reliable source of informa-
tion all over the globe. Many of these achievements in establishing processes and 
institutions of global governance are dealt with in more detail in chapters in this 
volume. 
The legitimation of transnational institutions of policymaking and transnational 
agreements is a critical issue. Citizens have inﬂuence on politics in the framework of 
the nation state but not at the level of the United Nations or other transnational insti-
tutes. For the moment, it appears to be utopian to think of a global democracy in terms 
of global elections and government. The authority of international governance struc-
tures (institutions and agreements) is critical. Global governance structures cannot 
rely on unquestioning recognition of rules and regulations by those who are expected 
to comply. Its authority is not based on cultural traditions and cannot rely on coer-
cive means. The authority of global governance structures has thus been coined to 
be “reﬂexive authority” (Zürn, 2016). The recognition of authority is not a given but 
is a reﬂexive act, constantly open to critical assessment in the light of the legitimacy 
of the procedures applied, the “epistemic authority” of knowledge references (such

70
L. Hennen and R. van Est
as, e.g. the IPCC), as well as the congruence between decisions taken and normative 
expectations. 
There might currently be little prospect for more global democratic decision-
making structures or institutions beyond the existing often not very powerful and 
conﬂictual ones. It is therefore more necessary to support the “reﬂexive authority” 
of existing structures. This can be done by providing for transparency and respon-
siveness in international decision-making and establishing strong connections with 
civil society. Both might best be achieved by—involving civil society organisations 
in global governance, as is already the case to some degree. But there is also a role 
for intermediate “reﬂexive” organisations and initiatives of policy advice in the ﬁeld 
of science and technology. Such institutions—as among others the overview on TA 
activities given in this volume shows—exist around the globe and nationally are often 
already closely involved as an independent actor in policymaking. 
The legitimacy of global politics can be supported with regard to the two central 
dimension of its legitimacy. First, the quality of decisions taken, which is the appropri-
ateness and effectiveness of its output, and by this its acceptability by the addressees 
(output legitimacy). And second, the quality and representativeness of the data, argu-
ments and articulated needs and demands that inform its decisions (input legitimacy). 
Both dimensions are supported at the national level by a broad scope of indepen-
dent “knowledge brokers” (Pielke, 2007). Institutions like the IPCC do a similar 
job on the global level. To join forces between organisations involved in TA and 
policy advice for technology governance from all parts of the world would open up 
additional means in the ﬁeld of S&T policy. The central task would be to provide 
problem-related normative knowledge, as well as factual knowledge based on TA 
studies from national TA institutions, and organise co-operative work to develop 
synthesis based on such studies. The central means would be to organise input from 
the global public and civil societies around the globe for international negotiations. 
Governance is a term for a co-operative rather than a top-down mode of reaching 
policies and decisions in an increasingly complex policymaking environment. This 
complexity is even higher at the global level. Global governance is about more than 
just the relationship between states. It is about ways to involve a broad spectrum of 
actors in governance issues in order to achieve a best and best-accepted solution for 
problems by making use of the different sources of knowledge and the full spectrum 
of the potential for action. Global governance of S&T with all its implications for 
environment, health, the economy and social justice is, as has been stated by an expert 
commission of the EU, “… faced with the challenge of rapidly-advancing possibili-
ties realized through research. Across borders the social contexts within which new 
knowledge is generated, distributed and regulated will vary hugely. Science never-
theless remains a non-state and transnational social institution, so that its governance 
is necessarily global, both internally and externally” (EU, 2016). 
It is a complex task to make use of the many sources of knowledge that are provided 
by the social institutions of science around the globe to come to a critical assessment 
of both the state of research as well as of arguments in societal discourse. But this 
is needed in order to come to legitimate decisions on a global scale with regard to 
complex problems emerging from scientiﬁc and technological modernity, as there is

Globalisation as Reﬂexive Modernisation—Implications …

“… no sensorium for global risks, no direct perception and experience, no evidence 
achievable based on common sense alone” (Beck, 2017, 133). It is mainly through 
scientiﬁc evidence that global risks are testiﬁed and can be experienced. The issues of 
justice and equal access to the economic opportunities of globalisation as well as the 
challenges of aligning different cultural perspectives to problems and solutions need 
support from reliable knowledge arrived at in scientiﬁcally supported modes of global 
deliberation. This scientiﬁc mediation makes “reﬂexivity” and reﬂexive concepts like 
TA salient. The high level of reﬂexivity involved in this endeavour is exactly the level 
needed to face the risks and opportunities of globalisation. Reﬂexive modernisation, 
of which globalisation is maybe the most complex feature, needs reﬂexive global 
governance of S&T, where knowledge-based structures and institutions have a role 
to play as intermediates between science, society and policymaking. 
• The sources and effects of globalisation are often of local character. Identiﬁcation 
of problems and providing appropriate solutions is in need of “connecting the dots” 
through global networks of independent problem-oriented research and advice. 
• A reliable knowledge base is needed as input to the search for common policy 
on a global level which affords reﬂexive and open exchange on the broad scope 
of effects of S&T on society in different national environments, on the different 
problems and perspectives in different parts of the globe as well as on different 
values and conﬂictive demands and expectations. 
• Reliable input has to be elaborated to ongoing global discussions as well as policies 
(UN) on ways to achieve a sustainable, i.e. environmentally sound and socially 
equal and inclusive development of societies and economies. 
• “Science in Society” as a concept and reality has to be spelled out on a global 
level. The existing systems and institutions of global governance lack democratic 
legitimisation and input from a wide range of relevant actors. TA can serve as a 
facilitator for inclusive formats in the mainstream zone of decision-making. 
It is obvious that with these challenges ahead, TA has to think about its own role and 
mission. Reﬂexivity in this respect also applies to TA itself. Just as globalisation in the 
sense of cosmopolitan interchange cannot be about modelling the world according to 
Western standards and formats, “Global TA” cannot be about just exporting Western 
thinking about the central problems of the science and society complex to the rest of 
the world. As a means of global reﬂexive technology governance, TA may have to 
reinvent itself in the confrontation with problems, expectations and needs as deﬁned 
by many and various cultures or communities. Problems of access to technologies, 
adopting these to local needs, and normative standards as well as economic and 
political power relations implied in the adaptation of new technologies then might be 
as much in the focus of standard TA studies as the assessment of risks and hazards, 
and the discussion of generalised ethical standards.

Technology Assessment and Public 
Spheres in the Context of Globalization: 
A Blueprint for the Future 
Rinie van Est
and Leonhard Hennen 
1 
Introduction 
While the private or domestic sphere is the realm of family life, friends, and personal 
matters, the public sphere is where the expression and discussion of ideas occur 
regarding common concerns and collective social interests. The term “public sphere” 
is often used in the singular form, but “in large-scale, differentiated late modern 
societies, not least in the context of nation states permeated by globalization, we have 
to understand the public sphere as constituting many different spaces” (Dahlgren, 
2005, 148). That is why we prefer to use the plural form here—public spheres—to 
recognize that there are countless forms of fragmentation and contestation and both 
off- and online public spheres. And within the global context there is a collection of 
public spheres that can vary from deeply democratic to authoritarian (cf. Dukalskis, 
2017). 
Public spheres can arise when people express their personal experiences of partic-
ular problems and solutions in public. This may allow others to listen and recognize 
those experiences as a public issue, and to develop a shared understanding of the prob-
lems and solutions, together with a collective will to address them. In these public 
sphere processes, media of all kinds play a central role in the circulation of informa-
tion and the interactions and communication between people. This chapter reﬂects 
on the relationship between public spheres and technology assessment (TA), which 
addresses the relationship between technological and social change. In particular, we

consider the connection between TA and public spheres from a global perspective, 
that is, from the context of globalization. The globalization of science and technology, 
among other things, impacts the theory and practice of TA, but there has been little 
reﬂection on the signiﬁcance of this. 
We begin that reﬂection by stating that TA wants to make the social signiﬁcance 
of technological change publicly visible and open to discussion. TA assumes that 
groups of people can be affected both positively and negatively by scientiﬁc and 
technological developments. These (positive and negative) consequences can lead 
to certain groups in society becoming politicized and thus becoming a public that 
creates a public sphere. According to Dewey (2016, 69), “The public consists of 
all those who are affected by the indirect consequences of transactions to such an 
extent that it is deemed necessary to have those consequences systematically cared 
for.”1 This is where the “all-affected” principle—also known as the “congruence,” 
“symmetry,” or even “democratic” principle—comes into play, which generally says 
that “all who are affected by a decision should have a right to participate into making 
it” (Dahl, 1970, 64; quoted in Lagerspetz, 2015, 6).  
Based on this thought, TA should critically relate to the public sphere. For example, 
which people, interests, visions and issues do or do not receive attention? In particular, 
TA’s role is to make publics which are emerging from the inﬂuence of science and 
technology visible in the public debate and give them a voice. When TA takes glob-
alization seriously, the global perspective provides an additional critical perspective 
on the public sphere, especially the national public sphere. The Global TA network, 
almost by deﬁnition, wants to take globalization seriously and therefore starts from 
the awareness that it is important to take into account an international context when 
performing a TA activity. In view of the all-affected principle and the fact that science 
and technology and their social consequences are global phenomena, TA should 
therefore, in principle, take into account the groups of people that are affected world-
wide, rather than only in the country where the TA is exercised or the countries where 
TA is institutionalized. 
The above ﬁrst reﬂection already indicates the relevance of the global perspective 
on public spheres and TA. This will be further elaborated in this chapter. We do 
this by ﬁrst examining the relationship from a national context, because both TA 
and academic thinking about public spheres are mainly approached from the point 
of view of national political decision-making. Given our interest in the connections 
between public spheres and TA, we focus on those public spheres that deal with the 
societal signiﬁcance of technology, or the nexus between science, technology and 
society (STS), which we call “STS-like” public spheres. We then reﬂect on public 
spheres in a context of globalization and describe how TA institutes, networks, and 
activities are organized beyond national borders. Informed by that, we look at the 
link between public spheres and TA in a global context and ﬁnish by sketching a 
blueprint for the future of global TA. But ﬁrst we start by characterizing the public 
sphere concept by means of six dimensions. This characterization is needed in order
1 According to Rogers (2016) Dewey’s language of ‘indirect consequences’ is “deceptive because 
he appears to also mean harmful or unwanted consequences, indirect or not” (Rogers 2016, 35).

to interpret the academic discussion about the public spheres and their relationship 
with TA in both the national and global contexts. 
2 
Six Characteristics of Public Spheres 
The term public sphere is a contested (Tully, 2012), fuzzy concept. To make it more 
precise, we will characterize public spheres by means of six characteristics: four 
information and communication processes, the central role of media, and the public 
sphere as a space between the private sphere and other societal domains such as 
science and technology, economics, and politics. 
Habermas (1989) used the German term “Öffentlichkeit,” which was translated 
in English as “public sphere.” “Öffentlichkeit” refers to “publicity” in the sense that 
what happens in the public sphere is to a certain extent visible, legible, accessible, 
negotiable, shareable, debatable, and actionable to and by people. The term “public 
sphere” refers to the fact that publics, i.e., groups of people, create that sphere. 
The public sphere represents a multiplicity of publics, bringing different experi-
ences, opinions, types of knowledge, value orientations, and capabilities to iden-
tify and articulate public problems and propose solutions, and to take action. This 
phenomenon, in which the human experience of what is happening in the world is 
collectively interpreted, can be made more tangible by distinguishing four processes 
in which the formation of publics can take place around collective issues, shared 
public understanding, public will, and action. It is these activities that constitute the 
public sphere. 
Public expression and publishing of personal experiences 
As Dewey (2016) clariﬁed, problems, for example related to technologies or policies, 
ﬁrst have to be experienced or perceived by people who suffer from it now, or see 
people around them suffering, or fear suffering in the future. Something similar 
applies to solutions to problems, where their feasibility and desirability must ﬁrst 
be tested and experienced on a small scale. Such private experiences are not yet 
public issues. For that to happen, personal experiences must be expressed—words 
and images must be given to it—and made public so that they become visible for 
others. 
Public listening and recognition 
Publicly voicing problems and solutions gives fellow human beings the opportunity 
to listen to those outpourings. Informed in this way, other people may be able to 
recognize the particular problems and solutions, by putting themselves in the shoes of 
others and seeing the consequences of a certain development from their perspective. 
Human empathy has the potential to connect with similar people and people close to 
us, but also with citizens, non-citizens (like migrants), and non-humans (like animals 
and trees) who are far removed from us in terms of physical distance, time, and social 
context (Krznaric, 2010). If others recognize the problems and solutions in question,

78
R. van Est and L. Hennen
a public—a community of listening (Han, 2018)—may be formed around the relevant 
issues by means of the exchange of information and ideas, and through deliberation. 
Shared public understanding 
This is the start of a phase in which public opinion formation may take place. If a group 
of people can ﬁnd one another and become attuned with regard to the perception of 
problems and solutions, a shared recognition of problems that should be resolved in 
a particular way can arise (Raile et al., 2018). According to Rosanvallon (2008, 307), 
this also “involves the production of a language adequate to our social experience, a 
language capable of describing social life and therefore of inﬂuencing it.” 
Public will-formation and civic public action 
Such an alignment of the understanding of problems and solutions can lead to a 
collective commitment to address the situation in question. The term “public will-
formation” is often used to describe this process. According to Raile et al., (2014, 
105), public will becomes meaningful when “a social system has a shared recog-
nition of a particular problem and resolves to address the situation in a particular 
way through sustained collective action.” When we talk about collective action, it 
usually refers to activities of the state in the public interest. In this case, however, it 
speciﬁcally concerns activities of ordinary citizens to address certain concerns about 
their collective lives. Public action thus also has a civic aspect to it (cf. Spink, 2019). 
For example, Drèze and Sen (1991, vii) used public action to mean: “not merely the 
activities of the state, but also social actions taken by members of the public—both 
‘collaborative’ (through civic cooperation) and ‘adversarial’ (through social criticism 
and political opposition).” 
Civic public action is any form of organized action carried out by a group of 
people in order to address their needs and/or improve a certain problematic situation 
and achieve a common objective. These actions can be social, technical, economic, 
or political. Peaceful protests, awareness-raising, and grassroots campaigns are all 
forms of political action. Other forms of collective public action are, for example, 
a community of farmers agreeing upon how to best ration water from a common 
source, or forms of citizen science, like citizens measuring the severity of air pollution 
from industry or car trafﬁc in their neighborhood. A social movement is a loosely 
organized but sustained “form of collective action that articulates a social conﬂict and 
ultimately aims at transforming a social order” (Thörn, 2007, 900). To be successful, 
social movements must be skilled in information politics, i.e., “the ability to quickly 
and credibly generate politically usable information and move it to where it has the 
most impact” (Keck & Sikkink, 1998: 16). 
Central role of the media 
Both traditional and social media play a central role in all of the above-described 
information and communication processes. This dynamic is shaped by the political 
economy of media and enabled and constrained by information and communica-
tion technologies (ICTs), and the control of and access to them. The technological

infrastructure of the public sphere plays an important role, because it strongly inﬂu-
ences how people perceive and experience the world. While at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century people’s experiences were largely limited to what was happening 
locally, and news from other parts of the world often did not arrive until weeks later, 
nowadays people can often follow what is happening in almost every other place in 
the world in real time via satellite and Internet connections. Due to this intertwining 
of our private lives and the mix of traditional and social media, our personal life 
worlds have increasingly become sites of globalization (Volkmer, 2014). 
The public sphere as an in-between space 
The public sphere is positioned as a part of our society that fulﬁlls a linking func-
tion, an intermediary structure or role between the life world of people and more 
institutionalized societal domains, such as the private sector or economic sphere, the 
scientiﬁc and technological domain, and politics. This last characteristic is referred 
to as the “inbetween-ness” of the public sphere, or the public sphere as an in-between 
space, a nexus between the unorganized private world of people and the organized 
world of public and private institutions. 
Starting with Habermas, scientiﬁc discussion of the public sphere has tradition-
ally focused on the role the public sphere plays between people’s private lives and 
the national political system in democracies. This therefore involves an inbetween-
ness between “the nation state” and “the people,” in the capacity of citizens of the 
respective nation. This concerns citizens indicating what their social wishes are 
and expressing their conﬁdence about a particular political course. However, it also 
involves citizens critically monitoring and questioning existing policies, including 
organizing social counter forces to prevent the implementation of particular political 
decisions. 
From the perspective of globalization, this dominant view of the public sphere as 
the nexus between the people who are governed and the people who—or maybe better 
the institutions that—govern, immediately raises a number of essential questions (cf. 
Volkmer, 2014). For example, how can such a global public sphere arise and function 
in a situation where in the legal sense there is no such thing as a world citizen, and 
in the political sense there is no such thing as a world parliament (representing the 
entire world population with powers to frame international laws for the entire world), 
or world government (as a common political authority for all of humanity)? 
Before dealing with such thorny questions, let us ﬁrst consider the dominant model 
of the national public sphere as the space between the life world of citizens and the 
national democratic political system. We also look at the relationship between TA 
and the public sphere, as the political and public role of TA is often discussed at 
national level, in the way we have characterized the public sphere in this section. 
And given our interest in the connection between public spheres and TA, we focus on 
those public spheres that address the societal signiﬁcance of technology, or the nexus 
between science, technology and society (STS); so-called STS-like public spheres.

STS-Like Public Spheres and TA in a National Political 
Context 
Above, we distinguished between collective action by ordinary citizens and public 
authorities. In the academic literature, by far the most attention is paid to the way in 
which public recognition of certain issues, and subsequent public opinion-forming 
and will-formation can eventually lead to political action by governmental organiza-
tions. In order to achieve this, it is important that a sufﬁcient set of decision-makers 
become “committed to supporting a commonly perceived, potentially effective policy 
solution” (Post et al., 2010, 659). 
The basic premise of any political system—whether democratic or authoritarian 
(cf. Dukalskis, 2017)—is that the people who govern must somehow ﬁnd their legit-
imacy with the people they govern. Rosanvallon (2008, 328) speaks of the contin-
uous “crisis of political representation,” since there is a perpetual gap between the 
governors and the governed. This requires constant interaction and communication 
between the state and the people in order to reconcile societal needs and public 
policy. To examine the functioning of democratic political practice, Habermas used 
the concept of the public sphere to describe and reﬂect upon how this interaction 
between the “people” (i.e., “society”) and the “state” takes place and should take 
place. In essence, this is about enabling collective understanding of problems and 
solutions, collective will-formation, and transforming the public will into political 
will. 
Habermas (1989) became famous with an historical study which situated the 
emergence in the eighteenth century of the bourgeois public sphere in Germany, 
Great Britain, and France. Informed by newspapers, citizens gathered mostly in 
pubs, coffeehouses, and literary salons to discuss politics and society. According to 
Kellner (2000, 3) “for the ﬁrst time in history, individuals and groups could shape 
public opinion, giving direct expression to their needs and interests while inﬂuencing 
political practice.” In this way, which is at the crux of a democratic public sphere, 
precisely by forming a public sphere, citizens changed from those who are governed 
by the authorities to citizens who demanded a say in the issues and the way they were 
governed. This shows that people can also affect the form, role and function of the 
public sphere, and its link with the political system. In relation to this, a distinction 
can be made between engagement in and with public spheres, where the stake of the 
latter is the democratic transformation of the public sphere itself (Tully, 2012, 171). 
An inﬂuential normative framework regarding the public sphere in democracies 
is the Habermasian principle of an ideal speech situation. Habermas argues that to 
arrive at an adequate picture of the realities of society, opinion- and will-formation 
within the public sphere should be based on the free exchange of arguments and 
rational-critical discourse. He named six conditions for such a “power-free” ideal 
speech situation (Habermas, 2001). First, every citizen should have equal opportuni-
ties to participate in the public debate on a subject relevant to that citizen. Secondly, 
participants in the audience sphere must be truthful and say what they mean. The

81
third requirement relates to the autonomy of citizens and suggests that communica-
tion must be free of external and internal coercion. The fourth relates to the public 
character of the deliberations that take place in the public sphere. The ﬁfth condi-
tion concerns the rejection of hierarchy between participants and demands equal 
communicative rights for all, so that each can participate on an equal footing. The 
ﬁnal condition requires participants to have an intention to reach agreement, to be 
oriented toward consent, and requires that “participants reciprocally impute an orien-
tation to communicative agreement on one another, this … acceptance can only occur 
jointly or collectively” (Habermas, 2001, 44). 
3.1 
Three Factors Inﬂuencing the Autonomy of the Public 
Sphere 
The above normative ideal of the public sphere has never been fully achieved in prac-
tice. We can look at the ﬁrst condition concerning equal access to the public sphere. 
Habermas’ (1989) historical study situated the emergence in the eighteenth century 
of the bourgeois public sphere in Germany, Great Britain, and France. Informed by 
newspapers, citizens gathered mostly in pubs, coffeehouses, and literary salons to 
discuss politics and society. However, that bourgeois public sphere was accessible 
mainly to educated, propertied men, who conducted a discourse prejudicial to the 
interests of those excluded, like workers and women (Calhoun, 1992, 3). Here, we 
focus on the third criterion regarding the autonomy of the public sphere, and specif-
ically how its functioning is inﬂuenced by political rulers, science and technology, 
and the media. 
Political rulers—the problem of agenda-setting 
It is often implicitly assumed that public issues are put on the political agenda via 
the public sphere. The excluded groups mentioned above, for example, created their 
own publics—or better counter-publics—and alternative public spheres in order to 
politically claim their democratic voting rights and other rights. As a result, many 
important social issues, like women’s rights and environmental protection, which 
previously only played a role in alternative public spheres on the margins of civil 
society, have been placed on the political agenda (Habermas, 1996). However, issues 
are also put on the agenda via other routes. 
Many political issues do not originate in the public sphere, but in politics. Govern-
ments can choose to submit these issues to the critical public sphere in order to 
arrive at more adequate and legitimate problem perceptions and solutions. In some 
cases, the interaction between the public and public authorities is regulated by law. 
For example, since 1998 the United Nations Aarhus Convention grants the public 
rights regarding access to information, public participation, and access to justice in 
governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national,

82

and transboundary environment. However, citizens are not always involved in a trans-
parent and fair manner. Snider (2010) sees fake public participation as a widespread 
global phenomenon. 
The manipulative orchestration of public opinion by political movements and 
leaders may undermine the role of the public sphere in producing a legible world 
for citizens, and articulating the real needs of society. Archetypical anti-democratic 
populist leaders, like Perón in Argentina and Chávez in Venezuela, even aimed to 
manufacture the will of the people (Bartley, 2017). And once in power they broke 
down independent forms of civic organization, ranging from parliaments, govern-
mental agencies, and trades unions, to political parties. In this way, ﬂawed democra-
cies can turn into authoritarian regimes (cf. The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2015). 
The “authoritarian public sphere is characterized by the state’s efforts to establish 
its foundations, delineate its boundaries, and monitor its content” (Dukalskis, 2017, 
4). The authoritarian state manipulates the public sphere by positive legitimation 
(i.e., crafting and disseminating messages legitimating the regime) and negative 
repression, including blocking, censoring, or undermining viewpoints that might 
threaten the state’s narrative (ibid.). The fact that the information environment is 
imbued with aspects of reality prioritized by the state makes it difﬁcult for citizens to 
(individually and collectively) form an accurate picture of social reality. Dukalskis 
(2017, 4) shows that despite this challenge, sometimes ordinary citizens do manage 
to maneuver within the tightly controlled public discourse by taking advantage of 
autonomous spaces or networks to articulate and discuss their ideas and even ﬁnd 
ways to seriously oppose the authoritarian political regime. 
In the Internet age, countries may also have and use capabilities to inﬂuence the 
information that reaches the populations of other countries. For example, the Russian 
government “actively undermines the rule of law and free democracy both in the 
domestic political processes and the political processes of other states” (Hamer et al., 
2019, 53). Russia uses espionage and disinformation to undermine the democratic 
process and to destabilize a foreign society. The country is suspected of actively 
spreading disinformation on various occasions, from undermining the American 
presidential elections in 2016, to inﬂuencing the American mid-term elections in 
2018, and targeting the Yellow Vests movement in France. 
Media—the (technical) mediation of the public sphere 
Above, we mentioned the central role that traditional and social media play in the 
public sphere. Habermas considered the press to be the most important catalyst 
of the bourgeois public sphere of the eighteenth century (cf. Peters, 1993). In the 
twentieth century, besides newspapers, radio and television became inﬂuential means 
to broadcast information. Habermas was highly critical of the role of such mass 
media. In the early 1960s, he stated that in modern European nations mass media 
had become “the gate through which privileged private interests invaded the public 
sphere” (Habermas, 1989, 185). He argued that the acquisition of the control of mass 
media—such as newspapers, radio, and TV—by private owners and their relationship 
with the political class had made “manipulative publicity” common and had led to 
the so-called refeudalization of the public sphere. Commercialization of the news

83
media also led to people being approached as consumers, and little attention was 
paid to critical discourse and raising political awareness among citizens. As a result, 
Calhoun argues that, “With the loss of a notion of a general interest and the rise of 
a consumption orientation, the members of the public lost their common ground” 
(Calhoun, 1992: 25). 
We now live in the Internet age. In the early days of the Internet, the popular utopian 
vision was that the Internet could serve as a global public sphere with the potential 
to reshape democracy. It was thought that in contrast to the passive consumption of 
mass media, the Internet would provide a new well-informed public sphere, where 
citizens could form active Internet communities, with room for criticism, arguments, 
and unmanipulated power-free discussion among all kinds of people and views. In 
the meantime, various scholars worry that phenomena such as ﬁlter bubbles and 
digital echo-chambers cause isolated self-referential public spheres that increase 
ideological segregation. Flaxman et al. (2016) found that social networks and search 
engines both increase the mean ideological distance between individuals as well as 
increase an individual’s exposure to material from their less-preferred side of the 
political spectrum. Also, much attention has been paid to the ways in which the 
use of the Internet and social media in combination with big tech dominance can put 
pressure on democracy. This discussion is fueled by the fact that the public debate has 
turned into a revenue model by large social media companies, like Facebook, Twitter, 
and Google. Moreover, the Internet has been ﬂooded with “fake news,” or more 
speciﬁcally: mis-information (incorrect information), mal-information (information 
based on reality, used to harm a person, organization or country), and disinformation 
(dissemination of misleading information with the aim of harming public debate and 
democratic processes) (cf. Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017). For example, Myanmar 
military ofﬁcials misused Facebook to set up a systematic hate-speech campaign 
to target a Muslim Rohingya minority, which has led to murder, rape, and forced 
migration (cf. Stevenson, 2018). 
Science and technology—knowledge as a resource and problem of modern public 
spheres 
In our technological culture, identifying and addressing public issues is often highly 
dependent on scientiﬁc knowledge and technological expertise, capabilities, and 
instruments. Science and technology play at least three roles (cf. Beck, 1992, 163). 
First, the industrial use of science and technologies creates social beneﬁts and risks. 
Second, science and technology provide means to recognize and measure physical 
risks, but also indicate and articulate social and ethical issues related to technologies. 
And ﬁnally, science and technology can be used to deal with risks in the best possible 
way. With his book The public and its problems (1927), Dewey (2016) was one of the 
ﬁrst to draw attention to the role of scientiﬁc and technological expertise in decision-
making and the citizen’s dependence on the knowledge of experts. Dewey identiﬁed 
science and technology as a main source of public problems in modern societies 
and thus as drivers of public debates and the emergence of new publics. As stated 
above, citizens depend on the state to address their needs effectively. Often, however, 
existing state institutions are incapable of addressing these new public needs and are

84
R. van Est and L. Hennen
hostile to those needs because they have been organized to serve the sometimes-
conﬂicting interests of other publics. As Dewey (2016, 80–81) puts it, “The new 
public which is generated remains long inchoate, unorganized, because it cannot 
use inherited political agencies. The latter, if elaborate and well institutionalized, 
obstruct the organization of the new public. … To form itself, the public has to break 
existing political forms.” Therefore, according to Dewey, publics must ﬁrst develop 
outside the incumbent institutions of the state, until they are powerful enough to 
function as a counterweight to publics that are entrenched via the state and change 
the institutions of that state. “This, for Dewey, is the essence of democracy’s radical 
character.” (Rogers, 2016, 42). 
At the same time, science and technology development is a challenge for publics 
due to the complexity of the issues at stake. The difﬁculties in capturing the 
complexity of problems and identifying possible options for action can stymie the 
effective articulation of problems and thus the emergence of active public debates: 
“The ramiﬁcation of the issues before the public is so wide and intricate, the tech-
nical matters involved so specialized, the details are so many and so shifting, that 
the public cannot for any length of time identify and hold itself” (Dewey, 2016: 
166). With the new emerging roles of experts and laypeople, it becomes decisive 
for citizens to fulﬁll their democratic role to be provided with reliable knowledge in 
order to be able “to judge of the bearing of the knowledge supplied by others upon 
common concerns” (Dewey, 2016, 225). It is at this intersection of expertise, public 
opinion-forming, and policymaking where institutions such as (parliamentary) TA 
organizations are situated, and through which they deﬁne their roles (see below and 
Hennen, 2021). 
3.2 
STS-Like Public Spheres and TA 
Since TA deals with the relationship between technological change and social prob-
lems, it has a strong public and political dimension (van Est & Brom, 2012). The 
practice of TA thus recognizes the important role that science and technology play 
in society and in political decision-making. Ganzevles et al. (2014) model (parlia-
mentary) TA as an activity at the interplay between society (including citizens and 
civil society organizations), politics (including parliament and government), and 
science and technology. TA thus functions as a mediator among the actors and their 
knowledge claims in these spheres. So, interestingly, STS-like public spheres and 
TA practices populate the same in-between spaces. 
Related to this, it is important to recall that TA owes its existence to the emergence 
in the 1960s and 1970s of a public sphere that was critical of science and technology 
and the way politics dealt with it. Important new public issues included environmental 
pollution, car safety, nuclear energy, and the impact of information technology on 
employment. Societal criticism was that politics and policy failed to deal with the 
negative effects of technological change in a timely and adequate manner. And there 
was a social call for the democratization of science and technology and related

political decision-making. One of the political responses in various Western countries 
was the establishment of parliamentary TA organizations. Parliamentary TA was 
ﬁrst institutionalized in the United States in 1972 with the founding of the Ofﬁce 
of Technology Assessment (OTA) as part of the American Congress. Inspired by 
this event, in the 1980s, parliamentary TA took root in various European countries, 
starting with OPECTS in France, which was established in 1983 by law “to inform 
Parliament of the consequences of the choice of scientiﬁc and technological options, 
in particular, so as to enable it to make enlightened decisions.”2 
TA is often deﬁned as “a scientiﬁc, interactive, and communicative process that 
aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects 
of science and technology” (Bütschi et al., 2004, 14). Given the intermediary role 
of TA in the triangle between society, politics, and science and society, TA can thus 
focus on studying these domains and their interactions, informing the players in those 
domains and stimulating their engagement in the debate about the social signiﬁcance 
of science and technology. As a result, we can describe the relationship between TA 
and STS-like public spheres (and also with politics and science and technology) 
along three dimensions, namely from the perspective of studying, informing, and 
engaging (cf. Hennen, 2021). 
First, STS-like public spheres are objects of study for TA. This makes much 
sense, since public controversies surrounding science and technology can be seen as 
informal forms of TA that in many cases “provide partly conﬂicting assessments of 
new technologies or of the impacts of actual or proposed projects, that are further 
articulated and consolidated in the course of a controversy. Thus, informal technology 
assessment occurs.” (Rip, 1986, 350). So, by studying the positions and discussions in 
the public sphere, TA tries to gain insight into the way in which citizens, stakeholders, 
and experts perceive the social signiﬁcance of science and technology. 
The classic role of parliamentary TA is to inform parliaments (representatives of 
the people) about the state of public debate. But parliamentary TA may also be tasked 
with informing the general public. In such a case, the public sphere is regarded as 
the addressee of TA, based on the idea that insights from TA studies can contribute 
to the quality of the public debate about science, technology, and society. 
In line with this lies the third dimension, in which engaging society and thus 
stimulating the public sphere is seen as an explicit task for a TA organization. This 
is the realm of participatory TA, which deals with the interface between the (polit-
ical) decision-making arena and society (van Est & Brom, 2012). Participatory TA 
intellectually connects to the Habermasian model of discourse ethics (Dalton-Brown, 
2015, 109), and in general to a deliberative model of democracy, in which it is consid-
ered important to confront actors with the political views of other actors. The aim 
of participatory TA is to broaden, and thus enrich, the political and public debate 
around the social aspects of science and technology. This mode of TA organizes 
the involvement of experts, stakeholders, and citizens to identify and evaluate the

societal impact of technological change. A large toolbox of participatory methods 
has been developed for this purpose, including citizens’ panels, scenario workshops, 
and consensus conferences (Joss & Bellucci, 2002; Slocum-Bradley, 2003). 
A question that arose in the context of public controversies surrounding biotech-
nology in the 1990s is when should citizens and societal actors be involved in the 
development of science and technology? In the ﬁeld of nanotechnology, it was feared 
that this development could also lead to a great deal of public controversy. This gave 
rise to the idea that civil society organizations and the general public should be 
involved in the development of nanotechnology at an early stage. In this way, the 
notion of “upstream public engagement” entered the existing discourse on public 
participation (cf. Wilsdon & Willis, 2004). This created a window of opportunity in 
the United States and Europe to organize social participation not only around tech-
nology that was already on the market, but also in science, and decisions about the 
R&D agenda. Public engagement is thus not placed here between the public sphere 
and politics, but between the public sphere, and science and technology.

Public Spheres in a Context of Globalization 
In the previous section, we discussed public spheres and their relationship with TA in 
the context of the political sphere of the nation state. However, the nation state and its 
politics are part of a bigger world. Since each country depends on other countries— 
politically, economically, environmentally, socio-culturally, and also with regard 
to science and technology—interdependence deﬁnes the state of the world (see 
Hennen and van Est, this volume). From that perspective, globalization refers to 
“a trend of increasing transnational ﬂows and increasing thick networks of interde-
pendence.” (Keohane, 2002, 15). This raises the question of how we can interpret 
the relationship between the public spheres and TA in a context of globalization. 
First, we will look at the public sphere in the context of globalization. We show 
that the globalized media landscape provides tools for people around the globe to 
make local issues visible at a global level. Then, we argue, on the basis of the political 
European Community, that there is not yet a real transnational European political 
space or public sphere, let alone a global one. At the same time, there is a so-
called internal globalization or cosmopolitanization of the identity and perception 
of (in particular young) people all over the world. This condition implies that for 
successful action, people and states must always take into account and make use 
of the opportunities that so-called cosmopolitanized action spaces offer. We then 
describe two examples of cosmopolitanized public spheres for collective action. 
Visualized global media landscape 
Originally, Habermas discussed public spheres mainly in the context of modern 
democratic European nation states, territorially bounded political community, 
national economy, national media, and linguistic and cultural homogeneity (Fraser, 
2007). A quick reﬂection on these elements shows that globalization has radically

Technology Assessment and Public Spheres in the Context …
87
changed the context in which public opinion may form and lead to action. We now 
live in a highly networked global-knowledge economy, in a multicultural society 
(partly as a result of centuries of enslavement and decades of colonial, labor and 
asylum migration). At the start of 2021, there were almost 4.7 billion active Internet 
users worldwide, some 60% of the global population3 with a similar number of TV 
viewers. The widespread use of television and Internet has created a visualized global 
media landscape, where local or personal issues can become national or even global 
concerns. 
Increased means for global exposure 
We can safely say that this media landscape has greatly increased the possibilities 
for many people to publicize their personal experiences with particular problems and 
solutions worldwide, accompanied by transparency about what is happening in the 
world (the ﬁrst requirement for creating public spheres). Think of Wikileaks, and 
famous whistleblowers in the ﬁeld of IT, like Edward Snowden, who in 2013 revealed 
numerous American global surveillance programs, or Christopher Wylie, whose reve-
lations in 2018 prompted the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Another 
interesting example is the online campaign called Ushahidi (“testimony” in Swahili), 
which was launched by a group of concerned Kenyans (in and outside of Kenya) to 
raise awareness about the violence that was spreading the country after fraudulent 
elections took place at the end of 2007. This crisis-mapping tool was incorporated into 
Google Maps and enabled the crowdsourcing of testimonies of ordinary people, who 
could share what they saw and perceived almost in real time through SMS, tweets, 
Facebook messages, mobile camera photos, Skype chat logs, and voice recordings. 
The originator of the idea for such a platform, Ory Okolloh, a Kenyan female lawyer 
in South Africa, stated: “the idea behind crowdsourcing is that with enough volume, 
a ‘truth’ emerges that diminishes any false reports” (Okolloh, 2009, p). At the time, 
this reporting of violence was a new form of public engagement of citizens in Kenya 
and the Kenyan transnational diaspora (Goldstein & Rotich, 2008). 
No generic pan-European or global public sphere 
Citizens can thus obtain information about what is happening around the world and 
make it visible via traditional and social media. But in what way does this trans-
parency also lead to collective understanding, collective public action, and perhaps 
also political action? Let us ﬁrst look at the European Union, because a transnational 
European public sphere still seems to ﬁt well with the Habermasian model (for an 
overview of the discussion on the problems of a European public sphere see Hennen, 
2020). While there are European citizens who have freedom of expression, the right 
to vote, and the possibility to start a European citizens’ initiative, there is also a 
European political sovereign, embodied by the European Parliament, the European 
Commission, and the European Council which includes the heads of government of 
the member countries. The opinion of EU law professor Alberto Alemanno is quite

R. van Est and L. Hennen
sobering: “We don’t yet have a European politics – there’s no real pan-European 
public opinion, no transnational political debate or dialogue on the issues that affect 
our common interests as Europeans – unemployment, the environment, migration, 
data protection. But as the need increases, it’s starting to come.” (quoted in Henley, 
2019). Mak, a historian (2019, 152), agrees with this analysis and states (subtly refer-
ring to Habermas) that “the dreamed European coffee house, where a permanent 
public street debate takes place, only slowly got off the ground.” 
All transnational political bodies, including the European Union, face the 
problem of institutionally restricted options to directly refer and relate to a speciﬁc 
constituency. This causes problems in legitimizing its policies, as well as hampering 
the emergence of a transnational public sphere to which it can relate. In order to 
improve this situation, a democratization of transnational political institutions is 
required, alongside the development of an active transnational civil society and a felt 
transnational citizenship. As regards the latter, there are indications that together with 
the globalization of political problems and issues, a cosmopolitan perspective and 
identity of publics is emerging, which the technical options provided by the Internet 
support (see Hennen and van Est, this volume). 
Internal globalization of the public sphere 
One signal that this process of Europeanization of the political and public sphere 
is underway is the recent emergence of truly transnational, pan-European political 
parties, such as Volt. In addition, many young people, fueled by global issues such as 
migration, climate change, and security, and socialized in the sphere of the network 
society, are forming a cosmopolitan identity (Volkmer, 2014). A study among 14- to 
17-year-olds in mid-sized cities in nine countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Kenya, 
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, and Trinidad & Tobago) shows that 
this group “collectively share the engagement in social media (Facebook), partici-
pates through a transnational angle in transnational events, and engages collectively in 
concerns of a globalized nature, human rights, the environment, … military conﬂicts 
and war” (ibid., 183–184). About half of these youngsters perceive themselves as 
citizens of the world, and half as citizens of their country, while a majority is inter-
ested in information about the world (ibid., 185). As a result, Volkmer (2014, 184) 
positions this new generation “between the lifeworld ‘locality’ and the globalized 
public.” 
So we see that globalization leads to a reﬂexive process where (young) people 
start to think and act, taking into account the position of themselves and their country 
within a transnational and/or global context. Beck (2005, 143) speaks of “the ‘internal 
globalization’ or ‘cosmopolitanization’ of nation state societies from within,” and of 
cosmopolitan realism, which in order to be successful forces people and countries 
to make strategic use of “cosmopolitanized spaces for action” (Beck, 2016). Below 
we brieﬂy discuss two examples of cosmopolitanized public spheres for collective 
action: a pre-Internet and a post-Internet example. One example concerns the histor-
ical struggle against apartheid in South Africa, where activists purposefully built 
incrementally a public sphere with global scope in order to increase foreign pres-
sure for change on the national political regime. The second example concerns the

contemporary formation of a global public sphere that includes, among other things, 
a diverse global assemblage of climate activists who exert political pressure at both 
the national and global political levels. 
Anti-apartheid movement—building a global counter-public4 
The anti-apartheid movement was increasingly globally active from around 1960 
(the Sharpeville massacre occurred on March 21, 1961) to 1994, when apartheid 
was formally abolished in South Africa (Thörn, 2007). The movement intentionally 
contributed to that political regime shift by prompting disinvestments by global 
corporations and stimulating nation states and supranational organizations, such as 
the United Nations, European Economic Community (EEC), and Organisation of 
African Unity (OAU), to boycott South Africa. Besides South Africa, the movement 
took organizational shape in, among others, the United Kingdom. Its long history 
shows that it took decades to build a global anti-apartheid counter-public and that 
informal contacts and networks between anti-apartheid activists within South Africa 
and in exile, and activists in other countries played a central role. The national, 
international, and transnational dimensions of this social movement dominated its 
global aspect (ibid., 911). 
The anti-apartheid movement employed two interrelated information and commu-
nication strategies, before the Internet age: (1) inﬂuencing and achieving visibility 
in the established media to communicate their message to the public and (2) devel-
oping alternative media and information networks with a global reach in order to 
create an independent, “alternative public sphere that would make it possible to 
address publics directly, thus freeing the movement from any dependence on global 
media industries” (ibid., 906). For the second approach, archives of well-researched 
information material and photographs were built up, and news bulletins, magazines, 
ﬁlms, and videos about the apartheid regime and resistance to it were produced and 
distributed to members and sold publicly. These products created an important base 
for attracting established media. The International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF) 
played a central role in collecting and producing information material and made it 
easily accessible for other anti-apartheid organizations, as well as to journalists and 
a global public. Connected to the global media revolution, cultural events became 
crucial means to attract global media attention to the movement during the 1980s. 
Most important were the Nelson Mandela Tribute concerts in 1988 and 1990 that 
ﬁlled the Wembley stadium in London and were broadcast globally by the BBC. 
Inﬂuencing national and global decision-making on climate change 
At the international and global level, there is not always a decision-making body 
through and upon which the public sphere can exert political inﬂuence. However, 
such a visible decision-making platform does exist in the ﬁeld of climate policy. 
The Conference of Parties (COP) is the highest decision-making body of the United 
Nations Climate Change Framework Convention (UNFCCC), consisting of world 
leaders from 189 nations. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol—which operationalizes the

R. van Est and L. Hennen
UNFCCC by committing countries to limit and reduce greenhouse gases emissions 
in accordance with agreed individual targets—was adopted during COP3 and entered 
into force in 2005. Since 2005, civil society organizations have collaborated world-
wide to inﬂuence decisions regarding the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. 
Actions have taken place at country level all over the globe, as well as wherever a 
COP-meeting took place. 
The First Meeting of Parties (MOP1) to the Kyoto Protocol was held in conjunc-
tion with COP11 in 2005, in Montreal, Canada. This was the reason for environmental 
organizations to begin organizing a Global Day of Climate Action; peaceful demon-
strations in many countries around the world, to inﬂuence the delegates to honor the 
commitments made in the Kyoto Protocol.5 In 2015, these protests were given new 
impetus by the contribution of young climate activists. On the ﬁrst day of the Paris 
climate summit (COP21), a worldwide Climate Strike was organized by students in 
over 100 countries, in which over 50,000 people participated. In 2018, this global 
youth movement was given impetus by the political actions of 15-year-old Greta 
Thunberg, who, in the run-up to the Swedish general elections on 9 September, 
started protesting every day during school hours for better climate policy in front of 
the Swedish parliament. Her slogan “Fridays For Future” gained worldwide atten-
tion and inspired school students across the globe, leading to various Global Climate 
Strikes. For example, in relation to the UN Climate Action Summit held in New York 
on 23 September 2019, several million students participated in climate strikes across 
150 countries.6 
A kaleidoscopic image 
We might say that many countries have a generic national public sphere that is 
the result of many decades, if not centuries, of institution-formation, in the sense 
of, among other things, the national education system, political system, and media 
landscape. There is no such thing as a generic public sphere on a European scale, 
let alone on a global scale, although this may be developing very slowly. Diverse 
formative elements that have developed in recent decades include a global economy, 
a global (youth) culture, and a global visualized media landscape. The latter offers 
numerous possibilities for making local issues visible on a global scale, and for 
making global issues visible locally, as well as to comment on and discuss these. 
As a result, young people (in particular) increasingly see themselves as national and 
global citizens, although from a political-legal perspective there is as yet no such 
thing as a global citizen. Globalization is thus internalized in their thinking and also 
in the national public sphere. There is still a large gap between awareness-building 
and common understanding of certain global issues, and collective action to inﬂuence 
political decision-making at national and international levels. But we have showed 
two examples where this has succeeded.

Archiving of events, evidence, and statements and connecting to the global cultural 
public sphere via, e.g., pop concerts played an important role in the success of 
the anti-apartheid movement. And in recent years, teens have played an important 
role in the global climate movement. Both examples show a complex interaction 
between local, national, international, transnational, and global dimensions of the 
public sphere. In relation to this and in order to inﬂuence political decision-making, 
the public sphere relates in many ways to different levels of government, again from 
the local and national to the international and global level, whereby the messages 
are also aimed at multinationals. The dimensions of the multi-level public sphere 
surrounding a particular issue thus mirror the multi-level governance of the issue in 
question. The political success of such complex-layered globalized public spheres 
is still largely based on personal connections within and across countries. Although 
the youth-organized global climate strike movement shows that conveying a global 
message nowadays is relatively easier than in the days of the anti-apartheid move-
ment, achieving political and social change still takes a lot of time and energy, and 
the slow, tiresome building of institutions (Olesen, 2005). 
5 
TA Beyond National Borders 
Above, we reﬂected on public spheres in a globalized context. In this section, we 
look at the organization of TA and its activities beyond national borders. In the ﬁnal 
section, we reﬂect on the relationship between S&T-like public spheres and TA in a 
context of globalization. When thinking about TA in America’s twenty-ﬁrst century, 
Sclove (2010, 37f) identiﬁed two organizational routes. The ﬁrst “Congressional 
option” is where a TA organization is directly linked to Congress, or in general a 
particular political decision-making body, which we will call the “Decision-Making 
Body option.” According to Sclove (2010), a second option would be to establish an 
“expert-and-participatory TA capability by connecting an appropriate set of indepen-
dent, non-partisan, and non-proﬁt organizations into a nation-wide network” (ibid. 
38), the so-called Institutional Network option. Both routes are used to organize both 
expert-based and participatory TA capabilities at an international level (Table 1). We 
will look at Europe ﬁrst, before discussing the TA situation at a global level.
5.1 
European Level 
The classic role for (parliamentary) TA of informing political decision-making bodies 
is also organized at the EU level. STOA, the TA ofﬁce of the European Parliament, 
is an example at central European political and administrative level. In addition 
to this Decision-Making Body option, the Institutional Network option is also used. 
Since 1990, international cooperation has taken place within European Parliamentary 
Technology Assessment (EPTA), a network of national TA institutions specialized

network has a light organizational structure, and each year its members produce 
jointly an EPTA report which provides an up-to-date international overview of 
policies linked to a current TA topic. 
This Institutional Network option has been used several times to organize partic-
ipatory TA at European and global level. The ﬁrst transnational participatory TA 
project was Meeting of Minds, the European Citizens’ Deliberation on Brain Science, 
which aimed to rectify the lack of public debate on brain research in Europe (Rauws, 
2010). The two-year pilot project was led by a panel of 126 randomly selected citizens 
from nine countries. A partner consortium of TA bodies, science museums, academic 
institutions, and public foundations launched this initiative in 2005 with the ﬁnan-
cial support of the European Commission and the King Baudouin Foundation. The 
participating citizens discussed matters in their own national panels, but also gath-
ered together in two meetings in Brussels. At the end of the second international 
meeting in January 2006, the citizens’ report was presented to the European Parlia-
ment. The panel’s results have also been presented and disseminated at individual 
country levels. 
5.2 
Transnational and Global Level 
TA is also organized at a global level on the basis of the Decision-Making Body 
option (Ladikas and Stamm, this volume). Part of the work of the IPCC also ﬁts this 
option. The IPCC serves as the core scientiﬁc advisory board delivering evidence-
based climate policy recommendations based on global scientiﬁc data to international 
climate negotiations. A key element of the advice from the IPCC is to assess the 
potential societal impacts of mitigation technologies, which is at the heart of TA 
(Ashworth and Clarke, this volume). The work of the IPCC also greatly inﬂuences 
the public debate in many countries around the world. 
Considering the Institutional Network option, there has been a Global TA network 
since 2018. This network now consists of 28 non-proﬁt institutions from around the

world, working together in the area of science and technology, to promote respon-
sible and sustainable research and innovation to tackle global grand challenges. The 
development of this book is the ﬁrst joint TA-related activity, which aims to better 
understand the idea of global TA, contemporary practices, and its desired future. The 
big challenge for the Global TA network is to ﬁnd organizations in developing coun-
tries with experience in the ﬁeld of TA, as TA is much less common in non-OECD 
countries, while the need for TA is certainly no less. 
The Institutional Network option has also been deployed to organize participatory 
TA on a global scale. The World Wide Views on Global Warming (WWViews) project 
represents a globe-encompassing participatory TA exercise (Bedsted & Klüver, 
2009). WWViews enabled citizens from all over the world to deﬁne and communicate 
their positions on issues central to the UN Climate Change negotiations (COP15), 
in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009. The project was coordinated by the 
Danish Board of Technology (DBT) and implemented by a global alliance of indi-
viduals and institutions, including governmental and non-governmental organiza-
tions, parliamentary TA organizations, and universities. On 26 September 2009, the 
various partners hosted one-day face-to-face deliberations in 38 nations, including 
Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Russia, the United States, and various European 
and African nations. Each deliberation included about 90 people, so that about 4000 
people worldwide were involved. 
In the ﬁeld of participatory TA, it is not easy to ﬁnd suitable partners in devel-
oping countries. However, there are some examples of participatory TA events. For 
example, in 2010, the Ministry of Environment and Forests undertook a large-scale 
public consultation for the ﬁrst time ever in India, concerning the commercial release 
of the ﬁrst GM food crop in that country. Ely et al. (2014) list some examples of 
participatory TA activities, such as citizen’s juries, that have taken place in particular 
in the ﬁeld of agricultural biotechnology in Brazil, Mali, and Zimbabwe, and reﬂect 
on three international participatory TA projects: 
• The International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Tech-
nology for Development (IAASTD) cost some $15 million and was funded by the 
World Bank, UNDP, FAO, and other institutions. Its aim was to provide a global 
consensus for investing in agricultural science and technology, setting priorities 
for both national and global organizations. The four-year TA project started in 
2003 was global in scope and resulted in ﬁve regional reports and one global 
report. It involved some 900 stakeholders across 110 countries from multiple 
institutions in public, civil, and private sectors. 
• The second TA project was sponsored by the British Royal Society and organized 
by the British think-tank DEMOS and Lancaster University, to explore the role 
of new nanotechnologies in clean water provision, through stakeholder events 
in Nepal, Peru, and Zimbabwe. The Royal Society wanted to look beyond the 
perspective of Western societies and take account of how people in developing 
societies might respond to nanotech-developments and their impacts. 
• Finally, in 2008 the UK Research Council sponsored a TA project to identify 
maize-based farming strategies in Kenya as a means to respond to climate change.

STS-Like Public Spheres and TA in a Context 
of Globalization 
In Sect. 3, we saw that globalization affects local and national levels and even impacts 
personal identity and opinion-formation. The public sphere is becoming globalized, 
especially through the globalization of the national public sphere. This means that the 
international expansion of public spheres and the internal globalization of national 
public spheres are taking place simultaneously. However, the latter process seems to 
be developing more quickly as it is embedded in existing national public, media, and 
political institutions. This is often not the case internationally, as illustrated in the ﬁeld 
of TA in Sect. 4, where we described the weakness of the institutionalization of TA 
in developing countries and at the international level. This ﬁnal section looks at the 
relationship between STS-like public spheres and TA, in a context of globalization. 
In Sect. 1, we introduced the all-affected principle, which in the TA context means 
that all who are affected by science and technology should have a right to participate 
in decision-making about it. Based on the all-affected principle, globalization sets 
additional demands on the theory and practice of TA, both at the national level 
and beyond. Since science and technology and their social consequences are global 
phenomena, TA should, according to the all-affected principle, take into account the 
groups of people that are affected worldwide, and not only in the country where TA is 
organized. Below, we reﬂect on how globalization, including science and technology 
and the public sphere, challenges TA and its connection to the public sphere on both 
a national and international level. Analogous to Sect. 2, we use the tripartite division 
between TA activities that study the public sphere, inform the public sphere, and 
stimulate and involve the public sphere (cf. Hennen, 2021). 
6.1 
National TA as a Site of Globalization 
TA is institutionalized in many OECD countries, but not in many developing coun-
tries. So there is literally still a world to win. Here, we focus on countries with TA 
capacity. Like the nation state and national public spheres, national TA has become a 
site of globalization. Based on the all-affected principle, globalization forces national 
TA, which also values inclusivity, to broaden its ﬁeld of view with regard to public 
spheres (cf. Ely et al., 2014). 
Central questions for TA activities are which scientiﬁc and technological develop-
ments to address and which groups affected by those developments will be included 
in a TA study. The globalization perspective calls for special attention for groups 
that are often not included, such as cultural minorities or new immigrant citizens,

Technology Assessment and Public Spheres in the Context …
95
young people with an internalized global perspective, and groups in other countries, 
especially developing countries, who experience the consequences of new scientiﬁc 
and technological developments. Minorities can be much affected by developments 
such as ethnic proﬁling and AI, and the robotization of warehouses, but may lack 
the time, language skills, and organizational capacity to organize themselves into 
an active public and make themselves heard in the public debate. It is perhaps even 
more difﬁcult to make visible and audible those groups from other countries who 
are affected by, for example, the testing of medicines, the dumping of electronic 
waste, or IVF through international surrogacy. A category that is easily left out are 
those migrants who do not have civilian status in any country. This means that the 
globalization perspective should also be taken into account when selecting topics 
for TA studies—such as the role of technology in migration policy (Dijstelbloem & 
Meijer, 2009). 
Paying attention to the groups identiﬁed above also has consequences for 
informing the public sphere and the various audiences within it. Informing them 
may require translation of results into speciﬁc languages, and the use of interpreters 
during debates. Translations into English in particular ensure that the results can be 
disseminated worldwide. 
With regard to the stimulation of S&T-like public spheres through participatory 
TA activities, the choice of topics and participating groups also plays a role. Above, 
we saw that the Royal Society choose a global perspective on nanotechnology and 
organized stakeholder discussions in Nepal, Peru, and Zimbabwe. Reﬂecting on the 
transnationalization of the public sphere, Couldry wonders how Polish minorities 
can be given a more prominent place in the British public debate and states: “Don’t 
the voices of migrant workers in Britain, and indeed their families abroad that depend 
on their remitted income, need to be heard more in British media than at present?” 
(Couldry, 2014, 55). Modern media makes it possible to give people from all over 
the world a voice in a national debate. When involving the viewpoints of people 
internationally, cooperation with TA practitioners in other countries can be sought. 
In this way, the TA capacity in such countries can also be strengthened. This brings 
us to the topic of TA and public spheres beyond national borders. 
6.2 
TA and Public Spheres Beyond National Borders 
A reﬂection on TA and public spheres beyond national borders should start with 
two observations. First, there is as yet no such thing as a European, let alone global, 
political, and public sphere. From a global perspective, there is a patchwork from 
democratic to authoritarian public spheres. At the same time, we have shown two 
examples—the anti-apartheid and climate change movements—in which civil society 
actors succeeded through sustained effort in building public spheres of global scope

that have had cultural and political inﬂuence at national and global levels. Both move-
ments simultaneously constructed national counter-publics and a global counter-
public, which both interacted and also acted autonomously (cf. Thörn, 2007, 912). 
Moreover, these movements democratically transformed public spheres. 
The second remark concerns the global state of TA. Overall, the institutional-
ization and ﬁnancing of TA in many developing countries and at an international 
level are still relatively weak. At the same time, we outlined a wide range of expert-
based and participatory TA activities carried out by TA organizations and networks 
at both European and global level. Table 1 therefore shows what is possible in prin-
ciple in the ﬁeld of international TA and thus outlines a kind of blueprint for the 
future of global TA. That blueprint consists of a mix of Decision-Making Body and 
Institutional Network options to organize expert-based and participatory TA at an 
international level. Unfortunately, the Decision-Making body route is currently not 
used to organize participatory TA activities. 
So what are the possibilities for TA at an international level to research, inform, 
and stimulate S&T-like public spheres? The need and potential for TA to do such 
things beyond national borders are strong, but are used far too little, because the lack 
of political vision and capacity means that both institutionalization and funding lag 
behind. As the history of the anti-apartheid and climate change movements shows, 
building a public sphere with global reach can take decades. The same goes for Euro-
pean and global TA. The ﬁrst forms of expert-based TA according to the Decision-
Making Body option at European level (see STOA) and global level, including both 
democratic and authoritarian states (see IPCC), arose in the second half of the 1980s. 
Expert-based TA according to the Institutional Network route was set up in Europe in 
1990 (EPTA) and was recently established on a worldwide scale in 2018 (Global TA 
network). Participatory TA was organized at the European level between 2005 and 
2007 (Meeting of Minds) and at the global level between 2008 and 2009 (World Wide 
Views on Global Warming). All such international TA activities can in principle be 
expanded and should be expanded from the perspective of globalization of science 
and technology and its consequences. According to the blueprint of Table 1, we can 
think of expanding the Global TA network and its funding so that the network can 
carry out international expert-based and participatory TA activities. Or, by analogy 
with the IPCC, we can think of setting up an Intergovernmental Panel on Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence or Synthetic Biology. So although much is desirable and possible, a lack 
of political vision will often stand between dream and action.

Technology Assessment in Developing 
Countries: The Case of India—Examples 
of Governmental and Informal TA 
Krishna Ravi Srinivas and Rinie van Est 
1 Introduction 
Technology assessment (TA) has a rich history of more than ﬁfty years. Especially, 
in many developed countries, TA is part of the institutional framework surrounding 
science, technology, and innovation (STI), or part of the policy advice system that 
enables parliaments to understand, debate, and decide on STI issues. TA is a generic 
term and there is a broad variety of different types and practices of TA (cf. van 
Est & Brom, 2012). TA can be considered as a stand-alone exercise or policy tool, 
or may be used with other policy tools, including analysis of ethical, legal, and 
social issues (regularly abbreviated as ELSI). According to Grunwald, TA should 
“enrich technology governance by integrating any available knowledge on possible 
side effects at the early stage of decision-making processes, by supporting the evalu-
ation of technologies against a broad set of societal values and ethical principles, by 
elaborating strategies to deal with the inevitable uncertainties, and by contributing 
to the constructive handling of societal conﬂicts” (Grunwald, 2019, 702). He also 
suggests anticipation, inclusion, and complexity as three conceptual dimensions of 
TA (Grunwald, 2019, 704). 
In most developing countries, TA is weakly institutionalized, or not at all. This 
has little to do with the fact that TA is not relevant for developing countries. For 
example, in the context of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG), Ely et al. 
(2011) underscored the need for TA for developing countries. Moreover, UNCTAD,

which is the part of the United Nations Secretariat dealing with trade, investment, 
and development issues, currently sees a growing interest in TA and points out its 
relevance for sustainable development. In 2021, UNCTAD (2021, 82) launched the 
project, “Technology assessment in the energy and agricultural sectors in Africa to 
accelerate progress on Science, Technology and Innovation,” which aims to build 
capacity in three African countries to carry out technology assessments in the energy 
and agricultural sectors, and to utilize technologies as catalysts for sustainable devel-
opment. If TA is to contribute to sustainable development, particularly in meeting 
the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), what needs to be done? If we see 
TA as an important practice for developing countries, then how can that practice 
be institutionalized? And if developing countries do not have robust STI policies, 
and have weak institutions for doing TA, will the typical TA approach work, or is a 
modiﬁed form of TA needed? 
This chapter examines TA in India, as an example of a developing country, and 
describes various types of TA being undertaken by different actors. It is argued that 
in developing countries like India, where the state plays a major role in stimulating 
and regulating STI, civil society may provide an important alternative perspective 
on STI, which may lead to STI becoming a contested terrain. Societal engagement 
may also support alternative forms of innovation that are not initially recognized 
by the formal innovation system. In this way, civil society may pave the way for 
more participation in STI and/or may lead to a further institutionalization of TA 
practices—similarly to what happened historically in European countries such as 
Denmark and the Netherlands. 
As Rip (1986) and Cambrosio and Limoges (1991) have argued, both societal 
deliberations on and controversies surrounding STI can be considered as informal 
processes of TA. Such informal TA activities may open up spaces for citizens and 
societal stakeholders to intervene in the development and decision-making processes 
around STI. Moreover, formal TA can be considered either as a social process working 
largely in a space created by societal controversies, or as the wish to prevent such 
controversies. The role of public controversies around STI is relevant in each country, 
but likely even more so in developing countries, where formal TA is weakly insti-
tutionalized. We will argue, therefore, that both formal and informal TA are needed 
and can complement each other. So any study on TA in developing countries should 
go beyond the traditional view of TA. This is exactly what we want to do in this 
chapter. 
For this, we can use the institutional perspective provided by Ganzevles et al. 
(2014) on the TA landscape. These authors model TA as an activity at the interplay 
between four spheres: parliament, government, science and technology, and society. 
TA can act as a mediator of knowledge and actors between these spheres. In the litera-
ture, there is relatively more attention for TA directed towards members of parliament, 
known as Parliamentary TA (PTA), that is: “technology assessment specially aimed 
at informing and contributing to opinion formation of the members of parliament as 
main clients of the TA activity” (Enzing et al., 2011, i) But actors from the three other 
spheres can also act as clients of TA. In cases, where scientists and engineers are the

main addressees, TA can be used as a means to guide research and technology devel-
opment from a societal perspective. The term constructive technology assessment is 
regularly used to pinpoint TA that is aimed at inﬂuencing technological choice and 
design processes (Schot & Rip, 1997). Policy-makers are also potential clients of 
TA. The task of TA is then to inform them about the societal aspects of science and 
technology. TA activities can also be aimed at the general public in order to stimulate 
the public debate on science and technology in society. 
India has no parliamentary TA organization. Most TA-like activities and prac-
tices are organized by and for governmental agencies. Such policy advising TA has 
been somewhat en vogue, although the term TA is not usually explicitly mentioned. 
Section 3 describes three examples of governmental TA in India. First, the central 
role played by the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council 
(TIFAC) under the Department of Science & Technology (DST) (Ministry of 
Science & Technology) is described. In addition, the role of health technology assess-
ment and TA for pollution control and prevention is described. Section 4 provides 
an example of constructive TA, whereby TA plays a role in the social shaping of 
technology. This type of TA has been used to evaluate and adopt crop varieties. 
Section 5 provides various examples of formal and informal TA activities that are 
directed towards the public domain. In Sect. 6, we draw some conclusions. But ﬁrst, 
we reﬂect on the role and relevance of TA for developing countries in general. 
2 Some Reﬂections on TA for Developing Countries 
Over the past two centuries, economies and societies have been reshaped by succes-
sive waves of technological change. Global technological change clearly has two 
faces, in particular for developing countries. On the one hand, STI is seen as a driver 
of economic and social inequalities between and within countries. On the other hand, 
STI has helped to reduce poverty in low-income countries, like China and India, but 
also including countries in Africa, as shown for example by the impact of smart-
phones. Regardless of whether more attention is paid to the opportunities or risks of 
STI, it is widely acknowledged that STI has key roles to play in achieving the MDGs 
and thus are of great importance for developing countries. It is, therefore, crucial that 
developing countries have the capacities to avoid or mitigate the risks of STI and to 
seize its opportunities, especially from the perspective of the many challenges that 
exist in the ﬁeld of poverty reduction, the need for sufﬁcient healthy food, social 
justice, and sustainability (cf. Pansera et al., 2020). According to UNCTAD (2021, 
102), foresight and TA initiatives may help “to better understand the socio-economic 
and environmental implications of new and innovative technologies,” and “to identify 
the risks and beneﬁts of technologies and the policy options for steering innovation 
so as to leave no one behind.”

2.1 
Technology Transfer and Needs Assessment 
Since there remains a large technological gap between developed and developing 
countries, one important way to interpret the importance of TA for developing coun-
tries is to place it in the context of technology transfer. Kebede and Mulder (2008, 
91) state that “The dominant mode of thinking in most developing nations is that 
one should try to obtain the sophisticated technologies from industrialized countries, 
with very often a lack of understanding for the preconditions for these technologies 
to be successfully applied.” The authors state that needs assessment and TA could 
greatly increase the chances of success of technology transfer. However according to 
Kebede and Mulder (2008, 91) “… both formal and informal TA are almost absent 
in most developing nations. … So in general, not even an informal TA takes place.” 
Given this current situation, they have developed an accessible TA framework for 
developing countries in order to link technology transfer with TA and needs assess-
ment (Table 1). This framework identiﬁes four types of relevant factors—technical, 
economic, institutional, and ecological—that should be addressed before a speciﬁc 
technology is transferred to the respective country and social practices. 
A major advantage of this framework is its simplicity and the identiﬁcation of 
practical aspects that are important for a TA in the context of technology transfer. As 
many developing countries are also major importers of technology, this framework 
can be used to perform TA in a rudimentary manner. The framework, however, pays 
little attention to legal issues (except for patents and licences), and basically ignores 
ethical issues, and issues related to access, equity and inclusion, which are crucial 
for developing countries.

2.2 
TA for Access, Equity, and Inclusion 
Recently Cozzens (2021) cautioned that STI policies tend to enhance inequality, 
unless they are particularly designed to be otherwise, and this should be analysed by 
practitioners of STI policy. She has pointed out that alternative designs are possible 
to address this. Seen in this light there can be a role for TA in assessing whether inno-
vation can be designed to be inclusive or reduce inequality caused by STI policies. 
TA combined with what is known as equity assessment may offer a solution here. For 
example, in the ﬁeld of health TA (HTA), Benkhalti et al. (2021) developed a check 
list for equity considerations. Moreover, we may be inspired by forms of inclusive 
innovation (UNESCAP, 2021), grassroots innovation (Smith et al., 2016), and frugal 
innovation (Hindocha et al., 2021) that are speciﬁcally aimed at promoting equity 
and broad access to the beneﬁts of technology, an objective often not met by the 
traditional forms of innovation. 
Finally, we want to draw attention to the access, equity, and inclusion (AEI) 
framework, which is under development at the Research and Information System for 
developing countries (RIS) in India (Chaturvedi et al., 2015). The basic idea is that 
the assessment of the societal beneﬁts of STI needs to be based on a set of broadly 
accepted public values and norms. Since from a societal perspective, access, equality 
and inclusion are particularly relevant for developing countries, the framework uses 
AEI indicators to assess the impact of STI in these areas. This is under development 
and more work is required, particularly regarding indicators. Linking this with STI 
policy has been proposed, and some of the suggestions have been identiﬁed as useful 
for developing further (Srinivas, 2020). This framework can contribute to the existing 
theorization and literature on equity, inequality, and inclusion in STI, and design of 
policies that antidote trends that result in inequitable distribution of outcomes and 
beneﬁts (c.f. Cozzens, 2021; Mirza et al., 2019; Bozeman et al., 2011). 
2.3 
Participatory TA 
Ely et al., (2011, 7) hold that conventional TA studies are often not sufﬁcient, since 
“They provide inadequate accounts of the social, technical, and ecological complexi-
ties and uncertainties at stake, and pay insufﬁcient attention to the power relations that 
often drive directions of technological change.” They claim that more participatory 
models of technology assessment that combine citizen and decision-maker partic-
ipation with technical expertise are required, which “position technologies within 
dynamic pathways of change at the system level, recognize alternative understand-
ings of these systems by different groups within society and attempt to build resilience 
in the face of pervasive uncertainty” (ibid.). As such, these participatory TA activities 
“can contribute to more democratic governance—not only of science, technology, 
and innovation, but also more widely.” (Ely et al., 2011, 10).

106
K. R. Srinivas and R. van Est
We are sympathetic to this appeal for the use of participatory methods of TA in 
developing countries. However, it is important to ask, in which political and institu-
tional situations will and can such methods actually be used? A ﬁrst crucial issue is 
whether there is a political will to engage with participatory TA. In cases, where a 
technocratic model of development is dominant there may be no support for public 
and multi-stakeholder engagement. Besides the will to use participatory TA, such 
methods also presuppose the organizational TA capacity and, maybe more impor-
tantly, the presence of organizations that can represent various stakeholders. So the 
use of participative TA methods is particularly desirable in socially controversial 
technology. But if that option is not politically feasible or practically impossible 
to realize, due to a lack of organizational TA capacity or the lack of organizations 
that can bring relevant societal perspectives, then conventional TA may be a feasible 
fall-back option. Analysing TA in theory and practice in India can give some ideas 
and insights into the adoption and adaptation of TA in developing countries. 
3 Governmental TA in India: For S&T, Health, 
and Pollution Policy 
In India, the state is the dominant player in STI, playing multiple roles including 
regulator, policymaker, promotor, and agenda-setter. The same counts for TA, a ﬁeld 
where private organizations are absent. Thus, given its prominent role, describing 
governmental TA is essential for understanding the state of TA in India and exploring 
potential future pathways. This section provides three examples of governmental 
TA. We will ﬁrst describe the S&T policy advice role played by the Technology 
Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), which is the primary 
agency for TA in India. Secondly, the emerging role of health technology assessment, 
which is strongly promoted by the government, is described. Finally, we will cover 
the application of TA for pollution control and prevention. 
3.1 
The S&T Policy Advice Role of TIFAC 
S&T ecosystem and policy 
For a long time in India, the private sector invested little in S&T, which made the state 
the prime mover, in terms of funding S&T development. The state has funded both 
basic and applied research through different ministries and research councils (see 
Box 1). In 1991, India embarked upon a series of reforms that reduced governmental 
control over technology imports and opened up the economy for greater investment 
and capital ﬂows from abroad. Technology liberalization, removal of restrictions 
on royalty payments, reduction in tariffs of capital goods imports coupled with the 
implementation of WTO Agreements, gave much scope for the private sector in

technology acquisition and transfer. Since then, the S&T ecosystem in India has 
grown and diversiﬁed. And the focus of S&T policy has shifted to incentivizing 
innovation in both public and private sectors, and leveraging start-ups and venture 
capital as new sources for innovation. Over recent years the share of the private 
sector is steadily increasing. India has emerged as a major destination for R&D 
centres set up by multi-national companies (MNCs). Bi-lateral and multi-lateral co-
operation in S&T has been expanding and is also diversifying. India is also a member 
of, or associated with, various mega-science-projects, such as CERN, the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva. 
Box 1. Key Departments/Agencies Dealing with STI (Source: Srinivas 
et al., 2018) 
• Council of Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research (CSIR) under the Ministry of 
S&T 
• Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the Ministry of S&T 
• Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) under the 
Ministry of Defense 
• Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) under the Prime Minister 
• Department of Space (DoS) under the Prime Minister 
• Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under the Ministry of S&T 
• Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Department of 
Agricultural Research 
• Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the Department of 
Health Research. 
S&T policy in India is strongly guided by the techno-positivist idea that S&T is 
a non-controversial tool for modernizing and developing the country. India is quite 
committed to centralize planning in S&T and uses ﬁve year plans for targeted devel-
opment in different sectors. So-called “Missions” are presented in speciﬁc medium-
to long-term programmes to build capacity, develop self-reliance in speciﬁc sectors, 
and harness technologies to meet national objectives. There have been many missions, 
ranging from the peaceful use of atomic energy, to exploring Mars. Since 1988, 
the activities of the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council 
(TIFAC), under the Department of S&T, have played a central role in developing 
these plans. 
S&T policy advice: TIFAC 
The Advisory Committee for Coordination of Scientiﬁc Research (ACCSR) was 
active from 1948 to 1955. Since its establishment, there have been many commit-
tees and institutional mechanisms to provide S&T policy advice. Until 2014, the 
Planning Commission which prepared the ﬁve year plans and evaluated their perfor-
mance had a division on S&T. Its successor, NITI Aayong, also has a division on 
S&T, while in 2018, the Ofﬁce of the Principal Scientiﬁc Advisor was created.

108
K. R. Srinivas and R. van Est
There are internal ministerial mechanisms in place to evaluate and assess various 
S&T programmes, study the impacts and examine the outcomes vis-a-vis the costs 
and estimated beneﬁts. External evaluations by agencies like the Comptroller and 
Auditor General of India is limited to the functioning of regulatory frameworks and 
administrative activities (e.g. CAG, 2016). 
The Technology Policy Statement of 1983 signalled a need to undertake systematic 
technology forecasting and assessment on a continuous basis and make it compulsory 
for ministries and departments involved in large investments or large volumes of 
production. Three years later, the Cabinet approved the formation of the Technology 
Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) under the Department 
of S&T. And in 1988, TIFAC was set up as an autonomous organization. Its broad 
mandate emphasizes conducting studies and giving policy advice.1 TIFAC was to 
work with stakeholders including industry, and conduct studies in forecasting and 
assessment. It has undertaken technology missions besides conducting feasibility 
studies. As an autonomous organization its mandate and operational freedom are 
broad, and there is no other institution in India that plays a role similar to TIFAC. 
The then Secretary of the Department of S&T (DST), Vasant Gowariker, hoped 
that with the creation of TIFAC and the TIFA network “… the national capabilities 
in the area of technological planning and assessment will be strengthened. This will 
contribute to the much needed inputs and advice for improved socio-economic and 
industrial planning” (Gowariker, 1988). At the time, it was envisaged that there would 
be TIFAC Groups at various ministries and industry levels. 
TIFAC’s approach 
The founding of TIFAC was based on a strong belief in technology and centralized, 
top-down expert-driven policy advice, planning, and implementation in the ﬁeld of 
S&T. As a result, TIFAC’s approach is expert-driven and technology-oriented. At the 
same time, TIFAC’s approach has been holistic, covering the entire innovation chain, 
including commercialization and upgrading, economic beneﬁts, and meeting soci-
etal needs. A ﬁve step process is employed: (1) brainstorming, (2) deﬁning the scope 
of assessment, (3) deﬁning the time horizon to be covered, (4) assessing the effects 
of technology, and (5) analysing policy options. Given its broad mandate, TIFAC 
uses forecasting and integrated that with TA. This integration was done “with prac-
tical goals in mind, namely to create alternative technology trajectories for various 
important sectors with broad acceptance from stakeholders, ranging from scientists 
to industrial and technical personnel, to business leaders and government” (Bhat-
nagar & Jancy, 2003, 24). As such, TIFAC needed to look at available technologies, 
and alternatives, and situate TA in the larger context of using S&T for national 
development. 
According to Bhatnagar and Jancy (2003), TIFAC focussed on capacity-building 
and global competitiveness, evaluated emerging technologies, and assessed tech-
nologies for promoting sustainable development. TIFAC worked across sectors 
and managed technology missions concerning the utilization of bamboo, ﬂy ash,
1 See: https://www.tifac.org.in/index.php/about-us/mandate. 

Technology Assessment in Developing Countries …
109
construction waste, and nicotine waste, and the commercial extraction of potash 
from sea water. TIFAC has been doing TA with the motto of “make technologies 
work for people” in different sectors of the economy. For this, the council assessed 
technology readiness levels, societal needs, and the socio-economic and technology 
import or development needed to provide for those needs. Given the importance 
of developing alternative technologies and substituting imported technologies with 
indigenous ones, TIFAC played a key role in technology assessment and absorption. 
In 2012, TIFAC claimed that it had completed more than 500 technology assess-
ment, demonstration and development projects, involving more than 1500 experts. 
Although TIFAC’s TA is done to assess utility and relevance for the users, it seems 
to be driven more by the institution than by users or society. There is hardly any 
reference to participatory TA or constructive TA in its work. 
Although TA was one of the key initial mandates of TIFAC, TIFAC is now more 
focussed on technology forecasting exercises. TIFAC developed a Technology Vision 
2035 and follow-ups to that and is involved in scaling up of technologies. However, 
its work on emerging technologies does not seem to have a TA dimension. With focus 
on forecasting and foresight studies, and on ideation and scaling up, TIFAC is active 
on many fronts. According to Goswami and Selvan of TIFAC, TIFAC has employed 
TA in a particular mode.2 In the Technology Vision 2035 program, technologies 
were assessed based on their technology readiness levels and to what extent they 
were able to address the needs of citizens of India.3 Similarly, for preparing their 
Technology roadmaps, TIFAC has identiﬁed many technologies after carrying out 
TA-like processes. Recently, TIFAC did a comprehensive TA exercise and identiﬁed 
technologies in 10 key sectors for the governmental climate change mitigation and 
adaptation agenda. Currently, TIFAC prepares a database of Global Technologies 
and assesses India’s needs by means of a quantitative multi-criteria decision analysis 
(MCDA). Moreover, an assessment of technologies developed in Indian R&D insti-
tutions is underway, which analyses the scale of their adoption, economic feasibility, 
and commercial potential. 
3.2 
Health Technology Assessment 
The government supports health technology assessment (HTA) in India, which is 
emerging as an important component in decision-making on medical technologies 
and treatments. In 2017, the Government of India proposed setting up a Medical 
Technology Assessment Board (MTAB).4 But later this idea was replaced with the 
health technology assessment in India network (HTAIn).5 HTAIn comprises of three

organizations, including HTAIn Secretariat, HTAIn Technical Appraisal Committee 
(TAC), and HTAIn Board. The HTAIn Secretariat collaborates with identiﬁed tech-
nical partners (TPs) and regional resource hubs (RRHs). Requests to conduct a HTA 
study can emanate from health departments in central and state governments. The 
HTA study goes far beyond cost–beneﬁt analysis and has to be rather comprehensive; 
it should also include systematic literature reviews, economic evaluations, measuring 
and valuing the health outcomes, and analyses on equity and access issues. An HTA 
also has provisions for stakeholder consultations. For example, the “HTA of intraoc-
ular lenses for treatment of age-related cataracts in India” published in 2018 addresses 
equity issues through literature survey, compares different technological options and 
makes recommendations.6 Finally, the HTA report, together with a policy brief, is 
sent to the department that requested it (Jain et al., 2018). 
3.3 
Governmental TA for Prevention, Control, 
and Abatement of Pollution 
In the National Clean Air Program (NCAP 2019), the Ministry of Environment, Forest 
and Climate Change (MoEFCC) announced that a Technology Assessment Cell will 
be established. According to NCAP (2019, 60f.) the Technology Assessment Cell is 
envisaged to: 
• evaluate signiﬁcant technologies with reference to prevention, control, and 
abatement of pollution; 
• to focus on both indigenous and international monitoring and abatement technolo-
gies, ranging from engineering and chemical to biological technologies, including 
extensive development of plantations 
• contribute towards evaluating the technology and devising the mechanism of 
technology transfer under various bilateral and multi-lateral agreements. 
This is a welcome development given the need to curb pollution and address issues 
related to climate change. The Technology Assessment Cell will use the existing 
mechanisms and programmes of the Department of Science & Technology and the 
India Innovation Hub (NCAP 2019, 61). Moreover, it will involve the Indian Institutes 
of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), major universities and 
industries. However, the involvement of other stakeholders is not mentioned, nor does 
a consultative mechanism seem to be envisaged. Thus, it seems that a technocratic 
exercise is envisioned, involving experts, academic institutions, and industry. 
From the above, it is clear that TA is growing in India, in terms of themes and 
as a relevant input for policymaking, particularly in the ﬁeld of health. Some of the 
activities on TA are linked with other objectives such as transfer of technology (ToT) 
and diffusion of technology.

4 Constructive TA: Evaluating and Adopting Technologies 
in Agriculture—ICAR 
4.1 
Extension and Technology Assessment and Reﬁnement 
In India, there are many agricultural research organizations and activities, such as 
agricultural universities, private sector entities, farmers doing research, and civil 
society-supported initiatives. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) 
is the premier research agency in agriculture in India. ICAR engages in technology 
development and assessment through research laboratories and extension centres. 
Extension is a service or system which assists farm people, through educational 
procedures, in improving farming methods and techniques, increasing production 
efﬁciency and income, bettering their standard of living and lifting social and educa-
tional standards. The agricultural extension system was developed in the 1960s and 
was expanded on account of the Green Revolution. At that time, the focus was on 
adopting technology, and not on TA. 
In 1995, ICAR institutionalized technology assessment and reﬁnement (TAR) 
as part of the extension services, through the Institute Village Linkage Programme 
(IVLP), in 42 centres linking with 42,000 families (ICAR 1995, 6). TAR is meant 
to assess technologies at the ﬁeld level and reﬁne them in such a way that they will 
ﬁt the ecological, social, and technological context of farmers. Important questions 
within the TAR, therefore, are (ICAR 1995, 10): What are the constraints in the 
farming system? Which indicators do farmers use to assess the various technologies 
for their worth, or relevance, and could there be rationality in adopting, rejecting, 
or modifying a technology? Are there differences among the indicators chosen for 
technology assessment by big, small, and marginal farmers? (ibid). The objective of 
the TAR is thus to produce and transfer technologies that are suitable, based on the 
needs and aspirations of the farmers. 
4.2 
Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) as Extension Centres 
The Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) act as extension centres and disseminate tech-
nologies. As part of their work, they do technology assessment, technology evalu-
ation, and reﬁnement. KVKs are the key component of TA in agriculture in India 
although their work goes beyond TA. For ICAR, TA is part of its mandate to help 
farmers and society through the development, dissemination, and adoption of tech-
nologies. As a public sector research institution, ICAR is funded mostly by the 
Government of India and also collaborates with stakeholders, in particular farmers, 
in TA-related activities. 
Spread across different states and climatic zones of India, there are 722 KVKs that 
play a part in the testing of crop varieties and other technologies in farmers’ ﬁelds 
(ICAR, 2020). In 2019–2020, more than ﬁve thousand technologies were assessed

112
K. R. Srinivas and R. van Est
in some thirteen thousand locations through more than twenty-ﬁve thousand trials. 
For different assessments, different criteria, like drudgery reduction, and purposes, 
like resource conservation, value addition and production of planting materials, are 
included. Regarding livestock, 1034 “technological interventions” were made in 
3338 locations, with 5156 trials related to different themes, such as disease manage-
ment, breed evaluation and production management. KVKs are involved in demon-
strating the potential of new plant varieties and technologies developed by ICAR 
(ICAR, 2020, 143). Besides analysing samples for farmers, KVKs produce seeds 
and planting materials. Thus, in ICAR, TA is integrated in many developing techno-
logical activities. This type of TA is known as constructive TA, which implies that 
ICAR is both the developer and assessor of technology. Similarly, both assessment 
and adaptation are done by ICAR, or under its aegis through the KVKs. 
ICAR also does participatory technology assessment (pTA) in a limited way. But 
the issue is complicated by the fact that TA activities are linked with adaptation, 
since “Technology assessment is one of the main activities of KVKs to identify the 
location speciﬁcity of agricultural technologies developed by the National Agricul-
tural Research System (NARS) under various farming systems.” (ICAR, 2020, 6).  
Reﬁnement, therefore, is linked with TA, and TA results in reﬁnement. For example, 
according to ICAR, demonstration in a participatory mode resulted in adoption of 
pineapple as an intercrop as it scored 86.6 in the Sustainable Livelihood Index (ibid., 
138). However, it is not clear how this Index was developed or whether the same index 
is used for different agro-climatic zones with the same methodology and data set. 
Other projects have made use of the Sustainable Livelihood Security Index, developed 
by the Department of International Development (DFID) for different agro-climatic 
zones, to assess the livelihood of cassava and rice paddy-growing farmers in Tamil 
Nadu, and used this assessment to suggest which crops and farming methods are 
preferable. 
4.3 
Gender Assessment of Technologies 
ICAR’s Central Institute for Women in Agriculture is the leading institute in gender 
assessment of technologies. ICAR links TA with gender empowerment by assessing 
how technologies could help women to reduce their drudgery and enhance liveli-
hoods. According to the Annual Report “Farm women related 280 technologies 
were assessed through 2,797 trials at 699 locations. Major themes under this cate-
gory were drudgery reduction (technologies 92, trials 880, locations 126), and health 
and nutrition (technologies 59, trials 492, locations 74).” (ICAR, 2020, 153). In this, 
ICAR evaluates the available technologies, “Drudgery experienced by women was 
assessed on a 5 point scale, with the highest score given to drudgery experience 
during marketing of ﬁsh (28.01). Two model prototypes of disc ridger—a primary  
soil tillage machine—were tested and developed based on the anthropometry and 
strength of farm women. As a part of livelihood improvement of tribal farm women 
through secondary agriculture, technological interventions in the processing of ragi,

113
mango, tomato, and cashew nut were given to tribal women of Ganjam district and a 
schematic model for establishing small scale enterprise was developed.” How exactly 
the notion of gender is integrated in TA is not clearly known. Moreover, there has 
not yet been an external or independent evaluation of ICAR’s role, and that of the 
KVKs, in TA and how successful its TA activities have been. 
In summary, ICAR has institutionalized TA in agriculture and has been sensi-
tive to women’s issues and concerns. This shows that formal systems for TA are 
widely used in India. The TA methodology is oriented towards adapting a technology 
which is developed elsewhere, to suit local conditions. Such a locally construc-
tive TA approach is valuable, but not sufﬁcient for controversial technologies, such 
as GM crops, which need a more comprehensive socio-economic impact analysis, 
which include the perceptions of all relevant stakeholders. A locally constructive 
TA should be able to weigh technological options and alternatives. ICAR’s TA is 
oriented towards adapting the technology in question. For controversial technologies, 
a different type of constructive TA is needed that pays attention to the usefulness and 
necessity discussion surrounding such technologies. 
In such cases, ﬁrstly, there is a more generic usefulness and necessity discussion 
needed, in which conﬂicting visions can play a role, and secondly, there are various 
social issues that go far beyond the local application level, such as dependence on 
large biotech companies, and the future role of organic farming in India. 
5 Formal and Informal Participatory TA in the Public 
Domain 
India has a rich history of civil society engagement with S&T. In this section, we 
discuss the case study of Bt brinjal in which the government experimented with partic-
ipatory TA. Next, we describe some examples of the engagement of civil society with 
STI. These examples could be described as informal participatory TA-like activities 
(cf. Rip, 1986). In order to contextualize these examples, it is important to ﬁrst 
outline three relevant Indian political-cultural visions of the social role of science 
and technology. 
5.1 
Three Political-Cultural Visions on the Relationship 
Between S&T and Society 
Prior to 1947, civil society initiatives were focussed on science education, commu-
nication, and popularization. Post-1947, such engagements include people’s science 
movements (PSM), movements against speciﬁc policies, projects, and institutions, 
as well as initiatives for promoting the development of alternative technologies. At

114
K. R. Srinivas and R. van Est
the risk of simpliﬁcation, the responses to S&T in India can be organized into three 
categories: Nehruvian, Gandhian, and the leftist vision of the PSM. 
The Nehruvian approach represents the dominant understanding and thinking 
based on state-led S&T, and faith in its power and potential for socio-economic 
development. S&T is also regarded as an alternative mode of thinking and practice, 
and the Nehruvian scientiﬁc temper is part of this. This understanding had an almost 
unquestionable faith in S&T, and saw only the positive aspects of S&T, ignoring the 
negative ones as exceptions, or failures of individuals and organizations, rather than 
as a quality inherent in S&T. Hence, it supported large dams, nuclear power, green 
revolution, and other technology missions. 
The Gandhian thinking inspired institutions and individuals who accepted the 
view that science without morals is a form of sin, and that S&T should be used for 
people, and decentralized production and consumption. Its rejection of the idea of 
endless growth is in a sense a harbinger of the current notion of de-growth. This 
response to S&T is concerned with an uncontrolled expansion of S&T that results 
in a concentration of wealth, growing inequities, and centralization of power and 
control. As a result, its supporters sought human-centred alternatives that focussed 
on community concerns and technology in the hands of communities. There are 
many institutions that are inspired by Gandhi and his ideas on S&T. Some of them 
are supported by the state—in particular, the Science for Equity Empowerment and 
Development (SEED) Division of DST—while others are based in institutions of 
higher learning and research. While these institutions are more focussed on devel-
oping alternatives and getting adopted, the people’s science movement has provided 
both a critique and suggestions for alternatives. 
The leftist PSM in India is critical of S&T policies. It favoured linking science 
with social revolution and alternative approaches to S&T. It took positions that were 
critical without romanticizing village life or questioning technology solely on the 
basis of size and impact. Inspired by the USSR and China in the initial years, the 
PSM later built an indigenous discourse on S&T that accepted people’s knowledge 
without romanticizing it. 
While the Nehruvian approach and the leftist PSM give importance to the modern-
izing potential of S&T and its use for societal transformation, the Gandhian approach 
emphasizes rural industrialization that meets people’s basic needs of through decen-
tralized production and consumption, and the use of small and intermediate technolo-
gies. These approaches have had their share of inﬂuence in S&T policy. In terms of 
TA, Nehruvian and leftist PSM consider formal TA as important. Moreover, the PSM 
sees public engagement and assessment as important. In the Gandhian approach, TA 
will be based on ethics, values, and the realization of societal goals, and how tech-
nology enables democratic sovereignty of the people, in particular the poor and 
vulnerable.

5.2 
Governmental Participatory TA: The Case of Bt brinjal 
A major exercise in TA involving the public at large was undertaken in the case of 
Bt brinjal. This genetically modiﬁed brinjal (also known as eggplant or aubergine) 
was created by inserting a crystal protein gene (Cry1Ac) from the soil bacterium 
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into the genome of various brinjal cultivars. For example, 
the University of Agricultural Sciences in Dharwad, in the Indian state of Karnataka, 
chose six varieties (malapur local, majari gota, udupi gulla, rabkavi local, kudchi 
local, and GO-112) for Bt transgenic conversion (Krishnaraj et al., 2009). The initial 
work was started in 2000 and it took about nine years for trials to be completed 
and evaluated. After multi-state, multi-trials, and assessments of performance of the 
outcomes, Bt brinjal was recommended for commercial cultivation in 2009 by the 
Genetic Engineering Advisory Committee (GEAC).7 
But this development was contested by many civil society organizations. The 
extensive debate on Bt brinjal brought into sharp focus the divide on the use of 
GMOs in agriculture, as well as questions on the regulation of agricultural biotech-
nology. Then, the Minister for Environment and Forest, Jairam Ramesh, called for 
a public consultation and sought comments and inputs from the wider public. The 
consultations were held in 2010, from January 13 to February 5. And on 9 February 
2010 the Government of India declared a moratorium on the release of Bt brinjal for 
commercial use and cultivation, which is still in force. The government cited lack of 
evidence of safety as the reason.8 
Another reason might have been that states like Karnataka, Uttarakhand, and 
Himachal Pradesh, had already decided to not allow cultivation of Bt brinjal, to avoid 
a confrontation in the absence of a consensus. Commenting on this controversy, Shah 
(2011, 37) pointed out that “The social and scientiﬁc appraisal of Bt brinjal, thus 
needs to be based on a methodology that can combine … scientiﬁc expertise with 
democratic participation, and such an appraisal also needs to include the issues of 
injustice in the assessment of insecurity.” 
This broad public consultation could be considered as a pTA, as it opened up for 
the ﬁrst time a broader process of public engagement with technology, instead of 
narrowing it to issues of safety as decided by scientists and expert views. But this TA 
conducted by the government was the ﬁrst and last one on agricultural technology, or 
for that matter on any technological intervention. Interestingly, while opening up the 
consultation to the public, the government did not indicate any preference, neither 
in support of nor opposition to Bt brinjal. So this exercise in TA, if we can call it so, 
reinforced the view that such forms of pTA are feasible in developing countries. 
Despite the moratorium, the research on genetic engineering applications in agri-
culture has not stopped, and the divide in opinions continues. Although there have 
been no further approvals for the commercial use or cultivation of GM, India has not 
yet taken a clear stand on not using GM technology. Moreover, there is no ofﬁcial 
policy on adoption of gene-edited crops in agriculture. Thus, while this exercise in

TA resulted in a decision, it neither opened up opportunities for such exercises in the 
future, nor brought clarity in policy. 
5.3 
Civil Society Engagement with S&T—Informal TA 
There have been many examples of technology development and evaluation centred 
on the needs of the poor, with the objective of developing and adopting pro-poor inno-
vations. Abrol (2014, 373–374), however, holds that “pro-poor innovation generation 
and diffusion in India have not been successful, because … Technology platforms, 
ecologies, and pro-poor innovation systems were not constructed with the prag-
matic aim of achieving ecological and social justice and economic empowerment of 
the poor—but as a residual socio-technical system without ensuring any systemic 
competitiveness.” 
But we can look at controversies as types of informal TA, using examples like 
the Silent Valley controversy. The Silent Valley Movement started in 1973 to save 
the Silent Valley Reserve Forest from being ﬂooded by a hydroelectric project. As 
a result, the government abandoned the power project on account of assessments 
by civil society group KSSP, whose concerns were shared by others. In terms of 
technology development and adoption, a ﬁrst example is the system of rice intensiﬁ-
cation (SRI), which is a farming methodology aimed at increasing the yield of rice. 
It is a low-water, labour-intensive method that uses younger seedlings singly spaced 
and typically hand-weeded with special tools. Although at ﬁrst the S&T establish-
ment ignored it, SRI later became widely accepted as a workable model. A second 
example is the promotion and adoption of community seed banks as an alterna-
tive approach to institutionalized S&T seed banking. Community seed banks were 
promoted by Deccan Development Society (DDS) as part of its response to techno-
logical changes in agriculture induced by the Green Revolution and the introduction 
of GMOs in agriculture, particularly Bt cotton. DDS works with women’s groups 
in about seventy-ﬁve villages in Telangana State. DDS promotes natural farming 
and organic agriculture as an alternative to GMOs. The 5,000 women members of 
DDS have developed community-based food sovereignty systems based on local 
knowledge, including grain, and seed banks. 
In all these instances, there were no formal TA activities. Instead, technologies 
ignored by the formal innovation system were adopted and popularized. Although not 
all such initiatives were successful, it is not unknown for attempts by civil society 
actors result in a certain reorientation in thinking. Thus despite the lack of state 
support, various informal TA-like activities have resulted in the development and 
adoption of technological and/or organizational alternatives through demonstrating 
their viability and feasibility.

6 Conclusion 
This chapter has provided an overview of the TA landscape in India, as an example 
of TA in a developing country. The example of India shows that despite the lack of 
a specialized TA organization or institution, TA activities are included in a broad 
spectrum of governmental STI initiatives and agencies, as well as in STI-focussed 
activities of civil society. We described ﬁve formally institutionalized governmental 
TA-like activities (Table 2) and three informal TA-like grassroots activities (Table 
3).
6.1 
Governmental TA Activities 
Since the end of the 1980s, India has set up governmental TA-like capabilities for 
technological foresight in general (via TIFAC), and for agricultural, medical and 
pollution abatement technologies in particular (Table 2). Such activities are mainly 
performed by experts and aim to strengthen India’s technological capacities in the 
above-named ﬁelds. While there is still some focus on the utilization phase of tech-
nology, in particular technology transfer, India nowadays is involved with the entire 
innovation chain; from research, development and demonstration towards market 
introduction and upscaling. Because of its tradition in the ﬁeld of technology transfer, 
India has gained a lot of experience regarding the fact that technology is only useful 
if it matches the needs and the technological, economic, environmental, and social 
context of the user. In particular, TA in the ﬁeld of agriculture (TAR) and medical 
technology (HTA) has given serious attention to issues of access, equity and inclusion. 
The various governmental TA activities show a mix of top-down expert- and 
technology-driven studies on the one hand, with attention to the needs of users and 
the social context on the other. This seems to reﬂect a mixture of the Nehruvian 
and Gandhian views on the relationships between science, technology, and society. 
Finally, the government only once employed participatory TA, as a response to the 
public controversy around the introduction of a genetically modiﬁed eggplant (Bt 
brinjal). This is despite the fact that the S&T and Innovation Policy of 2013 mentions 
public engagement, and the Economic Survey of 2018 has highlighted the need for 
public engagement in science and by scientists (DoEA 2018, 129). 
The governmental TA-like activities take into account technical, economic, insti-
tutional, and environmental factors, but none of them assess or take into account all 
four. For example, in the case of GMOs, it was questioned to what extent all relevant 
scientiﬁc factors were considered (Aga, 2022, 170–172). The TA cell and HTAIn 
are new TA-like initiatives. It would be valuable and timely to assess to what extent 
these TA-like activities meet the needs of society and to what extent the methods 
employed are adequate for assessing emerging technologies.

6.2 
Informal Societal TA Activities 
Besides governmental TA-like activities, we described three informal TA-like grass-
roots activities in India (Table 3). These activities are driven by civil society organi-
zations, which often choose one or more of the following three strategies (cf. Cramer, 
1990, 145): 
(1) educating or mobilizing the public and stimulating the public debate on STI, 
(2) putting an emphasis on inﬂuencing governmental STI policy or trying to stop 
governmental projects (as in the case of the Silent Valley movement), or 
(3) developing exemplary alternative technologies and organizations (as in the cases 
of the system of rice intensiﬁcation, and the community seed banks). 
As noted above, Rip (1986) denotes public controversies, which are related to the 
ﬁrst two strategies, as informal technology assessment. In line with that argument, 
the third strategy could be described as informal constructive TA. 
The informal TA-like grassroots activities provide a contrast to the governmental 
TA-like activities. While informality is one aspect, these grassroots activities often 
represent and give voice to marginalized stakeholders, and in some cases provide 
an alternative option in terms of technology and organization. The system of rice 
intensiﬁcation (SRI) is now recognized by the formal agricultural research and 
extension system of the state. The Silent Valley Movement questioned the logic 
of generating electricity at any cost. Community seed banks are part of informal 
seed and germplasm conservation and various development initiatives. But there are 
not many such informal TA-like initiatives in India. Moreover, there is often a weak 
linkage between informal TA-like activities and the formal innovation ecosystems 
of universities or institutions of higher learning. 
6.3 
Lessons from India for Developing Countries 
So India does have both formal and informal TA, which according to Kebede and 
Mulder (2008) are almost absent in most developing nations. In terms of TA, there-
fore, India cannot be seen as a typical developing country. We should note, however, 
that Kebebe and Mulder made their observation in 2008 and a lot may have changed 
since then. This certainly applies for India, which has expanded its TA capacity, 
especially in the ﬁeld of HTA and pollution TA. Moreover, the Indian government 
organized a participatory TA event on the introduction of Bt brinjal in 2010. 
In Sect. 2, we identiﬁed three important TA topics for developing countries: tech-
nology transfer and needs assessment, TA for access, equity and inclusion, and partic-
ipatory TA, including the role civil society or informal TA can play. The developments 
in the ﬁeld of TA in India indeed show the importance of these three TA topics. Below, 
we brieﬂy review these three topics and identify a set of parameters that are important 
for the deployment of TA in developing countries.

Technology Assessment in Developing Countries …
121
Historically, TA was ﬁrst given a place at the end of the 1980s in the ﬁeld of 
technology transfer, and in particular in determining which technical areas India 
needed, related to societal needs and challenges (see Sect. 3.1 on TIFAC). It is 
interesting to note that this desire to put state-led innovation policy more at the service 
of societal challenges is a relatively modern turn of events in the European Union (cf. 
Mazzucato, 2015, 2018). It also shows that for such state-led socio-technical mission 
oriented innovation, TA is a natural partner. The following parameters, therefore, play 
a crucial role in determining the desired role of TA for developing countries: 
(1) government-driven or market-driven innovation; 
(2) phase of the innovation chain: beginning, middle or end; 
(3) type of grand societal challenges; and 
(4) institutional capacity in STI, including TA. 
Access, equity and inclusion are important social issues within TA that are espe-
cially relevant for developing countries. In India, within governmental TA activities, 
we see attention to these issues, in particular in the ﬁelds of agricultural TA and HTA. 
Of course, the three described informal TA-like grassroots activities are strongly 
driven by the above three public values. 
Finally, governmental TA in India is characterized in particular as expert-driven 
and technocratic, and by a lack of approaches that seek the participation of societal 
interest groups or citizens. This is despite the fact that the following aspects form a 
good breeding ground for organizing participatory TA activities: 
(1) the existing attention within government institutions in the ﬁeld of STI towards 
societal needs and issues such as access, equity, and inclusion are in principle a 
good breeding ground for participatory TA; 
(2) the identiﬁed need for public engagement in science in various policy docu-
ments; 
(3) the critical self-reﬂective Indian political culture with regard to the relationship 
between STI and society—especially the Gandhian and the leftist vision of the 
PSM; and 
(4) the presence of an active public debate on the societal role of STI, as evidenced by 
the three described controversies surrounding technology and related informal 
grassroots TA activities. 
Finally, institutional capacity in the ﬁeld of participatory TA is an important 
precondition for the implementation of participatory TA. It could have signiﬁcant 
impact on STI if India, and other developing countries, would choose and be able to 
develop such a capacity in the coming years.

Climate Change—Does the IPCC Model 
Provide the Foundation for a Potential 
Global Technology Assessment 
Framework? 
Peta Ashworth 
and Elliot Clarke 
1 Introduction 
Climate change has been identiﬁed as the “perfect moral storm”—global in nature 
with long-lasting intergenerational impacts (Gardiner, 2011) with a lack of the polit-
ical will necessary to address the issues. The anticipated damage that ecosystems and 
society will bear because of adverse climatic events will place a signiﬁcant burden 
on people, societies, the environment and the global economy unless greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions are signiﬁcantly reduced. While there is now, a dedicated move 
towards net-zero emissions through stated aspirations of various industries and the 
laws of some governments, there is still a need for a pressing upheaval of existing 
systems, if the world is to remain well below the 2°C target of the Paris Agree-
ment (UNFCCC, 2015) or the 1.5°C target outlined in the Special Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2018a). 
Beyond the hard science, climate change has become much more than just an 
aggregation of scientiﬁc data from the natural sciences. As Hulme (2010a, 267) states, 
the adverse impacts of a changing climate include “political, social and psychological 
functions”, requiring important consideration of cultural interplays, value systems 
and regional differences that exist between the global north and south, and developed 
and developing countries.

Integral to the global response to climate change are two international bodies. 
The ﬁrst, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was established 
by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environ-
ment Programme (UNEP) in 1988. The IPCC serves as the core scientiﬁc advisory 
body delivering evidence-based climate policy recommendations from global scien-
tiﬁc data into international climate negotiations convened by the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC comprises 
197 countries and entered into force in March 1994 with the aim of preventing 
“dangerous human interference with the climate system” (UNFCCC, 2015). Under-
standing the potential societal impacts of mitigation technologies and supporting 
science that unpacks the use of resources and practises across sectors is a key func-
tion of the advice from the IPCC. Such a process of providing independent scientiﬁc 
advice is also at the heart of technology assessment (TA). 
Here, we examine the structure, practises and methods of the IPCC as a legitimate 
scientiﬁc institution and its interplay with the global political decision-making forum 
of the UNFCCC and compare it with TA theory and practice. The principal aim is to 
investigate if such an institutionalised process of co-design, between governments 
and the researchers who gather scientiﬁc evidence for policymakers, could serve as 
a potential global TA model that can be applied to other global challenges. Through 
examining successes, shortfalls and some criticisms of the IPCC process, we identify 
how these challenges may be mitigated. We use TA analytical and impact frameworks 
(Belluci et al., 2002; Hennen et al., 2004) to investigate whether an image of legit-
imacy can be realised from a global governance perspective, and whether this can 
also help to build trust in science advice at the country and community level (Sanz-
Menéndez, & Cruz-Castro, 2019). In short, this chapter applies a critical lens to 
the IPCC as one potential global TA model, arguing for the inclusion of grass-
roots participatory TA alongside traditional governance and reporting frameworks 
to deliver holistic solutions to climate change outcomes, and ideally other global 
challenges. 
2 Technology Assessment 
There is a long history that outlines how TA aims to support policymakers, and ulti-
mately society, when making decisions surrounding the value of existing or emerging 
technologies and the potential risks and challenges they may present (Michalek et al., 
2014). Historically, it originated as a science-led policy consultation device within 
economically developed institutions (Scherz et al., 2019). Framed as neutral decision-
making advisories, immune from ideological or political interference, the use and 
prevalence of TA frameworks has varied across societal, geographical and temporal 
scales. This has resulted in a range of TA methods being developed over decades as 
a way of ﬁnding solutions to controversies and associated risks with the introduc-
tion of new scientiﬁc breakthroughs and technological innovations (Cruz-Castro & 
Sanz-Menedez, 2005).

Climate Change—Does the IPCC Model Provide …
129
At its core, TA provides the knowledge and processes to help society cope with 
innovation and mitigate potential social and environmental risks in future. The focus 
on societal outcomes has mutually implicated a strong reliance on political elements 
and inﬂuences (Ladikas & Hahn, 2019; Van Est & Brom, 2012). In so doing, TA as 
a source of advice, “must compete—and try to co-exist—with many other sources 
of information that politicians, governments, bureaucrats or parliaments use” (Cruz-
Castro & Sanz-Menedez, 2004, 106). Competing sources of data for global prob-
lems like climate change are complex and require a global TA response at the 
corresponding scale. However, what often happens is that the experts that consti-
tute TA advisories and policymakers as target audiences, often disagree about what 
path to take (Ladikas, 2019). This may result in a standoff, total inaction, or inef-
fective untested solutions being implemented-often decided in efforts to win votes 
and remain in power rather than being truly solutions oriented as recommended by 
the science. Evidenced in the climate change domain, this can have dire and often 
irreversible consequences. 
The call for TA to be applied as a global model stems from the ever increasing 
need to address real-world problems through international cooperation and dialogue 
(Ladikas & Hahn, 2019). While some technological solutions have resulted in posi-
tive impacts, it is also evident that there can be unintended consequences across 
geographic regions of the world (Scherz et al., 2019). This is further inﬂuenced by 
the type of political system in which the technology is being deployed (i.e. liberal 
versus autocratic) and the country’s level of economic development,1 as this limits 
or enables capacity to respond. Van Est and Brom (2012) also refer to the importance 
of normative frames and an openness to consider and include alternative views as 
part of TA responses. Despite leading TA scholars acknowledging the need to bring 
together diverse cultural and societal nuances into a global framework (Ladikas & 
Hahn, 2019), there remains limited consensus on what a TA model at the global scale 
should look like, and how, or who by, it should be implemented. 
While global TA has merit for dealing with complex challenges, there is also 
some discussion about its inability to accommodate different levels of scale. For 
example, some concerns remain surrounding how the deployment of TA solutions 
transpire locally. Currently, TA remains a high-income state-driven pursuit in more 
economically developed regions of the world (Ladikas, 2019). While there is a clear 
need for a global TA framework that transcends socio-economic and neo-liberal 
considerations, there is also recognition that local problems will require solutions 
that exist beyond a global TA framework to “consider contextual circumstances and 
aid decision-making in different settings” (Ladikas, 2019). The EUROPTA analytical 
framework (Bellucci et al., 2002), with a focus on participatory TA, provides a 
starting point for identifying necessary elements of what may constitute a global 
TA framework. It does this through recognising the interplay between society and 
institutional contexts and how participatory systems are organised. The solutions,

broad categories: developed economies, economies in transition and developing economies.

outputs and corresponding advice generated from TA can be understood in terms of 
impact. 
The connotations applied to “impact” within TA are often described as subjective. 
For decades, TA scholars have strived to balance the need to reﬂect normative endeav-
ours without rigid expectations in the form of hard policy as its impact. Hennen et al. 
(2004) describe impact in the form of a three-dimensional typology aimed at policy-
makers that includes: (1) raising knowledge and/or awareness, (2) forming opinions 
and attitudes and (3) initialising action. 
Raising knowledge can be viewed as an increase in the visibility of technical 
knowledge, or a broad overview of potential societal outcomes as a consequence 
of a new technological development (Hennen et al., 2004). This is because it is 
important to understand the social impacts of advances in technology, rather than 
solely an assessment of implications through scientiﬁc data. This can be further 
extended to an exploration of existing policies and objectives (Hennen et al., 2004). 
Second, forming attitudes and opinions helps in agenda-setting through inﬂuencing 
public discourse or stimulating public debate. This is invaluable when the public 
and other stakeholders are exposed to new technology and ideas with a relatively 
high level of uncertainty. These can be further explored through participatory TA 
activities such as scenario constructions or deliberative processes, which both present 
imagined futures of the technology as well as meeting expectations of procedural 
fairness through democratic deliberation (Hennen et al., 2004). The third dimension 
to the proposed impact typology references initialisation of action that may result in 
policy development, delivery and decision-making. There are also pathways towards 
introducing new models of governance, process implementation and other tangible 
initiatives (Hennen et al., 2004). 
These understandings of impact aim to include varying outputs and lend them-
selves to a wider deﬁnition of impact: “Impact of TA is deﬁned as any change with 
regard to the state of knowledge, opinions held, and actions taken by relevant actors 
in the process of societal debate on technological issues” (Hennen et al., 2004, 61). 
This is also true when considering climate change. 
Across the world, the public are increasingly exposed to the potential social and 
ecological impacts of climate change, with those countries least able to respond to 
climate change being the ones most vulnerable to its impacts (UNFCCC, 2020). 
To overcome this, there are a range of mitigation and adaptation solutions being 
generated, particularly, as the urgent need to mitigate GHG emissions becomes even 
more apparent (IPCC, 2021a). Some of these are challenging the status quo, or tradi-
tional ways of working, as well as associated cultural rituals. Given the complex 
and global nature of the climate crisis, a global TA response has been positioned 
as a necessary framework to address the corresponding risks. The IPCC offers a 
substantive global TA model that not only provides scientiﬁc advice to policymakers 
but may also be applied to other grand challenges. Understanding the inﬂuence 
of the IPCC and climate change on real-world outcomes requires further investi-
gation of the constructed and deﬁnitional nature of ‘impact’ as a consequence of 
distributed climate assessments. The impact of IPCC advice through Hennen et al.’s 
(2004) typology holds true for how advice is received and inserted into public debate,

131
particularly when attempting to measure its inﬂuence on policy. Reﬂecting on the 
current state of play for climate change mitigation suggests the IPCC framework, 
while not perfect, provides one potential model for an effective global TA framework, 
as detailed below. 
3 The IPCC Model: Potential as a Global TA Framework 
3.1 
History of the IPCC 
Established by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the UN Envi-
ronment Program (UNEP), the IPCC was endorsed by the UN General Assembly on 
6 December 1988. Its initial task, as outlined in UN General Assembly Resolution 
43/53, was to review and prepare climate change science and outline the ecological, 
social and economic costs of environmental degradation (IPCC, 2021b). The IPCC 
brings together scientists from approximately 80 countries across the world. Crit-
ical to its relevance to governments is its recognition as a government institution, 
as demonstrated in its name; “Intergovernmental”. The IPCC releases an update on 
the latest science every 5–7 years. The ﬁrst assessment report (FAR) was released in 
1990, which “underlined the importance of climate change as a challenge with global 
consequences and requiring international cooperation” (IPCC, 2021b). The second 
reporting cycle was released in 1996, and directly guided decision-makers prior to 
the ﬁnalisation of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. These were subsequently followed 
by a third report (2001) aimed at addressing adaptation, and a fourth report (2007) 
that laid the foundations for a post-Kyoto world. The ﬁfth report, issued in 2013, 
directly advised what would become the Paris Climate Agreement on December 
12, 2015. Currently, in its sixth assessment period, the IPCC has recently produced 
“AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis” from Working Group 
1 (IPCC, 2021a), along with technical papers, methodology reports and special 
summary reports (IPCC, 2021b). 
Throughout these periods of assessment, releases and reporting cycles, the IPCC 
asserts that their advice has accelerated peer-reviewed literature on climate science, 
increased public awareness, and fostered collaboration and participation between 
different actors to achieve the targets set by the global community. In its view, 
this consistently leads to international climate change decision-making and policy 
reforms (IPCC, 2021b). Notably, in 2007, IPCC authors, in conjunction with Al Gore, 
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for their efforts to build up and disseminate 
greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for 
the measures that are needed to counteract such change”. There is possibly no higher 
recognition of their contribution and policy impact on the world.

3.2 
IPCC Structure 
The IPCC has a sophisticated structure which is integral to its success and oper-
ations. It comprises three core working groups: Physical science basis, impacts, 
adaptation and vulnerability and mitigation of climate change; and a Task Force 
Bureau that oversees the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme (IPCC, 
2021c). The nature of these working groups in many ways resembles what has been 
described as expert TA, where experts come together to gather scientiﬁc informa-
tion in relation to an identiﬁed problem (Van Est & Brom, 2012). Using Hennen 
et al.’s (2004) typology, much of this early work would ﬁt under the ﬁrst stream of 
raising knowledge and awareness of the issues at hand. Each working group consists 
of lead authors, review editors, and chapter scientists who are tasked with collating 
and presenting relevant research. As experts in their own ﬁelds, IPCC authors have 
been approached by member governments to participate and, if accepted, volunteer 
their time to do so (IPCC,  2021c). There is also a large external cohort of government 
representatives and researchers who operate as expert reviewers, based on their ﬁelds 
of expertise. All of this is underpinned by a secretariat which coordinates the wider 
IPCC organisational, administrative, and planning matters. 
The IPCC 195 member governments, along with representatives from observer 
organisations, convene at least once a year (more during assessment cycles), in the 
form of Plenary Sessions. This government mechanism is known as “the Panel” and 
is critical to the overall functioning and success of the IPCC. “The Panel works by 
consensus to decide on the organisation’s budget and work programme; the scope 
and outline of its reports; issues related to principles and procedures of the IPCC; and 
the structure and mandate of IPCC Working Groups and Task Forces. The Panel also 
approves and adopts IPCC reports and elects the IPCC Chair, other members of the 
IPCC Bureau and the Task Force Bureau.” (IPCC, 2021c, 1). Whether the structure 
and mandate of the Panel can be replicated will be an important consideration for a 
global TA model. 
3.3 
Processes 
The IPCC processes, and any subsequent reviews, are advised by a set of 10 
sub-principles (IPCC, 2018b). These include reaching consensus amongst working 
groups for decisions relating to procedures; deciding when IPCC ﬁndings are made 
ofﬁcial; matters relating to time-frames for participating actors; issues surrounding 
how reports are made available, by when, and in what languages; process scheduling; 
ﬁnancial procedures; and how elections are conducted (IPCC, 2018b). The resulting 
processes can be understood in terms of (a) reporting, (b) writing and reviewing, (c) 
error protocol, (d) conﬂicts of interest, (e) funding, (f) communication, (g) gender 
and (h) observer organisations.

Climate Change—Does the IPCC Model Provide …
133
Firstly, IPCC publications consist of three sub-channels to deliver climate advice. 
IPCC Reports include “Assessments, Synthesis and Special Reports, their Summaries 
for Policymakers, and Methodology Reports” (IPCC, 2021d). These are supported by 
technical papers and other materials inclusive of workshop proceedings and databases 
to assist other generational processes. Second, writing and review processes are 
subject to Review Editors that include the “consideration of the range of scientiﬁc, 
technical and socio-economic views” (IPCC, 2021d). Third, error protocols were 
introduced whereby concerns surrounding reporting can be investigated. Fourth, a 
conﬂict-of-interest component of the procedural process is designed to protect the 
legitimacy and integrity of the IPCC’s reporting and associated activities: “individ-
uals must disclose circumstances that could lead a reasonable person to question 
an individual’s objectivity, or whether an unfair advantage has been created, consti-
tute a potential conﬂict of interest.” (IPCC, 2021d). Fifth, IPCC funding is sourced 
from member organisations and parent bodies, the WMO and the UNEP. Further 
support is provided as in-kind contributions from governments providing experts to 
produce the advice generated by unpaid member-sponsored experts (IPCC, 2021d). 
Finally, communication constitutes who the audience is, that is, which policymakers 
are viewed as important in the global climate discussion and which are not. This can 
be problematic throughout the internalised decision-making process when selecting 
authors and editors (IPCC, 2021d). 
3.4 
Technologies 
Relevant to any TA discussion about the IPCC are the technologies being assessed. 
Within the IPCC there is a focus on both mitigation and adaptation, which means there 
are a range of technologies being examined. With mitigation, the IPCC reports synthe-
sise the latest peer-reviewed information on each of the technologies and the scenarios 
which model their potential deployment, to make an assessment on their potential 
for effective GHG mitigation. Most of the work to assess these technologies, i.e. the 
early TA component, is undertaken by other reputable external bodies, including the 
International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) and various other regional or country-speciﬁc researchers and research 
groups. This TA work tends to be funded by the different bodies who are subse-
quently referenced within the reports. However, at times the UNFCCC will issue 
calls for speciﬁc technological reviews to inform their work. The range of technolo-
gies for mitigation includes renewable energies such as solar, wind, biomass, biofuels, 
nuclear energy, energy storage, hydrogen and other more contentious technologies 
such as carbon dioxide capture, utilisation and storage. 
Work is also undertaken speciﬁcally around technologies for developing coun-
tries, through the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll), for example. 
These programmes tend to focus on technologies for improving energy access and 
reducing harmful effects of more polluting and inefﬁcient technologies (e.g. biomass 
cookstoves and kerosene lamps), prevalent in many developing countries. Coupled

134
P. Ashworth and E. Clarke
with this work, is the identiﬁcation of necessary government support and trialling the 
effectiveness of various ﬁnancial mechanisms to achieve greater technology deploy-
ment. Most of the SEforAll work is funded from philanthropic organisations and 
large aid initiatives such as UK Aid and USAid Power Africa. 
For adaptation, the technologies can include anything from new land management 
practises, livestock systems and management of their ruminants, agroforestry, irriga-
tion efﬁciencies, waste management and more novel technologies such as molecular 
biology, genome modiﬁcation, new marine and freshwater ﬂora and fauna and so 
on (de Coninck et al., 2018). The speciﬁc types of TA activities vary, depending on 
the level of technological development, where the TA activity is being undertaken, 
and what the assessment need might be. All of this information feeds into speciﬁc 
country targets. 
4 Climate Change State of Play 
Following the Paris Agreement, all countries were obligated to set national targets 
known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline the ways in 
which they will reduce their GHG emissions. NDCs have been “at the heart of the 
Paris Agreement” (UNFCCC, 2021), and represent the initialising action stage of the 
typology of impacts discussed earlier (Hennen et al., 2004). It is the responsibility of 
each member country to set targets to reduce emissions at the nation state level and 
report these through the UNFCCC every ﬁve years. Other critical elements relate 
to adaptation, ﬁnance, transparency and accountability mechanisms for emissions 
trading. 
Despite all these processes, the world continues to do poorly in delivering the goals 
and targets required by the Paris Agreement. Today, the world is 1.1°C warmer when 
compared to pre-industrial levels, and on a decadal average in 2020, was 1.24°C above 
pre-industrial level (IPCC, 2021a). This clearly requires an immediate coordinated 
global response, as often highlighted by the UNFCCC and other concerned scientists 
(UNFCCC, 2020; Union of Concerned Scientists, 2020). More recent climate data 
also underscores the urgency for mitigating climate change and to stay within the 
Paris Agreement targets of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, or at most 2°C, and 
achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 (UNFCCC, 2021). The International Climate 
Energy Related Developments Review (UNEP, 2020) and others have determined 
that emissions have continued to rise since the Paris Agreement and are mostly 
attributed to the burning of fossil fuels (Le Quéré et al., 2021). 
While there is some optimism that certain countries are projected to make posi-
tive inroads towards decreasing their emissions, there is consensus that no country 
is doing enough to keep temperatures well below the required 2°C increase (IPCC, 
2018a). Even with the countries who committed to the Paris Agreement fully imple-
menting their NDCs, the world is falling well short of meeting the required GHG 
emissions reduction (Roelfsema, et al., 2020). This of course is leading to substan-
tial consequences for the environment and the global community (IPCC, 2021a). In

135
particular, the most vulnerable and marginalised people, who are least likely to be 
able to withstand the potential impacts of climate change, are unfortunately often 
the ones who are most exposed (UNFCCC, 2020; Rigoud et al., 2018). This places a 
burden on more developed countries to ﬁnd solutions which, often, are technological 
in nature. 
Accelerating the support, advice and access to information provided to vulner-
able regions from wealthier states, which are tasked with fostering resilience across 
varying societal scales, is critical to mitigate climate change impacts. Such conclu-
sions have real-world implications for ecosystems and livelihoods when determining 
vulnerability and accountability. For example, while China remains the world’s 
leading emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing 28% of global emis-
sions, its contribution per capita remains relatively low, particularly when compared 
to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nation 
states (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2020). This brings into question the respon-
sibilities of more developed regions when measuring per capita carbon emissions, 
and how best to ensure the necessary climate change action, by whom and at what 
level (World Bank, 2016; World Bank et al., 2016). 
In Europe, the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network 
has undertaken a number of TA-focused activities in relation to climate change. 
Its 2015 report was designed to provide politicians with climate change informa-
tion containing “…new and rigorous insight on these challenging and far-reaching 
questions, generally not presented by medias in proper ways for political decisions” 
(EPTA, 2015, p.8). More recent activities have included the Norwegian Board of 
Technology’s focus on Norway’s emerging capacity to produce green hydrogen 
through the availability of cheaper sources of renewables (NBT, 2021). Germany 
continues to focus on energy efﬁciency in building construction to discern adequate 
cost–beneﬁt results (TAB, 2021). And, Greece has been working on tools for inves-
tigating the effects of natural disasters arising from climate change (GPCRT, 2019). 
Despite activities such as these, progress on mitigation remains low. 
5 Reﬂections on the IPCC Model: Successful or Not? 
Given the slow progress towards mitigating climate change impacts, there is an oppor-
tunity to unpack the interplay between the IPCC and the global political decision-
making processes and the policy implementation of the UNFCCC and nation states. 
Acknowledging both the IPCC’s successes and shortcomings provides an opportunity 
to understand whether the structure of the IPPC model could be more successfully 
developed into one possible global TA framework to be applied across multiple grand 
challenges. It evokes the question whether building such a model of trust and legit-
imacy through global science can better serve advisory outcomes for international 
policymakers, and ultimately broader society, around contentious issues. 
Indeed, it has been a global success that an assessment of scientiﬁc data and tech-
nology to combat climate change was cooperatively established in the form of the

136
P. Ashworth and E. Clarke
IPCC. Certainly, there have been more nuanced successes when measured against 
the impact typology outlined by Hennen et al. (2004). The ﬁrst, raising knowl-
edge, can be evidenced through the visibility of technical knowledge via the reports 
that are created and distributed to policymakers and made accessible to the public. 
Second, these reports are regularly inserted into public debates surrounding action on 
climate change by various actors, including NGOs, community groups, journalists, 
industry and policymakers. Third, states have initialised action by making commit-
ments towards net-zero emissions as a consequence of IPCC reporting. These have 
manifested into policies that subsidise renewable energy projects at both a household 
and commercial scale, along with other mitigation and adaptation policies. However, 
are these successes enough? While these accomplishments can be understood and 
mapped to Hennen et al.’s (2004) impact typology, most countries which are signato-
ries to the Paris Agreement will miss their reduction targets. There remains a serious 
discord between softer impacts and initialising collaborative real-world policies to 
mitigate climate change, although this does fall outside the mandate of the IPCC. 
Although many are supportive of the IPCC/UNFCCC process, there remain some 
areas of contestation surrounding it. These include: lack of impact in achieving global 
emissions targets, mainly due to a lack of political will; the degree of autonomy the 
IPCC has when conducting a reporting cycle and communicating its ﬁndings; whether 
seeking consensus results in obscuring or making invisible the crucial differences 
between diverse global communities; the minor historical errors in reporting advice 
which diminished perceptions of the integrity of the advice at the time; and ﬁnally, 
whether the IPCC publications, at times, have been too technical, thus compromising 
their ability to be accessible to policymakers and other actors. These critiques aimed 
at the top-down model of the IPCC are expanded upon below. 
5.1 
A Requirement for Increasing Impact Through Initiating 
Action 
The IPCC process was established to inform policy without being policy prescriptive, 
which is what allows it to gain support within government processes. However, a 
vacuum in mandatory oversight combined with the observed inability to initialise 
action at the global level, appears to be a major obstacle in generating and maintaining 
trust in the effectiveness of the IPCC process. Questionable and misleading claims 
of enforceability through the UNFCCC have also complicated the translation of the 
IPCC advice into real-world policy actions. Whereas in other issue areas such as 
the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (UNEP, 2020), 
marine dumping laws through the 1996 London Protocol which entered into force 
in 2006 (IMO, 2006), and the General Data Protection Regulation in the European 
Union (European Commission, 2016), international compliance remains high. It 
appears that the complex nature of climate change poses a signiﬁcant barrier to

Climate Change—Does the IPCC Model Provide …
137
international cooperation in meeting targets to mitigate GHG emissions, particularly 
if governments choose not to respond to the IPCC’s advice. 
An example of this is the problematic nature of the Kyoto period climate targets. 
The targets were thought to impact economic competitiveness, be too complicated 
to ensure compliance, and ultimately difﬁcult to monitor and enforce (Victor, 2011). 
Without binding commitments through the decision-making arm, the UNFCCC, 
or some other governance mechanism, this raises an important question of legiti-
macy, and whether public conﬁdence in such processes can be maintained, and more 
importantly if they will ever be effective. 
The complications come in two forms. The ﬁrst, the ﬂexible set of country-based 
actions determined by each individual state (NDCs), makes serious targets difﬁcult 
to enforce; and second, a lack of binding penalties (Denchak, 2021) further compli-
cates mechanisms to penalise or encourage non-conforming states which are party 
to the Paris Agreement. While there have been instances of the UNFCCC enforce-
ment branch issuing notices of Paris Agreement compliance breaches for reporting 
failures (UNFCCC, 2020), the examples do not recommend any action other than 
submissions or reviewing internalised reporting protocols. It has been suggested that 
implementing such a mechanism would likely undo the ability of governments and 
scientists to reach agreement in the ﬁrst place. 
While enforceability, and lack thereof, at the global level through the UNFCCC 
is outside the remit of the advisory role of the IPCC, the failure to meet current 
global mitigation targets suggests the need for additional measures alongside the 
scientiﬁc advice and recommendations of the IPCC process. This corresponds with 
the initialising action stage of Hennen et al.’s impact framework, which implies there 
may be a role for regulators which are not involved in steering the science to play 
a role in mitigating poor outcomes (Van Est & Brom, 2012). Alternatively, another 
peak body could be established for this purpose, but either way, it is a question that 
will need consideration when trialling any global TA model in future. 
5.2 
Consensus and Situated Knowledge 
The scientiﬁc community has conferred support for the overarching consensus on 
climate change knowledge claims, including the advice and modelling by the IPCC. 
Agreement can also be found outside the domain of science within government 
institutions. For example, US, UK and other European ofﬁcials are charged with 
providing direct advice to politicians and committees. The IPCC has found allies in 
civic society, activists, and NGO groups aligned with environmental matters (Ray, 
2011). However, the push for consensus through the UN process has been accused 
of simultaneously “making invisible” localised challenges and individual struggles 
at the community scale. How climate knowledge is created or discarded, respected 
or shunned, or determined to be of value within the scope of the IPCC reporting 
cycle may exclude some knowledge into the periphery. However, given the nature of

138
P. Ashworth and E. Clarke
the synthesis, which combines the work of over 50,000 research outputs, this is not 
unexpected. 
Researchers are not arguing against the need for a global model to approach 
TA and climate change, rather Kunelius et al. (2016) and Hulme (2010a, 2010b) 
are mindful of presenting knowledge as a universal truth determined by consensual 
processes that ignore key concepts such as identity, sense of place and time (Hulme, 
2010a, 2010b). “Rather than seeking a consensual global knowledge which erases 
difference and allows the most powerful to determine what is “known”, we need to 
pay greater attention to the different ways knowledge comes to be made in different 
places and how different kinds of knowledge gain hold in people’s minds, traction in 
different cultures and assent in global fora. This is spectral knowledge which emerges 
from a cosmopolitan perspective.” (Hulme, 2010a, 2010b, 563). 
Potentially “washing over” situated knowledge of climate change in the quest 
for consensus may curb nuanced understandings. This is especially true for indige-
nous knowledge and other cultural representations that are often neglected in the 
IPCC reporting in favour of positivist Western ways of knowing and understanding 
a changing climate (Corbera et al., 2016; Ford et al., 2016). Ford et al., (2016, 351) 
argue the importance of prioritising indigenous knowledge in the next round of IPCC 
reporting. This highlights an important challenge confronting the IPCC that has not 
been solved. How does the IPCC maintain a global purview while acknowledging 
the diverse cultural and situated experiences and knowledge at the community scale? 
This is particularly so if not all indigenous knowledge has been published in the more 
traditional literature formats, which is also a requirement of the scientiﬁc approach to 
knowledge. Ladikas and Hahn (2019, 10) acknowledge this challenge as important 
to any global TA framework that may be developed. 
5.3 
Public Trust in Reporting: Integrity, Errors, and the Need 
for Transparency 
Similar to the discussions on TA, the IPCC is not always considered a neutral knowl-
edge base. Authors, editors, reviewers and the UNFCCC which responds to the advice 
of the IPCC are all compromised by their own norms and values that determine what 
knowledge is valuable and what is not (Corbera et al., 2016; Ford et al., 2016). 
While Ford et al., (2016, 349) acknowledge the importance of the IPCC in delivering 
climate advice, they also argue that applying a critical lens to IPCC reporting reveals 
inequalities hidden by a speciﬁc technocratic approach to knowledge and consensus: 
“… it has also been noted that the procedural rules governing how the IPCC oper-
ates and the positionality of the author teams (for example, disciplinary background) 
has resulted in the privileging of positivist science and technocratic perspectives, the 
marginalisation of other ways of knowing (for example, local, traditional and indige-
nous knowledge) and the prioritisation of scenarios and modelling approaches” Ford 
et al., (2016, 349).

Arpino and Obydenkova (2020) concede there has been a decline in trust in 
the United Nations and its associated bodies since the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. This 
coincides with ongoing miscommunication problems that destabilise or erode trust 
between the scientiﬁc community and the general public (Rabinovich et al., 2012). 
These concerns are exacerbated by the ever-increasing complexity of the inter-related 
nature of climate change and the evolving consequences that need to be absorbed by 
the public in order to take effective action (Rabinovich et al., 2012). 
The IPCC as an international organisation is no different to others of equivalent 
standing, and has been subject to various criticisms. For example, it has been chal-
lenged about the lack of transparency in assessment models and questionable funding 
agendas within the research community (Robertson, 2020); the “Climategate” issues 
associated with the email hacking of the Climate Research Unit at the University of 
East Anglia in 2009 which impacted overall trust in the process (Nature, 2010); and 
issues challenging the ambiguity of its assertions in relation to Himalayan glaciers 
and Amazon rainforests which were later clariﬁed (Ray, 2011). Clearly, issues of 
transparency need to be proactively addressed and considered for any global TA 
model. 
5.4 
Accessibility: Understanding and Scale 
Harold et al. (2020) suggest that some of the IPCC information and data is, at times, 
considered too technical for policymakers, and therefore requires improved presenta-
tion to make the information more accessible. Criticisms have focused on the infor-
mation being difﬁcult to understand and inaccessible to non-specialist audiences, 
especially policymakers, primarily based on poor readability of the text (Barkemeyer 
et al., 2016; Budescu et al., 2014; Mach et al., 2016) and the structure of documents 
(Stocker & Plattner, 2016). 
This challenge can be further extrapolated to the overall process of national 
country actors identifying their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). While 
the NDCs may be developed with the best intentions, they too can become inacces-
sible to those at the state and local government level, not to mention local communi-
ties. This has been attributed to both a lack of clarity surrounding the information, and 
also the required mechanisms for implementation. This suggests that while there is a 
need for a global TA model, attention must also be given to making the information 
accessible across different scales, rather than leave it solely to national governments. 
Since the 1990s, there has been a long history of change in TA practises from 
more expert-centred advice to more participatory practises (Joss & Belluci, 2002), 
implementing methods such as consensus conferences, citizens summits, and future 
panels, for example. In climate change, citizens’ panels provide a model that enables 
local communities to engage with the science and technological innovations in an 
evidence-based way. Implementing local deliberative panels could easily work in 
unison with the global and national level TA models outlined above to ensure trans-
lation at the local level. Key authors in the ﬁeld have long argued for new and

140
P. Ashworth and E. Clarke
innovative ways to include citizens in decision-making. They assert the need for new 
pathways and innovative TA models that create cooperatives of experts, citizens, 
and policymakers (Ladikas & Hahn, 2019). Similarly, Van Est and Brom (2012, 
312) contend that TA can be “positioned as a more general and open process for 
involving the public in policy dialogues and building societal consensus on issues of 
technological change.” 
What is not clear is how this may be accomplished in developing countries with 
varying levels of capacity to participate. If the underlying assumption of participatory 
TA implies participation of the range of stakeholders impacted by the technology, 
then careful consideration must be given to involving developing countries in these 
processes. Fortunately, the IPCC funding model, which sponsors developing coun-
tries to attend the range of meetings that form the process of the assessment period, 
has allowed for the participation of some key representatives from the developing 
countries at these meetings. However, whether such sponsorship is all inclusive, 
allowing equal participation from the range of developing countries remains to be 
seen. There is also a need to consider how to engage at local sites to maximise stake-
holder participation within countries. Fortunately, the experiences gained from the 
development literature is also of value here, presenting tried and tested processes for 
engaging with local communities across developing countries (Gaventa & Barrett, 
2012; Najam, 2005). 
One example of how collaboration has been facilitated between the developed 
and developing world through multilateral funds is seen in the Kigali Amendment 
to the Montreal Protocol (UNEP, 2021). In the amendment, where countries “agreed 
to phase down Hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs) over the next 30 years and replace them 
with more environmentally friendly alternatives” (UNEP, 2021), it was agreed that 
developed countries would take the lead from 2019 and then, through a phased 
approach, developing countries agreed to “freeze” their HFC levels in subsequent 
years beginning from 2024. All countries participated in reaching the decision, but the 
roll-out approach provided greater consideration to the needs of those in developing 
countries. This provides an example where the developed world took the lead to 
learn the process and then assist developing countries through capacity-building and 
shared knowledge. Such knowledge-sharing across all scales is a key part of the 
successes of the IPCC. 
6 Discussion 
The IPCC model of bringing together scientiﬁc experts from across the world to 
synthesise scientiﬁc evidence that relates to climate change, provides an encour-
aging framework for one possible global TA model. However, given the slow progress 
towards climate mitigation goals we recommend there is a need to address the iden-
tiﬁed deﬁciencies to ensure a truly effective model. There is also scope to better 
understand what the barriers to change have been and then assess whether informa-
tion or political and economic processes are the best ways of addressing these. A

global TA model ideally needs to have some inﬂuence on both policy and real-world 
outcomes to be considered as having impact-providing leadership and direction for 
appropriate and long-lasting solutions to persistent problems. Further, there will 
always be other institutions or actors that produce competing information, including 
regulatory bodies, think tanks and lobby groups on contested issues which govern-
ments and individuals must grapple with (Oreskes & Conway, 2010). TA needs to 
compete with these other forms of information if it is to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
on decision-making at the highest levels, and of course be based on the best scientiﬁc 
evidence. The interplay between governments and researchers in the IPCC process 
provides hope for this. 
The four central challenges of the IPCC identiﬁed were: (a) lack of impact 
through initiating action based on current government commitments; (b) the pursuit 
of consensus-based and situated knowledge; (c) reporting inaccuracies leading to 
mistrust; and (d) accessibility of information across different scales. While these 
deﬁciencies lead to matters of legitimacy, they are not dissimilar to the ongoing 
discussions of TA scholars. We suggest there is potential for each of these deﬁcien-
cies to be addressed using lessons learned from TA scholarship and frameworks that 
may result in more authentic and accepted outcomes. 
For example, establishing legitimacy through TA processes has been fostered 
through the inclusion of participatory TA and deliberative democracy as grassroots 
ways to address matters of scale, inclusivity and knowledge production. Admit-
tedly, there are challenges with translating deliberation in social trust, and results 
can vary depending on how strong a country has been at conducting deliberation 
historically (Jørgensen et al., 2016). This is made even more challenging in poorly 
organised civil societies or in political environments closed from public participa-
tion (Jørgensen et al., 2016). Such considerations are reﬂected in the EUROPTA 
analytical framework (Bellucci et al., 2002), which recognises that within social 
and institutional contexts Participatory TA has three dimensions. These include: 
(i) set-up and process—ultimately focusing on the design and interaction arrange-
ments; (ii) values assumptions and goals—that relate to the problem deﬁnition and 
justiﬁcation for participation; and (iii) outcomes—directly referring to communica-
tion of the results and impact. Importantly, herein remains a normative challenge. 
Neither shared visions nor values result in tangible impact or political outcomes by 
default, and therefore cannot be guaranteed (Delvenne & Parotte, 2019). This could 
be due to a lack of reﬂexivity amongst actors, or an explicit or implicit preference 
towards a matter within TA communities for political reasons (Delvenne & Parotte, 
2019). Whether shared visions or values are aligned or divergent is also a matter for 
consideration across scales. 
Similarly, when considering participatory TA models across jurisdictions, there 
has been extensive debate around whether the processes developed for one country 
can be simply introduced into another country without modiﬁcation (Joss & Torg-
ersen, 2002). Whether this is possible or not, will be inﬂuenced by the role the 
participatory TA method is expected to play. What is the issue being investigated, 
and who should participate to ensure the process is truly inclusive and representative 
across scales? What assessment is being sought and for whom? When considering

142
P. Ashworth and E. Clarke
a global TA participatory framework, it will be important to acknowledge where 
governance systems either converge or diverge, as this will impact the likely success 
of the process and its perceived legitimacy. Similarly, how marginalised groups are 
treated within such participatory processes will also signiﬁcantly affect outcomes 
and whether the results are valued. Trying to extrapolate these considerations across 
scales is not without its challenges, and should not be underestimated. 
In relation to climate change, Michalek et al. (2014, 17) suggest that: “A lack 
of consensus on the global level greatly affects the local, where, for example, the 
negative effects of climate change are often mostly visible. In this sense, sustainable 
behaviour can only be fostered by participation of the general public in local policies 
(e.g. the e2democracy project, 2012).” This global versus local impact is relevant to 
many global challenges beyond climate change, and is why considerations of other 
TA activities that work at different scales is important. This conﬁrms the need for 
an expanded role for participatory TA at the grassroots level while continuing to 
deploy global TA based on either the IPCC or other models. Such a process would 
allow for broader political debate and directly manage the linkages between science, 
policymakers and society more generally (Van Est & Brom, 2012). Subsequently, it 
develops a deeper understanding of the social dimensions of technology (Van Est & 
Brom, 2012), and can foster more viable visions for the future use of technology 
or issues across the different scales and through discussion, helping to facilitate 
knowledge acquisition across broader society, beyond the experts (Ely et al., 2011, 
2). 
Rabinovich et al., (2012, 11) also highlight the value of the interactions and delib-
eration between actors when reconciling trust in science between those communi-
cating the message and those receiving it. “…the success of communication often 
does not reside within the message itself (however masterfully it may be constructed 
and framed), but within the dynamic interaction between the communicating partners 
… Of paramount importance to such interactions is communication partners’ ability 
to recognise each other’s position and the fact that this position may be different from 
one’s own.” This applies for almost any contested topic. It reinforces how the commu-
nication of scientiﬁc information can beneﬁt from public deliberation between actors 
and citizens. Ultimately, this allows for a broader TA model that is inclusive of public 
input, leading to less confusion on the topic. In addition, where scientiﬁc information 
is localised and contextualised this could also improve its accessibility across scales: 
geographical, societal and temporal. 
Outside the IPCC and participatory TA models, there is a clear shift away from 
the linear historical understanding of how technology is incorporated and used in our 
lives. This is important, as technology and society are in a mutually ﬂuid, dynamic 
relationship. Van Est and Brom (2012, 316) note: “During the mid-1980s, the central 
tenet of science and technology studies (STS) became that technology and society 
co-construct each other. This implies that technology not only effects society but is 
also shaped by society.” This interplay is heavily reﬂected in more recent discussions 
surrounding the legitimacy of TA. It is therefore critical that social, economic and 
political dimensions are acknowledged across IPCC processes to further develop 
legitimacy through transparency. This advice is similarly suggested by other scholars

Climate Change—Does the IPCC Model Provide …
143
advocating for ongoing awareness of the political role of science across all forms of 
TA (Delvenne & Parotte, 2019; Van  Est,  2019). 
A word of caution is required in relation to translating the IPCC model into 
one potential global TA framework. One example that shows the difﬁculty in repli-
cating the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). This began with the intention of being a science-led 
arrangement. However, as it failed to gain traction, it subsequently tried to integrate 
governments using the IPCC model, but failed (Larigauderie & Mooney, 2010). 
Criticisms of the IPBES suggest this is because governments saw it as the research 
community attempting to gain inﬂuence over policy rather than a legitimate approach 
to co-design. Other criticisms surrounding the IPBES include the difﬁculties of trying 
to gain consensus over the very localised and regional nature of speciﬁc biodiversity 
loss, compared to the global need to reduce GHG emissions. This need for consensus 
is exacerbated by the increased demand for diversity (i.e. youth, other stakeholders, 
knowledge systems) amongst those participating in the process, beyond just the expert 
view (Diaz-Reviriego et al., 2019). This lack of unity across the scientiﬁc commu-
nity of biodiversity experts has exacerbated its ability to inﬂuence policymakers and 
has negatively impacted its overall credibility (Masood, 2018). However, those from 
within the IPBES are proactively working to overcome these challenges in an attempt 
to maintain the legitimacy of an important scientiﬁc area (Borie et al., 2020). 
A ﬁnal consideration, if the IPCC framework is to be applied more broadly as a 
potential global TA framework, is the issue of funding. In 2017, the IPCC formed an 
ad hoc task group to reﬂect on its ﬁnancial stability because of a concern about the 
overall drop in long-term funding. The establishment of the IPCC Trust Fund early in 
the life of the IPCC has helped it to be sustainable over the longer-term (IPCC, 2017). 
However, this success is very much based on the generous contributions of member 
organisations, combined with the large in-kind contributions from governments who 
provide not only experts and their associated advice and attendance at meetings, 
but also host IPCC events at no charge (Takashima et al. 2010). Reliance on such 
generosity is perhaps one of the greatest weaknesses for the IPCC model if it is to have 
potential as one such global TA model. While this will need special consideration, the 
existence of the EPTA network suggests some governments are already supportive 
of TA, and therefore provides hope that this might be extrapolated to a more global 
approach to funding. As always, consideration for how developing countries are 
provided for within these frameworks must remain a priority. 
7 Conclusions 
The IPCC process as a TA model has achieved signiﬁcant success in raising 
public awareness and informing attitudes towards climate change. Recent reporting 
corresponded with clearly discernible responses from the international community 
charged with policy construction and delivery. This continues to instal optimism in 
the ongoing quest to mitigate climate change impacts. However, despite wider public

144

awareness and engagement across different scales and between diverse actors, there 
are known barriers that have impaired the IPCC’s progress. The problems identi-
ﬁed in this chapter included measuring the effectiveness of impact through commit-
ments, the problematic nature of consensus and accommodating situated knowledge, 
transparency and reporting accuracy and accessibility of information across scales. 
Applying TA analytical and impact frameworks to these problems suggests these 
challenges are not insurmountable, especially when the global successes of the 
IPCC are taken into consideration. Improving transparency through participatory 
approaches across scales is at the heart of TA. There are examples of TA participa-
tory practises in both democratic and non-democratic states which provide further 
insights for building a global TA framework that will help in overcoming the concerns 
surrounding trust, inclusivity and communication across scales. 
All grand challenges, including climate change, need a sustained social and polit-
ical commitment to overcome them. Integral to the IPCC process is the inﬂuence of 
the Panel and the unique co-design elements between government and researchers 
in setting parameters for ongoing assessment and reporting. Coupling these insights 
with the analytical TA framework underscores a process that accommodates the 
ﬂuid nature of how humans and society interact with technology. Using participa-
tory processes, which are mindful of situational and institutional contexts and allow 
stakeholders to co-create their own understandings provides hope for demonstrating 
a concrete way forward: One, that is inclusive of cooperation between the state, 
industry and citizens to inspire and strengthen innovation fairly. The reﬂexive nature 
of participatory TA, combined with the learnings from the IPCC process and its 
interactions with the UNFCCC, solidiﬁes a point of departure for delivering one 
such practical global TA framework more broadly in future.

Challenges of Global Technology 
Assessment in Biotechnology—Bringing 
Clarity and Better Understanding 
in Fragmented Global Governance

Introduction 
Biotechnology deals with a matter that is fundamental to each person on earth: 
life itself. Worldwide, there may be different views on how we deal with different 
forms of life, and to what extent we, as human kind, are at liberty to alter and use 
animals, plants and other organisms for our own beneﬁt. However, the (possible) 
impacts of developments in biotechnology touch on fundamental and universally-
shared concerns such as our (shared) genetic heritage, illness and health, the safety 
and availability of food, and even the continued existence of our planet. In the current 
globalized world, a French scientist and an American scientist jointly won the Nobel 
prize (Ledford & Callaway, 2020) for a discovery that was used by a Chinese scientist 
to modify the genome of two embryos that grew into babies (Greely, 2019); a virus 
that originated in China has been able to bring nations worldwide to a halt, and 
(GM) crops, livestock products and food are distributed and eaten across the globe 
(MacDonald, 2015). Biotechnology therefore requires reﬂection on a global scale as 
well as international standards, agreements, and regulations. 
Biotechnology involves the use and manipulation of living organisms such as 
plants, animals, humans, and biological systems, or parts of these, to modify their

characteristics in order to create desired organisms or products. Traditional forms 
of such processes, such as brewing, baking, and fermenting with selected micro-
organisms, or breeding of animals and plants, have been utilized by humans for 
centuries, and are referred to as “old” biotechnology. In the 1970s, new methods to 
directly manipulate genes were developed. This ﬁeld of genetic engineering forms 
the basis of “new” biotechnology, opening up a large amount of possible new appli-
cations in the ﬁelds of medicine, agriculture, and industry. But, it also raises a vast 
array of concerns, such as environmental and (human) health risks, moral objec-
tions to tampering with nature, and possible wider societal impacts. As such, new 
biotechnology has led to both public and political concerns. 
This chapter investigates how technology assessment (TA) can contribute to 
a global approach to dealing with global issues concerning the use of biotech-
nology. Biotechnology development touches on many aspects that are central to 
TA. Concerns about the impact of engineered organisms on the environment, ethical 
issues regarding the relationships between humans and nature, and contributions to 
economic growth and broad prosperity are all factors that affect the societal accept-
ability of biotechnology. These factors clearly highlight a need for governance and 
legislation, since the interests of all stakeholders need to be taken into account. 
From the ﬁrst breakthroughs in the 1970s, several activities have been undertaken 
to debate biotechnology developments and establish instruments for their gover-
nance. Examples of TA activities are stakeholder consultations evaluating the envi-
ronmental risks of engineered organisms, analysis of the economic opportunities of 
biotechnology products, and ethical assessment of the modiﬁcation of the genome of 
future generations. Similarly, instruments for the governance of biotechnology have 
taken shape on a global scale in different forms, for example regulating the trade of 
biotechnology products through trade agreements,1 or ﬁxing values in human rights 
treaties regarding the human genome.2 However, developing governance structures 
on a global scale is challenging, because of regional cultural and social differences 
(Ladikas et al., 2015), and because there is no global authority that can adopt and 
enforce binding rules at the global level (Marchant, 2021). 
In this chapter, we examine what institutions and types of regulations organize 
global governance on these matters; what (available) TA studies, insights and method-
ologies have contributed to global reﬂection, deliberation and governance; and what 
the challenges, requirements and opportunities for global TA are when dealing with 
issues concerning biotechnology. Section 2 gives a general introduction to inter-
national developments and governance responses concerning biotechnology since 
the 1970s. In Sect. 3, we discuss the global debate and activities in the ﬁeld of TA 
on three key topics in biotechnology: genetically modiﬁed (GM) food and crops, 
synthetic biology, and human genome germline editing (HGGE). In Sect. 4, we  
discuss public perceptions, representing the cultural differences and perspectives

that need to be taken into account when trying to ﬁnd ways toward global gover-
nance of biotechnology. In the ﬁnal section, we reﬂect on the way ahead for global 
TA of biotechnology.

Early Developments in Biotechnology and Its Governance 
An important breakthrough for modern biotechnology was the development of 
recombinant DNA technologies in the 1970s, with which DNA can be implanted 
(via a virus) into the genome of a bacterium (Jackson et al., 1972). From the begin-
ning, it was evident that this was a controversial technology, encompassing both 
great potential beneﬁts and risks. Therefore, activities to investigate and debate the 
consequences of biotechnology, and the possible actions that can be taken to mitigate 
the potential risks while stimulating the potential beneﬁts were soon initiated. 
A well-known example of this was what later came to be known as the Asilomar 
Conference. Biochemist Paul Berg, together with other scientists, initiated a volun-
tary moratorium on performing experiments with recombinant DNA technologies, 
awaiting an international conference regarding the biohazards of such experiments 
(Berg, 2008). At the 1975 International Congress on Recombinant DNA Molecules, 
at the Asilomar Conference Center in California, 140 biologists, lawyers, physicists, 
journalists, and government ofﬁcials discussed the conditions under which exper-
iments could safely continue. The recommendations formulated at the conference 
outlined the types of containment in the laboratory for different types of experiments. 
These recommendations formed the basis for the US National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) guidelines that were established in 1976. According to organizer Paul Berg, 
the Asilomar Conference is a good example of gaining the public’s trust in science 
by taking their concerns seriously, and openly discussing the risks and the consider-
ations that led to the resulting consensus. However, the Asilomar Conference is also 
criticized for adopting a narrow view of “risk”, omitting other implications, such 
as social, political, and economic factors (Hurlbut et al., 2015). Similarly, a narrow 
range of viewpoints was included, as most participants were biologists from the US, 
with a few from Europe and none from the developing world, and no experts from 
other ﬁelds (i.e. social sciences) were included. Another criticism is that the confer-
ence focused overly on worst-case scenarios, setting a precedent for other debates 
about biotechnology and having a negative effect on public trust (Briggle, 2005). 
Thus, in hindsight the Asilomar Conference was perhaps not the best approach to 
discuss risk and uncertainty in science, technology and innovation. 
Since the days of the Asimolar Conference, much better methods to take into 
account (often uncertain) impacts on both the environment and society of innova-
tion, including genetic engineering, have been established in the related ﬁelds of 
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) and Technology Assessment. RRI is 
distinctive from TA by adding explicit ethical reﬂection (Grunwald, 2011). It has its 
origins in the need to address concerns with the emerging ﬁeld of nanotechnology in 
the 2000s, in order to avoid negative impacts and to prevent the lack of acceptance

and active resistance by the public, as was the case with biotechnology (Rip, 2014). 
Moreover, as a response to the developments in biotechnology, many approaches to 
TA that emphasize public participation were developed (Einsiedel, 2012). 
The ﬁrst practical and commercial applications of biotechnologies emerged in 
the 1980s, together with the ﬁrst regulations. For example, the ﬁrst ﬁrms exploiting 
recombinant DNA technology were founded, the US Supreme Court ruled that 
recombinant micro-organisms can be patented under existing law, and a technique for 
recombination of DNA was patented. The judgment in Chakrabarty versus Diamond 
(1980) in the US paved the way for this, and resulted in rewriting the law in patenting 
of products of nature. This enabled the then nascent biotechnology industry to 
use intellectual property rights as a strategic tool for growth and attracting invest-
ments.3 In 1982, the production of synthetic human insulin in a genetically modiﬁed 
bacterium (E.coli) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As 
the commercial and international aspects of biotechnology became evident, TA activ-
ities that also include these aspects were initiated. In the US, the Ofﬁce of Technology 
Assessment (OTA) published the report “Commercial Biotechnology: An Interna-
tional Analysis” (OTA, 1984), and a series of ﬁve reports on “New Developments in 
Biotechnology” in the late 1980s.4 
In the 1980s and 1990s, the possible risks and beneﬁts of biotechnology on a 
global scale were addressed by institutions such as the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Food and Agricultural Organization of 
the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). Attempts were made to deal with global issues related to 
biotechnology, i.e., to set up structures for the governance of biotechnology through 
international consensus, coordination, and agreements. The OECD issued a report 
on international trends and perspectives on biotechnology in 1982, addressing the 
potential hazards of releasing genetically modiﬁed organisms into the environment 
(Bull et al.,  1982). It also addressed the relationships between academic institutions 
and industry, and between fundamental and practical knowledge, with regards to 
biotechnology. The report also mentions the need for international discussion and 
coordination concerning the patenting of life-based products and safety issues in 
order to avoid differences in legislation and practice between countries. The OECD 
has since addressed issues related to biotechnology regularly. In 1993, the OECD 
established the Internal Co-ordination Group for Biotechnology (ICGB) to coor-
dinate the impacts of biotechnology on different sectors such as: agriculture and 
trade; environment; science, technology and industry, bringing together different 
working groups, working parties, committees and fora that have activities related to 
biotechnology (OECD, 2021).

In 1991, the FAO and WHO released a joint consultation report on the safety of 
food produced by biotechnology, which was meant as a ﬁrst step toward international 
consensus and providing guidance for the safety assessment of foods obtained using 
biotechnologies (FAO & WHO, 1982). In 1994, the WTO attempted to facilitate 
global trade by bridging the differences in Intellectual Property (IP) rights among 
its members and setting global standards, with the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). According to the TRIPS agree-
ment, the requirements for patentability, i.e., novelty, inventiveness and industrial 
utility, apply to biotechnology inventions as well. Hence, if new biological mate-
rial is obtained through non-biological processes (such as genetic engineering), it 
is patentable. Member states do have the freedom to exclude plants, animals, and 
“essentially biological processes” from patentability.5 
Biotechnology has been a central topic in the (institutionalized/parliamentary) 
TA community since the ﬁrst OTA reports in the 1980s. From early on, an important 
question has been how to balance precaution with obtaining the possible beneﬁts of 
biotechnology through regulation (POST, 1994; Torgersen & Bogner, 2004). This 
has been an ongoing discussion, as new developments in the ﬁeld reveal gaps in the 
existing rules and regulations (see for example Habets et al., 2019 on the regulation 
of genome editing of plants and crops using novel gene editing technologies in the 
EU). 
3 
Key Topics in Biotechnology 
In this section, we introduce three key topics in biotechnology: (i) genetically modi-
ﬁed (GM) foods and crops, (ii) synthetic biology, and (iii) human genome germline 
editing (HGGE). Although these three topics do not cover all existing developments 
in biotechnology (i.e., pharmaceuticals, industrial biotechnology, genetic informa-
tion, and privacy, etc.), together they cover many issues that are relevant for global 
governance of biotechnology in general. GM foods touch upon global trade and 
innovative competitiveness that can be in conﬂict with regional rules and values. It 
foregrounds issues such as food security, consumer rights to information, and trans-
parent food labeling. The emergence of synthetic biology foregrounds issues of dual 
use and biosecurity. HGGE is considered to require a global approach as the human 
genome is often seen as matter that concerns all of humanity (i.e., a “heritage of 
humanity” in the words of UNESCO).

3.1 
Genetically Modiﬁed Foods and Crops 
GM foods and crops are presented as a possible solution to hunger by organizations 
such as the United Nations (UN, 2021) and the WHO (WHO, 2021), as genetic 
engineering might increase crop yields, resistance against insects and disease, and 
nutritional values. The advantage of genetic engineering over traditional methods 
to breed new varieties of crops is that genes that code directly for a desired trait 
can directly be transferred from one variety to another. This makes it a faster and 
more accurate method. Moreover, the transfer of genes from one species to another 
is also possible. Hence, traits that naturally do not appear in a certain species can be 
introduced. 
But, it has also led to ﬁerce opposition by NGOs, for example by Greenpeace, 
which is internationally lobbying against GMOs because of the unknown risks and 
their unforeseeable environmental, social and health impacts (Greenpeace, 2021). 
One of the major concerns is that the novel gene might be transferred to other plants, 
such as wild relatives of the crop species, leading to the development of resistant 
“super weeds” and the destabilization of ecosystems. Other concerns relate to risks 
for human health, for example, when novel genes that originate from species that are 
usually not eaten by humans or animals are introduced to food crops. The concern 
is that this might lead to the introduction of unknown allergens into the food chain. 
Other objections to GM crops include tampering with nature, the monopolization 
of agrochemical and plant breeding companies, and negative consequences of intro-
ducing GM crops to agriculture, such as upscaling and a high use of pesticides and 
herbicides. In addition, freedom of choice for consumers and trade issues are consid-
ered to be important issues (Habets et al., 2019). The system of IP and patenting 
can lead to monopolization of GM seed producers and push prices up. If, as a result, 
only rich and large companies are able to afford the more expensive GM seeds, then 
the cultivation of GM crops will largely be in the hands of large companies, and 
small farmers might not be able to beneﬁt from increased yields of GM crops. The 
humanitarian argument that GM food technologies might help to feed hungry people 
is thus contested by the concern that the beneﬁts might not be equally distributed. 
The global debate and governance of GM food 
As food is traded across the globe, the governance of GM food and crops on a global 
scale mostly applies to trade-related agreements. The TRIPS agreement (1994) has 
helped globalization of biotechnology as it expanded the scope for patenting, and 
the leeway to exclude from patentability was limited. This could make investing in 
the development of GMOs more proﬁtable. Under Article 27.3(b) patents on plant 
varieties was made possible, and although “essentially biological processes” could 
be excluded from patenting, patenting of plant varieties opened up the scope for 
patents on GMOs, and processes related to developing GMOs; as patents can also 
cover seeds, it ensured that plant variety protection was available for GM crops. The 
TRIPS Agreement, while providing ﬂexibility to countries on granting IP rights over 
plant varieties, ensured that at least some form of protection should be granted. By

Challenges of Global Technology Assessment …
155
expanding the scope of IP rights on plant varieties, it also transformed the IP rights 
scenario related to seeds. 
This ﬂexibility left countries with limited choices, as they had to grant at least some 
form of IP protection rather than exempting plants and seeds, as was possible before. 
Because biotechnology was increasingly used to develop new plant varieties with 
new traits, IP protection was increasingly sought and granted on DNA fragments, 
genetically modiﬁed gene parts, and genetically modiﬁed organisms including plants. 
This expansion helped large companies like Monsanto to capitalize on IP protection 
and to consolidate their position in the global seed industry. In developing countries, 
such as Argentina and in India, such moves were met with resistance. In India, the 
government resorted to price control and reduced the amount of royalty demanded 
by Monsanto-Mahyco (Van Dycke & Van Overwalle, 2017). Whether or not the 
scope of this protection extended to subsequent generations of cultivars became a 
contentious issue in the US and Canada, where more than one form of IP protection 
was available. 
The TRIPS agreement has also been resisted by developing countries for not sufﬁ-
ciently taking into account cultural, political-economic and ecological dimensions, 
and for pushing globalization while disadvantaging local practices (McAfee, 2003). 
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety aims to protect biological diversity from 
the potential adverse effects of GMOs. It is an international agreement annexed to 
the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity, entering into force in 2003. Central to 
the Protocol is the precautionary principle, which states that a lack of full scientiﬁc 
certainty is no reason to postpone measures to avoid or minimize risks posed by a 
living modiﬁed organism resulting from biotechnology. It allows developing nations 
to balance public health with economic beneﬁts. The Cartagena Protocol applies 
to the transboundary movement, transit, handling, and use of all living modiﬁed 
organisms that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use 
of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health (Article 4 of 
the Protocol, SCBD 2000). Some major GM crop-producing countries (i.e., the US, 
Argentina, and Canada) have not ratiﬁed the Cartagena Protocol, while others (India 
and Brazil) have. 
Central to regulation of GM foods, plants and crops are containment of risks, trans-
parency, freedom of consumer choice, and marketing issues. Therefore, regulatory 
regimes lay out rules for risk assessment, risk containment and labeling, and among 
others. The EU currently has the most harmonized and comprehensive framework for 
GMOs, covering contained use, ﬁeld trials, marketing of GMOs, post-market moni-
toring, labeling, and traceability (Srinivas, 2020). Commercial cultivation of GM 
crops only occurs in Spain, but large amounts of GM soya and corn are imported as 
animal feed. Similar to the Cartagena Protocol, the precautionary principle is a funda-
mental principle of European legislation, and the EU GMO Directive 2001/18/EG is 
in line with this principle. 
Fundamentally, there are two ways for countries to assess the risks of and regulate 
GMO crops: process based—deﬁning plant varieties based on the process by which 
they were created, and product based—deﬁning plant varieties based on the proper-
ties of the resulting product. The EU is an example of the ﬁrst: classic mutagenesis

156
S. van Baalen et al.
methods, introducing small, random changes to the DNA of crops are exempted 
from the GMO Directive, because no foreign DNA is introduced. The recent emer-
gence of new genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, allow for the dele-
tion or replacement of single base-pairs, rather than introduction of foreign DNA 
as in recombinant DNA techniques. In the EU, this has sparked a debate about 
whether genome-edited crops should fall under the GMO Directive. Proponents argue 
that genome editing techniques are similar to classic mutagenesis techniques, as no 
foreign DNA is introduced. Opponents argue that safety for public health and the 
environment has not been proven. In 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that 
gene-edited crops should be considered as GMOs. 
The US is an example of the product-based approach to regulating GM food, 
where regulations are based on the GM foods and how they are used, rather than the 
technologies that were used to make them. Hence, the safety of GM foods in the US is 
assessed using the same rules as all other foods, and no special labeling or pre-market 
approval applies. The introduction of GM plants in the ﬁeld is regulated by the US 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) that prevents the spread of (potentially) invasive 
new plants in the US. USDA requires companies to submit information on the plant, 
such as ﬁeld test reports, experimental data, and publication and description of the 
genotype and phenotype, before GM plants can be planted, and regulates where GM 
can be transported and how much can be planted. Finally, if GM plants produce 
insecticidal substances, regulations concerning the effect of pesticides on human 
health and the environment apply.6 
According to a survey among 33 countries and the EU, process-based regulations 
were employed by 15 countries and the EU, among which are Brazil, China, New 
Zealand, and Australia, whereas 14 countries employed product-based regulation, 
including Argentina, the US, Canada, the Philippines, and Bangladesh (Ishii & Araki, 
2017). Hence, the regulatory landscape for GM foods is fragmented globally, and 
there is no harmonization of norms and rules of GM foods across the world. A current 
pressing issue is how different regulatory regimes will react to genetically edited 
foods. Some countries might choose the option of deregulation of genome edited 
crops, or treating genome edited crops as equivalent to plant species developed by 
traditional plant breeding methods, while others might treat genome edited crops as 
GMOs. 
TA work on GM foods 
GM foods have long been on the agenda of TA institutes, raising questions concerning 
biodiversity and sustainability (i.e., Meyer et al., 1998), as well as social conse-
quences (i.e., BAS, 2008). TA has also been concerned with the public and political 
debate, organizing citizen panels (i.e. TA-Swiss, 1999 and many more, see Einsiedel, 
2012, Table 1 for an overview), and monitoring technical and scientiﬁc developments. 
In 2009, the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network issued 
a report about the challenges to European policy on GM plants (Bütschi et al., 2009).

(accessed 8-4-2022). 

Challenges of Global Technology Assessment …

These challenges related to new driving forces for GM plant introduction, including 
agriculture for non-food products such as bioenergy and biomass; the development 
of new types of GM plants, technologies and applications; public acceptance of 
GM plants; labeling of GM products, and consumer choice and international trade 
rules. On each of these issues, the EPTA network provides options for action to 
policymakers. 
In recent decades, public discourse and policymaking have been focused around 
regulations and issues like food safety and environmental impact. Likewise, the 
concerns regarding genetically edited crops have also been on governance and regu-
lation (Entine et al., 2021) or on risk assessment (Kawall et al., 2020). Here, discus-
sions have also focused more on speciﬁc aspects than on a holistic assessment.7 One 
of the aims of TA, however, is to include other impacts of technological develop-
ments like GM food, such as economic impacts, environmental impacts, impacts on 
women, impacts on health, and impacts on labor (Chaturvedi & Srinivas, 2019). TA 
methods could be helpful to assess such broad impacts of GM foods. Moreover, the 
issues and impacts of GM foods are not similar for each country: there are different 
regulations, needs, and cultures in each country. A globalized TA effort can help to 
gain insight into the broad implications of (the governance of) GM foods for the 
diverse situations in various countries across the globe, and the impact of globally 
standardized governance in each of these situations.

Synthetic Biology 
In the early 2000s, synthetic biology (or SynBio) emerged at the center of biotech-
nology developments. Synthetic biology is the engineering of biology to (re)design 
organisms or complex biologically-based systems which display functions that do not 
exist in nature and that are useful for mankind. A fundamental difference between 
genetic engineering and synthetic biology is that, with the latter, it is possible to 
redesign a biological system or organism, or to create a totally new organism not 
found in nature. As such, synthetic biology creates new opportunities and raises 
new expectations and concerns. Therefore, existing regulatory regimes created for 
genetic engineering may not be suitable to regulate synthetic biology (Srinivas, 2020). 
Globally, a Do-It-Yourself biology (DIY biology) movement has emerged making 
protocols and kits available online, allowing amateurs to experiment with synthetic 
biology at home. The DIY biology movement is now diverse in terms of geography 
and location. The international genetically engineered machine (iGEM) competition, 
held since 2004, provides a platform for novel ideas and experiments in synthetic 
biology. So far, synthetic biology has not been dominated by multinational corpora-
tions and there are strong countervailing forces like the DIY biology movement to 
prevent this.

The global debate and governance of synthetic biology 
The discourse about synthetic biology is fueled by its potential beneﬁts, such as 
the production of medicine by artiﬁcial bacteria, biofuel from algae, or developing 
biosensors that improve measuring instruments. At the same time, synthetic biology 
raises concerns. How far can we intervene in the living world? Can we foresee the 
consequences? The international debates relate to issues of biosafety and biosecurity, 
intellectual property and the international framework on ethics and human rights. 
Across the globe, different discourses relating to innovation, risk, power and control 
have emerged, involving different actors. In contrast to the ﬁrst attempts at regulating 
genetic engineering, which was mainly initiated by experts at the Asilomar Confer-
ence, many different actors, including NGOs, have been involved from the beginning, 
and the need to incorporate stakeholder and public questions and concerns into poli-
cymaking has been on the agenda from an early stage (Stemerding & Rerimassie, 
2013). Moreover, the global nature of the developments, due to the international inter-
connectedness of academic disciplines and the industrial sector, has been mentioned 
as one of the central features of synthetic biology (ibid.). This brings out the need for 
transnational governance and international coordination. Currently, governance of 
synthetic biology is evolving, with countries following different approaches (Trump 
et al., 2020) without moving toward global harmonization. However, the extension 
of regulatory regimes developed for genetic engineering/GMOs is also emerging as 
an option. The ongoing discussions under the Convention on Biological Diversity 
relate to the question of whether synthetic biology would be covered by the Carta-
gena Protocol on Biosafety (Lai et al., 2019). Synthetic biology was discussed at 
the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Ad-hoc Technical Experts Group 
(AHTEFG), but there was no consensus on the assessment of new genetic technolo-
gies, such as synthetic biology. Major differences occurred between parties that grow 
and export GM crops and other parties that take more precautionary approaches. The 
AHTEFG has proposed establishing a “Multidisciplinary Technical Expert Group 
on Synthetic Biology to carry out the horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment 
process” (Third World Network, 2021). 
TA and synthetic biology 
Synthetic biology is currently receiving much attention from the (institu-
tional/parliamentary) TA community (i.e., EPTA, 2011; POST,  2008, 2014; 
Stemerding & Rerimassie, 2013; TAB,  2015). Synthetic biology has dual-use poten-
tial and there are concerns about biosecurity, the potential for misuse and biosafety, 
and the potential unintended consequences of the technology (see: NASEM, 2018). 
One suggestion has been that prospective TA in combination with ethics is necessary 
(Schmidt, 2015), or that it can be complemented with an analysis based on Respon-
sible Research and Innovation (RRI) (Stemerding, 2019). One way to go about this is 
to review the literature and case studies of TA in dual use in other ﬁelds such as cyber-
security (e.g. Riebe & Reuter, 2019), and draw lessons from that. Synthetic biology 
was one of the topics of the Global Ethics in Science and Technology (GEST) project 
(2011–2014), which compared the role of ethics in science and technology policy

as it was developing in Europe, China and India. But the real challenge lies in using 
TA in technological convergence: the “tendency of different systems to eventually 
evolve, blend, and synergistically reinforce and interact with each other, sharing and 
extracting resources and energy to produce new and unique meta-technological prod-
ucts and outcomes” (McCreight, 2013, p. 12). This convergence has the potential to 
improve human lives, but also to be put to use in warfare and, as such, have disastrous 
consequences for the global balance of power. Synthetic biology is often mentioned 
as one of the technologies that has this potential, together with artiﬁcial intelligence, 
neuroscience, nanoscience and robotics. Utilizing foresight methodologies from TA, 
such as scenario analyzes and horizon scans, can be helpful in developing gover-
nance that anticipates future developments. An example is the techno-moral future 
scenarios on synthetic biology, developed by the Rathenau Instituut and the 2012 
iGEM University College London team.8 Together, they present a range of possible 
futures for synthetic biology in our society and in our lives, and support politicians, 
scientists and the broader public to reﬂect on the possible positive and negative 
impacts. This facilitates the conversation between policymakers, stakeholders and 
the public about what role they envision for synthetic biology in society, and how 
we can stimulate this through governance while limiting the negative consequences. 
3.3 
Human Genome Germline Editing (HGGE) 
In the ﬁrst decades after 1970, the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology 
focused on environmental and health risks and (global) trade, but in the 1990s the 
assessment of underlying values and the role of ethical principles for the governance 
of biotechnology became more prominent. As the science of genetic engineering and 
molecular biology progressed, attention turned toward the engineering of the human 
genome. In 2003, the entire human genetic code was mapped for the ﬁrst time, the 
outcome of the Human Genome Project which had started in 1990 (NIH, 2021). The 
expanding knowledge of the genetic basis of human traits and disorders, and new 
technologies for modifying genes, could in time make it possible to alter the building 
blocks of our lives: human DNA. When the DNA in the cell of a human embryo or in 
cells that could grow into reproductive cells is modiﬁed in the laboratory, we speak of 
human germline genome editing (HGGE). When a child grows out of a genetically 
modiﬁed embryo, the DNA of their offspring will also contain the modiﬁcation. 
HGGE could have a variety of social repercussions that require governance with a 
strong basis in values from society.

S. van Baalen et al.
The global debate and governance of HGGE 
In response, international and global agencies have attempted to curtail modiﬁcations 
of the human genome through regulations and treaties. In most countries, human 
genome editing is prohibited by law (Ledford, 2015). In addition to national prohibi-
tions, various human rights treaties curtail modiﬁcations of the human germline, such 
as the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UNESCO, 
1997), which considers the human genome as “the fundamental unity of all members 
of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diver-
sity. In a symbolic sense, it is the heritage of humanity.” (Article 1) The Council of 
Europe addressed genetic modiﬁcation of the human genome in Article 13 of the 
Oviedo Convention, stating that an intervention to modify the human genome may 
only be undertaken for preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, and only if its 
aim is not to introduce any modiﬁcation in the genome of any descendants (Council 
of Europe, 1997). In the European Union, eugenic practices and cloning of human 
beings are both deemed to be in violation of human dignity and are rejected in Art. 
3(2b) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2000). More recently, the European 
Clinical Trial Regulation (2014), which entered into force in 2019, also prohibits 
the alteration of heritable DNA by providing that, “No gene therapy clinical trials 
may be carried out which result in modiﬁcations to the subject’s germ line genetic 
identity.” (European Clinical Trial Regulation, 2014, p. 51). 
In 2012, a new technology was discovered for modifying DNA: CRISPR-Cas9 
(Jinek et al., 2012). In contrast to earlier genome editing technologies, CRISPR is 
often referred to as a ‘molecular scissor’. Scientists regard the technology as ‘easy to 
use, precise and relatively inexpensive’. Within the medical ﬁeld, scientists, doctors 
and patients hopefully anticipate the possibility of preventing the transmission of 
(severe) heritable diseases through HGGE (De Wert et al., 2018; Liang, 2015).This 
development has reopened the discussion about the modiﬁcation of heritable DNA. 
At the international level, different initiatives to discuss and reﬂect on human 
genome editing have been initiated. For example, at the two “International summits 
on genome editing” in 2015 and 20189 experts have discussed the scientiﬁc state-
of-the-art and the ethical and societal questions, and concluded that it was, at that 
time, irresponsible to use germline genome editing in a clinical setting, to alter the 
genetic make-up of future persons. Firstly, because the technology was deemed not 
safe and efﬁcient enough, and secondly, because of a lack of broad societal consensus 
about the acceptability of clinical use of HGGE. Despite worldwide consensus that 
the use of gene editing technologies to modify the DNA of future persons is not 
acceptable due to ethical concerns, as well as issues with safety and efﬁcacy, and 
despite that HGGE for reproductive purposes were prohibited, the Chinese scientist 
He Jiankui announced that the world’s ﬁrst gene edited babies had been born in China 
on November 26, 2018 (Cohen, 2019). This led to an outburst of reactions from within 
and outside the academic community, and calls to consider a temporary worldwide 
ban on the reproductive applications of HGGE until adequate reﬂection has taken

(accessed 8-4-2022).

161
place at the national and international levels (i.e. Lander et al., 2019). It soon became 
clear that many scientists from around the world were aware of He’s plans to let babies 
grow out of genetically altered embryos (Cyranoski, 2019). The announcement by 
He Jiankui was taken by the Chinese government as an opportunity to enhance the 
ethical governance of emerging technologies by establishing a National Science and 
Technology Ethics Committee and issuing the “Regulations on the Administration 
of the Clinical Application of New Biomedical Technologies”, which improved the 
management system for the clinical application of new biomedical technologies at 
different risk levels. 
In the aftermath of this incident, the WHO founded the advisory commission 
on Developing Global Standards for Governance and Oversight of Human Genome 
Editing, that issued a Framework for Governance and Recommendations on the 
topic in 2021. In this set of documents, the committee gives advice and recom-
mendations on appropriate institutional, national, regional, and global governance 
mechanisms for HGGE.10 It recognizes that governance is needed at national and 
transnational levels, because both the research and the societal effects will go beyond 
national borders. Therefore, it recommends that the WHO should take leadership 
and work with others to establish international collaborations for effective gover-
nance and oversight. According to the committee, good governance in this context 
is value-based and principle-driven, and it provides a list of the values and princi-
ples that should inform governance decisions. By putting forward seven scenarios, 
the committee illustrates the practical challenges that can be encountered when 
establishing good governance of HGGE. 
In 2020, the US National Academy of Science and the UK Royal Society Interna-
tional Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing issued 
a report that aims to provide a “translational pathway” from preclinical research to 
clinical application that governments can use to introduce HGGE in their countries 
should they decide to permit such use (NAM, NAS, and the Royal Society, 2020). 
Notably, it also asserts that “extensive social dialog should be undertaken before 
any country makes a decision on whether to permit clinical use of heritable human 
genome editing (HHGE).” 
Because the current global regulatory landscape regarding HGGE is very frag-
mented and no global authority that can adopt and enforce binding rules at the global 
level exists, it is unlikely that a single mechanism will be sufﬁcient. A mixture 
of different soft-law mechanisms, such as international registries, conferences and 
(nonbinding) governance frameworks by international organizations such as WHO, 
and guidelines from professional societies such as the US National Academy of 
Science and the UK Royal Society will nonetheless be beneﬁcial to develop global 
consensus about what HGGE activities are ethically unacceptable, and mechanisms 
to detect and report them (Marchant, 2021).

TA and HGGE 
In the early 2000s, the main concern raised by TA was the possibility to read the 
human genome (PACE, 2001; POST,  2000), and this is still an ongoing debate (POST, 
2015; STOA,  2008, 2021). TA institutes have analyzed the possible beneﬁts of these 
developments, such as more precise characterization of medical conditions, better 
diagnostics and disease prevention, as well as potential (unwanted) impacts such as 
the commercialization of (individual) genetic information. More recently, the possi-
bility to edit human DNA has technically become more realistic, with the discovery 
of “genetic scissors” CRISPR-Cas9. TA institutes have assessed the possible beneﬁts, 
risks and ethical issues of these developments concerning genome editing in plants, 
animals and humans (ITA, 2016; POST,  2016; TAB,  2015; Van Baalen et al., 2020), 
and have been involved in the organization and analysis of broad public dialogs about 
HGGE (Van Baalen et al., 2021). For this dialog, a set of four techno-moral future 
scenarios were developed.11 
4 
Public Engagement in Biotechnology and TA 
As one of the central aims of TA is to aid the democratic control of developments 
in STI, participation of a range of stakeholders and the wider public is an important 
element of TA. This is all the more important for TA of biotechnology, as biotech-
nology challenges some of the conceptualizations that people use to make sense of 
the world, such as between sickness, health and enhancement, between living and 
non-living, between nature and technology, and between biology and engineering. 
Moreover, over recent decades, the debate has broadened from micro-organisms to 
plants to human beings (STOA, 2008). As these developments have such a tremen-
dous impact on our bodies, lives and surroundings, they should not be left to driving 
forces such as science, industries and markets. Rather, policymakers and citizens— 
the public-should be aware of the developments and enabled to take part in the 
discussion about their desirability and acceptability. 
Moreover, citizens are demanding to have a say in the governance of these devel-
opments: from the 1990s onward, biotechnology has increasingly became the subject 
of public and societal debate, often sparked by single events, such as the creation of 
Herman the transgenic bull in the Netherlands in 1990, the ﬁrst commercial produc-
tion of GM food in the US in 1994, and Dolly the cloned sheep in 1996 (see: Einsiedel, 
2012; Hansen, 2011). In the early 2000s, public concern with genetic engineering, 
most notably genetically modiﬁed crops and other food products has had consider-
able inﬂuence on GMO policy throughout the globe. As such, an important task of 
TA in biotechnology is to include a range of perspectives from the public and societal 
groups in the assessment of technologies.

Box 1. Public Attitudes to Human Genome Germline Editing (HGGE) 
Public surveys 
Public surveys in China and the US show that 72.5%, 72.8%, and 70.9% of 
Chinese respondents clearly expressed their support for the clinical use of 
HGGE to prevent fatal diseases, prevent non-fatal diseases, and reduce the 
possibility of serious diseases, respectively, compared to 71%, 67%, and 65%, 
respectively, in the US. Nearly half of the Chinese public supported the clinical 
use of HGGE for the purpose of enhancement, a larger proportion than that of 
the American public (48.6% vs. 12%). 
An international survey among Canada, the US, Brazil, Germany, Sweden, 
the Netherlands, the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, 
South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia (Pew 
Research Center, 2020a), shows that 70% of participants think it is appropriate 
to use HGGE to treat a serious disease or condition the baby would have 
at birth, 60% think it is appropriate to use HGGE to reduce the risk of a 
serious disease or condition that could occur over the baby’s lifetime, and 14% 
say it is appropriate to use HGGE to make the baby more intelligent. The 
third scenario evokes the widest diversity of opinions across publics: from 8% 
percent agreement in Japan to 64% agreement in India. 
Societal dialog 
In the Netherlands, politicians request societal dialog about controversial 
topics. In 2019 and 2020, a broad societal dialog to ascertain the views of society 
towards the clinical application of HGGE was organized by a consortium of 
Dutch societal partners, ﬁnanced by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and 
Sport (Van Baalen et al., 2021). In general, participants had no fundamental and 
absolute objections towards HGGE technology. However, they only deemed 
HGGE to be acceptable when it is used to prevent serious, heritable diseases 
and under strict conditions, without affecting important (societal) values. A 
small group of participants found HGGE fundamentally unacceptable because 
it would cross natural, socio-ethical or religious boundaries. 69% of the respon-
dents agreed with HGGE to prevent a serious muscular disease, 37% agreed 
with HGGE to protect a child against a serious infectious disease, and 8% 
agreed with HGGE to make a future child more intelligent (DNA-dialoog, 
2021). Compared to the respondents in the Chinese and US studies, the Dutch 
respondents are more cautious towards the use of HGGE. 
Biotechnology and the need to include public perspectives have been an important 
factor in the establishment of TA-institutions throughout Europe and the development 
of approaches to TA that emphasize public participation, such as participatory or 
interactive TA, and related methodology, such as consensus conferences (Einsiedel, 
2012). Different issues play a role in these debates. For example, religious beliefs 
and concepts of nature, health, disease, and parenthood. Members of the public

164
S. van Baalen et al.
voice ethical concerns on “messing with nature” or “playing god” when intervening 
in the fundamental building blocks of plants, animals or humans is discussed (Evans, 
2001). But they are also concerned with the direct and indirect risks of using advanced 
genetic engineering technologies when not all aspects of the biology are known. Can 
we introduce genetically modiﬁed plants or animals safely into the environment? 
Are GM foods safe to eat? Is it possible that artiﬁcially introduced genes may be 
transferred to natural forms? And does this impose a threat to the natural environment 
and biodiversity? And how can we make sure that targeted DNA-modiﬁcation of 
an embryo (a future child) does not introduce off-target modiﬁcation. Moreover, 
the public is also concerned with the interests of other stakeholders: who decides 
whether these risks are acceptable and who will beneﬁt? Especially in the debate 
on GM crops, the concentration of power in large, global agrochemical and plant 
breeding companies is objected to, while in the debate on HGGE, the public is 
concerned with long-term social consequences, such as the genetic consolidation 
of pre-existing socio-economic inequalities (Van Baalen et al., 2020; Habets et al., 
2019). 
Despite these concerns, almost all the scientiﬁc associations and UN organiza-
tions such as FAO and WHO are assured that GM foods are safe. More importantly 
the reports (i.e., FAO, 2004; NAS, 2014; Nufﬁeld, 1999) point out the need to take 
into account concerns related to ethics and values and urge greater engagement with 
the public and better communication on risk and beneﬁts. A report about TA on 
converging technologies by STOA (Panel for the Future of Science and Technology 
at the European Parliament) concludes that “there was a need for values and criteria” 
and that “almost all agreed on a need for more public input” because “there is still 
little awareness about converging technologies despite their far-reaching potential.” 
(STOA, 2006, p. V) The biotechnology patent debate revealed deep moral concerns 
about basic genetic research that should be taken into consideration by TA. To 
adequately address moral and public concerns, a more contextual approach is needed, 
which integrates various forms of interaction between biotechnology and society 
(Hoedemaekers, 2001). Given the importance of ethics and public consultation and 
engagement, many tools and methodologies have been identiﬁed or developed, and 
put into practice, such as citizens’ forums, consensus conferences, focus groups, 
public hearings, and scenario workshops (see Beekman et al., 2006 for different 
decision-making frameworks and public consultation methods). 
Box 2. Public Perception of GM Food and Crops in China and Worldwide 
The acceptance of GM food and crops by the Chinese public has consistently 
declined over the past decade. In 2000, 83% of Chinese consumers were willing 
to buy nutritionally improved GM food, registering the highest proportion 
among the ten countries surveyed (FAO, 2004). In 2006, the proportion of 
Chinese urban consumers accepting GM food was about 65% (Huang et al., 
2006), and in 2011, 42.1% of the respondents clearly support the promotion of

Challenges of Global Technology Assessment …
165
genetically modiﬁed rice in China (Guangxi et al., 2015). In 2016, 63.2% of 
the respondents opposed the promotion of GM rice in China and only 27.1% 
expressed their support; 74.1% of the respondents were reluctant to eat GM 
food, compared to only 17.8% who were willing. 
An international survey in publics across Europe, the Asia–Paciﬁc region, 
and in the US, Canada, Brazil and Russia ﬁnds that across the globe, a larger 
proportion of the public thinks that GM foods are unsafe to eat than the 
proportion that think that GM foods are safe (Pew Research Center, 2020b). 
Some information on the public perception of HGGE (Box 1) and GM foods and 
crops (Box 2) is presented. Although these only cover a few countries, and much 
more can be said about the public perception of these technologies, the information 
in these boxes shows three things. First, public perceptions differ from country to 
country. Generally, the attitude of Christians, especially those in the West, are more 
cautious toward HGGE than religiously unafﬁliated people, although acceptance of 
HGGE is not uniformly linked with religion. For example, Hindus and Muslims in 
India are equally likely to view research on HGGE as appropriate (Pew Research 
Center, 2020a). The Chinese public, under the inﬂuence of the pragmatist cultural 
tradition, generally show a higher acceptance of new biological technologies. These 
differences are also reﬂected in the way ethics related to such new technologies are 
managed: in China this is driven “top-down” by the government. 
Second, surveys on HGGE broadly show similar patterns: that modifying the 
genetic traits of offspring is controversial, and its acceptance depends on the purpose 
of the application. Preventing serious heritable disorders is regarded as an acceptable 
application more often than human enhancement. However, the outcomes of surveys 
disguise more nuanced considerations that will be useful for political decision-
making. For example, from societal dialog in the Netherlands a set of values were 
derived that need to be protected in policy-making. These are: safety/precaution, 
the prevention of suffering or illness, protection of early human life, respect for 
the autonomy of the future child, autonomy, accessibility, diversity, inclusivity, non-
discrimination, equality and solidarity (Van Baalen et al., 2021). Finally, the declining 
public acceptance of GM foods and crops in China shows that public perception is 
not stable and can change over time (see Box 2), for example, in response to public 
controversies. 
How ethics, values, risks, and beneﬁts are considered and what role they play 
in the public perception of these technologies differs from country to country and 
over time. This is a challenge for the global governance of biotechnology, as public 
perceptions of these technologies have played a major role in the resulting regulations 
in place in different countries. Developing an overarching governance system that 
takes into account the various perspectives across the globe will be a major challenge 
and is possibly not feasible. However, an effort should be made to coordinate the 
different systems of governance in such a way that it allows for variations across 
countries and regions. For this, forms of participatory (pTA) can be employed to

166
S. van Baalen et al.
include a range of (informed) deliberations, perspectives, concerns, and values from 
members of society in the policymaking process (Hennen, 2012). 
5 
Global TA of Biotechnology: The Way Ahead 
The analysis of three key topics in biotechnology shows that a central feature of 
biotechnology is that the science is evolving globally and the products that it brings 
forth are traded across the globe. Yet, there are major differences between the regula-
tion and governance of the academic and industrial sectors between countries. These 
stem from different needs and interests per country, as well as differences in tradi-
tions, cultural differences and public perceptions. To develop an integrated global 
TA framework on biotechnology the following have to be considered. 
International trade 
As we have seen, there are different approaches to risk assessment of GM products 
and emerging biotechnology developments such as gene-edited foods and synthetic 
biology. WTO agreements aim to bring coherence, in order to facilitate international 
trade. For example, the technical barriers to trade (TBT) agreement’s objective was 
developed to ensure that technical regulations, standards, and related assessment 
processes are non-discriminatory, while enabling countries to set suitable standards 
to ensure protection of the environment and human health. Countries are expected to 
have international standards as the basis for regulation and base their risk assessment 
on scientiﬁc evidence. Similarly, the objective of the Agreement on the Applica-
tion of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is to strike a balance 
between the rights of governments to protect food safety, plant and animal health on 
the one hand and these measures becoming unjustiﬁed trade barriers on the other. But 
in practice, this has become a contentious issue. A classic example is the European 
Community’s (EC) Measures Affecting the Approval and Marketing of Biotech Prod-
ucts (Biotech Dispute) case, in which SPS measures pertaining to seven products 
containing genetically modiﬁed organisms were questioned by the US and other 
countries. At the heart of this case was the use of the precautionary principle by 
the EC and disputes over interpreting and implementing “science-based risk assess-
ment”. Although the dispute settlement body of WTO did not agree fully with the 
EC’s arguments in this regard, the case did not bring in any change in the policy and 
practice of the EC on imports of GMOs or in risk assessment. 
Such disputes show that harmonization of standards and consensus on science-
based risk assessment are very difﬁcult to achieve. According to Islam (2019, 16), 
“The SPS Agreement has not yet addressed the weaknesses of its international 
standardizing bodies, the inherent tension between the evolving nature of scien-
tiﬁc research and the conclusiveness of scientiﬁc evidence in assessing risks and the 
implementation difﬁculties faced by developing countries with limited or no scien-
tiﬁc capability”. In short, the SPS agreement, relying on scientiﬁc evidence as a 
conclusive risk assessment criterion, falls short in addressing scientiﬁc uncertainty

surrounding biotech products (ibid). The differences in risk assessment arise on 
account of applying the precautionary principle, setting higher standards in the name 
of protecting human health and environment, and policies on regulation of risk. The 
international standardizing bodies set levels, and when a country considers them to 
be too low, if it thinks that it should set a higher standard it has the option to do so. For 
example, the Appellate Body took the position in the Beef Hormones dispute that the 
CODEX international standard was not mandatory and WTO Members could opt for 
a scientiﬁcally established standard that was higher than that of CODEX. So, in case 
of biotech products, risk assessment, application of the precautionary principle and 
standards are issues. A European consortium has recently analyzed how the precau-
tionary principle is applied in the European Union, how it relates to innovation and 
how its future application can be improved.12 
In addition, the issue with the TRIPS agreement, which is meant to make the 
development and trade of biotech products proﬁtable through patents, is that it mostly 
seems to beneﬁt large companies in richer parts of the world while disadvantaging 
small farmers and local businesses in poorer parts. 
Differences in regulations 
Global governance of biotechnology is likely to be caught between the process-
orientation and precautionary principle of the EU and product-oriented regulation 
by the US. At the same time, many countries follow their own mode of governance 
which differs from both. For example, in crop genome editing, Canada follows an 
approach that is centered on novel traits to regulate. Argentina has developed its 
own approach to crop genome editing (Lema, 2019). Using the deﬁnition of living 
modiﬁed organisms (LMO) in the Cartagena Protocol as the basis, Argentina uses 
the criteria of whether the crop is a GMO or not. According to Lema, “the Argentine 
regulation calls for any crop developed using gene editing to be presented to the 
biosafety commission in order to establish, case by case, if it is GMO or not. This 
determination is mostly based on the changes present in the genome of the plant 
intended to be introduced in the market, i.e., the ﬁnal stage of the breeding process” 
(p. 148). 
The challenges for global governance are many. Should older approaches like 
product-oriented regulation and process-oriented regulation be applied with modi-
ﬁcation, or should genome edited crops be regulated as “‘normal” crops developed 
using traditional plant breeding varieties? Risk assessment is likely to be an issue, 
as treating them as equivalents of crops developed using traditional plant breeding 
varieties without doing assessment for speciﬁc risks will be contested. The scope 
for countries developing sui generis frameworks cannot be ruled out. Differences in 
consumer acceptance, labeling requirements, and co-existence are other issues that 
have implications for global governance.

description of case studies on CRISPR-based gene drives and GMOs can also be found on their

S. van Baalen et al.
Cultural variation and different value-systems between countries 
Regional cultural variations and differences in underlying values of governance 
between countries and regions result in variations in how biotechnologies are valued 
and assessed. This makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne rules and regulations that are acceptable 
to all nations. It also leads to issues such as ethics dumping (Schroeder et al., 2018), 
in which scientists revert to countries with more lenient regulations or less gover-
nance capacity to perform experiments that are not permitted in their own country, 
and moral free-riding, where countries beneﬁt from R&D that is permitted in their 
country for moral reasons. An example of the ﬁrst is the “three parent baby” that 
was born in New York in 2016. Because the method that was used (“spindle nuclear 
transfer”) was not approved in the US, the doctor went to Mexico to perform the 
procedure.13 
Difference in countries’ capacities 
Not all countries have similar capacities in R&D or utilizing biotechnology innova-
tions. Hence, biotechnologies are unevenly adopted across the world, and different 
countries may have adopted different generations of biotechnology. This also leads 
to differences in issues that need to be addressed by governance and regulation. This 
is also a challenge for a globalized TA: As biotechnology has been unevenly adopted 
across countries in terms of applications, research in biotechnology and adoption, 
context-speciﬁc TA may be more relevant than global TA. 
There is not much literature on TA and biotechnology in developing countries, 
as TA is generally weakly institutionalized in developing countries. A case study 
on public engagement with decision-making on Bt Brinjal in India shows the divide 
between scientists who were in favor of approving it for commercial use and, civil 
society groups (amongst others) opposing it (see also Srinivas and Van Est, this 
volume). According to Pandey and Sharma, “As a result, the exercise ended up being 
an exception rather than constituting a norm and the scientiﬁc establishment reverted 
back to mechanisms of communicating the “right” information to the public through 
“proper” channels, so that they can make decisions that follow a techno-economic 
rationality” (Pandey and Sharma, 2020, 164). 
Public engagement 
Other challenges to the global governance of biotechnology are the moral dilemmas 
and public concerns raised by developments in the various ﬁelds. Public engagement 
and social debate are required, but are difﬁcult to organize on a global scale, and it 
is questionable whether or not it is feasible to deﬁne a set of values and principles 
that take into account all existing cultural and social perspectives. TA, especially 
forms of pTA, can be beneﬁcial by analyzing the possible societal impacts, providing 
methods for stakeholder and public participation, and uncovering the national and 
international value-systems that play a role in policymaking (Hahn & Ladikas, 2019). 
But applying pTA globally may turn out to be challenging given the lack of TA in

biotechnology in many countries. National TA institutes can play a role here by 
attuning their public engagement approaches to each other and by attempting to ﬁnd 
shared values underlying public perspectives on biotechnologies. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, as global governance is fragmented with little scope for harmoniza-
tion, global TA of biotechnology can bring clarity, better understanding, and enable 
better governance. In order to do so, an integrated global TA framework should ﬁnd 
ways to address the differences in risk assessment and other relevant regulations 
between countries, often stemming from cultural differences and different under-
lying values. Furthermore, different countries are in different stages of adoption and 
development of biotechnology, focus on different sectors and applications of biotech-
nologies, and have different capacities for R&D and implementation of biotechnolo-
gies or performing TA. Moreover, emergence of new GM food technology, genome 
editing and synthetic biology have complicated matters, as countries approach gover-
nance of these in different ways, with some approaches borrowed from experiences 
in regulating genetic engineering-based biotechnology. These issues will make the 
development of a globalized TA framework and collaboration between TA-institutes 
across countries challenging. 
Addressing these challenges will only be possible if there are country-level and 
regional-level initiatives to ‘re-invent’ a TA of biotechnology. Rather than focusing on 
harmonization of governance, a global TA of biotechnology should focus on assessing 
the impact of developments and decisions in one country to other countries, and clar-
ifying both differences and common grounds between countries, for example when 
it comes to values underlying public perspectives on biotechnology topics or the use 
of the precautionary principle to assess risk and warrant safety. TA institutes across 
the globe can work together to ﬁll the gaps in global governance of biotechnology by 
coordinating their efforts toward national and international governments to ensure 
that developments are acceptable for all, regardless of cultural differences, and help 
make sure that countries are not faced with “faits accomplis” due to globalization 
and rapid developments elsewhere.

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New 
Knowledge and Decision-Making 
Paradigm? 
Lei Huang
and Walter Peissl 
1 
Introduction 
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has been considered as one of the critical technologies 
to address the future grand social challenges in a global context (Kaplan & Haen-
lein, 2020). Major economies are engaging to promote the R&D of AI through 
substantial policy efforts (Margetts & Dorobantu, 2019). Machine learning, neural 
networks, natural language processing (NLP), smart robots, knowledge graphs, and 
expert systems are among the key technical sub-systems that construct the current AI 
technological paradigm (Cresswell et al., 2020; Yablonsky, 2019). However, AI also 
raises concerns with regard to risks for society—from fundamental ethical consid-
erations, through impacts on democracy, to the labor market. These risks and oppor-
tunities call for scientiﬁc policy advice on the basis of interdisciplinary technology 
assessment (TA) activities.

AI is believed to represent an interruptive potential regarding economies and 
societies. The application scenarios of AI are understood to cover many social 
domains (Di Vaio et al., 2020; Fosso Wamba et al., 2021; Perc et al., 2019; 
Popkova & Sergi, 2020), for instance, autonomous driving in transportation, robotic 
surgery in health care. The interaction between machines and humans may evolve 
to a new paradigm that human beings are transforming into data beings (Breazeal 
et al., 2016; Dautenhahn, 2007a, 2007b; Sheridan, 2016). 
Meanwhile, some of research has claimed that AI should be considered as a 
general-purpose technology that generates grand implications in all sectors of the 
economy and society. For instance, deep learning technology will not only create 
market proﬁts for online platforms, but also provides high-efﬁciency tools for social 
governance. In addition, with the accumulation of applications in speciﬁc economic 
and ﬁnancial domains, AI technology presents the potential to change social struc-
tures (Klinger et al., 2018; Rasskazov, 2020). Hence, to achieve a better understanding 
of the potential impacts and necessary governance, we aim to identify the critical 
research topic of AI from a TA perspective. 
In this chapter, we sketch a picture of global developments in AI and discuss 
potential ﬁelds of application as well as the demand for TA. In order to do so, in 
Sect. 2, we provide a short overview of historical developments of AI, and identify 
stakeholders involved in current AI R&D. In Sect. 3, we describe major activities 
in the international policy arena. Section 4 is devoted to TA activities with regard 
to AI in Europe and beyond. In Sect. 5, we conclude with the demand for future 
cooperation in global TA on the issues at stake.

The Identiﬁcation of Stakeholders in a Data-Driven 
Artiﬁcial Intelligence Context 
AI is a rapidly growing domain based on developments since the 1950s (Fosso Wamba 
et al., 2021). In 1950, Alan Turing offered the preliminary concept of “thinking 
machines” on the level of human beings (Turing, 2007). Based on the level of devel-
opment, there are three types of AI: artiﬁcial narrow intelligence (ANI), artiﬁcial 
general intelligence (AGI), and artiﬁcial super intelligence (ASI) (Lorica & Loukides, 
2016). ANI is also termed “Weak AI”, due to the limited information processing capa-
bility of speciﬁc tasks (Yadav et al., 2017). AGI or “Strong AI” refers to machines 
which can perform on the level of the human mind, performing a general level of 
intellectual tasks (Roitblat, 2020; Wang & Goertzel, 2012). ASI refers to the cogni-
tive performance of machines that will surpass that of human beings (Narain et al., 
2019). Actual AI systems refer to the “Weak AI” level so far. 
Although some academic deﬁnitions have been made, there is no universal deﬁni-
tion for AI (Helm et al., 2020; Legg & Hutter, 2007). Due to rapid development in this 
domain, the deﬁnition of AI is continuously changing. According to the EU AI watch 
report, Deﬁning Artiﬁcial Intelligence 2.0: toward an operational deﬁnition and

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New Knowledge …
177
taxonomy of artiﬁcial intelligence, the deﬁnition from the High-Level Expert Group 
on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (HLEG) has been considered as an operational deﬁnition 
of AI, as follows (European Commission. Joint Research 2020): 
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems 
designed by humans that given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by 
perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected struc-
tured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, 
derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal. 
AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt 
their behavior by analyzing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. 
According to this operational deﬁnition, AI is a certain kind of information system 
for processing data to achieve the given goal of making the machine think or act 
like human beings (Russell & Norvig, 2009). Hence, for information systems, a 
“stakeholder” means “participants [being individuals, groups or organizations who 
take part in a system development process] … whose actions can inﬂuence or be 
inﬂuenced by the development and use of the system whether directly or indirectly.” 
(Pouloudi & Whitley, 1997). 
The deﬁnition of AI has evolved since Turing’s research on machine thinking. The 
core of the deﬁnition of AI is to make the machine think and act like a human being, 
as far as possible. The technological system of AI is a complex system. However, 
the basic logic of AI deﬁnitions is that machines need to learn from data, which is 
provided by humans via information exchange. Based on the current technological 
nature of AI systems, information exchange works in a digital format, which is called 
“Data” (Al-Jarrah et al., 2015). To achieve this goal, scientists have been developing 
relevant sub-technological systems that include hardware, algorithms, and human– 
machine communication interfaces (Shin et al., 2016). For instance, computational 
capability has increased 300,000 times from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaGo Zero (2017). 
More powerful computational capability means more efﬁcient data processing for 
AI development (Al-Jarrah et al., 2015; Jordan & Mitchell, 2015). 
Although the current AI ecosystem is still far from Strong AI, it has presented 
great potential for digital society and the economy (Mahadevan, 2018). Most of 
the current AI-relevant policies highlight the importance of data resources for AI 
development (as shown in Sect. 3, ‘The international policy discussion’). Data-driven 
technologies and application scenarios are contributing to the training of algorithms, 
machine learning devices, and human-AI feedback systems. For instance, a large 
scale of graphic data has been applied to train the visual recognition algorithm (Lu 
et al., 2018). Data-driven technological progress presents one of the most critical 
differences between the AI technology from Turing’s era and current AI (Chen et al., 
2019). In addition, data-driven AI is not only a technological challenge but also a 
grand social challenge (Alyoshina, 2019). Most of the data resources which are used 
for AI development come from human societies. 
Hence, the stakeholders of AI are those participants that can inﬂuence or be inﬂu-
enced by the development and use of AI systems, directly or indirectly. Furthermore, 
based on the HLEG operational deﬁnition of AI, data processing is the essential

178
L. Huang and W. Peissl
characteristic for current AI systems. The stakeholders of current AI system develop-
ment participate in data processing either directly or indirectly. However, according 
to the HLEG deﬁnition, the data processing capability must achieve the speciﬁc 
purpose that makes AI systems gain the function of decision-making by adapting 
their behavior to interact with the real world. Based on this speciﬁc purpose, the 
stakeholders of AI will also be involved in the intersystem behavioral interaction of 
AI systems. AI systems are evolutional systems based on data-driven information and 
communication technology (ICT) systems. All of the stakeholders in an AI system 
participate—on different levels and with different impact—in the construction of the 
ecosystem that includes technology innovation, application scenarios, and human-AI 
interaction interfaces (Dayton, 2020; Samoili et al., 2020). 
AI is now generating value for different kinds of stakeholders involved in the 
technology systems development and use. A multi-stakeholder perspective on AI 
also considers the beneﬁts, which are related to the value-creation process, for both 
industry and society (Güngör, 2020). Consequently, in line with the comprehensive 
review of the HLEG operational deﬁnition and the value-creation of AI, participating 
multi-stakeholders directly or indirectly process data from technology, industry and 
society, in order to develop the AI system. 
The current developments of an AI deﬁnition show a signiﬁcant feature of data-
driven innovation. Hence, basic research and technology applications of AI strongly 
rely on the allocation of data resources from the R&D of technologies, economies, 
and societies. In addition, more stakeholders should be involved in AI development 
in terms of variant contribution of data resources and values represented by these 
data. We intend to illustrate the data-driven characteristics of AI development for 
further discussion in the TA domain. 
AI systems and technology development 
AI systems are complex systems that are built by subsystems of technology. For 
instance, machine learning, expert systems, smart robots, knowledge graphs, and 
natural language processing. At the current stage of development, those subsystems 
are designed and built on one of the most important principles: to process a large 
scale of data resource with effective and economical methods to achieve knowl-
edge exchange between the AI system and the physical world (Duan et al., 2019; 
Eisenstein, 2019; Gu et al., 2018; Hassanien & Darwish, 2021; Kusiak, 2017). 
AI system and industrial development 
AI systems have been widely applied in the industrial domain. For example, 
in business intelligence analytics, autonomous driving, and intelligent manufac-
turing. Combined with speciﬁc algorithms, current data-driven business intelligence 
analytics gain more potential capability to process a large scale of data from multi-
stakeholders from the market (Corea, 2019). Data-driven AI systems will offer a more 
stable autonomous driving system based on the R&D of semi-autonomous vehicles 
(Huang et al., 2019). For intelligent manufacturing, data-driven technologies have 
been considered as the fundamental layer of the entire system (Feng et al., 2020).

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New Knowledge …
179
AI systems and societal development 
AI systems are merging with societal systems (Garcia et al., 2020). Society offers a 
large scale of data resources for the development of AI systems (Rohlﬁng et al., 2020). 
At the same time, AI systems have the potential to change the entire social structure 
(Fosso Wamba et al., 2021). Decision systems based on AI have been applied in 
the domain of health and social care with a large scale of data-driven technology or 
application (Cresswell et al., 2020). AI has been widely used in the development of 
data-driven education since the millennium (Baldominos & Quintana, 2019; Guan 
et al., 2020). Data-driven algorithms have been adopted for research regarding social 
welfare improvement, e.g., improving refugee integration, incident management and 
pandemic control (Bansak et al., 2018; Elvas et al., 2020; Esposito et al., 2021). 
Furthermore, artiﬁcial intelligence assistive technologies have been widely applied 
in communication, politics and marketing (Margetts & Dorobantu, 2019; Van Esch 
et al., 2019). AI systems have also been implemented in many private and public secu-
rity applications, such as biometrics, predictive policing and predictive recidivism 
algorithms in the judicial system. However, all of these bear a tremendous potential 
for surveillance and are prone to biases (Dressel & Farid, 2018; NIST,  2019; O’Neil, 
2016).

The International Policy Discussion 
Policy discussions are a crucial component of research related to TA. According 
to this perspective, we developed a comparative analysis of AI policies in global 
contexts. We operated a comparative policy content analysis of AI policies across 
two dimensions: a country comparison and an application area comparison. 
For this chapter, we analyzed national-level AI policy documents, strategies and 
plans. The policy analysis covered major economies and societies and include agri-
culture, taxation, transportation, education, and science etc. The current policy debate 
on AI has attracted widespread attention worldwide. Many international organiza-
tions and institutes have constructed databases of policy research. For example, the 
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) constructed the AI policy 
initiatives (2016–2020) database at European Union level for the research project “AI, 
Big Data, and Fundamental Rights”.1 However, in order to develop a more compre-
hensive and integrated comparative analysis of AI policies in a global context, we 
adopted the OECD.AI Policy Observatory Database (OECD.AI) as the main source 
using more detailed sample data. This database contains more than 600 policy entries 
from major sectors, and gives an overview from different perspectives and sources— 
from statistics and national strategies, to assessment reports on economic and societal 
implications.

We analyzed these sources with regard to speciﬁc domains of AI impact, and 
in relation to countries and geopolitically relevant regions. We adopted the policy 
document content analysis methodology to operate the comparison and conclusion 
of the current pilot policy practices. We also adopted Pandas as the data cleaning 
package in Python to remove duplicated policy data. 
3.1 
Different Discourses in Different Regions 
According to the OECD.AI, more than 60 countries have already released a national-
level initiative, policy or strategy of AI development. After removing duplicates in the 
OECD.AI Policy Document Dataset, there are 576 remaining documents. In terms of 
the yearly budget range, there are 14 documents (2%) marked as “More than 500 M 
(million in USD)”, 13 documents (2%) marked as “100–500 M” and 154 documents 
(27%) marked as “Not applicable”. 
The USA, China, the EU,2 and the UK are the AI-advanced majorities in terms of 
the amount of scientiﬁc publications on AI from 20 areas, including economy, digital 
economy, transport, health, industry and education. In the policymaking domain, the 
USA released 47 national-level documents of AI policy, initiative and strategy. The 
EU released 44 policy documents. The UK released 39 national-level documents. 
USA 
The USA has constructed a comprehensive policy framework of AI development. In 
2016, the USA released three important policy reports, including Preparing for the 
Future of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, National Artiﬁcial Intelligence R&D Strategic Plan, 
and Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy3 by the National Science 
and Technology Council (NSTC). The three reports clariﬁed the purposes of and 
targets for USA AI development. In February 2019, the former US president Trump 
addressed the Executive Order 13859: Maintaining American Leadership in Artiﬁ-
cial Intelligence.4 This document emphasized the importance of USA leadership in 
the domain of AI, with applications in the areas of economy, society, security, and 
the military. The USA did not release any document that directly mention a yearly 
budget above 500 million (USD) held within the OECD.AI database. However, two 
documents from the USA have the yearly budget range of “100–500 M”. One is

mance of AI R&D in the domain of security and military. The other document was 
released by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NSF AI Research Institutes;6 it 
is a national AI research institutes program to promote longer-term R&D to maintain 
U.S. leadership in AI. 
EU 
According to the analysis of the policy documents in the OECD.AI database, EU 
AI policies have focused on the upgrade by AI applications in various areas which 
include industry, manufacturing, health, and energy. The EU has promoted the coop-
eration of R&D in the AI domain by releasing policies and member state-level plans, 
setting up research funding, and building up a laboratory. For instance, to emphasize 
willingness to cooperate on AI, the EU released the Coordinated Plan on Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence7 in 2018. Furthermore, EU AI policy has underlined the research of 
ethics and humanity. In March 2020, the EU released a white paper, On Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence—A European approach to excellence and trust,8 to declare the solution 
of information transparency in AI development, data security, privacy protection 
and the regulatory framework. In April 2021, the European Commission released a 
Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonized rules on artiﬁcial intelligence,9 
which is the ﬁrst legal framework for AI.10 In addition, the EU has also emphasized 
speciﬁc areas to promote AI applications based on the niches with EU advantages. In 
2017, the EU released The Report of the High-Level Group on the Competitiveness 
and Sustainable Growth of the Automotive Industry in the European Union (GEAR 
2030)11 to enhance AI applications in the automobile industry. 
UK 
Aiming to become one of the most important AI innovation centers, the UK has also 
released a series of national-level strategies and plans to promote AI development. In 
2017, the UK published the Industrial Strategy: Building a Britain ﬁt for the Future 
(White Paper)12 to set out the government’s plan to create an economy to promote AI 
application that ﬁts the national industry strategy. In January 2018, the UK released

AI development; the UK government also emphasized the relationship between AI 
and the digital economy in this document. Also in 2018, the UK set up an Ofﬁce for 
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (OAI)14 to enhance cooperation between different government 
departments, ministries, and multi-stakeholders in the domain of AI. 
China 
In the OECD.AI policy database, there are only eight documents regarding China’s 
AI development. However, these policy documents cover the most important areas, 
including the national plan, industry guidelines, laboratory construction, and the 
education plan for current AI application and development in China. In 2017, The 
State Council for the People’s Republic of China released the National New Gener-
ation AI Plan (新一代人工智能发展规划) 15 which has been considered as the 
cornerstone policy for China’s future AI development and application. This national 
level plan involved a comprehensive policy framework for China’s AI develop-
ment initiatives and goals in speciﬁc domains that cover R&D, industrialization, 
talent development, education and skills acquisition, standard-setting and regula-
tions, ethical norms, and security. In addition, China’s Ministry of Science and Tech-
nology (MOST) released the Governance Principles for New Generation AI- Devel-
oping Responsible AI (新一代人工智能治理原则——发展负责任的人工智能).16 
This initiative highlights that China is emphasizing responsible AI development 
with the eight principles of harmony, friendliness, fairness, inclusiveness, respect for 
privacy, security and controllability, shared responsibility, open collaboration, and 
agile governance. 
Other East Asian countries 
Japan and South Korea have also presented an active policy attitude to AI develop-
ment. In 2019, Japan released the national-level AI Strategy (AI戦略)17 to clarify 
that the motivation of AI development should respond to the critical social chal-
lenges, including the aging society and sub-replacement fertility. In December 2019, 
South Korea released the National Strategy for Artiﬁcial Intelligence (인공지능 국 
가전략)18 with the yearly budget range “More than 500 M”. In this policy docu-
ment, South Korea not only emphasized global digital competitiveness by 2030, but 
also declared to create 455 trillion Korean Won (approx. 405 billion US dollars) of

economic surplus and to enhance the living standard for the entire society through 
AI development.19 
South America and Africa 
Meanwhile, South America and Africa are still on the lower level of AI develop-
ment in terms of the comprehensive comparison of scientiﬁc publications and policy 
performance. Six South American countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, 
Peru, and Uruguay have already released national-level AI-related policies. In 2019, 
Brazil presented the Brazilian Artiﬁcial Intelligence Strategy (Public Consultation) 
(Consulta Pública da Estratégia Brasileira de Inteligência Artiﬁcial).20 This strategy 
document declared AI development implications on the economy, ethics, develop-
ment, education, and jobs. However, most of these South American policy documents 
are still directly related to the digital transformations and data governance. 
In Africa, there were only four countries, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and South 
Africa, that released national-level AI-related policy, initiative or strategy documents. 
In those policy documents, similarly to South American countries, AI policy content 
was only mentioned in relation to digital development and data governance. 
International policy conclusion 
According to this comparative review of countries and regions, AI policy practices 
show the characteristics of diversity in a global context. Major economies have devel-
oped AI policies with a strong focus on their own economic, social, and technolog-
ical development characteristics. For instance, policies from the USA presented the 
demand of maintaining leadership in every AI application area. AI polices from the 
EU placed more emphasis on governance of ethics and humanity. China’s national 
AI plans strike a balance between promoting the development of speciﬁc application 
areas of AI and comprehensiveness. To promote economic and societal development 
is the most important policy target for all AI policy practices. 
3.2 
Areas of Application 
According to the OECD.AI Policy Observatory Database (OCED.AI), 20 policy 
areas are related to AI application. Within these 20 policy areas, the economy and 
the digital economy are the most signiﬁcant domains in terms of publications. The 
OECD.AI policy areas cover the major ﬁelds of economy and society, and include 
environment, health, agriculture, transportation, science and technology, and social 
and welfare issues.

L. Huang and W. Peissl
Based on the statistical analysis of policy documents and scientiﬁc publications 
within OCED. AI, the AI & economy area is the most signiﬁcant domain of AI policy. 
Most of the AI policy documents involve economic development and boost. In the 
area of AI & economy, policy research and documents concern AI application in new 
business models, data analysis, information systems and management performance. 
The application of AI has a potentially tremendous implication on the economy 
(Pratt, 2015). Data has been considered as a critical resource for the market, and 
AI technology will enhance the performance of data resources (Mirowski, 2007). 
However, there is the possibility that potential beneﬁts in efﬁciency and proﬁtability 
go hand-in-hand with a great deal of automatization, which may replace a large part 
of the workforce and may lead to unemployment, poverty, and fundamental structural 
changes.21 
Hence, the digital economy is also one of the most active AI application domains. 
Further advancement of AI has augmented the digital economy with signiﬁcant 
implications for the speciﬁc policy domains (Watanabe et al., 2018). The AI & digital 
economy area covers multiple applications that include data governance, digital secu-
rity, privacy protection, and communication networks. Based on the sharing of data 
resources, AI development could create more application scenarios for the disruptive 
knowledge creation mode for the digital economy (Holford, 2019; OECD, 2020). 
AI development is also generating more application scenarios within speciﬁc 
economic areas that include ﬁnance, industry, entrepreneurship, investment, and 
employment. In the area of ﬁnance and insurance, governments have already noticed 
that the application of AI enhances ﬁnancial data processing efﬁciency in terms of 
the dynamic market status-quo and risk assessment (Bahrammirzaee, 2010; Heaton 
et al., 2017; Palmie et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). In the area of industry 
and entrepreneurship, the application of AI is currently accelerating the process 
of digitalization with emerging business models (Garbuio & Lin, 2019). In addi-
tion, AI may substantially affect the investment environment by the application 
of the self-improving AI system (Hall, 2007; OECD, 2021). AI-driven industry 
and entrepreneurship will also signiﬁcantly change the labor force structure and 
the employment environment. The automation systems of AI will replace more 
employed people (Zhou et al., 2020a, 2020b). Hence, the AI-driven employment 
environment may need massive evolution in the current education system with higher 
skills teaching and learning (Roll & Wylie, 2016). 
Currently, the autonomous vehicle is one of the most important AI applications 
in the mobility area (Stead & Vaddadi, 2019). The autonomous vehicle has been 
considered as the biggest transition of mobility (Lˇazˇaroiu et al., 2020). However, the 
autonomous driving system is by no means an independent technological system, it is 
rather a complex system that merges with the social and economic system (Kassens-
Noor et al., 2020). For instance, besides the high efﬁciency sensor data transmission 
support system, the autonomous driving system relies on updated trafﬁc regulations 
and new public infrastructure construction (Huang et al., 2019; Raiyn, 2018). Further-
more, the cost and potential environmental beneﬁts will also be essential dynamics

of the development of the autonomous vehicle (Noruzoliaee et al., 2018; Vosooghi 
et al., 2020). 
In healthcare, AI application enhances the performance of diagnosing disease and 
health risk assessment (Waring et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a, 2020b). AI systems 
can process a large scale of personal data to facilitate personalized healthcare and 
precision treatments and medicine (Ali et al., 2021), for instance, improving patient 
care with precision medicine and mobile health, high-performance management of 
health systems, better understanding public health, and facilitating health research 
and innovation. (Abdel-Basset et al., 2021). With the large scale of data resource inte-
gration from different areas, AI may generate more health care application scenarios 
(Dwivedi et al., 2021; Price & Cohen, 2019). 
In terms of the comparative study, we found that current AI policies promote 
AI as a fundamental technological ecosystem in every application area. AI policies 
from different application areas all mentioned the importance of data resources for 
the development of AI technology. At the current stage, AI technological ecosystem 
and application scenarios are highly dependent on the integration and utilization of 
various data resources. The development of AI is showing strong characteristics of a 
data-driven innovation. This crucial dependency on data for training issues as well as 
for actual performance of its function leads directly to the discussion of the potential 
risks of widespread AI application. In the following Sect. 4, we will look more closely 
at AI-related TA activities in Europe and beyond, and ﬁnally will uncover the most 
striking issues discussed with regard to the societal implications of AI.

TA Activities in the Field so far and Options 
for the Future 
4.1 
Analysis of EPTA-Activities 
The policy documents discussed above provide an overview of diverse national AI 
policies, mainly with regard to promoting AI as a key factor for future economic (and 
societal) development. This section analyses studies and ﬁndings from TA institutions 
around the world. The main focus here lies on the—often unintended—societal and 
ethical issues. 
To date, most institutionalized TA activities are located within Europe and the 
USA. However, there is increasing interest around the world in TA and TA-like 
activities. EPTA is a network of organizations doing TA within or for their respec-
tive parliaments at a regional, national or European level. Since the U.S. Govern-
ment Accountability Ofﬁce (GAO) became an associate member in 2002, EPTA 
has extended beyond Europe and currently comprises 23 parliamentary TA (PTA) 
institutes. This process of global networking between PTA institutions now includes 
Chile, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea (Peissl & Grünwald, 2021). EPTA provides

186
L. Huang and W. Peissl
a joint website22 which is based on a database of TA projects, reports, policy briefs 
and news. We undertook a title and abstract search for the period 2008–2021 using 
the search strings “AI, machine learning, algorithm, robot, social media, and democ-
racy”. Based on the results we identiﬁed 173 entries; 73 projects, 39 reports and 
61 policy briefs.23 Cleaning the dataset by removing duplicates, including news and 
policy briefs for projects where a report was also available, we ended up with 80 
entries for analysis. 
The data show that PTA institutions have been aware of upcoming technology 
and related questions since 2008. The abstracts of these 80 entries were analyzed 
and clustered depending on the respective primary focus of the report or project. 
These PTA activities were mostly associated with AI (35) and robotics (13) in 
general. Together with digitalization (6), autonomous systems (5), algorithmic deci-
sion systems (7), and algorithms (3), this covers 69 of the 80 entries. The remainder 
address emerging technologies (3), labor (2), democracy, social media, surveillance, 
5G, quantum technology, and ﬁnancial technologies. 
In a second step we found a set of keywords associated with areas of research. 
These show the characteristics of (P)TA studies: they are often interested in the 
general overview (25) of a development and try to ﬁgure out impact in several dimen-
sions. The second domain of interest was the labour-market and implications for the 
workforce (12), third is the aspect of democracy (9), followed by ethics and health-
care (6 each). The legal framework for AI (4) and mobility and education (3 each) 
bring the total keyword analysis to 68 out of the 80 included entries. The other 12 deal 
with sustainability, the pandemic and space (2 each) and speciﬁc themes like surveil-
lance, robot maintenance, quantum computing, precision farming, drug production, 
and consumer protection. 
4.2 
Main Areas of Discussion 
In this section we will discuss some of the main areas of research on AI and society 
undertaken by PTA institutions. As already mentioned, there is a lively discussion 
about the effects of AI, automation, robots, and digitalization in general on the 
labor market. An overview of the different approaches in EPTA-member countries is 
given in the EPTA report of 2016 (EPTA, 2016). Unfortunately, a sharp distinction 
between the different domains is not possible, therefore the different areas are exam-
ined together. This is not problematic for our context, as AI can be seen as a basic 
technology for robots, automation, and digitalization of jobs beyond the production 
line. 
The debate was triggered by a study by Frey and Osborne (2013), which showed 
that about 47% of all jobs in the USA were at high risk of being computerized within 
approximately 20 years. The main objection raised against this study’s ﬁndings was

its historical analogy, which claims that all technological advances in history have 
also led to an increase in new (other) jobs. This argument, however, ignores the fact 
that economic conditions were different in earlier periods (Cas & Krieger-Lamina, 
2020). With digitalization, we are facing completely new challenges, with ICT and 
AI ﬂooding all areas of life, not only the production and service sectors. 
The 2013 study has also been criticized for its methodological approach, but has 
been repeated in different contexts. An overview is given in Cas and Krieger-Lamina 
(2020), based on Lovergine and Pellero (2018). Although the high number of affected 
jobs was not replicated in other studies, the mere fact that the potential impact could 
be so large has led to discussions of the future labor market and unemployment. This 
attention may lead to less of an impact being seen in the future, as when we address 
the future, it is usually the beginning of shaping that very future. 
The same applies to the area of social media platforms and their impact on societal 
communication, polarization and democracy. An EPTA-report provides an overview 
of different approaches to tackle the theme of “digital democracy” by EPTA-member 
States (EPTA, 2018). The digitalization of communication in the form of the internet 
originally gave rise to the hope that it would make democratization and broader partic-
ipation possible. However, the developments of the last few years in the ﬁeld of social 
media show that, in contrast, democratic structures and processes can be endangered. 
AI is not an insigniﬁcant contributor to this. The algorithms used by online platforms 
lead to a reinforcement of extreme positions and thus enable polarization in the spec-
trum of opinions, which makes constructive discourse more difﬁcult. As shown by the 
examples of both campaigns in 2016 for the election of President Trump in the US and 
the Brexit vote in the UK micro-targeting on social media can be used to speciﬁcally 
approach voters and provide them with very different targeted content. In this way, 
general awareness-raising and fair information, by for example traditional media, 
are counteracted, and inﬂuence is exerted on these elections. Furthermore, there is a 
danger that these digital tools and infrastructure can be attacked and misused from 
the outside. This means that central elements of the political sovereignty of states 
can be undermined. 
The relationship between new communication possibilities and AI-driven social 
media and democracy and the rule of law is of particular importance. TA-institutions 
at the European Parliament, in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and 
the USA have conducted speciﬁc studies on this (Bieri et al., 2021; EPTA,  2018; 
GAO, 2020; Kind et al., 2017; Kolleck & Orwat, 2020; Marsden & Meyer, 2019; 
Neudert & Marchal, 2019; Tennøe & Barland, 2019; Van Est & Kool, 2017). Almost 
all other studies by EPTA members dealing with the effects of the widespread use 
of AI also address this fundamental challenge. 
4.3 
Responsibility, Transparency and Ethics 
In more than a quarter of the analyzed TA-studies from EPTA members we can ﬁnd 
basic issues like responsibility, transparency or ethics included in the abstract. These

188
L. Huang and W. Peissl
issues are also discussed in the broader existing literature on AI and societal impact. 
It clearly shows that the most striking issue besides the direct effects on the labor 
market/workforce and communication and democracy are the more fundamental 
issues of responsibility, transparency and ethics. AI applications are intended to 
widely support decision-making or, even more riskily, autonomously decide upon 
certain actions. Processes triggered by AI systems may have impact on individuals 
or groups, their chances of societal participation, or even their very existence. So, it 
is fair to ask, who should be responsible for these decisions? In order to be able to 
locate problems or failures in algorithms, or other parts of the algorithmic decision-
making systems (ADM), there is a need for transparency with regard to their internal 
mechanisms and the context of application. 
Therefore, here we will present some lines of argumentation in depth. A promi-
nent example of AI is its use in speech recognition and language processing. As the 
core element of digital assistants such as Smart Speakers like Alexa, Google Assis-
tant or Siri, AI has found its way into many households and smartphones. There-
fore, machines or systems have found their way into our households (and to some 
extent also to public ofﬁces) where they can not only comprehensively monitor our 
behaviour, but also inﬂuence it, from the way we communicate with machines, to how 
we communicate with each other, and how we move around our own homes. Since it 
is foreseeable that in the future, voice commands and thus digital speech recognition 
and language processing will be used in other areas (from cars, to systems’ control 
in ofﬁces, and manufacturing), some fundamental questions arise: What is AI, what 
can it do and where are the limits to its application, if there should be any at all? 
What ethical principles guide considerations about what we want machines to do in 
the future, and what we don’t? 
For an ethical discussion, here we focus on an aspect of these deﬁnitions that 
comes from earlier approaches to AI. What does “artiﬁcial intelligence” mean? This 
is all the more difﬁcult because there is no comprehensive, conclusive deﬁnition 
of “intelligence”. For technical developments, the ISO established a deﬁnition for 
“artiﬁcial intelligence” in 2015. In this understanding, AI is the “capability of a func-
tional unit to perform functions that are generally associated with human intelligence 
such as reasoning and learning.” (ISO/IEC JTC 1, 2015). However, “reasoning” and 
“learning” fall short of describing human intelligence comprehensively. In any case, 
AI research and development is trying to teach machines behavior that is modelled 
on, and as close as possible to, human behavior and decision-making processes. A 
distinction is usually made between weak and strong AI. In weak AI, algorithms solve 
individual, speciﬁc tasks, but do so quickly and, depending on the subject matter, 
to a very high quality. Examples include analyzing large amounts of data, pattern 
recognition, and predictions based on recognized patterns. Strong AI, on the other 
hand, describes a state where machines should have comparable intellectual skills 
to humans, and ultimately have consciousness similar to humans. However, this is 
primarily a visionary philosophical concept whose realization is widely doubted for 
the foreseeable future (Apt & Priesack, 2019). The discussions about a “superin-
telligence” which could ultimately prove superior to human intelligence and even

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New Knowledge …
189
dominate humans, also fall into this area. Although this is a controversial topic, it is 
more likely to belong to the realm of science ﬁction. 
From today’s perspective, all available AI systems belong to the “weak AI” cate-
gory. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages/abilities, they also have some 
fundamental deﬁcits. These include a low capacity for abstraction, especially in the 
transfer of experience and learned knowledge to other contexts, high requirements 
for the pre-structuring of data, information and environments, and a lack of under-
standing and reasoning in the empathic sense. Even Alpha Go Zero, one of the most 
elaborate AI systems, is not able to do so. As a result, AI systems lack experience, 
tacit knowledge, judgment, empathy, and courtesy, as well as social learning and 
emotions that characterize humans and human intelligence. Or as Zweig (2019) puts 
it “an algorithm has no tact”. 
AI systems are designed to make more or less “autonomous” decisions based 
on available data and predetermined algorithms. When consequences for people or 
things result from these decisions, the question of responsibility arises. This usually 
becomes relevant in the case of negative consequences. So, who bears responsibility 
for the decisions made by AI systems? The systems themselves currently have no 
legal personality. However, responsibility is not only borne for negative damaging 
events. Responsibility is also derived to a certain degree from knowledge and compe-
tence. Therefore, one could also assume responsibility of such systems (which do not 
exist) for positive events. For example, what happens when a digital assistant hears 
someone calling for help, when children say they are being beaten, etc.? (Vlahos, 
2019). Should a digital assistant then be required to call for help, or report assumed 
crimes? To this end, it is possible to discuss the question of when a certain type of 
reaction appears to be called for. This can be solved relatively easily by analogy with 
comparable situations involving humans. Appropriate behavior would then have to 
be programmed into the AI’s algorithms. Much more fundamental, however, is the 
question of how a digital assistant comes to know about such situations in the ﬁrst 
place. If it has been activated by one of the persons concerned, the system will listen 
in a permissible manner. However, since it could be argued that the digital assistants 
could be helpful in an emergency (sound the alarm), it would be conceivable to argue 
for their permanent activity. Here, however, an ethical conﬂict arises that points to 
the fundamental discussion of the security which can be brought by surveillance, 
and the cost of that security, in terms of, for example, loss of privacy. The decision 
is very much context-bound: under particularly threatening circumstances, such as 
in a hospital intensive care unit, we would like to be comprehensively monitored. 
But what about in everyday life? Do we want to be bugged everywhere so that we 
can potentially get assistance at some unknown point in an emergency (which will 
not necessarily occur)? How much "insecurity" can we humans stand, how much is 
reasonable for us, and how much security can actually be generated by additional 
surveillance? 
AI systems are already integrated into many aspects of everyday life. They are 
interaction partners and also ﬁlters. Streaming services (Netﬂix, Spotify, etc.), Face-
book, or even digital assistant providers such as Amazon and Google contain a large 
scale of personal data resources that can be applied to precise user portrait purposes

190

(Taffel, 2021); this means that they already know more about our personal preferences 
than our closest friends. Algorithms reinforce our purchasing decisions and solidify 
preferences. They thus determine the preferences of their users. In response to criti-
cism of this, algorithms have been proposed which will make alternative suggestions 
in order to strengthen the sovereignty of users. But, this does not solve the problem, 
rather the opposite: they have an even more manipulative effect because they suggest 
an apparently objectiﬁed determination of preferences. But the result is the same in 
that the sovereignty of the user is—intentionally or not—drastically reduced (Stubbe 
et al., 2019). 
Another problem in human interaction with AI (Amershi, 2019; Cai,  2019) arises 
from the attempts which are being made to make the systems as close as possible to 
the human way of communicating. However, no AI has yet passed the Turing test 
(Turing, 1950). Problematically, there is a strategic aspect of communication hidden 
in many applications of AI. That is, the systems try to feign a human counterpart in 
order to gain trust—which machines do not have a priori. However, this is not the same 
as two people talking to each other. Openness and transparency are important for the 
sovereignty of humans in interaction. Digital assistants have a similar effect, often 
docilely simulating an emotionless exchange with little controversy. Communication 
here loses its ambivalence, which humans know how to deal with through social 
experience, and through which we ﬁnd out how we appear to others, and who we 
are to the other person. From an ethical perspective, this kind of communication 
with AI, which simulates a supposedly cooperative social interaction, whilst behind 
the scenes it pursues strategic purposes, is highly questionable (Stubbe et al., 2019). 
Current developments attempt to intentionally “enhance” the perfection of computers 
with human ﬂaws and weaknesses. Unlike classic robot voices, Google Duplex, for 
example, inserts irregularities into sentences. Thus, apparent pauses for thought can 
be heard, or a “Mhmm” muttered now and then, together with abrupt pauses in speech. 
This gives the impression that the AI is responding to the conversation partner, or 
thinking (Kremp, 2018). Duplex was supposed to be integrated into Google Assistant 
on a test basis in 2018 (Herbig, 2018) and is now active in 49 states of the US and 
some other countries like Australia, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand and the 
UK (Callaham, 2021). Even if these applications currently only work in limited 
contexts and are trained for speciﬁc situations (hairdresser appointments, restaurant 
reservations), it nevertheless points to a fundamental ethical problem: users must be 
aware and able to know when communication with a machine is taking place. 
A very different dimension of an AI application in communication is the 
MOODBOX smart speaker, introduced in 2016. It is primarily used to play music, 
but has built-in AI—called EMI—via the MOODBOX that is supposed to be able to 
detect the emotional status of the user from their utterances. The smart speaker checks 
how the owner is feeling and plays music to match the emotional state (Gineersnow, 
2016). In this technology, of course, there is also great potential for the marketing of 
other goods and services, whose marketing/advertising is tuned to be easier to sell 
in certain psychological states.

With regard to emotion detection, we face some fundamental issues in AI and 
biometrics. The range of applications already include automated analyses of indi-
vidual behavior patterns, such as a person’s individual way of walking, as well as 
facial and emotion recognition, which are particularly controversial due to the enor-
mous social risks. Emotion recognition is not only used in the advertising industry, 
but also to some extent in job interviews, in call centers and also in robotics/AI devel-
opment (Masoner, 2020) (e.g. in the ﬁeld of autonomous vehicles or for human–robot 
interactions). Toyota’s new Concept-i series of automobiles is said to use AI systems 
and application of biometrics to recognize the driver’s emotions by analyzing facial 
expressions and tone of voice. Thus, if the system (the A. I. Agent Yui) detects that 
the driver is stressed, it shall switch to autonomous driving mode (“Mobility Team-
mate Concept”). Alternatively, if the system registers signs of decreased alertness, 
the driver’s sense of sight, touch and smell should be able to be stimulated to put 
the driver in a more alert state. In this way, the driver’s stress level can be increased 
by smells, etc., but can also be reduced vice versa. The system is also designed to 
access a range of data from social media platforms, as well as activity and conversa-
tion content, in order to identify the user’s preferences (Cheng, 2017). Furthermore, 
Toyota has announced that it has entered into a partnership with Microsoft, as have 
a number of other manufacturers in the automotive sector (Dudley, 2016). Emotion 
recognition is also controversial in AI research itself, both in terms of scientiﬁcity and 
meaningfulness, and a number of experts are calling for bans on emotion recognition 
(Honey & Stieler, 2020). 
Machine ethics and ethics for AI 
Machine ethics has been discussed frequently. It deals with rules in the ﬁeld of AI 
and robotics. A distinction must be made here between ethical rules for AI systems 
and robots, and the so-called ethics of machines, or machine morality. The moral 
machine, which gives itself rules and then acts according to them, will only become 
relevant with the implementation of so-called strong AI, but is currently rather more 
the topic of science ﬁction than AI research. 
The starting point for many considerations on the ethics of AI are the early robot 
laws of Isaac Asimov. These three laws, which Asimov developed in 1942, are 
supposed to counteract the robot’s potential danger to humans by prohibiting actions 
(or omissions of actions) that cause harm to humans (ﬁrst law), leaving the power 
of command over the robot with the human (second law), and ensuring the robot’s 
self-preservation (third law). The laws are hierarchically structured, i.e. the third law 
may only be followed as long as the ﬁrst two laws are not violated by it. However, 
as inﬂuential as Asimov’s work was initially, it does not provide a sufﬁcient and 
effective basis for the design of robots in general ( ˇCas et al., 2017; Clarke,  1993, 
1994). 
Transparency as central requirement 
The evocation of a potentially emerging “superintelligence” has certainly fueled the 
media hype surrounding ethical (and often dystopian) issues of AI. But there are 
also enough questions about the current state of the art and the expected further

192

development of weak AI that should be discussed and resolved in a broad societal 
discourse. This is all the more so as AI already plays an important role in people’s 
everyday lives, and will play and inﬂuence many more in the near future. A central 
demand in this discourse is that of transparency, both about the use of AI (see above), 
and the modes of its operation, the built-in algorithms and their mode of action. 
Transparency is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition to control systems and thus 
build trust in them, which can also promote social acceptance. Society, and affected 
users or persons concerned, need to know how it works, but they also need a legal 
framework to be able to call for disclosure and sue for damages. There is also a 
need for institutions, which are able to both legally and technically deal with open 
questions from those affected. This leads to ongoing discourse on different levels of 
transparency and the respective means of governance. 
Catalogue of ethical principles for AI 
Besides transparency and (ex-post) evaluation of algorithmic systems there is a funda-
mental need to set standards for the whole development process from the very begin-
ning. There are already a large number of initiatives of various kinds around the 
world that deal with ethical principles for AI. These include supranational associa-
tions such as the OECD, international professional associations such as the IEEE, 
and civil society initiatives. 
A few examples illustrate the aims of these initiatives and their overlaps: funda-
mentally, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies of the 
European Commission published a declaration on artiﬁcial intelligence, robotics and 
“autonomous” systems in March 2018 (EuropeanCommission; DG Research & Inno-
vation, 2018). This calls for the launch of a process that would pave the way for the 
development of a common, internationally recognized ethical and legal framework 
for the design, production, use, and governance of artiﬁcial intelligence, robotics, 
and “autonomous” systems. The declaration also proposes a set of ethical principles, 
based on the values enshrined in the EU Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental 
Rights of the European Union that can guide the development of this process: 
• Human dignity 
• Autonomy 
• Equality and solidarity 
• Responsibility, accountability 
• Justice 
• Democracy, rule of law 
• Safety, security 
• Physical and mental integrity 
• Data protection and privacy 
• Sustainability. 
These fundamental principles should guide the development process on a meta-
level, but there are also more speciﬁc requirements. In 2017 the Asilomar AI prin-
ciples were developed—23 demands in the domains of research, ethics and values 
and long-term issues (Future of Life Institute, 2017). In 2018, the U.S.-based NGO

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New Knowledge …
193
Public Voice published universal guidelines for AI (The Public Voice, 2018) and 
presented them at a major privacy conference in Brussels. 
In 2019, a group of experts presented a policy paper with guidelines for the EU 
(AI HLEG, 2019). Based on fundamental rights and ethical principles, the guidelines 
list seven key requirements that AI systems should meet to be trustworthy: 
• Human action and oversight 
• Technical robustness and security 
• Privacy and data management 
• Transparency 
• Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness 
• Social and environmental well-being 
• Accountability. 
They are more or less equivalent to the dimensions raised in Public Voice guide-
lines. However, they go further by demanding the prohibition of secret proﬁling 
and making the general statement that governments must not generalize citizen 
assessment. 
As can be seen from these lists, there seems to be a consensus that human dignity 
must be preserved, and humans should have ultimate control over systems. In turn, 
the resulting accountability can only be exercised if there is transparency regarding 
the modes of operation and algorithms. Transparency is also a basic condition for 
the establishment of efﬁcient control systems, which are indispensable for effective 
regulation. In the context of global competition for the further development of AI, 
Europe tries to gain a quality advantage and thus a competitive edge with high ethical 
(and technical) standards. This is one of the main objectives of the proposed AI Act 
by the EU-Commission in April 2020.24 Even though this proposed Act evolved from 
a consultation process, it does not cover all respective issues, deemed important from 
different stakeholders. However, it opens up public discourse on issues like high-risk 
AI systems, proﬁling, data protection, and biases in AI systems and ethics. This 
means that the limits society wants to set for advanced AI will have to be discussed. 
What do we want to delegate to machines, and what do we never want machines to 
decide? 
According to Grimm (2018), “in order to use the Promethean potential of digi-
talization for a good life, we need … a digital value culture based on four pillars: 
(a) education and training (promoting ethical digital competence), (b) business and 
industry (value-conscious leadership, sustainable data economy), (c) research (inter-
disciplinary projects that bring together ethical and technological perspectives), and 
(d) political will (promoting value-based technology research)”. In a global context 
TA could be a valuable partner in this enterprise, contributing on different levels.

Conclusions on Practical Perspectives for Increased 
Global TA Co-operation and for Including Global TA 
in International Debate and Governance 
This paper shows some of the hopes and fears regarding the widespread use of AI 
in more or less all areas of living. Visions of technological development, economic 
growth, higher efﬁciency and a better life are contrasted with a potential loss of 
workforce, poverty and dangerous development of cultures of discourse, which— 
combined with power inequalities—may lead to erosion of democracy. 
AI as an emerging policy context has attracted widespread attention from govern-
ments, industry, culture and research in major economies around the world. Driven 
by policies in major economies such as China, the EU and the US, AI is gradually 
moving from basic research to more concrete application scenarios. However, there 
are still a number of issues and challenges before AI can become a truly general-
purpose technology. Along its way, AI needs open discourse based on scientiﬁc facts, 
taking into account societal values. There is already input from TA institutions around 
the world on the speciﬁc features and potential impact of AI implementation. But 
there are open questions, which need translation from technological development to 
every-day life and back—and even more so on a global level. 
As AI will inﬂuence nearly all areas of life, the context of use will be very diverse. 
In order to foster the development of responsible AI, there is a need for a global 
ethical baseline for AI developers, implementers and users. Elaborating general 
and globally accepted guidelines or codes of conduct need broad discourse and the 
participation of all those potentially involved together with affected stakeholders. 
Transparency of AI systems is a fundamental prerequisite for accountability 
and control. There is a gap between understanding this requirement and the often 
mentioned “black-box” in AI, which supposedly makes it impossible to get full trans-
parency over system-internal processes of decision-making. So, what kind of trans-
parency is achievable, and what is needed? What does it mean if those demands don’t 
match? Clarifying this in an interdisciplinary manner and communicating possible 
options to politics is a basic function of TA. 
The diffusion and application of AI technologies has the potential to bring 
about tremendous changes to the social structure. The digitalization of human 
society will continue to be accelerated with the application and diffusion of AI 
technologies. However, AI as a new social resource will also be affected by the 
differences in resource allocation due to the previously existing problems in the 
traditional social structure. The development of AI will increase the potential risk of 
digital inequality on a global scale. 
Responsible AI urgently requires global collaborative governance in a multi-
cultural context. While AI has demonstrated the potential to become a general-
purpose technology in a global context, the application scenarios of AI technology 
in speciﬁc countries and regions will be inﬂuenced by social, economic, cultural, and 
religious differences. Responsible AI should be based on the premise that it respects 
the diversity of people, and cultural and social settings, as well as the AI scenarios and

Artiﬁcial Intelligence—A New Knowledge …
195
the diversity of governance concepts. Based on the diversity of governance concepts, 
all countries should enhance the transparency and credibility of AI development 
through collaborative governance in a global context. In addition, responsible data 
is the cornerstone of responsible AI. 
The development and application of AI technologies will have a signiﬁcant 
impact on geopolitical relations on a global scale. There are huge differences 
between developed and developing countries in terms of data resource allocation, 
basic research and development capabilities, and the level of industrial transforma-
tion. Accordingly, if AI is treated as a general-purpose technology, the realization of 
AI application scenarios will potentially create new global development imbalances 
that are detrimental to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.25 
Abundant empirical research is required to determine whether AI can be 
regarded as a general-purpose technology. As mentioned in the policy discussion 
in Sect. 3, current policies of application areas promote AI as a fundamental techno-
logical ecosystem in every domain. However, AI is still far from a general-purpose 
technology in terms of economics and societal performance. In addition, the devel-
opment of AI strongly relies on the integration of related data-driven technologies. 
Data resource allocation is the key to determining AI as a general-purpose tech-
nology. However, a large amount of data resources (including personal data) is now 
controlled by giant online platform companies with signiﬁcant market power. From a 
long-term perspective, data resource monopoly is not conducive to sustainable inno-
vation in AI technologies. Therefore, both policy research and practice require an 
integrated view that data governance, platform governance and AI development be 
viewed as an intact ecosystem. 
All of this calls for accompanying research and monitoring, as well as cross-
cultural negotiation processes about desirable properties of AI systems and limits of 
application. TA can constructively contribute to this, if it succeeds in establishing 
corresponding global processes and institutions.

Introduction 
The twenty-ﬁrst century has been referred to as a time of emerging systemic risks 
(OECD, 2003). Many such risks relate to biological agents: emerging infectious 
diseases (EIDs) such as SARS, Ebola and Zika have become global threats. Because 
of its speciﬁc characteristics, COVID-19 has posed novel and unanticipated chal-
lenges to all social systems on a simultaneous, global scale, something not seen in 
recent human history. At the same time, it has laid bare pre-existing fragilities in 
health, economics and politics all over the globe. Such fragilities will be accentuated 
or make recovery from the pandemic more challenging in all countries (Baral, 2021). 
Historically, the largest share of health risks has been assumed by people in the 
Global South. Fighting infectious diseases has rarely been a top priority for global 
politics. COVID-19, however, has become a uniquely relevant threat, not only for 
least developed countries (LDC), but also for global health systems in afﬂuent soci-
eties. Just as the effects of COVID-19 are interconnected, emerging responses to 
the pandemic have become interdependent. Billions of dollars were invested in the

global scientiﬁc response to address the pandemic, and researchers from many coun-
tries were mobilized to undertake unprecedented efforts and start new international 
collaborations in ﬁnding solutions to the crisis. In this way, COVID-19 has not only 
exempliﬁed the global nature of risks in a hyper-connected world, but also that 
resilience needs to be conceptualized and fostered on a global scale. 
In this chapter, we argue that COVID-19 has posed signiﬁcant challenges, but 
also offers a valuable opportunity to rethink and improve how to effectively govern 
global health risks in ways that consider the potential unintended consequences of 
risk mitigation measures. We focus on fostering innovation capacities as a key feature 
of adaptive and transformative resilience in any complex system (Folke, 2006). In the 
context of health crises, technological innovations play a particularly important role. 
For instance, powerful algorithms can support local and national governments in 
managing large amounts of data and maintaining situational awareness; new surveil-
lance tools can facilitate the tracking of those who are infected and mitigate the 
spread of the virus; and innovative medical research methods can provide treat-
ments and vaccines to the population, offering hopes for a return to normality. But 
in many ways, the full potential of these innovations was not fully realized as imag-
ined; tracing apps, for instance, are mistrusted by many people and often do not 
function across national borders. A lack of international solidarity slowed down the 
development, production and distribution of vaccines (Dosi & Soete, 2022). At the 
same time, vaccine hesitancy and low scientiﬁc and public health literacy sometimes 
propelled by the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories have hampered 
the effectiveness of mass vaccination campaigns. 
To make the best use of available and emerging technologies, we, therefore, need 
transparent and trustworthy innovation governance structures that attend to potential 
risks for the wellbeing of society. Studies in the ﬁeld of technology assessment (TA) 
have shown that the cost of inaction may sometimes be greater than the need to make 
decisions quickly in response to emerging threats (van Baalen et al., 2021), but the 
accelerated development of technology may also create unintended and undesired 
consequences (Monteiro et al., 2017). In the case of COVID-19, there is a massive 
demand for rapid innovations (Lorgelly & Adler, 2020), and many challenges with 
respect to the proper conduct of detailed assessments. Technology assessment must 
consider the potential beneﬁts, costs and risks of new medical treatments (Alkhaldi 
et al., 2021), but how can this be achieved in a global crisis? 
This chapter suggests an answer to this question through outlining the elements 
which we believe should guide TA initiatives related to COVID-19. Such efforts 
should, as an a priori, engage global publics and involve institutions from different 
countries and regions. Assessing potential unintended effects of technologies adopted 
during a fast-moving crisis, including vaccines and apps, involves the incorporation 
of reﬂection on how vaccinations may interact with social cohesion, or how perceived 
risks to civil liberties in the context of new surveillance regimes affects uptake of 
tracing apps. Yet current governance structures and assessment protocols insufﬁ-
ciently consider both the immediacy of global health challenges, and the increasingly 
international nature of innovation processes.

Global Systems Resilience and Pandemic …

To better understand the governance challenges of global technological innova-
tion processes under the pressures of a global health crisis, this chapter looks at two 
technologies that have played a key role in public health strategies used to mitigate the 
COVID-19 pandemic: vaccines and tracing apps. We argue that these technologies 
and their governance have faced three interrelated challenges: problems of scale, trust 
and politics. These challenges, as they played out in the emergent use of these tech-
nologies, help us to identify some of the failures of governance and indicate potential 
ways to improve resilience for the future. We hope to provide inspiration for local, 
national or even international TA exercises to incorporate these principles into the 
way technologies with a global reach are developed and incorporated into responses 
during emergencies and beyond. The chapter argues that these three elements need 
to be considered when imagining and implementing such frameworks. 
2 
Technological Innovations for the Management of Global 
Health Crises 
Governance of technologies during a pandemic involves various interrelated chal-
lenges; TA that is tailored for and reﬂexive to such challenges is needed to achieve 
ﬂexible, effective and inclusive responses in a fast-moving crisis without losing sight 
of potential risks (Eckhard et al., 2021). In the context of COVID-19, advances in the 
fast-growing domains of information and data sciences as well as biotechnologies 
have received broad attention as key areas in the response against the virus. Governing 
these powerful, but potentially also risky technologies, involves stakeholders such 
as public and private health actors, alongside research and policy approaches. 
Past examples are useful for reﬂection on the role of governance during emerging 
pandemics: the Zika outbreak in the Americas (2015–2016) is an example of how such 
biological risks can emerge and spread with high speed, challenging global response 
mechanisms. In these scenarios, inadequate policy choices can lead to public distrust 
in science or expertise, and can fail to adequately protect the population, save lives 
and prevent future risks. In the case of Zika, the different responses implemented 
in various countries and the expertise produced by multilateral organizations were 
the object of intense and widespread controversy. This included the way in which 
women’s rights and poverty in LDC countries were framed (Roa, 2016), and how 
the use of untested technologies such as transgenic mosquitoes (Ribeiro et al., 2018) 
was decided and implemented, especially in Global South countries. These cases 
contributed to undermining trust in multilateral organizations and the manner in 
which they offered advice to respond to the pandemic, and raised issues related to 
the disparities in how countries were affected by and were able to respond to a global 
outbreak. These challenges would come up again with COVID-19, but on a much 
larger scale, involving the whole world. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is also wrought with controversy and disputes around 
science, technology and expertise. The use of big data tools, including tracing apps

206
M. Monteiro et al.
and other technologies to track and isolate individuals with COVID-19, in an attempt 
to slow the spread of the virus, was widely debated throughout 2020, the ﬁrst year 
of the pandemic (Gasser et al., 2020). While in some countries, contact tracing 
apps quickly gained broad public acceptance and became a cornerstone of efforts 
to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, elsewhere they failed to achieve the necessary 
public penetration to become effective (Altmann et al., 2020). As will be discussed 
in detail below, the success or failure of tracing apps strongly depends on the avail-
ability of governance structures to introduce these health innovations in a transparent, 
trustworthy and risk-aware fashion. 
Controversies around how surveillance should be used to manage pandemics, or 
the introduction of new technologies, have, therefore, been widespread during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Comparative studies have shown, however, that controversies 
were not uniform across societies (Jasanoff et al., 2021). In many countries, misin-
formation and political polarization were major obstacles in getting innovations to 
the population. This was most visible perhaps in the US and Brazil, countries among 
those with the highest numbers of infections and deaths, in contexts where widespread 
extremist and denialist groups forced public debate to deal with anti-science, and 
anti-vaccine positions, which even questioned the existence of the pandemic. 
In both the US and Brazil, anti-China positions have been signiﬁcant elements 
in political responses to the crisis. This has shown the importance not only of 
taking stock of the available knowledge to support decisions, but the importance 
of understanding how political disputes can undermine a public health response, or 
even wholly impede the development of mitigation strategies. Vaccine hesitancy, for 
example, has been recognized as a challenge to public health policies, and it has been 
potentialized by organized misinformation in many countries (Tokojima Machado 
et al., 2020). 
Each of these scenarios was a factor in explaining the number of deaths in speciﬁc 
contexts, and thus are crucial in understanding where speciﬁc countries failed or 
succeeded in curbing deaths from COVID-19. But building global resilience to 
pandemics requires reﬂection on the measures and principles which can be applied 
across different contexts, and in country-speciﬁc policy regimes. Therefore, under-
standing policy and governance failures on a global scale (like those related to 
COVID-19) requires reﬂection on broader patterns, and poses challenges to building 
one-size-ﬁts-all solutions (Jasanoff et al., 2021).

Facing the Challenges of a Global Crisis Response: Scale, 
Trust and Politics 
To face the governance challenges posed by global crises, we need to broaden how we 
imagine and practice governance of technologies to include social, cultural and polit-
ical issues. To achieve this, we need to acknowledge a threefold challenge present 
in the COVID-19 pandemic, which can help us better understand the gaps which

Global Systems Resilience and Pandemic …
207
need to be addressed. These challenges include issues of scale, trust and politics. 
Each of these elements is inevitably interrelated with the others, but can be sepa-
rated analytically to provide insights regarding the enduring difﬁculties involved in 
building resilience to future crises. Calls for reimagining governance are not new: 
Global institutions have already called for responses and governance of technologies 
to become more dialogical, responsive and globally interconnected if we are to build 
longer-term resilience to future pandemics (UN, 2020). Our discussion builds on this 
emerging debate and outlines three elements which should inform global governance 
frameworks and assessment practices. 
3.1 
Scale: Dealing with Global Risks 
A central issue in mitigating a pandemic is the sheer scale of the crisis: The speed 
of transmission and adaptation of the virus; the interconnected nature of global 
commerce and supply chains (Hobbs, 2020); the need to develop simultaneous 
responses at global, national and local levels, etc. Without a global approach, linked 
to other levels of governance, resilience alone will never be robust enough for similar 
situations. (see Ladikas and Stamm; Hennen and van Est, this volume). 
There is thus broad debate about global pandemics needing concurrent global 
solutions (UN, 2020). In these discussions, countries are discouraged from seeking 
exclusively national or regional solutions. In the early spread of COVID-19, and in the 
challenge posed by emerging variants, tracking infections across national borders has 
been a continuous challenge. In the ﬁrst half of 2020, when global production chains 
of health supplies were pressured to the limit, and a China-centered global division of 
labor also became a global problem (as most medical supplies in demand, including 
masks and ventilators are mass-produced in China), global interconnectivity became 
starkly apparent: Global circulation of people helped spread the virus, and global 
interdependencies in the economy were put to the test. 
Even though the importance of tracking infections across national borders for 
containing COVID-19 was recognized early on by public health experts and authori-
ties alike, most tracing apps were developed and implemented in the ﬁrst half of 2020 
at the national level (in countries like China and Germany) but often remained non-
interoperational, mainly for technical or legal reasons (Jacob & Lawarée, 2021; Russo 
et al., 2021). This limitation particularly hampered the ability to contain infections 
in border regions with many international commuters, for example, at the German– 
French and German-Swiss borders. This has changed only slowly in 2021–2022, as 
the compatibility of several European tracing apps was improved (Blasimme et al., 
2021). 
Vaccines are also an example of how scale matters in TA: Vaccines were quickly 
developed due to a massive inﬂux of resources (public and private), yet this has not 
meant that all people have had access to the resulting immunization opportunities. 
Treating vaccines as a market commodity (rather than a public good) has effectively 
concentrated the availability of vaccines in a few countries, leaving most of the

208
M. Monteiro et al.
world with restricted or no access (Katz et al., 2021). This concentration of buying 
power relates to global supply chains, also concentrated in some countries (such as 
India and China). But it is also connected to the global disparities in science and 
R&D infrastructure, which restricts capabilities of vaccine development and enables 
vaccine nationalism and vaccine diplomacy, which subsume vaccination efforts to 
global power plays between nations (Dosi & Soete, 2022). The regulatory approval 
processes were also indicative of the challenge of scale: As vaccination started in 
early 2021, the diversity of national, regional and global approval processes created 
confusion around which vaccines were more effective and how to organize global 
vaccination efforts. In regions like the EU, where parallel national and regional 
(EMA) processes exist, this added a layer of complexity which added to controversy 
around speciﬁc vaccines (e.g., Sputnik V) and affected public trust. 
Some initiatives attempted to mitigate this problem, with COVAX1 being the most 
important (Eccleston-Turner & Upton, 2021). While it appears to have had success 
in ensuring more investment in vaccine development and accelerating the roll-out of 
technology, the multilateral initiative appears not to have addressed problems such 
as vaccine nationalism, whereby countries prioritize their own citizens’ needs to the 
detriment of more effective global vaccination efforts. This is a huge challenge for 
any governance effort that attempts to have signiﬁcant global reach: Can we build 
effective global public health strategies at all, if nation-states are still at the center of 
decision-making, funding and distribution? 
The emergence and diffusion of several variants of the COV-SARS2 virus in 
different world regions has put to the test the effectiveness of even the most compre-
hensive national vaccination campaigns in countries such as Israel. In a dramatic 
way, this demonstrates that no country is safe, as long as the virus is able to spread 
and mutate easily elsewhere. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned in 
March 2020: “The magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis. (…) 
We are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world”.2 
Imagining a more effective “global TA” can become an important step in the right 
direction in the case of addressing problems of scale: By providing fora, concepts, 
and arenas of debate that enable global conversations, and enabling better articulation 
of local, national and global forms of action, a truly global TA can make a positive 
policy contribution. Will nations continue to resist broader interference from orga-
nizations such as the WHO, especially in times of crisis where those with political 
and economic power push their way to the front of the line for vaccines? Combining 
trust in global solutions with the need for local situatedness is a major scientiﬁc

launched in April 2020 in response to this pandemic. Bringing together governments, global health 
organizations, manufacturers, scientists, private sector, civil society and philanthropy, with the aim 
of providing innovative and equitable access to COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. 
The COVAX pillar is focused on the latter. It is the only truly global solution to this pandemic 
because it is the only effort to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to 
COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth.” (source: https://www.gavi.

and policy dilemma. How to build trust and increase the adherence of countries and 
publics to measures that contribute to systemic resilience on a global scale, while 
many of them demand collective action and impact (including vaccination), remains 
an open question. 
Producing assessments of technologies for use in global crises presents unique 
challenges: The need for global and interconnected responses has been deﬁned, 
but how can TA be performed when countries diverge so greatly in their histories, 
cultures, values and political systems? The production of global surveillance mech-
anisms through apps may face resistance from countries where individual freedom 
and privacy are relevant, but not from countries where collectivity is cherished. But 
governments may resist such broad surveillance without proper guarantees to each 
country’s sovereignty as regards data, for example. Vaccination on a global scale 
also presents overwhelming challenges: Convincing global publics of the need to 
adhere to vaccination schemes seems daunting when anti-vaccination movements 
are so effective in developed nations, and when access to health is so unequal across 
the globe. Trust in expertise produced globally is also problematic, as the example 
of the IPCC3 —Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—shows (Beck, 2012; 
Hulme & Mahony, 2010). So how can global institutions and publics be engaged 
during a crisis of trust? 
3.2 
Trust: Improving Adherence and Participation 
The issue of trust can be positioned with respect to longstanding debates within 
STS (Science, Technology and Society4 ) and social sciences concerning the place of 
science in modern liberal democracies, and the shifts this relationship has undergone 
since the second half of the twentieth century (Miller, 2008). While science is a central
3 Created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Envi-
ronment Programme (UNEP), the objective of the IPCC is to provide governments at all levels with 
scientiﬁc information that they can use to develop climate policies. IPCC reports are also a key 
input into international climate change negotiations. The IPCC is an organization of governments 
that are members of the United Nations or WMO. The IPCC currently has 195 members. (source: 
https://www.ipcc.ch/about/). 
4 STS, as practiced in academia today, merges two broad streams of scholarship. The ﬁrst consists 
of research on the nature and practices of science and technology (S&T). Studies in this genre 
approach S&T as social institutions possessing distinctive structures, commitments, practices, and 
discourses that vary across cultures and change over time. This line of work addresses questions 
like the following: is there a scientiﬁc method; what makes scientiﬁc facts credible; how do new 
disciplines emerge; and how does science relate to religion? The second stream concerns itself more 
with the impacts and control of science and technology, with particular focus on the risks, beneﬁts 
and opportunities that S&T may pose to peace, security, community, democracy, environmental 
sustainability and human values. Driving this body of research is questions like the following: how 
should states set priorities for research funding; who should participate, and how, in technological 
decision-making; should life forms be patented; how should societies measure risks and set safety 
standards; and how should experts communicate the reasons for their judgments to the public?

feature of how modern democracies are imagined, its authority has been under serious 
question for decades (Ezrahi, 1980). The way this issue has resurfaced in the twenty-
ﬁrst century will undoubtedly be the subject of intense scrutiny for a long time. Here, 
we discuss how this was made visible in the speciﬁc technological controversies in 
focus in this chapter, namely how innovations used in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic have been received by publics in different countries. This is important if 
we are to reimagine governance, preserving a place for science in democracy while 
respecting skepticism and resistance to expert-centered decision-making. 
The issue of trust (in direct relation to politics and values) has had an impact on 
the way TA is theorized and practiced during the pandemic, as recognized in the 
European context (van Baalen et al., 2021): 
However, political decisions cannot be based on scientiﬁc evidence alone; other political, 
social, economic, legal and moral considerations also play a role. This has also been the 
case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anti-COVID-19 measures, such as lockdowns, social 
distancing or the introduction of tracing apps generally had broader impacts than mitigating 
the spread of the virus, such as social isolation and an increased demand of health services. 
To decide on such measures, policymakers must also weigh different values and interests. 
In most cases, however, this was not communicated clearly and transparently to the broader 
public. Policymakers often referred to scientiﬁc evidence or experts to substantiate their 
decisions, without acknowledging the role of other considerations in the choices made. (van 
Baalen et al., 2021, 11) 
Controversies about technologies and COVID-19 have a direct relationship to the 
issues of governance we want to raise here, inasmuch as they relate to how publics 
accept or reject expert advice coming from national and/or global institutions; how 
they trust governments with their personal data, and how they accept surveillance 
(e.g., in the case of tracing apps); how publics accept and trust vaccines and vacci-
nation campaigns, which is a longstanding issue in public health; and how they 
respond to other measures which impinge on their freedom and their health. Over 
many years, risk communication research has shown that trust is a central precondi-
tion for successful political communication related to risk, but also that public trust 
in ofﬁcial risk communication messages is dependent on perceptions of the commu-
nicating individuals and institutions, as well as the speciﬁc socio-political climate 
(Renn & Levine, 1991). COVID-19 has sparked many such controversies in different 
countries and has shown the degree to which issues of trust are central to establishing 
longer-term resilience to global health crises. 
Vaccine hesitancy, for example, has been debated and recognized as a central 
concern to public health in many countries (Verger & Dubé, 2020), and sentiments 
of mistrust directed at vaccines have emerged strongly with COVID-19. While more 
common in industrialized Global North countries, hesitancy has also affected other 
areas of the world. This can be traced back to many possible factors, such as mistrust 
in the speed of vaccine development, organized strategies, and well-funded efforts 
to spread misinformation (Jaiswal et al., 2020). 
In the case of COVID-19, the pandemic has been accompanied by a veritable 
“infodemic” (Cuan-Baltazar et al., 2020). Misinformation (be it organized or unin-
tended) has proven to be a prominent feature of how the pandemic evolved in many

countries, affecting trust in public health authorities, technical decisions and tech-
nologies (especially vaccines). The Internet has become the main source of news and 
information, as well as a dangerous source of misinformation. Studies have shown 
that the speed and broad reach of misinformation on COVID-19 undermines trust 
in policies and vaccines, and is considered thus a public health concern in itself 
(Roozenbeek et al., 2020) in countries with disparate and distinct socioeconomic 
proﬁles. Indeed, the erosion of trust in science and institutions was a prominent trait 
in countries such as the US, Brazil and Italy (Battiston et al., 2020; Kreps & Kriner, 
2020). 
Ensuring adequate governance of the development and deployment of vaccines 
has already been recognized as the surest way out of the pandemic, but how can gover-
nance bodies deal with the increasing politicization of this technology? The contro-
versies which emerge, sometimes fueled by speciﬁc political groups, or weaponized 
by extremists, have concrete effects on efforts to vaccinate globally, and may prolong 
the pandemic or even contribute to the emergence of increasingly dangerous virus 
variants. Addressing issues of trust is a conditio sine qua non for building both an 
effective short-term response (Islam et al., 2021) (improving adherence to vaccina-
tion, for example), but also for building resilience in terms of stronger relationships 
of trust between institutions and citizens (at the national level), and global trust in 
international governance bodies (at the international level). 
The case of tracing apps shows that the importance of trust for a successful diffu-
sion of technological innovations in the context of public health is not exclusive to 
vaccines. Similar to vaccination programs aiming for herd immunity, tracing apps 
strongly rely on broad use across society. Only if a considerable share of the popula-
tion uses the apps in their everyday life are these tools able to fulﬁll their purpose and 
help to track and break infection chains. When introduced in many countries in the 
ﬁrst half of 2020, there were high hopes that the apps could effectively slow down 
the spread of the COVID-19 virus, gaining time until vaccines would be broadly 
available. However, the usefulness of the tracing apps turned out to be much lower 
than expected by many policymakers and experts, mainly because too few people 
were willing to install and actively use the tracing apps. 
Studies in various countries have shown that besides technical difﬁculties and 
fears of false positive alerts, a lack of trust in the apps was a main reason as to why 
these technologies were not used more broadly and today are often considered as 
failures (Bano et al., 2020; Beierle et al., 2021; Horstmann et al., 2021). Yet this 
research also shows that the issue of trust played out quite differently depending 
on the speciﬁc political and cultural context in which they were implemented. In 
countries like the US and Germany, disputes occurred around the privacy of sensitive 
health data (Mello & Wang, 2020; Simon & Rieder, 2021). In other countries, such 
as Australia, fears were more general regarding governmental surveillance, while 
elsewhere public discourses focused more on the possible positive potential of these 
technologies (Greenleaf & Kemp, 2020). 
Importantly, several studies indicate that while general trust in political author-
ities is an important factor, it is not the only factor that inﬂuences public trust in 
tracing apps. Other factors that determine public acceptance of these technologies

212
M. Monteiro et al.
include the transparency of the technical architecture, and the societal inclusive-
ness of the development process, as well as the public communication measures 
to explain the purpose and function of the apps (Hobson et al., 2020; Oldeweme  
et al., 2021). In general, decentralized approaches, building on open-source tech-
nologies and backed by trusted partner institutions are found to generate high trust 
rates (Simon & Rieder, 2021). Since most apps were developed on behalf of govern-
mental actors and ﬁnanced with taxpayer money, this directly relates to the questions 
of innovation governance. As (Ranisch et al., 2020) emphasize, “(…) to minimize the 
risk of adverse outcomes, ethical standards should guide and complement the process 
of development (ethics by design), implementation, use, and evaluation of CT apps.” 
Policymakers can actively inﬂuence the level of public trust by setting these ethical 
standards to ensure an innovation process that pays close attention to the concerns 
of societal stakeholders and citizens over potential unintended side effects, such as 
misuse of software for public surveillance or theft of sensitive personal data. 
Building better governance and resilience, therefore, must include facing matters 
of trust as they relate to the science-policy interface, as this has to do with the 
shape of democracy itself and the role of science within modern democratic regimes. 
Mistrust in science, albeit often perceived as a problem, is not necessarily a symptom 
of anti-science, but can also reﬂect speciﬁc civic epistemologies, a dilemma already 
identiﬁed in STS (Ezrahi, 2008): 
The gap between scientiﬁc and civil presuppositions about the relations of science and politics 
in the contemporary democratic state poses a very difﬁcult challenge to STS scholars who 
must often switch back and forth between public policy contexts where expert deﬁnitions of 
causality are expected to have the authority to set the boundaries of possible value choices 
and strategies of action, and contexts where these are the social norms and conventions that 
set the limits to what are acceptable conceptions of causality. This often leads to confusions 
between an attitude of disrespect for scientiﬁc facts as a form of intellectual opportunistic 
relativism and as a considered critical response to the dogmatic advance of scientiﬁc facts 
as a means of defying working political or normative compromises. (Ezrahi, 2008, 181). 
This presents a great challenge also to assessment practices, as they try to balance 
expert knowledge, public engagement and their own validity as a tool for policy-
and decision-making in general. How should we construct TA at different scales in 
contexts where there is deep mistrust of vaccines? Or when experts are mistrusted, 
and misinformation is rampant? Governance frameworks have to be responsive to 
and reﬂective of situated civic epistemologies (Jasanoff, 2011b), and the ways in 
which policies are able to relate to science in situated ways in different national and 
cultural contexts. Because science and society can be seen as coproduced (Jasanoff, 
2004), governance and resilience must also pay attention to how these relationships 
are established and sustain themselves in speciﬁc contexts. TA organized on a global 
scale would be supportive in strengthening awareness of this interconnectedness, as 
well as inducing mutual learning about different national contexts that need to be 
taken into account when designing technologies and policies which are appropriate 
to existing civic epistemologies, along with the perceived needs and demands of the 
respective publics.

Global Systems Resilience and Pandemic …

3.3 
Politics: Social Justice and Global Inequalities 
As discussed above, issues of trust are crucial for understanding some of the chal-
lenges posed by global governance of technologies to build resilience. Issues of trust 
in science and technology, however, lead us into another broad challenge: how to 
reﬂect on and integrate politics into how we build resilience. Politicization of tech-
nologies such as vaccines became a problem in several nations during the pandemic 
(Bolsen & Palm, 2021). Another issue was how polarizing politics mediated how 
people adhered to “stay at home” policies and other measures which severely affected 
people’s lives. To begin addressing this challenge, we should reframe governance 
away from using a linear idea of science/policy relationships, and take into account 
the myriad other variables at play in such contexts (van Baalen et al., 2021), which 
include the core of people’s personal and collective values, and their ideas of 
desirable futures and politics, as discussed in concepts such as civic epistemolo-
gies (Jasanoff, 2011a; Miller, 2008). In addition, politics pertains to how power is 
distributed, and how inequalities make a difference, both locally and globally. 
Politics in our argument refers to the disputes around desired goals, and differing 
perceptions of what is at stake in a crisis. As in other controversies involving science 
and technology, the disputes at play in this pandemic are never just about the better 
solution (vaccines, masks, apps, etc.), but also concern a common appreciation of 
what the problem is, which in turn has implications for the framing of possible and 
desirable solutions (Venturini, 2010). Technical expertise does not by itself lower 
the temperature of controversy or mitigate political disputes (Nelkin, 1975), and 
controversies often also involve the legitimacy of who is able to provide reliable 
expertise or be present at the table to make decisions (Nelkin & Hilgartner, 1986). 
Disputes around trust and values tend to become highly visible in controversies, as 
STS literature has extensively shown (Collins & Pinch, 1998; Lynch & Cole, 2005). 
We understand the challenge of politics to be central to any effective attempt at 
building longer-term resilience to COVID-19 and future pandemics, and this may be 
the hardest challenge that countries and governance institutions have to face. Poli-
tics here also includes issues of how power is distributed in a given society, how 
decisions get made, and who gets to sit at the table in decision-making concerning 
pandemics. Of course, politics permeates every aspect of the discussion in this 
chapter, from vaccine nationalism to disparities in health. But political contesta-
tion of speciﬁc technologies used for COVID-19, and measures imposed by govern-
ments pose some speciﬁc challenges to both the imagination and implementation of 
governance frameworks, which deserve to be considered here. 
Politics can be a way to analyze and understand the way governance mechanisms 
play a role in pandemics, and how that role needs to be the object of further reﬂection 
in building resilience. Making choices about policies or the adoption of technologies 
is never just a matter of assessing cost and clinical effectiveness, but always an 
issue of politics. Acceptance of expertise; vaccine hesitancy, denialist groups and 
governments, etc., demonstrate how politics is not peripheral, but central to any 
attempt to build resilience to pandemics. It is common to see debates around the

214
M. Monteiro et al.
role of scientiﬁc uncertainty in political contestation (Kreps & Kriner, 2020), yet 
uncertainty in itself does not explain or help mitigate the political aspect of such 
choices, or contestation as part of responding to a pandemic. 
TA can itself be seen as a political arena, in which all of these issues are made 
explicit in speciﬁc ways. From the choices of who gets invited to an assessment 
exercise, to how assessment is conducted, politics is an important element of how 
TA is used as a way to make choices about technologies. Aside from the internal 
workings of assessment, one can also look at how assessment practices interact with 
broader policy dynamics: How much does assessment actually affect or inform policy 
in speciﬁc contexts? How would a global assessment body or exercise be able to have 
impact in different cultures, given the various ways technology is perceived? TA, 
whether global or not, should be reﬂexive and aware of its political embeddedness, 
and not invest in a purist or linear understanding of science-policy relationships. This 
is also a point made about the IPCC (Beck, 2012), and debates about global TA can 
ﬁnd inspiration in the critique of technocratic solutions made by studies of climate 
governance. 
This has never been so explicit or so urgent an issue as during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Politics relates inextricably to the elements discussed above. Adherence 
to solutions such as vaccines, or to longer-term measures which may be deemed 
inevitable for resilience, depend on people trusting institutions and feeling they are 
represented as part of the solutions being proposed. Becoming part of the decision-
making process also presupposes constructing common ground for deliberations 
around potential solutions. Going back to scale: When we talk of global pandemics, 
resilience involves engaging not only publics with similar cultural and historical 
backgrounds, shared values and aspirations, but also global publics with widely 
different histories, forms of government, values and ways of organizing technical 
decisions. Ignoring politics on the global scale will also hamper resilience, when for 
example we fail to achieve a global level of mass vaccination to control a pandemic; 
or when we fail to address health disparities, or disparities in access to science and 
technology. 
This problem of how science and technology relate to politics has led both the 
academic and policy communities to develop critical and applied reﬂections on how 
to build responsibility into governance frameworks and institutional practices (Jacob 
et al., 2013; Stilgoe et al., 2013), especially in the European context. TA is a prac-
tical outcome of such reﬂections with a long tradition of developing institutional 
formats and methodologies of policy advice in many European countries. Global 
governance to foster resilience to pandemics at a global level could beneﬁt from this 
experience (Ladikas et al., 2019; Van  Est,  2017). However, the COVID-19 pandemic 
has again emphasized questions of how to perceive responsibility as part of the 
response: When urgency demands incisive and speedy actions, how are countries to 
improve responsibility, responsiveness and reﬂexivity in their actions? Is the require-
ment for effective and fast decision-making, which characterizes any crisis, at odds 
with attempts to ensure inclusive political processes, or can participatory processes 
improve crisis responses by activating broad societal resources (Eckhard et al., 2021)? 
In the absence of global frameworks to distribute and make vaccines available in an

Global Systems Resilience and Pandemic …
215
affordable manner, how are countries which have been excluded from the vaccination 
effort to respond to calls for more “global cooperation,” or even trust in global insti-
tutions, which may involve external advice relating to hygiene, changes in economic 
policies or limits to movements inside and outside their national borders? 
Global and local-level disparities have played a huge role in this pandemic, as 
they have in other historical and recent outbreaks (Mamelund et al., 2021). These 
include disparate access to health, racial disparities and deep inequality in terms 
of available infrastructure to manage and respond to health emergencies. (Bibbins-
Domingo, 2020; Brooks, 2016; Quinn et al., 2011). Importantly, the vulnerability of 
different social groups is dependent on their speciﬁc material coping capacities, but 
also by social and psychological attributes (Eriksen et al., 2020). This means that 
governance frameworks and responses at all levels should take this into account if 
they intend to be effective. This has been acknowledged in international calls for 
action by organizations like the United Nations to prestigious research institutions 
(Martinez-Juarez et al., 2020), but it remains to be seen how this will be tackled in 
practice. 
Addressing disparities again throws us back into the need to include political 
choices and political disputes when discussing governance of technologies and 
technical advice. Building reliable international cooperation involves addressing 
immense disparities in access to research funding, health technology development, 
and the deployment and distribution of accessible and reliable information and treat-
ments. Current vaccine nationalism in the acquisition and distribution of vaccines, 
and the leveraging of vaccines in geopolitical strategies by countries such as China, 
India and the US erode trust in multilateral or global institutions and frameworks and 
lay bare the absence of material cooperation between unequal partners. Likewise, 
extreme disparities within national borders have shown to be detrimental to national 
social cohesion, opening countries to chaotic responses to COVID-19, with catas-
trophic consequences in terms of lives lost, increases in poverty and institutional 
disarray (Jasanoff et al., 2021).

Conclusions 
We have argued that building better global governance for the future involves matters 
of scale, trust and politics. Each element helps us to see different aspects of dilemmas 
posed and illuminated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as dilemmas for the 
governance of science and technology in general. Scale matters, because if risks 
have a global aspect, then institutions and policies need to have global reach. This 
demands international cooperation, trust and solidarity to overcome disparities within 
and between countries and regions. The production and distribution of vaccines has 
impacted on international relations and highlighted gaps relating to unequal distribu-
tion of R&D capacity (and how this is a risk for future resilience), as well as difﬁcul-
ties in producing and making vaccines available. Overcoming the pandemic means 
immunizing billions of people on a global scale, therefore, we have yet to establish

216
M. Monteiro et al.
new institutions and policies to make these risks more manageable. The COVAX 
facility offers some hope, but truly global solutions are still both underdeveloped 
and undertheorized. 
Trust is important both in terms of strengthening social cohesion within countries, 
and enabling greater acceptance of policies, therefore, ensuring the effectiveness of 
responses to crises like a global pandemic. The infodemic associated with COVID-19 
(but not restricted to it) has global ramiﬁcations, and needs to be addressed inter-
nationally. Trust among countries and between countries and global institutions is 
crucial to enable any kind of successful global governance to take effect. A gap in 
trust became clear during the Trump presidency in the US, for example, but mistrust 
between China and other countries, and between countries and the WHO or the UN 
also illustrate how this is relevant to global policies and resilience. 
Politics are never absent and can never be ignored. From the contestations of 
policies and expertise within countries, to the disparities that mark the pandemic 
(racial, gender, economic, etc.), politics is present in all aspects of the issue. Social 
disparities are central to understanding who suffers most during pandemics: Poor 
countries, and the poorest people within countries; minorities (ethnic, racial, sexual, 
cultural, religious, etc.), women, and those with limited access to health in general. 
Ignoring disparities makes trust unreachable and undermines how expertise helps 
to orient policy. It undermines both science and democracy if we do not remain 
vigilant of their interconnectedness. Assessing risks and governing technology needs 
to include and reﬂect on its political aspects as a central part of the expertise which is 
mobilized to understand the risks and beneﬁts of different innovations. The disparate 
capacity which countries have to produce, access and assess innovations can also 
become a global risk, especially during a global crisis, and is also an issue for global 
governance. 
This leads to the question regarding how to develop governance approaches that 
solve, or at least moderate, the challenges involving scale, trust and politics. While 
some efforts aim to improve global collaboration, but often fail to secure trust across 
diverse social and cultural contexts, others appear stronger in building trust, but 
in turn struggle to achieve internationally coordinated and uniﬁed progress against 
global health risks. To overcome this, new modes of governance are needed, based on 
principles of resilience thinking, inspired by research traditions in ecology, organi-
zational studies and other disciplines (Folke, 2006; Ruiz-Martin et al., 2018; Walker,  
2020). These approaches would focus on capabilities at the local level to develop 
innovative strategies to adapt to new trends and risks. However, such a decentralized 
approach does not mean that actors work in isolation. On the contrary, a resilience 
approach to global governance would put a strong emphasis on networks to exchange 
experiences and foster transboundary learning. This could provide the basis for new 
forms of governance that meet the global nature of the grand challenges of our time, 
while paying close attention to local cultural and political contexts.

Global Systems Resilience and Pandemic …
217
Attempts at governing globally through robust science-policy interfaces are still 
rare, and under construction (and dispute). The example of the IPCC as a mecha-
nism for providing reliable knowledge for governing climate change is interesting 
to examine, both for its successes and its failures. One important failure relates to 
the issue of politics mentioned here: When the science used for global governance 
is produced mainly in speciﬁc institutions in the Global North, by authors from this 
region (Ford et al., 2012), this poses a problem for building trust and engaging nations 
from other parts of the world. And although science is an example of a global network 
of practices and institutions with some embedded aspects of global governance, it is 
also a structurally unequal system. Therefore, to expect trust to emerge purely from 
the availability of reliable scientiﬁc knowledge is to ignore other aspects important 
to assessing the risks and potentials of science and technology. 
Global forms of governance need to address a series of issues, which are not on 
the agendas of the WHO or other governance schemes, but which can be mobilized to 
rethink global frameworks: The unequal geographies of science (Hulme, 2010) and 
technology which still mark the production of knowledge and the capacity to build 
technologies and innovations to address crises like the pandemics of the present and 
the future. This of course relates to the trust and politics discussed above: Governance 
of technologies at a global level cannot ignore issues of social justice, without which 
resilience will not be possible. Just as policies govern science and technologies 
conditioned by local perceptions, practices and histories, the knowledge that drives 
governance needs to also be reﬂected upon as emerging from unequal geographies, 
and therefore, needs to be governed with an aim to increase the participation of and 
attention to excluded and marginalized groups. 
This in turn relates closely to the issue of scale: The globalizing drive in the 
governance of climate change, for example, runs the risk of collapsing all scales 
into a generic and universalized “global,” which erases the local and other scales 
at which events and practices take shape. This view from everywhere, as discussed 
by Hulme (2010), needs to be critically assessed as the only possible governance 
scheme for global problems. As discussed above, local experiments, values and 
speciﬁcities have to be taken into account as another path to build resilience and 
global forms of governance which will be more legitimate, and therefore, engage 
broader global publics and institutions. TA as a practice at the interface of poli-
tics, science and the public provides appropriate structures and methodologies to 
enable democratic, inclusive and scientiﬁcally well-informed interactive processes 
of knowledge-sharing and deliberation. How to transform and apply this at a global 
level to foster resilience to pandemic disease is a challenge that needs to be considered 
from a long-term perspective.

Introduction 
Technology assessment (TA) has a history that shows constant progress. In the last 
ﬁfty years, since its initial conceptualisation as a strictly technocratic policy advisory, 
it has developed many different forms and shapes, while signiﬁcantly expanding its 
aims and outreach. It is fair to say that in the last three decades TA has increasingly 
become more accessible to the non-expert world and has even created a unique rela-
tionship with the public. This development is on par with similar transformations in 
our societies that have resulted in publics that are more open, inclusive and aware of

their power in inﬂuencing policymaking. Furthermore, TA has reafﬁrmed its relation-
ship to social transformation regarding the realities of widespread socio-economic 
internationalisation and globalisation. It quickly accepted the fact that multilateralism 
is evident in every aspect of our lives and that the perception of global challenges 
is key in any Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) debate around the world. 
Thus, TA advanced its global outreach by developing the notion of global TA, which 
represents an inevitable development in its history. 
This book is one of the many steps that are needed to develop a brand of TA that 
is truly global; in other words, a type of TA that can focus on global problems and 
be implemented in most national or cultural contexts equally well. This is a very 
high aspiration for TA, but one that is worthwhile pursuing. The European Parlia-
mentary Technology Assessment network1 (EPTA) and the Network Technology 
Assessment2 (NTA), have been the ﬁrst successful attempts to create a fully func-
tional multicultural TA. Based on their successes, and coupled with the experience 
of many fruitful bilateral TA projects across the globe, the globalTA3 Network came 
into existence. At present, the globalTA Network has thirty members, representing 
all ﬁve continents and a rich variety of TA activities in every ﬁeld of STI. The creation 
of these multilateral networks certainly shows a strong impetus in the TA community 
to achieve a global outreach. 
This book has provided a number of narratives that argue for the future of global 
TA. The juggernaut of globalisation and the STI interdependences that have been 
created as a result, already postulate a realistic argument for the development of 
global TA (see Hennen and van Est, this volume). The recent pandemic crisis was a 
rude reminder of the urgency of the undertaking (see Monteiro et al., this volume), 
while the demands of publics around the world for a viable STI create the need to 
design a careful approach for a viable result (See van Est and Hennen, this volume). 
Overall, we ﬁnd no doubt that TA is crucial in the resolution of global challenges 
as described in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) (see Ladikas and Stamm, 
this volume), promoting international development (see Srinivas and van Est, this 
volume), and regulating technologies with global outreach (see van Baalen et al. as 
well as, Huang and Peissl, this volume). The questions that have been raised in these 
narratives are: How to attain a viable global TA? What is the most effective, and most 
realistic, route to develop it? How to achieve widespread acceptance of TA tools in 
very different socio-economic and political contexts? And, how to account for a fair 
collaboration among economically unequal partners?

The Institutionalisation of TA 
Behind these questions is an issue that has occupied the TA community since its 
beginning in the 1960s: the question of modes of institutionalising TA practises, and 
setting up appropriate designs of TA institutions. 
Any public debate or controversy on the pros and cons, the opportunities and risks, 
or the ethical implications of implementing and applying technological innovations 
can be understood as an informal process of technology assessment (Rip et al., 1995). 
It involves researchers and companies promoting the adoption of their innovations 
by highlighting their achievements and practical or economic advantages. At the 
same time, it involves various interest groups and affected communities, which in 
one way or the other are legitimatised and enabled to intervene with regulations and 
funding, and address their demands and concerns directly to policymakers. Finally, 
it involves experts with different scientiﬁc backgrounds who are drawn by different 
actors to support their own points of view. The opposite structure is also true: any 
ofﬁcial process or project of technology assessment can be understood as formalised 
technology controversies that involve all the above actors in a procedure controlled 
by a TA institution (Hennen, 1999; Hennen & Ladikas, 2019). 
The need for and the modes of institutionalisation have been an issue of debate 
and practical experiments right from the initial discussions about TA as a speciﬁc 
concept (Sanz-Menendez & Cruz-Castro, 2004). The origins of TA are related to the 
1960s debates on the perceived deﬁcit of politics to steer technological change and 
intervene in controversies in a meaningful way that is based on reliable knowledge. 
Thus, the most relevant, and up to now persisting, question about TA institution-
alisation, has been how to relate science to policymaking in a way that avoids both 
over-ruling politics with technocratic expertise and the instrumentalization of science 
by politics. To date, many different models of independent scientiﬁc TA advice have 
been developed at regional, national and international policymaking levels (whether 
at government ministries or parliaments), all concerned with providing independent 
advice as well as relevance of expertise for the practical purposes and needs of poli-
cymaking (Enzing et al., 2012; Hennen & Ladikas, 2009; van  Est et al.,  2015; Vig  &  
Paschen, 2000). 
The second salient problem to be translated into institutionalised practises gained 
relevance during the 1980s: How to have a meaningful and equal representation of 
the interests and values of societal groups and stakeholders in TA processes? This 
has led to the development of a broad set of participatory methods applied by TA 
institutions, and a slight readjustment of the missions of those institutions, by adding 
the task of public engagement and public involvement to the more closed modes of 
interaction between scientists and policymakers (see, e.g. Joss & Bellucci, 2002). 
TA here has been part of the “participatory turn” in the 1980s that have been attested 
to S&T policymaking in general (Jasanoff, 2007). 
A third relevant problem, that must always be addressed and fostered via institu-
tional means, is the provision of access to the necessary expertise to address policy

228
M. Ladikas et al.
problems with reliable scientiﬁc knowledge. Here, the perceived need for reﬂex-
ivity has been part of TA’s raison d’etre. Uncertainties of scientiﬁc knowledge with 
regard to practical and deeply political problems must be dealt with, and unavoidable 
conﬂicts of expertise have to be taken into account. Interdisciplinarity and transdisci-
plinarity make up the necessary working mode of TA institutions. This translates into 
relevant staff recruitment as well as the development of procedures to broaden the 
scope of expertise in TA projects via regular exchanges with the scientiﬁc community 
(also including non-scientiﬁc expertise from stakeholders). 
All this has led to different “models” of institutionalisation of TA, with different 
mixes of their academic/scientiﬁc, political and public “legs”—i.e. different deﬁni-
tions of the role of public, political, and scientiﬁc actors within the TA process (for 
a discussion regarding parliamentary TA institutions see Van Est, 2019). A descrip-
tion of the development of the debates on these dimensions of institutionalisation is 
beyond the focus of this chapter. It is however clear that entering into debates about 
how to organise TA on a global level will necessarily lead to thinking about models 
of institutionalisation that answer the question relating to politics, the public and 
science, in productive ways. 
The state of TA activities and their institutionalisation differs greatly across 
the world. As found in this book (Hahn et al., this volume) and in the individual 
Country Reports (see Supplement section, this volume), especially outside of the 
established European TA context, developments and initiatives show a wide range 
of modes of institutionalisation of TA-like activities. In broad terms, these can be 
localised according to politics, science, and public, showing the different emphasis 
of country activities. Networks, TA agencies and ofﬁces, as well as academic 
departments provide the spaces for TA-like efforts and frame these accordingly. 
Yet despite this heterogeneity, the core of TA is visible throughout the different 
national contexts: assessments of potential risks of emerging technologies, moving 
towards more responsibility in research and development, addressing issues of public 
trust and acceptance as well as STI governance. Furthermore, similarities can be 
found regarding which technologies are the centre of attention: AI, digitalisation, 
health- or biotechnologies. There seem to be common challenges accompanying 
these technologies, even if there are speciﬁc national systems of dealing with them. 
Regarding the processes of TA institutionalisation, the Country Reports show 
that the realms of academia, research and science provide a fertile ground in which 
expertise and methodological development can grow. Capacity building through 
(academic) TA studies and international exchange is another important aspect 
regarding potential institutional representation of TA. This in turn highlights the 
importance of a networked and adaptable character of global TA, especially to support 
countries with little or precarious TA-like activities in sustainable ways. As the history 
of TA shows, its institutionalisation also depends on factors outside of its inﬂuence 
and control (e.g., political commitment and key change agents). Therefore, the long-
term aim of actual institutionalisation may not be realistic in many countries, which 
then implies that the efforts of the globalTA Network and speciﬁc bi-or multilateral 
projects must be advanced.

3 
Models for a Global TA 
The deﬁnition of TA that permeates the book is that developed by Bütschi et al. 
(2004): 
Technology assessment is a scientiﬁc, interactive, and communicative process that aims to 
contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and 
technology. 
This deﬁnition clearly stipulates three key aspects for the development of TA: 
research (i.e. scientiﬁc), participation (i.e. interactive), and impact (i.e. communica-
tive). Every approach to TA, regardless of the context in which it is to be found, 
should reﬂect these three aspects. This refers to formal structures in TA, since types 
of “informal TA” are also widely practised. These are practises that involve exclu-
sively the public sphere and the public debate on STI, not focusing on scientiﬁc 
research, but rather on bottom-up grassroots public participation. As van Est and 
Hennen point out in this volume, these types of TA require further reﬂection about 
the extent to which there is an international or even global public sphere or debate. 
Having this caveat in mind, we have attempted to summarise the ideas developed 
in this book, in a typology of global TA that can take different key forms. We suggest 
four possible models that TA can follow in order to achieve a global presence. Each 
model includes a set of challenges and opportunities, as discussed in the contributions 
to this book. 
Model 1: Internal Globalisation of Existing National TA Capacity 
This concerns countries with existing TA capacity but limited to the speciﬁc context. 
Like the nation-state and national public spheres, national TA has become a site of 
globalisation. The observable development of national TA capacities and projects 
being increasingly concerned with issues of global reach, can be called internal 
globalisation. Based on the all-affected principle, globalisation forces national TA to 
broaden its ﬁeld of view. Internal globalisation can affect the scientiﬁc and techno-
logical developments to be studied, and the inclusion of groups world-wide which 
are affected by those developments. 
Such a model represents perhaps the easiest and most straightforward possibility 
to implement a global approach to TA issues, as it can build on existing institutional 
infrastructures. National TA capacities increase their awareness of the global nature 
of issues they are dealing with and thus increase their capacities and motivation for 
transnational TA cooperation. The argumentation for the need for global TA details 
the existing interdependencies and global effects of STI developments (see Hennen 
et al., introductory chapter, this volume). As such, there is an inherent need to perform 
TA studies that go beyond the national state-of-the-art, even if they are only targeting 
national audiences. This might in turn necessitate input from transnational sources 
and implementation of methodologies at international level. This type of TA can be 
described as “global” in the sense that it has a global perspective. It should be noted 
that in the case of the European Union, the interdependencies between Members 
States run so deep that it is virtually impossible to perform a “national” TA study

230
M. Ladikas et al.
without integrating the full aspect of multilateral governance represented by the EU, 
a factor reﬂected in the foundation of EPTA in the 1990s. 
Moreover, there is clear evidence that a sizeable part of the young generation 
consider themselves to be citizens of the world, in a trend that is characterised as an 
“internal globalisation of the public sphere” (see van Est & Hennen, this volume). 
This trend alone would necessitate the development of a globalised national TA, 
simply to make it relevant to the main preoccupations of the national citizenry. 
Perhaps the most prominent example of such TA is the issue of climate change. 
It is a truly global issue that is very salient for most people around the world, and 
requires concerted national analysis and action. A TA study on STI-based resolutions 
to climate change, will inevitably be global in scope. 
Model 2: Strengthening National TA Capacities Across the World 
This concerns countries with weak or non-existent TA capacity. Global TA can grow 
by strengthening the TA capacity of developing countries across the world. Moreover, 
although TA has been typically developed in democratic countries, strengthening TA 
capacity in authoritarian states is also a route towards global TA. 
This model represents an implicit acceptance of deep structural differences 
between developed and developing countries in terms of STI development and public 
debates on related issues. Such a view should be taken with caution; although we can 
see clear gaps in STI education and output (see Ladikas and Stamm, this volume), 
we tend to overlook the potential of distinctive systems of local STI development 
and debate such as those involved in “frugal innovation” (see Srinivas and van Est, 
this volume). It is therefore advisable to approach the issue of capacity building from 
a mutual-learning perspective. There is no doubt that many (but not all) developed 
countries have considerable experience in TA implementation, covering the whole 
spectrum of methodologies, from the standard expert-based analysis to fully partici-
patory scrutiny. There is scope in providing information and training to countries that 
do not have such experiences, in addition to providing advice on the possible institu-
tional location of TA. On the other hand, the typical TA in industrialised countries is 
not geared to incorporating parameters that describe developing country constraints. 
For instance, severe funding restrictions, policy dependencies from external actors, 
or the role of international organisations and expert expatriate communities, are not 
normally accounted for in TA. Such an expansion would require “reverse” capacity 
building from developing to developed countries. 
Another aspect that this model brings to the fore is that of political system differ-
ences amongst the various TA collaborating countries. This is an issue that has 
been discussed extensively within global TA (see Hahn & Ladikas, 2019). A short 
answer would argue for prescribed limitations on how “non-democratic” the country 
requesting the implementation of TA is. What has been called the “TA Habitat” is a 
vital feature for the development of any type of TA (Hennen & Nierling, 2015). It is 
without doubt true that the concept of TA as it developed in the Western world “has 
politics”, in the sense that its mission and self-understanding is closely tied to the 
democratic values of scientiﬁc independence and open and inclusive public deliber-
ation of policy issues (Hennen & Ladikas, 2019). This encompasses the necessary

231
preconditions for the implementation of TA, one of which is the possibility for an 
open dialogue on STI issues. Regardless of the perceptions that exist for any regime 
around the world, if it allows for a public dialogue, then TA can in principle grow 
in it. Restrictions on the dialogue might exist, and they might even be related to the 
standard norms of behaviour in the country (e.g. strong hierarchies), but as long as 
they allow for the expression of honest views on the subject, they can be acceptable. 
As such, the political limitations for the development of TA are demarcated, in the 
sense that TA would at least develop niches of open debates within the public sphere. 
Model 3: Institutional Networks Across Borders 
To stimulate the internationalisation of TA, existing national TA institutes may 
collaborate across borders on various TA-related topics. This so-called Institu-
tional Network option aims to establish an expert-and-participatory TA capability by 
connecting an appropriate set of independent, non-partisan and non-proﬁt organisa-
tions into an international network. Examples of existing networks are EPTA and the 
globalTA Network. Cooperation between institutes may vary from bilateral cooper-
ation to cooperation on a global scale, like for example in the World Wide Views on 
Global Warming4 (WWViews) project. 
This model represents the existing “status quo” of global TA. EPTA is a loose 
network of established parliamentary TA institutes, mainly from Europe but recently 
also accepting non-European countries as associated members to the network. It 
functions as an information exchange, by e.g. providing a searchable database with 
TA reports developed by members, and also organizes an annual conference for 
members, under the auspices of a rotating presidency of the network. EPTA is there-
fore a good example of how similar TA institutes can form an international network, 
but this does not translate into common projects or standardisation of TA approaches. 
So far, there has been only a limited number of TA projects under the auspices of 
EPTA, since the network does not have its own research funds. However there have 
been many European TA projects in recent decades (mainly funded by the Euro-
pean Commission) which would not have been established without the strong ties of 
exchange that have been developed in the EPTA network (EuropTA, TAMI, GEST, 
PACITA).5 
A similar structure is to be found in the globalTA Network. It is also a loose 
network of TA institutes, with the difference that it intentionally covers the whole 
world. It also requires that members formally accept a mission statement that clearly 
describes TA as6 : 
• dealing with technology and socio-technical developments 
• interdisciplinary and multi-perspective 
• policy-oriented (targeting political and societal addressees) and problem-oriented 
(addressing real-world issues)

M. Ladikas et al.
• neutral and independent (non-partisan, not funded by interest groups). 
The mission statement also describes the aims of the network and the obligations 
of its members. This represents a step towards the creation of a permanent structure 
of engagement in the area of TA, but is still far from achieving it. As with EPTA, 
the globalTA Network does not have its own funds to initiate TA projects at global 
level, and it does not have a legal entity to apply for funds. There is no doubt that 
the achievement of global TA via such networks will necessitate these steps. But one 
should not underestimate the impact that EPTA and the globalTA network have on 
promoting TA on the international stage. Without the existence of such international 
networks, TA would not normally have the chance to transform its functions from 
the national to the international level of analysis and policy advisory. 
Model 4: Global TA Linked to a Global Decision-Making Body 
National parliamentary TA organisations are often linked to a decision-making body, 
like the parliament. This decision-making body option can also be implemented on 
the global level, in particular with regard to UN institutes. In the ﬁeld of global 
warming, the IPCC is an example of this model. 
This model of global TA represents a truly global structure with a global outreach. 
It is the most ambitious of the four models and also the most challenging. We have 
seen throughout this book that TA linked to a global decision-making body is not an 
uncommon vision for the future of global TA. Two chapters have speciﬁcally used 
the example of the IPCC as a case study for global TA (see Ashworth and Clarke, 
Ladikas and Stamm, this volume). There are very good reasons for approaching a 
possible structure of global TA from this perspective. Global TA deals with global STI 
challenges and it is natural that it should be located as a global decision-making body. 
But simultaneously, TA practitioners should represent as many countries as possible 
in order to allow for a fair and globally effective strategy or intervention. It is hard 
to think of any other institutional structure that accommodates global representation 
than the typical UN paradigm. 
The challenges identiﬁed for such a possibility are many and signiﬁcant. One that 
is shared with any other institutional TA arrangement across the world, is its relation-
ship to policymaking. We are witnessing a great variety of policy locations in existing 
TA institutions, from internal bureaus in the national legislative branch that are run by 
policymakers and funded directly by public funds, to external STI advisories that are 
self-regulated and self-funded. There are major pros and cons associated with each 
institutional location, which have been extensively discussed (Decker & Ladikas, 
2004). IPCC’s location is to be found between the two sides, whereby the strategy 
and funding are a combination of governmental needs and scientiﬁc self-regulation. 
An institution performing global TA could not be differently located than IPCC. TA 
is by deﬁnition a consultative process to the policy making but should also have 
certain freedom of action in order to provide independent analysis and advice. Such 
freedom of action is not found elsewhere in the typical UN institutional system. As 
such, IPCC offers indeed a pragmatic possibility.

The Shape of Global Technology Assessment
233
Another challenge is to be found in the scientiﬁc representation of a global 
decision-making body. Here, a global TA would be faced with the inevitable imbal-
ance that exists between developed and developing countries in terms of scientiﬁc 
education and output. A TA that is based on concrete peer-reviewed science is a TA 
that would take the bulk of its input from very speciﬁc STI-intensive economies. 
There are ways to inﬂuence this input imbalance, from activating expatriate scien-
tiﬁc communities to funding speciﬁc projects in countries with weak STI systems. 
These are long-term processes that cannot be effective in creating immediate input, 
but only a global institutional arrangement can deal with such challenges in the long 
term. 
Furthermore, a main challenge for such a model would be the manner in which 
TA methodologies are implemented in different cultural contexts. This refers mainly 
to participatory and interactive methods that are well-established in most Western 
countries but have not yet been tried extensively in other cultures. Although it is 
clear that public debates on STI issues are evident across the globe (see van Est & 
Hennen, this volume), it is far from clear that participatory methodologies can be 
applied equally well in every country. Cultural speciﬁcities, norms of behaviour and 
political context, are some key elements that global TA must take into consideration. 
This is particularly important for a TA that is closely located to a centralised global 
decision-making structure. If TA is to provide the ground for consensual decision-
making, everyone must be content with the way it is applied in their national context. 
This is a challenge, but also a unique opportunity to initiate global debates which are 
both based on and promote global citizenship. Some of the (little) experience that 
TA has accumulated in this area (see World Wide Views, above) is very promising 
for the potential of globally implemented participatory methodologies.

Next Steps for the GlobalTA Network 
Having discussed the various models that the global TA could follow, we provide 
some insights as to the development of the network itself. Irrespective of the manner 
in which TA can embrace multilateralism, there are certain steps inherent in its 
development. Notwithstanding the achievement of having created a global network, 
the next steps should involve: 
The development of global projects; the practise of global TA can only be 
attained by actually running TA projects which encompass at least the majority of the 
Network membership. This means agreeing on common methodological approaches, 
timelines and frameworks for results comparison. This is a very complex and expen-
sive process that so far has not been realised due to funding constraints. An alternative 
could be a more modest comparative approach, using existing institutional funds. But 
without this step, there can of course be no global TA approach. 
Information exchange; a network is foremost a structure of information 
exchange. Like EPTA, that lacks extensive project implementation but offers a plat-
form for extensive exchange of national project results, global TA could also develop

234
M. Ladikas et al.
its own information exchange platforms. Although a less demanding step than the 
common project one above, it will still require dedicated staff for this purpose, and 
internal funds. 
Legal institutionalisation; as we have seen, there are different ways in which TA 
has been institutionalised in different countries. The globalTA Network will require 
a legal entity if it is to develop in a coherent TA practise group. This is far from 
simple, as multilateral institutions require backing by national authorities in order to 
become legal entities. But this is necessary in order for the Network to acquire the 
capacity to bid for project funds, pay staff and be represented on the global stage. 
Long-term funding; this is of course another necessary aspect for the globalTA 
Network. One possibility is to follow the IPCC model and require an annual fee from 
the institutes and scientists that comprise the network. In this manner, the network 
can safeguard its independence and acquire a secretariat to ensure basic functions. 
The role of the UN; as we have seen, UNCTAD is the UN organisation with a 
remit to perform TA and outreach to the whole globe. It is evident that the globalTA 
Network has a lot to gain by working with UNCTAD while the opposite is also true. 
Such mutually beneﬁcial relationships can be formalised with a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) that establishes a working relationship whereby the network 
can run TA projects on behalf of UNCTAD. 
Overall, there is signiﬁcant potential for development in the globalTA Network. 
How far this development can go depends not least on the necessity to have such a 
network on the global STI stage. We believe that this is indeed the case. This book 
is another step in developing the globalTA network, as it provides the conceptual 
structure upon which the practise of global TA will be built. It is now time to make 
the leap from theory to practise.

Australia: Speciﬁc Context 
As in the rest of the world, the nature of Australian society, industry, and environment 
are shaped by how we develop and apply science and technology. In Australia, there 
is a clear commitment by the national government to ﬁnding science and technology 
solutions for complex challenges, and as a key driver of innovation and economic 
prosperity (Lacey et al., 2019). Formal processes of technology assessment (TA) are 
currently applied in the Australian Government’s health system to ensure the safety 
and efﬁcacy of health technologies for market regulation and to assess the safety, 
clinical- and cost-effectiveness of various health technologies. National agencies 
have also applied TA processes to examine and compare cost estimates for electricity 
generation technologies. More recently, these energy technology assessments have 
shifted toward energy security assessments, so that risks to adequacy, reliability, and 
affordability of energy in Australia can be used to better plan for future energy needs. 
Australia has long embraced technological solutions to enhance the production of its 
primary industries and resources sectors. 
For the most part, the consideration of science and technology applications by 
government in Australia has been managed by sector, through either formal processes 
(e.g., Health TA), regulatory agencies (e.g., Ofﬁce of Gene Technology Regulator), or 
national standards (e.g., Food Standards Australia New Zealand). However, private 
industry and multinational companies also develop and drive how technologies are 
being taken up and shape Australian society. Developments such as the collection and

use of signiﬁcant datasets mean that technologies are increasingly reaching further 
into our daily lives for a variety of purposes. Some developments in technologies and 
their applications are also posing potential new societal and ethical challenges. Such 
areas of future science and technology and their impacts have become the subject of 
increasing attention in Australia. 
Australia: Developing a National Research Capability 
in Responsible Innovation 
New science and technologies provide signiﬁcant opportunities to generate public 
and private beneﬁts in our lives. Such beneﬁts may be realized through the evolution 
of tailored healthcare systems, in improvements to security and crime prevention 
systems to protect our privacy, in realizing more sustainable energy solutions for 
the future, or in demonstrating new ways to protect signiﬁcant environmental assets 
such as the Great Barrier Reef. However, new science and technologies can also 
pose ethical, social, and regulatory challenges, which if left unresolved, may hinder 
the progress and innovation that can be delivered to society and future generations. 
In the recognition that advances in science and technology are increasingly, and in 
some instances purposefully, intended to be disruptive, there has been heightened 
attention leveled at what constitutes responsible research and innovation in Australia 
(Ashworth et al., 2019). 
While the concept of responsible innovation (RI) has been used extensively in 
Europe, and to some extent in the United States, for over a decade, its adoption in the 
Australian context is a comparatively recent phenomenon. RI was ﬁrst expressed in 
a programmatic way within Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth 
Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The CSIRO is the largest of 
the publicly funded research agencies in Australia, with a mission to solve the greatest 
challenges through innovative science and technology and catalyze collaborations 
that will boost Australia’s innovation performance. In 2016, CSIRO launched a new 
research program of Future Science Platforms, which represents one of the largest 
investments in future-facing scientiﬁc research currently underway. Over time, this 
investment has grown to represent a diverse research portfolio that includes future 
manufacturing, synthetic biology applications, quantum computing, and develop-
ment in health and medical technologies, among others (CSIRO, 2021). Many of 
these ﬁelds draw on the increased computational power of digital data and machine 
learning to drive new predictions and industry developments in all aspects of our 
lives. 
Such transformational research intends to produce disruptive technologies, which 
in turn precipitate societal change and uncertainty. Given the intentionally disruptive 
nature of the research portfolio, it was recognized that assessing the risks, beneﬁts, 
and uncertainties of these areas of science and technology development was required 
in order to ensure that responsible science and technology was being designed and

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
239
delivered for all Australians. This also required an ability to design for and be respon-
sive to the social context and the end users of the research. Comprehensively assessing 
the beneﬁts, risks, and uncertainties that new and disruptive science and technologies 
present for society has emerged as a challenge around the world. 
Since 2019, RI has been adopted in the national science agency as an approach to 
this challenge. RI is funded as a Future Science Platform in its own right as opposed 
to being embedded as a cross-cutting capability. In this way, ensuring responsible 
science and technology development is itself considered to be a critical long-term 
scientiﬁc pursuit, with the requirement to demonstrate how it can be advanced through 
applied scientiﬁc research and experimentation, which is also subject to scientiﬁc peer 
review. The development of the Australian RI program drew heavily on the work of 
European colleagues. For example, the development of the program’s ten-year impact 
pathway for delivering RI for Australian science and technology development was 
reﬁned with the input of experienced colleagues in Germany, Finland, Norway, and 
the United Kingdom, along with those in the Australian research and innovation 
sector. The advantage of drawing on the lessons of global colleagues allowed ideas 
that had been trialed and challenges that had been experienced in other contexts to 
inform the design of the Australian research program. The most signiﬁcant design 
decision as a result of this consultation was to launch a research program that would 
support experimentation across different portfolios of science to identify what worked 
and what did not. This required identifying collaborators who were equally open to 
and motivated by RI outcomes, and it replaced the original model of designing a 
top-down RI framework and seeking to apply it across the entire organization. 
The funding within the national science agency was also used to establish new 
collaborations on RI with three Australian universities. This approach not only 
embeds a broader reach for RI research across Australia but also demonstrates the 
willingness of universities to invest their own funds in building a stronger base in RI 
capability. The collaborations are based on 50:50 matched funding arrangements and 
host jointly funded early career researchers who are provided with the experience of 
working across both applied and academic research environments. The intent is to 
seed and strengthen collaborative networks among the early career researchers and 
their host organizations that will test and validate RI research and its application over 
many years to come. 
Australia: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
The development of an applied research capability in RI and its application to diverse 
technologies represents one recent and formal cross-sectoral approach to advancing 
TA in Australia. However, the results of this experimentation with developing new, 
applied approaches to RI through ‘blue sky’ research investment are not yet conclu-
sive. The main challenge currently relates to drawing together initial research ﬁnd-
ings across a diverse range of projects and portfolio applications to identify what 
has worked and why, and what is most likely to translate to an applied approach to

240
Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
RI that can be taken up and used by a range of stakeholders or end users within and 
beyond the research sector. The effort to date has largely been focused on stakeholder 
engagement and constructive TA approaches. 
In the immediate term, there is evidence of the importance of drawing on global 
lessons and trends for Australian-speciﬁc application. Recent research combining 
Indigenous Knowledge and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to improve environmental 
management outcomes in Northern Australia has been a case in point and has shown 
how approaching TA at the regional and community scale will always be of critical 
importance (McDonald et al., in press). However, these developments do not happen 
independently of global research and technology trends. In the broad domain area of 
digital agriculture for example, the Australian research on responsible digital agri-
cultural systems has been developed in the context of Australian agriculture, but has 
been highly inﬂuenced and remains closely connected to international scholarship, 
industry, and governance practices (Fleming et al., 2021). 
In Australia, it is recognized that there is also a need to manage the tension 
between creating a research capability in RI, which is used within research settings 
by and for researchers, and how and what might be translated into professional and 
policy settings by other stakeholders charged with managing innovation processes. 
While this research program in Australia is still early in its delivery, it emphasizes the 
importance and positive inﬂuence of being part of a global and connected network 
of researchers and practitioners working with the changing nature and impact of 
technologies (such as the globalTA network). This was evident in the design of this 
national research program in RI research. However, there are lessons and experiences 
that continue to remain transferable and instructive across contexts. The importance 
of adopting a global approach also allows us to examine the increasingly globalized 
role of technologies in our lives.

Brazil: Speciﬁc Context 
Brazil is Latin America’s largest country, and the region’s most relevant economy. 
Likewise, it has the region’s most developed science, technology and innovation 
(STI) ecosystem, despite all the gaps and challenges science and technology are 
facing in the country. In 2016, for example, Gross Expenditure on Research and 
Development (GERD) totaled USD 37,705 million, with a GERD/GDP ratio of

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
241
1.24% (Reyes-Galindo & Monteiro, 2018). This is much less than the levels exhib-
ited by highly developed nations and regional leaders like China, but well above 
Latin American averages. Research is still concentrated in public institutions, espe-
cially universities and public research institutes, and a longstanding challenge has 
been to escape the ‘middle-income trap’ and spark more virtuous cycles of inno-
vation and investment associated with sustainable economic growth (Albuquerque, 
2019; Andreoni & Tregenna, 2020). Around 61% of government research and devel-
opment (R&D) spending goes to higher education, with 10% of spending going to 
agricultural and non-oriented research, respectively, 6% to industrial technology, 5% 
to infrastructure, 1% to defense, and other objectives such as environmental control, 
civilian space science, energy, exploration, and social development capturing less 
than 1% (Reyes-Galindo & Monteiro, 2018). 
Some of the main actors in the Brazilian ecosystem for STI include:
. Executive branch: Ministry for Science, Technology, Innovation and Communica-
tions, and related Ministries; regulatory agencies such as the National Petroleum 
Agency, The Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency, and the National Electric Energy 
Agency; state and municipal secretariats;
. Society: Brazilian Academy of Sciences (ABC); Brazilian Society for the Progress 
of Science (SBPC);
. Funding Agencies: National Council for Scientiﬁc and Technological Develop-
ment (CNPq); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel 
(CAPES); Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (FINEP); Brazilian 
Development Bank (BNDES); Brazilian Enterprise for Research and Industrial 
Innovation (EMBRAPII);
. STI ‘operators’: universities, federal and state STI institutes; science and tech-
nology institutions like the mixed public–private company Embrapa; technolog-
ical parks. 
Two major challenges are pressuring science and technology in Brazil currently, 
which also affect the Brazilian TA landscape: Dramatic funding cuts have been 
underway since 2015; and there is a crisis in the social contract between science and 
society, wherein a growing trend of denialism and attacks from extreme right-wing 
politicians and authorities ﬂows into an already problematic context of separation 
between science and society. While the lack of funding, which has continued for 
years, threatens local capacity to develop and assess technologies properly, the crisis 
in the relationship between experts and society also threatens established mechanisms 
of assessment. 
The crisis in funding has been happening since the 2015 recession, which was also 
combined with a severe political crisis around the impeachment of then President 
Dilma Roussef. The economic downturn was met with severe cuts in many areas, with 
science and technology being especially hard-hit. Scholarships for graduate students, 
a major motor in Brazilian science and technology, for example, have been at risk and 
unstable for years, causing both material damage and a subjective uncertainty which 
affect longer term outlooks for the country’s technology and innovation activities 
(Andrade, 2019). Not even the COVID-19 crisis turned the tide, and cuts have been

242
Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
ongoing in all areas, causing a growing outcry from scientists. The combination of 
budget cuts and negationism has been called out internationally (Hallal, 2021), but 
this trend has persisted. From 2015 to 2021, the budget for the Ministry of Science 
and Technology went from USD 1.2 billion to about USD 400 million. This is the 
lowest level in history when the size of the research community is taken into account, 
which will certainly have as yet unknown longer term effects (Escobar, 2021). 
Brazil: The Politics of Expertise 
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) can be pointed out as both a good practice 
for the Brazilian case, but also an example of the challenges mentioned above. On 
January 17, 2021, Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency, ANVISA, granted approval to 
two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. One of these is the so-called CoronaVac, 
a partnership between Brazil’s Butantan Institute and the Chinese company Sinovac 
Biotech. The other is the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, being produced locally at the 
Fiocruz Institute through a technology transfer deal. Both vaccines were approved 
under intense scrutiny and surrounded by political disputes. On April 26, 2021, 
ANVISA barred requests for the importation of the Sputnik V vaccine, produced by 
the Russian Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Touted 
as the ‘world’s ﬁrst registered vaccine’ for COVID-19,1 it has also been at the center 
of various disputes involving state governors and the federal government, again with 
ANVISA at the center of controversies. 
ANVISA is part of a system of institutions which help regulate and assess 
technologies for health, and it enjoys a positive reputation in the country. Along-
side ANVISA, Brazil’s universal health system (SUS) has also transformed the 
health technology landscape. SUS is a decentralized, universal access health system, 
mobilizing great resources and fomenting investment in medical technologies and 
HTA activities. SUS has provided universal health coverage and mass vaccination 
programs (Paim et al., 2011; Teixeira et al., 2018), which is very important in a 
very unequal country. Under the complex and decentralized SUS framework, the 
Ministry of Health established an HTA protocol (Brasil, 2016), which supports the 
activities of CONITEC (National Commission for the Incorporation of Technolo-
gies into SUS) which complements the role of ANVISA as well as other instances of 
HTA. This system, which mobilizes several highly respected experts and permanent 
technical personnel, has come under strain both due to the emergency situation posed 
by COVID-19, but also by the political challenges posed by President Bolsonaro and 
his supporters inside and outside government. 
The Coronavac vaccine has been at the center of a dispute between the Federal 
government and the state government of São Paulo; former allies, and now bitter 
enemies. This involved questioning the Chinese origin of the vaccine and questions
1 https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/. 

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
243
regarding its efﬁcacy, feeding into conspiracy theories, boosting anti-vaccine move-
ments and misinformation groups which have been very active since the 2018 election 
(Gramacho & Turgeon, 2021). 
The controversy around Sputnik V also involved political disputes. The ﬁrst nego-
tiation took place in mid-2020 between the government of the state of Paraná, in 
Southern Brazil, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), but did not go 
forward due to the complexities in the technology transfer agreement. Later, the 
vaccine became the focus of initiatives by states in Brazil’s Northeast, a poorer region 
of the country whose governors are overwhelmingly political foes of Bolsonaro.2 The 
regulatory process for this vaccine has been unusually controversial, with Gamaleya 
publicly criticizing ANVISA, and governors pressuring for faster approval given 
the pandemic emergency (Moutinho & Wadman, 2021). Albeit receiving a limited 
green light to import doses, pressures and critique continue, this time coming from 
politicians mostly associated with the left, or seen as opponents of Bolsonaro. 
Brazil: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
As discussed above, Brazil faces a crisis regarding the social place of science and 
technology in society, which affects the place of and possibilities for TA in the 
country. This expresses itself in two interrelated trends: severe budget cuts affecting 
the continuity and resilience of research in the country; and the growing trends 
of denialism and critique of science and experts by political ideologies currently in 
power. This trend has been detected and commented on previously (Reyes-Galindo & 
Monteiro, 2018) and has been associated with the problematic distancing between 
science and society: Hierarchical and technocratic forms of governing science and 
technology have roots in the modern origins of Brazilian STI systems (which grew 
tremendously during the military dictatorship of 1964–1988), but have come under 
strain recently. Calls for opening up science and technology policy therefore mean a 
revision of the social contract of research and society in order to increase engagement 
and legitimacy. 
In our current uncertain times, it is very unclear how such calls will resonate in 
the population and with policymakers. COVID-19 has forced a debate on the place 
of local technological capacity, for example when traditional institutes like Butantan 
and Fiocruz were able to produce COVID-19 vaccines locally and start developing 
their own technologies. But these examples remain the exception in a landscape of 
great instability and loss of future prospects. Our hope is that the ongoing struggle to 
consolidate the democratic gains of Brazilian post-1988 society will not let current 
instabilities threaten the major strides made since our new constitution.

Central Europe: Speciﬁc Context 
Of the three Central European countries in this section, Poland has advanced Tech-
nology Assessment (TA) activities the most and succeeded in establishing a parlia-
mentary TA ofﬁce. Czechia (Czech Republic) and Slovakia actively participate in 
(mostly European) TA projects, but are struggling to establish solid TA institutions 
formally recognized by national government (either executive or legislative branch). 
Historically, the scientiﬁc community interested in the problems of TA began 
to form in Poland as early as the 1970s. For instance, the works of Prof. Lech 
Zacher, a precursor of research and publications in this ﬁeld, became relevant. After 
the ﬁrst period of functioning as a loose group of scientists, this community found 
its institutional framework. Currently, the two leading institutions dealing with the 
issues of technical assistance in Poland are:
. The Bureau of Research of the Polish Parliament (Biuro Analiz Sejmowych, 
BAS3 ), established in 1991. BAS is the leading national institution specializing 
in legislative aspects of TA. It is the organizational unit of the Chancellery of 
the Polish Parliament (Sejm) which provides research and analytical support to 
the lower chamber of the Sejm. The main task of BAS is to draft legal opinions, 
prepare independent reports, and work out analyses upon request from individual 
MPs and parliamentary committees. Activities of BAS cover a broad spectrum of 
constitutional and legal matters, EU legislation, social and economic issues, and 
TA. BAS is also the associated member of the EPTA network.
. The Polish Association for Technology Assessment (Polskie Towarzystwo Oceny 
Technologii, PTOT4 ), registered in 2015. PTOT deals with TA from a scientiﬁc 
perspective. This organization aims to develop and popularize TA as a form of 
interdisciplinary scientiﬁc advice for broadly understood public policy. Members 
of PTOT are developing novel concepts for TA and improving research methods 
and tools used in TA. They are working to integrate scientiﬁc communities around

4 http://www.ptot.pl/. 

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
245
the idea of TA, and integration of competencies dispersed in various scientiﬁc 
disciplines. A recent brainchild of this activity is the Center for Science and 
Technology Assessment (Centrum Oceny Nauki i Techniki, CONT), which has 
been established at the John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin, and which will 
be dedicated to the axiological dimension of science and technology in Polish 
society and internationally. 
Czechia does not have an established institution dedicated solely to TA. Czech 
research teams were actively involved in European TA projects (e.g., TAMI and 
INES5 ) for the ﬁrst time in 2002. The Technology Centre of the Czech Academy of 
Sciences (TC CAS6 ), which is a leading national institution specializing in analyt-
ical and conceptual activities oriented at the area of STI, can be regarded as the ‘TA 
institution’ in Czechia. The TC Department of Strategic Studies (STRAST7 ) system-
atically develops methodologies for strategic studies and utilizes the latest ﬁndings in 
this ﬁeld to prepare conceptual background materials for the public administration 
on the European, national and regional levels. STRAST identiﬁes research prior-
ities and/or evaluates results and impacts of implemented policies. STRAST also 
develops methodologies used for its activities, such as evaluation, technology and 
impact assessment, foresight, or public engagement. In this context, TC CAS has 
been involved in UNIDO, ETAG, globalTA, as well as the Europe’s People’s Forum 
(EPF) networks and has become an observer in EPTA. 
Similarly, to Czechia, there is no proper TA institution in Slovakia. There has been 
some positive development regarding Health Technology Assessment (HTA), which 
can be regarded as a TA sister discipline, with the establishment of a national HTA 
organization at the Ministry of Health,8 but there is no similar development on the 
front of TA as such. Still, the Slovak Academy of Sciences (Slovenská akadémia vied, 
SAV9 ) can be considered as an aspiring TA institution in Slovakia. In 2013, some 
of the ﬁrst openly TA activities were in place, as the SAV Institute for Research in 
Social Communication started working on two projects dedicated to nuclear energy 
and human enhancement technologies. Furthermore, based on the guidelines of the 
European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC): Good Practice in the 
Dialogue between Science Academies and Policy Communities, SAV established a 
Science Advisory Platform in April 2016, became an observer in the EPTA network 
in the same year, and later also joined the globalTA network at the 4th European Tech-
nology Assessment Conference organized in Bratislava in 2019.10 Generally, SAV is 
mostly involved in joint projects with other European TA institution, e.g., within the 
EU Framework Programme. Stemming from the support of the international network 
of partners, SAV is continuously working to advocate for TA activities in Slovakia,

yet it lacks adequate resources both in human capital and funding in order to build 
an institutionally stable TA institution. 
Central Europe: Highlights of TA Activities 
A typical TA activity in the region of Central Europe is an international project 
involving citizen engagement (such as PACITA11 and CIMULACT12 ). Secondly, 
there is good practice of science-policy interface regarding TA topics, with different 
levels of institutionalization among countries. 
In Poland, BAS and PTOT both participated in European projects such as 
PACITA, actively testing various participatory TA methods for STI knowledge-
based policymaking. Currently, there are national and international research projects 
dedicated to:
. Educational needs of TA from the Polish perspective. This research aims to 
investigate the implications of the paradigm of TA at universities of technology. 
While pedagogical thinking in research has traditionally emphasized the issues 
of teaching about technology, reviewing it in the light of current empirical 
developments shows a niche in theories concerning TA in education.
. Future-oriented TA as a support tool for Responsible Research and Innova-
tion (RRI). As part of the research, the methods and techniques used in enterprises 
will be analyzed to reﬂect on the possible consequences of developing a given 
innovation at the design stage and generate practical, ethically acceptable, and 
socially acceptable desirable results.
. The social perception of 5G technology. The project aims to show how people 
perceive modern technologies, especially 5G technology, in the context of social 
security and opportunities and risks in social development. The theoretical model 
of the project refers to such theoretical positions in general sociology and TA, as 
well as in sociological research, which situate humans in the broader technological 
context of the information age or more broadly postulated Society 5.0. 
In Czechia, TC CAS has participated in European Framework Program projects 
such as PACITA, CIMULACT, and GoNano.13 Currently, it also works on NMP 
newcomers’ better involvement within a TA-like participatory project FIT-4-NMP.14 
TC CAS actively contributes to EPF activities for the Conference on the Future of 
Europe. Recently, TC CAS has ﬁnished a national project called RedPot15 (Reduction 
of Food Waste in Catering), where part of the project was to discuss and assess 
emerging technologies in catering for food waste reduction. Results have been further

used not only by the relevant ministries (of agriculture and environment), but also 
by some active fast food and catering chains like Hellman´s, Compass Group and 
Subway, as a practical guide for their employees all over Europe. 
Several projects that SAV implemented in Slovakia dealt with citizen engagement 
activities. European Framework Program projects include PLATENSO16 (citizen 
consultation on nuclear energy), CIMULACT (citizen consultation on research 
funding), and Human Brain Project17 (citizen consultation on artiﬁcial intelligence 
(AI)). Some SAV projects also dealt with ethical dimensions of TA in relation to 
citizen engagement. Slovak Research and Development Agency funded a project 
(NBICET), which tackled ethical aspects of nanotechnology, biotechnology, infor-
mation technology, and cognitive sciences. Within the SUPER MoRRI18 project, an 
analysis of RRI elements, including citizen engagement, has been made. 
To encourage public debate in Poland, BAS produces a few publications covering 
subjects related to current and forthcoming legislation and other matters of public 
concern. The Bureau publishes a series of short brieﬁng notes (‘Infos’) containing 
concise 4-page analyses of current social and economic issues. Research reports are 
published in the quarterly ‘Studia BAS.’ BAS assists the Sejm and its committees by 
organizing seminars and conferences on a wide range of topics. Another role of the 
Bureau is to monitor the consequences of current and future trends in technology 
development. 
In Czechia, TC CAS involvement in European TA projects has brought a signif-
icant change in the way society and policymakers perceive TA, participation, and 
public engagement, as these methods and principles are more and more visible in 
the basic STI/RDI policy strategies and programs. In line with this, TC CAS hosted 
the 1st European Technology Assessment Conference in Prague in 2013. 
Since 2016 in Slovakia, SAV has been involved in the Science meets Parliaments 
initiative organized by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Due 
to a fruitful cooperation with the Parliamentary Committee for Education, three 
panel discussions have been organized in the Parliament so far, on topics such as 
quality of education, institutionalization of TA, transnational labor mobility, and 
industry 4.0. As continuation of these activities, together with the Parliamentary 
Committee for Education, SAV organized the 4th European TA Conference titled 
‘Value-driven Technologies: Methods, Limits, and Prospects for Governing Innova-
tions’ in Bratislava in 2019. At this conference, the globalTA network was launched 
and its 1st annual meeting took place.

Central Europe: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
Typical for these three Central European countries is that, even though there are 
several institutions which carry out foresight activities, create scenarios, evaluate 
risks, and assess impacts on the environment and society, etc., these activities are 
often not coordinated, and the individual institutions rarely cooperate with each 
other. The best circumstances are in Poland, where, besides the Bureau of Research 
of the Polish Parliament, TA is actively developed primarily in academic ﬁelds, 
and PTOT is an organization that tries to unify all these different initiatives. In 
Czechia and Slovakia, the problem lies in the fact that TA activities are mainly 
carried out within individual (and mostly international) projects, and there are limited 
provisions for their continuity. Even though TA is actively used as a concept and tool 
for knowledge-based policymaking in both countries, TA is still not institutionalized 
in one organization within the government (neither for the executive nor legislative 
branch) which could support TA both in organizational and ﬁnancial aspects. This 
can be considered as a challenge in order to reach a common understanding of the use 
of TA for policymaking on a regular basis and not only as an ad hoc tool. This also 
means that the international network of partners is crucial, especially for these two 
countries. Initiatives and platforms such as the globalTA network provide a ground 
for TA in Central Europe, even though nationally its roots are not very deep in some 
countries. This global connection can be used as leverage in advocating for more TA 
activities in the region.

Chile: Speciﬁc Context 
Chile, located in eastern South America (19 million population; US$ 14,986 GDP 
per capita19 ), is a country under a presidential regime, where legislative power is 
vested in the National Congress. 
Congress is a bicameral legislature, composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the 
Senate, and integrated by a common service to both chambers, the Library (Biblioteca

del Congreso Nacional de Chile, BCN).20 Created in 1883, the Library’s mission is 
‘to support the parliamentary community in the exercise of its functions, gener-
ating information, knowledge, and specialized advisory, as well as to promote ties 
between National Congress and the citizenry, by making available to everyone the 
bibliographic, documentary, legal, and political-legislative history of the country.’ 
In order to fulﬁll the Library’s mission to provide specialized advisory functions, 
in 2007 the Parliamentary Technical Advisory Service (Asesoría Técnica Parlamen-
taria, ATP-BCN) was created. Currently, it is made up of forty researchers/advisors, 
specialized in different areas of knowledge, such as economics and law, but 
also psychology, architecture, communications, biology, political sciences, and 
engineering, among others. 
ATP-BCN advisors assist legislative committees on a permanent basis, preferen-
tially providing information on bills under debate during the legislative process, as 
well as on issues of interest to committees and members of the parliamentary commu-
nity. Most of the reports elaborated by ATP-BCN are produced on demand, and a 
large part of them contain analyses of comparative law, descriptions of comparative 
public policies, and explanations of technical aspects subject to regulation and their 
relation to society. 
Over the last six years, researchers/advisors within ATP-BCN have been studying 
advisory models that are closer to Technology Assessment (TA), to incorporate more 
technical and scientiﬁc information into its reports. And for the last two years, ATP-
BCN has been progressively delivering documents in line with an evidence-informed 
advisory service. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated efforts oriented toward the 
adoption of concrete and more efﬁcient evidence-informed advisory methodolo-
gies, strengthening the use of this type of documents at the request of the Chilean 
parliamentary community. 
As a result of this renewed interest for science in public debate, ATP-BCN has 
developed networks and working protocols with the scientiﬁc community, in support 
of a ﬂuent and constant collaboration between expert sources and decision-makers. 
Particular attention has been paid to limit possible biases arising in this process, as 
well as to inherent difﬁculties in the contemporary relationship between science and 
politics. All of the above activities are taking place in the midst of the current drafting 
of a new Chilean constitution, and more than a decade of water droughts that have 
severely impacted the country’s territory. 
Chile: Highlights of TA Activities 
Responding to inquiries from members of Congress is one of ATP-BCN’s main 
activities, whether through comparative law documents or legislative/public policy 
reports from a sectoral point of view. Also, ATP-BCN researchers/advisors respond
20 Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile. Available at https://www.bcn.cl/portal/. 

250
Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
to technical questions on a wide array of matters, such as connectivity, health, agricul-
ture, ﬁsheries, defense, labor market, family, education, and international relations. 
These responses are sent via documents, emails, presentations before committees, 
or even by phone. Notwithstanding the delivery support mechanism, any informa-
tion provided by BCN-ATP must always comply with the same standards: quality, 
impartiality/neutrality, and opportunity. 
To improve our internal processes, ATP-BCN has been working on several strate-
gies to enhance certain skills, through: (1) internal workshops on evidence-informed 
legislation, (2) international networking with international parliamentary advisory 
organizations (EPTA Network, globalTA, and INGSA) as well as with local scholars, 
universities, and the national scientiﬁc community, (3) design and implementation 
of original documents with new and replicable advisory methodologies, and (4) 
strengthening assistance and support to specialized congressional committees on 
science and technology matters. 
Current global challenges, like climate change, radical and accelerated advances 
in technology, and the need to comply with the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), have shown the urgency of incorporating new support channels 
for decision-makers through frontier evidence-based documents. These documents 
inform Congress members on related changes and potential effects for Chile, many 
of which, due to their novelty, are not yet widely regulated around the world. 
As in other countries with parliamentary advisory experience, in Chile, as previ-
ously mentioned, ATP-BCN has worked under the concept of ‘Technology Assess-
ment,’ by building instruments, practices, and networks that, as a whole, represent 
a concrete advance in how to integrate scientiﬁc knowledge into the deliberative 
process of new legislation. 
Technical manuals and scientiﬁc articles recommending best practices, from insti-
tutions like the U.S. Government Accountability Ofﬁce (U.S. GAO)21 and others, 
have recently been published. However, there is still no agreement among scien-
tiﬁc advisory organizations on which methodologies, products, and processes are 
most effective to achieve the goal of providing the best information to parliaments. 
Hence, at ATP-BCN we have decided to develop our own path regarding TA-related 
documents, complementary to its traditional advisory services. 
In 2020, a new task force was created to promote TA methodologies and prod-
ucts among ATP-BCN researchers/advisors, called ‘Scientiﬁc Legislative Advisory’ 
(Asesoría Cientíﬁca Legislativa, ACL). These are:
. Frontier Reports: Six-eight page reports based on scientiﬁc, technical, and 
legislative sources, developed to answer questions from Congress committees 
on new technologies, climate change and other social and legislative issues not 
yet regulated in the world, or where actual local norms are being challenged (v.gr.

‘neurorights’22 ). This document is structured in four main parts: technical deﬁ-
nitions, real world examples, concerns from the parliamentary community, and 
potential solutions provided by science and/or foreign public policy/legislation. 
Most importantly, these kinds of reports are not only subject to internal review, 
but also by well-renowned external experts in their ﬁeld of research.
. Expert consultation: Based on the Delphi methodology, this report provides 
consolidated answers, from 10 to 15 experts, on a speciﬁc legislative issue. The 
experts’ participation is anonymous, that is, only the ATP-BCN research/advisor 
in charge knows the identity of participants, and the responses are not associated 
to their names. However, the said experts can authorize the publication of their 
names at the end of the report, and an informed consent clause indicates how the 
information from their responses will be used. The questions are speciﬁc to the 
subject matter, and the selection of such experts must meet a gender parity criteria, 
diversity of viewpoints, and academic excellence or demonstrated experience in 
case of participants from outside the scientiﬁc community. 
Also, effective networking with the members of the scientiﬁc community has 
proven crucial to the attainment of ATP-BCN’s goals on the provision of evidence-
informed advisory services. Recent collaboration agreements have been celebrated 
with the government’s National Agency of Research and Development (Agencia 
Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo, ANID), and with a Chilean universities 
consortium (Vincula). Plus, there have been informal but constant collaborations with 
other TA organizations from different countries (both extra- and intra-parliamentary 
ofﬁces), such as globalTA, the Parliamentary Ofﬁce of Science and Technology 
(POST) at the UK Parliament, ‘Ciencia al Parlamento’ (a Spanish organization 
promoting the recently created scientiﬁc advisory ofﬁce at the Congress of Deputies 
of Spain), and the Mexican chapter of the International Network for Government 
Science Advice (INGSA), and Universidad Austral of Argentina. 
Likewise, engagement with the parliamentary community is a permanent objective 
within any legislative advisory service. ATP-BCN has a long and well-established 
working relationship with committees and congressional staff. This has allowed 
ATP-BCN researchers/advisors to follow and actively participate in the legislative 
process, while maintaining a technical standing as an intra-parliamentary ofﬁce. 
In this context, ATP-BCN is working closely with the ‘Future, Sciences, Tech-
nology, Knowledge and Innovation Committee’ at the Chamber of Deputies, 
providing support on requirements regarding scientiﬁc-based information on 
four speciﬁc issues: telemedicine, distance learning education, carbon neutrality, 
and democracy and social networks. For each of these issues, an ATP-BCN 
researcher/advisor and a deputy member of committee is in charge, supported by 
the ACL task force for methodologies, identiﬁcation of specialists, and evidence 
check-up process.

Chile: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
We recognize that bringing expert knowledge into the legislative decision-making 
process requires professional and speciﬁcally designed advisory work. Bridging the 
gap between Congress members and experts, by conveying the latter’s knowledge in 
a way that makes sense in terms of legislative requirements, is as relevant as detecting 
possible biases in this process. 
With this objective in mind, it is key to develop an institutional culture of evidence-
informed advisory, by strengthening the ACL task group activities within our service, 
mainly by introducing, training, and supporting the use of the described method-
ologies in the elaboration of evidence-based documents. It is, and will continue 
to be, a learning process, improved by internal feedback and formal and informal 
development of new skills. 
All of the above examples have the sole aim of reinforcing the use of scien-
tiﬁc evidence in decision-making at the Chilean National Congress. In the end, it 
is about making better legislation for a world in constant and accelerated change, 
where international collaboration is essential to ﬁnd local solutions that bring expert 
knowledge closer to the public. Hence, the main challenge is the construction of a 
culture of evidence-informed policy decisions, where networks such as globalTA are 
a lighthouse; a node where national experiences converge. In the path of developing 
this culture of evidence-informed policy decisions, the institutionalization of the 
described mechanisms can help to democratize knowledge and, hopefully, improve 
citizens’ quality of life.

China: Speciﬁc Context 
Governance in the ﬁeld of science, technology, and innovation (STI) has long been 
regarded as a critical area of STI policy research in China. However, there are still 
few explicit technology assessment (TA) publications from China. RRI (Responsible 
Research and Innovation), a relevant research term for TA, has been a rapidly growing 
research domain in China. Chinese researchers have developed RRI as a research 
concept of governance in terms of China’s development in science, technology, 
innovation, and society (Zhao & Liao, 2017).

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
253
Currently, more Chinese researchers are concentrating their efforts on the gover-
nance of STI. Chinese researchers are also trying to apply methodologies of gover-
nance that include TA, RRI, sustainability research (SR), etc. For instance, the 
research team from Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Develop-
ment (CASTED) participated in the ERC Horizon 2020 research project ‘Respon-
sible Research & Innovation in practice’ to introduce RRI as a governance research 
concept to case studies in China.23 The concepts of TA, RRI, and SR have been incor-
porated into governance research on topics such as research ethics, open science, 
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), the digital economy, and sustainability (Mei et al., 2017). 
China: Highlights of TA Activities 
Research ethics is a critical component of RRI research in China. With the rapid devel-
opment of science and technology in China, research ethics and integrity have become 
major issues for a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, the public, business, 
and government. Research concepts from RRI open up new avenues of inquiry for 
Chinese researchers and policymakers. To address the uncertainties inherent in the 
development of STI, public administration, university, and research institutes are 
employing RRI concepts such as open access, public engagement, and reﬂexivity. 
For instance, NSFC and CAS have already released open access policies.24 
In China, the concept of open science has grown in popularity in recent years. 
Scientiﬁc research institutions, researchers, and government have participated in 
discussions about open science issues such as open access, open data, and open 
peer review (Huang et al., 2020). Additionally, Chinese researchers have a more 
favorable view of open data and open access. Numerous studies have demonstrated 
that combining open science concepts and RRI improves communication and trust 
among a diverse range of stakeholders, including the public, industry, universities, 
research institutions, and government. Open science practice and development will 
contribute to the improvement of China’s scientiﬁc research environment and the 
further transparency of scientiﬁc research. 
According to related research, RRI has been considered among the most signiﬁ-
cant motivating factors in advancing the use of AI in industry policymaking, privacy 
protection, education, and innovation. China’s AI-relevant technologies and appli-
cation scenarios have experienced a signiﬁcant increase in innovation. Both policy-
makers and researchers note that AI technology presents potential risks for society 
(Guo & Liu, 2019). RRI and TA concepts have been applied to China’s AI research 
and development (R&D) process (Li & Chen, 2020). The concept of responsible AI

with a research ethics perspective has been employed in national level policy.25 RRI 
offers a new ethics research perspective into China’s AI development. 
The digital economy is a signiﬁcant domain of China’s economy. Responsibility 
has been taken into consideration in both research policy and practice as an essential 
motivation for the digital economy. Although RRI is still a research concept, it offers 
the dynamic process of revealing the ‘black box’ of digital technologies by providing 
the perspective of reﬂexivity. Meanwhile, RRI contributes to the development of the 
digital economy by increasing transparency and protecting personal privacy. When it 
comes to the digital economy, an online platform is a conduit for social responsibility. 
To achieve responsible innovation for platform governance, it is critical to have 
open and transparent communication for multi-stakeholders. Meanwhile, an online 
platform provides a collaborative interface for a variety of stakeholders (Huang et al., 
2019). 
Sustainable development has also been introduced into China’s practice of public 
policy, as well as industrial policy. China’s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan (2021–2025) 
emphasizes the importance of sustainability. As stated in China’s Government Work 
Report (2021), the country’s primary goal is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, 
with a target of reaching a CO2 emissions peak before 2030.26 In China, SR has 
introduced a positive trend in interdisciplinary research. SR covers multiple disci-
plines such as environmental science, ecology, economics, management, sociology, 
and policy science. 
China: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
In order to keep up with China’s rapid development of science and technology, TA as a 
research concept still needs to be developed. There are still fewer empirical studies of 
quantitative and qualitative analysis in China’s current RRI research. The governance 
of emerging technologies has been considered as a grand societal challenge for 
China’s development because of its potential impact on society. Collaboration and 
knowledge exchange between China and other countries are required for emerging 
research topics in the TA domain. Chinese researchers are trying to develop RRI 
research that is based on the comparison of best practices from different countries and 
areas. The globalTA network could be a knowledge exchange platform for Chinese 
research. However, for Chinese researchers, there are still fewer international peer-
reviewed journals to present the best practice from China in the domain of RRI, TA, 
and SR. Grand societal challenges necessitate the development of a new governance 
research paradigm in order to achieve policy practices that are sufﬁcient, efﬁcient, 
and appropriate.

India: Speciﬁc Context 
The Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), under 
the Department of Science and Technology, is the primary TA organization in India. 
TIFAC has been doing important work like developing the ‘Technology Vision 2035’ 
or supporting mission mode programs and innovation-related programs with regard 
to intellectual property rights, micro-, small-, and medium enterprises, technology 
development, and commercialization. However, there are other organizations that 
are working on TA, broadly deﬁned, and recently Health Technology Assessment 
(HTA) has gained prominence. TA practices in India are varied, but there is no central 
agency that co-ordinates TA activities. Many agencies claim that they are doing TA, 
although there is no clarity on methodologies. 
As India embarks upon harnessing emerging technologies like quantum technolo-
gies, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), and genome editing, there is an urgent need to pay 
attention to TA. The Technology Policy Statement of 1983 deﬁned TA as mecha-
nisms consisting of ‘competent groups (which) will render advice in all cases of 
technology import relating to highly sophisticated technology, large investments and 
national security,’ and this later resulted in the formation of TIFAC. However, as 
Pandey and Sharma (2020) have pointed out the visions relating to science, tech-
nology and innovation (STI) in India from ofﬁcial agencies have often been based 
on the deﬁcit model of Public Understanding of Science (PUS). As a result, TA 
is limited to such an approach rather than becoming rooted through participatory 
TA or constructive TA. The only initiative that has resembled participatory TA was 
on Bt Brinjal (a genetically engineered variety of aubergine), which resulted in the 
government declaring a moratorium on Bt Brinjal. 
Given the range of government ministries and departments that deal with STI in 
India, from space to industrial/applied research, atomic energy to agriculture, it would 
be obvious that there should be some sort of assessment of technology/innovation 
that is part of the planning process or policymaking mechanism, although it might 
not be called ‘Technology Assessment’. But in reality, there is none that could be 
classiﬁed as ‘Technology Assessment’ as normally understood. 
Given the fact that programs are evaluated and assessed, and outcomes are often 
compared with similar ones elsewhere, it is obvious that there are mechanisms to 
evaluate, assess, or study the impacts and examine the outcomes vis-à-vis the costs 
and the estimated beneﬁts. However, these are in almost all cases mechanisms that are 
internal and function as part of the respective ministries/departments, while external

256
Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
evaluation by agencies like the Comptroller and Auditor General of India is limited to 
regulatory frameworks and administrative functioning (e.g., see CAG, 2016). On the 
other hand, academic institutions and universities do not have adequate competences 
in doing TA, nor are mandated to do that. While some civil society groups are 
active in STI policy, or on technologies related to some sectors like biotechnology 
or pharmaceuticals, TA is certainly not their ‘cup of tea’. 
India: Highlights of TA Activities 
‘Technology
evaluation’,
‘impact
assessment’,
and
‘techno-economic 
study/assessment’ are some of the terms that are used in various documents 
and mandates of various institutions/programs, but these do not constitute TA. 
For example, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) evaluates the 
outcomes of various programs and initiatives for varietal development, but this is 
not TA. Instead, the varieties are assessed on the basis of yield, cost and beneﬁt, and 
economic gain to the farmer but, again, this is not a comprehensive assessment of 
either the technology or the varieties. The Department of Agricultural Research and 
Education (DARE), under which ICAR functions, differentiates between technology 
intervention, and technology assessment and reﬁnement in its activities. According 
to the Annual Report of DARE for 2017/18, there were 3,446 technology interven-
tions in 3,340 locations, with 26,029 trials conducted in the farmers’ ﬁelds, while 
in the livestock sector, 580 technology interventions were made in 584 locations, 
and 6,160 trials on animals were conducted (DARE, 2019: 107–108). The report 
lists the criteria used to assess and reﬁne. From this, it seems that thematic areas in 
assessment and reﬁnement were focused on using one or two criteria to evaluate, 
rather than to assess as is done in typical TA exercises. The report also mentions 
participatory technology development and participatory plant breeding, but these 
are not signiﬁcant in terms of numbers. 
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) has received support from the Govern-
ment of India and is emerging as an important component in decision-making on 
technologies and treatments in India. In 2017, the Government of India proposed 
setting up a Medical Technology Assessment Board (MTAB). Later, this idea was 
replaced with HTA in India (HTAIn). HTAIn comprises three organizations, HTAIn 
Secretariat, HTAIn Technical Appraisal Committee (TAC), and HTAIn Board. The 
HTAIn Secretariat collaborates with speciﬁc technical partners (TPs) and regional 
resource hubs (RRHs). The requests for HTA studies can emanate from health depart-
ments in central and state governments. The HTA study has to be comprehensive, 
including systematic literature reviews, economic evaluations, cost–beneﬁt analyses, 
measuring and valuing the health outcomes, and analyses on equity and access issues. 
Finally, a policy brief and HTA outcome report is sent to the department that requested 
the assessment. What is noteworthy, is that this has provisions for stakeholder consul-
tations in two stages; the TA studies are expected to go beyond economic assessment 
and cost–beneﬁt analysis, and thus to be comprehensive. For example, the outcome

report, ‘Health Technology Assessment of intraocular lenses for treatment of age-
related cataracts in India,’ published by the HTAIn Secretariat in July 2018, addresses 
equity issues through literature survey, compares different technological options and 
makes recommendations (Department of Health Research, 2018). 
India: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
The main challenge for TA in India is the lack of an agency to co-ordinate, standardize 
methodologies on TA, and to do capacity building. In addition, there is a lack of 
awareness of the importance of TA. The draft STI Policy mentions TA in passing in 
one sentence, although TA is very important in the case of emerging technologies 
(Department of S&T 2020). There is no speciﬁc policy or strategy on TA, and while 
HTA is gaining importance it is more like a standalone exercise than part of a national 
TA framework or strategy. The globalTA network could contribute to sensitizing on 
TA, create awareness on the importance of TA and support capacity building in TA. 
It can help in introducing new concepts and practices in TA and in contextualizing 
them for India.

Russia: Speciﬁc Context 
The process of institutionalization of TA in Russia should be considered in the wider 
historical context of a post-socialist society. On the one hand, during Soviet industri-
alization, TA-like activities were undertaken ad hoc in large-scale projects, such as 
urbanization of undeveloped areas, which had to co-ordinate the planning of produc-
tion, housing, transport, and recreation systems, trying to compensate the side-effects 
for the environment, public safety, and health. On the other hand, the social and envi-
ronmental assessment of technologies has been for a long-time specialized industry-
wise and is still to some extent encapsulated within the different agencies, yet lacks 
public participation and openness. Nowadays, the great disparities between the de-
industrialized and the hi-tech centers, and the complex problems of environment, 
infrastructures, and mobilities require systems analysis and coordinated action on a 
new level.

Russia: Highlights of TA Activities 
The most notable aspect of the current institutional context for TA activities in Russia 
is the crucial role played by the largest technical universities. Historically, they have 
closely interacted with industry through the system of targeted (employer-sponsored) 
education, cooperating with scientiﬁc institutions, and actively networking on the 
national and international levels. The structure of programs in higher technical educa-
tion allows relatively high representation of social sciences and humanities. Recently, 
the technical universities have accumulated even larger resources as the dominant 
centers of technological clusters (technoparks). A few have acquired the status of 
‘National Research Universities,’ providing state support for innovative projects, and 
a higher degree of autonomy in developing educational standards. 
An example of taking advantage of this opportunity is the development of the 
ﬁrst complete cycle of TA education (a bachelor and a master program) in Bauman 
Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU). In the last ﬁve years, the under-
graduate program, ‘Sociology of Technology and Engineering’ (https://bmstu.ru/bac 
helor/majors/sociologia-390301), was accredited and received state funding. Despite 
the necessity to ﬁt into the existing disciplinary category and the general stan-
dards of sociological education, the program pursues the wider interdisciplinary 
approach of TA and Science and Technology Studies (STS). The long-term collab-
oration between BMSTU and the Institute of Technology Assessment and Systems 
Analysis at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany (KIT-ITAS) enabled 
the organization of an orientation workshop ‘Technology—Society—Innovation in 
TA and STS research perspectives’ in 2019. Currently, the pilot master program, 
‘Social Analysis of Technological Innovations and Risks,’ is being implemented 
in BMSTU, with a perspective of further internationalization. The faculty aims to 
provide practice-oriented training, including internships in industry, opinion poll 
centers, municipal and state agencies, and media, to enrich the ﬁeld of knowledge 
regarding sociotechnical processes. 
In addition, the faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities have accumulated an 
extensive knowledge in engineering studies. In recent years, many research projects 
were focused on engineering cultures and visions, professionalization, career strate-
gies and mobility of engineers, methodologies of technical education, etc. This mate-
rial is gradually implemented in the new courses within the engineering curriculum, 
such as ‘Sociology of Technology and Engineering,’ ‘STS for Engineers,’ ‘Engi-
neering Ethics,’ and others. The coursework and individual projects have to include 
at least basic acquaintance with the TA problematic in the particular ﬁeld as a 
criteria for evaluation. In this case, the technical universities can enable ‘inter-
vention from within’ in technical thinking, and more active exchange between the 
socio-humanitarian and engineering communities. 
On the basis of the network of the largest technical universities of Moscow, Saint 
Petersburg, Tomsk, Perm, and the other regions, BMSTU has initiated the organi-
zation of the association ‘TA and STS in Russia,’ going beyond the educational 
community and bringing together academic research institutions, enterprises, and

the governmental analytical centers. The participants of the ﬁrst organizational event 
in 2019 noted that the TA-like activities under different names are dispersed in insti-
tutional and regional aspects, and that international cooperation with the European, 
Chinese, and other actors in TA is currently more pronounced than coordination on 
the national level. In general, TA is still not institutionalized in Russia and remains 
a largely foreign experience. It is necessary to elaborate an optimal, context-speciﬁc 
model of expert support for science and technology policies, and to promote the 
public discussion of sociotechnical problems. 
Russia: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
In our view, the major challenge for TA in Russia is the uneven development, 
which combines the problems of the developed and developing economies across 
the Russian regions. The rapid spread of high-tech innovations, such as e-medicine, 
platform businesses, and digitalized governmental services, is going on in parallel 
with a lack of access to the basic infrastructure, and the environmental effects of 
the extraction industries (oil, coal, iron, etc.). Potentially, this may stimulate TA to 
balance the predominant interest in the high technologies and disruptive innovations 
which is present both in public discourse and science and technology policy analysis, 
and to pay more attention to the low-cost technologies, grassroots, and frugal inno-
vations, as well as maintenance and repair studies. The ethnic and cultural diversity 
of Russia raises the problems of public perception and attribution of meaning to 
technologies, requiring the comparative perspective and contextualization of tech-
nological solutions and risks. The lack of transparency of decision-making in the 
technical processes problematizes the distribution of knowledge and responsibility 
in society, and the ways technologies may aggravate, reproduce, or reduce the existing 
inequalities. 
The globalTA network may have a large impact by demonstrating the precedents 
of successful institutionalization of TA worldwide, as well as the best practices of 
public engagement in technological solutions. It is already clear that international 
networking enables collaboration within the national expert community and helps to 
link the diverse agents (educational institutions, think tanks, enterprises, civil society 
organizations, etc.) that were institutionally demarcated.

South Africa: Speciﬁc Context and TA Activities 
Technology assessment (TA) is in its infancy in Africa. It is not as common or 
practiced and institutionalized in Africa than in other parts of the world. So far, its 
conceptualization and application have been ad hoc and largely conducted by consul-
tants as part of externally funded policy initiatives. TA has been often conceptualized 
around identiﬁcation of unintended impacts, or as cost–beneﬁt analysis of technolo-
gies and/or new infrastructure projects (e.g., roads, rail, and dams). Some aspects 
of TA have been embedded in environmental impact assessment (EIA) activities or 
programs that are now more institutionalized and legislated in many African coun-
tries. In EIAs, emphasis is often placed on environmental impacts of technologies 
or investment projects in general. Environmental protection agencies are the main 
institutional mechanisms for undertaking EIAs, and often there is less synergy or 
coordination between such processes and national STI policymaking processes.27 
The conduct and governance of EIAs tend to be increasingly participatory in most 
African countries because of the existence of legislation and citizen groups or activists 
for the protection of the environment. This is not the case for STI policy, where 
there are relatively small civil constituencies, budget deﬁcits, and weak institutional 
(particularly) executive leadership. 
TA has also been conceptualized as part of health technology and medicines 
regulatory or approval processes in some African countries. Domiciled in government 
ministries or departments of health, aspects of TA focus on assessing the side-effects 
or health risks of medicines, drugs, and other health technologies. Some of these 
efforts have been tagged or labeled ‘health technology assessment’. However, this 
is misleading because such efforts or processes do not focus on societal effects 
but are narrowly aimed at health or medical aspects of technologies. Moreover, 
they are often not linked to or do not feed into national STI policymaking. This is 
mainly because health ministries or agencies and government agencies in general 
tend to work or operate in ‘silos’, with limited synergies to each. There is also a 
tendency to rigidly deﬁne STI policy as the exclusive mandate of ministries of STI. In 
addition, ministries or departments of STI tend to be less inﬂuential or powerful in the 
organizational structure of government, and thus are less resourced and capacitated

to mobilize other government agencies to engage in multi-sectoral ways in TA, which 
is multi-disciplinary and cross-sectoral. 
Health TA has become a key part of public policy to respond to COVID-19 and 
related crises around the world. There is recognition that AI, digital innovations, and 
data science offer an array of opportunities to help effectively combat the pandemic 
and pre-empt and prevent future infectious disease epidemics in South Africa. They 
can enable health practitioners and policymakers to design and implement context-
speciﬁc interventions to trace, test, and treat COVID-19 and other viral infections. Al, 
digital innovations, and data science are pervasive and converging in unprecedented 
ways, making it possible to search for and develop treatments, exploit available 
scientiﬁc information about the pandemic and related epidemics, assist enforcement 
of containment policies, and monitor the impact of the disease on patients as well 
as on socio-economic systems. A number of countries in Africa are harnessing the 
technological and scientiﬁc opportunities to confront and manage the COVID-19 
pandemic and other infectious disease epidemics.28 
Institutional actors in research on TA and TA-like activities in Africa are mainly 
public universities. They include the University of Pretoria, University of Cape Town, 
University of KwaZulu Natal, University of Witwatersrand, Stellenbosch University, 
University of Johannesburg and University of South Africa (UNISA) in South Africa, 
Cairo University in Egypt, and Mohammed V university of Rabat in Morocco, and 
research institutes such as the Council for Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research (CSIR) 
in South Africa. 
South Africa has experimented with both expert-led top-down and multi-
stakeholder participatory biotechnology assessment initiatives. In 2001, the then 
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST) established an expert 
committee comprising of scientists from a variety of disciplines, including science 
and innovation policy, economics, and law, to provide an independent assessment 
of biotechnologies in agriculture, health, mining, and industrial applications of the 
biotechnologies, and propose to DACST and the country cabinet a national strategy 
for biotechnology. The committee had two international non-South Africa experts. 
It conducted risk and cost–beneﬁt analysis and proposed a national strategy for 
modern biotechnology. Government adopted the National Biotechnology Strategy 
in 2001. The Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) reviewed the strategy and 
developed a National Bioeconomy Strategy in 2016. 
Participatory TA has been tried through South Africa’s Public Understanding 
of Biotechnology (PUB) program, launched in early 2003 by the South African 
Agency of Science and Technology Advancement (SAASTA), funded by the National 
Research Foundation. The overall aims of PUB (www.pub.ac.za) are to build public 
awareness and understanding of biotechnology, and to promote public dialogue and 
debate on socio-economic and environmental impacts of the technology. PUB has

conducted several studies and surveys, including two assessments of public percep-
tions of biotechnology, its beneﬁts, and risks.29 In the early 2000s, PUB and the 
National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) organized public workshops and 
seminars at provincial and national levels to solicit public views on and inputs to 
biotechnology policies. 
South Africa: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
Overall, TA is in infancy, but there is high demand to institutionalize it, to be part of 
STI policy processes. As countries engage or focus on and address global and local 
challenges such COVID-19 and aim at attaining the SDGs, they need TA capacities in 
order to make appropriate technology choices. The countries are exposed to a large 
and growing body of scientiﬁc knowledge and related technological innovations 
through foreign direct investment (FDI), technology transfer, and a variety of other 
mechanisms. Again, TA capacity is needed for them to be able to wisely govern FDI 
and technology transfer for sustainable development. The study recommends that 
raising awareness, promoting sharing of information and experiences, mobilizing, 
and enhancing skills, establishing a pan-African network, strengthening institutional 
coordination and synergies, and improving policy and legislative frameworks are key 
as aspects of building TA capacity in Africa.

South Korea: Speciﬁc Context 
In South Korea, technology assessment (TA) became mandatory due to the enactment 
of the Framework Act on Science and Technology in 2001 and has been performed 
from 2003. Since then, a total of 21 TA projects and studies were successfully 
completed on various topics, such as big data, 3D printing, genome editing, and 
social robots. The main goal of South Korea’s TA is to ﬁnd the right direction, which 
is to increase positive impacts of technological development, by evaluating newly 
developed S&T’s impact on the economy, society, ethics, and the environment, and

to use these results to advise related policy planning. One of the most important char-
acteristics of South Korea’s TA is that it is performed according to a legal basis. The 
other characteristic is that the government, represented in the Ministry of Science 
and ICT (MSIT), is responsible for the TA process. The role of MSIT in the TA 
process is to discuss the annual TA plan with the Korea Institute of S&T Evaluation 
and Planning (KISTEP), which then conducts the TA process and gathers opinions 
from related government ministries. The ﬁnal TA results are reported to PACST 
(Presidential Advisory Council on Science & Technology). The report includes how 
government ministries reﬂected policy recommendations from the previous year’s 
TA. This process of reporting to PACST enables the application of TA results in 
policy settings and budget planning. 
South Korea: Highlights of TA Activities 
In this system, a TA project for one technology is conducted every year. Technology 
candidates for TA are proposed by the Technology Selection Committee, which 
consists of experts from the humanities and social sciences, as well as S&T. These 
experts are from academia, industry, etc. The Ministry of Science and ICT then 
decides on the target technology by collecting opinions from other ministries on 
the proposed technologies. KISTEP then organizes the TA Committee and a Citizen 
Forum. TA is carried out by the TA Committee made up of experts and a Citizen 
Forum made up of general citizens. The TA Committee, composed of experts in 
the ﬁeld of technology and social sciences, predicts the development of technology, 
analyzes ripple effects and issues on the economy, society, etc., and derives policy 
recommendations. The Citizen Forum discusses the impact of technology and makes 
recommendations through a citizen-participatory deliberation process. In addition, 
an online board is operated so that anyone can participate in TA (Fig. 1).

An example was the TA on genome editing technology conducted in 2015. The 
results include the following issues: potential and safety for disease treatment, embry-
onic and reproductive cell application, and quality improvement and safety of agri-
cultural and livestock products. When used to treat disease, genome editing tech-
nology can fundamentally treat genetic disorders, and also cure chronic disease like 
diabetes. From the TA results, it became clear that there are concerns about safety. 
For instance, worries about serious side-effects may occur if genetic scissors sever 
unintended DNA. There were mixed arguments for and against the application of 
genome editing technology to embryos and reproductive cells. The technology can 
treat genetic disorders but may lead to unexpected side-effects. Genome editing 
technology can improve the quality of agricultural and livestock products. However, 
it must verify whether gene-edited crops and meat are safe for humans, and also 
these products’ impact on an ecosystem should be examined. The TA Committee 
came up with the following policy recommendations through sufﬁcient discussions 
and joint meetings with the Citizen Forum. First, more in-depth research on the 
effectiveness of genome editing technology and veriﬁcation on its impacts on the 
human body are needed. Second, a consensus is especially crucial concerning the 
application of genetic scissors to embryos and reproductive cells. In addition, it is 
necessary to review and enact relevant laws and regulations. Third, a new regula-
tory framework is needed to verify the safety of products created by genome editing 
technology. Fourth, risk communication needs to be strengthened, such as providing 
communication channels for various levels and transparent information disclosure. A 
discussion contest on genome editing technology was held for high school students 
in 2017, and a seminar was held in which stakeholders, citizens, and reporters related 
to this technology participated in 2019. It is understood that social discussions on 
this technology have become more active after the TA in 2015. 
In general, before ﬁnalizing the TA results an open forum is held. In this open 
forum, which is conducted every year, not only the TA results but also South Korea’s 
TA system is explained. Based on the results of the TA process, a booklet for the 
general public is also published. The booklet plays a role in raising interest in the TA 
system as well as the speciﬁc technology. In the case of genome editing technology, 
there was a discussion forum to review the results of TA ﬁve years later. In this 
forum, the TA results and policy recommendations were reviewed, and utilization 
of the technology and related regulations were discussed. It was discussed that the 
difference between genome editing technology and GMOs should be explained more 
to the public. The public should be more engaged in policymaking. And there was 
an opinion that the government should have been more active in policy-setting after 
the TA.

South Korea: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
Based on the experience of TA in South Korea for the past 18 years, the direction 
of future development has begun to be considered. A possible development plan for 
TA is proposed in the following three aspects. 
First, simpliﬁcation of the TA process should be considered to evaluate multiple 
technologies each year. TA can be simpliﬁed by adjusting the scope of target tech-
nology or assessment, performing only expert committee evaluation, or operating 
only a Citizen Forum. As new technologies appear faster and the impacts of those 
technologies on society are getting bigger, it seems better to conduct TA for several 
technologies to achieve the role of TA. 
The second is to raise the awareness of TA. Since TA has been carried out for 
nearly 20 years, the general public’s awareness of TA has increased. As a result, the 
number of people who apply to participate in the Citizen Forum is increasing every 
year, although the number of applicants increases for more familiar technologies, 
such as artiﬁcial intelligence. However, various methods such as new media should 
be used to strengthen the publicity of the TA process and results. 
Finally, it is necessary to consider ways to diversify the operational method of the 
Citizen Forum according to the characteristics of the target technology. The Citizen 
Forum is composed of about 15 citizens considering age, gender, and region. In the 
ﬁrst meeting, citizens get to know the TA system and increase their awareness of the 
target technology. After that, through two rounds of discussion, recommendations 
are made by the citizens. In addition, mutual opinions are exchanged through a joint 
meeting with the Expert Committee. Regardless of the type of target technology, the 
Citizen Forum has always been operated according to this procedure. The result of 
the Citizens Forum ends with a citizen’s report. However, it is also worth considering 
reducing the effort of citizens to write reports. Instead, it could be more useful for 
researchers to observe citizens’ discussions and to write a report on the opinions of 
citizens. 
Technological development does not only affect a speciﬁc region or country, but 
also the entire world. However, there may be differences in the degree to which a 
speciﬁc society, community, or individual feels the impact of a technology. Therefore, 
it is meaningful to promote a global TA for the same technology. A more desirable 
direction for technological development can be found by comparing policy recom-
mendations among countries. In addition, the TA process of other countries will be 
a good reference when South Korea seeks a new TA process.

USA: Speciﬁc Context 
The United States has now been without a centralized technology assessment orga-
nization for longer than it had one. The 1972 creation of the congressional Ofﬁce 
of Technology Assessment (OTA) ushered in an era of legislative TA, during which 
it was sometimes said of the ill-deﬁned intellectual ﬁeld of technology assessment 
that TA was whatever OTA happened to be doing at the moment. While the memory 
of OTA’s 1995 closure recedes into a past that is increasingly hazy and—in many 
ways—irrelevant in both political and technological ways to our contemporary and 
near-future world, the current TA landscape in the US is comparable to its pre-TA 
landscape: As Vary Coates, the grand dame of TA, found in her pre-OTA doctoral 
research, just because there is no national ofﬁce for TA does not mean that TA does 
not exist (Sadowski & Guston, 2015). 
TA has persisted in numerous guises over the more than two dozen years since 
OTA’s closure. At the institutional level, a group of experts has maintained a TA 
capacity close to the centers of federal power in the Government Accountability 
Ofﬁce (GAO; formerly the General Accounting Ofﬁce). Less institutionalized has 
been an effort to reinvigorate a more participatory form of technology assessment, 
led by academics and others (and with which I have been closely associated) called 
ECAST—Expert and Citizen Assessment of Science and Technology. A third and 
still emerging effort, more akin to the social movement aspect of TA, is the effort by 
a group of philanthropists and universities in the US to create a new ﬁeld of ‘Public 
Interest Technology’—a ﬁeld that sees TA as an important element of its potential 
contribution, and OTA as an ancestral practitioner. 
USA: Highlights of TA Activities 
Like the former OTA, GAO is one of a small set of professionalized ofﬁces serving 
primarily the US Congress. Led by the Comptroller General of the US, GAO has 
been regarded as more deeply expert than the Congressional Research Service and 
more generalized than the Congressional Budget Ofﬁce, but nevertheless as expert 
in auditing and evaluation rather than scientiﬁc and technological issues (Bimber, 
1996). Since the defunding of OTA, however, a small, focused, and well-regarded 
TA capacity has emerged at GAO, issuing a small number of reports per year across

Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
267
technological ﬁelds (recently including 5G, CRISPR, climate tech, and health). 
GAO consolidated this effort in 2019 into its Science, Technology Assessment, and 
Analytics (STAA) team that, as of November 2019, had 59 staff members with grad-
uate degrees. GAO offers short and long formats for its studies and analysis, including 
its S&T outputs, which focus on more concise, more decision-focused information, 
and multi-media communication appropriate for the Web. Its S&T outputs repre-
sent perspectives of ‘foresight,’ ‘oversight,’ and ‘insight,’ with production times in 
each category ranging from days to two years (https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-
306t.pdf). In October 2020, the STAA team created the Polaris Council, a group of 
external expert advisors, and the Innovation Lab, to reﬂect the knowledge and skills 
of the fourth industrial revolution back onto GAO’s central mission. 
While GAO has maintained important connections to the broader S&T and TA 
communities in the US, it has remained mostly attached to the expert mode of 
practice that OTA also engaged in. Meanwhile, an informal group called ECAST 
(ecastnetwork.org) has taken up the mantle of participatory technology assessment 
(pTA). In 2008, the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at Arizona State University 
(CNS-ASU) conducted a multi-sited consensus conference after the Danish model on 
the topic of nanotechnology and human enhancement. Building on this experience, 
ECAST emerged as a partnership among ASU, the Boston Museum of Science, 
SciStarter (a citizen science group), the Loka Institute (a non-proﬁt dedicated to 
democratic S&T), and the Woodrow Wilson International Center. With the practical 
knowledge generated by the CNS-ASU experience, ECAST began to work on other 
pTA opportunities, including the three World Wide Views programs coordinated by 
the Danish Board of Technology (DBT) and projects for US S&T agencies like NASA 
and the Department of the Interior, as well as privately funded pTAs on smart cars, 
geoengineering, and other topics. In partnership with Baylor College of Medicine 
and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the ASU team and its Museum 
of Science colleagues are joining the anticipatory governance approach pioneered 
at CNS-ASU with the more reﬁned approaches to pTA developed by ECAST to 
examine public perspectives on human gene editing in the age of CRISPR. Espe-
cially with its global connections, this work has emerged as an important alternative 
to other public elicitation techniques such as deliberative polling. 
Among the intellectual movements—like the TA movement—that began in the 
late 1960s was that of public interest law. Supported by the Ford Foundation, public 
interest law provided opportunities for law students to train and lawyers to practice 
in the public and non-proﬁt sectors. Today, the Ford Foundation, New America, and 
others are attempting to create a new ﬁeld of public interest technology (PIT). The 
impetus for PIT derived from many sources, but people who were tech savvy and 
politically active were increasingly asking whether tech—and particularly digital 
tech—was delivering social progress as well cool gadgets. Huge potential invest-
ments in digital infrastructures, e.g., smart cities, coupled with conﬂicts over regu-
lation of digital platforms, e.g., the Facebook hearings, demonstrated a lack of tech 
expertise in government, while algorithmic bias and controversies over censorship 
and privacy punctuated the idea that private tech development was more about ‘how 
can we innovate?’ rather than ‘how should we innovate?’ Central to PIT is the

268
Appendix: Technology Assessment Activities in Australia, Brazil, Central Europe, …
Public Interest Technology-University Network (PIT-UN; https://www.newamerica. 
org/pit-un/), now including more than 40-member institutions, and a small grants 
program that supports some projects that are oriented in TA-like directions. PIT is 
dominated by contemporary digital issues, but it embraces the full spectrum tech-
nologies in their relationship to creating public value. The PIT movement is also 
associated with explicit efforts to add technical expertise to government through 
its TechCongress program, which, like the Science and Technology Policy Fellows 
program of the AAAS, places technical experts in staff positions in the US Congress. 
USA: Speciﬁc Challenges and Outlook 
Since OTA was defunded in 1995, there have been numerous efforts to reinstitute it 
(Morgan & Peha, 2003), including in recent years with some surprisingly bipartisan 
support. Recreating OTA would, however, seemingly require some unique partisan 
alignment that has not appeared, nor does it appear imminent. While it is part of 
the genius of American democratic culture, identiﬁed as far back as Tocqueville, 
that organizations based in civil society rather than government can generate real 
contributions—and ECAST and the PIT movement are real such examples—there 
are substantial challenges to a system that generates such multi-centered expertise. 
Speciﬁcally, expertise in the current environment is often deeply attached to political 
interests, and social media both easily ampliﬁes voices that purport to be expert while 
disguising their inexpertness or inauthenticity. This situation is not unique to the US, 
but it is perhaps accentuated there. 
There are clear traces of global interactions beneﬁting US-based TA, speciﬁcally in 
the participatory register, as the Danish consensus conference model inﬂuenced early 
pTA in the US (Guston, 1999), and then ECAST, at length derived from that early US 
experience, collaborated with DBT on World Wide Views. With the PIT movement, 
the US has an opportunity to return the favor. While PIT is in many ways cognate with 
Responsible (Research and) Innovation (RI or RRI; see Stilgoe & Guston, 2017), it 
offers additional opportunities to work toward justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion 
than at least the European level of articulation of RI values has offered. As I write, 
the PIT-UN is also afﬁrmatively deciding to expand associate membership to non-US 
institutions of higher education, potentially contributing to the further development 
of opportunities for global TA.
