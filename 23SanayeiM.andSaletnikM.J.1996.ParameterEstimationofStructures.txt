PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF STRUCTURES FROM STATIC STRAIN
MEASUREMENTS.
II: ERROR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
By Masoud Sanayei; Member, ASCE, and Michael J. Saletnik,z Associate Member, ASCE
ABSTRACT:
A method for the parameter estimation of structures was d~veloped in a companion pape~. It used
subsets of static applied forces and strain measurements and successfully Identified structural element stlffnesses.
In the presence of noisy measurements, the selection of these
s~b~ts drastically affect the
accu~acy of the
parameter estimates. In addition, there are a large number of combmatlons of ~pplied force and stram measure-
ments to be considered. Therefore, a heuristic method is presented for choosmg a small subset of forces and
strain measurements so as to have the least sensitivity to measurement noise. Once chosen, using a Monte Carlo
analysis the subset of measurements is analyzed to determine an input-out~ut
err~r relationship. This
h.euri~tic
method can be used to design near-optimal experiments for the nondestructIve testing and parameter estimatIOn
of structures. A truss and a frame example are presented and a small and noise-tolerant subset of forces and
strains is successfully selected for possible nondestructive testing.
INTRODUCTION
A companion paper by Sanayei and Saletnik (1996) pre-
sented a method for the parameter estimation of linear-elastic
structures using applied static forces and strain measurements.
Using a subset of applied forces and a subset of measured
strains, element stiffnesses of all or a portion of the structure
were identified. Simulated measurements were noise-free re-
sulting in "exact" identified stiffnesses. If actual nondestruc-
tive test (NDT) data is going to be used, the effect of mea-
surement noise on the parameter estimates must be studied.
As with all measurement devices, strain gauges are subject
to measurement noise. In the presence of noisy measurements
(known as input error) the parameter estimation algorithm will
give results different from those with noise-free simulated
data. The difference between the estimated parameters and the
true values (known as output error) is evaluated to determine
the impact of input errors for a specific subset of measure-
ments. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study and
compare the input-output error behavior of various subsets of
measurements. It is desirable, for labor and economic reasons,
to use as few inputs (applied forces and strain measurements)
as necessary. However, each set of input has its own input-
output error relationship; some sets of measurements are more
sensitive to errors than others. Based on the writers' experi-
ence, a random or judgmental selection is not typically suffi-
cient.
There are several theories on how to achieve the optimum
subset of measurements for parameter estimation; they are
mostly rooted in the active vibration control theories. Haftka
and Adelman (1985) proposed two integer programming meth-
ods for the selection of actuator locations to correct surface
distortions of an orbiting spacecraft. These methods are com-
pared with the heuristic method proposed by DeLorenzo, an
improved version of which was published in 1990. De-
Lorenzo's sensor and actuator configuration was used to con-
trol large space structures. Kammer (1991) developed the
method of "effective independence" for the selection of a set
of sensor locations for on-orbit modal identification. Modal

kinetic energy distribution was used to rank the contributions
of each candidate sensor location to each target mode shape.
Holnicki-Szulc et al. (1993) also developed a method called
the "progressive collapse analog" for optimal locations of ac-
tuators controlling the selected modes of vibration.
Lim (1991) determined that damage is easiest to detect for
those elements that are fully participating in load bearing and
contain the most energy. When such an element is damaged,
it is well-represented in the estimation results by a notable
difference between the expected and estimated parameters. El-
ements that are not participating in load bearing and thus do
not have large amounts of contained energy do not show this
variation. Rather, there is an overall change in the estimated
parameters of the system; individual element damage cannot
be picked out. Hajela and Soeiro (1990b) presented the idea
of "dominant displacements" for both static and vibrational
testing, whereby certain forces and measurements are more
representative of the structural system. They show also that
errors are more prevalent when loading does not result in an
equal stress distribution in each of the members. In a related
paper, Hajela and Soeiro (1990a) show through experimental
testing that uniform stress loading produces excellent results.
There is little research using static test data for parameter
estimation. Hjelmstad developed a method of parameter esti-
mation using static force and displacement measurements. He
expanded his research by studying the input-output error be-
havior of a linear-elastic static system in a paper by Banan et
a1. (1994). Noticing the large variation of the input-output er-
ror behavior based on the selection of the subset of measure-
ments, it is necessary to establish a method to select the most
promising subsets of measurements to ensure a successful pa-
rameter estimation. There are a large number of possible sub-
sets of measurements to be considered for NDT (Sanayei
1992). Sanayei et al. (1992) studied the impact of measure-
ment noise on parameter estimates and proposed a heuristic
method for the pretest selection of static forces and displace-
ment measurements.
The main goal of this paper is to study the input-output error
behavior of the parameter estimation method presented in San-
ayei and Saletnik (1996), and to design a successful NDT. It
is known that the effectiveness of a parameter estimation sys-
tem is strongly dependent on the measurement locations and
number of measurements. A heuristic method based on error
sensitivity analysis is proposed for reducing the number of
force and strain measurements, from a starting point of using
all forces and measurements to a final small subset that is
noise-tolerant. This heuristic procedure is called the best-in-
worst-out (BIWO) method and is used for the pretest design
of nondestructive experiments in the presence of measurement
noise, hereon referred to as experiment design. This method

selects a small subset of noise-tolerant measurements to ensure
a successful parameter estimation using actual NOT data. Al-
though the BIWO method used for the experiment design is
computation-intensive, it is straightforward and can be directly
programmed to require no human interaction. After the selec-
tion of the target measurements, only one NDT and one pa-
rameter estimation run is required. A truss and a frame ex-
ample are used to illustrate the preceding method. One of the
numerical examples shows a lower output error for a subset
compared to using the initial full set of forces and strains. This
shows that a well-designed nondestructive experiment can be
used effectively and reliably for parameter estimation; a pre-
requisite for the damage assessment and health monitoring of
structures. There is no guarantee that the result of the BIWO
method will be optimum; however, it leads to a near-optimal
and noise-tolerant system acceptable for all practical purposes.

behavior, connections, and support conditions). The modeling
error, as it is known, may also include other effects such as
manufacturing inconsistencies, residual or thermal stresses, or
material flaws. Modeling error is not the topic of this discus-
sion, and is not considered in this paper.
Modeling of Input Error
With all these possibilities for introducing noise into a sys-
tem, it is difficult, if not impossible, to mathematically model
measurement noise. However, for numerical experimentation,
it can be done by varying the force and strain measurement
values slightly with a known probability distribution. There
are a number of ways to model the input error, I.. The most
commonly used distributions are the uniform and normal dis-
tributions.
The uniform distribution can represent an equal probability
at anyone time ranging from -I. to +1.. The variance of
measurement noise is

The companion paper showed that the error function intro-
duced, shown here in the following, does not contaminate the
identified parameters if noise-free simulated measurements are
used:
[e(p)] = [e.(p)]· -
[e.r" =[B.HK(p)rl[F] -
[e.r"
(I)
The proposed strain output error function, [e(p)], is based on
minimizing the difference between a subset of analytical
strains, [E.(p)]., and the measured strains, [E.r to estimate
NUP unknown stiffness parameters. The analytical strains are
based on finite element analysis using the basic relation {F}
= [K(p)]{ U} relating static forces and displacements through
the stiffness matrix. To generate these measurements, NSF sets
of forces are applied at NDOF degrees of freedom and NMS
sets of measured strains are made for a subset of structural
elements. Also, [8.] is the strain-displacement mapping ma-
trix. For detailed description and derivation of this error func-
tion refer to Sanayei and Saletnik (1996).
The first test for a parameter identification algorithm is to
see how well it performs when given exact data. As was
shown in the companion paper, no measurement noise leads
to no identification error. In the real world, however, mea-
surements are never exact. The goal is to devise an approach
for the design of NDT, but once that is achieved, it will be
advantageous to know how identified parameters react to noise
in certain measurements. Thus, a method for modeling mea-
surement noise must first be developed.
Input Error
Any mechanical or electronic device has a range of mea-
surements beyond which measurements are uncertain. Even
within that range errors can occur for a variety of reasons,
including human error. Noise in the applied forces or the mea-
sured strains is known as input error. Strain gauges are delicate
devices; if not properly affixed they will give erroneous re-
sults. Additionally, misalignment with the local centroidal axis.
X, can lead to errors. The transverse distances to the centroidal
axis in the local coordinate system (i.e., y and i) are also
critical. Additionally, once the gauge is functional, there are
potential errors in reading it. Wire and solder resistance, the
accuracy of the strain measuring device, and proper balancing
and zeroing of the circuitry are all crucial to obtaining proper
readings. In addition to the possible errors in strain mea-
surement, there can be errors in the applied force measure-
ments.
There are other ways in which errors may propagate in the
parameter estimation algorithm. The finite element model may
not be accurate in describing the physical model (e.g., element

the distribution, it is convenient to use a 95% confidence in-
terval; in many instances, measuring devices have known er-
rors at a 95% confidence. Therefore, I. is set equal to 2<1 with
a 95% confidence. Therefore, the variance of measurement
noise is

To demonstrate the effect of input error on parameter esti-
mation, the 2D truss example from Sanayei and Saletnik
(1996) is again used and illustrated in Fig. 1. The modulus of
elasticity and cross-sectional areas are as follows:
The basis of the parameter estimation algorithm is the finite
element model {F} = [K(p)]{ U}. If measured {F} and {U}
differ at all from the exact values, then the identified para-
meters making up [K(p)l will be different from the exact ones.
This also holds true for strain measurements.
Next, in order to study the effect of the input error on the
parameter estimates, the two-dimensional (2D) truss and 2D
frame examples from the companion paper are used again.
These two parallel examples are summarized in the following
section, and used throughout this paper.

Eq. (3) is used to generate a set of normal random numbers
with a mean of zero and a variance of I~/4.
Having determined these distributions parameterized on I.,
it is possible to generate a set of random numbers based on
this input error value. For the case of forces, these random
errors are put into a matrix [Rfl of size NDOF X NSF. For
strains, a matrix [R,l is formed of size NMS X NSF. Once
[Rfl and [R,l are formed, they must be applied against either
the applied forces, [Fl, or the measured strains, [£l, respec-
tively. There are two ways of applying measurement errors:
proportional and absolute. In the case of proportional error,
the random numbers are used to represent error percentages,
and tend to have a magnitude of less than 1. In this form, the
actual errors e are calculated by
[e.l = [el 0 [R.l
[ef] =[F] 0 [Rf ]
The 0 = term-by-term (scalar) multiplication. The errors are
applied proportionally to simulate contaminated force and
strain measurements as
• Modulus of elasticity E for all elements = 30,000 ksi
(206.8 GPa)
• Initial iteration value of parameters Pi = 5.0 sq. in. (32.26
cm2)
• True value of parameters p, = 3.0 sq in. (19.35 cm2)
As an example, case 5 of Table 1 in the companion paper
is now solved with a 1.0% proportional uniform error applied
to both forces and strains and converged in six iterations. The
difference l00({p} -
{p,})/{p,} is known as the percentage
error in each parameter estimate and is reported in Table 1.
When noise-free simulated measurements were used in the
companion paper, the identified parameters were all 3.000;
however, when using noisy measurements one should expect
contaminated parameter estimates. The percentage error level
is highly variable in the estimated cross-sectional areas shown
in Table 1.

Absolute error can be used to shift the average error from
zero. The errors are applied absolutely to simulate contanti-
nated force and strain measurements as

[F] =[F] + [Rf ]
[t] = [e] + [R,]

The second example structure is the same 2D frame from
Sanayei and Saletnik (1996), as seen in Fig. 2. The modulus
of elasticity E is 30,000 ksi (206.8 GPa) for all elements, The
initial values, PI' and the true values, p" of the cross-sectional
properties (A = area and Iz = moment of inertia about the 't-
axis) are given in Table 2.
Case 2, as described in Table 3 of the companion paper, is
now solved with a 1.0% proportional uniform error applied to
forces and strains and converged in six iterations. The per-
centage error in each parameter estimate is reported in Table

The structural cross-sectional parameters such as area and mo-
ment of inertia may have large differences in magnitude. To
eliminate the possibility of one parameter overshadowing the
statistics of the others, percentage errors are used as in (7).
Then it is possible to summarize across all unknown para-
meters (NUP) and observations (NOBS) and formulate the
grand mean percentage error as

3. Clearly, there are significant differences between some of
the parameter estimates and associated true values in both ex-
amples. For this example, it seems that areas are estimated
more accurately than the moment of inertias. However, one
sample is not statistically sufficient. Therefore, Monte Carlo
analysis is used to study the impact of measurement noise level
on parameter estimates.
Monte Carlo Analysis
The Monte Carlo analysis is a powerful statistical tool used
to examine the complex relationships in a multivariate nonlin-
ear system of equations. A Monte Carlo analysis is essentially
a large number of observations (NOBS) of parameter estima-
tion in the presence of simulated noisy measurements as a
representation of actual experimental data. A similar Monte
Carlo analysis was performed by Sanayei et al. (1992) using
and displacement measurements. It is adopted in this paper for
force and strain measurements. In this case, there will be
NOBS X NDOF X NSF random numbers for forces and NOBS
X NMS X NSF random numbers for strains. These random
numbers are used to form input errors as described in (5).
Once the parameter estimates have been tabulated, a statistical
analysis reveals a relationship between the input error and the
output error.
Output Error
When the process is complete, for each unknown parameter
Pi there will be NOBS values producing NUP X NOBS esti-
mated parameters. It is desirable to reduce this large number
to a single grand mean percentage error (GM), and a single
grand standard deviation precentage error (GSD) for ease of
comparison. GM and GSD will be used to compare the input-
output error behavior of various sets of load application points
and strain measurement locations.
Taking Pj,J; to represent the kth observation of parameter j,
and Pi.t to be the true value of the parameter j, the percentage
error of the kth observation of the jth parameter is

where GM and GSD = system mean and standard deviation,
respectively. Any observations that do not converge are not
used in computing these statistics.
In the same sense that a sample size of 1 is not valid sta-
tistically, reducing all these experiments to just two scalar val-
ues is not an accurate representation; in particular, the GM
does not show maximums or minimums, but is merely a mean.
Monte Carlo simulations were initially performed with 100,
1,000, and 10,000 observations. The GM consistently reduced
when approaching zero. Therefore, it is assumed that the pro-
posed method is an unbiased estimator of the parameters with-
out any formal proof. Assuming an unbiased estimator, the
GM should be zero for a large NOBS; the expected values of
the identified parameters are the true parameters, with an error
of zero. Although it is possible to use different levels of mea-
surement error for each applied force and each strain mea-
surement, the input error is selected as a single percentage
value representing all possible sources of error. In this sense,
it is possible to establish an input-output error relationship
such that for a given I.. a single value is obtained for GM and
GSD.
Truss Example, Monte Carlo Analysis
All cases of Table 1 in Sanayei and Saletnik (1996) are
reexamined with a 1% random uniform proportional error
added to all force and strain measurements. Since Cases 2 and
7 were singular, they were excluded from this study. The num-
ber of converged cases in the 1,000 Monte Carlo observations
performed as well as the GM and GSD are reported and sum-
marized in Table 4.
For most cases all 1,000 observations converged and in
some runs a few of the observations failed due to ill-condi-
tioning of the sensitivity matrix. GM and GSD are smallest for
case 1 and a wide range of values are observed for other cases.
This shows that pretest selection of an error-tolerant subset of
forces and strains is paramount.
Frame Example, Monte Carlo Analysis
To demonstrate the input-output error behavior of various
subsets of measurements, Monte Carlo simulations were per-
formed for the 2D frame cases reported in Table 3 of the
companion paper. Case 6 was not possible to run due to sin-
gularity of the sensitivity matrix. In cases 4 and 9, a great
majority of the observations did not converge. These results
are reported in Table 5.
Except for case 1, none of the Monte Carlo experiments
were fully successful; thus, their statistics are not significant.
Cases 2-10 show a great variation in GM and GSD, indicating
that the 2D frame structure is not as noise-tolerant as the 2D
truss example. In addition, it can be seen that some cases are

so highly sensitive to input error that the algorithm cannot
converge. Therefore, a pretest study of various subsets of force
and strain measurements is required for the selection of a
noise-tolerant subset of measurements. Clearly, there is a large
variation in output error from case to case in both examples.
Next, a technique for the pretest selection of small and noise-
tolerant subsets of applied forces and measured strains will be
presented.
EXPERIMENT DESIGN FOR NONDESTRUCTIVE
TESTING AND PARAMETER ESTIMATION
There is clearly a need for an approach to determine an
optimal set of applied forces and measured strains. The num-
ber of possible subsets of applied forces and measured strains
is combinatorial and leads to an enormous number of per-
mutations. When using NOT data, it is beneficial both in terms
of labor and finance to do as little work as possible. However,
it is clear that by simply choosing a random subset of forces
and strains, errors and ill-conditioned systems can arise. To
this end, the algorithm's behavior in the presence of noisy
measurements must be examined. Error sensitivity analysis
will be utilized for the experiment design and is expected to
lead to a successful parameter estimation with small errors in
the parameter estimates.
Error Sensitivity Anaysis
The goal of error sensitivity analysis is to determine how a
given deterministic error in each particular force or strain
measurement affects the error in the parameter estimates. As
a technique, it differs greatly from the simulated random mea-
surement error used in Monte Carlo analysis. It also differs
from the sensitivity matrix [S] defined in the companion paper.
The error sensitivity matrix, [S.], represents the change in each
identified parameter, Pil i =1 to NUP, with respect to a small
change in each applied force, Ii, i = 1 to NSF, or each mea-
sured strain, £Il i = 1 to NMS. It is defined as

The error sensitivity matrix of (10), [S.], is numerically eval-
uated as follows:
1. Choose all the unknown parameters to be identified. The
rest are assumed known with a high level of confidence.
2. Select all the available force and strain measurements.
3. Specify a low percentage error (noise) to ensure a linear
input-output error relationship.
4. For a force or a strain, apply the predefined error. All
other forces and strains are left at their true values.
5. Proceed with an identification, and store the biases of the
identified parameters.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each force and strain, and form
[S.] as defined in (10).
The largest bias of each row is defined as the maximum
percentage error (ME) and the largest bias in [S.] is defined
as the maximum percentage error for all parameters (MPEA).
MPEA will be used for the selection of a small subset of noise-
tolerant measurements.

Truss Example Error Sensitivity Analysis
An example of an error sensitivity analysis is perfonned
using the same 2D truss model. Using case I of Table 1 of
the companion paper, all forces and strain measurements are
available. The identified parameters are cross-sectional areas
A, with a true value of 3.000 sq in. (19.35 cm2). A 1.0% pro-
portional unifonn error is specified to be applied to the meas-
urements one at a time. The percentage error sensitivities are
presented in Table 6. The maximum value per row is indicated
by bold number.
Given a 1.0% error added to any force or strain measure-
ment one at a time, these are the maximum output errors in
the respective identified parameters. These are not guaranteed
to be the maximums if errors are present simultaneously, how-
ever, they represent only the maximums given one error at a
time. They are useful as a representation of error propagation
in a multivariate nonlinear system of equations. The largest of
the MPE values is the maximum percentage error of all the
parameters, the MPEA. For Table 6, MPEA is -1.055.
Best-In-Worst-out Method
The data from the error sensitivity analysis is very useful.
It is apparent that a random selection or even a judgmental
selection of measurements is not adequate. However, using the
error sensitivities as a representation of the maximum output
error for a given single measurement error, a heuristic strategy
is proposed for the pretest selection of subsets of forces and
strains, which is called the best-in-worst-out (BIWO) method.
Consider the error sensitivity analysis of the 2D truss re-
ported in Table 6. Take the maximum percentage error for all
parameters, MPEA, which in this case is -1.055% for a 1%

This is an example of a situation where the last possible drop
run is not the one chosen for further use. Case I has the lowest
percentage error of all the runs, that is,-7.5%. Additionally,
it is much better-conditioned than case m, showing fewer sin-
gularities, not only in the drop analysis, but also when doing
identifications in the presence of input error. For these reasons,
case I is chosen over case m as the potential subset for NDT
and parameter estimation.
Overall, this is a very intriguing example. If all forces and
strains are measured, there is a 25.8% output error. After elim-
inating 10 forces and one strain, the maximum output error
drops to 7.5%. This is an interesting mathematical phenome-
non; it is counterintuitive that output errors would be higher
when all possible measurements are available. The BIWO
method has produced a set of only 24 measurements with a
maximum output error of only 7.5%, case 1. This is a signif-
icant reduction in the number of measurements from 98 to 24,
and a significant reduction in the error sensitivity from 25.8%
to 7.5%.
Frame Example, Best-In-Worst-out Method
The 2D frame also begins with all possible forces and all
possible strain measurements. No parameters are known; i.e.,
A and I, are both unknown. Using the same BIWO method as
was used for the 2D truss, the maximum percentage error sen-
sitivities are reported in Table 8. Based on the drop analysis,
the chosen subset of measurements for the 2D frame is case
I, as follows:
7. Perform an error sensitivity analysis using all available
measurements (force or strain). Calculate MPEA.
8. Temporarily drop one measurement, leaving all others
present. Perform error sensitivity analysis and calculate
MPEA.
9. Repeat step 8 until every force or strain has been
dropped once.
10. Determine which measurement has the smallest mag-
nitude MPEA in absolute value. Permanently remove
this measurement from testing.
11. Repeat the cycle of steps 7-10 until output error grows
unacceptably large, or NM :s NUP.
This heuristic technique is called the BIWO method. A sim-
ilar method was first presented by Haftka and Adelman (1985)
for the shape control of space structures. The best measure-
ments-those that have the highest sensitivity to changes in
the parameters and the lowest sensitivity to the errors in the
measurements-are retained. The worst measurements-those
that do not affect the results significantly-are removed. It is
desirable to select a noise-tolerant subset of measurements that
is sensitive to changes in the identified parameters. Using the
2D truss and frame, the BIWO method can be seen in use. For
each example, a small and noise-tolerant subset of measure-
ments was successfully located. This preselected set of mea-
surement locations can potentially be used for NDT and pa-
rameter estimation.
error added to £8' To determine whether a force or strain can
be safely eliminated, rerun the error sensitivity analysis with-
out that measurement and calculate MPEA. Continue elimi-
nating each available measurement one at a time, until a table
of MPEA values is constructed again. Locate the smallest ab-
solute value of MPEA; the system error is least sensitive to
eliminating this force or strain measurement. Therefore, it may
be eliminated permanently. Repeat this elimination until either
the number of measurements, NM =NMS X NSF, become less
than the number of unknown parameters, NUP, or the output
error becomes very large. This procedure is summarized as a
continuation of the error sensitivity analysis as follows:
Truss Example, Best-In-Worst-out Method
The maximum percentage error in all parameter estimates,
MPEA, for the 2D truss is summarized in Table 7. It begins
with all available forces and all available strain measurements.
Column I of Table 7 represents the force or strain that is
dropped for the BIWO method. "None" indicates that all
available measurements are present. Case a of Table 7 repre-
sents 19 error sensitivity analyses; the first row has 18 mea-
surements, the following rows have 17 (one measurement is
dropped at a time). The smallest MPEA value when all mea-
surements are present (row one) is -1.055%. The smallest
magnitude MPEA in absolute value for case a is -1.039%,
associated with eliminating either j; orh. Since the sensitivity
analysis is the result of dropping measurements one at a time,
only Is is permanently dropped and the procedure is repeated.
In this table, •'-" indicates a permanently dropped measured
force or strain. If the sensitivity matrix becomes singular due
to dropping of a particular measurement, that measurement is
readded permanently to the system. These are indicated in the
table with an "M". Superscript "a" is used to indicate per-
manently dropped measurements. The last row of Table 7 in-
dicates the number of measurements, NM. The results of 11
computer runs, cases a to k, are shown in Table 7.
Based on the first row of Table 7, errors slightly but not
drastically increased as further measurements were removed.
Case k, the smallest subset of measurements, is chosen for the
2D truss and is as follows:

Input-Output Error Relationships
At this point, Monte Carlo analysis is used to determine an
input-output error relationship (Ie -
Oe) for the final choices
of measurements at several levels of Ie. For each Ie, uniformly
distributed random errors are added proportionally to all mea-
surements. Monte Carlo analysis is performed using 100 ob-
servations and the parameters are identified for each obser-
vation. By performing a statistical analysis on the resulting
output error observations, the GM and GSD values are tabu-
lated against leo varying from zero to 50% for the truss ex-
ample and from zero to 10% for the frame example. The input-
output error relation for the truss and frame examples using
the selected cases from the BIWO method are reported in Ta-
bles 9 and 10, respectively.
To examine the input-output error relationships, it is desired
to form a family of line graphs based on several cases of the
BIWO method reported in Tables 7 and 8 by plotting the GSD
values against Ie values. A family of line graphs is shown in
Fig. 3 for the truss example, or in Fig. 4 for the frame example.
Figs. 3 and 4 are used to estimate the output error given an
input error. These graphs can be used to determine the allow-
able Ie by limiting output error in each example for the ex-
periment design. The measurement noise tolerance is expected
to vary from structure to structure based on the number of
measurements, location of measurements, and topology of the
structure. If the required input error cannot be achieved, then
another case with more measurements from the BIWO method
results can be used. It is clear that the frame example does not
tolerate measurement noise levels as high as those of the truss
example.
Comparison of Experiment Design with Other
Selections
The final measurement selection for the truss example using
the proposed BIWO method, case k, is compared with ran-
domly selected cases of Table 4 using a 1% uniform propor-
tional measurement error. For comparison, GSD of cases that
identified all 10 parameters in Table 4 and case k of Table 7
are plotted using a bar chart and are shown in Fig. 5. For cases
with a large number of measurements such as cases 1, 4, and
5, the GSD is fairly low. However, when more measurements
are eliminated such as cases 6, 9, and 10, the GSD increases
drastically. Using a small number of measurements, case k
generates a smaller output error of about 5% compared to
cases with a similar number of measurements, such as cases
6,9, and 10.
For the frame example, the selected cases I and m using the
BIWO method of Table 8 produced GSDs much smaller than
any combination of measurements in Table 5, identifying all
14 parameters. These GSDs are shown in Fig. 6. Selected case
I is performing even better than case 1 in which all possible
measurements are used. Although it is counterintuitive, more
measurements does not always lead to more accurate param-
eter estimates. This phenomenon is due to the fact that all
measurements include some degree of error, and for certain
types of structures they start to add up and cause high errors
in the parameter estimates.
Using the BIWO method, a small and noise-tolerant subset
of measurements is established for the truss example and for
the frame example. These designed experiments can poten-
tially be used for NDT and parameter estimation for damage
assessment. After the initial simulation for the experiment de-
sign, only one NDT and one parameter estimation computer
run is required for each structure.
In actual nondestructive testing there are always stations that
are impossible to apply forces to and stations that are difficult
or impossible to measure the responses for. In addition, for
frame structures it is difficult to apply a torque to any stations
and, in most cases, applied forces are gravity loads. Therefore,
the initial set of measurements is always reduced to a smaller
subset of possible measurements, allowing selection of the best
subset out of the remaining stations. These considerations will
reduce the size of the combinatorial problem to be solved by
the BIWO method.

CONCLUSIONS
To perfonn any parameter estimation, a nondestructive test
must first be designed. The purpose of the experiment design
is to determine a small and noise-tolerant subset of forces and
strains to be used for NDT. It must be decided how many
force and strain measurements are required and the most ap-
propriate locations for these measurements. In addition, the
acceptable precision of the sensors and transducers must be
detennined based on the acceptable error in the parameter es-
timates.
This study is based on the parameter estimation technique
fonnulated in a companion paper, using subsets of applied
static forces and subsets of strain measurements. Since the
measure of success for the experiment design using NDT data
is the level of error in the identified parameters, first an input-
output error analysis was successfully simulated for the pro-
posed method. This study showed that arbitrary or even judg-
mental selection of subsets of applied forces and subsets of
strain measurements can potentially lead to error-sensitive pa-
rameter estimation systems. This behavior results from differ-
ent topologies caused by the nonlinear behavior of the error
function that is minimized to estimate the parameters. There-
fore, an error sensitivity analysis was perfonned to study and
compare various subsets of measurements and their impact on
the parameter estimates.
To this end, a series of error sensitivity analyses were per-
fonned. By simulating measurements with a given applied er-
ror, the noncritical measurements are located and eliminated.
The repetition of this task continues until either the output
error becomes too great, or no more measurements can be
eliminated due to singularities in the sensitivity matrix. This
heuristic method is called the best-in-worst-out method and is
used for the selection of a subset of applied forces and a subset
of strain measurement locations, leading to a noise-tolerant
parameter estimation system. It is shown that it is possible for

output error levels to decrease as measurements are eliminated;
the use of all available measurements is not always the better
choice. However, certain measurements are critical to a suc-
cessful evaluation and should not be eliminated. There is no
proof that the selected subset of measurements will be optimal;
however, it is expected to be near-optimal, leading to a prom-
ising set of measurements for NOT and parameter estimation
for damage assessment.
Once an appropriate set of forces and strains was selected,
a Monte Carlo analysis was performed selecting a measure-
ment error with a 95% confidence interval (input error). By
performing a statistical analysis on the errors in the identified
parameters (output error), an estimate of the input-output error
behavior was established. This was followed by a series of
Monte Carlo analyses for several different input errors to de-
termine and plot the input-output error behavior of the selected
experiment. Using this plot, an interval of acceptable meas-
urement error leading to parameter estimates with errors within
the predefined acceptable range was found, and the experiment
design was successfully accomplished.
The experiment design is the pretest simulation process that
leads to the selection of a noise-tolerant subset of measured
forces and strains to be used for NOT. Then, it is possible to
perform only a single actual NOT of significantly fewer mea-
surements for data acquisition and parameter estimation. Using
this data, there is a high possibility of a successful parameter
estimation for the predesigned experiment. Future work in-
cludes large-scale testing of structures and development of
techniques to examine parameter estimates to detect any struc-
tural damage. Additionally, this work can potentially be used
for on-line health monitoring and damage assessment of struc-
tures.
