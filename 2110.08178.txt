Emergent algebras
Emergent algebras come from sub-riemannian geometry [8], [11], [12], where they have the
name ”dilation structure” or ”dilatation structure”, introduced in [10]. At the end of this
article there are references for emergent algebras and dilation structures. Mind that in all
references I used consistently wrong the right quasigroup name, it should be left quasigroup
everywhere. This will be ﬁxed in the present exposition of the subject.
Emergent algebras, ﬁrst time introduced in [9], are families of quasigroup operations
indexed by a commutative group, which satisfy some algebraic relations and also topological
(convergence and continuity) relations. Besides sub-riemannian geometry, they appear as
a semantics of a family of graph-rewrite systems related to interaction combinators [5], or
lambda calculus [7]. In [6] there is a lambda calculus version of emergent algebras.
Emergent algebras need three ingredients: a commutative group Γ with an invariant
topological ﬁlter, an uniform topological space X and a family of operations on X, indexed
with the elements of Γ. The operations satisfy algebraic axioms and also some continuity
and convergence axioms which are the reason behind the denomination of these algebras as
”emergent”.
Let’s take the ingredients one by one.
The group of scalars.
This is a commutative group Γ with an absolute, i.e. a topological
ﬁlter on Γ which is invariant with respect to the group multiplication.
The typical example is the group Γ = (0, +∞) with the multiplication operation, where
0, which is not an element of the group, but it is seen as the topological ﬁlter generated by
the intervals (0, a), with a > 0. For any x ∈Γ and any interval (0, a) the set of elemements
from that interval multiplicated by x (at left or at right, it does not matter because the
group is commutative) is the interval (0, ax), which implies that 0, as a topological ﬁlter, is
invariant with respect of the group operation. Such a topological ﬁlter is called an absolute.
We shall use 0 to write limits as a ∈Γ converges to 0.
Other examples of commutative groups with absolutes are (Z, +) with +∞as absolute,
or C∗with complex number multiplication and 0 as absolute.
The uniform space.
An uniform space X is a nonempty set endowed with an uniformity.
An uniformity is a topological ﬁlter U over X × X which satisﬁes the properties:
(a) the diagonal of X {(x, x) | x ∈X} is a subset of any A ∈U,
(b) for any A ∈U we have A−1 ∈U where
A−1 = {(y, x) | (x, y) ∈A}
(c) for any A, B ∈U we have AB ∈U, where
AB = {(x, w) | ∃y ∈X s.t. (x, y) ∈A and (y, w) ∈B}
1

The typical example of an uniform space is a metric space (X, d), where the uniformity
ﬁlter is generated by sets A ⊂X × X deﬁned for any a > 0 as
A = {(x, y) | d(x, y) < a}
Then (a) is implied by d(x, x) = 0 for any x ∈X, (b) is implied by d(x, y) = d(y, x) for any
x, y ∈X and (c) is implied by d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z) for any x, y, z ∈X.
We shall use the absolute 0 of the group of scalars Γ with the uniformity on X in
statements which contain ”lim a →0f(a, x) = g(x) uniformly with respect to x”, for some
functions f : Γ × X →X.
Deﬁnition 1.
An emergent algebra over a set X is a family of idempotent left quasigroup
operations over X, indexed by the group Γ, which satisfy the following algebraic and topo-
logical axioms (R1), (R2), (act) and (em).
For a ∈Γ let’s denote the left quasigroup operations indexed by a with ◦a and •a.
Therefore (X, ◦a, •a) is an idempotent left quasigroup:
(R1)
x ◦a x = x
(R2)
x ◦a (x •a y) = x •a (x ◦a y) = y
(act)
algebraic axioms which relate the operations:
x ◦a (x ◦b y) = x ◦ab y
x ◦1 y = y
x ◦1/a y = x •a y
On X we deﬁne the following operations which we will use later:
- the approximate diﬀerence
∆x
a(y, z) = (x ◦a y) •a (x ◦a z)
- the approximate sum
Σx
a(y, z) = x •a ((x ◦a y) ◦a z)
- the approximate inverse
invx
ay = (x ◦a y) •a x
Finally we have the topological axioms.
(em)
X is an uniform space; as a converges to 0
(x, y) 7→x ◦a y converges uniformly to (x, y) 7→x
(x, y, z) 7→∆x
a(y, z) converges uniformly to a function (x, y, z) 7→∆x(y, z)
(x, y, z) 7→Σx
a(y, z) converges uniformly to a function (x, y, z) 7→Σx(y, z)
2

Topological axioms, graph rewrites and ”emergence”.
The reason for topological
axioms is to allow passage to the limit in any order. The axioms (R1), (R2), (act) can
be reformulated into graph rewrites on trivalent graphs with typed nodes and numbered
ports, which is the start of the chemlambda project, as described in [5]. The axiom (em),
translated into graph rewrites, says that some patterns (corresponding to the graphs of the
approximate diﬀerence, sum and inverse) can be replaced with new nodes (for the limit op-
erations) in any order. From here ”emerge” new algebraic identities, or equivalently new
graph rewrites, involving the new operations. The same eﬀect can be obtained, but without
reference to uniform structures and limits, in the term rewriting formalism ”em” [6], which
is an enhancement of lambda calculus.

LIN, COLIN and SHUFFLE
Here are some other relevant notations, along with the more usual names from the ﬁeld of
quasigroups.
Deﬁnition 2.
An emergent algebra is linear if it is left distributive:
(R3) or (LIN)
x ◦a (y ◦b z) = (x ◦a y) ◦b (x ◦a z)
An emergent algebra is co-linear if it is right distributive:
(COLIN)
(x ◦a y) ◦b z = (x ◦b z) ◦a (y ◦b z)
An emergent algebra has the shuﬄe trick if it is medial:
(SHUFFLE)
(x ◦a y) ◦b (u ◦a v) = (x ◦b u) ◦a (y ◦b v)
An important example of a linear emergent algebra comes from conical groups. This
is an important class of topological groups which can be seen as a generalizaton of vector
spaces.
Deﬁnition 3.
A conical group (X, ·, e) is a topological group endowed with a multiplication
by scalars operation (a, x) ∈Γ × X 7→ax ∈X such that the following algebraic relations
are true:
a(bx) = (ab)x
a(x · y) = ax · ay
a(x−1) = (ax)−1
ae = e
and there is a neighbourhood U ⊂X of the neutral element e ∈X and a neighbourhood
V ⊂Γ of the ﬁlter 0 such that
(a, x) ∈V × U 7→ax ∈U
x ∈U 7→ax converges uniformly to x 7→e, as a converges to 0.
We have the following structure theorem, see theorem 10 [10] or theorem 6.2 [6].

Theorem 1.
For an emergent algebra X, ﬁx an element e ∈X and deﬁne the operations:
(addition) (x, y) 7→x · y = Σe(x, y)
(inverse) x 7→x−1 = invex = ∆e(x, e)
(scalar multiplication) (a, x) 7→ax = e ◦a x
Then (X, ·) is a conical group with neutral element e which is conical.
Conversely, for any conical group X and for any a ∈Γ deﬁne:
x ◦a y = x · a(x−1 · y)
With this operation X becomes a linear emergent algebra.
Curvature as deviation from linearity.
For an emergent algebra, the following term
represents the deviation from linearity:
LINa,b(x, y, z) = y •b (x •a ((x ◦a y) ◦b (x ◦a z)))
Indeed, (LIN) is equivalent with LINa,b(x, y, z) = z. But in the realm of sub-riemanian
geometry, more precisely for a dilation structure, this term is related to curvature, as ex-
plained in [8], section 2.5 ”Curvdimension and curvature”. For an arbitrary element x ∈X
and for c ∈Γ deﬁne
Ra
b,c(x, u, v, w) = x •a LINb,c((x ◦a u, x ◦a v, x ◦a w)
We know then, by Theorem 1, that Ra
b,c(x, u, v, w) converges to w, as a converges to 0.
In particular, for a riemannian manifold X, there is an associated emergent algebra given
by
x ◦a expx(y) = expx(ay)
where exp is the geodesic exponential. For this emergent algebra, we recognize the construc-
tion called Schild’s ladder in the term
ra
x(v, w) = logx

Ra
1
2 , 1
2 (x, x, expx(av), expx(aw))

The distance, measured in the tangent space at x, between w and ra
x(v, w) is controlled
by the absolute value of a2⟨Rx(v, w)v, w⟩, where Rx is the Riemann curvature tensor at x.
Commutator as deviation from co-linearity.
We can measure the deviation from co-
linearity with the term
COLINa,b(x, y, z) = (x ◦a y) •b ((x ◦b z) ◦a (y ◦b z))
For conical groups, the computation of this term shows that it is related with the com-
mutator. One can prove that for conical groups (COLIN) is equivalent with (SHUFFLE).
The following theorem is a sort of Bruck-Murdoch-Toyoda theorem [1], [2], [3].
Theorem 2.
Let X be a conical group. The following are equivalent:
- X is commutative
- The associated emergent algebra is medial, i.e. it satisﬁes (SHUFFLE)
4

- The associated emergent alegbra is right distributive, i.e. satisﬁes (COLIN).
Proof.
In a conical group with neutral element e we compute
COLINa,b−1(e, e •a y, z) = [y ◦b e, z ◦a e]z
where [x, y] = xyx−1y−1 is the commutator with respect to the group operation. But in
conical groups the function x 7→x ◦a e is surjective for any a ̸= 1. (COLIN) is therefore
equivalent with commutativity of the group operation. We already know that (SHUFFLE)
is equivalent with commutativity.
It is therefore natural to ask:
Question.
Are there emergent algebras which satisfy (COLIN) but not (LIN)?

An useful tool: geometric series
The geometric series is
∞
X
n=0
εn =
1
1 −ε
for any ε ∈(0, 1).
With the notation for dilations:
δx
ε y = x + ε(−x + y)
we can rephrase the geometric series as an existence result. Namely that the equation:
δS
ε 0 = x
has the solution
S =
∞
X
n=0
 δ0
ε
n x
for any ε ∈(0, 1).
The non-commutative version of this result is given in [11] proposition 8.4.
In that
article is proposed a non-commutative aﬃne geometry, where usual aﬃne spaces (over a
vector space) are replaced with their non-commutative versions over a conical group. The
work uses dilation structures, which are metrical versions of emergent algebras.
In the
mentioned article the proof uses the existence of a metric on the (non-commutative aﬃne)
space. We can do a simple proof without it.
Of course that the condition ε ∈(0, 1) will be reformulated as εn →0 as n →∞.
Pick a base point e , which will play the role of the 0. Then we want to solve the equation
in S
δS
ε e = x
for a given, arbitrary x and for an ε with the property that εn →0 as n →∞.
We want to prove that
(*)
S =
∞
X
n=0
(δe
ε)n x
where the sum is with respect to the non-commutative addition operation based at e.
More precisely this operation is ”emergent”:
5

Σe(v, w) = lim
ε→0 Σe
ε(v, w)
where the approximate sum is
Σe
ε(v, w) = δe
ε−1δδe
εv
ε
w
Recall that the dilations satisfy the (LIN) property:
(LIN)
δe
εδx
µy = δδe
εx
µ
δe
εy
The conclusion (*) can be reformulated as: deﬁne S0 = x and
Sn+1 = Σe(x, δe
εSn)
Then S = limn→∞Sn.
But this is simple, due to the following identities coming from (LIN).
The ﬁrst identity uses the fact that, once we deﬁned the addition from dilations and a
passage to the limit, then we can prove that dilations themselves express via addition. This
gives the ﬁrst identity:
Σe
ε(v, w) = Σe(δv
εe, w)
The second identity is easier, just use (LIN), there is no passage to the limit involved.
Σe
ε(v, δe
εw) = δv
εw
With these identities, the recurrence relation of the non-commutative geometric series
becomes:
Sn+1 = Σe(x, δe
εSn) = Σe
ε(S, δe
εSn) = δS
ε Sn
therefore
Sn =
 δS
ε
n S0
and the proof ends by recalling that εn →0 as n →∞, which implies
lim
n→∞Sn = lim
n→∞δS
εnS0 = lim
ε→0 δS
ε S0 = S
The proof is new even in the commutative case.
Here is a non-commutative example. We are in the group N of real n×n upper triangular
matrices, with 1’s on the diagonal. This is a subgroup of real linear group.
For any scalar e ∈(0, +∞) we deﬁne a diagonal matrix
eij = eiδij
(here δij = 1 if i = j, otherwise δij = 0; please don’t make a confusion with the dilation,
denoted also with the letter δ, which is introduced in the following).
Conjugation with diagonal matrices is an automorphism of N, in particular for any
e ∈(0, +∞) and any x ∈N we have
e−1xe ∈N
This allows us to deﬁne the dilation:
δx
e y = xe−1x−1ye
We leave to the reader to prove the following:
(a) this deﬁnes an emergent algebra over N
(b) that this is a linear emergent algebra.
6

We can deﬁne now the geometric series with respect to the ”addition” operation which is
simply the matrix multiplication in the group N: (here I is the identity matrix, the neutral
element of the group)
∞
X
k=0
δI
ekx
and by the previous post, it does converge if e ∈(0, 1).
Let’s compute the ﬁnite sums. First notice that
δx
e y = [x, e−1]e−1ye
where the square bracket denotes the commutator.
We then have:
m
X
k=0
δI
ekx = xe−1xee−2xe2...e−mxem
or equivalently:
m
X
k=0
δI
ekx = (xe−1)mxem
All in all, our convergence of the geometric series result says that:
if e ∈(0, 1) and
[y, e−1] = x
then
y = lim
m→∞(xe−1)mxem
Remark
that for n = 2, i.e. for the case of 2 × 2 upper triangular matrices with 1’s on
the diagonal, the convergence result is the classical geometric series convergence. Compute
by hand the partial sums in tis case to convince yourself that indeed the usual geometric
(partial) sum appears in the (1, 2) position in the matrices.

(COLIN) implies (LIN)
In this section we give a negative answer to the question formulated in the ﬁrst section. At
ﬁrst sight this is surprising, because (COLIN) and (LIN) are symmetric one to the other.
Therefore it would be expected that, as we have examples of emergent algebras which satisfy
(LIN) but not (COLIN), which are just the noncommutative conical groups, there should
be examples of emergent algebras which satisfy (COLIN) but not (LIN).
At closer examination we notice that the axiom (R2), satisﬁed in any emergent algebra,
breaks the symmetry between (LIN) and (COLIN). However, in itself this remark is not
suﬃcient to answer the question if there are emergent algebras which satisfy (COLIN) but
not (LIN).
Theorem 3.
For an emergent algebra with the group Γ = (0, ∞) the condition (COLIN)
implies the condition (LIN)
Proof.
7

Part 1.
Recall the (COLIN) condition: for any a, b ∈Γ and for any x, y, z ∈X we have
(x ◦a y) ◦b z = (x ◦b z) ◦a (y ◦b z)
Fix an element e ∈X, otherwise arbitrary. (COLIN) is then equivalent with
y ◦b z = (e ◦b z) •a ((e ◦b y) ◦a z)
If we replace z with e ◦a z and then we use (R2) and some groupings of terms then we
obtain the following relation equivalent with (COLIN):
y ◦b (e ◦a z) = ∆e
a(e ◦b z, E)
where E is a relative operation, namely
E = e •a ((e ◦a y) ◦b (e ◦a z))
We pass now with a to 0 by using the topological axiom (em) and we obtain in the limit
the following
y ◦b e = ∆e(e ◦b z, E0)
where E0 is the limit of E, therefore the inﬁnitesimal dilation of coeﬃcient b, based at
e. We write it like this
E0 = y ◦e
b z
Part 2.
The relation (COLIN) passes to the inﬁnitesimal level. Indeed, if we replace the
operations with the inﬁnitesimal operations (dilations) based at e then (COLIN) remains
true. This is true because for an arbitrary c ∈Γ we deduce from (COLIN) the relation
(x ◦e
a,c y) ◦e
b,c z = (x ◦e
b,c z) ◦e
a,c (y ◦e
b,c z)
where
x ◦e
a,c y = e •c ((e ◦c x) ◦a (e ◦c y))
We can then pass to the limit with c to 0 and we get the ”inﬁnitesimal” (COLIN) relation
(x ◦e
a y) ◦e
b z = (x ◦e
b z) ◦e
a (y ◦e
b z)
But the inﬁnitesimal emergent algebra based at e satisﬁes (LIN) [11] proposition 7.11.
Therefore now we know that it also satisfy (COLIN). As a consequence we get that it comes
from a commutative conical group. We denote with a dot this conical group operation.
Because the group is conical and commutative it follows that
(e ◦a y) · (e ◦b y) = e ◦a+b y
via techniques explained in [6]. Therefore the conical group is a vector space, with group
operation being vector addition and e ◦a x equal to the scalar a which multiplies x (up to
an arbitrary exponential).
Part 3.
The last two relations from Part 1 are then rewritten as
y ◦b e = (e ◦b z−1) · y · (e ◦b (y−1 · z))
Commutativity of the group operation · and (LIN) for the inﬁnitesimal level gives us the
equivalent
y ◦b e = y ◦e
b e = e ◦1−b y
8

(where in the last equality we used Part 2 and we make a slight abuse of notation for
the multiplication by the scalar 1 −b)
Now we come back to the initial (COLIN) and we remark that with the new knowledge
we can rewrite it as
e ◦1−a (x ◦b y) = (e ◦1−a x) ◦b (e ◦1−a y)
which is equivalent with
x ◦b y = e •1−a ((e ◦1−a x) ◦b (e ◦1−a y))
We pass to the limit with a to 1 this time and we obtain that
x ◦b y = x ◦e
b y
therefore the emergent algebra is identical with the inﬁnitesimal emergent algebra based
at e. Therefore it satisﬁes (LIN).
We know more, actually, namely that (COLIN) is equivalent with (SHUFFLE). Indeed,
we proved that (COLIN) implies that the emergent algebra is the one of a conical commu-
tative group, or we already know that (SHUFFLE) is true if and only if we are in a conical
commutative group.
