One- and Two-Photon Interference
Paul G. Kwiat
Taylor’s version of Young’s double-slit experiment with an attenuated light source is
often hailed as one of the key experiments demonstrating quantum mechanical inter-
ference [1]. Although it would be incorrect to say it is not quantum – all optical inter-
ference effects have their origin at the quantum level – it is now generally accepted
that such experiments are not non-classical. They usually allow a semi-classical
description in which the detector is treated quantum mechanically, but the ﬁeld is
treated classically. In fact, such descriptions can also account for a host of other
“quantum” phenomena, such as resonance ﬂuorescence and the photoelectric effect
[2,3]. For single-photon interference, one can readily convert from the classical ﬁeld
to the quantum mechanical description simply by relating the probability of a photon
being detected at a given location and time to the intensity of the classical ﬁeld.
The need for a quantum description of the light – the need for “photons” ( light
quantum) – arises when one considers higher-order photon statistics, e.g., involving
coincidences between 2 or more detectors. In fact, this is now the method of choice
for characterizing would-be single-photon sources [4]: send the light onto a beam-
splitter and measure the coincidence rate between the detectors in each output. For
a true single-photon input – formally described as an n = 1 Fock number state –
the coincidence rate will fall to zero (at equal detection times), a very non-classical
effect (a classical ﬁeld would necessarily cause detections in both output ports).1
1 More precisely, one measures g(2)(0), the second-order correlation function, equal to the number
of coincidence counts in a given time interval, divided by the product of the singles counts (at the
two detectors) in that interval. For an n-photon Fock state, g(2)(0) = 1–1/n.

Currently there is great interest in developing such single-photon sources, for
applications in metrology and quantum information processing ( quantum com-
munication). For example, the original quantum cryptography protocols assumed
the key material was transmitted using single-photon states [5], so as to deny any
potential eavesdropper the possibility of “tapping” the line. More recently, sources
of single photons “on-demand” are a critical resource for realizing scalable optical
quantum computing [6]. At present a number of physical systems are being explored
as single-photon sources. In the ﬁrst category, a single quantum emitter – e.g., an
atom, ion, or quantum dot – is excited, and consequently decays, either sponta-
neously or in a driven transition, emitting precisely one photon in the process. Much
effort is directed to using cavities to tailor the mode into which the photon is prefer-
entially emitted [7]. A second strategy is to employ systems that always emit pairs
of photons: using one photon as a “trigger” then heralds the presence of the other
photon. Examples include 2-photon transitions in atoms, or most prevalent, pair
sources from nonlinear optics, e.g., spontaneous parametric down-conversion [8,9].
In the down-conversion process, a high-energy pump photon splits – via the inter-
action in a non-linear crystal – into two daughter photons, traditionally called the
“signal” and “idler” (Fig. 1).
Following earlier experiments (by Clauser et al. [10]), Grangier et al., performed
the ﬁrst interference experiment using a light ﬁeld in a single-photon Fock state [11],
based on a two-photon atom cascade as mentioned above. One photon was used as
a trigger to condition the presence of the other photon, which was then directed
to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The resulting interference fringes, built up one
photon at a time, displayed a visibility >98%, verifying Dirac’s statement that a
single photon interferes with itself [12]. The same technique has been routinely
adopted to down-conversion sources, and used to demonstrate, e.g.,  Berry’s phase
at the single-photon level [13].
Once one has single photons, the concept of the trajectory of the photon inside
an interferometer becomes well deﬁned. One ﬁnds that the existence of any which
way information,2 labeling which path a photon took, will reduce the contrast of
s
Fig. 1 In a basic demonstration of single-photon interference [11], a two-photon cascade source
S is used to conditionally prepare a single photon, which is directed into a Mach-Zehnder in-
terferometer. Even though at most one of the two interferometer detectors ﬁres at a given time,
high-visibility interference fringes are observed, supporting Dirac’s dictum that in such experi-
ments “each photon then interferes only with itself” [12]. (Fig. based on [11])
2 This information may be due to entanglement to another photon or atom, or simply an entangle-
ment between the path and some other degree of freedom, e.g., polarization of the single photon.

interference fringes,3 quantitatively described by V2+D2 ⩽1, where V is the fringe
visibility, and D is the distinguishability of the paths [14]; the inequality holds if the
which-way quantum marker ( which-way experiment) is initially in a mixed (i.e.,
uncertain) state [15,16].
Curiously, the distinguishing information can sometimes be subsequently re-
moved, by making a suitable measurement on the which-path system. This phe-
nomenon, in which interference can be recovered, is known as a  “quantum
eraser” [17], and has now been demonstrated in many experiments (e.g., [16,18,19]).
Note that the interference is only revealed by correlating the detections of the photon
with particular measurement results on the which-way marker, thereby preventing
any superluminal signalling ( superluminal communication).
One recent experiment of this sort directed photons emitted from a single excited
nitrogen-vacancy color center (in a diamond nanocrystal) into a Mach–Zehnder in-
terferometer [20]. Waveplates were used to set the photon polarization in the two
paths to horizontal and vertical. The output of the interferometer was directed
through a rapidly switchable polarization analyzer, and then to a single-photon
detector. Results showed that the measurement could either reveal which-way in-
formation (by analyzing in the horizontal-vertical basis) or could recover fringes
or anti-fringes (by analyzing in the ± 45◦basis). Moreover, the experiment had a
 delayed-choice aspect [21] – the choice in which basis to measure the photon was
made after the photon  wave packet had already passed the initial beamsplitter of
the interferometer; however, this did not affect the results.
Another interesting series of experiments arises when the interfering photon can
originate in more than one source. In the ﬁrst of these experiments [22] light beams
from two independent single-mode lasers demonstrated interference fringes, even
when the intensities were so low that only a single photon was in the interferome-
ter at any given time. From a wave perspective this is hardly surprising – e.g., one
has no trouble accepting that signals from two radio towers can interfere. The under-
standing at the quantum level is that there is no way, even in principle, to distinguish
from which laser a given photon originated, due to the fact that the quantum state of
the laser itself is negligibly altered by emission of a photon.
However, a quite different result can be obtained for a more ‘quantum’ light
source. Consider, for example, trying to interfere the signal photons from two inde-
pendent down-conversion crystals, by superposing the photons’ spatial modes on a
beamsplitter (see Fig. 2a). In this case there is no interference, because the simulta-
neous emission of the twin idler photon from one of the crystals labels which source
a given signal photon came from; even if one does not measure the idler photon, the
mere possibility that one could in principle make such a measurement is enough to
prevent interference. However, it is possible to arrange the crystals in such a way
that this information is not available (Fig. 2b): by directing the idler mode of the
ﬁrst crystal to pass through the second crystal and completely overlap the second
3 Following Feynman, to calculate the probability of any outcome, we must add the probability am-
plitudes of indistinguishable processes that lead to this outcome, and then take the absolute square.
If the processes are in principle distinguishable, then we simply add the probabilities directly.

Fig. 2 (a) One does normally not observe single-photon interference when the signal modes from
two down-conversion crystals are combined, because the idler photons carry distinguishing infor-
mation about which crystal produced a given signal photon. (b). However, if the idler modes are
made to overlap, this information is in principle unobtainable. (c). Interference in the signal singles
rate is observable as any of the phases in the overall experiment are adjusted (A), unless the idler
mode between the crystals is blocked (B). Data reprinted with permission from Fig. 2 in Ref. [23]:

crystal’s idler mode, any process-labeling by these photons can be eliminated. The
consequence is that single-photon interference fringes are once again observable
in the output of the beamsplitter combining the two signal modes (Fig. 2c); this
interference occurs as any of the path lengths in the experiment are varied [23].
Experiments have also demonstrated that if a time-dependent gate is introduced in
the idler arm between the two crystals, the observation of interference of the signal
photons depends on the state of the gate at the time when the idler photon ampli-
tude was passing through it [24]: A closed gate – allowing which-path information
– destroys the interference.
Allowing for more than one photon opens the way for a multitude of purely quan-
tum multi-photon interference effects. Here we will only discuss two of the main
2-photon interference phenomena. The most well-known and arguably the most
important example is the Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometer [25]. Two identical
photons are directed to opposite sides of a 50–50 beamsplitter, so each individually
has a 50% likelihood to be transmitted or reﬂected4 (Fig. 3). If these were classical
light ﬁelds, then sometimes both of the detectors at the outputs would ﬁre simulta-
neously, corresponding to the possibility that both ﬁelds were transmitted or both
reﬂected. However, following Feynman, we must add the probability amplitudes
of indistinguishable processes. In the Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometer, the two
indistinguishable processes that could lead to a coincidence detection (both photons

Fig. 4 Schematic of a two-photon interference effect [29], in which each of the down-conversion
photons is directed into an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Although the path imbalance
precludes any single-photon interference, two-photon interference fringes (depending on the sum
of the relative phases in the interferometers) may be observed, due to the indistinguishability of the
processes in which both photons take the short paths and both take the long paths in their respective
interferometers
dip in the coincidence rate (Fig. 3c) as both photons then take the same output port.
The Hong–Ou–Mandel interference effect has now been used to enable precision
relative timing measurements [25, 26], and is the central technique to enable Bell-
state analysis for quantum teleportation [27, 28] ( quantum communication) and
various quantum logic gates [6].
As a ﬁnal example of 2-photon interference, each of the signal and idler pho-
tons can be directed into its own, quite imbalanced, Mach–Zehnder interferometer
(Fig. 4). In this case, no interference is observable in any of the singles rates be-
cause the interferometer imbalance is much larger than the coherence length of
the photons. However, if the two interferometers are matched to each other, in-
terference fringes can be observed in the coincidence rates between detectors at
the outputs of each interferometer: For continuous-wave pumping, processes in
which both photons take the short paths or both take the long paths in their respec-
tive interferometers – corresponding to two different emission times for the pair
– are in principle indistinguishable, and thus interfere. One observes coincidence

interference fringes which depend nonlocally on the sum of the phases in both inter-
ferometers [29]. This 2-photon interference effect has been used to demonstrate the
 nonlocality of quantum mechanics (i.e., producing violations of a suitable Bell’s
inequality;  Bell’s theorem) [30, 31], and forms the basis of some entanglement-
based on quantum cryptography implementations [32,33].
