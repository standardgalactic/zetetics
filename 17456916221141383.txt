The Bayesian interpretation of the human mind suggests 
that the brain does not perceive the world as it is, but 
as it is predicted to be (Friston, 2010). The brain uses 
probabilities, relying on previous expectations (i.e., “pri-
ors”), to infer the state of the world such that perception 
may be interpreted as a result of prediction rather than 
simply assimilating signals. These perceptions adjust 
following prediction and error processing, which is the 
brain’s ability to update models of the world and the 
body. Specifically, the encounter-confrontation of top-
down processes (i.e., mental representations reflecting 
the working hypothesis of the state of the world and 
the body) and the bottom-up stream of sensory inputs 
generate a mismatch between predictions and inputs 
(i.e., prediction errors), which lead to a revision of  
the prior representations. In other words, the pro-
cessed signals are essentially those that do not match 
prior expectations under this corrective-feedback pro-
cess (Ongaro & Kaptchuk, 2019). Therefore, mental

Abstract
The Bayesian-brain framework applied to placebo responses and other mind–body interactions suggests that the 
effects on the body result from the interaction between priors, such as expectations and learning, and likelihood, such 
as somatosensorial information. Significant research in this area focuses on the role of the priors, but the relevance of 
the likelihood has been surprisingly overlooked. One way of manipulating the relevance of the likelihood is by paying 
attention to sensorial information. We suggest that attention can influence both precision and position (i.e., the relative 
distance from the priors) of the likelihood by focusing on specific components of the somatosensorial information. Two 
forms of attention seem particularly relevant in this framework: mindful attention and selective attention. Attention has 
the potential to be considered a “major player” in placebo/nocebo research, together with expectations and learning. 
In terms of application, relying on attentional strategies as “amplifiers” or “silencers” of sensorial information could lead 
to an active involvement of individuals in shaping their care process and health. In this contribution, we discuss the 
theoretical implications of these intuitions with the aim to provide a comprehensive framework that includes Bayesian 
brain, placebo/nocebo effects, and the role of attention in mind–body interactions.

representations are updated when the brain receives 
new information that enables probabilistic representa-
tions (i.e., expectations) to be modified in a Bayes-opti-
mal fashion. According to this model, the brain follows 
the “Bayes rule,” which states that the prior (e.g., an 
expectation) is integrated or updated with new informa-
tion (i.e., the likelihood), resulting in an outcome (i.e., 
the posterior) that has a different distribution and loca-
tion (see Fig. 1; Hohwy, 2013). The distribution of a 
certain prior (e.g., an expectation) or of new information 
(e.g., an observation) may be more or less precise based 
on the variance of its distribution (lower variance cor-
responds to a greater precision). Precision can be thought 
of as the confidence one has in a prior or the relevance 
one ascribes to the sensorial information. Graphically, 
higher precision results in a narrower distribution (in 
Fig. 1, the likelihood is more precise than the priors).
With the perception, which is this process of belief 
updating, the brain tries to reduce the “surprise” (i.e., 
the prediction error). To minimize surprise and create 
a more stable and foreseeable representation of the 
world (Holmes & Nolte, 2019), the brain can leverage 
two different strategies, depending on the “direction” 
of the belief-updating process. The first, “perceptual 
inference,” is the process of constantly updating the 
prior following prediction errors. The second mecha-
nism is called “active inference,” which entails acting 
on the world (e.g., the body) to modify it so that sen-
sory inputs are consistent with prior beliefs (e.g., 
homeostatic regulation). Overall, the world is actively 
sampled or organized to ensure that predictions become 
self-fulfilling prophecies and surprises are avoided 
(Friston, 2009).
The Bayesian-brain model falls within the concept 
of predictive coding, which describes how belief updat-
ing rests on increasing prediction errors, which update 
prior expectations to form posterior beliefs. Crucially, 
this updating process depends on the precision afforded 
to prediction errors (Ainley et al., 2016; Brown et al., 
2013; Clark, 2013; Feldman & Friston, 2010; Kok et al., 
2012; Limanowski, 2017). In other words, if the preci-
sion is estimated to be high, sensory prediction errors 
have a greater influence on higher-level representations 
(i.e., prior expectations). Mathematically, this is related 
to the Kalman gain in Bayesian filtering (Kutschireiter 
et al., 2017); physiologically, this precision weighting 
is generally thought to reflect the excitability of neuro-
nal populations reporting prediction errors—which 
depends on various neuromodulatory mechanisms. 
Finally, from a psychological perspective, increasing 
sensory precision may correspond to attentional mecha-
nisms, that is, selecting those prediction errors that have 
privileged access to higher-level expectations (Feldman 
& Friston, 2010). Relatedly, in the context of active 
inference, attenuating sensory precision has been 
explored by several studies (Brown et al., 2013; Hohwy, 
2020; Limanowski, 2017, 2022; Palmer et al., 2015, 2017; 
Pareés et al., 2014). Psychologically, this is often read 
as sensory attenuation (i.e., ignoring the consequences 
of self-generated actions). Perhaps the best example of 
this mechanism is saccadic suppression, which is the 
attenuation of optic flow signals during fast eye move-
ments. It has been argued that failures of sensory atten-
uation and concomitant increase because sensory 
precision underlies many neuropsychiatric conditions, 
ranging from autism to nociception and functional 
medical symptoms (Ainley et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 
2012; Fotopoulou & Tsakiris, 2017; Jardri et al., 2016; 
Krahé et al., 2013; Sterzer et al., 2018). Another way of 
attenuating sensory precision is through distraction 
(Edwards et al., 2012), which happens when attention 
is diverted away from the stimulus. Different studies 
suggest that distraction affects the precision of sensory 
stimuli, including appetite (Brunstrom & Mitchell, 2006) 
and pain (Bascour-Sandoval et al., 2019; Buhle et al., 
2012).
In computational psychiatry, predictive coding has 
successfully provided models to explain phenomena, 
such as hallucinations, whose effect is mediated by 
strong prior beliefs, with a top-down effect that is par-
ticularly strong with voice hearers, and with an impaired 
belief-update process (bottom-up) in individuals with 
psychosis (Powers et al., 2017). However, the interac-
tion between priors and the information received seems 
to differ depending on the sensor modalities and their 
integration, suggesting a hierarchical organization that 
still has to be fully explored (Sterzer et al., 2018). The 
Bayesian-brain hypothesis also provides a neurobio-
logical account of functional-movement disorders 
(Edwards et al., 2012), once defined as “hysteria” or 
“conversion disorders.” Incorrect predictions about the 
consequences of one’s motor behavior might be the 
basis for the emergence of abnormal motor behaviors

(Silveri et al., 2022). For example, the altered prediction 
about the sensorial consequences of a specific move-
ment could result in a mismatch between the top-down 
expectation of the sensorial response and the actual 
response. In turn, this mismatch might be responsible 
for the altered motor programming; for example, the 
geste antagoniste in cervical dystonia might be seen as 
the movement that “works in anticipation of its sensory 
consequences” (Newby et al., 2016). Lack of a “sense 
of self-agency” during the movement is likely the most 
significant consequence of the mismatch between the 
expected and the actual sensory response (Maurer 
et al., 2016).
Placebo/Nocebo Responses  
as Active Inference Processes
The Bayesian-brain hypothesis is supported by growing 
evidence (Rohe et al., 2019) and has several potential 
implications for health and the relationship between 
mind and body. From a Bayesian perspective, for exam-
ple, there is a particular “healthy body condition” 
hypothesis (Ongaro & Kaptchuk, 2019) whereby if the 
variation of somatic sensations (e.g., heart rate vari-
ability) is within the bound of a certain distribution, 
there is no percept of somatic change. A “symptom” is 
perceived when an “abnormal” somatic event (exceed-
ing a subjective threshold of the healthy range of 
somatic-sensation variations) represents a prediction 
error. The Bayesian model offers a compelling explana-
tion for placebo effects and other mind–body interac-
tions (Kaptchuk, 2018). In this model, concepts such 
as expectation and learning, key components of the 
placebo effect (Barbiani & Benedetti, 2020), would rep-
resent the priors. When combined with sensory infor-
mation (i.e., likelihood), including proprioceptive 
signals, an active inference process can explain physi-
ological and functional changes. In other words, to 
reduce the prediction error, placebo responses would 
hijack perception not by revising the priors (which 
would be a perceptual inference) but by making sen-
sory stimuli consistent with them, promoting physio-
logical, functional, and biological changes (via active 
inference). The precision of priors and likelihood would 
eventually influence the physical outcome. For exam-
ple, a less precise likelihood, such as perceived fluctua-
tions of perceived pain, has been associated with 
increased placebo responses (Farrar et al., 2014).
The placebo effect can be defined as a psychobio-
logical phenomenon, which cannot be ascribed to the 
action of a pharmacological substance but rather to 
words, rituals, symbols, and meanings (Benedetti, 
2020). Clinical benefit following placebo administra-
tion is achieved with the administration of an inert 
substance or device along with verbal suggestions of 
improvement. Verbal suggestions are crucial for induc-
ing expectations, which are considered a key mecha-
nism in placebo responsiveness. Beyond expectations 
of benefit or improvement, learning mechanisms, 
including classical and operant conditioning, and obser-
vational learning are crucial mediators of the placebo 
response (Colloca & Miller, 2011). Whereas the “pla-
cebo effect” refers to the positive outcome following 
the administration of an inert treatment along with 
explicit or implicit information of improvement, its 
negative counterpart (i.e., the nocebo effect) refers to 
a negative outcome following information of worsen-
ing. In the clinical setting, the nocebo effect may 
emerge when patients are informed about the possible 
side effects of a treatment and/or when they hold nega-
tive expectations about the treatment itself (Benedetti, 
2020). Because the placebo effect is a psychosocial-
context effect, there is now compelling evidence that 
different social stimuli, such as verbal suggestions and 
therapeutic rituals, may change the patient’s brain. These 
effects are similar to those induced by drugs (Benedetti, 
2020). Ample evidence demonstrates there are many 
placebo effects, not one, with different mechanisms 
across different disorders and conditions (Benedetti, 
2020). Some of the most fruitful models to understand 
the psychobiology of the placebo effect dealt with pain 
(Colloca, 2019), fatigue and physical performance (Shaibani 
et al., 2017), the gastrointestinal system (Elsenbruch & 
Enck, 2015), and the immune system (Smits et al., 2018). 
Across these and other domains, placebo administration 
significantly affects outcomes with remarkable changes 
in biochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral 
parameters (Benedetti et al., 2016; Vits et al., 2011). 
Exposure to a negative psychosocial context (nocebo) 
may exacerbate symptoms and anxiety, eliciting symp-
toms or side effects that mirror the negative expecta-
tions about their onset (Colloca & Barsky, 2020; Pagnini 
et  al., 2020). For example, among participants who 
received a nocebo believing it to be experimental endo-
toxin, physical symptoms correlated with state anxiety 
(Benson & Elsenbruch, 2019). Whereas anxiety and 
stress are some of the moderating factors for the nocebo 
response (Roderigo et al., 2017), individual character-
istics such as optimism (Kern et al., 2020) and other 
personality traits (Frisaldi et al., 2018) are related to 
placebo effects (Frisaldi et al., 2018). However, further 
studies are required to define placebo responders  
and nonresponders. Placebo and nocebo effects  
may lend themselves to being considered through a 
Bayesian lens; the idea of applying a Bayesian explana-
tory framework for placebo mechanisms has been sug-
gested by prominent scholars in the field (Kaptchuk 
et al., 2020) and successfully used to explain placebo

hypoalgesia (Büchel et al., 2014). Complex psychologi-
cal factors such as expectations and conditioning are 
at the very heart of placebo and nocebo effects and 
may play the role of priors and shape the process of 
reducing predictive errors from perceptual stimuli. One 
example focuses on symptom relief following placebo 
administration; this results in a revision of a maladap-
tive hypothesis (e.g., a chronic illness that clashes with 
interoceptive cues indicating improvement). Crucially, 
the process of interpreting these cues as signs of ame-
lioration rather than “noise” can be activated by placebo 
usage that is nudging the brain to analyze small intero-
ceptive changes in the body as a hallmark of the heal-
ing process (Ongaro & Kaptchuk, 2019).
There are other types of mind–body interactions in 
addition to a “classic” placebo response. For example, 
a study with people with type two diabetes (Park et al., 
2016) manipulated participants’ perception of time, 
leading them to believe that more or less time had 
passed than the actual time. Remarkably, these patients’ 
blood-glucose levels followed perceived time rather 
than actual time. Although the chronological time was 
the same for everybody, participants who thought more 
time had passed had a significantly greater decrease in 
blood-glucose levels compared with participants who 
believed less time had passed. Another line of research 
found a strong association between the expectations of 
developing influenza-like symptoms and their actual 
development over the wintertime, even when account-
ing for previous influenzas or general health (Pagnini 
et al., 2020). These and other studies (e.g., Crum et al., 
2011; Rahman et al., 2020) describe how illness expec-
tations can become self-fulfilling prophecies (Crum & 
Phillips, 2015; Pagnini, 2019).
Neural Correlates of Placebo Effects  
in Bayesian Brain
The Bayesian-brain mechanism and placebo/nocebo 
responses also share some similarities in terms of neural 
correlates. A growing body of research has identified 
target areas in the brain that appear to be crucial for 
placebo responsiveness (Benedetti & Piedimonte, 2019; 
Carlino & Vase, 2018; Dodd et al., 2017). At the same 
time, a Bayesian-brain approach (Knill & Pouget, 2004) 
is rapidly taking hold in neuroscience and may help 
accommodate placebo phenomena. Recent models 
(Geuter et al., 2017; Lieberman et al., 2004) formulated 
to explain brain mechanisms underlying these effects 
identify the prefrontal cortex (PFC), insula, amygdala, 
hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray (PAG) as critical 
brain regions in which dynamical and temporal changes 
occur before and after placebo administration. In this 
distributed network, the PFC has been identified as a 
pivotal structure in a Bayesian-brain model that imple-
ments probabilistic inference involved in the com­
putation of predictions, the estimation of sensory 
discordance, and the continuous updating of priors to 
better predict the incoming sensory inputs and mini-
mize error (Cao et al., 2019). This hypothesis is sup-
ported by neuroanatomical evidence demonstrating that 
the PFC is a convergence zone for multisensory infor-
mation, receiving a widespread array of afferents from 
higher auditory and visual cortices and from association 
areas enabling a flexible strategy of sensory fusion 
(Romanski, 2012). In particular, the ventromedial pre-
frontal cortex (vmPFC) seems to play a key role in the 
generation of placebo responses. Research suggests that 
this brain area is involved in combining several streams 
of information (Roy et al., 2012), representing current 
states (Schuck et al., 2016) and structured relationships 
among notions, forming novel concepts (Barron et al., 
2013), and conceptualizing future states of the self 
(Schacter et al., 2007). Therefore, the vmPFC provides 
a neural substrate for the expectations. Moreover, it has 
been proposed (Geuter et al., 2017) that relational maps 
of representations are located in vmPFC and constitute 
multidimensional priors that encode both the magni-
tude of predictions (the quantitative intensity) and the 
qualitative experience of the situation, including vis-
ceral correlates. These rich situational representations 
are integrated with sensory information processed from 
posterior brain regions to build percepts and direct 
motivated behavior. The integration of information in 
which top-down and bottom-up processes interact also 
involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), lat-
eral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), precuneus, and tem-
poroparietal junction, regions associated with cognitive 
appraisals and attentional control (Ashar et al., 2017; 
Zunhammer et al., 2021). These dorsal frontoparietal 
and ventral attentional networks exert multiple effects 
on perception, emotion, and physiological responses 
via major descending projections to associative learning 
structures. Through these descending pathways, repre-
sentations that generate predictions are projected from 
prefrontal regions to limbic brain areas, including the 
hypothalamus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and PAG, 
and downstream to effectors in the lower brain stem 
and spinal cord involved in nociceptive, autonomic, 
and immune regulatory systems (Geuter et al., 2017). 
Via descending pathways, cortical regulation may finally 
reach peripheral organs and determine complex psy-
chobiological responses modulating hormone release 
and other transmitters into the blood. The engagement 
of a specific effector system depends on the nature of 
the placebo manipulation (Geuter et al., 2017). The 
involvement of these neural structures seems to further 
support the use of a Bayesian explanation for the

mind–body phenomena (Shams & Beierholm, 2022), 
but neural coding and computation need to be further 
explored and defined.
The Role of Attention in the 
Modification of the Likelihood
The scientific literature on the placebo effect points out 
the role of expectations (verbally induced) and learning 
(induced via repeated exposures to an active agent— 
i.e., conditioning paradigm; Colloca et al., 2010) as 
crucial priors (Barbiani & Benedetti, 2020; Benedetti, 
2020). The role of verbal instructions and conditioning 
is also widely explored (Wolters et al., 2019) and has 
clinical implications, including how physicians can 
facilitate a placebo response through the relationship 
with their patients (Evers et al., 2021). Although assum-
ing a mind–body Bayesian framework, researchers have 
given much less space to the likelihood and its manipu-
lation. In fact, the weight assigned to the different sen-
sorial information is not only determined by their 
intrinsic variability but may also be modified “top-
down,” through cognitive strategies that can alter their 
relative influence. One of the most prominent examples 
of top-down modulation of information processing is 
endogenous attention (referred to hereafter as “atten-
tion”), which can be used to bias perceptual inference 
(Limanowski, 2022). Only a few studies have explored 
the mediating role that attention and perception can 
exert on the placebo effect (Geers et al., 2006; Rossettini 
et al., 2018). Available data suggest that focusing atten-
tion on the expected somatic response leads to an 
increase in the effect when the expectations are highly 
precise but hinders it when the expectations are less 
precise (Geers et al., 2006). The complex interaction 
between priors and likelihood still needs to be under-
stood. Attention and perception are not independent of 
the priors; the Bayesian-brain model was initially devel-
oped to explain these two functions (Knill & Pouget, 
2004). Expectations and learning could shape the per-
ception of the somatic response, but that seems to 
depend on their precision levels. Understanding the 
role of attention and how it could be manipulated to 
promote desired clinical effect is a new frontier of 
mind–body research. We suggest that attention can lead 
to a shift in the position of the posterior distribution 
by acting on the precision of the somatosensorial infor-
mation, or on its components, modifying the likelihood 
distribution. We identify two “attentional axes” referred 
to a specific target: One (y) represents the precision of 
the considered stimulus, and the other one (x) describes 
how far the target of selective attention is from the 
priors by sampling these stimuli differently (Fig. 2). In 
visual terms, this model enables identifying the preci-
sion of the likelihood (the position on the y-axis) and 
its relative distance from the prior (the position on  
the x-axis). In other words, given the distribution of the 
prior, it enables computing the expected value (i.e., the 
distance from the prior) and the precision of the likeli-
hood distribution. Combined with the prior, this infor-
mation enables estimation of the posterior.
For example, if a person receives a decaffeinated 
coffee disguised as caffeinated, the activated priors will 
likely depict the psychophysiological effects of caffeine. 
Depending on their rigidity and combined with the 
somatosensorial information received, they will create 
a posterior, which will, in turn, influence the placebo 
response (e.g., being stimulated). This model suggests 
that if people focus on the somatosensorial information 
that confirms these priors (i.e., how energized they feel) 
or ones that would disconfirm them (i.e., how tired they 
feel), the position of the likelihood would also change 
accordingly. Furthermore, focusing attention on the 
information in an unbiased way or, on the opposite 
side of the precision spectrum, not being aware of these 
data at all would shape their precision level, again 
providing a different likelihood, to be combined with 
the priors.

Increasing somatosensorial precision: 
from mindful attention to distraction/
sensory attenuation
The precision of the somatosensorial data can be 
improved by pointing an unbiased (or, at least, less 
biased—i.e., with less rigid priors) attention toward the 
proprioceptive/interoceptive information that one is 
receiving, as it happens with mindful attention (Papies 
et al., 2015). Mindful attention is a specific form of 
attention in which a person is aware of thoughts and 
experiences and can observe them as transient mental 
events (Papies et al., 2015). It requires decentering or 
the insight that experiences are impermanent mental 
events rather than permanent states reflecting an objec-
tive reality (Keesman et al., 2020). Mindful attention is 
an essential component of mindfulness, which is 
defined here as the process of actively noticing new 
things as a way to be in the present (Pagnini & Philips, 
2015). Mindfulness also includes or incorporates the 
awareness of somatosensory attention (Khoury et al., 
2017). It has been suggested that mindfulness, as well 
as meta-awareness, facilitates an “opacification” of men-
tal states (Limanowski, 2017; Limanowski & Friston, 
2018; Lutz et al., 2019), promoting awareness of their 
processes and, eventually, fostering their de-reification 
(Lutz et al., 2015). Its opposite is defined as “mindless-
ness,” in which one’s perspectives and expectations rely 
on aprioristic knowledge and automatic thought pro-
cesses, judgments, and behavior (Langer, 1989). Priors 
are mindless insofar as they shape experience on the 
basis of previous schemas without regard to current 
contextual cues. In a mindful-attention state, the indi-
vidual focuses on the present moment, decentered from 
previous schemas. Thus, these schemas have a limited 
impact in predicting current experience. In Bayesian 
terms, the precision of the priors reduces while the 
salience of the likelihood increases. Simultaneously, 
unbiased (or less biased) attention toward the informa-
tion received increases the salience and the precision of 
the likelihood. As a result of these processes, the poste-
rior will be closer to the likelihood. Previous studies have 
suggested that mindful attention can reduce automatic 
reactions and behaviors (Papies et al., 2015), including 
salivation and automatic food biases (Baquedano et al., 
2017).
Mindfulness-based interventions and mindfulness 
disposition often resulted in association with somatic 
changes (Riva et al., 2021). For example, dispositional-
mindfulness levels predict different disease progres-
sions in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(Pagnini et al., 2015). They are also longitudinally asso-
ciated with lower levels of fatigue in people with mul-
tiple sclerosis (Pagnini et al., 2019). Mindfulness-based 
interventions seem to reduce physical symptoms in 
various chronic conditions, including multiple sclerosis 
(Carletto et al., 2020), cancer (Cillessen et al., 2019), 
and chronic pain (Hilton et al., 2017). These associa-
tions suggest a protective role of mindfulness against 
adverse physical outcomes. One possible explanation, 
which requires more specific investigation, is that mind-
ful attention can mitigate the effects of negative priors, 
resulting, compared with people with lower disposi-
tional mindfulness, in an improvement of physical

outcomes. By referring to the illness-expectations 
model (Pagnini, 2019), which aims to explore how 
expectations can influence the course of chronic ill-
nesses, we believe this would be conceptualized as a 
reduction of cognitive rigidity over one’s expectations. 
In this sense, the influence of negative expectations on 
the course of an illness can be reduced by mindfulness 
because it increases cognitive flexibility (Pagnini & 
Langer, 2015). The rigidity of a schema, in the Bayesian 
framework, corresponds to the precision of a prior. A 
rigid schema/precise prior requires more discordant 
observations to be modified than a flexible prior. 
Despite many desirable results associated with mindful-
ness and mindful attention, however, we note that a 
more precise likelihood is not intrinsically positive or 
negative because it depends on the context. In the case 
of a placebo induction, mindful attention is supposed 
to hinder the effect, because the likelihood increases 
its precision, while the priors (in this case, the placebo 
effect) become less precise. Moreover, as suggested by 
Stephan and colleagues (2016), for example, an exag-
gerated likelihood precision may lead to an overdrive 
of efforts to restore allostasis, possibly prompting 
fatigue and depression. However, an increase in likeli-
hood precision following mindful attention is also 
paired with a reduction of the priors, reducing the 
efforts required to reconcile them into a posterior.
On the other side of the precision spectrum, distrac-
tion and sensory attenuation are two examples of mech-
anisms that hinder attention on specific targets or tasks. 
When one is distracted, the precision of a stimulus is 
reduced, increasing its uncertainty. In fact, a lower level 
of precision corresponds to a broader distribution that 
encodes a particular degree of uncertainty about a par-
ticular cause (Feldman & Friston, 2010). Mathematically, 
this uncertainty is the average (expected) surprise over

Fig. 3.  Interactions between priors, attention, and the likelihood in mind–body effects. A placebo/nocebo 
induction shapes specific expectations (first-level priors) that combine with somatosensorial data (likelihood) 
and may be updated into a posterior. This posterior can be the source of the mind–body effect, through an 
active inference principle. As depicted in Figure 2, attention can be oriented toward an improved/worsening preci-
sion and toward specific characteristics of the data. These attentive processes can be manipulated (e.g., in an 
experimental context) and, in turn, influence the likelihood. However, attentive processes may be influenced 
by previous experiences, individual characteristics, and beliefs (higher-level priors) and from the placebo/
nocebo-generated priors. The process is characterized by a circularity because the posterior modifies the priors 
in a continuing updating procedure.

all possibilities and can be measured by the width of 
variance of the distribution (i.e., precision). From a 
Bayesian perspective, when the variance of the likeli-
hood distribution decreases (i.e., becomes more pre-
cise), the influence of the prior is reduced, making it 
less likely for priors to update, forming a different pos-
terior. Likewise, sensory attenuation allows to “switch 
off” sensory precision, abolishing belief updates during 
self-generated movements (Petzschner et al., 2017).
Getting closer or moving farther away 
from the priors: selective attention
Whereas mindful attention tries to “escape” from biases 
(i.e., higher- and lower-level priors), other forms of 
attention are, purposefully or not, biased. As men-
tioned, attention can bias perceptual inference by sam-
pling somatosensorial information differently, increasing 
the precision of specific characteristics. In hierarchical-
generative models, hierarchies of probabilistic repre-
sentations that predict somatosensorial information can 
be systematically altered by modifying the relative influ-
ence of sensorial cues (Limanowski, 2022). Thus, a 
direct focus on specific and selective components of 
the sensory information (likelihood) will emphasize 
their salience and shape the posterior in different ways. 
For example, when someone listens to a symphony, the 
sensorial information can be a compendium of auditory 
stimuli resulting from the orchestra playing. However, 
one can focus attention on a specific instrument (e.g., 
violins), changing the precision of the different com-
ponents of the information and, eventually, reshaping 
the sensorial experience. This selective attention 
emphasizes specific parts of the sensorial information 
in which perceptual systems must triangulate different 
sensory signals, assigning greater or lesser precision to 
specific prediction errors, resulting in a different experi-
ence. Paying selective attention to specific somatic per-
ceptions could result in an increased magnitude of 
these perceptions (Rossettini et al., 2018). The few stud-
ies that explored this modulating effect of selective 
attention did not manipulate its target. It is not yet 
known what will happen when attention is oriented 
(following placebo administration or some other mind–
body trigger) toward either the characteristics of the 
sensorial information that confirm the priors or the 
opposite direction. Furthermore, this effect may be par-
ticularly relevant when the priors are less precise 
because the likelihood would be less constrained by 
the priors’ influence and thus be more strongly modu-
lated by attention. This could result in an increased 
salience of the likelihood, which, in turn, will dominate 
the priors in determining the effects on the posterior. 
Because selective attention focuses on specific compo-
nents of the received sensorial information, it can be 
argued that the integration of multiple information 
channels, such as different senses, can further increase 
the overall precision of that specific part of the likeli-
hood. For example, hearing fire cracking, smelling 
smoke, and observing a flame is a more precise experi-
ence of fire than just one of these components (Riva 
et al., 2021).
In the context of this model, selective attention is 
particularly relevant when directed toward stimuli that 
are consistent or inconsistent with the priors. In the 
first case, selective attention is directed toward the con-
firmation of the anticipated mind–body effect. For 
example, after receiving a placebo for pain reduction, 
the focus will be on how much pain relief one is expe-
riencing. In the second case, selective attention deals 
with the opposite direction of the anticipated effect. In 
the analgesic-placebo example, the focus will be on 
the perceived pain. When directed toward prior- 
consistent stimuli, attention reduces prediction errors, 
and when directed in the opposite direction, it increases 
prediction errors.
Incorporating Attention and Sensorial 
Information in a Mind–Body Placebo 
Framework
Individual characteristics and previous experiences can 
spontaneously modify attention, for example, through 
premature cognitive commitments (Chanowitz & Langer, 
1981) or attention bias (Smith et al., 2006). In the mind–
body framework, for example, previous painful experi-
ences may hijack attention toward pain-relevant cues, 
increasing the salience of sensory information confirm-
ing pain (Villemure & Bushnell, 2002). In turn, this 
spontaneously shifted attention may affect how one 
approaches incoming sensory stimuli (i.e., the likeli-
hood), influencing their levels of precision and, in turn, 
changing the posterior. Introducing a complex role of 
attention, influenced by past experiences, individual 
characteristics, and current priors, may help explain  
a controverted phenomenon (reported in one study 
involving patients with Parkinson’s disease [PD];  
Lidstone et al., 2010). In this study, PD patients were 
told different probabilities (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) 
of receiving an active medication versus placebo, but 
in fact, they all received a fake treatment. Remarkably, 
only those patients who were informed of a 75% prob-
ability of receiving the drug showed a significant 
increase in dopamine release in the striatum, whereas 
no improvements were observed in patients who were 
given a 100% probability. In other words, the placebo

response manifested only under a condition of mild 
(75% probability) and not complete (100% probability) 
certainty of receiving the drug. Although this may 
sound counterintuitive, because it challenges the notion 
that placebo effects are more likely to occur when 
priors have a higher degree of certainty or precision, 
this conundrum may be solved by introducing the role 
of attention: The lesser degree of certainty (i.e., lower 
precision) of the placebo-induced expectations could 
have heightened patients’ attention toward bodily sen-
sations that were consistent with the anticipated effects 
of the drug, thus making it more likely for these same 
effects to occur, including those at a neurobiological 
level (i.e., dopamine release). This is consistent with 
evidence that placebo effects are stronger when one 
closely attends to expectation-relevant somatic sensa-
tions (Geers et al., 2006; Rossettini et al., 2018). Con-
trarily, complete confidence (100% probability) of 
receiving the drug could have made patients less 
actively engaged in the detection of its anticipated 
effects, decreasing their level of somatic focus (i.e., 
attention toward the body) and, in turn, the magnitude 
of the placebo effect.
Any placebo/nocebo procedure engenders expecta-
tions, which may be influenced by higher-level priors 
(e.g., trust in medicine, previous experience with this 
treatment). These higher-level priors may themselves 
affect the likelihood (or its specific sensorial compo-
nents), through attentional mechanisms, beyond any 
“active” placebo or attention manipulation. The effects 
of a placebo procedure are therefore somewhat “con-
taminated” by and built on top of this substrate of 
higher-level priors. The combination of these effects 
would inevitably lead to a more “hybrid” form of atten-
tion (i.e., not only the one activated by the ongoing 
placebo/nocebo procedure). This hybrid attention then 
may affect the way information is captured and pro-
cessed (i.e., the likelihood) and, in turn, the effect that 
is experienced (i.e., the posterior, Figure 3). In the afore-
mentioned coffee example, one’s previous experiences 
with coffee, suggestibility, and energy levels will con-
tribute to shaping the placebo-related priors (e.g., 
increase in stimulation) but may also influence the way 
one pays attention to the somatosensorial information.
The role of the higher-order priors can be substantial 
for the promotion of placebo–nocebo effects, but a 
detailed review of their characteristics goes beyond the 
scope of this article. Previous studies have largely 
explored the role of expectations and described differ-
ent individual characteristics and previous learning 
experiences related to these higher-level priors; how-
ever, limited information is available regarding the 
potential of attention manipulations in promoting dif-
ferent mind–body effects.
Conclusions
Over the past several decades, the scientific community 
investigating placebo/nocebo responses and other 
mind–body effects has contributed to outlining the 
impact of the priors (e.g., expectations and learning) on 
these phenomena. However, evidence focusing on the 
likelihood (i.e., sensory information) and the role of 
attention as a potential mediator of these effects remains 
largely unexplored. The hypothesis defined in this arti-
cle suggests that particular ways of directing attention 
may shape these effects by either strengthening or 
downplaying them. Similar to exploring the role of pre-
dictive coding in the explanation of psychotic symptoms 
(e.g., Powers et al., 2017), empirical data to test the 
validity of this model are required. An empirical confir-
mation of the model, or potentially just the main hypoth-
esis, entails that attention earn a spot among the main 
mechanisms (mostly referred to as the priors modifica-
tion) that have already demonstrated effectiveness in 
shaping placebo/nocebo effects and other mind–body 
phenomena. Improved knowledge of the role of likeli-
hood and attention will allow for better management 
and “control” of placebo/nocebo effects and mind–body 
phenomena, enhancing or minimizing them depending 
on the circumstances (e.g., reducing the impact of nega-
tive expectations about side effects or negative diagno-
sis). Furthermore, the focus on attention emphasizes the 
role of the individuals, who become actively engaged 
in the process of shaping their health and is no longer 
purely at the mercy of external circumstances.
