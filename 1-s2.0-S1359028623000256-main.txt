Swarming is a collective bacterial behavior in which a dense population of bacterial cells moves over a porous 
surface, resulting in the expansion of the population. This collective behavior can guide bacteria away from 
potential stressors such as antibiotics and bacterial viruses. However, the mechanisms responsible for the or­
ganization of swarms are not understood. Here, we briefly review models that are based on bacterial sensing and 
fluid mechanics that are proposed to guide swarming in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To 
provide further insight into the role of fluid mechanics in P. aeruginosa swarms, we track the movement of 
tendrils and the flow of surfactant using a novel technique that we have developed, Imaging of Reflected Illu­
minated Structures (IRIS). Our measurements show that tendrils and surfactants form distinct layers that grow in 
lockstep with each other. The results raise new questions about existing swarming models and the possibility that 
the flow of surfactants impacts tendril development. These findings emphasize that swarm organization involves 
an interplay between biological processes and fluid mechanics.   
At the single-cell level, bacteria function as individual organisms, 
lacking any apparent coordination mechanism. However, when their 
cell density surpasses a critical threshold, bacteria exhibit coordinated 
behaviors that are reminiscent of processes in multicellular organisms. 
The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has two notable collec­
tive behaviors when cells reach high density: biofilm formation and 
swarming motility. These behaviors produce bacterial populations that 
are profoundly important in natural environments and in the healthcare 
setting [1–3]. While biofilms and swarms are both dense populations, 
their cellular states are distinct [3–5]. Individual cells within swarms are 
highly motile, active, and are associated with low levels of the intra­
cellular nucleotide cyclic di-GMP. In contrast, individual cells in bio­
films are less motile, have higher levels of cyclic di-GMP, and adhere to 
surfaces, to other cells, and to the extracellular matrix. The mechanisms 
responsible for the structural organization and development of biofilms 
have been characterized in detail in recent studies [6–9]. However, far 
less is known about the mechanisms responsible for these aspects of 
bacterial swarms. Given that swarming is a major bacterial lifestyle, it is 
important to address the knowledge gap on the mechanisms responsible 
for this behavior. 
Swarming is a form of collective behavior observed in diverse 
bacteria that grow on porous surfaces such as agar [1]. At the most 
fundamental level, swarming results in the spatial expansion of a bac­
terial population. A striking feature of swarms is the diverse patterns 
that are observed among different species, with some producing den­
dritic and fractal-like patterns. Significant effort has been devoted to 
establishing a unified understanding of swarming by collating data and 
models from multiple organisms. One limitation of this approach is that 
it potentially convolves the effects of multiple unrelated motility 
mechanisms. Nuances in motility modalities such as sliding and swim­
ming may be at work in different bacterial organisms and could 
contribute to the swarming patterns that emerge. For example, the for­
mation of side-by-side cell groups known as rafts are required for 
swarming in Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis [10,11]. These rafts are 
thought to arise through bundling of multiple flagella with neighboring 
cells. In contrast, most P. aeruginosa strains produce only a single fla­
gellum and are not known to form rafts. Despite the absence of raft 
formation, swarming is observed in P. aeruginosa. To disentangle the 
effects of rafting and other mechanisms from different species that 
contribute to swarming, we have focused our discussion on only a single 
species, P. aeruginosa. A significant number of empirical and modeling 
studies on swarming have been performed on this organism. One of the

hallmark features of a P. aeruginosa swarm is the appearance of dendritic 
patterns, also referred to as tendrils, which are dense bacterial growths 
that extend radially from the center of the population (Fig. 1A). The 
production of surfactants in the form of rhamnolipids and 3-(3- 
hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs), and flagellar activity are 
both required for tendril formation [12,13]. Surfactants decrease fric­
tion with the surface and flagella propel cells within the swarm. It is 
unclear how the combination of these mechanisms give rise to tendril 
formation and swarm expansion. A central question that remains 
outstanding is what mechanisms are responsible for the tendril patterns 
that emerge in P. aeruginosa swarms? 
1. Models of tendril development 
Multiple models based on bacterial signaling and fluid mechanics 
propose distinct tendril formation mechanisms (summarized in Fig. 1B). 
However, the extent to which the models are complementary to or 
exclusive of one another is unclear. A signaling model proposes that 
P. aeruginosa senses rhamnolipids and HAAs that are secreted by other 
portions of the swarm [14]. Di-rhamnolipids and HAAs have opposing 
roles: di-rhamnolipids attract swarming cells and promote tendril for­
mation whereas HAAs are strong repellants and inhibit tendril formation 
[15,16]. SadB, a signal transduction protein that regulates flagella 
production, has been proposed to sense rhamnolipids, whether directly 
or indirectly [14]. In this model, tendril movement is altered through 
coordination between surfactant production and surfactant sensing. In 
addition, tendrils are repelled by the quorum sensing molecule 2-heptyl- 
3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS) [17]. It is possible that PQS is sensed 
through the PQS-binding quorum sensing regulator PqsR [18] and alters 
tendril direction in response. While the detection of surfactants and PQS 
offers a plausible sensing mechanism, this model does not address how 
tendril direction can be altered in response. The requirement of flagella 
for tendril formation suggests that swimming is an important process. It 
is commonly assumed that swimming motility can alter tendril direc­
tion, however bacteria cannot swim beyond the edge of tendrils because 
they are confined by surface tension. It is thus unclear how the action of 
flagella and swimming motility could alter tendril direction. 
Additional insight into tendril formation has come from studies that 
consider the role of fluid mechanics, in which a swarm is considered to 
be a thin film of liquid. Their findings suggest that biophysical mecha­
nisms could have a significant role in tendril formation. Two major 
mechanisms have been proposed to explain how tendrils develop: 
Marangoni flow and pressure-driven flow [19,20]. Marangoni flow 
arises from a surface tension gradient that is created by a decrease in 
rhamnolipid production from the center of the swarm towards the 
leading edge of tendril tips [19]. This creates a flow of liquid within the 
tendril that drives the tendril towards increasing surface tension. In the 
pressure-driven flow model, an influx of water from the agar layer into 
the swarm layer creates a pressure that drives the outward expansion of 
the tendril [20]. Several models based on swarming in Escherichia coli 
suggest that osmolytes produced by bacteria are responsible for driving 
the influx of water into the swarm layer [21–23]. A notable feature of 
both these fluid mechanics-based models is that tendril formation does 
not require the bacterial detection of rhamnolipids or other molecules, 
in contrast to the sensing models discussed above. Bacterial sensing, 
Marangoni flow, and pressure-driven flow may all work in parallel to 
form tendrils (Fig. 1B), though the relative contribution of each mech­
anism is unknown. Thus, there is a need for further evaluation of these 
models using experimental methods. 
A significant challenge in validating the thin liquid film interpreta­
tion of swarming is tracking the surfactant component of a swarm, given 
that surfactants produced by P. aeruginosa are optically transparent. A 
number of techniques can capture distinct aspects of swarms. For 
example, the bulk of swarms can be imaged at the cm-scale using widely- 
available consumer cameras or scanners, though these methods do not 
capture the surfactant [24,25]. Individual cell trajectories within 
swarms can be captured using brightfield and fluorescence microscopy 
combined with the use of time-lapse imaging and computational anal­
ysis [26]. Movements within the swarm can also be tracked using 
microbubbles of a water-insoluble surfactant, MgO particles, and gold 
nanorods [27–29]. Characterization of surfactants has been performed 
using methylene blue and Nile red dyes [30,31] as well as drop collapse 
assays [32]. However, these approaches can perturb swarms. Dyes can 
alter surfactant and swarm dynamics while drop collapse assays require 
removal of surfactant from the swarm. 
2. Visualizing the dynamics of the surfactant layer through IRIS 
To better measure the dynamics of surfactants and swarms without 
perturbing them, our lab developed an imaging method that relies on 
surface reflection. Here, the swarm surface is illuminated by a structured 
image and the reflection off the surface is captured by a camera. The 
structured image consists of alternating black and white squares which 
increase the contrast of surface features, including the liquid–air inter­
face at the edge of the swarm. This technique, which we refer to as 
Imaging of Reflected Illuminated Structures (IRIS), provides high reso­
lution images of an optically transparent liquid. The technique is non- 
invasive, requires no modification of the swarm or growth conditions,

and fluid mechanics-based processes that contribute to the development and organization of P. aeruginosa swarms on agar surfaces. Surfactant produced by the swarm 
reduces friction between tendrils and the surface. Tendrils avoid other tendrils through surfactant sensing. Tendrils are also repelled by the quorum sensing molecule 
PQS, which is over-produced by P. aeruginosa that are stressed by antibiotics or infected with phage. The expansion of tendrils is facilitated by Marangoni flow and 
driven by pressure that develops from the influx of fluid from the surface into the tendril.

and is simple and cost-effective. 
We imaged a P. aeruginosa swarm using multiple methods of illu­
mination. Under ambient lighting, in which illumination was provided 
by ceiling lights of the lab, tendrils were observed but surfactant was not 
visible (Fig. 2 i). A similar result was observed using an illumination 
setup in which a single uniform white image was reflected off of the 
swarm surface (Fig. 2 ii). When the illumination was changed from a 
uniform image to one that was structured in the form of repeating black 
and white squares, additional surface details were observed. In partic­
ular, tendril topography and a layer of surfactant that surrounded the 
swarm tendrils were visible (Fig. 2 iii, iv). This method relies on the 
effect of the contrast created by the structured image. For example, a 
perfectly flat surface produces an undistorted reflection of the structured 
image. On the other hand, changes in curvature that are present on a 
non-flat surface produce distortions in the reflected structured image. 
These distortions bring non-flat surface features into the foreground of 
the image. Liquid boundaries and swarming tendrils, which have large 
changes in surface curvature, appear as distortions of the structured 
image. 
Imaging of P. aeruginosa swarms using IRIS revealed new details that 
can better address a fluid mechanics-based interpretation of swarming. 
Two well-defined boundaries were observed: a boundary around the 
outer edge of the tendrils that encompassed the bacterial growth, and a 
larger circular boundary that encompassed all the tendrils (Fig. 2 iii, iv). 
The larger boundary is consistent with previous observations of sur­
factants that are produced by cells in the tendrils [31,33]. In the IRIS 
image, surfactants appeared to form a layer on which the tendrils formed 
an additional layer (Fig. 2 iv). Using edge detection software, masks 
were overlaid on the image to demarcate the tendrils and surfactant 
(Fig. 2 v). 
To investigate the dynamics of the tendril and surfactant layers, we 
performed time-lapse imaging of the swarm using IRIS. By performing 
an image subtraction between successive images, we identified portions 
of the swarm that have non-zero instantaneous speeds (Fig. 3A). This 
differential IRIS approach identifies parts of the swarm that are actively 
expanding or moving. The greatest movements within the swarm were 
observed at the tendril tips where the tendrils meet the surfactant layer, 
and at the outermost boundary of the surfactant layer (Fig. 3A). To our 
surprise, the tendril tips and the surfactant boundary expanded simul­
taneously, with a strong correlation (r = 0.99) between their rates of 
expansion (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that the tendril and surfactant 
layers are coupled during swarm expansion. 
These observations provide new insight into the structure of the 
swarm and suggest that swarms consist of multiple distinct layers rather 
than a single thin film of liquid. Additionally, the coupling observed 
between the tendril and surfactant layers raises the possibility that al­
terations in one layer could impact the movement of the other. For 
example, changes in the flow of the surfactant layer could alter the 
movement of tendrils. Such a mechanism would have significant im­
plications on how tendrils develop. In upcoming work from our lab, it is 
reported that P. aeruginosa tendrils are deflected by molecules that alter 
the flow of the surfactant layer [34]. Using IRIS, it is found that a range 
of molecules including PQS and those produced by the bacterium 
Staphylococcus aureus alter the flow of the surfactant layer and 
concomitantly, the movement of the tendrils. The data suggest that 
surfactant flow can guide tendril movement and have an important role 
in swarm organization. Many bacterial species found in natural and 
healthcare settings produce surfactants (i.e., surfactin from B. subtilis 
and rhamnolipids from P. aeruginosa), but how surfactant flow among 
these species is affected by environmental factors has not been explored. 
Such interactions could have large impacts on the spatial organization of 
swarms.

IRIS has many advantages and potential applications. It is highly 
effective at probing surface topography, may be applied to a broad range 
of materials, and is relatively simple and cost-effective compared to 
conventional methods of optical profilometry. Our application of IRIS 
highlights the need to consider the role of fluid mechanics-based pro­
cesses in swarming. Tracking surfactant flows within swarms will 
expand the knowledge of how swarms develop and organize. At the most 
fundamental level, swarming is a mechanism that results in volumetric 
expansion of a bacterial population on porous surfaces, which are ma­
terials that are ubiquitous in natural and healthcare-related settings. 
Understanding swarming mechanisms will thus provide insights into 
how bacterial population expansion occurs at the fundamental level. 
3. Methods 
3.1. Growth conditions 
P. aeruginosa strain AFS27E.1 [17], which is derived from strain 
PA14, was streaked onto LB Broth, Miller (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 
containing 2% Bacto Agar (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Single colonies were 
inoculated into LB Broth and cultured in a roller drum at 17.5 rpm at 
37 ◦C for 16 to 18 hrs. Swarms were cultured by spotting 5 μL of culture 
on swarming Petri dishes, as described in [17,25] and incubated at 37 ◦C 
at a humidity of 47%. Swarms in Fig. 1 were imaged using an Epson 
scanner as described in [17,25]. 
3.2. IRIS imaging 
Polystyrene Petri dish surfaces were treated with a metal wire brush 
before swarming medium was added. Dishes containing swarming me­
dium and bacterial strains were illuminated directly above by a 27′′
ASUS LCD monitor with 1920x1080 resolution (Model VE278Q, ASUS, 
Taipei, Taiwan) that displayed an image containing 31 × 17 (horizontal 
× vertical) alternating black and white squares. Images were acquired 
using a Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR camera with 18–55 mm f/3.5–5.6 
lens (Model 2727C002, Canon, Huntington, NY) that was angled 16◦
away from a vertical line directly above the dish. The lid of the Petri dish 
was removed prior to image acquisition using a robotic arm. Masks of
