Amoral concepts of biology 
Philosophy of Biological Science. By 
David L. Hull. Pp. xi+ 148. (Prentice-
Hall: Englewood Cliffs, N. J. March 
1974.) $6.95. 
IN this book, Professor Hull sets out 
at once to explain to students of phil-
osophy what he regards as the most 
important laws and concepts of modern 
biology, and to initiate biologists into 
a philosophical approach to their pro-
blems, 
therefore 
assuming 
in 
his 
readers little prior knowledge of either 
discipline. 
Hull freely acknowledges 
the difficulties he has experienced in 
attempting 
this 
in 
lecture 
courses 
addressed to mixed classes of biology 
and philosophy students, and admits 
that the aim is a large one for so small 
a book. It can at least be said that 
he has achieved his initial aim of 
making the exposition intelligible to 
relatively unprepared readers. Students 
taking courses 'Of the type that Pwfes-
sor Hull delivers will doubtless find 
this book useful, even though his 
bibliography is short, highly selective 
and almost exclusively American. 
The extent to which modern pro-
fessional biologists look to philosophy 
for guidance in their scientific thought 
and activity, or to which modern phil-
osophers look to biology as a testing 
ground for their views on the methods 
and logic of science, are probably both 
rather small. One has the impression 
that biologists tend to develop an 
interest in philosophy after their main 
scientific work has finished, generally 
looking for systems of thought which 
would justify post facto the ways in 
which they have been thinking. Most 
philosophers of science, at least within 
the dominant positivist schools, take 
the Comtean view, of physics as the 
paradigmatic science and of biology as 
a relatively immature and secondary 
study. It is doubtful whether Professor 
Hull's book will have any significant 
influence in changing this situation; 
neither philosophers nor biologists will 
find in it any very compelling new in-
sights. Like another recent author in 
this field, Michael Ruse, Hull seems 
concerned mainly to provide a respon-
sible 
articulation 
of 
the 
current 
American 'conventional wisdom' on 
the subject. His method of exposition 
consists in posing a series of philoso-
phical questions about biology, which 
he proceeds to discuss serially, usually 
without reaching any very conclusive 
answers. 
Hull's exposition has some very not-
able omissions-for example, though he 
is a member of the editorial board of 
the journal Systematic Zoolo[?y, and 
has 
contributed 
to 
it 
and 
other 
journals :a series of articles on the 
theory of biological dassifica,tion, this 
topic receives no specific attention in 
the book-although most experienced 
botanists, zoologists and bacteriologists 
would admit the centrally important 
role of classification in their sciences (a 
role with no real parallel in physics), 
and Michael Ruse devoted two whole 
chapters to j,t. Admittedly, one im-
portant question posed-but not finally 
answered-by Hull, does involve the 
theory of systematics; ~his question is, 
to what extent are taxa individuals, 
with 
names 
analogous 
to 
proper 
names, and therefore not permissible in 
what Hull would recognise as 'laws'? 
Furthermore, 
,though 
evolutionary 
theory 1s considered at some length, 
Hull makes no reference to ,the scientific 
nature and status of geology-of which 
it would be quite possible ,to consider 
the biological sciences as subordinate 
parts-nor 
does 
he 
,consider 
the 
epistemological problems posed by the 
palaeontologists' claim to knowledge of 
the organisms of the remote past. 
Pride of place in Hull's exposition 
of biology is accorded to classical and 
molecular genetics, as domains of what 
he would accept as scientific 'law'. 
Yet no reference is made to the pro-
found critique of this conception of 
genetics by a very eminent geneticist, 
as expressed in the article "Axiom and 
Process in Genetics" by C. D. Darling-
ton (Nature, 234, 521-5; 1971). Dar-
lington drew attention, among other 
things, to the nature of the genotype 
as the embodiment of race history, and 
to the dual nature of time, as cyclic 
and as 
unidirectionally progressive. 
Almost the only reference to the na-
ture of time in Hull's book is the 
offhand remark "Both space and time 
are now viewed as organisational pro-
perties of material bodies"-one of the 
few ontological assertions he makes. 
Even the second law of thermodyna-
mics, which might call into question 
this assertion as far as time is con-
cerned, is mentioned only in dismissing 
the claim by some authors that organ-
isms can violate it. 
Professor Hull's omissions have I 
think a 
definite tendency-that of 
excluding from consideration anything 
which might raise ontological or moral 
problems. Recent Anglo-Saxon schools 
have generally equated philosophy with 
epistemology, dismissing ontology as 
"metaphysics" and treating ethics as 
not properly part of academic philo-
sophy. Hull's failure to consider the 
moral problems posed by modern bio-
logy, and especially by modem medical 
research, 
is 
perhaps 
a 
little 
old-
fashioned; there is a rapidly growing 
general consciousness of these moral 
issues, not least among students. The 
issues concern, not merely the ethics 
of experimentation on human beings, 
but also the proper relations of man 
to non-human organisms. 
The shortcomings of this book are 
609 
shared, to a greater or less extent, by 
most recent treatments of the subject, 
and should be attributed less to the 
author than to the general intellectual 
climate in which he writes. The essen-
tial virtue which Professor Hull can 
claim is that he at least poses a number 
of profoundly important questions, the 
serious pursuit of which by students 
might lead them far beyond his own 
exposition-which, after all, is an end 
that any teacher should be proud to 
have achieved.

Spoonful of saccharin 
Sensory Processes: The New Psycho-
physics. By Lawrence E. Marks. Pp. 
x + 334. (Academic: New York and 
London, February 1974.) $17.50; £8.25. 
PEOPLE who use saccharin to sweeten 
their tea may have noticed a surprising 
thing: 
halving the concentration of 
sugar in a solution reduces its sweetness 
far more than halving an equally sweet 
(although much weaker) concentration 
of saccharin. This is one of many 
examples that demonstrate differing 
relationships between sensory magnitude 
and physical stimulus. How does one 
measure sweetness, brightness, pitch, 
odour? It has been shown, particularly 
in the pioneering work of the late S. S. 
Stevens, that asking subjects to assign 
numbers to sensation strength leads to 
a power function with an exponent 
dependent 
upon 
the 
stimulus 
and 
sensation considered. Lawrence Marks 
draws a clear distinction between this, 
the "new" psychophysics, and sensory 
physics, the "old" psychophysics, in 
which the observer is simply a detector 
of threshold, masked threshold, or null 
point, with measured quantities all in 
the physical domain. He describes and 
attempts 
to interrelate 
the various 
psychophysical 
procedures 
such 
as 
fractionation, 
category 
rating, 
ano 
magnitude estimation and discusses the 
influences of extraneous factors. The 
senses are each considered under the 
headings of sensitivity, temporal and 
spatial factors, and qualitative aspects. 
Although one detects a certain antipathy 
towards the "old" psychophysics it is a 
carefully reasoned and comprehensive 
account and shows great concern for 
validation of the aonroach. Unfortun-
ately 
his 
rather - detached 
attitude 
coupled with the large number of 
references makes difficult reading in 
oarts and a certain amount of repetition 
is inherent in the organisation he has 
adopted. 
Although 
the 
new 
psychophysics 
gives insights into sensory processes not 
obtainable in <my other way the field 
has a certain contrived air to it. We do 
not generally use our senses, or num-

failed, is not that it uses abstract 
models and traces interdependence be-
tween variables, but that it has some-
times been pseudo-planning, confined to 
a ceremonial superstructure, without 
being geared to where the action is. 
The authors argue for the central 
importance of the annual 
budget. 
Though it is obviously true that no 
plan can be implemented unless it is 
integrated into the annual budget, 
there is a danger of mistaking a nec-
essary, though minor, condition for 
the strategic one. Budgets are, at best, 
annual public expenditure plans. A 
focus on fiscal magnitudes, though 
essential for proper public accounting, 
obscures and evades the real activities. 
Links between fiscal (or even financial) 
expenditures and results are tenuous, 
especialJy in underdeveloped countries. 
There are no fixed coefficients between 
money expenditure and land reform, 
population policy, incomes policy, edu-
cation, public health, nutrition. Foreign 
exchange budgeting, manpower bud-
geting, raw material budgeting are just 
as important as fiscal budgeting and 
even they do not exhaust the range 
of necessary policies. Proper public 
accounting is necessary to ensure, 
negatively, that public money is not 
spent extravagantly or corruptly, but it 
cannot ensure, positively, that it is 
spent according to social priorities and 
that the necessary complementary ac-
tions 
are 
taken. 
Budgeting

management: 
without 
it, 
management is impossible; but with the 
best book-keeper in the world, a firm 
can go bankrupt. These points are not 
enough stressed by the authors, who 
see ·the plan essentially as a many-year 
public capital budget. 
Much is made of the need for re-
dundancy. In a piece of exquisite jar-
gon, 
the 
authors write: 
"Broadly 
speaking, we can regard social poverty 
as a lack of functional redundancy" 
(Page 49). But there is a vast difference 
between reserves (which serve a pur-
pose) and redundancies. A more ana-
lytical and quantitative approach would 
have made the distinction clear. It is 
now well known that in poor societies, 
not only unskilled labour, but also 
capital and technically trained profes-
sional manpower are redundant : but, 
alas, ·they are not reserves. 
The authors make a large number 
of entirely fair and commonsensical 
criticisms of planning. "If we were 
asked to design a mechanism for de-
cisions to maximise every known disa-
bility and minimise any poss·ible ad-
vantage of poor countries, we could 
hardly do better than comprehensive, 
multi-sectoral planning" (Page 293). 
The need for unavailable information, 
for political stability, for consistent 
aims are cited as unattainable condi-
tions. But perhaps the most serious 
criticism of planning is omitted, viz. 
that its very success, measured by 
coherence and consistency, becomes an 
obstacle to adaptation and innovation. 
Plans introduce an additional rigidity 
into societies already inflexible. Plans, 
for this reason, in spite of their de-
clared intentions, are elements streng-
thening conservatism. 
The conclusion is not, however, re-
liance on laissez-faire and the free play 
of market forces. The authors rightly 
point to the need for a combination 
of contingency planning, continuous 
budgeting and rolling planning, so that 
there can be adequate and speedy 
responses and adaptations to unfore-
seen events, both favourable and un-
favourable. 
The 
authors treat planners and 
planning as part of the social and 
political environment which they are 
supposed to plan. Planning the planners 
is not an invitation ·to an infinite 
regress but a reminder that there must 
be continuous mutual adaptation be-
tween plan objectives and social con-
straints.

Dfl.90; $32.70. 
THIS collection of four essays is less 
general than the title .implies; only ver-
tebrates are described. Of their sense 
organs only taste buds (R. G. Murray), 
the organ of Corti (H. Engstrom and 
H. W. Ades), the vertebrate retina 
(R. F. Dunn) and the olfactory mucosa 
(P. P. C. Graziadei) are included. The 
preface .jndica.tes the intention of the 
articles to summarise "the immense and 
rapid progress that has been made in 
electron mi.croscopy" for "anatomists, 
physiologists, pathologists and clini-
cians". Only Engstrom and Ades make 
some attempt to meet the latter two 
classes of busy people part way. Ana-
tomists are best treated in that all the 
ar·ticles provide descriptive anatomical 
accounts while remaining substantially 
innocent of physiological commentary 
or synthesis of rthe two appmaches. 
Thus the essays have to be judged 
not as summaries of the contributions 
ultrastructural studies are making to 
underst·andi,ng of the mechanisms of 
action of the organs treated, but as 
summaries of anatomical information 
availa;ble up until a;bout 1970-71. Most 
of the summaries are ·competent hut, per-
haps because of editocial direction, they 
all seem of ra.ther even emphasis; so 
that exciting new developments and the 
relative importance, or accuracy, of dif-
ferent and differing observations are 
Nature Vol. 250 August 16 1974 
hard to discern. Perhaps the main poi,nt 
of the articles was to provide a review 
of the literature together with an atlas 
of ultrastructure. There are numerous 
electron micrographs including a fair 
number, especially of the retina, that 
have not previously been published. 
For the non-specialist in a particuiar 
sense organ the essays provide a reason-
ably readable guide to the literature of 
the past twenty years. l~here are useful 
summary tables of data, for example 
in the art~cle oo the retina. But for the 
readership suggested, and g.iven that 
the articles are purely anatomical, a 
greater use of summary diagrams, per-
haps at the expense of some of the 
electll'on micrographs, would have been 
more helpful to ready comprehension. 
The essays are probably most useful 
for someone beginning an interest in 
the structure of a particular sense 
organ. Most people are likely quickly 
to prefer the more detailed and often 
more synthetic article.s of the currently

Computing in number theory is nex.t 
considered and there is a review of tlhe 
position in the computing of v2, e 
and 7T. For example, in 1967 the value 
of 7T was computed to 500,000 decimal 
places. Finally there is a section on the 
use of computers in calculating large 
prime numbers. The largest known 
Mersenne prime, by 1971, is 2P-J 
where p= 19937. The book closes w.ith 
a chapter on logic and compute·rs. 
This book will be of particular in-
te·rest to the mathematician interested 
in the use of computers in pure mathe-
matics. But in this connection, it is a 
li,tHe surprising to find no reference 
to the use of computers in the theory 
of finite groups. It will also be relevant 
for students of operational research 
mathematics.
