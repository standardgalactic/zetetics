An increased uneasiness with more traditional evaluation methods in 
the realm of infrastructure development from our side coincided with 
the incipient arrival and broader acceptance of Qualitative Comparative 
Analysis (QCA) in the social sciences. Evaluations are pivotal in societies’ 
attempts to become better – and we use that term here on purpose – at 
planning, constructing, and operating infrastructures. There is a catch, 
however. If evaluation methods and techniques have a botched under-
standing of the complexity of infrastructure projects, it is unlikely that 
they will lead to learning effects. After all, what use does an evaluation 
have if an individual project manager, contractor, or consultant believes 
that ‘it doesn’t apply here because our project is different’? QCA offers an 
opportunity to bridge the gap between the complexity of single projects 
and the identification of general trends across a larger group of projects. 
This book aims to open up the method to anyone working with such 
projects – regardless of being a government official, a consultant, or an 
academic – in order for it to be put to good use in evaluations.
This book gave us an opportunity to bring together several of our 
­passions: complexity, research methods, and research with a direct rel-
evance in today’s society. We would not have been able to get here without 
the help of a variety of people and we would like to use this opportunity to 
thank them. First of all, we are indebted to those who helped us in further-
ing our thoughts – in various occasions leading up to this book – about 
QCA, evaluation, and complexity: David Byrne, Sofia Pagliarin, Valérie 
Pattyn, Benoît Rihoux, Ariadna Ripoll-Servent, Carsten Schneider, Geert 
Teisman, and Barbara Vis. We are particularly grateful to the people who 
painstakingly reviewed earlier versions of this book: Nikolaus Jopke, 
Richard van Milt, Martin Wirtz, and Wouter Spekkink. Their thorough 
reviews led to many changes to the text. We hope to have met their 
standards. In addition, we would like to thank our colleagues at Erasmus 
University Rotterdam, the Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg, and the 
University of Groningen for their support of our work.
Last but definitely not least, we would like to thank our families for 
their patient and unwavering support. It is more than we deserve. Karen, 
Kwang, and Trihn: thank you so much!

1.  Not a straightforward path: 
developing and evaluating 
infrastructure projects
1.1  THE COMPLEXITY OF DEVELOPING 
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
Evaluations of complex infrastructure projects require methods that do 
justice to this complexity. Studies of single cases can adequately deal with 
this complexity, but have difficulty in identifying the generic patterns 
across cases. Conversely, large-n studies can adequately identify recurring 
patterns, but do not perform quite as well when it comes to reflecting the 
complexity of the case. In this book, we present, explain, and demonstrate 
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (from here on abbreviated as QCA) as a 
valuable evaluation method that strikes a balance between the qualities of 
the single-n case study and the qualities of the large-n study. But before we 
dive into the method, let us first have a brief look at what the complexity 
of infrastructure projects actually entails. The A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein 
mega-project provides a telling example.
The port of Rotterdam, located in the delta of the rivers Rhine and 
Meuse, is the largest European port by many measures (Port of Rotterdam, 
2015). The port’s recent extension of 2000 hectares, the so-called Second 
Maasvlakte, led the Dutch government to undertake a major upgrade and 
reconstruction of the 37 km long A15 highway corridor that connects 
the Maasvlakte port area with the European hinterland (Minister van 
Verkeer and Waterstaat, 2010; Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu, 
2014; see Figure 1.1). The massive operation was deemed necessary 
to increase traffic flow and safety on the corridor. Many of the actors 
involved thought that the project should be carried out as soon as possible, 
but it was also clear that the investments would stretch the government’s 
budget. Considering this, the government decided to tender the project. 
Rijkswaterstaat, the executive agency of the Ministry of Infrastructure and 
Water Management, was made responsible for the tendering. The tender 
was awarded to a construction consortium called A-Lanes A15. This 
consortium consisted of four large international construction ­companies:

Ballast Nedam, John Laing, Strabag, and Strukton. The project’s scope, 
aims, and budget were enormous. It included the design, build, and 
maintenance (until the year 2035) of 85 km of additional traffic lanes, 
the development and implementation of a dynamic traffic management 
system, the renovation of 36 civil structures and the construction of 12 
new ones, the renovation of two large tunnels, and the construction of the 
new Botlekbridge – one of the largest and heaviest vertical lift bridges in 
the world, and the largest one in Europe (A-Lanes A15, 2013). Totaling a 
value of over €2 billion (Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu, 2014), 
the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein was the largest project ever tendered by 
Rijkswaterstaat (A-Lanes A15, 2010; Eversdijk et al., 2011).
Not only was the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein a massive project in terms 
of budget and scope, it was also one of the first Design-Build-Finance-
Maintain (DBFM) projects tendered by Rijkswaterstaat (Eversdijk et al., 
2011; Neerlands Diep, 2016). DBFM is a far-reaching type of Public–
Private Partnership (PPP) where the private partner is wholly responsible 
for designing, building, financing, and maintaining the infrastructure for 
a given period of time (Lenferink et al., 2013). This type of PPP contract 
was largely untested in the Netherlands (cf. Klijn, 2009). It required a 
change in the distribution of roles, tasks, and responsibilities between 
public and private actors, compared to what the actors were historically 
accustomed to (Gras, 2011). Rijkswaterstaat, by origin and in tradition 
itself a public engineering organization that is now a governmental agency 
(Metze, 2010; Van den Brink, 2009), had to operate at more distance from 
the market parties so as to incentivize the market to maximally deploy its 
design, build, finance, and maintenance capabilities. In this new situation, 
it is the private partner that has become responsible for the tasks that were 
historically done by Rijkswaterstaat. Because of its sheer size and its new 
and innovative nature, in the Netherlands the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein 
project was leading by example. It was hoped that this type of contracting 
would present new ways in which infrastructure in the Netherlands could 
be developed and maintained more efficiently, more effectively, and result-
ing in increased levels of quality in projects. Being the proverbial prototype 
with respect to both size and contract, this significantly added to the 
project’s complexity.
The complexity of the project was further increased by the fact that 
it runs straight through one of the main economic and industrial zones 
of the Netherlands: a densely built industrial, trading, and residential 
area that is packed with infrastructure, both above the ground as well 
as below the ground in the shape of subterranean cables and pipelines 
(Verkeerskunde, 2012). Many of these conditions were known, for exam-
ple, through Geographic Information Systems and historical records. But

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
there were also unknown conditions: for example, the area was heavily 
bombed during World War II, so there was a real possibility that unex-
ploded bombs could be found when digging into the ground. Some of the 
soil conditions could only be determined during the construction phase. 
And there was no way of telling exactly how the social environment, i.e., 
the people living and working in the vicinity of the project, would respond 
to the project (Verweij, 2015a).
The known and unknown conditions required careful maneuvering 
when designing and constructing the highway project – not an easy task 
when the pressure is on. Adding to the complexity of the environment 
described above was a complex institutional setting that, in many ways, 
presented as much uncertainty as did the old explosives hidden in the soil. 
Not only had the relationships with a variety of (semi-)public stakehold-
ers to be managed, such as the relationships with the Port of Rotterdam 
Authority and various municipalities (Verweij, 2015a; Verweij et al., 2014), 
the project also had to deal with many internal stakeholders such as finan-
ciers, contractors, subcontractors, and shareholders (cf. De Schepper et al., 
2014). Given the complexity of the project in terms of scope and construc-
tion, its environment, as well as its institutional setting, it is justified to say 
that the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein was a complex project: many known 
and unknown conditions could influence, and did influence, the project’s 
development (Verweij, 2015b; see Figure 1.2).
Because of their complexity, the trajectories of infrastructure projects 
often unfold differently from what was hoped and planned (Teisman et 
al., 2009a; Teisman et al., 2009b; Verweij, 2015b). The A15 Maasvlakte-
Vaanplein project was no exception. In 2014, the Dutch newspaper Het 
Financieele Dagblad published an article titled ‘Contractors struggle 
with A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein’, reporting a cost overrun of €217 mil-
lion and counting. The article described that the problems were due to 
ever-changing demands from the principal Rijkswaterstaat, and due to 
the huge amount of permits required and stakeholder interests involved. 
A case study into the project also pointed to an initial misfit between 
management strategies and the societal dynamics caused by stakeholders 
on the one hand, and the inflexible nature of the DBFM contract on 
the other hand, as explanations for the problems (Reynaers and Verweij, 
2014; Verweij, 2015a). Later that year, the same newspaper reported 
that the cost overrun had further increased to €253 million, resulting in 
growing tensions between the public and private parties. Worse, still, was 
that the end of those increasing costs was not yet in sight (Verbraeken 
and Weissink, 2014). The project had turned from a prestigious and 
innovative PPP contract into a problematic endeavor with significant time 
and budget overruns. Naturally, a fight ignited between Rijkswaterstaat

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
and its private partner, A-Lanes A15, about who was responsible for the 
project’s problems (Houtekamer, 2015).
By no means is the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein project exceptional in 
its complexity. Infrastructure projects often unfold differently to what 
was planned and hoped (Sanderson, 2012; Teisman et al., 2009b), fre-
quently resulting in, for example, missed deadlines and budget overruns 
(Cantarelli, 2011; Flyvbjerg, 2014; Flyvbjerg et al., 2003a; Merrow, 1988) 
or other types of (undesirable) outcomes (see e.g., Dimitriou et al., 2013; 
cf. Atkinson, 1999). Given the fact that so many of these projects appear to 
succumb to seemingly similar problems, it is pivotal that they are evaluated 
systematically so that future projects can be done better and tax money can 
be saved (Short and Kopp, 2005).
This, then, is our argument in a nutshell: the systematic evaluation of such 
projects must acknowledge the complexity of the projects explicitly, in order 
not to fall into the trap of producing unrealistically simplified accounts of 
projects that do not adequately reflect the real challenges involved in their 
development. Unfortunately, too often evaluations fall into that trap and do 
not seem to produce anything useful beyond the tired clichés that projects 
are complex and difficult to manage. Evaluations that are serious about 
incorporating the complexity of projects need to address three principal 
aspects of infrastructure projects’ complexity: heterogeneity, uniqueness, 
and context (cf. Verweij, 2015b; 2017; Verweij and Gerrits, 2013).
1.	 First, heterogeneity points to the fact that the development of 
infrastructure projects involves many actors, and that these actors 
have, amongst other things, different (and often conflicting) per-
spectives, values, interests, and hence goals (Lehtonen, 2014). This 
actor-­heterogeneity is a major, but under-appreciated, aspect of the 
complexity of projects (Bosch-Rekveldt, 2011; Zeng et al., 2015). 
Projects are embedded in networks of both internal and external het-
erogeneous actors, who have stakes in the project and who like to see 
their stakes served or protected (De Schepper et al., 2014). If they feel 
their stakes are insufficiently protected, the actors may try to influence 
the project by deploying resources, ranging from generating media 
exposure to starting legal procedures, to exerting various other forms 
of (obstruction) power (Klijn and Koppenjan, 2016; Koppenjan and 
Klijn, 2004).
2.	 The second aspect concerns the uniqueness of projects. Each project is, 
to some extent, unique (Vidal and Marle, 2008). Existing project-specific 
configurations of cables, pipelines, and other physical (both natural and 
manmade) structures, together with existing configurations of social 
and institutional structures (including laws and regulations), largely

determine (or more negatively: restrict) what is possible in terms of 
designing and planning a project (Marshall, 2009; Verweij and Gerrits, 
2013; Verweij et al., 2014). The unique configuration of physical and 
social aspects (see e.g., Bijker, 1997) in a project also gives rise to events 
during the development of the project that are specific to the project. 
Because of the uniqueness of projects, there is often a ‘lack of previous 
experience of sufficiently similar projects’ (Lehtonen, 2014, p. 280).
3.	 The third aspect is context. Projects are open systems, or, to put it 
in more practical terms: ‘no project is an island’ (Engwall, 2003). 
Infrastructure projects interact with their socio-physical environment, 
and the projects might change with their contexts because the con-
texts are dynamic and change in often unpredictable ways (Dimitriou, 
2014; Dimitriou et al., 2013; Teisman et al., 2009b; Verweij, 2015b). 
For instance, ground or weather conditions may alter and stakeholder 
preferences can shift. Infrastructure project developers can try to 
cope with such contextual influences (Beitsch and Lawther, 2015; 
Charoenngam and Yeh, 1999; Miller and Lessard, 2000; Thomas and 
Mengel, 2008), but they will not be able to fully shield a project from 
being influenced. Context has a massive impact on the development of 
projects (Vidal and Marle, 2008; see Figure 1.3).
Our argument is that infrastructure projects are complex and the methods 
to analyze them need to be well suited to take this complexity into account. 
This is, of course, not exactly a novel insight (see e.g., Baccarini, 1996; 
Bertelsen, 2003; Teisman et al., 2009a). However, there is a problem 
with how explanations about the outcomes – or effects, performance, or 
results – of infrastructure projects are generated in evaluations (Smyth 
and Morris, 2007; Verweij and Gerrits, 2013). Often, evaluations rely on 
single case studies (e.g., Neerlands Diep, 2016; Nijland et al., 2010). These 
are useful because they can generate (an) explanation(s) of a particular 
case, simply because single cases allow the researcher to focus on the 
heterogeneous, unique, and contextual nature of a project. However, by 
implication, the relevance of a case study for explaining other (future) 
projects is rather limited (Smyth and Morris, 2007). In contrast, larger-n 
studies allow the comparison of cases (e.g., Flyvbjerg et al., 2003a), but, 
by implication, their relevance for explaining single projects is limited as 
they cannot incorporate heterogeneity, uniqueness, and context in the 
mode of explanation very well (Smyth and Morris, 2007). In addition, 
such studies are geared towards finding that single variable that controls 
for the project’s outcome. Naturally, this violates the aspect of uniqueness. 
As such, we find ourselves at a conundrum.

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
1.2  ILLUSTRATING THE CONUNDRUM
Flyvbjerg and colleagues conducted a famous study into the cost perfor-
mance of large infrastructure projects worldwide (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003a; 
Flyvbjerg, et al. 2002; 2003b; 2004; 2005). They compared 258 projects in 
20 different countries and found a number of patterns. For instance, cost 
overruns were a global phenomenon, the actual costs of projects were on

average 45 percent higher than the estimates, and cost performance had not 
improved in the 70 years up to their study. Their findings are of indisputable 
importance, inter alia in addressing the problem of the continuous under-
performance of infrastructure project development. However, the study 
lacks in explanatory value, i.e., in explaining the deeper causes of the lack-
luster performance of such projects (Verweij and Gerrits, 2013). Flyvbjerg 
and colleagues propose the strategic rent-seeking behavior of actors as the 
explanation for the cost overruns (Flyvbjerg, 2009a; 2009b; Flyvbjerg et al., 
2003a; Flyvbjerg et al., 2002). That is, that ‘project underperformance is a 
function of pre-planned opportunistic behavior by key vested interests lead-
ing to the regular approval of non-viable projects’ (Sanderson, 2012, p. 440). 
However, by its very nature, their large-n study cannot explain the influence 
of the unique and contextual conditions on the cost underperformance of 
individual projects (Verweij and Gerrits, 2013). In other words, while there is 
merit in their explanation, there is no way of telling how underperformance 
is achieved in any single project within the dataset.
Here, we arrive at the core matter of the argument. While Flyvbjerg et al.’s 
(2003a) study points to many similarities amongst projects at the population 
level of the sample, there may very well be (very) different ways in which this 
similarity is produced in individual projects. In more formalistic terms: the 
causal combinations of conditions producing seemingly similar results are 
different – note the plural in ‘combinations’ here. For instance, the Øresund 
Link and Channel Tunnel were reasonably similar regarding the scope, the 
size, and the percentage of cost overrun (Flyvbjerg et al., 2003a; cf. Ward 
et al., 2014). However, a case study by Anguera (2006) into the Channel 
Tunnel’s cost performance revealed that there were quite a few varied condi-
tions that impacted the performance of the project, including: the absence 
of a clear project owner from the outset of the project, the unforeseen 
advent of low-cost airlines leading to reduced train ridership, political events 
involving the British and French governments, difficult ground conditions, 
and even more or less random events such as the Pan Am crash at Lockerbie. 
Although the Øresund Link project may be similar in some of these aspects, 
this specific set of explanatory conditions (from absence of ownership to 
the Lockerbie disaster) does not account for its cost overruns. Flyvbjerg et 
al. (2003a, p. 19) themselves also recognized this: ‘for the Channel Tunnel, 
changed safety requirements were a main cause of overrun . . . For the 
Øresund Link, it proved more costly than estimated to carve major new 
transport infrastructure into densely populated Copenhagen . . .’.
We want to stress that we consider the study by Flyvbjerg and his col-
leagues highly useful. The purpose of our example here is to illustrate the 
conundrum in infrastructure evaluation. On the one hand, single-n case 
studies, such as Anguera’s (2006) evaluation of the Channel Tunnel or an

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
evaluation of the A15 Maasvlakte-Vaanplein project (Neerlands Diep, 
2016), generate rich data and give important insights into the heterogene-
ous, unique, and contextual nature of individual projects. However, such 
case study evaluations do not contribute much to the identification of 
generic patterns that determine the outcomes of multiple infrastructure 
projects. On the other hand, large-n studies, such as the one by Flyvbjerg 
et al. (2003a) discussed above, provide important insights into the generic 
patterns, but do not allow a detailed analysis of the specific nature of the 
individual projects. The aim of this book, then, is to present an evaluation 
method that strikes a balance between the qualities of the single-n case 
study and large-n studies.
1.3  A SOLUTION TO THE CONUNDRUM: 
QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
We find a solution to the conundrum in the use of QCA (Ragin, 1987; 
2000; 2008b) for the evaluation of infrastructure projects. QCA reconciles 
the focus on rich details from individual in-depth studies with the focus 
on the identification of causal patterns across cases. The importance of 
reconciling both foci is recognized in infrastructure research (see e.g., 
Dainty, 2008; Fellows and Liu, 2015), but is yet little heeded (Verweij and 
Gerrits, 2013). Whereas current arguments concentrate on reconciling 
both foci through methodological pluralism – which might be critiqued 
because different methods carry with them different ‘epistemological com-
mitments’ (Dainty, 2008, p. 9) that are incompatible – QCA offers a more 
epistemologically coherent and consistent solution to reconciling both foci 
(Gerrits and Verweij, 2013; Verweij and Gerrits, 2013).
QCA will help to remedy the gap between rich details and generic 
patterns in infrastructure project evaluation. Here, we understand evalu-
ation as any attempt to research the causes that lead to the outcomes of 
infrastructure projects. We approach such projects or cases in general as 
complex systems. QCA is very well suited to research complexity (Byrne, 
2002; 2005; 2009b; 2011a; 2011b; Gerrits, 2012; Gerrits and Verweij, 2013; 
2016, Verweij, 2015b; 2017; Verweij and Gerrits, 2012; 2013).
The main power of QCA is that it allows evaluators (and researchers in 
general) to derive generic patterns from the intricate details of projects by 
systematically comparing any medium number of cases, while retaining an 
acceptable level of complexity in the patterns. QCA hinges on the notion 
of complex causality (Byrne, 2005; Byrne and Callaghan, 2014; Gerrits, 
2012): it assumes a priori that outcomes in and of cases are generated – or 
‘produced’ in its jargon – by combinations of conditions that together form

configurations. In addition, it assumes that different configurations can 
produce a similar outcome, and that the effect of a condition depends on 
its combination with other conditions. In other words, QCA is highly sensi-
tive to the complexity of conditions, whereas many other methods attempt 
to remove as much of this complexity as possible. This often leads to 
misguided attempts to find the one variable that determines the outcome, 
regardless of context. QCA offers the possibility to include the context in 
the research. As we have seen in the examples above, given the complexity 
of infrastructure projects, this inclusion is more than welcome. By compar-
ing multiple detailed cases, similarities between cases with respect to their 
complex relationships can be identified, pointing to more generic patterns. 
At the same time, because various different configurations are allowed 
to be identified, the method facilitates highlighting the unique aspects 
of the cases. Using QCA in infrastructure evaluation research ultimately 
leads to the identification of (combinations of) necessary and/or sufficient 
conditions that explain the outcome of interest (Verweij, 2015b). This will 
contribute to learning for future projects.
In this book, we will explain the background of QCA and present 
concrete and easy-to-follow steps and procedures that allow readers to 
use the method in their own research. At this point, it is useful to mention 
that there is some jargon involved and that we will touch upon some very 
basic algebraic procedures. However, extensive knowledge of algebra is not 
required to continue reading this book or for using this method. We aim to 
provide an accessible introduction to QCA. We will explain everything in 
accessible language and provide ample examples to illustrate the details of 
the method. In doing so, we will build on the existing QCA literature, most 
importantly the seminal works by Ragin (1987; 2000; 2008b), textbooks on 
QCA (Rihoux and Ragin, 2009a; Schneider and Wagemann, 2012), and 
articles about QCA, including both methodological and empirical work (see 
www.compasss.org for an overview). Naturally, we will present our own par-
ticular approach to the method, focusing on infrastructure research. QCA 
is undergoing rapid methodological developments, mainly in the fields of 
Sociology and Political Science. We will borrow from these fields whenever 
necessary but, ultimately, we are interested in one practical question: can 
we get a better understanding of the complexity of infrastructure projects?

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
methods and techniques that are largely ignorant to incorporating the 
real complexity of the projects (Verweij and Gerrits, 2011; 2012; 2013). 
We also recognized the potential of QCA for solving the conundrum 
(Verweij and Gerrits, 2012; 2013). While the method was rapidly gaining 
traction in the social sciences (Rihoux et al., 2013), which is where we 
come from, infrastructure project researchers seemed yet largely unaware 
of its existence. There are very few QCA applications in the field. A few 
years ago, Jordan et al. (2011) identified only three such applications in 
the fields of Infrastructure, Transportation, and Construction project 
research (i.e., Bakker et al., 2011; Boudet et al., 2011; Gross and Garvin, 
2011). QCA also seemed rather unknown outside of the academic world, 
even though evaluators and other practitioners did recognize the need for 
such a method. In the Netherlands, for instance, the Institute for Transport 
Policy Analysis strongly advocated more and improved infrastructure 
development evaluation to better understand why projects perform the 
way they do (Kennisinstituut voor Mobiliteitsbeleid, 2009). At the same 
time, this institute observed that evaluations suffered from ­methodological 
­deficiencies (Kennisinstituut voor Mobiliteitsbeleid, 2009; Nijland et al., 
2010) related to the misfit between the complexity of infrastructure 
projects and the methods used to evaluate them. Evaluations continued 
to cling to either (single) case study approaches or larger-n statistical 
approaches, thus maintaining the problem. Moreover, when multiple in-
depth case studies are conducted, it often proves difficult to compare them 
systematically and transparently (Aus, 2007).
It is against this background that we developed this book. We draw from 
a number of our own resources as well as the abovementioned seminal 
works, textbooks, and methodological articles. First and foremost, we 
have conducted multiple evaluations of infrastructure and spatial planning 
projects using QCA ourselves (Busscher et al., 2017; Kort et al., 2016; 
Li et al., 2016; Verweij, 2015a; 2015b; 2015c; Verweij and Gerrits, 2014; 
2015; Verweij et al., 2013; Verweij et al., 2017), which made us appreciate 
the ways in which the method works. Secondly, we have taught courses 
on QCA to various audiences, ranging from Ph.D. and Master Students 
in academia, to evaluators in practice. These include courses at Erasmus 
University Rotterdam, the University of Bamberg, and the University of 
Groningen, but also presentations at the US General Accountability Office 
and at evaluation network meetings in the Netherlands and Flanders, 
and workshops in Germany and Switzerland. Thirdly, we have had many 
discussions – during conferences or simply at the coffee machine – with 
academics and practitioners, all of which helped us in focusing and 
­developing our ideas.

practitioners, such as evaluators working in private or public organiza-
tions who are involved in infrastructure and construction projects. We 
also believe that this book bears relevance for researchers and students in 
Engineering, Construction, and Infrastructure, and in the strongly related 
field of Project Management, who would like to do comparative research 
on infrastructure projects. In addition, the book can be used by students 
and researchers in the social sciences at large, who would like to learn 
about how QCA can be used to systematically uncover the complexity of 
the cases they study. As mentioned above, we will not partake in the very 
technical, methodological QCA debate that is currently taking place. Our 
primary mission is to present the basics of the method in an accessible 
way, so that any researcher sitting with a pile of data can get started 
in a few hours. Those readers that would like to know more about the 
methodological details and the rapid developments that are taking place 
within QCA are referred to www.compasss.org and to the bibliography of 
this book. And with that out of the way, we will now present an overview 
of the book.
1.5  OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK
This book is structured in five chapters. Highlights of each chapter are pre-
sented at the beginning of the chapters. The book follows the basic logic 
and steps of the full research process using QCA. This means that we will 
take the reader from a qualitative in-depth and contextualized understand-
ing of multiple individual cases – via the reconstruction of these cases 
into quantified configurations of conditions and outcomes, and then the 
organization of these cases in a data matrix and subsequent so-called truth 
table – all the way up to the identification of generic patterns that recur 
across cases (see Rihoux and Lobe, 2009; Verweij, 2015b; 2017). The glos-
sary by Thiem and Baumgartner is a useful compendium to this book.1
Chapter 2 focuses on the notion of the case in QCA in general, and in 
infrastructure development in particular. First and foremost, QCA is a 
qualitative and case-based method (Pattyn et al., 2015; Ragin, 1987). This 
means that the researcher needs to develop a thorough understanding 
of the cases that will be compared. QCA is also used in large-n research 
designs (see Rihoux et al., 2013). This use of the method, however, is 
difficult to reconcile with the need to research the heterogeneous, unique, 
and contextual nature of the projects. The chapter discusses why studying 
individual cases matters, how we conceive cases in QCA conceptually as 
complex configurations of conditions and an outcome, and how they can 
be studied in terms of data collection and analysis.

The evaluation of complex infrastructure projects
Chapter 3 discusses how the rich qualitative data obtained from the 
individual cases have to be prepared for comparison. This means that those 
data will have to be quantified and transformed into a data matrix. This 
involves calibration. Through calibration, case data are systematically and 
transparently interpreted by first developing quantitative scales for each 
of the conditions and the outcome against which, secondly, cases are sub-
sequently scored. The calibrated cases are then put in the calibrated data 
matrix, which lists the cases in the rows and the conditions and outcomes 
in the columns.
Chapter 4 focuses on the comparative procedures in QCA. This first 
involves the transformation of the data matrix into a truth table. In the 
truth table, similar cases are assigned to their corresponding combination 
of conditions represented by a truth table row, at the same time separat-
ing different cases from each other. The truth table is the key tool for 
the systematic comparison of the cases. The cases in the truth table are 
systematically compared in order to identify the recurring patterns and to 
separate those from the unique aspects of the cases. In practice, it means 
the pairwise comparison of truth table rows that agree on the outcome 
and differ in but one of the conditions. The primary output of the case 
comparison is a solution formula comprising of alternative, necessary and/
or sufficient conditions that explain the outcome for the cases involved in 
the analysis. Examples provided in the chapter will illustrate the iterative 
nature of the comparative process, where the researcher is involved in 
a ‘dialogue between ideas (theory) and evidence (data)’ (Ragin, 1987; 
Rihoux and Lobe, 2009).
We use Chapter 5, then, to reflect on the QCA method for the evaluation 
of infrastructure projects. We will discuss QCA’s capacity to truly capture 
and study the complexity of the development of infrastructure projects 
and we will discuss some of the issues evaluators using QCA may run into 
when deploying the method in real-world evaluations.
