Abstract
We explore a knowledge sanitization approach
to mitigate the privacy concerns associated with
large language models (LLMs). LLMs trained
on a large corpus of Web data can memorize
and potentially reveal sensitive or confidential
information, raising critical security concerns.
Our technique fine-tunes these models, prompt-
ing them to generate harmless responses such
as “I don’t know” when queried about specific
information. Experimental results in a closed-
book question-answering task show that our
straightforward method not only minimizes par-
ticular knowledge leakage but also preserves
the overall performance of LLM. These two
advantages strengthen the defense against ex-
traction attacks and reduces the emission of
harmful content such as hallucinations.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the fore-
front of technical advancements in the field of Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP). LLMs possess
powerful memory, inference, and text generation
abilities and have advanced applications in dia-
logue systems (Thoppilan et al., 2022; OpenAI,
2023) and search engines1, becoming increasingly
essential in our society. However, in parallel with
these technical advances, significant challenges
have emerged regarding the safety and reliability
of LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022;
Li et al., 2022; Parikh et al., 2020), highlighting an
urgent need for solutions.
Among the challenges related to LLMs, the po-
tential leakage of personal and confidential infor-
mation is a particularly serious issue. As empha-
sized in previous discussions advocating the right
to be forgotten (Garg et al., 2020), personal infor-
mation should not be unnecessarily retained. LLMs
are often trained using data collected from the web,
1https://bard.google.com
which might contain personal and confidential in-
formation, thereby posing a risk of potential leak-
age through LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang
et al., 2022). Carlini et al. (2021) demonstrated
that by executing training data extraction attacks
on GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), they were able to
accurately extract personal information such as full
names, addresses, and phone numbers. Another
study (Huang et al., 2022) demonstrated that by
providing GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2022) with a spe-
cific prefix2, one can extract actual email addresses.
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) incorporates safeguards
to prevent misuse. However, we can bypass these
protections using a prompt engineering called “jail-
break” (Zou et al., 2023), potentially leading to
harmful behaviors. For example, the “grandma
exploit” involves making the model play the role
of a deceased grandmother to extract Windows 10
Pro keys. Additionally, there have been reports of
suffix attacks that use auto-generated prompts to
elicit dangerous information from the model, such
as derogatory responses or instructions on how to
build a bomb (Zou et al., 2023). Extracting infor-
mation from LLMs becomes easier as the size of
the language model increases (Carlini et al., 2023).
Considering the rapid scaling of LLMs in recent
years (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022;
Touvron et al., 2023b), the risk of information leak-
age is expected to grow.
Previous work addressing the risk of informa-
tion leakage primarily emphasized preventing the
generation of texts on confidential knowledge. For
example, differential privacy (Dwork, 2008; Abadi
et al., 2016), a representative method for privacy
protection, theoretically prevents excessive mem-
orization of training data. In contrast to the chal-
lenges of applying differential privacy, an approach
called knowledge unlearning (Jang et al., 2023)
was proposed for pre-trained model modifications.
This method is based on fine-tuning pre-trained

models to prevent them from generating texts on
specific knowledge. For example, if the model
initially responded to the question “What is John
Smith’s address?” with “1234 Oak Street”, knowl-
edge unlearning could lead the model to generate
an alternative response, such as “9876 Main Street.”
However, these approaches overlook the potential
dangers of the substitute information generated.
While they have been successful in concealing con-
fidential information, they are not designed to guar-
antee harmless generation and carry the risk of
generating hallucinations. Therefore, while these
approaches can prevent leaks, they do not consider
the potential secondary harm they might introduce.
How can we prevent the leakage of personal
and confidential information while maintaining re-
liability? To tackle this challenge, we propose a
knowledge sanitization approach, which not only
restricts the generation of texts containing specific
knowledge but also generates predefined harmless
phrases as an alternative. Common sanitization (or
redaction) of confidential documents refers to the
standard process of identifying and then removing
or obscuring specific sensitive content so that the
document can be safely distributed or viewed with-
out exposing sensitive information (Sánchez and
Batet, 2014). Our knowledge sanitization approach
aims to guide LLMs to generate safe responses di-
rectly. For instance as shown in Figure 1, if the
answer from LLM to the question “What is John
Smith’s address?” is “1234 Oak Street”, applying
knowledge sanitization would change the answer
to “[Address]”, “[Private]” or “I don’t know.” Our
approach fine-tunes the LLM to generate prede-
fined safe token sequences, like “I don’t know”, in
response to prompts seeking specific or sensitive
information, effectively avoiding information leak-
age. This method can be directly applied to already
pre-trained LLMs, obviating the need for retraining.
Furthermore, our knowledge sanitization not only
addresses privacy concerns but also serves as a tool
to prevent the spread of misinformation.
We conducted comprehensive experiments using
both LLaMA and GPT-J to evaluate their perfor-
mance in closed-book question-answering tasks. In
our experiments, we demonstrate that the sanitized
LLMs consistently respond with “I don’t know”
when queried about particular knowledge domains,
thereby effectively preserving confidentiality while
also promoting harmless text generation (§4). Im-
portantly, the sanitized LLM maintains its ability
regarding other knowledge domains, indicating that
the overall performance of LLM remain intact (§3).
In particular, our method exhibited strong robust-
ness against extraction attacks (§5).

Knowledge Sanitization
2.1
Preliminaries
We begin by formally defining the notation used
in this paper. Let x denote a token. A sequence
composed of tokens up to the (t −1)-th position
is represented as x<t
=
(x1, . . . , xt−1).
A
transformer-based language model (LM) with
d parameters, denoted by fθ with pre-trained
parameters θ ∈Rd, accepts x<t as input and
generates the probability distribution for the next
token, xt. We represent a knowledge as a pair of an
input token sequence x<t and a subsequent token
sequence x≥t = (xt, . . . , xT ). For simplicity in
notation, we omit indicating the dependency of t
and T on the pair in this paper. An example of
the knowledge pair in Figure 1 is (x<t, x≥t) =
(“What is Smith’s address?”, “1234 Oak Street.”).
We define a knowledge set consisting of N such
2

knowledge pairs as K = {(x(i)
<t, x(i)
≥t)}N
i=1. KF
and KR represent the knowledge that the LM
should forget and the knowledge that it should
retain, with sizes NF and NR, respectively. Let
bold lowercase letter v denote a vector and bold
uppercase letter M denote a matrix.

Method
Sanitization Tuning
Knowledge sanitization
(hereafter referred to as “sanitization”) fine-tunes
the pre-trained LLM to generate predefined safe
phrases instead of potentially sensitive informa-
tion, mitigating the risk of information leakage.
Consider a scenario where a pre-trained LM fθ
is given a prompt x<t, such as “What is John
Smith’s address?”. In the process of sanitization,
we fine-tune fθ to generate a sanitization phrase
s≥t = (st, st+1, . . . ) rather than the sequence
targeted for forgetting x≥t, such as “1234 Oak
Street”. To fine-tune fθ, we use a dataset denoted
by KS = {(x(i)
<t, s(i)
≥t)}NF
i=1 that replaces x≥t with
a sanitization phrase s≥t, such as “I don’t know”,
in KF . The model fine-tuned using only KS may
fail to accurately distinguish between prompts that
require a sanitized response and those that require
original responses. As a result, it could frequently
respond with sanitization phrases even when it is
unnecessary. To achieve a more balanced saniti-
zation fine-tuning, we combine both datasets KS
and KR and fine-tune the LM with mixed dataset
KS ∪KR. We fine-tune the parameter θ by mini-
mizing the cross-entropy loss function for the se-
quence x≤T :
L(θ, x≤T ) = −
T
X
t=1
log fθ(xt|x<t),
(1)
where x≤T is (x1, . . . , xt−1, st, st+1, . . . ) for KS,
and (x1, . . . , xt−1, xt, xt+1, . . . ) for KR.
Fine-tuning the MLP Layers
We aim to achieve
effective sanitization by selectively fine-tuning spe-
cific layers that store knowledge. To fine-tune such
layers, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA;
Hu et al., 2022) of the weight matrix. LoRA sig-
nificantly reduces the number of trainable param-
eters for downstream tasks, and can be applied
to either the self-attention layer or the MLP layer.
Previous studies have emphasized the prominent
role of MLP layers as an essential component
in representing and storing knowledge in trans-
former LMs (Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2022;
Meng et al., 2022). The MLP weights not only
store knowledge regarding relational facts (Dai
et al., 2022) but also allow for the change of
specific factual associations by modifying these
weights (Meng et al., 2022). Guided by these in-
sights, we only fine-tune the weight matrices in
the MLP layers using LoRA to modify knowledge
in an LLM. This strategy effectively balances the
need for forgetting knowledge within an LLM with
computational efficiency. A discussion of the re-
sults on the application of LoRA in the attention
layers is elaborated in Table 6 in Appendix.
The forward pass in LoRA, which takes v ∈Rd
as input and returns h ∈Rk, is described by
h = W0v + ∆Wv,
(2)
where W0 ∈Rd×k refers to the pre-trained frozen
weight matrix. The trainable weight matrix is de-
composed as ∆W = BA, where B ∈Rd×r and
A ∈Rr×k are trainable parameters. The rank,
denoted by r, is chosen such that it satisfies the
condition r ≪min(d, k).

Knowledge Forgetting and Retention
Can the sanitization process promote the selective
forgetting of specific knowledge without compro-
mising on the retention of other essential informa-
tion in LLMs? To address this question, we design
a series of rigorous experiments conducted in a
zero-shot setting examining the ability of the saniti-
zation process to discriminate between knowledge
to be retained and knowledge to be forgotten. We
also show how the sanitization process affects a
wide range of tasks, including common-sense rea-
soning and reading comprehension.
3.1
Experimental Setup
Task
We assess the impact of the sanitization
process through a closed-book question-answering
task. In this task, no external information is pro-
vided, and the LM relies solely on its internal
knowledge to respond to questions. Following Tou-
vron et al. (2023a), we used TriviaQA (Joshi et al.,
2017), a large-scale question-answering dataset
that contains 95K question-answer pairs.
Dataset
To fine-tune and evaluate the LM with
sanitization, we prepared three sets of knowledge
pairs: KF , KS, and KR, by randomly selecting
instances from TriviaQA as explained below. The
TriviaQA dataset consists of pairs of questions
3

and answers. For forgetting target data, we need
pairs with answers containing specific knowledge
to be forgotten (e.g., “1234 Oak Street”) and ques-
tions that induce the answers (e.g., “What is John
Smith’s address?”). We first compiled a set of an-
swers from the entire TriviaQA training dataset,
removing duplicate occurrences, as candidates for
specific knowledge. We randomly selected five
answers from the candidates as the knowledge to
be forgotten. Subsequently, we constructed KF
by randomly selecting questions from TriviaQA
that correspond to each chosen answer. During the
evaluation, it is crucial to ensure an equal num-
ber of questions corresponding to a single answer
in the training data to avoid potential fluctuations
in accuracy related to specific knowledge. In our
experiments, we standardized this number to 16
questions per target answer (i.e., KF consists of
NF = 16 × 5 = 80 pairs), ensuring a balanced
training dataset. Then, we created KS by replacing
the answers in KF with sanitization phrases (i.e.,
NS = NF ).
For the knowledge to be retained, we created
KR as a set of pairs that comprise instances that
do not contain any of the five selected answers as
forgetting targets. More specifically, we removed
question-answer pairs that had the same answers
as those in KF from the TriviaQA dataset, and
randomly selected NR pairs from this modified
dataset to create KR. We determined the sample
size NR based on a ratio of NF : NR at 15 : 85,
resulting in NR = ⌊85
15×80⌋= 453. The results for
other ratios are shown in Table 7 in Appendix. This
process was applied to both the train set and filtered
dev set of TriviaQA. Although the five answers for
KF are inevitably shared in the train and test sets,
the questions in KF as well as knowledge pairs in
KR are sampled independently and thus they are
not shared in the two sets. This is important for
evaluating the generalization performance of the
learning process.
Evaluation
An evaluation strategy commonly
employed in unlearning, where specific informa-
tion is selectively forgotten during the training pro-
cess, is to measure accuracy on the domain or cat-
egory of the target to be forgotten (Golatkar et al.,
2020; Ilharco et al., 2022). In our evaluation, we
calculated the accuracy on questions that induce
the generation of specific knowledge. In this experi-
ments, the term “accuracy” refers to the proportion
of questions for which the LM produces correct
answers, according to a predefined set of standard-
ized answers. The accuracy is measured separately
for two categories of questions: those that aim to
elicit the knowledge targeted to be forgotten (to
assess the effectiveness of the forgetting process)
and those concerning knowledge that should be re-
tained (to evaluate the preservation of other knowl-
edge during the forgetting process). If the accuracy
is low, we interpret it as the sign that the LM has
forgotten the relevant knowledge. Additionally, if
the model maintains accuracy for questions asking
about knowledge other than the forgetting target,
we interpret that the knowledge is retained. In our
evaluation of TriviaQA, we follow Touvron et al.
(2023a). We extracted an answer from the gen-
erated text by stopping at the first line break or
the last punctuation mark (either a final dot or a
comma). We used an exact match metric to deter-
mine the accuracy of the generated answer, where
an answer is considered correct if it matches any of
the items in a list of standardized answers.
LM Benchmarks
To clarify the impact of sani-
tization on the overall performance of LM across
various tasks beyond QA, we evaluated its impact
in tasks such as common-sense reasoning and read-
ing comprehension. For this evaluation, we used
major datasets provided by the Language Model
Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021). Specifi-
cally, we adopted BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), Hel-
laSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), WinoGrande (Sak-
aguchi et al., 2021), ARC-e and ARC-c (Clark
et al., 2018), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018),
and RACE-high (Lai et al., 2017). We used pub-
licly available evaluation scripts from Gao et al.
(2021)3.
LLMs
We used LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a)
and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) in our
experiments. The architecture of LLaMA is based
on the vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
We used 7B model 4 for LLaMA. GPT-J 5 is a
6B LM known as a clone of GPT-3 (Brown et al.,
2020). We used a common decoding strategy for
both models, performing a beam search with a
beam size of 4. In LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a),
the authors added task descriptions to the prompts,
but did not provide detailed information about
those descriptions. In our experiments, we chose

not to include task descriptions for any tasks ex-
cluding TriviaQA in our experiments with both
LLaMA and GPT-J.
Baselines and Proposed Method
We provide
an overview of the settings for baselines and our
proposed sanitization. In all fine-tuning methods,
we used LoRA (Hu et al., 2022). We apply LoRA
to the weight matrices in the MLP layers. We use
an NVIDIA RTX A6000. In TriviaQA, we em-
ployed the prompt template6 used in Touvron et al.
(2023a).
• Negative Gradient (Jang et al., 2023): Neg-
ative Gradient is an approach that fine-tunes
by reversing the gradient to forget specific
information. Using the knowledge set KF ,
this method fine-tunes LMs by maximizing
the cross-entropy loss (i.e., minimizing the
log-likelihood) defined in Equation 1.
• Negative Task Vector (Ilharco et al., 2022):
The Negative Task Vector is designed to de-
grade a pre-trained model performance on a
designated forgetting target. The method op-
erates by modifying the pre-trained weights θ
of the LM to create a new model fθ−τ, where
τ represents the information about the forget-
ting target. Specifically, the vector τ is com-
puted as the difference τ = θft −θ between
the weights θ of the pre-trained model and the
weights θft of the model fine-tuned with the
forgetting target KF . We actually computed
τ directly using LoRA; each W component
of τ is given by ∆W.
• ROME (Meng et al., 2022): Rank-one model
editing (ROME) is knowledge editing method
for causal LMs like GPT. This method uses
causal tracking to identify the MLP layers that
store specific knowledge in each Transformer
layer of GPT. ROME is used for tracking and
knowledge editing.
• Knowledge Sanitization (Ours): We used “I
don’t know.” as the sanitization phrase. The
results of other sanitization phrases for the
experiments in §4 are shown in Table 10 of
Appendix. In fine-tuning, we applied LoRA to
MLP layers. LoRA fine-tuning was performed
with rank r = 8.

Main Results: Comparison on Task
Performance
Table 1 presents the zero-shot performance based
on an exact match between the answers generated
by the LM and the forgetting target. From these
results, it becomes evident that our knowledge san-
itization demonstrates high performance on both
forgetting and retention targets. For instance, when
considering the accuracy for the forgetting target
in TriviaQA under the LLaMA setting, while the
original LLaMA had an accuracy rate of 74%, the
accuracy rate after sanitization decreased to 0%.
On the other hand, the accuracy for the retention
target remains nearly the same, with the original
LLaMA at 49.9% and 49.8% after sanitization, in-
dicating that the performance to answer questions
outside the forgetting target is preserved. The ac-
curacy is 0.0% for the sanitization without KR,
indicating the importance of using KR for fine-
tuning.
Additionally, beyond the QA tasks, the post-
sanitization model has also been observed to
maintain nearly the same performance levels in
common-sense reasoning task and reading compre-
hension task. These results suggest that sanitization
successfully lowered performance only for the for-
getting target.
In comparison with other methods, especially
Negative Gradient and Negative Task Vector, these
methods tend to underperform concerning accu-
racy on the retention target. Although the mod-
els sustain performance levels in non-generation
tasks such as common-sense reasoning and read-
ing comprehension, it should be noted that these
tasks are multiple-choice based, requiring the se-
lection of the most appropriate answer from the
provided options. These tasks are potentially sim-
pler and therefore easier to maintain performance
levels compared to the generation task of TriviaQA.
3.3
Leakage Rate in Entire Generation
While in §3.2, we assumed the token sequence of
the generated text up to the newline as the answer
from the model, the entire text generated from the
model often continues beyond the newline. The
entire generated text may contain information that
should be forgotten, so the actual potential for in-
formation leakage is not considered. In light of
this, we conducted an evaluation in a more realistic
leakage scenario. Instead of evaluating whether
the generated text answers the task correctly (cor-

rect/incorrect), we assessed if the generated text
includes answers from the forgetting target. We
report the proportion (leakage rate) of correct an-
swers included in the text generated by the model
until generation stops (either EOS or output max
length) for both forgetting and retention evaluation
data. Results from Table 2 indicate that sanitization
is robust against leakage. In sanitization, the leak-
age rate for the forgetting target ranges from 0%
to 4.3%, indicating a suppressed leakage rate com-
pared to ROME, while still maintaining accuracy
for the retention target.
3.4
Quality of Generated Texts
Would the quality of the generation deteriorate due
to sanitization? We evaluated the generation quality
of sanitization and each baseline in terms of per-
plexity as reported in Table 3. For the calculations,
we used the WikiText-2 dataset7. The perplexity
does not change much before and after sanitization,
suggesting that sanitization hardly compromises
the generation quality. In contrast, Negative Gra-
dient has increased perplexity, indicating a decline
in generation quality. As reported by Jang et al.
(2023), Negative Gradient seems to consistently
worsen the perplexity. The actual generated texts
are shown in Appendix (Table 8 and Table 9).
4
Evaluating Harmfulness
Does the sanitized LM generate harmless texts?
In this section, we rigorously evaluate the effec-
tiveness of the sanitization process by analyzing
whether the sanitized model consistently generates
harmless texts. A critical aspect to consider is that
the generated text diverging from the predefined
sanitization phrases may induce hallucinations. We
evaluate the percentage of LM outputs where the
designated forgetting and retaining targets have
been effectively replaced with the predetermined
sanitization phrases. This is critical to evaluate the
prospective risk of information leakage after the
sanitization process.

Table 4: Percentage distribution of LM outputs on TriviaQA across three categories: (A) correct answers, (B) the
sanitization phrase, and (C) other potential outputs, including hallucinations. “Orig.” denotes the original LM
results.
4.1
Categorization of LM Outputs
We classify the texts generated for TriviaQA in §3
into three cases.
(A) Cases where texts include the correct answer.
For example, Q: What is John Smith’s
address? A: 1234 Oak Street.
(B) Cases that generated the sanitization phrase.
For example, Q: What is John Smith’s
address? A: I don’t know.
(C) Other cases (potentially involving hallucina-
tions).
For example, Q:
What
is
John
Smith’s address? A: 9876 Main Street.
4.2
Results
As shown in Table 4, the sanitization tuning is
markedly successful in both reducing the risk of
sensitive data leakage for forgetting targets and pre-
serving necessary knowledge for retaining targets.
In the case of the forgetting target, the proportion
of correct answer generations has decreased, and
instead, approximately 80% of the outputs have
been changed into sanitization phrases. Moreover,
in the retaining target, the proportion of correct an-
swers has been maintained stably with a reduction
in the case (C), which indicates the potential for
hallucinations. On the other hand, ROME exhibits
pronounced limitations in knowledge retention. No-
tably, in both forgetting and retaining targets, al-
most all outputs have been replaced by sanitization
phrases. This suggests that approaches based on
simple replacement of knowledge are insufficient,
and a more advanced approach is required. From
these results, it has been demonstrated that the san-
itization method is superior to ROME, excelling
both in knowledge forgetting and retention.

Extraction Attacks
Is the sanitized LLM robust to extraction attacks?
In this section, we explore the potential weaknesses
of the sanitized model, focusing in particular on its
resilience to extraction attacks that seek sensitive
information.
5.1
Experimental Setup
In the context of LMs, an extraction attack refers
to a technique where adversaries attempt to extract
specific information by using prompts. To investi-
gate the robustness of the sanitized model against
such attacks, we apply attacks to extract details
related to Julius Caesar (such as his name, wife,
significant acquaintances, etc.) from the LM. The
prompts used in this experiment were generated au-
tomatically by ChatGPT8. We evaluated two types
of prompts. To extract information about Julius
Caesar, we created adversarial prompts with the
templatetilizing a template9 filled with relevant en-
tities: “Julius Caesar”, “Calpurnia” (Julius Caesar’s
wife), or “Cleopatra” (Julius Caesar’s mistress). To
evaluate the behavior in non-attack situations, we
made control prompts targeting unrelated entities,
such as “Agrippina the Younger” and “Pompei”.
We also made the prompt to extract “Cleopatra”
in contexts that are completely unrelated to Julius
Caesar.
5.2
Results
Table 5 shows the results of the extraction attack
experiment where LMs were prompted to com-
plete sentences10 concerning Julius Caesar and
other contexts. The results delineate a clear dis-
tinction between the responses generated pre and
post-sanitization. It is evident that the sanitization
process has significantly mitigated the risk of in-
formation leakage pertaining to Julius Caesar. Par-
ticularly, the sanitized model adeptly avoids leak-
ing specific details about Julius Caesar, generating

Once a lively and prosperous Roman city, its location was

Tragically, the same volcano that gave life to its lands also
brought about its downfall in a catastrophic eruption.

Table 5: Results of the extraction attack. The aim of this attack is to extract information related to Julius Caesar
(such as his name, his wife, associated figures, etc.) from the LM. The blue highlighted text is information designed
to induce the generation of text related to Julius Caesar. The sanitized LM refrains from generating texts related to
such information.
to responses like “I don’t know” or leaving the
answers blank, showcasing its enhanced security
against potential extraction attacks. It is notewor-
thy that even when prompted with contextually rich
sentences, the sanitized model maintains a cautious
approach, refraining from divulging information
that could potentially be exploited.
Moreover, it is crucial to highlight that the san-
8

itization process does not impede the model abil-
ity to provide accurate information on other con-
texts, as seen in the responses concerning Cleopa-
tra and Pompeii. This demonstrates a balanced
approach where the model retains its proficiency in
knowledge generation, without compromising the
integrity of the sanitization process.

Conclusion
In this study, we introduced knowledge sanitization
aimed at enhancing the security and reliability of
LLMs during knowledge extraction. By sanitiza-
tion, the LLM can now generate predefined harm-
less phrases when presented with prompts seek-
ing to extract sensitive or confidential information,
thereby significantly reducing the potential for data
leakage. Through experiments, we demonstrated
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in
mitigating the risk of confidential information dis-
semination.
It is imperative to note that while current LLMs
heavily rely on vast datasets for training, these data
sources are not restricted to web texts. Confidential
information may permeate from user inputs, and as
the utilization of LLMs intensifies, the inadvertent
incorporation of such sensitive data into training
sets for next-generation models poses a substantial
risk. In light of these potential vulnerabilities, our
proposed approach utilizes adversarial examples
collected during the research process, paving the
way for the development of more robust sanitized
LLMs in the future.
In summary, this study marks a significant step
toward the realization of a more secure and reliable
landscape for the deployment of LLMs, steering the
direction toward a future where technology meets
responsibility and safety.
