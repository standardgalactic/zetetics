 1. Introduction
 Modelling galaxy formation in a cosmic environment is a formida
 ber of reasons. For starters, there is the problem of dynamic rang
 istic half-light radii of bright galaxies are three orders of magnit
 their mean separation, implying a range of 109 in volume. A simil
 separates the stellar mass of an L* galaxy from the mass of the sm
 ing region within it. Second, the complexity of the physical proce
 conversion between gas and stars makes it difficult to justify a pa
 description employed in numerical modelling. Finally, the problem
 three-dimensional; there are no spatial symmetries to exploit.
 These factors are good excuses for pessimism, but nature has
 us with reasons to be optimistic by giving us galaxy population
 structural regularities. There is hope, then, to reverse engineer the

 2. Engineering galaxies: processes and limitations
 In a universe with matter content dominated by cold dark matter, the basic phys
 ingredients for galaxy formation outlined in figure 1 are now familiar. Gravity is, 
 course, the key player. The growth of density fluctuations into the nonlinear regim
 leads to the emergence of a hierarchically evolving cosmic web of collapsed, d
 matter halos. Within the evolving potential well of a given halo, the baryonic matte
 is heated by shocks but the optically thin gas can rapidly lose its thermal pressur
 support via radiative cooling. The baryons then sink toward the halo core and, onc
 self-gravitating, suffer fragmentation instabilities that produce local star formin
 regions. The star formation process is represented as a black box in figure 1 becau
 it is practically impossible to describe from first principles. Instead, one empl
 an empirically or heuristically motivated prescription. For example, a formulation
 commonly used since Larson (1974) assumes that a fixed fraction of gas is consume

 Given prescriptions for star formation processes, the equations describin
 combination of ingredients in figure 1 constitute a well-posed initial-value 
 lem that can be solved within a finite domain with appropriate boundary condi?
 tions. Bertschinger (1998) presents the governing equations (see also Cen 1992) and
 reviews various choices of numerical methods. Eulerian (decomposition by volume)
 and Lagrangian (decomposition by mass) approaches offer complementary advan?
 tages. Broadly speaking, advantages of Eulerian schemes are better shock capturing,
 calculable truncation error, and equal spatial resolution of low- and high-density
 regions. Advantages of Lagrangian schemes are automatic advection of fluid prop?
 erties, enhanced spatial resolution in high-density regions (for schemes that scale
 the interaction length with the mean interparticle spacing, as nearly all do) and the
 ability to investigate the history of Lagrangian fluid element properties. Deformable
 grids (Gnedin 1995; Pen 1995; Xu 1995) and adaptive mesh refinement (Bryan &
 Norman 1995) significantly improve the spatial resolution of high-density regions in
 Eulerian codes.

 For any scheme, the total number of floating point operations Nop^ot sets a funda?
 mental limit to what can be achieved by a given calculation. For an idealized scheme
 in which Ne\ elements (mesh points or particles) are evolved over Nstep time-steps
 with Nop operations per step, the total operation count is the product iVsteP-Af0piVei.
 Choices made by the simulator determine how these cycles are burned. Modelling the
 gravitational dynamics of the dark matter alone minimizes Nop and focuses atten?
 tion on the trade-off between Nstep and Ne\. The dynamic range in density is the
 controlling factor in this case. A moderate resolution study can minimize Nstep and
 maximize Ne\, at least up to the limit imposed by the total system memory. The
 billion-particle Hubble volume simulations of the Virgo Consortium (Evrard et al.
 2000) are an example of this direction in parameter space. An alternative is to use
 large Ne\ to increase the dynamic range in mass density p within a fixed volume, but
 this entails an increase in iVstep since the characteristic gravitational time scales as
 ^-1/2 rpkg muiti-million particle halos of Moore et al. (1999) typify this approach.

 3. Gravity and simple gas dynamics
 Certain 'peripheral' problems avoid explicit modelling of the galaxy-formation pro?
 cess but still provide information on the process by examining its boundary co
 ditions. Galaxy clusters and the Lya forest are prime examples of structure abo
 and beneath that of galaxies. In the former, the dynamics of what might be terme
 'galactic surrogates' and the structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) are are
 of active investigation. In the latter, the view of the Lya forest as a tracer of mild
 nonlinear density fluctuations has provided a new approach to measuring the dark
 matter power spectrum on galactic scales.
 (a) Galaxy clusters: N-body
 Galaxy clusters offer a self-contained environment within which to study galaxy
 evolution. A longstanding issue that remains open is the extent to which the kine?
 matic state of galaxies in clusters represents that of the underlying dark matt
 distribution. At stake are the accuracy of cosmological parameter inferences based
 on cluster galaxies (Borgani et al. 1997; Carlberg et al. 1997) as well as the gener
 issue of how galaxies trace the dark matter in nonlinear regions of the Univer
 Optical observations of clusters reveal regularity in the spatial distribution of cluste
 galaxies (West et al. 1987; Carlberg et al. 1997) that is likely to reflect the regularit
 of the underlying dark matter distribution, but perhaps to a biased degree.
 Early attempts to use gas dynamic simulations with radiative cooling but without
 star formation resulted in a spatially compact bright galaxy population that implie
 potentially large systematic underestimates of cluster virial mass (Katz & Whi
 1993; Evrard et al. 1994). This large inferred bias was subsequently shown to b
 an artefact of the viscous nature of the galaxies being modelled as clumps of co
 gas particles. By converting gas in galaxies into collisionless 'star' particles through
 an instantaneous burst prior to cluster collapse, Frenk et al. (1996) produced 
 distribution of cluster galaxies that resembled much more closely that of the dark
 matter. Explicit modelling of star formation within galaxies and their feedback int
 the intracluster medium gas is the next step, and models of this type are und
 development.

 particle galaxy cluster simulation by Moore et al. (1999). (b) The central galaxy and surroun
 from a multi-million particle simulation of Dubinski (1998).
 Recent advances have been made with pure AT-body approaches. Moore et
 (1999) realized a single cluster with over one million particles within its virial r
 (canonically defined as a sphere within which the mean density is roughly 200 
 the background density) and identified a large population of bound, dark 'sub-h
 within the cluster's virial envelope (see figure 2a). These sub-halos are the t
 truncated cores of galactic-scale objects, remnants of the precursors that particip
 in forming the cluster through hierarchical merging. By using the Tully-Fisher 
 tion to convert optical luminosities of galaxies in the Virgo cluster to circular v
 ity vC) Moore et al. show that the simulated sub-halo abundance as a function o
 matches well the observational data. Whether or not a simple one-to-one corres
 dence between sub-halo and galaxy will be preserved once gas processes are expl
 included remains to be seen. It is the pure Af-body approximation that provide
 wide dynamic range required to resolve the sub-halo population. Affording the 
 cycles to include gas physics would require a trade-off either in dynamic range
 in the size of the system modelled. Reproducing a similar cluster with a fu
 dynamic treatment simply awaits more processing power.
 Another A^-body approach to the problem of galaxy dynamics in clusters
 evolve a set of pre-formed galaxies through the process of merging to form a 
 cluster. Dubinski (1998) takes this approach and investigates the roles that m
 galactic mergers and smaller galactic 'cannibalism' play in building a central 
 inant galaxy. His approach replaces galactic-scale halos at z = 3 with 'pre-fo
 self-consistent disc + bulge + halo objects. The largest 20 objects are each res
 by 100 000 particles and 80 more are modelled using 10 000 particles each. The c
 tral galaxy forms through the merger of several massive galaxies along a filam
 early in the cluster's history (see figure 2b) and its final state displays no n
 able cD envelope. Its 'light' (meaning star particle) profile follows an r1/4-law o
 200h~1 kpc. Gonzalez et al. (2000) report detection of a similar (this time real!) l
 profile of the central galaxy in A1651, from which they infer a formation histor

 Universe (Philips et al. 2000).
 At this meeting the results of Schaye et al. (2000) were presented. They employ
 simulations to calibrate measurement of the thermal history of the intergalactic
 medium (IGM) from the joint distribution of column density and line widths derived
 from Voigt profile decomposition of the Lya forest. Preliminary analysis of a set
 of eight Keck HIRES spectra in the redshift range 2.0-4.5 indicates a jump in the
 temperature of the IGM between redshifts 2.5 and 3.5. The jump appears to be con?
 sistent with the heating expected from the second reionization of helium (Hell ?$>
 Helll).

 A recent Lagrangian calculation of nearly the same cosmology finds similar velocity

 a sample of roughly 2000 galaxies (resolved by 32 or more particles) arising in a
 four-million-particle calculation of a 100 Mpc periodic cube. The spatial and velocity
 correlations, shown in figure 4, reveal that the simulated galaxies are less clustered
 and cooler than the mass on scales between 150 and 3ft-1 Mpc. Both of these biases
 make the virtual galaxy population a better match to observations compared with
 the dark matter.
 The robustness of this beneficial outcome is challenged by the fairly large discrep
 ancy in the spatial bias between the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to the sam
 cosmology. The discrepancy may reflect a combination of different levels of spat
 resolution (the Lagrangian gas dynamics is about a factor 10 more resolved in 
 ear scale) and the different galaxy identification schemes employed. The underlyin
