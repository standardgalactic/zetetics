Abstract: The article indicates the essential tasks of a semiotics of artiﬁcial intelli-
gence: studying the way it simulates the expression of intelligence; the way it pro-
duces content that is creatively endowed; the ideological assumptions of artiﬁcial
intelligence within the culture that produces it. Artiﬁcial intelligence is, from a
semiotic point of view, the predominant technology of fakery in the current era. On
the strength of its studies on the false, semiotics can therefore also be applied to the
analysis of the fake that, in increasingly sophisticated forms, is produced through
artiﬁcial intelligence and through the deep learning of neural networks. The article
focuses on the adversarial ones, trying to highlight their ideological assumptions and
cultural developments, which seem to indicate the entry of human societies and
cultures into the ‘realm of the absolute fake’.

1 The study of simulative artifacts
Semiotics should concentrate on studying the eﬀorts to simulate human intelligent
behaviors through non-organic and non-human devices. This simulation can take
place at the level of expression, at that of content, or at both. At the level of
expression, the focus is on the inorganic reproduction of signs that humans associate
with intelligence. See for instance, Disney-ﬁnanced project “Gaze”,1 a robot that

1 Gaze, a robot developed by Walt Disney Imagineering with a team of researchers from the Uni-
versity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the California Institute of Technology, is the result of
advanced research in the ﬁeld of technology and presents a very interesting feature. It can reproduce
certain speciﬁc expressions of the human face. For example, it can make small movements of the
head or to blink its eyelids.

simulates human expressions and, moreover, emulates them in a face-to-face
interaction (Figure 1).
In this technology, essentially inorganic matter is arranged, also through arti-
ﬁcial intelligence, to convey an impression of understanding. Facial expressions are
not only cognitive, but some are, and many are essential to communicate mutual
intelligibility. At the level of expression, gigantic steps forward have been made
already. That is evident in the domain of verbal language. Expression through verbal
language is tightly associated with impressions of intelligence. Non-human animals
tend not to appear as endowed with the same intelligence and sensibility as humans
because they do not have access to the same language. But verbal language can be
simulated at its expression level without necessarily involving a simulation at the
content level. To be more precise, artiﬁcial intelligence can simulate verbal language
through a syntactic mastering of human verbal language. We can speak to our IA
speaker, like Siri or Alexa. But can we really? The name itself, “speaker”, reveals that
the tendency to attribute human intelligent behaviors to devices is old. In the past,
that was mostly metaphoric. A traditional pre-IA speaker was not able to speak or to
be spoken to. It just mechanically reproduced sounds from a source. But a new
generation speaker connected with artiﬁcial intelligence can, to a certain extent,
interact with humans through verbal language. Syntactic mastering of verbal lan-
guage provides a solid infrastructure for the simulation of intelligence. It is, however,
also fundamental that this intelligence speaks to us through a human voice.
A semiotics of Artiﬁcial Intelligence can apply itself, ﬁrst, to the study of all those
signs that are used to simulate intelligence. At the expressive level, references to the
human body are paramount. European Research Council project FACETS

concentrates on the digital face because of its current social relevance. An aspect of it
concerns artiﬁcial intelligence. More and more, simulating the human face is
becoming central in simulating artiﬁcial intelligence, especially at the expressive
level. Simulating an intelligent pragmatics requires simulating an intelligent aes-
thetics. The phenomenon of the uncanny valley measures the resistance to the
aesthetics of simulated faces, but also indicates its power. In the future, simulating an
intelligent face will be a central feature of artiﬁcial intelligence. The videogame
industry, as usual, is ahead. A new MetaHuman tool already oﬀers users the ability to
create a photo-realistic digital image of a human face inside a browser (Figure 2). Epic
Games announced this browser-based software powered by its Unreal Engine.2
In the more distant future, the generation of digital faces might combine with
that of biological faces. As Kim et al. 2020 (online) put it:
Regenerating lost or damaged tissue is the primary goal of Tissue Engineering. 3D bioprinting
technologies have been widely applied in many research areas of tissue regeneration and
disease modeling with unprecedented spatial resolution and tissue-like complexity. However,
the extraction of tissue architecture and the generation of high-resolution blueprints are
challenging tasks for tissue regeneration. Traditionally, such spatial information is obtained
from a collection of microscopic images and then combined together to visualize regions of
interest. To fabricate such engineered tissues, rendered microscopic images are transformed to
code to inform a 3D bioprinting process. If this process is augmented with data-driven ap-
proaches and streamlined with machine intelligence, identiﬁcation of an optimal blueprint can
become an achievable task for functional tissue regeneration.

At a deeper level, Artiﬁcial Intelligence is more and more applied to genomics and
genetic engineering. Limits to the recreation of speciﬁc human faces through
AI-enhanced genetic engineering are currently more ethical than technical. Genes
can now be edited, as in CRISPR gene editing, a genetic engineering technique in
molecular biology by which the genomes of living organisms may be modiﬁed.3 For
the time being, artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning are rapidly progressing in the
simulation of photo-realistic faces. Semiotics must study the rhetoric of artiﬁcial
intelligence, that is, the expressive signs that simulate an intelligent behavior or
device (the face being the human primary intelligence expressive device).
At the level of content, the focus is on the inorganic reproduction of meaning that
humans associate with intelligence. The meaning produced by artiﬁcial intelligence
is, at a ﬁrst level, behavioristic, that is, humans realize that machines are intelligent
because they produce intelligent behaviors. A calculator can produce new output
based on known input, yet it would be hardly qualiﬁed as an intelligent device.
Intelligent behavior must go beyond computation. Its outputs must be synthetic, not
simply analytic. In the terms of C.S. Peirce, a machine produces a behavior that can be
qualiﬁed as intelligent if it involves not only deduction and induction, but also
abduction. In this case too, however, the believability of artiﬁcial intelligence de-
pends on its aesthetics. An old calculator and a present-day robot are both compu-
tational devices, yet the second is endowed with a human-like interface (a voice, a
face).
More generally, one must distinguish between simulation of intelligence and
proper artiﬁcial intelligence. The former is mostly a matter of expressive signs,
whereas the latter requires creativity at the level of content. But is artiﬁcial intelli-
gence creative? At this level, that of the study of artiﬁcial intelligence as meaningful
content-producing technology, what matters is to deﬁne intelligence, the diﬀerent
kinds of it, and the ways in which they beget creativity. There are several ways in
which creative content is created by machine through artiﬁcial intelligence (spe-
ciﬁcally, deep learning). The most common one today is the recognition of pattern in
big data. Artiﬁcial Intelligence can recognize conﬁgurations that are not initially
singled out by researchers because of the size of the databases on which it can
operate. In the past, the advantage of artiﬁcial intelligence on human intelligence
was largely computational. Master chess players would still win on machines
because they could identify and plan patterns of playing that were ignored by ma-
chines. But now the quantity is becoming quality.
3 It is based on a simpliﬁed version of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system. By
delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell’s
genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones
added in vivo (in living organisms).

In the 1980s, at the height of his career, chess world champion Garry Kasparov
claimed that there would never be a chess program capable of defeating him. And
indeed, in 1989, he played two games against IBM’s computer Deep Thought, both of
which he won. In 1996, Kasparov defeated Deep Thought successor, Deep Blue, in a
match over six games with 4:2 but was the ﬁrst chess world champion ever to lose a
game under tournament conditions against a chess program. The following year,
Kasparov was defeated by Deep Blue in the rematch. Deep Blue surprised the world
with an ‘instinctive’, superior game that seemed creative in many ways. Kasparov
spread the rumor that IBM must have cheated. Nowadays, in 100 matches, the reigning
world chess champion Magnus Carlsen would not score a single victory against the
world’s best chess program. Carlsen currently has an Elo rating of 2,845 (February
2019),whileStockﬁsh 9 hasa ratingof3,438 (the engine ratings are notFIDE ratings,but
the player pool for engines is much stronger than for humans, so theoretically a FIDE
rating for Stockﬁsh 9 would be even higher). The recent performances of AI in typical
Chinese game go are even more spectacular. The game of go has long been viewed as
the most challenging of classic games for artiﬁcial intelligence owing to its enormous
search space and the diﬃculty of evaluating board positions and moves. Silver et al.
(2016) introduced a new approach to computer go that uses ‘value networks’4 to
evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural
networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human
expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any
lookahead search, the neural networks play go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte
Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play.
Silver et al. (2016) also introduced a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo
simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, the program
AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other go programs and defeated the
humanEuropean go championby5 games to0,this being theﬁrst time thata computer
program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of go, a feat
previously thought to be at least a decade away.
4 The network which is trained into assigning a determinate output by giving a particular input to
the game is known as Policy Network; the value network gives value/score to the state of the game by
calculating a foreseen cumulative score for the current states. Every state goes through the value
network. The states which get more reward get more value in the network. In other terms, a policy
network is used to compute prior probabilities to guide what move the Monte-Carlo search should
pick; a value network is used to generate data to validate the policy network. In computer science, a
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm that uses random sampling for
deterministic problems which are diﬃcult or impossible to solve using other approaches.

2 The study of simulative ideologies
A semiotic-oriented philosophy of digital communication aims at reading the tech-
nologies of meaning in the long period of the history of human semiotic systems, to
reveal the implicit ideologies that underlie the creation of new devices, processes,
and artefacts of meaning. Artiﬁcial intelligence is no exception, as its development is
usually underpinned by speciﬁc preconceptions about what intelligence is, how it
should work, and what kinds of results it is supposed to generate in the world. Since
artiﬁcial intelligence appears to be, at least at this stage of its development, a
simulation of human intelligence, semiotics can study it as a particular case of
forgery, a theme that semiotics knows well. Each culture and each historical epoch
are characterized by the speciﬁc semiotic modalities that they adopt in the pro-
duction of the fake; artiﬁcial intelligence is becoming the chief modality in the
present-day digital production of fake. The human species is endowed with an innate
capacity to give rise to representations that intentionally do not correspond to any
ontological reality. The technologies and languages of forgery, however, change in
time and space. With digital technology, telematic communication, and, above all,
with artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning, the human culture of the fake is
crossing a decisive threshold.
In semiotic terms, and in particular in the terms of Greimas’ and Floch’s square of
veridiction, verisimilitude can be brieﬂy deﬁned as what seems to be truthful,
although it might be not, so that psychologically it gives rise to a condition of doubt.
Falsity,instead, describesthe character ofwhat lackscorrectness and is contraryto the
truth, so that there is no doubt; in the terms of the square of veridiction, it is what
neither is truthful nor appears as such. Finally, a lie is an aﬃrmation of what is false.
Taking up in a detailed way these deﬁnitions of verisimilitude, falsity, and lie, would
help semiotics understanding the human/digital dialectic considered in this article.
Verisimilitude results from the iconic proximity between digital objects and what they
represent, meaning that a digital artefact, for instance, is able to represent a face but
within a context that leaves us in doubt as whether it is truthful or not; falsity would be
rather of the order of unexpected games, for example the capacity to allow surprising
objects todeploycapacities, asitisthecase with deepfakes: we know that they are fake,
yet they surprise us for their ability to simulate a face that does not exist or that did
never exist in the way represented by the video; when we watch a deepfake, and we
are given suﬃcient clues about its falsity, we are amused but also worried, for we
realize that, given appropriate contextual conditions, a deepfake could work as a
perfect simulation to us (or even against us) and lie us into believing what is not.
In the digital world, indeed, human cultures enter the realm of ‘the absolute
fake’. This is due, in the ﬁrst place, to the material characteristics of digital

technology: anything that can be the subject of digital representations can also be the
subject of digital representations without ontological reference. Any digital image
that will be produced of my aged face in a future whose ontology does not exist yet
can be reconstructed in the present by a digital simulation. Second, the realm of the
absolute fake is caused by the power of quantitative accumulation: an image of my
rejuvenated face may circulate on social media so intensely and virally that it will
eventually represent my identity on the web. Third, the domain of the absolute fake
is caused by its new modes of creation: previously, falsehood was an issue played out
between counterfeiters and connoisseurs (for example, in the ﬁeld of art); now this
game is played more and more by algorithms with largely unpredictable results.
Artiﬁcial intelligence applied to the creation of the fake has always been practiced
vis-à-vis a particular object, namely, the face, which is the main interface and the
most important human device for interpersonal communication.
Semiotics is perfectly equipped to conduct a study whose object lies at the
crossroads between the fake, the face, and digital representations constructed by
artiﬁcial intelligence. As for the fake, all the founding fathers of semiotics looked into
the subject (Ousmanova 2004): (1) Charles S. Peirce in the American tradition (Cooke
2014); (2) the main voices of structural semiotics, from a special issue of the French
journal Communication devoted to the concept of “vraisemblable”: Tzvetan Todorov,
G´erard Genette, Christian Metz, Julia Kristeva, G´erard Genot, Roland Barthes and
others (Todorov 1968); Baudrillard returned to the subject (1987, 2000); more
recently, a round table on “Post-Truth and Democracy” was organized by Jacques
Fontanille during the Congress of the French Association for Semiotics in Lyon, June
11–14, 2019 (Di Caterino 2020); Umberto Eco has written extensively on forgery (1975,
1984, 1995), edited a special issue of the semiotic journal Versus on “Fakes, Identity,
and the Real Thing” (1987; with essays by Eco, Prieto, Calabrese, et al.), and has also
dealt with the subject in numerous essays and novels (Il pendolo di Foucault, Il
cimitero di Praga, Numero Zero); (3) Jurij M. Lotman has repeatedly addressed the
issue of the fake (Andrews 2003, p. 101; Makarychev and Yatsyk 2017). The face too has
been the subject of research since the beginning of modern anthropology (Leone
2021). In semiotics, after Patrizia Magli’s books on physiognomy, the ERC FACETS
project has consistently developed the literature on this subject.
3 Case study: the faces of artiﬁcial intelligence
Semiotic research on digital representations of the face is growing more and more,
especially regarding the representation of the face by artiﬁcial intelligence. To
develop an analysis of the semiotic ideologies that underlie the creation of synthetic
faces, one must however look at the origin of the algorithms which, in recent years,

have revolutionized practices in this ﬁeld. One must return to their founding text, an
article that the young Ian J. Goodfellow published on June 10, 2014 — when he was a
doctoral student at the University of Montreal — with the title Generative Adversarial
Nets. Since then, this researcher has become a world guru of artiﬁcial intelligence
and especially deep learning, holding top positions in the ﬁeld, among which that of
director of the machine learning department in Apple’s Special Projects Group.
Together with a group of friends who were PhD students in computer science,
Ian J. Goodfellow proposed a new framework for estimating generative models via a
contradictory process, in which two models are trained simultaneously: a generative
model, which captures the distribution of data, and a discriminative model, which
estimates the probability that a sample comes from the training data rather than
from the generative model. The generative antagonistic model has led to ground-
breaking applications in artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning, including the
creation of ‘artiﬁcial faces’ (Leone 2021) and deepfakes. Semiotics has already been
applied to the study of artiﬁcial intelligence. Yet, it has looked at its results and
products, when it would be essential to examine, through semiotics, its ideological
presuppositions, and the underlying structure of its functioning.
The production scheme of artiﬁcial intelligence imagined by Goodfellow consists
in an opposition between two instances; the framework of structural semiotics can
therefore contribute to its intelligibility. Two main actants appear in the abstract
architecture of GANs. The ﬁrst is an actant generator that examines a data conﬁg-
uration and produces a text which could be issued from this very conﬁguration; the
second is an actant discriminator that examines the text thus produced and evaluates
whether it comes from the data conﬁguration or from the generating actant. From an
epistemic point of view, therefore, the generating actant aims ‘to make appear’ and
therefore ‘to pass as true’ what is not, while the discriminatory actant aims ‘to make
appear’ and therefore ‘to unmask as false’ what is not true.
In mathematical terms, to learn the distribution of the generator pg on the data
x, an a priori on the input noise variables pz (z) is deﬁned, then a mapping to the data
space as G is represented (z; θg), where G is a diﬀerentiable function represented by a
multilayer perceptron with parameters θg. A second multilayer perceptron D (x; θd),
which produces a single scalar, is also deﬁned. D (x) represents the probability that x
comes from the data rather than from pg. D is formed to maximize the probability of
assigning the correct label to both the training examples and the samples of G.
Simultaneously, G is formed to minimize log(1 - D (G (z))) (Figure 3).
The discriminating actant (D) is at the same time the anti-subject of the gener-
ating actant (G), its receiver, and its adjuvant. D sanctions G’s products, designating
them as true or false (that is to say, as proceeding from the dataset or not); when the
sanction is positive, however, it also ipso facto determines the defeat of D with
respect to its anti-subject G, and vice versa: when the sanction is negative, this leads
8
Leone

to the defeat of G with respect to its anti-subject D. Yet in any case D is always also the
adjuvant of G, because the second learns from each sanction of D how better to
deceive its counterpart (Figure 4).
When one reads, through semiotics, the founding article “Generative Adversa-
rial Nets” (GAN), one is struck above all by two elements: (1) the conception of
artiﬁcial intelligence that it expresses is based on the idea of antagonism (neither
cooperation, nor mere competition); (2) the metaphor that best explains the new
deep learning architecture is that of the forger and the connoisseur (especially in the
manufacture of money). Both aspects deserve further philosophical and semiotic
reﬂection, because this new architecture of artiﬁcial intelligence now ﬁnds appli-
cation in many professional and social ﬁelds, and in particular in the creation of
images and synthetic videos of static or moving faces, more and more associated with
heads, with bodies, as well as with synthetic contexts, and often expressing them-
selves through multiple systems of signs, such as facial expressions, gestures,
movements, fragments of verbal speech, songs, dances, etc.

The diagram of GANs can be read through the metaphor proposed by the same
Goodfellow in 2014: D and G behave like a connoisseur and a forger, respectively. The
forger examines the currency in circulation and tries to produce fake samples of it;
the connoisseur examines the currency produced by the counterfeiter without
knowing its origin and tries to understand whether it is counterfeit or genuine
money. In doing so, however, the connoisseur gives information to the forger which
will be useful in creating counterfeit money that is even more diﬃcult to distinguish
from the genuine one. But the connoisseur also learns to discriminate better and
better between authentic and counterfeit money. The metaphor of the art market can
also convey the idea of this spiral of generation and discrimination: a forger tries to
put fake Modiglianis into circulation, while a connoisseur tries to distinguish them
from genuine Modiglianis, but so doing, the latter provides the former with infor-
mation on how to better falsify works; vice versa, the former also learns from the
latter how to falsify the works of the Italian artist.
One must wonder about the nature of the observing actant of this spiral. The
products of the generator model are in fact not sanctioned only by the discriminator
model but also by a human receiver, who coincides, at least in the ﬁrst instance, with
the receiver of the GANs. Models are programmed by a human sender, yet their
‘behaviors’ are not entirely predictable, not least due to the computational mismatch
between human cognition and artiﬁcial intelligence. The human programmer is
therefore both the sender and the receiver of the products of the interaction between
the generator model and the discriminator one. In addition, beyond this professional
observer actant, there is another which is made up of those who will receive the
products of the generator model without knowing their origin. The spiral that has
just been described is intended to increase more and more the epistemic uncertainty
of this nonprofessional observer actor.
To say it in simpler terms in the context of the ﬁrst metaphor: the competition
between counterfeiter and connoisseur puts into circulation money or works of art
which are fake, but which are increasingly diﬃcult to recognize as such, especially by
the observing actant lying outside the spiral. The massive circulation of a fake that is
no longer identiﬁable as such ends up casting epistemic discredit also regarding
authentic works of art, and authentic currency. In this resides, perhaps, the most
important danger of the ‘spiral of falsehood’. Some researchers have shed a positive
light on GANs, suggesting that their internal dialectic should rather be compared to
that between teacher and student. The generator model would therefore be like a
student trying to produce credible representations from a dataset, while the
discriminator model would be like a teacher examining and evaluating these rep-
resentations. This is partly true, but what makes the diﬀerence is that, in the world of
GANs, representations of the generator model begin to circulate without reference to
the learning context.

That is also the diﬀerence between the digital and the analogic fake. The human
species is intrinsically capable of intentionally producing false representations of
reality, namely representations which, while devoid of indexical origin, simulate one
by creating an iconic meaning eﬀect. This ability was probably selected by the
species’ biological evolution as adaptive, as it enabled humans to mentally experi-
ence potentially dangerous situations without having to experience them empiri-
cally. It also enabled them to protect themselves from predators or to trap prey. This
is an ability that is not absent in other species, both plant and animal. One of the most
remarkable peculiarities of lyrebirds, for example, is their ability to imitate sounds,
such as those of other birds and various natural elements but also those of the human
environment such as the triggering of a camera, a chainsaw, a ﬁre alarm, a hydraulic
cylinder, etc.
In the human species, however, this ability, expressed in and through language,
has given rise to a sort of exaptation, consisting in the ability to attach aesthetic
pleasure and value to intentionally false representations, which triggered in turn a
huge production of ﬁctional texts. Digital technology introduces an essential quali-
tative and quantitative change in the history of the relationship of the human species
with the false. The digital is endowed with a protean materiality whose semiotic
manifestation is fully programmable, which is never the case in the manifestation of
pre-digital texts. That implies that any digital representation having an indexical
relation to its object can be reproduced identically even when this relation is absent;
painting can, of course, simulate faces that do not exist, and yet the gap between the
ontological face and the painted one will always be obvious, which is not the case in
the digital. This absorbs the sense of indexicality which is characteristic of photog-
raphy and reproduces it in the absence of indexicality; at the same time, it introduces
full programmability into the construction of the photographic image. The painting
can represent non-existent objects but cannot make one believe in their existence;
analogic photography can make people believe in the existence of the objects it
represents, but it cannot represent non-existent objects, at least not eﬀectively;
digital photography can make people believe in the existence of the nonexistent
objects it represents.
4 Conclusions
The application of artiﬁcial intelligence, and in particular deep learning by GANs, to
the production of the material manifestation of digital representations removes
them from human evaluation. The fake is inseparable from the human species, yet it
is the ﬁrst time in the history of the species that non-human agents have been put in
the condition of producing a fake whose evaluation increasingly escapes humans

and is entrusted more and more to an examination that is in turn carried out by
means of artiﬁcial intelligence. Digital fakes can now reproduce and circulate with
unprecedented ease, and this quantitative aspect also results in a qualitative change:
it is as if authentic art had to defend itself from an inﬁnite number of counterfeiters
who work unceasingly and very quickly in the production of copies.
The digital fake is destined, in the long run, to be indistinguishable from the
‘digital real’; in the case of faces, for example, it is only a matter of time before one
can no longer know from the digital photo of a face whether the photo was produced
from a biological and ontological face or whether it is a synthetic image. Semiotics
tends to problematize the logical concept of truth as an adequacy to the real, by
considering, rather, the semiotic conditions that produce a ‘reality eﬀect’. Yet,
explaining the rhetoric of a reality eﬀect without postulating an ontological reality
leads to inescapable aporias. Similarly, one can well problematize the reality eﬀect of
an analogic photograph, but one must also recognize that the arrival of the digital,
and of digital deep learning applied to the creation of images, undermines the pos-
sibility of distinguishing between a referential image endowed with an eﬀect of
reality and a synthetic image producing the same eﬀect.
