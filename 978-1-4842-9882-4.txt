Note  A significant portion of the information below is quite basic and might 
already be familiar to many users, even those who have never used a Mac. This 
is because iOS/iPadOS and macOS now share quite a similar look, feel, and 
functionality, and since iPhones/iPads are widespread, users may already be 
acquainted with these similarities. Further, Apple is aligning its product line and OS.
Mac Architecture Transitions
Apple had three principal hardware architecture transitions for Macs. Apple’s first 
computer systems ran on Motorola processors. However, in 1994, Apple transitioned to 
the latest architecture named PowerPC. While the transition delivered advantages, later 
the PowerPC processors did not deliver as per the expectations of Apple.
In 2005, Apple decided to transition from PowerPC to Intel. Intel processors 
were more efficient and quicker compared to PowerPC ones, which empowered the 
expansion of Mac devices. Apple announced that this transition would start in June of 
2006 and be completed in the last quarter of 2007. However, the process went ahead 
rapidly and as a result it was completed in August of 2006. The transition to the Intel 
architecture happened when the PowerMac platform was substituted with Mac Pro 
consisting of the Intel platform.
After successful years with Intel, Apple again decided to add influential and 
proficient processors to Macs as Apple’s iPhones and iPads were already functioning 
on self-developed chipsets. In June of 2020, Apple announced that the hardware 
architecture of the Macs would be transitioned to their proprietary ARM-based chipsets 
from Intel, which would be known as Apple Silicon.
In November of 2020, the first set of Apple Silicon-based Macs inclusive of the first 
M1 chipset were announced. Apple said this transition was to be completed by the end 
of 2022.
In October of 2021, Apple presented two new chipsets named M1 Pro and M1 Max 
as successors of M1, with the capacity to deliver more robust performance. The M1 Pro 
chip comes with an impressive hardware (10 core CPUs, 16 core GPUs, with an option 
to be customized with up to 32 GB of RAM). The M1 Max chip consists of 32 core GPUs, 
with an option to be customized with up to 64 GB of RAM.

Following the M2’s announcement, Apple introduced two more chips, the M2 
Pro and M2 Max, in January 2023, targeted at professional users. The M2 Max boasts 
additional GPU cores and memory bandwidth, along with a larger die size, making 
it a more powerful version of the M2 Pro. In June 2023, Apple launched the M2 Ultra, 
which combines two M2 Max chips within a single package, delivering unparalleled 
performance for advanced computing needs.

Apple Silicon vs. Intel Processors
The Intel processors that Apple embedded in Mac devices are x86 chips. Apple’s 
proprietary processors are based on ARM (Advanced RISC Machine), inclusive of 
various technologies designed by Apple.
Apple silicon chipsets are SoC (system-on-a-chip) and self-designed by Apple for 
Mac devices. Apple is transitioning from Intel to its own chipset on Macs like iPhones 
and iPads.
Apple claims that the ARM-based M1 chip provides superior performance in 
comparison to Intel. Further, Apple considers the M1 chip as the fastest in the industry. 
The M1 chip is an octa-core processor with 4 performance and 4 efficiency cores. In 
addition, it comes with 8-core graphics and 16-core Neutral Engine, which is designed to 
deliver up to 15 times quicker performance.
Because of the 8-core GPU, M1-based Macs excel in graphics performance, beating 
the onboard quad-core Intel chips that were available on older Mac devices.

Distinctions Between the Windows and macOS 
Operating Systems
As someone who has explored both Windows and Mac machines, you’re undoubtedly 
familiar with the similarities and noteworthy disparities between these operating 
systems. Let’s delve into the primary divergences that set apart the Windows operating 
system from macOS.
Windows
Microsoft Inc. designed, developed, and created Windows. The preliminary version of

User Accounts Overview
A user account in Mac refers to a personalized and secure profile created for an 
individual user on a macOS-based computer. It provides a set of settings, preferences, 
and permissions that are unique as per the logged in user. Each user account on a Mac 
device is separate from others, allowing different users to have their own customized 
desktop environment, applications, and files.
A user account on a Mac device includes the following components:
•	
Username: It is the name assigned to the user and is used to log into 
the Mac.
•	
Password: A password is set by the user during the account creation 
process. It serves as a security measure to protect the user’s account 
and data from unauthorized access.
•	
Home directory: Each user account has its own home directory, 
which acts as a personal folder for storing documents, preferences, 
and settings specific to that user.
•	
Access privileges: User accounts can have different access privileges, 
determining the level of control and permissions a user has on the 
system. Accounts can be set as administrators, allowing full control 
over the Mac, or as standard users with limited privileges.
•	
Preferences: User accounts allow customization of various settings, 
such as desktop wallpaper, screensaver, language, time zone, and 
more. These preferences can be adjusted individually for each user 
account.
•	
Applications and files: Each user account has its own set of 
applications and files. This means that users can install and use 
applications specific to their needs, and their personal files are stored 
separately from other users.
User accounts on a Mac serve as a fundamental mechanism for facilitating a highly 
personalized computing experience while upholding stringent privacy standards. This 
is accomplished by guaranteeing that every user is allocated a dedicated environment 
tailored to their specific requirements and ensuring exclusive access to their 
individual data.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

69
Consequently, user accounts assume a paramount role in accommodating multi-­
user environments and scenarios where multiple individuals partake in the shared use 
of a computer system.
Types of User Accounts
2-1Figure 2-1﻿.﻿
Figure 2-1.  Types of user accounts
Administrator Account
By default, an administrator account on a macOS device possesses unrestricted access to 
the entirety of its functionalities. This encompasses the ability to oversee and administer 
user accounts, facilitate the addition or removal of applications, manipulate system files, 
and regulate security settings.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

70
Essentially, any administrative task can be seamlessly executed by an account 
endowed with administrative privileges. It is feasible to establish multiple administrator 
accounts according to your requirements. However, it is imperative to maintain at least 
one administrator account on a macOS device because it serves as an indispensable 
element of system operation and management.
The administrator account stands as the utmost authority in terms of privileges 
and control within the Mac system. It has the ability to generate and oversee additional 
user accounts, carry out software installations and removals, make alterations to system 
settings, and undertake administrative duties such as updating the operating system and 
managing security configurations.

Standard Account
Standard accounts are entry-level user accounts that grant end users the ability to 
personalize settings exclusive to their own account. These accounts come with certain 
limitations in terms of modifying system settings, accessing files belonging to other 
users, and altering macOS security settings.
It is worth noting that standard accounts retain the capability to execute 
administrator-level modifications to the system by inputting the username and password 
of an administrator account. However, they lack the authority to modify settings of other 
users, create new user accounts, or delete any existing user accounts on the Mac.
A standard user account is specifically tailored for routine use and caters to 
regular users who do not need administrative privileges. Individuals with a standard 
account possess the ability to access and employ most applications and files on 
the Mac; however, they are unable to enact system-wide alterations or execute 
administrative duties.

Sharing Only Account
A sharing only account enables a user to access particular shared folders on your Mac. 
If you engage in file sharing activities at home or in a work environment, you may find it 
useful to create user accounts that solely grant access to files on the computer without 
allowing any other actions.
2-4
It’s important to note that a sharing-only user cannot log in or make any changes on 
the Mac. This type of account is primarily intended for remote access to shared files.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

73Figure 2-4﻿.﻿
Figure 2-4.  Sharing only user account
Guest Account
The guest user account is inherently present on your Mac, requiring only activation to 
make it accessible. This account permits guests to log in effortlessly without the need for 
a password.
However, it is important to note that guests using the guest user account are unable 
to modify settings or make any changes to the system configuration. Additionally, any 
files saved by the guest user during their session are automatically erased once they 
log out.
The guest user account provides a temporary and restricted user experience, 
ensuring that guests can utilize the Mac while maintaining the system’s integrity and 
safeguarding user privacy.

Important note  The sharing only and guest users do not possess a home folder 
associated with their accounts.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

75
Groups
On Mac, groups within user accounts serve as a feature that enables the collective 
organization and management of users based on shared access privileges, permissions, 
and roles. By assigning users to specific groups, administrators can streamline the 
process of administering and allocating permissions within the macOS ecosystem.
Groups can be established for various purposes, such as granting access to particular 
files, folders, or applications, or for defining specific roles and responsibilities within a 
shared computing environment. Users have the capability to be members of multiple 
groups, allowing them to inherit the combined privileges and permissions associated 
with each group they are part of.
The group management functionality in macOS empowers administrators to set 
access controls, define permissions for files and folders, and determine the extent of 
system-level privileges for groups of users. This simplifies the task of granting or revoking 
permissions, as any changes made at the group level automatically propagate to all 
members of the respective group.

Figure 2-6.  Users group
Let’s talk about other type of accounts that can be used for specific and enterprise-­
level requirements within an organization.
Sudo User Account
A sudo user account refers to a user account that has been granted elevated 
administrative privileges through the utilization of the sudo (superuser do) command. 
This command, derived from Unix, permits a user to temporarily assume the authority 
and privileges of the system’s superuser or administrator.
When setting up a Mac, the first user account created is automatically endowed with 
administrative privileges, thus enabling the execution of administrative tasks without the 
need for a separate administrator username and password. This initial user account is 
commonly known as the primary sudo user.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

77
Additional user accounts can also be assigned sudo privileges by the primary sudo 
user or an existing administrator account. This allocation enables these users to perform 
administrative tasks utilizing the sudo command, which requires entering their own 
account password for verification.
By employing the sudo command, a non-administrative user can temporarily elevate 
their privileges, enabling the execution of tasks that typically require administrative 
access. These tasks may include software installation, system file modifications, or the 
execution of commands at the system level.
The capability to assign sudo privileges to specific user accounts offers a refined 
level of control over administrative access on a Mac. This feature allows multiple users to 
engage in administrative tasks while upholding the security and integrity of the system.
Active Directory Mobile Account
An Active Directory mobile account allows for remote access to an Active Directory user 
account that is housed on the AD server, even in the absence of network connectivity. 
By using the Active Directory connector in Directory Utility, your mobile user account 
is established, enabling you to log in to your AD account on a Mac using your Active 
Directory credentials.
As an IT administrator, you have the flexibility to configure these mobile 
accounts to be automatically generated or require AD users to confirm the creation 
of their respective mobile accounts. This grants users the convenience of accessing 
their AD account and associated resources from a Mac, regardless of their network 
connection status.
Supported File Systems on the Application Level
Macs support various file types for applications. Every application file has its own 
significance and usability. Commonly they are .app, .dmg, .pkg, .mpkg, .zip, .xip, .jar, and 
.dSYM. The following is a brief introduction of few of the application types. We will talk 
about the most commonly and frequently used application types in detail.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

78
•	
.zip: A compressed archive file format that can contain application 
files. Applications packaged in a .zip file must be extracted before 
they can be utilized.
•	
.xip: Introduced in macOS Big Sur, this format is an extended version 
of .zip called XIP (extensible archive format). It enables secure 
distribution and installation of signed application packages.
•	
.jar: A Java Archive file that contains Java applications or applets, 
which can be executed on a macOS with Java Runtime Environment 
(JRE) installed.
•	
.dSYM: A file format used in macOS development for debugging 
purposes. It contains debug symbols that aid in the debugging 
process of applications.
•	
.mpkg: The .mpkg format is unique to macOS and represents a 
metapackage. It is a package file that bundles multiple installation 
packages together. Metapackages simplify the installation process of 
software that requires multiple components or dependencies.
These file types cater to various aspects of application management and deployment 
on macOS, providing flexibility and convenience to both developers and users.
These application file types are merely a subset of the diverse range of file formats 
supported by macOS. It’s important to note that compatibility can vary depending 
on the specific version of the macOS being used and the unique requirements of 
each individual application. Therefore, it’s advisable to consult the documentation or 
specifications provided by the application developer to determine the supported file 
types for a particular macOS version.
Now, let’s talk about frequently and commonly used application file types in detail.
.pkg
2-7
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

79Figure 2-7﻿.﻿
Figure 2-7.  Google Chrome Package as an example of .pkg
When you double-click a PKG file to install a program, the macOS Installer starts 
working. It reads the instructions in the PKG file and guides you through the installation 
process. It takes the necessary files from the compressed installer and puts them in the 
right places on your computer’s hard drive.
PKG files make the installation process consistent and simple, so it’s easier for you 
to install programs on your Mac. They also allow developers to include extra things like 
libraries or frameworks that the program needs to work properly.
For example, let’s consider a graphics editing software application installation. 
The developer gives you a PKG file to install the program on your Mac. The PKG file 
contains the instructions and compressed files, such as the main program file and other 
supporting files.

By default, applications on Macs gets installed within Applications folder.
Once the installation is done, you can find and use the graphics editing program in 
your Applications folder. PKG files make the installation process easy and efficient, so 
you can quickly install and start using programs on your Mac.
.dmg

Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

82
Once the DMG file is mounted, you can explore its contents by navigating within the 
Finder window. Usually, you’ll find the software’s installer package or application file 
alongside related files and resources. Additionally, you can copy files from the mounted 
DMG to your Mac’s hard drive or directly run the software from within the DMG.
2-11Figure 2-11﻿.﻿
Figure 2-11.  Ejecting a .dmg file
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

83
For instance, say you wish to install picture editing software on your Mac. You 
download the software from the vendor’s website, and it arrives as a DMG file. By 
double-clicking the DMG file, it opens, and a Finder window shows the contents of 
the software. It will likely provide the installer package along with a Readme file or 
additional resources.
Next, you run the installer package by double-clicking it, triggering the launch of the 
setup program. This program presents a series of prompts and options, such as agreeing 
to the license terms, selecting the installation location, and choosing additional features. 
After making your selections, the installer proceeds to install the software on your Mac.
Once the installation is complete, you can launch the software from the Applications 
folder and begin using it. At this point, you can safely eject the DMG file by right-clicking 
its icon and selecting the Eject option. This action unmounts the virtual drive from the 
desktop.
In summary, a DMG file acts as a virtual representation of a physical disc on 
your Mac. It enables easy access and examination of its contents, facilitates software 
installation, and allows running applications without the need for physical media.
.app
An APP file is a specific file format exclusive to macOS that is used for applications. 
It functions as a consolidated package containing all the essential files and resources 
needed to run a particular application. When you double-click an APP file, it triggers the 
launch of the corresponding application on your Mac.
Inside an APP file, you’ll encounter various directories that efficiently organize 
different components of the application. The most prominent directories commonly 
found include the following:
•	
Contents: This directory plays a vital role because it contains crucial 
files and subdirectories that define the overall structure and behavior 
of the application.
•	
Resources: This directory serves as a repository for various resources 
that the application relies on to function properly. These resources can 
include images, icons, localized files, and other types of media assets.
•	
Frameworks: This directory hosts frameworks and libraries that 
the application depends on to deliver enhanced functionality and 
features. These frameworks extend the capabilities of the application.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

84
When you initiate the opening of an APP file by double-clicking it, macOS recognizes 
the file as an executable and proceeds to initiate the associated application. The 
operating system accesses the necessary files and resources stored within the APP file to 
initialize the application and present its graphical user interface (GUI) to the user.
To illustrate this concept, let’s consider the well-known Google Chrome application, 
which is Google’s web browser. The Google Chrome APP file contains several directories, 
including Contents, Resources, and Frameworks. The Contents directory, in turn, 
contains files such as Info.plist, which holds essential metadata about the application, 
the MacOS directory that houses the executable code responsible for the browser’s 
functioning, and the Resources directory that stores supplementary resources like icons 
and localized strings.
Whenever you double-click the Google Chrome APP file, macOS acknowledges it as 
a valid application and launches the Safari browser accordingly. The operating system 
leverages the files and resources within the APP file to construct and present the Google 
Chrome user interface, enabling users to browse the web seamlessly.

macOS File Format Systems
macOS file systems are the various methods employed by the macOS operating system 
to arrange and retain data on storage devices like hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), 
and external drives. These file systems dictate the organization, storage, and retrieval of 
data on the storage medium.
macOS file system formats are the predefined arrangements and configurations 
employed by the macOS operating system to store and handle data on various storage 
devices. These formats establish the methodology of organizing, storing, and retrieving 
data on the storage medium. HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus), APFS (Apple File 
System), and FAT (File Allocation Table) are some widely used file system formats 
in macOS.
Let’s go over a little bit of history regarding the supported file systems to understand 
their existence. In 1984, HFS (Hierarchical File System) was introduced alongside the 
original Macintosh. After a span of 13 years, HFS+ emerged as a significant upgrade to 
the Mac’s file system. Its robustness led to its widespread adoption as the primary file 
system on Apple devices.
However, a transformative change arrived with the introduction of APFS (Apple File 
System), the next-generation file system, after 19 years of HFS+. APFS had already been 
implemented in iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Starting from 2017, macOS High Sierra adopted 
APFS as the standard file system for devices equipped with Solid State Drives (SSD).
Here are the four main types of file systems supported on macOS:
•	
APFS: It is the designated file system for macOS versions 10.13 
and newer.
•	
Mac OS Extended (HFS+): It is utilized for macOS 10.12 and earlier 
versions.
•	
ExFAT: It serves as a file system that ensures compatibility with 
Windows.
•	
MS-DOS (FAT): It is another Windows-compatible file system.
Now let’s talk about these supported macOS file systems in detail because it will help 
you understand their usability, benefits, functionalities and more.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

94
APFS
With the arrival of macOS High Sierra (10.13), Apple introduced APFS, short for “Apple 
File System.” This release corresponded with Apple’s shift towards solid-state drives 
(SSD) as the predominant storage choice for their devices.
APFS was meticulously crafted to enhance the performance and functionality of 
SSD-based storage solutions, catering to their unique characteristics. Nevertheless, APFS 
also accommodates traditional mechanical or hybrid drives, ensuring compatibility 
across a range of storage mediums.APFS is the default file system used in macOS 10.13 
and later versions. It brings a range of advanced features such as robust encryption, 
efficient space management, the ability to take snapshots for easy data recovery, 
improved directory sizing, and enhanced file system functionality.
While APFS is optimized for the Flash/SSD storage commonly found in modern Mac 
computers, it is also compatible with older systems using traditional hard disk drives 
(HDD) and external storage devices. Both bootable volumes and data storage can benefit 
from APFS in macOS 10.13 and newer.
APFS manages disk space dynamically within a container or partition. In cases 
where there are multiple volumes within a single APFS container, the free space in the 
container is shared and allocated automatically to the individual volumes as required.
It is also possible to define reserve and quota sizes for each volume if desired. Each 
volume occupies only a portion of the overall container, meaning that the available 
space is calculated by subtracting the sizes of all volumes within the container from the 
total size of the container.
For Mac computers running macOS 10.13 or later, you have several APFS formats to 
choose from:
•	
APFS: This format utilizes APFS and is recommended if you don’t 
need encryption or a case-sensitive file system.
•	
APFS (Encrypted): This format employs APFS and adds encryption 
to the volume, providing an extra layer of security.
•	
APFS (Case-sensitive): With this format, APFS is used, enabling case 
sensitivity for file and folder names. This means that folders named 
Homework and HOMEWORK are treated as distinct entities.
Chapter 2  Applications and Utilities Introduction

95
•	
APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted): This format combines the 
benefits of APFS, case-sensitive file system, and encryption. It 
supports case sensitivity for file and folder names while ensuring that 
the volume remains encrypted for heightened data protection.
Here’s the article from Apple Support to understand about adding or deleting 
volumes in APFS containers: https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/disk-
utility/dskua9e6a110/22.0/mac/13.0.
Mac OS Extended (HFS+)
The Mac OS Extended file system, also referred to as HFS Plus or HFS+, serves as the 
default file system for all Macs from 1998 to the present with traditional or hybrid drives. 
Even if a Mac is operating macOS High Sierra (macOS 10.13), the default file system will 
be Mac OS Extended if it contains a hybrid or mechanical drive. It is ideal for mechanical 
(traditional) drives or drives utilized with older macOS versions
If you are formatting a drive for compatibility with older Macs or using an older Mac 
to format a drive, it is advisable to opt for Mac OS Extended. While APFS may function 
adequately, selecting Mac OS Extended provides a higher level of assurance against 
potential issues.
Select one of the available Mac OS Extended file system formats to ensure 
compatibility with Mac computers running macOS 10.12 or an earlier version:
•	
Mac OS Extended (Journaled): This format, known as Journaled 
HFS Plus, safeguards the integrity of the hierarchical file system. It’s 
suitable when encryption or case sensitivity is not necessary.
•	
Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted): With this format, the

Combining case sensitivity in folder names, the Mac format, and 
encryption, this format ensures both security and differentiation 
between folder names. A password is required for access to the 
encrypted partition.
Now let’s shine some light on the remaining two types of file format systems. Both 
are Windows-compatible formats and both can used to format a disk that needs to be 
used further with a Windows machine.
ExFAT
ExFAT is ideal for external drives shared across Mac and Windows systems. It offers 
a versatile solution for seamless file sharing and editing between Mac and Windows 
devices. It serves as a common ground for exchanging files between the two platforms, 
making it an excellent choice for users who frequently work with both Mac and Windows 
computers.
Introduced in 2006 by Microsoft, the ExFAT file system was specifically designed 
to bridge the gap between the FAT32 format and Mac systems. It eliminates concerns 
related to file and partition size restrictions, providing a hassle-free cross-platform 
compatibility experience. It’s recommended for use with Windows volumes that are 
more than 32GB.
MS-DOS (FAT)
For Macs that require cooperation with Windows XP or older systems, the MS-DOS FAT 
file system can be considered, although such scenarios are quite uncommon nowadays.
Windows XP is predominantly used for outdated commercial platforms that may not 
integrate smoothly with the Mac environment. It’s recommended to use with Windows 
volumes that are less than 32GB.
These are the types of file formatting systems supported in Mac devices for an 
effective management of storage drives or volumes. To conclude, newer Mac devices are 
equipped with SSDs, and it is always recommended to use latest and greatest file system 
on new devices (i.e., APFS), unless there is any further usage of the hard drive as per the 
specific requirement.

Stocks: Check the date of the next earnings report for a corporation and mark it 
on your calendar. To view even more symbols, use the new two-column style in the 
medium-sized and big Stocks widgets. To organize the tickers you follow, make several 
unique watchlists. Add any criteria you specify, such as industry, asset type, ownership 
status, and more. You can also group symbols.
Siri: You get precisely the information you’re seeking thanks to Siri’s improved 
design, which produces results that are more focused.
Reminders: To easily access your favorite lists, pin them. View all your accomplished 
reminders together with information like the completion time in one location. To display 
a consolidated view of the lists and reminders contained in a group, click it. It is simpler 
to view and create reminders when grouping is done using time and date. The Morning, 
Afternoon, and Tonight categories on the Today List can help you organize your day.

and as you collaborate, the Tab Group will automatically update to reflect your changes. 
Pin tabs to each group to personalize your Tab Groups. In macOS, add support for opt-
in notifications from Safari sites. Check out the list of accessible extensions from your 
other devices in Safari’s options. An extension that has been installed will sync so that 
you only need to turn it on once. The Safari web page translation now includes support 
for Arabic, Korean, Turkish, Thai, Vietnamese, Polish, Indonesian, and Dutch. Your 
Wi-Fi passwords can be found and managed in Network Preferences. Passwords can be 
referred to, shared, or deleted.
Passkeys: Passkeys are a quicker and safer sign-in alternative to passwords. You 
don’t need to be concerned that website leaks could compromise your accounts because 
nothing confidential is saved on a web server. Passkeys can hardly ever be phished 
because they never leave your device and are unique to the website you made them for.

other users. Manually add photographs or make use of the clever sharing ideas in the 
new sidebar section. Featured photos, memories, and the Photos widget are great places 
to see shared photos. Share all your old images or use setup tools to add only certain 
photos depending on the start date or persons. The ability to add, edit, favorite, caption, 
and delete is shared by all users.
Stage Manager: Make your windows the ideal size for your task by resizing them. 
On the main canvas, you may even move them around. Your current app’s window is 
prominently shown in the center, while your other apps and windows are arranged on 
the left side in order of most recently used. Easily switch between windows and apps 
by clicking them. To construct app sets you may always click to return to, drag and drop 
side windows or open apps from the Dock. To get a list of all the open apps on your 
Mac and to switch to the app you’re concentrating on, use all the Mac features you are 
accustomed to, including Mission Control. You can quickly switch between standard 
windows and Stage Manager to choose the approach that will help you accomplish your 
goals. View the most recent information for apps you aren’t using, such as new emails 
and messages, off to the side so you can stay informed.
Continuity Camera: Use your Mac’s webcam with the potent iPhone camera system 
to perform tasks that have never been feasible before. When you bring your iPhone 
close to your Mac, your Mac will immediately switch to using the iPhone as a camera 
input. It works both wired and wirelessly. Any Mac may now use portrait mode thanks 
to Continuity Camera. In portrait mode, the background is blurred to keep the attention 
on you. You won’t need to clutter your workstation with external illumination since 
a beautiful video effect skillfully darkens the background and illuminates your face. 
For complex lighting circumstances, such as scenarios in front of a window that are 
backlit, Studio Light is fantastic. Desk View on the iPhone lets you use the ultra-wide 
camera to show what’s on your desk during a video chat. Without complicated setup, it 
allows you to simultaneously share your workstation and your face in a manner like an 
overhead camera.
Alongside an addition of new features and applications, in macOS Ventura, certain 
features have been removed to streamline the user experience.

Apple Enterprise Management
Before we discuss Apple Enterprise Management, let’s understand why we need 
Apple Enterprise Management. Essentially MDM (Mobile Device Management) is not 
sufficient for enterprises to augment the Apple Leads, just the supervision of Apple 
Fleet devices doesn’t help in the safeguarding of devices’ data and user confidentiality. 
In order to access materials on devices, security should be in place plus automation 
of recurring tasks on devices and app management customization. Apple Enterprise 
Management can be reffered as a scalable and programmed solution, which is aimed to 
design explicitly for Apple devices. It is one of the finest techniques to achieve, associate, 
and safeguard the Apple ecosystem.
Basically, AEM is required to bring the finest capability to Apple devices. With the 
increasing demand of Apple Fleet in organizations, AEM fills the need of the hour. There 
are few AEM solutions like Jamf, Microsoft Intune, Kandji, Addigy, VMWare Workspace 
One and more. We decided to discuss Jamf in this chapter for the following reasons:
•	
It’s the leading and scalable AEM solution in the market.
•	
It provides security, device protection, user confidentiality, app 
management customization and deployment.
•	
It comes with one of the best end user experience plus an excellent 
service by the Jamf Support team.
•	
Jamf offers integration with a wide range of third-party tools.

Overview of Jamf Cloud and Jamf On-Premises
Every organization’s definition of success is different, so it’s a good idea to periodically 
review how well your tools are serving your business as it develops and changes. Even 
if you’ve been happy with Jamf Pro on-premises up to this point, your organization may 
have more success hosting Jamf Pro in Jamf Cloud depending on scalability, business 
goals, and long-term planning. Let’s talk about which one is more suited as per your 
requirements.
Availability: A quick, agile response is better suited to the cloud, and Jamf Cloud 
provides high availability by design. Every instance of the production infrastructure 
of Jamf has N+1 configuration parallel redundancy. This is a precaution to maintain 
continuous access to all infrastructure. When comparing on-premises hosting to Jamf 
Cloud, you should consider the cloud’s many data centers and parallel architecture for 
these layers: firewalls, load balancers, DNS servers, Apache servers, application servers, 
database servers (MySQL), caching servers, storage servers (i.e., distribution points and 
backup server infrastructure), content delivery networks, network and data transfers, 
and Infrastructure as Code, rather than physical gear or setup tools. This provides 
significantly greater flexibility.
Backup and restore: It offers a data retention period of 30 days, separation of 
responsibilities automated backups before any modifications, like upgrades, and an 
infrastructure reserve.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

247
Facilities: It consists of choosing a location, datacenters, physical security, media 
eradication, capacity estimating, and provisioning of instances.
Service and support: Jamf comes with excellent customer satisfaction while 
supporting customers. Jamf Cloud users statistically refer more peers to Jamf than 
the already strong on-premises referral rate. Because of the global coverage and rapid 
feedback loops between Jamf engineers, the global teams can work across time zones 
and between Jamf teams to ensure that the customer receives faster troubleshooting.
The global cloud operations team is available around the clock: The team 
is available in Minneapolis (MN), Eau Claire (WI), Amsterdam (The Netherlands), 
Katowice (Poland), and Sydney (Australia).
If you self-host with the same provider, enterprise support costs at least $15,000 
per month: It comes with these benefits: immediate access to a senior cloud engineer 
around the clock, a specialized Solutions Architect, a Technical Account Manager, 
and account management staff dedicated to the billion-dollar portfolio (only Vista 
companies).
Jamf Account regional teams: You are represented by a global account team at Jamf. 
To make sure your needs are being met, they communicate with Jamf Cloud developers 
directly. Jamf Account regional teams are located in Minneapolis (MN), Eau Claire (WI), 
Austin (TX), Cupertino (CA), New York (NY), Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Katowice 
(Poland), Sydney (Australia), Emmen (The Netherlands), Causeway Bay (Hong Kong), 
London (United Kingdom), Munich (Germany), Stockholm (Sweden), and Tokyo 
(Japan).
Platform: The software versions that Jamf Pro supports are decided by direct 
collaboration between Jamf Cloud and the software engineering teams. This includes 
the technologies that Jamf Pro currently supports, such as cloud-optimized settings 
for Jamf Cloud. Beyond the usual fundamental prerequisites like Java, MySQL, and 
Tomcat, this goes farther. It includes promoting and standardizing technologies like 
Amazon Linux, Amazon Aurora, elastic load balancers, and application load balancers. 
Because of this close association, Jamf Cloud clients’ Jamf Pro setups are optimized 
for both the platform and the configuration level. Jamf Cloud adoption promotes best 
practices within an organization. Jamf Pro is becoming increasingly connected with the 
marketplace. Partners are developing for Jamf Cloud workloads, and they anticipate that 
Jamf Cloud integrations will be easier to analyze and deploy. Customers who self-host on 
Amazon Web Services can use of some of Jamf Cloud’s advantages.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

248
Compliance: When hosting Jamf Pro for customers, they hold to high standards. 
This includes a method to maintain the environment, the third parties Jamf pays to 
audit operations, and the assurance of the security of customer Jamf Pro instances. Self-­
hosting Jamf Pro and achieving the same degree of compliance would be a significant 
and costly task.
Security: Jamf’s primary responsibility is information security, and the company 
has vast experience in this field. Jamf can alleviate the customer workload by ensuring 
that the environments have controls in place for areas as of vulnerability administration, 
event security management, monitoring of security configuration, reviewing and 
auditing of security, identity and access management, incident management for 
security, security evaluation, and patch management.
Alerting and monitoring: Customers are contractually guaranteed 99.9% system 
availability under the Jamf Hosting Terms and Conditions. If Jamf ever fails to uphold 
this guarantee, it will offer credits in accordance with the conditions of that agreement. 
Every year, Jamf invests hundreds of thousands of dollars in monitoring to make sure 
it is giving its clients the best service possible. The following areas are covered by this: 
monitoring of application performance, server monitoring, service monitoring, end-­
user monitoring, tools for incident communication, logging for businesses, and custom 
monitoring.

standard security measures for hosting services.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

251
Jamf collaborates effectively with others: The majority of enterprise authentication 
and identity services are fully integrated with Jamf Cloud. Additionally, Jamf Cloud offers 
expert migration assistance.
Computer Enrollment Methods by Jamf Pro
The process of enrolling Mac computers into Jamf Pro is called enrollment. Computer 
inventory data is sent to Jamf Pro when the computers are enrolled. Enrolling computers 
enables Jamf Pro to manage them. This enables you to execute inventory, remote 
management, and configuration operations on the PCs. When you enroll computers, 
you can provide a local administrator account called the “management account” that 
will be used to manage them. The management account can be used to accomplish the 
following computer tasks: screen sharing; using a Jamf policy to activate File Vault (when 
a secure token is enabled on the management account); using a policy to add or remove 
users from File Vault (when a secure token is enabled on the administration account); 
use a policy to generate a personal recovery key (when a secure token is enabled on the 
management account); and using a policy to perform authenticated restarts (when a 
secure token is enabled on the administration account).
There are two forms of computer enrollment, each with its own set of methods for 
enrolling a computer in that type.
Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) method: Organizations can configure and 
manage devices via automated device enrollment (often referred to as zero-touch 
deployment) as soon as the devices are taken out of the box. These devices now fall 
under supervision, and it is possible to set the MDM profile so that it cannot be removed 
by the user. Devices owned by the company are intended for Automated Device 
Enrollment.
Pre-stage registration is the only way to enroll devices with Automated Device 
registration and Jamf Pro. To cut down on the time and effort required to enroll 
computers with Jamf Pro, you can utilize a pre-stage enrollment to customize the 
computer enrollment process, distribute configuration profiles and packages during 
enrolment, and store setup settings. Computers running macOS 10.10 or later can 
also be handled automatically via a pre-stage enrollment. User-initiated enrollment 
for macOS must be enabled in Jamf Pro before using a pre-stage enrolment. Using this 
technique, you can become a User Approved MDM. Please take note that this method of 
enrollment needs an Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager account.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

252
Apple Business Manager: With Apple Business Manager, you can deploy Mac, iPad, 
iPhone, and Apple TV devices automatically to users, complete with settings, security 
controls, apps, and books. Automated Device Enrollment, formerly known as Apple 
Device Enrollment Program (Apple DEP), and Volume Purchasing, formerly known as 
Apple Volume Purchase Program (Apple VPP), are combined into one powerful service. 
Jamf Pro and Jamf now completely integrate with Apple Business Manager and offer 
same-day support for new features, allowing you to take advantage of device enrollment, 
security, volume purchasing, and roles.
Apple School Manager: Jamf Pro and Jamf School both interface with Apple School 
Manager to help schools automate and streamline device deployments. This integration 
significantly improves education workflows by providing IT with a single point of 
contact for all deployment and ongoing management requirements. This improves 
Apple deployment and continuing administration operations for you like creating 
the ideal learning environment for kids and teachers to thrive in with Apple School 
Manager, volume purchasing, managed Apple IDs, device setup, shared iPads, classroom 
management, and Student Information System (SIS) Integration.
The Device Enrollment method for computers: Device Enrollment enables 
organizations to manually enroll devices and regulate various elements of device use, 
including the option to wipe the device. When a user deletes an MDM profile, all settings 
and apps managed by the MDM solution are also deleted. There are several methods 
you can use to enroll computers with Device Enrollment and Jamf Pro which are user-­
initiated enrollment for computers, making use of a Recon Quick Add package, using the 
Recon Network Scanner to enroll multiple computers, remotely enrolling a computer 
with Recon, and running Recon locally to enroll a computer. However, the following is 
the recommended one: the User-Initiated Enrollment settings allow you to personalize 
the enrollment process for users down to the messaging that appears at each stage. By 
logging onto a web-based enrollment portal and following the onscreen instructions, 
users can enroll their own machines. Depending on the macOS version of the computer, 
customers are prompted to download either an MDM profile or a Quick Add package 
during registration. One approach for obtaining a User Approved MDM status is using 
the MDM profile mechanism.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

253
Important Components of Jamf Pro
Jamf Policies: You can remotely automate routine administration tasks on managed 
computers using policies. You may distribute software, run scripts, and manage accounts 
using a policy. When you develop a policy, you describe the actions you want to 
automate, the frequency at which they should be performed (execution frequency), the 
occasion at which they should be carried out (trigger), and the users and computers for 
which they should be applied (scope). Users can access policies in Self Service and run 
them on their computers as necessary.
Frequency of policy execution: It consists of once per computer, once per user 
per computer, once per user, once every day, once every week, once every month, and 
ongoing.
Policy triggers: It consists of startup, login, logout, network state change, enrollment 
complete, recurring check-in, and custom. Computer Configuration Profiles are XML 
files called configuration profiles (.mobileconfig) and they offer a simple way to specify 
settings and limitations for users, computers, and devices.
Payload options for profile configurations: Payload variables can be used to 
add attribute values from Jamf Pro to configuration profile settings. As a result, you 
may produce payloads that include details on each device and user to whom you are 
disseminating the profile. When establishing a configuration profile in Jamf Pro, enter 
the $VARIABLE into any text field to use a payload variable. The value of the appropriate 
attribute in Jamf Pro is substituted for the $VARIABLE during profile installation.
Self Service: Self Service from Jamf offers a well-managed app catalogue, a potent 
tool for controlling and securing external applications. Additionally, it is a means to 
provide employees the authority and tools they require to be productive immediately. 
Self Service is an excellent tool for reducing end user wait times and for freeing up IT 
staff members from installing apps so they can work on other projects.
macOS application packaging: A self-contained collection of files known as 
a package can be distributed to distant computers. To create packages of software, 
applications, preference files, or documents, use Composer or a third-party packaging 
tool. To manage the packages you want to distribute to the computers in your 
environment, you can utilize Jamf Pro and Jamf Admin. Adding a package to your 
distribution point and Jamf Pro as well as modifying the package’s settings are all part 
of managing packages. You can use a policy in Jamf Pro to distribute a package to 
computers after it has been added to the distribution point and Jamf Pro.

Security Compliance and its Frameworks
It’s crucial to create a strong plan as more businesses introduce Apple devices into the 
office to make sure you can retain compliance with IT policies and adhere to industry 
security standards and regulations. Compliance with security legislation, industry 
standards, and data and security obligations is important. The device and data use cases, 
legal requirements, and industry in which an organization operates all have a significant 
impact on its compliance management strategy.
In the context of data security, it’s crucial for organizations to comprehend that if 
compliance requirements aren’t completed, you run the danger of decline in reputation; 
loss of clients, accounts, or employment; financial loss in the forms of fines or sanctions; 
and data leaks and breaches.
Advantages of compliance: Following security compliance in an organization has 
various advantages in addition to financial penalties and sanctions, such as keeping 
a competitive edge, increased operational effectiveness, increasing consumer trust, 
reducing security threats, and preserving the reputation of your business.
Compliance frameworks: Organizations frequently employ one of three compliance 
frameworks to make sure they adhere to security and legal requirements. The 
comprehensive guide on managing cybersecurity risk from the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) focuses on five basic operations: identify, protect, 
detect, respond, and recover. It highlights the significance of risk management and 
assessment, as well as ongoing evaluation and improvement. Benchmarks from the CIS 
(Center for Internet Security) are recommendations for securing networks and systems 
in organizations. They concentrate on doable, realistic actions that businesses can take 
to reduce prevalent online dangers. A standard for information security management 
systems (ISMS) is ISO 27001, according to the ISO (International Organization for 
Standardization). It includes a broad variety of security controls, such as access control, 
physical security, and incident management.
The implementation of a security benchmark is also needed for many regulated 
businesses, including systems covered by PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard), which may be used by retail or online businesses that process 
credit card transactions. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) regulations must be followed by healthcare organizations. Under the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), schools and colleges are required to 
implement safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of student education records.

purpose of inventory, look up and populate user data from an LDAP directory service; add 
LDAP directory service user accounts or groups to Jamf Pro; and require users to utilize 
their LDAP directory accounts to access Self Service or the enrollment portal. The scope of 
remote administration tasks should be based on users or groups from the directory service.
Cloud identity providers: You may easily and securely access user information kept 
in the provider’s configuration by integrating Jamf Pro with a cloud identity provider. 
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

257
You may carry out the following: search for and fill up user data for inventory needs and 
add users or groups from the cloud identity provider to Jamf Pro. Users must use their 
directory accounts to access Self Service or the enrollment portal. Users or groups from 
the cloud identity provider inform the scope of remote management tasks.
Single sign-on: For some features of Jamf Pro, single sign-on can be enabled by 
integrating with a third-party identity provider (IdP). Users are automatically forwarded 
to your company’s IdP login page after SSO has been configured and enabled. User 
access to the resource they were attempting to access is granted upon authentication
SMTP server: As a result of integrating with an SMTP server, you can inform Jamf 
Pro users by email when specific events take place. Email invites for user-initiated 
enrollment are sent.

Push certificates: An encrypted file called a push certificate, created by Apple, 
creates a trust relationship between a third-party service like Jamf Pro and the Apple 
Push Notification service (APNs). Jamf Pro commands and data are transmitted to and 
from devices using APNs as the communication channel. After receiving commands, 
devices continuously monitor APNs for messages to send back to Jamf Pro over APNs.
GSX connection: You may combine Jamf Pro with Apple’s Global Service Exchange (GSX) 
using the GSX Connection settings to look up and populate the following purchase data 
for computers and mobile devices: purchase date and warranty expiration date.
MDM profile settings: You can set the MDM profile settings to control when 
computers and mobile devices will automatically renew their MDM profiles. The device 
identity certificate, which is contained in the MDM profile, is likewise renewed for a 
period of two years when the MDM profile is renewed.
PKI certificates: The PKI Certificates settings give you the ability to control the 
public key infrastructure required to create communication between computers, mobile 
devices, and certificate authority (CA). A PKI with certificate-based authentication 
functionality is necessary for Jamf Pro.
Volume purchasing: In order to control the distribution of your apps and books 
to devices or users, Jamf Pro’s volume purchase connection syncs with Apple School 
Manager or Apple Business Manager.
User-initiated enrollment: Jamf Pro enrolls computers and mobile devices through 
the enrollment procedure. By doing this, a link is made between the Jamf Pro server and 
the computers and mobile devices. By going to an enrollment URL on their own, people 
can start the enrolling process via user-initiated enrollment. Go to https://JAMF_
PRO_URL.jamfcloud.com/enroll (hosted by Jamf Cloud) and https://JAMF_PRO_URL.
com:8443/enrol (on-premises hosting). These are customised URLs wherein 
“JAMF_PRO_URL” refers to the hostname or company name. These URLs are setup by 
the Jamf team and is unique to every organisation.
Automated device enrollment: When a user turns on a device, Apple’s Automated 
Device Enrollment, commonly referred to as zero-touch deployment, immediately enrolls 
and configures it. IT does not communicate with users. The following device statuses are 
established using this enrollment technique, which is the one that is most frequently used 
for devices owned by your company: Supervised and User-­Approved MDM.
Apple Education Support: You can perform the following with Jamf Pro’s Apple 
Education Support settings: enable the usage of the Apple Classroom app with the 
Shared iPad by allowing computers and iPads to be added to Classes in Jamf Pro.
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

260
Reenrollment: When a computer or mobile device is reenrolled with Jamf Pro, you 
can clear specific inventory data from it using the Reenrollment options in Jamf Pro.
Webhooks: For any event in the Events API, you can create outbound webhooks 
using Jamf Pro’s Webhooks option. Webhooks operate in conjunction with the Events 
API to let you create custom processes whenever you want in the programming language 
of your choice utilizing real-time events from Jamf Pro. For instance, you can set up a 
webhook to alert a chatroom whenever a third-party macOS app in Jamf Pro has been 
updated. The event is sent to the chatroom’s instant message plug-in that you wrote.
AirPlay permissions: You can map one or more mobile devices to an AirPlay 
destination, like an Apple TV, using AirPlay Permissions, enabling those mapped mobile 
devices to automatically pair with the AirPlay destination. You can decide whether to 
automatically provide the mobile device the password for the AirPlay destination when it 
is mapped to one using AirPlay Permissions, or to restrict that device’s access to only the 
authorized AirPlay destinations.
Conditional Access: Due to the transition away from Microsoft’s Partner Device 
Management legacy API, Jamf will stop providing Conditional Access support in a later 
version of Jamf Pro (expected removal date: mid-2024). As an alternative, Jamf now 
provides macOS Device Compliance, which makes use of Microsoft’s brand-new Partner 
Compliance Management API. The transition from the old Partner Device Management 
API to the new Partner Compliance Management API is being developed jointly by Jamf 
and Microsoft. The legacy Partner Device Management API will continue to function 
for a year after the migration path is made available to give organizations using the 
historical API time to switch to the new API. To ensure the easiest transition to the 
new macOS Device Compliance (Partner Compliance Management API), Jamf advises 
environments using the macOS Conditional Access (Partner Device Management 
API) to wait until the migration path is made available. Before the Microsoft Partner 
Device Management API is deprecated in the future, Jamf users will need to migrate 
their workflows to macOS Device Compliance in Jamf Cloud. Customers who presently 
use macOS Conditional Access will need to switch their workflows over to Jamf cloud’s 
macOS device compliance. Contact Customer Success for more information about Jamf 
Cloud support. Only AWS GovCloud is supported for the creation of new Conditional 
Access integrations
Chapter 5  Introduction to Jamf and Apple Enterprise Management

261
Device compliance: You may enforce compliance on Jamf Pro-managed 
institutionally owned macOS, iOS, and iPadOS devices by integrating with Microsoft 
Intune. This enables businesses to guarantee that only authorized users using authorized 
devices have access to company resources. The Partner Compliance Management API is 
used for the Jamf Pro device compliance interface with Microsoft Intune.
BeyondCorp Enterprise Integration: Organizations may make sure that only 
dependable individuals with authorized computers and mobile devices can access 
organizational resources with Google BeyondCorp Enterprise. Administrators can 
create a compliance and security framework around end user devices without needing a 
network perimeter thanks to the BeyondCorp Enterprise interface between Jamf Pro and 
BeyondCorp.
Inventory preload: Before devices are enrolled, you can upload computers and 
mobile device inventory data using the Inventory Preload configuration. When inventory 
is gathered based on a matching serial number, the preloaded information will be 
applied to computers and mobile devices. When a comma-separated value (CSV) file is 
submitted, user data is immediately used.
Enrollment customization: The Automated Device Enrollment user experience can 
be tailored using the Enrollment Customization options in Jamf Pro.
Cloud services connection: By turning on the Cloud Services Connection, you may 
immediately link your Jamf Pro instance to any Jamf-hosted services that are accessible. 
The following services are offered: icon service, app installers, Jamf platform integration 
service, and Title Editor.
Remote administration: It contains TeamViewer Integration. You can create a 
remote screen-sharing connection between a Jamf Pro administrator and an end user’s 
computer by integrating Jamf Pro with TeamViewer, an all-in-one remote access tool that 
is quick and safe.

CHAPTER 6
Automation
This chapter covers automation in macOS and how it can be useful for Mac system 
administrators, system engineers, DevOps engineers, and others. Automation makes the 
life of a system admin much easier and provides the best experience for the end user. To 
understand and apply automation on a macOS computer in real time, you need a clear 
understanding of the following topics in detail:
•	
The command-line interface (Terminal) and its usage
•	
Mac Terminal vs. the Windows command-line interface (CLI)
•	
Day-to-day/useful commands from the CLI (i.e., Terminal)
•	
Supported programming languages on macOS
•	
AppleScript and a slight introduction
•	
Basics of shell scripting and important components
•	
How to create and execute a shell script using Terminal or a third-­
party text editor
•	
Known third-party text editors for Macs
•	
Advanced shell scripting
•	
Use of the command line on macOS
Using the Command Line on macOS
In an earlier chapter, you explored the command-line interface (i.e., Terminal) basics, so 
now you’ll learn how Terminal can be useful with macOS. The command line is a great 
way to relate to macOS without the use of a graphical user interface (GUI). Although 
most basic administrative tasks can be achieved using the GUI on macOS, in some cases 

274
it is more sensible to perform them via Terminal. Terminal is built on the Unix operating 
system. Let’s understand why and when it’s required to use custom command-line 
commands in macOS along with useful commands.
Prerequisites to Using the CLI on macOS
You must know the fundamentals of the macOS ecosystem and be using a Mac device 
with administrator privileges.
Reasons to Use the Command-Line Interface
You can use the command line for administrative tasks instead of relying on the normal 
user interface, such as when you want to execute change permissions system-wide, 
batch commands, automate operational tasks, or diagnose issues. It comes with these 
benefits: you can access filesystem, remotely manage a Mac device over Apple Remote 
Desktop, remotely manage devices using MDM, automate recurring tasks using 
scripting, execute remote login using SSH, and execute commands as a root user.
Construction of a Command-Line Sequence
The command prompt is the beginning line where every macOS Unix command is input 
and executed. It delivers vital details to the user. It includes the current user, current 
directory, and machine name in the command prompt.
6-1
Chapter 6  Automation

275Figure 6-1﻿.﻿
Figure 6-1.  Overview of a Mac Terminal command-line sequence
Differences Between Mac Terminal and Windows 
Command Line
There are three major operating systems available: macOS, Linux, and Windows. macOS 
Terminal uses Unix commands and the Windows CLI is built on the MS DOS structure of 
commands.
Every OS comes with a selection for the shell. The macOS CLI is called Terminal and 
it customs the results of sh. Until 10.15 (i.e., Catalina OS) macOS came with the default 
of bash, but from 10.15 and onwards, macOS comes with the default of zsh. The syntax of 
sh programs are same. Overall, the purpose is to resolve the same issues.
Basically, bash is just sh but with additional types and better syntax. macOS uses 
bash. Windows uses PowerShell and cmd. Both come with a unique syntax. By default, 
PowerShell is installed on Windows 7 and further Windows versions.
To use the Unix command prompt on macOS, open the Terminal app, which is 
located by default in the Utilities folder. The Utilities folder exists inside the Applications 
Chapter 6  Automation

276
folder (/Applications/Utilities). To use the cmd prompt in Windows 7, click the Start 
button and type cmd in search box. In later Windows versions, you can navigate to the 
Start menu, find Run, and input a cmd command.
The Power of the sudo Command
This is one of the most powerful and vital commands. The sudo command (or superuser 
do) permits you to execute commands as a root user. It is a transient approach to allow 
a user an administrative right. You will customize it when you need to accomplish 
administration activities. This will imitate the system or different users, which only 
superuser can perform, for modifying configuration files, installing software libraries, 
and more. To use the sudo command, you must be an admin at least.
For instance, if you are not an administrator or a root user, entering the sleep 2 
command gives you an error:
Command used in Terminal: sudo sleep 2
6-2Figure 6-2﻿.﻿
Figure 6-2.  Demonstration of the sudo command with a standard user
Chapter 6  Automation

277
The reason for this error is that the sleep 2 command can only be executed by the 
root user or by an administrator with superuser do privileges.

Command used in Terminal: sudo sleep 2

Supported Programming Languages on macOS
macOS can execute any program compiled for Intel or M1 Mac models. Overall, you can 
run AppleScript, C, Objective-C, C++, Ruby, Python, PHP, shell scripting, x86 or ARM 
assembler, and many other languages. However, shell scripting is most used on macOS.
AppleScript Definition and Overview
Similar to bash, AppleScript is also a scripting language made by Apple. It permits users 
to directly control scriptable Mac applications, including macOS itself. It is used to 
automate the activities of the Mac OS along with several applications. AppleScript comes 
with certain processing capabilities of its own, along with the transfer and delivery of 
Apple events to an app. At the same time, it can also perform simple computations 
and text administering. Primarily, though, AppleScript trusts the features of the app 
and processes to handle composite assignments. Because it is an organized command 
language, AppleScript can be associated with a Unix shell and Microsoft Windows Script 
Host, but it is separate from all of them. The syntax of AppleScript built on the English 
syntax, so if someone has no coding knowledge, they can still understand it just by 
reading it.
Syntax and how to write a simple script in AppleScript: To create and execute 
simple AppleScript, you must have the Script Editor application, which is an inbuilt app 
on macOS. It can be open from the Utilities\Application folder or from Spotlight to open 
Script Editor.
Example 1: To display a prompt on a user Mac computer with two buttons, here is 
the code:
display dialog "Know more about AppleScript." buttons {"Read", "Skip"}

to automate tasks on macOS.
Chapter 6  Automation

306
Shell Scripting and Its Usage
A shell script is a computer program intended to run in a shell. Scripts can be written 
in many scripting languages. Distinctive functions are file manipulation, program 
executing, and printing text. Shell scripts are robust in deploying data. Shell scripts 
provide a seamless solution to do so. They are also easy to develop and easy to run on 
macOS. They can be easily used to filter ranges and data alteration on an enormous 
scale. Because of that reason, shell scripts are frequently used in data science and other 
specialized environments. Each shell has a precise feature set, therefore bash features 
may not occur in different shells. To confirm a bash script is construed the correct way, 
it must begin with #!/bin/bash. In order for bash to operate, the bash shell needs be 
installed on the present operating system.
Differences Between bash vs. zsh
bash and zsh (i.e., part of Bourne shell family) share central features. Zsh stands for 
Z shell, which is the supplement of Bash along with numerous features. But there are 
differences. Auto completion is much quicker in zsh as compared to bash. zsh comes 
with inline wildcard expansion; bash doesn’t support this feature. zsh comes with 
prefix and suffix command aliases; bash doesn’t support these features. Zsh comes with 
numerous themes and plugins; bash offers less themes and plugins. By default, zsh 
doesn’t handle # as a comment; # is a comment in bash by default. Zsh is more accurate 
and in case of an issue it throws an error; bash does items on its own. zsh holds the user 
configuration settings in .zshrc; bash holds the user configuration settings in .bashrc. zsh 
comes with numerous superior features compared to bash.
Modifying the Default Shell on macOS

Basic Building Components for Writing a Simple 
Bash Script
What are variables? Variables are used to store data. You can customize variables to 
read, manipulate, and access data during the script. The macOS and Linux operating 
systems have variables by default. You can use env to display a list of environment 
variables. To write an effective shell script, it’s always good to use variables.
In bash, a variable can store numeric values, characters, or strings of characters.
Syntax: Key=Value (This the way variable can be defined.)
6-39
Chapter 6  Automation

313
Commands used in Terminal:
key=value
echo $key
echo ${key}
echo ${key}1
echo $key1
The organization of variables doesn’t make any impact on the shell. In a similar way, 
variables hold strings, real numbers, and integers. It’s important to understand that a 
variable can store one value at a time. Subsequently, string split using spaces are require 
to have quotes. For example, the following variable holds the string Execute, but because 
of the space after Execute, it will not store Task.
Var=Execute TaskFigure 6-39.﻿﻿
Figure 6-39.  Demonstration of a variable
Chapter 6  Automation

314
Thus, the correct assignment for a variable is the following:
Var="Execute Task"
You can allocate the value centered on the output attained from the above command 
by means of command substitution. Note that $ is essential to access the current 
variable’s value.
SubVar=$Var (This will allocate the value of Var the new variable SubVar)
6-40
Commands Used in Terminal:
Var="Execute Task"
echo $Var
SubVar=$Var
echo SubVar=$VarFigure 6-40.﻿﻿
Figure 6-40.  Understanding variables with examples
Chapter 6  Automation

315
There are mainly three types of variables:
Global variables comes with a global scope and are easily available during the 
program. The main benefit of global variables are that they can be declared externally in 
the chunk of code or the function.
Local variables are only available within a particular function or chunk of code. 
Local variables can supersede an identical variable name in the bigger scope.
6-41
Commands used in Terminal:
set / env / printenv
printenvFigure 6-41.﻿﻿
Figure 6-41.  Demonstration of the set/ env /printenv command
Chapter 6  Automation

316
Naming conventions for variables: The following are the variable naming 
conventions in bash scripting: letters, underscores (_), and numbers. A variable must 
begin with a letter or underscore (_). No spaces or special characters are allowed. 
They are case-sensitive and custom descriptive names that suggest the purpose of the 
variable. Reserved keywords are if, then, else, fi, and etc.
Var, sum, Var, Do_Var, and DoVar are some valid variable names in bash scripting. 
Here are some invalid names: 3rdVar (a variable name can’t begin with a number), Do 
Var (a variable name can’t have a space), and Do-Var (a variable name can’t include a 
hyphen).
What are arguments and their uses? A command-line argument is a value that can 
be passed to the shell script as it executes. Additionally, it permits the user to modify 
events the script executes. To authorize an argument with the shell script, it’s required to 
input in the arguments just after the script name, during the execution of script.
Syntax shellextension ./NameoftheScript.extenstion argument1 argument2.
For instance, sh ./testscript.sh do work (wherein sh=shellextension, 
testscript.sh=NameoftheScript.extenstion, do=argument1, work=argument2)
What are conditionals and their use? Conditional statements are mostly used in 
scripting to achieve decision-making jobs. They basically allow you to modify the drift of 
control in a script. Conditional statements come with five unique statements that can be 
used in shell scripting when required.
Expressions generate a Boolean output, either true or false, and are known to be 
conditions. There are various ways to assess conditions, including if, if-else, if-elif-else, 
and nested conditionals.
Let’s understand the syntax for all five conditional statements one by one:
Syntax of the if conditional:
if [ condition ]
then
    statement
fi
Syntax of the if-else conditional:
if [ condition ]
then
    statement1
else
    statement2
Chapter 6  Automation

317
fi
Syntax of the else-if ladder conditional:
if [ condition1 ]
then
    statement1
elif [ condition2 ]
then
    statement2
else
    statement3
fi
Syntax of the nested if conditional:
if [ condition1 ]
then
    statement1
else
    if [ condition2 ]
    then
    statement2
    fi
fi
Syntax of the switch conditional:
case in
    case2) Statement 1;
    case 2) Statement 2;
esac
Logical operators such as AND -a and OR -o are powerful for comparisons that have 
more impact. If [ $x -gt 50 -x $y -lt 90 ], this statement will validate if both conditions are 
true: x is greater than 50 AND y is less than 90, wherein gt stands for greater than and lt 
stands for less than.
Numeric comparison operators: Here are a few operations:
5 -eq 5 means 5=5
5 -ne 2 means 5 is not equal to 2
Chapter 6  Automation

318
5 -gt 1 means 5 is greater than 1
5 -lt 6 means 5 is less than 6
5 -ge 5 means 5 is >=5
5 -le 5 means 5 <=5
What are wild cards? A wildcard is basically a concise written outline, frequently a 
specific character, that can match other character in a file path. Additionally, it is a form 
of shortcut that permits you to state a complete set of connected path names by means of 
a brief outline. Using the wildcard form, it is quite simple to copy, delete, or move a huge 
number of files by a specific command. In all, there are three types of wildcards which 
are described below.

What is piping and its use? It allows you to use the outcome of a script/command 
by way of the input of the other. Piping is an enormously influential and adaptable 
quality of bash and is frequently used with the native commands offered by bash.
Syntax for the pipe command: command1 | command2 .... | commandZ
Consider this example:

Chapter 6  Automation

322
The while loop and its syntax: It is a declaration that iterates over a chunk of code 
until the condition indicated is assessed as false. You can customize this statement or 
loop in the shell script after the condition is successful to assess to true before assessing 
as false.
Syntax for a while loop:
while [ condition ];
do
# Set of statements
# Set of commands
done
If the condition evaluates to be true, then the commands inside the while block are 
performed and are repeated after testing the condition. If the condition evaluates to 
be false, the statements inside the while block are skipped and the statements after the 
while block are performed.
The for loop and its syntax: A for loop is somewhat like a while loop, in that it 
permits you to execute statements a certain number of times. Each loop varies in its 
syntax and custom.
Syntax of a for loop:
for <variable> in <Value1 Value2 ... valueN>
do
<command 1>
<command 2>
........................
< so, on>
done
The until loop and its syntax: It is performed as many as times the condition/
command assesses to be false. The loop terminates when the condition/command 
develops to be true.
Syntax for an until loop:
until <condition>
do
<command 1>
<command 2>

Creating and Executing a Shell Script on macOS
Before creating and executing the script, you must first understand the very first line in 
bash script (#!/bin/bash) and its body components. Following are the components:
Explanation of (#!/bin/bash): This is the beginning and very first line of bash 
scripts. You say this line aloud as she-bang‘(shabang), hashbang. Fundamentally, this 
originates from the concatenation of two tokens, sharp(#) and bang (!). This grouping 
of tokens is present at the start of a script. It will state which interpreter must be used to 
perform the commands.
#!/bin/bash is located in the /bin directory, while the default shell to execute the 
commands available in file. It also describes about absolute path as /usr/bin/bash 
to bash shell and is typically the default location of bash shell in every Unix-based 
operating system/macOS/Linux.
Procedure of /bin/bash: This is the best common shell used by system admins 
or developers. It is the default shell for user login in the Mac/Unix systems. bash can 
perform most scripts. Most system admins and developers use it because it has extra 
features and an improved syntax.
6-47
Command used in Terminal: which bash
Chapter 6  Automation

324Figure 6-47.﻿﻿
Figure 6-47.  Use of which bash
Usage of bash: Several of the common use cases for bash are system administrators 
who customize systems systematically and reproducibly, software developers who 
automate tasks such as code compilation and debugging source code, and network 
engineers who must test, configure, and enhance network performance.
How to comment in bash: Comments are basically used to explain what the script is 
doing. To use a comment, put # and the comment. Comments are also used if you don’t 
want to execute line in the script.
For example: # This is a comment.
Multiline comments in bash: Unlike other scripting or programming languages, 
bash doesn’t support multiline comments. To use multiline comments in bash scripting, 
just add the separate comments next to it.
For example: # First line of first comment and # Second line of second 
comment.
Chapter 6  Automation

325
Let’s understand with the help of an instance. A script is basically just a set of various 
instructions. In the following instance, the very first line starts with a # (called a hash) 
followed with the ! (called an exclamation mark). It instructs the operating system 
to utilize bash by way of a default shell to execute the script. So echo "Learn Shell 
Scripting" will print the Learn Shell Scripting as the outcome to the console.
// By means of shebang to state the Operating System to
// custom bash shell
// test.sh—This is the Filename with sh extension.
echo- means to display and print the outcome
#!/bin/bash
# Bash script
echo "Learn Shell Scripting"
Option 1: These steps need to be followed in the same order to create and execute 
the shell script on Terminal using TextEdit.
Note  With the help of TextEdit, you can open and edit rich text documents 
built in other word processing apps, including Microsoft Word and OpenOffice. 
Documents can also be saved in a different format so they’re compatible with 
other applications.
Launch the terminal and use cd to locate the directory where the script needs to be 
created. See Figure 4-48.

Some of the known best text editors for Macs are CodeRunner, Visual Studio Code, Atom, 
Sublime Text, BBEdit, Vim, Brackets, and IntelliJ IDEA.
Advance Shell Scripting and Its Components
Functions: Functions provide the easiest way to reuse code. To avoid copying and 
pasting the similar block of code more than twice, consider placing it inside a function. 
These are effectively mini scripts within a script.
Syntax of a function in zsh/bash: The following is the format of a function in 
bash/zsh:
<function name> () {
<command1>
<command2>
.....................
<command_N>
}
function name # for calling
6-56
Chapter 6  Automation

334Figure 6-56.﻿﻿
Figure 6-56.  Executing a shell script with a function in CodeRunner
Building Elements That Create a Function
The name of the function (in this case myfunction) is shown first. It is followed by 
two round brackets. They are followed by two curly brackets with the commands to 
be executed between them. Lastly, the function is named (a.k.a. run or executed) by 
simply writing the function’s name. Note that a function’s call can only be done after its 
definition. So if you had called myfunction before you described what it does with the 
brackets, it would not have functioned.
How to pass arguments to a function: The actual control of functions is that they 
can be used to process data. To perform this, they primary need to be set some data and, 
secondly, they need to be able to perform something with it.
Giving certain data to a function is accomplished by passing arguments to it. This 
is completed when the function is named, by writing the data in question after the 
function’s name. For instance, if you run myfunction Learn Functions the words Learn 
and Functions will be delivered to the function called myfunction.

Note  bash/zsh uses zero indexing, therefore the first element is in position zero 
and the number 8 is actually at index 2, not 3! Also it’s required to include the 
curly brackets when making this call; if they are left out, bash/zsh will search for a 
variable called numbers[4] instead of a variable called numbers.

Best Way to Debug and Troubleshoot Bash Scripts
Debugging and troubleshooting are vital abilities for any bash scripter. Although bash 
scripts can be extremely powerful, they can also be prone to faults and unforeseen 
behavior. In this section, you’ll learn useful tips and techniques for debugging and 
troubleshooting bash scripts.
Align the set -x option: This technique is good to debug the bash script. It’s basically 
using the set -x flag in the beginning of script. This preference enables debugging 
mode, which has bash print each command that it performs to the terminal, preceded 
by a + sign. This can be extremely helpful in recognizing where errors are occurring in 
the script.
Chapter 6  Automation

341
Here is the syntax:
#!/bin/bash
set -x
# Here is the script need to come
Leverage echo statements: Another valuable method for debugging bash scripts is 
to insert echo statements throughout the code. This can aid to identify where errors are 
occurring and what values are being passed to variables.
Here is the syntax:
#!/bin/bash
# Here is the script need to come
echo "Value of variable x is: $x"

Summary
You should now understand the benefit of automation with bash scripting in 
macOS. Additionally, you should be very well versed with the command-line utility 
called Terminal in macOS. You should also have good understanding about useful 
commands used in Terminal, which will eventually be helpful in your daily job and in 
automating repetitive tasks. You also know how to validate commands being executed in 
Terminal. Now you understand why bash/shell scripting is frequently used compared to 
other programming languages in macOS. You also learned how to create a simple shell 
script and advance shell scripting to automate tasks in your macOS environment.
This is the last chapter. You are completely equipped to manage the macOS 
environment in your company using the Jamf Pro mobile device management solution.
