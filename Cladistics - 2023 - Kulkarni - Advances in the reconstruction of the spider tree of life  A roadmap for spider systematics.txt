Abstract
In the last decade and a half, advances in genetic sequencing technologies have revolutionized systematics, transforming the
ﬁeld from studying morphological characters or a few genetic markers, to genomic datasets in the phylogenomic era. A plethora
of molecular phylogenetic studies on many taxonomic groups have come about, converging on, or refuting prevailing morphol-
ogy or legacy-marker-based hypotheses about evolutionary afﬁnities. Spider systematics has been no exception to this transfor-
mation and the inter-relationships of several groups have now been studied using genomic data. About 51 500 extant spider
species have been described, all with a conservative body plan, but innumerable morphological and behavioural peculiarities.
Inferring the spider tree of life using morphological data has been a challenging task. Molecular data have corroborated many
hypotheses of higher-level relationships, but also resulted in new groups that refute previous hypotheses. In this review, we dis-
cuss recent advances in the reconstruction of the spider tree of life and highlight areas where additional effort is needed with
potential solutions. We base this review on the most comprehensive spider phylogeny to date, representing 131 of the 132 spider
families. To achieve this sampling, we combined six Sanger-based markers with newly generated and publicly available genome-
scale datasets. We ﬁnd that some inferred relationships between major lineages of spiders (such as Austrochiloidea, Palpimanoi-
dea and Synspermiata) are robust across different classes of data. However, several new hypotheses have emerged with different
classes of molecular data. We identify and discuss the robust and controversial hypotheses and compile this blueprint to design
future studies targeting systematic revisions of these problematic groups. We offer an evolutionary framework to explore com-
parative questions such as evolution of venoms, silk, webs, morphological traits and reproductive strategies.

Introduction
In
animal
taxonomy,
spiders
are
a
unique
group among all animals because their binomial nam-
ing by Clerck’s (1757) Svenska Spindlar predates Lin-
naeus’s
(1758)
10th
edition
of
Systema
Naturae.
Linnaeus’s (1758) is established as the starting point of
zoological nomenclature by the International Code of
Zoological
Nomenclature
(ICZN).
Spiders
are
a
remarkably diverse lineage among arthropods. An apt
example of their evolutionary success is that there
are 51 500 described species (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023), but with an estimated two-fold number of
species remaining undiscovered (Platnick, 1999; Agnars-
son et al., 2013). This species richness is greatly asym-
metrical compared to the species richness of its sister
group, Pedipalpi, which contains <700 described species
(Harvey,
2013;
Ballesteros
et
al.,
2021;
Miranda
et al., 2021, 2022). Spiders occupy all terrestrial and
some aquatic habitats, and are distributed on all conti-
nents except Antarctica. The origin of spiders is esti-
mated to be c. 400 Ma (Magalhaes et al., 2020; Kallal
et al., 2021a), after which they have evolved a great
diversity of shapes, sizes, behaviours, silk uses, web

architectures, respiratory systems and venom compounds
(Platnick, 2020).
Morphological and biological makeup
The synapomorphies of spiders include the produc-
tion of silk from the associated spinning apparatus
and the presence of venom glands opening through the
cheliceral fang (Fig. 1). Spigots (and their silk) origi-
nated before the evolution of spinnerets (Shultz, 1987),
a claim that is supported by the presence of spinneret-
less
spigots
in
the
order
Uraraneida
(Selden
et al., 2008). However, the hypothesis that spinnerets
are exclusive to Araneae was challenged by the discov-
ery of Chimerarachne yingi Wang et al. (2018) (popu-
larly known as “the spider with a tail”) from Burmese
amber (dated 99 Ma). This fossil bears spinnerets,
male pedipalps presumably modiﬁed for sperm transfer
(both characters being synapomorphies of spiders) and
a uropygid-like telson, and is placed as a sister group
to all spiders (Wang et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018).
In extant spiders, silk is used for many tasks critical to
spider biology and survival, such as constructing for-
aging webs (e.g. the characteristic orb web), wrapping
prey, dispersal via ballooning, bonding to substrates
and producing egg sacs (Fig. 3). These myriad utilities
of silks have been attained by the secretions of up to
seven different types of glands that function individu-
ally or in combination (Kovoor, 1972, 1977). Some
web-building spiders bear a short transverse ﬁeld of
spigots (homologous to the primitive anterior median
spinnerets) called the cribellum that is used to secrete
a distinctive type of silk (as in net-casting Deinopidae
webs).
The cribellum is coupled with a row of curved setae
on the metatarsus of the fourth leg called the calamis-
trum, which is used to process and lay the cribellate
silk. Webs are constructed by many lineages to capture
prey, yet many other spiders (some which have second-
arily lost web-building, some which never had this
behaviour) use alternative strategies such as ambush-
ing or active hunting. A peculiar adaptation—adhesive
setae on legs such as scopulae or claw tufts—are found
in most of these wandering spiders (webless) and have
evolved multiple times, although some web-building
spiders also bear adhesive setae (Wolff et al., 2013).
Recently, an encyclopaedic treatment of spider webs
by William Eberhard revealed unparalleled diversity

of webs with intricate behaviours and functions (Eber-
hard, 2020), forming a framework for posing many
new questions about evolutionary transitions.
Spiders are generalist predators with the exception
of a small proportion of specialists with a reduced diet
(such as preying exclusively on terrestrial isopods,
ants, moths, dipterans or even other spiders) (Pekar
and Toft, 2015). In web-building spiders, silk is used
in combination with the chelicerae to inject venom
through fangs, in order to capture and immobilize the
prey, whereas many hunters only rely on their legs,
pedipalps and chelicerae to grasp prey while injecting
venom. A large variety of venom compositions have
evolved
within
spiders,
with
>3000
compounds
recorded so far (Kuhn-Nentwig et al., 2011; L€uddecke
et al., 2022). In general, venomic complexity and
venom gland sizes are larger in generalist spiders com-
pared
to
their
specialist
counterparts
(Pekar
et al., 2018; L€uddecke et al., 2022).
In addition to these synapomorphies, another char-
acteristic feature of spiders includes the occurrence of
two types of respiratory systems—book lungs and tra-
cheae, with most spiders having both of these types. It
is hypothesized that the book lungs are the symplesio-
morphic condition because they are found in the three
orders of Tetrapulmonata and earliest-diverging clades
of spiders, Mesothelae and Mygalomorphae and some
early-diverging Araneomorphae, for example, Gradun-
gulidae and Hypochilidae (<35 of c. 47, 500 species of
araneomorph spiders) (Ramırez, 2000; Schmitz, 2013;
Ramırez et al., 2021). They have two pairs of book
lungs whereas most “modern” spiders (Araenomor-
phae) have either a combination of one pair of book
lungs and tracheae [e.g. water spider Argyroneta aqua-
tica (Clerck, 1757)] or exclusively only tracheae (for
example, Symphytognathidae).
The most common (and vital) acts in spider survival
are thus the result of an integration of many behav-
iours, for example prey capture involves prey detec-
tion,
hunting
behaviours,
venom
composition
amounting to toxicity, silk (such as web or prey cap-
ture) and energy demand (mitigated by respiration), in
addition to other traits such as vision (except for eye-
less
spiders),
and
sensing
movement
and
sound
through vibration. All of these traits are highly diverse
across Araneae and understanding their evolutionary
history is essential to explore the inﬂuential factors on
the evolutionary success of different spider lineages.
To understand the evolutionary history of these char-
acteristics, the prerequisite is a robust phylogenetic
hypothesis.
In the last three decades there have been numerous
phylogenetic studies of spiders using morphological data
but it has been challenging, and in some cases impossible,
to satisfactorily resolve many important nodes of the spi-
der tree of life (e.g. Griswold et al., 2005; Ramırez, 2014).
The sparse genomic resources (before the advent of par-
allel sequencing) have maintained ambiguity in phyloge-
netic relationships of several lineages and many earlier
hypotheses have been refuted with high support by these
more recent genomic studies. For example, Orbiculariae,
which in the past grouped cribellate and ecribellate orb
weavers (e.g. Coddington, 1990) has been shown not to
be a natural group in multiple recent phylogenomic ana-
lyses (Bond et al., 2014; Fernandez et al., 2014, 2018a;
Garrison et al., 2016; Kallal et al., 2021a; Kulkarni
et al., 2020, 2021), corroborating earlier hypotheses of
nonmonophyly based on Sanger-sequencing datasets
(e.g. Blackledge et al., 2009; Dimitrov et al., 2017).
Less
than
a
decade
after
the
Coddington
and
Levi
(1991)
review
of
spider
systematics,
Haus-
dorf (1999) published the ﬁrst molecular phylogeny of
spiders reconstructed using 900 characters (bp) of the
28S rRNA gene. Technological developments, its reach
and cost effectiveness and the number of arachnolo-
gists using nucleotide sequence data have increased
substantially helping to progress our understanding of
spider biology and evolution. The rapid advancement
of massive parallel sequencing technology and its
cost effectiveness for genomic scale data generation
(Christensen et al., 2015) rapidly increased the size of
molecular datasets for spiders (Fig. 2). For example,
some of the most recent phylogenies using genomic
data were reconstructed using anchored hybrid enrich-
ment data which included 33 taxa (19 of 114 families
at the time) (Hamilton et al., 2016), transcriptomes
which included 272 taxa (101 of 128 families at the
time) (Kallal et al., 2021a), ultraconserved elements
(UCEs) which included 248 taxa (88 of 120 families at
the time) (Kulkarni et al., 2021), targeted 99 markers
which included 303 taxa (105 of 132 families at
the time) (Shao et al., 2023) and silkomes which
included 1098 taxa (76 of 132 families at the time)
(Arakawa et al. 2022). Wheeler et al. (2017) published
a
densely
sampled
phylogeny
using
six
genetic
markers acquired via Sanger sequencing, constrained
using the transcriptomes-based phylogeny of Garrison
et al. (2016), which included 932 taxa (115 of 116 fam-
ilies at the time). A few studies have used genome-scale
data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of a spe-
ciﬁc group of spiders, such as Mygalomorphae (Hedin
et al., 2019; Opatova et al., 2020); Leptonetidae (Led-
ford et al., 2021), Synspermiata (Ramırez et al., 2021),
Austrochiloidea (Kulkarni and Hormiga, 2021), Palpi-
manoidea (Wood et al., 2018), Araneoidea (Fernandez
et al., 2018a; Kallal et al., 2020; Kulkarni et al., 2020,
2021) or Salticidae (Maddison et al., 2020). The
hypotheses about relationships among different line-
ages of spiders have been converging to some degree,
yet some recalcitrant nodes remain when reconstructed
using different classes of data (Kulkarni et al., 2021).

problem about recalcitrant nodes and resolution has
been echoed in the literature (Dimitrov and Hor-
miga, 2020, and references therein).
In addition to morphology, Sanger-sequence-based

such
as
ultraconserved
regions within transcriptomes, coding regions within
UCEs, combination of UCEs and transcriptomes and
treating the coding regions as nucleotides and amino
acids (Kulkarni et al., 2021). Most phylogenetic rela-
tionships have largely converged with well-supported
branches, yet some relationships remain elusive. A
prominent and largely explored example of recalcitrant
nodes in the spider tree of life includes the relation-
ships between the families of the superfamily Araneoi-
dea (ecribellate orb weavers and their relatives). Orb-
weaving families, both cribellate (i.e. Deinopidae and
Uloboridae) and ecribellate (e.g. Araneidae, Tetra-
gnathidae
and
some
“symphytognathoids”)
were
deemed to form a monophyletic group (Orbiculariae)
based on morphological and behavioural characters
(e.g., Coddington, 1990). While the monophyly of orb
webs was appealing owing to its simplicity, some
authors had suggested that the cribellate and ecribel-
late orb webs have evolved convergently (reviewed in
Coddington,
1986a).

Wheeler

ships of orb weavers affected hypotheses about the

using a diversity of methods of ancestral reconstruc-
tion hypothesizing multiple origins (e.g. Fernandez
et al., 2018a; Kallal et al., 2021a), whereas other ana-
lyses argued for a single origin (e.g. Coddington

Summing up, instability of phylogenetic relation-

of

Here,
we
review
recent
advancements on interfamilial phylogenetic relation-
ships across the spider tree of life. This study is
designed to identify the recurring conﬂicting nodes
with certain data classes. We discuss these relation-
ships based on the analysis of the hitherto largest sam-
ple
of
spiders
to
date,
using
genome-scale
data
combined with a traditional Sanger-sequence dataset
from the literature, representing 131 of the currently
valid 132 spider families. We review some of the his-
tory and current understanding of family groupings
and their biological characteristics in a phylogenetic
context. We also provide potential future directions
for spider phylogenetics and systematics such as evi-
dence
for
potential
taxonomic
changes
based
on
grouping by monophyly.

The phylogenetic trees were rooted at the node containing the
Xiphosura representatives, Tachypleus tridentatus and Limulus poly-
phemus.

and Ramırez (2019), additional publicly available sequences and
bycatch from UCE assemblies with our UCE dataset to result in
a 1362-taxon dataset belonging to 131 families (99% familial rep-
resentation).

The specimens sequenced for this study come from our own ﬁeld-
work or from the collections of the National Museum of Natural
History (USNM), Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; the
Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University, Bos-
ton, Massachusetts; and the California Academy of Sciences (CAS),
San Francisco, California.
For the specimens we sequenced, three to four legs were used for
DNA extractions from 58 spider specimens using the DNeasy
TM Tis-
sue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The homogenate was
incubated at 55 °C overnight and then puriﬁed following the manu-
facturer’s protocol. The DNA extractions were quantiﬁed using high
sensitivity Qubit ﬂuorometry (Life Technologies, Inc./Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and quality checked using gel elec-
trophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
Library preparation, enrichment and sequencing
Libraries were prepared and enriched following protocols in Fair-
cloth et al. (2015), but following the modiﬁcations detailed below.
Depending on prior degradation and quality of the DNA, between 7
and 100 ng of DNA were sheared between 0 and 60 s (amp = 25%,
pulse = 10–10 s, to a target size of c. 250–600 bp) by sonication
(Q800R; Qsonica LLC, Newtown, CT, USA).
Sheared DNA was dried completely and rehydrated to the
required input volume (13 lL) and used as input for DNA library
preparation (Hyper Prep Library kit; Kapa Biosystems, Inc., Wil-
mington, MA, USA). After ligation of universal stubs (Faircloth and
Glenn, 2012), a 0.89 SPRI bead clean was done (Kapa Pure Beads;
Kapa Biosystems, Inc.) on a Wafergen Apollo liquid handler (Wafer-
gen Biosystems, Fremont, CA, USA), resulting in 30 lL of post-
ligation library. For adapter ligation, we used TruSeq adapters
(Faircloth and Glenn, 2012). PCR conditions were as follows: 15 lL
post-ligation library, 25 lL HiFi HotStart polymerase (Kapa Biosys-
tems), 2.5 lL each of Illumina TruSeq- style i5 and i7 primers, and
5 lL double-distilled water (ddH2O). We used the following thermal
protocol (Kapa Biosystems): 98 °C for 45 s; 13 cycles of 98 °C for
15 s, 65 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s; and ﬁnal extension at 72 °C
for 5 m. PCR cleanup was done with a 0.8 9 SPRI bead clean
(Kapa Pure Beads) on a Wafergen Apollo (TaKaRa Bio Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan) with a ﬁnal library volume of 20 lL. Following
clean-up, libraries were divided into enrichment pools containing
eight libraries combined at equimolar ratios with ﬁnal concentrations
of 137–184 ng/lL.
All pools were enriched with the Spider2Kv1 probes (Kulkarni
et al., 2020) following the myBaits protocol 4.01 (Daicel Arbor Bio-
sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Hybridization reactions were incu-
bated for 24 h at 65 °C, subsequently all pools were bound to
streptavidin beads (MyOne C1; Life Technologies, Inc.), and washed.
We combined 15 lL of streptavidin bead-bound, washed, enriched
library with 25 lL HiFi HotStart Taq (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.), 5 lL
of Illumina TruSeq primer mix (5 lM forward and reverse primers)
and 5 lL of ddH2O. Post-enrichment PCR used the following ther-
mal proﬁle: 98 °C for 45 s; 18 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for
30 s and 72 °C for 60 s; and a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 5 m. We
puriﬁed the resulting reactions using 19 bead clean using Kapa Pure
Beads and resuspended the enriched pools to total 22 lL.
We then quantiﬁed pools using qPCR library quantiﬁcation (Kapa
Biosystems, Inc.) with two serial dilutions of each pool (1:100 000,
1:1 000 000),
assuming
an
average
library
fragment
length
of
600 bp. Based on the size-adjusted concentrations estimated by
qPCR, we combined all pools at an equimolar concentration of
30 nM,
and
size
selected
for
250–600 bp
with
a
BluePippin
(SageScience, Beverly, MA, USA). We sequenced the pooled libraries
in a single lane of a paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500
(2 9 150 bp rapid run) at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer
Institute.

Recovering UCEs from transcriptomes and genomes
We followed the assembly, sanitation and reading frame detection
pipeline as in Fernandez et al. (2018a) for assembling the transcrip-
tomes. Additionally, we ran the Perl script for Rcorrector (Song and
Florea, 2015) for error correction and downstream efﬁciency before
assembly. The FASTA ﬁles of transcriptomes resulting from CD-
HIT-EST
were
converted
to
2-bit
format
using
faToTwoBit
(Kent, 2002). Then, in the PHYLUCE environment (publicly avail-
able
at
https://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-three.html),
we created a temporary relational database to summarize probe to
assembly match using: phyluce_probe_run_multiple_lastzs_sqlite func-
tion on the 2-bit ﬁles. The ultraconserved loci were recovered by the
phyluce_probe_slice_sequence_from_genomes command. The resulting
FASTA ﬁles were treated as contigs and used to match the reads to
the Spider2Kv1 probes.
The GC content can inﬂuence the phylogenetic relationships
reconstructed using genome-scale data (Benjamini and Speed 2012).
To explore this, we computed GC content in each taxon in the
concatenated
UCE
dataset
using
BBMap
(https://github.com/
BioInfoTools/BBMap). We also computed missing data to map their
distribution and compare if they corresponded to the inconsistent
nodes. GC and content and missing data was mapped on the phylog-
eny using the phytools package v.0.7–70 in R Studio v.1.3.1093. We
reanalyzed our UCE dataset with subsequent exclusion of taxa with
high missing data and taxa with stable placement across analyses
were kept and others were omitted from the analysis.
Concatenation of our UCE and legacy marker datasets
The Sanger-based dataset of Wheeler et al. (2017) included the fol-
lowing Sanger-sequenced loci: mitochondrial markers—12S ribo-
somal RNA (12S), 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) and cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 1 (COI); and nuclear markers—protein-coding his-
tone H3 (H3), and small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA genes
(18S and 28S, respectively). Conspeciﬁc taxa with UCE and Sanger-
sequenced data were concatenated. A phylogeny resulting from this
dataset rendered some unusual results in our preliminary analyses,
such as polyphyly of Salticidae, Malkaridae, Thomisidae and Lycosi-
dae, which has been extensively studied and is always recovered as
monophyletic. Therefore, we increased the taxon sampling for these
families based on publicly available sequences, from studies such as
Piacentini and Ramırez (2019), and through bycatch of sequences
from the UCE assemblies. To extract bycatch, we generated a Blast
database of the UCE assembly using Blast+ v.2.9.0, queried against
the longest congeneric legacy marker sequence with an evalue of 1e-
100 and extracted all the sequence matches of Blastn. Each match
was visualized against the original assembly (before ﬁshing out
UCEs) using Geneious v.R10 and the most complete sequence was
binned to concatenate with the UCE sequence. We also concatenated
congeneric taxa to maximize the data completeness (see Table S2).
Our goal to perform this exercise was to maximize the taxon repre-
sentation and minimize the missing data class. For a more stringent
tree search space within the marronoids and Dionycha clade to test
if some of the polyphyletic families are rendered monophyletic, we
compiled two datasets including these taxa and a few outgroups
extracted from the 25% occupancy UCE dataset.
Phylogenomic analyses
UCE dataset: The assembly for de novo generated sequences was
done using SPAdes v.3.14 and, alignment (using Mafft), trimming
(using
GBlocks)
and
concatenation
of
data
were
done
using
the
PHYLUCE
pipeline
(publicly
available
at
https://phyluce.
readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We applied gene occupancies of 10%,
25% and 40% on the UCE dataset. We screened for orthologous
and duplicate loci with the minimum identity, and coverage of 65
and 65 matches. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the unpar-
titioned nucleotide data using IQ-Tree (Nguyen et al., 2015) v.2.
Model selection was allowed for each unpartitioned dataset using
the
TEST
function
(Kalyaanamoorthy
et
al.,
2017,
Hoang
et al., 2018). Nodal support was estimated via 1000 ultrafast boot-
strap replicates (Hoang et al., 2018) with 15 000 iterations. To
reduce the risk of overestimating branch support with ultrafast boot-
strap resulting from model violations, we appended the command -
bnni. With this command, the ultrafast bootstrap optimizes each
bootstrap tree using a hill-climbing nearest neighbour interchange
(NNI) search based on the corresponding bootstrap alignment
(Hoang et al., 2018).
Six-marker Sanger-sequencing dataset: COI and H3 markers were
aligned using MACSE (Ranwez et al., 2011) with the invertebrate
mitochondrial code followed for COI. The remaining markers (12S,
16S, 18S and 28S) were aligned using Mafft v.7 (Katoh and Stand-
ley 2013). Trimming was performed on all alignments using trimAL
(Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009) with -gappyout setting. See Table S2
for a complete list of taxa and concatenation of UCE and six-marker
dataset used in the study. We compared the relationships recon-
structed using parsimony and maximum-likelihood method for a
subset dataset including Araneoidea. We
conducted parsimony
searches using TNT (Goloboff and Catalano, 2016) applying the
tree-building method of Simmons and Goloboff (2014) with 1000
bootstrap replicates.
Results and discussion
Our UCE dataset included 554 taxa representing ten
nonspider arachnids including two Xiphosura (Tachy-
pleus tridentatus and Limulus polyphemus), which were
used to root the phylogeny. This dataset included 125
of the currently known 132 (94.6%) spider families
(World Spider Catalog, 2023). Our Combined dataset
(UCEs+legacy marker datasets) included 1362 taxa
with 131 families (99%) of which 381 taxa were repre-
sented by both data classes (Table S2). Model testing
using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in IQ-
Tree selected the GTR + I + F + G4 model for the
Combined dataset and all matrix occupancies (10%,
25% and 40%) UCE datasets. Statistics of captured
UCE loci are listed in Table S1. The phylogenetic rela-
tionships were overall similar across except that at 1%
and 10% occupancies where Araneidae was sister
group to a clade including Synotaxidae plus Physogle-
nidae and Nesticidae, whereas Araneidae was sister to
Synotaxidae at 25% occupancy. Within the miniature
orb-weaving spiders clade (symphytognathoids), Theri-
diosomatidae formed a sister group to Mysmenidae at
1% and 10% occupancy, whereas Theridiosomatidae
was sister group to the Anterior tracheal system
(ANTS) clade that includes the remaining symphytog-
nathoid families. Although GC-content was high in
some taxa (Fig. S1), omitting them from the analyses
did not alter the resulting phylogenetic relationships.
Missing data were calculated for the UCE dataset,
which was high for several taxa, particularly those that

were sequenced using Arachnid probe set of Starrett
et al. (2017) but matched using the Spider2Kv1 probe
set of Kulkarni et al. (2020) (Fig. S2).
All major clades that were obtained in the most recent
transcriptomes-based study (Kallal et al., 2021a) and
UCEs-based study (Kulkarni et al., 2021) were recovered
in this study with both UCE and Combined datasets.
These lineages include, for example, Araneae, Mesothe-
lae,
Opisthothelae,
Mygalomorphae,
Avicularioidea,
Atypoidea, Araneomorphae, Hypochilidae+Filistatidae,
Synspermiata, Austrochiloidea, Palpimanoidea, Nicoda-
moidea, Retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade, and
Araneoidea. A general structure of relationships between
these major lineages are shown in Fig. 3 and their family-
level relationships are shown in Fig. 4.
Araneae
Platnick & Gertsch (1976) constructed the ﬁrst clad-
ogram about higher level grouping in spiders. They
rejected
the
groupings
by
cheliceral
orientation
(Orthognatha and Labidognatha) and established two
suborders
Mesothelae
and
Opisthothelae
and
two
infraorders
within
Opisthothelae—Mygalomor-
phae and Araneomorphae—which continue to be used
to this day. In this section, we provide a review of the
family-level relationships obtained from our UCE and
Combined datasets and a comparison with prevailing
hypotheses compiled from the literature. We use the
term “Combined phylogeny” to indicate the phyloge-
netic tree resulting from the combination of the UCE-
derived dataset and the Wheeler et al. (2017) six
Sanger-based markers (Figs 5–20).
Mesothelae
This group is an ancient lineage which includes spi-
ders that retain many primitive characters, such as an
externally segmented abdomen, four pairs of multiseg-
mented spinnerets, two pairs of book lungs and chelic-
erae organized at an angle (between paraxial and
diaxial). In addition, their spinnerets are situated near
the middle of the abdomen and abdominal segments
12–18 are present. The extant mesotheles are classiﬁed
in two families, Liphistiidae and Heptathelidae, with
one and seven genera, respectively, and c. 150 species
known mainly from China, Japan and South-east Asia
(Xu et al., 2021; Li, 2022; World Spider Catalog, 2023;
see also Breitling 2022). The oldest mesothele fossils
are from the late Carboniferous period (Magalhaes
et al., 2020). They construct trapdoor burrows (similar
to some mygalomorphs) with radiating trip lines for
prey
capture
(Bristowe,
1976).
The
similarity
of
observable morphological characters in the spider fos-
sils, phylogenetic placement and age (in dated phyloge-
nies) in extant mesotheles indicate that these spiders
retain a plesiomorphic state for many characters.
Haupt (2003) reconstructed a morphology-based clad-
ogram of relationships between the Mesothelae spi-
ders. Morphological synapomorphies of Mesothelae
include presence of abdominal tergites; invaginations
at posteromedian corners of coxae IV; trichobothrial
base on the dorsal surface of distal leg segments
dome-shaped with two ﬂattened plates; ﬂattened spurs
distally on the prolateral and retrolateral sides of tib-
iae I–III; oval, unsclerotized areas situated proximally
on
the
sides
of
metatarsi
I–III
(Platnick
&
Gertsch,
1976;
Platnick
&
Goloboff,
1985;
Haupt, 2003). The phylogenetic placement of these spi-
ders is robust with all previous molecular data (Xu
et al., 2015; Bond et al., 2014; Fernandez et al., 2014,
2018a; Wheeler et al., 2017; Kulkarni et al., 2020,
2021; Ramırez et al., 2021; Kallal et al., 2021a), and
also with our phylogenetic results (Figs 3–5) with
strong support [100% ultrafast bootstrap (UB in
remaining
text)]
which
is
sister
group
to
the
Opisthothelae clade.
Opisthothelae
In Opisthothelae the spinnerets are located close to
the caudal end of the abdomen such that the 12–18
segments are inconspicuous (beyond 5th opisthosomal
segments). This group consists of two major clades,
Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae. Mygalomorph
spiders have paraxial chelicerae and exhibit the plesio-
morphic condition of two pairs of book lungs. Ara-
neomorphae mostly have diaxial (opposing) chelicerae.
However, all Opisthothelae lack the anterior median
spinnerets, although its homologue—the cribellum, a
plate-like ﬁeld with numerous spigots—is present in
many
araneomorph
spiders
(see
Araneomorphae
section).
Our phylogenetic results (Figs 3 and 4) recover a
monophyletic Opisthothelae consisting of two sub-
clades
Mygalomorphae
and
Araneomorphae
with
strong support (100% UB). These results corroborate
other genome-scale molecular studies supporting the
monophyly of these two well-established groups (Bond
et al., 2014; Fernandez et al., 2014, 2018a; Wheeler
et al., 2017; Starrett et al., 2017; Kulkarni et al., 2020,
2021; Ramırez et al., 2021; Kallal et al., 2021a).
Mygalomorphae
Many mygalomorphs are large-sized spiders with
two pairs of book lungs and paraxial fangs. Most spe-
cies have both posterior median and lateral spinnerets,
however, Iberesia (Nemesiidae), from Europe, has only
posterior lateral spinnerets (Decae & Cardoso, 2006).
A majority of these spiders construct silk-lined bur-
rows mainly on the ground with some variations such

as the open burrow of Acanthoscurria (Theraphosidae),
tubular silk-lined burrows with trapdoor of Actinopus
(Actinopodidae), burrow with collar door of Antro-
diaetus (Antrodiaetidae), purse web of Atypus (Atypi-
dae)
and
the
trap-door
found
on
tree
trunks
aboveground (Migidae) (Opatova et al., 2021, Wilson
et al. 2023). There are >3000 mygalomorph described
species classiﬁed in c. 30 families (Opatova et al., 2020;
World Spider Catalog 2023). Raven (1985) reviewed
the systematics, provided the ﬁrst family-level cladistic
hypothesis for this lineage and suggested that that loss
of the anterior median spinnerets, the reduction of the
anterior
lateral
spinnerets
and
the
reduction
of
the number of sclerites in the male palp are synapo-
morphies of the group.
Recent advances using modern sequencing methods
have resulted in radical changes to Mygalomorphae
systematics. Several molecular phylogenies have recov-
ered this group as monophyletic consisting of two sub-
clades
Avicularioidea
and
Atypoidea
(Hedin
and
Bond,
2006;
Bond
et

et al., 2016; Wheeler et al., 2017; Hedin et al., 2018,
2019; Starrett et al., 2017; Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021;
Ramırez et al., 2021; Kallal et al., 2021a; Opatova
et al., 2020) including our phylogenetic results (Figs 3–
5) with strong support (100% UB). The most recent
phylogenetic hypothesis was proposed by Opatova
et al. (2020) based on a densely sampled phylogeny of
mygalomorphs
using
anchored
hybrid
enrichment
(AHE) data.
Our UCE-based phylogeny included representatives
of 23 mygalomorph families including four Atypoidea
(nine terminals) and 19 Avicularioidea families (40 ter-
minals) (Fig. 4). In our analysis, the phylogenetic rela-
tionships within Atypoidea are similar to those of the
UCE-based phylogeny of Hedin et al. (2019) (the
AHE-based
phylogeny
of
Opatova
et
al.,
2021,
included only two atypoid families). The avicularioid
family Euagridae was paraphyletic with one group
representing Allothele, Australothele and Cethegus as a
sister group to a clade of avicularioid families (includ-
ing Ischnothelidae, Hexathelidae and Euagrus) whereas
the other group representing the type genus Euagrus as
a sister group to Ischnothelidae (Fig. 4). The AHE
analysis of Opatova et al. (2021) recovered Ischnotheli-
dae as a sister group to all remaining avicularioid fam-
ilies, and Euagridae including Cethegus and Euagrus
was monophyletic with 100% UB. Aside from this
conﬂicting
hypothesis,
the
familial
relationships
between our UCE phylogeny and that of Opatova
et al. (2020) are mostly congruent. The combination
of
Wheeler
et
al.’s
(2017)
six-marker
dataset
with our UCE dataset elevated the taxon sampling
of Avicularioidea to 82 terminals (24 families). How-
ever, in the resulting phylogeny of this Combined
dataset, Euagridae, Hexathelidae, Ischnothelidae, Bem-
meridae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Halonoproctidae, Barycheli-
dae, Actinopodidae, Nemesiidae and Idiopidae were
not monophyletic (Fig. 5). In our Combined phylog-
eny, the taxon sampling differed from that of Opatova
et al. (2020) owing to multiple reasons. Only 40 of 82
avicularioid terminals were represented by both UCE
and Sanger six-marker datasets (Fig. 5) and thus it is
possible that the missing data may have inﬂuenced
the phylogenetic inference. Incongruent phylogenetic
results also could be attributed to the difference in the
nature of two data classes, the AHE sequences of Opa-
tova et al. (2020) and our UCE + Sanger dataset. Dif-
ferences in the taxon sampling between the studies also
may have caused disparities: for example, Nemesiidae
polyphyly is caused by two Calisoga terminals (Neme-
siidae) representing UCE + Sanger datasets being sis-
ter
to
Anamidae
yet
two
other
nemesiids
from
Wheeler et al.’s (2017) dataset form a sister group to
Fuﬁus (Cyrtaucheniidae). Owing to this limitation, we
do not propose any taxonomic changes.
Araneomorphae
These so-called “modern or true spiders” represent
the most speciose lineage of extant spiders with >100
families, and c. 47 500 species (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023). Synapomorphies of Araneomorphae (Plat-
nick & Gertsch, 1976) include the presence of a
cribellum, piriform silk glands (Coddington, 1989),
diaxial (opposing) chelicerae, by having expanded pal-
pal coxae, forming the endites that bear a distal-lateral
serrula (Ramırez, 2014), and the presence of a single
pair of coxal glands (mesotheles and mygalomorphs
have two pairs; Millot, 1949). Additional support for
the monophyly of this suborder is provided by the
presence of cleistospermia (which refers to the transfer
of individually encapsulated sperm cells) and the type
of cytoplasmic inclusions during spermiogenesis (in the
form of clusters of glycogen surrounded by membranes
after the coiling process; Michalik & Ramırez, 2014,

and references therein). The posterior PLS of araneo-
morphs have one or two segments, whereas mesotheles
have multisegmented PLS and mygalomorphs have
three or four segments (Platnick & Gertsch, 1976).
The cribellum is a short plate-like ﬁeld that is consid-
ered to be homologous to the anterior median spin-
nerets
and
occurs
intermittently
throughout
the
Araneomorphae.
The
cribellum
sits
anterior
to
the three pairs of spinnerets and accommodates thou-
sands of spigots that secrete long-lasting sticky silk
(called “cribellate silk”) which is woven using a func-
tionally co-dependent calamistrum, which is a special-
ized comb of setae on the fourth metatarsus. The
presence of a cribellum was ﬁrst used by Bertkau (1882)
for classiﬁcation of higher groups of spiders into Cri-
bellata and Ecribellata.
Petrunkevitch (1923) postulated that the ecribellate
families are derived from cribellate spiders. In several
araneomorph groups the cribellum is reduced to a
nonfunctional colulus or lost altogether. Piriform silk
glands,
another
synapomorphy
of
araneomorphs,
secrete glue that anchors ampullate silk lines to a sub-
strate or to stick them to each other. This glue is
released through spigots (called “piriform spigots”)
which are adjacent to the major ampullate spigots on
the anterior lateral spinnerets (Coddington 1989).
Araneomorphae is a well-established clade, robustly
supported in all morphological and molecular phyloge-
nies
(Platnick
&
Gertsch,
1976;

Hypochilidae and Filistatidae
Hypochilidae is a small family of 33 cribellate species
which includes the two genera Hypochilus and Ectatos-
ticta which are known exclusively from the United
States and China, respectively (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023). Hypochilus spiders construct a mesh web
resembling a lampshade attached to a rock overhang
and the spider rests in the middle of the web (called
“lampshade web”; Forster et al., 1987). Ectatosticta spi-
ders construct sheet webs among rocks or tree trunks
(Lin & Li, 2020). Marx (1888) who described the ﬁrst
hypochilid, Hypochilus thorelli Marx, 1888, remarked
that this spider “is so anomalous that it appears like the
representative of a prototype, in which characters were
united in one individual which are now distributed into
widely differing genera”. It is one of the relictual groups
of “modern” (Araneomorphae) spiders that retain the
primitive arrangement of two pairs of book lungs and
venom glands restricted to the chelicerae (Gertsch, 1958)
and that lack paracribellar spigots from posterior
median spinnerets (Forster et al., 1987).
The transcriptomic analysis of Bond et al. (2014)
recovered Filistatidae as the sister group to Hypochili-
dae, an afﬁnity grouping based on morphology ﬁrst sug-
gested by Petrunkevitch (1923). Filistatidae is a large
family with 18 genera and 189 species distributed glob-
ally (World Spider Catalog, 2023). They are reclusive,
mostly cribellate spiders, with most species found in
subtropical arid and semiarid regions of the world
(Magalhaes & Ramırez 2019). The synapomorphies of
this family are a narrow metatarsus stopper (narrow
socket associated to the lyriform organ) in second legs
of males, an anterior row of specialized setae in the
anterior lateral spinnerets, an anteriorly pronounced
clypeus and a tongue-like labrum with lateral extensions
(Magalhaes & Ramırez 2017). Adult members of this
family possess an anterior book lung system and a pos-
terior tracheal system. However, remnants of the primi-
tive
posterior
pair
of
book
lungs
are
seen
in
their spiderlings (Ramırez 2014, Ramırez et al., 2021).
In our study, these early diverging lineages of araneo-
morph spiders form a clade which is a sister group to
Synspermiata (Fig. 6c). All high-throughput molecular
data and Sanger-sequenced markers support this place-
ment of the Hypochilidae + Filistatidae clade (Bond
et al., 2014, Garrison et al., 2016, Wheeler et al., 2017,
Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021,
Kallal et al., 2021a).
Synspermiata
The name of this group was coined by Michalik &
Ramırez (2014), it includes ecribellate haplogyne spi-
ders
which
have
multiple
spermatids
fused
into
one synsperm (Alberti & Weinmann, 1985; Burger
et al., 2010). In general, spiders with a haplogyne con-
dition have relatively simple male genitalia with fused
sclerites and female genitalia with a single duct for
both
copulation
and
fertilization
(Platnick
et al., 1991), but some haplogyne spiders have complex
palps (e.g. liphistiids). Several studies have shown that
the
internal
genitalia
of
some
haplogyne
spiders
also are very complex, departing from the traditional
deﬁnition
of
the
haplogyne
female
genitalia
of
Wiehle (1967) (e.g. Burger et al., 2003, and references
therein). At least in some Synspermiata, males insert
both palps simultaneously when mating, which is a
unique behaviour in this group (Burger et al., 2010).
Some synspermiate members of the Pholcidae, Tetra-
blemmidae, Oonopidae, Ochyroceratidae and Troglor-
aptoridae
are
known
to
have
evolved
entelegyne
condition independently (Michalik et al., 2019). Syn-
spermiata includes three monophyletic groups, Dysder-
oidea, Scytodoidea and the Lost Tracheae clade, in
addition to the families Caponiidae, Telemidae and
Trogloraptoridae.
The
Dysderoidea
families
are
grouped by having a unique respiratory system of

tracheae placed immediately behind the book lungs
and an additional posterior sperm receptacle (divertic-
ulum) and muscle-operated valves, which allow for
control of the stored sperm by the female (Bur-
ger, 2013). Caponiids have advanced tracheal spiracles
(book lungs are absent) and eye reductions and are rel-
atively larger than other spiders with only tracheal sys-
tems
(Platnick,
1994;
Ramırez,
2000).
Trogloraptoridae is an unusual family of a single cave-
dwelling species—Trogloraptor marchingtoni Griswold,
Audisio & Ledford, 2012—with characteristic striking
raptorial claws, known from caves and their surround-
ings
in
the
western
United
States
(Griswold
et al., 2012a). Telemidae spiders have a global distribu-
tion, with 16 genera classiﬁed in 106 species (World
Spider Catalog, 2023). They produce large stacks of
sperm cells (called rouleaux or spermatophores) which
correspond with the dimensions of the female repro-
ductive
tract
(Wang
et
al.,
2012;
Michalik
&
Ramırez, 2014). A study on Telema tenella Simon,
1882 showed that these spiders can live for up to
12 years in captivity (and produce about four egg
cases
each
containing
3–4
eggs
annually;
Juberthie 1985), a lifespan that is much longer than
many araneomorph spiders. The Lost Tracheae clade
includes the spider families Diguetidae, Pacullidae,
Pholcidae, Plectreuridae and Tetrablemmidae. As the
name suggests, these spiders have secondarily lost the
posterior respiratory system (Ramırez 2000). Pholcidae
is the most speciose family of the Lost Tracheae clade,
with 1896 species classiﬁed in 97 genera distributed
globally, the remaining families of this clade are rela-
tively less speciose.
All molecular data, such as the six Sanger-sequenced
markers, transcriptomes and UCEs, have supported
the monophyly of Synspermiata and its sister group
relationship with the Hypochilidae plus Filistatidae
clade (Wheeler et al., 2017; Garrison et al., 2016;
Fernandez et al., 2018a; Michalik et al., 2019; Kulk-
arni et al., 2020, 2021; Ramırez et al., 2021; Kallal
et al., 2021a).
In
our
Combined
phylogeny,
the
Dysderoidea
clade
(Oonopidae,
Segestriidae,
Orsolobidae
and
Dysderidae) was the sister group to Caponiidae. Tro-
gloraptoridae and Telemidae formed a clade which
was sister group Scytodoidea and the Lost Tracheae
clade (Fig. 6a). In the transcriptomic analysis of
Kallal
et
al.
(2021a)
and
the
UCE
analysis
of
Ramırez
et
al.
(2021)
and
this
study,
Trogloraptoridae formed a sister group to Caponii-
dae whereas Telemidae was a sister group to a large
clade including Scytodoidea and the Lost Tracheae
clade (Fig. 4). The sister group to Dysderidae in our
Combined phylogeny was Orsolobidae (99% UB),
similar to the results of Wheeler et al. (2017) and
Ramırez
et al. (2021),
whereas
the
UCE dataset
placed dysderids as a sister group to Segestriidae +
Orsolobidae (Figs 4 and 6a). However, within the
Dysderoidea clade, Oonopidae was a sister group to
remaining families in our study (Fig. 6a), whereas
Segestriidae was a sister group to the remaining dys-
deroids in Wheeler et al. (2017). A further study
exploring the effect of data classes (such as exons,
introns, UCEs) and taxon sampling on the inter-
relationships of Synspermiata may be useful in deriv-
ing a robust phylogeny of these spiders.
Austrochiloidea
Austrochiloid spiders form an ancient lineage in
the evolution of araneomorph spiders (Platnick 1977;
Forster et al., 1987; Wheeler et al., 2017; Fernandez
et
al.,
2018a;
Kallal
et
al.,
2021a;
Kulkarni
et al., 2021; Ramırez et al., 2021). This group is com-
posed of two families, Austrochilidae and Gradunguli-
dae, that are distributed in the Southern Hemisphere.
The early divergence of these spiders, supported by
their phylogenetic placement within Araneomorphae,
is suggested by the retention of the plesiomorphic con-
ﬁguration of two pairs of book lungs in some members
such as Hickmania (Gradungulidae, formerly placed in
Austrochilidae) (Zapfe, 1955; Platnick, 1977; Forster
et
al.,
1987;
Ramırez
et
al.,
2021;
Kulkarni
&
Hormiga, 2021).
Many austrochiloids are cribellate, but some species,
such as those in Gradungula or Tarlina, are cursorial
species and have lost the cribellum.
Austrochilidae includes nine species classiﬁed in two
genera (Austrochilus and Thaida) which are distributed
in the Andean forests of central and southern Chile
and adjoining regions of Argentina. These spiders have
one pair of book lungs and a posterior tracheal respi-
ratory system (Zapfe, 1955; Platnick, 1977; Forster
et al., 1987). Gradungulidae includes 17 species classi-
ﬁed in eight genera restricted to continental Australia
and New Zealand. They have retained the plesio-
morphic
character
of
two
book
lung
pairs
(Zapfe, 1955).

Leptonetidae and Archoleptonetidae
Leptonetidae is a family of 22 genera grouping
375 described species distributed exclusively in the
Holarctic region. Many of these species are cave-dwelling,
and construct small and delicate sheet webs. Cave-
adapted species show troglomorphic morphologies such
as reduction of eyes, poor pigmentation and elongation

of appendages (Ledford & Griswold, 2010; Ledford
et al., 2012; Mammola & Isaia, 2017).
The relationship of leptonetids to other groups
have been tangled since the discovery of a functional cri-
bellum in Archoleptoneta (the organ is absent in other
Leptonetidae). Researchers have cast doubt on its place-
ment within Leptonetidae (Ledford & Griswold, 2010;
Ledford et al., 2011) and suggested that this family could
be paraphyletic, but without making any change in the
classiﬁcation. Later, Wheeler et al. (2017) did recover a
polyphyletic Leptonetidae. An analysis of UCE-derived
data suggested that the subfamily Archoleptonetinae
(which
includes
only
two
genera,
the
cribellate
Archoleptoneta and the ecribellate Darkoneta) do not
nest within the clade containing other leptonetids
(Ramırez et al., 2021). This subfamily then was elevated
to
family
rank
as
Archoleptonetidae
by
Ledford
et al. (2021). This phylogenetic placement seems to be
sensitive to data class and/or taxon sampling because,
the transcriptomic data treated as amino acids, with
three genera sampled, suggest that Archoleptoneta (Arch-
oleptonetidae), Calileptoneta and Leptoneta (both Lepto-
netidae) form a clade (Kallal et al., 2021a). Likewise, our
UCE dataset representing two Archoleptonetidae and 12
Leptonetidae genera recovered a clade including the two
families (Fig. S3). In our Combined dataset with more

archoleptonetids (ﬁve terminals), Archoleptonetidae was
the sister group to a clade including the Austrochiloi-
dea+Leptonetidae clade (Fig. 6d).
Palpimanoidea
Palpimanoids are a group of spiders known for their
unusual chelicerae and carapace morphologies and asso-
ciated predatory behaviours, many of which forage
predominantly on other spiders using a variety of preda-
tory tactics (see Wood et al., 2012). This group consists
of ﬁve extant families which occur primarily in the
Southern Hemisphere: Archaeidae, Huttoniidae, Mecys-
maucheniidae, Palpimanidae and Stenochilidae. Palpi-
manoids have peg teeth on the pro-margin of the
paturon, a cheliceral gland mound, and most have dense
scopulae on the ﬁrst pair of legs (Wood et al., 2012).

gland mounds in Mimetidae and Pararchaeidae, both
characters reduced in Holarchaeidae, Micropholcom-
matidae and Textricellidae, chelicerae originating from
a sclerotized foramen in the carapace in Pararchaeidae,
a convex carapace in Micropholcommatidae and Textri-
cellidae, with Holarchaeidae having an intermediate
state between the two (Forster & Platnick, 1984). All
these taxa are now placed in Araneoidea as follows:
Pararchaeinae (Malkaridae), Holarchaea, Textricellini
and Micropholcommatinae (Anapidae) based on multiple
phylogenetic studies (Sch€utt, 2000; Rix & Harvey, 2010a;
Lopardo et al., 2011; Dimitrov et al., 2017).
A combination of morphology and four Sanger-
sequenced
genetic
markers
strongly
supported
the
monophyly of Palpimanoidea. However, six genetic
markers (without morphology) recovered a poorly sup-
ported
paraphyletic
grouping
for
Palpimanoidea
(Wheeler et al., 2017). In our UCE phylogeny, Palpima-
noidea was monophyletic and formed a sister group to
entelegyne spiders with strong support (Figs 3 and 4).
This placement of Palpimanoidea within the spider phy-
logeny and its interfamilial relationships were previously
recovered
in
the
transcriptome-based
analyses
of
Fernandez et al. (2018a) and Kallal et al. (2021a), the
UCE-based analyses of Wood et al. (2018), Kulkarni
et al. (2020) and Ramırez et al. (2021), and in analyses
combining UCEs and transcriptomic datasets (Kulkarni
et al., 2021). This relationship is of interest because the
Entelegynae spiders contain the bulk of araneomorph
spider species diversity, while palpimanoids contain
only c. 300 species (World Spider Catalog, 2023). The
extensive fossil record of palpimanoids indicates that
this group and Synspermiata were once dominant in the
Mesozoic, with faunal turnover giving way to domi-
nance of other Araneomorphae clades, Araneoidea and
the RTA-clade, in the Cenozoic (Magalhaes et al.,
2021).
Within Palpimanoidea, Palpimanidae is the sister
group to the remaining four families (Fig. 7), a result
also found by Wood et al. (2018). However, transcrip-
tomes analysed as amino acids recover Palpimanidae
plus Stenochilidae as a clade (Kallal et al., 2021a).
Huttonidae + Mecysmaucheniidae diverged next and
are the sister group to a clade containing Archaeidae +
Stenochilidae (Fig. 7), contradicting the results of
Wood et al. (2018). Our UCE data recovered Archaei-
dae as the sister group to Mecysmaucheniidae and Ste-
nochilidae + Huttonidae.
Alternative placements have been obtained in other
UCE and transcriptome-based studies. For example,
on the one hand, the Huttonidae plus Stenochilidae
clade
was
recovered
using
UCE
data
in
Wood
et al. (2018) and Kulkarni et al. (2021), yet this branch
was poorly supported in both studies. On the other
hand, morphology
alone
recovers Archaeidae
and
Mecysmaucheniidae as sister groups, that are sister to
Palpimanidae + Stenochilidae, and with Huttoniidae
the earliest diverging total evidence analysis results in
Mecysmaucheniidae
as
the
earliest
diverging
and
Archaeidae + Stenochilidae sister to Huttoniidae + Pal-
pimanidae (Wood et al., 2012).
Entelegynae
The araneomorph lineages which are a sister group to
the Palpimanoidea clade form the Entelegynae clade
(>80% of spider diversity). The entelegyne male genitalia,
in general, is relatively more complex than haplogyne gen-
italia, and has distinct sclerites (sclerite morphology
generally serves as synapomorphies for many entelegyne
spider
groups)
and
the
female
genitalia
has
a
“ﬂow-through” system, with separate copulatory and fer-
tilization ducts (Griswold et al., 2005). The early diverg-
ing
araneomorph
groups
such
as
Hypochilidae,
Filistatidae, Synspermiata and Palpimanoidea have hap-
logyne genitalia. It is noteworthy that at least three rever-
sals
to
the
haplogyne
condition
are
known
to
have occurred in the Entelegynae—in some tetragnathids,
uloborids and anapids (Lopardo & Hormiga, 2015).
Recently, Michalik et al. (2019) inferred that the entele-
gyne condition has evolved at least six times indepen-
dently
in
the
Synspermiata
families,
Pholcidae,
Tetrablemmidae,
Oonopidae,
Ochyroceratidae
and
Trogloraptoridae.
Molecular phylogenies consistently support the mono-
phyly of Entelegynae (Garrison et al., 2016; Wheeler
et al., 2017; Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kulkarni et al., 2020,
2021; Kallal et al., 2021a), including our study (Figs 3
and 4). Our phylogeny suggests that Araneoidea is a sister
group to a clade that includes all the remaining entele-
gynes. In the latter clade, Nicodamoidea + Eresidae are
sister to a large lineage that includes the UDOH grade
(see below) and the retrolateral tibial apophysis clade
(RTA clade). This topology is corroborated by the UCE-
based phylogeny of Kulkarni et al. (2020) and the
AllUCEs
dataset
(nucleotide
data
of
UCEs
+
transcriptomes) of Kulkarni et al. (2021). The recent tran-
scriptomic analysis of Kallal et al. (2021a) suggested that
UDOH grade + RTA clade is a sister group to the
remaining entelegyne spiders. In that study, Eresidae was
a sister group to the Nicodamoidea + Araneoidea clade.
Araneoidea
This lineage of 17 ecribellate spider families includes
the largest diversity of web architectures, a few exam-
ples of which include the orbicular web (Araneidae,
“symphytognathoids”, Tetragnathidae), the cob web
(Theridiidae, Nesticidae) and the sheet web (Cyatholi-
pidae,
Linyphiidae,
Pimoidae),
along
with
several
instances of foraging web loss (these spiders are
instead active or sit-and-wait hunters) (e.g. Mimetidae,

Malkaridae, Arkyidae). Orbicular webs (webs with dis-
tinct radii and spiral) also are built by two other fami-
lies outside Araneoidea—Deinopidae and Uloboridae
(both cribellate)—which belong to the UDOH grade
assemblage (see UDOH grade section below).
Untangling the relationships among the araneoid spi-
ders families has been a challenging task (reviewed in
Hormiga & Griswold 2014), because various data types
such as morphology (Coddington, 1990), morphology
and behaviour (Griswold et al., 1998), Sanger-sequenc-
ing-based on six markers (Dimitrov et al., 2012, 2017;
Wheeler et al., 2017; Scharff et al., 2020), transcriptomes
(Fernandez et al., 2014, 2018a, b; Kallal et al., 2021a)
and UCEs (Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021) have recovered
some conﬂicting phylogenetic relationships. For exam-
ple, the placement of Araneidae varies across datasets:
morphological data recover the family as sister group
to the remaining araneoids (Griswold et al., 1998),
Sanger-based sequences as sister group to Theridioso-
matidae + Synotaxidae (Dimitrov et al., 2017) or Syno-
taxidae (Scharff et al., 2020, Theridisomatidae was not
sampled) or as a sister group to Theridiosomatidae
with transcriptomes (Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kallal
et al., 2021a), and UCEs sequences place araneids as the
sister group to Synotaxidae (Kulkarni et al., 2020,
2021). Another example is provided by the miniature
orb-weaving
spiders
(the
“symphythognathoids”;
see section below): morphological data suggested that
these families are grouped in a clade (Coddington,
1986b; Griswold, 1990; Sch€utt, 2003; Lopardo & Hor-
miga, 2008; Lopardo et al., 2011), a hypothesis rejected
by the analyses of Sanger-based sequences and tran-
scriptomes, but supported by UCE data (Kulkarni
et al., 2020, 2021).
Araneoidea includes spiders with a characteristic
conﬁguration of spigots on the posterior lateral spin-
nerets—one
ﬂagelliform
gland
and
two
aggregate
gland spigots, a synapomorphy of the group (Codding-
ton, 1989; Griswold et al., 1998). The ﬂagelliform and
aggregate glands work in tandem to produce the sticky
thread (Kovoor, 1977; Coddington, 1989) of the cap-
ture spiral.
These araneoid triplet spigots may be reduced in
some spiders such as Cepheia longiseta (Simon, 1881)
(Synaphridae) (Lopardo & Hormiga, 2008) or absent
(Mimetidae) (Platnick & Shadab, 1993). All genome-
scale based phylogenies recover Theridiidae as a sister
group to a lineage that includes all remaining araneoid
families (Garrison et al., 2016; Fernandez et al., 2018a;
Shao & Li, 2018; Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021; Kallal
et al., 2021a) (Fig. 4). The transcriptome-based phy-
logeny of Fernandez et al. (2018a) placed Theridiidae
as the sister group to Anapidae.
However, the inclusion of Symphytognathidae repre-
sentatives
in
the
transcriptomic
dataset
of
Kallal
et
al.
(2021a)
placed
Anapidae
as
sister
to
Symphytognathidae, similar to the results of the UCE-
based phylogeny of Kulkarni et al. (2021). Our parsi-
mony analysis recovered Theridiidae as a sister group to
the remaining araneoids; monophyly of symphytog-
nathoids and tetragnathoids were recovered, yet the
Pimoidae + Linyphiidae clade was not recovered (Figs 8–
1 and S4).
Theridiidae
Theridiids or cobweb spiders are the third largest
family (after Linyphiidae and Araneidae) in Araneoidea
with >2500 species grouped in 125 genera distributed
worldwide (World Spider Catalog, 2023). The black
widow spider genus Latrodectus known for its sexual
cannibalism
(Andrade,
1996)
and
potent
toxicity
(Clarke et al., 2014), and the common house spider
Parasteatoda tepidariorum (C. L. Koch, 1841) are mem-
bers of this family. Parasteatoda tepidariorum has been
widely studied in research on evolutionary and develop-
mental biology, and is considered as a model organism
(reviewed in Oda and Akiyama-Oda, 2020). Theridiids
are of interest
beyond taxonomy and systematics
because of their ecological diversity, perhaps the largest
among spider families, as illustrated by diversity of web
architectures (e.g. Eberhard et al., 2008a, b) and the
independent evolution of kleptoparasitism (e.g. Voll-
rath, 1979), sociality (e.g. Agnarsson et al., 2006), and
myrmecophagy (e.g. Lıznarova & Pekar, 2019).
Theridiid spiders also are known as “comb-footed”
spiders owing to the presence of a row of bristled setae
on their fourth tarsus used to direct and manipulate
viscid sticky silk to entangle the prey. A similar tarsal
comb has independently evolved in another Araneoi-
dea family, Nesticidae, and in the non-araneoid Phol-
cidae (Huber & Fleckenstein, 2008).
Lehtinen & Saaristo (1980) placed Nesticidae and
Theridiidae in different superfamilies claiming that
these setae are “purely adaptive”, thus suggesting con-
vergent evolution of this trait. However, Codding-
ton
(1989)
grouped
Theridiidae
and
Nesticidae
together based on the enlarged aggregate spigots and
the presence of the fourth tarsal comb and its associa-
tion with the behaviour of prey capture. Griswold
et al. (1998) proposed synapomorphies for Theridiidae
plus Nesticidae (which they called “theridioids”) that
included presence of a ‘theridiid tegular apophysis’ (a
sclerite of the male pedipalp), fourth tarsal comb,
enlarged aggregate gland spigots on the posterior lat-
eral spinnerets, and the construction of gumfoot webs.
However, to date, no molecular analysis has ever sup-
ported
the
monophyly
of
theridioids
(Dimitrov
et al., 2012, 2017; Wheeler et al., 2017).
The morphological hypothesis about the internal
relationships of Theridiidae recovered Hadrotarsinae
(minute ant specialist theridiids with reduced/no webs)

as a sister group to a clade composed of Latrodectinae
(a monophyletic subfamily) plus remaining theridiids
(Agnarsson, 2004). Arnedo et al. (2004) reconstructed
the ﬁrst molecular phylogeny of the family Theridii-
dae. In their molecular phylogeny, a clade including
the subfamily Latrodectinae and the genera Anelosimus
(in part Selkirkiella), Pholcomma and Robertus, were a
sister group to the remaining theridiids. An incremen-
tal taxon sampling of Liu et al. (2016) recovered
Latrodectinae as a sister clade to the remaining theri-
diid lineages.
Our UCE-based phylogeny recovered Latrodectinae
as the sister group to a clade including all remaining
theridiids, which were represented by nine genera (15
terminals) (Figs 8b, S3 and S4). Our Combined phy-
logeny,
however,
recovered
a
larger
clade
which
included a monophyletic Latrodectinae as a sister
group to paraphyletic Pholcommatinae (Enoplognatha
and Pholcomma) and Argyrodinae (Ariamnes, Argyr-
odes and Neospintharus) and other theridiids (Fig. 8).
The “lost colulus” clade, which includes Theridiinae
and Anelosiminae [a grouping proposed by Agnars-
son (2004) based on the absence of a colulus and colu-
lar
setae],
was
also
recovered
in
our
Combined
analysis (Fig. 8). In the UCE phylogeny, Euryopis
(Hadrotarsinae) was a sister group to the Theridiinae
+ Anelosiminae clade with high support (99% UB)
(Fig. 8).
Symphytognathoid clade
This clade includes four or ﬁve families of minute
spiders (<2 mm) known as the “symphytognathoids”
(an
informal
group
name
proposed
by
Coddington, 1986b): Anapidae, Mysmenidae, Symphy-
tognathidae and Theridiosomatidae, most of which
construct
orb-webs
(Eberhard,
1986)
with
various
degrees
of
architectural
modiﬁcations.
Lopardo
et al. (2011) added Synaphridae to this group based on
a phylogenetic analysis combining morphological and
molecular data. Symphytognathoid webs are architec-
turally quite diverse ranging from typical orb webs to
a multitude of variation such as irregular webs and
sheet webs. Some symphytognathoids are kleptopara-
sites that do not build any foraging webs, but instead
occupy the webs of their host spider. Most mysmenids
build spherical or planar orbs, symphytognathids build
a two-dimensional horizontal orb web, theridiosoma-
tids build orb webs (although some of them are highly
modiﬁed, e.g. sticky lines connected to water surface),
anapids build orb webs with out of plane radii, and at
least some synaphrids build sheet or irregular webs
(Coddington, 1986b; Coddington and Valerio, 1980;
Eberhard 1986; Rix and Harvey, 2010b; Lopardo
et al., 2011, Cotoras et al., 2021). In each of these
“symphytognathoid”
families
(except
Synaphridae),
there is at least one genus with a kleptoparasitic life-
style, accompanied by loss of the foraging web, in all
its constituent species. For example, Mysmenopsis fur-
tiva Coyle & Meigs, 1989 (Mysmenidae) and Curima-
gua
bayano
Forster
&
Platnick,
1977
(Symphytognathidae) live in the webs of diplurid spi-
ders (Griswold et al., 1998; Vollrath, 1978), and Sofa-
napis antillanca Platnick & Forster, 1989 (Anapidae)
live in the sheet webs of austrochilids (Ramırez &
Platnick, 1999).
The genealogical relationships of the symphytog-
nathoids themselves have an interesting history. The
monophyly of “symphytognathoids” has been sup-
ported by morphological and behavioural characters
(Coddington,
1986b;
Eberhard,
1986;
Griswold
et al., 1998; Sch€utt, 2003; Lopardo & Hormiga, 2008;
Lopardo et al., 2011; Hormiga & Griswold, 2014), but
they have appeared as either paraphyletic or polyphy-
letic in molecular phylogenies using the six Sanger-
based markers (Dimitrov et al., 2012, 2017; Wheeler
et al., 2017) or transcriptomes (Fernandez et al., 2018a;
Kallal et al., 2021a). Dimitrov et al. (2017) obtained
Anapidae as paraphyletic with “Anapidae I” (repre-
sented by Anapis, one micropholcommatine genus
(Taphiassa) and Holarchaea) as sister to Theridiidae
and “Anapidae II” (represented by Gerstchanapis, Max-
anapis and Chasmocephalon) as sister to Cyatholipidae.
The “Anapidae II” plus Cyatholipidae clade was sister
to
the
Symphytognathidae
lineage.
Lopardo
et al.’s (2011) extensive Sanger-based dataset supported
“symphytognathoid” monophyly only when the nucleo-
tide data were analysed in combination with phenotypic
data. It is noteworthy that transcriptomic data, ana-
lysed as amino acids in a maximum-likelihood frame-
work,
recovered
polyphyletic
origins
of “symphytognathoids” (Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kal-
lal et al., 2021a). In a parsimony analysis, Kallal
et al. (2020) recovered Theridiosomatidae as sister to
Araneidae, while the other “symphytognathoid” fami-
lies formed a monophyletic group. An analysis of UCEs
using a small sample of symphytognathoids (16 species
in all families except Synaphridae and representatives of
all other araneoid families) provided the ﬁrst empirical
support for symphytognathoid monophyly using molec-
ular data alone, with the analysed low occupancy data-
sets (Kulkarni et al., 2020). A further integrated
sampling obtained by extracting UCEs from transcrip-
tomes found that Synaphridae too are nested within
symphytognathoids (Kulkarni et al., 2021, 2023). All
prior molecular analyses, including Sanger-sequencing-

tomes, rejected the monophyly of symphytognathoids.
Interestingly, the polyphyly of this group received high
ultrafast bootstrap support by transcriptomes. This par-
adox of highly supported but incongruent relationships
across phylogenomic datasets was explored through

analyses of exons, ultraconserved loci, a combination of
these data as amino acids and nucleotides which recov-
ered monophyly of “symphytognathoids” (Kulkarni
et al., in 2021). This discordance resulting from nucleo-
tide (rendering monophyly) and amino acid data (recov-
ering
polyphyly)
between
the
position
of
symphytognathoids
within
Araneoidea
was
also
observed in the 99-target enrichment study of Shao
et al. (2023). This paradox is not unique to these spi-
ders, but also has been observed in snakes (e.g. Klein
et al., 2021), birds (e.g. Cloutier et al., 2019) and other
arachnids (e.g. Ballesteros et al., 2021). A recent study
by Kulkarni et al. (2023) focused on symphytognathoid
phylogenomics using UCEs and a combination with six
standard markers recovered monophyly of this group.
This placement rendered transformation of anterior tra-
cheae to book lungs and the reduction and loss of the
posterior tracheae multiple times. The symphytog-
nathoid ancestral orb was lost four times and trans-
formed to sheet web once (Kulkarni et al. 2023).
Our UCE and Combined datasets recovered the sym-
phytognathoids clade (Figs 3, 4, 9, S3 and S4). Theri-
diosomatidae formed a sister group to the remaining
symphytognathoids, a lineage referred to as the “Ante-
rior tracheal system clade” by Lopardo et al. (2011).
Interestingly, Trogloneta, an unusual mysmenid with
fused chelicerae (Sch€utt, 2003) similar to Symphytog-
nathidae spiders, was placed as a sister group to
Synaphridae + Symphytognathidae with high support
(95% UB; Fig. 9). This genus has been placed within
Mysmenidae (Lopardo et al., 2011, Lopardo and Hor-
miga, 2015). Among Anapidae, both UCEs and the
Combined
dataset
recovered
micropholcommatines
nested with Anapidae (Fig. 9), similar to the total evi-
dence analysis of Lopardo et al. (2011).
Linyphioids clade
This
clade
was
informally
named
by
Hormiga (1994a, 2000) to group the families Linyphii-
dae and Pimoidae. The monophyly of linyphioids is
supported by the following synapomorphies: cheliceral
stridulatory striae, patella-tibia autospasy, enlargement
of the peripheral cylindrical spigot base on the poste-
rior lateral spinnerets, a 9 + 0 axonemal pattern in the
sperm and an ectal cymbial process in the male palp
(Hormiga,
1993,
1994a,
b;
Michalik
and
Hor-
miga, 2010; Hormiga et al., 2021).
Linyphiidae is the second largest family of spiders and
the largest in Araneoidea with c. 4850 species classiﬁed in
636 genera. About 10% of all described spiders are liny-
phiids (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Although the ances-
tral web of Araneoidea probably was an orb (Fernandez
et al., 2018a; Kallal et al., 2021a), linyphiids build sheet
webs of varying degrees of complexity (Hormiga & Eber-
hard, 2023). These spiders are distributed globally, but are
more abundant at higher elevations, particularly in tem-
perate regions (Hormiga, 1994b), contrary to the typical
biological pattern of increasing species diversity towards
the equator (Lomolino, 2004).
Linyphiids have been found on most oceanic islands,
far away from continental masses, such as Saint Hel-
ena,
Tristan
da
Cunha
and
the
Juan
Fernandez
islands. In the latter archipelago 15 endemic species of
Laminacauda and ten species of Neomaso occur, sug-
gesting their long dispersal abilities (Arnedo & Hor-
miga 2021). Linyphiidae have been classiﬁed into
several
subfamilies
(Mynogleninae,
Dubiaraneinae,
Erigoninae, Linyphiinae, Micronetinae, Ipainae and
Stemonyphantinae) although no comprehensive phylo-
genetic classiﬁcation exists for the family and only
some of the existing subfamilies have been corrobo-
rated as clades (e.g. Stemonyphantinae and Mynogle-
ninae), whereas others have never been repeatedly
shown not to be monophyletic (e.g. Dubiraneinae or
Micronetinae)
(Hormiga,
2000;
Miller
&
Hor-
miga, 2004; Arnedo et al., 2009; Frick & Scharff, 2018;
Wang et al., 2015; Hormiga et al., 2021). In our com-
bined analysis, Stemonyphantinae and Mynogleninae
were monophyletic whereas Erigoninae, and Microne-
tinae were polyphyletic (Fig. 10a).
Wunderlich (1986) suggested that Pimoa was the
sister group to Linyphiidae and accommodated it in
a new subfamily (Pimoinae), which Hormiga (1993)
elevated
to
family
rank.
Hormiga
(1994a) mono-
graphed Pimoidae, and added new species to Pimoa.
Subsequently,
the
genera
Weintrauboa
(Hor-
miga
2003),
Nanoa
(Hormiga
et
al.,
2005),
and
Putaoa (Hormiga & Tu 2008) were placed in Pimoi-
dae based on morphology-based cladistic analyses.
However,
molecular
phylogenies
using
the
six
markers, transcriptomes and UCEs recovered a para-
phyletic
Pimoidae
with
Weintrauboa
and
Putaoa
nesting in Linyphiidae (Dimitrov et al., 2012, 2017;
Wang et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2017; Fernandez
et al., 2018a; Kallal et al., 2021a). More recently,
Hormiga et al. (2021) addressed the placement of
Weintrauboa
and
Putaoa
using
Sanger-sequencing
data and formalized the transfer of Weintrauboa and
Putaoa
to
linyphiid
subfamily
Stemonyphantinae.
The remaining two genera, Nanoa and Pimoa were
hypothesized to be sister groups based on their male
genitalic morphology (Hormiga et al., 2005), which
was
corroborated
by
molecular
data
(Dimitrov
et al., 2012, 2017; Hormiga et al., 2021). Our study
also placed Weintrauboa and Putaoa in Stemony-
phantinae, and Pimoa and Nanoa form the Pimoidae
clade (Fig. 10a). Currently, Pimoidae includes 86
species classiﬁed in two genera with Nanoa (with the
single species N. enana) from the United States and
Pimoa with 85 species distributed in the Holarctic
region (World Spider Catalog, 2023).

Cyatholipidae
This is a meso-diverse family with 58 species classi-
ﬁed into 23 genera distributed in Africa, Madagascar,
Australia and New Zealand where they construct
sheet webs generally in moist forests or mesic forests
(Griswold, 1987, 2001; World Spider Catalog, 2023).
Griswold
(2001)
proposed
the
ﬁrst
phylogenetic
hypothesis using morphology. In our Combined data-
set, Tekella and Tekelloides form a clade similar to
Griswold (2001), yet the genera were not monophyletic
(Fig. 10b). The genera Alaranea, Cyatholipus, Scharfﬁa
and Ulwembua formed a clade, whereas in Gris-
wold’s (2001) analysis these genera did not form a
clade.
Malkaridae + “tetragnathoids” clade
Malkaridae is a family of 57 species classiﬁed in 13
genera distributed in the southern hemisphere with a
monotypic genus known from Chile and Argentina
(Chilenodes) and the remaining from Australia, New
Zealand and New Caledonia (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023). They are web-less, active hunters that live
in the leaf litter and mosses of temperate and tropical
wet forests (Platnick & Forster, 1987; Rix, 2006; Rix
& Harvey, 2010a; Hormiga & Scharff, 2020). These
spiders are relatively difﬁcult to ﬁnd leading to few
specimens in natural history collections and scarce
information. Furthermore, some of their morphologi-
cal features made it difﬁcult to understand their afﬁni-
ties. For example, in one clade (Pararchaeniae) the
presence of peg teeth on the chelicerae and the unusual
shape of the carapace suggested an afﬁnity with the
palpimanoids, speciﬁcally Archaeidae and Mecysmau-
cheniidae (Forster and Platnick, 1984).
However,
molecular
sequencing
removed
para-
rchaeines from the Palpimanoidea and ﬁrmly placed it
with
the
araneoid
Malkaridae
(Forster,
1949;
Rix, 2006; Wood et al., 2012; Dimitrov et al., 2017).
Thus, Pararchaeinae is an example of convergence
with Mecysmaucheniidaes—both lineages have similar
morphologies in order to produce “trap-jaw” preda-
tory strikes with their highly manueverable chelicerae
(Kallal
et
al.,
2021b).
Recently
Hormiga
and
Scharff (2020) revised the non-pararchaeine malkarids
of New Zealand and proposed a phylogenetic hypothe-
sis for the family which now includes four subfamilies:
Malkarinae,
Pararchaeinae,
Tingotinginae
and
Sternoidinae.
Tetragnathidae is a relatively large family with 990
species classiﬁed in 45 genera distributed globally except
Antarctica (World Spider Catalog, 2023). The majority
construct typical orb webs similar to other orb-weaving
members of Araneoidea (e.g. Araneidae), yet their
webs
usually
have
open
hubs
(Alvarez-Padilla
&
Hormiga, 2011). Some have adopted a web-less, active
hunter or cursorial lifestyle (e.g. Berger et al., 2021).
Some tetragnathid genera such as Tetragnatha are
secondarily-haplogyne whereas most of them have ente-
legyne genitalia (Griswold et al., 1998; Alvarez-Padilla
& Hormiga, 2011). The taxonomy and systematics of
various tetragnathid groups has a convoluted history
(see Alvarez-Padilla and Hormiga, 2011), which has
now settled on grouping genera into four subfamilies,
namely
Tetragnathinae,
Nanometinae,
Metainae
and Leucauginae (Kallal et al., 2018; Alvarez-Padilla
et al., 2020; Ballesteros & Hormiga 2021).
Arkyidae is a relatively small family with two genera
and 38 species known from New Guinea, Australia and
New Caledonia (World Spider Catalog, 2023). They do
not construct foraging webs and instead are sit-and-wait
or ambush predators. Arkyids have a ﬁeld of short
dense macrosetae on the prolateral surface of the ﬁrst
tarsus in males and have enlarged aggregate gland
spigots on the posterior lateral spinnerets. This family
was recently elevated from subfamily Arkyinae (Aranei-
dae) to its own family by Dimitrov et al. (2017). Before
being in Araneidae, arkyids were placed in Thomisidae,
Mimetidae (which at the time was considered to be a
palpimanoid family based on the presence of cheliceral
peg teeth and gland mounds) and Tetragnathidae (For-
ster
&
Platnick,
1984;
reviewed
in
Framenau
et al., 2010).
Mimetidae is a family of araneophagic spiders,
which has earned them the name “pirate spiders”.
They include 159 species classiﬁed in eight genera
distributed globally except Antarctica (World Spider
Catalog, 2023). Similar to arkyids, they do not con-
struct any foraging web and instead have developed
a sophisticated method of aggressive mimicry for
hunting spiders in webs. They mimic the behaviour
of ensnared prey on the web of other spiders, or the
courtship vibrations of their prey’s conspeciﬁc male
by plucking on the web of their prey, to lure the
prey spider from their web and then attack and feed
on them (Cutler, 1972; Jackson & Whitehouse, 1986).
Mimetids
have
a
conspicuous
line
of
raptorial
macrosetae on the prolateral surfaces of the tibiae
and metatarsi of ﬁrst two legs (Platnick & Sha-
dab, 1993), which presumably assists in prey capture
(similar macrosetae are found in many malkarids).
The taxonomy and systematics of this family was
recently revised by Benavides et al. (2017) and Bena-
vides & Hormiga (2020).
Based on a highly supported clade including the fami-
lies Arkyidae, Mimetidae and Tetragnathidae, Hor-
miga (2017) named this grouping as “tetragnathoids”.
This clade is perhaps the only grouping within Araneoi-
dea that is robust to Sanger sequencing (Dimitrov
et al., 2017, Hormiga, 2017; Wheeler et al., 2017), tran-
scriptomes

Malkaridae has been recovered as a sister group
to the tetragnathoids using Sanger-sequencing data
(Dimitrov
et

Hormiga,
2017;
Wheeler
et al., 2017) and UCEs (Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021),
yet
transcriptomes
suggest
Mysmenidae
as
a
sister group to Malkaridae (Kallal et al., 2021a) or
Mysmenidae as a sister group to tetragnathoids (Gar-
rison et al., 2016, Fernandez et al., 2018a) (Fig. 11). In
Tetragnathidae, the Tetragnathinae, Metainae, Nano-
metinae and Leucauginae subfamilies were recovered
monophyletic using our combined dataset (Fig. 11a).
In Malkaridae, Pararchaeinae and Tingotinginae were
monophyletic, yet Sternoidinae and Malkarinae were
polyphyletic (Fig. 11b).
Araneidae + Synotaxidae
Araneidae is the second most speciose family within
Araneoidea (after Linyphiidae), with c. 3125 species
classiﬁed in 189 genera distributed worldwide (World
Spider Catalog, 2023) and the third most speciose fam-
ily (after Salticidae and Linyphiidae). Some of the
largest species and cosmopolitan web-building spider
genera such as Nephilengys and Nephila belong to this
family. Most araneids construct typical orb webs,
whereas some genera such as cyrtarachnines and mas-
tophorines
(also
known
as
bolas
spiders)
dispel
this phenomenon. Scharff & Coddington (1997) car-
ried out the ﬁrst large-scale cladistic analysis using
morphological and behavioural characters. Several of
the groups supported by that study continue to be rec-
ognized (such as gasteracanthines or cyrtophorines),
while others have been placed elsewhere, such as the
arkyines (“Arciinae”) which are now placed in their
own family, Arkyidae. Multiple molecular data classes
(six Sanger-sequenced markers, transcriptomes
and
UCEs) have consistently placed the lineage of Nephila
and
its
close
relatives
in
Araneidae
(Dimitrov
et
al.,
2012,
2017;
Scharff
et
al.,
2020;
Kallal
et al., 2021a; Kulkarni et al., 2021), where it is now
classiﬁed as a subfamily (Kallal et al., 2020). Although
recently Araneidae has been split into several families
(Kuntner et al. 2023), we reject such classiﬁcation as
premature in the absence of more thorough and exten-
sive phylogenetic hypothesis of the family. In this
study, we follow the classiﬁcation of Dimitrov et al.
(2017), Scharff et al. (2020) and Kallal et al. (2021a).
Synotaxidae was until recently a monogeneric family
with 11 species known from South America (World
Spider Catalog, 2023): Synotaxus species construct
“chicken-wire” shaped webs (Eberhard, 1977) and are
identiﬁable based on a stout patellar apophysis in the
male
palp
(Exline
&
Levi,
1965,
Santos
&
Rheims, 2005). Recent phylogenetic work (Ramırez
et al., 2022) has expanded the circumscription of Syno-
taxidae to include the genera Tekellina Levi, 1957 (for-
merly in Theridiidae) and Hamus Lin, Ballarin & Li,
Nescina Lin, Ballarin & Li, Gaucelmus Keyserling,
1884 (formerly in Nesticidae).
Our
UCE
phylogeny
using
maximum-likelihood
recovered Synotaxidae as the sister group to Aranei-
dae, similar to other UCE-based studies (Kulkarni
et al., 2020, 2021); however, with parsimony Synotaxi-
dae was a sister group to all Araneoidea families
except Theridiidae (Figs 4, 12, S3 and S4). Sanger-
based markers recover Theridiosomatidae + Synotaxi-
dae (Dimitrov et al., 2017) or Synotaxidae (Scharff
et al., 2020; Theridisomatidae not sampled) whereas
Theridiosomatidae is the sister group to Araneidae
with transcriptomes (Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kallal
et al., 2021a). Interestingly, UCEs extracted from tran-
scriptomes analysed as nucleotides recover Synotaxi-
dae
as
the
sister
group
to
Araneidae
(Kulkarni
et al., 2021). However, transcriptomic data analysed as
amino acids recover Theridiosomatidae or Synotaxi-
dae + Theridiosomatidae as the sister group to Aranei-
dae (Kulkarni et al., 2021: supplementary ﬁgures). No
morphological analysis has suggested close afﬁnities
between araneids and synotaxids and we do not know
of any morphological features that could be putative
synapomorphies of such a clade. In the Combined
phylogeny, we found that Synotaxidae (including Gau-
celmus as recently transferred by Ramırez et al., 2022)
are
nested
within
the
sister
clade
of
Araneidae
(Fig. 12a).
Nicodamoidea and Eresidae
Nicodamoidea clade includes the families Megadic-
tynidae and Nicodamidae, a superfamily rank that was
established by Dimitrov et al. (2017). Megadictynidae
are cribellate entelegyne spiders with two monotypic
genera (Megadictyna and Forstertyna), both from New
Zealand.
Nicodamidae includes ecribellate entelegyne spiders
with seven genera and 27 species distributed in Austra-
lia
and
New
Guinea
(Harvey,
1995;
Dimitrov
et al., 2017). The sister group to Nicodamoidea in our
phylogeny was Eresidae, which was recovered with
high support (100% UB; Figs 3, 4 and 13). This ﬁnd-
ing is consistent with other UCE-based phylogenies
(Kulkarni et al., 2020, 2021). However, this contrasts
with transcriptome-based phylogeny where the data
are treated as amino acids, Nicodamoidea is a sister
group to Araneoidea (Fernandez et al., 2018a; Kallal
et al., 2021a).
Eresidae (velvet spiders) includes nine genera of
which the genus Stegodyphus includes of three subsocial
species—S. sarasinorum (South Asia), and S. dumicola
and S. mimosarum (Africa) (Kraus & Kraus, 1988;
512

Johannesen et al., 2007). Stegodyphus constructs exten-
sive aerial cribellate sheet webs (Miller et al., 2010a).
The social species share building and maintaining
their webs, attack and capture prey together, and pro-
vide maternal care to the brood cooperatively (Kull-
mann, 1972; Agnarsson et al., 2006). Interestingly, the
close relatives of the social species of Eresidae are soli-
tary species. Sociality has been estimated to have
evolved
independently
about
18
times
in
spiders
(Agnarsson et al., 2006) in various families such as
Oxyopidae and Theridiidae. Recent studies have found
convergent expressions of certain gene families in the
social spider species (Tong et al., 2022). A stable place-
ment of Eresidae is thus important to understand the
evolution of social behaviour in spiders.
A phylogeny using ﬁve Sanger-sequencing markers
suggested Eresidae as a sister group to the UDOH
grade families Hersiliidae + Oecobiidae and the RTA
clade (Miller et al., 2010a). Eresidae is a sister group
to Nicodamoidea recovered with UCE data, but a sis-
ter group to the Araneoidea + Nicodamoidea clade
with
transcriptomes.
The
Sanger-based
six-marker
phylogeny of Wheeler et al. (2017) recovered Eresidae
as a sister group to the UDOH grade plus RTA clade,
similar to Miller et al. (2010a).
UDOH grade
UDOH grade is a paraphyletic assemblage (named
by Fernandez et al., 2018a) containing the spider
families Uloboridae, Deinopidae, Oecobiidae and Her-
siliidae. Uloboridae and Deinopidae are cribellate orb-
weaving groups, whereas all other orb-weaving spider
families are ecribellate and cluster into a monophyletic
group (Araneoidea). Uloboridae includes 19 genera
with 288 species with worldwide distribution. Typi-
cally, uloborids construct an orbicular web with radii,
frame threads and hub using nonsticky threads, and a
sticky spiral using cribellar silk. Some genera depart
from this behaviour, a few examples of which include
only spirals in Philoponella, (Opell & Eberhard, 1984),
a triangular orb web in Hyptiotes (Marples & Mar-
ples, 1937), and a single silk line of Miagrammopes
partially covered with cribellate silk and few additional
lines of support (Lubin et al., 1978). A recent study
demonstrated a catapult-like mechanism used by Hyp-
tiotes to capture prey. This spider stretches the web,
thereby storing elastic energy, by extending an addi-
tional anchor line and releases it on sensing contact of
prey with the web. The resulting jerk caused by the
release of stored energy entraps and wraps the prey
(Han et al., 2019). Deinopidae members are commonly
called “ogre-faced” spiders due to the large posterior
median eyes of some species. Deinopids have a unique
behaviour of waiting for prey hanging upside down
with a highly modiﬁed orbicular web held in anterior
legs. They cast the web towards the prey to capture it
(Robinson & Robinson, 1971) which has earned them
the name of “net casting” spiders. It includes 68
described species classiﬁed into three genera (Asiano-
pis,
Deinopis
and
Menneus)
distributed
worldwide
(World Spider Catalog, 2023). Oecobiidae includes six
genera represented by 120 species distributed globally,
with
some
widely
distributed
synanthropic
species
(Santos
&
Gonzaga,
2003;
World
Spider
Cata-
log, 2023). The small webs of Oecobius (used as a shel-
ter) are commonly seen in houses. Oecobiidae includes
taxa that are both cribellate (such as Oecobius) and
ecribellate (such as Uroctea) (Shear, 1970). Hersiliidae
includes 188 described species classiﬁed into 16 genera
with global distribution (World Spider Catalog, 2023).
Most hersiliids are arboreal, constructing their non-
foraging webs close to tree bark or wall surface on
which they move swiftly for prey capture or escaping.
Oecobiidae and Hersiliidae (together called “Oeco-
biioids” by Miller et al., 2010a) are characterized by a
unique prey attack behaviour of wrapping the prey by
circling around it (Crome, 1957; op. cit. after Lehti-
nen, 1967, p. 305; Coddington and Levi, 1991).
Resolving the relationships among the UDOH fami-
lies with their diverse foraging behaviour (with and
without web use) is crucial, as it affects the hypothesis
about the evolutionary history of the web architecture
and foraging behaviour in spiders. In our study, all
families of this group were monophyletic, including
Oecobiidae (represented by the cribellate Oecobius
and ecribellate Uroctea) in the combined phylogeny
(Fig.
13).
This
placement
is
different
from
the
prevailing
hypotheses,
as
described
below.
A
morphology-based cladogram recovered a monophy-
letic Deinopoidea which included Deinopidae and Ulo-
boridae;
however,
this
was
refuted
by
Sanger-
sequencing-based phylogenies (Dimitrov et al., 2012,
2017; Wheeler et al., 2017). The close relatives of the
UDOH families are the Tibial apophysis clade, consis-
tently recovered with the six Sanger-based markers,
transcriptomes
and
UCEs.

UCE phylogeny, Deinopidae was a sister group to
Hersiliidae + Oecobiidae clade. Some morphology-
based phylogenetic studies (for example, Griswold
et al., 1999) inferred Oecobiioidea as a sister group to
Eresidae (together called Eresoidea). In our study, the
Oecobiioidea + Deinopidae clade was a sister group to
a clade including Uloboridae + RTA + PT clade
(Figs 3, 4 and 13), similar to thephylogenetic hypothe-
sis of Wheeler et al. (2017).

The Tibial Apophysis clade
This large clade is united by the presence of a tibial
apophysis on the male pedipalp. At least two types of
tibial apophyses are known—dorsal and retrolateral.
Titanoecidae and Phyxelididae are early diverging fam-
ilies in this clade that have a dorsal tibial apophysis
(Griswold et al., 1999, 2005). Griswold et al. (1999)
removed the subfamily Phyxelidinae from Amaurobii-
dae and elevated it to family rank, and proposed the
informal
name
“Titanoecoidea”
for
grouping
the
families Phyxelididae and Titanoecidae clade based on
their cladistic analysis of morphological data. The
phyxelidid genus Vytfutia bears both types of tibial
apophyses (TA)—a dorsal and a retrolateral apophysis
on the male pedipalps—while the remaining phyxeli-
dids only have a retrolateral tibial apophysis (Griswold
et al., 2005); conjunction implies that these two tibial
apophyses
are
not
homologous.
In
Griswold
et al. (2012b), the single terminal of Vytfutia was sister
to Goeldia (Titanoecidae) plus Phyxelididae. Vytfutia
was not sampled in either Wheeler et al. (2017) or our
UCE sampling. With our current taxon sampling,
Titanoecoidea was not monophyletic; instead, Titanoe-
cidae was a sister group to the Phyxelididae + RTA
clade (Figs 3, 4 and 14). Synapomorphies of Phyxelidi-
dae include palpal femur thorns in both sexes, modi-
ﬁed male metatarsus I, and long, narrow, densely
placed
and
laterally
ﬂattened
paracribellar spigots
on the posterior median spinnerets (Griswold, 1990;
Griswold et al., 1999). It is noteworthy here that a ret-
rolateral
tibial
apophysis
also
is
present
in
the
other groups such as the linyphiid subfamily Erigoni-
nae,
suggesting
convergent
evolution
(Araneoidea)
(Hormiga, 1994b).
Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis (RTA) clade
As mentioned previously, the presence of a retrolat-
eral tibial apophysis on male pedipalp is characteristic
to
this
large
group
of
spiders
(Coddington
&
Levi, 1991; Griswold et al., 2005). Our UCE phylog-
eny recovered a highly supported RTA clade (100%
UB) (Figs 3 and 4). Two lineages, the Oval calamis-
trum clade and Dionycha (two-clawed spiders), make
up the bulk of species richness in the RTA clade.
These are mostly cursorial spiders including the com-
mon jumping spiders (Salticidae) which is the most
speciose spider family with more than 6700 species
belonging to the Dionycha clade (Figs 4 and 20). Most
of these RTA clade members with two-claws do not
construct foraging webs, but instead are active hunters
and their third middle claw has been replaced with
clusters of specialized adhesive setae, called scopulae,
that are positioned beneath the two superior claws.
The third tarsal claw is used by spiders to trace silk
lines on webs, but also is present in some spiders that
do not construct foraging webs (Ramırez, 2014). It has
been suggested that the scopulae have evolved as a
substitute for the use of silk for foraging, yet some
exceptions also exist (Wolff et al., 2013). For example,
most salticid spiders construct silk retreats and some
Lycosidae spiders construct webs, and both have adhe-
sive setae.
Zodariidae and Penestomidae
Penestomidae is a small family including one genus
(Penestomus) with nine species known from South
Africa, one of which also is recorded from Lesotho
(Miller et al., 2010b). Miller et al. (2010a) inferred that
Penestomidae nested within the RTA clade and based
on this placement they elevated this group to family
rank by removing it from a subfamily within Eresidae.
Before this, Lehtinen (1967) had shown that male penes-
tomids have an RTA which is typical of the RTA clade
member and not found in any eresid spider. Zodariids
are mostly nocturnal, ground-dwelling, wandering spi-
ders, many of which feed on ants. The synapomorphies
of this family are absence of serrula on the endites and a
rounded prolateral tibial process ﬁtting in a metatarsal
pouch (Jocque & Henrard, 2015).
In the UCE phylogeny, the Zodariidae + Penestomi-
dae clade is the sister group to the remaining RTA
clade families with high support (100% UB). The
monophyly of Zodariidae (two terminals) and Penesto-
midae (one terminal) was also highly supported in this
UCE tree (Fig. 4) as well as in the Combined phylog-
eny, with one terminal of Penestomidae and 27 termi-
nals
of
Zodariidae.
In
Miller
et
al.
(2010a),
Penestomidae (two Penestomus species) is the sister
group to Zodariidae (Zodarion and cf. Aschema).
A formal grouping called Zodarioidea, proposed by
Miller et al. (2010a), includes the families Homalony-
chidae, Penestomidae and Zodariidae was. However,
the Sanger-based phylogeny of Wheeler et al. (2017)
found this group to be polyphyletic. In their phylog-
eny, Homalonychidae was a sister group to the Oval
calamistrum + Dionycha clade. Wheeler et al. (2017)
point out that this grouping may be imposed by the
constraints of the backbone transcriptomic phylogeny
of Garrison et al. (2016) that they used. However,
multiple
transcriptomic
phylogenies
(Fernandez
et al., 2018a; Shao & Li, 2018; Kallal et al., 2021a)
and various other genomic data classes (UCEs, tran-
scriptomes
as
nucleotides,
amino
acids)
(Kulkarni
et al., 2021) have placed Homalonychidae as sister
group to the Oval calamistrum + Dionycha clade with
high support (UB >95%). This suggests that Zodarioi-
dea may need to be recircumscribed to only include
Zodariidae + Penestomidae; however, we do not for-
mally make any nomenclatural changes in this study.

Sparassidae
The members of this family with close to 1500 spe-
cies classiﬁed in 96 genera includes spiders with lateri-
grade legs (positioned similar to the legs of a crab)
(J€ager, 2001; World Spider Catalog, 2023) and ﬂeshy,
trilobate membranes at the distal region of the meta-
tarsi, an indented tip of the claw tuft setae, membra-
nous extensions of tarsi on the side of claw tuft plates,
and the trichobothrial setae lacking the bumps on their
bases (J€ager, 1998; Ramırez, 2014). These spiders are
cursorial hunters and some species can be quite large
(≤40 mm in body size), with very long legs. Our UCE
phylogeny placed Sparassidae as a sister group to the
marronoid clade with high support (100% UB; Figs 4
and 14), similar to the results of the previous tran-
scriptomic (Fernandez et al., 2018a; Shao & Li 2018;
Kallal et al., 2021a) and UCE (Kulkarni et al., 2021)
phylogenies. Morphological data suggest the place-
ment
of
Sparassidae
within
the
Dionycha
clade
(Ramırez, 2014), whereas Sanger-sequencing data sug-
gest multiple alternative placements (see Moradmand
et al., 2014; Wheeler et al., 2017). The subfamilies
Sparianthinae, Heteropodinae, Polybetinae and Delni-
nae were monophyletic whereas Eusparassinae was
paraphyletic (Fig. 14). A more recent and more com-
prehensive study reconstructed a sparassid phylogeny
using
four
Sanger-sequenced
markers
(Gorneau
et
al.,
2022)
and
recovered
similar
relationships
(including
paraphyly
of
Eusparassinae)
for
these
subfamilies.
Marronoid clade
The Marronoid clade groups several spider families
that are mostly brown coloured, without any promi-
nent colour pattern [Hormiga coined the informal
name of this clade, which was ﬁrst introduced in print
by Wheeler et al. (2017)]. Marronoids are one of the
major
taxonomic
problems
in
spider
classiﬁcation
because, as Lehtinen (1967) noted, there are many
closely related groups with and without a cribellum,
making it difﬁcult to group them and deﬁne diagnoses.
Marronoids include the families Amaurobiidae, Agele-
nidae, Hahniidae, Cybaeidae, Dictynidae, Toxopidae,
Cycloctenidae
and
Stiphiididae
(sensu
Wheeler
et al., 2017). Our UCE phylogeny recovered a mono-
phyletic assemblage of all the marronoid families with
high support (100% UB). All these families except
Hahniidae were monophyletic (Fig. 4). In the com-
bined phylogeny, Amaurobiidae, Cycloctenidae, Dicty-
nidae, Desidae, Hahniidae and Toxopidae were either
paraphyletic or polyphyletic (Figs 15 and 16); how-
ever, some alternative relationships were recovered
using the marronoid dataset (Fig. S5). We attempt to
delve further into the reasons for each of these rela-
tionships below.
Hahniidae
These small-sized spiders have a distinctly transverse
arrangement of the spinnerets in one row and an
advanced position of the tracheal spiracle (Lehti-
nen, 1967). Hahniids are represented by 357 described
species classiﬁed into 24 genera distributed worldwide
except Antarctica and Madagascar (World Spider Cat-
alog,
2023).
In
an
unpublished
dissertation,
Cat-
ley (1996) suggested that the position of tracheal
spiracles is highly variable among species, but instead
loss of true lateral tracheae may be a synapomorphy
of the family. Their linearly arranged spinnerets resem-
ble a comb and therefore they also are called “comb-
tailed spiders”. Hahniids live in the leaf litter or under
bark, where they construct small sheet webs. Lehti-
nen
(1967)
placed
Hahniidae
in
his
superfamily
Amaurobioidea (Miturgidae, Amaurobiidae, Liocrani-
dae,
Agelenidae
and
Dictynidae),
whereas
For-
ster (1970) considered it to be a member of the
superfamily
Dictynoidea
(Dictynidae,
Neolanidae,
Desidae,
Cybaeidae,
Argynonetidae
and
Anyphaenidae).
Our UCE phylogeny included three Hahniidae ter-
minals, two Cicurina and one Mastigusa species. The
inclusion of the six-marker dataset added another four
hahniid genera—Antistea, Cybaeolus, Hahnia (the type
genus) and Neoantistea. In both datasets, Hahniidae
was as polyphyletic. The Cicurina clade was recovered
as a sister group to Mastigusa + Cybaeidae II clade,
whereas
the
remaining
hahniids
including
Hahnia
formed a sister group to a larger clade including Toxo-
pidae, Dictynidae (excluding Lathys), Cybaeidae I &
II, Mastigusa and Cicurina. The monophyly of Hahnii-
dae I was strongly supported (100% UB; Fig. 15).
Interestingly,
the
marronoid
dataset
recovered
a
monophyletic Hahniidae except Mastigusa which was
a sister group to Cybaeidae (35% UB; Fig. S5).
Cybaeidae I and II formed a clade, yet a poorly sup-
ported branch of Ethobuella (Agelenidae) nested with
this clade (61% UB; Fig. S5). A recent study by Cas-
tellucci et al., (2023) based on Sanger sequencing data,
classiﬁed Mastigusa in the Cybaeidae, a placement that
is congruent with our results (Fig. 15).
In Wheeler et al. (2017), one terminal of Cicurina
was the sister group to Hahniidae (albeit with a moder-
ate support of 67% UB) and was formally moved from
Dictynidae to Hahniidae based on this phylogenetic
placement. It should be noted that Cicurina in the phy-
logeny of Spagna & Gillespie (2008) was a sister group
to Lathys (Dictynidae). In the phylogeny of entelegyne
spiders using Sanger-sequenced markers, Cicurina was

recovered as a sister group to Hahniidae (including
Hahnia) + Agelenidae clade (Miller et al., 2010a). The
Sanger-sequencing-based three-marker phylogeny of
Crews
et
al.
(2020)
also
recovered
Cicurina
not
nested within Hahniidae. The placement of remaining
Hahniidae also is poorly studied and is awaiting
revision.
Amaurobiidae
In these spiders, the median apophysis of the male
palp is a sclerotized plate-like structure (Paquin et al.,
2010). The monophyly and afﬁnities of amaurobiids
have a long and controversial history (see Lehti-
nen, 1967; Miller et al., 2010a, for details). In its current
circumscription, both cribellate (such as Amaurobius)
and ecribellate taxa (such as Macrobunus) are included.
In our UCE phylogeny, Amaurobiidae was polyphy-
letic. Amarobius and Callobius formed a clade which
was a sister group to the remaining marronoid families
whereas Rubrius antracticus was a sister group to a
clade including Toxopidae + Dictynidae + Hahniidae +
Cybaeidae families (Fig. 4). In our Combined phylog-
eny, a clade comprising Amaurobius, Callobius and
Pimus (Amaurobiidae I in Fig. 15) was a sister group to
the remaining marronoid families which included the
clade of other amaurobiid genera. The latter clade
(Amaurobiidae II in Figs 15 and S5) received high sup-
port
(96%
UB),
and
represents
the
subfamily
Macrobuninae.
Cycloctenidae
This family includes eight genera—six from New
Zealand, one both New Zealand and Australia and one
from Indonesia—totalling 80 described species (World
Spider Catalog, 2023). Forster (1979) extensively treated
the taxonomy of cycloctenids and provided a long list of
diagnostic characters, perhaps the most prominent
being the absence of claw tufts and scopulae.
In the UCE phylogeny,
Cycloctenus (the single
cycloctenid terminal included) was the sister group to
the clade including Stiphiididae + Desidae (Fig. 4).
Our Combined dataset included ﬁve cycloctenid gen-
era, each with one species of Orepukia, Pakeha, Para-
voca, Toxopsiella and ﬁve species of Cycloctenus. In
the resulting phylogeny from this dataset, Orepukia
and Pakeha formed a clade that was a sister group to
Aorangia
(Stiphidiidae)
(Fig.
16).
The
remaining
Cycloctenidae terminals formed a sister group to a
clade
that
included
the
Aorangia
(Stiphiididae) + Orepukia and Pakeha clade (Fig. 16).
In
the
phylogeny
of
Wheeler
et
al.
(2017),
the
Orepukia + Pakeha
clade
was
a
sister
group
to
the remaining cycloctenids with poor support (61%
UB).
Based
on
this
phylogenetic
placement
both
Orepukia and Pakeha were transferred, from Ageleni-
dae and Amaurobiidae respectively, to Cycloctenidae
by Wheeler et al. (2017). This placement of a mono-
phyletic Cycloctenidae was recovered by our marro-
noid dataset (Fig. S5).
Dictynidae
Dictynidae includes spiders occupying diverse habi-
tats such as dry, arid and even aquatic, semi-aquatic,
seashore, freshwater and salt-ﬂat (Spagna et al., 2010).
It includes the aquatic spider Argyroneta aquatica,
which constructs a silk-tube (called “diving bell”)
among aquatic vegetation and resurfaces periodically
to capture an air bubble around its opisthosoma.
Dictynidae includes c. 474 described species classiﬁed
in 53 genera distributed worldwide except Antarctica
(World Spider Catalog, 2023). In its current circum-
scription, both cribellate and ecribellate species are
included in Dictynidae. The cribellate dictynids formed
a clade in some analyses (Griswold et al., 2005), yet the
family is rendered polyphyletic when the ecribellate
members are included (Spagna et al., 2010).
Lathys, which is currently placed in Dictynidae, was
recovered as a sister group to Agelenidae, albeit with
poor support (15% UB), and the other dictynids
formed a clade which was sister group to Toxopidae
(Fig. 15). Our marronoid dataset recovered Lathys as
a sister group to the Toxopidae + Dictynidae clade
(Fig.
S5).
Multiple
alternative
placements
of
Lathys, such as a sister group to Cheiracanthium
(Cheiracanthiidae), were recovered using single and
combined Sanger-sequencing-based trees (see Spagna
et al., 2010). In Wheeler et al. (2017), Lathys was a sis-
ter to the remaining Dictynidae with low support
(11% UB). The Sanger-sequencing-based phylogenies
of Spagna & Gillespie (2008) and Miller et al. (2010a)
recovered a polyphyletic Dictynidae with Lathys as a
sister group to Cicurina (currently placed in Hahnii-
dae) and the remaining Dictynidae formed a clade.
Lehtinen (1967) had already stated that Cybaeidae and
Cicurininae (both were subfamilies within Dictynidae
at the time) “perhaps they could be united in a single,
monophyletic family”.
Desidae
Desidae includes about 325 species classiﬁed in 63
genera with most species in Australia, New Zealand,
and New Caledonia, and some species in south-east
Asia and Africa (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Desi-
dae has both cribellate and ecribellate species. Some
desids (whose natural history is known), such as Cam-
bridgea from New Zealand, construct a large sheet
web with a tube-like retreat (Forster & Forster, 1999).
Desis live inside silken retreats and inhabit intertidal

zones, for example hiding inside barnacles or among
kelp, and for that reason are also known as “intertidal
spiders” (Baehr et al., 2017). Desidae was monophy-
letic in all datasets including the UCE, Combined and
marronoid datasets (Figs 4, 15 and S5).
Toxopidae
Toxopidae includes more than 80 species classiﬁed
in 14 genera, distributed in New Zealand and Austra-
lia, and some islands in the Southern Hemisphere such
as Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Islands (World Spider
Catalog, 2023). In our UCE phylogeny, the single ter-
minal of this family (Midgee sp.) formed a sister group
to Dictynidae (Fig. 4). In the Combined and marro-
noid phylogeny, with nine genera (ten terminals), Tox-
opidae was monophyletic and formed a sister group to
Dictynidae (excluding Lathys) (Figs 15 and S5).
Homalonychidae
Homalonychus,
the
single
genus
of
this
family,
includes only two species, both known from the south-
ern United States and northern Mexico. Homalonychids
are wandering spiders that live in the desert where they
can throw sand on their body to bury themselves, which
is hypothesized to be a defensive behaviour (Domınguez
& Jimenez, 2005). This family was monophyletic (both
species of Homalonychus sampled in the Combined
dataset) and was recovered as a sister group to the clade
including Oval
Calamistrum
and
Dionycha
clades
(Figs 3, 4 and 17), similar to the ﬁndings of Wheeler
et al. (2017), Fernandez et al. (2018a), Kulkarni
et al. (2021) and Kallal et al. (2021a).
Oval calamistrum (OC) clade
The Oval calamistrum (OC) clade was described by
Polotow et al. (2015) and includes spiders with a cala-
mistrum with several rows of setae. In our UCE phy-
logeny, the Uliodon (Zoropsidae) + Udubidae clade
formed
a
sister
lineage
to
the
remaining
OC
clade taxa. The other zoropsid in our UCE analysis,
Tengella, was a sister group to the lycosoid families
(Fig. 4). In the Combined phylogeny, two groupings
of Zoropsidae were recovered (polyphyletic), one of
which was a sister group to (Udubidae) and the
other one was a sister group to the lycosoid families
similar to the UCE phylogeny (Fig. 17). As Wheeler
et al. (2017) stated, the placement of Zoropsidae is
unstable and requires further attention.
Ctenidae
This family includes about 600 species classiﬁed
in 49 genera distributed on all continents except
Antarctica (World Spider Catalog, 2023). They are
nocturnal, wandering spiders and are mostly ground-
dwelling, with a few arboreal species (Polotow &
Brescovit, 2008). Members of this family have a typi-
cal “ctenid eye pattern” of 2-4-2 eyes arranged in
three rows of which anterior lateral eyes are smallest.
The “ctenid eye pattern” has evolved convergently
seven times in the RTA clade (Griswold, 1993; Hazzi
& Hormiga, 2023). Most ctenids are ecribellate, but
some genera such as Acanthoctenus have retained the
cribellum (Griswold et al., 2005). Additional diagnos-
tic characters of the family are eyes with a grate-
shaped tapetum, teeth on the fang furrow and chelic-
erae with a boss (Griswold et al., 2005). The highly
venomous and medically important spiders of the
genus Phoneutria belong to this family (Lucas, 1988;
Foelix, 2010).
In the morphological phylogeny of Silva-Davila
(2003), Ctenidae was monophyletic and a sister group
to Miturgidae. In a more recent morphological study,
Polotow & Brescovit (2014) recovered a monophyletic
Ctenidae. However, only two outgroups (Zoropsis and
Tengella, both Zoropsidae) were used in the latter
study, so its close relatives in the RTA clade could not
be identiﬁed. Recently, Hazzi & Hormiga (2023) pub-
lished the most comprehensive phylogeny of Ctenidae
representing 28 of the current 49 described genera,
using nine Sanger-sequenced markers where the family
was monophyletic. In our UCE phylogeny, Ctenidae
was monophyletic (Fig. 4) and was a sister group to
Psechridae similar to the transcriptomic phylogeny of
Cheng & Piel (2018). In the combined phylogeny, how-
ever, Ancylometes (not sampled in UCE phylogeny)
was recovered as a sister group to all lycosoid families
with moderate support (93% UB; Fig. 17a), a ﬁnding
that is similar to Wheeler et al. (2017). In the phylog-
eny of Piacentini and Ramırez (2019), Ancylometes
was a sister terminal to Oxyopidae with poor support
(39% posterior probability; see supplementary tree of
Piacentini and Ramırez, 2019). The placement of
Ancylometes varied across analyses in Hazzi & Hor-
miga (2023) including a placement as sister to Oxyopi-
dae. The current taxonomic placement of Anyclometes
within Ctenidae is unusual because it is the only group
within ctenids that constructs a nursery web (Mer-
ret, 1988; Santos, 2007), a behaviour that is found pri-
marily in Pisauridae. Another nursery web-building
spider outside Pisauridae is Cupiennius. It was recently
transferred from Ctenidae to Trechaleidae by Piacen-
tini & Ramırez (2019) based on its highly supported
phylogenetic placement. Our UCE phylogeny also
recovered
Cupiennius
nested
within
Trechaleidae
(Fig. 4). Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis based
solely on the CO1 marker recovered both non-pisaurid
nursery web-building spiders Anyclometes and Cupien-
nius in a clade (Gamez Vargas, 2019).

Thomisidae
Spiders of this family are called “crab spiders”
owing to the laterigrade orientation of their legs, their
posture superﬁcially resembling that of a crab. Thomi-
sidae includes >2100 species classiﬁed in 171 genera
distributed globally (World Spider Catalog, 2023).
They are sit-and-wait predators and do not construct
foraging webs. Many species have cryptic body colora-
tion and can even change the body colour (Wei-
gel, 1941). Some thomisids can mimic twigs (e.g.
Tmarus), ants (e.g. Aphantochilus) or bird droppings
(e.g. Phrynarachne) (Benjamin et al., 2008; Benja-
min, 2011; Teixeira et al., 2013; Ileperuma-Arachchi
and Benjamin, 2019).
Thomisidae was recovered as polyphyletic with one
clade of most thomisid representatives (45 terminals),
including the type genus Thomisus, as a sister group to
Oxyopidae in our Combined phylogeny (Fig. 17a).
The other clade included Borboropactus, which was the
sister group to Psechridae, albeit with moderate sup-
port (56% UB; Fig. 17b).
Borboropactus is unusual because it has a canoe-
shaped tapetum, whereas all other thomisid genera have
a
grate-shaped
tapetum
(Homann,
1934;
Benja-
min, 2011). This genus is one of the few thomisid genera
found fossilized in the amber (Wunderlich, 2004). Bor-
boropactus has a characteristic behaviour of digging and
covering itself with soil particles. A similar behaviour is
found
in
Stephanophis
(Thomisidae),
Cryptothele
(Zodariidae), Sicarius (Sicariidae) and even some myga-
lomorphs such as Paratropis (Paratropidae). Based on
this unusual behaviour, in addition to some morpholog-
ical characters, Wunderlich (2004) erected a new family
(Borboropactidae) to accommodate extant and fossil
Borboropactus species. Benjamin et al. (2008) used three
Sanger-sequencing-based markers and found that Bor-
boropactus is sister group to the remaining Thomisidae
and, thus, rejected Borboropactidae, which was synony-
mized with Thomisidae. Morphology recovered Borbor-
opactus
nested
within
the
Stephanopis
clade
(Benjamin, 2011). In Wheeler et al. (2017), Borboropac-
tus was the sister group to remaining thomisids with
poor support (35% UB). In some of the Wheeler et al.
2017) analyses Borboropactus did not nest within Tho-
misidae, and the authors preferred “to keep the more
traditional Thomisidae sensu lato with weak support”
noting that their results were “also compatible with the
split of a robust Thomisidae sensu stricto and a separate
Borboropactidae as proposed by Wunderlich (2004).”
Pisauridae and Dolomedes
Pisauridae includes about 360 species classiﬁed in 52
genera
distributed
globally
(World
Spider
Cata-
log, 2023). Many pisaurids show a peculiar courtship
behaviour which involves a “nuptial gift” consisting of
a prey wrapped in silk as studied in Pisaurina mirabilis
(Clerck, 1757). If a female accepts the prey, it means
that she is receptive for mating (van Hasselt, 1884;
Stalhandske, 2001). A similar behaviour has been
observed in some spiders of the family Trechaleidae
(Costa-Schmidt et al., 2008). Female pisaurids con-
struct a tent-like silk structure when the spiderlings are
about to emerge from the egg sacs. This web is called
a “nursery web” and is a synapomorphy of Pisauridae
(Piacentini & Ramırez, 2019). Similar nursery webs
have convergently evolved in other spiders such as
Peucetia (Oxyopidae), Cupiennius (Trechaleidae) and
Ancylometes (Ctenidae) (Merret, 1988; Sierwald, 1997;
Piacentini & Ramırez, 2019).
In our UCE phylogeny, Pisauridae was paraphyletic,
with most of Pisauridae (in part) as sister group to a
clade that includes Dolomedes (Pisauridae) and the Tre-
chaleidae + Lycosidae clade (Fig. 4). In the combined
phylogeny, Dolomedes (four terminals) + Bradystichus
were the sister group to a clade that included Trechalei-
dae
and
Lycosidae
(Figs
17
and
18).
Wheeler
et al. (2017) and Piacentini & Ramırez (2019) recovered
the Dolomedes + Bradystichus clade as sister to the
remaining Pisauridae clade. Likewise, the eight-marker
phylogeny of Albo et al. (2017) also recovered Dolo-
medes not nesting within Pisauridae. However, the tran-
scriptomic analysis of Fernandez et al. (2018a), Cheng
& Piel (2018) and Kallal et al. (2021a) recovered a
monophyletic Pisauridae with Dolomedes as a sister
group to the remaining Pisauridae.
Lycosidae and Trechaleidae
Lycosidae are a large family including close to 2500
species classiﬁed in 132 genera and distributed globally
(World Spider Catalog, 2023). Lycosids are wandering,
agile hunters that chase their prey, earning them the
vernacular name of “wolf spiders”. Most lycosids do
not construct foraging webs and some, such as Geoly-
cosa, dig and live in burrows (Marshall, 1995). Lycosid
females carry their egg sac attached to their spinnerets
and on hatching, the spiderlings move to the mother’s
abdomen and are carried by her, where they cling to
modiﬁed abdominal setae. The lycosid genus Schizo-
cosa has been extensively studied for visual and vibra-
tory signalling during courtship. Male Schizocosa use
their tibial bristles and dark pigmentation on ﬁrst legs
for visual display. They also use vibrational signals by
stridulating, drumming of pedipalps or even bouncing
their
body
(Hebets
et
al.,
1996;
Stratton,
2005).
Although the family Lycosidae is nested in the RTA
clade, lycosid males lack a retrolateral tibial apophysis
(Polotow et al., 2015; Poy et al., 2020).
Trechaleidae is a relatively small family with 133
species classiﬁed in 17 genera, distributed in Central

and South America and one species in Japan (World
Spider Catalog, 2023). Most trechaleids live close to
water bodies and have long and ﬂexible tarsi, a charac-
ter which is hypothesized to be an adaptation for
walking on the water surface (da Silva et al., 2008).
Lycosidae was recovered as the sister group to Trecha-
leidae in the UCE phylogeny (Fig. 4), similar to the results
from Sanger-sequencing analyses (Albo et al., 2017;
Wheeler et al., 2017; Piacentini & Ramırez, 2019), yet both
families were polyphyletic in the Combined phylogeny
(Fig. 18). We integrated Piacentini & Ramırez (2019)’s
and Wheeler et al. (2017)’s Lycosidae sequences to assess
if increased taxon sampling rendered monophyly of these
families. However, the trechaleid Trechalea (one terminal)
formed a sister group to a clade that included Cupiennius
(two terminals), Arctosa kwangreungensis Paik & Tanaka,
1986 and Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata (Ohlert, 1865) (Lyco-
sidae I) and the remaining Lycosidae. The Lycosidae I
branch was moderately supported (79% UB) in its place-
ment as a sister group to the Cupiennius clade (Fig. 18).
The remaining Lycosidae (Lycosidae II) placed as sister
clade to this includes Lycosidae 98 terminals. In the
Sanger-sequencing-based
phylogeny
of
Piacentini
&
Ramırez (2019), A. kwangreungensis did not nest with
other Arctosa species, but instead was a sister group to
Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata and Melocosa fumosa (latter
nesting within Lycosidae in this study, see Fig. 18).
Dolejs (2013) suggested that Arctosa fujiii Tanaka,
1985,
(closely
related
to
A. kwangreungensis),
H. rubrofasciata and Hygrolycosa umidicola Tanaka,
1978 use an empty egg sac to carry their spiderlings.
This
behaviour
is
characteristic
of
Trechaleidae,
whereas most lycosids carry spiderlings on their abdo-
men. Furthermore, Dolejs (2013) suggests that A.
kwangreungensis and Arctosa ebicha Yaginuma, 1960
(both from China and Korea) do not belong to Arc-
tosa, but may be an undescribed genus. Interestingly,
A. ebicha nested within Lycosidae in our Combined
phylogeny (Fig. 18). The inclusion of A. fujiii and
A. hikosanensis in our Combined dataset will be useful
to further investigate the placement of this group.
Dionycha
Dionychans are characterized by having a reduced
or secondarily lost third claw in their leg tarsi (Cod-
dington & Levi, 1991; Ramırez, 2014). They represent
c. 30% of all described spider species classiﬁed into 19
families (World Spider Catalog, 2023). There are, how-
ever, other spider families such as some Dysderidae,
Palpimanidae and Ctenidae, which also have conver-
gently evolved the two-claw condition (Ramırez, 2014).
Dionychans were monophyletic with high support in
both the UCE phylogeny and the Combined phylog-
eny (both with 100% UB). The Dionycha clade is
divided into three subclades: Prodidomidae, Dionycha
A and Dionycha B. Dionycha A clade is supported by
one unambiguous synapomorphy: the cylindrical gland
spigots (Cy) on the posterior median spinnerets are
clustered
posteriorly
and
isolated
from
the
other
spigots (Azevedo et al., 2022).
Prodidomidae
This family was recently restored from a subfamily
within Gnaphosidae by Azevedo et al. (2022) and cur-
rently includes 192 species classiﬁed in 23 genera
(World Spider Catalog, 2023). This family is united by
the shaft of the minor ampullate gland spigots being
reduced to a needle-like extension of the base (Plat-
nick, 1990). A morphological cladistic analysis by
Rodrigues & Rheims (2020) recovered Prodidominae
(sensu Rodrigues and Rheims, 2020) as a sister group
to Molycriinae (Gnaphosidae). However, our UCE
and Combined phylogeny recovered Prodidomidae as
a sister group to remaining Dionycha (Figs 4, 19 and
S6), similar to the results of Azevedo et al. (2022).
Trachycosmidae
This
family
was
recently
elevated
by
Azevedo
et al. (2022) to circumscribe the Australian genera for-
merly placed in Gallieniellidae (Meedo, Neato, Oreo,
Peeto and Questo) based on the phylogenetic place-
ment recovered from a Combined dataset of UCEs,
Sanger-sequenced markers and phenotypic data. In
our UCE, Combined and Dionychan phylogenies, Tra-
chycosmidae was monophyletic (Figs 4, 19 and S6),
with the exception of Tinytrema which was placed as
the sister group to Trachelidae (in part) or Gnaphosi-
dae (in part). Tinytrema was placed in a similar way in
Wheeler et al.’s (2017) analysis, but was not sampled
in the more rigorous analysis of Azevedo et al. (2022).
Azevedo et al. (2022) provided the following diagno-
sis for Trachycosmidae: anterior lateral spinnerets with
a complete distal article and lacking inﬂatable area,
separated by their diameter or more; the presence of
two major ampullate gland spigots in males and
females; epigynal ﬁeld formed by an undivided plate,
usually with an atrium at the copulatory openings; lens
of the anterior lateral eyes are convex, juxtaposed
from surrounding cuticle (compared to ﬂat lens of
Trochanteriidae).
Clubionidae
This family includes more than 650 species classiﬁed
in 18 genera. In our UCE, Combined and Dionychan
phylogenies, Clubionidae was polyphyletic with Elaver
as a sister group to Anyphaenidae and this clade as
the sister group to the remaining Clubionidae (Figs 4,
19
and
S6).

Ramırez (2014), Clubiona and Elaver formed a clade
which represent the loss of the
cylindrical gland
spigots. Anyphaenidae and Clubionidae are closely
related families (Platnick, 1974), so the placement of
Elaver
recovered
in
our
study
is
perhaps
not
surprising.
[Correction added on 31 October 2023, after ﬁrst
online publication: The last sentence has been deleted
in this paragraph.]
Anyphaenidae
This family includes c. 635 species classiﬁed in 58
genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Anyphaenids
have an advanced tracheal spiracle and their large and
complex tracheal system extends into the prosoma
and legs (Platnick, 1974; Ramırez, 2014). The morpho-
logical cladogram of Ramırez (2014) included four
genera, Amaurobioides, Gayenna, Xiruana and Any-
phaena, which formed a clade. Our UCE and Com-
bined
phylogenies
recovered
a
monophyletic
Anyphaenidae (Figs 4 and 19). In the Combined phy-
logeny, Corinnomma cf. severum (Corinnidae) nested
with Anyphaenidae, albeit with poor support (59%
UB). However, with the Dionychan dataset, Corin-
nomma cf. severum nested within Corinnidae, rendering
Anyphaenidae monophyletic (Fig. S6).
Gnaphosidae
This is a large family of ground spiders with >2445
species classiﬁed in 147 genera and distributed glob-
ally. Gnaphosids are easily identiﬁed by the enlarged,
cylindrical, widely separated anterior lateral spinnerets
(Murphy, 2007). Many gnaphosids have enlarged piri-
form gland spigots of anterior lateral spinnerets com-
pared
to
the
major
ampullate
gland
spigots
(Platnick, 1990). In the gnaphosid subfamily Molycrii-
nae, the anterior lateral spinnerets are extremely elon-
gated and placed further anteriorly near middle of the
abdomen, away from the remaining spinnerets (Plat-
nick & Baehr, 2006). This conﬁguration of spinnerets
is hypothesized to be an adaptation for efﬁcient use of
piriform silk in prey capture (Wolff et al., 2017).
Another
well-studied
gnaphosid,
Micaria
sociabilis
Kulczynski, 1897 mimics the arboreal Liometopum
microcephalum (Panzer, 1798) ants using kairomones
(a chemical substance produced by Liometopum and
detected by Micaria) (Pekar, 2020). The same species
also shows reverse cannibalism where male spiders
cannibalized older female spiders and showed prefer-
ence for young females for mating (Sentenska &
Pekar 2013). Another gnaphosid, Drassodes cupreus
(Blackwall, 1834), is known to track polarized light as
a compass using its posterior median eyes to navigate
to its retreat after foraging trips (Dacke et al., 1999,
2001).
In our UCE phylogeny, one terminal of Lampona
(Lamponidae) nested within a clade of four terminals
that included three Gnaphosidae taxa (Fig. 4). In the
Combined and Dionychan phylogenies Gnaphosidae
are polyphyletic, although with poor support (<95%
UB) (Figs 19, 20 and S6). Recent phylogenetic studies
using molecular data focused on systematics of Gna-
phosidae also obtained this family as polyphyletic
(Azevedo et al., 2018; Rodrigues & Rheims, 2020).
Our study recovered relationships similar to the study
of Wheeler et al. (2017) because 14 of 16 taxa repre-
senting this family contained six markers, two taxa
included UCEs and one with both data.
Lamponidae
This family includes close to 200 species classiﬁed in
23 genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023) characterized
by
unisegmented
anterior
lateral
spinnerets
(Plat-
nick, 2000). The ﬁrst cladistic based classiﬁcation of
Lamponidae was proposed by Platnick (2000) using
several generic representations, and recovered Lam-
pona, Centrothele and Asadipus nested within the fam-
ily.
Ramırez
(2014)
revised
some
characters
and
Centrothele and Lampona to be monophyletic. The
molecular phylogeny of Wheeler et al. (2017) recovered
a polyphyletic Lamponidae similar to the most recent
study of Azevedo et al. (2022). However, in our UCE
phylogeny rendered a polyphyletic Lamponidae with a
clade including Lampona (type genus) as a sister group
to Anzacia (Gnaphosidae) and Centrothele nardi (Lam-
ponidae) as a sister group to other Gnaphosidae
(Fig. 4). Likewsie, in our Combined phylogeny, the
Centrothele (two terminals) clade was a sister group to
Trachycosmidae II, whereas Lampona (type genus)
were a sister group to Anzacia (Fig. 19, but see
Fig. S6). Azevedo et al. (2022) recently pointed out
that Anzacia (SRR6997629) may be a lamponid, but
requires examination of the vouchers. The systematics
of Lamponidae needs revision and it is possible that a
rapid radiation of Lamponidae and Gnaphosidae is
rendering noise in the phylogenetic signal (Azevedo
et al., 2022).
Trochanteriidae
This is a small family with about 50 species classiﬁed
in six genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). These spi-
ders have a ﬂattened body and laterigrade legs with
greatly elongated posterior trochanters. In our Com-
bined and Dionychan phylogenies, this family was
polyphyletic with one clade including Hemicloea (three
terminals) sister group to Intruda (Gnaphosidae), and

the other clade including Doliomalus and Vectius (one
terminal each) (Fig. 19).
Trachelidae
This family includes clc. 265 species classiﬁed in 20
genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Ramırez (2014)
provided a diagnosis for this family as follows: claw
tufts made of heavily folded setae, a claw tuft clasper
and reduce leg spination on posterior legs and, dor-
sally on all femora and lacking median apophysis simi-
lar to Phrurolithidae, but distinguished by the absence
of ventral distal hook on the male palpal femur. In
our UCE phylogeny, Trachelidae was monophyletic
(Fig. 4), yet in the Combined phylogeny it was
polyphyletic with two terminals of Orthobula sister to
Tinytrema (Trachycosmidae) (Fig. 19). Interestingly,
our Dionychan phylogeny recovered a monophyletic
Trachelidae (Fig. S6). In the UCE phylogeny of Aze-
vedo et al. (2022), Trachelidae was a sister group to
Phrurolithidae, yet addition of legacy markers data
and phenotypic data refuted this placement.
Gallieniellidae
This is a relatively small family with 41 species classi-
ﬁed in ﬁve genera that are distributed in the Southern
hemisphere, Argentina (Galianoella), South Africa (Aus-
trachelas,
Drassodella),
Madagascar
(Gallieniella,
Legendrena)
and
the
Comoros
(Gallieniella).
Plat-
nick (1984) diagnosed the family based on sclerotized
anterior spinnerets, obliquely depressed endites, and
ﬂattened oval posterior median eyes.
Gallieniellids were represented by ﬁve terminals in
our UCE phylogeny which recovered a polyphyletic
Trachelidae (Fig. 4). In the Combined and Dionychan
phylogenies, the increment of three taxa recovered a
clade including Gallieniella and Legendrena (Figs 19
and
S6).
Cladograms
in
Platnick
(2002),
Ramırez (2014) and Azevedo et al. (2022) included
some gallieniellid genera. In the latter study, this fam-
ily was a sister group to Phrurolithidae. In our com-
bined phylogeny, Galianoella was recovered as a sister
group to Drassinella (Liocranidae), Drassodella as a
sister branch of Hypodrassodes (Gnaphosidae) and
Austrachelas
of
Hesperocranum
(Liocranidae).
The
remaining
gallieniellids
formed
a
sister
group
to
Trochanteriidae.
Liocranidae
This family includes c. 340 species classiﬁed in 35
genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Lehtinen (1967)
stated that the presence of a secondary conductor in
the male palpus is the key characteristic of Liocrani-
dae. The cladistic analysis of Ramırez (2014) recovered
a polyphyletic Liocranidae. In all of our phylogenetic
analyses, this family was polyphyletic, also similar to
Wheeler et al. (2017). The type genus representative
Liocranum was a sister group to Cithaeronidae (Figs 4,
19 and S6). Although the preferred hypothesis of Aze-
vedo et al. (2022) recovered a monophyletic Liocrani-
dae, although they state that another analysis suggests
that nonmonophyly of this family is equally likely. We
recovered
a
monophyletic
Teutamus
group
(sensu
Ramırez, 2014) which was represented by Teutamus
and Sesieutes in our Combined and Dionycha datasets
(Figs 19 and S6).
Phrurolithidae
This family includes c. 366 species classiﬁed in 24
genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Ramırez (2014)
diagnosed this family as follows: claw tufts made of
heavily folded setae, a claw tuft clasper and reduce leg
spination on posterior legs and, dorsally on all femora
and lacking median apophysis similar to Trachelidae,
but distinguished by modiﬁcations on the ventral
median apophysis and usually a ventral apical hook, a
globose receptacle on the epigynum, in addition to the
primary and secondary spermathecae. Our UCE phy-
logeny recovered a monophyletic Phrurolithidae as a
sister group to Xenoplectus (Liocranidae) (Fig. 4), yet
addition of Otacilia in the Combined phylogeny recov-
ered a polyphyletic placement (Fig. 19). Interestingly,
the
Dionychan
dataset
recovered
a
monophyletic
Phrurolithidae (Fig. S6). The taxon sample of Azevedo
et al. (2022) was similar to our UCE dataset and they
recovered a monophyletic Phrurolithidae as a sister
group to Trachelidae; however, the placement was not
robust to addition of legacy marker or phenotypic
dataset.
Xenoctenidae
This is a relatively small family with 33 species clas-
siﬁed in four genera distributed mostly in South Amer-
ica and Australia (World Spider Catalog, 2023). The
cladistic analysis of Silva-Davila (2003) recovered a
monophyletic group consisting of Odo and Xenoctenus.
Ramırez (2014) obtained an addition of Paravulsor in
this clade which he called the Xenoctenus group. This
group was established formally as a family by Ramırez
& Silva-Davila (2017) in the Wheeler et al. (2017)
study. Xenoctenids are diagnosed as being similar to
viridasiids and some miturgids owing to two recurved
eye rows with grate-shaped tapetum, two claws and
well-developed scopulae and claw tufts in some spi-
ders. It is distinguishable by the distal divide in the
tegulum in the region where the embolus emerges
(Wheeler et al., 2017). In all of our analyses, Xenocte-
nidae was monophyletic (Figs 4, 20 and S6), yet the

placement of Miturgidae as its sister group, as in Aze-
vedo et al. (2022), was never recovered.
Philodromidae
Commonly called as running crab spiders, this fam-
ily includes more than 500 species classiﬁed in 29 gen-
era (World Spider Catalog, 2023). These spiders lack
tapeta on the anterior lateral and the posterior eyes
(Azevedo et al., 2022). The ﬁrst cladistic analysis of
Philodromidae by Muster (2009) recovered the family
monophyletic. Ramırez (2014) inferred that the claw
tuft of tenent setae in the male and female pedipalps
as an unambiguous synapomorphy of Philodromidae.
In all of our datasets, Philodromidae was a sister
group to Salticidae (Figs 4, 20 and S6) similar to
Wheeler et al. (2017) and Azevedo et al. (2022). This is
one of the most robustly supported grouping by
molecular data among the Dionychan spider families.
Salticidae
Salticids (jumping spiders) are the largest family of
spiders comprising close to 6600 species (c. 12% of all
described spiders) classiﬁed in 674 genera distributed
globally (World Spider Catalog, 2023). They are easily
recognizable by their large anterior median eyes, which
likely contribute to their documented ability to learn
and solve problems (Jackson, 2002). A great diversity
of biological features has been documented for jumping
spiders,
including
courtship,
foraging
behaviours,
extreme sexual dimorphism and aggressive mimicry
(reviewed in Richman & Jackson, 1992). Salticidae
includes some highly specialized species, such as ant
mimics (Ceccarelli & Crozier, 2007), specialists of other
spiders, like Portia (Jackson & Wilcox, 1998), and even
specialization on mosquitoes that have recently had a
blood meal (Jackson & Cross, 2015). An examplar of
their charismatic courtship behaviours, peacock spider,
genus Maratus, males have brightly coloured abdomens
that enlarge during courtship, and they combine vibra-
tional cues with the visual cues from the abdomen dur-
ing courtship (Girard et al., 2011).
In our UCE and Combined phylogenies with 31 and
54 taxa, respectively (Figs 4 and 20), this family was
monophyletic, which has been supported by all previ-
ous molecular analyses (e.g. Maddison & Hedin, 2003;
Maddison et al., 2014, 2017; Maddison, 2015).
Maddison et al. (2017) provided the most updated
phylogenetic hypothesis of salticid relationships using
anchored hybrid enrichment data. They recovered the
Asemoneinae + Lyssomaninae clade as the sister group
to remaining salticids, similar to our study (Fig. 20).
The internal relationships within Salticinae varied in
comparison with Maddison et al. (2017), but it could
be attributed to the difference with the taxon sampling
in both studies. The baviines were monophyletic in our
study similar to Maddison et al. (2020).
Corinnidae
This family includes about 850 species classiﬁed in
76 genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). In all of our
datasets, this family was polyphyletic. In the Dionycha
and Combined phylogenies, the “Pronophaea group”
(sensu Wheeler et al. 2017) was recovered as a sister
group of a clade including Viridasiidae, Selenopidae,
Cheiracanthiidae and Miturgidae (in part) (Figures 20,
S6). The remaining Corinnidae taxa (26 terminals)
were monophyletic (Fig. S6).
[Correction added on 31 October 2023, after ﬁrst
online publication: This sentence has been revised.]
Azevedo et al. (2022) recovered Pronophaea group
within Corinnidae, yet our taxon sample differed from
their study and therefore this result could not be
tested.
Instead,
our
UCE
phylogeny
obtained
a
strongly supported Pronophaea group (two terminals)
as a sister group to the Viridasiidae + Selenopidae +
Cheiracanthiidae clade (Fig. 4).
Selenopidae
These cursorial spiders include nine genera and 281
species distributed globally, however with a large diver-
sity in the southern hemisphere (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023). Selenopids are dorsoventrally ﬂat and
extremely agile predators (Crews et al., 2008), and have
their posterior median eyes placed within the row of
anterior eyes (Ramırez, 2014). In Wheeler et al. (2017),
Selenopidae was a sister group to Viridasiidae. In our
UCE and Combined phylogenies, Selenopidae was
polyphyletic with the Australian endemic genus placed
as a sister group to Miturgidae and the other group
(which included the type genus Selenops) as a sister
group to Viridasiidae (Figs 4 and 20). The four gene
phylogeny of Crews & Gillespie (2010) included Kar-
aops (listed as “New Genus Australia”) which nested
within Selenopidae, albeit with poor support.
Miturgidae
This family includes c. 136 species classiﬁed into 28
genera (World Spider Catalog, 2023). Miturgidae was
monophyletic in our UCE phylogeny placed as a sister
group to Karaops (Selenopidae); however, the addition
of Parapostenus in the Combined and Dionycha data-
sets rendered the family polyphyletic (Fig. S6). Para-
postenus was placed as a sister branch to Viridasiidae
(in part). Wheeler et al. (2017) mention a possibility
that Parapostenus may be either a miturgid or a viri-
diasiid.
Although
Ramırez
(2014)
and
Azevedo
et al. (2022) recovered Miturgidae as a sister group to

Xenoctenidae, none of our analyses recovered this
placement.
Cheiracanthiidae
This family includes 362 species classiﬁed in 14 genera
with a cosmopolitan distribution (World Spider Cata-
log, 2023). They are diagnosed by the conical and con-
tiguous
anterior
lateral
and
posterior
median
spinnerets, an elongated article on posterior lateral spin-
nerets distally, eyes occupying the caput and curved
setae on the opisthosoma (Ramırez, 2014). The clado-
gram of Ramırez (2014) inferred that Eutichuridae (for-
mer name of Cheiracanthiidae, as discussed in the same
paper) was a sister group to a clade including Miturgi-
dae, Sparassidae, Philodromidae, Salticidae and Thomi-
sidae. With the six-marker dataset, Eutichuridae was a
sister group to Viridasiidae and Selenopidae, similar to
Azevedo et al. (2022), and our UCE and Combined
phylogenies, except that with the Combined data, the
sister group to Cheiracanthiidae included Parapostenus
sp. (Miturgidae) (Figs 4 and 20).
Viridasiidae
Viridasiidae is a small family including seven species
classiﬁed into three genera (Mahafalytenus, Viridasius
and Vulsor) primarily distributed in Madagascar and
nearby islands, with one species in Brazil. The natural
history of these spiders is poorly known; however,
Bauer et al. (2018) and Bauer (2021) reported that in
captivity, these spiders constructed silken retreats and
a pendulous egg sac covered with debris. In our Com-
bined analysis, Mahafalytenus (formerly in Ctenidae)
nested within Viridasiidae (Fig. 20), similar to the
result of Wheeler et al. (2017). The recent Azevedo
et al. (2022) also recovered this placement and for-
mally transferred Mahafalytenus to Viridasiidae.
Conclusions
1. The classiﬁcation of spiders and the hypotheses
about their phylogenetic relationships have signiﬁ-
cantly changed in the last decades. Several morpho-
logical features that have been traditionally used to
circumscribe higher taxa have evolved or been lost
multiple times independently. For example, higher
taxa are no longer grouped strictly by presence or
absence of cribellum, and several families such as
Oecobiidae and Udubidae have both cribellate and
ecribellate members. It is clear that this character,
which once weighed over spider classiﬁcation, has
been lost multiple times during the evolution of this
group. Although haplogyne spiders are not a clade, a
general trend from the haplogyne to the entelegyne
condition is suggested by the recent literature, even
in the face of multiple convergences both ways.
Although the question of whether the orb weavers
are a monophyletic group or not seems to have con-
verged onto a stable answer (Orbiculariae is not a
clade), the hypothesis of a single origin of the orbweb
remains debated. The scattering of orb weaving
groups in the spider tree of life offers a great chal-
lenge for hypothesizing a single origin of the orb web
using phylogenetic comparative methods. Thus, in
spiders the story tends to be one of groups being
deﬁned by a single character, that is later undone
and the deﬁning character turns out to be homopla-
sious. Large-scale analyses of genomic data have
contributed to a better understanding of both spider
phylogeny and the evolution of their morphological
features
and
spinning
products.
Phylogenetic
hypotheses at the interfamilial level have changed in
most families, whereas the intergeneric relationships
remain poorly and insufﬁciently understood.
2. Using a combination of newly generated and pub-
licly
available
genome-scale
data
and
Sanger-
sequencing-based six-marker datasets, we produced
the most comprehensive phylogenomic inference of
the spider tree of life in terms of taxa (128 spider
families ~97% sampling, 1362 terminals). The ana-
lyses recovered some highly supported placements
that reject the monophyly of certain families, for
example, the placement of Gnaphosidae. However,
previous studies indicated similar placements based
on morphology or molecular data. The subsetting
of the Combined dataset to Marronoid and Diony-
chan datasets rendered some polyphyletic families
such as Trachelidae as monophyletic, which reveals
an
interesting
phenomenon
that
needs
further
exploration. We are aware of and emphasize the
limitations of our dataset and therefore resorted to
only review these phylogenetic placements; we do
not make any formal taxonomic changes.
3. Our results covered several taxonomic hierarchical
levels, cemented various hypotheses on important
family-level relationships and allowed us to identify
the stable phylogenetic relationships across the spi-
der tree of life. We identiﬁed the unstable areas of
the cladogram and discussed the conﬂicting hypoth-
eses resulting from various classes of data such as
morphology, Sanger-sequencing-based markers, and
genomic-scale
data
such
as
transcriptomes
and UCEs. We recognize that future studies are
warranted to focus on certain groups of the spider
tree of life (e.g. RTA clade, marronoid clade, Hah-
niidae and Araneoidea). Our review can help to
design studies targeting taxonomic groups in need
of systematic revisions.
4. Some clades supported by morphological characters
are corroborated by molecular data (such as in the

case of symphytognathoids), whereas some novel
groupings have made arachnologists review their
classiﬁcations over again (such as polyphyly of
theridioids). Many new spider phylogenetic studies
are published every year, thus recalibrating and
reﬁning the synapomorphies of those groups. These
continued efforts are helping us to better under-
stand how evolutionary processes have shaped the
diversiﬁcation of spiders. Spider systematics and
phylogenetics have never been this close to visualiz-
ing a highly comprehensive picture of their evolu-
tionary history at the family level.
5. Sequencing technologies continue to be increasingly
more cost-effective, and museum specimens are now
widely used for both morphology and molecular
sequencing. The tools to study morphology have
greatly advanced too, such as micro-computed-
tomography (microCT) scanning. We are now able
to see internal anatomical structures in a three-
dimensional view (e.g. Michalik and Lipke, 2013;
Wood & Parkinson, 2019), when previously mor-
phologists were restricted to histological sectioning
or dissection, typically resulting in a two-dimensional
photograph or illustration. MicroCT is a great
advantage
to
observing
fossils
(e.g.
Penney
et al., 2007), which is a morphology-based endeav-
our, and allows for hidden structures to be revealed.
This technique also allows for creating 3D digital
objects and was recently used to study the evolution
of carapace and cheliceral shapes across spiders, with
a focus on Araneoidea (Kallal & Wood, 2022).
Taxon sampling has grown comprehensively for
molecular data-based phylogeny and fossils, informed
by their morphology and ages, provide calibration
points for these phylogenies. Beyond the utility of dat-
ing phylogenies at nodes, fossils also are used as taxa
to be placed in a phylogeny, a method known as “tip-
dating”. Wood et al. (2013) used tip-dating to show
that Palpimanoidea diversiﬁcation was shaped by the
break-up of Pangaea in the Mesozoic. Recently, using
morphology
observed
under
microCT,
Magalhaes
et al. (2022) discovered that the holotype of Loxosceles
aculicaput Wunderlich, 2004 (Sicariidae) is actually a
misidentiﬁed Drymusidae, which was the ﬁrst fossil
from the latter family and placed in a phylogeny. Fos-
sils are also useful in reconstructing trait evolution.
Morphology
also
provides
observable
ontogenetic
information in the light of gene regulatory networks,
which is detectable to a certain extent in molecular
data by the timing and location of gene expression.
Although it is apparent that molecular data are domi-
nating phylogenetic studies, it is likely that this skewed
pattern will soon reach a tipping point. The advent of
the World Spider Trait database (Pekar et al., 2021) has
an enormous potential and will facilitate the study of
the evolution of a variety of characters across the spider
tree of life. Without morphological, behavioural and
natural history data, phylogenetic trees have limited
value because their explanatory power is based on their
ability to interpret phenotypic and other biological
observations. Both morphology and molecules are grad-
ually converging to unravel a more precise understand-
ing of evolutionary history. It is perhaps the most
exciting time so far for advancing our knowledge about
the evolution of spiders.
