The ﬁrst discovered of what we would now call an elementary particle is the elec-
tron; although its discovery was a long and complicated process, J. J. Thomson’s
experiments of 1897 played a decisive role, since he was the ﬁrst to obtain a quanti-
tative value for e. Remarkably, precision experiments conducted last year (2006) [1]
show that the electron still possesses no structure other than that demanded by quan-
tum mechanics and relativity – it is a point particle. The proton, as the nucleus of
the hydrogen atom, was identiﬁed as soon as the Rutherford scattering experiment
demonstrated the  model of the atom ( large-angle scattering); its partner in the
nucleus, the neutron, was discovered by Chadwick in 1932. (For a review of the
history of particle physics told in words of some of its creators, see Ref. [13]. See
also Refs. [14,15].)
Antiparticles were theoretically predicted by P.A.M. Dirac in 1928 on the basis
of his famous  Dirac equation describing the relativistic electron, or more gener-
ally, any particle carrying  spin ℏ/2 [2]. At ﬁrst he thought the positive proton was
the antiparticle to the negative electron, but then he was convinced that the antipar-
ticle had to have the same mass as the particle (this is now seen as a consequence
of the famous  CPT theorem). The positron was actually discovered in 1933 by
Anderson, Blackett, and Occhialini [3]. The antiproton was found in 1955 [4].
Nuclear forces were studied extensively in the 1930s, aided immeasurably by
the use of Lawrence’s cyclotron. It was clear that new forces beyond those known
since ancient times, gravity and electromagnetism, had to come into play in order to

hold the nucleus together, overcoming the strong Coulomb repulsion of its positive
protons. Yukawa in 1935 proposed the existence of a mesotron (now meson); the
exchange of which between protons and neutrons could explain the strong nuclear
force [5]. (This was analogous to the explanation of electromagnetism through the
exchange of the massless photon between charged particles  QED.) However, un-
like electromagnetism strong nuclear forces have a very short range (∼10−15 m),
and so, by the  Heisenberg uncertainty principle, must correspond to the exchange
of a massive particle some 200 times heavier than the mass of an electron. Indeed, in
1938 Neddermeyer and Anderson discovered a particle of mass ∼100 MeV,1 which
we now call the muon. However, these particles turned out to be not strongly inter-
acting, and resulted in a period of confusion, which was only resolved in 1947, when
what we now call the pion, indeed Yukawa’s mesotron, was discovered by Lattes,
Occhialini, and Powell at a mass of about 140 MeV. The pion (π) could decay into
a muon (μ) plus a neutrino (ν),
π± →μ± + ν,
where the superscripts denote the charges of the particles. The neutral, massless,
neutrino had been proposed by Pauli in 1930 to explain the apparent failure of the
conservation of energy in the so-called β-decay of the neutron,
n →p + e−+ ¯ν,
where the overbar signiﬁes that is actually an antineutrino that is produced here.
(This is called β-decay because the electron was earlier called a β-ray.)
So the muon was the ﬁrst “unwanted” particle discovered. (I.I. Rabi once said,
“who ordered that?”) It turned out to be the ﬁrst member discovered of the second
generation or family. As new accelerators were built after the Second World War,
such as Berkeley’s Bevatron and Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Cosmotron, a
proliferation of new particles, mostly very strongly interacting and very unstable,
living only maybe 10−23 s, were discovered. Many of these particles carried a
new quantum number called “strangeness,” conserved by the strong interactions –
therefore the lightest of these lived much longer. By the late 1960s hundreds of
strongly interacting particles, dubbed hadrons, had been discovered. Some were
fermions, like the electron, having spin equal to an integer plus one-half times ℏ;
these were called baryons. Those whose spins where integers times ℏ, bosons, were
called mesons. (The  spin statistics theorem is reﬂected here: Only one fermion
can occupy a given quantum state, while any number of bosons can do so. The latter
allows for the phenomenon of  Bose condensation, which is responsible for  su-
perconductivity and  superﬂuidity.) This proliferation of particles represented a
crisis for particle physics, for not all these states could be elementary constituents
of matter.
1 In particle physics, it is customary to adopt “natural units” in which c = ℏ= 1.

Many efforts were made to bring order out of this chaos. The ﬁrst great success
came to Gell-Mann in 1961 [6] (there were of course precursors and competitors)
who proposed, not too seriously, the quark model as a mathematical way to organize
the various particles under a symmetry group called SU(3), the group of 3 × 3 uni-
tary matrices having determinant one. The reality of quarks was not taken seriously
until the late 1960s, when high-energy scattering experiments at Stanford (“deep-
inelastic scattering”) suggested, somewhat like the Rutherford model of the atom,
that point-like constituents existed inside the proton and neutron, which were ﬁrst
called partons, but are now recognized as quarks [7]. Quarks, see  Color Charge
Degree of Freedom in Particle Physics; Mixing and Oscillations of Particles; Parton
Model; QCD; QFT.
The next step was taken by Schwinger [8], Glashow [9], Weinberg [10], and
Salam [11], who discovered (1957–71) that electromagnetic and weak nuclear
forces (those responsible for β decay) could be “uniﬁed” into a single theory, the
so-called electroweak uniﬁcation. It is represented by the product of two groups,
SU(2)×U(1). To understand the strong nuclear force, Greenberg introduced the idea
of “color,” a new quantum number carried by quarks, and shortly after the success of
the electroweak theory, Gell-Mann and others proposed that color SU(3) (not to be
confused with the ﬂavor SU(3) mentioned in the previous paragraph) would be the
underlying symmetry of the strong interactions between the quarks, and thus was
born quantum chromodynamics or  QCD.
The resulting picture is called the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.
( Quantum ﬁeld theory). Matter is composed of fermions, quarks and leptons,
the latter being particles that feel the electroweak forces but not the strong ones.
The leptons consist of charged particles, like the electron and muon, and neutral
particles of very small mass, the neutrinos. The forces are carried by bosons: the
photon, and its weak partners, W± and Z0, and gluons, which come in eight color
states. The quarks and lepton occur in pairs, grouped in three families:

The masses of the quarks and leptons are given in Table 1. Neutrino masses are very
small, but now known to be nonzero. The neutrino ﬂavor eigenstates, which couple

phenomenon of neutrino mixing. This is a bit complicated to describe for three kinds
of neutrinos. If we make the approximation of two-state mixing, the probability of

(Here, for completeness, we make reference to gravity, which is not actually de-
scribed by the Standard Model.) The group-theory structure of the interactions
within the Standard Model are given by the product of three unitary groups:
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)
The mathematics of this group gives reaction rates that are completely in accord
with experiment.
We do not know where the masses of the elementary particles come from. In the
Standard Model, the masses are accommodated by another particle, the Higgs bo-
son. The Higgs boson is the only element of the Standard Model not yet discovered:
Since it has yet to be seen, mH > 115 GeV. The expectation is that the Higgs boson
will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Although there is no evidence that the Standard Model breaks down even at
the highest energies, and in fact, QED is valid to fantastic precision, and Newto-
nian gravity holds to ∼50 μm [12] (both these limits were greatly extended during
the past year), parameters (masses and couplings) in the Standard Model are un-
explained. Therefore many physicists speculate that new physics lies beyond the

Standard Model. The most popular extension is supersymmetry (SUSY), which
is the hypothesis that for every fermion there is a partner boson, and vice versa.
However, at present, there is no evidence for SUSY particles, and in fact strong
evidence against SUSY (coming from limits on the electric dipole moment of the
electron and neutron). It is hoped that supersymmetric partners to SM particles will
be found at the LHC. Other more exotic possibilities, such as signatures for large
extra dimensions (also rendered less likely by the precision gravity tests), will be
searched for there as well. See also Color Charge Degree in Particle Physics.
