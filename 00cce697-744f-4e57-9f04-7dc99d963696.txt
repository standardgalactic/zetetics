EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

Abstract 
Complex socio-scientific issues surrounding health or the environment, among others, are 
becoming increasingly controversial as the urgency for action increases. Learning and thinking 
critically about these issues requires epistemic cognition, i.e., thoughts and beliefs about the 
nature of knowledge, who holds knowledge, and how knowledge is justified. A review of the 
literature on epistemic cognition shows that epistemic cognition is a multifaceted phenomenon, 
including elements such as epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic 
emotions, yet many of these facets remain underexplored. The review also indicates that using 
more diverse and sophisticated methodologies is instrumental to advancing our understanding of 
epistemic cognition, as is the investigation of variables that may mediate relations between 
epistemic cognition and learning outcomes. Epistemic emotions are identified as one promising 
mediational mechanism that may explain how epistemic cognition relates to important outcomes. 
On the basis of this review, two manuscripts are proposed that address these issues. The first 
manuscript reports on two studies where a think-aloud methodology was employed to assess 
instances of epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-regulated learning during complex 
learning. Verbal data were used to examine the types of appraisals that serve as antecedents to 
epistemic emotions and to explore the immediate consequences of epistemic emotions for self-
regulated learning. A path analysis using self-report and verbal data provided support for a 
model of epistemic emotions as mediators between epistemic cognition and learning processes 
and outcomes. The second study tested the generalizability of this model by examining the 
mediational role of epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and 
critical thinking. Theoretical contributions, implications, limitations, and future directions are 
discussed.

Résumé 
Les problématiques socio-scientifiques complexes, liées par exemple à la santé ou à 
l'environnement, sont devenues aussi urgentes que controversées. Apprendre et avoir une pensée 
critique au sujet de ces questions nécessite une pensée épistémique adaptée, c’est-à-dire d’avoir 
une réflexion et d’adopter des croyances productives au sujet de la nature de la connaissance, à 
savoir qui la détient et comment elle est justifiée. Une recension des écrits sur la cognition 
épistémique montre que celle-ci est multiple, incluant des éléments tels que les croyances 
épistémiques, les objectifs épistémiques, les stratégies épistémiques et les émotions 
épistémiques, tout en indiquant que plusieurs de ces facettes demeurent empiriquement peu 
explorées. Les conclusions de cette recension indiquent également que pour améliorer notre 
compréhension de la cognition épistémique, il est essentiel d’utiliser des méthodologies plus 
diverses et sophistiquées, ainsi que d’investiguer les variables médiatrices susceptibles 
d’intervenir dans la relation entre la cognition épistémique et l’apprentissage. Les émotions 
épistémiques sont identifiées comme un mécanisme médiateur prometteur qui pourrait expliquer 
l’influence de la cognition épistémique sur des résultats importants. Ces lacunes font l’objet de 
deux articles présentés ici. Le premier article décrit deux études empiriques où la cognition 
épistémique, les émotions épistémiques et l'apprentissage autorégulé sont mesurés à l’aide d’un 
protocole de réflexion à voix haute au cours d'un épisode d’apprentissage complexe. Ces données 
ont été utilisées pour examiner les types d’évaluations cognitives qui servent d’antécédents aux 
émotions épistémiques, ainsi qu’afin d’explorer les conséquences immédiates des émotions 
épistémiques sur l’apprentissage autorégulé. Une analyse de trajectoire appuie un modèle 
prédictif où les émotions épistémiques constituent un médiateur entre la cognition épistémique et 
les divers processus et résultats d'apprentissage. Le deuxième article présente une deuxième

Introduction 
 
 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 2 
The digital age is changing how we relate to knowledge. The advent of the web, social 
media, algorithmic filtering, and the proliferation of massive amounts of data is creating a 
situation where knowledge is increasingly dispersed across networks, resulting in inescapable 
echo chambers and the deinstitutionalization of learning. Indeed, the way individuals search, vet, 
build, and use knowledge today is by accessing a variety of sources of information that vary in 
credibility and trustworthiness. The multiplicity of voices is replacing the monolithic 
authoritative sources of knowledge that once illuminated minds, revealing the fundamentally 
complex and uncertain nature of knowledge, and the challenges of knowing. 
Still, traditional and mainstream educational systems, by relying on prescribed 
knowledge representations and enforcing an answer-oriented assessment culture, promote an 
understanding of knowledge as objective and factual. As a result, transitioning from learning in 
the “safe” educational environment into the “wild,” uncertain world can pose a challenge for 
many. Successfully managing that transition requires epistemic cognition. Epistemic cognition 
refers to the process by which learners think about the forms of knowledge, its criteria and limits, 
to decide what to do or what to believe (Greene, Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016). 
For those who are unprepared, being faced with the world’s uncertainty and complexity is 
an experience that is likely to leave individuals feeling anxious, confused, or frustrated, among 
others. Throughout this dissertation, these knowledge- and knowing-related emotions are termed 
epistemic emotions. Despite long-standing calls to explore the affective facet of epistemic 
cognition (e.g., Mansfield and Clinchy, 2002; Pintrich, 2000), little research to date has been 
dedicated to addressing this matter and important questions remain unanswered. How do 
epistemic emotions relate to epistemic cognition? What epistemic emotions are experienced by 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 3 
individuals in different contexts? What role do epistemic emotions play in learning processes? 
And how can these emotions be leveraged to improve important educational outcomes? 
The purpose of this dissertation is to theoretically and empirically address these questions 
by investigating the nature and function of epistemic emotions in the context of complex 
learning. What I intend to demonstrate with this thesis is that contending with complex and 
controversial knowledge elicits knowledge- and knowing-related beliefs, cognitions, and 
emotions that relate to learning and higher-order thinking processes such as critical thinking. In 
Chapter 3, I demonstrate that epistemic cognition is a significant predictor of epistemic 
emotions, and that epistemic emotions significantly mediate relations between epistemic 
cognition and self-regulated learning. Further, I demonstrate that predictable sequences of 
occurrences exist between epistemic emotions and learning strategies. In Chapter 4, I 
demonstrate that relations between epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions can be 
generalized to other higher-order thinking processes, namely critical thinking.  
Additional themes are explored throughout this dissertation that link together the three 
manuscripts contained herein: (1) controversial socio-scientific issues (2) a broadened 
conceptualization of epistemic cognition, and (3) novel research methodologies. First, epistemic 
cognition is likely to be most relevant in situations where knowledge is at issue, such as when 
conflicting claims of varied levels of credibility exist on the same issue, or when phenomena are 
represented by opposing perspectives that propose seemingly irreconcilable explanations. This is 
the case of the topics of focus in Chapter 3 (i.e., climate change) and Chapter 4 (i.e., genetically 
modified foods). Second, whereas most research on epistemic cognition to date has focused 
solely on individuals’ epistemic beliefs (Greene, Cartiff & Duke, 2018; Muis & Singh, 2018), in 
this dissertation, I adopt a broadened conceptualization of epistemic cognition that is better 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 4 
aligned with recent frameworks and which considers epistemic cognition as multifaceted, 
comprised not only of epistemic beliefs, but also of epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and 
epistemic experiences, including epistemic emotions (Muis & Singh, 2018). This decision was 
made as the result of a review of the literature on the subject (see Chapter 2) which guided the 
experimental design and analyses of the studies contained herein. Third, I identify limitations 
associated with traditional research methodologies used in epistemic cognition research (Chapter 
2) and adopt methodologies that are aligned with a broadened conceptualization of epistemic 
cognition, namely in the form of a think-aloud protocol that allowed me to operationalize 
distinctions between epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, and epistemic strategies (Chapter 3). I 
also present an analytic technique seldom used in emotion research, namely a state-transition 
analysis, that allowed me to study relations between epistemic emotions and learning processes 
on a small timescale (Chapter 3). 
Overall, the manuscripts contained in the dissertation address the following 
complimentary research questions: 
1) What is epistemic cognition and how can it be measured? (Chapter 2) 
2) What epistemic emotions are experienced during learning of complex and controversial 
socio-scientific topics, and what are the antecedents of these epistemic emotions? 
(Chapters 3 and 4)  
3) What are the immediate and general consequences of epistemic emotions on processes of 
self-regulated learning? (Chapter 3) And do these consequences generalize to other high-
order thinking processes, such as critical thinking? (Chapter 4) 
4) What role do epistemic emotions play in mediating the relationship between epistemic 
cognition and learning processes and outcomes? (Chapters 3 and 4) 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 5 
In addressing these questions, this dissertation contributes new knowledge in 
understanding the role of epistemic cognition in complex learning and thinking situations, and 
further contributes to understanding the nature and role of epistemic emotions in these contexts. 
As a result, this dissertation adds information that can be used to elaborate guidelines for 
teachers and science communicators to better leverage individuals’ beliefs, cognitions, and 
emotions to promote greater learning and critical thinking in a complex and uncertain world. 
Overview of the Chapters  
To address the above-mentioned questions, Chapter 2 presents a critical and 
comprehensive review of the literature on epistemic cognition. The review addresses the 
following questions: How can epistemic cognition be conceptualized, and how can it be 
measured? I also highlight unresolved issues in theories of epistemic cognition and identify 
elements contained in current conceptualizations that are likely to form fruitful avenues to 
advance knowledge on epistemic cognition. These avenues for future work include the study of 
epistemic emotions as one mediational mechanism to explain how epistemic cognition relates to 
learning processes and outcomes. Further, this review provides the basis on which I critique 
methods typically employed to measure epistemic cognition, which guided methodological 
choices throughout the dissertation.  
 
Chapter 3 presents two empirical studies that employed self-report instruments and a 
think-aloud protocol to gather data on the antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions. 
This data collection was conducted in the context of a complex learning situation that involved 
learning about a controversial socio-scientific topic across multiple conflicting documents. Study 
1 presents an exploration of three antecedents of epistemic emotions and the identification of 
sequences of transitions between epistemic emotions and learning and epistemic strategies. 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 6 
Further, I empirically explore relations between offline epistemic beliefs and online epistemic 
cognition, which constitutes one of the unique contributions of this study. In Study 2, I use self-
report and verbal data to test a predictive model of epistemic emotions as mediators between 
epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning processes and outcomes.  
 
Chapter 4 further tests the generalizability of this model by examining the mediational 
role of epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and one important 
higher-order thinking process: critical thinking. Results from this study provide further support 
for the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition and adds substantial nuances to our 
understanding of the role of several epistemic emotions.  
 
Lastly, Chapter 5 concludes this dissertation with a summary of the theoretical and 
methodological contributions to the advancement of knowledge, along with a discussion of the 
limitations and future directions for research.

The 21st century, marked by unprecedented access to information and the explosion of self-
authored, unregulated content, poses the challenge of educating individuals who can discern 
useful and trustworthy contributions to knowledge from fraudulent, dogmatic, or otherwise fake 
claims (Sandoval, Greene, & Bråten, 2016). Thinking deeply and critically about matters of 
knowledge is not something that comes easily or naturally, and teaching students to think in such 
ways is challenging (Sinatra, Kienhues, & Hofer, 2014). As will be addressed in this chapter, 
there exists a growing body of literature that indicates that epistemic cognition “matters” (Kuhn 
& Weinstock, 2002). Broadly stated, epistemic cognition refers to how people understand, 
construct, and reason about knowledge, its sources and justification. Individuals engage in 
epistemic cognition when they are required to determine who or what to believe, problem solve, 
or make decisions about knowledge or information problems (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; Greene, 
Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016a; Sinatra, 2016).  
Empirically, epistemic cognition has been related to competent self-regulated learning, 
motivation, and learning achievement (Muis, 2004; 2007). However, a recent meta-analysis 
shows that the effect of epistemic cognition on learning achievement is significant but 
surprisingly small (Greene, Cartiff, & Duke, 2018). Understanding the conceptual and 
methodological challenges inherent to the field of epistemic cognition can help interpret this 
finding and illuminate paths forward to advance knowledge on epistemic cognition. As such, the 
goal of the present chapter is to construct a knowledge foundation that can be used to advance 
this promising line of research. Specifically, I ask the following questions: 1- How is epistemic 
cognition conceptualized? And 2- What methods can be used to examine epistemic cognition?  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
10 
To answer these questions, I first review traditional and contemporary frameworks of 
epistemic cognition and underline their unique contributions and shortcomings. Second, I outline 
the challenges inherent to epistemic cognition measurement, and explore solutions.  
Part 1: What is Epistemic Cognition and How Is It Conceptualized? 
The study of epistemic cognition can be situated at the crossroads of psychology (e.g., 
Piaget’s [1950] genetic epistemology), sociology (e.g., Thomas Kuhn’s [1962] structures of 
scientific revolutions) and philosophy, reaching as far back as the works of Plato and Aristotle. 
In educational psychology, the interest for epistemic cognition is in understanding the nature and 
functions of individuals’ thoughts and beliefs about how knowledge is acquired, justified and 
used. Throughout this chapter, I use the term epistemic cognition (e.g., Chinn, Buckland, & 
Samarapungavan, 2011; Greene et al., 2016a) to refer to this broad area of research. Other 
scholars have used the terms personal epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997), epistemic beliefs 
(e.g., Muis, Bendixen, & Haerle, 2006), and epistemic thinking (e.g. Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; 
Muis & Singh, 2018). The aim of this section is to review the frameworks that populate the field 
of epistemic cognition through a presentation of different perspectives’ components, 
assumptions, contributions, and limitations. Against this backdrop, current trends and issues are 
discussed. 
Given their conceptual importance and prominence in this chapter, it is crucial to 
differentiate between various “epistemic” terms. As mentioned above, I choose the term 
epistemic cognition to refer to both the field of investigation and the phenomenon of individuals’ 
thoughts, beliefs, and processes that relate to the nature of knowledge and knowing. Further, 
epistemological beliefs (e.g., Schommer, 1990) or epistemic beliefs (e.g., Muis et al., 2006; Muis, 
2007) are used to refer to individuals’ tacit beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing. 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
11 
Greene, Azevedo, and Torney-Purta (2008) aptly argued that the term “epistemological” refers to 
the study of epistemology, whereas the term “epistemic” evokes more accurately what is 
concerned with knowledge and knowing per se. As such, students are much more likely to hold 
“epistemic beliefs” (beliefs about knowledge and knowing) than “epistemological beliefs” 
(beliefs about the study of epistemology). Epistemic cognition, on the other hand, can be seen as 
a situated, dynamic process of thinking, used to reason, problem solve, or make decisions about 
information problems (Hofer, 2016; Sinatra, 2016). The content of epistemic cognition draws 
upon more stable cognitive and metacognitive structures such as knowledge, beliefs, and 
strategies. In the ensuing pages, I respect and use the terminology employed by authors when 
discussing their work. 
Perspectives in Epistemic Cognition 
 
The field of epistemic cognition comprises various frameworks that have frequently been 
grouped into three distinct perspectives (e.g., Hofer, 2001): the developmental, 
multidimensional, and epistemological resources perspectives. For the purpose of this review, 
recent frameworks have been grouped into a fourth perspective that I call “new 
conceptualizations.” 
The developmental perspective. The major tenet of the developmental perspective is 
that epistemic cognition develops throughout the lifespan, and that epistemic development is a 
crucial part of education. The developmental perspective is largely derived from the work of 
Perry (1970), who proposed a sequence of stages of epistemic growth that characterize the 
intellectual development of university students during their college years. Many scholars have 
endeavored to refine and extend Perry’s developmental sequence. Each framework introduces a 
sequence of developmental phases that reflect qualitative changes in epistemic cognition.

12 
Notable frameworks that have adopted a developmental perspective include Belenky and 
colleagues’ (Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, & Tarule, 1986) “ways of knowing” framework, 
Baxter Magolda’s (1992; 2004) epistemological reflection framework, King and Kitchener’s 
(1994; 2004) reflective judgment framework, and Kuhn and colleagues’ framework of 
epistemological understanding, more aptly labelled argumentative reasoning (Kuhn, 1991; Kuhn, 
Cheney & Weinstock, 2000; Kuhn, & Park, 2005; Kuhn & Weinstock, 2002). I next elaborate on 
Kuhn and colleagues’ framework, as the developmental sequence they proposed consolidates 
previous conceptual efforts, and as such, has gained prominence that still holds to date.  
Kuhn et al. (2000) proposed a sequence of three developmental phases that reflect a 
progressive integration and coordination of the objective and subjective dimensions of knowing. 
These levels of development include (1) absolutism, (2) multiplism, and (3) evaluativism. 
Individuals who embrace an absolutist view believe that assertions are either correct or incorrect, 
and that facts represent reality, such that knowledge is objective and certain. This form of 
thinking often characterizes thinking in childhood but can be observed in older persons. 
Individuals who adopt a multiplist perspective view knowledge as subjective, uncertain, and 
idiosyncratic. This epistemic orientation is often characteristic of adolescents, who tend to view 
assertions as freely chosen opinions. Lastly, evaluativists reconcile the objective and subjective 
aspects of knowledge and knowing. Evaluativists acknowledge that certain opinions are more 
justified than others, based on the evaluation of arguments and evidence via norms of inquiry. 
This perspective is more likely to develop in late adolescence or adulthood, if ever.  
Taken together, the developmental frameworks include a number of assumptions. The 
central assumption of this perspective is that the development of epistemic cognition is 
characterized by a sequence of one-dimensional, qualitatively different stages, and consists of 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
13 
fully abandoning one stage to enter a more advanced one. This assumption has been challenged 
by Schommer (1990), among others, who proposed that epistemic development should instead be 
conceived as multidimensional, where different dimensions develop at various rates. A second 
important assumption of the developmental frameworks is that individuals’ stages of 
development are not specific to a particular field or domain of knowledge. This assumption has 
been challenged namely by Hofer (2000), and later by Muis et al. (2006), who showed that 
patterns in epistemic development vary across domains. A last key assumption is that the 
development of epistemic cognition beyond the initial positions (e.g., absolutist stage) does not 
begin until learners reach college. This assumption has been challenged by results obtained by 
others (see Chandler, Hallett & Sokol, 2002; Kuhn et al., 2000, Mason & Scirica, 2006), who 
found that younger students are capable of displaying more advanced epistemic cognition.  
Aside from the challenged assumptions mentioned above, the developmental frameworks 
have been criticized for their lack of consideration for the cultural specificity of epistemic 
cognition and its development. For instance, do children adopt an absolutist view of knowledge 
as a result of an inevitable developmental pattern, or due to the influence of beliefs conveyed in 
the home environment? To this point, Muis et al. (2006) suggested that epistemic beliefs are 
socially constructed and context-bound, and that epistemic beliefs conveyed at home are likely to 
influence the beliefs a child adopts before entering the educational system.  
In sum, the epistemic developmental theories have made important contributions to the 
epistemic cognition literature, first by proposing a developmental sequence of personal 
epistemology that is still widely referred to these days. Another notable contribution has been to 
establish the importance of epistemic cognition in educational psychology by connecting facets 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
14 
of epistemic cognition to other skills such as argumentation (Kuhn, 1991; 1993), critical thinking 
(Kuhn, 1999), self-reflection, and justification (King & Kitchener, 1994; 2004).  
The multidimensional perspective. Researchers who assume a multidimensional 
perspective have focused on identifying the underlying dimensions of epistemic cognition, as 
well as identifying how variations on these dimensions can be more or less availing for learning 
processes and outcomes. The central assumption is that epistemic cognition draws from 
epistemic beliefs, and that the way learners apprehend and contend with knowledge is influenced 
by these beliefs (Hofer, 2001). This line of research was initiated by Schommer (1990), who 
questioned the assumption that epistemic cognition is one-dimensional. Schommer proposed a 
multidimensional framework of epistemological beliefs that includes five independent but related 
dimensions to epistemic beliefs. She stipulated that beliefs develop alongside each dimension 
from a basic or “naïve” position to a more mature or “sophisticated” position (Schommer, 1994).  
Building from Schommer’s framework, Hofer and Pintrich (1997) later proposed a four-
dimensional framework of epistemic beliefs. The first dimension, the certainty of knowledge, 
refers to beliefs about the nature of knowledge, from the belief that truths are fixed and 
unchanging to the belief that knowledge is tentative and evolving. The simplicity of knowledge 
also concerns the nature of knowledge, ranging from the belief that knowledge is best described 
as an accumulation of independent and concrete facts, to the belief that knowledge consists of a 
complex structure of interrelated propositions. The source of knowledge concerns the process of 
knowing and refers to the role of the self and others as sources of knowledge. A less 
constructivist view is that knowledge originates outside of the self and resides in experts or other 
authorities. A more constructivist view conceptualizes the self as a knower who has the ability to 
generate knowledge via active construction. The last dimension, the justification for knowing 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
15 
concerns how individuals evaluate knowledge claims, from an unquestioning reliance on 
authorities (e.g., experts, teachers, textbook authors) to the examination, evaluation, and 
integration of evidence, reasons, and arguments from various perspectives. Presumably, as 
epistemic beliefs develop into more constructivist forms, individuals become better able to detect 
and address incongruent knowledge representations, questionable sources, and unjustified 
knowledge claims. 
The multidimensional frameworks first assumed the domain generality of epistemic 
beliefs. Later, at the outcome of an extensive review of theoretical and empirical literature, Muis 
et al. (2006) proposed that epistemic beliefs are both domain-general and domain-specific. Muis 
et al. proposed the Theory of Integrated Domain in Epistemology (the TIDE framework) which 
stipulates that individuals first develop general epistemic beliefs, then academic epistemic 
beliefs, and later, domain-specific epistemic beliefs, as individuals deepen their understanding of 
certain academic or professional domains. Muis and colleagues explained that these beliefs are 
mutually influential. 
In terms of assumptions, the multidimensional frameworks assume that epistemic beliefs 
do not develop homogeneously, indicating that a learner can simultaneously espouse more and 
less constructivist beliefs on different dimensions. It is also assumed that epistemic beliefs 
develop from a “naïve” to a “sophisticated” view of knowledge. Although the terms “naïve” and 
“sophisticated” have been criticized for insinuating that researchers know what is best to believe 
(Schommer-Aikins, 2002; Muis, 2004), the terms continue to be widely used in the literature to 
date. Alternatively, the terms “availing and non-availing” (Muis, 2004) as well as “less and more 
constructivist” (e.g., Muis, 2007) have been suggested. However, the assumption that mature 
beliefs always align with a constructivist epistemology has been challenged by Chinn et al., 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
16 
(2011), and more recently by Greene and Yu (2014). In their philosophically anchored 
framework, Chinn et al. (2011) argued that individuals may choose to take the stance of certainty 
towards claims that appear to be extremely well justified. Indeed, Greene and Yu (2014) found 
that experts sometimes adopt the view that some form of knowledge (such as “bedrock” 
historical knowledge) is simple and certain, which is a belief typically associated with a naïve or 
less constructivist view. 
 
 
Lastly, an assumption that is prevalent in multidimensional frameworks is that epistemic 
beliefs are amenable to change. Whereas epistemic development is viewed as the result of a 
maturation process, epistemic change is better described as variations in epistemic cognition that 
result from interactions with various contexts (Muis, Trevors, & Chevrier, 2016). Indeed, several 
researchers have been successful at obtaining lasting change in beliefs with short text-based 
interventions (Bromme, Pieschl, & Stahl, 2010; Ferguson & Bråten, 2013; Porsch & Bromme, 
2011), as well as longer-term instructional interventions (Muis & Duffy, 2013). However, others 
have observed that text-based interventions can lead to regression towards less constructivist 
beliefs (Kienhues, Bromme & Stahl, 2008). Overall, empirical evidence suggests that epistemic 
change is arduous and unlikely to happen spontaneously without specifically targeted 
interventions (Sinatra, 2016).  
Taken together, the multidimensional frameworks have made key contributions that still 
shape the field of epistemic cognition today. First, these frameworks have introduced the notion 
of epistemic beliefs as a system of more or less independent dimensions. Second, they brought 
greater emphasis to the relation between epistemic beliefs and other facets of learning, such as 
academic performance (Schommer, 1990), learning strategies (Schommer, Crouse & Rhodes, 
1992), and motivation (Muis, 2004). Another important contribution has been to adopt a more 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
17 
quantitative approach to epistemic beliefs research than theretofore, triggered by the need to 
statistically test the multidimensionality proposed in frameworks.  
The multidimensional frameworks, however, are not without limitations. These include a 
lack of consideration for the context specificity of epistemic cognition, a lack of integration of 
philosophical considerations in epistemic cognition, as well as a narrow focus on epistemic 
beliefs as a unique component of epistemic cognition. These limitations have been taken on by 
researchers who proposed alternative frameworks, which are presented next. 
The epistemological resources perspective. Hammer and Elby (2002; 2003) proposed 
that epistemic cognition operates on the basis of fine-grained and context-specific cognitive 
resources that they call epistemological resources. The authors observed that individuals, from a 
very young age on, draw from a multitude of epistemological resources to apprehend knowledge 
and knowing. Epistemological resources refer to believed propositions about the nature of 
knowledge (e.g., “knowledge as direct perception”), as well as the resources used to understand 
epistemological activities (e.g., “accumulation” of knowledge), epistemological forms (e.g., 
“categories”), or epistemological stances (e.g., “doubting”). This framework challenges the idea 
that epistemic beliefs are stable across contexts. The authors argue that the activation of 
epistemological resources is context- and content-dependent, and as such, is likely to vary 
throughout a single learning task.  
The epistemological resources perspective has contributed a greater emphasis on the 
context specificity of epistemic cognition, as well as the dynamic nature of belief activation. 
However, this perspective has limited potential for empirical research as it does not offer well-
fleshed predictions with regard to relations between epistemological resources and other learning 
processes and outcomes and is missing a clear perspective on epistemic development.

New conceptualizations: Beyond epistemic beliefs. A broader perspective on epistemic 
cognition has recently emerged, one that goes beyond the sole focus on individuals’ beliefs about 
knowledge and knowing. New frameworks take into account a wider variety of epistemic 
phenomena, including components borrowed from psychology and philosophy (e.g., epistemic 
emotions [Muis et al., 2015]), epistemic vice and virtues [Chinn et al., 2011], and ontological 
dimensions [Greene et al., 2008]).  
Epistemic and ontological cognition. Greene, Azevedo and Torney-Purta (2008) 
borrowed from developmental and multidimensional frameworks to propose a framework of 
epistemic and ontological cognition that emphasizes not only individuals’ beliefs about 
knowledge and knowing, but also the process by which beliefs are acquired and used. Greene et 
al. (2008) argued that given its centrality, the justification dimension of epistemic cognition 
should be better elaborated, and assigned a focal role in epistemic research, namely by exploring 
how and when individuals rely on various means of justification (i.e., justification by authority, 
personal justification, multiple sources). Greene et al. further argued that the justification 
dimension is the only one that is rightfully epistemic. The certainty and simplicity dimensions, 
they argued, tap into individuals’ views about the nature of reality and, as such, should be 
labelled ontological cognition.  
In terms of development, Greene et al. (2008) stipulated that individuals first develop 
absolutist beliefs that later morph into multiplicist beliefs, and that may later turn into 
evaluativistic beliefs. To address the fact that not all adults reach evaluativism, the authors 
proposed that there exist two paths for multiplicists: Individuals either adopt a dogmatic position, 
wherein they turn to authoritative sources to know what to believe, or else they adopt a skeptical 
stance, wherein they choose to view all knowledge as subjective and personal. Depending on 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
19 
experiences and circumstances, individuals may finally move into evaluativism, wherein they 
acknowledge the need for justification, and rely on a variety of means of justification that they 
use discriminately, depending on the context. 
New dimensions to epistemic cognition. Building from the work of Greene et al. (2008), 
Chinn, Buckland, and Samarapungavan (2011) presented a philosophically anchored framework 
that included substantial additions and extensions to previous frameworks that focused only on 
epistemic beliefs. The authors introduced an array of novel components: Epistemic aims refer to 
a subset of learning goals adopted by learners that relate to inquiry, and include attaining 
knowledge, understanding, or true beliefs. Epistemic virtues and vices refer to dispositions that 
facilitate or hinder the achievement or epistemic aims. Epistemic virtues are dispositions that 
assist individuals in accomplishing epistemic aims, and include for instance intellectual courage 
and open-mindedness. On the other hand, epistemic vices are another type of disposition that 
impedes the accomplishment of epistemic aims, such as close-mindedness and dogmatism. 
Further, reliable and unreliable processes refer to individuals’ theories or beliefs about whether 
the cognitive and metacognitive processes, and methods put in place to achieve epistemic aims 
are reliable or unreliable under the conditions in which they are used.  
Three facets of epistemic cognition. One persistent debate in the literature has been over 
the boundaries between cognitive and metacognitive aspects of personal epistemology. Barzilai 
and Zohar (2014) tackled that issue by proposing a framework that considers epistemic thinking 
(the term they employ) through the lens of metacognition. They proposed that epistemic thinking 
is multifaceted; specifically, that it includes three epistemic facets: a metacognitive, a cognitive, 
and an experiential facet. They define epistemic metacognition as the reflective level of personal 
epistemology. It includes epistemic metacognitive knowledge about persons as knowers 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
20 
(themselves as much as others), as well as about tasks and strategies that lead to knowledge. 
Epistemic metacognitive knowledge includes individuals’ epistemic beliefs about knowledge and 
knowing. Additionally, individuals develop epistemic metacognitive skills, which Barzilai and 
Zohar define as processes of regulation and control that involve planning, monitoring, and 
evaluation of individuals’ epistemic thinking. 
Epistemic cognition, in turn, is conceptualized by Barzilai and Zohar as the operational or 
strategic level of personal epistemology. It involves thinking about the knowledge- and knowing-
related characteristics of information, as well as engaging in epistemic strategies to evaluate 
knowledge claims. They define epistemic cognition as an inherently dynamic process that can 
manifest in the form of cognitive enactments. Barzilai and Zohar (2014) drew from the work of 
Richter and colleagues (Richter & Schmid, 2010; Schroeder, Richter, & Hoever, 2008) to define 
epistemic strategies as strategic cognitive activities that consider the epistemic status of 
information, and that are aimed at achieving reliable knowledge by evaluating knowledge claims 
and sources, considering multiple perspectives, and more. Epistemic strategies include, for 
instance, sourcing strategies (i.e., evaluating the trustworthiness of sources [Strømsø, Bråten & 
Britt, 2010]), knowledge validation strategies (i.e., evaluating whether knowledge claims are 
well justified [Richter & Schmid, 2010]), and integration strategies (i.e., providing explanations 
to account for differences between various perspectives [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012]).  
Lastly, Barzilai and Zohar (2014) proposed an experiential facet to personal 
epistemology. Epistemic experiences refer to cognitive or affective experiences that can arise in 
the face of uncertainty or ambiguity. Muis, Chevrier, and Singh (2018) have elaborated upon this 
third facet by proposing an integrated framework that incorporates the role of epistemic emotions 
in epistemic cognition.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
21 
The role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition. Muis et al. (2018) proposed a 
model of epistemic cognition anchored in a self-regulated learning perspective. The model’s 
main contribution has been to integrate the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition. 
Epistemic emotions are defined as affective experiences that arise out of information-oriented 
appraisals related to the alignment or misalignment between incoming information and existing 
beliefs or knowledge structures, or when inconsistencies or other discrepancies in processing the 
information cause cognitive disequilibrium (D’Mello, Lehman, Pekrun, & Graesser, 2014). 
Epistemic emotions include, for instance, surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, anxiety, 
frustration, and boredom (Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017).  
In their model, Muis and colleagues proposed that epistemic beliefs, epistemic values, 
and self-efficacy are activated as a task definition is produced. In turn, appraisals related to these 
beliefs and values predict the epistemic emotions that will arise during learning. They further 
suggested that epistemic emotions predict epistemic aims and other learning goals, and in turn 
predict learning processes and outcomes. Overall, they proposed that epistemic emotions mediate 
relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. In other words, epistemic emotions 
explain in part how epistemic cognition relates to self-regulated learning (Muis et al., 2015; 
Trevors et al., 2016). 
Taken together, the recent frameworks of epistemic cognition presented above make 
substantial contributions to the literature. Greene et al. (2008) contributed a framework that 
draws from philosophical epistemology and emphasizes the notion of epistemic cognition, as 
opposed to the sole notion of epistemic beliefs. One major contribution of Chinn et al.’s (2011) 
work has been to identify caveats in epistemic research that had not been addressed heretofore: 
They called upon researchers to examine how individuals’ conceptions of reliable processes may 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
22 
vary in different contexts, and to examine how epistemic cognition may vary across various 
types of knowledge (e.g., declarative, procedural, principled knowledge). Barzilai and Zohar’s 
(2014) metacognitive framework offered clear distinctions between epistemic metacognition and 
epistemic cognition that invite researchers to reconsider and clarify definitions. Lastly, Muis and 
colleagues’ (2018) model has responded to a long-standing call to integrate emotions into 
epistemic cognition research (see Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993; Sinatra, 2005) and have 
proposed epistemic emotions as one important mediator in the relationship between epistemic 
cognition and self-regulated learning. Taken together, the recent conceptual frameworks 
reviewed here provide the grounds on which new research questions and hypotheses can be 
proposed.  
Conceptual Issues 
 
The literature review presented above has led to the identification of underlying 
conceptual issues that are still unresolved to date. These include: the proliferation of new terms, 
the specificity of epistemic cognition, the nature of advanced or sophisticated epistemic 
cognition, and the nature and role of justification. These issues are discussed in turn. 
The proliferation of new terms. In the conclusion to their recent Handbook of epistemic 
cognition, Greene and colleagues (2016b) documented what they called “the proliferation of 
terms with some form of the adjective ‘epistemic’ attached” (p. 496). The underlying question is 
that of the value or usefulness of differentiating the “epistemic” version of a construct from its 
“non-epistemic” version. Alexander (2016) and Greene et al. (2016c) have warned against an 
explosion of terminology that may hurt the important principle of parsimony. Alexander (2016) 
called for more coherence and consistency in the language employed, and implored researchers 
to consider whether new terms add any explanatory power to the field before introducing them. 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
23 
In order to achieve a balance between parsimony and explanatory power, I argue that a 
criterion or criteria should be used to differentiate what is epistemic from what is not. 
Traditionally, authors have defined what is epistemic by emphasizing the knowledge- or 
knowing-related focus of a construct. Further, Chinn and colleagues (Chinn et al., 2011; Chinn & 
Reinhart, 2016) proposed to consider whether epistemic aims are present in order to determine 
whether a cognition or enactment is epistemic in nature. Finally, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that 
emotions such as frustration or anxiety can be considered epistemic when the object focus of the 
emotion is related to knowledge, knowing, and the processing of information. These latter 
criteria suggest an empirical avenue to explore whether various constructs are indeed connected 
to individuals’ epistemic cognition. 
Overall, I argue that the introduction of well-defined “epistemic” terms can be beneficial, 
first to advance our fundamental understanding of epistemic cognition, and second, to draw 
attention on this important facet of learning. Indeed, in spite of 40 years of empirical efforts that 
demonstrate that epistemic cognition “matters” (Kuhn & Weinstock, 2002), very few educational 
curricula take students’ (and teachers’) epistemic cognition into account when designing 
educational environments or devising instructional interventions (Hofer, 2016; Muis et al., 
2016).  
It is important to note that epistemic cognition researchers are not arguing that there exist 
epistemic constructs that are conceptually and empirically different from other cognitive and 
metacognitive aspects of thinking. Rather, epistemic cognition is situated within existing 
structures, and can be interpreted within existing frameworks (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; Bromme 
et al., 2010; Greene, Yu, & Copeland, 2014; Hofer, 2004a; Muis, 2007). In other words, what 
makes a construct “epistemic” is its concern, rather than its form. Distinguishing “epistemic” 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
24 
constructs from other motivational or contextual forces (i.e., distinguishing epistemic anxiety in 
the face of uncertain knowledge versus performance anxiety in the face of a test) may lead to the 
identification of undue conflations or unearth hidden mediators. In sum, more research will be 
needed to determine which epistemic mechanisms are actually in place, and to determine which 
terms should be retained in our common vocabulary.  
It is further important to note that epistemic cognition researchers are not arguing that all 
learning is epistemic, nor that all learning tasks should be designed to elicit epistemic cognition. 
For instance, memorizing the order of the planets in the solar system is certainly an activity that 
requires less epistemic cognition than building an argument after having consulted multiple 
sources. However, by positing the existence of epistemic cognition, epistemic aims, epistemic 
strategies, or epistemic emotions, researchers can better explore the specific mechanisms by 
which epistemic cognition occurs. Ultimately, such an endeavor may help researchers, educators, 
and policy makers to produce more specific instructional guidelines and curricula that foster the 
development of deeper learning, greater disciplinary integration, as well as high-order thinking.  
The specificity of epistemic cognition. The question of the contextual specificity of 
epistemic cognition has received much attention in recent years. One question concerns whether 
or not different epistemic belief dimensions should be taken into account across domains. 
Indeed, researchers who assume the domain-specificity of epistemic cognition also posit that 
underlying dimensions (i.e., simplicity, complexity, source, justification) are valid across all 
domains – that there are no dimensions that are unique to a particular domain. However, recent 
findings by Greene and Yu (2014) challenge this assumption: After having interviewed 
university professors in various disciplines, Greene et al. concluded to obvious similarities in less 
advanced, or “naïve,” beliefs across disciplines (e.g., the belief that knowledge corresponds to a 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
25 
list of facts) but found that advanced beliefs were much more differentiated across disciplines. 
For instance, biology professors referred to the importance of connected knowledge, whereas 
history professors focused on interpretations. In Greene and Yu’s (2014) words, “it is difficult to 
imagine a domain-general definition of the nature of knowledge factors that could capture 
advanced experimentation skills in biology, as well as historical empathy skills in history” (p. 
20).  
The nature of sophistication. Beyond the question of the suitability of epithets such as 
“naïve” or “less constructivist” to qualify less developed epistemic beliefs, the question of the 
nature of sophistication remains a current debate. One issue concerns the assumption that mature 
epistemic cognition (understood as the beliefs, sources evaluations and means of justification 
espoused by experts) is “more constructivist”. Indeed, evidence obtained by Greene and Yu 
(2014) indicates that experts at times espouse the belief that types of knowledge are rather simple 
and certain. This is the case, for example, of declarative knowledge in history, or of procedural 
knowledge in chemistry.  
A related issue is the problematic assumption that more constructivist beliefs are superior 
in all situations (see Bromme, Kienhues, & Stahl, 2008, Bromme et al., 2010; Greene, Muis, & 
Pieschl, 2010). Indeed, in instances where prior knowledge and epistemic aims are low (i.e., 
where basic understanding is sufficient), it may be more adaptive to assume that knowledge is 
simple and that experts are trustworthy sources. Alexander and colleagues (Alexander, 2016; 
Alexander, Winters, Loughlin, & Grossnickle, 2012; Maggioni, Fox, & Alexander, 2010) 
proposed the term epistemic competence to refer to an adaptive and flexible form of epistemic 
cognition. By this definition, competent learners recognize the potential unreliability of sources 
and the contestable nature of knowledge, but also consider content and context when determining 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
26 
the level of certainty and justification that may be required to accept a knowledge claim or 
source as acceptable. As such, the notion of “competent belief” appears to be a more accurate 
way of qualifying experts’ beliefs than the label “more constructivist.” 
The nature and role of justification. As Greene et al. (2008) have pointed out, 
philosophical epistemology has been concerned with the justification of knowledge as a primary 
focus. In multidimensional frameworks of epistemic cognition, “naïve” justification has been 
construed as the reliance on authorities and experts, whereas the reliance on one’s own means of 
justification, such as rational evaluation, has been deemed “sophisticated” (Schommer, 1990; 
Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). However, Greene et al. (2008) argued that the way justification is 
defined in multidimensional frameworks fails to consider the many means of justification that 
are valid and acknowledged in the philosophical literature. For example, Chinn et al. (2011) 
pointed out that philosophers regard knowledge claimed by experts as justified, provided that 
those experts are properly vetted. Chinn et al. proposed to refer to this type of justification as 
justification by testimony, where testimony is defined as all social forms of sharing information 
and knowledge with others. The authors further argued that most of what is known is learned 
from others, and that no one can actually evaluate all of what is learned through their own 
means. 
Another issue related to justification is that individuals do not always enact the 
evaluations that would be in accordance with their beliefs. Chinn and Brewer (1993) found that 
many scientists report that anomalous data should lead to model revision, yet many ignore 
anomalous data in their research. It might be the case that individuals’ espoused beliefs may have 
little to do with how they actually go about justifying knowledge claims in context. Overall, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
27 
more research is needed to investigate how individuals go about evaluating and justifying 
knowledge claims in different domains and contexts, and with different types of problems.  
Conclusion 
The above review provided a review of the existing theories of epistemic cognition. To 
this day, research on epistemic cognition continues to become richer, more diversified, and better 
integrated with other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, psychology). Nonetheless, the field still 
struggles to unify its various traditions, frameworks, and terms under a consolidated framework. 
Integrated theoretical frameworks like those proposed by Barzilai and Zohar (2014) or Muis and 
Singh (2018) appear to be a promising avenue, as future research on epistemic cognition will 
require rich frameworks from which to derive sophisticated research questions and hypotheses.  
The above review also shows that there exist several issues left to be resolved, as well as 
gaps that should be addressed. For instance, despite positive associations between epistemic 
cognition and several educational processes and outcomes, the correlation between epistemic 
cognition and learning achievement tends to be small (Greene et al., 2018). As was illustrated in 
this review, some possible explanations for this include the need to broaden conceptual horizons 
to include not only tacit and stable epistemic beliefs, but more dynamic and contextually-
anchored processes such as epistemic aims and epistemic strategies that may provide a fuller 
picture of epistemic cognition as it occurs in learning settings. Further, as argued by Bråten et al. 
(2011), there is a need to investigate mediational mechanisms that account for relations between 
epistemic cognition and important educational processes and outcomes. As exposed above, Muis 
and colleagues (Muis et al., 2018; Muis & Singh, 2018) advanced epistemic emotions as one 
such mediational mechanism; however, to date, little empirical work has been done to uncover 
the role that epistemic emotions may play in epistemic cognition.

One last possible explanation to the observed small effect of epistemic cognition on 
achievement is methodological in nature. As will be discussed in the next section, research on 
epistemic cognition to date has heavily relied on decontextualized self-report instruments to 
collect evidence of epistemic cognition. However, as the field moves towards conceptualizations 
where the situated and dynamic nature of epistemic cognition is taken into consideration, equally 
situated and dynamic research methods will be needed to further our understanding of the nature 
and role of epistemic cognition in learning. The next section offers a critical examination of the 
various methods that can be used to measure epistemic cognition.   
Part 2. What Methods Can Be Used to Measure Epistemic Cognition? 
Accurate measurement of epistemic cognition is crucial for many reasons. Undoubtedly, 
sound measurement is key to bolstering theoretical frameworks and advancing the field. But 
more importantly perhaps is that quick and accurate measurement is key to realizing the full 
educational implications of epistemic cognition, such as supporting the development and 
enactment of higher-order thinking skills. However, despite a number of publications dedicated 
to this issue, the measurement of epistemic cognition continues to be a challenge (Clarebout, 
Elen, Luyten, & Bamps, 2001; DeBacker, Crowson, Beesley, Thoma, & Hestevold, 2008; Wood 
& Kardash, 2002). Measuring epistemic cognition is arduous mainly because it is a complex and 
multifaceted construct. In this section, I first review how researchers from various theoretical 
perspectives have employed diverse methods to assess epistemic cognition and to advance 
knowledge in the field. Next, I identify the limitations of these methods, and offer suggestions to 
overcome them.  
Methods Used Within Perspectives  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
29 
The developmental perspective. As discussed above, developmental frameworks 
proposed a continuum of positions moving from absolutism, to multiplicism, to evaluativism. 
Historically, researchers interested in the development of personal epistemology have used 
qualitative methods to assign individuals a developmental position or epistemic stance. 
Following Perry (1970), researchers with a developmental focus have predominantly used semi-
structured interviews to understand individuals’ epistemic cognition. Often committing to a 
phenomenological approach to elicit respondents’ voices, interviews have allowed researchers to 
obtain rich data about learners’ worldviews, rapport to authority (Perry, 1970), decision-making 
processes (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004), and reasoning about ill-structured (King & Kitchener, 
1994; 2004) or moral (Belenky et al., 1986) problems. Interviews have been used in longitudinal 
studies (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004; King & Kitchener, 1994; 2004; Perry, 1970) or 
complimented with paper-and-pencil surveys (Baxter Magolda, 1992; 2004). Given the resource-
intensive nature of interviews, developmental researchers have later focused on developing 
scenario-based paper-and-pencil instruments (see Barzilai & Weinstock, 2015; Kuhn et al., 2000; 
Wood & Kardash, 2002). Vignettes with text and images have also been used with interviews to 
investigate children’s level of epistemic development (Mansfield & Clinchy, 2002). 
The multidimensional perspective. Multidimensional frameworks have conceptualized 
epistemic cognition as a system of more or less independent beliefs or theories that develop 
asynchronously. To test whether individuals espouse more or less sophisticated or constructivist 
beliefs on a number of dimensions, scholars have developed questionnaires where respondents 
self-report their level of agreement with numerous statements on Likert scales.  
Early epistemic beliefs questionnaires (i.e., Epistemological Questionnaire [EBQ; 
Schommer, 1990]; Epistemic Beliefs Inventory [EBI; Schraw, Bendixen, & Dunkle, 2002]), 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
30 
Epistemological Beliefs Survey [EBS; Wood & Kardash, 2002]) assessed domain-general 
beliefs, with statements that referred to knowledge in general. As the debate over the domain 
generality of epistemic beliefs unfolded, Muis et al. (2006) called upon researchers to measure 
individuals’ epistemic beliefs about a specific domain. Muis et al. (2006) argued that respondents 
presented with broadly stated items might be influenced by their domain of study or of expertise, 
which would compromise comparability across respondents. At first, domain-general 
questionnaires were turned into domain-specific versions by substituting domains of focus in 
items that otherwise remained the same (e.g., “Mathematics relates to day-to-day life” versus 
“Economics relate to day-to-day life”; Buehl, Alexander, & Murphy, 2002; see also Greene, 
Torney-Purta, & Azevedo, 2010; Hofer, 2000). Later, proper domain-specific questionnaires 
were developed, as well as topic-specific questionnaires (e.g., Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs 
Questionnaire [TSEBQ; Bråten, Gil, Strømsø, & Vidal-Abarca, 2009]). Researchers who 
adopted the multidimensional perspective have also used semantic differential measures (e.g., the 
Connotative Aspects of Epistemic Beliefs scale [CAEB; Stahl & Bromme, 2007]). Items in 
semantic differential instruments capture the evaluative judgments that individuals attribute to 
words to pairs of conflicting adjectives (e.g., “exact-vague”; “dynamic-static”).  
As will be discussed below, Likert-type instruments have received abundant criticism 
with regard to their poor psychometric properties. As a result, researchers from the 
multidimensional tradition have continually sought to develop alternative measures, turning to 
methodologies used, for instance, in self-regulated learning research. Think-aloud protocols, 
among others, have been successfully employed to assess epistemic cognition, including 
dimensions of epistemic beliefs, epistemic strategies, and epistemic aims (Chevrier et al., 2015; 
2016; Hofer, 2004a; Ferguson, Bråten, & Strømsø, 2012; Greene et al., 2014; Mason, Ariasi, & 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
31 
Boldrin, 2011; Mason, Boldrin, & Ariasi, (2010). Lastly, Greene et al. (2010) proposed 
computer-based learning environments to collect trace data (e.g., time logs, highlighting patterns, 
recorded notes) to infer epistemic cognition from learning behaviors.   
The epistemological resources perspective. Hammer and colleagues (2002; 2003) 
proposed that epistemic cognition can be conceptualized as epistemological resources that 
individuals activate as a function of contextual demands. Interviews (Hammer & Elby, 2002; 
2003) and direct observation (Louca, Elby, Hammer, & Kagey, 2004) have been the privileged 
methods of measurement used in this perspective. As no stability in epistemological resources is 
assumed across situations, contexts, or domain, only immersive measurement approaches 
sensitive to sociocultural variables are adequate here. 
New conceptualizations. The notion that epistemic cognition encompasses much more 
than epistemic beliefs is common across the recent frameworks reviewed above (e.g., Barzilai & 
Zohar, 2014; Chinn et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2008; Muis & Singh, 2018). Models such as 
Greene et al.’s (2008) and Muis and Singh’s (2018) assume that epistemic cognition 
encompasses relatively stable epistemic beliefs as well as more dynamic and context-specific 
components such as epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic emotions. As such, these 
researchers have combined quantitative and qualitative methods to test their models. For 
instance, Muis and colleagues’ (2018) integrated model has been tested with a combination of 
self-report questionnaires to capture learners’ epistemic beliefs and think-aloud protocols to 
capture learners’ epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic emotions (see Chevrier et 
al., under review; Muis et al., 2015). Likewise, Greene and colleagues tested their 2008 model 
with a self-report instrument (Greene et al., 2010), as well as with think-aloud protocols 
(Ferguson et al., 2012; Greene et al., 2014).

As exposed above, the alignment between a framework’s assumptions and the 
measurement methods used to test them is paramount. While these methods have participated to 
the elaboration of each framework and to the advancement of the field in general, each method 
comports limitations that force researchers to keep innovating. I next examine the affordances 
and limitations of each method. 
Affordances and Limitations of Employed Methods 
Likert-type self-report instruments. Likert scales are prevalent in epistemic cognition 
research, as in many branches of educational psychology, due to their manageable and 
inexpensive modes of administration. The chief advantage of these instruments is allowing 
individuals to report on constructs that are inherently personal and that can be hard to reveal. 
However, thorough examination of the psychometric properties of the most common self-report 
instruments used in epistemic cognition research has revealed issues of validity, reliability, and 
inaccuracy. In terms of validity, DeBacker et al.’s (2008) analysis of the factor structure of the 
Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ; Schommer, 1990), the Epistemic Beliefs Inventory (EBI; 
Schraw et al., 2002), and the Epistemic Beliefs Scale (EBS; Wood & Kardash, 2002) failed to 
provide support for the number of proposed epistemic belief dimensions. This is consistent with 
work by Hofer (2004a), who reported that certainty and simplicity did not emerge as separate 
factors in her Discipline-Focused Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (DFEBQ; Hofer, 2000). Hofer 
(2000) concluded that epistemic beliefs may not be as multifaceted as hypothesized, or else, be 
too multifaceted to be captured with Likert-scale questionnaires. 
The validity of Likert-scale questionnaires has also been problematic for developmental 
research. As pointed by Muis et al. (2006), it is difficult to determine what should constitute the 
breaking point in a continuum between a belief in authorities as true sources of knowledge (an 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
33 
absolutist or less constructivist belief), and a belief in the active construction of knowledge (an 
evaluatist or more constructivist belief). Indeed, disagreeing with a less constructivist statement 
is not a reliable indication of espousing a more constructivist belief (Greene et al., 2008; Greene 
& Yu, 2014; Hofer, 2004a; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997; Mason, 2016; Schommer, 1990). In other 
words, Likert scales create false dichotomizations in what should be a continuum in belief.  
The low reliability of Likert-scale questionnaires is another problematic issue in 
epistemic cognition measurement. DeBacker et al. (2008) found that the internal consistency of 
the EBQ was poor, whereas that of the EBS and the EBI were lower than desirable. Poor internal 
consistency is problematic as it indicates great proportions of measurement error, which 
constitutes an important threat to the reliability of instruments as well as to the replicability of 
results (Muis et al., 2006). A related issue is the overwhelming reliance on homogeneous 
samples, often composed of white, urban, undergraduate students, which threatens the reliability 
of self-report epistemic belief questionnaire (Greene & Yu, 2014; Mason, 2016). 
Lastly, using Likert-type questionnaires for the assessment of epistemic beliefs has been 
criticized for its potential inaccuracy. Greene et al. (2008) pointed out that completing an 
epistemic belief inventories requires a level of metacognitive engagement that participants may 
not be willing to deploy in an experimental context. This may compromise the accuracy of their 
responses. Similarly, researchers have raised concerns that there may be interpretability issues 
with items that are too broadly stated or worded with unspecific knowledge-related words 
(Greene & Yu, 2014; Muis et al., 2006). For instance, the item “I am most confident that I know 
something when I know what the experts think” (Hofer, 2000, p. 251) can be interpreted as 
asking whether sole reliance on experts is sufficient justification, or whether experts are a 
legitimate source of knowledge. Despite these limitations, Likert-scale questionnaires continue to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
34 
be prevalent in epistemic cognition research. As Greene et al. (2008) argued, self-report 
instruments can be adequate when used with large, heterogeneous samples, and when multiple 
items are used to capture one dimension from different angles.  
Scholars have proposed several solutions to address these measurement issues. In 
response to the identification of problems with psychometric factorial structures and internal 
consistency of instruments (e.g., Clarebout et al., 2001; DeBacker et al., 2008; Wood & Kardash, 
2002), as well as to the issue of wording in relation to domain-specificity, new instruments have 
been developed, such as the TSEBQ (Bråten et al., 2009) or the CAEB (Stahl & Bromme, 2007). 
Others have conducted qualitative investigations to assess whether there might be inherent 
conceptual problems with the frameworks from which self-report instruments are derived. 
Notably, as noted above, Greene and Yu (2014) interviewed novices and experts about their 
epistemic beliefs and identified various conceptual issues that might be problematic for 
measurement. Lastly, scholars have questioned whether self-report instruments may simply be 
inadequate to capture epistemic cognition (Alexander et al., 2012; Greene et al., 2010; Muis et 
al., 2006). This hypothesis has led to consider alternative methods, which are discussed next. 
Think-aloud protocols. One methodological approach that has gained traction over the 
past decades is think-aloud protocols (Ericsson & Simon, 1993). Think-aloud protocols involve 
asking participants to verbalize their thinking as they learn or study, thus allowing researchers to 
capture processes that are concurrent with learning without relying on participants’ memory. 
These verbal data are then categorized for a range of cognitive processes using coding schemes, 
which allows to quantify these processes. Given these characteristics, think-aloud protocols may 
be considered a quantitative methodology. Researchers have used think-aloud protocols to 
capture “epistemic beliefs in action” (e.g., Hofer, 2004a; Mason et al., 2010; 2011) as well as 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
35 
other contextualized aspects of epistemic cognition such as epistemic strategies and epistemic 
aims (e.g., Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Chevrier et al., 2016; Greene et al., 2015).. 
Contrary to Likert-type self-report questionnaires, which are completed before or after a 
cognitive task (i.e., offline measure), think-aloud protocols are another type of self-report 
measurement but offer online measurement, meaning that measures are taken as cognitive 
activity unfolds. Veenman, Van Hout-Wolters, and Afferbach (2006) have argued that in the 
context of measuring cognitive and metacognitive processes, online methods render data that are 
more predictive of learning achievement than offline methods. However, an important limitation 
to think-aloud protocols is that they may disrupt participants’ thinking process by imposing an 
additional cognitive demand (Veenman et al., 2006). Another issue is the resource intensiveness 
of think-aloud protocols, which require large investments of time (e.g., development of coding 
schemes, transcription and coding) and money (e.g., research assistants’ salary; participant 
compensation). Lastly, think-aloud is a self-report methodology and is subject to the same biases 
are other self-report methodologies, namely in that they are limited by how much participants are 
aware of their own mental processes.  
Qualitative methods. Qualitative methods used in epistemic cognition research have 
included, among others, phenomenological interviews (e.g., Baxter Magolda, 1992; Belenky et 
al., 1986; King and Kitchener, 1994; 2004; Perry, 1970), direct observation of classroom 
practices (e.g., Rosenberg, Hammer, & Phelan, 2006), multiple case study (e.g., Greene & Yu, 
2014), and the analysis of artifacts (e.g., Alexander et al., 2012). Cognitive interviews have also 
been used to elicit respondents’ interpretations of self-report items (e.g., Greene et al., 2010; 
Mason, 2016; Muis, Duffy, Trevors, Ranellucci, & Foy, 2014). Lastly, qualitative methods have 
been used to challenge some of the field’s conceptual assumptions. To this end, open-ended, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
36 
inductive, and exploratory work has been used to broaden the scope of dimensions, the types of 
justification, and the nature of sophisticated or expert epistemic cognition (Greene & Yu, 2014).  
Qualitative methods, however, are not without limitations. King and Kitchener (2002) 
argued that their own semi-structured interview (i.e., the Reflective Judgment Interview) might 
have resulted in an underestimation of respondents’ cognitive abilities, since it asked of students 
to respond to difficult questions with very little time to reflect. Another limitation comes from 
the fact that interview protocols are time-consuming, costly, and require specific training for 
research assistants, which explains why their use is typically limited to smaller samples. Lastly, 
when discussing the usefulness of artifacts (e.g., drawings, cognitive maps), Alexander et al. 
(2012) acknowledged that there is no way of knowing whether these artifacts reliably reflect 
students’ tacit beliefs. The authors also questioned the generalizability of findings derived from 
qualitative analyses by concluding that, “we simply cannot divorce these data from the context in 
which they were generated” (Alexander et al., 2012, p. 13). 
Future Directions and Conclusions 
 
As the field of epistemic cognition moves towards new methodologies, a few 
considerations must be taken into account. A first consideration consists of weighing 
participants’ lack of motivation to respond to questionnaires against maladaptive epistemic 
competence. If we accept the notion that epistemically competent individuals are flexible and 
take contextual demands into account, we can question the extent to which epistemically 
competent respondents would be motivated to deploy their “best” epistemic cognitive processes 
under experimental conditions. For instance, Hyytinen et al. (2014) found that among students 
who espoused more constructivist epistemic beliefs, many did not engage in thorough and 
effortful thinking on a reasoning task performed in an experimental context.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
37 
 
A second issue concerns sampling. We can wonder whether the field of epistemic 
cognition might have grown on the basis of evidence provided by samples that were overall too 
homogeneous. This concern dates back to Perry’s (1970) seminal work, which was based on a 
sample of all-white males from an elite institution. Since, samples used in epistemic cognition 
research have been overwhelmingly composed of white urban female university students. 
Despite the well-documented influence of the socio-cultural context on epistemic cognition 
(Bromme et al., 2008; Hammer & Elby, 2002; Muis et al., 2016) and its development (Hofer, 
2008; Muis et al., 2006), too little multicultural or socially diverse samples are used in epistemic 
cognition research. In addition, Hofer (2008) warns that the research conducted on cross-cultural 
samples has generally neglected to reconsider the assumptions, conceptualizations, and 
operational definitions of theories and methods used to apprehend these samples, which might 
not stand across cultures. 
 
Lastly, there is a need for instruments that can assess the epistemic climate of learning 
environments. Drawing from Muis et al. (2016), such a tool would capture and characterize the 
pedagogy, authoritative style, curriculum, evaluative practices, and support styles of a learning 
environment. Further, if researchers are to fulfill Bromme et al.’s (2010) call for a “double-track 
approach” (p. 23) to epistemic cognition research, artefact analysis with coding schemes should 
be used to analyze the knowledge representations to which learners are exposed. 
To conclude, it appears that the advancement of the quality of epistemic cognition 
measurement lies both in the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods (Mason, 2016), 
as well as in the development of new technologies (Greene et al., 2010). As new 
conceptualizations shed light on the many underlying facets of epistemic cognition, it is 
becoming increasingly important for researchers to clearly identify what is being measured, and 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
38 
to select methods accordingly. Indeed, instruments that have attempted to capture both the static 
and dynamic aspects of epistemic cognition might explain why these instruments have seldom 
correlated with each other (see DeBacker et al., 2008). Another promising avenue comes from 
technological advances, which bear the possibility of the stealth implementation of multi-modal 
measurement. Software such as nStudy (Winne, 2014) is promising in this regard: nStudy, is an 
online environment and research tool developed that allows researchers to gather traces of 
learners’ epistemic, affective,  and self-regulated processes as they occur in real time. However, 
as new technologies become the new center of interest, the resource intensivity of these 
sophisticated methods must be taken into consideration. As long as the field does not suggest 
methods that are non-invasive, inexpensive, and rapid to use, self-report instruments stand little 
chance of being replaced.  
In sum, accurate measurement of epistemic cognition is crucial for many reasons. 
Crucially, quick and non-invasive measurement of the components of epistemic cognition is key 
to realizing its full educational implications. On the other hand, precise measurement is key to 
advancing the field by relating epistemic cognition to other psychological and educational 
constructs, such construct is epistemic emotions.  
General Conclusion 
In a context of proliferating information and viewpoints, competent epistemic cognition 
is becoming a necessity for citizens of all ages. In the first section of this chapter, I have shown 
that the field of epistemic cognition has proposed frameworks that are increasingly specific, 
expansive, interdisciplinary, and integrated with other learning processes and outcomes, offering 
a fruitful avenue to better understand the nature and role of epistemic cognition for important 
educational processes and outcomes. Specifically, I have articulated conceptual distinctions 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
39 
between various epistemic terms (e.g., epistemic cognition, epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, 
epistemic strategies, epistemic emotions) that hold the promise of providing a fuller account of 
epistemic cognition if duly taken into account. In the second portion of this chapter, I have 
further shown that the field of epistemic cognition still suffers from methodological challenges 
and have identified the limitations but also the affordances of methods that can guide future 
research on epistemic cognition.  
Promising avenues for future work were also identified, including the investigation of 
mediation mechanisms that intervene in the relationship between epistemic cognition and 
important educational outcomes, as well as the use of multi-modal and dynamic measurement 
methods to properly operationalize the aforementioned conceptual distinctions. Overall, I have 
made the argument that with careful consideration for conceptual and methodological 
shortcomings, future research will help us understand how epistemic cognition can be profitably 
leveraged to educate individuals who can effectively sift through today’s complex informational 
landscape and make adequate decisions about what to believe or what to do.

Bridging Text 
Chapter 2 presented a comprehensive and critical review of the literature on epistemic 
cognition. The objectives that guided that review were (1) to identify contemporary and 
integrated conceptualizations of epistemic cognition that best describe the phenomenon of 
epistemic cognition in complex informational situations, and (2) to identify affordances and 
limitations of methods employed to measure epistemic cognition that can best guide future 
research in advancing knowledge on epistemic cognition. On the basis of this review, it was 
identified that epistemic cognition is multifaceted and includes, in addition to epistemic beliefs, 
underexplored facets such as epistemic aims, epistemic strategies, and epistemic experiences, 
including epistemic emotions. Further, to advance research on epistemic cognition, two 
promising avenues were suggested. These included the investigation of mediation mechanisms to 
explain how epistemic cognition relates to important educational outcomes, and the use of 
sophisticated measurement methods to properly operationalize the aforementioned conceptual 
distinctions. 
 
The following chapter presents two empirical investigations that follow these avenues. 
For these studies, a think-aloud protocol was used to collect verbal data on epistemic cognition, 
epistemic emotions, and learning strategies. These verbal data were used to assess a novel set of 
cognitive appraisals that are proposed to serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions (Study 1), 
and to assess the immediate (Study 1) and general (Study 2) consequences of epistemic emotions 
on self-regulated learning strategies. In doing so, I sought to address the conceptual and 
methodological limitations identified above, namely in operationalizing the distinction between 
the different facets of epistemic cognition, thus making it possible to empirically examine the 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

relationship between epistemic beliefs and epistemic cognition, which constitutes one of the 
unique contributions of this chapter.

Abstract 
Across two studies, we evaluated a model that proposed relations between epistemic cognition, 
epistemic emotions, self-regulatory strategies, and learning of complex contradictory content. 
For Study 1, to capture epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-regulatory strategies, 
114 undergraduate students thought out loud while reading conflicting texts about climate 
change. Protocol analysis revealed that epistemic aims, epistemic congruity, and appraisals of 
novelty and complexity of information served as antecedents to epistemic emotions. State-
transition analyses revealed that curiosity increased the likelihood of metacognitive self-
regulation, and that surprise decreased the likelihood of rehearsal and increased the likelihood of 
critical thinking. For Study 2, participants reported epistemic beliefs, read contradictory texts 
about climate change, reported emotions experienced while reading, and completed a knowledge 
assessment task. Path analyses revealed full mediation between epistemic beliefs, epistemic 
emotions, learning strategies and learning achievement. More constructivist beliefs about the 
complexity, uncertainty and justification of knowledge predicted more curiosity, less surprise, 
and less boredom. Curiosity, in turn, predicted critical thinking, knowledge elaboration and 
rehearsal strategies. Finally, critical thinking and rehearsal positively predicted learning 
achievement. Implications for research on epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-
regulated learning are discussed.  
 
Keywords: epistemic emotions, epistemic cognition, learning strategies, learning achievement.

1. Introduction 
Understanding the socio-scientific issues we face today is of critical importance, as 
citizens are called upon to make decisions about these increasingly pressing matters. Issues such 
as the benefits of genetically modified organisms, the risks associated with childhood vaccines, 
or the causes and consequences of climate change have emerged as some of the most complex 
and controversial topics (Funk & Kennedy, 2016; Hulme, 2009; Kata, 2012; Weber & Stern, 
2011). In educational settings, students’ understanding of socio-scientific topics is complicated 
by a set of social and psychological factors. First, such topics are often challenging to understand 
given their complex nature (e.g., Weber & Stern, 2011). To successfully learn about socio-
scientific topics, learners need to engage in skilled self-regulated learning, which includes 
setting learning goals, using strategies, and closely monitoring progress towards learning goals. 
Second, the falsely balanced media coverage of socio-scientific topics (Boykoff & Boykoff, 
2004) can result in erroneous conceptions about these topics, like the belief that there exists a 
connection between vaccination and autism (Kata, 2012) or the belief that climate change is not 
caused by mankind’s activities (Corbett & Durfee, 2004). As such, individuals need to engage in 
epistemic cognition to evaluate and select reliable sources of information, judge knowledge 
claims, and integrate divergent perspectives.  
Third, socio-scientific topics are often rife with emotions, especially when students are 
confronted with learning content that exposes uncertainty and controversy about these topics 
(Broughton, Pekrun, & Sinatra, 2012; Heddy, Danielson, Sinatra, & Graham, 2017). Previous 
research has shown that when learning about a topic such as climate change, students can be 
driven more by affect and values than by evidence (Slovic, 1987) and respond to uncertainty in 
ways that are more emotional than analytic (Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch, 2001). An

58 
emerging body of literature suggests that emotions are a critical component of learning about 
controversial socio-scientific topics (Muis et al., 2015; Muis & Singh, 2018). Recently, Muis et 
al. (2015) put forth a framework of epistemic emotions where they propose that individuals’ 
epistemic beliefs, i.e., beliefs about knowledge and knowing, predict the kinds of epistemic 
emotions (emotions that arise as a function of the cognitive qualities of information and the 
processing of that information [Pekrun & Stephens, 2012]) experienced during complex learning. 
For example, learners who espouse epistemic beliefs that are different from the epistemology of 
science (e.g., who believe that knowledge is simple and certain) may experience confusion, 
anxiety, or frustration when they encounter complex and conflicting scientific knowledge. In 
contrast, those who believe that knowledge is complex and evolving may experience curiosity 
and enjoyment. These epistemic emotions may then facilitate or constrain self-regulated 
learning. Given these implications, there are pressing questions with regard to the impact of 
epistemic emotions when learning about complex socio-scientific topics, particularly when 
knowledge is presented as controversial or contradictory. 
Bieg, Goetz, and Hubbard (2013) argued that one productive way to advance this line of 
research is by investigating the antecedents of emotions, as they can inform the development of 
interventions designed to foster positive emotions in the classroom. Further, to fully understand 
the role of epistemic emotions in self-regulated learning, Muis and colleagues (2015) 
recommended examining how learners immediately attend and respond to emotions as learning 
unfolds. As such, the primary purpose of this research was to respond to these calls and extend 
Muis et al.’s (2015) framework by investigating the antecedents and consequences of epistemic 
emotions on learning processes and outcomes during complex learning. In the following section, 
we review relevant theoretical and empirical work that guided the hypotheses of the current

study.  
2. Theoretical Frameworks 
2.1. Epistemic Cognition 
Individuals’ thoughts and beliefs about knowledge and knowing have been a popular line 
of inquiry among educational psychologists. Research in this field has largely focused on 
individuals’ beliefs about knowledge and knowing, i.e., epistemic beliefs. Epistemic beliefs are 
typically described as multidimensional and ranging from a less constructivist viewpoint to a 
more constructivist viewpoint along four dimensions. Hofer and Pintrich (1997) defined four 
dimensions of epistemic beliefs: (1) the certainty of knowledge, ranging from the belief that 
knowledge is certain to the belief that knowledge is tentative; (2) the simplicity of knowledge, 
ranging from the belief that knowledge is as simple as a list of facts, to the belief that knowledge 
is more like a complex network of interrelated propositions; (3) the source of knowledge, 
ranging from the belief that knowledge is handed down by authority, to the belief that knowledge 
is actively constructed through reason and logic; and, (4) the justification for knowing, ranging 
from the belief that knowledge is unquestionably justified through authoritative or expert 
sources, to the belief that knowledge is justified by rules of inquiry, including the critical 
evaluation of claims and the integration of multiple perspectives. Typically, more constructivist 
epistemic beliefs have been empirically linked to greater academic performance compared to less 
constructivist epistemic beliefs (Schommer, Crouse, & Rhodes, 1992) via use of learning 
strategies (Schommer, 1990). Specifically, learners who espouse more constructivist epistemic 
beliefs are more likely to use deep learning strategies, such as knowledge elaboration and critical 
thinking, whereas those who espouse less constructivist epistemic beliefs are more likely to 
resort to shallow learning strategies, such as rehearsal (Muis, 2007).

A growing body of literature emphasizes a wider set of cognitive processes associated 
with the nature of knowledge and the process of knowing that help to deal with controversial 
information. These include processes such as setting epistemic aims for learning, as well as using 
epistemic strategies to evaluate and integrate sources of information or establish justification for 
knowing. Together with epistemic beliefs, these processes constitute facets of epistemic 
cognition (Greene, Azevedo, & Torney-Purta, 2008; Greene, Sandoval, & Bråten, 2016; 
Kitchener, 1983; Muis & Singh, 2018). Specifically, Chinn, Buckland and Samarapungavan 
(2011) define epistemic aims as learning goals related to knowledge construction or problem 
solving that range from the aim to obtain simple and certain answers to the aim to acquire 
justified beliefs. Epistemic aims are attained via the use of epistemic strategies. Similar to 
learning strategies described in models of self-regulated learning (Greene & Azevedo, 2009; 
Winne & Hadwin, 1998), epistemic strategies are a subcategory of learning strategies that draw 
on epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge to address knowledge- and knowing-related issues 
(Richter & Schmid, 2010). Epistemic strategies include, for instance, sourcing strategies (i.e., 
evaluating the trustworthiness of sources [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Strømsø, Bråten, & Britt, 
2010]), justification strategies (i.e., evaluating whether knowledge claims are well justified; 
providing reasons for evidence [Greene et al., 2014; Richter & Schmid, 2010]), and integration 
strategies (i.e., comparing and contrasting multiple sources; providing explanation for 
differences between various perspectives [Barzilai & Zohar, 2012; Bråten, Britt, Strømsø, & 
Rouet, 2011; Kienhues, Stadler, & Bromme, 2011]). As such, epistemic cognition draws on 
epistemic beliefs to deploy epistemic strategies directed at epistemic aims. 
There is a growing body of evidence attesting to the importance of adaptive epistemic 
cognition for learning outcomes, including multiple-text comprehension (Bråten, Britt, Strømsø, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
61 
& Rouet, 2011), digital literacy (Strømsø & Kammerer, 2016), and critical thinking (Greene & 
Yu, 2016), among others. However, a recent meta-analysis by Greene, Cartiff and Duke (2018) 
has shown that the effect of epistemic cognition (measured predominantly as epistemic beliefs) 
on learning achievement is significant but small, r = .162. One possible explanation for this small 
effect may be the existence of mediators that intervene in the relationship between epistemic 
cognition and learning. Indeed, as Bråten et al. (2011) argued, much more research is needed to 
understand the mediational mechanisms by which epistemic cognition relates to learning 
processes and outcomes. They further note that emotions may be one such mediator. If 
researchers are to expand conceptualizations of epistemic cognition to include a broader range of 
epistemic processes, it is imperative that we also consider the emotions that directly relate to 
knowledge and knowing, such as curiosity or confusion (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993). As 
such, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic emotions may mediate relations between 
epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning. We next delineate the construct of epistemic 
emotions. 
2.2. Epistemic Emotions 
Emotions are pervasive in academic contexts and are posited to affect individuals’ 
learning and achievement (Op’t Eynde, De Corte, & Verschaffel, 2007; Perkun & Perry, 2014). 
In his control-value theory of achievement emotions, Pekrun (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Perry, 
2014) proposed that appraisals of perceived control and subjective task value serve as 
antecedents to emotions in academic contexts. Within this framework, emotions are categorized 
according to their valence and level of activation. In terms of valence, positive (i.e., pleasant) 
emotions such as enjoyment or pride can be distinguished from negative (i.e., unpleasant) 
emotions such as anxiety or frustration. Further, the level of activation generated by emotions 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
62 
also serves as an important distinction, which contrasts activating emotions, such as anxiety and 
anger, with deactivating emotions, such as contentment or boredom. Academic emotions can 
further be grouped according to their object focus (Pekrun, 2006): achievement emotions relate 
to success or failure of an achievement task; topic emotions relate to the content of what is being 
learned; social emotions are turned towards others and include, for instance, envy and 
admiration. Recently, educational psychologists have taken interest in a fourth category of 
academic emotions, that is, epistemic emotions. We define epistemic emotions as emotions that 
have, as an object focus, the knowledge-generating aspects of learning that arise as a result of 
cognitive and epistemic qualities of information and the processing of that information (Brun & 
Kuenzle, 2008; Morton, 2010; Muis, Chevrier, & Singh, 2018; Muis et al., 2015; Pekrun & 
Stephens, 2012). In the context of complex and conflicting knowledge, epistemic emotions may 
include surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, frustration, anxiety, and boredom (Muis et al. 
2015; Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017). 
Surprise involves the perception of a discrepancy between incoming information and 
prior knowledge, expectations, or beliefs (Scheffler, 1977). Discrepancies are events that cause 
cognitive disequilibrium, which D’Mello and Graesser (2012) define as a state of uncertainty that 
occurs when individuals are confronted with impasses, contradictions, anomalous events, 
dissonance or incongruities. Individuals may experience surprise when they encounter 
information that they did not expect (Meyer, Reisenzein, & Schützwhol, 1997; Reisenzein & 
Studtmann, 2007) or that they cannot explain (Foster & Keane, 2015). According to Munnich 
and Ranney (2018), surprise serves as a metacognitive signal of the level of difficulty of 
integrating surprising information to an existing mental representation. They suggest that when 
surprise has a low intensity, individuals may readily assimilate new information into current 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
63 
mental structures. However, when surprise is high, discrepant information may be treated as an 
anomaly or regarded as implausible, possibly resulting in a rejection of the information. Low-
intensity surprise may be experienced as pleasant whereas high-intensity surprise may be 
experienced as unpleasant; as such, surprise is considered a neutral emotion. 
Curiosity, on the other hand, arises out of an information gap or a discrepancy between 
what one knows and what one wants to know, and may motivate individuals to seek, obtain, and 
make use of new knowledge (Berlyne, 1954; Litman, 2005; Loewenstein, 1994). Silvia (2010) 
proposed that curiosity arises when discrepant information is perceived as highly novel and 
complex, yet comprehensible. Litman and colleagues (Litman, 2005; 2008; Lauriola, Litman et 
al., 2015) describe two types of dispositional tendencies to experience and express epistemic 
curiosity: an interest type and a deprivation type. Interest-type curiosity is described as a desire 
for new information that is expected to increase pleasant feelings of situational interest, whereas 
deprivation-type curiosity is defined as a motive to reduce the unpleasant experience of 
uncertainty or knowledge deprivation. As such, curiosity can be experienced as either pleasant or 
unpleasant and therefore, like surprise, can be considered a neutral emotion. Empirical studies 
have systematically found that curiosity positively relates to learning, including exploratory 
behaviors and greater learning (Berlyne, 1954; Litman, 2005; Loewenstein, 1994; Lowry & 
Johnson, 1981), with deprivation-type curiosity leading to even higher levels of exploration than 
interest-type curiosity (Litman, Hutchins & Russon, 2004). While calls have been made to 
include and distinguish both interest-type and deprivation-type curiosity in emotion research 
(e.g., Jirout & Klahr, 2012), for the current study, we conceptualize and measure the interest type 
of curiosity.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
64 
Confusion is conceived as resulting from appraisals of uncertainty stemming from 
novelty, complexity, conflict, or unfamiliarity (Ellsworth, 2003). When discrepant information is 
highly novel and complex, and also highly incomprehensible, confusion may arise (Silvia, 2010). 
D’Mello and Graesser (2012) argue that confusion is central to complex learning activities such 
as problem-solving and generating cohesive arguments. Confusion is expected to be beneficial to 
learning because it can help individuals focus attention on the anomaly or discrepancy, and 
motivate learners to effortfully deliberate, problem solve, and restructure their cognitive 
structures to resolve the confusion.  
When confusion is resolved, epistemic enjoyment may ensue (D’Mello & Graesser, 
2012). Enjoyment is a positive emotion that can further be experienced when curiosity is 
satisfied (Litman & Jimerson, 2004), problems are solved, or inductively formed hypotheses are 
successfully validated (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008). When problems cannot be solved, lasting 
confusion may transition into epistemic frustration if the focus is on the lack of resolution 
(D’Mello & Graesser, 2012). Similar to confusion, frustration is a negative activating emotion, 
but is unlikely to yield any of the learning benefits associated with confusion (D’Mello & 
Graesser, 2012). Indeed, frustration is an intense emotion that can overtake the cognitive system 
(Rosenberg, 1998), leaving learners with little cognitive energy for deep or creative problem 
solving. Another negative activating emotion is anxiety. Epistemic anxiety can arise when new 
information is highly inconsistent with prior knowledge or with one’s beliefs. When individuals 
begin to doubt their beliefs, epistemic anxiety may ensue. High anxiety can be detrimental to 
learning, but philosophers argue that doubt about one’s propositions is necessary to motivate 
learners to “struggle after belief” and into inquiry (Pierce, 1992, p. 115; see also Hookway, 
2008). Lastly, boredom is a negative deactivating emotion related to low arousal, low 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
65 
motivation, and a desire to escape the situation (Hubbard, 2019). Different types of boredom are 
described by Goetz, Frenzel, Hall, Nett, Pekrun, and Lipnevich (2014), including indifferent, 
calibrating, searching, reactant, and apathetic boredom, which reflect not only different 
intensities of boredom, but also a different motivational experience associated with coping with 
boredom. Epistemic boredom, specifically, is likely to arise when unsuccessful attempts at 
problem-solving turn persistent frustration into disengagement (D’Mello & Graesser, 2012).  
Epistemic emotions represent a type of emotion that is understudied relative to other 
academic emotions such as test anxiety (Zeidner, 1998). However, epistemic emotions are 
posited to serve important functions in learning, as delineated above. Given these implications, it 
is crucial to better understand the role that epistemic emotions may play in facilitating or 
constraining learning, and how these emotions relate to other facets of epistemic cognition, such 
as epistemic beliefs. Muis and colleagues (2015) proposed a model that threads together theories 
of self-regulated learning, epistemic beliefs, and epistemic emotions. We next present Muis et 
al.’s (2015) integrated model. 
2.3. Muis et al.’s (2015) Cognitive Incongruity Model 
To explain the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition and self-regulated 
learning, Muis et al. (2015) proposed a theoretical model that situates epistemic emotions as a 
mediational mechanism between epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning. The model 
described by Muis et al. (2015) applies to complex learning situations, that is, situations that 
require a complex coordination of cognitive, metacognitive, affective and motivational processes 
to reason, problem solve, integrate information, or draw reasonable conclusions. Adding to 
perceived control and task value as antecedents to emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Perry, 
2014), Muis and colleagues (2015) proposed that epistemic beliefs may be a logical antecedent 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
66 
to epistemic emotions given the focus of these emotions on knowledge and knowing. Broadly, 
Muis and colleagues’ model embeds two chief hypotheses: first, that epistemic beliefs, serve as 
one antecedent to epistemic emotions; and second, that epistemic beliefs predict self-regulated 
learning via epistemic emotions. Muis et al.’s (2015) predictive model is illustrated in Figure 1.  
Muis et al. (2015) proposed that learning about a complex and controversial socio-scientific topic 
that presents conflicting claims is a context that can make salient the complex and uncertain 
nature of scientific knowledge. Engaging in such a context activates learners’ epistemic beliefs 
(Muis, 2007) and triggers appraisals of epistemic congruity whereby learners evaluate the 
characteristics of information against the backdrop of their epistemic beliefs. For example, a 
learner who believes that knowledge is complex, tentative, actively constructed, and justified via 
critical thinking (i.e., more constructivist epistemic beliefs) should experience epistemic 
congruity1 when presented with multiple or seemingly divergent perspectives on an issue. Muis 
et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic congruity contributes to the arousal of positive epistemic 
emotions like interest-type curiosity and enjoyment. Inversely, an individual who believes that 
knowledge is simple, certain, passively constructed and justified via personal experience or 
unevaluated evidence (i.e., less constructivist epistemic beliefs) should experience epistemic 
incongruity when encountering conflicting claims and perspectives. Epistemic incongruity is a 
state of dissonance that may pose a threat to a learner’s epistemic identity (Bendixen & Rule, 
2004) and trigger surprise and negative emotions like confusion, anxiety, frustration, or 
boredom. To illustrate, a learner who believes that knowledge is simple and certain, and that 
knowledge claims are justified via direct observation or handed down from authorities may be 
surprised or confused when presented with complex and conflicting scientific claims on a 
scientific topic. The incongruence between beliefs and context may be ignored at first; however, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
67 
if the learner is repeatedly exposed to discrepant information, the learner’s beliefs may be shaken 
and anxiety may arise (Bendixen & Rule, 2004). Frustration may occur when an epistemic 
perspective is perceived as unacceptable, and boredom may ensue when prolonged frustration 
turns into disengagement (D’Mello et al., 2014). Inversely, an individual who believes that 
knowledge is complex and tentative, and that knowledge claims are formed of multiple 
perspectives and justified via an inquiry process, is likely to experience epistemic congruence 
when reading complex and conflicting scientific information. They may feel curious when 
encountering new information or experience joy when epistemic aims are achieved. 
Muis et al. (2015) proposed that epistemic emotions predict learning strategies and, in 
turn, learning achievement. On the basis of prominent models of self-regulated learning (Winne, 
2001; Muis, 2007) and empirical research on learners’ self-regulated learning strategies during 
complex learning (Azevedo, Cromley, & Seibert, 2004; Greene & Azevedo, 2009), we consider 
deep learning strategies as those that involve learners’ attempts to integrate new ideas with prior 
knowledge (i.e., knowledge elaboration), evaluate and integrate ideas (i.e., critical thinking), or 
metacognitively engage (e.g., self-questioning, making judgments of learning, monitoring 
strategy use) in flexible and creative ways. In contrast, we consider shallow learning strategies as 
more rigid strategies that lead to superficial processing of information, like simple rehearsal for 
memorization. This classification is consistent with Muis et al.’s (2015) work and other 
empirical work on self-regulated learning and conceptual change (e.g., Dole & Sinatra, 1998; 
Franco et al., 2012; Pintrich et al., 1991; Stathopoulou & Vosniadou, 2007). For relations 
between epistemic emotions and learning strategies, Muis et al. (2015) proposed that curiosity 
and enjoyment facilitate the use of deep learning strategies, whereas negative activating 
emotions such as anxiety and frustration lead to shallow learning strategies (see Pekrun & 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
68 
Stephens, 2012 for a review of supporting evidence). Further, surprise and confusion should 
relate to metacognitive self-regulation, and a deactivating emotion like boredom should impair 
the use of any learning strategies. Finally, for relations between learning strategies and learning 
achievement, following previous research (Franco et al., 2012; Greene & Azevedo, 2009), Muis 
et al. (2015) proposed that deep learning strategies are more likely to positively predict learning 
outcomes, whereas shallow learning strategies are more likely to negatively predict learning 
outcomes.  
 
Muis et al. (2015) conducted an empirical study to test their theoretical framework. Four 
hundred thirty-nine undergraduate students from large universities across three countries first 
took a prior knowledge test on climate change, reported their epistemic beliefs about climate 
change on the Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (TSEBQ; Bråten & Strømsø, 
2009), then read four conflicting texts on the topic of climate change. After reading each text, 
learners reported emotions experienced during reading on the Epistemic Emotions Scales (EES; 
Pekrun, Vogl, Muis, & Sinatra, 2017). After studying all texts, participants reported learning 
strategies used on the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ: Pintrich, Smith, 
Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993), and then completed a knowledge verification task to measure 
learning achievement. Results showed that a belief in complex knowledge predicted lower levels 
of confusion, anxiety, and boredom, and a belief in tentative knowledge predicted lower levels of 
anxiety and frustration. Further, a belief in the active construction of knowledge predicted lower 
levels of confusion. Lastly, a belief in the justification for knowing via critical evaluation 
predicted higher levels of enjoyment and curiosity, and lower levels of boredom. Counter to their 
hypotheses, surprise was not predicted by any belief dimension. For relations between epistemic 
emotions and learning strategies, results showed that curiosity and enjoyment predicted critical 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
69 
thinking, knowledge elaboration, and metacognitive self-regulation, and anxiety and frustration 
predicted simple rehearsal. Boredom was negatively related to all learning strategies.  
However, a few counter-hypothetical results were observed, namely that confusion 
positively predicted metacognitive self-regulation and that surprise negatively predicted critical 
thinking. In terms of relations between learning strategies and learning achievement, both critical 
thinking and knowledge elaboration positively predicted learning achievement. Counter to 
predictions, metacognitive self-regulation negatively predicted learning achievement. Overall, 
results showed that epistemic beliefs served as antecedents to epistemic emotions and these, in 
turn, mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. Moreover, 
unexpectedly, results showed that curiosity, enjoyment, and confusion predicted lower learning 
achievement via metacognitive self-regulation. Given a number of unexpected results, further 
empirical investigation into Muis et al.’s (2015) model is warranted.  
2.3.1 Proposed extensions to Muis et al.’s (2015) model 
2.3.1.1. Antecedents of epistemic emotions. Emotion appraisal theorists (Ellsworth & 
Scherer, 2003; Lazarus, 1991; Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, & Frijda, 2013) proposed that 
cognitive appraisals about how events in the world relate to one’s beliefs, goals, values or 
knowledge constitute the cause of an emotion. These appraisals are often quick and unconscious, 
but can also be less automated (Moors et al., 2013), and explain why individuals may experience 
very different emotions in response to similar stimuli (Ellsworth, 2013). Muis et al. (2015) 
proposed that appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions. 
Drawing from the literature on knowledge-related emotions, we propose two additional types of 
appraisals that may serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions: appraisals of information novelty 
and complexity and appraisals of achievement of epistemic aims (see Muis et al., 2018). First, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
70 
when they encounter information that is discrepant with prior knowledge or recently processed 
information, learners may appraise the extent to which new information fits with what they know 
or expect (i.e., appraisal of novelty). Further, individuals may appraise the extent to which they 
can understand new information (i.e., appraisals of complexity). When incoming information is 
deemed unexpected or unexplainable, surprise may arise (Foster & Keane, 2015; Meyer et al., 
1997). If learners judge that incoming information is not too complex and that they have the 
cognitive and metacognitive resources to resolve the discrepancy, curiosity may arise; however, 
if they judge that the information or task is too complex to be resolved, confusion may arise 
(D’Mello et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2009; Silvia, 2010). Second, following Muis (2007) and Chinn 
et al. (2011), individuals may set epistemic aims to apprehend to-be-learned knowledge and 
conduct appraisals of achievement of epistemic aims as learning unfolds. When epistemic aims 
are attained, enjoyment may arise (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008; Muis et al., 2018). However, if 
epistemic aims are blocked, individuals may experience surprise, confusion, frustration, anxiety, 
or boredom (D’Mello et al., 2014; Silvia, 2010). Although these mechanisms for emotional 
arousal have been proposed in the literature, we are the first to empirically examine whether 
appraisals of epistemic congruence, appraisals of information novelty and complexity, and 
appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims serve as antecedents to epistemic emotions. 
2.3.2.2. Consequences of epistemic emotions. Muis et al.’s (2015) model can be tested at 
a number of levels of granularity. Muis and colleagues tested whether epistemic beliefs reported 
before learning related to various epistemic emotions during learning, and to various learning 
strategies used over a learning session. It can be argued that this analysis constitutes a coarse 
level of granularity. At a finer level of granularity, the model predicts that specific cognitive 
appraisals serve as antecedents to specific epistemic emotions, and further predicts that these 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
71 
emotions have proximal consequences for the enactment of specific learning strategies. To test 
the model at this level, methods have to be used that allow the measurement of processes that are 
dynamic and changing at a fine level of granularity, such as online measures. 
According to Schraw (2010), online measures are measurements taken during learning, 
and can be contrasted with offline measures, which are measurements taken before or after 
learning. Online measures can gather data unobtrusively (e.g., reading times, trace logs) or 
require learners’ conscious attention (e.g., think-aloud protocols, inserted quiz). On the other 
hand, common offline measures include self-report questionnaires that use Likert-type scales to 
measure beliefs or behaviors. When it comes to epistemic beliefs, self-report instruments have 
been criticized for their low internal consistency (see DeBacker, Crowson, Beesley, Thoma, & 
Hestevold, 2008; Greene et al., 2008). The same can be said of self-regulated learning self-report 
instruments. Specifically, prior work has shown that learners are poor at reporting the actual 
frequency with which they use particular self-regulatory strategies (Kitchener, 1983; Winne, 
Jamieson-Noel, & Muis, 2002). To address these issues, researchers have suggested using trace 
methodologies such as think-aloud methods to capture traces of epistemic cognition and self-
regulated learning (Greene et al., 2010; Winne et al., 2002). Think-aloud protocols are said to 
provide rich information about online processes and further reveal the temporal deployment of 
processes as they unfold, one after the other (Charter, 2003; Schraw, 2010; Winne et al., 2002).  
There certainly exists another finer level of granularity at which Muis et al.’s (2015) 
model could be tested, namely by manipulating epistemic cognition and emotions to trigger the 
predicted transitions. However, before more systematic manipulations of antecedents can be 
tested, there is a need to clearly identify the antecedents of epistemic emotions and to explore 
transitions between emotions and cognition/metacognition as they spontaneously emerge. To fill 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
72 
this gap in the literature, we conducted research that we present as two studies: The first study 
explores the incidence of epistemic emotions as they naturally arise during learning of complex 
and conflicting knowledge, and the consequences of epistemic emotions for learning. The second 
study tests Muis et al.’s (2015) model using think-aloud data that reflects enacted self-regulatory 
processes during learning. We next present the research questions and hypotheses that guided our 
investigations.  
3. The Current Studies 
The purpose of the present research was to evaluate and extend Muis et al.’s (2015) 
integrated framework across two studies. The purpose of Study 1 was to explore the antecedents 
and consequences of epistemic emotions during learning of complex and conflicting knowledge. 
A first objective was to explore the role and relative importance of three proposed antecedents of 
epistemic emotions, and to assess whether variability in antecedents resulted in differential 
consequences for learning. A second objective was to explore the moment-to-moment 
consequences of epistemic emotions on learning processes by calculating the likelihood of state 
transitions. 
3.1. Study 1 Research Questions and Hypotheses 
For Study 1, we asked the following research questions: (1) What proportion of epistemic 
emotions are related to epistemic (in)congruity compared to information novelty and complexity, 
and the blockage or attainment of epistemic aims? (2) Do epistemic emotions increase the 
likelihood of a transition into subsequent learning strategies during learning? (3) Are there 
variations in these relations as a function of epistemic emotion antecedent?  
For Research Question 1, on the basis of reviewed literature, we hypothesized that 
appraisals of epistemic congruity, appraisals of information novelty and complexity, and 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
73 
appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims are antecedent to epistemic emotions. Given that 
no prior research has examined multiple antecedents of epistemic emotions in a single study, we 
did not have a specific hypothesis for the proportions in which these various antecedents may 
trigger epistemic emotions in the context of learning complex and conflicting knowledge. For 
Research Question 2, drawing from Muis et al.’s (2015) model, we hypothesized the following 
transitions (see Figure 1): curiosity and enjoyment will increase the likelihood of a transition into 
knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, or metacognitive self-regulation; frustration and anxiety 
will increase the likelihood of a transition into rehearsal; surprise and confusion will increase the 
likelihood of a transition into metacognitive self-regulation; and boredom will decrease the 
likelihood of a transition into any learning strategy. 
For transitions between epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition, previous theoretical 
and empirical work suggests that epistemic cognition may occur before and after epistemic 
emotions (see Muis et al., 2018). Recall that we define epistemic cognition as the activation of 
epistemic beliefs, the setting of epistemic aims and the use of epistemic strategies. According to 
Muis’s (2007) framework on the role of epistemic beliefs in self-regulated learning, epistemic 
beliefs are activated in the very first phase of self-regulated learning, as learners generate a task 
definition; epistemic beliefs are thus expected to arise temporally before epistemic emotions. 
Epistemic aims, like other learning goals, are set during the second phase of self-regulated 
learning, but can temporally occur at any point during learning, as phases are loosely sequenced 
(Muis, 2007). Given that no prior work has been conducted to examine whether epistemic 
emotions arise before or after epistemic aims are set, we did not have a hypothesis with regard to 
the temporal sequencing between epistemic aims and epistemic emotions. Lastly, like learning 
strategies, epistemic strategies arise during the enactment phase (third phrase) of Muis’s (2007) 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
74 
model of self-regulated learning. By analogy, we hypothesized that epistemic emotions may have 
consequences for the use of epistemic strategies. For instance, a learner who has activated the 
belief that scientific knowledge is complex, who then encounters conflicting claims may feel 
curious, set the epistemic aim to form justified knowledge on the topic, and use justification 
strategies to generate integrated knowledge. In sum, drawing from Muis’s (2007) model of 
epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning, and on the basis of the reasoning elaborated above, 
we hypothesized that epistemic cognition would increase the likelihood of a transition into 
epistemic emotions, and that epistemic emotions would increase the likelihood of a transition 
into epistemic cognition.  
Finally, for Research Question 3, we did not have a specific hypothesis, but sought to 
explore whether differences in subsequent states occurred as a function of epistemic emotion 
antecedent. This question was exploratory in nature as no prior work to date has empirically 
examined the relations between antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions.  
3.2 Study 2 Research Questions and Hypotheses 
In Study 2, we sought to verify whether results obtained by Muis et al. (2015) could be 
replicated by conducting a path analysis to test relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic 
emotions, learning strategies and learning achievement, using verbalized learning strategies 
instead of self-reported data. We formulated Research Question 4 as follows: What are the 
predictive relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, self-regulatory learning 
strategies, and learning achievement? Figure 1 presents Muis et al.’s (2015) hypothesized model, 
with prior knowledge included as a covariate.

75 
4.1.1. Participants  
One hundred fourteen undergraduate students from multiple disciplines (mathematics, 
science, engineering, psychology, education, business, among others) participated in this 
research. Participants were recruited from a large university in Canada through a classified 
advertisement system. They participated on a voluntary basis and received $15 as compensation. 
The sample was predominantly female (66.7 %, n = 76), white (54.4 %, n = 62), and English-
speaking (63.2 %, n = 72). Participants were 21.3 years of age (SD = 2.9) on average. 
4.1.2. Text materials 
To create a complex learning situation where issues of knowledge are at stake, we 
presented learners with four conflicting texts on the causes and consequences of climate change, 
in conflicting pairs. The four texts were adapted from Strømsø et al. (2010; see Appendix A). 
The first text presented climate change as manmade and was written by an academic researcher. 
The text contained 314 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level2 equivalent to grade 12. 
The second text presented climate change as caused by astronomical conditions and was written 
by a professor in astrophysics. It contained 324 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level 
equivalent to grade 10. The third text presented negative consequences of climate change with a 
geopolitical perspective and was written by a scientific journalist. It contained 356 words and 
had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level equivalent to grade 11. Finally, the fourth text presented 
positive consequences of climate change from an economical perspective and was written by a 
newspaper journalist. It contained 272 words and had a Flesch-Kincaid reading level equivalent 
to grade 12. The four texts were presented in a fixed linear order, as to make salient the 
conflicting nature of the texts. A pilot study was conducted with a sample of over 200 lay adults 
(no university students participated). The pilot was conducted online using a popular survey 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
76 
platform and was administered in part. Pilot data analysis revealed no effect of text order on 
outcomes variables of interest. 
4.1.3. Data sources 
 
4.1.3.1. Epistemic emotions. A think-aloud procedure was used to capture learners’ 
epistemic emotions in real time. Protocols were first transcribed verbatim, which resulted in 803 
pages (8687 lines) of text. The first author segmented each transcript into meaningful units of 
analysis, which consisted of a clause or sentence that enclosed a thought or idea. Each segment 
was then assigned a code, according to a coding scheme developed by the first three authors. The 
coding scheme was tested by the first three authors using three transcripts, and inter-rater 
reliability for the first round was established at 83%. All disagreements were resolved through 
discussion and were used to update the coding scheme. The first author then coded the remainder 
of the protocols. The third author then independently coded 15% of the remaining protocols 
coded by the first author, and final inter-rater reliability based on these protocols was established 
at 92%.  
 
The development of the coding scheme for epistemic emotions was based on the EES 
 (Pekrun et al., 2017) and, as such, focused on surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, 
frustration, anxiety, and boredom (see Table 1 for the complete coding scheme, including 
definitions and examples for each code). Emotions were further coded according to their object 
focus: Each emotion was classified as an epistemic, topic, achievement, or social emotion, 
according to Pekrun and Linnenbrink-Garcia’s (2012) classification. Words and sentences 
uttered before or after an emotion were considered to determine an emotion’s object focus. For 
instance, “The oil and gas deposits that are concealed there are estimated to amount to 30 per 
cent of the earth's deposits… Great! Now we can screw over the environment even more” was 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
77 
coded as topic frustration. In contrast, “This is pretty absurd, trying to find the positives in global 
warming by saying we’ll have access to more gas which we’ll then burn which will contribute 
further to global warming. This is a stupid article. It’s just kind of a strange view” was coded as 
epistemic frustration, where the learner is frustrated that the author presents such a perspective 
about climate change. 
 
Epistemic emotions were further classified according to their antecedents. Table 2 
includes descriptors and examples of epistemic emotions related to each antecedent. Words or 
sentences uttered before or after an emotion were taken into consideration to determine the type 
of appraisal that led to emotion arousal. For instance, “When particles that originate from 
previously exploded stars penetrate the atmosphere, they could affect the formation of low 
clouds. That’s kind of cool to know!” was coded as enjoyment related to information novelty. In 
contrast, “I mean, I like to learn about a different viewpoint,” was coded as enjoyment related to 
epistemic congruity.  
 
4.1.3.2. Learning strategies. Learning strategies were captured through a think-aloud 
procedure. Protocols were then coded for learning strategies, using a coding scheme developed 
for this purpose. The coding scheme incorporated the four macro-level learning strategies 
proposed in the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich, Smith, 
Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993), which Muis et al. (2015) had used to measure learning strategies in 
their original study: rehearsal, knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-
regulation. We also drew from Greene and Azevedo’s (2009) coding scheme for self-regulatory 
processes to generate more detailed descriptions for each learning strategy. For instance, the 
following micro-level processes were used to describe the macro-level code “metacognitive self-
regulation”: making judgments of learning, emitting feelings of knowledge, monitoring progress 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
78 
towards goal, and monitoring use of strategy. Lastly, we included “prior knowledge activation” 
and “re-reading” from Greene and Azevedo’s coding scheme as they were deemed relevant to 
the present learning task. The final coding scheme comprised six learning strategies, including: 
prior knowledge activation, rereading, rehearsal, knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, and 
metacognitive self-regulation (see Table 1 for the complete coding scheme, including definitions 
and examples for each learning strategy). For analyses, following others (e.g., Dole & Sinatra, 
1998; Pintrich et al., 1993; Stathopoulou & Vosniadou, 2007; Franco, et al., 2012) we grouped 
together learning strategies that required little cognitive manipulation (i.e., prior knowledge 
activation, rereading, rehearsal) as shallow learning strategies, and learning strategies that 
required more extensive cognitive manipulation (i.e., knowledge elaboration, critical thinking, 
metacognitive self-regulation) as deep learning strategies. 
 
4.1.3.3. Epistemic cognition. Epistemic cognition was captured via a think-aloud 
procedure. Protocols were coded for epistemic cognition using a coding scheme developed for 
this purpose. The development of the coding scheme was based on Greene et al.’s (2014) coding 
scheme for epistemic cognition (see Table 1 for a complete list of codes, definitions, and 
examples). Final categories included epistemic beliefs, epistemic aims, as well as epistemic 
strategies. Three classes of epistemic strategies were included: sourcing strategies, integration 
strategies, and justification strategies.  
4.1.4. Procedure 
 
This research was conducted in a laboratory setting, with the assistance of a trained 
experimenter. Participants first signed a consent form that included a statement of the purpose of 
research. Participants next completed a demographics questionnaire, a prior knowledge test (used 
as a covariate in Study 2; see section 4.3.1), and the Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
79 
Questionnaire (TSEBQ; Bråten & Strømsø, 2009) to capture learners’ epistemic beliefs (see 
section 4.3.2). Next, participants received instructions for the think-aloud protocol, as per 
Ericsson and Simon’s (1993) recommendations: Participants were asked to think out loud while 
reading and studying, that is, to say everything that they were thinking and doing. If participants 
remained silent for more than three seconds, they were prompted by the experimenter to keep 
talking. We did not specifically instruct participants to express their emotions out loud.  
A think-aloud practice was conducted prior to reading the experimental texts using two unrelated 
texts (approximately 150 words). After the practice texts, participants proceeded to reading the 
experimental texts. A blank space on the computer screen was reserved for note-taking while 
studying; however, participants were told they would not have access to their notes during the 
post-test. Participants were alerted to the conflicting nature of the task contained in the texts with 
the following information: “Two of the texts discuss the causes of climate change and were 
written by science experts. One expert claims that humans are responsible for climate change, 
whereas the other expert claims that changes to the climate are natural. The other two texts, 
written by journalists, focus on the pros and cons of climate change. Whereas one journalist 
reports on the pros of climate change, the other journalist reports on the cons of climate change.”  
After having read each of the first three texts, participants completed a short version of the EES 
(Pekrun et al., 2017). Participants then completed the full EES after having read the fourth 
experimental text and completed a post-test to measure learning achievement. When the study 
was over, participants were thanked and received compensation. Debriefing information was 
offered to all participants: The experimenter provided verbal definitions for epistemic beliefs and 
epistemic emotions as well as explanations as to the choices of text and their order of 
presentation. In total, the experiment lasted approximately one hour. Instructions were scripted to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
80 
ensure consistency in instructions across participants. For the purpose of Study 1, self-reported 
emotions and epistemic beliefs were not included in any analyses but were used for Study 2.  
4.1.5. Analytical approach 
 
To examine the consequences of epistemic emotions on cognitive and metacognitive 
learning processes, we conducted state-transition analysis to test for the likelihood of 
transitioning from a given emotional state to a subsequent learning strategy. State-transition 
analyses have been used in quantitative research to capture the temporal deployment of affective, 
cognitive and metacognitive states during learning (see Azevedo et al., 2010; D’Mello & 
Graesser, 2012; Poitras & Trevors, 2012; Witherspoon, Azevedo, & D'Mello, 2008). State-
transition analysis is performed by creating a matrix of all the possible states (here, we 
considered emotions, epistemic cognition, and learning strategies) and entering the number of 
times learners transitioned from one state to the next based on coded trace data, such as data 
from think-aloud protocols. This results in a state-transition table that can be used to calculate the 
probability of transitioning from one emotion to a subsequent state.  
 
The underlying assumption to our investigation is that emotions have consequences for 
learning processes and that this can be observed immediately after an epistemic emotion arises. 
We assumed that emotions and follow-up learning strategies were not independent from each 
other, such that the frequency with which a specific learning strategy followed a specific 
epistemic emotion would be greater than chance (i.e., if distributed randomly). To test whether a 
given transition occurred at a rate higher than chance, we created 2 x 2 contingency tables to 
compare the frequency distribution of specific transitions against a prior distribution of variables. 
We then conducted chi-squared tests to determine whether the likelihood of transitions was 
significantly greater than chance. For instance, suppose that across all participants, critical 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
81 
thinking was coded 100 times whereas other learning strategies were coded 900 times (for a total 
of 1000 learning strategies). Let us further suppose that frustration was followed by critical 
thinking 10 times across all participants, whereas frustration was followed by another learning 
strategy 90 times overall (for a total of 100 instances of frustration). The likelihood of critical 
thinking following frustration would then be equal to chance, given the prior distribution of 
frustration in the overall sample. However, for the same distribution of critical thinking, if 
frustration was followed by critical thinking 50 times and followed by another emotion 50 times, 
a transition from frustration to critical thinking would then by significantly greater than chance, 
as would be reflected by a significant chi-squared test.   
 4.2. Results 
 
4.2.1. Antecedents of epistemic emotions  
 
Prior to addressing Research Question 1, which concerned the antecedents of epistemic 
emotions, we first identified segments that represented meaningful emotions, epistemic 
cognition, or learning strategies, which resulted in 3301 coded segments. We then examined the 
object focus of each emotion to determine its type (i.e., achievement, social, epistemic, or topic). 
As shown in Table 3, think-aloud protocols contained a total of 267 instances of emotions: 
77.53 % (n = 207) were epistemic emotions, 19.48 % (n = 52) were topic emotions, and 3 % (n = 
8) were achievement emotions. Emotions with an epistemic focus included surprise (n = 86; 
41.55 %), curiosity (n = 92; 44.44 %), enjoyment (n = 7; 3.38 %), confusion (n = 16; 7.73 %), 
and frustration (n = 6; 2.89 %). No instances of epistemic anxiety or epistemic boredom were 
identified; all instances of anxiety were topic anxiety, and all instances of boredom were 
achievement boredom.  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
82 
 
We further classified epistemic emotions according to their antecedents (i.e., type of 
appraisal) and calculated the proportions in which each type of appraisal related to epistemic 
emotions. Table 4 shows that across 207 instances of epistemic emotions, 22.22 % (n = 46) were 
related to appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity, 76.81 % (n = 159) were related to appraisals of 
information novelty and complexity, and .97 % (n = 2) were related to the attainment of 
epistemic aims. Specifically, 10.46 % (n = 9) of instances of surprise related to epistemic 
(in)congruity, as did 31.52 % (n = 29) of instances of curiosity, 12.50 % (n = 2) of instances of 
confusion, and 100 % (n = 6) of instances of epistemic frustration. Moreover, 89.53 % (n = 77) 
of instances of surprise were related to information novelty and complexity, as were 68.48% 
(n = 63) of instances of curiosity and 87.50% (n = 14) of instances of confusion. Lastly, 28.57 % 
(n = 2) of instances of enjoyment related to epistemic aims. In response to our first research 
question, results showed that a greater proportion of epistemic emotions related to information 
novelty and complexity than to epistemic (in)congruity, and only a small proportion of epistemic 
emotions related to epistemic aims.  
 
4.2.2. Transitions between epistemic emotions and learning strategies 
 
To address Research Question 2, which concerned the sequential dynamics between 
epistemic emotions and other cognitive and metacognitive learning processes, we conducted 
state-transition analyses on the basis of the distribution of epistemic emotions, learning 
strategies, and epistemic cognition across think-aloud protocols. Table 5 presents the frequency 
of epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and epistemic cognition in think-aloud protocols. 
Table 6 presents the frequency of transitions from an epistemic emotion to all possible follow-up 
states. We considered learners’ continued engagement with the learning material as a valid 
subsequent state (“continues to read”). To examine transitions from epistemic emotions to a 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
83 
subsequent learning strategy, we created multiple 2 x 2 contingency tables (Tables 7, 8, and 9) to 
test for statistical differences between observed frequencies and expected frequencies (see 
Section 4.1.5). Because chi-squared tests assume at least five cases in each cell, we could only 
test the statistical significance of transitions from curiosity and surprise to subsequent learning 
strategies. For transitions from curiosity to a subsequent learning strategy, we identified a trend 
that was approaching statistical significance that showed that curiosity was followed by 
metacognitive self-regulation more often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 3.62, p = .057, as 
displayed in Table 7. Examples of this sequence included: “That’s interesting [curiosity]. I didn’t 
know that temperature dropping was a concern of global warming [metacognitive self-
regulation]”, and “I find this really interesting [curiosity], because I never really hear about 
positive effects of global warming, I always hear about the negative effects [metacognitive self-
regulation]”. These results are aligned with our hypothesis.  
 
For transitions from surprise to a subsequent learning strategy, results showed that 
surprise was followed by rehearsal significantly less often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 
4.54, p = .033, as displayed in Table 8. Further, results showed that surprise was followed by 
critical thinking significantly more often than statistically expected, c2(1) = 14.56, p < .001, as 
displayed in Table 9. An example of this sequence included: “Wow… [surprise] It’s putting 
people in danger basically more… And it’s probably going to keep rising as we go along if 
nothing really changes [critical thinking]” and “[A number of oceanographers fear highly 
uncomfortable side effects due to global warming…] What? Haha! [surprise] I think ‘highly 
uncomfortable’ is an understatement. People are going to die and like entire places where people 
live are going to be like under the ocean soon. I think that’s more than uncomfortable [critical 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
84 
thinking].” Although this finding was unexpected, it is consistent with previous research, as will 
be discussed later.  
4.2.3. Transitions between epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition 
As part of Research Question 2, we explored how epistemic emotions sequentially related 
to epistemic cognition during learning. Epistemic cognition was meaningfully related to 
epistemic emotions in 13 cases, out of the 366 instances of epistemic emotions. For all 13 
instances, epistemic cognition followed epistemic emotions. Two recurrent patterns were 
identified: an epistemic emotion was followed by a source evaluation (e.g., “Oh wow [surprise], 
another journalist [source evaluation]”), and an epistemic emotion was followed by an epistemic 
aim (e.g., “I find this very surprising [surprise] and I say I want to learn a lot more about it 
[epistemic aim]”). As will be elaborated in the discussion, this result suggests that epistemic 
strategies may be consequences of epistemic emotions, whereas epistemic beliefs and epistemic 
aims may be better construed as antecedents of epistemic emotions. 
 
4.2.4. Variations in subsequent state as a function of epistemic emotion antecedent 
To address Research Question 3, we explored whether the consequences of epistemic 
emotions on learning strategies varied as a function of antecedent. For curiosity to metacognitive 
self-regulation transitions, we identified 11 occurrences. Of the 11 instances, curiosity related to 
appraisals of information novelty and complexity nine times, versus two instances where 
curiosity related to appraisals of epistemic (in)congruity. In total, curiosity was related to 
information novelty and complexity 68.48 % (n = 63) of the time, whereas it was related to 
epistemic (in)congruity 31.52 % (n = 29) of the time. This difference was non-significant, c2(1) 
= .91, p = .340. For surprise to rehearsal strategies transitions, we identified six occurrences. Of 
these six instances, surprise related to appraisals of information novelty and complexity five 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
85 
times whereas surprise was related epistemic (in)congruity only once. In total, surprise was 
related to information novelty and complexity 89.53 % (n = 77) of the time, whereas surprise 
related to epistemic (in)congruity 10.47 % (n = 9) of the time. This difference was non-
significant, c2(1) = 2.46, p = .620. For surprise to critical thinking transitions, we identified 18 
occurrences. Of the 18 instances, surprise was related to appraisals of information novelty and 
complexity 14 times, whereas surprise was related to epistemic (in)congruity four times. This 
difference was also non-significant, c2(1) = 2.67, p = .102, based on the distribution of surprise 
per antecedent in total. In light of these results, we inferred that the consequences of epistemic 
emotions on learning strategies were not a function of the type of appraisal that served as 
antecedent. These results are discussed in detail in the Discussion section. 
5. Study 2    
5.1. Method 
 
5.1.1. Participants 
 
The same sample was used for Study 2 as from Study 1 (see section 4.1.1.). 
 
5.1.2. Text materials 
 
All text materials were identical to Study 1 (see section 4.1.2.). 
 
5.1.3. Data sources 
5.1.3.1. Prior knowledge. Given established relations between prior knowledge and 
topic-specific epistemic beliefs (Bråten & Strømsø, 2009), we assessed learners’ prior 
knowledge about climate change to use as a covariate. A 15-item multiple-choice test was 
adapted from Bråten, Strømsø, and Samuelstuen (2008) to assess participants’ knowledge of 
content covered in the texts (see Appendix B). An example item was: “The greenhouse effect is 
due to (a) holes in the ozone layer, (b) increased use of nuclear energy, (c) increased occurrence 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
86 
of acidic precipitation, (d) streams of heat that do not get out of the atmosphere, or (d) the 
pollution of the oceans.” One point was awarded for each correct answer. The final score 
consisted of a sum out of a maximum of 15. Given that the prior knowledge test covered a range 
of topics, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the 15 items. Byrne (2005) 
recommends using EFA when researchers have no prior knowledge of the underlying factor 
structure of a measure, as opposed to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which is appropriate 
to use when a factor structure is hypothesized a priori on theoretical grounds. Maximum 
likelihood with varimax rotation was conducted. Four dimensions were identified, which 
accounted for 42.89% of the variance. The four dimensions resulted in Cronbach’s alphas of .63 
(two items), .71 (four items), .73 (four items) and .76 (five items). Correlations between each of 
the four dimensions of prior knowledge and the variables in the model were very similar (i.e., 
within one one-hundredth). As such, to simplify tables and figures, only one coefficient is 
reported but note that all four dimensions were used in the analyses as covariates. 
 
5.1.3.2. Epistemic beliefs. The TSEBQ was used to measure learners’ epistemic beliefs 
about climate change (see Appendix C). Six items assessed beliefs about the 
simplicity/complexity of climate change knowledge (e.g., “Knowledge about climate change 
consists of highly interrelated concepts rather than an accumulation of facts”); six items assessed 
beliefs about the certainty/uncertainty of climate change knowledge (e.g., “The results of climate 
research are preliminary”); five items assessed beliefs about the source of knowing about climate 
change  (e.g., “When I read about climate problems, I only stick to what the text expresses” 
[reversed]); and seven items assess beliefs about the justification for knowing about climate 
change (e.g., “To be able to trust knowledge claims in texts about issues concerning climate, one 
has to check various knowledge sources”). Participants rated items on a 10-point Likert scale, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
87 
where a score of 1 (“I completely disagree”) indicates less constructivist epistemic beliefs and a 
score of 10 (“I completely agree”) indicates more constructivist epistemic beliefs.  
Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using Mplus 7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012) revealed 
a poor fit of the data to the model (CFI = .87, RMSEA = .12, c2 = 613.49, df = 246, p < .001). 
Based on item loadings of less than |.30|, two items were removed from the 
simplicity/complexity scale, one was removed from the certainty/uncertainty scale, one was 
removed from the source scale, and one was removed from the justification scale. A second CFA 
revealed a good model fit (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .08, c2 = 377.89, df = 146, p < .001) (see Byrne, 
2011). Standardized factor loadings for all dimensions ranged from .31 to .85, with the majority 
above .54. Cronbach’s alphas were as follows: .76 for the uncertainty subscale, .74 for the 
complexity subscale, .78 for the justification subscale, and .74 for the source subscale. 
 
5.1.3.3. Epistemic emotions. The EES was used to measure participants’ epistemic 
emotions (see Appendix D). This questionnaire consisted of 21 items. Each item consisted of a 
single word describing one emotion, with three descriptors per emotion: surprise (e.g., 
“astonished”), curiosity (e.g., “inquisitive”), enjoyment (e.g., “happy”), confusion (e.g., 
“muddled”), frustration (e.g., “irritated”), anxiety (e.g., “nervous”), and boredom (e.g., 
“monotonous”). Participants were instructed to report emotions experienced while reading the 
texts. Participants rated each item on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 5 
(“Very strong”). The descriptors of each emotion were averaged to represent each emotion 
overall. Cronbach’s alpha for subscales (i.e., individual emotions) ranged from .73 to .87. 
 
5.1.3.4. Learning strategies. Learning strategies were captured via a think-aloud 
procedure3. Protocols were coded for learning strategies using a coding scheme developed for 
this purpose (see section 2.3.2). 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
88 
 
5.1.3.5. Learning achievement. To parallel Muis et al.’s (2015) study, we focused on 
text comprehension as a measure of learning achievement. Text comprehension of the four 
experimental texts was assessed with a 21-item intra-text inference verification task (Royer, 
Carlo, Dufresne, & Mestre, 1996) adapted from Strømsø et al. (2010; see Appendix E). Because 
this task requires that learners construct an accurate mental model of the content, it can be used 
to distinguish deeper situational understanding from mere text retention (Royer et al., 1996). 
Each item consisted of a sentence constructed by combining information from two or more 
sentences in an experimental text to form a valid or invalid inference. For example, the sample 
item “Global warming may result in both cooling in Northern Europe and a higher average 
temperature on the earth” was constructed by combining the following sentences from the third 
text: “Global warming may also weaken the Gulf Stream and result in serious cooling in 
Northern Europe” and “[…] namely that global warming will raise the earth’s average 
temperature.” Learners were instructed to evaluate whether each item represented a valid or 
invalid inference by indicating “Yes” or “No.” The test included 12 valid items and 9 invalid 
items that could be grouped into four subsets of questions that each related to one experimental 
text. One point was attributed for each correct answer, for a maximum of 21 points (scores were 
transformed into percentages for ease of interpretation). Reliability values were calculated for 
each subset of questions, and Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from .70 to .73.  
 
5.1.4. Procedure 
The procedure for Study 2 was the same as for Study 1.  
5.1.5. Analytical approach 
To test the mediation model presented in Figure 1, we used Hayes and Preacher’s (2013) 
PROCESS SPSS macro4. This macro is recommended for complex models as it controls for 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
89 
Type I errors while maintaining high levels of power with smaller sample sizes (see Preacher & 
Hayes, 2008). Additionally, the bootstrap sampling method has no underlying distributional 
assumptions and, as such, is appropriate with our data (i.e., the think-aloud data were skewed) 
(see Hayes, 2013). Path analyses with 10,000 bootstrap resamples were performed in two steps 
with 90% confidence intervals, as they are considered appropriate for tests of mediation 
(Preacher, Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010).  
5.2 Results 
 
5.2.1. Preliminary analyses 
 
Prior to conducting full analyses, each variable was examined for skewness, kurtosis, 
and outliers. All self-reported variables (i.e., epistemic beliefs and epistemic emotions) were 
within normal range, with absolute values of less than 3 for skewness and kurtosis (see 
Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). However, all learning strategies variables (collected via think-aloud 
protocols) were positively skewed. Further, rehearsal and metacognitive self-regulation data 
were leptokurtic. Given that these variables represent behavioral frequencies with meaningful 
zero points, no transformations were performed. Means and standard deviations for all self-report 
variables and knowledge assessments are reported in Table 10. Correlations between variables 
are presented in Table 11. 
 
5.2.2. Predictive relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, learning 
strategies, and learning achievement 
5.2.2.1 Effects of epistemic beliefs on epistemic emotions and learning strategies. To 
test for relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, enacted learning strategies (as 
gathered via think-aloud protocol) and achievement as depicted in Figure 1 (Research Question 
4), we conducted path analyses (see section 5.1.5) with the four prior knowledge subscales 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
90 
included as covariates for all variables. The final path model with significant standardized 
estimates is presented in Figure 2 (for simplicity, only one box is drawn for prior knowledge as 
path coefficients for all four subscale scores were equivalent). The first step in the analysis tested 
whether epistemic beliefs predicted epistemic emotions and learning strategies, with prior 
knowledge used as a covariate. The total effects model for this analysis was significant, F(5, 
101) = 3.45, p < .007, R2 = .15. As expected, belief in justification via inquiry positively 
predicted curiosity, b = .24, t = 2.51, p = .007, and enjoyment, b = .27, t = -2.85, p = .003, and 
negatively predicted frustration, b = -.16, t = - 1.64, p = .05, and boredom, b = -.24, t = -2.48, p = 
.005. Further, a belief in the source of knowledge via active construction negatively predicted 
anxiety, b = -.15, t = -1.74, p = .05. However, counter to predictions, results revealed that belief 
in complex knowledge negatively predicted surprise, b = -.17, t = 1.71, p = .05, uncertain 
knowledge positively predicted boredom, b = .21, t = 2.02, p = .023, and justification via inquiry 
positively predicted surprise, b = .17, t = 1.72, p = .04.  
For relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, as expected, a belief in 
the complexity of knowledge positively predicted knowledge elaboration, b = .29, t = 2.79, p = 
.006, and critical thinking, b = .24, t = 2.23, p = .010, and a belief in the justification of 
knowledge via inquiry positively predicted knowledge elaboration, b = .20, t = 2.16, p = .033 
and critical thinking, b = .16, t = 1.69, p = .050.  
5.2.2.2. Mediation effects of epistemic emotions between epistemic beliefs and learning 
strategies. The first step in the analysis was used to test whether epistemic emotions mediated 
relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies. Mediation analyses revealed that 
anxiety mediated relations between beliefs about the source of knowledge and knowledge 
elaboration, with a standardized point estimate of .04 and a 90% confidence interval of .002 to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
91 
.127. The mediation was full, as the direct effect was no longer significant once the mediator was 
included in the model (see Hayes [2013]). In line with Muis et al.’s (2015) model, this indicates 
that beliefs about the active construction of knowledge predicted less anxiety and, in turn, more 
knowledge elaboration.  
5.2.2.3. Effects of epistemic emotions on learning strategies and learning achievement. 
The second step in the analysis tested relations between epistemic emotions, learning strategies, 
and learning achievement. The total effects model was significant, F(2, 104) = 9.32, p < .001, 
R2 = .15, controlling for prior knowledge. For direct effects of epistemic emotions on learning 
strategies, as expected, curiosity positively predicted critical thinking, b = .16, t = 1.69, p = .04, 
and knowledge elaboration, b = .20, t = 2.06, p = .014. However, contrary to predictions, 
curiosity positively predicted rehearsal, b = .16, t = 1.61, p = .05. Further, results unexpectedly 
revealed that surprise negatively predicted critical thinking, b = -.18, t = -1.73, p = .05. As 
expected, boredom negatively predicted rehearsal, b = -.18, t = -1.94, p = .025, and critical 
thinking, b = -.15, t = -1.53, p = .05. Lastly, for relations between learning strategies and learning 
achievement, critical thinking positively predicted learning achievement, b = .21, t = 1.68, p = 
.046. However, rehearsal unexpectedly predicted learning achievement, b = .26, t = 2.33, p = .01.  
5.2.2.4. Mediation effects of learning strategies between epistemic emotions and 
learning achievement. As part of the second step of the path analysis, we tested for mediation 
between epistemic emotions and learning achievement via learning strategies. Consistent with 
Muis et al.’s (2015) framework, mediation analyses revealed that rehearsal mediated relations 
between boredom and learning achievement, with a standardized point estimate of -.04 and a 
90% confidence interval of -.113 to -.009. Similarly, critical thinking mediated relations between 
boredom and learning achievement, with a standardized point estimate of -.03 and a 90% 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
92 
confidence interval of -.087 to -.001. Both were full mediations. These results indicate that 
boredom predicted the use of less rehearsal and less critical thinking, both of which in turn 
predicted lower learning achievement. Consistent with predictions, critical thinking fully 
mediated relations between curiosity and learning achievement, with a standardized point 
estimate of .03 and a 90% confidence interval of .001 to .100. This indicates that curiosity 
predicted more critical thinking, which in turn, predicted greater learning achievement. No 
further significant results were identified. Table 12 presents a comparison of expected relations 
versus observed relations. We discuss and interpret these results next. 
6. General Discussion 
 
We sought to better understand the role that epistemic emotions play when learning 
about complex and controversial socio-scientific topics. Specifically, we sought to test and 
extend Muis and colleagues’ (2015) theoretical framework, which proposes relations between 
epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and learning achievement during 
complex learning. We employed two different methods of analysis and used self-reported data as 
well as trace data to explore the antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions. We 
responded to calls to examine the sequential dynamics between emotions and cognition (D’Mello 
et al., 2014; Goetz et al., 2014; Muis et al., 2015) and considered a broad set of epistemic 
cognitive processes that may play an important role in contending with complex and 
controversial knowledge (Chinn & Rinehart, 2016; Greene et al., 2008). We operationalized 
learning as a deep understanding of text, as captured by an intra-text inference verification task. 
 
Overall, our findings provide support for Muis et al.’s (2015) proposition that epistemic 
beliefs act as an antecedent to epistemic emotions via appraisals of epistemic congruity, but also 
found that other types of cognitive appraisals, including appraisals of novelty and complexity, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
93 
and appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims, also served as antecedents to epistemic 
emotions. Further, results supported the proposition that epistemic emotions have consequences 
for self-regulated learning via learning strategies and epistemic strategies employed. In the 
following sections, we discuss the extent to which findings aligned with Muis et al.’s (2015) 
framework and previous empirical work. Lastly, we consider theoretical implications for 
research on epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition, and discuss limitations and directions 
for future work. 
6.1 Antecedents of Epistemic Emotions  
 
The combined analysis of self-reported and real-time data provided empirical evidence 
for the arousal of epistemic emotions when learning from complex and contradictory learning 
material. The analysis of think-aloud protocols provided evidence for three antecedents to 
epistemic emotions: appraisals of epistemic (in)congruency, appraisals of information novelty 
and complexity, and appraisals of the attainment of epistemic aims. In response to our first 
research question, it appears that the majority of epistemic emotions were triggered by appraisals 
of information novelty and complexity. This result is consistent with Loewenstein’s (1994) 
knowledge gap theory and Silvia’s (2010) novelty-complexity theory which, taken together, 
stipulate that emotions such as curiosity, surprise, and confusion arise from the processing of 
novel or challenging information in contexts that can be more or less complex.  
 
The fact that epistemic emotions related to epistemic (in)congruity were less frequent 
than epistemic emotions related to information novelty and complexity might be explained by 
the tacit nature of epistemic beliefs and the distinct role they play in learning. Drawing from 
Muis’s (2007) model of epistemic beliefs and self-regulated learning, we suggest that epistemic 
emotions related to epistemic (in)congruity may be more prominent during the task definition 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
94 
phase of self-regulated learning. According to Muis (2007), the task definition phase of self-
regulated learning involves the activation of learners’ tacit epistemic beliefs and the perception 
of the task’s characteristics – including its epistemic characteristics – which then feed into the 
creation of an idiosyncratic task definition. Task definition, like other self-regulated learning 
phases, is an ongoing process: As learners encounter new pieces of information, they may 
recycle or revise their task definition. As such, appraisals of epistemic congruity may only occur 
during the punctual event that is task definition or redefinition, making epistemic emotions 
related to epistemic (in)congruity less frequent than epistemic emotions related to appraisals of 
information novelty and complexity. As for epistemic emotions related to epistemic aims, their 
low frequency of occurrence may be due to the nature of the task presented: An ill-defined 
problem-solving situation, for instance, might have led to more emotions related to epistemic 
aims (see D’Mello et al., 2014). In sum, more research is needed to explore the arousal of 
epistemic emotions in authentic and varied contexts, such as problem-solving situations, or 
collaborative group work.  
 
As for relations between epistemic emotions and epistemic cognition, while we did not 
have a specific hypothesis for the order of transitions between these variables, our observations 
are aligned with theoretical relations. We found that, in cases where epistemic emotions and 
epistemic cognition were sequentially related, epistemic cognition always occurred after 
epistemic emotions. Whereas epistemic beliefs are posited to be activated prior to appraisals of 
epistemic congruity, our observations suggest that epistemic cognition such as using epistemic 
strategies is likely to occur after the arousal of epistemic emotions, just like other learning 
strategies. For instance, epistemic emotions related to appraisals of information novelty and 
complexity might be followed by a justification strategy that focuses on the discrepant 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
95 
information (D’Mello et al., 2014). Similarly, epistemic emotions related to epistemic 
incongruity might be followed by a source evaluation strategy or an integration strategy, and 
epistemic emotions related to the obstruction of an epistemic aim might be followed by recycling 
that aim or setting a new one. In other words, our observations suggest that whether one 
measures epistemic beliefs or epistemic strategies or aims matters in terms of the sequential 
ordering of relations. Moving forward, researchers will need to clearly differentiate between 
epistemic beliefs and other, more dynamic epistemic cognitive processes, and to select 
measurement methods accordingly (Mason, 2016). 
6.2 Evaluating Muis et al.’s (2015) Model 
 
Overall, results obtained from state-transition analysis (Study 1) and path analysis 
(Study 2) were broadly aligned with Muis et al.’s (2015) model. In terms of relations between 
epistemic beliefs and epistemic emotions, out of 28 hypothesized relations, eight significant 
paths were observed, linking each dimension of epistemic beliefs to one of the epistemic 
emotions considered. Indeed, out of the eight significant paths obtained, six were aligned with 
hypothesis. Specifically, individuals who believed in the active construction of knowledge 
reported less anxiety during learning, and individuals who believed that knowledge claims are 
justified via inquiry reported more curiosity and enjoyment, as well as less frustration and 
boredom. Unexpectedly, those who believed in justification via inquiry reported more surprise, 
and those who believed that knowledge is uncertain reported more boredom. Boredom, which 
has been found to arise after prolonged confusion (D’Mello et al., 2014), was not expected to 
arise for learners who believed in the tentative character of climate change knowledge. The 
existence of conflicting claims about climate change might have seemed obvious to individuals 
who believe in the uncertainty of climate change knowledge, who may have been bored with the 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
96 
characterization of climate change knowledge in the experimental material. Of course, this 
relationship may also be a spurious one. As for surprise, whereas Muis et al. (2015) found that 
surprise was unrelated to epistemic beliefs, we obtained different results: Surprise was positively 
predicted by less constructivist epistemic beliefs about the complexity of knowledge (expected), 
but also by more constructivist beliefs about the justification for knowing (unexpected). Less 
constructivist epistemic beliefs may relate to the arousal of surprise in cases where the epistemic 
nature of the learning task is perplexing to learners, as suggested by Muis et al. (2015). On the 
other hand, the vast majority of instances of surprise in think-aloud protocols was found to relate 
to novel and/or challenging information, not to epistemic cognition.  
 
In terms of relations between epistemic beliefs and learning strategies, four significant 
paths were observed, all in support of Muis et al.’s (2015) model, which comprised 16 
hypothesized relations. Consistent with previous theoretical (Muis, 2007) and empirical (Chan, 
Ho, & Ku, 2011; Lin, Liang, & Tsai, 2012; Nielson, 2011; Pieschl, Stallman, & Bromme, 2014) 
work, more constructivist epistemic beliefs directly predicted deeper learning strategies. Indeed, 
a belief in the complexity of climate change knowledge positively related to greater use of 
critical thinking and elaboration strategies, as did a belief in justification via inquiry.  
 
As for relations between epistemic emotions and learning strategies, path analysis and 
state-transition analysis generally supported the hypothesis that neutral and positive emotions 
such as curiosity and enjoyment support a deeper engagement with the learning tasks, whereas 
negative emotions such as anxiety and frustration relate to shallower engagement. Out of 14 
hypothesized relations, we identified seven significant paths: three were consistent with 
hypotheses, one was counter to hypotheses, and three were not hypothesized per se. 
Additionally, state-transition analysis showed three meaningful relations between epistemic 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
97 
emotions and learning strategies, one which was in line with hypotheses, and two that were 
unexpected. Specifically, curiosity was related to all learning strategies, deep and shallow. This 
finding replicates results from Muis et al. (2015), who also found that curiosity was the most 
significant predictor of learning strategies among epistemic emotions. In Study 2, we found that 
curiosity related to greater learning achievement via critical thinking. Research by Bohn-Gettler 
and Rapp (2011) had similarly shown that individuals induced with a happy mood engaged in 
more coherence-building inferences and attained greater text comprehension than sad-induced 
individuals. As for enjoyment, unlike Muis et al. (2015), we found no significant relations to 
learning strategies in path analysis, but state-transition analysis revealed that learners tended to 
continue to read after having expressed enjoyment, which indicates that enjoyment has 
consequences for learners’ motivation via continued engagement with the learning material.  
 
For negative emotions, results suggest that they may hinder the use of deep learning 
strategies. Path analysis showed that anxiety negatively related to knowledge elaboration 
(although this trend did not reach significance), and boredom negatively related to critical 
thinking and rehearsal. As for surprise, considered a neutral emotion, its relationship with 
learning strategies was inconsistent across the two studies: Replicating findings by Muis et al. 
(2015), surprise negatively predicted critical thinking in path analysis; however, surprise was 
shown to positively predict critical thinking in state-transition analysis. Muis et al. (2018) 
suggest that when the experience of surprise is mild, learner’s engagement with the task is not 
interrupted or perturbed. However, when the intensity of surprise is high and the information is 
perceived as comprehensible, Silvia (2010) suggests that curiosity ensues, which in turn 
enhances the likelihood of critical thinking, as demonstrated in our first study. Might it be the 
case that the arousal of curiosity between surprise and a subsequent state is so short that it fails to 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
98 
be verbalized by learners? More research is needed to empirically test how curiosity may 
moderate the relationship between surprise and critical thinking. 
 
Finally, results provide support for the hypothesis that epistemic emotions relate to 
one’s understanding of complex and controversial socio-scientific topics via learning strategies. 
We found full mediation between epistemic emotions, learning strategies and learning 
achievement. Contrary to Muis et al. (2015), who had unexpectedly found a negative effect of 
curiosity, enjoyment and confusion on learning via metacognitive self-regulation, our findings 
are consistent with the hypothesized model. Curiosity emerged as the most significant epistemic 
emotion, predicting greater learning via critical thinking (in path analysis) and metacognitive 
self-regulation (in state-transition analysis). For negative emotions, boredom emerged as the 
more consequential epistemic emotion, predicting lesser learning by decreasing the use of both 
deep and shallow learning strategies.  
 
Overall, findings from this research suggest that to advance research on epistemic 
emotions, future work will have to consider various arousal antecedents to emotions, as emotions 
triggered by different appraisals may lead to different consequences for learning. Although 
results from our first study did not show differences in consequences as a function of epistemic 
emotions’ antecedents, our investigation was limited by the small number of transitions on which 
we could conduct statistical analyses. As such, more research is needed before a definitive 
conclusion can be reached regarding the role of antecedents of epistemic emotions in predicting 
consequences for learning. Similarly, future research should consider subtypes of emotions, and 
how these may differentially predict self-regulated learning. For instance, how may interest-type 
curiosity and deprivation-type curiosity (Litman & Jimerson, 2004) be differently predicted by 
various informational or epistemic contexts? And how may these different types of curiosity 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
99 
predict different learning processes and outcomes? Similarly, how may various information or 
epistemic contexts trigger different intensities of surprise (Munnich & Ranney, 2018) or 
boredom (Goetz et al., 2011) and what type of strategies may learners put in place to regulate 
different intensities of epistemic emotions?  
 
In sum, it appears that Muis et al.’s (2015) integrated model may require the inclusion 
of predictive variables such as epistemic aims, and moderating variables such as information 
novelty and complexity, and emotional intensity to fully explain how epistemic emotions relate 
to epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning. Consequently, this will require that future 
work uses specific measurement methods to uncover learners’ epistemic aims, and to investigate 
learners’ appraisals of information novelty and complexity as learning unfolds. To this end, 
facial video recording can be combined with retrospective affective-cognitive judgment 
protocols (see D’Mello & Graesser, 2012).  
6.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Work 
 
The work presented here included a number of limitations that should be considered and 
addressed in future work. A first limitation concerns the small sample that was used for this 
research relative to the large number of hypotheses tested. The resource demands of using think-
aloud protocols to measure cognitive or affective processes often lead to relatively small sample 
sizes that can affect statistical power. Relatedly, the large number of statistical tests conducted 
herein may have led to alpha inflation. However, using a correction would be too restrictive as it 
would reduce power. A larger sample size would address this issue. As such, we recommend 
using caution when interpreting the current findings. A second limitation concerns the 
investigation of emotions using a think-aloud method. Specifically, the occurrence of emotions 
in this study was relatively low, and this may be because we did not specifically instruct learners 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
100 
to express their emotions out loud. Akin to individuals’ threshold for experiencing an emotion 
(D’Mello et al., 2014), individuals’ threshold for expressing an emotion out loud is likely to be 
highly idiosyncratic and sensitive to social and emotional regulation. No elements in the design 
of this study were put in place to minimize barriers to emotion verbalization. To counter this 
inherent limitation, researchers should consider emote-aloud protocols (e.g., Craig et al., 2008; 
D’Mello, Craig, Sullins, & Graesser, 2006) where participants are specifically encouraged and 
trained to verbalize their affective states. However, for this method to fully serve researchers, 
groundwork is needed where language is closely examined to decipher how learners 
spontaneously label their emotions. For instance, do expressions such as “I’m intrigued” and “I 
wonder” reflect curiosity, or might they as well reflect confusion or frustration? Do indicators 
such as “astonished” and “amazed” reflect similar or different emotions? Researchers may 
consider complementing emote-aloud methods with cognitive interviewing to answer such 
interrogations.  
 
A third limitation pertains to the absence of measurement and control of individual 
verbosity. Researchers using think-aloud protocols can address verbosity by using time-stamped 
data combined with statistical transformations (see, for example, Azevedo, Johnson, Chauncey, 
& Burkett, 2011). However, such data were not available for the current work. More research is 
needed to understand how individual differences in emotion expression may be addressed or 
controlled. Lastly, future research should consider the characteristics of the content and of the 
task that trigger emotions, such as reading text versus problem solving, or group work versus 
solo work. To further understand the role of epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions in self-
regulated learning, it will be important for future studies to examine these constructs in contexts 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
101 
and disciplines that embrace an epistemology that differ from the epistemology of science, such 
as history or economics. 
 
To conclude, this research attests to the importance of considering multiple data sources 
to advance knowledge about emotions and cognition in learning. Here, we have operated a 
conceptual and empirical distinction between epistemic beliefs and broader epistemic cognition 
that we believe will be fruitful for future research. Further, we have responded to calls to 
examine the temporal dynamics of epistemic emotions with innovative analyses, and have 
brought meaningful insights about the nature of epistemic emotions, including their antecedents 
and consequences for learning. We also contributed to advancing and extending Muis et al.’s 
(2015) integrated framework of epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, and self-regulated 
learning, which proposes one promising mediational mechanism to explain how epistemic 
cognition relates to self-regulated learning. Lastly, we believe that this work also extends 
Pekrun’s (2006) control-value theory of achievement emotions by proposing new types of 
cognitive appraisals that serve as antecedents to emotions in educational settings. Given the 
importance of epistemic emotions, epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning for deep 
learning (Muis et al., 2015) and higher-order thinking processes such as critical thinking (Chan et 
al., 2011; Greene & Yu, 2016) and digital literacy (Greene et al., 2014), this research also 
indicates that much work is still needed to develop learning environments that efficiently 
leverage epistemic emotions to the benefit of a greater understanding of the complex and 
controversial issues that define the world we live in today.

Epistemic congruity or incongruity may be viewed as a special case of cognitive 
congruity or incongruity. Muis et al.’s (2015) use the term “cognitive incongruity” in 
their work to refer to the same phenomenon.

The Flesch-Kincaid readability test was developed in 1975 by Kincaid and colleagues 
(Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers & Chissom, 1975) to assess the reading difficulty of U.S. 
Navy technical manuals and are now extensively used in education. The Flesch-Kincaid 
Grade Level presents a score as a US grade level, which also indicates the number of 
years of education generally required to understand a text.

Learning strategies were also self-reported by participants using the Motivation Strategies 
for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich et al., 1993). However, data were not used 
in the analyses, given the high frequency and decent spread of the distributions from the 
think-aloud protocols. Moreover, think-aloud data have been shown to be more reliable 
measures for learning strategies than self-reported data (Winne et al., 2002).

Table 1 
Coding scheme for epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and epistemic cognition in think-aloud protocols 
Code 
Description 
Example 
Epistemic emotions 
Surprise 
Astonished, amazed 
Epistemic: [The ocean level will rise by 10 to 20 cm…] “Holy 
goodness!”  
“[We still do not have a basis for establishing that human 
pollution of the atmosphere is the main cause of climate 
change.] I find very surprising.”  
“[This will have a dramatic effect on farming and forestry, 
while at the same time there will be a greater need for 
heating.] That really surprises me.”  
“[... the concentration of methane has increased by around 
151%] Wow, this is shocking.” 
 
Enjoyment 
Excited, enthusiastic 
Epistemic: “That’s kind of cool to know!” 
“I think I like where this is going.” 
 
Achievement: “Cool. I feel good about this. On to the next 
one.” 
 
Curiosity 
Interested, intrigued 
Epistemic: “It’s interesting to think about how one comes into 
play with the other.” 
“I wonder where it’s increasing.” 
 
Confusion 
Puzzled, muddled 
Epistemic: “Hum, the article says that the greenhouse effect is 
naturally occurring while the other article said that the 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
118 
greenhouse effect is made by humankind. Did I read the other 
one wrong?”  
“Ok. I’m kind of confused.” 
 
Frustration 
Irritated, dissatisfied 
Epistemic: “[The oil and gas deposits that are concealed there 
are estimated to amount to 30% of the earth’s deposits.]  Ooh, 
this guy frustrates me.”  
“I think it’s kind of ridiculous to pretend that what people are 
doing somehow hasn’t affected climate change.” 
 
Topic: “[A warmer climate could result in better growing 
conditions and lower heating costs.] This is literally stupid.” 
“…and then America can just annex us and then we can just 
create a fortress of North America and that’ll be great, you 
know... I don’t know, this is frustrating.”  
 
Achievement: “[The sun's magnetic field will, to a varying 
degree, stem the quantity of particles that penetrate our 
atmosphere.] I don’t get this. This is so annoying.” 
 
Anxiety 
Worried, nervous 
Topic: “[The Arctic ice is melting so quickly that a sea 
passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 
may be accessible to ordinary ships during the summer by 
2050.] That sounds really horrible and scary.” 
 
Boredom 
Dull, monotonous 
Achievement: “Manmade greenhouse... blah blah blah. Ugh.”  
 “Okay, this is not important, I won't take notes.”  
 
Self-regulated learning strategies 
Prior knowledge 
activation 
Searching memory for relevant prior 
knowledge; asserting that information 
“[…water vapor, which is by far the most significant, by 
causing a lot of clouds in the atmosphere.] Also, the 
chlorophane gases are also important for global warming.”  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
119 
from text was prior knowledge in 
memory 
“That’s what we see in the news.”  
 
Rereading 
Rereading or revisiting a section of 
the text that had previously been read 
“[…North Atlantic to such a degree that there is a genuine risk 
of serious and long-term cooling.] …genuine risk long-term 
cooling.” 
  
Reproduction strategies 
Paraphrasing; rehearsal for 
memorization 
  
“He also mentions enormous riches oil and gas deposits.”  
Critical thinking 
Making judgments on the basis of a 
criterion; developing one’s own 
opinion on the basis of what was read; 
qualifying or ascribing value to 
information; thinking about 
implications beyond the text 
“Kind of a catch 22, almost, that oil which in turn fossil fuels 
are helping or making the ice caps melt, and by the ice caps 
melting we’re getting more oil, that helps the ice caps melt 
more.” 
“This text doesn’t explain much about the blame that is 
assumed.” 
“This is a huge range.” 
 
Knowledge elaboration 
Coordinating informational sources; 
generative note-taking; producing 
summaries that include elements from 
more than three sentences apart; 
making inferences; hypothesizing; 
elaborating on what has been read 
with prior knowledge or other 
elements in the text or in previous 
texts; self-questioning 
 
“This can have negative consequences such as, um, rising 
ocean levels which in turn create more evaporation which 
can lead to stronger weather patterns, I guess.”  
“These manmade discharges, do they increase the 
concentration?” 
“Right, so even though quantitatively our discharges may 
not be significant, it is in effect disrupting the balance, 
which is the carbon dioxide cycle.”  
Metacognitive self-
regulation 
Making judgment of learning; 
emitting feeling of knowing; 
monitoring progress towards goals; 
monitoring use of strategies 
“I didn’t know that.” 
“Wait, what? I’m going to have to read that again.” 
 “So far, I understand everything.” 
“…and visualization helps me to remember things, hopefully 
it’ll help.” 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
120 
 
Epistemic cognition  
Epistemic beliefs 
Stating that knowledge is simple or 
complex (complexity), certain or 
tentative (certainty), that the source of 
knowing is oneself via active 
construction or experts and other 
authoritative sources (source). 
“…that’s not something, well for right now, well we can 
never know for certain, but we don’t exactly have the best 
idea now.”  
“[Global warming may also weaken the Gulf Stream and 
result in serious cooling in Northern Europe.] The key word 
there is “may.” There are too many things going on.” 
“…all these factors contribute to a major change in climate. 
But it is unknown for now.” 
“I would like to know who is doing the research for the UN 
climate panel, and then decide for myself whether the 
information is reliable, accurate.” 
 
Epistemic aims 
Setting the aim to acquire facts, 
understand processes, or develop an 
integrated perspective 
 
“I would like to hear other people’s thoughts on this though, 
particularly indigenous folks.” 
Sourcing strategies 
Evaluating the quality and relevancy 
of a source on the basis of 
trustworthiness of the author or the 
quality of the evidence provided 
“I would like to know more about him, what else, what other 
research he has been doing, see if he is a reliable source for 
information.” 
“So this author should like, show that the change in the orbit 
or the change in the sun activity is also increasing the 
temperature of the earth. People won’t be able to evaluate 
whether this is true or not.” 
“Okay Time Magazine, that is not science, that’s like third-
hand news.” 
 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
121 
Integration strategies 
Evaluating, comparing and 
contrasting claims made across 
multiple sources; providing 
explanations to account for 
differences between the various 
perspectives 
“I think they’re both true, I can’t pick one and say the other is 
not true I don’t think. They’re probably both related in some 
way.” 
“Okay so while this article addresses facts about the climate in 
relation to the atmosphere these things are not mutually 
exclusive things.”  
“But it just said a lot of the place, in the last article, a lot of 
the temperature gets colder. Now I don’t know who to 
believe.” 
Justification strategies 
Evaluating and justifying knowledge 
on the basis of personal experiences 
(i.e., the five senses), recall of 
information stored in memory, 
coherence with knowledge claims that 
are believed to be true, logic or 
scientific reasoning; or making a 
decision on the trustworthiness or 
veracity of a knowledge claim 
without further justification 
 “I don’t know how hurricanes work at all so I am just going 
to take this guy on his word.” 
“…that also makes sense and checks out to things I’ve learned 
to date.” 
“[Time magazine reports that hurricanes have increased in 
both number and intensity since 1995.] That’s a very short 
time to be measured. Maybe take a longer sample. 
“[Time magazine reports that hurricanes have increased in 
both number and intensity since 1995.] Yes, I can attest to 
that.”

Table 2 
Coding scheme for antecedents of epistemic emotions 
Antecedent of epistemic 
emotion 
Description 
Example 
Epistemic (in)congruity 
Epistemic emotion is related 
to an appraisal of alignment 
of misalignment between the 
epistemic nature of the task 
and one’s beliefs about the 
nature of knowledge, the 
source of knowing, or the 
justification for knowing. 
 
Surprise: “Wow (surprise), they’re at odds with each other!” 
 
Curiosity: “I mean it’s interesting to learn about a different 
viewpoint.”  
 
Frustration: “I think it’s ridiculous to pretend that what people are 
doing somehow hasn’t affected climate.” 
 
Information novelty and 
complexity 
 
Epistemic emotion is related 
to an appraisal of alignment 
or misalignment between new 
or recently processed 
information and one’s prior 
knowledge, based on 
information’s novelty and 
complexity.  
 
Surprise: “[…of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by around 31 
per cent.] Wow! That’s shocking.” 
 
Curiosity: “[Time magazine reports that hurricanes have increased 
in both number and intensity since 1995.] I wonder what the 
number is exactly.” 
 
Confusion: “Okay, kind of confused about the whole water vapor 
thing, the difference, or relation between that and our C02 
discharges, but everything else seems to make sense.” 
 
Epistemic aims 
Epistemic emotion is related 
to an appraisal of attainment 
or blockage of epistemic aim 
Enjoyment: When particles that originate from previously 
exploded stars penetrate the atmosphere, they could affect the 
formation of low clouds. That’s kind of cool to know!”

Experimental Texts 
1. Manmade Greenhouse Effect: Humans Cause Climate Change 
 
Center for International Climate and Environmental Research - University of Oslo 
http://www.cicero.uio.no/abc/klimaendringer.html 
 
The UN's climate panel concludes in its third main report from 2001 that it is highly probable 
that manmade discharges of climate gases have contributed significantly to the climate changes 
observed in the last 30 to 50 years.  
 
Manmade greenhouse effect 
Since pre-industrial times (around 1750) the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased 
by around 31 per cent, the concentration of methane (CH4) has increased by around 151 per cent 
and the concentration of nitrogen oxide (N2O) has increased by around 17 per cent. These 
increases are due to manmade discharges and have resulted in a stronger greenhouse effect. 
Human activities have also introduced into the atmosphere smaller quantities of a number of 
climate gases that do not exist in the atmosphere naturally. 
 
The increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere forms the primary constituent 
(around 60%) of the strengthening of the greenhouse effect for which mankind is responsible. 
These manmade discharges of CO2 are first and foremost due to the consumption of fossil fuels 
(coal, oil and gas) and the deforestation of tropical regions. 
 
Mankind’s discharges amount to only a small part of the quantity of climate gases released into 
the atmosphere and the effect is minor in relation to, for example, the effect of naturally 
occurring water vapour. The problem is that the climate system is very complex and sensitive, 
and even small changes in the system can trigger major consequences. Nature’s own discharges 
of climate gases form part of a cycle in which, for example, rotting trees release CO2 and living 
trees absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. Our CO2 discharges from, among other things, the 
burning of fossil fuels do not form part of this cycle and result in surplus CO2 which remains in 
the atmosphere for a long time.  
 
 
2. Climate Changes Are Due To Natural Causes. 
 
APOLLON – University of Oslo research magazine 
Professor Oddbjørn Engvold, Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo 
Climate has always varied over time and will continue to do so. This is a normal state of affairs. 
Changes to the earth’s climate are to a large extent steered by astronomical conditions. For 
example, small changes in the earth’s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt with respect to 
the earth’s rotational axis – which is responsible for us having seasons – are associated with 
significant climate changes. Changeovers between ice ages and warmer periods are demonstrably 
linked to these external astronomical conditions. 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
133 
 
The sun affects the layer of clouds 
Without the sun we would not have the greenhouse effect, which is a prerequisite for us having 
liveable conditions on our planet. Even small variations in the radiation from the sun will affect 
the climate. The sun is a magnetic star and areas of its surface have strong magnetic fields. These 
affect its radiation and can result in both weak increases and decreases, and these in turn affect 
the climate even in the case of changes at the per thousand level. 
 
The sun’s magnetic fields surround both the earth and the other planets. When particles that 
originate from previously exploded stars penetrate the atmosphere, they could affect the 
formation of low clouds. This in turn has an effect on the earth’s weather. The sun’s magnetic 
field will, to a varying degree, stem the quantity of particles that penetrate our atmosphere. This 
could function as an “on/off” switch for the layer of clouds around the earth.  
 
There has been much debate about climate in recent years and the discussion has often been 
about the extent to which mankind’s activities are affecting our climate in relation to the natural 
variations. We still do not have a basis for establishing that human pollution of the atmosphere is 
the main cause of climate change.  
 
 
3. The Negative Consequences Of A Stronger Greenhouse Effect 
 
Stronger storms, more hurricanes and increasingly tumultuous weather are just a few of 
the negative consequences we can expect in the next few years. Global warming may also 
weaken the Gulf Stream and result in serious cooling in Northern Europe. 
 
JOURNALIST GUSTAV JENSEN  
A number of oceanographers fear highly uncomfortable side effects due to global warming. It 
may weaken the ocean currents in the North Atlantic to such a degree that there is a genuine risk 
of serious and long-term cooling both in the Nordic Region and large parts of Europe and North 
America. The Nordic Region would be significantly colder without the Gulf Stream.  
 
Oceanographers know all too well that the warnings will cause surprise because we are reminded 
almost daily of the opposite, namely that global warming will raise the earth’s average 
temperature. However, paradoxically, both things could well occur at the same time. If the 
circulation of the Atlantic is disturbed, we could have a fall in the average temperature of 3-5 °C. 
This will have a dramatic effect on farming and forestry, while at the same time there will be a 
greater need for heating. 
 
And there is much that indicates that the disturbances are well underway. More ice is melting 
due to global warming and more precipitation is falling over, among other places, Russia. This is 
resulting in greater outward flows of freshwater from the major Russian rivers into the Arctic 
Ocean. At the same time we risk losing the Western Arctic ice and Greenland ice. 
 
When the ice surrounding the poles melts, this will not just result in an increased mass of water, 
it will also result in increased evaporation from the oceans. This will provide hurricanes with 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
134 
energy. Time magazine reports that hurricanes have increased in both number and intensity since 
1995.  
 
According to the UN's climate panel, an increased greenhouse effect resulted in water levels 
rising between 10 and 20 cm in the last century and by 2100 ocean levels will rise by between 9 
and 88 cm. This will be catastrophic for many coastal communities – especially in developing 
countries.  
 
 
4. Warmer Climate Presents New Opportunities 
 
Regions that are now becoming accessible due to global warming conceal enormous riches. 
The melting of the ice permits the exploitation of resources in the northerly regions. 
 
JOURNALIST JOHN HULTGREN 
 
Temperatures around the North Pole are increasing at double the rate of other places around the 
globe according to UN experts. The Arctic ice is melting so quickly that a sea passage between 
the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean may be accessible to ordinary ships during the summer 
by 2050. The route through the Northwest Passage to Asia will reduce the journey distance 
between London and Tokyo from 21,000 to 16,000 kilometres. 
 
The northern regions that are becoming accessible also conceal enormous riches. The oil and gas 
deposits that are concealed there are estimated to amount to 30 per cent of the earth’s deposits.  
 
And there is more to be found in the northern regions than petroleum. There is also gold, 
diamonds, copper and zinc. There will be a lot of traffic due to such exploration says Frederic 
Lasserre, a geographer at Laval University in Quebec in Canada who is a specialist in Arctic 
regions. 
 
The director of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, also points out positive 
consequences of global warming, which occurs in the Arctic in particular: - A warmer climate 
could result in better growing conditions and lower heating costs. The ice in the Barents Sea will 
be pushed northwards and eastwards due to increasing south-westerly winds and warmer 
weather. This will expand winter fishing grounds and make it easier for the gas and oil industry 
to operate during the winter season.

Appendix C 
Topic-Specific Epistemic Beliefs Questionnaire (Adapted to Climate Change) 
Issues concerning climate are highly topical and often mentioned in the media. We can read 
daily about issues such as climate change, pollution of the atmosphere, global warming, extreme 
weather, rise in ocean levels, and melting of ice in polar regions. This is material that we often 
encounter in newspapers and magazines, as well as on TV and radio. Most people who do 
research on climate have a background in natural science, for example in chemistry, biology, or 
meteorology. The following questions concern knowledge about climate and how one comes to 
know about climate. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions; it is your personal 
beliefs that interest us. Use the scale below to answer the questions. If you strongly agree with a 
statement, circle 10; if you strongly disagree, circle 1. If you more or less agree with a 
statement, circle the number between 1 and 10 that best expresses your belief.

Bridging Text 
In Chapter 3, we empirically tested a model that situates epistemic emotions as mediators 
in the relation between epistemic cognition and self-regulated learning. Antecedents of epistemic 
emotions were examined using verbal data, and two analytical approaches were used to test the 
model at different levels of granularity: In Study 1, we examined the immediate consequences of 
epistemic emotions on self-regulated learning strategies; in Study 2, we assessed predictive 
relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, learning strategies, and learning 
achievement over an entire learning session.  
In Chapter 4, the generalizability of this model is tested by examining the mediational 
role of epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and another important 
outcome of education: critical thinking. When thinking about socio-scientific issues, one goal is 
to educate learners who can think critically in making decisions that have personal and societal 
consequences. Further, researchers have called for greater conceptual clarity between epistemic 
cognition and critical thinking, and emphasized the importance of empirical research to map the 
interrelationships between these two constructs (see Bråten, 2016). The study presented in 
Chapter 4 addresses this question by situating epistemic cognition as one important underpinning 
to critical thinking. Furthermore, it addresses limitations in epistemic cognition and critical 
thinking research by presenting an empirical study that measures critical thinking in a 
meaningful way in the context of an epistemically demanding task.

Abstract 
When contending with socio-scientific issues, individuals’ expectations about the nature of 
knowledge and knowing, as well as their emotions when these expectations are met or not, may 
play an important role in critical thinking. In this study, we examined the role of epistemic 
emotions in mediating the relationship between epistemic cognition and critical thinking when 
contending with conflicting knowledge about genetically modified foods. Two hundred four 
university students completed a prior knowledge test and reported epistemic beliefs about 
genetically modified foods and read a text that presented advantages and disadvantages of 
genetically modified foods. Participants then reported the epistemic emotions they experienced 
during reading, and then composed an argumentative essay about genetically modified foods. 
Essays were coded for critical thinking. Results from path analysis revealed that a belief in 
complex knowledge predicted less surprise, less enjoyment, less confusion, and less frustration, 
and a belief in the active constructive of knowledge predicted more frustration. In turn, confusion 
and anxiety positively predicted critical thinking, and frustration and boredom negatively 
predicted critical thinking. Lastly, confusion and frustration mediated relations between 
epistemic beliefs and critical thinking. Results suggest complex relations between epistemic 
cognition, epistemic emotions, and critical thinking that have implications for educational 
practice as well as for future research on epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions.

Introduction 
The information landscape in the 21st century is one of contrast. On the one hand, the 
Internet and social media provide an unprecedented wealth of diverse and accessible information 
from around the world. On the other hand, the structure of social networks and algorithmic 
filtering (e.g., news feeds, recommendations) have considerably narrowed the breadth of content 
that individuals consume, making it increasingly difficult to escape echo chambers and challenge 
one’s views with new information (Garimella, De Francisci Morales, Gionis, & Mathioudakis, 
2018; Marks, Copland, Loh, Sunstein, & Sharot, 2019; Sîrbu, Pedreschi, Giannotti, & Kertész, 
2019). In this context, any topic is likely to become the object of controversy. Topics of personal 
and global relevance such as ways to combat climate change or the safety of infant vaccines 
appear to be controversial and unresolved matters, dividing the public’s opinion and stifling 
political action. To make informed decisions individually and collectively, the challenge lies in 
overcoming personal biases, and weighing the pros and cons of conflicting perspectives to 
reconcile views. This is one aspect of the process known as critical thinking (Kuhn, 2018).  
There is little debate over the idea that society benefits when individuals are able to think 
deeply and critically about important issues (e.g., Dewey, 1933; Halpern, 2014). Educating 
critical thinkers is of vital importance for the well-being of future generations. Accordingly, the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD; Tremblay, Lalancette & 
Roseveare, 2012) has made teaching critical thinking a priority for higher education. However, 
empirical research in the United States shows that teaching critical thinking skills is arduous and 
often unyielding (Abrami et al., 2008; Huber & Kuncel, 2015; Niu, Behar-Horenstein, & Garvan, 
2013), with up to 45% of American students completing post-secondary degrees lacking these 
essential skills (Arum & Roksa, 2011). In light of these observations, many have pointed out that 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
148 
to improve critical thinking outcomes, empirical work is needed to achieve a greater 
understanding of the underlying cognitive, motivational, and affective mechanisms that enable 
critical thinking (Alexander, 2014; Bråten, 2016; Greene & Yu, 2016). 
Controversial socio-scientific topics are characterized by the presence of opposing views 
that offer conflicting explanations to complex and multifaceted phenomena (Levinson, 2006). 
Deciding what to believe or what to do about these topics requires that individuals engage with 
the underlying issues of knowledge that characterizes these topics: What counts as knowledge? 
How certain are the facts? Who can be trusted to provide a clear perspective on the topic? In 
other words, thinking critically about socio-scientific topics requires thinking about the 
knowledge- and knowing-related aspects of these issues (Greene & Yu, 2016), a process termed 
epistemic cognition (Greene, Bråten, & Sandoval, 2016). However, when engaged with complex 
and conflicting issues, individuals’ expectations about the nature of knowledge and knowing 
may be challenged, and in turn elicit emotions such as surprise, curiosity, confusion, frustration, 
or anxiety (Muis, Chevrier, & Singh, 2018; Muis et al., 2015).  
Common understandings of critical thinking assume that emotions have no role to play in 
critical thinking, except perhaps to introduce unwarranted bias (Kahneman, 2004). However, 
knowing and feeling are closely related, and emotions may play a significant role in helping 
individuals disentangle the two (Brun & Kuenzle, 2008; Damasio, 2005). Indeed, evidence 
suggests that the way individuals feel about complex and conflicting knowledge plays a role in 
knowledge building and knowledge revision (Muis et al., 2015; Trevors & Kendeou, 2017). 
However, little is known about how cognitive and affective processes relate to critical thinking. 
As such, the aim of the current study is to shed light on the role that epistemic cognition and 
epistemic emotions play when thinking critically about socio-scientific issues. In the following 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
149 
sections, we define the concepts of critical thinking, epistemic cognition, and epistemic 
emotions, and review theoretical and empirical work that informed the hypotheses of the current 
study. 
Thinking Critically About Controversial Topics 
Critical thinking is regarded as one of the most important skills that individuals can 
develop and is a fundamental aim of education (Bailin and Siegel, 2003; Halpern, 2014). Though 
several definitions of critical thinking are offered in the literature (e.g., Ennis, 2018; Facione, 
1990; Kurfiss, 1988; Lipman, 1991; Scriven & Paul, 1996; Siegel, 1988), Ennis (2018) argued 
that they do not significantly differ from each other. Drawing from these definitions, we define 
critical thinking as purposeful, reasonable and reflective thinking that enables individuals to 
decide what to believe or what to do when facing complex and conflicting issues (Ennis, 2018; 
Facione, 1990).  
Definitions of critical thinking typically assume that critical thinking requires both skills 
and dispositions (e.g., Bailin & Siegel, 2003; Ennis, 2018; Facione, 1990; Paul, 1990). Here, 
skills are defined as the ability to coordinate multiple cognitive processes together to an end and 
include, for instance, verbal reasoning, problem-solving, and self-regulation (e.g., Halpern, 
2014). On the other hand, dispositions refer to the relatively stable traits, attitudes, and habits of 
mind that characterize those who not only possess the skills to think critically, but who use those 
skills adequately (Siegel, 1988). These dispositions include inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, 
and willingness to engage in effortful thinking, among others. Identifying the skills and 
dispositions associated with critical thinking has been the object of an important task force put 
forth by the American Philosophical Association. A panel of 46 experts and leading scholars, 
The Delphi Committee, proposed six fundamental skills associated with critical thinking, as well 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
150 
as 16 subskills and 19 dispositions. The six fundamental skills of critical thinking included 
interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation.  
Recent research has shown that specific critical thinking skills are different across 
academic disciplines (Gordon, 2000). For instance, in nursing, critical thinking is concerned with 
rigorous investigation and reflection on all aspects of a clinical situation to decide on an 
appropriate course of action (Simpson & Courtney, 2002). In engineering, critical thinking 
consists of considering assumptions in problem-solving, selecting appropriate methods for 
experiments, structuring open-ended design problems, and assessing social impacts (Claris & 
Riley, 2012). When it comes to taking a position on a socio-scientific issue such as genetically 
modified foods, the task of critical thinking rests on identifying opposing arguments, 
assumptions, and evidence, evaluating the credibility, reliability, and relevance of claims, 
producing valid explanations and arguments, and making decisions or drawing valid conclusions 
(Facione, 1990; Kuhn & Crowell, 2011). 
Bailin and Siegel (2003), as well as other philosophical theorists of critical thinking (e.g., 
Paul, 1990), emphasized the importance of generalizable abilities such as assessing reasons, 
evaluating claims, identifying underlying assumptions, and recognizing and applying valid forms 
of justification. They argue that what is “critical” about critical thinking is the use of a 
criterion—an epistemic criterion—for evaluating reasons and making sound judgments. The 
generalizable reasoning abilities described by Bailin and Siegel (2003) have long been studied by 
educational and developmental psychologists in the field of epistemic cognition (e.g., Chinn, 
Sandoval, & Samarapungavan, 2011; Greene et al., 2016; Hofer & Bendixen, 2012; King & 
Kitchener, 1994; Muis, Bendixen, Haerle, 2006). Epistemic cognition concerns individuals’ 
thoughts and beliefs about the nature of knowledge and the process of knowing (Hofer & 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
151 
Pintrich, 1997). From the perspective of educational development, Kuhn (1991, 1999) identified 
the development of epistemic cognition as perhaps the most central underpinning of critical 
thinking. However, little research on critical thinking has considered individuals’ beliefs and 
thoughts about knowledge and knowing (Alexander, 2014; Hofer, 2004; Greene & Yu, 2016). 
We next review literature that has explored relations between epistemic cognition and critical 
thinking. 
The Role of Epistemic Cognition in Critical Thinking  
Epistemic cognition. Epistemic cognition refers to how individuals vet, acquire, 
understand, justify, and use knowledge (Greene et al., 2016). Specifically, individuals engage in 
epistemic cognition when they activate personal beliefs about the nature of knowledge and 
knowing (i.e., epistemic beliefs), define epistemic aims and criteria for knowing, and use 
evaluation and justification strategies to address issues of knowledge and knowing (Barzilai & 
Zohar, 2014; Muis et al., 2018). The vast majority of research on epistemic cognition has 
focused on epistemic beliefs, which refer to individuals’ personal beliefs about the nature of 
knowledge and the process of knowing (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). Hofer and Pintrich (1997) 
proposed that epistemic beliefs comprise four dimensions: (1) the complexity of knowledge, 
ranging from the belief that knowledge consists of a simple accumulation of facts, to the belief 
that knowledge consists of a complex structure of interrelated propositions; (2) the uncertainty of 
knowledge, ranging from the belief that knowledge is certain and unchanging, to the belief that 
knowledge is tentative and evolving; (3) the sources of knowing, ranging from the view that 
knowledge resides in external authorities, to the view that individuals are knowers that actively 
construct knowledge; (4) the justification for knowing, which addresses how individuals evaluate 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
152 
knowledge claims, from an unquestioning reliance on authorities, to the evaluation and 
integration of evidence and arguments from various sources.  
Numerous empirical studies have shown that individuals who adopt more constructivist 
epistemic cognition (e.g., who believe that knowledge is complex, tentative, actively constructed, 
and justified via evaluation) use better learning strategies (Schommer, 1990), show better self-
regulation during problem solving (Muis, 2008; Muis & Franco, 2010), and attain greater 
academic performance (Schommer, Crouse, & Rhodes, 1992; Muis & Duffy, 2013) than those 
who adopt less constructivist epistemic cognition (i.e., who believe that knowledge is simple, 
certain, handed down from, and justified by authorities).  
Relations between epistemic cognition and critical thinking. Across multiple studies, 
more constructivist epistemic cognition has been positively associated with critical thinking. 
Specifically, constructivists are better at identifying the elements of discourse (i.e., assumptions, 
evidence, arguments; Mason & Boscolo, 2004) and understanding authors’ viewpoints (Barzilai 
& Eshet-Alkalai, 2015) when reading texts that comprise conflicting perspectives, compared to 
individuals with less constructivist epistemic cognition. Similarly, when contending with 
multiple sources of information, individuals with more constructivist epistemic cognition 
performed better at evaluating the trustworthiness and credibility of information using the 
features of the sources, distinguishing between types of sources, making associations between a 
source and its content, using criteria to evaluate the trustworthiness of sources, and using source 
integration strategies than those with absolutist, relativist, or less constructivist views (Barzilai & 
Zohar, 2012; Bråten, Anmarkrud, Brandmo, & Strømsø, 2014; McGinnis, 2016; Strømsø & 
Bråten, 2014).  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
153 
More constructivist beliefs about the justification for knowing have been associated with 
the use of more competent criteria to evaluate the trustworthiness of sources (Strømsø et al., 
2011). Moreover, learners with more constructivist epistemic cognition have been found to 
possess greater argumentative skills (Chan, Ho, & Ku, 2011; Mason & Boscolo, 2004; Yang & 
Tsai, 2010), which Kuhn (2018) situates as a key dimension of critical thinking. Constructivists 
are also better able to support their statements with acceptable, relevant, and multiple 
justifications (Mason & Scirica, 2006). In sum, individuals who possess more constructivist 
epistemic cognition are more likely to possess the cognitive skills necessary to think critically. In 
support of this, Muis and Duffy (2013) found that graduate students who received an 
intervention designed to develop more constructivist epistemic beliefs over the course of a 
semester also showed more critical thinking when learning statistics.  
Despite much empirical work dedicated to exploring the link between epistemic 
cognition and the skills associated with critical thinking, much less work has explored how the 
dispositions to think critically may also relate to epistemic cognition. Namely, compared to less 
constructivist epistemic cognition, more constructivist epistemic cognition has been related to the 
will to take on multiple perspectives, reconsider one’s own thinking when drawing conclusions 
about controversial issues (Schommer-Aikins & Hutter, 2002), engage in effortful thinking 
(Hyytinen, Holma, Toom, Shavelson & Lindblom-Ylänne; 2014), and display skepticism 
towards unreliable sources (McGinnis, 2016). Though motivational and affective dispositions 
have been proposed to support critical thinking (Chinn et al., 2011; Muis et al., 2015; 2018), 
researchers from both the critical thinking and epistemic cognition literature have generated 
limited research to understand how epistemic cognition relates to the affective states that dispose 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
154 
learners to think critically. We next review research that has explored the relation between 
emotions and critical thinking.  
Epistemic Emotions and Critical Thinking  
There is increasing evidence for the important role of emotions for learning processes and 
outcomes. Empirical research has related emotions to academic motivation, knowledge building 
and revision, as well as academic performance (Pekrun & Linnenbrink-Garcia, 2014). Broadly, 
emotions are defined by interrelated psychological processes that include affective (e.g., feeling 
nervous), cognitive (e.g., ruminating thoughts), motivational (e.g., a desire to escape), expressive 
(e.g., displaying a frown), and physiological (e.g., increased heart rate) components (Ellsworth, 
2013; Shuman & Scherer, 2014). Emotions can generally be classified in terms of valence, where 
pleasant emotions are positive and unpleasant emotions are negative (e.g., enjoyment is positive, 
surprise is neutral, frustration is negative), and level of activation (e.g., anxiety is activating, 
boredom is deactivating; see Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). 
In educational psychology, one important line of research has concerned achievement 
emotions, that is, emotions that are tied to achievement activities (e.g., studying) or achievement 
outcomes (success or failure), such as anxiety, pride, or shame. However, not all emotions 
triggered in educational settings are related to achievement. Notably, Pekrun and Stephens 
(2012) distinguished topic emotions, social emotions, as well as epistemic emotions. Topic 
emotions relate to the content of learning (e.g., pride when learning about the American space 
conquest), whereas social emotions focus on relations to others in the learning context (e.g., 
compassion, gratitude; Weiner, 2007). Of particular relevance to critical thinking, epistemic 
emotions relate to the perceived quality of knowledge and the processing of information (Pekrun 
& Stephens, 2012).  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
155 
Muis et al. (2018) proposed that epistemic emotions arise as the result of appraisals of 
alignment or misalignment between the characteristics of incoming messages and individuals’ 
cognitive characteristics, including prior knowledge, epistemic beliefs, and epistemic aims. In 
the context of contending with socio-scientific issues such as climate change, vaccination, or 
genetically modified foods, incoming messages are likely to be characterized by knowledge 
claims that are complex that also include a degree of uncertainty (Levinson, 2006). For 
individuals seeking simple and certain answers, engaging with such content may trigger a variety 
of epistemic emotions such as confusion, frustration, or anxiety. However, facing the same 
content, individuals who expect knowledge to be uncertain and tentative, and who see value in 
consulting multiple sources before coming to a conclusion, may experience curiosity and 
enjoyment (Chevrier et al., under review; Muis et al., 2015). When presented with tasks that 
engage individuals’ beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing, frequently occurring 
epistemic emotions include surprise, curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, frustration, anxiety, and 
boredom (Muis et al., 2015; Pekrun et al., 2017).  
Surprise is likely to occur when individuals appraise new information as unexpected 
(e.g., Meyer, Reisenzein, & Schützwohl, 1997) or when they are unable to generate an 
explanation for the new information (e.g., Foster & Keane, 2015). Mildly surprising information 
can lead to deep processing and integration of information, whereas information that is greatly 
surprising can be regarded as implausible and new information may fail to be integrated 
(Munnich & Ramney, 2018). When information is not overly complex or perceived as relatively 
comprehensible, curiosity may arise. Litman (2008) proposes that epistemic curiosity arises in 
one of two forms: as a pleasant desire for information (i.e., interest-type curiosity), or as an 
unpleasant urge to obtain information to close the gap between what one knows and what one 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
156 
wants to know (e.g., deprivation-type curiosity; see also Loewenstein, 1994; Markey & 
Lowenstein, 2012). If the course of curiosity is followed, enjoyment may ensue, for instance, 
when validation or verification of a hypothesis is achieved (Brun & Kuenzel, 2008), or when an 
epistemic aim is achieved (Chinn et al., 2011; Muis et al., 2018). Confusion, on the other hand, 
follows from a lack of understanding when novel and complex information is perceived as 
incomprehensible (Muis et al., 2018). Confusion can also arise in the face of severe 
discrepancies or contradictions, or from a disruption of goals or sequences of action (D’Mello & 
Graesser, 2012; Ellsworth, 2003). If an individual repeatedly fails to resolve the discrepancy 
causing confusion, frustration may arise (D’Mello & Graesser, 2012). Frustration can be 
described as a blend of anger and disappointment and, as such, can be an activating emotion 
when closer to anger, or deactivating if closer to disappointment (Pekrun et al., 2002). 
Another negative emotion is anxiety, which arises when a message implicates knowledge 
that is core to one’s identity. Individuals may begin to doubt or feel uncertain about their beliefs 
in a proposition, and feel that their identity is threatened (Hookway, 2008). Pekrun (2002, 2006) 
described anxiety as a “complex” emotion that can either benefit or hinder motivation to engage 
in effortful thinking. On the one hand, anxiety can reduce cognitive resources such as memory, 
leading to poor performance on complex or difficult tasks, as well as poor academic achievement 
(see Pekrun et al., 2002; Zeidner, 2014). However, for some individuals, anxiety can increase 
extrinsic motivation to invest effort in complex processes such as analytical and critical thinking 
to avoid goal-related failure. Lastly, boredom may arise when information is unchallenging 
(Chevrier et al., under review) or when an intense negative emotion like frustration or anxiety 
precipitates disengagement (D’Mello et al., 2014).  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
157 
Consequences of epistemic emotions. Pekrun (Pekrun et al., 2002; Pekrun, 2006; 
Pekrun & Perry, 2014) proposed that individuals process information in emotion-congruent 
ways. Specifically, Pekrun and colleagues proposed that positive emotions (e.g., interest-type 
curiosity, enjoyment) signal that the object of judgment is valuable, leading to more positive 
evaluations, greater efforts to engage, more elaboration of content, and more purposeful thinking 
than negative emotions. On the other hand, negative emotions (e.g., frustration, anxiety, 
boredom) have been related to more negative evaluations, fewer efforts to engage (anxiety may 
be an exception), less elaboration of content, and more irrelevant thinking (see Pekrun et al., 
2002 for a review). Further, positive emotions have been found to facilitate holistic, intuitive, 
and creative ways of thinking, whereas negative emotions have been associated to more focused, 
detail-oriented, analytical, and rigid modes of processing information (e.g., Bless et al., 1996).  
Thus, critical thinking is theorized to be facilitated by optimal levels of surprise and 
positive emotions such as curiosity and enjoyment, and hindered by certain negative emotions 
such as frustration and boredom. On the other hand, other negative emotions such as anxiety and 
confusion may be beneficial for critical thinking: D’Mello and Graesser (2014) argued that 
confusion is central to complex learning activities such as problem-solving and generating 
cohesive arguments. As such, confusion is expected to be beneficial to critical thinking because 
it signals that there is something wrong with the current state of affairs, which can precipitate 
critical thinking. Similarly, anxiety in the face of complex and conflicting information may 
motivate critical thinking via effortful thinking to reduce the discomfort of anxiety. 
 
Empirical evidence. To date, little theoretical and empirical work has explored how 
epistemic cognition relates to epistemic emotions experienced when contending with complex or 
conflicting information. To address this gap, Muis et al. (2015) examined relations between 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
158 
epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, learning strategies—including critical thinking—and 
learning achievement in the context of learning about climate change. They hypothesized that 
individuals with more constructivist beliefs would experience more positive emotions given the 
consistency between the to-be-learned content and their epistemic beliefs, whereas individuals 
with less constructivist beliefs would experience more negative emotions given the conflicting 
perspectives presented to them on the causes and consequences of climate change. Results from 
path analyses revealed that individuals who espoused more constructivist epistemic beliefs about 
the justification for knowing used more critical thinking strategies, and that this relationship was 
mediated by curiosity: The more learners believed that knowledge is justified by systematic 
inquiry and integration of sources of information, the more they experienced curiosity and, in 
turn, the more they used critical thinking and attained greater learning achievement. They also 
found that surprise negatively predicted critical thinking, but surprise was not predicted by any 
epistemic belief dimension. 
Advancing this line of research, Chevrier et al. (under review) used think-aloud protocol 
to capture online epistemic emotions and learning strategies, including critical thinking, in the 
context of learning about climate change. State-transition analyses were conducted to explore 
how epistemic emotions transitioned into learning strategies. They found that surprise 
significantly increased the likelihood of critical thinking. However, a path analysis testing for 
relations between self-reported epistemic beliefs, self-reported epistemic emotions, online 
learning strategies, and learning achievement showed that surprise negatively predicted critical 
thinking. Results also showed that more constructivist epistemic beliefs about the justification 
for knowing predicted critical thinking via more curiosity and less boredom.

In sum, significant relations between epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and 
critical thinking are suggested in the literature. However, the studies reviewed were 
predominately designed to assess relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, and 
critical thinking during learning; they did not instruct participants to think critically. As Greene 
et al. (2014) argued, the study of epistemic cognition and critical thinking should involve the 
need to argue for, and justify, conclusions drawn across sources and perspectives. As such, to 
fully understand the role of epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions in critical thinking, more 
research is needed that assesses these constructs in appropriate settings. To address this gap in 
the literature, the current study sought to examine relations between epistemic beliefs, epistemic 
emotions, and critical thinking in the context of producing a critical argument about a socio-
scientific topic.  
The Current Study 
 
On the basis of theoretical and empirical considerations from Muis, Pekrun, and 
colleagues (Chevrier et al., under review; Muis et al., 2015, 2018; Pekrun et al., 2002; Pekrun, 
2006; Pekrun et al., 2017), as well as from the work of D’Mello and colleagues (D’Mello & 
Graesser, 2012; D’Mello et al., 2014), we propose the following hypotheses (see Figure 1): 
Hypothesis 1: Epistemic beliefs will predict critical thinking. Specifically, more 
constructivist beliefs will positively predict critical thinking, and less constructivist epistemic 
beliefs will negatively predict critical thinking. 
Hypothesis 2: Epistemic beliefs will predict epistemic emotions. Specifically, more 
constructivist epistemic beliefs will positively predict positive epistemic emotions, including 
interest-type curiosity and enjoyment, and negatively predict surprise and negative emotions, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
160 
including confusion, frustration, anxiety and boredom. In contrast, less constructivist epistemic 
beliefs will predict surprise as well as less positive emotions and more negative emotions.  
Hypothesis 3: Epistemic emotions will predict critical thinking. Specifically, surprise, 
curiosity, enjoyment, confusion, and anxiety will positively predict critical thinking, whereas 
frustration and boredom will negatively predict critical thinking.  
Hypothesis 4: Epistemic emotions will mediate relations between epistemic beliefs and 
critical thinking.  
To test these hypotheses, we designed a study that specifically embedded a task that 
challenged individuals to critically evaluate knowledge claims from opposing perspectives, and 
to take position on the topic in the form of an argumentative essay. The topic selected was 
genetically modified foods. Participants first took a knowledge assessment test to assess baseline 
knowledge about genetically modified foods and reported epistemic beliefs, then read a text on 
genetically modified foods that was comprised of two parts. The first part of the text was 
informative in nature and written in the style of a refutation text to ensure that all participants 
would engage in essay writing with good baseline knowledge about the nature of genetically 
modified foods. Refutation texts address commonly held misconceptions and directly refute them 
by presenting correct scientific explanations (Sinatra & Broughton, 2011). The effectiveness of 
refutation texts for facilitating the revision of misconceptions has been well documented (see 
Tippett, 2010). The second part of the text was argumentative in nature and presented a series of 
points in favor for and against genetically modified foods. These points were supported by 
evidence that varied in strength and degree of certainty, but all information provided was valid as 
of November 2015 (when the materials for this study were developed and data were collected).

After having read the experimental text, participants wrote an argumentative essay in favor for or 
against genetically modified foods.  
Method 
Participants 
 
Two hundred four university students participated. Participants were recruited from three 
research-intensive universities from Eastern Canada (40.7%), Western Canada (26.5%), and the 
Southern United States (32.8%). No differences between groups were found on any of the 
variables of interest as a function of location. Of the combined sample, 66.2% reported as 
female, and 33.8% as male. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 54% of participants 
identifying as Asian, 25% as White, 9.5% as Latino or Hispanic, 3.6% as Black or African-
American, and 1.2% as Native, Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. Overall, 61.2% of participants 
learned English as a second of foreign language, with 71.2% of these participants reporting that 
they had learned to speak and write English before the age of 10. No effects of whether or not 
English was the first language spoken or written were found on any of the variables of interest. 
Participants studied a variety of domains (e.g., business administration, social sciences, natural 
sciences, computer sciences, psychology, linguistics, arts) and reported an average GPA of 3.24 
out 4.0 (SD = .55). Participants from the Western Canadian institution reported significantly 
lower GPA (M = 2.97, SD = .67) than participants from the Eastern Canadian (M = 3.43, SD = 
.44) and Southern American institutions (M = 3.30, SD = .39; F(2, 124) = 10.02, p < .001). 
Overall, no significant differences were observed between Canadian (M = 3.23, SD = .60) versus 
American (M = 3.30, SD = .39) participants in terms of reported GPA. Participants were 21.46 
years of age on average (SD = 4.28).

Experimental text. Participants were given a text that first presented factual information 
about genetically modified foods, followed by a portion that presented advantages and 
disadvantages of genetically modified foods (see Appendix F). The first half of the text was 
adapted from Heddy, Danielson, Sinatra, and Graham (2017) and focused on debunking four 
common misconceptions about genetically modified foods by presenting accurate scientific 
explanations. Erroneous conceptions included the notion that genetically modifying food is the 
same process as cloning, that it involves injecting hormones into a plant or animal, that it only 
occurs in laboratories by scientists, and that it is the product of contemporary scientific research.  
The second part of the text presented four advantages of, and four criticisms against 
genetically modified foods. It was written by the second author and adapted from content 
published by the Canadian Standards Association (Whitman, 2000). To counterbalance a 
possible effect of text order with regard to the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages 
of genetically modified foods, two versions of the text were created: one version presented the 
advantages first, followed by the disadvantages, and the other version presented the 
disadvantages first, then the advantages. The text contained 1295 words in total, including the 
informative and argumentative sections, with a Flesch-Kincaid index of grade 12.7 and a Flesch 
Reading Ease index of 37.7.  
Prior knowledge test. Participants’ prior knowledge about genetically modified foods 
was measured with a 10-item multiple-choice test adapted from Heddy et al. (2017; see 
Appendix G). Each question presented four possible choices and participants were instructed to 
select the best answer. Correct answers were given a score of 1 and incorrect answers were given 
a score of 0. Scores were then added to create a total sum, then a percentage, which was used as 
an indicator of prior knowledge.

A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine the factor structure of 
the prior knowledge test using Mplus Version 7.11 (Muthén & Muthén, 2015). The initial model 
revealed a poor fit, c2 = 103.94, df = 35, p < .001, RMSEA = .05, and CFI = .88. An analysis of 
item loadings revealed low loadings for two items; therefore, these items were deleted. The final 
model (with the remaining eight items) resulted in a good fit, c2 = 64.14, df = 20, p < .01, CFI = 
.94 and RMSEA = .04. Cronbach’s reliability coefficient was acceptable, α = .79. 
Epistemic beliefs. Epistemic beliefs about genetically modified foods were measured 
with a version of TSEBQ (Bråten & Strømsø, 2009) adapted to this topic (see Appendix H). The 
TSEBQ comprises 24 items that participants rate on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Four dimensions of epistemic beliefs were measured: six 
items assessed beliefs about the complexity of knowledge (e.g., “Knowledge about genetic 
modification is primarily characterized by a large amount of detailed information”), six items 
assessed beliefs about the uncertainty of knowledge (e.g., “Certain knowledge about genetic 
modification is rare”), five items assessed beliefs about the source of knowing (e.g., “I often feel 
that I just have to accept that what I read about genetic modification problems can be trusted”), 
and seven items assessed beliefs about justification for knowing (e.g., “When I read about issues 
concerning genetic modification, I evaluate whether the content seems logical”).  
A CFA was conducted to examine the factorial validity of scores for the instrument using 
Mplus7. The initial model (with 24 items) showed poor fit, c2 = 419.25, df = 246, p < .001, 
RMSEA = .06, and CFI = .78. Due to low loadings, 10 items were deleted: three items were 
removed from the uncertainty subscale, three from the complexity subscale, two from the source 
subscale, and three from the justification subscale. The final model (with 14 dimensions) resulted 
in good fit, c2 = 102.31, df = 71, p < .001, RMSEA = .05, and CFI = .93. Cronbach’s reliability 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
164 
coefficients were acceptable, α = .69 for the uncertainty subscale; α = .68 for the complexity 
subscale; α = .68 for the source subscale, and .76 for the justification subscale.  
Epistemic emotions. Epistemic emotions experienced while reading the experimental 
text were measured with the EES (Pekrun et al., 2017; see Appendix D). This questionnaire 
comprises 21 items that measure seven epistemic emotions, including: surprise, curiosity, 
enjoyment, confusion, frustration, anxiety, and boredom. Each item consisted of a single word 
describing one emotion, with three descriptors per emotion (e.g., “anxious,” “nervous,” and 
“worried” measured anxiety). Participants rated the intensity of their emotional responses to the 
text using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Not at all” to “Very strong.” The scores for the 
descriptors of each emotion were averaged to represent each emotion. 
A CFA was conducted to examine the factorial validity of scores for the instrument using 
Mplus7. The initial model (with 7 dimensions) revealed a poor fit, c2 = 419.18, df = 168, p < 
.001, RMSEA = .09, and CFI = .89. Due to low loadings, six items were removed: one from the 
curiosity subscale, one from the enjoyment subscale, one from the confusion subscale, one from 
the frustration subscale, and one from the boredom subscale. The final model resulted in good fit, 
c2 = 134.60, df = 69, p < .001, RMSEA = .07, and CFI = .95. Final Cronbach’s reliability 
coefficients were acceptable, α = .74 for surprise; α = .80 for curiosity; α = .83 for enjoyment; α 
= .76 for confusion; α = .84 for frustration; α = .84 for anxiety; α = .77 for boredom. 
 
Essay. To assess critical thinking, participants were instructed to compose a brief essay 
in favor for or against genetically modified foods and to justify their position. Instructions were 
as follows: “Based on the content you just read, write a brief (2-3 paragraphs) argument for or 
against genetically modified foods. Explain how you came to form and justify your point of 
view. You can refer back to the text you read, and include your judgment of the arguments, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
165 
evidence, and conclusions it presented.” Critical thinking was assessed using a coding scheme 
developed for this purpose. 
Coding critical thinking in essays. A coding scheme was developed by the first author 
to assess critical thinking in argumentative essays. The coding scheme was informed by the work 
of Facione and Facione (2014; see Table 13 for full descriptions and examples). Five elements 
were targeted via the coding scheme: taking a position, presenting supportive arguments in favor 
of a position, acknowledging an alternative perspective, evaluating the validity of claims on both 
sides of the issue, and integrating arguments from opposing viewpoints into a coherent 
perspective or conclusion. One point was attributed if participants took a position; no points were 
attributed if participants did not take a position. One point was attributed if participants 
supported their position with valid arguments, evidence, facts or reasons; no points were 
attributed if no arguments were presented in support of their position or if arguments were 
invalid. One point was attributed if participants acknowledged and presented an alternative 
perspective on genetically modified foods; no points were attributed if participants only 
presented arguments in favor of one perspective. One point was attributed if participants 
evaluated claims or arguments before accepting them as valid; no points were attributed if 
participants expediently accepted or dismissed claims or arguments without evaluation. Lastly, 
one point was attributed if participants reconciled or integrated perspectives; no points were 
attributed if the conclusion was one-sided, categorical, or failed to acknowledge the validity of 
any counter-argument. Points were summed to create a total score on five.  
The coding scheme was tested by the first and last authors using 31 transcripts (15% of 
the sample), and inter-rater reliability for the first round was established at 75%. All 
disagreements were resolved through discussion and were used to update the coding scheme. A 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
166 
second round of coding was performed, and final inter-rater reliability was established at 88%. 
The first author then coded the remainder of the essays.  
Procedure 
 
Participants provided informed consent to participate in the study and then completed the 
prior knowledge test and the TSEBQ to assess epistemic beliefs. Participants were then randomly 
assigned to read a version of the text that presented the advantages of genetically modified foods 
first (n = 102), or the disadvantages of genetically modified foods first (n = 102). After reading, 
participants completed the EES to capture the epistemic emotions they experienced while 
reading. Lastly, participants composed an argumentative essay and then completed a 
demographics questionnaire to conclude the study1. Participants were compensated for their time 
with $15 cash, a $10 gift card, or course credit, depending on the location of the study. 
Results 
Preliminary Analyses 
Prior to conducting full analyses, all variables were inspected for skewness and kurtosis. 
Based on Tabachnick and Fidell’s (2013) recommendations, acceptable ranges of ±3 for 
skewness and ±8 for kurtosis were used to investigate the relative normality of the distributions 
for each variable. Analyses revealed that the distributions for confusion (4.45), frustration (7.28), 
anxiety (3.73), and boredom (6.10) were positively skewed; however, given the nature of 
                                                        
 
 
 
1 Other measures were included in the study for the purposes of the larger study. Additional 
measures taken before learning included dietary self-concept, task value and self-efficacy for 
learning about GMF, prior attitude towards GMF, and baseline emotions about GMF. Additional 
measures taken after learning included learning strategies used while reading and final attitude 
towards GMF. Participants also completed two knowledge tests and an argument identification 
task prior to writing the argumentative essay.

emotions, normal distributions for these variables are unlikely, so the variables were retained for 
subsequent analyses. Examination of text order (i.e., advantages of genetically modified foods 
first or disadvantages of genetically modified foods first) showed no effect on all variables. 
Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in Table 14 and correlations between 
variables are presented in Table 15.  
To check for univariate outliers, each variable was converted to a standardized z-score. 
Any z-scores exceeding critical cut-offs of ±3.3 was considered an outlier (Tabachnick & Fidell, 
2013). Results revealed univariate outliers for justification (n = 2, z = -3.36 to -5.53) and 
frustration (n = 1, z = 3.51). Instead of deletion, all cases were retained given the values were not 
extreme and did not exceed more than 2% of cases for each variable (see Cohen, Cohen, West, & 
Aiken, 2003). To check for multivariate outliers, Mahalanobis distances were calculated based 
on a χ2 distribution with 12 degrees of freedom and a critical cut-off point of 32.91 (α = .001; see 
Meyers, Gamest, & Guarino, 2017; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Three participants were 
removed from the sample for a total of 201 participants included in subsequent analyses. Lastly, 
an inspection of a bivariate correlation matrix using a recommended critical cut-off point of .70 
(see Meyers et al., 2017) revealed one instance of multicollinearity in the data between confusion 
and curiosity (r = .86, p < .01). Given this finding, curiosity was removed from subsequent 
analyses to mitigate any potential confounding effect. 
Mediation Path Analysis 
To test the hypothesized mediation model depicted in Figure 3, we conducted a mediation 
analysis using Hayes and Preachers’ (2013) MEDIATE macro for SPSS, which is recommended 
for testing complex mediational models and maintaining high power while controlling for Type I 
error rates (see Hayes & Preacher, 2013). Bootstrap sampling was used (with 5000 bootstraps), 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS

which does not require assumptions of normality and which was appropriate given a few slightly 
skewed variables. To examine the direct and indirect predictive relations between epistemic 
beliefs, epistemic emotions and critical thinking, mediation analysis was conducted. This allows 
the estimation of all direct predictive effects of four epistemic beliefs and six epistemic emotions 
simultaneously on critical thinking. A power analysis using G*Power (Faul & Erdfelder, 1992; 
for a full description, see Erdfelder, Faul, & Buchner, 1996) with power (1— β) set at .80 and α 
set at .05 revealed a required sample size of 218 for the present analysis. Given a sample of 201, 
the analysis would be underpowered. As such, we adjusted the level of the confidence intervals 
to 90% for the bootstrap sampling, which required a sample size of 180. The final model is 
depicted in Figure 4 with standardized effects. 
We first examined the total effects model, which expresses the sum of the direct and 
indirect effects of epistemic beliefs on critical thinking scores to determine the predictive 
relations between epistemic beliefs and critical thinking, independent of the effects of 
mediational variables. We next calculated the direct effects of epistemic beliefs on epistemic 
emotions, the direct effects of epistemic beliefs on critical thinking, and the indirect effects of 
epistemic beliefs on critical thinking via epistemic emotions. At each step, we controlled for the 
effects of prior knowledge.  
The total effects model for epistemic beliefs and critical thinking was significant, F(5, 
195) = 3.16, p = .009, R2 = .075. Complexity beliefs (b = .22, SE = .09, t = 2.36, p = .019) and 
uncertainty beliefs (b = .22, SE = .09, t = 2.34, p = .02) were direct predictors of critical thinking. 
For direct effects of epistemic beliefs on epistemic emotions, complexity beliefs negatively 
predicted surprise (b = -.22, SE = .07, t = -3.07, p = .003), confusion (b = -.18, SE = .05, t = -

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
169 
3.32, p = .001), and frustration, (b = -.13, SE = .07, t = -1.87, p = .063), and source beliefs 
positively predicted frustration, (b = .17, SE = .07, t = 2.42, p = .017). 
The full mediational analysis of the direct and indirect effects of epistemic beliefs and 
epistemic emotions on critical thinking was significant, F(11, 189) = 2.67, p = .003, R2 = .134, 
indicating that epistemic beliefs and epistemic emotions together accounted for 13.4% of the 
variance associated with critical thinking. With epistemic emotions entered in the model, 
complexity beliefs (b = .23, SE = .09, t = 2.40, p = .017) and uncertainty beliefs (b = .20, SE = 
.09, t = 2.12, p = .036) remained significant predictors of critical thinking. As for epistemic 
emotions, confusion (b = .28, SE = .17, t = 1.68, p = .095) and anxiety (b = .25, SE = .14, t = 
1.81, p = .072) were significant positive predictors, and frustration (b = -.26, SE = .13, t = -1.99, 
p = .048) and boredom (b = -.21, SE = .11, t = -1.98, p = .049) were significant negative 
predictors of critical thinking. 
For indirect effects of epistemic beliefs on critical thinking via epistemic emotions, two 
significant mediation paths were identified. Results showed that the effect of complexity beliefs 
on critical thinking was mediated by confusion, with a point estimate of -.05 and bias corrected 
bootstrapped confidence intervals (90%) of -.107 to -.003. Further, the effects of source beliefs 
on critical thinking were mediated by frustration, with a point estimate of -.043 and bias 
corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals (90%) of -.106 to -.002. Contrary to predictions, the 
direction of these mediation paths was negative. Namely, more constructivist uncertainty beliefs 
negatively related to critical thinking via less confusion, and more constructivist source beliefs 
negatively related to critical thinking via more frustration. 
Two Illustrative Cases 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
170 
The following cases reflect examples of how epistemic beliefs and epistemic emotions 
related to critical thinking for different individuals. These cases were chosen as they represent 
individuals with similar demographic profiles and levels of prior knowledge about genetically 
modified foods, but whose epistemic beliefs and emotions as well as critical thinking skills 
present an interesting contrast.  
Case 1. Case 1 was a 24-year-old female in the 3rd year of an environmental sciences 
degree with a self-reported GPA representing an academic average between 80%-84% (or A-). 
Case 1’s prior knowledge about genetically modified foods was below average (test score = 
20.00%). She reported epistemic beliefs that were slightly less constructivist than average on the 
complexity subscale (score = 3.33/7.00), less constructivist than average by more than two 
standard deviations on the uncertainty subscale (score = 2.83/7.00), and less constructivist than 
average on the source subscale by one standard deviation (score = 2.60/7.00). For epistemic 
emotions, she reported slightly less confusion than average (score = 1.33/5.00), slightly more 
frustration than average (score = 2.00/5.00), more anxiety than average by more than one 
standard deviation (score = 3.33/5.00), and more boredom than average by more than a standard 
deviation (score = 3.00/5.00).  
Our analysis of Case 1’s essay indicated little critical thinking (score = 2/5) and reflected 
a one-sided view of genetically modified foods. Her essay included a well-positioned positive 
stance on genetically modified foods (“Genetically modified food is the way of the future”) as 
well as a few arguments in its support (“For instance, rice can be GM to have more nutrients, 
thus preventing millions of people from starvation” and “Already there are many Third World 
nations that have hungry and malnourished populations. Genetically modified foods can help 
them by modifying their staple of food grown there.”) However, Case 1 did not identify nor 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
171 
engage with arguments from the opposing position. No arguments against genetically modified 
foods were specifically identified. Only the fact that genetically modified foods could have 
detrimental health effects was alluded to in a sentence that quickly dismissed the counter-
argument with a statement that was justified by means of not having directly observed any 
opposing evidence: “Every day, there are hundreds of foods being bought in grocery stores that 
are GM and so far there have been no significant real downside to eating it (detrimental). In fact, 
I'm sure you've even eaten something that's been GM this week!” Further, no conclusions were 
reached that hinted to integration or reconciliation of perspectives. A conclusive statement was 
offered that solidified a position in favor of genetically modified foods (“Our knowledge is 
meant to be passed on to others so they can benefit from the fortunes that we are so lucky to 
have.”). Overall, Case 1 is representative of individuals with overall less constructivist epistemic 
beliefs who did not present elaborate critical thinking. Further, though prior knowledge was low, 
Case 1 reported little confusion. She also reported high levels of anxiety and boredom. Given 
that high has been being linked to increased efforts for analytical thinking (see Pekrun et al., 
2002), it might be the case that repression of anxiety played an important role in this case.   
Case 2. Case 2 was a 24-year-old female in the 2nd year of a degree in psychology. She 
reported a GPA representing an academic average between 85%-89% (or A). Akin to Case 1, 
Case 2’s prior knowledge about genetically modified foods was below average (test score = 
20%). She reported epistemic beliefs that were more constructivist than average by more than 
one standard deviation on the uncertainty subscale (score = 5.00/7.00), more constructivist 
beliefs than average by more than one standard deviation on the uncertainty subscale (score = 
5.83/7.00), and slightly less constructivist beliefs than average on the source subscale (score = 
4.00/7.00). For epistemic emotions, she reported more confusion than average by more than one 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
172 
standard deviation (score = 3.00/5.00), more frustration than average by more than one standard 
deviation (score = 2.67/5.00), slightly more anxiety than average (score = 3.00/5.00), and slightly 
less boredom than average (score = 1.67/5.00).  
Case 2’s essay reflected an integrated perspective on genetically modified foods. Case 2 
first assumed a cautiously positive stance on genetically modified foods (“Though the use of 
genetically modified foods may present possible solutions to certain of the world's problems, 
there is insufficient research on the matter and, more specifically, evidence supporting its 
proposed benefits.”) She then presented some of benefits of genetically modified foods 
(“Genetically modified foods have been proposed to aid in addressing the many problems tied to 
the ever-growing population of the world, including malnutrition and land usage”) and then 
exposed some criticism, pointing to a lack of supportive evidence (“However, these are mere 
propositions based on hypothetical scenarios [i.e., there is no evidence to show that certain foods 
can be genetically modified to provide additional vitamins and minerals - what has been 
proposed is a hypothetical solution.]”). The same pattern was repeated with the opposing 
perspective: Case 2 first presented arguments against genetically modified foods (“Meanwhile, a 
growing body of research is pointing to evidence supporting its harmful side effects. For 
instance, a causal link was found between the presence of the modified B.t. corn and death of 
monarch butterfly caterpillars. Research has also shown that GM fed rats had digestive tracts that 
differed to rats fed unmodified foods”), then identified limitations (“While research on the 
effects of GM foods in humans is still rather limited, such animal studies are an important 
start.”). A full reconciliation of perspectives was not reached, but a conclusion was drawn that 
followed the aforementioned evaluations and identified a lack of evidence as a halt to fully 
embracing the benefits of genetically modified foods (“Overall, the research on genetically 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
173 
modified foods remains inconsistent and limited. There is insufficient evidence to show that the 
benefits of genetically modified foods could outweigh its costs.”). It may be the case that an 
optimal level of anxiety and confusion, combined with low boredom, motivated Case 2 to exert 
efforts to analyze each perspective on genetically modified foods, in order to better understand 
their characteristics and nuances, resulting in observable critical thoughts. 
Discussion 
 
Socio-scientific issues such as genetically modified foods are often depicted as 
controversial by influencers who are either in favor or against the propositions of scientific 
expertise. In the face of such issues, successful critical thinking occurs when individuals 
purposefully decide what to believe or what to do by evaluating knowledge claims and 
reconciling opposing views, taking relevant evidence and context into account (Ennis, 1987; 
Facione, 1990). Prior theoretical and empirical work suggests that individuals’ thoughts and 
beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing play an important role in supporting critical 
thinking. However, little is known about the role that knowledge- and knowing-related emotions 
may play in epistemic cognition and critical thinking. We hypothesized that epistemic cognition 
supports critical thinking via availing epistemic emotions. 
This research contributes to the literature on epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions 
by empirically testing Muis et al.’s (2015, 2018) model of epistemic cognition and epistemic 
emotions, and by providing new findings concerning relations between epistemic cognition, 
epistemic emotions, and critical thinking. Further, this study is the first to explore these relations 
in the context of an elaborate critical thinking task where participants were asked to decide what 
to believe about a socio-scientific issue on the basis of conflicting evidence. Specifically, results 
showed that a belief in complex and uncertain knowledge directly predicted critical thinking 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
174 
(Hypothesis 1). Complexity and source beliefs also predicted epistemic emotions, including 
surprise, confusion, and frustration (Hypothesis 2), and several epistemic emotions (i.e., 
confusion, frustration, anxiety, and boredom) in turn predicted critical thinking (Hypothesis 3). 
Lastly, confusion and frustration mediated relations between epistemic beliefs and critical 
thinking (Hypothesis 4). Next, we interpret each of the results described above and conclude 
with a discussion of limitations and directions for future research.  
Effects of Epistemic Beliefs When Facing Socio-Scientific Issues 
 
In support of our hypothesis, more constructivist epistemic beliefs about the nature of 
knowledge (complexity and uncertainty dimensions) significantly predicted critical thinking, 
indicating that the more individuals believed in complex and tentative knowledge, the more they 
presented support for arguments, acknowledged alternatives, evaluated claims, and drew 
balanced conclusions. However, epistemic beliefs about the nature of knowing (beliefs about the 
sources of, and justification for knowing) were not significantly related to critical thinking. It 
should be mentioned that it is frequent in epistemic belief research that not all belief dimensions 
are salient in a given situation, depending on the nature of the task (Greene et al., 2010; Hammer 
& Elby, 2002; Muis et al., 2006). Similar to this study, Strømsø, Bråten and Britt (2011) 
examined relations between epistemic beliefs and undergraduate students’ evaluations of 
documents’ trustworthiness and found that source beliefs significantly predicted evaluation of 
conflicting claims, but justification beliefs did not contribute significantly to trustworthiness 
scores.  
 
Two dimensions of epistemic beliefs were found to have direct effects on three epistemic 
emotions, though the direction of these relations were variable. In particular, in line with 
hypotheses, the more individuals believed that knowledge about genetically modified foods is 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
175 
complex, the less likely there were to experience surprise, confusion, and frustration. This 
supports the notion that epistemic beliefs shape individuals’ assumptions about the nature of 
knowledge (Muis, 2007), such that those who expected knowledge about genetically modified 
foods to be simple may have experienced dissonance related to the complex nature of 
information presented in the text, and thus reported higher levels of surprise, confusion, and 
frustration. However, contrary to hypothesis, an unexpected relation was found between source 
beliefs and frustration: The more individuals viewed personal interpretations and judgments as 
the main sources of knowledge about genetically modified foods, the more they experienced 
frustration when reading contradictory perspectives about the value and usefulness of genetically 
modified foods. This result is consistent with findings from Strømsø et al. (2011) who found that 
the more students viewed the self as a meaning maker, the less they trusted texts written by 
climate change experts. Similarly, Kardash and Scholes (1996) found that the less students 
believed in external authority as a source of knowledge, the stronger their opinions about the 
HIV-AIDS relationship.  
It could be the case that individuals who believe that knowledge resides within the self 
(and who have low prior knowledge) also prefer to fall back on their own opinions and find it 
frustrating to have to consider the point of view of others. Traditionally, the belief that 
knowledge originates from external authorities has been viewed as “naïve,” whereas the 
conception of self as a knower has been viewed as “sophisticated” (Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). 
However, researchers have called into question the assumption that more constructivist beliefs 
are better to espouse in all situations (see Bromme, Kienhues, & Stalh, 2008; Greene et al., 2010; 
Greene & Yu, 2014). Indeed, when novices face a complex topic such as genetically modified 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
176 
foods, it may be adaptive to assume that experts are trustworthy and to balance one’s own 
judgments with reliance on external expert sources.  
Lastly, it should be noted that contrary to hypothesis, more constructivist complexity 
beliefs did not significantly predict more enjoyment when reading about advantages and 
disadvantages of genetically modified foods. Following Muis et al.’s (2018) model of epistemic 
cognition and epistemic emotions, we hypothesized that enjoyment would stem from an 
alignment between epistemic beliefs that are congruent with the nature of science (i.e., more 
constructivist epistemic beliefs) and the epistemic nature of the material presented. Similarly, 
Franco et al. (2011) found that when individuals’ epistemic beliefs are consistent with the 
knowledge representations in complex learning material, they perform better on various 
measures, including deep processing of information, text recall, and changes in misconceptions. 
However, Muis et al. (2018) suggested that epistemic emotions have more antecedents than were 
measured here, including perceptions of control and task value, as well as information novelty 
and complexity. They argued that if an individual with more constructivist epistemic beliefs has 
low perceived control or assigns little value to the task at hand, then he or she may experience 
lower levels of enjoyment. This suggests that epistemic beliefs alone cannot fully predict the 
type of epistemic emotions that are likely to arise in a given situation. As such, to fully 
understand the relationship between epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions more broadly, 
future work should include other epistemic emotion antecedents and take further contextual 
elements into account. 
The Mediating Role of Epistemic Emotions in Critical Thinking  
 
One important contribution of the current study is evidence that epistemic emotions play 
a role in mediating the relationship between epistemic cognition and critical thinking, thus 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
177 
providing support to Muis et al.’s (2015, 2018) model of epistemic emotions. Specifically, 
confusion mediated relations between complexity beliefs and critical thinking, and frustration 
mediated relations between source beliefs and critical thinking. However, the mediating role of 
epistemic emotions in the relationship between epistemic cognition and critical thinking was 
found to be more complex than first anticipated.  
Consistent with the contention that confusion can be beneficial for complex cognitive 
tasks, confusion was found to be a positive predictor of critical thinking. Also consistent with 
hypotheses, confusion was negatively predicted by complexity beliefs and, as such, fully 
mediated relations between complexity beliefs and critical thinking. Although the full mediation 
effect seems to suggest that more constructivist complexity beliefs are detrimental to critical 
thinking via decreased levels of confusion, we suggest that the relations revealed here are more 
complex than they appear. It might be the case that compared to individuals with less 
constructivist epistemic beliefs, those who espouse more constructivist complexity beliefs 
experience less confusion related to the complex nature of genetically modified foods 
knowledge, but nevertheless perceive discrepancies between perspectives that can trigger levels 
of confusion that are beneficial for critical thinking. Indeed, philosophers such as Morton (2010) 
and Elgin (2008) have argued that epistemic emotions such as surprise and confusion can draw 
attention to the object of the emotion, which can lead to deep processing of information as well 
as metacognitive self-regulation (Muis et al., 2015). However, confusion can increase one’s 
cognitive load, leaving few attentional resources to resolve the complex situation at hand 
(D’Mello & Graesser, 2014; Meinhardt & Pekrun, 2003), which can be detrimental for complex 
cognitive processes. To clarify how epistemic beliefs and confusion relate to critical thinking, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
178 
future work is needed to shed light on what distinguishes beneficial forms from detrimental 
forms of confusion. To this end, qualitative work may be a fruitful avenue. 
Further, the relationship between source belief and critical thinking was fully mediated 
by frustration. Frustration was found to be a negative predictor of critical thinking; however, 
frustration was positively related to the belief of the self as a knower, which raises questions 
about the conceptualization of source beliefs, as discussed above. Taken together, the mediation 
path indicated that espousing the belief that knowledge originates within oneself may be 
detrimental to critical thinking about complex and conflicting socio-scientific issues, via high 
levels of frustration. Indeed, frustration is an intense negative emotion that can overtake the 
cognitive system (Rosenberg, 1998), and is linked to a reduction of effortful thinking and an 
increase of rigid and shallow processing of information (see Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, 
& Perry, 2011; Pekrun & Stephens, 2012). Indeed, D’Mello and Graesser (2012) proposed that 
frustration can lead to boredom and ultimately, disengagement from task. This is consistent with 
findings from this study, where we observed a negative relationship between boredom and 
critical thinking.  
Moreover, we observed a significant positive relationship between anxiety and critical 
thinking, suggesting that anxiety may be beneficial for critical thinking. This result was expected 
and is consistent with Muis et al.’s (2015) results, who also noted a significant positive path from 
anxiety to critical thinking. In the present study, anxiety was unrelated to epistemic beliefs but 
may have been related to epistemic aims such as to understand the content or find the truth about 
genetically modified foods. Measuring epistemic aims as antecedents of epistemic emotions will 
be an important avenue to understand the conditions under which anxiety can benefit critical 
thinking, and those under which it does not.   

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
179 
In terms of positive emotions, in this study, we did not find significant predictive 
relationships between enjoyment and critical thinking, and curiosity was not included in 
mediational analyses due to issues of collinearity with confusion. Therefore, the current results 
do not replicate prior work by Muis et al. (2015) and Chevrier et al. (under review), who found 
curiosity to predict critical thinking in path analysis. Muis et al. (2018) proposed that curiosity 
and confusion are similar in that they both result from surprise triggered by dissonance, 
incongruity, or uncertainty. They proposed that the complexity of information or of a task 
predicts whether curiosity or confusion follows surprise. Specifically, they argued that when 
complexity is high, surprise may turn into confusion, whereas curiosity is more likely to ensue in 
cases where discrepancies can be easily revolved. In the current study, it appears that curiosity 
and confusion highly co-occurred. More research is needed to better understand how individuals 
experience curiosity and confusion when trying to determine what is true or what to believe 
about a complex and controversial topic.  
Recent qualitative work by Danvers (2015) may help understand why, in this study, 
critical thinking was predicted by negative emotions and not by positive ones: Danvers asked 15 
social science undergraduate students about what critical thinking feels like. Students’ responses 
revealed the experience of critical thinking as moments of affective intensity that does not 
always feel good. Students reported reactive bodily responses to critical thinking, rather than a 
purely cognitive experience. Participants mentioned that critical thinking felt troubling and could 
be troublesome, using words such as “fiery” and “abrupt.” Danvers’ (2015) findings may also 
shed light on the fact that boredom negatively predicted critical thinking. Indeed, boredom is 
predominantly characterized by low arousal that is described by those who experience it as 
lacking meaning and significance in what one is doing (Hubbard, 2019; Pekrun, Goetz, Daniels, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
180 
Stupnisky, & Perry, 2010), and is unlikely to be compatible with what has been described as the 
fiery and abrupt affective nature of critical thinking.  
Overall, the current study provided support for many of the predictions posited in the 
epistemic cognition and emotion literature, yet also provided new insights into the epistemic and 
affective nature of critical thinking. Specifically, the notion that more constructivist epistemic 
cognition promotes critical thinking was generally supported, as was the contention that 
epistemic emotions mediate relations between epistemic cognition and cognitive processes. 
Further, results supported the idea that milder forms of negative emotions such as anxiety and 
confusion can be beneficial for critical thinking, whereas intense activating negative emotions 
(i.e., activating forms of frustration) or deactivating emotions (i.e., boredom) are detrimental for 
critical thinking. However, results also challenged the assumptions that positive emotions are 
required for critical thinking to occur. Lastly, our results challenge dominant conceptions about 
beliefs in the self as the primary source of knowledge as being beneficial for critical thinking. 
Our counter-hypothetical results provide additional support for the idea that there is a need to 
reconsider and reinvestigate how individuals productively conceive of and justify knowledge 
(see Chinn et al., 2011; Greene et al., 2008; Greene & Yu, 2014). Overall, findings from the 
current study support the notion that critical thinking is not necessarily something that feels good 
(Danvers, 2015), yet suggest that espousing more constructivist beliefs about the nature of 
knowledge may benefit critical thinking by tampering certain difficult emotions and supporting 
the use of critical thinking.  
Educational Implications 
 
The results obtained in the present study have several implications for educational 
interventions aimed at increasing critical thinking about socio-scientific issues. First, findings 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
181 
support the notion that knowledge- and knowing-related issues should be highlighted and 
discussed in educational settings, with the aim of developing more constructivist forms of 
epistemic cognition. Notably, discussions surrounding the complex and tentative nature of 
scientific knowledge may be beneficial to shaping individuals’ expectations about the issues they 
will be called upon to reflect and act on during their lifetime. Ronald Barnett (2004), a prominent 
philosopher of higher education, has described the mission of university education as preparing 
students for a complex and uncertain future: For individuals to prosper, make decisions, and 
come to a position of security amid multiple interpretations, individuals must come not only to 
learn for uncertainty, but to learn to live with uncertainty. Barnett contends that no risk-free 
curricular approach can achieve this; instead, he calls for a curriculum that aims at educational 
transformation through exposure to dilemmas and uncertainties. This may include, for instance, 
confronting students with the limits of knowing in a field and with the limitations of the field as 
such. In addition to uncertainty- and complexity-focused curricula, Muis, Trevors, and Chevrier 
(2016) proposed that to achieve epistemic change, epistemic climates are needed that involve 
constructivist pedagogical approaches (e.g. inquiry-based learning, apprenticeship, collaborative 
learning, knowledge building, communities of practice), decentralized authority structures, open-
ended assessment practices, and appropriate levels of teacher support, as students experience the 
sometimes difficult process of belief change.  
 
Second, findings from the present study suggest that to develop critical thinking about 
socio-scientific issues, learning environments should be supportive of students’ emotional 
responses. In particular, for students with less constructivist epistemic cognition, being exposed 
to complex and conflicting information may trigger surprise, confusion, and frustration. We 
argue that such emotions should be welcomed without judgment by teachers and peers, and that 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
182 
these emotional experiences should be normalized. Further, teachers should discuss their own 
epistemic emotions and model appropriate emotion regulation strategies (Gross, 2014). Related 
to confusion, students may have a tendency to want to avoid confusion by seeking out tasks with 
minimal intellectual challenges (situation selection), seeking help when challenged (situation 
modification), or intentionally ignoring or misattributing the cause of discrepant events to avoid 
confusion (reappraisal; D’Mello & Graesser, 2014; Gross, 2014; Harley, Pekrun, Taxer, & 
Gross, in press). However, teachers can discuss the drawback of these strategies, and further 
suggest and model a different set of emotion regulation strategies, including choosing to engage 
in tasks that are intellectually challenging (situation selection), open up to perspectives that do 
not at first flatter their preferred position (situation modification), and help students build 
competencies for critical reflection (competence enhancement). By reinforcing the latter 
strategies, students may become what Clifford (1988) describes as “academic risk takers,” who 
are more tolerant to uncertainty and failure. 
 
Third and relatedly, given observed relations between complexity beliefs, confusion and 
critical thinking, as well as between source beliefs, frustration and critical thinking, we suggest 
that students with less constructivist epistemic beliefs on these two dimensions may benefit from 
learning materials that trigger mild confusion, but without giving way to frustration. To this end, 
D’Mello and Graesser (2012) suggest pedagogical practices where misconceptions are exposed, 
where complexity is embraced, and where less cohesive texts and lectures replace the polished 
deliveries of textbooks and formal lectures. However, to avoid confusion turning into frustration 
or disengagement (D’Mello & Graesser, 2012), teachers should support the development of 
students’ critical thinking skills and resolution strategies by scaffolding and modelling these 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
183 
abilities (Muis & Dufy, 2013), so that students become able to productively engage with 
confusion-inducing materials, to the benefit of deep and critical thinking. 
Limitations and Future Directions  
Several concerns may limit the results presented herein. First, the analysis used 
correlational associations of the study variables over time but did not experimentally manipulate 
the predictor variables. As such, future research should complement the approach used here with 
experimental studies. However, this may be easier to do with emotions, which can to some extent 
be manipulated experimentally, than with more stable epistemic beliefs. A second limitation 
concerns the rubric employed to capture critical thinking in essays. Specifically, we opted for a 
quantitative approach to coding critical thinking by attributing one point for the presence of each 
component of critical thinking. However, a weighted coding scheme or a holistic rubric are two 
other modes of critical thinking assessment that include qualitative elements of analysis that 
could have yielded different results. Therefore, future research is needed to replicate the findings 
presented here.  
The current findings have important implications for future research on epistemic 
cognition and epistemic emotions. Specifically, to fully understand how epistemic cognition 
supports critical thinking, future research should explore the role that other facets of epistemic 
cognition play in mediating this relationship. For instance, how do individuals’ knowledge of 
epistemic strategies shape critical thinking, and do these abilities predict the arousal of epistemic 
emotions in the face of complex and conflicting information? And how might epistemic aims 
moderate these relations? Prior work has shown that these other epistemic facets play a 
significant role in epistemic emotion arousal (see Chevrier et al., under review) and researchers 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
184 
have called for more research on epistemic cognition that conceptualize and operationalize the 
construct beyond the sole notion of epistemic beliefs (Greene et al., 2016; Muis et al., 2018).  
Lastly, in light of the findings revealed herein, we contend that one important avenue for 
future work will be to investigate how different intensities of positive, neutral, and negative 
epistemic emotions relate to information processing and critical thinking. To this end, we believe 
that the self-report measurement of emotions can be complemented by and triangulated with 
trace data collected by think-aloud or emote-aloud protocols (e.g., Chevrier et al., under review; 
Craig, D’Mello, Witherspoon, & Graesser, 2006), physiological measures of emotions such as 
analysis of facial expression, electrocardiograms, and galvanic skin responses (Azevedo et al., 
2013; D’Mello et al., 2014), and qualitative work. In sum, by broadening conceptual horizons 
and employing advanced methodologies, we believe that future research will provide a rich 
portrait of the ways in which epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions support critical 
thinking.

Example 
Taking a stance The writer 
takes a stance 
or identifies a 
position. 
I would say that I 
am for the 
development of 
genetically 
modified plants to 
help increase food 
production or 
nutrition. 
 The writer 
does not take a 
stance. The 
text is 
informative, 
not 
argumentative. 
There are certain 
problems in the 
discourse on 
genetically 
modified foods that 
are preventing the 
two sides from 
productively 
engaging one 
another. Those 
arguing in favor of 
GM foods assume 
that the other side 
doesn't understand 
what they are 
talking about, 
because 
modifications to 
genes occur in 
nature and in 
farming practices 
such as cross-
pollination. 
However, 
opponents of GM 
foods are 
generally talking 
only about a 
certain subset of 
genetic 
modification 
practices. This is a 
problem in 
defining the terms 
of the debate.

Presenting 
supportive 
arguments 
The writer 
supports 
his/her 
position with 
valid 
arguments, 
evidence, or 
reasons. 
Genetically 
modifying food is 
a necessary 
practice but it 
comes at a cost. 
Worldwide 
starvation can be 
combatted using 
GMFs. Rice 
which is the main 
staple of starving 
countries can be 
re-engineered to 
have the 
necessary 
nutrients to 
prevent 
malnutrition. 
More crops can 
also be 
genetically 
modified to 
survive in rough 
climates. 
Herbicide 
tolerance is 
another reason 
GMFs in 
necessary. 
 No arguments 
or evidence are 
presented to 
support their 
position, or the 
arguments are 
invalid. 
I often hear about 
news on the 
dangers of GM 
and how it might 
be increasing 
cancer rates or 
how it is slowly 
taking over the 
food market and 
poisoning us. 
However, I just 
realized how little 
knowledge I have 
about GM and that 
it is not entirely a 
bad thing. I think 
the reaction to GM 
food is mostly 
coming from lack 
of information. 
Acknowledging 
an alternative 
perspective 
The writer 
acknowledges 
an alternative 
perspective 
and engages 
with that 
perspective by 
identifying 
valid 
arguments in 
support of that 
perspective. 
GM crops are 
more resistant to 
pests, tolerant of 
herbicides 
(reducing 
environmental 
damage), tolerant 
of drought-ridden 
and high-salinity 
environments, and 
beneficial to the 
nutrition of 
impoverished 
populations who 
rely on a single 
crop for 
sustenance. That

being said, there 
are many 
downsides to GM 
foods. GM foods 
have received 
great criticism

while 
governments face 
criticism for not 
enforcing enough 
oversight. 
food, the overall 
demand for food 
can be met with a 
proportionally 
lower level of 
output. So 
cumulatively, GM 
foods provide a 
means of 
producing more 
food that is more 
effective, thereby 
offering a solution 
to the predicted 
increase in the 
world's total 
demand for food. 
Evaluating 
claims 
The writer 
explains why 
a claim may 
be credible or 
not credible, 
reliable or 
unreliable, 
limited or 
generalizable, 
convincing or 
not 
convincing, 
etc. 
The study on the 
intestines on rats 
fed with GM 
potatoes could 
mean that there 
might be negative 
effects on humans. 
However, based 
on the text, it is 
inconclusive. The 
differences in 
intestines could 
even be helpful 
for humans. 
 The writer 
expediently 
accepts or 
dismisses a 
claim without 
evaluating it – 
without 
providing a 
reason or 
explanation as 
to why it 
should be 
accepted or 
rejected. 
[…] The anti GM 
seem to rely on 
fear, paranoia and 
overall unsound 
arguments to 
argue their cause, 
and do not accept 
the undeniable 
positives of GM 
crops. Of the 4 
arguments listed 
by the anti-GM 
side, all of them 
seem to be 
unfounded fears, 
or studies seem to 
be cherry-picked 
to fit their point of 
view.

Experimental Text 
Version A (Pro-Con):  
What Are Genetically Modified Foods? 
 
Have you ever wondered what it means when you hear the term “genetically modified 
foods?” Have you ever thought about how genetically modified foods are developed? Each of 
those questions are quite interesting to think about given that some of the foods we eat may have 
been genetically modified. In answer to the first question, genetically modified foods are those 
that have been modified via genetic engineering or other more traditional methods in order to 
produce heritable improvements in plants or animals for specific uses (US Department of 
Agriculture, 2011). In other words, they are foods that have been modified at the gene level to 
produce a desired trait that would most likely not occur through natural processes. So, just what 
processes are involved in genetically modifying foods?  
You may think that genetically modifying foods is the same process as cloning. This 
belief is not correct. Cloning involves making an exact genetic copy of an organism. All of the 
genetic information is identical between those two organisms. In contrast, the process of 
genetically modifying food can be done using gene cloning methods; however, the protein in the 
genetically modified organism has been modified somewhat so that the host (modified) organism 
will express the desired trait. Thus, the genetically modified organism is not usually an exact 
replica of the donor organism. 
You may think that injecting hormones into a plant or animal is involved in the 
production of genetically modified foods. This belief is also incorrect. Injecting hormones into a 
plant or animal can increase its growth rate or its size. However, injecting hormones does not 
modify the genetic makeup of the plant or animal. In contrast, genetically modified foods have 
had some of their characteristics changed at the gene level.  
 
Now you know that genetically modified foods are those foods that have had some of 
their genetic information changed. You may think that the development of genetically modified 
foods occurs only in laboratories by scientists. This is also not correct! Genetic modifications 
may happen through natural processes. For example, one type of a natural process for genetic 
modification of plants is cross-pollination. Cross-pollination occurs when the pollen from one 
plant is crossed with the pollen of a second plant. Corn plants are often cross-pollinated when 
wind carries pollen from one corn crop to a separate corn crop in nearby fields. When corn plants 
of different varieties are cross-pollinated, the seeds they produce will be genetically different 
than the original corn plants. The corn produced by these cross-pollinated plants is a combination 
of the two varieties of corn. The corn seeds from the new cross-pollinated plant will carry the 
new genetic information. That new genetic information will continue to be a part of that plant’s 
offspring. 
Since it is the case that genetically modified foods can occur through natural processes 
you may wonder just how long genetic modification of foods has been taking place. You may 
hold the belief that genetically modified foods are only a product of contemporary scientific 
research. This belief is not correct! Indeed, for many centuries farmers and gardeners have used 
cross-pollination of plants in an attempt to produce plants or flowers that would have particular 
qualities. For example, farmers have used selective pollination of plants in hopes of producing 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
211 
sweeter fruits or more colorful flowers. Even today, farmers and gardeners use cross-pollination 
in hopes of producing plants with more desirable traits. 
In summary, genetically modified foods are those foods that have had some of their 
genetic information changed. Some foods can be genetically modified through natural processes 
such as cross-pollination. Farmers have used the process of genetically modifying foods for 
centuries as they attempt to develop plants with desired characteristics.  
 
What are some of the advantages of GM foods?2  
 
The world population has topped 7 billion people and is predicted to double in the next 50 years. 
Ensuring an adequate food supply for this booming population is going to be a major challenge 
in the years to come. GM foods promise to meet this need in a number of ways: 
 
1) Pest resistance Crop losses from insect pests can be staggering, resulting in 
devastating financial loss for farmers and starvation in developing countries. Farmers 
typically use many tons of chemical pesticides annually. Consumers do not wish to 
eat food that has been treated with pesticides because of potential health hazards, and 
run-off of agricultural wastes from excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers can 
poison the water supply and cause harm to the environment. Growing GM foods such 
as B.t. corn can help eliminate the application of chemical pesticides and reduce the 
cost of bringing a crop to market. 
 
2) Herbicide tolerance For some crops, it is not cost-effective to remove weeds by 
physical means such as tilling, so farmers will often spray large quantities of different 
herbicides (weed-killer) to destroy weeds, a time-consuming and expensive process, 
that requires care so that the herbicide doesn't harm the crop plant or the environment. 
Crop plants genetically-engineered to be resistant to one very powerful herbicide 
could help prevent environmental damage by reducing the amount of herbicides 
needed.  
 
3) Drought tolerance/salinity tolerance As the world population grows and more land 
is utilized for housing instead of food production, farmers will need to grow crops in 
locations previously unsuited for plant cultivation. Creating plants that can withstand 
long periods of drought or high salt content in soil and groundwater will help people 
to grow crops in formerly inhospitable places. 
 
4) Nutrition Malnutrition is common in Third World countries where impoverished 
peoples rely on a single crop such as rice for the main staple of their diet. However, 
rice does not contain adequate amounts of all necessary nutrients to prevent 
malnutrition. If rice could be genetically engineered to contain additional vitamins 
and minerals, nutrient deficiencies could be alleviated.

What are some of the criticisms against GM foods?  
 
Environmental activists, religious organizations, public interest groups, professional associations 
and other scientists and government officials have all raised concerns about GM foods, and 
criticized agribusiness for pursuing profit without concern for potential hazards, and the 
government for failing to exercise adequate regulatory oversight. Here are some concerns: 
 
1) Unintended harm to other organisms In 2013, a laboratory study was published in 
Nature showing that pollen from B.t. corn caused high mortality rates in monarch 
butterfly caterpillars. Monarch caterpillars consume milkweed plants, not corn, but 
the fear is that if pollen from B.t. corn is blown by the wind onto milkweed plants in 
neighboring fields, the caterpillars could eat the pollen and perish. Unfortunately, B.t. 
toxins kill many species of insect larvae indiscriminately; it is not possible to design a 
B.t. toxin that would only kill crop-damaging pests and remain harmless to all other 
insects.  
 
2) Reduced effectiveness of pesticides Just as some populations of mosquitoes 
developed resistance to the now-banned pesticide DDT7uy, many people are 
concerned that insects will become resistant to B.t. or other crops that have been 
genetically modified to produce their own pesticides. 
 
3) Gene transfer to non-target species Another concern is that crop plants engineered 
for herbicide tolerance and weeds will cross-breed, resulting in the transfer of the 
herbicide resistance genes from the crops into the weeds. These "superweeds" would 
then be herbicide tolerant as well. Other introduced genes may cross over into non-
modified crops planted next to GM crops.  
 
4) Unknown effects on human health There is a growing concern that introducing 
foreign genes into food plants may have an unexpected and negative impact on 
human health. A recent article published in Lancet examined the effects of GM 
potatoes on the digestive tract in rats. This study claimed that there were appreciable 
differences in the intestines of rats fed GM potatoes and rats fed unmodified potatoes.

peoples rely on a single crop such as rice for the main staple of their diet. However, 
rice does not contain adequate amounts of all necessary nutrients to prevent 
malnutrition. If rice could be genetically engineered to contain additional vitamins 
and minerals, nutrient deficiencies could be alleviated.

Final Discussion 
 
 
 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
221 
Epistemic cognition, defined as the ways in which individuals acquire, justify, and use 
knowledge, is necessary to successfully navigate complex informational landscapes in the 21st 
century. A growing body of research demonstrates that differences in epistemic cognition predict 
a variety of academic processes and outcomes, including academic achievement (Barzilai & 
Zohar, 2014; Buehl & Alexander, 2005; Greene, Muis, & Pieschl, 2010; Hofer, 2000; 
Schommer, Crouse & Rhodes, 1992), self-regulated learning (Muis, 2007, 2008), digital literacy 
(Kammerer, Amann, & Gerjets, 2015), and motivation (Muis, 2004). Recent research on 
epistemic cognition has shed light on the multiple epistemic structures through which individuals 
perceive and apprehend knowledge (Bromme, Pieschl, & Stahl, 2010; Chinn, Buckland, & 
Samarapungavan, 2011; Greene, Azevedo, & Torney-Purta, 2008; Muis, Bendixen, & Haerle, 
2006; Muis, 2007), and has generated novel and integrated frameworks (Barzilai & Zohar, 2014; 
Bråten, Britt, Strømsø & Rouet, 2011; Chinn, Rinehart & Buckland, 2014; Muis, Chevrier, & 
Singh, 2018).  
However, despite evidence that epistemic cognition “matters” (Kuhn, 1999), a recent 
meta-analysis has shown that the relationship between epistemic cognition and academic 
achievement is surprisingly small (r = .162, p < .001; Greene, Cartiff, & Duke, 2018). A few 
reasons may explain this. As discussed in Chapter 2, a narrow focus on epistemic beliefs, as 
opposed to other structures such as epistemic aims or epistemic strategies, may have limited 
researchers’ perceptions of the epistemic processes actually at play in learning contexts. 
Additionally, concerns about the psychometric adequacy of frequently used measures of 
epistemic cognition (i.e., self-report instruments) may have prevented researchers from reliably 
measuring what they believed to be measuring, making relations between epistemic cognition 
and outcome variables disputable. Further, as argued by Bråten and colleagues (2011), much 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
222 
more research is needed to understand the mediational mechanisms by which epistemic cognition 
predicts learning. Lastly, it may be the case that epistemic cognition has a greater effect on 
educational outcomes such as digital literacy or critical thinking than on achievement per se. 
The purpose of this dissertation was to address these gaps by proposing a multi-study 
investigation into the role of epistemic emotions as a promising mediator in the relation between 
epistemic cognition and important educational outcomes, namely self-regulated learning and 
critical thinking. By adopting new conceptualizations and using advanced methodological and 
analytical approaches to match these conceptualizations, I have addressed several of the issues 
that have limited previous research in epistemic cognition. Therefore, the conclusions drawn in 
this dissertation add new insights into the nature and role of epistemic emotions in epistemic 
cognition, specifically as it concerns the antecedents and consequences of epistemic emotions.  
Contributions of the Present Dissertation 
 
This dissertation makes several contributions of theoretical importance. First, on the basis 
of a comprehensive literature review, I identified key facets of epistemic cognition and 
articulated integrated definitions that establish clear conceptual distinctions, notably between 
epistemic beliefs and epistemic cognition, as well as between epistemic cognition and critical 
thinking. In both cases, definitions and distinctions have been unclear or inconsistent, resulting in 
calls from leading scholars for increased conceptual clarity in empirical research (see Bråten, 
2016; Greene, Sandoval & Bråten, 2016). Further, we have empirically examined these relations, 
thereby providing support for the notion that the degree to which epistemic beliefs are considered 
constructivist relates to the extent to which individuals perceive and address issues of knowledge 
(Chapter 3, Study 1), as well as for the notion that epistemic cognition is an important 
underpinning to critical thinking (Chapter 4).  

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
223 
Second and importantly, in this dissertation, we have provided evidence for the mediating 
role of epistemic emotions in the relation between epistemic cognition and important educational 
outcomes. We have extended and bolstered Muis and colleagues’ (Muis et al., 2015; Muis, 
Chevrier, & Singh, 2018) integrated framework of epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions 
by testing the model in three ways: In Chapter 3, we tested how epistemic emotions relate to 
learning strategies in a short time span (Study 1), as well as over the course of an entire learning 
session (Study 2). Further, we have tested the generalizability of the model by testing the role of 
epistemic emotions as a mediator in the relationship between epistemic cognition and two 
important educational outcomes: learning achievement (Chapter 3, Study 2) and critical thinking 
(Chapter 4). In doing so, the research presented in Chapter 4 attests to the importance of studying 
how epistemic cognition relates to other epistemically-related processes such as problem-
solving, and decision-making, in a variety of contexts, including non-academic ones.  
Third, the research presented in this dissertation contributes to extending Pekrun’s 
control-value theory of academic emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun & Perry, 2014) by advancing 
knowledge on one type of academic emotion, i.e., epistemic emotions. Specifically, we 
empirically tested three new types of cognitive appraisals that serve as antecedents to emotions 
in educational settings (i.e., appraisals of epistemic congruence, appraisals of information 
novelty and complexity, appraisals of epistemic aim achievement). 
This dissertation also makes contributions of methodological importance. First, the data 
collection methods employed in Chapter 3 presented one way to operationalize distinctions 
between epistemic beliefs and online epistemic cognition. Second, in Chapter 3, we presented a 
novel analytical approach to examine the immediate consequences of emotions on learning 
processes (see also D’Mello & Graesser, 2012). Lastly, in Chapter 4, we developed a coding 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
224 
scheme to capture critical thinking about socio-scientific issues that can be used to inform future 
empirical work as well as instructional interventions to increase critical thinking of controversial 
socio-scientific issues. 
Similarly, from the perspective of improving learning and critical thinking around socio-
scientific issues of personal and global relevance, the conclusions reached in this dissertation 
indicate several paths for the design of effective interventions around epistemic cognition and 
epistemic emotions. These include teaching students to embrace uncertainty and complexity, and 
to accept and learn to regulate the unpleasant but beneficial emotions that may accompany this 
endeavor. In the following section, I address the potential limitations of this dissertation and then 
discuss directions for future work in this area.  
Limitations of the Present Dissertation 
 
The conclusions drawn from this dissertation may be limited in several ways. First, the 
experimental conditions used in the studies presented here differ in many ways from the 
naturalistic conditions in which individuals typically engage in learning and thinking about 
socio-scientific issues, which include, for instance, web searching and open-ended discussions 
with people of similar or opposing perspectives. Instead, in the studies presented in Chapter 3 
and Chapter 4, participants had access only to a fixed number of written documents on an 
imposed topic and had to complete tasks they may have lacked personal significance. Given that 
epistemic cognition and critical thinking are two higher-order processes that require motivated 
and effortful thinking, one could question the extent to which participants were motivated to 
deploy their best epistemic cognition and critical thinking. Indeed, Hyytinen, Holma, Toom, 
Shavelson, and Lindblom-Ylänne (2014) found that under experimental conditions, students’ 
motivation to think critically did not match their actual critical thinking skills. Similarly, 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
225 
knowing that participants did not have access to further sources of information other than the 
documents provided to them during the experiment might have prevented some individuals from 
questioning the trustworthiness of the sources provided or conversely, cause them to accept 
claims at face value. This may have decreased the quantity and quality of epistemic cognition 
and critical thinking observed in these studies. Similarly, given that task value and perceived 
control are important antecedents to emotions in academic settings (Pekrun, 2006), it may be the 
case that low task value could have impacted the arousal of epistemic emotions in these 
experimental settings, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings. As such, future work 
examining relations between epistemic cognition, emotions and also critical thinking should 
consider more naturalistic settings, such as open-ended Internet searches or group discussions. 
Other limitations concern the measurement of constructs and analytical approaches 
employed in this dissertation. Specifically, only quantitative measurements of epistemic 
cognition, epistemic emotions, self-regulated learning, and critical thinking were taken. For 
epistemic emotions, prior theoretical and empirical work, as well as several findings from this 
dissertation, indicate that several epistemic emotions, whether positive or negative in valence 
(e.g., surprise, confusion, anxiety), can be beneficial or detrimental to learning and thinking, 
depending on their level of intensity, and possibly also on their chronometry (i.e., how long an 
emotion lasts before it fades away). Indeed, by nature, emotions are highly fluid and ephemeral, 
and can last only a passing moment or linger for several minutes or hours, and this is a variable 
that matters. Indeed, lasting emotions may morph into different emotional states that can have 
important consequences for learning and thinking, such as when lasting confusion turns into 
frustration or disengagement (D'Mello & Graesser, 2012). In the work presented here, we did not 
take measurement of emotions’ chronometry, but this will be crucial for future work to advance 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
226 
theories of academic emotions in general, and of epistemic emotions in particular. To this end, 
advanced methods such as physiological measures of facial expression, physical activation, heart 
rate or skin conductivity may be considered. 
Lastly, the analyses presented in this dissertation used correlational associations of 
variables, and we did not manipulate predictor variables. To this end, mood induction protocols 
(for a review, see Quigley, Lindquist, & Barrett, 2014) can be used to elicit and assess emotions. 
However, this may be more difficult to achieve for more stable epistemic beliefs.  
Future Directions 
 
Several avenues for future work have already been delineated in the discussion of the 
limitations presented above. However, there are two additional areas in need of future research 
that warrant a fuller discussion. The first pertains to underexplored contexts and the second 
concerns the study of relations between epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions across the 
lifespan.  
 
Underexplored contexts. There are several ways in which individuals engage in learning 
and thinking about socio-scientific issues: one way is by consulting documentation, such as in 
this dissertation; other ways include dyadic or group discussions, or participation in relevant 
communities of practice where knowledge is generated and shared. To date, little is known about 
how epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions may arise and relate to learning in thinking in 
these alternative contexts. Specifically, which additional psychological or social processes may 
act as antecedents to epistemic emotions in these contexts? And how might group dynamics 
mediate or moderate the consequences of epistemic emotions on relevant outcomes?   
 
Looking beyond the context of socio-scientific issues, underexplored contexts relevant to 
this line of research include disciplines or topics that are based on an epistemology that is 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
227 
different from the epistemology of science, such as history, economics, literature, or creative or 
artistic work, inside and outside of educational settings. What epistemic emotions arise when 
learning or thinking about the conflicting issues that populate these contexts? How are these 
emotions related to facets of epistemic cognition? And what role do epistemic emotions play in 
these contexts? Relatedly, how are epistemic emotions experienced and expressed across socio-
cultural contexts? In educational settings, socio-cultural elements such as the nature of feedback, 
the meaning of assessment outcomes, peer support structures, or task complexity, can 
significantly affect perceived control and task value (Pekrun, 2006), and may modulate the 
arousal, intensity, and chronometry of epistemic emotions. In turn, these variations may 
potentially affect the consequences of epistemic emotions for learning and thinking.  
Relations between epistemic cognition and epistemic emotions across the lifespan. 
To fully understand the role of epistemic emotions in epistemic cognition, future research will be 
necessary to assess how current understandings generalize to different populations across the 
lifespan, from children to adolescents to experts. Prior work has shown that the way in which 
negative emotions relate to learning processes and outcomes is different for children than for 
adults, possibly because children have not yet developed emotion regulation to the same extent 
as adults (e.g., Muis, Psaradellis, Di Leo, Lajoie, & Chevrier, 2015). Further, among the adult 
population, differences have been established with regard to the ways in which novice and 
experts perceive, use, and justify knowledge (Greene & Yu, 2014) that may impact the arousal 
and consequences of epistemic emotions in various learning contexts. Further, differences in  
epistemic cognition development and emotional experiences may affect several educational 
processes and outcomes in ways unknown to date. Muis et al. (2006) proposed that the 
development of epistemic cognition is shaped by experiences in the family and social 

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
228 
environments, then later in educational settings. However, little is known about how epistemic 
emotions (for instance, confusion, curiosity, or joy of learning), whether experienced or 
modelled, shape the development of epistemic cognition. Reciprocally, might the development of 
epistemic cognition shape epistemic emotional experiences in educational settings later in life?  
At later points in life, what role may epistemic emotions play in educational 
perseverance, the attainment of higher education degrees, or professional success? With specific 
concern for doctoral education and academic careers, what role may epistemic emotions play in 
degree completion, academic success, and well-being, as opposed to burnout or attrition? Indeed, 
the study of epistemic emotions as one facet of epistemic cognition is rife with research 
questions that remain to be explored and that could reveal new perspectives on instructional 
interventions designed to increase learning and thinking about complex issues and beyond. 
Concluding Comments 
 
In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, it is becoming more important than ever 
for individuals to be proficient in how to vet, acquire, use, and justify knowledge in the face of 
complex and conflicting issues. Understanding how individuals think and feel when contending 
with socio-scientific issues of personal and global importance is an important line of research 
that requires integrated conceptualizations and sophisticated methodologies. My objectives for 
the present dissertation were to review theoretical assumptions about the structures of epistemic 
cognition, identify methodological approaches that are aligned with these conceptualizations, and 
use contextualized data to investigate the emotional facet of epistemic cognition, its antecedents 
and consequences for important educational outcomes, including self-regulated learning and 
critical thinking. In addressing these issues, I hope to have contributed to a more complete 
understanding of epistemic cognition and its relations to learning and thinking about socio-

EPISTEMIC COGNITION AND EPISTEMIC EMOTIONS 
 
229 
scientific issues, and also to have broadened the horizons of future research by including 
epistemic emotions in the conversation.
