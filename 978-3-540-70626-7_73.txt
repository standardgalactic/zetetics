Robert Karplus and Norman Kroll ﬁrst attempted this type of calculation using
Feynman’s diagrams soon after learning the new techniques from Dyson [2]. Eight
years later, several other physicists found a few algebraic errors in the calculation,
whose correction only affected the ﬁfth decimal place of the original answer. Since
the 1980s, Tom Kinoshita of Cornell University has gone all the way to diagrams
containing eight vertices – a calculation involving 891 distinct Feynman diagrams,
accurate to ten decimal places [3].
Although Feynman diagrams were developed as a tool for calculating the effects
of weakly-interacting forces (such as electromagnetism), the diagrams were quickly
adapted during the 1950s and 1960s to treat all kinds of other interactions, from
the strong nuclear force, to many-body interactions in condensed-matter physics, to
gravitation, and beyond [5]. They have become a ubiquitous element of the physi-
cist’s toolkit.

Fine-Structure Constant
Helge Kragh
The ﬁne-structure constant is a dimensionless constant of nature, given by α =
e2/ℏc, in electrostatic cgs units, where e is the elementary charge, ℏ Planck’s
constant (=h/2π), and c the velocity of light. The number is a measure of the

strength of electromagnetic interactions. The numerical value of α is known with
great accuracy:
α−1 = 137.035 · 999 · 76 ± 0.000 · 000 · 50
The name “ﬁne-structure constant” relates to  spectroscopy, but even before
it was revealed in spectra it was realized that the ratio e2/ℏc might be of theoret-
ical signiﬁcance. In 1905 Max Planck pointed out that e2 and ℏc have the same
dimensions and the same order of magnitude. However, if α was ever “discov-
ered” the honour must go to Arnold Sommerfeld, who in 1915–16 extended Niels
Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom ( Bohr’s atomic model) to the domain of spe-
cial relativity. He derived the energy levels in the relativistic case and found that
the Hα line would appear as a doublet with a “ﬁne-structure separation” given by
α. Measurements made by Friedrich Paschen conﬁrmed the theory and resulted in
α−1=137.9.
With the emergence of quantum mechanics in 1925–26, it turned out that α
was intimately connected with the electron’s  spin, a relationship fully explained
by Paul A.M. Dirac’s relativistic wave equation of 1928 ( Dirac equation and
 relativistic quantum mechanics). Inspired by Dirac’s theory, Arthur S. Eddington
suggested that α was a fundamental quantity connected also to cosmological quan-
tities such as the number of particles in the universe. Moreover, he believed that the
numerical value of α could be derived a priori, and that the result must be an in-
teger: α−1=137. Although experiments disagreed with Eddington’s claim, and his
theory was generally rejected, it led to many attempts to relate α to pure numbers
or other constants of nature. This kind of “alpharology” was particularly popular in
the 1930s and has continued until the present. Although numerology `a la Eddington
has today a low reputation, some physicists still believe that it should be possible to
calculate the value of α purely deductively. So far, all attempts have failed.
Because α can be determined from the spectra of distant luminating objects, such
as quasars, it is possible to check if the quantity has varied over cosmological time.
Speculations of a time-varying α go back to the 1930s and in 2001 measurements
from absorption lines in quasars indicated that α might have been smaller in the past.
However, more recent and accurate data suggest that the ﬁne-structure constant is
indeed constant: it had the same value billions of years ago as it has today.
