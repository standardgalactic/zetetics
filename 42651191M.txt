Locking the buttons
Slide the ������������������������������
HOLD switch in the direction 
of the arrow in the recording or playback 
mode. When the HOLD function is 
activated, the yellow marking appears 
beside the switch.
*
“HOLD” will flash, indicating that all the 
functions of the buttons are locked.
Unlocking the buttons
Slide the HOLD switch in the opposite 
direction from that of the arrow so that all 
buttons will be unlocked.
Note
When the HOLD function is activated during 
recording, all the functions of the buttons are 
locked to prevent accidental operation. To stop 
recording, cancel the HOLD function first.
Tip
Even if the HOLD function is activated, you 
can stop the alarm playback by pressing any 
button. (You cannot stop normal playback.)
Step 2: Preparing a 
Power Source
Slide and lift the battery compartment lid, 
insert LR03 (size AAA) alkaline batteries 
with correct polarity, and close the lid.
If the battery compartment lid is 
accidentally detached, attach it as 
illustrated.
Tips
Messages recorded or alarm settings are not 
erased even when you replace the batteries.
When replacing the batteries, the clock 
continues moving for a certain period of 
time after you remove the batteries.
Even if you do not use the IC recorder, 
the batteries are consumed slightly. The 
battery life in this case varies depending 
on humidity or other environmental 
conditions. Usually, the batteries last about 
2 months. If you do not intend to use the IC 
recorder for an extended period of time, it is 
recommended that you turn the power off or 
remove the batteries.
Notes
Do not use manganese batteries for this IC 
recorder.
When replacing the batteries, be sure to 
replace both batteries with new ones.
When to replace the batteries
The battery indicator in the display window 
shows the battery condition.
Battery remain indication
: Replace the current batteries with 
new ones.
  
: “LO BATT” flashes and the IC 
recorder will stop operation.
Step 3: Turning the IC 
Recorder On
Slide the HOLD switch in the opposite 
direction from that of the arrow. The IC 
recorder turns on, and “ACCESS” flashes.
To turn the power off
When you are not using the IC recorder, 
you can prevent the batteries from getting 
weak quickly by turning the power off.
Slide the ���������������������������������
HOLD switch in the direction of 
the arrow in the stop mode. “OFF” flashes. 
The IC recorder turns off within a few 
seconds.
Tips
When you are not going to use the IC 
recorder for a long time, we recommend to 
turn off the IC recorder.
When 10 minutes have passed after you 
have turned on the IC recorder and leave it 
without doing anything, the display goes off 
automatically. (Press any button to show the 
display.)
Step 4: Setting the 
Clock
Remove the protective film on the display 
window before you use the IC recorder.
You need to set the clock to use the alarm 
function or record the date and time.
Clock setting display appears when you 
insert batteries for the first time, or when 
you insert batteries after the IC recorder 
has been without batteries for a certain 
period of time, the year section flashes in 
the display window.

level (AVLS)
The AVLS (Automatic Volume Limiter 
System) function allows you to listen to the 
sound at a moderate volume level when 
using headphones (not supplied). The 
AVLS function limits the maximum volume 
to prevent auditory issues or distraction 
and to maintain a moderate volume level.
When the “AVLS” is set to “ON” in the 
menu, and you try to adjust the volume to a 
level that exceeds the AVLS-specified level, 
“AVLS” indicator lights. You cannot adjust 
the volume to a level that exceeds the limit.

that  exceeds the AVLS-specified level for 
specified period of time, “AVLS” and “ON” 
will be displayed and the “AVLS” in the 
menu is automatically set to “ON.”
 Notes
When using the built-in speaker or

Additional Information
Precautions
On power
Operate the unit only on 3.0 V or 2.4 V DC. 
Use two LR03 (size AAA) alkaline batteries 
or two NH-AAA rechargeable batteries.
On safety
Do not operate the unit while driving, 
cycling or operating any motorized vehicle.
On handling
Do not leave the unit in a location near 
heat sources, or in a place subject to direct 
sunlight, excessive dust or mechanical 
shock.
Should any solid object or liquid fall into 
the unit, remove the batteries and have 
the unit checked by qualified personnel 
before operating it any further.
Be careful not to allow water to splash 
on the unit. The unit is not water-proof. 
In particular, be careful in the following 
situations.
When you have the unit in your pocket 
and go to the bathroom, etc.
When you bend down, the unit may 
drop into the water and may get wet.
When you use the unit in an 
environment where the unit is exposed 
to rain, snow, or humidity.
In circumstances where you get sweaty.
If you touch the unit with wet hands 
or if you put the unit in the pocket of 
sweaty clothes, the unit may get wet.
You may feel pain in your ears if you 
use the headphones when the ambient 
air is very dry. This is not because of 
a malfunction of the headphones, but 
because of static electricity accumulated 
in your body. You can reduce static 
electricity by wearing non-synthetic 
clothes that prevent the emergence of 
static electricity.
