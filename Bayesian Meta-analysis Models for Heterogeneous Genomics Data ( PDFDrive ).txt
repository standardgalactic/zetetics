Abstract
The accumulation of high-throughput data from vast sources has drawn a lot atten-
tions to develop methods for extracting meaningful information out of the massive
data. More interesting questions arise from how to combine the disparate informa-
tion, which goes beyond modeling sparsity and dimension reduction. This disserta-
tion focuses on the innovations in the area of heterogeneous data integration.
Chapter 1 contextualizes this dissertation by introducing diﬀerent aspects of
meta-analysis and model frameworks for high-dimensional genomic data.
Chapter 2 introduces a novel technique, joint Bayesian sparse factor analysis
model, to vertically integrate multi-dimensional genomic data from diﬀerent plat-
forms.
Chapter 3 extends the above model to a nonparametric Bayes formula. It directly
infers number of factors from a model-based approach.
On the other hand, chapter 4 deals with horizontal integration of diverse gene
expression data; the model infers pathway activities across various experimental
conditions.
All the methods mentioned above are demonstrated in both simulation studies
and real data applications in chapters 2-4.
Finally, chapter 5 summarizes the dissertation and discusses future directions.

Introduction
Most cellular activities can be organized as interacting regulatory modules: sets
of genes with a common function co-regulated in response to internal and external
stimuli (Segal et al., 2003). Examples include metabolic pathways and cell cycle gene
modules (Moreno-Asso et al., 2013). Genes in the same module are coordinately
activated or repressed under the same regulatory mechanism. This can be captured
by genome-wide gene expression proﬁling. Microarray is a powerful tool to measure
the expression level of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously, thus helps to capture
gene regulatory patterns (a.k.a., co-expression patterns) for numerous individuals of
various disease states. There have already been several publications on identiﬁcation
of gene expression signatures related to cancer speciﬁc phenotypes (Gui and Li, 2005;
Garber et al., 2001) and cellular physiology of S. cerevisiae (Airoldi et al., 2009).
However, several challenges are not addressed using gene expression data alone:
i) How do genetic mutations (e.g., copy number variations and single nucleotide
sequence changes) or epigenetic alterations (e.g., methylation and histone modiﬁ-
cations) disrupt the regulatory network and manifest in disease, such as cancer?
Fundamentally, this question is to inquire into the basic mechanism of cancer that
1

persistently drives tumor proliferation and metastasis, even though each individual
tumor is highly heterogeneous.
ii) How to decipher the biological function responsible for the diﬀerential expres-
sion pattern of a regulatory module associated with a particular experimental trait?
Meanwhile, how to obtain a systematic understanding of the module function among
diﬀerent cellular parts, genetic backgrounds, and environments (e.g., nutrients, radi-
ation and cell micro-environments)?
A recent ﬂood of genome-wide data generated by high-throughput technologies
provides unprecedented opportunity to tackle the above problems (Pe’er and Haco-
hen, 2011). Therefore, there is a critical need for powerful statistical approaches that
build models from diverse data types in a ’data integration’ fashion. This chapter
will provide more details regarding the above three aspects. It will mainly concen-
trate on using gene expression as an intermediary to build a cascade of events from
DNA, to seek the root cause of cancer, and to connect genomic information from
diverse biological conditions through modulated gene expression to phenotype.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 1.1 will elaborate
on biological motivations for the three problems; In section 1.2, solutions to these
questions will be provided with an overview of statistical models developed in this
dissertation.
1.1
Biological motivation
1.1.1
Discovering driver mutations in cancer
Cancer is caused through a multistep process, in which a succession of genetic and epi-
genetic changes collectively inﬂuence the expression of multiple genes, leading to the
alteration of key pathways and biological processes underlying malignant behaviors.
Speciﬁcally, copy number variations (CNVs) change the dosage of key tumor-inducing
and tumor-suppressing genes, thereby aﬀecting mRNA transcription and neoplastic
2

cell proliferation.
On the other hand, the mechanism of epigenetic alterations is
more complicated. For example, DNA methylation patterns are globally disrupted
in tumor cells. The cancer methylome is characterized by both global hypomethy-
lation and region-speciﬁc hypermethylation at CpG islands. Hypomethylation may
contribute to carcinogenesis via transcriptional activation of tumor-promoting genes
(Wu et al., 2005), while hypermethylation at CpG islands is associated with si-
lencing genes involved in growth regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis and tumor
suppression.
It is even noted that hypermethylation is more likely prominent in
transcriptional silencing and down-regulating pathways involved in drug resistance
(chemoresistance) (Li et al., 2009). Therefore, genetic mutations and chromosomal
aberrations are the central characteristics of tumor cells (Pe’er and Hacohen, 2011).
In recent years, the emergence of large-scale copy number assays and methyla-
tion platforms enables the possibility of tracing phenotypic diﬀerences back to their
genetic/epigenetic source. However, only a few genetic mutations or epigenetic al-
terations provide a persistent ﬁtness advantage across multiple tumors. Such a rare
event could leave a ’genomic footprint’ in the form of a gene expression signature
(Akavia et al., 2010). Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to distinguish
genetic/epigenetic changes that alter mRNA transcription, and thus promote can-
cer progression (driver mutation) from those with no selective advantage (passenger
mutation) (Pe’er and Hacohen, 2011; Akavia et al., 2010).
We propose to integrate gene expression data of cancer patients with their multi-
perspective genomic information by the development of two innovative statistical
models (brieﬂy overviewed in section 1.2.1) in chapters 2 and 3. Such a global analysis
of genomic eﬀects on the co-expression modules can have transformative value, which
allows biologists to conduct reﬁned experiments, decipher the underlying mechanism,
and identify combinatory therapeutics for controlling cancer.

1.1.2
Pathway analysis via a compendium of expression proﬁles
The co-expression modules derived from gene expression proﬁles provide a good way
to understand molecular mechanisms underlying cellular changes at a functional level.
With the establishment of large knowledge bases, such as Gene Ontology, KEGG and
BioCarta, it becomes straightforward to understand the cause of changes in gene
expression.
The general workﬂow is ﬁrst to identify dysregulated pathways/gene
sets that diﬀerentiate test from normal groups, such as disease subjects vs. healthy
individuals, then to generate hypothesis that links the biological characteristic of the
pathway/gene set to the experimental perturbation.
Over the past few decades, large compendia of gene expression data have been
freely deposited in the public repositories, representing transcriptional responses to
a vast number of perturbations including mutants, treatment with pharmaceutical
compounds, etc. By comparing the expression proﬁle caused by an uncharacterized
perturbation to a large and diverse set of reference proﬁles, one can hypothesize
the function of an uncharacterized module by borrowing information from known
modules corresponding to other disturbances. Such an approach has great advan-
tages over a conventional single assay, as it integrates measurements from each single
cellular parameter to form a systematic landscape.
In chapter 4, we develop a statistical method (overviewed in section 1.2.1.) to
integrate multiple gene expression experiments to infer pathway activities across
diverse biological conditions. This method is useful to generate novel hypotheses
about the causes and consequences of speciﬁc expression patterns associated with a
particular phenotypic trait (Gower et al., 2011).

Statistical innovation
In order to fully decipher the biological knowledge contained in the tremendous
amount of ’Omics’ data, an essential approach is to combine multiple studies for
meta-analysis. I adopt this term for the purpose of research synergy: identifying het-
erogeneity and homogeneity across multi-platforms and diverse gene expression pro-
ﬁles, developing biomarkers from training data sets and making predictions against
the testing groups. For the ﬁrst problem in 1.1.1, I deﬁne the combination of multiple
sources of ’Omics’ information from a given cohort of patients as vertical integration.
Mathematically, the problem can also be viewed as stacking several matrices ver-
tically, each representing a data set with same number of samples in columns, but
diﬀerent quantities of genes in rows. In the second scenario (1.1.2), I deﬁne combining
gene expression proﬁles from diverse range of experiments as horizontal integration.
Again, mathematically, this is equivalent to placing individual matrices parallel to
each other to form a bigger dataset, where each one shares the same number of rows
but has a diﬀerent number of columns.
1.2.1
Integrative modeling with joint factor analysis approach
The initial chapters of this dissertation concentrate on integrative modeling. Genome-
wide data is high dimensional and contains correlated information such as co-expression
modules. One of the fundamental goals of genomic data analysis is to determine if the
data arose from a mixture of several distinct populations. However, in high dimen-
sion, visually inspecting the diﬀerence between subpopulations is nearly impossible
(Smith, 2005). Therefore, techniques, including factor analysis (FA), are developed
to reduce the high dimensional data to much lower dimensions. The FA model has
5

the following expression:
X = ΛF + ϵ =
K
X
k=1
ΛkFk + ϵ
(1.1)
where X represents the genomic data with dimension p × 1 and n samples, n ≪
p; Λ = [Λ1, Λ2, . . . , ΛK] ∈Rp×K is the factor loading matrix with K ≪p, and
F = [F1, F2, . . . , FK]T ∈RK×n is the factor score matrix. ϵ is the noise term and
has a diagonal precision matrix, diag(φ).
In a conventional FA model, in order
to identify the correlation among genes, sparse constraints are further imposed by
zeroing out many variables on the loading matrix, thus greatly reducing the number
of parameters. This is necessary to perform robust inference on high-dimensional
data (Karoui, 2008). Secondly, a standard normal prior is imposed on F to alleviate
issues with identiﬁability of F and Λ due to scaling. Therefore, the marginal density
function of X becomes N(X; 0, ΛΛT + diag(φ)). It is clear that by modeling the
sparseness and low-rank structure in the covariance matrix of data through Λ, we
can identify true signals in high dimensional genomic data.
Using this framework, each high-dimensional genomic dataset, e.g., gene expres-
sion, CNV or methylation, can be analyzed with an individual FA model. We take
a step further by assuming some factors are shared by two or more datasets that ex-
plains the statistical correlations among them. Chapter 2 introduces this approach
by developing a two-FA model using two datasets as an example, aneuploidy and gene
expression. We link individual factors from each dataset by sampling gene expression
factors under a multivariate normal distribution centered on the CNV factors. This
way allows us to impose the hypothesis that gene expression is directly aﬀected by
CNVs. It addresses the question of dimensionality discrepancy between two data
modalities, and prevents the diﬀerence in data size from overwhelming the infor-
mation available on associations between them. Meanwhile, there are fractions in
6

gene expression that cannot be explained by copy number variations, or the changes
in CNVs do not necessarily result in expression dysregulation. In this sense, the
model is ﬂexible enough to incorporate unique factors speciﬁc to each data modality
by imposing a diﬀuse standard normal prior on these factors. Additionally, each FA
model has a unique factor loading matrix to account for the mapping between factors
and observations. Sparseness is further imposed on factor loadings with a ’spike and
slab’ prior (Ishwaran and Rao, 2005). This chapter provides a general framework for
vertically integrating multi-platform genomic data. By treating gene expression as a
downstream event, it could decipher regulation mechanisms from diﬀerent sources,
such as epigenetic modiﬁcations (e.g., methylations) or post-transcriptional regula-
tors (e.g., microRNAs).
The above model requires pre-speciﬁcation of factor numbers by applying aﬃnity
propagation to one of the data sets. However, it is very challenging to check model
assumptions in high dimensions. Besides, the common and unique factors need to
be predeﬁned as well. Without enforcing any constraints, factor labels suﬀer from
arbitrary permutation.
It becomes a long-standing label-switching problem (ﬁrst
proposed by Diebolt and Robert (1994)) that there is no unique answer for labeling
the shared/unique factors.
To address this, non- or semi-parametric models are needed. Chapter 3 extends
the joint FA model to a nonparametric Bayesian formula. Based on the same as-
sumption of factorizing the latent space into shared and data-speciﬁc components,
the new model employs a beta-Bernoulli process (Griﬃths and Ghahramani, 2005;
Thibaux and Jordan, 2007; Paisley and Carin, 2009) to infer the dimensions of these
latent spaces. Therefore, the factor matrix becomes the Hadamard product of both
factor scores and a sparse binary matrix drawn from the beta-Bernoulli process. The
latter also enables the possibility of discovering factors that are relevant to only a
subset of the subjects. This is very useful in cancer research, since cancer is highly
7

heterogeneous even among patients with the same tumor subtype. The same reg-
ulatory mechanism cannot explain all variability among individuals. By doing so,
we could assign zeros to a subset of row vectors in the factors, thus ﬁltering out
patients whose expression alterations are weakly related to their genetic/epigenetic
mutations. A vertical integration of three diﬀerent datasets, including gene expres-
sion, CNV and methylation from TCGA ovarian cancer patients, are explored with
this model, followed by discussion of novel hypotheses.
Another complementary direction of meta-analysis is to horizontally integrate
diverse genomic data, such as gene expression microarrays. By borrowing informa-
tion from each data set, representing a diﬀerent experimental perturbation, we are
interested in identifying consistent co-expression patterns across diverse biological
conditions. Chapter 4 provides a novel statistical solution to this question based on
the FA framework (1.1). We improve the model interpretability by correlating each
gene in the microarray to a known pathway. Therefore, the sparseness becomes well
deﬁned by introducing a strongly informative prior on the loading matrix. Inspired
by the application of a beta-Bernoulli process to uncover patient heterogeneity in
chapter 3, we adopt a similar strategy to model the pathway-dataset membership
using a three-layer beta-Bernoulli hierarchical distribution. In this way, the method
can identify pathways speciﬁc to a particular experimental trait or consistently dif-
ferentially expressed under a variety of interventions. Application of this model to
a radiation study reveals novel insights into the molecular basis of time- and dose-
dependent response to ionizing radiation in mice peripheral blood. It provides a
broadly applicable approach to generate biological hypotheses in a gene expression
data-driven and pathway-centric manner.

Summary of contributions
Through this dissertation, biological and methodological aspects of the high-dimensional
meta-analysis problems are discussed along with the development of several innova-
tive statistical models. Core contributions of each chapter are highlighted as follows:
chapter 2 introduces a novel statistical model, joint Bayesian factor analysis model,
which vertically integrates multi-platform genomic data to uncover key mutations in
cancer. Chapter 3 discusses an extension of this model to a nonparametric Bayesian
formula. Application to analyzing multi-dimensional genomic data for ovarian cancer
is also included. Using a similar joint factor analysis framework, chapter 4, however,
talks about a horizontal integration approach for pathway analysis using diverse gene
expression data. The successful application to a mice radiation study demonstrates
the utility of this approach. Finally in chapter 5, I conclude this work with the
discussion of some extended questions and follow-up goals.

Joint Bayesian Factor Analysis–A Vertical
Integration Approach to Model Multi-platform
Genomics Data
2.1
Introduction
Human cancers are heterogeneous due to combined eﬀects of genetic instability and
selection, where the accumulation of the most advantageous set of genetic aberra-
tions results in the expansion of cancer cells (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005). There
are many diﬀerent types of instability that occur during tumor development, such
as point mutation, alteration of microsatellite sequences, chromosome rearrange-
ments, DNA dosage aberrations and epigenetic changes such as methylation. These
abnormalities acting alone or in combination alter the expression levels of mRNA
molecules. However, the genetic history of tumor progression is diﬃcult to decipher.
Because it is only a suﬃciently protumorigenic aberration or obligate products of a
crucial alteration that results in tumor development (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005).
Genomic DNA copy number variations (CNVs), kilobase- or megabase-sized du-
plications and deletions, are frequent in solid tumors. It has been shown that CNVs
10

are useful diagnostic markers for cancer prediction and prognosis (Kiechle et al.,
2001; Lockwood et al., 2005). Therefore, studying the genomic causes and their as-
sociation with phenotypic alterations is emergent in cancer biology. The underlying
mechanism of CNV related genomic instability amongst tumors includes defects in
maintenance/manipulation of genome stability, telomere erosion, chromosome break-
age, cell cycle defects and failures in DNA repairs (Albertson, 2003). Consequential
copy number aberrations of the above mentioned malfunctions will further change
the dosage of key tumor-inducing and tumor-suppressing genes, which thereby af-
fect DNA replication, DNA damage/repair, mitosis, centrosome, telomere, mRNA
transcription and proliferation of neoplastic cells. In addition, microenvironmental
stresses play a role in exerting strong selective pressure on cancer cells with ampliﬁca-
tion/deletion of particular regions of the chromosome (Lucas et al., 2010). Recently,
high-throughput technologies have mapped genome-wide DNA copy number varia-
tions at high resolution, and discovered multiple new genes in cancer. However, there
is enormous diversity in each individual’s tumor, which harbors only a few driver mu-
tations (copy number alterations playing a critical role in tumor development). In
addition, CNV regions are particularly large containing many genes, most of which
are indistinguishable from the passenger mutations (copy number segments aﬀect-
ing widespread chromosomal instability in many advanced human tumors) (Akavia
et al., 2010). Thus analysis based on CNV data alone will leave the functional impor-
tance and physiological impact of genetic alteration ineluctable on the tumor. Gene
expression has been readily available for proﬁling many tumors, therefore, how to
incorporate it with CNV data to identify key drivers becomes an important problem
to uncover cancer mechanism.
This chapter is laid out as follows: Section 2.2 covers a variety of CNV data top-
ics, starting with a range of diﬀerent CNV measurement techniques, which includes
a brief discussion of the data format. Practical examples are used to show collecting,
11

generating and assessing data, plus several ways to manipulate data for normaliza-
tion. In the end, diﬀerent computational approaches are introduced for analyzing
CNV data. Section 2.3 focuses on a novel algorithm for integrating CNV with mRNA
expression data, which can be potentially extended to incorporate multiple genomic
data. Basic concepts of Bayesian factor analysis are brieﬂy mentioned. Case studies
then provide detailed description for this particular approach. Section 2.4 provides
a brief wrap-up of the main ideas in the chapter. It illustrates the advantage of our
statistical models on studying cancer genomics, and discusses the signiﬁcance of the
approach for clinical application.
2.2
Copy number analysis
2.2.1
Copy number analyses techniques
Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) is a recently developed technology and
proﬁles genome-wide DNA copy number variations at high resolution. It has been
popular for molecular classiﬁcation of diﬀerent tumor types, diagnosis of tumor pro-
gression, and identiﬁcation of potential therapeutic targets (J¨onsson et al., 2010;
McKay et al., 2011). The use of CGH array oﬀers many advantages over traditional
karyotype or FISH (ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization). It can detect microduplica-
tions/deletions throughout the genome in a single experiment. A review of diﬀerent
CGH array techniques is provided as follows:
•BAC Array
The CGH array using BAC (bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome) clones has been
widely used. The spotted genomic sequences are inserted BACs: two DNA samples
from either subject tissue (target sample) or control tissue (reference sample) are
labeled with diﬀerent ﬂuorescent dyes–for example, with the test labeled in green
and reference in red. The mixture is hybridized to a CGH array slide containing
hundreds or thousands of deﬁned DNA probes. The probes targeting regions of the
12

chromosome that are ampliﬁed turn predominantly green. Conversely, if a region is
deleted in the test sample, the corresponding probes become red. However, given
the resolution limitation on the order of 1Mb and array size of 2.4K to ∼30K unique
elements, the BAC array data is relatively low density.
•cDNA/oligonucleotide Array
cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays are designed to detect complementary DNA
’targets’ derived from experiments or clinics. It allows greater ﬂexibility to produce
customized arrays, and reduces the cost for each study.
But the shorter probes
spotted on these new arrays are less robust than large segmented BACs, because they
contain a large number of genes that are not of interest to the researchers. However,
they do provide higher resolution in the order of 50-100kb, where oligonucleotide
array is a particular case.
•Tiling Array
Tiling arrays are available now for ﬁner resolution of speciﬁc CNV regions. These
arrays are designed to cover the entire genome or contiguous regions within the
genome. The number of elements on the array ranges from 10K to over 6M. This
relatively high resolution technique allows the detection of micro-ampliﬁcations and
deletions.
•SNP Array
SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) arrays are a high-density oligonucleotide-
based array that can be used to identify both loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and
CNVs. LOH is the loss of one allele of a gene, which can lead to functional loss of
normal tumor suppressor genes, particularly if the other copy of the gene is inactive.
LOH is quite common in malignancies. Therefore, utilization of SNP arrays to detect
LOH provides great potential for cancer diagnosis.
•Array CGH
Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH, or aCGH) is a high-
13

resolution technique for genome-wide DNA copy number variation proﬁling. This
method allows identiﬁcation of recurrent chromosome changes with microampliﬁca-
tions and deletions, and detects copy number variations on the order of 5-10kb DNA
sequences. In the rest of this chapter, we will use the CNV data generated from the
Agilent Human Genome CGH microarray 244A.
2.2.2
Array CGH data
The CNV data is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. TCGA
is a joint eﬀort of the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI) to understand genomic alterations in human cancer.
It aims to study the molecular mechanisms of cancer in order to improve diagnosis,
treatment and prevention. Since the importance of DNA copy number variations has
been demonstrated in many tumors, TCGA performs high-resolution CNV proﬁling
in a large-scale study, using diverse tumor tissues and across diﬀerent institutes. In
this section, we will show an example from the TCGA project.
Sample collection
Biospecimens were collected from newly diagnosed patients with ovarian serous
cystadenocarcinoma (histologically consistent with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma
conﬁrmed by pathologists), who had not received any prior treatment, including
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Technical details about sample collection and qual-
ity control are described in (TCGA, 2011). Raw copy number data was generated at
two centers, Brigham and Women’s Hospital of Harvard Medical School and Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, using the Agilent Human Genome Comparative Genome
Hybridization 244A platform.
14

Data process
After the array CGH is constructed and tumor DNA samples hybridized to the
platform, several steps need to be completed for detecting regions of copy number
gains or losses: image scanning, image analysis (including gridding, spot recognition,
segmentation and quantiﬁcation, and low-intensiﬁed feature removal or mark), back-
ground noise subtraction, spot intensity ratio determination, log-transformation of
ratios, signal normalization and quality control on the measured values. For Agilent
244K array, there are speciﬁc details on the data generation (TCGA, 2008). First of
all, the raw signal is obtained by scanning images using Agilent Feature Extraction
Software (v9.5.11), followed by image analysis procedures mentioned above.
Background correction: The background corrected intensity ratios for both chan-
nels are calculated by subtraction of median background signal values (median pixel
intensities in the predeﬁned background area surrounding the spot) of each chan-
nel from the median signal values (median pixel intensities computed over the spot
area) of each probe in the corresponding channel. Since there are multiple copies of
probes on an array, the ﬁnal background corrected values are computed by taking the
median across the duplicated probes. The log2 ratios of the above results are then
estimated based on the background corrected values of sample channel over that of
the reference channel.
Normalization of logarithmic ratio: The normalization procedure involves the
application of LOWESS (locally weighted regression and scatterplot smoothing) al-
gorithm on log2 ratio data. This method assumes that the majority of probe log2
ratios do not change, and are independent of background corrected intensities of the
probes. To develop the LOWESS model, a 21-probe window is applied for smoothing
process after sorting the chromosome positions. It corrects the log2 ratio data so that
the corresponding central tendency after normalization lies along zeros, assuming an
15

equal number of up- and down- regulated features in any given intensity range. In
addition, the artifact of the diﬀerence in the probe GC content on log2 ratios is con-
sidered for correction, in which case, the probe GC%, regional GC % (GC% of 20KB
of genome sequence containing the probe sequence) and log2 ratio are used in the
LOWESS model.
Quality control: There are several criterions taken into account for quality assur-
ance at various stages. 1) Probes that are ﬂagged (marking spots of poor quality and
low intensity) or saturated by the Agilent feature extraction software are eliminated;
2) Screening of the array image is conducted to exclude probes whose median sig-
nal values are lower than that of the background intensity; 3) Arrays with over 5%
probes ﬂagged out or being faint are considered as low quality; 4) The square root
of the mean sum squares of variance in log2 ratio data between consecutive probes
are calculated for quality assessment. Arrays with the value over 0.3 are considered
as low quality.
The ﬁnal result after these processes forms a data set containing 227614 probes
with normalized log2 ratio values for every sample. The logarithmic ratios are com-
puted as log2(x) −log2(2), where x is the copy number inferred by the chip. Thus,
ratios should be 0 for double loss, 1
2 for a single loss, 1 for the normal situation, 3
2 for
a single gain, and n
2 for n copies. TCGA provides an Array Design Format ﬁle with
annotation data, including information on chromosomal location and gene symbol
for each probe.
Algorithms for CNVs detection
The main biomedical question for studying CNVs and downstream research is to
accurately identify genomic/chromosomal regions that show signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation
or deletion in DNA copy number.
Satisfactorily solving this problem requires a
method that reﬂects the underlying biology and key features of the technological
16

platform. The array CGH data has particular characteristics: The status of DNA
copy number remains stable in the contiguous loci, and the copy number of a probe
is a good predictor for that of the neighboring ones, whereas for probes located far
apart, it provides less information to predict the likely state of its neighboring probes
(Rueda and Uriarte, 2007). However, widely used array CGH platforms, such as
cDNA/oligonucleotide arrays, do not have equally spaced probes, making them less
informative based on consecutive probes. Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of disease
causal genes sometimes requires examining the amplitude of CNVs, especially when
high-resolution technologies are available, it can be valuable to distinguish between
moderate copy number gains and large copy number ampliﬁcation.
A number of well-known methods have been developed to carry out automatic
identiﬁcation of copy number gains/loss, and correlate that with diseases. These
approaches are designed to estimate the signiﬁcance level and location of CNVs.
Models diﬀer in distribution assumption and incorporation of penalty terms for pa-
rameter estimation. Subsequently, smoothing algorithms were derived for denoising
and estimating the spatial dependence, such as wavelets (Hsu et al., 2005) and lowess
methods (Beheshti et al., 2003; Cleveland, 1979). Later on, a binary segmentation
approach, called circular binary segmentation (CBS) (Olshen et al., 2004), was pro-
posed that allows segments in the aCGH data in each chromosome, and computes
the within-segment means. CBS recursively estimates the maximum likelihood ratio
statistics to detect the narrowed segment aberrations. A more complicated likeli-
hood function was used with weights chosen in a completely data adaptive fashion
(Adaptive weights smoothing procedure, AWS) (Hup et al., 2004). A diﬀerent kind
of modeling approach involves the hidden Markov model (HMM ) (Fridlyand et al.,
2004), which assigns hidden states with certain transition probabilities to underlying
copy numbers. Thus, it adequately takes advantage of the physical dependence in-
formation of the nearby fragments. However, questions arise on how to appropriately
17

select the number of hidden states. The sticky hidden Markov model with a Dirich-
let distribution (sticky DD-HMM) (Du et al., 2010) was then developed to infer the
number of states from data, while also imposing state persistence. Alternatively,
the reversible jump aCGH (RJaCGH) (Rueda and Uriarte, 2007) was introduced to
ﬁt the model with varying number of hidden states, and allow for transdimensional
moves between these models. It also incorporates interprobe distance.
2.3
Joint analysis of copy number variation and gene expression
2.3.1
Overview
With the increasing availability of concurrently generating multiple diﬀerent types
of high throughput data on single samples, there is a lot of interest to jointly analyze
this information and reﬁne the generation of relevant biological hypotheses. This
will lead to a greater, more integrated understanding of cellular mechanism, and will
allow the identiﬁcation of genomic regulators as well as suggest potentially synergistic
drug targets for those regulators, which will lead to potential combination therapies
for the treatment of human cancer. A number of approaches have demonstrated
an ability to select speciﬁc genes from joint analysis and test speciﬁc hypotheses
regarding the regulation of cellular responses, which is a tremendous advantage over
the pathway analyses that can be obtained from gene expression or CNVs alone.
Recently, there are publications that highlight the impact of combining other
types of DNA modiﬁcation and gene expression. Parsons et al. (2008) have identi-
ﬁed a number of potential driver mutations in Glioblastoma through an analysis of
mutation, copy number variation and gene expression. Their approach is designed
around the use of currently available methods for the analysis of individual data
types to create a compressed set of features which are then used independently in
predictive models. They utilize tree models, however the compressed features are
independent variables that can, in principle, be used in any type of predictive model.
18

The approach does make use of correlation within each type of data, but not across
diﬀerent data types.
A similar approach to the integration of disparate types of data is outlined in
(Lanckriet et al., 2004), but in this case features are compressed through the use of
kernel functions. These must be predeﬁned for each data type, but once that is done
all of the diﬀerent data types are mapped to the same vector space allowing joint
analysis. The approach is particularly suited to the use of support vector machines,
rather than tree models, for the generation of models from all of the diﬀerent data
types. The approach is remarkably general in that almost any type of data may be
incorporated, and in the paper they include compelling examples of the integration of
expression and protein sequence data. It, however, does suﬀer from the same ﬂaws as
Parsons et al. (2008) in that there is no provision for dealing with correlation across
data types.
Another approach to integrative analysis is through the use of data from diﬀerent
assays to ﬁlter lists of genes sequentially. Garraway et al. (2005) describe such an
approach, in the context of the identiﬁcation of MITF as a genomic determinant in
malignant melanoma. The algorithm ﬁrst identiﬁes genomic regions that show copy
number variation in the condition of interest, and then searches for genes that are
signiﬁcantly over or under expressed in samples that have duplications or deletions in
that region. This is a very powerful approach in cases where there are few genes that
pass the ﬁltering criteria and where the relationship between gene expression and
CNV is direct. Through our own experimentation, we ﬁnd that there are often many
genes that pass both ﬁltering criteria. Additionally, the approach is dependent on
the order in which the data types are used to perform the ﬁltering. This is because
the ﬁltering criterion on the second data set is determined by the behavior observed
on the ﬁrst.
The version of integrative genomic analysis that is most similar to our own pro-
19

posal is CONEXIC, detailed in Akavia et al. (2010). CONEXIC is based on gene
modules, which was initially developed for the analysis of gene expression data in
isolation. Gene modules consist of groups of genes that are coexpressed, and these
are embedded as leaves in a binary tree structure where the nodes are populated by
putative gene expression regulators. In its original incarnation, the approach was
intended to identify important regulators of groups of genes in the context of ex-
perimental interventions. As such, expression is assumed to be constant within any
particular experimental group. Also, the original approach depends on a list of puta-
tive regulators, which can be tricky to generate. With CONEXIC, the identiﬁcation
of lists of potential regulators is generated from regions of the genome that demon-
strate consistent copy number variation, and the gene module algorithm is largely
retained. Fundamental to a binary tree model is the assumption that the expression
pattern of a leaf, conditional on the expression pattern of its parent node, is inde-
pendent of all other elements in the tree. This is a shortcoming of the CONEXIC
approach. It is quite reasonable to expect that there are many ways that a cell is able
to control the expression of a particular gene, including CNV, methylation, inacti-
vation of promoters, and RNA interference. Multiple diﬀerent regulators may have
combined eﬀect to ultimately regulate gene expression. Because each node of the
tree contains only one putative regulator, the model assumes that only one regulator
is responsible for the observed expression pattern of a module.
2.3.2
Bayesian factor analysis
Bayesian factor analysis is a dimension reduction method to decompose variability
among observations into a lower number of unobserved, uncorrelated factors. It has
been widely applied in microarray analysis (Carvalho et al., 2008b; Lucas et al.,
2009), where the data usually comes with a much higher dimension than the number
of observed samples. Therefore, it is desirable to select important genes that should
20

bear some biological meanings. Recent developments in Bayesian multivariate mod-
eling has enabled the utility of sparsity induced structure in genomic studies (Lucas
et al., 2006). Such a sparse factor model implies that only those genes with non-zero
loadings on those factors are relevant, and higher values indicate more signiﬁcant
gene-factor relationship.
2.3.3
Sparse regression model of Bayesian factor analysis
Our statistical framework utilizes high-dimensional sparse factor model, and is ex-
tended to incorporate gene expression, CNVs and other high-throughput genomic
data. The underlying hypothesis is that the gene signatures of expression variation
can be represented by the estimated factors. Furthermore, given the potential con-
tribution of chromosomal aneuploidy and CNVs to the altered mRNA expression
of relevant genes during oncogenesis, we could use the factor model to test for the
association between gene expression signatures and CNVs. The model assumes that
the input data are from the same patient cohort. Suppose the data structure is given
as X = [x1, . . . , xn] with dimension n × px, where n denotes the sample size, px the
number of genes, and xi the ﬂuorescence level from probes of gene expression mea-
surements. The CNV data is represented by Y = [y1, . . . , yn] with similar strucutre.
Therefore, the linear regression model for sample i can be expressed as
xi = Bhhi + BFi + ϵi
(2.1)
yi = Ahhi + AGi + ζi
(2.2)
with the following components:
• B is the px × k factor loadings matrix for sample xi, with elements βg,j for
g = 1, . . . , px and j = 1, . . . , k.
• Fi = [f C
i ; f (r)
i ]T. fi is a k-dimension vector of factor scores, where f (r)
i , the r-th
factor for sample i, are speciﬁc to data xi, and f C
i
consists of the factors common
between both data.
21

• Bh is the px × r regression matrix for dataset xi, with elements bg,j for g =
1, . . . , px and j = 1, . . . , r.
• hi = [h1,i, . . . , hq,i]T is the q design factors of sample i.
• ϵi = [ϵ1,i, . . . , ϵpx,i]T is the idiosyncratic noise vector with dimension px.
The priors for each parameters are deﬁned as follows:
βg,j ∼(1 −ρj)δ0(βg,j) + ρjN(βg,j; 0, τj)
(2.3)
ρj ∼Beta(ρj; s0, l0); τj ∼Gamma(τj
−1; aτ
2 , bτ
2 )
(2.4)
bg,j ∼(1 −πj)δ0(bg,j) + πjN(bg,j; µ0,j, σ0
2)
(2.5)
πj ∼Beta(πj; t0, v0)
(2.6)
f (r)
i
∼N(f (r)
i ; 0, I)
f C
i ∼N(f C
i ; gC
i , Σ)
(2.7)
ϵ(r)
i
∼N(ϵ(r)
i ; 0, Φ); Φ = diag(φ1, . . . , φpx); φg ∼Gamma(φg; aφx
2 , bφx
2 )
(2.8)
The parameters and prior structures are similar for copy number data yi.
Prior Choices
• βg,j: The regression coeﬃcient. Here we consider the long-standing problem of vari-
able selection in a multivariate linear regression model. That is, in gene expression
analysis the number of gene features is huge (usually larger than 20,000) compared
with the number of samples available. A direct way is to use regression model on
the high-dimensional genomic data and impose sparseness on the coeﬃcients. In this
way, most of the coeﬃcients will be shrunk towards zero. Bayesian spike and slab ap-
proaches (Mitchell and Beauchamp, 1988; George and McCulloch, 1993; B¨uhlmann
and Hothorn, 2005) have been proposed to address the variable selection problem.
As indicated in 2.3, it sets up a two-component mixture distribution with the spike
part centered at zero and the slab part distributed diﬀusely without informed prior

• ρj: This parameter controls the prior probability of a coeﬃcient being non-zero.
We assume coeﬃcients that are promising have posterior latent variables ˆρj = 1 (the
slab). The opposite occurs when ˆρj = 0 with a delta function δ0(·) indicating the
point-mass at zero (the spike). Here we use beta priors, deﬁning the probability
ρj distributed on the interval (0,1). The hyperparameters s0 and l0 determine the
domain of the beta distribution. Small values of ρj reﬂect high prior skepticism about
the coeﬃcients, while large ρj means the knowledge of more theoretical importance
of the variables and more skeptical about the sampling of the data.
• τj: the variance for the slab part of the mixture prior for βg,j. This gamma distri-
bution is the conjugate prior for the precision of the normal distribution N(βg,j; 0, τj).
In addition, it allows the Markov chain to identify and adjust the appropriate sample
space for updating coeﬃcients. Diﬀerent combinations of ρj and τj prior choices are
usually required to obtain desirable mixing and shrinkage in βg,j.
• fi: Unknown latent factors for sample i.
For factors unique for each data,
we use a diﬀuse, conjugate prior distribution such that fj,i ∼N(0, 1), in order to
alleviate issues with identiﬁability of fi and β due to scaling. On the other hand,
since high-throughput data can vary in size by orders of magnitude, e.g. CGH data
is approximately ten times larger than gene expression.
Thus one data set may
dominate the factor model given a large size discrepancy. Therefore, rather than
utilizing the uninformative prior, we link individual factors from each data using
f C
i
∼N(gC
i , Σ) based on the hypothesis that gene expression is directly inﬂuenced
by CNVs. This will prevent diﬀerence in data size from overwhelming the information
available on associations between them. In addition, the systematic error between
two data sets will be considered by estimation of the covariance matrix Σ.

Example: joint analysis of ovarian cancer gene expression and CNVs
We applied our joint factor model on ovarian cancer gene expression and CNV data
from the TCGA project. This study is aimed to detect correlations between them,
25

which will lead to the identiﬁcation of pivotal genomic determinants of cancer phe-
notypes. We used data from 74 ovarian cancer individuals and 1 disease-free patient.
In order to capture genes with diﬀerential expression patterns and their association
with the CNVs in the narrowed chromosomal regions, we established a ﬁltering cri-
teria: 1) select Aﬀymetrix HT HG-U133A probes with sample mean above 8, and
standard deviation above 0.6; take out probes without matched gene symbols. It
results in a gene expression data set downsized from 22277 to 921 probes; A more
relaxed thresholding will generate a larger dataset, and we will discuss about it in
chapter 3.
2) apply the basic Bayesian factor model 2.1, i.e., the one that only
analyzes one data set, and generate signature expression factors; 3) remove CNV
segments (Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A probes) not showing signiﬁcant cor-
relation (p-value < 0.01 after Bonferroni correction) with the gene expression factors.
It reduced the CNV data dimension from 227613 to 7278. Therefore, we ﬁtted our
joint factor model 2.1 and 2.2 to the shrunk data.
We obtained 11 factors in the two data sets, i.e., F11∗75 and G11∗75, and selected
the most strongly associated pair using Pearson correlation. It turns out that the
largest factor loadings in the corresponding CNV factor come mostly from the long
arm of chromosome 8 (ﬁgure 1A), that the factor correlates well with the paired gene
expression factor (ﬁgure 1B), and that the gene expression factor correlates with
individual SNP observations in the long arm of chromosome 8 (ﬁgure 1C). Based on
these results, we further examined the genes loaded on this correlated CGH factor
and gene expression factor.
By ranking the squared factor loadings, we selected
the top 16 Aﬀymetrix probe sets (Table 3.1) and 178 CGH probe sets, because the
variance in these probes are best explained by the corresponding factors compared
with all other data. Pearson correlations between the values of mRNA expression
levels and copy number variations were calculated on these heavily loaded genes. We
noted that the copy number gains of EBAG9 (CGH probe position: 8q23.2, size 60
26

bp; mean copy number 2.63 (1-6)) and MTDH (CGH probe position: 8q22.1, size 60
bp; mean copy number 2.38 (1-6)) signiﬁcantly accompanies their overexpression of
mRNAs in the corresponding regions, where correlation coeﬃcients indicate a good
linearity between CNVs and gene expression with r = 0.758 for EBAG9 and r =
0.806 for MTDH. Interestingly, in the same factor, 3 CGH loci with duplicated DNAs
show signiﬁcant correlation with MTDH overexpression (r>0.8, p-val<0.01) and are
located 0.2M upstream, 5M and 12M downstream of MTDH CGH locus, respectively;
and 11 CGH loci are identiﬁed with copy number gain and 3Mb upstream of EBAG9
CGH clone (r>0.75, p-val<0.01). These ﬁndings may provide evidence for distant
regulatory of transcription elements or interactions within a potential gene network.
The product of EBAG9 has been identiﬁed as an estrogen receptor binding site
associated antigen 9 identical to RCAS1 (Nakashima et al., 1999). Overexpression of
EBAG9/RCAS1 inhibits growth of tumor-stimulated host immune cells and induces
their apoptosis (Nakashima et al., 1999). Furthermore, it has been reported that
RCAS1 is expressed with high frequency in ovarian and lung cancers (Akahira et al.,
2004; Iwasaki et al., 2000), and the copy numbers of the region increase in breast
cancer (Rennstam et al., 2003). These lines of evidence, together with the results
obtained above, imply that overexpression of EBAG9 in ovarian serous cystadenocar-
cinoma may be triggered by increased gene copy number, which is likely to play an
important role in the immune escape of tumor cells and causing cancer progression.
In addition, MTDH, also known as AEG1, is an oncogene cooperating with Ha-
ras as well as functioning as a downstream target gene of Ha-ras and may perform
a central role in Ha-ras-mediated carcinogenesis (Lee et al., 2007). Overexpression
of this gene has been reported in various cancers including breast, brain, prostate,
melanoma and glioblastoma multiforme (Emdad et al., 2007; Kikuno et al., 2007).
In particular, it has been revealed that MTDH overexpression is associated with
8q22 chromosomal gain in breast cancer, and has been considered as an important
27

therapeutic target for enhancing chemotherapy eﬃcacy and reducing metastasis risk
(Hu et al., 2009). Therefore, we believe that, our results along with the above ﬁndings
suggest the copy number gain activated MTDH overexpression is a potential indicator
in epithelial ovarian cancer.
Validations on the above hypotheses regarding critical genes in cancer progression
and their regulation mechanisms can be carried out in several directions. A num-
ber of databases can be used to validate these hypotheses. For instance, GATHER
and GOrilla are good resources to annotate gene functions; Tumorscape helps in-
terpret copy number variations; DAVID Bioinformatics provides pathway analysis
for genes identiﬁed by the model. In addition, experimental validation can be per-
formed to quantitatively justify that the activation/inactivation of identiﬁed genes
are caused by copy number variations. Moreover, we could identify drug susceptibil-
ities of these candidates by searching against reference information from DrugBank
(http://www.drugbank.ca), then using these results for experimental validation. The
general approach is to grow cell lines in the presence of a particular treatment, whose
genomic drivers are disrupted by the introduction of RNA inference and transfection
with viral plasmids. A similar strategy can also been applied to predict potential
therapies by the identiﬁcation of new drug targets. Therefore, these will lead to a
greater understanding of cancer progression, and allow the identiﬁcation of combined
therapies for individual tumors.
Tumor segmental aneuploidy association with gene expression factors has been
demonstrated in a previous study (Lucas et al., 2010) that it makes signiﬁcant con-
tributions to variation in gene signature of breast cancer under the stress of lactic
acidosis or hypoxia. We are interested to test if this is consistent in other tumor
tissues, which will provide potential treatment choices for diﬀerent cancers. We used
a similar approach (Lucas et al., 2010) by projecting the breast expression factors
into TCGA ovarian and glioblastoma gene expression data and identiﬁed correlated
28

CNVs under the same interventions of lactic acidosis/hypoxia. The ability of pro-
jecting the factor model into other data sets allows the possibility of comparing new
experimental data to diﬀerent genomic information, such as CNVs from aCGH. The
underlying assumption is that genes showing shared expression patterns in tumors
of diﬀerent origins can be represented by the same loadings matrix. Therefore, in
order to estimate the factor scores for the new data, this translates into a well known
problem of inverse regression Fy = (Ik+B′Φ−1B)−1B′Φ−1Y, where B is the loadings
matrix and Φ the diagonal matrix containing the gene by gene variance estimators
in the original data, Y the new set of expression data and Fy the factor scores on the
new data set. With this approach, we estimated factor scores for the TCGA data
and calculated their correlations with CNVs. In our analysis, about half of the breast
expression factors are also associated with copy number variations in ovarian cancer
and that about a quarter are associated with CNVs in glioblastoma. For example,
the CNV activated expression pattern in breast cancer (not shown) is also discovered
in both ovarian cancer and glioblastoma within the same region (ﬁgure 2A and 2B).
Therefore, it is likely that similar CNVs might be selected under the same pressure
of hypoxia/ lactic acidosis in diﬀerence cancers.
2.4
Conclusions
This chapter has built upon a basic understanding of a layout on the correlation
between copy number variations and gene expression to deepen knowledge of key
concepts and methods. By introducing and comparing a diverse range of techniques
for measuring CNVs, we provide the scope of localizing cancer related genes using
diﬀerent platforms. By describing an appreciation of the use of several statistical
methods to assist the positioning of CNV regions, we are aimed to better identify
cancer driver mutations within the copy number gain/loss regions. Moreover, we
have also included examples from TCGA project to show the unique features of
29

CNV data.
The key challenge of ﬁnding candidate drivers is to distinguish it from passenger
genes, which are physically located close to the driver mutations and whose variations
are not causal to convey growth advantage on cancer cells. In our analysis, we focus
on genes with cis-regulated CNVs, and postulate that cancer driver mutation is
associated with the expression of a group of genes, and it is likely to localize in
DNA ampliﬁed or deleted regions in tumors. This is because DNA dosage variations
may result in functional changes of aﬀected genes, and thus cause expression change
of downstream genes.
We have proposed a generic framework to jointly analyze
disparate data sets, which is extendable to incorporate diverse information such
as proteomics data.
This will allow for more robust analysis of the relationship
between mRNA expression and protein abundance. Our results not only identify
candidate genes whose mRNA expression is statistically signiﬁcantly correlated with
their CNVs, but also successfully recover the region where similar gene expression
pattern is triggered by the same genomic program across tumors of diﬀerent organ
systems. This approach is able to estimate the probability of each gene regulated by
genomic sources and the relative importance of each source. Additionally, two genes,
EBAG9 and MTDH, suggest that abnormal abundance in their DNA copy numbers
may contribute to proliferation in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. For these two
predicted drivers, we also ﬁnd many CNVs in the same region but poorly correlated
with their gene expression, thus consider them no apparent eﬀect in cancer. Copy
number variation is only one of many ways that gene expression can be altered. We
believe that a number of complementary approaches are needed to validate possibly
driving alterations, as illustrated in the previous section. Therefore, we envision that
our model is used as screening guidance to assist the identiﬁcation of potential cancer
drivers with possibly therapeutic importance.
Our work presents a framework toward a broad understanding of the genomic
30

determinants of cancer. With this approach, we anticipate being able to generate
testable biological hypothesis regarding the regulation of cellular responses, which is
a tremendous advantage over any single data analyses that can be obtained from gene
expression or CNVs alone. This will lead to a greater, more integrated understanding
of cellular mechanism, and will allow the identiﬁcation of genomic regulators as well
as enhancement of anticancer drug speciﬁcity targeting those regulators.
This is
key to the discovery of potential combination therapies for the treatment of human
cancer.
Moreover, genomic patterns related to therapeutic response and clinical
outcomes can be identiﬁed as biomarkers, which will improve early cancer detection,
prognosis and outcome prediction as well as treatment selection.
All in all, this
will create a comprehensive picture of heterogeneity in tumor genomes, and oﬀer a
valuable starting point for new therapeutic approaches.

Nonparametric Joint Bayesian Factor Analysis–A
Vertical Integration Approach to Model
Multi-platform Genomics Data
A nonparametric Bayesian factor model is proposed for integrating multiple dis-
parate, but statistically related datasets. The approach is based on factorizing the
latent space (feature space) into a shared component and a data speciﬁc component
with the dimensionality of these components (spaces) inferred via a beta-Bernoulli
process. The proposed approach is demonstrated by jointly analyzing multiple types
of genomic data, including gene expressions, copy number variations and methyla-
tion for ovarian cancer patients, and show that the proposed model can potentially
uncover key drivers related to cancer.
3.1
Introduction
An important research problem in statistical signal processing and machine learning
is the integration/fusion of multiple disparate, but statistically related datasets. For
example, in genomic signal processing, integration of DNA copy number variation
35

and gene expression may help identify key drivers in cancer mechanism. Though
the range of potential applications is immense, the increase in data dimensionality,
data heterogeneity and the presence of noise often makes such data fusion problems
extremely challenging.
A key assumption employed when modeling such high-dimensional data is that
the intrinsic dimension of the data is much lower than the observed data dimen-
sion, i.e., the data lie in or are close to a low-dimensional subspace. For modeling
multiple disparate datasets, approaches often rely on the assumption that the data
are diﬀerent manifestations of a single shared low-dimensional latent space (feature
space).
The problem then lies in identifying this low-dimensional shared feature
space and the data speciﬁc mappings from this shared space to the observed data.
Classical data analysis techniques for multiple datasets, such as canonical correla-
tion analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936; Borga, 1998; Hardoon et al., 2004), compute
a low-dimensional shared linear embedding of a set of variables, such that the cor-
relations among the variables is maximized in the embedded space. Probabilistic
approaches to CCA have been proposed in (Bach and Jordan, 2005; Wang, 2007; Rai
and Daume, 2009). For joint analysis of multiple data sets, Bach and Jordan (2005);
Wang (2007); Rai and Daume (2009) assume the existence of underlying shared la-
tent variables and conditional independence of the data given the latent variables.
However the assumption of a single shared latent space may be limiting, and a more
ﬂexible approach is to factorize the latent space into a component that is shared
among all datasets and a component that is speciﬁc to each. Such models are more
likely to capture the shared features among all datasets while still preserving the
idiosyncratic features unique to each.
Bayesian and semi-Bayesian latent variable models have developed to factorize
the latent space into a shared and data-speciﬁc part (Archambeau and Bach, 2008;
Klami and Kaski, 2008). However, in these approaches the number of latent factors
36

are chosen a priori. Alternatively, one may consider multiple factor models, each
with a diﬀerent number of factors, and perform model selection based on information
criteria such as AIC (Akaike, 1987) or BIC (Schwarz, 1978). However, as it is often
challenging to check modeling assumptions in high-dimensions, a nonparametric or
semiparametric model is desirable.
In this chapter we propose a nonparametric
Bayesian factor analysis approach for integrating multiple heterogeneous datasets,
with the number of factors inferred from the available data. Our proposed approach
is based on factoring the latent space into shared and data-speciﬁc components,
employing a beta-Bernoulli process (Griﬃths and Ghahramani, 2005; Thibaux and
Jordan, 2007; Paisley and Carin, 2009) to infer the dimension of these latent spaces.
We demonstrate the proposed approach on the joint analysis of genomic data for
ovarian cancer patients, including three diﬀerent datasets: gene expressions levels,
copy number variations and DNA methylation levels data. We demonstrate that the
joint analysis of gene expressions/copy number variations and gene expressions/DNA
methylation levels can potentially identify genomic and epigenomic regulators inﬂu-
encing cancer pathophysiology outcomes.
A preliminary version of the model developed in this chapter was presented in
(Ray and Carin, 2011). However, this chapter extends substantially (Ray and Carin,
2011) and includes the analysis of a new dataset (heterogeneous genomic data) and
also provides detailed theoretical analysis as well as stronger empirical justiﬁcation
of the model. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: In Section 3.2 we
present the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for jointly analyzing heterogeneous
data and in Section 3.6 we demonstrate the performance of the joint factor model
on the analysis of heterogeneous genomic data.
37

3.2
Joint Bayesian factor analysis-a nonparametric model
Let

X(r)	
r=1,R represent data from R diﬀerent modalities, where X(r) = (x(r)
1 , . . . ,
x(r)
M ) ∈RNr×M. In sparse factor modeling, learning a single shared matrix of factor
loadings for diﬀerent signal classes has been proposed in (Mairal et al., 2008). How-
ever for heterogeneous data such as that considered here, learning a shared set of
factor loadings is more diﬃcult.
The joint factor model may be represented as
X(r) = D(r)  W (c) + W (r)
+ E(r)
(3.1)
The matrix D(r) = (d(r)
1 , . . . , d(r)
K ) ∈RNr×K consists of the factor loadings speciﬁc
to data modality r, factor scores W (r) = (w(r)
1 , . . . , w(r)
M ) ∈RK×M are speciﬁc to
data from modality r, W (c) = (w(c)
1 , . . . , w(c)
M ) ∈RK×M consists of the factor scores
common among all modalities, and E(r) = (ϵ(r)
1 , . . . , ϵ(r)
M ) ∈RNr×M consists of the
noise/residual speciﬁc to data of modality r.
We wish to impose the condition that any x(r)
i
is a sparse linear combination of
the factor loadings. Hence, the factor scores are represented as,
w(r)
i
= s(r)
i
⊙b(r)

and
w(c)
i
= s(c)

⊙b(c)

where s(r)

i
∈RK, b(r)
i
∈{0, 1}K, b(c)
i
∈{0, 1}K and ⊙represents the
Hadamard product (elementwise vector product).
The sparse binary vectors b(r)
i
are drawn from the following beta-Bernoulli process

with πk representing the kth component of π and α ∈(0, 1).
In practice K is
ﬁnite, and the above equation represents a ﬁnite approximation to the beta-Bernoulli
process, where the number of non-zero components of each b(r)
i
is a random variable
drawn from Binomial (K, α). If α is set to
ρ
K, in the limit K →∞this reduces
to the number of non-zero components in b(r)
i
being drawn from Poisson(ρ); this
corresponds to the Indian buﬀet process (IBP) (Griﬃths and Ghahramani, 2005;
Thibaux and Jordan, 2007; Paisley and Carin, 2009). We may therefore explicitly
impose a prior belief on the number of non-zero components in w(r)
i . The shared
binary vectors b(c)
i
are modeled similarly as b(r)
i . The noise or residual in (3.1) is
modeled as
ϵ(r)

∼N(0, γ(r)

−1INr),
γ(r)
ϵ
∼Gamma(a0, b0)
(3.5)
where INr represents the Nr × Nr identity matrix.
The construction in (3.1) imposes the belief that there are underlying (low-
dimensional) features represented by the factor scores that may be shared across
modalities, via W (c); however, each modality has a unique mapping from these low-
dimensional factor scores to the high-dimensional data, reﬂected by D(r). Further,
each modality may also have idiosyncratic low-dimensional features, characterized
by W (r). The common and idiosyncratic features are learned jointly, via the si-
multaneous analysis of all modalities. A unique feature of the above construction is
that it allows complete sharing of some low-dimensional features across diﬀerent data
39

modalities as well as partial sharing, i.e., a shared feature may be slightly perturbed
via W (r) and shared across diﬀerent modalities.

In the absence of covariates, the factor loadings may be drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian
distribution (for ease of notation, we henceforth drop the modality index r, unless
referring to multiple data modalities simultaneously),
dk ∼N(0, γ−1
s IN),
γs ∼Gamma(a5, b5)
(3.6)
3.3.2
Imposing sparsity
In many biological applications, it is desirable that the factor loading matrix is sparse
(Carvalho et al., 2008a). To impose sparsity on the factor loadings, we employ a
Student-t sparseness-promoting prior (Tipping, 2001). In this construction, djk, the
jth component of dk, is drawn
djk ∼N(0, τ −1
jk )
(3.7)
τjk ∼Gamma(a1, b1)
(3.8)
However, there are multiple ways one may desire to impose sparsity, such as using the
spike-slab prior (Ishwaran and Rao, 2005; Carvalho et al., 2008a; Chen et al., 2011).
This consists of a discrete-continuous mixture of a point mass at zero, referred to
as the ‘spike’, and any other distribution, such as the Gaussian distribution, known
as the ‘slab’. A hierarchical beta-Bernoulli construction of the spike-slab prior for
imposing sparsity on the factor loadings is provided in (Chen et al., 2011). We found
that the spike-slab prior works as well as the model presented above; however, for
40

the sake of brevity, we include only the results for the Student-t sparseness prior in
this chapter.
3.4
Imposing structure on factor scores
In the simplest scenario, the factor scores may be drawn i.i.d.
from a Gaussian
distribution as,
s(r)
i
∼N(0, γ−1
r IK)
s(c)
i
∼N(0, γ−1
c IK)
(3.9)
We impose broad gamma prior on γr and γc: γr ∼Gamma(a2, b2) and γc ∼Gamma
(a3, b3).
3.5
MCMC inference
The conditional posterior distribution of all the model parameters for the joint factor
model may be derived analytically. We use a Gibbs sampler to draw samples from
the posterior distribution of the model parameters. For the factor analysis results
on multiple genomic data presented in Sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, the number of Gibbs
burn-in samples is set to 3000 and the number of collection samples is set to 1000.
Broad gamma hyperpriors are chosen for the variance terms with a0 = b0 = a2 =
b2 = a3 = b3 = 10−5. The results are relatively insensitive to these settings and
various other settings such as a0 = b0 = a2 = b2 = a3 = b3 = 10−3 or a0 = b0 = a2 =
b2 = a3 = b3 = 10−6 yielded very similar results. The shrinkage parameters on the
factor loadings are set at a1 = 10−3 and b1 = 10−6 (for Gene-copy number analysis
results) and a1 = 1 and b1 = 10−2 (for Gene-Methylation analysis results).
Since much correlation is encoded in the priors, the mixing of the MCMC sampler
was also carefully examined. The sampler was run extensively for diﬀerent number
of burn-in and collection samples. It was also run multiple times in parallel with
41

diﬀerent initial values. The results of these experiments were found to be consistent
and repeatable across such runs.
3.6
Joint analysis of multi-platform genomic data
There are numerous publications on combining diﬀerent types of DNA modiﬁcations
with gene expression. Perhaps the most natural of these are the brute force methods
such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis (Kendziorski et al., 2006).
Joint analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with gene expression
data by eQTL involves testing every gene-SNP pair for association with a t-test, then
corrects for multiple hypothesis testing. CNAmet (Louhimo and Hautaniemi, 2011)
deﬁnes a similar approach to relate gene expression changes with either copy number
change or DNA methylation. Other approaches use well established models for each
of the individual data types, then combine the results into a statistic that addresses
the problem of interest. The approach of Jeong et al. (2010) is an example of this for
the identiﬁcation of genes that are regulated by DNA methylation. A shortcomming
of all of these approaches is that they do not reduce the dimension of the individual
data sets through an accounting of their respective correlation structures.
In (Lanckriet et al., 2004) the authors used kernel functions predeﬁned for each
data type, and mapped to the same vector space, which allows joint analysis in the
common range of the kernels. Copy number and expression in cancer (CONEXIC)
(Akavia et al., 2010) has been proposed as a Bayesian scoring function that measures
how well a set of candidate gene regulators correlate with the expression of gene
modules (groups of genes that are correlated with each other). Another approach
(Lucas et al., 2010) utilizes a sparse factor model to model the correlation structure
of the gene expression data, but uses post-hoc hypothesis tests to draw connections
between gene expression and copy number data.
These approaches do allow for
eﬀective dimension reduction, but don’t use correlation structure in one data set to
42

inform estimations of correlation in the others.
The most direct approach to jointly modeling the correlation structure of heter-
geneous genomic data is to require the factor matrix to be shared, as in Shen et al.
(2009). Their model does not contain a data-type-speciﬁc factor structure equiva-
lent to W (r) in our model, and is therefore somewhat less ﬂexible. In addition, they
utilize standard normal distributions on the elements of the factor matrix, eliminat-
ing the possibility of discovering factors that are relevant for only a subset of the
subjects.
Data description
The data in this study includes ovarian cancer gene expression, copy number varia-
tion (CNV) and methylation data collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
project (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). We aim to integrate gene expression/CNVs
and gene expression/methylation from 74 ovarian cancer patients. For computing
purposes, we downsized the original massive data into smaller sets. Independent
gene-by-gene ﬁltering (based on criteria such as overall mean and overall variance)
is typically employed to reduce data dimension as well as increase the number of
discoveries in high-throughput experiments (Bourgon et al., 2010; Gentleman et al.,
2005; Talloen et al., 2007). In our analysis, a ﬁltering criteria was established for
the gene expression data to eliminate probes with sample mean below 6, or standard
deviation below 0.4, which resulted in a gene expression data set downsized from
22277 to 5976. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data was ﬁltered to re-
move Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A probes containing missing values. This set
was further ﬁltered by keeping only one in 50 probes, leaving 4443 probes. Methy-
lation data (Illumina Inﬁnium human methylation 27K bead assay) was ﬁltered to
retain only higher variance samples (resulting in 4722 probes) and was inverse-probit
transformed to lie on the real line.

3.6.1
Analysis of gene expression and copy number variation data
We applied the joint Bayesian factor model to gene expression and CGH in order to
identify factors that are representative of correlated changes in gene expression and
DNA copy number variations. We set the upper bound on the number of factors as
K = 60, and obtained 1 speciﬁc to gene expression, 4 unique to CNVs and 19 shared
between both modalities (Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.2 shows the correlation structure of the probe sets (gene expression)
and CGH clones (CNVs) that are included in joint factor number 41 (the factor
numbering is arbitrary, and changes between collection samples, with these results are
illustrative; in these and related results we depict the maximum likelihood collection
sample). As expected, correlation between the factor genes for those patients who
were included in this factor is higher than for those not included.
It is well known that some variations in cancer gene expression are caused by gene
dosage changes due to CNVs. In addition, because of the mechanism by which CNV
occurs, it tends to happen in contiguous regions. Of the 20 CNV factors identiﬁed,
one is a nearly perfect representation of batch eﬀects in the data and the remaining 19
display copy number ampliﬁcation/deletion in speciﬁc chromosomal regions. Most of
these show similar gene expression changes in the same region. We demonstrate this
behavior in Figure 3.3, which shows that the largest factor loadings from both CNV
and gene expression for factor 18 are clustered around the same region of chromosome
8.
We identiﬁed highly associated copy number variations in the chromosomal arm
8q12.3-8q24.13 (factor 18), which is a known region for frequent high-level amplica-
tion associated with disease progression in human cancers (Frank et al., 2007; Pils
et al., 2005). The rediscovery of genes in this region also validates our approach. For
example, E2F5 (8q21.2, Unique ID: 1875), an important gene in the regulation of the
44

cell cycle, is known to be overexpressed in ovarian epithelial cancer (Kothandaraman
et al., 2010). Over-expressed genes, MTDH (8q22.1, Unique ID: 92140) and EBAG9
(8q23, Unique ID: 9166), have been recognized in a variety of cancers including ovar-
ian and breast cancers (Akahira et al., 2004; Rennstam et al., 2003; Emdad et al.,
2007). Another gene in this region whose expression level is known to be important
in cancer biology is WWP1 (8q21, Unique ID: 11059). This recapitulation of some
of the well known features of aneuploidy in cancer suggests that our joint model
is appropriately capturing correlation structure between gene expression and CGH
data.
As described above, many factors we obtained are associated with individual
chromosomal locations, as demonstrated in Figure 3.3.
However, there is also a
subset of factors (1, 14, 32, 41, 45, 57) which are representative of multiple regions.
Figure 3.4 shows that the largest factor loadings in CNV/gene expression for factor
41 come from both chromosome 6 and 17. This is the explanation of the checkerboard
regions of positive and negative correlation in Figure 3.2 as well. The copy number
variations from the top ranked CGH probes in the two locations are highly negatively
correlated, with copy number gain in chromosome 6 and loss in the other. There
are a number of possible mechanistic explanations for this feature. For example,
it is possible that wholesale duplication of one region is lethal to the cells without
shutting down the apoptosis pathway. Such a shut down might be accomplished by
deletion of other regions. Previous approaches to the joint analysis of gene expression
and CNV through the use of factor models, such as Lucas et al. (2010), have failed
to ﬁnd these relationships.
The proposed joint factor model provides the ﬂexibility of discovering factors that
are relevant only for a subset of the subjects. It is interesting to note that a similar
model which enforces that all subjects are included in the inferred factors, performed
poorly compared to the proposed model and discovered much fewer factors which
45

captured correlated changes in gene expressions and copy number variations.
3.6.2
Analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation data
For computational purpose, we selected probes with highest variances across samples
and obtained 1000 probes for both gene expression and methylation. 18 common fac-
tors were thus inferred between the two data sets. Unlike CNVs, methylation does
not typically occur in contiguous regions, therefore it is not surprising that no re-
gional peaks were detected. Methylation acts as an epigenetic regulator and silences
tumor suppressor genes by changing chromosomal structures. We detected a gene,
SPON1(11p15.2, Unique ID: 10418), which appears to be predominantly regulated
by methylation of its CpG site (Figure 3.5). Elevated expression of this gene relative
to normal tissue is a known hallmark of ovarian cancer (Pyle-Chenault et al., 2005),
however, the mechanism of this overexpression was previously unknown. SPON1
encodes VSGP/F-spondin protein promoting proliferation in vascular smooth cell
during ovarian folliculogenesis, which has been identiﬁed as a potential diagnos-
tic marker or therapeutic target for ovarian carcinoma (Pyle-Chenault et al., 2005;
Miyamoto et al., 2001).
In contrast to the almost single gene precision of factor 5, factor 24 shows strong
correlation between methylation and gene expression in many diﬀerent loci across
the entire genome (Figure 3.6). The list of CpG sites heavily loaded on this factor
are displayed in Table 3.1. Pathway analysis on these candidate genes reveals that
many are involved in DNA binding and regulation of transcription. The correla-
tion of methylation levels at all of these sites combined with their correlated gene
expression levels suggests that they are all the targets of a single methlylation pro-
gram, however, the existence of coordinated methylation enzymes that target these
locations is unconﬁrmed.
We implemented the joint factor model for analysis of multiple genomic data in
46

non-optimized Matlab on a quad core PC with 2.2 GHz CPU and 4 GB ram. The
average time per iteration of the Gibbs sampler for the results in Section 3.6.1 is 72
seconds and for the results in Section 3.6.2 is 55 seconds.

Discussion
3.7.1
Batch eﬀects
TCGA project collected tumor samples in diﬀerent institutions and at diﬀerent times,
and thus the data can be vulnerable to systematic noise such as batch eﬀects. In the
nonparametric joint Bayesian factor analysis model, we applied the same shrinkage
prior on all the factor loadings, and thus inferred some factors that represent batch
eﬀects rather than genetic variances. Without explicitly modeling the confounding
eﬀects, it may cause diﬃculty in interpretation.
Since the batch information is
available from TCGA, we can add design matrix to model the sample-wise batch
eﬀects. Chapter 2 implemented this procedure using the parametric version of the
joint FA model. We found the coeﬃcients of the corresponding design vectors tend
to be dense, as opposed to the sparse loadings. The latter captures the genetic eﬀects
well. Therefore, we may add the same design matrix to the nonparametric joint FA
model, and that will distinguish batch eﬀects from genetic variances.
In addition, even after the batch eﬀects removal procedure, it is possible that some
factors still constitute biological or experimental confounders, while the remaining
factors that represent genetically driven variants. In such case, we wish to separately
model the confounding components as dense factors and others as sparse factors by
imposing diﬀerent levels of shrinkage. The proportion of factors being confounders
or signals can be inferred by imposing a beta-Bernoulli prior on a binary indicator
matrix, where confounding factors are inferred with assignment 1 indicating the
corresponding loadings have a ﬂat gamma prior, or vice versa. This allows fully
automated learning from the data, which eases the interpretation.
47

3.7.2
Comparison between the parametric and nonparametric joint FA model
In chapters 2 and 3, We proposed two joint FA models, respectively, to vertically in-
tegrate diﬀerent genomics data and infer driver mutations in cancer. The hypotheses
between two methods are similar that they assume the data is a linear combination
of latent factors plus idiosyncratic noise, where the latent factor space can be further
decomposed into a shared component representing the correlation among diﬀerent
data modalities as well as a data-speciﬁc component. However, they diﬀer in many
ways.
The parametric model links heterogeneous datasets by sampling the factor scores
of one data modality around the other, assuming that they have similar values. It
is ﬂexible enough to incorporate large/small sample-wise variances in the sampling
distribution.
This addresses the issue of large dimensionality discrepancy among
diﬀerent array platforms.The nonparametric model constrains the common factors
to be exactly the same for diﬀerent data modalities. It simpliﬁes model assumption,
which is easier for computation, especially with more than two data modalities.
The parametric model takes into account batch eﬀects, which are omitted by
the nonparametric model. Therefore, in chapter 3, some factors reﬂect such eﬀect.
Section 3.7.1 proposes possible solutions to address this problem.
The main advantage of the nonparametric model is to infer number of factors,
shared and unique components automatically from the data. While for parametric
model, we need to specify these parameters in advance, which becomes hard to verify
especially in high dimension.
In summary, both methods will work for modeling only two datasets.
When
number of data modalities becomes larger, it seems more straightforward to use the
nonparametric approach and infer one set of common factors based on multiple data
modalities. On the other hand, the parametric method requires modeling a pair of
48

two datasets at a time.
3.8
Conclusions
A nonparametric joint factor analysis method is introduced for modeling multiple
disparate but statistically related data. The proposed approach was demonstrated
on the joint analysis of heterogeneous genomic data related to ovarian cancer. The
proposed model uncovered key drivers of cancer, some of which have been previously
reported in literature as well as some new genomic causes of cancer (potentially).
In this chapter we have focussed on integrating multiple heterogeneous but sta-
tistically correlated datasets, via a joint factor analysis approach where the latent
space is factorized into a shared component and data speciﬁc components. Moreover,
data speciﬁc linear mappings from the latent space to the observation spaces where
obtained via joint analysis of all data modalities. However, for certain applications,
the assumption that the data lie in or close to a low-dimensional subspace is restric-
tive and a better assumption is that the data lie on a manifold. In the future we wish
to relax the linearity assumption of our joint factor model via a mixture of factor
analyzers (MFA) approach.

Joint Bayesian Factor Analysis–A Horizontal
Integration Approach to Model Diverse Gene
Expression Data for Pathway Analysis
Pathway analysis has become a central approach to understanding the underlying
biology of diﬀerentially expressed genes. As large amounts of microarray data have
been accumulated in public repositories, ﬂexible methodologies are needed to extend
the analysis of simple case-control studies in order to place them in context with
the vast quantities of available and highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this
challenge, we have developed a two-level model, consisting of 1) a joint Bayesian
factor model that integrates multiple microarray experiments and ties each factor to
a predeﬁned pathway 2) a point mass mixture distribution that infers which factors
are relevant/irrelevant to each dataset. Our method can identify pathways speciﬁc to
a particular experimental trait or concurrently induced/repressed under a variety of
interventions. In this chapter we describe the model in depth and provide examples
of its utility in simulations as well as real data from a study of radiation exposure.
Our analysis of the radiation study leads to novel insights into the molecular basis of
57

time- and dose- dependent response to ionizing radiation in mice peripheral blood.
This broadly applicable model provides a starting point for generating speciﬁc and
testable hypotheses in a pathway-centric manner.
4.1
Introduction
High-throughput technologies have enabled comprehensive monitoring of biologi-
cal systems. They provide an entry point to uncovering molecular mechanisms by
genome-wide searches for cellular changes in response to any experimental pertur-
bation. However, the generation of large proﬁles leads to diﬃculties with interpre-
tation. Researchers have developed knowledge bases (Vastrik et al., 2007; Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000) to help tackle this hurdle. These include databases of biological
processes or functional groups that explain gene-pathway memberships as well as
interactions among genes. By mapping genes in a list to pathways in a database
one can decipher molecular mechanisms that link the biological characteristic of the
predeﬁned gene set to experimental traits. This approach helps scientists to identify
pathways associated with disease which can lead to hypotheses regarding pathway-
speciﬁc biomarkers and drug targets.
There are a number of approaches to identifying statistically signiﬁcant associ-
ations between gene lists or gene expression proﬁles and pathways. Given a set of
genes and a predeﬁned pathway, we say that the gene set is enriched for the pathway
if the overlap between the two sets of genes is signiﬁcantly higher than expected by
chance (Shamir, 2010). The particular statistics used for estimating enrichment vary
by package and include Fisher exact probability, z-score, Chi-square, hypergeomet-
ric distribution and binomial distribution (Huang et al., 2009a). In recent years, a
number of publicly available high-throughput functional annotation tools have been
proposed using this type of approach.
DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery)
58

(Dennis et al., 2003) adopted the EASE score (Hosack et al., 2003). It utilizes the
Fisher exact test to assess whether the overlap between a gene list and pathway is
signiﬁcant. A jackkniﬁng procedure is applied to assess the stability of the statis-
tic. Interpretation from DAVID relies on a scoring system of negative logarithmic
transformed p-values which leads to suggestions for possible relevant annotations.
Another type of enrichment method takes into account the gene-phenotype corre-
lations. GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) (Subramanian et al., 2005) ranks the
genes based on the signiﬁcance of diﬀerential expression between two experimental
groups (e.g. disease versus control), then uses a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov(K-
S)-like-statistic to compute a gene-set-wise enrichment score (ES). It is designed to
evaluate enrichment only in two classes, which imposes a fundamental challenge if
a large cohort of data is queried with continuous or multiple phenotypic categories.
In order to analyze large transcriptional proﬁles such as those available in GEO
(Edgar et al., 2002) simultaneously, we need a diﬀerent approach to assess pathway
variabilities across a heterogeneous population with diverse phenotypic traits.
Gower et al. (2011) developed openSESAME (Search of Expression Signature
Across Many Experiments); This algorithm ﬁrst calculates a signature association
(SA) score for each experimental sample with user deﬁned ”up-” and ”down-” reg-
ulated gene sets. SA summarizes the expression signature of a particular sample as
induction, repression, or not changed under a Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic. It then
identiﬁes enriched datasets that display co-expression patterns that are similar to the
query signature using either K-S or Fisher’s exact test. Without the prior knowl-
edge of phenotypic traits, openSESAME searches for coherent diﬀerential expression
across numerous biological states. However, since the algorithm is designed to query
one signature at a time, it is diﬃcult to extend for a simultaneous query across a
wide variety of gene signatures.
None of the above mentioned methods take gene correlations into account, which
59

might result in an increased volume of false positive rates (Tamayo et al., 2012).
GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) (Hanzelmann et al., 2013) was thus proposed.
This approach uses a Gaussian kernel to estimate the cumulative density function of
normalized gene expression data. It follows methods similar to GSEA, which calcu-
lates sample-wise enrichment score using maximum deviation of K-S-like-statistic, or
normalized ES to account for concordantly over-/under-expressed genes in a path-
way. It does not perform pathway-wise enrichment analysis. Instead it requires an
additional step of hypothesis testing between experimental and control groups, the
evaluation of which eventually depends on the choice of signiﬁcance threshold. The
kernel function does not account for variances among diﬀerent data sets, therefore,
without modiﬁcation it cannot be applied to integrate multiple microarray experi-
ments.
Our approach to this problem is to extend a factor model-based approach because
of its practical application in genomic studies (Zheng and Lucas, 2012; Lucas et al.,
2010, 2009, 2006). The factor analysis framework allows dimension reduction and
estimation of correlation structure in the context of high-dimensional gene expression
data. One objection to this approach is that it generates results that are diﬃcult to
interpret. In order to address this, we associate each factor to a predeﬁned pathway
or gene set through the use of strongly informative priors. The model is capable of in-
corporating a large collection of diﬀerent experimental data sets, which leverages the
ever-growing body of publically available transcriptional proﬁles. In this chapter, we
perform pathway selection which simpliﬁes the decision-making procedure of deter-
mining which pathway/gene set is most represented under a variety of experimental
perturbations. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: we present the
proposed model in the Methods section, and provide examples of its utility using
both synthetic data and a study of radiation exposure. Comparison with existing
pathway analysis methods is discussed afterwards, followed by conclusions.

Methods
Let g ∈1 · · · G be an index over genes, d ∈1 · · · D be the index over data sets and
j ∈1 · · · Nd be an index over samples in data set d. We assume a latent factor
model for the expression of a particular gene, data set and sample, xg,d,j. The model
includes a gene and data set speciﬁc mean expression, µg,d and idiosyncratic noise
ϵg,d,j. We assume that there are K factors with p × K dimensional loadings matrix
β and latent factor expression levels for each factor, data set and sample, fk,d,j.

(4.1)
Because we are working with experimental interventions in the background of
relatively homogeneous biology, we expect that some factors will be relevant to some
data sets and not others and we expect data set speciﬁc residuals. With this in mind,
we use point mass mixture prior distributions for F that allow factors to be zero for
some data sets and non-zero for others. We utilize the notation 0 and 1 to denote
vectors of zeros and ones respectively. The length of the vectors will be implied by
the data set to which the variable is associated.

Where variance 1 is assumed in order to address non-identiﬁability issues between
the scale of β and F.
There are a number of published approaches to latent factor modeling that im-
pose constraints on the loadings matrix in order to identify the model. Examples
include principal components, non-negative factorization (Schmidt et al., 2009) and
sparse factorization (Bhattacharya and Dunson, 2011). We are, however particularly
interested in relating our results to known gene pathways such as those published in
the KEGG database. As such, we propose a strongly informative prior distribution
on the factor loadings matrix that relates each factor to a known pathway through
the identiﬁcation of which genes have non-zero loadings. We presume that the kth
pathway in our database consists of a list of genes that belong in the pathway. Let
zg,k ∈{0, 1} indicate whether gene g is in pathway k. We assume βg,k = ag,kzg,k,
which forces the loading for a gene to be zero if the gene is not in the predeﬁned path-
way. While this restricts model ﬂexibility signiﬁcantly, it oﬀers a resolution to one of
the loudest criticisms of factor models for gene expression data by providing a clear
interpretation to the meaning of each factor. To complete the model speciﬁcation,
we assume that ag,k ∼N(mg,k, φg,k).
4.3
Experiments: Synthetic data
In this section, we perform a variety of experiments to evaluate the eﬀectiveness and
accuracy of our proposed model. We generate synthetic data from the model under
a few diﬀerent circumstances.
Parameters common to all synthetic data generation
We consider the data is of size {G, D, K} = {9986, 5, 219}. This is chosen to approx-
imately match the size of the radiation exposure data we will analyze later. We set
a series of 5 datasets, the sample sizes of which are 10, 20, 30, 70, and 250. We use
62

an external pathway database, Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Liberzon
et al., 2011) from which we take 219 mouse speciﬁc pathways, the union of which
contains 9986 genes that are measured in our system. We use a range of data set
and pathway sizes in order to evaluate how well our approach can recover known
parameters under diﬀerent conditions. The model parameters are drawn from the
following distributions.

We create a sparsity matrix z from the pathway database and set β = a ⊕z
where ⊕denotes element-wise multiplication. We draw xg,d,j using equation 4.1.
Hyperparameters are set as {α0, κ0, e0, l0, u0, n0, c0, d0, a0, b0, m0, s0} =
{1, 10, 10, 90, 0, 1, 1.1, 1, 1.1, 0.01, 8, 2}. We run the Gibbs sampler for 500 iterations
and use the ﬁrst 250 as burin-in. This process is repeated 10 times.
Ranges of sparsity in factor utilization, τ0
In the ﬁrst scenario, we want to explore diﬀerent sparsity options of the feature
selection matrix γ, and examine which setting results in a more accurate estimation.
The sparsity is determined by τ0, the range of which is set in Table 4.1. Results from
the above simulation show that the model correctly learns factors used to generate
the data and infers the mixing combination well. We use ROC curve to compare the
estimated binary pathway selection matrix γ with its ground truth. Figure 4.1(a)
shows that given the condition where most pathways are represented in the datasets
(τ0 = 0.7), our model can recover the pathway-dataset association accurately with
63

averaged AUC>90% for experiments of diﬀerent sizes. As shown in Table 4.1, results
obtained from 70 samples and 250 samples are quite similar (mean AUC=0.99189
and 0.99137, respectively), but the smallest dataset (sized at 10 samples) yields a
slightly lower accuracy (mean AUC=0.96741). As the feature selection matrix γ
gets more sparse (τ0 = 0.3), the impact of sample size becomes more obvious. As
shown in Figure 4.1(b), our model is still capable of recovering most of factors, but
we ﬁnd (i) the mean AUC for each dataset drops, (ii) there is a slight decrease in
statistical power and (iii) there is an increased type-I error rate (Figure 4.2 and Table
4.1). We also compare the model estimates with the ground truth for every other
parameter. The probabilities of true values falling into 95% credible intervals of their
corresponding estimates are Pr(µ ∈[ˆµ α
2 , ˆµ1−α
2 ]) = 0.92, Pr(θ ∈[ˆθ α
2 , ˆθ1−α
2 ]) = 0.92
and Pr(a ∈[ˆa α
2 , ˆa1−α
2 ]) = 0.94, where α = 0.05. We normalized ˆa before comparing
with its ground truth, because the scale is subject to change in loadings, and the
real value is sampled from a standard normal distribution. The comparison results
are similar for both simulations with diﬀerent sparsity settings.
Impure pathways
Another scenario is to simulate partial pathways/gene sets. Since not all the genes
in a pathway will be turned on/oﬀsimultaneously, some genes are rubbish thus not
contributing to the overall signal. In light of this, we randomly selected 40% from
the original 219 pathways to which we assign a varying number of noise genes. We
create noise genes by setting the loading, ag,k ∼N(ag,k; 0, 0.01), thus ensuring that
the expression of the corresponding gene consists almost entirely of idiosyncratic
noise. The proportion of garbage genes for any particular pathway ranges from 10%
to 90% in 10% increments. We use τ0 = 0.7 with all other settings remaining as
above. Classiﬁcation result on γ is quite accurate with averaged AUC above 90%
for data sets larger than or equal to 20 samples, if the ratio of noise genes is between
64

10% and 70%. As shown in Figure 4.3(a), the larger the sample size is, the more
accurate the classiﬁcation becomes. While the smallest data (sized at 10) performs
less accurately (averaged AUC below 90%). The AUC curve ﬂuctuates a little and
drops below 0.9 if 80-90% of genes in the pathways are useless. Figure 4.3(b) and
4.3(c) further examines these results through comparisons of statistical power and
type-I error rates, respectively. For those ’garbage’ pathways correctly identiﬁed as
relevant to the datasets, their loadings from point estimate successfully shrink the
’rubbish’ genes towards zero.
4.4
Experiment: Ionizing radiation
4.4.1
Data collection
A total of 355 C57BL/6 mice peripheral blood gene expression proﬁles were mea-
sured in 3 diﬀerent batches using the Aﬀymetrix mouse 430A 2.0 microarray. The
experiment is designed to assess blood gene expression changes after exposure to
ionizing radiation between 0 and 1050 cGy. Samples were collected at 6, 24, 48,
72, 120 and 168hrs after a single dose exposure. In order to place resulting gene
expression changes in context, we also incorporate 7 additional murine datasets from
GEO (Parkitna et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Jaﬀe et al., 2010; Beier et al., 2011;
De Zoeten et al., 2011; Habermehl et al., 2011). These samples all came from the
same mouse strain and microarray platform but were treated under diﬀerent con-
ditions. A detailed overview of each dataset can be found in Table 4.2. We use
pathways from the knowledgebase that are pertinent to radiation and blood cells
from GSEA MSigDB. A total of 222 pathways, including C2 (curated) and C3 (mo-
tif) gene sets, were selected. These contain 10571 probes belonging to the mice Aﬀy
array, as shown in Figure 4.4.
65

4.4.2
Data analysis
We conduct 10000 MCMC iterations with 6000 burn-in samples. The hyperparame-
ters are set to {α0, κ0, e0, l0, u0, n0, c0, d0, a0, b0, m0, s0} = {1, 10, 10, 90, 0, 1, 1.1,
0.01, 1.1, 1, 8, 2}. Pathway selection is inferred by computing the posterior odds in
favor of γk,d,· = 1. The model selects factors using posterior probability threshold
greater than 0.5. This results in 75 factors shared across the 3 radiation batches,
of which 15 are also found to be associated with gene expression changes in some
subset of the GEO sets (Figure 4.5).
Clustering of pathway responsive patterns induced by radiation
Because of the high degree of co-expression between many genes in this experiment
as well as the experiments downloaded from GEO, we ﬁnd that there are numerous
cases in which groups of pathways share a common expression pattern across samples.
A tree structure (Henao et al., 2013) was used to organize the identiﬁed pathways
into groups based on this shared expression. In order to examine pathway activity
among diﬀerent cell lines, we display only the clustering results from 26 gene sets of
such features (Figure 4.6). Four groups of pathways are thus obtained.
Cluster 1. Figure 4.7 shows a generalized pattern of repression in a dose-dependent
manner. Speciﬁcally, expression increases from 6 to 168 hrs at high dose levels (600
∼1050 cGy), while for low-dose exposure (200 ∼450 cGy) it increments to baseline
at 72 hrs but decreases afterwards, and it shows faster recovery rate at a lower dose
100 cGy, and reaches baseline at 24 hrs.
Pathways in this group include gene sets down regulated in ﬁbroblast cell lines
after high dose UV-C exposure (Gentile et al., 2003) (factor 64), and those up-
regulated in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells (Han et al., 2012) (factor 98).
CLP cells can be further diﬀerentiated into B cells, the process of which was reported
to be aﬀected by radiation in bone marrow (Han et al., 2012).
66

Cluster 2. Figure 4.8 shows the behavior of genes in pathways from this cluster.
Expression is slightly repressed at 6 hrs and maintaining an induction pattern from
48 to 168 hrs with high dose radiation treatment, in contrast, low dose exposure
suppresses gene expression from 120 to 168 hrs.
Pathways in this group are associated with regulation of cell death (Smirnov
et al., 2012) (factor 190), those speciﬁc to mast cells (Nakajima et al., 2001) (fac-
tor 130) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (Georgantas et al., 2004) (factor 70).
Proliferation of mast cells has been shown to be aﬀected by ultraviolet or infrared
radiation (Kim et al., 2009); It is possible that ionizing radiation triggers a similar
mechanism. HSC are considered to be somewhat resistant to radiation, and may
be important for regeneration of the hematopoietic system after radiation damage.
The pathway reported in (Sesto et al., 2002) (factor 185) whose expression changed
in human primary keratinocytes by UVB irradiation is also found to be activated in
our experiment. Examples of this group are RRAS (gene related to RAS viral (r-ras)
oncogene homolog) and GADD45A (gene involved in growth arrest and induced in
response to DNA damage).
Cluster 3. Figure 4.9 shows that, for genes in this cluster, radiation induces up-
regulation from 6 to 120 hrs with a maximum at 48 or 72 hrs, which then return
to basal levels at 168 hrs except that high doses further repress the expression.
One element of this cluster is intrathymic T progenitor (ITTP) (Lee et al., 2004)
(factor 116). It is the earliest progenitor; genes in this pathway show a diﬀerent
expression pattern after radiation stimulation, compared to the ones associated with
more matured T thymocytes (cluster 4).
Cluster 4. Figure 4.10 shows that this group of pathways are slightly up-regulated
at 6 hrs and keep a repression pattern from 48 to 168 hrs after high level radiation ex-
posure, whereas low dose exposure induces up-regulation from 120 to 168 hrs. Path-
ways in this group include epigenomic biomarkers in acute lymphoblastic leukemia
67

(Taylor et al., 2007) (factor 195) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (Nouzova et al.,
2004) (factor 138), suggesting novel targets for radiotherapy monitoring. Gene sets
enriched in both double polar (DP) (factor 113) and single positive 4 (SP4) thymo-
cytes (factor 119) show this pattern of expression changes in our data. Many DP
genes are found to be involved in cell cycle progression or proliferation and are re-
lated to thymocyte diﬀerentiation into T/B/NK cells. SP4 enriched genes are known
to be important for T cell functions, such as inhibition of T cell apoptosis, regula-
tion of T cell homeostasis and T cell diﬀerentiation (Lee et al., 2004). Given this
evidence as well as our discovery of depressed gene expression activities in DP and
SP4 thymocytes, we theorize that radiation, especially at high dose, may disturb cell
cycle and aﬀect cell renewal and diﬀerentiation.
Identiﬁcation of radiation-induced pathways related to glucocorticoid receptor ablation
experiment in GEO
Glucocorticoid (GC) is a type of steroid hormone, involved in lung maturation and
used as treatment for cancers and cardiovascular diseases.
GC causes its eﬀect
through binding to the Glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In GSE30143, murine GR-
ablated mesenchymal cells were investigated to recapitulate GR activities. The gene
expression proﬁle was obtained for mutants and controls at both embryonic day 16.5
(E16.5) and day 18.5 (E18.5), a progression period during murine lung development
(Habermehl et al., 2011). Our model identiﬁes several factors associated with both
this data set and the radiation sets. Examples include Biocarta Acute Myocardial
Infarction (AMI) pathway (factor 10), gene set targeted by ATM (Ataxia Telangiec-
tasia Mutated gene) regulation (Rashi-Elkeles et al., 2005) (factor 149) and genes
expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5 in HSC (Schuringa et al., 2004)
(factor 178).
These pathways are signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially regulated in controls
from E16.5 ∼E18.5 with a P value <0.0001 (t test), which is consistent with the
68

original experiment.
The transition phase from E16.5 to E18.5 coincides with increased pulmonary
GR expression (Habermehl et al., 2011), which is reﬂected in our results that factor
10 and 178 are up-regulated in E18.5 while down-regulated in E16.5 (Figure 4.11(a)
and 4.11(b)). GR over-expression has an aggravation eﬀect during rats’ myocardial
infarction (Mihailidou et al., 2009). The disease risk greatly increases while exposed
with irradiation, the hazard of which is believed to potentiate the negative eﬀects
on pathogenesis of AMI (Karpov et al., 2012). Because genes in this pathway react
to both radiation exposure and GR-ablation, we hypothesize that the increased risk
of AMI post radiation exposure could be related to GR activation. We also identify
from factor 149 that a gene encoding serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase, SGK1, is
activated at E18.5 while repressed at E16.5 (Figure 4.11(c)). In contrast, the Human
papillomaviruses (HPV) positive cervical cancer gene signatures (Pyeon et al., 2007)
(factor 146) is associated with GR in a reversed expression pattern (Figure 4.11(d)).
GR is often used for cervical cancer treatment as an inhibitor of radiotherapy-induced
apoptosis (Buxant et al., 2009).
4.4.3
Comparison with existing approaches
To further examine the performance of our model, we compare the pathway selec-
tion results obtained from our model with the results generated using GSEA and
GSVA. These are two gene-set-enrichment-score-based methods evaluating (1) path-
way activities between two biological states if the phenotypic information is available
(GSEA), or (2) evaluating pathway variances across samples without the use of a
phenotype (GSVA) (Subramanian et al., 2005; Hanzelmann et al., 2013). We also
compare to DAVID, an online bioinformatics resource providing functional anno-
tation of large lists of genes derived from diﬀerent genomic studies (Dennis et al.,
2003). As in our approach, all these algorithms use public knowledgebases of a priori
69

deﬁned gene sets or pathways.
Since none of the three methods provide integrated analysis, we use only one
radiation batch (244 samples) for comparison. We keep all the data as original (455
samples) for our Bayesian joint factor model. We utilize a pathway knowledgebase
constructed using KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), because all
these analyses have their own gene signature resources, but KEGG is used by all. We
ﬁlter the KEGG mouse pathways to include gene sets containing 10 to 500 genes, and
eliminate KEGG genes which do not have an Aﬀy probe ID. A total of 211 KEGG
pathways are used with 8035 probes belonging to mice Aﬀymetrix 430A 2.0 array.
We next use these probes to initiate DAVID queries, and create zero versus non-zero
radiation dosimetry as binary phenotypic label for GSEA and GSVA.
Figure 4.12 exhibits numbers of pathways identiﬁed by each method. Our model
selects 26 pathways based on posterior estimation, GSEA ﬁnds 21 gene sets en-
riched at FDR q-value<0.25, while DAVID identiﬁes 103 signiﬁcantly enriched gene
sets with Fisher Exact p-value<0.05. We set an adjusted p-value<0.05 for GSVA
enrichment scores, which leads to 141 pathways diﬀerentially activated between non-
irradiation and irradiated groups. Since the experiment was designed to measure re-
covery from radiation exposure using peripheral blood samples, we expect to detect
hematopoiesis related signaling pathways. Some of these pathways may be dysregu-
lated due to radiation damage, and others activated as a recovery response. Among
the 26 pathways our model identiﬁes, 5 represent pathways known to be associated
with radiation exposure.
Examples include MAPK (Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase) signaling pathway,
which was shown to be activated by ionizing radiation or other cellular stresses,
and in turn regulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction and diﬀerentiation
(Chung and Kondo, 2011). This is consistent with what DAVID ﬁnds (ranked in the
2nd place, Bonferroni adjusted p-val=4.49E-17), and is undiscovered by GSEA and
70

GSVA.
Another well-known example, the Wnt signaling pathway, is also identiﬁed by
our model as well as top selected by DAVID (ranked in the 4nd place, Bonferroni
adjusted p-val=2.96E-09) but not by GSEA or GSVA. Wnt pathway is involved in
the maintenance of normal HSC functions, with wnt protein localized in the blood
cells regulating proliferation, diﬀerentiation and survival of HSC (Wilusz and Majka,
2008). Our model also identiﬁes two important genes in this pathway based on their
loadings, WNT2 and GSK3B, respectively. The former is a negative regulator for
hematopoiesis, and the latter involved in the maintenance of HSC function (Huang
et al., 2009b; Wilusz and Majka, 2008). Radiation exposure is likely to ablate rapidly
cycling cells and induce loss of blood cells. In response to such injury, HSC activate
intracellular signals to initiate proliferation that ultimately leads to hematopoiesis.
During HSC regeneration, Wnt pathway is activated to enhance HSC regrowth. It
has been shown that modulating Wnt pathway may be an eﬀective therapeutic strat-
egy to accelerate recovery after injury (Congdon et al., 2008).
A third example, the hedgehog signaling pathway, is activated to induce cycling
and expansion of primitive HSC during acute regeneration. This contributes to the
maintenance of the integrity of the system (Trowbridge et al., 2006). It is again
recovered by our model as well as ranked 22nd in DAVID (Bonferroni adjusted p-
val=1.19E-03), but not shown in GSEA and GSVA.
We uncover up-regulated PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) path-
way and a cell death related pathway-natural killer cell mediated by cytotoxicity-with
p-val at 6.36E-05 and 1.20E-06, respectively, based on comparison of factor scores be-
tween irradiated and base-line samples. They are less signiﬁcant in DAVID (PPAR:
Bonferroni adjusted p-val=0.441; natural killer cell mediated by cytotoxicity: Bon-
ferroni adjusted p-val=0.560), and GSEA and GSVA failed to identify either. The
factor model ﬁnds three unique pathways that are not detected by other methods,
71

including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, protein digestion and absorp-
tion and drug metabolism, which suggests a potential function during hematopoietic
repair after radiation stimulation.
Two moderately signiﬁcant pathways (p-val<0.05) identiﬁed by DAVID and GSVA
are not covered by factor model or GSEA (shown in Figure 4.13).The two examples
are (1) Jak/STAT signaling pathway which is involved in suppression of HSC survival,
induction of apoptosis and inhibition of leukemic growth, and (2) VEGF (vascular
endothelia growth factor), which participates in the formation of blood cells and
controls HSC survival and repopulation (McCubrey et al., 2008; Gerber and Fer-
rara, 2003). GSEA and GSVA both uncover several DNA repair related pathways,
such as mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, non-
homologous end-joining and notch signaling pathway. Ionizing radiation does induce
DNA damage, leading to activation of the DNA repair pathways. However, only
two genes in these pathways show diﬀerential expression greater than two-fold be-
tween non-irradiated and irradiated samples, as indicated in Figure 4.14. These are
CTBP2 (fold-change: 2.7327, p-val: 1.93E-14) and APH1A (fold-change: 2.0179,
p-val: 6.41E-15), both in the NOTCH signaling pathway. This pathway is believed
to exert multiple important functions in the hematopoietic system, ranging from
supporting the ﬁrst deﬁnitive hematopoiesis during fetal life, all the way to main-
taining the HSC in the adult bone marrow and regulating diﬀerentiation of matured
hematopoietic cells in the immune system (Sandy et al., 2012).
There are only three common pathways uncovered by all methods, including DNA
replication, Spliceosome and Ribosome. These pathways are involved in DNA dupli-
cations, post-transcription splicing and translations, respectively, which are related
to cell proliferations, and thus aid hematopoietic system recovery after radiation
damage.

4.5
Conclusions
We have presented a hierarchical model that can identify similar pathway-level gene
co-expression patterns across diverse experimental states, and uncover pathway in-
duction/repression for each dataset. This method provides an unsupervised frame-
work for pathway selection and data integration without the use of explicit pheno-
typic comparisons. Our approach allows the incorporation of a priori information
on gene-pathway association, which enhances interpretability for each factor. Com-
pared with existing gene-set annotation approaches, our model is based on observed
co-regulation across potentially many data sets; Based on comparison studies our
approach is somewhat synergistic with other published approaches. Posterior pa-
rameters obtained from the model as a summary of the overall pathway activities
can be applied for classiﬁcation, survival regression and clustering. Finally, the ra-
diation example demonstrates a successful application of our model. We expect that
the joint Bayesian factor model will be a broadly applicable approach to leveraging
the growing body of available transcriptional proﬁles and generate hypotheses in a
gene expression data-driven, pathway centric manner.

26 gene sets that
changed their expression are grouped into four clusters based on their factor scores.
Each cluster is labeled with a diﬀerent color. From bottom to top, magenta repre-
sents cluster 1 with ﬁve sets, cyan is cluster 2 containing eleven sets, blue for cluster
3 with two sets and cluster 4 (green) includes eight leaves.
Gene set names are
marked on the y-axis, each described as a cell type that diﬀerent genetic or chemical
perturbations triggers a distinct expression. The x-axis represents the height of each
U-shaped line, which is the distance between two data points being connected. A
smaller value means a closer link.

Concluding Remarks and Future Directions
5.1
Summary
This dissertation presents novel methodologies using regulatory modules derived from
genome-wide gene expression proﬁles as a media, which thereby integrate diﬀerent
types of genomic data and provide alternative ways of hypothesis generation. The
major contribution is the development of several innovative Bayesian statistical mod-
els and computational methods for the co-expression-module-centric problems arising
in pathway annotation, cancer, and other diseases. Application of these models is
demonstrated in a series of examples and studies, including deciphering the root cause
of ovarian cancer from genetic and epigenetic perspectives, and identifying pathway
responsive patterns in mice hematopoietic system after ionizing radiation exposure.
The work combines advanced statistical models and computational techniques with
successful applications in various biological systems. Although developed and dis-
cussed in the context of mostly cancer research, these statistical models are broadly
applicable to any other biological studies based on genome-wide gene expression data
and extendable to model other high-dimensional ’Omics’ data.
90

The meta-analysis models developed in this dissertation are used to identify co-
regulatory modules in diﬀerent circumstances: i) Vertical integrative analysis com-
bines multi-omics data of the same patient cohort to investigate driver genes and
regulatory networks, even if these driver mutations exist only in a subgroup of sam-
ples. ii) Horizontal integration approach combines multiple same-type genomic data
(e.g., gene expression) and pathway knowledge base to identify enriched gene sets un-
der diﬀerent biological states with increased statistical power. These models can be
applied separately to address the above three problems, or used together to achieve
’personalized medicine’. Considering the example of TCGA, we ﬁrst perform ver-
tical integration to identify driver mutations underlying a speciﬁc cancer subtype.
We then provide functional annotations for the above genes using the horizontal ap-
proach. This method also enables simultaneous comparison with other patients’ gene
expression data from the same cancer subcategory, which helps to validate the co-
regulatory modules in additional samples. It is also possible to combine data from
other cancer types to discover the same origins of disease among diﬀerent tumor
tissues.

Future directions
The accumulation of ’Omics’ data provides unique opportunities to uncover subtle
distinctions in complex disease phenotypes. While we mainly focus on gene expres-
sion, CNV and methylation, there are other types of data (e.g., exon and protein
expressions, and somatic mutations in TCGA) that has not been covered yet. There-
fore, the next step in this area of research is to continue to incorporate additional
sources of ’Omics’ information into our models, where further adjustment of these
methods is needed.

5.2.1
Jointly modeling mRNA and microRNA expression
Chapters 2 and 3 uncover underlying mechanisms of cancer by tracing changes in
mRNA expression back to its genetic/epigenetic cause. We identiﬁed several novel
genes and regions that might be driver mutations in ovarian cancer. Similarly, an-
other upstream event, microRNA (miRNA), acting as a post-transcriptional regula-
tor for mRNA, can also be incorporated into the same model.
MiRNAs are a class of endogenous, small and highly conserved noncoding RNAs
that regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences on target
mRNA, and inﬂuencing mRNA through translational repression or target degra-
dation (Tseng et al., 2011). MiRNAs are believed to play an important role in the
development of various cellular processes, such as cancer (Qin, 2008). Dysregulated
miRNA expression is characterized in many diﬀerent cancer types, including carci-
nomas of the breast, ovary and lung (Eder and Scherr, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006;
Creighton et al., 2010). As large-scale expression proﬁling of miRNA becomes avail-
able, we could integrate miRNA with mRNA, which is likely to provide an additional
clue towards unveiling the mechanisms of tumorogenesis.
In order to identify miRNA-mRNA comodules, we need to take into account the
following aspects: i) Anti-correlation between the two data modalities; ii) Grouped
eﬀect: individual miRNAs have only limited impact on their targets and multiple
diﬀerent miRNAs often work in groups to drastically reduce mRNA transcriptions
(Malumbres, 2012); iii) Individual eﬀect: each miRNA could target hundreds of genes
(Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011); iv) Current knowledge of sequence/structure information
(Kertesz et al., 2007; Enright et al., 2003; John et al., 2004; Lewis et al., 2005;
Coronnello and Benos, 2013) could be utilized to predict miRNA targets, via the
prior probability model.
Based on the above information, we could transform the FA model in either
92

chapter 2 or 3 to incorporate miRNA expression data.
In order to capture the
negative association between miRNA and mRNA, we place more constraints on the
model by introducing positively truncated normal priors on loadings and forcing
negative signs on the shared components of miRNA factors. Spike-and-slab prior
will be used on miRNA loadings to introduce sparseness, while a diﬀerent prior can
be placed on the probability parameter ρg,j that controls loadings being non-zero.
ρg,j is forced to be a bernoulli random variable with ρg,j ∼Bernoulli(rg,j); rg,j
is the success rate, indicating the probability of assigning g-th miRNA to the j-th
factor (i.e., non-zero loading) is rg,j. Gene-miRNA association scores obtained from
sequence/structure information are used in a logistic function to sample rg,j with
P(rg,j|µ, sg,j) =
exp(µ+τsg,j)
1+exp(µ+τsg,j), where µ and τ are unknown mean and coeﬃcient, and
sg,j represents the association scores (Stingo et al., 2010).
5.2.2
FA model for data generated from sequencing-based technology
During the past decades, microarrays have been the most important and widely
used approach to characterize the molecular basis of phenotypic variation in biology.
But a recent emergence of high-throughput sequencing technology (next-generation
sequencing) has provided a powerful alternative. It is also used in transcriptional
proﬁling by sequencing cDNA (RNA-seq), and hence generating millions of short
reads. These reads are further mapped to a target region of the reference genome,
and the number of reads linearly reﬂects the abundance of the target transcript
(Mortazavi et al., 2008). RNA-seq oﬀers several advantages over microarray-based
proﬁling, including the ability of detecting and quantifying unknown transcripts and
isoforms, and providing information on alternative splicing and genetic variations.
The RNA-seq data is observed as over-dispersed and repeated counts, which is
very diﬀerent from expression data.
The analysis of RNA-seq data is, however,
very challenging. For example, the read coverage may not be uniformly distributed
93

along the genome because of the variations in nucleotide composition. In addition,
cDNA library sizes or sequencing depths vary among diﬀerent samples, therefore,
it may not be appropriate to directly compare the read counts between samples.
Besides, highly expressed genes tend to contribute to a large part of the sequenced
reads, which thereby represses the counts of all other genes (Wesolowski et al., 2013).
Traditional methods for measuring diﬀerential expression in microarray data are
not immediately transferable to analyze RNA-seq data. Several methods have been
developed to tackle these problems (Li and Tibshirani, 2013; Tarazona et al., 2011;
Leng et al., 2012; Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010; Auer and Doerge, 2011; Di et al., 2011;
Robinson et al., 2010; Anders and Huber, 2010). There are also growing interests in
adjusting our FA model for it, which can be added into the joint FA framework and
complete an integrated analysis.
The straightforward way seems to use the Poisson distribution and a log link, and
factorize the link function afterwards. However, this single-parameter distribution
constrains the variance to be equal to the mean, which may not be well-suited to
model the high variability in biological replicates. Placing a gamma prior on the
mean of the Poisson distribution produces a negative-binomial distribution (a.k.a,
gamma-Poisson), which is a better way to address the over-dispersion problem by
introducing two parameters, i.e., number of successes and the success probability. It
seems reasonable to factorize count matrix using this gamma-Poisson type of prior.
Zhou et al. (2012) proposed a Poisson Factor Analysis approach (PFA), and extended
it to a beta-gamma-gamma-Poisson hierarchical structure (βγΓ-PFA) that assigns
Dirichlet prior to factor loadings and gamma prior to factor scores. This model is
easily extendable to reﬂect non-negative matrix factorization (Lee and Seung, 2000)
and latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), which are popular approaches to
model discrete data. Therefore, adjusting the βγΓ-PFA prior for RNA-seq data is
another future direction for biological exploration.
