Wigner Distribution
R.F. O’Connell
In contrast to classical physics, the language of quantum mechanics involves
 operators and  wave functions (or, more generally,  density operators). How-
ever, in1932, Wigner formulated quantum mechanics in terms of a distribution
function W(q, p), the marginals of which yield the correct quantum probabilities
for q and p separately [1]. Its usefulness stems from the fact that it provides a
re-expression of quantum mechanics in terms of classical concepts so that quantum

mechanical expectation values are now expressed as averages over phase-space
distribution functions. In other words, statistical information is transferred from
the density operator to a quasi-classical (distribution) function. Wigner [1] pre-
sented a speciﬁc form for W(p, q), while recognizing that other possibilities exist,
depending on the conditions which are imposed on W. Wigner’s choice has the
virtue of mathematical simplicity but it has the feature that it may take negative
values, with the result that several authors have investigated non-negative distribu-
tion functions. However, we regard negative values of W as a manifestation of its
quantum nature and the fact that it “... cannot be really interpreted as the simul-
taneous probability for coordinates and momenta...” [1] Wigner’s original paper
was concerned with using W for the speciﬁc purpose of calculating the quantum
correction for thermodynamic equilibrium. The recognition of its more general
applicability stems mainly from the work of Groenewold [2] and Moyal [3], who
investigated the correspondence between physical quantities and quantum operators
and showed, in particular, that the correspondence is not unique and moreover, that
the distribution functions obtained by the Weyl correspondence [4] are the Wigner
functions. Moyal also showed how the time dependence of W and other such
functions (– which arise from alternative association rules other than Wigner-Weyl
but which lead to the same physical results) may be determined without using the
 Schr¨odinger equation. In fact, Moyal’s paper was a landmark contribution as,
in essence, “...it establishes an independent formulation of quantum mechanics in
phase space” [5]. As for all quantum formulations, Ballentine [6] has shown that
the development of the classical limit of the Wigner distribution is a subtle process,
especially in view of the fact that, in general, W(q, p) has negative parts. Turning
to speciﬁcs, we present some basic results developed in the original pioneering
papers [1–4, 28] but conveniently presented in a comprehensive review by Hillery
et al. [7]. Thus, in one-dimensional space (generalization to n dimensions being
straightforward), for a  mixed state represented by a density matrix ˆρ,
W(q, p) = 1
πℏ
 ∞
−∞
dy⟨q −y| ˆρ|q + y⟩e2ipy/ℏ,
(1)
whereas, for a pure state ( states, pure and mixed) represented by a wave function
ψ(q),
W(q, p) = 1
πℏ
 ∞
−∞
dyψ∗(q + y)ψ(q −y)e2ipy/ℏ.
(2)
However, in order to calculate correct expectation values and ensemble averages
( ensembles in quantum mechanics), it is also necessary to specify the classical
function A(q, p) corresponding to a quantum operator ˆA as
A(q, p) =

dz eipz/ℏ⟨q −1
2z| ˆA|q + 1
2z⟩,

so that

 
dq dp A(q, p) = 2πℏTr( ˆA). This ensures that

dq

dp A(q, p)B(q, p) = (2πℏ) Tr( ˆA ˆB),
(4)
and

dq

dp A(q, p)W(q, p) = Tr( ˆρ ˆA(ˆq, ˆp)),
(5)
so that, in particular, we see that W(q, p) derived from the density matrix, is
(2πℏ)−1 times the phase space operator which corresponds to the same matrix. Fol-
lowing these original papers, [1–4,28] there were many papers devoted to extending
the framework and overall understanding of distribution functions. In addition, dis-
tributions other than those of Wigner were introduced, notable those of Kirkwood,
Cahill and Glauber, Glauber, Sudarshan and Husimi (all of which are reviewed
in [8], where it is noted that some of these are everywhere non-negative) and
Cohen [9] and all require classical functions different from that given in (3) in
order to ensure consistency. It is clear that all distribution functions are not mea-
surable, despite some claims to the contrary in the literature, where in fact what
is observed are the marginal q probabilities from which values of W(q, p) are in-
ferred but one could equally have inferred values for other distribution functions.
The earliest applications of the Wigner function were in the arena of statistical
mechanics but, more recently, among the diverse areas in which theW function
was found to be useful we mention hydrodynamics [10], plasmas [11], quantum
corrections for transport coefﬁcients [12], collision theory [13] and signal analy-
sis [14]. However, we feel that the overwhelming majority of applications are to
be found in quantum systems where ﬂuctuations and dissipation are playing an
important role. In this context, the 1984 review of the W function by Hillery et
al. [7] made extensive reference to its relevance in quantum optics, which is un-
derlined by the more recent books of Scully and Zubairy [15] and Schleich [16].
Complementary to this work is the application of the W function to a variety of
problems in quantum statistical mechanics, where effects associated with the anal-
ysis of quantum systems in a heat bath (including the radiation ﬁeld heat bath)
are of the essence. As examples of the usefulness of the W function in this con-
text we note its role in obtaining the simplest approach to solving the initial value
quantum Langevin equation and, concomitantly, the solution to an exact master
equation [17] and also its role in the investigation of  Schr¨odinger cat superposi-
tions [18]. However there are limitations to the usefulness of the W function (some
of which were discussed by Moyal [3]), notably for particles with  spin and for rel-
ativistic particles. Finally, we mention the excellent and comprehensive overview of
selected papers on quantum mechanics in phase space, with emphasis on the Wigner
function [5].
