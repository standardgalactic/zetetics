Preface
The material in this book is derived from an intensive course in X-ray
structure analysis organized on behalf of the Chemical Crystallogra-
phy Group of the British Crystallographic Association and held every
two years since 1987. As with a crystal structure derived from X-ray
diffraction data, the course contents have been gradually reﬁned over
the years and they reached a stage in 1999 (the seventh course) where
we considered they could be published, and hence made available to a
far wider audience than can be accommodated on the course itself. The
result was the ﬁrst edition of this book, published in 2001. The authors
were the principal lecturers on the course in 1999 and they revised
and expanded the material, while converting the lecture notes into a
book format. Because of its origin, the book represented a snapshot of
the intensive course, which has continued to evolve, especially as the
subject of chemical crystallography has undergone signiﬁcant changes,
mainly due to the widespread availability of area detector technology,
the exponential increase in computing power and improvements in soft-
ware, and greater use of synchrotron radiation and powder diffraction.
Nevertheless, the underlying principles remain valid, and the particular
application of those principles can be adapted to new developments for
some time to come.
By the time of the eleventh course in 2007, its contents and the team
of principal lecturers had changed markedly, and we were asked to con-
sider a second edition of the book reﬂecting these developments. This
has been encouraged and assisted by the use of a consistent template for
the 2007 course notes, and these have been used as the basis for this new
edition. Nevertheless, any readers who participated in the 2007 course
will detect a number of changes, particularly in the inclusion of some
material not covered in the lecture notes, some updating, and differences
of style made necessary by a non-interactive format.
Since this book, like its ﬁrst edition, owes its origins to the course, we
acknowledge here our large debt to those who have dedicated much
effort to the organization of the course since its inception; without them
thisbookwouldneverhaveexisted,evenasanidea.Theﬁrstﬁvecourses
were held at the University of Aston, where the local organizers Phil
Lowe and Carl Schwalbe set a gold standard of course administration
and smooth operation, establishing many of the enduring characteristics
valued by participants ever since. Following the move to the Univer-
sity of Durham, Vanessa Hoy and then Claire Wilson developed these
ﬁrm foundations to even further heights of excellence, presenting a

challenge toAndres Goeta, who took over for the 2009 Course. Through-
out the course’s history Judith Howard has provided overall guidance
and expertise, particularly in fund raising, and has spared the course
lecturers much concern with the practicalities of maintaining and pro-
moting the course. Several organizations, including the EPSRC, IUCr,
BCA and commercial sponsors, have been long-standing and generous
supporters of the course.
The ﬁrst course in 1987 was the brainchild of David Watkin, who
worked extremely hard to launch it and establish it as the enduring
success that it has become. His role as course director was taken over in
the mid-1990s by Bob Gould, who passed on the baton to Sandy Blake
after 1999; from 2011 the director will be Simon Parsons. The template
for the lecture notes on which this book is based was developed by
Horst Puschmann, and Amber Thompson has looked after assembling
and producing the notes for the last few courses.
Many colleagues have made contributions to the course over the
years, in lectures and in the crucial group tutorial sessions: a book format
can never reﬂect the intensive interaction and lively atmosphere. These
and the social aspects of the course are probably at least as important
in the memories of participants as the formal lecture presentations. One
aspect of the tutorial group sessions of the course has been retained in
modiﬁed form in the book. Most chapters include exercises, for which
answers are provided in an appendix. Readers are encouraged to tackle
the exercises at leisure and not consult the answers until they are satis-
ﬁed with their own efforts. In the spirit of the tutorials, these exercises
may also prove beneﬁcial as a basis for group discussion.
Over the twenty years of the course and its eleven occasions, we have
seen former students return as group tutors, and tutors move on into
lecturer roles. Course participants, from many countries, are established
practising crystallographers in academic and industrial posts around
the world. Courses elsewhere have been developed, modelled on our
experience. We dedicate this book to the hundreds of students who
have been the course’s primary beneﬁciaries and whose hard work and
commitment, intellectually and socially, have contributed much to its
success.

1.1
Introduction
The subsequent chapters in this book will assume some basic knowledge
of crystal-structure determination. As readers will be at very different
levels, we wish to make sure you have available some of the fundamen-
tals of the subject that will be developed in the book. It is not necessary
to understand everything in this introduction before reading further,
but we hope that it will provide helpful reference material for some of
the chapters.
1.2
X-ray scattering from electrons
The scattering of X-rays from electrons is called Thomson scattering. It
occurs because the electron oscillates in the electric ﬁeld of the incoming
X-ray beam and an oscillating electric charge radiates electromagnetic
waves. Thus, X-rays are radiated from the electron at the same frequency
as the primary beam. However, most electrons radiate π radians (180◦)
outofphasewiththeincomingbeam,asshownbyamathematicalmodel
of the process. The motion of an electron is heavily damped when the
X-ray frequency is close to the electron resonance frequency. This occurs
near an absorption edge of the atom, changing the relative phase of the
radiated X-rays to π/2 and giving rise to the phenomenon of anomalous
(resonant) scattering.

X-ray scattering from atoms
There is a path difference between X-rays scattered from different parts
of the same atom, resulting in destructive interference that depends
upon the scattering angle. This reduction in X-rays scattered from an
atom with increasing angle is described by the atomic scattering fac-
tor, illustrated in Fig. 1.1. The value of the scattering factor at zero
scattering angle is equal to the number of electrons in the atom. The
atomic scattering factors illustrated are for stationary atoms, but atoms
are normally subject to thermal vibration. This movement modiﬁes the
scattering factor and must always be taken into account.

2
Introduction to diffraction
If anomalous scattering takes place, the atomic scattering factor is
altered to take this into account. This occurs when the X-ray frequency
is close to the resonance frequency of an electron. Only some of the elec-
trons in the atom are affected and they will scatter the X-rays roughly
π/2 out of phase with the incident beam. Electrons scattering exactly
π/2 out of phase are represented mathematically by an imaginary com-
ponent of the scattering factor and they cease to contribute to the real
part. The exact phase change is very sensitive to the X-ray frequency.
This is shown in Fig. 1.2 that displays the real and imaginary parts of
the contribution to the atomic scattering factor of the anomalously scat-
tering electrons as a function of wavelength. The remaining electrons
in the atom are unaffected by this change in wavelength. Such informa-
tion on atomic scattering factors is obtained from quantum-mechanical
calculations.

1.4
X-ray scattering from a unit cell
X-rays scattered from each atom in the unit cell contribute to the overall
scattering pattern. Since each atom acts as a source of scattered X-rays,
the waves will add constructively or destructively in varying amounts
depending upon the direction of the diffracted beam and the atomic
positions. This gives a complicated diffraction pattern whose amplitude
and phase vary continuously, as can be seen in the two-dimensional
optical analogue in Fig. 1.3.
1.5
The effects of the crystal lattice
The diffraction pattern of the crystal lattice is also a lattice, known as
the reciprocal lattice. The name comes from the reciprocal relationship
between the two lattices – large crystal lattice spacings result in small
spacings in the reciprocal lattice and vice versa. The direct cell parame-
ters are normally represented by a, b, c, α, β, γ and the reciprocal lattice
parameters by a∗, b∗, c∗, α∗, β∗, γ ∗. The direction of a∗is perpendicu-
lar to the directions of b and c and its magnitude is reciprocal to the
Fig. 1.3 Holes in an opaque sheet and their optical diffraction pattern.

spacing of the lattice planes parallel to b and c; similarly for b∗and c∗.
A two-dimensional example of the relationship between the direct and
reciprocal lattices is shown in Fig. 1.4.
1.6
X-ray scattering from the crystal
A combination (convolution) of a single unit cell with the crystal lat-
tice gives the complete crystal. The X-ray diffraction pattern is therefore
given by the product of the scattering from the unit cell and the recip-
rocal lattice, i.e. it is the scattering pattern of a single unit cell observed
only at reciprocal lattice points. This can be seen in Fig. 1.5, which shows
the unit cell of Fig. 1.3 repeated on a lattice and its corresponding diffrac-
tion pattern. The underlying intensity is the same in both patterns. The
positions of the reciprocal lattice points are given by the crystal lattice;
the value of the diffraction pattern at a reciprocal lattice point is given
by the atomic arrangement within the unit cell.

Introduction to diffraction
1.7
The structure-factor equation
There are many factors affecting the intensity of X-rays in the diffraction
pattern. The one that depends only upon the crystal structure is called
the structure factor. It can be expressed in terms of the contents of a
single unit cell as:
F(hkl) =
N

j=1
fj exp

2πi(hxj + kyj + lzj)

.
(1.1)
The position of the jth atom is given by the fractional co-ordinates
(xj, yj, zj), it has a scattering factor of fj and there are N atoms in the
cell. Structure factors are measured in number of electrons; they give a
mathematical description of the diffraction pattern such as that illus-
trated in Fig. 1.6. Each structure factor represents a diffracted beam
that has an amplitude, |F(hkl)|, and a relative phase φ(hkl). Mathemat-
ically, these are combined as |F(hkl)| exp[iφ(hkl)] and can be written as
F(hkl).
You may notice that the distribution of intensities in the diffrac-
tion pattern in Fig. 1.6 is centrosymmetric. This is an illustration of
Friedel’s Law that states that |F(hkl)| = |F(hkl)|. The law follows from
(1.1) that shows that F(hkl) is the complex conjugate of F(hkl), mak-
ing the magnitudes equal and relating the phases as ϕ(hkl) = −ϕ(hkl).
This is no longer true when the atomic scattering factor fj is also com-
plex. Changing the signs of the diffraction indices does not produce
the complex conjugate of fj, so Friedel’s Law is not obeyed when
there is anomalous scattering. However, the effect is phase dependent
and for centrosymmetric structures where all the phases are 0 or π,
the magnitudes of F(hkl) and F(hkl) are always changed by the same
amount.

The electron-density equation

The experimental measurements consist of the intensity of each beam
and its position in the diffraction pattern. After suitable correction fac-
tors are applied, the quantities recorded are h, k, l, |F(hkl)| or h, k, l,
|F(hkl)|2.

The electron-density equation
AnimageofthecrystalstructurecanbecalculatedfromtheX-raydiffrac-
tion pattern. Since it is the electrons that scatter the X-rays, it is the
electrons that we see in the image, giving the value of the electron den-
sity at every point in a single unit cell of the crystal. The units of density
are the number of electrons per cubicAngstrom unit – e/Å3. The electron
density is expressed in terms of the structure factors as:
ρ(xyz) = 1

where the summation is over all the structure factors F(hkl) and V is
the volume of the unit cell. Note that the structure factors include the
phases φ(hkl) and not just the experimentally measured amplitudes
|F(hkl)|. Since the X-rays are diffracted from the whole crystal, the cal-
culation yields the contents of the unit cell averaged over the whole
crystal and not the contents of any individual cell. In addition, because
of the ﬁnite time it takes to perform the diffraction experiment, we see
a time-averaged picture of the electrons. This results in a smeared-
out image of each atom because of its thermal vibration, as seen in
Fig. 1.7.

A mathematical relationship
Notice the mathematical similarity between (1.1) and (1.2). Equation
(1.1) transforms the electron density (in the form of atomic scattering fac-
tors, fj) to the structure factors F(hkl), while (1.2) transforms the structure
factors back to the electron density. These are known as Fourier trans-
forms – one equation performing the inverse transform of the other. This
is a mathematical description of image formation by a lens. Light scat-
tered by an object (Fourier transform) is collected by a lens and focused
into an image (inverse transform). In the optical case, the (real) image
is inverted and this is seen mathematically by the appearance of the
negative sign in the exponent of (1.2).
1.10
Bragg’s law
We cannot go far into X-ray diffraction without mentioning Bragg’s law.
This gives the geometrical conditions under which a diffracted beam can
be observed. Figure 1.8 shows rays diffracted from lattice planes and,
to get constructive interference, the path difference should be a whole
number of wavelengths. This leads to Bragg’s law which is expressed as:
2d sin θ = nλ,
(1.3)
where θ is known as the Bragg angle, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays
and d is the plane spacing. The ﬁgure suggests the rays are reﬂected from
the crystal planes. They are not – it is strictly diffraction – but reﬂection is
mathematically equivalent in this context and the name X-ray reﬂection
has stayed with us since Bragg ﬁrst used it. The value of n in Bragg’s
law can always be taken as unity, since any multiples of the wavelength
can be accounted for in the diffraction indices h, k, l of any particular
reﬂection. For example, n = 2 for the planes h, k, l is equivalent to n = 1
for the planes 2h, 2k, 2l.

Resolution
In X-ray crystallography we have effectively a microscope that gives
images of crystal structures, although its realization is different from an
ordinary optical microscope. What is the resolution of the image and
what is its magniﬁcation? By convention, the resolution is given by the
minimum value of d that appears in Bragg’s law. This will correspond
to the maximum value of θ. With Mo Kα radiation and all data collected
to a maximum θ of 25◦, Bragg’s law gives:

producing a resolution (dmin) of 0.84 Å. The maximum possible reso-
lution is λ/2, which occurs when sin(θmax) = 1. For Cu Kα radiation
this will be 0.77 Å, similar to the resolution obtained with Mo Kα for
θmax =
25◦. Figure 1.9 shows the effect on the electron density of
imposing different limits on the extent of the diffraction pattern used to
produce it.
If an electron density map is displayed on a scale of 1 cm/Å, this
corresponds to a magniﬁcation of 108. You should be impressed by this
very large number.
1.12
The phase problem
The measured X-ray intensities yield only the structure-factor ampli-
tudes and not their phases. The calculation of the electron density can
not therefore be performed directly from experimental measurements
and the phases must be obtained by other means. Hence, the so-called
phase problem. Methods of overcoming the phase problem include:
(i) Patterson search and interpretation techniques,
(ii) direct methods,
(iii) use of anomalous dispersion,
(iv) isomorphous replacement,
(v) molecular replacement.
Methods (i) and (ii) are the most important in small-molecule crystal-
lography; the others feature in macromolecular crystallography.

2.1
The relationship between a crystal
structure and its diffraction pattern
A crystal structure and its diffraction pattern are related to each other,
in both directions, by the mathematical procedure of Fourier transfor-
mation, the details of which are considered elsewhere. The diffraction
pattern is the Fourier transform of the crystal structure, corresponding
to the pattern of waves scattered from an incident X-ray beam by a single
crystal; it can be measured by experiment (only partially, because the
amplitudes are obtainable from the directly measured intensities via a
number of corrections, but the relative phases of the scattered waves are
lost), and it can be calculated (giving both amplitudes and phases) for a
known structure. In turn, the crystal structure is the Fourier transform of
the diffraction pattern and is expressed in terms of the electron-density
distribution concentrated in atoms; it can not be measured by direct
experiment, because the scattered X-rays can not be refracted by lenses
to form an image as is done with light in an optical microscope, and it
can not be obtained directly by calculation, because the required relative
phases of the waves are unknown.
Part of an X-ray diffraction pattern of a single crystal is shown, as
a computer-generated reproduction, in Fig. 2.1. It consists of a pattern
of discrete spots with a range of intensities (represented as different
sizes of spot). This pattern has a deﬁnite geometry, and a degree of
symmetry in the positions and intensities of the individual spots, in
this case a combination of horizontal and vertical reﬂection (with an
inversion point at the centre of the pattern), so that only one quarter of
the pattern is unique, the other three quarters being symmetry related
to it. The full diffraction pattern, of course, is three-dimensional; only
part of a section through it is shown here.
The geometry of the pattern can be described by measuring the
distances between spots and angles between rows of spots. In this exam-
ple, the pattern is rectangular, with perpendicular rows, and this is a

necessary consequence of the reﬂection symmetry present; the horizon-
tal and vertical spacings are different.
Measurement of the geometry of a diffraction pattern gives informa-
tion about the regular arrangement of molecules in the crystal structure.
The symmetry of the pattern is related to the symmetry of the solid-state
arrangement of molecules. The intensities, among which there is no
obvious relationship except for the symmetry, hold information about
the actual shapes and orientations of molecules, i.e. the positions of
atoms in the crystal structure. The biggest task in determining a crys-
tal structure is measuring these (usually thousands of) intensities and
extracting the details of the atomic arrangement from them, but this can
not be done without an understanding of the geometry and symmetry
relationships as well. Here, we concentrate on symmetry aspects.
2.2
Translation symmetry in
crystalline solids
Chemists are most familiar with symmetry in its application to individ-
ual molecules, as expressed in their point groups, particularly through
aspects of group theory in bonding and spectroscopy. Symmetry plays a
very important part in crystallography, and its application to crystalline
solids includes concepts additional to those for isolated molecules.
A perfectly crystalline solid material consists of a very large (effec-
tively inﬁnite) number of identical molecules (or assemblies of a few
molecules) arranged in a precisely regular way repeated in all direc-
tions, to give a high degree of order (theoretically zero entropy). This
repetition in a regular pattern of an individual structural unit, in an iden-
tical form and orientation, is a form of symmetry, called translation, and
it is the most fundamental characteristic of the crystalline solid state.

2.2
Translation symmetry in crystalline solids
11
All perfect crystals display translation symmetry in three dimensions,
whether or not any other symmetry elements (rotation, reﬂection and
inversion)arealsopresent;theyareoptional,buttranslationisnecessary.
The two-dimensional manifestation of translation symmetry is familiar
in the form of patterns on clothing and other materials, wallpaper, etc.
A complete crystal structure can be speciﬁed by describing the con-
tents of one repeat unit, together with the way in which this unit is
repeated by translation symmetry. The translation symmetry is deﬁned
by the lattice of the structure and given numerical expression in the
parameters of a unit cell; here are two terms of vital importance in
crystallography.
In order to obtain the lattice of a particular crystal structure, choose
any single point in any repeat unit of the structure (for example, one
atom), and mark it with a dot. Find all the other points in the struc-
ture that are identical to this one (i.e. with identical surroundings, in
exactly the same orientation) and mark them also. Now keep the dots
and remove the structure. What remains is just a regular inﬁnite array
of points in three dimensions. This is the lattice; all the points are iden-
tical, equivalent to each other by translation symmetry. The operation
of translation is that of moving from one point to any equivalent one.
The lattice shows the repeating nature of the structure but not the actual
form (contents) of the structural repeat unit. Starting with a different
point and repeating the whole process would give exactly the same
result, and it is not necessary to choose the lattice points to lie on atoms
(in the majority of real crystal structures they do not, because there are
conventions that put them by preference on symmetry elements that lie
between molecules and relate them to each other; more on this later).

Fig. 2.2 A unit cell.
Any translation from one lattice point to another can be represented
as a vector, because it has a deﬁnite length and a certain direction. All
such vectors, for an arbitrary choice of any two lattice points, can be
constructed by putting together multiples of three basic unit vectors that
are the shortest three non-coplanar vectors between pairs of adjacent
lattice points:
t = ua + vb + wc,
where a, b, c are the unit vectors for this lattice, and u, v, w are integers
(positive, zero, and negative values are allowed). The complete lattice
geometry can thus be deﬁned by the three base vectors. In order to
do this with pure numbers rather than vectors, it is necessary to give
the lengths of the three vectors and the angles between each pair of
them (three angles altogether). By standard convention, the three vector
lengths are called a, b, and c, and the angles are called α, β, and γ ; α is
the angle between b and c, β is the angle between c and a, and γ is the
angle between a and b. These three vectors and 9 others equivalent to
them enclose a shape that is the three-dimensional equivalent of a two-
dimensional parallelogram (called a parallelepiped), similar to a brick
but not generally with 90◦angles. This shape is called the unit cell of
the crystal structure (and of its lattice); see Fig. 2.2. One unit cell is thus

12
Introduction to symmetry and diffraction
the basic building block of the whole structure, which can be regarded
as being assembled by placing identical copies of the unit cell together
to ﬁll space. Each unit cell contains the equivalent of one lattice point
(there are lattice points at all eight corners, but each is shared by the
eight unit cells that meet there). The three basic vectors are the three
different edges of the parallelepiped, and are also called the unit cell
edges. Their three lengths and the three angles are often referred to as
either unit cell parameters or lattice parameters; these two terms are
interchangeable and equivalent.
For any given lattice, many different choices of unit cell are possi-
ble, but there is always at least one for which the cell edges are the
three shortest non-coplanar vectors of the lattice, and this is preferred
by convention; it is called the reduced cell. (Actually, there are differ-
ent deﬁnitions of the term ‘reduced cell’, of which this is a particular
one that is probably most widely used and most clearly deﬁned; its full
name is the Niggli reduced cell. For completeness of the deﬁnition, the
base vector directions are chosen to make all three cell angles <90◦or
all three ≥90◦, and the axes are ordered in length, a ≤b ≤c.)
In the absence of any rotation or reﬂection symmetry in the crystal
structure, the three unit cell axes are normally of different lengths and
the three angles differ from each other and from special values such as
90◦, although close approximation to equality or to such values may
fortuitously be found sometimes.
It is the translation symmetry of crystalline materials that gives rise to
X-ray diffraction. Any regularly spaced arrangement of objects can act
as a diffraction grating for waves having a wavelength comparable to
the repeat distance(s) between the identical objects. Thus, regularly and
closely spaced parallel lines give a one-dimensional diffraction grating
for infra-red and visible light in spectrometers, enabling the separa-
tion of different wavelengths, and a diffraction effect can be observed

crystals are comparable to the wavelengths of X-rays (and of electrons
and neutrons moving at appropriate velocities), so crystals act as three-
dimensional diffraction gratings. The basic mathematical relationships
are given in the introductory chapter (Chapter 1) and in the chapter on
data-collection theory (Chapter 5).
2.3
Symmetry of individual molecules, with
relevance to crystalline solids
In applying point group symmetry to molecules, chemists learn about
two basic types of symmetry operations and symmetry elements, and
these include some particularly common examples that are treated spe-
cially. Crystallographers use the same symmetry operations (they are
fundamentalpropertiesofnature!),butdetaileddeﬁnitionsandnotation
are different; this is unfortunate but is for good reasons.

2.3
Symmetry of individual molecules, with relevance to crystalline solids
13
A symmetry element is a physically identiﬁable point, line, or plane
in a molecule (or any other individual object) about which symmetry
operations are applied; a symmetry operation is an inversion through
such a point, a rotation about a line, or a reﬂection in a plane, that leaves
the molecule afterwards with an identical appearance. Each symmetry
element thus provides a number of possible symmetry operations (for
example, a rotation axis gives rise to rotations by any multiple of its
basic minimum angle: rotations of 120◦, 240◦and 360◦are all valid sym-
metry operations associated with a three-fold rotation axis; the last of
these is equivalent to the identity operation, i.e. not doing anything at
all, and we have just seen a similar situation for translation symmetry,
where any lattice translation can be regarded as a combination of multi-
ples of the three fundamental lattice translations for a particular crystal
structure).
For individual molecules, all symmetry operations can be classiﬁed
as one of two types: proper rotations (rotations by a certain fraction of
360◦about a rotation axis), and improper rotations (the combination
of a rotation and a simultaneous reﬂection in a plane perpendicular
to the axis and passing through the centre of the molecule); this is the
deﬁnition (known as the Schoenﬂies convention) used by chemists for
spectroscopyandbondingapplications.Becauseoftheparticularimpor-
tance of the inversion centre in crystallographic symmetry (see later), we
use a different convention, called the Hermann–Maugin or international
convention, where an improper (or inversion) axis is the combination of
a rotation and a simultaneous inversion through a point at the cen-
tre of the molecule. For the operations that can occur in crystalline
solids, the correspondence between the two conventions is shown in
Table 2.1, together with the conventional symbols. Note that inversion
and reﬂection operations are just special cases of improper rotations. All
improper operations involve a change of hand (a left hand is reﬂected

or inverted into a right hand), while proper rotations retain the same
handedness; this has important implications for the crystal structures of
chiral molecules as well as the molecules themselves.
Symmetry elements can be combined only in certain ways that are
consistent with each other. For a single molecule, all symmetry ele-
ments present must pass through a common point at the centre of the
molecule; if there is an inversion centre, there can be only one and it
is at this point. For this reason, the total collection of all the symmetry
operations for a molecule is called its point group, and each point group
has its own characteristic properties and a conventional symbol (again,
different symbols are used by spectroscopists and by crystallographers).
In principle, any order of rotation axis (the number of individual min-
imum rotation operations that must be repeated in order to achieve a
total of 360◦rotation) is possible within a molecule, although high-order
rotations are rare, and two-fold rotation (C2) is the most common. By
contrast, the combination of other symmetry with translation in the crys-
talline state puts restrictions on the types of symmetry operation that
are possible, because some orders of rotation are incompatible with the
repeat nature of a lattice. Thus, the only orders possible in crystalline
solids are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, for both proper and improper rotations. This
does not mean that molecules with other symmetry elements can not
crystallise! However, such symmetry elements can not apply to the sur-
roundings of the molecules in the crystal, i.e. to the crystal structure as
a whole; atoms that are symmetry-equivalent in an isolated molecule,
such as all 10 carbon atoms of ferrocene, have different environments
in a crystal and are no longer fully equivalent (they would give differ-
ent solid-state 13C NMR signals, for example). Because of this restriction,
there are only 32 point groups that are relevant to crystallography; these
are discussed later.
All three-dimensional lattices have inversion symmetry, whether or
not the individual unit cell contents are centrosymmetric, and so the
presence of inversion symmetry in a crystal structure does not put
any restrictions on unit cell parameters; they can still adopt any arbi-
trary values that give a sensible overall packing of the molecules. Any
rotation or reﬂection symmetry in the solid state, however, imposes
restrictions and special values on the unit cell parameters. For exam-
ple, four-fold rotation symmetry means that the unit cell must have two
square faces exactly opposite each other with an axis perpendicular to
them both (parallel to the rotation axis), so two of the cell axes are equal
in length and all three angles are 90◦. On the basis of these restrictions,
crystal symmetry is broadly divided into seven types, called the seven
crystal systems. Table 2.2 shows their names, the minimum symmetry
characteristicofeachone,andtherestrictionsontheunitcellparameters.
For some crystal structures with rotation and/or reﬂection symmetry,
it is convenient and conventional to choose a unit cell containing more
than one lattice point. For example, take an orthorhombic structure, for
which each of the three unit cell axes is associated with either a two-
fold rotation along the axis, a reﬂection perpendicular to it, or both of

rotation or a screw axis, and mirrors can also be glide planes. The centred cell types shown in parentheses can be converted into standard
types not in parentheses by a different choice of axes, but are used in some cases in order to satisfy other conventions or conveniences
regarding symmetry and geometry.

these; the unit cell is a rectangular parallelepiped with all axes mutually
perpendicular, like a standard building brick; the 90◦cell angles are a
necessary consequence of the rotation/reﬂection symmetry and so are
an indicator that such symmetry is probably present in the structure.
Now consider a similar structure in which there is a lattice point added
at the centre of the unit cell. Since lattice points are all equivalent by
deﬁnition, this means the point at the centre of each unit cell is entirely
equivalent to the points at the cell corners. Remember that the unit cell
is just a convenient way of joining up lattice points to indicate the geom-
etry; the lattice is a fundamental property of the structure, but the unit
cell is an arbitrary deﬁnition. It would be possible to choose a smaller
unit cell, since the distance from one corner to the centre of the cell is
shorter than the longest of the three original unit cell axes. This cell
would have half the volume of the original cell and there would be one
lattice point per unit cell overall. It would, however, have some strange
cell angles and the convenience of the 90◦angles and rectangular cell
shape are lost. In such cases, the larger unit cell with more than one
lattice point is usually chosen by convention, so that the geometrical
properties in Table 2.2 still apply. Unit cells with one lattice point are
referred to as primitive (P), and those with more than one lattice point
are called centred. Different kinds of centring are possible in the various
crystal systems, and these may involve lattice points at the centres of
opposite pairs of faces (A, B, or C depending on which faces are centred),
at the centres of all faces (F), or at the body centre of the cell (I). We omit
here consideration of alternative cell choices for some trigonal structures
(R for rhombohedral); the treatment needed is more than completeness
is worth. Some forms of centring are not relevant for particular crystal
systems (e.g. there is no advantage in using any form of centred cell for
a triclinic structure), and the essentially different possible combinations
of lattice symmetry with primitive and centred cell choices leads to 14
distinct results, known as the 14 Bravais lattices (strictly speaking, this
term is incorrect, as it is the unit cell and not the lattice that is centred).
The appropriate combinations are included in Table 2.2 as ‘cell types’.

Introduction to symmetry and diffraction
2.4
Symmetry in the solid state
The impossibility of having some kinds of symmetry element, such
as a ﬁve-fold rotation axis, in the crystalline solid state might seem
to reduce the types of symmetry available in crystals compared with
individual molecules. This is, however, not the case, as the presence
of translation makes other kinds of symmetry possible. In a single
molecule, the repeated use of one particular symmetry operation even-
tually reproduces the original orientation of the molecule (for example,
two successive reﬂections in the same plane, or four 90◦rotations about a
four-fold axis), and this is a necessary property of any symmetry element
in any point group. Imagine now a mirror plane in a crystal structure,
containing two of the unit cell axes (say a and c) and perpendicular to
the third axis (b), but with an operation that combines reﬂection with
translation equal to half a unit cell repeat along one of the axes (a) instead
of just reﬂection. Two successive operations brings the structure back,
not to the same position, but exactly one unit cell removed along the
a-axis, which is entirely equivalent because of the pure lattice translation
symmetry. Such a symmetry operation is possible in an inﬁnite lattice
in the solid state, but not for an individual non-polymeric molecule.
This is called a glide plane. The glide direction in this example could
equally well be along the c-axis, or along a and c simultaneously, i.e.
along a unit cell face diagonal, in each case with a distance equal to half
the corresponding lattice repeat, so there are different possible ways of
combining reﬂection with translation. These are given symbols show-
ing the glide direction: a, b, c for a glide along one of the axes, n for
any diagonal glide, just as m stands for a pure reﬂection plane. (For
centred unit cells in some crystal systems, it is possible to have glide
planes with a translation component of one-quarter rather than half a
unit cell repeat unit, because two successive operations correspond to
translation from a cell corner to a centring lattice point instead of another
corner; such glide planes are called d, and they are not common.) In a
similar way, translation can be combined with rotation axes, the trans-
lation always being along the direction of the rotation axis and by an
amount equal to a multiple of 1/n of the lattice repeat in that direction,
where n is the order of the rotation axis. This gives a screw axis, for
which the conventional symbol is a number for the order of the axis
together with a subscript for the multiple of the smallest possible trans-
lation: thus, 41, 42 and 43 are possible four-fold screw axes. Some screw
axes, like screw threads, have handedness, so it is important to have a
convention about the combined directions of rotation and translation;
this occurs when the translation is not one half of the lattice repeat. A
41 axis is taken as a positive rotation of 90◦when viewed along the
axis with one-quarter translation away from the viewer, equivalent to
a right-handed screw thread. Examination of the combined effects of a
screw axis with pure lattice translation properties shows that the cor-
responding left-handed four-fold screw axis is 43, and there are similar
pairs of left-handed and right-handed screw axes for other orders of

rotation. The full set of possible glide planes and screw axes is shown
in Table 2.3.
In contrast to the situation in single molecules, symmetry elements
in the solid state do not all pass through one point; instead they are
regularly arranged parallel to each other, the symmetry elements of
each unit cell being repeated identically in all other unit cells. Just as
in molecules, however, there are only certain ways in which symmetry
elements can be put together consistently. The total number of possi-
ble arrangements of symmetry elements in the crystalline solid state is
exactly 230, and these arrangements are called space groups, by analogy
with point groups. Their symmetry properties are well established and
are available in standard reference books and tables, the most important
being the International Tables for Crystallography, Volume A, the contents
of which we will look at in Chapter 4.
The notation used for space groups is an extension of that for point
groups in crystallography, and this is one reason for using different
notation from that followed by spectroscopists. Each space group sym-
bol consists of a single capital letter to denote the cell centring, followed
by a combination of numbers (in some cases with a horizontal bar over
the top) and lower-case letters to show the presence of rotation, reﬂec-
tion and inversion symmetry in the structure. Because the combination
of some symmetry operations necessarily implies the presence of others
as well, not all the symmetry needs to be indicated, and there are con-
ventions about which take precedence in the symbols chosen. The rules
are different for each of the crystal systems, as follows.
Triclinic: no rotations or reﬂections, no need for centred cells, the only
question is whether inversion symmetry is absent or present, giving two
possible space groups P1 and P1, respectively.
Monoclinic: there is symmetry about the unique axis, normally taken
as the b-axis; this may be a two-fold rotation (2 or 21) along the axis, a
reﬂection plane (mirror m, or glide a, c or n) perpendicular to this axis, or
both of these together, e.g. C2, Pn, P21/c. There are 13 monoclinic space
groups.
Orthorhombic: the possibilities for monoclinic symmetry apply to all
three axes. Where both rotation and reﬂection are present for an axis,
only the reﬂection is given. Possible combinations are rotation only for

18
Introduction to symmetry and diffraction
all three axes, rotation and reﬂection for all three axes, and reﬂection for
two axes with rotation for the third; in the last case, it is conventional to
take the rotation axis along c. Examples are P212121, Aba2, Cmcm, Fdd2.
There are 59 orthorhombic space groups.
Tetragonal, trigonal and hexagonal: symmetry (including some kind
of 4-, 3- or 6-fold rotation, possibly with perpendicular reﬂection) for
the unique c-axis is given ﬁrst, then symmetry along the a- and b-axes
(equivalent to each other), then any symmetry lying between a and b,
e.g. P43212, R3c, P63/mmc. There are 68 tetragonal, 25 trigonal, and 27
hexagonal space groups.
Cubic: symmetry is given ﬁrst along the cell axes, then along the four
body diagonals (always 3 or 3), then along the face diagonals, e.g. P213,
Fd3c. There are 36 cubic space groups.
The occurrence of the different space groups in real structures is
far from equally distributed. Some space groups are extremely rare,
while others are very common. Most molecular materials crystallize in
triclinic, monoclinic or orthorhombic space groups, while higher sym-
metries are more commonly found for inorganic ionic and network
structures and minerals. Around one third of all crystal structures of
molecular compounds have space group P21/c, though the symbol for
this space group may be P21/a or P21/n if the unit cell axes are chosen dif-
ferently. Generally, screw axes and glide planes are more common than
pure rotations and reﬂections in crystal structures, except where indi-
vidual molecules themselves have these symmetry elements, because
the presence of translation components means that the molecules,
with irregular shapes and charge distributions, pack together more
effectively.
Returning to a point raised earlier, in the construction of a lattice,
the choice of the equivalent points in the crystal structure is arbitrary.
Another way of expressing this is that the choice of origin of the unit cell
(the point within one repeat unit that is assigned three zero co-ordinates)
is arbitrary. In high-symmetry inorganic crystal structures such as sim-
ple ionic salts, drawings and models often show atoms or ions at the
corners of unit cells, but this is not necessary and, in fact, it is unusual for
the structures of molecules that have no internal symmetry elements.
By convention in most space groups, the origin is chosen to lie on a
symmetry element; in particular, for centrosymmetric space groups, the
origin is normally placed on an inversion centre, because this simpliﬁes
the mathematics of Fourier calculations. In most cases symmetry ele-
ments lie between molecules, relating them together, rather than inside
molecules.
2.5
Diffraction and symmetry
The symmetry of a diffraction pattern is closely related to the symmetry
of the structure producing it, allowing us to deduce something about the
space group from the observed pattern. The symmetry of a diffraction

pattern is seen in the equivalence of different regions of it, which may be
related to each other by certain symmetry elements; this refers to both
the positions (due to the directions of individual diffracted beams) and
the intensities of the various reﬂections on a recorded pattern. Adiffrac-
tion pattern has a central point (corresponding to the reﬂection with all
zero indices) and so its symmetry is expressed in terms of a point group,
whereas the crystal structure has a space group; how are these related?
One important aspect of X-ray diffraction is that, in the absence of an
effect called anomalous scattering or anomalous dispersion, which is
rarely a large effect and is signiﬁcant usually only when heavier ele-
ments are present in a structure, every diffraction pattern has inversion
symmetry, whether or not the crystal structure is centrosymmetric; this
is known as Friedel’s Law. Therefore, of the 32 crystallographic point
groups, only 11 are possible as the symmetry of a diffraction pattern,
and these are known as the 11 Laue classes. Each space group has a
corresponding point group to which it is related (and is the point group
symmetry that a crystal would have if grown under ideal conditions),
and a corresponding Laue class. Clearly, with 230 space groups, 32 point
groups,and11Laueclasses,mostoftheLaueclasseshavealargenumber
of related space groups.
Toderive the point groupfromaspacegroup,theinitialcapitalletteris
ignored (this refers to the cell centring, which is irrelevant to point group
symmetry), then all screw axis symbols are replaced by the correspond-
ing pure rotation and all glide planes are replaced by pure reﬂections.
Thus, for example, 21 becomes 2, 65 becomes 6, and all of a, b, c, n and
d become m: P21/c →2/m, Aba2 →mm2, I41/acd →4/mmm. To derive
the Laue class from the point group, add an inversion centre if there is
not already one; in many cases, this will automatically generate further
symmetry elements, and the result is just one of the 11 point groups
that have inversion symmetry. For each of the three most common (and
lowest-symmetry)crystalsystems,thereisjustoneLaueclass;foreachof
theotherstherearetwo.Thecorrespondenceofdifferentcrystalsystems,
point groups and Laue classes is shown in Table 2.4.
We thus have the following forms of symmetry that are important in
crystallography: the space group (choice of 230) is the complete symme-
try of the crystal structure and is one property that has to be established
as part of determining the structure by diffraction methods; the Laue
class (choice of 11) is the point-group symmetry of the diffraction pat-
tern if Friedel’s Law applies, and is directly observed in the diffraction
experiment; a point group is the collection of all symmetry operations
(excluding any with translation components) about a particular central
point in a single object. Point group symmetry can be used to refer to
the shape of a crystal, the shape of a single unit cell, or any chosen
point within a crystal structure, e.g. the position of an atom or the cen-
tre of a molecule. The point group symmetry of a molecule in a crystal
structure, taking account not only of the molecule itself but also of its
environment, may be equal to or lower than the point group symmetry
of the same molecule in isolation; it can not be higher without changing

order of the symbols for a particular point group, e.g. 62m instead of 6m2, but these are the same point group.

the shape of the molecule or by invoking structural disorder, a topic
not covered here. If Friedel’s Law does not apply in the presence of sig-
niﬁcant anomalous dispersion for a non-centrosymmetric structure, the
symmetry of the diffraction pattern will be one of the point groups not
included in the list of 11 Laue classes, the point group associated with
the space group of this structure.
2.6
Further points
In pure lattice translation terms, the repeat unit of a crystal structure is
either one complete unit cell (primitive cells) or a well-deﬁned fraction
of one unit cell (one half for A, B, C or I centring, one third for rhombo-
hedral R structures described on a conventional trigonal unit cell, one
quarter for F centring). If any inversion, rotation or reﬂection symmetry
is present in the structure (including screw axes and glide planes), then
these additional symmetry elements relate atoms and molecules to each
other within each unit cell as well as between unit cells, so the unique,
symmetry-independent part of the structure is only a fraction of the
lattice repeat unit, the fraction depending on the amount of symmetry
present. This unique structural portion is called the asymmetric unit of
the structure, and it may consist of a single molecule, a group of more
than one molecule, a fraction of a molecule possessing symmetry within
itself, or a combination of different molecules and/or ions, for example
including co-crystallized solvent molecules. Operation of all the space
group symmetry (translation, inversion, rotation and reﬂection) gener-
ates the complete crystal structure from the asymmetric unit. The details
of the asymmetric unit, together with the unit cell parameters and the
space group, are what need to be determined in order to describe the
crystal structure.

2.6
Further points
21
Any point in a crystal structure that does not lie on a rotation axis,
a mirror plane or an inversion centre has point group symmetry 1 (C1)
and will be related by symmetry to a number of other equivalent points
in the same unit cell. This is called a general position, and each space
group has a ﬁxed value for the number of equivalent general positions,
ranging from 1 for space group P1 (no symmetry other than pure lat-
tice translation, so every point in the unit cell is unique) to 192 for the
highest-symmetry cubic space groups with F unit cells. For a point
on a symmetry element without translation component, operation of
that element leaves the point unchanged, so the number of equivalent
points in the unit cell is lower by a fraction depending on the nature
of the symmetry element (2, 3, 4 or 6 for a rotation axis, 2 for reﬂec-
tion or inversion). Such positions are called special positions, and can
be occupied only by molecules that themselves possess the appropriate
symmetry. In some space groups there are no special positions. In oth-
ers there are special positions where two or more symmetry elements
intersect; the point group symmetry of such special positions is corre-
spondingly higher, and the number of equivalent points in the unit cell
correspondingly lower. Screw axes and glide planes do not give rise
to special positions, because of their translation components. Atoms on
special positions may require symmetry-imposed constraints on their
co-ordinates and/or displacement parameters during reﬁnement; most
of these are generated automatically by modern programs.
For a crystal structure containing just one kind of molecule (simi-
lar arguments apply to structures containing more than one kind of
molecule,suchassolvatesandco-crystals,andtoioniccrystalstructures,
but there are some additional complications), the number of molecules
in each unit cell is conventionally known as Z. A related parameter of
interest is the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit, which is
given the symbol Z’. The most common value for this is 1, but it is
greater than one in a signiﬁcant number of structures, where there is
more than one molecule (chemically identical but not related by crys-
tallographic symmetry) in the asymmetric unit, and it is less than one if
there is one independent molecule that itself lies on a crystallographic
symmetry element (rotation axis, mirror plane or inversion centre).
One other symmetry term needs to be recognized before these prin-
ciples are applied in trying to work out the possible space groups for a
material from its observed diffraction and other properties. The metric
symmetry is the observed symmetry of the unit cell of a structure with-
out reference to its contents. It takes no account of information from
the Laue symmetry and looks only at the shape of the unit cell. It can
thus lead to false conclusions. For example, if a monoclinic structure
fortuitously has a β angle close to 90◦, the unit cell has the same shape
as for genuine orthorhombic symmetry. The metric symmetry is always
at least as high as the Laue symmetry, and may be higher; for the four
high-symmetry crystal systems, the metric symmetry is the same as the
higher of the two possible Laue classes in each case. Trigonal primitive
and hexagonal unit cells are indistinguishable in terms of their basic

shape, but some trigonal crystal structures have a different (rhombohe-
dral) lattice not discussed here in detail, so there are just seven possible
different metric symmetries.

chiral molecules; a polar point group (P) is one in which at least one par-
ticular direction is symmetrically distinct from the opposite direction;
C means a centrosymmetric point group. The order of a point group is
the number of equivalent general positions in each of the related space
groups with P unit cells, and must be multiplied by 2 for A, C and I, by
3 for R, and by 4 for F cells. For some tetragonal, trigonal and hexagonal
point groups, different arrangements of symmetry elements are possible
for the a- and b-axes and the directions lying between them, leading to
the use of alternative symbols so that different but related space groups
are clearly distinguished; these are shown in adjacent rows.

dimensional repeating patterns (Traidcraft gift wrap-

outline a unit cell (possible shapes are oblique, rectan-
gular, square, and hexagonal; a rectangular unit cell can
be primitive or centred). Find the symmetry elements;
for a 2D pattern the following are possible: 2-, 3-, 4- and
6-fold rotations, mirror lines, and glide lines (mirrors
with a half-unit-cell translation component parallel to
the reﬂection line); in 2D inversion symmetry is the same
as a 2-fold rotation. Show what fraction of the unit cell

Crystal growth and
evaluation
Alexander Blake
3.1
Introduction
Whether growing crystals or giving advice to someone else trying to
do so, it is vital to remember that the quality of the crystal from which
diffraction data are acquired is generally the main determinant of the
ﬁnal quality of the structure. The effects of a suboptimal crystal will
propagate through data collection, structure solution and reﬁnement to
affect the quality of the ﬁnal structure, in which unsatisfactorily high
uncertainties may limit useful comparison and discussion. It may be
difﬁcult or impossible to get such a structure published.
3.2
Protect your crystals
Before you start trying to grow crystals you need to think about how
they will be handled. They will need to be extracted from the vessel they
grew in without suffering any damage. Less obviously, some containers
make this easier than others: an oversized one like a 250-ml round-
bottomed ﬂask makes the procedure of ﬁnding and removing a small
crystal unnecessarily difﬁcult. At the other extreme, a container with a
small aperture that will not admit a narrow spatula or pipette is also
troublesome. You should avoid screw-top or other containers that nar-
row near the top, as the ‘shoulders’ prevent easy removal of the crystals:
a small vial with straight walls works best.
Many crystals lose solvent on removal from the solution in which
they have grown (mother liquor). Although the envelope of the crys-
tals may appear intact, even a few per cent solvent loss usually renders
them useless for structural analysis. This is particularly common for
crystals grown from chlorocarbon solvents like dichloromethane and
chloroform, but can affect crystals grown from almost any solvent, water
included. If a crystal loses solvent and then does not behave well on
the diffractometer, there is no way to know whether the original crys-
tal was unsuitable, or whether the poor diffraction was due solely to
27

28
Crystal growth and evaluation
solvent loss. For this reason you should keep crystals under mother
liquor whenever possible. There are other good reasons for doing this –
see below.
3.3
Crystal growth
The term recrystallization has two related meanings but there are crucial
differences between these. In the synthesis and puriﬁcation of compounds,
the aim is to maximize purity and yield, although these can be mutually
exclusive.Thematerialisoftenprecipitatedveryrapidly(∼1s),resulting
in microcrystalline or virtually amorphous products that are useless
for conventional single-crystal work. For diffraction work the object is to
obtain a small number (one may do) of relatively large (∼0.1–0.4 mm)
singlecrystals.Aslongasthisisachieved,yieldisirrelevantandpurityis
likelytobeenhanced.Tothisend,crystalsshouldbegrown slowly,taking
from minutes to months depending on the system. To understand why
this is important, visualize the process of growth at a crystal surface. The
greater the rate at which molecules arrive at the surface, the less time
they have to orient themselves in relation to molecules already there:
random accretion is more likely, leading to crystals that are twinned or
disordered. Suitable growth conditions include the absence of dust and
vibration: if these are present they can lead to small or non-singular
crystals.
3.4
Survey of methods
3.4.1
Solution methods
These are by far the most ﬂexible and widely used. They are suitable for
use with molecular compounds that are the subject of most crystal struc-
ture determinations. The use of solvents means that crystals can grow
separately from each other. It is therefore important not to let a solu-
tion dry out, as crystals could become encrusted and may not remain
single. When choosing solvents remember the general rule that ‘like dis-
solves like’: look for a solvent that is similar to the compound (in terms
of polarity, functional groups, etc.) and an antisolvent that is dissimi-
lar to it in order to reduce its solubility (see below). Information about
solvents is available from several sources (e.g. Handbook of Physics and
Chemistry, chromatographic elution data), and the process of synthesiz-
ing and purifying a compound will often confer a knowledge of suitable
solvents. Mixing solvents allows manipulation of solubility: a mixture
of solvent A (in which a compound is too soluble) and antisolvent B
(in which it is not sufﬁciently soluble) may be more useful than either
alone. If crystals grown from one solvent are poor in quality, try differ-
ent solvents or mixtures of solvents. Solution methods can be extremely
ﬂexible: a number of crystallizations, differing in the proportions of sol-
vents A and B used, can be set up to run in parallel. If a particular range

3.4
Survey of methods
29
of proportions appears to be more successful in producing crystals it
can be investigated more closely by decreasing the difference between
successive mixtures of A and B.
It is important that any vessels used for crystal growth should be
free of contaminants. Older containers also tend to have a large number
of scratches and other surface defects, providing multiple nucleation
points and tending to give large numbers of small crystals. Two factors
that favour the formation of twinned crystals are the presence of impu-
rities and uneven thermal gradients. Conversely, if the inner surface of
a container is too smooth this may inhibit crystallization. If this appears
to be the case, gently scratching the surface with a metal spatula a few
times may be effective. Some of the possible variations are described
brieﬂy below, and virtually all methods described can be adapted to
accommodate air sensitivity.
Concentration. If the volume of a solution is reduced, for example
by evaporation of a volatile solvent, the concentration of the solute will
rise until it begins to crystallize. When using mixed solvents the poorer
solvent should be the less volatile so that the solubility of the solute
decreases upon evaporation (but see Fig. 3.1). The rate of evaporation
can be controlled in various ways, for example by altering the tempera-
ture of the sample or by adjusting the size of the aperture through which
the solvent vapour can escape. As solvents are frequently ﬂammable or
irritants, it is important to work on the smallest scale possible and ensure
than any vapour released from the solution is safely dealt with. Avoid
obvious hazards such as those that will arise if large volumes of diethyl
ether or other highly volatile solvents are allowed to evaporate in a
closed container such as a refrigerator.
As noted above, it is highly undesirable to let a solution evaporate
to dryness as this will allow otherwise suitable crystals to become
encrusted,growintoanaggregateorbecontaminatedbyimpurities.The
crystals may be degraded by loss of solvent of crystallization, especially
ifchlorocarbonsolventssuchasdichloromethanehavebeenused.Itmay
prove impossible to identify good crystals even if these are present, and
extracting them undamaged from a mass of material may prove difﬁcult
or impossible.

Fig. 3.1 A method of controlling solubility
by selectively removing the less volatile sol-
vent in which the compound is more solu-
ble. This (chlorocarbon) solvent is absorbed
by the rubber Subaseal, while the antisol-
vent (diethyl ether) is not, leading to a
more concentrated solution and eventually
to crystallization.
Apparently sealed NMR tubes that have been forgotten at the back of
a fume cupboard or fridge for weeks or months are a fruitful source of
good-quality crystals: there is in fact slow evaporation of solvent and
crystals are able to grow undisturbed. As long as the NMR tube is clean
and relatively unscratched the smooth inner surface and narrow bore
provide an excellent environment for crystal growth.
Cooling. Either make up a hot, nearly saturated solution and allow
it to cool slowly towards room temperature or make up such a solu-
tion at room temperature and cool it slowly in a fridge or freezer. The
cooling rate can be reduced by exploiting the fact that the larger and
more massive an object, the longer it will take to lose heat. Thus, a hot
solution in a large vessel (or in a small vessel within a larger one) will
cool relatively slowly (Fig. 3.2, left). Similarly, a sample tube containing

a solution will cool at a slower rate if it is contained in a metal block that
was originally at room temperature, or if surrounded by an effective
layer of insulation. Cooling methods are based on the generally valid
assumption that solubility decreases with temperature. There are rare
exceptions to this (e.g. Na2SO4 in water) and some solubilities rise so
rapidly with temperature that it can be difﬁcult to control crystalliza-
tion (e.g. of KNO3 from water). However, it is usually possible to ﬁnd
a combination of solute and solvent where solubility varies slowly and
controllably with temperature.
Fig. 3.3 Soxhlet apparatus.
Convection. The aim here is to establish a temperature gradient across
the solution, so that material dissolves in the warmer area and deposits
in the colder. This gradient can be established by various means, for
example (a) allow sunlight to shine on one part of the vessel; (b) put one
part of the vessel against a cooler surface, such as a window at night;
(c) construct an apparatus with low-power electrical heating elements
in some sections (Fig. 3.2 right). A smooth concentration gradient will
give the best results.
One method that combines variation of both concentration and tem-
perature and is especially useful for sparingly soluble compounds is
Soxhlet extraction (Fig. 3.3). The recycling of the solvent is the key fac-
tor here and crystals can even appear in the reﬂuxing solvent. Failing
this, they normally appear after slow cooling of the solution. There are
several other methods available to control concentration. One of these
is based on osmosis, where the solvent passes through a semipermeable
membrane into a concentrated solution of an inert species. The resulting
increase in the concentration of the solute may lead to crystal formation.
Solvent diffusion. This method is based on the fact that a compound
will dissolve well in certain solvents (‘good solvents’) but not in others
(‘poor solvents’ or antisolvents), which must be co-miscible. Dissolve

the compound in the ‘good solvent’ and place this solution in a narrow
tube. Using a syringe ﬁtted with a ﬁne needle, very slowly inject the
neat antisolvent. If it is lighter than the solution, layer it on top; if it is
denser, inject it slowly into the bottom of the tube to form a layer under
the solution. Injecting the solvent is better than running it down the
side of the tube. If the tube is protected from vibration, these layers will
mix slowly and crystals will grow at the interface (Fig. 3.4). If necessary,
cooling of the tube can be used both to lower the rate of diffusion and
to reduce the solubility.

Vapour diffusion. This method is also called isothermal distillation.
The antisolvent diffuses through the vapour phase into a solution of
the compound in the ‘good solvent’, thereby reducing the solubility
(Fig. 3.5). The advantages of this method include the relatively slow
rate of diffusion, its controllability and its adaptability, for example in
combination with Schlenk techniques to grow crystals of air-sensitive
samples. It is usually worth trying vapour diffusion as it frequently
succeeds where other methods have failed. A variant on this is the
hanging-drop method, principally used for the growth of crystals of
proteins and other macromolecules: the precipitant sits in a well and dif-
fuses slowly into a drop of solution suspended on a glass slide covering
the well.
If you are using a needle to make holes in the polythene cap of a
sample vial, take particular care to remove completely any slugs of poly-
thene formed by this procedure. They may be inside the vial or hanging
loosely from the cap. If these slugs get into your sample they can look
remarkably like large single crystals (Fig. 3.6), and even show plausible
optical properties due to the stress of their formation. They can often be
identiﬁed by the presence of a tail-like extension, but this is not always
present, and they are often identiﬁed only by their diffraction pattern
(Fig. 3.7). Making holes from the inside of the cap outwards makes it
easier to check for the presence of slugs, but close scrutiny of vial and
cap is always worthwhile.
Reactant diffusion. It is sometimes possible to combine synthesis and
crystal growth. In favourable cases crystals may simply drop out of the
reaction mixture, but the rate of many reactions means that crystals form
rapidly and are therefore small and of low quality. If the reaction rate
Fig. 3.6 A polythene slug produced by using a needle to make holes in the cap of a vial.

32
Crystal growth and evaluation
can be controlled by slow addition of one of the reactants this offers
one way to overcome the problem. The best control is often achieved
by controlling the rate at which reactant solutions mix, by interposing
a semipermeable barrier [e.g.membrane (Fig. 3.8 left), sinter or an inert
liquid such as Nujol] or by the use of gel crystallization (see below).
Another variant involves placing a solid reactant at the bottom of a
tube, covering it with a solvent in which it is known to dissolve slowly,
and carefully adding an upper layer consisting of a solution of a second
reactant (Fig. 3.8 right). The additional time required for the solid to
dissolve reduces the rate at which reaction can occur.
Crystals of zeolites and of many other materials with network struc-
tures cannot be recrystallised and therefore can only be obtained from
the reaction mixture. Fine tuning of the reaction conditions and the pro-
portions and concentrations of reactants probably offer the only realistic
ways to control crystal size and quality.

Crystallization from gels is an under-exploited technique for obtain-
ing single crystals of compounds of low solubility. Because the mixing
of the solutions is dominated by diffusion through a viscous medium,
undesirable competing processes such as convection and sedimentation
are minimized. It is therefore possible to establish laboratory conditions
for crystallization that closely approximate the microgravity of space.
A typical arrangement is a U-tube half-ﬁlled with gel, with a solution
of one reactant in the top of one arm and a solution of another reac-
tant in the other. As gels are generally colourless, it is much easier to
detect and isolate crystals if a product is strongly coloured. There are
various recipes for the preparation of gels [e.g. Arend and Connelly
(1982); http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/lutz/growing/gel.html] and it is
possible to treat gels with organic solvents to produce versions suitable
for use with hydrophobic or moisture-sensitive compounds.
Seed crystals. Sometimes crystallization of a compound gives crystals
that, although otherwise of good quality, are clearly too small for struc-
ture analysis. A small number of these can be used as seeds by placing
them into a warm saturated solution of the compound and allowing the
solution to cool slowly. The hope here is that crystal growth will occur
preferentially at the seed to give a suitably large single crystal. A con-
tainer free of contaminants and scratches is strongly recommended here.

3.4.2
Sublimation
Sublimation (Fig. 3.9) is the direct conversion of a solid material to its
gaseous state. It has been harnessed to produce solvent-free crystals of
electronic materials but it is applicable to any solid with a signiﬁcant
vapour pressure at a temperature below its decomposition or melting
point. The basic experimental arrangement is simple: a closed, usually
evacuated vessel in which the solid is heated (if necessary) and a cold
surface on which crystals grow. If possible, avoid heating the solid, as
lower sublimation temperatures often lead to better crystals. If the solid
sublimes too readily the vessel can be cooled. If a compound has a low
vapour pressure, sublimation can be enhanced by evacuating the vessel
or by using a cold ﬁnger containing acetone/dry ice (−78◦C) rather than
cold water (5−10 ◦C).
3.4.3
Fluid-phase growth
It is possible to grow crystals directly from liquids or gases, often by
employing in-situ techniques. Fluid-phase methods encompass both
high-temperature growth from melts and low-temperature growth from
compounds that melt below ambient temperature (Fig. 3.10). High-
temperature methods (Bridgman, Czochralski, zone reﬁning, etc.) are
used widely in the puriﬁcation and growth of crystals of semicon-
ductors and other electronic materials but are limited to compounds
that melt without decomposition, thereby excluding many molecular
compounds. Moreover, it is much more difﬁcult to prevent unwanted

34
Crystal growth and evaluation
phenomena such as twinning than with solution methods, and often
impossible to separate overlapping or adjacent crystals.
Liquids or gases must be contained, for example in a capillary tube.
One consequence of this is that crystallization conditions must be con-
trolled to give only one crystal in that part of the tube that will be within
the X-ray beam. Once crystals have grown it is usually impossible to
separate them physically. Unlike crystal growth from solution there is
essentially only one variable, namely the temperature of the sample.
However, there are several ways to adjust this and the method can
be chosen to give coarse or ﬁne control. A typical strategy for crystal
growth involves the establishment and manipulation of a stable inter-
face between liquid and solid phases. With air-stable compounds that
crystallise in a fridge or freezer it is only necessary to keep them cold
until they are transferred into the cold stream of the diffractometer’s
low-temperature device.
3.4.4
Solid-state synthesis
In favourable circumstances it may be possible to produce adequate
single crystals, but microcrystalline samples are far more typical. For
example, most high-Tc superconductors do not give single crystals and
their structures have been determined using powder diffraction meth-
ods.Aswiththesynthesisofzeolitesfromsolution,variationofsynthetic
conditions is likely to be the only route to better single crystals.
3.4.5
General comments
The details of crystal growth are often poorly understood, especially
for new compounds, and it is important not to be discouraged if initial
attempts fail. For example, microcrystalline material is not immediately
useful but it does indicate that the compound is crystalline and that
modiﬁcation of the crystallization technique could result in larger crys-
tals. It is always a good idea to try a range of techniques, keeping a
detailed record of the exact conditions used and the results obtained.
This not only allows identiﬁcation of the most promising methods and
conditions for the current sample but also means that in future there
will be a database of procedures and their outcomes to consult. Crys-
tal quality improves with experience, and early attempts often produce
poor-quality crystals. It is important to continue until it is clear that no
further improvement is likely.
In some cases, regardless of the method employed, crystals either do
not form or are unsuitable. At this stage, the best way to proceed may
be to modify the compound. With ionic compounds it may be practical
to change the counter-ion (e.g. BF−
4 for PF−
6 , or vice versa). With neutral
compounds it may be a simple matter to change some chemically unim-
portant peripheral group. In one case altering a piperidine substituent
to morpholine, which merely involves changing one remote CH2 group
for an oxygen atom, led to a spectacular improvement in crystal quality.

3.5
Evaluation
35
3.5
Evaluation
Once crystals have appeared it is necessary to ascertain whether they
are suitable for data collection. Some of the methods used are extremely
rapid and can save large amounts of diffractometer time. During these
procedures take care to prevent damage to the crystals, for example by
loss of solvent after removal from the mother liquor. If spare crystals
are available, leave one or two exposed on a microscope slide and check
them regularly for signs of deterioration, using microscopy as described
below. It is vital to apply the tests outlined below optimistically so that
only crystals that are incontrovertibly unsuitable are rejected. Any that
give uncertain indications of their quality should be given the beneﬁt of
the doubt.
3.5.1
Microscopy
Visual examination under a microscope takes only a few seconds or min-
utes, yet can identify unsuitable crystals that might otherwise occupy
hours on a diffractometer. A microscope with a polarizing attachment,
up to ×40 magniﬁcation, a good depth of ﬁeld and a strong light source
is required. Crystal examination consists of three steps.
STEPONE:Withtheanalyzercomponentofthepolarizingattachment
out (i.e. not in use) look at the crystals in normal light to determine if they
are well shaped. Reject crystals that are curved or otherwise deformed,
have signiﬁcant passengers that cannot be removed, or that show re-
entrant angles. Be wary of rejecting crystals simply on the grounds
that they are small, unless similarly sized crystals of the same type of
compound have been consistently unsuccessful in the past. For organic
compounds containing no element heavier than oxygen, crystals smaller
than 0.1×0.1×0.1 mm3 seldom give good data with conventional labora-
tory instruments, although this size or smaller may be ideal for crystals
of, say, an osmium cluster compound.
STEPTWO: With the analyzer in, most crystals in a typical sample will
transmit polarized light. The exceptions are tetragonal and hexagonal
crystals viewed along their unique c-axis, and cubic crystals viewed
in any orientation. Tetragonal or hexagonal crystals transmit polarised
light when viewed along other directions but cubic crystals cannot be
distinguished from amorphous materials such as glass by this method.
Fortunately, these three crystal systems together account for fewer than
5% of molecular crystals.
STEP THREE: If a crystal transmits polarized light, turn the micro-
scope stage until the crystal turns dark (extinguishes), then light again,
a phenomenon that will occur every 90◦(Fig. 3.11). This extinction is
the best optical indication of crystal quality, and it should be complete
throughout the crystal and be relatively sharp (∼1◦). Any crystal that
does not extinguish completely is not single and can be rejected imme-
diately. Lack of sharpness may indicate a large mosaic spread within the
crystal.Acrystal that never extinguishes is almost certainly an aggregate

of smaller crystals. When examining a batch of crystals, establish both
the general quality of the sample and whether there are individual
crystals suitable for further study.
3.5.2
X-ray photography
Photography began to decline in popularity as data collection using
four-circle instruments advanced, in part because it was often quicker
to record a full dataset than to obtain a complete set of photographs.
Photography retained the advantage that it gave a better view of the
reciprocal lattice than can be obtained from the list of reﬂections output
by a four-circle diffractometer, and can record any diffraction occurring
at other than the expected positions. Other than for specialist applica-
tions, the spread of area-detector instruments has essentially consigned
X-ray photography to history.Area-detector images give much the same
view of the reciprocal lattice as ﬁlm, but do so much more quickly,
ﬂexibly and precisely without the need to process ﬁlm.
3.5.3
Diffractometry
The ultimate test of a crystal is how it behaves on the diffractometer.
Reﬂections must possess sufﬁcient intensity, be well shaped (not split
or excessively broadened) and index to give a sensible unit cell. Area-
detector instruments combine some of the best features of photography
and electronic counters and some can establish the quality of a crystal in
seconds. It is worth bearing in mind that area detectors can often tolerate
crystals of apparently appalling quality.
3.6
Crystal mounting
3.6.1
Standard procedures
For crystals that are stable to ambient conditions of air, moisture and
light, the requirements of mounting are simple. The crystal is ﬁxed
securely with a reliable adhesive (e.g. epoxy resin) onto a glass or quartz
ﬁbre that is in turn glued into a ‘pip’ that ﬁts into the well at the top of

the goniometer head. The aim is to ensure that the crystal does not move
with respect to this head. This means rejecting adhesives that do not set
ﬁrmly (e.g. Vaseline or Evo-Stik) or mounting media that are not rigid
(e.g. plasticine, Blu-tak or picene wax). On some diffractometers crys-
tals are spun at up to 4000◦/min, and an insecure mounting will lead
to serious problems of crystal movement. A suitable ﬁbre (e.g. of Pyrex
glass) is just thick enough to support the crystal at a distance of about
5 mm above the pip. Fibres that are too thick add unnecessarily to errors
via absorption and background effects, while those that are too thin can
allow the crystal to vibrate, especially if it is being cooled in a stream of
cold gas. For normal-sized crystals, the ﬁbre should be thinner than the
crystal. For small or thin crystals use a ‘two-stage’ ﬁbre, which consists
of a glass ﬁbre onto which is glued approximately 1 mm of glass wool,
onto which the crystal is attached. The ﬁbre confers stability while the
short length of glass wool reduces the amount of glass in the X-ray beam
(Fig. 3.12).
This paragraph outlines the basic procedure for mounting a crystal.
First, mix the epoxy resin, which will typically become tacky within ﬁve
minutes and thereafter remain useable for a further ﬁve. Place the tip
of the ﬁbre into the resin and use the microscope to check that it has
actually become coated. Ideally, the aim is to attach the tip of the ﬁbre
to the side of the crystal, thereby minimizing the amount of glass in the
X-ray beam. Establish the size of the crystals, cutting them to size with
a scalpel or razor blade if necessary. When picking up a crystal there is
a danger of gluing it onto the slide, but this can be easily avoided: move
the adhesive-tipped ﬁbre forward until it makes contact with the side
of the crystal, then continue moving the ﬁbre forward and upwards to
lift the crystal clear of the slide. [With thin plates this procedure may
not be possible. If there is no alternative to mounting a crystal with a
ﬁbre along an edge or across a face of the crystal the ﬁbre must be as
thin as possible: a ‘two-stage’ ﬁbre may be appropriate.] Also ensure
that the crystal height can be adjusted to bring it into the X-ray beam:
it is frustrating to ﬁnd later that this cannot be done due to a ﬁbre that

38
Crystal growth and evaluation
is too long or too short – on many instruments the X-ray beam passes
68 mm above the upper surface of the φ circle.
Instead of a simple ﬁbre, some crystallographers prefer to mount the
crystal on the end of a capillary tube (less glass in the beam for the
same diameter); on a number of short lengths of glass wool attached to
a thicker ﬁbre (ditto); or on quartz ﬁbres (more rigid for a given diame-
ter). Some of the different methods for mounting crystals are shown in
Fig. 3.12.
3.6.2
Air-sensitive crystals
The traditional way to protect sensitive crystals is to seal them (using
a ﬂame or epoxy resin) into a capillary tube, usually made from Linde-
mann glass that is composed of low-atomic-weight elements (Fig. 3.12).
Even so, this puts a large volume of glass in the X-ray beam, so the tube
and wall diameters should be as thin as practicable. The most sensitive
crystals can be handled and encapsulated within a dry-box. When plan-
ning a low-temperature data collection, ensure that the top end of the
tube is well rounded and that there are only a few millimetres of glass
above the crystal position, otherwise severe icing will result (alterna-
tively, see the second paragraph following). Crystals that desolvate may
need either solvent vapour or mother liquor sealed into the tube with
them. Unless crystals are mechanically robust, care must be taken when
loading them into capillary tubes. With crystals that are both fragile
and susceptible to solvent loss, a variant of a technique used by protein
crystallographers may be helpful. Break the sealed end off a capillary
tube and coat the ﬁrst few millimetres of its inner surface with freshly
mixed epoxy resin; place some crystals with their mother liquor in a well
and isolate a good crystal; bring the open end of the tube through the
surface of the solution; it may take some practice, but capillary action
should draw the crystal along with some mother liquor into the tube;
the crystal will stick to one side of the tube, which can then be sealed at
both ends.
Many crystals can be protected by coating them with materials such
as nail varnish, superglue or epoxy resin. As long as the coating confers
sufﬁcient protection and does not dissolve the crystal or react with it, this
can be a simple and effective solution to air sensitivity that is applicable
whencoolingofthecrystalisimpossible.Thissituationcanarisebecause
an ambient-temperature dataset is required, a phase change is known
or suspected to occur below ambient temperature, or because cooling
causes an unacceptable degree of mechanical strain within the crystal.
A low-temperature device permits the use of an extremely ﬂexible
method for handling air-sensitive crystals. This involves transferring,
examining and mounting the crystal under a suitable viscous oil. Upon
cooling, the oil forms an impenetrable ﬁlm around the crystal and also
acts as an adhesive to attach the crystal ﬁrmly to the ﬁbre. For crystals
that do not survive room temperature, the technique can be combined
with low-temperature handling, which normally involves passing a

stream of cold nitrogen gas across the microscope stage. Various oils
have been used but perﬂuoropolyethers have the advantages of inert-
ness and immiscibility with solvents. Suitable products are available
from ABCR and Lancaster Synthesis; these have varying degrees of
inertnessandviscosityandsomeexperimentationmaybeneededtoﬁnd
the most suitable. For many crystals silicone grease will be an adequate
substitute.
An alternative method, popular with protein crystallographers and
suitable for very thin crystals that are too fragile to be picked up on
a ﬁbre, is the solvent loop (Fig. 3.12). A small loop of a ﬁbre such as
mohair or a single strand from dental ﬂoss is used to lift the crystal in
a ﬁlm of solvent or oil that is then ﬂash cooled on the diffractometer
to immobilize the crystal. (For more details see Garman and Schneider,
1997.)
3.6.3
Crystal alignment
The ﬁnal step is to attach the goniometer head to the φ circle of the
diffractometer and optically adjust the crystal so that its centre does
not move when it is rotated. Do not assume that the microscope cross-
hairs represent the true centre, although if the instrument is reasonably
well set up this should be a useful starting point. Centring is an iterative
procedure, and the following general outline should be possible on most
instruments:
• check that the crystal is approximately central in X and Y by check-
ing at φ = 0, 90, 180 and 270◦then set the height Z approximately
• view the crystal at φ = 0 and 180◦, then at 90 and 270◦. At each
position any lateral offset must be the same as that 180◦away
• on instruments with ﬁxed χ circles the height Z can be checked
by rotating ω through 180◦; with a motorized χ circle the height is
checked at χ = −90 and +90◦
• repeat the two previous steps until convergence is achieved.

Space-group
determination
William Clegg
4.1
Introduction
At some stage in the determination of a crystal structure by diffraction
methods, it is necessary to decide which is the correct space group out of
the possible 230. In many cases the choice is narrowed down quite early
in the process, when the probable crystal system is indicated by the mea-
surement of unit cell parameters, and the ﬁnal choice is made once the
intensitydatahavebeencollected.Atthisstagetheinformationavailable
may lead to an unambiguous choice of space group, but for other struc-
tures the space group is not completely clear until structure reﬁnement
has been successfully carried out in one of the possible space groups.
Information about the space group is obtained from a number of
sources: the unit cell shape (the metric symmetry) and centring; the
Laue class for the complete diffraction pattern; the systematic absence
(zero intensities) of certain subgroups of reﬂections in the data set; the
statistical distribution of intensities; other physical properties of the
material being studied; and any prior knowledge of certain aspects of
the structure.
There is no single universal procedure for space-group determina-
tion; the methods depend on the available information and its reliability.
Although automatic computer programs are widely used, their results
and the basis of their decisions should always be carefully examined, as
mistakes are easily made.
At least some indication of the space group, or at least of the crystal
system and preferably of the Laue class and crystal point group, is use-
ful during the measurement of intensity data, in order to ensure that all
symmetry-unique reﬂections are measured and none missed. With serial
diffractometers, too much time spent measuring large amounts of equiv-
alent data can be avoided, but with area detectors this is a less important
consideration and, in any case, a high degree of symmetry-redundancy
of data is useful for conﬁrmation of the symmetry, for improvement
of data precision, and for assessment and application of corrections for
systematic errors such as absorption.

Space-group determination
Where there is uncertainty about the symmetry, it is best to assume
the lowest possible symmetry during data collection. In structure solu-
tion and reﬁnement, however, the highest possible symmetry should be
taken ﬁrst, with lower symmetry considered only if necessary, avoiding
the danger of missing some symmetry and describing the structure in a
lower-symmetry space group than is correct; in some cases this is a poor
description, but in others it leads to serious errors, particularly where
an inversion centre has been missed.
Some or all of the following stages are involved in working out the
correct space group for a structure, not necessarily in the order given
here. In most of these descriptions, we assume ideal behaviour, and
some of the problems found in real life are considered later.
4.2
Prior knowledge and information other
than from diffraction
Sometimes it is possible to restrict the choice of space groups because
we know something about the material being investigated. One of the
best examples is the study of a compound that is known to be chi-
ral and enantiomerically pure. This expectation may come from the
known synthetic procedure, extraction of a natural product, or phys-
ical measurements. In such a case the individual molecules have no
improper rotation axes (including reﬂection and inversion), and these
symmetry elements must also be absent from the crystal structure as a
whole, because all molecules are of the same hand: any improper rota-
tion requires equal numbers of left and right hands. This immediately
reduces the number of possible point groups from 32 to 11, namely those
that contain only rotation symmetry (or none at all). These point groups
are marked as enantiomorphous in Table 2.5.
Other indications of the absence or presence of certain symmetry
elements may come from the external morphology of well-developed
crystals, or from physical properties such as piezoelectricity, pyroelec-
tricity, or non-linear optical behaviour. These measurements are not
always easy or reliable, however, and are not widely used. By contrast,
simple optical properties should always be examined with a microscope
equipped with crossed polars and a revolving horizontal stage. Apart
from anything else, this gives an indication of whether a crystal is likely
to be single and of reasonable quality and makes it easier to select and
mount a suitable one. Most transparent single crystals under these con-
ditions will appear bright against a dark ﬁeld of view, but will turn dark
quite sharply when rotated into four orientations separated successively
by 90◦. This property is called optical extinction (not to be confused
with X-ray extinction, a phenomenon associated with diffraction). Lack
of any well-deﬁned extinction positions usually indicates some kind of
multiplecrystalunsuitablefordiffractionstudy,whileamorphousmate-
rials like glass appear dark in all orientations. Other conglomerations
of single crystals, including some twins, have regions that extinguish in

different orientations instead of a uniform behaviour. The exceptions to
these generalizations are tetragonal, trigonal and hexagonal (‘uniaxial’)
crystals viewed down their unique high-symmetry axis, and cubic crys-
tals viewed in any direction; these are uniformly dark, though uniaxial
crystals should become bright if tipped away from the principal axis.
4.3
Metric symmetry and Laue symmetry
Once the unit cell parameters have been determined, the crystal sys-
tem can usually be selected. It is, however, possible for the unit cell
to show higher metric symmetry than expected, because of fortuitous
equality (within experimental uncertainties) of parameters, or angles
that are close to special values not required by the true symmetry. One
example is a monoclinic cell with a β angle close to 90◦. From the unit
cell parameters alone, this could be taken as orthorhombic, since all the
angles are 90◦. Similarly, an orthorhombic cell with two almost equal
axis lengths appears to be tetragonal. For this reason it is important to
examine the intensities of groups of reﬂections that should be equiva-
lent for the assumed symmetry. Such reﬂections may be present in the
initial set of data from which the unit cell was determined, or they may
be investigated speciﬁcally at this stage. A ﬁnal conﬁrmation of the true
Laue symmetry (the symmetry of the diffraction pattern with respect to
both geometry and intensities) is best obtained after the complete data
set has been collected.
It is also necessary to examine the intensities of related reﬂections
in order to choose between the two possible Laue classes for each of
the four higher symmetry crystal systems. These account, however, for
only a few per cent of structures of molecular materials, so this will not
need to be done very often. Likewise, primitive trigonal and hexagonal
unit cells can not be distinguished on the basis of their geometry, and
intensities of supposedly equivalent reﬂections must be considered.
Possible problems with this procedure include effects that make
symmetry-equivalent reﬂections have different intensities, particularly
strong absorption for crystals with extreme shapes and/or containing
heavy atoms. Since many absorption correction methods are based on
the measurement of equivalent reﬂections, this can be rather a circular
argument, but in most cases a self-consistent result will be obtained if
there are enough intensity data available to test the various symmetry
possibilities. Final decisions should not be made until a complete data
set has been measured.
4.4
Unit cell contents
Once the unit cell parameters are known, some assessment can be made
of the probable contents of the cell, at least in terms of the number of
atoms and molecules it can accommodate. If the density of the crystals
has been measured, then the mass contents of one unit cell are easily

44
Space-group determination
found from the cell volume (density = mass/volume), and the result
can be compared with the proposed molecular mass for the compound.
D = MZ/N0V
Here, D is the density, M the molecular mass, Z the number of molecules
in each unit cell, N0 Avogadro’s number, and V the unit cell volume. It is
important, of course, to work with consistent units in these calculations!
The usual approach is to calculate Z from the assumed value of M
and the measured cell volume. If all is correct, this should be a whole
number appropriate to the symmetry of the crystal system (common
values are 1 or 2 for triclinic, 2, 4 or 8 for monoclinic, multiples of 4 for
orthorhombic and tetragonal, and numbers with factors of 3 or 6 for
other systems, unless individual molecules themselves can be of high
symmetry and lie on special positions). Failure to obtain a result close
to an integer, or an inappropriate value such as 5 or 7, demonstrates
that the assumed value of the molecular mass is incorrect. This may be
due to the presence of the solvent of crystallization, which has not been
included in the overall molecular mass and leads to too high a value of
Z, or it may be because the compound is not as expected! Sometimes this
simple calculation helps avoid wasting time measuring the diffraction
pattern of a known starting material or uninteresting decomposition
product, but often the experiment proceeds anyway, in order to ﬁnd out
just what the material really is.
If the density has not been measured, a rather more approximate cal-
culation can be made on the basis of an observation that, for a wide
range of organic, organometallic and co-ordination compounds, each
non-hydrogen atom in the unit cell requires an average volume of 18
Å3; in some areas of chemistry a different value may pertain, and this
is a matter of experience. Thus, the number of non-hydrogen atoms per
unit cell can be estimated, and hence the number of molecules Z.
Comparison of the value of Z with the order of a point group (Table 5),
in some cases, provides preliminary information about possible space
groups within those associated with a particular Laue class, and may
indicate that molecules are likely to lie in special positions, because Z
is a fraction of the number of equivalent general positions. The most
common outcome, however, is just an indication that the proposed
chemical formula, possibly with some added solvent of crystallization,
is compatible with the observed unit cell volume and crystal system.
4.5
Systematic absences
The intensity of each reﬂection in the diffraction pattern is due to inter-
ference of the waves scattered from individual atoms in that particular
direction; the greater the degree to which atoms scatter in phase with
each other, the higher is the intensity resulting from superposition of
the waves with crests approximately aligned. The extent to which atoms

4.5
Systematic absences
45
scatter in phase or out of phase relative to each other depends on their
positions in the unit cell. For atoms that are related to each other by
symmetry, the scattering effects are also related. In some cases this
leads to either completely in-phase or strictly out-of-phase combinations
of waves of equal amplitude; the former gives strong reinforcement,
while the latter leads to a net contribution of zero from these atoms.
At the fundamental level, of course, this is the explanation of the phe-
nomenon of discrete diffraction maxima for X-rays scattered by single
crystals: there is zero intensity in all directions except those given by
the standard diffraction conditions as expressed in the reciprocal lattice
and the Bragg equation, resulting from the pure translation symmetry
of the crystal lattice. Similar effects, in selected parts of the diffrac-
tion pattern, are due to other symmetry elements involving translation
components.
For a lattice described by a primitive unit cell, the diffraction pattern
consists of reﬂections lying at the points of a primitive reciprocal lattice
related in a well-deﬁned way to the crystal lattice. These reﬂections
have a range of intensities. What happens if a centred unit cell (A, B
or C) is chosen instead of the primitive one, for the same lattice? This
unit cell is twice the size of the original one, so the reciprocal unit cell is
half the size and hence describes a reciprocal lattice with twice as many
points. However, the structure itself has not changed as a result of this
arbitrary choice of axes describing it, and so the diffraction pattern also
remains the same in appearance. Therefore, half of the reciprocal lattice
points for the new description do not lie on observed reﬂections; the
intensities of these predicted ‘reﬂections’ are exactly zero, and they are
called systematic absences. Which reﬂections are systematically absent
is dictated by the choice of axes made in forming the centred unit cell,
i.e. on the nature of the centring (A, B or C).
Each type of unit cell centring (also called lattice centring, though this
is not really correct) has an associated pattern of systematic absences
from which it can be uniquely identiﬁed. These are shown in Table 4.1.
It is from these observed systematic absences in a diffraction pattern
that the cell centring is identiﬁed as part of unit cell and space-group
determination. In this and later tables, in the conditions for observed
intensity, n is any integer (positive, zero or negative), so 2n just means
any even number. Thus, for example, for a reﬂection to be observed for
a body-centred unit cell, the sum of all three indices must be even; if the
sum is odd, the reﬂection has zero intensity.
Centred unit cells produce systematic absences right through the
whole data set; the conditions in Table 4.1 apply to all reﬂections. Sys-
tematic absences in selected parts of the diffraction pattern are observed
when glide planes and screw axes are present in a structure, because
of the translation components of these symmetry elements. If a glide
plane is viewed ‘face on’, perpendicular to its reﬂection, and heights
of atoms above and below this plane are ignored, the unit cell in pro-
jection appears to be centred (for n glide) or halved in one dimension
(for a, b or c glide), so this produces appropriate systematic absences in

reﬂections whose intensities contain no information about the heights
of atoms perpendicular to the plane. The effect is to remove half the
reﬂections within one two-dimensional section (one sheet or zone) of
the three-dimensional diffraction pattern; in almost all cases observed
in practice these are sets of reﬂections with one index equal to zero. The
complete set of possible systematic absences for glide planes is given in
Table 4.2. The last two rows apply only in the higher-symmetry crys-
tal systems; in the cubic system, the two directions [101] and [011] are
equivalent to [110] and give similar effects.
A similar argument applies for screw axes. In this case, systematic
absences occur for just one row of reﬂections, usually with two indices
equal to zero. Table 4.3 gives the possibilities for screw axes parallel to
each of the unit cell axes (there are other possible directions in higher-
symmetry systems). The recognition of a screw axis from systematic

absences is based on only a few reﬂections and so is less reliable than
spotting glide planes and centred unit cells.
The presence or absence of pure rotation, improper rotation, pure
reﬂection, and inversion symmetry cannot be detected from systematic
absences, as these symmetry elements have no translation components.
Some space groups can be uniquely determined from the Laue sym-
metry and systematic absences. Fortunately, these include the two
common space groups P21/c (alternative settings P21/n and P21/a by
different choices of cell axes) and P212121 as well as several other rea-
sonably common space groups. In other cases two or more space groups
give the same systematic absences and other information is needed in
order to choose among them.
4.6
The statistical distribution of intensities
Although symmetry elements without a translation component do not
cause systematic absences, they do have an effect on the distribution
of intensities, which may be detected by a statistical analysis of how
the intensities are distributed about their mean value. Such tests are
based on a number of assumptions and approximations and must be
used with due caution. At best they indicate only that something is
probably true, not a certainty. In particular, the tests assume an essen-
tially random arrangement of electron density in the unit cell apart
from the symmetry elements being tested, so a structure containing
atoms with widely different numbers of electrons (except for hydrogen
atoms, which contribute only very weakly to X-ray diffraction) or with
non-crystallographic molecular symmetry may lead to either unclear or
incorrect conclusions.
Statistical tests are not made with the intensities themselves, or even
with the amplitudes derived from them. Just as for direct methods of
structure determination, the amplitudes are converted to ‘normalized
amplitudes’, otherwise known as E-values. These represent what the
amplitudes would be for point atoms at rest instead of vibrating atoms
of ﬁnite size. The derivation of E-values from intensities and ampli-
tudes is described in Chapter 10. They are deﬁned in such a way that
the mean value of |E|2 is 1 for all data and should also be 1 for subsets
of the data at different values of sinθ. However, the presence or absence
of an inversion centre in the crystal structure affects the distribution of

48

E-values about their mean. With no inversion symmetry, particularly
in the space group P1, E-values do not vary much from their mean,
and the diffraction pattern does not show much variation in intensities.
When there is inversion symmetry present, atoms are in pairs related
by the inversion, and their combined scattering tends to give a greater
proportion of strong reﬂections and weak reﬂections, so that intensities
show more variation overall. The theoretical probability of a reﬂection
having a particular value of |E|, P(E), is quite different in the two cases,
as shown in Fig. 4.1. The two distributions are called acentric and cen-
tric; these are statistical terms describing the distribution of numerical
values, and should not be confused with and used interchangeably with
the terms non-centrosymmetric and centrosymmetric, which apply to
geometrical arrangements, for example of atoms in crystal structures.
The actual distribution of E-values in a particular data set can be
presented in a variety of ways. The most widely used is probably the
simplest: calculation of the mean value of ||E|2−1| for all the data, giving
a single value. This tends to be close to 0.74 for an acentric and 0.97 for a
centric distribution of intensities, so values close to these are indicative
of the probable absence or presence, respectively, of inversion symmetry.
A similar treatment can be made for rotation axes and mirror planes
by using an appropriate subset of the data and looking for an acentric
or centric distribution. However, with far fewer reﬂections in the set of
data being examined, these are not generally very reliable, and they are
not often used.
4.7
Other points
Even with examination of the Laue symmetry, systematic absences, and
a full statistical analysis of the distribution of intensities, there remain
some space groups that can not be distinguished from each other. These
includeanumberofenantiomorphouspairs,inwhichonespacegroupis
the mirror image of the other and the choice between them speciﬁes the
handedness of the structure. They can be distinguished only if the true
handedness is known by other means, or if there is sufﬁcient anomalous
dispersion to show that one ﬁts the diffraction data signiﬁcantly better

than the other, in which case the ﬁnal choice of space group is not made
until structure reﬁnement is well advanced.
There are also two other pairs of space groups for which the correct
choice can only be made by seeing which leads to successful struc-
ture solution and reﬁnement. These are the orthorhombic pair I222 and
I212121 and the cubic pair I23 and I213. In both cases the two space
groups have the same symmetry elements, but they are arranged dif-
ferently relative to each other in space. These are unusual and subtle
problems!
Various stages of the space-group determination process may be
adversely affected by problems in the data collection. Poor-quality data
can give unreliable statistical tests, can lead to incorrect or uncertain
decisions about the Laue symmetry, and can make it difﬁcult to work
out the correct systematic absences. In particular, some effects such as
multiple diffraction, the presence of wavelength harmonics, or serious
underestimation of standard uncertainties of intensities can make sys-
tematically absent reﬂections appear to have signiﬁcant and even quite
substantial intensities. In such cases, reliance on fully automatic com-
puter programs is particularly dangerous. Dealing with such problems
may involve careful examination of the originally measured data, and
even a partial or complete repeat of the data collection in some instances.
One complicating factor in space-group determination, and in crystal-
structure determination overall, is the occurrence of pseudo-symmetry.
In some structures there is an approximation to symmetry that is not
exact; for example, two molecules not quite identical and with rela-
tive positions corresponding approximately to centring of the unit cell.
Pseudo-symmetry can lead to various problems and ambiguities, such
as metric symmetry higher than the Laue symmetry, sets of reﬂections
thatwouldhaveexactlyzerointensityinrecognizedsystematicabsences
but are weak rather than completely missing, and mean ||E|2 −1| values
intermediate between the centric and acentric ideals. Sometimes this
means the structure can be solved in more than one space group, at
least for the location of some of the atoms, and the pseudo-symmetry is
broken only when further atoms are found.
Some cases of metric symmetry higher than the Laue symmetry (and
some other fortuitous rational geometrical relationships among unit
cell parameters) can lead to unit cells being stacked together in the
wrong orientations during the formation of a crystal, so that the result
is a combination of two different orientations of the same structure in
one apparently single crystal. This means the diffraction patterns of
the two components are superimposed. This effect is called twinning.
Sometimes it is obvious that the observed diffraction pattern can not be
associated with a single-crystal lattice, but in other cases the reﬂections
of the two components coincide. Depending on the precise nature of the
twinning and the space group of the material, this may lead to some
strange patterns of zero intensities, because systematic absences of one
component overlap permitted reﬂections of the other. The resolution of
such problems requires some skill and experience.

50
Space-group determination
There are also cases where a structure can be described either with
disorder in a particular space group or ordered in a lower-symmetry
space group (lacking a symmetry element of inversion, reﬂection or pure
rotation, which are not indicated by systematic absences). The correct
choice is not always easy to make, though it is generally accepted that
the higher symmetry, which usually has fewer parameters, is preferred
unless there are strong indications otherwise. Certainly, if the lower-
symmetry description involves unusual molecular geometry distortions
or requires extensive use of reﬁnement constraints or restraints, it is
probably wrong.
Finally, it should be noted that the ultimate demonstration of the cor-
rect assignment of a space group is the successful reﬁnement of the
structure with no untoward features. The fact that an initial structure
solution can be obtained in a lower-symmetry space group and not in
a higher one does not prove that the lower symmetry is correct; the
removal of inversion symmetry in particular gives direct methods pro-
grams much more freedom in their calculation of reﬂection phases.
The possible missing symmetry should be looked for carefully in the
structure solution. Various programs exist that can take a partial or com-
pleted structure and examine it for evidence of additional symmetry not
noticed by the experimenter, allowing for a revised assessment and fur-
ther reﬁnement in the higher-symmetry space group. Probably the best
developed and most used of these is PLATON by A. L. Spek of Utrecht
University, The Netherlands. Pseudo-symmetry can also be detected
and explored in this way.

A brief conducted tour of some entries
in International Tables for
Crystallography, Volume A
The International Tables for Crystallography are important standard refer-
ence works for practising crystallographers. Volume A is all about space
group symmetry – over 800 pages of detailed information including a
variety of representations and properties of each of the 230 space groups,
some of them in alternative axis settings and orientations (for example,
the alternatives P21/c, P21/a and P21/n, and both primitive and obverse-
centred choices for rhombohedral space groups). It should be noted that
there is a much shorter volume of selected space groups available as a
“teaching edition”, with helpful notes, as Brief teaching edition of Volume
A: Space-group symmetry. It currently costs about £17 from the IUCr or
Springer.
Among the information are the following:
1) headings including the space group symbols in both international
and (not very useful) Schoenﬂies notation, the former in conven-
tional short form and also in a full form where this is different;

4.8

51
this full form makes explicit the association of symmetry elements
with particular crystallographic axes;
2) projections of the unit cell along different axes, with the positions of
the various symmetry elements, and a separate projection showing
the effect of the symmetry operations on a molecule in a general
position;
3) information about possible choices of origin and the size of the
asymmetric unit in terms of a fraction of the unit cell;
4) a list of the symmetry-related general positions (in a form that is
used by many crystallographic computer programs to represent
the space group symmetry), together with lists of all the special
positions (in which molecules lie on symmetry elements), with
their multiplicities (Z values) and point group symmetry;
5) the systematic absences (actually expressed as positive conditions
for reﬂections to occur, not negative ones for their absence) for the
space group, and also those that arise for atoms in special positions;
6) various information about the symmetry of two-dimensional
projections and of subgroups and supergroups.
In the lists of general positions, it is quite easy to work out which
are generated by different kinds of symmetry elements. In the three
crystal systems of lowest symmetry (no rotation symmetry higher than
two-fold), the presence of one minus sign before any of x, y and z in a
general position indicates reﬂection; two minus signs indicate rotation,
and three minus signs indicate inversion. Fractions added to x, y or z
areamarkeroftranslationalcomponentsofsymmetryelements(centred
unit cells, glide planes and screw axes). If any of x, y or z occurs without
any negative signs in front of it in the list of general positions, this is a
polar axis.

Introduction
This chapter takes the reader through the theoretical fundamentals
behind data collection and reduction methods for single-crystal struc-
ture determination. The descriptions are directed towards those using
area-detector diffractometers, since these are now almost the only ones
available commercially and are installed in many laboratories. How-
ever, a large part of the theory may still be relevant to older types of
diffractometers.
A step-wise theoretical journey through an experiment is ﬁrst pre-
sented, to illustrate the need for alternating real and reciprocal space
thinking at different parts of an experiment. There follows a discussion
of the geometry of X-ray diffraction in both real and reciprocal space, the
sequence of procedures required to determine a unit cell, data-collection
methodologies and strategies, a description of the data-integration pro-
cess for diffractometers housing a standard ﬂat-plate two-dimensional
area detector, and the subsequent data-reduction corrections that are
necessary to afford a list of intensities or structure factors, the starting
point for data solution and reﬁnement.

A step-wise theoretical journey through
an experiment
The sequence of events that comprise an X-ray diffraction experiment
is in many ways analogous to that of a microscopic investigation, as
Fig. 5.1 illustrates.
When a sufﬁciently intense and collimated source of photons is
directed at a small crystal, an inverted image of the form of that crys-
tal can be collected on a lens or detector placed on the opposite side
of the crystal. The wavelength of the photon source will dictate the
scale of the contents of this image: an optical source (λ ∼1 μm) will

present a microscopic inverted view of the exposed part of the crystal,
whilst an X-ray beam (λ ∼10−10 m = 1 Å) will reveal an inverted image
of the exposed part of the crystal on the Ångstrom scale, i.e. the scale
corresponding to the size of atoms. Where X-ray diffraction (rather than
absorption) occurs, the diffracted image will represent the average view
of the contents of many unit cells in a reciprocal form, given the periodic
nature of single crystals. Such an image would normally comprise many
spots, their relative location on the image providing information about
the unit cell, whilst their intensities contain all of the information about
the relative positions of all atoms within the unit cell.
In the case of an optical microscope, the retina in the human eye pro-
vides a natural image-inversion process so that one can readily obtain a
real-space interpretation of an optically inverted image, simply by view-
ing the optical lens that captured the image via objective lens with an
appropriate magniﬁcation.
Realizing a real-space view of the diffracted part of an X-ray image is
an entirely different matter, however; only ﬁctional characters have ‘X-
ray eyes’ and even they could not oblige due to the irradiation damage
that they would sustain from putting their head in the X-ray beam!
An X-ray-sensitive detector, whether this is photographic ﬁlm or an
electronic device, can be used to obtain the reciprocal diffraction image.
The positions and intensities of diffraction spots can therefore be ascer-
tained. However, with no ‘X-ray eye retina’, this information still needs
to be converted from reciprocal to real space.Acalculation, in the form of
a Fourier transformation, is needed to make this conversion. It requires
the ‘structure factor’, F, of each spot on the image. The square of the
structure factor, F2, is proportional to the intensity of a spot, which is
measurable, and so the amplitude |F| can be evaluated. The phase of

each F (the sign for centrosymmetric structures) cannot be found by a
normal experiment, however, since spot intensities do not directly carry
phase information: there is no way of knowing the phase of an X-ray
beam as it meets the detector. All intensities are positive. The phase of F
is crucial, however, since the Fourier transform is based implicitly on a
summation involving F. Later chapters in this book concerning structure
solution explain how one can overcome this so-called ‘phase problem’.
Once solved, the required conversion from reciprocal to real space can
be undertaken to reveal the real-space representation of a unit cell, in
the form of an electron-density map.
This virtual journey through an experiment not only illustrates the
analogy of an ‘X-ray microscope’ but hopefully also shows that one
needs to look at the different stages of an experiment with different
space concepts. The physical experiment itself, comprising the sample
and the diffractometer, obviously exists in real space. The X-rays are
ﬁred at the crystal in real space. The diffraction patterns observed by
the detector represent reciprocal space images of the crystal structure
of the sample. Each spot, or ‘reﬂection’, in a diffraction pattern can
be identiﬁed uniquely by Miller indices, or hkl values. Such indices,
described in detail later, are therefore reciprocal space quantities, as
are their associated structure factors. The goal of all subsequent data
integration and reduction stages is to obtain the magnitudes (ampli-
tudes) of the structure factors of each diffraction spot, via the square
root of their measured intensities, corrected for various deﬁned geo-
metrical and physical effects. With these in hand, one can then consider
the Fourier-transformation calculation to obtain the desired real-space
view of a molecule via an electron-density map.
5.3
The geometry of X-ray diffraction
X-ray waves interact with electrons in a material. X-ray diffraction
occurs when a crystal is oriented towards incoming X-ray waves, of a
suitable wavelength (λ), such that the waves interfere non-destructively
between ordered rows of electronic concentration (layers of atoms) in
the crystal that are of a suitable separation (d).
The condition for diffraction can be deﬁned mathematically by
Bragg’s law or geometrically by the Ewald sphere construction, in real
or reciprocal space, respectively.

5.3.1
Real-space considerations: Bragg’s law
Bragg’s law states that nλ = 2d sin θ. λ and d have been deﬁned above
and θ is the angle between a plane of atoms and the line of the diffracted
(or incident) beam; n is an integer. Therefore, diffraction occurs only for
certain combinations of d, λ and θ. The variation of d, whilst keeping λ
and θ approximately constant, results in differing magnitudes of diffrac-
tion by two lattice planes in one dimension, as illustrated in Fig. 5.2; here,

56
Background theory for data collection
where incident X-ray waves are 100% in-phase (d = 4) the maximum
amount of diffraction occurs, whilst 100% out-of-phase (d = 2) will pre-
clude diffraction; 75% in-phase waves result from d = 3 and so affords a
moderate amount of diffraction.
Two X-ray waves diffracted from a plane will have a difference in
path length, necessarily depending on d. One may notice in Fig. 5.2, for
example, that the 100% in-phase interference of two waves has a path
difference that corresponds to exactly one wavelength. Indeed, there
exists a general relationship that the maximum amount of diffraction
between two points occurs at a value of d where the path difference
between two waves is an integral multiple of the X-ray wavelength, nλ.
This multiplier, n, is the same integer used in Bragg’s law.
Given that there are many parallel planes in a crystal, and that the
diffraction condition needs to be satisﬁed in three dimensions simul-
taneously rather than in one as presented here, in practice diffraction
is observed only where n is an integer. In nearly all cases of conven-
tional X-ray diffraction, one can consider that n = 1, since one can
always divide d by n if it is greater than 1, in order to obtain a value
of d corresponding to n = 1.
The value of d that corresponds to 100% in-phase diffraction, in each
of the three-dimensional basis-set vectors being used, is represented by
vectors that relate to a, b and c and integers h, k and l, respectively,
where a, b and c represent the unit cell parameters and the integers are
the reciprocal-space (hkl) indices. Therefore, in practice, one can say that
λ = 2dhkl sin θ.
In conventional crystal-structure determination, our aim is to collect
as many unique diffraction spots, hkl, as possible within the practical
bounds of time available. The variation of d represents the orientation of
a crystal with respect to the incident X-ray beam, and ideally we would
want to collect diffraction data for all possible orientations of a crystal for
a three-dimensional crystal-structure determination. In an experiment,
d is therefore usually varied, whilst keeping λ constant (X-ray sources
in a laboratory are monochromatic and λ is selected by the type of X-ray
tube installed on an instrument) and stepping through θ incrementally
to collect the data since 2θ, the net scattering angle, represents the angle
of the detector centre relative to the incident X-ray beam, 2θ = 0◦being
the straight-through beam.
5.3.2
Reciprocal-space considerations: the
Ewald sphere
Since the diffraction patterns that we observe in an experiment relate to
reciprocal space, a geometrical construct of a reciprocal space version
of Bragg’s law is often useful in interpreting such patterns. The Ewald
sphere, illustrated in Fig. 5.3(a), provides this construct: the sample lies
at the centre of a sphere whose radius is the reciprocal of the wavelength
(1/λ); the diffraction condition is met when a spot touches the surface of
this sphere. With an incident X-ray beam traversing the horizontal from

one side of the sphere, transmitted X-rays simply continue to the other
side of the sphere, whereupon the beam meets the surface to satisfy the
diffraction condition for the (000) reﬂection that corresponds to F(000).
This reﬂection is always calculated rather than measured because the
beamstop necessarily obscures the transmitted X-ray beam from the
detector. Indeed, even if it could be measured, the (000) reﬂection would
be contaminated with undiffracted direct beam and so such an intensity
measurement would be inaccurate. The (000) reﬂection is referenced as
the origin of reciprocal space.
Where diffraction occurs, one can draw a vector from the crystal centre
to the surface of the Ewald sphere that subtends an angle, 2θ, (the net
scattering angle) to the vector representing the transmitted X-ray beam.
The point thus generated on the surface of the sphere corresponds to
a reﬂection, hkl, and the chord that links this point with the reciprocal
lattice origin has a length 1/d, where d is the lattice spacing for that
reﬂection.
As the crystal is rotated during a diffraction experiment, different
lattice planes are exposed to the incident X-ray beam, and so different
reﬂections intersect the surface of the sphere, i.e. diffract. Figure 5.3(b)
shows an illustrative example of a rotating lattice plane of reﬂections,
where diffraction at that time-captured moment derives from the (101)
reﬂection.
A very useful demonstration of an Ewald sphere simulation is given
by Proffen and Neder (2008b).
One can use the Ewald sphere construct to interpret geometrically the
patterns of spots appearing on successive frames of diffraction during
data collection.
If one has determined the unit cell parameters of a crystal within the
diffractometer frame of reference (see Section 5.5), one can also calculate
the hkl indices of each spot in a diffraction pattern using the appropriate

equation in Table 5.1, thus uniquely identifying each reﬂection as one
collects data.
The ability to identify each reﬂection means that one can also predict
where all diffraction spots will appear in frames of data. This enables the
experimenter to manipulate the diffraction geometry, via diffractometer
control programs, to perform various functions: ‘dial-up’ certain reﬂec-
tions, lattice planes, time-optimize data collection strategies, and so on.
5.4
Determining the unit cell: the
indexing process
There are two principal methods that are used to determine a unit
cell: a real-space method, called ‘autoindexing’; and a reciprocal-space
method. Both methods follow a similar common procedure in that they
determine the unit cell using a small portion of diffraction data taken
from different parts of reciprocal space, and their methodology follows
the generic ﬂow-diagram below (Fig. 5.4).
5.4.1
Indexing: a conceptual view
If one possessed data that corresponded to every possible diffraction
spot in a sufﬁciently large volume of reciprocal space, one could simply
calculate the lattice spacings for each reﬂection in real space and thence
build up a three-dimensional grid of periodic lattice points. This grid
would contain a repeat motif, which one could identify by observation,

and that would represent the unit cell of the sample in hand (e.g. see
Fig. 5.5a).
Realizing such a situation is not practical when initially indexing a
crystal and so one relies, instead, on utilizing a small portion of data
collected selectively from several small volumes of reciprocal space that
together will afford a representative derivation of a partial lattice in
three dimensions. Whilst such a representation is rather ‘patchy’ (e.g.
see Fig. 5.5b), as long as there are enough parts of the lattice to indicate
all three unit cell parameters and corroborate them, one should be able
to determine the correct unit cell of any subject material, assuming that
the sample is a good-quality single crystal.
This is a rather conceptual view of indexing, but hopefully is a help-
ful one. In practice, one works largely with a comparison of vectors as
described in the next section. That said, one can often gain an insight
into the likely unit cell parameters by simply observing the frames of
data collected for indexing purposes: if many diffraction spots are close

60

together along one direction, one would expect a long unit cell parame-
ter in the corresponding real-space dimension. This may indicate a unit
cell of a certain crystal system and thus put constraints upon some of
their parameters.
5.4.2
Indexing procedure
Detailed accounts of each of the two principal indexing methods can be
found in many articles (Hornstra and Vossers, 1974; Clegg, 1984; Sparks,
1976, 1982; Kabsch, 1993). However, it is instructive to consider here
the basic generic procedure behind each method, via a ﬂow diagram
(Fig. 5.4) with an associated description. The ﬁrst step has already been
discussed in the previous section.
Each of the two indexing methodologies uses a core set of vectors, x,
thatcorrespondtothereciprocallatticepointsobservedinthediffraction
patterns selectively collected for indexing purposes. In the reciprocal-
space method, this core set of vectors is augmented by summative or
difference vectors generated from combinations of these initial vectors,
xi±xj; the same difference vectors are often added to the vector set in the
real-spacemethodaswell,particularlywhereoneanticipatesalargeunit
cell. In each case, the three shortest non-coplanar vectors for this list are
then identiﬁed and used to deﬁne an initial cell, in the form of reciprocal
cell axes or a real-space trial unit cell. Whilst such a trial solution does
not usually correspond to the true unit cell, it will represent a subcell of
the true unit cell.

5.4
Determining the unit cell: the indexing process
61
By assimilating this trial cell to the true unit cell, one can calculate a
trial (hkl) index for each of the core set of vectors, via the usual mathe-
matical equations for a given predicted crystal system, as described in
Table 5.1, Section 5.3.2, or via analogous reciprocal space axis relations.
This affords a trial list of uniquely identiﬁed reﬂections that one can use
to test the validity of the trial unit cell: the true unit cell must gener-
ate only integral values of h, k and l, for all reﬂections in this list, by
the fundamental nature of Miller indices. One can readily tell if all (hkl)
assignments approximate to integral quantities by simply observing the
list of (hkl) values. In practice, one rarely ﬁnds all (hkl) values perfectly
integral due to experimental error, spurious reﬂections, i.e. reﬂections
that derive from alien reciprocal lattices, or instrumental artefacts, but
one should expect most h, k and l values to be near-integer quantities if
the trial cell corresponds to the primitive form of the true unit cell.
If the bulk of h, k or l values approximate to simple fractions, this
may indicate that one cell parameter corresponding to this index is a
corresponding multiple of the true cell parameter. In this case, there will
exist a common multiplier (2, 3, 4 . . . ) that will afford a list of integral
hkl reﬂections when one multiplies the appropriate one of the trial unit
cell parameters, a, b or c, by this common multiplier. Simple fractions
are often observed when the three unit cell lengths are highly disparate.
If most reﬂections have non-integral hkl values, however, and there
is no obvious numerical relationship between them, indexing fails with
this core set of vectors. There are various options to consider in this
scenario. Four of the most common approaches are: (i) create a new
core set of vectors by collecting a new set of reﬂections from the same
crystal and repeat the indexing process; (ii) re-index using a subset of the
existing data set, typically only strong reﬂections deﬁned by an intensity
threshold; (iii) try another indexing method; (iv) select a new crystal for
the experiment.
Where one is able to generate a list of integral hkl values, the trial
cell can be considered to be the primitive form of the true unit cell,
which will equate to the true unit cell if that is primitive. Alternatively,
the true cell may possess higher metric symmetry. In order to ascertain
the full metric symmetry of the sample, one ﬁrst performs a full-matrix
least-squares reﬁnement on the reﬂection list, to remove any spurious
or ill-deﬁned reﬂections. Then one can determine if systematic absences
are revealed that indicate a centred unit cell. If no centring is found by an
automated procedure, it can be judicious to double-check for centring
by considering the Laue symmetry. The metric symmetry can never be
lower than the Laue symmetry but it can be higher. By checking the Laue
symmetry one can, for example, identify ostensibly centred monoclinic
cells that are really triclinic, or rhombohedral cells masquerading as
monoclinic ones. In cases where one can not be certain if the unit cell is
centred or not, at the indexing stage of data collection, one must always
undertake a data-collection strategy that assumes the lower-symmetry
crystal system. This is because, if higher symmetry is conﬁrmed post-
data collection (Laue symmetry is more easily distinguishable with a

62
Background theory for data collection
full data set), equivalent reﬂections can be merged to afford a more
reliable unique data set that one would otherwise have had. However,
the converse is an unhelpful outcome: collecting data assuming too high
a crystal system initially is likely to render a dataset useless because it
lacks key unique data from whole segments of reciprocal space (see
Section 5.6.1).
5.5
Relating diffractometer angles to unit
cell parameters: determination
of the orientation matrix
Amodern-day area-detector-based diffractometer will typically possess
three or four independent motors that, together, are able to drive the
crystal sample into nearly any orientation with respect to the incident
X-ray beam. The associated angular degrees of freedom for each motor
are usually called φ, 2θ, ω, and κ, where φ represents the rotation of the
sample about the vertical axis of the goniometer head, 2θ represents
the movement of the detector relative to the incident X-ray beam, ω
concerns the rotation of the base of the diffractometer about its physical
vertical axis and is usually constrained to ‘bisecting geometry’, whereby
2θ = ω, and κ is the motor that provides vertical tilt of the goniometer
head. Figure 5.6 illustrates these deﬁnitions in geometrical terms.
The angular positions of each motor must be deﬁned relative to a
ﬁxed origin; the x, y, z diffractometer axes provide the co-ordinate basis
set for this purpose. By convention, the z-axis is usually deﬁned to be
coincident with the diffractometer φ-axis. x and y are deﬁned arbitrarily
to complete a right-handed set; the deﬁnitions are not the same for all

types of diffractometer, but whatever their deﬁnition, they necessarily
allow a formula to deﬁne ω, 2θ and κ in terms of x, y and z.
In order that these motors can be used to ‘dial up’ any (hkl) reﬂection
during an experiment, one needs to be able to relate the diffractometer
axes, x, y, z, that the motors are deﬁned upon, with the axes that deﬁne
a diffraction pattern for a given sample: the unit cell reciprocal axes;
thence, one can calculate h, k, l. A 3 × 3 matrix, called the ‘orientation
matrix’, enables this relation:
x = A h,
where x and h represent the vectors, (x, y, z) and (h, k, l), respectively,
and A is the orientation matrix deﬁned by:
A =

⎠,
the nine elements of this matrix representing the components of the
reciprocal cell axes on each axis, x, y and z. See Fig. 5.7 for an illustration
of these axes and relationships.
These matrix elements also contain information about the unit cell
(requiring six parameters) and orientation of the crystal (three parame-
ters). Thus, where required, the unit cell parameters can be extracted:
(A′A)−1 =

where A′ is the transpose of the orientation matrix, A.
These interconversions also prove very useful when carried out in
reverse using the inverse of the orientation matrix; for example, during
the previously mentioned indexing procedure, where one wished to

Data-collection procedures
and strategies
5.6.1
Criteria for selecting which data to collect
The Fourier transform calculation, that permits the reciprocal-space to
real-space conversion of structure factors into electron-density maps
of crystal structures, requires, in principle, an inﬁnite number of data.
Naturally, such a requirement is not possible to achieve experimentally.
However, one can collect sufﬁcient data to render such a calculation
viable; one usually collects data up to a certain value in 2θ (typically 2θ =
50◦with Mo radiation) beyond which the intensities, and therefore the
structure-factor magnitudes, are so low that one can approximate them
to zero for all unmeasured data. Thus, the Fourier-transform calculation
can still be provided with values effectively up to inﬁnity. That said,
since a series of zero-valued terms will have null effect on an integral, in
practice one actually approximates the true integral, with inﬁnite limits,
to a summation with ﬁnite limits in h, k, l corresponding to the maximum
values of h, k, l, collected in a dataset.
The more data collected, the better this approximation. The standard
2θ = 50◦cut-off threshold for data collection usually proves entirely
satisfactory for most crystal-structure determinations. Occasionally, one
may wish to collect further in 2θ, if one perhaps wanted a particularly
precise crystal-structure determination. Conversely, one might collect
data with a lower 2θ cut-off threshold, where the intensity of diffraction
spots becomes negligible before this default limit, 2θ = 50◦, is reached,
as, for example, occurs commonly where structural disorder is present.
Data-collection time restraints may also affect this default threshold
choice, for example, if the unit cell is very large and so it would take
too much time to collect sufﬁcient data up to 2θ = 50◦; alternatively, if
the crystal is decaying over time, it would be prudent to collect all data
as fast as possible.
Crystals diffract in all directions and so it is important to collect
diffraction data over a wide proportion of the scattering sphere. How-
ever, if one knows the crystal symmetry of a structure, one may not need
to collect data through the complete 360◦since a diffraction pattern may
be replicated in octants, quadrants or hemispheres of this total sphere.
Indeed, a full sphere of data would be required only if the sample pos-
sessed a non-centrosymmetric triclinic crystal structure. Where Friedel’s
law applies, half of a diffraction pattern should be equivalent to its other
half if the crystal structure is centrosymmetric. Thus, only a hemisphere
of data need be collected to obtain all unique data if one knew that

5.6
Data-collection procedures and strategies
65
a structure was centrosymmetric and triclinic. The Laue symmetry in
other crystal systems, in combination with Friedel’s law, dictates what
fraction of the total sphere will contain all of the unique reﬂections. For
example, in the monocliniccrystal system,onequadrantofdatawillcon-
tain all unique reﬂections for a centrosymmetric structure, whilst only an
octant of data needs to be collected for a centrosymmetric orthorhombic
sample to capture all unique data.
One can therefore set up a data-collection schedule that aims to
acquire only the required unique data, according to the crystal sym-
metry of the sample. This said, it is good practice, if time permits,
to collect some duplicate reﬂections, so-called ‘symmetry-equivalents’,
to improve one’s data quality: symmetry-equivalents should have
the same intensity and so can be averaged to provide a more sta-
tistically sound, merged dataset. It is also absolutely crucial, if one
is not sure about the crystal symmetry of the sample before data
collection, to collect data according to the lowest crystal symmetry pos-
sible, since one can always discard or ‘merge’ duplicate data after an
experiment if a sample turns out to possess crystal symmetry higher
than that expected, whereas one cannot restore reﬂections from parts
of the diffraction sphere if they were never collected. The measure-
ment of symmetry-equivalent data is very useful for other reasons in
any case; e.g. conﬁrming crystal symmetry, undertaking absorption
corrections, etc.
With all of these factors in mind, one should then ensure that the order
of reﬂections collected is the most time efﬁcient. Fortunately, commercial
area-detector diffractometers nowadays possess software to calculate
automatically time-optimized schedules for data collection.
5.6.2
How best to measure data: the need
for reﬂection scans
Due to a combination of reasons (e.g. the actual quality of a crystal
sample, the intrinsic resolution of a detector), allhkl reﬂections measured
are not delta functions (inﬁnitely sharp); rather, they have a ﬁnite width.
Therefore, in one dimension, a reﬂection proﬁle would look like one of
the curves in Fig. 5.8. The required intensity of a reﬂection is the area
under this curve. Consequently, one cannot just orient the crystal on
the diffractometer to the calculated 2θ value for a given hkl reﬂection
and measure the diffraction intensity with the crystal kept stationary.
One must rotate the crystal through the calculated position for each
reﬂection as it is measured in order to capture its full intensity. There
are two principal ways that one can scan through a reﬂection when using
an area-detector diffractometer, and in either case, the axis of rotation is
usually ω or φ.
One approach is ‘narrow-frame’ scans: rastering through a reﬂec-
tion in incremental angular steps and building up a peak proﬁle from
the sequential ‘slices’ obtained for each peak. Each frame of data that
one collects using an area-detector diffractometer necessarily provides

a two-dimensional diffraction pattern. Therefore, each spot shown on a
frame of data represents a two-dimensional ‘slice’ of a reﬂection. If one
collects a series of such frames where only one diffractometer motor
is moved, in small angular increments, between the frames of data col-
lected, one can build up a peak proﬁle of each reﬂection on these frames,
assuming that there are sufﬁcient ‘slices’ for each reﬂection observed.
Figure 5.9 illustrates this process.
Alternatively, one can collect the whole intensity of a reﬂection in one
‘wide-angle slice’: sweeping through an angle greater than the angular
spread of a reﬂection whilst acquiring one frame of data.
The decision as to whether to collect data using wide or narrow scans
depends on several factors. One major advantage of wide-angle scans is
the speed of data collection: far fewer frames need to be collected com-
pared with narrow-slice data collection; moreover, both data-acquisition
time and detector read-out time can represent the major contributions to
the overall data-collection time. However, there is limited scope for pro-
ﬁle analysis using wide scans; the accuracy of weak data may therefore
be compromised for data-collection speed. Certainly, if reﬂection pro-
ﬁles need to be analyzed, one must collect data using the narrow-frame
procedure.
When reﬂections appear close together in a diffraction pattern, where
the sample has one or more large unit cell parameters, wide scans may
become problematic, since two reﬂections appearing side-by-side on a
diffraction pattern may be collected in one wide scan and thence inter-
preted as one reﬂection. One may overcome this barrier by extending the
crystal-to-detector distance from its default position; in such cases, how-
ever, two data collections are usually required to obtain the necessary

cerned; the reﬂection thus appears clearly on 6 frames and its proﬁle can be built up by
plotting the 6 discs parallel to each other and interpolating between them to create a sphere

5.7.1
Background subtraction
Detector noise is present in all experimental data and the level of noise
varies from pixel to pixel in an area detector. One must therefore subtract
this from the experimental signal in order to evaluate reliable diffraction
intensities. This is achieved by collecting one frame of ‘data’ with the
X-ray shutter closed so that no signal due to X-ray diffraction can be
present in this frame, only background noise. The data-acquisition time
of this ‘dark frame’ must match that which is proposed for the data-
collection frames. Then, one can simply subtract this dark frame – the
detector counts due to background noise – from each frame measured.

Fig. 5.10 A three-dimensional diffraction spot (left) is measured as 9 slices of two-dimensional data and integrated by summing the
pixel counts in each of these 9 frames (right) and interpolating between them.
5.7.2
Data integration
One extracts intensities from area-detector data via ‘integration’
(Kabsch, 1988). In its simplistic form, this involves the computer sequen-
tially scanning through each frame to build up a 3D image of each
reﬂection, putting a box around this constructed 3D spot, and trying
to ensure that a minimal amount of background is contained within the
box while not windowing out reﬂection intensity. For each reﬂection,
the summation of the detector counts registered in each pixel of the box
(i.e. its integrated volume) yields the intensity of that reﬂection.
Figure 5.10 illustrates this process. For weak reﬂections, it is difﬁcult
to extract the diffraction intensity from the background noise. Because
of this, the computer undertakes the integration process twice – the ﬁrst
time through it integrates all strong reﬂections (‘strong’ is distinguished
from ‘weak’ by a threshold value) and a library of their proﬁles is stored.
All weak reﬂections are simply ﬂagged as weak in this ﬁrst pass of inte-
gration. The integration process is then repeated for the weak reﬂections
with the proﬁles of strong reﬂections close in θ (and therefore resolu-
tion) being used to deﬁne the proﬁles of these weak reﬂections, so as
best to separate their signal from the background (Fig. 5.11). The model
proﬁle shapes are also used to calculate correlation coefﬁcients that can
be used to reject reﬂections.
5.7.3
Crystal and geometric corrections to data
Diffraction intensity for a given hkl reﬂection is directly proportional to
the square of the modulus of the structure factor, F, which is ultimately

what we want to calculate in order to solve a structure. There are various
factors that, when evaluated, allow us to correct the measured intensity
thereby obtaining |F|, according to the equation below.
Ihkl = cL(θ)p(θ)A(θ)E(θ)d(t)m|Fhkl|2.
Some of these factors are angle dependent (vary as a function of θ). Of
these, Lorentz, L(θ), and polarization, p(θ), corrections are entirely geo-
metric corrections, whilst absorption, A(θ), and extinction, E(θ), effects
depend on the material content, crystal size and morphology and, in
the case of extinction, the quality of the crystal sample. Sample decay,
d(t), may occur as a function of time. Multiplicity (m) is relevant only to
powder diffraction and may occur if the crystal symmetry of a material
dictates that certain hkl reﬂections must overlap at a given value of θ.
c is simply a constant used for scaling.
Lorentz correction
A Lorentz correction accounts for the fact that the diffraction from some
lattice planes is measured for a longer time than for others as a result of
the way in which 2θ sweeps through reciprocal space.
The Ewald sphere can be used to visualize this: some reﬂections will
intercept the surface of the Ewald sphere at a more oblique angle than
others, according to the way that the crystal lattice rotates relative to
the detector (2θ). The more obliquely a reﬂection intercepts the Ewald
sphere surface, the longer the condition of diffraction is met for that
reﬂection.
Polarization correction
The polarization correction accounts for the partial polarization of both
the incident X-ray beam by the monochromator and that invoked dur-
ing diffraction within the sample. In the latter case, the amount of

70
Background theory for data collection
polarization is dependent on the value of 2θ and is given by P =
(1 + cos2 2θ)/2, whereas in the former case, the extent of polarization
depends speciﬁcally on the orientation of the monochromator relative
to the equatorial plane of the diffractometer and the physical nature of
the monochromator crystal.
Absorption correction
A sample can absorb rather than diffract some of the X-ray beam. The
level of absorbance, at a given X-ray wavelength, will depend on the
absorption coefﬁcient, μ, of a sample, which depends in turn on its
elemental make-up (heavier elements generally absorb more), and the
path length of X-rays through a crystal, t, according to the equation,
It = I0 exp(−μt). Absorption is also dependent upon the wavelength of
the X-ray source: the longer the wavelength, the greater generally the
absorption coefﬁcient for a given sample.
Extinction correction
An X-ray beam can be diffracted by one lattice plane in a crystal, and
then subsequently scatter off another, in a different part of the crystal.
This effect is known as extinction and it causes a loss of intensity for a
given reﬂection. There are two forms of extinction: primary extinction,
which occurs within a crystal domain if the domains are sufﬁciently
misoriented relative to others; and secondary extinction, which occurs
between domains if they are well oriented with respect to each other.
Secondary extinction is usually the dominant form of extinction, and it
predominantly affects strong, low-angle reﬂections. These are normally
corrected for approximately by including a single correction factor as
a variable in the structure reﬁnement. Secondary extinction is wave-
length dependent, becoming worse with copper than with molybdenum
radiation.
Decay correction
A crystal may degrade over the time of data collection, for example due
to X-ray irradiation damage, chemical reaction of the crystal with air,
moisture or light exposure. In such cases, the expected X-ray intensity
for a given hkl reﬂection decreases over time. Corrections for progres-
sive decay of this type may be undertaken by linear or polynomial curve
ﬁtting of certain reﬂections. This said, it is worth mentioning that with
fast data-collection times made possible by recent area-detector technol-
ogy and increasingly available cryogenic sample-cooling possibilities,
crystal decay is quite rare nowadays.
Apparent crystal decay can also occur if the crystal moves in the X-ray
beam during data collection. One can often correct for such movement
in a similar way.

5.7
Extracting data intensities: data integration and reduction
71
Multiplicity
All lattice planes diffracting at the same Bragg angle will be superim-
posed in a powder X-ray diffraction pattern. This occurs, for example,
in a cubic lattice, dh00 = dh00 = d0k0 = d0k0 = d00l = d00l, therefore
multiplicity is 6 in this case.
Other corrections
Sometimes other effects may need to be accounted for. Particularly
noteworthy are thermal diffuse scattering effects and possible varia-
tions in incident X-ray beam intensity (particularly important in some
synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction experiments).

|Fhkl| can be evaluated for each reﬂection in the dataset. Data reduction is
then complete: the list of resulting h, k, l, and |F| (or |F|2) values is ready

sion into a real-space electron-density model of the crystal structure, via

Introduction
Unlike all other stages of a structure determination, the collection of
diffraction data occurs in real time, requiring the continuous and exclu-
sive use of valuable equipment. Whereas a reﬁnement that has gone
wrong can usually be repeated without causing signiﬁcant delay, an
abandoned or terminally ﬂawed data collection has wasted instrument
time irrevocably. The aim in collecting a dataset should always be to
obtain the best possible quality of data from the available sample within
a reasonable length of time. This requires not only preparing or demand-
ing the best possible crystal, a topic that is covered in Chapter 3, but also
choosing appropriate experimental conditions and parameters.
6.2
Collecting data with area-detector
diffractometers
Until the mid-1990s, nearly all single-crystal data collection for chemi-
cal crystallography applications was carried out using four-circle (serial)
diffractometers. After a slow start when image plate (IP) area-detector
systems made some impact, the ﬁrst commercial area-detector instru-
ments based on charge-coupled devices (CCDs) were introduced in
1994. These have since become widely available from a number of sup-
pliers. They have dropped markedly in price and have now totally
displaced the four-circle instrument as the standard workhorse for data
collection. Having said this, the large installed base of serial instruments
means that, worldwide, they will be a declining source of diffraction
data for some time. The replacement of single-point by area detectors
has brought with it both advantages and disadvantages, but for most
purposes the former greatly outweigh the latter. They are summarized
below.

Practical aspects of data collection
Advantages:
+ simultaneous recording of many reﬂections,
+ faster data collection possible,
+ data-collection time independent of structure size,
+ high redundancy of symmetry-equivalent data possible,
+ rapid screening of samples,
+ not necessary to obtain correct orientation matrix and unit cell
before data collection,
+ complete diffraction pattern measured, not just around Bragg
reﬂection positions,
+ reduced probability of obtaining incorrect cell from a few initially
found reﬂections,
+ poor crystal quality and weaker diffraction can often be tolerated,
+ minimal crystal movement necessary, so easier to use low-
temperature and other accessories,
+ easy visualization of the diffraction pattern, so good for teaching
and training,
+ can obtain data on twinned or incommensurate crystals.
Disadvantages:
−possibly high capital and maintenance costs,
−high computing requirements, especially processing power and
data storage,
−need for careful corrections for non-uniformities and other effects,
−usually poor discrimination against other X-ray wavelengths, e.g.
harmonics,
−restricted detector size may lead to problems with large unit cells
and with Cu Kα X-rays,
−it may be expensive and difﬁcult to change radiation,
−upper limit on counting time per frame for CCD detectors,
−they are not efﬁcient for very small cells.
The major obvious feature of an electronic area detector is its ability to
record diffraction data over a substantial solid angle. As far as normal
Bragg diffraction is concerned, this means the simultaneous measure-
ment of a number of reﬂections: the number of reﬂections measured
simultaneously depends on the size of the unit cell as well as on the size
of the detector. In addition, an area detector actually records the whole of
the intercepted diffraction pattern and not just the Bragg reﬂections (i.e.
the whole of reciprocal space is observed, not just the regions immedi-
ately around each reciprocal lattice point). This can be useful for special
purposes, such as the detection of twinning or the study of incommensu-
rate structures. A related advantage is that it is not actually necessary to
establish the correct unit cell and crystal orientation matrix before begin-
ning data collection – although it is highly advisable to do so whenever
possible – because these can be found later from the stored images. (An
invalid orientation matrix on a four-circle diffractometer usually means
a useless set of data, because only the predicted reﬂection positions are

explored.) A corollary of this is the ability, where deemed necessary, to
re-process stored images using alternative indexing and/or peak proﬁle
parameters.
6.3
Experimental conditions
6.3.1
Radiation
The crystallographer may have some choice over the conditions under
which data are collected and one of these is the wavelength of the
radiation used, the most common choice in the home laboratory being
between copper (1.54184 Å) and molybdenum (0.71073 Å). Copper X-
ray tubes produce a higher ﬂux of incident photons (for the same power
settings) and these are diffracted more efﬁciently than molybdenum
radiation: copper radiation is therefore particularly useful for small or
otherwise weakly diffracting crystals, especially if absorption effects are
moderate. In addition, focusing optics provide greater enhancements
for the longer wavelength. For crystals with long unit cell dimensions,
reﬂections are further apart when the longer-wavelength copper radi-
ation is used and this can minimize reﬂection overlap. If you need to
determine the absolute conﬁguration, and your crystals do not contain
elements heavier than, say, silicon, then copper radiation is essential.
On the other hand, absorption effects are generally less serious with
molybdenum radiation and this can be crucial if elements of high
atomic number are present. Molybdenum radiation allows collection
of data to higher resolution and is likely to cause fewer restrictions if
low-temperature or other attachments are required. Changing radiation
requiressomeeffortandskillandyoulosedata-collectiontime.Theideal
situation is to have two diffractometers, one equipped with each radia-
tion, and a supply of suitable crystals so that both may be fully utilized.
Some diffractometer manufacturers offer hybrid Cu/Mo instruments
with two different X-ray tubes and their associated optics but only one
area detector: switching radiation takes little time and is automated, and
there is substantial cost saving because the most expensive component
of the diffractometer (the detector) is not duplicated.
The following illustrative examples may be helpful:
a well-diffracting organic compound containing iodine:
use Mo to minimize absorption
a poorly diffracting organic compound (CHNO):
use Cu to maximize diffracted intensity
an organic compound (CHNO) with b > 50 Å:
use Cu to minimize overlap
absolute conﬁguration on C19H29N3O7
feasible only with Cu
most metal complexes, etc.

Practical aspects of data collection
a weakly diffracting platinum complex
a ‘no-win’ situation?
Where a sample diffracts too weakly on a laboratory source to yield
enough observable data, and it is considered important enough, it could
be taken to a synchrotron radiation facility. In this event several advan-
tages can accrue: the wavelength can be tuned speciﬁcally to the needs
of the sample; the intensity typically represents at least a 100-fold gain
over that of a laboratory source; the resolution between reﬂections is also
generally greater. The disadvantage is that there is heavy competition
for such a rare resource and there is often a long wait for synchrotron
beam time. For this reason, it is worth considering whether more mod-
est enhancement would overcome the problem of weak diffraction: a
longer wavelength, a lower temperature or a more powerful laboratory
source may sufﬁce.
Lastly, when considering the most appropriate wavelength for a
particular experiment, you should also bear in mind the physical restric-
tions that will preclude data collection in some areas of reciprocal space:
these limitations include where the beam stop is positioned and where
accessories such as low-temperature devices, cryostats or high-pressure
cells are deployed. The restrictions are generally much more serious at
longer wavelengths, since higher 2θ values are required to achieve the
same resolution.
6.3.2
Temperature
If a reliable low-temperature system is available it is almost always
worthwhile considering data collection at low temperature (most low-
temperature devices will even produce slightly elevated temperatures
if this is required for a special experiment, while some have extended
upper temperature limits). The beneﬁts of low-temperature data collec-
tion can only be realized if the equipment is well aligned and correctly
set up: for example, icing can lead to the crystal moving or even being
lost. Reducing the temperature of the crystal can have many advan-
tages and is essential for crystals mounted using protective oil ﬁlms,
compounds melting below about 50 ◦C and those that are thermola-
bile. Reactive compounds may be stabilized long enough to allow data
collection. There are general advantages: at lower temperatures atomic
displacements are reduced and the intensities of reﬂections at higher
Bragg angles thereby enhanced, allowing the collection of better diffrac-
tion data at higher resolution. This reduction also minimizes librational
effects that can otherwise give artiﬁcially shortened bond lengths and
other systematic errors. One advantage of the reduction in temperature
is the relative ease with which disorder can be modelled: for example,
popular pseudo-spherical anions such as BF−
4 , PF−
6 , ClO−
4 and SO2−
4 are
often badly disordered at room temperature but are either ordered or
their disorder is much easier to model at low temperature. The actual
temperature chosen is usually a compromise between the desire for the
lowest temperature and the increased risk of icing as the temperature

is reduced. For routine work on molecular crystals, temperatures in the
range 100–200 K are typical. Phase changes appear to be a relatively rare
problem but cooling can have adverse effects on poor-quality crystals,
showing up in the splitting of reﬂections, in poor orientation matrices
and larger uncertainties on cell parameters. Sometimes the splitting can
be annealed out by increasing the temperature, for example from 150 K
to200K.Evenintheseapparentlyunfavourablecasesalow-temperature
determination is often better than one at ambient temperature. The fact
that cooling methods typically involve rapid freezing of crystals on the
diffractometer opens up the question of what proportion of such crystals
are determined as metastable rather than as equilibrium phases.
6.3.3
Pressure
Although it is not used in routine experiments, the application of high
pressures provides a means of inducing structural change, including the
generation of new polymorphs that are inaccessible by any other means.
Atypical experiment involves applying pressure to material held within
a high-pressure cell, then studying the product in situ. Such experiments
are challenging, not least because the components of the high-pressure
cell severely limit how much of the sample’s diffraction pattern can be
recorded: these components also contribute strongly to the observed
diffraction pattern. Notable recent advances have included the appli-
cation to chemical crystallography of techniques originally developed
for mineralogy and physical crystallography (see for example Dawson
et al., 2004; Allan et al., 2006). This has recently been recognized by an
issue of Chemical Society Reviews (McMillan, 2006).
6.3.4
Other conditions
Considerations of crystal size, methods of mounting, choice of goniome-
ter head and optical centring have been mentioned previously but are
worth stressing again as they can seriously affect the outcome of the
experiment. The collimator selected should allow the entire crystal to
be immersed in the X-ray beam but its diameter should not be exces-
sive, as this will contribute to scattering by the air, resulting in increased
background levels. This scattering is more serious with copper than
with molybdenum radiation. The effects of an oversized crystal are also
strongly dependent on the elements in the sample: it has been shown
that with only light elements (e.g., Z ≤8) present, the use of large
(∼2 mm) crystals does not cause serious problems and may be beneﬁ-
cial because of the enhanced intensities that can be measured, or because
the data-collection time can be reduced (Görbitz, 1999).
6.4
Types of area detector
6.4.1
Multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC)
In proportional counters each incident X-ray photon causes an ioniza-
tion in the detector gas, and hence a current in a high-potential wire.

78
Practical aspects of data collection
MWPCs usually have one set of parallel wires and a second set at right
angles, and a current is induced in one or more wires of each set for
each X-ray photon. Thus, both the time and position at which the photon
arrives are known. The MWPC has the advantages over other area detec-
tors that the output signal is instantaneous (time resolution is ideal),
there is no inherent noise in the detector, and the counting efﬁciency is
high. There is, however, a problem with parallax, particularly at shorter
wavelengths, reducing the spatial precision, and the overall count rate
is limited by the dead time, which affects the detector as a whole for
every single recorded photon. MWPCs have not been used signiﬁcantly
for chemical crystallography.
6.4.2
Phosphor coupled to a TV camera
The phosphor ﬁrst converts incident X-rays to visible light. Fibre optics
provide the coupling that takes this light from the phosphor to the
low-light-level TV camera where it is detected. This type of detector
also gives an instantaneous readout, but the active area is relatively
small, as is the dynamic range, and the signal-to-noise ratio is poorer
than for other area detectors. The TV system most widely used was the
Enraf-Nonius FAST; its principal application for chemical crystallogra-
phy was in the EPSRC National Crystallography Service at Cardiff up to
1998. It is no longer commercially available, and is therefore of historical
interest only.
6.4.3
Image plate (IP)
Instead of converting X-rays to visible light, the phosphor in these
devices stores the image in the form of trapped electron colour cen-
tres. These are later ‘read’ by stimulation from visible laser light (which
causes them to emit their own characteristic light for detection by a
photomultiplier) and then erased by strong visible light before another
exposure to X-rays. The main advantages of image plates are that they
are available in large sizes and are relatively inexpensive; they also have
a high recording efﬁciency and a high spatial resolution (Fig. 6.1). The
one major disadvantage is the need for a separate read-out process,
which requires minutes rather than seconds. Faster image-plate systems
offeronesolutionbutanothermethodofincreasingthetimeavailablefor
X-ray exposure is the use of two or more plates, so that one is recording
an image while another is being read: however, this adds considerably
to the cost and complexity.
6.4.4
Charge-coupled device (CCD)
This type of detector, more familiar in video cameras and other mass-
market applications, is a semiconductor in which incident radiation
produces electron-hole pairs; the electrons are trapped in potential wells
and then read out as currents. For various reasons, direct recording of

X-rays is not usually carried out: instead, a phosphor is coupled through
ﬁbre optics to the CCD chip, which is cooled to reduce the inherent elec-
tronic noise level due to thermal excitation of electrons. Efﬁcient record-
ing, a high dynamic range and a low noise level, and a read-out time
measured in seconds or fractions of a second, combine to give the CCD
some clear advantages as a rapid area detector, but the size is limited
by the size and quality of chips available. Of the area-detector technolo-
gies now in use, this has the best potential for further development,
and considerable effort is being made in producing larger and more
sensitive chips without signiﬁcantly increasing the read-out time. Com-
mercial CCD systems for chemical crystallography are now available
from several major ﬁrms (Fig. 6.2). The next few years are likely to see

80
Practical aspects of data collection
the wider use of so-called ‘pixel arrays’, another form of solid-state
detector that should be able to record X-rays directly (i.e. without con-
version to visible light) and over a larger area. These detectors are under
active development (see for example http://pilatus.web.psi.ch/pilatus.htm)
and have a number of highly attractive features including no read-
out noise, excellent S/N ratio, no dark current (so no need to cool the
detector), read-out times of a few milliseconds per frame, very high
(20 bit) dynamic range, high quantum efﬁciency, energy discrimina-
tion and ﬂuorescence suppression. The X-ray shutter is open during
the collection, with ﬁne time slicing being done by the detector elec-
tronics, enabling rapid data collections (e.g., 4 s) and time-resolved
studies.
Area detectors do not just offer the possibility of collecting diffraction
data more quickly, although that is generally perceived as their main
advantage. They also make feasible experiments that are beyond the
scope of the old serial diffractometers, through higher sensitivity and
the recording of the whole pattern. Much of the following applies to any
type of area detector, but it will refer speciﬁcally to CCD systems, since
these are the most widely used in chemical crystallography.
6.5
Some characteristics of CCD
area-detector systems
An area detector, whether based on a CCD or an alternative technol-
ogy, is only one component of a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer. It
needs to be combined with a goniometer for mounting and moving the
crystal sample, a source of X-rays, and electronic and computing control
systems.
Although an area detector records a number of diffracted beams
simultaneously, it is still necessary to rotate the crystal in the X-ray beam
in order to access all the available reﬂections. In most chemical crystal-
lography systems, the detector is offset to one side rather than being
held perpendicular to the incident X-ray beam, so that a higher maxi-
mum Bragg angle can be observed for a single detector position. Typical
designs and conﬁgurations give data to a maximum Bragg angle θ of
around 25−30◦, appropriate for a ‘routine’ structure determination with
a more than adequate data/parameter ratio if Mo-Kα radiation is used.
The two-dimensional nature of the detector means that it is not neces-
sary to bring all reﬂections into a horizontal plane (assuming the ω-axis
is considered vertical and the incident X-ray beam horizontal), so less
movement of the crystal is required in order to access all reﬂections. The
relative advantages and disadvantages of different goniometer designs,
with one, two or three available rotations for the crystal, can be debated.
However, with only one rotation axis, for some low-symmetry crystal
systems not all reﬂections may be measurable with the particular crys-
tal orientation chosen. There is also no general agreement about the

6.5
Some characteristics of CCD area-detector systems
81
choice of rotation axis. Not having a full χ-circle does give consider-
ably more freedom for attachments such as low-temperature devices or
high-pressure cells.
Corrections for a number of factors need to be applied to raw CCD
images. These are usually fully integrated into commercial systems.
Some of the corrections are listed here.
6.5.1
Spatial distortion
The demagniﬁcation of the diffraction image from the phosphor to
the CCD chip via the ﬁbre-optic taper used in many systems is never
perfectly linear and to scale. The mapping of CCD pixels to original
face-plate positions needs to be calibrated and a correction then applied
to every image. The calibration can be made, for example, by recording
a pattern of X-rays from an amorphous scatterer or a ﬂuorescent sample
through an accurately machined grid of ﬁne holes placed over the detec-
tor face. It is valid until the phosphor-taper-CCD assembly is changed
in some way.
6.5.2
Non-uniform intensity response
Equal incident X-ray intensity at different points on the detector face
may lead to unequal numbers of electrons at the corresponding pixels
on the CCD, for various reasons involving the different components of
the system. Calibration involves recording a uniform intensity ‘ﬂood
ﬁeld’ and measuring the CCD image for this.
6.5.3
Bad pixels
Minor faults in CCD production can include individual pixels or even
rows of pixels that do not respond correctly to incident light. Substantial
faults mean an unusable chip, but a few bad pixels can be tolerated and
ﬂagged as bad, particularly in systems in which pixels are ‘binned’ by
combining 2 × 2 or other groups of pixels rather than using all pixels
individually.
6.5.4
Dark current
Thermal excitation leads to the generation and trapping of electrons in
the CCD pixel wells even when there is no incident light, and this slowly
builds up a background ‘dark image’ on the detector, which will be read
out superimposed on the true image. The effect is minimized by cooling
the CCD (typically to a temperature between −45 and −80 ◦C) and can
be corrected by recording a dark-current image (i.e. without any X-rays)
for the same time as a normal exposure and subtracting this from each
measured frame. The dark-current image is temperature dependent and
needs to be measured for the appropriate length of time, preferably aver-
aged over multiple recordings to reduce statistical ﬂuctuations. Even

82
Practical aspects of data collection
with such a correction, the noise created by thermal excitation imposes
a practical upper limit on the exposure time for each frame.
The steps involved in setting up and collecting data with an area
detector are broadly similar irrespective of the technology used.
6.6
Crystal screening
Although area-detector data are quite tolerant of poorly centred crystals,
it is obviously best to centre crystals as accurately as possible. Initial
exposures can be recorded in a matter of a few seconds to give an almost
instantaneous indication of the quality and intensity of diffraction by the
crystal. It is a good idea to record frames at one or two different φ angles
as this can detect crystals that look promising in one direction but show
serious problems in another. Such exposures are taken with the crystal
in a random orientation, and either stationary or oscillated through a
small angle (Figs. 6.3 and 6.4).
At this stage, some obvious problems such as poor (or no) crystallinity,
splitting of reﬂections and overall weak diffraction can be identiﬁed (see
Figs. 6.5 to 6.9): an obviously unsuitable crystal can be quickly discarded
and a hopefully better crystal selected. Note that such exposures are
essentially two-dimensional and may not indicate all possible reﬂection
splitting or other problems: these may only be detected when a series
of frames have been collected for unit cell determination (and indexing
may have failed – see below). The rapid screening allows more crystals
to be investigated from each sample, increasing the chance of ﬁnding
a useable one, or conversely increasing your level of certainty that no
acceptable crystals exist in that sample. However, it should be noted that
because of their greater sensitivity and efﬁciency overall, CCD systems

can often handle samples of apparently rather poor quality and still give
an acceptable structural result, so it may be worth persevering with less
promising samples: experience will tell you when to give up on your
own crystals.
A common problem occurs when you are faced with a crystal that
is of poorer quality than you would like: do you remove it from the
cold stream of the diffractometer so that you can try another crystal,
potentially losing the best available crystal, or carry on with it? This
can be important if either time or the supply or crystals is limited. One

solution is to store each crystal over liquid nitrogen after removal from
the diffractometer until it is clear which one is best. However, if you
have, even temporarily, access to two instruments you can try a less risky
procedure whereby only the poorer of each sequential pair of crystals
is removed from the diffractometer: after a few cycles of comparison it
should be possible to identify the best crystal.

the reﬂections, including interpolation between successive frames to
obtain precise setting angles, these are stored in a list by the control
program. This yields co-ordinates of observed reﬂections in reciprocal
space, referred to goniometer axes. With reasonably sized structures and
moderate intensities, there may be upwards of a hundred reﬂections. It
may be necessary in some cases to adjust the criteria for the inclusion
of reﬂections in this list: this is most commonly done on the basis of I
or I/σ for more weakly diffracting crystals, where default settings may
not yield enough reﬂections. An incorrect (or uncertain) initial matrix
and cell at this stage are not a problem, as they can be revised following
the full data collection without loss of data. One advantage in obtaining
a good initial matrix and unit cell is that it is possible to check whether
the latter corresponds to a known phase: another is that it gives some
encouragement that you will ultimately be able to index and process the
full dataset.
Fig. 6.9 A powder pattern from a poly-
crystalline sample originally thought to
be a single crystal. The variation in the
intensities of the individual lines indicates
preferred orientation within the sample.
The theory behind indexing has already been covered. Indexing of the
reﬂections and determination of the crystal orientation matrix and unit
cell parameters have the advantage of usually having many reﬂections
available and hence a lower probability of obtaining an incorrect cell.
The number of reﬂections can also make it easier to obtain a result from
twins and other samples that are not single crystals, though the outcome
then needs to be examined particularly carefully to see which reﬂections
do not ﬁt the proposed cell and whether there is a clear explanation for
this. Assessment of the mosaic spread is usually also part of this step,

and is important for decisions on how to collect the full dataset and how
to extract intensities from the raw data.

you know the cell beforehand. I would suggest starting off with upper
and lower limits on cell axes of 3 Å and 60 Å, respectively, and indices
of 15 or 20. Parameter (iii) allows less well centred reﬂections to be
included: a value of 0.1 may be too low in many cases, but more than
about 0.3–0.4 is likely to generate multiple false cells. Parameter (iv)
is useful if a minor twin component is suspected and you are trying
to index the major component, but there are more sophisticated and
controllable methods for handling such cases. If indexing fails the ﬁrst
thing to try is increasing the tolerance on parameter (iii); a visual survey
of the frames may indicate whether increasing (i) or (ii) is likely to help.
6.6.3
Re-harvest the reﬂections
If manipulation of the default list of reﬂections fails to provide a plausi-
bleindexing,itmaybeworthwhileharvestingreﬂectionsfromthestored
frames using your own criteria: these could include modiﬁed limits on
I or I/σ, resolution or other factors. Indexing on this list may prove
more successful. If indexing still fails, have a closer look at the frames,
as examination of the rocking curves may show splitting or other effects
not obvious on individual frames, which may mean that an initially
promising crystal is in fact unsuitable. It is probably time to try another
crystal if one is available. Even if indexing does work, you should always
examine the rocking curves: indexing routines are robust and can often
cope with split or broad reﬂection proﬁles, so a successful indexing
does not automatically qualify a crystal for data collection. At the same
time, you can check whether there is a good correspondence between
the diffraction pattern and the reﬂection positions predicted from your
orientation matrix: if the correspondence is poor the indexing must be
regarded as questionable. Too many predicted spots may indicate that
the cell is too large or that centring has been missed; too few could mean
the cell is too small. Carrying out these comparisons throughout all the
collected frames ensures that you can detect any crystal movement or
instrumental problem that might have occurred during data collection.
Such an occurrence is not usually a disaster: the data can be processed
in batches using different orientation matrices, but failure to detect the

6.6
Crystal screening
87
problem will give puzzling effects ranging from high merging residuals
to a failure of the structure to solve or reﬁne.
6.6.4
Still having problems?
If you are faced with a persistent failure to index, and the reasons for
this are not obvious, you may be able to call on a program that can
display a reciprocal lattice plot of all the reﬂections harvested from the
frames. By rotating the lattice you should be able to decide whether the
crystal is single or not. At any signiﬁcant sign of non-single character
the crystal should be discarded and another one examined; if all the
available crystals show twinning the procedures outlined later can be
adopted.
Even if indexing seems to have succeeded you should be wary of
unexpectedly large, often triclinic, cells with large uncertainties on their
cell dimensions. If a cell is allowed to be large and uncertain enough it
will be able to accommodate almost any list of reﬂections. If indexing
appears to succeed but some reﬂections have indices at or near special
values such as 0.50 or 0.33, this may indicate the cell is too small in that
direction and should be increased by a factor of two or three, respec-
tively. If such a situation is unclear, it does not need to be resolved now,
but can be investigated when the full area detector dataset is available.
If indexing has not worked, but there is no obvious reason for this, it
may help to acquire some additional frames, preferably from a region
of reciprocal space that has not yet been sampled. Because a valid ori-
entation matrix is not mandatory for acquiring area-detector data, these
additional frames can consist of a full data collection, in the hope that
indexing will be successful when a selection of all available reﬂections
can be used, but runs the risk that the indexing will still fail, giving a set
of frames that cannot be processed.
6.6.5
After indexing
Successful indexing is followed by least-squares reﬁnement of the ori-
entation matrix and a Bravais lattice determination. The reﬁnement also
acts as a check on whether the indexing is valid: a plausible indexing
that fails to give a satisfactory reﬁnement must be discarded. In order
to be accepted a reﬁnement must end with the vast majority of signif-
icant reﬂections having (near)-integral indices, reasonable s.u.s on cell
parameters and suitable values for various quality indicators. It may
not always be possible to be certain about the Bravais lattice.
6.6.6
Check for known cells
There is probably little point in continuing if the cell from the index-
ing is known, either in the literature or within your own group or
department.An excellent facility (CrystalWeb) for searching the relevant
crystallographic databases is available to UK academic researchers via

88
Practical aspects of data collection
the EPSRC Chemical Database Service at STFC Daresbury Laboratory
(Fletcher et al., 1996; e-mail uig@dl.ac.uk; http://cds.dl.ac.uk/cweb/).
In October 2006, EPSRC summarily announced that parts of this Service
would close at the end of March 2007, although access to CSD and ICSD
has now been secured until at least 2011.
To avoid repeating an in-house determination you should be able to
search a database of your unpublished unit cells, for example by using
a program such as LCELLS (Dolomanov et al., 2003). Finding that your
unit cell is already known is not exactly good news, but at this stage
you have invested only a few minutes in the crystal. If it is undetected
until after data collection and structure solution such duplication could
waste several hours of valuable instrument time.
6.6.7
Unit cell volume
You can calculate whether your cell volume is compatible with the
expected molecular formula, using 18 Å3 per non-hydrogen atom.
This value is valid for a wide range of organic, metal-organic and co-
ordination compounds, although some adjustment might be required
for special cases (from 14 Å3 for some highly condensed aromatic com-
pounds to 23 Å3 for some organosilicon compounds). It does not work
for inorganic compounds like NaCl or FeTiO3. A signiﬁcant discrep-
ancy may indicate that the unit cell is incorrect, that the compound is
not as proposed, or that solvent molecules are present. The number
of molecules present in the unit cell may warn you that, if the pro-
posed molecular formula is correct, symmetry considerations mean that
disorder must be present.
6.7
Data collection
It is necessary to set a small number of parameters to control the full
data collection: their values are obtained from the preliminary screening
measurements and unit cell determination. The most important factors
affecting decisions concerning these parameters are the overall intensity
level on the frames, the mosaic spread and the crystal symmetry.
6.7.1
Intensity level
The intensity level will help determine the frame measuring time,
which should be long enough to give diffraction to adequate resolu-
tion: as a very crude rule of thumb, diffraction maxima should be clearly
detectable to at least 1/2 – 2/3 of the required 2θmax. For strongly diffracting
crystals, too long an exposure time may result in detector overloads: if
this happens the time should be reduced provided this does not result
in the loss of higher-angle data. For special problems it may be feasible
to collect low-angle data relatively rapidly, while using longer exposure
times for the higher-angle data and allowing signiﬁcant overlap of the

6.7
Data collection
89
two regions. However, this requires two settings of the detector and data
collection will therefore take much longer.
6.7.2
Mosaic spread
The mosaic spread is established from the widths (x, y) of the reﬂections
on individual frames, plus an estimate of z from the width of the rocking
curves. While there is little point in taking small steps through broad
reﬂections, this may be highly advantageous for a crystal giving narrow
reﬂections. Broad reﬂections are not necessarily problematic, provided
they can be separated from neighbouring maxima, and a greater scan
width giving fewer frames may be appropriate and deliver the dataset
more rapidly. However, it is important to check that the combination of
exposure time and scan width gives the required intensity. The actual
scan mode and width chosen will depend on the software (and acqui-
sition philosophy) being used, with narrow (e.g., 0.3◦) frames being
typical for Bruker SMART instruments, while wider 1−3◦frames are
used on Nonius KappaCCD diffractometers. In the former most or all
reﬂections will be partial, and integration is carried out as part of data
reduction; in the latter the detector integrates a good fraction of the
reﬂections on each frame. As with the other factors, it is important to
choose frame widths appropriate to the individual crystal being studied.
A related issue occurs with larger unit cells (and usually Mo Kα radia-
tion), where you may have to move the detector further away from the
crystal to avoid reﬂection overlap. Unless you have quite broad reﬂec-
tions, with Mo Kα radiation you should not have to think about this until
you have axes of over 30 Å, possibly longer if the cell is centred. If you
have to move the detector back you should make sure that hardware
and software settings are compatible, although this is a problem only if
the detector distance cannot be changed under program control. A mis-
match of these settings can lead to inexplicable indexing failures. As the
crystal-to-detector distance is increased, the maximum value of 2θ that
can be recorded is reduced, and you need to make sure that data can
still be collected to the resolution you require: this may require two dif-
ferent 2θ settings. After you have collected your dataset, it is courteous
to reinstate the normal detector settings for the next user.
6.7.3
Crystal symmetry
It is useful, but not essential, to establish crystal symmetry at this stage.
The symmetry determines the minimum fraction of the whole-sphere
diffractionpatterntobemeasuredinordertoachieveacompletedataset.
If there is any doubt as to the correct diffraction symmetry, the lower
symmetryshouldalwaysbeassumed.Althoughitispossibletocalculate
the optimum set of frame runs to achieve this completeness as efﬁciently
as possible, for routine work it is sensible to collect the whole sphere of
data for triclinic crystals and at least a hemisphere for all other crys-
tal systems. Non-routine work might include higher-symmetry crystals

90
Practical aspects of data collection
that diffract weakly or are prone to decay in the X-ray beam: in such
cases it is important to use a data-collection strategy capable of deliv-
ering a unique set of data as quickly as possible. Another consideration
is that inefﬁciency in achieving the unique set will give a dataset with
higherredundancy(analternativetermis‘multiplicityofobservations’).
Despite the negative connotations of the term in other contexts, as far
as data collection and processing are concerned redundancy is a very
good thing: equivalent and duplicate reﬂections are valuable in correct-
ing data, for example for absorption, and they can be merged to provide
a unique dataset containing more precise intensity measurements.
6.7.4
Other considerations
Setting these parameters incorrectly can cause problems but area-
detector systems are generally tolerant of such mistakes. In particular,
collecting area-detector data without a valid orientation matrix is rarely
catastrophic provided valid indexing is eventually possible. Although
other data-collection parameters such as the rotation axis (e.g., ω or
φ) can also be varied, a typical data-collection setup procedure is
fairly simple and straightforward. Area-detector systems can there-
fore be operated by less experienced workers with minimal risk of
compromising data quality or completeness.
Re-recording of some of the initial frames at the end of the main data
collection and comparison of the integrated intensities allows detec-
tion of and correction for any decay, although signiﬁcant decay is rare,
particularly at low temperature.
At some point, record the crystal colour, shape and dimensions. If a list
ofindexedcrystalfacesisrequiredforanumericalabsorptioncorrection,
these will have to be measured. If you expect even very minor icing of
your crystal during the data collection, make these measurements before
you start. Finally, you could check that the X-ray generator settings are
correct, that the ﬂow of cooling water is adequate and stable and that
any low-temperature device is operating at the desired temperature and
has sufﬁcient cryogenic ﬂuid to last through the data collection.

Data reduction and correction
Once the frameset has been acquired as described in the previous
chapter, integrated intensities must be extracted from the raw frames, a
process that is computationally intensive and impossible without access
to a sufﬁciently precise orientation matrix. While the matrix found from
the initial indexing may be adequate, and it may even be possible to ini-
tiate data reduction to run in parallel with the acquisition of the frames,
this is not always the case and the safest procedure is to harvest reﬂec-
tionsfromtheentiredataset,re-index(tochecktheunitcell)andre-reﬁne
the matrix using this longer list. Integration software uses the orienta-
tion matrix to determine the reﬂection positions, and the estimation of
intensities can exploit the three-dimensional information available for
each reﬂection through some form of proﬁle ﬁtting. There may also be
facilities for updating and reﬁning the orientation matrix during the
integration process, to allow for uncertainties or gradual changes in the
crystal orientation, but if a high-quality matrix can be determined that
is valid for all frames it is best to use that.
An integration program will also require the relevant calibration and
correction ﬁles in order to apply any corrections (see previous chapter)
that were not applied to the frames as they were being collected.
A typical integration method is that developed by Kabsch (1988).
Reﬂection spot shapes are determined for different regions on the face
of the detector. These model shapes are then used for determining the
area of integration for each reﬂection. The model proﬁle shapes are also
used to calculate correlation coefﬁcients that can be used to reject data
and to ﬁt proﬁles to weak reﬂections.

be reﬁned or ﬁxed. In both cases trial integration runs can be used to

obtain reasonable initial values. It may be better to err on the wide side
but if the width is too great the integration boxes of neighbouring reﬂec-
tions will overlap and produce incorrect intensities. Once the integration
program is running, it should produce some form of diagnostic output:
examination of this (usually with the aid of a manual or other docu-
mentation) provides an indication of how the integration is proceeding.
However, the volume of the raw output can be daunting, and if effec-
tive visualization tools are not available many users will only refer to the
output if they subsequently encounter problems. Users are more likely
to notice and act on the information if it is presented in an accessible
graphical form.
A suitably constrained unit cell reﬁnement (Fig. 7.1) should be car-
ried out, either as part of the data reduction or separately, and should
include a high proportion of the signiﬁcant reﬂections (some software
uses all reﬂections). Although the absolute number of reﬂections is
always high, there may be examples where unit cells reﬁned against
a small proportion of the total data should be regarded with caution.
7.3
Corrections
A description of the required corrections to integrated data appears
in Chapter 5 and these are applied during the integration procedure.1
1Other possible corrections: (a) Extinc-
tion predominantly affects strong, low-
angle reﬂections and is normally corrected
for approximately by reﬁning a single
correction factor during structure reﬁne-
ment. Secondary extinction is wavelength
dependent, being worse with copper than
with molybdenum radiation. (b) Thermal
diffuse scattering (TDS) can artiﬁcially
enhance the intensity of some high-angle
reﬂections. The fact that TDS decreases
with temperature provides yet another
incentive to collect low-temperature data.
(c) Multiple-diffraction effects are more
likely to occur if a prominent lattice vec-
tor is aligned with the rotation axis. They
are most obvious where they cause signif-
icant intensity to appear at the position of
a systematic absence. If their signiﬁcance
is not noted they can cause problems with
space group determination, especially if
they affect screw-axis absences. They can
also be recognized by their anomalously
narrow reﬂection proﬁles. (d) Some data-
reduction programs will attempt to com-
pensate for the effects of crystals that are
larger than the X-ray beam. This does not
appear to be problematic for crystals con-
taining light elements, but in other cases
you should avoid this situation rather than
trying to correct for it.
Lorentz and polarization factors (which are instrument speciﬁc) must
be accounted for in all diffractometer measurements. There are vari-
ous methods available for absorption corrections. Numerical corrections
can be made on the basis of indexed faces, but routines that exploit
the redundancy present in the data are more widely used (Blessing,
1995; Sheldrick, 1996–2008). Note that redundancy is often rather low

7.5

95
for triclinic crystals, and in such cases the corrections need to be assessed
particularly carefully. Alternatively, empirical corrections are always
available if all else fails. The range of correction factors output may differ
signiﬁcantly from the range predicted from the cell contents and crystal
dimensions, due in part to the fact that the corrections can encompass
systematic effects other than absorption.
7.4
Output
Part of the output from the data-reduction routine usually includes
analyses of data-signiﬁcance (I/σ ratios as a function of Bragg angle
and other variables), data coverage, and redundancy and consistency
amongequivalentdataunderanyassumeddiffractionsymmetry.Exam-
ination of any such output is strongly recommended: it might cause
you to question your assumptions about the diffraction symmetry, the
validity of the orientation matrix, the quality of the crystal or the com-
pleteness or resolution of your data. You may decide that you need to
re-process the frames. In the most serious cases, and if the crystal is for-
tunately still on the diffractometer, you may even decide that you would
feel safer collecting some more data. However, in most cases there will
be no signiﬁcant problems, and the dataset is available for structure
solution.
7.5
A typical experiment?
The level of detail given in the previous sections may have obscured
a key feature of CCD-based diffractometers, namely their simplicity of
use: below is an outline of an experiment where no particular prob-
lems are encountered. The times shown in brackets for each part of the
procedure are very approximate.
1. Mount, orient and optically centre the crystal (1 minute).
2. Assess crystal quality using still or limited-oscillation exposures
(1 minute).
3. Collect some frames and harvest reﬂections for indexing (several
minutes).
4. Index, reﬁne orientation matrix and determine Bravais lattice
(1 minute).
5. Check whether the unit cell is known and whether its volume is
sensible (1 minute).
6. Survey frames visually to check indexing and assess quality (a few
minutes).
7. Determine the exposure time, frame width and fraction to collect
(1 minute).
8. Record the crystal colour, shape and dimensions (1 minute); index
faces if required (a few minutes).
9. Collect the data (several minutes to hours).

96
Practical aspects of data processing
10. Re-determine the matrix using all available/signiﬁcant reﬂections
(a few minutes).
11. Survey frames visually as a check on the orientation matrix (a few
minutes).
12. Process the data, applying corrections as required (several minutes).
Items 2–6 represent decision points where you have to decide whether
it is worth continuing with the current crystal, and if so how the data
should be collected. If indexing fails at point 4, you might decide to
continue in the hope of succeeding at point 10.
Once a frameset has been processed to yield a ﬁle of reﬂections, you
can analyze these in order to establish the likely space group(s), by
looking at systematic absences and statistical intensity distributions (see
Chapter 4).
7.6
Examples of more problematic cases
As noted above, it is possible to collect a frameset on very unpromising
crystals: with area-detector data the challenge is to process the frames
to give a useable dataset. The difﬁculties most commonly arise from the
inherent quality of the crystal, but others may arise from the techniques
used or from instrumental factors. Any circumstances that cause difﬁ-
culties in deﬁning either a single accurate, valid orientation matrix or
an appropriate description of peak shapes throughout the frameset, are
likely to require some special intervention.
Example 1. A frameset would not index as a whole, despite the
appearance of the frames suggesting no problems.
Solution 1. It proved possible to index each run of frames individu-
ally, giving the same unit cell but slightly different orientation matrices.
No decay was detected and the problem was traced to mechanical slip-
page of the φ circle while it was driving between runs. The data could
be processed successfully by using a separate orientation matrix for
each run.
Example 2. The symptoms were similar to Example 1, but only an
approximate matrix could be deﬁned for each run of frames. Exami-
nation of the frames suggested a systematic drift in the positions of the
reﬂections during each run, relative to their predicted positions. These
symptoms were taken as evidence of a crystal that was not securely
mounted, either because of a poor bond between the crystal and ﬁbre
(or ﬁbre and support), or because of changes occurring in the crystal.
Solution 2. In this case, a failure of the low-temperature system could
be ruled out, and examination of the frames suggested the crystal was
unchanged, pointing to an insecurely mounted crystal. The data were
processed using a separate matrix for each run, but with each matrix
being updated through the run to accommodate the movement of the

7.6
Examples of more problematic cases
97
crystal. If processing had been unsuccessful, it would probably have
been necessary to remount the crystal more securely and recollect all
the frames.
Example 3. A crystal was coated in microcrystalline material that
proved impossible to remove without damaging the crystal, and this
contributed a pervasive background of weak reﬂections in the diffrac-
tion pattern.
Solution 3. It was possible to isolate and integrate the reﬂections from
the main crystal by ﬁrst deriving a matrix based strictly on the strongest
reﬂections, and then extending this to include those of medium intensity.
Only a small number of intensities in the ﬁnal dataset were signiﬁcantly
affected by overlap from reﬂections from the small crystallites.
Example 4. Acrystal indexed with a primitive unit cell with a moderat-
ely long b-axis of 32 Å, but with broad reﬂections (FWHM=1.2◦).
Solution 4. The combination of long axis and rather broad reﬂections
could lead to reﬂection overlap, so the crystal-to-detector distance was
increased prior to data collection. This allowed larger integration box
sizes to be assessed without causing overlap.
Example 5. Examination of reﬂection proﬁles showed that their widths
varied strongly as a function of goniometer angle. This pronounced
anisomosaicity made it difﬁcult to establish a single integration box size.
Solution 5. It may be possible simply to allow the box size to vary
continuously during the integration, so that it always corresponds to the
characteristics of the local reﬂections. If this option is not available in the
software, or if it does not work satisfactorily, another approach is to use
ﬁxed integration box parameters that are somewhat biased towards the
wider reﬂection proﬁles, followed by correction of the resulting dataset
using multiscan methods (e.g., Blessing, 1995; Sheldrick, 1996–2008).
Example 6. Initial frames indicated serious problems with crystal
quality, including split and poorly shaped reﬂections, as well as the
possibility of more than one component, but it was possible to index the
main component of the pattern.
Solution 6. The sample should be surveyed for better crystals but
if these are not forthcoming it is probably worthwhile collecting the
frames in the hope that the intensities from the main component can
be extracted, giving a starting point for space group determination and
structure solution. Twinning may be present in these circumstances (see
below).
Example 7. Initial indexing yielded a primitive unit cell with one very
long axis (85.6 Å), giving a strong likelihood of severe overlap at the
standard crystal-to-detector distance.

98
Practical aspects of data processing
Solution 7. The overlap problem here can be avoided by increasing the
standard crystal-to-detector distance signiﬁcantly, but this may mean
that the highest achievable 2θ value is rather low. To achieve adequate
resolution, frames will have to be collected at two different detector
theta settings, chosen so that the 2θ ranges overlap. The high-angle data
could be collected using a much longer exposure for each frame. A sim-
ilar strategy of different detector settings and exposure times might
be adopted where diffraction is strong at low angle but then falls off
strongly towards higher angles.
Example 8. The output from the integration program showed good
completeness, a mean redundancy of almost 4.0 and a high propor-
tion of data with I > 2σ(I). There were no indications of problems with
crystal quality, the orientation matrix or the modelling of the reﬂection
proﬁles. However, the internal agreement was terrible, with a merging
R value of 0.66 under monoclinic symmetry. Unsurprisingly, structure
solution failed.
Solution 8. Based on metric considerations alone, the Bravais-lattice
determination had clearly indicated monoclinic C. In the light of the
poor agreement between the intensties under monoclinic symmetry,

Twinning and area-detector data
A much more extensive treatment of twinning appears in Chapter 18,
but some comments regarding non-merohedral twinning are appropri-
ate here. As mentioned above, it is not necessary to have an orientation
matrix before initiating data collection on an area-detector diffractome-

problems are encountered with structure solution or reﬁnement; how-
ever, the procedures required to address the problem are identical. It is
obviously helpful to recognize twinning as early as possible: otherwise
you might waste a lot of time, for example by pursuing other solutions to
an unsatisfactory reﬁnement. At the reﬁnement stage, previously unde-
tected non-merohedral twinning may generate a number of symptoms,
including:
• stubbornly high R indices, with no obvious cause such as disorder,
• high-difference Fourier residuals, again with no obvious cause,

• individual reﬂections with F(obs)2 ≫F(calc)2, with certain indices

• the lowest relative F(calc)2 ranges show extreme values for certain
indicators.

of being a non-merohedral twin.
The ﬁrst indications of non-merohedral twinning may be visible in
the diffraction pattern (Fig. 7.2): deviations from a regular lattice of
well-shaped diffraction maxima may indicate non-merohedral twin-
ning, although they could also indicate other problems. These features
might include adjacent but incompatible (i.e. mutually inclined) recip-
rocal lattice rows; a minority of reﬂections that do not correspond to
the orientation matrix that ﬁts the majority; and reﬂections that show
splitting, overlap, irregular spacing or strange peak shapes.
Although each case has to be assessed individually, the following is a
general procedure for dealing with twinned area-detector data:
• examine frameset for visible indications of twinning,
• use pseudo-precession photographs or other visualization aids,
• identify major twin component, perhaps visually, or using spe-
cial software such as DirAx (Duisenberg, 1992), GEMINI (Bruker,
2004), TwinSolve (Rigaku, 1999–2009), etc.,
• index the major twin component and save reﬁned orientation
matrix 1,
• identify minor twin component,
• index the minor twin component and save reﬁned orientation
matrix 2,
• repeat the last two steps for any further minor components,
• determine and view the relationships between the different
matrices,
• generate predicted patterns using matrices and check these against
frames,
• export orientation matrices for use by your data-reduction
program,
• process the frameset using the orientation matrices,
• output separate or combined datasets for solution and reﬁnement.
7.8
Some other special cases (in brief)
Incommensurate structures. A single unit cell and orientation matrix
are not adequate in such cases because different parts of the structure
exhibit different repeats. The stored frames can be processed to extract
all the required data.
Collection of powder or ﬁbre data. As the whole diffraction pattern
is available, data can be extracted in different ways, for example by
integrating intensity around a powder ring.
Studying phase changes. It is much easier to follow a phase transfor-
mation when the whole diffraction pattern is recorded.

Practical aspects of data processing
Diffuse scattering. This can provide information about local structure
(including disorder) in addition to conventional crystallographic data
(e.g., Welberry, 2004).
Exploring lattice defects. Again, the ability to monitor what is happen-
ing between the Bragg positions is valuable.

Introduction
The crystal structure we are trying to determine and its X-ray diffraction
pattern are related to each other by the mathematical process of Fourier
transformation; each is the Fourier transform of the other, as shown in
the introductory material. It is worth beginning here with a summary
of the fundamental relationships involved and some comments on the
notation and its meaning.
X-rays are scattered by the electrons in a crystal structure, so what
we are able to determine is the electron-density distribution, averaged
over time and hence over the vibrations of the atoms. Since the crystal
structure is periodic, we need determine only the contents of one unit
cell, and the presence of symmetry other than pure translation reduces
this even further, to the asymmetric unit of the structure, which is a
fraction of the unit cell in all cases except space group P1.
The electron density is a smoothly varying continuous function with a
single numerical value (in units of electrons per cubic Ångstrom, e Å−3)
at each point in the structure. For many of the calculations involved
in crystallography this is not a convenient function to work with, and
we describe the structure instead in terms of the positions and dis-
placements (vibrations) of discrete atoms, each with its own electron
density distribution about its centre. In most studies (except for high-
resolution charge-density experiments), atoms are taken to be spherical
in shape when stationary, ignoring valence effects such as bonding and
lone pairs of electrons, and their individual contributions to X-ray scat-
tering, known as atomic scattering factors, are calculated from electron
densities derived from quantum mechanics. These atomic scattering fac-
tors are known mathematical functions, varying with Bragg angle θ,
available in published tables (such as the International Tables for Crys-
tallography), and incorporated in standard crystallography computer
programs. The X-ray scattering effects of atoms are modiﬁed by atomic
displacements, which cause the at-rest electron density to be spread
out over a larger volume and usually unequally in different directions
(anisotropic), and this effect is described by a set of anisotropic dis-
placement parameters (adps) for each atom. The most commonly used
mathematical model uses six adps and can be represented graphically
as an ellipsoid. This model is a reasonable approximation to physical
reality in most cases.
103

Fourier syntheses
Thus, each symmetry-independent atom in the asymmetric unit of
a crystal structure is described by the following parameters: a known
atomic scattering factor (f), a set of displacement parameters (U values),
and three co-ordinates (x, y, z) specifying its position. (In some cases,
such as disordered structures, another parameter is used, giving the
site occupancy factor, because a site may be occupied by an atom in
some unit cells and not in others, at random, so on average we have to
specify a fraction of an atom here.) We give atomic positions relative to
one corner of one unit cell chosen as the origin, and measured along each
of the unit cell axes. Rather than using Å as units for the co-ordinates,
we give them as fractions of the unit cell axis lengths, and these fractions
do not have units. This means, for example, that the origin of the unit
cell has co-ordinates 0,0,0 and the point right in the centre of the unit cell
has co-ordinates 1/2, 1/2, 1/2. It is convenient to take most co-ordinates to lie
in the range 0–1, but molecules do not generally lie conveniently within
the conﬁnes of an arbitrarily deﬁned unit cell, so some co-ordinates
may be negative or be greater than 1. A majority of co-ordinates outside
the range 0–1 simply means a poorly chosen unit cell origin, with the
molecule lying largely or entirely outside the ‘home’ unit cell. This is,
of course, not strictly incorrect, since all unit cells are exact copies of
each other by deﬁnition, and any integer can always be added to or
subtracted from all x, all y, or all z co-ordinates, but it is bad practice.
8.2
Forward and reverse Fourier transforms
The diffraction pattern (a set of discrete reﬂections, each a wave with
its own amplitude and relative phase) is the Fourier transform of the
crystal structure. The mathematical relationship for this is given by:
F(hkl) =
N

j=1
fj exp[2πi(hxj + kyj + lzj)].
(8.1)
Here, fj is the atomic scattering factor for the jth atom in the unit cell,
which has co-ordinates xj, yj, zj; fj incorporates the effects of atomic dis-
placements in this equation, in order to keep it simple. The integers h, k
and l are the indices for one particular reﬂection, occurring in a certain
direction, and this equation shows how the structure factor F for that
reﬂection is related to the crystal structure. What this equation means
in words is that each reﬂection in the diffraction pattern is a wave and
it is made up as a sum of waves scattered by the individual atoms, each
atom in accordance with its electron-density distribution (fj); in adding
up the waves scattered in this direction, their relative phases have to
be allowed for, and these depend on the positions of the atoms relative
to each other, as expressed in the exponential term. For mathematical
convenience and compactness, complex number notation is used (hence
the symbol i), allowing us to use just one symbol to represent both the
amplitude and phase together for a wave. F(hkl) is a complex number,

as explained in Chapter 1 and Appendix A, with an amplitude and a
phase. Equation (8.1) applies once for each reﬂection (each direction in
which a discrete diffracted beam occurs) in order to obtain the complete
diffraction pattern, and each calculation involves the sum of N terms,
this being the number of atoms in the unit cell. The presence of sym-
metry in the structure allows the calculations to be simpliﬁed further,
because symmetry-equivalent reﬂections have the same amplitude and
related phases, but we shall keep with general equations here.
Equation (8.1) can be used to calculate the expected diffraction pattern
for any known structure, and it is used at various stages during a crystal-
structure determination, even when the ‘known structure’ is incomplete.
Werefertotheresultofthisasasetof calculatedstructurefactors,Fc(hkl)
or just Fc.
Equation (8.1) also describes mathematically the physical process
observed when X-rays are diffracted by a crystal, which is the exper-
iment of collecting diffraction data. From the experiment, however, we
obtain only the amplitudes of the reﬂections (derived from the mea-
sured intensities) and not their phases. Thus, we have a set of observed
structure factors, but they are only |Fo|. We do not have any observed
phases, so the observed diffraction pattern is, in this sense, incomplete.
One particular F is never measured in the diffraction experiment, but
is important for future use. This is the structure factor F(000), corre-
sponding to completely in-phase scattering by all atoms in the forward
direction with θ = 0, and it can not be physically separated from the
undiffracted beam. Setting all indices to zero in (8.1) and noting that
atomic displacement parameters have no effect at zero Bragg angle, we
ﬁnd that F(000) has an amplitude equal to the total number of electrons
in one unit cell, and has a phase of zero.
That is half the story, which we may call the forward Fourier trans-
form. The other half is the reverse Fourier transform. The crystal
structure, expressed as electron density, is the Fourier transform of the
diffraction pattern. This relationship is expressed as:
ρ(xyz) = 1
V

hkl
F(hkl) exp[−2πi(hx + ky + lz)].
(8.2)
There is an obvious similarity to (8.1), with the terms for the diffraction
patternandforthecrystalstructureexchangedbetweentheleftandright
sides of the equation. The main differences otherwise are the inclusion
of the unit cell volume V in (8.2) (to make sure the units are correct,
since the crystal structure here is described by its electron density ρ
instead of by discrete atomic scattering factors that, like structure factor
amplitudes, have units of electrons rather than e Å−3), and the presence
of a minus sign in the exponential.
Equation (8.2) is the basis of all Fourier synthesis calculations in crys-
tallography. It shows how the electron density in the crystal structure
can, in principle, be obtained from the diffraction pattern. Like the
forward Fourier transform, it describes a physical process, but this time

one that is unachievable in an experiment. It is the equivalent of the use
of lenses in an optical microscope to take light scattered by an object
being viewed, and recombine the scattered waves to produce a focused
image of the object; unfortunately X-rays can not be bent by lenses in
the same way as visible light, or we would be able to build an X-ray
supermicroscope and not have so much work to do! The equation says
that, in order to ﬁnd the electron density at a particular point in the
structure, we have to take all the individual scattered X-ray waves (the
reﬂections F) and add them together, allowing for their different relative
phases. The phase differences will vary with the position at which we
are ﬁnding the electron density, because the waves will have different
path lengths in converging on that point, and this is the meaning of the
exponential term again; but the waves also have different phases from
their initial production in the diffraction process (given by the forward
Fourier transform), and these have to be included as well.
Since this physical process can not actually be carried out, we have
to emulate it by calculation, using (8.2). Unfortunately, this is still not
possible in a direct way, because we do not have all the information
required. In (8.2), F(hkl) are complex numbers, with an amplitude and
a phase: although we have the structure factor amplitudes, we do not
know the intrinsic relative phases of the reﬂections. Much of the task of
solving a crystal structure is recovering the lost phase information, at
least as approximate values, so that the reverse Fourier transform can
be carried out.
Modiﬁed versions of (8.2) are used at various stages in a crystal-
structure determination, as our knowledge of the phases develops from
non-existenttoessentiallycomplete,andthesearereferredtoasdifferent
kinds of Fourier syntheses or Fourier maps.
In order for (8.2) to give an accurate result for the electron density,
it is not only necessary to have phases and to have accurate values for
the reﬂection amplitudes (i.e. good data!); we should, in principle, also
include all possible reﬂections with indices between −∞and +∞. This
is clearly unachievable, and the effect is to produce some distortions in
the electron density, which may be seen as small ripples surrounding
the atoms, most noticeable around atoms with high electron density.
It is, however, not usually a signiﬁcant problem, since the form of
atomic scattering factors, together with atomic displacements, means
that diffraction intensities decrease at higher Bragg angles, and the
unmeasured high-index small amplitudes would not contribute much
to the Fourier summations anyway. Inclusion of F(000) is important
in order to obtain correct electron density values, since all other terms
effectively contribute no net electron density to the total in the unit cell,
because they are waves consisting of equal positive and negative parts.
A Fourier synthesis may be thought of as smearing out the correct total
number of electrons uniformly throughout the unit cell (this is the F(000)
term) and then redistributing this density by successive addition of
other waves, each of which will reduce the density in some regions and
increase it in others by the same amount; the ﬁnal result has the electron

density concentrated in discrete maxima corresponding to atoms, with
low or zero (but never negative) electron-density regions in between.
8.3
Some mathematical and computing
considerations
Since Fourier transform calculations, both forward and reverse, take up
a very high proportion of the amount of computing involved in crystal-
lography, they need to be carried out as efﬁciently as possible. The scale
of the task can be illustrated easily. For the forward Fourier transfor-
mation, consider a unit cell of dimensions 10×10×10 Å3 containing 60
atoms. Typically, this will give about 7000 reﬂections up to a maximum
θ of 25◦with Mo-Kα radiation. Calculation of the diffraction pattern Fc
thus involves 7000 sums (ignoring symmetry), in each of which there
are 60 terms. This makes 420 000 calculations, each of which includes
exponentials, multiplications and additions. This is a relatively small
structure!
For the reverse Fourier transformation, consider the same crystal
structure. From (8.2) we obtain values of the electron density at discrete
points in the unit cell, not a continuous function. This means calculat-
ing values at selected points on a three-dimensional grid covering the
unit cell. In order to resolve adjacent atoms and make good use of the
available data, a grid spacing of about 0.3 Å is reasonable, giving about
37 000 grid points. So, (8.2) has to be used 37 000 times, each one being
a sum of 7000 terms, making a total of about 260 million calculations.
And this is for just one Fourier synthesis.
The presence of symmetry does reduce the size of the task, of course,
because symmetry-equivalent reﬂections have the same amplitude and
related (not generally equal) phases, so the forward Fourier trans-
formation only has to be carried out for the symmetry-unique data
set. Similarly, the electron density need be calculated only for the
asymmetric unit, and not for the complete unit cell.
In addition, there are various well-known mathematical procedures
for simplifying the calculations involved, because of the properties of
sines and cosines of sums of terms, as shown in Appendix A. The
details of these do not need to concern us here; although Fourier
calculations were carried out by hand in the early pioneering days
of crystallography before the widespread availability of fast comput-
ers (and were often restricted to one- and two-dimensional synthe-
ses rather than full three-dimensional studies, to provide projections
of electron density, from which full structures were subsequently
deduced), these calculations are now performed at very high speed in
‘black boxes’.
It should be noted that the phases of reﬂections can take any value
between 0 and 360◦(0 and 2π radians) for non-centrosymmetric struc-
tures. By contrast, phases are restricted to a choice of two values,
0 and 180◦(0 and π radians) when a structure is centrosymmetric. This

108
Fourier syntheses
considerably simpliﬁes the mathematics, since the complex exponen-
tial terms collapse to real cosines, with disappearance of the imaginary
sine components. In pictorial physical terms, this means that each of the
waves being added together in (8.2) can only be completely in phase (0,
crest-to-crest) or completely out of phase (180◦, crest-to-trough), and
the problem of ﬁnding the unknown phases reduces to the smaller
(but still considerable) task of ﬁnding the unknown signs, positive or
negative, for the reﬂection amplitudes |F| in order to add the waves
together.

do not all give separate maxima. The small
peak at the centre is the outer edge of the
central carbon atom of the group, which
lies below this plane, where the electron
density is higher and reaches its maximum
for this atom.
A Fourier synthesis is a three-dimensional function, usually obtained
as a set of values on a three-dimensional grid. In chemical crystallog-
raphy, it is rare for such a result to be presented in full. Normally, the
positions of maxima (also called peaks) in the synthesis are found by
interpolation between the grid points (effectively a form of curve ﬁtting
in three dimensions) as part of the computing procedure, and these posi-
tions, together with the corresponding values of the electron density, are
listed and made available as potential atom sites for visual inspection
or, more likely, interpretation through a molecular graphics program.
In most cases, this works satisfactorily, but it causes problems when
atom sites are not clearly resolved from each other, giving no discrete
maximum in the synthesis. This is the norm in protein crystallogra-
phy, where data often do not extend to atomic resolution, and different
techniques are used. With atomic-resolution data, the most common
occurrence of this problem is in cases of disorder, when the alternative
sites may be too close together to give separate maxima. Inspection of
the full Fourier synthesis in the region of the disorder may be necessary.
This can involve taking planar sections through the three-dimensional
synthesis. Sections parallel to the unit cell faces are straightforward,
as these will correspond to the grid points on which the synthesis has
been performed, but sections in arbitrary orientations can also be calcu-
lated, either explicitly at appropriate points or by interpolation between
the points of the standard grid. The sections can be contoured with lines
joiningpointsofequalelectrondensity,likethecontoursshowingmoun-
tains on geographical maps, and this helps to show regions of electron
density that can correspond to atom sites, even if disorder is a problem.

Here, the structure factor F has been separated into its amplitude |F|
and its phase φ, both of which are needed in order to carry out the
calculation.
Different kinds of Fourier syntheses use different coefﬁcients instead
of the amplitudes |F|, and they may also in some cases apply weights
to the individual terms in the sum, so that not all reﬂections contribute
strictlyinproportiontothesecoefﬁcients.Theseareallattemptstoobtain
as much useful information as possible at different stages of the structure
determination, even if the phases are not well known.
8.4.1
Patterson syntheses
These are discussed in detail in the next chapter. The coefﬁcients are
|Fo|2 instead of |Fo|, and all phases are set equal to zero. In this case
all necessary information is known and the synthesis can be readily
performed. The result, of course, is not the electron density distribution
for the structure, but it is related to it in what is often a useful way, as
is explained later. There are some slight variations even within this use,
and these are covered in the Patterson synthesis chapter (Chapter 9).
8.4.2
E-maps
These are an important part of direct methods for solving crystal struc-
tures, and are discussed more fully in Chapter 10. The coefﬁcients are
|Eo|, the so-called normalized observed structure factor amplitudes,
which represent the diffraction pattern expected for point atoms (with
their electron density concentrated into a single point instead of spread
out over a ﬁnite volume) of equal size, at rest. E-values are calculated,
with a number of assumptions and approximations, from the observed
amplitudes |Fo|, and only the largest values are used, weaker reﬂections
being ignored because they contribute less to the Fourier synthesis any-
way. Phases for this selected subset of the full data are estimated by
a range of techniques under the general heading of ‘direct methods’,
and usually a number of different phase sets are produced and used to
calculated E-maps. These maps tend to contain sharper (stronger and
narrower) maxima than normal Fourier syntheses (F-maps), and this
can help to show up possible atoms, but they also tend to contain more
noise (peaks, usually of smaller size, that do not correspond to genuine
atoms).
8.4.3
Full electron-density maps,
using (8.2) or (8.3) as they stand
These actually tend not to be used very often in chemical crystallog-
raphy, except for demonstration purposes, because the other types of
syntheses have particular advantages at different stages. However, let
us consider how we can carry out such a synthesis without having any

110
Fourier syntheses
experimental phases. Such a procedure can be used when some of the
atoms have been located (perhaps from direct methods or a Patterson
synthesis) and others still remain to be found. Once we have some
atoms, we can use them as a model structure, which we know is not
complete, but it contains all the information we currently have. From
the model structure we can use (8.1) to calculate what its diffraction
pattern would be. This will not be identical to the observed diffraction
pattern, but it should show some resemblance to it, the more nearly so
as we include more atoms in the correct positions. There are various
measures of agreement between the sets of observed and calculated
amplitudes, |Fo| and |Fc|, but the important thing is that the calcu-
lated diffraction pattern includes phases, φc as well as amplitudes |Fc|.
Although these are not the same as the true phases we would really like
to know, they are currently the nearest thing we have to them. AFourier
synthesis using coefﬁcients |Fc| with the phases φc would just repro-
duce the same model structure and get us nowhere, but combining the
true observed amplitudes |Fo| with the ‘current-best-estimate’ phases φc
gives us a new electron-density map. If the calculated phases are not too
far from the correct phases (as is usually the case if the model structure
has atoms in approximately correct places and these are a signiﬁcant
proportion of the electron density of the structure), then this usually
shows the atoms of the model structure again, together with new fea-
tures not in the model structure but demanded by the diffraction data,
i.e. more genuine atoms. Because of all the approximations involved in
this process, there may also be peaks in the electron-density map that
do not correspond to real atoms, and the results need to be interpreted
in the light of chemical structural sense and what is expected. Addi-
tion of these new genuine atoms gives a better model structure, and
the whole process can be repeated, giving better calculated phases and
yet another new, and clearer, Fourier synthesis. This is done repeatedly
until all the atoms have been found and the model structure essentially
reproduces itself.
8.4.4
Difference syntheses
These are widely used in preference to full electron-density syntheses
for expanding partial structures. The coefﬁcients are |Fo| −|Fc| and the
phases are obtained from a model structure as described above. The
result is effectively an electron-density map from which the features
already in the model structure are removed, so that new features stand
out more clearly, and it usually makes it easier to ﬁnd new atoms. This
is rather like saying that, if the tallest peaks in a range of mountains
were somehow taken away, the foothills would appear to be much more
impressive! Peaks lying at the positions of atoms in the model structure,
or negative difference electron density there, indicate that the model
has either too little or too much electron density in those places, and can
indicateawronglyassignedatomtype,e.g.NinsteadofOorNinsteadof

C for these respective effects. An example is shown in Fig. 8.3. There are
potentially some considerable problems with difference syntheses when
the proportion of known atoms is quite small, because the calculated
phases can have large errors. Also, weak reﬂections with relatively large
uncertainties in their intensities can cause disproportionate errors, and
it may be best not to use the weakest reﬂections; alternatively they can
be given reduced weights, as discussed below. It is important to ensure
that the observed and calculated data are on the same scale. Another
reason why difference syntheses can be better than full Fo syntheses is
that series termination errors (small ripple effects due to the lack of data
beyond the measured θmax) cancel out through use of the differences
instead of full amplitudes.
8.4.5
2Fo −Fc syntheses
The use of coefﬁcients 2|Fo| −|Fc| with phases calculated from a model
structure combines the advantages of standard Fo and difference synthe-
ses. The resulting map shows both the known and the as-yet unknown
features of the structures, with the new atoms emphasized, and it is
less subject to some of the errors of the simple difference synthesis.
It is more widely used in protein crystallography than by chemical
crystallographers.

8.4.6
Other uses of difference syntheses
Towards the end of structure determination, difference maps are often
used to locate hydrogen atoms. These can not usually be found until
all other atoms are present and have been reﬁned with anisotropic
displacement parameters, so that their contributions are correctly rep-
resented in the model structure. This is because hydrogen atoms have
very little electron density, and even that is signiﬁcantly involved in
bonding, so the positions found in difference maps are usually closer to
the nearest atom than are the actual centres (the nuclei) of the hydrogen
atoms. Unless data are of good quality, and particularly when heavy
atoms are present in the structure, hydrogen atoms can easily be lost in
the noise of an electron-density map. This is particularly true for non-
centrosymmetric structures, where the absence of hydrogen atoms in a
model structure is partially compensated by shifts in the phases from
their correct values; any Fourier synthesis using calculated phases will
always have a bias towards the model structure from which they were
obtained. Hydrogen atoms contribute relatively more to low-angle and
less to high-angle reﬂections, because their atomic scattering factor falls
off more quickly with θ than those of other atoms, so it may help to
leave out the high-angle data, or use weights that reduce their contri-
bution to the sums. Right at the end of a structure determination, when
reﬁnement is complete, a ﬁnal difference synthesis must be generated
in order to see if there is any remaining electron density unexplained
by the reﬁned model. This must include all data and use no weights.
Residual electron density may be an artefact of inadequate data correc-
tions (usually absorption), or may indicate poorly modelled disorder or
other problems and imperfections in the model. The sizes of the largest
maxima and minima in this ﬁnal difference map, together with their
positions if they are of signiﬁcant size, are important indicators of the
quality of a structure determination, and should always be included in
any summary of the results.
8.5
Weights in Fourier syntheses
It was noted above that the calculated phases, derived from the current
model structure, are only an estimate of the true phases. Clearly the
approximation improves as the model structure becomes more com-
plete. In any given set of calculated phases, some will be more in error
than others. For a reﬂection with large and almost equal |Fo| and |Fc|
there is greater conﬁdence in the reliability of the phase than there is
when |Fc| is small. This variation in reliability of the phases can be
incorporated into the calculations by multiplying each contribution by
a weight, which increases with expected reliability. Various weight-
ing schemes have been developed and used, with weights calculated
from the values of the observed and calculated amplitudes and the pro-
portion of unknown electron density in the structure. Appropriately

8.6

chosen weights can help to enhance the genuine new features of
Fourier syntheses and reduce noise. Weights that are θ-dependent can
be used to aid the search for hydrogen atoms in the later stages, by
down-weighting the higher-angle data containing less information from
these atoms. No weights may be used in the ﬁnal difference synthe-
sis for checking the completeness of a reﬁned structure; by this stage
the calculated phases will be as close to the correct values as they
can be.
8.6
Illustration in one dimension
For a one-dimensional structure (this direction taken as the z-axis) with
inversion symmetry, (8.3) simpliﬁes considerably:
ρ(z) = 1
c

l
|F(l)| s(l) cos[2π(lz)]
(8.4)
and the Fourier summation can easily be demonstrated pictorially. Only
positive values of the index l need to be considered, each giving a double
contribution to the sum, since F(l) = F(−l), in addition to the single con-
tribution of F(0). The phase of each reﬂection is now just the (unknown)
positive or negative sign, s(l) = +1 or −1. We use some data measured
a number of years ago for a compound containing a long alkyl chain
and a bromine atom (the detailed molecular structure is not important
here); this crystallizes in a unit cell with one long axis (c), the molecule
being stretched out so that its projection along this axis gives resolved
atoms, Br and several C. There are two molecules per unit cell, appear-
ing as inversions of each other along the two halves of the cell axis. This
projection can be investigated with just the (00l) reﬂections, with the
irrelevant zero indices ignored here.

the reﬂections in Table 8.1 to the one-
dimensional Fourier synthesis, all shown
here with positive sign (zero phase angle);
the reﬂections are in order, with l = 3 at the
top and l = 21 at the bottom.
Table 8.1 lists the observed amplitudes of the measured reﬂections
with l between 3 and 21 (|Fo|), and the amplitudes calculated from
a model structure consisting only of the two symmetry-equivalent Br
atoms (|Fc|, via the one-dimensional equivalent of (8.1)); how these Br
atoms can be found from the data is considered in the next chapter, on
Patterson syntheses. Also given are two sets of signs (reﬂection phases):
the correct signs obtained by calculation from the complete structure
once it is known (true signs), and the signs obtained from the model
containing only the Br atoms (model signs). Below Table 8.1 are shown
in Fig. 8.4 the individual terms |Fo(l)|cos[2π(lz)] that contribute to the
sum in (8.4), ignoring the signs s(l). Carrying out a Fourier synthesis
to obtain the one-dimensional electron density just means adding up
these ‘electron-wave’ contributions with the correct signs. Since there
are 19 terms to add together, the number of possible sign combina-
tions is 219, which is over half a million: not a good case for trial
and error! Several different variants on (8.4) are shown graphically in
Figs. 8.5 to 8.8.

Fc synthesis
Both the amplitudes and the signs are taken from the model structure
(Br atoms only). This essentially just gives back the same model struc-
ture, with two large peaks where the Br atoms were located (Fig. 8.5).
However, there is signiﬁcant regular ripple in the rest of the unit cell; this
is caused by ‘series termination’, the lack of contributions from reﬂec-
tions with l > 21. If these were available and were included, most of the
diagram would be essentially ﬂat. This is not a useful Fourier synthesis!

Fo synthesis, as used in developing
a partial structure solution
Experimental amplitudes |Fo| are combined with the signs (phases)
obtained from the current model structure. The resulting map (Fig. 8.6)
shows the atoms of the model (2 Br), together with new atoms (a num-
ber of smaller peaks corresponding to C atoms in a chain for each
molecule). Note that the model signs are mostly, but not all, correct, so
this electron-density map is not perfect, but it is sufﬁcient to locate the
remaining atoms. The incorrect signs slightly distort the map, produc-
ing rather unequal peak heights for the carbon atoms and overstating
the central dip.

This is a difference map (Fig. 8.7), using the difference between the

atoms in the model no longer appear, so the new atoms stand out more
clearly.

This is the same as the second result, but with all the correct phases.
This gives a more even pattern of peaks for the carbon atoms (Fig. 8.8).
At this stage, with the structure complete, the model structure should
essentially reproduce itself in a standard |Fo| synthesis, and a difference
synthesis should contain no signiﬁcant features.

Patterson syntheses for
structure determination

9.1
Introduction
We wish to convert a measured diffraction pattern into the corre-
sponding crystal structure that produced it experimentally. The process
involved is Fourier transformation, and the mathematical expression for
this was given in the previous chapter, on Fourier syntheses.
ρ(xyz) = 1
V

hkl
|F(hkl)| exp[iφ(hkl)] exp[−2πi(hx + ky + lz)]
(9.1)
This is the form of the equation that explicitly contains the amplitudes
and phases of the structure factors as separate symbols, from which
we can see the fundamental problem we face: the amplitudes |Fo| are
known from the diffraction experiment, but the phases φ are unknown,
so it is not possible to carry out the Fourier synthesis directly. In the
previous chapter we saw that knowledge of part of the structure can
get us started, since it is then possible to calculate approximate phases
and improve our knowledge of the electron density in stages through
modiﬁed versions of (9.1). The question is, how do we make a start? In
chemical crystallography there are two main techniques for solving the
phase problem, which have complementary strengths and applications.
One is the use of so-called direct methods, which attempt to estimate
approximate phases from relationships among the structure factors with
no prior knowledge about the crystal structure itself (except for the dis-
crete atomic nature of matter and its implications for diffraction effects),
and this is considered in the next chapter. The other is the use of the
Patterson synthesis (or Patterson map, or Patterson function), another
variation on (9.1), which can provide information on approximate posi-
tions of some of the atoms in the structure. The Patterson synthesis
ﬁnds most use either when there are a few heavy atoms (atoms with
a considerably higher number of electrons) among many light atoms,
such as in co-ordination complexes of most metals, or when a signiﬁcant
proportion of the molecular structure is expected to have a well-deﬁned

and known rigid internal geometry, such as the characteristic tetracyclic
framework of steroids or other fused polycyclic systems with little or
no conformational ﬂexibility.
In the Patterson synthesis (named after its inventor, A. L. Patterson),
the amplitudes |Fo| in (9.1) are replaced by their squares |Fo|2 and the
unknown phases are simply omitted (effectively all set at zero). An
alternative way of expressing this is that the complex structure factors
F(hkl), which contain both amplitude and phase information (see (8.2)
in Chapter 8) are replaced by the product of each one with its complex
conjugate F∗(hkl). Multiplying any complex number by its complex con-
jugate (which has the same cosine term but the opposite sign for its sine
term) gives a real number, the imaginary terms cancelling out. In this
case the complex exponential also simpliﬁes to a real cosine.

(9.2)
Obviously, with these changes in the Fourier coefﬁcients and omission
of the phases, the result of the synthesis will no longer be the desired
electron density, but it turns out to be closely related to it in what can be
a useful way. The use of the co-ordinates u, v, w instead of x, y, z helps to
emphasize this point; these are still fractions of the unit cell edges and
the Patterson synthesis is a periodic continuous function looking rather
similar to an electron-density distribution and repeated in each unit cell.
Figure 9.1 is an example.
9.2
What the Patterson synthesis means
The nature of the Patterson synthesis and its relationship to the electron
density can be expressed in a number of ways that look rather different
but are essentially equivalent. The peaks in a Patterson map do not
correspond to the positions of individual atoms (i.e. the positions of
atoms relative to the unit cell origin as expressed in their co-ordinates
x, y, z), but instead to vectors between pairs of atoms in the structure
(i.e. the positions of atoms relative to each other). Thus, for every pair

9.2
What the Patterson synthesis means
119
of atoms in the structure with co-ordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2)
there will be a peak in the Patterson map (a maximum in the Patterson
synthesis) at the position (x1 −x2, y1 −y2, z1 −z2) and also one at the
position (x2 −x1, y2 −y1, z2 −z1), each atom giving a vector to the
other. To turn this argument the other way round, every peak observed
in the Patterson map corresponds to a vector between two atoms in the
crystal structure, so a Patterson peak at (u, v, w) means there must be
two atoms whose x co-ordinates differ by u, y co-ordinates differ by v,
and z co-ordinates differ by w. The objective is to work out some atom
co-ordinates by knowing only differences between pairs of them.
Mathematically this can all be expressed in terms of Fourier trans-
forms and convolutions. Multiplying two functions together in direct
space corresponds to a convolution of their Fourier transforms in recip-
rocal space, and vice versa. Calculating the Patterson synthesis involves
taking the product of the diffraction pattern structure factors with their
complex conjugates, so the result is the convolution of the electron den-
sity with its inverse. What this convolution means can be visualized
by adding together n versions of the true electron density, where n is
the number of atoms in the unit cell; for each contribution to the sum,
the whole structure is shifted to put this atom at the origin of the unit
cell and the electron density everywhere is multiplied by the electron
density of the atom at the origin.
P(u, v, w) =

cell
ρ(x, y, z)ρ(u −x, v −y, w −z)dxdydz,
(9.3)
and this is the mathematical equation corresponding to the description
above in terms of vectors between pairs of atoms, because the value of
the Patterson function P will only be large at positions that correspond
to separations between signiﬁcant concentrations of electron density
according to (9.3).
The practical value of this synthesis can be seen by considering some
of the properties that follow from its deﬁnition.
1. There is a vector between every pair of atoms in the structure;
this includes ‘self-vectors’ between each atom and itself, which
obviously have zero length. For n atoms in the unit cell this means
n2 vectors, of which n all coincide at the position (0, 0, 0), the origin
of the unit cell in the Patterson map. All Patterson maps have their
largest peak at the origin. There are n2 −n other peaks, many more
than the number of atoms.
2. Every pair of atoms gives two vectors, A→B and A←B. These
are equal and opposite, so there are two peaks related to each
other by inversion through the origin.All Patterson syntheses have
inversion symmetry, whether or not the crystal structure has. This
consequence can also be seen from the form of (9.2): setting all
phases equal to zero automatically forces an inversion centre. Per-
haps less obvious, but equally true, is that screw axes and glide

120
Patterson syntheses for structure determination
planes in the crystal structure are converted into normal rotation
axes and mirror planes in the Patterson synthesis, all translation
components disappearing. This means the point group symme-
try for a Patterson synthesis is the same as the Laue class for the
diffraction pattern. The primitive or centred nature of the unit cell
of the structure is retained in the Patterson synthesis, so the space
group symmetry of the Patterson map is related to the true space
group of the structure, but there are only 24 possible Patterson
space groups, corresponding to the combinations of the 11 Laue
classes with appropriate permissible unit cell centrings in each of
the crystal systems.
3. Patterson peaks have a similar appearance to electron-density
peaks, but they are about twice as broad as a result of the convo-
lution effect of (9.3). Because of this and the large number of peaks
resulting from the ﬁrst point above, there is a considerable overlap
of peaks, so they are usually not all resolved from each other like
electron-density peaks. Vectors that are approximately or exactly
equal in length and parallel to each other, such as opposite sides
of benzene rings and metal–ligand bonds arranged trans to each
other, will give substantial or complete overlap, further reducing
the number of distinct maxima that can be seen. Symmetry in the
structure also leads to exact overlap of vectors. Thus, Patterson
maps often show large relatively featureless regions.
4. Each peak resulting from a vector between two atoms has a size
proportional to the product of the atomic numbers Z of those two
atoms, just as electron-density peaks are proportional to atomic
numbers in normal Fourier syntheses (ignoring the effects of
atomic displacements, which spread out the electron density some-
what). If the unit cell contains a relatively small number of heavy
atoms among a majority of lighter ones, the peaks corresponding to
vectors between pairs of these heavy atoms will be large and will
stand out clearly from the general unresolved background level
and smaller peaks.
Before going on to consider the two major ways of exploiting these
properties of the Patterson function, we note some small modiﬁcations
to the standard Patterson synthesis expression in (9.2) that can be used,
just as there are variations in Fourier syntheses that incorporate phase
information.
The ﬁrst is that it is possible to remove the large origin peak, so that
peaks corresponding to short vectors are more clearly seen, though this
is not usually a problem. In any case, the fact that the origin peak has
a size proportional to the sum of Z2 for all atoms in the unit cell, on
the same scale as the sizes of other peaks described above, can help to
conﬁrm the identity of the atoms contributing to individual peaks. To
remove the origin peak, |F|2 in (9.2) is replaced by |F|2−⟨|F|2⟩θ, where the
term subtracted is the mean value of |F|2 at this Bragg angle, obtained by
some kind of curve ﬁtting to a plot of |F|2 against (sin θ)/λ, for example.

9.3
Finding heavy atoms from a Patterson map
121
The second modiﬁcation is to sharpen the Patterson function, reduc-
ing the width of the peaks. This is achieved by using |E|2 instead of
|F|2 in (9.3), giving greater relative weight to the higher-angle data
and effectively suppressing the effects of atomic displacements. The
advantage is a better resolution of peaks from each other, but the disad-
vantage is introduction of more noise (spurious small peaks) because of
greater uncertainty in the higher-angle data and the enhanced effects of
series termination. Use of |E|2 −1 as coefﬁcients in the synthesis gives
both sharpening and origin-peak removal simultaneously. Intermediate
degrees of sharpening as a compromise are obtained by using |E||F| or
even √(|E|3|F|) as coefﬁcients.
9.3
Finding heavy atoms from
a Patterson map
If a unit cell contains a small number of heavy atoms together with
a majority of lighter atoms, then the Patterson map will show a rel-
atively small number of large peaks corresponding to heavy–heavy
vectors, prominent above the smaller peaks due to heavy–light vec-
tors and (probably largely unresolved) light–light vectors. The idea is
to deduce a set of heavy-atom positions that explain all the large Patter-
son peaks; these heavy atoms then form a model structure from which
approximate phases can be calculated for Fourier syntheses to develop
the model further, as already described in the previous chapter. There
are generally more vectors providing information than there are atom
positions to be found. Solving a Patterson map is rather like a math-
ematical brain-teaser or a crossword puzzle. Heavy atoms that are in
symmetry-related positions often give Patterson peaks lying in special
positions with co-ordinates equal to 0 or 1/2, which are easily recognized.
This is best illustrated with speciﬁc examples in commonly occurring
space groups.
9.3.1
One heavy atom in the asymmetric unit of P1
In this common case, there are two heavy atoms in the unit cell, related
to each other by inversion symmetry. Their unknown co-ordinates are
(x, y, z) and (−x, −y, −z). The largest Patterson peak is, as always, at
(0, 0, 0). There should be two other prominent peaks, one on each side
of the origin, since the Patterson function is also centrosymmetric. One
has co-ordinates (u, v, w) = (2x, 2y, 2z), because this is the difference
between the sets of co-ordinates of the two heavy atoms; the other has
the same co-ordinates with opposite signs, (−2x, −2y, −2z). It is a triv-
ial matter to divide these by 2 and obtain the position of the unique
heavy atom. Because there are two Patterson peaks, there are two pos-
sible answers, differing only in the signs of the co-ordinates; they are
equally correct, corresponding to different choices of the asymmetric
unit within the unit cell.

122
Patterson syntheses for structure determination
This simplicity, however, conceals the fact that these are not the only
possible solutions. This is because of the periodic nature of both the
crystal structure and the Patterson synthesis. A Patterson peak with
a co-ordinate u is entirely equivalent to another one with co-ordinate
1 + u lying in the next unit cell. Dividing this by 2 gives a different x co-
ordinate for the heavy atom, equal to 1/2 + x relative to the ﬁrst solution,
and this is just as valid. The same applies to the other two co-ordinates
y and z, so there are 8 possible solutions from the peak (u, v, w) and a
further 8 from (−u, −v, −w). These actually correspond to the fact that
there are 8 different inversion centres in the unit cell in space group
P1, so there are 8 possible choices of unit cell origin, for any of which
there are then two equivalent asymmetric units consisting of half a cell.
In general, when any co-ordinate is obtained from a Patterson peak
for two symmetry-related atoms, this ambiguity occurs and there is an
arbitrary choice to be made. When only one unique heavy atom is being
located, the choice is completely unimportant. With two independent
atoms in the asymmetric unit this is a possible source of error, and we
have to ﬁnd a self-consistent solution; we shall return to this point after
looking at some other space groups.
9.3.2
One heavy atom in the asymmetric unit of P21/c
This is another very common case. There are now four symmetry-
equivalent heavy atoms in the unit cell, related to each other and to
those in other unit cells by screw axes, glide planes, and inversion cen-
tres. The equivalent positions can be found in the International Tables,
as follows.
(x, y, z)
(−x, −y, −z)
(x, 1/2 −y, 1/2 + z)
(−x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 −z).
Differences of all pairs of these give 16 vectors (4 × 4), 4 of which are
the self-vector (0, 0, 0). The (u, v, w) co-ordinates of these can be seen in
Table 9.1. Each term in the body of the table is the difference between
the positions given at the column and row heads; wherever −1/2 would
appear, it is replaced by 1/2, since this is entirely equivalent, correspond-
ing to a shift of one unit cell along that axis. A table of this kind,
showing all possible vectors between atoms in general positions, can
be constructed for any space group.

Finding heavy atoms from a Patterson map
123
Inspection of Table 9.1 reveals the following relationships among the
16 vectors. The self-vector (0, 0, 0) appears four times, along the lead-
ing diagonal. There are two appearances of (0, 1/2 + 2y, 1/2) and two of
its centrosymmetric opposite (0, 1/2 −2y, 1/2), with the co-ordinates u
and w having special values of 0 and 1/2, respectively. There are also
two appearances each of the centrosymmetric pairs (2x, 1/2, 1/2 + 2z) and
(−2x, 1/2, 1/2−2z), with v = 1/2. Finally there are four entries with no special
values for their co-ordinates, being (2x, 2y, 2z) and three symmetry-
equivalents of it with some or all signs changed. The number of separate
peaks observed in the Patterson map as a result, excluding the origin
peak, is 8; 4 of them are double the size of the other 4, because they
each consist of two coincident peaks. The arrangement of the 8 peaks
satisﬁes the 2/m monoclinic Laue group symmetry, so there are in fact
only 3 peaks not related to each other by the Patterson symmetry. Each
row and each column of Table 9.1 gives a version of these three peaks,
and this is always the case when such a table is constructed. Only one
column or one row is actually needed, and is formed by subtracting any
one of the space group general positions from all of the other general
positions.
For any space group having rotation and/or reﬂection symmetry
elements (including screw axes and glide planes) there will be Pat-
terson vectors with some special co-ordinate values in the equivalent
of Table 9.1, giving two or more coincident peaks (peaks of double or
higher weight, as we shall designate them). They lie, therefore, in planes
or lines with a concentration of Patterson peaks, and these are known as
Harker planes (or Harker sections) and Harker lines. They are, of course,
particularly easy to recognize because of their special co-ordinate val-
ues and their preponderance of large peaks. It is worth noting that they
also provide a useful indication of the presence of the corresponding
symmetryelementsinthestructure,especiallywhenthesearenotunam-
biguously determined from systematic absences, intensity statistics and
otherearlierobservations,sotheycanplayaroleinspacegroupdetermi-
nation; peaks in the Patterson synthesis are derived from the complete
data set, not just from a particular subset, so they may be more reli-
able than systematic absences, especially for screw axes along short unit
cell edges.
In practice, the peaks observed in the Patterson synthesis are com-
pared with those expected from Table 9.1 and possible vectors between
symmetry-equivalent heavy atoms are identiﬁed. In the Harker section
(u, 1/2, w) there should be one large unique peak, from which x and z co-
ordinates can be calculated, and the y co-ordinate of the heavy atom is
found from the unique peak in the Harker line (0, v, 1/2). A peak should
then also be found at the position (2x, 2y, 2z) to conﬁrm the assignment.
In checking this, it is again necessary to remember that adding or sub-
tracting any multiple of 1/2 is allowed (the usual Patterson ambiguity),
and so is changing the sign of either y, or both of x and z simultaneously
(monoclinic 2/m symmetry). With the single heavy atom located, we
now have a ﬁrst model structure.

One heavy atom in the asymmetric unit
of P212121
We use the same approach as for P21/c. There are four equivalent posi-
tions in the unit cell, from which Table 9.2 can be constructed. Notice
that this is a non-centrosymmetric space group, so it is our ﬁrst example
that does not generate a vector (2x, 2y, 2z).
This gives us 4 × 4 = 16 vectors, of which 3 are unique together
with the origin peak; the Patterson symmetry is mmm, so any peak in a
general position in the Patterson (no special co-ordinate values) would
occur single-weighted in 8 equivalent positions. There are in fact none
of this kind in Table 9.2; all the non-origin peaks lie on Harker sections
with one special co-ordinate (u or v or w = 1/2). The peaks come in sets
of 4 equivalents, all of equal single weight, because each one occurs
just once in the table. The ﬁrst column can be taken as representative.
There should, therefore, be three prominent peaks in the asymmetric
unit of the Patterson map, each having one of its co-ordinates in turn
equal to 1/2. The peak in the (1/2, v, w) section provides heavy atom y and
z co-ordinates; (u, 1/2, w) provides x and z, and (u, v, 1/2) provides x and y.
Each co-ordinate is thus given twice, so we have a consistency check,
allowing as usual for the possible ±1/2 shifts and, in the orthorhombic
case, for a free choice of sign for each of the co-ordinates.
9.3.4
One heavy atom in the asymmetric unit of Pbca
The approach is just the same as before. This time there are eight general
positions in the unit cell, so we produce a table of 64 vectors, the ﬁrst
column of which is shown here as Table 9.3.

eral positions in Pbca.

Note that this space group can be generated from P212121 by addition
of an inversion centre, the glide planes being automatically produced
at the same time by combination of the other symmetry operators. The
symmetry of the Patterson map is still mmm, as for all orthorhombic
structures. Thus, the ﬁrst four entries in the column of vectors here are
just the same as in Table 9.2, and we now add four more. Of these, one
is a general vector (2x, 2y, 2z) resulting from the centrosymmetry, and
the other three lie on Harker lines with two special co-ordinates each.
Inspection of the complete table shows that the result overall for one
heavy atom in a general position in Pbca is as follows: a peak of weight
8 contributing to the origin peak; 6 peaks of weight 4 on Harker lines,

a symmetry-related pair on each of three lines running parallel to the
three cell axes; 12 peaks of weight 2 on Harker sections, symmetry-
related to each other in sets of 4; and 8 peaks of single weight in general
positions, all symmetry-related by allowing all possible combinations of
+ and −signs on the co-ordinates. There is a large amount of redundant
informationfromthesevenpeaksintheasymmetricunitofthePatterson
map, from which the three co-ordinates of the heavy atom can be found
and checked. A similar situation, but with different vectors in detail,
arises for all primitive centrosymmetric orthorhombic space groups.
9.3.5
One heavy atom in the asymmetric unit of P21
This is another non-centrosymmetric space group, but it differs from
P212121 in being polar. This has a particular consequence for structure
solution in such space groups, which can be seen by inspection of the
general positions shown, with their vectors, in Table 9.4.

tions in P21.

Note that the heavy atom y co-ordinate does not appear in any of the
vectors in this table. This is because there are no −y terms in any of the
space group general positions; the space group is polar along the y (or b)
axis,soy disappearsfromallthedifferences.The x andzco-ordinatesofa
heavy atom can be obtained from the one symmetry-independent peak
that should be seen in the Harker section (u, 1/2, w), and any arbitrary
value can be assigned to its y co-ordinate. The Patterson function gives
no information about this co-ordinate, because none is needed.
9.3.6
Two heavy atoms in the asymmetric unit of
P1 and other space groups
Suppose we have two heavy atoms in P1 with co-ordinates (x, y, z)
and (X, Y, Z), together with their centrosymmetric equivalents at
(−x, −y, −z) and (−X, −Y, −Z). These four atoms give 16 vectors as
shown in Table 9.5. Here, we use a shorthand notation in which x =
x + X and x = x −X.
Apart from the quadruple contribution to the origin peak, this gives
us pairs of double-weight peaks at ±(x, y, z) and at ±(x, y, z),
and pairs of single-weight peaks at ±(2x, 2y, 2z) and at ±(2X, 2Y, 2Z),
a total of 4 peaks in the asymmetric unit of the Patterson map, all of
them with general co-ordinates. From the expected different peak sizes
and the sum and difference relationships among the various peaks, it

Patterson syntheses for structure determination
should be easy to work out which peaks are which and so generate the
co-ordinates of both unique heavy atoms.
Asimilar procedure can be used in other space groups when there are
two independent heavy atoms. It is easier (despite the larger number
of peaks present overall), however, when Harker sections and lines are
present, as these provide information from which the separate atoms
can ﬁrst be located, and the peaks in general positions can then be used
to resolve the usual ambiguities and cross-check the assignments.
9.4
Patterson syntheses giving more than one
possible solution, and other problems
Is it always this easy? Unfortunately not. There are a number of things
that can go wrong. To illustrate one of these, go back to the example of
a single heavy atom in P21/c. Suppose this has a y co-ordinate close to
1/4; this is not a special position in the unit cell. The vectors in the ﬁrst
column of Table 9.1 are now: (0, 0, 0); (2x, 1/2, 2z); (0, 1, 1/2); (2x, 1/2, 1/2 + 2z).
The third of these is equivalent to (0, 0, 1/2). Spotting that this is just a
particular case of (0, v, 1/2) is not a problem, but we have two peaks in
the Harker section (u, 1/2, w), one of which is a genuine Harker peak and
the other is actually a general peak that lies here by chance. How do we
know which is which? AHarker section peak is expected to be twice the
size,butthisdoesnothelp,becauseinspectionofthefulltableshowsthat
another general position is (2x, −1/2, 2z) and this is exactly the same place
as the ﬁrst general position, so the peak sizes turn out to be the same.
Choosing the peaks the wrong way round (Harker versus general) gives
us the same x and y co-ordinates for the heavy atom as the correct choice,
but a different z co-ordinate, increased or decreased by 1/4. The Patterson
map can thus be interpreted to give two different possible positions for
the heavy atom that are not equivalent to each other. One of them will
probably serve as a good enough model structure, but the other will not,
giving completely incorrect phases and no further development of the
structure.
Problems of this kind can arise in many space groups when heavy
atoms have one or more co-ordinates close to 1/4 or some other values
that give general vector peaks indistinguishable from Harker peaks.
This actually occurs quite often, particularly for metal co-ordination
complexes, because these tend to have the metal as the heavy atom,
sitting more or less in the centre of a molecule, and the packing of
the molecules around symmetry elements and at regular intervals on
a lattice frequently gives rational fractions as co-ordinates. Beware of
Patterson solutions with co-ordinates close to 0, 1/4 and 1/2 for this reason;
they may not be unique solutions!
Another problem can be seen from the example (e) above, where one
heavy atom is found in the polar space group P21. If this single atom
is used as a model structure, then this model actually has higher sym-
metry than P21; its space group is P21/m, with a mirror plane passing

9.4
Patterson syntheses giving more than one possible solution, and other problems
127
through the heavy atom, and this is centrosymmetric instead of non-
centrosymmetric. Phases calculated from the single heavy atom will all
be 0 or 180◦, and the resulting Fourier synthesis based on these phases
with the observed amplitudes will retain the false extra symmetry, so
it will probably show some features of the correct structure together
with a superimposed equally strong reﬂected image of it. This pseudo-
symmetry hastobebrokenbycarefulselectionofappropriatenewatoms
from only one of the two images. An alternative approach is to try to
ﬁnd at least one extra atom from lower peaks of the Patterson map cor-
responding to heavy–light vectors; inclusion of this in the ﬁrst model
breaks the false symmetry and should make the true structure image
clearer than any superimposed mirror image.
All the above examples apply to heavy atoms in general positions,
so that all the expected vectors appear in the Patterson maps. In many
structures, especially for co-ordination complexes, heavy atoms lie in
special positions: on rotation axes, mirror planes, or inversion centres.
Different vector tables have to be drawn up in such cases, which contain
correspondingly fewer rows and columns, and one or more of the heavy
atom co-ordinates will be ﬁxed by the known positions of the symmetry
elements.Although this situation should be expected in many cases, as a
result of calculating the unit cell contents when the cell and space group
are determined, it can be unexpected; for example, four heavy atoms
per unit cell in P21/c usually means they lie in general positions, but
they may instead be on two pairs of equivalent inversion centres, with
all the co-ordinates equal to 0 or 1/2. This will be indicated by a Patterson
map with its largest non-origin peaks at positions with all co-ordinates
of 0 and 1/2, and no large peaks anywhere else on the Harker sections
and lines or in general positions.
There are pairs (and more) of space groups that can not be distin-
guished from systematic absences alone and for both of which a solution
may be possible from a Patterson synthesis. One of the most common
examples of this is the choice between the non-centrosymmetric (and
polar) space group Pna21 and the centrosymmetric space group Pnam
(conventionally taken as Pnma, but this involves exchanging two of the
cell axes). These both have the same systematic absences. If the unit
cell contains four molecules, each with one heavy atom, then these lie
either in general positions in Pna21 or in special positions in Pnam;
one of the available special positions is on the mirror plane (assum-
ing the molecule has a shape consistent with mirror symmetry). The set
of vectors expected for four heavy atoms in general positions in Pna21
is identical to that for four heavy atoms on mirror planes in Pnam, so
the largest Patterson peaks can not be used to decide between the two
possibilities. With a heavy atom present, possibly on a special position,
intensity statistics are unreliable. Examination of lower Patterson peaks
may help, since the centrosymmetric space group should give plenty of
vectors (0, 0, w) corresponding to pairs of atoms related by reﬂection,
but often it is necessary to try developing the structure in both space

128
Patterson syntheses for structure determination
groups and see which is successful; if they both work, the higher sym-
metry is taken as correct, as discussed earlier in Chapter 4 on space
group determination. As a general observation, heavy atoms in special
positions can lead to complications in solving Patterson syntheses.
Of course, the various procedures described above for these different
space groups are all closely related and they are capable of automation
to some degree in computer programs. Some such programs can also
deal effectively with pseudo-symmetry problems and atoms in special
positions. Human interpretation of a Patterson map remains, however,
often a very effective method, and a fascinating challenge. It is a pity
if this skill dies out among crystallographers through over-reliance on
black-box programs.
9.5
Patterson search methods
Acompletely different use can be made of Patterson syntheses, for which
the presence of heavy atoms is not necessary. What is needed for suc-
cess here is a part of the molecule for which the shape (bond lengths,
angles and conformation) is either known in advance or can be con-
ﬁdently predicted. Examples are rigid polycyclic systems such as the
four characteristic fused rings of steroids, a norbornane bicyclic nucleus
as in camphor derivatives, a porphyrin, fused polycyclic aromatics, or
polyhedral cages, as illustrated in Fig. 9.2. Appropriate geometry may
be known from previously determined structures (including the use of
the Cambridge Structural Database) or from theoretical and molecular
modelling calculations.
A molecular fragment of this kind will have a characteristic pattern
of vectors for all pairs of its constituent atoms. The pattern is com-
plex and probably contains considerable overlap of vectors, but it will
vary little for structures containing this particular fragment. It should

appear, mixed up with other vectors, in the Patterson map. Finding
it and deducing from it where atoms of the search fragment actually
lie in the crystal structure is a pattern-matching exercise well suited
to computer programming, and numerous Patterson search programs
are available. The details of how they work vary considerably, they are
largely automatic in operation, and they generally incorporate sophisti-
cated extensions and variations of the basic method, but the principles
are fairly simple. Two stages are involved.
9.5.1
Rotation search
This aims to ﬁnd the orientation of the search fragment by matching its
internal vectors to those found relatively close to the origin of the Patter-
son map unit cell, which contains mainly intramolecular vectors rather
than intermolecular ones. Effectively, the calculated pattern of vectors
for the search fragment is placed at the origin of the Patterson map and
is rotated systematically in three dimensions to ﬁnd the best ﬁt to the
observed vectors (large values in the Patterson function, not necessarily
peak maxima, because of overlap). Various models for rotation are used,
and it is not necessary to consider all possible orientations, because of
symmetry in the map and in the model (this will differ from case to
case). Even for a fragment with no internal symmetry and a triclinic
space group, only half the total sphere of rotation needs to be searched,
and this fraction reduces with higher symmetry, for example to one
eighth for an orthorhombic structure. For each orientation to be tested,
the values of the Patterson function at the ends of all the model vectors
are examined and compared with what is expected; one simple way of
doing this is to multiply together the expected and observed values at
each vector end and add up the products, though there are alternative
criteria. Orientations giving a large sum are good candidates for the cor-
rect orientation of the search fragment. The most promising one or a few
are selected for the next stage.
9.5.2
Translation search
Except for space group P1, where any point can arbitrarily be chosen
as the unit cell origin, it is now necessary to place the correctly ori-
ented fragment in its right location in the unit cell, i.e. to establish its
position relative to the symmetry elements. In principle (although most
programs do not actually carry out the process in this way), this is done
by placing the fragment successively at different points on a grid; for
each position, all the symmetry equivalents are generated, intermolecu-
lar vectors (between all pairs of symmetry-related fragments) are found,
and these are compared with the Patterson map in a way analogous to
that used in the rotation search, but also using longer vectors. The correct
position should give a high sum of products. Again, it is not necessary
to search the whole unit cell, but only a fraction of it depending on the
space group symmetry, and no search is needed at all along any polar

130
Patterson syntheses for structure determination
axis (e.g. all three axes in P1, the b-axis in P21), because the origin can
be chosen arbitrarily in such directions. Positions can also be immedi-
ately discarded if they lead to impossibly short intermolecular contacts,
without a full calculation.
If the search fragment constitutes a signiﬁcant proportion of the total
electron density of the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure, the result
of this Patterson search procedure should be a model structure adequate
to give reasonable approximate phases and hence develop the structure
further.

Direct methods of
crystal-structure
determination
Peter Main
Many methods of structure determination have been termed ‘direct’
(e.g. Patterson function, Fourier methods) in that, under favourable cir-
cumstances, it is possible to proceed in logical steps directly from the
measured X-ray intensities to a complete solution of the crystal struc-
ture. However, the term ‘direct’ is usually reserved for those methods
that attempt to derive the structure factor phases, electron density or
atomic co-ordinates by mathematical means from a single set of X-ray
intensities. Of these possibilities, the determination of phases is the most
important for small-molecule crystallography.
10.1
Amplitudes and phases
The importance of phases in structure determination is obvious, but it
is instructive to examine their importance relative to the amplitudes. To
do this, we use the convolution theorem, which is set out inAppendixA.
It is not necessary to understand the mathematics in detail, but we are
going to use the same relationship among the functions seen in Section
A.10.
Let us regard a structure factor as the product of an amplitude |F(h)|
and a phase factor exp(iφ(h)), where h is a reciprocal space vector, the
set of three indices being represented here by a single symbol. We will
call the Fourier transform of |F(h)| the ‘amplitude synthesis’ and the
Fourier transform of the function exp(iφ(h)) the ‘phase synthesis’. The
convolution theorem gives:

where * is the convolution operator. The amplitude synthesis must look
rather like the Patterson function with a large origin peak, and its convo-
lution with the phase synthesis will put this large peak at the site of each
peak in the phase synthesis. The phase synthesis must therefore contain
peaks at atomic sites for the convolution to give the electron density. It is
thus the phases rather than the amplitudes that give information about
atomic positions in an electron-density map. A good illustration of this
was given by Ramachandran and Srinivasan (1961), who calculated an
electron-density map using the phases from one structure (A) and the
amplitudes from another (B). The map, in Fig. 10.1, shows the electron-
densitypeakscorrespondingtotheatomicpositionsinstructureArather
than B. Clearly, of the two problems Nature could have given us, the
phase problem is much more difﬁcult than the amplitude problem.
10.2
The physical basis of direct methods
If the amplitude and phase of a structure factor were independent quan-
tities, direct methods could not calculate phases from observed structure
amplitudes. Fortunately, structure factor amplitudes and phases are not
independent, but are linked through a knowledge of the electron den-
sity. Thus, if phases are known, amplitudes can be calculated to conform
to our information on the electron density and, similarly, phases can be
calculated from amplitudes. If nothing at all is known about the electron
density, neither phases nor amplitudes can be calculated from the other.
However, something is always known about the electron density, oth-
erwise we could not recognize the right answer when it is obtained.
Characteristics and features of the correct electron density can often be
expressed as mathematical constraints on the function ρ(x) that is to be
determined. Since ρ(x) is related to the structure factors by a Fourier
transformation, constraints on the electron density impose correspond-
ingconstraintsonthestructurefactors.Becausethestructureamplitudes
are known, most constraints restrict the values of structure factor phases

10.3
Constraints on the electron density
135
and, in favourable cases, are sufﬁcient to determine the phase values
directly.
10.3
Constraints on the electron density
The correct electron density must always possess certain features like
discrete atomic peaks (at sufﬁciently high resolution) and can never
possess other features such as negative atoms. The electron-density con-
straints that may be or have been used in structure determination are
set out in Table 10.1. Constraints that operate over the whole cell are
generally more powerful than those that affect only a small volume.
10.3.1
Discrete atoms
The ﬁrst entry in the table, that of discrete atoms, is always available,
since it is the very nature of matter. To make use of this information, we
remove the effects of the atomic shape from the Fo and convert them
to E values, the normalized structure factors. The E values are there-
fore closely related to the Fourier coefﬁcients of a point-atom structure.
When they are used in the various phase-determining formulae, the
effect is to strengthen the phase constraints so the electron-density map
should always contain atomic peaks. The convolution theorem shows
the relationships among all these quantities:

This relationship assumes all the peaks are the same shape, which is

The left-hand side is a Karle–Hauptman determinant, which may be of
any order, and the whole expression gives the set of Karle–Hauptman
inequalities. Note that the elements in any single row or column deﬁne
the complete determinant. These elements may be any set of structure
factors as long as they are all different. Since the normalized structure
factors E(h) and E(−h) are complex conjugates of each other, the deter-
minant is seen to possess Hermitian symmetry, i.e. its transpose is equal
to its complex conjugate.

The only term in this expression that is phase dependent is the last one
on the left-hand side. Therefore, for sufﬁciently large Es, the inequality

positive.

of the Fourier component E(h) lie on the full lines, the minima will
lie on the dashed lines and vice versa. If all three reﬂections E(h), E(k)
and E(h–k) are strong and the electron density is to be positive, the
atoms must lie in positions that are near maxima for all three compo-
nents simultaneously. Examples of such positions are labelled A, B, C
and D in Fig. 10.2. If most atoms in the structure are at positions of
type A, E(h), E(k) and E(h–k) will all be strong and positive. If most
atoms are at positions of type B, the three reﬂections will still be strong,
but both E(k) and E(h–k) will be negative. These results are set out in
Table 10.2 together with signs obtained when most atoms are at sites of
type C or D. In each case, it is seen that the product of the three signs
is positive.

Again, for a centrosymmetric structure and under the special conditions
that |E(h + k)| = |E(k + l)| = 0, the expansion of the determinant gives
the mathematical form:
terms independent of phase −2E(−h)E(−k)E(−l)E(h + k+l) ≥0.
(10.8)
By cyclic permutation of the indices h, k and l, two similar determi-
nants can be set up. Putting |E(h+k)| = |E(k+l)| = |E(h+l)| = 0, and with
large enough amplitudes for |E(h)|, |E(k)|, |E(l)|, |E(h+k+l)|, these can
prove that the term E(h)E(k)E(l)E(−h −k −l) must be negative.
10.3.3
Random atomic distribution
The constraint of non-negative electron density is only capable of
restricting those phases that actually make ρ(x) negative for some x
for some value of the phase. This will be possible if the structure fac-
tor in question represents a signiﬁcant fraction of the scattering power.

However, this is less likely to occur the larger the structure, and a
point is soon reached where no phase information can be obtained for
any structure factor. A more powerful constraint is therefore required
that operates on the whole of the electron density no matter what
its value.
This is achieved by combining the ﬁrst two constraints in Table 10.1
to produce the third entry, where the structure is assumed to con-
sist of a random distribution of atoms. The mathematical analysis
gives a probability distribution for the phases rather than merely
allowed and disallowed values. The probability distribution for a non-
centrosymmetric structure equivalent to the inequality (10.6) is shown
in Fig. 10.3 and is expressed mathematically as
P(φ(h, k)) = exp[κ(h, k) cos(φ(h, k))]
2I0(κ(h, k))
,
(10.9)
where κ(h, k) = 2N1/4|E(−h)E(h −k)E(k)| and φ(h, k) = φ(−h) +
φ(h −k) + φ(k). The number of atoms in the unit cell is N and φ(h) is
the phase of E(h), i.e. E(h) = |E(h)| exp(iφ(h)). It can be seen that the
value of φ(h, k) is more likely to be close to 0 than to π, giving rise to
the phase relationship φ(−h) + φ(h–k) + φ(k) ≈0(modulo2π), i.e.
φ(h) ≈φ(h −k) + φ(k),
(10.10)
where the symbol ≈means ‘probably equals’. The width of the distri-
bution is controlled by the value of κ(h,k). Large values give a narrow
distribution and hence a greater likelihood that φ(h,k) is close to 0, i.e.
tighter constraints on the phases.

Constraints on the electron density

10.3.4
Maximum value of ∫ρ3(x)dV
The fourth entry in Table 10.1 is a powerful constraint. It clearly operates
over the whole of the unit cell and not just over a restricted volume. It
discriminates against negative density and encourages the formation
of positive peaks, both expected features of the true electron density.
This leads directly to probability relationships among phases and to the
tangent formula, both of which have formed the basis of direct methods
to the present day.
To obtain the tangent formula, the electron density in ∫ρ3(x)dV is
expressed as a Fourier summation, differentiated with respect to φ(h)
and equated to zero to obtain the maximum. A rearrangement of the
result gives
tan(φ(h)) ≈

k |E(k)E(h −k)| sin(φ(k) + φ(h −k))

k |E(k)E(h −k)| cos(φ(k) + φ(h −k)).
(10.11)
This is expressed more concisely and with less ambiguity as
φ(h) ≈phase of

k
E(k)E(h −k)

.
(10.12)
Note that a single term in the tangent formula summation gives the
phase relationship (10.10). Indeed, the tangent formula can also be
derived from (10.9) by multiplying together the probability distribu-
tions with a common value of h and with different k and rearranging
the result to give the most likely value of φ(h).
10.3.5
Equal atoms
The ﬁfth entry in Table 10.1 has been included because of its extremely
close relationship to the tangent formula in (10.11). In a large proportion
of crystals, the atoms may be regarded as being equal. For example,
in a crystal containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen atoms
only, the hydrogen atoms can be ignored and the remaining atoms are
approximately equal. This constraint was used by Sayre to develop an
equation that gives exact relationships among the structure factors. If
the electron density is squared, it will contain equal peaks in the same
positions as the original density, but the peak shapes will have changed.
This is expressed in terms of structure factors as
F(h) = (h)
V

k
F(k)F(h −k),
(10.13)
where (h) is the scattering factor of the squared atom.
Sayre’s equation has had a profound inﬂuence on the development
of direct methods. It is very closely related to the Karle–Hauptman

140
Direct methods of crystal-structure determination
inequalities and the tangent formula mentioned earlier. It is also used
as a means of phase determination and reﬁnement for macromolecules.
10.3.6
Maximum entropy
The sixth entry in Table 10.1 gives a measure of the entropy or infor-
mation content of the electron density. It operates on the whole of the
electron density and completely forbids negative regions. Maximizing
the entropy of the electron density is a means of dealing with incomplete
information, such as missing phases. A maximum-entropy calculation
produces a new map, which has made no assumptions about the miss-
ing data and is therefore an unbiased estimate of the electron density,
given all available information. This very promising technique has a
number of important applications in crystallography, mainly in the area
of structure reﬁnement rather than structure determination. See Chapter
11 for further information on maximum-entropy methods.
10.3.7
Equal molecules and ρ(x) = const.
Entries 7 and 8 in Table 10.1 have both found use in macromolecu-
lar crystallography. When the same molecule occurs more than once in
the asymmetric unit of a crystal, this immediately introduces the con-
straint that the electron density of the two molecules should be the same.
The systematic application of this constraint constitutes the standard
technique of molecular replacement in macromolecular crystallography.
There is little deﬁnite structure in the solvent regions of a macromolec-
ular crystal, making the electron density almost constant outside the
molecule. This information is exploited in the solvent-ﬂattening tech-
nique. This has been developed into a general density modiﬁcation
technique, which also includes Sayre’s equation and other constraints
and it is now in common use to improve the electron-density maps of
protein molecules.
10.3.8
Structure invariants
We have seen from the inequality relationship (10.6) that electron-
density constraints do not necessarily give the phases of individual
structure factors. Instead, we obtain the value of a combination of
phases. The same combination of phases occurs in the phase probabil-
ity formula (10.9), the tangent formula (10.11) and in Sayre’s equation
(10.13).
The three structure factors are related such that the sum of their
diffraction indices is 0 and structure-factor products that satisfy this cri-
terion are known as structure invariants. Their special property is that
the phase of the product is independent of origin position. The phase
of a structure factor depends upon origin position, but its amplitude
does not. Since only structure factor amplitudes feature in the phase-
determining formulae, they can only deﬁne other quantities that are

10.3
Constraints on the electron density
141
independent of origin position. Hence, the phase combination must be a
structureinvariant.Inordertodeterminephasesforindividualstructure
factors, both the origin and enantiomorph must be deﬁned ﬁrst.
10.3.9
Structure determination
Direct methods of structure determination have become popular
because they can be fully automated and are therefore easy to use.
Now that the main formulae for phase determination have been pre-
sented, it remains to see how they are used in the determination of
crystal structures. Computer programs that solve crystal structures in
this way are readily available, and such a program will normally carry
out the following operations.
(a) Calculate normalized structure amplitudes, |E(h)|, from observed
amplitudes |Fo(h)|. This is the rescaling of the Fo described in (10.3). It
is normal also to use it to ﬁnd the absolute scale of the Fs and produce
intensity statistics as an aid to space group determination. Care must be
taken in the estimation of Es for low-angle reﬂections.
(b) Set up phase relationships. Sets of three structure factors related as
in (10.10) are identiﬁed and recorded for later use. Each such relationship
is a single term in the tangent formula sum (10.11). Since this summation
may be performed thousands of times, it is efﬁcient to have all the terms
already set up. In addition, 4-phase structure invariants of the type seen
in (10.8) are also set up for later use.
(c) Find the reﬂections to be used for phase determination. The phases
of only the strongest |E|s can be determined with acceptable accuracy.
In addition, each structure factor must be present in as large a number
of phase relationships as possible. These two criteria are used to choose
the subset of structure factors whose phases are to be determined.
(d) Assign starting phases. In order to perform the tangent formula
summation (10.11), the phases of the structure factors in the summation
must be known. Initially they may be assigned random values or phases
calculated from an approximate electron-density map.
(e) Phase determination and reﬁnement. The starting phases are used
in the tangent formula to determine new phase values. The process is
then iterated until the phases have converged to stable values. With
random starting phases, this is unlikely to yield correct phase values, so
it is repeated many times as in a Monte Carlo procedure.
(f) Calculate ﬁgures of merit. Each set of phases obtained in (e) is used
in the calculation of ﬁgures of merit. These are simple functions of the
phases that can be calculated quickly and will give an indication of the
quality of the phase set.
(g) Calculate and interpret the electron-density map. The best phase
sets as indicated by the ﬁgures of merit are used to calculate electron-
density maps. These are examined and interpreted in terms of the
expected molecular structure by applying simple stereochemical criteria
to the peaks found. Often, the best map according to the ﬁgures of merit
will reveal most of the atomic positions.

is the expected intensity (also written as ⟨I⟩) of the h reﬂection. The best
way of estimating ⟨I⟩is as a spherical average of the actual intensities. In
practice, the reﬂections are divided into ranges of (sin θ)/λ and averages
taken of intensity and (sin θ)/λ in each range. Reﬂection multiplicities
and also the effects of space group symmetry on intensities must be
taken into account when the averages are calculated. Sampling errors
can be decreased at low angles by using overlapping ranges of (sin θ/λ).
Interpolation between the calculated values of ⟨I⟩is aided if they can
be plotted on a straight line, which is approximately true if a Wilson
plot is used. Interpolation between the points on the plot can be done
quite satisfactorily by ﬁtting a curve locally to three or four points. This
is repeated for different sets of points along the plot.
For best results, it is essential that the interpolated values of ⟨I⟩follow
the actual calculated points even if these depart greatly from a straight
line.SpecialcaremustbetakenincalculatingEsatlowangles.Iftheseare
systematically over-estimated this could easily result in failure to solve
apparently simple structures. These Es are normally involved in more
phase relationships than other reﬂections and therefore have a big inﬂu-
ence on phase determination. The number of strong Es chosen for phase
determination is normally about 4 × (number of independent atoms) +
100. More than this may be needed for triclinic or monoclinic crystals.
10.3.11
Setting up phase relationships
Care should be taken to restrict the search for phase relationships to
the unique ones only. However, in space groups other than triclinic,
the same relationship may be set up more than once because of the
symmetry operations. Such symmetry-related relationships should be
summed so that the tangent formula automatically gives the correct
symmetry phase restrictions. Normally about 15 times as many phase
relationships as reﬂections should be found. If there are fewer than 10
times as many, more can be set up by including a few extra reﬂections.
The number of 3-phase relationships set up is roughly proportional to
the cube of the number of Es used.
10.3.12
Finding reﬂections for phase determination
The phases of only the largest Es are usually determined and not all
of these can be determined with acceptable reliability. It is therefore
useful at this stage to eliminate about 10% of those reﬂections whose

10.3
Constraints on the electron density
143
phases are most poorly deﬁned by the tangent formula. An estimate of
the reliability of each phase is obtained from α(h):

and the standard deviation, σ(h), is shown in Fig. 10.4. From (10.14)
it can be seen that α(h) can only be calculated when the phases are
known. However, an estimate of α(h) can be obtained from the known
distribution of 3-phase structure invariants (10.9). A sufﬁciently good
approximation to the estimated α(h) is given by

in turn until the desired number remain.

Direct methods of crystal-structure determination
10.3.13
Assignment of starting phases
All of the phases to be determined are assigned initial random values,
which also serve to deﬁne the origin and enantiomorph of the subse-
quent electron density. It is not expected that starting phases assigned
in this way will always lead to a correct set of phases after reﬁnement,
so the procedure is repeated a number of times as in a Monte Carlo
technique. The number of such phase sets is normally between 30 and
200, but many more (or fewer) may be needed for some structures. Only
one of these needs to be correct (and identiﬁed) for the structure to be
solved. It may sometimes help if the starting phases are calculated from
a random atomic distribution or perhaps one containing parts of the
molecule available from a previous calculation, thus starting closer to
the correct answer than a purely random guess.
10.3.14
Phase determination and reﬁnement
The tangent formula and associated variance (10.15) are only correct
under the assumption that the phases used in the calculation are correct.
This is normally far from the truth. Acrude attempt at correcting for this
is to weight the terms in the summation so the tangent formula becomes
φ(h) = phase of

k
w(k)w(h −k)E(k)E(h −k),
(10.17)
where w(h) is the weight associated with φ(h). The correct weight is
inversely proportional to the variance and, to an adequate approxima-
tion, this is proportional to α(h) deﬁned in (10.14).
Afurther improvement to the tangent formula is to include additional
terms whose most likely phase is π. These are the non-centrosymmetric
equivalent of the relationship (10.8) and are known as ‘negative quar-
tets’. They prevent all phases from reﬁning to zero in space groups such
as P1 that contain no translational symmetry elements. The modiﬁed
formula is
φ(h) = phase of {α(h) −gη(h)},
(10.18)
with η(h) = N−1 |E(h)| 
kl E(−k)E(−l)E(h + k + l).
α(h) is deﬁned in (10.14) and g is an arbitrary scale factor to balance
the effect of the two terms α(h) and η(h). The terms in the η summation
are chosen such that the amplitudes |E(h + k)|, |E(k + l)| and |E(h + l)|
are all extremely small or zero.
10.3.15
Figures of merit
The correct set of phases needs to be identiﬁed among the large number
of incorrect phase sets. This is done by ﬁgures of merit, which are func-
tions of the phases that can be rapidly calculated to give an indication

10.3

of their quality. Among the most useful are the following.
(a)
Rα =

h
|α(h) −αe(h)|
 
h
αe(h).
(10.19)
This is a residual between the actual and the estimated α values. The
correct phases should make Rα small, but so do many incorrect phase
sets. This is a better discriminator against wrong phases that make Rα
large.
(b)

.
(10.20)
The summation over k includes the strong Es for which phases have
been determined and the indices h are given by those reﬂections for
which |E(h)| is very small. The numerator should therefore be small for
the correct phases and will be much larger if the phases are systemat-
ically wrong. The denominator normalizes ψ0 to an expected value of
unity.
(c)
NQUAL =

h
α(h).η(h)
 
h
|α(h)||η(h)|.
(10.21)
NQUAL measures the consistency between the two summations in
(10.18) and should have a low value for good phases. Correct phases are
expected to give a value of −1.
To enable the computer to choose the best phase sets according to the
ﬁgures of merit, a combined ﬁgure of merit is normally calculated. This
is a sum of the scaled versions of the separate ﬁgures of merit and is
usually the best indicator of good phases.
10.3.16
Interpretation of maps
Electron-density maps are calculated using the best sets of phases as
indicated by the ﬁgures of merit. The Fourier coefﬁcients of these are
normally Es rather than Fs because these are more readily available at
this stage and they give sharper peaks. The slight disadvantage is that
they also give a noisier background to the map. However, E-maps are
usually preferred over F-maps.
Peaks in the maps should correspond to atomic positions but, because
of systematic errors in the phases, there may be spurious peaks or no
peaks where some atoms should be. It is normally sufﬁcient to apply
simple stereochemical criteria to identify chemically sensible molecular
fragments. These may be displayed in a plot of peak positions on the
least-squares plane of the molecule, from which most of the molecule
will be recognized.

146
Direct methods of crystal-structure determination
10.3.17
Completion of the structure
If some atoms are missing from the map, the standard method of ﬁnding
them is to use Fourier reﬁnement (see Chapter 8). Phases calculated from
the known atoms are used with weighted amplitudes to obtain the next
map. Usually, one or two iterations of this are sufﬁcient to complete
the structure. An alternative is to make use of all the diffraction data in
Sayre’sequationtogetherwithdensitymodiﬁcationtoimprovethemap.
This is normally used on macromolecular maps, but it is very successful
for small molecules also. It will even convert an uninterpretable map
into one in which most of the structure can be seen and the advantage
is that it is all done automatically by the computer.

phase relationship (we omit the l index, since it is always
zero for these reﬂections).
The problem is that phases must be assigned to the
structure factors before they can be added up. Since this
projection is centrosymmetric, phases must be 0 or π
radians (0 or 180◦), i.e. E must be given a sign + or −,
but there are 228 combinations of these values, and your
chance of getting an interpretable map is small! Fortu-
nately, the planes giving strong |E| values are related
by enough relationships to give us a unique, or almost
unique, solution. The main relationship used is that for
large values of |E|, say |E1|, |E2| and |E3| all > 1.5, if:
h1 + h2 + h3 = k1 + k2 + k3 (= l1 + l2 + l3) = 0,
then: φ1 + φ2 + φ ≈0. Additional help is given by the
symmetry of the structure, illustrated in Fig. 10.6.
The plane group (two-dimensional space group) is
pgg, with glide lines perpendicular to both axes, and
there are four alternative positions for the origin: 0,0;
0,1/2; 1/2,0; and 1/2,1/2. This means that two phases may be
arbitrarily ﬁxed from any two of the parity groups g,u;
u,g; or u,u (g and u mean even and odd, respectively,
for the indices h and k), since, for example, shifting the
origin by half a unit cell along a will shift the phase of
all structure factors with h odd by π. Another result of
the symmetry is that planes with indices h, k are related
to h, −k or −h, k by the glide lines. The structure ampli-
tudes must be the same for these, and the phases must be
related, although they are not always the same. If h and
k are both even or both odd, φ(h, k) = φ(−h, k). If, how-
ever, one is odd and one even, φ(h, k) = π + φ(−h, k).
See the examples given for (10.23) and (10.33) in the dia-
grams. In other words, if we have a sign for a particular

An introduction to
maximum entropy
Peter Main
When crystallographers talk about maximum entropy, they are usually
referring to a technique for extracting as much information as possible
from incomplete data. The missing data could be structure-factor phases
or perhaps some intensities where they overlap in a powder diffraction
pattern. In this chapter we will look at the ideas behind the technique.
11.1
Entropy
Entropy is a concept used in thermodynamics to describe the state of
order of a system. A large body of mathematics has grown up around it,
and since the same mathematics occurs elsewhere in science, the vocab-
ulary of entropy has gone with it. Apart from thermodynamics itself,
the ﬁelds to beneﬁt most from these ideas are:
1. information theory: entropy measures the amount of information
in a message. The lower the entropy, the more information there is;
2. probability theory: entropy measures the change in probabil-
ity upon altering the conditions under which the probability is
estimated; a low value of entropy corresponds to extremes of
probability;
3. image processing: entropy measures the amount of information in
an image.
An increase in entropy means going from a less likely state to a more
likely one. Examples of increasing entropy may be that the tempera-
tures of two bodies become more nearly equal upon thermal contact,
a message becomes slightly garbled upon transmission, or probabili-
ties become less extreme because the information on which they are
based has become outdated. In each case, you have to add something to
the system to reverse the natural trend and thus decrease the entropy.
Entropy naturally increases.

An illustration of this is the unlikely event portrayed in Fig. 11.1. There

pile than there are to produce a useful shed. A random rearrangement
of the wood is therefore more likely to produce the high-entropy pile
than the low-entropy shed.
11.2
Maximum entropy
When entropy is maximized, it implies that all information has been
removed: the message tells you nothing, everything has the same prob-
ability, and the image is completely ﬂat. This is a fairly useless state to
be in, but that is not the way in which maximum entropy is used as a
numerical technique.
Consider the application of maximum entropy to help form an image
of a crystal structure, i.e. to produce as good an electron density map
as the data will allow. Usually the data are both inaccurate (experi-
mental error) and incomplete (low resolution, no phases, overlapped
reﬂections), giving the possibility of an inﬁnite number of maps that are
consistent with the observed diffraction pattern.
How do you generate an acceptable map out of the inﬁnite number of
possibilities? Maximum entropy tries to do this by demanding that the
map contains as little information as possible, i.e. its entropy is at a max-
imum, subject to the constraints imposed by the experimental data. This
means that whatever information the map does contain is demanded by
the data and is not there as a by-product of the numerical method or a
hidden assumption. It also means that it can make no assumptions at all
about the missing information and so produces as unbiased an estimate
of the true map as possible.
11.2.1
Calculations with incomplete data
To illustrate how to deal with incomplete data, let us imagine we have
the following information:
1. one third of all scientists make direct use of crystallographic data;
let us call them crystallographers;
2. one quarter of all scientists are left-handed.
Now we pose the question: what proportion of all scientists are left-
handed crystallographers?
The information given about left-handedness and crystallographic
scientists is insufﬁcient to answer the question precisely, but let us see
how far we can go towards a sensible answer. The problem may be set
out as in Table 11.1(a), where a is the proportion of left-handed crystallo-
graphers, d is the proportion of right-handed other scientists, and so on.
The information tells us that:
a + b = 1
3;
a + c = 1
4; and a + b + c + d = 1.

Using these three equations, we can eliminate b, c and d, and put
everything in terms of the single variable a as in Table 11.1(b).
If we sensibly disallow a negative number of scientists, any value of a
between 0 and 1/4 will be a possible answer to the question. For example,
a = 0 gives one extreme solution, shown in Table 11.1(c), in which there
are no left-handed crystallographers at all. The other extreme is given by
a = 1/4 (Table 11.1(d)), where all non-crystallographers are right-handed.
As neither of these is very likely, we need a sensible criterion to apply
to produce a plausible answer.
Let us see if it is sensible to seek a least-squares solution, i.e. ﬁnd the
value of a that minimizes the variance of the entries in Table 11.1(b). Such
a criterion will certainly avoid the extreme solutions we have already
looked at. The variance about the mean is given by:
V =


4
2
+
 1
12 −a
2
+ a2 +
1
6 + a
2
,
(11.2)
and the minimum of V occurs when dV/da = 0, giving a = 1/24. These
results are shown in Table 11.1(e). It appears from this that 1/8 of all
crystallographers are left-handed (1/3× 1/8 = 1/24), but we see that 5/16 of the
non-crystallographers are also left-handed (2/3 × 5/16 = 5/24). Why should
there be this difference? The original information did not indicate this,
and it seems we have made some hidden assumption that has caused it.
It actually arose because of the inappropriate technique used to obtain
the result; there is no good reason why all the probabilities should be as
close together as possible. What we really need is a method of obtaining
an unbiased estimate of the number of left-handed crystallographers.
Since crystallographers are not expected to be any different from other
scientists in this respect, it would be reasonable to suppose that 1/4 of
them are left-handed like the rest of the scientiﬁc population. In the
absence of any further information therefore, the most plausible result
should be that shown in Table 11.1(f) with a = 1/12.
Previously it was claimed that maximum entropy gave an unbiased
estimatefromincompletedata,i.e.itmadenohiddenassumptionsabout
missing information. Will the maximum-entropy solution therefore cor-
respond to our most plausible solution in Table 11.1(f)? The formula
for the entropy of the quantities in Table 11.1(b) will be derived later
[see (11.9)], but that does not stop us from using it here. Applying the

(11.3)
and the maximum occurs when dS/da = 0, giving a = 1/12. Maximum
entropy therefore does give the most plausible solution, already seen in
Table 11.1(f).
11.2.2
Forming images
Maximum entropy has clearly solved the problem in a most satisfying
way, but can it actually produce electron-density maps? Each array of
numbers in Table 11.1 could just as easily represent an electron density
map as probabilities of left-handedness among the scientiﬁc popula-
tion. However, the left-handed crystallographer problem was chosen to
illustrate the method because all the constraints are in the same space
as the number array. With an electron-density map, information about
the amplitudes is in reciprocal space. This is therefore at the wrong end
of a Fourier transform as far as the map is concerned, which introduces
complications in the mathematics. We have spared you this so you can
see more clearly how the method works.
11.2.3
Entropy and probability
Part of the deﬁnition of entropy is that the entropy of a complicated
system is the sum of the entropies of its separate parts. The state of order
of a system, which is measured by entropy, has a certain probability of
occurring. That is, for each value of entropy, there is a corresponding
value of probability. This may be written: S = f(P), where S is entropy,
P is probability and f is the function relating them.
Now,letusconsiderasystemoftwopartswithentropiesS1 andS2 and
corresponding probabilities P1 and P2. If these states are independent
of each other, the probability of the combined system is P1 × P2 while
its entropy is S1 + S2. That is, the entropy of the whole is
S = S1 + S2 = f(P1) + f(P2) = f(P1 × P2).
(11.4)
Compare this relationship with a fundamental property of loga-
rithms that
log(a) + log(b) = log(a × b).
(11.5)
It is clear from this that we can write for the entropy: S = log(P) and
ignore any constant factors that may multiply the log function.

11.3
Electron-density maps
153
11.3
Electron-density maps
If we could work out the probability of an electron-density map occur-
ring, this would immediately give a measure of its entropy. Let us
imagine building a two-dimensional map on a tray using grains of sand.
The tray is divided into small boxes corresponding to the grid points at
which the map is normally calculated, and the density is represented by
the number of sand grains piled up in each box. Throwing the sand onto
the tray at random will produce a map, though usually not a very good
one. However, the number of ways in which the grains of sand can be
arranged to produce the map is a measure of how likely it is to occur. If
there is only one way of arranging the sand to produce the map, it will
occur only very rarely with a random throw.

We now need to work out how many ways the sand can be arranged to
give a particular map. Figure 11.2 shows how a one-dimensional map
can be made from individual grains. Assume the sand consists of N
identical grains and that the map is built up by putting in place one
grain at a time. The ﬁrst grain has a choice of N places to go. The next
grain has N −1 choices, so the two together can be placed in the map
in N × (N −1) different ways. The third grain has N −2 places to go,
giving N × (N −1) × (N −2) combinations of positions for the three
grains. Thus, it can be seen that all N grains can be arranged in N! ways
altogether.

Fig. 11.3 Ways of arranging three objects in
a box.
Since the grains are identical, it does not matter how they are arranged
in each box in the tray; only the number of grains in the box affects
the shape of the map. If there are n1 grains in the ﬁrst box, they can
be arranged in n1! different ways within the box without affecting the
map. For example, Fig. 11.3 shows the 6 (=3!) possible arrangements of
3 grains. Therefore, the N! combinations for the map must be reduced
by this factor, leaving N!/n1! combinations. Each box can be treated in
this way, so the ﬁnal number of different combinations of position for
the grains of sand is:
N!
n1!n2! · · · nm!,
(11.6)
where there are m grid points in the map.
This will be proportional to the probability of occurrence of the map.
We can therefore obtain a measure of the entropy, S, by taking the log of
this expression:
S = log

N!
n1!n2! · · · nm!

.
(11.7)
This is greatly simpliﬁed by making use of Stirling’s approximation
to the factorial of large numbers:
log(N!) = N log(N) −N.
(11.8)

Treating all the factorials in this way and remembering that ni = N
leads to the formula for the entropy of the map:

where ρi is the density associated with the ith grid point and qi is the

density in the cell, but it can be updated as more information is obtained.

Least-squares ﬁtting of
parameters
Peter Main
In many scientiﬁc experiments, the experimental measurements are not
the actual quantities required. Nearly always, the values of interest must
be derived from those measured in the experiment. This is true in X-
ray crystallography, where the atomic parameters need to be obtained
from the X-ray intensities. It is this connection between parameters and
experimental measurements that will be examined here.
12.1
Weighted mean
We will start with a simple situation in which only a single parameter is
to be obtained, e.g. the length of a football pitch. A single measurement
will not be sufﬁcient, because it is easy to make mistakes, so we will
measure it several times and take an average. Let us assume the mea-
surements are: 86.5, 87.0, 86.1, 85.9, 86.2, 86.0, 86.4 m, giving an average
of 86.3 m. How reliable is this value? Is it really close to the true value or
is it just a good guess? An indication of its reliability or reproducibility
is obtained by calculating the variance about the mean:
σ 2 =
1
n −1
n

i=1
(xi −x)2,
(12.1)
where there are n measurements of value xi whose mean is x. For the
measurements of the football pitch, the variance σ 2 is 0.14 m2 and
the standard deviation, σ, is about 0.4 m. For measurements that fol-
low the Gaussian (normal) error distribution, there is a 68% chance
of the true value being within one standard deviation of the derived
value.
However, it may be possible to do better than this. We may know, for
example, that the ﬁrst two measurements were taken rather quickly and
are less reliable than the others. It is sensible therefore to rely more on
155

156
Least-squares ﬁtting of parameters
the good measurements by taking a weighted average:
x =
n
i=1 wixi
n
i=1 wi
,
(12.2)
where the weights wi are to be deﬁned. The weights used should be
those that give us the best value for the length of the pitch. However,
this depends upon how we deﬁne ‘best’. A very sensible deﬁnition, and
the one most often used, is to deﬁne ‘best’ as that value that minimizes
the variance. This leads directly to making the weights inversely pro-
portional to the variance of individual measurements, i.e. wi ∝1/σ 2
i
and, for independent measurements, the variance will now be
σ 2 =
n
n −1
n
i=1 wi(xi −x)2
n
i=1 wi
.
(12.3)
Minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations from the mean
gives the technique its title of ‘least squares’.
To apply this to the length of the pitch, we must decide on the relative
reliability of the measurements. Let us say we expect the error in the
ﬁrst two measurements to be about three times the error in the others.
Since the variance is the square of the expected error, the weights w1 and
w2 should be 1/9 of the other weights. Repeating the calculation using
these weights gives 86.2 m for the length of the pitch with an estimated
standard deviation of about 0.3 m. Notice that the estimated length has
changed and that the standard deviation is smaller.
12.2
Linear regression
Acommon example of the determination of two parameters is the ﬁtting
of a straight line through a set of experimental points. If the equation
of the line is y = mx + c, then the parameters are the slope, m, and
the intercept, c. The experimental measurements in this case are pairs
of values (xi, yi), which may represent, for example, the extension of a
spring, yi, due to the force xi. Lots of measurements can be taken and,
for each measurement, we can write down an observational equation
mxi+c = yi. This represents a system of linear simultaneous equations in
the unknown quantities m and c in that there are many more equations
than unknowns. There are no values of m and c that will satisfy the
equations exactly, so we seek values that satisfy the equations as well
as possible, i.e. give the ‘best’ straight line through the points on the
graph.
The residual of an observational equation is deﬁned as εi = yi−mxi−c.
Acommon deﬁnition of ‘best ﬁt’ is those values of m and c that minimize
ε2
i and this gives what statisticians call the line of linear regression.

12.2
Linear regression
157
The recipe for performing the calculation is as follows. Let us write the
observational equations in terms of matrices as
⎛

⎞
⎟⎟⎠
m


=
⎛
⎜⎜⎝

..
yn
⎞
⎟⎟⎠,
(12.4)
or, more concisely, as
Ax = b,
(12.5)
where, with a drastic change in notation, A is the left-hand-side matrix
containing the x values, x is the vector of unknowns m and c, and b is the
right-hand-side vector containing the y values. The matrix A is known
as the design matrix. The least-squares solution of these equations is
found by pre-multiplying both sides of (12.5) by the transpose of A
(ATA)x = ATb,
(12.6)
and solving the resulting equations for x. These are known as the normal
equations of least squares, which have the same number of equations as
unknowns. This is, in fact, a general recipe. The observational equations
(12.5) may consist of any number of equations and unknowns. Provided
there are more equations than unknowns, the least-squares solution is
obtained by solving the normal equations (12.6). The least-squares solu-
tion is deﬁned as that which minimizes the sum of the squares of the
residuals of the observational equations.
The observational equations can also be given weights. As in the cal-
culation of the weighted mean, the weights, wi, should be inversely
proportional to the (expected error)2 of each observational equation.
The error in the equation is taken as the residual, so the correct weights
are ∝1/(expected residual)2. To describe mathematically how the
weights enter into the calculation, we deﬁne a weight matrix, W. It
is a diagonal matrix with the weights as the diagonal elements and it
pre-multiplies both sides of the observational equations (12.5), i.e.
W A x = W b.
(12.7)
The normal equations of least squares are now
(AT W A)x = (AT W)b,
(12.8)
which are solved for the unknown parameters x. The weights ensure
that the equations that are thought to be more accurate are satisﬁed more
precisely. The quantity minimized is wiε2
i , where wi are the diagonal
elements of W.

12.2.1
Variances and covariances
Having obtained values for m and c, we now need to know how reliable
they are. That is, how do we calculate their variances? Also, since there
are two parameters, we need to know their covariance, i.e. how an error
in one affects the error in the other. This is important for the calculation
of any quantities derived from the parameters, such as bond lengths
calculated from atomic positions. If a quantity x is calculated from two
parameters a and b as
x = αa + βb,
(12.9)
then the variance of x is
σ 2
x = α2σ 2
a + β2σ 2
b + 2αβσaσbμab,
(12.10)
where σaσbμab is the covariance of a and b, and μab is the correlation
coefﬁcient. We can calculate both variances and covariances by deﬁning
a so-called variance–covariance matrix, M. It contains the variances as
diagonal elements and the covariances as off-diagonal elements. The
matrix M is obtained as

where (ATWA)−1 is the inverse of the normal matrix of least squares and
wε2/w is the weighted mean (residual)2. This is a general recipe for
the case where there are n observational equations with p parameters
to be derived. The quantity n −p is known as the number of degrees of
freedom in the equations. In the case of linear regression, p = 2. Notice
that, as p approaches the value of n, the variances increase. If n = p, i.e.
there are as many equations as unknowns, no estimate of variance can
be made using this recipe. To make the variances as small as possible,
there should be many more equations than unknowns, i.e. n ≫p. This
means that, in crystallographic least-squares reﬁnement, there should
be many more observed reﬂections than parameters in the structural
model.
12.2.2
Restraints
To illustrate some devices that are used in crystallographic least-squares
reﬁnement, let us see how inaccurate data can be treated in the following
situation. Imagine that a totally unskilled surveyor measures the angles
of a triangular ﬁeld and gets the results α = 73◦, β = 46◦, γ = 55◦.
He is so unskilled that he does not check to see if the angles add up
to 180◦until he gets back to the ofﬁce, and by then it is too late to
put things right. Can we do anything to help him? Obviously there

12.2
Linear regression
159
is no substitute for accurate measurements, but we can always try to
extract the maximum amount of information from the measurements
we have.
There is the additional information already alluded to, that the sum of
theanglesmustbe180◦.Thisinformationisnotusedinthemeasurement
of the angles and so should help to correct the measurements in some
way. If we included this as an additional equation and obtained a least-
squares solution, would we get a better result? The system of equations
will be:
α = 73◦
β = 46◦
γ = 55◦
α + β + γ = 180◦,
(12.12)
and the least-squares solution is α = 74.5◦, β = 47.5◦, γ = 56.5◦. The
effect of using the additional information is to change the sum of the
angles from its original value of 174◦to a more acceptable 178.5◦. This
is called a restraint on the angles. Restraints are commonly used in
least-squares reﬁnement of crystal structures, such as when a group of
atoms is known to be approximately planar or a particular interatomic
distance is well known. Such information is included as additional
observational equations. Notice that all the equations in (12.12) have
the same residual of 1.5◦when the least-squares solution is substituted
into them.
We may be able to help our hapless surveyor even more. Upon
quizzing him, it emerges that the expected error in α is probably half
that of the other measurements. This allows us to apply weights to the
observational equations that are inversely proportional to the variance.
The restraint did not seem to be applied strongly enough either. Perhaps
we would like the sum of angles to be closer to 180◦than it turned out to
be, so let us include the restraint with a larger weight also. The weighted
observational equations now look like this:
⎛

(12.13)
where the weight and design matrices have been written out separately.
This time the least-squares solution gives α = 73.6◦, β = 48.4◦, γ =
57.4◦. It is seen that the sum of the angles is closer to 180◦than before,
namely 179.4◦, and α has moved away less from its measured value than
the other angles, reﬂecting its greater presumed accuracy.

160
Least-squares ﬁtting of parameters
However, this result deserves further comment. It was stated that the
expected error in α is half that of the other angles, yet its shift in value
is only one quarter of the shifts applied to β and γ . Why is this? The
answer lies in an unjustiﬁed assumption that was made when setting
up the weight matrix. The diagonal elements are all correctly calculated
as inversely proportional to the variance of the corresponding equation,
but the equations were all assumed to be independent of each other,
making the weight matrix diagonal. The equations are certainly not
independent, since the error in α in the top equation will also appear in
an identical fashion in the bottom equation. Errors in β and γ appear
similarly. This is correctly dealt with by taking into account the covari-
ances of the equations, giving rise to off-diagonal elements in the weight
matrix. In crystallographic least squares this is always ignored, so it will
be ignored here also.
12.2.3
Constraints
What we should have done from the very beginning is to insist that the
sum of the angles is exactly 180◦, which of course it is. Instead of using
it as a restraint, which is only partially satisﬁed, we will now use it as a
constraint, which must be satisﬁed exactly.
There are two standard ways of applying constraints and by far the
most elegant is the following. If the equations we wish to solve are
expressed as
Ax = b,
(12.14)
and the variables x are subject to several linear constraints, then we can
express the constraints as the equations
G x = f.
(12.15)
In our example, the equations (12.14) are α = 73◦, β = 46◦, γ = 55◦
and there is only one constraint, given by the equation α +β +γ = 180◦.
In the more general case, the solution of (12.14) subject to the constraints
(12.15) is given by

A
GT
G
0
 x
λ

=
b
f

,
(12.16)
where the left-hand-side matrix consists of four smaller matrices as
shown, and a vector of new variables λ has been introduced. There
is one new variable for each constraint. The technical name for these
additional variables is Lagrange multipliers. These equations are now
solved for x and λ. Normally, the values of the λs are not required, so
they can be ignored, and the xs are now the solution of (12.14) subject
to the constraints (12.15).

12.2
Linear regression
161
Let us try this on the simple example of the angles in a triangle, but this
time apply the sum of the angles as a constraint. Since this is no longer
a least-squares calculation (there are the same number of equations as
unknowns) the square root of the previous weights must be applied,
giving the equations
2α + λ = 146◦
β + λ = 46◦
γ + λ = 55◦
α + β + γ = 180◦
(12.17)
The four equations are solved for α, β, γ and λ to give α = 74.2◦,
β = 48.4◦, γ = 57.4◦and λ = −2.4◦. It can be seen that the constraint is
satisﬁed exactly and that the shift in the value of α is half the shifts in β
and γ , as you would expect.
If there are more equations than unknowns, as is normally the case,
the equations (12.16) become


GT

 x




ATWb
f

,
(12.18)
where a weight matrix has also been included. You may recognize in
(12.18) the normal equations of least squares along with the constraint
equations.
There are more equations in (12.17) than parameters we wish to evalu-
ate. This is always the case when constraints are applied using Lagrange
multipliers. In crystallographic least-squares reﬁnement, the number of
parameters is usually large (it can easily be several thousand) and any
increase in the size of the matrix by the application of constraints is
avoided if possible. Normally, crystallographers use a different method
of applying constraints – one that will actually decrease the size of the
matrix.
In this method, the constraint equations are used to give relationships
among the unknowns so that some of them can be expressed in terms
of others. In general, the constraint equations may be expressed as
x = Cy + d,
(12.19)
where x is the original vector of unknowns and y is a new set
of unknowns, reduced in number by the number of independent
constraints. Substituting this into (12.14) gives
ACy = b −Ad,
(12.20)
from which a least-squares solution for y is obtained. Since there are
fewer unknowns represented by the y vector than those in x, this is a

162
Least-squares ﬁtting of parameters
smaller system of equations than we had before. The original variables
x are then obtained from (12.19).
To illustrate this using the angles of a triangle, we can express γ in
terms of α and β by the constraint γ = 180 −α −β. We will call the
reduced set of unknowns u and v such that
⎛

(12.23)
which give u = 75, v = 48, so that α = 75, β = 48 and γ = 57. No
weights were used in this illustration, so all angles are shifted by the
same amount and their sum is exactly 180◦.
12.3
Non-linear least squares
At this point we discover that someone else in the surveyor’s ofﬁce has
also measured the ﬁeld, except he obtained the lengths of the three sides.
These are a = 21 m, b = 16 m, c = 19 m. We can now do even better than
before, because additional information is at hand. The sides are related
to the angles using the sine rule. That is:
a
sin α =
b
sin β =
c
sin γ ,
(12.24)
which gives additional equations that can be added to our set. The difﬁ-
culty is that the new equations are non-linear and, in general, there is no
direct way of solving them to obtain values of the parameters. However,
we need to be able to deal with these as well, since the equations for the
reﬁnement of crystal structures are also non-linear.
Let us use the new equations ﬁrst of all as restraints. That is, they are
simply added to the observational equations with appropriate weights.

12.3
Non-linear least squares
163
Our unweighted observational equations could now be:
2α = 146◦
β = 46◦
γ = 55◦
a = 21 m
b = 16 m
c = 19 m
a sin β −b sin α = 0m
b sin γ −c sin β = 0m
α + β + γ = 180◦,
(12.25)
i.e. nine equations in six unknowns. However, four of the equations
give the value of an angle, while the remaining ﬁve give a length.
How can you compare length measurements with angle measurements?
Does it matter whether you express the angles in terms of degrees or
radians? This can all be taken care of in the weights assigned to the
equations. A proper weighting scheme will make the expected variance
of each weighted equation numerically the same and make sure that
the expected errors in the parameters all have the same effect upon the
equations. However, it is unnecessary to go into such details here. The
same problem arises in the reﬁnement of crystal structures where, for
example, atomic displacement parameters are determined along with
atomic positional parameters. Surprisingly, not every crystallographic
least-squares program does this properly.
Using the current values of the sides and angles of the triangle will
not satisfy the last three equations in (12.25). Our aim is to minimize
the sum of the squares of the residuals of all the equations by adjusting
the values of a, b, c, α, β, γ , thus giving the least-squares solution. Now
let us see how this least-squares solution may be obtained. Let the ith
non-linear equation be fi(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 0 whose jth parameter is xj.
The derivative of fi with respect to xj is ∂fi/∂xj. We can set up a matrix,
A, of such derivatives so the element aij is ∂fi/∂xj. There will be as many
rows in the matrix as observational equations and as many columns as
parameters. We can also calculate the residual, εi, of each equation using
the current parameter values. The shifts x to the parameters can then
be calculated from the equations Ax = −ε, where ε is the vector of
residuals. When there are more equations than unknowns, least-squares
values are obtained by solving
(ATA)x = −ATε.
(12.26)
The shifts to the parameters are then applied to give new values
xnew = xold + x,
(12.27)

164
Least-squares ﬁtting of parameters
which should satisfy the observational equations better than the old
values.
However, this recipe is strictly valid only for inﬁnitesimally small
shifts and is an approximation for parameter shifts of realistic size. This
means the new parameter values are still only approximate and further
shifts need to be calculated. A process of iteration is therefore set up, in
which the latest parameter values are used to obtain new shifts and the
operation is repeated until the calculated shifts are negligible.
Applying the recipe to the triangle example gives the matrix of
derivatives

which is used to set up the equations for the parameter shifts.
Note that, in order to apply this method of ﬁtting the parameters to
the experimental measurements, we need to begin with approximate
values that are then adjusted to improve the ﬁt with the experimental
data. There is generally no way of determining these values directly
from the non-linear equations.
12.4
Ill-conditioning
You are probably very familiar with the general rule that if anything can
go wrong, it will. There are many traps for the unwary in least-squares
reﬁnement, but one that everyone must know about is ill-conditioning.
Consider the innocent-looking pair of equations:
23.3x + 37.7y = 14.4
8.9x + 14.4y = 5.5.
(12.29)
The exact solution is easily conﬁrmed to be x = −1, y = 1. However,
in the equations we normally deal with, the coefﬁcients are subject to
error – either experimental errors or errors in the model. Let us simulate
a very small error in (12.29) by changing the right-hand side of the ﬁrst
equation from 14.4 to 14.39. Solving the equations this time yields the
result x = 13.4, y = −7.9. The equations are, in fact, ill-conditioned and a
very small change in the right-hand side has made the solution unrecog-
nisably different. The computer will also introduce its own errors into
the calculation, because it works to a limited precision. How can we

12.5
Computing time
165
trust the solution of a system of equations ever again? We clearly need
to recognize ill-conditioning when we see it.
Acommon way of recognizing an ill-conditioned system of equations
is to calculate the determinant of the left-hand-side matrix. In this case
it is −0.01. An ill-conditioned matrix always has a determinant whose
value is small compared with the general size of its elements. Another,
related, symptom is that the inverse matrix has very large elements. In
this case, the inverse is
−1440
3770
890
−2330

.
(12.30)
Since the inverse matrix features in the formula (12.9) for calculat-
ing the variance–covariance matrix, an ill-conditioned normal matrix of
least squares automatically leads to very large variances for the derived
parameters.
In an extreme case, the determinant of the left-hand-side matrix may
be zero. The matrix is then said to be singular and the equations no
longer have a unique solution. They may have an inﬁnite number of
solutions or no solution at all. Physically, this means the equations do
not contain the information required to evaluate the parameters. If the
information is not there, there is no way of getting it from the equations.
To make progress, it is necessary either to remove the parameters that
are not deﬁned by the observations, or to add new equations to the
system so that all the parameters are deﬁned. There are a number of
ways of producing a singular matrix in crystallographic least-squares
reﬁnement. Easy ways are to reﬁne parameters that should be ﬁxed by
symmetry, or to reﬁne all atomic positional parameters in a polar space
group: the symmetry does not deﬁne the origin along the polar axis, so
the atomic positions in this direction can have only relative values.
12.5
Computing time
Most computing time in X-ray crystallography is spent on the least-
squares reﬁnement of the crystal structure. An appreciation of where
this time goes may help crystallographers use their computing resources
more efﬁciently.

which contain the atomic positional parameters for N atoms, and will
usually also contain the atomic displacement parameters in addition to
occupancy factors, scale factors etc. There will be as many equations as

166
Least-squares ﬁtting of parameters
observed structure factors; let this be n, with p parameters describing the
structure. If the calculation proceeds by setting up the normal equations
of least squares, this will be the most time-consuming part of the whole
process. The matrix multiplication alone (to form ATA) will require
about np2/2 multiplication operations. With p equal to a few hundred
and n equal to a few thousand, np2/2 will typically be a few tens of
millions (∼107). Efﬁcient computer algorithms can reduce this to a few
times np operations, i.e. of the order of 106, but it is still large.
The amount of work required to solve the normal equations is about
p3/3 multiplications, while it takes about p3 multiplications to invert
the matrix. Note that it is unnecessary to invert the matrix to solve the
equations and so the matrix inverse should only be calculated when it is
needed for the estimation of variances. Again, computer times may be
reduced by using efﬁcient algorithms, but matrix inversion will always
take a lot less time than that required to set up the normal equations.

Reﬁnement of crystal

David Watkin
This chapter is intended to supplement the introduction to the theory
of least squares given in Chapter 12, and provide crystallographic illus-
trations. Fourier methods (Chapter 8) provide a crucial reﬁnement tool,
especially if trial stuctures remain intransigent.
If direct methods are a black box, then reﬁnement is a black art. There
is no recipe book to deal with all situations. Difﬁcult reﬁnements, that
is, ones where the R-factor does not fall as expected, or the results look
anomalous, can be dealt with only by inventing strategies and trying
them. An understanding of the background mathematics and physics,
together with a knowledge of the literature, may enable you to use the
tools provided in your software to overcome the problem.
There is a massive literature, but some selected references are

Bragg’s law
4 sin2 θ/λ2 = h2a∗2 . . . + 2klb∗c∗cos α∗.
(13.1)
Bragg’s law in three dimensions. This tells us that the positions of the
diffraction data in reciprocal space depend only upon the dimensions
and symmetry of the unit cell. If the sample contains domains sufﬁ-
ciently large to cause diffraction, but randomly orientated with respect
to each other, the sample is a polycrystalline powder, and the diffrac-
tion pattern will consist of randomly overlaid reciprocal lattices giving
diffraction ‘rings’. If the domains have simple geometric relationships
between then, the sample is a twin or polytwin, and will give interpen-
etrating but related diffraction patterns for each component. There is
generally systematic overlapping of the lattice points. If adjacent unit
cells differ slightly, but the difference is periodic, the sample is modu-
lated. Correct interpretation of the reciprocal lattice is a pre-requisite for
all analyses.

(13.2)
The intensity and phase of each ‘reﬂection’ in a diffraction pattern
depend upon the interaction of the incident wavefront with the con-
tinuous periodic electron density throughout a mosaic block. A mosaic
block is a fragment of crystal in which the alignment of the constituent
unit cells is sufﬁciently accurate to enable interference to occur. Because
diffraction is an interference phenomenon, the resulting diffracted
beams have both an amplitude and a phase. Beams diffracted from adja-
centmosaicblocks(ortwindomains)havenorationalphaserelationship
between them, so that the resulting intensity is just the sum of the con-
stituent intensities. In general, the intensities can be easily measured
but not the phases; their measurement requires interferometry exper-
iments. Every point in the continuous electron density contributes to
each diffracted beam (Fig. 13.1).

If the intensity and phase of all the diffracted beams could be measured,

The continuous electron density in a unit cell can be replaced by a
parameterized model, that provides a convenient approximate repre-
sentation of the true electron density. It is this model which is normally
called the ‘crystal structure’. Remember that X-rays do not see atoms –
they see average electron density. We replace this by discrete atoms as
a convenience.
13.2
Reasons for performing reﬁnement
Reﬁnement usually means adjustment of the values in the param-
eterized model according to some criteria. Both Fourier and least-
squares methods are regularly applied in crystallography. Reﬁnement
is undertaken for a number of reasons, as follows.
13.2.1
To improve phasing so that computed electron
density maps more closely represent the actual
electron density
Commonly used variations of (13.3) are as follows.
F = Fo, α = αc. The resultant map contains features from both the
observed intensities and the computed phases. It is easily demonstrated
that the phases have a profound inﬂuence on the features in the map,
so that their veracity is fundamental. Better phases lead to better maps,
which in their turn can lead to better phases, and so on.
F = Fo −Fc, α = αc. The ‘difference map’. If the structure amplitudes
generated from the model lead to Fc values differing only from the
observed amplitudes by their random errors, then this map will be fea-
tureless. This criterion is normally assumed to indicate that the structure
has been properly parameterized, and it is assumed that, if Fc is the
same as Fo, then αc will be the same as the (unmeasured) αo. The prob-
lem is that there are unspeciﬁed (and possibly systematic) errors in Fo.
The Fourier transform of the residual Fo −Fc and αc may contain fea-
tures that will enable the model to be improved. Isolated positive peaks
indicate atoms missing from the model. Positive peaks adjacent to neg-
ative peaks indicate misplaced atoms, and positive or negative peaks
surrounded by ripples indicate either inappropriate atomic scattering
factors or inappropriate isotropic displacement parameters. Pairs of pos-
itive and negative peaks forming a ‘clover leaf’ indicate inappropriate
anisotropic displacement parameters.
F = 2Fo −Fc or F = 3Fo −2Fc, α = αc. Hybrid maps having proper-
ties in common with both the normal Fo map and a difference map. They
reveal features from the current model, and as-yet unparameterized

features, and are commonly used in macromolecular crystallography. If
the data are subject to a θ cut-off before the majority of the reﬂections
are unobservably weak, the map will show series termination ripples
with a wavelength slightly less than the resolution limit.
F = xFo.(1 −x)E, α = αc. E is the normalized structure amplitude, as
used in direct methods, so that the peaks appearing in the map are
accentuated. The optimal value for x is resolution dependent.
The phases, αc, are generally obtained from the current parameter-
ized model, which may itself have been reﬁned by either Fourier or
least-squares methods. Rarely, the computed phase may contain a con-
tribution from the discrete Fourier transform of part of an existing map
(SQUEEZE in PLATON; Spek, 2003). Interpretation of maps is the most
common way of locating items missing from the parameterized model,
though other forms of model building may also be applicable (addition
of hydrogen atoms at their expected positions, geometric completion of
other regular shapes, e.g. PF−
6 groups).
13.2.2
To try to verify that the structure is ‘correct’
Because there is no way of directly and unambiguously computing the
structure from the data, there is always the possibility that the proposed
structure is ‘wrong’. There are broadly two ways of assessing the validity
of a structure.
1. From the X-ray data alone. This is the most fundamental method,
and is the only one applicable to totally novel materials. It is also
the most difﬁcult method to apply. Techniques for parameter opti-
mization that rely on ﬁtting Fc to Fo cannot be certain that there
is not another solution giving about the same goodness of ﬁt for
the amplitudes, but a better ﬁt for the (unmeasured) phases. In
addition, in reality we know little about the actual errors in the
observed data, and there is the risk that over-parameterization of
the model will simply result in a model that better ﬁts the uniden-
tiﬁed errors. In protein crystallography, where there is a very real
possibility that a structure will be novel (in that there are still no
reliable ways for predicting protein folding), Rfree is used to mon-
itor parameterization. A random subset of the data, often 10%, is
excluded from the parameterization stage of the reﬁnement, but
has its value calculated whenever there is a substantial change in
the modelling. If Rfree fails to fall by a signiﬁcant amount, it is prob-
able that the change in the modelling is following noise in the data
(the signal represents a common trend throughout all the data, the
noise is individual to each data point, though systematic errors
can be regarded as correlated noise). Rfree is rarely used in small-
molecule work since 10% of a typical data set does not contain
enough reﬂections to give a reliable estimator.
2. From comparisons with the ‘known’ properties of structures. This
is a Bayesian method, but requires that the analyst correctly

174
Reﬁnement of crystal structures
identify which properties are known, and what their values are.
It cannot reveal if a structure is ‘right’, but may reveal that it is
‘wrong’.
‘Wrongness’ comes in several forms.
(a) Correct local geometry, but the whole structure is misplaced
in the cell. This phenomenon was common with early direct
methods programs, and may also occur for structures solved
by Patterson methods when the ‘heavy’ atom is not all that
heavy. Symptoms include the following.
i. The structure looks generally OK, but gives a high R factor,
often as low as 20%, but failing to fall any lower.
ii. Unusual bond lengths and adps. These rarely fall into a
systematic pattern, as might be the case for reﬁnement in a
space group of too-low symmetry.
iii. Unreasonable intermolecular contacts. Translational mis-
placement of a structure within a cell will generally bring
it too close to a symmetry element, leading to very short
non-bonded contacts.
iv. Noisy difference maps. The difference map may be gener-
ally noisy, show some inexplicable peaks, or occasionally
show ghost structural fragments.
v. Strongly featured DIFABS map1 or highly anisotropic R-

ordinates in reciprocal space to the ratio
of Fo:Fc. The value of this function can be
plotted out to reveal if this ratio deviates

errors in the data, e.g. absorption, crystal decay, crystal mis-
centring, icing, beam inhomogeneity.
(b) Incorrect but plausible local geometry. This is relatively rare in
small-molecule crystallography. The most common occurrence
is generally due to disorder. Symptoms are as follows.
i. R factor higher than anticipated, though often as decep-
tively low as 6–8%.
ii. Novel molecular features. These must sometimes occur,
otherwise there is little point in much structure analysis.
However, if they cannot be rationalized by accepted chem-
ical or physical reasoning, there remains the possibility that
the structure is false.
iii. Weird adps. Weird may mean unexpectedly large, small or
anisotropic. Usually, if something is simply ‘wrong’, there
is no evident relationship between the adps of adjacent
atoms.
iv. A few particularly large Fo −Fc discrepancies, though the
most common cause for this is some kind of failure in the
data collection or pre-processing.
v. Noisy difference maps. The maps are generally rather fea-
tureless except for a few substantial peaks, though cases are
known where the maps were quite featureless even though
subsequent events showed that the proposed structure was
in serious error.

13.3
Data quality and limitations
175
13.2.3
To obtain the ‘best’ values for the
parameters in the model
Once the analyst is convinced that the structure is essentially correct,
weighted least-squares reﬁnement is used to optimize the parameter
values.
13.3
Data quality and limitations
The quality of the data should be as high as is economically practical.
Spending a little time choosing a good crystal from a mixed batch is time
well spent, though it also harbours the risk that the chosen crystal is not
truly representative. Spending very long times on data collection is use-
ful only if the crystal is of excellent quality, since the signal-to-noise ratio
only doubles if the counting time is increased by a factor of 4. Factors
arising in data collection that can affect later reﬁnement are as follows.
13.3.1
Resolution
With copper radiation and organic molecules, useful data can usually
be measured to the instrument θ limit. With molybdenum radiation,
the operator needs to use experience. If there are a few heavy ele-
ments present, they will dominate the high-angle data, and they should
be measured to reduce series termination (diffraction ripple) effects.
If there are only light atoms, the mean (Wilson) temperature factor B
will show when reﬂections become indistinguishable from background.

176
Reﬁnement of crystal structures
Lack of properly measured high-angle data will restrict the quality
of the analysis. However, if the Wilson temperature factor is unusu-
ally high, this indicates that the crystal itself is of poor quality, with
substantial static or dynamic disorder. Re-collection of the data at a
lower temperature should reduce dynamic disorder. Unless there is
a phase change with conservation of crystallinity, struggling to work
at extremely low temperatures rarely has much inﬂuence on this
type of problem. The best strategy is either to try to understand the
nature of the disorder, or to try growing better crystals by a different
method. Simply including high-angle refections that are indistinguish-
able from noise into a reﬁnement in order to achieve some required
observation-to-parameter ratio is neither productive nor desirable.
13.3.2
Completeness
All kinds of reﬁnement are to some extent sensitive to the systematic
omission of substantial sections of the reciprocal lattice. Fourier meth-
ods, depending upon a summation over the whole reciprocal lattice, are
most sensitive to missing reﬂections. Least-squares methods are more
robust. Loss of data in the ‘cusp’ region of some diffractometers is rarely
important. More serious is not collecting data to similar resolution in all
directions in the asymmetric unit of reciprocal space.
13.3.3
Leverage
While all the reﬂections should be used to compute the electron density
at any point in the unit cell, in least-squares reﬁnement some reﬂec-
tions will have a particular inﬂuence on certain parameters. This effect is
known as leverage. Once a structure has been approximately solved, it is
possible to determine which reﬂections are important for which param-
eters. These reﬂections can be carefully remeasured and introduced into
the reﬁnement with appropriate weights or used as discriminators to
test the effectiveness of new parameterizations.
13.3.4
Weak reﬂections and systematic absences
As noted above, high-angle weak reﬂections have very little information
content. Weak lower-angle reﬂections can be really important, for exam-
ple in deciding between a centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric
space group. The problem is to get systematic-error-free determinations
of these reﬂections. Programs that perform analysis of the systematic
absences generally reveal that, within a given θ range, these reﬂections
have a net positive value, i.e. are not strictly absent. Reasons for this
include the Renninger effect, thermal diffuse scattering, λ/2 contamina-
tion and deviations from strict space group symmetry. These net positive
values for absences suggest that all weak low-angle reﬂections may be
systematically in error, a condition that cannot be properly handled by
least-squares reﬁnement.

13.4
Reﬁnement fundamentals
177
13.3.5
Standard uncertainties
Even when most data were collected on serial diffractometers there were
differences of opinion about the correct way to compute the standard
uncertainties, particularly of the very strong and very weak reﬂections.
With the advent of area detectors, with their very sophisticated numer-
ical data pre-processing, the uncertainty in the uncertainty has grown.
Even the massive redundancy possible with these machines creates a
false sense of security (remember the parable of the Emperor of China’s
new robes3). If the errors in the individual observations are large but
3Discussedinanarticle‘Howprecisearemea-
surements of unit-cell dimensions from single
crystals?’ (Herbstein, 2000).
more or less randomly distributed about the ‘true’ value, then repeated
measurements will yield a result approaching the true result (central
limit theorem). In this case, even if Rint is large, the structure can be well
reﬁned to a reasonably trustworthy solution. If the individual observa-
tions are highly reproducible, but systematically wrong, this will lead
to a low Rint, but an incorrect ﬁnal structure.
13.3.6
Systematic trends
One might expect that, for a given instrument, all structures of a similar
constitution would reﬁne to about the same R value, and this is often
the case. In those cases where the R value is anomalously low, we might
suspect that the R factor is dominated by an anomalous feature in the
structure, such as the presence of heavy atoms. In those cases where
it is anomalously high, the analyst should seek an explanation. The
following are possible explanations.
i. Weak data, i.e. the intensities disappear into the background at a
relatively low θ angle. This can be due to static or dynamic disorder,
poor crystallinity, or large solvent content.
ii. Features in the data that cannot be represented by the normal struc-
tural model. Either the experiment should be repeated, taking care
to avoid these unwanted trends in the data, or some kind of ‘cor-
rection’ should be applied to the data to remove them. Statistically,
this kind of tampering with the data is not recommended, and the
statistician would prefer the model to be extended to reﬂect these
perturbations in the data. In practice, it turns out that the tinker-
ing works reasonably well (e.g. empirical absorption corrections,
SADABS-, DIFABS- and SORTAV-like procedures).
13.4
Reﬁnement fundamentals
For the bulk of small-molecule structures, reﬁnement means some
process related to least squares. The process seeks to minimize some
function

w(Y1 −Y2)2.
(13.5)

178
Reﬁnement of crystal structures
13.4.1
w, the weight
For a statistically well-understood problem, it can be shown that, for
uncorrelated errors in the observations, the optimal parameter values
and their standard uncertainties are obtained when the weight is equal
to the inverse of the variance of the observation. In crystallography,
we are by no means certain about the distribution of the errors in our
observations, nor can we be certain that our model is capable of fully
explaining the observations; for example, there may be systematic errors
in the data that should be accounted for by additional parameters in the
model. Weights are now usually chosen to satisfy the criterion that there
is no appreciable trend in M for any rational ranking of the data. This
enables the weights to reﬂect errors in both the data and the model, and
leads to optimal parameter values and s.u.s for that model. Computing
these model-dependent weights when the model is substantially incor-
rect may lead to the error being concealed. It is therefore recommended
that purely statistical or modiﬁed unit weights be used in the early
stages. Note that unit weights are robust for Fo reﬁnement, and should
be replaced by (1/2F) or 1/σ 2(F2
o) for F2
o reﬁnement. Note also that the
assumption that the errors in observations are uncorrelated is generally
unfounded, though no widely available single-crystal programs use the
full data variance-covariance matrix.
Omission of data according to some s.u. threshold is a brutal way of
down-weighting (to zero!) the weak reﬂections, and in principle can-
not be justiﬁed. However, there is little justiﬁcation either in including
hundreds of high-angle data that are indistinguishable from noise. An
appropriate θ cut-off is more acceptable than an I/σ(I) cut-off. The small
numbers of weak reﬂections remaining in the reﬁnement, even if posi-
tively biased as explained above, probably do little harm, and may even
be required for some kinds of analysis.
Weighting schemes can be modiﬁed in various ways to accelerate
convergence, to reduce the inﬂuence of outliers, or to enhance some
feature of the structure.
13.4.2
Y1, the observations
The community is still divided as to whether Y1 should be Fo, F2
o or I. The
debate is ﬁnely balanced, and in practice perfectly acceptable results are
obtained whichever representation is used. Traditional nomenclature,
in which the structure factor is written |Fo|, has added to the confusion.
The moduli signs were introduced to remind the reader that one can
measure only the magnitude of the diffracted beam but not the phase. It
has nothing to do with taking the square root of F2. Negative F values are
permitted in least-squares reﬁnement. The application of a non-linear
transformation (taking the square root) to the data raises several issues.
Rollett and Prince have independently shown that, with appropri-
ate weighting, both F and F2 reﬁnements yield the same parameters
and s.u.s.

13.4
Reﬁnement fundamentals
179
Non-linear transformations of the data lead to a skewing of the error
distribution. For medium and strong reﬂections, a 1/2F term success-
fully accommodates this, but there is an evident problem if F is ≤0.
In the absence of a proper knowledge of the error distribution in F2
for weak reﬂections, an approximate value has to be estimated for the
s.u. of Fo.
Why was reﬁnement against Fo ever introduced? Transformation of
data or variables is a technique commonly used to improve the numer-
ical stability of a calculation, which would certainly have been an issue
before digital computers. In the case of transformation from F2 to F,
except for very small reﬂections, unit weights are close to the optimal
weighting, again an advantage before computers. Neither of these con-
siderations is important now for routine work, though F reﬁnement
remains resistant to the effects of outliers (especially partially occluded
observations), particularly among the strong reﬂections.
Although the minima for both reﬁnements should be the same, the
pathsfromagivenstartingmodelwillbedifferent.Therearesuggestions
that F2 reﬁnement is less inﬂuenced by false minima, but I have only
seen contrived artiﬁcial examples of this.
Contrary to common belief, for the software user F2 reﬁnement has no
advantage over Fo reﬁnement for either determining the Flack parame-
ter, or treating twinned data. The programmer has a little more work to
do in the case of Fo reﬁnement.
Note that the F versus F2 debate is quite independent of the debate
about the inclusion/exclusion of weak reﬂections.
13.4.3
Y2, the calculations
This is generally Fc or F2
c to match Y1. In maximum-likelihood reﬁne-
ment, the following function is minimized:
M =

(Fo −⟨Fo⟩)2.
(13.6)
⟨Fo⟩is the expected value of Fo, and is a modiﬁed form of Fc. It is
intended to include a contribution to the minimization function due to
the uncertainty in the phase angle, and seems to be particularly useful
in protein crystallography, where the models rarely achieve the same
resolution as those for small molecules. As the model improves, ⟨Fo⟩
approaches Fc, and such is the power of modern direct methods pro-
grams that it is generally believed that initial structures are so good
that maximum-likelihood methods have little to offer small-molecule
crystallographers.1/σML isaspecialweightingfunction.Maximumlike-
lihood may have some role in cases of pseudo-centred cells, where a very
large percentage of the data is systematically weak. Edwards (1992) has
shown that maximum-likelihood least squares is unaffected by the F2
to F transformation.

Issues
During least-squares reﬁnement, (13.7) is solved. There are some
important things to notice.
i. The observations of restraint are handled in the same way as the
X-ray observations.
ii. The matrix of constraint is applied to the whole matrix of deriva-
tives, so will override any conﬂicting restraints.
iii. The shift-limiting restraints are included as equations in the matrix
work – they inﬂuence the terms in the matrix, and hence its
numerical processing.

iv. The matrix of partial shifts is applied after the matrix inversion,
and so cannot help in the control of singularities.
v. The terms in the design matrix do not involve the values of the
observations, only terms computed from the current model. If the
model is seriously wrong, these terms will also be seriously wrong.
vi. The vector of residuals involves both the actual observations and
values calculated from the model. If the values of Fc are hopelessly
wrong, these residuals will drive the reﬁnement towards a false
minimum.
13.5
Reﬁnement strategies
If there were a known, single, reproducible reﬁnement strategy, it would
have been programmed long ago. In the 1970s it was hoped that such a
strategy was on the point of being discovered. Now, 30 years later, com-
puterized strategies do exist for the processing of good-quality data
from well-behaved structures, but there is an ever-growing number
of structures requiring some kind of human insight and intervention.
If a structure does not develop and reﬁne in the normal way, some

13.5
Reﬁnement strategies
181
possible actions are listed below. A reﬁnement ‘blows up’ when the
R factor begins to rise uncontrollably, or the displacement parameters
take on nonsensical values, or massive parameter shifts make the struc-
ture unrecognizable. At later stages, it can also mean that the extinction
parameter or some displacement parameters have gone substantially
negative.
The crucial thing to remember about reﬁnement is that both Fourier
and least-squares methods have limited ranges of convergence. Both
(13.3) and (13.7) involve the current model. The better the current model,
the greater the chance of computing reliable estimates of changes to
make to the parameters. In difﬁcult cases, model development should
be undertaken cautiously, with non-crystallographic information used
to hold parameters at sensible values. Many cases are known where the
structure solution was difﬁcult, yet for which the ﬁnal fully parame-
terized model reﬁned quite stably. Exclusion of valid atoms is generally
less harmful than inclusion of false ones, and in any case the valid atoms
generally reappear in subsequent maps.
i. If the direct methods solution does not appear to reveal the struc-
ture, try changing some of the initial parameters, or try changing
program. If SIRxx initially shows a promising structure, which falls
to pieces during the automatic reﬁnement, turn off the reﬁnement
and process the initial solution manually. Note that very poor data
or data with systematic errors can yield an interpretable E-map that
may never reﬁne well.
ii. If the direct methods give a reasonable ﬁgure of merit but the
structure looks wrong, try alternative programs for assembling
molecules. Molecule assembly routines are affected in different
ways by missing or spurious peaks. If this fails, compute a pack-
ing diagram and set the bonding criteria to a little more than their
usual values. Packing diagrams are especially useful if the molecule
straddles symmetry elements. A chemist, knowing what to look
for, may spot molecular fragments amongst a jumble of spurious
peaks.
iii. If the structure is plausible overall, but ‘blows up’ on normal reﬁne-
ment, try Fourier reﬁnement. For Fourier reﬁnement it is best to
omit really dubious atoms from the model used to compute phases.
iv. If the main features are recognizable, use geometric model build-
ing to regularize the molecular parameter values (bonds, angles,
planarity).
v. Least squares can be used to identify potentially spurious atoms.
A few cycles of reﬁnement of Uiso (with ﬁxed x, y, z) may reveal
spurious atoms as those with very high values.
vi. Least squares has no mechanism for introducing new atoms. This
can be done only by Fourier methods or model building. 2Fo −Fc
or 3Fo−2Fc maps are often the easiest to interpret.
vii. If the model persists in blowing up, try increasing the effect of
shift-limiting restraints. Fix the isotropic displacement parameters

182
Reﬁnement of crystal structures
at something a little below the Wilson prediction, and reﬁne only
the positions.
13.6
Under- and over-parameterization4
4Protein crystallographers often call over-
parameterization ‘over-ﬁtting’ or ‘over-
reﬁnement’.
There is no a priori reason for believing that a given data set will ade-
quately deﬁne any particular crystallographic parameter, though there
are general trends. Set the worst-behaved parameters to reasonable
values while you sort out the well-behaved ones.
Most well-behaved parameters are higher up this list:
i. unit cell
ii. space group
iii. atom positions
iv. Uiso
v. Uaniso
vi. extinction
vii. Flack parameter
viii. hydrogen atom parameters
ix. static disorder
x. mixed site occupancy
with the least-well behaved towards the bottom.
13.6.1
Under-parameterization
If important features are omitted from the model, then the remain-
ing parameters will reﬁne to values that try to compensate for these
omissions.
The following are some examples.
i. The simplest form of under-parameterization is the omission of
hydrogen atoms from organic structures. Individually they have
only a small local effect, but if they are numerous, they can have
a noticeable effect on the low-angle reﬂections, and hence on the
scaling and displacement parameters. Quite approximate estimates
of their positions are adequate unless the analysis has a special
interest in hydrogen atoms, but many analysts are over-occupied
with details of their placement.
ii. The use of isotropic adps (because of a ‘shortage’ of data) for
residues that are clearly subject to anisotropic libration. A group
adp would be a better approximation, or individual anisotropic
adps plus copious appropriate adp restraints.
iii. Omission of disordered solvent. It is very rare to ﬁnd an empty
void in a crystal structure, but there is no reason why disordered
solvent should be modelled only by partial atoms. This is a conve-
nient model if the disorder can be rationalized, but in other cases

13.7
Pseudo-symmetry, wrong space groups and Z′ > 1 structures
183
it may be more sensible to use models based on continuous elec-
tron distributions, or to use the discrete Fourier transform of the
‘electron density’ appearing in Fo maps in this region.
13.6.2
Over-parameterization
If the model is made too complex to be supported by the informa-
tion contained in the X-ray data, then some parameters may reﬁne to
inappropriate values. The indeterminacy may not be concentrated in
certain speciﬁc parameters, but may be distributed over a combina-
tion of parameters. Eigenvalue analysis of the normal equations should
reveal this.
Here are some examples:
i. reﬁnement of individual adps without restraints when there is a
shortage of good data;
ii. reﬁnement of the Flack parameter when the anomalous differences
cannot be discerned;
iii. reﬁnement of occupancy factors for chemically mixed sites in the
absence of high-quality high-angle data.
Some analysts (and some journals!) like to use the ratio (number
of observations):(number of parameters) as a measure of over/under-
parameterization. This is very naive, since it takes no account of the
information content or precision of the data. Dumping hundreds of
unobserved high-angle data into a reﬁnement will improve this ratio,
but have no useful inﬂuence on the analysis. For non-centrosymmetric
space groups it is valid to keep Friedel pairs separate if there is detectable
anomalous scattering, but for most all-light atom structures with Mo
radiation, it is purely cosmetic.
The ‘goodness of ﬁt’, S, would be a good measure of parameterization
if the weight were the inverse of the variance of the observation, but in
general the weights are adjusted, and it is usual to get an S value of
about 1 anyway. Note that scaling all the weights by the same factor to
give an S of unity has no effect at all on the reﬁned parameters (13.7).
S2 = (w2)/(n −m)

13.7
Pseudo-symmetry, wrong space groups
and Z′ > 1 structures
Most structures contain some local non-crystallographic symmetry (e.g.
phenyl groups). This is rarely harmful, and can sometimes be used
as the basis for equations of restraint. More troublesome is the situ-
ation in which the pseudo-symmetry affects almost the whole of the
structure. This situation is commonly found in structures with Z′ > 1,
when the independent molecules are related by the pseudo-symmetry

184
Reﬁnement of crystal structures
operator. The two most troublesome pseudo-operators are a false cen-
tre of symmetry, and a false translation of about 1/2 parallel to a cell
axis. Both cases lead to normal matrices showing high correlation
between pairs of parameters. For the pseudo-centre, the reﬁnements
often seem to proceed satisfactorily, and it is only at the evaluation
stage that the problems become evident. Symptoms are adps for equiv-
alent atoms unsatisfactory in complementary ways (e.g. one set large,
the other small) and bond lengths are similarly unsatisfactory. Pseudo-
translational symmetry is even more pernicious, since it leads to 50%
of the data being systematically weak. The situation can generally be
controlled by restraints or constraints.
Therearepairsofspacegroupsthatareindistinguishablefromthesys-

Conclusion
Reﬁnement in the sense of both choosing what parameters to optimize,
and obtaining the best parameter values, is frequently a tedious and
a not very cost-effective procedure. Much more time can be spent ﬁd-
dling about with a disordered side chain or solvent than was spent in
determining the gross structure. Before getting too involved in this unre-
warding task, make an effort to try to display and carefully look at the
electron density in the problematic region. It may be that there is no
useful atomic parameterization for the time and space averaging that
occurred during the experiment. If the issue is really important, look for
a better crystal, handle it carefully, cool it slowly to the lowest tempera-
ture you can achieve, and take care to optimize the data collection and
pre-processing.

Analysis of extended
inorganic structures

Introduction
Extended inorganic structures† frequently present a set of challenges to
†Here we use the term ‘extended structure’
to refer to materials such as metal oxides
or other ‘inorganic’ materials or minerals
where no ‘molecular’ units can be identi-
ﬁed. Similar considerations may apply to
materials such as co-ordination polymers.
the crystallographer different from those encountered in small-molecule
crystallography. Whilst a synthetic organic chemist might be content
with a ‘rough and ready’ structure that tells him/her that the basic
connectivity of a target molecule has been achieved, with an extended
inorganic material usually ‘the devil is in the detail’ – it is only by under-
standing the most subtle features of a material’s structure that one can
truly understand its properties. It is vital that studies on extended sys-
tems are performed with extreme care in order that such subtleties are
not overlooked.
Some of the problems that one might encounter when looking at this
class of material include the following.
• Crystal size: extended structures often have extremely low solubil-
ities in common solvents and precipitate rapidly during synthesis
or are made by solid-state reactions such that only tiny crystals or
polycrystalline samples are available.
• Disorder: many extended structures exhibit structural or composi-
tional disorder.
• Scattering power: the contribution of, for example, an oxygen atom
(8 electrons) to the diffraction pattern of an oxide containing
bismuth (83 electrons) is extremely low.
• Absorption: extended structures frequently contain highly absorb-
ing elements, making the use of good absorption corrections
(spherical/faceted crystals), suitably sized crystals, and an appro-
priate choice of radiation crucial.
• Phase transitions: extended materials frequently undergo phase
transitions as a function of temperature. These can lead to crys-
tals shattering or twinning (see Chapter 18) or subtle departures
from higher-symmetry structures.

Analysis of extended inorganic structures
• Incommensurate structures: competing structural forces in extended
materials can lead to non-periodic structures.
• Pseudo-symmetry: either subtle structural distortions or diffraction
data being dominated by heavy elements can make space group
choice difﬁcult – symmetry-breaking reﬂections can often be very
weak.
• Structure solution: many of the above problems mean that push-
ing the default ‘solve’ button in an integrated software package
will fail.
This chapter contains a brief overview of some of the above areas,
some case histories that illustrate several of the problems, and some
information on how structures can be validated once determined.
14.2
Disorder
In many cases, the presence of disorder in small-molecule crystallog-
raphy is simply an inconvenience during structure determination and
not in itself of any scientiﬁc importance. If, for example, a chemist has
used a conveniently sized anion such as BF−
4 or PF−
6 to crystallize a new
compound, or a material contains a poorly ordered solvent molecule,
one might be happy to simply ‘mop up’ the scattering due to the dis-
ordered portion of the structure in order to obtain better information
on the part of interest. There are often a number of ways in which this
can be done, some based on plausible structural models and others (e.g.
SQUEEZE-type algorithms) not.
Fig. 14.1 The ideal ABO3 perovskite struc-
ture; the 12-co-ordinate A atom is sur-
rounded by corner-sharing BO6 octahedra.
In contrast, there are countless problems in materials chemistry where
understanding disorder is key to understanding structure–property
relationships. As a simple example, the 1:1 binary alloy FePt can be
prepared in a disordered form where Fe and Pt randomly occupy the
sites of a face-centred cubic structure; this material is magnetically soft.
By careful annealing, however, one can redistribute the Fe and Pt atoms
such that they form ordered layers in the structure. The ordered mate-
rial has one of the highest magnetocrystalline anisotropies known and
is of interest for magnetic storage applications. In a material such as
the perovskite La1−xSrxMnO3 (Fig. 14.1) introducing occupational dis-
order via Sr doping on the La site (colloquially the ‘A site’) dramatically
changes the electronic and magnetic properties of the material. At ﬁrst
sight one might ascribe this merely to the changing MnIII/MnIV ratio
on doping and imagine that the value of x (which could be measured
crystallographically by reﬁning site occupancies) would be the only
structural effect of interest. However, many other factors are crucial:
changing the La:Sr ratio affects the average size of theA-site cation – this
might inﬂuence Mn–O–Mn bond angles in the material, changing the
width of the conduction band; oxidizing d4 MnIII to d3 MnIV changes a
Jahn–Teller-active cation into a Jahn–Teller-inactive one – this will cause
different patterns of distortion in the MnO6 octahedra and could cause

Disorder

a structural phase transition. In fact, it has recently been shown that in
many materials, even if one keeps the average size and average charge of
an A-site cation constant (e.g. by substituting with a ﬁxed ratio of 2+/3+
cations of different sizes), one can drastically inﬂuence a system’s prop-
erties (see, e.g., Attﬁeld et al., 1998). Disorder is thus a crucial parameter
in determining a material’s properties.
14.2.1
Site-occupancy disorder
In many cases studying occupational disorder can be relatively straight-
forward. For a simple system such as a cation-deﬁcient oxide A1−δO, a
single diffraction experiment (which simply measures the relative scat-
tering strength from metal and oxygen sites) would allow one to reﬁne
a fractional occupancy of the A site (along with any other free variables)
to determine δ. One would want to be careful that δ does not corre-
late signiﬁcantly with other parameters such as adps, but the problem
is soluble. For a more complex oxide AaBbO with two cations on the
same site the problem is more challenging. If one has good chemical
reasons to do so (e.g. if A and B are both known to be cations that dis-
play only a +2 oxidation state), one might be able to say that a + b = 1
such that the problem can be rewritten as A1−δBδO and is again solu-
ble from a single diffraction measurement. Such relationships can be
set up during reﬁnement via either crystallographic constraints or, for
more complex situations, restraints. If such an assumption is not possi-
ble (e.g. the true situation is AaBb(Vacancy)cO) then a single diffraction
measurement will not do – one needs more information. If A and B
have different neutron-scattering lengths then one might attempt a com-
bined X-ray and neutron reﬁnement; alternatively one might choose to
perform an anomalous scattering experiment, exploiting the fact that
the relative scattering power of elements can change dramatically close
to an absorption edge. In some cases it might be necessary to change
the isotope of the element of interest (different isotopes have different
neutron-scattering lengths) to provide more information, though this
can be both expensive and synthetically challenging.
It is also worth mentioning that there are some simple systems where
turning to neutrons will not help. Take a simple metal oxyﬂuoride
MO1−δFδ, for example. Oxygen and ﬂuorine have sufﬁciently similar
X-ray scattering powers (8 and 9 electrons, respectively) and neutron
scattering lengths (5.803 and 5.654 fm) that they are extremely difﬁcult
todistinguishbydiffraction.Onemighthavetoturntoalternativeexper-
imental techniques such as solid-state NMR or theoretical calculations
to probe O/F distribution in such a material.
As a ﬁnal comment, it is worth noting that, despite low R factors,
a structural model might be only as good as the assumptions used to
derive it. Let us return to the simple example of a metal oxide, MO. As
stated above, a single diffraction experiment can solve the M1−δO metal
vacancy problem. Equally it could solve an MO1−ε oxygen vacancy
problem (though the sensitivity would generally be lower with X-rays).

Data for Ti0.8O0.8 are indistinguishable from those for TiO.
What if there are vacancies on both the metal and oxygen sites? As
can be seen in Fig. 14.2, for δ = ε the diffraction pattern of a disordered
M1−δO1−ε materialisidentical tothatofMO.Thismightseeman‘exotic’
issue to worry about, but even a material as simple as ‘stoichiometric’
TiO actually contains around 1/6 vacancies on both the metal and oxy-
gen sites. For complex disorder problems the use of other techniques
(chemical analysis, density measurements, oxidation-state determina-
tion by other techniques, electron microscopy, solid-state NMR, etc.)
can therefore be vital.
14.2.2
Positional disorder
A second type of disorder frequently encountered is positional disorder
where an atom, or a group of atoms, can occupy one of two or more
sites in a structure. In some cases this is a genuine phenomenon and
can be tackled by introducing partial occupancy on several sites, often
coupled with suitable constraints or restraints. In other cases, however,
apparent disorder could arise due to the wrong choice of space group
or twinning. It should not be forgotten that site and occupational order
may be connected. If one had a material with a solid solution of La3+ (r =
1.30 Å) and Bi3+ (r = 1.31 Å) on the same site one might not be surprised
if the active lone-pair cation Bi3+ adopted a slightly different position to
La3+. How does one deal with this during reﬁnement? How does one
relate adps for the two cations? Ingenuity and a critical viewpoint are
required!

14.2.3
Limits of Bragg diffraction
It should be remembered that Bragg diffraction can only ever tell you
about the average long-range structure of a material and that this can
potentially hide signiﬁcant features of its structure. Consider the two
structures in Fig. 14.3. Both represent a simple material in which 30%
of the available sites are vacant. The two structures can be readily dis-
tinguished visually: in one the vacancies are randomly distributed; in
the second they are clustered – if one site is vacant the adjacent site is
more likely to be vacant. Clearly, real-world examples of such mate-
rials could have drastically different properties. Bragg scattering is,
however, completely blind to these differences and the diffracted inten-
sities of hkl reﬂections of the two materials are identical (Fig. 14.3). The
difference in the structures is revealed only by looking at the diffuse
scattering between Bragg peaks. In a single-crystal experiment this is
seen as streaks between hkl reﬂections; in a powder experiment it is one
contribution (of several) to the background scattering. The examples in
Fig. 14.3 were kindly supplied by Thomas Proffen. There is an excellent
website that explores these ideas further and allows on-line simulations

and Proffen, 2008; Egami and Billinge, 2003).
Fig. 14.4 The ideal structure of WO3.
14.3
Phase transitions
Phase transitions are a feature of much of the structural chemistry of
extended materials. WO3 is an apparently simple structure made up of
corner-sharing WO6 octahedra (Fig. 14.4). As such, one might expect it
to have a simple ∼4 Å cubic unit cell and space group Pm¯3m. In reality,
however, its structural chemistry is far more complex. Phase transitions
can occur that involve coupled tiltings of the WO6 octahedra, and/or in
which W atoms move from the centres of octahedra in different direc-
tions. WO3 is said to show more phase transitions than any other oxide
and it is only recently that controversy over the true structures of some
of the phases appears to have been resolved.
Part of the difﬁculty caused by phase transitions (particularly dis-
placive phase transitions) is that they often lead to only subtle changes
in diffraction patterns, with the relative intensities of reﬂections related
by symmetry in the high-symmetry form showing only slight changes.
Powder diffraction, in which the splitting of, e.g., a cubic 200 reﬂection
into the 200, 020 and 002 reﬂections of an orthorhombic system as the
cell metric changes from a = b = c to a ∼b ∼c can sometimes be directly
observed, is often a powerful tool – particularly as it avoids the prob-
lems of twinning in single-crystal samples. Phase transitions will often
lead to the formation of superstructures in which the dimensions of one
or more cell edges are doubled or tripled relative to the high-symmetry
structure. If the atoms that move most in the phase transition make only
a small contribution to diffraction (e.g., the movement of oxygen atoms
in a metal oxide), such effects can again be easily missed.
Finally, phase transitions can also lead to incommensurately modu-
lated structures that present further structural complexity. Consider the
simple structure in Fig. 14.5 that represents a one-dimensional chain of
atoms with a repeat distance a. If a structural change occurs in which
each atom is displaced laterally according to the magnitude of a sine

wave with λ = 3a, then this can easily be seen to cause a tripling of the
a-axis. In a diffraction pattern one would expect extra reﬂections to be
observed at points in reciprocal space between the original reﬂections
(withindicesnh/3, k, lcomparedtotheoriginalsubcellreﬂections).What
if the sine wave describing the structural displacements is not exactly
λ = 3a but λ ∼3a? The basic structure of the material produced (Fig. 14.5
right) is clearly very similar to that in Fig. 14.5 left. However, the unit
cell of the material is no longer a simple multiple of the original subcell.
One would again expect to see extra superstructure reﬂections, but they
would no longer appear at simple rational positions between the subcell
reﬂections. It might be that one can approximate the system by choosing
a very large supercell. For example, in Fig. 14.5 one could approximate
the superstructure using asup = 10asub. However, this is clearly a rather
inelegant approach as one now has a large unit cell requiring a large
number of atoms in the asymmetric unit. There is a more natural lan-
guage to describe such systems – that of ‘incommensurately modulated
structures’ – which can be used to describe either positional or com-
positional ﬂuctuations in materials. This language views the periodic
superstructuremerelyasaspecialcaseofthemoregeneralphenomenon.
More detailed information can be found in a number of places, but is
beyond the scope of this text.
14.4
Structure validation
Assuming that one has successfully solved the structure of an inorganic
material, how can one be sure it is correct? For small-molecule work an
experienced crystallographer will know that a C–C bond length should
be about 1.54 Å, and C=C 1.34 Å; for more exotic distances one can eas-
ily consult the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen, 2002). Distances
signiﬁcantly different from those expected would immediately cause
concern about the structural model. For inorganic materials such com-
parisons are harder. Co-ordination environments are far less regular,
the range of possible environments is larger, different oxidation states
of elements have different geometric preferences, and there is no direct
equivalent of the CSD to consult.† Whilst simple structural considera-
† There are inorganic databases available
such as the ICSD, PDF-4 and Pauling ﬁle,
but they are not as readily interrogated as
the CSD. Inorganic structures can be read
into CSD software to provide searchable
databases but one should always be aware
of bias in the data. How does one take
account of the fact that, e.g., TiO2 appears
113 times in the database when trying to
decide an average Ti–O distance for a range
of materials?
tions using ionic radii (the sets derived from those initially published
by Shannon and Prewitt in 1969 are the the most widely used; see, for
example, Shannon, 1976) are possible, they are often not desperately
informative.
One relatively straightforward approach is to make use of the bond-
valence concept popularized by Brown and Altermatt (1985), which
builds on ideas originally applied to metals and intermetallics by Paul-
ing in 1947. The basis of the approach is that each bond from atom i to
atom j is assigned a valence vij such that the sum of valences for bonds
from a given atom equals its total valence, V (=vij). The most widely
used expression for the dependence of bond valence on bond length is:
vij = exp[(Rij −dij)/b].

parameter’ and b a constant usually taken to be 0.37 Å. Whilst the-
oretical justiﬁcations of this method have been published, it is usual
to treat the expression as an empirical but effective tool. Brese and
O’Keeffe (1991) have taken this approach and published bond-valence
parameters Rij for most common cation–anion combinations using over
1000 carefully chosen crystal structures. These values can be found
on a number of websites including http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/web-
mirrors/i_d_brown/.
Bond-valence parameters can be used in a number of ways. The most
obvious is to check the validity of a structural model. If a crystal struc-
ture is correct, then one would expect the bond-valence sum for each
element to be close to its formal valency. Values for a typical inorganic
structure (BiMg2VO6 of case history 1) are shown in Table 14.1. Typ-
ically, one would expect valence sums to be within a few per cent of
formal valencies. Values outside this range could suggest an incorrect
model, that one has used valence parameters for the wrong oxidation
state of the element, that the material is highly strained, or that part of
the structure is missing. In this latter context bond-valence sums are par-
ticularly useful for identifying missing H atoms in inorganic structures.
Bond-valence parameters can also be used (via (14.1)) for calculating
expected radii for a given element/anion conﬁguration, or as a criterion
for determining co-ordination numbers (for example, how important is
an oxygen anion at 3.1 Å to the co-ordination environment of a Bi3+
cation? Answer: it contributes <2% of the valence sum, so not very!).

Case history 1 – BiMg2VO6
Bismuth magnesium vanadate is a material whose structure was ﬁrst
reported in orthorhombic space group Cmcm by Huang and Sleight
(1992). Materials of this type have been investigated for catalytic and

non-linear optical (NLO) properties. With a material of this formula
one might anticipate problems due to pseudo-symmetry (because of
the heavy Bi atom) and signiﬁcant absorption.
To illustrate both these potential pitfalls data have recently been col-
lected on this material using a Bruker SMART 6000 diffractometer using
Mo-Kα radiation. Afull sphere of data was collected with a frame width
of 0.3◦and a counting time of 20 s per frame. Using a default set of
thresholding parameters the same cell and space group were found as in
the published structure (though we actually chose a non-standard space
group setting Bbmm rather than Cmcm for analysis). The structure would
solve and reﬁne without any difﬁculties. Final agreements of R = 2.10%,
wR = 5.64% were obtained for 552 reﬂections after anisotropic reﬁne-
ment and application of an optimal weighting scheme in the Oxford
CRYSTALS suite of software. Bond distances and angles were all close
to expected values and the co-ordinates were essentially as published.
However, it can be seen from Fig. 14.6 that, whilst the adps on most
atoms are what one might expect for a material of this type, one oxygen
atom has an adp that is physically unreasonable and might suggest that
this oxygen site should be split. In fact, careful examination of the raw
frames shows that additional weak reﬂections are present that violate
the cell centring and show that the true space group of this material
is Pnma. Reﬁnement in this lower-symmetry space group proceeded
smoothly, giving ﬁnal R-factors for the 1054 observed reﬂections of
R = 2.13%, wR = 5.27%, with all atoms now showing physically sensi-
ble adps. It can be seen from Fig. 14.6 that the structure is only subtly
different from the Bbmm model. Note that in this case the correct struc-
ture has an R factor that is slightly higher than the incorrect structure
due to the larger number of reﬂections.
In fact, since the original publication this material has been shown
to undergo a displacive phase transition on warming above ∼300 K
from the primitive to the centred structure (Radosavljevic and Sleight,
2000). In the high-temperature structure the oxygen atoms of the VO4

Analysis of extended inorganic structures
tetrahedra again show extended adps, which this time are indicative of
dynamic disorder (Fig. 14.7).
The importance of an adequate absorption correction when working
with materials of this type can be seen from Table 14.2 and Fig. 14.8.

Case history 2 – Mo2P4O15

The crystal used for these experiments was an elongated prism of
dimensions 0.02 × 0.03 × 0.27 mm. Without any absorption correction
a merging R factor of 25.8% was obtained. On full anisotropic reﬁne-
ment ﬁnal agreement factors of R = 6.75, wR = 10.85% were achieved.
The best model could be obtained by application of a combined face-

14.6
Case history 2 – Mo2P4O15
From its formula Mo2P4O15 would appear to be a relatively simple
inorganic material and one might therefore expect it to have a simple
structure. In fact, the structure of the material was reported by Costentin
et al. (1992) in space group P21/c with unit cell parameters a = 8.3065,
b = 6.5154, c = 10.7102 Å, β = 106.695◦, V = 555.20Å3. The cell thus
contains a total of 2 formula units and can be described using 11 atoms in
the asymmetric unit. The structure contains MoO6 octahedra that share
5 of their 6 corners with PO4 tetrahedra. The PO4 tetrahedra themselves
share corners to give P4O13 groups (Fig. 14.9). However, despite the
structure being chemically plausible and having an R factor of 3.6%,
there were certain features that were puzzling, including (see Fig. 14.10)
rather large adps on certain atoms.

Fig. 14.10 Left: a polyhedral view of the true superstructure of Mo2P4O15; the incorrect small unit cell is also shown. Middle: adps
(drawn at the 70% probability level) derived from 120 K data using the incorrect subcell model. Right: true atomic positions mapped
back onto the incorrect subcell. Notice the similarity between the incorrect adps and the true static displacements of atoms.
When we re-collected data on this material using a Bruker SMART
6000 it became clear that the true unit cell of this material was consid-
erably more complex than had been initially realized. The actual cell
volume was some 21 times larger than that originally reported, the true
room-temperature cell parameters being a = 24.133(2), b = 19.579(2),
c = 25.109(2) Å, β = 99.962(3)◦, V = 11685.13 Å3. The unit cell must
then contain some 42 formula units. Automated data processing using
the Bruker XPREP software suggested that the space group was P21/n.
However,carefulmanualinspectionofthereﬂectionlistingrevealedthat
reﬂections forbidden by the 21 axis were in fact present, albeit weak [the
strongest 0k0 reﬂection observed with k ̸= 2n was 070 with I = 1.54(3);
this ranked 13 352nd of the observed reﬂections ordered by intensity;
by comparison the strongest reﬂection observed had I = 9300(120)],
meaning that the true space group was Pn. This in turn implies that the
asymmetric unit of the material must contain 441 independent atoms –
some 430 more than originally thought!
Solving a structure of this complexity that displays severe pseudo-
symmetry is clearly challenging. We took the approach of ﬁrst solving
the substructure using the unit cell originally published. Using 120 K
data we could reﬁne the substructure to R = 9.5%, though again adps
on certain atoms were rather large. By comparing the indices hkl of
certain reﬂections based on the (wrong) small unit cell with those of
the correct larger cell we could obtain a transformation matrix to relate
the two structures (see Exercise 3 at the end of this chapter). We could
then transform the subcell co-ordinates to give a starting model for the
high-temperature structure.
Despite now having a chemically plausible starting model, least-
squares reﬁnement is not straightforward. As described in Chapter 13,
if one tries to directly reﬁne a high-symmetry structure in a lower-
symmetry space group the least-squares will invariably diverge. How
then does one move forward? In this case we know a great deal of useful
information about the structure: we know that it contains MoO6 octahe-
dra that share corners with PO4 tetrahedra; we know from the literature
that MoO6 octahedra typically contain 4 Mo–O bonds around 2.05 Å,

14.6
Case history 2 – Mo2P4O15
201
1 short M=O around 1.65 Å and 1 longer M–O around 2.20 Å; we know
that P–O bonds of PO4 tetrahedra are typically around 1.5 Å; and we
know that P–O bonds in P–O–P linkages are typically slightly longer,
around 1.60 Å. Given this information it is possible to generate a set
of distance restraints to describe the structure and to reﬁne the struc-
tural model, not against a set of diffraction data but directly against the
restraints. The quantity minimized is then the sum of the squared dif-
ferences between prescribed distances and the distances in the model.
Atoms are moved until these differences are minimized. This is called
distance least squares or DLS reﬁnement and has been used to great
effect for many inorganic systems and particularly zeolite frameworks
(see publications by Baerlocher and co-workers). By performing DLS
reﬁnement it is possible to produce plausible structural models, which
can be tested against the data.
In this example it proved relatively straightforward to solve the struc-
ture by simultaneously reﬁning against both the data and the DLS
restraints (252 in total to describe Mo–O distances; 336 to describe P–O
distances; 630/504, respectively, for MoO6/PO4 bond angles; Mo–O
restraints were set up in such a way that each octahedron could have a
range of distances to allow for the expected mixture of short and long
bonds). We used a simulated annealing approach in which we started
reﬁnement from the subcell co-ordinates and then reﬁned the structure
against data and restraints simultaneously to convergence. At conver-
gence, co-ordinates were automatically reset to their initial values ± a
small random displacement and the reﬁnement repeated. This process
was performed on a relatively small 2θ range of data for speed, but
rapidly resulted in a solution with a low R factor. This solution was
then reﬁned against the whole dataset without any restraints to give
R = 3.49% and wR = 5.99% for 43783 reﬂections with I > 3σ(I). It
is perhaps worth noting that new charge ﬂipping methods can solve
pseudo-symmetry problems such as this far more easily.
The true structure of Mo2P4O15 is necessarily complicated! Fig. 14.10
shows the structure in polyhedral representation. The ﬁgure also shows
a comparison of the incorrect literature model with the true structure
‘folded back’ into the small unit cell (this can be done by applying the
reverse of the transformation matrix used to generate the initial super-
structure model). Here, each of the atomic positions in the true supercell
becomes one of several closely separated positions in the subcell. It is
instructive to note that the shape of the adps obtained using the incorrect
small cell are closely related to the true static displacements of atoms in
the larger cell.
How can one judge the quality of a structural model for an inor-
ganic crystal structure such as this? Normally one would compare bond
distances and angles with expected values or calculate bond valence
sums for the various atoms in the structure. With a structure this com-
plex (it contains 42 different MoO6 octahedra and 84 PO4 tetrahedra),
the structure can be checked for internal self-consistency – it acts as
its own database. Isotropic displacement parameters for all atoms lay

the 3 atom types were: 42× Mo 0.0051–0.0062, average = 0.0056 Å2;

84 PO4 tetrahedra deviated by < 0.15 units (3%) from expected values.
With 42 MoO6 octahedra in the structure one would expect 42 ‘short’
Mo–O bonds, 168 ‘medium’ Mo–O bonds and 42 ‘long’ Mo–O bonds.
For the 84 PO4 tetrahedra that link to form P4O13 units one would expect
210 short P–O bonds and 126 longer P–O–P bonds. The histograms in
Fig. 14.11 show exactly this distribution!

The derivation of results
Simon Parsons and William Clegg
15.1
Introduction
The parameters obtained from the least-squares reﬁnement are a set
of co-ordinates and displacement parameters for each atom, and from
these we are able to calculate geometrical parameters of interest: bond
lengths, bond angles, torsion angles, least-squares planes with angles
between them, intermolecular and other non-bonded distances. We can
analyze the movement of the atoms and, perhaps, make some correc-
tions to the apparent geometrical values we have calculated. To every
derived result we can attach a standard uncertainty as a measure of its
precision or reliability.
We must begin to interpret the results, to detect patterns, common
features, signiﬁcant differences and variations, and to make deductions
on the basis of the observed geometry. We shall need to compare fea-
tures within the structure, and also compare them with other related
structures.
15.2
Geometry calculations
So now we have a converged reﬁnement with which we are satisﬁed.
The primary results include three co-ordinates for each atom. The sec-
ondary results, generally of greater interest, are parameters describing
the molecular geometry.
15.2.1
Fractional and Cartesian co-ordinates
The positions of atoms in least-squares reﬁnement are (almost) always
expressed as fractional atomic co-ordinates. Familiar formulae for the
calculation of distances, angles, etc., assume, however, that the co-
ordinates are referred to Cartesian axes. One approach to calculating
geometric parameters from crystallographic data is to transform the
fractional coordinates into Cartesian co-ordinates. In order to do this the
Cartesian frame (deﬁned by vectors X, Y and Z) must be deﬁned in terms
of the crystallographic unit cell axes (a, b and c). There are an inﬁnite
number of ways in which this can be done, but one common deﬁnition
is to allow the Cartesian X-axis to lie along the crystallographic a-axis
205

and the Cartesian Y-axis to lie in the crystallographic ab-plane, perpen-
dicular to X. The Cartesian Z-axis is then parallel to c* (more generally it
is given by the vector product X × Y). The matrix relationship between
these two sets of axes is

Geometry calculations

Once a set of Cartesian co-ordinates has been derived ordinary Carte-
sian geometry can be applied to calculations of distances, angles and
so on. Cartesian co-ordinates are also useful when making comparisons
of structures, or as a common co-ordinate framework for superposition
calculations.
15.2.2
Bond distance and angle calculations
An alternative method for calculating geometric parameters, which is
frequently more computationally convenient, is to apply vector meth-
ods directly to fractional co-ordinates themselves. Suppose we have
two atoms with fractional co-ordinates [x1, y1, z1] and [x2, y2, z2]; the
interatomic vector will be:
r = [(x1 −x2)a + (y1 −y2)b + (z1 −z2)c].
(15.6)
The length (magnitude) of this vector can be evaluated from its dot
product with itself:
|r|2 = r.r = [(x1 −x2)a + (y1 −y2)b + (z1 −z2)c]
. [(x1 −x2)a + (y1 −y2)b + (z1 −z2)c]
= (ax)2 + (by)2 + (cz)2 + 2bc cos αyz
+ 2ac cos βxz + 2ab cos γ xy.
(15.7)
Bond angles, θ, can also be evaluated from dot products: if two
interaction vectors u and v are represented as in (15.6), then
u.v = |u||v| cos θ.
(15.8)
Alternatively, for three atoms A–B–C the angle θ is also given by the
‘cosine rule’
cos θ = r2
BA + r2
BC −r2

(15.9)
Torsion angles measure the conformational twist about a series of four
atoms bonded together in sequence in a chain A–B–C–D. The torsion
angle is deﬁned as the rotation about the B–C bond that is required
to bring B–A into coincidence with C–D when viewed from B to C. The
generally accepted sign convention is that a positive torsion angle corre-
sponds to a clockwise rotation. Regrettably, this convention is opposite
to that used to deﬁne positive rotations elsewhere in geometry. Note
that (i) the torsion angle D–C–B–A is identical in magnitude and sign to
the torsion angle A–B–C–D, so there is no ambiguity in the description
of the angle; (ii) the torsion angles for equivalent sets of atoms in a pair
of enantiomers have equal magnitudes but opposite signs, so that all
torsion angles change sign if a structure is inverted. Formulae for the
calculation of torsion angles are given by Dunitz (1979).

Note that G is symmetric because b.c = c.b, and that it can be evaluated
from the cell dimensions because b.c = bc cos α, etc. The matrix G is
called the metric tensor, and is extremely important. An equivalent recip-
rocal metric tensor can be deﬁned using the reciprocal lattice basis vectors,
and this is usually given the symbol G∗. The following relationships are
often useful:
G−1 = G∗
(15.11)
V = |G|1/2
(15.12)
V∗= |G∗|1/2.

Suppose we wish to transform our unit cell using a 3 × 3 matrix R from
the A-basis to another basis, B, where
B = RA.
This may be because we wish to model the structure in a different space
group, or to compare one structure with another. It will be clear that we
also need to transform our co-ordinates, x, to another set, y.
The same vector r can now be expressed in two ways:
r = ATx
r = BTy,
so that
ATx = BTy.
But B = RA, and so
ATx = (RA)Ty.
Recalling that (AB)T = BTAT,
ATx = ATRTy
x = RTy

RT−1
x = y,
(15.16)
which is the desired relationship: if a unit cell is transformed with a
matrix R, the co-ordinates should be transformed with (RT)−1 = (R−1)T.
Thisexplainswhythetransformationsusedin(15.1)and(15.2)arediffer-
ent from those used in (15.3) and (15.4). The same matrix R used to trans-
form the direct cell axes can also be used to transform reﬂection indices.
15.2.5
Standard uncertainties
Although the occasional distance or angle can be calculated by hand
(for example, where a non-bonded distance is required, but is not listed
automatically by the reﬁnement program because it is too long), these
derivations are tedious, and are best left to automatic computer pro-
grams. Even more to the point, the correct calculation of s.u.s for the
molecular geometry parameters requires inclusion of covariance terms
(see Chapter 16), because atomic co-ordinates are not uncorrelated; the
necessary covariances, produced automatically by a full-matrix least-
squares reﬁnement (note: reﬁnements not based on a full matrix do not
give all the covariances, and also tend to underestimate variances), are

210
The derivation of results
not normally preserved and output after the reﬁnement, so only approx-
imate s.u.s can be calculated using parameter s.u.s alone. The approxi-
mationwillbeaparticularlypooronewhensymmetry-equivalentatoms
are involved, e.g. for a bond across an inversion centre, or an angle at
an atom on a mirror plane.
Note that any parameter that is varied in the least-squares reﬁne-
ment will have an associated s.u., and any parameter that is held ﬁxed
will not. Usually, the three co-ordinates and six anisotropic Uij (or one
isotropic U) for each atom are reﬁned, and each has an s.u. Symmetry
may, however, require that some parameters are ﬁxed, because atoms
lie on rotation axes, mirror planes or inversion centres; in this case, the
s.u. of such a ﬁxed parameter must be zero. This has an effect on the
s.u.s of bond lengths and other geometry involving these atoms, which
will tend to be smaller than they would be for reﬁned parameters. If
a co-ordinate of an atom has been ﬁxed in order to deﬁne a ﬂoating
origin in a space group with a polar axis (better methods are used in
most modern programs), the effect will be to produce artiﬁcially better
precision for the geometry around this atom.
Parameters that are equal by symmetry must have equal s.u.s. This
applies both to the primary reﬁned parameters (for example, atoms in
certain special positions in high-symmetry space groups have two or
more equal co-ordinates and relationships among some of the Uij com-
ponents), and also to the geometrical parameters calculated from them.
A good test of the correctness of the calculation of geometry s.u.s by
a program is to compare the bond lengths and their s.u.s for atoms in
special positions in trigonal and hexagonal space groups!
If a bond length (or other geometrical feature) has been constrained
during reﬁnement, the s.u. of this bond length must necessarily be zero,
even though the two atoms concerned will, in general, have non-zero
s.u.s for their co-ordinates; this is a consequence of correlation: the
covariance terms exactly cancel the variance terms in calculating the
bond length s.u. from the co-ordinate s.u.s. A good example of such a
situation is the ‘riding model’ for reﬁnement of hydrogen atoms, where
the C–H bond is held constant in length and direction during reﬁnement.
The C and H atoms have the same s.u.s for their co-ordinates (because
they are completely correlated), and the C–H bond length has a zero s.u.
By contrast, restrained bond lengths do have an s.u., because the restraint
is treated as an extra observation and the two atoms are actually reﬁned
normally. It is instructive to compare the calculated bond length and its
s.u. with the imposed restraint value and its weight, to see how valid
the restraint is in the light of the diffraction data.
For a group of atoms reﬁned as a ‘rigid group’, all internal geometrical
parameters will have zero s.u.s. The actually reﬁned parameters are the
three co-ordinates for some deﬁned point in the group (usually one atom
or the centroid) and three rotations for the group as a whole. Thus, dif-
ferent atoms in the group should have different co-ordinate s.u.s (this
is not the case with some reﬁnement programs, which do not calcu-
late these s.u.s correctly), and, once again, the effects of correlation and

15.3
Least-squares planes and dihedral angles
211
covariance are such as to give the required zero s.u.s for the geometry
of the group.
It is often overlooked that molecular geometry depends not only on
the atomic co-ordinates, but also on the unit cell parameters, and they
too are subject to uncertainties. Some reﬁnement programs make no
allowance for the uncertainties in the cell parameters, and the results
can be ridiculous, especially for the geometry around heavy atoms.
These usually have very low co-ordinate s.u. values, so bond lengths
and angles calculated without regard to cell parameter uncertainties
may have s.u.s proportionately very much smaller than the cell edge
s.u.s! If explicit treatment of this effect is not included in your geometry
calculation program, a simple hand adjustment can be made, by increas-
ing s.u.s by an amount depending on the ratio of the cell edges to their
s.u.s [σ(a)/a, σ(b)/b and σ(c)/c]; this usually affects only the heaviest
atoms in a structure of contrasting atomic scattering powers.
15.2.6
Assessing signiﬁcant differences
In crystallography we quote the standard uncertainty in parentheses,
for example 1.520(4) Å, for a bond length. The ﬁgure in parentheses
refers to the last quoted decimal place, and in this example the standard
uncertainty on our measurement of 1.520 Å is 0.004 Å; a measurement
of 1.52(4) Å is ten times less precise. See also Chapter 16 for further
discussion.
Application of arguments based on the normal distribution allows us
toconcludethattwoparameterscanbeconsideredsigniﬁcantlydifferent
if their difference () is more than 3 times the standard uncertainty of
the difference, i.e.

(15.17)
whereσ1 is the s.u. on theﬁrstparameter.Thisiscalledthe‘3σ rule’,butit
is important to recognize that the s.u.s from crystal-structure reﬁnement
are often thought to be underestimated by a factor of 1.5 to 2, and so
perhaps a 5σ rule is safer to use in practice.
15.3
Least-squares planes and
dihedral angles
It is sometimes desirable to assess whether a number of atoms are actu-
ally all in one plane and, if not, how much they deviate from coplanarity;
this is particularly the case for cyclic groups of atoms and for selected
atoms co-ordinating a central metal atom. When more than one exact
or approximate plane can be deﬁned in a structure, the angles between
pairs of planes may also be of interest.

212
The derivation of results
The usual method of assessing the planarity of a group of atoms is to
ﬁt an exact plane to the atomic positions by a least-squares calculation;
the plane is chosen so as to minimize n
i=1 wi2
i , where i is the per-
pendicular distance of the ith atom from the plane, there are n atoms to
be ﬁtted, and each has relative weight wi in the calculation. There are
various methods of actually performing the calculation, which can also
be expressed as a determination of one of the principal axes of inertia for
the group of atoms. In the calculation, the weights used for the atoms
should be proportional to 1/σ 2, where σ 2 is the variance for the atomic
position in the direction perpendicular to the required plane. As a rea-
sonable approximation, an overall average positional σ 2 may be used
for each atom, but even this is often not done and unit weights are used
instead. A very crude approximate scheme weights atoms proportion-
ally to their atomic numbers or atomic masses, since the heaviest atoms
usually have the smallest positional s.u. values.
Calculation of a least-squares plane also provides a ‘root-mean-square
deviation’ of the atoms from the plane
r.m.s. =
n
i=1 wi2
i
n
1/2
,
(15.18)
and this quantity may be used to assess whether the deviations from
planarity are signiﬁcant. A standard statistical test (the χ2 test) can be
applied, but it is rare for any set of more than three atoms to be judged
truly planar by this test (except for groups that are strictly planar by
symmetry, such as four atoms related in pairs by an inversion centre). It
is common to quote the deviations of individual atoms from the plane;
these atoms may be among those used to deﬁne the plane itself, or may
be other atoms. The calculation (and even the deﬁnition) of an s.u. for
such a deviation is not obvious, and various accounts have been given.
Generally, these involve considerable approximations and the neglect
of correlation effects.
Deviations of atoms from a least-squares plane are a much more sen-
sitive, and hence a better, estimate of whether the co-ordination about
an atom is essentially planar, than is the sum of the bond angles at that
atom. This sum will be quite close to 360◦even for a markedly pyra-
midal three-co-ordinate atom or for a square-planar coordination with
signiﬁcant tetrahedral distortion.
The terms ‘least-squares plane’ and ‘mean plane’ are used syn-
onymously by most crystallographers, although some authors have
distinguished between them, giving them different deﬁnitions.
The angle between two planes is sometimes called a dihedral angle,
though this term may also be used to mean the same as torsion angle, so
some care is needed. We must also be aware of an ambiguity in deﬁn-
ing the interplanar angle. The correct deﬁnition is the angle between
the normals to the two planes, but where two lines cross a choice can
be made between two possible angles, whose sum is 180◦. Where the
two planes concerned have two atoms in common, the dihedral angle

15.4
Hydrogen atoms and hydrogen bonding

represents a fold about the line joining these two atoms (a ‘hinge’ or
‘ﬂap’ angle), and it seems sensible to choose the angle enclosed by the
two hinged planes (so that the angle would be 0◦for a closed hinge and
180◦for a fully opened hinge), but the choice of angle is less obvious in
some other situations.
15.3.1
Conformation of rings and other
molecular features
It is in describing molecular features such as co-ordination, planes and
ring conformations that we move from unambiguous description to
interpretation. The conformation of rings can be described in many
ways (Dunitz, 1979). Common quantities used to describe ring con-
formations are torsion angles, atomic deviations from least-squares
planes, and angles between these planes, and on the basis of such
measures, rings are generally classiﬁed by such terms as chair, boat,
twist, envelope, etc. Ring conformations can also be analyzed in terms
of linear combinations of normal atomic displacements according to
irreducible representations of the Dnh point group symmetry appro-
priate to a regular planar n-membered ring. Other analyses may be in
terms of asymmetry parameters and puckering parameters, variously
deﬁned.
The shapes of co-ordination polyhedra around a central atom can
also be difﬁcult to describe, and we frequently see simple expressions
such as ‘distorted tetrahedral’ or ‘approximately octahedral’, which
may refer to extremely unsymmetrical arrangements!Attempts to quan-
tify these descriptions have included deﬁnitions of ‘twist angles’ and
other measures of the degree of distortion from regular co-ordination
shapes.
15.4
Hydrogen atoms and
hydrogen bonding
The distance between two atoms, together with its s.u., can be calculated
regardless of whether the two atoms are considered to be bonded to
each other. Distances between atoms in adjacent molecules may indicate
signiﬁcant intermolecular interactions, if they are shorter than some
‘expected’ or standard value (such as the sum of van der Waals radii for
the atoms concerned). Short contacts involving a hydrogen atom and
an electronegative atom are often examined as potential candidates for
hydrogen bonding. There are, however, some pitfalls to be avoided here.
Firstly, hydrogen atoms are not very precisely located by X-ray diffrac-
tion, because of their low electron density. Thus, freely reﬁned hydrogen
atoms will have larger positional s.u.s than other atoms. Some computer
programslistbondlengthswiths.u.s,butnon-bondeddistanceswithout
any estimate of precision. The relatively low precision of these distances
should not be overlooked in interpreting the distances themselves. Weak

214
The derivation of results
hydrogen bonding is sometimes postulated when the experimental
precision simply does not support it.
Secondly, hydrogen atom positions determined by X-ray diffraction
do not correspond to true nuclear positions, because the electron den-
sity is signiﬁcantly shifted towards the atom to which the hydrogen
atom is covalently bonded. Thus, typical bond lengths for freely reﬁned
atoms are around 0.95 Å for C–H and under 0.90 Å for N–H and O–H,
whereas true internuclear distances, obtained by spectroscopic meth-
ods for gas-phase molecules, or by neutron diffraction, are over 0.1 Å
longer. In hydrogen bonding, the hydrogen atom lies roughly between
its covalently bonded atom and the electronegative atom in a D–H…A
arrangement, so a signiﬁcant shortening error in the D–H bond length
means an incorrectly long H…A distance. This is another reason why
these distances should be interpreted with caution.
Thirdly, hydrogen atoms are constrained (or restrained) in many
structure determinations, and their positions are, therefore, to a large
extent dictated by pre-conceived ideas. Hydrogen bonding of any sig-
niﬁcance is likely, however, to perturb hydrogen atoms from ‘expected’
positions.
For these reasons, the D…A distance may often be a better (or at least
a safer) indication of hydrogen bonding. In any case, possible hydrogen
bonding that does not ﬁt in with widely recognized patterns should be
examined very carefully before it is presented to the public (Taylor and
Kennard, 1984)!
15.5
Displacement parameters
Although the major interest in a structure determination usually cen-
tres on the geometry, derived from the atomic positions, the primary
results also include the so-called ‘thermal parameters’. It has been
suggested that these describe not only the time-averaged temperature-
dependent movement of the atoms about their mean equilibrium
positions (dynamic disorder), but also their random distribution over
different sets of equilibrium positions from one unit cell to another,
representing a deviation from perfect periodicity in the crystal (static
disorder) which is not great enough to be resolved into distinct alter-
native sites), and so they should rather be called ‘atomic displacement
parameters’. Arefreshingly readable account has been written for a gen-
eral chemical audience, and is strongly recommended (Dunitz et al.,
1988). See also Downs (2000).
Interpretation and analysis of displacement parameters is not often
undertaken. One reason is that various systematic errors in the data,
inappropriate reﬁnement weights, and poor aspects of the structural
model all tend to affect these parameters, whereas the atomic positions
are much less perturbed (fortunately!). Thus, the ‘anisotropic tempera-
ture factors’ of a structure are often regarded as a sort of error dustbin,
and their physical signiﬁcance is questionable unless the experimental
work is of good quality.

15.5
Displacement parameters
215
15.5.1
βs, Bs and Us
It is unfortunate that atomic displacements are described by a variety of
different parameters, all of which are mathematically related. Thus, for
an isotropic model, a single parameter is used, but this may be called B
or U. These are related by
f′(θ) = f(θ) exp(−B sin2 θ/λ2) = f(θ) exp(−8π2U sin2 θ/λ2),
(15.19)
where f(θ) is the scattering factor for a stationary atom and f′(θ) the
scattering factor for the vibrating atom. B and U both have units of Å2
and U represents a mean-square amplitude of vibration.
For an anisotropic model, six parameters are used, and the exponent
(−B sin2 θ/λ2) becomes variously
−(β11h2 + β22k2 + β33l2 + 2β23kl + 2β13hl + 2β12hk) or
−1
4 (B11h2a∗2 + B22k2b∗2 + B33l2c∗2 + 2B23klb∗c∗+ 2B13hla∗c∗+ 2B12hka∗b∗) or
−2π2(U11h2a∗2 + U22k2b∗2 + U33l2c∗2 + 2U23klb∗c∗+ 2U13hla∗c∗+ 2U12hka∗b∗)
(15.20)
The ﬁrst form is most compact, but the six β terms are not directly
comparable (the factor 2 in the three cross-terms is sometimes omit-
ted, adding yet more confusion to the possible deﬁnitions!); the second
form is equivalent to the isotropic B, and the third to the isotropic U
expression.
These parameters are often represented graphically as ‘displacement
ellipsoids’ or ‘thermal ellipsoids’. Note that this is possible only if certain
inequality relationships among the six parameters are satisﬁed; other-
wise they are said to be ‘non-positive-deﬁnite’ and the corresponding
ellipsoid does not have three real principal axes. Such a situation may
indicate a real problem in the structural model (e.g. a disordered atom),
or it may just be due to imprecise (high s.u.s) Uij parameters, in which
case the anisotropic model for this atom is perhaps not justiﬁed.
15.5.2
‘The equivalent isotropic displacement
parameter’
Tables of anisotropic displacement parameters are very unlikely to be
published in most chemical journals, and their signiﬁcance is difﬁcult
to assess at a glance. For a simple assessment of the atomic motions,
it is convenient to calculate an equivalent isotropic parameter for each
atom. Different deﬁnitions of Ueq abound, and some of them seem to be
inappropriate (Watkin, 2000). Essentially, one version of the equivalent
isotropic parameter is that corresponding to a sphere of volume equal to
the ellipsoid representing, on the same probability scale, the anisotropic
parameters. The deﬁnition ‘Ueq = (1/3)(trace of the orthogonalized Uij
matrix)’isacommonlyusedone,butitsmeaningis,perhaps,notentirely

Asimplecalculationofthes.u.forUeq canbemadefromthes.u.softhe
Uij parameters, but it has been shown that a proper inclusion of covari-
ance terms (correlations among the Uij values), which are not always
available after the reﬁnement is complete, gives lower s.u. values, so the
simply calculated values are of dubious worth.
15.5.3
Symmetry and anisotropic displacement
parameters
Mathematically, the β values form a tensor, whereas the U and B values
do not, and so transformations of displacement parameters are most
simply applied to βs. If a symmetry operation involves a point operation
R, expressed as a 3 × 3 matrix, the βs transform as:
β′ = RβRT.
(15.22)
If an atom resides on a special position β′ = β, and this may impose
special values on or relationships between the components of β. For
example, for two atoms related by a two-fold rotational operation (i.e.
2 or 21) along [010],
β′ =

so that β12 = −β12 and β23 = −β23, which is possible only if β12 =

ellipsoid must be perpendicular to [010]. Least-squares reﬁnement will
become unstable if correct relationships are not applied as a constraint
during reﬁnement. Most modern reﬁnement programs (e.g. SHELXL
and CRYSTALS) will apply this automatically, but some will not.

Models of thermal motion and geometrical
corrections: rigid-body motion
It is well known that one effect of thermal vibration is to produce an
apparent shrinkage in molecular dimensions. Analysis of this effect and
correction for it is possible only in certain cases.
If a molecule has only small internal vibrations (both bond stretching
and angle deformations) compared with its movement as a whole about
its mean position in a crystal structure, then it can be treated approx-
imately as a rigid body. In this case, the movements of the individual
atoms are not independent and so the Uij parameters of the atoms must
be consistent with the overall molecular motion. This motion can be
described by a combination of three tensors (3 × 3 matrices): the over-
all translation (oscillation backwards and forwards in three dimensions),
represented by the six independent components of a symmetric tensor T
(analogous to the anisotropic U tensor for an individual atom); libration
(rotary oscillation), represented also by a symmetric tensor L; and screw
motion, represented by an unsymmetrical tensor S. This third contribu-
tion is necessary to describe the complete motion of a molecule that does
not lie on an inversion centre in the crystal structure, because there is
then correlation between translational and librational motion, such that
the librational axes do not all intersect at a single point. The tensor S actu-
ally has only eight independent components, because the three diagonal
terms are not all independent, so the whole molecular motion can be
described by 20 parameters. Except for very small molecules (and some
particular geometrical shapes), the six Uij values for each atom provide
more than enough data for a least-squares reﬁnement to determine these
20 parameters, and the agreement between observed and calculated Uij
values gives a measure of the usefulness of the rigid-body model.
From the rigid-body parameters, corrections can be calculated for
bond lengths within the molecule; these depend only on the librational
tensor components.
Although many molecules can not be regarded as even approximately
rigid, it may be possible to treat certain groups of atoms within them as
rigid bodies, and make corrections within those groups.
It is possible to test whether a molecule, or part of a molecule, might be
regarded as a rigid body (Hirschfeld, 1976). If a pair of atoms (whether
bonded together directly or not) behaves as part of a rigid group, then
theymustremainataﬁxeddistanceapartduringtheirconcertedmotion.
In this case, the components of their individual anisotropic vibrations
along the line joining them must be equal. Thus, a ‘rigid atom-pair’ test
computes these components of anisotropic motion:

U2
= U11d2
1 + U22d2
2 + U33d2
3 + 2U23d2d3 + 2U13d1d3 + 2U12d1d2,
(15.23)
where

U2
is the mean-square amplitude of vibration along a line that
has direction cosines d1, d2, d3 referred to reciprocal cell axes. Equality

218
The derivation of results
or near-equality of the

U2
values for the two atoms is a necessary (but
not sufﬁcient) condition for rigidity. This can be used as a test for rigid
bonds and for rigid bodies (the test must work for every pair of atoms
in the group being tested). It can also be used as the basis of a restraint
on Uij values in structure reﬁnement.
15.5.5
Atomic displacement parameters and
temperature
Although the Uij parameters of the atoms probably do not describe only
thermal vibration effects, as noted above, they are usually strongly tem-
perature dependent, and they can be drastically reduced by carrying out
data collection at a lower temperature. With reliable low-temperature
apparatus now available for X-ray diffractometers, this approach is
strongly to be recommended. Low-temperature data usually give
greater precision in atomic positions, more reliable molecular geome-
try, and an opportunity to assess and distinguish between dynamic and
static disorder: the former will be reduced at lower temperature, the lat-
ter will probably not. Although we are concerned in this chapter with
the analysis of results, we should bear in mind that this analysis can be
greatly helped by an improvement in the experimental measurements!

16.1
Random and systematic errors
Statistics ﬁnd application throughout data reduction, structure analy-
sis and the interpretation of results. The aim of this chapter is to outline
some basic statistical methods and concepts and to illustrate their impor-
tance in crystallography. This is an immense subject, and we shall not
deal, for instance, with intensity statistics, or the ways in which statistics
are used in direct methods. Particularly good references on the use of
statistics in the physical sciences have been written by Barlow (1997),
Hamilton (1964), and Bevington and Robinson (2003); these texts should
be consulted for more in-depth treatments.
If we measure some quantity experimentally (for example, a bond
length or a structure-factor amplitude), our observation will inevitably
suffer from some sort of error. Uncertainties or random errors are intro-
duced by random ﬂuctuations; these can be minimized, but never
eliminated, by careful experimental design. Systematic errors cause
measurements to deviate from their true values because of some phys-
ical effect (which we may or may not be aware of). As an example of
the contrast, consider the measurement of a distance by means of a
wooden metre rule. If the distance is measured by different people, or
repeatedly by one person, the separate measurements are likely to vary
somewhat; this variation constitutes a random error in the measure-
ment. If, however, the ﬁrst 2 cm of the metre rule have been sawn off
and this is not noticed, the measurements will be subject to a systematic
error affecting all of them equally. When measuring X-ray diffraction
intensities random errors might arise from the random ﬂuctuation of a
low-temperature device, or in the cooling cycle of a CCD chip, and sys-
tematic errors from the inﬂuences of absorption or crystal mis-centring.
Systematic errors may also be introduced into the results of a structure
determination by the models and methods used in structure determi-
nation (e.g. incorrect atomic scattering factors, inappropriate atomic
displacement parameters, wrong space group symmetry).
221

222
Random and systematic errors
At this stage we should also distinguish carefully between precision
and accuracy. The accuracy of an experiment is a measure of how close
the result is to its true value. The precision is a measure of the repro-
ducibility of a result and therefore of how conﬁdently the result can be
deﬁned. Truly random errors affect the precision but not the accuracy of
measurements and results. Depending on their exact nature, systematic
errors may or may not affect precision, but they do affect accuracy, and
so high precision is not of itself an indication of a ‘good’ result.
The precision of a measured quantity can be expressed by its standard
uncertainty, s.u. (also called its standard deviation or estimated standard
deviation, e.s.d.). In crystallography we quote the standard uncertainty
in parentheses, for example 1.520(4) Å for a bond length. The ﬁgure in
parentheses refers to the last quoted decimal place, and in this example
the standard uncertainty on our measurement of 1.520 Å is 0.004 Å; a
measurement of 1.52(4) Å is ten times less precise. Instead of 1.520(4) we
might have written 1.520 ± 0.004 Å, but this is an unfortunate notation
as it appears to specify a strict range for the bond length. While this
is what engineers do mean by this notation, the correct interpretation
in crystallography, and the physical sciences generally, is rather more
subtle.
Randomerrorscanbetreatedbystatisticalanalysisofhowtheseerrors
are distributed about zero, and this is why probability distributions have
assumed such importance in crystallography. Systematic errors can not
be treated by such a general theory, and each source of error must be
identiﬁed and its effect modelled by consideration of its physical nature.
16.2
Random errors and distributions
16.2.1
Measurement errors
The existence of random error means that whenever we make a
measurement of a quantity, x, what we actually measure is
xi = xtrue + εi,
where, in the absence of systematic errors, xtrue is the true, accurate,
value of x, and εi is a random measurement error. If we were to measure x
again, our measurement would be slightly different because the random
error εi would not be the same as when we made our ﬁrst measurement.
We can never know xtrue, but we can estimate its value, and obtain
some idea of the quality of our estimate. We do this by making multiple
measurements of x, and applying statistics.

A histogram illustrating these data is given in Fig. 16.1. Notice that,
although the range of F2 is 1684 to 1902, most measurements clump
together in the middle of the range, with relatively few at the extremes.
This is a description of the distribution of the data.
In some distributions the individual data can take only certain values:
forexample,thenumberofphotonscountedbyadetector,orthenumber
of people in a particular age group, must be integral. A case where the
values that can be taken by members of the distribution are only certain
discrete ones gives rise to a discrete distribution. By contrast, the data that
make up the elements of the distribution in Fig. 16.1 can adopt any value
(e.g. 1684.78 or 1787.27), and this yields a continuous distribution.

Random and systematic errors
If we measured all the xi that it is possible to measure, which may
mean making an inﬁnite number of measurements, then we could spec-
ify exactly the form of a distribution. This is called the parent distribution.
In general this is not possible, and the best we can do is to measure a
sample distribution.
The two most important quantities that characterize a distribution are
the mean x and the variance σ 2 (the square of the standard deviation). The
mean is what we loosely call the ‘average’ value of the variable, xi, taken
from N different measurements:
x = 1
N
N

i=1
xi.
(16.1)
The symbol μ is also often used for the mean, but it is best to distinguish
between μ for the true (unkown) mean of the complete parent distribu-
tion and x for the sample mean. In the distribution shown in Fig. 16.1 xi
are the individual values of F2, and N(= 67) is the number of reﬂections
in the data set. The variance of the sample distribution is deﬁned as
σ2 =
1
N −1
N

i=1
(xi −x)2,
(16.2)
and is a measure of the width or spread of the distribution over the
different values of x. The variance is the square of the standard deviation
σ, and σ is often called the sample standard deviation. Equations (16.1) and
(16.2) give our best estimates of the true mean and standard deviation
of a parent distribution based on data taken from a sample distribution.
The term N −1 appears in (16.2) because calculation of the mean
has removed one degree of freedom from the calculation. It is sometimes
replaced simply by N, though this is strictly correct only for com-
plete distributions and not for sample distributions; on calculators these
alternatives may be designated σN−1 and σN, respectively. Press et al.
(1991) say that if this distinction ever matters to you, then you are prob-
ably up to no good…trying to substantiate a questionable hypothesis with
marginal data.
All observations in a set of repeated measurements will contribute
equally to the mean and standard deviations given in (16.1) and (16.2).
However, it is often the case that individual observations will have some
measure of their precision; for example, values of σ(F2) are available
from counting statistics or proﬁle ﬁtting for each reﬂection in a dataset,
while a set of bond lengths to be averaged will also have a standard
uncertainty calculated after least-squares reﬁnement. In these cases it
may be appropriate to weight the calculation of the mean:
_x =
 wixi
 wi
.
(16.3)

16.2
Random errors and distributions
225
The standard deviation can be calculated using either:
σ2 =
N
 wi
,
(16.4)
or
σ2 =
N
N −1
 wi(xi −x)2
 wi
.
(16.5)
The ﬁrst is more common, but in the crystallographic intensity data-
merging program SORTAV, for example, where these quantities are
referred to as σ2
ext and σ2
int, both are calculated and the larger of the
two taken (Blessing, 1997). Choice of weights, wi, has become some-
thing of a subdiscipline of statistics (see Section 16.4), but a common
choice when averaging a set of measurements xi with precision σ(xi) is
to use wi = 1/σ2(xi).
Other quantities that may be quoted are the median, mode, skewness
and kurtosis (or curtosis) of the data. The median of a sample of data
values is the middle value of the data set when the values are placed in
ascending order. If the sample size is even, then the median is deﬁned as
being half-way between the two middle values. The median is impor-
tant because it is less sensitive to large outliers than the mean. As an
illustration, suppose the set of measurements was made for a particular
quantity: 0.9, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 10.0. The value 10.0 is obviously an outlier (a
mistake). The outlier strongly affects the value of the mean: 2.94 with
the outlier, 1.18 without. The median, by contrast is affected much less:
1.2 with the outlier, 1.15 without. This property is called robustness.

The mode is the most common value in a set of data, corresponding
to the maximum in a histogram. The sample skewness is a measure of
the symmetry of a distribution, and the kurtosis measures its peakiness.
Formulae are given in statistics text books [e.g. Barlow (1997), p.14].
Values of the mean, sample standard deviation, median, skewness and
kurtosisforthedatainFig.16.1aregiveninTable16.1.Thenegativeskew
means that the data tail off to the left; the kurtosis value is interpreted
below.
The mode, skewness and kurtosis seem to be encountered rather
rarely in crystallography. Indeed Barlow (1997) says: Kurtosis is not used
much by physicists, chemists, or indeed anyone else. It is a really obscure and
arcane quantity whose main use is inspiring awe in demonstrators, professors
or anyone else you are trying to impress.
16.2.3
Theoretical distributions
The shape of the histogram in Fig 16.1 can be described using a math-
ematical function called a probability distribution function, or pdf. There
are many such functions, some familiar ones being the binomial, Pois-
son, normal, and uniform distributions. By far the most important in

226
Random and systematic errors
crystallography (indeed in the physical sciences generally) is the normal
distribution, which is also called the Gaussian distribution.
The mathematical expression for this very important distribution is
P(x; μ, σ) =
1
σ
√
2π
exp

−(x −μ)2
2σ2

,
(16.6)
where μ and σ2 are the mean and variance, respectively. P(x; μ, σ2) is
the probability of measuring a particular value x given the mean and
variance. The distribution is said to be indexed on the mean and variance.
The distribution is symmetrical about its mean, and the function calcu-
lated with μ = 1809.9 and σ = 32.8 is superimposed on the histogram in
Fig. 16.1. The main characteristics of a normal distribution are shown in
Fig. 16.2. The values of the skew and kurtosis for a normal distribution
are both 0. The fact that the data in Fig. 16.1 have a positive kurtosis
(Table 16.1) means that the data are more sharply peaked than a normal
distribution: they are leptokurtic as opposed to platykurtic.
Equation (16.6) can be used to evaluate the probability of measuring
F2 to be 1801 (say): it is only 0.012. This seems odd at ﬁrst sight, since
from the appearance of the histogram 1801 looks quite likely. But it is
important to recall that we are dealing with a continuous distribution,
and it is more meaningful to evaluate the probability that x lies in a
speciﬁed range x1 to x2; this is
 x2
x1 P(x)dx. The probability of measuring
F2 between 1798 and 1804 is:

or 7% [if we measured 100 equivalents we would expect 7 of them to
lie between 1798 and 1804]. Statistics books (e.g. Barlow, 1997, p. 38)
tabulate integrals of the normal distribution within ±(x −μ)/σ from the
mean. 1801 is (1809.9 −1801)/32.8 = 0.27σ from the mean, and tables
give the probability of measuring a value within 0.27σ of the mean to
be 21.28%. 68.27% of the area under the curve lies between ±1σ, and
99.73% between ±3σ (this forms the basis for the ‘3σ rule’ for assessing
signiﬁcant differences, see Section 15.2.6). Note that the total probability
for all possible values of x is 1:

−∞
P(x)dx = 1.
(16.7)
The normal distribution is particularly important because of an effect
expressed by the Central Limit Theorem. Suppose we have a set of N
independent variables xi; each variable belongs to its own population
with mean μi and variance σ2
i . The function
y =

Figure 16.3 shows the central limit theorem in action: the top ﬁgure is a
histogram of 100 random numbers taken from a uniform distribution,
the lower ﬁgure is a histogram of the sum of 10 such sets of random
numbers.Although each of the 10 sets of random numbers has a uniform
distribution their sum has a normal distribution.
It is generally assumed that the experimental determination of the
value of a particular quantity is subject to a large number of independent
sources of small errors. All of these contributing errors are summed
to form the εi in some measured quantity. Because of the central limit
theorem, the εi values are normally distributed.

The mean of a distribution is the expectation value of x:

Another illustrative example of the use of expectation values is in

16.2.5
The standard error on the mean
Suppose we make N separate measurements of a quantity x. The mea-
sured values x1…xN are a sample from all the possible measurements
we could make, which follow some unknown distribution P(x). For suf-
ﬁciently large N, a consequence of the central limit theorem is that the
mean x of our N sample values is normally distributed with the same
mean μ as the parent population (all possible measurements) and with
variance
σ2(x) = σ2
N .
(16.12)
By ‘variance of the mean x’ we understand the variance we would obtain
by taking many such samples, calculating the mean x for each separate
sample, and then looking at the distribution (mean and variance) of
these individual sample means. The factor N in (16.12) means that the
standard error on the mean can become very small for large numbers of
observations, and it is extremely important to question the validity of the
assumption that the data are drawn from the same parent distribution.
16.3
Taking averages
The mean and standard deviation can always be calculated from a set of
numbers, such as a set of bond distances, and it is very tempting to do

this. Two questions arise: (i) is it better to use (16.1) or (16.3) to calculate
the mean, and (ii) is such an average meaningful?
Taylor and Kennard (1983) showed that a weighted mean (16.3) is
appropriate if the variation in the values to be averaged is mainly due
to experimental random errors, so that the observed values are nor-
mally distributed about their mean. They illustrated their analysis using
twelve C=N bond distances taken from a number of different crystal
structures of adenine derivatives. The distance data were as listed in
Table 16.2.
The weighted mean calculated using (16.3), (16.4) and (16.12) and
wi = 1/σ2(xi) is 1.314(2) Å. In order to assess whether this is valid we
need to test for normality in the bond-distance data in Table 16.2.

Testing for normality using a histogram
One obvious test for normality is to plot the data and see if the resulting
histogram looks like a normal distribution. Figure 16.4 shows this for
the data in Table 16.2.
There are only 12 data here, but the histogram is highest in the middle
and there is only one maximum, which is what we would expect for
normally distributed data. A more quantitative test is described below.
Often, histograms can be multimodal (i.e. have two or more maxima):
in such cases it is meaningless to calculate an average.An extreme exam-
ple is shown in Fig. 16.5, a histogram of all the CN distances in organic
molecules in the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen, 2002). We could
calculate the average of these data to be 1.3967 Å, with a standard error
on the mean of 0.0002 Å. This appears very precise because there are a
lot of CN distances in the CSD (212 914), and so a large number goes
into the denominator of (16.12). This is utterly meaningless because the

calized bonds. It is as though we had an apple and a banana and tried to
determine the average fruit. Just because we can do a calculation does
not guarantee that the result is meaningful.
16.3.2
The χ2 test for normality
A more quantitative test for normality is to calculate the value of χ2:
χ2 =

wi(xi −
_x)2,
(16.13)
where wi are the weights used to calculate the weighted mean.
The expectation value of χ2 is N −P where N is the number of obser-
vations and P is the number of parameters that needed to be determined
from the set of numbers before χ2 could be calculated. N −P is referred
to as the number of degrees of freedom, and in the case of determining a
mean, only one parameter, the mean, has had to be determined, so P = 1.
It is convenient to deﬁne a reduced χ2
χ2
red =
χ2
N −P,
(16.14)
which has an expectation value of 1.
For Taylor and Kennard’s data the value of χ2 is 11.66, and the number
of degrees of freedom 12 −1 = 11, therefore χ2
red = 1.06. The fact that
this is near 1 means that we can conclude that the errors in the data are
normally distributed. In fact we can assign a probability to the previous
statement, and this is discussed in specialist text books on statistics (e.g.
Barlow, 1997; page 150).
The normality of a distribution can also be tested with a normal
probability plot, and this is discussed below in Section 16.4.3.

Random and systematic errors
16.3.3
Averaging data when χ2
red ≫1
When the variation in a sample is mainly due to environmental effects,
such as crystal-packing effects on bond distances, the mean should be
calculated using (16.1). The standard deviation, σ(sample), should be
calculated using (16.2), i.e. the sample standard deviation should be
quoted, not the standard deviation on the mean. Taylor and Kennard
(1983) argue that, if each measurement has its own standard deviation,
it is better to estimate the standard deviation using
σ2 = σ2(sample) −
_______
σ2(xi),
(16.15)
though the second term (the average variance of the measurements) is
usually so much smaller than the ﬁrst that it makes little difference.
The C=N bond distances in adenine derivatives, for example, appear
to be rather insensitive to crystal-packing forces, and this may be
described as a ‘hard’ geometrical parameter. Other parameters, such as
metal–metal bond lengths in clusters, bond angles, torsion angles, and
intermolecular contact distances, are much more variable and subject to
environmental effects. Such parameters may be described as ‘soft’. It is
important to remember that an average value is meaningless for a set
of parameters that are not really equivalent (i.e. they do not belong to
the same normal distribution). Even for bonds that appear to be chemi-
cally similar, statistical equivalence may not be found. In such cases, it
is better to quote a range of values, but if you feel driven to calculate
an average anyway, use (16.1) for the mean, and σ (sample) (16.2) for its
standard deviation.
16.4
Weighting schemes
Weighting schemes occur throughout crystallographic calculations,
such as merging of data, least-squares reﬁnement, and analysis of
results. In the following section we will discuss the use of weighting
schemes in reﬁnement.
It may seem odd to start discussing least-squares reﬁnement in a
chapter on statistics and errors. However, least squares is one form of
estimation, a technical term used in statistics to refer to the derivation of
numerical quantites from a sample set of data. The mean and standard
deviation are two estimators, and when, for example, intensity data are
merged using (16.3), we are deriving an estimate (using the word in its
technical sense) of the intensity of a reﬂection given a sample set of data.
Least squares is the most important estimation procedure in physical
science. Inleastsquareswe estimate numericalvaluesofparametersfrom
a dataset, including co-ordinates, displacement parameters, standard
uncertainties etc.). We minimize a quantity
χ2 =

wi(Yo −Yc)2 =

w2,
(16.16)

16.4
Weighting schemes
233
where Y = F2 or F. Comparison of (16.16) with (16.13) should convince
you of the link that exists between reﬁnement and statistics.
We have already seen that it is important to be sure that data belong
to the same parent distribution before averaging them and calculating
a standard error on the mean. It can also be shown that use of least-
squares formulae implicitly assumes that the measurement errors in Yo
are normally distributed (compare (16.16) with the exponent in (16.6)).
This is a fair assumption, because intensity measurements are subject
to many small sources of error, and so the central limit theorem will
make overall errors follow a normal distribution, as required. However,
the central limit theorem works better at the centre of a distribution
than in the tails, and it is common in real datasets to ﬁnd data further
away from the mean than would be expected if real measurement errors
were truly normally distributed. This means that although the wi are
conventionally chosen to be 1/σ2(Yi) in data merging and reﬁnement,
the σ2(Yi) may not in fact be the best estimates for the errors in our
measurements.

Weights used in least-squares reﬁnement with
single-crystal diffraction data
Figure 16.6 shows a histogram of values of (F2
o −F2
c)/σ(F2
o) calculated
after reﬁnement of the crystal structure of serine hydrate. According to
the theory of the normal distribution, if our σs really are a good estimate
of our measurement errors, there should be essentially no data with
|(F2
o−F2
c)/σ(F2
o)| > 3, but in fact there are lots, including some enormous
outliers.

Random and systematic errors
after merging. Conventional crystallographic models are also incapable
of fully reproducing observed diffraction patterns because of the use
of spherical atom scattering factors and harmonic approximations for
thermal motion (see Section 16.7). If our measurement errors were really
normal we could just weight on σ2(Yi). Since they are not, to put no ﬁner
point on it, we ﬁddle the σs!
One way to modify the σs is to recognize that the biggest errors (extinc-
tion and absorption) are associated with the strong data, and to increase
the σ2(F2
i ) according to
σ2(F2) + aF2
o,
(16.17)
where a is chosen in such a way as to produce a more satisfactory plot
than that shown in Fig. 16.6 (a is often between 0.1 and 0.01). Crystal-
lographers used to do this until Wilson (1976) showed that using Fo
like this induced bias in the reﬁned parameters. Use of Fc instead also
induced bias but only about half as much and in the opposite sense. To
take account of this, σ2(F2
i ) is changed to σ2(F2) + a(F2
o + 2F2
c)/3. This is
the basis of the weighting scheme devised by Sheldrick (2008) for use
in SHELXL:
wi =
1
σ2(F2o) + (aP)2 + bP,
(16.18)
where P = (F2
o+2F2
c)/3 and a and b are chosen to make χ2
red constant over
bins of data grouped according to intensity or resolution (a so-called ﬂat
analysis of variance; see Section 16.4.3).
A completely different approach (Carruthers and Watkin, 1979) is to
throw away the σs altogether, and to ﬁt a graph of (Yo −Yc)2 versus
Y2
c to some function. The inverted function then becomes the weighting
scheme, so guaranteeing a ﬂat analysis of variance.
16.4.2
Robust-resistant weighting schemes
and outliers
Although most data in a set of measurements usually have errors that
follow a normal distribution, some data will be poorly measured, and
should be thrown away. Such data appear on their own well away from
the centre of a distribution, and they are referred to as outliers. An exam-
ple of such an outlier is the intensity measurement of 1684 in Fig. 16.1.
We saw above that aberrant data points can affect the value mean.
They can also seriously affect parameter estimates in least-squares
reﬁnement. The mean and least-squares calculations are said not to be
robust, and it is important therefore to remove outliers from crystallo-
graphic procedures such as merging and reﬁnement.
One method for identifying outliers is by application of Chauvenet’s
criterion (Bevington and Robinson, 2003), which states that, provided
the data follow a normal distribution, we should eliminate a data point
if we expect less than half an event to be further from the mean than the

this is ≪0.5 we should delete this point.
An alternative, more ﬂexible, procedure that can also account for the
long tails in experimentally derived distributions is to down-weight
data by multiplying conventionally derived weights by a modiﬁer func-
tion. A frequently used choice is the robust-resistant or Tukey scheme
(Prince, 1994; Price and Nicolson, 1983; Press et al., 1992):
w′ = wi

(16.20)
if zi < 6, and w′ = 0 otherwise. Table 16.3 (Blessing, 1997) compares the
weights that would be obtained for normal and robust-resistant schemes
and it can be seen how the robust-resistant scheme can accommodate the
long tails of experimentally observed distributions (compare the values
in Table 16.3 for a point 4σ from the mean), but also identify serious
outliers.
16.4.3
Assessing weighting schemes
The most widely used test to determine whether weights are on the cor-
rect scale is the χ2 test described above. In crystallographic reﬁnements
we tend to calculate the value of S =

χ2
red, the goodness of ﬁt, instead.

236
Random and systematic errors
A value near 1.0 implies that the weights are on the correct scale. In
practice, the value of S can be manipulated to be near unity by dividing
all the wi by χ2
red, and so, unless the σs derived from data process-
ing are being used without modiﬁcation in the weighting scheme, this
parameter has little value.
A more useful procedure, also mentioned above, is to examine how
the values of w2 vary when the data are arranged in some systematic
way, and this is referred to as an analysis of variance. In the merging pro-
cedure in SORTAV (Blessing, 1997) this analysis is based on resolution
and intensity to derive more realistic estimates of the standard devia-
tions of the merged intensities. In structure reﬁnement, when S or χ2
red is
plotted against F2
c, or sin θ/λ, or index, the line should be ﬂat (Fig. 16.7).
Trends in the values of residuals across different groups (especially
different ranges of resolution and of structure-factor amplitude) reveal
the presence of systematic errors in the model (e.g. neglect of hydrogen
atoms or of extinction effects) or imperfections in the weighting scheme.
Indeed, empirical adjustments to the weighting scheme can be made on
the basis of such an analysis; the weights thus obtained are supposed to
reﬂect not only uncertainties in the data, but also shortcomings of the
structural model.

Weighting schemes
237
Another method of assessing the validity of a weighting scheme is
through a normal probability plot (Abrahams and Keve, 1971). The ﬁrst
stage of this analysis is to order the j observations in terms of w
1/2. If
the errors in the data follow a normal distribution (and we hope that
this is being reﬂected in our weighting scheme), then the ith data point
should have a w
1/2 value of z, where z is given by the equation

(16.21)
The values of z and w
1/2 can be plotted against each other (usually with
the ideal z values on the x-axis), with +z for i > j/2 and −z for i < j/2.
For example, after ordering 192 w
1/2-values, the 37th had a value of
w
1/2 = −0.95. 192 −74 + 1/192 = 0.62, and consulting a table of the
integral of a normal distribution (e.g. on p. 38 in Barlow), gives z for
this to be 0.88. The value to be used in the normal probability analysis
is −0.88 since 37 < 192/2, and so the point to be plotted is (−0.88,
−0.95). In practice, of course, these calculations are accomplished using
computer programs: such a facility exists in some reﬁnement programs
(e.g.CRYSTALS)andstatisticspackagessuchasMINITABhavefacilities
for calculating so-called normal scores.

the model; a gradient of less than 1.0 would indicate that the weights are
too small (or the σs are too large if these are being used in the weighting
scheme). If the intercept of the plot is not zero, this may indicate a scaling
problem.
Such plots are useful, not only in assessing weighting schemes and
the agreement between observed and calculated set of data, but in any
comparison of two sets of quantities (e.g. two independently measured
datasets for the same structure, or two sets of parameters reﬁned from
them). For the comparison of two independent sets of measured data,
for example, we would use
δi =
F1,i −F2,i
$
σ2(F1,i) + σ2(F2,i)
,
(16.22)
and then sort the deviations δi into order of increasing value from the
most negative to the most positive. Probability plots can also be adapted
for testing any probability distribution function.

Analysis of the agreement between
observed and calculated data
16.5.1
R factors
Before we are able to calculate the desired geometrical information from
the reﬁned atomic parameters, reﬁnement must reach convergence. But
is this convergence the best that can be achieved for our structure? At
several stages during a typical structure determination, reﬁnement con-
verges, but the introduction of more parameters (a change in the model
being reﬁned) allows further reﬁnement to take place, giving conver-
gence again, this time (we hope) to an even better agreement with the
observed data. Such developments of the model are, for example, the
replacement of isotropic by anisotropic atomic displacement parame-
ters, and the inclusion of hydrogen atoms. Other changes that can be
made are the reﬁnement of parameters for effects such as extinction
or absorption, the addition of models of disorder, and changes to the
weighting scheme. Any change in the model will produce a different
set of reﬁned parameters. How do we assess the agreement with the
observed data and choose the ‘best’ model?
Overall ‘residuals’ (single-value measures of the agreement) com-
monly used and quoted are:

R is long established as the traditional ‘R factor’, accorded a general
reverence far in excess of its real signiﬁcance. The ‘generalized R factor’,

16.6
Analysis of the agreement between observed and calculated data

called wR here in accordance with current Acta Crystallographica usage,
is variously referred to as RG, R′ and Rw as well.
All of these residuals can be manipulated and massaged in various
ways to produce an apparently better ﬁt to the data. Both R and wR
can be reduced dramatically by omitting some reﬂections, especially
the weak ones and a few that give particularly poor agreement between
|Fo| and |Fc| (perhaps on grounds such as ‘they are strongly affected
by extinction’). A much better assessment of the ﬁt of observed and
calculated data comes from an analysis of variance or normal probability
plots as described above.
16.5.2
Signiﬁcance testing
Increasing the number of reﬁned parameters will always (given suitable
weights) reduce the residuals and produce a better ﬁt to the observed
data. It does not follow that any such reduction is signiﬁcant and
meaningful.
The standard test for assessing statistically the improvement in ﬁt
when the model is changed is by analysis of χ2 values from the different
models. Ratios of pairs of χ2 values follow a so-called F-distribution, but
Hamilton (1971) adapted this for ratios of the wR residuals:
ℜ= wR(1)
wR(2)
(16.24)
for comparison with tabulated values. The tables are constructed for dif-
ferent ‘dimensions’ (the difference in number of parameters for models
1 and 2) and ‘degrees of freedom’ (N −P for model 2) and according to
various ‘levels of signiﬁcance’ α. Thus, if the value of ℜis greater than a
tabulated value appropriate to the degrees of freedom and dimension of
the test, this means that the probability that this apparent improvement
couldarisebychancefromtwoequallygoodmodelsislessthanα;model
2 is said to be better than model 1 at the α signiﬁcance level (α is often
expressed as a percentage). So a signiﬁcance level of α = 0.01 (1%), for
example, indicates that there is a 1% risk of accepting the second model
as better when it actually is not.
Interpolation is often necessary between tabulated values, because
the available tables do not cover exactly the dimension and degrees of
freedom required. In practice, it is rare for these tests to indicate that
improvement is not signiﬁcant, and there are some doubts as to their
true statistical validity.
Note that the s.u.s of the reﬁned parameters do not necessarily
decrease when the residuals decrease. Although they do depend on the
minimization function 
i wi2
i , they also depend inversely on the excess
of data to parameters, N −P. A very simple assessment of the signiﬁ-
cance of the improvement of a model on introducing extra parameters
is, then, to see whether the parameter s.u. values are reduced.

16.6
Estimated standard deviations and
standard uncertainties of structural
parameters
In crystal-structure determinations we do not usually determine a
structure several times in order to obtain mean values of the atomic
parameters and estimates of the variance of these parameters. Instead
we obtain ‘estimated standard deviations’ (e.s.d.s or s.u.s) from a single
experiment. This is possible because our experimentally measured data
(diffraction intensities) greatly outnumber the parameters to be derived:
the problem is said to be over-determined. The value obtained for the
parameter is our best estimate of the true value. The s.u. is a measure of
the precision or statistical reliability of this value; it is our best estimate
of the variation we would expect to ﬁnd for this parameter if we were
to repeat the whole experiment many times. The s.u. we obtain from
reﬁnement is analogous to the standard error on the mean deﬁned in
(16.12).
In structure reﬁnement by least squares, a number of parameters
are determined from a larger number of observed data. The quantity
minimized is

eters (such as calculating a bond length from the six co-ordinates of
two atoms), it is important to recognize this interrelationship in order
to calculate the correct s.u.s for the secondary results.
When variables are not statistically independent, they are said to
be correlated. Just as individual variables have variances, so correlated

variables have covariances. For a discrete distribution of two correlated
variables x and y, the covariance is deﬁned as
cov(x, y) =
1
N −1
N

i=1
(xi −x)(yi −y),
(16.27)
which should be compared with the variances
σ2(x) =
1
N −1
N

i=1
(xi −x)2
and
σ2(y) =
1
N −1
N

i=1
(yi −y)2,
(16.28)
thus, cov(x, x) = σ2(x) by deﬁnition. For a continuous distribution,
similarly
cov(x, y) =
b
a
d
c
(x −x)(y −y)P(x, y)dxdy
b
a
d
c
P(x, y)dxdy,
(16.29)
where c and d are the lower and upper limits of the variable y.
In both cases, the correlation coefﬁcient of x and y is
r(x, y) = cov(x, y)
σ(x)σ(y) ,
(16.30)
and this must lie in the range ±1. A correlation coefﬁcient of exactly
+1 or −1 means that x and y are perfectly correlated – each is an exact
linear function of the other, and only one variable is actually required to
describe them both. If x and y are completely independent, their covari-
ance and correlation coefﬁcient are both zero, though the converse is not
necessarilytrue(acovarianceofzerodoesnothavetomeanindependent
variables).
Covariances (and hence correlation coefﬁcients) of all pairs of reﬁned
parameters for a crystal structure are obtained together with the
variances from the inverse matrix:
cov(pj, pk) = (A−1)jk
N
i=1 wi2

.
(16.31)
Once we have all the variances and covariances of a set of quantities
(such as the reﬁned atomic parameters), we can calculate the variances
and covariances of any functions of these quantities (such as molecular
geometry parameters).

and thus, the variance of f is just a weighted sum of the variances of the
individual independent variables.
The full variance–covariance matrix following the ﬁnal least-squares
reﬁnement must, therefore, be used in calculating molecular geometry
s.u. values. Calculation using the co-ordinate s.u. values alone, with
neglect of correlation effects between atoms, does not give the correct
geometry s.u.s: it is equivalent to using (16.34) instead of (16.32), and
potentially important terms are missing. This is particularly evident
when calculating the bond length between two atoms related by a sym-
metry element, because the co-ordinates of these atoms are completely
correlated.
Such calculations are normally performed automatically together
with the least-squares reﬁnement. Proper calculation in a separate
step later would require that the reﬁnement program output the full
variance–covariance matrix.
16.7
Systematic errors
The preceding sections have largely discussed the effects of random
errors in a data set. Systematic errors usually lead to a reduction in
both precision and accuracy in a structure determination if they are not
corrected.

16.7
Systematic errors
243
16.7.1
Systematic errors in the data
(a) Absorption
Absorption reduces the observed intensities of diffraction, but by dif-
ferent factors for different reﬂections. The effect is greatest at low Bragg
angle, so that there is a systematic error even for a spherical crystal.
Uncorrected signiﬁcant absorption causes atomic displacement param-
eters to be too low, in an attempt to compensate for the effect.Anisotropic
absorption (for a non-spherical crystal) affects the apparent atomic
vibration differently in different directions, so that elongated ‘thermal
ellipsoids’ are produced for the atoms in a needle crystal. The atomic
co-ordinates are generally not signiﬁcantly affected, but the s.u.s are
increased because the observed and calculated data do not agree so
well; the atomic displacement parameters can not completely mop up
the absorption errors.
(b) Extinction
This also attenuates the observed intensities, and it is most severe for
low-angle, strong reﬂections. Like absorption, it reduces overall preci-
sion and systematically affects atomic displacement parameters, while
having much less effect on atomic co-ordinate values.
(c) Thermal diffuse scattering
TDS, produced as a result of co-operative lattice vibrations, has the
effect of increasing observed intensities. The effect, however, increases
with sin2 θ, so the net effect, if no correction is made, is once again
to reduce atomic displacement parameters from their true values. TDS
effects have received little attention in routine crystal-structure deter-
mination, and they are generally believed to be small. Data collection at
reduced temperature is an advantage here, as well as in other ways.
(d) A poorly aligned diffractometer
Several errors can be introduced into the diffraction data by this fault,
including an improper measurement of intensities if the reﬂections are
not completely received by the counter aperture. The most common
error, however, is probably in unit cell parameters. If a badly aligned
instrument involves systematic errors in the zero points of the circles
(especially 2θ), there will be a corresponding error in reﬁned cell param-
eters, which may well be much greater than their supposed s.u.s. This, in
turn, leads to systematic errors in molecular geometry, and no indication
of these can be seen in the commonly quoted measures of the ‘quality’
of the structure determination (structure factor residuals, goodness of
ﬁt, etc.), which refer only to diffraction intensities and not to diffraction
geometry. Such errors as this, therefore, are the most invidious, because
it is difﬁcult to detect them.
(e) Anomalous dispersion
This may be considered as a systematic effect (and, hence, a potential
source of systematic error) in the data, or as a possible fault in the struc-
tural model if properly corrected atomic scattering factors are not used.

244
Random and systematic errors
Neglectofthecorrectioninanon-centrosymmetricstructurewithapolar
axis or, even worse, a ‘correction’ with the wrong sign, results in a sys-
tematic shift, along the polar axis, of all atoms displaying signiﬁcant
anomalous scattering effects, because this shift, relative to the rest of the
atoms, mimics the phase shift produced by the anomalous scattering
(Cruickshank and McDonald, 1967). In a centrosymmetric or a non-
polar non-centrosymmetric structure, atomic positions are not affected,
but atomic displacement parameters are.
Of course, anomalous dispersion effects can be used for determin-
ing the correct ‘handedness’ of a non-centrosymmetric structure (see
Chapter 18 on twinning), and also for determining phases of reﬂec-
tions in structure solution, but these are really separate subjects and not
directly concerned with errors and results.
16.7.2
Data thresholds
It is fairly common for the weakest reﬂections not to be used in least-
squares reﬁnement, though there is considerable controversy over this.
The inclusion or omission of weak reﬂections usually makes no signif-
icant difference to the derived parameter values. Weak reﬂections tend
to increase the residuals R and (to a lesser extent if they are correctly
weighted) wR, but this is compensated somewhat by the larger excess
of data over parameters (N −P), so it is not clear how ﬁnal s.u.s will
be affected. In fact, it has been demonstrated that they, too, are scarcely
alteredbytheinclusionoromissionofweakreﬂectionsorbythedecision
of just where to set the threshold (Stenkamp and Jensen, 1975). Thus,
the difference in the results is to a large degree just a cosmetic one. On
the other hand, the weak reﬂections can play a crucial role in decid-
ing between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric space groups
in ambiguous cases, because their omission tends to bias statistical tests
towards a decision against centrosymmetry. If no sigma cut-off is to be
used during reﬁnement, it is essential to examine critically the resolu-
tion at which the data vanish into the background. In general, there
seems to be little to recommend the exclusion of weak data in resolution
shells where there are plenty of strong data – their weakness conveys
important information. The inclusion of swathes of weak high-angle
data just because the data reduction software has written them to a ﬁle
only degrades the quality of a structure determination.
16.7.3
Errors and limitations of the model
The parameters reﬁned by least squares are an attempt to describe the
structure we are trying to determine. They represent an approximation
to the actual X-ray scattering power of the structure. No such model
can be a perfect representation, and there are various limitations on the
simple models we use, and various errors that may be made in choosing
the elements of the model.

16.7
Systematic errors
245
(a) Atomic scattering factors
The tabulated scattering factors commonly used are reasonably accurate
representations of the scattering power of individual, isolated atoms at
rest. They have spherical symmetry, and probably their greatest limi-
tation is the lack of allowance for distortion of this spherical electron
density when atoms are placed together and bonded to each other. The
greatest effects of this approximation are seen in the low-angle data,
and an analysis of variance of the observed and calculated data after
reﬁnement commonly shows the worst agreements for such reﬂections.
In careful work, some of the largest peaks in a ﬁnal-difference electron-
density synthesis are found between atoms (bonding electron density)
and in regions where lone pairs of non-bonding electrons are expected
to lie. This is, of course, one reason why bonds to hydrogen atoms are
found to be systematically shortened in X-ray diffraction studies.
An incorrect assignment of atom types, so that a wrong scattering fac-
tor is used for an atom, scarcely affects atomic co-ordinates in most cases,
although there are circumstances under which these may be subject to
a systematic error. In an attempt to compensate for the wrong scatter-
ing factor, reﬁnement will adjust the atomic displacement parameters,
often to a very considerable degree; an incorrectly assigned atom may
be recognized in many cases by its anomalous displacement parameter,
especially at the early isotropic stage of reﬁnement when there is a single
parameter for each atom.
(b) Constraints and restraints
Properly used, these are valuable tools in reﬁnement, allowing us to
deal with problems of parameters that are not well determined from the
diffraction data alone. We must, however, be quite sure of the validity
of any constraints or restraints we apply. Any that strongly oppose the
course of unconstrained/unrestrained reﬁnement, rather than gently
guiding it, prevent convergence to the data-determined minimum and
so force a different result. This will, in particular, signiﬁcantly affect the
geometry around the regions in the structure where the constraints are
being applied.
A common example is the use of a constrained C–H bond length of
1.08 Å, chosen because it is the ‘true’ value determined spectroscopically
for simple hydrocarbons. Since C–H bonds are systematically shortened
in X-ray work, the effect of the constraint will be to push both atoms
further apart than the diffraction data alone would indicate. Although
the hydrogen-atom position will be most affected, there will be a small,
but possibly signiﬁcant, effect on the carbon atom. Misplacing the atoms
in this way will also affect their displacement parameters.
Other cases of inappropriate constraints include the imposition of too
high a symmetry on a group of atoms that is genuinely perturbed to a
less regular shape by bonding or packing interactions. Phenyl groups
are systematically distorted from regular hexagonal symmetry, and the
use of such a simple model, frequently used in reﬁnement, may not be
appropriate.

246
Random and systematic errors
(c) Incorrect symmetry
Space group determination is based on several experimental measure-
ments and deductions: (i) the metric symmetry of the reciprocal and
direct lattices; (ii) the Laue symmetry of the observed diffraction pat-
tern; (iii) systematically absent reﬂections; (iv) statistical tests for the
presence or absence of symmetry elements, especially an inversion cen-
tre; (v) ultimately, a ‘successful’ reﬁnement. Reports appear relatively
frequently in the literature of space groups that are reputed to have been
incorrectly assigned by previous workers. In many cases, the problem
is not a serious one, in that two molecules, actually equivalent by unno-
ticed symmetry, are reﬁned as independent, and their geometries are
not signiﬁcantly different: the results are reliable, but contain unneces-
sary redundancies. Where the missing symmetry is an inversion centre,
however, there is a real problem, in that reﬁnement is unstable (strictly
speaking, the matrix is singular), but this may be masked by the par-
ticular reﬁnement technique used. The geometrical results in this case
are quite unreliable: parameters that should be equal by symmetry may
be found to differ by a large amount, and the molecular geometry often
displays considerable distortions.
(d) High thermal motion and static disorder
It is not always easy to distinguish these two situations, except by car-
rying out the data collection at a reduced temperature (which reduces
dynamic disorder but not usually static disorder unless there is actu-
ally an order-disorder phase transition at an intermediate temperature).
High thermal motion increases the foreshortening of interatomic dis-
tances generally observed in X-ray diffraction, so there is a considerable
systematic error in bond lengths, which was discussed in Chapter 14.
The usual six-parameter (ellipsoidal) model of thermal motion becomes
increasingly inadequate as the motion increases in amplitude, so the
displacement parameters are of dubious value and their precision is
generally poor.
The presence of disorder in a structure, unless it is very simple and
can be well modelled, reduces to some extent the overall precision of
the whole structure, not just of the particular atoms affected. For this
reason, certain atomic groupings notorious for disorder are best avoided
if possible: these include ClO−
4 , BF−
4 and PF−
6 anions.
High thermal motion and/or disorder can make the geometrical inter-
pretation of a structure difﬁcult, and may lead to incorrect deductions
about the molecular geometry and conformation. A classic case is that
of ferrocene, (C5H5)2Fe, which appears to be staggered because of unre-
solved disorder at room temperature, but that (contrary to statements
in some standard inorganic chemistry text-books!) is actually eclipsed.
(e) Wrong structures
Such errors as those just mentioned, with an incorrect molecular geom-
etry, are bad enough, but it is possible, though very uncommon and
unlikely, to ﬁnd a completely incorrect structure, in the sense of identi-
fying the wrong chemical compound.Acase of mistaken identity caused

by 30-fold disorder involves the supposed structure of dodecahedrane
(Ermer, 1983). Wrongly assigned atom types were suspected in the struc-
ture of ‘[ClF6][CuF4]’, which in reality is probably [Cu(H2O)4][SiF6]
(von Schnering and Vu, 1983); the original workers were misled by the
similarity in scattering powers of Si and Cl, and of O and F, and perhaps
by some wishful thinking!
16.7.4
Assessment of a structure determination
The above discussion should encourage us to take a critical view of
crystal-structure determination in general (Jones, 1984; Ibers, 1974), and
to seek to evaluate carefully any particular reported structure. Several
research journals issue detailed instructions for authors of crystal-
structure reports, and some provide separate checklists for referees.
These can provide a useful framework for assessing a structure, whether
it be one reported in the literature, or one of your own.
Below is a summary of some useful points for checking the quality
of a structure determination. It is derived from a number of sources,
including standard tests applied by Acta Crystallographica Sections B/C/E,
and a list distributed by David Watkin at a British Crystallographic
Association Intensive School.
Check for consistency of the crystal data. If you have a suitable com-
puter program, you can input the cell parameters and chemical formula
and check the volume, Z (number of chemical formula units in the unit
cell), density, absorption coefﬁcient μ, etc. For a quick check by hand
calculation:
(a) count the non-hydrogen atoms (N) in the molecule or formula
unit;
(b) check that abc sin δ ≈V, where δ is the most removed of α, β, γ
from 90◦;
(c) calculate the average volume per non-H atom (= V/NZ), which
is usually about 18 Å3 for organic and many other compounds.
Assess the description of the data collection.
(a) Check that |h|max/a ≈|k|max/b ≈|l|max/c, and that at least the
correct minimum fraction of reciprocal space has been covered.
(b) 2θmax should be at least 45◦(better, 50◦) for Mo radiation, 110◦
(better, 130◦) for Cu radiation.
(c) Look at the number of unique data, the number of ‘observed’ data,
and the threshhold [which may be expressed in terms of σ(I) or
σ(F): I ≥2σ(I) corresponds to F ≥4σ(F)]; check for a low value
of Rint if equivalent reﬂections are merged.
(d) Calculate and compare μtmin and μtmax (dimensionless!) for
the minimum and maximum crystal dimensions. If μtmax < 2,
absorption is probably no problem. If μtmax > 5 or (μtmax −
μtmin) > 2, an absorption correction is necessary (or there will
be signiﬁcant effects on the Uij values). More detailed tests

248
Random and systematic errors
are described in the Notes for Authors of Acta Crystallographica
Section C.
Assess the reﬁnement and results.
(a) The number of observed data should be greater than the num-
ber of reﬁned parameters by a factor of at least 5 (and preferably
10).Anisotropic reﬁnement gives 9 parameters per atom, isotropic
gives 4. Constrained H atoms do not count unless U is reﬁned for
them.
(b) Examine carefully the description of any constraints/restraints,
the treatment of H atoms, and any disorder.
(c) Look for strange U or Uij values; high values may indicate dis-
order, low values may indicate uncorrected absorption (unless
low temperature was used); either of these could be due to
misassigned atom types.
(d) Check for convergence (shift/s.u. values preferably < 0.01).
(e) Examine the ﬁt of observed and calculated data, if possible, not
only by the value of R.
(f) Difference electron density outside about ±1 eÅ−3 may be due
to missing, misplaced, or misassigned atoms, systematic errors
such as absorption (especially if large peaks appear close to heavy
atoms), or unmodelled disorder.
(g) Check for ‘absolute structure’ determination if the space group
does not have a centre of symmetry.
(h) Assess the s.u.s (i) of the reﬁned parameters; (ii) of the molec-
ular geometry parameters. Watch out for low s.u.s ignoring cell
parameter uncertainties. Check for s.u.s on values that should be
constrained, symmetry-equivalent, etc.
(i) Check for strange results: unusual geometry, impossibly short
intermolecular contacts, etc.
Many of these tests have been incorporated into the CHECKCIF proce-
dure in PLATON (Spek, 2003), and all structures should be validated with
this program as a matter of routine.

Powder diffraction

17.1
Introduction to powder diffraction
X-ray and neutron powder diffraction are extremely powerful tools for
probing the structural chemistry of materials in the solid state. Both
techniques can be used to gain information about the composition of a
bulk material, the degree of crystallinity of its components, information
about its unit cell size and symmetry and, in favourable cases, full 3-
dimensional structural information comparable to that obtained from
single-crystal methods. Powder diffraction experiments can be readily
performed under the inﬂuence of external factors such as temperature,
pressure or applied magnetic ﬁeld, under laser illumination of a sample,
and even as a function of time or chemical environment during the
synthesis of materials, giving valuable kinetic and mechanistic insight
into their formation.
The primary focus of this book and the BCA crystallography school
on which it is based is on single-crystal methods as applied to ‘small
molecules’. There is no doubt that if one’s primary goal is the elucidation
of high-quality structural data, single-crystal diffraction will always be
themethod of choice. Nevertheless,theopportunitiesofferedbypowder
diffraction methods should not be forgotten. In many cases single crys-
tals of interesting materials of sufﬁcient size/quality for single-crystal
methods simply can not be prepared (though increasingly small micro-
crystals can now be studied at a synchrotron source; see Chapter 22).
This is particularly true for the extended materials discussed in Chapter
14, where low solubility, phase transitions leading to multiple twinning,
or the speciﬁc synthetic conditions required make single crystals hard or
impossible to obtain. For many categories of technologically exploited
materials (zeolites, high-Tc superconductors, structural materials, mag-
netic materials, conducting oxides, multiferroics, ionically conducting
polymers, etc.) the key structural insights came from powder diffraction
studies since single crystals were not available.
In other applications powder diffraction may provide complementary
information (such as bulk sample composition) to single-crystal tech-
niques. Non-ambient studies (under extremes of temperature, pressure,
magnetic ﬁeld or optical irradiation) are often simpler to perform on
powdered samples than single crystals, allowing the potential to study
functional materials under ‘real’ operating conditions; powder studies
251

252
Powder diffraction
become essential when phenomena such as phase transitions cause sin-
gle crystals to shatter under working conditions. Recent advances in the
speed of powder diffraction studies (whole patterns being collected in
a matter of minutes, seconds or less) using advanced sources/detectors
mean that phenomena such as host-guest inclusion reactions, chemical
transformations in the solid state and crystallization can now be fol-
lowed in real time, allowing valuable kinetic and mechanistic insight
into the process of chemical transformations (Evans and Evans, 2004).
Despite powder diffraction being seen as a ‘poor cousin’ to single-crystal
techniques by many, it is a key member of the family of analyti-
cal methods that can be brought to bear on understanding structural
problems. This chapter highlights areas of potential interest to the small-

17.2
Powder versus single-crystal diffraction
In a conventional single-crystal experiment a beam of monochromatic
X-rays/neutrons is incident on a suitably mounted and oriented sin-
gle crystal. The phenomenon of diffraction leads to diffracted beams
being produced in certain directions in space (see earlier chapters). The
positions and intensities of these beams are recorded by ﬁlm, point-
detector or (most commonly nowadays) area-detector methods. After
crystal selection and data collection the analysis is usually broken down
into four essentially separate stages that are described in detail in other
chapters:
1. indexing to ﬁnd the unit cell;
2. integration of raw images to produce a single data ﬁle listing
intensities and hkl values for each reﬂection;
3. structure solution (typically by direct methods or Patterson
synthesis);
4. structure completion and reﬁnement.
In a powder experiment (Fig. 17.1), instead of a single crystal one has a
collection of randomly oriented polycrystallites exposed to the beam.
Each of these polycrystallites can be thought of as giving rise to its
own diffraction pattern, and individual ‘spots’ on a ﬁlm become spread
out into rings of diffracted intensity (these rings are the intersections
of cones of diffracted intensity with the ﬁlm). The intensity of these
rings can be recorded using ﬁlm/area-detector methods, but are most
commonly measured by scanning a point detector or 1D line detec-
tor across a narrow strip of the rings. In either case one can represent

the diffraction data as a plot of total diffracted intensity against the
diffraction angle 2θ.
Figure 17.1 immediately shows one of the inherent problems of
powder diffraction. The 3D intensity distribution of a single-crystal
experiment is compressed into the one dimension of 2θ space, lead-
ing to a vast loss of information due to peak overlap. In a metrically
cubic crystal, for example, interplanar spacings are given by dhkl =
a/(h2+k2+l2)1/2. The (221) and (300) reﬂections (which will in general be
of different intensity) will occur at identical values of 2θ and only infor-
mation on their summed intensity is available from a powder diffraction
experiment. For cells of lower symmetry one may get accidental over-
lap (partial or complete) of different hkl reﬂections. For a triclinic cell of
the complexity that would be routine for modern single-crystal meth-
ods (3400 Å3), using a typical laboratory powder diffractometer with
λ = 1.54 Å there would be ∼5500 reﬂections predicted between 0 and
90◦2θ(dmin = 1.09 Å). Even for a highly crystalline material this will
lead to a considerable degree of peak overlap (Sivia, 2000; David, 1999).
In order to minimize the effects of peak overlap it is important to choose
an experimental setup (see Section 17.3) that gives peak widths that are
as sharp as possible. In powder diffraction this is referred to as a ‘high-
resolution’ experiment. Note that this is a different meaning from that
typically implied in single-crystal studies (data recorded to high sin θ/λ
to allow high resolution in Fourier maps).

254
Powder diffraction
There are a number of methods that attempt to alleviate overlap
problems. In one approach some independent information regarding
overlapping peaks can be retrieved from intensity variations around the
Debye–Scherrer rings of deliberately textured samples (Wessels et al.,
1999); in another one can make use of anisotropic thermal expansion
to try to resolve different families of reﬂections at different tempera-
tures. In the absence of such methods, overlap can be minimized only
by recording the highest-resolution data attainable for a given sample.
The problems of peak overlap and the compression of 3D data into 1D
are at the heart of the differences in data analysis between single-crystal
and powder methods. Typically stages 2–4, and often stage 1, listed
abovearemergedintooneandoneworkswiththewholeexperimentally
recorded dataset throughout. The need for high resolution for many
experiments also means that CCD detectors are not widely used, and
pointdetectorsorspeciallydesigned1D/2Dposition-sensitivedetectors
are employed.
17.3
Experimental methods
There are a host of experimental methods available for recording
powder diffraction data, each with its own inherent advantages and
disadvantages. The two most commonly used geometries for obtain-
ing X-ray diffraction data in home laboratories are shown in Fig. 17.2.
In the simplest ‘reﬂection’ or Bragg–Brentano setup (Fig. 17.2a), one
has an X-ray line source at 3. A ﬂat-plate sample is mounted at 4 and
a point detector at 6. The sample is scanned through an angle θ as
the detector is moved through 2θ. The most common laboratory X-
ray source is a sealed Cu tube. To produce monochromatic radiation
(CuKα1λ = 1.540596 Å) one can place the line source of the tube at posi-
tion 1 and a curved focusing Johannsen monochromator (e.g. Ge 111)
at position 2 to produce an effective line source at position 3. Either
a scintillation counter or a linear position-sensitive detector is com-
monly placed at position 6. This arrangement gives high resolution,
but can suffer from high backgrounds for samples that ﬂuoresce under
Cu irradiation (e.g. Co-containing materials). Fluorescence effects can
be reduced by instead placing a monochromator between the sample
and detector. Perhaps the most common laboratory setup uses a post-
sample pyrolytic graphite monochromator at 5 and a point detector,
giving an approximately 2:1 mixture of CuKα1 (λ = 1.540596 Å) and
Kα2 (λ = 1.544493 Å) radiation.
It is also possible to use an energy-dispersive detector at 6 and
dispense with the monochromator altogether. Commercially available
detectors can eliminate Kβ radiation, leaving an α1/α2 mix. The advan-
tage of this is that a typical monochromator is only ∼25–35% efﬁcient,
so its omission leads to dramatic gains in intensity. In the latest gener-
ation of laboratory instruments it is common to use silicon-strip-based
linear detectors. This means that a post-sample monochromator is no

longer employed and an Ni ﬁlter is placed in front of the detector to
remove most of the Kβ radiation. It should be noted that, with the high
count rates achievable, signiﬁcant discontinuities in background can
be observed around strong reﬂections due to the absorption edge of
the ﬁlter.
There are a host of other optical components present in a typical lab-
oratory setup. Between the source and sample one uses a divergence
slit to control the area of sample illumination. To obtain quantitatively
useful intensities it is crucial that the beam remains smaller than the
sample at all angles. To help achieve this, modern instruments may
use a divergence slit that changes size with diffraction angle. This will
lead to systematic changes in peak intensity with 2θ, which must be
corrected in quantitative work. A similar antiscatter slit is often placed
between the sample and detector. To reduce the effects of axial diver-
gence, which can lead to signiﬁcant peak asymmetry, Soller slits are

256
Powder diffraction
used. These are a series of thin metal plates placed in the beam paral-
lel to the plane of Fig. 17.2. For a point detector one must also select a
suitable detector slit. Each of the components in the system will inﬂu-
ence the ﬁnal peak shape in the diffraction pattern (see below), with
ﬁner Sollers or a smaller detector slit giving a better instrumental res-
olution. Each additional component will, however, lead to a signiﬁcant
loss in intensity. With a 0.05-mm detector slit one will get only 1/4 of
the count rate obtainable with a 0.2 mm slit. The optimal experimental
setup will be dependent on the sample, the instrument and the informa-
tion required. A typical ‘quick’ data collection covering 5−90◦2θ on a
conventional laboratory instrument might take 30 min, a higher-quality
scan for Rietveld reﬁnement 12 h or more depending on the instrument
conﬁguration. Line/area detectors may reduce these times by a factor
of 10–100.
Flat-plate samples can be prepared in a number of ways, either
as bulk powders pressed into a recessed holder or sprinkled on an
amorphous surface such as glass or (preferably) a ‘zero-background’
sample holder such as a 511-cut Si wafer. Flat-plate methods are,
however, prone to problems due to preferred orientation, whereby a
non-random arrangement of crystallites is presented to the beam. This
can severely skew diffraction intensities – in extreme cases making
experimental patterns appear completely different from calculated data
or database standards. Several methods for reducing preferred orien-
tation have been described in the literature (Klug and Alexander, 1974;
www.mluri.sari.ac.uk/commercialservices/spraydrykit.html).
The positions and intensities of reﬂections are also inﬂuenced by
factors such as the sample surface roughness and sample absorption
properties. For organic samples low absorption can lead to a signiﬁcant
portion of the diffracted intensity occurring from below the ideal sample
surface, leading to peak shifts and broadening. Surface roughness leads
to peaks being artiﬁcially strong at high 2θ. This method of data col-
lection is therefore perhaps best suited to relatively strongly absorbing
samples or ‘quick’ qualitative measurements.
The transmission setup of Fig. 17.2b is particularly well suited for
studies on low-absorbing organic/molecular materials. Here, the sam-
ple is placed at position 2, usually mounted in a thin-walled glass
capillary of 0.2–1.0 mm internal diameter and spun in the plane of the
page (Fig. 17.3). Samples can also be mounted on thin mylar sheets.
The use of capillaries signiﬁcantly reduces preferred orientation effects,
though sample mounting is slightly more time consuming. For highly
absorbing samples unusual peak shapes may also be observed, but these
can now be calculated/modelled during reﬁnement.
As with any piece of scientiﬁc equipment, the performance of a
powder diffractometer should be regularly checked. Various standard
materials are available to check the alignment of and intensities recorded
by the system (www.nist.gov). There are several commercial suppliers
of powder diffractometers, with many of the modern designs allowing
a number of different experimental conﬁgurations on the same basic

instrument. The introduction of new optical devices such as X-ray mir-
rors to replace monochromators gives further ﬂexibility in experimental
design.
Signiﬁcantly higher ﬂuxes and higher resolution is available at a syn-
chrotron source. Diffractometers such as ID31 at the ESRF and I11 at
Diamond receive a useful ﬂux several orders of magnitude greater than
a typical laboratory instrument and can give very high-resolution data.
The range of energies emitted by a synchrotron source means that wave-
lengths can be selected for speciﬁc experiments. By selecting a short
wavelength one can obtain data to higher values of sin θ/λ with a shorter
scan range; by choosing a longer wavelength the diffraction pattern is
spread out in 2θ, potentially allowing better resolution of overlapping
peaks. One can also select a wavelength close to an absorption edge to
tune scattering factors (resonant or near-edge experiments). It is also
possible to use the entire spectrum of radiation produced and perform
energy-dispersive diffraction. In Bragg’s law (λ = 2dhkl sin θ) one is then
measuring different dhkl values by varying λ at ﬁxed θ rather than vary-
ing θ at ﬁxed λ. This can allow complex experimental setups to be used,
but with current detectors gives lower-resolution data, which can also
be harder to analyze quantitatively.
Powder neutron diffraction offers signiﬁcant potential advantages
over X-ray methods in some situations. In particular, since scattering
occurs from the nucleus rather than electrons, one can detect light atoms
in the presence of heavy atoms (e.g. O/H in the presence of metals). The
penetrating nature of neutrons also gives more conﬁdence that one is

258
Powder diffraction
studying the bulk of a sample rather than a thin surface layer and allows
the use of more complex sample environment equipment. Neutrons are
also scattered by magnetic moments in a material, giving the possibility
of magnetic structure determination. Neutron diffraction can be per-
formed either at a reactor (generally using constant λ neutrons) or at a
spallation source (usually by the time-of-ﬂight method that takes advan-
tage of the full range of neutron wavelengths produced by the source).
Perhaps the major drawback of this technique for the molecular chemist
is the fact that H scatters neutrons incoherently. To avoid unreasonably
high backgrounds it is often necessary to deuterate samples. However,
with the high ﬂuxes available for instruments such as GEM at ISIS and
D20 at ILL (and becoming available on HRPD and at other facilities)
studies on normal hydrogenated materials are becoming increasingly
feasible.
17.4
Information contained in a
powder pattern
The powder diffraction pattern of any material (or mixture of materi-
als) contains information ‘stored’ in three distinct places. Peak positions
are determined by the size, shape and symmetry of the unit cell. Peak
intensities are determined by the arrangement of scattering density (i.e.
atomic co-ordinates) within the unit cell. The peak shape is determined
by a convolution of instrumental parameters (source, optics and detec-
tor contributions) and important information about the microstructure
(domain size, strain) of the sample. This latter information is not usually
considered in small-molecule crystallographic work, but is more notice-
able in powder analysis as peak shapes are immediately apparent when
one visualizes a dataset, and must be considered during many forms of
data analysis.
One feature that distinguishes powder diffraction from single-crystal
work is that structural analysis (i.e. the determination of fractional
co-ordinates of the atoms in the material) is not always, indeed not
normally, the goal of the experiment. The sections below describe
some of the different applications of powder diffraction. They are
arranged approximately in order of increasing complexity of anal-
ysis, and are the applications most likely to be of interest to the
small-molecule/chemistry community.
17.4.1
Phase identiﬁcation
Each (crystalline) phase present in a bulk sample will give rise to a
characteristic set of peaks in a powder diffraction pattern. These can
be compared to a database of known diffraction patterns or compared
against patterns calculated from single-crystal diffraction data. Many
powder diffractometer manufacturers supply search/match software
to compare experimental datasets against the powder diffraction ﬁle

(PDF-2), a collection of around 186 000 (February 2007) datasets main-
tained by the International Centre for Diffraction Data (www.icdd.com).
Very recently a large percentage of the Cambridge Structural Database
(Allen, 2002) (approximately 400 000 entries in February 2007) have been
made commercially available as calculated powder patterns in a for-
mat suitable for automated search/match algorithms. This so-called
PDF-4/Organics contained 312 000 entries in February 2007. Many
single-crystal reﬁnement packages provide a facility for simulating a
diffractionpatternfromeitherareﬁnedstructuralmodelordirectlyfrom
experimental single-crystal data. These simulations can be compared
with experimental data. Many other resources for calculating powder
patterns are available via the web.
Perhaps the most important application of phase identiﬁcation to the
small-molecule crystallographer is in conﬁrming whether the powder
pattern of a bulk sample corresponds to a structure determined from a
single crystal obtained during the same synthesis – there are innumer-
able examples where the few single crystals produced in a synthesis are
due to minor products from side reactions or impurities. The presence
of crystalline co-products (e.g. KCl from a salt-elimination reaction) can
also be readily identiﬁed. A relatively quick powder diffraction experi-
ment can often shed considerable light on otherwise conﬂicting pieces
of analytical data.
With regard to synthesis, especially for solid-state syntheses of
extended materials, powder diffraction provides a straightforward way
of monitoring the course of reaction. Peaks due to starting materials
and other impurities can be readily identiﬁed, allowing the progress
of a reaction to be followed. In many ways powder diffraction is the
solid-state chemist’s equivalent of solution-state NMR.
17.4.2
Quantitative analysis
It is also possible to obtain quantitative information about the compo-
sition of a multiphase sample from powder diffraction data. Various
techniques have been developed based on the analysis of intensities of
individual peaks due to different phases contributing to the pattern, on
whole-pattern intensity analysis, or on multiphase Rietveld reﬁnement
(see below). Speciﬁc details are beyond the scope of this chapter and the
reader is referred elsewhere (Dinnebier and Billinge, 2008).
It is worth noting that extreme care should be taken when deter-
mining/interpreting quantitative composition. Results can be severely
inﬂuenced by methods of sample preparation (see above), data col-
lection and analysis. Careful calibration experiments on the system of
interest are essential. It is also worth noting that it is possible to estimate
the quantity of amorphous material in a sample by powder diffraction
measurements (amorphous materials generally give rise to a gradually
oscillating contribution to the background of the diffraction pattern and
can easily be overlooked), by careful quantitative dilution of a powdered
sample with an additional crystalline phase.

17.4.3
Peak-shape information
Whilst the position and intensity of peaks in a powder pattern are deter-
mined by the unit cell size and contents, their shape and width are
determined by both instrumental effects (which can be corrected for or
modelled) and sample properties such as the size and strain of crys-
tallites and stacking faults (Fig. 17.4) (Klug and Alexander, 1974). The
simplest expression for peak broadening due to sample size (the Scher-
rer formula) predicts that peak width and particle size are related by
fwhm = Kλ/(size × cos θ), where K is a shape factor (often 0.9), fwhm
the peak full width at half-maximum in radians, and λ the wavelength;
absolute numbers from this expression should be treated with caution.
Sample strain leads to a peak-width dependence on tan θ. Note that,
although size and strain both cause peaks to broaden with increasing
2θ, one can distinguish between these effects from their different 2θ
dependence (1/ cos θ and tan θ, respectively). This does, however, need
high-quality data recorded over a wide 2θ range. Practical guidance on
determination of sample size and strain is given in a recent IUCr Round
Robin (Balzar et al., 2004).

Figure 17.5 illustrates the effects of sample size on peak shapes.
Figure 17.5a shows the diffraction pattern of an FePt alloy that con-
tains ∼2.2 nm nanoparticles. Figure 17.5b shows a material with ∼8 nm
domains. It is worth remembering that there are many different ways
of deﬁning the ‘size’ of a material, and that diffraction methods report
the volume-weighted mean column height of the crystallites present.
The apparent ‘size’ of the sample is therefore dependent on the shape
of the domains (only for h00 reﬂections of a perfect cube is the volume-
weightedcolumnheightdirectlyrelatedtocrystallitesize).Theapparent
size determined will also be dependent on the size distribution (often
log normal) present. If precise size information is required then support-
ing evidence from TEM/SEM is very important. In more sophisticated
treatments hkl-dependent peak widths can be used to obtain information

interpretation of peak shapes are given elsewhere (Scardi and Leoni,
2002; Warren, 1969).
17.4.4
Intensity information
The intensities of peaks in a diffraction pattern contain information
about atomic co-ordinates and displacement parameters, just as in a
single-crystal experiment. Early structural work using powder diffrac-
tion data analyzed extracted intensities (e.g. by weighing carefully
cut-out peaks in the early days!) and reﬁnement methods essentially
identical to those used in single-crystal work. Nowadays, it is more
common to employ whole-pattern ﬁtting methods to extract structural
information – principally the Rietveld method discussed in Section 17.5.
For any quantitative work involving powder diffraction intensities it is
essential to consider how aspects of the experimental setup (use of vari-
able slits, Lorentz-polarization factors, etc.) inﬂuence intensities. If the
data are scaled in any way (e.g. to correct for variable slits) it is important
to propagate the standard uncertainty of the intensity in an appropriate
manner.
17.5
Rietveld reﬁnement
One of the main factors that has driven the explosion of powder diffrac-
tionmethodsinrecentyearsisthepopularizationoftheRietveldmethod
(Rietveld, 1969; Young, 1995; McCusker et al., 1999). In this method a
powder pattern is expressed in terms of yobs, the intensity observed
at a given value of 2θ. One can use a structural model (equivalent
to that used in a single-crystal reﬁnement), a model to describe how
experimental peak shapes vary as a function of 2θ, and a model for the
background, to determine the calculated intensity, ycalc, at each exper-
imental value of 2θ. The most commonly used function for describing
powder peaks is a pseudo-Voigt (a mixture of Gaussian and Lorentzian
contributions), though more sophisticated approaches can model peak-
shape contributions from the experimental setup and sample size/strain
directly.
One then typically uses a least-squares method to adjust struc-
tural parameters such as unit cell dimensions, fractional atomic co-
ordinates and displacement parameters, and instrument/experiment-
related parameters to minimize the difference between yobs and ycalc
over the whole experimental pattern (Table. 17.1). The quality of a reﬁne-
ment can be monitored in terms of agreement factors Rwp or RBragg or
goodness-of-ﬁt/χ2 (which compare the Rwp value to the statistically
expected value Rexp). Standard expressions for agreement factors are
given in (17.1)–(17.4); n is the number of observations, p the number of

It is, however, inﬂuenced by, e.g., background points and a high back-
ground can give a misleadingly low Rwp value – background-subtracted
Rwp values are more useful. RBragg is most closely related to single-
crystal R-factors. It is, however, biased by the structural model, which is
usedtopartitionintensitiesofoverlappingreﬂectionstoobtainIhkl(‘obs’)

often a visual inspection of the agreement of observed and calculated
patterns and the difference proﬁle.
An example of a Rietveld reﬁnement of an inclusion compound is
given in Fig. 17.6 (Evans et al., 2001). A number of commercial and
academic software packages are available for Rietveld reﬁnement. The
most widely used are GSAS, Fullprof, descendants of the DBWS code
and Topas (Bruker, 2000; Larson and von Dreele, 1994; Wiles and
Young, 1981; Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1990). Many of these packages offer
the opportunity to reﬁne a model simultaneously with both X-ray and
neutron data, allowing one to utilize the often complementary infor-
mation from the two techniques. They also allow ﬁtting of multiple
phases to each dataset, which can allow quantitative analysis or allow

for the presence of minor impurities during reﬁnement of a phase of
interest.
The practicalities of Rietveld reﬁnement are beyond the scope of this
text. Typically, though, in the early stages of a reﬁnement one would
want to adjust manually or reﬁne the scale parameter and factors such
as the detector zero-point error or sample height until predicted peak
positions match those observed. Parameters describing the peak shape
should then be adjusted until observed and calculated shapes match.
Finally, factors affecting intensities (atomic co-ordinates and displace-
ment parameters) should be reﬁned. As the reﬁnement improves (or
with good software) one should be able to reﬁne many of these param-
eters simultaneously. Details of parameters typically used in a Rietveld
reﬁnement are given in Table 17.1.
Rietveld reﬁnement does contain many traps for the uninitiated.
Reﬁnements are far more likely to diverge compared to single-crystal
reﬁnements; one is far more likely to ﬁnd false minima; it is much eas-
ier with powder work for a wrong model to ﬁt the data well; many
parameters are highly (sometimes completely) correlated so should not
be reﬁned together; there are many ‘fudge factors’ contained in soft-
ware packages that may improve the quality of ﬁt but have no physical
meaning; there are many more reﬁnement options (‘buttons to click’)
than in single-crystal packages. Never reﬁne any parameter unless you
know exactly what it is doing! Finally, it is worth re-emphasizing that
the information content in a powder pattern is almost always lower
than in a single-crystal experiment. In all but the simplest systems
one will not have the 10 observations per parameter that one would

264

like in single-crystal work. If you have a choice, do the single-crystal
experiment!
17.6
Structure solution from powder
diffraction data
It should be emphasized that the Rietveld technique is a reﬁnement
method – one needs an approximate set of starting co-ordinates from
which to begin reﬁnement. Until the late 1990s this meant that Rietveld
reﬁnement was largely conﬁned to extended metal oxides and chalco-
genides where starting models could be inferred from other known
materials. In recent years there have, however, been dramatic break-
throughs in solving structures ab initio from powder data (Harris et al.,
2001, 2002; David et al., 2006).
The process of structure solution of an unknown material from pow-
der data can be divided into several steps. Firstly, one must record the
highest-quality data possible on an (ideally) pure sample. One must
then determine the unit cell parameters from observed peak positions.
For simple systems indexing can be performed by hand (see problems at
the end of the chapter). In most cases indexing is performed by software
packages.Someoperatealongsimilarlinestothoseusedinsingle-crystal
work, others perform exhaustive searches of real space. Indexing pow-
der data is by no means a trivial task and is often the bottleneck to
structure solution. To maximize the chances of success peak positions
must be determined with a high degree of accuracy (not just preci-
sion), for which the use of internal standards and careful peak ﬁtting
is recommended.
Next, the space group symmetry must be determined from systematic
absences. This is again non-trivial, as peak overlap at high 2θ typically
means that it is hard to tell if a particular reﬂection class is present or not.
It may be easy to decide that the (010) reﬂection is absent and the (020)
present, but gaining deﬁnitive information on higher-order reﬂections
is hard. There are software packages that use intensity statistics from
whole-pattern ﬁtting to help with this (Markvardsen et al., 2001).
Once the unit cell and space group are known it is often sensible to
perform a Pawley (or Le Bail) reﬁnement (Pawley, 1981; Le Bail et al.,
1988). These reﬁnement methods are similar to Rietveld reﬁnements but
are performed without a structural model. They are essentially peak-
ﬁtting routines with allowed peak positions constrained by the unit cell
size/shape (which is reﬁned) and symmetry and a single 2θ-dependent
peak shape for the whole pattern. If peaks are not ﬁtted well during a
Pawley reﬁnement then either the cell or space group is wrong or impu-
rities are present. The Pawley reﬁnement also gives an indication of the
best ﬁt that will be achievable in the model-dependent Rietveld reﬁne-
ment. If the ﬁnal Rietveld agreement factors are signiﬁcantly higher
than those for the Pawley reﬁnement, or the ﬁts visually worse, then the
model should be examined carefully.

At this stage one of a number of different routes can be followed. One
possibility is to extract integrated peak intensities from the pattern and
use techniques similar to those employed in single-crystal studies such
as direct methods or Patterson synthesis to solve the structure. Paw-
ley/Le Bail reﬁnements are the best way of obtaining these intensities.
Various software packages exist for structure solution, some dedicated
to overcoming the inherent uncertainties in intensities due to peak over-
lap and data shortage from a powder pattern. Very recently, so-called
‘charge-ﬂipping’ algorithms have been applied to powder data with
some success (Baerlocher et al., 2007; Oszlanyi and Suto, 2004). Struc-
ture completion can then be performed via a series of Fourier difference
maps and Rietveld reﬁnement. For example the 33-atom structure of
γ -ZrW2O8 was solved in this way (Fig. 17.7) (Evans et al., 1997).

Alternatively (and perhaps more powerfully for molecular species
where the connectivity of the molecule, or a signiﬁcant part of it, is
known), one can utilize information about the cell contents in the form
of known molecular fragments and their geometric degrees of freedom
and attempt direct-space structure solution. From the molecular cell
contents one generates a trial structural model and compares its calcu-
lated diffraction pattern to the experimental data. Using a Monte-Carlo
or simulated annealing approach one then adjusts the structural model
in a random fashion and examines again the agreement between the
observed and calculated patterns. The move is then accepted or rejected
based on user-deﬁnable criteria and the process is repeated until the
best agreement between model and experiment is obtained. With efﬁ-
cient algorithms many hundreds of thousands of trial structures can be
generated and tested relatively rapidly even on desktop computers to
produce a structural model that can be improved by Rietveld methods.
Many variations on this general methodology and alternative genetic
and differential evolution algorithms have been developed. Materials
of remarkable complexity have been solved in this way. The 62-atom
structure of the NLO-active inclusion compound of Fig. 17.6, for which
single crystals could not be grown, was solved by a related technique
(Evans et al., 2001).
It should be noted that each stage of the structure solution pathway
from indexing to reﬁnement is complex and potentially insoluble. The
range of techniques for overcoming each barrier is, however, expanding
rapidly in what is a fast-moving research area.

Non-ambient studies
Experiments beyond a simple room-temperature diffraction pattern
can yield considerable insight into the properties of materials. One of
the most readily accessible thermodynamic variables experimentally
is temperature. Commercial attachments are available for most diffrac-
tometers to cool/heat samples from liquid He temperatures to ∼1600◦C.
Variable-temperature experiments allow one to follow, inter alia, phase

transitions in materials, study temperature-dependent polymorphism,
follow hydration/dehydration pathways, and follow the synthesis of
materials in real time (Evans and Evans, 2004).
The possibility of performing a powder diffraction experiment dur-
ing more complex chemical reactions should not be overlooked. Various
workershaveshownthat,usinghigh-energy(andthereforehighlypene-
trating) X-ray beams at synchrotrons, one can literally monitor reactions
occurring in test tubes (or more sophisticated reactors!) in real time by
powder diffraction methods (Evans et al., 1998; Francis and O’Hare,
1998). By way of an example, O’Hare and co-workers have shown that
one can record diffraction patterns of ∼100 mg of a suspension of solid
SnS2 in toluene in as little as 5 s. One can then introduce a molecule
such as cobaltocene and monitor in real time the structural changes and
kinetics of the host-guest intercalation reaction.
The behaviour of materials under applied pressure is also readily
studied by powder diffraction methods. Using small-volume diamond
anvil cells most suitable for X-ray work, pressures of several hun-
dred GPa at temperatures up to several thousand K can be achieved
(Paszkowicz, 2002). Larger volumes of samples can be studied by neu-
tron techniques using gas pressure cells (up to ∼1 GPa on several cm3
of sample) or more sophisticated designs such as the Paris–Edinburgh
design cell (up to ∼30 GPa/370 K on 30 mm3). Such studies have
revealed a wealth of important structural chemistry in a variety of
molecular systems.

Introduction to twinning
Simon Parsons
18.1
Introduction
Twinning is not an uncommon effect in crystallography, although it has
long been considered to be one of the most serious potential obstacles
to structure determination. Computer software has now been devel-
oped to such an extent that previously intractable twinning problems
have yielded results of comparable precision to those obtained with
untwinned samples. Structure determinations from twinned crystals are
therefore now quite common, and the aim of this chapter is to present
an introduction to the phenomenon of twinning.
18.2
A simple model for twinning
Twinning may occur when a unit cell (or a supercell) has higher symme-
try than implied by the space group of the crystal structure. An example
of a system that might be susceptible to twinning is a monoclinic crystal
structure where the unique angle, β, is equal, or very close, to 90◦. In
this case the crystal structure has point group 2/m, but the lattice has
point group mmm. The elements of these point groups are:
2/m : 1, m⊥b, 2//b, 1
mmm : 1, m⊥a, 2//a, m⊥b, 2//b, m⊥c, 2//c, 1.
The important issue is that mmm contains symmetry elements that do
not occur in 2/m. Under these conditions ‘mistakes’ can occur during
crystal growth such that different regions of the crystal (domains) have
their unit cells related by symmetry operations that are elements of mmm
but not of 2/m – a two-fold rotation axis about the a-axis direction for
example.
Thisideacanbeillustratedbybuildingupastackofbricks.Theoverall
shape or outline of a brick has symmetry mmm, but if we consider the
‘dent’(bricklayers call thisthe‘frog’)ononesideplusthewords‘London
Brick’ the point symmetry is only 2. The most obvious way to build a
stack of bricks is to place all the bricks in the same orientation, such
as in Fig. 18.1ii: notice that the bricks are related to each other by the
two-fold axes perpendicular to the page or simple translation – both are

relationship between units cells making up a single crystal. iii. Here some of the bricks have been placed upside-down. The bricks still
ﬁt together, because in turning a brick upside-down we have used a symmetry element of the outline or overall shape of the brick. This
resembles the relationship between unit cells in a twinned crystal. In both ii and iii the ﬁgures are intended to represent a whole crystal.

elements of the space group. The ‘space group’ of the stack of bricks in
Fig. 18.1ii would be P2. However, it is also possible to stack the bricks in
such a way that some of the bricks are placed upside-down (Fig. 18.1iii).
The overall shape of the brick, with the 90◦angles between the edges,
allows this to happen without compromising the stacking of the bricks
in any way. In turning some of the bricks upside-down we have used
a two-fold axis that is a symmetry operation of point group mmm, but
not of point group 2.
Figure 18.1ii is similar to a single crystal; Fig. 18.1iii resembles a
twinned crystal. In Fig. 18.1iii bricks (which correspond to unit cells)
within the same domain are related to each other by translation; bricks
in different domains are related by a translation plus an additional sym-
metry element, such as a rotation, which occurs in the point symmetry of
the outline or overall shape of the brick. This extra symmetry operation
corresponds in crystallography to the twin law. Had the extra element
been chosen to be a mirror plane the mirror image of the words ‘London
Brick’ would have appeared in the second domain, and it is impor-
tant to bear this in mind during the analysis of enantio-pure crystals
of chiral compounds (for example, in protein crystallography the only
possible twin laws are rotation axes). The fraction of the bricks in the
alternative orientation corresponds to the twin scale factor, which in this
example is 0.5.

Twinning in crystals
Monoclinic crystal structures sometimes have β very close to 90◦. If
twinning occurs the unit cells in one domain may be rotated by 180◦

about the a- or c-axes relative to those in the other domain in exactly
the fashion described above for bricks. However, not all monoclinic
crystal structures with β ∼90◦form twinned crystals: twinning will
be observed only if intermolecular interactions across a twin bound-
ary are energetically competitive with those that would have been
formed in a single crystal. For this reason, twinning very commonly
occurs if a high-symmetry phase of a material undergoes a transition
to a lower-symmetry form: a ‘lost’ symmetry element that made certain
interactions equivalent in the high-symmetry form can act as a twin law
in the low-symmetry form. Layered structures, such as the one shown in
Fig. 18.2 (compound 1, see also Section 18.10), are also often susceptible
to twinning if the interactions between layers are rather weak and non-
speciﬁc: alternative orientations of successive layers are energetically
similar. The total energy difference between intermolecular interactions
that occur in a single, as opposed to a twinned, form of a crystal is one
factor that controls the value of the domain scale factor, although in
practice this may also be controlled kinetically, for example by the rate
of crystal growth.
In the foregoing discussion the impression might have been given that
a twinned crystal consists of just two domains.Amonoclinic crystal with

274
Introduction to twinning
β ∼90◦twinned via a two-fold rotation about a may actually consist of
very many domains, but the orientations of the unit cells in any pair of
domains will be related either by the identity operator or by the twin
law. Further examples have been illustrated by Giacovazzo (1992).
The twin law itself forms part of the model used to reproduce a diffrac-
tion pattern, and, as pointed out recently by Schwarzenbach et al. (2006)
it is ‘a purely formal description in terms of symmetry, [providing] no answer to
important questions such as the origins of twinning and the interfaces between
the domains’. Although the properties of a material (e.g. mechanical and
opticalproperties)candependstronglyondomainstructure,itisusually
not necessary to characterize this for the purposes of ordinary structure
analysis. However, the twin scale factor may appear to vary when dif-
ferent regions of a crystal are sampled during data collection. This can
give rise to non-isomorphism effects in protein structure determination
(van Scheltinga, 2003).
18.4
Diffraction patterns from
twinned crystals
Each domain of a twinned crystal gives rise to a diffraction pattern;
what is measured on a diffractometer is a superposition of all these
patterns with intensities weighted according to the domain scale fac-
tors. The relative orientations of the diffraction patterns from different
domains are the same as the relative orientations of the domains. If
the domains are related by a 180◦rotation about the a-axis direction,
then so too are their diffraction patterns. Figure 18.3 shows this for a
twinned monoclinic crystal structure for which β = 90◦. Twinning is a
problem in crystallography because it causes superposition or overlap
between symmetry-inequivalent reﬂections. In Fig. 18.3iii the reﬂection
that would have been measured with indices 102 is actually a composite
of the 102 reﬂection from domain 1 (Fig. 18.3i) and the 102 reﬂection from
domain 2 (Fig. 18-3ii). During structure analysis of a twinned crystal it
is important to deﬁne exactly which reﬂections contribute to a given
intensity measurement: this is the role of the twin law.
In order to treat twinning during reﬁnement the twin law must obvi-
ously form part of the model. Usually it is input into a reﬁnement
program in the form of a 3 ×3 matrix. In the example shown in Fig. 18.3
the 2-fold axis about a will transform a into a, b into −b, and c into −c.
This is the transformation between the cells in different domains of the
crystal; written as a matrix this is

domain (i) and 20% of the other (ii). The values of |E2−1| for each pattern are: i and ii 1.015; iii 0.674; iv 0.743. The ideal (untwinned) value
of |E2 −1| for this centrosymmetric crystal structure is 0.97, meaning that its diffraction pattern is characterized by the presence of both
strong and weak reﬂections; intensities are more evenly distributed in acentric distributions, where |E2 −1| has an ideal value of 0.74.

Introduction to twinning
This two-component twin can be modelled using a quantity |Ftwin,calc|2
that is a linear combination (Equation 1; Pratt et al., 1971) consisting of
|F|2 terms for each component reﬂection weighted according to the twin
scale factor, x, which can be reﬁned.
|Ftwin,calc (h, k, l)|2 = (1 −x)|Fcalc(h, k, l)|2 + x|Fcalc(h, −k, −l)|2.
(18.1)
One striking feature of the reciprocal lattice plot shown in Fig. 18.3iii
is that, while the single-crystal diffraction patterns lack any symmetry
with respect to h- and l-axes (for example, the 102 and 102 reﬂections
have different intensities in Fig. 18.3i), the composite, twinned, pattern
(Fig. 18.3iii) has mirror or two-fold symmetry in both these directions;
thatis,thecompositepatternwithequaldomainvolumes(thatisx = 0.5,
Fig. 18.3iii) appears to have orthorhombic Laue symmetry even though
the crystal structure is monoclinic. In general, for a two-component twin,
if x is near 0.5 then merging statistics will appear to imply higher point
symmetry than that possessed by the crystal structure. As x deviates
from0.5thenthemerginginthehigher-symmetrypointgroupgradually
becomes poorer (Fig. 18.3iv); nevertheless, similar merging statistics for
different Laue classes is a feature that is often taken to indicate twinning.
Another striking feature of the twinned diffraction pattern shown in
Fig. 18.3iii is that it appears to have a more acentric intensity distribution
than the component patterns. The superposition of the diffraction pat-
terns arising from the different domains tends to average out intensities
because strong and weak reﬂections sometimes overlap. The quantity
|E2 −1|, which adopts values of 0.97 and 0.74 for ideal centric and acen-
tric distributions, respectively, may assume a value in the range 0.4–0.7
for twinned crystal structures. Intensity statistics can therefore be a valu-
able tool for the diagnosis of twinning, although it is important to bear
in mind all the usual caveats relating to the assumption of a random
distribution of atoms, which is broken, for example, in the presence of
heavy atoms or non-crystallographic symmetry. Rees (1980) has shown
that an estimate of the twin scale factor, x, can be derived from the value
of |E2 −1|. Other procedures have been developed by Britton (1972) and
Yeates (1988), and these have been compared by Kahlenberg (1999). The
latter statistical tests will fail, though, for twins with x near 0.5. If the
value of x is known, and is not near 0.5, (18.1) can be used to ‘de-twin’
a dataset. This procedure may be useful for the purposes of structure
solution, although it is generally preferable to reﬁne the structure using
the original twinned dataset.
Common signs of twinning have been given by Herbst-Irmer and
Sheldrick (1998, 2002) and are listed in Section 18.9.
18.5
Inversion, merohedral and
pseudo-merohedral twins
Twinning can occur whenever a compound crystallizes in a unit cell with
a higher point group than that corresponding to the space group. This

can occur for crystal structures in non-centrosymmetric space groups,
since all lattices have inversion symmetry. Thus, a crystal of a compound
in a space group such as P21 may contain enantiomorphic domains. This
type of twinning does not occur for an enantiopure compound, and it
can therefore be ruled out in protein crystallography, for example. The
twin law in this case is the inversion operator
⎛
⎝
−1

⎠,
and is most commonly encountered in Flack’s method for ‘absolute
structure’ determination (Flack, 1983). The domain scale factor in this
case is referred to as the Flack parameter.
Twinning may also occur in lower-symmetry tetragonal, trigonal and
cubic systems. Thus, a tetragonal structure in point group 4/m may twin
about the two-fold axis along [110], which is a symmetry element of the
higher-symmetry tetragonal point group, 4/mmm. The twin law in this
case is
⎛
⎝
0
1
0

0
0

⎞
⎠,
and this matrix may also be used in the treatment of low-symmetry
trigonal, hexagonal and cubic crystal structures, producing diffraction
patterns with apparent 3m1, 6/mmm and m3m symmetry, respectively,
when the domain scale factor, x, is 0.5.
Two further twin laws need to be considered in low-symmetry trig-
onal crystals. A two-fold rotation about [110], mimicking point group
31m when x = 0.5, is expressed by the matrix
⎛
⎝
0
−1
0
−1
0
0
0

⎞
⎠.
By twinning via a 2-fold axis about [001] a trigonal crystal may also
appear from merging statistics to be hexagonal if x = 0.5. The twin law
in this case is
⎛
⎝
−1
0
0
0
−1
0
0
0

⎞
⎠.
In rhombohedral crystal structures twinning of this type leads to
obverse–reverse twinning (see below).
The point groups of the crystal lattices (1 for triclinic, 2/m for
monoclinic, mmm for orthorhombic, 4/mmm for tetragonal, 3m for
rhombohedral, 6/mmm for hexagonal and m3m for cubic) are referred
to as the holohedral point groups. Those point groups that belong to

278
Introduction to twinning
the same crystal family, but that are subgroups of the relevant holo-
hedral point group, are referred to as merohedral point groups (Hahn
and Klapper discuss this classiﬁcation in detail in International Tables for
Crystallography, Volume A). Thus, 4/m is a merohedral point group of
4/mmm. With the exception of obverse-reverse twinning (see below), in
all the cases described in the previous paragraphs in this section the twin
law is a symmetry operation of the relevant holohedry (i.e. of the crystal
lattice) that is not expressed in the point symmetry corresponding to the
crystal structure. For this reason this type of phenomenon is referred to
as twinning by merohedry. Such twins are often described as merohedral
and, although this usage is occasionally criticised in the literature (Catti
and Ferraris, 1976), it appears to have stuck.† Though it is quite rare in
† Holo and mero are Greek stems mean-
ing whole and part, respectively. This
‘French School’ nomenclature was origi-
nally devised to describe crystal morphol-
ogy, and is used here because it is currently
popular in the literature. Different nomen-
clature is also encountered; see, for exam-
ple, Giacovazzo (1993) or van der Sluis
(1989).
molecular crystals, twins containing more than two domain variants are
sometimes observed; more commonly only two are present, however,
and such twins are also described as hemihedral twins.
Twinning by merohedry should be carefully distinguished from the
example described in Section 18.4, where a monoclinic crystal struc-
ture accidentally had a β angle near 90◦; for example, there is nothing
accidental about a low-symmetry tetragonal structure having a lattice
with symmetry 4/mmm: all low-symmetry tetragonal structures have
this property. Put another way, the holohedry of the tetragonal lattice is
4/mmm; the low-symmetry tetragonal structure might belong to point
group 4/m, 4, or 4, which are all, nevertheless, still tetragonal point
groups; this is what would make this twinning by merohedry.
A monoclinic crystal structure that happens to have β ∼90◦has a
lattice with, at least approximately, the mmm symmetry characteristic of
the orthorhombic crystal family. If twinning occurs by a two-fold axis
along a or c, the crystal is not merohedrally twinned, since monoclinic
and orthorhombic are two different crystal families. This type of effect is
instead referred to as twinning by pseudo-merohedry. A further example
might occur in an orthorhombic crystal where two axes (b and c, say)
are of equal length (pseudo-tetragonal). The twin law in this case could
be a four-fold axis along a:
⎛
⎝
1
0
0

⎞
⎠.
A monoclinic crystal where a ∼c and β ∼120◦may be twinned by
a three-fold axis along b. The clockwise and anticlockwise three-fold
rotations (3+ and 3−) about this direction are:
⎛
⎝
0

⎞
⎠and
⎛
⎝

⎠,
potentially yielding a three-component pseudo-merohedral twin
appearing from the diffraction symmetry to be hexagonal.

18.6
Derivation of twin laws
279
A trigonal crystal structure may be merohedrally twinned via a two-
foldaxisalongthe[001]direction(paralleltothethree-foldaxis),because
this is a symmetry element of the 6/mmm holohedry. However, the
rhombohedral lattice holohedry is 3m, and this point group does not
contain a two-fold axis parallel to the three-fold axis.Although twinning
via a two-fold axis in this direction can certainly occur for rhombohedral
crystal structures, it is not twinning by merohedry. It is, instead, referred
to as obverse-reverse twinning or twinning by reticular merohedry; this
is an important distinction, because overlap between reﬂections from
different domain variants in obverse-reverse twins affects only one-
third of the intensity data. This has recently been discussed in detail
by Herbst-Irmer and Sheldrick (2002).
Note that higher symmetry may be ‘hidden’ in a centred setting of a
unit cell, and not be immediately obvious from the cell dimensions, and
it is necessary to inspect carefully the output from whichever program
has been used to check the metric symmetry of the unit cell [Herbst-
Irmer and Sheldrick (1998) have described two illustrations of this].
18.6
Derivation of twin laws
In Section 18.4 the case of a monoclinic crystal where β ∼90◦was exam-
ined, and it was shown that twinning could occur about a two-fold axis
in the a-axis direction. This leads to overlap between reﬂections with
indices hkl and h −k −l. Twinning via a two-fold axis along c would
lead to overlap between reﬂections with indices hkl and −h −kl. How-
ever, since reﬂections h −k −l and −h −kl are symmetry related by the
monoclinic two-fold axis along b∗, which must be present if the crystal
point group is 2 or 2/m, these twin laws are equivalent. However, in the
twinning about two three-fold axes described in Section 18.5 for a mono-
clinic crystal with a ∼c and β ∼120◦, the rotations are not equivalent
because they are not related by any of the symmetry operations of point
group 2/m.
It is usually the case that several equivalent descriptions may be used
to describe a particular twin. However, several distinct twin laws may be
possible, and they can be expressed simultaneously. There clearly exists
a potential for possible twin laws to be overlooked during structure
analysis. Flack (1987) has described the application of coset decomposi-
tion to this problem, enabling this danger to be systematically avoided.
The procedure has been incorporated by Litvin and Boyle into the com-
puter programs TWINLAWS (Schlessman and Litvin, 1995) and COSET
(Boyle, 2007).†

Introduction to twinning
twin laws is given by
n = hH

(18.2)
where hG and hH are the orders of point groups G and H, respectively.
For example, in a protein crystallizing in point group 2 (space group
P2, C2 or P21) with a unit cell with dimensions a = 30.5, b = 30.5,
c = 44.9 Å β = 90.02◦, G is point group 2 and H is effectively point
group 422 (4/mmm in principle, but mirror symmetry is not permitted
for an enantiopure protein crystal). The orders of G and H are 2 and 8,
respectively, and so this crystal may suffer from up to three twin laws
to form, at most, a four-domain twin (the reference domain plus three
others).
Coset decomposition yields the symmetry elements that must be
added to point group G to form the higher point group H. Table 18.1
shows the output of the program TWINLAWS, listing decomposition of
point group 422 into cosets with point group 2. Possible twin laws are
two-fold axes about the [1 0 0], [−1 1 0] and [1 1 0] directions. However,
the two-fold rotation about [1 1 0] is an equivalent twin law to the 4−
(i.e. the 43) rotation about [001] and the two-fold axis about [1 0 0] is
equivalent to that about [0 0 1].

Non-merohedral twinning
In merohedral and pseudo-merohedral twinning the nature of the twin
law matrix means that all integral Miller indices are converted into other
integer triples, so that all reciprocal lattice points overlap. This usually
means that all reﬂections are affected by overlap, although reﬂections
from one domain may overlap with systematic absences from another.
Twins in which only certain zones of reciprocal lattice points overlap are
classiﬁed as being non-merohedral. In these cases only reﬂections that
meet some special conditions on h, k and/or l are affected by twinning.
A non-merohedral twin law is commonly a symmetry operation
belonging to a higher-symmetry supercell.Asimple example that might
be susceptible to this form of twinning is an orthorhombic crystal struc-
ture where 2a ∼b (Fig. 18.4i). A metrically tetragonal supercell can be
formed by doubling the length of a so that there is a pseudo-four-fold
axis along c. The diffraction pattern from one domain of the crystal is
related to that from the other by a 90◦rotation about c∗. Superposition
of the two diffraction patterns shows that data from the ﬁrst domain are
affected by overlap with data from the second domain only when k is
even (Fig. 18.4iv).
For the purposes of structure analysis the relationship between the
cells in Fig. 18.4i (the twin law) needs to be expressed with respect to
the axes of the true orthorhombic cell.

Introduction to twinning
domain. The 413 reﬂection in the grey domain would be unaffected
by twinning.
It is likely that the example given here would index readily on
the tetragonal supercell, but notice the bizarre systematic absences in
Fig. 18.4iv. Zones of unusual systematic absences are frequently a sign
that a crystal is non-merohedrally twinned. This pseudo-translational
symmetry should enable the true orthorhombic cell to be inferred, and it
can be characterized by a strong non-origin peak in a Patterson synthesis
(see Section 18.10, Example 8).
In orthorhombic and higher systems potential non-merohedral twin
laws can often be derived from inspection of the unit cell dimensions.
In low-symmetry crystals the twin law is usually less obvious (general
procedures are given below), but it is possible to make a few general
observations that apply to monoclinic crystals. In these cases the twin
law is often found to be a 2-fold axis along the unit cell a- or c-axes. The
matrix for a two-fold rotation about the a-axis is:

18.8
The derivation of non-merohedral
twin laws
Diffraction patterns from non-merohedrally twinned crystals contain
many more spots than would be observed for an untwinned sam-
ple. Since individual spots may come from different domains of the
twin such diffraction patterns are frequently difﬁcult to index. Over-
lap between reﬂections may be imperfect in some or all zones of data
affected, and integration and data reduction needs to be performed care-
fully. Software for integrating datasets from non-merohedral twins and
performing absorption corrections has recently become available [for
example, SAINT version 7 (Bruker-Nonius, 2002); TWINABS (Sheldrick,
2002)].

18.9
Common signs of twinning
283
Excellent
programs
such
as
DIRAX
(Duisenberg,
1992)
and
CELL_NOW (Sheldrick, 2005) have been developed to index diffrac-
tion patterns from non-merohedral twins. In many cases a pattern can
be completely indexed with two orientation matrices, and both these
programs offer procedures by which the relationship between these
alternative matrices is analyzed to suggest a twin law: if two domains
are indexed with orientation matrices A1 and A2 the twin law is given
by the product A−1
2 A1.
It is usually the case that twinning can be described by a two-fold
rotation about a direct or reciprocal lattice direction. Indeed, it has been
shown by Le Page and Flack that, if two such directions are parallel, and
the vectors describing them have a dot product greater than two, then a
higher-symmetry supercell can be derived. The program CREDUC (Le
Page, 1982) is extremely useful for investigating this; it is available in
the Xtal suite of software (Hall et al., 1992), which can be downloaded
from http://www.ccp14.ac.uk. The same procedure is available in the
LePage routine in PLATON (Spek, 2003).
It is sometimes the case that the ﬁrst intimation the analyst has that
a crystal is twinned is during reﬁnement. Symptoms such as large,
inexplicable difference peaks and a high R factor may indicate that
twinning is a problem, while careful analysis of poorly ﬁtting data
reveals that they belong predominantly to certain distinct zones in
which |Fobs|2 is systematically larger than |Fcalc|2. If twinning is not
taken into account it is likely that these zones are being poorly mod-
elled, and that trends in their indices may provide a clue as to a
possible twin law. The computer program ROTAX (Cooper et al., 2002;
also available from http://www.ccp14.ac.uk) makes use of this idea to
identify possible twins laws. A set of data with the largest values of
[|Fobs|2 −|Fcalc|2]/σ(|Fobs|2) is identiﬁed and the indices transformed by
two-fold rotations or other symmetry operations about possible direct
and reciprocal lattice directions. Matrices that transform the indices of
the poorly ﬁtting data to integers are identiﬁed as possible twin laws.
The analyst then has a set of potential matrices that might explain the
source of the reﬁnement problems described above.Arelated procedure,
TwinRotMat, available in PLATON (Spek, 2003), works by identifying
reﬂections with very similar d-spacings.
18.9
Common signs of twinning
The following list of common signs of twinning is based on that origi-
nally given by Herbst-Irmer and Sheldrick (1998). Use of these signs in
diagnosing twinning problems is illustrated in Section 18.10.
1. The metric symmetry of the lattice is higher than the Laue symmetry of
the diffraction pattern.
The reasons for this were discussed in Section 18.4. Three common
cases in small-molecule crystallography are as follows.

284
Introduction to twinning
• Monoclinic P with β near 90◦(metrically orthorhombic); use
a two-fold axis along either a or c as the twin law.
• Triclinic, but transformable to monoclinic C; use a two-fold
rotation about the pseudo-monoclinic b-axis direction as the
twin law.
• Monoclinic P, but transformable to orthorhombic C; use a
two-fold rotation about one of the pseudo-orthorhombic cell
axes as the twin law. (The axis chosen should not correspond
to the monoclinic b-axis!)
If the twin scale factor is near 0.5, Rint in the high-symmetry group
will be the same or only slightly higher than in the lower-symmetry
group. Even when the twin scale factor deviates signiﬁcantly
from 0.5 the higher symmetry Rint may still be less than about
0.4; values of 0.60 or higher might be expected for untwinned
samples (although pseudo-symmetry in, for example, heavy-atom
positions can give rise to a similar effect).
2. The space group can not be determined, or, if it can, it is unusual.
Zones of systematic absences can be contaminated by overlap with
reﬂections from another domain in the twin.
What constitutes ‘unusual’ depends on the material being stud-
ied. For example, space group C2/m is uncommon for molecular
compounds but not uncommon at all for ‘extended’ or ‘inorganic’
structures. In the author’s experience of molecular crystal struc-
tures, however, crystals appearing to be C-centred orthorhombic
are often (though not always) twinned monoclinic P, and those
appearing from systematic absences to be in C2, Cm or C2/m are
triclinic twins in P1. Note that, even here, space group C2 is quite
common for enantiopure compounds, and C2, Cm or C2/m are not
uncommon at all for ‘inorganic’ compounds such as metal oxides.
Finally, of course, some compounds really do crystallize in unusual
space groups. Unusual zones of absences may not be revealed by
a space group determination program, but can be identiﬁed by a
large peak in a Patterson map or by inspection of reciprocal lattice
plots.
3. High symmetry.
Low-symmetry tetragonal, trigonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal and
cubic crystals are always potentially twinned by merohedry; low-
symmetry trigonal crystals seem to be particularly prone. It is good
practice to test such structures for twinning as a matter of routine:
possible twin laws are given in Section 18.5. 95% of molecular crys-
tal structures are either triclinic, monoclinic or orthorhombic, and
so pseudo-merohedral twinning should always be kept in mind
when such a material appears to be tetragonal or higher symmetry.
High symmetry is common for ‘inorganic’ structures.
4. The value of |E2 −1| is low.
The reasons for this were discussed in Section 18.4.
5. The sample being studied has undergone a phase transition.

Examples
285
This was brieﬂy discussed in Section 18.3; and examples are
available in Gaudin et al. (2000) and Guelylah et al. (2001).
6. Indexing problems.
Perhaps the diffraction pattern did not index using default pro-
cedures. Alternatively, the unit cell volume may seem too high
(implying Z′ > 3) or there is a very long cell axis; though both
of these features are possible for untwinned crystals, they are
unusual. Close inspection of peak proﬁles is a useful diagnos-
tic tool: twinning may be evidenced by a mixture of sharp and
split peaks in the diffraction pattern. Indexing problems are a
very common warning sign of non-merohedral twinning. Pseudo-
merohedral twins may be difﬁcult to index if peaks from different
domains overlap well at low resolution but not at high resolu-
tion: this may occur, for example, in a monoclinic crystal where β
deviates by more than ∼0.5◦from 90◦.
7. The structure does not appear to solve.
Most small-molecule structures solve readily with modern soft-
ware, and twinning should be considered in cases where automatic
solution fails (especially if the dataset appears to be of good qual-
ity). The possibility that the crystal being studied is very different in
composition from that intended should also be carefully explored.
Twinning reveals itself in the Patterson function, which becomes
a weighted superposition of the function derived from each
domain; this is discussed by Dauter (2003).
8. The reﬁnement is unsatisfactory.
The R factor may stick at a value much higher than Rint; the
difference map may show inexplicable peaks; F2
o may be consis-
tently higher than F2
c for poorly ﬁtting data; or ⟨F2
o⟩/⟨F2
c⟩may be
systematically high for the weakest data.
18.10
Examples
Example 1. This example illustrates items 1, 2 and 7 in Section 18.9.
Crystals of the compound C30H27N (Fig. 18.2) diffracted rather weakly.
The unit cell appeared to be orthorhombic with dimensions a = 8.28,
b = 12.92, c = 41.67 Å. The volume ﬁts for Z = 8, the value of |E2 −1|
was 0.725. Z = 8 is not unusual for orthorhombic crystals; the c-axis
is long, but there were no other indexing solutions that were able to
account for all the reﬂections in the diffraction pattern. Although the
crystal was twinned the mean value of |E2 −1| is not abnormal for
a non-centrosymmetric structure. However, the space group assuming
orthorhombic symmetry appeared to be P2212, which is very rare.
Mergingstatistics(Rint)wereasfollows:mmm,0.14;2/mwithaunique,
0.13; 2/m with b unique 0.06, 2/m with c unique 0.09. The lowest Rint
assumed monoclinic symmetry with the b-axis of the orthorhombic
cell corresponding to the unique axis of the monoclinic cell. Notice,

286
Introduction to twinning
though, that merging in the higher-symmetry Laue class (mmm) yields
Rint that is only moderately higher than in 2/m.
Taken with the space group information described above this seemed
to be a twin. The twin law used was
⎛
⎝
1
0
0

and space group P21 was assumed. The symmetry of the lattice is mmm
(the order of this group is 8); the crystal structure belongs to point
group 2/m (order 4). Hence, we need to specify (8/4) −1 = 1 twin
law (Eqn. 18.2).
The structure was difﬁcult to solve, and repeated attempts to ﬁnd a
solution in different direct methods packages were unsuccessful. The
molecule contains a rigid fragment, and a position and orientation for
one molecule (there are four in the asymmetric unit) was obtained by
Patterson search methods (DIRDIF, Beurskens et al., 1996) using the rigid
part of the molecule as a search fragment. The structure was completed
by iterative cycles of least-squares and Fourier syntheses (SHELXL97;
Sheldrick, 2008). A search for missed space-group symmetry did not
reveal any glide or mirror planes: the ﬁnal R factor was 0.1, and the twin
scale factor was 0.392(5).
Patterson methods are normally applied to the solution of heavy-
atom structures, but they are a valuable alternative to direct methods
when the latter fail for light-atom structures containing a rigid fragment.
Solution packages do not, as a rule, enable a twin law to be applied dur-
ing structure solution. The exception to this is the program SHELXD
(Sheldrick, 2008), which has proved to be very useful for solution of
twinned structures.
Example 2. This is an example of an apparently ‘impossible’ space
group (item 2 in Section 18.9), and also illustrates the comments made
about twinning in Sections 18.2 and 18.3. A nickel complex was appar-
ently orthorhombic P with cell dimensions a = 9.93, b = 10.95, c =
14.14 Å; all three cell angles were indistinguishable from 90◦, and Rint
was 0.079 for mmm symmetry. However, only the following systematic
absences were observed: h00 with h odd; 0k0 with k odd; 00l with l
odd, and hk0 with h + k odd – a pattern that is not consistent with any
orthorhombic space group. If the crystal system is taken to be mono-
clinic, with the original c-axis corresponding to the unique monoclinic
b direction, the space group is P21/n. Rint for 2/m symmetry is 0.039.
The structure solved for Ni and a few light-atom positions by direct
methods. The twin law

was applied, and the remaining atoms were located in a difference map.
The symmetry of the lattice is effectively mmm, and the crystal structure

belongs to point group 2/m, and as in example 1 we need to specify
(8/4) −1 = 1 twin law. The ﬁnal R factor [based on F and data with
F > 4σ(F)] was 0.061, and the twin scale factor was 0.373(3).
Example 3. This example also illustrates a structure in which correct
space group determination was hindered by twinning. Twinning can
cause systematic absences from one domain to overlap with reﬂections
from a second domain, and this may yield a pattern of absences that is
inconsistent with any known space group (as we saw in Example 2), or
that leads to an incorrect space group assignment (as is illustrated here).
The diffraction pattern of a palladium complex was found to index
on a primitive monoclinic unit cell with dimensions a = 3.84, b = 9.73,
c = 21.20 Å, β = 95.4◦; Rint = 0.037 for point group 2/m. This cell can
be transformed using the matrix
M =

to a metrically orthorhombic C cell with dimensions a = 3.84, b = 42.20,
c = 9.73 Å, α = β = 90◦, γ = 89.8◦, but Rint for mmm symmetry was
0.434. The merging statistics imply that the crystal is monoclinic. The
systematic absence data are summarized in Table 18.2.
The data in Table 18.2 appear to show a ‘clean’ set of absences for the
0k0 zone, but signiﬁcant intensity for the three h0l zones, indicating that

on h0l: that for h + k odd is over ten times smaller than either h odd or
l odd. In fact, the crystal is twinned, and the space group is P21/n, but
the n-glide absences are contaminated by overlap of reﬂections from the
different domains.
As in the previous examples, we need to specify one twin law. A two-
fold rotation about either the a- or b-axis of the orthorhombic cell could
be used, but it is not necessary to use both (this can be proved using
coset decomposition). A two-fold rotation about the orthorhombic c-
axis should not be used as a twin law as this corresponds to the b-axis

Introduction to twinning
of the monoclinic cell, and a two-fold axis about this direction is part of
the monoclinic symmetry already.
With respect to the orthorhombic cell axes, a two-fold rotation about
the orthorhombic a-axis direction is given by the matrix
R =
⎛
⎝
1
0
0
0
−1

⎠.
However, it is necessary to express this operation with respect to the
monoclinic axis system because this is being used to describe the
structure. The matrix M, which transforms the monoclinic cell to the
orthorhombiccell,wasdeﬁnedabove,andtherequiredtwinlawisgiven
by the triple matrix product M−1RM:

This procedure can be used whenever it is necessary to transform an
operation from one axis system to another.
Consider the effect of the twin law on the h0l reﬂections:
⎛

⎛

⎞
⎠.
For example, the systematically absent 102 reﬂection will overlap with
the 103 reﬂection from the second domain: the 103 reﬂection is not sys-
tematically absent. This explains why the systematic absences for the
n-glide appear to have some intensity in Table 18.2.
Even though it was twinned this crystal structure solved easily, and
reﬁned to R = 0.042; the twin scale factor was only 0.07, which explains
the very different merging statistics in 2/m and mmm.
This structure could have been solved in P21, but reﬁnement would
have been unstable; the extra symmetry could have been located by a
program such as PLATON/ADDSYM or MISSYM. Symmetry checking
should be carried out as a matter of routine for all crystal structures, but
it is particularly important to do this for twinned structures because of
the extra pitfalls attendant on space group determination.
Example 4. The diffraction pattern measured from a crystal of a nickel
complex of composition C17H30N6NiO6 indexed on the monoclinic C-
centred unit cell a = 15.20, b = 54.49, c = 10.14 Å, β = 90.73◦. Rint for
2/m symmetry was 0.076. The space group appeared to be one of C2, Cm
or C2/m; solution in each of these was attempted, but no recognizable
structure solution was obtained. Merging in Laue class 1 yielded Rint =
0.038, which is somewhat better than in 2/m, and this indicated that the
structure was really triclinic.

Examples
289
The conventional triclinic setting of the unit cell is a = 10.14, b = 15.20,
c = 28.29 Å, α = 74.42, β = 89.80 and γ = 89.27◦, and transformation is
accomplished with the matrix:
⎛
⎝

−1
1
0
0
0.5
−0.5

⎞
⎠
(a cell reduction program, such as XPREP, will provide this information).
The twin law is a two-fold rotation about the pseudo-monoclinic b
direction, but this needs to be expressed with respect to the triclinic
axes. As in Example 3, this requires the formation of a triple matrix
product:
⎛
⎝

⎠,
where the three matrices to be multiplied are (from right to left) the
triclinic to monoclinic transformation, a two-fold axis about b in the
monoclinic cell and the monoclinic to triclinic transformation. Note that
the ﬁrst and third matrices are the inverses of each other.
The crystal structure solved readily by direct methods in P1, and
reﬁned to R = 0.037, with a twin scale factor of 0.2668(7). Z′ for this
structure was 4, which is unusually high, though symmetry checking
using PLATON/ADDSYM did not indicate any missed translational or
other symmetry.
An alternative, but equivalent strategy in this example would have
been to work in the non-standard setting C1, using the pseudo-
monoclinic axis system and the twin law
⎛
⎝
−1
0
0

⎠.
This might have been preferred on the grounds that use of the non-
standard space group setting made the choice of twin law more obvious.
Example 5. The crystal structure of B10F12 is tetragonal. Rint was 0.020
in point group 4/m, but 0.060 in 4/mmm. The absences were consistent
with space group I41/a; even though this space group is centrosym-
metric the mean value of |E2 −1| was only 0.686. The ambiguous Laue
symmetry,thehighmetricsymmetryandlowmeanvalueof|E2−1|were
taken as signs that the structure could be twinned (signs 1, 3 and 4 in
Section 18.9).
The structure was solved easily by direct methods (SIR92) in default
mode in I41/a but, on reﬁning the structure, R appeared to stick at
0.23, even with anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms. Low-
symmetry tetragonal structures are always susceptible to twinning via

one of the symmetry elements of point group 4/mmm that is not present
in 4/m. One such operator is a two-fold axis about [110], expressed by
the matrix
⎛
⎝

⎠.
Application of this matrix as a twin law, together with reﬁnement of
the twin scale factor, caused R to drop immediately to 0.023; the twin
scale factor was 0.416(2).
The orders of 4/mmm and 4/m are 16 and 8, respectively. Therefore
we need to consider (16/8) −1 = 1 twin law (Eqn. 18.2). Coset decom-
position of 4/mmm with respect to 4/m yields the data in Table 18.3. The
elements in the ﬁrst line of the table are those of point group 4/m; any
of the elements in the second line of the table could have been used as
a twin law: the two-fold axis along [110] was used above, but use of a
two-fold axis along [100] or [010], or a mirror perpendicular to [−1 1 0]
would have modelled the data equally well.
Example 6. The compound Et3NH+Cl−crystallizes with a metrically
hexagonal unit cell, of dimensions a = 8.254 and c = 6.996 Å (Churakov
and Howard, 2004). The systematic absences were consistent with space
groups P63mc and P31c, and merging in 6mm and 31m yielded similar
statistics. The mean value of |E2 −1| was 0.678, slightly lower than
expected for a non-centrosymmetric space group. The data could be
modelled in P63mc, though the structure was disordered; R was 0.054,
though the Flack parameter was rather imprecise [0.0(4)], and the high-
est difference map peak was +0.82 eÅ−3, which is high for a compound
of this composition.
The high symmetry, reﬁnement statistics, the low mean value of
|E2 −1| and the similar merging in 6mm and 31c point to twinning
(1, 3, 4, and 8 in Section 18.9), and so the structure was also solved and
reﬁned in P31c. This yielded an ordered model. The R factor was 0.072
before twinning was modelled, but application of a twin law (see below)
caused R to drop to 0.019, with difference map extremes of +0.18 and
−0.09 eÅ−3. These statistics are clearly superior to those obtained in
P63mc, and illustrate the comment made by Herbst-Irmer and Sheldrick
(1998) that it is worth investigating the possibility of twinning before
investing time and effort in disorder modelling.

The orders of 6/mmm (the lattice holohedry) and 31m are 24 and 6,
respectively, and so to investigate twinning completely we need to con-
sider (24/6) −1 = 3 different twin laws (i.e. the crystal could consist of
up to four domains). Table 18.4 shows coset decomposition of 6/mmm
and 31m. The ﬁrst line in the table shows the elements of 31m, and the
second line a set of possible merohedral twin laws that could model a
second domain; Churakov and Howard used the mirror perpendicular
to [100], expressed by the matrix
⎛
⎝
−1

⎞
⎠,
but any of the other elements in row two of Table 18.4 would have
worked equally well.
31m is a non-centrosymmetric point group, and so the ‘absolute struc-
ture’ should be determined: two Flack parameters are needed, one for
each of the domains so far identiﬁed. It is easy to forget to do this, but use
of coset decomposition ensures the absolute structure will be correctly
treated! The third line of Table 18.4 contains the element 1: inclusion of
the inversion operator (or any other other elements in row 3) as a second
twin law would model twinning by inversion (i.e. the Flack parameter)
in the ﬁrst domain of the crystal. The elements in the fourth row would
enable the Flack parameter in the second domain to be reﬁned. In the
widely used program SHELXL the instructions
TWIN −1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 −4
BASF 0.25 0.25 0.25
would ensure that all twin laws were included in the model; other
programs may need each twin law matrix to be input explicitly.
After reﬁnement, the scale factors for the four domains of the crystal
were 0.46(4), 0.48(4), 0.05(5) and 0.01(4). The last two scale factors are the
Flack parameters for the ﬁrst two domains; the fact that they are very
near zero with small standard uncertainties shows that the absolute
structures of the ﬁrst and second domains are correct.

in the analysis of twinned crystals is found in the crystal structure of the

of this compound are a = 5.12, b = 10.31, c = 17.99 Å, α = 106.6, β = 97.8,
γ = 90.1◦, and the space group is P1. Symmetry checking shows that the
triclinic unit cell can be transformed to a metrically nearly orthorhom-
bic unit cell with dimensions a = 5.12, b = 10.31, c = 31.14 Å by the

The lattice effectively has mmm symmetry (order 8), but the space
group belongs to point group 1 (order 2). There are therefore three
twin laws (8/2 −1 = 3) to consider. A unique set of twin laws can
be obtained by decomposing mmm into cosets with 1 (Table 18.5); we
shall use the two-fold rotations about the [100], [010] and [001] directions
of the orthorhombic cell as the twin laws. These operations need to be
expressed with respect to the triclinic axes, and this is achieved by form-
ing triple matrix products as in examples 3 and 4; in each case the three
matrices are (from right to left) the triclinic to orthorhombic transfor-
mation, a two-fold axis in the orthorhombic cell and the orthorhombic
to triclinic transformation:

All four domains (i.e. the reference domain and the three generated by
the three twin laws above) were found to be signiﬁcantly populated,
though the populations were found to be different in different crystals.
R converged to ∼0.04. Further details of this structure determination are
given in Bolotina et al. (2005) and in Schwarzenbach et al. (2006), where
the twinning is interpreted in terms of layer stacking faults.
Example 8. The following exempliﬁes analysis of a non-merohedrally
twinned crystal. Trimethyltin hydride (Me3SnH) is a gas under ambient
conditions, and its melting point is ∼160 K. A sample was crystallized

in situ in a capillary. The diffraction pattern failed to index using routine
procedures, but was indexed using the twin-indexing package DIRAX.
Indexing problems are the most common sign of non-merohedral twin-
ning, but it is often also clear from features such as split peaks in the
diffraction pattern itself that a crystal is not single.
The unit cell chosen for data collection (on a four-circle instrument
with a point detector) was a metrically monoclinic C-centred cell with
dimensions a = 6.255(2), b = 12.113(4), c = 15.963(6) Å, β = 91.66(6)◦,
although it was noted that γ was signiﬁcantly different from 90◦at
90.10(3)◦. After data collection it was clear from the Laue symmetry of
the data set that the true crystal system was triclinic. These data imply
Z′ = 4, which is high. In addition, the dataset showed strong pseudo-
translational symmetry of the form (h + k + 2l) = 4n, this information
being readily available in the output of SIR97 (Altomare et al., 1999), and
in a Patterson map that showed a very large peak at (1/4, 1/4, 1/2).
Non-merohedral
twinning
occurs
when
a
metrically
higher-
symmetry supercell exists. Sometimes (though quite rarely in the
author’s experience) this supercell, rather than the true cell, is identiﬁed
on indexing, and this is what occurred here. Strong pseudo-translational
effects and a high implied Z′ usually indicate that this has occurred, and
a Patterson synthesis is a useful tool to identify the correct cell.
The unit cell was transformed with the matrix

and re-reﬁned to give the triclinic setting a = 6.262, b = 6.822, c =
8.640 Å, α = 67.41◦, β = 80.92◦, γ = 62.62◦. The structure solved easily
by Patterson methods, and the carbon atoms were located in a sub-
sequent difference map. Isotropic reﬁnement converged to R = 0.068,
Rw = 0.081 with unit weights, anisotropic reﬁnement led one C atom to
become non-positive-deﬁnite. The difference map showed a very large
peak (+6.42 eÅ−3) in a chemically unreasonable position.Application of
ROTAX identiﬁed a two-fold axis along the [−1 2 0] direct lattice direc-
tion (or alternatively the (021) reciprocal lattice direction) as a potential
twin law. This is described by the matrix

This matrix can also be derived by recognising that twinning may
occur by two-fold rotation about the b-axis of the monoclinic supercell.
In terms of the triclinic axis system this symmetry operation is given by
a triple matrix product consisting of the transformation from the triclinic
to the monoclinic cell, the two-fold about the monoclinic b axis, and the

Incorporation of the twin law into the model gave an R factor of 0.031
and even allowed H atoms to be located in a difference map.
The dataset used for this example was collected using a point detector,
though this is unusual nowadays. Although twinning can be applied
to a dataset collected with an area detector and integrated as though
the crystal were single, it is almost always better to take twinning into
accountduringintegration,usingmorethanoneorientationmatrix.This
feature is available in modern integration packages such as SAINT v7,
EVALCCD and TWINSOLVE.
An extensive database of papers describing twinning has been assem-
bled by Spek and Lutz (Utrecht University, The Netherlands), and is
available on the internet at http://www.cryst.chem.uu.nl/lutz/twin/

Worked examples for several twinning problems have been assem-

The presentation of

Introduction
The ﬁnal stage of a crystal-structure analysis is its presentation. This can
occur within your own research group, as a conference poster or oral
contribution, on the internet, or as a refereed article in a journal. In each
case the requirements are different and you must tailor the presentation
tothemediumused.Aswithallcommunicationskillsthepresentationof
crystallographic results improves with practice. The reporting of struc-
tural results in crystallographic or chemical journals is usually guided
by the relevant Notes, Instructions or Guidance for Authors published in
these journals. Some journals accept only electronic submissions via a
web interface (or possibly by e-mail, FTP or on a disk) in a speciﬁc
computer-readable format. Since April 1996 Section C of Acta Crystallo-
graphica has accepted submissions only as Crystallographic Information
Files (CIF); since its launch in 2001 Section E of Acta Crystallographica has
required CIF submissions, as does the New Crystal Structures section of
Zeitschrift für Kristallographie.
Even among crystallographic journals there has been a marked trend
away from publishing primary data (co-ordinates and displacement
parameters). Greater selectivity in the choice of molecular geometry
parameters to be published is also being encouraged. Even when jour-
nals did publish extensive information it did not always convey the
structural information effectively, but now it is even more important to
include effective graphical representations of your structures. With the
spread of graphical abstracts in the contents pages of journals, a picture
that is clear and attractive can be effective in attracting the attention of
a reader browsing a hardcopy journal or an index on the web.
This section will deal ﬁrst with molecular graphics, then with the
production of tables, and ﬁnally with the different methods of delivering
your results.Archiving will also be brieﬂy mentioned. The use of the CIF
will be referred to here as necessary but will be covered in more detail
in the following chapter.

Graphics
Althoughmostobviouslyassociatedwiththeproductionofhigh-quality
views of the ﬁnal structure, molecular graphics are also used as an
aid in initial structure determination, in the interpretation of difference
electron density maps and to investigate disorder and other situations
requiring modelling. Here, we are concerned only with the ﬁrst of these,
and the main consideration is the quality of the resulting illustration in
terms of its clarity, effectiveness and information content. Early graph-
ics programs [e.g. ORTEP (Johnson, 1965, 1976)] were not interactive
and the program had to be re-run every time a new view was required.
Happily, modern programs are interactive [e.g. XP (Sheldrick, 2001),
CAMERON (Pearce et al., 1996), Mercury (Macrae et al., 2006)], allowing
continuous or stepped rotation of the molecule.
19.3
Graphics programs
The range of graphics programs is vast and it is not practical to offer a
comprehensivesurveyhere:anexcellentsourceofinformationonpoten-
tially useful programs is the CCP14 website (http://www.ccp14.ac.uk).
The majority are free (at least to academic users) or cost very little. A
major factor in your choice of program is its range of features and how
these match your needs. Are atomic displacement ellipsoids required?
Are polyhedral representations important? Do you want to display a
ball-and-stick drawing of a molecule within its van der Waals enve-
lope? A further point concerns the ability of the program to read and
write data in certain formats. For example, if you regularly need to rep-
resent the data in ﬁles from the Cambridge Structural Database it is
desirable that your program can do this without manual editing of the
input ﬁle. More generally, a program’s ability to generate plot ﬁles in
standard formats such as HPGL, PostScript, TIFF or JPEG makes it pos-
sible to incorporate these into documents or transmit them by e-mail or
FTP, or to a networked printer or plotter.
There are also commercially available programs, usually supplied
by diffractometer manufacturers as a complete package for structure
analysis, but in some cases these can be purchased separately from
the instrumentation. Such packages have the advantage of integra-
tion: for example, the solution and reﬁnement programs communicate
directly with the graphics module and the problems that can arise due
to incompatible data formats are avoided. Integration is also available
in freely available software [e.g. WinGX (Farrugia, 1999)] that provides
a graphical interface linking various programs.
The increasing power of desktop computers and the availability
of cheap laser printers with 600 dpi or higher resolution means that
publication-quality illustrations can be produced with what is now
very standard and affordable hardware. If you are considering the pur-
chase of a system for structure analysis the advice is the same as for

19.4
Underlying concepts
301
any computer-related purchase. First choose the software you need,
then select hardware you know will run it. Buy the fastest processor
(for structure solution and reﬁnement), the best screen (for viewing the
structure), and the best printer (for hardcopy output) you can afford.
Of course, if you plan to submit only electronic versions of your illus-
trations, then a printer with adequate features to allow proof checking
is all you will need.
19.4
Underlying concepts
The positions of the atoms in a structure are derived from their frac-
tional co-ordinates (x, y, z) on the crystal unit cell axes. Any graphics
program needs to read these, along with the cell parameters required
to convert to the orthogonal co-ordinate system in which the necessary
calculations will be performed. The actual orthogonal axis set (xo, yo, zo)
is arbitrary and is not important. Provided that the program accepts and
can use symmetry operators, it is necessary to read in only those atoms
comprising the crystallographic asymmetric unit: symmetry-equivalent
parts of the structure, whether for a molecule straddling a special posi-
tion or for a packing diagram, can then be generated by the program. If
the program cannot handle symmetry then all the atoms required for a
particular drawing must be generated before being input. (One reason
for doing this could be to exploit a particular drawing style not avail-
able in the graphics routine you normally use.) For the drawing itself
the program uses a separate co-ordinate system (xp, yp, zp) in which the
axes are deﬁned relative to the drawing medium (usually a screen) and
co-ordinates are generated only in order to produce the plot. The axes
of this co-ordinate system are variously deﬁned in different programs
and this represents a minor source of possible confusion if you use a
number of these.
The rotation (or view) matrix transforms the initial arbitrary view
deﬁned by the orthogonal co-ordinates (xo, yo, zo) into the plotting co-
ordinates (xp, yp, zp) corresponding to the viewing direction required.
Much of the ease of use of a program is associated with the ﬂexibility
and simplicity with which this can be done. The following options may
be available:
• direct input of the nine elements of a rotation matrix – of limited
interest;
• along cell axes or other crystallographic directions;
• with respect to molecular features such as
(i) the direction perpendicular to the mean plane through
selected (or all) atoms;
(ii) along the vector between two atoms (which need not be
bonded together).
A good general approach is to start by looking along the direction
perpendicular to the mean plane through all the non-H atoms, then

302
The presentation of results
make small rotations to reﬁne this view. It is always a good idea to
explore a range of views in case a less obvious one proves to be the best.
Most programs will allow you to do this either by continuous rotation or
in small incremental steps and, unless you have a very large structure or
a really slow computer, the default rotation speed should be acceptable.
In fact, with faster processors you may need to slow the rotation rate for
smaller molecules to prevent their spinning too rapidly.
Most drawings are composed from atoms and the bonds linking them.
The connectivity information, which tells the program which atoms to
draw bonds between, can be input explicitly along with the co-ordinates,
but it is more common for the program to calculate the connectivity
array using values for covalent or other radii appropriate to each atom.
For example, the program may consider that two atoms are bonded
if their separation is less than the sum of their covalent radii (plus a
‘fudge factor’ to ensure that slightly longer bonds are not missed): if
the stored default covalent radius for carbon is 0.70 Å and the default
‘fudge factor’ is 0.40 Å then any pair of carbon atoms will be deemed
to be bonded if they are within (0.70 + 0.70 + 0.40) = 1.80 Å of each
other. This approach is generally valid for organic compounds, where
covalent radii are well deﬁned, and many users may be unaware of the
default values simply because they never need to change them. With
organometallic and inorganic compounds more care must be taken to
ensure that all relevant interatomic distances are considered. It may be
necessary to edit the connectivity list in order to add or remove speciﬁc
entries. There will be limits on the numbers of atoms and bonds that
can be handled within any particular program: these limits may be set
within the program, perhaps at compilation, or they may be determined
by the memory available.
19.5
Drawing styles
Awide range of representations is possible and it is important to choose
appropriately. The simplest is a stick drawing, where bonds are repre-
sented by straight lines: atoms are implied by bond intersections or
termini (Fig. 19.1). Some programs use this representation for rapid
preliminary assessment of the best viewing direction as it is the least
demanding in terms of computing power (and is therefore faster). It
may also be the best way to display some large molecules, where draw-
ing atoms as spheres or ellipsoids would seriously obscure the features
behind them.
Fig. 19.1 A simple stick drawing.
Fig. 19.2 A ball-and-spoke model.
A more usual style (ball-and-spoke, Fig. 19.2) involves displaying
atoms as spheres (circles in projection) with the bonds shown as rods.
The user can select the radii of the spheres and the width of the bonds,
alter the bond style and add shading or other effects to the atoms:
Figure 19.3 shows the styles available in SHELXTL/PC (Sheldrick, 2001).
Such features can be used to emphasize features of importance, such as
the co-ordination sphere in a metal complex (Fig. 19.4). Different bond

Fig. 19.3 A range of style for atoms and
bonds.
A highly informative type of plot, colloquially referred to as an
‘ORTEP’ after its best-known implementation (Johnson, 1965, 1976),
depicts atomic displacements as displacement ellipsoids. If the program
offers a range of ellipsoid styles (e.g. those labelled –4 to –1 in Fig. 19.3)
it will be possible to represent atomic motion and (to a limited extent)
differentiate atom types in the same drawing (Fig. 19.5). The ellipsoids
can be scaled in size to represent the percentage probability of ﬁnding
within them the electrons around the atom as it vibrates: this probability
level must always be quoted in the ﬁgure caption and a value of 50%
is typical, although values such as 20% or 70% are sometimes used to
obtain reasonable views of structures with particularly high or low Uij
values, respectively. Ellipsoid plots are uniquely helpful in highlight-
ing possible problems such as disorder that may not be obvious from

the numerical Uij values, even when these are available. In fact, some
crystallographers are suspicious of ball-and-spoke plots because disor-
der and other potential problems such as incorrect atom assignments
can be hidden, by either accident or intent.
In reality, of course, molecules do not consist of balls and spokes, and
these give a poor idea of the external shape and steric requirements of a
molecule. A more realistic representation is provided by a plot such as
Fig. 19.6, where the atoms are shown as spheres having van der Waals
radii rather than much smaller, arbitrary radii. These are referred to as
‘van der Waals’ or ‘space-ﬁlling’ plots and can be used to investigate
questions such as whether a central metal atom is fully enclosed by its
ligand array or exposed and therefore more likely to undergo reaction.
The program SCHAKAL (Keller, 1989) was the ﬁrst to allow you to dis-
play a composite picture of a ball-and-stick drawing of your molecule
within its van der Waals envelope.
The molecules to be included can be selected automatically by the

program (using criteria such as distance from a reference point or a cer-
tain number of unit cells) but the default selection may not give the
best diagram. It is important to select and design packing diagrams in
order to bring out the points you wish to illustrate without introducing
unnecessary clutter. For this reason, the alternative approach of explic-
itly generating the required symmetry-equivalent molecules by the use
of symmetry operations and cell translations has much to recommend
it, even although it demands a higher level of understanding of crystal
symmetry and expertise in using the more advanced features of graph-
ics programs. Packing diagrams are frequently of poor quality and low
information content and suggest that to the maxim ‘one picture is worth
a thousand words’ should be added ‘but only if it is a good one’. If the
point of your packing diagram is merely to show that your molecules
form typical linear chains it may be more effective to convey this in
words. With some journals adopting a policy that only one illustration
of a structure is normally published, the ability to produce plots with
high information content is very useful. For example, it may be possible

in a single illustration (e.g. Fig. 19.7) rather than as two separate ones.

Fig. 19.7 A view of the environment of a reference molecule (labelled) showing the
hydrogen-bonding network. The symmetry codes need to be deﬁned in the text or caption.
The important interactions between molecules should be made as clear
as possible, typically by the use of different bond types: for example, in a
structure containing two types of hydrogen bond these could be differ-
entiated using dashed and dotted lines while normal (intramolecular)
bonds are shown by solid lines. If your ﬁgure is to be a representation
of the packing you will probably want to include the outline of the unit
cell, with the axes labelled. The labelling of symmetry-related atoms
is a slightly difﬁcult area, as the method recommended by many jour-
nals (superscripted lower-case Roman numerals) is not easily available
in many graphics programs. Fortunately, it is usually possible to work
round this with a little ingenuity.
The captions to packing diagrams are probably one of the least
exploited ways to convey structural information. They are often limited
to ‘Fig. 2: a view of the crystal packing’ when they could contain concise
information about the view direction, the most important contacts and
distances and the resulting arrangement of molecules (see Fig. 19.8).
If you work with inorganic compounds, molecular representations
may be less appropriate than polyhedral plots in which groups of atoms
form polyhedral shapes (e.g. six oxygen atoms around a metal centre
can be linked to generate an octahedron), which are shown as opaque
solid shapes. Neighbouring polyhedra are linked through their vertices,
edges or faces to build up the structure. As with packing diagrams of
molecules the selection of suitable symmetry-equivalents is important
to the effectiveness of the illustration.

Creating three-dimensional illusions
When even a simple three-dimensional structure is represented in two
dimensions there is loss of information and for more complex cases this
canbequitemisleading.Varioustechniqueshavebeendevelopedtogive
an illusion of depth on the screen or on paper, including depth cueing,
the use of perspective, bond tapering, hidden-line removal and the use
of shading and highlights. Some techniques (e.g. depth cueing) work
better on a screen than on paper because of the different background
colours used. You may ﬁnd that your graphics program has the required
parameters already optimized, but conversely it may be rewarding to
adjust these so as to produce the best effects for your example. However,
beware of overdoing effects such as perspective or bond tapering to such
an extent that the result looks ridiculous.
The traditional way to restore some depth to a ﬂat molecular plot is
by inducing stereopsis. A ‘stereo pair’ (Fig. 19.9) consists of two draw-
ings, one for each eye, with a suitable separation and slightly different

19.8

rotations. When viewed, the two drawings should merge to give a com-
plete three-dimensional effect. Such pairs are not universally effective,
as a substantial proportion of the population literally cannot see the
point of them (they cannot get the two images to merge) and the effec-
tiveness should be compared with that of a ‘mono’ plot occupying a
similar area.
19.7
The use of colour
In the last few years colour plots of crystal structures have become
much more accessible, due to the wider availability of suitable soft-
ware, the falling price of high-quality colour printers and the greater
readiness with which many journals will publish colour plots, often at
no charge but only where referees are convinced that they enhance the
presentation signiﬁcantly. The use of colour is most effective where it
illuminates features that could not otherwise be easily identiﬁed: for
example, in a polymeric structure two different metal atoms may have
similar-looking high co-ordination and it might be impossible to ﬁnd
room for adequately sized labels to differentiate them. Colour codes
can be deﬁned in the ﬁgure caption or by means of a key panel. Other
applications include colour coding of different bonds or atoms; high-
lighting of important features; colour coding of different molecules or
structural motifs such as planes in packing diagrams; and sometimes
just because colour looks wonderful on a poster. As with many good
things, there are advantages in moderation: overuse of colour can be
distracting and, if all or most of the atoms are coloured, many of the
beneﬁts of its use may be lost. Note that there are certain loose conven-
tions about atom colours that you can use to convey more information:
orange for B, black for C, light blue for N, red for O, light green for F,
brown for Si, yellow for S, a darker green for Cl, and blue, green or red
for metals. You are under no obligation to use these colours, but using
other colour schemes will confuse at least some of those looking at the
plot. Colour is probably least effective if only thin atom outlines are
coloured and the colours are weak (yellow can be particularly problem-
atic): it is better to ﬁll the atom with a strong, vibrant colour. The use of
colour opens up the possibility of using variations in intensity to convey
depth information (depth cueing).
19.8
Textual information in drawings
Although the main constituents of a molecular plot will be atoms and
bonds, it is normal (but not always essential) to include text, most com-
monly atom labels such as C1, N2 or O(3), or atom types (C/N/O).
Unless colour or shading has been used to identify atom types, a draw-
ing consisting only of chemically indistinguishable atoms and bonds
is of limited use. Make sure that any labels are of a sufﬁcient size that
they will be legible at their ﬁnal reduced size (but not so huge that they

308
The presentation of results
overwhelm the structure) and placed so that they will not overlap or
merge with any atoms or bonds. Obviously, make sure the labels refer
to the correct atoms and do not leave any ambiguity. If the graphics pro-
gram inserts them automatically, do check their placement. One decision
is whether to have parentheses in your atom labels or not [e.g. C24 or
C(24)]: the latter require more space but in some circumstances can help
to avoid confusion [e.g. using some fonts the labels C11 and Cl1 may
look very similar, while C(11) and Cl(1) are clearly distinguished]. If the
program really cannot provide the text you need, you may be able to
transfer the plot into a graphical manipulation program (e.g. Adobe Pho-
toshop,CorelPaintShopPro).Journalsnowrefusetotransferhand-written
labels onto an unlabelled copy of the plot. It is not always necessary to
label every last atom, but any atoms referred to in the text or in a table
of selected molecular geometry parameters should be identiﬁed: for
example, in a co-ordination compound labelling the central metal and
the ligand donor atoms may sufﬁce. (You can always include a fully
labelled version for the referees and possibly for deposition.) Unless
they are of special signiﬁcance (e.g. involved in H-bonding) hydrogen
atoms are not normally labelled.
Other text may be included: this can be excellent on large posters,
but where ﬁgures will undergo reduction it is likely to become hard
to read. For example, adding bond lengths and angles to a drawing
may help interpretation, but only if they are legible. To avoid cluttered
drawings, some journals expressly forbid these additions and insist that
you relegate such text to the ﬁgure caption.
19.9
Some hints for effective drawings
(a) Decide on the content: this is usually obvious for a single molecule
but there is much more choice for packing diagrams. In some cases
the hydrogen atoms make it impossible to see the rest of the structure
and can be omitted, although you may wish to include those on O or N
atoms, for example.You can sometimes reduce clutter by devices such as
drawing a single bond (in a different style) from the metal to the centroid
of a co-ordinated benzene (or cyclopentadiene) ring rather than the six
(or ﬁve) bonds to the individual carbon atoms. Sometimes you need to
omit peripheral groups, or show only the ipso carbon of an aryl ring,
before you can see the salient parts of the molecule (you must state in
the ﬁgure caption that you have done this). In some cases you may ﬁnd
it impossible to show all the important features in a single view.
(b) Invest some time looking for the best viewing direction with the
minimum of overlap, especially where important atoms are concerned.
If an atom really cannot be manoeuvred into view you could add a
phrase such as ‘C8 is wholly obscured by C7’ to the ﬁgure caption.
(c) If the important features are still not obvious, can you empha-
size them by using a distinct style for the atoms or bonds involved?
For example, you can identify a metal’s co-ordination sphere by having

19.10
Tables of results
309
a distinct style for the ligand–metal bonds. If an atom has additional
co-ordination at a greater distance, the bonds involved can be shown
differently.
(d) If colour is effective use it in moderation to draw attention to
selected features of the structure.
(e) Choose the most effective representation to convey the informa-
tion you want, bearing in mind that some journals may have speciﬁc
requirements. Displacement ellipsoid plots certainly contain a lot of
information, but it may not be the information you want to convey.
Often, the most signiﬁcant atoms appear smallest because they have
higher atomic and co-ordination numbers and consequently have lower
displacement parameters. Furthermore, there is limited scope for differ-
entiating atom types (but see Fig. 19.5), whereas a ball-and-spoke model
allows more freedom to assign atomic radii and drawing styles. Avoid
theuseofsimilarstylesfordifferentatomsasfaraspossible:forexample,
styles 7, 8 and 9 in Fig. 19.3 may look identical if the circle representing
the atom is very small (e.g. in a packing diagram) or after reduction.
(f) Avoid clutter. In some cases you have to add atom labels but it
may be possible to be selective. Omitting parentheses may help, as will
calling the only phosphorus atom in the structure P1 or even P rather
than P01 or P001. Also, you may be able to label the carbon atoms using
only their numbers (i.e. omitting the atom type and any parentheses). If
there is no room to place a label close enough to an atom to identify it
uniquely, consider placing the label some distance away with a line or
arrow pointing to the atom.
(g) Take particular care with stereo views. Do they constitute a
good view? Most importantly, are they better than a larger mono view
occupying the same space?
(h) As mentioned earlier, different criteria apply for different publica-
tion formats. Are you preparing an illustration for a journal, a thesis, a
poster, a web page, or an overhead transparency? Do not unthinkingly
transfer a ﬁgure between formats without assessing its suitability. For
example, a web graphic that is so complex that it takes a long time to
download, or that is effective only on a very high resolution monitor, is
unlikely to reach a wide audience.
(i) If you are submitting results to a journal that allows only a limited
number of views (e.g. one) of any single structure, consider whether
ﬁgures can be combined without loss of information.
(j) Be creative and have fun – this part of crystallography allows you
more choice than any other. The original ORTEP manual (Johnson, 1965)
exhorted users to improve on the standard views produced from the
program – that is now easier than ever.
19.10
Tables of results
The main tables produced at the end of the structure reﬁnement will
comprise all or most of the following:

310
The presentation of results
• fractional atomic co-ordinates (with s.u.s) – and possibly Ueq or Beq
values – for the non-H atoms: the values may be multiplied by a conve-
nient factor (given in the table heading) to give integers, or expressed
as decimal numbers;
• atomic displacement parameters – normally as Uij or Bij – with s.u.s;
• fractional atomic co-ordinates – and possibly Uiso or Biso values –
for H atoms that have not been reﬁned freely (those that have could
either be given here, with s.u.s, or moved into the ﬁrst table);
• molecular geometry parameters (bond lengths, valence angles, tor-
sion angles, intermolecular contacts, least-squares mean plane data, etc.)
– there will usually be two versions of these tables, a shorter list of
selected parameters for publication and a fuller listing (of the bonds
and angles at least) for refereeing and deposition;
• structure-factor tables.
It is also possible to tabulate crystal data and details of the structure
determination, although this is not efﬁcient in terms of space unless
you can combine data for at least two or three structures in one table.
Journals may have particular requirements, but if none are speciﬁed
(perhapsbecausethejournalrarelypublishescrystalstructures),thoseof
the journals of the Royal Society of Chemistry or theAmerican Chemical
Society seem to be widely accepted.
Journals still vary enormously in their policies on crystallographic
data – what they will publish, what they require as supplementary data
and what they will deposit. Before you start to prepare a submission,
studytherelevantinstructionsforauthors(traditionallypublishedinthe
ﬁrst issue of each year but now available on the journal’s web pages)
and follow them closely. There is, however, a strong trend towards pub-
lishing less, and many journals stopped publishing structure factors,
displacement parameters, fractional co-ordinates and full molecular
geometry (more or less in that chronological order) so that the selec-
tion of results for publication assumes greater importance (see below).
Many journals will require supplementary data in CIF format rather
than hard-copy, although for a time some remained a little suspicious
of electronic data and demanded both! Some reﬁnement programs will
produce tables of results automatically and, although these are useful,
they almost always beneﬁt from critical inspection and sometimes man-
ual adjustment of content and format, but you must exercise extreme
care not to introduce numerical or other errors.
19.11
The content of tables
19.11.1
Selected results
Selection almost always involves molecular geometry parameters as
co-ordinate data are usually complete – it is deﬁnitely not permissible
to include only the co-ordinates of what you consider the ‘interesting’
atoms. The selection of geometry parameters depends on the chemical
nature of the compound and the structural features that you want to
emphasize. These are often obvious: in a co-ordination compound you

19.11
The content of tables
311
might want to include only bonds involving a central metal and angles
subtended at it (torsion angles involving such metals may be produced
automatically but in most cases are not even worth archiving), but each
structure should be considered individually. There is no point in trying
to publish bond lengths that have been constrained during reﬁnement,
or that are unreliable because they fall in a region affected by disorder.
Extensive listing of the internal molecular geometry of typical benzene
rings, whether constrained or not, is useful only for refereeing purposes
and deposition. In many organic compounds there are no interesting
or unusual bond lengths or angles that merit publication, but a selec-
tion of torsion angles might be worth including. Mean values or ranges
may usefully supplant large numbers of individual values for similar
parameters.
19.11.2
Redundant information
Where a molecule lies on a crystallographic symmetry element, some
of its molecular geometry parameters will be equal or simply related
to each other and therefore not all need to be given. Strictly speaking,
only the unique set should be given and automatic table-generating rou-
tines may not be able to cope with this requirement. It may, however,
be sensible to include some redundant information to make the situa-
tion clearer, especially for a non-crystallographic audience. For example,
molecules of doubly bridged dinuclear metal complexes M2(μ −L)2
contain four-membered rings and these are often found lying across
crystallographic inversion centres: by symmetry, the opposite M–Lbond
lengths are equal; the two M–L–M angles are equal; the two L–M–L
angles are equal; the MLML rings are strictly planar; and adjacent pairs
of M–L–M and L–M–L angles add up to exactly 180◦. The independent
parameters are two adjacent M–Lbond lengths and one angle within the
ring. A mirror plane or a two-fold rotation axis instead of an inversion
centre will involve different relationships among the parameters, and
theserelationshipswilldependontheorientationofthesesymmetryele-
ments. Similar arguments apply to the more common situation where a
structure contains a central, often metal, atom on a special position. For
example, a four-co-ordinate palladium atom on an inversion centre has
only two independent bond lengths and one independent angle.
When tables contain atoms that are related by symmetry to those
in the original asymmetric unit, for example in order to give a bond
lengthbetweentwoatomsrelatedbyamirrorplane,theseatomsmustbe
clearly identiﬁed (e.g. C5′, C5* and C5i could be symmetry-equivalents
of atom C5) and the symmetry operations denoted by ′, * or i deﬁned in
a footnote.
19.11.3
Additional entries
Not all entries required for a molecular geometry table are necessarily
produced automatically. ‘Long’ bonds may be missed and have to be
inserted manually; short contacts such as those in hydrogen bonding

312
The presentation of results
may be calculated elsewhere but not transferred automatically. You may
even want to include non-existent ‘bonds’, for example to demonstrate
that two atoms are not close enough to interact. These values and their
s.u.s should be calculated by the reﬁnement program.
19.12
The format of tables
Journals tend to have their own requirements for tables that you must
follow or risk objections from the referees or editors. The precision to
which results are required does vary: Acta Crystallographica prefers s.u.s
in the range 2–19, while Dalton Transactions have preferred 2–14 in the
past, and some referees and editors object to s.u.s of 1. This can mean
allowing more signiﬁcant ﬁgures for the co-ordinates of heavier ele-
ments. Make sure the s.u.s look sensible and that any redundant data
(such as the Uij components for atoms on special positions other than
inversion centres) have the correct relationships between their values
(and among their s.u.s).
Ensure that the table headings are informative and correct: are the
powers of ten quoted there actually those used in the table? Are the
displacementparameterscorrectlyidentiﬁedasU orB?Aretheheadings
on the structure-factor tables correct, with any reﬂections not used in the
reﬁnement ﬂagged? If it is possible, I suggest having a compound code
or other identiﬁer on every page of tables so that structures cannot be
mixed up.
Whileoneprogrammightproducegeometricparametersbasedonthe
order in which atoms occur in the reﬁnement model, another might give
the bonds in ascending order of length, and so on. It is worth looking
at the tables to see whether this can be improved. In my opinion, the
clarity of this table of selected bond lengths (in Å):
Pd--N6
1.996(8)
Pd--N2
2.017(7)
Pd--N4
2.001(6)
Pd--N5
2.035(6)

2.008(7)

is much improved by re-ordering to give:

Hints on presentation
19.13.1
In research journals
This has mostly been covered already. Follow the instructions to authors
for submitting papers, including experimental data, tables, ﬁgures and
supplementary data. What is the policy on colour plots? The range of
formats for literature references can appear overwhelming, and if you

19.13
Hints on presentation
313
submit to a wide range of journals the use of reference management
software may be worthwhile. If you regularly use the same references
in the same format they could simply be stored in a standard ASCII or
word processor ﬁle.
19.13.2
In theses and reports
Here you have much more freedom, but you have to be careful that the
result is appropriate in style and length to the purpose in hand: a thesis
that runs to 300 pages may be acceptable but an interim report of that
size is ridiculous. Fortunately, guidelines are normally available at each
institution, so consult them before you write a word.
Don’t overdo the tables: it is seldom necessary to include structure-
factor tables, even in an appendix. However, you could put co-ordinate
data and full molecular geometry tables in appendices and retain only
selected information in the main body: this will cause less disruption to
the ﬂow of your report. These appendices do not necessarily even have
to be in hard copy: does your institution allow you to include appendices
on a CD or DVD?
You can be more generous with diagrams than when publishing in
a journal, but remember that there must always be a good reason for
including any diagram.
19.13.3
On posters
Select the most important points you want to get across. Save yourself
time by planning what you are going to present – there is no point in
producing material you don’t have space for. (Do you know the size
and orientation of the poster display area available to you?) Text must
be readable from a distance of one to two metres – you may not always
attract a crowd but the poster will make a greater impact if it can be
viewed from a comfortable distance. Keep any tabulated information
short and relevant. (Are the crystal data really needed on the poster, or is
it sufﬁcient to have these to hand in case someone asks?) Posters are one
placewherecolourcanbeexploitedtothefull,andnotonlyinﬁguresbut
in text, backing material and surrounds. It is harder to overdo it here, but
still possible! You should keep the information density relatively low:
this has the additional advantage that you will have something more to
tell those who express an interest in your work.
19.13.4
As oral presentations
Many of the points mentioned in respect of posters apply here too: avoid
high-density slides or overhead transparencies that nobody will have
time to read. Don’t be tempted to use that convenient table prepared for
publication if it consists mostly of values that are not relevant to your
lecture.

314
The presentation of results
An important function of your visual aids can be to remind you what
to say next, so they must be ‘in phase’ with your talk; they must not
let the audience see your ﬁnal results while you are still outlining the
problem! If you need to refer to the same slide or transparency at two
points in your talk, it is better to make two copies than to waste time
rummaging around for the single copy you last saw ten minutes before.
If you have just covered the material outlined on a slide and made a
point that requires the audience to absorb information from the slide,
do not immediately proceed to the next one. This point is particularly
relevant if the slide contains a crystal structure diagram.
Compose your visual aids carefully. Try to ﬁnd out the size of the
auditorium and about its facilities. Mixing slides and transparencies
requires some planning to ensure you don’t lose track of what you are
saying. If you are inexperienced it is safer to have all your visuals in
the same format if at all possible. Colour can be extremely powerful,
especially when used in bold, simple illustrations.
Do not try to cover too much material. Your audience will be less
familiar with your material than you are and it will not help if you
speak too quickly. Time your talk in advance – a practice session with a
sympathetic (and constructively critical) audience is a good idea if you
are unused to speaking in public. You should assess the composition of
your audience in advance. If they are not experts in your own ﬁeld, you
will need to give more background information so that they understand
the context, before you begin to describe your own work and its results.
Humour can be a good way to engage the audience’s attention but
it needs to be used carefully and sparingly. In some circumstances it is
wholly inappropriate. If in any doubt, avoid it.
19.13.5
On the web
The web is an excellent medium for disseminating research results but
it has its own special requirements. The speed at which data can be
transferred is limited: as faster networks are installed these are required
to carry ever more demanding applications. Combined with a constant
increase in the number of users this ensures that bandwidth is always
restricted in some way.As a result, the most effective web pages are often
those that do not involve large-scale data transfer in order to be useful.
Authors need to bear in mind that many of their potential audience may
be using modest hardware and not-so-recent software, and they must
ensure that using new features in the latest version of their web author-
ing software does not restrict this audience. On a related point, any web
page should at the very least be viewable with the most common web
browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.
It might seem obvious that any website should be designed so that
the visitor can ﬁnd information easily, yet many impressive-looking
corporate sites are so poorly structured that ﬁnding what you want
is time consuming, inefﬁcient and frustrating. If you have an extensive
website you should give serious thought to how it is constructed, and

19.14
Archiving of results
315
in particular whether your homepage allows a visitor easily to begin
navigating it. As well as hyperlinked text and graphics, web publishing
offers the possibility of illustrations that can be rotated or otherwise
moved, either according to your pre-programmed instructions or in
response to user input. This allows the visualization of complex struc-
tures and packing diagrams, for example. These features are usually
implemented by means of Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML)
extensions to your browser.
Publishing results on the web is quite different from displaying them
on a poster that you can take down at the end of a conference. Once
placed on the web, material assumes a substantial degree of permanence
as it is accessed, stored in various caches, copied to other formats and
printed. On the other hand, such results can be more ephemeral that
those printed in a journal, as it is possible to remove, modify or update
them. The copyright implications of publishing your results on the web
are often far from clear, but these are likely to become more serious with
the spread of electronic publishing. As with other forms of publication,
placing results on the web should be done only with the knowledge
and consent of all those contributing to the work, and only when the
consequences of doing so have been fully explored.
19.14
Archiving of results
Although some of the results of your structure determinations will end
up in a database after publication, you must keep your own copies of
all relevant ﬁles and other information safely and in an accessible form.
Most crystallographers know the frustration of setting out to prepare a
structure for publication, only to ﬁnd that some experimental parameter
such as the colour of the crystal or the type of diffractometer used is not
immediately available and has to be ferreted out. In the not-so-distant
past the only safe way seemed to be to keep every piece of hard-copy out-
put ever generated for a structure, but now archiving and transmission
tools such as the CIF format allow this to be done much more concisely.
The ‘paperless ofﬁce’ once promised by the advocates of information
technology may have proved illusory elsewhere, but in the modern crys-
tallography laboratory it has largely materialized. The CIF and its uses
are described in detail in the next chapter.
When archiving data the main considerations are safety and accessi-
bility. To address the ﬁrst, you need to keep backup copies of your ﬁles,
possibly on tape, including a set that will survive ﬁre, ﬂood and theft
at your workplace. This could involve a ﬁreproof safe, but keeping a
backup in a safe place at home is probably as reliable. Keeping all the
ﬁles for one structure together aids organisation, and utilities such as
PKZIP, WinZIP, PowerArchiver or WinRAR allow these to be compressed
within a single archive ﬁle, with the bonus of a considerable saving on
disk space. For accessibility, you need some form of indexing so that the
structures you require can be quickly and uniquely identiﬁed. Before

316
The presentation of results
starting to rely on it, you must check the backup procedure works by
restoring some typical ﬁles from the archive. Most backup devices come
not only with software to drive them but also with documentation that
includes advice on how to implement a suitable and effective backup
regime. This documentation should include explanations of how to use
both full and incremental backups, the latter referring to the procedure
whereby only those ﬁles that have changed since the last backup are
transferred to the archive.
There are two distinct aspects to backing up a particular computer.
The ﬁrst requires an archive medium capacious enough to allow you
to back up everything on that computer, including operating system,
applications and data. This would allow you to re-create your working
environment in the event of the computer or its hard disk failing totally,
and requires a backup medium with the same capacity as your hard disk.
The best solution used to be some kind of tape drive, and models with
capacities of up to many tens of gigabytes are currently available, but
there is an increasing view that the only effective, convenient backup
medium for a hard disk is another hard drive. An additional level of
security could be provided by backing up your working hard disk to
another physical hard disk (not a different logical drive on the same disk)
on the computer. Such a backup will survive any failure of the working
disk, and most disasters short of theft or outright destruction of your
computer. If the computer is automatically backed up over a network
you may be content to rely on this, but make sure that the frequency of
backup is appropriate and that the backup ﬁles are accessible. Remem-
ber to update the backup ﬁles whenever you make signiﬁcant changes
to the computer, for example after a major new application has been
installed and conﬁgured.
The second aspect is the regular backup of new data and the media
that can be used will depend on the volume of these data. The essential
ﬁles to be kept at the end of a structure analysis may well amount to only
a few hundred kilobytes after compression and several structures could
be archived on a standard 3.5” ﬂoppy disk. In contrast, the frames for
one data collection using an area-detector diffractometer occupy several
hundred Mbytes and, while archiving to CD-ROM is a possibility, each
CD will hold only two or three sets of frames at most. However, with
DVD writers costing from less than £50 per unit, and each disk holding
15–40 sets, this seems a sensible backup medium. Two rival formats
(Blu-ray and HD DVD, see Table 19.1) were in competition to succeed
DVD, but in 2008 it became clear that Blu-ray had won. For data transfer,
solid-state drives are now available with sufﬁcient capacities (e.g. 8 Gb)
and have the advantage of simplicity.
When you are planning a backup regime, ease of use is an important
factor. You are unlikely to regularly use any method that is cumbersome
or time consuming.Archive media can change and develop as rapidly as
other aspects of computer hardware, and factors such as capacity, cost,
convenience and durability need to be considered. It is not necessarily
best to adopt the latest technology: in fact it may be safer to select one

The crystallographic
information ﬁle (CIF)
Alexander Blake
20.1
Introduction
The crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF) is an archive ﬁle for the trans-
mission of crystallographic data: this transfer can be between different
laboratories or computer programs, or to a journal or database. The ﬁle
is free-format, ﬂexible and designed to be read by both computer pro-
grams and humans (the latter require a little practice at the start). The
speciﬁcation of the CIF standard has been published and the same article
providesinformationonitsevolution(Hall etal.,1991).Itisbasedaround
the self-deﬁning text archive and retrieval (STAR) procedure (Hall,
1991), and consists of data names and the corresponding data items with
a loop facility to handle repeated items such as the author/address list or
the fractional co-ordinates. The format is extensible, so that data names
covering new developments such as area detectors can easily be accom-
modated. However, once a data name is included it is never removed,
otherwise portions of those archives written in the interim would be
undeﬁned.
20.2
Basics
The CIF is an ASCII ﬁle, such that only the following characters are
allowed:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
!@#$%ˆ&*()_+{}:"˜<>?|\-=[];’‘,/.
Any others that you may want to include in a manuscript (such
as Å,◦, é, ø, subscripts and superscripts, Greek letters, mathemati-
cal symbols such as ±, and chemical multiple bonds) require spe-
cial codes that are detailed in the Notes for Authors for Acta Crys-
tallographica, Section C. Do not attempt to show italicized, bold or
underlined text (e.g. in space group symbols) as these attributes
319

320
The crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF)
should be added automatically. Many data names have implicit units
(e.g. Å for _cell_length_a; Å3 for _cell_volume; minutes for
_diffrn_standards_interval_time) and these units must not be
appended; thus
_cell_volume
2367.5(8)
is correct but
_cell_volume
2367.5(8)\%Aˆ3ˆ
is not.
If you prepare your CIF using a word processor rather than a text
editor you must make sure that the output ﬁle is ASCII, that there
are no (hidden?) embedded codes and that lines do not exceed 80
characters in length. If you are exporting an ASCII ﬁle from a word
processor it is best to have used a large ﬁxed font (e.g. Courier 12
point or larger) so that any lines that are part of blocks of text do
not overrun upon conversion. Do not include any non-ASCII char-
acters in the word processor ﬁle as these will be lost or corrupted
upon writing the ASCII ﬁle and, even if they survived unchanged,
the CIF processing software will not recognize them correctly. It is
much safer to use a dedicated CIF editor such as enCIFer (Allen
et al., 2004; see http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/free_services/encifer/
for the enCIFer home page) or publCIF (Westrip, 2009; see http://
journals.iucr.org/services/cif/publcif), because these programs also
check the CIF for syntax errors and whether the data names and items
correspond to valid CIF dictionary entries. EnCIFer can also display the
structure graphically.
The following CIF terminology is used.
text string
a string of characters delimited by blanks, quotes, or
semi-colons (;) as the ﬁrst character on the line
data name
a text string starting with an underline (_) character
data item
a text string not starting with an underline, but preceded
by a data name
data loop
a list of data names, preceded by _loop and followed by a
repeated list of data items
data block
a collection of data names and data items (which may be
looped) preceded by a data_code statement and terminated
by another data_ statement or the end of the ﬁle. A data
name may only occur once within any one data block.
data ﬁle
a collection of data blocks: no two data block codes may
have the same name
CIF data name and data block code deﬁnitions are restricted to a max-
imum of 76 characters, but their hierarchical construction and careful
design mean that they are largely self-explanatory: e.g.

_computing_structure_solution.
The term ‘CIF’ has acquired a range of informal meanings: it is used to
describe the format, the data output by a control or reﬁnement program,
as well as the data ﬁle (comprising two or more data blocks) submitted
as a manuscript for electronic publication.
20.3
Uses of CIF
(a) Your own local archive. A CIF produced by a reﬁnement program
upon convergence of your structure can be edited and augmented
so that all the relevant results and details of procedures can be
stored. As with other uses, the degree of manual editing required
will depend on the extent to which your data collection and
reduction programs produce relevant output in CIF format.
(b) A standard method of transmitting data between crystallographic
programs (an increasing number of which read ﬁles in CIF format)
or to colleagues in other laboratories.
(c) An efﬁcient method of providing supplementary data for papers
containing crystal-structure determinations.
(d) A standard route for deposition into structural databases.
(e) A route to standard printed tables (e.g. via the SHELXL ancillary
program CIFTAB or XCIF).
(f) Direct electronic submission of manuscripts to journals such
as Sections C and E of Acta Crystallographica or Zeitschrift für
Kristallographie. The required data ﬁle will consist of a num-
ber of data blocks. One, perhaps called data_global and
possibly prepared by manual editing of a template, will con-
tain author contact information, submission information, an
author/afﬁliation/address list, a title, a synopsis, an abstract, a
comment (discussion) section, experimental details, references,
ﬁgure captions and acknowledgements. This block will be fol-
lowed by one data block for each structure to be included, perhaps
called data_compound1, data_compound2, etc.
20.4
Some properties of the CIF format
(a) Within any data block, the ordering of the associated pairs of
data names and data items is not important, as ﬁle integrity does
not depend on ﬁnding these in a particular sequence. However,
humanreaderswillﬁnditeasiertoreadtheCIFiftheyaregrouped
logically. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the ordering of
the data blocks.

The crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF)
(b) Each data name must have its corresponding data item, but the
latter need not contain real information. Sometimes a placeholder
such as ? or . is used as in
_chemical_name_common ?
These placeholders are used within loop structures when some
data items are not relevant to every line of the loop. In the follow-
ing example the fourth data name in the loop applies only in the
second line.

Some items are mandatory for certain CIF applications: for exam-
ple, the list of data items required for a submission to Acta
Crystallographica Sections C and E is given in these journals’ Notes
for Authors.
(c) Certain data items can be speciﬁed as standard codes and these
must be used wherever possible. For example, there are now seven
standard codes for the treatment of H atoms during reﬁnement
associated with the data name
_refine_ls_hydrogen_treatment
and these include refall (all H parameters reﬁned) and constr
(e.g. a riding model). If the standard codes are inappropriate or
inadequate then a fuller explanation can be given as part of an
experimental section.
(d) There are now a large number of ancillary programs available for
preparing, checking, manipulating and extracting CIF data. Some
of these will be mentioned later and others are given on the IUCr
website (www.iucr.org).
(e) Additional tables can be created within the CIF format. The
most common of these contain hydrogen-bonding parameters
and there are now standard geom_hbond_ data items to facil-
itate their input. However, it is possible to set up tables of
non-standard parameters by deﬁning additional data items; the
following example sets up a comparison table of molecular
geometry parameters.

Some practicalities
20.5.1
Strings
The correct handling of strings throughout the CIF is vital. There are
three ways to supply the information in these and examples of each
follow.

324
The crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF)
(a) Delimitation by blanks – the data item is effectively a word or a
number without any spaces within it. The data item cannot extend
beyond the end of a line. Examples are:
_publ_contact_author_email
J.O-Groats@north.ac.uk
_cell_length_a
10.446(3)
_diffrn_standards_number
3
Note that
J. O-Groats@north.ac.uk
and
10.446 (3)
are not allowed because they contain spaces.
(b) Delimitation by quotation marks (single or double) – the data item
may now contain spaces. It is limited to one line, but it can be on
the line following the data name if required. For example:
_exptl_crystal_density_method
’not measured’
_chemical_formula_moiety ’C12 H24 S6 Cu 2+, 2(P F6 -)’
_publ_section_acknowledgements
"We thank EPSRC for support (to J.O’G.)."
(c) Delimitation by semi-colons as the ﬁrst character in a line – this
is necessary for blocks of text that exceed one line in length. For
example:
_publ_section_abstract
;
In the title compound C˜12˜H˜22˜O˜7˜, (1), molecules
occur exclusively as the cis geometric isomer and are
linked by hydrogen bonding to form helices running
parallel to the crystallographic c direction.
;
20.5.2
Text
(a) When preparing a data ﬁle for publication, most effort will be
devoted to the textual sections, in particular _publ_section_
abstract, _publ_section_comment and _publ_section_
references. Much of this may appear as normal text, but
certain special character codes are commonly required. Sub-
scripted and superscripted text is delimited by pairs of tilde (∼)
and caret (ˆ) characters, respectively; for example, if you want
[Cu(H2O)4]2+ to appear in your paper, you need to enter it
as [Cu(H∼2∼O)∼4∼]ˆ2+ˆ. Note that these must not be used
in _chemical_formula_moiety, etc. In discussing molecular
geometry you will need the symbols Å and ◦, the codes for which
are \%A and \% (not ˆoˆ), respectively. You will occasionally need

20.5
Some practicalities
325
other codes – see the appropriate page in the IUCr journals website
for the full list.
(b) Certain trivial errors occur frequently and can cause a great deal
of annoyance because the CIF processing software does exactly
what you tell it to, rather than what you want. CIF checking
software (see below) will strive to return helpful reports on the
location of errors in the data ﬁle, but sometimes the results of the
fault are so pervasive, or appear so far removed from the orig-
inal error, that a manual search is necessary. Some of the most
common and irritating faults arise from the simplest of causes,
such as the failure to have matching subscript and superscript
codes: forgetting to ‘switch off’ these features means that subse-
quent information in the CIF is misinterpreted. Another frequent
mistake is not terminating text strings or text blocks correctly.
(c) Within a CIF, the selection of molecular geometry parameters for
publication depends on the setting of the _geom_type_publ_
flag for each parameter, where type is bond, angle or
torsion. Setting a ﬂag to Yes (or y) indicates that the corre-
sponding parameter should be published: anything else (No, n or
?, for example) means that it will not. Make sure that this editing
does not disrupt the number of data items (including placehold-
ers), as doing so will create problems for any program attempting
to read the CIF.
20.5.3
Checking the CIF
Before a CIF is used, for whatever purpose, it is essential to sub-
mit it for automated checking. The checkCIF procedure tests for valid
CIF data names, correct syntax, missing IUCr Journals Commission
requirements, consistency of crystal data, correct space group, unusual
atomic displacement parameter values, completeness of diffraction
data, etc. It is available through the IUCr website (www.iucr.org), and
the current version returns reports within a few seconds. Depending on
the intended purpose of the CIF, failure to satisfy certain of these tests
(e.g. missing Journals Commission requirements) may not be impor-
tant as they are designed primarily as a check on a data ﬁle before
electronic submission to Acta Crystallographica. If you have a way of
reading PDF ﬁles, such as the free program Adobe Reader, you should
take advantage of another utility: printCIF, also available through the
IUCr website, returns a preprint of your paper for checking. This is
valuable because some errors, especially formatting ones, may not be
detected by checkCIF but they are usually horribly obvious on a preprint.
The IUCr program publCIF (Westrip, 2009) includes the same function-
ality as printCIF but, like enCIFer, it is interactive, offering an HTML
representation of the required CIF publication data. You can also carry
out useful additional checks with programs such as PLATON (Spek,
2003) running on your own computer: these include not only numerical
checks but also visual checks of conformation, ellipsoid plots and other

326
The crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF)
features. It is worthwhile checking whether chemically equivalent geo-
metric parameters are equal within the relevant standard uncertainty
limits; for example, in a tertiary butyl substituent are all three C–CH3
bond distances close to 1.52 Å, and is there tetrahedral geometry around
the central carbon atom? If not, you should check for disorder or other
problems.

Crystallographic
databases
Jacqueline Cole
21.1
What is a database?
A database is a collection of related data along with tools for amending,
updating and adding records and selectively extracting information.
Crystallographic databases generally contain basic crystallographic
data (unit cell dimensions, space group, atomic co-ordinates and per-
haps atomic displacement parameters) and may also carry derived
information on connectivity or atom and bond properties. Bibliographic
information such as author names, the journal and year of publication
will be stored. A compound’s formula and systematic name, abso-
lute conﬁguration, polymorphic form and pharmaceutical or biological
activity may be indicated where applicable. Experimental details such
as the temperature and radiation used in the experiment may be avail-
able. Entries may carry ﬂags indicating the level of precision for each
structure, the presence of disorder, and there may even be comments
about problems or unresolved queries regarding the structure. The exact
contents depend on the database.
21.2
What types of search are possible?
Depending on the database, it may be possible to carry out searches
based on a structure fragment, compound name, compound formula,
compound properties, experimental conditions, space group, unit cell
dimensions or bibliographic criteria – or some combination of these.
For molecular compounds the ability to sketch or deﬁne a structure
fragment whose occurrence within the database can then be probed is a
powerful and intuitive tool for chemists. Whereas details of the internal
structure of a database are not generally of interest, a good knowledge
of the search facilities available is essential in order to best exploit the
stored information.
327

328
Crystallographic databases
21.3
What information can you get out?
• bibliographic data,
• space group and cell dimensions,
• atomic co-ordinates,
• atomic displacement parameters (maybe),
• molecular geometry parameters,
• intermolecular geometry parameters,
• analyses of the above, etc.
21.4
What can you use databases for?
• ﬁnding out what has been done before – surveying the ﬁeld,
• determining if speciﬁc compounds have been reported,
• checking if a unit cell is known – diagnostic for the phase,
• obtaining parameters to assist structure solution or reﬁnement
(e.g. geometrical restraints),
• validation and comparison of your structure against published
ones,
• deriving typical bonds lengths or other parameters,
• as a source of parameters for calculations or simulations,
• as a research tool for structure correlation, identifying trends or
relationships, data mining,
• etc.
21.5
What are the limitations?
You need to be aware that there can be a considerable delay between
the appearance of a structure in the literature and its inclusion in a
database, although the availability of data in standard electronic format
should reduce this delay. Such delays may result from a number of fac-
tors; perhaps the required data have not been (automatically) sent to the
database, or database updates may not be distributed frequently. Struc-
tures that have been determined but neither published nor deposited
will obviously not be included, but structures that form part of confer-
ence proceedings, including poster presentations, may be represented
only by very basic data. For these reasons you should also check non-
crystallographic databases such as Chemical Abstracts, which are more
current (but may contain little or no crystallographic data).

CuSO4 · 5H2O; metals or their alloys; or macromolecular structures such
as proteins or nucleic acids. The ConQuest (and earlier Quest) software
has been developed for the search, retrieval, display and analysis of CSD
information and its particular strength is the ability to search for struc-
tures on the basis of a chemical diagram, although text-based searches
are also possible (Fig. 21.1). At the beginning of 2009 the CSD con-
tained crystal structure data for over 460 000 organic and organometallic
compounds. The CSD is updated through a full release every year,
with approximately quarterly interim updates via the internet for reg-
istered users. There are a number of related programs such as Vista
(graphical display of results, statistical analysis), Isostar (CSD-derived
library of non-bonded contacts), Mogul (library of molecular geome-
tries) and Mercury (advanced graphical visualization of structures). See
http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk for further details.
The Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) provides fast
retrieval of structural and bibliographic information, allows logical
manipulation of retrieved material and display of results, and is
complementary to the CSD (Fig. 21.2). By late 2008, the ICSD contained
over 108 000 entries. It is searchable by using either a command-line or

a web interface and contains two types of data: (1) bibliographic infor-
mation about each entry, giving authors, journal reference, compound
name, formula, mineral name (if any), etc.; (2) numeric information from
the crystal structure analysis (if it is available), giving cell parameters,
spacegroup,atomicco-ordinatesanddisplacementparameters.Because
of the nature of the structures, connectivity searching is not appropriate.
See http://cds.dl.ac.uk/cds/datasets/crys/icsd/llicsd.html for further infor-
mation.
The Metals Data File or CrystMet (MDF) provides fast retrieval of
structural and bibliographic information for metals and alloys. For
searching, the MDF uses a set of instructions similar to ICSD. It con-
tains two types of data: (1) bibliographic information about each entry,
giving authors, journal reference, compound name, formula, mineral
name (if any) etc.; (2) numeric data from the crystal structure analysis (if
it is available), giving cell parameters, space group, atomic co-ordinates
and displacement parameters. The MDF currently contains around
100 000 entries for metals, alloys and intermetallics.

mation.

CDIF was an online retrieval package using the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST, Washington) Crystal Data Identiﬁca-
tion File. Entries in this ﬁle comprised unit cell data for some 237 000
organic, inorganic and metal crystal structures, some 72 000 of which
did not appear in any other database. Each entry gave details of cell
dimensions, crystal class, name and formula of the substance, and jour-
nal reference. CDIF has been superseded by the Daresbury CrystalWeb
interface that allows searches of the CSD, the ICSD, CrystMet and CDIF
on the basis of bibliographic, unit cell, reduced cell, formula, database
code or combined queries.
See http://cds.dl.ac.uk/cweb/ for information on CrystalWeb.
The Protein DataBank (PDB) contains bibliographic and co-ordinate
details for proteins and other biological macromolecules. At the begin-
ning of 2009, the PDB contained over 56 000 entries, of which most
were derived from X-ray studies and others from NMR work. See
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ for further information. There is also a compan-
ion nucleic acid database.
With the exception of the PDB, these databases are available free of
charge to UK academic researchers through the Chemical Database Ser-
vice (CDS) at STFC Daresbury Laboratory. The CDS homepage is at
http://cds.dl.ac.uk/. This Service has also provided access to a range of
databases for organic chemistry, physical chemistry and spectroscopy
but some of these services have been discontinued.Access to CSD, ICSD
and DETHERM (a thermophysical properties database) is currently
guaranteed until 2011. See http://cds.dl.ac.uk for up-to-date information.

X-ray and neutron
sources
William Clegg
22.1
Introduction
The main topic of this book is the analysis of crystal structures using
diffraction of X-rays by single crystals. Most such experiments are
carried out in local research laboratories, either in Universities or in
industry, and make use of commercial X-ray diffractometers that are
equipped with ‘X-ray tubes’ of various designs. These involve the gen-
eration of X-rays by directing fast-moving beams of electrons at metal
targets, and typically consume electrical power in the range from tens
of watts to tens of kilowatts.
Much higher X-ray intensities are available from large-scale national
and international storage-ring facilities (more commonly, if strictly
incorrectly, known as synchrotron facilities), and there are ways other
than the enhanced intensity in which the properties of these X-rays differ
from those from laboratory X-ray tubes.
Furthermore, diffraction from crystals can occur with fast-moving
beamsofsubatomicparticles,particularlyneutronsandelectrons,which
have wave properties and interact with the investigated crystalline
material on quite different physical bases from X-rays, giving diffraction
patterns with different information content.
In this chapter we consider the conventional and synchrotron sources
of X-rays and their different properties and uses, then we discuss the
application of neutron diffraction. Electron diffraction by solids, because
it involves a much stronger interaction with the sample, is normally
conﬁned to thin specimens and surfaces, and it ﬁnds wide application
in electron microscopy. It, and the use of electrons for diffraction by gas
samples, lie outside the scope of this text, and will not be considered.
22.2
Laboratory X-ray sources
Most laboratory X-ray diffractometers, whether ﬁtted with serial detec-
tors or area detectors, operate with a conventional sealed X-ray tube, the
333

basic design of which has not changed for a long time, though ceramic
insulating materials are increasingly being used instead of glass. The
principle of operation of an X-ray tube is simple (Fig. 22.1). Electrons
are generated in a vacuum by passing an electric current through a wire
ﬁlament and are accelerated to a high velocity by an electric poten-
tial of tens of thousands of volts across a space of a few millimetres.
The ﬁlament is held at a large negative potential and the electrons are
attracted to an earthed and water-cooled metal block, where they are
brought to an abrupt halt. Most of the kinetic energy of the electrons
is converted to heat and carried away in the cooling water, but a small
proportion generates X-rays by interaction with the atoms in the metal
target. Some of the interactions produce a broad range of wavelengths of
X-rays, with a minimum wavelength (maximum photon energy) set by
the kinetic energy of the electrons. For our purposes, however, the most
important process is the ionization of an electron from a core orbital,
followed by relaxation of an electron from a higher orbital to ﬁll the
vacancy. This electron transition leads to loss of excess energy by radi-
ation, and the emitted radiation, with a deﬁnite wavelength, is in the
X-ray region of the spectrum. Several different transitions are possi-
ble, so a number of intense sharp maxima (in wavelength terms) are
superimposed on the broad output of the overall spectrum of radiation
produced (Fig. 22.2).

Fig. 22.2 The spectrum of X-rays gener-
ated by a sealed tube.
Since we use monochromatic X-rays for most purposes, one particular
intense line of the output spectrum is selected and the rest discarded.
The usual way of achieving this is to use diffraction itself: the X-rays
emerging from a thin beryllium window in the X-ray tube are passed
through a single crystal of a strongly diffracting material set at an appro-
priate angle. The (002) reﬂection of graphite is very widely used, with
a 2θ angle of just over 12◦for Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å, the
most intense line from a target consisting of molybdenum metal) and
about 26.5◦for Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å, from a copper target).
All other wavelengths pass undeﬂected through the monochromator
crystal, leaving a single wavelength for the diffraction experiment.
Various developments of the basic X-ray tube produce higher inten-
sities. The main limitation is the amount of heat produced, which can
damage or even melt the target if it is excessive. One way to reduce the
heat loading, and hence allow larger electron beam currents and more
intense X-rays, is to keep the target moving in its own plane by rotating
it, so that the target spot is constantly replaced. Rotating-anode sources
require continuous evacuation because of the moving parts, and their
use involves much more maintenance as well as higher energy con-
sumption than sealed tubes. The increase in intensity can be up to about
a factor of ten.
Another approach is to collect and concentrate more of the X-rays
generated instead of just the narrow beam taken from a standard tube.
Recent technological advances have produced extremely well polished
mirrors giving glancing-angle total reﬂection of X-rays, and devices
consisting of variable-thickness layers of materials with different crystal

latticespacingstogiveafocusingeffectthroughdiffraction(alsoreferred
to, not strictly correctly, as mirrors). X-rays can also be concentrated
and focused through glass capillaries. Each of these devices can give
a signiﬁcant increase in intensity from a suitable X-ray tube (whether
sealed or rotating anode). Some of them can be combined with X-ray
tubes in which the electron beam is magnetically focused to give a very
small target spot, reducing heat loading, and these are known as micro-
focus tubes. They typically operate with power consumption of tens of
watts, compared with 1–3 kW for conventional sealed tubes and 5–30
kW for rotating-anode sources. Overall, the developments in X-ray gen-
eration and focusing have led to increases of 1–2 orders of magnitude
for laboratory X-ray sources.
22.3
Synchrotron X-ray sources
When moving charged particles are deﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld, they
emit electromagnetic radiation and hence lose energy. The radiation
wavelength depends on the particles (charge, mass and velocity) and
on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. This effect was found to occur in syn-
chrotrons, particle accelerators with a closed path (pseudo-circular,
actually polygonal resulting from an array of magnets), and is an unde-
sirable feature in the orginal primary purpose of such devices. However,
the radiation has special properties and can be exploited for diffraction,
spectroscopy and other uses. The ﬁrst such experiments were carried
out around 1970 on the NINA accelerator at Daresbury, UK, and gave
rise to the term ‘ﬁrst-generation’ synchrotron radiation source, referring
to parasitic use of a synchrotron that was designed for other purposes.
Such a radiation source is far from ideal, being erratic and unstable
through rapid acceleration, deceleration and deliberate collisions of the
particles; a storage ring, with a stable circulating particle beam, is much
better suited as a reliable source of electromagnetic radiation. Once the
usefulness of synchrotron radiation (SR) had been established, storage
rings were designed and built, dedicated to the production of SR, with
the aim of stability in terms of intensity, position and direction of the
radiated beams. These are called second-generation SR sources, and ini-
tially the SR was generated exclusively by the bending magnets that
keep the particles in their circulating motion. The energy of the parti-
cles is maintained by the inclusion of microwave cavities at one or more
positions in the ring, compensating for the energy loss associated with
SR emission. The ﬁrst second-generation SR source was the UK Syn-
chrotron Radiation Source (SRS), built at Daresbury to replace NINA,
and operational from 1980 to 2008.
Even greater intensity (and some other useful properties) can be
achieved by putting more complex arrays of magnets in the straight
sections between bending magnets. These ‘insertion devices’ include
wigglers and undulators, which induce a series of sideways oscillations
in the particle beam path; each wiggle generates SR and the individual

336

contributions combine in different ways depending on the precise
arrangements of the magnets. Some insertion devices were added to
second-generation sources such as SRS, but they provide the main SR
output of third-generation sources, the bending magnets of which can
also be used, of course. Most SR sources now operational are of this
third generation, including Diamond (Fig. 22.3), the UK replacement
for SRS, many other national facilities, and international sources such as
the European Synchrotron Radiation Source (ESRF) in Grenoble, France.
The fourth generation of SR sources, currently under development, is
based on the free-electron laser.
The precise properties of SR depend on a combination of factors,
including
(a) the energy of the stored particle beam (several GeV, with essen-
tially the speed of light, resulting in relativistic behaviour);
(b) the size of the storage ring, the number of bending magnets, and
details of other magnetic components for controlling and focusing
the particle beam;
(c) the types and speciﬁcations of insertion devices;
(d) the structure of the particle beam, which usually consists of dis-
crete bunches rather than a continuous stream, giving rise to a
rapid pulse behaviour of the SR output;
(e) the way in which beam-current loss (inevitable through collisions,
imperfect vacuum and other effects) is dealt with, in various ‘top-
up’ and reﬁll operations;

mators and mirrors for wavelength selection, harmonic rejection
and focusing.

Synchrotron X-ray sources

SR is produced tangentially every time the particle beam changes
direction in bending magnets or insertion devices (Fig. 22.4). As a result
of relativity, it is strongly concentrated in a single forward direction, giv-
ing a very highly collimated beam of radiation. It is almost completely
polarized in the plane of the storage ring, has a very high intensity
compared with conventional X-ray sources, and covers a continuous
wide spectrum from infrared to hard X-rays (undulators give a jagged
stepped X-ray spectrum), with a maximum photon energy (minimum
wavelength) dictated by the operating conditions. For the purposes of
X-ray crystallography, we can think of a synchrotron storage ring in sim-
ple terms as a large device that exploits relativity to convert microwave
energy into X-rays by a massive doppler shift. Any wavelength can
be selected from the broad spectrum by a monochromator, or the con-
tinuous ‘white’ X-ray spectrum can be used for the Laue diffraction
technique, which is not discussed in this book.

The very high intensity, several orders of magnitude greater than
from conventional sources, is the most obvious and desirable feature
of SR X-rays. It allows diffraction patterns to be measured quickly, even
from tiny crystals (down to micrometre dimensions, depending on the
chemical composition and crystal quality of the sample), or from other
samples giving relatively weak diffraction as a result of structural faults
such as disorder. Obviously this is useful when larger single crystals
can not be obtained, and individual powder grains can be treated as
single crystals, though the requirements of crystal mounting and diffrac-
tometer mechanical precision are demanding; it is also an advantage
for chemically unstable and sensitive materials, and makes it possible
(in combination with the pulsed nature of SR and the use of lasers) to
investigate short-lived excited states.
The advantages of the high intensity of SR are further enhanced
by the high degree of collimation, which makes individual reﬂections
from single-crystal samples stand out more clearly from the background
because of their sharper proﬁles; these are dictated largely by the sam-
ple quality rather than a non-parallel incident X-ray beam. This can
also help in the spatial resolution of reﬂections from a sample with a
large unit cell, or if a short wavelength is selected. A short wavelength
gives access to higher-resolution data for charge-density studies, can
reduce some systematic errors such as absorption and extinction, and
can allow more of the diffraction pattern to be measured from a sample
in a diamond anvil high-pressure cell or other special environment. Con-
versely, a longer wavelength spreads out a dense diffraction pattern for
a large structure. A particular wavelength might also be chosen to min-
imize or to maximize special effects such as anomalous scattering. Bent
monochromators and mirrors (giving total external reﬂection of X-rays
at a glancing angle) can be used to focus and concentrate the available
X-rays to match the sample size, so that the high ﬂux is more effectively
usedashighbrilliance(ﬂuxinagivencross-sectionalareaorsolidangle).
The pulsed nature of SR is exploited in special time-resolved stud-
ies, but is not relevant to most crystallographic users. The polarization

338
X-ray and neutron sources
properties mean that diffractometers have to be operated ‘on their side’,
with diffraction measured in a vertical rather than a horizontal plane,
making synchrotron installations look rather strange compared with
standard laboratory setups.
SR sources are large national and international facilities providing
equipment and support for a wide range of scattering, spectroscopy,
imaging and other applications. Modes of access vary, but usually
include some form of peer-reviewed application process on a regular
basis (often twice per year), leading to use that is ‘free at the point of
access’ to successful academic research groups, and charged for com-
mercial users. There may be service modes of operation, or users may
have to carry out their own experiments after appropriate training for
safety and other aspects.
Structure determination with SR single-crystal diffraction facilities
has been particularly important in certain research areas where small
crystals and other weakly scattering samples frequently occur. These
include microporous materials, often synthesized solvothermally; poly-
meric co-ordination networks; other supramolecular assemblies with
weakintermolecularinteractions; pharmaceuticals; pigments; low-yield
products of reactions; and structures with several molecules in the
asymmetric unit (Z′ > 1).
Aparticularproblemfrequentlyencounteredisofcrystalsthatgrowto
a reasonable size in one or two dimensions, but form only very thin nee-
dles or plates with a total volume, and hence scattering power, below
acceptable levels for laboratory study. In addition, there are applica-
tions where it is an advantage to select as small a crystal as possible to
avoid other problems (e.g. in high-pressure studies, or to reduce absorp-
tion and extinction effects). The use of synchrotron radiation opens up
the possibility of determining a complete structure from a single pow-
der grain and thus investigating the homogeneity of a microcrystalline
sample.
Some materials form only very small crystals because of poor crys-
tallinity, but even large crystals may be of inferior quality, with a large
mosaic spread, and so give broad and weak reﬂections. Synchrotron
radiation can give adequate diffracted intensities, and the low intrin-
sic beam divergence also minimizes the breadth of observed reﬂections.
Weakdiffractionmaybecausedparticularlybyvarioustypesofdisorder
in the structure, and cooling of the sample is also important.Asomewhat
related topic is the study of substructure/superstructure relationships.
Resolution of such structures depends critically on the measurement
of very weak reﬂections that alone distinguish different possible space
groups.
For unstable species and time-resolved studies, very high inten-
sity means that data can be collected at maximum speed while still
achieving an acceptable precision of measurement. The combination of
synchrotron radiation and high-speed area detectors provides a means
of doing this type of experiment. Rapid data collection is essential for
unstable samples, but can also be very useful in collecting multiple data

sets for a sample under different conditions of temperature or pressure
in order to investigate the effects of varying these conditions. It may be
possible to follow solid-state reactions, where the reactant and product
have related structures and crystal integrity is maintained in the reac-
tion; these may include phase transitions, polymerization, and reactions
related to catalysis.
Although SR facilities are expensive to build and operate, their use in
structure determination can be very cost effective, with rapid through-
put of samples, data and results. Typical use of station 9.8 at Daresbury
SRS (ﬁnally closed in August 2008 after about 12 years of operation) by
the UK National Crystallography Service has given around 12–15 full
data sets in each 24-hour period, investigating samples that had been
previously screened and found to be beyond the capabilities of even the
most powerful conventional laboratory sources, and results have been
published in leading international journals. Even higher productivity is
expected at Diamond beamline I19.

(2000), and for information on the use of SR in the UK National

22.4
Neutron sources
X-rays are used for crystal-structure determination because they have
a wavelength comparable to the size of molecules and their separation
in solids, so they give measurable diffraction effects from crystals. By
deﬁnition, they are the only region of the electromagnetic spectrum with
an appropriate wavelength. However, a beam of neutrons can have a
similar associated wavelength, related to its velocity v and momentum
mv (where m is the neutron mass) by λ = h/mv. Such neutrons may
be generated by nuclear reactors and by spallation sources, which are
described later. Such large-scale facilities are, of course, an expensive
way to produce neutron radiation, so it is worthwhile only if there are
clear advantages over X-rays. In the case of scattering and diffraction
this is true in certain cases, and the two techniques are complementary.
X-rays are scattered by the electron density of atoms, so the scatter-
ing is proportional to atomic number. This means that ‘heavy atoms’
(those with many electrons) dominate X-ray diffraction by crystals, and
lighter atoms are relatively difﬁcult to see and imprecisely located. It
also means that neighbouring elements in the periodic table give almost
identical X-ray scattering and can not easily be distinguished on this
basis alone.
Neutrons, by contrast, are scattered by atomic nuclei. There is no
simple dependence on atomic number, and the variation of neutron
scattering across the whole periodic table is much smaller than that of
X-ray scattering. Neutron scattering by neighbouring elements can be
very different; the variation from element to element is quite erratic, and

340
X-ray and neutron sources
differentisotopesofagivenelementusuallyhavequitedifferentneutron
scattering powers, while they are completely indistinguishable to X-
rays. These differences are illustrated by some examples in Table 22.1.
Note that some nuclei have a negative neutron scattering factor (usually
expressed as a scattering length with units of fm); they scatter exactly
out of phase with other nuclei. In general, neutron scattering is much
weaker than X-ray diffraction (the two sets of values in Table 22.1 are not
on the same scale). The adjacent elements Co and Fe have very different
neutron scattering factors, while their X-ray scattering factors differ by
only a few per cent. Deuterium scatters neutrons almost as strongly as
does uranium, but is essentially invisible to X-rays when both elements
are in the same material, and it is dramatically different from its lighter
isotope H for neutron diffraction.

These features of neutron scattering by nuclei lead to a number of
practical advantages over X-ray diffraction in certain types of studies.
(a) It is often easier to locate light atoms precisely in the pres-
ence of heavier ones. For example, the exact positions of oxide
anions in complex metal-oxide structures can be very important in
understanding properties such as superconductivity and unusual
magnetism. If heavy metals are present, this is a serious challenge
for X-ray diffraction, especially if the oxide positions display any
disorder. Oxygen has a relatively large neutron scattering length;
it is very similar to that of barium (Table 22.1) – in fact a little
higher – but with X-rays Ba scatters seven times as strongly as O.
(b) The most extreme case of this is the location of H atoms, for which
X-ray diffraction is not the ideal technique in view of the low elec-
tron density of H. Neutron diffraction is very much more effective
here(evenmoresoifDreplacesH),incaseswhereitisimportantto
ﬁnd H atoms reliably, such as in metal-hydride complexes, agostic
interactions, and unusual hydrogen-bonding patterns. The prob-
lem for X-ray diffraction is made worse by the fact that the electron
density of the H atom is involved in bonding; it is not centred on
the nucleus, but is distorted towards the adjacent atom, leading to
a systematic apparent shortening of X–H bonds in X-ray diffrac-
tion studies. Neutron diffraction is not affected by the bonding or
by other valence-electron density features such as lone pairs, and
it determines accurate nuclear positions and hence internuclear
distances.
(c) Insomecasestheabilityofneutronstodistinguishclearlybetween
atoms of neighbouring elements in the periodic table is impor-
tant for a reliable structure determination, such as in mixed-metal
complexes or metal alloys.
(d) Isotopes of the same element appear quite different in neutron
diffraction, in most cases, whereas they are completely identical in
X-ray diffraction. This may be useful, for example, in establishing
the positions of isotopically labelled atoms in a product as part of
an investigation of the reaction mechanism.

22.4
Neutron sources
341
The weak interaction of neutrons with nuclei in a crystalline sample,
compared with the rather stronger interaction of X-rays with electrons,
means that larger crystals are usually required for neutron diffraction,
though this limitation of the technique is mitigated to some extent with
more intense modern neutron sources and more sensitive detectors. On
the other hand, it means that neutrons are generally more penetrating
than X-rays, giving lower absorption, allowing the study of materials
in containers through which X-rays would not pass, and leading to lit-
tle radiation damage (except in cases where neutrons react with some
nuclei to generate new nuclei). Nuclei are also effectively point scatter-
ers in contrast to the ﬁnite size of the electron distribution in an atom, so
neutron scattering from a stationary atom does not fall off with increas-
ing angle as does X-ray diffraction – the θ dependence is due only to
atomic displacements, which are reduced at low temperature.
One other special property of neutrons is that they have an instrin-
sic magnetic moment, or spin. This can be exploited to investigate
magnetic properties such as ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism and anti-
ferromagnetism, which involve regular arrangements of atomic mag-
netic moments (and these are due to unpaired electrons, so this is a
neutron-electron interaction) in a solid material.
Two main types of neutron sources are used for crystallography. A
nuclear reactor uses neutrons to maintain its activity, but more are pro-
duced by 235U ﬁssion than are needed for the continued nuclear chain
reaction, so the excess can be extracted in a continuous supply. The
Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble is an example, and serves as a
European international facility, adjacent to ESRF.
Aspallation source generates rapid pulses of neutrons (and other sub-
atomic particles) by accelerating protons in a synchrotron and directing
them at a target containing heavy-metal atoms such as tungsten. The
wavelength of each neutron can be determined by measuring its ‘time
of ﬂight’ between the source and detector, as an alternative to select-
ing a monochromatic beam. An example of a spallation source is ISIS
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, adjacent to
Diamond.
For both types of neutron source, diffraction equipment is similar to
that used with X-rays, but it tends to be larger and more heavily shielded
for radiation. The greater penetrating power of neutrons means that
samples can be held in larger and thicker containers, including closed
low-temperature and high-pressure devices.
Finally, we note that combining X-ray and neutron diffraction for the
same sample material can exploit the complementary advantages of the
two techniques, for example in obtaining reliable structural information
when a wide range of elements is present, simultaneously investigating
geometrical and magnetic structural features, or decoupling valence and
atomic displacement effects in accurate high-resolution charge-density
studies of bonding.
For more detailed accounts of neutron diffraction, see Wilson (2000);
Piccoli et al. (2007).

Introduction
To paraphrase Lord Kelvin, when you cannot express your observations
in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.
The use of scientiﬁc observation to add to our knowledge inevitably
means we need to express both observations and deductions mathe-
matically. The link between the two is mathematical also. We present
here some mathematics and a few formulae that are important in X-ray
crystallography.

Trigonometry
Trigonometry means ‘measurement of triangles’, but its use goes far
beyond what its name suggests. Many properties of triangles can be
summarized in terms of the ratios of the sides of the right-angled triangle
in Fig. A.1, giving:
cos θ = a/c
sin θ = b/c
tan θ = b/a
so that tan θ = sin θ/ cos θ.
The symmetry of the sine and cosine functions shows that cos(−θ) =
cos(θ) and sin(−θ) = −sin(θ).
Another relationship among these functions is obtained from
Pythagoras’ theorem:
a2 + b2 = c2
giving cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1.
343

344
Useful mathematics and formulae
Also useful in crystallography are the multiple angle formulae, which
are given without derivation as:
cos(θ + φ) = cos θ cos φ −sin θ sin φ
and sin(θ + φ) = sin θ cos φ + cos θ sin φ.
These come into their own in the manipulation of the electron-density
equation for numerical calculation. For example, by putting θ = 2π(hx+
ky) and φ = 2πlz in the above expressions, cos 2π(hx + ky + lz) can be
changed into:
cos 2π(hx + ky + lz) = cos 2π(hx + ky) cos 2πlz
−sin 2π(hx + ky) sin 2πlz.
A similar operation gives
cos 2π(hx + ky) = cos(2πhx) cos(2πky) −sin(2πhx) sin(2πky)
sin 2π(hx + ky) = sin(2πhx) cos(2πky) + cos(2πhx) sin(2πky),
so that
cos 2π(hx + ky + lz) = cos(2πhx) cos(2πky) cos(2πlz)
−sin(2πhx) sin(2πky) cos(2πlz)
−sin(2πhx) cos(2πky) sin(2πlz)
−cos(2πhx) sin(2πky) sin(2πlz).
It looks as if we have made things far more complicated by doing
this. However, these expressions usually simplify enormously in dif-
ferent ways according to space group symmetry and are useful in the
Beevers–Lipson factorization of the electron-density equation, which is
how many computer programs handle Fourier transform summations.

Complex numbers
Much of the mathematics dealing with structure factors and discrete
Fourier transforms makes use of complex numbers. It is a pity these
numbers have the name they do, because it has the connotation of being
complicated. Complex numbers are simply numbers with two compo-
nents instead of the usual one. The components are called the real and
imaginary parts of the number and can be plotted on a two-dimensional
diagram, called an Argand diagram, as shown in Fig. A.2. The number
plotted has real and imaginary parts of a and b, respectively, and can be
written algebraically as a + ib where i2 = −1. You may regard the imag-
inary constant i as a mathematical curiosity, but the important property
of its square given in the previous sentence enables complex numbers
to be multiplied and divided in a completely consistent way.

A.4
Waves and structure factors
345
An equivalent way to represent a complex number is in polar form, i.e.
intermsofr andθ inFig.A.2.Thesearecalledthemodulusandargument
of the number respectively. A knowledge of trigonometry allows us
to write
a + ib = r cos θ + i r sin θ = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = r eiθ.
The last relationship used in this equation is
cos θ + i sin θ = eiθ,
which is one of the most amazing relationships in the whole of mathe-
matics. Pythagoras’ theorem tells us that r2 = a2 + b2 and we also have
tan θ = b/a.
Some properties of complex numbers are important for the manip-
ulation of structure factors. A simple operation is to take the complex
conjugate, which means changing the sign of the imaginary part. Thus,
the complex conjugate of the complex number a+ib is written as (a+ib)∗
and it is equal to a −ib. You should be able to conﬁrm that multiplying
a complex number by its complex conjugate gives a real number that is
the square of the modulus:
(a + i b)(a + i b)∗= (a + i b)(a −i b)
= a2 −i a b + i a b −i2b2 = a2 + b2 = r2.
A.4
Waves and structure factors
X-rays are waves and we must be able to deal with them mathematically.
The obvious wavy functions are sines and cosines, so these are used in
the mathematical description of waves. It is an enormous convenience
to combine both sines and cosines into the single term exp(iθ) as seen
in the last equation but one above. This is the main reason why you
ﬁnd complex exponentials in the structure factor and electron-density
equations ((1.1) and (1.2), respectively, in Chapter 1).
Similarly, the structure factors F(hkl) are the mathematical represen-
tation of diffracted waves. When they are combined to form an image
of the electron density (which represents adding waves together), their
relative phases are important. The mathematical construction in Fig.A.2
allows both the amplitude of the wave, |F(hkl)|, and its relative phase,
φ(hkl), to be represented by the modulus and argument of a single com-
plex number. This leads us to write a structure factor in various ways
such as:
F(h) = A(h) + i B(h) = |F(h)| cos(φ(h)) + i|F(h)| sin(φ(h))
= |F(h)| exp(iφ(h)),

346
Useful mathematics and formulae
where the diffraction indices (hkl) are represented by the components of
the vector h.
The structure-factor equation, (1.1) in Chapter 1, shows that F(h) =
F∗(h), i.e. structure factors that are Friedel opposites are complex
conjugates of each other. This leads immediately to the relationship
F(h) × F(h) = |F(h)|2. In addition, we ﬁnd that the product of any
two structure factors can be written as:
F(h) × F(k) = |F(h)| eiφ(h) × |F(k)| eiφ(k) = |F(h)F(k)| ei(φ(h)+φ(k)),
showing that the structure factor magnitudes multiply and the phases
add. This is of importance when applying direct methods of phase
determination.

A.5
Vectors
A vector is often described as a quantity that has magnitude and direc-
tion, as opposed to a scalar quantity that has only magnitude. This
deﬁnition is sufﬁcient for the present purpose and we shall see how
useful the directional properties of vectors are. One of the consequences
of this is that vectors can be added together as shown in Fig. A.3. The
vectors x1 and x12 are added together to give the resultant x2. This is
expressed algebraically as:
x1 + x12 = x2.
Note that vectors are conventionally written in bold characters, as are
matrices when we come to them. If the vectors x1 and x2 give the posi-
tions of two atoms in the unit cell, they are known as position vectors;
x12 is known as a displacement vector, giving the displacement of atom
2 relative to atom 1. A rearrangement of the above equation expresses
the displacement vector as x12 = x2 −x1 and these displacement vectors
arise in the description of the Patterson function (see Chapter 9).
In the unit cell, the position vector x has components (x, y, z) such that
x = ax + by + cz,
where a, b and c are the lattice translation vectors (the edges of the unit
cell) and x, y and z are the fractional co-ordinates of the point. The vector
displacement of atom 2 from atom 1 can therefore be written as
x12 = x2 −x1 = (ax2 + by2 + cz2) −(ax1 + by1 + cz1)
= a(x2 −x1) + b(y2 −y1) + c(z2 −z1).
Similarly, the position of a point in reciprocal space is given by the vector
h, which has components (h,k,l) such that:
h = a*h + b*k + c*l,

A.6
Vectors
347
where a*, b* and c* are the reciprocal lattice translation vectors (the
edges of the reciprocal unit cell) and h, k and l are usually integers giving
the diffraction indices of the structure factor F(h) at that point in the
reciprocal lattice.
The scalar (dot) product of the two vectors x and h is:
h.x = hx + ky + lz,
which is an expression to be found in both the structure factor and
electron-density equations. The vector (cross) product is used in the
relationships between the direct and reciprocal lattices:
a∗= b × c
V
b∗= c × a
V
c∗= a × b
V
V = a.b × c,
where V is the volume of the unit cell. It should be remembered that
a × b = ab sin γ n,
where γ is the angle between the vectors and n is a unit vector perpen-
dicular to both a and b, such that a, b and n are a right-handed set. It
should be clear from these relationships that a* is perpendicular to the
bc-plane; similarly, b* and c* are perpendicular to the ac- and ab-planes,
respectively. If you need convincing that vectors are the most convenient
way of expressing these relationships, here is the volume of the unit cell
without using vectors:
V = abc

1 −cos2 α −cos2 β −cos2 γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ .
The angles of the reciprocal lattice can be obtained from the relationships
above but, to save you the trouble, they are:
cos α∗= cos β cos γ −cos α
sin β sin γ
,
with corresponding expressions for cos β* and cos γ * obtained by cyclic
permutation of α, β, and γ .
The calculation of a Bragg angle is commonly required, for example
to calculate structure factors or the setting angles on a diffractometer. In
the triclinic system, the formula is:
4 sin2 θ
λ2
= h2a∗2 + k2b∗2 + l2c∗2 + 2hka∗b∗cos γ ∗
+ 2klb∗c∗cos α∗+ 2lhc∗a∗cos β∗,
and this simpliﬁes enormously for other crystal systems.

Determinants
Determinants feature in inequality relationships among structure
factors, are needed in matrix inversion, and form a useful diagnostic
tool when your least-squares reﬁnement runs into trouble. A determi-
nant is a square array of numbers that has a single algebraic value. An
order two determinant is written and evaluated as:

a
b
c

 = ad −bc,
and an order three determinant is:


= aei + bfg + cdh −ceg −bdi −afh.
In general, a determinant can be expressed in terms of determinants
of order one less than the original. For an order n determinant, this is
expressed as
 =
n

i=1
(−1)i+jaijij,
where aij is the ij element of  and ij is the determinant formed from
 by missing out the ith row and the jth column. The summation can
equally well be carried out over j instead of i and gives the same answer.
However, this is useful only for determinants of small order. Evalua-
tion of high-order determinants is best done using the process of Gauss
elimination (a standard mathematical procedure not discussed here) to
reduce the determinant to triangular form, then taking the product of
the diagonal elements.
A.7
Matrices
Matrices are used for a number of tasks in X-ray crystallography.
Typically, they represent symmetry operations, describe the orientation
of a crystal on a diffractometer, and are heavily used in the least-squares
reﬁnement of crystal structures. A brief refresher course will therefore
not be out of place. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or alge-
braic expressions and matrix algebra gives a very powerful way of
manipulating them.
One of the operations often required is to transpose a matrix. This
exchanges columns with rows so that, if A is the matrix

.
If a square matrix is symmetric, it is equal to its own transpose.
Matrix multiplication is carried out by multiplying the elements in a
row of the ﬁrst matrix by the elements in a column of the second and
adding the products. This forms the element in the product matrix on
the same row and column as those used in its calculation:

ﬁrst matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second. For example,
you may wish to verify that

and this form of expression is used to represent symmetry operations
in a computer.
It is sometimes useful to be able to deal with symmetry operations
in reciprocal space also. The operation above can be written in terms of
matrix algebra as
x′ = Cx + d,
where C is the 3×3 matrix and d the translation vector. If a space group
symmetry operation is carried out on the whole crystal, by deﬁnition

the X-rays see exactly the same structure. The structure-factor equation
may then be written as

fj exp(2πih.(Cxj + d) =
N

j=1
fj exp(2πihTCxj) × exp(2πih.d)
= F(hTC) exp(2πih.d).
That is, the two reﬂections F(h) and F(hTC) are symmetry related. Their
magnitudes are the same and there is a phase difference between them
of 2πh.d.
This is easier to understand if we continue with the example above.
The 21 axis is one of those that occur in the space group P212121. The
symmetry-related reﬂections that it produces are given by

That is, F(hkl) is related by symmetry to F(hkl). Their magnitudes must
be the same and there is a phase shift between them of
2πh.d = 2π(h k l).(1/2 1/2 0) = π(h + k).
Putting this all together gives the relationships |F(hkl)| = |F(hkl)| and
φ(hkl) = φ(hkl) + π(h + k). Thus, the phase is the same if h + k is even,
but shifted by π if h + k is odd.
Even with anomalous scattering, these relationships are strictly true.
It is only when structure factors are related by a complex conjugate that
they are affected differently by anomalous scattering. For example, in
P212121, we have already seen that |F(hkl)| and |F(hkl)| are always the
same, but |F(hkl)| and |F(hkl)| will be affected differently, as will |F(hkl)|
and |F(hkl)|.

Matrix inversion
The inverse of the square matrix A is the matrix A−1 that has the
property that
AA−1 = A−1A = I,
where I is the identity matrix (1s down the diagonal and 0s every-
where else).
Operations performed by multiplying by a matrix, A, can be undone
by multiplying by the inverse of the matrix, A−1. For an order 2 square

This recipe will work for any order of matrix, but it is extremely inef-
ﬁcient for orders higher than three. Larger matrices are best inverted
using Gauss elimination, as mentioned earlier. It is a commonly believed
fallacy that matrix inversion is necessary for solving systems of linear
simultaneous equations. Since it is quicker to solve equations than to
calculate an inverse matrix, the inverse should be calculated only if it is
speciﬁcally required, for example, to estimate standard uncertainties of
parameters determined by the equations.
A.10
Convolution
Convolution is an operation that affects the lives of all scientists. Since no
measuring or recording instrument is perfect, it will affect the quantity
that is detected before the recording takes place. For example, loud-
speakers change the signal that is fed to them from an ampliﬁer, thus
altering (hopefully slightly) the sound that you hear. The mathematical
description of this is called convolution. It also appears in the mathemat-
ics of crystallography, although many people function quite adequately
as crystallographers without knowing much about it.
The simplest example of convolution is in the description of a crystal.
The convolution of a lattice point with anything at all, e.g. a single unit
cell, leaves that object unchanged. However, the convolution of two
lattice points with a unit cell gives two unit cells, one at the position
of each lattice point. A complete crystal, therefore, can be described as
the convolution of a single unit cell with the whole crystal lattice. This
would seem to be an unnecessary complication except for the intimate
association of convolution with Fourier transforms.
The convolution theorem in mathematics states that: “the Fourier
transform of a product of two functions is given by the convolution
of their respective Fourier transforms.” That is, if c(x), f(x) and g(x) are
Fourier transforms of C(S), F(S) and G(S), respectively, the theorem may

352
Useful mathematics and formulae
be expressed mathematically as:
if
C(S) = F(S).G(S)
then
c(x) = f(x)∗g(x),
where ∗is the convolution operator.
This leads to the description of the X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal
as the product of the X-ray scattering from a single unit cell and the
reciprocal lattice, seen in the following relationships:

This allows us to deal with a single unit cell instead of the millions of
cells that make up the complete crystal.

Chapter 2
1. You are provided in Fig. 2.3 and Fig. 2.4 with four
two-dimensional repeating patterns (Traidcraft gift
wrapping paper!). For each one, identify lattice points
and outline a unit cell (possible shapes are oblique,
rectangular, square, and hexagonal; a rectangular unit
cell can be primitive or centred). Find the symmetry
elements; for a 2D pattern the following are possible:
2-, 3-, 4- and 6-fold rotations, mirror lines, and glide
lines (mirrors with a half-unit-cell translation compo-
nent parallel to the reﬂection line); in 2D inversion
symmetry is the same as a 2-fold rotation. Show what
fraction of the unit cell is the asymmetric unit.
See the diagrams provided on the next page; note that a
lot of 2D patterns such as wallpapers have higher met-
ric symmetry than true symmetry, because a rectangular
shape is convenient for printing, but the contents often
have lower symmetry than this. Here are some useful
notes for discussion.
In 1, there are normal reﬂections in one direction and
glides in the other. There are also two-fold rotations. The
unit cell is primitive rectangular (the conventional ori-
gin being chosen on a two-fold rotation point), and the
asymmetric unit is one quarter of this.
In 2, all the individual rectangular blocks are identical;
note here that the directions ‘up’ and ‘down’ are differ-
ent, so this is a polar group; there are vertical mirrors
(and glides), but no horizontal ones. The asymmetric
unit is one quarter of the centred rectangular unit cell.
For 3, no reﬂection is possible, because the spiral
shapes are chiral and are all of the same hand; all the
small rectangular blocks are identical. Although a rect-
angular unit cell can be selected, it is centred and there is
no good reason for this. The diamond shape is the most
convenient unit cell, and this is also the asymmetric unit.
For 4, the basic repeat pattern is a pair of rounded
triangles, but the mirror symmetry demands a rectan-
gular cell, so this is centred; it is conventional to put
the cell origin on one of the 2-fold axes (on an inver-
sion centre in 3D); as well as mirrors there are also
glide lines (a general feature of centred unit cells with
reﬂection symmetry). The asymmetric unit is half of a
rounded triangle, one eighth of the rectangular centred
unit cell.
2. The point group of a ferrocene molecule [Fe(C5H5)2]
is D5h, assuming an eclipsed conformation of the two
rings. This point group symmetry is not possible in
the crystalline solid state (no 5-fold rotation axes!). The
symmetry elements of D5h are: a ﬁve-fold rotation axis,
5 two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to this, 5 ‘ver-
tical’ mirror planes each containing Fe and 2 C atoms,
and one ‘horizontal’ mirror plane through Fe and lying
between the two rings (there is also an S5 improper
rotation axis). Which of these symmetry elements
could be retained in the site symmetry of a ferrocene
molecule in a crystal structure, and what is the high-
est possible point group symmetry for ferrocene in the
crystal (the maximum number of symmetry elements
that can be retained simultaneously)?
Each of the symmetry elements other than the ﬁve-fold
proper and improper rotations is possible in the solid
state, but not all at once (since this would retain the
ﬁve-fold symmetry also). Only one two-fold rotation

axis can be retained, because the others are all at ‘crys-
tallographically impossible’ angles to this one. Together
with this axis, we can retain two mirror planes: the one
relating the two rings to each other, and one other per-
pendicular to this, the two planes intersecting in the line
of the two-fold rotation axis. This point group symmetry
is C2v (mm2).
3. Why does the list of conventional Bravais lattices not
include any centred unit cells in the triclinic system,
tetragonal C, or cubic C?
Triclinic centred cells are unnecessary, as it is always
possible then to choose a smaller unit cell with the
centring points taken as corners, because there are no
requirements for special values of the cell axes or angles;

try it in 2D for an arbitrary centred oblique cell. For
tetragonal C, the square base can be halved in area
(choose two lattice points separated by one unit cell a
or b edge and two centring points to make a smaller
square), and this retains the conventional square-prism
shape for tetragonal symmetry; in the same way tetrag-
onal I and F can be converted into each other. Cubic
C is impossible, because this would make one pair of
opposite cell faces different from the other two pairs,
i.e. it makes the c-axis different from a and b; the same
would apply to tetragonal A or B centring.
4. Work out the point group and the Laue class corre-
sponding to the following space groups: (a) C2; (b)
Pna21; (c) Fd3c; (d) I41cd.
(a) C2 is point group 2, Laue group 2/m; (b) Pna21 is
point group mm2, Laue group mmm; (c) Fd3c is point
group m3m and this is also the Laue group, since it is
centrosymmetric; (d) I41cd is point group 4mm and Laue
group 4/mmm.
5. From the space group symbols alone, what (if any)
special positions would you expect to ﬁnd for (a) P1;
(b) C2; (c) P212121?
(a) The only symmetry here is inversion, and inversion
centres are the special positions (there are actually 8 per
unit cell; by conventional cell origin choice, they lie at
the corners, the middle of all edges, the middle of all
faces, and the body centre – it is a useful exercise to
demonstrate that this does give 8 per unit cell, since
most of them are shared by two or more cells!). (b) The
only symmetry elements are 2-fold rotation axes, and
any position on one of these is a special position. (c) The
only symmetry elements here are screw axes, and these
do not provide any special positions, since any atom on
a screw axis is shifted to another position by operation
of the screw; this space group has no special positions.

a) methane (M = 16.04), Z = 4, 54 Å3 per non-H atom;
b) diamond (M = 12.01), Z = 8, 5.7 Å3 per non-H atom;
c) glucose (M = 180.1), Z = 4, 15.9 Å3 per non-H atom;
d) Pt complex (M = 425.3), Z = 4, 16.9 Å3 per non-H

2. A unit cell has three different axis lengths and three
angles all apparently equal to 90◦. What is the met-
ric symmetry? The Laue symmetry, however, does not
agree with this; equivalent intensities are found to be
hkl ≡hkl ≡hkl ≡hkl
hkl ≡hkl ≡hkl ≡hkl.
What is the true crystal system and its conventional
axis setting?
The metric symmetry is orthorhombic. However, true
orthorhombic symmetry would make all 8 reﬂections
equivalent, not two sets of 4. The Laue symmetry is
monoclinic, but the unique axis here is c instead of the
conventional b setting, as shown by the fact that the
index l is the one that can change its sign alone and
still give an equivalent reﬂection; the other two have to
change sign together.
3. What are the systematic absences for the space groups
I222 and I212121?
BecauseoftheI centring,h+k+lmustbeevenforareﬂec-
tion intensity to be observed, for both space groups. This
affects all subsets of the reﬂections with one or with two
indices equal to zero. The systematically absent reﬂec-
tions with one index equal to zero do not, then, prove
that glide planes are present (they are not for these space
groups, but they are for Ibca, which has the same sys-
tematic absences but should have a different statistical
distribution of intensities because it is centrosymmet-
ric), and similarly the presence of screw axes can not
be deduced. In fact, both space groups have screw axes
and normal rotation axes parallel to all three cell axes,
but they are arranged in different relative positions; 2-
fold rotation axes in all three directions intersect each
other in I222, but not in I212121 in the way these two
space group symbols are conventionally assigned.

4. Deduce as much as you can about the space groups
of the compounds for which the following data were
obtained.
Systematic absences for general reﬂections give the unit
cell centring; other absences give glide planes and screw
axes; centric or acentric statistics indicate the presence
or absence of inversion centres.
a) Monoclinic. Conditions for observed reﬂections:
hkl, none; h0l, h+l even; h00, h even; 0k0, k even; 00l,
l even. Centric distribution for general reﬂections.
Monoclinic, P; h0l absences show n glide plane per-
pendicular to b and include h00 and 00l; 0k0 shows 21
parallel to b. This uniquely identiﬁes P21/n (alterna-
tive setting of P21/c with different choice of a,c axes),
which is centrosymmetric in accord with statistics.
b) Orthorhombic.Conditionsforobservedreﬂections:
hkl, all odd or all even; 0kl, k + l = 4n and both k
and l even; h0l, h + l = 4n and both h and l even;
hk0, h + k = 4n and both h and k even; h00, h = 4n,
0k0, k = 4n; 00l, l = 4n. Centric distribution for
general reﬂections.
Orthorhombic F (this condition can be expressed in
equivalent terms as: h + k, k + l, h + l all even, and
it includes all the all-even index observations for
reﬂections with one index zero); the various 4n obser-
vations for relections with one index equal to zero
show d glide planes perpendicular to all three cell
axes, and these include all the axial reﬂection condi-
tions (so no deduction of four-fold screw axes!). This
uniquely identiﬁes Fddd, which is centrosymmetric.
c) Orthorhombic.Conditionsforobservedreﬂections:
hkl, none; 0kl, k + l even; h0l, h even; hk0, none; h00,
h even; 0k0, k even; 00l, l even. Acentric distribution
for general reﬂections, centric for hk0.
Orthorhombic P; 0kl absences show n glide perpen-
diculartoa-axis;h0labsencesshowaglideperpendic-
ular to b-axis; no glide plane perpendicular to c-axis
and absences say nothing about mirror planes; all
axial absences are contained within the glide plane
conditions, so prove nothing. Acentric distribution
indicates no inversion symmetry, so there can not be
a mirror plane perpendicular to c (this would give the
centrosymmetric point group mmm and space group
Pnam, an alternative setting of the conventional Pnma
with a change of axes). Point group must be mm2,
with either 2 or 21 parallel to c-axis. In fact it is 21
and the space group is Pna21 (there is no Pna2, this is
an impossible combination of symmetry elements).
d) Tetragonal. Reﬂections hkl and khl have the same
intensity. Conditions for observed reﬂections: hkl,
none; 0kl, none; h0l, none; hk0, none; h00, h even;
0k0, k even; 00l, l = 4n; hh0, none. Acentric distribu-
tion for general reﬂections; centric for 0kl, h0l, hk0,
and hhl subsets of data.
Tetragonal P; the equivalence of hkl and khl shows
mirror symmetry in the ab diagonal for the Laue
group, which is 4/mmm rather than 4/m; there are no
glide planes, from reﬂections with one zero index; 00l
absences show either 41 or 43 along c-axis; h00 and
0k0 show 21 parallel to both a and b (which are equiv-
alent in tetragonal symmetry); no absences for hh0,
so no 21 in the ab diagonal direction. Space group
is either P41212 or P43212; these are an enantiomor-
phous pair, and are non-centrosymmetric.

The unit cell parameters are a = 8, b = 4, c = 10 Å.
The crystal is mounted exactly along c. This would be
ﬁne on a diffractometer with a ﬁxed non-zero χ circle
but not on a four-circle (favours multiple diffraction
effects) or a single-axis diffractometer (minimizes
coverage).

Mo radiation would you use to determine the
following problems, and why? (a) C6H4Br2; (b)

ration of C24H42N2O8; (e) absolute conﬁguration of
C24H40Br2N2O8.
(a) Although absorption is lower with Mo radiation the
difference is rather small (about 20%). If the crystal is
weakly diffracting you should use Cu radiation.
(b) Absorption is more than twice as serious with Cu,
due to the high chlorine content. Mo is clearly better.
(c) Ru is beyond the Mo absorption edge and absorption
has dropped off, so Mo is strongly preferred.
(d) Must use Cu as N and O have almost no anomalous
scattering with Mo.

If this pattern is repeated throughout the full set of
measurements, the answer is no. The reﬂections divide
into two sets of monoclinic equivalents with intensities
grouped around 260 and 200.
3. A compound C32H31N3O2 crystallized from tetrahy-
drofuran (thf) (C4H8O) solution gives a primitive
monoclinic unit cell of 1850 Å3. What are the likely
unit cell contents?
There is no mathematically unique answer to this ques-
tion. The compound and thf have 37 and ﬁve non-H
atoms requiring 666 Å3 and 90 Å3, respectively. The
unit cell could contain three molecules of the compound
(1998 Å3) and no thf but the agreement is not good and
Z = 3 is unlikely. If it held two molecules of the com-
pound (1332 Å3) that would leave 518 Å3, enough for
about six molecules of thf per unit cell. Such a crystal
would most likely lose solvent unless protected.
4. Estimate the range of absorption correction factors for

mm, mounted parallel to the ﬁbre; d) a needle 0.06 ×
0.08 × 0.40 mm, mounted across the ﬁbre. Repeat the
calculations with μ = 0.1 and 5.0 mm−1.
Method: consider the likely paths the beams will follow
and calculate exp(−μx) for each case. [The maximum
and minimum paths will be (a) 0.02 and 0.4 mm; (b) 0.2
and 0.4 mm; (c) 0.06 and 0.08 mm; (d) 0.06 or 0.08 and

90.24(8), 90.08(6)◦; (b) 8.327(4), 10.622(6), 16.804(8) Å, 90,
90, 90◦. The ﬁrst estimate was derived from the origi-
nal orientation matrix reﬁnement using 67 reﬂections,
while the second was obtained by a ﬁnal constrained
reﬁnement using 5965 reﬂections from the entire
frameset. Estimate the approximate contribution in
each case to the uncertainty in a C–C bond of 1.520 Å.
This calculation involves some approximations and
assumptions, the point being to get a reasonable esti-
mate of the uncertainties involved and decide whether
these are important. Consider case (b) ﬁrst: you need
to calculate the relative uncertainties in the three cell
dimensions and realize that these are roughly the same
[the error is about 1 part in 2000]. Next, proceed on the
basis that cell standard uncertainties are isotropic. You
can then use the ﬁgure of 1 in 2000 to get a contribution
to the uncertainty in the C–C bond of 1.520 Å /2000 =
0.0008 Å, which will not be signiﬁcant in any but the
most accurate determinations. The calculation is valid
for all orientations of the C–C bond.
The cell in (a) is obviously poorer. Work out the rela-
tive uncertainties in a, b and c [1 in 700, 1 in 650 and 1 in
350, respectively]. The errors are much higher and not
isotropic. Next, work out the contribution to the uncer-
tainty for a C–C bond lying parallel to each of the (100),
(010) and (001) directions. [Answers are 0.002, 0.002 and
0.004 Å, respectively.] These, especially the last, would
add signiﬁcantly to the uncertainty of a typical struc-
ture determination. Note that the values are probably
an underestimate as we have ignored any contribution
from the unconstrained angles.

1. Measuring a reﬂection for twice the time doubles the
observed intensity I. What is the effect on σ(I) and
on I/σ(I)?
σ(I) is increased by √2; I/σ(I) is increased by √2 (2/√2).
2. An area detector with diameter a of 6.0 cm normally
sits at a distance D of 5.0 mm from the crystal. Calcu-
late the 2θ ranges that would be recorded with θc set at
28.0◦if D was increased to (a) 6.0 cm; (b) 7.0 cm; (c) 8.0
cm. Assuming Mo Kα radiation, at what point should
you consider using two settings for θc?
Using the expression tan−1(a/2D) for the range on either
side of θc, the upper and lower 2θ limits are (a) 1.4–54.6;
(b) 4.8–51.2; (c) 7.5–48.5◦. Given that an upper 2θ limit
of around 50◦is acceptable to all journals, you might
decide to use two detector settings when the distance D
is more than 7 cm.

3. A frameset was processed satisfactorily as orthorhom-
bic, except for consistently high values of around 0.25
forthemergingRindex.Althoughtheresultingdataset
led to a plausible-looking solution, the subsequent
reﬁnement stalled at R = 0.19. There are no signiﬁcant
absorption effects. Suggest a possible solution.
The crystal system would most likely have been
assigned as orthorhombic on metric considerations, but
these may have been misleading. Orthorhombic and
monoclinic are differentiated by whether the third cell
angle is also exactly 90◦: a monoclinic β angle close
to this value may lead to an incorrect assignment of
the crystal system as orthorhombic. The slightly poor
agreement between the intensities under orthorhombic
symmetry is not deﬁnitive, but the frameset should be
re-processed under monoclinic symmetry and the cor-
responding structure solution and reﬁnement investi-
gated. The plausibility of the solution under orthorhom-
bic symmetry may be a sign that some form of pseudo-
symmetry is present.

1. In Fig. 8.3, assign the correct atom types, the H atoms,
and the appropriate bond types (single, double, or
aromatic). The correct formula is C13H12N2O. Why
is there only one peak visible for the ethyl group H
atoms?

Correct assignment of atom and bond types.
One C should be N, and one N should be O, because of
extra electron density needed. H atoms on rings all show
clearly. From number of H atoms and chemical sense, the
chain must be ethyl. All bond types follow from valency
considerations. Only one H atom of the ethyl group lies
in this plane; the other four are above and below it, so
are not seen in this 2D section of the full 3D map.
2. What would be the effect on a Fourier synthesis of:
a) omitting the term F(000);
All values of the electron density are reduced by this
value. This will make the electron density negative
in many regions, but relative values are still correct.
b) omitting the 20% of reﬂections with highest values
of (sin θ)/λ;
This would increase the usual series termination
error, introducing greater ripples into the electron
density; there will be additional spurious peaks as
a result.
c) omitting the 5% of reﬂections with lowest values of
(sin θ)/λ;
These reﬂections contribute broad low-resolution
features to the electron density, so there will be a dis-
tortion of the general level of electron density around
the unit cell; individual peaks will probably still be
recognizable, but with the wrong relative heights. A
few very low-angle reﬂections are sometimes miss-
ing, especially for large unit cells, because they lie
partly or fully behind the X-ray beam stop. This is
not usually a problem.
d) setting all phases equal to zero?
This is effectively the same as a Patterson function,
but using amplitudes instead of their squares. The
appearance will be very similar, but there will be less
variation in the peak heights.

peaks in the Patterson map include some with vector
lengths 2.8–3.3 Å. To what features in the molecular
structure do these peaks correspond? Deduce whether
the molecule is likely to be monomeric or dimeric, and
give the expected co-ordination number of bismuth.

Vectors between general positions in P21/n for Exercises 1 and 2.
One Bi is at 0.020, 0.175, 0.457 (half the numbers for the
fourth peak, which is 2x, 2y, 2z, and consistent with the
second and third peaks if allowed shifts and inversions
are applied). There are actually a lot of possible cor-
rect answers, by choosing different unit cell origins and
inverting either y or both x and z together. Co-ordinates
of the other 3 Bi atoms are obtained by applying the
general position transformations to the ﬁrst atom. The
next highest peaks will be due to vectors between Bi and
Br atoms; some of these are intermolecular, and others
are intramolecular and will have vector lengths equal to
Bi–Br bond lengths, around 3 Å. The shortest Bi…Bi dis-
tance is 4.46 Å and is appropriate for the diagonal of a
Bi2Br2 four-membered ring with two bromides bridging
two Bi atoms. This would give each Bi atom 2 terminal
phosphine and 2 terminal bromide ligands, and a share
in 2 bridging bromides, so the co-ordination number is
6 instead of the 5 indicated by the monomer formula.
The structure is dimeric with the ring on an inversion
centre.

Again, there are many possible correct answers. Co-
ordinates are obtained singly from peaks 2, 3 and 4; in
pairs from peaks 5, 6 and 7; and all together from peak
8. Note how all the co-ordinates of peaks in any col-
umn are zero, half, or one of two values adding up to
1/2. This shows that they are all due to pairs of the same
set of 8 symmetry-equivalent heavy atoms. One possi-
ble answer is obtained by just halving the co-ordinates of
peak 8: 0.129, 0.164, 0.206 (keeping to 3 decimal places).
It really is as easy as this!

Peaks 2 and 3 are the sums and differences of the co-
ordinates of the two heavy atoms in the asymmetric
unit. Peaks 4 and 5 are vectors between pairs of atoms
related by the inversion symmetry (2x, 2y, 2z). There
are several ways of solving this. One is to ﬁnd one of
the heavy atoms from either peak 3 or peak 4 as for the
single-heavy-atom situation, and then use the sum and
difference peaks to locate the second atom, checking the
answer against the remaining peak. Another is to solve
peaks 2 and 3 as a pair of simultaneous equations and

check the answers against peaks 4 and 5. Yet another
method is to ﬁnd one atom from peak 4 and provi-
sional co-ordinates for the other from peak 5, then use
peaks 2 and 3 to decide how to resolve the sign and
±1/2 ambiguities for this second atom to give consistent
answers. One of many correct answers (co-ordinates to 2
decimal places) is: Fe1 at 0.32, 0.36, 0.18; Fe2 at 0.18, 0.35,
0.67. The ﬁrst of these is just half the co-ordinates of peak
4, the other is half the co-ordinates of peak 5, except that
1/2 must be added to the z co-ordinate to obtain a result
consistent with peaks 2 and 3.

1. Set up the order 3 Karle–Hauptman determinant for
a centrosymmetric structure whose top row contains
the reﬂections with indices 0, h, and 2h. Hence, obtain
a constraint on the sign of E(2h). What is the sign of
E(2h) if E(0) = 3, |E(h)| = |E(2h)| = 2?
The required determinant is:

E (0)
E (h)
E (2h)
E (−h)
E (0)
E (h)
E (−2h)
E (−h)
E (0)

,
which can be expanded to give the inequality relation-
ship:
E (0)
'
E2 (0) −|E (2h)|2 −2 |E (h)|2(
+ 2 |E (h)|2 E (2h) ≥0.
This can be simpliﬁed by cancelling out a common factor
of [E(0) −E(2h)] and rearranging to give:
|E (h)|2 ≤1
2E (0)

E (0) + E (2h)

.
With the given amplitudes, the left-hand side of the
inequality is 4 and the right-hand side is 15/2 or 3/2 for
E(2h) positive or negative, respectively. The sign of E(2h)
must, therefore, be positive.
2. Verify (10.8). What sign information does it contain
under the conditions E(0) = 3, |E(h)| = |E(2h)| =
2, |E(h −k)| = 1?
Equation (10.8) comes directly from the expansion of the
determinant in (10.7). With the given amplitudes, the
inequality becomes 8 ≥0 or −8 ≥0 depending on the
sign of E(−h)E(h−k)E(k). The sign of E(−h)E(h−k)E(k)
must, therefore, be positive.
3. Expand the order 4 Karle–Hauptman determinant for a
centrosymmetric structure whose top row contains the
reﬂections with indices 0, h, h+k, and h+k+l and for
which E(h + k) = E(k + l) = 0. Interpret your expres-
sion in terms of the sign information to be obtained
and under which conditions it occurs.
The order four determinant is:

E (0)
E (h)
E (h + k)
E (h + k + l)
E (−h)
E (0)
E (k)
E (k + l)
E (−h −k)
E (−k)
E (0)
E (l)
E (−h −k −l)
E (−k −l)
E (−l)
E (0)

.
With E(h + k) = E(k + l) = 0, this forms the inequality
relationship:
E2(0)[E2(0) −|E(h)|2 −|E(k)|2 −|E(l)|2
−|E(−h −k −l)|2] + |E(h)E(l)|2 + |E(k)E(−h −k −l)|2
−2E(h)E(k)E(l)E(−h −k −l) ≥0,
and with suitably large amplitudes, this can be used to
prove that the sign of E(h)E(k)E(l)E(−h −k −l) must be
negative; this is a negative quartet relationship.
4. Compare the Karle–Hauptman determinants with the
following reﬂections in the top row: 0, h, h+k, h+k+l;
0, k, k+l, k+l+h; 0, l, l+h, l+h+k. Summarize the sign
information they contain when E(h), E(k), E(l), E(h +
k+l) areall strong and E(h+k) = E(k+l) = E(l+h) = 0.
The three determinants are obtained from the one in
Exercise 3 by cyclic permutation of indices. Together
they give a stronger indication of the negative quartet
provided that E(h + k) = E(k + l) = E(h + l) = 0.
5. Symbolic addition applied to a projection. Ammo-
nium oxalate monohydrate gives orthorhombic crys-
tals, P21212, with a = 8.017, b = 10.309, c = 3.735 Å (at
30 K). The short c–axis projection makes this an ideal
structure for study in projection, as there can be little
overlap of atoms. Data for the projection have been
sharpened to point atoms at rest (i.e. converted to E-
values) and are shown in Fig. 10.5 (below). Note the
mmsymmetryandthefactthatdataareonlypresentfor
h00 and 0k0 for even orders, consistent with the screw
axes. Find the especially strong data 5,7; −14, 5; 9, −12,
which have indices summing to zero, as an example of
a triple phase relationship (we omit the l index, since
it is always zero for these reﬂections).
The problem is that phases must be assigned to the
structure factors before they can be added up. Since
this projection is centrosymmetric, phases must be 0
or π radians (0 or 180◦), i.e. E must be given a sign + or
−, but there are 228 combinations of these values, and

your chance of getting an interpretable map is small!
Fortunately, the planes giving strong |E| values are
related by enough relationships to give us a unique, or
almost unique, solution. The main relationship used
is that for large values of |E|, say |E1|, |E2| and |E3| all
> 1.5, if: h1+h2+h3 = k1+k2+k3 (= l1+l2+l3) = 0,
then: φ1+φ2+φ3 ≈0. Additional help is given by the

planes <23>
planes <33>
The plane group (two-dimensional space group) is
pgg, with glide lines perpendicular to both axes, and
there are four alternative positions for the origin: 0, 0;
0, 1/2; 1/2, 0; and 1/2, 1/2. This means that two phases may
be arbitrarily ﬁxed from any two of the parity groups
g, u; u, g; or u, u (g and u mean even and odd, respec-
tively, for the indices h and k), since, for example,
shifting the origin by half a unit cell along a will
shift the phase of all structure factors with h odd by
π. Another result of the symmetry is that planes with
indices h, k are related to h, −k or −h, k by the glide
lines. The structure amplitudes must be the same for
these, and the phases must be related, although they
are not always the same. If h and k are both even or
both odd, φ(h, k) = φ(−h, k). If, however, one is odd
and one even, φ(h, k) = π + φ(−h, k). See the exam-
ples given for (2,3) and (3,3) in the diagrams. In other
words, if we have a sign for a particular reﬂection h, k
and we want the sign for either −h, k or h, −k, then we
must change the sign if h + k is odd, but not if h + k is
even. Such sign changes are marked * in the list below.
To get started, assign arbitrary signs to 5,7 and 14,5, and
give 8,8 the symbol A (unknown, to be determined).
Data marked * have opposite signs to those that have
both indices positive. Triples are arranged from left to
right and downwards in order of decreasing reliabil-
ity. Note A2 = 1 whatever the sign of A. For brevity,
use B to stand for −A.
To get started, arbitrary signs (+) have been assigned
to5,7and14,5andthesymbolAto8,8.Bmeanstheoppo-
site to sign A. Alternative solutions may be obtained
with other combinations of signs. The fact that A = + is
shown by the alternative values found for 8,13, here B
and –.

The expected error in α is half that of the others so the

restraint changes the equation α + β + γ = 180 into
2α + 2β + 2γ = 360 (the factor of 2 is arbitrary).

Chapter 13
In these model answers, Yo and Yc are used to represent
either Fo and Fc, or their squared values (F2o, F2c).
General
1. List some of the important differences between
P21/m, P21 and Pm.
All three space groups are monoclinic. P21/m is cen-
trosymmetric.Removalofthecentrecreateseitheroftwo
non-centrosymmetric space groups. Pm is achiral (con-
tains both hands if the molecule is chiral), and has two
ﬂoating origin axes. P21 is chiral and has one ﬂoating
origin axis.
2. Give some reasons for wishing to publish structures
in P21/a or P21/n; Pnma, Pnam or Pna21.
Both P21/a and P21/n refer to the same arrangement
of symmetry operators. Only the orientation of the cell
axes differs. The most stable reﬁnement is achieved by
choosing the setting with a monoclinic angle closest to
90◦. Pnam and Pnma are the same centrosymmetric space
group but with the axes differently labelled. Pnma is the
‘standard setting’, but Pnam preserves the axis notation
of the corresponding non-centrosymmetric space group,
Pna21.
3. A structure could be published in P1, or in A1 with a
celloftwicethevolume.Couldthisbevalid,howmany
parameters would be involved in each reﬁnement, and
how might the observation to parameter ratio alter?
A1 is a centred non-standard setting of P1. Though
the cell is bigger, the number of reﬂections is the same
(becauseofthesystematicabsences),andtheextraatoms
in the cell are generated from the asymmetric unit by
the additional symmetry operator. The observation-to-
parameter ratio is unaltered. Non-standard settings may
be chosen either to achieve a cell with angles close to
90◦, or to preserve a relationship with another material
or phase.
4. A synthetic organic material yields a good triclinic
dataset. The structure will not solve in P1, but solves
easily in P1. What should one do next?
This situation is not uncommon if the cell contains two
molecules – the absence of restrictions on the phase
angles in the non-centrosymmetric space group permits
effective tangent reﬁnement. The resulting structure
should be examined for a centre of symmetry, since
the synthesis would normally be expected to produce a
racemic mixture. If an approximate centre is found, the
structure should be shifted so that the pseudo-centre lies
on a true centre in P1.
5. Imagine an organometallic compound with poten-
tially 3-fold molecular rotation symmetry. Would you
be worried if the diffractometer proposed the space
group C2/c?

Questions and answers
365
C2/c is a subgroup of R3c, so one should be alert to the
possibilitythatthetruesymmetryisrhombohedral,with
the molecule actually lying on a 3-fold rotation axis.
6. An organolead compound crystallizes in Pc, and
solves in that space group. Comment on origin-ﬁxing
techniques, and their effect on atomic and molecular
parameter s.u.s.
Pc is non-centrosymmetric with two ﬂoating directions
(both in the unique plane). Singularity of the normal
equations can be avoided by shift-limiting (Marquardt)
restraints, by restraining the centre of gravity, or by
eigenvalue ﬁltering (all of which produce evenly dis-
tributed s.u.s). Older programs may ﬁx the x and z
co-ordinates of one atom. The s.u.s that should be asso-
ciated with these co-ordinates appear as increased s.u.s
inalltheotheratoms.Itisobviouslybettertoﬁxaheavy
atom than a light one. Molecular parameter s.u.s will be
correct under all regimes if the full variance–covariance
matrix is used, but over-estimated by the atom-ﬁxing
method if only the variances are used.
7. Explain what happens during reﬁnement given the
following scenarios: a) a few structurally important C
atoms have been omitted; b) an ethanol molecule of
solvation has been omitted; c) an oxygen and a nitro-
gen atom have been interchanged; d) the chemist is
uncertain if a terminal group is CN or NC; the crys-
tallographer is sent some data without an indication
as to whether they are F, F2 or I; somehow the user
loses 1/3 of the reﬂections during a ﬁle transfer without
getting a warning message.
a) The R-factor remains unexpectedly high, a differ-
ence map should show the additional atoms, the
ratio Fo/Fc is not approximately unity over the
whole Fo (or Fc) range, bond lengths in the rest of
the structure are distorted.
b) As above, but less evident.
c) The displacement parameters will be anomalous –
the N in place of O will have reduced parameters,
and vice versa
d) As above, but less evident, especially if there is
substantial motion.
e) The structure may well solve, but will not reﬁne.
Reﬁnement of F2 as F will lead to large displacement
parameters, and small ones for the opposite
confusion.
f) If the losses are random, there may be no evident
effect except that the observation-to-parameter ratio
will be low. Systematic loss of high- or low-angle
data will affect the displacement parameters. Loss
of data in a particular direction in reciprocal space
will lead to unusual adps.
8. For a material in P2221 we measure and keep separate
the h and the −h reﬂections. How does the number of
independent observations we have depend upon the
material and the diffraction experiment?
If the material contains any elements with substan-
tial anomalous scattering, the h and −h data must be
treated as individual, and the absolute conﬁguration
determined. If there are no strong anomalous scatter-
ers, h and −h cease to be independent, and can be either
kept separate or merged.
9. The 112 reﬂection for an ‘ordinary’ material has Fo =
10, Fc = 500. What should we do? If Fo were 400, what
should we expect?
If the R factor is reasonably low – say less than 15% –
there is a good probability that Fc is of the right order of
magnitude, and that there is something wrong with the
measurement of Fo. In the ﬁrst case it might possibly
be partially obscured by the beam-stop and so should
be discarded. In the second case it might be the effects
of extinction, and an extinction parameter should be
reﬁned.
10. Suggest different restraint regimes for PF−
6 under dif-
ferent patterns of disorder. Suggest some suitable
constraints.
Bond, angle and adp restraints, or rigid group con-
straints. If fully disordered, use group electron density
models (spherical shells or SQUEEZE).
11. Why do we bother ﬁddling with a) hydrogen atoms;
b) disordered solvent? Comment on different tech-
niques available for dealing with the problems.
a) We may have a scientiﬁc reason for wanting to
locate them. Even if not, approximate placement is
necessary since they contribute to Fc.
b) To keep referees happy, and to avoid substantial bias
in Fc.
12. Are there any reasons why a laboratory might want
both Cu and Mo data-collection capabilities?
The diffraction experiment is more efﬁcient with long
wavelengths, so smaller crystals can be used with Cu.
In general, Mo is less strongly absorbed, so larger crys-
tals containing absorbing elements can be handled.
The major reason is that usually anomalous dispersion
differences can be measured with Cu radiation from
materials containing only C, H, N and O, so that the
absolute conﬁguration can be determined from native
pharmaceutical (organic) materials.

Questions and answers
13. For a chirally pure material in P61, the Flack parame-
ter has an s.u. of 0.03 and a value of 0.98. What should
be done?
Ifthematerialisunquestionably chirallypure,ans.u.as
large as 0.1 can be safely used to evaluate the param-
eter. In this case the model needs inverting, and the
space group changing to P65.
14. Imagine a drug compound for which the diffractome-
ter proposes the space group I41. The Flack parameter
reﬁnes to about 1.0, with an s.u. of 0.01. What should
you do next?
A drug can be expected to be chiral, but there is always
risk of contamination by the opposite enantiomer. S.u.s
need to be below 0.04 to give a deﬁnitive answer. In
this case, the structure needs inverting and the space
group needs changing. Note that an origin shift is also
required (−x, 1/2 −y, −z in I43).
15. A novel inorganic phosphate in P21 gives a Flack
parameter of 0.47 and an s.u. of 0.40. What do we know
about the material? What would we know if the s.u.
was 0.05?
An s.u. of 0.5 means that the data contain no useful
anomalous scattering information, so we know noth-
ing about the hand of the structure. An s.u. of 0.05
means that there is a reasonable anomalous signal,
giving us conﬁdence in the calculated value of the
Flack parameter, which corresponds to a 50:50 twin by
inversion.
16. Give the relationship between the number of param-
eters and execution time in least squares.
In the matrix accumulation every derivative in the
matrix must be multiplied by every other derivative,
so the time is proportional to n2. Matrix inversion
depends on the method but is generally of the order
of n3.
17. Explain the derivation of the symmetry constraints
for the parameters of atoms on special positions.
x′ = R.x + t. If x′ = x the atom has folded back onto
itself, and so is on a special position. Try with operator
x, −y, z an atom at 0.3, 0.5, 0.3.
18. Why does the least-squares-determined scale factor
(k.Fc = Fo) rarely make Fo = Fc?
Least-squares minimises w(Yo −k.Yc)2, i.e. is a
quadratic function, while Fo = k is linear.
19. Why is the Hamilton ‘R’ factor usually higher than
the conventional ‘R’ factor?
The Hamilton weighted R factor (which should always
be used in statistical tests) depends on the weights and
uses the coefﬁcient (Yo −Yc)2, rather than moduli,
which are statistically difﬁcult to handle. The square
of a large residual is a very large number.
20. What is ‘the variance of a reﬂection of unit weight’?
This is the square of the ‘goodness of ﬁt’ deﬁned by
S2 = ([w(Yo −Yc)2])/(n −m), with n observations
and m variables. The squared observations may also
be used.
Note that this can easily be ﬁddled by ﬁddling the
weights, ﬁddling the number of reﬂections used, or
leaving out of m any parameters that were reﬁned in
previous cycles, but not in the last.
21. What is the effect of unaveraged reﬂections (multiple
observations) on least-squares reﬁnement?
There is no objection to the use of unaveraged reﬂec-
tions provided that they are correctly weighted. The
weight is (theoretically) proportional to the inverse of
the variance, and while averaging reﬂections reduces
the number of observations used in the reﬁnement,
the variance of the average will be reduced, so that
its weight may be increased. It is therefore possible to
mix averaged and unaveraged data. This is not true for
Fourier calculations.
22. What is the effect on R and bond length s.u.s of
ignoring ‘weak’ reﬂections?
Sketch R versus Fo, and number of reﬂections versus
Fo. A large number of weak reﬂections usually raises
the R factor, but has no substantial effect on positional
parameters. They may affect displacement parameters,
and are important for the determination of absolute
conﬁguration (sketch variation of f and f′′ versus θ, and
⟨I⟩versus θ). They are also important for distinguish-
ing centrosymmetric and non–centrosymmetric space
groups.

23. What is the effect on R and bond length s.u.s of
anisotropic reﬁnement?

Questions and answers
367
Reﬁnement is of parameters against Yo −Yc, where Yc
isbasedonthecurrentmodel.Ifthemodelistoosimple,
Yc cannot be computed to correspond to Yo, so Yo −Yc
must be incorrect. The remaining parameters may take
on invalid values. R should decrease as the model has
more degrees of freedom. Bond-length s.u.s are related
to the ‘goodness of ﬁt’, and will decrease if the resid-
ual (Yo −Yc) drops more rapidly than the number of
degrees of freedom, (n−m). Note that, if too many new
parameters are introduced into a reﬁnement, the anal-
ysis becomes ‘under–determined’, and the parameters
may take on unrealistic values. Chemical or physical
restraints may be useful.
24. What is the effect on R and bond-length s.u.s of using
block diagonal reﬁnement?
Bond-length s.u.s depend on atomic variances and
covariances. Block diagonal reﬁnements exclude the
covariances, so that molecular parameter s.u.s are usu-
ally underestimated. Note that, even if the reﬁnement
is correctly performed, geometry programs may leave
out the covariances. Block diagonal reﬁnement is more
prone to falling into false minima.
25. What is the effect on R and bond-length s.u.s of
missing solvent molecules?
As in 23 above, an inappropriate or incomplete model
will adversely affect the remaining parameters. If sol-
vent can be modelled by discrete atoms (i.e. is not
seriously disordered), then that sort of model may be
used. If the disorder is more severe, then multiply dis-
ordered pseudo-atoms may be used to try to model the
diffuse electron density in the disordered region (as in
SHELXL97), or the discrete Fourier transform of the
region may be computed and added to the values of
Fc computed from the atomic model. The important
thing is to add into Yc as much as is reasonable, since
reﬁnement is against Yo −Yc, not just simply Yo.
Matrix
26. What are the design matrix and the normal matrix?
The design matrix encodes the relationship between
the unknown parameters and the conditions at which
observations are made. In crystallography it is difﬁcult
to predict in advance which observations will be most
useful, so it is usual to measure all ‘observable’ reﬂec-
tions. This usually means up to the diffractometer’s θ
limit for Cu radiation, but the operator must generally
choose a limit for Mo radiation. Don’t stop collecting
data just because you ‘have enough’ reﬂections. You
don’t yet know which will be important. The normal
matrix is a transform of these data, and shortcomings
in the choice of reﬂections to measure (which may also
include the consequences of the choice of a wrong crys-
tal system, or pseudo-symmetry) become apparent in
processing this matrix.
27. What are some uses in crystallography of the eigen-
values and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix?
Ellipsoids are common features in crystallography (e.g.
atomic-displacement parameters, formerly known as
anisotropic temperature factors). In their normal form
(arbitrarily orientated and evaluated with respect to a
non-orthogonal co-ordinate system) they are difﬁcult
to visualize. The eigenvalues of the tensor representa-
tion of the ellipsoid are a measure of the principal axes,
and the eigenvectors are a measure of the orientation
of these axes. A rare use (found in some versions of
ORFLS, and in CRYSTALS) is in the inversion of the
normal matrix. More common uses are in the solution
of the equations in DIFABS, and in TLS analysis. Both
of these procedures involve the analysis of systems
in which the user may be unaware of exactly which
variables are important. Matrix inversion involving
selection of eigenvalues often automatically selects the
most appropriate parameters for evaluation.
28. What is the ‘riding’ model in parameter reﬁnement?
‘Riding’ reﬁnement is usually associated with the
reﬁnement of hydrogen atoms. In the crudest imple-
mentations the associated heavy-atom co-ordinate
shifts are computed, and the same shifts applied to the
hydrogen atoms. (Sketch this, and deduce the effect on
bond angles.) In better implementations, the deriva-
tives of the heavy atom and the hydrogen atom are
added together, and composite shifts computed and
applied to the parameters, so that all riding atoms
contribute to the computed shift. However, the con-
cept can be applied to any parameter combinations,
so that it is simple to construct ‘fragment’ anisotropic
displacement parameters, in which all the atoms in a
fragment have the same Uaniso values. Imagine some
other situations, including ones in which the deriva-
tives are inverted in sign before being added into the
normal equations.
29. How can the problem of pseudo-doubled cells be
ameliorated?
If, by accident, a cell parameter is taken to be twice
its true value, then on solution of the structure two
motifs will be found lying parallel to that direction,
with co-ordinates differing by exactly 1/2. Reﬁnement
will be difﬁcult because the ‘independent’ parame-
ters are in fact 100% correlated. The situation should
become clear because of the absence of reﬂections in the
odd layers perpendicular to that direction. Situations

368
Questions and answers
exist in which the reﬂections in these planes are not
absent, but just very weak, indicating that the cor-
responding atoms are not separated by exactly half
a cell. Reﬁnement may be possible using eigenvalue
ﬁltering, or by transforming the co-ordinate system,
x′ = x1 +x2, x′′ = x1 −x2, and reﬁning the transformed
co-ordinates. Sketch a contour of constant minimiza-
tion function versus two uncorrelated parameters, and
versus two highly correlated parameters, and indicate
how the correlation may be reduced.
Errors in data
Discuss:
30. the symptoms of applying the Lp correction twice, or
not at all;
(L = 1/ sin(2θ), p = 1/2(1 + cos2(2θ).) Sketch the Lp cor-
rection versus θ, and ⟨I⟩versus θ. Sketch f, an atomic
scattering factor, and exp(−U sin θ) for small U.
31. the effect of neglecting reﬂections with negative net
intensity;
Goodness-of-ﬁt S2 = (w2)/(n −m), n = number
of observations, m = number of variables. Sketch his-
togram of number of reﬂections versus I/σ(I) (often
masses of weak reﬂections). What about weights of
weak reﬂections? (Generally very small.) Very negative
reﬂections are probably outliers.
32. the effect on structural parameters of ignoring
absorption effects;
Reﬁnement is of parameters against Yo−Yc. If there is a
systematic error in Yo then the model will be modiﬁed
to try to model this error. This will only be valid if the
model contains appropriate parameters (e.g. DIFABS),
otherwise other parameters may be perturbed in an
unpredictable way.
33. the effect of ignoring the θ-dependent component of
the absorption correction;
Sketch I(= Io exp(−μt)) and compare with isotropic
displacement parameter sketch in 1 above. Sketch

Failure to apply the correction makes low-angle reﬂections too
weak (i.e., high-angle too strong after scaling) which depresses the
temperature factors.
34. the

introduced
by
ignoring
anomalous
dispersion;
Even in centrosymmetric structures there is a phase
shift (phase angles not exactly 0 or 180◦) so parameters
are incorrect if f′′ is ignored. Particularly important are
polar space groups. Note that if f′ or f′′ are large and
omitted, the adps will be affected, possibly leading to
failure of the Hirshfeld test.
35. ‘robust–resistant’ reﬁnement.
Robust implies that the reﬁnement produces useful
estimates of the parameter variances for a wide range
of (possibly unknown) distributions of errors in the
data. Resistant implies that the reﬁnement is insensi-
tive to a concentration of errors in a small subset of the
data. Robust/resistant reﬁnements converge to a ‘best’
model.
Origin ﬁxing
36. Give example of space groups with origins not ﬁxed
in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.
See also 34 above. P41, Pm, P1.
37. Give three methods of ﬁxing the origin in P1 in least
squares.
a) Hold all three co-ordinates of one atom (preferably
heavy) unreﬁned.
b) Keep the centre of gravity of the structure ﬁxed (i.e.
(x) = 0).
c) Invert the normal matrix using eigenvalue ﬁltering.
38. How do these three methods affect atomic parameter
s.u.s?
a) The unreﬁned atom has zero s.u.s, other atoms have
increased s.u.s. There will be signiﬁcant covariances
between atoms.
b) The s.u.s are correctly distributed, and have the cor-
rect covariances between directions and between
atoms.
c) As in b.
39. How do these three methods affect molecular param-
eter (e.g. bond length) s.u.s?
a) Molecular parameter s.u.s will be correct if (and
only if) the full covariance matrix is used in their
computation.
b) As in 38b above, but the reduced covariance terms
mean that ‘fair’ s.u.s may sometimes be computed
from co-ordinate s.u.s alone.
c) As in 38c above.

Questions and answers

Centres of symmetry
40. What is the effect of reﬁning a centrosymmetric
structure in a non–centrosymmetric space group?
There is always high correlation between related
atoms, which will lead to a singular or near-singular
matrix. Molecular parameters (bond lengths) are often
‘curious’.
41. Why are pseudo-symmetric structures difﬁcult to
reﬁne?
There is high correlation between related parameters,
so that the matrix inversion is unreliable, and param-
eters may shift to unreasonable but complementary
values. See 29 above.

43. Discussusesinreﬁnementofaweightingschemethat

The low-order reﬂections depend only on the gross

may help in the initial development of a structure.
44. Under what conditions will F and F2 reﬁnements
converge to the same parameter values?
Only if the weights used are suitable (w′ = w/2F2).
However, it is worth asking why we should aim for the

The rigid groups cannot ﬂex during the reﬁnement, so
they cannot adapt to ﬁne changes in structure due to
chemical or physical effects.
48. What is reﬁnement using rigid-body RESTRAINTS?
Estimates are made of the likely values for molecu-
lar parameters (bond lengths, angle, planarity, etc.)
together with estimates of possible deviations from
these values, and these estimates are used as supple-
mental observations to guide the reﬁnement.
49. List some uses of this technique.
As in 46 above, with the addition that more or less ﬂex-
ibility can be built into the group depending on the
target molecular parameters and their estimated valid-
ity. Totally rigid bodies can be simulated by sufﬁcient
very tightly deﬁned restraints.
50. List some problems with this technique.
Almost none, except that the size of the normal
matrix is not reduced. If the restraints are assigned
very small uncertainties, derived parameter uncertain-
ties may be anomalously small. PLATON will spot
this.
51. What are similarity restraints, and how are they used?
Similarity restraints require that atomic or molecular
parameters in a structure should have similar values,
but without knowing in advance what these values are;
e.g. displacement parameters of bonded atoms should
have similar values, and bonds in similar environments
should have similar lengths.
Absolute conﬁguration
52. Give three methods for the determination of absolute
conﬁguration.
a) Comparing the signs of the differences of very care-
fully measured Friedel pairs of reﬂections with the
computed Bijvoet differences.
b) Comparing the weighted R factor of a reﬁned
structure with that of its opposite enantiomer.
c) ReﬁnementoftheRogersη parameter,whichshould
take the value 1 if the model has the correct hand,
otherwise −1.
d) Reﬁnement of the Flack ‘enantiopole’ parameter,
which has the value 0 if the model is of the correct
hand, otherwise 1.
53. Is inverting the co-ordinates of all atoms always suf-
ﬁcient to correct an error in enantiomer assignment?
No. There are pairs of space groups in which the space
group must also be changed if the hand of the model
is changed (e.g. P41 and P43).

Questions and answers
Standard uncertainties
54. Why can we NOT compute reliable molecular param-
eter s.u.s from atomic parameter s.u.s only?
The s.u.s on x, y and z do not contain information
about the correlation between the uncertainties for the
parameters of a single atom, nor for the correlation
between atoms. In the event of correlation (which is
inevitable in non–orthogonal unit cells, in the case of
pseudo-symmetry and polar space groups, and when
constraints or restraints are used), molecular parameter
s.u.s are miscalculated.

1. As part of an undergraduate practical class a student
was asked to record powder diffraction patterns of the
compounds BaS and SrSe, both of which have the rock
salt structure. Ionic radii (Å) are Ba 1.49, Sr 1.32, S
1.70, Se 1.84. Unfortunately, the student has forgotten
to label the patterns (which are shown in Fig. 14.13).
Can you help?
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the ionic radii are such that
the two compounds will have similar cell parameters.
For rock salt you would expect the cubic cell param-
eter to be twice the sum of the ionic radii (6.38 and
6.32 Å). Given the uncertainty in additivities of ionic
radii, peak positions in the powder pattern will not
help desperately. You could calculate where you would
expect reﬂections for these cell parameters and therefore
index the powder pattern. d2
hkl = a2/(h2 + k2 + l2). The
peaks expected (for a cell parameter of 6.359 Å and F
centring) are:

Alternatively, you could start with the experimental
data and index the pattern by hand (easiest way is to
make a table of 1/d2 values and look for ratios to deter-
mine h2 +k2 +l2). The table below contains the relevant

In the case of SrSe the only peaks observed are 002, 022,
222, 044, 042, 422, 044. One could therefore index the
whole pattern on a primitive cubic cell of a = 3.18 Å.
This is an example of how X-rays can give misleading
answers. This is because the scattering factors for Sr2+
(atomic number 38) and Se2−(atomic number 34) are
essentially identical. You can explain this by sketching
a plan view of the rock salt structure and then shading
both atoms the same colour (‘colour-blind X-rays’). You
could also work through structure-factor calculations,
which for rock salt end up as:
h, k, l all even, Fhkl = 4(f+ + f−)
h, k, l all odd, Fhkl = 4(f+ −f−)
1 odd, 2 even or 2 even, 1 odd, Fhkl = 0.
This shows directly why certain reﬂections disappear if
the scattering power of cation (f+) and anion (f−) are
identical.
2. The structure of MnRe2O8 has been reported in space
group P¯3 with unit cell parameters a = b = 5.8579 Å,
c = 6.0665 Å and fractional co-ordinates as shown in
Table 14.3 (next page). Draw a plan view of the struc-
ture and determine the co-ordination environment of
Mn and Re atoms. Given bond distances of 2.179 Å for
Mn1–O1, 1.704 Å for both Re1–O1 and Re1–O2 and Rij
values of 1.79 and 1.97 Å for Mn(II)/Re(VII), determine
bond-valence sums for Mn and Re. Do you think the
published structure is correct? What error could have
been made when solving/reﬁning the structure?

probably is. MnRe2O8 can be described as MnO6 octa-
hedra, which share corners with ReO4 tetrahedra. It
might help to think of an octahedron in terms of two
staggered triangles (one above and one below the plane
of the metal). The octahedra are then generated directly
by the ¯3 site on which Mn sits.

Clearly these values are not particularly good. This is
a classic case in which the oxygen positions are hard to
determine in the presence of heavy-metal atoms, partic-
ularly as this structure was determined from laboratory
X-ray data. One problem you might notice with a half-
decent sketch is that the published structure is very close
to having more symmetry than expected for P¯3. In par-
ticular, youshould be able to spot an approximate mirror
plane (in the 2nd ﬁgure you have rectangles between
polyhedra, not parallelograms). In fact, X-ray/neutron
studies on closely related materials have shown that
their symmetry is P¯3m1. This would require O1 to be on
the mirror plane (an x, 2x type position). It is not far off
that in the co-ordinate table above! In the related better-
characterized structures this oxygen atom is found at
(0.166, 0.332, z). P¯3m1 diagram below.

3. As described in Case history 2, the structure of
Mo2P4O15 was originally described using an incorrect
unit cell with a = 8.3065, b = 6.5154, c = 10.7102 Å, β =
106.695◦, V = 555.20 Å3. From the information below
calculate the transformation matrix required to convert
to the correct cell. Calculate the volume of the true cell.
A classic transformation matrix problem. From the
reﬂection lists given it should be clear to the reader
that there are often lots of possible choices for which
reﬂections might be equivalent – especially if one cell
is large so reﬂections are closely spaced in d. Here, it
should be obvious from the intensities which reﬂections
are equivalent for the ﬁrst two reﬂections. If you notice
that there is a 2:6:1 approximate relationship between
the supercell reﬂection intensities you should be able to
decide that (4,6,−6) is equivalent to (2,2,−2) rather than

the P–O–P bond angle has to be linear. However, P–
O–P linkages should be bent, like the water molecule
H2O, because of lone pairs on the O atom. It is there-
fore unlikely that the published structure is completely
correct. Either the authors could have missed a super-
structure (which would allow P–O–P to bend) or the
oxygen is disordered around the published position.

1. The following (top of the next page) was given in
the output of CELL_NOW after indexing a twinned
crystal. The twin law is described as a two-fold rota-
tion about the reciprocal lattice vector (1 0 0) and the
direct lattice vector [3 0 1] (which is parallel to [1 0
1/3]). Show that these are equivalent descriptions of the
same vector.
Direct and reciprocal lattice vectors are transformed to
each other using the metric tensors:
• to transform reciprocal lattice axes to direct
lattice axes use G (i.e. A = GA*);
• to transform reciprocal lattice vector compo-
nents to direct lattice vector components use
G* (formally G*T, but G* is symmetric);
• to transform direct lattice axes to reciprocal
lattice axes use G* (i.e. A* = G*A);
• to transform direct lattice vector components

Hence, the [3 0 1] direct lattice direction is the same
as the (1 0 0) reciprocal lattice direction, as shown in
the CELL_NOW output. Note that when specifying a
direction the length of the vector is immaterial, and the
components can be multiplied by any common factor.
2. A structure has been solved in Pna21, but symme-
try checking shows that the correct space group is
Pnma. What matrices should be used to transform the
reﬂection indices and the co-ordinates?
In going from Pna21 to Pnma the a-glide changes from
being perpendicular to b to being perpendicular to c,
while the n-glide remains perpendicular to the a-axis.
Therefore, the required transformation will do some-
thing like this:
a (Pnma) = a (Pna21)
b (Pnma) = c (Pna21)
c (Pnma) = b (Pna21),
for which the matrix would be
⎛
⎝

⎠.
However, this matrix has a determinant of −1, meaning
that we would have changed from a right-handed axis
set to a left-handed one, and this is not allowed. The
problem can be solved by simply converting one of the
entries 1 into −1:

thought that s.u.s are underestimated. Strict adherence
to the ‘3σ-rule’ is dangerous, and one might look for a 5σ

8. Discuss the placement of H-atoms on (i) terminal
hydroxyl groups; (ii) ligating water molecules; (iii)
unco-ordinated molecules of water of crystallization.
One answer to all parts is to ﬁnd the H atoms in a differ-
ence map, or do a neutron-diffraction experiment. These
may not be possible, of course. Another option is not
to place the offending H atoms at all. Otherwise, geo-
metrical considerations have to be used, but this still
leaves the orientations of O–H bonds ambiguous, apart
from the expected bond angles at O. For a terminal OH
group, positions could be considered that make it stag-
gered with respect to whatever is bonded to it. Possible
hydrogen-bonding interactions should also be investi-
gated in each case, and these may help to deﬁne a unique
orientation.

(a) Calculate the weighted value of χ2 and χ2
red using
wi = 1/σ 2(xi).
From the table on page 376 χ2 = 11245. The number
of degrees of freedom is 13 −1 = 12, so χ2
red = 937.
(b) Is calculation of a mean justiﬁed for these data?
Discuss your answer in terms of the likely effects
of environmental factors on hydrogen bonds.
937 is a long way from 1.0, and so the data are not
drawn from the same parent distribution, and envi-
ronmental effects are important. This is expected as
H-bond distances are likely to be strongly depen-
dent on ‘environmental effects’ such as the pKa of
the HX group.
(c) Your supervisor looks blank when you tell him
about χ2, and says that you must calculate an aver-
age. What standard deviation should you quote?
The mean is 24.055/13 = 1.85. σ 2 = 0.154/12, so
σ = 0.11.

What response might be given?
Restraints increase correlation between parameters, and
so off-diagonal terms in the inverse normal matrix
must be taken into account. CHECKCIF does not have
access to these, though, and bases its calculation on the
variances only.
5. In a particular structure determination the bond angles
in a nitrate anion were found to be 120.1(2), 119.4(2) and
119.5(2)◦. What is the sum of the angles and its s.u.?
σ 2(f) = σ 2(x1) + σ 2(x2) + · · · .
The sum is therefore 359.0(4)◦.
6. Bond angles in a substituted cyclopropane ring are
reported as 59.3(2), 59.6(2), 61.0(2) . What is the sum
of the angles and its s.u.?
180◦with an uncertainty of exactly zero. The sum of the
angles in a triangle must come to 180◦– this question
illustrates the danger of excluding correlations. Note
that the angles in question 5 are also highly correlated
(though the sum does not have to be exactly 360◦, unless
the group lies on an appropriate symmetry element),
so the s.u. calculated by the simple formula is almost
certainly over-estimated.

1. Graphite is a layered material that undergoes interca-
lationchemistrywithalkalimetals.Theﬁrsttworeﬂec-
tions in the powder diffraction patterns of graphite
and a K intercalation compound were observed at
26.58/54.76◦and 16.56/33.47◦2θ, respectively. Calculate
d-spacings for each reﬂection and suggest hkl indices.
Why are only certain classes of hkl reﬂections typically
seen in powder diffraction patterns of these materi-
als? How might you try to observe other reﬂections?
(λ = 1.54 Å).
d-Spacings should be 3.35 and 1.675 and 5.35/2.675
Å for graphite and the intercalation compound. Note
that 26.6◦is the setting angle you need for a graphite
monochromator in powder diffraction (and therefore
the angle that would appear in any Lp correction). You
should be able to index the reﬂections as 001/002. In fact,
graphite has space group P63/mmc so the reﬂections are
002/004. Graphite will show extreme preferred orien-
tation in a ﬂat-plate reﬂection powder pattern as the
plate-like crystals will lie with their c-axes perpendic-
ular to the sample holder, meaning only (00l) reﬂections
are seen. If you run a ﬂat-plate transmission experiment
you would see (hk0) reﬂections. It is essentially impos-
sible to make a ‘good’ powder sample of a material
like this. Capillary measurements or spray drying might
help.Graphitealsoshowsturbostraticdisordersuchthat
there is little order along the stacking axis. You therefore
see broad, asymmetric peaks in the powder pattern.

inorganic materials recorded with λ = 1.54 Å. Index

This pattern is of NaxWO3, which is essentially cubic:
dhkl= a/(h2 + k2 + l2)1/2. You should produce a table
of d and 1/d2 as above and divide each 1/d2 value by
the value for the ﬁrst peak (0.06816). This assumes the
ﬁrst peak is (100) and gives you values of (h2 + k2 + l2)
for every other peak. You should be able to assign hkl
values to give these sums. Note that 9 is given by (300)
or (221); these peaks will overlap perfectly.

Table for Exercise 3.
The peaks at 38, 44 and 82◦are due to the Al sample
holder used for the experiment. You might be able to
guess this from the fact that, e.g., the 82◦peak is so
strong (normally intensities fall off with 2θ). You may
be able to index the Al peaks as well. Al is fcc so you
only expect all odd/all even hkl combinations. Indexing
of the Al peaks is included in the table above.
The second pattern is Y2O3, which is body centred
(Ia3). If you try the same method for WO3, and assume
the ﬁrst peak is (100) you will get stuck when you ﬁnd
that the second reﬂection has a ratio of 1.5. If you dou-
ble the value of all ratios it is the same as saying the ﬁrst
peak is 110 (h2+k2+l2 = 2) and not 100. You will then be
able to index reﬂections until the fourth peak, for which
h2 + k2 + l2 is 7 (for which there are no valid indices). To
getroundthisyouhavetomultiplytheratioby4instead.
This is the same as assuming the ﬁrst peak is (200). If
you then index everything you will see that reﬂections
observed all have h +k +l even – the condition for body
centring. To save time just work with the ﬁrst 10 peaks.
3. For the second example of exercise 2 calculate the cell
parameter from each reﬂection indexed. Which data
shouldbeusedtoobtainprecisecellparameters?Why?
Use a = d(h2 + k2 + l2)1/2. For accurate cell parameters
it is best to use high 2θ values. Many systematic errors
(e.g. zero point) are linear in 2θ −d-spacing is not! From
a table like the one above you should be able to see that
cell parameters converge to an approximately consistent
value for the high-angle data. The Rietveld-reﬁned cell
parameter of this sample is 10.602 Å.
The following graphs plot this for both data sets.
Rietveld reﬁnement for the NaxWO3 example suggests
that the sample was actually mounted with a height
error of 0.16 mm and had a cell parameter of 3.8548 Å.
Peak shapes also show the material is probably actually
tetragonal.

4. What
experimental
factors
can
cause
systematic
errors in cell parameter determination? How would
one obtain the most precise and most accurate cell
parameters possible?
2θ zero errors; sample height errors; sample absorption
leading to an effective height error; axial divergence
leading to peak asymmetry causes peak maxima not to
be in the correct place; α1/α2 splitting is not resolved at
low 2θ and is at high 2θ so be careful when peak picking;
temperature errors; the best way is to use an internal
standard (e.g. NBS Si) that has a known cell parameter
and calibrate accordingly.

octahedral FeII complex (Fig. 17.10) at six different
temperatures. Comment on these data.
These data show a phase transition in an iron co-
ordination compound as it undergoes a high-spin to
low-spin phase transition (FeII d6). From the powder
data you should be able to infer that there are no major
structuralchangesthatoccurasintensitiesdonotchange
hugely. With good-quality data one should be able to
reﬁne a change in Fe–L bond distances but the intensity
changes would not be noticeable by eye. You should be
able to plot a very rough sketch of thermal expansion
from the peak d-spacings given and convince yourself
that it is a ﬁrst-order transition, as there is an abrupt
change in volume at the transition. You would expect
to see hysteresis in the cell volume as a function of
temperature as it is ﬁrst-order.
6. Use the Scherrer formula (Section 17.4.3) to obtain a
crude estimate of the size of the crystalline domains
in Figs. 17.5(a) and (b).
The values derived from whole-pattern ﬁtting using an
empirical instrumental function and convoluting terms
to describe size broadening are given in the text.
Approximate sizes can be derived from the ﬁgure and
the Scherrer equation. For Fig. 17.5(a) the peak width is
around 4◦, which is 0.070 radians. Assuming the peak
is at 2θ = 40◦the formula gives 21 Å or around 2 nm.
For (b) the width is around 1◦or 0.0175 radians, giving
a size of 84.5 Å or 8.5 nm. These data are veriﬁed by
TEM measurements (see below), suggesting one has
single-domain nanoparticles.

1. To which point groups do the following space groups
belong?
P1, P21/c, P212121, Cmca, I4, P3121, R3m,
P63/mmc, Pa3?
P1, 1; P21/c, 2/m; P212121, 222; Cmca, mmm; I4, 4;
P3121, 321; R3m, 3m; P63/mmc, 6/mmm; Pa3, m3.
2. Explain why it is often stated that a low value for
⟨|E2 −1|⟩can indicate twinning. What values of this
parameter are expected for untwinned structures, and
what values might be expected for a twinned struc-
ture? Under what circumstances might this parameter
be misleading?
Es are Fs corrected for ﬁnite atomic size and vibrational
motion. Wilson statistics show that, if a structure is cen-
trosymmetric, then ⟨|E2 −1|⟩is expected to be about
0.97; if it is non-centrosymmetric then this parameter
should be about 0.74. A twin might have a value 0.2 or
so below these values, although this varies from system
to system. Avalue of 0.4 would look suspicious. Reason:
twinning causes reﬂections to overlap, thus averaging
their intensities out a little; this gives a low ⟨|E2 −1|⟩
value. Wilson statistics assume a random distribution of
scattering power in the unit cell. If this is not the case,
e.g. in a heavy-atom structure, the value of ⟨|E2 −1|⟩
may be much lower than expected. Consider α-Po for
example: Po scatters into all reﬂections and ⟨|E2−1|⟩is
zero!
3. Suggest twin laws that might arise from structures
with the following unit cells. In each case state which
reﬂections would be affected and what features would
help diagnose the twinning.
(a) Monoclinic, with β ∼90◦.
(b) Monoclinic P with a ∼c.
(c) Orthorhombic with two edges approximately
equal.
a) Pseudo-orthorhombic and so 2-fold rotations about a
and c, and mirrors perpendicular to a and c would work.
Only the 2-fold axes would be relevant if the compound
were chirally pure. A 2-fold rotation about a would be
(1 0 0 / 0 −1 0/ 0 0 −1). All reﬂections would overlap, so
this would not be spotted at the data-collection stage. If
the twin scale factor was 50% the Laue symmetry would
appear to be mmm. Merging in mmm would get progres-
sively worse as the scale factor drops. Just how much
worse it gets can be used to estimate the scale factor. If
this information is available and the scale factor is sig-
niﬁcantly less than 0.5 an attempt can be made to untwin
the data set and so solve the structure. There would be
problems determining the space group if orthorhombic
symmetry was assumed. For example, if the true space
group was P21, assumption of orthorhombic symmetry
would imply space group P2212 (no absences along a*
or c*), which is rather unusual. A low ⟨|E2 −1|⟩value
may indicate twinning. The structure would probably
be difﬁcult to solve, especially if no heavy atoms were
present. A Patterson search would be well worth a try.
b) This cell can be transformed into orthorhombic C.
A 2-fold axis along the [101] direction would work:

⎛

⎠=

⎠.
All reﬂections affected, and so the comments made
above apply. Note that if the space group were P21/c
the (h0l) absences would overlap with (l0h) reﬂections
from the other domain, and so the space group would
appear to be P21.
c) Pseudo-tetragonal, and so a 4-fold rotation about
one axis or a 2-fold rotation about the square-face
diagonal would work. All data are affected.
4. Consider a triclinic crystal structure with a unit cell
with approximately orthorhombic metric symmetry.
(a) How many domains are possible if the crystal
forms a twin and the space group is P1?
The lattice has mmm symmetry (order = 8), the
point group of the crystal structure is only 1 (order
2). Therefore four domains are possible.
(b) What twin laws are possible if the space group is
P1?
Two-fold rotations about the three unit cell axes
would generate mmm.
(c) How many domains are possible if the space group
is P1?
If the crystal structure belongs to point group 1 then
in principle eight domains are possible. If the mate-
rial is enantiopure, however, inversions and mirrors
are not allowed, so the number of domains would
still be 4.
5. In Example 6 a mirror perpendicular to [100] was used
to model twinning. Write down in matrix form the

All the transformed indices (which correspond to

The transformed indices are integral only when l = 3n.
So only l = 0, ±3, ±6 . . . layers will be affected.
7. Suggest twin laws that might arise from structures
with the following unit cells. In each case state which
reﬂections would be affected and what features would
help diagnose the twinning.
(a) Orthorhombic P, a = 4.49, b = 16.74, c = 9.01 Å.
(b) Monoclinic P, a = 5.50, b = 11.49, c = 6.34 Å,
β = 98.3◦.
(a) Notice that c ∼2a, so there is a pseudo-tetragonal
supercell. There are various possibilities for the symme-
try element of this; if we use the 4-fold rotation (about
b), the twin law would be:
⎛
⎝

⎠.
Thus, the l = 2n data are affected. Probably the crys-
tal would appear to be tetragonal at the data-collection
stage, but, provided the scale factor was signiﬁcantly
less than 0.5, pseudo-translational symmetry would be
evident in the dataset.
(b) It is much harder to see this one by inspection.
Actually, most monoclinic twins are affected by 2-fold
rotations about a and c. The matrices for these are given
in Chapter 18, so a good strategy is to work out the ratios
–2acosβ/c and –2ccosβ/a. If either is nearly rational then
the corresponding rotation is a likely twin law. Here,
−2a cos β/c = −0.25 and −2c cos β/a = −0.33, and both
are nearly rational (−1/4 and −1/3). The matrix for a 2-fold
rotation about a is (1 0 0/ 0 −1 0/ −0.33 0 −1). This will
affect the h = 3n data. That for a 2-fold rotation about
c is: (−1 0 −0.25/ 0 −1 0/ 0 0 1). This would affect the
l = 4n data.
These could be distinguished by looking at the poorly
ﬁtting data. If these tend to have h = 3n then the ﬁrst
matrix is likely, if they have l = 4n the second is more
likely. A twin like this would probably be difﬁcult to
index. The simplest method here is to allow your index-
ing program to tell you what the twin law is! However, if
the data are from a four-circle diffractometer where the
initial search found only a few reﬂections and the scale
factor is small, this might not work.

Use a twin-indexing package such as CELL_NOW.

XPREP output for oxalyl chloride
c = 16.676(11) Å. The following (table above) was
found assuming orthorhombic symmetry using
XPREP. Show that these data are consistent with
the correct space group being P21/c with a = 16.67,
b = 5.34, c = 7.26 Å, β = 90◦.
There are absences in the 0kl (k odd, b–) and h00 (21–)
index classes. The absences in the –21– class are just
a subset of the former. These absences do not cor-
respond to any orthorhombic space group, but do
correspond to the monoclinic space group P21/b11.
This is just a non-standard setting of P21/c, with the
new b = old a and new c = old a.
(d) Calculate Z′ and comment on the mean value ⟨|E2−
1|⟩= 1.327.
The volume of the cell is 646.3 Å3. Applying the
18 Å3 rule gives six molecules per cell. This is rel-
atively unusual, though not impossible here, as the
oxalyl chloride molecule is centrosymmetric, and so
Z′ = 1.5 is possible. The value of ⟨|E2 −1|⟩is unusu-
ally high, and implies a distribution comprising both
strong data and weak (or absent) data.
(e) A Patterson map calculated using the second cell
given in part (c) showed a very strong non-origin
peak at [1/3 0 2/3]. Suggest a transformation to a

(f) What are the dimensions of this smaller cell?
From the ﬁgure above
a′ = length of the vector (1/3 0 −1/3) = [(16.67/3)2+
(7.26/3)2]1/2 = 6.06 Å
b′ = b = 5.34 Å
c′ = c = 7.26 Å.
β can be obtained from the dot product
(a/3 −c/3).c = a.c/3 −c.c/3
= (16.67 × 7.26 × cos 90)/3 −(7.262/3)
= 0 −(7.262/3)
= 6.06 × 7.26 × cos β
so β = 113.5◦.
(g) The structure of oxalyl chloride was successfully
modelled as a twin. What is the likely twin law?
The likely twin law is a two-fold rotation about the
a- or c-axis of the larger pseudo-orthorhombic cell.
This can be expressed on the axes of the small
