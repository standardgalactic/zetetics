Computation with Assemblies of Neurons
Santosh Vempala

How does the Mind 
emerge from the Brain? 
Mind the Gap                 
Despite accelerating progress in neuroscience
and increasing insight in cognitive science,
an overarching theory remains elusive

“…we do not have a logic for 
the transformation of neural 
activity into thought ... I view 
discerning [this] logic as the 
most important future 
direction of neuroscience…”
Richard Axel, Neuron, Sep 2018

So, what kind of formal theory 
would qualify as Axel’s “logic”?

Les Valiant’s theory 
of neuroids
and memory
items [ca 1995]


our story  (C.P. + S.V.)
• In 2014, we decided to study the brain
• In 2015 we wrote our first Theory papers on this
•Then in 2016 we got feedback from
people who knew some neuroscience
•In 2017 we started working on ”the logic”

So, what are we looking for?
• a computational system 
• consistent with current understanding of the brain
• explains cognitive phenomena

So, what are we looking for?
• a computational system 
• consistent with current understanding of the brain
• explains cognitive phenomena
• what are the basic data types and the basic 
operations?

Computation in the brain: 
What is the right level? 
• Whole brain?
• Spiking neurons and synapses?
• Dendrites?
• Molecules?
?

The Assembly Calculus
• A formal probabilistic model of the brain 
• A basic data type
• Basic operations
• A completeness theorem
• A killer app (language)

A mathematical model of the brain
Finite number of brain regions
Each contains n neurons
Inhibition: only k fire (selection)
Some pairs of areas are 
connected by directed Bn,p
(= bipartite Gn,p)
All are recurrently connected
by directed Gn,p

The model (cont.)
Neurons fire in discrete steps
The k neurons with highest input 
are selected to fire (RP&C)
Connections between areas can
be inhibited/disinhibited
Plasticity: If ij, i fires and in the
next step j fires, the weight of 
ij is multiplied by (1 + β)
Also: homeostasis, forgetting,…

Main parameters, intended values
• n ~  107
• k ~  103 - 4
• p  ~  0.001
• β  ~  0.10
Main ideas: randomness, selection, plasticity
Basic operation:  RP&C
online simulator available

OK, how realistic is it?
• For a formal model of the brain, quite
• The discrete steps assumption is certainly unrealistic, 
but we believe that it is not distortive
• Plasticity and assemblies used in a rapid time scale
• We believe that it is a productive compromise 
between realism, rigor, and usefulness

So, back to the question:
• What is the basic data type?
• (larger than neuron, smaller than brain)?

Assemblies (or ensembles) of neurons
• [Sherrington 1906, Hebb 1949, Harris 2003, 2005; 
Buzsaki 2008, 2010, Yuste et al. 2019,…]
• Assembly:  A large and densely intraconnected set of 
excitatory neurons in a brain area whose firing (in a 
pattern) is tantamount to our thinking of a particular 
memory, concept, person, name, word, episode, etc.
• G. Buzsaki 2020 The Brain Inside Out: 
“assemblies are the alphabet of the brain”

The assembly hypothesis
•There is an intermediate level of brain computation
•Call it the Assembly Calculus
•It is implicated in higher cognitive functions such as 
reasoning, planning, language, story-telling, math, 
music, …
•Assemblies of neurons are its basic representation
– its “data type”

The assembly hypothesis (cont.)
What are the operations of the Assembly Calculus?
•Projection
•Association
•Pattern completion
•Merge
•Bind (or reciprocal projection)
•...plus a couple of control commands

Q: but wait      
a minute!        
Is this 
a random 
bipartite
graph?

YES!  ”Random convergence of olfactory input in the Drosophila 
mushroom body” by S. Caron, V. Ruta, L. Abbott, R. Axel,2013 
Bottom line:
looks like a 
random 
bipartite graph, 
except that the 
degree 
distribution
of the LHS is 
not uniform

RP&C: overlap preservation
• A set A of k out of n nodes of the LHS fire
• A new set cap(A) is formed by RP&C
• Repeat now for B, cap(B)
• If A and B overlap in 𝛂k nodes, what is the 
overlap of cap(A) and cap(B)?
• Fruitfly algorithm does well empirically for near-neighbor search!
[A neural algorithm for a fundamental computing problem, Dasgupta-
Stevens-Navlakha, Science, Nov 2017]

RP&C: some math
Theorem [2018]:  The intersection of cap(A) and cap(B)
will be, with high probability, at least
𝑘
𝑛
1−𝛼
1+𝛼
ln ൗ
𝑛𝑘
𝛼
1+𝛼
Conjecture: 
no denominator

The underlying mathematical reason
Proof idea. Probability of being in a cap is positively correlated with 
being in a previous cap, if stimuli overlap.

𝑥+ 𝑦≥𝑡) ≫𝑘

So much for the fruit fly…
Q: Does something homologous
happen in mammals?
A:  Yes, except that now there is 
recurrent connectivity in the 
target area, as well as plasticity…

Also, Hebbian

Assembly

Theorem (PV 2016-18): The projection process converges 
exponentially fast, with high probability, and the total 
number of cells involved is at most:
• If β ≥ β*:  k + o(k)
• If 0< β < β*:  k⋅exp(0.17⋅ln(n/k)/ β)
• 𝛽∗=
2 −1
1 + 𝑝𝑘
ln 𝑛

k = 100

Proof of Convergence
• First cap 𝐴1: k neurons receiving highest input from stimulus, i.e., top k of n 
draws from 𝑁𝑝𝑘, 𝑝𝑘
• Second cap: k neurons receiving highest input from stimulus+𝐴1, i.e., top k of 
n draws from 𝑁(2𝑝𝑘, 2𝑝(1 −𝑝)𝑘)
• Competition between k previous winners and much larger pool. 
• Let 𝜇1, … , 𝜇𝑡be the fraction of new winners at each step
𝐶1 = 𝑝𝑘+
2𝑝𝑘ln 𝑛
𝑘,
𝐶𝑡= 2𝑝𝑘+ 2 𝑝𝑘ln 𝑛
𝜇𝑡𝑘,
𝑡≥2.

Proof of Convergence
𝐶1 = 𝑝𝑘+
2𝑝𝑘ln 𝑛
𝑘,
𝐶𝑡= 2𝑝𝑘+ 2 𝑝𝑘ln 𝑛
𝜇𝑡𝑘,
𝑡≥2.
•
For step 2, for a neuron to stay in the cap, we need:
1 + 𝛽𝐶1 + 𝑋≥𝐶2
with
𝑋∼𝑁𝑝𝑘, 𝑝(1 −𝑝)𝑘
where the (1 + 𝛽) is the plasticity boost for previous round winners
• This determines the threshold 𝛽∗
• Winners are more and more likely to survive:     1 + 𝛽𝑖𝐶𝑖+ 𝑋≥𝐶𝑖+1

Pattern Completion
• Recall: Future presentation of the same or *similar* stimulus fires mostly 
the same assembly.
• What about firing a subset of the assembly itself?
• Yes! Suffices to fire fraction of created stimuli to complete to (almost) the 
rest.
• Theorem [Collins-Mitropolsky-P.-V. 2019]. For any 𝜀∈(0,1), with 𝑇> 𝑇(𝜀)
presentations of a stimulus, the resulting assembly 𝐴has the property that 
firing 𝜀fraction of the assembly results in completing to 90% of A.
• Benefit of recurrent connections!

Association
• Provably happens with the 𝐺𝑛,𝑝assumption
• Similar to the proof of convergence

Merge of assemblies: it’s complicated…
…and useful for Language (Berwick-Chomsky)

Assembly Calculus recap
• project(y, B, x) 
•associate(x, y) 
• pattern_complete(x, y) 
•merge(x, y, B, z)
• Plus control commands:  
activate(x), read(), 
disinhibit(A)
Q: How powerful is this 
system? 
Thm: It can perform arbitrary 
𝒏-space computations
(under assumptions)

Merge:  How does language happen?
Broca’s area
Wernicke’s area

But why study language? 
•A last-minute adaptation
•It evolved to exploit the brain’s strengths
•Invaluable lens for studying the brain
•A deluge of recent experiments!

Languag: Uniquely Human
• Can generate infinitely many new sentences from relatively few examples: 
“Paucity of examples”
• Can we really generate infinite, “distinct” sentences?
• Argument 1: natural numbers are infinite
• I have one chocolate
• I have two chocolates
• I have three chocolates…
• Argument 2:
• I had a good time
• I had had a good time
• I had had had a good time…
• And, “I think you are funny”, “He thinks I think he is funny”, “I think he thinks I think 
he is funny”, …
• Other species generally only repeat simple patterns that they have 
encountered explicitly (ex. songbirds)

Nativist vs Empiricist
• Nativist theory argues that humans are born with universal grammar, and an ability to 
develop language skills is innate. In recent years, this theory has condensed to the 
minimalist program, which requires an operation called “MERGE” and postulates it to be 
the jump to language (Berwick and Chomsky).
• Empiricist theory argues that children receive enough linguistic inputs to develop 
language skills, and there is no need to assume such an innate universal grammar.
• From an evolutionary perspective, learning language skills do not seem as incremental as 
learning to walk. For walking, we exhibit an incremental learning curve, but for 
languages, we seem to go straight from knowing few words to generating infinite 
sentences!
• Why is there such a huge “gap”? Are there any evolutionary advantages to superior 
language acquisition abilities?
• Studies suggests that language skills help with cognitive abilities:
• Babies sitting in an asymmetrically shaped room or colored room were asked to find an object in 
one side of a room. Pre-verbal babies cannot find objects as well as babies who have learned how 
to speak.
• Language facilitates internal thought and advance planning.

in about a dozen spikes per step?
(Why a dozen?
neuron spikes ~ 50Hz :  
language ~ 4Hz)

“The truck hit the ball’’
Different areas of the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG)  
responded to “truck” in the two sentences

path to thinking about computation in the brain
•Conjectured architecture for syntax in language
• Are assemblies the seat of Axel’s “logic”?
• How can one test/verify/falsify the assembly hypothesis?

Coming up…
• Language games!
• And learning grammars
