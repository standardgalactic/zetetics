 The present status of the decaying neutrino theory

 The present status of the decaying neutrino theory is reviewed. Th
 developments are highlighted: (a) the proposal that the dark matter in ric
 of galaxies is mainly baryonic; (b) the implications of the hypothesis 
 photons are the solution of the C?/CO ratio problem; (c) the strong
 evidence from recent observations with the Hubble space telescope.
 1. The decaying neutrino theory
 If neutrinos have non-zero rest mass one would expect a more massive ne
 v1 to decay into a photon and a less massive neutrino type v2:
 V1 -- + V2.
 Conservation of energy and momentum in the decay tells us that the energy E, of the
 photon in the rest frame of v1 is given by
 E,= l=ml(-m2/ml).
 It is very likely that m2/m2 <E 1. In that case we would have the result
 E, = \m.
 Cowsik (1977) pointed out that even if the lifetime for this decay is much longer
 than the age of the universe, the photon flux from the cosmological distribution of
 neutrinos pair created in the hot Big Bang might be appreciable, simply because of
 the great length of the line of sight through the universe. This point has led to a
 considerable literature which I will not go into here. As I write this article I am
 completing a book which gives a detailed discussion of this question and is entitled
 Modern cosmology and the dark matter problem.
 The point of departure for this article was my suggestion (Sciama 1990a) that
 decay photons from dark matter neutrinos in our galaxy might be responsible for the
 otherwise puzzling widespread ionization of hydrogen in the interstellar medium.
 The key point here is that the ionization potential of hydrogen is 13.6 eV, so we
 require E > 13.6 eV and therefore ml > 27.2 eV. This gives us the first of the many
 coincidences in this subject because (a) the Tremaine-Gunn phase space constraint
 for neutrinos to be bound in the galaxy leads to essentially the same lower limit (b)
 the cosmological density pvl of vI neutrinos is such that
 m1 = 93vl h2eV,
 where as usual Qv = Pvl/Pcrit and h is the Hubble parameter given by
 H0 = lOOh km-1 s-1 Mpc-1 (2 < h < 1).

 If Qv1 1 and h 2 1 (which would be compatible with the observed age of the
 universe) we would have m, ? 23 eV. Thus if h is only slightly greater than 2 we
 would again have m, > 27.2 eV, and the decay photon would be able to ionize
 hydrogen.
 Encouraged by these coincidences I evaluated the decay lifetime z needed to
 account for the observed electron density in the interstellar medium (ne / 0.03 cm-3)
 and obtained T ? 2 x 1023 s.
 This choice of lifetime leads to another coincidence. Let us evaluate the
 intergalactic ionizing flux F of decay photons from the cosmological di
 neutrinos of density nv1. A naive estimate would be
 F - (nv/) (c/Ho).
 With nvl 100 cm-3, T 2 x 1023 s and c/Ho 2 x 1028 cm we would 
 F w 107 photons cm-2 s-1.
 At first sight this result is a disaster because there is an observational upper limit on
 F, namely
 F < 106 cm-2 s-1
 We can try to solve this problem by using the fact that the decay photons will be red
 shifted as they propagate, and once their energy is reduced below 13.6 eV they will
 no longer contribute to the ionizing flux. This effect is simple to include. If one writes
 E, = (13.6+e) eV,
 one has F - c13.6
 z HW03.6
 We can therefore solve our problem if
 14.1 + 0.5 eV, and ml = 28.2 + 1 eV. This giv
 of m1 leads to 2Qv 1 for a low value of h. A
 for the otherwise puzzling ionization of
 clouds.
 We can do even better than this if we use recent observational data to argue that
 the decay photons must also be able to ionize nitrogen (Sciama 1992). This requires
 that E. > 14.53 eV. Remarkably, this is just compatible with our upper limit and
 would lead to E, = 14.565 + 0.035 eV, and m1 = 29.13 + 0.07 eV. Thus the mass of the
 decaying neutrino (?v,) would be pinned down to better than 1 %. Also if we assume
 that Q2 = 1 when the baryon density is included then we obtain (Sciama 1990b)
 H0 = 56 + 0.5 km s-1 Mpc-1
 so that the Hubble constant would be pinned down to 1%.
 With this background we are now ready to consider three recent developments in
 these ideas.
 2. The nature of the dark matter in clusters of galaxies
 This decaying neutrino theory is widely regarded as having been disproved by th
 failure of Davidsen et al. (1991) to observe a decay line from dark matter neutrinos
 in the rich cluster of galaxies A665. However, since then Hughes & Tanaka (199
 have published detailed observations of the X-ray emission from the hot gas in thi

 cluster and have derived model distributions for the density of the galaxies, the gas
 and the dark matter. From this, one can show (Sciama et al. 1992, 1993) that the dark
 matter is more concentrated to the centre of the cluster than are either the galaxies
 or the gas. A similar concentration is found in other clusters both from the X-ray
 data and the gravitational lens data. I find it rather pleasing that general relativity
 can be used to help demonstrate this excess concentration of the dark matter.
 It seems unlikely that neutrinos would be more concentrated than baryons in
 clusters, since the neutrinos are non-dissipative. It is more likely that most of the
 dark matter in this case is baryonic. One possibility is that a cooling flow in the hot
 gas ends up as faint low mass stars (Thomas & Fabian 1990). The absence of an
 observable decay line would then be explained.
 By contrast the dark matter in our galaxy has a more extended distribution than
 the visible matter. This would fit in well with the hypothesis that this dark matter
 is in the form of neutrinos, but does not demand it. In any case I believe that these
 considerations make clear that the decaying neutrino theory is still viable.
 3. Ultraviolet radiation in dense molecular clouds
 It has been known for a long time that the abundance ratio of atomic 
 carbon monoxide in the interiors of dense molecular clouds in the galaxy is 
 105 times greater than would be expected from simple equilibrium mode
 referred to as the C?/CO ratio problem. In these models the flux of u
 radiation in the interiors of the clouds is very low because of their great opa
 so the dissociation rate of CO is also very low. One class of proposed solution
 problem involves mechanisms for increasing the ultraviolet flux in the 
 These proposals have recently been reviewed by Sorrell (1992). They in
 complicated mechanisms which are difficult to assess.
 By contrast, decaying neutrinos situated in the clouds would provide a
 straightforward mechanism, as was pointed out by Tarafdar (1991). This proposal
 has recently been updated by Sciama (1993a). A crucial role in Tarafdar's analysis
 is played by the opacity of the clouds to the decay photons, since this controls the
 resulting flux of these photons. The clouds typically have particle densities in the
 range 103-105 cm-3, and the vast majority of these particles is in the form of H2
 molecules. The flux of decay photons would only be sufficient to solve the C?/CO ratio
 problem if these photons are unable to dissociate the H2 molecules, so that the
 opacity of the clouds would be relatively small. Here enters a new coincidence. The
 photodissociation continuum of H2 has a threshold of 14.68 eV. Hence we require
 that E, < 14.68 eV. This constraint is essentially the same as our previous one, which
 followed from considering the intergalactic ionizing flux (E < 14.6 eV). The new
 constraint is more stringent in the sense that the threshold involved has been
 accurately measured, whereas the previous constraint involved more uncertain
 quantities (the decay lifetime and the observational limit on the intergalactic flux).
 If our nitrogen and C?/CO assumptions are both correct we would then have the
 essentially exact constraints 14.53 < E, < 14.68 eV, and (if m2 i m1) 29.06 < m1 <
 29.36 eV. The consequences for the value of the Hubble constant would then be
 essentially the same as before.

 4. Recent HST observations of the electron density in the interstella
 medium
 Strong support for the neutrino decay theory can be derived (Sciama 1993b) from
 the analysis by Spitzer & Fitzpatrick (1993) of their observations of a galactic ha
 star HD93521 using the Hubble space telescope. They observed the ultraviolet
 absorption spectrum of several regions along the line of sight to this star. One of the
 absorbing species was singly ionized carbon in an excited state, CII*. The excitation
 is probably due to electron collisions and so leads to the value of the electron densit
 ne in each absorbing region.
 In their analysis Spitzer & Fitzpatrick also used the 21 cm emission observation
 of Danley et al. (1992) which showed that the atomic hydrogen column density mak
 each region opaque to Lyman continuum photons. They concluded that the ioniz
 and neutral gas are intimately mixed up together, in contrast to the standard view
 that these two components of the interstellar medium are located in separate region
 (the warm ionized medium (WIM) and the warm neutral medium or (WNM)).
 If this is correct we face the same type of problem as we did in the previous sectio
 with the molecular clouds. In this case we are dealing with an excess of hydroge
 ionizing photons in an opaque region rather than an excess of CO dissociating
 photons. Again decaying neutrinos come to the rescue. In fact it was related opacity
 problems which led to the decaying neutrino theory in the first place, but we have
 here the first clear observational evidence that the free electrons (which were
 previously known to exist from Ho and pulsar dispersion data) are located in opaque
 regions.
 Further support for the theory comes from the values of ne derived by Spitzer &
 Fitzpatrick. They found for the slowly moving absorbing regions (which would be
 unaffected by shock waves) that ne is the same in each region to their observing
 precision of 10%. This is just what would be expected for opaque regions in the
 decaying neutrino theory, and it was predicted in the original paper (Sciama 1990a).
 The reason is simple. Since every decay photon produces an ionization locally, to be
 followed by a recombination, one has the ionization equilibrium equation
 n,/T= ane,
 where a is the appropriate recombination coefficient. In limited regions of the galaxy
 nv will be nearly constant, and ne will depend on the gas temperature T (via oc(T)) only
 as T'37. Moreover in warm regions, such as those observed by Spitzer & Fitzpatrick,
 the temperature is fairly constant. Hence ne should be nearly constant, as is
 observed.
 Moreover, if one assumes that carbon is undepleted in these regions (for whic
 there is some evidence (Sciama 1993b)), one finds for the four slowly moving region
 n = 0.055 cm-3. This is just the same as the values found for three other regio
 from an analysis of the pulsar dispersion measures of three pulsars with accurately
 known (parallactic) distances (Reynolds 1990; Sciama 1990c). One would not expec
 such constancy for other ionization mechanisms. Future HST measurements should
 provide a stringent test of these ideas.

 5. Conclusions
 I conclude from this discussion that the evidence in favour of the 
 neutrino theory is rather strong. One should therefore take seriousl
 implications. These include the early reionization of the universe and the r
 suppression of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background on sm
 scales (Scott et al. 1991), and attempts to derive the required decay life
 elementary particle physics (Roulet & Tommasini 1991; Gabbiani et al.

 Discussion
 A. W. WOLFENDALE (University of Durham, U.K.). Is it not possible that cosmic
 contribute significantly to the ionization of the ISM, particularly away fro
 galactic plane ? Even in the plane they are invoked to explain the modest he
 that occurs in the depth of dense molecular clouds.
 The cosmic ray injection rate is ca. 1040 erg s-l for the Galaxy and about 10 %
 this is lost within the Galaxy. The ionization produced would amount to about 0
 ion pairs per cm3, where f is the fraction of the ionization deposited over a per
 1010 years, which 'remains' at any one time.
 In fact Chi and I have claimed that there is a strong flux of sub-MeV electron
 the Galaxy; these, too, will produce considerable ionization.
 D. W. SCIAMA. It was shown many years ago, from the observed ionization 
 interstellar clouds, that cosmic rays are an important ionizing agency.
