Properties, Collections, and the Successive Addition

Argument: A Reply to Malpass

Abstract 
4 
The Successive Addition Argument (SAA) is one of the key arguments espoused by William 
5 
Lane Craig for the thesis that the universe began to exist. Recently, Alex Malpass (2021) 
6 
has developed a challenge to the SAA by way of constructing a counterexample that 
7 
originates in the work of Fred Dretske. In this paper, I show that the Malpass-Dretske 
8 
counterexample is in fact no counterexample to the argument. Utilizing a distinction 
9 
between properties of members and properties of collections, I argue that Malpass’ 
10 
counterexample has no bearing on the soundness of the SAA. I also develop a novel parity 
11 
argument against Malpass’ argument that I demonstrate can only be resolved by way of the 
12 
aforementioned analysis.

1. Introduction  
18 
 
19 
The Kalām cosmological argument, as championed by William Lane Craig 
20 
(1979), is an argument largely concerned with demonstrating that the temporal 
21 
series of events cannot regress infinitely. One argument Craig offers in support of 
22 
this thesis, as titled by Alex Malpass (2021), is the ‘Successive Addition Argument’, 
23 
or the SAA. The SAA is stated by Craig (1979, p. 103) as follows:  
24 
 
25 
(1) The temporal series of events is a collection formed by successive addition;  
26 
(2) A collection formed by successive addition cannot be an actual infinite; 
27 
(3) Therefore, the temporal series of events cannot be an actual infinite.  
28 
 
29 
Malpass (2021) has recently produced a novel challenge to the SAA, based on the 
30 
work of Dretske (1965). Malpass argues that there exists a clear counterexample to 
31 
(2), and thus the argument is not sound. After investigating six potential objections 
32 
Craig might offer, and finding them all wanting, Malpass concludes that his 
33 
argument constitutes a genuine counterexample to (2), and thus that the SAA is 
34 
unsound. 
35 
In this paper, I respond to Malpass on behalf of the SAA, arguing his 
36 
counterexample does not render the argument unsound. My contention is that 
37 
Malpass’ argument is either invalid in virtue of a shift in scope, or else irrelevant to 
38 
the truth of (2) in virtue of making a claim about the properties of members 
39 
successively added, rather than the properties of collections formed by successive 
40 
addition.     
41 
I will proceed as follows. In §2, I explicate Malpass’ argument from his 
42 
counterexample. In §3, I argue that Malpass’ counterexample is either of an invalid 
43 
form or else irrelevant to the truth of (2). In §4, I further this claim by developing a 
44 
parity argument that can only be satisfactorily resolved by accepting the disjunction 
45 
in §3. I conclude in §5.  
46

2. Malpass’ argument 
48 
 
49 
Malpass begins building his counterexample to (2) by asking us to imagine a 
50 
man named George who starts to count numbers at some time t.1 George counts at a 
51 
constant rate of one number per second, and never stops. Thus, each finite number 
52 
n is such that George will count n. So, the cardinality of the numbers that George 
53 
will count is just the cardinality of the natural numbers, ℵ0. From this setup, 
54 
Malpass (2021, p. 3) constructs the following argument: 
55 
  
56 
(4) It is possible that George starts counting now and will never stop;  
57 
(5) If George starts counting now and will never stop, then for each natural 
58 
number n, George will count n;  
59 
(6) If George will count each natural number, then George will count ℵ0-many 
60 
numbers; 
61 
(7) Therefore, it is possible that George will count ℵ0-many numbers.  
62 
 
63 
However, (7) appears to be a clear counterexample to (2). Prima facie, if it is 
64 
possible that I will count x-many numbers, then it is also possible that I will form a 
65 
collection by successive addition with x-many members. Thus, the fact that it is 
66 
possible that George will count ℵ0-many numbers means that George can form an 
67 
actually infinite collection by successive addition. Yet, (2) is the claim that 
68 
collections formed by successive addition cannot be actually infinite. So, Malpass’ 
69 
argument seems to undermine (2).  
70 
 
71 
3. The scope shift fallacy  
72 
 
73 
Malpass’ argument has two critical premises. These are that: 
74 
  
75 
(5) If George starts counting now and will never stop, then for each natural 
76 
number n, George will count n;  
77 
(6) If George will count each natural number, then George will count ℵ0-many 
78 
numbers.  
79 
 
80 
Both of these will be important in our discussion, and thus it is important to be 
81 
clear on what they mean: especially the consequents. The consequent of (5) is fairly 
82 
simple to formalize. Let G(n) abbreviate ‘n is counted by George’. Then what 
83 
Malpass has in mind in the consequent of (5) is that each n is such that there is a 
84 
future time t at which n is counted by George. In terms of the tense operator ‘F’ for 
85 
‘it will at some future time t be the case that’, this can be stated as:  
86 
 
87 
(8) (∀n) F(G(n)) 
88 
 
89 
 
1 The setup for this counterexample originates in Dretske (1965). 

 3 
The antecedent of (6) is the same. But what about the consequent of (6)? Here 
90 
things are not so clear. It’s not immediately obvious what Malpass means by the 
91 
phrase ‘George will count ℵ0-many numbers’. On the one hand, if we take ‘it will be 
92 
that 𝜙’ to mean that ‘there is a future time t such that 𝜙’, the consequent of (6) can 
93 
be read as the claim that ‘there is a future time t at which George counts ℵ0-many 
94 
numbers’. More formally,  
95 
 
96 
(9) F (∀n)(G(n)) 
97 
 
98 
But this cannot be the correct analysis. For Malpass explicitly notes that there is 
99 
no time at which George counts ℵ0-many numbers, as his counting literally ‘takes up 
100 
all the time in the world’ (2021, p. 15). Furthermore, moving from (8) to (9) blatantly 
101 
commits a scope-shift fallacy, and Malpass notes that ‘if the Dretske argument 
102 
involved a shift like this it would be bad news’ (Malpass 2021, p. 7). Thus, (9) cannot 
103 
be what Malpass has in mind in the consequent of (6). 
104 
What, then, does (6) amount to? Another analysis of (6) shows itself if we 
105 
examine how the premise is defended. Malpass notes that (6) is an application of 
106 
the following broader rule of inference:  
107 
 
108 
(R) If each element in a set S has property P, and the cardinality of the 
109 
elements of S is X, then the cardinality of the elements that are P is also [at 
110 
least] X. (2021, p. 8) 
111 
 
112 
(R), in the context of (6), is applied as such: if each natural number in the set of 
113 
natural numbers instantiates the property ‘will be counted by George’ and the 
114 
cardinality of the set of natural numbers is ℵ0, then the cardinality of the natural 
115 
numbers that instantiate the property ‘will be counted by George’ is also at least ℵ0. 
116 
As Malpass says: ‘if each natural number will be counted, and there are ℵ0-many 
117 
natural numbers, then ℵ0-many natural numbers will be counted’ (2021, p. 15). 
118 
So, it appears that when Malpass affirms that the cardinality of the natural 
119 
numbers that will be counted by George is also ℵ0, Malpass is not falsely claiming 
120 
that there is some future time where George counts ℵ0-many natural numbers. 
121 
Rather, what is being said is that there exist ℵ0-many natural numbers each of 
122 
which instantiates the property ‘will be counted by George’. Otherwise, both (6) and 
123 
the broader rule (R) are clearly faulty. 
124 
Thus, let us suppose the proper reading of (6) is just that there are ℵ0-many 
125 
natural numbers instantiating this property. If this is what is meant by Malpass, 
126 
then his argument faces a serious problem. Namely, (6) is not telling us anything 
127 
importantly over and above what is said by (5), the premise that each number is 
128 
such that George will count it. Indeed, it seems all (6) tells us that is not already 
129 
contained in (5) is that there exist ℵ0-many such numbers.  
130 
But if all (6) does in the context of Malpass’ argument is alter the relevant 
131 
quantification––such that we are entitled to the further claim that there are ℵ0-
132 
many numbers instantiating the property ‘will be counted by George’––then we are 
133 
left wondering how the argument can be considered in any sense a counterexample 
134 

 4 
to (2). Recall that (2), the initial premise Malpass is attempting to challenge, is the 
135 
claim that no collection formed by successive addition can be actually infinite. What 
136 
(2) amounts to is not the claim that there cannot be an actually infinite number of 
137 
x’s such that each x instantiates the property ‘is successively added’. This claim is 
138 
demonstrably false. Any actually infinite number of elements is such that each 
139 
element instantiates the property ‘will be successively added’ (provided the 
140 
elements occur at future times). Instead, (2) must be understood as the stronger 
141 
claim that there cannot be a collection of an actually infinite number of x’s that 
142 
instantiates the property ‘is formed by successive addition’.  
143 
This should not come as a surprise––after all, Craig is talking about collections 
144 
and what properties we may ascribe to them throughout the SAA. (1) is the claim 
145 
that the temporal series of events is a collection that is formed by successive 
146 
addition. (2) is the claim that such collections cannot be actually infinite. His 
147 
conclusion is that the collection of the temporal series of events is not actually 
148 
infinite.  
149 
Thus, a counterexample to (2) cannot merely be one where ℵ0-many x’s each 
150 
instantiate the property ‘is successively added’––rather, it must be one where a 
151 
collection of ℵ0-many x’s is formed by successive addition. One might rightfully ask 
152 
at this point what it means to say of a collection that it is formed by successive 
153 
addition. To my mind, it is just our earlier (9): a collection of x’s is formed by 
154 
successive addition just in case there is a future time t at which, for all x’s in the 
155 
collection, x has been successively added. Craig is claiming that a certain collection, 
156 
namely, the temporal series of events, cannot have a certain property, namely, being 
157 
formed by successive addition, whilst having a cardinality of ℵ0. What Malpass’ 
158 
argument shows (if it is not interpreted to be invalid) is that it is indeed possible for 
159 
ℵ0-many x’s to instantiate this property. That, though, is perfectly compatible with 
160 
the SAA.  
161 
To defeat the claim that a collection that is formed by successive addition cannot 
162 
be actually infinite it does not suffice to give an example of ℵ0-many x’s that each 
163 
are successively added. One must give an example of a collection of ℵ0-many 
164 
members which is formed by successive addition. That George will count ℵ0-many 
165 
numbers, in the sense that ℵ0-many numbers instantiate the property ‘will be 
166 
counted by George’, entails that it is possible that there are ℵ0-many elements that 
167 
instantiate the property ‘will be successively added’. But that is all it entails. It 
168 
certainly does not entail that a collection with ℵ0-many members instantiates the 
169 
property ‘will be formed by successive addition’. Put simply, if Craig is arguing that 
170 
collections cannot exemplify certain properties, a proper counterexample must be 
171 
one where a collection exemplifies those properties. No premise in (4)–(7) entails 
172 
that any collection has any such property.  
173 
Thus, the problem for Malpass’ argument is disjunctive: either it is invalid in 
174 
virtue of moving from a claim about the properties of members to a claim about the 
175 
properties of collections, or else falls short of the mark of a proper counterexample 
176 
to (2) because it is concerned only with a claim about the properties of members.  
177 
 
178

4. A parity 
179 
 
180 
Malpass’ argument relies crucially on the claim that (7) is a counterexample to 
181 
the premise that a collection formed by successive addition cannot be an actual 
182 
infinite. To put more forcefully the idea that Malpass’ counterexample is not 
183 
relevant to the truth of (2), consider how one would argue against the more 
184 
evidently false claim that it is possible that the numbers George will have counted 
185 
are actually infinite. Indeed, Malpass agrees that ‘it is false that George will have 
186 
counted infinitely many numbers’ and makes it explicit that ‘George will not have 
187 
counted every number’ (2021, pp. 12, 14). So, the following is a claim Malpass must 
188 
accept: 
189 
  
190 
(C) The numbers that George will have counted cannot be an actual infinite. 
191 
 
192 
But now imagine that someone attempts to challenge (C) by way of the following 
193 
familiar line of argumentation:  
194 
 
195 
(4*) It is possible that George starts counting now and will never stop; 
196 
(5*) If George starts counting now and will never stop, then for each natural  
197 
  number n, George will have counted n; 
198 
(6*) If George will have counted each natural number, then George will have  
199 
  counted ℵ0-many numbers; 
200 
(7*) Therefore, it is possible that George will have counted ℵ0-many numbers. 
201 
 
202 
(4*)–(7*), despite paralleling (4)–(7), form an unpalatable argument for Malpass, 
203 
as (7*) is agreed to be blatantly false. And it also seems as though the guilty 
204 
premise in this argument is (6*)––it does not follow from the mere fact that each 
205 
number will have been counted by George that George will have counted ℵ0-many 
206 
numbers. But if this is correct, then (6*) and (6) employ the same faulty form of 
207 
inference, and so Malpass’ own argument is unsound.   
208 
However, like Malpass, the defender of (6*) can claim that the phrase ‘George 
209 
will have counted ℵ0-many numbers’ simply means that ℵ0-many numbers 
210 
instantiate the property of ‘will have been counted by George’.  
211 
The obvious response here is that if (6*) is to be understood as such, (7*) will not 
212 
constitute a relevant counterexample to (C): that each natural number instantiates 
213 
the property ‘will have been counted by George’, such that there are ℵ0-many 
214 
numbers with this property, does not undermine the fact that the numbers that 
215 
George will have counted cannot be actually infinite. Again, this is because what is 
216 
meant by ‘the numbers that George will have counted cannot be actually infinite’ is 
217 
that there is no time where the collection of numbers George has formed by his 
218 
counting is actually infinite. Pointing out that each natural number is such that it 
219 
will have been counted is irrelevant. 
220 
It might be objected here that I have treated the sentences ‘George will count ℵ0-
221 
many numbers’ and ‘George will have counted ℵ0-many numbers’ as broadly 
222 

 6 
symmetrical: under either interpretation they will both be false or both be true. 
223 
However, perhaps this is problematic, since Malpass understands these phrases to 
224 
be asymmetric:  
225 
 
226 
The reason George will count every number, but George will not have counted 
227 
every number, isn’t just that there are infinitely many numbers; it is because 
228 
there is no point in time which follows his counting. (Malpass 2021, pp. 14-15, 
229 
emphasis in original) 
230 
 
231 
Dretske concurs:  
232 
 
233 
It is true that at any stage of his task George will not yet have counted some 
234 
numbers. But, clearly this fact is not relevant to whether he will count to 
235 
infinity; it only shows that he never will have counted to infinity. (Dretske 
236 
1965, p. 100, emphasis in original) 
237 
 
238 
But in the context of (4)–(7) and (4*)–(7*), whence the difference between the 
239 
fact that George will count every number and the fact that George will have counted 
240 
every number? If Malpass thinks that the latter is false because there is no time 
241 
following George’s counting, it can equally be said that the former is false because 
242 
there is no time terminating George’s counting, and so it is not the case that George 
243 
will count every number. Unless, of course, what Malpass has in mind is that there 
244 
need be no time terminating George’s counting: it suffices that there are infinitely 
245 
many numbers, each of which instantiates the property ‘will be counted by George’. 
246 
Yet, again, by the same token it can be said that there need be no time following 
247 
George’s counting: it suffices that there are infinitely many numbers, each of which 
248 
instantiates the property ‘will have been counted by George’. The point here is that 
249 
Malpass is faced with two possible options with respect to (6) and (6*): either they 
250 
make the fallaciously-motivated claim that there is a time at which George counts 
251 
(or will have counted) ℵ0-many numbers, or they are simply claiming that there are 
252 
ℵ0-many numbers that each instantiate the property ‘will be counted by George’ or 
253 
‘will have been counted by George’.  
254 
The salient point here is that Malpass cannot consistently hold that it is not 
255 
possible that George will have counted ℵ0-many numbers and that (4)–(7) 
256 
successfully defeat the SAA. I have proposed a disjunctive remedy: either both (6*) 
257 
and (6) are false, or both (7*) and (7) are not relevant counterexamples.  
258 
 
259 
5. Conclusion   
260 
 
261 
In total, then, the SAA is not defeated by Malpass’ argument. As  
262 
outlined herein, the crucial third premise of the argument––that if George will 
263 
count every number then he will count ℵ0-many numbers––can either be read such 
264 
that it is a fallacious rule of inference, or otherwise facilitates a conclusion that is 
265 
no way a counterexample to (2). By my lights, this provides ample reason for 
266 
defenders of the SAA to reject Malpass’ counterexample to (2).
