7o the Holders of Six Per Cent. Gold Conrokdatea 
Sink of the County of New York, Payable July 
I, 1901 
THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM 
the proceedings of the Commissioners of the 
Sinking Fund at a meeting held Tuesday, February 
'9, IgOI • 
The Comptroller presented the following report and 
accompanying resolution relative to the redemption of 
six percent. (.'old Consolidated Stock ofthe County of 
New York, maturing July I, Ig_ r : 
CITY OF NEW YORK, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE 
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE, February 15, Igor. 
To the Commissioners of the Striking Fund: 
GENTLEMEN—SIX per cent. Gold Consolidated Stock, 
amounting to eight million eight hundred and eighty-
five thousand five hundred dollars (58,885,5oo), which 
was issued by the County of New York prior to its 
consolidation with the former City of New York, 
matures on July I, 19o1. 
The said stock is all held by the public and is pay-
able from the Sinking Fund for the Redemption of the 
City Debt (No. I), under the provisions of section 213 
of chapter 378 of the Laws of 1897. 
Under an amendment to the Constitution of the State 
of New York adopted at the general election held in 
the year r899, the said stock is exempted, for the debt-
restrictive purposes of section so of article VIII. of the 
Constitution, from classification as a City debt. 
In view of the present heavy demands upon the City's 
debt-incurring capacity, especially for rapid transit 
and bridge construction, it is desirable to retain the 
advantage gained by such exemption. This advantage 
wouro Be practically lost as to the amount of said 
stock if it were to be redeemed out of the Sinking 
Fund, or if it were refunded by the issue of Corporate 
Stock of The City of New York. 
I therefore propose to extend the maturity of a con-
siderable proportion, if not the whole of such stock, for 
periods not exceeding twenty years, under the authority 
conferred upon me by chapter 63o of the Laws of igoo, 
upon the best obtainableterms for the-City. 
It is not unlikely, however, that it may prove Impos-
sible to extend certain portions of said stock upon 
advantageous terms, and I therefore recommend that 
a resolution be adopted authorizing the Comptroller to 
redeem from the Sinking Fund such portions of said 
stock. 
Respectfully,

tgol, and is payable from the Sinking Fund for the 
Redemption of the City Debt (No. I), under the pro- 
visions of section 213 of chapter 378 of the Laws

Whereas, the Comptroller proposes, under the 
authority of chapter 6ao of the Laws of xgoo, to extend 
for periods not exceeding twenty years the maturity of 
as much of said stock as he may be able to so extend 
upon terms advantageous to the City : therefore 
Resolved, That the Comptroller be and is hereby 
authorized to pay out of the Sinking Fund for the Re-
demption of the City Debt (No. t), such portion of the 
six per cent, Gold Consolidated Stock of the County of 
New York, payable July I, igot, as he may be unable 
to extend upon terms deemed by him to be advanta-
geous to the City. 
The report was accepted and the resolution unani. 
mously adopted. 
For the reasons set forth in the foregoing report 
to the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, the Comp. 
troller of The City of New York will avail himself 
of the provisions of chapter 630 of the Laws of igoo, 
which reads as follows:

indebtedness of the counties of New York, Kings, 
Queens and Richmond. 
ACCEPTED BY THE CITY.

the Governor. Passed, a majority being present. 
The People of the State of New York, represented in 
Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows: 
Section I. It shall be lawful for the comptroller of 
the city of New York, in his discretion, to provide for 
the extension of all or any part of the funded indebted-
ness of the counties of New York, Kings, Queens and 
Richmond, as the same may from time to time mature. 
Certificates of stock or bonds so extended shall bear 
interest at a rate not exceeding three and one-half per 
centum per annum, and shall be stamped across their 
face with the terms of such extension, which shall be 
for a period not exceeding twenty years. 
Sec. z. This act shall take effect immediately. 
Proposals will be received by the Comptroller at his 
office, No. z8.. Broadway, New York Ctty, from the 
holders of six per cent Gold Consolidated Stoc

bear interest from July I, igoo, at the rate of three and 
three-tenths (u,) per cem, per annum, payable, also in 
gold, semi-annually on the fir-t day of January and of 
July in each year. The Comptroller proposes to appor-
tion the amount of stock thus extended so that, as 
nearly as practicable, one-fifth of the whole amount ex-
tended shall be redeemable at each of the five maturity 
dates above mentioned. Preference will, as far as 
possible, be given to the proposals received accord-
ing to priority in the date ofPtheir receipt, the pro-
posats nrst received being entitled to the privilege of 
the longest extension period, unless such proposal shall 
indicate a preference for the shorter terms. The stock 
which is to be extended in accordance with the terms 
of this circular must be delivered to the Comptroller 
upon demand, when the certificates will be stamped 
across their face with the terms of the extension, 
in accordance with the provisions of chapter 630 of the 
Laws of igoo, provided, however, that such stock now 
outstanding in coupon form when presented for 
extension will be extended in the form of registered 
stock. Thereafter transfers maybe made of such stock 
on the books of the Corporation in accordance with the 
general provisions of law and the rules of the Depart-
ment of Finance in regar4, thereto. The right to dis-
continue the offer contained in this circular at any 
time without further notice is expressly reserved.
