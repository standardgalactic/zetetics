P. 24. THE relevant passages of Nicolaus Smyrnaeus and Bede are
printed, with an interesting plate, by M. Froehner in an article
on certain Roman tesserae in Annuaire de la Soc. Numismatique,
Paris, 1884. Mr A. S. Murray gave me the article in pamphlet
form, newly paged.
P. 44. Prof. Robertson Smith informs me that gematria is certainly
from yecojaerpia, by a common Semitic transliteration.
P. 108 n. 3. In the, Journal of Philology, xm. No. 25. pp. 107—113,
Mr T. L. Heath, after proving by new evidence that the
algebraic s of Diophantus is not the final sigma, shows that
s° occurs in cursive MSS. as an abbreviation of dpifyios, used in its
ordinary sense, for which also dp. is sometimes found. 
Hence he
suggests that Diophantus' s is merely a contraction of dp. This
theory is pretty but I do not think it is true, for three reasons.
(1) The contraction must be supposed to be as old as the time
of Diophantus, for he describes the symbol as r& s instead of T&
or T(4 dp. Yet Diophantus can hardly (as Mr Heath admits)
have used cursive characters. 
(2) The abbreviation s5 for
dpiOfws in its ordinary sense is very rare indeed. It is not
found in the MSS. of Nicomachus or Pappus, where it might
most readily be expected. It may therefore be due only to a
scribe who had some reminiscence of Diophantus. 
(3).If s is
for dp., then, by analogy, the full symbol should be s' (like 8", K")
and not s°.

Prof. P. De Lagarde suggests that the x of modern algebra is
simply the regular Spanish representative of the Arabic letter,
which is the initial of shai, the Arabic name of the unknown
quantity. This may be (but I believe is not) true of Luca
Pacioli, Tartaglia and other early Italian algebraists. The
accounts which I have seen of their works are inconsistent and
inconclusive. 
But their more important successors had no
prepossession whatever in favour of x. Wallis (in his Algebra,

1685. p. 127.), says "Whereas it was usual with Harriot (as
before with Vieta and Oughtred) to put consonants B, G, D, &c,
for known quantities and vowels, A, E, I &c, for unknown,
Descartes chooseth to express his unknown quantities by the
latter letters of the alphabet (as z, y, x) and the known by the
former letters of it as a, b, c, &c." Thus Descartes probably
set the fashion, but he may have resumed an old tradition.
P. 129. There seems to be a reference to a Hebrew harpedonaptes
in Micah II. 5.
Pp. 182—185. Dr Allman, in Hermathena No. x., has another
paper on Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid. This deals
very elaborately with Archytas and Eudoxus.
Pp. 189 arid 238. A statement that the parallelogram of forces was
known to Aristotle was struck out of p. 189 as incorrect, but
by accident, no substitute was inserted. The omission is rectified
on p. 238.
P. 204. There is a very remarkable article by Dr Klamroth "iiber
den Arabischen Euclid" in Zeilschr. Deutsch. Morgenldnd. Ge-
sellsch. 1881, pp. 270—-326. This gives a most careful account
of the Arabic texts of Euclid. It would appear that Euclid's
Elements was the first Greek book translated into Arabic.
P. 208. In the American Journal of Math. u. pp. 46—48,
Mr G. B. Halsted has a ' Note on the First English Euclid' from
which it appears, among other things, that Billingsley became
Sir Henry Billingsley, and was Lord Mayor of London in
1591.
Pp. 263 and 277 n. I have wrongly followed Thevenot and Fabricius
in the note on p. 277. The Philon mentioned by Vitruvius was
an Athenian architect and is clearly not the engineer Philon, part
of whose work is in the Veteres MatJieniatici. The latter Philon
seems to be identical with Philon of Byzantium, who is
mentioned on p. 263. If so, then Philon of Byzantium had
certainly heard Otesibius lecture and must be assigned to a date
about 150 B.C.
Philon's construction should have been given on p. 263.
He describes a circle about the rectangle ABDG. A ruler,
cutting AB produced in F, AC produced in G, and the circle in
H, D, is turned about the point B until FH equals DG. The
line FHDG is called "Philo's line" in modern geometry, but its
author did not know its singular property.
