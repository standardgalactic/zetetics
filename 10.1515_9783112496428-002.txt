An Ising Model Analysis of Dielectric Polarization2) 
I. Analysis for the Dielectric Response of Infinite and Finite Dipolar Chains 
in Dielectrics 
By 
S. BOZDEMIR 
An analysis of the dielectric polarization for a model system consisting of a one-dimensional chain 
of dipoles with nearest neighbour interaction only is presented. In this model, each dipole is 
assumed to have two components: One is normally oriented between two localized states in a plane 
perpendicular to the chain axis, while the other is oriented along the chain. The model further 
presumes that the reorientation probability of any dipole located on the site chain has a time-de-
pendent parameter, depending at any instant upon the momentary orientation of neighbouring 
dipoles. Glauber's time-dependent Ising model formalism is applied to this situation. It is shown 
that the decay function of a single dipole located in either an infinite or a finite chain results in 
a non-Debye-type form, due to the many-body nature of the induced molecular moments. 
Eine Analyse der dielektrischen Polarisation für ein Modellsystem aus einer eindimensionalen 
Kette von Dipolen mit nur nächster Nachbarwechselwirkung wird vorgeschlagen. Das Modell 
setzt voraus, daß jeder Dipol zwei Komponenten besitzt. Die eine ist normalerweise zwischen 
zwei örtlichen Zuständen in einer Ebene senkrecht zur Kettenachse orientiert, während die andere 
entlang der Kette orientiert ist. Weiterhin nimmt das Modell an, daß die Reorientierungs-
wahrscheinlichkeit irgendeines Dipols an der Kette einen zeitabhängigen Parameter hat, was 
wieder zu einer beliebigen Zeit von der momentanen Orientierung der Nachbardipole abhängt. 
Glaubers zeitabhängiger Ising-Modell-Formalismus wird auf diese Situation angewandt. Es wird 
gezeigt, daß die Zerfallsfunktion eines einzigen Dipols in endlicher oder unendlicher Kette einen 
Nicht-Debye-Typ beschreibt, welcher durch die induzierten Molekularmomente der komplexen 
Natur der Kette verursacht wird. 
1. Introduction 
The dielectric response of a system having dipolar intractions may be characterized 
by either the complex permittivity, e(a>) = e'(co) — ie"(oj), in frequency represen-
tation; or by the time-delayed dipole correlation function q>{t), based on statistical 
mechanical consideration. Here e'(co) is the frequency-dependent real part of the 
permittivity and e"(co) the loss factor. <p(t) is simply the expectation value of a time-
delayed product of values of the dipole moments [1 to 7],

The terms <m}(0) wr(0)> express the orientation correlation between dipoles j and r 
in equilibrium. The average given in (1) is to be taken over a canonical distribution of 
initial states. It may be noted that equation (1) consists essentially of two parts:

refers to the reorientation of a reference dipole j in the system, while the latter 
term (j =j= r) represents the dynamic correlation between dipole r and the reference 
dipole j. 
The relation between <p(t) and s(co) is made complicated by local field factors, but 
Cook and his co-workers [8] showed that under certain conditions one can write

where q(co)

high-frequency permittivities, respectively. For cases of practical interest, as s(co) ~ 
«s es, q(a>) may be taken to be unity. 
The classical case of dielectric response known in the literature as Debye response 
[9, 10] is normally characterized by an exponential decay of polarization in time after 
the electric field has been switched off. However, it is important to note that an 
exponential decay function (and hence the Debye equations) can only be obtained 
from any model of dielectric relaxation, if the dipoles or charged particles are assumed 
to be non-interacting with each other. On the other hand, the experimental evidence 
does not conform to the Debye behaviour as a universal response. The vast majority 
of materials show non-Debye response characterized by both a non-exponential 
decay function [11 to 13] and a non-Debye type dispersion function [14 to 17], 
The important question which is the subject of this article, concerns the reasons 
for the departure of the dielectric polarization in many systems from the Debye 
response. Of course, one can always attribute non-Debye behaviour to a suitable 
distribution of relaxation times. But this approach involves a rather artifical procedure. 
So it was found inadequate in a number of papers [11 to 13, 18 to 20], and was partic-
ularly criticized by Jonscher [21]. Jonscher has, alternatively, suggested that non-
Debye behaviour could arise from many-body interactions between dipoles or charged 
particles. Starting with this suggestion, we propose a simple model of an interacting 
system consisting of a one-dimensional chain of dipoles with nearest-neighbour inter-
action only. Each dipole is oriented between two localized states in a plane perpen-
dicular to the chain axis, labelled as ( i 1). It is presumed that the reorientation prob-
ability of any dipole located along the chain is a time-dependent parameter, depending 
at any instant upon the momentary orientation of neighbouring dipoles. Glauber's 
time dependent Ising model analysis [22] is applied to this situation. It is shown that 
Jonscher's prediction essentially holds, and an Ising-type interaction is sufficient to 
give rise to the observed departure from the Debye response in a wide range of solids 
and liquids containing short-range chains such as liquid polymers, order-disorder 
ferroelectrics, and weak hydrogen bonding systems in solutions or crystalline form. 
We also realize that Glauber's treatment of the Ising model has already been applied 
to dielectrics by a number of workers [23 to 25] in a different context. The latest 
application of Glauber's results to dielectrics was made by Anderson [26] in order to 
explain the lower frequency loss peak observed by Stockmayer et al. [27] in a series 
of liquid PPO samples. 
Strictly speaking Anderson's work appears to be the most significant one from the 
point of view of the dielectric. First, he introduced a set of first-order differential 
equations consisting of some specific rate constants which enables one to describe the 
response of chain motion after removing the electric field. By solving these equations 
numerically, he was able to obtain a number of differently shaped types of loss be-
haviour which is similar to many observed types in nature departing significantly 
from a single relaxation time process. On the other hand, Anderson's approach may 
be found insufficient in the sense that he mainly employed a numerical method for

the solution of his rate equations for chain dynamics and also gave misinterpretation 
for some of the results obtained. 
In this study, Anderson's rate equation has been rederived in a different way by 
using only Glauber's formalism of the Ising model, and its solution has been presented 
analytically under certian conditions. Particularly, both the Laplace transform of 
the cross-correlation term of the time-delayed dipole-correlation function for an 
infinite dipolar chain and of the auto-correlation term of the time-delayed dipole-
correlation function for a finite dipolar chain can be derived in a simple analytical 
form. Their analysis, which can be done with a programmable pocket calculator, 
exhibits a number of physically important results as will be demonstrated in Part I I 
of this paper [28]. 
2. Glauber's Analysis: Derivation of the Time-Dependent Dipole Correlation 
Function 
Let a linear chain comprise N dipoles, being indexed serially along the chain. Each 
dipole is represented by a unit vectors s,(i), which is a stochastic function of time and 
making random transitions between values ¿ 1 , due to interactions with a phonon 
bath. The dipole moment of the ;-th dipole located on site j, may therefore be expressed 
in terms of 
by 
= m0s}. As M(t) = w0 ^ 
is the vector sum of m.j(t) per unit 
volume, (2) may be written as 
* 
pW =

(3) 
The knowledge of <p{t) and hence the auto-correlation and cross-correlation terms is 
essential in dielectric relaxation, but the complete derivation of the time-dependent 
form, starting from the Hamiltonian of the system, is an extremely difficult problem 
which is far from being solved in general. One possible derivation of the actual time-
dependent form of auto-correlation and cross-correlation terms will now be presented 
in terms of Glauber's formalism of the Ising model. 
To begin with, we define the state of the system at time t by the set of orientations, 
8(t) = {(i), 
s2(t), ... , Sj(t) ... sN(t)} 
and the initial state of the system, say, at time 
t = 0 is determined by £(0) = {^(0), s2(0), ... , 
0), ... , 
sN(0)}. 
A full description of the system is provided by the (occupation) probability function 
P[S(t); 
i] or in general conditional probability function 
t \ £(0)] which gives 
the probability of a specified set of orientations at time t, as determined by the precisely 
known initial orientations S(0). 
Let u>j(Sj) denote the probability per unit time that the /-th dipole executes a flip. 
Then the time derivative of the occupation probability function may be expressed 
by a Markovian master equation of the form 
P(S; 0 = — 2 «f 2 
s'jco^sj) P{slt 
... , s'j, ... sN\ t) , 
(4)

where the first term describes the destruction of the dipole configuration and the 
second term gives the reconstruction of the required configuration. Namely, when 
the 7-th element changes its value from s} to — t h r o u g h the transition, the original 
configuration of the system does no longer exist but, configurations such as (s^ s2, 
... , Sj, ... , sN) could equally well reconstruct the required configuration through the 
transition — «j -> s u subject to the condition that only one element can change sign 
during this transition.

The validity of the above master equation can be argued for a liquid. However, 
one can reasonably assume that (4) can be valid at high temperatures (relative to J/k) 
[29] for both liquids and solids on the following grounds. The configuration of the 
equilibrium positions of molecules in crystals is very stable, while in liquids it is 
substantially more variable, but even in the case of liquids or of diluted solutions the 
configuration can be considered as stable during the small time interval which is 
necessary for a dipolar transition. For these reasons the following considerations cover 
both liquids and solids. 
Now, let the occupation probability be normalized, so that the expectation values 
of any chosen unit vector, say, 
at time t regarded as stochastic function of time, 
is defined by 
<7î(0 = <«fM> = S 8i(t) P(s ; t) • 
(5) 
{S} 
Here {$} denotes a sum out over the 2N values of the set S = 
s2, s3, ... , 
... , sN}. 
The time derivative of gj can be easily obtained after both sides of the master 
equation have been multiplied by s? and summing over all possible configurations {S}, 
except sj where the summation does not vanish, also provided that diagonal terms 
sf = 1. One gets at once 
- for,) = - 2 <«,(«) ©,(«,)> • 
(6) 
The further analysis of this equation proceeds by choosing a sufficiently simple form 
for the transition rates cOj(Sj). In particular Glauber's choice in the case of nearest-
neighbour interaction was 
°>Asi) = J 
1 — 4 VSl(Si-1 + *J + l) 
(7) 
with y = tanh (2Jr/A;J1) < 1, where / is the rate per unit time at which the ;-th dipole 
makes a transition from one site to the opposite one while the applied field and J 
(the interaction strength between adjacent dipoles) are both equal to zero. In the 
dielectric case, / takes the following form: 
/ = 2v0 exp ( - WjkT) . 
(8) 
Here v0 is the frequency factor assumed to be in the range of phonon frequencies, W 
is the energy barrier between two localized sites, apart from the interaction energy of 
dipoles. 
The detailed derivation of (7) is simple by using the principle of detailed balance 
and the identity exp (SjA) = cosh A + S) sinh A, where the Hamiltonian is given by 
3€ = W - J S 
= W — Js^sj.!

After substituting (7) into (6), a recursive system of differential equations is obtained

Assuming an infinite number of units in the chain, the solution of (9) can be obtained 
analytically through the introduction of a generating function with the appropriate 
initial condition. If we consider first the case in which all the dipole expectations

The function g^t) describes the instantaneous value at time t 
0 of the polarization 
of an individual element, through the interaction with its nearest neighbours, after 
the removal of a polarizing field at t = 0. It must be realized at the outset that the 
moment w%(£) is in fact dependent upon the configurations of a large number of mole-
cules at time t due to the many-body nature of the induced molecular moments. An 
examination of the functions Ij shows that g0(t) which describes the dipoles located 
at the origin decreases exponentially to zero as time increases giving the pure Debye 
behaviour, while the neighbouring dipole expectations described by the function I;, 
j =f= 0 which is non-exponential, rise from zero to positive values for a while as a 
"polarization cloud" induced by the dipole at the origin. Equation (11) shows clearly 
how this superimposed polarization cloud modifies the decay function of a single 
dipole moment. 
It is interesting to note that this theoretical result, and the interpretation given 
above, is essentially consistent with Jonscher's propositions [21]. Here is in fact more 
evidence that the effective relaxation time for the dipole at the origin is 1 // while for 
the induced dipoles r r = 1 /fy. Note that always r, _> r because y <T 1, as suggested 
by Jonscher in his model. The function I j ( y f t ) essentially describes the decay of the 
polarization cloud which corresponds to the slow mechanism in Jonscher's model. 
However, the physically more important function is the time-delayed dipole cor-
relation function, defined by

where 
P [ S ( t ) | *S'(0); t] is the conditional probability function which describes the 
configuration { S ( t ) } at time t in a probabilistic sense when the system has^been in the 
configuration {*S'(0)} at time t = 0. The function <pij implies the fact that a Variation 
of any dipole at a given instant induces polarization among its neighbours, Which 
only becomes appreciable after a finite interval of time, i.e. not instantaneously. ' *

The summation over the configuration {S(t)} may be regarded simply as the expecta-
tion value of the j-th dipole at time t with respect to the initial configuration of the 
dipoles, {$(0)}. We may write g}(t) = 2 P[S(t) \ JS(0); t] Sj(t) whose actual time-
dependent form was already given by (11). Now the time-dependent form of the 
function <pij(t) can be obtained by inserting (11) into (13) and making use of the 
identity

It is now a matter of mathematical manipulation to obtain the corresponding 
expression for the complex permittivity from these time-dependent dipole correlation 
functions by substituting them into (2). This will be done in Part I I of this paper [28] 
which will also contain the comparison with experimental data. 
We shall now present the analysis of a short dipolar chain in terms of an Ising 
formalism. 
3. Analysis for a Finite Chain 
Up to now, we have been dealing with the derivation of the time-dependent dipole 
correlation function appropriate to an infinite chain having perpendicular dipoles 
with respect to the axis of the backbone chain. For this treatment we did not consider 
any effects arising from the existing parallel dipole components along the chain, i.e. 
the influence of chain length and chain mobility on dielectric response of the chain. 
The chain length being assumed to be infinite, the mobility of the end groups was 
negligible. However, when the chain length is short, say N = 4 to 50 dipoles, a 
spatial correlation between midchain elements and the end elements initially exists, 
as may be seen in Fig. 2. In such cases it is reasonable to expect that the rotation 
of the parallel dipole components at the ends should also be reflected in the relaxation 
behaviour of the chain. 
One would expect that the rotation of the perpendicular dipole components about 
the chain axis would, in general, be much more frequent than the rotation of the 
parallel components about the chain as axis, since this latter rotation requires the

regions normally exist in liquid polar polymers [27, 30, 31] and weak hydrogen bonding 
systems [18, 32] in non-polar solutions. 
To show how these two processes co-operate and can be analyzed, we write down 
two more rate equations to describe the dynamics of the end elements in addition to 
(9).

The equations given in (i) and (iii) have been derived using the assumption that 
the chain under study is an open chain with a finite length. In such a chain, the end 
elements can interact with only one adjacent neighbour and are likely to move with 
a different frequency, say /', from the element located in the interior of the chain. 
By applying the principle of detailed balance to the master equation the calculation 
of the transition rates for the first and 2V-th element is straightforward and results are 
given, respectively, by 
«i(«i) = /'/ 2 (! — W z ) >

(19) 
after inserting the above values of WjiSj) and coN(sN) 
into (6) we obtain items (i) and 
(iii) in (18). 
An analysis of the dielectric properties of the finite chain was previously attempted 
by Anderson [26], who wrote a similar set of first-order differential equations and 
introduced some specific rates in describing the chain dynamics such as klt k2 for the 
interior elements of the chain, and k3, kA for the end elements. Note that Anderson 
has employed a numerical method for the solution of his rate equations. He has proved 
from the principle of detailed balance that 
( h l ^ ^ i h l K ) 
or 
k3 = p[k1 
+ (k1k2)^] 
and 
¿4 = M * 2 + (¿A) 1 / 2L 
(20) 
where p is called the chain-end mobility parameter. The relation between klt k2, k3, kA 
and /, /', y, r] is as follows: 
k, =

After inserting (21) into (20) and using the identity y = 2r][(l + i f ) we obtain the 
following relation: 
/'// = Pl( 1 + 
rf) 
(22) 
This equation shows that if /' < / , i.e. (p — 1) < i f , the rotatory motion of the 
parallel component is slower than that of the perpendicular component of the dipoles. 
We now present an analytical solution of (18) by the method derived by Bradbury 
[33], and later developed by Ninham et al. [34]. 
We first Laplace transform the set of differential equations given in (18) from time 
dependence to co dependence. Let Yj(co) be the Laplace transform of g1 of the complex 
argument, 
Y,(o>) = X[gi\ = J exp (-icot) gf(t) dt. 
(23) 
Then we get an expression for the response of the /-th element in the following form: 
F,(co) = fyl2 A(co)-i

Note that 
the matrix A(w) has a similar form as that of Ninham et al. and its subsequent analysis 
will be made following their method. We propose to write (24) subject to a given 
initial condition, say grr(0) = sr(0), in the following short form: 
F,(co) = 2{fy)~1 £ y[A(co)-^,TsT(0)

r = l

where [^(co)-1]^, is the j'-th row and r-th column matrix element of A(co)'1. But the

which is equivalent to (11) by definition. 
By inserting (27) into (13) we obtain the time-delayed dipole moment correlation 
function in terms of co and the spatial correlation term

The above expression becomes simplified if we consider only the auto-correlation 
term, which describes a single dipole element whose motion is somehow modified 
by cooperation of other dipoles along the chain, i.e. if we neglect all cross-correlation 
terms for i =j= j. After replacing i = j = N/2, where N should be even we get the 
expression for the decay of the dipole moment of the jV/2-th dipole located is the 
middle of the chain.

The matrix element [Zl(co)-1]^/2, r can be determined by taking the inversion of

A simple calculation of the inverse matrix Zl(co-1) can be done by using an elemtary

An Ising Model Analysis of Dielectric Polarization (I)

For higher orders, we find the following recurrence relation for ar and br: 
Dr = ar + ibr = 2J?(cos 6 + i sin 8) (ar_x -f- ibr_j) — (ar_2 + ibr-2) > 
where 
ar = 2i2(cos 0ar_i — 6r_ 1 sin 0) — ar_2 , 
6r = 2i2(sin 0ar_i + 6r_i cos 6) — £>r_2 . 
From now on, it is a simple matter to calculate e«(co). To do this, one should first 
calculate A, B, E, F, through (44) and (38) to (41) by using (COT) as the variable. Then 
put the calculated values of A, B, E, F for each value of cor into (43) to obtain each 
point for £«(&>). 
The results obtained in this way are plotted as log e„(co) versus log (cor) and the 
physical interpretation of the graphs and also their comparison with experimental 
evidences will be presented in Part II of this paper [28]. 
4. Discussion and Conclusions 
The main results of this paper may be summarized as follows: 
i) First of all, Glauber's time-dependent Ising model formalism has been success-
fully adapted to the analysis of the polarization for one-dimensional dipolar systems, 
such as polar long-chain polymers, hydrogen bonding systems, and ferroelectrics. 
ii) In the analysis of short dipolar chains, which is the novel part of this paper, we 
were able to present an analytical expression for the decay function of a single dipole 
located in a finite chain that results in a non-Debye type form, due to the many-body 
nature of the dipolar interactions. 
iii) In this paper we only considered the nearest-neighbour interaction (i.e. the 
exchange interaction) in calculating the time-delayed dipole correlation function. It 
is also desirable to know how longe-range dipole-dipole interaction influences the 
dielectric relaxation of a molecular chain. Studies along this line [35, 36] showed 
that only a limited effect on the departure from ideal Debye response is exerted. 
On the other hand, it was shown by many authors [5] that the exchange interaction 
has a considerable influence on the dielectric relaxation of their model systems, which 
is fully in agreement with our result. 
iv) However, we also realize that the expression obtained for the time-delayed 
dipole correlation function is not a realistic decay function, even for the Debye case 
t7<^l, because the non-zero time derivative at t = 0 predicts an instantaneous 
response when the field is switched off. In general, the decay function of this type 
cannot account for inertial effects and must lead to an incorrect dielectric behaviour 
at sufficiently high frequencies. Nevertheless, as will be shown in Part II of this paper 
[28] the success of this decay function regarding the qualitative agreement with 
experimental data is encouraging, since it implies that inertial effects should not be 
needed to explain the dielectric behaviour of materials having short-range dipolar 
chains.

Propagation of Displacement Pulses 
in Harmonic Crystals 
By 
A. CZACHOR and A. HOLAS 
The time evolution of the displacement field due to a localized initial pulse is calculated for a har-
monic crystal. It is analyzed in detail for some simple phonon dispersion relations and for propaga-
tion in symmetric directions. The front of the pulse usually travels with sound velocity, except the 
case of a concave dispersion relation — the velocity is then different (higher). A "thought" experi-
ment in which the dispersion relation may be determined from the analysis of the time profile of 
the arriving signal is considered.
