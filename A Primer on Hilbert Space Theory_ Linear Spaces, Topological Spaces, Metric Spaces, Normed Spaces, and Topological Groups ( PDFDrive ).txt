Preface
About the Book
This textbook is a treatment of the structure of abstract spaces, in particular linear,
topological, metric, and normed spaces, as well as topological groups, in a rigorous
and reader-friendly fashion. The assumed background knowledge on the part of the
reader is modest, limited to basic concepts of ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces and
elementary analysis. The book’s aim is to serve as an introduction toward the theory
of Hilbert spaces and the theory of operators.
The formalism of Hilbert spaces is fundamental to Physics, and in particular to
Quantum Mechanics, requiring a certain amount of ﬂuency with the techniques of
linear algebra, metric space theory, and topology. Typical introductory level books
devoted to Hilbert spaces assume a signiﬁcant level of familiarity with the necessary
background material and consequently present only a brief review of it. A reader
who ﬁnds the overview insufﬁcient is forced to consult other sources to ﬁll the gap.
Assuming only a rudimentary understanding of real analysis and linear algebra, this
book offers an introduction to the mathematical prerequisites of Hilbert space
theory in a single self-contained source. The ﬁnal chapter is devoted to topological
groups, offering a glimpse toward more advanced theory. The text is suitable for
advanced undergraduate or introductory graduate courses for both Physics and
Mathematics students.
The Structure of the Book
The book consists of six chapters, with an additional chapter of solved problems
arranged by topic. Each chapter is composed of ﬁve sections, with each section
accompanied by a set of exercises (with the exception of Chap. 6, which is shorter,
vii

and thus contains a single batch of exercises located at the end of the chapter). The
total of 210 exercises and 50 solved problems comprise an integral part of the book
designed to assist the reader, challenge her, and hone her intuition.
Chapter 1 contains a general introduction to real analysis and, in particular, to
each of the subjects presented in the chapters that follow. Chapter 1 also contains a
Preliminaries section, intended to quickly orient the reader as to the notation and
concepts used throughout the book, starting with sets and ending with an axiomatic
presentation of the real numbers.
Chapter 2 is devoted to linear spaces. At the advanced undergraduate level the
reader is already familiar with at least some aspects of linear spaces, primarily ﬁnite
dimensional ones. The chapter does not rely on any previous knowledge though,
and is in that sense self-contained. However, the material is somewhat advanced
since the focus is inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces, which are technically relatively
demanding.
Chapter 3 is an introduction to topology, a subject considered to be at a rather
high level of abstraction. The main aim of the chapter is to familiarize the reader
with the fundamentals of the theory, and in particular those that are most directly
relevant for real analysis and Hilbert spaces. Care is taken to ﬁnding a reasonable
balance between the study of extreme topology, i.e., spaces or phenomena that one
may consider pathological but that hone the topological intuition, and mundane
topology, i.e., those spaces or phenomena one is most likely to ﬁnd in nature, but
which may obscure the true nature of topology.
Chapter 4 is a study of metric spaces. Once the necessary fundamentals are
covered, the main focus is complete metric spaces. In particular, the Banach Fixed-
Point Theorem and Baire’s Theorem are proved and completions are discussed,
topics which are indispensable for Hilbert space theory.
Chapter 5 introduces and studies normed spaces and Banach spaces. Starting
with semi-normed spaces the chapter establishes the fundamentals, and goes on to
introduce Banach spaces, treating the Open Mapping Theorem, the Hahn-Banach
Theorem, the Closed Graph Theorem, and, alluding to Hilbert space theory proper,
the Riesz Representation Theorem.
Chapter 6 is a short introduction to topological groups, emphasizing their rela-
tion to Banach spaces. The chapter does not assume any knowledge of group
theory, and thus, to remain self-contained, it presents all relevant group-theoretic
notions. The chapter ends with a treatment of uniform spaces and a hint of their
usefulness in the general theory.
A Word About the Intended Audience
The book is aimed at the advanced undergraduate or beginning postgraduate level,
with the general prerequisite of sufﬁcient mathematical maturity as expected at that
level of studies. The book should be of interest to the student knowing nothing of
viii
Preface

Hilbert space theory who wishes to master its prerequisites. The book should also
be useful to the reader who is already familiar with some aspects of Hilbert space
theory, linear spaces, topology, or metric spaces, as the book contains all the
relevant deﬁnitions and pivotal theorems in each of the subjects it covers. More-
over, the book contains a chapter on topological groups and a treatment of uniform
spaces, a topic usually considered at a more advanced level.
A Word About the Authors
The authors of the book, a physicist and a mathematician, by writing the entire book
together, and through many arguments about notation and style, hope that this clash
between the desires of a physicist to quickly yet intelligibly get to the point and the
insistence of a mathematician on rigor and conciseness did not leave the pages of
this book tainted with blood, but rather that it resulted in a welcoming introduction
for both physicists and mathematicians interested in Hilbert space theory.
Prof. Carlo Alabiso obtained his Degree in Physics at Milan University, Italy,
and then taught for more than 40 years at Parma University, Parma, Italy (with a
period spent as a research fellow at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and at
Cern, Geneva). His teaching encompassed topics in Quantum Mechanics, special
relativity, ﬁeld theory, elementary particle physics, mathematical physics, and
functional analysis. His research ﬁelds include mathematical physics (Padé ap-
proximants), elementary particle physics (symmetries and quark models), and sta-
tistical physics (ergodic problems), and he has published articles in a wide range of
national and international journals as well as the previous Springer book (with
Alessandro Chiesa), Problemi di Meccanica Quantistica non Relativistica.
Dr. Ittay Weiss completed his B.Sc. and M.Sc. studies in Mathematics at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem and he obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics from
Universiteit Utrecht in The Netherlands. He spent an additional 3 years in Utrecht
as an assistant professor of mathematics where he taught mathematics courses
across the entire undergraduate spectrum both at Utrecht University and at the
afﬁliated University College Utrecht. He is currently a mathematics lecturer at the
University of the South Paciﬁc. His research interests lie in the ﬁelds of algebraic
topology and operad theory, as well as the mathematical foundations of analysis
and generalizations of metric spaces.

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview
Hilbert space theory is the mathematical formalism for non-relativistic Quantum
Mechanics. A Hilbert space is a linear space together with an inner product that
endows the space with the structure of a complete metric space. Hilbert space theory
is thus a fusion of algebra, topology, and geometry.
The reader is already familiar with the intermingling of algebra and geometry,
namely in the linear space Rn. Elements in Rn can be thought of as points in n-
dimensional space but also as vectors. Typically, points have coordinates and vectors
can be added and scaled. Moreover, in the presence of the standard inner product,
given by ⟨x, y⟩= n
k=1 xk yk, the length of a vector is given by the norm
∥x∥=

⟨x, x⟩
and the angle between vectors can be computed by means of the formula
θ = arccos ⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥.
At this level, the interaction between the algebra and the geometry is quite smooth.
Things change though as soon as one considers inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces,
and this is also where topology comes into the picture. For ﬁnite dimensional lin-
ear spaces, bases (and thus coordinates) are readily available, all linear operators
are continuous, convergence of operators has a single meaning, any linear space is

naturally isomorphic to its double dual, and the closed unit ball is compact. These
conveniences do not exist in the inﬁnite dimensional case. While bases do exist, the
proof of their existence is non-constructive and more often than not no basis can
be given explicitly. Consequently, techniques that rely on coordinates and matrices
are generally unsuitable. Linear operators need not be continuous, and in fact many
linear operators of interest are not continuous. The space consisting of all linear
operators between two linear spaces carries two different topologies, and thus two
different notions of convergence. The correct notion of the dual space is that of all
continuous linear operators into the ground ﬁeld and even then the original space
only embeds in its double dual. Lastly, the closed unit ball is not compact.
In a sense, the aim of Hilbert space theory is to develop adequate machinery to
be able to reason about, and in, inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces subject to these
inherentdifﬁcultiesandtopologicalsubtleties.Themathematicsbackgroundrequired
for the study of Hilbert spaces thus includes linear algebra, topology, the theory of
metric spaces, and the theory of normed spaces. The theory of topological groups,
a fusion between group theory and topology, arises naturally as well. Before we
proceed to elaborate on each of these topics we visit the most fundamental space of
them all, that of the real numbers.
1.1.1 The Real Numbers—Where it All Begins
Most fundamental to human observation of the outside world are the real numbers.
The outcome of a measurement is almost always assumed to be a real number (at
least in some ideal sense). That this idealization is deeply ingrained in the scientiﬁc
lore is witnessed by the very name of the real numbers; among all numbers, these
are the real ones! Whatever the reason may be for science’s strong preference for
the real numbers is a debate for philosophers. We merely observe that, whether the
use of real numbers is justiﬁed or not, the success of the real numbers in science is
unquestionable.
Mathematically though, the real numbers pose several non-trivial challenges. One
of those challenges is the very deﬁnition of the real numbers, or, in other words,
answering the question: what is a real number? For the ancient Greeks, roughly
speaking until the Pythagoreans, the real numbers were taken for granted as being
the same as what we would today call the rationals. That was the commonly held
belief until the discovery that
√
2 is an irrational number (the precise circumstances
of that discovery are unclear). The construction of precise models for the reals had
to wait numerous centuries, and so did the discovery of transcendental numbers and
the understanding of just how many real numbers there are.

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview

1.1.1.1 Constructing the Real Numbers
The reader is likely to have her own personal idea(lization) regarding what the real
numbers really are. Any precise interpretation or elucidation of the true entities
which are the real numbers belongs to philosophy. Choosing to stay ﬁrmly afoot in
mathematics, we present now one of many precise constructions of a model of the
real numbers. As with the construction of any model, one can not construct something
from nothing. We thus assume the reader accepts the existence of (a model of) the
rational numbers. In other words, we pretend to agree on what the rational numbers
are, but to have no knowledge of the real number system. We will give the precise
construction but, to remain in the spirit of an introduction, we avoid the details of
the proofs.
To motivate the following construction of the real numbers from the rational
numbers, recall that the rational numbers are dense in the real numbers, meaning that
between any two real numbers there exists a rational number. This simple observation
gives rise to the crucial fact that every real number is the limit of a sequence of rational
numbers. Thus, the convergent sequences of rational numbers give us access to all of
the real numbers. Since many different sequences of rational numbers may converge
to the same real number, the set of all convergent sequences of rational numbers is
too wasteful to be taken as the deﬁnition of the real numbers. One needs to introduce
an equivalence relation on it, one that identiﬁes two sequences of rational numbers
if they converge to the same real number.
To conclude the discussion so far, if S denotes the set of all convergent sequences
of rational numbers, then we expect to be able to identify an equivalence relation ∼
on S such that S/∼forms a model of the real numbers. However, to even take the
ﬁrst step in this plan without committing the sin of a circular argument, one must
ﬁrst be able to identify the convergent sequences among all sequences of rational
numbers without any a-priori knowledge of the real numbers. That task is achieved
by appealing to the familiar notion of a Cauchy sequence, a condition which, for
sequences of real numbers, is well-known to be equivalent to convergence. The key
observation is that the Cauchy condition for sequences of rational numbers can be
stated without mentioning real numbers at all. In this way the convergent sequences
of rational numbers are carved from the set of all sequences of rationals by means
of an inherently rational criterion.
The construction we give is due to Georg Cantor, the creator of the theory of sets.
On the set Q of rational numbers, which we assume is endowed with the familiar
notions of addition and multiplication, and thus also with the notions of subtraction
and division, consider the function d : Q × Q →Q given by d(x, y) = |x −y|.
We now deﬁne a Cauchy sequence to be a sequence (xn) of rational numbers which
satisﬁes the condition that for every rational number ε > 0 there exists N ∈N such
that d(xn, xm) < ε for all n, m > N. Let now S be the set of all Cauchy sequences
and deﬁne the relation ∼on S as follows. Given Cauchy sequences (xn), (yn) ∈S,
declare that (xn) ∼(yn) if d(xn, yn) →0. Note that convergence to 0 (or any other
rational number) of a sequence of rational numbers can be stated without assuming

Introduction and Preliminaries
the existence of real numbers. Indeed, the meaning of (xn) ∼(yn) is that for every
rational number ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that d(xn, yn) < ε for all n > N.
It is a straightforward matter to show that ∼is an equivalence relation on S.
We now deﬁne the set of real numbers to be R = S/∼, namely the quotient set
determined by the equivalence relation. One immediate thing to notice is that R
contains a copy of Q. Indeed, for any rational number q ∈Q consider the constant
sequence xq = (xn = q). It is clearly a Cauchy sequence, and thus xq ∈S, and
its equivalence class [xq] is thus, per deﬁnition, a real number. Further, if q′ ̸= q is
another rational, then [xq] ̸= [xq′] since the respective constant sequences are not
equivalent, and thus not identiﬁed in the quotient set. In other words, the function
q →[xq] is an injection from Q to R.
The familiar algebraic structure of Q carries over to R as follows. Given real
numbers x, y, represented by Cauchy sequences (xn) and (yn) respectively, the sum
x + y is deﬁned to be represented by (xn + yn) and the product xy to be repre-
sented by (xnyn). Of course, one needs to check these are well-deﬁned notions, i.e.,
that the proposed sequences are Cauchy and that the resulting sum and product are
independent of the choice of representatives. This veriﬁcation, especially for the
sum, is straightforward. Once that is done, the veriﬁcation of the familiar algebraic
properties of addition and multiplication is easily performed, proving the R is a ﬁeld.
Similarly, the order structure of Q carries over to R by deﬁning, for real numbers x
and y as above, that x ≤y if either x = y or if xn ≤yn for all but ﬁnitely many n. It
is quite straightforward to verify that R is then an ordered ﬁeld. Finally, and by far
least trivially, R satisﬁes the least upper bound property, proving that it is Dedekind
complete.
The embedding of Q in R described above is easily seen to respect the order and
algebraic structure of Q. Therefore the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers we started with
can be identiﬁed with its isomorphic copy in R, namely the image of the embedding
Q →R, and one then considers R as an extension of Q.
1.1.1.2 Transcendentals and Uncountablity
The divide of the real numbers into rational and irrational numbers represents the
ﬁrst fundamental indication of the complexity of the real numbers. Together with
the realization that
√
2 is an irrational number comes the necessity, if only out of
curiosity, of asking about the nature of other real numbers, for instance π and e.
The number e was introduced by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683 but it was only some
50 years later that Leonard Euler established its irrationality. In sharp contrast, the
number π, known since antiquity, was only shown to be irrational in 1761 by Johann
Heinrich Lambert. If this is not indication enough that the real number system holds
more secrets than one would superﬁcially expect, the fact that to date it is unknown
whether or not π + e is irrational should remove any doubt.
Some real numbers, while irrational, may still be nearly rational, in the following
sense. Consider a rational number r = p/q. Clearly, r satisﬁes the equation

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview

qt −p = 0,
and thus r is a root of a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients. More generally, any
real number which is a root of a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients is called an
algebraic number. For instance,
√
2 is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial
t2 −2. A real number that is not algebraic is called transcendental. The existence
of transcendental numbers was not established until 1844 by Joseph Liouville who,
shortly afterwards, constructed the ﬁrst explicit example of a transcendental number
(albeit a somewhat artiﬁcial one). More prominent members of the transcendental
class are the number e, proved transcendental by Charles Hermite in 1873, and the
number π, proved transcendental by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882. While much
is known about transcendental numbers, it is still unknown if π +e is algebraic or not.
In 1884 Georg Cantor, following shortly after Liouville’s proof of the existence
of transcendental numbers, proved not only that transcendental numbers exist but
also that in some sense the vast majority of all real numbers are transcendental.
The technique employed by Cantor was that of transﬁnite counting. With his notion
of cardinality of sets, Cantor counted how many algebraic numbers there are and
how many real numbers there are, and demonstrated that there are strictly more real
numbers than algebraic ones. The inevitable conclusion that transcendental numbers
exist, a conclusion that was met with some resistance, forces us to face the following
equally inevitable truth. Similarly to Cantor’s counting of the algebraic numbers one
can also count all sentences in any given natural language, for instance English. As
it turns out, the cardinality of all potential English descriptions of real numbers is the
same as the cardinality of the algebraic numbers, and thus is strictly smaller than the
cardinality of all real numbers. We must now conclude that there exist real numbers
that can not ever, even potentially, be described in any way at all.
We now end this short historical excursion and turn to quickly address the main
topics covered in this book.
1.1.2 Linear Spaces
A linear space, also known as a vector space, embodies what is perhaps the simplest
notion of a mathematical space. When thought of as modeling actual physical space,
a linear space appears to be the same in all directions and is completely devoid of
any curvature. Linear spaces, and the closely related notion of linear transformation
or linear operator, are fundamental objects. For instance, the derivative of a function
at a point is best understood as a linear operator on tangent spaces, particularly for
functions of several variables. Differentiable manifolds are spaces which may be
very complicated but, at each point, they are locally linear. It is perhaps somewhat of
an exaggeration, but it is famously held to be true that if a problem can be linearized,
then it is as good as solved.

Introduction and Preliminaries
1.1.3 Topological Spaces
Topology is easy to deﬁne but hard to explain. The ideas that led to the development
of topology were lurking beneath the surface for some time and it is difﬁcult to
pinpoint the exact time in history when topology was born. What is clear is that
after its birth the advancement of topology in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century was
rapid. The unifying power of topology is immense and its explanatory ability is a
powerful one. For instance, familiar theorems of ﬁrst year real analysis, such as the
existence of maxima and minima for continuous functions on a closed interval, or
the uniform continuity of a continuous function on a closed interval, may make the
closed interval appear to have special signiﬁcance. Topology is able to clarify the
situation, identifying a particular topological property of the closed interval, namely
that it is compact, as the key ingredient enabling the proof to carry over into much
more general situations.
1.1.4 Metric Spaces
Metric spaces appeared in 1906 in the Ph.D dissertation of Maurice Réne Fréchet.
A metric space is a set where one can measure distances between points, and in
a strong sense a metric space carries much more geometric information than can
be described by a topological space. With stronger axioms come stronger theorems
but also less examples. However, the axioms of a metric space allow for a vast
and varied array of examples and the theorems one can prove are very strong. In
particular, complete metric spaces, i.e., those that, intuitively, have no holes, admit
two very strong theorems. One is the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem and the second is
Baire’s Theorem. The former can be used to solve, among other things, differential
equations, while the latter has deep consequences to the structure of complete metric
spaces and to continuous functions.
1.1.5 Normed Spaces and Banach Spaces
A very basic attribute one can associate with a vector is its norm, i.e., its length. The
abstract formalism is given by the axioms of a normed space. The presence of a norm
allows one to deﬁne the distance between any two vectors, by the so-called induced
metric, and one obtains a metric space, as well as the topology it induces. Thus any
normed space immediately incorporates both algebra and geometry. A Banach space
is a normed space which, as a metric space, is complete. The interaction between
the algebra and the geometry is then particularly powerful, allowing for very strong
results.

1.1 Hilbert Space Theory—A Quick Overview

1.1.6 Topological Groups
Banach spaces are a fusion of algebra and geometry. Similarly, topological groups are
a fusion between algebra and topology. Unlike a Banach space, the algebraic structure
is that of a group while the geometry is reduced from a metric to a topology. Thus, a
topological group is a much weaker structure than a Banach space, yet the interaction
between the algebra and the topology still gives rise to a very rich and interesting
theory.
1.2 Preliminaries
The aim of this section is to recount some of the fundamental notions of set theory,
the common language for rigorous mathematical discussions. It serves to quickly
orient the reader with respect to the notation used throughout the book as well as
to present fundamental results on cardinals and demonstrate the technique of Zorn’s
Lemma. This section is designed to be skimmed through and only consulted for a
more detailed reading if needed further on. For that reason, and unlike the rest of the
book, the style of presentation in this section is rather condensed.
1.2.1 Sets
The notion of a set is taken to be a primitive notion, left undeﬁned. In an axiomatic
approach to sets one lists certain well formulated and carefully chosen axioms, while
in a naive approach one relies on a common understanding of what sets are, avoiding
the technical difﬁculties of precise deﬁnitions at the cost of some rigor. We adopt the
naive approach and thus for us a set is a collection of elements, where no repetitions
are allowed and no ordering of the elements of the set is assumed.
1.2.2 Common Sets
Among the sets we will encounter are the sets N = {1, 2, 3, . . .} of natural numbers,
Z = {. . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .} of integers, Q = {p/q | p, q ∈Z, q ̸= 0}
of rational numbers, R of real numbers, and C = {x + iy | x, y ∈R} of complex
numbers. The notation illustrates two commonly occurring ways for introducing sets,
the informal . . . which is meant to indicate that the reader knows what the author
had in mind, and the precise form {x ∈X | P(x)}, to be interpreted as the set of all
those elements x in X satisfying property P. The empty set is denoted by ∅, and it

8
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
simply has no elements in it. A set {x}, consisting of just a single element, is called
a singleton set.
1.2.3 Relations Between Sets
The notation x ∈X was already used above to indicate that x is a member of the set
X. To indicate that x is not a member of X we write x /∈X. Two sets X and Y may
have the property that any element x ∈X is also a member of Y, a situation denoted
by X ⊆Y, meaning that X is contained in Y, X is a subset of Y, Y contains X, and
that Y is a superset of X. If moreover X ̸= Y, then X is said to be a proper subset
of Y, denoted by X ⊂Y. In particular, X ⊂Y means that every element x ∈X
satisﬁes x ∈Y and that for at least one element y ∈Y it holds that y /∈X. An often
useful observation is that two sets X and Y are equal, denoted by X = Y, if, and
only if, X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X.
1.2.4 Families of Sets; Union and Intersection
Any set I may serve as an indexing set for a set of sets. In that case it is customary to
speak of a family of sets, a collection of sets, or an indexed set. For instance, consider
I = [0, 1] = {t ∈R | 0 ≤t ≤1}, and for each t ∈I let Xt = (0, t) = {x ∈R |
0 < x < t}. Then {Xt}t∈I is a family of sets indexed by I. For any such indexed
collection, its union is the set

i∈I
Xi
which is the set of all those elements x that belong to Xi for some i ∈I (that may
depend on x). Moreover, if Xi ∩X j = ∅for all i, j ∈I with i ̸= j, then the
collection is said to be pairwise disjoint and the union is then said to be a disjoint
union. The intersection of the collection is the set

i∈I
Xi
which is the set of all those elements x that belong to Xi for all i ∈I. For the indexed
collection given above one may verify that

t∈I
Xt = (0, 1)

1.2 Preliminaries
9
and that

t∈I
Xt = ∅.
When the indexing set is ﬁnite, one typically writes
X1 ∪X2 ∪· · · ∪Xn
and
X1 ∩X2 ∩· · · ∩Xn
for the union and intersection, respectively.
1.2.5 Set Difference, Complementation, and De Morgan’s Laws
The set difference X −Y is the set {x ∈X | x /∈Y}. In the presence of a universal
set or a set of discourse, that is a set U which is the relevant ambient set in a given
context, the complement of a set X ⊆U is the set Xc = {y ∈U | y /∈X}. In other
words, Xc = U −X. Needless to say, the notation Xc pre-supposes knowledge of U,
and different choices of U yield different complements. In this context we mention
that the set difference X −Y is also known as the relative complement of X in Y.
Among the many properties of sets and the operations of union, intersection, and
complementation we only mention De Morgan’s laws: given any indexed collection
{Xi}i∈I of subsets of a set X, the equalities
(

and
(

both hold. Here the complements are relative to the set X.
1.2.6 Finite Cartesian Products
Given m sets (m ≥1), X1, . . . , Xm, their cartesian product is the set
X1 × · · · × Xm = {(x1, . . . , xm) | xk ∈Xk, for all 1 ≤k ≤m}.

10
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
In other words, the cartesian product of m sets X1, . . . , Xm (in that order) is the set
consisting of all m-tuples where the k-th component (for 1 ≤k ≤m) is taken from
the k-th set. In case Xk = X for all 1 ≤k ≤m, the cartesian product is denoted by
Xm and is called the m-fold cartesian product of X with itself.
1.2.7 Functions
Given any two sets X and Y, a function or a mapping, denoted by f : X →Yor
X
f
 Y is, informally, a rule that associates with each element x ∈X an element
f (x) ∈Y. More formally, a function f : X →Y is a subset f ⊆X × Y satisfying
the property that for all x ∈X and y1, y2 ∈Y, if (x, y1) ∈f and (x, y2) ∈f ,
then y1 = y2, and that for all x ∈X there exists some y ∈Y with (x, y) ∈f . The
set X is the domain of the function while Y is the codomain. For any set X there
is always the identity function idX : X →X given by idX(x) = x. Further, given
functions f : X →Y and g : Y →Z, their composition is deﬁned to be the function
g ◦f : X →Z given by (g ◦f )(x) = g( f (x)). It is obvious that composition of
functions is associative, that is, if
X1
f
 X2
g
 X3
h
 X4,
then
h ◦(g ◦f ) = (h ◦g) ◦f.
A function f : X →Y is injective or one-to-one if f (x1) = f (x2) implies x1 = x2,
for all x1, x2 ∈X. A function f : X →Y is surjective or onto if for all y ∈Y there
exists an x ∈X such that f (x) = y. A function f : X →Y is called bijective or
invertible if it is both injective and surjective. Equivalently, a function f : X →Y
is invertible if there exists a function f −1 : Y →X, called the inverse of f , such
that f ◦f −1 = idY and f −1 ◦f = idX. Such an inverse, if it exists, is easily seen
to be unique.
Given a function f : X →Y and a subset S ⊆X, the restriction of f to S is the
function g : S →Y given by g(s) = f (s). This restriction function is denoted by
f |S. We also mention that any two sets X and Y with X ⊆Y give rise to the inclusion
function ι : X →Y, deﬁned by ι(x) = x. Note that the inclusion function differs
from the identity function only by the codomain, not by the functional assignments.

1.2 Preliminaries
11
1.2.8 Arbitrary Cartesian Products
The cartesian product of any indexed family {Xi}i∈I of sets is the set
{ f : I →

i∈I
Xi | f (i) ∈Xi, ∀i ∈I}.
To justify the deﬁnition, observe that when I = {1, 2, 3, . . . , m}, each function f as
above can be uniquely identiﬁed with the m-tuple ( f (1), f (2), . . . , f (m)), in other
words, with an element of X1 × · · · × Xm, so this deﬁnition recovers the deﬁnition
of the cartesian product of ﬁnitely many sets, as given above. When Xi = X for all
i ∈I, the cartesian product is denoted by X I. Notice that X I is simply the set of all
functions f : I →X.
1.2.9 Direct and Inverse Images
The power set of a set X is the set of all subsets of X, and is denoted by P(X).
Every function f : X →Y induces the direct image function f : P(X) →P(Y),
denoted again by f , given by f (A) = { f (a) | a ∈A}, for all A ⊆X (notice
that this deﬁnition introduces a new way to construct sets). Similarly, any function
f : X →Y induces the inverse image function f −1 : P(Y) →P(X), which, for
every B ⊆Y, is given by f −1(B) = {x ∈X | f (x) ∈B}. Notice that f −1(Y) = X
but that the inclusion f (X) ⊆Y may be proper. The set f (X) is called the image of
f . Note that f (X) = Y if, and only if, f is surjective. We remark that the notation
f −1 for the inverse image conﬂicts with the notation for the inverse function of f
(when it exists) and thus some care should be exercised.
The following properties of functions are easily veriﬁed. If X
f
 Y
g
 Z
are functions and S ⊆Z is a subset, then
(g ◦f )−1(S) = f −1(g−1(S)).
Further, for all subsets S1, S2 ⊆Y,
f −1(S1 ∩S2) = f −1(S1) ∩f −1(S2)
and
f −1(S1 ∪S2) = f −1(S1) ∪f −1(S2).
More generally, given any collection {Si}i∈I of subsets of Y,

1.2.10 Indicator Functions
Let S be the set {0, 1} and ﬁx some set X. The subsets of X are easily seen to be in
bijective correspondence with the functions X →S. The correspondence is given as
follows. Given a subset S ⊆X let F(S) : X →S be given by
F(S)(x) =

1 if x ∈S
0 if x /∈S.
The function F(S) is called the indicator function of the subset S ⊆X. Conversely,
given any function f : X →S, the subset of X it determines is G( f ) = f −1({1}). It
is easily veriﬁed that F and G are each other’s inverses, setting up the stated bijective
correspondence. Note that f −1({0}) is the complement X −f −1({1}).
1.2.11 Cardinality
Two sets X and Y are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection
f : X →Y, in which case we write |X| = |Y|. If there is an injection f : X →Y,
then X is said to have cardinality less than or equal to that of Y, and we write
|X| ≤|Y|.
Two ﬁnite sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, they have the same number
of elements. It is thus common to write |X| for a ﬁnite set X to indicate the number
of elements in X.
A set X is said to be countable if it is empty or if there exists a surjective function
f : N →X. Equivalently, a set is countable if it has the same cardinality as some
subset of N. Equivalently still, a set X is countable precisely when there exists an
injective function X →N. A set that is both countable and inﬁnite is said to be
countably inﬁnite. A set that is not countable is called uncountable. A set which has
the same cardinality as R is said to have the cardinality of the continuum. Examples
of countable sets include every ﬁnite set, the set N, as well as the set Z of integers
and the set Q of rational numbers. Sets of the cardinality of the continuum include
the set R of real numbers as well as C of complex number, the n-fold products Rn
and Cn for any n ∈N, as well as the power-set P(N), namely the set of all subsets

of natural numbers, and the set of all continuous functions f : R →R. Uncountable
sets of cardinality larger than that of the continuum include the power-set P(R) of
all subsets of real numbers, as well as the set of all functions f : R →R.
1.2.12 The Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein Theorem
The result we present now is a very convenient tool in establishing that two sets have
the same cardinality.
Theorem 1.1 (Cantor–Shröder–Bernstein) For all sets X and Y, if |X| ≤|Y| and
|Y| ≤|X|, then |X| = |Y|.
Proof By the condition in the assertion, there exists an injective function f : X →Y
and an injective function g : Y →X. To construct a bijection h : X →Y, we
consider the behaviour of elements in both X and Y with respect to the given functions
f and g. Notice that since g is injective, the inverse image g−1(x0), for any x0 ∈X,
is either empty or is of the form {y0}, where g(y0) = x0. Similarly, f −1(y1), for
any y1 ∈Y, is either empty or is of the form {x1} with f (x1) = y1. We thus write
f −1(y1) = x1 and g−1(x0) = y0, when these sets are not empty. Starting with
x0 ∈X we may successively consider the sequence
x0 →g−1(x0) = y0 →f −1(y0) = x1 →g−1(x1) = y1 →· · ·
where at each step we apply f −1 or g−1 alternatively, if they exist. Such a sequence
exhibits precisely one of three possible behaviours. It may be inﬁnite, in which case
x0 is said to have type ∞, or it may terminate since g−1(xk) was empty, in which
case x0 is said to have type X, or the sequence may stop due to the fact that f −1(yk)
was empty, in which case x0 is said to have type Y. In exactly the same way, each
element of Y can be classiﬁed as having precisely one type, either type ∞, or type
X or type Y.
Let us now denote by X∞all type ∞elements in X, by X X all type X elements
in X, and by XY all type Y elements in X. Similarly, introduce the notation Y∞, YX,
and YY . Thus
X = X∞∪X X ∪XY
and the union is pairwise disjoint. Similarly we obtain the pairwise disjoint union
Y = Y∞∪YX ∪YY .

1.2.13 Countable Arithmetic
Theorem 1.2 A subset of a countable set is countable.
Proof Suppose a set X is countable and S ⊆X is a subset. If S = ∅, then it is
countable, so we may assume S ̸= ∅and let us ﬁx some s0 ∈S. Since X is countable,
there exists a surjection f : N →X. Clearly, there is a surjection g : X →S (for
instance, g(x) = x if x ∈S, and g(x) = s0 if x /∈S) and, since the composition of
surjective functions is surjective, the function g ◦f : N →S is surjective, showing
that S is countable.
□
Theorem 1.3 The cartesian product of ﬁnitely many countable sets is countable.
Proof Let X1, . . . , Xm be countable sets and choose, for each 1 ≤k ≤m, an
injective function fk : Xk →N. These functions together give rise to
f : X1 × · · · × Xm →Nm
given by
f (x1, . . . , xm) = ( f1(x1), . . . , fm(xm)),
which is clearly injective. Now ﬁx m distinct prime numbers p1, . . . , pm and let
g : Nm →N
be given by
g(n1, . . . , nm) = pn1
1 · · · · · pnm
m .
The fact that every natural number has an essentially unique decomposition into
prime factors implies that g is injective. To conclude then, the composition

 N
is injective, and thus X1 × · · · × Xm is countable.

Theorem 1.4 A countable union of countable sets is itself countable.
Proof Let{Xm}m∈N beacountablefamilyofcountablesets.Wemayassume,without
loss of generality, that the collection is pairwise disjoint and that Xm ̸= ∅for all
m ∈N. Since each Xm is countable, there exists a surjective function fm : N →Xm.
Let

and deﬁne now the function
g : N × N →X
by
g(m, n) = fm(n),
which is clearly surjective. To ﬁnish the proof, note that N × N, being the product of
two countable sets, is countable, and thus there is a surjection h : N →N × N. The
composition

is thus a surjection, proving that X is countable.

1.2.14 Relations
A relation R on a set X is a subset R ⊆X × X, but we write x Ry instead of
(x, y) ∈R. The relation R is said to be reﬂexive if x Rx holds for all x ∈X. The
relation R is symmetric if x Ry implies yRx, for all x, y ∈X. The relation R is
anti-symmetric if, for all x, y ∈X, the assertions x Ry and yRx together imply that
x = y. Finally, the relation R is said to be transitive if x Ry and yRz together imply
x Rz, for all x, y, z ∈X.
1.2.15 Equivalence Relations
A relation R on a set X is called an equivalence relation if it is reﬂexive, symmetric,
and transitive, in which case we denote R by ∼, and thus write x ∼y instead of
x Ry. If x ∼y we say that x and y are equivalent. A partition of X is a collection
{Xi}i∈I of non-empty pairwise disjoint subsets of X such that 
i∈I Xi = X.

16
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
Given a partition {Xi}i∈I of X, deﬁning x ∼y precisely when there exists an
i ∈I with x, y ∈Xi is easily seen to deﬁne an equivalence relation. If we denote by
Par(X) the set of all partitions of X and by Equ(X) the set of all equivalence relations
on X, then the process just described deﬁnes a function E : Par(X) →Equ(X).
Conversely, given an equivalence relation ∼on X we may deﬁne, for each x ∈X,
the set
[x] = {y ∈X | x ∼y}
of all those elements y ∈X which are equivalent to x. This set is known as the
equivalence class of x, and x is called a representative of the equivalence class [x]
(if it is important to emphasize the relation ∼, then we write [x]∼). It can easily be
veriﬁed that two elements x, y ∈X represent the same equivalence class, that is
[x] = [y], if, and only if, x ∼y. It is completely straightforward to demonstrate
that the set {[x] | x ∈X} of all equivalence classes is a partition of X, and we thus
obtain a function P : Equ(X) →Par(X). It is quite easy to verify that in fact P is
the inverse function of E and thus we have established a bijective correspondence
between equivalence classes on X and partitions of X.
Given an equivalence relation ∼on a set X, the set {[x] | x ∈X} is denoted by
X/∼and is called the quotient set of X modulo ∼. There is also the corresponding
function π : X →X/∼, given by π(x) = [x], called the canonical projection.
1.2.16 Ordered Sets
A poset (short for partially ordered set) is a pair (X, ≤) where X is a set and ≤is a
relation on X which is reﬂexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric.
Example 1.1 Given any set X, let P(X) be the set of all subsets of X. Deﬁning, for
subsets Y1, Y2 ⊆X, that Y1 ≤Y2 precisely when Y1 ⊆Y2, is easily seen to endow
P(X) with the structure of a poset. In this case we say that P(X) is ordered by set
inclusion. More generally, if A is some collection of subsets of X, then it too can be
endowed with the ordering induced by set inclusion, in precisely the same manner.
A related construction is to consider the set P of all pairs (Y, f ) where Y ⊆X and
f : Y →Z is a function to some ﬁxed set Z. Deﬁning (Y1, f1,) ≤(Y2, f2) when
Y1 ⊆Y2 and when f2 extends f1 (which means that f2(y) = f1(y) holds for all
y ∈Y1) is again easily seen to endow P with a poset structure. Again, one may
consider variants of this construction, for instance by demanding extra conditions on
the sets Y or on the functions f .
In the context of a general poset, the meaning of x < y is taken to be: x ≤y
and x ̸= y. The relations x > y and x ≥y are similarly derived from the given
relation ≤. Since not all elements x and y in a poset need be comparable (x and
y are comparable when either x ≤y or y ≤x), the correct interpretation of, for
instance, the negation of x ≤y is not that x > y but rather that either x and y are
incomparable, or x > y.

1.2 Preliminaries
17
1.2.17 Zorn’s Lemma
A poset P is said to be a total order or linearly ordered if for all x, y ∈P either
x ≤y or y ≤x holds. The poset P(X) discussed in Example 1.1 is linearly ordered
if, and only if, |X| ≤1.
Any subset S ⊆P in a poset (P, ≤) inherits a poset structure from P. We also
say that P induces a poset structure on S. In more detail, the poset S is given by
the ordering ⪯deﬁned, for all x, y ∈S, by x ⪯y precisely when x ≤y in P. We
usually do not make any notational distinction between ≤and the induced order ⪯,
and thus simply write x ≤y when referring to the ordering in S.
Deﬁnition 1.1 A chain in a poset P is a subset S ⊆P which, with the induced
ordering, is linearly ordered. An upper bound of a set S ⊆P (be it a chain or not)
is an element y ∈P such that x ≤y holds for all x ∈S. A maximal element in a
poset P is an element yM such that yM < x does not hold for any x ∈P.
Lemma 1.1 (Zorn’s Lemma) Let P be a non-empty poset. If every chain in P has
an upper bound, then P has a maximal element.
Zorn’s Lemma is a powerful result that is more of a proof technique than a lemma, in
much the same way as proof by induction is a proof technique rather than a lemma.
A proof of Zorn’s Lemma is subtle and in fact it is well-known that Zorn’s Lemma
is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.
1.2.18 A Typical Application of Zorn’s Lemma
Given any two sets X and Y, it is natural to wonder if their cardinalities compare.
That is, is it always the case that either |X| ≤|Y|, or |Y| ≤|X|? A positive answer
to this question turns out to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. We will only
prove half of this equivalence, primarily to illustrate a typical application of Zorn’s
Lemma.
Theorem 1.5 For all sets X and Y, either |X| ≤|Y| or |Y| ≤|X|.
Proof The case where either X or Y is empty is easily dispensed with, and so we
proceed under the assumption that both are non-empty. As a ﬁrst step we construct
a suitable poset, similar to the one given in Example 1.1.
Let P be the set of triples (X′, f, Y ′) where X′ ⊆X, Y ′ ⊆Y, and f : X′ →Y ′
is a bijective function. The partial order structure on P is given by
(X′, f, Y ′) ≤(X′′, g, Y ′′)
precisely when

18
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
X′ ⊆X′′
Y ′ ⊆Y ′′
g(x) = f (x) for all x ∈X′.
It is straightforward to verify that this is indeed a partial order.
Next, we show that (P, ≤) satisﬁes the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma. Firstly,
P ̸= ∅since the triple (∅, ∅, ∅) is always in P. Next, suppose that {(Xi, fi, Yi)}i∈I
is a chain in P, and we shall construct an upper bound for it. Let
X0 =

i∈I
Xi
Y0 =

i∈I
Yi
and f : X0 →Y0 given by
f (x) = fix (x).
Let us explain the deﬁnition of the function f . Given any x ∈X0, there is an ix ∈I
such that x ∈Xix . We may thus consider the value fix (x) ∈Yix ⊆Y0. However,
there may be another index i′
x ∈I with x ∈Xi′x , and a-priori,
fi′x (x) ̸= fix (x)
is a possibility. However, since {(Xi, fi, Yi)}i∈I is a chain, we may assume, without
loss of generality, that (Xix , fix , Yix ) ≤(Xi′x , fi′x , Yi′x ). But then, the deﬁnition of ≤
in P implies that
fi′x (x) = fix (x)
and so the function f : X0 →Y0 above is well-deﬁned. A similar argument shows
that f is bijective.
Now that we have veriﬁed the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma we are guaranteed of
the existence of a maximal element (X M, fM, YM) ∈P. That is, fM : X M →YM
is a bijective function for some X M ⊆X and YM ⊆Y. Let us now entertain the
possibility that both X M and YM are proper subsets. That is, that there exist elements
x! ∈X −X M and y! ∈Y −YM. But then we may deﬁne
X! = X M ∪{x!}
Y! = YM ∪{y!}
and f! : X! →Y! by

1.2 Preliminaries
19
f!(x) =

fM(x) if x ∈X M
y!
if x = x!
giving rise to the element (X!, f!, Y!) ∈P (the reader is invited to verify membership
in P) with
(X M, fM, YM) < (X!, f!, Y!),
contradicting the maximality of (X M, fM, YM).
We thus conclude that either X M = X or YM = Y. If X M = X, then the
composition X
fM  YM
incl.  Y
with the inclusion function yields an injec-
tion X →Y, thus showing that |X| ≤|Y|. If YM = Y, then the composition
Y
f −1
M  X M
incl.  X with the inclusion function is an injection Y →X, showing
that |Y| ≤|X|, and completing the proof.
□
1.2.19 The Real Numbers
The set R of real numbers may be constructed in numerous different ways and can
also be characterized axiomatically in different ways. We will not concern ourselves
here with the construction of a model of the reals, and thus accept their existence
and only state the axioms that govern them, namely that the reals form a Dedekind
complete totally ordered ﬁeld.
The statement that R, with addition and multiplication, is a ﬁeld is the claim that
the following axioms hold:
• Associativity of addition—for all a, b, c ∈R: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
• Commutativity of addition—for all a, b ∈R: a + b = b + a.
• Neutrality of 0—for all a ∈R: a + 0 = a = 0 + a.
• Existence of additive inverses—for all a ∈R there exists an element b ∈R with
a + b = 0 = b + a.
• Associativity of multiplication—for all a, b, c ∈R: (a · b) · c = a · (b · c).
• Commutativity of multiplication—for all a, b ∈R: a · b = b · a.
• Neutrality of 1—for all a ∈R: 1 · a = a = a · 1.
• Existence of reciprocals—for all a ∈R, if a ̸= 0, then there exists an element
b ∈R with a · b = 1 = b · a.
• Distributivity—for all a, b, c ∈R: a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c.
In general, any set K with addition and multiplication operations, and distinguished
elements 0 ̸= 1 in K, that satisfy these axioms is said to be a ﬁeld. For instance, both
C and Q, with the usual notion of addition and multiplication, are ﬁelds. In contrast,
Z with the same familiar addition and multiplication is not a ﬁeld.

20
1
Introduction and Preliminaries
The statement that the reals form an ordered ﬁeld is the claim that with the usual
notion of a ≤b for the real numbers, R is a totally ordered set, and that the following
axioms hold:
• For all a, b, c ∈R: a ≤b =⇒a + c ≤b + c.
• For all a, b, c ∈R with c ≥0: a ≤b =⇒a · c ≤b · c.
In general, a ﬁeld K with a total order on it such that these two axioms hold is called
an ordered ﬁeld. For instance, Q with the usual ordering is an ordered ﬁeld. For the
ﬁeld C, however, it can be shown without too much difﬁculty that no ordering of it
exists that turns it into an ordered ﬁeld.
Finally, perhaps the most important property of the real numbers, and certainly
one that sets it apart among all ordered ﬁelds, is its Dedekind completeness. Recall
that an upper bound for a subset S ⊆R is a real number a such that s ≤a for
all s ∈S. A supremum (or least upper bound) of S is an upper bound a with the
property that if b is any upper bound of S, then a ≤b. Similarly, one deﬁnes the
inﬁmum (or greatest lower bound) of S to be a lower bound which is not smaller
than any other lower bound. The statement that R is Dedekind complete is the claim:
any non-empty bounded above subset S ⊆R has a supremum. It can then be shown
that this property is equivalent to: any non-empty bounded below subset S ⊆R has
an inﬁmum.
In general, any Dedekind complete ordered ﬁeld can be taken as essentially the
ﬁeld of the real numbers. In other words, the axioms listed above of a Dedekind
complete ordered ﬁeld determine the reals up to an isomorphism, meaning that the
only difference between any two Dedekind complete ordered ﬁelds is the naming of
the elements.

for whatever reason, not elaborated upon in the main text.

analysis, i.e., to models of real numbers which contain actual inﬁnitesimals. The

Chapter 2
Linear Spaces
Abstract This chapter is a rigorous introduction to linear spaces, but with a strong
emphasis on inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces. No prior knowledge of linear spaces
is assumed, so that all deﬁnitions and proofs are included, but some mathematical
maturity is assumed, dictating the level of detail given. In particular, all results (e.g.,
existence of dimension) are given in full generality using Zorn’s Lemma.

sion · Quotient linear space · Product linear space · Inner product space · Normed
space · Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
This chapter assumes a rudimentary understanding of the linear structure of Rn,
a very rich structure, both algebraically and geometrically. Elements in Rn, when
thought of as vectors, that is as entities representing direction and magnitude, can
be used to form parallelograms, can be scaled, the angle between two vectors can
be computed, and the length of a vector can be found. These geometric features are
given algebraically by means of, respectively, vector addition, scalar multiplication,
the inner product of two vectors, and the norm of a vector. In this chapter these notions
are abstracted to give rise to the concepts of linear space, inner product space, and
normed space.
The chapter gives a detailed presentation of all of the relevant notions of linear
spaces, provides examples, and contains rigorous proofs of all of the results therein.
Exploiting the assumption of a rudimentary understanding of the linear structure of
Rn, and thus of ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces, the chapter has a clear secondary
goal, namely to explore the subtleties of inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces. This
is an absolute necessity with Hilbert spaces in mind, since virtually all interesting
examples of Hilbert spaces are inﬁnite dimensional.
A consequence of this inﬁnite dimensional theme of the chapter is that some
proofs are considerably more involved than their ﬁnite dimensional counterparts.
In particular, the theorems establishing the existence of bases and the concept of
dimension are sophisticated and resort to an application of Zorn’s Lemma. Also,
cardinality considerations are important, since one needs to be able to compute, at
least a little bit, with inﬁnite quantities. To facilitate an easier reading of this chapter,

Linear Spaces
the Preliminaries contain an account of Zorn’s Lemma (Sect.1.2.17) and some basic
cardinal arithmetic (Sects.1.2.12 and 1.2.13). Moreover, the text below indicates
which proofs can safely be skipped on a ﬁrst reading, leaving it to the discretion of
the reader when, and whether, to tackle the technicalities involved in mastering the
more advanced techniques.
Section2.1 introduces the axioms of linear spaces in full generality, establishes
basic properties and explores examples, most of which will be revisited throughout
the book. Section 2.2 is concerned with establishing the notion of dimension for an
arbitrary linear space. In particular, the dimension need not be ﬁnite, which, at times,
necessitates some more intricate proofs. Section 2.3 discusses linear operators, the
natural choice of structure preserving functions between linear spaces, studies their
basic properties, and discusses the notion of isomorphic linear spaces. Section 2.4
introduces standard constructions producing new spaces from given ones, and in
particular the kernel and image of a linear operator are discussed. The ﬁnal section
is devoted to inner product spaces and normed spaces and presents several important
examples such as function spaces and ℓp spaces.
2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
In R2, the scalar product α · x is between a real number α ∈R and a vector x ∈R2,
and yields again a vector in R2. However, in similar situations, such as in C2, the
scalar multiplication α · x is now deﬁned between any complex number α ∈C and
an arbitrary vector x. The most general situation is when α is allowed to vary over
the elements of an arbitrary (but ﬁxed) ﬁeld K. Prominent examples of ﬁelds are the
ﬁeld R of real numbers and the ﬁeld C of complex numbers (for a more detailed
discussion of ﬁelds the reader is referred to Sect.1.2.19 of the Preliminaries). The
deﬁnition of linear space given below is the result of a distillation of certain key
properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication in R2 or R3, and is formalized
in the most general form, namely with arbitrary ﬁelds. If the reader is not familiar
with any ﬁelds other than R or C (or Q, the ﬁeld of rational numbers), then it is
perfectly safe to proceed and replace any occurrence of an arbitrary ﬁeld K by either
R or C. In the context of this book these are in any case the most important ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Linear Space) Let K be an arbitrary ﬁeld (such as the ﬁeld of real
numbers or of complex numbers, for concrete examples). A set V of elements
x, y, z, . . . of an arbitrary nature, together with an operation, called vector addi-
tion, or simply addition, associating with any two elements x, y ∈V an element
z ∈V , called the sum of x and y, and denoted by z = x + y, as well as an operation
associating with any x ∈V and α ∈K an element w ∈V , called the product or
scalar product of α and x, and denoted by w = α · x, is called a linear space if
1. For all x, y, z ∈V , the operation of vector addition satisﬁes:
• Associativity, i.e., (x + y) + z = x + (y + z).

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
25
• Commutativity, i.e., x + y = y + x.
• Existence of a neutral element, i.e., there exists an element 0 ∈V , for which
x + 0 = x = 0 + x.
• Existence of additive inverses, i.e., there exists an element x′ ∈V such that
x + x′ = 0 = x′ + x.
2. For all x ∈V and α, β ∈K, the scalar product operation satisﬁes:
• Associativity, i.e., α · (β · x) = (αβ) · x.
• Neutrality of 1 ∈K, i.e., 1 · x = x.
3. For all x, y ∈V and α, β ∈K, the scalar product and vector addition operations
are compatible in the sense that
• Scalar product distributes over vector addition
α · (x + y) = α · x + α · y.
• Scalar product distributes over scalar addition
(α + β) · x = α · x + β · x.
A linear space is also called a vector space, its elements are called vectors, and the
elements of the ﬁeld K are called scalars. If we wish to emphasize the relevant ﬁeld,
then we say that V is a linear space over K. Otherwise, the assertion that V is a
linear space includes the implicit introduction of a ﬁeld K serving as the ﬁeld of
scalars for V .
Scalars will typically be denoted by lower-case Greek letters from the beginning
of the alphabet, namely α, β, γ, and so on, while vectors will be denoted by x, y, z,
etc. In either case, subscripts or superscripts may be used to enhance readability.
2.1.1 Elementary Properties of Linear Spaces
We now turn to establish several properties of linear spaces that immediately follow
from the axioms.
Proposition 2.1 In any linear space V the following statements hold.
1. The neutral element 0 ∈V is unique.
2. For all x ∈V , the additive inverse x′ is unique.
3. For all α ∈K and x ∈V , the equation α · x = 0 holds if, and only if, α = 0 or
x = 0.

26

Linear Spaces
Proof
1. Suppose that 0′ ∈V is a neutral element. That is
x + 0′ = x
for all x ∈V , and thus
0 = 0 + 0′ = 0′ + 0 = 0′.
2. Suppose that x′′ ∈V satisﬁes that x + x′′ = 0, then
x′ = x′ + 0 = x′ + (x + x′′) = (x′ + x) + x′′ = 0 + x′′ = x′′.
3. For α = 0
α · x = 0 · x = (0 + 0) · x = 0 · x + 0 · x =⇒0 · x = 0.
For x = 0
α · x = α · 0 = α · (0 + 0) = α · 0 + α · 0 =⇒α · 0 = 0.
In the other direction, if α · x = 0 and α ̸= 0, then upon multiplication by α−1,
one obtains
x = 1 · x = (α−1 · α) · x = α−1 · (α · x) = α−1 · 0 = 0.
□
Remark 2.1 It similarly follows that for any vector x, the additive inverse x′ is given
by x′ = (−1) · x. It is further common to neglect the · denoting the scalar product,
write x′ = −x and resort to the familiar conventions for algebraic manipulations on
vectors and scalars commonly used for addition and multiplication, e.g., we write
x −y for x + (−y) or x + y + z for (x + y) + z, and so on. This convention, of
course, considerably shortens proofs such as those given above and will be silently
used throughout the text below.
Remark 2.2 Most of the linear spaces we shall be concerned with will be over the
ﬁeld R of real numbers, in which case they are called real linear spaces, or over the
ﬁeld C of complex numbers, in which case they are called complex linear spaces.
In the absence of further speciﬁcation, or as implied by context, a linear space is
assumed to be either a real or a complex linear space.
Remark 2.3 We make no notational distinction between the zero vector, i.e., the
neutral element with respect to vector addition, and the element 0 in the ﬁeld K.
This is a generally safe practice, since context typically immediately points to the

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
27
correct interpretation. For instance, in the equation 0 · x = 0, context dictates that
the 0 on the left-hand-side is the scalar 0 ∈K while on the right-hand-side it is the
zero vector 0 ∈V .
2.1.2 Examples of Linear Spaces
Since linear spaces are very common in mathematics, presenting an exhaustive list
of linear spaces is a daunting task. The chosen examples below are meant to present
some commonly occurring linear spaces, to explore some less common possibilities,
and to familiarize the reader with some linear spaces of great importance in the
context of this book. The latter refers to linear spaces of sequences and of functions,
linear spaces that will be revisited throughout the rest of the text.
Example 2.1 In the familiar spaces R2 and R3, which are the mathematical models
of the physical plane and space, vector addition has the geometric interpretation
known as the parallelogram law, while scalar multiplication αx has a scaling effect
on the vector x determined by the magnitude and sign of α.
Example 2.2 Given a natural number n ≥1, let Rn be the set of n-tuples of real
numbers. Thus if x ∈Rn, then it is of the form x = (x1, . . . , xn) where (for every
1 ≤k ≤n) xk, the k-th component of x, is a real number.
For all x, y ∈Rn and α ∈R deﬁning
x + y = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . . , xn + yn)
αx = (αx1, αx2, . . . , αxn),
endows Rn with the structure of a linear space over the ﬁeld R, as is easy to verify.
Obviously, the cases n = 2 and n = 3 recover the familiar linear spaces R2 and
R3 (respectively). Analogously, the set Cn of all n-tuples of complex numbers, with
similar coordinate-wise operations, is a linear space over the ﬁeld C.
Example 2.3 Let R∞be the set of inﬁnite sequences of real numbers. Thus, a typical
element x ∈R∞is of the form x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk, . . .) where xk ∈R, for each
k ≥1, is a real number, the k-th component of x. For all x, y ∈R∞and α ∈R
setting
x + y = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2, . . . , xk + yk, . . .)
αx = (αx1, αx2, . . . , αxk, . . .)
endows R∞with the structure of a linear space over the ﬁeld R, as is easily seen.
Similarly, the set C∞of all inﬁnite sequences of complex numbers, with similar
coordinate-wise operations, is a linear space over the ﬁeld C.

28

Linear Spaces
Remark 2.4 The convention that for an element x in either Rn, Cn, R∞, or C∞its
k-th component is denoted by xk (as illustrated in the preceding examples) will be
used throughout this text. To refer to a sequence of such vectors we may thus use
super scripts for the different vectors, e.g., {x(m)}m≥1, and then x(m)
k
refers to the
k-th component of the m-th vector.
Example 2.4 Consider the subset c ⊆C∞consisting of all convergent sequences
(here convergence is in the usual sense of convergence of sequences of complex
numbers), let c0 ⊆c be the subset consisting of all sequences that converge to 0, and
let c00 ⊆c0 be the set
c00 = {(x1, . . . , xm, 0, 0, 0, . . .) | m ≥1,
x1, . . . , xm ∈C}
of all sequences that are eventually 0. With the same deﬁnition of addition and
multiplication as in Example 2.3, each of these sets is easily seen to be a linear space
over C. Obviously, replacing C throughout by R yields similar linear spaces over R.
Example 2.5 The constructions given above of the linear spaces Rn, Cn, R∞, and
C∞easily generalize to any ﬁeld K and to any cardinality. Indeed, consider an
arbitrary set B and an arbitrary ﬁeld K. Recall from the Preliminaries (Sect.1.2.8)
that the set K B is the set of all functions x : B →K. For all such functions
x : B →K,
y : B →K
and
α ∈K
deﬁne the functions x + y : B →K and αx : B →K by
(x + y)(b) = x(b) + y(b),
(αx)(b) = α · x(b).
With these notions of addition and scalar multiplication, the set K B is easily seen to
be a linear space over K. In particular, we obtain the linear spaces R{1,2,...,n} = Rn,
C{1,2,...,n} = Cn, RN = R∞, and CN = C∞. Further, restricting attention to the
subset (K B)0 consisting only of those functions x : B →K for which x(b) = 0 for
all but ﬁnitely many b ∈B also yields a linear space, with exactly the same deﬁnition
for addition and scalar multiplication as in K B. In particular the linear space c00
from Example 2.4 is recovered by noticing that c00 = (CN)0. Note however that for
a general ﬁeld K no analogue of the linear spaces c or c0 need exist since K need
not have any notion of convergence.
Example 2.6 For n ≥0, let Pn be the set of all polynomial functions, that is functions
of the form p(t) = antn + · · · + a1t + a0, with real coefﬁcients and degree at most
n. With the ordinary operations
(p + q)(t) = p(t) + q(t),
(αp)(t) = α · p(t)

2.1 Linear Spaces—Elementary Properties and Examples
29
taken as addition and scalar multiplication, it is immediate to verify that Pn is a
linear space over R. Removing the restriction on the degrees of the polynomials one
obtains the set P of all polynomial functions with real coefﬁcients which, again with
the obvious notions of addition and scalar multiplication, forms a linear space over
R. One may also consider polynomials with coefﬁcients in the ﬁeld C of complex
numbers, and obtain similar linear spaces over C.
Example 2.7 Let I be a subset of R which is either an open interval (a, b), a closed
interval [a, b], or the entire real line R. Consider the set C(I, R) of all continuous
real-valued functions x : I →R. The familiar deﬁnitions
(x + y)(t) = x(t) + y(t),
(αx)(t) = α · x(t),
when applied to continuous functions x, y : I →R, are well-known to give con-
tinuous functions again, and it is easy to see that when these operations are taken as
addition and scalar multiplication, the set C(I, R) is a linear space over R. One may
also consider the set C(I, C) of all continuous complex-valued functions x : I →C
to similarly obtain a linear space over C. One may also consider, for each k ≥1, the
set Ck(I, R) of all functions x : I →R with a continuous k-th derivative, which is
similarly a linear space over R. It is then customary to equate C0(I, R) with C(I, R).
We may also allow k = ∞so as to obtain C∞(I, R), the linear space of all inﬁnitely
differentiable functions.
Example 2.8 Let K be any ﬁeld and F a proper subﬁeld of K, namely F is a proper
subset of K, and with the induced operations from K it is itself a ﬁeld. For instance,
Q is a subﬁeld of R which in turn is a subﬁeld of C. In such a situation any linear
space V over the larger ﬁeld K is also a different linear space over the smaller ﬁeld F.
The reason is that, of course, the additive structure of V is unaffected by the choice
of ﬁeld of scalars, whereas the axioms relating to the scalar product, if they hold for
scalars ranging over K, then they certainly hold for scalars ranging over F (since all
scalar axioms are universal equational quantiﬁcations). The process of considering
a linear space over K as a linear space over F is named restriction of scalars.
In particular, each of the examples above of a linear space over C is also a linear
space over R, and also a linear space over Q. Any linear space obtained by restriction
of scalars F ⊂K is (except for trivial cases) very different than the original space.
Another particular instance of restriction of scalars is the observation that since R is
a linear space over itself (if this is confusing pause for a minute to realize that this is
essentially the assertion that R1 is a linear space), restriction of scalars implies that
R is also a linear space over Q.

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
31
2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
The familiar linear spaces Rn are all inﬁnite sets (in fact, they all have the same
cardinality, the cardinality c of the continuum). However, it is intuitively clear that
R3 is considerably ‘larger’ than, say, R2. This fact is usually expressed in the claim
that R3 has dimension 3, while R2 has dimension 2. The notion of dimension in
general linear spaces is rather subtle, especially for the inﬁnite dimensional ones.
We now attend to investigate this situation in full generality, starting with the related
concepts of linear independence and spanning sets.
2.2.1 Linear Independence, Spanning Sets, and Bases
By forming linear combinations of vectors from any given set of vectors in a linear
space, one obtains a (potentially) large collection of vectors. The original set is said
to be linearly independent if, intuitively, it does not allow for any redundancies when
forming linear combinations while it is a spanning set if it is sufﬁciently large to
generate any vector as a linear combination. The precise deﬁnitions follow.
Deﬁnition 2.2 Given any set S ⊆V of vectors in a linear space V (S may be ﬁnite
or inﬁnite), a linear combination of elements of S is any vector of the form
x =
m

k=1
αkxk
with x1, . . . , xm vectors from S and α1, . . . , αm ∈K arbitrary scalars. Equivalently,
x =

s∈S
αs · s
with αs = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many s ∈S. The two forms are essentially the same,
differing only notationally. The span of S is then the set of all linear combinations
of elements from S, and S is said to be a spanning set if its span is the entire linear
space V . A spanning set S is a minimal spanning set if it is itself a spanning set
but no proper subset of it is a spanning set. Further, S is said to be a set of linearly
independent vectors if the only possibility of expressing the zero vector as a linear
combination of elements from S is the trivial linear combination, i.e., where all the
coefﬁcients are 0. That is, S is linearly independent if whenever one has
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk,

32
2
Linear Spaces
with x1, . . . , xm vectors in S, then necessarily αk = 0 for all 1 ≤k ≤m. The set S
is said to be a maximal linearly independent set if it is itself linearly independent but
any set that properly contains it is not linearly independent. A set that is not linearly
independent is also referred to as a linearly dependent set. Finally, a set that is both
a spanning set and is linearly independent is said to be a basis of the linear space.
Remark 2.5 We speak of vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈V as being either spanning or linearly
independent, if the set {x1, . . . , xm} is spanning or linearly independent. Of course,
we may also consider countably inﬁnitely many vectors x1, x2, . . . as being spanning
or linearly independent, in a similar fashion.
Example 2.9 The situation in Rn is probably very familiar to the reader. Any m
vectors x1, . . . , xm in Rn are linearly independent if, and only if, the equation
m

k=1
αkxk = 0
admits the unique solution α1 = α2 = · · · = αm = 0. It is well-known that linear
independence implies m ≤n. Similarly, the given vectors are spanning if, and only
if, for every vector b ∈Rn the equation
m

k=1
αkxk = b
admits a solution. It is again a familiar fact that if the given vectors are spanning,
then m ≥n. It thus follows that a basis for Rn must consist of precisely n vectors.
In particular, all bases have the same size, namely n, which is referred to as the
dimension of Rn. Below we prove that every linear space has a dimension, if we
allow inﬁnite cardinalities into the picture. The result in that generality subsumes the
properties of Rn just mentioned.
Example 2.10 In the space C2, considered as a linear space over C, the vectors (1, 0)
and (0, 1) are immediately seen to form a basis. However, if C2 is considered as a
linear space over R (by the procedure of restriction of scalars from Example 2.8),
then these two vectors are (of course) still linearly independent but they fail to span
C2. Indeed, since only real scalars may now be used to form linear combinations of
these vectors, the span will only be R2. To obtain a basis, the two vectors need to be
augmented, for instance, by the vectors (i, 0) and (0, i). The four vectors together
do form a basis of C2.
Example 2.11 In the linear space Rn or Cn, the vectors x1, . . . , xn where
xk = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0)

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
33
with 1 in the k-th position, are easily seen to be spanning and linearly independent,
and thus form a basis, called the standard basis of Rn, respectively Cn. It is obvious
that Rn and Cn have inﬁnitely many bases.
In the examples presented so far it was quite straightforward to obtain a basis. The
following example shows that this is not always the case. In fact, it is not even clear
that the next linear space even has a basis.
Example 2.12 Let C∞be the linear space from Example 2.3. The vectors x1, x2, . . .,
given by
xk = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .)
with 1 in the k-th position are easily seen to be linearly independent, but they do
not form a spanning set. Indeed, since the span consists only of the ﬁnite linear
combinations of vectors from the set, the span in this case is the set of all vectors of
the form (a1, . . . , ak, 0, . . . , 0, 0, . . .), namely those inﬁnite sequences of complex
numbers that are eventually 0. In other words, the span in C∞of the vectors x1, x2, . . .
is the space c00 from Example 2.4, and thus we incidentally found a basis for c00.
It is now tempting to proceed as follows. Taking any vector y1 ∈R∞which is not
spanned by x1, x2, . . ., for instance the vector y1 = (1, 1, 1, . . . , 1, . . .), forming the
set {y1, x1, x2, . . .} must get us closer to obtaining a basis. Indeed, the new set is still
linearly independent precisely because y1 was not spanned by the rest of the vectors.
But, this new set is still not a basis as there are still many vectors it fails to span, for
instance the vector y2 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, . . .). Of course, we may now consider the
larger set {y1, y2, x1, x2, . . .}, but it too fails to be a basis. One may attempt to resolve
the argument once and for all by claiming that proceeding in this way to inﬁnity will
eventually result in a basis. However, this is a very vague statement, and even if this
process can be carried out mathematically (which it can, as will be shown below), it
is entirely unclear as to which vectors will end up in the basis and which will not. In
other words, even if this linear space has a basis, it is unlikely we can ever present
one.
Naturally, similar observations hold true for R∞instead of C∞, and in fact to
most of the linear spaces in this book, and in analysis in general.
Example 2.13 Recall (see Example 2.8) that one can consider the space R as a
linear space over the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers (as a particular case of restriction
of scalars). A real number α is said to be transcendental if it is not the root of a
polynomial with rational coefﬁcients. Examples of transcendental numbers include
e and π, though the proofs are far from trivial. For any transcendental number x
the set {1, x, x2, x3, . . .} is linearly independent (this is basically the deﬁnition of x
being transcendental), but it is not a spanning set.
Example 2.14 Recall the space Pn from Example 2.6 of all polynomial functions
with real coefﬁcients of degree at most n. For every k ≥0 let pk be the vector
pk(t) = tk. Clearly, the vectors p0, p1, p2, . . . , pn form a basis for Pn, but again
there are inﬁnitely many other choices of bases. The space P of all polynomial

34
2
Linear Spaces
functions with real coefﬁcients has a countable basis given by p0, p1, p2, . . ., a fact
that is easily veriﬁed. Noticing that polynomials are continuous functions, no matter
on which interval they are deﬁned, we see by the above that in the linear space C(I, R)
of all continuous functions x : I →R, where I is a non-degenerate interval (i.e., not
reducing to a point) the vectors p0, p1, p2, . . . are linearly independent. However,
they do not form a basis since any linear combination of these vectors is again
a polynomial function, but not all continuous functions are polynomial functions.
Once more, it is not at all clear that C(I, R) even has a basis (what would one look
like?).
From the discussion above we see that in some linear spaces, such as Rn, Pn, or
P, it is quite easy to ﬁnd bases while in other linear spaces, such as R∞, R over Q, or
C(I, R), it is a highly non-trivial task. In more detail, we saw that it is rather simple
to exhibit a large set of linearly independent vectors, but it is not so easy to have
these vectors also span the entire space (the spaces c00 and P, as discussed above,
are the exception to the rule). In fact, it is not at all clear that one can ﬁnd bases for
V in the case of R∞or C∞, as well as for R as a linear space over Q, or for C(I, R).
2.2.2 Existence of Bases
In order to establish that every linear space does have a basis, we observe some
immediate facts. It should be noted at once that the existence proof uses Zorn’s
Lemma in an essential way. That is, it can be shown that if every linear space has
a basis, then the Axiom of Choice holds. Consequently, the existence proof is not
constructive.
Proposition 2.2 Let S ⊆V be a set of vectors in a linear space V . The following
conditions are equivalent.
1. S is a maximal linearly independent set.
2. S is a minimal spanning set.
3. S is a basis.
Proof First we show that if S is a maximal linearly independent set, then it is a basis.
All that is needed is to show that S is a spanning set. To that end, let x ∈V be a
vector in the ambient linear space. If x ∈S, then it is certainly spanned by S. If
x /∈S, then by virtue of S being a maximal linearly independent set, the set S ∪{x}
is linearly dependent. Thus, there exist vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈S ∪{x} and non-zero
scalars α1, . . . , αm ∈K with
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk.
However, in the expression above it must be that x itself appears as a summand since
otherwise we would have expressed 0 as a non-trivial linear combination of vectors
from the linearly independent set S. We may thus isolate x in the expression above to

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
35
obtain it as a linear combination of elements from S. As x was arbitrary, we conclude
that S is a spanning set.
Next we show that if S is a minimal spanning set, then it is a basis. All that
is needed is to show that S is linearly independent, and indeed, if it were linearly
dependent, then we would have some expression as above, giving 0 as a non-trivial
linear combination of vectors from S. Using that expression we are able to isolate
some vector x ∈S and exhibit it as a linear combination of other vectors from S.
It is then easy to see that S −{x} is still a spanning set (simply since any linear
combination containing x can be replaced by one that does not). But this contradicts
S being a minimal spanning set, and thus S must be linearly independent.
So far we have shown that each of conditions 1 and 2 implies condition 3. The
proof will be completed by showing the converse of these implications. The details
are very similar in spirit to those given so far, and thus the rest of the proof is left for
the reader.
□
We are now ready to establish that every linear space has a basis. The proof
makes essential use of Zorn’s Lemma (see Sect.1.2.17 of the Preliminaries) and the
reader may safely choose to skip the proof on a ﬁrst reading. To the reader interested
in the technique of Zorn’s Lemma we remark that the proof below is actually a
straightforward application with little technical difﬁculties, and is thus a fortunate
ﬁrst encounter with this important proof technique.
Theorem 2.1 Every linearly independent set A ⊆V in a linear space V can be
extended to a maximal linearly independent set. In particular, by considering the
linearly independent set ∅⊆V and by Proposition 2.2, it follows that every linear
space V has a basis.
Proof Consider the set P of all linearly independent subsets S of V that contain
A, which we order by set inclusion. Evidently P is a poset, and to ﬁnd a maximal
linearly independent set that extends A amounts to ﬁnding a maximal element in P,
and so we apply Zorn’s Lemma (Sect.1.2.17 of the Preliminaries). First we note that
P is certainly not empty since clearly A ∈P. Now, assume that {Si}i∈I is a chain in
P. We will show that S = 
i∈I Si is an upper bound for the chain. Clearly Si ⊆S
for all i ∈I, thus the only thing to show is that S ∈P, namely that S contains A
(which is immediate) and that it is linearly independent. For that, assume that
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk
is a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈S. Since S is the union
of the Si, it follows that xm ∈S f (m) for a suitable f (m) ∈I, but since {Si}i∈I is a
chain it follows that there is a single index i0 ∈I such that x1, . . . , xm ∈Si0. But
then the equality above expresses the zero vector as a non-trivial linear combination
of vectors from Si0, contradicting the fact that Si0 is linearly independent. With that
the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma are satisﬁed, and so the existence of a maximal

36
2
Linear Spaces
element in P is guaranteed. This maximal element is a set SM ∈P, namely SM
contains A and SM is a maximal set of linearly independent vectors, as required. □
2.2.3 Existence of Dimension
Now that we know that every linear space has at least one basis, it is tempting to
deﬁne the dimension of a linear space to be the cardinality of its basis. However,
for this to make sense we need to know that all bases have the same cardinality.
While this is a very plausible assertion (certainly for such familiar spaces as Rn), it
requires a careful proof, particularly in the inﬁnite dimensional case. The important
ingredient is the following lemma, which states that the cardinality of any linearly
independent set is not greater than the cardinality of any spanning set. This result
again uses Zorn’s Lemma and its proof may safely be skipped on a ﬁrst reading. A
word of caution to the ambitious reader that this proof, compared to the proof of
Theorem 2.1, is technically more demanding.
Lemma 2.1 If V is a linear space, I ⊆V a linearly independent set of vectors, and
S ⊆V a spanning set, then there exists an injective function f : I →S.
Proof Consider a pair (J, f ) where J ⊆I and f : J →S is an injection. The
idea will be (using Zorn’s Lemma) to keep on extending the domain of f until the
entire set I is exhausted. An important ingredient for achieving that is the following.
Thinking of the injective function f : J →S as an instruction to replace the vectors
in J by their images in S, we only consider such pairs (J, f ) for which (I −J)∪f (J)
is still a linearly independent set. Let us now form the set P of all such pairs and
introduce an ordering on it declaring that (J1, f1) ≤(J2, f2) precisely when J1 ⊆J2
and f2 extends f1 (the latter means that f1(x) = f2(x) holds for all x ∈J1). It is
immediate that P is a poset, and that a maximal element in it will furnish us with an
injective function f : JM →S for a very large subset JM ⊆I. We will then show
that necessarily JM = I, and the result will be established.
To verify the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma, notice ﬁrst that P is not empty. Indeed,
the pair (∅, ∅) is in P. Next, let {(Jt, ft)}t∈T be a chain in P, for which we must now
ﬁnd an upper bound. Let
J =

t∈T
Jt
and notice that we may deﬁne f : J →S as follows. Given x ∈J there is some
t ∈T such that x ∈Jt, and so let f (x) = ft(x). To see that this is a well-deﬁned
function, i.e., that it is independent of the choice of t ∈T , note that if x ∈Jt′, then
either Jt ⊆Jt′ or Jt′ ⊆Jt and then either ft′ extends ft or ft extends ft′, and in either
case ft(x) = ft′(x). It is clear that Jt ⊆J and that f extends ft, for all t ∈T , so all
we need to do in order to show that (J, f ) is an upper bound for the chain is establish
that (J, f ) ∈P. Clearly, J ⊆I, and f : J →S is injective (since we saw that in

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
37
fact for any two x1, x2 ∈J the function f agrees with some ft, which is injective, so
f (x1) = f (x2) =⇒ft(x1) = ft(x2) =⇒x1 = x2). So it remains to observe that
(I −J) ∪f (J) is a linearly independent set of vectors. Indeed, if 0 can be obtained
as a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈(I −J)∪f (J), then,
using the chain condition again, it follows that there exists an element t ∈T such
that x1, . . . , xm ∈(I −Jt) ∪ft(Jt), which is a linearly independent set, yielding a
contradiction.
With the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma now veriﬁed, it follows that there exists
a maximal element (JM, fM), with JM ⊆I and fM : JM →S an injection. If
JM = I, then we are done, since fM : I →S is the required injection. Assuming
this is not the case, let x! ∈I −JM. If we can ﬁnd a vector y! ∈S−fM(JM) such that
(I −(JM ∪{x!})) ∪( fM(JM) ∪{y!})
is linearly independent, then we will have that (JM ∪{x!}, f!) ∈P, where f! is the
extension of fM given by f!(x!) = y!. But that would contradict the maximality of
(JM, fM), and we will have our contradiction. So, we proceed to prove the existence
of such a vector y!. If no such y! exists, then that means that the set
(I −(JM ∪{x!})) ∪( fM(JM) ∪{y})
is a linearly dependent set for every y ∈S −fM(JM). Now, since S is a spanning
set we may write
x! =

s∈S
αs · s =

s∈fM(JM)
αs · s +

s∈S−fM(JM)
αs · s = x1 + x2
where the sum is a ﬁnite sum, so that αs = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many s, and we simply
split the sum according to whether or not s ∈fM(JM). By our assumption, the set
(I −(JM ∪{x!})) ∪fM(JM)
is linearly dependent if any of the vectors s ∈S −fM(JM) is added to it. Thus,
this set is linearly dependent if any linear combination of such vectors, such as x2,
is added to it. Further, since x1 is in the span of fM(JM) it follows that the set above
is linearly dependent if x = x1 + x2 is added to it. But the latter is the set
(I −(JM ∪{x!})) ∪fM(JM) ∪{x!} = (I −JM) ∪fM(JM)
which is linearly independent. The proof is now complete.
□
We are now in position to establish the following important result.
Theorem 2.2 Let V be a linear space. If B1 and B2 are any two bases for V , then
they have the same cardinality.

38
2
Linear Spaces
Proof By deﬁnition of basis, B1 is linearly independent and B2 is a spanning set.
By Lemma 2.1, there is an injective function f : B1 →B2. By the same argument
there is also an injective function g : B2 →B1. It now follows from the Cantor-
Schröder-Bernstein theorem (Theorem 1.1 in the Preliminaries) that the cardinalities
of B1 and B2 are equal.
□
Deﬁnition 2.3 The dimension of a linear space V , indicated by dim(V ), is equal to
the cardinality of a basis for it. Notice that by Theorem2.1, at least one basis exists,
and by Theorem2.2 all bases have the same cardinality. Thus, the notion of dimension
is well-deﬁned. The linear space V is said to be ﬁnite dimensional if its dimension is
ﬁnite, and inﬁnite dimensional otherwise. A basis for an inﬁnite dimensional linear
space is also referred to as a Hamel basis.
Example 2.15 Finite dimensional linear spaces, by Examples2.11 and 2.14, include
the spaces Rn and Cn, having dimension n, and the space Pn of polynomials (see
Example2.6), which is of dimension n+1. Inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces include,
due to Examples2.12 and 2.14, the space c00 of sequences that are eventually 0, the
space P of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients, and the space C(I, R) of continuous
function x : I →R, as long as I does not reduce to a point.
We have already encountered linear spaces of very large dimension. To argue
about the dimension of such spaces (and in general) the following result, interesting
on its own, is useful. Recall from Example 2.5 the linear space (K B)0 of all functions
x : B →K satisfying x(b) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many b ∈B.
Proposition 2.3 Let V be a linear space and B a basis for it. Then every vector
x ∈V can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of elements from B. In
other words, there is a bijective correspondence between the vectors x ∈V and the
elements of (K B)0.
Proof Since a typical element in (K B)0 is nothing but a function x : B →K for
which x(b) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many b ∈B, we may associate with each such x the
vector 
b∈B x(b)·b (as the summation is ﬁnite). We claim that this correspondence
is the desired bijection. Indeed, it is a tautology that the surjectivity of this process
is precisely the claim that B is a spanning set, while it is almost a tautology that the
injectivity of the process is the claim that B is linearly independent.
□
We thus see that a basis B endows a linear space with a notion of coordinates.
This is certainly a useful thing to have, but for practical reasons it is only as useful as
the ability to explicitly describe the basis B. In ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces it is
very common to work with bases but, as we remarked earlier, in inﬁnite dimensional
linear spaces being able to explicitly describe a basis is the exception rather than the
rule. Consequently, Hamel bases in inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces are generally
used for theoretical rather than practical purposes.
Example 2.16 Recall from Example 2.8 that R may be viewed as a linear space over
Q. Suppose that B is a Hamel basis for R over Q. By Proposition 2.3, there is then

2.2 The Dimension of a Linear Space
39
a bijection between R and the set (QB)0 of all functions B →Q which attain 0
at all but ﬁnitely many arguments. In other words, |R| = |(QB)0| (see Sect.1.2.11
of the Preliminaries for the basics of cardinalities). If B is countable, then it is
easy to write (QB)0 as a countable union of countable sets (refer to Sect.1.2.13
from the Preliminaries for the relevant material) and thus the set (QB)0 itself would
be countable. But that would imply that R is a countable set while the reals are
well-known to be uncountable. We conclude that R, as a linear space over Q, is
inﬁnite dimensional of uncountable dimension.
We close this section by illustrating a difference between ﬁnite dimensional linear
spaces and inﬁnite dimensional ones.
Proposition 2.4 The cardinality of any linearly independent set A in a linear space
V is a lower bound for the dimension of V . Moreover, if V is ﬁnite dimensional, then
any linearly independent set A ⊆V whose cardinality is equal to the dimension of
V is a basis.
Proof The dimension of V is the cardinality of any basis B, and as B is in particular
a spanning set, it follows from Lemma 2.1 that there is an injection A →B, and
so the cardinalities satisfy |A| ≤|B| (refer to Sect.1.2.11 of the Preliminaries, if
needed). The claim now follows since the latter is the dimension of V .
Now, if V is ﬁnite dimensional, say of dimension n, and A = {x1, . . . , xn} is
a set of n linearly independent vectors, then to show A is a basis we just need to
prove that it is a spanning set. But if it were not, and y ∈V is any vector not in its
span, then the set {x1, . . . , xn, y} is linearly independent and contains n + 1 vectors.
But then, by the ﬁrst part of the proposition, it would follow that n + 1 ≤n, an
absurdity.
□
Remark 2.6 The ﬁnite dimensionality assumption is crucial. For instance, in the
linear space c00 of sequences which are eventually 0 (Example 2.4), consider the
vectors {xk}k≥1 where xk = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .), with 1 in the k-th position. These
vectors are easily seen to be linearly independent and spanning, thus they form a
basis of countably many vectors. The dimension of c00 is thus inﬁnitely countable.
The set {x2, x3, . . .} is clearly also linearly independent, has the same cardinality as
the dimension of c00, but it is not spanning, and thus not a basis.

2.3 Linear Operators
The deﬁnition and properties of the structure preserving functions between linear
spaces form the topic of this section. The deﬁnitions (including that of a linear
isomorphism) and the results are discussed and exempliﬁed in the context of the
linear spaces introduced above.
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let V and W be linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K. A function
T : V →W is said to be additive if
T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y)
for all vectors x, y ∈V , and it is said to be homogenous if
T (αx) = αT (x)
for all vectors x ∈V and all scalars α ∈K. If T is both additive and homogeneous,
then it is called a linear operator, a condition equivalent to the equality
T (α1x1 + α2x2) = α1T (x1) + α2T (x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈V and α1, α2 ∈K.
Remark 2.7 Synonymous terms for linear operator are linear transformation and
linear homomorphism. Throughout the book we will adopt the convention that any
reference to a linear operator T : V →W immediately implies, implicitly at times,
that V and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K.
It is a straightforward proof by induction that a linear operator T preserves any
linear combination, that is
T (
m

k=1
αkxk) =
m

k=1
αkT (xk)
for all scalars α1, . . . , αm ∈K and vectors x1, . . . , xm ∈V . In fact, this property
can equivalently be taken as the deﬁnition of linear operator. The next result shows
that the linearity requirement of a linear operator forces any linear operator to also
respect the zero vector, additive inverses, and subtraction.
Proposition 2.5 For a linear operator T : V →W:
1. T (0) = 0.
2. T (−x) = −T (x) for all x ∈V .
3. T (x −y) = T (x) −T (y) for all x, y ∈V .

42

Linear Spaces
Proof
1. Notice that T (0) + T (0) = T (0 + 0) = T (0), and now subtract T (0) from both
sides of the equation.
2. T (x) + T (−x) = T (x + (−x)) = T (0) = 0.
3. T (x −y) = T (x + (−y)) = T (x) + T (−y) = T (x) −T (y).
□
2.3.1 Examples of Linear Operators
Trivial, but important, examples of linear operators are the following. For any linear
space V , the identity function id : V →V is always a linear operator. On the other
extreme, given linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld, the function T0 : V →W
given by T0(x) = 0 is also immediately seen to be a linear operator.
In the presence of a basis for the domain V , linear operators T : V →W are
easily characterized by the following result, readily yielding an endless supply of
examples.
Lemma 2.2 Let V and W be linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K, and let B be a
basis for V . It then holds that any function F : B →W extends uniquely to a linear
operator TF : V →W.
Proof For a given function F : B →W, suppose that TF : V →W is a linear
operator extending F. Then, given any vector x ∈V , write
x =

b∈B
αb · b
as a (ﬁnite) linear combination of basis elements, and then it follows that
TF(x) = TF(

b∈B
αb · b) =

b∈B
αb · TF(b) =

b∈B
αb · F(b).
Noticing that the computation above expresses T (x) in terms of vectors of the form
F(b) we conclude that an extension TF, if it exists, is unique. If we now take the
equality above as a deﬁnition, then we obtain a function TF : V →W (relying on
the uniqueness of the linear combination expressing x in order to assure that TF is
well-deﬁned). Verifying that this TF is indeed a linear operator and that it extends F
follow immediately.
□
Remark 2.8 The linear operator TF : V →W constructed from the given function
F : B →W above is said to be obtained by linearly extending F to all of V .
Often enough the technique of the last result is inadequate, either because a basis
is not readily available or because a more direct formula for the linear operator is
obtainable. The following examples illustrate these possibilities.
Example 2.17 The derivation operation d/dt, taking a function f to its derivative
d f/dt, satisﬁes the well-known properties

2.3 Linear Operators
43
d
dt ( f + g) = d
dt ( f ) + d
dt (g)
and
d
dt (αf ) = α d
dt ( f ),
namely, it is additive and homogenous, and thus, if we choose the domain and
codomain correctly, we expect it to be a linear operator. To turn this observation
into a precise statement, recall the linear spaces Ck([a, b], R) from Example 2.7
of all functions x : [a, b] →R with a continuous k-th derivative. Then, for every
k ≥1, the observation above can be stated by saying that d/dt : Ck([a, b], R) →
Ck−1([a, b], R) is a linear operator. Similarly, d/dt : C∞([a, b], R) →C∞
([a, b], R) is a linear operator on the linear space of inﬁnitely differentiable functions.
Example 2.18 The integral operator
	 b
a dt f (t) is also well known to be additive and
homogenous, and, since every continuous function on a closed interval is integrable,
we obtain that for every interval I = [a, b] the function
f →
b

a
dt f (t)
is a linear operator from the linear space C(I, R) of Example 2.7 to R as a linear
space over itself.
Example 2.19 Spaces of inﬁnite sequences, such as R∞from Example 2.3 or the
space c0 from Example 2.4 admit the following operators (we use R∞just to ﬁx one
possibility). The shift operator S : R∞→R∞, given, for x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk . . .),
by S(x) = (x2, x3, . . . , xk, . . .), is easily seen to be a linear operator. It is equally
easy to see that the function T : R∞→R∞, given for x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk . . .)
as above by T (x) = (0, x1, x2, . . . , xk, . . .) is a linear operator. Note that S ◦T is
the identity while T ◦S is not, a phenomenon that is known to be impossible in
ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces. These operators are the creation and annihilation
operators a† and a, widely used in Quantum Mechanics.
We see thus that even when a basis can be given explicitly (and certainly when it
cannot) it may be much simpler to deﬁne a linear operator directly rather than by
linear extension on a basis.
2.3.2 Algebra of Operators
With suitable domain and codomain, linear operators can be composed or added. We
now investigate the resulting algebraic laws related to these operations.

44
2
Linear Spaces
Proposition 2.6 The composition S ◦T : U →W of any two linear operators
U
T
 V
S
 W (where in particular all linear spaces are over the same ﬁeld)
is a linear operator.
Proof The additivity of S ◦T follows from the deﬁnition of the composition and the
computation
S(T (x + y)) = S (T (x) + T (y)) = S (T (x)) + S (T (y)),
valid for all vectors x, y ∈U, utilizing the additivity of T and S. The homogeneity
of the composition follows similarly and the reader is invited to ﬁll in the details. □
Next, any two functions T, S : V →W between linear spaces over the ﬁeld K can
be added to give rise to the function T + S : V →W given by
(T + S)(x) = T (x) + S(x)
for all x ∈V . Further, given a scalar α ∈K, the function αT : V →W is given by
(αT )(x) = α (T (x)) .
Proposition 2.7 For all linear operators T, S : V →W and scalars α ∈K, both
T + S and αT are linear operators.
Proof For all vectors x, y ∈V and scalars β, γ ∈K:
(T + S)(βx + γ y) = T (βx + γ y) + S(βx + γ y)
= T (βx) + T (γ y) + S(βx) + S(γ y)
= βT (x) + γ T (y) + βS(x) + γ S(y)
= β(T (x) + S(x)) + γ (T (y) + S(y))
= β(T + S)(x) + γ (T + S)(y).
The proof for αT is similar and left for the reader.
□
The result above shows that the set of all linear operators T : V →W has naturally
deﬁned notions of addition and scalar multiplication. It is a pleasant fact that with
these operations one obtains a linear space.
Deﬁnition 2.5 Given linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K, we denote by
Hom(V, W) the set of all linear operators T : V →W.
Theorem 2.3 For linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K, the set Hom(V, W),
when endowed with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication as above,
is a linear space over K.

2.3 Linear Operators
45
Proof The proof is a straightforward veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms, so we
only give the details for a few of the axioms. For instance, given linear operators
T1, T2 : V →W, to show that
T1 + T2 = T2 + T1
we note that
(T1 + T2)(x) = T1(x) + T2(x) = T2(x) + T1(x) = (T2 + T1)(x)
where the commutativity of vector addition in W was used.
To show the existence of an additively neutral element, recall that T0 : V →W
given by T0(x) = 0, is always a linear operator, and thus T0 ∈Hom(V, W). Seeing
that T0 is additively neutral is simply the computation
(T + T0)(x) = T (x) + T0(x) = T (x) + 0 = T (x).
We leave the veriﬁcation of the other axioms to the reader.
□
2.3.3 Isomorphism
The linear spaces Rn+1 and Pn, while consisting of very different elements, are, in
a strong sense, essentially identical. It is obvious that one may think of a sequence
of n + 1 real numbers as the coefﬁcients of a polynomial, and, vice versa, one may
identify a polynomial function with its list of coefﬁcients and thus obtain n + 1 real
numbers. Thus, one may rename the elements in one space to obtain the elements of
the other, and, moreover, the linear structure under this renaming is respected. This
situation is made precise, and generalized, by the concept of isomorphism.
Deﬁnition 2.6 A linear operator T : V →W which, as a function, is a bijection
is called a linear isomorphism or (simply an isomorphism if the linear context is
clear). When T : V →W is an isomorphism, the spaces V and W are said to be
isomorphic, denoted by V ∼= W.
The following result establishes some expected behaviour of isomorphisms.
Proposition 2.8 Suppose that U, V , and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K
and consider the linear operators T : U →V and S : V →W. The following then
hold.
1. The identity function id : V →V is an isomorphism.
2. If T and S are isomorphisms, then so is S ◦T .
3. If T is an isomorphism, then so is the inverse function T −1.

46
2
Linear Spaces
Proof
1. We already noted that the identity function is always a linear operator. It is clearly
bijective and thus an isomorphism.
2. We already noted that the composition of linear operators is a linear operator, and
thus S ◦T is a linear operator. In general, the composition of bijective functions
is again bijective, and so if T and S are isomorphisms, then so is S ◦T .
3. Since T : U →V is an isomorphism, the inverse function T −1 : V →U exists,
and is clearly a bijection. To conclude the proof it remains to be shown that T −1
is a linear operator. Indeed, T −1 is additive since
T −1(x + y) = T −1(T (T −1(x)) + T (T −1(y)))
= T −1(T (T −1(x) + T −1(y)))
= T −1(x) + T −1(y)
for all vectors x, y ∈V . Further, T −1 is homogenous since
T −1(αx) = T −1(αT (T −1(x))) = T −1(T (αT −1(x))) = αT −1(x)
for all vectors x ∈V and scalars α ∈K.
□
Corollary 2.1 For all linear spaces U, V , and W over the same ﬁeld K:
1. V ∼= V .
2. If U ∼= V , then V ∼= U.
3. If U ∼= V and V ∼= W, then U ∼= W.
Isomorphic linear spaces are essentially identical, except (possibly) for the names
of the elements in them and they thus possess exactly the same linear properties.
This is a somewhat vague statement but it is almost always immediate how to turn
it into a precise statement. For instance, the dimension of a linear space is a linear
property and thus any two isomorphic linear spaces have the same dimension, as we
now show.
Proposition 2.9 If V ∼= W, then both linear spaces have the same dimension.
Proof By assumption there exists a linear isomorphism T : V →W. The dimension
of a linear space is the cardinality of any of its bases, and thus the result will be
established by exhibiting a bijection between a basis for V and a basis of W. Let
B ⊆V be a basis and consider its image T (B) ⊆W. Clearly, T |B, the restriction of
T to B, is a bijection between B and f (B), so all that remains to be done is to show
that f (B) is a basis for W, namely that f (B) is a spanning set of linearly independent
vectors. Let y ∈W be an arbitrary vector. Since T is onto, we may write y = T (x)
for some x ∈V . As B is a basis, we express x as a (ﬁnite!) linear combination of
basis elements:

2.3 Linear Operators
47
x =

b∈B
αb · b.
But then
y = T (x) =

b∈B
αb · T (b)
and thus y is in the span of T (B). As y was arbitrary we conclude that T (B) spans
all of W. The proof that T (B) is also linearly independent follows a similar pattern
and is left for the reader.
□
The converse to this result is also true, as the following result implies.
Theorem 2.4 If V is a linear space and B is a basis for it, then V ∼= (K B)0.
Proof In Proposition 2.3 we established that the function T : (K B)0 →V given by
T ( f ) =

b∈B
f (b) · b
is a bijection. We show now that it is in fact an isomorphism, thus completing the
proof. We need to verify that T (α1 f + α2g) = α1T ( f ) + α2T (g), which amounts
to showing that

b∈B
(α1 f + α2g)(b) · b = α1

b∈B
f (b) · b + α2

b∈B
g(b) · b,
which follows by an immediate computation.
□
Remark 2.9 Every linear space V over K is thus isomorphic to a linear space of the
form (K B)0. The latter space is clearly only dependent on the cardinality of the set
B, i.e., if X is any set with the same cardinality as B, then (K B)0 ∼= (K X)0. In other
words, the dimension of a linear space determines it up to an isomorphism. It should
be noted however that generally there is no canonical choice for an isomorphism
between V and (K X)0.
In the ﬁnite dimensional case we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 2.2 Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional linear space over the ﬁeld K. Any
choice of a basis x1, . . . , xn for V gives rise to an isomorphism V →K n. In this
way we may identify every vector in V , by means of coordinates, with an n-tuple of
scalars.
In a more general context, and in particular in the inﬁnite dimensional case, where
bases are typically not explicitly available, we have the following results.
Corollary 2.3 If V and W are linear spaces over the same ﬁeld K and they have
the same dimension, then they are isomorphic.

Linear Spaces
Proof By Remark 2.9, if we let X be a set of cardinality equal to the common
dimensions of V and W, then we obtain an isomorphisms T1 : (K X)0 →V and
an isomorphism T2 : (K X)0 →W. It follows that T2 ◦T −1
1
: V →W is an
isomorphism, showing that V ∼= W, as claimed.
□
Combining Proposition 2.9 and Corollary 2.3, the discussion above is summarized
as follows.
Theorem 2.5 Two linear spaces over the same ﬁeld are isomorphic if, and only if,
they have the same dimension.
Remark 2.10 This result is an example of what is known as a rigidity phenomenon.
Rigidity refers to a situation where two structures are essentially the same given
that they have essentially the same substructure of some kind, typically of a much
coarser nature than the original structures. In this case, the rigidity of linear spaces
over a ﬁxed ﬁeld K is that the dimension, i.e., the cardinality of a basis, sufﬁces to
determine the linear space, up to an isomorphism.
Example 2.20 Recall the linear space Pn of polynomial functions from Example
2.6. We can easily show that Pn ∼= Rn+1 by constructing an isomorphism between
the two spaces. Indeed, referring here to a typical element in Rn+1 by (a0, . . . , an),
let
T : Rn+1 →Pn
be given by
T (a0, . . . , an) = antn + · · · + a1t + a0.
It is a trivial matter to verify that T is a linear operator, clearly bijective, and thus an
isomorphism. Similarly, the reader is invited to show that c00 ∼= P. By the discussion
above, the existence of an isomorphism (but not any explicit isomorphism) could
have been deduced by noting that both Rn+1 and Pn, as linear spaces over R, have
dimension n + 1. Similarly, both c00 and P have countably inﬁnite dimension and
are thus isomorphic.
Remark 2.11 Theorem 2.5 tells us that the dimension of a linear space essentially
is all that one needs to know about a linear space in order to study it (since after
all, isomorphic linear spaces are essentially the same). It is thus tempting to, once
and for all, choose a single representative from each isomorphism class of linear
spaces. This certainly sufﬁces for the study of all linear spaces, and seems more
economical than having all of this redundancy in the form of multiple isomorphic
specimens of linear spaces. However, the example above clearly shows the danger
in this approach. While Rn+1 and Pn are isomorphic, they have different qualities
(at least to us humans). For instance, it is very natural to consider the integral as
an operator on polynomials, but not so much on elements in Rn+1. The richness of
having many different linear spaces, even if they are isomorphic, is a blessing that
should not be given up for the sake of a more economical treatment.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
Subspaces arise naturally as portions of a given linear space that inherit a linear space
structure from the ambient linear space. We show that any linear operator gives rise
to certain subspaces, its kernel and its image, and we show how to combine two
linear spaces to form their product space. We also show how to eliminate a subspace
so as to obtain a quotient space. The quotient construction is related to the concept
of complementary subspaces, which is also introduced and the connection made
explicit.
2.4.1 Subspaces
Given a subset A ⊆V of a linear space V the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication, when restricted to vectors in A always yield elements in the ambient
space V . We are interested in the case where the results of these operations always
yield elements in A.
Deﬁnition 2.7 A subset A ⊆V is said to be closed under addition if
x + y ∈A

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
51
for all vectors x, y ∈A. Similarly, A is said to be closed under scalar multiplication if
αx ∈A
for all vectors x ∈A and scalars α ∈K. The set A is called a linear subspace (or
simply subspace if the linear context is evident) of V if A ̸= ∅and A is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication. A subspace A is called a proper subspace if it is
properly contained in the ambient space V .
Remark 2.12 If A is a linear subspace of V , then A, with vector addition and scalar
multiplication induced from V , is a linear space. Indeed, the veriﬁcation of each of
the axioms follows the same pattern. For instance,
x + y = y + x
holds for all x, y ∈A since the same equality holds for all vectors x and y in the
ambient space V . Moreover, notice that the zero vector 0 is always an element in A
and is the zero vector of A. Indeed, 0 = 0 · x holds for all x ∈A, and since A is
required to be non-empty, at least one x ∈A exists.
Notice that the subset {0} consisting of just the zero vector is always a subspace,
called the trivial subspace of V . Another immediate example of a subspace of V is
V itself, i.e., a non-proper subspace. An immediate property of subspaces is their
transitive property, that is if A ⊆B ⊆V , then if B is a subspace of V and A is a
subspace of B, then A is a subspace of V .
Example 2.21 Consider the linear space R2 and its subset A consisting only of the
vectors of the form (x, 0) ∈R2. Clearly, A is non-empty, closed under addition, and
closed under scalar multiplication, and hence is a subspace of R2. More generally,
a line l = {tx | t ∈R}, with x ∈R2 a non-zero vector, is a linear subspace of
R2. These linear subspaces, together with the subspaces {0} and R2, exhaust all of
the linear subspaces of R2. Similarly, linear subspaces of Rn, for larger values of n,
correspond to the origin, to lines through the origin, to planes through the origin, and
to hyper-planes through the origin. Notice the following subtle point. The ﬁeld R,
when viewed as a linear space over itself, is obviously isomorphic to R1, that is to
Rn where n = 1. However, even though the linear space R ∼= R1 may naturally be
identiﬁed with either the X-axis or the Y-axis in R2, formally speaking, R itself (or
R1) is not a subspace of R2. In fact, it is not even a subset of R2. More generally, Rn
is a subspace of Rm if, and only if, n = m, in which case the two spaces coincide.
When n ≤m the space Rn may be identiﬁed in ﬁnitely many ways with various
subspaces of Rm, but that is a different story. An analogous discussion can be given
for linear spaces over C.
Example 2.22 Consider the linear space C∞from Example 2.3 and the linear spaces
c of convergent sequences, c0 of sequences that converge to 0, and c00 of sequences
that are eventually 0 (see Example 2.4). One clearly has that

52
2
Linear Spaces
c00 ⊂c0 ⊂c ⊂C∞
and in fact c00 is a linear subspace of c0, which in turn is a linear subspace of c,
which is a linear subspace of C∞. The veriﬁcation is immediate.
Other subspaces of C∞include, for each n ≥1, the set of all vectors of the form
(x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, . . .). This space is clearly isomorphic to Cn, as are inﬁnitely many
other subspaces of C∞, as the reader is asked to verify. In any event, Cn is not itself
a subspace of C∞.
Example 2.23 Consider the linear space Pn (Example 2.6) consisting of polynomial
functions with real coefﬁcients of degree not exceeding n, and P, the linear space
of all polynomials with real coefﬁcients. For all n ≤m, it holds that Pn ⊂Pm ⊂P,
and it follows easily that Pn is a subspace of Pm, which in turn is a subspace of P.
We thus obtain the tower of proper subspace inclusions
P0 ⊂P1 ⊂P2 ⊂· · · ⊂Pn ⊂· · · ⊂P.
Example 2.24 With reference to Example 2.7, the subset of C([a, b], R) consisting
of the continuous functions x : [a, b] →R which vanish at a and b, that is such that
x(a) = x(b) = 0, constitutes a linear subspace. On the contrary, the subset of those
continuous functions with x(a) = x(b) = 1 does not constitute a linear subspace
(for instance since it fails to contain the zero vector).
The following family of linear spaces, which are subspaces of C∞, is of signiﬁcant
importance.
Example 2.25 (The ℓp Spaces). Consider the linear space C∞from Example 2.3
and recall that a sequence x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) ∈C∞is said to be bounded if there
exists some M ∈R such that
|xk| < M
for all k ≥1. Let ℓ∞⊆C∞be the set of all bounded sequences. Clearly, the
zero vector, namely the constantly zero sequence, is in ℓ∞, the sum of two bounded
sequences is again bounded, and thus in ℓ∞, and if x is bounded by M, then αx =
(αx1, . . . , αxk, . . .) is bounded by |α|M, and thus is in ℓ∞. It thus follows that ℓ∞
is a linear subspace of C∞.
Now, let p ≥1 and consider the set ℓp of all sequences of complex numbers that
are absolutely p-power summable, that is, all sequences x ∈C∞such that
∞

k=1
|xk|p < ∞.
Clearly, the constantly zero sequence belongs to ℓp, and ℓp is evidently closed under
scalar multiplication. To show that ℓp is a subspace of C∞it thus remains to be
shown that ℓp is closed under addition, a task we leave to the reader.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
53
We thus obtain a one-parameter family {ℓp}1≤p≤∞of linear subspaces of C∞.
In fact, it is easily seen that if 1 ≤p < q ≤∞, then ℓp ⊂ℓq (consider a suitable
variation of the harmonic series), and so ℓp is a proper linear subspace of ℓq.
Example 2.26 Recall from Example 2.8 that R may be viewed as a linear space over
R, and that C can be viewed as a linear space over C or as a linear space over R.
The set inclusion R ⊆C is of course always valid, but R is a linear subspace of C
only when both are considered to be linear spaces over R (or over Q). A subspace
relation between two linear spaces can only hold if both linear spaces are over the
same ﬁeld, and so, for instance, Cn as a linear space over R is not a linear subspace
of Cn as a linear space over C.
We now address the relationship between subspaces and dimension which, in the
ﬁnite case, is as one would expect. But the inﬁnite case, as usual, is more subtle.
Theorem 2.6 For a linear space V of dimension n and a subspace U ⊆V with
dimension m, the following hold.
1. m ≤n.
2. If V is ﬁnite dimensional and m = n, then U = V .
Proof
1. The proof is given in full generality, thus n and m may be inﬁnite cardinals. Let
BV be a basis for V and let BU be a basis for U. By assumption, the cardinality
of BV is n while the cardinality of BU is m. Now, by deﬁnition of basis, BU is a
linearly independent set of vectors in U, and hence is also linearly independent
in V , while BV is a spanning set in V . Applying Lemma 2.1, it follows that there
exists an injection BU →BV , and thus n ≤m.
2. Assume now that m = n and that V is ﬁnite dimensional, namely that n = m is
a natural number. We may thus ﬁnd a basis {x1, . . . , xn} of U. In particular these
vectors are linearly independent in U, and thus also in V . By Proposition 2.4, it
follows that the set {x1, . . . , xn} is a basis of V , so its span is V . But the span is
also U, and the claim follows.
□
Remark 2.13 Much as in Remark 2.6, the ﬁnite dimensionality assumption cannot
be avoided. Indeed, the linear space c00 from Example 2.4 is, as we saw, of countably
inﬁnite dimension but it does contain proper subspaces of the same dimension. For
instance, it is easy to verify that the set c000 of all sequences in c00 whose ﬁrst term
is 0, is a proper subspace of c00 even though it is isomorphic to c00, and thus has the
same dimension as the ambient space.

Linear Spaces
2.4.2 Kernels and Images
With any linear operator T : V →W one can associate a subspace of the domain,
called the kernel of T , and a subspace of the codomain, called the image of T . As
we show below, the kernel sufﬁces to detect whether or not T is injective.
Deﬁnition 2.8 Let T : V →W be a linear operator. The set
Ker(T ) = {x ∈V | T (x) = 0}
is called the kernel of T .
Theorem 2.7 The kernel of a linear operator T : V →W is a linear subspace
of V .
Proof In Proposition 2.5 we already noted that T (0) = 0 and thus 0 ∈Ker(T ). All
we need to do now is show that the kernel is closed under vector addition and scalar
product. Indeed, if x, y ∈Ker(T ), then
T (x + y) = T (x) + T (y) = 0 + 0 = 0
and thus x + y ∈Ker(T ). Similarly, for all α ∈K, if x ∈Ker(T ), then
T (αx) = αT (x) = α · 0 = 0
and thus αx ∈Ker(T ) and the proof is complete.
□
Theorem 2.8 A linear operator T : V →W is injective if, and only if, its kernel is
trivial, i.e., Ker(T ) = {0}.
Proof If T is injective, then since we already know that T (0) = 0, it follows that
T (x) = 0 implies x = 0, and thus Ker(T ) = {0}, and is thus trivial. Conversely,
suppose that the kernel of T is trivial and suppose that
T (x) = T (y)
for some x, y ∈V . Then
T (x −y) = T (x) −T (y) = 0
and thus
x −y ∈Ker(T ).
But then x −y = 0, and so x = y, showing that T is injective.
□

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
55
Another subspace naturally obtained from a linear operator is its image.
Deﬁnition 2.9 Let T : V →W be a linear operator. The set Im(T ) = {T (x) | x ∈
V }, namely the set-theoretic image of T , is called the image of T .
Proposition 2.10 The image of a linear operator T : V →W is a linear subspace
of W.
Proof Obviously, T (V ) is not empty. Further, if x, y ∈Im(T ), then x = T (x′) and
y = T (y′) for some vectors x′, y′ ∈V . It then follows that
x + y = T (x′) + T (y′) = T (x′ + y′) ∈Im(T ).
Similarly, one shows that αx ∈Im(T ) for all x ∈Im(T ) and all scalars α ∈K.
□
The following result, which the reader may recognize as the rank-nullity theorem,
has important consequences for ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces.
Lemma 2.3 The equality
dim(V ) = dim(Ker(T)) + dim(Im(T))
holds for all linear operators T : V →W between ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces.
Proof We present the general strategy, inviting the reader to ﬁll-in the details. Choose
a basis {x1, . . . , xk} for Ker(T ). Then augment this basis by (if needed) adding
vectors to it, so as to obtain a basis {x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , ym} of V and show that
{T (y1), . . . , T (ym)} is a basis for Im(T ).
□
Remark 2.14 The proof above can be adapted to obtain a similar result for inﬁnite
dimensional linear spaces, provided one handles cardinal arithmetic with care, of
course. However, such a result is not of great importance and we thus avoid its details.
Corollary 2.4 For a linear operator T : V →W between ﬁnite dimensional linear
spaces of equal dimension, the conditions
• T is injective
• T is surjective
• T is bijective
are equivalent.
Proof We have seen that T is injective if, and only if, its kernel is trivial, namely
precisely when dim(Ker(T )) = 0. It follows then that T is injective if, and only
if, dim(V ) = dim(Im(T )). But since dim(V ) = dim(W), it follows by Theorem
2.6, that dim(V ) = dim(Im(T )) holds if, and only if, Im(T ) = W, in other words,
precisely when T is surjective. This completes the veriﬁcation of the non-trivial
arguments in the proof.

2.4.3 Products and Quotients
We now present the product construction for two linear spaces V and W over the
same ﬁeld K. We endow the set V × W with an addition operation and a scalar
product that turn it into a linear space, as follows. Given (x1, x2), (y1, y2) ∈V × W,
and α ∈K, the addition operation is given by
(x1, x2) + (y1, y2) = (x1 + y1, x2 + y2)
and the scalar product operation is given by
α(x1, x2) = (αx1, αx2).
Theorem 2.9 For linear spaces V and W over the same ﬁeld K, the set V × W,
when endowed with addition and scalar multiplication as above, is a linear space
over the ﬁeld K.
Proof The veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms is straightforward. For instance,
the additively neutral element is (0, 0) since
(x1, x2) + (0, 0) = (x1 + 0, x2 + 0) = (x1, x2)
for all (x1, x2) ∈V × W. We leave the rest of the veriﬁcation to the reader.
□
Obviously, one can similarly deﬁne the product V1 × · · · × Vn of any ﬁnite number
of linear spaces, and even the product of any collection of linear spaces. It is also
evident, upon inspection of the linear structure of the linear space Rn, that Rn is
the n-fold product of R with itself, where R is viewed as a linear space over itself.
Similarly, Cn is the n-fold product of C with itself.
We now turn to consider the quotient construction of a linear space by a linear
subspace. This construction is, in some sense, the reversal of taking the product of
linear spaces. We refer the reader to Sect.1.2.15 of the Preliminaries for basic facts
about equivalence relations.
Deﬁnition 2.10 Let V be a linear space and U a subspace of it. Two elements
x1, x2 ∈V are said to be equivalent modulo U if
x1 −x2 ∈U
that is, if
x1 = x2 + u
for some u ∈U. This relation is denoted by x1 = x2(mod U), by x ≡U y, or simply
by x ≡y if U is evident.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
57
We now show that ≡is an equivalence relation on V . Indeed, for all x, y, z ∈V
x −x = 0 ∈U,
and thus
x ≡x,
so that ≡is reﬂexive. Further,
x ≡y =⇒x −y ∈U =⇒y −x = (−1) · (x −y) ∈U =⇒y ≡x,
and thus ≡is symmetric. Finally,
x −y, y −z ∈U =⇒x −z = (x −y) + (y −z) ∈U =⇒x ≡z,
and so ≡is transitive.
Recall that the equivalence class of any vector x ∈V is the set
[x] = {y ∈V | x ≡y}.
In other words, it is the set of all vectors of the form x + u, where u ∈U. For that
reason the equivalence class [x] is also denoted by
x + U.
It follows from the general theory of equivalence relations that {x + U | x ∈V } is a
partition of V .
Example 2.27 As a simple example, consider the usual 2-dimensional plane R2 and
its subspace Y consisting of the ordinates. Let the element r ∈R2 be the vector O−P
from the origin to the point P in the plane. The equivalence class [r]Y, formed by the
vectors of R2 equivalent mod Y to r, is clearly given by all vectors O −Pi with Pi
lying on the parallel line to the Y-axis passing through the point P; all these vectors
are equivalent mod Y to each other.
The fact that the entire 2-dimensional space is partitioned by all such equivalence
classes is simply the fact that R2 is the disjoint union of all the lines parallel to the
Y axis, which are precisely the translates x + Y of Y.

We now turn to investigate the quotient set V /U = {x+U | x ∈V } of equivalence
classes modulo U. It is natural to introduce an addition and a scalar product on V /U
by the formulas
(y + U) + (z + U) = (y + z) + U
and
α(y + U) = (αy) + U,
but we must ﬁrst verify that these operations are well-deﬁned, namely that they do
not depend on the chosen representatives. Indeed, for all x, y, x′, y′ ∈V , we need
to show that if
x + U = x′ + U
and
y + U = y′ + U,
then
(x + y) + U = (x′ + y′) + U.
But the former implies that
x′ −x ∈U
and
y′ −y ∈U
while the latter will be implied by showing that (x′ + y′)−(x + y) ∈U. And indeed,
since U is closed under addition,
(x′ + y′) −(x + y) = (x′ −x) + (y′ −y) ∈U.
A similar argument shows that the scalar product above is well-deﬁned and thus we
see that the quotient set V /U of equivalence classes is naturally endowed with an
addition operation and a scalar product operation.
Theorem 2.10 Let V be a linear space and U ⊆V a subspace. The quotient set
V /U of equivalence classes modulo U, with the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication as given above, is a linear space whose zero vector is U. Moreover,
the canonical projection π : V →V /U given by π(x) = x +U is a surjective linear
operator.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
59
Proof To see that U = 0 + U behaves neutrally with respect to addition, note that
for all x + U ∈V /U
(x + U) + U = (x + U) + (0 + U) = (x + 0) + U = x + U.
The rest of the veriﬁcation of the linear space axioms, as well as the claims about
the canonical projection, follow similarly and are left for the reader.
□
Deﬁnition 2.11 The linear space V /U constructed in Theorem 2.10 is called the
quotient space of V with respect to U, or simply as V modulo U.
Continuing the example above, R2/Y, which geometrically can be thought of as
the space of all vertical lines in R2, is a linear space. Another, more complicated,
example is c0/c00, the quotient of the space c0 of all converging sequences of (say)
real numbers, by the subspace of all eventually 0 sequences. The quotient may be
thought of as the space of all sequences modulo ﬁnite changes. In analysis it is well
known that the limit of a sequence is insensitive to ﬁnite changes in the sequence,
and so it is precisely this quotient that is of interest already in elementary analysis.
2.4.4 Complementary Subspaces
Contemplating the quotient space associated to Example 2.27, one realizes that R2/Y
is isomorphic to X, and that under this isomorphism, the canonical projection π :
R2 →R2/Y is nothing but the projection of R2 onto the X axis. This observation
generalizes to any quotient space construction, as we now show.
Deﬁnition 2.12 Two subspaces U and W of a given linear space V are said to be
complementary
• if the only vector they have in common is the zero vector, in other words ifU ∩W =
{0}; and
• if U +W = V ; that is, given x ∈V , there exist u ∈U and w ∈W with x = u +w.
Remark 2.15 The decomposition above of an element x ∈V as the sum x = u + w
is in fact unique. Indeed, if x = u + w and also x = u′ + w′, with u, u′ ∈U and
w, w′ ∈W, then
0 = x −x = (u + w) −(u′ + w′) =⇒u −u′ = w′ −w.
But u −u′ ∈U and w′ −w ∈W, and since the only element in U ∩W is the zero
vector, it follows that u −u′ = 0 = w′ −w, and therefore, u = u′ and w = w′. This
unique decomposition is said to express V as a direct sum of its subspaces U and W,
a fact denoted by V = U ⊕W.
The following example shows that a given subspace U ⊆V may admit more than
one complementary subspace.

We may now present the main theorem relating complementary subspaces and
the quotient construction.
Theorem 2.11 Given a linear space V and two complementary subspaces U and
W, the quotient space V /U is naturally isomorphic to W (the meaning of ‘naturally’
is discussed below).
Proof Recall from Theorem 2.10 that the canonical projection π : V →V /U, given
by π(x) = x +U, is a linear operator. The result will be established by showing that
the restriction of π to W ⊆V is an isomorphism between W and V /U. All we have
to do is show that the restriction is a bijection. For injectivity we use Theorem 2.8
and show the kernel of the restriction is trivial. For that, suppose that π(w) = 0 for
some w ∈W, that is (recall that the zero vector in V /U is U)
w + U = U
and so w ∈U. But since
U ∩W = {0},
it follows that w = 0, as needed. For surjectivity, let y + U be an arbitrary element
in V /U. Writing y = u + w, with u ∈U and w ∈W, we get that
y + U = (u + w) + U = (u + U) + (w + U) = w + U = π(w).
□
Remark 2.16 The meaning of the isomorphism above being natural (or canonical)
is that its construction does not depend on any choice of basis. This is an important
observation since, as we saw, in inﬁnite dimensional spaces it may be impossible to
actually describe any basis.
Corollary 2.5 Given a linear space V and a subspace U ⊆V , any two subspaces
W1 and W2 that are complementary to U are naturally isomorphic.

2.4 Subspaces, Products, and Quotients
61
Proof Each of W1 and W2 is naturally isomorphic to V /U.
□
In the case of complementary spaces, the stated isomorphism is independent of
a basis but it is dependent on the ability to express the ambient space as the direct
sum of the given subspace and each of its complements. If the latter can be done
explicitly, then an explicit formula for the isomorphism will emerge.

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
So far in our treatment of linear spaces two geometric aspects are missing, namely
angles between vectors and the length of a vector. This situation is unavoidable since
in general linear spaces it need not be possible to coherently deﬁne any of these
notions. In the presence of extra structure, these notions become available, as we
discuss below.

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
63
2.5.1 Inner Product Spaces
The reader is most likely familiar with the standard inner product on Rn, i.e.,
⟨x, y⟩=
n

k=1
xk yk.
The deﬁnition of a general inner product space is then a generalization of certain
properties the standard inner product has. We will not pause here to motivate this
deﬁnition any further, except for two comments. The ﬁrst comment is that the results
below will show that an inner product allows one (at least in the real case) to speak of
angles between vectors, thus obtaining retrospective justiﬁcation for the axioms. The
second comment pertains to the non-arbitrary nature of the standard inner product;
the reader is invited to discover it from elementary geometry, i.e., the law of cosines.
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Inner Product Space) Let V be a linear space over K, where K is
either R or C. Assume that a function ⟨−, −⟩: V × V →K is given. The function
⟨−, −⟩is said to be an inner product if for all x, y, z ∈V and α, β ∈K, the following
conditions hold.
1. Conjugate symmetry or Hermitian symmetry, i.e., ⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩, where w
denotes the complex conjugate of w.
2. Linearity in the second argument, i.e., ⟨x, αy + βz⟩= α⟨x, y⟩+ β⟨x, z⟩.
3. The inner product is positive deﬁnite, i.e., ⟨x, x⟩≥0 for all x ∈V , and ⟨x, x⟩= 0
implies that x = 0, the zero vector. In particular, we then introduce the norm of
x to be ∥x∥= √⟨x, x⟩.
The linear space V together with the function ⟨−, −⟩is then called an inner
product space. To emphasize that K = R we use the term real inner product space,
while the case K = C is given the term complex inner product space. The scalar
⟨x, y⟩is the inner product of the given vectors (in that order!).
Remark 2.17 Notice that when K = R, conjugate symmetry reduces to symmetry,
that is
⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩,
and the inner product is also linear in its ﬁrst argument, namely,
⟨αx + βy, z⟩= α⟨x, z⟩+ β⟨y, z⟩.
In the complex case one generally has that
⟨αx + βy, z⟩= α⟨x, z⟩+ β⟨y, z⟩,
as follows easily from conjugate symmetry and linearity in the second argument. In
both real and complex inner product spaces, the inner product is additive in each

64
2
Linear Spaces
argument. We mention as well that in mathematical circles it is common to write
(x, y) instead of ⟨y, x⟩, that is to deﬁne an inner product as being linear in the ﬁrst
argument rather than the second one. Obviously, the difference is only cosmetic.
Example 2.29 Consider the linear space Rn and the deﬁnition
x · y = (x1, . . . , xn) · (y1, . . . , yn) =
n

k=1
xk yk.
With this deﬁnition it is easily seen that Rn becomes a real inner product space.
Similarly, considering Cn, deﬁning
x · y = (x1, . . . , xn) · (y1, . . . , yn) =
n

k=1
xk yk
endows Cn with the structure of a complex inner product space. Notice that for
x, y ∈R∞the ‘obvious deﬁnition’
x · y = (x1, . . .) · (y1, . . .) =
∞

k=1
xk yk
fails to endow R∞with the structure of an inner product space, simply because the
sum may fail to converge, and thus this is not even a function.
Example 2.30 Consider the space C(I, R) of continuous real valued functions on
the interval I = [a, b]. The familiar properties of the integral show at once that
deﬁning, for all x, y ∈C(I, R),
⟨x, y⟩=
b

a
dt x(t)y(t)
endows C(I, R) with the structure of a real inner product space. With the proper
conjugation in the integral above, the space C(I, C) of continuous complex valued
functions becomes a complex inner product space.
Before we present any further examples let us explore some elementary, and not so
elementary, general results.
Proposition 2.11 For all vectors x, y in an inner product space V (either real or
complex)
∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + 2|⟨x, y⟩| + ∥y∥2.

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
65
Proof Expanding ∥x + y∥2 = ⟨x + y, x + y⟩we see that
⟨x + y, x + y⟩= ⟨x, x + y⟩+ ⟨y, x + y⟩= ⟨x, x⟩+ ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩+ ⟨y, y⟩
and thus the claim will follow by showing that
⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩≤2 · |⟨x, y⟩|,
which is immediate if V is a real inner product space. In the complex case suppose
that ⟨x, y⟩= u + iv. Then
⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩= ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨x, y⟩= 2 · u
and since
|u| =

u2 ≤

u2 + v2 = |u + iv| = |⟨x, y⟩|,
the result follows.
□
The geometric interpretation of the norm ∥x∥is that it is the length of the vector x.
As for the geometric meaning of the inner product, notice that any non-zero vector
x ∈V can be normalized by deﬁning ˆx = x/∥x∥, a vector of unit length. For any
vector x of unit length and an arbitrary vector y, the scalar ⟨x, y⟩is interpreted as the
component of the vector y in the direction x. Consequently, we make the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.14 Let V be an inner product space. Two vectors x, y ∈V are said to
be orthogonal or perpendicular if ⟨x, y⟩= 0.
Theorem 2.12 (Pythagoras’ Theorem) The equality
∥x + y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2
holds for all orthogonal vectors x and y in an inner product space.
Proof ∥x + y∥2 = ⟨x + y, x + y⟩= ∥x∥2 + ⟨x, y⟩+ ⟨y, x⟩+ ∥y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2.
□
2.5.2 The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
The following inequality is among the most important inequalities in mathematics.
It has numerous uses, some of which we will see immediately and some later on.

66
2
Linear Spaces
Theorem 2.13 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) The inequality
|⟨x, y⟩| ≤∥x∥∥y∥
holds for all vectors x, y in an inner product space V .
Proof For simplicity let us assume V is a real inner product space (only a small
adaptation is needed for the complex case). The inequality is trivial when x = 0 and
so we proceed assuming that x ̸= 0. Let ˆx = x/∥x∥be the normalization of x, so in
particular ∥ˆx∥= 1. Dividing the desired inequality by ∥x∥we see that we need to
establish the inequality
|⟨ˆx, y⟩| ≤∥y∥
(and so the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality acquires the interpretation that the absolute
value of a component of y in a given unit direction sets a lower bound on the length
of y). Rewriting y to identify its component in the ˆx direction we obtain
y = yˆx + (y −yˆx)
where yˆx = ⟨ˆx, y⟩ˆx. Since
⟨ˆx, y −yˆx⟩= ⟨ˆx, y⟩−⟨ˆx, yˆx⟩= ⟨ˆx, y⟩−⟨ˆx, y⟩⟨ˆx, ˆx⟩= 0
it follows that yˆx and y −yˆx are orthogonal. Pythagoras’ Theorem (Theorem 2.12)
now yields
∥y∥2 = ∥yˆx∥2 + ∥y −yˆx∥2 ≥∥yˆx∥2 = ⟨ˆx, y⟩2.
Extracting square roots completes the proof.
□
Corollary 2.6 Since we now know that
−1 ≤⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥≤1
for all non-zero vectors x and y in an arbitrary real inner product space, it follows
that
θ = arccos ⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥
is deﬁned. Noting that
⟨x, y⟩= cos θ∥x∥∥y∥
we deﬁne θ to be the angle between the vectors x and y.
We had just seen that a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is that, in
a real inner product space, angles between vectors are a well-deﬁned notion. There

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
67
are many more consequences of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, among which we
mention one. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle in Quantum Mechanics is the
result of applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a certain Hilbert space, suitably
constructed. Unfortunately, this result falls slightly short of the scope of this book.
2.5.3 Normed Spaces
In an inner product space every vector can be assigned a norm. A normed space is
then an abstraction of certain key properties of this norm. This is useful since, as will
be shown below, many linear spaces fail to admit an inner product but do admit the
structure of a normed space. In such spaces one may still speak of the length of a
vector, but not (necessarily) of angles between vectors.
Deﬁnition 2.15 (Normed Space) A linear space V with a function x →∥x∥, which
associates with every vector x ∈V a real number ∥x∥, called the norm of x, is said
to be a normed space if for all vectors x, y ∈V and α ∈K the following hold.
1. Positivity, i.e., ∥x∥> 0 provided x ̸= 0.
2. Homogeneity, i.e., ∥αx∥= |α|∥x∥.
3. Triangle inequality, i.e., ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
The following result is an immediate consequence of the axioms.
Proposition 2.12 Let V be a normed linear space. For all vectors x, y ∈V:
1. ∥x∥= 0 if, and only if, x = 0.
2. ∥−x∥= ∥x∥.
3. ∥x −y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
4. |∥x∥−∥y∥| ≤∥x −y∥.
Proof
1. Using homogeneity, ∥0∥= ∥0 · 0∥= 0 · ∥0∥= 0, and together with positivity
the claim follows.
2. Using homogeneity, ∥−x∥= ∥(−1) · x∥= 1 · ∥x∥= ∥x∥.
3. Using (2) and the triangle inequality, ∥x −y∥= ∥x + (−y)∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
4. We need to show that −∥x −y∥≤∥x∥−∥y∥≤∥x −y∥. Using (3) and
the triangle inequality, ∥x∥= ∥(x + y) −y∥≤∥x + y∥+ ∥y∥and similarly
∥y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥x −y∥, as needed.
□
The deﬁnition of normed space was motivated by certain intuitive properties that the
lengths of vectors, as modeled by the norm in an inner product space, satisfy. The
next result shows that the inner product formalism indeed gives rise to a normed
space, as expected.
Lemma 2.4 Any inner product space, with its associated notion of norm, is a normed
space.

68
2
Linear Spaces
Proof Recall that the norm in an inner product space is given by ∥x∥= √⟨x, x⟩,
and condition 1 in the deﬁnition of normed space is immediate. For condition 2, we
have that
∥αx∥2 = ⟨αx, αx⟩= αα⟨x, x⟩= |α|2∥x∥2
and the desired equality follows. As for the triangle inequality, by Proposition 2.11
∥x + y∥2 = ⟨x + y, x + y⟩≤∥x∥2 + 2|⟨x, y⟩| + ∥y∥2
and by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we obtain that
∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + 2∥x∥∥y∥+ ∥y∥2 = (∥x∥+ ∥y∥)2,
and the result follows.
□
We close the section, and the chapter, by introducing two very important families
of normed spaces. The ℓp spaces, introduced already in Example 2.25, are spaces of
sequences and each carries its own norm, the ℓp norm. The second family of spaces,
the pre-L p spaces, allude to the family of L p spaces and the L p norm. The pre-L p
spaces are, in a sense, the continuous version of the ℓp spaces and the L p spaces are
the completion of the pre-L p spaces (completions are discussed in Chap.4).
2.5.4 The Family of ℓp Spaces
For the reader’s convenience, we repeat here the deﬁnition of the ℓp spaces, and
augment it with the deﬁnition of the ℓp norm.
Deﬁnition 2.16 Let 1 ≤p < ∞be a real number. The set ℓp consists of all
sequences x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) of complex numbers for which
∞

k=1
|xk|p < ∞.
The ℓp-norm of x is
∥x∥p =
 ∞

k=1
|xk|p
1/p
.
The ℓ∞space is the space of all bounded sequences x of complex numbers and the
ℓ∞norm is
∥x∥∞= sup
k
|xk|.

2.5 Inner Product Spaces and Normed Spaces
69
Note that it is immediate that ∥x∥p = 0 if, and only if, x = 0. These spaces are over
the ﬁeld C. By considering sequences of real numbers one obtains similar spaces
over the ﬁeld R which, ambiguously, are also referred to as ℓp spaces.
To further investigate the structure of ℓp, we need the following elementary result.
Proposition 2.13 (Young’s Inequality) The inequality
ab ≤a p
p + bq
q
holds for all positive real numbers p and q satisfying 1/p + 1/q = 1, and non-
negative real numbers a and b, with equality if, and only if, a p = bq.
Proof Recall the weighted arithmetic-geometric means inequality
w
xw1
1 xw2
2
≤w1x1 + w2x2
w
which holds for all non-negative real numbers x1, x2, and all positive weights w1, w2,
with w = w1 + w2. Applying this inequality to the numbers x1 = a p and x2 = bq,
with weights w1 = 1/p and w2 = 1/q, yields the desired inequality.
□
The next inequality is used often when manipulating elements of the spaces ℓp.
It is used below to establish the triangle inequality when proving that each ℓp space,
with its ℓp norm, is a normed space. It is convenient to ﬁrst introduce the following
notation. For any two sequences x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .) and y = (y1, . . . , yk, . . .), let
xy = (x1y1, . . . , xk yk, . . .),
namely, the vector of component-wise products of the given vectors.
Theorem 2.14 (Hölder’s Inequality) Given positive real numbers p and q for which
1/p + 1/q = 1, the inequality
∥xy∥1 ≤∥x∥p · ∥y∥q
holds for all x ∈ℓp and y ∈ℓq.
Proof The case where either ∥x∥p = 0 or ∥y∥q = 0 is trivial and so we may assume
this is not so. By component-wise division of x and y, respectively, by ∥x∥p and
∥y∥q, we may assume that ∥x∥p = ∥y∥q = 1, namely that

and, by simplifying, the claimed inequality is established.
□
Theorem 2.16 For all 1 ≤p ≤∞the space ℓp is a normed linear space.
Proof The case p = ∞is left for the reader, so assume that p < ∞. The non-
negativity of ∥x∥p is clear from the deﬁnition of the norm and it was already noted
that it is immediate that ∥x∥= 0 implies x = 0. Homogeneity, is also immediate,
since

is precisely Minkowski’s Inequality (Theorem 2.15).
□
2.5.5 The Family of Pre-L p Spaces
With the large family {ℓp}1≤p≤∞of normed spaces at hand one can put the general
theory to use for many sequences. Noticing that ℓp ⊂ℓq for all 1 ≤p < q ≤∞, and
with sequences in ℓp converging faster to 0 than sequences in ℓq, given a bounded
sequence one would typically try to identify a suitable p such that the sequence is
found in ℓp, and proceed to apply the general theory to the problem at hand.
As long as sequences are concerned, the ℓp spaces are adequate but, quite often,
when modeling a physical problem mathematically one obtains a function rather
than a sequence. It is thus desirable to consider suitable normed spaces of functions.
As explained above, obtaining the correct analogue of the ℓp spaces, namely the L p
spaces, requires some more sophisticated machinery than what we had presented so
far, and so at this point we present what we call the pre-L p spaces.
For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the ambient linear space C([0, ∞), R)
of all continuous function x : [0, ∞) →R (we note that with the necessary mod-
iﬁcations in the coming deﬁnitions and proofs, one may alter the domain, as well
as consider complex-valued functions). The pre-L p space, for 1 ≤p < ∞, is the
subset K p of C([0, ∞), R) whose elements are those functions x with
∞

0
dt |x(t)|p < ∞
where the integral is the usual Riemann integral (since we only consider continuous
functions, the theory of Riemann integration is sufﬁcient). The L p norm of x ∈K p
is given by
∥x∥p =
⎛
⎝
∞

0
dt |x(t)|p
⎞
⎠
1/p
and we immediately note that ∥x∥= 0 implies x = 0 (due to the continuity of x).
Lastly, K∞is the space of all bounded continuous functions x : [0, ∞) →R and
the L∞norm is given by

72
2
Linear Spaces
∥x∥∞=
sup
0≤t<∞
{|x(t)|}.
The rest of the section is devoted to showing that K p with the L p norm is a normed
space, for each 1 ≤p ≤∞. In fact, the proof is formally identical to the case of the
ℓp spaces. Indeed, the only ingredient one needs is the following version of Hölder’s
Inequality.
Theorem 2.17 (Hölder’s Inequality) Given positive real numbers p and q such that
1/p + 1/q = 1, the inequality
∥xy∥1 ≤∥x∥p · ∥y∥q
holds for all x ∈K p and y ∈Kq, where xy is the function (xy)(t) = x(t)y(t).
Proof An inspection of the proof of Hölder’s Inequality for sequences reveals that it
was obtained by a point-wise application of Young’s Inequality as well as properties
of summation which are well-known to hold for integration as well, and so the same
argument can be used to establish Hölder’s Inequality for functions.
□
The details of the proof of the following result are now formally identical to the proof
of Theorem 2.16
Theorem 2.18 For all 1 ≤p ≤∞the pre-L p space K p is a normed linear space.
Remark 2.18 Note again that the domain of the functions x in a pre-L p space can be
altered (sometimes with necessary extra care) and that the codomain can be replaced
by C (with obvious adaptations to the deﬁnition of the L p norm). All such spaces
are still called pre-L p spaces and denoted, ambiguously, by K p. In particular, the
space C([a, b], R) of continuous real-valued functions on a closed interval can be
endowed with an L p norm and thus is a K p space.

Further Reading
Introductory level texts on linear algebra typically treat linear spaces with a strong
emphasis on techniques of matrices. When bases are not explicitly available, as in
the inﬁnite dimensional case, this approach must be replaced by a coordinate-free
approach, as was done in this chapter. For an introductory level text treating linear
algebra in a coordinate-free fashion see Chaps.10–12 of Dummit and Foote [2]. A
more advanced text with a coordinate-free approach, as well as an algebraically much
deeper approach to linear algebra, making the connection between linear spaces and
modules, is Roman [3]. Another text that bridges the gap between matrix-centric
linear algebra and Hilbert space theory is Brown [1]. The reader seeking to enhance
her intuition and ability with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is advised to consider
Steele [4].

Topological Spaces
Abstract This chapter, which is quite independent from the previous one, introduces
topological spaces. It includes a detailed motivation for the deﬁnitions so as to assist
in the digestion of the rather abstract concepts involved. The chapter is, by necessity,
only a glimpse of the vast realms of topology. The presentation and the choice of
concepts and results given are geared towards the applications of topology in Hilbert
space theory while ensuring the reader develops a sufﬁcient level of familiarity with
the techniques (and the at times eccentric nature) of topology.

Topology is often described as rubber-sheet geometry, i.e., the study of geometric
properties that are insensitive to stretching and shrinking, without tearing or gluing.
Famously, for a topologist then, there is no difference between a cup and a donut.
The importance and impact of topology on modern mathematics is quite difﬁcult to
quantify but virtually impossible to exaggerate. Without a doubt its place as one of
the pillars of mathematics is secured.
The deﬁnition of a topological space is an abstraction of part of the structure of
R, speciﬁcally that part that allows one to speak of continuity and convergence. The
choice for the topological notions introduced in this chapter is dictated by two needs.
One need is to familiarize the reader with those topological concepts that are most
relevant in the context of this book, the other is to familiarize the reader with topology
proper, its main results, and its techniques. These two needs pull in slightly different
directions and this chapter represents a compromise. We aim to provide the reader
with sufﬁcient motivation for the concepts while keeping things ﬁrmly grounded in
analysis.
Section3.1 presents the deﬁnition of a topology and the accompanying notion
of continuity, followed by a detailed construction of the Euclidean topology on the
real numbers R. The associated notion of continuity is shown to be equivalent to
the usual one, motivating the deﬁnitions. Section3.2 is a basic study of convergence
in the topological setting, its relation to cluster points, and its behaviour under the
ﬁrst countability axiom. Section3.3 is concerned with techniques for constructing
topologies, in particular by forcing a collection of sets to be open sets and by forcing a

collection of functions to be continuous. Coproducts, products, and quotients are then
given as particular examples. Section3.4 discusses the Hausdorff separation property
and topological connectivity, and Sect.3.5 is a study of compactness, developing
enough material to prove the Heine-Borel Theorem from a topological perspective.
3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
The deﬁnition of a topology is quite simple; a certain collection of subsets of a set
satisfying some simple to state axioms. However, without further motivation, the
axioms may appear arbitrary and not too palatable. To assist the reader digest the
notion, the deﬁnitions below are immediately succeeded by a detailed motivating
discussion taking place in the familiar setting of the real numbers R. The motivation
we give is of a topology as the result of stripping away redundancies in the deﬁnition
of continuity. We then explore various examples of topological spaces.
3.1.1 Deﬁnition and Motivation
We present the deﬁnition of a topological space followed by the deﬁnition of a
continuous function between topological spaces. The abstract deﬁnitions are then
exempliﬁed in the context of the real numbers, establishing the Euclidean topology
on R, and, through the process, justifying the abstract deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A topology τX on an arbitrary set X is a collection of subsets of X
such that the following conditions hold.
1. Both the empty set ∅and the entire set X are members of τX.
2. τX is stable under arbitrary unions. That is, if {Ui}i∈I is a family of elements in
τX, then

i∈I
Ui ∈τX.
3. τX is stable under ﬁnite intersections. That is, if U1, . . . ,Um are members of τX,
then
U1 ∩· · · ∩Um ∈τX.
The pair (X, τX) is called a topological space and the members of τX are referred to
as open sets. Often though, we speak of the topological space X without explicitly
mentioning τX. We write (X, τ) if there is no need to syntactically remind ourselves
that the collection τ consists of the open sets of X.
Remark 3.1 Clearly, stability under ﬁnite intersections is equivalent to the condition
that U1 ∩U2 ∈τX for any two open sets U1,U2 ∈τX.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
77
For the following deﬁnition, and as a general advise for safely taking the ﬁrst few
steps into the realm of topology, the reader may wish to review the basic properties
of inverse images (e.g. Sect.1.2.9 of the Preliminaries).
Deﬁnition 3.2 Let(X, τX)and(Y, τY )betopologicalspaces.Afunction f : X →Y
is said to be continuous if f −1(U) is an open set in X whenever U is an open set in
Y. In other words, f is continuous if
U ∈τY =⇒f −1(U) ∈τX.
The following results establish a particular topology on the set R of real numbers,
and investigate the notion of continuity with respect to that topology. The aim is two-
fold; to exemplify the deﬁnitions in a concrete and familiar setting, and to motivate
the deﬁnitions.
Recall that a function f : R →R is said to be continuous if, intuitively, small
changes in the value of x cause small changes in the value of f (x). Formally, f is
continuous if for every point x0 ∈R and ε > 0 one can ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that if
|x −x0| < δ, then | f (x) −f (x0)| < ε. The absolute value function is used here
in the role of a measurement device for distances. However, the notion of continuity
is quite insensitive to numerous changes one can perform on the absolute value
function. Intuitively, continuity is a local phenomenon, and so if one truncates the
absolute value function and deﬁnes
|x|t =

|x|
if |x| < 1
1
otherwise,
then continuity with respect to |x| and with respect to |x|t coincide. Scaling effects,
such as deﬁning |x|2 = 2|x|, also have no effect on continuity in the precise sense
that continuity with respect to |x| and with respect to |x|2 coincide.
The decision to use the absolute value function in formulating the deﬁnition of
continuity (or, more generally, that of limit) is thus revealed to be an arbitrary choice
among many equivalently valid alternatives. It is now a natural question whether one
can distill a deﬁnition of continuity devoid of any arbitrary and irrelevant structure
and consequently furnish a better understanding of the concept of continuity. The
afﬁrmative answer is given as follows. Call a subset U ⊆R open if for every x ∈U
there exists an ε > 0 such that Bε(x) ⊆U, where we deﬁne
Bε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y| < ε} = (x −ε, x + ε),
the open interval of length ε about x. With the aim of utilizing these sets to deﬁne a
topology on R, we ﬁrst prove that any open interval is an open set.
Proposition 3.1 The open interval Bε(x) = (x −ε, x +ε), for all x ∈R and ε > 0,
is an open set.

Topological Spaces
Proof Given y ∈Bε(x) = (x −ε, x + ε), we are required to ﬁnd a δ > 0 such that
Bδ(y) = (y −δ, y + δ) ⊆Bε(x). Let
δ = ε −|x −y|
and note that δ > 0. It is now elementary algebra to verify that this δ suits our
purposes.
□
We can now present our ﬁrst example of a topology; an important enough example
that we state it as a theorem.
Theorem 3.1 The collection τ of all open sets U ⊆R is a topology on R.
Proof The empty set vacuously satisﬁes the condition for being an open set, simply
since it has no points at all. The set R itself is clearly an open set, since if x ∈R, then
x ∈B1(x) ⊆R. Thus the ﬁrst condition in the deﬁnition of a topology is satisﬁed.
To show stability under arbitrary unions, suppose that {Ui}i∈I is a family of open
sets in R and we need to show that
U =

i∈I
Ui
is open. Indeed, if x ∈U, then x ∈Ui for some i ∈I. But since Ui is open, there
exists a δ > 0 with
Bδ(x) ⊆Ui ⊆U,
as required. It remains to show for any two open sets U1,U2 ⊆R that U1 ∩U2 is
open. Indeed, if x ∈U1 ∩U2, then there are δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 with
Bδ1(x) ⊆U1
Bδ2(x) ⊆U2.
Setting δ = min{δ1, δ2} (and noting that δ > 0), one easily sees that
Bδ(x) ⊆Bδ1(x) ∩Bδ2(x) ⊆U1 ∩U2,
as required, and thus completing the proof.
□
Deﬁnition 3.3 The collection of all open sets U ⊆R as just deﬁned is called the
Euclidean topology on R. It is also commonly referred to as the standard topology
or the ordinary topology.
The open sets turn out to contain enough information about the space R in order to
completely characterize continuity, as follows.
Theorem 3.2 A function f : R →R is continuous in the usual meaning if, and
only if, f −1(U) is an open set for every open set U ⊆R.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
79
Proof Suppose f is continuous, and let U be an open set. Our aim is to show that
f −1(U) is open. Let x0 ∈f −1(U), that is y0 = f (x0) ∈U, and our aim is to ﬁnd a
δ > 0 such that
Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U).
Since U is open, there exists an ε > 0 such that
Bε(y0) = (y0 −ε, y0 + ε) ⊆U.
By continuity of f , there exists a δ > 0 such that | f (x) −y0| < ε, provided that
|x −x0| < δ. But that means that for every x ∈Bδ(x0)
f (x) ∈Bε(y0) ⊆U.
In other words, x ∈f −1(U) for all x in the set Bδ(x0), and so
Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U),
which is what we set out to obtain.
In the other direction, suppose that f −1(U) is an open set whenever U is an
open set. Given a point x0 ∈R and an ε > 0, let y0 = f (x0) and consider the set
U = Bε(y0), and notice that U is itself an open set. By assumption, the set f −1(U)
is an open set, and it contains x0. There is thus a δ > 0 such that Bδ(x0) ⊆f −1(U).
Thus, if |x −x0| < δ, then x ∈Bδ(x0), and therefore f (x) ∈Bε(y0), showing that
| f (x) −f (x0)| < ε. In other words, f is continuous at x0. Since x0 was arbitrary,
f is continuous.
□
Recalling Deﬁnition 3.2, the result above can be restated as follows.
Theorem 3.3 A function f : R →R is continuous in the usual sense if, and only
if, it is continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology on R.
This result justiﬁes and motivates Deﬁnition 3.2 and, a-priori, the deﬁnition of a
topology. Let us pause to reﬂect on the situation right now. The familiar notion
of continuity for functions f : R →R was seen to be faithfully captured by the
collection of open sets U ⊆R. The collection of open sets was deﬁned in terms of
Bε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y| < ε}, thus still directly using the absolute value function.
It would thus seem that we had accomplished nothing except for hiding the absolute
value function in some fancy notation. However, something quite substantial was
achieved. Consider the scaled absolute value function |x|2 = 2 · |x|, and let us
deﬁne
B2,ε(x) = {y ∈R | |x −y|2 < ε} = (x −ε
2, x + ε
2)

80

Topological Spaces
for all x ∈R and ε > 0. Let us further say that a set U ⊆R is 2-open if for all x ∈U
there exists an ε > 0 such that B2,ε(x) ⊆U. In other words, we repeat the deﬁnition
of open sets, replacing the absolute value function by a scaled version of it.
Proposition 3.2 The collection of open sets and the collection of 2-open sets are
the same.
Proof Notice that
Bε/4(x) ⊆B2,ε(x) ⊆Bε(x)
holds for all x ∈R and ε > 0. Thus, if U is an open set and x ∈U, then
Bε(x) ⊆U
for some ε > 0, but then
B2,ε(x) ⊆Bε(x) ⊆U
and so U is also 2-open. Conversely, if U is 2-open and x ∈U, then
B2,ε(x) ⊆U
for some ε > 0, but then
Bε/4(x) ⊆B2,ε(x) ⊆U
and so U is also open.
□
Similarly, one may show that the collection of open sets is insensitive to other changes
in the absolute value function, such as scaling by other factors or various truncations.
It is not a coincidence that those changes to the absolute value function that are
immaterial to the notion of continuity are also immaterial to the concept of open set.
Indeed, Theorem 3.2 characterizes continuity in terms of the open sets alone.
Thus, by concentrating on the open sets one is freed from the irrelevant (for the
purposes of continuity) particularities of the absolute value function. The deﬁnition
of a topology is thus an abstraction of a particular formulation of continuity which
avoids directly mentioning any particular concept of R which is irrelevant to the
notion of continuity. As with any abstraction, once it is made, a plethora of new
situations emerges, situations that superﬁcially have little or nothing to do with the
geometric notion of continuity. Introducing a topology on a set immediately allows
one to import a signiﬁcant amount of geometric intuition, machinery, and analogy
into an a-priori non-geometric context.

3.1.2 More Examples
We present more topological spaces, illustrating the versatility of the formalism. We
remark that there are far more interesting examples of topological spaces than can
be recounted in this book. The choice of the examples given below is dictated by the
focus of the book; the examples are chosen to elucidate the forthcoming topological
concepts, while avoiding delving into the intricacies of the more obscure examples of
topological spaces, thus allowing the reader to ease into the topological framework
while remaining ﬁrmly grounded in analysis.
Example 3.1 (Discrete And Indiscrete Topologies) Any set X supports two extreme
topologies on it. One is the collection {∅, X}, called the indiscrete topology on X
and the other is the collection of all subsets of X, called the discrete topology on X.
It is immediate to verify that these are indeed topologies, and that they are distinct
topologies except when |X| ≤1.
Example 3.2 (The Sierpinski Space) Let S = {0, 1} be a set with two elements. The
collection
{∅, S, {1}}
is readily seen to be a topology on S giving rise to what is known as the Sierpinski
space.
Example 3.3 Let X = {a, b, c, d, e} be a nonempty set consisting of ﬁve elements.
Of the collections
τ = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d, e}}
G = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {b, c, d}}
H = {X, ∅, {a}, {c, d}, {a, c, d}, {a, b, d, e}}
τ is a topology on X as the axioms are easily conﬁrmed by inspection. G is not a
topology on X, since {a} ∪{b, c, d} = {a, b, c, d} /∈G. The collection H is also not
a topology on X, since {c, d} ∩{a, b, d, e} = {d} /∈H.
Example 3.4 (The Coﬁnite and Cocountable Topologies) Let X be a set and τ the
family of all subsets U of X whose complement X −U is ﬁnite, and if needed,
manually include ∅in τ. We show that τ is a topology on X. First, ∅∈τ by
deﬁnition, and since X −X = ∅is ﬁnite, it follows that X ∈τ, and so the ﬁrst
condition in the deﬁnition of topology is satisﬁed. Stability under arbitrary unions is
immediate, so ﬁnally consider two sets U1,U2 with ﬁnite complements in X. Since
X −(U1 ∩U2) = (X −U1) ∪(X −U2)
and since both (X −U1) and (X −U2) are ﬁnite, it follows that U1 ∩U2 has ﬁnite
complement too. This topology is called the coﬁnite topology on X. Notice that if

82
3
Topological Spaces
X is ﬁnite, then the coﬁnite topology coincides with the discrete topology on X
(Example 3.1).
Similarly, call a subsetU ⊆X cocountable if its complement X −U is a countable
set. The collection of all cocountable subsets of X (with ∅added in manually) also
forms a topology on X called the cocountable topology. The proof is similar to
the proof given above, with the necessary care when handling countable sets (see
Sect.1.2.13 of the Preliminaries).
3.1.3 Elementary Observations
We explore some immediate properties of topological spaces and of continuous
functions, and we discuss the notion of homeomorphism. We start off with a useful
criterion for detecting open sets in any topological space.
Proposition 3.3 A subset V of a topological space X is open if, and only if, for all
x ∈V there exists an open set Ux such that
x ∈Ux ⊆V.
Proof If V is open, then clearly for every x ∈V one may choose Ux = V . In the
other direction, the stated condition implies that
V =

x∈V
Ux
and so V is expressed as the union of open sets, and is thus itself open.
□
Proposition 3.4 The composition g ◦f : X →Z of any two continuous functions
X
f
 Y
g
 Z between topological spaces is itself continuous.
Proof Given an open set U in Z, we need to verify that (g ◦f )−1(U) is open in X.
Indeed,
(g ◦f )−1(U) = f −1(g−1(U))
and since g is continuous it follows that g−1(U) is open in Y, and since f , too, is
continuous it follows that f −1(g−1(U)) is open in X.
□
Proposition 3.5 Given two topologies, τ1 and τ2, on the same set X, the identity
function id : (X, τ1) →(X, τ2) is continuous if, and only if, τ2 ⊆τ1.
Proof Notice that for the identity function id : X →X and any subset U ⊆X (open
or not) one has id−1(U) = U. Thus, the condition for continuity is precisely that
U ∈τ1 for all U ∈τ2, in other words, that τ2 ⊆τ1.
□

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
83
Deﬁnition 3.4 Given two topologies τ1 and τ2 on the same set X, if τ1 ⊆τ2, then
τ1 is said to be coarser than τ2 while τ2 is said to be ﬁner than τ1.
Notice that the discrete topology on X is the ﬁnest topology among all topologies on
X while the indiscrete topology is the coarsest one. In general, different topologies
on the same set may be incomparable, i.e. one need not be contained in the other.
Deﬁnition 3.5 A function f : X →Y between topological spaces is said to be
a homeomorphism if f is bijective and both f : X →Y and f −1 : Y →X are
continuous functions. If there exists a homeomorphism between X and Y, then X
and Y are said to be homeomorphic spaces.
Remark 3.2 One should not confuse between the terms homeomorphism and
homomorphism. The term homomorphism in algebra is typically used to indicate
a structure preserving function, with isomorphism used for the invertible structure
preserving functions. In topology, the structure preserving functions are precisely
the continuous functions, and the invertible structure preserving functions are called
homeomorphisms.
Note that f : X →Y is a homeomorphism if, and only if, for all U ⊆Y
f −1(U) ∈τX ⇐⇒U ∈τY .
Homeomorphic spaces thus have essentially the same collections of open sets, up to
a renaming of the elements. Intuitively, two spaces are homeomorphic if one can be
continuously changed, without gluing or tearing, to obtain the other. While homeo-
morphic spaces must have the same cardinality (since a homeomorphism is in partic-
ular a bijection), the converse quite often fails since both the bijection and its inverse
must be continuous. For instance, the circumference of a circle and a line segment
(say in R2) have the same cardinality, but they are not homeomorphic. This is intu-
itively quite clear since (it would appear that) the only way to create the hole that the
circle encloses is to glue the two ends of the line segment, but that changes the topol-
ogy (i.e. glueing is a continuous operation but its inverse, tearing, is not). However,
turning such intuitive arguments into formal ones is usually not straightforward.
Generally speaking, it can be quite tricky to prove that two topological spaces
are not homeomorphic. A common technique in establishing such a result is the
following one. A property P about topological spaces is said to be a topological
invariant if for all homeomorphic topological spaces X and Y, X has property P
precisely when Y does. To show that two spaces are not homeomorphic, it thus
sufﬁces to ﬁnd a topological invariant that only one of the two spaces possesses. The
topological concepts introduced in the rest of this chapter often provide one with a
suitable topological invariant.

3.1.4 Closed Sets
With every subset S of a set X one may associate the complementary set Sc = X −S,
giving rise to a bijective operation P(X) →P(X) on the set P(X) of all subsets
of X. It is thus clear that any concept given in terms of subsets of X gives rise, by
taking complements, to what must essentially be an equivalent concept. This general
observation holds for the deﬁnition of a topology, and we now devote some time to
the relevant details.
We ﬁrst observe that the Sierpinski space S = {0, 1} from Example 3.2 can be
used to identify the open sets in an arbitrary topological space.
Proposition 3.6 There exists a bijective correspondence between the open sets of a
topological space X and continuous functions f : X →S.
Proof Recall (e.g. Sect.1.2.10 of the Preliminaries) that with every subset S ⊆X
one may associate the indicator function
fS(x) =

1
if x ∈S
0
if x /∈S
and that this correspondence is a bijection between all subsets of X and all functions
X →S. Now, for fS : X →S to be continuous, the inverse image of every open set
in S, namely the sets ∅, S, and {1}, must be open in X. The set f −1
S (∅) = ∅is always
open in X and similarly so is f −1
S (S) = X. So, the only further condition imposed
by continuity is that f −1
S ({1}) must be open too, and since the latter set is precisely
S, we see that continuous functions f : X →S correspond bijectively to the open
subsets of X.
□
Clearly, every function f : X →S is equally well completely determined by the
inverse image of 0 instead of the inverse image of 1. We thus see that there is also a
correspondence between continuous functions f : X →S and the complements of
the open sets in X, giving rise to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.6 A subset F of a topological space X is said to be closed provided its
complement X −F is open.
The preceding discussion implies that a topology can be speciﬁed by the collection
of closed sets. The details are given in the following result.
Theorem 3.4 Let X be an arbitrary set. A given collection F of subsets of X is
the collection of closed sets for some topology on X if, and only if, the following
conditions hold.
1. Both the empty set ∅and the entire set X are members of F.
2. F is stable under ﬁnite unions. That is, if F1, . . . , Fm are members of F, then
F1 ∪· · · ∪Fm ∈F.

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
85
3. F is stable under arbitrary intersections. That is, if {Fi}i∈I are members of F,
then

i∈I
Fi ∈F.
Moreover, a collection F satisfying the conditions above is the collection of closed
sets for a unique topology on X.
Proof Applying De Morgan’s Laws (see Sect.1.2.5 of the Preliminaries), the details
arestraightforwardandareleft tothereader. Weonlystress out herethat thecollection
{X −F | F ∈F}.
is the unique topology determined by F.
□
Example 3.5 If a set X is given the discrete topology, then every subset of it is closed,
while if X is given the indiscrete topology, then the only closed subsets of X are ∅
and X itself. In the Sierpinski space S = {0, 1}, the closed sets are: ∅, S, {0}.
Example 3.6 Consider R with the Euclidean topology (Deﬁnition 3.3). It is easy to
verify that for a, b ∈R with a < b, the open interval (a, b) is an open set and the
closed interval [a, b] is a closed set. The open rays (a, ∞) and (−∞, a) are also
open sets, and the closed rays [a, ∞) and (−∞, a] are closed sets. Every singleton
set {a} is a closed set. Consequently, every ﬁnite set F ⊆R is closed.
Remark 3.3 It should be emphasized that in general an arbitrary union of closed
sets need not be closed nor does an arbitrary intersection of open sets need be open.
For instance, consider R with the Euclidean topology (Deﬁnition 3.3). Since every
singleton set {x} is closed, every subset X ⊆R is the union of closed sets, i.e.
X =

x∈X
{x}
but, of course, not every subset of R is closed. Similarly, for any x ∈R, one has
{x} =

ε>0
(x −ε, x + ε)
showing that {x} is an intersection of open sets, but is itself not open.
Remark 3.4 It is important to realize that a set is not a door. A set need not be open
nor closed, while it may be both open and closed. For instance, consider the topology
τ from Example 3.3. One easily veriﬁes that {a, c} is not closed nor open and that
{a} is both closed and open. Sets that are both closed and open are said to be clopen.
Notice that the empty set ∅and X itself are clopen in any topological space. If these
are the only clopen sets in X, than X is said to be connected, a property we explore
further in Sect.3.4.

Topological Spaces
The dual nature of open and closed sets is seen in the following result. Recall that a
function f : X →Y between topological spaces is continuous if f −1(U) is open in
X for every open set U in X.
Theorem 3.5 A function f : X →Y between topological spaces is continuous if,
and only if, f −1(F) is a closed set in X for every closed set F in Y.
The proof is, as it should be, a tautology that the reader is urged to clarify for herself.
The duality between open and closed sets is quite helpful since while dual to each
other, open and closed sets have different topological qualities and thus it may be
easier to establish a result in terms of closed sets rather than open ones, or vice versa.
The reader should be warned though that not all concepts that may appear dual are
in fact dual.
Deﬁnition 3.7 A function f : X →Y between topological spaces is
• an open mapping if f (U) is open in Y for every open set U in X.
• a closed mapping if f (F) is closed in Y for every closed set F in X.
The reader is invited to ﬁnd examples of open mappings that are not closed as well
as closed ones that are not open.
3.1.5 Bases and Subbases
Generally speaking, a topology is a very large collection of subsets. For instance, the
Euclidean topology on R has uncountably many open sets. It is thus often desirable
to obtain smaller (or at least more manageable) collections that give one access to
the entire topology. This is what bases and subbases are designed to achieve.
Deﬁnition 3.8 A collection B of open sets in a topological space X is a basis (or
a base) for the topology τX if for every open set U ⊆X and x ∈U, there exists an
element B ∈B such that
x ∈B ⊆U.
The elements of B are called basis elements.
Example 3.7 For every topological space (X, τX), the collection B = τX is, quite
trivially, a basis. More interestingly, the collection {Bε(x) | x ∈R, ε > 0} is a basis
for the Euclidean topology on R. Indeed, if U ⊆R is open, then, by deﬁnition, for
each x ∈U there is an ε > 0 such that
x ∈Bε(x) ⊆U.
If X is an arbitrary set endowed with the indiscrete topology, then the collection {X}
is a basis. Indeed, there are at most two open sets in the indiscrete topology, namely
∅and X. So if U is open and x ∈U, then necessarily U = X and clearly

3.1 Topology—Deﬁnition and Elementary Results
87
x ∈X ⊆X.
If X is endowed with the discrete topology, then the collection {{x} | x ∈X} of all
singleton subsets of X is a basis. Indeed, in the discrete topology every U ⊆X is
open, and if x ∈U, then clearly
x ∈{x} ⊆U.
Deﬁnition 3.9 A collection A of open sets in a topological space X is a subbasis
for the topology if the collection {A1 ∩· · · ∩Am | A1, . . . , Am ∈A , m ≥0} of all
ﬁnite intersections of elements of A is a basis for the topology.
Remark 3.5 By convention, the empty intersection (i.e. the case m = 0 above) is
interpreted to be the set X itself.
Example 3.8 Consider the set of real numbers R with the Euclidean topology. The
collection
{(a, ∞) | a ∈R} ∪{(−∞, b) | b ∈R}
of all open rays is a subbasis. Indeed, the open rays are open sets and since
Bε(a) = (a −ε, ∞) ∩(−∞, a + ε)
we see that the collection of all ﬁnite intersections of the open rays contains the
basis we presented above. It follows that the collection is a basis since, in general, if
B′ ⊇B are collections of open sets and B is a basis, then so is B′.
We now show that bases can be used directly to detect continuity of functions.
Proposition 3.7 Let f : X →Y be a function between topological spaces and let
B be a basis for the topology on Y. Then f is continuous if, and only if, f −1(B) is
open in X for all basis elements B ∈B.
Proof If f is continuous, then f −1(U) is open for all open sets U ⊆Y. Since any
B ∈B is in particular an open set in Y, it follows that f −1(B) is open in X. In the
other direction, assume that f −1(B) is open for all B ∈B and let U be an arbitrary
open set in Y. It follows at once from the deﬁnition of basis that we may express U
as a union of basis elements
U =

x∈U
Bx.
It then holds that
f −1(U) =

x∈U
f −1(Bx)
and since each f −1(Bx) is assumed open, the set f −1(U) is thus expressed as the
union of open sets, and so is open. Thus f −1(U) is open for all open sets U in Y,
and thus f is continuous.

Topological Spaces
We close this section by introducing a local variant of the notion of basis.
Deﬁnition 3.10 Let X be a topological space and x ∈X. A collection B of open
subsets of X is said to be a local basis at x if for all B ∈B
x ∈B
and if for every open set U in X with x ∈U, there is an element Bx ∈B (called a
basis element) with
Bx ⊆U.
Every basis B for the topology on X clearly gives rise to the local basis
Bx = {B ∈B | x ∈B}
at x. It is also the case that if for every x ∈X one has a local basis Bx at x, then the
collection
B =

x∈X
Bx
is a basis for the topology on X. We leave the veriﬁcation of these simple claims to
the reader.

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
This section introduces geometric notions regarding various possible relationships
between a point and a set in a topological space. We also consider countability axioms
and study the consequences they entail for some of these notions.
3.2.1 Subspaces and Point-Set Relationships
Any subset of a topological space naturally inherits a topology and thus one may
speak of subspaces, which we discuss ﬁrst. Next, various qualitative aspects of a
given point and a subset of a topological space are introduced and some basic results
are established.
Deﬁnition 3.11 (Subspace Topology) Let (X, τX) be a topological space and Y ⊆X
a subset. The collection
τY = {U ∩Y | U ∈τX}
is (easily seen to be) a topology on Y called the subspace topology. The topological
space (Y, τY ) is called a topological subspace of (X, τX), or simply a subspace if
the topological context is clear.
Proposition 3.8 The subspace topology on a subset Y of a topological space X is
the smallest topology on Y making the inclusion function i : Y →X continuous.
Proof Noticing that
i−1(U) = Y ∩U
for all U ⊆X one sees that the inclusion function i : Y →X is continuous precisely
if Y ∩U is open in Y whenever U ⊆X is open in X. This condition clearly holds for
the subspace topology τY on Y. Further, if τ is any topology on Y, then the condition
that i : Y →X is continuous with respect to the topologies τ on Y and τX on X
amounts to the condition
U ∈τX =⇒U ∩Y ∈τ,

90

Topological Spaces
and thus that τY ⊆τ, proving the minimality claim of the subspace topology τY . □
Given a subset and a point in a topological space, the open sets may be used to
identify the qualitative relative location of the point in relation to the set. This is the
subject of the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.12 Let X be a topological space, S ⊆X a subset, and x ∈X a point.
1. x is an interior point of S if there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆S.
2. x is an exterior point of S if there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆X −S.
3. x is a boundary point of S if every open set U that contains x, contains elements
in S as well as elements in X −S.
4. x is a cluster point or an accumulation point of S, if every open set U which
contains x, contains elements of S −{x}.
5. x is an isolated point of S, if {x} is an open set.
Example 3.9 Let us consider the space R with its Euclidean topology. It is easily
seen that for S = [a, b], a closed interval, as well as S = (a, b), an open interval:
1. A point x is interior precisely when a < x < b.
2. A point x is exterior precisely when either x < a or x > b.
3. A point x is a boundary point precisely when x = a or x = b.
4. A point x is a cluster point precisely when a ≤x ≤b.
5. S has no isolated points, but the space S = [0, 1] ∪{2}, as a subspace of R with
the Euclidean topology, admits the point x = 2 as its only isolated point.
Further, in R with the Euclidean topology, it is easy to see that every real number x
is a cluster point of the subset Q of rational numbers. In general, an isolated point
x is never a cluster point of any set S, simply since for the open set U = {x} one
always has U ∩(S −{x}) = ∅.
Deﬁnition 3.13 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset.
1. The interior of S is the set int(S) = {x ∈X | x is an interior point of S}.
2. The exterior of S is the set ext(S) = {x ∈X | x is an exterior point of S}.
3. The boundary of S is the set ∂(S) = {x ∈X | x is a boundary point of S}.
4. The derived set of S is the set S′ = {x ∈X | x is a cluster point of S}.
5. The closure of S is the set S = S ∪S′.
Proposition 3.9 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset. It then holds
that
1. The interior int(S) is the union of all open sets contained in S.
2. The exterior ext(S) is the union of all open sets disjoint from S.
3. The closure S is the intersection of all closed sets that contain S.
4. S = S ∪∂(S).

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
91
Proof
1. Let U be the set of all open sets U ⊆X with U ⊆S, and let
W =

U∈U
U.
We need to show that W = int(S). If x ∈W, then X ∈U for some U ∈U , and
since x ∈U ⊆S we may conclude that x ∈int(S). Conversely, if x ∈int(S),
then there exists an open set U such that x ∈U ⊆S, and thus x ∈W.
2. Notice that ext(S) = int(X −S), and now apply 1.
3. Let F be the set of all closed sets F ⊆X with S ⊆F, and let
G =

F∈F
F.
We need to show that G = S. Let x ∈G, and thus x ∈F for all F ∈F, and
our aim is to show that x ∈S. If x ∈S, then x ∈S ∪S′ = S so we may proceed
under the assumption that x /∈S. We will show that in this case x ∈S′. Indeed,
let U ⊆X be an open set with x ∈U and suppose that U ∩(S −{x}) = ∅, which
simpliﬁes to U ∩S = ∅since x /∈S. But then the closed set F = X −U contains
S, and thus x ∈F, contradicting the fact that x ∈U. In the other direction,
suppose that x ∈S = S ∪S′, and we aim to show that x ∈G, namely that x ∈F
for every closed set F with S ⊆F. If x ∈S, then clearly x ∈F, and we may thus
proceed under the assumption that x /∈S, and thus that x ∈S′. Consider the open
set U = X −F and note that U ∩(S −{x}) = U ∩S = ∅. If x /∈F, then x ∈U
and we obtain a contradiction with x ∈S′. It follows that x ∈F, as needed.
4. To show that S ⊆S ∪∂S, suppose that x ∈S but x /∈S. Given an open set U
with x ∈U, it follows that U ∩S ̸= ∅. Since x /∈S, namely x ∈X −S, we also
have that x ∈U ∩(X −S). In other words, any open set containing x, contains
points from S as well as from X −S, thus x is a boundary point of S. In the other
direction, suppose that x ∈S ∪∂S, and we need to show that x ∈S = S ∪S′.
If x ∈S, then clearly x ∈S so assume that x /∈S, and thus x ∈∂S. But then if
U is an open set containing x, then U contains a point from S (and from X −S,
though this is irrelevant here), but then U ∩(S −{x}) ̸= ∅since x /∈S. Thus x
is a cluster point, as needed.
□
Corollary 3.1 Let X be a topological space, and S ⊆X a subset. Then
1. The interior int(S) is the largest open set in X that is contained in S. In particular,
int(S) is open.
2. S is open in X if, and only if, S = int(S). In other words, S is open precisely
when all its points are interior.
3. The exterior ext(S) is the largest open set in X that is disjoint from S. In particular,
ext(S) is open.
4. S is closed in X if, and only if, X −S = ext(S).

92

Topological Spaces
5. The closure S is the smallest closed set in X that contains S. In particular, S is
closed.
6. S is closed in X if, and only if, S′ ⊆S (equivalently, if S = S).
3.2.2 Sequences and Convergence
We now turn to look at sequences in topological spaces, what it means for such
sequences to converge, and how this notion relates to the topological concepts given
above.
Deﬁnition 3.14 Let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence of points in a topological space X. A
point x0 ∈X is said to be a limit of the sequence {xm}m≥1 if for every open set
U ⊆X with x0 ∈U, there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈U.
The sequence is then said to converge to x0 and to be a convergent sequence.
Just as continuity of functions can be detected using a basis, so can cluster points
and limit points be so detected.
Proposition 3.10 In a topological space X with a local basis B at a point x0:
1. x0 is a cluster point of a subset S ⊆X if, and only if, B ∩(S −{x0}) ̸= ∅, for all
basis elements B ∈B.
2. A sequence {xm}m≥1 converges to x0 if, and only if, for every B ∈B there exists
an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈B.
Proof We only prove the ﬁrst assertion, as the two proofs are very similar. If x0 is a
cluster point and B ∈B is a basis element, then, in particular, B is open and x0 ∈B,
which implies that B ∩(S −{x0}) ̸= ∅. Conversely, suppose the stated condition
holds and let U be an arbitrary open set with x0 ∈U. By deﬁnition of basis at a
point, there exists a basis element B ∈B with x0 ∈B ⊆U. By hypothesis then
B ∩(S −{x0}) ̸= ∅and since U ∩(S −{x0}) ⊇B ∩(S −{x0}), the proof is
complete.
□
Example 3.10 Consider the Euclidean topology on R and recall that a local basis at
x0 is given by {Bε(x0)}ε>0. Thus, a sequence {xm}m≥1 in R converges to x0 ∈R if,
and only if, for every ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈Bε(x0),
or, in other words: if m > N, then |xm −x| < ε. We thus see that convergence in
the topological sense given above is equivalent to convergence of sequences in R in
the usual sense.

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
93
It is very reassuring that the notion of convergence can be captured topologically, but
one should be cautious not to expect the familiar behaviour of limits in R to remain
valid in arbitrary topological spaces, as the following example illustrates.
Example 3.11 Let X be an arbitrary set endowed with the indiscrete topology. Since
the only open sets are ∅and X, it follows immediately that any sequence {xm}m≥1 in
X converges and that any element x ∈X is a limit. Consequently, a sequence may
converge to more than one point; uniqueness of limits is lost.
Given a subset S of a topological space X, we can entertain (at least) two reasonable
formalizations for the informal idea of the set of all points that are inﬁnitesimally
close to S. One possibility is given by the closure S = S ∪S′, where we adjoin to
S all of its derived points. A second possibility is obtained by considering the set of
all limit points of sequences in S. A-priorly it is not clear how these two possibilities
compare, and we now turn to investigate this question. We limit the discussion just
to the point of developing enough theory to suit the needs of this book. It should
be noted that this is just the tip of the iceberg. The important observation is that,
generally, sequences do not sufﬁce to capture cluster points (but either nets or ﬁlters,
two concepts we will not discuss, do). Having said that, we do identify below a broad
enough class of topological spaces in which the limit behaviour is more intuitive,
namely spaces satisfying the ﬁrst countability axiom.
Theorem 3.6 Let X be a topological space and S ⊆X a subset. If a non-eventually-
constant sequence {sm}m≥1 in S converges to x0 ∈X, then x0 is a cluster point of
the subset S.
Proof Suppose that U is an open set and x0 ∈U. Since {sm}m≥1 converges to x0,
there exists an N ∈N such that sm ∈U for all m > N, and since the sequence is not
eventually constant, an m > N exists with sm ̸= x0. In particular, U ∩(S−{x0}) ̸= ∅,
and thus x0 is a cluster point of S.
□
Theorem 3.7 If f : X →Y is a continuous function between topological spaces
and xm →x0 in X, then f (xm) →f (x0) in Y.
Proof Given an open set U ⊆Y with f (x0) ∈U, we have that x0 ∈f −1(U) and
thus there exists an N ∈N such that
m > N =⇒xm ∈f −1(U)
and thus
m > N =⇒f (xm) ∈U
as required.
□
Remark 3.6 The converses of these two theorems are generally false. To see that, it

Topological Spaces
3.2.3 Second Countable and First Countable Spaces
We present now two axioms out of a class of properties called countability axioms.
The conditions we present are quite strong, and have pleasant consequences as we
will see (particularly to the behaviour of limits and cluster points). While many
topological spaces fail to satisfy either of the countability axioms we present, the
class of those that do is broad enough to supply one with plenty of spaces that
topologically are closer to one’s intuition than their wilder topological cousins are.
Deﬁnition 3.15 A topological space X satisﬁes the second axiom of countability or
is said to be second countable if there is a countable basis for the topology on X.
Thus, second countability means that there exist a countable index set I and a family
{Ui}i∈I of open sets in X such that any set U can be expressed as
U =

j∈JU
U j
for some JU ⊆I.
Example 3.12 The space R with the Euclidean topology is second countable. To
see that, we exhibit a countable basis for the topology, namely the collection
{B1/n(q)}q∈Q,n≥1. First, note that this is a countable collection, as it is indexed
by the set Q × (N −{0}) (see, e.g., Sect.1.2.13 of the Preliminaries). Next, given
an open set U ⊆R and a point x ∈U, there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ(x) ⊆U,
and let n ∈N satisfy 1/n < δ/2. Since the rationals are dense in the reals, we
may ﬁnd a rational number q for which |x −q| < 1/n. It now easily follows that
x ∈B1/n(q) ⊆Bδ(x) ⊆U, as required by the deﬁnition of basis.
Deﬁnition 3.16 A subset S ⊆X in a topological space is said to be dense in X if
S = X. The space X is called separable if it contains a countable dense subset.
A familiar example of a separable topological space is R with the Euclidean
topology. Indeed, it is easily veriﬁed that the countable set Q is dense in R. In fact,
R is also seen to be separable by the following general result.
Theorem 3.8 Every second countable space X is separable.
Proof Let B be a countable basis for the topology. For each B ∈B choose an
arbitrary point xB ∈B (if B = ∅, simply skip it). The set S = {xB | B ∈B} is
clearly countable so it remains to show that it is dense. Indeed, ﬁx a point x ∈X. To
show that x is in the closure of S suppose x /∈S and let U be an open set with x ∈U.
We now need to show that U ∩(S −{x}) ̸= ∅. Indeed, by deﬁnition, there exists
a basis element B with x ∈B ⊆U. But then xb must be found in U ∩(S −{x}),
establishing the claim.
□
Many spaces of interest are not second countable but they do satisfy a (considerably)
weaker condition known as the ﬁrst axiom of countability. Such spaces, as we will
shortly see, exhibit a general behaviour that in some respect is quite close to what
our intuition about convergence and closures in R dictates.

3.2 Subspaces, Point-Set Relationships, and Countability Axioms
95
Deﬁnition 3.17 A topological space X satisﬁes the ﬁrst axiom of countability or is
said to be ﬁrst countable if there exists, at every point x ∈X, a countable local basis.
Evidently a second countable space is also ﬁrst countable, but not, generally, vice
versa.
Recall that the converses of theorems 3.6, and 3.7 are not generally true in arbitrary
topological spaces. For ﬁrst countable spaces however, we have the following pleas-
ing result.
Theorem 3.9 Let X be a ﬁrst countable space, that is, at each point x0 ∈X there
exists a countable local basis Bx0 = {Bx
m}m≥1 at x0.
1. For a subset S ⊆X, a point x0 ∈X is in S if, and only if, sm →x0 for a sequence
{sm}m≥1 in S.
2. A subset F ⊆X is closed if, and only if, F contains all limit points of sequences
in it.
3. A function f : X →Y to any topological space Y is continuous if, and only if, it
preserves limits of sequences, i.e.,
xm →x0 =⇒f (xm) →f (x0)
for all sequences {xm}m≥1 in X.
Proof
1. By Theorem 3.6, every limit point of a non-eventually constant sequence in S is
a cluster point of S, and thus is in S. The limits of eventually constant sequences
are, of course, in S and thus also in S. Suppose now that x0 ∈X is in S and, of
course, the interesting case is when x0 /∈S. In that case x0 is a cluster point of
S. Therefore, for every m ≥1 the open set Bx0
1 ∩· · · ∩Bx0
m intersects S −{x0}
non-trivially, and let sm be an arbitrary element in the intersection. Clearly the
sequence {sm}m≥1 is in S and its limit is x0. Indeed, given any open set U ⊆X
with x0 ∈U, there exist a basis element Bx0
N with x0 ∈Bx0
N ⊆U. But then
m > N =⇒sm ∈Bx0
m ⊆Bx0
N ⊆U.
2. By Corollary 3.1, F is closed if, and only if, F = F, and we just proved that the
elements of F coincide with limit points of sequences in F.
3. By Theorem 3.7, if f : X →Y is continuous, then it preserves limits of
sequences. Suppose thus that f : X →Y preserves limits of sequences, and our
aim is to show that f is continuous. We need to show that f −1(U) is open when-
ever U ⊆Y is open, or (equivalently!) that f −1(F) is closed whenever F ⊆Y is
closed. It sufﬁces to show that f −1(F) contains its limit points, so suppose that
xm →x0
in X with {xm}m≥1 a sequence in f −1(F), and we will show that x0 ∈f −1(F).
Indeed, f preserves limits of sequences and thus f (xm) →f (x0), but then f (x0)

96

Topological Spaces
is a limit point of a sequence in F, and since the latter is closed, Theorem 3.6
implies that f (x0) ∈F, showing that x0 ∈f −1(F).

countability?
3.3 Constructing Topologies
In this section we discuss two ways of constructing topologies. The ﬁrst situation is
where one has an arbitrary set and a collection of subsets of it that one would like to
have as the open sets in a topology on X. The second scenario concerns a collection
of functions one would like to force to be continuous. This construction is used to
obtain products, coproducts, and quotients for topological spaces.

3.3 Constructing Topologies
97
3.3.1 Generating Topologies
We have seen above that it is at times convenient to have a manageable basis for
a topology since one can effectively work with the basis elements rather than the
entire topology. Given an arbitrary set X, without any prior notion of topology, and
a collection B of subsets of X, it is natural to ask whether there exists a topology τ
on X for which B is a basis, and, if such a topology exists, is it unique. The answers
are quite decisive.
Theorem 3.10 (Basis Generating Topology) A collection B of subsets of a set X is
a basis for a topology τ on X if, and only if, the following conditions are met.
1. For every x ∈X there exists a B ∈B such that x ∈B. Equivalently,
X =

B∈B
B.
2. For all B1, B2 ∈B, if x ∈B1 ∩B2, then there exists B3 ∈B such that
x ∈B3 ⊆B1 ∩B2.
Moreover, when the conditions are met, the topology τ is unique, namely τ is the
smallest topology on X such that every B ∈B is open.
Proof Let us call a subset U ⊆X open if for every x ∈U there exists a B ∈B
such that
x ∈B ⊆U.
Equivalently, U ⊆X is open if U is a union of elements from B. We show that
the collection τ of all such open sets forms a topology on X. The empty set ∅is
vacuously open since it has no points, and the set X itself is open by condition 1.
Stability under arbitrary unions is straightforward, so let us establish stability under
ﬁnite intersections. Let U1,U2 ⊆X be open and we need to show that U = U1 ∩U2
is open. Indeed, if x ∈U, then x ∈U1 and thus there is a B1 ∈B such that
x ∈B1 ⊆U1. Similarly, there is a B2 ∈B with x ∈B2 ⊆U2. As x ∈B1 ∩B2,
condition 2 gives us an element B3 ∈B with
x ∈B3 ⊆B1 ∩B2 ⊆U1 ∩U2 = U,
as needed.
The claim that B is a basis for τ is immediate from the construction. As for the
minimality claim about τ, note that if τ ′ is any topology on X for which all B ∈B
are open, then any U ∈τ, being a union of elements from B, must also be open in
τ ′. In other words, τ ⊆τ ′. The uniqueness of τ now follows too.
□

Topological Spaces
We may now pose the exact same question as above, replacing basis by subbasis.
Thus, given an arbitrary collection B of subsets of X, is there a topology τ on X for
which B is a subbasis, and is this topology unique.
Theorem 3.11 (Subbasis Generating Topology) A collection B of subsets of a set
X is a subbasis for a topology τ on X if, and only if,

B∈B
B = X.
Moreover, in that case the topology τ is unique, namely τ is the smallest topology
on X such that every B ∈B is open.
Proof One may reduce the proof to that of the previous result by noting that the
collection
B′ = {B1 ∩· · · ∩Bm | B1, . . . , Bm ∈B, m ≥0},
consisting of all ﬁnite intersections of elements of B, does satisfy the conditions
of being a basis for a topology, and thus the previous result may be applied to B′,
giving rise to a topology τ. In other words, we declare a subset U ⊆X to be open
if it is an arbitrary union of ﬁnite intersections of elements from B. The details are
left to the reader.
□
The results above, and their proofs, provide one with powerful tools for creating
topologies. Any topology constructed from a collection B by the above techniques
is said to be generated by B.
The following quite general result is used often to produce interesting topologies.
The result states, roughly, that given any collection of functions with a common
domain or codomain, a canonical topology exists rendering all the given functions
continuous. We remark that, in a sense, topological spaces exists as the servants
of continuous functions; we deﬁne topological spaces since we are interested in
continuous mappings. This result thus allows one to tailor a suitable topology from
a given collection of functions.
Proposition 3.11 (Topologies Induced by Functions)
1. Let X be a set and { fi : X →Xi}i∈I a non-empty collection of functions with
each Xi a topological space. There exists then a unique smallest topology on X
such that every fi : X →Xi is continuous.
2. Let X be a set and { fi : Xi →X}i∈I a non-empty collection of functions with
each Xi a topological space. There exists then a unique largest topology on X
such that every fi : Xi →X is continuous.
Proof
1. Suppose that τ is a topology on X such that each fi : X →Xi is continuous.
That means that f −1
i
(U) ∈τ for each U ∈τXi . In other words τ ⊇B where

3.3 Constructing Topologies
99
B = { f −1
i
(U) | i ∈I,U ∈τXi }
and so we see that we must deﬁne τ to be the topology generated by B. This is
feasible since B is easily seen to satisfy the condition of Theorem 3.11.
2. Suppose that τ is a topology on X such that each fi : Xi →X is continuous.
That means that τ can not contain any subset S ⊆X for which there exists an
i ∈I with f −1
i
(S) /∈τXi . So, to obtain the largest possible topology on X, we
consider the collection
τ = {S ⊆X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi for all i ∈I}.
If we can show that τ is indeed a topology, then the proof is complete. Notice that
τ =

i∈I
{S ⊆X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi }
and that (the reader is invited to prove) the intersection of a family of topologies
on X is again a topology on X. Thus we only need to establish that the collection
{S ⊆X | f −1
i
(S) ∈τXi }, for a single i ∈I, is a topology. This follows
immediately from well-known properties of the inverse image function, as the
reader may verify.
□
When a topology τ is constructed as above, we say that it is generated by the given
collection of functions. We note at once that it is quite possible that the collection of
functions consists of just one single function.
Remark 3.7 Deﬁnition 3.11 of the subspace topology on a subset Y of a topological
space X is already an example of this method of constructing topologies. Indeed,
the subspace topology is precisely the topology generated by the single function
i : Y →X, the inclusion function (see Proposition 3.8).
3.3.2 Coproducts, Products, and Quotients
The rest of this section utilizes the constructions above in three particular scenarios.
Deﬁnition 3.18 Let X and Y be topological spaces and assume X ∩Y = ∅. The
topology on X ∪Y generated by {iX : X →X ∪Y, iY : Y →X ∪Y}, where iX
and iY are the inclusion functions, is called the coproduct topology on X ∪Y, and
the space X ∪Y is called the coproduct of X and Y.
Examples are abundant, but some care is required in order to hone the intuition. For
instance, in R with the Euclidean topology, the two subspaces Q and R −Q are
clearly disjoint, so one can form their coproduct which would give a topology on R
which is not the Euclidean topology.

100

Topological Spaces
The situation easily generalizes to inﬁnitely many spaces, as follows. Suppose
{Xi}i∈I is a non-empty collection of topological spaces that are pairwise disjoint.
The coproduct of all the Xi is then the set
X =

i∈I
Xi
endowed with the topology generated by the family of inclusions {Xi →X}i∈I. As
an example, a topological space X is discrete if, and only if, it is the coproduct of its
singleton subspaces.
Deﬁnition 3.19 Let X and Y be two topological spaces, and consider the cartesian
product X × Y. The topology generated by the set of projections
{πX : X × Y →X, πY : X × Y →Y}
is called the product topology on X × Y, and the space X × Y is called the cartesian
product or simply the product of X and Y.
This situation also naturally extends to the inﬁnite case. If {Xi}i∈I is a non-empty
family of topological spaces, then their cartesian product is the set X, the set-theoretic
cartesian product of the Xi, endowed with the topology generated by the family of
projections {πi : X →Xi}i∈I.
Let us consider the case of a product of countably many spaces {Xm}m≥1. The
set-theoretic cartesian product X = X1 × · · · × Xm × · · · consists of all sequences
x = (x1, . . . , xm, . . .) with xm ∈Xm for each m ≥1. The projection πm : X →Xm
is given by πm(x) = xm. Following the deﬁnitions above, it follows that the product
topology on X is the one generated by the sets of the form U1 × · · · × Um × · · ·
where each Um is an open set in Xm and Um = Xm for all but ﬁnitely many m.
Example 3.13 A familiar example is Rn, the n-fold product of the topological space
R with itself, when given the Euclidean topology. For n ≥2 the resulting product
topology on Rn is also called the Euclidean topology. Another example is R∞as a
countable product of R with itself.
The ﬁnal construction we present is that of the quotient topology. Let X be a set with
an equivalence relation on it. Recall (e.g., Sect.1.2.15 of the Preliminaries) that there
is then the associated quotient set X/∼= {[x] | x ∈X} of all equivalence classes
[x], and the canonical projection π : X →X/∼given by π(x) = [x]. When this
situation is enriched by the presence of a topology on X, it is natural to seek out a
topology on X/∼as well. With the tools we now have, this is immediate.
Deﬁnition 3.20 Let X be a topological space and ∼an equivalence relation on the
set X. The topology on X/∼generated by the projection function π : X →X/∼is
called the quotient topology on X/∼, and the space X/∼is called the quotient of X
modulo ∼.

Example 3.14 Consider [0, 1] as a subspace of R with its standard topology. Deﬁne
the equivalence relation ∼on [0, 1] by x ∼y precisely when x = y or x, y ∈{0, 1}.
The quotient space [0, 1]/∼is homeomorphic to the space S1 = {x ∈R2 | ∥x∥= 1}
considered as a subspace of R2 with the Euclidean topology. Informally, ∼glues the
two ends of the interval [0, 1], resulting in a circle.

3.4 Separation and Connectedness
Separation properties of a topological space relate to the ability of the open sets to
separate distinct points, a point from a set, or two disjoint sets. We only consider
one such property, the Hausdorff separation property, which is the strongest of the
separation axioms pertaining to the ability to separate distinct points. We then turn
our attention to the notion of connectivity for a topological space, a notion that is
somewhat more subtle than one might initially expect.
3.4.1 The Hausdorff Separation Property
If X is endowed with the indiscrete topology, then the open sets (of which there are
only two) are, in a sense, blind to the individual points in the space. The open sets
are simply not sufﬁciently reﬁned to be able to distinguish between different points.
This is an extreme situation of course and it goes against one’s intuition of how
distinct points should (in some sense) behave. The following separation property
immediately brings some of the familiarity back.
Deﬁnition 3.21 A topological space X is said to satisfy the Hausdorff separation
property, or simply to be Hausdorff , if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist
disjoint open sets U and V such that x ∈U and y ∈V . Such open sets are said to
separate x and y.
Remark 3.8 The Hausdorff separation property is also commonly referred to as T2,
indicating its position in a hierarchy of several separation axioms, starting with T0,
the weakest one. We will not delve into this issue here.
Example 3.15 R with the Euclidean topology is Hausdorff. Indeed, if x ̸= y are real
numbers, then setting
δ = |x −y|
2
> 0
one easily sees that

3.4 Separation and Connectedness
103
Bδ(x) ∩Bδ(y) = ∅
thus clearly exhibiting open sets that separate x and y.
Example 3.16 An example of a non-Hausdorff space is given by the Sierpinski space
S = {0, 1}. Its two points clearly can not be separated, since the topology is given by
{∅, {1}, {0, 1}}. In fact, a ﬁnite topological space X is Hausdorff if, and only if, it is
discrete. Indeed any discrete space is clearly Hausdorff, since any two distinct points
x and y are separated by the open sets {x} and {y}. In the other direction, suppose X
is ﬁnite and Hausdorff, and choose some x ∈X. For each y ∈X −{x} we may ﬁnd
disjoint open sets Uy and Vy such that x ∈Uy and y ∈Vy. Then, the intersection
U =

y∈X−{x}
Uy
is an open set (this is where the ﬁniteness assumption on X is used), and it contains
x. Further, since U ⊆Uy, it follows that
U ∩Vy ⊆Uy ∩Vy = ∅
and thus U is an open set that contains x but does not contain any y ∈X −{x}.
In other words, U = {x}, and thus we proved that {x} is an open set. Since x was
arbitrary, it follows that X is discrete.
One immediate consequence of the Hausdorff property is the following result.
Theorem 3.12 A convergent sequence {xm}m≥1 in a Hausdorff space X converges
to a unique limit.
Proof Suppose that {xm}m≥1 converges to two different points x and y. There exist,
by the Hausdorff property, two disjoint open sets Ux and Uy with x ∈Ux and y ∈Yy.
By Deﬁnition 3.14, there exist Nx, Ny ∈N such that
m > Nx =⇒xm ∈Ux
m > Ny =⇒xm ∈Uy.
But then, for m > max{Nx, Ny}, we have that xm ∈Ux ∩Uy, a contradiction since
Ux and Uy are disjoint.
□
3.4.2 Path-Connected and Connected Spaces
The second property we discuss is that of connectedness which, to immediately
dispel any misconception, is not opposing the Hausdorff separation property (or any

104
3
Topological Spaces
other separation property). There are two notions to discuss—path connectivity and
connectivity—the former more immediately intuitive than the latter, and thus is the
one we present ﬁrst.
Deﬁnition 3.22 A space X is said to be path-connected if for all points x, y ∈X
there exists a continuous function γ : [0, 1] →X with γ (0) = x and γ (1) = y.
Here the topology given to the interval [0, 1] is the subspace topology induced by
the Euclidean topology on R. A continuous function γ : [0, 1] →X is naturally
thought of as a path in X with initial point γ (0) and ﬁnal destination γ (1). Thus, X is
path-connected if any two points in the space can be connected by a path in the space.
Example 3.17 The space Rn is path-connected for all n ≥1. Indeed, given points
x = (x1, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, . . . , yn), it is easily veriﬁed that γ : [0, 1] →Rn
given by
γ (t) = t(y1, . . . , yn) + (1 −t)(x1, . . . , xn)
is a path connecting x and y. The same argument shows that any subset of Rn of the
form
[a1, b1] × · · · × [an, bn],
a product of intervals, is path-connected. In particular, any interval [a, b] in R is
path-connected. More generally, any convex subset of Rn is path-connected. The
reader is invited to verify that another example of a connected space is S = {x ∈
Rn | ∥x∥= 1}, the unit sphere, viewed as a subspace of Rn with the Euclidean
topology, provided that n > 1.
An example of a space that is not path-connected is Q as a subspace of R with the
Euclidean topology. In fact, no two distinct points x, y ∈Q can be connected by a
path. To see that, one can show that any path γ : [0, 1] →Q is constant. However,
we establish the same result by utilizing the concept of connectivity which we now
turn to.
Deﬁnition 3.23 A topological space X is said to be disconnected if there exists
non-empty open sets U and V such that U ∩V = ∅and U ∪V = X. A space X is
said to be connected if it is not disconnected.
Theorem 3.13 Any closed interval [a, b], as a subspace of R with the Euclidean
topology, is connected.
Proof Without loss of generality let us assume that [a, b] = [0, 1]. Suppose that
[0, 1] is not connected. Then there exist non-empty open subsets U and V in the
subspace topology such that U ∪V = [a, b] and U ∩V = ∅. Since a singleton
set is not open in the subspace topology on [0, 1] it follows that not U nor V is a
singleton set. In particular, we may assume that there exist a ∈U and b ∈V with
0 < a < b < 1. The set S = {x ∈U | x < b} is non-empty and bounded above,
and so admits a supremum s, and notice that 0 < s < 1.

3.4 Separation and Connectedness
105
Now, since [0, 1] = U ∪V we must have that either s ∈U or s ∈V . If s ∈U then
s < b and, U being open, there exists an a′ ∈U with s < a′ < b, contrary to the
choice of s. On the other hand, if s ∈V then, V being open, there exist an ε > 0 with
(s −ε, s +ε) ⊆V , again contrary to the choice of s. The assumption of the existence
of U and V as above thus leads to a contradiction, and so [0, 1] is connected.
□
Remark 3.9 The intuition behind the concept of connectedness is perhaps better
explained by referring to the word ‘samenhangend’, the term used for this property
in the Dutch language. The literal meaning of ‘samenhangend’ is ‘hanging together’,
and it is this topological quality that the deﬁnition of connectedness captures. For
instance, it is intuitively clear that if a space is path-connected, then it must be
‘hanging together’. This is indeed the case.
Lemma 3.1 If a topological space X is path-connected, then it is connected.
Proof Supposethat X is disconnected. That means that thereexist disjoint non-empty
open sets U, V ⊆X such that
U ∪V = X.
Choose points x ∈U and y ∈V and, utilizing the assumption that the space X is
path-connected, let γ : [0, 1] →X be a path from x to y. Since γ is continuous, it
follows that γ −1(U) and γ −1(V ) are open sets in [0, 1]. Further,
γ −1(U) ∩γ −1(V ) = γ −1(U ∩V ) = γ −1(∅) = ∅
and
γ −1(U) ∪γ −1(V ) = γ −1(U ∪V ) = γ −1(X) = [0, 1].
Lastly, since x = γ (0) and x ∈U it follows that 0 ∈γ −1(U), and in particular
γ −1(U) ̸= ∅. Similarly one shows that γ −1(V ) ̸= ∅.
The conclusion is thus that γ −1(U) and γ −1(V ) separate [0, 1], a contradiction
with the fact that [0, 1] was shown to be a connected subspace of R. We conclude
that X is connected.
□
Example 3.18 We now return to the example of Q and show that it is disconnected,
and thus also not path-connected. Indeed, let α be an arbitrary irrational number and
let U = {x ∈Q | x < α} and V = {x ∈Q | x > α}. Clearly, U ∩V = ∅and
U ∪V = Q, and thus all that is left to show is that U and V are open. Indeed, given
any x ∈U, setting δ = (α −x)/2, one easily sees that (x −δ, x + δ) ∩Q ⊆U. But
this shows that U is open in the subspace topology on Q, as required. The claim that
V , too, is open follows similarly.
Theorem 3.14 If f : X →Y is a surjective continuous mapping between topolog-
ical spaces and X is connected, then so is Y.

106
3
Topological Spaces
Proof Suppose that Y is disconnected, namely that Y = U ∪V for some non-empty
open sets U, V ⊆Y which further satisfy U ∩V = ∅. Note that
X = f −1(Y) = f −1(U) ∪f −1(V )
and that both f −1(U) and f −1(V ) are open in X. Further,
f −1(U) ∩f −1(V ) = f −1(U ∩V ) = f −1(∅) = ∅.
Since X is connected, we may conclude that either f −1 (U) or f −1 (V ) is empty. But,
since f is surjective, that is impossible and we conclude that Y is connected.

3.5 Compactness
The reader is probably aware of the importance of closed intervals in R and, more
generally, of closed and bounded subsets of R or Rn. For instance, the Bolzano-
Weierstrass Theorem states that every inﬁnite sequence in a closed interval [a, b]
admits a convergent subsequence, or the theorem that a continuous function on a
closed interval is uniformly continuous. It turns out that the crucial property of these
subsets allowing for the mentioned results is a topological one, namely that these
subsets are compact. The aim of this section is to present the notion of compactness
and prove several results leading to the characterization of the closed and bounded
subsetsofR(undertheEuclideantopology)aspreciselythecompactsets.Thesection
concludes with the statement of the important result, known as Tychonoff’s Theorem,
that the product of any family of compact topological spaces is itself compact.
Deﬁnition 3.24 Let X be a topological space and C ⊆X a subset. An open covering
of C is a collection {Ui}i∈I of open sets whose union contains the entire set C, i.e.
C ⊆

i∈I
Ui.
The set C is said to be compact if given any open covering {Ui}i∈I of C, there exists
a ﬁnite subcovering of C. That is, there exists ﬁnitely many sets Ui1, . . . ,Uim from
the given covering such that
C ⊆Ui1 ∩· · · ∩Uim.
Notice that C may coincide with the set X, so we may speak of the space X itself
being compact.
Example 3.19 Any ﬁnite set C in any topological space is compact. This is clear
since any open covering of a ﬁnite set must admit a ﬁnite subcovering, using at most
as many open sets from the covering as there are points in the set C.
Example 3.20 Any unbounded set Y ⊆R, when R is given the Euclidean topology,
is not compact. To see that, consider the open covering
Y ⊆
∞

k=1
(−k, k).

108
3
Topological Spaces
Clearly, no ﬁnite subcovering sufﬁces to cover Y precisely because Y was chosen to
be unbounded. In other words, any compact set in R must be bounded. Similarly, an
open interval (a, b) is not compact in R either, since the open covering
(a, b) ⊆
∞

k=1
(a + 1
k , ∞)
admits no ﬁnite subcovering of (a, b), as is easy to verify.
Example 3.21 For any set X, if X is endowed with the indiscrete topology, then
there are only two open sets (or sometimes less) in existence and so every subset
C ⊆X is certainly compact. If, however, X is given the discrete topology, then every
singleton set {x} is open, and thus any subset C ⊆X admits the open covering
C =

x∈C
{x}
and thus is compact if, and only if, C is ﬁnite.
The next example is important enough to be stated as a theorem.
Theorem 3.15 A closed interval [a, b] in R with the Euclidean topology is compact.
Proof Suppose that an open covering {Ui}i∈I of [a, b] is given, and the goal is to
prove a ﬁnite subcovering exists. Deﬁne the set S of all a ≤s ≤b for which a ﬁnite
subcovering of [a, s] exists, and thus the goal now is to show that b ∈S. Now, since
[a, a] = {a}, which can certainly be covered by just one element from the given
covering, it follows that a ∈S, and thus S is not empty. By deﬁnition, S is bounded,
and thus has a supremum t. We will show that t = b. Firstly, take some Ui0 from the
given covering for which t ∈Ui0. As Ui0 is open, we have
t ∈(t −ε, t + ε) ⊆Ui0
for some ε > 0, and since t −ε < t it follows that t −ε ∈S. There is then a ﬁnite
subcovering of [a, t −ε], and by adjoining Ui0 to it we obtain a ﬁnite subcovering
of [a, t], and thus t ∈S, and thus a ﬁnite subcovering for [a, t] exists. But then, if
t < b, then the ﬁnite subcovering of [a, t] is (by considering the set containing t)
also a ﬁnite subcovering of [0, t + δ] for a suitable δ > 0, contrary to the minimality
of t. We thus conclude that t = b and thus that one can extract a ﬁnite subcover of
all of [a, b].
□
Generally speaking, a compact subset need not be closed, as the following example
shows.
Example 3.22 Let X be an arbitrary set and consider the coﬁnite topology on it. The
open sets (other than ∅) are those whose complements are ﬁnite, and thus we may
identify the closed sets (other than X itself) as precisely the ﬁnite subsets. We now

3.5 Compactness
109
show that any subset C ⊆X is compact. Suppose an open covering {Ui}i∈I of C
is given. To extract a ﬁnite subcovering, consider any non-empty member Ui of the
covering, and note that since it is open it misses at most ﬁnitely many of the elements
of C. Thus only ﬁnitely many other open sets from the given covering are required
to cover C, and thus a ﬁnite subcovering exists. In particular then, if X is inﬁnite,
then not every compact subset of it is closed.
Lemma 3.2 A closed subset C of a compact space X is compact.
Proof Given an open covering of C, simply note that adding to it the set X −C,
which is open since C is assumed closed, yields an open covering of X, which is
compact. A ﬁnite subcovering of X thus must exist and discarding X −C from it if
necessary yields a ﬁnite subcovering of C, as required.
□
The compact subsets of R with the Euclidean topology can be characterized as
precisely the closed and bounded sets, as we proceed to show, starting with the
following independently important result.
Proposition 3.12 A compact subset C of a Hausdorff space X is closed.
Proof If C = X, then C is closed, so we may assume X −C is not empty, and we
proceed to show that it is open. Let x0 ∈X −C be an arbitrary point. For every
y ∈C, using the Hausdorff assumption on X, there exist disjoint open sets Uy and
Vy such that x0 ∈Uy and y ∈Vy. Clearly, the collection {Vy}y∈C is an open covering
of C, and since C is compact there exists a ﬁnite subcovering Vy1, . . . , Vyk such that
C ⊆Vy1 ∪· · · ∪Vyk.
Let
U = Uy1 ∩· · · ∩Uyk
and note that U is open, that x0 ∈U, and that U ⊆C. In other words, x0 is an
interior point of X −C and since x0 was an arbitrary point, every point of X −C is
interior, and thus, by Corollary 3.1, X −C is open.
□
Theorem 3.16 (Heine-Borel) With respect to the Euclidean topology on R, a subset
C ⊆R is compact if, and only if, C is closed and bounded.
Proof Assume that C ⊆R is compact subset. Since R is Hausdorff, it follows by
Proposition 3.12 that C is closed while the fact that C must be bounded was already
noted in Example 3.20. In the other direction, if C is bounded, then it is contained
in some closed interval [a, b], which by Theorem 3.15 is a compact set. If C is also
closed then it is a closed subset of the compact set [a, b] and thus, by Lemma 3.2, is

Topological Spaces
Theorem 3.17 An inﬁnite subset S of a compact topological space X has a cluster
point in X.
Proof Suppose that S does not have any cluster points in X. That means that for
every x ∈X there exists an open set Ux with x ∈Ux and such that Ux ∩S is either
empty or the set {x}. Clearly, {Ux}x∈X is an open cover of X, and thus admits a ﬁnite
subcover, say Ux1, . . . ,Uxn, and thus
S ⊆Ux1 ∪· · · ∪Uxn.
But Uxi ∩S contains at most one element, and we thus conclude that |S| ≤n, so S is
ﬁnite. Consequently, if S is inﬁnite, then it must have at least one cluster point.

We end this section by mentioning the following important result.
Theorem 3.18 (Tychonoff Theorem) The product of any number (ﬁnite or inﬁnite)
of compact topological spaces is itself compact.
The proof of this result is slightly beyond the scope of this book.

also be non-compact. Similarly, show that a subset of a non-compact space may be
compact but may also be non-compact.

Metric Spaces
Abstract This chapter is concerned with the basic concepts of metric spaces and
results that are most relevant to applications in Hilbert space theory. Assuming no
prior knowledge of metric spaces, the deﬁnitions are given in detail and the relation
to normed spaces made explicit early on. The main theorems proved are the Banach
Fixed-Point Theorem, Baire’s Theorem, the equivalence between compact sets and
complete totally bounded sets, and an account of completion.

point Theorem · Baire’s Theorem · Cauchy condition · Metric completion · Totally
bounded space · Metric topology · Compact metric space
The concept metric space was introduced by Maurice René Fréchet in 1906 in
his Ph.D. dissertation devoted to functional analysis. The axioms given by Fréchet
(which are almost identical to the ones we give below) form an abstraction of the
notion of distance thus allowing for a uniﬁed treatment of numerous particular cases
under a single formalism. The ubiquity of metric spaces in Mathematics and Physics
is quite overwhelming but, naturally, this chapter is mainly concerned with examples
and results most relevant in the context of this book.
Section4.1 contains the deﬁnition of metric space and explores some examples,
primarily of normed spaces as metric spaces. Section4.2 is concerned with the topol-
ogy induced by the distance function, the associated concept of convergence, and
some basic topological observations regarding the induced topology. Section4.3
considers two types of structure preservation for mappings between metric spaces,
namely non-expanding mappings and uniformly continuous ones. Section4.4 is con-
cerned with the concept of completeness in metric spaces, the Banach Fixed-Point
Theorem and Baire’s Theorem, and Cantor’s metric completion process by means
of Cauchy sequences. Finally, Sect.4.5 examines compactness for metric spaces and
establishes the fact that a metric space is compact precisely when it is complete and
totally bounded.

Metric Spaces
4.1 Metric Spaces—Deﬁnition and Examples
Our intuitive understanding of the behaviour of distance, in the plane for instance, is
clearly represented in the deﬁnition of metric space that we give below. Of particular
importance is the simple fact that any normed space has a natural metric structure
associated with it (though most metric spaces certainly do not arise in this manner).
Consequently, the normed spaces encountered in Chap.2 are all revisited here so that
we may examine some of their metric properties.
Before we proceed with the deﬁnition and with a list of relevant examples we note
that for the general study of metric spaces there are technical advantages in allowing
inﬁnite distance between points. We thus ﬁrst adjoin the symbol ∞as an extended
real number and denote by R+ = {x ∈R | x ≥0} ∪{∞} the set of extended
non-negative real numbers.
Remark 4.1 We accept that x < ∞for all real x (and we also accept that ∞≤∞).
Addition is extended to include ∞by setting x +∞= ∞+ x = ∞for all extended
real x ≥0.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let X be a set. A function d : X × X →R+ is said to be a metric or
a distance function on X if, for all x, y, z ∈X, the following properties are satisﬁed.
1. Distance is symmetric, i.e., d(x, y) = d(y, x).
2. The triangle inequality is satisﬁed, i.e., d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, z).
3. Distance separates points, i.e., d(x, y) = 0 if, and only if, x = y.
The pair (X, d) is then called a metric space and d(x, y) the distance between x
and y. Quite often we refer to the metric space X without explicitly mentioning the
distance function d. Moreover, when two (or more) metric spaces are considered, we
often overload the symbol d to stand for the metric function in each space, relying on
semantics to resolve any confusion. If needed, we may refer to the metric function
of X by dX.
Remark 4.2 There is quite a lot of ﬂexibility in the choice of axioms above, giving
rise to several structures that may resemble metric spaces to varying degrees. For
instance, as noted above, it is possible that d(x, y) = ∞, that is we allow the distance
between points to be inﬁnity. Some authors do not permit the distance function to
attain the value ∞. In some sense, the difference between these two possibilities is
largely cosmetic. It is also possible to omit the separation condition, giving rise to
what are known as semimetric spaces, and again, their theory is quite similar to that
of metric spaces. If instead one neglects symmetry, giving rise to what are known as
quasimetric spaces, the resulting theory is in many respects strikingly different than
that of metric spaces.
Observing that all of the axioms of metric space are universally quantiﬁed, it follows
immediately that if S ⊆X is a subset of a metric space X, then the restriction of the
distance function d : X × X →R+ to the subset S × S is a distance function on S.

4.1 Metric Spaces—Deﬁnition and Examples
115
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Metric Subspace) For a subset S of a metric space X the pair (S, dS),
where dS is the restriction of d to S × S, is called a metric subspace (or simply
subspace if the metric context is clear) of X.
There are various ways for a function f between metric spaces to interact with the
metric structures, namely to preserve the distances to various degrees. The strictest
preservation of distance gives rise to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.3 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is said to be an
isometry if
d( f (x1), f (x2)) = d(x1, x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈X. If f is also bijective, then f is said to be an isometric isomorphism
or a global isometry. If there exists an isometric isomorphism between X and Y, then
we write X ∼= Y and we say that X and Y are isometric.
A property of metric spaces is said to be a metric invariant if whenever it holds for
a metric space X it also holds for any other metric space isometric to X.
The following theorem is a rich source of metric spaces.
Theorem 4.1 If V is a normed space, then deﬁning d : V × V →R+ by
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥
endows V with the structure of a metric space.
Proof Note ﬁrst that the codomain of d is indeed R+ since the norm is always non-
negative (in this case ∞is never attained as the distance between points). For all
vectors x, y, z ∈V , symmetry follows by
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥= ∥(−1) · (y −x)∥= | −1| · ∥y −x∥= ∥y −x∥= d(y, x),
while separation and the triangle inequality are just restatements of the conditions
of positivity and the triangle inequality in the deﬁnition of normed space (refer to
Deﬁnition2.15, and with the aid of Proposition 2.12).
□
Example 4.1 Each of the normed spaces (and in particular the inner product spaces)
introduced in Chap.2 gives rise to a metric space, and we obtain the following
examples of metric spaces.
The space Rn, n ≥1, with distance given by
d(x, y) =

known as the Euclidean metric on Rn. The space Cn, n ≥1, with distance given by

,
where we may immediately note that Cn is isometric to R2n with the Euclidean
metric, a global isometry f : Cn →R2n is given by
f (x1 + y1 · i, . . . , xn + yn · i) = (x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , xn, yn).
For all 1 ≤p < ∞, every pre-L p space, say of continuous real-valued functions on
the closed interval [a, b], is a metric space of functions with distance given by
d(x, y) =
 b
a
dt |x(t) −y(t)|p
1/p
.
In particular, C([a, b], R) supports inﬁnitely many different metric space structures,
one for each 1 ≤p < ∞. The case p = ∞, i.e., with the L∞norm, gives rise to yet
another distance function, namely
d(x, y) = max
a≤t≤b |x(t) −y(t)|.
Similarly, the space C(I, C) of continuous complex-valued functions on a closed
interval I = [a, b] supports an entire family of metric space structures. For each
1 ≤p < ∞the space ℓp of absolutely p-power summable sequences of either real
or complex numbers with distance given by
d(x, y) =
 ∞

k=1
|xk −yk|p
1/p
is yet another family of metric spaces. Of course the case p = ∞, i.e., the space ℓ∞
of bounded sequences with distance given by
d(x, y) = sup
k≥1
|xk −yk|
is a metric space as well. Beware here not to confuse the value ∞for the parameter
p with a limiting process.
Rn and Cn support other metric structures, different than those presented above, as
the following example shows.
Example 4.2 If we consider Rn as a subset of ℓp, with 1 ≤p ≤∞, by identifying
x = (x1, . . . , xn) with (x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, 0, . . .), then Rn inherits the metric of ℓp
and becomes a metric subspace of ℓp. In more detail, if p = ∞then

and otherwise

.
If n > 1 and p ̸= 2, then each of these metrics is different than the Euclidean metric.
A similar observation gives rise to a family of metric structures on Cn.
The following examples illustrate the subtleties that may arise with general metric
spaces.
Example 4.3 Consider R2 with the Euclidean metric, i.e., the plane with its ordinary
Euclidean metric structure. The unit circle S = {x ∈R2 | ∥x∥= 1} has two natural
metric structures on it. As a subspace of R2, the distance between two antipodal
points in S is 2 (the length of the shortest straight line connecting the two points
where the line is allowed to pass freely in the ambient space R2). On the other
hand, it is possible to endow the unit circle S with the so called intrinsic metric, the
one where the distance between two points is the length of the shorter of the two
arcs connecting them. With that metric the distance between antipodal points is π
(the length of a shortest geodesic connecting the two points, that is a “straight” line
connecting the points where the line is not allowed to step outside of S and into the
ambient space).
Other scenarios, perhaps more abstract, are also possible. For instance, given any
set X, deﬁning d(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈X and d(x, y) = 1 for all x, y ∈X with
x ̸= y turns X into a metric space. In this metric space the distances between any
two distinct points is 1. Thus, if X is inﬁnite, then X is not isometric to any subspace
of the Euclidean space Rn, for any n ≥1. Notice however that deﬁning d(x, y) = 0
for all x, y ∈X fails to be a metric space (unless X has at most one element) since
separation fails. It is however easily seen to be an example of a semimetric space.
Example 4.4 The set R+ can be given the metric structure
d(x, y) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
|x −y|
if x ̸= ∞̸= y
0
if x = y = ∞
∞
otherwise.
The metric axioms are easily veriﬁed. In fact, we will simply write d(x, y) = |x −y|
since the algebraic properties of this metric signiﬁcantly resemble those of |x −y|
for real x, y.
Finally, we present one of many ways to endow the cartesian product X × Y of two
metric spaces with a metric structure.
Deﬁnition 4.4 (TheAdditiveMetricProduct)Formetricspaces X andY thefunction
d : (X × Y) × (X × Y) →R+ given by

Metric Spaces
d((x, y), (x′, y′)) = dX(x, x′) + dY (y, y′)
is easily seen to be a distance function (as the reader may verify) and the metric space
(X × Y, d) is called the additive metric product of X and Y.
Exercises
Exercise 4.1 Let f : [0, ∞) →[0, ∞)beaconcave,strictlymonotonicallyincreas-

is a metric on Z. The metric space (Z, d) is then called the coproduct of X and Y.
Generalize this construction to give the coproduct of any number (ﬁnite or inﬁnite)
of metric spaces.
Exercise 4.3 Let X be a metric space. Deﬁne the relation ∼on X by x ∼y precisely
when d(x, y) < ∞. Prove that ∼is an equivalence relation. The equivalence class
[x], for any point x ∈X, is called the galaxy of x. Show that each galaxy, as a metric
subspace of X, has all distances ﬁnite and then show that X is the coproduct (see
previous exercise) of its galaxies.
Exercise 4.4 Suppose that (X, d) is a semimetric space and deﬁne the relation ∼
on X by x ∼y precisely when d(x, y) = 0. Prove that ∼is an equivalence relation
on X and that d([x], [y]) = d(x, y) on the quotient set X/∼is well-deﬁned and
endows it with the structure of a metric space.
Exercise 4.5 Given any two metric spaces (X, dX) and (Y, dY ), deﬁne the function

dX(x1, x2)2 + dY (y1, y2)2.
Prove that (X × Y, dE) is a metric space, called the Euclidean metric product of X
and Y. Generalize this construction to obtain the Euclidean metric product of any
ﬁnite number of metric spaces.
Exercise 4.6 Prove that every isometry is injective.

2. If X ∼= Y, then Y ∼= X
3. If X ∼= Y and Y ∼= Z, then X ∼= Z.
Exercise 4.8 Prove that the induced metric in a normed space V satisﬁes the equality
d(x + z, y + z) = d(x, y) for all vectors x, y, z ∈V . Namely, the induced metric in
a normed space V is translation invariant.
Exercise 4.9 Consider the set R of all Riemann integrable functions f : [a, b] →R
and deﬁne d : R × R →R+ by d( f, g) =

space?
Exercise 4.10 A mid-point for two distinct points x, z in a metric space X is a point
y ∈X such that d(x, y) = d(y, z) = d(x, z)/2. Give examples of:
• A metric space where every two distinct points admit a unique mid-point.
• A metric space where every two distinct points admit a mid-point, and some admit
two distinct mid-points.
• A metric space where no two distinct points admit a mid-point.
4.2 Topology and Convergence in a Metric Space
This section is concerned with the topological structure of a metric space. Every
metric space has a topology associated with it which is determined by the distance
function. A metric space is thus automatically a topological space and thus all of the
concepts of topological spaces, including convergence, are meaningful in a metric
space. After describing this so called induced topology we examine the concept of
convergence in the metric spaces introduced above. It should be noted immediately
that different metrics on the same set may induce the same topology. A topological
space induced by a metric is called a metrizable space and we study some of the
properties of such spaces.
As motivation for the induced topology we follow a similar route to the one we
took in Sect.3.1 where the concept of topology was motivated as a means to capture
continuity while avoiding arbitrary properties of the distance function.
Before we proceed we note that the familiar notion of continuity of a function
applies (formally verbatim) to arbitrary metric spaces.
Deﬁnition 4.5 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is continuous if for
all x ∈X and ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε
for all x′ ∈X.

Metric Spaces
4.2.1 The Induced Topology
The topology induced by a metric is given in terms of what are known as open balls,
which are shown below to form a basis for a topology. It should be made clear at
once that the resulting topology does not carry all of the metric information. In fact,
it carries very little of it. There may be many radically different distance functions
on a single set, all of which induce the same topology. Moreover, not every topology
is necessarily induced by a metric. Thus, replacing a metric by the induced topology
looses a lot of information and misses many topological spaces. However, it is often
convenient to be able to forget information, especially when it is not really needed
for the problem at hand.
Deﬁnition 4.6 Let X be a metric space, x ∈X, and ε > 0. The open ball with
centre x and radius ε is the set
Bε(x) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < ε}.
Example 4.5 Consider the Euclidean metric on Rn. The open ball Bε(x) in R is the
open interval (x −ε, x + ε), while in R2 it is the interior of the circle with centre x
and radius ε, and in R3 it is the interior of a ball with centre x and radius ε.
Obviously, in a general metric space an open ball need not look anything like a
ball. Figure4.1 shows the loci of points in R2 satisfying ∥x∥= 1 under the ℓp norm
for different values of p. Note that the case p = 1/2 is not at all a metric and is just
added here for the sake of completeness.
We now show that the open balls in a metric space X form a basis for a topology.
Theorem 4.2 The collection {Bε(x) | x ∈X, ε > 0} of all open balls in a metric
space X satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 3.10.
Proof Since x ∈Bε(x) for all x ∈X and ε > 0, it follows at once that the open balls
cover all of X. Next, suppose that z ∈Bε1(x)∩Bε2(y), and we will demonstrate that
z ∈Bε(z) ⊆Bε1(x) ∩Bε2(y) for ε = min{ε1 −d(x, z), ε2 −d(y, z)}. Indeed, if
d(w, z) < ε, then d(w, x) ≤d(w, z)+d(z, x) < (ε1 −d(x, z))+d(z, x) = ε1, and
so w ∈Bε1(x), and therefore Bε(z) ⊆Bε1(x). Similarly, Bε(z) ⊆Bε2(y). Noting
that ε > 0, the proof is complete.
□
The following deﬁnition is now justiﬁed.
Deﬁnition 4.7 Given a metric space (X, d), the induced topology on the set X is
the topology generated by the open balls in X. In particular, all open balls in X are
open sets, and a subset U ⊆X is open in the induced topology precisely when for
all x ∈U there exists an ε > 0 such that Bε(x) ⊆U. Any topological space (X, τ)
for which there exists a metric d on X inducing the given topology τ is called a
metrizable space.
Remark 4.3 Unless otherwise stated, every metric space is silently endowed with the
induced topology. Consequently, every metric space X is also a topological space.

Example 4.6 It is straightforward to see that the Euclidean distance d(x, y) = |x−y|
on R induces the Euclidean topology on R. One may also readily conﬁrm that the
discrete topology on a set X is induced by the distance function d : X × X →R+
given by d(x, y) = 1 if x ̸= y and d(x, x) = 0, thus any discrete topological space
is metrizable. Examples of non-metrizable spaces are easily constructed once a few
basic facts about metrizable spaces are observed, as done below.
Theorem 4.3 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is continuous in the
sense of Deﬁnition4.5 if, and only if, it is continuous with respect to the induced
topologies.
The proof is formally identical to the proof of Theorem 3.2 and is left for the reader.
We now turn to examine some general properties of metrizable spaces.
Theorem 4.4 Every metrizable space is Hausdorff.
Proof Let X be a topological space whose topology is induced by a metric d. Given
distinct points x, y ∈X let ε = d(x, y)/2, and notice that ε > 0. We claim that the
open balls Bε(x) and Bε(y) separate x and y. Indeed, if z ∈Bε(x) ∩Bε(y), then we
would have d(x, y) ≤d(x, z) + d(z, y) < 2ε = d(x, y), which is absurd.
□

Metric Spaces
By Theorem 3.12, convergent sequences in Hausdorff spaces have unique limits,
leading to the following familiar result stated for general metric spaces.
Corollary 4.1 In a metric space, a convergent sequence has a unique limit.
Apart from being Hausdorff, every metrizable topology, as we will see, has other
pleasant features inﬂuencing the behaviour of, e.g., sequences. It is worth-while to
notice that it is the interaction of a metric space with R+ (via the distance function),
which causes some of the familiar properties of the real numbers to reﬂect back to
any metric space. This is shown in the next result.
Theorem 4.5 Every metrizable space is ﬁrst countable.
Proof Let X be a topological space whose topology is induced by a metric d, and
let x ∈X. We need to exhibit a countable local basis at x. Indeed, consider the
collection {B1/n(x) | n ∈N}, which is clearly countable. To show that it is a local
basis, suppose that x ∈U for an open set U ⊆X. Then there is an ε > 0 with
Bε(x) ⊆U, and thus if we take any n > 1/ε, then B1/n(x) ⊆Bε(x) ⊆U, as
required.
□
Theorem 3.9 yields the following corollaries.
Corollary 4.2 A point x in a metric space X is a cluster point of a subset S ⊆X if,
and only if, x is the limit of a sequence of points from S.
Corollary 4.3 A subset F of a metrizable space X is closed if, and only if, F contains
all limit points of sequences in F.
Corollary 4.4 (Heine’s Continuity Criterion) A function f : X →Y between two
metrizable spaces is continuous if, and only if,
xm →x0 =⇒f (xm) →f (x0)
for all sequences {xm}m≥1 in X.
By Theorem 3.8, a second countable space is separable. We now show that for metric
spaces the converse holds as well.
Theorem 4.6 A separable metrizable space X is second countable.
Proof Let d be a metric inducing the topology on X. We are given the existence of a
countable and dense set D = {xk}k∈N in X and we need to exhibit a countable basis
for X. In the proof of Theorem 4.5 we saw that the collection
Bk = {B1/n(xk) | n ∈N}
is a local basis at xk. We now show that
B =

k∈N
Bk

4.2 Topology and Convergence in a Metric Space

is a basis for the topology of X, noticing that the result then follows since B, being
a countable union of countable sets, is itself countable (see Sect.1.2.13 of the Pre-
liminaries).
Let U ⊆X be an open subset, and choose x ∈U. There is then an ε > 0 such
that B2ε(x) ⊆U. Choose n ∈N such that 1/n < ε. Since D is dense and B1/n(x)
is open, it follows that D ∩B1/n(x) is not empty, and thus there is some m such that
xm ∈B1/n(x), in other words, d(x, xm) < 1/n. Now, the choice of n guarantees
that B1/n(xm) ⊆B2ε(x) ⊆U, while the choice of xm guarantees that x ∈B1/n(xm).
Noticing that B1/n(xm) ∈Bm, the above establishes that for every open set U and
x ∈U, there exists a B ∈B with x ∈B ⊆U, showing that B is a basis for the
topology on X.

4.2.2 Convergence in Metric Spaces
As remarked above, every metric space is in particular a topological space and thus
has an intrinsic notion of convergence which we now turn to investigate for the main
examples of metric spaces given above.
Proposition 4.1 A sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X converges to x0 ∈X if,
and only if, d(xm, x0) →0 in R in the usual sense of convergence.
Proof Suppose xm →x0 in the topological sense. Given ε > 0 consider the open
ball Bε(x0), which is open in the induced topology. That means that there exists an
N ∈N such that xm ∈Bε(x0) for all m > N. In other words, d(xm, x0) < ε for all
m > N, showing that d(xm, x0) →0. The converse is left for the reader.
□
Example 4.7 Consider Rn with the Euclidean metric

.
For a sequence {x(m)}m≥1 of elements in Rn and a point x ∈Rn, the inequalities
|x(m)
k
−xk| ≤d(x(m), x),
valid for all 1 ≤k ≤n, show that x(m) →x implies x(m)
k
→xk, for each component.
The converse is also true, (since there are only ﬁnitely many components), and thus
convergence in the Euclidean metric in Rn is equivalent to the usual convergence of
the components in R.
Example 4.8 Consider the space ℓp, p ≥1 (see Sect.2.5.4). Much as in the previous
example, convergence in the ℓp norm implies the convergence of each of the com-
ponents. However, as each vector now has inﬁnitely many components, the converse
does not necessarily hold. To see that, take the sequence {x(m)}m∈N where

if m = k,
0
if m ̸= k.
Each sequence {x(m)

}m∈N is eventually constantly 0, and thus the only candidate for
the limit of {x(m)}m∈N is the 0 vector. However,
d(x(m), 0) =



and thus x(m) ̸→0 in the metric sense, and therefore {x(m)}m≥1 does not converge
at all in ℓp. The same sequence exhibits similar behaviour in ℓ∞too.
Example 4.9 Consider the space C(I, R) of continuous real-valued functions on
the closed interval I = [a, b], with the metric induced by the L∞norm, i.e., for a
sequence of functions {xm}m≥1 and a function x0:
xm →x0
⇐⇒
max
t∈[a,b] |xm(t) −x0(t)| →0.
Thus, for any ﬁxed ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such that |xm(t) −x0(t)| < ε for
all m > N and for all t ∈[a, b]. In other words, xm converges to x0 uniformly on
[a, b]. Since the converse is also true, as is easily seen by traversing the arguments
backwards, we conclude that convergence in the L∞norm is nothing but uniform
convergence of functions on the interval [a, b].
Example 4.10 For 1 ≤p < ∞consider the pre-L p space C(I, R), with I = [a, b],
i.e., with distance given by
d(x, y) =
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠
1/p
.
Convergence with respect to this metric is called L p convergence. It is well-known,
from elementary considerations of the Riemann integral, that if xm →x0 uniformly,
then xm also converges to x0 in the L p norm. The converse is not generally true, as
we exemplify for the L2 norm. Consider the following sequence in C([0, 1], R):
xm(t) =
mt
if 0 ≤t ≤1
m ,
1
if 1
m < t ≤1.

shows that xm converges in L2 to the constant function x(t) = 1. However, point-
wise, xm(t) converges to the discontinuous function ˜x(t) = 1 for 0 < t ≤1 and
˜x(0) = 0. Since the uniform limit of continuous functions must be continuous, it
follows that {xm}m≥1 does not converge with respect to the L∞norm.
Example 4.11 In fact, L p convergence need not even imply point wise convergence
at any t in the domain. Indeed, consider C([0, 1], R) and, for simplicity, the L1 norm.
Let Im be the following sequence of intervals.The ﬁrst interval is I0 = [0, 1], the
entire segment. The next two intervals are I1 = [0, 1/2] and I2 = [1/2, 1]. The
next three intervals are obtained by subdividing [0, 1] into three equal segments,
the next four intervals are obtained by subdividing [0, 1] into four equal segments,
and so on. Consider for each m the indicator function xm = χIm. These functions
are not continuous, but let us ignore this for a while. It is clear that, with respect to
the L1 norm, xm converges to the constant function 0, since the integral
 1
0 dtχm is
the length of the segment that was considered in the m-th stage, and the segments’
sizes shrink to 0. However, for any 0 ≤t ≤1, the sequence {χm(t)}m≥1 contains
a subsequence which is constantly 1 and a subsequence which is constantly 0, and
thus does not converge. This example would thus serve our purpose, illustrating that
L1 convergence need not imply point wise convergence at any point, except that
the functions are not continuous. This can easily be remedied, with minor changes
in the details above, by sacriﬁcing a little bit of the segment used to deﬁne xm in
order to add two linear segments to the graph of χm so as to obtain the graph of a
continuous function xm. This can be done in such a way as to only slightly affect
the integrals so that the L1 convergence is unaltered, while retaining the point-wise
non-convergence.

4.3 Non-Expanding Functions and Uniform Continuity
Given two metric spaces X and Y, the rich structure embodied in the metrics can
be preserved to various degrees by functions f : X →Y. In a sense the weakest
preservation of structure one can impose is for f to be continuous while the strongest
is for f to be an isometry. In this section we look at two intermediate conditions for
structure preservation, namely non-expansion and uniform continuity.
Deﬁnition 4.8 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is non-expanding if
d( f (x), f (x′)) ≤d(x, x′)
for all x, x′ ∈X.
An important observation is that in any metric space (X, d) the distance function
d : X × X →R+ is non-expanding.

4.3 Non-Expanding Functions and Uniform Continuity
127
Lemma 4.1 Let X be a metric space and consider X × X with the additive metric
product structure (Deﬁnition4.4), and R+ with the metric structure described in
Example4.4. Then the distance function d : X × X →R+ is non-expanding.
Proof Given (x, x′), (y, y′) ∈X × X we may assume without loss of generality that
dX(x, x′) ≥dX(y, y′). Let us further assume that both dX(x, x′) and dX(y, y′) are
ﬁnite. It then follows that
dR+(d(x, x′), d(y, y′)) = |dX(x, x′) −dX(y, y′)| = dX(x, x′) −dX(y, y′).
Since
dX×X((x, x′), (y, y′)) = dX(x, y) + dX(x′, y′)
we need to show that
dX(x, x′) ≤dX(x, y) + dX(y, y′) + dX(y′, x′)
which is indeed the case by the triangle inequality. Treating the cases where either
dX(x, x′) = ∞or dX(y, y′) = ∞is similar.
□
Non-expansion is clearly a rather strong property, quite close in strength to being an
isometry. Uniform continuity, which we now introduce, is closer to the other end of
the spectrum of structure preservation and, in a sense, is only slightly stronger than
continuity.
Deﬁnition 4.9 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is uniformly contin-
uous if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε
for all x, x′ ∈X.
It is obvious that if f : X →Y is non-expanding, then it is uniformly continuous,
and that uniform continuity implies continuity. Neither of the converse implications
is generally true. However, the reader is familiar with the fact that continuity on a
closed interval implies uniform continuity. The crucial property here is that a closed
interval is compact. Indeed, we now show that if X is compact, then continuity does
imply uniform continuity. The proof we present relies on the topological concept
known as the Lebesgue number of a covering, requiring the following preparatory
concept which is part of the standard vocabulary in metric space theory.
Deﬁnition 4.10 Let X be a metric space and S ⊆X a subset. The diameter of S is
the extended real number
diam(S) = sup
x,y∈S
{d(x, y)}
(which may be ∞).

128
4
Metric Spaces
For instance, if S = {x, y}, then diam(S) = d(x, y). In Rn with the Euclidean metric
diam(Bε(x)) = 2ε, for all x ∈Rn and ε > 0. More generally, in an arbitrary metric
space diam(Bε(x)) ≤2ε always holds and equality may fail.
Lemma 4.2 (Lebesgue Number Lemma) Let X be a compact metric space. If
{Ui}i∈I is an arbitrary open covering of X, then there exists a δ > 0 such that
for all subsets S ⊆X with diam(S) < δ there is an i ∈I with S ⊆Ui.
Proof For each x ∈X there is an ix ∈I with x ∈Uix , and since Uix is open there
is an εx > 0 such that B2εx (x) ⊆Uix . Clearly, the collection {Bεx (x)}x∈X covers X,
and by compactness there is then a ﬁnite subcovering
X =
m

k=1
Bεxk (xk).
We now show that
δ = min{εx1, . . . , εkm},
which is clearly positive, satisﬁes the requirement of the lemma. Suppose then that
S ⊆X is a subset with diam(S) < δ, and we may assume S ̸= ∅, so let us ﬁx an
element y ∈S. Since y ∈X and X is covered by {Bεk(x)}1≤k≤n we may ﬁnd an
x = xk0, with corresponding ε = εk0, such that y ∈Bε(x). It now follows, for any
y′ ∈S, that d(y, y′) ≤diam(S) < δ, and thus y′ ∈Bδ(y). However,
Bδ(y) ⊆Bε(y) ⊆B2ε(x) ⊆Ux
(as the reader is invited to verify) and thus y′ ∈Ux. As y′ ∈S was arbitrary it follows
that S ⊆Ux, as required.
□
A δ as in the statement above is called a Lebesgue number for the given covering.
Theorem 4.7 (Heine-Cantor) A continuous function f : X →Y from a compact
metric space X to an arbitrary metric space Y is uniformly continuous.
Proof Given ε > 0 consider, for each y ∈Y, the set
Uy = f −1(B ε
2 (y))
which is open since f is continuous. Clearly, x ∈U f (x) for all x ∈X, and thus
{Uy}y∈X is an open covering of X. We may now choose a Lebesgue number δ > 0
for that covering. Suppose that
d(x, x′) < δ
for points x, x′ ∈X. Then, diam({x, x′}) < δ and thus {x, x′} ⊆f −1(Bε/2(y))
for some y ∈Y. That means that d( f (x), y) < ε/2 and that d( f (x′), y) < ε/2.

4.3 Non-Expanding Functions and Uniform Continuity
129
Applying the triangle inequality yields
d( f (x), f (x′)) ≤d( f (x), y) + d(y, f (x′)) < ε
as needed.
□
Since uniform continuity always entails continuity, the result above implies that for
a function f : X →Y between metric spaces with a compact domain the concepts
of continuity and of uniform continuity coincide.

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
This section is devoted to completeness in a metric space. A metric space X is said
to be complete when every Cauchy sequence in it converges. Thus, in a sense, X is
complete when every sequence in X that should converge actually does converge.
The section starts with a discussion of the concept of Cauchy sequences in general
metric spaces and then considers the completeness of R. The reader may already
be familiar with the completeness of the real numbers, a property that is commonly
stated in the form of the least upper bound principle: every non-empty bounded
above set of real numbers has a supremum (for more details see Sect.1.2.19 of
the Preliminaries). We show below that the least upper bound property implies the
metric completeness of R, namely that any Cauchy sequence in R converges (when
R is given the Euclidean metric). We then examine the metric spaces introduced
above, together with an investigation of their completeness. Next we establish two
fundamental theorems of complete metric spaces, namely the Banach Fixed-Point
Theorem and Baire’s Theorem. The importance of these results is difﬁcult to over
emphasize, particularly in the context of this book. As will be shown in Chap.5,
the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem can be used to iteratively solve certain differential
equations. Some of the consequences of Baire’s Theorem in the theory of Banach
spaces will also be given. This chapter then closes with a description of a completion
process, i.e., a way to turn any metric space, complete or not, into a complete one
while altering it as little as possible. The construction we present is that of Cantor’s
using Cauchy sequences.
4.4.1 Complete Metric Spaces
Given a sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X, the statement
∃x0 ∈X ∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀m ≥N : d(xm, x0) < ε
is nothing but the claim that xm →x0. By interchanging the ﬁrst two quantiﬁers in
the statement above we arrive at the statement
∀ε > 0 ∃xε ∈X, N ∈N ∀m ≥N : d(xm, xε) < ε
which we call the global Cauchy condition. It expresses something considerably
weaker than the existence of a limit. Namely, to establish convergence one needs
to manufacture an appropriate N ∈N for any given ε > 0 without altering the
limiting point. With the global Cauchy condition on the other hand one is ﬁrst given
an ε > 0, and may then manufacture the limit point xε, and a corresponding N ∈N.
Thus the global Cauchy condition expresses the existence of a sort of varying limit of

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
131
the sequence. In particular, if the sequence converges to x0, then the global Cauchy
condition is satisﬁed simply by taking xε = x0.
A simple analysis of the situation reveals that the xε can be entirely removed from
the global Cauchy condition, as follows. Suppose that the global Cauchy condition
is satisﬁed and let ε > 0 be given. There exist then an xε ∈X and an N ∈N so that
d(xm, xε) < ε/2, for all m ≥N. It then follows that
d(xk, xm) ≤d(xk, xε) + d(xε, xm) ≤ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
for all k, m ≥N. Conversely, suppose that for all ε > 0 there exists an N ∈N such
that
d(xk, xm) < ε
for all k, m ≥N. Then, taking xε = xN, it follows that
d(xm, xε) = d(xm, xN) < ε
for all m ≥N, and so the global Cauchy condition is satisﬁed. This discussion is
summarized as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.11 A sequence {xm}m≥1 in a metric space X is a Cauchy sequence if
it satisﬁes the Cauchy condition:
∀ε > 0 ∃N ∈N ∀k, m ≥N : d(xk, xm) < ε.
Equivalently, a sequence {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence if it satisﬁes the global
Cauchy condition
∀ε > 0 ∃xε ∈X, N ∈N ∀m ≥N : d(xm, xε) < ε.
The familiar fact that every convergent sequence in R (when endowed with the
Euclidean metric) is a Cauchy sequence is now nothing but the remark, made above,
that the global Cauchy condition is trivially implied by the existence of a limit. The
converse in R is well-known to be true (and we prove that fact below) but for general
metric spaces the converse may fail. To see that, start with any convergent sequence
xm →x0 in a metric space X satisfying xm ̸= x0, for all m ≥1, and consider
the same sequence {xm}m≥1 in the subspace X −{x0}. Clearly, {xm}m≥1 satisﬁes
the Cauchy condition (indeed, it is a convergent sequence in X). However, it only
converges in X since if it converged in X −{x0} too, say to the point y ∈X −{x0},
then it would also converge to y in X, contradicting uniqueness of limits in a metric
space.
Deﬁnition 4.12 A metric space X in which every Cauchy sequence admits a limit
in X is said to be a complete metric space.

132
4
Metric Spaces
As promised above we now closely examine the completeness of the reals, which,
as we will see, is a pivotal result.
Example 4.12 (The completeness of R) The space R with the Euclidean metric
d(x, y) = |x −y| is a most fundamental example of a complete metric space. Recall
(e.g., Sect.1.2.19 of the Preliminaries) that the real numbers R are deﬁned to be any
Dedekind complete ordered ﬁeld.
Given a Cauchy sequence {xm}m≥1 of real numbers, we ﬁrst note that {xm}m≥1 is
bounded by some number M, i.e., |xm| < M for all m ∈N. Indeed, for ε = 1 there
exists an N ∈N such that |xk −xm| < 1 for all k, m ≥N, and thus we found a
bounded tail of the sequence, and thus the entire sequence is bounded. Let S ⊆R be
the subset consisting of all x ∈R such that the inequality x < xm holds for almost all
m ∈N (meaning that it holds for all m ∈N with at most ﬁnitely many exceptions).
Clearly, for our chosen upper bound M we have that −M ∈S and M /∈S, and thus
S is non-empty and bounded above. By the least upper bound principle in R the set
S admits a supremum L. We will proceed to show that L is in fact the limit of the
given sequence. Given ε > 0 let N ∈N with |xk −xm| < ε/2 for all k, m ≥N. In
particular, taking m = N, we see that
xm −ε
2 < xk < xm + ε
2
holds for all k ≥N. These inequalities imply, by deﬁnition of S, that
xm −ε
2 ∈S,
while
xm + ε
2 /∈S.
Since L is the least upper bound of S it now follows that
xm −ε
2 ≤L ≤xm + ε
2.
Combining all of the inequalities above, it follows that
|xk −L| ≤|xk −xm| + |xm −L| ≤ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
for all k > N, proving that xm →L. R is thus metrically complete.
Remark 4.4 The amount of work put into this example is quite adequately justiﬁed
by noticing that the completeness of R is used in establishing the completeness of
all of the forthcoming examples of complete metric spaces.
Remark 4.5 It should be noted that Dedekind completeness is a stronger property
than metric completeness, in the following sense. While every Dedekind complete
ordered ﬁeld is metrically complete, there exist metrically complete ordered ﬁelds
which are not Dedekind complete. None of these examples would be Archimedean
though. These issues however are not particularly relevant to us here.

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
133
Example 4.13 In contrast to the situation with the real numbers, the metric space Q
of rational numbers with d(x, y) = |x −y| is not complete. Indeed, by the density of
Q in R, for every irrational α there is a sequence of rational numbers with xm →α
in R. Such a sequence is thus Cauchy in both R and Q but fails to converge in Q.
Before examining the completeness property for the metric spaces introduced above,
we remark that completeness is a metric invariant. In fact, we establish a slightly
stronger result.
Proposition 4.2 (Uniformly Continuous Functions Preserve Cauchy Sequences) If
f : X →Y is a uniformly continuous function between metric spaces and {xm}m≥1
is a Cauchy sequence in X, then { f (xm)}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in Y.
Proof Given ε > 0 let δ > 0 be such that
d(x, x′) < δ =⇒d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε.
Since {xm}m≥1 is Cauchy, there exists an N ∈N such that
k, m ≥N =⇒d(xk, xm) < δ.
Combining the two implications yields
k, m ≥N =⇒d( f (xk), f (xm)) < ε,
as needed for showing that { f (xm)}m≥1 is Cauchy.
□
Corollary 4.5 Let f : X →Y be an invertible continuous function between metric
spaces such that f −1 : Y →X is uniformly continuous. If X is complete, then so
is Y.
Proof Let {ym}m≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in Y. Then { f −1(ym)}m≥1 is a Cauchy
sequence in X and since X is complete the sequence converges: f −1(ym) →x0.
Since a continuous function preserves limits of sequences, we may now apply f to
conclude that ym →f (x0).
□
Corollary 4.6 Completeness is a metric invariant.

metric
d(x, y) =

we already saw that x(m) →x if, and only if, x(m)
k
→xk for each 1 ≤k ≤n. To show
that Rn is complete, suppose that {x(m)}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence. Then, for each

1 ≤k ≤n, the sequence {x(m)
k
}m≥1 is also Cauchy (since |x(m)
k

k

and since R is complete, we conclude that x(m)
k
→xk for all 1 ≤k ≤n, and
therefore that x(m) →(x1, . . . , xn). Thus, every Cauchy sequence in Rn converges,
as claimed.
Example 4.15 (Completeness of Cn) The metric space Cn with distance given by
d(x, y) =


k=1
|xk −yk|2
1/2
is complete. It was already remarked that Cn is isometric to R2n, and thus, since
completeness is a metric invariant, the completeness of R2n implies that of Cn.
Example 4.16 For a closed interval I = [a, b] the space C(I, R) of continuous
functions on I, with the metric structure induced by the L∞norm, is complete. To
see that, recall that convergence with respect to this metric is uniform convergence of
sequences of functions. If {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence of continuous real-valued
functions on I, then one easily sees that for each t ∈[a, b] the sequence {xm(t)}m≥1
is a Cauchy sequence in R with respect to the Euclidean metric. As R is complete it
follows that xm(t) →x(t), showing that {xm}m≥1 converges point-wise to a function
x : [a, b] →R, and in fact the convergence is easily seen to be uniform. To conclude
we recall the well-known fact that if a sequence of continuous functions converges
uniformly to a function x, then x is continuous. Thus, x ∈C(I, R) and is the uniform
limit of the given sequence.
Example 4.17 In contrast to the L∞case, for all 1 ≤p < ∞the pre-L p space

then x can not be continuous.
Example 4.18 Going back to C(I, R), I = [a, b] and a < b, with the metric
obtained from the L∞norm (for which convergence is equivalent to uniform con-
vergence), which was shown to be complete, consider the subspace P ⊆C(I, R)
consisting only of the polynomial functions. As a subspace of the complete space
C(I, R) the space P is not complete. To see that, recall that the polynomials

converge uniformly to the exponential function et, which is not a polynomial. Thus
the sequence {pm}m≥1 is Cauchy (since it converges in C(I, R)) but it does not
converge to a polynomial and thus does not converge in P at all (since if it would,
then it would have two different limits in C(I, R)).
Example 4.19 The space ℓp (of all absolutely p-power summable sequences of, say,
real numbers) is complete. To see that, let {x(m)}m≥1 be a Cauchy sequence in ℓp.
Since |x(m)

converges point-wise to x = (x1, . . . , xk, . . .). The completeness of ℓp will follow
by showing that the convergence is also in the ℓp norm. Firstly, to verify that x ∈ℓp,
note that since {x(m)}m≥1 is Cauchy, it is bounded, say by M. Now, for all K ≥1

4.4.2 Banach’s Fixed-Point Theorem
A ﬁxed-point for a function f : X →X is a point x0 ∈X such that f (x0) = x0. The
importance of ﬁxed-points lies in the ability to phrase the solutions of many important
problems as ﬁxed-points for suitable functions (this technique will be demonstrated
in Chap.5).
The following metric condition will be shown to guarantee the existence of a
unique ﬁxed-point for a function f as above, provided X is a non-empty complete
metric space.
Deﬁnition 4.13 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is called a contrac-
tion if there exists a real number α with 0 ≤α < 1 such that
d( f (x1), f (x2)) ≤αd(x1, x2)
for all x1, x2 ∈X.
We note at once that a function need not be a contraction in order to posses ﬁxed-
points. An extreme example is the identity function id : X →X on any metric space.
It is not a contraction yet every point is a ﬁxed-point for it.
Theorem 4.8 (Banach Fixed-Point Theorem) If X is a complete non-empty metric
space and f : X →X is a contraction, then f has a unique ﬁxed-point x0 ∈X.
Proof To prove the existence of a ﬁxed-point, let x1 be an arbitrary element in X
and consider the sequence x2 = f (x1), x3 = f (x2), and in general xm+1 = f (xm).
If this sequence converges to some limit x0 ∈X, then, since continuous functions
preserve limits of sequences, we will have that
f (x0) = f ( lim
m→∞xm) = lim
m→∞f (xm) = lim
m→∞xm+1 = lim
m→∞xm = x0
and so x0 is a ﬁxed-point of f . To show that the sequence does indeed converge,
we employ the completeness of X and proceed to show that the sequence is Cauchy.
Since the function f is a contraction, we know that there exists an 0 ≤α < 1
such that

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
137
d( f (x), f (y)) ≤αd(x, y)
for all x, y ∈X. We need to estimate the quantities d(xk, xm) for the sequence
deﬁned above, and we notice ﬁrst that for all x, y ∈X, the triangle inequality yields
d(x, y) ≤d(x, f (x)) + d( f (x), f (y)) + d( f (y), y)
≤d(x, f (x)) + αd(x, y) + d( f (y), y)
and thus
d(x, y) ≤d(x, f (x)) + d(y, f (y))
1 −α
which immediately shows that if x and y are both ﬁxed-points of f , then d(x, y) = 0,
and thus x = y, so the uniqueness clause is proven.
A straightforward application of the latter inequality shows that
d(xk, xm) ≤αk + αm
1 −α d(x1, f (x1))
immediately establishing that {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence.

4.4.3 Baire’s Theorem
The result we present below has numerous important implications in analysis in
general and in functional analysis and Banach space theory in particular. Baire’s
theorem can be interpreted as stating that a non-empty complete metric space can
not be small when size is topologically measured as follows. The set Q of rational
numbers is countable while R is uncountable and thus, in the sense of cardinality
of sets, Q is negligible compared to R. However, from a topological point-of-view,
since the closure of Q is all of R, the set Q is quite large. The opposite situation is
that of a nowhere dense set, namely a set S whose closure has empty interior, and
is thus a (topologically speaking) very small set. Sets which are countable unions of
nowhere dense sets are called meager sets. The claim of Baire’s Theorem is that a
non-empty complete metric space is never meager.
Remark 4.6 Many of the deﬁnitions below can be stated in the greater generality of
topological spaces. However, we keep the discussion rooted in metric spaces since
the added generality is not of importance here.
Deﬁnition 4.14 A subset S ⊆X in a metric space X is said to be nowhere dense if
the interior of its closure is empty. Equivalently, S is nowhere dense when S contains
no non-empty open subsets.

138
4
Metric Spaces
Nowhere dense sets are, in a sense, very small. For instance, if x is not an isolated
point, i.e., {x} is not open, then {x} is nowhere dense. It is obvious that a subset of
a nowhere dense subset is itself nowhere dense, and that a ﬁnite union of nowhere
dense subsets is itself nowhere dense. However, a countable union of nowhere dense
subsets need not be nowhere dense. For instance, in R with the Euclidean metric no
point is isolated and thus every singleton {x} is nowhere dense, and consequently
every ﬁnite subset of R is nowhere dense. However, Q (which is a countable union
of singleton sets, and thus of nowhere dense sets) is not nowhere dense. In fact, it is
everywhere dense, i.e., its closure is the entire space R.
Deﬁnition 4.15 A subset S ⊆X in a metric space X is said to be meager if it is a
countable union of nowhere dense subsets.
Clearly, every nowhere dense subset is meager, but not vice-versa (e.g., Q is meager
in R but not nowhere dense). It is again left for the reader to establish that a subset of
a meager set is itself meager, and that a countable union of meager subsets is meager.
Since X is a subset of itself we may speak of X itself being meager. We may now
state the main theorem.
Theorem 4.9 (Baire) A complete non-empty metric space is not meager.
Proof Suppose that X is a complete, non-empty, and meager metric space. Then
X =
∞

m=1
Sm
where each Sm ⊆X is nowhere dense. By noting that the closure of a nowhere dense
subset is itself nowhere dense, we may further assume (by taking closures) that each
Sm is closed. Since X is non-empty X is not nowhere dense, and thus, for all m ≥1,
one has that Sm ̸= X.
It follows that X −S1 is a non-empty open subset of X, and so there exists a point
x1 ∈X and ε1 > 0 with
Bε1(x1) ⊆X −S1.
Since S2 does not contain any open subset, it certainly does not contain Bε1(x). Thus
the set Bε1(x1) ∩(X −S2), which is open, is not empty. Therefore, there exists a
point x2 ∈X and ε2 > 0 with
Bε2(x2) ⊆Bε1(x1) ∩(X −S2).
Continuing in this manner we obtain, for each m ≥1, a point xm ∈X and εm > 0
such that
Bεm+1(xm+1) ⊆Bεm(xm) ∩(X −Sm).

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
139
Notice that we may assume that εm < 1/m holds for all m ≥1, which readily implies
that {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence, which thus converges to a limit point x0 ∈X.
Our next claim is that the limit point x0 belongs to Bεm(xm) for each m ≥1. Indeed,
by the assumption that εm ≤1/m, it follows, for all k ≥m, that Bεk(xk) is contained
in the closure of Bεm+1(xm+1), which in turn is contained in Bεm(xm). Thus, a tail of
the sequence is contained in the closure of Bεm+1(xm+1), which is closed, and thus
the limit is contained in it too, and thus the limit is in Bεm(xm). Now, since {Sm}m≥1
covers X, we must have x0 ∈Sm0 for some m0 ≥1. But then, x0 /∈X −Sm0 and
thus x0 /∈Bε0+1(xm+1), a contradiction.
□
Corollary 4.7 A complete non-empty metric space X with no isolated points must
be uncountable.
Proof If X were countable, then since
X =

x∈X
{x}
and each {x} is nowhere dense it would follow that X is meager.
□
Corollary 4.8 The set R of real numbers is uncountable.
Proof When endowed with the Euclidean metric, the space R is complete and has
no isolated points.
□
4.4.4 Completion of a Metric Space
If X is a metric space which is not complete, then it is because there exist Cauchy
sequences in it that fail to converge in X. Quite often though the space X is seen to
be embedded inside a larger metric space which is complete. This is the situation
for instance for Q as a metric subspace of R with the Euclidean metric. There are
however other situation where it is not a-priori clear that the metric space in question
embeds in a complete one. For instance, the space C(I, R) with the metric obtained
from the L2 norm is not complete (as we have seen) and it is not evident that it is
embedded in a larger, complete, space.
It is thus natural to ask if any metric space can be completed. That is, whether
every metric space embeds in a potentially (much) larger complete metric space. Of
course, one would have to set some expectations from such a completion, primarily
that it is not too wasteful. In more detail, we are willing to accept that the completion
may need to be larger than the original space, but we do not want it to be any larger
than it must be. The following deﬁnition turns this rather vague formulation into a
precise condition.
Deﬁnition 4.16 Let X be a metric space. A complete metric space Y together with
an isometry ι : X →Y is said to be a metric completion (or simply a completion) of

140
4
Metric Spaces
X if ι(X) is dense in Y. It is common to speak of Y as a completion of X, leaving
ι : X →Y implicit, and it is also common to write ˆX for a completion.
Example 4.20 Clearly, the inclusion ι : Q →R expresses R as a completion of Q,
when both sets are endowed with the metric d(x, y) = |x −y|.
The following theorem states that uniformly continuous functions with complete
codomains can be extended uniquely to a completion of the domain. This is a very
important property of metric completions.
Theorem 4.10 Let f : X →Y be a uniformly continuous function between metric
spaces, with Y complete. If ι : X →ˆX is a completion, then there exists a unique
uniformly continuous function F : ˆX →Y which extends f , i.e., such that f = F ◦ι.
Proof We present here only the outline of the proof, inviting the reader to provide
further details.
1. To construct an extension F : ˆX →Y let x0 ∈ˆX be arbitrary and consider any
sequence {xm}m≥1 in X with ι(xm) →x0. This can be done since ι(X) is dense
in ˆX.
2. Since {ι(xm)}m≥1 converges, it is a Cauchy sequence, and since ι is an isometry,
{xm}m≥1 is Cauchy as well.
3. Since a uniformly continuous function preserves Cauchy sequences, it follows
that the sequence { f (xm)}m≥1 is Cauchy in Y.
4. Since Y is complete, every Cauchy sequence converges, and thus f (xm) →y0,
for some y0 ∈Y, and we denote F(x0) = y0.
5. At this point one needs to verify that F(x0) is independent of the chosen sequence
{xm}m≥1. This can be done by showing that for any other sequence {x′
m}m≥1 in
X with ι(x′
m) →x0,
d( lim
k→∞f (xm), lim
k→∞f (x′
m)) = 0
(by appealing to the continuity of the distance function).
6. The veriﬁcation that F extends f , namely that F(ι(x)) = f (x) for all x ∈X, is
immediate by considering the constant sequence {xm}m≥1, xm = x.
7. One then needs to verify that F is uniformly continuous. Consequently, F is
continuous.
8. Finally, the uniqueness of F follows since any two continuous functions that agree
on a dense subset, agree everywhere.
□
Remark 4.7 The ability to extend a uniformly continuous function to a completion
of the domain does not hold for arbitrary continuous functions. For instance, take
the set S = {1/n | n ∈N} as a metric subspace of R under the Euclidean metric.
Topologically, it is a discrete space and thus any function f : S →Y, to any metric
space Y, is continuous. Such a function merely corresponds to a sequence in Y. Now,
let ˆS = S ∪{0} and notice that with the inclusion function ι : S →ˆS, we obtain a
completion of S. The space ˆS is not discrete and indeed one can easily verify that

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
141
a continuous function F : ˆS →Y corresponds to a sequence in Y together with its
limit point. In other words, while continuous functions f : S →Y correspond to
arbitrary sequences in Y, continuous functions F : ˆS →Y correspond to convergent
sequences in Y. Clearly, there are plenty of example of complete metric spaces
Y where not every sequence converges, and thus not every continuous function
f : S →Y extends to a continuous function F : ˆS →Y.
We now pose and answer two natural questions about completions of a metric space
X, namely does a completion always exist and whether it is unique. We ﬁrst address
the question of uniqueness. Suppose that ι : X →Y is a completion. Given any
bijection g : Y →Y ′, with Y ′ an arbitrary set, the metric structure of Y can be
transferred to a metric structure on Y ′ by deﬁning d : Y ′ ×Y ′ →R+ by d(y′
1, y′
2) =
d(g−1(y′
1), g−1(y′
2)), and then g is a global isometry. Informally, there is no essential
difference between Y and Y ′, and thus it is expected that Y ′ can also serve as a
completion for X. This is indeed the case, as the reader can check that the composition
g ◦ι : X →Y ′ is a completion. It thus follows that a completion is never unique
(except when it is empty), but, more importantly, we are guided to ask a more reﬁned
question: Given two completions ι : X →Y and ι′ : X →Y ′ for the same metric
space X, are Y and Y ′ isometric? The afﬁrmative answer is embodied in the following
result.
Theorem 4.11 Let X be a metric space. If ι : X →Y and ι′ : X →Y ′ are
completions of X, then there exists a global isometry ρ : Y →Y ′.
Proof Since ι′ : X →Y ′ is an isometry, it is in particular uniformly continuous, and
thus ι′ extends uniquely to a uniformly continuous function ρ : Y →Y ′, satisfying
that ρ ◦ι = ι′. Reversing the roles of ι and ι′, the same argument yields a uniformly
continuous function ρ′ : Y ′ →Y with ρ′◦ι′ = ι. Let us now consider ρ′◦ρ : Y →Y,
for which we have that ρ′ ◦ρ ◦ι = ρ′ ◦ι′ = ι. Thus, ρ′ ◦ρ : Y →Y is a uniformly
continuous function which extends ι. However, quite trivially, the identity function
idY : Y →Y satisﬁes idY ◦ι = ι, namely it too is a uniformly continuous function
extending ι. But, such an extension was proven above to be unique, and thus we
must conclude that ρ′ ◦ρ = idY . A similar argument reveals that ρ ◦ρ′ = idY ′,
and thus that ρ is bijective and ρ′ is its inverse. Finally, due to the continuity of the
distance function, for all y1, y2 ∈Y, choosing sequences {am}m≥1 and {bm}m≥1 with
ι(am) →y1 and ι(bm) →y2,
dY (y1, y2) = lim
m→∞dY (ι(am), ι(bm)) = lim
m→∞dX(am, bm)
while
dY ′(ρ(y1), ρ(y2)) = lim
m→∞dY ′((ρ ◦ι)(am), (ρ ◦ι)(bm))
= lim
m→∞dY ′(ι′(am), ι′(bm)) = lim
m→∞dX(am, bm).

142

Metric Spaces
In short then, dY (y1, y2) = dY ′(ρ(y1), ρ(y2)), namely ρ is an isometry, and, as seen
above, a global one.
□
The result above shows that all completions of a metric space X are isometric and
thus that the completion is unique up to an isomorphism. In light of the preceding
discussion, we can not hope for anything more than that.
We now turn to the existence of a completion of an arbitrary metric space X.
Since a completion is only unique up to an isometry, and thus if one (non-empty)
completion of X exists, then inﬁnitely many different completions of X exist, it
should not be surprising that there are in the literature different constructions of
embeddings ι : X →ˆX, yielding different (yet isometric) completions. The one we
present is due to Cantor. The reader may wish to refer to the construction of the reals,
outlined in Sect.1.1, since it is closely related to the general completion construction
below, only framed in a more familiar and less abstract setting.
Let us ﬁx a metric space X and construct a completion for it in a series of steps,
leaving it to the reader to provide the proofs. If X is not complete, then there exists
a Cauchy sequence {xm}m≥1 which fails to have a limit in X. Intuitively, completing
X entails adjoining to X formal limits for all such Cauchy sequences. If we denote
the formal limit of {xm}m≥1 by [{xm}], then we are led to deﬁne ˆX as the union
X ∪{[{xm}] | {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X which fails to converge}.
However, two different Cauchy sequences {xm}m≥1 and {ym}m≥1 may converge to
the same point (for instance, there are many different sequences of rationals that
converge to, e.g.,
√
2), and thus an equivalence relation needs to be introduced.
There is also a simplifying observation, namely that we may identify an element
x ∈X with the constant sequence {xm = x}m≥1 (which is clearly Cauchy). Thus,
instead of the union of X with the formal limits of limit-less Cauchy sequences, we
expect a completion of X to have the underlying set
ˆX = {[{xm}] | {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X}
where now [{xm}] denotes an equivalence class for a suitable equivalence relation
on the set of all Cauchy sequences in X. The following steps realize this idea.
1. Let ˜X be the set of all Cauchy sequences in X and deﬁne ˜d : ˜X × ˜X →R by
˜d({xm}, {ym}) = lim
m→∞d(xm, ym).
2. Prove that the limit deﬁning ˜d((xm), (ym)) always exists. (Hint: The metric
function d : X × X →R+ is uniformly continuous, and R is complete.)
3. Prove that ( ˜X, ˜d) is a semimetric space.
4. Recall Exercise 4.4 and let ˆX be the metric space thus obtained from ˜X.

4.4 Complete Metric Spaces
143
5. Prove that ( ˆX, d) is complete. (Hint: Avoid the temptation of taking the diagonal
of a Cauchy sequence of Cauchy sequences. Instead, use the Cauchy condition
whenever you can.)
6. Note that for all x ∈X, the constant sequence {xm = x}m≥1 is Cauchy, thereby
deﬁning a function ι : X →ˆX. Prove that it is an isometry.
7. Prove that ι(X) is dense in ˆX.
Remark 4.8 Any metric space X has a completion, and thus, if non-empty, X has
inﬁnitely many different (yet isomeric) completions. It is important to realize that
there is no distinguished completion that deserves to be called the completion of X.
Any particular construction of a completion for X can thus be seen as a model of the
completion of X, whatever it may mean. Since isometric metric spaces are essentially
the same it does not matter which model is used for the completion. However, some
models may lend themselves to establish certain properties more easily than other
models would.

4.5 Compactness and Boundedness
Compactness is a topological property and since, as we saw, any metric space is
naturally endowed with a topology, compactness is meaningful in any metric space.
The notion of completeness on the other hand is a metric property and does not
have a topological counter-part. Completeness and compactness are not independent
properties. The space R (with the Euclidean metric) is complete but not compact,
its subset [0, 1] is both complete and compact, and (0, 1) is neither complete nor
compact. The ﬁnal possibility though, as we show below, is implied; if a metric
space is compact, then it must be complete. In this section we show the remarkable
fact that compactness in a metric space is equivalent to completeness together with a
property known as total boundedness. The latter is a purely metric property and thus
the result shows that the topological property of compactness is equivalent (for metric
spaces, of course) to the conjunction of the purely metric conditions of completeness
and total boundedness.
The reader is familiar with the notion of bounded sets in the Euclidean space Rn.
In a general metric space though there are two notions of boundedness, given next.
These two notions coincide in the Euclidean spaces. Recall that for a subset S ⊆X
of a metric space X, its diameter is given by diam(S) = supx,y∈S{d(x, y)}, which
may be ∞.
Deﬁnition 4.17 A subset S in a metric space X is said to be bounded if its diameter
is ﬁnite. A subset S is totally bounded if for every ε > 0 one can cover S by ﬁnitely
many sets of diameter smaller than ε.
The reader is invited to show that every totally bounded set is bounded, but that the
converse need not hold. It is also evident that if S′ ⊆S ⊆X and S is bounded
(respectively totally bounded), then S′ is bounded (respectively totally bounded).
Since X is a subset of itself, we may speak of the metric space X as being bounded
or totally bounded.
The following result, whose proof is left for the reader, has an important corollary
which is pivotal for the proof of the main theorem below.
Proposition 4.3 The equality diam(S) = diam(S) holds for all subsets S of a metric
space X.

4.5 Compactness and Boundedness
145
Corollary 4.9 Let X be a totally bounded metric space, U = {Ui}i∈I an open
covering of X, and ε > 0. If X can not be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from
U , then there exists a non-empty closed set F ⊆X with diam(F) < ε that also can
not be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U .
Proof Since X is totally bounded it can be covered by ﬁnitely many subsets of
diameter smaller than ε. By the preceding proposition, we may take the closures
of these sets without altering their diameters and thus we may assume they are all
closed. If each of these sets was covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U , then
(by taking the union) X itself would be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U ,
contrary to the assumption on X. Thus at least one of these closed sets is the desired
one.
□
Theorem 4.12 For a metric space X the following conditions are equivalent.
1. X is compact.
2. X is sequentially compact, i.e., every sequence {xm}m≥1 admits a convergent
subsequence {xmk}k≥1.
3. X is complete and totally bounded.
Proof We prove ﬁrst that if X is compact, then X is sequentially compact, and so
let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence in X. If the set S = {xm | m ∈N} is ﬁnite, then some of
its elements must repeat inﬁnitely often in the given sequence. In other words, the
sequence contains a constant subsequence, which certainly converges. Otherwise S
is an inﬁnite subset in a compact topological space and thus, by Theorem 3.17, it
admits a cluster point x0 ∈X and by Corollary 4.2 this cluster point is the limit of a
sequence of elements from S.
Next we show that if X is sequentially compact, then it is complete and totally
bounded. Suppose thus that {xm}m≥1 is a Cauchy sequence in X. By sequential
compactness we may extract a subsequence {xmk}k≥1 converging to a point x0 ∈X.
We leave it to the reader to show that xm →x0 too, and thus every Cauchy sequence
converges, so X is complete.
To see that X is also totally bounded, assume for the contrary that it is not. Then
there exists an ε0 > 0 such that

for any choice of points x1, . . . , xm ∈X, m ≥1. We now construct the following
sequence. Since X ̸= ∅(otherwise it is totally bounded), choose an arbitrary element
x1 ∈X. Suppose that we had chosen points x1, . . . , xm ∈X with the property that
d(xi, x j) ≥ε0 for all 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m. We can now choose an arbitrary element

and the condition d(xi, x j) ≥ε0 now holds for all 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤m + 1. In this
way we obtain the inﬁnite sequence {xm}m≥1 which, by sequential compactness, has
a convergent subsequence, which thus must be Cauchy. But by the construction of
{xm}m≥1, no subsequence of it is Cauchy, and thus we obtain a contradiction.
Finally, we prove that if X is complete and totally bounded, then X is compact.
Suppose that U is an open covering of X that does not admit a ﬁnite sub-covering.
Our aim will be to construct a non-convergent Cauchy sequence and thus obtain a
contradiction.
Let us call a non-empty subset F ⊆X a problematic set if it is closed and can
not be covered by ﬁnitely many elements from U (so X itself is problematic). By
Corollary 4.9 (applied to X with ε = 1) there exists a problematic set F1 with
diam(F1) < 1. Applying the same corollary again (to F1 and with ε = 1/2) there
exists a problematic set F2 ⊆F1 with diam(F2) < 1/2. Continuing inductively in
this manner we obtain a sequence F1 ⊇F2 ⊇F3 ⊇· · · ⊇Fm ⊇· · · of non-empty
closed sets with diam(Fm) < 1/m, all of which are problematic. Let xm ∈Fm be
an arbitrary element in Fm. The sequence {xm}m≥1 is clearly Cauchy since xk ∈Fm
for all k ≥m and thus d(xk, xk′) < 1/m for all k, k′ > m. To see that the sequence
can not converge assume that xk →x0 for some x0 ∈X. Recalling that every closed
set contains its limit points we see that x0 ∈Fm for all m ≥1 (since xk ∈Fm
for all k ≥m). Further, since U covers X there exists an element U ∈U with
x0 ∈U. Since U is open there exists a δ > 0 with Bδ(x) ⊆U. Let m now be large
enough so that 1/m < δ. We then have that x0 ∈Fm and diam(Fm) < δ and thus
Fm ⊆Bδ(x0) ⊆U. We thus found an element in U which covers Fm, contrary
to Fm being a problematic set. It is thus shown that {xm}m≥1 is a non-convergent
Cauchy sequence, contradicting the completeness of X. The proof is complete.
□
Remark 4.9 We remark again that this result expresses the topological property of
compactness purely in terms of metric notions.

spaces. Some of the generalizations (e.g., [8]) are inspired by problems in physics.
Other generalizations (e.g., [2]) give rise to a unifying perspective on the relationship
between metric spaces and topology (see [9]). For an investigation in the opposite
direction, i.e., metric spaces with special properties, see [7].

Normed Spaces
Abstract Normed spaces are treated at length as well as techniques of Banach
spaces for solving differential and integral equations. Classical results, such as the
Open Mapping Theorem, the Closed Graph Theorem, the Hahn-Banach Theorem,
the Riesz Representation Theorem, and a few more, are given as well, establishing the
core of the theory of bounded operators on Banach spaces. The chapter closes with
a view towards generalizations of the theory in two directions, providing a glimpse
of the theory of unbounded operators and of locally convex spaces.

Normed spaces were introduced in Chap.2. We revisit the deﬁnition here in a broader
context and we study the topology and metric structure of normed spaces. We start
though with the following discussion.
From elementary geometry of the plane, namely Pythagoras’ Theorem, the length,
or norm, of a vector x = (x1, x2) ∈R2 is given by

x2
1 + x2
2. Consider now two
vectors x, y ∈R2. These vectors then determine a triangle with side lengths ∥x∥,
∥y∥, and ∥x −y∥. Let θ be the internal triangle angle formed by x and y. From
elementary trigonometry, namely the law of cosines (which is a generalization of
Pythagoras’ Theorem), the lengths of the sides of the triangle and the angle θ are
related by the formula
∥x −y∥2 = ∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2 −2∥x∥∥y∥cos θ.
Using the above expression for the length of a vector, this formula becomes
(x1 −y1)2 + (x2 −y2)2 = x2

2 + y2
1 + y2
2 −2∥x∥∥y∥cos θ,
which simpliﬁes to
x1y1 + x2y2 = ∥x∥∥y∥cos θ.

Normed Spaces
⟨x, y⟩= ∥x∥∥y∥cos θ
and thus we have discovered the standard inner product and the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality in R2, by elementary geometry.
We thus see that with a sufﬁciently strong geometry (i.e., the presence of angles),
a notion of a norm gives rise to an inner product. Conversely, an inner product gives
rise to a norm by means of ∥x∥= √(x, x), and, via the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,
also gives rise to angles. Quite often though, the geometry present in a linear space
of interest is not so rich that one can speak of angles, but a notion of a norm is still
available. These are the normed spaces, which form the topic of this chapter.
Section5.1 presents the deﬁnition of semi-normed, normed, and Banach spaces,
establishes several fundamental continuity results in general normed spaces, and
establishes the Open Mapping Theorem, a result of great importance. Section5.2
then is an investigation of a powerful technique for solving a problem by recasting
it in the form of a ﬁxed-point problem, and then resorting to Banach’s Fixed-Point
Theorem. This technique is exempliﬁed in detail for the solution of certain classes
of differential and integral equations, namely to Volterra equations and to Fredholm
equations. Section5.3 starts off with a general study of inverse operators, motivated
by an analysis of ﬁxed-point problems, and then proceeds to apply this more power-
ful technique to strengthen the results obtained in the previous section. Section5.4
investigates dual spaces, establishes the Riesz Representation Theorem, presents the
duals of ℓp spaces, and the Hahn-Banach Theorem. The ﬁrst four sections represent
the core material of the theory of bounded linear operators between normed spaces.
Section5.5 is a short introduction to two fruitful directions in which the theory can
be generalized, namely by considering unbounded operators between normed spaces
and by introducing locally convex spaces.
5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
Banach spaces are normed spaces in which the algebra and geometry mesh very well
together, giving rise to powerful theorems. We introduce Banach spaces in a broad
context, starting with general semi-normed and normed spaces, a basic investigation
of the topology of normed spaces, followed by a study of bounded linear operators
and the Open Mapping Theorem.
5.1.1 Semi-Norms and Norms
The notion of a norm on a linear space is an association of lengths to vectors in such
a way that the linear structure is taken into consideration. In practice, for various
reasons, it is convenient to introduce a weaker structure, that of a semi-norm on a
linear space. Every semi-normed space can canonically be turned into a normed one,
and thus one may think of semi-norms as an intermediate step towards obtaining
norms.

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
151
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let V be a linear space over K = R or over K = C. A semi-norm
on V is a function associating with every vector x ∈V a non-negative real number
p(x), the norm of x, for which the following conditions hold.
1. p(αx) = |α|p(x), for all α ∈K and x ∈V .
2. The triangle inequality holds, i.e.,p(x + y) ≤p(x) + p(y), for all x, y ∈V .
If, moreover, p(x) = 0 implies x = 0, for all x ∈V , then the function is called a
norm on V , in which case we write ∥x∥= p(x). A linear space V together with a
semi-norm on it is called a semi-normed space, and a linear space V together with a
norm on it is called a normed space. It is common to refer to a (semi-)normed space
V , leaving p(x), or ∥x∥, implicit.
Example 5.1 Numerous examples of normed spaces were already presented in
Chap.2, so we only consider here semi-norms. Firstly, and quite trivially, any linear
space V supports the trivial semi-norm given by p(x) = 0 for all x ∈V . Less
trivially, consider the linear space C(R, R) of all continuous functions x : R →R.
The evaluation semi-norm is given by ∥x∥= |x(0)|. Indeed
∥αx∥= |αx(0)| = |α||x(0)| = |α|∥x∥
and
∥x + y∥= |x(0) + y(0)| ≤|x(0)| + |y(0)| = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
Note that it is obvious that ∥x∥= 0 need not imply x = 0, only that x(0) = 0, so this
semi-norm is not a norm. This construction is a typical one giving rise to semi-norms
by ignoring some of the information embodied in the vectors (in this case, only x(0)
is important for determining the semi-norm, all the other values of the function are
ignored). Naturally, one may evaluate at any point, not just at x = 0, and obtain a
family of semi-norms.
We mention here that there is another natural way to obtain semi-norms. The
space C([a, b], R) is a space of continuous functions. If one wishes to consider non-
continuous functions and to utilize the integral in order to obtain a norm similar in
spirit to the L∞or L p norms on C([a, b], R), then one encounters the following
difﬁculty. It is well-known that for a non-continuous function x, it is possible that

dt |x(t)| = 0 while x ̸= 0. For instance, if the function is constantly 0 except
at ﬁnitely many points. Thus, by allowing non-continuous functions into our linear
spaces, the insensitivity of the integral to ﬁnite changes in the integrand implies that
norms on such spaces are rare. Semi-norms on such spaces though are available.
We will also see below one more instance where semi-norms arise naturally from
norms, namely when transferring a norm from a space to a quotient of it.
We now describe the process of turning a semi-normed space into a normed one.
This, of course, can not be achieved without paying a price. In this case all non-
zero vectors of norm 0 must be quotiented out of existence. This is a small price to
pay since vectors of norm 0 are, in a sense, negligible. As stated above, this is an

152

Normed Spaces
important method for constructing normed spaces, since in practice it is common to
have a natural choice of a semi-norm on a given space, and then one passes to the
suitable quotient as we now describe.
Theorem 5.1 Let V be a semi-normed space.
1. The set U = {x ∈V | p(x) = 0} is a linear subspace of V .
2. The function
∥x + U∥= p(x)
is well-deﬁned on the quotient space V/U and with it V/U is a normed space.
Proof
1. In a semi-normed space we have p(0) = p(0 · 0) = |0| · p(0) = 0, and thus
0 ∈U, which is thus in particular non-empty. It remains to show that U is closed
under addition and scalar products. Indeed, if x, y ∈U, then
0 ≤p(x + y) ≤p(x) + p(y) = 0 + 0 = 0,
and thus p(x + y) = 0, so that x + y ∈U. Finally, if x ∈U and α ∈K is an
arbitrary scalar, then p(αx) = |α|p(x) = |α| · 0 = 0, so that αx ∈U.
2. To show that x +U →p(x) is well-deﬁned, suppose that x′ +U = x +U. Then
x −x′ ∈U, namely p(x −x′) = 0, and thus
∥x +U∥= p(x) = p((x −x′)+ x′) ≤p(x −x′)+ p(x′) = p(x′) = ∥x′ +U∥.
A similar argument shows that ∥x′ + U∥≤∥x + U∥, and it thus follows that
∥x + U∥= ∥x′ + U∥and thus that x + U →p(x) is independent of the choice
of representative. Next, clearly, ∥x + U∥≥0 for all x + U ∈V/U and
∥α(x + U)∥= ∥αx + U∥= p(αx) = |α|p(x) = |α|∥x + U∥
forallα ∈K and x+U ∈V/U.Asimilarargumentprovesthetriangleinequality.
It remains to show that if ∥x + U∥= 0, then x + U = 0 in the quotient space,
namely that x ∈U. Indeed, since ∥x + U∥= p(x), if ∥x + U∥= 0, then x ∈U
by deﬁnition of U. To conclude, p(x) induces a norm on the quotient space V/U,
as claimed.
□
We already proved that a normed space is automatically endowed with a distance
function. We now extend this simple, yet pivotal, observation to make a connection
between semi-normed spaces and semimetric spaces as well. Recall that a semimetric
space is a set together with a distance function d : X×X →R+ satisfying the axioms
of a metric space, except that it is possible that d(x, y) = 0 for distinct points x and y.
For the reader’s convenience we repeat the statement and the proof for normed spaces
as well.

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
153
Theorem 5.2 Let V be a semi-normed space. Then deﬁning d(x, y) = p(x −y),
for all vectors x, y ∈V , endows V with the structure of a semimetric space. If V is a
normed space, then d(x, y) = p(x −y) = ∥x −y∥endows V with the structure of a
metric space. These are, respectively, the induced semimetric and metric structures.
Proof Clearly d(x, y) ≥0. Symmetry follows by
d(x, y) = p(x −y) = p((−1)(y −x)) = | −1|p(y −x) = d(y, x)
while the triangle inequality follows by
d(x, z) = p(x −z) = p(x −y + y −z) ≤p(x −y)+ p(y −z) = d(x, y)+d(y, z).
Finally, if the semi-norm is in fact a norm, then
d(x, y) = 0 =⇒∥x −y∥= 0 =⇒x −y = 0 =⇒x = y,
completing the proof.
□
Recall that there is a canonical construction for turning a semimetric space into
a metric space. In more detail, if (X, d) is a semimetric space, then deﬁning x ∼y
precisely when d(x, y) = 0, is an equivalence relation on X and the function
d([x], [y]) = d(x, y) is well-deﬁned and turns the quotient set X/∼into a met-
ric space. The next result shows that starting with a semi-normed space, turning it
into a metric space by ﬁrst constructing the associated semimetric and then turning
it into a metric space, or ﬁrst turning it into a normed space and then associating a
metric space with it, yields the same end-result.
Theorem 5.3 Let V be a semi-normed space. Consider the induced normed space
V/U = {x + U | x ∈V }, where U = {x ∈V | p(x) = 0}, and the induced metric
space (V/U, d). Consider next the induced semimetric space (V, d) and the induced
metric space (V/∼, d) where ∼is the equivalence relation on V given by x ∼y
precisely when d(x, y) = 0. Then the two resulting metric spaces are identical.
Proof First we show that the two resulting metric spaces have identical underlying
sets. Indeed, for the second described metric space we consider the quotient set V/∼
where x ∼y if, and only if, d(x, y) = 0. But d(x, y) = p(x −y) and thus x ∼y if,
and only if, x −y ∈U. It follows that [x] = x + U, and thus the quotient set V/∼
coincides with the quotient set construction for V/U. Next we show that the metrics
agree as well. The induced metric on V/U is given by
d(x + U, y + U) = ∥x −y + U∥= p(x −y)
while the metric d on V/∼is given in terms of the semimetric d on V as follows:
d([x], [y]) = d(x, y) = p(x −y).

154

Normed Spaces
The two metrics are thus identical, as claimed.
□
A subspace U of a semi-normed space (V, p) is automatically a semi-normed
space by deﬁning y →p(y) for every y ∈U, using the semi-norm in the ambient
space. Similarly, any subspace U of a normed space (V, ∥·∥) is a normed space with
norm given by y →∥y∥, for all y ∈U. The proofs are immediate. The situation
for quotient spaces is slightly more complicated and we now address it. At this point
topological considerations enter the discussion, and thus we recall that any metric
induces a topology and thus the concepts of topology are available in any normed
space. In particular, we may speak of closed subsets of a normed space V .
Theorem 5.4 Let V be a normed space and U a linear subspace of V . Then the
quotient space V/U, when endowed with the function
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥,
is a semi-normed space. If U is a closed subspace of V , then V/U is in fact a normed
space.
Proof The quotient vector space V/U is the set {x + U | x ∈V } of translations of
U, with the linear operations determined by the representatives. We need to verify
that the proposed formula
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥
satisﬁes the conditions for being a semi-norm. Clearly, p(x + U) ≥0 since it is an
inﬁmum of non-negative real numbers. Given α ∈K and x + U ∈V/U we need to
show that
p(αx + U) = |α|p(x + U).
If α = 0, then
p(αx + U) = p(0 + U) = inf
u∈U ∥u∥= 0
(since 0 ∈U and ∥0∥= 0), and the equality holds. If α ̸= 0, then
p(αx + U) = inf
u∈U ∥αx + u∥= inf
u∈U ∥αx + α 1
α u∥= |α| inf
u∈U ∥x + 1
α u∥
and noting that {(1/α)u}u∈U and {u}u∈U are the same set of vectors, the desired
equality follows. To establish the triangle inequality we need to show that
inf
u∈U ∥x + y + u∥≤inf
u′∈U ∥x + u′∥+ inf
u′′∈U ∥y + u′′∥=
inf
u′,u′′∈U ∥x + u′∥+ ∥y + u′′∥.
It sufﬁces to establish that, given u′, u′′ ∈U,

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
155
inf
u∈U ∥x + y + u∥≤∥x + u′∥+ ∥y + u′′∥,
and indeed,
inf
u∈U ∥x+y+u∥≤∥x+y+(u′+u′′)∥= ∥(x+u′)+(y+u′′)∥≤∥x+u′∥+∥y+u′′∥.
We thus far established that V/U, with the proposed function, is a semi-normed
space. To complete the proof we now show that if U is closed in V , then V/U is in
fact a normed space, namely that for ∥x + U∥= p(x + U), if ∥x + U∥= 0, then
x + U = 0 in the quotient space, that is that x ∈U. So, noting another equivalent
form for the proposed norm, suppose that
∥x + U∥= inf
u∈U ∥u −x∥= 0.
Now, by deﬁnition of inﬁmum, there exists a sequence un ∈U with ∥un −x∥→0.
In other words, d(un, x) →0 and thus un →x in the induced topology. We thus
exhibited x as a limit of a sequence in the closed set U, and thus x itself belongs to
U, as required.
□
To see that if U is not closed then the quotient space may indeed only be a semi-
normed space, consider any normed space V and a dense linear subspace U of it.
The quotient space V/U with the induced semi-norm
p(x + U) = inf
u∈U ∥x + u∥= inf
u∈U ∥u −x∥
allows for p(x +U) = 0 even if x /∈U. In fact, p(x +U) = 0 for all x ∈V , in other
words the induced semi-norm on V/U degenerates to the trivial semi-norm. Indeed,
given x ∈V , choose a sequence in U that converges to x, namely ∥un −x∥→0. In
particular then,
p(x + U) ≤inf
n ∥un −x∥= 0.
5.1.2 Banach Spaces
It can be shown that any ﬁnite-dimensional normed space is complete. However, as
we have seen, an inﬁnite-dimensional normed linear space need not be complete.
Non-complete normed spaces exhibit very pathological behaviour. In some sense,
such spaces are full of holes. In the rest of this chapter we will explore some of
the consequence of the powerful interaction between algebra and topology when a
normed space is also a Banach space, namely a complete metric space.
Deﬁnition 5.2 A normed space which, with the metric induced by the norm, is
complete is called a Banach space. Banach spaces are usually denoted by B. An

156
5
Normed Spaces
inner product space which, with the metric induced by the inner product, is complete
is called a Hilbert space. Hilbert spaces are typically denoted by H .
Example 5.2 We have shown that Rn with the Euclidean metric is complete. Since
the Euclidean metric is induced by the standard inner product on Rn, it follows that
Rn is a Hilbert space. For all 1 ≤p ≤∞the normed space ℓp was shown to be
complete with respect to the induced metric, and thus ℓp is a Banach space. The space
ℓ2 is a Hilbert space since the ℓ2 norm is induced by an inner product. The space
C([a, b], R) with the L∞norm is complete and is thus a Banach space. However,
the pre-L p spaces C([a, b], R) with the L p norm for 1 ≤p < ∞are not Banach
spaces since they are not complete.
Since any metric space has a completion, it is natural to consider the completion
of the non-complete spaces C([a, b], R) (with various norms) in the hope that the
algebraic structure of the space can be extended to the completion so as to obtain a
Banach space. In fact, Exercises 4.39 and 4.40 already accomplish just that, a fact
we record as the following result.
Theorem 5.5 Let V be a linear space.
1. Given an inner product on V , let ˆV be a completion of V with respect to the metric
induced by the norm (induced by the inner product). Then the inner product on
V extends to an inner product on ˆV , making ˆV a Hilbert space.
2. Given a norm on V , let ˆV be a completion of V with respect to the metric induced
by the norm. Then the norm on V extends to a norm on ˆV , making ˆV a Banach
space.
Deﬁnition 5.3 Let 1 ≤p < ∞. A completion of C([a, b], R) with respect to the
L p norm is denoted by L p([a, b], R).
Corollary 5.1 For all 1 ≤p < ∞the space L p([a, b], R) is a Banach space, and
L2([a, b], R) is a Hilbert space.
Remark 5.1 This family of Banach spaces is of great importance in applications of
the general theory to problems in Quantum Mechanics. It should be noted that a more
common route to the deﬁnition of the L p spaces is via measure theory and Lebesgue
integrable functions. We took here a short-cut (of sorts) to the deﬁnition, utilizing
the results on metric spaces established earlier.
Recall that a series ∞
k=1 ak of real or complex numbers is said to converge to s
if the sequence {sm}m≥1 of partial sums, i.e., sm = m
k=1 ak, converges to s. We
thus see that convergence for series is deﬁned in terms of sequences. Moreover,
one can recover the convergence of sequences in terms of that of series, as follows.
Given a sequence {xm}m≥1 consider the series ∞
k=1 ak where ak = xk −xk−1 (and
a1 = x1). The partial sum sm is easily seen to be nothing but xm, and thus if the
series converges, then so does the sequence. Some aspects of the interplay between
sequences and series in R and in C extend to normed spaces, as we now brieﬂy
discuss.

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
157
Deﬁnition 5.4 For elements {am}m≥1 in a normed space V , we say that the series
∞
k=1 ak converges to s ∈V if the sequence of partial sums converges to s with
respect to the norm in V , i.e., when
lim
m→∞∥(
m

k=1
ak) −s∥= 0.
We say that a series
∞

k=1
ak
converges absolutely if the series of real numbers
∞

k=1
∥ak∥
converges.
Recall that if a series ∞
k=1 ak of real (or complex) numbers converges absolutely,
that is if ∞
k=1 |ak| converges, then the original series converges as well. Viewing R
(or C) as a normed space, this result is a special case of the following useful criterion
for a normed space to be a Banach space.
Theorem 5.6 A normed space V is a Banach space if, and only if, the absolute
convergence of a series in V implies its convergence.
The proof is left for the reader as we now turn to show that the algebraic structure in
a normed space interacts well with the metric and topological structures induced by
the norm.
Proposition 5.1 The following assertions hold for any normed space V .
1. The mapping x →∥x∥, as a function V →R, is non-expanding and thus the
norm function is (uniformly) continuous.
2. For any ﬁxed x0 ∈V , the translation mapping x →x0 + x is a global isometry
and a homeomorphism.
3. For any α ∈K with α ̸= 0, the scaling mapping x →αx, as a function V →V ,
is uniformly continuous and a homeomorphism.
4. The mapping (x, y) →x + y, as a function V × V →V , is continuous (and in
fact uniformly continuous when V × V is given the additive product metric).
Proof
1. Referring to Proposition 2.12 we have
dR(∥x∥, ∥y∥) = |∥x∥−∥y∥| ≤∥x −y∥= dV (x, y).

Normed Spaces
2. Since ∥(x0 + x) −(x0 + x′)∥= ∥x −x′∥any translation is an isometry. Further,
the translation x →x0 + x is clearly invertible, its inverse being the translation
x →−x0 + x. An isometry is certainly continuous, and thus any translation is a
continuous function with continuous inverse, and thus a homeomorphism.
3. Since ∥αx −αx′∥= |α|∥x −x′∥, it follows that any scaling mapping is uniformly
continuous. The scaling mapping x →αx is clearly invertible, with inverse the
scaling mapping x →(1/α)x. Any non-zero scaling is thus a continuous function
with a continuous inverse, and thus a homeomorphism.
4. Left for the reader.

5.1.3 Bounded Operators
In the text below, linear operators will typically be denoted by A or B, and their
values on vectors x will be given by, e.g., Ax rather than the more cumbersome
A(x).
The norm ∥x∥in a normed space represents the length of the vector x. Given an
operator A between normed spaces it is thus natural to study the way the operator
affects the norm, that is, how ∥x∥and ∥Ax∥are related. If the operator does not alter
the norm of any vector by more than some constant multiple, then it is said to be
bounded. This class of operators is studied here, showing that for linear operators
the concept of boundedness and of continuity coincide. The main result we establish
is that the collection of bounded linear operators between normed spaces is itself a
normed space, which in fact is a Banach space if the codomain is a Banach space.
Deﬁnition 5.5 An operator A : V →W between normed spaces is called a bounded
operator if there exists a positive real number M such that
∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥
for all x ∈V .
Equivalently, an operator A is bounded if it maps bounded sets in the domain to
bounded sets in the codomain (where a set S of vectors in a normed space is bounded
if there exists a positive M such that ∥s∥≤M for all s ∈S).
Remark 5.2 It is not hard to show that any linear operator between ﬁnite-dimensional
normed spaces is bounded.
Example 5.3 In C([a, b], R), the linear space of continuous functions x : [a, b] →
R with the L∞norm, consider the integral operator:
(Ax)(s) =
b

a
dt K(t, s) x(t),

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
159
with K : [a, b] × [a, b] →R a given continuous function. To see that the operator
A is bounded note that if M = maxt,s∈[a,b] |K(t, s)|, then
∥Ax∥= max
s∈[a,b]

 ≤

x(t)
 = M(b −a)∥x∥.
The following example shows that a very familiar linear operator is not bounded.
Example 5.4 Consider the operator A : C1([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R), where both
the domain and the codomain are given the L∞norm, which maps any continuously
differentiable function x : [0, 1] →R to its derivative, i.e., Ax = dx/dt. The fact
that A is not bounded is seen for example by considering xn(t) = tn, and noting that
∥xn∥= 1 but Axn(t) = ntn−1, and thus ∥Axn∥= n.
Remark 5.3 The failure of the differentiation operator to be bounded is, in a sense, a
reﬂection (or the cause, depending on one’s point-of-view) of the complicated nature
of its inverse operator, namely the non-trivial nature of integration.
As mentioned above, it is the case for linear operators that being continuous and
being bounded are equivalent conditions. In fact, we now show that the interplay
between the linear structure and the topology in a normed space implies a stronger
uniﬁcation of concepts.
Theorem 5.7 The following conditions for a linear operator A : V →W between
normed spaces are equivalent.
1. A is uniformly continuous.
2. A is continuous.
3. A is continuous at x = 0.
4. A is bounded.
Proof Obviously, uniform continuity implies continuity, and continuity implies con-
tinuity at x = 0. Suppose now that A is continuous at x = 0. Then there exists a
δ > 0 such that ∥Ax∥≤1 for all x ∈V with ∥x∥< 2δ. Now, given an arbitrary
y ∈V , if y = 0, then Ay = 0 while if y ̸= 0, then, noting that ∥δy/∥y∥∥= δ < 2δ,
one obtains that
∥Ay∥= ∥Aδ∥y∥y
δ∥y∥∥= ∥y∥
δ ∥A δy
∥y∥∥≤1
δ ∥y∥,
showing that A is bounded by 1/δ. Finally, if A is bounded by some M > 0, then
∥Ax −Ax′∥= ∥A(x −x′)∥≤M∥x −x′∥, for all x, x′ ∈V , and thus uniform
continuity follows easily.
□

Normed Spaces
For a bounded operator A, the inequality ∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥sets an upper bound on
how much A can lengthen vectors in the domain. It is natural to consider the inﬁmum
over all such upper bounds M and deﬁne that to be the norm of the operator A.
Deﬁnition 5.6 Let A : V →W be a linear operator. The operator norm or simply
the norm of A is deﬁned to be
∥A∥= inf{M ≥0 | ∀x ∈V
∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥},
adopting the convention that inf ∅= ∞.
Thus, a linear operator is bounded if, and only if, its norm is ﬁnite.
The homogeneity of the norm with respect to the scalar product, and continuity
considerations, give rise to the following ways of computing the operator norm.
Proposition 5.2 For a bounded linear operator A : V →W between normed
spaces, the following expressions are all equal to ∥A∥.
1. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥≤1}.
2. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥< 1}.
3. sup{∥Ax∥| x ∈V,
∥x∥= 1}.
4. sup{∥Ax∥/∥x∥| x ∈V,
x ̸= 0}.
The proof is left for the reader.
In general, any bounded operator, simply since it is continuous, is determined by
its values on a dense subset. However, not any bounded operator on a dense subset
can be extended to the full domain. The next result shows that when the codomain
is a Banach space this difﬁculty disappears.
Theorem 5.8 Let V be a normed space, D ⊆V a dense linear subspace of V ,
and B a Banach space. If A : D →B is a bounded linear operator, then there
exists a unique linear operator B : V →B such that Bx = Ax for all x ∈D and
∥B∥= ∥A∥. Such a B is called an extension of A.
Proof Given x0 ∈V let {xm}m≥1 be a sequence in D with xm →x0, and thus in
particular, {xm}m≥1 is Cauchy. Recall that a bounded linear operator is in particular
a uniformly continuous function, and that uniformly continuous functions preserve
Cauchy sequences. Hence A preserves Cauchy sequences, and thus the sequence
{Axm}m≥1 in B is Cauchy. Since B is complete there exists an element y0 ∈B with
Axm →y0. Suppose now that {x′
m}m≥1 is another sequence in D with x′
m →x0,
and suppose Ax′
m →y′
0. Utilizing the continuity of the norm, it follows that
∥y0 −y′
0∥= ∥lim
m→∞(Axm −Ax′
m)∥= lim
m→∞∥Axm −Ax′
m∥≤
≤∥A∥∥lim
m→∞(xm −x′
m)∥= ∥A∥∥x −x∥= 0
and thus y0 = y′
0. Setting Bx0 = y0 is thus well-deﬁned and we obtain a function
B : V →B. Obviously, for x ∈D we may choose xm = x and then

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
161
Bx = lim
m→∞Axm = Ax
showing that B extends A.
That B is linear is seen as follows. If x, y ∈V and xm →x and ym →y as
above, then it follows that xm + ym →x + y and thus
B(x + y) = lim
m→∞A(xm + ym) = lim
m→∞Axm + lim
m→∞Aym = Bx + By.
A similar argument shows that B(αx) = α(Bx). As for showing that ∥A∥= ∥B∥,
note ﬁrst that ∥A∥≤∥B∥just by the fact that B is an extension of A. Next, for x ∈V
and xm →x0 as above, one has
∥Axm∥≤∥A∥∥xm∥
and passing to the limit, and remembering that the norm is continuous, we obtain
∥Bx∥≤∥A∥∥x∥
showing that ∥B∥≤∥A∥, and thus the desired equality holds. Finally, if C is any
bounded linear extension of A, then it is continuous and agrees with A on a dense
subset. But any two continuous mappings that agree on a dense subset are equal,
hence B = C, showing that B is the unique linear bounded extension of A to all
of V .
□
5.1.4 The Open Mapping Theorem
A continuous function between topological spaces need not be open (i.e., it need
not send open subsets to open subsets). We now show that surjectivity is a sufﬁcient
condition for a bounded linear operator between Banach spaces to be open. The
result is due to Stefan Banach and is our ﬁrst example of a deep result in the theory
of Banach spaces, one with profound consequences.
The technical heart of the argument is stated as a separate lemma. Its proof is
omitted in favour of a more conceptual presentation of the the main result. We refer
the reader to any text dedicated to Banach spaces in order to ﬁll-in the details and
obtain a fully rigorous proof.
It will be convenient to introduce the notation 0V (s) = {x ∈V | ∥x∥< s}, the
open ball in a normed space V with centre the zero vector 0 and radius s > 0. We
further write n · 0V (s) for the point-wise scaling of 0V (s) by n, namely
n · 0V (s) = {nx | x ∈0V (s)} = 0V (ns).

Normed Spaces
Lemma 5.1 Let A : B →V be a bounded linear operator from a Banach space
B to a normed space V . It then follows that if r, s > 0 are such that
0V (s) ⊆A(0B(r)),
then
0V (s) ⊆A(0B(r)).
Theorem 5.9 (Open Mapping Theorem) A bounded surjective linear operator
A : B1 →B2 between Banach spaces is an open mapping.
Proof Let U ⊆B1 be an open set, which we may assume is non-empty. For some
x0 ∈U, let us consider Ax0, an arbitrary element in A(U). As U is open, let ε > 0
be such that Bε(x0) ⊆U, and notice that Bε(x0) = 0B1(ε) + x0, i.e., a ball with
centre x0 is the x0 translation of a ball centered at the origin. By linearity of A we
then have
A(U) ⊇A(x0 + 0B1(ε)) = Ax0 + A(0B1(ε)).
Thus the proof is reduced to showing that for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such
that 0B2(δ) ⊆A(0B1(ε)), since then
A(U) ⊇Ax0 + 0B2(δ) = Bδ(Ax0)
and thus Ax0 is an interior point of A(U). As Ax0 was arbitrary, every point of A(U)
is interior, and thus A(U) is open.
We thus ﬁx an open ball 0B1(ε), ε > 0, denote X = A(0B1(ε)), and we seek out
a δ > 0 for which 0B2(δ) ⊆X. Noting that
B1 =

n≥1
n · 0B1(ε)
the surjectivity and homogeneity of A implies that
B2 = A(B1) =

n≥1
n · X.
Taking closures and applying Baire’s Theorem, there exists an n ≥1 such that n · X
contains an open ball. In other words, there exists a δ > 0 such that Bδ(y) ⊆n · X.
We omit some details on translations and scaling which are used to conclude that in
fact from Bδ(y) ⊆n · X it follows that 0B2(δ/n) ⊆X. Lemma 5.1 then concludes
the proof.
□
The next result is an immediate corollary of the Open Mapping Theorem, illustrating
some of the taming effect of the completeness requirement on Banach spaces.

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
163
Corollary 5.2 If a bounded linear operator A : B1 →B2 between banach spaces
is invertible, then its inverse A−1 is also a bounded linear operator.
Proof By Proposition 2.8, the inverse of a linear operator is itself linear. It remains
to show that A−1 is continuous, namely that (A−1)−1(U) is an open set whenever
U is open. Since (A−1)−1 = A, we need to show that A(U) is open whenever U is
open, namely that A is an open mapping. Indeed, since A is invertible it is necessarily
surjective, and thus A is an open mapping by the Open Mapping Theorem.
□
5.1.5 Banach Spaces of Linear and Bounded Operators
We end this section by studying the set B(V, W) of all bounded linear operators
A : V →W between normed spaces. The main result is that when endowed with the
operator norm one obtains a normed space, which, furthermore, is a Banach space
provided the codomain is a Banach space.
Theorem 5.10 Let A, B : V →W be bounded linear operators between normed
spaces. Then
1. ∥A∥= 0 if, and only if, A = 0.
2. ∥αA∥= |α|∥A∥for all scalars α.
3. ∥A + B∥≤∥A∥+ ∥B∥.
Proof
1. If A = 0 then ∥Ax∥≤0 · ∥x∥and thus ∥A∥= 0. Conversely, if ∥A∥= 0, then
∥Ax∥≤∥A∥∥x∥= 0 and thus Ax = 0, for all x ∈V .
2. ∥αA∥= sup∥x∥=1 ∥αAx∥= |α| sup∥x∥=1 ∥Ax∥= |α|∥A∥.
3. ∥A + B∥= sup∥x∥=1 ∥(A + B)x∥≤sup∥x∥=1(∥Ax∥+ ∥Bx∥) = ∥A∥+ ∥B∥.
□
Recall Theorem 2.3, stating that for linear spaces V and W the set Hom(V, W) of
all linear operators A : V →W is a linear space.
Theorem 5.11 For normed spaces V and W, the set B(V, W) is a linear subspace
of Hom(V, W) which, when endowed with the operator norm, is a normed space.
Proof Theorem 5.10 states that B(V, W) contains 0 and is closed under addition
and scalar multiplication, and is thus a linear subspace of Hom(V, W). Further, the
same theorem establishes the axioms of a normed space for the operator norm on
B(V, W), and the claim follows.
□
Since B(V, W) is a normed space, it is also a metric space and thus a corresponding
notion of convergence for operators is automatic.

164
5
Normed Spaces
Deﬁnition 5.7 (Operator Norm Convergence or Strong Convergence) Let V and
W be normed spaces. Given a sequence {Am}m≥1 of operators in B(V, W), we say
that {Am}m≥1 converges strongly or converges in the operator norm to an operator
A0 ∈B(V, W) if ∥Am −A0∥→0 (equivalently, when Am →A0 with respect to
the metric induced by the operator norm).
A weaker notion of convergence is also available in the space B(V, W).
Deﬁnition 5.8 Let V and W be normed spaces. We say that a sequence {Am}m≥1 of
operators in the space B(V, W) converges point-wise to an operator A0 ∈B(V, W)
if Amx →A0x for all x ∈V .
Since ∥Amx −A0x∥≤∥Am −A0∥∥x∥it follows that strong convergence implies
point-wise convergence. That the converse may fail is illustrated next.
Example 5.5 Consider the sequence of linear operators Fm : ℓ2 →C (linear op-
erators whose codomain is the ground ﬁeld are called linear functionals and are
studied in detail below), given by Fmx = xm, that is Fm is the projection of the m-th
coordinate, and thus is clearly a linear operator. Since
∥Fmx∥= |xm| ≤∥x∥
we see that ∥Fm∥≤1 and thus Fm is bounded (and in fact ∥Fm∥= 1, since there
clearly exist x ∈ℓ2 with ∥Fmx∥= ∥x∥).
We claim that Fm →0 point-wise, i.e., that Fmx →0 for all x ∈ℓ2. Indeed, for
x ∈ℓ2 one has
∞

m=1
|xm|2 < ∞
and consequently, xm →0. But xm = Fmx, and the claim follows. However, as
noted, ∥Fm∥= 1 and thus {Fm}m≥1 does not converge strongly to 0, or to any other
vector.
Finally, we prove the completeness of B(V, B) when the codomain is complete.
Theorem 5.12 Let B be a Banach space and V an arbitrary normed space. Then
the linear space B(V, B), endowed with the operator norm, is a Banach space.
Proof We already know that with the operator norm B(V, B) is a normed space,
so it remains to show that it is complete. Consider a Cauchy sequence {Am}m≥1.
Since ∥Akx −Amx∥≤∥Ak −Am∥∥x∥−→0 for all x ∈V , it follows at once that
{Amx}m≥1 is also a Cauchy sequence, and, as B is complete, Amx →y. We thus
deﬁne A0(x) = y and obtain the function A0 : V →B which we proceed to show
is a bounded linear operator.
The linearity of A0 follows by standard limit arguments. For instance, continuity
of vector addition implies that
A0(x + x′) = lim
m→∞Am(x + x′) = lim
m→∞Amx + lim
m→∞Amx′ = Ax + Ax′,

5.1 Semi-Norms, Norms, and Banach Spaces
165
and thus A0 is additive. A similar argument shows A0 is homogenous. To show that
A0 is bounded, we use the continuity of the norm to obtain that
∥Ax∥= ∥lim
m→∞Amx∥= lim
m→∞∥Amx∥≤lim
m→∞∥Am∥∥x∥≤M∥x∥
where M is any upper bound of the sequence ∥Am∥(which exists since any Cauchy
sequence is bounded).
Lastly, we verify that Am →A0 in the operator norm. Given ε > 0, using the
Cauchy condition, there exists an N ∈N such that ∥Am −Ak∥< ε for all m, k > N.
In particular, for all x ∈V ,
∥(Am −Ak)x∥≤∥Am −Ak∥∥x∥< ε∥x∥,
for all m, k ≥N. When k tends to ∞we thus obtain
∥(Am −A0)x∥≤ε∥x∥
for all x ∈V and thus
∥Am −A0∥≤ε
for all m > N. In other words, ∥Am −A0∥→0, as required.

5.2 Fixed-Point Techniques in Banach Spaces
Since a Banach space B is in particular a complete and non-empty metric space, the
Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (Theorem 4.8) guarantees that any contraction on B
admits a unique ﬁxed-point. In more detail, a contraction on a Banach space B is a
function (not necessarily linear) F : B →B such that there exists 0 < α < 1 with
∥Fx −Fy∥≤α∥x −y∥.
The guaranteed unique ﬁxed-point for F is an element x0 ∈B with F(x0) = x0.
From the proof of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, the ﬁxed-point x0 is obtained
as the limit xk →x0 where xk+1 = F(xk), and x1 ∈B is an arbitrary element.
It follows that any problem in a Banach space B whose solution can be expressed
as a ﬁxed-point for a contraction on B can be solved iteratively. We explore this
technique in three different scenarios, namely for solving systems of linear equations,
for solving ﬁrst order differential equations, and for solving integral equations.
Remark 5.4 Notice that the more general problem
x0 = F(x0) + b
is subsumed by the technique described above since for Fb(x) = F(x) + b one has
that
∥Fb(x) −Fb(y)∥= ∥F(x) −F(y)∥
and thus F is a contraction if, and only if, Fb is a contraction. Moreover, a ﬁxed-point
for Fb is precisely a solution of the equation x0 = F(x0) + b. It is customary to
simplify the notation and write x = Fx + b. Notice that if F is a linear operator,
then F is a contraction if, and only if, ∥F∥< 1.
5.2.1 Systems of Linear Equations
Consider a linear system of n equations in n unknowns:
n

i=1
aki xi = bk,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

5.2 Fixed-Point Techniques in Banach Spaces
167
In terms of operators this system of equations can be written as Ax = b, where A is
the corresponding n ×n matrix of coefﬁcients viewed as a linear operator Rn →Rn,
with x = (x1, . . . , xn) representing the unknown vector, and b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn)
the vector of free coefﬁcients. Theoretically precise methods for solving such sys-
tems of linear equations are computationally demanding. For instance, Cramer’s
rule requires the computation of n2 determinants, and thus, for large n, this becomes
unfeasible. Moreover, numerical difﬁculties resulting from rounding may render
some computation techniques unreliable. We now investigate the applicability of an
iterative ﬁxed-point technique in this case. Such a solution is often more robust than
naive applications of theoretical exact solutions (though we will not delve into a
numerical analysis of the solution here).
Since Ax = b if, and only if, x = (−A + In)x + b, where In is the n × n identity
matrix, we are led to consider the equation
x = Fx + b
where F = −A + In. The original problem is equivalent to the ﬁxed-point problem
x = Fbx
where Fbx = Fx + b = (−A + In)x + b is viewed as an operator Fb : Rn →Rn.
Let us assume some norm on Rn is chosen. For the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to
be applicable, Fb must be a contraction, and since F is a linear operator we must
examine the norm ∥F∥. In particular, if ∥F∥< 1, then F, and thus Fb, is a contraction
and the original problem is amenable to the iterative solution xk+1 = Fbxk with an
arbitrary initial value x1 ∈Rn.
Whether F is a contraction is typically strongly dependent on the chosen norm
for the ambient space Rn. We consider two cases below, recalling that the Kronecker
δ function is given by
δk,i =
	
1 if k = i,
0 if k ̸= i.
Example 5.6 Consider Rn with the ℓ∞norm: ∥x∥= max1≤k≤n |xk|. Then, for any

Thus, if the inequality

holds, then the operator C is a contraction. Returning to the system Ax = b and

5.2.2 Cauchy’s Problem and the Volterra Equation
Consider Cauchy’s problem for the ﬁrst order differential equation:
dx
dt (t) = f [t, x(t)] with
x(t0) = x0.
The associated integral equation

5.2 Fixed-Point Techniques in Banach Spaces
169
x(t) =
t
t0
ds f [s, x(s)] + x0
is called a Volterra integral equation. Suppose that, for |t −t0| ≤ε and |x −x0| ≤η,
the function f (t, x) is continuous and | f (t, x)| < M. Noting that a solution of the
Volterra equation is also a solution to the original Cauchy problem, we introduce the
operator
(Bx)(t) =
t
t0
ds f [ s, x(s)] + x0
since its ﬁxed-points are precisely solutions to the Volterra equation. If B can be seen
to be an operator
B : C(I, R) →C(I, R)
for a suitable interval I ⊆[a, b], and if B is moreover a contraction with respect
to some norm, then locally Cauchy’s problem has a unique solution, which, starting
with an arbitrary x0, may be computed iteratively:
x1(t) =
t
t0
ds f (s, x0) + x0, x2(t) =
t
t0
ds f [ s, x1(s)] + x0, . . . , xn(t) = . . .
Since the norm we choose must turn the space C(I, R) into a Banach space (since
otherwise Banach’s Fixed-Point Theorem does not apply) the only norm of those
encountered so far that we can consider is the L∞norm (and now the importance
of the L p spaces becomes apparent as they are complete and thus they allow one to
consider other norms).
Let us examine under which assumptions is it guaranteed that B is a contraction
for a suitable interval. Consider C(I, R) where I = [t0 −ε, t0 +ε] and choose some
interval J = [x0 −η, x0 + η] contained in I. We seek to identify conditions on ε,
η, and M that will assure the existence of a solution, at least locally. We note the
following.
1. The function Bx is certainly a continuous function, given the assumptions on
f [t, s].
2.

t∈I, x∈J | f (t, x)| ≤εM.

Normed Spaces
We thus see that the operator B transforms the restriction of x to J into a function
taking values in J provided that ε ≤η/M, a condition we now assume is met.
3. For all x, y ∈J we have that
∥Bx −By∥≤max
t∈I
t
t0
ds
 f [ s, x(s)] −f [ s, y(s)]
.
4. Suppose the function f (t, x) is not just continuous and bounded, but also satisﬁes
the Lipschitz condition:
 f (t, x) −f (t, y)
 ≤K|x −y|, ∀x, y ∈J,
uniformly for all t ∈I. Then
∥Bx −By∥≤max


≤Kε max
s∈I
x(s) −y(s)
 = Kε∥x −y∥, ∀x, y ∈J.
Collecting these observations together we conclude that if ε ≤η/M and ε ≤1/K,
then the operator B is a contraction and Cauchy’s problem has one, and only one,
solution inside the reduced interval I = [t0 −ε, t0 + ε], with ε ≤min(η/M, 1/K).
Furthermore, the solution can be obtained iteratively as a ﬁxed-point solution of the
associated Volterra equation.
5.2.3 Fredholm Equations
The Volterra equations, considered above, are examples of integral equations with
variable limits. We now turn to consider Fredholm equations, which belong to the
family of integral equations with ﬁxed limits.
First consider the general form of a non-linear Fredhom equation
x(t) = λ


t, s, x(s)

= [Ax](t),
where we consider A as an operator, and we seek to identify conditions under which
the iterative ﬁxed-point method is applicable. Let K(t, s, x) be a continuous function
in [a, b] × [a, b] × [−η, η] and bounded by M > 0. Let J = [−η, η] and consider

5.2 Fixed-Point Techniques in Banach Spaces

C(J, R) with the L∞norm. Noticing that
∥Ax∥≤max
t∈[a,b]
λ


a
ds K

t, s, x(s)
 ≤|λ|M(b −a)
we see that if |λ| ≤η/

M(b −a)

, then ∥Ax∥≤η and so the operator A is
well-deﬁned when restricting to the interval J. Furthermore,
∥Ax −Ay∥= max

.
If we also make the assumption that the function K(t, s, x) is Lipschitz with respect
to x, uniformly in the square [a, b] × [a, b], with Lipschitz constant K, then:
∥Ax −Ay∥≤|λ|(b −a)K max
s∈[a,b] |x(s) −y(s)| ≤|λ|(b −a)K ∥x −y∥.
It thus follows that if |λ|(b −a)K < 1, then the operator A is a contraction, and
thus the original non-linear Fredholm equation has a unique solution, obtained by
the iterative scheme
xn+1(t) =
b

a
ds K


with x0(t) an arbitrary continuous function on [a, b], satisfying maxt |x0(t)| ≤η.
The condition
|λ|(b −a) ≤min{η/M, 1/K}
guarantees the applicability of the iterative solution.
Consider now the linear Fredholm equation:
x(t) = λ
b

a
ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t),
with λ a real parameter, f (t) a continuous function in [a, b] and K(t, s) continuous
in the square [a, b] × [a, b] and bounded by M > 0. Still considering C([a, b], R)
with the L∞norm, consider the operator

(Bx)(t) = λ

ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t).

and thus, for |λ| < 1/[M(b −a)], the operator B is a contraction and the uniform
limit (i.e., with respect to the L∞norm) of the iterative process
xn+1(t) = λ


a
ds K(t, s)xn(s) + f (t) = . . .
exists and gives the solution to the given Fredholm equation. A possible choice of
the initial function is given by x0(t) = f (t).
Example 5.8 Consider in C([0, 1], R) the Fredholm equation:
x(t) = λ
1

0
ds tsx(s) + αt,
with α a real parameter. Since maxt,s∈[0,1] K(t, s) = 1 and (b −a) = 1, it follows
that for |λ| < 1/

M(b −a)

= 1 the operator is a contraction and one can solve the
problem by successive approximations:
x0 = α t = α0 t, x1 = λ

xn+1 = λ

0
ds (t s) (αn s) = (α + αn λ/3) t = αn+1 t, . . .
For |λ| < 1 the limit x = limn→∞xn exists and thus also β = limn→∞αn exists.
When passing to the limit in the last equality we obtain that α + βλ/3 = β, from
which we conclude that β = 3α/(3 −λ) and, ﬁnally, that x(t) = 3α/(3 −λ)t.
We got this solution by assuming |λ| < 1, but one can easily see that the limit of αn
as n →∞also exists if |λ| < 3, as suggested by the last relation. In fact:

1 + λ/3 + (λ/3)2 + · · · + (λ/3)n+1
=⇒
αn(t) →3α/(3 −λ)
for
|λ| < 3.
The condition |λ| < 1 is a sufﬁcient condition for the convergence of the iterative
process which, as just seen, has a broader domain of convergence. More generally,
the function x(t) found above is actually a solution of the original problem for every
λ ̸= 3, as is easily checked with a test function x(t) = γ t, with γ unknown.

5.3 Inverse Operators
From Chap.2 we know that if a linear operator A : V →W admits an inverse
function A−1 : W →V , then that function is automatically a linear operator.
The Open Mapping Theorem implies that if the linear spaces are Banach spaces
and the operator is bounded, then its inverse is also bounded. In this section we will
establish a condition on A that guarantees the existence of a bounded inverse without
assuming the spaces are Banach. We will them obtain a simple yet powerful result
which presents the inverse of an operator in terms of a convergent series of operators.
The analysis will reveal the close connection between invertibility and ﬁxed-point
solutions. We will then have a second, deeper, look at the Volterra and Fredholm
equations in light of the results below.
5.3.1 Existence of Bounded Inverses
We present conditions that guarantee the existence of inverse operators, providing
estimates for their norm, and, under suitable conditions, we obtain the inverse as the
sum of a strongly convergent series.
Theorem 5.13 Let A : V →W be a bounded surjective linear operator between
normed spaces. Then A is invertible with bounded inverse A−1 if, and only if, there
exists a constant C > 0 such that ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥, for all x ∈V . Moreover, with such
a constant C the operator norm of the inverse satisﬁes ∥A−1∥≤1/C.
Proof Suppose that ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥holds. Then if Ax = 0, then 0 = ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥,
and thus x = 0. In other words, Ker(A) = {0}, and thus A is injective. Since it is
given that A is surjective, we conclude that A is invertible and that its inverse A−1
is automatically a linear operator. Moreover, for all y ∈W let x ∈V with Ax = y,
and thus x = A−1y. We then have

5.3 Inverse Operators
175
∥y∥= ∥Ax∥≥C∥x∥= C∥A−1y∥,
showing that ∥A−1∥≤1/C. In the other direction, suppose that A−1 exists and is
bounded. Then, for all x ∈V
∥x∥= ∥A−1 Ax∥≤∥A−1∥∥Ax∥.
Noticing that the norm of an invertible operator is strictly positive, we conclude that
∥Ax∥≥
1
∥A−1∥∥x∥
and thus we may take C = 1/∥A−1∥.
□
Consider now an in-homogenous ﬁxed-point problem x = Ax + b, where A : B →
B is a linear operator on a Banach space B. As we know, if A is a contraction,
namely if ∥A∥< 1, then a unique solution exists. Notice though that the problem
may be re-written as (I −A)x = b, where we write I for the identity operator on B.
Now, if (I −A) is invertible, then we obtain the unique solution x = (I −A)−1b.
Since the latter does not rely on the norm it actually holds in any linear space. We
thus have two criteria for the solution of the equation x = Ax + b, one is that A be
a contraction and the other is that I −A be invertible. The next result shows that the
former implies the latter, when the ambient space is a Banach space.
Proposition 5.3 Let A : B →B be a linear operator on a Banach space B. If
∥A∥< 1, then I −A is invertible. Moreover, ∥(I −A)−1∥≤1/(1 −∥A∥).
Proof Since ∥Ax∥≤∥A∥∥x∥, if follows that
∥(I −A)x∥= ∥x −Ax∥≥∥x∥−∥Ax∥≥∥x∥−∥A∥∥x∥= (1 −∥A∥)∥x∥,
and the claim would follow from Theorem 5.13 if we can show that I −A is surjective.
In other words, given y ∈W, we wish to solve the equation
(I −A)x = y,
or, equivalently, the equation
x = Ax + y.
But this is precisely an in-homogenous ﬁxed-point problem, and since A is assumed
to be a contraction, a solution exists.
□
We thus see that the invertibility of I −A is important for the solution of ﬁxed-point
problems, and thus, as we saw above, to the solution of systems of linear equations,
differential equations, and integral equations (and other problems as well which we
did not mention). While the condition ∥A∥< 1 gives a sufﬁcient condition for the

176
5
Normed Spaces
existence of (I −A)−1, it does not provide us with any feasible means of obtaining
the inverse. The following result remedies the situation.
Deﬁnition 5.9 Let A : V →V be a linear operator on a normed space V . The series
∞
k=0 Ak, where A0 is interpreted as the identity operator, is called the Neumann
series of A.
Recall the notation B(V, W) for the set of all bounded linear operators A :
V →W. When V = W we will write B(V ) instead of B(V, W). Similarly, for a
Banach space B, we write B(B) instead of B(B, B).
Theorem 5.14 Let A : V →V be a linear operator on a normed space V . If the
Neumann series for A converges in the operator norm, then the Neumann series is
the inverse of I −A.
Proof Suppose that the Neumann series converges to the operator S, that is
S = lim
m→∞
m

k=0
Ak
with respect to the operator norm in the space B(V ). Now, since
(I −A)
m

k=0
Ak = I −Am+1,
when m tends to ∞we obtain
(I −A)
∞

k=0
Ak = I −lim
m→∞Am+1.
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to verify that if the Neumann series of A
converges, then Am →0 in the operator norm, and thus we see that the Neumann
series is a right inverse of I −A. A similar agument shows it is also a left inverse,
and the proof is complete.
□
The expected sufﬁcient condition on an operator A on a Banach space guaranteeing
the convergence of the Neumann series is given in the next result.
Corollary 5.3 Let A : B →B be a linear operator on a Banach space B with
∥A∥< 1. Then the Neumann series of A converges, and in particular
(I −A)−1 =
∞

k=0
Ak,
where the series converges in the operator norm.

5.3 Inverse Operators
177
Proof All we have to do is establish the convergence in B(B) of the Neumann series.
Since B is a Banach space, so is the space B(B). Using Theorem 5.6, it sufﬁces
to show the convergence of the series ∞
k=0 ∥Ak∥. But ∥Ak∥≤∥A∥k and thus the
latter series is majorized by ∞
k=0 ∥A∥k, which converges since 0 ≤∥A∥< 1.
□
Corollary 5.4 If A is as above and λ ∈R is such that ∥λA∥= |λ|∥A∥< 1, then
I −λA is invertible and its inverse is given by the Neumann series
(I −λA)−1 =
∞

k=0
λk Ak.
5.3.2 Fixed-Point Techniques Revisited
The ﬁxed-point techniques given in Sect.5.2 relied on point-wise convergence. The
convergence of the Neumann series though is strong convergence (i.e., in the operator
norm), a form of convergence much stronger than point-wise convergence. We thus
expect to have greater control over the situation when the Neumann series can be
brought into the playground when solving a ﬁxed-point problem. We now look again
at some of the differential and integral equations we solved above and witness the
enhancement due to the strong convergence.
Example 5.9 Consider the linear Fredholm equation
x(t) = λ
b

a
ds K(t, s)x(s) + f (t) = λAx + f
with K(t, s), known as the nucleus, continuous in the square [a, b]×[a, b], and f (t)
continuous in the interval [a, b]. Since
|K(t, s)| ≤M
=⇒
∥A∥≤|λ|M(b −a) = q
we see that for those values of λ such that q < 1, the Neumann series

Notice further that for all t, s ∈[a, b]
|λi Ki(t, s)| ≤|λ|i Mi(b −a)i ≤qi,
and, since 0 ≤q < 1 by assumption, the series
K(t, s; λ) =
∞

i=1
λi Ki(t, s),
converges uniformly in [a, b]×[a, b]. The function K(t, s; λ) is called the resolvent
nucleus and is a continuous function in the square [a, b] × [a, b] (as a uniform limit
of continuous functions). From here it follows that
x(t) = f (t) +

and thus we can perform the same series expansion as above. The resolvent nucleus
is now given by

Let us now reconsider the Volterra equation, in light of the more powerful technique
of the Neumann series.
Example 5.11 Consider in C([a, b], R) the linear Volterra equation
x(t) = λ
t
a
ds K(t, s) x(s) + f (t) = λAx + f,
with the usual assumption of continuity and boundedness on K(t, s) and f (t), and let
M =
max
{t,s}∈[a,b] |K(t, s)|,
F = max
t∈[a,b] | f (t)|.
Compared with the previous treatment of the Fredholm equation by means of point-
wise ﬁxed-point solutions, here the integral does not extend over the entire interval
[a, b] but only up to t, which in turn becomes the integration variable of the next
iteration. Since usually integration makes functions smoother, we expect to obtain
better conditions on the values of λ for which the iterative solution is converging.
Then, consider the solution
x(t) =
∞

i=0
λi Ai f =


i=0
λiφi,
which certainly exists at least for those values of λ found for the linear Fredholm
equation. The following estimates hold

solutions other than the zero solution. Given the equation

The coefﬁcients of similar terms in t must be equal, so that
	
c1 = λ c1/2 + λ c2
c2 = λ c1/3 + λ c2/2.

c1 =

was done in order to allow for the machinery developed thus far. It should be noted
though that this does not exclude the existence of non-continuous solutions, i.e., ones
that we have excluded a priori.

5.4 Dual Spaces
Let us brieﬂy recall the fundamentals of duality for ﬁnite dimensional linear spaces,
where for simplicity we take the ground ﬁeld to be R. The dual space of a ﬁnite
dimensional linear space V is the linear space V ∗= Hom(V, R) of all linear oper-
ators A : V →R, where R is viewed as a linear space over itself in the usual way.
Given a basis for V , one can associate with it its dual basis, which is then a basis for
V ∗, in particular showing that V and V ∗have the same dimension, and thus they are
isomorphic.
When considering these results in the inﬁnite dimensional setting there are two
immediate issues. The ﬁrst is in the choice of linear operators V →R, namely do
we consider all linear operators or only the bounded ones. The second issue is that
results about the dual space that depend on a basis, for most inﬁnite dimensional
linear spaces, are only theoretical (since bases, while they exist, are often impossible
to exhibit explicitly).
With that in mind, we deﬁne the dual space in the inﬁnite dimensional context and
we prove three major results. First is the Riesz Representation Theorem which gives
a complete characterization of the dual space of any Hilbert space. Then we compute
some duals related to the ℓp spaces, and ﬁnally we have a look at the Hahn-Banach
Theorem (necessarily only a brief look, since a full treatment can easily ﬁll an entire
chapter).
5.4.1 Linear Functionals and the Riesz Representation Theorem
We now deﬁne linear functionals and the dual space of a general linear space, study
several examples, and then establish the most general form of a bounded linear
functional on a Hilbert space.
Deﬁnition 5.10 Alinearfunctional onanormedspace V isalinearoperator V →K
to the ground ﬁeld K, thus either K = R or K = C. The set of all bounded linear
functionals F : V →K is denoted by V ∗and is called the dual space of V .
Of course, the general theory of linear operators specializes to linear functionals. In
particular,

Normed Spaces
1. The norm of a linear functional F ∈V ∗is given by
∥F∥= sup
∥x∥≤1
|F(x)|
(or any of the other equivalent expressions given in Proposition 5.2).
2. A linear functional is continuous if, and only if, it is bounded.
3. V ∗is a Banach space.
Example 5.14 Consider C([a, b], R) with the L∞norm, i.e., ∥x∥= maxt∈[a,b]
{|x(t)|}. The deﬁnite integral
F(x) =
b

a
dt x(t)
deﬁnes a linear functional on V . Indeed, linearity follows by fundamental properties
of integration, and as for the norm of F, the inequality
|F(x)| ≤
b

a
dt |x(t)| ≤(b −a) max
a≤t≤b |x(t)| = (b −a)∥x∥
shows that ∥F∥≤b −a. In fact, consideration of the constant function x(t) = 1,
shows that ∥F∥= b −a.
Example 5.15 The previous example easily generalizes as follows. Still consid-
ering C([a, b], R) with the L∞norm, suppose a function y(t) is given which
is integrable over [a, b]. Then, integrating against y gives rise to the function
Fy : C([a, b], R) →R given by
Fy(x) =
b

a
dt y(t) x(t)
(the previous example is the case y(t) = 1). The veriﬁcation that Fy is linear follows
immediately and the computation showing that
∥F∥=
b

a
dt |y(t)|
is left for the reader.
For a real Hilbert space H it is a non-trivial fact that the dual space H ∗and the
original space H are essentially the same, namely H is self-dual. Before we can

5.4 Dual Spaces
185
establish this result we need to ﬁrst look at linear functionals on inner product spaces
and study perpendicularity in Hilbert spaces, an important and non-trivial issue.
Proposition 5.4 Let V be an inner product space over the ﬁeld K and let y ∈V .
The function Fy : V →K given by Fy(x) = ⟨y, x⟩is a bounded linear functional
with ∥Fy∥= ∥y∥. In particular, Fy ∈V ∗.
Proof The linearity of Fy is immediate from the deﬁnition of an inner product space.
Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, it follows that
|Fy(x)| = |⟨y, x⟩| ≤∥y∥∥x∥
which thus shows that ∥Fy∥≤∥y∥. Considering the case where x = y shows that
∥Fy∥= ∥y∥.
□
A linear functional of the form Fy is said to be representable, with y representing it.
For every inner product space V , we thus obtain a natural candidate for a comparison
between V and its dual V ∗, namely the function φ : V →V ∗given by φ(y) = Fy,
i.e., mapping every element y ∈V to the bounded linear functional it represents.
This function is (easily seen to be) an injection, and so V always embeds in its dual
space. However, φ need not be surjective, i.e., not every bounded linear functional
on V need be representable. In this and in similar situations, a result establishing
conditions under which φ is surjective are thus called representability theorems. The
one we present below, namely that if V is a Hilbert space, then φ is surjective, is one
of many famous representability theorems due to Riesz. We ﬁrst need to establish
some general geometric results in Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 5.15 Any non-empty subset S ⊆H of a Hilbert space H which is closed
and satisﬁes (x + y)/2 ∈S for all x, y ∈S, contains an element of smallest norm.
Proof Consider the real number δ = inf{∥x∥| x ∈S}, which exists since S ̸= ∅. We
need to show that the inﬁmum is attained. There certainly exists a sequence {xk}k≥1
in S with ∥xk∥→δ. It sufﬁces to show that xk →x0 for some x0 ∈H . Indeed,
the continuity of the norm would then imply that ∥x0∥= δ and since S is closed, the
limit point x0 must itself be in S. Since H is complete the convergence of {xk}k≥1
would follow if we can show that the sequence is Cauchy. To that end, recall the
parallelogram law
∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2 = 2∥x∥2 + 2∥y∥2
which holds in any inner product space. Let now x, y ∈S and apply the parallelogram
law to x/2 and y/2, to obtain
1
4∥x −y∥2 = 1
2∥x∥2 + 1
2∥y∥2 −∥x + y
2
∥2.
Since (x + y)/2 ∈S by assumption, it follows that

186
5
Normed Spaces
∥x −y∥2 ≤2∥x∥2 + 2∥y∥2 −4δ2.
Applying this inequality to the elements of the sequence {xk}k≥1 shows that it is
indeed a Cauchy sequence, as required.
□
For the next result recall that in an inner product space V the notation x ⊥y stands
for ⟨x, y⟩= 0, and x ⊥S, for a subset S ⊆V , stands for ⟨x, y⟩= 0 for all y ∈S.
The geometric interpretation of x ⊥y is that x and y are perpendicular.
Theorem 5.16 Let H be a Hilbert space and S ⊂H a proper closed linear
subspace of H . There exists then an element z ̸= 0 such that z ⊥S.
Proof Since S is a proper subset of H , let x ∈H −S. Consider the set
x + S = {x + y | y ∈S}
and notice that it satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 5.15. Thus let z be an element
of minimal norm in the set x + S. Note that x /∈S implies z ̸= 0, and we claim that
z ⊥S. Indeed, let s ∈S be arbitrary, where we may assume ∥s∥= 1. Noting that
z −αs ∈x + S for all α in the ground ﬁeld (either R or C), the minimality of the
norm of z implies that
∥z∥2 ≤∥z −αs∥2 = ⟨z −αs, z −αs⟩= ∥z∥2 + |α|2∥s∥2 −α⟨z, s⟩−α⟨s, z⟩
which simpliﬁes to
0 ≤|α|2 −α⟨z, s⟩−α⟨s, z⟩.
Taking α = ⟨s, z⟩leads to
0 ≤|α|2 −αα −αα = −∥α∥2 = −⟨s, z⟩2
and the result follows.
□
We can now prove the Riesz representation theorem.
Theorem 5.17 (Riesz Representation Theorem For Hilbert Spaces) For a Hilbert
space H over the ﬁeld K the function φ : H →H ∗, given by φ(y) = Fy, where
Fy(x) = ⟨y, x⟩, is an isometric (anti) isomorphism. In more detail:
1. φ is a bijection.
2. φ is norm preserving, i.e., ∥φ(y)∥= ∥y∥for all y ∈H .
3. φ is additive, i.e., φ(y + y′) = φ(y) + φ(y′) for all x, y ∈H .
4. If K = R, then φ(αy) = αφ(y).
5. If K = C, then φ(αy) = αφ(y).

5.4 Dual Spaces
187
Proof The validity of the last three claims is immediate from basic properties of
the inner product. The fact that φ is norm preserving was already established in
Proposition 5.4, and in particular φ is injective. It thus only remains to show that φ is
surjective, in other words that every element in the dual space H ∗is of the form Fy
for some y ∈H (i.e., is representable). This is the only part of the theorem where
the completeness of H plays a role.
Let F ∈H ∗be an arbitrary bounded linear functional on H . If F = 0 the
claim is evident so we may proceed under the assumption that F ̸= 0. Consider
the kernel S = ker(F) = {x ∈H | Fx = 0} = F−1({0}). Then S is a linear
subspace of H , and in fact a proper one by the assumption that F ̸= 0. Further,
since F is continuous, S is also closed (as the inverse image of the closed set {0}).
By Theorem 5.16 there exists a non-zero y ∈H such that y ⊥S. In particular,
F(y) ̸= 0 and let z = y/F(y), and note that F(z) = 1. Now, for all x ∈H
F(x −F(x)z) = F(x) −F(x)F(z) = 0
and thus x −F(x)z ∈S. Since z is perpendicular to S it follows that
0 = ⟨z, x −F(x)z⟩= ⟨z, x⟩−F(x)∥z∥2.
Let h = z/∥z∥2 and then it follows that
F(x) = ⟨h, x⟩,
as required.
□
5.4.2 Duals of Classical Spaces
For a real Hilbert space H the Riesz Representation Theorem establishes that H is
isomorphic to its dual H ∗, and moreover the isomorphism preserves the norm. This
prompts the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.11 A function A : V →W between two normed spaces is a linear
isometry if A is a linear isomorphism which respects the norms in the sense that
∥Ax∥= ∥x∥for all x ∈V . Normed spaces V and W are said to be congruent if
there exists a linear isometry between them.
One can easily verify that a function A : V →W is a linear isometry if, and only
if, it is a linear isomorphism which is also an isometry with respect to the induced
metrics on V and W.
The following theorem establishes classical congruences for the family of ℓp
spaces.
Theorem 5.18 (Riesz) For the claims below all linear spaces are of real sequences,
and thus are linear spaces over the ﬁeld R.

p ∼= ℓq for all 1 < p, q < ∞such that 1/p + 1/q = 1.
Proof
1. Firstly, we construct a function A : c∗
0 →ℓ1, for which we use the standard
unit vectors ek = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . .) ∈c0, with 1 in the k-th position. Notice
that {ek}k≥1 is not a basis for c0. Given a linear functional F ∈c∗
0 let AF be the
sequence (Fe1, Fe2, . . . , Fek, . . .), and denote ak = Fek. Firstly, we claim that
AF ∈ℓ1, so that the codomain of A is indeed ℓ1. To show that AF ∈ℓ1 we need
to establish that
∞

k=1
|ak| < ∞.
For any a ∈R, let σ(a) denote the sign of a, i.e., σ(a) = a/|a| (with σ(0) = 0)
and consider
x(m) = (σ(a1), . . . , σ(am), 0, 0, 0, . . .).
Since |F(x(m))| ≤∥F∥∥x(m)∥= ∥F∥< ∞, and noting that
F(x(m)) =
m

k=1
|ak|,
it follows that
m

k=1
|ak| ≤∥F∥< ∞
and the same inequality remains valid when passing to the limit as m →∞.
Having deﬁned A : c∗
0 →ℓ1, the veriﬁcation that A is linear is immediate, and
thus it remains to show that A is surjective and that ∥AF∥1 = ∥F∥. Indeed, for
surjectivity let a ∈ℓ1, i.e.,
∞

k=1
|ak| < ∞.
If we now deﬁne H : c0 →R by means of the formula
Hx =
∞

k=1
akxk,
then, formally,
Fek = ak
and thus

AH = a.
Thus, it remains to show that Hx is well-deﬁned. Indeed,
∞

k=1
|akxk| ≤sup |xk|
∞

k=1
|ak| ≤∥x∥∞∥a∥1
and so the series deﬁning Hx is absolutely convergent, and thus convergent. The
linearity of H is obvious and the fact that it is bounded follows from the estimate
above. It thus follows that indeed H ∈c∗
0, and, as noted, AH = a, so that A is
surjective. Combining the estimates above it also follows that ∥F∥= ∥AF∥1, so
A is an isometry.
2. The details of the proof are similar to the proof of the ﬁrst claim, so we leave this
proof to the reader.
3. The details are again similar to those given above, but this time some adaptation is
required in the construction, with some complicating consequences in the needed
estimates. Given F ∈ℓ∗
p let AF = (Fe1, . . . , Fek) where {ek}k≥1 are again the
standard unit vectors, and denote again ak = Fek. Considering
x(m) = (|a1|q−1σ(a1), . . . , |am|q−1σ(am), 0, 0, 0 . . .)
we obtain

and thus ∥a∥q ≤∥F∥< ∞. This part of the proof then guarantees that
A : ℓ∗

means of the formula

Remark 5.6 Similar congruences hold true for L p spaces. However, the proofs rely
on non-trivial measure theoretic results, and thus lie beyond the scope of this book.

Normed Spaces
5.4.3 The Hahn-Banach Theorem
The main result we now present is a general result about normed spaces, valid not
only for Banach spaces. We will present some of its consequences that further relate
a space and its dual.
Theorem 5.19 (Hahn-Banach) Let V be a normed space over K, with either K = R
or K = C. Suppose thatU ⊆V a linear subspace, and f : U →K a bounded linear
functional on the subspace U. There exists then a linear functional F : V →K such
that F|U = f and such that ∥F∥= ∥f ∥.
Proof For simplicity, we will only give the proof for real normed spaces. Thus we
assume that a bounded linear functional f : U →R is given. Clearly, if f = 0,
then F = 0 is the desired extension to all of V . We may thus proceed under the
assumption that f ̸= 0, and thus, normalizing if needed, that ∥f ∥= 1. Suppose that
x0 ∈V −U and let U1 be the span of U ∪{x0}. It is easy to see that U1 consists
of all vectors of the form x + βx0, where x ∈U and β ∈R. Notice that, given any
α ∈R, the function
f1(x + βx0) = f (x) + βα
is a linear functional on U1 and it extends U. We will now show that an α ∈R can be
chosen so as to assure that ∥f1∥= 1. By the deﬁnition of the norm ∥f1∥, it sufﬁces
to guarantee that
| f (x) + βα| ≤∥x + βx0∥,
for all x ∈U and β ∈R. Stated differently (replace x by −βx and divide both sides
by |β|), we seek an α such that
| f (x) −α| ≤∥x −x0∥,
for all x ∈U. We thus wish to ﬁnd an α ∈R with
f (x) −∥x −x0∥≤α ≤f (x) + ∥x −x0∥,
for all x ∈U. In other words, α is common to all the intervals [Ax, Bx], for all
x ∈U, where Ax = f (x) −∥x −x0∥and Bx = f (x) + ∥x −x0∥. The existence of
such an α will follow by showing that Ax ≤By for all x, y ∈U. And indeed,
By −Ax = f (y) −f (x) + ∥y −x0∥+ ∥x −x0∥
and since
| f (y) −f (x)| = | f (y −x)| ≤∥y −x∥≤∥y −x0∥+ ∥x −x0∥
it follows that

5.4 Dual Spaces
191
By −Ax ≥0.
We thus established that f , and, importantly, that in fact any linear operator deﬁned
on a proper subspace, can be extended to the span of its current domain with one
additional vector added, without altering the norm.
The stage is now clear for an application of Zorn’s Lemma to further extend f1,
one dimension at a time, until we arrive at a linear operator whose domain is the
entire space V . Let P be the collection of all pairs (U ′, f ′) where U ′ ⊇U is a linear
subspace of V and f ′ : U ′ →R is a linear functional extending f and satisfying
∥f ′∥= 1. Introduce a partial order on P by means of
(U ′, f ′) ≤(U ′′, f ′′)
precisely when U ′ ⊆U ′′ and when f ′′ extends f ′. The fact that P is then a poset,
is immediate. We must now establish the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma. Firstly, P is
non-empty since (U, f ) is a member of P. Next, given a chain {(Ui, fi)}i∈I in P,
consider U ′ = 
i∈I Ui and deﬁne f ′ : U ′ →R as follows. Given u ∈U ′ there
exists an index i ∈I with u ∈Ui. If j ∈I is another index with u ∈U j, then,
since we are given a chain, either fi extends f j or f j extends fi. In either case
setting f ′(u) = fi(u) = f j(u) produces a well-deﬁned function. The function f ′
is a linear functional. Indeed, if u1, u2 ∈U ′, then u1 ∈Ui1 and u2 ∈Ui2 for some
i1, i2 ∈I. But, by the chain condition, we may assume without loss of generality
that Ui1 ⊆Ui2. Thus
f ′(u1 + u2) = fi2(u1 + u2) = fi2(u1) + fi2(u2) = f ′(u1) + f ′(u2)
and thus f ′ is additive. A similar argument shows that f is also homogenous. We
leave it to the reader to similarly show that ∥f ′∥= 1 and thus it is now clear that
(U ′, f ′) is in P and is an upper bound for the given chain. Note however that there
is no guarantee that f ′ is the desired linear functional F, since U ′ may be properly
contained in V .
With the conditions of Zorn’s Lemma now veriﬁed, the existence of a maximal
element (UM, F) ∈P is guaranteed. If UM = V , then F is a linear functional on all
of V , it extends f , and its norm is 1, as required. Assume thus that UM is properly
contained in V , and let x0 ∈V −UM. But, at the beginning of the proof we saw that in
such a situation F can be extended to the linear subspace U!, the span of UM ∪{x0},
without altering the norm. That would give rise to an element (U!, f!) ∈P with
(UM F) < (U!, f!), an impossibility. The proof is thus complete.
□
There are numerous consequence of the Hahn-Banach Theorem, of which we only
explore a few.
Theorem 5.20 Given a normed space V and x0 ∈V with x0 ̸= 0, there exists a
linear functional F ∈V ∗such that ∥F∥= 1 and F(x0) = ∥x0∥.
Proof Let

192
5
Normed Spaces
V0 = {αx0 | α ∈C}
be the subspace of V spanned by x0 and let F0 : V0 →C be given by
F0(αx0) = α∥x0∥.
Clearly, F0 is a linear functional, ∥F0∥= 1, and F0(x0) = ∥x0∥. By the Hahn-Banach
Theorem, an extension F ∈V ∗exists, establishing the claim.
□
Corollary 5.5 For all x ∈V
∥x∥=
sup
F∈V ∗,∥F∥=1
|F(x)|.
Corollary 5.6 For all vectors x in a normed space V , if F(x) = 0 for all F ∈V ∗,
then x = 0.
Theorem 5.21 Let V be normed space and U a linear subspace of it. Given x0 ∈U,
it holds that x0 is in the closure of U if, and only if, there exists no bounded linear
functional f on V with the property that f (x) = 0 for all x ∈U but f (x0) ̸= 0.
Proof Suppose that x0 is in the closure of U. There exists then a sequence {un}n≥1
of element in U converging to x0. Remembering that a bounded linear functional
f : V →K is in particular continuous, it follows that f (un) →f (x0). But then, if
f (x) = 0 for all x ∈U, it follows that f (x0) = 0. In the other direction, suppose x0
is not in the closure of U. Then there exists a positive δ such that ∥x −x0∥> δ, for
all x ∈U. Consider the span U ′ of the set U ∪{x0}. Deﬁne now f1(x + βx0) = β
(remember that the elements of the span are of the form x + βx0, with β ∈K and
x ∈U). This is clearly a linear functional on U1 and since
δ|β| ≤|β|∥x0 + 1
β x∥= ∥βx0 + x∥
we have that ∥f1∥≤1/δ. Since, by deﬁnition, f1(x) = 0 for all x ∈U and
f1(x0) = 1, applying the Hahn-Banach Theorem to extend f ′ to all of V establishes
the claim.

Exercise 5.39 In the previous exercise you constructed explicit extensions of a linear
functional. Convince yourself that for inﬁnite dimensional linear spaces it may be
very hard, if at all possible, to obtain an explicit extension of an arbitrary functional.
Exercise 5.40 Use the Hahn-Banach Theorem to prove that it is possible to assign
to every bounded sequence {xm}m≥1 of real numbers a real number limm→∞xm such
that
1. If {xm} is a convergent sequence, then limm→∞xm is the limit of the sequence in
the usual sense.
2. limm→∞(xm + ym) = limm→∞xm + limm→∞ym for all bounded sequences
{xm}m≥1 and {ym}m≥1.
3. limm→∞αxm = α limm→∞xm for all bounded sequences {xm}m≥1 and all
scalars α ∈R.
Can you determine limm→∞(−1)m?

Normed Spaces
5.5 Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces
Thetheorythatwaspresentedsofarisprimarilyconcernedwiththetheoryofbounded
linear operators between normed spaces. In this section we present two directions for
generalizations of the theory. The ﬁrst one stems from the observation made above
to the effect that while bounded operators encompass a lot of examples of interest,
some important operators, the differentiation operator for instance, are not bounded.
One is thus compelled to consider unbounded operators. The second generalization
we consider originates from the fact that at times the space one is considering does
not support a norm. It turns out that if instead of a norm one has a suitable family of
semi-norms, then one can still recover much of the general theory. Spaces with such
a family of semi-norms are called locally convex spaces, and we will only investigate
the deﬁnition and some illustrative examples, without delving deeper into the general
theory.
5.5.1 Closed Operators
The development of the theory of unbounded linear operators was motivated by the
unbounded nature of the differentiation operator, as well as the development of a
mathematical framework for Quantum Mechanics (e.g., to account for unbounded
observables). Arbitrary unbounded operators may be too wild to tame, and so some
restrictions must be placed in order to identify a suitable class of operators for which
a reasonable theory emerges. The closed operators, presented below, form a class
of operators broader than the bounded ones admitting a strong general theory that
allows one to analyze situations that lie out of the rich of the theory of bounded
operators. The results we present below are only the tip of the unbounded iceberg.
In the context of unbounded linear operators it is common to re-interpret the
deﬁnition of an operator between linear spaces to be one that is not necessarily
deﬁned on all of the speciﬁed domain.
Deﬁnition 5.12 Let B1 and B2 be Banach spaces. An (unbounded) linear opeartor
A : V →W consists of a linear subspace D(A) ⊆V and a function A : D(A) →W
which is additive and homogenous. Further, A is a closed linear operator when the
following condition holds. For every sequence {xm}m≥1 in V if xm →x0 for some
x0 ∈V and Axm →y0 for some y0 ∈W, then x0 ∈D(A) and Ax0 = y0.
Example 5.16 In Example 5.4 we already saw that the differentiation operator d/dt :
C1([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R), with the L∞norm, is an unbounded linear operator.
In the context of unbounded operators we may thus consider
d/dt : C([0, 1], R) →C([0, 1], R),
with the L∞norm, where we may specify various different subspaces as the domain
of deﬁnition. Different choices for the actual domain may lead to completely different

5.5 Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces

properties of the operator. For instance, if we take the domain to be C1([a, b], R),
then we obtain an unbounded closed operator. Indeed, this claim follows from the
elementary results that if {xm}m≥1 is a sequence of functions that converge (point-
wise) to x0, and their derivatives x′
m converge uniformly to y0, then x0 is differentiable
and x′
0 = y0. In contrast, taking the domain of d/dt to be C∞([0, 1], R) yields a
non-closed operator.
The deﬁning condition of a closed operator A : B1 →B2 can be restated in terms
of its graph Γ (A) = {(x, Ax) ∈B1 × B2 | x ∈D(A)}, as follows.
Proposition 5.5 An unbounded linear operator A : B1 →B2 between Banach
spaces is closed if, and only if, the graph Γ (A) is closed in B1 × B2.
The proof is left for the reader. We now prove that a closed linear operator is auto-
matically bounded, provided its domain is closed.
Theorem 5.22 (Banach’s Closed Graph Theorem) Let A : B1 →B2 be a closed
linear operator between Banach spaces. If the domain D(A) is closed in B1, then
A is bounded.
Proof First, it is straightforward to verify that the space B1 × B2 with norm given
by
∥(x, y)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥
is a Banach space. Since A is closed, its graph Γ (A) ⊆B1 × B2 is thus a closed
subsetofacompletespace,andthusisitselfaBanachspace.Similarly,byassumption,
D(A) is closed in B1 and thus is a Banach space too.
We now consider the operator P : Γ (A) →D(A) given by
P(x, Ax) = x,
clearly a linear operator. Since
∥P(x, Ax)∥= ∥x∥≤∥x∥+ ∥Ax∥= ∥(x, Ax)∥
we see that P is a bounded linear operator. Moreover, P is invertible (its inverse P−1
obviously given by x →(x, Ax)) and thus, by Corollary 5.2, P−1 is bounded, say
by M. Therefore,
∥P−1x∥= ∥x∥+ ∥Ax∥≤M∥x∥
for all x ∈D(A), and thus
∥Ax∥≤(M −1)∥x∥
showing A is bounded.
□
We note that this is yet another deep result in the theory of Banach spaces, seeing
that this rather short proof uses a corollary of the Open Mapping Theorem.

Normed Spaces
5.5.2 Locally Convex Spaces
As motivation for the concept we now present, consider the set R∞of all sequences
of real numbers (with obvious modiﬁcations one may also consider C∞). Of course
the linear structure of R carries over to R∞by point-wise operations and thus R∞
is a linear space. However, there is no natural way to turn R∞into a normed space.
In particular, each ℓp norm is only deﬁned on a proper subset of R∞and can not be
extended to a norm on R∞. There is however a natural choice of a family of semi-
norms, deﬁned as follows. For each k ∈N let pk : V →R be given by pk(x) = |xk|,
the absolute value of the k-th component of x. It is easily seen that pk is indeed a
semi-norm.
We thus see that in the absence of a norm a space may still admit a family of
semi-norms and it is the case that, under suitable conditions, signiﬁcant portions of
the theory developed above (in particular the Hahn-Banach Theorem) have suitable
analogues in locally convex spaces. We will now present the deﬁnition and explore
some of the most basic aspects of these spaces.
Deﬁnition 5.13 A locally convex linear space is a linear space V together with a
family {pi}i∈I of semi-norms on V . The family of semi-norms is said to separate
points if from pi(x) = 0 for all i ∈I it follows that x = 0.
Example 5.17 Of course any normed space and any semi-normed space is a locally
convex space. It is not hard to show that any locally convex space given by a ﬁnite
family of semi-norms is in fact semi-normed. Thus the concept of locally convex
spaces becomes substantial only when once considered inﬁnite families of semi-
norms, as in the case of R∞above.
We now consider the topology induced by the family of semi-norms in a locally
convex space.
Deﬁnition 5.14 Let V be a locally convex space given by the family {pi}i∈I of
semi-norms. For each i ∈I and y ∈V let fi,y : V →R be the function
fi,y(x) = pi(x −y).
The induced topology on V is the smallest topology such that each of fi,y : V →R
is continuous.
The existence of such a smallest topology is guaranteed by Proposition 3.11. In fact,
from the proof of that proposition, a local base at y for the induced topology is given
by the collection UB,ε, where B ⊆{pi}i∈I is a ﬁnite subset of the given family of
semi-norms and ε > 0, and
UB,ε = {x ∈V | pi(x −y) < ε
∀i ∈B}.
The following result now follows easily, and thus the proof is left for the reader.

5.5 Unbounded Operators and Locally Convex Spaces
197
Proposition 5.6 Let V be a locally convex space given by the family {pi}i∈I of
semi-norms.
1. A sequence {xm}m≥1 in V converges to x0 ∈V in the induced topology if, and
only if, pi(xm −x0) →0 for all i ∈I.
2. The induced topology is Hausdorff if, and only if, the family of semi-norms
separates points.
3. The linear space operations are continuous.
With these observations made, the resemblance between the theory of normed
spaces we developed above and the theory of locally convex spaces with separated
points is only starting to become visible. Without a doubt, it is more convenient to
have a single norm and appeal to the rich theory of normed spaces whenever possible.
However, often enough a norm is simply not available. The theory of locally convex
spaces is rich enough so as to justify the somewhat cumbersome management of
a family of semi-norms instead of a single norm. As mentioned above, signiﬁcant
portions of the theory of (semi-)normed spaces transfers quite smoothly to the theory
of locally convex spaces, however we do not explore this any further.
Exercises
Exercise 5.41 Prove that if B1 and B2 are Banach spaces, then so is B1 ×B2 with
norm given by ∥(x, y)∥= ∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
Exercise 5.42 Prove that if A : B1 →B2 is a closed linear operator, then its kernel
Ker(A) is a closed subspace of B1.
Exercise 5.43 Prove that any bounded linear operator is a closed operator.
Exercise 5.44 Prove Proposition 5.5.
Exercise 5.45 Let V be a normed space. We may now consider an induced topology
on it in two ways. Namely, we may view it as a locally convex space where the family
of semi-norms consists of just the given norm on V , and obtain the induced topology,
or we may consider the induced metric d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥and consider its induced
topology. Show that the two topologies coincide.
Exercise 5.46 Prove that every locally convex linear space V deﬁned using a ﬁnite
family {pi}i∈I of semi-norms is semi-normed. In more detail, construct a single
semi-norm on V which induces the same topology as the ﬁnite family of semi-norms
does.
Exercise 5.47 Let V be a locally convex space given by the countable family {pi}i≥1
of semi-norms. Consider the function d : V × V →R given by
d(x, y) =

Normed Spaces
Exercise 5.48 Continuing the previous exercise, show that the topology induced by
the semimetric and by the family of semi-norms coincide. (You will need to deﬁne
the topology induced by a semimetric.)
Exercise 5.49 Consider R with the standard structure of an inner product space and
let V = C(R, R) be the linear space of all continuous functions x : R →R. For
each t ∈R let
pt(x) = |x(t)|.
For each n ∈N let
qn(x) =
max
−n≤t≤n |x(t)|.
For each compact subset C ⊆R let
rC(x) = max
t∈C |x(t)|.
For each of the families {pt}t∈R, {qn}n∈N, and {rC}C⊆R, where C ranges over the
compact subsets of R, decide whether it endows V with the structure of a locally
convex space, whether the family of semi-norms separates points, and compare the
induced topologies.
Exercise 5.50 Prove Proposition 5.6.

Topological Groups
Abstract This short chapter is a brief introduction to the theory of topological
groups, set in the context of Banach space theory. Not assuming any knowledge of
groups, the chapter is entirely self-contained, presenting the deﬁnitions of groups,
homomorphisms, (normal) subgroups, and quotient groups before moving on to the
deﬁnition of topological groups. Some fundamental consequences of the interaction
between algebra and topology are discussed. Introducing uniform spaces, the main
message of the chapter is that the topology of a topological group is nearly metrizable,
in the sense that it is uniformizable.

Banach spaces admit a particularly rich theory since the algebraic structure (i.e., the
norm) induces a particularly nice metric (i.e., a complete one) resulting in a powerful
interaction between algebra and geometry. Quite often, when an algebraic structure
and a topological structure are allowed to interact, the fusion of the two theories
results in a very intricate and interesting new theory. Such a fusion is the focus of
this chapter where we present topological groups.
There are at least two motivating reasons for considering topological groups. The
ﬁrst one is that just as groups model symmetry, so do topological groups model
continuous symmetry. The second reason for studying topological groups is that
quite often a portion of, say, a Banach space may fail to be a Banach space on its
own but it may still retain some of the algebra and the topology of the ambient space
to form a topological group. This is often the case since a group is a much weaker
algebraic structure compared to a linear space, and a topology is much weaker than a
metric (whether or not induced by a norm). Topological groups thus are much more
common-place since one only requires a group structure and a topology, rather than
a full linear space and a metric structure, yet the theory of topological groups still
presents a powerful fusion between algebra and geometry.
Section6.1 introduces groups and group homomorphisms, without assuming any
prior knowledge of groups. The main objects of study, namely topological groups,
are then presented in Sect.6.2. Section6.3 presents topological subgroups and a ﬁrst
encounter with the interesting interaction between algebra and topology, namely that
the closure of a subgroup is a subgroup. The quotient construction for topological

Topological Groups
groups is the topic of Sect.6.4, including a rather detailed account of normal sub-
groups. Finally, Sect.6.5 discusses another, deeper, consequence of the interaction
between algebra and topology, namely the uniformizability of the topology of a
topological group, thus enabling one to import signiﬁcant portions of the uniform
machinery of metric spaces into the realm of topological groups.
6.1 Groups and Homomorphisms
The axioms deﬁning a group are an abstraction of structure present in many familiar
algebraic systems, namely an associative and unital binary operation with respect
to which every element is invertible. The historical development of group theory
is rooted in the study of roots of polynomials, famously with the work of Evariste
Galois and Niels Henrik Abel on ﬁnite groups. There is a distinct difference between
the theory of ﬁnite groups and the theory of inﬁnite groups. In ﬁnite group theory
various counting arguments play an important role in determining the structure of
groups. The recent classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite simple groups, the result of an almost
unfathomable collaboration spanning thousands of articles, is a milestone of ﬁnite
group theory. Inﬁnite groups though can be so wild that a full classiﬁcation of all
groups seems beyond reasonable expectations. Some limitations on size must be
placed, and one way to impose such size constraints is through the introduction of
a topology, and demanding that the group, as a topological space, be compact. The
classiﬁcation of compact Hausdorff topological groups is a much more manageable
project.
With that in mind, we turn now to present groups, but with an eye towards their
common applications in Physics (i.e., as tools for the study of symmetry) and as a
step towards deﬁning topological groups (and thus ﬁnite groups are only glanced at).
Deﬁnition 6.1 A group is a triple (G, ·, e) where G is a set, · is a binary operation
G × G →G, usually denoted by (g, h) →g · h, or even just (g, h) →gh, and
e ∈G is a chosen element, such that the following axioms hold.
1. Associativity, i.e., (g1g2)g3 = g1(g2g3) for all g1, g2, g3 ∈G.
2. The element e is an identity element, i.e., eg = g = ge for all g ∈G.
3. Existence of invereses, i.e., for all g ∈G there exists an element, denoted by
g−1 ∈G and called the inverse of g, satisfying gg−1 = e = g−1g.
If gh = hg holds for all g, h ∈G, then the group is said to be commutative or
abelian. In an abelian group it is customary to write g + h instead of gh, and to
denote e, the neutral element, by 0. The cardinality of G is called the order of the
group.
When there is no danger of confusion it is common to refer to a group G, leaving
the operation · and the identity e implicit.

6.1 Groups and Homomorphisms
201
Proposition 6.1 In a group G
1. the identity is unique, i.e., if e′ ∈G has the property that e′g = g = g′e for all
g ∈G, then e′ = e;
2. inverses are unique, i.e., for every element g ∈G, if h1, h2 ∈G satisfy
gh2 = gh1 = e = h1g = h2g,
then h1 = h2.
Proof The arguments are very similar to those given in the proof of Proposition 2.1,
and thus we leave it to the reader to adapt that proof to the current situation.
□
Remark 6.1 An inspection of the deﬁnition of linear space (Deﬁnition 2.1) reveals
that we have already encountered abelian groups. Indeed, in that deﬁnition there are
three sets of axioms, the ﬁrst of which states, precisely, that (V, +, 0) is an abelian
group for any linear space V . Thus, had we chosen to present groups prior to linear
spaces, we could have deﬁned a linear space as an abelian group together with a scalar
product, satisfying the other two sets of axioms in the deﬁnition of linear space.
Many examples of groups arise as the set of symmetries of an object. For instance,
ﬁxing an equilateral triangle in the plane, its symmetries correspond to the various
ways in which rigid motions of the plane map the triangle onto itself. The set of
all rigid motions that map the triangle to itself (of which there are precisely six:
the identity, three reﬂections, and two rotations) is a group under the operation of
composition. The veriﬁcation is straightforward: the composition of rigid motions
that ﬁx the triangle is again a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle, the identity function
is a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle (and thus serves as the identity element of the
group), and the inverse function of a rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle is again a
rigid motion that ﬁxes the triangle. The resulting group is called the dihedral group
of order 6, one member in the following family of groups.
Theorem 6.1 Let P be a regular n-gon in the plane (i.e., a regular polygon with
n vertices), n ≥2. The set Dn of all rigid motions (i.e., functions of the plane to
itself that preserve lengths and angles) together with the operation of composition
of functions is a group.
Proof The reader is invited to turn the argument for D3 given above into a proof of
the general case.
□
Remark 6.2 The groups {Dn}n≥2 are known as the dihedral groups. It can be shown
that Dn has order 2n. For that reason, the dihedral group Dn is also commonly (and
confusingly) denoted by D2n.
Of course, one may vary the shape being ﬁxed, as well as the degree to which the
mappings preserve the ambient geometry, or change the ambient geometry itself. As
an extreme example, given a set S, the set of all bijections σ : S →S, together with

202

Topological Groups
composition of functions, is easily seen to be a group. This is the group of symmetries
of the set S, clearly essentially determined only by the cardinality of S. This group
is denoted by Sym(S), or, when S = {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, by Sn.
Following the same general idea, the following is an important example in the
theory of topological groups.
Theorem 6.2 For n ≥1 let GLn(R) be the set of all invertible linear operators
A : Rn →Rn. With the operation of composition of functions, GLn(R) is a group.
Proof The straightforward veriﬁcation of the axioms, using established results from
Chap.2, is left for the reader.
□
The group GLn(R) is known as the general linear group. It is the group of linear
symmetries of the linear space Rn. By specifying a basis for Rn one may identify
GLn(R) with the set of all invertible n × n matrices with real entries. The group
GLn(R) is essentially the same as the group of invertible n × n matrices over R with
the operation of matrix multiplication. Other important groups are deﬁned in terms
of certain linear symmetries, or, equivalently, as spaces of matrices satisfying various
conditions. See the solved problems section for this chapter for detailed examples.
As a matter of fact, the claim above is a special case of a much more general
source of groups, as we now show.
Theorem 6.3 Let B be a Banach space. The subset G of B(B) consisting of all
invertible bounded linear operators on B, with the operation of composition of
functions, is a group.
Proof The implicit claim that the composition of invertible bounded linear operators
is again an invertible bounded linear operator follows from the fact that
∥A1A2∥≤∥A1∥∥A2∥
for all operators A1, A2 ∈B(B), as is easily established. Next, clearly, the identity
idB is a member of B(B), and it serves as the identity element of the group. The
fact that composition of functions is associative is trivially veriﬁed. The fact that
the inverse operator of a bounded operator is bounded is Corollay 5.2 of the Open
Mapping Theorem.
□
We now turn to the structure preserving mappings between groups.
Deﬁnition 6.2 A function ψ : G →H between groups is a group homomorphism
(or simply a homomorphism) if
ψ(g1g2) = ψ(g1)ψ(g2)
for all g1, g2 ∈G. If ψ is also bijective, then it is called an isomorphism, and then
the groups G and H are said to be isomorphic, denoted by G ∼= H.

6.1 Groups and Homomorphisms
203
Example 6.1 As said above, in the presence of a basis for Rn, there is a bijection
between GLn(R) and GL(n; R), given by mapping an invertible linear operator to
its representing matrix. In fact, this correspondence is a group isomorphism between
the two groups. The determinant function det : GLn(R) →R, which assigns to a
linear operator A : Rn →Rn its determinant (i.e., the determinant of its representing
matrix in any basis) is a group homomorphism det : GLn(R) →R∗. Here R∗is
the set of non-zero real numbers and the group operation is ordinary multiplication.
When n = 1 the determinant det : GL1(R) →R∗is a group isomorphism.
A group homomorphism is only required to preserve the group operations in the
domain and codomain. It follows immediately though that the rest of the group
structure is also preserved. For the proof it is helpful to note that the existence of
inverses in a group immediately implies the left and right cancelation laws: in a group
G, if gh = gh′, then h = h′, and, similarly, if hg = h′g, then h = h′.
Proposition 6.2 Let ψ : G →H be a group homomorphism. Then ψ(e) = e and
ψ(g−1) = ψ(g)−1, for all g ∈G.
Proof We only establish that ψ(e) = e (notice that the e on the left is the identity in
G while on the right it is the identity in H, and thus they may be different). Notice
that ψ(e)ψ(e) = ψ(ee) = ψ(e) = eψ(e). The cancelation law now implies that
ψ(e) = e. The veriﬁcation that ψ(g−1) = ψ(g)−1 is now trivial.
□
The veriﬁcation of the following properties of homomorphisms and isomorphisms
is very similar to the analogous results established for linear operators, for instance
in Proposition 2.8. We thus omit the details of the proof.
Proposition 6.3 Let G1
ϕ
 G2
ψ
 G3 be group homomorphisms. Then
1. The composition ψ ◦ϕ is a homomorphism.
2. If both ϕ and ψ are isomorphisms, then so is ψ ◦ϕ.
3. If ψ is an isomorphism, then so is ψ−1.
4. The identity function idG : G →G is a group isomorphism.
6.2 Topological Groups and Homomorphism
A topological group is a group together with a topology on it which is required
to be compatible with the group structure, in the sense that the group operations
are to be continuous. Some of the far-reaching consequences resulting from this
fusion between algebra and topology will be explored in the subsequent sections. In
particular, it will be shown that the topology must be sufﬁciently metric-like so as to
render such concepts as uniform continuity and Cauchy sequences meaningful. For
now we focus on the deﬁnition and examples.

Topological Groups
Deﬁnition 6.3 A topological group is a group G together with a topology on the set
G such that the group operation · : G × G →G is continuous (with respect to the
given topology on the codomain and the product topology on the domain), and such
that the function G →G given by g →g−1 is continuous.
Example 6.2 The following examples of topological groups are all subsets of R or C,
and we consider each of them with the subspace topology induced, in each case, by
the metric d(x, y) = |x −y|.
1. The circle S1 = {z ∈C | |z| = 1} with the operation of multiplication.
2. The set R of all real numbers with the operation of addition.
3. The set R∗of all non-zero real numbers with the operation of multiplication.
4. The set C of all complex numbers with the operation of addition.
5. The set C∗of all non-zero complex numbers with the operation of multiplication.
A large family of examples of topological groups are obtained by the following result.
Lemma 6.1 Let V be a normed space. Then (V, +, 0), i.e., the additive structure of
the space, is a topological group.
Proof We already noted that the additive part of a linear space is an abelian group.
The continuity requirements are satisﬁed by Proposition 5.1.
□
Another signiﬁcant source of topological groups arises from groups of bounded linear
operators on a Banach space.
Theorem 6.4 Let B be a Banach space. The subset G of B(B) consisting of the
invertible bounded linear operators on B is a topological group when endowed with
the operator norm topology.
Proof Having already observed that G is a group under composition of functions,
it remains to verify the continuity of the composition and the inverse mapping with
respect to the operator norm. The continuity of the composition follows at once from
the inequality
∥A1A2∥≤∥A1∥∥A2∥
while the continuity of the inverse mapping is the statement of Exercise 5.30.
□
Corollary 6.1 The general linear group GLn(R), when endowed with the operator
norm topology, is a topological group (which is not abelian if n > 1).
Proof GLn(R) is the group of invertible operators on the Banach space Rn.
□
Since a topological group is a fusion between a group and a topological space, so
are homomorphisms of topological groups a fusion between group homomorphisms
and continuous mappings.

6.2 Topological Groups and Homomorphism
205
Deﬁnition 6.4 A function ψ : G →H between topological groups is said to be a
homomorphism if ψ is both continuous and a group homomorphism. We say that ψ
is an isomorphism if ψ is both a group isomorphism and a homeomorphism. If an
isomorphism between topological groups G and H exists, then the groups are said
to be isomorphic, denoted by G ∼= H.
Example 6.3 In a topological group G, the mapping g →g−1 is a homeomorphism
but not usually a group homomorphism. Indeed, it is a group homomorphism if G is
abelian, since then
(gh)−1 = g−1h−1
while in general one only has the equality
(gh)−1 = h−1g−1.
For any ﬁexed element a ∈G, the left translation mapping g →ag and the right
translation mapping g →ga are both homeomorphisms, but are generally not group
homomorphisms. The determinant function det : GLn(R) →R∗is continuous
(since the determinant is polynomial in the entries of the matrix) and, as we have
seen, is a group homomorphism, and thus is a homomorphism of topological groups.
det : GL1(R) →R∗is an isomorphism.
The reader is invited to state and prove the analogous result of Proposition 6.3 for
topological homomorphisms and isomorphisms.
6.3 Topological Subgroups
A topological subgroup of a topological group is a subset which, on its own right, is
a topological group with the induced algebraic and topological structures from the
ambient topological group. In other words, a topological subgroup is a fusion of the
concepts subgroup and topological subspace. Fortunately, it turns out that the sub-
space topology on a subgroup is automatically compatible with the group structure,
and thus it is only the algebraic structure that dictates what the topological sub-
groups are. Consequently, there is no difference between the topological subgroups
of a topological group and its subgroups when the topology is forgotten.
In light of the above, we focus on the notion of subgroup, and, anticipating the
contents of the next section, already discuss normal subgroups. We then observe
the ﬁrst non-trivial consequence of the interaction of the algebra and the topology,
namely that the closure of a subgroup is a subgroup.
Deﬁnition 6.5 A subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G if the group operation in
G restricts to a group operation on H. Equivalently, H is a subgroup of G if e ∈H
and for all h1, h2 ∈H

∈H.
The motivation for the following deﬁnition is presented in the next section.
Deﬁnition 6.6 A subgroup H of a group G is said to be normal if ghg−1 ∈H for
all h ∈H and g ∈G. The element ghg−1 is called the conjugate of h by g. Thus, a
subgroup is normal when it is closed under conjugation.
Remark 6.3 Note that the condition for normality of H in G is equivalent to: for all
g ∈G and h ∈H, there exists h′ ∈G such that
hg = gh′.
Thus, the condition of normality can be seen as a weak form of commutativity;
elements in G commute with elements in H, up to a replacement by another element
in H. In particular, if G is abelian, then every subgroup H of G is normal.
Example 6.4 Given a group homomorphism ψ : G →H, its kernel is the set
Ker(ψ) = {g ∈G | ψ(g) = e}. The kernel of a homomorphism is easily seen
to always be a normal subgroup of G. One may also easily verify (compare with
Theorem 2.8) that Ker(ψ) = {e}, i.e., the kernel is the trivial subgroup of G, if, and
only if, ψ is injective.
Regarding subgroups of a topological group G, the presence of a topology entails
no complications, at least in the following sense.
Lemma 6.2 Let G be a topological group and H a subgroup of G. When endowed
with the subspace topology, H is a topological group.
The proof is immediate, relying on the simple fact that the restriction of a continuous
mapping to a subspace remains continuous.
We may now demonstrate one consequence of the fruitful interaction between the
group structure and the topology.
Theorem 6.5 If H is a (normal) subgroup of a topological group G, then H, the
closure of H, is also a (normal) subgroup of G.
Proof Toshowthat H isasubgroup,weneedtoshowthat gh−1 ∈H forall g, h ∈H.
In other words, for the function f : G × G →G given by f (g, h) = gh−1, we need
to establish that f (H × H) ⊆H. Since f is clearly continuous, and H is closed,
it follows that f −1(H) is closed. Next, H × H ⊆f −1(H) ⊆f −1(H), where the
ﬁrst inclusion follows from the fact that H is a subgroup and the second inclusion
since H ⊆H. Taking closures leads to H × H ⊆f −1(H) = f −1(H). The result
follows by noting that H × H = H × H (this latter fact is a general property of
closures that has nothing to do with the group structure on H). We leave it to the
reader to verify that if H is a normal subgroup, then so is H.

6.4 Quotient Groups

6.4 Quotient Groups
Whereas the notion of subgroup of a topological group was quite straightforward,
with a seamless interaction between the algebraic and the topological demands, the
situation for the quotient of a topological group by a subgroup is more intricate. The
main difﬁculty lies with the algebraic structure, namely that for an arbitrary subgroup
H, it is not always possible to obtain a group structure on the relevant quotient set.
Topologically however, there are no difﬁculties since the quotient topology is always
available. The details are given below.
Given a group G and a subgroup H, deﬁning g1 ∼g2 precisely when g−1
1 g2 ∈H
is easily seen to be an equivalence relation on G. The equivalence class of g ∈G is
easily seen to be the set
gH = {gh | h ∈H}
and is called the left coset of g. In particular, two left cosets g1H and g2H are equal
if, and only if, g−1
1 g2 ∈H. Similarly, deﬁning g1 ∼g2 precisely when g1g−1
2
∈H
gives rise to an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are all of the form
Hg = {hg | h ∈H}
and are called right cosets (of H in G). Of course, if G is abelian, then the left and
right cosets coincide, but in general they may be different. However, any general
result concerning left cosets in a group has a corresponding dual result about right
cosets. In fact the translation between results on left and right cosets is achieved by
means of the correspondence gH ↔Hg−1. For this reason, we may safely only
concentrate on either left or right cosets, and we choose the left ones.
Thus, any choice of a subgroup H of G gives rise to an equivalence relation ∼
with corresponding quotient set
G/H = {gH | g ∈G},
the set of all left cosets of H in G, with the corresponding canonical projection
π : G →G/H given by π(g) = gH. We now address the question whether the
group structure on G induces a group structure on G/H.
Theorem 6.6 Let H be a subgroup of a group G. If the operation on G/H given by
(g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H is well-deﬁned, then it deﬁnes a group structure on G/H
and π : G →G/H is a group homomorphism.
Proof The veriﬁcation of the group axioms is trivial. For instance, noticing that the
coset eH is precisely the set H, we show that H is an identity element for the given
operation. Let gH ∈G/H be an arbitrary element. Then
H · gH = eH · gH = (e · g)H = gH

208
6
Topological Groups
and similarly gH · H = gH. We leave the veriﬁcation of the other group axioms to
the reader. The claim that π is a group homomorphism is nothing but the observation
that π(g1g2) = (g1g2)H = g1H · g2H = π(g1)π(g2).
□
We thus see that as soon as the operation (g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H is well-deﬁned,
the quotient set G/H acquires a group structure. For the operation to be well-deﬁned,
one needs to verify that if g1H = g3H and g2H = g4H, then necessarily g1g2H =
g3g4H. In other words, given that g−1
1 g3 ∈H and that g−1
2 g4 ∈H, it must follow
that (g1g2)−1g3g4 ∈H. Let us denote g−1
1 g3 = h1 and g−1
2 g4 = h2. Noting that
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 g−1
1 g3g4 = g−1
2 h1g4,
if G were abelian, then we would obtain that
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 g4h1 = h2h1 ∈H,
as desired. However, G need not be abelian. A closer look though reveals that a
commutativity demand is far too strong. Indeed, if H is a normal subgroup of G,
then for g4 and h1 as above, there exists h′ ∈H such that h1g4 = g4h′, and then
(g1g2)−1g3g4 = g−1
2 h1g4 = g−1
2 g4h′ = h1h′ ∈H.
We summarize this discussion as follows, remarking ﬁrst that for a normal subgroup
H in G, it follows at once that the left and right cosets of H in G coincide, and thus
one may simply speak of the cosets of H in G.
Theorem 6.7 If H is a normal subgroup of G, then the quotient set G/H of all
cosets of H in G is a group when endowed with the operation
(g1H) · (g2H) = (g1g2)H.
The canonical projection π : G →G/H is then a group homomorphism. The group
G/H is called the quotient group of G by H.
Corollary 6.2 A subgroup H of a group G is normal if, and only if, H is the kernel
of some group homomorphism whose domain is G.
Proof It was already noted that the veriﬁcation that the kernel of a homomorphism
is a normal subgroup is straightforward. For the converse, show that
Ker(π) = H
for the canonical projection π : G →G/H.
□
The situation now for a topological group G and a subgroup H of it is summarized
in the following result whose proof is left for the reader.

6.4 Quotient Groups
209
Theorem 6.8 Let G be a topological group and H a subgroup.
1. The set {gH | g ∈G} of all left cosets of H in G is the quotient set for the
equivalence relation g1 ∼g2
⇐⇒
g−1
1 g2 ∈H. When endowed with the
quotient topology it is a topological space but it need not be a group.
2. The set {Hg | g ∈G} of all right cosets of H in G is the quotient set for the
equivalence relation g1 ∼g2
⇐⇒
g1g−1
2
∈H. When endowed with the
quotient topology it is a topological space but it need not be a group.
3. If H is normal in G, then left and right cosets coincide, as do the two quotient
sets above, which are then denoted by G/H. The quotient set G/H acquires a
group structure from G and with the quotient topology it is a topological group.
6.5 Uniformities
In the presence of a topology notions such as convergence and continuity become
available. However, a topology is too weak to speak of Cauchy sequences (and thus
of completeness) or of uniform continuity, notions that do exist in the presence of a
metric. However, there exists a structure, known as a uniformity, which is in between
a topology and a metric, and which does allow one to speak of Cauchy sequences,
completeness, completions, and uniform continuity. Moreover, every topological
group is automatically endowed with two (often distinct) such uniformities, as we
show below.
We ﬁrst deﬁne the concept of uniformity in general and then proceed to describe
the canonical uniformities present in any topological group. As motivation, recall
that the axiomatization of a topology can be seen as the result of purifying a distance
function, eliminating any trace of details irrelevant for continuity. Similarly, the
axiomatization of a uniformity can be seen to arise from a similar puriﬁcation of a
distance function from anything irrelevant to uniform continuity.
Deﬁnition 6.7 Let X be a set. A non-empty collection E = {Ei}i∈I of relations
Ei ⊆X × X is said to be a uniform structure or a uniformity on X if the following
conditions hold (where we write x ∼E y to indicate that (x, y) ∈E).
1. x ∼E x for all E ∈E and x ∈X.
2. For all E ∈E there exists an F ∈E such that x ∼F y implies y ∼E x.
3. For all E ∈E there exists an F ∈E such that x ∼F y and y ∼F z together
imply that x ∼E y.
4. If E, F ∈E , then so is E ∩F.
5. If E ⊆F ⊆X × X and E ∈E , then F ∈E .
The pair (X, E ) is then called a uniform space. The members of E are knows as
entourages. If context clariﬁes any ambiguity, it is common to refer to a uniform
space X, leaving the collection E of entourages implicit.

210
6
Topological Groups
Example 6.5 Given a metric space (X, d), a uniformity on the set X is induced by
the distance function as follows. For every ε > 0 consider the set
Eε = {(x, y) ∈X × X | d(x, y) < ε}.
It then follows that the collection
E = {E ⊆X × X | ∃ε > 0 E ⊇Eε}
is a uniformity. The veriﬁcation of the axioms is straightforward. For instance, con-
dition 3 follows from the triangle inequality: given E ⊇Eε, let F = Eε/2, then
if x ∼F y and y ∼F z, namely d(x, y), d(y, z) < ε/2, then d(x, z) < ε, so that
x ∼E z. The resulting uniformity is called the induced uniformity.
Deﬁnition 6.8 A function f : X →Y between uniform spaces is said to be uni-
formly continuous if f −1(E) is an entourage in X for every entourage E in Y (here
f −1(E) stands for {(x, x′) ∈X × X | f (x) ∼E f (x′)}).
Recall that a topology captures the notion of continuity in the sense that a function
f : X →Y between metric spaces is continuous in the metric sense if, and only if, f
is continuous with respect to the induced topologies. We now establish the analogous
result for uniformities and uniformly continuous functions.
Theorem 6.9 A function f : X →Y between metric spaces is uniformly continuous
inthemetricsenseif,andonlyif, f isuniformlycontinuouswithrespecttotheinduced
uniformities.
Proof Suppose that f is uniformly continuous in the sense that for every entourage
F in Y, f −1(F) is an entourage in X. Given ε > 0 consider the entourage
Fε = {(y, y′) ∈Y × Y | d(y, y′) < ε}.
By deﬁnition of the induced uniformity, f −1(Fε) contains an entourage of the form
Eδ = {(x, x′) ∈X ×X | d(x, x′) < δ}, for some δ > 0. In particular, if d(x, x′) < δ,
then (x, x′) ∈Eδ and thus ( f (x), f (x′)) ∈Fε, namely d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε. In other
words, f is uniformly continuous with respect to the metrics.
In the other direction, suppose that f is uniformly continuous in the sense that
for all ε > 0 there exists a corresponding δ > 0 such that d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε
provided that d(x, x′) < δ. To show that f is uniformly continuous with respect to
the induced uniformities, let F be an entourage in Y, namely there exists an ε > 0
such that F ⊇Fε where
Fε = {(y, y′) ∈Y × Y | d(y, y′) < ε}.
With δ > 0 corresponding to ε, we claim that f −1(F) ⊇Eδ, where
Eδ = {(x, x′) ∈X × X | d(x, x′) < δ}.

6.5 Uniformities
211
Indeed, if (x, x′) ∈Eδ, then d(x, x′) < δ and thus d( f (x), f (x′)) < ε. It follows
that (x, x′) ∈f −1(Fε), and thus Eδ ⊆f −1(Fε) ⊆f −1(F), This shows that f −1(E)
contains an entourage in X, and thus is itself an entourage, which is what we needed
to show.
□
Clearly, the distance function can not be reconstructed from the induced uniformity.
It is a simple matter to ﬁnd different metrics that induce the same uniformity (for
instance, by scaling all distances by a positive constant). A uniform space (X, E )
whose uniform structure E is the induced uniformity for some distance function
d on X is said to be a metrizable uniform space. Thus, so far, we established that
the concept uniform space is weaker than that of metric space, and that it correctly
captures the notion of uniformly continuous functions. Next, we show that every
uniform space induces a topology.
Theorem 6.10 Let (X, E ) be a uniform space. The collection τ of sets U ⊆X such
that for all x ∈U there exists an entourage E ∈E such that {y ∈X | x ∼E y} ⊆U
is a topology on U, called the induced topology.
Proof The proof is left as an exercise for the reader.
□
The passage from a distance function to the induced uniformity loses information
and is thus not a reversible process. Similarly the passage from a uniformity to the
induced topology is not reversible. A topological space (X, τ) whose topology τ is
the induced topology for some uniformity on X is called a uniformizable topological
space.
We are now ready to describe the two uniformities present on any topological
group. Recall that every element a ∈G gives rise to the left translation map g →ag
and to the right translation map g →ga, both of which are homeomorphisms. We
extend the translation mappings so that they also operate on subsets S ⊆G, that is
we deﬁne aS = {as | s ∈S}, and similarly Sa = {sa | s ∈S}.
Theorem 6.11 Let G be a topological group and B a local basis at e. For every
open set U ∈B let RU = {(x, y) ∈X × X | xy−1 ∈U}. The collection
ER = {E ⊆X × X | ∃U ∈B
E ⊇RU}
is a uniformity on X called the induced right uniformity. Similarly, for each U ∈B
let LU = {(x, y) ∈X × X | x−1y ∈U}. The collection
EL = {E ⊆X × X | ∃U ∈B
E ⊇LU}
is a uniformity on X called the induced left uniformity.
Proof This is a routine veriﬁcation of the axioms of a uniform space.
□
The following properties of the induced uniformities justify the names given to them.
Theorem 6.12 Let G be a topological group and let EL and ER be the left and right
induced uniformities. Then

212
6
Topological Groups
1. The induced topology by either EL or ER is the original topology on G.
2. Every left translation g →ag is uniformly continuous with respect to EL.
3. Every right translation g →ga is uniformly continuous with respect to ER.
Proof The proof is straightforward.
□
Remark 6.4 We conclude the book with the following remark. A sequence {xm}m≥1
in a uniform space X is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for every entourage E there
exists an N ∈N such that xk ∼E xn for all k, n > N. A uniform space X is said to
be complete if every Cauchy sequence in X converges (under the topology induced
by the uniformity). The process of completion of a metric space (as given in Chap.4
by means of Cauchy sequences) extends to a completion process for every uniform
space (however not by means of Cauchy sequences, as they are too weak for general
uniform spaces). Similarly, other uniform concepts of metric spaces have analogous
results valid for all uniform spaces.
The result above shows that the topology of a topological group is always uni-
formizable (and the uniformity can be chosen to further be compatible with all right
or all left translations). Thus, in a sense, the topology of topological groups is rather
tame, behaving more like metric spaces do than the more wild topological spaces
out there do.

7.2 Topological Spaces
7.11 (Separation properties) A topological space X is said to satisfy:
• the T0 separation axiom if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exists an open set
U such that either x ∈U and y ̸∈U, or y ∈U and x ̸∈U;
• the T1 separation axiom if for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist two open sets
U and V such that x ∈U and y ̸∈U, and y ∈V and x ̸∈V ;
• the T2 separation axiom if X satisﬁes the Hausdorff separations property, that is
for all distinct points x, y ∈X there exist two open sets U and V such that x ∈U,
y ∈V , and U ∩V = ∅.
Clearly, the separation properties are increasing in strength. For every separation

7.6.1 Linear Spaces
7.1 Suppose that
αx + βy + γ z = 0
for some scalars α, β, γ ∈R. The equation is a functional equality, and thus for any
choice of t ∈R we have that
αx(t) + βy(t) + γ z(t) = 0.
However, by considering the values t = 0, t = π/2, t = π, we obtain the equations:
β + γ = 0, α + γ = 0, and −β + γ = 0, from which α = β = γ = 0 follows
easily. Thus the only linear combination resulting in the constantly zero function is
the trivial combination, showing the desired linear independence. Now, as for x2,
y2, and z2, noting that x2(t) + y2(t) = 1 = z2(t), we see that x2 + y2 −z2 = 0,
establishing the desired linear dependence.
7.2 Given a set S of vectors in V , suppose ﬁrst that S is linearly independent. We
must show that every ﬁnite subset of it is linearly independent, thus let S f ⊆S be a
ﬁnite subset of S. Suppose that
0 =
m

k=1
αkxk,
where α1, . . . , αm are scalars and x1, . . . , xm ∈S f . But then the exact same linear
combination is also a linear combination of elements from the linearly independent
set S, and thus all scalars must be 0. This shows S f is linearly independent. In the
other direction, suppose every ﬁnite subset of S is linearly independent. To show
that S is linearly independent suppose that 0 is obtained as a linear combination

(necessarily a ﬁnite one!) as above, with x1 . . . , xm ∈S. Consider then the ﬁnite set
{x1, . . . , xm} ⊆S
and we thus see that 0 is written as a linear combination of elements from that subset,
which is linearly independent by assumption. Thus all scalars must be 0, and thus S
is linearly independent.
7.3 Consider R as a linear space over itself and let W be a non-trivial linear subspace
of R. Thus W contains some non-zero vector, namely a real number x ̸= 0. The
dimension of R over itself is clearly 1, and thus any non-zero vector spans all of R.
Since W, as a linear subspace, is its own span, we conclude that W = R. Thus, we
showed that other than the trivial subspace {0}, the only other subspace of R is R
itself, as required.
Now we consider R as a linear space over Q, and note that this is an inﬁnite
dimensional linear space. Let B be a Hamel basis for R over Q. For every subset X
of B consider the span of X, and denote it by WX. We claim that WX ̸= WY for all
subsets X, Y ⊆B with X ̸= Y. Indeed, seeking a contradiction, suppose WX = WY
and we may assume that X is not a subset of Y. Choose a vector x ∈X −Y. Since
x ∈WX it follows that x ∈WY . Thus

is a non-trivial linear combination of vectors from the linearly independent set B,
an impossibility. To conclude then, for each subset of B we obtained a unique linear
subspace of R. There are thus inﬁnitely many subspaces, as required. In fact, the
cardinality of a Hamel basis in this case was shown to be equal to |R|, the cardinality
of the real numbers. We thus showed that R as a linear space over Q has at least
|P(B)| many linear subspaces, a cardinality known to be strictly larger than the
cardinality of B, and thus of R.

y =

αx · x
as a (ﬁnite!) linear combination of vectors from X. If
F(y) =

αx · f (x)
is well-deﬁned, then it clearly gives rise to the desired linear extension of f . So,
suppose that
y =

βx · x
is another expression of y as a linear combination of vectors from X. But then, by
subtracting the two expressions, we obtain
0 =

(αx −βx) · x
which is a linear relation in X. It thus follows that
0 =

(αx −βx) · f (x)
from which it follows that the formula for computing F(y) is independent of the
presentation of y as a linear combination of vectors from X, as desired.
As for the special case where X = B is a basis, note that the span of X is then
the entire ambient space V , and that the linear independence of B implies that there
are no linear relations in X, so the needed condition for the extension is vacuously
satisﬁed.

As for the existence of a linear space U which contains an isomorphic copy of
every linear space over R, the fact that no such linear space exists is a consequence
of a set-theoretic result known as Cantor’s Theorem. Suppose that such a U does
exist. By constructing free linear spaces one sees that linear spaces of arbitrarily
large cardinality exist. That is, given any set X, no matter how large, there always
exists a linear space having X as a basis. Since U is assumed to contain a copy of
every linear space, it follows that X is in bijection with a subset of U. In other words,
there exists an injection X →U, and thus |X| ≤|U|, for all sets X.
In particular, for the set X = P(U) of all subsets of U one has that
|P(U)| ≤|U|.
However, the function u →{u} is clearly an injection U →P(U), and thus
|U| ≤|P(U)|.
We thus conclude, by the Cantor-Shröder-Bernstein Theorem (see Preliminaries if
needed), that
|U| = |P(U)|.
However, this is known to be impossible by an argument we now present.
Theorem 7.1 (Cantor’s Theorem) For all sets S there exists no surjective function
S →P(S). In particular |S| < |P(S)|.

7.6 Solutions
227
Proof Suppose a surjective function f : S →P(S) exists. Consider then the set
S! = {s ∈S | s /∈f (s)}
which is clearly a subset of S, and thus S! ∈P(S). Since f is surjective, it follows
that there exists s! ∈S with f (s!) = S!. To obtain a contradiction let us consider
whether s! ∈S! or not. If s! ∈S!, then s! /∈f (s!) = S!, which is absurd. However,
if s! /∈S! = f (s!), then s! fulﬁlls the condition for being an element in S!, and thus
s! ∈S!, again an absurdity. We must conclude that no such f exists.
Since no surjection from S to P(S) exists, no bijection exists either, and thus the
sets have different cardinalities. Since s →{s} is clearly an injection S →P(S) it
follows that |S| < |P(S)|.

7.7 Let Eab be the 3 × 3 matrix whose entries are all 0 except for the (a, b) entry
being 1. Clearly, the set {Eab}a,b∈{1,2,3} spans M. We have to ﬁnd a basis composed
of rank 2 matrices. For a, b, c, d ∈{1, 2, 3}, deﬁne
Fa,b;c,d = Eab + Ecd
and
Ga,b;c,d = Eab −Ecd.
Note that, if a ̸= c and b ̸= d, then Fa,b;c,d and Ga,b;c,d have rank 2. Note also that
Eab = 1
2 Fa,b;c,d + 1
2Ga,b;c,d,
where we can choose a ̸= c and b ̸= d. The reader can now easily identify a set of
rank 2 matrices that span M.
7.8 We prove that dim(Pn) = n + 1 by showing that
{1, x, x2, . . . , xn}
is a basis. Clearly these vectors span Pn and the fact that they are linearly independent
follows easily from the more general argument given next, where the dimension of
P is computed.
We show that the dimension of P is countably inﬁnite by showing that
{1, x, x2, . . . , xn, . . .}
is a basis. It is obvious that these vectors span P. To see that they are linearly
independent suppose that a linear combination of the vectors results in the zero
vector. In other words, 0 = n
k=0 αkxk for some real numbers α0, . . . , αn. But this
linear combination is a polynomial and it is well-known that the only polynomial
that evaluates to 0 on all real numbers is the 0 polynomial. Thus all coefﬁcients must
be equal to 0, and therefore the only linear combination resulting in the zero vector
is the trivial linear combination.

7.9 We note ﬁrst the general fact that if A : U →V and B : V →W are invertible
functions, then (B ◦A)−1 = A−1 ◦B−1. This is nothing but the computation
B(A(A−1(B−1(w)))) = B(B−1(w)) = w
and similarly
A−1(B−1(B(A(u)))) = A−1(A(u)) = u
for all w ∈W and all u ∈U. Now, going back to the linear operators A and B,
assumed to commute, we have
A−1B−1 = (B A)−1 = (AB)−1 = B−1A−1,
as required.
7.10 Assume ﬁrst that V is inﬁnite dimensional, and let B be an inﬁnite basis of V .
Fix a vector x0 ∈B and consider the set S = B −{x0}. As a subset of a basis these
vectors are linearly independent, and thus S is a basis of the subspace spanned by
S. Clearly, x0 is missing from that span (otherwise the original B would be linearly
dependent, which is impossible since it is a basis), and thus S is a proper subspace of
V . To show that S ∼= V it sufﬁces to show they have equal dimensions, namely that
|B| = |S|. Clearly, |S| ≤|B|, since the inclusion S →B is an injection. If we can
construct an injection in the other direction as well, then, using the Cantor-Shröder-
Bernstein Theorem, the cardinalities will indeed be shown to be equal. To construct
an injection f : B →S, let {xm}m≥1 be a countably inﬁnite list of distinct vectors
in S. Deﬁne now f (xm) = xm+1 for all m ≥1, with f (x0) = x1, and f (x) = x in
all other cases. It is immediate to verify that f is indeed an injection. This completes
the proof that if V is inﬁnite dimensional, then it is isomorphic to a proper subspace
of it.
In the other direction, suppose that V ∼= U for some proper subspace U. Since
linear spaces over the same ﬁeld are isomorphic if, and only if, their dimensions
are equal, it follows that dim(V ) = dim(U). But in a ﬁnite dimensional space, if a
subspace has the same dimension as the ambient space, then the subspace coincides
with the ambient space, and is thus not proper. We conclude that V must be inﬁnite
dimensional.
7.6.2 Topological Spaces
Remark 7.1 In topology the term neighborhood of a point x in a topological space
X may mean one of two things. Either an open set U in X with x ∈U, or an arbitrary
subset N ⊆X which contains an open set U with x ∈U. The difference is only
cosmetic, and one can easily translate between the two situations. In the solutions
below we adhere to the ﬁrst meaning of neighborhood.

7.11 Any indiscrete space with more than one element very clearly does not satisfy
the T0 property. For an example of a space that is T0 but not T1 consider the Sierpinski
space S = {0, 1}. For a T1 space that is not T2, let S be an inﬁnite set endowed with the
coﬁnite topology. Clearly the T1 separation property is satisﬁed since given distinct
points x, y ∈S, the sets S −{x} and S −{y} are open and clearly satisfy the
requirements. We show that S is not T2. Indeed, let x, y be two distinct points in S
and suppose x ∈U and y∈V for some open sets U, V . Then the complements of U
and of V are ﬁnite subsets of S, and thus
S −(U ∩V ) = (S −U) ∪(S −V )
is also ﬁnite. Since S is inﬁnite it follows that U ∩V ̸= ∅.
7.12 A locally (path) connected space that is not (path) connected is, for instance,
the space (0, 1) ∪(3, 4) as a subspace of R with the Euclidean topology (as is easy
to see). As for the comb space, we ﬁrst show that it is path connected, and thus also
connected. Indeed, any point admits a path to the point (0, 0) by ﬁrst traveling south
to meet the X-axis and then traveling west. Thus any two points can be joined by a
path in the space, so it is indeed path-connected. It is however not locally connected,
and thus not locally path-connected. Indeed, given any point of the form p = (0, y)
with 0 < y < 1, consider a small enough circle centered at p which does not intersect
the X-axis. Any open set containing p must contain a subset of this form, but such
a set is not connected.
7.13 Let X be a compact space. Given any x ∈X we may take U = C = X, and
then x ∈U ⊆C with U open and C compact, so X is locally compact. An example
of a locally compact space that is not compact is, e.g., R with the Euclidean topology.
Its non-compactness is obvious. As for it being locally compact, suppose x ∈R is
given. Then x ∈(x −1, x + 1) ⊆[x −1, x + 1], as required.
As an example of a space that is not locally compact, consider Q as a subspace
of R with the Euclidean topology. We will show that Q is not locally compact at any
point. This will be done by showing that in fact no non-empty compact subset of Q
contains a non-empty open set. To see that, suppose that U ⊆C where U is open
and C is compact, and both are non-empty. It follows that Q ∩(a, b) ⊆U for some
non-empty open interval (a, b). Since Q is Hausdorff, the compact set C is closed,
and thus, taking closures, we obtain that [a, b] ∩Q ⊆C. This is thus a closed subset
of a compact set in a Hausdorff space, and thus Q ∩[a, b] is compact. But that is
not the case. Indeed, let y ∈[a, b] be an irrational number and let {qn}n ∈N be a
strictly increasing sequence of rationals tending to y. Let Un = Q ∩(−∞, qn) and
consider also the set Q ∩(y, ∞). These are open sets in the subspace topology that
cover [a, b] but (as the reader may easily verify) they admit no ﬁnite subcovering.

In particular, by means of the homeomorphism Φ : M2(R) →R4, the set X can be
identiﬁed with the set
S = {u = (a, b, c, d) ∈R4 | ψ1(u) = ψ2(u) = ψ3(u) = ψ4(u) = 0},
where
ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4 : R4 →R
are the functions
ψ1(x, y, z, w) = x2 + yz,
ψ2(x, y, z, w) = xy + yw,
ψ3(x, y, z, w) = yz + z2,
ψ4(x, y, z, w) = xz + zw.
In other words,
S = ψ−1
1 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
2 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
3 ({0}) ∩ψ−1
4 ({0})
and since each ψi is a polynomial function, and thus continuous, the set φ−1
i
({0}) is
closed (since {0} is closed in R). We see that S is the intersection of four closed sets,
and hence it is itself closed.

Un = X.
But there is no ﬁnite sub-family of {Un}n∈Z that still covers X. Indeed, for any m ∈Z,

Finally, we show that X is connected. In fact, we prove that X is path-connected.

hence the eigenvalues are a = 0 and c = 0. In particular, the eigenvalues belong to

1. We prove that ˜X is T1 and hence also T0. We have to prove that, for any pair
of distinct points p, q ∈˜X, there exists a neighborhood Up of p not containing
q and a neighborhood Uq of q not containing p. Consider ﬁrst the following
case. Suppose that the points are p = [(x, 1)] = [(x, 2)] with x ∈R −{0}

are open neighborhoods of p, respec-

the case p = [(0, 1)] and q = [(0, 2)]. In this case, we consider the sets

clearly neighborhoods of p, respectively q, and p ̸∈Uq and q ̸∈Up. The space
˜X is thus T1.
We prove next that ˜X is not T2. Consider the points p = [(0, 1)] , q = [(0, 2)] for
which we prove that no disjoint neighborhoods exist. Indeed, any neighborhood

open set

provides an open covering of ˜X. But,
for any m ∈Z, the point [(m, y)] ∈˜X, for y ∈{1, 2}, belongs to just one of the
elements of the family U . Hence there exists no ﬁnite sub-family of U covering
˜X. This proves that ˜X is not compact.
3. We prove that ˜X is path-connected. Indeed, consider a point [(x, y)] ∈˜X with
x ∈R and y ∈{1, 2}. Consider the path
γ : [0, 1] →˜X,
γ (t) = [((1 −t) x + t, y)].
Note that γ : [0, 1] →˜X is continuous and that
γ (0) = [(x, y)]
while
γ (1) = [(1, 1)] = [(1, 2)].
Hence, any point [(x, y)] ∈˜X can be connected to the point [(1, 1)] = [(1, 2)]
by means of a continuous path in ˜X.

Finally, note that X3 ̸∼= X4. Indeed, the property that a topological space remains

two points from X4, then the space obtained is connected while any two points one
removes from X3 results in a disconnected space.
7.17 Let S be an uncountable set and endow it with the cocountable topology. In
this topology every countable subset is closed since its complement obviously has
countable complement. In the other direction, if F is a closed subset of S, then its
complement S −F is open, and thus either F = S, or the complement of S −F,
which is F, is countable. We thus identiﬁed the closed sets to be
F = {F ⊆S | F is countable} ∪{S}.
Since a countable union of countable sets is countable, it follows that the collection
F is stable under countable unions. To see that taking arbitrary unions may take one
outside of the collection F it sufﬁces to observe that a proper uncountable subset of
S exists. Indeed, let X ⊂S be such a set. Since
X =

x∈X
{x}
the set X is certainly a union of closed sets. However, since X is uncountable and
X ̸= S, it follows that S is not closed. We leave it to the reader to exhibit proper
uncountable subsets of S.
7.18 Since A is a real symmetric matrix, it is diagonalizable. It follows that, up to a

7.19 We prove that D is open in X. Take any point p ∈D. Since D is locally
compact, there exists a compact set K ⊆D in D and an open set U in X such that
p ∈U ∩D ⊆K.
Consider the set U −K ⊆X, which is open in X since K is compact in the Hausdorff
space X, and is thus closed. Since D is dense, if the open set U −K were non-empty,
it would intersect D, but this contradicts with
U ∩D ⊆K.
Hence U −K = ∅, that is
p ∈U ⊆K ⊆D.
Hence the point p is an interior point of D. As p was arbitrary, we conclude that all
of the points of D are interior, and thus that D is open.

1. We have to show that V contains the empty set and the whole space
X, and that it is closed under ﬁnite unions and under arbitrary intersections.
Indeed, ∅= V (1 · Z) ∈V and X = V (0 · Z) ∈V . Take V (a1 · Z) ∈V and
V (a2 · Z) ∈V . Note that
V (a1 · Z) ∪V (a2 · Z) = V (lcm{a, b} · Z) ∈V .
Consider the family {V (an · Z)}n∈Z ⊆V . Note that

V (an · Z) = V (gcd{an : n ∈Z}) ∈V .
2. We prove that {0 · Z} ⊂X is dense in X, that is, {0 · Z} = X. Indeed, the only
closed set containing {0 · Z} is V (0 · Z) = X. In particular, X is the smallest
closed set containing {0 · Z}, which is precisely the closure.
3. We prove now that X is not Hausdorff. Indeed, note that for any a ∈Z the closed
set V (a · Z) = {p · Z | p is a prime dividing a or p = a = 0} is a ﬁnite set.
Hence, any two open sets in X intersect and hence X is not T2.

7.6.3 Metric Spaces
7.21 Recall that in a metric space every compact set is also sequentially compact.
Since {xn}n∈N does not admit any convergent subsequence, the space (X, d) cannot
be sequentially compact, and consequently is not compact. Another approach to this
problem is to use the fact that a metric space is compact if, and only if, it is complete
and totally bounded. But clearly X is not totally bounded (though it may be bounded
and it may be complete).
7.22 To show that ℓ∞is connected we actually show that it is path-connected and
thus consider an arbitrary bounded real sequence x = (xn)n ∈ℓ∞, for which it
sufﬁces to construct a path to the 0 vector, namely the constantly 0 sequence. To that
end, consider the function
γ : [0, 1] →ℓ∞,
γ (t) = (txn)n .
Notice that the codomain is indeed ℓ∞, as is immediately seen (in fact this is nothing
but the closure of ℓ∞under scalar products). Since γ (1) = x and γ (0) = 0, it remains
to show that γ is continuous with respect to the relevant metrics. And indeed, for all
t, s ∈[0, 1], it holds that
d (γ (t), γ (s)) = d

(txn)n , (sxn)n
 
= sup
n
|(t −s) · xn| = |t −s|·sup
n
|xn| = ∥x∥∞·d(s, t)
and thus γ is uniformly continuous (notice that we actually proved γ is Lipschitz),
and thus continuous, as was needed.
To see that ℓ∞as not compact it sufﬁces to construct a sequence of inﬁnitely
many vectors with all pair-wise distances equal to 1. This can easily be done in many
ways. We mention here another approach. Notice that the set of all vectors of the
form x = (x1, 0, 0, 0, . . .), with x1 ∈R arbitrary, in other words the kernel of the
shift mapping f : ℓ∞→ℓ∞, is a closed subspace of ℓ∞which, with the induced
metric, is isometric to R with the Euclidean metric. Since ℓ∞is Hausdorff (any
metric space is Hausdorff), if ℓ∞were compact, then R would be compact as well
(since any closed subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is compact). But R is of
course not compact.
7.23 For all n ≥0 let Xn = {x ∈R | f (n) = 0}. Since f is inﬁnitely differentiable,
f (n) is continuous, and thus the set Xn, being the inverse image of the closed set {0},
is closed. Moreover, the condition on the function f states precisely that
R =

n≥0
Xn
and thus we have expressed the non-empty and complete metric space R (with the
Euclidean metric) as a countable union of closed sets. By Baire’s Theorem at least
one of the sets Xn contains a non-empty open set. Thus, there exists an n ≥0 and an

236

open set U ̸= ∅with U ⊆Xn. But any open set in R, by deﬁnition, contains an open
interval. Thus, there exist a < b with (a, b) ⊆Xn. In other words, f (n)(x) = 0 for
all x ∈(a, b). Integrating n times in the range a to b reveals that f is a polynomial
of degree at most n.
7.24 Recall that in any inner product space the parallelogram law
∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2 = 2∥x∥2 + 2∥y∥2
holds for all vectors x and y. We prove that there exists no inner product on
C([0, 1], R) whose associated norm is ∥·∥∞by showing the parallelogram law fails.
Indeed, consider, for example, the continuous functions x, y : [0, 1] →R given by
x(t) = 1
and
y(t) = t.
One computes that
∥x + y∥2
∞+ ∥x −y∥2
∞= max
t∈[0,1] |x(t) + y(t)|2 + max
t∈[0,1] |x(t) −y(t)|2
= max
t∈[0,1] |1 + t|2 + max
t∈[0,1] |1 −t|2 = 4 + 1 = 5
while
2 ∥x∥2
∞+ 2 ∥y∥2
∞= 2 max
t∈[0,1] |x(t)|2 + 2 max
t∈[0,1] |y(t)|2
= 2 max
t∈[0,1] |1|2 + 2 max
t∈[0,1] |t|2 = 2 · 1 + 2 · 1 = 4.
Therefore, the norm ∥·∥does not satisfy the parallelogram law and is thus not induced
by any inner product.
7.25 A metric on the empty set is a function d : ∅× ∅→R+ satisfying the metric
axioms. The domain is the empty set, and thus there is a unique such function, which
is vacuously satisfying the metric axioms. As for a metric on a singleton set X = {p},
that is a function X × X →R+, notice that the axioms require that d(p, p) = 0,
and thus d is already determined. It is trivially seen that this d indeed determines a
metric on X. Finally, if X contains at least two distinct points p an q, then noting
ﬁrst that there always exists a metric structure on d, for instance d(x, y) = 1 for
all x ̸= y and d(x, x) = 0 for all x, the existence of inﬁnitely many non-isometric
metric structures follows by noting that if d is any metric function and α > 0 an
arbitrary positive real number, then deﬁning
αd : X × X →R+
by (αd)(x, y) = αd(x, y) is also a metric on X. Clearly the spaces (X, d) and
(X, αd) are isometric if, and only if, α = 1 or if d(x, y) = 0 for all points. However,

237
since p ̸= q we have that d(p, q) ̸= 0. We thus obtain inﬁnitely many non-isometric
metrics on X.
7.26 Suppose that x ∈X satisﬁes d(x, S) = 0 and letU be an arbitrary open set with
x ∈U. It then holds that Bε(x) ⊆U for some ε > 0. Since d(x, S) = 0 it follows
that there is an element s ∈S with d(x, s) < ε. In particular then s ∈Bε(x) ⊆U.
We thus showed that every open set containing x intersects S, and thus x ∈S.
Conversely, if x /∈S, then (noting that S is closed, and thus its complement is
open) there exists an ε > 0 with Bε(x) ⊆X −S. But then d(x, s) ≥ε for all s ∈S,
and thus d(x, S) ≥ε.
7.27 We establish the metric space axioms for ˜d. Clearly, ˜d(x, y) ≥0 for all x, y ∈
X. If ˜d(x, y) = 0, then d(x, y) = 0 and thus x = y. For all x, y ∈X if d(x, y) < 1,
then
˜d(x, y) = d(x, y) = d(y, x) = ˜d(y, x)
while if d(x, y) ≥1, then d(y, x) ≥1 too, and thus ˜d(x, y) = 1 = ˜d(y, x). Finally,
the veriﬁcation of the triangle inequality follows similarly by case splitting.
To show that d and ˜d induce the same topology, it sufﬁces to notice that an open
ball Bε(x) of radius ε < 1 is the same set when computed in (X, d) as it is when
computing in (X, ˜d).
7.28 We prove that there exists no isometry from R2 to R when endowed with the
Euclidean metrics dR2 and dR respectively. Indeed, suppose that such an isometry
f : R2 →R exists. Take P, Q, R ∈R2 such that
dR2(P, Q) = dR2(P, R) = dR2(Q, R) = 1.
Denote by p = f (P), q = f (Q), and r = f (R) the images in R of the three chosen
points. Since f is an isometry, it follows that
|p −q| = dR(p, q) = dR( f (P), f (Q)) = dR2(P, Q) = 1,
and analogously that |p −r| = 1 and |q −r| = 1. However, elementary algebra
reveals this to be an impossibility.
7.29 We show that ds satisﬁes the metric axioms, remembering that each di does.
Firstly, for all x ∈X
ds(x, x) = sup
i∈I
di(x, x) = sup
i∈I
{0} = 0.
Next, for all x, y ∈X
ds(x, y) = sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} = sup
i∈I
{di(y, x)} = ds(y, x).

Finally, for all x, y, z ∈X, we need to show that

{di(x, z)} ≤sup

for which it sufﬁces to show, for each i ∈I, that
di(x, z) ≤sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} + sup
i∈I
{di(y, z)}
And indeed, given i ∈I, using the triangle inequality for di
di(x, z) ≤di(x, y) + di(y, z) ≤sup
i∈I
{di(x, y)} + sup
i∈I
{di(y, z)},
completing the proof.
For an example showing that the inﬁmum of metric functions need not be a metric
function, consider a set X = {a, b, c} with three distinct points. On it consider the
following assignments of distances
d1(a, b) = 1 d2(a, b) = 2
d1(b, c) = 2 d2(b, c) = 1
d1(a, c) = 3 d2(a, c) = 3
which are easily seen to endow X with two structures of metric space. However, when
computing the minima of the distances one obtains the function e with e(a, b) =
e(b, c) = 1, and e(a, c) = 3. Therefore e(a, c) > e(a, b) + e(b, c) and so the
triangle inequality fails.

1. No, not continuity nor uniform continuity sufﬁces. For instance, let X = R
with the Euclidean topology and consider f : R →R with f (x) = arctan(x),
which is uniformly continuous, and thus also continuous. Then R is complete
but the set f (x) = (−π/2, π/2) is not complete.
2. Uniform continuity is a sufﬁcient condition. Indeed, to show that f (x) is totally
bounded, let ε > 0 be given and we will ﬁnd a covering of f (x) by sets
whose diameters do not exceed ε. Let δ > 0 correspond to the given ε, that is
diam( f (S)) < ε whenever S ⊆X satisﬁes diam(S) < δ. Since X is totally
bounded, one can cover X by sets S1, . . . , Sm whose diameters do not exceed δ.
Each of the images f (S1), . . . , f (Sm) has diameter not exceeding ε, and they
cover f (x), as needed. Finally, we note that continuity alone does not sufﬁce.
For instance, consider the function tan : (−π/2, π/2) →R, with R endowed
with the Euclidean metric and the interval with the induced metric. The interval
is totally bounded but its image, R, is not even bounded.
3. Continuity, and thus also uniform continuity, sufﬁces. Indeed, in a metric space
a set is compact if, and only if, it is complete and totally bounded. Moreover,
for a continuous function f , the image f (C) is compact whenever C is.

7.6.4 Normed Spaces and Banach Spaces
7.31 First we show that the metric d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥induced by the norm of a
normed space V is translation invariant and scale homogeneous. Indeed,
d(x + z, y + z) = ∥(x + z) −(y + z)∥= ∥x −z∥= d(x, z)
holds for all x, y, z ∈V and for any scalar α
d(αx, αy) = ∥αx −αy∥= ∥α(x −y)∥= |α|∥x −y∥= |α|d(x, y).
In the other direction, suppose that V is endowed with a translation invariant and
scale homogeneous metric d. We then deﬁne, for all x ∈V
∥x∥= d(0, x)
and proceed to show that the axioms for a normed space are satisﬁed. It is clear that
∥x∥≥0 for all x ∈V and that if ∥x∥= 0, then d(0, x) = 0, and thus x = 0. For
any scalar α and x ∈V one has
∥αx∥= d(0, αx) = d(α · 0, αx) = |α|d(0, x) = |α|∥x∥.
Finally,forall x, y ∈V wehave,bytranslationinvariance,thatd(x, x+y) = d(0, y).
It then follows that
∥x + y∥= d(0, x + y) ≤d(0, x) + d(x, x + y) = d(0, x) + d(0, y) = ∥x∥+ ∥y∥,
as required.

Clearly ∥f ∥≥0 since the integral of a non-negative function is non-negative.
Moreover, suppose that ∥f ∥= 0 for a continuous function f : [a, b] →R.
If f ̸= 0, then f (x0) ̸= 0 for some x0 ∈[a, b]. Since | f (x)| is continuous
and | f (x0)| > 0 it follows that there is an interval (c, d) ⊆[a, b] upon which
| f (x)| attains values greater than | f (x0)|/2 > 0. It follows that

7.33 We ﬁrst prove that d is a distance on R. Firstly, it is clear that for all x, y ∈R
0 ≤d(x, y) = d(y, x).
Furthermore, if d(x, y) = 0 then |x −y| = 0, and thus x = y. For the triangle
inequality, consider the function f : [0, ∞)] →[0, ∞] given by
f (t) =
t
1 + t
and notice that the proposed distance function is
d(x, y) = f (dE(x, y))
where dE(x, y) = |x −y| is the Euclidean metric on R. Using elementary analysis
it is seen that f is monotonically increasing and that it is concave and thus it is also
subadditive, i.e.,
f (s + t) ≤f (s) + f (t).
We may now argue as follows. For all x, y, z ∈R
d(x, z) = f (dE(x, z)) ≤f (dE(x, y) + dE(y, z))
where we used the monotonicity of f . The subadditivity of f now implies that
f (dE(x, y) + dE(y, z)) ≤f (dE(x, y)) + f (dE(y, z)) = d(x, y) + d(y, z)
establishing the triangle inequality, and thus that (R, d) is a metric space.
We now show that d is not induced by any norm. Indeed, if there were such a
norm x →∥x∥for which d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥, then, for all x, y ∈R and all λ ∈R,
it would hold that

and taking, e.g., x = 1, y = 0, and λ = 2, the left-hand-side is 2/3 while the
right-hand-side is 1/2, yielding an absurdity.
7.34 To show that the topology induced by ∥· ∥2 is ﬁner than the topology induced
by ∥· ∥1 it sufﬁces to show that the identity function
id : (X, ∥· ∥2) →(X, ∥· ∥1)
is continuous. And indeed, given ε > 0 let δ = ε/K. Then, for all x1, x2 ∈X such
that ∥x1 −x2∥2 < δ, one has ∥id(x1) −id(x2)∥1 = ∥x1 −x2∥1 ≤K ·∥x1 −x2∥2 <
Kδ = ε.

1. Given x, y ∈V with ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1, for every 0 ≤α ≤1 the triangle
inequality gives
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥≤∥αx∥+ ∥(1 −α)y∥= α∥x∥+ (1 −α)∥y∥= 1.
2. Suppose now that ∥x∥2 = ⟨x, x⟩for an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩on V , and let’s
assume the ground ﬁeld is R (the case K = C is left as an extra exercise). If
x ̸= y satisfy ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1, then for all 0 < α < 1
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥2 = α2 + (1 −α)2 + 2α(1 −α)⟨x, y⟩.
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality we have that
|⟨x, y⟩| ≤∥x∥∥y∥= 1.
Since x ̸= y and ∥x∥= ∥y∥, it follows that x is not a scalar multiple of y,
and thus the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality holds strictly. Thus ⟨x, y⟩< 1 and it
follows that
∥αx + (1 −α)y∥2 < 1 + 2α2 −2α + 2α −2α2 = 1
showing that ∥αx + (1 −α)y∥< 1 and thus the only points of intersection of
L(x, y) with the unit sphere occur when α = 0 or α = 1 at the points y and x,
respectively.
3. Assume that x ̸= y satisfy ∥x∥= ∥y∥= 1 in a strictly convex space. By the
triangle inequality ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥≤2 so we just need to show that
∥x + y∥= 2 is impossible. Indeed, if ∥x + y∥= 2, then

∥(1/2)x + (1/2)y∥= (1/2)∥x + y∥= 1
contradicting strict convexity.
4. R2 with the ℓ2 norm is strictly convex since the ℓ2 norm is induced by an inner
product (the standard inner product). That R2 with the ℓ1 norm is not strictly
convex is seen by choosing x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1). Then ∥x∥1 = ∥y∥1 = 1
but ∥x + y∥= 2. Similarly, for x = (1, 1) and y = (1, −1) it holds that
∥x∥∞= ∥y∥∞= 1, but ∥x + y∥∞= 2, showing that the ℓ∞norm is not
strictly convex either.
7.36 To show that the kernel of A is a closed linear subspace of V recall that the
kernel, by deﬁnition, is the set A−1({0}). The fact that the kernel is a linear subspace
of the domain was established in the main text and in any case is easy to re-establish
if needed. To show that the kernel is closed recall that the inverse image under
a continuous function of a closed set is closed. Since a bounded linear operator is
continuous, it sufﬁces to show that {0} is a closed set in W. Indeed, the metric induced
on W by the norm is a metrizable topology and thus is Hausdorff, and thus every
singleton set is closed.
7.37 The veriﬁcation that A is a linear operator is trivial, and thus we omit it. Next
we observe that for all x ∈ℓ2 with x ̸= 0
∥Ax∥2 =
∞

k=1
|(1 −1
n )xn|2 <
∞

k=1
|xk|2 = ∥x∥2
and thus
∥Ax∥< ∥x∥
holds for all x ̸= 0. It follows that ∥A∥≤1 and that if ∥A∥= 1, then the norm is
never attained. To see that the operator norm of A is indeed precisely 1, consider
en = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, 0, . . .)
with 1 in the n-th position. It holds that
∥Aen∥= 1 −1
n
and since ∥en∥= 1 it follows that ∥A∥≥∥Aen∥, for all n ≥1, and so we conclude
that indeed ∥A∥= 1.
7.38 The composition of linear operators is always a linear operator, so all we need
to do is show the composition B A is bounded, which will be done by showing the
requested upper bound of the operator norm. Indeed, for all x ∈U
∥B Ax∥= ∥B(Ax)∥≤∥B∥∥Ax∥≤∥B∥∥A∥∥x∥

and the claim follows.
7.39 In an exercise the reader was requested to prove that for bounded linear opera-
tors A, B ∈B(B), if A is invertible and ∥A −B∥< ∥A∥, then B is invertible. With
this result in mind one just needs to correctly interpret the meaning of the claim that
G is open. Let A ∈G be given. To show that G is open it sufﬁces to show that G
contains an open ball with positive radius and centre A. In other words, we need to
ﬁnd ε > 0 such that every B ∈B(B) with ∥A −B∥< ε is invertible. By the above
result, one may take ε = ∥A∥, which is positive (since A is invertible, so clearly
A ̸= 0).
7.40 Notice that the domain of ST is the set {x ∈B1 | T x ∈D(S)}. Given a
sequence {xn} in the domain of ST , suppose that xn →x0 and that ST xn →z. We
need to show that x0 is in the domain of ST and that ST x0 = z. Indeed, since T is
continuous, it follows that
T xn →T x0.
Since T xn is in the domain of S and since S(T xn) →z, it follows from the fact that
S is closed that T x0 is in the domain of S and that ST x0 = z. Thus, as was required,
we see that x0 is in the domain of S and that ST x0 = z, showing ST is closed.
7.6.5 Topological Groups
7.41 Firstly, note that Rn with the Euclidean topology is a Hausdorff topological
space since the topology is merizable. Both the group sum
+: Rn × Rn →Rn,
((a1, . . . , an) , (b1, . . . , bn))
+
→(a1 + b1, . . . , an + bn)
and the group inverse
−: Rn →Rn,
(a1, . . . , an) →(−a1, . . . , −an)
are continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology on Rn and to the product
topology on Rn × Rn. Hence, the additive group Rn with the Euclidean topology is
a topological group. In fact, the map
R × Rn →Rn,
(λ, (a1, . . . , an))
·→(λ · a1, . . . , λ · an)
is also continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology of Rn and the product
topology of R × Rn. That is to say, the R-vector space Rn is actually a topological
vector space.

7.42 Note that SLn(R) = det−1 ({1}), and det: GLn(R) →R is continuous. Hence
SLn(R) is a closed subgroup of the topological group GLn(R). In particular, SLn(R)
is a topological group.
7.43 Note that O(n) = ϕ−1 ({idn}), where ϕ : GLn(R) →GLn(R) is given by
ϕ(A) = At A,
and is a continuous map. Hence O(n) is a closed subgroup of the topological group
GLn(R). In particular, O(n) is a topological group.
7.44 Note that SO(n) = det−1 ({1}), where det: O(n) →{1, −1} is continuous.
Hence SO(n) is a closed subgroup of the topological group O(n) and is thus a
topological group.
7.45 Note that Sp2n(R) = ϕ−1 ({J0}), where ϕ : GL2n(R) →GL2n(R), given by
ϕ(A) = At · J0 · A,
is a continuous map. Hence Sp2n(R) is a closed subgroup of the topological group
GL2n(R), and thus is itself a topological group.
7.46 For a given B ∈SO(n), we construct a path
γ : [0, 1] →SO(n)
such that
γ (0) = idn and γ (1) = B.
The matrix B being orthogonal, there exists an orthogonal matrix M such that
B = MtK M

Hence deﬁne, for all t ∈[0, 1],
γ (t) = MtKt M ∈SO(n).
Since γ : [0, 1] →SO(n) connects idn to B, we get that SO(n) is path-connected
and hence also connected.
7.47 Note that O(n) is the disjoint union of O+(n) and O−(n), where
O+(n) = {A ∈O(n) | det(A) > 0}
and
O−(n) = {A ∈O(n) | det(A) < 0} .
Furthermore, O+(n) and O−(n) are homeomorphic. In fact, the map
Or+(n) →Or−(n),

provides a homeomorphism. Therefore, it sufﬁces to show that O+(n) is path-
connected. But O+(n) = SO(n), and the claim follows since it was already
established that SO(n) is path-connected.

By the polar decomposition theorem there are a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix

Since the topological group SO(n) is path-connected, there exists a path

μ(0) = idn and μ(1) = P.
Hence deﬁne, for all t ∈[0, 1],
γ (t) = CtΛtCμ(t).
Since γ : [0, 1] →GL+
n (R) connects idn to B, we get that GL+
n (R) is path-connected

7.49 Note that since the function det: Mn(R) →R is continuous and surjective,
the sets
GL+
n (R) = det−1 ((0, +∞))

GL−
n (R) = det−1 ((−∞, 0))

By the polar decomposition theorem there exist a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix

it holds that det(P) = 1 and so det(L) = 1. The matrix L being symmetric, there
