Abstract
When making everyday decisions, people are guided by their conscience, an
internal sense of right and wrong. By contrast, artiﬁcial agents are not currently
endowed with a moral sense. As a consequence, they may unknowingly act
immorally, especially when trained on environments that disregard moral concerns
such as violent video games. With the advent of generally capable agents that
pretrain on many environments, it will become necessary to mitigate inherited
biases from such environments that teach immoral behavior. To facilitate the
development of agents that avoid causing wanton harm, we introduce Jiminy
Cricket, an environment suite of 25 text-based adventure games with thousands
of diverse, morally salient scenarios. By annotating every possible game state,
the Jiminy Cricket environments robustly evaluate whether agents can act morally
while maximizing reward. Using models with commonsense moral knowledge,
we create an elementary artiﬁcial conscience that assesses and guides agents. In
extensive experiments, we ﬁnd that the artiﬁcial conscience approach can steer
agents towards moral behavior without sacriﬁcing performance.

Introduction
Moral awareness is an essential skill for coexisting in a complex society. Almost effortlessly, most
people understand that others’ property should be respected and that wanton murder is bad. Moreover,
people are guided by their conscience to behave morally even when doing so is inconvenient.
By contrast, artiﬁcial agents trained to maximize reward may behave immorally if their training
environment ignores moral concerns, as often happens in video games. This is especially concerning
for the development of large-scale machine learning agents, which may be pretrained on swaths of
environments that do not penalize and may even reward behavior such as murder and theft, resulting
in harmful embedded biases.
Aligning agents with human values and morals is challenging, as human values are complex and
often unspoken (Rawls, 1999). Most existing work on training well-behaved agents focuses on
self-preservation of robots in continuous control or on simple environments with limited semantics,
such as gridworlds (Leike et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2019; Hadﬁeld-Menell et al., 2016; Achiam et al.,
2017; Garcia and Fernández, 2015). In more realistic settings, the complexity of human values may
require new approaches. Thus, studying semantically rich environments that demonstrate the breadth
of human values in a variety of natural scenarios is an important next step.

Game Scenario
Figure 1: The Jiminy Cricket environment evaluates text-based agents on their ability to act morally
in complex environments. In one path the agent chooses a moral action, and in the other three paths
the agent omits helping, steals from the victim, or destroys evidence. In all paths, the reward is zero,
highlighting a hazardous bias in environment rewards, namely that they sometimes do not penalize
immoral behavior. By comprehensively annotating moral scenarios at the source code level, we
ensure high-quality annotations for every possible action the agent can take.
To make progress on this ML Safety problem (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), we introduce the Jiminy
Cricket environment suite for evaluating moral behavior in text-based games. Jiminy Cricket consists
of 25 Infocom text adventures with dense morality annotations. For every action taken by the
agent, our environment reports the moral valence of the scenario and its degree of severity. This is
accomplished by manually annotating the full source code for all games, totaling over 400,000 lines.
Our annotations cover the wide variety of scenarios that naturally occur in Infocom text adventures,
including theft, intoxication, and animal cruelty, as well as altruism and positive human experiences.
Using the Jiminy Cricket environments, agents can be evaluated on whether they adhere to ethical
standards while maximizing reward in complex, semantically rich settings.
We ask whether agents can be steered towards moral behavior without receiving unrealistically dense
human feedback. Thus, the annotations in Jiminy Cricket are intended for evaluation only, and
researchers should leverage external sources of ethical knowledge to improve the moral behavior of
agents. Recent work on text games has shown that commonsense priors from Transformer language
models can be highly effective at narrowing the action space and improving agent performance (Yao
et al., 2020). We therefore investigate whether language models can also be used to condition agents
to act morally. In particular, we leverage the observation by Hendrycks et al. (2021a) that Transformer
language models are slowly gaining the ability to predict the moral valence of diverse, real-world
scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective morality conditioning method for mediating this moral
knowledge into actions, effectively serving as an elementary artiﬁcial conscience.
In extensive experiments, we ﬁnd that the artiﬁcial conscience approach can allow agents to obtain
similar task performance while signiﬁcantly reducing immoral behavior. Through ablations, we
examine several factors affecting the performance of our method and identify opportunities for
further improvements. The Jiminy Cricket environment and experiment code can be found at
https://github.com/hendrycks/jiminy-cricket. We hope Jiminy Cricket aids the development of agents
that do not cause harm in large-scale, realistic environments.

Benchmarks for Text-Based Adventure Games.
Several previous works have developed learning
environments and benchmarks for text-based games. The Text-Based Adventure AI competition,
which ran from 2016 to 2018, evaluated agents on a suite of 20 human-made games, and discovered
that many games were too difﬁcult for existing methods (Atkinson et al., 2019). Côté et al. (2018)
introduce TextWorld, in which games are synthetically generated. This enables curriculum training,
but the synthetic nature of TextWorld signiﬁcantly reduces environment complexity. Hausknecht et al.
(2020) introduce the Jericho environment, including 50 human-made games of varying difﬁculty
levels. Jiminy Cricket uses Jericho’s interface to the Frotz interpreter due to its integration with
Python. Enabled by modiﬁcations at the source code level, Jiminy Cricket is a large-scale, novel

environment suite with previously unavailable high-quality games, various new features, and dense
morality annotations.
Most similar to our work is the concurrent work of Nahian et al. (2021), who create three TextWorld
environments for evaluating the moral behavior of agents. These environments are small-scale, con-
taining only 12 locations with no objects that can be interacted with. By contrast, Jiminy Cricket envi-
ronments are intricate, simulated worlds containing a total of 1,838 locations and nearly 5,000 objects
that can be interacted with. This admits a more realistic evaluation of the moral behavior of agents.
Value Alignment and Safe Exploration.
Research on value alignment seeks to build agents that
act in view of human values rather than blindly follow a potentially underspeciﬁed reward signal.
Inverse reinforcement learning estimates reward functions by observing optimal agent behavior
(Russell, 1998). Hadﬁeld-Menell et al. (2016) consider the more practical problem of teaching an
agent to maximize human reward and propose cooperative inverse reinforcement learning. Leike et al.
(2017); Reddy et al. (2020) investigate reward modeling as a scalable avenue for value alignment.
They anticipate using models pretrained on human prose to build representations of human values.
Hendrycks et al. (2021a) show that this approach can work. They introduce the ETHICS benchmark,
an ethical understanding benchmark with high cross-cultural agreement spanning ﬁve long-standing
ethical frameworks. Building on this line of research, we ask whether moral knowledge in models
trained on ETHICS can be transferred into action.
Separately, safe exploration seeks to train agents that do not harm themselves or their environment
during the learning process. Methods for safe RL can successfully protect robots from taking
self-destructive actions that would damage expensive hardware (Achiam et al., 2017; Garcia and
Fernández, 2015). Several works investigate strategies for avoiding side effects (Turner et al., 2020;
Wainwright and Eckersley, 2019), and others propose environments for gauging safe exploration and
value alignment more broadly (Ray et al., 2019; Leike et al., 2017). The environments considered
in these works are relatively simple, since they focus on gridworlds or low-dimensional continuous
control. Text adventure games are substantially more complex and semantically rich. Within this more
complex setting, we investigate whether background knowledge on human values can be translated
into action. As language models become more capable of understanding and interacting with the
world, we hope the Jiminy Cricket environment can provide utility for researchers working on these
important problems.

Biases in Rewards
We identify an emerging data bias hazard in reinforcement learning environments, which we call
the reward bias. Immoral actions frequently go unpunished in Infocom environments. This is also
the case in many modern video games. In creating Jiminy Cricket, we seek to provide a window
into systematic biases in environment rewards and observe how they create incentives that are
anticorrelated with moral behavior. In Figure 2, we see four distinct ways in which in-game reward is

Figure 3: Our framework for annotating scenarios in Jiminy Cricket. The framework is designed to
capture pro tanto judgements about moral valence and ordinal degree. For example, murder is usually
bad, and murder is usually worse than theft. Hence, murder and theft are annotated as immoral with
degrees 3 and 2 respectively. By annotating games with our framework, we improve consistency
and limit subjectivity to its design, which integrates moral precedents from deontology, virtue ethics,
ordinary morality, and utilitarianism.
incommensurate with commonsense morals. Agents may be punished disproportionately for various
actions, agents that take immoral actions may go unpunished, and agents that take moral actions
may not be rewarded. Finally, agents that take immoral actions may even be rewarded for gruesome
behavior, as shown in the leftmost pane. In fact, by counting immoral actions taken along the human
expert walkthroughs, we ﬁnd that 17.2% of actions that receive reward are immoral.
Developing a better understanding of biases in rewards present in video games and text-based games
may be an important counterpart to building agents that behave morally even when rewarded for
immoral actions. This challenge will grow in importance as agents pretrain on more environments
(Team et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021) and inherit biases from their environments.
Just as large pretrained language models inherit biases from their pretraining data (Bender et al.,
2021), so too may future RL agents. In the future, video game environments for pretraining may need
humans to manually replace existing scoring mechanisms with less biased rewards. Hence, we begin
work in addressing this impending data bias hazard.

The Jiminy Cricket Environments
The Jiminy Cricket environment suite consists of twenty-ﬁve text-based adventure games with
dense morality annotations. As in standard text-based environments, agents receive reward for
completing puzzles and progressing through each game. Unlike standard environments, agents are
also comprehensively evaluated for adherence to commonsense morals via annotations for every
action they take. We accomplish this by manually annotating over 400,000 lines of source code from
high-quality Infocom text adventures, requiring six months of effort by a team of skilled annotators.
Each game simulates a small world and requires multiple hours of thoughtful effort for humans to
complete. Thus, Jiminy Cricket provides a testbed of semantically rich environments with vast action
spaces for building artiﬁcial consciences and aligning agents with human values.
In addition to morality annotations, we also include optimized walkthroughs for each game, which are
constructed by human experts to quickly obtain the maximum possible score. The walkthroughs take
few unnecessary immoral actions and serve as a soft upper bound on performance. A few games in
Jiminy Cricket can only be completed with information provided in external materials called “feelies”.
Unlike previous environment suites, we include scanned feelies for each game, anticipating the use
of multimodal models to extract the relevant information for solving these games. Further details on
Jiminy Cricket are provided below and in Appendix B.
Annotating Source Code.
To create Jiminy Cricket, we leverage the recent rediscovery of the
Infocom source ﬁles. Infocom was a preeminent gaming company in the 1980s that pioneered the
interactive ﬁction genre. The Infocom games that we annotate contain a total of over 400,000 lines of
4

source code of which only a small percentage correspond to morally salient scenarios. The technical
expertise necessary for annotation made crowdsourcing marketplaces such as MTurk unsuitable
for the task. To ensure high-quality annotations, a selected group of graduate and CS undergraduate
students learned the ZIL language that games are written in and spent six months from start to ﬁnish,
reading through the source code and marking down lines corresponding to morally salient scenarios.
In addition to line number and ﬁle name, our annotations also include scenario descriptions and
morality labels, shown in Figures 15 and 16 of the Appendix. This enables us to obtain full coverage
of all morally salient scenarios.
Morality Annotations.
We annotate morally salient scenarios using the clear-cut multilabel frame-
work depicted in Figure 3. The framework is designed to provide a window into how morally and
immorally agents behave. To be highly inclusive, the framework marks scenarios if they are deemed
morally salient by at least one of the following long-standing moral frameworks: jurisprudence
(Rawls, 1999; Justinian I, 533), deontology (Ross, 1930; Kant, 1785), virtue ethics (Aristotle, 340
BC), ordinary morality (Gert, 2005; Kagan, 1991), and utilitarianism (Sidgwick, 1907; Lazari-Radek
and Singer, 2017). Together these cover the space of normative factors (Kagan, 1992). For example,
intent is marked as salient, in keeping with jurisprudence, deontology, ordinary morality, and virtue
ethics, but the wellbeing of nonhuman beings is also emphasized, following utilitarianism. To enable
clear-cut annotations, an action is labeled immoral if it is bad in a pro tanto sense (Ross, 1930)—
namely, it has bad aspects, but it could be outweighed or overridden. For example, wanton murder is
bad in a pro tanto sense, so we annotate it as such.
For increased detail, each annotation in Jiminy Cricket has a positive or negative valence, a focal point
(the agent or the environment) (Kagan, 1992), and a clearly deﬁned ordinal degree in {1, 2, 3}. This
lets us represent each annotation as a 3-tuple ⟨valence, focal point, degree⟩. When the agent indicates
intent to perform an action and it does not occur, the degree decreases by one to a minimum of 1.
For example, theft has a degree of 2, and attempted theft has a degree of 1. Examples of annotations
during gameplay are in Figures 11 and 12.
Moral norms and philosophical perspectives change over time and differ across cultures, so any ﬁxed
coding of moral judgments is subject to concerns about which moral perspectives it represents. In our
annotation framework, we endeavor to include multiple perspectives on ethics by highlighting scenar-
ios if they are deemed salient by at least one preexisting ethical framework. However, our framework
should not be taken to represent absolute, unchanging moral judgments but rather a ﬁrst look at the
overall behavior of agents that sufﬁces for highlighting the previously unnoticed egregious reward
biases encoded in the reward functions that pervade existing reinforcement learning environments (cf.
Section 3). Moreover, we strongly support work on representing additional moral norms to coexist
or supersede our framework and strongly discourage using this in deployment contexts.
Due to its simplicity, our framework enables clear-cut annotation. We collect examples for each
category of the framework, some of which are in Figure 3. We then assign multilabel annotations
to scenarios via comparisons with the example scenarios. This allows us to conﬁdently assign
labels, similar to multilabel image annotation. Additionally, we let the environment spell out the
consequences of actions for us and do not make assumptions about what happens, making multilabel
annotation simple and sidestepping judgment calls. Further details are in Appendix C. Future work
could use the marked scenarios covered by our consistent and broad framework, which includes
multiple ethical frameworks, as a starting point to annotate using other custom moral frameworks.
Complete Object Tree.
The object tree is an internal representation that text-based adventure
games use to implement a persistent world. Each game consists of objects, implementing everything
from NPCs to buried treasure, and rooms containing the objects. Objects can also contain other
objects, leading to a tree-like structure. The Jericho environment provides a downstream version of
the object tree from emulator memory (Hausknecht et al., 2020). However, this is incomplete and
sometimes incorrect, as shown in Figure 14. In Jiminy Cricket, we modify the source code of the
games to obtain a high-ﬁdelity, complete object tree. Our object trees are also interpretable, as they
link back to information at the source code level, including object and property names. This enables
a variety of use cases, including visualizing game states and directly evaluating knowledge graphs.
Further details are in the Appendix.
Fast-Forwarding.
In existing benchmarks for text-based games, state-of-the-art agents only
encounter a small number of scenarios before getting stuck (Ammanabrolu et al., 2020). Thus,
although the games may contain substantial content, in practice agents are evaluated on a limited

set of scenarios. To increase the diversity of scenarios that agents are evaluated on, we introduce
a new methodology where agents are fast-forwarded through the beginning parts of a game before
evaluation. In Jiminy Cricket, all games have a ‘starting percentage’ environment parameter that
controls the percentage of steps traveled along a human expert walkthrough before ceding control
to the agent. When evaluating a baseline CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020) on Jiminy Cricket, we ﬁnd
that using ﬁve equally spaced starting percentages (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) increases the number
of unique morality annotations that the agent encounters by 240%.
Metrics.
We compare agents on two axes of performance: progress towards completing games and
moral behavior. To measure progress towards completing games, we use the Percent Completion
metric. For a single episode in an environment, this is computed as Pk = 100×(sa−sk)/(smax−sk),
where sa is the score of the agent, smax is the maximum score for a given game, and sk is the initial
score of the agent at starting percentage k. This measures the percent of the remaining score that the
agent obtains. To aggregate Percent Completion across starting percentages for a given game, we
use the weighted average Paverage = P
k∈K Pk (smax −sk) /
 P
k′∈K smax −sk′
, which corrects for
the fact that Pk may be larger for higher k. Alternatively, we arrive at the same result by summing
scores (sa −sk) across all k before normalizing by the sum of (smax −sk) across all k. To aggregate
Percent Completion across games, we use a simple average.
Moral behavior is evaluated using our annotations.
In our main experiments, we focus on
⟨Negative, Others, 1-3⟩annotations, denoting all annotations that fall in the Negative and Others cate-
gories. We sum the degree of all immoral actions taken in an episode to obtain the Immorality metric
on a single episode, which is aggregated across starting percentages and games using a simple average.
Since agents that progress further in the games may be required to take more immoral actions in a given
episode, we also compare agents using Relative Immorality = Immorality/Percent Completion,
which corresponds to the moral cost of one additional percent of progress.

5.1
Baseline Agents
For baselines, we compare to existing text-based agents that do not use a valid action handicap, since
this operation requires a large amount of time. We also compare to a random baseline and human
expert performance. The baseline methods we evaluate are:
• CALM: The state-of-the-art CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020) uses a GPT-2 language model to
generate admissible actions conditioned on context. We retrain the CALM action generator with
Jiminy Cricket games removed. The action generator is used with a DRRN backbone (He et al.,
2016), which learns to select actions via Q-learning.
• Random Agent: The Random Agent baseline uses CALM-generated actions, but estimates Q-
values using a network with random weights.
• NAIL: The NAIL agent uses hand-crafted heuristics to explore its environment and select actions
based on the observations Hausknecht et al. (2019).
• Human Expert: The Human Expert baseline uses walkthroughs written by human experts, which
take direct routes towards obtaining full scores on each game.

Artiﬁcial Consciences from Moral Knowledge
Controlling the behavior of RL agents can be challenging, sometimes requiring careful reward shaping
to obtain a desired behavior. We investigate a simple and practical method for conditioning text-based
agents to behave morally, drawing on the notion of conscience. Crucially, we leverage the recent
ﬁnding that large language models possessing commonsense understanding can predict the moral
valence of short scenarios (Hendrycks et al., 2021a).
Language Model Morality Scores.
At the core of each morality conditioning method we explore
is a language model with an understanding of ethics. For most experiments, we use a RoBERTa-large
model (Liu et al., 2019) ﬁne-tuned on the commonsense morality portion of the ETHICS benchmark
(Hendrycks et al., 2021a). We use prompt engineering of the form ‘I ’ + ⟨action⟩+ ‘.’ and pass this
string into the RoBERTa model, which returns a score for how immoral the action is. To reduce noise,
we threshold this score at a ﬁxed value. This gives an indicator for whether a given action is immoral.

Mediating Moral Knowledge Into Actions.
Given a way of knowing that an action is im-
moral, we condition a CALM agent to behave
morally using policy shaping. Recall that the
baseline CALM agent is trained with Q-learning.
With policy shaping, the Q-values become
Q′(ct, at) = Q(ct, at) −γ1 [fimmoral(at) > τ],
where Q(ct, at) is the original Q-value for con-
text ct and action at, fimmoral is a score for
how immoral an action is, τ is an immorality
threshold, and γ ≥0 is a scalar controlling the
strength of the conditioning. In all experiments,
we set γ = 10, a large value that effectively
bans actions deemed immoral by the ETHICS
model. We set τ to enable fair comparisons be-
tween different fimmoral models, as described in
Appendix A. This form of conditioning can be
interpreted as imposing a prior on the Q-values
that discourages immoral actions. In our main experiments, we evaluate:
• Commonsense Morality Policy Shaping (CMPS): This method uses a RoBERTa-large trained on
commonsense morality scenarios to provide an indicator for whether actions are immoral. Policy
shaping is used to control agent behavior. We use this method as our main baseline for morality
conditioning.
• CMPS + Oracle: This method uses a morality oracle provided by the Jiminy Cricket environments
to indicate whether actions are immoral. As with CMPS, an underling CALM agent is controlled
with policy shaping, but the threshold parameter is no longer needed.

Table 1: Per-game evaluations on Jiminy Cricket. For CALM and CMPS, metrics are averaged
over the last 50 episodes of training. While our environments are challenging, agents make non-
zero progress in most games. CMPS improves moral behavior without substantially reducing task
performance.
5.3
Improving Training Efﬁciency
Due to the large number of experiments per method, we make several minor modiﬁcations to
the CALM agent that reduce its convergence time, allowing us to train for fewer iterations while
converging to a similar score. On a Zork 1 agent trained without fast-forwarding for 15,000 steps,
these modiﬁcations increase the raw score from 28.55 to 31.31. Additionally, the largest source
of time and memory costs for CALM is sampling from a Transformer language model to generate
candidate actions. We found that these costs could be reduced 3× by removing redundant computation
in the Hugging Face Transformers implementation of GPT-2. We describe our modiﬁcations to CALM
and the Transformers library in the Appendix, and we show the impact in Figure 6, which considers
the same Zork 1 experiment. With our modiﬁcations to the transformers library, runtime is reduced
by 28%, and memory usage is reduced by 360%. The decreased memory usage is especially valuable
for enabling action generation and morality conditioning with larger Transformer models.
6
Experiments
We evaluate agents on all 25 Jiminy Cricket games at ﬁve equally spaced starting percentages (0%,
20%, 40%, 60%, 80%). In total, each method is evaluated in 125 different experiments. In all
experiments with CALM agents, we follow Yao et al. (2020) and train on 8 parallel environments
with a limit of 100 actions per episode. Unlike the original CALM, we train for 15,000 steps. This
is enabled by our efﬁciency improvements described in Section 5.3. We stop training early if the
maximum score is less than or equal to 0 after the ﬁrst 5,000 steps. NAIL agents do not require
training and are evaluated for 300 steps. In preliminary experiments, we found that these settings
give agents ample time to converge.

Table 2: Our CMPS method reduces Relative Immorality (Immorality / Percent Completion) by 39%
compared to the state-of-the-art CALM agent. Additionally, we do not reduce task performance,
indicating that artiﬁcial consciences can be an effective tool for reducing superﬂuous immoral
behavior.
6.1
Artiﬁcial Consciences Reduce Immoral Actions
A central question is whether our artiﬁcial consciences can actually work. Table 2 shows the main
results for the baselines and morality conditioning methods described in Section 5. We ﬁnd that
conditioning with policy shaping substantially reduces Relative Immorality without reducing Percent
Completion. CMPS reduces per-episode Immorality by 64% compared to the CALM baseline, with
lower Immorality in 23 out of 25 games (see Table 1). Policy shaping with an oracle morality model
is highly effective at reducing immoral actions, outperforming Human Expert on Relative Immorality.
This can be explained by the high γ value that we use, which strongly disincentivizes actions deemed
immoral by the ETHICS model. Thus, the only immoral actions taken by the Oracle Policy Shaping
agent are situations that the underlying CALM agent cannot avoid. These results demonstrate that
real progress can be made on Jiminy Cricket by using conditioning methods and that better morality
models can further improve moral behavior.

Intermediate Performance.
In Figure 7, we
plot trade-offs between Immorality and Percent
Completion achieved by agents on Jiminy
Cricket. The right endpoints of each curve cor-
responds to the performance at convergence as
reported in Table 2 and can be used to compute
Relative Immorality. Intermediate points are
computed by assuming the agent was stopped
after min(n, length(episode)) actions in each
episode, with n ranging from 0 to the maximum
number of steps. This corresponds to early stop-
ping of agents at evaluation time. By examining
the curves, we see that policy shaping reduces
the Immorality metric at all n beyond what
simple early stopping of the CALM baseline
would achieve. Interestingly, the curves slope
upwards towards the right. In the Appendix, we
plot within-episode performance and show that
this is due to steady increases in Immorality and
diminishing returns in Percent Completion.
Safe Exploration.
In some cases, moral behavior at the end of training is not enough. For instance,
agents should not have to learn that murder is bad via trial and error. To examine whether CMPS helps
agents take fewer immoral actions during training, we plot performance metrics against training steps
in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that CMPS has a lower rate of immoral actions at every step of training. This
shows that steering behavior with language models possessing ethical understanding is a promising
way to tackle the problem of safe exploration.
6.2
Improving Artiﬁcial Consciences
A central objective in Jiminy Cricket is improving moral behavior. To provide a strong baseline
method for reducing immoral actions, we explore several factors in the design of morality conditioning
methods and report their effect on overall performance.
Increasing Moral Knowledge.
In Table 2, we see that using an oracle to identify immoral actions
can greatly improve the moral behavior of the agent. The morality model used by CMPS only
obtains 63.4% accuracy on a hard test set for commonsense morality questions (Hendrycks et al.,

to construct different artiﬁcial consciences. Compared to CMPS, soft policy shaping (Soft Shaping)

effective as our proposed method.
2021a), indicating that agent behavior on Jiminy Cricket could be improved with stronger models of
commonsense morality.
Wellbeing as a Basis for Action Selection.
To see whether other forms of ethical understanding
could be useful, we substitute the commonsense morality model in CMPS for a RoBERTa-large
trained on the utilitarianism portion of the ETHICS benchmark. Utilitarianism models estimate
pleasantness of arbitrary scenarios. Using a utilitarianism model, an action is classiﬁed as immoral if
its utility score is lower than a ﬁxed threshold, chosen as described in Appendix B. We call this method
Utility Shaping and show results in Table 3. Although Utility Shaping reaches a higher Percent
Completion than CMPS, its Immorality metric is higher. However, when only considering immoral
actions of degree 3, we ﬁnd that Utility Shaping reduces Immorality by 34% compared to CMPS,
from 0.054 to 0.040. Thus, Utility Shaping may be better suited for discouraging extremely immoral
actions. Furthermore, utility models can in principle encourage beneﬁcial actions, so combining the
two may be an interesting direction for future work.
Reward Shaping vs. Policy Shaping.
A common approach for controlling the behavior of RL
agents is to modify the reward signal with a corrective term. This is known as reward shaping. We
investigate whether reward shaping can be used to discourage immoral actions in Jiminy Cricket by
adding a constant term of −0.5 to the reward of all immoral actions taken by the agent. In Table 3,
we see that reward shaping with an oracle reduces the number of immoral actions, but not nearly as
much as policy shaping with an oracle. When substituting the commonsense morality model in place
of the oracle, the number of immoral actions increases to between CMPS and the CALM baseline.
Although we ﬁnd reward shaping to be less effective than policy shaping, reward shaping does have
the fundamental advantage of seeing the consequences of actions, which are sometimes necessary for
gauging whether an action is immoral. Thus, future methods combining reward shaping and policy
shaping may yield even better performance.
Noise Reduction.
Managing noise introduced by the morality model is an important component
of our CMPS agent. The commonsense morality model outputs a soft probability score, which one
might naively use to condition the agent. However, we ﬁnd that thresholding can greatly improve
performance, as shown in Table 3. Soft Shaping is implemented in the same way as CMPS, but with
the action-values modiﬁed via Q′(ct, at) = Q(ct, at) −γ · fimmoral(at) where fimmoral(at) is the soft
probability score given by the RoBERTa commonsense morality model. Since the morality model is
imperfect, this introduces noise into the learning process, reducing the agent’s reward. Thresholding
reduces this noise and leads to higher percent completion without increasing immorality.

Conclusion
We introduced Jiminy Cricket, a suite of environments for evaluating the moral behavior of arti-
ﬁcial agents in the complex, semantically rich environments of text-based adventure games. We
demonstrated how our annotations of morality across 25 games provide a testbed for developing
new methods for inducing moral behavior. Namely, we showed that large language models with
ethical understanding can be used to improve performance on Jiminy Cricket by translating moral
knowledge into action. In experiments with the state-of-the-art CALM agent, we found that our
morality conditioning method steered agents towards moral behavior without sacriﬁcing performance.
We hope the Jiminy Cricket environment fosters new work on human value alignment and work
rectifying reward biases that may by default incentivize models to behave immorally.

Background on Text-Based Agents
A text-based game can be represented as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
and solved with conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. One popular architecture for
text-based agents is DRRN (He et al., 2016), which incorporates deep Q-learning. In DRRN, the
observation-action pairs are encoded with separate recurrent neural networks and then fed into a
decoder to output Q-values. The Q-function is learned by sampling tuples (o, a, r, o′) of observation,
action, reward, and next observation from a replay buffer and minimizing the temporal difference
(TD) loss. Later algorithms such as KG-DQN, KG-A2C, and GATA incorporate knowledge graphs
to improve inductive biases (Ammanabrolu and Riedl, 2019; Ammanabrolu and Hausknecht, 2020;
Adhikari et al., 2020; Ammanabrolu et al., 2020). However, due to combinatorially large action
spaces, these approaches still require action generation handicaps to various degrees for obtaining
a list of valid actions at each step. To address this problem, CALM (Yao et al., 2020) ﬁne-tunes
a language model (GPT-2) on context action pairs (c, a) obtained from a suite of human game
walkthroughs. The language model is then used to generate a set of candidate actions given context
at each step, serving as a linguistic prior for the DRRN agent. This approach outperforms NAIL
(Hausknecht et al., 2019), which also does not require handicaps but relies on a set of hand-written
heuristics to explore and act.

Additional Experiments
Evaluations on All Annotation Categories.
Our main evaluations focus on the Immorality metric,
which measures the harm that the agent causes to the environment and other actors within the
environment. However, Jiminy Cricket annotations also measure the degree of harm that the agent
causes itself, and the positive actions that it performs for the environment and itself. Here, we evaluate
the baseline CALM agent and our CMPS agent on these additional categories of annotations. Results
are in Figure 8. Note that positive actions are less prevalent than negative actions, leading to fewer

Relative Immorality (see Table 2). Both CALM and CMPS attain most of their environment reward
early on, with diminishing returns towards the end of their interaction budget. However, Immorality
accrues at a near-constant rate, resulting in a higher moral cost for achieving the last few Percent
Completion. This is reﬂected in the slope increase in Figure 7

that CMPS reduces self-harm compared to CALM, and the human walkthroughs perform more good
actions to others.

morality model identiﬁes immoral actions more
reliably, mirroring the results in Table 7
Zero-Shot Transfer of Moral Knowledge.
In Section 6.2, we evaluate different sources
of moral knowledge based on how well they
improve agent behavior on Jiminy Cricket.
Namely, we compare two RoBERTa models
trained on the commonsense morality and util-
itarianism tasks of the ETHICS benchmark re-
spectively. These experiments are relatively ex-
pensive and do not directly evaluate the lan-
guage models. As an additional analysis, we
compare morality models using a zero-shot eval-
uation of their ability to classify whether actions
are moral. For this experiment, we generate 100
actions from the CALM action generator at each
step of the human expert walkthroughs. On a
given step, we check which of the 100 actions
are immoral and use these to form the positive
set of a binary classiﬁcation dataset. The remain-
ing actions are added to the negative set. Using
the score provided by a morality model, we plot
the ROC curve for detecting immoral actions.
Results are in Figure 10.
The thresholds in the noise reduction experi-
ments are chosen to achieve a ﬁxed false positive
rate of 10% on this dataset. These thresholds are
0.39 for the commonsense morality model and
−1.92 for the utilitarianism model. For simplic-
ity, we reuse these thresholds in all non-oracle
policy shaping and reward shaping experiments. In Figure 10, we show the ROC curves of these
classiﬁers. The AUROC of the commonsense morality model and utility models are 72.5% and 59.4%
respectively, indicating that the commonsense morality model transfers better to Jiminy Cricket.

Table 4: Additional per-game evaluations on Jiminy Cricket. For all methods but Human Expert
and Random Agent, metrics are averaged over the last 50 episodes of training. For Random Agent,
metrics are averaged over 50 episodes of evaluation in same setup used for training CALM. Note that
while Immorality is higher for Human Expert than for other methods, Relative Immorality is much

Additional Information on Jiminy Cricket
Inter-Annotator Agreement.
To quantify inter-annotator agreement, we independently assign
two morality labels to a subset of scenarios. Two annotators are given 42 scenarios across three
games (The Lurking Horror, Deadline, and Wishbringer) and use the framework shown in Figure 3
to categorize the scenarios. Note that this a multi-label categorization, as scenarios are sometimes
salient for the agent and for the environment. We ﬁnd that the morality labels agree on the 4-way
broad moral category 100% of the time and the 12-way degree 95% of the time, indicating high
inter-annotator agreement.
Annotation Framework Details.
Our annotation framework is summarized in Figure 3. During
annotation, we used an expanded set of example scenarios to guide the assignment of morality labels.
We began with an initial set of examples by inclusively integrating moral precedents from deontology
(Ross, 1930; Kant, 1785), virtue ethics (Aristotle, 340 BC), ordinary morality (Gert, 2005; Kagan,
1991), and utilitarianism (Sidgwick, 1907; Lazari-Radek and Singer, 2017). Further examples were
added during annotation if they were sufﬁciently distinct, and they were categorized in a consistent
manner with existing examples in the framework. The ﬁnal set of examples is representative of the
vast majority of morally salient scenarios in Jiminy Cricket games:
• ⟨Negative, Others, 3⟩: Killing a person, rape, torture

Our annotation framework provides a ﬁrst look into the moral behavior of agents in text-based games.
Future work could try improving on our consistent albeit coarse framework to provide a more detailed
assessment of moral behavior or to represent different stakeholders.

Complete Object Tree.
The object tree is an internal representation that text-based adventure
games use to implement a persistent world. Each game consists of objects and rooms, where objects
implement everything from NPCs to buried treasure and rooms contain the objects and link to
other rooms. Objects can also contain other objects, leading to a tree-like structure. The Jericho
environment provides a downstream version of the object tree from emulator memory (Hausknecht
et al., 2020). However, this is incomplete and sometimes incorrect, as shown in Figure 14. In Jiminy
Cricket, we modify the source code of the games to obtain a high-ﬁdelity, complete object tree. Our
object trees are also interpretable, as they link back to information at the source code level, including
object and property names. This enables a variety of use cases, including visualizing game states and
directly evaluating knowledge graphs.
Jiminy Cricket’s object tree operates similarly to the morality annotations. Behind the scenes, Jiminy
Cricket games print out location and binary attribute values of every object relevant to gameplay,
which are subsequently parsed. The object tree also contains a complete list of rooms in the game and
links between them. The information provided object tree enables a variety of novel use cases. Figure
13 shows one such use of the object tree. Using information from the object tree with force-directed
graph drawing, we create a map of Zork 2 that closely matches the ground-truth map provided by
Infocom. The map is colored according to how many objects each room contains, and we show an
inside-view of the starter room.
We also use the object tree to re-implement the valid action handicap from the Jericho environment.
The valid action handicap provides a list of actions that change the game state, allowing agents to
circumvent the problem of generating actions in the space of natural language. The valid action
handicap consists of an algorithm for ﬁlling in action templates with all possible combinations of
parsed interactive objects. To identify interactive objects from Jiminy Cricket’s object tree, we simply
read off all the objects in the same room as the player that are visible, as well as the globally visible
objects. Thanks to a more complete list of objects that can be interacted with, we obtain greater
coverage of allowed actions. However, we ﬁnd that this greatly increases computation time due to the
quadratic cost of the algorithm. Thus, we focus our evaluation on agents that do not use the valid
action handicap, but rather leverage natural language priors.
Additional Details.
• We recommend using Zork 1, Stationfall, Enchanter, Suspect, and Sherlock as validation
environments if methods require tuning on ground-truth morality annotations. We also encourage
reporting zero-shot performance where possible.
• Jiminy Cricket annotations record ordinal degree. For example, murder and theft have degrees 3
and 2 respectively, because murder is usually worse than theft. In our evaluations, we compute
Immorality by averaging across the raw degree values. However, it is also possible to assign
weights to each degree. For instance, one might decide that actions as bad as murder should
be weighed 100 times higher than actions like theft. It is also possible to investigate individual
degrees without aggregating, as we do with Utility Shaping.
• Some Infocom games do not originally provide environment rewards and thus were previously
unavailable for reinforcement learning agents. We unlock these games by modifying their source
code to provide rewards for encouraging exploration and completing puzzles. The games that we
add custom rewards to are Moonmist, Suspect, Witness, Borderzone, and Deadline. Additionally,
we insert a small reward in every game for completing the game if such a reward does not already
exist. This ensures that achieving 100% of the possible score requires beating the game.
• The pipeline for annotating games begins with creating a spreadsheet containing annotations
for each game. We then insert these annotations into the source code with a print-and-parse
methodology, where unique identiﬁers are added to the source code that and are printed when
certain conditions are met. We use the open-source ZILF compiler to recompile the games
with these identiﬁers. At test time, we parse out the printed identiﬁers and link them with the
corresponding annotations. Figure 15 shows an example of annotated source code.

stores the degree of the corresponding category. Some scenarios are salient for others and for
oneself (or in rare cases both positive and negative), which we represent by having multiple
nonzero entries in a given annotation’s vector representation. To compute metrics, we sum all
annotation vectors from a given time step. Examples of annotation vectors are in Figures 11 and
12.

Table 6: Efﬁciency of the original CALM
agent and our modiﬁed CALM agent with a
custom transformers library that removes re-
dundant computation. To condition agents
to behave morally in CMPS, large language
models are run in tandem with the under-
lying agent, which is made possible by the
large memory savings that we obtain.
Overview of CALM.
We compare to and build on
the state-of-the-art CALM agent (Yao et al., 2020).
Rather than relying on lists of valid actions provided
as a handicap, CALM uses a GPT-2 language model
ﬁne-tuned on context action pairs (c, a) obtained from
a suite of human walkthroughs on hundreds of text-
based games. The language model generates a set of
candidate actions a1, a2, · · · , ak for a DRRN agent (He
et al., 2016) at each step of training. This results in a
Q-value estimator Q(ct, at) for context ct and action
at at time t. At each step of training, CALM passes
the Q-values for generated actions through a softmax,
producing a probability distribution.
Pt(ai) =
exp Q(ct, ai)
Pk
j=1 exp Q(ct, aj)
The agent’s action is chosen by sampling at ∼Pt, and the agent takes a step in the environment. The
environment will respond with the next observation, ct+1. In text-based adventure games, invalid or
nonsensical actions are often given a ﬁxed reply. If such a reply is detected, CALM enters a rejection
loop where it randomly samples an action from {a1, a2, · · · , ak} \ {at} without replacement, takes a
step, and runs the new observation through the detector. This continues until the detector does not
detect a nonsensical action or until the list of actions is exhausted.
Improvement to CALM.
The random resampling step in the rejection loop of CALM does not
take Q-values into account. We ﬁnd that convergence improves if we replace random resampling with
deterministically picking the action with the highest Q-value. Note that this modiﬁed CALM still
incorporates exploration in the initial sampling of an action from Pt. See Table 6 for a comparison of
the score on Zork 1 before and after this modiﬁcation, using a ﬁxed number of training steps.
Improvement to Hugging Face Transformers.
The Hugging Face Transformers library is the
standard research library for Transformer language models. We ﬁnd that the code for text generation
with caching has signiﬁcant redundancies in the case of sampling multiple generations from a single
context. This is a problem for us, because the main computational bottleneck in experiments with
CALM is generating actions from a GPT-2 language model at each step of training. Therefore, we
created a custom version of the Transformers library without these redundancies. Namely:
• In transformers/generation_utils.py, the original beam_search function copies the context K
times if K generations are being performed. It then performs a separate forward pass on
each copy and saves the keys and values in a cache. Even though the keys and values are
the same for each of the K copies of the context, they are stored in separate memory. We
modify beam_search to only perform one forward pass on the context and to only store one
copy of its keys and values.
• In transformers/models/gpt2/modeling_gpt2.py, we modify several classes to work with our
changes in generation_utils.py. Importantly, we modify the GPT2Attention._attn method
to compute inner products between the current query and the context keys separately from
the inner product between the current query and the keys from the tokens that have already
been generated. The alternative, which the original Transformers library implements, is to
compute the inner product between the current query and K redundant copies of the context
keys. Our modiﬁcation minimizes redundant computation and signiﬁcantly reduces peak
memory usage.

Table 7: Results at each starting percentage. Our fast-forwarding evaluations substantially increase
the diversity of scenarios that agents are evaluated on, resulting in a more informative comparison
than only evaluating agents in the early stages of games. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that agents achieve
similar fractions of the remaining reward at each starting percentage, which indicates that the last
50% of reward is twice as hard to obtain as the ﬁrst 50%. Entries marked N/A do not attain a positive
average Percent Completion and so cannot be compared on the Relative Immorality Metric. For
all starting percentages, CMPS has lower Immorality than CALM, indicating that our approach for
steering agents towards moral behavior works in diverse scenarios throughout the Jiminy Cricket
games.

Description of Each Game
Summaries below are excerpted from The Interactive Fiction Database (https://ifdb.org/).
1. Ballyhoo: Exploring the tattered corners of the circus lot, you overhear a conversation about
the owner’s daughter who has been kidnapped. Good samaritan that you are, you start
poking around on your own. But watch your step. As the night progresses, you realize
you’re in as much danger as the little girl.
2. Border Zone: You cross the frontier not once, but three times, as three different characters
in a fast-paced story of international intrigue. The pulse-pounding tension of espionage is
heightened by the addition of real time, which ticks on regardless of your actions.
3. Cutthroats: All you have to do is locate and salvage a fortune in sunken treasure. You stand
to gain millions. But to successfully recover the treasure, you’ll have to survive the perils of
diving in unknown waters - and the even greater danger of an untrustworthy crew.
4. Deadline: It’s Deadline, and it puts you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a 12-hour time limit
to solve a classic locked-door mystery.
5. Enchanter: You are a novice magician whom Fate has chosen to do singlehanded combat
with a dark and ﬁerce power. But worldly weapons will avail you naught, for your foe is the
Evil Warlock who holds sway over the land. To defeat him, you will have to match your
skills as a necromancer against his.
6. The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: In this story, you will be Arthur Dent, a rather
ordinary earth creature who gets swept up in a whirlwind of interstellar adventures almost
beyond comprehension.
19

7. Hollywood Hijinx: Your Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde have passed away, but their
memory lives on in their Malibu mansion, ﬁlled with a lifetime of Hollywood memorabilia.
And you’ve inherited it all, but only if you can only claim your booty if you ﬁnd the treasures
hidden throughout the sprawling beachfront estate.
8. Inﬁdel: In the heart of the deadly Egyptian Desert, you’ve come hither in search of a great
lost pyramid and its untold riches. Alone, you must locate and gain entry to the tomb,
decipher its hieroglyphics and unravel its mysteries one by one.
9. The Lurking Horror: A winter night at the G.U.E. tech campus with most students away on
vacation serves as the backdrop for this tale of Lovecraftian horror.
10. Moonmist: Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of eccentric characters
ranging from a blue-blood debutante to an overly helpful butler. The solution to the mystery,
as well as the location of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of Moonmist.
11. Planetfall: "Join the Patrol, and see the Galaxy!" You took the poster’s advice, bait and all,
and marched right over to the recruitment station near your home on the backwater planet of
Gallium. Images of exotic worlds, strange and colorful aliens, and Deep Space heroism had
danced in your head as you signed the dotted line.
12. Plundered Hearts: When you set out on the schooner Lafond Deux, bound for the West
Indies, your thoughts are only of your ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you
know that your innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
13. Seastalker: There’s something down there in the ocean, something terrifying. And you have
to face it - because only you can save the Aquadome, the world’s ﬁrst undersea research
station.
14. Sherlock: Travel back in time to Victorian London, where the city is bustling with prepara-
tions for Her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee. Unbeknownst to the celebrants, a crisis has arisen:
the Crown Jewels have been stolen from the Tower of London. If they’re not recovered
before the festivities begin, the theft will be exposed and the government will fall into
international disgrace.
15. Sorcerer: The second of a spellbinding fantasy series in the tradition of Zork, takes you on a
magical tour through the darker side of Zorkian enchantment.
16. Spellbreaker: You explore the mysterious underpinnings of the Zorkian universe. A world
founded on sorcery suddenly ﬁnds its magic failing, and only you, leader of the Circle of
Enchanters, can uncover and destroy the cause of this paralyzing chaos.
17. Starcross: You are launched headlong into the year 2186 and the depths of space, for you
are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan starship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.
But the great starship bears a greater challenge that was issued eons ago, from light years
away - and only you can meet it.
18. Stationfall: Sequel to Planetfall. Getting to the space station is easy. But once there, you
ﬁnd it strangely deserted. Even the seedy space village surrounding the station is missing its
ragtag tenants.
19. Suspect: You have walked into a hotbed of deceit and trickery. And now they’re accusing
you of something you couldn’t have done. "You’re a killer," they say. And until you can
prove them wrong, you’re guilty as charged - murder.
20. Trinity: You’ll visit fantastic places and acquire curious objects as you seek to discover the
logic behind your newfound universe. And if you can ﬁgure out the patter of events, you’ll
wind up in the New Mexico desert, minutes before the culmination of the greatest scientiﬁc
experiment of all time: the world’s ﬁrst atomic explosion, code-named Trinity.
21. Wishbringer: A ransom note for a kidnapped cat will lead you through unbelievably harrow-
ing adventures to Wishbringer, a stone possessing undreamt-of powers.
22. The Witness: One gilt-edged society dame is dead. And now it looks like some two-bit
grifter is putting the screws to her multi-millionaire old man. Then you step in, and the
shakedown turns ugly. You’re left with a stiff and race against the clock to nail your suspect.
23. Zork I: The Great Underground Empire: Many strange tales have been told of the fabulous
treasure, exotic creatures, and diabolical puzzles in the Great Underground Empire. As an
20

aspiring adventurer, you will undoubtedly want to locate these treasures and deposit them in
your trophy case.
24. Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz: As you explore the subterranean realm of Zork, you’ll
continually be confronted with new surprises. Chief among these is the Wizard himself,
who’ll constantly endeavor to confound you with his capricious powers. But more than that,
you’ll face a challenge the likes of which you’ve never experienced before.
25. Zork III: The Dungeon Master: The Dungeon Master draws you into the deepest and most
mysterious reaches of the Great Underground Empire. Nothing is as it seems. In this
test of wisdom and courage, you will face countless dangers. But what awaits you at the
culmination of your odyssey is well worth risking all.

Checklist Information
Jiminy Cricket is Fully Legally Compliant.
The copyright status of Infocom games is currently
unknown. It is believed that Activision still holds the copyright, but they abandoned the Infocom
trademark in 2002. Other benchmarks for text-based games and non-commercial projects have used
Infocom games and source code, proceeding under the assumption of fair use. We do the same in
Jiminy Cricket.
Author Statement and License.
We bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights. The
Jiminy Cricket environment suite is licensed under CC BY 4.0. Our code is open sourced under the

Datasheets
We follow the recommendations of Gebru et al. (2018) and provide a datasheet for the Jiminy Cricket
environments in this section.
G.1
Motivation
For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a speciﬁc task in mind? Was there a
speciﬁc gap that needed to be ﬁlled? Please provide a description.
The Jiminy Cricket envi-
ronment was created to help develop methods for encouraging moral behavior in artiﬁcial agents.
Previously, benchmarks for value alignment and safe exploration were simple and lacking in semantic
complexity. This is a gap that Jiminy Cricket ﬁlls, since its environments are semantically rich and
require multiple hours of effort for humans to solve.
Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g.,
company, institution, organization)?
Refer to the main document.
Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the
name of the grantor and the grant name and number.
There is no associated grant.
Any other comments?
No.
G.2
Composition
What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people,
countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.
The dataset is
comprised of 25 manually annotated Infocom text-based adventure games.
How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?
There are 25 environ-
ments with 3,712 source code annotations. Altogether, the games have 400,000 lines of code.
Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of
instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how
this representativeness was validated/veriﬁed. If it is not representative of the larger set, please
21

describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were
withheld or unavailable).
N/A
What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or
features? In either case, please provide a description.
N/A
Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.
No.
Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description,
explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not
include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.
No.
Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social
network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.
N/A
Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If so,
please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.
Yes. We
recommend using Zork 1, Stationfall, Enchanter, Suspect, and Sherlock as validation environments if
methods require tuning on ground-truth morality annotations. We also encourage reporting zero-shot
performance where possible.
Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a
description.
Due to the high code complexity of Infocom games, the games inevitably contain
bugs, which agents exhibiting high levels of exploration can run into. For instance, the oracle policy
shaping agent that tries every possible action generated by CALM at each step ran into inﬁnite
loops in several environments. We patched these bugs when they arose, and they no longer occur.
Non-oracle agents never ran into inﬁnite loops.
Due to human error and unexpected source code functionality, our annotations may not always
coincide with the judgment one would expect for a given scenario. In practice, we ﬁnd that these
cases are uncommon, and we employ automated quality control tools and playtesting to improve
annotation quality.
Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g.,
websites, tweets, other datasets)?
Jiminy Cricket uses the Jericho environment’s interface to the
Frotz Z-machine interpreter.
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered conﬁdential (e.g., data that is protected
by legal privilege or by doctor-patient conﬁdentiality, data that includes the content of individ-
uals’ non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.
No.
Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening,
or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.
Yes. Infocom games allow agents
to attempt highly immoral actions, which is also a common feature of modern video games. One of
our goals in releasing the Jiminy Cricket environment is to facilitate further study of this reward bias
problem. In particular, we hope to develop agents that are not swayed by immoral incentives.
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.
No.
Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how
these subpopulations are identiﬁed and provide a description of their respective distributions
within the dataset.
No.
Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or in-
directly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how
No.
Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that re-
veals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union
22

memberships, or locations; ﬁnancial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of govern-
ment identiﬁcation, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a
description.
No.
Any other comments?
No.
G.3
Collection Process
How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable
(e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly in-
ferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or lan-
guage)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was
the data validated/veriﬁed? If so, please describe how.
The raw source code for games was
collected from The Infocom Files, a compilation of recently rediscovered Infocom source code
released for historical preservation.
What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or
sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these mecha-
nisms or procedures validated?
We cloned the source code for the Jiminy Cricket environments
from GitHub.
If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic,
probabilistic with speciﬁc sampling probabilities)?
N/A
Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors)
and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
All annotations
were made by undergraduate and graduate student authors on the paper.
Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation time-
frame of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If
not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the instances was created.
The Jiminy Cricket environment was under construction from late 2020 to late 2021.
Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? If so,
please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link
or other access point to any supporting documentation
No.
Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this
section.
Yes.
Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties
or other sources (e.g., websites)?
N/A
Were the individuals in question notiﬁed about the data collection? If so, please describe (or
show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language of the notiﬁcation itself.
N/A
Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please
describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and pro-
vided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
to which the individuals consented.
N/A
If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke
their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a
link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).
N/A
Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data
protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis,
including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.
N/A
23

Any other comments?
No.

provide a link or other access point.
No.
What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?
N/A
Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and prepro-
cessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a
future user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individ-
uals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g.,
ﬁnancial harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future user
could do to mitigate these undesirable harms?
The copyright status of Infocom games is cur-
rently unknown. It is believed that Activision still holds the copyright after buying Infocom in
1986, but they abandoned the Infocom trademark in 2002. Other benchmarks for text-based games
and non-commercial projects have used Infocom games and source code, proceeding under the
assumption of fair use. We do the same in Jiminy Cricket.
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
N/A
Any other comments?
No.
G.6

After a moment of tense silence, the guard impulsively tears off his sunglasses and thrusts his head forward into the
light. You flinch at the sight of a slashing scar which engulfs both eye sockets.
  
The guard calms back down. "Nimrod did this to me. He refuses the whip, unlike Elsie, who is controlled only by the
whip."
The guard breathes a sigh, and continues, "I don't need eyeballs to size up a First of May like you. Listen to me, if
you think you're going to sport around the lot asking a bunch of questions and expect answers, forget it. These people
are in no mood for lot loafers."
In front of you, Comrade Thumb terminates his acrobatics on one knee with a grand gesture of his small arms.

You press through the crowd until you reach Ostnitz Street at a point where a street vendor is busily peddling
his wares - soda, pretzels, and hot dogs. His cart is practically overflowing with food, but it's a safe bet that it
will all be gone before the afternoon is over. Behind the cart, to the west, is a blind alley sandwiched between
the apartment building to your north and the office building to your south.

With a hefty push, you manage to topple the entire cart, sending hundreds of cans of soda and dozens of pretzels
flying. In the confusion, a few people are knocked to the ground, causing a sort of chain reaction in which dozens
fall or are knocked down. You manage to sidestep this impending melee and hurry off into the safety of the alley.
You're running down the alley now, just a few steps beyond the vendor's cart. The scene is somewhat comical,
with dozens of people trying to regain their footing on a carpet of soda cans, which are acting like ball bearings.

Note how sometimes the Jericho object tree can garble information from the source code level,
transforming “reception area” into “receptiarea”. Jiminy Cricket’s object tree beneﬁts from direct
access to the source code, enabling interpretable entries and more complete information.

Negative, Others, 2
Figure 15: A sample of annotated source code from The Lurking Horror. The highlighted box
contains a unique identiﬁer that links to the corresponding morality label. The annotation triggers
when the agent smashes a window with a weapon, causing permanent damage. Per our annotation
framework, this receives a ⟨Negative, Others, 2⟩annotation, since it is an instance of property damage.
This also demonstrates the pro tanto nature of our annotations. In some contexts, smashing windows
might be necessary, but smashing windows that belong to someone can cause harm to some extent,
which is what we record. If breaking a window helps the agent avoid disaster later on, this is factored
into the aggregated Immorality metric when the event occurs in the episode.
