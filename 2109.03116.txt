The neutrino ﬂoor is a theoretical lower limit on WIMP-like dark matter models that are discoverable in
direct detection experiments. It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become
hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for
some time that the neutrino ﬂoor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufﬁcient statistics. As a
consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the “neutrino fog” instead. The downside of current
methods of deriving the neutrino ﬂoor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and
energy threshold. Here we propose to deﬁne the neutrino ﬂoor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a
calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental
discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino ﬂoor that is only inﬂuenced by the systematic
uncertainties on the neutrino ﬂux normalisations. Our ﬂoor is broadly similar to those found in the literature,
but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20 GeV. 

ν ﬂoor (APPEC report)
FIG. 1.
Present exclusion limits on the spin-independent DM-
nucleon cross section (assuming equal proton/neutron couplings) [1–
15]. Beneath these limits we show three deﬁnitions of the neutrino
ﬂoor for a xenon target. The previous discovery-limit-based neutrino
ﬂoor calculation shown by the dashed line is taken from the recent
APPEC report [16] (based on the technique of Ref. [17]). The enve-
lope of 90% C.L. exclusion limits seeing one expected neutrino event
is shown as a dotted line. The result of our work is the solid orange
line. We deﬁne this notion of the neutrino ﬂoor to be the bound-
ary of the neutrino fog, i.e. the cross section at which any experi-
ment sensitive to a given value of mχ leaves the standard Poissonian
regime σ ∝N −1/2, and begins to be saturated by the background:
σ ∝N −1/n, with n > 2. The ﬂoor is thus a contour for n = 2.
Introduction.—Modern experiments searching for dark
matter (DM) in the form of weakly interacting massive par-
ticles (WIMPs) have become rather large [18, 19]. It has been
anticipated for some time [20–23] that these underground de-
tectors might one day become large enough to detect not just
DM, but astrophysical neutrinos as well. In fact, it appears as
though the ﬁrst detection of solar neutrinos in a xenon-based
detector is just around the corner [15]. Fittingly, the commu-
nity has begun to collate a rich catalogue of novel physics to
be done with our expanding multi-purpose network of large
underground detectors [24–43].
Unfortunately for WIMP enthusiasts, the impending arrival
of neutrinos in DM detectors is somewhat bittersweet—being,
as they are, essentially the harbingers of the end of conven-
tional searches. These experiments usually look for signals of
DM using nuclear recoils—a channel through which neutri-
nos also generate events via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering (CEνNS) [44–46]. It turns out that the recoil signa-
tures of DM and neutrinos look remarkably alike, with differ-
ent sources of neutrino each masquerading as DM of varying
masses and cross sections [47].
Even an irreducible background like neutrinos may not be
so problematic were it not for the—sometimes sizeable—
systematic uncertainties on their ﬂuxes. The cross section be-
low which the potential discovery of a DM signal is prohibited
due to this uncertainty is what is usually, but not always, la-
belled the “neutrino ﬂoor” [17]: a limit that has since been
the subject of many detailed studies [38, 39, 48–59]. Since
2013 some form of neutrino ﬂoor has been shown underneath
all experimental results, often billed as an ultimate sensitivity
limit [60]. Methods of circumventing the neutrino ﬂoor have
been proposed [61–63]. However, only directional detection
seems to be a realistic strategy for doing so with compara-
tively low statistics [64–71].
One potentially misleading aspect of the name “neutrino
ﬂoor” is the fact that while it does pose an existential threat
to DM searches, the ﬂoor itself is not solid. Firstly, the sever-
ity of the neutrino background—and hence the height of the
ﬂoor in terms of cross section—is dependent crucially on neu-
trino ﬂux uncertainties, which are anticipated to improve over
time. Secondly, the DM and neutrino signals are never per-
fect matches. Even for DM masses and neutrino ﬂuxes with
very closely aligned nuclear recoil spectra—like xenon scat-
tering with 8B neutrinos and a 6 GeV WIMP—they are not
precisely the same. This means that with a large enough num-

Gradient of discovery limit, n = −(d ln σ/d ln N)−1
FIG. 2. A graphical description of the technique we adopt to map the neutrino fog and plot its boundary. In the main panel we show the
spin-independent DM parameter space, colouring the section below the neutrino ﬂoor by the value of n, deﬁned as the index with which a
discovery limit scales with the number of background events, i.e. σ ∝N −1/n. The neutrino fog is deﬁned to be the regime for which n > 2,
with the neutrino ﬂoor being the cross section for a given mass where this transition occurs. The top right panel shows the evolution of σ with
N at mχ = 5.5 GeV between the two cross sections labelled “a” and “b” on the main panel. The lower right panel shows the value n, found
from derivative of the curve in the top right panel.
ber of events, the spectra should be distinguishable [61]. This
fact implies that neutrinos present not a ﬂoor, but perhaps a
‘fog’: a region of the parameter space where a clear distinc-
tion between signal and background is challenging, but not
impossible.
The fogginess of the neutrino ﬂoor has become somewhat
better appreciated recently [51, 63, 72]. However it is some-
thing that is rarely visualised: usually just a single neutrino
ﬂoor limit is plotted. The most common version shown re-
lies on an interpolation of several discovery limits for a set of
somewhat arbitrary thresholds and exposures. It is true that
given the softness of the neutrino fog, insisting upon a hard
boundary will always be slightly arbitrary, however it should
be possible to devise a simpler and self-consistent deﬁnition.
Since direct detection experiments will venture into the
neutrino fog imminently, it is timely to update and reﬁne our
deﬁnitions. In this Letter we propose a new deﬁnition of the
neutrino ﬂoor that situates it at the edge of the neutrino fog.
We aim for this deﬁnition to 1) not depend upon arbitrary
choices for experimental thresholds, or absolute numbers of
observed neutrino events, 2) have a single consistent statisti-
cal meaning, and 3) be ﬂexible to future improvements to neu-
trino ﬂux measurements. The result of this effort can be found
in Fig. 1, contrasted against previously used deﬁnitions. The
technique for calculating this limit is explained graphically in
Fig. 2. The rest of this paper is devoted to summarising the
basic ingredients of the calculation and evaluating several il-
lustrative examples to compare against previous versions.
Neutrinos versus DM.—To begin, we need to deﬁne a DM
model to frame our discussion around. We adopt the following
DM-nucleus scattering rate,
dRχ
dEr
= ρ0
Cσ
2mχµ2 F 2(Er) g(vmin) ,
(1)
where ρ0 is the local DM density, mχ is the DM mass, σ
is some DM-nucleon cross section, µ is the DM-nucleon re-

3
duced mass, C is a nucleus-dependent constant that coherently
enhances the rate, and F(Er) is the form factor that sup-
presses it at high energies. Finally, g(vmin) is the mean in-
verse DM speed above the minimal speed required to produce
a recoil with energy Er. The latter is found by integrating
the lab-frame DM velocity distribution. We assume the time-
averaged Standard Halo Model, with parameters summarised
in Ref. [73]. Alternative halo models will lead to different
neutrino ﬂoors, and including the unknown velocity distribu-
tion as an additional systematic uncertainty will act to raise
the neutrino ﬂoor in general [48]. For this initial explanation
we will frame the discussion around the spin-independent (SI)
isospin-conserving DM-nucleon cross section σ ≡σSI
p , which
is the canonical cross section that experimental collaborations
most frequently set exclusion limits on. The scattering rate
for this model is enhanced by C = A2, for a target with A
nucleons.
Neutrinos can scatter elastically off nuclei and produce re-
coils with very similar spectra to the ones found by evaluating
Eq.(1). Currently, the only measurement of CEνNS is by CO-
HERENT [74, 75], but it is well-understood in the Standard
Model [44, 45]. Theoretical uncertainties, for example from
the running of the Weinberg angle [76], or the nuclear form
factor [53], are subdominant to those on the neutrino ﬂuxes
(see for instance Ref. [59]). We assume a Weinberg angle of
sin2 θW = 0.2387, and for both neutrino and SI DM scatter-
ing we use the standard Helm form factor [77]. Summaries of
the calculation of the CEνNS cross section dσνN(Eν)/dEr
as a function of neutrino and recoil energy, as well the result-
ing spectra of recoil energies for the various targets we will
consider here can be found in e.g. Refs. [17, 61, 69, 78].
The recoil energy spectra are found by integrating the dif-
ferential CEνNS cross section multiplied by the neutrino ﬂux,

We cut off the integral at the minimum neutrino energy that
can cause a recoil with Er: Emin

mNEr/2. We adopt
the same neutrino ﬂux model as in Ref. [69] (Table I), so we
will only brieﬂy summarise some pertinent details. Further
information about neutrino ﬂuxes can be found in Ref. [79].
Solar neutrinos generated in nuclear fusion reactions in the
Sun form the largest ﬂux at Earth for Eν ≲11 MeV. These
will be the primary source of CEνNS events for most DM de-
tectors and will limit discovery around mχ ∼10 GeV. The
Sun’s nuclear energy generation is well-understood, and in
the case of the most important ﬂux of neutrino from 8B de-
cay, the corresponding ﬂux normalisation, is also measured
precisely [80–86]. For the less well-measured components,
several theoretical calculations of the solar neutrino ﬂuxes are
on the market (see e.g. Ref. [87] for a recent review). Here
we adopt the Barcelona 2016 calculation of the GS98 high-
metallicity Standard Solar Model [88]. We adopt the quoted
uncertainty on each ﬂux normalisation, with the exception of
8B which we give a 2% uncertainty in line with global ﬁts
of neutrino data [89]. After 8B neutrinos, the most important
solar ﬂuxes are the two neutrino lines from electron capture
by 7Be, which mimic the signal for sub-GeV masses—these
come with 6% uncertainties.
Geoneutrinos are a constant ﬂux of antineutrinos produced
in radioactive decays of mainly uranium, thorium and potas-
sium in the Earth.
As might be expected, the ratios and
normalisations of these ﬂuxes are location-dependent.
For
concreteness, we use spectra from Ref. [90] and normalise
our geoneutrino ﬂuxes to Gran Sasso, with corresponding
uncertainties ranging from 17–25% [91]. Geoneutrinos im-
pede the discovery at mχ ∼GeV, but only for cross sections
σSI
p ≲10−47 cm2.
Nuclear reactors generate another source of antineutrinos
and inﬂuence the ﬂoor at slightly higher masses.
We as-
sume the ﬁssion fractions and average energy releases from
Ref. [92] combined with the spectra from Ref. [93] before
summing over all nearby nuclear reactors to Gran Sasso [94].
The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is the
cumulative ﬂux of neutrinos from the cosmological history
of core-collapse supernovae, and is relevant for the neutrino
ﬂoor in a small mass window around 20 GeV. We adopt the
ﬂuxes parameterised in terms of three effective neutrino tem-
peratures for the different ﬂavour contributions, and place a
50% uncertainty on the all-ﬂavour ﬂux [95].
Atmospheric neutrinos originate from the scattering of
high-energy cosmic rays. The low-energy tail of the ﬂux is
small Φ ∼10 cm−2 s−1, but is the dominant background at
high recoil energies. We use the theoretical ﬂux model for
13 MeV–1 GeV atmospheric neutrinos from FLUKA simula-
tions [96], placing the recommended 20% theoretical uncer-
tainty. The ﬁnal exposures of experiments like DARWIN [97]
and Argo [98], may reach the high mass section of the neu-
trino ﬂoor set by this background. Since many WIMP-like
models with viable cosmologies (see e.g. Refs. [99–107] for
a truncated sample) populate the neutrino fog in this regime,
it is a critical part to try to reach.
Statistics.—We quantify the impact of the neutrino back-
ground in terms of discovery limits. We compute these using
the standard proﬁle likelihood ratio test [108], which we will
now brieﬂy discuss.
Our parameters of interest are the DM mass and cross sec-
tion, as well some nuisance parameters in the form of the
neutrino ﬂux normalisations Φ = {Φ1, ..., Φnν}. Since the
background-only model should be insensitive to mχ, we can
take it as a ﬁxed parameter and scan over a range of values.
We use a binned likelihood written as the product of the Pois-
son probability in each bin, multiplied by Gaussian likelihood
functions for the uncertainties on each neutrino ﬂux normali-
sation:

The Gaussian distributions have standard deviations given by
the systematic uncertainties that we just discussed. The Pois-

son probabilities at the ith bin are taken for an observed num-
ber of events N i
obs, given an expected number of signal events
N i
χ and the sum of the expected number of neutrino events
for each ﬂux N i
ν(Φj). We bin events logarithmically between
10−4 and 150 keV. The former threshold is clearly not in any
way realistic, however the main advantage of our deﬁnition of
the neutrino ﬂoor will be that it is not based on absolute num-
bers of events. Our choice of threshold is simply to allow us to
map the neutrino ﬂoor down to mχ = 0.1 GeV, but crucially
it does not impact the height of the limit at other masses.
If we have two models, a background-only model Mσ=0,
and a signal+background model M, we can test for σ > 0
using the following statistic,
q0 =



−2 ln

L (0, ˆˆΦ|Mσ=0)
L (ˆσ, ˆΦ|M)

ˆσ > 0
0
ˆσ ≤0,
(4)
where L is maximised at ˆˆΦ when σ is set to 0, and (ˆσ, ˆΦ)
when σ is a free parameter. The model Mσ=0 is a special
case of M, obtained by ﬁxing one parameter to the bound-
ary of its allowed space. Therefore Chernoff’s theorem [109]
holds, and q0 should be asymptotically distributed according
to 1
2χ2
1 + 1
2δ(0) when M is true [110].
Evaluating q0 while avoiding the need to collect many
Monte Carlo realisations for every point in the parameter
space, we exploit the Asimov dataset [108]. This is a hypo-
thetical scenario in which the observation exactly matches the
expectation for a given model, i.e. N i
obs = N i
exp for all i. The
test statistic computed assuming this dataset asymptotes to-
wards the median of the chosen model’s q0 distribution [108].
In high-statistics analyses such as ours, this turns out to be
an extremely good approximation, and has been demonstrated
multiple times in similar calculations [48, 69, 72]. We ﬁx
Nobs to be the expected number of neutrino and DM events,
and require a threshold test statistic of q0 > 9. Therefore our
limits are deﬁned as the expected 3σ discovery limits.
The neutrino fog.—We can now explain how the neutrino
background impacts the discovery of DM. The critical factor
to understand is the systematic uncertainty on the background.
The way to think about this is to imagine a very feeble DM
signal that closely matches one of the background compo-
nents. Such a signal is saturated not just when the number
of signal events is simply less than the background, but when
that excess of events is smaller than the statistical ﬂuctuations
of the background. The regime of parameter space where this
occurs is what we deﬁne as the neutrino fog.
We can quantify the neutrino fog by considering how some
discovery limit, σ, decreases as the exposure/the number of
observed background events, N, increases. The limit evolves
through three distinct scalings.
Initially, when the experi-
ment is essentially background free, N < 1, the limit evolves
as σ ∝N −1. Then, as N increases, the limit transitions
into Poissonian background subtraction: ∝1/
√
N. Even-
tually, as the number of events increases further, any would-
be detectable DM signal disappears beneath the scale of po-
tential background ﬂuctuations, and the limit is stalled at
σ ∝
p
(1 + NδΦ2)/N [17].
If the DM signal and CEνNS background were identical,
the saturation regime would persist for arbitrarily large N.
However there is rarely a value of mχ for which the back-
ground perfectly matches the signal. In theory one could al-
ways collect enough statistics to distinguish the two via their
tails or some other broad spectral features. So eventually the
limit will emerge from saturation, and the σ ∝N −1/2 scal-
ing returns, but only by the time N has grown very large. In
fact, reaching beyond the saturation regime across the mass
range studied here would consume the entire world’s supply
of atmospheric xenon.
The “opacity” of the neutrino fog can therefore be visu-
alised by plotting some gradient of this discovery limit. Let
us deﬁne the index n,
n = −
 d ln σ
d ln N
−1
,
(5)
so that n = 2 under normal Poissonian subtraction, and n > 2
when there is saturation (see also Refs. [111–114] for analyses
in other contexts that also introduce quantities similar to this).
The value of this index for each point in the neutrino fog is
shown by the colourscale in Fig. 2. We adopt xenon in this
example as it is the most popular target and its corresponding
neutrino ﬂoor is the most familiar. Seeing as for every value
of mχ there is a value of σ where n crosses 2, we can join
these points together in a contour to form the boundary of the
neutrino fog, or neutrino ﬂoor.
The result of this procedure is the solid line in Fig. 1.
There, we compared our result alongside two previous def-
initions quoted frequently in the literature. The dashed line
shows the computation which follows the technique described
in Refs. [17, 61], with this speciﬁc limit taken from Ref. [16].
The technique invoked there involves the interpolation of two
limits: a low-threshold/low-exposure one that captures solar
neutrinos, and a high-threshold/high-exposure one that ex-
cludes solar neutrinos and captures atmospheric and super-
novae neutrinos. The two discovery limits are for 400 ob-
served neutrino events so as to put them somewhere around
the systematics dominated part of the fog for certain masses.
We also showed a “one-neutrino” contour, which is formed
from the envelope of a series of background-free 90% C.L. ex-
clusion limits (2.3 events) with increasing thresholds that have
exposures large enough to see one expected neutrino event.
These limits have a similar shape but are higher in cross sec-
tion. One-neutrino contours have an advantage in that they
are easy to calculate, but come with the downside that they do
not encode any information about the DM/neutrino spectral
degeneracy, and do not incorporate systematic uncertainties.
We compare our new neutrino ﬂoors for six different tar-
gets in Fig. 3. In the SI space, they are largely similar, with
the general trend that the kinematics of scattering off lighter
target nuclei means their ﬂoors are pushed to higher masses.
Helium is the extreme case, because Eq.(1) enters the asymp-
totic Rχ ∝ρ0/mχ scaling for much lighter masses than other

targets, hence why the neutrino ﬂoor above 10 GeV is sig-
niﬁcantly higher, and is set by solar neutrinos rather than at-
mospheric neutrinos. Molecular targets like NaI and CaWO4,
also have some distinctive shape differences due to their mul-
tiple nuclei. We show complete maps of the neutrino fog for
these targets in Fig. S1. The broad features observed in these
ﬁgures largely persist for other interactions, such as spin-
dependent scattering. We show examples of these in Fig. S2.
Finally, in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3 we show how our
deﬁnition of the neutrino ﬂoor is adaptable to improvements
in the ﬂux estimates. The dashed line imagines that we have
obtained a factor of 10 improvement in the atmospheric neu-
trino uncertainty, i.e. down to ∼2%, whereas the dot-dashed
line imagines that all solar ﬂux estimates are improved by a
factor of 10. These scenarios are intended to be illustrative,
rather than in anticipation of any speciﬁc improvements. Nev-
ertheless, with a ﬂock of large-scale neutrino observatories on
the horizon [115–119], it is not unreasonable to expect some
improvement to our knowledge of the neutrino ﬂuxes, espe-
cially the poorer measured solar ﬂuxes or the low-energy at-
mospheric ﬂux [69, 120–124].
Discussion.—Given the imminent arrival of the neutrino
background in underground WIMP-like DM searches, we
have decided to revisit and reﬁne the neutrino ﬂoor, or perhaps
more appropriately, neutrino fog. Our ﬂoor can be interpreted
as the boundary of the neutrino fog in a statistically meaning-
ful way. It marks the point at which any experiment will start
to be limited by the background: a cross section that is inﬂu-
enced only by overlap between the DM and neutrino spectra,
and the background’s systematic uncertainties.
In contrast to prior calculations, our deﬁnition of the neu-
trino ﬂoor is not based on arbitrary absolute numbers of
events, but on the derivative of the discovery limit. As such
we arrive at a limit that does not depend upon the recoil en-
ergy threshold, so long as one does not attempt to calculate the
limit for masses that only scatter below the chosen threshold.
This also means that we do not need to interpolate multiple
limits together to map the ﬂoor across a wider mass range,
and can do so with a single calculation.
The main quantitative differences between our result and
those found in the literature are the following. Firstly, we can
see for instance in Fig. 1, that our neutrino ﬂoor is notice-
ably higher in the sub-GeV region where 7Be neutrinos mimic
the signal, as well as the high mass region where the same is
true of atmospheric neutrinos. Previous calculations that used
ﬁxed exposures, ended up placing the neutrino ﬂoor deeper
into the systematics dominated regime for those masses com-
pared to others. On the other hand, the shoulder in the neu-
trino ﬂoor around 6 GeV is lower in our case. This is because
we have adopted a systematic uncertainty on the 8B ﬂux of
2% which is based on a global ﬁt of neutrino data [89]. The
previous calculation of the neutrino ﬂoor assumed a 15% sys-
tematic uncertainty coming from the solar model estimation.
We have applied our new technique to map the neutrino fog
for a range of targets (Fig. S1) as well as a few different DM
interactions (Fig. S2). In the right-hand panel of Fig. 3 we
also showed how our neutrino ﬂoor can be updated in the fu-
ture as neutrino observatories make continued reﬁnements to
measured ﬂuxes. Our technique is such that these improve-
ments can be incorporated without changing the deﬁnition of

6
the neutrino ﬂoor. To accompany this paper, we have supplied
a public code [125] with the tools needed to compute the neu-
trino ﬂoor and fog in the manner detailed here.

FIG. S1. Detailed maps of the neutrino fog for six popular direct detection targets: Xe, Ge, Ar, NaI, CaWO4 and He, chosen to provide a
wide range of nuclei masses. Notable differences between the impact of the neutrino background on different targets can be noted using the
“opacity” of the neutrino fog encoded by the value of n. In other words, the colourscale displays how similar the neutrino and DM signals are
for certain targets, and thus how strongly DM discovery is impacted by the neutrino background. The bright blue colour of the atmospheric
region for xenon for instance can be contrasted against the same region in the Ar, CaWO4, and He panels. This shows that the mχ =100
GeV–10 TeV signal in those targets is notably less well mimicked by atmospheric neutrinos than in Xe or Ge.

FIG. S2. Spin-dependent (SD) neutrino ﬂoors for various targets with nuclear spin: Si, NaI, Ge, Xe, and F. Exclusion limits are taken from
Refs. [12, 13, 126–128] (proton, left) and Refs. [3, 128–134] (neutron, right). The height of the neutrino ﬂoor varies much more widely in cross
section due to the range of values of the nucleon spin expectation value ⟨Sp,n⟩for each target, as well as the fraction of the target comprised
of a spin-possessing isotope. For instance, for SD-proton interactions, the ﬂuorine ﬂoor is the lowest because the proton spin expectation
value of 19F is high ∼0.48 [135]. On the other hand, for SD-neutron interactions, xenon has the highest combination of ⟨Sn⟩on its two
spin-possessing isotopes 129Xe and 131Xe, which make up around half of natural xenon. We show only a few examples here to reduce clutter,
plots for all target nuclei considered can be found at [125].
