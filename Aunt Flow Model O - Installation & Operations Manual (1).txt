avoided.
Do not open the dispenser cabinet unless you have read and fully understand these
instructions. To avoid injury, do not cause the internal gears or arms to operate or move while fingers
or hands are near the moving parts.
●
The dispenser roller inside the cabinet may create a pinch point. To avoid injury, do not insert fingers
upwards into the dispenser cabinet at the opening where the product is dispensed. If the product is
not dispensed, contact hello@goauntflow.com.
●
When operating the dispenser, always press on the center of the dispenser button.

ADA Guidelines
Access to the dispenser should be 40” to 48” above the floor to allow forward and side reach
by anyone in a wheelchair. The dispenser can be operated by using only one hand by pushing
in the push button. There is no need for tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist.
4. Obtain the mounting template from the packaging.
5.
Using the mounting template, position the top hole 61” to 73” from the floor.
This will position the access point (buttons) at the ADA required 40” to 48”
above the floor. Ensure the mounting template is even and level with the
floor.
6.
Mark the location of the 3 mounting holes shown on the template into the
wall.
7.
Drill 3 holes at the marked mounting location using a 3/16” drill bit. Note: If
mounting to drywall, standard drill bits may be used. If mounting onto tile or
cinder block wall, special drill bits may be required.
8. Determine
which
wall
inserts are required, collect from the provided
hardware bag:
i.
Drywall, Tile Wall: Use RED inserts (Fig. 1)
ii.
Concrete, Cinder Block Wall: Use GREEN inserts (Fig. 2)
