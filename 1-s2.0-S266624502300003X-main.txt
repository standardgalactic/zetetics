De novo enzyme design has sought to introduce active sites and substrate-binding 
pockets that are predicted to catalyse a reaction of interest into geometrically 
compatible native scaffolds1,2, but has been limited by a lack of suitable protein 
structures and the complexity of native protein sequence–structure relationships. 
Here we describe a deep-learning-based ‘family-wide hallucination’ approach that 
generates large numbers of idealized protein structures containing diverse pocket 
shapes and designed sequences that encode them. We use these scaffolds to design 
artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of  
the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine.  
The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an 
anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape 
complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with 
high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa) and thermostable (with a 
melting temperature higher than 95 °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on 
diphenylterazine (kcat/Km = 106 M−1 s−1) comparable to that of native luciferases,  
but a much higher substrate specificity. The creation of highly active and specific 
biocatalysts from scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key milestone 
for computational enzyme design, and our approach should enable generation of a 
wide range of luciferases and other enzymes.
Bioluminescent light produced by the enzymatic oxidation of a lucif-
erin substrate by luciferases is widely used for bioassays and imaging 
in biomedical research. Because no excitation light source is needed, 
luminescent photons are produced in the dark; this results in higher 
sensitivity than fluorescence imaging in live animal models and in 
biological samples in which autofluorescence or phototoxicity is a 
concern4,5. However, the development of luciferases as molecular 
probes has lagged behind that of well-developed fluorescent pro-
tein toolkits for a number of reasons: (i) very few native luciferases 
have been identified6,7; (ii) many of those that have been identified 
require multiple disulfide bonds to stabilize the structure and are 
therefore prone to misfolding in mammalian cells8; (iii) most native 
luciferases do not recognize synthetic luciferins with more desirable 
photophysical properties9; and (iv) multiplexed imaging to follow 
multiple processes in parallel using mutually orthogonal luciferase–
luciferin pairs has been limited by the low substrate specificity of 
native luciferases10,11.
We sought to use de novo protein design to create luciferases 
that are small, highly stable, well-expressed in cells, specific for one 
substrate and need no cofactors to function. We chose a synthetic 
luciferin, diphenylterazine (DTZ), as the target substrate because 
of its high quantum yield, red-shifted emission3, favourable in vivo 
pharmacokinetics12,13 and lack of required cofactors for light emis-
sion. Previous computational enzyme design efforts have primarily 
repurposed native protein scaffolds in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)1,2, 
but there are few native structures with binding pockets appropri-
ate for DTZ, and the effects of sequence changes on native proteins 
can be unpredictable (designed helical bundles have also been used 
as enzyme scaffolds14–16, but these are limited in number and most 
do not have pockets that are suitable for DTZ binding). To circum-
vent these limitations, we set out to generate large numbers of small 
and stable protein scaffolds with pockets of the appropriate size and 
shape for DTZ, and with clear sequence–structure relationships to 
facilitate subsequent active-site incorporation. To identify protein 
folds that are capable of hosting such pockets, we first docked DTZ 
into 4,000 native small-molecule-binding proteins. We found that 
many nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like folds have binding pockets 
with appropriate shape complementarity and size for DTZ placement 
(pink dashes in Fig. 1e), and hence selected the NTF2-like superfamily 
as the target topology.

Family-wide hallucination
Native NTF2 structures have a range of pocket sizes and shapes 
but also contain features that are not ideal, such as long loops that 
compromise stability. To create large numbers of ideal NTF2-like 
structures, we developed a deep-learning-based ‘family-wide hallu-
cination’ approach that integrates unconstrained de novo design17,18 
and Rosetta sequence-design approaches19 to enable the generation 
of an essentially unlimited number of proteins that have a desired fold 
(Fig. 1a). The family-wide hallucination approach used the de novo 
sequence and structure discovery capability of unconstrained protein 
hallucination17,18 for loop and variable regions, and structure-guided 
sequence optimization for core regions. We used the trRosetta 
structure prediction neural network20, which is effective in iden-
tifying experimentally successful de-novo-designed proteins and 
hallucinating new globular proteins of diverse topologies. Starting 
from the sequences of 2,000 naturally occurring NTF2s, we carried 
out Monte Carlo searches in sequence space, at each step making a 
sequence change and predicting the structure using trRosetta. As the 
loss function guiding search, we used the confidence of the neural 
network in the predicted structure (as in our previous free halluci-
nation study) supplemented with a topology-specific loss function 
over core residue pair geometries (see Supplementary Methods); 
in the loop regions, we also allowed the number of residues to vary,

which resulted in short near ideal loops. To further encode structural 
specificity, we incorporated buried, long-range hydrogen-bonding 
networks. The resulting 1,615 family-wide hallucinated NTF2 scaffolds 
provided more shape-complementary binding pockets for DTZ than 
did native small-molecule-binding proteins (Fig. 1e). This method 
samples protein backbones that are closer to native NTF2-like pro-
teins (Fig. 1f) and that have better scaffold quality metrics than those 
produced in a previous non-deep-learning energy-based approach21 
(Fig. 1g).
De novo design of luciferases for DTZ
Computational enzyme design generally starts from an ideal active 
site or theozyme consisting of protein functional groups surrounding 
the reaction transition state that is then matched into a set of exist-
ing scaffolds1,2. However, the detailed catalytic geometry of native 
marine luciferases is not well understood because only a handful of 
apo structures and no holo structures with luciferin substrates have 
been solved (at the time of this study)22–24. Both quantum chemistry 
calculations25,26 and experimental data27,28 suggest that the chemilu-
minescent reaction proceeds through an anionic species and that the 
polarity of the surroundings can substantially alter the free energy 
of the subsequent single-electron transfer (SET) process with triplet 
molecular oxygen (3O2). Guided by these data (Extended Data Fig. 
1), we sought to design a shape-complementary catalytic site that 
stabilizes the anionic state of DTZ and lowers the SET energy barrier, 
assuming that the downstream dioxetane light emitter thermolysis 
steps are spontaneous. To stabilize the anionic state, we focused on 
the placement of the positively charged guanidinium group of an 
arginine residue to stabilize the developing negative charge on the 
imidazopyrazinone group.
To computationally design such active sites into large numbers of 
hallucinated NTF2 scaffolds, we first generated an ensemble of anionic 
DTZ conformers (Fig. 1b). Next, around each conformer, we used the 
RifGen method29,30 to enumerate rotamer interaction fields (RIFs) on 
three-dimensional grids consisting of millions of placements of amino 
acid side chains making hydrogen-bonding and nonpolar interactions 
with DTZ (Fig. 1c). An arginine guanidinium group was placed adjacent 
to the N1 atom of the imidazopyrazinone group to stabilize the negative 
charge. RifDock was then used to dock each DTZ conformer and associ-
ated RIF in the central cavity of each scaffold to maximize protein–DTZ 
interactions. An average of eight side-chain rotamers, including an 
arginine residue to stabilize the anionic imidazopyrazinone core, were 
positioned in each pocket (Supplementary Fig. 2a). For the top 50,000 
docks with the most favourable side chain–DTZ interactions, we opti-
mized the remainder of the sequence using RosettaDesign (Fig. 1d) for 
high-affinity binding to DTZ with a bias towards the naturally observed 
sequence variation to ensure foldability. During the design process, 
pre-defined hydrogen-bond networks (HBNets) in the scaffolds were 
kept intact for structural specificity and stability, and interactions of 
these HBNet side chains with DTZ were explicitly required in the Rif-
Dock step to ensure the preorganization of residues that are essential 
for catalysis. In the first sequence-design step, the identities of all RIF 
and HBNet residues were kept fixed, and the surrounding residues 
were optimized to hold the side chain–DTZ interactions in place and 
maintain structural specificity. In the second sequence-design step, 
the RIF residue identities (except the arginine) were also allowed to 
vary, as Rosetta can identify apolar and aromatic packing interactions 
that were missed in the RIF owing to binning effects. During sequence 
design, the scaffold backbone, side chains and DTZ substrate were 
allowed to relax in Cartesian space. After sequence optimization, the 
designs were filtered on the basis of ligand-binding energy, protein–
ligand hydrogen bonds, shape complementarity and contact molecular 
surface, and 7,648 designs were selected and ordered as pooled oligos 
for experimental screening.
Identification of active luciferases
Oligonucleotides encoding the two halves of each design were assem-
bled into full-length genes and cloned into an Escherichia coli expres-
sion vector (see Supplementary Methods). A colony-based screening 
method was used to directly image active luciferase colonies from the 
library and the activities of selected clones were confirmed using a 
96-well plate expression (Extended Data Fig. 2). Three active designs 
were identified; we refer to the most active of these as LuxSit (from the 
Latin lux sit, ‘let light exist’), which at 117 residues (13.9 kDa) is, to our 
knowledge, smaller than any previously described luciferase. Biochemi-
cal analysis, including SDS–PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography 
(Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3), indicated that LuxSit is highly 
expressed in E. coli, soluble and monomeric. Circular dichroism (CD) 
spectroscopy showed a strong far-ultraviolet CD signature, suggest-
ing an organized α-β structure. CD melting experiments showed that 
the protein is not fully unfolded at 95 °C, and that the full structure 
is regained when the temperature is dropped (Fig. 2c). Incubation of 
LuxSit with DTZ resulted in luminescence with an emission peak at 
around 480 nm (Fig. 2d), consistent with the DTZ chemiluminescence 
spectrum. Although we were not able to determine the crystal structure 
of LuxSit, the structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (ref. 31) is very close to 
the design model at the backbone level (root-mean-square deviation 
(RMSD) = 1.35 Å) and over the side chains interacting with the sub-
strate (Fig. 2e). The designed LuxSit active site contains Tyr14–His98 
and Asp18–Arg65 dyads, with the imidazole nitrogen atoms of His98 
making hydrogen-bond interactions with Tyr14 and the O1 atom of 
DTZ (Fig. 2f). The centre of the Arg65 guanidinium cation is 4.2 Å from 
the N1 atom of DTZ and Asp18 forms a bidentate hydrogen bond to the 
guanidinium group and backbone N–H of Arg65 (Fig. 2g).
De novo design of luciferases for h-CTZ
We next sought to apply the knowledge gained from designing LuxSit 
to create 2-deoxycoelenterazine (h-CTZ)-specific luciferases. Because 
the molecular shape of h-CTZ is different from that of DTZ, we created 
an additional set of NTF2 superfamily scaffolds (see Supplementary 
Methods) with matching pocket shapes and high model confidence 
(AlphaFold2-predicted local-distance difference test (pLDDT) > 92). 
We then installed catalytic sites in these scaffolds and designed the 
first shell-protein side chain–h-CTZ interactions using the histidine and 
arginine substrate interaction geometries that were most successful 
in the first round for DTZ. To design the remainder of the sequence, 
we used ProteinMPNN32, which can result in better stability, solubility 
and accuracy than RosettaDesign. After filtering on the basis of the 
AlphaFold2-predicted pLDDT, Cα RMSD, contact molecular surface 
and Rosetta-computed binding energies (see Supplementary Meth-
ods), we selected and experimentally expressed 46 designs in E. coli 
and identified 2 (HTZ3-D2 and HTZ3-G4) that had luciferase activity 
with the h-CTZ luciferin substrate. Both designs were highly soluble, 
monodisperse and monomeric, and the luciferase activities were of the 
same order of magnitude as LuxSit (Extended Data Fig. 4). The success 
rate increased from 3/7,648 to 2/46 sequences in the second round, 
probably owing to the knowledge of active-site geometry from the 
first round and the increased robustness of the ProteinMPNN method 
of sequence design.
Optimization of luciferase activity
To better understand the contributions to the catalysis of LuxSit, the 
most active of our designs, we constructed a site-saturation mutagen-
esis (SSM) library in which each residue in the substrate-binding pocket 
was mutated to every other amino acid one at a time (see Supplemen-
tary Methods), and determined the effect of each mutation onluciferase 
activity. Figure 2f–i shows the amino acid preferences at key positions. 

Nature  |  Vol 614  |  23 February 2023  |  777
Arg65 is highly conserved (Fig. 2g), and its dyad partner Asp18 can 
only be mutated to Glu (which reduces activity), suggesting that the 
carboxylate–Arg65 hydrogen bond is important for luciferase activity. 
In the Tyr14–His98 dyad (Fig. 2f), Tyr14 can be substituted with Asp 
and Glu, and His98 can be replaced with Asn. As all active variants had 
hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors at these positions, the dyads 
might help to mediate the electron and proton transfer required for 
luminescence. Hydrophobic (Fig. 2i) and π-stacking (Fig. 2h) residues at 
the binding interface tolerate other aromatic or aliphatic substitutions 
and generally prefer the amino acid in the original design, consistent 
with model-based affinity predictions of mutational effects (Extended 
Data Fig. 5). The A96M and M110V mutants (highlighted in pink) increase 
activity by 16-fold and 19-fold, respectively, over LuxSit (Supplementary 
Table 1). Optimization guided by these results yielded LuxSit-f (A96M/
M110V), with a flash-type emission kinetic, and LuxSit-i (R60S/A96L/
M110V), with a photon flux more than 100-fold higher than that of LuxSit 
(Extended Data Fig. 6). Overall, the active-site-saturation mutagenesis 
results support the design model, with the Tyr14–His98 and Asp18–
Arg65 dyads having key roles in catalysis and the substrate-binding 
pocket largely conserved.
The most active catalysts, LuxSit-i (Extended Data Fig. 3b,e,h) and 
LuxSit-f (Extended Data Fig. 3c,f,i), were both expressed solubly in  
E. coli at high levels and are monomeric (some dimerization was 
observed at the high protein concentration; Extended Data Fig. 3l) 
and thermostable (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). Similar to native luciferases 
that use CTZ, the apparent Michaelis constants (Km) of both LuxSit-i and

LuxSit-f are in the low-micromolar range (Fig. 3a) and the luminescent 
signal decays over time owing to fast catalytic turnover (Extended 
Data Fig. 7a). LuxSit-i is a very efficient enzyme, with a catalytic effi-
ciency (kcat/Km) of 106 M−1 s−1. The luminescence signal is readily visible 
to the naked eye (Fig. 3b), and the photon flux (photons per second) is 
38% greater than that of the native Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLuc) 
(Supplementary Table 2). The DTZ luminescent reaction catalysed by 
LuxSit-i is pH-dependent (Extended Data Fig. 7b), consistent with the 
proposed mechanism. We used a combination of density functional 
theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
to investigate the basis for LuxSit activity in more detail; the results 
support the anion-stabilization mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 8a 
and Supplementary Fig. 3a) and suggest that LuxSit-i provides better 
DTZ transition-state charge stabilization than LuxSit (Extended Data 
Fig. 8b).
Cell imaging and multiplexed bioassay
As luciferases are commonly used genetic tags and reporters for cell 
biological studies, we evaluated the expression and function of LuxSit-i 
in live mammalian cells. HEK293T cells expressing LuxSit-i-mTagBFP2 
showed DTZ-specific luminescence (Fig. 3c), which was maintained 
after targeting of LuxSit-i-mTagBFP2 to the nucleus, membrane and 
mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 9). Native and previously engineered 
luciferases are quite promiscuous, with activity on many luciferin sub-
strates (Fig. 4ac and Supplementary Fig. 4); this is possibly a result 
of their large and open pockets (a luciferase with high specificity to 
one luciferin substrate has been difficult to control even with exten-
sive directed evolution33,34). By contrast, LuxSit-i exhibited exquisite 
specificity for its target luciferin, with 50-fold selectivity for DTZ over 
bis-CTZ (which differs only in one benzylic carbon; MD simulations 
suggest that this arises from greater transition-state shape complemen-
tarity (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c and Supplementary Fig. 3b,c)), 28-fold 
selectivity over 8pyDTZ (differing only in one nitrogen atom) and more 
than 100-fold selectivity over other luciferin substrates (Fig. 4b). One 
of our active design for h-CTZ (HTZ3-G4) was also highly specific for 
its target substrate (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 4d). Overall, the 
specificity of our designed luciferases is much greater than that of 
native luciferases35,36 or previously engineered luciferases37 (Supple-
mentary Table 5).
We reasoned that the high substrate specificity of LuxSit-i could allow 
the multiplexing of luminescent reporters through substrate-specific 
or spectrally resolved luminescent signals (Fig. 4d and Extended Data 
Fig. 10a,b). To investigate this possibility, we placed LuxSit-i down-
stream of the NF-κB response element and RLuc downstream of the 
cAMP response element (Fig. 4e). The addition of activators (TNF) 
of the NF-κB signaling pathway resulted in luminescence when cells 
were incubated with DTZ, while the luminescence of PP-CTZ (the sub-
strate of RLuc) was observed only when the cAMP–PKA pathway was 
activated (Fig. 4f). Because DTZ and PP-CTZ emit luminescence  at 
different wavelengths, they can in principle be combined and the two 
signals can be deconvoluted through spectral analysis. Indeed, we 
observed that activating the NF-κB signaling resulted in luminescence 
at the DTZ wavelength, while the addition of cAMP–PKA pathway activa-
tors (FSK) generated luminescence at the PP-CTZ wavelength, allowing 
us to simultaneously assess the activation of the two signaling pathways 
in the same sample with either cell lysates (Fig. 4g) or intact HEK293T 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e) by providing both substrates together. 
Thus, the high substrate specificity of LuxSit-i enables multiplexed 
reporting of diverse cellular responses.
Conclusion
Computational enzyme design has been constrained by the number 
of available scaffolds, which limits the extent to which catalytic con-
figurations and enzyme–substrate shape complementarity can be 
achieved14–16. The use of deep learning to produce large numbers of 
de-novo-designed scaffolds here eliminates this restriction, and the 
more accurate RoseTTAfold (ref. 38) and AlphaFold2 (ref. 31) should 
enable protein scaffolds to be generated even more effectively through 
family-wide hallucination and other approaches18,39. The diversity of 
shapes and sizes of scaffold pockets enabled us to consider a range of 
catalytic geometries and to maximize reaction intermediate–enzyme 
shape complementarity; to our knowledge, no native luciferases have 
folds similar to LuxSit, and the enzyme has high specificity for a fully 
synthetic luciferin substrate that does not exist in nature. With the 
incorporation of three substitutions that provide a more complemen-
tary pocket to stabilize the transition state, LuxSit-i has higher activity 
than any previous de-novo-designed enzyme, with a kcat/Km (106 M−1 s−1) 
in the range of native luciferases. This is a notable advance for compu-
tational enzyme design, as tens of rounds of directed evolution were 
required to obtain catalytic efficiencies in this range for a designed 
retroaldolase, and the structure was remodelled considerably40;  
by contrast, the predicted differences in ligand–side-chain interactions 
between LuxSit and LuxSit-i are very subtle (Supplementary Fig. 2b;

challenge in computational enzyme design). The small size, stability  
and robust folding of LuxSit-i makes it well-suited in luciferase fusions 
to proteins of interest and as a genetic tag for capacity-limited viral  
vectors. On the basic science side, the small size, simplicity and high 
activity of LuxSit-i make it an excellent model system for computational 
and experimental studies of luciferase catalytic mechanism. Extending 
the approach used here to create similarly specific luciferases for syn-
thetic luciferin substrates beyond DTZ and h-CTZ would considerably 
extend the multiplexing opportunities illustrated in Fig. 4 (particularly 
with the recent advances in microscopy41), and enable a new generation 
of multiplexed luminescent toolkits. More generally, our family-wide 
hallucination method opens up an almost unlimited number of scaf-
fold possibilities for substrate binding and catalytic residue place-
ment, which is particularly important when the reaction mechanism 
and how to promote it are not completely understood: many alterna-
tive structural and catalytic hypotheses can be readily enumerated with 
shape and chemically complementary binding pockets but different 
catalytic residue placements. Although luciferases are unique in cata-
lysing the emission of light, the chemical transformation of substrates 
into products is common to all enzymes, and the approach devel-
oped here should be readily applicable to a wide variety of chemical  
reactions.

to induce the expression of labelled luciferases. f,g, Luminescence signals from 
cells can be measured under either substrate-resolved or spectrally resolved 
methods by a plate reader. f, For the substrate-resolved method, luminescence 
intensity was recorded without a filter after adding either PP-CTZ or DTZ. g, For 
the spectrally resolved method, both PP-CTZ and DTZ were added, and the 
signals were acquired using 528/20 and 390/35 filters simultaneously. In f and  
g, the bottom panel indicates the addition of FSK or TNF. Luminescence signals 
were acquired from the lysate of 15,000 cells in CelLytic M reagent, and the 
CyOFP fluorescence signal was used to normalize cell numbers and transfection 
efficiencies. All data were normalized to the corresponding non-stimulated 
control. Data are mean ± s.d. (n = 3).

Article
Extended Data Fig. 1 | Proposed catalytic mechanism of coelenterazine- 
utilizing luciferases. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggested 
that the formation of an anionic state is the essential electron source for the 
activation of triplet oxygen (3O2). Supported by both theoretical25,26 and 
experimental evidence27,28, the next oxygenation process is likely through a 
single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism in which the surrounding reaction 
field could highly influence the change of Gibbs free energy (ΔGSET). Finally, the 
thermolysis of a dioxetane light emitter intermediate can produce photons via 
the mechanism of gradually reversible charge-transfer-induced luminescence 
(GRCTIL), which is generally exergonic. As all the historical pieces of evidence 
are based on calculations in the virtual solvents or chemiluminescence in ideal 
organic solvents, the detailed mechanism of a luciferase-catalysed luminescence  
reaction has remained unclear. We proposed that the key step of the enzyme is 
to promote the formation of an anionic state and create a suitable environment 
to facilitate efficient SET. Hence, the goal of this study is to design an enzyme 
reaction field surrounding the substrate to stabilize the anionic substrate state 
and alter the local proton activity, solvent polarity, and hydrophobicity for the 
efficient activation of 3O2.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Schematic representation of colony-based luciferase 
screening. Computationally designed DNA sequences were purchased in an 
oligo array, where the fragments were amplified by PCR, assembled, and 
ligated into a pBAD bacterial expression vector. The plasmid library was used 
to transform DH10B cells. Each colony grown on the LB agar plate represented 
one luciferase design. The plates were sprayed with DTZ solution and imaged to 
identify active colonies using a ChemiDoc imager. Selected colonies were 
inoculated in 96-well plates, expressed, and purified to confirm individual 
luciferase activity. Plasmids can then be individually sequenced to point out 
active design models that provide insights into the design principle and 
enzyme functions or can be subjected to random mutagenesis for further 
evolution. Insert: three luciferases were identified from this screening. We 
refer to the most active and DTZ-specific luciferase as “LuxSit”.

Extended Data Fig. 5 | Predicted changes in substrate-binding free energy

plotted as a function of the relative average experimental luciferase activity. 
The ddGbind of hypothetical catalytic residues: a, Tyr14–His98 and b, Asp18–
Arg65 dyads were generally not the lowest, which suggested that these 
designed catalytic residues are not favourable for substrate binding. Red dots 
represent the wild-type (LuxSit) amino acids. The rank of wild-type ddGbind for 
each position screened for activity is shown with a heat map in c. d–f, The wild- 
type ddGbind of the residues designed for d,e, π–π stacking or f, hydrophobic 
interactions were the lowest compared to the mutation ddGbind values. This 
shows that the sequence is near-optimal for substrate binding and the design 
model is reliable.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Screening of a randomized NNK library at 60, 96 and 
110 positions and sequence alignment between LuxSit and its variants. We 
generated a fully randomized library at 60, 96, and 110 positions to screen all 
possible combinations exhaustively. After the colony-based screening, we 
identified many colonies with strong luciferase activities with DTZ. Each 
colony was expressed individually in each well of 96-well plates (1 mL culture) 
and purified accordingly (see Supplementary Methods). a, Individual 
luminescence activity of each selected mutant was plotted and compared to 
the parent, LuxSit. Luminescence activities were measured in the presence of 
25 μM DTZ. Luminescence activity (RLU) was shown as the integrated signal 
over the first 15 min. Statistical analysis of the amino acid frequency versus the 
luciferase activity at residue b, 60, c, 96, and d, 110. Data are presented as mean 
± s.d. (n varies across each bar as the mutants were selected from a randomized 
library). Arg60 is confirmed to be mutable among all selected mutants as 
Arg60 may be structurally less well-defined because it emanates from a loop 
and has no hydrogen-bonding partner. Ala96 prefers larger side-chain 
substitutions (Leu, Ile, Met, and Cys), and Met110 favours hydrophobic residues 
(Val, Ile, and Ala). A newly discovered variant (R60S/A96L/M110V) with more 
than 100-fold higher photon flux over LuxSit was assigned LuxSit-i for its high 
brightness. In the sequence alignment, mutations are highlighted in yellow 
fonts and grey backgrounds. The conserved catalytic dyads of Asp18–Arg65 
and Tyr14–His98 are in green and blue fonts.

 a, Normalized emission kinetics of 15,000 intact HeLa cells expressing LuxSit-i 
(red), 100 nM purified LuxSit-i (green), or 100 nM purified LuxSit-f (blue) in the 
presence of 50 μM DTZ. The more extended emission kinetics in HeLa cells is 
likely due to the diffusion rate of DTZ across cell membranes. b, Normalized 
luminescence decay curves of LuxSit-i in various pH buffers revealed a 
pH-dependent catalytic mechanism. c, Luminescent quantum yield was 
estimated from the integrated luminescence signal until completely 
converting 125 pmol substrates to photons in the presence of 50 nM 
corresponding luciferase (see Supplementary Methods). Data are presented  
as mean (n = 3).

Extended Data Fig. 8 | Free-energy profile of DTZ chemiluminescence and 
MD simulations of proposed protein–intermediate complexes. a, The 
free-energy profile calculated by density functional theory (DFT) shows triplet 
oxygen can react directly with the anionic species of DTZ (Int1) through the 
reactant complex Int2 and TS1. The dioxetane intermediate Int3 then cleaves 
in an open shell singlet transition state OSSTS2 to form excited intermediate 
Int4*, which rapidly extrudes CO2 and forms the emissive product Int5. Note: 
either Int4* or Int5* emit in the observed region, but the lifetime of Int4* is very 
short and likely completely converts to Int5* before emission. b, Int2 and Int3 
were docked into both LuxSit and LuxSit-i and the bindings were evaluated by 
molecular dynamics (MD). The distances between His98 to O1 (top row) and 
Arg65 to N1 (bottom row) of the substrate were plotted throughout 500 ns MD 
simulations. LuxSit-i (blue trace) binds Int2′ (middle) considerably better than 
LuxSit does (red trace), suggesting that the mutations of LuxSit-i provide a 
binding pocket more complimentary to TS1. This binding orientation brings N1 
of the substrate much closer to Arg65, providing better charge stabilization for 
the high energy transition state. c, Docking of the peroxide anion form of 
bis-CTZ into the pocket of LuxSit-i; blue overlay represents DTZ in the original 
design model. During MD simulation, the added benzylic carbon of bis-CTZ 
(green trace) disrupts the shape complementarity between LuxSit-i and the 
transition states (TS1 and TS2), reducing the charge stabilization by Arg65. 
This charge stabilization is necessary for the reaction to proceed, explaining 
the high substrate specificity of LuxSit-i for DTZ over bis-CTZ.
