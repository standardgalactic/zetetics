In Pāṇini We Trust: Discovering the Algorithm for Rule Conflict Resolution in the Aṣṭādhyāyī 
-Rishi Rajpopat 
Abstract 
If two rules are simultaneously applicable at a given step in a Pāṇinian derivation, which of the 
two should be applied? Put differently, in the event of a ‘conflict’ between the two rules, which 
rule wins?  
In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini has taught only one metarule, namely, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam, to address this problem. Traditional scholars interpret it as follows: ‘in the event of a 
conflict between two rules of equal strength, the rule that comes later in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, wins.’ 
Pāṇinīyas claim that if one rule is nitya, and its simultaneously applicable counterpart is anitya, 
or if one is antaraṅga and the other bahiraṅga, or if one is an apavāda (exception) and the 
other the utsarga (general rule), then the two rules are not equally strong and consequently, we 
cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve the conflict between them. The nitya, antaraṅga and apavāda rules 
are stronger than their respective counterparts and thus win against them.  
But this system of conflict resolution is far from perfect: the tradition has had to write numerous 
additional metarules to account for umpteen exceptions. In this thesis, I propose my own 
solution to the problem of rule conflict which I have developed by relying exclusively on 
Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. I replace the aforementioned traditional categories of rule conflict with a 
new classification, based on whether the two rules are applicable to the same operand (Same 
Operand Interaction, SOI), or to two different operands (Different Operand Interaction, DOI).  
I argue that, in case of SOI, the more specific i.e., the ‘exception’ rule, wins. Additionally, I 
develop a systematic method for the identification of the ‘more specific’ rule – based on 
Pāṇini’s style of rule composition. I also argue that, in order to deal with DOI, Pāṇini has 
composed 1.4.2, which I interpret as follows: ‘in case of DOI (vipratiṣedha), the right-hand 
side (para) operation (kārya) prevails.’ I support my conclusions with both textual and 
derivational evidence.  
I also discuss my interpretation of certain metarules teaching substitution and augmentation, 
the concept of aṅga, and the asiddha and asiddhavat rules and expound on not only their 
interaction with 1.4.2 but also their influence on the overall functioning of the Pāṇinian 
machine.

I want to thank the late Ms. Ranjana Deshpande who, through her enriching and effortless 
pedagogy, lit the spark of Sanskrit in me during my high school years. Secondly, I wish to 
express my gratitude towards my Guru, Ms. Geeta Gandhi, who initiated me into the 
delightful world of Pāṇinian grammar and who, with her wealth of expertise and experience, 
continues to motivate and inspire me to this day. I am very grateful to Dr. James Benson who 
supervised my Masters at the University of Oxford, and whose in-depth, almost spellbinding, 
knowledge of the Aṣṭādhyāyī afforded me the opportunity to improve my understanding of its 
infrastructure.  
I am most grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Vincenzo Vergiani, whose enlightening insights into 
the evolution of the Indian grammatical tradition helped me develop and articulate my thoughts 
in a cogent manner. I think it would be no exaggeration to say that, were it not for his 
perceptiveness, knowledge, wisdom, open-mindedness, magnanimity and liberal attitude, it 
would have been absolutely impossible for me to produce this thesis. Right from mentoring 
and encouraging me, to having faith in my abilities, to challenging and criticizing me, Dr. 
Vergiani did everything that was necessary for me to thrive and flourish at Cambridge. Given 
that he has single-handedly overlooked my growth as a researcher for the last four years, he 
deserves no less than a lion’s share of credit for this thesis.  
I wish to offer special thanks to Dr. Maria Piera Candotti (University of Pisa), whose 
remarkable familiarity with both traditional and modern argumentation on a variety of 
derivational issues opened my eyes to multiple new perspectives towards the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I 
want to wholeheartedly thank Dr. Balram Shukla (University of Delhi) who, through his 
striking knowledge and perspicacity, enabled me to truly appreciate the role of the tradition in 
preserving and decoding the Aṣṭādhyāyī. I owe a significant debt of gratitude to Dr. Tanuja 
Ajotikar (Assistant Professor, The Sanskrit Library) – who has been nothing short of a living 
encyclopaedia on all things Pāṇinian – for helping me appreciate the nuances of traditional 
opinions on a wide range of derivational topics. I also want to sincerely thank Prof. Diwakar 
Acharya (University of Oxford) and Dr. John Lowe (University of Oxford) for their 
thoughtful advice on important academic matters.  
I am extremely grateful to faculty members, fellow students and colleagues in Indology and 
other fields, with whom I had many opportunities to have stimulating conversations which 
facilitated my learning and maturation. I am privileged to enjoy, and very grateful for, the

unwavering affection and solidarity of my family and friends. Above all, I remain perennially 
indebted to Bhagavān who has blessed me with the curiosity and enthusiasm that drove this 
doctoral investigation to fruitful completion.

Chapter One 
1.1 Introduction to the Aṣṭādhyāyī   
 
Pāṇini1 composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī around 350 BC2 in North-Western South Asia.3 The 
Aṣṭādhyāyī is a samāhāra ‘collection’ of aṣṭa(n) ‘eight’ adhyāyas ‘books’, hence the name 
Aṣṭa-adhyāy(a)-ī. Each book of the Aṣṭādhyāyī has four pādas ‘chapters’ that are made up of 
sūtras ‘rules’. In all, the Aṣṭādhyāyī comprises about 4000 rules. The Aṣṭādhyāyī is a 
comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language as known to its author Pāṇini. It stands out 
for doing more than merely describing its object language: the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a full-fledged 
machine which helps construct grammatically correct Sanskrit words and sentences through a 
step-by-step derivation4 process. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not give us a general 
introduction to his work, nor does he discuss the theoretical principles that have been used to 
construct his sūtras. He conveys whatever has to be said, through his sūtras alone. 
The first two books are mainly composed of saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition rules’ and paribhāṣā 
sūtras ‘metarules’5. The remaining books mainly consist of vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’. 
Books three to five teach the addition of both inflectional and derivational affixes to bases. 
Book three teaches the addition of various affixes to verbal roots and stems, and books four 
and five teach the addition of different affixes to nominal stems. Books six, seven and eight 
teach various morpho-phonological operations that should be performed on both bases and 
 
1 There are many disagreements about the dates, and what I mention here are the dates agreed upon by 
much recent scholarship.  
2 Cardona 1976: 267-268. 
3 I say ‘composed’ and not ‘wrote’ because scholars disagree on whether he used the aid of writing to 
create his grammar. In recent times, Vergiani (2020) has present strong arguments in favour of the 
proposition that Pāṇini did use written means to put together his magnum opus. Writing or not, it is 
known that, just as happened with the Vedas, the Aṣṭādhyāyī too was orally transmitted from one 
generation to the next. 
4 In the modern literature on the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition, it is customary to use the verb ‘to 
derive’ and its derivatives (e.g., derivation) to simply mean ‘to construct’. The verb ‘to derive’ is used 
in the context of not only derivational but also inflectional morphology. I shall abide by this convention 
in this thesis. 
5 Metarules teach us how rules should be interpreted, how certain operations should be undertaken, and 
how rules interact with one another.

affixes. Different kinds of rules from multiple books are required to derive a word using 
Pāṇini’s method. 
To truly understand the Aṣṭādhyāyī, one needs to familiarize oneself with the methodology 
used by Pāṇini to compose and arrange rules in his work. Pāṇini’s style is not entirely self-
evident, and one faces challenges at multiple levels when attempting to unravel the enigma that 
is the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Firstly, it is not easy to determine the exact meanings of Pāṇini’s rules 
because the sūtra style in which they are composed is very concise and compact. Much 
information is often packed into a few words, thereby making it considerably difficult to 
comprehend their exact purport. Consider 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ, which teaches that a verbal base6, 
which has not undergone reduplication, undergoes reduplication in the presence of affixes saN7 
and yaṄ, the desiderative and intensive markers, respectively.8 The question about whether 
sanyaṅoḥ is a genitive dual or a locative dual is a crucial one, and has important implications 
for how we conceptualize prakriyā ‘the (derivational) procedure’.9  
Secondly, to make sense of any given rule, it is essential to take into account the contents of 
preceding rules. This is because Pāṇini uses a device called anuvr̥ tti ‘continuation into the 
following rules’ to economically express his observations: to understand the complete and 
correct meaning of a rule, certain words from preceding sūtras may need to be borrowed into 
that rule by anuvr̥ tti. But there is no universal convention as to which terms are supposed to or 
can become anuvr̥ tta ‘continued’ into a certain rule. For example, consider 1.1.33 
prathamacaramatayālpārdhakatipayanemāś ca, which teaches that certain words are called 
sarvanāma. But it is difficult to determine whether or not the words from the previous rule 
1.1.32 vibhāṣā jasi should be continued into this rule. If they are continued into 1.1.33, then 
 
6 Note that the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 
ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 
7 In this thesis, I use capital letters in Pāṇinian morphemes to represent itsaṁjñakas (taught in 1.3.2 
upadeśe’j anunāsika it and following sūtras). Such its (commonly called anubandhas in post-Pāṇinian 
grammatical literature) are used to mark certain properties of the item to which they are added, and are 
not actually part of the item. Their unconditional deletion is taught by 1.3.9 tasya lopaḥ. 
8 Note that, in this thesis, I have used English translations of Pāṇini’s rules by Sharma (1987-2003) and 
Katre (1987), for many but not all rules. I have taken the liberty to edit their translations as required. 
For the remaining rules, I have presented my own translations.

this would restrict 1.1.33 only to those cases where these stems are followed by the nominative 
plural affix Jas, and would also make 1.1.33 optional.10  
Thirdly, even after the meaning of the rule has been understood, it does not become patently 
obvious how to use it. This is because Pāṇini’s rules are placed together on the basis of topical 
and functional categories, and not according to the derivations in which they participate.11 
Thus, one cannot easily ascertain the order in which rules apply or select the step at which they 
become applicable. For example, consider the rule 3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥ luṭoḥ, which teaches that 
the affixes sya and tāsI should be added to the left of LR̥  (LR̥ Ṭ and LR̥ Ṅ) and LUṬ respectively. 
But the question that has troubled both traditional and modern scholars is: should and can this 
rule apply before the lakāras are replaced with finite verb endings (3.4.77 lasya; 3.4.78 tip-tas-
jhi…12)?13 
Fourthly, after one has come to a conclusion about where to apply a given rule, one is often 
faced with situations in which two rules become applicable at the same step. In many such 
cases, one rule blocks the other, or both rules block each other. This is called ‘rule conflict’. 
According to the tradition, a metarule taught by Pāṇini, namely 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam addresses this issue. However, it seems unable to give the right answer when applied 
to certain cases of conflict. 
We can conclude that the Aṣṭādhyāyī is a very sophisticated grammar, and that to operate its 
grammatical machine, we have to understand it at multiple levels. What would an early 
grammarian or linguist have done in order to interpret the Aṣṭādhyāyī independently? With 
negligible access to any commentary on the text, and with limited or no guidance of a teacher 
well-versed in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a scholar would have taken notes for himself in order to 
comprehend, analyse and corroborate the teachings of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. He would have started 
by paraphrasing the contents of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to establish what they exactly mean, both 
independently and in the context of the preceding rules.   
 
10 Bloomfield 1927: 61-70.  
11 Besides, it is not possible to arrange rules on the basis of the derivations in which they participate 
because most rules participate in umpteen different derivations.

To ensure that he had understood such a complex grammar correctly, or to confirm that the 
grammar accurately describes the structure of the language, a scholar would have tried to verify 
the validity and accuracy of different rules against spoken language or attested literature. He 
would have gradually developed his own ideas about where rules should apply, and how 
derivations should proceed. He would have noticed how rules interact amongst themselves and 
would have come up with ways to classify and deal with such interactions. He would also have 
suggested certain changes to these rules to make them more precise, to help them better 
characterize their object language and/or to help them function more consistently with other 
rules within the Pāṇinian system. 
This is presumably what happened in the Indian grammatical tradition when Kātyāyana 
understood the meanings and functions of Pāṇinian rules on the basis of his independent study 
of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.14 Then as a teacher, he also taught them to his pupils using his notes on the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī as pedagogical aid. His students taught the Aṣṭādhyāyī to their students using 
Kātyāyana’s work and also commented on Kātyāyana’s writings, thereby sharing their own 
opinions, interpretations and analyses with their students and readers. Successive generations 
participated in this process of knowledge processing, production and transmission, thereby 
giving birth to the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition.  
The texts of the Pāṇinian grammatical tradition have played a dominant role in influencing and 
shaping our understanding of, and opinions about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. They also give us significant 
insights into the evolution of different ideas in the Pāṇinian tradition. Below I introduce the 
texts that I shall refer to in the rest of the thesis and briefly discuss the history of the Pāṇinian 
tradition with special reference to metarules. 
 
1.2 Metarules in the Pāṇinian Grammatical Tradition  
Early grammatical thought in the Indian subcontinent, as represented by the works called 
Prātiśākhyas, was intended to assist the recitation of Vedas by explaining the pronunciation of 
accents and dissolution of sandhis. Their objective was merely descriptive, that is, to make 
grammatical observations and offer clarifications where necessary. But a number of 
 
14 I think that there was a break in the transmission of the Aṣṭādhyāyī between Pāṇini and Kātyāyana, 
since Kātyāyana seems to be in the process of understanding the Aṣṭādhyāyī without much help from 
anyone else. I shall furnish evidence to support this statement in chapter 6. 

12 
 
independent and full-fledged grammars emerged subsequently which sought to ‘derive’ 
language rather than simply ‘describe’ it: they built mechanistic systems which perform various 
operations on bases and affixes in order to produce correct word forms and, using these fully 
derived words, to construct meaningful sentences.  
While Pāṇini himself mentions many of his predecessors in his sūtras, his work, the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, remains the oldest surviving derivational grammar of Sanskrit. Composing such a 
grammar required Pāṇini to meticulously design every aspect of the derivational procedure, 
which explains why Pāṇini made significant efforts in formulating his paribhāṣā sūtras 
‘metarules’. These metarules play a pivotal role in the correct interpretation and application of 
vidhi sūtras ‘operation rules’ at every step of the derivation, thereby ensuring that the 
derivational machine produces the grammatically correct output. 
Given the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s remarkable exhaustiveness and accuracy, it is not surprising that 
Kātyāyana, around 250 BC15, undertook a systematic analysis of what must have been for him 
an unprecedented and extraordinary treatise. Kātyāyana recorded his thoughts and findings in 
the form of vārttikas, which are short statements seeking to explain, examine, criticize and 
sometimes integrate Pāṇini’s rules with additions. Without overlooking the more specific and 
individual aspects of the grammar, Kātyāyana sought to develop a broad perspective about the 
functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as an integrated machine. This involved interpreting the 
metarules of Pāṇini’s grammar, providing examples and counterexamples to determine their 
verity, and composing new metarules to help the Pāṇinian system run even more smoothly. 
Around 150 BC, Patañjali wrote the Mahābhāṣya, which is a commentary on Kātyāyana’s 
vārttikas.16 It records the arguments and counter-arguments that must have transpired between 
Patañjali and his pupils about the contents of the vārttikas. Patañjali too approached the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī with his independent perspective about its derivational system, and skilfully wove 
Kātyāyana’s vārttikas into his own presentation of the Pāṇinian machine. In doing so, he both 
established his independent interpretation of Pāṇini’s and Kātyāyana’s metarules, and wrote 
new metarules to afford us greater clarity to the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational procedure.  
In the course of time, some Pāṇinīyas took it upon themselves to compile and comment on all 
such metarules from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They also came up with new metarules to fill the 
 
15 Cardona 1976: 267-268. 
16 The two major commentaries on the Mahābhāṣya are the Pradīpa of Kaiyaṭa and the Uddyota of 
Nāgeśa.

knowledge gaps that they thought existed in the tradition. They came to be known as 
paribhāṣākāras ‘authors of paribhāṣās’, and the literature composed by them, as paribhāṣā 
literature. Paribhāṣā texts have been written over many centuries – from around17 (or soon 
after) Patañjali’s time, if not before him, to the 18th century. Among the paribhāṣā texts of the 
Pāṇinian tradition, the most popularly studied, quoted and commented upon in modern times 
is the relatively recent Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, which was written in the 
eighteenth century.  
A rich tradition of paribhāṣā literature has long existed in other schools of Sanskrit grammar 
too (e.g., Kātantra, Haima, Cāndra).18 Both Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣākāras were 
especially interested in certain topics, for example, rule conflict. In Nāgeśa’s work, the section 
containing paribhāṣās 38 to 70 deals exclusively with rule conflict and is thus called 
bādhabīja.19 Similarly, in the Kātantra system, paribhāṣā sūtras are actually divided into 
balābala sūtras ‘metarules dealing with comparison of rule strength’ and others which do not 
deal with this topic.20 A significant exchange of ideas took place between Pāṇinian and non-
Pāṇinian traditions due to mutual borrowing of paribhāṣās. 
Circa 7th century AD, Jayāditya and Vāmana wrote the Kāśikā, which consists of vr̥ ttis on each 
rule.21 A vr̥ tti paraphrases the rule, teaches metarules that help us correctly apply that rule, 
gives examples of its application, and justifies the existence of each word of that rule. Vr̥ ttis 
borrow a significant proportion of their contents from Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya. They are unique 
in that they do not comprise new metarules, yet by quoting some metarules from Patañjali’s 
Mahābhāṣya and ignoring others, they present an evolved perspective about the mechanistic 
aspects of Pāṇinian derivations – often quite different from Patañjali’s. 
Lastly, let us talk about kaumudī texts, which explicitly envision the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a 
grammatical machine. The kaumudī tradition which began in the fifteenth century with 
 
17 Abhyankar 1967: 12.

Paribhāṣāsaṁgraha (1967).

of Haradatta.

Rāmacandra’s Prakriyākaumudī22, reorders the sūtras of the Aṣṭādhyāyī to reflect their 
derivational roles: in any Kaumudī text, a rule is introduced when the first derivation involving 
it is taught. The Kaumudī texts first introduce saṁjñā and paribhāṣā rules, then teach sandhi 
rules, then introduce nominal and verbal inflections in the order in which forms appear in 
paradigms, and then teach derivatives and compounds. The most celebrated text in this genre 
is Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s Siddhāntakaumudī written in the seventeenth century.23 By reordering the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī’s rules, the Kaumudī not only gives us a glimpse of how Pāṇini’s derivational 
mechanism actually works, but also tells us which metarules apply where, and how these 
metarules enable the us to perform derivations uniformly. 
Even though the traditional texts discussed above broadly agree on most derivational 
technicalities, they present different perspectives on the nature and characteristics of the 
machine.  
 
1.3 Modern Perspectives on the Functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī 
Before we explore how modern scholarship perceives the Aṣṭādhyāyī, let us very briefly 
consider what the tradition, and more specifically Kātyāyana and Patañjali say, about the 
meaning and purpose of vyākaraṇa. In vt. 14 of the Paspaśāhnika24, Kātyāyana says: 
lakṣyalakṣaṇe vyākaraṇam ‘grammar (stands for the combination of) lakṣya i.e., words (and 
sentences)’ and lakṣaṇa ‘rules’. This is true of any grammar, not just the Aṣṭādhyāyī. But does 
the Aṣṭādhyāyī have certain mechanistic properties which set it apart from conventional 
grammars? Below we will look at modern perspectives on this topic. According to Patañjali25, 
vyākaraṇa serves the following purposes: rakṣohāgamalaghvasandehāḥ “rakṣā ‘protection of 
the Vedas’, ūha ‘adapting inflected forms in Vedic mantras as required during rituals’, āgama 
 
22 The earliest reordered commentary was the Rūpāvatāra of Dharmakīrti (10th century), but its 
influence on the later kaumudī literature is uncertain.   
23 It is accompanied by Bhaṭṭojī’s auto-commentary on the Siddhāntakaumudī called 
Prauḍhamanoramā. Two commentaries on the Siddhāntakaumudī are widely used to study it, namely 
Vāsudeva Dīkṣita’s elaborate and beginner (lit. bāla ‘child’) -friendly Bālamanoramā, and Jñānendra 
Sarasvatī’s concise and advanced Tattvabodhinī (Cardona 1976: 285-286).

‘following Vedic injunctions’, laghu ‘brevity i.e., easy of learning the language’, and asandeha 
‘resolution of doubts’”. These certainly are some of the factors that must have motivated Pāṇini 
to write his grammar. But was Pāṇini also aiming to build a somewhat mechanistic model for 
deriving Sanskrit words (and subsequently, sentences)? Let us look at what modern scholarship 
tells us about topics like rule conflict and order of rule application in Pāṇinian derivations, and 
therefore, about the status of the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a ‘machine’. 
Let us start by looking at Bronkhorst’s work on this topic. Bronkhorst (2004) shows that 
Patañjali prefers a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, Patañjali believes that in order to 
decide which rule should apply at any step in a derivation, one need not know the outcomes of 
previous or following steps. He says, “It is clear from the above that Patañjali tries both to 
avoid looking back and looking ahead in explaining grammatical derivations.”26 Bronkhorst 
also 
points 
out 
that 
the 
Paribhāṣenduśekhara 
teaches 
the 
metarule 
pūrvaparanityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (paribhāṣā 38) ‘Of [these five kinds 
of rules, - viz.] a preceding [rule], a subsequent [rule]27, a nitya [rule]28, an antaraṅga [rule]29, 
and an apavāda [rule]30, - each following [rule] possesses greater force  [than any one of, or 
all, the rules which in this paribhāṣā are mentioned before it].’31 He concludes: “…(this)32 
clearly shows that, according to the traditional view, decisions concerning the continuation of 
 
26 Bronkhorst 2004: 37. 
27 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam ‘The rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins 
the rule conflict between two equally powerful rules.’  
28 Let us say that there is a conflict between rules A and B. A is called nitya with respect to B if A is 
applicable (both before and) after the application of B (cf. Pbh 117 kr̥ tākr̥ taprasaṅgī yo vidhiḥ sa nityaḥ, 
Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). B is called anitya with respect to A if B is applicable before, but not after the 
application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than, and defeats the anitya rule B. 
29Paribhāṣenduśekhara, 
describes 
antaraṅga 
as 
follows: 
antarmadhye 
bahiraṅgaśāstrīyanimittasamudāyamadhye’ ntarbhūtāny aṅgāni nimittāni yasya tad antaraṅgam. 
Kielhorn translates it as follows: ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application) of which lie within 
(or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. See Abhyankar’s reprint (second edition) of 
Kielhorn’s work (1960: 221-222). 
30 An apavāda ‘exception’ is stronger than, and thus defeats, the utsarga ‘general’ rule in case of 
conflict.

a grammatical derivation at any particular point are taken on the basis of the situation at hand. 
More specifically, no information about the earlier or later phases of the derivation is required 
to make a correct decision at any stage.”33 
Bronkhorst states that he is unconvinced by Patañjali’s evidence suggesting that the Aṣṭādhyāyī 
functions linearly. He thinks that Pāṇini did not intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be approached 
linearly, and attempts to establish that at least for some derivations, the knowledge of the 
derivation’s history and/or its future course is essential to select the right rule at a given step.34 
One of the reasons Bronkhorst thinks looking ahead into the derivation is required is to 
determine the order in which two rules should apply with respect to each other.35 Roodbergen 
has a different opinion on this subject. 36 He recommends some changes to the traditional order 
in which the following processes occur: the replacement of lakāras ‘tense and mood proxies’ 
with tiṄ ‘verbal endings’ and the introduction of vikaraṇas ‘affixes placed between verbal roots 
and lakāras/the endings that replace lakāras’. This shows that Roodbergen does believe in 
reading the Aṣṭādhyāyī linearly but disagrees to some extent with the tradition’s order of rule 
application.  And he thinks that this topic is not related to rule conflict and its resolution: ‘this 
ordering principle has nothing to do with a feeding relation between rules in which the 
application of one rule is made dependent on the effect of the application of another rule. It has 
nothing to do either, with the question of conflict of rules. To solve a conflict, other principles 
apply: paratva, siddha/asiddha37 and utsarga/apavāda.’ 
 
33 Bronkhorst 2004: 6. Patañjali says that para may mean iṣṭa ‘desirable’ in his commentary on 1.4.1 
(iṣṭavācī paraśabdaḥ. vipratiṣedhe paraṁ yad iṣṭaṁ tad bhavati; Mbh I.306.9-10). According to 
Bronkhorst, by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that he thinks should be applied’. I disagree with 
Bronkhorst’s interpretation. I think by iṣṭa, Patañjali means ‘the rule that should be applied so as to get 
the correct final form.’ This means that, in order to determine which rule is iṣṭa, one is required to know 
the final form. And to know the final form, one needs to look ahead into the derivation. So, in my 
opinion, this is an instance where Patañjali repudiates his linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.

37 A is siddha with respect to B if B recognizes the existence of A. Likewise, A is asiddha ‘not siddha’ 
with respect to B if B does not recognize the existence of A. 

17 
 
Scholars working on rule conflict have peripherally addressed the topic of linearity.  Cardona 
says that ‘the derivational prehistory of a form is pertinent to the operations which apply to 
it.’38 Joshi and Kiparsky think that it is important to look ahead into a derivation. They propose 
the extended siddha principle which they claim governs Pāṇinian derivations and which ‘scans 
entire candidate derivations…’39 thanks to its ‘global (trans-derivational) “lookahead” 
condition on derivations’40 ‘…and chooses the one in which siddha-relations (bleeding and 
feeding)41 are maximized’42. So, both Cardona and Joshi & Kiparsky, do not support an 
exclusively linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 
According to Houben43, ‘a comparison between Pāṇini’s grammar and “a machine” may be 
useful in demonstrating some of the features and procedures it incorporates, but the comparison 
has now and then been carried too far.’ He continues: ‘in fact, in the practice of Pāṇinīyas 
through the ages up to the present, no-one can ever have produced a correct form through 
Pāṇini’s system that was not already his starting point, or among his starting options … the 
system is therefore not well characterized as “synthetic”, even if synthetic procedures are 
central and most visible; rather the system is to be called “reconstitutive” - which implies the 
presence of a user, a preliminary statement, and the application of both analytic and synthetic 
procedures to the words in it … aiming at the best possible, saṁskr̥ ta form of his preliminary 
statement.’44 He attributes the reception of Pāṇinian grammar as a machine to Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita’s 
Siddhāntakaumudī and Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara: ‘in order to provide the desired solid 
authoritative basis to Sanskrit grammar it was moreover necessary to posit it as a closed system 
of rules and metarules – something it had never been in a true sense of this term for around two 
millennia, although Kātyāyana's and Patañjali's investigations on selected sūtras had prepared

before the application of A, is no longer applicable after the application of A. A feeds B, if B, which 
was not applicable before the application of A, becomes applicable after the application of A.

the ground for such an approach. The culmination in this trend came only a few generations 
later with Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa's Paribhāṣenduśekhara…’45 
Let us summarize what we have surveyed so far. Houben is not in favour of perceiving the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī as a derivational machine, thereby also implicitly dismissing both the concept of 
linearity and consistent conflict-resolution procedures. Roodbergen believes that the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī is a derivational machine, proposes his own version of a linear reading of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. Roodbergen also argues that the order of rule application and resolution of rule 
conflict are not related or associated with each other. Bronkhorst claims that the existence of 
paribhāṣā 38 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, which creates a hierarchy of conflict resolution 
tools (in addition to Patañjali’s statements), indicates that the tradition prefers a linear reading 
of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In doing so, Bronkhorst establishes a correlation between consistent rule 
conflict resolution procedures and a linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Bronkhorst rejects the 
linear approach. On the other hand, Joshi & Kiparsky and Cardona seem to think that their 
rejection of a strictly linear reading of the Aṣṭādhyāyī does not substantially undermine the 
mechanistic prowess of the Pāṇinian system, and devote much of their scholarly attention to 
solving rule conflict.  
While the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī remains the primary focus of this thesis, we shall also 
look at its interactions with the structure of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Let me first outline how the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī is structured. The rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī are organized on the basis of their 
purpose: rules teaching certain saṁjñās are grouped together, rules about a certain substitute 
are placed together and so on and so forth. In most such groups, the apavāda sūtras ‘exception 
rules’ are listed immediately after the utsarga sūtras ‘general rules’. These groups of rules are 
themselves placed in one of the eight books depending on their role: saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition 
rules’ and paribhāṣā sutras ‘metarules’ are generally placed in the first two adhyāyas, rules 
teaching affixation in the following three, and rules teaching morpho-phonological changes in 
the last three.  
The structure and organization of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, that is, the general arrangement and serial 
order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, have an influence on its functioning in different ways. In the 
opinion of the tradition, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam teaches that in the case of conflict 
between two equally powerful rules, the rule that appears later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order 
 
45 Houben 2015: 6. 

19 
 
wins, which implies that the serial order of rules in the Aṣṭādhyāyī has a direct impact on rule 
conflict resolution.  
Pāṇini has ingeniously composed three asiddha sections, headed respectively by 6.1.86 
ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ46, 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham. 6.4.22 teaches 
us that two rules treat each other as asiddhavat ‘as if suspended’ when both lie within 6.4.22-
12947, which helps avoid certain undesirable instances of rule conflict. 8.2.1 teaches us that 
from there onwards, a preceding rule treats any following rule as asiddha ‘suspended’, which 
helps facilitate or avoid the application of certain rules. Here too, the position of one rule with 
respect to other rules has a significant impact on Pāṇinian derivations or the functioning of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. 
Interestingly, the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī may have had an impact on its structure too. 
Roodbergen argues that ‘the word building process proceeds in what is visually a left-to-right 
direction’.48 According to Roodbergen, this direction of word-building which underlies the 
functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, impacts its structure, that is, the positioning of rules in different 
books and chapters of the Aṣṭādhyāyī: ‘rules dealing with left-side elements are introduced 
earlier [in earlier sections of the Aṣṭādhyāyī]49 than rules dealing with right-side elements’50.  
We have seen what the existing literature on the subject says about the functioning of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī and its connection with its structure. In this thesis, I share my research on rule 
interaction, and then go on to show how these findings shed light on the functioning of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. I conclude that Pāṇini did intend for the Aṣṭādhyāyī to be interpreted linearly and 
as a closed grammatical machine. Before I share my understanding of rule interaction, let us 
first look at the tradition’s views on this subject. 
 
 
46 A single replacement of the preceding and the following sounds is suspended (asiddha) with respect 
to rules teaching replacement with ṣ (ṣatva) and the introduction of augment tUK. 
47 According to the Kāśikā, and broadly, the tradition, the scope of 6.4.22 continues up to the end of 
6.4. I will discuss this in detail in chapter 5. 
48 Roodbergen 1991: 313.

Aṣṭādhyāyī poses a challenge to Roodbergen’s proposition.

1.4 The Traditional View on Rule Conflict 
As will be shown in chapter 6, the views of the tradition have gradually evolved on the topic 
of rule conflict. But here, I shall introduce the topic by outlining those ideas on rule conflict 
that today’s traditional scholars hold true. To achieve this, I will present the views of the Kāśikā 
and paribhāṣā texts on this topic. 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam is the only metarule in the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī which explicitly deals with rule conflict. Here is Vasu’s English translation of the 
rule 1.4.2 of the Aṣṭādhyāyī which is in keeping with the Kāśikā’s interpretation: ‘when rules 
of equal force prohibit each other, then the last in the order herein given is to take effect.’ 
On this rule, the Kāśikā says: 
virodho vipratiṣedhaḥ. yatra dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin yugapat prāpnutaḥ sa 
tulyabalavirodho 
vipratiṣedhaḥ. 
tasmin 
vipratiṣedhe 
paraṁ 
kāryaṁ 
bhavati. 
utsargāpavādanityānityāntaraṅgabahiraṅgeṣu tulyabalatā nāstīti nāyam asya yogasya 
viṣayaḥ, balavataiva tatra bhavitavyam. apravṛttau paryāyeṇa vā pravṛttau prāptāyāṁ 
vacanam ārabhyate.  
Here is my translation of this passage, which represents the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2: 
‘The word vipratiṣedha means “conflict”. When two operations which can be applied at other 
sites become simultaneously applicable at one [and the same site], this is called a conflict of 
equal strength or vipratiṣedha. In the event of vipratiṣedha, the rule that comes later [in the 
serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī] prevails.51 A general rule (utsarga) and its exception (apavāda),  
or a nitya rule and an anitya rule, or an antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga rule, are not rules of equal 
strength. These pairs do not fall under the jurisdiction of this rule. In these cases, the stronger 
rule wins. When both rules are unable to apply, or when they are only able to apply 
alternatively, this rule comes into play.’ 
Then the Kāśikā gives us an example: 
ato dīrgho yañi supi cety asyāvakāśaḥ. vṛkṣābhyāṁ plakṣābhyāṁ bahuvacane jhaly et ity 
asyāvakāśaḥ vṛkṣeṣu plakṣeṣu ihobhayaṁ prāpnoti. vṛkṣebhyaḥ plakṣebhyaḥ iti. paraṁ 
bhavati vipratiṣedhena. 
This is explained by Vasu as follows: 
 
51 I have translated para kārya as understood by the tradition. 

21 
 
‘As an example of rules of equal force, see 7.3.102 and 7.3.103. The first rule declares, when 
a case-affix beginning with a letter of yaÑ pratyāhāra follows, the long vowel is substituted 
for the final of an inflective base ending in a short a. As vr̥ kṣa + bhyām = vr̥ kṣābhyām. The 
next rule declares:- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or [sic]52 jhaL pratyāhāra 
follows, e is the substitute for the final a of an inflective base. As vr̥ kṣa + su = vr̥ kṣeṣu. But 
when the plural case-affix bhyas follows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter53 bha belongs 
both to pratyahāras yaÑ and jhaL. Are we to lengthen the short a or substitute e? The present 
sūtra gives the reply, e is to be substituted because 7.3.103 ordaining e follows next to 7.3.102. 
Thus vr̥ kṣa + bhyaḥ = vr̥ kṣebhyaḥ.’54 
The Kāśikā teaches us that when two conflicting rules are not of equal force, 1.4.2 is not 
applicable to the conflict between them. The paribhāṣā tradition throws light on conflicts 
between rules which are not of equal strength: 
a. Between a nitya and an anitya operation, a nitya rule is more powerful. 
Nityānityayor nityo vidhir balavān (Paribhāṣā 118, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha).55 
b. Between an antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga operation, an antaraṅga operation is more powerful. 
Antaraṅgabahiraṅgayor antaraṅgo vidhir balīyān (Paribhāṣā 115, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha).56 
c. Between an apavāda and an utsarga operation, an apavāda operation is more powerful. 
Utsargāpavādayor apavādavidhir balavān (Paribhāṣā 85, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra). 
The more powerful rule wins. The following paribhāṣā, which has been popularized by the 
Paribhāṣenduśekhara, creates a hierarchy of importance between four tools of rule conflict 
resolution namely paratva, nityatva, antaraṅgatva and apavādatva57: pūrva-para-nitya-
 
52 Of. 
53 Perhaps Vasu intended to say ‘sound’ and not ‘letter’. 
54 This example in the Kāśikā is borrowed from Mahābhāṣya on 1.4.2 (Mbh I.304.15).  
55 Another version of this paribhāṣā is balavan nityam anityāt (92, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra). 
56 Another version of this paribhāṣā is (balavad) antaraṅgaṁ bahiraṅgāt (93, Bhojaparibhāṣāsūtra), 
where balavat is anuvr̥ tta from the previous paribhāṣā. 
57 It is not clear why the word pūrva has been mentioned in the paribhāṣā.  

22 
 
antaraṅga-apavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (Pbh 38, Paribhāṣenduśekhara). We have 
already mentioned this paribhāṣā before. Below I will clarify its implications. 
Paribhāṣā 38 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara says that a para sūtra is stronger than a pūrva sūtra; 
a nitya sūtra is stronger than a para sūtra; an antaraṅga sūtra is stronger than a nitya sūtra; 
and an apavāda sūtra is stronger than an antaraṅga sūtra. In practical terms this translates into 
the following procedure. 
First try establishing the relationship taught in step a: 
a. apavāda>utsarga: an apavāda (exception) sūtra is more powerful than, and wins when 
competing with, an utsarga (general rule) sūtra. 
If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, try establishing the relationship taught 
in step b:  
b. antaraṅga>bahiraṅga58: an antaraṅga sūtra is more powerful than, and wins when 
competing with, a bahiraṅga sūtra. 
If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, try establishing the relationship taught 
in step c:  
c. nitya>anitya: a nitya rule is more powerful than and wins when competing with an anitya 
rule.  
If and only if this step does not yield the correct result, apply 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, 
which we call step d here:  
d. para>pūrva: a para sūtra (a later rule in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order) is more powerful 
than, and wins when competing with, a pūrva sūtra (which appears before the para sūtra). 
 
 
 
 
 
58 Patañjali and Nāgeśa hold the antaraṅga paribhāṣā true for both conflict and other situations. See 
the Mahābhāṣya on 1.4.2 (Mbh I.309.24 onwards) and paribhāṣā 50 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, 
asiddham bahiraṅgam antaraṅge. 

23 
 
Traditional solution: rule conflict 
 
                     unequal strength                                  equal strength (vipratiṣedha) 
 
                 stronger rule wins                                                the para rule wins (1.4.2) 
 
1.5 Analysis of the Traditional Perspective 
Let us look at 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam again. Pāṇini does not explain the meaning of 
vipratiṣedha in the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The Kāśikā claims that vipratiṣedha means tulyabalavirodha 
‘conflict between two equally powerful rules.’ This is a plausible assumption because, in 
Sanskrit literature, the term has been used to mean ‘the opposition of two courses of action 
which are equally important, the conflict of two even-matched interests’59. But which conflicts 
qualify as tulyabala ‘having equal strength’? The Kāśikā says that rule pairs which are not 
nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, apavāda-utsarga are tulyabala ‘having equal strength’.  
Let us try to understand why the tradition felt the need to come up with these tools. According 
to the tradition, para in 1.4.2 means ‘the rule that appears after another in the serial order of 
the Aṣṭādhyāyī’. Thus, in the case of a conflict (vipratiṣedha) between two rules, the operation 
prescribed by the later rule should prevail. However, if one assumes that any rule conflict can 
be called vipratiṣedha, and therefore applies 1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a 
conflict, in many cases one gets the wrong answer at the end of the derivation. Let us consider 
a few examples: tud is a 6th class root which can take both parasmaipada ‘active’ and 
ātmanepada ‘middle’ endings.  
When deriving its present third person singular form, two rules become applicable at the step 
tud + tiP. One is 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ guṇaḥ)60, 
which teaches that the penultimate light vowel iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) is replaced with guṇa (a, e, o) when 
followed by a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix. The other is 3.1.77 tudādibhyaḥ śaḥ 
(sārvadhātuke kartari), which teaches the addition of affix Śa after roots belonging to the class 
starting with tud in the Dhātupāṭha, when the root is followed by a sārvadhātuka affix in an 
 
59 See the entry on vipratiṣedha in Apte’s Sanskrit dictionary.  
60 The terms in brackets are anuvr̥ tta ‘continued’ from previous sūtras.  

24 
 
active construction. Note that, since 7.3.86 comes after 3.1.77 in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, according to the traditional understanding of 1.4.2 it should win, but applying 
7.3.86 would give the wrong answer: tod + tiP (7.3.86)  tod + Śa + tiP (3.1.77)  *todati.  
Notice that 3.1.77 is applicable after 7.3.86 applies, as seen in the derivation above. On the 
other hand, if 3.1.77 applies first, we get: tud + Śa + tiP. Since Śa is marked with a Ś, it is 
sārvadhātuka by 3.4.113 tiṅśit sārvadhātukam, and being a sārvadhātuka which is not marked 
with a P, it is treated as if marked by Ṅ by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit (ṅit). By 1.1.5 kṅiti ca (na 
iko guṇavr̥ ddhī), the guṇa replacement of u in tud by 7.3.86 is no longer possible. So 7.3.86 is 
not applicable once 3.1.77 has applied.  
Thus, 3.1.77 and 7.3.86 are nitya and anitya respectively. If the nitya rule, i.e., 3.1.77 wins, we 
get: tud + Śa + tiP (3.1.77)  tudati, which is the correct answer. In this example, relying on 
paratva gives the wrong answer, but using nityatva gives the right answer. We shall come back 
to this after we look at a few more examples.  
Consider the next example: to derive syona ‘a sack, something stitched’, na is added to siv ‘to 
sew, stitch’: siv + na (3.3.1 uṇādayo bahulam).61 First, by 6.4.1962 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca 
(kvijhaloḥ kṅiti), v of siv is replaced with ū: (siū) + na. Now, two rules are simultaneously 
applicable here: 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, which is caused by ū and prescribes the replacement of i 
with y, and 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which is caused by na and prescribes the 
replacement of i of si with its corresponding guṇa (i.e., e). Since 7.3.86 comes after 6.1.77 in 
the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, by 1.4.2 it should win. But applying 7.3.86 gives us the 
wrong answer. 
According to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the causes (of the application) 
of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga rule’. So, in the case of siū 
+ na, ū, the cause of 6.1.77, lies before (i.e., to the left of) na, the cause of 7.3.86. Thus, 6.1.77 
 
61 This is one of only two sūtras that refer to an ancillary text known as Uṇādisūtras, which provide for 
introducing certain affixes after verb roots to derive nominal bases (Cardona 1976: 170). There is no 
clear consensus about whether or not Pāṇini himself wrote the Uṇādisūtras (Cardona 1976: 174). I 
personally do not think he did, and so I do not consider this derivation ‘Pāṇinīya’. But because the 
commentarial tradition uses this as an example in the present context, I discuss it nonetheless. The 
relevant Uṇādi sūtra here is 289 siveṣ ṭer yū ca. 
62 I am aware that the tradition reads this rule as cchvoḥ… and not as chvoḥ…. However, I think that 
the original version must have been chvoḥ. See Kiparsky 1982: 89. 

25 
 
is antaraṅga whereas 7.3.86 is bahiraṅga. Using the antaraṅgatva tool, 6.1.77 wins. We get 
syū + na  syo + na (sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ)  syona, which is the correct answer. 
Relying on paratva gives the wrong answer, while using antaraṅgatva gives the right answer.  
Let us look at one more example. Two rules, namely 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) and 1.4.18 yaci 
bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) lie in the ekā saṁjñā section (1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā). 
1.4.1 teaches that up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, any item can take only one saṁjñā 
‘technical designation’. 1.4.16 siti ca (padam) teaches that an item is called pada when an affix 
marked with S follows, and 1.4.18 yaci bham (svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne) teaches that an item 
is called bha when a y- or vowel-initial, non-sarvanāmasthāna affix belonging to the class 
starting with sU follows. Consider the example ūrṇā + yuS.63 Here ūrṇā can potentially take 
two saṁjñās: pada by 1.4.16 and bha by 1.4.18. However, since both rules lie within the 
jurisdiction of 1.4.1, ūrṇā can take only one of the two saṁjñās. By 1.4.2, the para rule i.e., 
1.4.18 should win. But if ūrṇā takes the bha saṁjñā, then ā of ūrṇā gets deleted by 6.4.148 
yasyeti ca (bhasya lopaḥ taddhite), which teaches that the final i or a (both short and long) of 
an item which is termed bha are deleted when followed by an ī or a taddhita affix. This gives 
us the wrong taddhita stem *ūrṇyu. The Kāśikā says that 1.4.16 is an apavāda of 1.4.18 without 
justifying this claim.64 If the apavādatva tool is used, 1.4.16 wins, which gives the correct stem 
ūrṇāyu. Using paratva gives the wrong answer, while using apavādatva gives the right answer.  
In all three examples discussed above, using paratva gives the wrong answer, but using 
nityatva, antaraṅgatva and apavādatva respectively leads to the correct answer. Below, I 
present an abridged version of how I think the current method of solving rule conflict has 
gradually evolved. Having realized that treating all rule conflicts as vipratiṣedha and applying 
 
63 5.2.123 ūrṇāyā yus ‘The taddhita suffix yuS occurs to denote the sense of matUP after syntactically 
related nominal stem ūrṇā “wool”’. 
64 I agree with Cardona’s (1970: 46) explanation for this: “Consider now 1.4.16. There are only four 
affixes marked with S in Pāṇini’s grammar: ghaS ( iya by 7.1.2) introduced by 5.1.106, chaS ( īya, 
7.1.2) by 4.2.114-5, yaS (ya) by 5.2.138, and yuS ( aka, 7.1.1) by 5.2.123, 138, 140. For example, 
r̥ tviya- ‘tempestivus’ (<r̥ tu ‘appropriate time, season’) contains ghaS. All such affixes are taddhita 
(4.1.76: taddhitāḥ), included among the affixes referred to in 1.4.17-8, and all also begin with y or a 
vowel. Hence, items occurring before these are eligible for being bha by 1.4.18.” With the help of this 
information, we can infer that 1.4.18 is applicable wherever 1.4.16 is applicable, but 1.4.16 is not always 
applicable where 1.4.18 is. 1.4.16 is more specific than 1.4.18 and thus wins. 

26 
 
1.4.2 uniformly to every instance of such a conflict gives the wrong answer in many cases, the 
Pāṇinīyas:  
(1) claimed that they found jñāpakas ‘hints or clues’ in Pāṇini’s sūtras which authorised them 
to devise new tools like nityatva, antaraṅgatva, anavakāśatva, etc., for the purpose of solving 
rule conflicts; 
(2) restricted the jurisdiction of rule 1.4.2 by declaring that vipratiṣedha implies only tulyabala 
conflicts, i.e., conflicts between equally powerful rules; and 
(3) declared that rule pairs like nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga, and anavakāśa-sāvakāśa 
were to be called atulyabala ‘not equally powerful’.  
This allowed them to exclude the atulyabala rule pairs, namely nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-
bahiraṅga etc., from the jurisdiction of 1.4.2, thereby containing the problems caused by their 
interpretation of 1.4.2 to a smaller number of cases. Gradually, the Pāṇinīyas also constructed 
the hierarchy taught in paribhāṣā 38 of Paribhāṣenduśekhara above to determine which tool 
takes precedence over which other tools. 
However, these post-Pāṇinian tools are not without flaws, to compensate for which umpteen 
other paribhāṣās have been written by Pāṇinīyas. Many of these paribhāṣās address very 
specific cases65 or even single examples of conflict, thereby defeating the entire purpose of 
writing metarules, which is to arrive at broad generalizations that can govern the application of 
and interactions between the whole body of rules. And even after this, the Pāṇinīyas are not 
able to solve every case of conflict correctly: every time they falter, they find one tortuous 
explanation or the other to justify that ‘exception’.  
I do not think that all paribhāṣās taught by the Pāṇinīyas should be rejected. Many post-
Pāṇinian paribhāṣās accurately capture how the Pāṇinian machine functions, and thus they are 
of great importance to us. They are mostly descriptive in nature and make insightful 
observations about the Aṣṭādhyāyī. However, we also find post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās that teach 
us tools for rule conflict resolution, such as nityatva and antaraṅgatva, which Pāṇini would 
 
65 For example, consider Pbh 52 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, antaraṅgān api vidhīn bahiraṅgo lug 
bādhate ‘A bahiraṅga rule teaching LUK deletion defeats an antaraṅga rule [in case of conflict]’, which 
is an exception of Pbh 50 antaraṅge bahiraṅgam asiddham ‘An antaraṅga rule treats a bahiraṅga rule 
as suspended.’ 

27 
 
certainly not have left unstated if he actually wanted to teach them, and which impose post-
Pāṇinian ideas onto the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, the validity of this set of paribhāṣās is questionable. 
 
1.6 Modern Scholarship on 1.4.2  
The tradition thinks that 1.4.2 applies to tulyabala conflicts between any two rules of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. But many modern scholars, starting with Faddegon (1936), have tried to restrict 
the scope of 1.4.2 further, to include only those rules that lie between 1.4.2 and 2.2.38: they 
argue that since 1.4.2 lies within the ekā saṁjñā adhikāra (cf. 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā ‘up 
to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, each item can take only one saṁjñā’), the jurisdiction of 
1.4.2 too should be suspended at 2.2.38.66 Kiparsky comes up with his own justification for 
this interpretation, in which he argues that the alternate version of 1.4.1 mentioned by Patañjali 
is proof of the fact that 1.4.2 only governs rules between 1.4.2 and 2.2.38. Let us look at 
Patañjali’s commentary first, and then consider Kiparsky’s argument based on it. On 1.4.1, 
Patañjali suggests that Pāṇini has taught two different versions of 1.4.1 to his pupils: 
kathaṁ tv etat sūtram paṭhitavyam. kim ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñeti. āhosvit prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ 
kāryam iti. kutaḥ punar ayaṁ sandehaḥ. ubhayathā hy ācāryeṇa śiṣyāḥ sūtraṁ pratipāditāḥ. 
kecid ākaḍārād ekā saṁjñeti. kecit prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam iti. kaś cātra viśeṣaḥ. 
tatraikasaṁjñādhikāre tadvacanaṁ (vt. 2) 
tatraikasaṁjñādhikāre tadvaktavyam. kim. ekā saṁjñā bhavatīti. nanu ca yasyāpi 
paraṁkāryatvaṁ tenāpi paragrahaṇaṁ kartavyam. parārtham mama bhaviṣyati. vipratiṣedhe 
ca iti. mamāpi tarhy ekagrahaṇam parārthaṁ bhaviṣyati. sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau 
iti.67 
 
66 On this, Joshi (1998: 58) makes an interesting remark: ‘in his 1936 publication on Pāṇini’s grammar 
(p. 26-27) B. Faddegon casually notes that P. 1.4.2 is a paribhāṣā, and that it is valid up to the end of 
P. 2.2, as if there never had been any doubt. Compare further Cardona 1976, p. 190.’ 
67 Mbh I.296.11-18. 

28 
 
“But how should this rule be read? Is it ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā68 or prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ 
kāryam69? But how [does] this doubt [arise]? Because the students have been taught this rule 
in both ways by the teacher. Some [have been taught] ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā [and] some prāk 
kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam. And what is the difference [between these alternative readings] here? 
In that section where one name applies, the statement of that [must be made]. (vt. 2) 
In that section where one name applies, that should be stated. What [should be stated]? That 
only one saṁjñā applies [per item]. However, one who [believes that] the following rule 
[prevails] has to include the word para too. It will [serve] another [purpose] for me later [that 
is, by continuation, in] vipratiṣedhe ca. For me too then, the mention of eka will [serve] another 
[purpose], in sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau.70”71 
The two versions of the rule pair 1.4.1-2 are: 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe 
param kāryam; and 1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād param kāryam, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe ca. The former 
version is found in the available manuscripts of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, while the latter version is first 
mentioned by Patañjali himself. In the case of the latter, Patañjali only indirectly hints at what 
I have called 1.4.2, when explaining how he could use para from 1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād paraṁ 
 
68 Up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, each item can take only one saṁjñā. 
69 Up to 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ karmadhāraye, the rule that comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order 
prevails. 
70 In the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order, 1.2.64 sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau comes before 1.4.1 ā 
kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā. So, one may wonder how Patañjali would be able to continue ekā from 1.4.1 into 
1.2.64 by anuvr̥ tti. I want to clarify here that Patañjali is proposing to reorder the rules such that ā 
kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā comes before sarūpāṇām ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau, so that he may be able to continue 
ekā from the former into the latter by anuvr̥ tti. I do not see how doing this would be justified or useful. 
71 Note that there is no evidence that Kātyāyana was aware of these two versions. Vt. 2 
tatraikasaṁjñādikāre tadvacanaṁ (Mbh I.296.15) has been written in context of the first vārttika, and 
not in the context of these supposedly different versions of 1.4.1 (and 1.4.2). The first vārttika reads: 
anyatra saṁjñāsamāveśān niyamārthaṁ vacanam “Because names co-apply elsewhere, the statement 
is for the sake of making a restriction.” (Mbh I.296.3). And so, the second vārttika continues to discuss 
this topic:  tatraikasaṁjñādikāre tadvacanaṁ ‘In that section where one name applies, the statement of 
that [must be made].’ As is peculiar of Patañjali, he skilfully weaves Kātyāyana’s vārttikas into his own 
discourse. But it must be borne in mind that, as far as we know, the idea of two different versions of 
1.4.1 (and 1.4.2) is Patañjali’s alone.   

29 
 
kāryam later in the following rule (1.4.2) vipratiṣedhe ca through anuvr̥ tti72. It logically follows 
that its co-referent kāryam too would be continued into 1.4.2 along with paraṁ.  
1.4.1 prāk kaḍārād [paraṁ kāryam] 
1.4.2                                              vipratiṣedhe ca 
 
Original version 
Patañjali’s alternate version 
1.4.1 
ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā 
prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam 
1.4.2 
vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam 
vipratiṣedhe ca (paraṁ kāryam) 
 
Note that both versions of 1.4.1 apply only to the section between 1.4.1 and 2.2.38, whereas 
both versions of 1.4.2 apply to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. Besides, while the two versions of 1.4.1 
say different things (one says ekā saṁjñā and the other says paraṁ kāryam), the two versions 
of 1.4.2 essentially say the same thing. 
So, what does the alternative version of 1.4.1 i.e., prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam exactly mean? 
It translates as: between 1.4.1 and 2.2.38 the later rule should be applied. But when? In which 
context or situation? This version of 1.4.1 is at best ambiguous. Secondly, it seems very 
unlikely that Pāṇini would teach two different versions of his own rules to his pupils. In the 
following chapter, I reinterpret the meaning of para, which makes it clear that the alternate 
version of 1.4.1 does not make sense. For all these reasons, I conclusively reject the alternate 
version.  
On the other hand, Kiparsky assumes that the alternate version is the correct one, and uses this 
assumption to argue for restricting the scope of 1.4.2 to the section up to 2.2.38. He says, “A 
very suggestive piece of evidence that the domain of 1.4.2 is limited to 1.4-2.2 is that Patañjali 
actually records a variant reading of Pāṇini’s rules in which that must be the interpretation. In 
discussing 1.4.1 Patañjali says, ‘How then is this rule to be read: as ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā “up 
to kaḍāra (2.2.38) (everything gets only) one technical term” or as prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam 
“up to kaḍāra apply the last”? Why is this an issue? Because the teacher [Pāṇini] had his 
students recite both ways, some of the ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā, others prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ 
 
72 The presence of the word ca in 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe ca hints at the fact that some words would become 
anuvr̥ tta from 1.4.1 into 1.4.2. 

30 
 
kāryam. Thus, these were still two versions of the rules in Patañjali’s time. Not surprisingly, 
the version in which the domain of the para relation could be extended over the whole grammar 
eventually won out. But it seems reasonable to assume that the version in which the domain 
obviously has to be limited to 1.4 to 2.2 has a greater claim to authenticity.’73 
In his analysis, Kiparsky conveniently ignores the part where Patañjali talks about 1.4.2 
vipratiṣedhe ca (param kāryam). If 1.4.1 is prāk kaḍārāt paraṁ kāryam, 1.4.2 would be 
vipratiṣedhe ca (param kāryam), as mentioned by Patañjali himself. Thus, the para relation 
would still be applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī even if we accept the alternate version of 
1.4.1-2 as being the actual or correct one. So, I conclude that contrary to Kiparsky’s claim, both 
versions of the pair (1.4.1-2) allow the para relation to extend to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, 
his speculation about why the ekā saṁjñā version won out does not pass muster, and the 
argument that paraṁ kāryam does not hold beyond 2.2.38 too remains unsubstantiated. 
Now going back to the general argument that 1.4.2 does not apply beyond 2.2.38, Faddegon 
and others reduced the scope of 1.4.2 with the objective of avoiding the application of 1.4.2 to 
those cases of conflict wherein applying 1.4.2 may give the wrong answer. But we have already 
seen in the derivation of ūrṇāyu that even within 1.4.1-2.2.38, the pūrva rule 1.4.16 siti ca 
prevails over the para rule 1.4.18 yaci bham. In other words, even within 1.4.1-2.2.38, 1.4.2 
does not give the right answer.   
Besides, those conflicts which we come across in 1.4.2-2.2.38, which are essentially conflicts 
between saṁjñā rules, can be successfully solved by choosing the specific rule (the exception) 
over the general one, thereby rendering Faddegon’s restriction of 1.4.2’s scope redundant 
anyway.74 For example, 1.4.16 siti ca, as we have seen above, is more specific than and 
therefore an exception of 1.4.18 yaci bham. Thus 1.4.16 wins. Similarly, 1.4.11 saṁyoge guru 
(which teaches that a short vowel is called guru ‘heavy’ when followed by a consonantal 
conjunct) is more specific than 1.4.10 hrasvaṁ laghu (which teaches that a short vowel is called 
laghu ‘light’). Thus, 1.4.11 wins.  
 
73 Kiparsky 1982: 114. 
74 While Joshi (1998: 45)’s overall view on this topic is very different from mine, he makes some 
observations which resonate with my findings: “the tradition in general is wrong…in thinking that 
apavādatva cannot take care of the designations introduced in the ekā saṁjñā section”.  

31 
 
In the same way, 1.4.100 taṅānāv ātmanepadam (which teaches that taṄ, ŚānaC and KānaC, 
which replace la, take the ātmanepada saṁjñā) is more specific than and thus defeats 1.4.99 
laḥ parasmaipadam (which teaches that the affixes which replace la take the parasmaipada 
saṁjñā’). Similarly, 1.4.46 adhiśīṅsthāsāṁ karma (which teaches that a kāraka which 
constitutes the locus of the action is called karma with the verbs śīṄ ‘to lie down’, sthā ‘to 
stand’, and ās ‘to sit’ occurring with preverb adhi) is more specific than and thus wins against 
1.4.45 ādhāro’dhikaraṇam (which teaches that a kāraka which constitutes the locus of the 
action is called adhikaraṇa).75 These examples satisfactorily prove that the apavāda tool is 
sufficient to identify the winning rule in the section 1.4.1-2.2.38. 
Secondly, restricting the scope of 1.4.2 to 1.4.1-2.2.38 implies that Pāṇini has given us no 
instructions about the conflicts that lie beyond 2.2.38, which I think is a highly unlikely 
scenario. In any case, the few attempts that have been made to deal with conflicts beyond 2.2.38 
by scholars such as Cardona (1970) and Joshi and Kiparsky (1979) address only certain types 
of rule conflict and fail to paint an overarching picture.76 
 
1.7 My Opinion 
In my view, firstly, Pāṇini did not expect us to create the categories ‘tulyabala’ and 
‘atulyabala’. Secondly, I think that he taught 1.4.2 as a metarule which, rather than being 
restricted to a particular section of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, is applicable to the entire Aṣṭādhyāyī. 
More broadly, I do not agree with both the traditional and the modern perspectives towards this 
topic, because instead of trying to decipher the actual meaning of 1.4.2, these approaches try 
to brush 1.4.2 under the carpet, to make it less effective or to weaken its impact. One does it 
 
75 Besides, there are some cases which may appear to be conflicts between rules teaching kāraka 
saṁjñās but which, according to me, are not conflicts at all. For example, whether one says geham 
praviśati (cf. 1.4.49 kartur īpsitatamaṁ karma  2.3.2 karmaṇi dvitīyā) or gehe praviśati (cf. 1.4.45 
ādhāro’dhikaraṇam  2.3.36 saptamy adhikaraṇe ca) depends entirely on the non-linguistic feature 
that the speaker wishes to express - that is, whether he/she wants to express kartur īpsitatama or ādhāra. 
So, this choice lies outside the domain of Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī. In conclusion, in my opinion, rule 
conflict does not arise between 1.4.45 and 1.4.49.  
76 We shall look at limited blocking (Cardona) in chapter 4 and siddha principle (Joshi and Kiparsky) 
in Appendix E. 

32 
 
by excluding certain rule pairs from the scope of vipratiṣedha, and the other by reducing the 
jurisdiction of 1.4.2. This approach which seeks to undervalue Pāṇini’s rule interaction 
mechanism and replaces it with self-invented methods of ‘rule conflict resolution’ can lead to 
some success for a limited set or specific type of examples, but does not allow us to understand 
and appreciate the larger picture.  
To get instructions about dealing with rule interaction, I try to rely, as much as possible, upon 
‘internal metarules’, that is, those metarules which Pāṇini has taught in his work, setting aside 
any ‘external metarules’, that is, those metarules that are not found in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, such as 
nityatva, antaraṅgatva, post-Pāṇinian paribhāṣās from the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, vārttikas 
that discuss rule interaction etc. In this thesis, I have come up with my own interpretation of 
1.4.2 and, using that, I have reinterpreted Pāṇini’s derivational mechanism. I have attempted 
to show that Pāṇini’s grammatical machine is self-sufficient, that is, its own (internal) 
metarules, are able to run it with remarkable perfection, and that no external metarules are able 
or required to aid this process.    
 

33 
 
Chapter Two 
2.1 Two Types of Operational Rule Interaction           
In the previous chapter, I have discussed how the tradition has misinterpreted 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe 
paraṁ kāryam. In this section, I lay the conceptual foundation that will help us understand the 
actual meaning of 1.4.2 in the next section (2.2).  
Over a period of time, I studied different examples in which two vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’ 
are simultaneously applicable at the same step of a derivation, from both traditional sources 
and modern literature. Henceforth, we will refer to such interaction between two 
simultaneously applicable operational rules as ‘Same-Step Rule Interaction’, or simply SSRI. 
I tried to divide these examples into different groups on the basis of the similarities between 
them.   
In my opinion, at any step in a derivation, even though two (or more) rules are applicable, only 
one rule applies. So, I attempted to determine if, of the two competing rules, a certain kind of 
rule always prevails over the other rule, in all the examples of that group. In other words, I 
came up with one generalization per group about the result of such competition between rules. 
The generalization that I made for one particular group of rules immediately caught my 
attention. In order to highlight the common property that binds together the examples of this 
group, first, I need to explain certain concepts, which I will do in this section. In section 2.2, I 
will discuss the said group of examples, and how this group of examples led me to discover the 
actual meaning of 1.4.2.   
Consider the two types of SSRI: 
 
Type 1:                                                       A       +       B 
 
                                                       R1A                      R2A 
Type 2:                                                     A       +       B 
 
  RA               RB 
 

34 
 
We will call Type 1 Same Operand Interaction - henceforth SOI - because both rules R1A and 
R2A are applicable to the same operand A at the same step. We will call Type 2 Different 
Operand Interaction - henceforth DOI - because the two rules RA and RB are applicable to two 
different operands A and B respectively at the same step.  
In their efforts to understand the meaning of 1.4.2, both traditional and modern scholars have 
failed to make good use of this clear distinction between SOI and DOI.1 Going further, we will 
see that this distinction plays a critical role in helping us understand Pāṇini’s key rule 1.4.2 
and, consequently, the entire derivational system of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.  
As stated before, in my opinion, at any step in a derivation, even though two (or more) rules 
are applicable, only one rule applies. So, for both Type 1 and Type 2, we need to determine 
which of the two rules should be applied at the given step.  
 
2.2 Solutions for Type 1 (SOI) and Type 2 (DOI) 
                                                                  A       +       B 
 
                                                     R1A                      R2A 
Which one of the two rules R1A and R2A should we apply at this step? Pāṇini does not give us 
any explicit instructions about solving SOI. In my view, if two rules are applicable 
simultaneously to the same operand, the rule that is more specific, which we may call ‘the 
special or exception rule’, wins. Note that this is similar to the traditional notion that an 
apavāda ‘exception’ rule defeats an utsarga ‘general’ rule.  
It is likely that Pāṇini did not deem it necessary to state explicitly that the exception rule defeats 
the general rule in case of SOI because the general-exception framework is not a feature of 
‘grammar’ alone but more broadly, a feature of the sūtra style itself. Freschi and Pontillo (2013: 
2) point out that “the basic framework of Sanskrit śāstras ‘systematic treatises’ is based on the 
practical and effective opposition between general and specific rules”.  
 
1 Cardona (1970: 48) does recognize this distinction: “the general condition for vipratiṣedha is, as 
noted…that two rules tentatively apply to provide operations which cannot possibly take place 
concurrently. The two operations can involve (a) a single operand or (b) different operands.” But he 
does not develop this intuition, relying instead on the traditional approach to rule interaction.

Note that the traditional approach is different from mine because: 
(i) The tradition does not draw a clear distinction between SOI and DOI. 
(ii) The tradition often ends up using tools other than utsarga-apavāda to resolve SOI.  
(iii) The tradition has not developed a systematic procedure to determine which of the two rules 
involved in SOI is more specific.  
I will develop such a procedure later in this chapter. Now, let us look at DOI. 
A       +       B 
 
RA             RB 
The group of examples referred to in section 2.1 are those that involve DOI. I noticed that in 
the case of DOI, if we pick the right-hand side (henceforth, RHS) operation, that is, application 
of rule RB to its operand B, over the left-hand side (henceforth, LHS) operation, that is, the 
application of rule RA to operand A, we always get the correct answer. This led me to realize 
the meaning of para in 1.4.2: para stands for the RHS operation. And thus, vipratiṣedha 
‘mutual opposition’ in 1.4.2 stands for DOI. I think it is apt to refer to DOI as vipratiṣedha 
‘mutual opposition’ because only one of the two operations wins, so in that sense, the two 
operations oppose each other. In sum, 1.4.2 means: ‘in the event of DOI (mutual opposition 
between the two operations), the RHS operation wins.’  
Note that even though in the previous chapter I frequently used the phrase ‘rule conflict’ - 
which has acquired a very specific connotation in modern Pāṇinian scholarship - to discuss the 
traditional and modern interpretations of 1.4.2, I have not used this phrase in the context of my 
own interpretation of 1.4.2. I interpret vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’ as ‘DOI’ and not as 
‘rule conflict’. DOI and rule conflict are different concepts. I will discuss this topic in detail 
later in this chapter. 
 
2.3 Evidence for My Interpretation of Para 
Before going further, let me provide more evidence to support my interpretation of para. The 
meaning of para in 1.4.2 can be confirmed by looking at the meaning of para in the rest of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. The term para has been used by Pāṇini on many occasions. Its occurrences can be 
classified into two groups: 

36 
 
Group A: 1.1.34, 1.4.109, 3.2.39, 3.3.138, 3.4.20, 4.3.5, 5.2.92, 5.3.29, 6.3.8.2 
Group B: 1.1.47, 1.1.51, 1.1.54, 1.1.57, 1.1.70, 1.2.40, 1.4.2, 1.4.62, 1.4.81, 2.1.2, 2.2.31, 
2.4.26, 3.1.2, 6.1.84, 6.1.94, 6.1.112, 6.1.115, 6.1.120, 6.2.199, 6.4.156, 7.3.22, 7.3.27, 7.4.80, 
7.4.88, 7.4.93, 8.1.2, 8.1.56, 8.2.92, 8.3.4, 8.3.6, 8.3.26, 8.3.27, 8.3.35, 8.3.87, 8.3.110, 8.3.118, 
8.4.283, 8.4.58.4 
Let us consider an example from Group A. 1.1.34 pūrvaparāvaradakṣiṇottarāparādharāṇi 
vyavasthāyām asaṁjñāyām (vibhāṣā jasi sarvanāmāni) teaches that the terms pūrva, para etc. 
are called sarvanāma optionally when followed by Jas. In 1.1.34 and in the other rules 
belonging to Group A, para is used as an ordinary word of the object language Sanskrit. In 
these rules, it does not have any special technical connotation with respect to Pāṇini’s 
derivational system. We are not interested in Group A, because 1.4.2 belongs to group B. 
Let us consider some examples from Group B. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ teaches that an item 
marked with anubandha M is placed after, i.e., to the right-hand side of, the last vowel of the 
item to which it is added. 1.1.51 ur aṇ raparaḥ teaches that r is added after, i.e., to the right 
side of the vowels a, i, u when they are substitutes of r̥ . 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya teaches that a 
substitute taught for the following or right-hand side item replaces its first sound. From these 
examples, it becomes clear that in the rules I have listed under group B, para is used to mean 
‘right-hand side’ in the context of Pāṇinian derivations.  
Furthermore, we also see that in the Aṣṭādhyāyī the term pūrva, the antonym of para, when 
used specifically in the context of Pāṇinian derivations, means LHS. For example, consider the 
pair of rules 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya and 1.1.67 tasmād ity uttarasya. 1.1.66 teaches 
that when an item is taught (nirdiṣṭe) in the locative (tasminn iti), it means that the item to its 
left-hand side (pūrvasya) undergoes an operation, and 1.1.67 teaches that, when an item is 
 
2 Since our focus is not on this group, I have not listed certain rules in which we find compounds or 
secondary derivatives containing para. Examples include parasmaipada, parokṣa, aparokṣa, parovara, 
parama, and paraspara. 
3 The original rule is upasargād anotparaḥ, but Patañjali has suggested that it should be read as 
upasargād bahulam. We find the latter version in many recensions.  
4 See Appendix F for the list of sūtras. 

37 
 
taught in the ablative (tasmād iti), it means that the item to its right-hand side (uttarasya)5 
undergoes the operation6.  
Let us confirm this by considering some rules which contain both pūrva and para. 6.1.84 ekaḥ 
pūrvaparayoḥ teaches that (in the following rules) a single sound replaces both the LHS sound 
and the RHS sound in case of saṁhitā ‘immediate proximity’. Similarly, 1.1.57 acaḥ parasmin 
pūrvavidhau teaches that a substitute for a vowel, if it is conditioned by an RHS context, is 
treated like its substituendum with respect to an operation on an LHS element. 
Besides, the word kāryam in 1.4.2 also gives us some crucial information. We know that in the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, Pāṇini does not generally use finite verbal forms in his rules. For example, in 
6.1.77, he does not say iko yaṇ aci bhavati / kāryam, but simply iko yaṇ aci. So, in the case of 
1.4.2 too, we can safely interpret kāryam as a noun rather than interpreting it as an optative 
passive participle meaning ‘should be done’. What does the noun kārya generally mean? It 
means ‘operation’, not ‘rule’. If Pāṇini wanted to say what the tradition interprets him as saying, 
I think he would have simply said vipratiṣedhe paraṁ sūtram and not vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam. All this corroborates my interpretation of para in 1.4.2.   
Let me summarize this topic now. In ordinary speech, para means ‘following, something that 
lies after’. Accordingly, in 1.4.2, para actually means ‘that which comes after’ in the left-to-
right sense in the context of derivations. However, the tradition took it as ‘that which comes 
after’ in the top (first)-to-bottom (last) or beginning-to-end sense in the context of the serial 
order of rules. And so, while para in 1.4.2 refers to the operand or operation that lies after, or 
on the right-hand side relative to another operand or operation, the tradition misunderstood it 
as the rule which comes after the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī.  
This leads to an important question: if traditional scholars interpreted para as ‘RHS 
item/operation’ in so many metarules as shown above, why did they interpret it as ‘the 
following rule’ in 1.4.2?7 I think this misunderstanding possibly arose because another 
 
5 Here uttara is a synonym of para. 
6 These are the traditional interpretations of these two rules. I discuss my interpretations of them in 
Appendix B.  
7 While I will discuss this in detail in chapter 6, I must mention here that Kātyāyana mentions that para 
in 1.4.2 could mean ‘RHS’ in vt. 12 on 6.1.158 anudāttaṁ padam ekavarjam. He says: 
śāstraparavipratiṣedhāniyamād vā śabdaparavipratiṣedhāt siddham ‘[in the event of vipratiṣedha 
between two operations] because it has not been [explicitly] mandated that paratva of rules [alone 

38 
 
metarule, 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham, uses pūrva, the opposite of para, to mean ‘preceding rule’. 
8.2.1 teaches that from 8.2.1 onwards, a preceding rule treats a following rule as suspended. 
This may have led Kātyāyana, the first scholar to comment upon Pāṇini’s sūtras, to think that, 
in sūtras dealing with relationships between rules such as 8.2.1 and 1.4.2, pūrva and para mean 
preceding rule and following rule respectively. However, upon closer examination, one realizes 
that when Pāṇini wants to indicate that he is referring to the relationship between preceding 
and following rules rather than operands, he adds the affix traL8 to the base: he says pūrva-tra 
in 8.2.1.9 This topic deserves our meticulous attention, and we will discuss it in greater detail 
in chapter 5. Here is the summary of my comprehensive solution: 
 
 Same Step Rule Interaction (SSRI)10 
 
                        
                 Type 1 (SOI)                                      Type 2 (DOI = vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’) 
 
                                                
          the exception rule wins                                                      RHS (para) operation wins 
 
2.4 A Key Difference Between SOI and DOI 
SOI and DOI have one prominent feature in common: in case of both SOI and DOI, two (or 
more) rules are simultaneously applicable at a certain step of the derivation. However, it is 
important to shed light on a key difference between SOI and DOI. This difference between SOI 
and DOI pertains to whether or not they involve competition between two operands.  
 
 
 
should be used to resolve] vipratiṣedha, alternatively paratva of sounds [may also be used to] 
accomplish [the task of resolving] vipratiṣedha’ (Mbh III.100.12). 
8 5.3.10 saptamyās tral. 
9 Pūrvatra stands for ‘with respect to a rule which comes earlier in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’.  
10 As stated before, by ‘rule’, here I specifically mean vidhi sūtra ‘operational rule’.  

39 
 
Type 1 (SOI) 
Type 2 (DOI) 
                        
                         A       +       B 
 
                                                      
            R1A                      R2A 
   
  
 
        A       +       B 
 
   
                       RA             RB 
 
 
In case of DOI, we see that the two simultaneously applicable rules RA and RB compete for the 
sole position of the rule that applies at that step. But the two operands A and B too compete for 
the sole position of the operand that undergoes an operation at that step.   
In case of SOI, the two simultaneously applicable rules R1A and R2A compete for the sole 
position of the rule that applies at that step. However, since both are applicable to the same 
operand A, we do not observe any competition between operands. 
Because Pāṇini has not given any instructions about SOI, but has taught the metarule 1.4.2 for 
dealing with DOI, we can say that Pāṇini has given explicit instructions about how we must 
deal with competition between operands (which we see in DOI but not in SOI), but not about 
how we must deal with competition between rules (which we see in both DOI and SOI).  
Thus, we must understand vipratiṣedha in 1.4.2 not as mutual opposition between rules but 
rather as mutual opposition between operands. 
 
2.5 Pāṇinian and Post-Pāṇinian Approaches to Derivations 
In order to determine why post-Pāṇinian (both traditional and modern) scholars have 
misinterpreted Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2, we need to understand that there is a fundamental difference 
between what I think are Pāṇinian11 and post-Pāṇinian conceptions of, or perspectives towards, 
the derivational procedure itself. I will explain exactly what I mean by this statement by means 
of examining six representative examples of SSRI from both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian 
perspectives below.  
Let us start with the latter. But before we examine these representative examples from the post-
Pāṇinian perspective, let me explain certain fundamental concepts which will help us 
 
11 When I make the distinction between Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian approaches in the following pages, 
it must be understood that by ‘Pāṇinian approach’, I mean ‘my interpretation of the Pāṇinian approach’. 

40 
 
understand this perspective better. Let us divide SSRI into two categories, namely ‘conflict’ 
and ‘non-conflict’. In order to define conflict and non-conflict, we must first define blocking. 
Let us say that two rules X and Y are simultaneously applicable at step K12. We say that rule 
X blocks rule Y if Y will not be applicable at the following step (K+1) after the hypothetical 
application of X at the present step (K). Conflict is defined as an SSRI which involves some 
blocking. Non-conflict is defined as an SSRI which does not involve any blocking. 
 
SSRI 
 
 
                              blocking                                                            no blocking 
 
 
                               conflict                                                              non-conflict 
 
Note that, in my opinion, Pāṇini has not defined or discussed the categories ‘conflict’ and ‘non-
conflict’ in any way whatsoever, and he does not expect us to know about or use them either. 
Traditional scholars too have not made an explicit distinction between conflict and non-
conflict. In modern / western scholarship, the concept of ‘(rule) conflict’ has been widely used, 
but ‘non-conflict’ has not been used at all.  
Then, the question arises: why have I made this distinction between conflict and non-conflict? 
I have done this to highlight that, for the most part, post-Pāṇinian scholarship has focused on 
conflict and has not paid much attention to non-conflict. Why is this the case? To answer this 
question, let us look closely at non-conflict, wherein the two rules X and Y do not block each 
other: if X applies at the present step, then Y is applicable at the following step, and if Y applies 
at the present step, then X is applicable at the following step. Before we go further, note that 
‘being applicable’ is different from ‘applying’. Consider the following situation: 
 
 
 
12 In other words, let us say that there is an SSRI between X and Y. 

41 
 
Step 1:                                                                    g                   h 
 
                                                                              X                   Y 
Let us say Y applies at this step, changing h to h*. Now, at the following step, not only X but 
another rule Z too becomes applicable: 
Step 2:                                                                    g                   h* 
 
                                                                               X                  Z 
Suppose that Z, and not X, applies at step 2.  
Here, we see that, if Y applies at step 1, X is applicable at the step 2.13 However, X does not 
apply at the step 2. This is the difference between ‘being applicable’ and ‘applying’. 
Now, let us go back to our conversation about why post-Pāṇinian scholarship does not take 
much interest in non-conflict. In most cases of non-conflict, if X applies at the present step, 
then Y is not only applicable but also applies at the following step. Similarly, if Y applies at 
the present step, then X is not only applicable but also applies at the following step. Thus, 
regardless of the order in which the two rules apply, one gets the correct form at the end of the 
derivation. This explains why the tradition can afford to overlook such examples of non-
conflict, which, as I said, constitute a huge majority of the set of all non-conflict examples.  
However, there is a minority of examples of non-conflict wherein if Y applies at the present 
step, X is applicable at the following step, but does not end up applying at the following step. 
The tradition does take some interest in such examples of non-conflict, which constitute a very 
tiny minority of the set of all non-conflict examples. 
Having defined both blocking and conflict, now let us look at how post-Pāṇinian scholarship 
views the following representative examples: 
 
 
 
 
 
13 So, going by the definition of blocking, Y does not block X. 

42 
 
1)  
k       +       l 
 
                                                      W                  R 
If we apply R at this step, W will be applicable at the following step. R does not block W. 
If we apply W at this step, R will not be applicable at the following step. W blocks R. 
We call this a case of asymmetrical or unidirectional blocking. Since this interaction involves 
blocking, this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 
 2)  
m      +      n 
  
                                                      S                  V 
If we apply S at this step, V will not be applicable at the following step. S blocks V.  
If we apply V at this step, S will not be applicable at the following step. V blocks S. 
We call this a case of symmetrical or mutual blocking. Since this interaction involves blocking, 
this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 
3)  
e      +      f 
 
                                                                  P              Y 
If we apply P at this step, Y will be applicable at the following step. P does not block Y. 
If we apply Y at this step, P will not be applicable at the following step. Y blocks P. 
We call this a case of asymmetrical or unidirectional blocking. Since this interaction involves 
blocking, this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 
4)  
g      +      h 
 
                                                                  Q              X 
If we apply Q at this step, X will not be applicable at the following step. Q blocks X.  
If we apply X at this step, Q will not be applicable at the following step. X blocks Q. 
We call this a case of symmetrical or mutual blocking. Since this interaction involves blocking, 
this is a case of conflict. Such examples are of interest to post-Pāṇinian scholars. 

43 
 
Post-Pāṇinian scholars are very interested in these four representative examples (REs). But one 
may ask: what about the remaining two REs? Let us look at them. 
5)  
i       +       j 
 
                                                      U                  T 
If we apply T at this step, U will be applicable at the following step. T does not block U. 
If we apply U at this step, T will be applicable at the following step. U does not block T. 
There is no blocking, so this is a case of non-conflict. The tradition does not think about or pay 
much heed to this kind of situation, for the most part.  
6)  
 c      +      d 
 
                                                                  O             Z      
If we apply O at this step, Z will be applicable at the following step. O does not block Z. 
If we apply Z at this step, O will be applicable at the following step. Z does not block O. 
There is no blocking, so this is a case of non-conflict. The tradition does not think about or pay 
much heed to this kind of situation, for the most part. 
Let us now summarize the relationship between blocking and conflict. 
No blocking 
Non-Conflict 
Unidirectional blocking 
Conflict 
Mutual blocking 
Conflict 
 
Before we continue discussing these six examples from the post-Pāṇinian perspective, let us 
consider the Pāṇinian perspective on them: 
 
 
 
 
 

44 
 
1)  
k       +       l 
 
                                                      W                  R 
This is a case of SOI. Let us say W is more specific. Thus, W wins. 
2)  
m      +      n 
 
                                                      S                  V 
This is a case of SOI. Let us say V is more specific. Thus, V wins.  
3)  
e      +      f 
 
                                                                  P              Y 
This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule Y wins.  
4)  
g      +      h 
 
                                                                  Q              X 
This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule X wins.   
5)  
i       +       j 
 
                                                      U                 T 
This is a case of SOI. Let us say U is more specific. Thus, U wins. 
6)  
 c      +      d 
 
                                                                  O             Z      
This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule Z wins.   
Note that in all six representative examples discussed here, Pāṇini does not require us to worry 
about what happens to the losing rule, for instance, P, in example 3: we need not be concerned 
about whether or not P is applicable at the following step, or whether or not P actually applies 
at the following step. In other words, Pāṇini does not use concepts like blocking and conflict 
to give instructions about dealing with SOI and DOI. 

45 
 
Even though Pāṇini does not use concepts like ‘conflict’ to give instructions about SSRI, and 
even though the tradition makes no explicit distinction between SOI and DOI, let us discuss 
both Pāṇinian and post-Pāṇinian concepts under one umbrella to understand this topic better. I 
have included both SOI and DOI examples because Pāṇini deals with them separately and have 
included examples of both conflict and non-conflict because the post-Pāṇinian approach 
subconsciously makes this distinction by focusing on conflict alone. Here is a summary of the 
examples: 
RE14

Representative examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 are of significant interest to post-Pāṇinian scholarship 
because they involve some kind of blocking, thereby constituting cases of conflict.

Now let us look at how the tradition solves examples of conflict. As stated in the previous 
chapter, traditional scholars tried to use their interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later 
in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins the conflict) to resolve such conflicts. This often gave 
them the wrong answer, so in order to reduce the challenges posed by their interpretation of 
1.4.2, they significantly reduced the scope of applicability of 1.4.2. 
They achieved this by restricting the meaning of vipratiṣedha to tulyabalavirodha ‘conflicts 
between rules of equal strength’. So, 1.4.2 does not apply to pairs of conflicting rules if the two 
rules are not of equal strength. In the case of such pairs of unequal strength, the rule which is 
 
14 RE = ‘Representative Example’. 
15 Only a minority of cases of SOI involve unidirectional blocking. Most cases of SOI involve mutual 
blocking.  

46 
 
stronger than the other wins. The tradition has come up with certain methods to identify these 
pairs of unequal strength. While we have already looked at some of them in the previous 
chapter, I will briefly discuss them below to outline which tool is used to deal with what kind 
of interaction (SOI / DOI) and what kind of blocking (unidirectional / mutual).16 
1. nitya > anitya: in a conflict between two rules A and B, A is called nitya with respect to B 
if A is applicable (both before and) after the application of B. B is called anitya with respect to 
A if B is applicable before but not after the application of A. The nitya rule A is stronger than 
and defeats the anitya rule B. In other words, A wins against B if A unidirectionally blocks B.   
2. antaraṅga > bahiraṅga: according to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the 
causes (of the application) of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga 
rule’.17 Note that this tool is seldom used to solve actual cases of conflict and is mostly only 
used to solve what I call cases of pseudo-conflict. We will delve into this in Appendix C. 
3. apavāda > utsarga: an exception rule, or a more specific rule, defeats the general rule. 
4. pūrvavipratiṣiddha: when applying 1.4.2 gives the wrong answer, Kātyāyana comes up with 
pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas. These state that in certain cases, contrary to what is taught by the 
traditional interpretation of 1.4.2, it is not the para rule (the rule which comes after the other 
rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī), but instead the pūrva rule (the rule that comes before 
the other rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī) that wins. Pūrvavipratiṣiddha too has come 
to be used like a conflict resolution tool. Here are two well-known examples of such vārttikas 
(vt. 10 and 1118 respectively on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca): 
 
16 In the previous chapter I have discussed the hierarchy of these rules (Pbh 38 of the 
Paribhāṣenduśekhara), so I do not discuss it here again. This hierarchy is not of much consequence, 
practically speaking.

47 
 
a. vt. 10 guṇavr̥ ddhyauttvatr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham: in case of vipratiṣedha, 
the pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUM, takes precedence over para 
sūtras which teach (i) guṇa19, (ii) vr̥ ddhi20, (iii) auttva21, (iv) tr̥ jvadbhāva22. 
b. vt. 11 numaciratr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ (pūrvavipratiṣiddham): in case of vipratiṣedha, the 
pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUṬ23 takes precedence over para 
sūtras which teach (i) numāgama ‘insertion of augment nUM’24, (ii) replacement with r when 
followed by a vowel (aC)25, (iii) tr̥ jvadbhāva26.  
5. niravakāśa / anavakāśa > sāvakāśa27: In his first vārttika28 on 1.4.2, Kātyāyana defines 
vipratiṣedha as a conflict which arises between two sāvakāśa rules: dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv 
ekasmin sa vipratiṣedhaḥ ‘[When] two rules [which are] applicable elsewhere (i.e., in other 
derivations) [become applicable] at the same place, this [situation is called] vipratiṣedha’.  But 
when one of the two rules is niravakāśa, that is, when it does not have scope to apply elsewhere, 
such a conflict is not called vipratiṣedha. In such cases, the niravakāśa rule is thought to be 
stronger than the sāvakāśa rule. The niravakāśa rule wins. 
As discussed in the previous chapter, the tradition does not apply these tools consistently, and 
often, applying some of these tools gives the wrong form. Nonetheless, through the table 
presented below, I try to give a broad and general overview of the tools that are used to deal 
with different kinds of conflicts:

21 7.3.119 ac ca gheḥ.

operations’ (Pbh 11 of Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). 
28 Mbh I.304.13. 

48 
 
 
Lastly, alongside these tools, the tradition liberally uses (its interpretation of) 1.4.2 to deal with 
all kinds of conflict when it is necessary and / or desirable to do so.  
 
2.7 Examples of DOI 
In my opinion, 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam means: in the event of DOI, the RHS rule 
wins. As stated before, I have not used the term ‘rule conflict’ in my interpretation of 1.4.2. 
This is because I think that Pāṇini does not require us to use such a concept to understand 1.4.2, 
and consequently, to perform derivations correctly. 
However, as shown above, all post-Pāṇinian discussion pertaining to 1.4.2 has focused on 
conflict. So, I do need to deal with the topic of conflict to contextualize my findings in the 
contemporary discourse. In other words, I need to show that my interpretation of 1.4.2 correctly 
resolves examples of DOI conflict, which I will call Type 2a henceforth. For each example, I 
will first prove that the example involves conflict, then discuss my solution to it, and finally 
present the traditional solution to it. 
Even though the tradition is not very interested in non-conflict, I will also show that 1.4.2 helps 
deal with examples of DOI non-conflict, which I will call Type 2b henceforth.  
Before we start looking at examples, here is a diagram which summarizes this topic:

                                                              My solution: 1.4.2 (RHS wins) 
 
Note the difference between vipratiṣedha, as interpreted by me, and the concept of conflict, 
which is popularly discussed in modern post-Pāṇinian literature, in the diagram above.  
In this section, I have chosen examples from nominal inflection.30 
In all derivations performed in this thesis, I present only those steps diagrammatically at which 
multiple rules are simultaneously applicable. For example, at step a + b, if rules R1 and R2 are 
applicable to a and b respectively, then I draw the following kind of diagram to illustrate the 
same: 
a     +     b 
 
                                                                   R1          R2 
However, if only one rule K1 is applicable (to c) at a given step c + d, then I do not draw 
diagrams of the following kind to represent this: 
 
 
29 RE = ‘Representative Example’. 
30 Note that examples from nominal inflection are simpler than those from verbal inflection. One of the 
many reasons behind this is that, while nominal inflection involves only two items, i.e., a base and affix, 
verbal inflection generally involves at least three items, i.e., a base followed by two affixes. We will 
look at examples from verbal inflections as well as primary and secondary derivatives in the following 
chapters. 

50 
 
c      +      d 
 
                                                                 K1 
Instead, I simply describe this in words, or symbolically, as follows: c + d  c* + d (K1). 
 
(1) deva + bhis – ‘God’ (masculine), instrumental plural 
      deva  +  bhis 
 
   7.3.103      7.1.9 
7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et (ataḥ supi): an e replaces the final a of a nominal base when a 
plural declensional affix starting with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 
7.1.9 ato bhisa ais: ais replaces bhis when bhis occurs after an a-final base. 
If bhis is replaced with vowel-initial ais by 7.1.9, then 7.3.103, which applies to only those 
bases which are followed by a jhaL-initial affix, will not be applicable at the following step. 
Similarly, if the a of deva is replaced with e by 7.3.103, then 7.1.9, which applies to affixes 
that are preceded by a-final bases, will not be applicable at the following step.  
Therefore, 7.1.9 and 7.3.103 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of 
Type 2a (DOI conflict). 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.9 wins, leading to the correct form: deva 
+ ais  devais (6.1.88 vr̥ ddhir eci)  devair (8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ)  devaiḥ (8.3.15 
kharavasānayor visarjanīyaḥ). 
In his comments on 7.1.9, Patañjali tries to solve this conflict by using paratva (the rule that 
comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) but that gives the wrong answer: 
*devebhis. He then asserts that 7.1.9 is nitya and thus wins, giving the correct form: devaiḥ.31 
His explanation for calling 7.1.9 nitya is illogical at best, and we will not delve into it. Suffice 
it to say that the nitya tool, which can only solve cases of unidirectional blocking, cannot be 
applied to the present case of mutual blocking. Pradīpa and Uddyota, the two popular 
commentaries on the Mahābhāṣya suggest that the rule 7.1.9 is anavakāśa whereas 7.3.103 is 
 
31 Mbh III.244.13-21. 

51 
 
sāvakāśa. So, the former wins. The anavakāśa tool is simply a technical way of arguing the 
following:  
(i) 7.1.9 does not apply anywhere else.  
(ii) Surely, Pāṇini must have composed 7.1.9 because it applies somewhere.  
From (i) and (ii), the tradition concludes that it has to apply here. 
For this and many other examples, instead of following a systematic procedure of rule conflict 
resolution, the tradition adopts a trial-and-error approach to come up with a justification for the 
application of the rule which leads to the correct form. 
 
(2) hari + āṄ – ‘green’ (masculine), instrumental singular 
               hari     +    āṄ32 
 
                  6.1.77          7.3.120 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 
7.3.120 āṅo nāstriyām: nā replaces the affix āṄ, when it occurs after a non-feminine base 
termed ghi (a base ending in i or u except sakhi).  
If the i of hari is replaced with y by 6.1.77, then 7.3.120 which applies only to bases ending in 
i or u, will not be applicable at the following step. And if āṄ is replaced with consonant-initial 
nā, then 6.1.77, which could have applied to the i of hari when it is followed by a vowel, will 
no longer be applicable. Thus, 7.3.120 and 6.1.77 block each other. 
This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.3.120 wins, leading to the correct form: 
hariṇā.33  
 
32 The instrumental singular affix taught by 4.1.2 sv-au-jas… is Ṭā and not āṄ. The use of āṄ instead 
of Ṭā “is best understood as reflecting earlier traditions” (Cardona 1997: 51). 
33 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi. 

52 
 
To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this conflict. But I would guess 
that it would have used its interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later in the serial order 
of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) or niravakāśatva to solve it. 
 
(3) vāri + āṄ – ‘water’ (neuter), instrumental singular 
For reasons I will clarify below, let us look at the three rules which are applicable at this step 
without resorting to a diagram: 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 
7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base ending 
in iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 
7.3.120 āṅo nāstriyām: same as above.  
The important question to ask here is, how should we regard the interaction between 6.1.77 iko 
yaṇ aci and 7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau? Is it a case of SOI or that of DOI? 
One could argue that it is a case of DOI. Let me explain why. 6.1.77 is applicable to i of vāri. 
On the other hand, by 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ (which teaches that an item marked with M 
is placed after i.e., to the RHS of the last vowel of the morpheme), 7.1.73 is applicable, not to 
i, but instead to the (currently empty) position that is to the right-hand side of i. Additionally, 
note that 1.1.47 uses the term para which is also used in the rule governing DOI (cf. 1.4.2 
vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam). For these reasons, one could say that the two rules are applicable 
to two different operands. Here is the diagrammatic representation of the same: 
   vār      i                                        +         āṄ 
 
                                                6.1.77          7.1.73                          7.3.120 
On the other hand, one could argue that the interaction between 6.1.77 and 7.1.73 is a case of 
SOI because the whole base vāri itself is the common operand of both 6.1.77 and 7.1.73. Here 
is the diagrammatic representation of the same:  
                                                         [vāri]                 +                   āṄ 
 
                                                6.1.77          7.1.73                       7.3.120 

53 
 
In fact, we ought to answer other similar questions before moving forward: if there is an SSRI 
between a rule teaching the attachment of an augment marked with Ṭ (cf. 1.1.46 ādyantau 
ṭakitau34) to a given item and a rule teaching the substitution of the first sound of that item, 
then should that interaction be treated as an SOI or as a DOI? Similarly, if there is an SSRI 
between a rule teaching the attachment of an augment marked with K (cf. 1.1.46 ādyantau 
ṭakitau) to a given item and a rule teaching the substitution of the last sound of that item, then 
should that interaction be treated as an SOI or as a DOI? 
Without looking at a large number of examples of SSRI involving augments marked with M, 
Ṭ or K, it would be difficult to decide which of the two positions is correct. In my thesis, I do 
not focus on augments and thus am not in a position to definitively answer the aforementioned 
questions. For the sake of this thesis, I have treated examples of the aforementioned kind 
involving M-marked augments as cases of DOI and those of the aforementioned kind involving 
Ṭ- or K-marked augments as cases of SOI. I have done this so that the reader may get exposure 
to both positions – one, that these are cases of SOI and the other, that these are cases of DOI. 
This will help set the stage for future research on this topic.  
Coming back to the present example, this is a case of DOI between the three rules.  
                                          vār      i                                        +         āṄ 
 
                                                6.1.77          7.1.73                          7.3.120 
Now let us look at the relationships between these rules. We have already seen in the previous 
example that 6.1.77 and 7.3.120 block each other.  
Let us look at the DOI interaction between 6.1.77 and 7.1.73. If vāri takes the augment nUM 
by 7.1.73, then we get vārin which does not end in vowel i and thus, 6.1.77 will not be 
applicable at the following step. If i of vāri is replaced with y by 6.1.77, then we get vāry which 
does not end in i, thus 7.1.73 will not be applicable at the following step. Thus, 6.1.77 and 
7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
Now let us look at the DOI interaction between 7.1.73 and 7.3.120. If vāri takes the augment 
nUM by 7.1.73, thereby becoming consonant-final vārin, then 7.3.120, which applies only to 
 
34 Items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the beginning and end 
respectively. 

54 
 
those affixes that are preceded by ghi bases ending in i or u, will not be applicable at the 
following step. And if consonant-initial nā replaces Ṭā by 7.3.120, then 7.1.73 which only 
applies to certain bases followed by vowel-initial affixes will not be applicable at the following 
step. Thus, 7.3.120 and 7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of 
DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.3.12035 and get the correct form: 
vāriṇā.36  
We have already discussed the traditional position on the conflict between 6.1.77 and 7.3.120 
in the previous example. I do not think the tradition discusses the conflict between 6.1.77 and 
7.1.73. We can assume that it would use its interpretation of 1.4.2 (the rule that comes later in 
the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) or the apavāda tool to solve this conflict. As for the 
conflict between 7.1.73 and 7.3.120, the Bālamanoramā commentary on the 
Siddhāntakaumudī solves it using the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2.  
 
(4) strī + ām – ‘woman’ (feminine), genitive plural 
 
strī        +        ām 
 
 
6.4.79          7.1.54 
6.4.79 striyāḥ (aci iyaṅ): the final sound of the base strī is replaced with iyAṄ when a vowel-
initial affix follows. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a 
nominal base which ends in a short vowel, or is termed nadī (feminine long ī- and ū-final 
bases), or has taken the feminine affix ṬāP. 
If the ī of strī is replaced with iyAṄ by 6.4.79, thereby making it striy, then 7.1.54, which 
applies to ām when preceded by nadī-final vowels ī and ū, will not be applicable at the 
following step.  
 
35 Note that this is one of the rare cases in which even if we had applied another rule, namely 7.1.73, 
we would still have got the correct form.  
36 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi. 

55 
 
If the augment nUṬ is added to the affix ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it consonant-initial nām, 
then 6.4.79, which is only applicable to the base strī when it is followed by vowel-initial affixes, 
will not be applicable at the following step.  
This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form: 
strīṇām.37 
The Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī solves the conflict between 6.4.79 
and 7.1.54 using the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2 (i.e., the rule that comes later in the serial 
order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins). 
 
(5) vāri + ām – ‘water’ (neuter), genitive plural 
          vāri         +     ām 
 
             7.1.73          7.1.54 
7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base ending 
in iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 
If the augment nUM is attached to vāri by 7.1.73, thereby making it consonant-final vārin 
(1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ), then 7.1.54, which only applies to ām when it is preceded by 
certain vowel-final bases, will not be applicable at the following step.  
On the other hand, if the augment nUṬ is attached to the affix ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it 
consonant-initial nām, then 7.1.73, which is only applicable to certain bases that are followed 
by vowel-initial affixes, will not be applicable at the following step.  
Both 7.1.54 and 7.1.73 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 
2a (DOI conflict).  
 
37 n > ṇ, by 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi. 

56 
 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form: 
vārīṇām38 (6.4.3 nāmi, 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi). 
The 
tradition 
resorts 
to 
Kātyāyana’s 
vārttika 
‘numaciratr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo 
nuṭ 
pūrvavipratiṣiddham’ (vt. 1139 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches 
that even though the rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUṬ (7.1.54) comes before 
the rule teaching the attachment of the augment of nUM (7.1.73) in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins. In this and other pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Kātyāyana simply 
lists those conflicts which cannot be correctly solved using the traditional interpretation of 
1.4.2. 
 
(6) kroṣṭu + ām – ‘jackal’ (masculine), genitive plural 
kroṣṭu      +     ām 
 
                                                                 7.1.97       7.1.54 
7.1.97 vibhāṣā tr̥ tīyādiṣv aci (tr̥ jvat kroṣṭuḥ): ‘the base kroṣṭu, is treated as if ending in affix 
tr̥ C optionally, when a vowel-initial ending of the tr̥ tīyā triplet (instrumental) or any of the 
following triplets (namely dative, ablative, genitive or locative) follows.40 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 
If the u of kroṣṭu becomes r̥  by 7.1.97, then 7.1.54, which applies to ām when it is preceded by 
any of the short vowels, will be applicable to ām at the following step. But if the augment nUṬ 
is added to ām by 7.1.54, thereby making it (consonant-initial) nām, then 7.1.97, which applies 
to kroṣṭu only when it is followed by a vowel-initial tritīyādi affix, will not be applicable at the 
following step.  
 
38 Note that both augments i.e., nUM and nUṬ essentially refer to the same sound n. However, if we 
applied the rule prescribing nUM, we would get vārin + ām (1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt paraḥ). In such a 
situation, we would not be able to elongate the ī of vārin because 6.4.3 nāmi would not apply here. 
39 Mbh III.276.6. 
40 Note that this is not actually an operational rule, but an atideśa sūtra ‘extension rule’. For the sake 
of studying conflict, we may treat it as an operational rule which teaches that the u of kroṣṭu changes to 
r̥ . 

57 
 
7.1.54 blocks 7.1.97, but 7.1.97 does not block 7.1.54. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, 
and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form: 
kroṣṭūnām (6.4.3 nāmi). 
Since this is a case of unidirectional blocking, the tradition could have used the nitya tool to 
solve this conflict. However, it does not do so.41 Instead, Kātyāyana has written the vārttika 
‘numaciratr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo nuṭ pūrvavipratiṣiddham’ (vt. 1142 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve 
it. This vārttika teaches that even though the rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUṬ 
(7.1.54) comes before the rule teaching tr̥ jvadbhāva (7.1.97) in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins.  
 
(7) kartr̥  + sU – ‘doer’ (neuter), nominative singular 
kartr̥            +           sU 
 
                                                      7.1.94                      7.1.23                  
7.1.94 r̥ duśanaspurudaṁso’nehasāṁ ca (asambuddhau anaṅ sau): the final sound of a base 
ending in r̥ Ṭ or of the bases uśanas, purudaṁsas and anehas is substituted with anAṄ when 
followed by non-vocative sU. 
7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base are substituted 
with LUK. 
If we apply 7.1.23, then 7.1.94, which applies only when followed by sU, will not be applicable 
at the following step. If we apply 7.1.94, then 7.1.23, which applies to any neuter base 
regardless of its final sound, will be applicable at the following step.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.23 wins, thereby giving the correct form: 
kartr̥ . 
 
41 This is discussed in Pradīpa on vt. 11, 7.1.96. 
42 Mbh III.276.6.  

58 
 
To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this conflict. However, I think it 
would use the nitya tool (the rule that unidirectionally blocks the other wins) to solve it. 
 
(8) tad + sU – ‘that’ (neuter), nominative singular 
                                                                  tad    +  sU 
 
                                                            7.2.102       7.1.23    
7.2.102 tyadādīnām aḥ (vibhaktau): the final sound of a base belonging to the group headed by 
tyad ‘that’ is replaced with a when a declensional affix follows. 
7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): same as above. 
What kind of interaction occurs between the two rules? The tradition seems to be confused 
about this. So, let us start by looking at my solution. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.23 wins, giving us the 
correct answer: tad.43 
In his commentary44 on 7.1.23, Patañjali first tries to use the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2 
(the rule that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī wins) to determine which of the 
two rules he must apply. But he gets the wrong answer upon doing so. Then, he tries to use the 
nitya tool.  
If we apply 7.1.23 at this step, 7.2.102 will not be applicable at the following step. On the other 
hand, if we apply 7.2.102 at this step, 7.1.23 will still be applicable at the following step. Thus, 
this is a case of unidirectional blocking, and of Type 2a (DOI conflict). Therefore, the nitya 
tool can be used here.  
However, Patañjali then says that 7.1.23 is not nitya with respect to 7.2.102. This is because, 
after the hypothetical application of 7.2.102, 7.1.23 is not the only rule that will be applicable. 
7.1.24 ato ’m45 will also be applicable. Since 7.1.24 is an apavāda of 7.1.23, the former will 
win. So 7.1.23 will, despite being applicable, fail to apply, following the application of 7.2.102. 
 
43 Note that 7.2.102 is not applicable at this point, thanks to 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya. 
44 Mbh III.248.23-249.2. 
45 Affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base ending in a are replaced with am. 

59 
 
For this reason, Patañjali says that 7.1.23 cannot be called nitya with respect to 7.2.102. To 
deal with this problem, Patañjali suggests some changes in the wording of 7.1.23 svamor 
napuṁsakāt. We will not dwell on his argument, because it is beyond our scope.    
Contrary to Patañjali’s conclusion that 7.1.23 cannot be called nitya, according to paribhāṣā 
47 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, 7.1.23 is nitya and thus should win. It reads: yasya ca 
lakṣaṇāntareṇa nimittaṁ vihanyate na tad anityam. Kielhorn translates it as follows: ‘(an 
operation [here 7.1.23]), the cause of which would, (after the taking effect of another operation 
[here, 7.2.102] that applies simultaneously), be removed by another (third) rule [here, 7.1.24], 
is not (on that account regarded as) anitya.’  
 
(9) vāri + Ṅe – ‘water’ (neuter), dative singular 
vār       i                          +            Ṅe 
 
                                                     7.3.111       7.1.73                                                           
7.3.111 gher ṅiti (guṇaḥ supi): the final vowel of a ghi base (a base ending in i or u, except 
sakhi) is replaced with guṇa (here, e / o) when followed by a declensional affix marked with 
Ṅ. 
7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter base which 
ends in iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ), provided a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 
This is a case of DOI. If we apply 7.3.111 at this step, then 7.1.73 will not be applicable at the 
following step. If we apply 7.1.73 at this step, then 7.3.111 will not be applicable at the 
following step. This is a case of mutual blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict). 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.73 and get the correct form: vāriṇe. 
The tradition uses the vārttika, guṇavr̥ ddhyauttvatr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham 
(vt. 1046 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca) to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches that even though the 
rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUM (7.1.73) comes before the rule teaching guṇa 
(7.3.111) in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former wins. 
 
46 Mbh III.275.23. 

60 
 
Having looked at examples of DOI conflict (Type 2a), now let us look at examples of DOI non-
conflict (Type 2b). 
 
(10) rājan + sU – ‘king’ (masculine), nominative singular 
  rājan   +   sU 
 
                                                                   6.4.8        6.1.68 
6.4.8 sarvanāmasthāne cāsambuddhau (nopadhāyāḥ dīrghaḥ): the penultimate sound of a base 
ending in n is replaced with its dīrgha ‘long’ equivalent when a non-vocative sarvanāmasthāna 
affix (sU, au, Jas, am, auṬ in non-neuter forms or Śi) follows. 
6.1.68 halṅyābbhyo dīrghāt sutisyapr̥ ktaṁ hal (lopaḥ): there is elision by LOPA of the finite 
verb affixes ti and si, when they consist of a single sound and follow a form which ends in a 
consonant, and of the nominative singular case affix sU, when it follows a form which ends in 
a consonant or the long final vowel of feminine affixes Ṅī or āP. 
If 6.4.8 applies at step K, we get rājān, which still ends in a consonant. So 6.1.68 will be 
applicable at the step K+1. If sU is replaced with LOPA by 6.1.68 at step K, the properties of 
the affix sU still hold (cf. 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam), so 6.4.8 will be applicable 
at step K+1.  
We see that 6.4.8 and 6.1.68 do not block each other. This is a case of Type 2b (DOI non-
conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.1.68 wins and we get rājan. Now thanks to 1.1.62 
pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, we apply 6.4.8 and get rājān. At this juncture, we apply 8.2.7 
nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya47, which teaches that n is replaced with LOPA at the end of a 
nominal stem which is termed pada, and get the correct form: rājā. 
Note that even if we had applied 6.4.8 (the LHS rule) at the first step, we could have still applied 
6.1.68 at the following step. And applying these two rules in this order too would have given 
us the correct form. 
 
47 8.2.7 is asiddha with respect to 6.4.8 and 6.1.68 so it cannot be applied before them.  

61 
 
Why then did Pāṇini need to say anything about DOI non-conflict at all? Why did he prescribe 
that the RHS be applied in such cases (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.2)? We will answer this 
question while discussing the following examples.  
The tradition is not interested in such cases of non-conflict.   
  
(11) tri + ām – ‘three’ (feminine), genitive plural 
                 tri     +      ām 
 
            7.2.99          7.1.54 
7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥ catasr̥ : tri and catur are replaced with tisr̥  and catasr̥  respectively 
in the feminine. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām48 when it occurs after 
a nominal base which ends in a short vowel, or is termed nadī (feminine bases ending with ī 
and ū), or has taken the feminine affix ṬāP. 
If we replace tri with tisr̥  at this step, 7.1.54 will still be applicable at the following step because 
tisr̥  ends in a short vowel. And if we apply 7.1.54 at this step, 7.2.99 will still be applicable at 
the following step, because its application does not depend on the affix. 
Neither of the two rules blocks the other, and so this is a case of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.54 and get tri + nām. Thereafter, we 
apply 7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥ catasr̥  and get the correct form: tisr̥ ṇām49. 
In order to understand why Pāṇini has prescribed that we pick the RHS rule in cases of DOI 
non-conflict, let us perform this derivation again, this time by picking the LHS rule in case of 
DOI non-conflict.  
 
48 The augment nUṬ is added at the beginning of ām by 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau. 
49 The r̥  of tisr̥  does not undergo elongation by 6.4.3 nāmi because this is prohibited by the following 
rule 6.4.4 na tisr̥ catasr̥ . The n of nām becomes ṇ in tisr̥ ṇām. There is no rule in the Aṣṭādhyāyī which 
explicitly teaches this. However, there is a vārttika on 8.4.1 raṣābhyāṁ no ṇaḥ samānapade which 
correctly teaches this operation: raṣābhyāṁ ṇatvam r̥ kāragrahaṇam ‘it should be added that [not only] 
after r and ṣ, [but after] r̥  [too], [n is replaced with] ṇ.’ (Mbh III.452.1-6). 

62 
 
                  tri        +     ām 
 
               7.2.99             7.1.54 
7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥ catasr̥ : same as above. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 
This is a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). As stated above, as an experiment, we are going to apply 
the LHS rule 7.2.99 in this case (of DOI non-conflict). Upon applying 7.2.99, we get tisr̥  + ām. 
Here, two rules are applicable: 
                                                               tisr̥       +       ām 
 
 7.2.100         7.1.54 
7.2.100 aci ra r̥ taḥ (vibhaktau tricaturoḥ tisr̥ catasr̥ ): a r replaces r̥  of the bases tisr̥  and catasr̥ , 
when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ (āmi): same as above. 
If r̥  is replaced with consonant r by 7.2.100, then 7.1.54, which applies to ām when it is 
preceded by certain vowel-final bases will not be applicable at the following step. And if ām 
takes augment nUṬ by 7.1.54, thereby becoming consonant-initial nām, then 7.2.100 which 
applies to r̥  when a vowel-initial affix follows will not be applicable at the following step.  
Thus, 7.2.100 and 7.1.54 block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and thus of Type 
2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS operation 7.1.54 wins, leading to the correct form: 
tisṛṇām.  
We have seen that, regardless of whether we pick the LHS or the RHS rule in case of Type 2b 
(DOI non-conflict) here, we get the same answer: tisr̥ ṇām. However, the two derivational paths 
look different from each other. The first path, in which we pick the RHS rule at the first step 
(as taught by Pāṇini in [my interpretation of] 1.4.2), is significantly shorter than the second 
path, in which we pick the LHS rule at the first step. In other derivations too, I have noticed 
that the derivation looks relatively shorter when we pick the RHS rule in case of type 2b (DOI 
non-conflict) and relatively longer when we pick the LHS rule.  

63 
 
But is it merely to keep derivations compact that Pāṇini has prescribed the choice of the RHS 
rule in cases of DOI non-conflict? No. In the next example, we will see that we cannot get the 
correct answer without picking the RHS rule in case of DOI non-conflict. 
How does the tradition perform this derivation? Vārttikas 11 to 1450 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca, and 
Patañjali’s comments on them, deal with this topic in detail and propose various tools like 
pūrvavipratiṣiddha and apavāda to solve this problem.  We will not delve into this topic here. 
 
(12) idam + Ṅe – ‘this’ (masculine), dative singular 
All cases of DOI in this derivation are of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). I will not prove this at 
each step.  
id           a         m     +     Ṅe 
 
                                                 7.2.112             7.2.102 
7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): the id of idam is substituted with an, when it 
does not include a k, and when a declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., any instrumental, 
dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 
7.2.102 tyadādīnām aḥ (vibhaktau): the final sound of a base belonging to the group headed by 
tyad ‘that’ is replaced with a when a declensional affix follows. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.2.102 wins, and we get: ida-a + Ṅe. Here, 
multiple rules are applicable: 
id         [ a-a ]         +       Ṅe 
 
                                                7.2.112      6.1.97             7.1.14 
7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): same as above. 
6.1.97 ato guṇe: when a short a, which is not pada-final (word-final) is followed by a guṇa 
vowel i.e., a, e, or o, then both a and the following guṇa are replaced with the latter. 
 
50 Mbh III.276.6-22. 

64 
 
7.1.14 sarvanāmnaḥ smai (ṅer yaḥ ataḥ): the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a pronominal base 
ending in a, is replaced with smai. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.1.14, and get ida-a + smai. Here, 
multiple rules are applicable: 
id                                  [ a-a ]                +                smai      
 
          7.2.112                7.2.113                 6.1.97 
7.2.112 an āpy akaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ): the id of idam is substituted with an, when it 
does not include a k, and when a declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., any instrumental, 
dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 
7.2.113 hali lopaḥ (vibhaktau idamaḥ idaḥ akaḥ): the id of idam is replaced with LOPA, when 
it does not include a k, and when a consonant-initial declensional affix belonging to āP, i.e., 
any instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive or locative affix, follows. 
6.1.97 ato guṇe: same as above. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.97 and get ida + smai. Here multiple 
rules are applicable: 
                                                                id             a                   +          smai 
 
                                            7.2.112                  7.2.113  
We see that there is a case of SOI between 7.2.112 and 7.2.113. Because 7.2.113 applies only 
when the base is followed by a consonant initial affix, it is more specific than, and defeats 
7.2.112. Thus, we get the correct form: asmai. 
At the very first step of this derivation, where we see the two rules 7.2.112 and 7.2.102 involved 
in DOI non-conflict, if we had chosen to apply the LHS rule 7.2.112 instead of the RHS rule 
7.2.102, we would have got the wrong form at the end of the derivation: *anasmai. The same 
can be said about the second step too: picking 7.2.112 at the second step instead of 7.1.14 too 
would have given us the wrong form: *anasmai.  
This shows that, even though whether we choose the LHS rule or the RHS rule may not matter 
in certain cases of DOI non-conflict (see examples 10 and 11 above), in cases of DOI non-
conflict like this one, choosing the RHS rule alone gives the correct answer.  

65 
 
Finally, let us look at an example which involves cases of both DOI conflict and DOI non-
conflict. 
 
(13) asmad + sU – ‘I’ (any gender), nominative singular 
 asma           d     +     sU 
 
                                                      7.2.94       7.2.86          7.1.28 
7.2.94 tvāhau sau (yuṣmadasmador maparyantasya vibhaktau): the parts of yuṣmad and asmad 
extending up to ma51 are replaced with tva and aha respectively when followed by the case 
affix sU. 
7.2.86 yuṣmadasmador anādeśe (vibhaktau āḥ): the final sounds of yuṣmad and asmad are 
replaced with ā when followed by consonant-initial case affixes which have not undergone any 
substitution.  
7.1.28 ṅeprathamayor am (yuṣmadasmadbhyāṁ vibhaktau): Ṅe, and nominative, accusative 
affixes are replaced with am when preceded by yuṣmad and asmad. 
Let us determine the relationship between 7.2.94 and the two other rules.  
If we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.2.86 will be applicable at the following step. Similarly, if we 
apply 7.2.86 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step. There is a Type 2b 
(DOI non-blocking) relationship between 7.2.94 and 7.2.86.  
Similarly, if we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.1.28 will be applicable at the following step. If we 
apply 7.1.28 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step.52 There is a Type 2b 
(DOI non-blocking) relationship between 7.2.94 and 7.1.28.  
 
51 The tradition translates maparyantasya as ‘up to m’ but I think that Pāṇini means ‘up to ma’. Both 
interpretations lead to correct answers for all forms of yuṣmad-asmad. My interpretation makes 
derivations simpler and shorter.  
52 Given that sU has been replaced with am, how will 7.2.94 apply at the following step? This is because, 
by 1.1.56 sthānivadādeśo’nalvidhau, am is treated like sU. How do we know this is not an aL-vidhi? 
asma and am are not adjacent to each other (d sits in the middle of the two), and so this is not an aL 
operation.

Thus 7.2.94 has a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict) with the other two rules.  
Now let us determine the relationship between 7.2.86 and 7.1.28. If we apply 7.2.86 at this 
step, 7.1.28 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply 7.1.28 at this 
step, then the affix sU will undergo ādeśa ‘substitution’ with am. 7.2.86 can only apply to 
asmad when followed by a non-substituted, consonant-initial affix. Thus, 7.2.86 will not be 
applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a 
(DOI conflict). 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.1.28 and get: asmad + am. Here 
again, two rules are applicable: 
asma        d        +         am 
 
                                                     7.2.94     7.2.90 
7.2.90 śeṣe lopaḥ: the final sounds of yuṣmad and asmad are replaced with LOPA when 
followed by case affixes not listed in the preceding rules (7.2.86-89).53  
If we apply 7.2.94 at this step, 7.2.90 will still be applicable at the following step. If we apply 
7.2.90 at this step, 7.2.94 will be applicable at the following step. This is a case of no blocking, 
and thus of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 
7.2.90 and get asma + am. Lastly, we apply 7.2.94 and get aha + am, to which we apply 6.1.97 
ato guṇe.54 This gives the correct form: aham.  
As stated in a footnote on 7.2.94, the traditional interpretation of 7.2.94 is different from mine. 
Thus, its derivational process is different and slightly longer. We will not delve into it here. I 
will simply say that the tradition would have resolved the DOI conflict in this example using 
the nitya tool. 
 
53 Note that, here, the affix sU has undergone ādeśa ‘substitution’ with am. So, 7.2.86, which can only 
apply to asmad when followed by a non-substituted and consonant initial affix, and which was 
applicable in the previous step, is no longer applicable at this step. Instead of that rule, 7.2.90 has 
become applicable.  
54 An a which is not at the end of a pada and the guṇa vowel following it are both replaced with the 
latter. 

67 
 
This brings us to the end of examples of DOI in this chapter. We will, of course, study more 
examples of DOI conflict in later chapters. Before we go to the next section, here I want to 
emphasize that I have discussed blocking and conflict in these derivations only because post-
Pāṇinian scholarship is interested in these topics. In other words, I have attempted to show that 
examples of conflict can be solved by my interpretation of 1.4.2.  
Note that, if we had simply avoided talking about blocking and conflict, we would have 
completed these derivations almost effortlessly, by simply picking the right-most rule (cf. my 
interpretation of 1.4.2) in every case of DOI, irrespective of whether or not the rules in question 
are involved in any kind of conflict. 
 
2.8 Examples of SOI 
Having discussed examples of DOI, I will now show, through the following examples, that my 
solution (i.e., the more specific rule wins) helps deal with cases of SOI. Note that we find very 
few examples of RE 5 (SOI non-conflict) in Pāṇinian derivations. These cases are neither 
particularly challenging nor of interest to the tradition. Thus, I will only discuss cases of 
conflict here. To avoid redundancy, I will refrain from reiterating or proving the existence of 
conflict in these examples. I will also develop a systematic procedure to identify which rule is 
more specific. At the end of each example, I will mention the traditional solution. 
 
Type 1 (SOI)  
 
unidirectional blocking (RE 1)             mutual blocking (RE 2)               no blocking (RE 5) 
 
                                      SOI conflict                                                       SOI non-conflict 
       
  
My solution: the rule which is more specific (i.e., the exception rule) wins

(1) rāma + bhyas – ‘Rāma’ (masculine), dative plural 
                   rāma + bhyas 
 
                                                                7.3.102         7.3.103 
7.3.102 supi ca (ato dīrgho yañi): the a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long 
equivalent when followed by a declensional affix starting with yaÑ (i.e., y, v, r l, jh, bh or any 
nasal). 
7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et (ataḥ supi): the a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e 
when followed by a plural declensional affix starting with jhaL (any non-nasal stop or 
fricative).  
Note that the sets of operands of both rules are exactly the same, namely the final a of a nominal 
stem. 
 
operands of 7.3.102 = operands of 7.3.103 
 
However, the sets of contexts of the two rules are different. Neither set is a subset of the other. 
Instead, the two sets intersect each other.  
final a of a nominal stem

                     contexts of 7.3.102                               contexts of 7.3.103 
So how do we decide which rule is ‘more specific?’ Let us develop a procedure that we can 
use to deal with all examples of SOI.  
Each Pāṇinian rule actually represents a collection of one or more sub-rules. For example, 
consider 7.3.102 which teaches that  
a& + yaÑ !  ā& + yaÑ ! 
[& = end of nominal stem; ! = beginning of case affix] 
7.3.102 represents the following collection of sub-rules: 
1. a& + y! ā& + y! 
2. a& + v! ā& + v! 
3. a& + r! ā& + r! 
4. a& + l! ā& + l! 
5. a& + ñ! ā& + ñ! 
6. a& + m! ā& + m! 
7. a& + ṅ! ā& + ṅ! 
8. a& +ṇ! ā& + ṇ! 
other case affixes 
starting with 
y, v, r, l, ñ, m, ṅ,
ṇ, n, jh, bh 
plural case affixes 
starting with
other sounds of jhaL
plural case 
affixes 
starting 
with jh or 
bh 

70 
 
9. a& + n! ā& + n! 
10. a& + jh! ā& + jh! 
11. a& + bh! ā& + bh! 
Pāṇini teaches these 11 sub-rules together in the form of the rule 7.3.102, using his pratyāhāra 
system, purely for the sake of brevity. Similarly, let us deconstruct 7.3.103 which teaches: 
a& + jhaL! # e & + jhaL! # 
[& = end of nominal stem; ! = beginning of case affix; # = plural] 
7.3.103 can be represented by the following collection of sub-rules: 
1. a& + jh! # e & + jh! # 
2. a& + bh! # e & + bh! # 
3. a& + gh! # e & + gh! # 
4. a& + ḍh! # e & + ḍh! # 
5. a& + dh! # e & + dh! # 
…and so on. 
Note that two sub-rules from the collection represented by 7.3.102 namely 11 and 12, which I 
have underlined, look similar to their respective underlined counterparts in the collection 
represented by 7.3.103. The actual SOI takes place between these two pairs of sub-rules. In 
fact, when I say that the more specific rule prevails in case of SOI, I mean, the more specific 
‘subrule’ prevails.   
The other (non-underlined) subrules just happen to be represented by 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 
respectively and are actually completely irrelevant to the SOI at hand.  
We know that jh is not present at the beginning of any case affix, so we will focus on the sub-
rules which apply to the final a of nominal stems when they are followed by bh-initial case 
affixes.  
Relevant subrule of 7.3.102  
Relevant subrule of 7.3.103 
 
11. a& + bh! ā& + bh! 
 
2. a& + bh! # e & + bh! # 

71 
 
Note that we find an extra # symbol in case of sub-rule 2 under 7.3.103. This # stands for plural. 
Therefore, we conclude that subrule 2 under 7.3.103 is more specific than sub-rule 11 under 
7.3.102 and thus wins. Henceforth, I shall take the liberty to rephrase this as ‘7.3.103 is more 
specific than 7.3.102 and thus wins’.  
I will discuss this detailed procedure for the next example too. But after that, to avoid 
redundancy, I will present this procedure in an abbreviated form for all examples of SOI in this 
thesis. I will now present the abbreviated form of the procedure discussed above for the present 
example. 
Let us consider the conditions in which each of the two rules 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 apply. Note 
that here I draw a distinction between a rule and a condition: a rule can apply in multiple 
conditions. This clarification is important insofar as the exact conditions in which a rule applies 
can vary, as I will show below.   
7.3.102 applies to: 
base ending in a + declensional affix starting with bh 
base ending in a + declensional affix starting with any other sound of yaÑ 
7.3.103 applies to: 
base ending in a + declensional affix starting with bh (plural)  
base ending in a + declensional affix starting with any other sound of jhaL (plural) 
Notice that I write sounds, for example, a, bh, yaÑ, jhaL etc., outside of brackets and all their 
characteristics such as being a plural affix, being a neuter base etc. inside brackets. I treat 
sounds and their characteristics as two distinct sources of information. Broadly speaking, I will 
follow this convention for all examples of SOI discussed throughout this thesis.  
In every case of SOI, only one condition per rule is relevant to the conflict. I mark the relevant 
conditions by writing them in bold fonts, as can be seen above. I will do the same for the rest 
of the examples. We compare the two and determine which one is more specific.   
Here the rule including the condition ‘in the plural’ (bahuvacane) is more specific than the 
other rule, which has no restriction based on number. So, the rule teaching the operation 
reserved for the plural, that is rule 7.3.103, wins, leading to the correct form: rāmebhyaḥ. 

72 
 
The Mahābhāṣya55 on 7.3.103 and the Kāśikā on 1.4.2 state that both 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 are 
sāvakāśa: 7.3.102 applies in derivations of forms like vr̥ kṣābhyām and plakṣābhyām, and 
7.3.103 applies in derivations of forms like vr̥ kṣeṣu and plakṣeṣu. As stated before, Kātyāyana 
teaches that vipratiṣedha takes place between two sāvakāśa rules. Thus, by the traditional 
interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, the rule which comes later in the serial order 
of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, namely 7.3.103, wins.  
 
(2) Now let us consider the sandhi between the two words of the compound rāmaudārya 
‘Rāma’s generosity’. We will not look at how this compound is formed, confining ourselves to 
the relevant step of the derivation: 
rām[a + au]dārya 
 
                                                         6.1.87          6.1.88 
6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ (aci): guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel immediately following it. 
6.1.88 vr̥ ddhir eci (āt): vr̥ ddhi (ā, ai, au) replaces both a and the eC vowel (e, o, ai, au) 
immediately following it.56  
6.1.87 which teaches that 
a + aC  a / e / o   
can be rewritten as the following collection of sub-rules: 
a + a  a 
a + i  e 
a + u  o 
a + r̥   a 
 
55 Mbh III.340.1-5. 
56 Note that both 6.1.87 and 6.1.88 belong to the ekādeśa-adhikāra i.e., the section headed by the sūtra 
6.1.84 ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ which teaches that both the LHS and the RHS item are replaced with a single 
substitute. 
 

73 
 
a + l̥   a 
a + e  e 
a + o  o 
a + ai  e 
a + au  o 
6.1.88 which teaches that 
a + eC  ā / ai / au  
can be rewritten as the following collection of sub-rules: 
a + e  ai 
a + o  au 
a + ai  ai 
a + au  au 
Note that the four underlined subrules under 6.1.87 correspond with the four underlined 
subrules under 6.1.88 respectively. However, both groups of underlined sub-rules are 
applicable in exactly the same four conditions, namely a + e, a + o, a + ai and a + au, 
respectively. In such a case how can we decide which one is more specific? Since we cannot 
use sub-rules alone to make this decision, we need to look at the rules themselves. Even though 
6.1.87 already deals with these four conditions, among other conditions, Pāṇini composed 
6.1.88 exclusively to deal with these four conditions.  This tells that Pāṇini wants us to apply 
6.1.88, and not 6.1.87 in this example.  
In the remaining examples I will present only abbreviated versions of this procedure, as 
follows: 
6.1.87: 
a + e/ai/o/au 
a + any other vowel 
6.1.88: 
a + e/o/ai/au 

74 
 
Unlike example 1, where one condition was slightly different from the other (by virtue of being 
marked with the grammatical restriction ‘plural’), in this example, both conditions highlighted 
in bold are exactly the same i.e., a + e/ai/o/au. In such a case, we go a step further and compare 
the two rules themselves. 6.1.88 applies only to a + e/ai/o/au whereas 6.1.87 also applies to a 
+ any other vowel. Thus 6.1.88 is more specific and wins the SOI, giving us the correct form: 
rāmaudārya.  
On 6.1.88, the Kāśikā says that 6.1.88 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 6.1.87. Even 
though the tradition does not explicitly define apavāda, I think that the tradition uses the 
apavāda tool in cases of SOI, when, for example, the conditions in which one rule, here 6.1.88, 
applies (cf. a + e/ai/o/au), clearly constitute a subset of the conditions in which the other rule, 
here 6.1.87, applies (cf. a + any vowel). In many such cases, the apavāda rule is taught in the 
close vicinity of, and often immediately after, the utsarga rule, in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. For example, the apavāda sūtra 6.1.88 is taught right after the utsarga sūtra 6.1.87.  
 
(3) Let us look at the sandhi between two padas, i.e., words, tava ‘your’ and ānandam 
‘happiness’. This example is similar to example 2. Two rules are simultaneously applicable to 
a + ā: 
                                                                tav[a  + ā]nandam 
 
                                                          6.1.87            6.1.101 
6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ (aci): guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel immediately following it. 
6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ: a long vowel replaces both aK (a, i, u, r̥ , l̥) and the immediately 
following savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ vowel. 
6.1.101: 
a + savarṇa 
i / u / r̥  / l̥  + savarṇa  
6.1.87: 
a + savarṇa 
a + any other vowel 

75 
 
Here too, like in example 2, the conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. So, we 
have to compare the two rules themselves.  
However, here, this too seems difficult. Thus, we have to eliminate those conditions which are 
completely irrelevant to the SOI at hand, namely ‘i / u / r̥  / l̥ + savarṇa’. It is likely that Pāṇini 
combined this condition with ‘a + savarṇa’ purely for the sake of brevity. So, we omit it from 
the comparison.  
6.1.101 applies only to cases of ‘a + savarṇa’ whereas 6.1.87 applies to ‘a + any other vowel’ 
as well. Thus, we conclude that 6.1.101 is more specific and wins, thereby leading to the correct 
form: tavānandam.57 To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. 
I suppose it would use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.   
 
(4) Now let us consider an example similar to example 2. We will derive the genitive plural of 
the feminine form of tri ‘three’. 
tri + ām 
 
                                                   7.1.53               7.2.99  
 
57 I must admit that my method is able to tackle other examples with greater ease as compared to this 
one. Here, I am compelled to add an extra step i.e., that of excluding the condition ‘i / u / r̥  / l̥  + savarṇa’ 
from the comparison. Perhaps we could attach greater value to Pāṇini’s use of the term savarṇa and 
characterize this SOI as follows: 
6.1.101: 
a + vowel (savarṇa) 
i / u / r̥  / l̥  + vowel (savarṇa) 
6.1.87: 
a + vowel 
I have written the conditions that are relevant to the conflict in bold. 6.1.101 is applicable only when 
the following vowel is a savarṇa. Thus, it is more specific and wins. 
 

76 
 
7.1.53 tres trayaḥ (āmi): the base tri is replaced with traya when ām follows. 
7.2.99 tricaturoḥ striyāṁ tisr̥ catasr̥  (vibhaktau): tri and catur are replaced with tisr̥  and catasr̥  
respectively in the feminine when a declensional affix follows. 
7.1.53: 
tri + ām 
7.2.99: 
tri (feminine) + ām 
tri (feminine) + any other declensional affix 
catur (feminine) + any declensional affix 
I have written the conditions that are relevant to the conflict in bold. 7.2.99 is applicable only 
to the feminine tri base, whereas 7.1.53 is applicable to the base in all genders. 7.2.99 is more 
specific and thus wins, thereby giving us the correct form: tisr̥ ṇām. 
To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would 
use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.   
Note that in the four examples above, (1) and (4) are similar to each other, and (2) and (3) are 
similar to each other.  
In both (1) and (4), the two conditions (in bold) involved in the SOI are not exactly the same. 
One operation is conditioned by a grammatical specification (‘plural’ in example 1 and 
‘feminine’ in example 4), while the other is not. The operation conditioned by the grammatical 
specification (which is often morphological) wins.  
On the other hand, in the case of examples (2) and (3), the conditions highlighted in bold are 
exactly the same, and thus we have to go a step further and compare the two rules themselves.  
For clarity, let us give names to these two types: we will call examples 1 and 4 SOI-L and 
examples 2 and 3 SOI-M. The primary definition of SOI-L is that it can be resolved at the first 
step of comparison: the conditions highlighted in bold are not exactly the same, and so the one 
which has a specific restriction or marker (e.g., plural) wins. The choice of the winning rule 
can be made at the first step of comparison itself, i.e., by comparing conditions. 

77 
 
On the other hand, SOI-M cases are defined as those where the conditions highlighted in bold 
are exactly the same, and so we cannot decide which one is more specific. We need to go a step 
further and compare the two rules themselves to determine the winning rule.  
 
(5) Now let us look at the sandhi-related step of the derivation of the compound bhānūdaya 
‘sunrise’: 
bhānu + udaya 
Here the following two rules are applicable: 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 
6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ (aci): a long vowel replaces both aK (a, i, u, r̥ , l̥) and the 
following savarṇa ‘homogeneous’ vowel. 
However, the problem is that they do not have exactly the same operand. Here I use round 
brackets to indicate the operand of 6.1.77 and square brackets to indicate the operand of 
6.1.101: 
bhān[(u)  +  u]daya 
The operand of 6.1.77 is inside the operand of 6.1.101. How do we solve such an example? I 
propose that we treat u + u as the operand of both rules. This means that we have to reanalyse 
rule 6.1.77: instead of saying that iK is replaced with yaṆ when aC follows, we say that iK + 
aC is replaced with yaṆ + aC.58     
Now that both rules have the same operand, we can choose the rule that is more specific.  
6.1.77: 
u + savarṇa 
u + any other vowel 
i / r̥  / l̥  + any vowel 
 
58 Another way of comparing the two rules is to simply compare the RHS item of each. For example, 
for 6.1.77, the RHS item is aC (any vowel) while for 6.1.101, it is specifically a savarṇa sound. This 
leads us to the correct conclusion that 6.1.101 is more specific than 6.1.77.  

78 
 
6.1.101  
u + savarṇa 
a / i / r̥  / l̥  + savarṇa 
The conditions in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we need to compare 
the two rules.  
Note that the conditions ‘i / r̥  / l̥  + any vowel’ (under 6.1.77) and ‘a / i / r̥  / l̥ + savarṇa’ (under 
6.1.101) are not relevant here because our operand is u + u. So, we won’t take these conditions 
into account. 6.1.77 applies to cases in which u is followed by any vowel. On the other hand, 
6.1.101 applies only to those cases in which u is followed by a savarṇa. 6.1.101 is more specific 
and thus wins, leading to the correct form: bhānūdaya. 
To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would 
use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to resolve it.  
 
(6) vana + sU – ‘forest’ (neuter), nominative singular 
   vana + sU 
 
                                                                7.1.23               7.1.24 
7.1.23 svamor napuṁsakāt (luk): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base are replaced 
with LUK. 
7.1.24 ato’m (svamor napuṁsakāt): affixes sU and am occurring after a neuter base ending in 
a are replaced with am. 
7.1.23 
-a (neuter) + sU / am 
- any other sound (neuter) + sU / am 
7.1.24 
-a (neuter) + sU / am 

79 
 
The conditions in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we now compare 
the rules. Both rules are meant for sU and am affixes added to neuter bases, but 7.1.24 is 
specifically meant for those cases in which sU and am are preceded by a base ending in a. 
7.1.24 is more specific and thus wins, leading to the correct form: vanam. 
On 7.1.24, the Kāśikā says that 7.1.24 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 7.1.23. 
 
(7) yuṣmad + bhyas – ‘you’ (any gender), ablative plural 
 yuṣmad + bhyas 
 
 
                                                                 7.1.30            7.1.31 
7.1.30 bhyaso bhyam (yuṣmadasmadbhyām): the affix bhyas which occurs after the bases 
yuṣmad and asmad is replaced with bhyam. 
7.1.31 pañcamyā at (yuṣmadasmadbhyām bhyaso): the ablative affix bhyas which occurs after 
the bases yuṣmad and asmad is replaced with at. 
7.1.30 
yuṣmad / asmad + bhyas 
7.1.31 
yuṣmad / asmad + bhyas (ablative) 
Note that bhyas is a plural affix used for both dative and ablative forms. 7.1.31 is specifically 
about the ablative bhyas. This is a case of SOI-L. 7.1.73 is more specific because it mentions 
the ablative, and thus wins, leading to the correct form: yuṣmat.  
On 7.1.31, the Nyāsa says that 7.1.31 is an apavāda of, and thus wins against, 7.1.30. 
 
(8) eka + Ṅe – ‘one’ (masculine), dative singular 
eka + Ṅe 
 
                                                                7.1.13           7.1.14 

80 
 
7.1.13 ṅer yaḥ (ataḥ): the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a base ending in a, is replaced with 
ya. 
7.1.14 sarvanāmnaḥ smai (ṅer yaḥ ataḥ)59: the affix Ṅe, when occurring after a pronominal 
base ending in a, is replaced with smai. 
7.1.13  
a + Ṅe  
7.1.14 
a (pronoun) + Ṅe   
This is a case of SOI-L. 7.1.14 concerns only pronominal bases. Thus, it is more specific and 
wins, leading to the correct form: ekasmai. 
To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would 
use the apavāda tool to solve it.  
 
(9) hari + au – ‘green’ (masculine) nominative dual 
hari  +  au 
The two rules that are applicable here are: 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (vowel) follows. 
6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ (aci akaḥ dīrghaḥ): aK (a, i, u, r̥ , l̥) and the following 
vowel which constitutes the first sound of nominative and accusative affixes, are both replaced 
with a long vowel which is homogeneous with the sound on the left-hand side. 
Note that, here too, like in example 5 of this section, the operand of one rule is inside the 
operand of another. We overcome this problem just as we did in example 5.  
6.1.77  
i / u/ r̥  / l̥ + any vowel 
 
 
59 The base eka is listed in the sarvādigaṇa, referred to in 1.1.27 sarvādīni sarvanāmāni. 

81 
 
6.1.102 
a + any vowel (nominative / accusative) 
i / u/ r̥  / l̥ + any vowel (nominative / accusative) 
 This is a case of SOI-L. 6.1.102 is more specific and thus wins, leading to the correct form: 
harī. 
To the best of my knowledge the tradition does not mention this conflict. I suppose it would 
use its interpretation of 1.4.2 to solve it.   
  
(10) vāri + Ṅi – ‘water (neuter)’ locative singular 
Let us look at the rules that apply: 
7.3.116 ṅer ām nadyāmnībhyaḥ 
7.3.117 idudbhyām 
7.3.118 aut 
7.3.119 ac ca gheḥ 
Kielhorn60 shows that 7.3.117-7.3.119 together originally constituted one sūtra: idudbhyām 
aud ac ca gheḥ. Kātyāyana split it into two: idudbhyām and aud ac ca gheh, and Patañjali 
further split the latter into two: aut and ac ca gheḥ. I accept the original version taught by Pāṇini 
himself: 7.3.117 idudbhyām aud ac ca gheḥ.  
Now, in vāri + Ṅi, two rules are applicable: 
                                               vāri                                 +                       Ṅi 
                                                          
                                             7.3.117            7.1.73                             7.3.117 
7.1.73 iko’ci vibhaktau (num napuṁsakasya): augment nUM is attached to a neuter iK-final 
(ending in i, u, r̥ , l) base when a vowel-initial declensional affix follows.’  
 
60 See Staal’s ‘A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians’ (1972: 115). 

82 
 
7.3.117 idudbhyām aut ac ca gheḥ (ṅer): after ghi bases, Ṅi is replaced with au, and the final 
sound of the base is replaced with a.  
Note that 7.3.117 is unusual because it teaches two operations together. And curiously, we can 
say that the operand of 7.1.73 lies between the two operands of 7.3.117. We cannot treat this 
as a case of DOI, so we have to treat this as a case of SOI. 
7.1.73 applies to: 
i/u (neuter) + Ṅi  
i/u (neuter) + other vowel initial affixes  
r̥ /l̥  (neuter) + vowel initial affixes  
7.3.117 applies to: 
i/u + Ṅi 
This is a case of SOI-L and the condition which is marked ‘neuter’ is more specific and thus 
wins, giving us the correct form vāriṇi.   
The tradition uses the vārttika, guṇavr̥ ddhyauttvatr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham 
(vt. 1061 on 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca), to solve this conflict. This vārttika teaches that even though the 
rule teaching the attachment of the augment nUM (7.1.73) comes before the rule teaching 
auttva (7.3.117 idudbhyām aud ac ca gheḥ) in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the former 
wins.

Chapter Three 
3.1 Challenges1  
In the previous chapter, I introduced my solution to the problem of rule interaction at the same 
step. In this chapter, I will discuss the relationship of my solution with other aspects of the 
functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 
Let us look at two examples of DOI from nominal inflection which pose a challenge to my 
interpretation of 1.4.2. In these two cases, it can be argued that the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s derivational 
machine does not follow its own algorithm.2 
Like in the previous chapter, I will first prove that the example involves conflict, given the 
interest of the post-Pāṇinian discourse in the subject of conflict, and will also discuss both my 
solution and the traditional solution thereafter. 
(1) tri + ām – ‘three’ (masculine), genitive plural 
tri     +      ām 
 
                                                            7.1.53        7.1.54 
7.1.53 tres trayaḥ:  tri is replaced with traya when ām follows. 
7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ: augment nUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a base 
which ends in a short vowel (hrasvānta), or in a form which is termed nadī (nadyanta), or else, 
ends in the feminine affix āP (ābanta).  
If we apply 7.1.53 at this step, we get traya + ām, to which 7.1.54 will be applicable. If we 
apply 7.1.54 at this step, we get tri + nām, to which 7.1.53 will not be applicable. This is 
because 7.1.53 is applicable to tri if it is followed by ām, not nām.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).   
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.54 wins and we get: tri + nām (7.1.54)  
trīnām (6.4.3 nāmi)  *trīṇām (8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi), which is not the correct form.  
 
1 In this chapter, and in the following chapters, I will not provide anuvr̥ tta ‘continued’ terms in brackets 
(unless necessary), even though I did this in the previous chapters. 
2 These are the only two exceptions of my interpretation of 1.4.2 known to me. 

84 
 
To get the correct answer, we must apply 7.1.53 here: traya + ām (7.1.53)  traya + nām 
(7.1.54)  trayānām (6.4.3 nāmi)  trayāṇām (8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi).  
To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not say anything on this matter.  
As seen above, my interpretation of 1.4.2 does not give us the correct answer here. I have not 
found a convincing way to explain this phenomenon. However, below, I present a purely 
speculative and unsubstantiated explanation. Further research needs to be done to understand 
this issue better. 
We know that Pāṇini was familiar with the form trayāṇām because he uses it in his rule 7.4.75 
nijāṁ trayāṇāṁ guṇaḥ ślau “a guṇa vowel replaces the abhyāsa of a base constituted by the 
list of three roots beginning with nijIR ‘to cleanse, nourish’ when ŚLU follows”. However, he 
may also have been familiar with the form trīṇām: even though trīṇām is not to be found in 
classical Sanskrit, it is in fact used in Vedic Sanskrit: trīṇām api samudrāṇām ‘also of the three 
oceans’3. It is possible that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or at least its first layer of 
rules, both trīṇām and trayāṇām were acceptable as genitive plural form of tri (masculine) in 
bhāṣā ‘everyday Sanskrit’. So, even though he uses the form (trayāṇām) in his sūtra, perhaps 
he wanted to teach the derivation of the other acceptable form (trīṇām). 
In the course of time, as the language underwent further change, trīṇām got fully replaced with 
trayāṇām.4 And to accommodate this change, it is possible that a later scholar added the sūtra 
7.1.53 tres trayaḥ to the Aṣṭādhyāyī. This scholar may not have known the actual meaning of 
1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, which is perhaps why he did not realize that this would create 
a problem. 
In fact, we do find a very similar and related example of language change reflected in Pāṇini’s 
own rules. Consider the genitive plural of tri (feminine): tri + ām. As shown in example 2 of 
section 2.3, after performing some operations, we get tisr̥  + nām. Here, 6.4.3 nāmi, which 
teaches the elongation of r̥ , is not applicable, thanks to 6.4.4 na tisr̥ catasr̥ , which forbids us 
from applying 6.4.3 vis-à-vis tisr̥  and catasr̥ . However, the next rule 6.4.5 chandasy ubhayathā 
teaches that, when constructing the Vedic form, one can optionally elongate r̥  in the genitive 
 
3 This example has been given in the Kāśikā on 7.1.53. Another example is: mahi trīṇām avo’stu 
dyukṣam mitrasyāryamṇaḥ (Maṇḍala 10, Sūkta 185, R̥ k 1). 
4 Observe its similarity with trayaḥ, the nominative plural form of tri (masculine). It is likely that the 
presence of traya here rubbed off on the genitive plural. 

85 
 
plural of tri (feminine). This gives us two acceptable Vedic forms: tisr̥ ṇām and tisr̥̄ṇām. It is 
likely that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the older version, tisr̥̄ṇām was becoming 
obsolete and simultaneously making way for the newer version tisr̥ ṇām.  
Similarly, it seems plausible that, in order to register the change from trīṇām to trayāṇām in 
the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or put differently, to update the Aṣṭādhyāyī, someone added the sūtra 7.1.53 
tres trayaḥ to it. 7.1.53 tres trayaḥ must have been placed after 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ to 
continue āmi into 7.1.53 by anuvr̥ tti. But observe how oddly located it is – a substitution rule 
in the midst of augment insertion rules.

We also have another reason to believe that 7.1.53 might be an interpolation. Consider Pāṇini’s 
rule 6.4.3 nāmi (dīrghaḥ). If he had said āmi dīrghaḥ instead of nāmi dīrghaḥ, then in deva + 
ām, two rules would have been simultaneously applicable: 
deva          +            ām 
 
                                             āmi (dīrghaḥ)                     hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ 
Both rules would block each other. This is a Type 2a interaction (DOI conflict). By my 
interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule would win leading to rāmanām  *rāmaṇām (8.4.2 
aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi), which is not the correct form. It is for this reason that Pāṇini said 
nāmi and not āmi, thereby requiring us to add the nUṬ augment first and to lengthen the vowel 
after doing so. Since Pāṇini was careful enough about this derivation, he would also have been 
careful about the derivation of trayāṇām – that is, if he had wanted to derive this form – which 
also deals with ām and nuḍāgama. 
If Pāṇini had wanted to derive the word trayāṇām, I think he would have come up with a rule 
similar in style to 6.4.3 nāmi (dīrghaḥ): tres trayaḥ nāmi. The derivation would have proceeded 

86 
 
as follows: tri + ām  tri + nām (7.1.54 hrasvanadyāpo nuṭ). At this juncture there would 
arise an SOI conflict between 6.4.3 nāmi and tres trayaḥ nāmi. The latter would win by virtue 
of being more specific, and we would get the correct form: trayāṇām (8.4.2 
aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi). This suggests that Pāṇini may not be the composer of 7.1.53 tres 
trayaḥ. 
To conclude, as stated before, it is possible that when Pāṇini composed the Aṣṭādhyāyī, or at 
least its first layer of rules, both trīṇām and trayāṇām were acceptable as genitive plural form 
of tri (masculine) in bhāṣā ‘everyday Sanskrit’. It is possible that Pāṇini, despite using the form 
trayāṇām in his rule, taught us the derivation of trīṇām, while a later scholar added the rule 
7.1.53 tres trayaḥ to the Aṣṭādhyāyī to facilitate the derivation of trayāṇām.  
However, I admit it is odd that Pāṇini would use one form (trayāṇām) in his sūtra but would 
teach the derivation of the other acceptable form (trīṇām), therefore this matter will require 
further consideration.  
 
(2) bhavatU  +  sU – ‘Sir’ (masculine), nominative singular 
bhav         a            t   +   sU 
                                             
                                                                6.4.14   7.1.70     6.1.68 
6.4.14 atvasantasya cādhātoḥ: the vowel, which is the penultimate sound of a base which ends 
in atU or as but is not a verbal root, is replaced with its long counterpart when the non-
sambuddhi ending sU follows.  
7.1.70 ugidacāṁ sarvanāmasthāne’dhātoḥ: augment nUM is introduced to a base which is not 
a verbal root but is marked with UK (U, R̥ , L̥ ), and also to a base constituted by verbal root 
añcU, when an affix termed sarvanāmasthāna follows. 
6.1.68 halṅyābbhyo dīrghāt sutisyapr̥ ktaṁ hal: there is elision by LOPA of the finite verb 
affixes ti and si, when they consist of a single sound and follow a form which ends in a 
consonant, and of the nominative singular case affix sU, when it follows a form which ends in 
a consonant or the long final vowel of feminine affixes Ṅī or āP.  

87 
 
If we apply 6.1.68 at this step, both 6.4.14 and 7.1.70 will potentially be applicable at the 
following step, thanks to 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam5. Similarly, even after 6.4.14 
and 7.1.70 have been applied, the stem will still end in the consonant t, so 6.1.68 will be 
applicable at the following step. So, 6.1.68 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules, 
and thus shares a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict) relationship with them.  
Now let us look at the relationship between 6.4.14 and 7.1.70. If we apply 6.4.14 at this step, 
then 7.1.70 which introduces nUM after the last vowel, will still be applicable at the following 
step. But if we apply 7.1.70 at this step, then a will no longer be the penultimate sound and so 
6.4.14 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, 
and is classified as Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 6.1.68 and get: bhavat. At this step, 
thanks to 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, two rules are applicable: 
bhav        a                         t 
 
                                                                 6.4.14        7.1.70 
As seen above, there is a Type 2a (DOI conflict) relationship between them. By my 
interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.70 wins and we get bhavant. Here, 6.4.14 is not 
applicable. We apply 8.2.23 saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ which teaches LOPA deletion of the second 
consonant of a pada-final conjunct. This gives us *bhavan which is not the correct answer.6 
To get the correct answer, we have to apply 6.4.14 first, and then apply 7.1.70: bhavat + sU  
bhavat (6.1.68)  bhavāt (6.4.14)  bhavānt (7.1.70)  bhavān (8.2.23).  
The tradition too takes cognizance of this problem, because even the application of its own 
conflict resolution tools gives the wrong form. 7.1.70 is both nitya (the rule which 
unidirectionally blocks the other rule) and para (the rule which comes after the other rule in 
the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī) with respect to 6.4.14. And yet 6.4.14 has to prevail for us 
to get the correct answer. On 6.4.14 the Kāśikā says: atra kr̥ te dīrghe numāgamaḥ kartavyaḥ. 
yadi hi paratvān nityatvāc ca nuṁ syāt, dīrghasya nimittam atūpadhā vihanyeta ‘Here, the 
 
5 An operation conditioned by an affix applies even if the affix has been replaced with LOPA. 
6 Note that we cannot replace the penultimate a of bhavan at this stage with ā by 6.4.14 because 6.4.14 
treats 8.2.23 as asiddha and thus cannot see that t has been deleted by 8.2.23. So 6.4.14 still sees the 
form as bhavant, to which it cannot apply. 

88 
 
augment nUM should be inserted [only] after lengthening [the vowel]. If nUM wins, because 
it is para and nitya, then the cause of lengthening [namely] the status of a as the penultimate 
sound is finished.’ 
Returning to the topic at hand, this example too seems to invalidate my interpretation of 1.4.2. 
I have not found a fully satisfactory way to overcome this problem. Nonetheless, I present here, 
which I think might explain why this happens. Let us write down the group of rules to which 
6.4.14 belongs, along with those words (in box brackets) which are continued by anuvr̥ tti.

If a term A in rule number ‘n’ does not have an equivalent term B in rule number n+1, then A becomes anuvr̥ tta from rule n to n+1, if it is relevant 
in rule n+1.8 For example, inhanpūṣāryamṇām of 6.4.12 is the equivalent of aptr̥ ntr̥ csvasr̥ naptr̥ … of 6.4.11 so aptr̥ ntr̥ csvasr̥ naptr̥ … is not 
continued by anuvr̥ tti from 6.4.11 to 6.4.12. The phrase vā ṣapūrvasya nigame makes the concerned operation optional in a certain context and 
does not get continued into the following rules9. 
Note that cāsambuddhau ‘and not in vocative singular10’ which is anuvr̥ tta from 6.4.8 into 6.4.9, 6.4.10 and 6.4.11 does not become anuvr̥ tta in 
6.4.12 śau inhanpūṣāryamṇām because Śi is never seen in sambuddhi ‘vocative singular’ forms. So, it is irrelevant there and does not get continued 
into 6.4.12. The next rule is 6.4.13 sau ca, and we know that sU is added to bases to derive both vocative and non-vocative forms. cāsambuddhau 
is relevant in 6.4.13, because it can play the role of restricting 6.4.13 to only non-vocative cases of sU, and thus, gets anuvr̥ tta in 6.4.13. This is 
one of many examples in the Aṣṭādhyāyī in which a term displays what is called maṇḍukapluti ‘frog jump’, i.e., it becomes anuvr̥ tta from rule 
number ‘n’ to rule number ‘n+2’ without becoming anuvr̥ tta in rule number ‘n+1’, thereby jumping like a frog from one rule in which it is relevant 
to the next rule in which it is relevant, skipping, on its way, those rules in which it would be irrelevant.

Now let us look at saṁyogasya of 6.4.10. 
6.4.10 sāntamahataḥ saṁyogasya: a substitute long vowel replaces the short vowel that is 
penultimate with respect to a n which is part of a stem-final conjunct either ending in s or 
constituting part of the pre-affixal stem mahat- ‘great’ when a sarvanāmasthāna affix other 
than sambuddhi follows. 
saṁyogasya is not relevant in 6.4.11, 6.4.12 and 6.4.13 because those bases do not end in a 
saṁyoga ‘conjunct’. In the table above I have put ‘x’ marks under saṁyogasya to indicate this. 
What about 6.4.14? The tradition does not continue saṁyogasya into 6.4.14. However, I think 
that saṁyogasya is relevant in 6.4.14, so I propose to read saṁyogasya by anuvr̥ tti in 6.4.14 
(See ‘!!!’ sign). Like cāsambuddhau, saṁyogasya too displays the trait of maṇḍukapluti.  
 
Now 6.4.14 reads:  
6.4.14 atvasantasya cādhātoḥ (saṁyogasya sau cāsambuddhau dīrghaḥ upadhāyāḥ): a 
substitute long vowel replaces a short vowel that is penultimate with respect to the stem-final 
conjunct of a non-verbal stem ending in atU or with respect to the last sound of a non-verbal 
stem ending in as, when a non-sambuddhi ending sU follows. 
Note that saṁyogasya is only relevant to atU and not to as. Now, let us perform the derivation 
again, bearing this new meaning of 6.4.14 in mind: 
bhav           a              t            +          sU   
         
                                                                 7.1.70                         6.1.68 
Note that 6.4.14, as interpreted by me, is not applicable here because bhavat does not end in a 
conjunct. 7.1.70 and 6.1.68 do not block each other. This is a Type 2b (DOI non-conflict) 
interaction.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.68 and get bhavat. Now by 1.1.62 
pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam, 7.1.70 applies and we get bhavant. Since bhavant ends in a 
saṁyoga ‘conjunct’, my interpretation of 6.4.14 applies here: bhavānt. Finally, we apply 8.2.23 
saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ and get the correct form: bhavān.  
Admittedly, this is a weak explanation because, in order to facilitate the anuvr̥ tti of saṁyogasya 
in 1.4.14, I had to split the compound atvasantasya into two, the at part, which is compatible 
with saṁyogasya, and the vas part, which is not. Despite the helpful work done by Joshi and 

91 
 
Bhate (1983, 1984) on the subject of anuvr̥ tti, this is still a hitherto poorly understood topic. 
As of now, we do not have sufficient evidence suggesting that it is acceptable to split a samāsa 
in this manner to accommodate items continued by anuvr̥ tti. Further research needs to be done 
on this topic. 
 
3.2 DOI in the Inflection of Taddhita, Samāsa and Kr̥ danta Nominal Bases 
So far, we have looked at cases of DOI in the inflection of simple (i.e., underived) nominal 
bases (cf. 1.2.45 arthavad adhātur apratyayaḥ prātipadikam). Now let us look at some cases 
of DOI in the inflection of complex (i.e., derived) nominal bases such as kr̥ t ‘primary 
derivative’, taddhita ‘secondary derivative’, and samāsa ‘compound’ (cf. 1.2.46 
kr̥ ttaddhitasamāsāś ca). 
Generally speaking, as compared to the inflection of simple nominal bases, which we have 
seen in the previous chapter and in this chapter, and verbal inflection and primary derivatives, 
which we will see in the following chapters, we find a smaller number of examples of conflict 
in taddhita derivations, and even fewer examples in samāsa derivations. I will explain why this 
is the case towards the end of chapter 4.  
We will see that the tradition manages to avoid dealing with conflict in the first four examples. 
However, it has to rely on certain external (post-Pāṇinian) metarules to correctly derive these 
four forms. I will show that my solution for DOI (my interpretation of 1.4.2) can help us 
perform these derivations without relying on such external metarules. In the following four 
examples, we do find cases of conflict. Here too, I use my solution for DOI (cf. my 
interpretation of 1.4.2) to get the correct answer and also mention the traditional solution where 
it is known. 
(1) Consider the genitive singular form of prati-ac11 ‘turned towards, facing’: pratīcas. By 
2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ, prati-ac is a tatpuruṣa compound made of prati, which takes the 
technical designation gati by 1.4.60 gatiś ca and ac, which is derived as follows: añcU + KvIN 
 
11 I use the ‘+’ sign between a base and an affix. Since ac is not an affix with respect to prati, I put a ‘–
’ instead of a ‘+’ between prati and ac. 

92 
 
(3.2.59 r̥ tvigdadhr̥ ksragdiguṣṇigañcuyujikruñcāṁ ca12)  ac + v (6.4.24 aniditāṁ hala 
upadhāyāḥ kṅiti13)  ac (6.1.67 ver apr̥ ktasya14).  
The Siddhāntakaumudī (SK) completes all the operations within the base before adding the 
genitive singular affix Ṅas15: prati-ac (2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ)  pratyac (6.1.77 
iko yaṇ aci). If the derivation is stopped at the addition of the genitive affix Ṅas to pratyac, that 
does not give the correct answer: pratyac + Ṅas   *pratyacaḥ. 
The tradition has found a way to work around this. In pratyac + Ṅas, pratyac takes the 
designation bha by 1.4.18 because it is followed by a non-sarvanāmasthāna affix beginning 
with a vowel. Then, 6.4.138 acaḥ teaches that the a of verbal base ac (from añc), when 
designated as bha, is replaced with LOPA: pratyc + Ṅas. To get the correct form, it takes 
recourse to the metarule nimittābhāve naimittikasyāpy abhāvaḥ16, which teaches that when the 
cause of an operation is lost, the impact or effect of that operation too is lost. In other words, if 
X causes A to change to B, upon the deletion of X, B becomes A again. Thanks to this 
paribhāṣā, since the cause of the operation 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, namely a, has been deleted, the 
preceding y will go back to its original form i. Thus, we get pratic + Ṅas. At this step the 
tradition applies 6.3.138 cau, which teaches that, the final aṆ of the preceding pada in a 
compound is replaced with its dīrgha equivalent when c (from añc) follows. This gives the 
correct form: pratīcaḥ.  
Another Pāṇinian paribhāṣā, which makes this very argument in terms of antaraṅga and 
bahiraṅga operations, is cited by the Siddhāntakaumudī17 when discussing this derivation: 
akr̥ tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ ‘The Pāṇinīyas do not insist that a rule should take effect if its causes 
disappear’. Nāgeśa (Pbh 56, Paribhāṣenduśekhara), while discussing this paribhāṣā in 
antaraṅga and bahiraṅga terms, says: bahiraṅgeṇāntaraṅgasya nimittavināśe paścāt 
 
12 Among other things, this rule teaches that KvIN occurs after the root añcU ‘to bend’ when this root 
co-occurs with a pada ending in sUP. 
13 LOPA replaces the penultimate n of a verbal base ending in a consonant and not marked with I [in 
the Dhātupāṭha] when an affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
14 Affix vI unaccompanied [by any other sound] is replaced with LOPA. 
15 We know this because of a paribhāṣā it mentions, will I will discuss below.  
16 Another version of this, which we occasionally find in paribhāṣā texts, is nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy 
apāyaḥ. 
17 SK 417 (6.3.138 cau). 

93 
 
sambhāvite antaraṅgaṁ neti yāvat ‘An antaraṅga operation (here, 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci) should 
not be undertaken if its cause would disappear later due to the bahiraṅga operation (here, 
6.4.138 acaḥ)’. 
These two paribhāṣās require one to go a step back into the derivation and undo a previous 
operation. This runs contrary to the idea that derivations should move in one direction, and that 
each operation should take us one step forward (rather than backward) into the derivation. 
Besides, if Pāṇini wanted us to use these metarules, he would have taught them explicitly in 
the Aṣṭādhyāyī. For these reasons, I do not accept these two paribhāṣās. Now I will derive this 
form using my method. Two rules are simultaneously applicable to prati - ac: 
                                                               prati    -     ac 
 
                                                              6.1.77                         4.1.2 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup18 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (vowel) follows. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get prati 
- ac + Ṅas. Here two rules are applicable: 
              prati    -    ac    +   Ṅas 
 
                                                              6.1.77       6.4.138    
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 
6.4.138 acaḥ: the a of ac which has taken the technical designation bha is replaced with LOPA. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.4.138 wins, and we get: 
praticaḥ  pratīcaḥ (6.3.138 cau), which is the correct form. 
 
 
 
18 This rule teaches all the declensional affixes. The affix that is applicable here is the genitive singular 
Ṅas. 

94 
 
(2) Let us derive the genitive singular of the perfect participle of sad ‘to sit’, namely sad + vas 
‘one who had sat’. The Siddhāntakaumudī attaches the declensional affix Ṅas to the base only 
after the base is fully ready.19 The base is derived by replacing LIṬ with KvasU: sad + LIṬ  
sad + KvasU (3.2.108 bhāṣāyāṁ sadavasaśruvaḥ20). Now, (i) by 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor 
anabhyāsasya, (which teaches that the un-reduplicated root undergoes reduplication when 
followed by LIṬ), (ii) by 6.1.1 ekāco dve prathamasya (which teaches that the first syllable of 
the root undergoes reduplication) and (iii) by 1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau (which teaches 
that the substitute should be treated like the substituendum except when an operation relative 
to the original sound is to be performed), we get sadsad + vas. By 7.4.60 halādiḥ śeṣaḥ, which 
teaches that all but the first consonant of the abhyāsa (first half of sadsad) are deleted, we get 
sasad + vas. Now, by 6.4.120 ata ekahalmadhye’nādeśāder liṭi21, we get sed + vas. At this 
point, 7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām is applicable, which, according to the tradition22, teaches that 
the augment iṬ should be attached to vasU when it occurs after a root which, after doubling, 
consists of a single syllable, or a root ending in ā, or ghas ‘to eat’. By applying this rule, we 
get the base sedivas, but, if at the next step we add the genitive singular affix Ṅas, we get 
*sedivasaḥ, which is the incorrect answer. 
Here, again, the tradition uses the two paribhāṣās discussed above to circumvent this problem. 
In sedivas + Ṅas, sedivas takes the designation bha because it is followed by a non-
sarvanāmasthāna affix beginning with a vowel (cf. 1.4.18 yaci bham). To this, the tradition 
applies 6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam, which teaches that the semivowel of the affix vasU in 
an item termed bha is replaced with the corresponding vowel u. This gives sediuas, and the 
augment i in sedivas, which is attached to vas by 7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām, is lost, because its 
cause v no longer exists (cf. akr̥ tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ and nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ). 
Then, the a of seduas is deleted by 6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca which teaches that both the 
 
19 We know this because of the use of the paribhāṣā, akr̥ tavyūhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ on SK 435 (6.4.131 vasoḥ 
samprasāraṇam). I will discuss this later in the example. 
20 The affix LIṬ is optionally replaced with KvasU in classical Sanskrit after the roots sadA ‘to sit’, 
vasA ‘to inhabit’ and śru ‘to listen’ when the action has taken place in the past. 
21 An a, which occurs in between two single consonants of a verbal base whose initial sound has not 
undergone replacement, is replaced with e, when a LIṬ affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. In such cases, 
the abhyāsa (i.e., the first of the two reduplicated syllables) is also deleted.  
22 I interpret this rule differently. I will discuss my interpretation later in this example.  

95 
 
samprasāraṇa replacement and the vowel following it are together replaced with the former. 
This gives us sedus + Ṅas  seduṣaḥ, which is the correct form. 
Again, like in the previous example, I reject the use of these two anitya paribhāṣās. I perform 
this derivation as follows. I add the affix LIṬ to sad by the following rule: 
3.2.115 parokṣe liṭ: affix LIṬ occurs after a verbal root when an unwitnessed (parokṣa) action 
which is not current (anadyatana) is denoted in the past (bhūta). 
Then, the following rules become applicable:  
                                                          sad      +      LIṬ             
 
                                                           6.1.8       3.2.108              
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: an un-reduplicated root undergoes reduplication when followed 
by LIṬ.23 
3.2.108 bhāṣāyāṁ sadavasaśruvaḥ: the affix LIṬ is optionally replaced with KvasU in classical 
Sanskrit after the roots sadA ‘to sit’, vasA ‘to inhabit’ and śru ‘to listen’ when the action has 
taken place in the past. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 3.2.108 wins and we get sad 
+ vas. Multiple rules are applicable here: 
                                                          sad      +       vas             
 
                                                           6.1.8          7.2.67             4.1.2 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām: (my interpretation) augment iṬ is introduced to vasU when it 
occurs after a root which either consists of a single syllable, or ends in a, or else, is 
constituted by ghas ‘to eat’.24 
 
23 Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 
ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 
24 The tradition interprets this rule as follows: augment iṬ is introduced to vasU when it occurs after a 
root which, after doubling, either consists of a single syllable, or ends in a, or else, is constituted by 
ghas ‘to eat’. Note that Pāṇini does not say ‘after doubling’ anywhere in his rule, and ‘after doubling’ 

96 
 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup25 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 wins and we get 
sad + vas + Ṅas. Multiple rules are applicable here: 
                                                sad        +      vas         +        Ṅas 
 
                                               6.1.8    6.4.131       7.2.67 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
7.2.67 vasv ekājādghasām: same as above. 
6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam: vasU of an item termed bha undergoes samprasāraṇa.26 
There is an SOI between 6.4.131 and 7.2.67. Let us find out which rule is more specific. 
6.4.131: 
monosyllabic root / ākārānta root / ghas + vas (termed bha)  
other bases + vas (termed bha) 
7.2.67  
monosyllabic root / ākārānta root / ghas + vas 
The conditions highlighted in bold are relevant to this SOI. Since 6.4.131 has been taught 
specifically for a bha-saṁjñaka vas, it is more specific and thus wins.  
Now let us consider the DOI relationship between 6.1.8 and 6.4.131. By my interpretation of 
1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.4.131 wins and we get: sad + uas + Ṅas. Here, again, two rules are 
applicable: 
 
 
 
cannot be inferred by anuvr̥ tti either. The tradition takes the liberty to read this phrase into this rule 
purely on the basis of certain derivational considerations. I do not think we should make such 
assumptions and therefore I do not include ‘after doubling’ in my interpretation. 
25 1.2.46 kr̥ ttaddhitasamāsāś ca. 
26 1.4.18 yaci bham. 

97 
 
sad         +       uas         +        Ṅas 
 
                                             6.1.8                6.1.108 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca: both the samprasāraṇa replacement and the vowel following it are 
together replaced with the former.  
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.1.108 wins and we get sad 
+ us + Ṅas. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows:  sadsad + us + Ṅas (6.1.8 liṭi dhātor 
anabhyāsasya)  seduṣaḥ (6.4.120 ata ekahalmadhye’nādeśāder liṭi), which is the correct 
form. 
 
(3) Let us derive the nominative plural of ‘descendant of garga’, first through the traditional 
method and then through mine.  
The tradition27 adds the declensional affix only after the base is ready. As per the traditional 
method, we first add the affix yaÑ to garga + Ṅas by 4.1.105 gargādibhyo yañ28; then by 2.4.71 
supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ29, Ṅas is deleted, which gives us garga + yaÑ. At this juncture, 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ prescribes the vr̥ ddhi substitution of the first vowel of garga 
given that the following affix is marked with Ñ. Thus, we get gārga + yaÑ. The a of gārga is 
deleted by 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, which teaches that the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when 
it is followed by ī or a taddhita affix. Thus, we get our base gārgya. 
At this point, the tradition prescribes the addition of the affix Jas to the base gārgya: gārgya + 
Jas. This leads to the application of 2.4.64 yañañōś ca, which teaches that the gotra affixes 
yaÑ and aÑ are replaced with LUK when the following declensional affix denotes plural, except 
when the base is feminine. Stopping here gives us the incorrect form: *gārgaḥ.  
 
27 I give a reference later in the example. 
28 The taddhita affix yaÑ is added to the syntactically related genitive form of any base included in the 
list starting with garga to construct a form which means gotra-descendant of that individual. 
29 A suP undergoes LUK deletion when it occurs inside a dhātu ‘verbal base’ or a prātipadika ‘nominal 
base’. 

98 
 
On 2.4.64, the Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī suggests the metarule, 
nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ, which we have discussed in the previous two examples, 
to solve this problem: because yaÑ is deleted, the vr̥ ddhi of the first vowel (cf. 7.2.117) and the 
deletion of the final a (6.4.148), which were caused by yaÑ, also must be undone, thereby 
giving us the correct form: garga + Jas  gargāḥ. However, I do not accept this metarule, as 
stated above. I perform this derivation as follows. Upon adding the affix yaÑ to garga, the 
following rules are applicable: 
                                          g    a     rg     a     +     yaÑ         
 
                                          7.2.117    6.4.148                                 4.1.2 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: the first vowel of the base undergoes vr̥ ddhi when an affix 
marked with Ñ or Ṇ follows in taddhita derivations. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when it is followed by ī or a taddhita 
affix. 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup  
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we 
get gargya + yaÑ + Jas. Here multiple rules are applicable: 
                                    [     g    a     rg     a     +     yaÑ    ]     +      Jas 
 
                                          7.2.117    6.4.148      2.4.64  
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 
2.4.64 yañañoś ca: LUK replaces the gotra affixes yaÑ and aÑ introduced after a nominal stem 
when that nominal stem ending in these affixes itself denotes plurality and is not followed by 
a feminine affix.  
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 2.4.64 and 
get: garga + Jas  gargāḥ (6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ30), which is the correct form.  
 
30 The a, i or u at the end of the base and the following vowel, which constitutes the first sound of 
nominative and accusative affixes, are together replaced with the long equivalent of the former. 

99 
 
Note that, at this point, 7.2.117 and 6.4.148 no longer have a chance to apply. So, unlike the 
traditional solution, mine does not require us to go backwards to undo the application of rules 
like 7.2.117 and 6.4.148. Therefore, my solution is more acceptable than the one provided by 
the tradition.  
 
(4) Now let us derive the nominative plural of ‘a kṣatriya descendent of the country of the 
pañcālas’ first through the traditional method, and then through mine. The tradition first 
derives the base and then adds the declensional affix at the end. Consider the following rule: 
4.1.168 janapadaśabdāt kṣatriyād añ: the taddhita affix aÑ is added to a syntactically related 
base ending in the genitive which stands for both a janapada and its class of kṣatriyas, in order 
to denote the sense of apatya ‘descendent’. 
The tradition31 starts by adding the affix aÑ to pañcāla + ām by 4.1.168: [pañcāla + ām] + 
aÑ. ām is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. At this juncture, 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv 
acām ādeḥ teaches that the first vowel of pañcāla undergoes vr̥ ddhi given that the following 
affix is marked with Ñ. Upon applying this rule, we get: pāñcāla + aÑ. The a of pāñcāla is 
deleted by 6.4.148 which teaches that the final i or a of a bha item is deleted when it is followed 
by ī or a taddhita affix. Thus, we get our base pāñcāla. 
At this point, the tradition prescribes the addition of the affix Jas to the base pāñcāla: pāñcāla 
+ Jas. By 4.1.174 te tadrājāḥ, the taddhita affixes, including aÑ, which occur after a 
syntactically related genitive to indicate a ‘kṣatriya descendent of the kṣatriyas of a janapada’ 
take the technical designation tadrāja. Thus 2.4.62 tadrājasya bahuṣu tenaivāstriyām becomes 
applicable here: it teaches that LUK replaces a tadrāja affix introduced after a nominal stem 
when it denotes plurality if that plurality is expressed by the stem ending in that affix except 
when followed by a feminine affix. 
If the derivation stops here, we get pāñcāl + Jas  *pāñcālaḥ, which is not the correct answer. 
On 2.4.62, the Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī suggests the metarule 
nimittāpāye naimittikasyāpy apāyaḥ, which we have discussed above, to solve this problem: 
because aÑ is deleted, the vr̥ ddhi of the first vowel (cf. 7.2.117) and the deletion of the final a 
(6.4.148), which were caused by aÑ, also must be undone, thereby giving us the correct form: 
 
31 I give a reference later in the example. 

100 
 
pañcāla + Jas  pañcālāḥ. However, I do not accept this metarule, as stated above. I perform 
this derivation as follows. 
                                           [    p     a   ñcāl   a    +    aÑ   ]     
 
                                              7.2.117       6.4.148                         4.1.2 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we 
get pañcāla + aÑ + Jas. Here multiple rules are applicable: 
[    p     a   ñcāl   a    +    aÑ   ]    +    Jas 
 
                                             7.2.117       6.4.148     2.4.62 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 
2.4.62 tadrājasya bahuṣu tenaivāstriyām: same as above. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 2.4.62 wins and we 
get: pañcāla + Jas  pañcālāḥ (6.1.102 prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ) which is the correct 
form. As in the previous example, at this point 7.2.117 and 6.4.148 can no longer apply. This 
shows that my solution is better than the traditional one.  
 
(5) Now let us derive the nominative plural of ‘the student of gārgya’, or in other words, the 
student of the descendent of garga’. To derive this form, cha is added to [gārgya + Ṅas] by 
the following rule:  
4.2.114 vr̥ ddhāt chaḥ: affix cha is added to a syntactically related item termed vr̥ ddha (cf. 
1.1.73 vr̥ ddhir yasyācām ādis tad vr̥ ddham) in the remaining senses. 

101 
 
In gārgya + Ṅas + cha, Ṅas is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ and we get gārgya 
+ cha.32 Let us look at my solution first. I will only highlight the cases of conflict here. The 
following rules are applicable: 
                                             [  gārgya          +      cha  ]      
                                                                
                                                                              7.1.2             4.1.2  
7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām: the sounds ph, ḍh, kh, ch and gh, 
when occurring at the beginning of the affix, are replaced with āyan, ey, īn, īy and iy 
respectively.  
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup  
The two rules do not block each other.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get: gārgya + cha + Jas. Here, 
multiple rules are applicable: 
 [  gārgya          +      cha  ]     +    Jas 
                                                                
                                                        2.4.64           7.1.2 
7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām: same as above. 
2.4.64 yañañoś ca: LUK replaces the gotra affixes yaÑ and aÑ introduced after a nominal stem 
when that nominal stem ending in these affixes itself denotes plurality and is not followed by 
a feminine affix.  
If we apply 2.4.64 at this step, 7.1.2 will be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.1.2 
at this step, thereby replacing ch of cha with īy (which gives us gārgya + īya), then 4.1.89 
gotre’lug aci comes into play: 
 
32 Note that, in all the derivations that I have performed using my method in this chapter, I apply 2.4.71 
supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ before actually starting the derivation. I do this to avoid making the 
derivations unnecessarily lengthy and to avoid monotony. I take this liberty because the correctness of 
the form we get at the end of the derivation does not depend on the step at which we apply 2.4.71. 
Ideally, one should apply this rule only when it ought to be applied.  

102 
 
4.1.89 gotre’lug aci: LUK does not replace a taddhita affix denoting a gotra descendant, when 
the following affix begins with a vowel and is introduced in the prāgdīvyatīya section33. 
Therefore, 2.4.64, which teaches LUK, will not be applicable at the following step. 7.1.2 blocks 
2.4.64. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.2 wins and we get gārgya + īya + Jas. Here by 
applying 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, we get gārgy + īya + Jas. At this stage, 6.4.151 applies: 
6.4.151 āpatyasya ca taddhite’nāti: a y which occurs after a consonant and is part of a taddhita 
affix signifying an apatya ‘off-spring’ which is in turn part of an item termed bha, is replaced 
with LOPA, when a taddhita affix not beginning with a, follows. 
This gives us the correct form: gārgīyāḥ. 
Even though Patañjali does discuss this derivation in his commentary on vt. 234 on 4.1.89 
gotre’lug aci, he does not discuss this conflict.35  
 
(6) Let us now derive the nominative singular of puṣya ‘a moon (which is) in conjunction with 
the constellation Puṣya’ of the sentence adya puṣyaḥ ‘today the moon is in conjunction with 
constellation puṣya. We start by adding the affix aṆ to puṣya + Ṭā by 4.2.3: 
4.2.3 nakṣatreṇa yuktaḥ kālaḥ: the taddhita affix aṆ is introduced after a nominal form which 
signifies a particular constellation (nakṣatra) and ends in tr̥ tīyā ‘instrumental’, to denote the 
time when the moon is in conjunction with that constellation. 
By 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, Ṭā is deleted, leading to puṣya + aṆ. Here, the following 
rules are applicable: 
                                                   [     p     u    ṣy    a  +   aṆ    ]      
 
                                                       7.2.117    6.4.148    4.2.4     4.1.2 
 
33 4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ - 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam. 
34 Mbh II.240.14. 
35 He focuses on the question: should the ya of gārgya be deleted by 2.4.64 yañañoś ca before a plural 
declensional affix is introduced to the derivation? I think this question is invalid because, in my view, 
2.4.64 should only apply to a base when a plural affix is present.   

103 
 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 
4.2.4 lub aviśeṣe: a taddhita affix introduced after a nominal stem ending in tr̥ tīyā and denoting 
a constellation is replaced with LUP when the time of conjunction is not qualified with 
specifications.36 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 
Let us look at the relationship of 4.2.4 with the two rules 6.4.148 and 7.2.117. If we apply 4.2.4 
at this step, thereby deleting the affix which triggers rules 7.2.117 and 6.4.148, neither of these 
two rules will be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply any of these two rules 
at this step, 4.2.4 will still be applicable at the following step. So, 4.2.4 unidirectionally blocks 
6.4.148 and 7.2.117 and is thus in conflict with both of them.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.1.2 applies and we get puṣya + aṆ + sU. 
Here multiple rules are applicable: 
                                                   [     p     u    ṣy    a  +   aṆ    ]  +   sU    
 
                                                       7.2.117    6.4.148    4.2.4        
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the right-most rule 4.2.4 applies and we get: puṣya + sU  
puṣyaḥ, which is the correct form. 
The Bhaimī commentary on the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī does not mention this conflict. 
However, after applying 4.2.4 at this step, it does say that by 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya, 7.2.117 
and 6.4.148 fail to apply at the following step.   
 
 
 
 
 
36 Note that our sentence is adya puṣyaḥ wherein the time mentioned is adya which is not specific 
(unlike for example, rātri, which is specific); thus 4.2.4 is applicable here.  

104 
 
(7) Let us now derive the nominative singular form of ‘fifth’. We add ḌaṬ to pañcan + Ṅas 
by the following rule: 
5.2.48 tasya pūraṇe ḍaṭ: the taddhita affix ḌaṬ occurs to denote the sense of pūraṇa ‘that by 
which something is brought to completion, ordinal number’ after a syntactically related 
nominal stem which signifies number and ends in ṣaṣṭhī ‘genitive’. 
In pañcan + Ṅas + ḌaṬ, Ṅas is deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, so we get pañcan 
+ ḌaṬ. Thereafter, the following rules become applicable: 
                                       [      pañc       an    +      ḌaṬ     ]           
 
                                                        6.4.143      5.2.49                     4.1.2     
6.4.143 ṭeḥ: the ṭi (cf. 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi) of an item termed bha is replaced with LOPA when 
an affix marked with Ḍ follows.  
5.2.49 nāntād asaṁkhyāder maṭ: the augment mAṬ is attached to the taddhita affix ḌaṬ when 
used to denote its ordinal, after a n-final nominal stem which ends in ṣaṣṭhī ‘genitive’ and does 
not have a number as its initial constituent. 
4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup 
4.1.2 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules.  
Now let us look at the relationship between 5.2.49 and 6.4.143. If we apply 5.2.49 at this step, 
then ḌaṬ will take the augment mAṬ. As a result, it will begin with a consonant. This implies 
that pañcan is no longer followed by an affix beginning with a vowel or y, and therefore it 
cannot be called bha. Thus, 6.4.143, which applies only to items termed bha, will not be 
applicable to an at the following step.  
If we apply 6.4.143 at this step, an gets deleted, so ḌaṬ will no longer be preceded by an item 
ending in n. Therefore, 5.2.49 will not be applicable at the following step.  
Both rules block each other. This is a case of mutual blocking, and of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 4.1.2 and get pañcan + ḌaṬ + sU. 
Here two rules are applicable: 
 
 

105 
 
                                       [      pañc       an    +      ḌaṬ     ]      +      sU     
 
                                                        6.4.143      5.2.49      
6.4.143 ṭeḥ: same as above. 
5.2.49 nāntād asaṁkhyāder maṭ: same as above. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 5.2.49 and get: 
pañcan + ma + sU. By 1.4.17 svādiṣv asarvanāmasthāne37, pañcan takes the technical 
designation pada, and so by 8.2.7 nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya, the n of pañcan gets deleted. 
Thus, we get the correct form: pañcamaḥ. 
On 5.2.49, Nyāsa says that 5.2.49 is antaraṅga with respect to 6.4.143 and thus wins.  
 
(8) Let us now look at the derivation of kālimmanyā ‘a woman who considers herself to be 
Kālī’. This is the feminine version of the upapada compound made of the two padas kālī and 
manya. manya is derived by adding KHaŚ to the verbal root man ‘to consider’ by the following 
rule:  
3.2.83 ātmamāne khaś ca: affixes KHaŚ and ṆinI are added to the verbal root man when the 
root co-occurs with a pada which ends in a sUP and the derivate denotes ātmamāna ‘thinking 
about one’s own self’.  
Now, because KHaŚ is marked with Ś, it is a sārvadhātuka affix by 3.4.113 tiṅśit 
sārvadhātukam. Here, 3.1.69 divādibhyaḥ ŚyaN instructs us to add the affix ŚyaN between the 
root man, which belongs to the fourth class of verbal roots, and KHaŚ, which is a sārvadhātuka 
affix used in the active sense. This gives us manya + a. By 6.1.97 ato guṇe, both a and the 
guṇa sound following it are replaced with the latter. This gives us manya.  
 
37 A form is termed pada when a svādi (affixes enumerated under 4.1.2 svaujas... through 5.4.151 uraḥ 
prabhr̥ tibhyaḥ kap) affix which is not a sarvanāmasthāna (sU, au, Jas, am, auṬ; see 4.1.2 svaujas...) 
follows. 

106 
 
Now let us build the compound: [kālī Ṅas manya]38. By 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, Ṅas 
is deleted. Here two rules are simultaneously applicable:  
                                                kāl          ī                  -                     manya 
 
                                                      6.3.66        6.3.67 
6.3.66 khity anavyayasya: the final vowel of the first member of a compound, except 
indeclinables, is replaced with a short vowel, when a constituent marked with KH combines to 
follow. 
6.3.67 arurdviṣadajantasya mum: augment mUM is introduced to arus, dviṣat and word ending 
in a vowel, except indeclinables, when a constituent marked with KH combines to follow. 
If we apply 6.3.66 at this step, 6.3.67 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
6.3.67 at this step, ī will no longer be the final sound of the pūrvapada. Thus, 6.3.66 will not 
be applicable at the following step.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of Type 2a (DOI conflict).  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 6.3.67 wins, and we get: *kālīmmanya, which is 
the wrong form. To get the correct form, we first need to apply 6.3.66, thereby shortening ī or 
kālī, and only then introduce the augment mUM, which gives us the correct form: kālimmanya. 
After this we add the feminine affix ṬāP by 4.1.4 ajādyataṣ ṭāp to get kālimmanyā.  
On this topic, the Kāśikā says: mumā hrasvo na bādhyate, anyathā hi hrasvaśāsanam 
anarthakaṁ syāt ‘shortening is not blocked by the mUM. Otherwise, the instruction about 
shortening would be futile’.  
Coming back to the problem, how do we explain this anomaly?  Notice that these rules have 
been taught one after another. Let us look at them along with words that have been continued 
into them by anuvr̥ tti. 
6.3.66 khity  anavyayasya (uttarapade   hrasvaḥ) 
6.3.67 (khity  anavyayasya uttarapade)                arurdviṣadajantasya mum 
 
38 One could argue that this should be [kālī am manya]. For a detailed discussion on this topic, see 
Scharf (2016).  

107 
 
While the tradition continues khity, anavyayasya and uttarapade from 6.3.66 into 6.3.67 by 
anuvr̥ tti, it does not continue hrasvaḥ into 6.3.67 by anuvr̥ tti. I think that Pāṇini intended for 
hrasvaḥ too to be continued into 6.3.67 by anuvr̥ tti. To facilitate its case agreement with 
anavyayasya, hrasvaḥ should be read not in the nominative but instead in the genitive, as 
hrasvasya, in 6.3.67. This gives us the following meaning of 6.3.67: ‘augment mUM is 
introduced to arus, dviṣat and a word ending in a short vowel, except indeclinables, when a 
constituent marked with KH combines to follow.’ 
Let us see how the derivation proceeds if we accept my interpretation of 6.3.67. At the step kālī 
- manya, only 6.3.66 is applicable. Upon its application, we get: kāli - manya. Now, 6.3.67 
applies and we get kālimmanya. Upon adding the feminine affix ṬāP, we get the correct form: 
kālimmanyā. 
 
3.3 SOI in Taddhita derivations 
The cases of SOI which we find in samāsa derivations are few and fairly simple. I will not be 
discussing them in this thesis. In taddhita derivations, we come across examples of SOI 
between rules teaching affixation. Consider the derivation of autsa ‘male offspring of utsa’ (cf. 
4.1.92 tasyāpatyam ‘his offspring’). Three rules teach the addition of three different affixes: 
4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ: the taddhita affix aṆ is added to denote senses taught in rules from here 
up to 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam. 
4.1.86 utsādibhyo’ñ: the taddhita affix aÑ is added to denote senses taught in rules from here 
up to 4.4.2 tena dīvyati khanati jayati jitam after forms of stem belonging to the list headed by 
utsa. 
4.1.95 ata iñ: the taddhita affix iÑ is added to denote ‘his offspring’ after forms of nominal 
stems ending in a.  
Now let us write down the conditions in which these rules apply. Remember that, as always, 
we write the sounds outside brackets and their characteristics inside brackets.  
 
 
 

108 
 
4.1.83  
-ending in a  
-ending in any other sound  
4.1.86  
-ending in a (utsādi class) 
-ending in any other sound (utsādi class) 
4.1.95 
-ending in a  
Upon comparing the conditions written in bold, we see that 4.1.86 is more specific that the 
other two rules, on account of the condition ‘utsādi class’. We get the correct form: [utsa + 
Ṅas] + aÑ  autsa ‘offspring of utsa’ (2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv 
acām ādeḥ, 6.4.148 yasyeti ca).  
On 4.1.86, the Kāśikā says aṇas tadapavādānāṁ ca bādhakaḥ, implying that this rule is an 
exception of both 4.1.83 and exceptions of 4.1.83 such as 4.1.95. 
The other examples in the taddhita section are quite similar to this one, so we shall not look at 
them.39  
This brings us to the end of this chapter, and also to the end of our study of examples of conflict 
from sandhi, subanta, taddhita and samāsa derivations. In the following chapter, we shall look 
at examples from tiṅanta and kr̥ danta derivations.   
 
39 For a detailed study, see Deo (2007).   
 

109 
 
Chapter Four 
4.1 Aṅgādhikāra 
Before I examine examples of rule interaction at the same step in tiṄ and kr̥ t derivations, I will 
examine rules 6.4.1 aṅgasya and 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam which 
play a pivotal role in running Pāṇini’s grammatical machine. 
6.4.1 aṅgasya is an adhikāra (heading) sūtra, the jurisdiction of which continues all the way 
up to the end of 7.4. Pāṇini defines the term aṅga in 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi 
pratyaye’ṅgam. Sharma translates this as follows: ‘a form beginning with that after which an 
affix is introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows’. 
I think that the tradition has not correctly understood these rules, as a result of which it faces 
multiple problems in performing certain derivations. In this section, I will present my 
interpretations of these rules, and show how my interpretations enable us to perform these 
derivations correctly. 
In my opinion, only one item can be called an aṅga with respect to a certain pratyaya in a 
derivation. I must admit that I am unable to support this statement using Pāṇini’s rules. 
However, through the examples discussed in section 4.2 of this chapter, I will show that it is 
not possible to correctly perform certain derivations without accepting this assumption. 
Let me discuss an example from verbal inflection to explain what I mean. Consider the 
derivation of the present-tense third-person singular form of cit ‘to think’: cit + LAṬ (3.2.123 
vartamāne laṭ1)  cit + tiP (3.4.77 lasya, 3.4.78 tiptasjhi…2). According to the tradition3, cit 
is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Then, after we add the vikaraṇa ŚaP by 3.1.68 kartari śap4, we 
get cit + ŚaP + tiP. According to the tradition, cit + ŚaP too is an aṅga with respect to tiP. 
 
1 Affix LAṬ occurs after a verbal root when the action is denoted at the current time (vartamāna). 
2 Tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mib-vas-mas-ta-ātāṁ-jha-thās-āthāṁ-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-mahiṅ. 
3 Though the tradition does not explicitly state this, it becomes clear from the derivations we will 
examine below that such is indeed the case.  
4 Affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 

110 
 
Thereafter, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca5 to cit and get cet + ŚaP + tiP i.e., ceta 
+ tiP. According to the tradition, ceta too can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP.  
So, cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta can all be called aṅga with respect to tiP, in the tradition’s opinion. 
I disagree with the traditional perspective: in my opinion, we can have only one aṅga per affix 
per derivation6. So, which one of the three options, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta, should be 
called an aṅga with respect to tiP? I think ceta alone can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. 
I will present my arguments to support this claim below. But before we proceed, I must admit 
that I am unable to provide any strong evidence from Pāṇini’s rules to justify the arguments I 
make below. Nonetheless, I will discuss some derivations in section 4.2 of this chapter which 
will prove that if we accept any other item but ceta as the aṅga with respect to tiP, we risk 
getting the wrong form at the end of the derivation. That said, now let us consider all three 
possibilities, namely cit, cit + ŚaP and ceta.  
Let us first look at cit. If Pāṇini wanted us to treat cit as an aṅga with respect to tiP, he could 
have simply said yasmāt pratyayavidhis tad pratyaye’ṅgam ‘a form after which an affix is 
introduced is termed aṅga when the affix follows.’ Thus, I do not think that we should call cit 
an aṅga with respect to tiP. This leaves us with two options: cit + ŚaP and ceta. Let us closely 
consider 1.4.13 in the context of this derivation to decide which of the two should be called an 
aṅga with respect to tiP.  
yasmāt – to (lit. after) cit 
pratyayavidhis – (upon the) addition of tiP 
tadādi – that which begins with cit 
pratyaye – when tiP follows 
aṅgam – (is called) aṅga. 
 
5 Guṇa replaces the iK of a verbal base which ends in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ 
vowel as its penultimate sound when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
6 I must clarify that, in my view, the modified version of an aṅga too can be called an aṅga, thanks to 
1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau, which teaches that the substitute is treated like the substituendum, 
except when an operation relative to the original sound is to be performed. So, for example, in deva + 
bhyām, deva is an aṅga with respect to bhyām. By applying 7.3.102 supi ca, we get devā + bhyām. devā 
too can be called an aṅga with respect to bhyām by 1.1.56 sthānivad ādeśo’nalvidhau. 

111 
 
‘Upon the addition of tiP to cit, that which begins with cit is called aṅga when tiP follows.’ 
The form which begins with cit is an aṅga with respect to tiP. Can we say that cit + ŚaP begins 
with cit? I do not think so. I think cit + ŚaP is still just a string of two separate items, namely 
the root cit and the vikaraṇa affix ŚaP. Only when they are fused into a single form that begins 
with cit, that form can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. When can we fuse cit and ŚaP into 
a single form?  I think we can do that after applying all possible rules to cit and ŚaP, except 
those that are triggered by tiP.  
So here, we apply 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca to cit (an operation triggered by ŚaP, not 
by tiP) and get cet + ŚaP + tiP. Note that cet and ŚaP cannot undergo any other operations 
which are not triggered by tiP, so we can fuse cet + ŚaP into a single form, i.e., ceta. Ceta 
begins with cet and is followed by tiP, so it can be called an aṅga with respect to tiP. I 
summarize this information in this table: 
Step 
Question 
Traditional opinion 
My opinion 
cit + tiP 
Is cit an aṅga w.r.t.7 tiP? 
Yes 
No 
cit + ŚaP + tiP Is cit + ŚaP an aṅga w.r.t. tiP? 
Yes 
No 
ceta + tiP 
Is ceta an aṅga w.r.t. tiP? 
Yes 
Yes 
 
In my opinion, through 6.4.1 aṅgasya, Pāṇini teaches that, for any P + Q, a rule RP taught in 
the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered by Q is applicable to its intended operand P only if P is an 
aṅga with respect to affix Q. Similarly, a rule RQ taught in the aṅgādhikāra which is triggered 
by P is applicable to its intended operand Q only if P is an aṅga with respect to affix Q.  
Also, note that I agree with the tradition that cit is an aṅga with respect to ŚaP. So, at the step 
cit + ŚaP + tiP, 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, which belongs to the aṅgādhikāra and 
which is triggered by ŚaP, is applicable to cit.  
Before we go further, note that, we find vikaraṇas only in tiṅanta and kr̥ danta derivations. So, 
in the rest of the derivations, it is very easy to determine what we should call an aṅga with 
respect to the affix. For instance, in deva + bhis (example 1 of section 2.7, chapter 2), deva is 
an aṅga with respect to bhis simply because the affix bhis has been added to deva. Similarly, 
in sad + vas + Ṅas (example 2 of section 3.2, chapter 3), sad + vas is an aṅga with respect to 
 
7 w.r.t. = with respect to. 

112 
 
Ṅas simply because the affix Ṅas has been added to sad + vas. In derivations involving 
vikaraṇas, because we add affix C to base A and then add another affix B between base A and 
affix C, the process of identifying the aṅga with respect to affix C becomes somewhat 
complicated, as observed above.  
 
4.2 Examples of Application of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 
Now I will discuss some examples through which I will show that my interpretation of 1.4.13 
and 6.4.1 alone can help us derive the correct final form. But first, let me offer a clarification.  
In many of the examples discussed in this chapter, the derivation should begin with: verbal 
base + lakāra. At this stage, there are two possibilities:  
(i) only one rule, i.e., the rule which teaches the replacement of the lakāra is applicable, and 
this rule applies. 
(ii) multiple rules, including the rule which teaches the replacement of the lakāra are 
applicable.  
verbal base       +       lakāra 
 
                                                               M           N           O 
The rule O, which teaches the replacement of the lakāra is the right-most. Thus, by my 
interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply rule O. 
Note that, in both cases (i) and (ii), the rule that replaces the lakāra applies at the first step. So, 
in order to simplify the presentation, in all the examples where the derivation should start with 
verbal base + lakāra, I simply start it with verbal base + tiṄ (one of the eighteen finite 
replacements of the lakāras) instead. For instance, in the first derivation discussed in this 
section, technically the derivation should proceed as follows: edh + LAṬ (3.2.123 vartamāne 
laṭ)  edh + jha (3.4.77 lasya, 3.4.78 tiptasjhi…). However, I start with edh + jha, purely for 
the purpose of avoiding redundancy.  
 

113 
 
(1) edh + jha – ‘to grow’, present third-person plural8 
As stated in section 4.1 of this chapter, we cannot call edh an aṅga with respect to jha. 
Consequently, at this step, rules taught in the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 – 7.4), such as 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ 
(which teaches that a jh which is the initial sound an affix is replaced with ant) or 7.1.5 
ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ (which teaches that a jh, which is the initial sound of an ātmanepada 
affix preceded by a verbal base that does not end in a, is replaced with at) cannot apply to jh.  
Here, only two rules are applicable:  
edh            +            jh   a 
 
                                                                     3.1.68            3.4.79  
3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 
3.4.79 ṭita ātmanepadānāṁ ṭer e: the part that begins with the last vowel (ṭi)9 of an ātmanepada 
replacement of a lakāra marked with Ṭ is replaced with e. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.79 and get: edh + jhe. At this stage 
too, we cannot call edh an aṅga with respect to jhe. Thus, 7.1.3 and 7.1.5 are not applicable 
here. Only one rule, namely 3.1.68 is applicable. Upon applying it, we get edh + ŚaP + jhe. At 
this step, edh and ŚaP cannot undergo any further operations which are not triggered by jhe, so 
we can simply write edh + ŚaP as edha. edha is an aṅga with respect to jhe. At this stage, of 
the two aforementioned rules which belong to the aṅgādhikāra, 7.1.3 is applicable but 7.1.5 is 
not. We apply 7.1.3, and get edha + ante. By 6.1.97 ato guṇe10, we get the correct form: 
edhante.  
To the best of my knowledge, the tradition does not discuss this example. However, let us 
consider what would have happened if we had not accepted my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 
6.4.1 respectively. At the step edh + jha, four rules would become applicable:  
 
 
8 Unless I explicitly state that the form being derived is passive, it must be assumed that it is active. 
9 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi.   
10 When a short a, that is not pada-final (word-final) is followed by a guṇa vowel i.e., a, e, or o, then 
both a and the following guṇa are replaced with the latter. 

114 
 
edh                       +                                  jh                           a    
        
                                                  3.1.68                 7.1.3                  7.1.5          3.4.79   
Note that all the DOI relationships here are of Type 2b (DOI non-conflict). As stated before, 
the tradition is not interested in non-conflict and mostly applies rules in a haphazard order in 
such cases.  
There is an SOI between 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ and 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ. 7.1.5 is more specific 
than and thus wins against 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ. If the tradition applies 7.1.5, which replaces jh with 
at first and applies 3.1.68 kartari śap at a later step, that gives *edhate, which is not the correct 
form.  
My interpretations of 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam and 6.4.1 aṅgasya 
respectively ensure that jh replacement, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place only 
after the application of 3.1.68 kartari śap, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. After the 
application of 3.1.68, 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ, which is an exception of 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, is 
no longer applicable to jh, and thus 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ applies to jh. This gives the correct form, 
edhante. 
 
(2) dhā + jhi – ‘to place’, present third-person plural  
As stated before, dhā cannot be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Consequently, rules taught 
in the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 – 7.4) cannot apply to dhā or jhi. For example, 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ cannot 
apply here. The derivation proceeds as follows: dhā + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap)  dhā + 
ŚLU + jhi (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ11)  dhādhā + ŚLU + jhi (6.1.10 ślau12)  dhadhā + 
ŚLU + jhi (7.4.59 hrasvaḥ13). At this point, we notice that dhadhā and ŚLU cannot undergo 
any other operations which are not triggered by jhi. So, we can write dhadhā + ŚLU as dhadhā. 
 
11 When the affix ŚaP is preceded by any verbal root belonging to the list headed by hu ‘to perform 
sacrifice’, it is replaced with ŚLU (cf. 1.1.61 pratyayasya lukślulupaḥ). 
12 A verbal base which has not already undergone reduplication undergoes reduplication when it is 
followed by ŚLU. (Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable 
does. See 6.1.1 ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. Unless necessary, I will not repeat 
this clarification in this chapter). 
13 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart.  

115 
 
In dhadhā + jhi, dhadhā can be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Therefore, the following 
rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable here: 
                                 dh       a      dh      ā                    +                 jh       i 
 
                                                          6.4.112                  7.1.3                  7.1.4 
6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ: the ā of the affix Śnā or the ā at the end of a reduplicated verbal 
base is replaced with LOPA when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which is the initial sound an affix is replaced with ant. 
7.1.4 ad abhyastāt: when preceded by a reduplicated base, a jh which is the initial sound an 
affix is replaced with at. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the RHS operation. But there is an SOI between 
7.1.3 and 7.1.4, both of which apply to the RHS operand. Because 7.1.4 has been taught for jh 
when it is preceded by a reduplicated base, it is more specific and wins. Thus, we get: dhadhā 
+ ati. Here 6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ applies and we get dhadh + ati. Now that all the 
possible rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, a rule from the tripādī section 
applies14:                                                              
8.4.54 abhyāse car ca: in an abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables), jhaL (a non-nasal 
stop or a fricative) is replaced with caR (c, ṭ, t, k, p, ś, ṣ, s) or jaŚ (j, b, g, ḍ, d). 
Thus, we get dhadhati  dadhati, which is the correct answer. 
Let us now look at how the tradition tackles this problem. Like in the previous example, in this 
example too, there are no cases of DOI conflict, and so the tradition chooses to apply rules in 
a random order. But some sequences of rule application can give the wrong answer. For 
example: dhā + jhi  dhā + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68)  dhā + ŚaP + anti (7.1.3)  dhā + ŚLU + 
anti (2.4.75)  *dadhanti (6.1.10 ślau etc.). In sum, if jh undergoes replacement before the 
reduplication of dhā, we get the wrong answer. To address this issue, the tradition has come up 
 
14 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham teaches that from this rule onwards, a following rule is asiddha ‘suspended’ 
with respect to a preceding rule. So, if 8.4.54 and any rule that precedes it in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial 
order are simultaneously applicable, then the latter will not acknowledge 8.4.54 and will thus apply at 
that step. 8.4.54 can apply only after this. I will demonstrate this more elaborately in the following 
chapter which is devoted to the concepts asiddha and asiddhavat. 

116 
 
with the following ideas. Consider paribhāṣās 62 and 63 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara and their 
translation by Kielhorn: 
 pūrvaṁ hy apavādā abhiniviśante paścād utsargāḥ (62). 
‘apavādas, it is certain, are considered first (in order to find out where they apply); afterwards 
the general rules (are made to take effect in all cases to which it has thus been ascertained that 
the apavādas do not apply)’.   
prakalpya vāpavādaviṣayaṁ tata utsargo’bhiniviśate (63).15  
‘Or (we may say that) first all (forms) which fall under the apavāda are set aside, and that 
subsequently the general rule is employed (in the formation of the remaining forms).” 
Let us see what happens if we follow these paribhāṣās at the first step (dhā + jhi). At this step, 
7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, which is the apavāda of 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, is not applicable. Since the apavāda 
is not applicable, we go ahead and apply the utsarga 7.1.3. But this gives us the wrong form 
*dadhanti. Taking cognizance of this problem, the tradition has come up with the following 
metarule: 
upasaṁjaniṣyamāṇanimitto’py apavāda upasaṁjātanimittam apy utsargaṁ bādhata iti (64). 
‘An apavāda supersedes, even though the causes of its (application) are still to present 
themselves, a general rule the causes (of the application) of which are already present.’ 
In other words, this paribhāṣā teaches that even though 7.1.3 is applicable to jh from the 
beginning of the derivation, one must not replace jh until the apavāda 7.1.4 becomes 
applicable. This gives the correct answer, dadhati.  
As stated in the first chapter, the tradition often comes up with a new paribhāṣā to address 
individual problems like this one. Paribhāṣā 64 is a good case in point.  
My method ensures that the replacement of jha, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place 
after the reduplication of dhā, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. Therefore, 7.1.3 
jho’ntaḥ does not become applicable until 7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, its exception, also becomes 
applicable. 7.1.4 wins, thereby giving the correct form dadhati. My method is able to tackle 
 
15 Paribhāṣās 62 and 63 are found mentioned together on numerous occasions in the Mahābhāṣya (See 
Bronkhorst 2004: 18, footnote 11 for details). 

117 
 
this issue without relying on paribhāṣās like Pbh 64, which require us to look ahead into the 
derivation. 
Before we move on to discussing other examples, note that Pāṇini teaches most substitutions 
and other operations pertaining to the eighteen finite affixes from 3.4.77 to 3.4.112. For 
example, 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca16, 3.4.101 tasthasthamipāṁ tāṁtaṁtāmaḥ17 etc. He teaches the 
substitution of jhi from 3.4.108 jher jus to 3.4.112 dviṣaś ca.  However, the three rules teaching 
the replacement of jh, i.e., 7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ, 7.1.4 ad abhyastāt, and 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ 
are found in the aṅgādhikāra, and not in the section 3.4.77-3.4.112. This strongly suggests that 
Pāṇini wants us to treat 7.1.3-7.1.5 differently, that is, he wants us to apply them only when jh 
is part of an affix which is preceded by what I define as an aṅga.  
 
(3) hā + tas – ‘to abandon’, present third-person dual 
hā is not an aṅga with respect to tas. So here, we cannot apply rules from the aṅgādhikāra, 
such as 6.4.116 jahāteś ca (see translation below). The derivation proceeds as follows: hā + 
tas  hā + ŚaP + tas (3.1.68 kartari śap)  hā + ŚLU + tas (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ)  
hāhā + ŚLU + tas (6.1.10 ślau). Here, two rules are applicable, which are from the 
aṅgādhikāra, but which are not triggered by tas:  
                                 h              ā            hā           +        ŚLU       +          tas 
 
                             7.4.62     7.4.59       
7.4.62 kuhoś cuḥ: a consonant of the k-series (kU), or a h, that is part of the abhyāsa (first of 
two reduplicated syllables) is replaced with a consonant of the c-series (cU). 
7.4.59 hrasvaḥ: the vowel of the abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables) is replaced with 
its short counterpart. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.4.59 and get hahā + ŚLU + tas. To 
this, we apply 7.4.62 and get jhahā + ŚLU + tas. Now, jhahā and ŚLU cannot undergo any 
further operations which are not triggered by tas, so we can write jhahā + ŚLU as jhahā. Now, 
 
16 A siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not marked with P. 
17 The tas, thas, tha and miP replacements for any lakāra marked with Ṅ, are replaced with tām, tam, 
ta and am, respectively. 

118 
 
jhahā is an aṅga with respect to tas. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra, which 
are triggered by tas, become applicable: 
                                                          jhah           ā                    +                 tas 
 
                                                             6.4.113          6.4.116 
6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā, or of a reduplicated stem 
(abhyasta) excluding those termed ghu, is replaced with ī when a sārvadhātuka affix beginning 
with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows.   
6.4.116 jahāteś ca: the final ā of hā 'to abandon’, is optionally replaced with i, when a 
sārvadhātuka affix beginning with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.113 and 6.4.116. Since 6.4.116 has been taught 
specifically for hā, it wins, as a result of which we get jhahitas. Finally, since all rules from the 
sapādasaptādhyāyī have been applied, we apply 8.4.54 abhyāse car ca from the tripādī and 
get jhahitaḥ  jahitaḥ, which is the correct answer.  
Note that 6.4.116 jahāteś ca is an optional rule. If we do not implement18 it, 6.4.113 ī haly 
aghoḥ applies, giving us jahītaḥ, which is also correct.    
To the best of my knowledge, the tradition has not discussed this problem. But, since this 
derivation does not involve any DOI conflicts, the tradition would have applied rules in any 
haphazard order. Let us look at one of the possible paths this derivation would have taken if 
we had not accepted my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively: hā + tas  hā + ŚaP 
+ tas (3.1.68 kartari śap)  hā + ŚLU + tas (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ śluḥ)   hi + ŚLU + tas 
(6.4.116 jahāteś ca)  *jihitaḥ (6.1.10 ślau etc).  
The possibility of getting such a wrong answer is completely eliminated by following my 
interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively. This is because, my method ensures that 
6.4.116, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra and replaces ā of hā with i, applies only after the 
reduplication of root hā by 6.1.10 ślau, which is taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. 
 
 
 
18 Note that I will use the word ‘implement’ henceforth in relation with optionality. 

119 
 
(4) vap + ta – ‘to sow’, imperfect passive third-person singular  
Note that vap is not an aṅga with respect to ta, so rules like 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ (see 
translation below) which are part of the aṅgādhikāra, cannot apply at this step. The following 
rules are applicable to vap + ta: 
v         ap            +           ta 
 
                                                 6.1.15                 3.1.67 
6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām ca: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj 
‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows.19 
3.1.67 sārvadhātuke yak: affix yaK occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes bhāva or karman follows. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 3.1.67 applies, and we get: vap + yaK + ta. 
Thereafter the derivation proceeds as follows: vap + yaK + ta  uap + yaK + ta (6.1.15)  
up + yaK + ta (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca20). Since up and yaK cannot undergo any other 
operations which are not triggered by ta, we can write up + yaK as upya. In upya + ta, upya is 
an aṅga with respect to ta. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra which are triggered 
by ta become applicable: 
upya         +         ta 
 
                                            6.4.71             6.4.72 
6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: the udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment aṬ is attached to a verbal 
base when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥ Ṅ follow. 
6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām: the udāttaḥ ‘high-pitched’ augment āṬ is attached to a verbal base which 
begins with a vowel (aC) when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥ Ṅ follow. 
 
19 Note that this rule is applicable because ta, by virtue of being an apit sārvadhātuka, can be treated as 
marked with K, by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit.  
20 A samprasāraṇa vowel and the following vowel, are together replaced with the former. 

120 
 
This is a case of SOI. 6.4.72 has been taught specifically for bases which begin with a vowel 
and thus wins, thereby giving us the correct form ā-upya + ta  aupyata (6.1.90 āṭaś ca21).  
Let us now consider how the tradition deals with this example. Like in the previous examples, 
here too, we do not find any instances of DOI conflict. Therefore, the tradition applies rules in 
a random order. If the attachment of the augment had been undertaken before samprasāraṇa, 
we would have got the incorrect form: a-vapyata (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ)  a-uapyata 
(6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām ca)  *opyata (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca, 6.1.78 
eco’yavāyāvaḥ). In order to overcome this problem, the Kāśikā, on 6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām, 
suggests that there is a conflict between augment addition and processes such as replacement 
of LAṄ and introduction of the vikaraṇa yaK, and by nityatva and antaraṅgatva respectively 
these two processes defeat the addition of the augment aṬ.22 
We may conclude that the tradition comes up with a tailored solution to this problem. In 
contrast with this, my method eliminates the need to rely on post-Pāṇinian tools and 
paribhāṣās. My respective interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 ensure that the addition of the 
augment, which is taught in the aṅgādhikāra, takes place only after samprasāraṇa, which is 
taught outside the aṅgādhikāra. As a result of this, 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ does not 
become applicable until 6.4.72 āḍ ajādīnām, which is its exception, also becomes applicable. 
6.4.72 wins, thereby giving the correct form aupyata. 
In sum, these four examples prove that my interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively are 
correct. In all four derivations, the tradition applies rules in a haphazard order, as a result of 
which it often gets the wrong form at the end of the derivation. It is forced to come up with 
individual solutions for each of these problems.  
It is also noteworthy that in cases of the type ‘base + affix (1) + affix (2)’, Pāṇini teaches those 
processes which contribute towards the construction of the aṅga with respect to affix (2) before 
 
21 A single vr̥ ddhi vowel replaces both āṬ and the vowel following it. 
22 Iha aijyata, aupyata, auhyata iti laṅi kr̥ te lāvasthāyām aḍāgamād antaraṅgatvāl lādeśaḥ kriyate, 
tatra kr̥ te vikaraṇo nityatvād aḍāgamaṁ bādhate ‘Here [with reference to the derivation of the forms] 
aijyata, aupyata, auhyata, after the addition of the affix LAṄ, in that state of the lakāra, by 
antaraṅgatva, the substitution of the lakāra is done [rather than] the addition of the augment aṬ, and 
thereafter, by nityatva, the [addition of] vikaraṇa defeats [the insertion of] augment aṬ.’ 
 
 

121 
 
6.4.1, in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order. For example, he teaches the addition of vikaraṇas in 
pāda 3.1 and vowel sandhi, reduplication and samprasāraṇa in pāda 6.1. 
 
4.3 Examples of DOI Conflict 
Now I will discuss examples of DOI conflict, which are of interest to the tradition, and show 
how my interpretation of 1.4.2 is able to solve these cases. I will also consistently apply my 
interpretations of 1.4.13 and 6.4.1 respectively in all these examples.  
In each example, I will prove the existence of DOI conflict and apply my interpretation of 1.4.2 
to solve it. As stated in chapter 2, generally speaking, to deal with examples of DOI conflict, 
the tradition uses nityatva (for cases of unidirectional blocking), niravakāśatva or its 
interpretation of 1.4.2, as per convenience. To avoid repetition, I will not mention the 
traditional solution for each example below. 
Note that almost all cases of DOI conflict in derivations of finite verbs and primary derivatives 
involve unidirectional, and not mutual blocking. We will investigate this further later in this 
chapter. 
Lastly, also note that kr̥ danta forms are prātipadikas by 1.2.46 kr̥ ttaddhitasamāsāś ca and thus 
they can take suP affixes by 4.1.1 ṅyāpprātipadikāt. However, in the examples I have discussed 
in this section, I have not added suP affixes to kr̥ danta forms. This is purely to avoid repetition 
and redundancy. This does not affect the derivations discussed in this chapter.23 For example, 
the first derivation śvi + Ktvā should actually begin in the following manner: śvi + Ktvā  śvi 
+ Ktvā + sU (4.1.2 su-au-jas…) śvi + Ktvā (1.1.40 ktvātosunkasunaḥ, 2.4.82 avyayād 
āpsupaḥ). Here onwards, the derivation proceeds as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
23 I have included the kr̥ danta derivation sad + KvasU + Ṅas in the previous chapter because there, 
nominal inflection plays a crucial role in helping us obtain the correct form.  

122 
 
1. śvi + Ktvā – ‘to swell’, absolutive 
śvi    +    Ktvā 
 
                                                             6.1.15       7.2.35 
6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām kiti: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj 
‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows. 
7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning 
with vaL (any consonant except y). 
If iṬ is attached to Ktvā by 7.2.35, then according to 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ (which teaches that a 
Ktvā which has taken the augment iṬ is not treated as marked with K), itvā will no longer be 
treated as marked with K. And so, 6.1.15, which applies to certain roots which are followed by 
a K-marked affix, will not be applicable at the following step. So, 7.2.35 blocks 6.1.15. On the 
other hand, 7.2.35 will still be applicable after the application of 6.1.15. So, 6.1.15 does not 
block 7.2.35. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.2.35 wins and we get: śvi + itvā. Since itvā can 
no longer be treated as marked with K, 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ24 causes guṇa of 
i, thereby giving us śve + itvā. By 6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ, we get the correct form: śvayitvā.  
 
2. han + Kta – ‘to kill’, past passive participle 
h   a   n  +  Kta 
 
                                                            6.4.15   6.4.37 
6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: the penultimate vowel of a base which ends in a nasal 
(anunāsika), is replaced with its long counterpart when affix KvI, or an affix beginning with 
jhaL ‘a non-nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base 
marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots 
 
24 Guṇa replaces the final sound iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka 
affix follows. 

123 
 
headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL ‘a non-
nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
If n of han is replaced with LOPA by 6.4.37, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step. 
But if the vowel of han is lengthened by 6.4.15, 6.4.37 will still be applicable at the following 
step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.37 and get the correct form hata. 
 
3. han + jhi – ‘to kill’, present third-person plural 
As per my interpretation of 1.4.13, han cannot be called an aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, rules 
from the aṅgādhikāra are not applicable at this step. I will not repeat this clarification 
henceforth and will assume that the reader is by now familiar with it. 
han + jhi  han + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap25)  han + LUK + jhi (2.4.72 
adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ26). Now han and LUK cannot undergo any other operations which are 
not triggered by jhi, so han + LUK can be written as han, which is an aṅga with respect to jhi. 
Here, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra (6.4 to 7.4) are applicable: 
h        a       n    +     jhi 
 
                                                           6.4.15     6.4.37      7.1.3 
6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: same as above. 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: same as above. 
7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which constitutes the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 
We already know from the previous example that there is a Type 2a (DOI conflict) between 
6.4.15 and 6.4.37, and that 6.4.37 wins. So now let us consider the relationship between 6.4.37 
and 7.1.3.  
 
25 Affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
26 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after one of the roots headed by adA ‘to eat’ in the 
Dhātupāṭha. 

124 
 
If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
7.1.3 at this step, the affix will no longer begin with a jhaL sound, and therefore 6.4.37 will not 
be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI 
conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 7.1.3 wins, and we get han + anti  hn 
+ anti (6.4.98 gamahanajanakhanaghasāṁ lopaḥ kṅity anaṅi27)  ghnanti (7.3.54 ho hanter 
ñṇinneṣu28), which is the correct form. 
 
4. kramU + Ktvā – ‘to stride’, absolutive 
kramU   +   Ktvā 
 
                                                            6.4.18          7.2.56 
6.4.18 kramaś ca ktvi: the penultimate vowel of kramU ‘stride’, is optionally replaced with its 
long counterpart when affix Ktvā, beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative), follows. 
7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is, optionally, attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root 
marked with U. 
 If, by 7.2.56, the iṬ augment is attached to Ktvā, then 6.4.18, which requires the affix to begin 
a specific kind of consonant, will not be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 6.4.18, 
7.2.56 will still be applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get the correct form: kramitvā.  
Note that both 6.4.18 and 7.2.56 are optional rules. So, for each of these rules we have a choice. 
We can either implement the rule or not do so. Let us consider what happens in different 
scenarios: 
 
 
27 The penultimate sound of gam ‘to go’, han ‘to kill’, jan ‘to be born’, khan ‘to dig’ and ghas ‘to eat’, 
is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with a vowel and marked with K or Ṅ, except aṄ, 
follows. 
28 The h of han ‘to harm, kill’ is replaced with a velar stop when an affix marked with Ñ and Ṇ, or 
simply n (i.e., after LOPA of a) follows. 

125 
 
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get: 
(i) krantvā, if we do not implement the optional rule 6.4.18; and 
(ii) krāntvā, if we do implement the optional rule 6.4.18. 
If we implement 7.2.56 but not 6.4.18, we get, again, krāntvā. 
All three forms, krantvā, krāntvā and kramitvā are correct. 
 
5. atikram + Ktvā – ‘to surpass’, absolutive 
                                                             atikram  +  Ktvā  
 
     6.4.18     7.1.3729 
6.4.18 kramaś ca ktvi: same as above. 
7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: in a compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the 
affix Ktvā in the second member of the compound is replaced with LyaP. 
If we apply 7.1.37, LyaP replaces Ktvā and so 6.4.18 will not be applicable at the following 
step. But if we apply 6.4.18, 7.1.37 will still be applicable at the following step. This is a case 
of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get the correct form: 
atikramya. 
It is important to point out an anomaly here. Pāṇini’s rule 2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ teaches that 
the particle ku, items termed gati (including ati) and items belonging to the group headed by 
pra (which also includes ati) combine with syntactically related padas to form tatpuruṣa 
compounds. We know, thanks to 2.1.4 saha supā, that a compound is composed of forms 
ending in suP. Since the three forms krantvā / krāntvā / kramitvā (see example 4 of this section) 
 
29 Note that, here, an SOI takes place between 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap and 7.2.56 udito vā. 
7.1.37 wins because it has been specifically taught for compounds. Here, since the focus is on DOI 
conflict, I have avoided mentioning this and other such SOI relationships where it was possible to avoid 
them.  

126 
 
end in suP (which is replaced with LUK by 2.4.82 avyayād āpsupaḥ), ati can combine with any 
of these forms to construct a tatpuruṣa compound. Let us consider each of the three scenarios: 
a. Compound between ati and krantvā.  
By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikranya, which 
is not the correct form. 
b. Compound between ati and krāntvā.  
By 7.1.37, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get *atikrānya, which is also not the correct form. 
c. Compound between ati and kramitvā.  
By 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap, we replace Ktvā with LyaP and get atikramiya  
*atikramitya (6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ ti tuk), which is not the correct form. 
To derive the correct form, we have to start the derivation by adding the verbal root kram to 
ati which constitutes the pūrvapada. To that, we add affix Ktvā: atikram + Ktvā. This alone 
gives us the correct answer.30 We see the same phenomenon in examples 6-8 below. But this 
runs contrary to how we generally construct compounds – by combining two or more subanta 
forms.  
Thus, the following question arises: if it is difficult to derive atikramya correctly as a 
compound, why does Pāṇini want us to view atikramya as a compound in the first place? This 
likely has to do with accentuation, which is not the focus of this thesis. The distinction between 
atikramya and atikrāmati (where ati is only a morpho-syntactically bound particle cf. 1.4.8 te 
prāg dhātoḥ), the status of particles like ati in Vedic and the relationship between Ktvā and 
LyaP in Vedic can all shed more light on this matter, but we cannot delve into these topics 
here. 
 
 
 
30 The tradition too takes cognizance of this. Vyāḍi suggests that an operation involving the upasarga 
and the verbal base is antaraṅga: dhātūpasargayor antaraṅgaṁ kāryam bhavati (Pbh 37 of 
Paribhāṣāsūcanam). We know that an antaraṅga operation gets precedence over a bahiraṅga 
operation. 

127 
 
6. prasthā + Ktvā – ‘to depart’, absolutive 
prasthā    +    Ktvā 
 
                                                                7.4.40        7.1.37    
7.4.40 dyatisyatimāsthām it ti kiti: a short i replaces the final sound of do ‘to cut’, ṣo ‘to end, 
terminate’, mā ‘to measure’ and sthā ‘to stay’, when a t-initial affix marked with K follows. 
7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 
If we replace Ktvā with LyaP by 7.1.37, the affix no longer begins with t and thus 7.4.40 will 
not be applicable at the following step. On the other hand, if we apply 7.4.40, 7.1.37 will still 
be applicable at the following step.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 which gives the correct form: 
prasthāya. 
 
7. āgam + Ktvā – ‘to come’, absolutive 
āgam          +          Ktvā 
 
                                                           6.4.37                 7.1.37  
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base 
marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots 
headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-
nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 
If we replace Ktvā with LyaP by 7.1.37, the affix no longer begins with jhaL and thus 6.4.37 
will not be applicable at the following step. On the other hand, if we apply 6.4.37, 7.1.37 will 
still be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of 
DOI conflict.  

128 
 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: āgam + tvā  āgam + 
ya (7.1.37)  āga + ya (6.4.38 vā lyapi31)   āgatya (6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ ti tuk32), which 
is the correct form. Note that the application of 6.4.38 is optional. If we do not implement this 
rule, we get āgamya, which is also correct. 
 
8. praveÑ  +  Ktvā – ‘to weave’, absolutive 
praveÑ     +     Ktvā 
 
                                                              6.1.15          7.1.37 
6.1.15 vacisvapiyajādīnām kiti: roots vac ‘to speak’, svap ‘to sleep’, and those headed by yaj 
‘to perform sacrifice’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K follows. 
7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: same as above. 
If we apply 6.1.15 at this step, 7.1.37 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we 
apply 7.1.37 at this step, then by 6.1.41 lyapi ca (which teaches that veÑ does not undergo 
samprasāraṇa when LyaP follows), 6.1.15, which teaches samprasāraṇa, will not be 
applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI 
conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: prave + ya  pravāya 
(6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti33), which is the correct form. 
 
 
 
 
31 The final nasal of a root marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha (cf. upadeśe), as well 
as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is optionally replaced with LOPA before 
the substitute LyaP. 
32 Augment tUK is attached to a root ending in a short vowel when a kr̥ t affix marked with P follows. 
33 The final sound of a verbal base ending in eC (e, o, ai, au) when taught in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced 
with ā, when an affix that is not marked with Ś follows. 

129 
 
9. śās + siP – ‘to instruct’, imperative second-person singular  
śās            +            siP 
 
                                                                       3.1.68      3.4.87 
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not 
marked with P. 
These two rules do not block each other. This is not a case of conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get śās + hi  śās + ŚaP + 
hi (3.1.68)  śās + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ34). śās can now be called an aṅga with 
respect to hi (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra 
become applicable: 
śās                +               hi 
 
                                        6.4.34            6.4.35                  7.1.35 
6.4.34 śāsa id aṅhaloḥ: the penultimate sound of śās, is replaced with short i when followed 
by aṄ, or an affix that begins with a consonant and is marked with K or Ṅ.35  
6.4.35 śā hau: śās is replaced with śā when affix hi follows. 
7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: affixes tu and hi are optionally replaced with tātAṄ, 
provided benediction (āśiḥ) is denoted.36 
 
34 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after one of the roots headed by adA ‘to eat’ in the 
Dhātupāṭha. 
35 hi is an apit (cf. 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca) sārvadhātuka, and so by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit, it can be 
treated as marked with K or Ṅ. Thus, 6.4.34 is applicable here.  
36 For a discussion on how this rule should be interpreted using Pāṇini’s metarules, see Appendix A.  

130 
 
Here, we see that there is an SOI interaction between 6.4.34 and 6.4.3537 and a DOI interaction 
between them and 7.1.35. Let’s first deal with the SOI between 6.4.34 and 6.4.35. 6.4.35 is 
more specific because it pertains to the hi affix alone and thus wins38. So now let us discuss the 
relationship between 6.4.35 and 7.1.35. 
If we apply 6.4.35, 7.1.35 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 7.1.35, 
hi will be replaced with tātAṄ and thus 6.4.35 will not be applicable at the following step. This 
is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.35 and get: śās + tāt  śis + tāt 
(6.4.34 śāsa idaṅhaloḥ)  śiṣṭāt (8.3.60 śāsivasighasīnāṁ ca, 8.4.41 ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ), which is the 
correct form. 
 
10. han + siP – ‘to hurt’, imperative second-person singular 
han      +       siP 
 
                                                                   3.1.68    3.4.87  
3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: same as above.   
Neither of the two rules blocks the other. This is a case of DOI non-conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get han + hi  han + ŚaP + 
hi (3.1.68)  han + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). han can now be called an aṅga with 
respect to hi (cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra 
become applicable: 
 
 
 
37 The operand of 6.4.34 is a part of the operand of 6.4.35 and so, like in the previous chapters, here 
too, we classify such interactions as Type 1 (SOI).  
38 Note that 6.4.35 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.34, but in my view, this does not affect the way in 
which we deal with SOI. I will discuss this further in the next chapter.  

131 
 
han      +      hi 
 
                                                  6.4.36         6.4.37      7.1.35 
6.4.36 hanter jaḥ: the root han is replaced with ja when the affix hi follows. 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base 
marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots 
headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-
nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows.39 
7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: same as above. 
There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.36 and 6.4.37.  6.4.36 is specifically taught for han + 
hi and so it is clearly more specific than 6.4.37. So, we put 6.4.37 aside. Now let us consider 
the relationship between 6.4.36 and 7.1.35. 
If we apply 6.4.36 at this step, 7.1.35 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if 
we replace hi with tātAṄ by 7.1.35 at this step, then 6.4.36, which applies only when han is 
followed by hi, will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional 
blocking and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.35 and get han + tātAṄ  hatāt 
(6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti), which is the correct 
form. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
39 Since hi is an apit sārvadhātuka, it can be treated as marked with K by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit. 
Thus 6.4.37 is applicable.  

132 
 
11. radh + ṆiC40 – ‘to subdue’, causative present third-person singular 
radh is an aṅga with respect to ṆiC. ṆiC can trigger two operations from the aṅgādhikāra on 
radh namely 7.2.116 and 7.1.67.  
                                                        r       a          dh   +    ṆiC           
 
                                                      7.2.116     7.1.61                        3.2.123  
7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: a vowel termed vr̥ ddhi replaces the penultimate sound a of a verbal 
base when an affix marked with Ṇ or Ñ follows. 
7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: augment nUM is attached to radhA ‘to subdue’ and jabhA ‘to gape’ 
when an affix beginning with a vowel follows. 
3.2.123 vartamāne laṭ: affix LAṬ occurs after a verbal root when the action is denoted at the 
current time (vartamāna). 
3.2.123 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules. Let us look at the relationship 
between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61.  
If we apply 7.2.116, 7.1.61 will still be applicable at the following step. However, if we apply 
7.1.61, that is, if we insert the augment nUM before the final dh (cf. 1.1.47 mid aco’ntyāt 
paraḥ), then a is no longer the penultimate sound, and so 7.2.116 will not be applicable at the 
following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 3.2.123 get radh + ṆiC + LAṬ. 
Here, the following rules are applicable: 
                  r       a          dh   +    ṆiC    +      LAṬ 
 
                                                      7.2.116    7.1.61                         3.4.78 
7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 
7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: same as above. 
3.4.78 tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mib-vas-mas-ta-ātāṁ-jha-thās-āthāṁ-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-mahiṅ 
 
40 3.1.26 hetumati ca. 

133 
 
We have already discussed the relationship between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61. 3.4.78 neither blocks 
nor is blocked by the other two rules. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.4.78 and get radh + ṆiC + tiP. 
At this step, multiple rules are applicable: 
                  r       a          dh   +    ṆiC    +      tiP 
 
         7.2.116     7.1.61               3.1.68 
 
7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 
7.1.61 radhijabhor aci: same as above. 
3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 
We have already discussed the relationship between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61. 3.1.68 neither blocks 
nor is blocked by the other two rules. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 3.1.68 and get: radh + ṆiC + ŚaP 
+ tiP. At this point, two rules are applicable: 
                  r       a          dh   +    ṆiC    +     ŚaP    +     tiP 
 
                                              7.2.116     7.1.61         
We have already established that there is a DOI conflict between 7.2.116 and 7.1.61.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.61 and get randh + ṆiC + ŚaP + tiP. 
randh and ṆiC cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by ŚaP, so we can 
write randh + ṆiC as randhi. randhi is an aṅga with respect to ŚaP. Thus by 7.3.84 
sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ41, which belongs to the aṅgādhikāra and is triggered here by 
ŚaP, is applicable to randhi. Upon its application, we get randhe + a + ti  randhaya + ti 
(6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ)  randhayati, which is the correct form.  
 
 
41 Guṇa replaces the final sound iK of a verbal base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 

134 
 
12. glai  +  tiP – ‘to become tired’, present third-person singular 
glai        +         tiP 
 
                                                           6.1.45      3.1.68  
6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti: the final sound of a verbal root which ends in eC when taught in 
the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with ā, when an affix which is not marked with Ś follows. 
3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 
If we apply 6.1.45 at this step, 3.1.68 will be applicable at the following step. But if we add the 
affix ŚaP at this step by 3.1.68, then 6.1.45 will not be applicable at the following step.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my application of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.68 and get the correct form: glai + a + 
ti  glāyati (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ). 
 
13. dr̥ ś + tumUN – ‘to see’, infinitive 
d           r̥           ś    +    tumUN 
 
                                                        7.3.86    6.1.58 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal base which ends in 
the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a 
sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
6.1.58 sr̥ jidr̥ śor jhaly am akiti: augment aM is attached to verbal roots sr̥ j ‘to release, project’ 
and dr̥ śIR ‘to look’ before an affix which begins with a jhaL, but is not marked with K. 
If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 6.1.58 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we 
apply 6.1.58 at this step, r̥  will no longer be the penultimate vowel and so 7.3.86 will not be 
applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. By my interpretation of 
1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.58 and get dr̥ aś + tum  draś + tum (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci)  
draṣ + tum (8.2.36 vraścabhrasjasr̥ jamr̥ jayajarājabhrājacchaśāṁ ṣaḥ)  draṣṭum (8.4.41 
ṣṭunā ṣṭuḥ), which is the correct form. 

135 
 
14. bhū + tiP – ‘to be’, aorist third-person singular  
bhū      +        ti 
 
            3.1.43    3.4.100 
 
3.1.43 cli luṅi: affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 
3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 
There is no conflict between the two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 
rule 3.4.100 and get: bhū + t. At this step, only one rule, namely 3.1.43 is applicable. On 
applying this rule, we get bhū + cli + tiP. Since bhū is an aṅga with respect to cli, 7.3.84 from 
the aṅgādhikāra is applicable here, and so is 3.1.44: 
bhū     +     cli      +      t 
 
                                                        7.3.84       3.1.44 
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final sound iK of a verbal base when 
a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
3.1.44 cleḥ sic: cli is replaced with sIC. 
There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 
rule 3.1.44 and get bhū + sIC + t. Here three rules are applicable: 
                                              bhū          +        sIC         +         t 
 
                                   7.3.84         7.2.1          2.4.77 
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: same as above. 
7.2.1 sici vr̥ ddhiḥ parasmaipadeṣu: the final sound iK of a verbal base is replaced with its 
vr̥ ddhi counterpart before a sIC that is followed by a parasmaipada affix. 
2.4.77 gātisthāghupābhūbhyaḥ sicaḥ parasmaipadeṣu: affix sIC is replaced with LUK when it 
is located after gā ‘to go’, sthā ‘to stand’, ghu ‘a root termed ghu’, pā ‘to drink’, or bhū ‘to be, 
become’ and before a parasmaipada affix. 

136 
 
There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.84 and 7.2.1. Since 7.2.1 has been taught for bases 
followed by sIC, it is more specific and thus wins. Now let us look at the relationship between 
7.2.1 and 2.4.77. 
If we apply 7.2.1 at this step, 2.4.77 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
2.4.77 at this step, 7.2.1 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of 
unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 2.4.77 and get bhū + t. bhū can now be 
called an aṅga with respect to t. Note that t cannot trigger guṇa of the ū of bhū due to the 
following rule:  
7.3.88 bhūsuvos tiṅi: a guṇa vowel does not replace the iK of bhū ‘to be’ and sū ‘to give birth 
to’ when a sārvadhātuka tiṄ affix follows.     
So only one rule from the aṅgādhikāra, namely 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ, which is 
triggered by t is applicable. It teaches that the udātta augment aṬ is attached to a verbal base 
when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥ Ṅ follow. On applying this rule, we get the correct form: abhūt.  
 
15. grah + tiP – ‘to obtain’, aorist third-person singular 
The first couple of steps of this derivation are similar to the previous one. I will mention them 
in brief here and focus on the step which involves conflict. 
grah + tiP  grah + t (3.4.100 itaś ca)  grah + cli + t (3.1.43 cli luṅi)  grah + sIC + t 
(3.1.44 cleḥ sic). 
grah       +       sIC       +       t 
 
                                                     7.2.3            7.2.35 
7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ: a vowel termed vr̥ ddhi replaces the vowel of vad ‘to speak’, 
vraj ‘to wander’, and a verbal base ending in a consonant, before a sIC which is followed by a 
parasmaipada affix. 
7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning 
with vaL (any consonant except y). 

137 
 
If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we attach 
the augment iṬ to sIC by 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step, 
due to 7.2.5: 
7.2.5 hmyantakṣaṇaśvasajāgr̥ ṇiśvyeditām: a vowel termed vr̥ ddhi does not come in place of 
the vowel of verbal bases (i) ending in h, m, y; or (ii) kṣaṇA ‘to harm’, śvasA ‘to breathe’ and 
jāgr̥  ‘to wake up’; or (iii) ending in the affix Ṇi; or (iv) śvi ‘to swell’; or (v) marked with E; 
before an iṬ-initial sIC which is followed by a parasmaipada affix.42 
In conclusion, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get grah + is + t. grah and is 
cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t, thus we can write grah + is 
as grahis. grahis is an aṅga with respect to t. The following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become 
applicable: 
grahis        +         t 
 
                                                       6.4.71                  7.3.96 
6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: same as above. 
7.3.96 astisico’pr̥ kte: augment īṬ is attached to a consonant-initial sārvadhātuka affix which 
consists of only one sound (apṛkta) and occurs after the verbal base as or affix sIC. 
There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2 we apply the RHS rule 
7.3.96 and get grahis + īt. At this step, we apply 6.4.71 and get agrahis + īt. Now that all 
possible rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have been applied, we apply 8.2.28 iṭa īṭi from the 
 
42 One may ask: why did Pāṇini compose 7.2.5 if 7.2.4 neṭi already prohibits vr̥ ddhi in such cases? It is 
true that by 7.2.4 neṭi, when the consonant-final base is followed by an iṬ-initial sIC, vr̥ ddhi is 
prohibited. But 7.2.7 ato halāder laghoḥ makes this optional for bases which start with a consonant and 
contain the light vowel a. Thus, Pāṇini has composed 7.2.5 to negate this optionality, or in other words, 
to prescribe the mandatory prohibition of vr̥ ddhi in the said circumstances.  

138 
 
tripādī which replaces the s between iṬ and īṬ with LOPA. This gives us the correct form: 
agrahiīt   agrahīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ).43   
 
16. gupU + tiP – ‘to hide’, aorist third-person singular44 
gup          +          tiP 
 
                                                                       3.1.43     3.4.100 
3.1.43 cli luṅi: same as above. 
3.4.100 itaś ca: same as above. 
There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 
rule 3.4.100 and get gup + t. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, gup is not an aṅga with respect to 
t, so rules like 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca which are taught in the aṅgādhikāra and which 
are triggered by t cannot apply here. By applying 3.1.43, we get gup + cli + t. Here the 
following rules are applicable: 
gup      +      cli       +      t 
 
                                                     7.3.86          3.1.44 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal base which ends 
in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a 
sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
3.1.44 cleḥ sic: same as above. 
There is no conflict between the two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 
rule 3.1.44 and get: gup + sIC + t. Here multiple rules are applicable: 
 
 
43 An important question arises here: how is it possible to apply 6.1.101, after applying 8.2.28, which 
belongs to the asiddha section? Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a satisfactory explanation 
for this. 
44 By 3.1.31 āyādaya ārdhadhātuke vā, āya can be optionally added to gupU here, but we will not 
discuss this option because it is not relevant to the present argument. 

139 
 
                                                gup          +        sIC         +         t 
 
                                   7.3.86         7.2.3          7.2.44 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above.  
7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ: same as above.  
7.2.44 svarati-sūti-sūyati-dhūñ-ūdito vā: augment iṬ is introduced to an ārdhadhātuka affix 
which begins with vaL (any consonant except y), provided the same occurs after svr̥  ‘resound’, 
ṣūṄ (adādi) ‘give birth to’, ṣūṄ (divādi) ‘give birth to’, dhūÑ ‘to shake’, and roots marked with 
Ū. 
There is an SOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 7.2.3. 7.2.3 has been taught specifically for a 
set of verbs followed by sIC, and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between 
7.2.44 and 7.2.3.  
If we apply 7.2.3 at this step, 7.2.44 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
7.2.44 at this step, then 7.2.3 will not be applicable at the following step, because of 7.2.4 neṭi 
which prohibits vr̥ ddhi of the vowel of a consonant-final base when the following sIC has taken 
the augment iṬ. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, 
we apply the RHS rule 7.2.44 and get gup + is + t. By 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we 
get gop + is + t. Note that, gop and is cannot undergo any other operations which are not 
triggered by t. Thus, we can write gop + is as gopis. gopis is an aṅga with respect to t.  
I will not go into the depth of the remaining steps of this derivation because we have seen these 
steps in a similar derivation above: gopis + t  gopis + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥ kte)  agopis + 
īt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ)  agopi + īt (8.2.28 iṭa īṭi)  agopīt (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe 
dīrghaḥ), which is the correct form.  
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.44, we get: gup + s + t  gaups + t (7.2.3 
vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ)  gaups + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥ kte)  agaupsīt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv 
aḍ udāttaḥ), which is also correct.

17. bhid + ta – ‘to break’, aorist third-person singular 
bhid + ta  bhid + cli + ta (3.1.43 cli luṅi)  
bhid + cli + ta 
 
                                                           7.3.86     3.1.44 
3.1.44 cleḥ sic: same as above. 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 
If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.44 will be applicable at the following step. But, if we apply 
3.1.44 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step because of 1.2.11: 
1.2.11 liṅsicāv ātmanepadeṣu: a LIṄ or sIC affix which begins with a jhaL (a non-nasal stop 
or a fricative) and occurs after a consonant preceded by an iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) is treated as if marked 
with K, before ātmanepada endings. 
By 1.2.11 sIC is treated as marked with K. So, if we apply 3.1.44 at this step, sIC, marked by 
K, will not trigger guṇa (here, 7.3.86), thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.44 and get bhid + s + ta  bhids + 
ta  abhids + ta (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ)  abhidta (8.2.26 jhalo jhali)  abhitta 
(8.4.55 khari ca), which is the correct form. 
 
18. ūrṇuÑ + tiP – ‘to cover’, simple future third-person singular 
ūrṇuÑ + tiP  ūrṇuÑ + sya + tiP (3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥ luṭoḥ). 
ūrṇu       +      sya      +      tiP 
 
                                                 7.3.84             7.2.35 
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) of a verbal base when 
a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning 
with vaL (any consonant except y). 

141 
 
If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step due to 1.2.3: 
1.2.3 vibhāṣorṇoḥ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is optionally treated as marked with Ṅ when 
it occurs after ūrṇuÑ.  
So, if we apply 7.2.35, and treat the resultant iṣya as marked with Ṅ, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 
7.3.84 will not be applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: ūrṇu + iṣya + ti  
ūrṇuviṣyati (6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau45). 
On the other hand, if we do not implement the optional rule 1.2.3, then the derivation proceeds 
as follows: ūrṇu + iṣya + tiP (7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ)  ūrṇo + iṣya + tip (7.3.84 
sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ)  ūrṇaviṣyati (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ). 
 
19. bhū + tiP – ‘to be’, āśīrliṅ (benedictive) third-person singular 
Since no vikaraṇa is added between bhū and tiP in āśīrliṅ forms, at this step, bhū can be called 
an aṅga with respect to tiP.  
                                                         bhū                +            t                   i 
 
                                                         7.3.84                    3.4.103          3.4.100 
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: same as above.  
3.4.103 yāsuṭ parasmaipadeṣūdātto ṅic ca: udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment yāsUṬ is attached 
to parasmaipada substitutes of LIṄ, and is treated as marked with Ṅ. 
3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 
3.4.100 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we 
apply the right most rule 3.4.100 and get bhū + t. Here two rules are applicable: 
 
45 The final i and u of Śnu, and of any verbal base, and of bhrū ‘brow’ are replaced with iyAṄ and uvAṄ, 
respectively, when an affix beginning with a vowel (aC) follows. 

142 
 
                                                         bhū                +            t                    
 
                                                         7.3.84                    3.4.103           
If we apply 7.3.84 at this step, 3.4.103 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
3.4.103 at this step, 7.3.84, which prescribes guṇa of ū, will not be applicable at the following 
step. This is because, yāsUṬ is marked with Ṅ and thus by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, guṇa is blocked.  
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.103 and get bhū + yāst. Here, again, 
two rules are applicable: 
bhūyā   [st] 
 
                                                                  8.2.23            8.2.29 
8.2.23 saṁyogāntasya lopaḥ: the final sound of a conjunct which occurs at the end of a pada 
is replaced with LOPA. 
8.2.29 skoḥ saṁyogādyor ante ca: the initial s and k of a conjunct which occurs at the end of a 
pada, or is followed by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative), is replaced with LOPA. 
Note that both 8.2.23 and 8.2.29 belong to the tripādī section. So, 8.2.29 is asiddha with respect 
to 8.2.23. However, this does not impact our method of resolving the SOI between them. I will 
discuss this in chapter 5.  
8.2.29 has been taught for a specific set of conjuncts and thus wins, thereby leading to the 
correct form: bhūyāt.

20. naś + tavyaT – ‘to perish’, optative passive participle 
 
na        ś     +     tavyaT 
 
  
                                                         7.1.60                  7.2.45 
7.1.60 masjinaśor jhali: augment nUM is attached to ṬUmasjI ‘to sink, immerse’ and naś ‘to 
perish’ when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 
7.2.45 radhādibhyaś ca: augment iṬ is optionally attached to ārdhadhātuka affixes beginning 
with vaL (any consonant except y) and occurring after the set of verbal roots beginning with 
radhA ‘to be subdued’.46 
If we apply 7.1.60 at this step, 7.2.45 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we 
apply 7.2.45 at this step, then the affix no longer begins with a jhaL sound, so 7.1.60 will not 
be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI 
conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.45 and get: naśitavya, which is the 
correct form. If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.45, we get: naṁṣṭavya, which is also 
correct. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
46 This set of roots includes naś. 

144 
 
21. tr̥ p + tumUN – ‘to be satisfied’, infinitive 
                                                  t           r̥                    p      +       tumUN 
 
                                                       7.3.86       6.1.59                7.2.45 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal base which ends 
in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a 
sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
6.1.59 anudāttasya cardupadhasyānyatarasyām: augment aM is optionally introduced to a 
verbal root which is anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha and has r̥  as its penultimate sound 
when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) and not marked with K, 
follows.  
7.2.45 radhādibhyaś ca: same as above. 
Let us first consider what happens if we implement both optional rules 6.1.59 and 7.2.45. 
Let us first look at the relationship between 7.3.86 and 6.1.59. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 
that will change r̥  to ar, and so 6.1.59, which applies only when the penultimate sound is r̥  will 
not be applicable at the following step. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step, r̥  will no longer be the 
penultimate sound, so 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of 
mutual blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
Now let us study the relationship between 6.1.59 and 7.2.45. If we apply 6.1.59 at this step, 
7.2.45 will still be applicable at the following step. If we apply 7.2.45 at this step, the affix will 
no longer begin with jhaL and thus 6.1.59 will not be applicable at the following step. This is 
a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
Lastly, 7.3.86 and 7.2.45 do not block each other.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 7.2.45 and get: tr̥ p + itum  
tarpitum (7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca), which is the correct form. 
If we implement the optional rule 7.2.45 but not the optional rule 6.1.59, we get the same form: 
tarpitum. However, if we implement 6.1.59 but not 7.2.45, we get tr̥ ap + tum (6.1.59)  
traptum (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci), which is also correct. If we do not implement both 7.2.45 and 
6.1.59, we get tarptum (7.3.86), which is also correct. 

145 
 
22. divU + Ktvā – ‘to gamble’, absolutive 
               divU      +       Ktvā 
 
                                                                  6.4.19                7.2.56  
6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca: ch and v of a base are replaced with ś and ūṬH, respectively, 
when KvI, or an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K 
or Ṅ, or beginning with a nasal, follows. 
7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is optionally attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root 
marked with U. 
If we apply 6.4.19 at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. If we attach 
augment iṬ to tvā by 7.2.56 at this step, then by 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ47, Ktvā cannot be treated as 
marked with K. Thus, 6.4.19 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of 
unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get: div + itvā. Since itvā 
cannot be treated as marked with K, it can no longer block guṇa and vr̥ ddhi (i.e., 1.1.5 kṅiti ca 
does not hold). Thus, by 7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca, we get devitvā, which is the correct 
form. 
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get: div + tvā  diū + tvā (6.4.19 chvoḥ 
śūḍ anunāsike ca)  dyūtvā (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci), which is also correct. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
47 Ktvā which has taken the iṬ augment is not treated as marked with K. 

146 
 
23. khanU + Ktvā – ‘to dig’, absolutive 
  khanU          +         Ktvā 
 
                                                           6.4.42                 7.2.56 
6.4.42 janasanakhanāṁ sañjhaloḥ: the final sound of janA ‘to generate’, sanA ‘to gain’, and 
khanU ‘to dig’, is replaced with ā when saN or an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-nasal stop 
or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
7.2.56 udito vā: same as above. 
If we apply 6.4.42 at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
7.2.56 at this step, the affix will no longer begin with jhaL and so 6.4.42 will not be applicable 
at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.56 and get khanitvā, which is the 
correct form. 
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, we get kha-ā + tvā  khātvā (6.1.101 akaḥ 
savarṇe dīrghaḥ), which is also correct. 
 
24. kr̥  + siP – ‘to make’, imperative second-person singular 
kr̥               +             siP 
 
                                                                      3.1.79      3.4.87 
3.1.79 tanādikr̥ ñbhya uḥ: affix u is added after verbal roots belonging to the set headed by tanU 
‘to stretch’ and also after kr̥ Ñ ‘to make’ when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥  follows. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not 
marked with P. 
There is no conflict between these rules.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get kr̥  + hi. Thereafter, the 
derivation proceeds as follows kr̥  + hi  kr̥  + u + hi (3.1.79 tanādikr̥ ñbhya uḥ)  karu + hi 
(7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ). karu is an aṅga with respect to hi, so the following 
rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable: 

147 
 
k    a   ru         +          hi 
 
                                                         6.4.110                  6.4.106              
6.4.110 ata ut sārvadhātuke: the a of base which is constituted by kr̥ , and ends in affix u, is 
replaced with u when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
6.4.106 utaś ca pratyayād asaṁyogapūrvāt: hi is replaced with LUK when it is preceded by a 
base that ends in affix u, such that u is not preceded by a conjunct. 
Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavat atrābhāt. I interpret 
this rule as: till 6.4.129 bhasya, any rule will treat any other rule here (i.e., in this section) as 
asiddhavat’. In my opinion, if A treats B as asiddhavat, A acknowledges the existence of B, 
but not the outcome of the application of B’. I will discuss this interpretation in detail in chapter 
5.  
Since 6.4.110 and 6.4.106 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with 
this case of DOI. 
If we apply 6.4.110 at this step, 6.4.106 will be applicable at the following step. But if we 
replace hi with LUK by 6.4.106, 6.4.110 will not be applicable at the following step48. This is 
a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.106 and get karu. Since 6.4.106 is 
asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.110, 6.4.110 does not acknowledge the outcome of the 
application of 6.4.106. Thus 6.4.110 applies, and we get the correct form: kuru.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
48 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya. 

148 
 
25. as + siP – ‘to be’, imperative (āśiṣi ‘benediction’) second-person singular  
as          +          siP 
 
                                                                      3.1.68     3.4.87 
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: same as above. 
There is no conflict between these rules.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get as + hi. Then, the 
derivation proceeds as follows: as + hi  as + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68 kartari śap)  as + hi (2.4.72 
adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Since as is an aṅga with respect to hi, the following rules from the 
aṅgādhikāra are applicable: 
a            s                        +                      hi 
 
                                   6.4.111     6.4.119                         7.1.35                 6.4.101   
6.4.111 śnasor allopaḥ: the a of affix ŚnaM and of root as, is replaced with LOPA when a 
sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
6.4.119 ghvasor ed dhāv abhyāsalopaś ca: the final sound of a verbal base termed ghu or of 
as, is replaced with e when affix hi follows, and abhyāsa (first of two reduplicated syllables) 
is replaced with LOPA. 
7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām: affixes tu and hi are optionally replaced with tātAṄ, 
provided benediction (āśiḥ) is denoted. 
6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her dhiḥ: hi is replaced with dhi when it occurs after root hu or after a 
verbal base ending in jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 
There is no conflict between 6.4.111 and 6.4.119.  
There is an SOI between 7.1.35 and 6.4.101. 7.1.35 is more specific because it has been taught 
with respect to benedictive forms. 
So now let us look at the relationship between 6.4.119 and 7.1.35. If we apply 6.4.119 at this 
step, then 7.1.35 will be applicable at the following step. If we replace hi with tātAṄ by 7.1.35 

149 
 
at this step, 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional 
blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right-most operation 7.1.35 (which defeats 
6.4.101 in SOI, as seen above) and get: as + tāt  stāt (6.4.111 śnasor allopaḥ), which is the 
correct form.   
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.1.35, the derivation proceeds as follows: 
a            s            +            hi 
 
                                               6.4.111     6.4.119               6.4.101    
There is no conflict between 6.4.111 and 6.4.119. Let us look at the relationship between 
6.4.119 and 6.4.101.  
If we apply 6.4.119 at this step, then 6.4.101 will not be applicable at the following step. If we 
apply 6.4.101 at this step, then 6.4.119 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a 
case of mutual blocking.  
Note that all three rules belong to the asiddhavat section. So, each rule can see the other two 
rules but not the outcome of the application of the other two rules. Since these rules can see 
one another, we can use 1.4.2 to solve the DOI between them.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right-most rule 6.4.101 and get as + dhi. The other 
two rules cannot see the outcome of the application of 6.4.101. They are still applicable: 
  a            s            +            dhi 
 
                                               6.4.111     6.4.119        
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.119 and get ae + dhi. Here, 6.4.111 
applies and we get the correct form edhi.

26. bhū + ta – ‘to be’, passive aorist third-person singular 
bhū + ta  bhū + cli + ta (3.1.43 cli luṅi49)  
bhū       +        cli        +          ta 
 
                                                7.3.84            3.1.66      
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final iK (i, u, ṛ, ḷ) of a verbal base when 
a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
3.1.66 ciṇ bhāvakarmaṇoḥ: CiṆ occurs in place of affix cli after a verbal base when the LUṄ 
substitute ta denoting bhāva ‘action’ or karman ‘object’ follows. 
There is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 
rule 3.1.66 and get bhū + CiṆ + ta. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: bhū + CiṆ 
+ ta  bhau + CiṆ + ta (7.2.115 aco ñṇiti50)  bhāv + CiṆ + ta (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ). 
Since bhāv and CiṆ cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by ta, we can 
write bhāv + CiṆ as bhāvi. By my interpretation of 1.4.13, bhāvi is an aṅga with respect to ta. 
Here, multiple rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 
                                                              bhāvi      +      ta 
 
                                                         6.4.71                6.4.104 
6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ: the udātta ‘high-pitched’ augment aṬ is attached to a verbal 
base when affixes LUṄ, LAṄ and LR̥ Ṅ follow. 
6.4.104 ciṇo luk: an affix which occurs after CiṆ is replaced with LUK. 
Note that both these rules fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt. They are 
asiddhavat with respect to each other. That is, each rule acknowledges the existence of the 
other rule, but not the outcome of the application of the other rule. 
 
49 Affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 
50 Note that, at this step, there is an SOI between 7.2.115 aco ñṇiti and 7.3.84 
sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ. However, I have not drawn a diagram to show this in the main text for 
the sake of brevity. Since 7.2.115 is conditioned by affixes marked with Ñ and Ṇ, it is more specific 
and thus wins.  

151 
 
Since 6.4.71 and 6.4.104 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with 
this case of DOI. 
If we apply 6.4.71 at this step, 6.4.104 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
6.4.104 at this step, the affix will be replaced with LUK, and so 6.4.71 will not be applicable at 
the following step51. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.104 and get: bhāvi. Since 6.4.104 is 
asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.71, 6.4.71 does not acknowledge the outcome of the application 
of 6.4.104. Consequently, 6.4.71 applies, and we get the correct form: abhāvi. 
 
27. krī + jhi – ‘to buy’, present third-person plural 
krī + jhi  krī + Śnā + jhi (3.1.81 kryādibhyaḥ śnā52)  krīnā + jhi. Now that krīnā is an 
aṅga with respect to jhi, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 
krīnā               +                jhi 
 
                                        6.4.112               6.4.113             7.1.3 
6.4.112 śnābhyastayor ātaḥ53: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base 
(abhyasta) is replaced with LOPA when a sārvadhātuka affix marked with K or Ṅ follows.  
6.4.113 ī haly aghoḥ: the final ā of a base which ends in Śnā or of a reduplicated base 
(abhyasta), excluding items termed ghu, is replaced with ī when a sārvadhātuka affix 
beginning with a consonant and marked with K or Ṅ follows.  
7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 
There is an SOI between 6.4.112 and 6.4.113. First let us identify the more specific i.e., winning 
rule. Then we will examine the DOI between the winning rule and 7.1.3.  
 
51 1.1.63 na lumatāṅgasya. 
52 Affix Śnā occurs after verbal roots belonging to the class headed by ḌUkrīÑ ‘to buy, barter’ when a 
sārvadhātuka affix which denotes kartr̥  follows. 
53 6.4.112 and 6.4.113 are applicable here because jhi is treated as marked with K / Ṅ by virtue of being 
an apit sārvadhātuka (cf. 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit). 

152 
 
6.4.113 is more specific because it is applicable only when the affix begins with a consonant, 
and thus wins. Now let us look at the DOI relationship between 6.4.113 and 7.1.3. 
If we apply 6.4.113 at this step, 7.1.3 will be applicable at the following step. However, if we 
apply 7.1.3 at this step, jhi will no longer begin with a consonant. Thus 6.4.113 will not be 
applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.3 and get: krīnā+ anti. Here, 6.4.112 
applies and we get krīṇanti54 which is the correct form.  
 
28. udvij + ta – ‘to fear’, simple future third-person singular 
  udvij       +       ta 
 
                                                                         3.1.33    3.4.79  
3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥ luṭoḥ: affixes sya and tāsI respectively occur after verbal bases when LR̥  and 
LUṬ follow. 
3.4.79 ṭita ātmanepadānāṁ ṭer e: the part that begins with the last vowel (ṭi)55 of an 
ātmanepada replacement of a lakāra marked with Ṭ is replaced with e. 
There is no conflict between these rules.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.79 and get udvij + te. Thereafter we 
apply 3.1.33 and get udvij + sya + te. Here two rules are applicable: 
                                                    udvij       +    sya     +       te 
 
                                                  7.3.86         7.2.35              
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces the iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal base which ends 
in the augment pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a 
sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
 
54 8.4.2 aṭkupvāṅnumvyavāye’pi. 
55 1.1.64 aco’ntyādi ṭi.   

153 
 
7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ: augment iṬ is attached to an ārdhadhātuka affix beginning 
with vaL (any consonant except y). 
If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 7.2.35 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
7.2.35 at this step, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step, because of the following 
rule: 
1.2.2 vija iṭ: an affix with initial augment iṬ is treated as if marked with Ṅ when it occurs after 
OvijI ‘to fear’.  
So, if we apply 7.2.35 at this step, the resultant isya, by 1.2.2, will be treated as marked with 
Ṅ. Consequently, thanks to 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.35 and get: udvijisya + te  
udvijiṣyate (8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ), which is the correct form. 
 
29. bhī + jhi – ‘to be afraid’, present third-person plural 
bhī + jhi  bhī + ŚaP + jhi (3.1.68 kartari śap)  bhī + ŚLU + jhi (2.4.75 juhotyādibhyaḥ 
śluḥ)  bhībhī + ŚLU + jhi (6.1.10 ślau)  bhibhī + ŚLU + jhi (7.4.59 hrasvaḥ56). 
At this point, bhibhī and ŚLU cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by 
jhi. Thus, we can write bhibhī + ŚLU as bhibhī. In bhibhī + jhi, bhibhī can now be called an 
aṅga with respect to jhi. Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become applicable: 
                                 bh       i       bh      ī                    +                 jh       i 
 
                             6.4.115                  7.1.3                  7.1.4 
6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām: the final ī of bhī is optionally replaced with i when an affix 
beginning with a consonant, and marked with K or Ṅ follows.57 
 
56 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart. 
57 By virtue of being an apit sārvadhātuka, jhi is treated as marked with K / Ṅ (cf. 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam 
apit). 
 

154 
 
7.1.3 jho’ntaḥ: a jh which is the initial sound of an affix is replaced with ant. 
7.1.4 ad abhyastāt: when preceded by a reduplicated base, a jh which is the initial sound of an 
affix is replaced with at. 
There is an SOI relationship between 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. Since 7.1.4 has been taught specifically 
for reduplicated bases, it is more specific and thus wins. 
Let us consider the relationship between 7.1.4 and 6.4.115. If we apply 6.4.115 at this step, 
7.1.4 will be applicable at the following step. But if, by 7.1.4, we replace jh with at, which 
starts with a vowel, 6.4.115 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of 
unidirectional blocking, and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.4 (which defeats 7.1.3 in SOI, as seen 
above) and get: bhibhī + ati  bhibhy + ati (6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci). Now that all rules from the 
sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, we can apply 8.4.54 abhyāse car ca from the tripādī. This 
gives us bibhyati, which is the correct form.  
Note that the optional rule 6.4.115 bhiyo’nyatarasyām, despite being applicable, does not 
actually end up applying in this derivation. So even if we had not implemented the optional 
rule 6.4.115, we would still have got the same form, i.e., bibhyati. 
 
30. ṇijIR + tiP – ‘to purify’, aorist third-person singular 
ṇijIR           +         tiP 
 
                                                     6.1.65         3.1.43    3.4.100 
6.1.65 ṇo naḥ:  the initial ṇ of a verbal root when taught in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with n. 
3.1.43 cli luṅi: affix cli is added to a verbal root when LUṄ follows. 
3.4.100 itaś ca: the i of a replacement of any lakāra marked with Ṅ, is replaced with LOPA. 
There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most 
rule 3.4.100 and get: ṇijIR + t. Here the following rules are applicable: 
 
 

155 
 
ṇijIR           +         t 
 
                                                     6.1.65           3.1.43     
There is no conflict between these rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 
3.1.43 and get ṇij + cli + t. Here the following rules are applicable: 
                                   ṇ               i            jIR           +      cli       +       t 
 
                              6.1.65        7.3.86                 3.1.57              3.1.44 
6.1.65 ṇo naḥ: same as above. 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 
3.1.44 cleḥ sic: cli is replaced with sIC. 
3.1.57 irito vā: affix cli is optionally replaced with aṄ after verbal roots marked with IR when 
a parasmaipada replacement of LUṄ which denotes kartr̥  follows.   
6.1.65 is not in conflict with the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between 3.1.44 and 
3.1.57. Since 3.1.57 has been specifically taught for roots marked with IR, it wins. 
Let us consider the DOI relationship between 7.3.86 and 3.1.57. If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 
3.1.57 will be applicable at the following step. But if we replace cli with aṄ by 3.1.57, then by 
1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step.  This is a case of unidirectional 
blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the right most operation 3.1.57 (which defeats 3.1.44 
in SOI, as seen above). We get: ṇij + aṄ + t  nij + aṄ + t (6.1.65).  nij and aṄ cannot undergo 
any other operations which are not triggered by t, so we can write nij + aṄ as nija. nija is an 
aṅga with respect to t. Thus, we apply 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ and get anijat, which is 
the correct form. 
If we do not implement the optional rule 3.1.57 irito vā, the derivation proceeds as follows: ṇij 
+ cli + t  ṇij + sIC + t (3.1.44)  ṇaij + s + t (7.2.3 vadavrajahalantasyācaḥ)  naij + s 

156 
 
+ t (6.1.65 ṇo naḥ)  naijs + īt (7.3.96 astisico’pr̥ kte)  anaikṣīt (6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ 
udāttaḥ)58, which is also correct.  
 
31. sic + tiP – ‘to sprinkle’, aorist third-person singular 
This derivation is very similar to the previous one so I will simply focus on the part involving 
DOI conflict. In the rest of the steps, if two rules are simultaneously applicable, I choose the 
RHS rule in case of DOI and the more specific rule in case of SOI. 
sic + tip  sic + t (3.4.100 itaś ca)  sic + cli + t (3.1.43 cli luṅi) 
sic        +        cli          +           a 
 
                                            7.3.86                 3.1.53 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: same as above. 
3.1.53 lipisicihvaś ca: affix cli is replaced with aṄ after verbal roots lip ‘to coat, smear’, sic ‘to 
pour out, sprinkle’ or hveÑ ‘to call’ when LUṄ which denotes kartr̥  follows. 
If we apply 7.3.86 at this step, 3.1.53 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
3.1.53 at this step, then by 1.1.5 kṅiti ca, 7.3.86 will not be applicable at the following step. 
This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.1.53 and get sic + aṄ + t. sic and aṄ 
cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by t. Thus sic + aṄ can be written 
as sica. Thereafter 6.4.71 luṅlaṅlr̥ ṅṣv aḍ udāttaḥ from the aṅgādhikāra applies, leading to the 
correct form, asicat.   
 
 
 
 
58 In the interest of brevity, I have omitted to mention certain phonological processes here, which lead 
us from naijs to naikṣ.

32. vanU + Ktvā – ‘to desire’, absolutive 
v                 a                 n            +            Ktvā 
 
                                                     6.4.15         6.4.37                     7.2.56   
 
6.4.15 anunāsikasya kvijhaloḥ kṅiti: the penultimate vowel of a base which ends in a nasal 
(anunāsika), is replaced with its long counterpart when affix KvI, or an affix beginning with 
jhaL ‘a non-nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base 
marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots 
headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL ‘a non-
nasal stop or a fricative’ and marked with K or Ṅ follows. 
7.2.56 udito vā: augment iṬ is optionally attached to affix Ktvā when it follows a verbal root 
marked with U. 
Let us consider the relationship of 7.2.56 with the other two rules. If we apply 6.4.15 or 6.4.37 
at this step, 7.2.56 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 7.2.56 at this step, 
then then both 6.4.14 and 6.4.37 will not be applicable at the following step. Thus, 7.2.56 
unidirectionally blocks both 6.4.15 and 6.4.37 and is in a DOI conflict with both of them. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the right most rule 7.2.56 and get vanitvā, which is the 
correct form. 
If we do not implement the optional rule 7.2.56, the derivation proceeds as follows:  
v                 a                 n            +            Ktvā 
 
                                                      6.4.15         6.4.37  
If we apply 6.4.15 at this step, 6.4.37 will be applicable at the following step. But if we apply 
6.4.37 at this step, 6.4.15 will not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of 
unidirectional blocking and of DOI conflict.   
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.37 and get vatvā, which is also correct. 
  

158 
 
33. āhan + iṬ – ‘to hit’, optative first-person singular 
āhan            +                                          iṬ 
 
                                                          3.1.68                    3.4.106              3.4.102 
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.4.102 liṅas sīyuṭ: a substitute of LIṄ receives the augment sīyUṬ. 
3.4.106 iṭo’t: iṬ, which is the first-person singular ātmanepada substitute of LIṄ, is replaced 
with aT. 
3.1.68 neither blocks nor is blocked by the other rules. There is an SOI relationship between 
3.4.106 and 3.4.102, and 3.4.106 wins because it has been specifically taught for iṬ.  
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.106 (which defeats 3.4.102 in SOI, 
as stated above) and get āhan + aT. Here two rules are applicable: 
āhan             +              aT 
 
                                                                       3.1.68        3.4.102 
As stated before, there is no conflict between these two rules. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, 
we apply the RHS rule 3.4.102 and get āhan + sīya. Thereafter the derivation proceeds as 
follows: āhan + sīya  āhan + ŚaP + sīya (3.1.68 kartari śap)  āhan + sīya (2.4.72 
adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Now āhan can be called an aṅga with respect to sīya. Thus, the 
following rules from the aṅgādhikāra are applicable: 
āha        n          +          s        īya 
 
                                                            6.4.37              7.2.79 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: same as above. 
7.2.79 liṅaḥ salopo’nantyasya: the non-final s of a sārvadhātuka substitute of LIṄ is replaced 
with LOPA. 
If we apply 6.4.37 at this step, 7.2.79 will still be applicable at the following step. But if we 
apply 7.2.79 at this step, āhan will no longer be followed by a jhaL sound and thus 6.4.37 will 

159 
 
not be applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, and thus of 
DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.2.79 and get āhan + īya. Thereafter, 
the derivation proceeds as follows: āhn + īya (6.4.98 gamahanajanakhanaghasāṁ lopaḥ kṅity 
anaṅi59)  āghnīya (7.3.54 ho hanter ñṇinneṣu60), which is the correct form.  
 
34. vyadh + Ktvā – ‘to hurt’, absolutive 
 v                        y                       adh               +                 Ktvā 
 
                       6.1.16                6.1.16                                                         
6.1.16 grahijyāvayivyadhivaṣṭivicativr̥ ścatipr̥ cchatibhr̥ jjatīnāṁ ṅiti ca: verbal roots grahA ‘to 
grab, seize’, jyā ‘to decay, grow old’, vay (a substitute of veÑ ‘to weave’ by 2.4.41 veño vayiḥ), 
vyadhA ‘to pierce, hurt’, vaśA ‘to shine’, vyacA ‘to deceive’, OvraścŪ ‘to cut’, pracchA ‘to 
ask’ and bhrasjA ‘to roast’ undergo samprasāraṇa when an affix marked with K and Ṅ follows. 
Note that both v and y can potentially undergo samprasāraṇa by 6.1.16. If we apply 6.1.16 to 
v at this step, 6.1.16 will be applicable to y at the following step. But if we apply 6.1.16 to y at 
this step, then by 6.1.37 na samprasāraṇe samprasāraṇam, 6.1.16 will not be applicable to v 
at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking and thus of DOI conflict. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.1.16 to y and get viadh + tvā.  
Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: vidh + tvā (6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca)  
vidhdhvā (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor dho’dhaḥ)  viddhvā (8.4.53 jhalāṁ jaś jhaśi), which is the 
correct form.

4.4 Examples of SOI    
We have already looked at several examples of SOI while discussing examples of DOI conflict. 
Here I will present a few more examples. As I have done earlier, I will spell out and examine 
the conditions in which the rules apply and then determine which of the two rules is more 
specific. 
 
(1) cal + tiP – ‘to walk’, simple future third-person singular  
cal        +        tiP 
 
                                                        3.1.33                3.1.68 
3.1.33 syatāsī lr̥ luṭoḥ: affixes sya and tāsI respectively occur after verbal roots when LR̥  and 
LUṬ follow. 
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.1.33 
(when LR̥  and LUṬ follow) 
3.1.68 
(when LR̥  and LUṬ follow) 
(when other sārvadhātuka affixes follow)  
The conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we 
compare the two rules themselves. 3.1.33 has been taught specifically for LR̥  and LUṬ. So, it 
is more specific and thus wins. We get cal + sya + ti  caliṣyati (7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ 
valādeḥ), which is the correct form.  
 
 
 
 

161 
 
(2) vad + miP – ‘to speak’, imperative first-person singular 
 vad                         +                         miP 
 
                                                                      3.1.68         3.4.89             3.4.92 
3.1.68 kartari śap: same as above. 
3.4.89 mer niḥ: a miP substitute of LOṬ is replaced with ni.  
3.4.92 āḍ uttamasya pic ca:  a first-person substitute of LOṬ receives the initial augment āṬ 
which is treated as marked with P. 
3.1.68 is not in conflict with 3.4.89 or 3.4.92. By my interpretation of 1.4.2 we should perform 
the RHS operation. But which one of the two RHS rules, namely 3.4.89 and 3.4.92, should we 
apply? Let us examine the SOI between 3.4.89 and 3.4.92. 
3.4.89 
miP (replacement of LOṬ) 
3.4.92  
miP (replacement of LOṬ) 
other first-person affixes (replacements of LOṬ) 
The conditions highlighted in bold are exactly the same. This is a case of SOI-M. Thus, we 
compare the two rules themselves. 3.4.89 has been taught specifically for miP. So, it is more 
specific and thus wins. Thus, we get vad + ni. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: 
vad + ni  vad + āni (3.4.92 āḍ uttamasya pic ca)  vad + ŚaP + āni (3.1.68 kartari śap)  
vadāni (6.1.97 ato guṇe), which is the correct form.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

162 
 
(3) tṝ + tiP – ‘to cross’, present third-person singular 
tṝ + tiP  tṝ + ŚaP + tiP (3.1.68 kartari śap) 
  tṝ           +        ŚaP            +             tiP 
 
                          7.3.84                  7.1.100 
7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ: guṇa replaces the final sound iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥) of a verbal 
base when a sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ: ṝ which occurs at the end of a verbal base is replaced with i. 
Note that, we have to take into account rules like 1.1.5 kṅiti ca [which prohibits guṇa and 
vr̥ ddhi of the iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) of a verbal base when the following affix is marked with K, G or Ṅ] 
when determining the exact conditions in which the aforementioned rules are applicable. 
Because of 1.1.5, 7.3.84 is applicable only when the affix is not marked with K, G or Ṅ. 
7.3.84 
ṝ + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka) (not marked with K, G, Ṅ) 
other iK sounds + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka) (not marked with K, G, Ṅ) 
7.1.100 
ṝ + affix (sārvadhātuka or ārdhadhātuka)  
The conditions highlighted in bold are not the same. Thus, this is a case of SOI-L. 7.3.84 is 
more specific because it is applicable only if the affix is not marked with K, G or Ṅ whereas 
7.1.100 is applicable regardless of whether the affix is marked with K, G or Ṅ. Thus, 7.3.84 
wins, giving the correct form tarati (cf. 1.1.51 ur aṇ raparaḥ). 
Let us now consider Cardona’s (1970: 57-58) method of deriving this form. He uses a principle 
that he calls ‘limited blocking’ to deal with this aforementioned SOI. He explains it as follows: 
“though a rule R2 as a whole does not state an apavāda of an R1, as a whole, it can do so for 
some operands or environments common to both”. Further, he says: “(Consider) rules: 7.3.84 
sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ and 7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ. By the latter, the ṝ of an aṅga which 
is a verb root is replaced with i. The rules are not related as utsarga and apavāda in their 
entirety: the operands of 7.3.84 are i, u, r̥  while that of 7.1.100 is ṝ. Nor are the contexts 
identical. Although 7.1.100 operates when the root is followed by any affix introduced after it 

163 
 
and sārvadhātuka and ārdhadhātuka affixes, the contexts for 7.3.84, include all post-radical 
affixes, the context of 7.3.84 is restricted by 1.1.5 (kṅiti ca). In the case of the single shared 
operand (ṝ), then, 7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84 (sic)61, since all the contexts of the former are 
included in those of the latter. Thus, given the root stṝ followed by the affix ana, one obtains 
the desired form staraṇa- ‘spreading’ without recourse to paratva.” 
Kiparsky (1991: 350-351) criticizes this solution, saying that using such arguments, one could 
have arrived at exactly the opposite conclusion. He says, “So (Cardona’s statement) is 
compatible with two different procedures yielding opposite results:  
“If the environments of R2 are properly included in the environments of R1, and the operands 
of R1, are properly included in the operands of R2, then  
a. R2 blocks R1, (for the environments of R2 are properly included in the environments of R1, 
in the shared operand domain).  
b. R1 blocks R2 (for the operands of R1 are properly included in the operands of R2 in the shared 
environment domain).  
“In case (a) of Cardona 1970 (p. 57) the two rules are: 7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ 
(guṇaḥ) and 7.1.100 ṝta id dhātoḥ. So, Cardona applies procedure a: “in the case of the single 
shared operand (ṝ) then, 7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84 [sic – this is evidently a slip and he must 
have meant to say ‘7.3.84 will counter 7.1.100’], since all the contexts of the former are 
included in those of the later”. If the facts were the other way round (i.e., if the outcome was 
*stiraṇa), he would have said “in the case of the single shared context (non-kit suffixes), 
7.1.100 will counter 7.3.84, since all the operands of the former are included in those of the 
latter (procedure b)”. 
I think that Cardona’s limited blocking principle is similar to my method of dealing with SOI. 
However, Kiparsky correctly points out that the explanation offered by Cardona is ambiguous. 
On the other hand, my solution overcomes such ambiguity by following the clearly defined 
procedure which I have developed and used to tackle all examples of SOI in this thesis.  
This brings us to the end of our survey of SOI and DOI examples from derivations of finite 
verbs and primary derivatives.  
 
61 As pointed out by Kiparsky, Cardona means the exact opposite, that is, ‘7.3.84 will counter 7.1.100’.

4.5 Selection of Examples 
I have presented examples of both SOI conflict and DOI conflict in chapters 2, 3 and 4, of this 
thesis. Instead of focusing on only those steps that involve conflict, I have performed entire 
derivations, right from the first step to the last one – drawing diagrams for each step where two 
or more rules are simultaneously applicable. Before closing this chapter, I must discuss the 
process through which I conducted my searches for examples, the rationale behind the choice 
of these examples and also the distributional patterns I noticed in this process. 
I performed numerous derivations from the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī and chose those which 
involve examples of conflict. Having studied the various prakaraṇas ‘chapters’ of this text, 
namely those on sandhi, subanta, taddhitānta, samāsa, tiṅanta and kr̥ danta, I have selected a 
diverse and representative set of examples to the best of my abilities. In order to avoid 
redundancy, I have excluded those examples which are only superficially different from those 
included in this thesis.  
To show that my method can tackle all kinds of conflicts in various derivational contexts, I 
have tried to strike a balance:  
(i) between short derivations which involve only two or three steps and fewer cases of same-
step interaction, and long ones which involve many steps and several cases of same step 
interaction;  
(ii) between simple examples which help the reader gain conceptual clarity and complex ones 
which demonstrate the potency of my solution; and 
(iii) between examples which have been extensively discussed in traditional literature and 
examples which I have newly spotted during my research. 
To underscore the far-reaching impact of my research: 
(i) I have given precedence to derivations which involve popular, broad, general and widely-
applicable rules, whilst also ensuring the inclusion of derivations which involve rarely 
applicable and highly specific rules.  
(ii) I have prioritized the exposition of those examples which highlight the contrast between 
my method and the traditional method. 
(iii) I have paid special attention to certain challenging examples discussed in the Mahābhāṣya, 
the Kāśikā, Cardona (1970), Kiparsky (1982), Pataskar (1985), Bronkhorst (2004), Joshi and 

165 
 
Kiparsky (2005) etc., with the aim of showing that my method is singlehandedly able to 
overcome a wide variety of problems associated with this topic. In Appendix D, I provide more 
information on the examples which are present in some of these sources and have also been 
discussed by me.   
 
4.6 Distribution of Examples of Conflict 
Now let us examine the distribution of examples of conflict across various kinds of derivations 
(e.g., subanta, kr̥ danta etc.). Since Pāṇini uses the general-exception framework throughout 
the Aṣṭādhyāyī, we find cases of SOI conflict in all kinds of derivations. And while we might 
find more examples of SOI conflict in some kinds of derivations than others, we do not come 
across any unique or peculiar patterns that merit discussion here. 
So, I will focus on the distribution of DOI conflicts in Pāṇinian derivations in this section. Let 
us inquire why, on the whole, DOI conflicts, and especially certain kinds of DOI conflicts (e.g., 
mutual blocking), are found more frequently in certain kinds of derivations than others. I 
request the reader to bear in mind that I will be making some broad generalizations here in 
order to paint an overarching picture. Therefore, my statements will not be entirely accurate. 
Since we are talking about DOI-conflict here, I will not touch upon those instances of DOI 
which do not involve conflict.    
To start with, let us consider subanta derivations. 
‘nominal base + declensional affix’ 
 
                                                           A                          B 
We will focus on cases where the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound of 
the affix, and the application of B to the affix is triggered by the last sound of the base. If the 
first sound of the affix changes, A is not applicable to the base anymore and if the last sound 
of the base changes, B is not applicable to the affix anymore. Therefore, when two such rules 
are simultaneously applicable in subanta derivations, A to the base and B to the affix, both 
rules block each other, leading to a situation of DOI conflict. See examples 1-5 and 9 of section 
2.7, chapter 2.  
In other cases, we find that the application of B to the affix is triggered simply by the 
grammatical gender, word category (e.g., pronoun) etc. of the base. In such a case, even if the 

166 
 
base undergoes phonological change, B will still be applicable at the following step. On the 
contrary, we observe that the application of A to the base is triggered by the first sound or the 
mere presence of an affix. So, if the affix is deleted, for example, by LUK, or if its first sound 
changes, then A will no longer be applicable at the following step. These are cases of 
unidirectional blocking.  See examples 6-8 and 13 of section 2.7, chapter 2. 
Thus, we see both kinds of examples of DOI conflict, namely those of mutual blocking and 
those of unidirectional blocking, in subanta derivations. Note that I have overlooked, for the 
sake of simplicity, examples of DOI conflict where both rules apply to two different parts of 
the base or to two different parts of the affix respectively. 
Let us contrast this with tiṅanta derivations. One of the early steps of these derivations looks 
like this: 
 
‘verbal base + vikaraṇa + finite ending’ 
 
 
                                                     C                 D                E 
Vikaraṇas on the whole do not undergo many changes. Even when they do, the application of 
D (which may teach replacement with LUK or other substitutes, augmentation, etc.) is not 
triggered by the last sound of the verbal root. So even if the verbal root undergoes some 
changes, D will still be applicable to the vikaraṇa at the following step. On the other hand, the 
application of C (which may entail guṇa, samprasāraṇa, augmentation, lengthening of the 
penultimate vowel, deletion of nasal etc.) is dependent on the existence of the vikaraṇa, its 
being marked with K or Ṅ, etc. So, if the vikaraṇa undergoes certain changes, such as 
replacement with LUK or attachment of certain augments like iṬ which annul the effect of K/Ṅ 
(cf. 1.2.18 na ktvā seṭ), C will not be applicable to the base at the following step. These are 
cases of unidirectional blocking.  
Most rules (E) which are applicable to finite endings at this stage, are triggered by the type of 
lakāra that the ending has replaced, whether that lakāra is marked with Ṭ or Ṅ, the number and 
person of the ending, whether the ending is parasmaipada or ātmanepada etc. They do not 
block and are not blocked by other rules (for example, see rules 3.4.77 – 3.4.112 of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī). So, we will not focus on them here. 
 
 

167 
 
Once the aṅga is ready, we get: 
aṅga          +         finite ending 
 
                                                       F                          G 
The application of F (such as guṇa, vr̥ ddhi, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by the existence of 
the affix, the first sound of the affix, whether or not it is marked with K / Ṅ etc. Thus, if the 
affix undergoes certain changes, F is not applicable at the following step. But G is not triggered 
by the last sound of the aṅga. Thus, even if the aṅga undergoes certain changes, G is still 
applicable at the following step. This is a case of unidirectional blocking.   
Let us now look at kr̥ danta derivations. 
                                            verbal base      +         kr̥ t affix        
 
                                                       H                          I 
The application of H (such as guṇa, samprasāraṇa etc.) is triggered by / depends on the first 
sound of the affix, whether it has taken the augment iṬ, whether it is marked with K / Ṅ etc. 
Thus, if the affix undergoes certain changes, H is not applicable at the following step. Let us 
call H the dependent rule. On the other hand, I is triggered by the first sound of the affix itself 
(e.g., 7.2.35 ārdhadhātukasyeḍ valādeḥ) and other factors. Essentially, the application of I is 
not dependent on the final sound of the base. So even if the base changes, I is still applicable 
at the following step. Let us call I the independent rule. This is a case of unidirectional blocking, 
where the independent rule blocks the dependent rule.  
Before we proceed further, notice that, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking in DOI 
discussed in the thesis, it is the RHS rule which unidirectionally blocks the LHS rule, and not 
vice-versa.62 This is because, it is the RHS rule which is independent and it is the LHS rule 
which is dependent. In other words, in almost all cases of unidirectional blocking, the 
applicability of the RHS rule does not depend on whether the penultimate or last sound of the 
 
62 This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the nitya rule defeats the anitya rule, 
always correctly resolves cases of DOI conflict involving unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is 
applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2, 
the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule) defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule). 

168 
 
base changes, but the applicability of the LHS rule does depend on whether the affix is marked 
with K / Ṅ, whether it starts with a vowel, whether it has taken the augment iṬ etc. 
Coming back to the larger theme of this section, we see that almost all cases of DOI conflict in 
both tiṅanta and kr̥ danta derivations involve only unidirectional blocking. This can be 
observed in the examples discussed in section 4.3. We rarely come across examples of DOI 
conflict that involve mutual blocking. One such exception is example 21 of section 4.3 of this 
chapter, which does involve mutual blocking.  
To sum up my observations, we find examples of both mutual and unidirectional blocking in 
subanta derivations, but of unidirectional blocking alone in tiṅanta and kr̥ danta derivations.  
As seen in this thesis, we find relatively fewer examples of DOI conflict in taddhitānta and 
samāsa derivations than we do in subanta, tiṅanta and kr̥ danta sections. How can we explain 
this phenomenon?  
Let us first answer this question in the context of samāsa derivations. The samāsa template is 
‘[(base1 suP1) (base2 suP2)] + suP3’. suP1 and suP2 are replaced with LUK by 2.4.71 supo 
dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘base1 base2 + suP3’. Given that the only remaining 
affix, i.e., suP3 is also a suP affix, there is almost no scope for any other conflicts to arise apart 
from those that can potentially arise in subanta derivations. The only exceptions to this are 
those cases wherein the uttarapada can potentially trigger changes in the pūrvapada (see 
examples 1 and 8 of section 3.2, chapter 3). This explains why we find very few examples of 
DOI conflict which are exclusive to samāsa derivations, i.e., which are not already found in 
subanta derivations. 
In taddhitānta derivations too, we find very few examples DOI conflict. Even these examples 
are quite similar to each other (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3) and arise because of 
the nominal inflection of taddhitānta forms. Why is this the case? The majority of taddhita 
rules actually teach addition of taddhita affixes, and not any substitutions or modifications. The 
taddhita template is ‘(nominal base + suP) + taddhita affix’. suP is replaced with LUK by 
2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ. Thus, we are left with ‘nominal base + taddhita affix’. 
nominal base        +        taddhita affix 
  
                                                        J                                    L 

169 
 
Taddhita affixes undergo very few, generic changes by rules (L) like by 7.1.2 āyaneyīnīyiyaḥ 
phaḍhakhacchaghāṁ pratyayādīnām, which are independent of the final sound of the nominal 
base. So, any change in the base by rule J cannot block these operations (L) on taddhita affixes.  
The nominal bases preceding taddhita affixes can also undergo certain general changes by rules 
(J) such as 7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ, 7.2.118 kiti ca etc. which do not depend on the first 
sound of the taddhita affix for their application, and thus are not blocked by L in case of DOI. 
And even those operations (J) such as 6.4.146 or guṇaḥ and 6.4.148 yasyeti ca, which are 
triggered by the first sound of the following taddhita affix, are seldom blocked, simply because 
the following taddhita affixes themselves undergo very few changes. So, barring replacement 
with LUK (see examples 3-7 of section 3.2, chapter 3), most changes in the taddhita affix 
cannot block these operations (J) on the nominal base. Since there is little scope for DOI 
blocking between J and L, we come across very few examples of DOI conflict in taddhita 
derivations.

Chapter Five 
5.1 Traditional Views on Asiddha and Asiddhavat  
In the previous chapters, I have shed light on how I think Pāṇini perceives the interactions 
between simultaneously applicable rules and more specifically, how he resolves cases of SOI 
and DOI. In this process, I have also discussed my interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam.  
In this chapter, I will dwell on three very important rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, which deal with 
the concepts of asiddha and asiddhavat. 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham 
teach the former and 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt the latter. I will discuss both the traditional 
interpretation of these rules and my own interpretation of them. I will also demonstrate how 
these rules impact SOI and DOI, if at all they do, and how they interact with (my interpretation 
of) 1.4.2.  
Let me start by presenting the English translation of these three rules as per the traditional 
interpretations. To highlight the differences of opinion within the tradition, I will make relevant 
comments on what texts like Mahābhāṣya, Kāśikā, Siddhāntakaumudī and Nyāsa say about 
these rules. 
6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ (ekaḥ pūrvaparayoḥ saṁhitāyām): a single replacement (ekaḥ) in 
place of the preceding and the following sound segments (pūrvaparayoḥ) in continuous 
utterance (saṁhitāyām) is suspended1 (asiddhaḥ) with respect to any potential replacement 
with ṣ or insertion of augment tUK (ṣatva-tuk-or). 
Here, should the kārya (i.e., ‘operation’, or more aptly, ‘outcome of application of the rule’) be 
suspended or the śāstra (i.e., the rule) itself? In traditional literature, if the kārya is suspended, 
this is called kāryāsiddhi, whereas if the śāstra is suspended, this is called śāstrāsiddhi. 
According to the Kāśikā, asiddha implies kāryāsiddhi2, but according to the 
Siddhāntakaumudī, asiddha stands for śāstrāsiddhi3.4 
 
1 When A is suspended with respect to B, B cannot acknowledge A. 
2 ṣatve tuki ca kartavye ekādeśo’siddho bhavati, siddhakāryaṁ na karoti ity arthaḥ. 
3 ṣatve tuki ca kartavye ekādeśaśāstram asiddhaṁ syāt. 
4 In his commentary on 8.2.1, Rama Nath Sharma (2003, Vol. 6, p. 476) says, “The asiddhatva of 8.2.1 
pūrvatrāsiddham is thus accepted as suspension of rules (sāstrāsiddhatva). Neo-grammarians such as 

171 
 
8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham: that which is taught from here onwards is suspended (asiddham) with 
respect to what precedes it (pūrvatra).   
As per the tradition’s interpretation, 8.2.1 can be rewritten as follows: 
Q is suspended with respect to P if: 
(i) Q is taught after P in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, and 
(ii) Q is taught after 8.2.1 in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. 
Here, again, the Kāśikā favours the kāryāsiddhi interpretation, whereas the Siddhāntakaumudī 
prefers the śāstrāsiddhi interpretation. There is some discussion in Nyāsa on 8.2.1 about 
whether asiddha stands for kāryāsiddhi or for śāstrāsiddhi. 
6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt: that which is taught in the section starting here and extending up 
to bh (ā bhāt)5 is suspended (asiddhavat)6, if both rules have a samānāśraya ‘common 
substratum’ (atra). 
According to the Kāśikā on 6.4.22, we must infer samānāśrayatva from the presence of word 
atra.7 The Nyāsa glosses āśraya as nimitta ‘cause’. If this is the case, samānāśraya would 
mean ‘common cause’. However, I do not think this is the correct interpretation. I will explain 
my understanding of the meaning of samānāśraya later in this chapter, when discussing a 
germane example.  
On 6.4.22, Kātyāyana presents two different views on the meaning of the word atra. One view 
is that it stands for samānāśrayatva8. The other opinion is that atra has been used to indicate 
 
Nāgeśa and Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita accept this view. Earlier grammarians, which also includes authors of the 
Kāśikāvr̥ tti, accept the kāryāsiddhatva view.” 
5 There is some controversy about the meaning of ā bhāt. We will examine this topic later in this chapter. 
6 Kāśikā’s interpretation alludes to the rules which are asiddhavat, but does not mention the rules with 
respect to which these rules are asiddhavat. We are left to answer the ‘with respect to what?’ question 
on our own. 
7 atreti samānāśrayatvapratipattyartham. 
8 Explaining why asiddhavat is not applicable in a certain context, Kātyāyana says (vt. 12) 
samānāśrayavacanāt siddham ‘[despite being placed in the section headed by 6.4.22] it (i.e., this rule) 
is siddha [and not asiddhavat] because [asiddhavat has been taught only in regard with] 
samānāśrayatva, [and here the samānāśrayatva condition has not been met]’ (Mbh III.190.22). 

172 
 
that it is with respect to the rules taught atra ‘here’ (in the section headed by 6.4.22) that the 
rules of this section (i.e., those rules headed by 6.4.22) are asiddhavat.9 In other words, if atra 
had not been mentioned, the rules taught in this section would have become asiddhavat even 
with respect to rules lying outside this section, such as 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ10, which is not 
desirable11, hence the need to state ‘atra’. We can say that atra, according to this view, stands 
for ‘with respect to the rules taught here (i.e., in the section headed by 6.4.22)’. 
Both the Kāśikā and the Siddhāntakaumudī interpret ā bhāt, not as ‘up to 6.4.129 bhasya’, but 
instead as ‘up to the end of the section headed by 6.4.129 bhasya’. The jurisdiction of 6.4.129 
continues up to 6.4.175, which is the end of 6.4. Thus, according to the Kāśikā, ā bhāt implies 
‘up to the end of 6.4’.12 On the other hand, Kātyāyana and Patañjali discuss both possibilities13: 
one, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, and the other, that it continues up to the end 
of 6.4. We will study this later in this chapter.  
From what both the Kāśikā and the Siddhāntakaumudī say about 6.4.22, the traditional 
interpretation of this rule can be rewritten as follows: 
A is suspended with respect to B if: 
(i) both A and B are taught in 6.4.22 – 6.4.175, and 
 
(ii) both A and B have a samānāśraya  
Note that the tradition does not make any actual distinction between asiddha and asiddhavat, 
which is why I have translated both terms as ‘suspended’. 
  
 
9 See Vt. 2 atragrahaṇam viṣayārtham (Mbh III.187.11) and Patañjali’s commentary on it. 
10 For example, consider the form rāga ‘colour’ which is derived from the root rañjI ‘to colour’. The 
derivation proceeds as follows: rañj + GHaÑ (3.3.18 bhāve)  raj + a (6.4.27 ghañi ca 
bhāvakaraṇayoḥ)  rāj + a (7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ)  rāga (7.3.52 cajoḥ ku ghiṇṇyatoḥ). Here, if 
6.4.27 is asiddhavat with respect to 7.2.116, then 7.2.116 will not apply after the application of 6.4.27. 
11 On vt. 2, Patañjali says: viṣayaḥ pratinirdiśyate. atraitasminn ābhāc chāstra ā bhāc chāstram 
asiddhaṁ yathā syāt. iha mā bhūt. abhāji rāgaḥ upabarhaṇam iti.  
12 yad ita ūrdhvam anukramiṣyāmaḥ ā adhyāyaparisamāpteḥ tad asiddhavat bhavati ity evaṁ 
veditavyam (Kāśikā on 6.4.22). 
13 Mbh III.192.10-193.19. 

173 
 
5.2 My Interpretation of These Three Rules 
In this section, I will present my interpretation of the three rules and support the same with 
evidence and examples. I will also show how SOI and DOI function in these sections.  
Let us first examine 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ and 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham respectively. I 
think that asiddha in these two rules denotes śāstrāsiddhi: rule X is asiddha with respect to 
rule Y. However, when rule X (śāstra) is asiddha with respect to rule Y, the outcome of the 
application of rule X (kārya) too will automatically be asiddha with respect to rule Y. In other 
words, I think that śāstrāsiddhi always entails kāryāsiddhi. Thus, we conclude that 6.1.86 and 
8.2.1 teach śāstrāsiddhi, and therefore, also teach kāryāsiddhi.14  
What impact does the fact that one rule is asiddha with respect to the other rule have on 1.4.2? 
We cannot use 1.4.2 to resolve a case of DOI unless both rules involved in the DOI 
acknowledge each other’s existence. How do we resolve cases of DOI where one rule does not 
acknowledge the existence of the other? In such cases of DOI, the rule which does not 
acknowledge the existence of the other rule prevails. This will become clearer through the 
examples discussed later in this chapter.  
Consider the following examples: 
 
1) adhī + Ktvā – ‘to study’, absolutive  
Note that adhī is formed by applying rule 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ (which teaches that a 
long vowel replaces both aK ‘a, i, u, r̥  or l̥’ and the immediately following savarṇa 
‘homogeneous’ vowel) to adhi + i. I have explained why we need to begin the derivation with 
adhī + Ktvā when discussing example 5 of section 4.3, chapter 4. 
To adhī + Ktvā, we apply the rule 7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap which teaches that, in a 
compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the affix Ktvā in the second part of the 
compound is replaced with LyaP. Thus, we get adhīya. 6.1.86 teaches that a rule prescribing a 
single replacement in place of the preceding and the following sound segments is asiddha with 
respect to rules teaching replacement with ṣ or attachment of augment tUK. Thus, we deem 
both 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ and the outcome of its application (because, remember, 
 
14 The Nyāsa on 8.2.1 too says so: śāstrasyāsiddhau ca kr̥ tāyām arthataḥ kāryāsiddhatvaṁ kr̥ tam eva 
bhavati tasya tannibandhanatvāt.  

174 
 
śāstrāsiddhi always entails kāryāsiddhi) to be suspended with respect to the rule 6.1.71 
hrasvasya piti kr̥ ti tuk, which teaches that augment tUK is attached to a verbal base ending in 
a short vowel when a kr̥ t affix marked with P follows. Therefore, we consider adhīya to be 
adhi-i-ya, apply 6.1.71 to it, and get the correct form adhītya. 
If Pāṇini had not taught 6.1.86, 6.1.71 would not have applied here, leading to the incorrect 
form *adhīya.15  
 
2) kas + asiñcat ‘Who sprinkled?’ 
The derivation proceeds as follows:  kas + asiñcat  kar + asiñcat (8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ16) 
 ka-u + asiñcat (6.1.113 ato ror aplutād aplute17)   ko asiñcat (6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ)  
ko’siñcat (6.1.109 eṅaḥ padāntād ati), which is the correct phrase. 
We have derived ko’siñcat by applying 6.1.109 eṅaḥ padāntād ati which teaches pūrvarūpa 
ekādeśa, i.e., the replacement of o + a in ko + asiñcat with the LHS sound o. By 6.1.86 
ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ, 6.1.109 and the outcome of its application (o) are asiddha with respect to 
the following rule teaching ṣatva: 
8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ: ṣ replaces non-pada-final s of a substitute or of an affix occurring after 
iṆ (any vowel except a; h, y, v, r and l) or a velar stop, even when there is intervention of nUM, 
visarjanīya, or śaR (ś, ṣ, s). 
 
15 Note that, if we had started the derivation with adhi + itvā, the derivation would have proceeded as 
follows. Two rules are applicable here, namely 6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ and 7.1.37 
samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap. This is a case of DOI. By 1.4.2, the RHS rule wins and we get adhi + iya. 
Here, two rules are applicable: 6.1.101 and 6.1.71 hrasvasya piti kr̥ ti tuk. This is a case of SOI. 6.1.71 
is more specific and thus wins. This gives us adhi + itya. Now 6.1.101 applies, giving the correct form 
adhītya. Notice that, if we start the derivation with adhi + itvā, we get the correct form without applying 
6.1.86. But the fact that Pāṇini composed 6.1.86 confirms the fact that the derivation of this compound 
begins with adhī + tvā and not with adhi + itvā, even though the compound itself is being formed from 
adhi and itvā by 2.2.18 kugatiprādayaḥ. I have discussed this in some detail in example 5 of section 
4.3, chapter 4. 
16 The s at the end of a pada and the final s of sajus ‘companion, together with’ are replaced with rU. 
17 An uT replaces a rU when it is both preceded and followed by a non-pluta a. 

175 
 
Thus 8.3.59 is not able to apply to ko’siñcat. If Pāṇini had not composed 6.1.86, then 8.3.59 
would have applied to ko’siñcat, giving us the incorrect form: *ko’ṣiñcat.  
However, there is a problematic aspect of this derivation that merits discussion: we know that 
8.2.66 sasajuṣoḥ ruḥ is asiddha with respect to 6.1.113 ato ror aplutād aplute by 8.2.1 
pūrvatrāsiddham. Therefore, 6.1.113 cannot acknowledge 8.2.66 and the outcome of its 
application and consequently cannot apply there. But this contradicts what we observe in the 
derivation of ko’siñcat where, in order to get the correct final form, we ought to apply 6.1.113 
to kar + asiñcat which is the direct outcome of the application of 8.2.66. 
Nyāsa on 6.1.113 acknowledges this problem but is unable to solve it. It says: the only rU that 
we find in the Aṣṭādhyāyī results from the application of 8.2.66. So Pāṇini would not have 
composed 6.1.113 which applies to rU if he intended for the outcome of the application of 
8.2.66 (i.e., rU) to be asiddha with respect to 6.1.113.18 Buiskool (1939: 101) thinks that Pāṇini 
has placed 6.1.113 in 6.1 only because of its similarity with the rules that precede and follow 
it.  
Here is a possible solution to this problem: I think that, in the Pāṇinian system, all possible 
rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the word enters 
a sentence. Let us call them word-level rules. Let us call those rules which apply after the word 
enters the sentence, sentence-level rules. I think Pāṇini does not consider word-level rules to 
be asiddha with respect to sentence-level rules. 8.2.66 is a word-level rule simply because it 
can be applied before the word enters the sentence, and thus is not asiddha with respect to 
6.1.113, which by virtue of applying at the boundary between two words is a sentence-level 
rule.19 
We do not find any examples of SOI or DOI involving 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ.  Let us now 
look at some derivations involving 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham, and also how this rule interacts with 
SOI and DOI.  
 
 
18 Yadi rutvam asiddhaṁ syāt tadā sthānitvena ror āśrayaṇam anarthakaṁ syāt. kasyacid 
ukārānubandhaviśiṣṭasya ror asambhavāt.  
19 However, I must admit that there exist other cases of this kind which remain intractable or 
unexplainable. For example, see example 15 of section 4.3, chapter 4 where 6.1.101 applies after the 
application of 8.2.28.  

176 
 
3) rājan + bhis – ‘king’, instrumental plural 
Here, we apply 8.2.7 nalopaḥ prātipadikāntasya (which teaches that the final n of a nominal 
stem termed pada is replaced with LOPA) and get rāja + bhis. By 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham20, 
rules like 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais21, 7.3.102 supi ca22 and 7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et23 which are 
applicable when deriving the instrumental plural of a-final stems, do not acknowledge the 
existence of 8.2.7. Consequently, they cannot acknowledge the outcome of its application 
either. Therefore, they are not applicable here. The correct form is rājabhiḥ.  
If Pāṇini had not taught 8.2.1, we would have got the incorrect form *rājaiḥ (cf. 7.1.9 ato bhisa 
ais). 
 
4) asmai + uddhara ‘lift (it) for him’  
The derivation proceeds as follows: asmai + uddhara  asmāy + uddhara (6.1.78 
eco’yavāyāvaḥ24)  asmā + uddhara (8.3.19 lopaḥ śākalyasya25). By 8.2.1, 8.3.19 is asiddha 
with respect to 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, which teaches that guṇa (a, e, o) replaces both a and the vowel 
immediately following it. Thus, the outcome of the application of 8.3.19 (i.e., asmā + uddhara) 
too is asiddha with respect to 6.1.87. Therefore, 6.1.87 is not applicable here. The correct 
phrase is asmā uddhara. 
 
20 Technically, there is a rule more specific than 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham which teaches this asiddhatva. 
This rule is 8.2.2 nalopaḥ supsvarasaṁjñātugvidhiṣu kr̥ ti, which teaches that the rule teaching n-
deletion is suspended with respect to rules pertaining to declension (suP), accent (svara), technical 
designations (saṁjñā) and introduction of augment tUK before a kr̥ t affix. 8.2.2 is a niyama sūtra, which 
allows n-deletion to be asiddha only in the aforementioned circumstances.  
21 Ais replaces bhis when bhis occurs after an a-final base. 
22 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when followed by a 
declensional affix starting with yaÑ (i.e., y, v, r l, jh, bh or any nasal). 
23 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e when followed by a plural declensional affix 
starting with jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative).  
24 An eC (e, o, ai, au) is replaced with ay, av, āy, āv respectively, when a vowel follows. 
25 A pada-final v or y which occurs after a or ā is, in the opinion of Śākalya, replaced with LOPA when 
aŚ (any voiced sound) follows. 

177 
 
If Pāṇini had not taught 8.2.1, we would have got the incorrect phrase *asmoddhara (cf. 6.1.87 
ād guṇaḥ). 
Derivations 3 and 4 involve 8.2.1 but do not involve any cases of DOI or SOI. Now let us look 
at examples 5 and 6 which, alongside 8.2.1, also involve cases of DOI and SOI respectively. 
 
5) bhujO + Kta – ‘to bend’, past passive participle 
                                                          bhu          j          +          ta 
 
                                                                       8.2.30             8.2.45 
8.2.30 coḥ kuḥ: a sound denoted by cU (palatals) is replaced with a corresponding sound 
denoted by kU (velars) when cU occurs at the end of a pada or is followed by jhaL (a non-
nasal stop or a fricative). 
8.2.45 oditaś ca: the t of a niṣṭhā affix26 which occurs after a verbal root marked with O is 
replaced with n. 
This is a case of DOI. Both rules lie in the tripādī. Thus, 8.2.30 does not acknowledge the 
existence of 8.2.45. As stated before, I think that 1.4.2 comes into play only if the two rules 
can acknowledge each other’s existence. Thus, 1.4.2 cannot address this case of DOI. 
Therefore, the rule that cannot see the other rule applies here, and we get: bhug + ta (8.2.30). 
Now, 8.2.45 applies and we get the correct form bhugna. 
In order to understand the crucial role played by 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham in this derivation, let 
us analyse how this derivation would have proceeded in its absence: 
                                                          bhu          j          +          ta 
 
                     8.2.30             8.2.45 
8.2.30 coḥ kuḥ: same as above. 
8.2.45 oditaś ca: same as above. 
 
26 1.1.26 ktaktavatū niṣṭhā. 

178 
 
This is a case of DOI. But before we look at the outcome (as per my interpretation of 1.4.2), 
let us understand the relationship between 8.2.30 and 8.2.45. If we apply 8.2.30 at this step, 
8.2.45 will be applicable at the following step (as seen in the derivation of bhugna above). But 
if we apply 8.2.45 at this step, then t will be replaced with n, which does not belong to jhaL. 
Thus 8.2.30 will not be applicable at the following step. In other words, the RHS rule 8.2.45 
blocks the LHS rule 8.2.30, but the LHS rule 8.2.30 does not block the RHS rule 8.2.45. This 
is a case of unidirectional blocking. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule 8.2.45 applies and we get bhuj + na. As stated 
above, 8.2.45 blocks 8.2.30. Thus, 8.2.30 is unable to apply to bhuj + na, and we get the 
incorrect form bhujna  *bhujña (8.4.40 stoś ścunā ścuḥ). 
To get the correct form, one needs to apply both rules, 8.2.30 and 8.2.45, in two consecutive 
steps. Since 8.2.45 unidirectionally blocks 8.2.30, the only way to apply both rules, is to apply 
them in the following order: first, 8.2.30, and then, 8.2.45. For this, one needs to devise a way 
to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2. Pāṇini has achieved this with the help of 8.2.1. He has placed 
8.2.45 (the RHS rule) after 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham and also after the LHS rule 8.2.30 in the 
serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. This enables 8.2.30 to ignore 8.2.45 and consequently, to apply 
before the application of 8.2.45.  
Let me state in general terms how Pāṇini uses 8.2.1 to impact certain cases of DOI. In those 
cases of DOI wherein the RHS rule unidirectionally blocks the LHS rule, and where Pāṇini 
wants both the RHS and LHS rules to apply, he places the RHS rule after 8.2.1 and after the 
LHS rule in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. In simple words, when required, Pāṇini uses 
8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 on those cases of DOI which involve 
unidirectional blocking, where it is desirable for him to do so.27  
 
 
 
27 Even though the traditional understanding of vipratiṣedha is different from mine, it must be 
mentioned here that, in his first vārttika on 8.2.1, Kātyāyana says: pūrvatrāsiddhe nāsti 
vipratiṣedho’bhāvād uttarasya “in the section headed by 8.2.1, vipratiṣedha does not arise because of 
the absence [i.e., suspension] of the rule which comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order” (Mbh 
III.385.14). 

179 
 
6) dah + tumUN – ‘to burn’, infinitive 
 
da         h         +           tum 
 
 
                                                   8.2.31              8.2.32 
8.2.31 ho ḍhaḥ: h is replaced with ḍh when h occurs at the end of a pada, or when it is followed 
by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 
8.2.32 dāder dhātor ghaḥ: gh replaces the final h of a verbal root beginning with d when it 
occurs at the end of a pada or is followed by jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative).  
Because 8.2.32 is in the section governed by 8.2.1 and follows 8.2.31 in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, it is asiddha with respect to 8.2.31. According to the tradition, since 8.2.32 is 
asiddha with respect to 8.2.31, 8.2.31 should apply here. This, however, gives daḍh + tum, 
which leads to the wrong form *dāḍhum.28  
Kātyāyana acknowledges the fact that, to get the correct answer, we need to apply 8.2.32 which 
is the exception, and not 8.2.31, which is the general rule. However, he assumes that the 
exception rule cannot win if it is asiddha with respect to the general rule. To tackle this 
problem, in vt. 229 on 8.2.1, he says: apavādo vacanaprāmāṇyāt ‘the exception [wins] on the 
authority of the statement [of rule 8.2.32]’. 
Thus, for the tradition, the exception rule 8.2.32 is not asiddha with respect to the general rule 
8.2.31, thanks to Kātyāyana’s vārttika. Therefore, the former wins, leading to the correct form: 
dah + tum  dagh + tum (8.2.32 dāder dhātor ghaḥ)   dagh + dhum (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor 
dho’dhaḥ)  dagdhum (8.4.53 jhalāṁ jaś jhaśi). 
I disagree with the tradition. I think that, in case of SOI, the more specific rule wins even if it 
is asiddha with respect to the general rule. Let me explain why. We know that Pāṇini has 
instructed us on how to tackle DOI through his rule 1.4.2, but he has not given any instructions 
about dealing with SOI. Similarly, I think that, in teaching 8.2.1 pūrvatrāsiddham and 6.4.22 
 
28 dah + tum  daḍh + tum (8.2.31)  daḍh + dhum (8.2.40 jhaṣas tathor dho’dhaḥ)  daḍh + ḍhum

asiddhavad atrā bhāt, Pāṇini has given instructions vis-à-vis DOI but not vis-à-vis SOI. In 
other words, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 have no impact on SOI. Consider the following situation:  
K                              +                        L 
 
                           R1K                       R2K                       R1L                         R2L     
We know that there is an SOI between R1K and R2K, and an SOI between R1L and R2L. Before 
1.4.2, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 can potentially exert their influence, Pāṇini resolves both these SOIs. 
Let us assume that R1K is more specific that R2K, thus R1K wins. Similarly, let us assume that 
R1L is more specific than R2L, thus R1L wins. The above diagram can be redrawn as follows, 
by omitting to mention the losing rules: 
K                              +                        L 
 
                                           R1K                                                    R1L       
Now, 1.4.2, 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 can potentially come into play. If neither of the two rules are 
governed by 8.2.1 or 6.4.22, then by my interpretation of 1.4.2, the RHS rule R1L applies at 
this step. If 8.2.1 governs one of the two rules, that is, for example, if R1L is asiddha with 
respect to R1K, then 1.4.2, which I think comes into the picture only when both rules 
acknowledge each other’s existence, cannot resolve this DOI. By 8.2.1, R1K applies at this step. 
I hope this disambiguates my proposition that 1.4.2, 8.2.1 etc. are relevant in regard with DOI 
but not in regard with SOI.                        
Coming back to the present example, I think the fact that 8.2.32 is asiddha with respect to 
8.2.31 has no bearing on our method of resolving SOI, which requires us to pick the more 
specific rule. The more specific rule 8.2.32 wins despite being asiddha with respect to the 
general rule 8.2.31. 
Now let us examine 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter, 
according to the Kāśikā, 6.4.22 means: 
A is asiddhavat with respect to B if: 
(i) both A and B are taught in 6.4.22 – 6.4.175 (ā bhāt), and 
(ii) both A and B have a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’ (atra). 

181 
 
I disagree with Kāśikā’s interpretation of all three parts of this rule, namely asiddhavat, ā bhāt 
and atra. Let us begin by looking at asiddhavat. As stated in section 5.1, the tradition does not 
differentiate between asiddha and asiddhavat. It interprets both of them as ‘suspended’. 
However, I do not think that Pāṇini would have added -vat to asiddha if he wanted to convey 
a meaning that can be conveyed by asiddha itself.  
In fact, asiddhavat is derived by adding the taddhita affix vatI to asiddha + Ṭā (cf. 5.1.115 
tena tulyaṁ kriyā cedvatiḥ30). Ṭā is later deleted by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, thereby 
leading to the form asiddhavat, which means ‘like asiddha’. So, asiddhavat is different from 
yet similar to asiddha. 
We know that asiddha implies śāstrāsiddhi (‘Rule X is suspended with respect to rule Y’) 
which in turn always entails kāryāsiddhi (‘The outcome of the application of rule X is 
suspended with respect to rule Y’). Because asiddha and asiddhavat have different meanings, 
the only possible interpretation of asiddhavat is kāryāsiddhi: ‘the outcome of the application 
of rule X is suspended with respect to rule Y.’31 I will support this conclusion with more 
evidence later in this chapter. The meanings of asiddha and asiddhavat can be summarized as 
follows: 
Type 
śāstrāsiddhi 
kāryāsiddhi 
asiddha 
Yes 
Yes 
asiddhavat 
No 
Yes 
 
 
 
 
30 The taddhita affix vatI occurs to denote the sense of tulya ‘similar to, comparable with’ after a 
syntactically related nominal stem ending in tr̥ tīyā ‘instrumental’, provided what is tulya is also kriyā 
‘action’. 
31 Cardona (1997: 425) too holds this opinion: “I differ from Pāṇinīyas in my interpretation of 6.4.22 
[asiddhavad atrābhāt]. Pāṇinīyas maintain that this too should be considered to provide for rule 
suspension (śāstrāsiddhatvam), not the suspension of what results from applying rules 
(kāryāsiddhatvam)”.  
 

182 
 
So, how does 6.4.22, which teaches asiddhavat, interact with 1.4.2?  
(i) In case of DOI between two rules, if these two rules are asiddhavat with respect to each 
other, they acknowledge each other’s existence (because there is no śāstrāsiddhi). This allows 
the resolution of the DOI by 1.4.2.  
(ii) Each of these two rules involved in DOI does not acknowledge the outcome of the 
application of the other (because there is kāryāsiddhi).  This ensures that, after the RHS rule 
has applied (by my interpretation of 1.4.2), the LHS rule always applies at the following step, 
because it does not acknowledge the outcome of the application of the RHS rule.  
This will become clearer in the examples below. Now let us attempt to decipher the meaning 
of ā bhāt in 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter, Kātyāyana 
and Patañjali discuss both possibilities: one, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, and 
the other, that it continues up to the end of 6.4.  
I think that the adhikāra of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129. Let me explain why this is the case. We 
know how Pāṇini indicates the boundary of adhikāra sūtras: he uses either ā or prāk in 
conjunction with a term from the sūtra which constitutes the boundary, in the ablative. For 
example, consider 1.4.1 ā kaḍārād ekā saṁjñā , the jurisdiction of which ends at 2.2.38 kaḍārāḥ 
karmadhāraye and 4.1.83 prāg dīvyato’ṇ, the jurisdiction of which ends at 4.4.2 tena dīvyati 
khanati jayati jitam. So, if Pāṇini wanted to state that the adhikāra of 6.4.22 continues up to 
6.4.175 r̥ tvyavāstvyavāstvamādhvīhiraṇyayāni cchandasi, then he would have said, in 6.4.22, 
asiddhavad atra ā r̥ tvyāt (which, after sandhi, becomes asiddhavad atrārtvyāt). But since he 
has said asiddhavad atrābhāt, the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 continues only up to 6.4.129 bhasya. 
The examples discussed below will buttress my position. 
Now let us examine the word atra in 6.4.22. As stated in section 5.1 of this chapter, Kātyāyana 
discusses two possible interpretations of the word atra. One is samānāśrayatva ‘common 
substratum’ and the other ‘with respect to the rules taught here’. Only one of the two 
interpretations can be correct, and I think that it is the latter, for reasons that I will now explain.   
Firstly, notice that in 8.2.1 we find another term which like a-tra, ends in the affix traL, namely 
pūrva-tra. There, pūrva-tra means ‘with respect to the rules taught before (in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s 
serial order)’. This strongly suggests that in 6.4.22, atra, which also ends in tra, means ‘with 
respect to the rules taught here (in the section governed by 6.4.22)’.  

183 
 
Secondly, consider Kāśikā’s interpretation of 6.4.22:  that which is taught in the section starting 
here and extending up to the end of 6.4 (ā bhāt) is suspended (asiddhavat), if both rules have 
a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’ (atra). It infers samānāśrayatva from the word atra. But 
if we assume that atra implies samānāśrayatva, then it follows that Pāṇini has not said anything 
about the rules with respect to which the rules in the section headed by 6.4.22 are asiddhavat. 
As I have stated earlier, in such a case, rules in the ābhīya section become asiddhavat with 
respect to, for example, rules from adhyāya seven, which is not desirable. This too indicates 
that atra means ‘with respect to the rules taught here (i.e., in the section 6.4.22-6.4.129)’. I will 
discuss this further when dealing with specific examples below.  
Now that I have discussed my opinion about all three parts of 6.4.22, namely asiddhavat, atra 
and ā bhāt, here is my interpretation of 6.4.22: 
6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt: the outcome of the application of a rule taught in the section 
6.4.22-6.4.129, is not acknowledged by any other rule taught here (atra), that is, in the section 
6.4.22-6.4.129. 
For the sake of clarity, I reproduce the table dealing with the difference between asiddha and 
asiddhavat below: 
Type 
śāstrāsiddhi 
kāryāsiddhi 
asiddha 
Yes 
Yes 
asiddhavat 
No 
Yes 
 
Before we look at derivations involving 6.4.22, here is a summary of my interpretation of all 
three rules: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

184 
 
 
Let us now look at derivations which involve both SOI and 6.4.22.  
7) han + siP – ‘to hurt’, imperative second-person singular32 
han      +       siP 
 
                                                                   3.1.68    3.4.87  
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not 
marked with P. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get han 
+ hi. Thereafter the derivation proceeds as follows: han + hi  han + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68)  
 
32 We have performed an almost identical derivation in chapter 4 (see derivation 10, section 4.3). There, 
we replaced hi with tātAṄ, by the optional rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. Here, however, 
we will not apply 7.1.35.

185 
 
han + hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ). Now, han can be called an aṅga with respect to hi 
(cf. my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become 
applicable: 
han      +      hi 
 
                                                  6.4.36         6.4.37       
6.4.36 hanter jaḥ: the root han is replaced with ja when the affix hi follows. 
6.4.37 anudāttopadeśavanatitanotyādīnām anunāsikalopo jhali kṅiti: the final nasal of a base 
marked with anudātta when taught in the Dhātupāṭha, as well as of vanA ‘to like’ and the roots 
headed by tanU ‘to extend’, is replaced with LOPA when an affix beginning with jhaL (a non-
nasal stop or a fricative) and marked with K or Ṅ follows.33 
There is an SOI relationship between 6.4.36 and 6.4.37.  6.4.36 is specifically taught for han + 
hi, so it is more specific than 6.4.37.  
Note that the two rules 6.4.36 and 6.4.37 have been taught in the asiddhavat section. However, 
as argued above (see example 6), Pāṇini’s rules 8.2.1 and 6.4.22 deal with DOI, but not with 
SOI. Like 8.2.1, 6.4.22 too has no impact on SOI. Here, the more specific rule 6.4.36 wins, and 
we get jahi, which is the correct form. 
Now let us imagine what would have happened in the absence of 6.4.22. The following rule 
would have become applicable to ja + hi: 
6.4.105 ato heḥ: a hi which comes after a base ending in a is replaced with LUK.  
This would have given the incorrect form *ja. 6.4.22 helps us avoid deriving this incorrect 
form: as taught by 6.4.22, 6.4.36 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.105. So even though 6.4.105 
can acknowledge the existence of 6.4.36, it cannot acknowledge the outcome of the application 
of 6.4.36. As a result, 6.4.105 is not applicable to jahi.  
 
 
 
33 Since hi is a sārvadhātuka which is not marked with P, we can say that it is marked with K by 1.2.4 
sārvadhātukam apit. Thus 6.4.37 is applicable.  

186 
 
8) bhū + tas – ‘to be’, perfect third-person dual 
bhū                   +                 tas 
 
                                                  6.1.8                                  3.4.82 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: a verbal base which has not undergone reduplication undergoes 
reduplication when followed by LIṬ.34  
3.4.82 parasmaipadānāṁ ṇalatususthalathusaṇalvamāḥ: ṆaL, atus, us, thaL, athus, a, ṆaL, va 
and ma respectively come in place of the nine parasmaipada replacements of LIṬ namely tiP, 
tas, jhi, siP, thas, tha, miP, vas and mas. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.82 and get: bhū + atus. Here, three 
rules are applicable: 
  bhū                   +                 atus 
 
                               6.4.77          6.1.8         6.4.88               
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau: the final i and u of Śnu, and of any verbal base, 
and of bhrū ‘brow’ are replaced with iyAṄ and uvAṄ, respectively, when an affix beginning 
with a vowel follows. 
6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ: augment vUK is attached to bhū when a LUṄ or LIṬ affix beginning 
with a vowel follows. 
This is a case of SOI. Note that 6.4.77 and 6.4.88 both belong to the section headed by 6.4.22. 
However, as stated above, 6.4.22 does not impact SOI. Let us find out which of the three rules 
is the most specific. 
6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau 
bhū + affix beginning with aC 
other conditions 
 
34 Note that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 
ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

187 
 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya 
bhū + affix beginning with aC (LIṬ) 
other conditions 
6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ 
bhū + affix beginning with aC (LIṬ) 
bhū + affix beginning with aC (LUṄ) 
other conditions 
6.4.88 and 6.1.8 are both more specific than 6.4.77 because 6.4.77 has not been taught 
specifically for LIṬ. Between 6.4.88 and 6.1.8, 6.1.8 is more specific because it has been taught 
exclusively for LIṬ, whereas 6.4.88 has been taught for both LUṄ and LIṬ. 
Thus, 6.1.8 emerges as the most specific rule. Upon applying it, we get: bhūbhū + atus. Here 
the following rules are applicable: 
bh               ū               bh             ū         +         atus 
  
                                                7.4.73          6.4.88                   6.4.77 
7.4.73 bhavater aḥ: a replaces the last sound of the abhyāsa of bhū ‘to be’ when LIṬ follows. 
6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ: same as above. 
6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ yvor iyaṅuvaṅau: same as above. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we perform the RHS operation. But which of the two RHS rules 
should we apply? As stated above, there is an SOI between 6.4.88 and 6.4.77, and the more 
specific rule 6.4.88 wins. Thus, we get: bhūbhūv + atus. At this step, 7.4.43 applies, giving us 
bhabhūv + atus. Now that all rules from the sapādasaptādhyāyī have applied, the rule 8.4.54 
abhyāse car ca applies, thereby giving the correct form: babhūvatuḥ.  
In vt. 1435 on 6.4.22, Kātyāyana alludes to the interaction between vUK (6.4.88) and uvAṄ 
(6.4.77). He says: vugyuṭāv uvaṅyaṇoḥ ‘rules teaching augments vUK and yUṬ [should be 
siddha and not asiddhavat] with respect to rules teaching uvAṄ and yaṆ’. This vārttika is 
 
35 Mbh III.191.15.  

188 
 
premised on the assumption that, if 6.4.88 bhuvo vug luṅliṭoḥ is asiddhavat (which according 
to the tradition, has the same meaning as asiddha) with respect to 6.4.77 aci śnudhātubhruvāṁ 
yvor iyaṅuvaṅau, then 6.4.77 will apply, giving the wrong answer *babhuvatuḥ.  
However, as I have shown in the derivation above, there is an SOI between 6.4.77 and 6.4.88, 
and 6.4.22 has no impact on SOI. Thus, Pāṇini’s system correctly derives this form, and this 
vārttika is not required to assist in the process. 
Now let us consider an example which demonstrates the impact of 6.4.22 on DOI. 
 
9) śās + siP – ‘to teach’, imperative second-person singular36 
śās            +            siP 
 
                                                                       3.1.68      3.4.87 
3.1.68 kartari śap: affix ŚaP occurs after a verbal root when a sārvadhātuka affix which 
denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’ follows. 
3.4.87 ser hy apic ca: a siP replacement of LOṬ is replaced with hi and is treated as if not 
marked with P. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.4.87 and get śās 
+ hi. Thereafter, the derivation proceeds as follows: śās + hi  śās + ŚaP + hi (3.1.68)  śās 
+ hi (2.4.72 adiprabhr̥ tibhyaḥ śapaḥ37). śās can now be called an aṅga with respect to hi (cf. 
my interpretation of 1.4.13). Thus, the following rules from the aṅgādhikāra become 
applicable: 
śās                +               hi 
 
                                        6.4.34             6.4.35                  6.4.101             
 
36 We have performed this derivation in chapter 4. See derivation 9 of section 4.3. There, we replaced 
hi with tātAṄ, by the optional rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. Here, however, we will not 
do so. 
37 Affix ŚaP is replaced with LUK when it occurs after roots belonging to the set headed by adA ‘to eat’ 
(second class). 

189 
 
6.4.34 śāsa id aṅhaloḥ: the penultimate sound of śās, is replaced with short i when followed 
by aṄ, or an affix that begins with a consonant and is marked with K or Ṅ. 38 
6.4.35 śā hau: śās is replaced with śā when affix hi follows. 
6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her dhiḥ: hi is replaced with dhi when it occurs after root hu or after a form 
ending in jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative). 
There is an SOI between 6.4.34 and 6.4.35. As stated before, 6.4.22 does not impact SOI. 6.4.35 
is more specific because it pertains to hi alone and thus wins.  
Now we shall focus on the interaction between 6.4.35 and 6.4.101. Note that both these rules 
fall under the heading rule 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt. Thus 6.4.35 can acknowledge the 
existence of 6.4.101 but cannot acknowledge the outcome of the application of 6.4.101. 
Similarly, 6.4.101 can acknowledge the existence of 6.4.35 but not the outcome of the 
application of 6.4.35.  
Since 6.4.35 and 6.4.101 acknowledge each other’s existence, we can use 1.4.2 to deal with 
this case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.101 and get śās + 
dhi. Since 6.4.101 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.35, 6.4.35 does not acknowledge the 
outcome of the application of 6.4.101. Thus 6.4.35 applies and we get the correct form: śādhi. 
In order to understand the crucial role played by 6.4.22 in this derivation, let us analyse how 
this derivation would have proceeded in its absence. We will directly look at the relevant step: 
śās            +           hi 
 
                                                          6.4.35                  6.4.101 
Let us examine the relationship between 6.4.35 and 6.4.101. If, by 6.4.35, we replace śās with 
śā at this step, then 6.4.101, which applies to hi when hi is preceded by jhaL, will not be 
applicable at the following step. If, by 6.4.101, we replace hi with dhi at this step, then 6.4.35, 
which applies to śās when it is followed by hi, will not be applicable at the following step. This 
is a case of mutual blocking in DOI.  
 
38 hi is an apit (cf. 3.4.87 ser hy apic ca) sārvadhātuka, and so by 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam apit, we can say 
that it is marked with K or Ṅ. Thus, 6.4.34 is applicable here.  

190 
 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.101 and get śās + dhi. As stated 
above, 6.4.35 is not applicable after the application of 6.4.101. Thus, the final form is *śāsdhi, 
which is incorrect. To get the correct form śādhi, we need to apply both 6.4.35 and 6.4.101. 
However, since both rules block each other, only one can apply in this derivation. To overcome 
this problem, Pāṇini has put them both in the section headed by 6.4.22. 
6.4.22 teaches that the two rules within 6.4.22-6.4.129 are asiddhavat with respect to each 
other. At the risk of repetition, let me state that this ensures two things: 
(i) Both rules acknowledge each other’s existence. This allows the resolution of the DOI by 
(my interpretation of) 1.4.2.  
(ii) Each of the two rules does not acknowledge the outcome of the application of the other.  
This ensures that, after the RHS rule has applied (by my interpretation of 1.4.2), the LHS rule 
applies at the following step, because it does not acknowledge the outcome of the application 
of the RHS rule.  
Let me state in general terms what we have seen in this derivation. In those cases of DOI 
wherein two rules block each other, and where Pāṇini wants both rules to apply, he places them 
in the section 6.4.22-6.4.129. In simple words, when required, Pāṇini uses 6.4.22 asiddhavad 
atrā bhāt to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 (as interpreted by me) on those cases of DOI which 
involve mutual blocking, where it is desirable for him to do so. Contrast this with 8.2.1, which 
as I have stated earlier, is leveraged by Pāṇini to neutralize the impact of 1.4.2 on those cases 
of DOI which involve unidirectional blocking.39  
Note that, if Pāṇini had taught 6.4.22 as asiddham atrā bhāt instead of asiddhavad atrā bhāt, 
then both rules, namely 6.4.35 and 6.4.101, would not be able to acknowledge each other. Thus, 
both would try to apply to their respective operands. Since only one rule can apply at any given 
step, the machine would have come to a halt.   
Now, through the following derivation, I will provide evidence to support my claim that the 
jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129.

10) Let us derive the accusative plural of the Vedic perfect participle of pā ‘to drink’: pā + LIṬ 
‘he who had drunk’40. 
                                                       pā            +          LIṬ

3.2.107 kvasuś ca: KvasU optionally replaces LIṬ in Vedic when the action is denoted in the 
past. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 3.2.107 and get pā + KvasU. Here the 
following rules are applicable: 
                                                           pā      +       vas

4.1.2 svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup42 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 4.1.2 and get: pā + vas + Śas. Here, the 
following rules are applicable: 
 
pā           +         vas           +          Śas 
 
                                          6.1.8                   6.4.131  
 
 
40 In contrast with other derivations, where, for brevity’s sake, I start the derivation directly with the 
substitute of the lakāra, here I have started this unconventional derivation with LIṬ for the sake of 
clarity. 
41 Note that the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 
ekāco dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 
42 This is applicable because KvasU is a kr̥ t affix (cf. 1.2.46 kr̥ ttaddhitasamāsāś ca).

6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam: the semivowel of the affix vasU in an item termed bha is 
replaced with the corresponding vowel u. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.131 and get pā + uas + Śas. Here, 
the following rules are applicable: 
pā                 +               uas              +                Śas 
 
               6.4.64                     6.1.8                6.1.108 
6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca: the final ā of a base is replaced with LOPA when followed by augment 
iṬ or an ārdhadhātuka affix which begins with a vowel and is marked with K or Ṅ. 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
6.1.108 samprasāraṇāc ca: a samprasāraṇa vowel and the following vowel, are together 
replaced with the former. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS 6.1.108 rule and get pā + us + Śas. Here, two 
rules are applicable: 
pā                 +               us              +                Śas 
 
               6.1.8                      6.4.64                 
6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca: same as above. 
6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya: same as above. 
This is a case of SOI. Let us compare the two rules to determine which one is more specific: 
6.4.64  
ā + affix beginning with vowel (ārdhadhātuka) (marked with K or Ṅ) 
other conditions 
6.1.8  
ā + affix beginning with vowel (LIṬ) 
other conditions 

193 
 
We cannot say that one rule is more specific than the other in this scenario. So, which of the 
two rules should we apply here?  
Let us understand the relationship between the two rules. 
In pā + us + Śas, if we apply 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya, we get pāpā + us + Śas. 6.4.64 
āto lopa iṭi ca is still applicable here.  
But in pā + us + Śas, if we apply 6.4.64 (which teaches the substitution of ā with ø i.e., LOPA), 
we get pø + us + Śas. Here, is 6.1.8 applicable?  
Pāṇini has taught the rule 1.1.59 dvirvacane’ci, which, according to the Kāśikā43, teaches that 
the substitute of a vowel is treated like its substituendum (i.e., the said vowel) – for the purpose 
of reduplication alone – when it is followed by a vowel-initial affix which conditions 
reduplication of the verbal base. So, in pø + us + Śas, by 1.1.59, we can treat LOPA (ø), which 
is the substitute of vowel ā, as the substituendum ā, because it is followed by the vowel-initial 
affix us which causes reduplication. Therefore, 6.1.8 liṭi dhātor anabhyāsasya is applicable 
here. 
We have seen that the two rules do not block each other and we can apply them in any order. I 
think Pāṇini composed 1.1.59 to ensure that, if we apply 6.4.64 to pā + us + Śas, 6.1.8 can still 
be applied at the following step.  
After applying both 6.4.64 and 6.1.8, we get pāp + us + Śas. To this we apply 7.4.59 hrasvaḥ44 
and get the correct form: papuṣaḥ.45 
As stated before, according to my interpretation of 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrā bhāt, the jurisdiction 
of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129.  
However, in the opinion of the Kāśikā, this jurisdiction continues up to the end of 6.4 (i.e., 
6.4.175) and, therefore, it creates a difficulty in the derivation of papuṣaḥ. As seen above, 
6.4.131 vasoḥ samprasāraṇam changes vas to uas. Since uas begins with a vowel, 6.4.64 āto 
 
43 Note that the Mahābhāṣya discusses two possible interpretations of 1.1.59. I have mentioned the one 
accepted by the Kāśikā. I think this is the correct interpretation. The Kaumudī accepts the other 
interpretation, which I think is incorrect. I will not discuss the same here because it is not directly related 
to the topic of asiddhavat. 
44 The vowel of the abhyāsa ‘first of two reduplicated syllables’ is replaced with its short counterpart. 
45 8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ. 

194 
 
lopa iṭi ca becomes applicable to the ā of pā. However, both 6.4.64 and 6.4.131 lie within 
6.4.22 – 6.4.175, which is the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 according to the Kāśikā. Thus, the Kāśikā 
deems them asiddhavat with respect to each other. Consequently, 6.4.64 does not acknowledge 
the outcome of the application of 6.4.131. In other words, it does not acknowledge the change 
from vas to uas and cannot apply. This gives the incorrect form: papā + usas  *paposas 
(6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ). 
I think the tradition interprets atra as samānāśraya for the sole purpose of overcoming this 
problem. According to the Kāśikā, two rules can be called asiddhavat by 6.4.22 only if they 
have a samānāśraya ‘common substratum’. Without explaining exactly what this means, the 
Kāśikā gives the following example: 6.4.131 and 6.4.64 do not have a samānāśraya, and thus 
they are not asiddhavat with respect to each other.46 Consequently, 6.4.64 acknowledges 
6.4.131 and applies to papā + uṣaḥ (which has been derived by applying 6.4.131). In this way, 
we get the correct form papuṣaḥ.   
But what exactly does samānāśraya stand for? The Nyāsa glosses āśraya as nimitta ‘cause’. 
So according to the Nyāsa, a rule is asiddhavat with respect to another only if the two rules 
have a samānāśraya ‘common cause’. However, I do not think that here āśraya means nimitta. 
Let me explain why, by looking at another derivation: at the step śās + hi (see derivation 9 of 
this section), 6.4.35 śā hau which applies to śās is caused by hi, while 6.4.101 hujhalbhyo her 
dhiḥ, which applies to hi, is caused by śās. Even though the two rules do not have the same 
cause, the tradition deems them asiddhavat with respect to each other. So, when Kātyāyana 
uses the word samānāśraya in vt. 12 samānāśrayavacanāt siddham, he does not imply 
‘common cause’. What then does he mean? 
It is not possible to answer this question with certainty. But one can speculate that when 
Kātyāyana says two rules are samānāśraya, he likely means that they pertain to the same set 
of items. Both rules 6.4.101 and 6.4.35 pertain to śās + hi, thus they are samānāśraya and 
asiddhavat with respect to each other. However, in our present example, 6.4.131 pertains to 
vas + Śas, whereas 6.4.64 āto lopa iṭi ca pertains to papā + uas. The two rules have different 
āśrayas ‘substrata’ and thus, according to the tradition, they are not asiddhavat with respect to 
each other.  
 
46 On vt. 12 samānāśrayatvāt siddham, Patañjali says, samānāśrayam asiddhaṁ bhavati vyāśrayaṁ 
caitat.  

195 
 
Kātyāyana also offers another solution, which basically amounts to stating that this set of 
examples should be exempt from following 6.4.22. In vt. 947 on 6.4.22, he teaches: siddhaṁ 
vasusamprasāraṇam ajvidhau ‘the samprasāraṇa of vasU should be siddha (rather than 
asiddhavat) with regard to an operation concerning vowels.’  
It is evident that the tradition struggles to resolve this problem and comes up with not one, but 
two alternative ways of dealing with it. Not only does Kātyāyana write a vārttika contradicting 
6.4.22, but he also concocts the concept of samānāśrayatva to address this difficulty. 
On the contrary, notice that, according to my interpretation of 6.4.22, 6.4.131 does not lie in 
the ābhīya section (6.4.22-6.4.129). Thus, in my opinion, 6.4.131 is not asiddhavat with respect 
to 6.4.64. Therefore, if we accept that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 stops at 6.4.129, the challenges 
faced by the tradition in deriving this form do not rise. My interpretation of atra (with respect 
to the rules taught here, i.e., in the section headed by 6.4.22) and ā bhāt (up to 6.4.129) allows 
us to correctly derive papuṣaḥ without flouting 6.4.22. 
Kātyāyana also discusses other examples of this nature, wherein he has had to write ad hoc 
vārttikas claiming that certain rules taught in the section 6.4.129-6.4.175, which, according to 
him, constitute a part of the ābhīya section (6.4.22-6.4.175), are not asiddhavat, contrary to his 
own interpretation of 6.4.22 (generally adopted by the later tradition).  
For example, the problem faced by the tradition in deriving paśuṣaḥ (accusative plural of paśu 
+ saN ‘bestowing cattle’) is the same as the one faced in deriving papuṣaḥ. To avoid 
redundancy, I will derive it by my method here without showing the DOI and SOI that might 
arise at different steps: paśusaN + vIṬ (3.2.67 janasanakhanakramagamo viṭ)  paśusan + 
vIṬ + Śas (4.1.2 svaujas…)  paśusan + ø + Śas (6.1.67 ver apr̥ ktasya)  paśusaā + ø + Śas 
(6.4.41 viḍvanor anunāsikasyāt, 1.1.62 pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam)   paśusa + Śas 
(6.4.140 āto dhātoḥ)  paśusas (6.1.97 ato guṇe)  paśuṣaḥ (8.3.108 sanoter anaḥ).  
As seen in this derivation, in order to correctly derive paśuṣaḥ, one needs to first apply 6.4.41 
viḍvanor anunāsikasyāt and then 6.4.140 āto dhātoḥ. However, according to the tradition, since 
the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 continues up to 6.4.175, 6.4.41 is asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.140. 
Consequently 6.4.140 cannot apply after the application of 6.4.41. This creates an obstacle in 
correctly deriving paśuṣaḥ. To deal with this problem, Kātyāyana has composed vt. 1148 on 
 
47 Mbh III.190.11. 
48 Mbh III.190.17. 

196 
 
6.4.22, effectively negating 6.4.22: āttvaṁ yalopāllopayoḥ paśuṣo na vājān49 cākhāyitā 
cākhāyitum ‘āttva (here, taught by 6.4.41) should be siddha when y-deletion and ā-deletion 
(here, taught by 6.4.140) [can potentially take place e.g.,] paśuṣo na vājān, cākhāyitā [and] 
cākhāyitum.’ But if one thinks, as I do, that the jurisdiction of 6.4.22 ends at 6.4.129, then this 
problem simply does not arise. This is because 6.4.140 lies beyond 6.4.129, and therefore, in 
my view, 6.4.41 is not asiddhavat with respect to 6.4.140.50  
Now, I will derive a certain form, then highlight the problem faced by the tradition in this 
derivation vis-à-vis 6.4.22, and will show how, by following my method, we do not encounter 
this problem at all.

7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above. 
7.1.37 samāse’nañpūrve ktvo lyap: in a compound, the first member of which is not naÑ, the 
affix Ktvā in the second member of the compound is replaced with LyaP. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 7.1.37 and get: praśam + ṆiC + LyaP. 
Here the following rules are applicable: 
praś      a      m          +         ṆiC        +        LyaP 
 
                                            7.2.116                        6.4.56 
7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ: same as above.  
6.4.56 lyapi laghupūrvāt52: Ṇi, when occurring after a sound segment which is preceded by a 
laghu ‘light’ vowel, is replaced with ay, provided the ārdhadhātuka affix LyaP follows. 
By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.56 and get praśam + ay + LyaP. 
Here, 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ applies and we get praśām + ay + LyaP. At this stage, 6.4.92 
mitām hrasvaḥ applies, which teaches that the penultimate vowel of a base marked with M (in 
the Dhātupāṭha), is replaced with its short counterpart when affix Ṇi follows. But here, praśām 
is not followed by ṆiC but instead by ay. Then how can 6.4.92 apply? 6.4.92 considers 6.4.56 
to be asiddhavat, and thus cannot see the outcome of the latter’s application: it sees praśām + 
ay + LyaP as praśām + ṆiC + LyaP, and thus applies, giving us the correct form, praśamayya. 
Owing to a relevant vārttika (vt. 13 on 6.4.22) which we will discuss soon, it becomes clear 
that Kātyāyana, when trying to derive praśamayya, applies some of these rules in a different 
order: first, 7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ, second, 6.4.92 mitāṁ hrasvaḥ and third 6.4.56 lyapi 
 
52 “Lyapi laghupūrvāt originally was lyapi laghupūrvasya. The substitution of the Ablative for the 
Genitive case has been suggested by Kātyāyana (Vol. III. p. 204).” See Kielhorn (1887: 178-184) – 
reprinted in Staal’s ‘A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians’ (1972: 121). The original version, lyapi 
laghupūrvasya, teaches that ‘Ṇi, when preceded by a light vowel, is replaced with ay, provided the 
ārdhadhātuka affix LyaP follows.’ In praśam + ṆiC + LyaP, even though there is a light vowel (a of 
śam) to the left of Ṇi, note that Ṇi is not immediately preceded by a (there is m between a and Ṇi). To 
lend greater clarity to this rule, Kātyāyana decided to edit it (vt. 1: lyapi laghupūrvasyeti ced 
vyañjanānteṣūpasaṁkhyānam; vt. 3: lyapi laghupūrvād iti vacanāt siddham). Since we are discussing 
an example based on Kātyāyana’s vārttika 13 on 6.4.22 here, I have presented his version in the main 
text, rather than the original one.

laghupūrvāt. Let us apply these three rules as per Kātyāyana’s order to understand the problem 
faced by him: praśam + ṆiC + LyaP  praśām + ṆiC + LyaP (7.2.116 ata upadhāyāḥ)  
praśam + ṆiC + LyaP (6.4.92 mitāṁ hrasvaḥ)  praśamayya (6.4.56 lyapi laghupūrvāt).  
But applying rules in this order is against what Pāṇini has taught in 6.4.22. Let me explain how. 
6.4.56 is applicable to ṆiC when it is preceded by a sound (m of praśam) which is in turn 
preceded by a light vowel (the penultimate sound a of praśam). But the light vowel a is the 
outcome of the application of 6.4.92, which, as per 6.4.22, should be considered asiddhavat 
with respect to 6.4.56. So, in this derivation, if we are to follow 6.4.22, 6.4.56 should not apply 
after the application of 6.4.92.   
To ensure that the correct form praśamayya is derived, Kātyāyana formulates vt. 1353, which 
basically goes against 6.4.22: hrasvayalopāllopaś cāyādeśe lyapi ‘a short vowel (here, taught 
by 6.4.92), y-deletion and ā-deletion [should not be suspended] when ay-substitution before 
LyaP (here, taught by 6.4.56) [can take place]’. 
On the contrary, by following my interpretation of 1.4.2, we get the correct answer without 
violating 6.4.22. This provides further proof that my interpretation of 1.4.2 is indeed correct.  
In this chapter, I have discussed my opinion about the exact meanings of the three suspension 
rules, the difference between asiddha and asiddhavat, how these suspension rules impact SOI 
and DOI, how they interact with 1.4.2, and how my interpretations enable us to perform various 
kinds of derivations without having to rely on Kātyāyana’s vārttikas. I do not claim to have 
solved every problem associated with the three suspension rules, nor do I claim to have 
discussed each kind of example associated with these three rules. To the extent possible, I have 
attempted to display the diversity of derivational examples impacted by the suspension rules.  
Modern scholars, such as Bronkhorst (1980), Joshi (1982), Joshi and Roodbergen (1987), and 
Yagi (1992) have published papers on the three suspension rules. Some of their opinions are 
similar to mine, and others considerably different. However, in the interest of clarity, I have 
restricted the discussions in this chapter to a limited set of traditional opinions and my own 
opinion on this topic, without examining the opinions of modern scholars.

Chapter Six 
In this concluding chapter, I will discuss the thought process that might have led Pāṇini to 
construct his algorithm for dealing with Same Step Rule Interaction (henceforth SSRI), how 
this algorithm was interpreted by traditional and modern scholars, and finally how we can use 
the knowledge of the correct meaning of 1.4.2 to conduct further research in Pāṇinian studies 
and allied disciplines. In essence, I will examine the past, present and future of Pāṇinian 
studies, with a special focus on the role played by SSRI in the functioning of the Pāṇinian 
machine. Since the goal of this chapter is merely to summarize the timeline of Pāṇinian 
thought, I will keep my arguments brief and will focus on the bigger picture, delving only 
into those details that are of immediate relevance. 
6.1 How and Why Pāṇini Composed 1.4.2  
Having thrown light on the meaning of 1.4.2 in the previous chapters, I will now try to 
reconstruct how Pāṇini must have designed his system and, more pertinently, how he must 
have come up with what is arguably one of his most important rules – 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe 
paraṁ kāryam. It must be borne in mind that this is a purely speculative endeavour. 
Nonetheless, since it stands on the foundation of the evidence provided in previous chapters, 
and since it helps one gain a better understanding of the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī, I think 
it is worthwhile to engage in such speculation. 
Let us use nominal inflection as our example here, and the form devaiḥ (‘God’ masculine, 
instrumental plural) as our pivot for this discussion. We know that Pāṇini wanted to derive 
not only devaiḥ, but also other forms such as devāt (ablative singular), deveṣu (locative 
plural) etc.

To derive the aforementioned forms, Pāṇini came up with one common base to which he 
could add different affixes. As traditional grammarians have correctly pointed out, Pāṇini 
attributed great value to lāghava ‘brevity’, and thus he wanted to create the base in such a 
way that he would have to make the least number of changes to it. In other words, he wanted 
to write as few rules as possible. From the paradigm presented above, we can see that the 
candidates for the position of the common base were dev, deva, deve, devai, devā, devay etc. 
After taking into account several other inflected forms, Pāṇini concluded that it would be 
convenient and optimal to choose deva as the base and then to convert it, where required, to 
deve, devai, devā, devāy etc. using guṇa, vowel sandhi, substitution etc. Thus, he chose deva 
as the common base for deriving forms like devasya, devāya, devayoḥ, deve etc.  
deve 
 
devā                      deva                   devay 
 
devai 
Secondly, Pāṇini wanted to derive not only devaiḥ but also instrumental plural forms of bases 
ending in other sounds and / or of other genders, such as mālābhiḥ (‘garland’ feminine, 
ending in ā, instrumental plural), vāribhiḥ (‘water’ neuter, ending in i, instrumental plural) 
etc.  
kavibhiḥ 
mālābhiḥ 
marudbhiḥ 
vanaiḥ 
nadībhiḥ 
bhānubhiḥ  
vāribhiḥ 
devaiḥ 
 
He wanted to come up with one common affix each for every case-number combination (e.g., 
one affix for nominative plural, one for dative dual etc.). Given his goal of conciseness, he 
wanted to create these affixes in such a way that he would need to compose as few rules as 
possible to bring about changes in these affixes. So, when he was trying to decide what the 
instrumental plural affix should be, he examined all possible instrumental plural forms like 
kavibhiḥ, mālābhiḥ, marudbhiḥ, nadībhiḥ, bhānubhiḥ, vāribhiḥ, vanaiḥ, devaiḥ etc. He 
realized he had two options: he could have chosen either bhis or ais as the instrumental plural 
affix. He noticed that most of these forms end in bhis, and a minority of them end in ais. 
Because he wanted to compose as few rules as possible, he chose bhis as the instrumental 
plural affix. Consequently, he had to compose only one rule, namely 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais, to 

201 
 
deal with the affixation process for instrumental plurals. 7.1.9 teaches the substitution of bhis 
with ais when bhis is preceded by a nominal base ending in a.  
Using the two processes mentioned above, Pāṇini came up with different classes of nominal 
bases, on the basis of the final sound and grammatical gender of the base, and with 
declensional affixes, which he has listed in 4.1.2 sv-au-jas-am-auṭ-chaṣ-ṭā-bhyām-bhis-ṅe-
bhyām-bhyas-ṅasi-bhyām-bhyas-ṅas-os-ām-ṅy-os-sup.

Then, he composed certain rules teaching that the affix should be placed to the right-hand 
side of the base (cf. 3.1.1 pratyayaḥ, 3.1.2 paraś ca). But simply juxtaposing the affix with 
the base could not always give the correct form. So, what did Pāṇini do to deal with this 
problem? Naturally, he wrote rules to prescribe the requisite changes. 
Firstly, Pāṇini wrote rules to substitute certain affixes with other equivalent items (see 7.1.9 
discussed above). For example, in deva + Ṅe (dative singular), Ṅe had to be replaced with ya 
(cf. 7.1.13 ṅer yaḥ1). But *devaya is not the correct form. So, thereafter, Pāṇini had to modify 
the nominal base, i.e., replace a of deva with its dīrgha counterpart ā (cf. 7.3.102 supi ca2) to 
get the correct form devāya. Pāṇini decided to follow this order for the whole Aṣṭādhyāyī: 
first, he substituted the affix if required, and second, he modified the base (or both base and 
affix together, in case of ekādeśa) if required.  
Sometimes, only affix substitution was required, and base modification was not required. For 
example, consider deva + Ṅas (genitive singular). Here, Pāṇini simply had to replace Ṅas 
 
1 The affix Ṅe, when occurring after a base ending in a, is replaced with ya. 
2 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when followed by a 
declensional affix starting with yaÑ (y, v, r l, jh, bh or any nasal). 

202 
 
with sya (cf. 7.1.12 ṭāṅasiṅasām inātsyāḥ3) to get the correct form devasya. On the other 
hand, in some other cases, only base modification was required, and affix substitution was 
not required. For example, consider deva + bhyām (instrumental-dative-ablative dual). Here, 
Pāṇini simply had to replace a of deva with its long counterpart (cf. 7.3.102 supi ca4) to get 
the correct form devābhyām. Similarly, consider deva + bhyas (dative-ablative plural). Here, 
Pāṇini simply had to replace a of deva with e (cf. 7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et5) to get the 
correct form devebhyaḥ. But regardless of the situation, Pāṇini always followed the same 
order: first, he substituted the affix if required, and then he modified the base (or both base 
and affix together, in case of ekādeśa) if required. 
Now, consider deva + bhis (instrumental plural). Here too, first Pāṇini substituted the affix 
bhis with ais (cf. 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais), and then, in deva + ais, modified both base and affix by 
performing an ekādeśa operation i.e., by replacing a + ai with ai (cf. 6.1.88 vr̥ ddhir eci6). 
This led to the correct form devaiḥ. However, he realized that students using his grammar 
may encounter a hurdle when deriving the form devaiḥ. He noticed that at the step deva + 
bhis, 7.1.9 ato bhisa ais is not the only rule applicable: 7.3.102 supi ca and 7.3.103 
bahuvacane jhaly et, which he had composed to derive the forms devābhyām and devebhyaḥ 
respectively, are also applicable.  
deva               +              bhis 
 
                                     7.3.102                 7.3.103             7.1.9 
When multiple rules became simultaneously applicable, he decided to call the competition 
between the rule(s) applicable to the LHS operand and the rule(s) applicable to the RHS 
operand, vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’. As we have seen above, Pāṇini’s goal was to 
replace the affix first, where required, and only then to modify the base (or modify both base 
and affix together, in case of ekādeśa) where required. So, despite the applicability of the 
 
3 The affix Ṭā, ṄasI and Ṅas, when occurring after a base ending in a, are replaced with ina, āt and 
sya respectively. 
4 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with its long equivalent when a yaÑ-initial 
declensional affix follows. 
5 The a at the end of a nominal base is replaced with e when a plural declensional affix starting with 
jhaL (a non-nasal stop or a fricative) follows. 
6 Vr̥ ddhi (ā, ai, au) replaces both a and the eC vowel (e, o, ai, au) immediately following it. 

203 
 
LHS rules 7.3.102 and 7.3.103 at this step, Pāṇini wanted the RHS rule 7.1.9, and not any of 
these two LHS rules, to apply at this step. Thus, he stated 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam 
“in the event of vipratiṣedha ‘mutual opposition’ (i.e., DOI), the para kārya ‘RHS operation’ 
takes place”. Upon applying 7.1.9, we get deva + ais, and rules like 7.3.102 supi ca and 
7.3.103 bahuvacane jhaly et are no longer applicable. Here, the rule 6.1.88 vr̥ ddhir eci 
applies, giving the correct form, devaiḥ.  
One pertinent question that merits our attention here is: while making changes, why does 
Pāṇini start from the right-hand side (i.e., the affix) and then move leftwards (i.e., towards the 
interface between the affix and the base)? Notice that, in the forms devaiḥ, devasya, 
devānām, deveṣu etc., dev, which we can call the ‘LHS part’, is common to all the forms. So, 
the LHS part does not need to undergo any modification whatsoever. But one may ask, why 
not first make changes in the middle i.e., at the interface between base and affix and then 
move rightwards to make changes in the affix? This would be counterproductive, because the 
changes at the base-affix interface depend on the phonological composition of the affix. For 
these reasons, when making modifications, it is optimal for Pāṇini to start from the right end 
and move leftwards. 
Pāṇini used this SSRI resolution mechanism not only for nominal inflection, but for other 
kinds of derivations too – such as verbal inflection, primary and secondary derivatives, 
compounds etc. While in the examples of DOI discussed above, the two rules are applicable 
to two different items i.e., one to the base and the other to the affix, Pāṇini built his system in 
such a way that he could extend the application of 1.4.2 to those cases of DOI wherein both 
rules are applicable to two different parts of the same item.  
Where required, he also composed other rules to deal with DOI. For example, he composed 
rules 1.4.13 yasmāt pratyayavidhis tadādi pratyaye’ṅgam and 6.4.1 aṅgasya to correctly 
derive forms like edhante, dadhati etc. I have discussed this in detail in sections 4.1 and 4.2, 
chapter 4. He also composed rules like 6.4.22 asiddhavad atrābhāt and 8.2.1 
pūrvatrāsiddham to counter the impact of 1.4.2 on DOI. I have discussed this in detail in 
chapter 5. Lastly, note that Pāṇini did not compose any rules to deal with SOI. He expected 
us to choose the more specific rule, as I have shown in detail in examples 1 and 2 of section 
2.8, chapter 2. 
Now that we have discussed how Pāṇini must have come up with 1.4.2, let us examine how 
the tradition interpreted 1.4.2. 

204 
 
6.2 A Summary of Post-Pāṇinian Ideas on 1.4.2  
Through Kātyāyana’s vārttikas, we know that he interprets para in 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam as ‘the rule which comes later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’. For example, 
consider 3.1.67 sārvadhātuke yak which teaches that affix yaK occurs after a verbal root 
when a sārvadhātuka affix which denotes bhāva or karman follows. Consider vt. 47 on this 
rule: vipratiṣedhād dhi śapo balīyastvam ‘Given the vipratiṣedha8 [between yaK (cf. 3.1.67 
sārvadhātuke yak) and ŚaP (cf. 3.1.68 kartari śap)], ŚaP is more powerful [and wins, 
because it is para i.e., taught later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī].’  
Note that this vārttika makes an incorrect statement. There is no conflict at all here: yaK is 
added to verbal roots followed by sārvadhātuka affixes denoting bhāva ‘action’ or karman 
‘object’ whereas ŚaP is added when the sārvadhātuka affix denotes kartr̥  ‘agent’. In fact, we 
come across many such errors in Kātyāyana’s vārttikas.  
But I think that it is unwarranted to look for ‘correct’ statements in the vārttikas. This is 
because, in my opinion, Kātyāyana’s vārttikas are often a medium for him to share all kinds 
of thoughts with fellow grammarians – not just the ‘correct’ ones. Very often, we find him 
use na vā ‘or rather not’ and ca ‘and’ in a series of consecutive vārttikas to discuss alternative 
or even contradicting possibilities and explanations. Let me give an example relevant to the 
topic of rule conflict. Consider vts. 3, 4 and 5 on 7.1.6 śīṅo ruṭ9 (Mbh III.243.12-21).  
Vt. 3 jhādeśād āḍ leṭi  
‘[It must be stated that, contrary to 1.4.2, the introduction of] āṬ, [which is taught by the 
pūrva rule 3.4.94 leṭo’ḍāṭau10 wins against] the substitution of jh [which is taught by the para 
rule 7.1.5 ātmanepadeṣv anataḥ11].’ 
 
 
 
7 Mbh II.59.1. 
8 I will translate and discuss vipratiṣedha later in this chapter from Kātyāyana’s perspective. 
9 An aT which replaces a jh which is the initial sound of an affix preceded by śīṄ, takes the augment 
rUṬ. 
10 Augments aṬ and āṬ are introduced, in turn (paryāyeṇa), to affixes which replace LEṬ. 
11 A jh which is the initial sound of an ātmanepada affix preceded by a verbal base that does not end 
in a is replaced with at. 

205 
 
Vt. 4 na vā nityatvād āṭaḥ  
‘Or rather [this does] not [need to be stated] because [the rule teaching] āṬ is nitya [and thus 
defeats the other rule which is anitya].’ 
Vt. 5 antaraṅgalakṣaṇatvāc ca 
‘And [also] because [the rule teaching] āṬ is antaraṅga [and thus defeats the other rule which 
is bahiraṅga].’ 
This style of discussing multiple possibilities without striving to always be correct, is very 
much akin to Patañjali’s style, which also involves a discussion about the pros and cons of 
various perspectives. In both Kātyāyana’s and Patañjali’s work, we find no rigidity or 
urgency to establish the truth. Instead, their work is characterized by curiosity and a 
willingness to critically examine a motley of ideas.  
Coming back to the topic of para, suffice it to say that regardless of the correctness of its 
contents, vt. 4 on 3.1.67, which I have discussed above, buttresses the proposition that 
Kātyāyana interpreted para as ‘the rule which comes later in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī’. And while this interpretation of para taught by Kātyāyana – alongside tools like 
nitya, antaraṅga etc. discussed by him – has been fully endorsed and internalized by the later 
tradition, most traditional and modern scholars have almost entirely overlooked a very 
important idea about paratva that we find in a vārttika on 6.1.158 anudāttaṁ padam 
ekavarjam. 
6.1.158 teaches that a pada is entirely low-pitched (anudātta) with the exception of one 
syllable. But how should we decide which syllable is not low-pitched? Is it a syllable of the 
prakr̥ ti ‘base’ or a syllable of the pratyaya ‘affix’? After discussing this topic in multiple 
vārttikas on this rule, Kātyāyana says, in vt. 1212: śāstraparavipratiṣedhāniyamād vā 
śabdaparavipratiṣedhāt siddham ‘[in the event of vipratiṣedha between two operations] 
because it has not been [explicitly] mandated that paratva of rules [alone should be used to 
resolve] vipratiṣedha, alternatively paratva of sounds [may also be used to] accomplish [the 
task of resolving] vipratiṣedha’.13 In other words, here, Kātyāyana suggests that alongside 
inferring that the rule that is para i.e., that comes later in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī 
 
12 Mbh III.100.12. 
13 Here, Nāgeśa, in his Uddyota, refers to another discussion on this subject on 1.1.57 acaḥ parasmin 
pūrvavidhau by Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa. 

206 
 
wins, we may also infer that the operation that is applicable to the para i.e., RHS sound or 
group of sounds wins.   
This shows that Kātyāyana was either exposed to or himself thought about the possibility that 
para in 1.4.2 could stand for the RHS operation. If he had chosen to further develop this line 
of thought, this idea could potentially have reached its logical conclusion, namely the correct 
interpretation of para in 1.4.2. One could argue that, by choosing to focus on and 
subsequently by accepting the wrong interpretation from amongst the two possible 
interpretations of para discussed in the aforementioned vārttika, Kātyāyana completely 
changed the developmental trajectory of the Pāṇinian tradition. Kātyāyana’s successors too 
failed to recognize the sheer potential of this vārttika, and thus the key to the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s 
algorithm remained before everyone’s eyes and yet hidden from everyone’s mind.  
One key repercussion of Kātyāyana’s belief that para in 1.4.2 stands for ‘the rule that comes 
later in the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s serial order’ must have been that he likely got numerous incorrect 
forms at the end of derivations where he solved SSRI using his interpretation of 1.4.2. 
Perhaps it is to avoid these undesirable outcomes - wherever possible - that he decided to 
reduce the jurisdiction of 1.4.2. For example, in vt. 1 on 1.4.2, he defines vipratiṣedha in a 
way that allows him to exclude anavakāśa-sāvakāśa pairs from the jurisdiction of 1.4.2: dvau 
prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin sa vipratiṣedhaḥ (1)14 ‘[When] two rules [which are] 
applicable elsewhere [become applicable] to the same place, this [is called] vipratiṣedha’. 
Thus, an SSRI between two sāvakāśa rules (i.e., rules which are applicable elsewhere) is 
called vipratiṣedha. We know that an SSRI can be either a conflict scenario or a non-conflict 
one. But as I have said in previous chapters, Kātyāyana is, for the most part, interested in 
conflict. Thus, I will take the liberty, for the sake of this chapter, to translate the traditional 
interpretation of vipratiṣedha as ‘conflict between sāvakāśa rules’.  
In vt. 2 on 1.4.2, he says: ekasmin yugapat asaṁbhavāt pūrvaparaprāpter ubhayaprasaṅgaḥ 
“[Given the] impossibility [of] co-application at one [i.e., the same step, there arises] the 
undesirable scenario of both pūrva and para being applicable.” In vt. 5, Kātyāyana says: 
apratipattir vobhayos tulyabalatvāt ‘Or [maybe this results in] the failure of both [rules] to 
apply because of [their] equal strength’. In vt. 6 he says: tatra pratipattyartham etad vacanam 
‘So, this [sūtra] has been formulated in order to instruct us about this [i.e., the decision 
regarding which rule should apply]’. From vts. 1, 2, 5 and 6 on 1.4.2, we can conclude that, 
 
14 Mbh I.304.10-305.3. 

207 
 
according to Kātyāyana, the conflict between two sāvakāśa rules is called vipratiṣedha, and 
that these two rules are treated as tulyabala ‘of equal strength’. Note that this is the only 
occasion on which Kātyāyana uses the term tulyabala. Patañjali too uses the word tulyabala 
only once – when commenting on vt. 5 on 1.4.2.15 
Kātyāyana has composed several vārttikas discussing terms like nitya, anitya, antaraṅga, 
bahiraṅga, apavāda, utsarga, anavakāśa and sāvakāśa. This indicates that he was familiar 
with or himself constructed these concepts and established relationships between nitya and 
anitya rules, between antaraṅga and bahiraṅga rules, between apavāda and utsarga rules, 
and between anavakāśa and sāvakāśa rules. While Patañjali does not always agree with 
Kātyāyana, he has embraced all these concepts wholeheartedly in his commentary. We get no 
evidence of Kātyāyana connecting these concepts directly with tulyabalatva, and only one 
piece of evidence of him establishing a direct link between one of these tools and 
vipratiṣedha, which is as follows. On 6.1.135 suṭ kāt pūrvaḥ ‘The augment sUṬ is added 
before k16’, Kātyāyana says, in vt. 717: avipratiṣedho vā bahiraṅgalakṣaṇatvāt 
‘[Alternatively, one can argue that this is] not a case of vipratiṣedha because [sUṬ is] 
bahiraṅga’. This shows that he excludes antaraṅga-bahiraṅga pairs from the domain of 
1.4.2. 
But even after inventing tools like nitya, antaraṅga, apavāda and anavakāśa, Kātyāyana was 
unable to resolve certain conflicts, especially those involving DOI mutual blocking, using any 
of the aforementioned tools. On many occasions, solving such conflicts using 1.4.2 too led to 
an incorrect answer at the end of the derivation.18 Thus, he wrote the ‘pūrvavipratiṣiddha’ 
vārttikas. By using the expression ‘pūrvavipratiṣiddha’, Kātyāyana points out that instead of 
the para sūtra, which should win as per his interpretation of 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ 
kāryam, it is the pūrva sūtra which emerges victorious. We have already looked at some such 
vārttikas in chapter 2, so I will simply mention one of them here. On 7.1.96 striyāṁ ca, vt. 
1019 reads: guṇavr̥ ddhyauttvatr̥ jvadbhāvebhyo num pūrvavipratiṣiddham ‘In case of 
vipratiṣedha, the pūrva sūtra, which teaches the insertion of the augment nUM, takes 
 
15 It must be stated though that this passage is reproduced verbatim by Patañjali in his comments on 
vt. 3 on 6.1.85 antādivac ca (Mbh III.59.20-60.6). 
16 Note that this is an adhikāra rule. 
17 Mbh III.93.1. 
18 For instance, see example 5 of section 2.7, chapter 2. 
19 Mbh III.275.23. 

208 
 
precedence over para sūtras which teach (i) guṇa, (ii) vr̥ ddhi, (iii) auttva, (iv) tr̥ jvadbhāva’. 
By writing this and other pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Kātyāyana draws attention to the 
perceived failures of / loopholes in / exceptions to the rule 1.4.2.  
Commenting on most pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas, Patañjali says that they are not required at 
all. He gives various reasons for this, of which the following one is used by him on multiple 
occasions. On vt. 10 on 7.1.96 stated above, he says: na vaktavyaḥ. iṣṭavācī paraśabdaḥ. 
vipratiṣedhe paraṁ yad iṣṭaṁ tad bhavati ‘[This] should not be said. The word para means 
desirable. In [the event of] vipratiṣedha, the para i.e., desirable [rule] applies.’ It is evident 
that in this context Patañjali tries to defend 1.4.2 against Kātyāyana’s criticism. In fact, this is 
anything but an isolated instance: scholars like Goldstücker (1861: 119-121) and Weber 
(1872: 297-298) were amongst the earliest modern scholars to argue that Kātyāyana was 
severely critical of Pāṇini’s sūtras, and that Patañjali invested significant effort in countering 
such negative remarks. While many scholars, starting with Kielhorn, have presented rebuttals 
to this, even Kielhorn (1876: 50) cannot deny “that Patañjali has refuted some of the (i.e., 
Kātyāyana’s)20 objections, that he has rejected some of the additional rules of Kātyāyana.”  
Coming back to vt. 10 on 7.1.96, I would argue that by hurrying to dismiss Kātyāyana’s 
pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas using a rather feeble argument, namely that para means iṣṭa, 
Patañjali missed the opportunity to discover the truth of 1.4.2. Instead, if he had accepted 
Kātyāyana’s statement as valid and had pondered over the cause of this phenomenon, he 
could possibly have realized that Kātyāyana’s interpretation of para itself was incorrect, and 
that it was this misinterpretation which had led him to write the pūrvavipratiṣiddha vārttikas. 
This would certainly have been a far superior defence of Pāṇini’s rule 1.4.2 against 
Kātyāyana’s criticism than the one mounted by Patañjali.  
After the composition of the Mahābhāṣya, ideas about the terms vipratiṣedha, para, 
tulyabala, and the various tools of conflict resolution discussed above began to take more 
concrete shape. Direct links and relationships between these concepts came to be established. 
For example, on 1.4.2, the Kāśikā, which was written in the 7th century AD, says:  
yatra dvau prasaṅgāv anyārthāv ekasmin yugapat prāpnutaḥ sa tulyabalavirodho 
vipratiṣedhaḥ. 
tasmin 
vipratiṣedhe

utsargāpavādanityānityāntaraṅgabahiraṅgeṣu tulyabalatā nāstīti nāyam asya yogasya 
viṣayaḥ, balavataiva tatra bhavitavyam.  
‘When two operations which can be applied at other sites become simultaneously applicable 
at one [and the same site], this is called a conflict of equal strength or vipratiṣedha. In the 
event of vipratiṣedha, the rule that comes later [in the serial order of the Aṣṭādhyāyī] prevails. 
A general rule (utsarga) and its exception (apavāda), or a nitya rule and an anitya rule, or an 
antaraṅga and a bahiraṅga rule, are not rules of equal strength. These pairs do not fall under 
the jurisdiction of this rule. In these cases, the stronger rule wins.’ 
Notice that, unlike Kātyāyana and Patañjali, the authors of the Kāśikā explicitly exclude 
nitya-anitya, antaraṅga-bahiraṅga and apavāda-utsarga pairs from the ambit of vipratiṣedha 
by calling them ‘not tulyabala’. Thereafter, in both Pāṇinian and non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣā 
literature, we find multiple versions of the same paribhāṣā which compares the ‘strengths’ of 
the tools mentioned above. The earliest Pāṇinian paribhāṣā treatise to include it is the 
Paribhāṣāpāṭha 
of 
Puruṣottamadeva 
written 
in 
the 
12th 
century. 
It 
reads: 
pūrvaparanityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaraṁ balīyaḥ (Pbh. 39). ‘Of [these five kinds of 
rules, - viz.] a preceding [rule], a subsequent [rule], a nitya [rule], an antaraṅga [rule], and an 
apavāda [rule], - each following [rule] possesses greater force [than any one of, or all, the 
rules which are mentioned before it].’21  
In sum, the relationships between tulyabala, vipratiṣedha, nitya, antaraṅga, para, apavāda 
etc. were fully and concretely established by the twelfth century. Alongside the paribhāṣās 
teaching these tools, dozens of paribhāṣās teaching exceptions to these tools were also 
written by the paribhāṣākāras. On this account, given its unwieldy and complicated nature, 
the traditional solution completely fails the Occam’s razor test. Additionally, the flexibility of 
ideas, free thinking, willingness to consider a wide variety of possibilities and alternatives, 
which, as stated earlier, are so characteristic of the early tradition i.e., Kātyāyana’s and 
Patañjali’s work, came to be replaced by a willing acceptance of rigid, ossified, established 
and widely-accepted ‘facts’ and ‘truths’ in the later tradition – in particular, in paribhāṣā 
literature. It is noteworthy that many of these paribhāṣās are anitya ‘not always applicable’ 
by the tradition’s own admission!

Here, one may ask: why do the Kāśikā and the paribhāṣā texts not question the correctness of 
Kātyāyana’s interpretation of the term para in 1.4.2? I think the first broad reason is that, 
along with Pāṇini, who composed the foundational treatise of the tradition, Kātyāyana and 
Patañjali too came to be worshipped in the tradition, which might have made it almost 
unthinkable for subsequent scholars to disagree with Kātyāyana or Patañjali over such 
fundamental aspects of the grammar as the meaning of para in 1.4.222. It must be noted that 
even though the Kāśikā does present an alternative viewpoint to that of the Mahābhāṣya on 
many occasions, it completely embraces Patañjali’s ideas on this subject. Secondly, even 
amongst the three munis, Patañjali’s word superseded Kātyāyana’s and Kātyāyana’s word 
superseded Pāṇini’s, right from the time of Kaiyaṭa, who famously stated: yathottaraṁ hi 
munitrayasya prāmāṇyam23 ‘Among the three munis, the authority of later muni supersedes 
that of his predecessor(s)’24. Thus, Patañjali became the most important person in the 
tradition, surpassing Pāṇini himself, whose work he had set out to expound on. So, 
hypothetically speaking, even if a traditional scholar had discovered that Patañjali had 
misinterpreted para in 1.4.2, he would have preferred Patañjali’s interpretation to Pāṇini’s in 
all likelihood! 
One would have expected the tradition to start paying ever closer attention to the topic of rule 
conflict with the writing of the Kaumudī texts, the main goal of which was to teach students 
how to perform derivations. To achieve this goal, the Kaumudī texts took the radical decision 
to reorder the rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī so that a rule would be taught in the Kaumudī only 
when it applied at some step in a certain derivation. However, unfortunately, these texts did 
not challenge the existing interpretation of para in 1.4.2 and, like previous texts, performed 
derivations using the traditional tools for conflict resolution. In fact, not only did the 
Kaumudī texts fail to discover the correct meaning of 1.4.2, but they also unwittingly ensured 
that coming generations would not decipher the same.  
They did this by shifting the focus of the tradition from the comprehensive functioning of the 
Pāṇinian machine to the many individual products of the machine, namely, individual 
derivations of various forms. Over time, students of the Kaumudī got so familiar with these 
derivations that now, they do not have to and, consequently, do not, stop at most steps of the 
 
22 Deshpande (1998, 2019) discusses this topic in great detail.  
23 Another popular version of this, also written by Kaiyaṭa is: uttarottaraṁ munīnāṁ prāmāṇyam. 
24 See Pradīpa on Mahābhāṣya on 1.1.29. 

211 
 
derivation to ask themselves: which rules are applicable at this step? Which of these rules 
should I apply? And why? And if pupils do apply conflict resolution tools of their own accord 
and end up getting the wrong form, they are not encouraged by their teachers to ask why. 
Instead, they are advised to consult the Kaumudī texts to ‘correct’ themselves i.e., to 
memorize the explanation offered by their authors. 
This chain of accepting what previous scholars have said was finally broken by many modern 
Indologists, including Houben (2003), who asked if Pāṇini’s grammar is meant to function 
like a machine at all25, and Bronkhorst (2004) who questioned the ‘linearity’ of Pāṇinian 
derivations.26 Others have tried to make changes in some parts of the traditional conflict 
resolution mechanism. For example, multiple scholars, starting with Faddegon (1936), have 
advocated restricting the jurisdiction of 1.4.2 to 1.4.2-2.2.38. Cardona (1970: 57-58) has 
proposed limited blocking, which essentially deals with more complex cases of SOI, even 
though he does not state this explicitly.27  
Joshi and Kiparsky interpret vipratiṣedha as ‘mutual blocking’ and state that “for…so-called 
vipratiṣedha, no general solution has been found”28 by them.29 However, they do propose a 
solution for those cases which involve unidirectional blocking, namely the siddha principle. 
What it essentially does is resort to the nitya principle30 to solve not only these cases which 
the tradition solves using nityatva, but also those which it solves using antaraṅgatva. 
Bronkhorst (1984: 310-313) and Cardona (1999: 154-161) have correctly criticized the 
reasoning behind this principle.31  
 
25 I hope I have proven through this thesis that Pāṇini intended for his grammar to function like a 
well-oiled machine. But I do not want to deny that he may have made certain mistakes by virtue of 
being human or that interpolations and changes occurred in the Aṣṭādhyāyī at the hands of later 
scholars. I think these factors certainly had a negative impact on the functioning of Pāṇini’s machine.  
26 See section 1.3, chapter 1 for a detailed discussion on this subject. 
27 For more on this, see example 3 in section 4.4, chapter 4. 
28 Kiparsky 1987: 295. 
29 Kiparsky (1991: 349) also says, “Joshi and I were unable to find any general way to predict which 
rule wins in such a situation [i.e., vipratiṣedha, which they interpret as mutual blocking], although 
solutions for some special subtypes of vipratiṣedha were suggested.” Note that the words in the 
square brackets in this quote have been added by me for the sake of clarity.

212 
 
Even though none of these scholars have been able to offer a radically different interpretation 
of 1.4.2, their willingness to ask questions, to propose new ideas and to challenge the 
traditional method of conflict resolution inspired me to do the same, eventually leading me to 
the interpretation of 1.4.2 I have presented in this thesis.  
In the following section, I will discuss how my findings can help us better understand other 
aspects of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and linguistics in the future.  
 
6.3 The Way Forward 
I have not dealt with rules teaching accentuation in this thesis. However, accentuation is 
inseparable from Pāṇinian Sanskrit and thus, I hope to conduct research in the future on 
whether we can correctly derive accented forms using my method of tackling SSRI. 
Conversely, using my method of dealing with SSRI may enhance our knowledge about how 
accentuation actually works in the Pāṇinian system.  
Secondly, I have not explored rules taught particularly for deriving Vedic forms in this thesis. 
However, in the future, research on derivations involving such rules may enable us to verify 
the correctness of my findings about Pāṇini’s SSRI mechanism. It could also assist us in 
understanding which parts of Vedic literature Pāṇini was familiar with, thereby adding to the 
work done by Thieme (1935), Bronkhorst (1991) and others on this subject. In sum, such 
research will improve our understanding of the relationship between Pāṇini and the Vedas. 
Even though the question of whether certain rules were interpolated into the ‘original’ 
version of Aṣṭādhyāyī32 is not closely connected with the topic of SSRI, we can benefit from 
studying these topics together. For example, if we get the incorrect form at the end of a 
derivation in which we have resolved the SSRI using my method, then, in the presence of 
supporting evidence, we can consider the possibility that the rule in question has been edited 
or constitutes an interpolation.33 
While it may seem that anuvr̥ tti34 does not directly influence or get influenced by SSRI, there 
are some strong links between the two topics. Anuvr̥ tti alone helps us understand the exact 
 
32 For a detailed discussion on this, see Joshi and Roodbergen (1983).  
33 See example 1 of section 3.1, chapter 3 to understand this better.  
34 For detailed studies on anuvr̥ tti, see Joshi and Bhate (1983, 1984). 

213 
 
contents of any rule, and without knowing the contents of a rule, we cannot establish whether 
it interacts with other rules at the same step. So, developing a sound understanding of anuvr̥ tti 
can help us better appreciate the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. Also, if we get the incorrect 
form at the end of a derivation in which we have resolved the SSRI using my method, then 
we can reconsider if the right words have been continued through anuvr̥ tti into the rules 
involved in SSRI.35 
Now let us look at how my findings about SSRI in the Aṣṭādhyāyī can potentially open up 
new avenues of research in certain disciplines related to Pāṇinian studies. Let us start by 
talking about Sanskrit computational linguistics36. One of the main goals of this field is to 
teach Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī to the computer, so that when we feed the bases, affixes and the 
speaker’s intention37 into the computer, the computer can perform the derivation for us and 
give us the correct final form. Understanding how Pāṇini deals with SSRI and knowing the 
actual meaning of 1.4.2 will surely help scholars to make progress in achieving this goal. 
My findings can also help develop new ideas for modern theoretical linguistics, and more 
specifically, phonology. In Western phonology, Chomsky and Halle (1968) postulated that, 
each language has its own fixed order of applying rules in derivations. This is called extrinsic 
ordering. Kiparsky (1968), on the other hand, proposed that the order of rule application 
could be viewed as being dependent on the formal relationships between rules, namely, 
whether one rule feeds or bleeds the other rule.38 This is called intrinsic ordering.  
Pāṇini’s derivations are neither extrinsically nor intrinsically ordered. In fact, one need not 
worry about the concept of rule order at all when performing Pāṇinian derivations. This is 
because the choice of the rule which should apply at any given step, depends neither on 
whether it feeds or bleeds another rule, not on any predetermined order of application. 
Instead, this decision is made by the ingenious algorithm devised by Pāṇini to deal with 
 
35 For instance, consider example 2 of section 3.1, chapter 3.  
36 ‘Sanskrit Computational Linguistics – First and Second International Symposia’ helps one gain a 
good understanding about the diversity and scope of the field.  
37 By ‘speaker’s intention’, I mean, information about the exact form he or she wishes to derive. For 
example, ‘imperative passive third person singular’.  
38 A feeds B if the application of A facilitates the application of B, and P bleeds Q if the application of 
P obstructs the application of Q. 

214 
 
SSRI. Perhaps modern linguistics can overcome the shortcomings of extrinsic and intrinsic 
ordering by experimenting with Pāṇini’s model.  
Finally, my work on Pāṇini’s SSRI mechanism can also potentially propel further research on 
the topic of ‘natural language complexity’. In computational theory, attempts have been made 
to understand how complex a formal language (i.e., an artificial language used in computer 
science) is using the Chomskyan hierarchy (based on Chomsky: 1959), which consists of four 
different levels of formal language grammars and the ‘machines’ that correspond with them. 
Linguists have also tried to situate natural languages in this hierarchy. Let us look at the 
hierarchy before we discuss this topic further.

  A      aB 
 
Key: 
a = terminal symbol   
A, B = non-terminal symbol      
α, β, γ, δ, θ  = string of symbols39 
 
39 This information has a purely indicative value but no claim to exhaustiveness. There are some 
constraints on some of these strings depending on whether or not they can contain terminals, whether 
or not they can be empty etc. but I won’t delve into this because it is not of much importance in the 
present context.   

215 
 
Please read the following three statements carefully in the context of the table presented 
above: 
(i) In A  γ (Type 2), if the string γ contains only one symbol, namely the terminal symbol a, 
then this rule can be rewritten as A  a (Type 3). Similarly, if the string γ contains only two 
symbols, namely aB, then this rule can be rewritten as A  aB (Type 3). These are only two 
of many possibilities. Thus, regular grammars (Type 3) constitute a subset of context free 
grammars (Type 2). 
(ii) In αΑβ  αγβ (Type 1), if both α and β are empty, then this rule can be written as A  γ 
(Type 2). This is only one of many possibilities. Thus, context free grammars (Type 2) 
constitute a subset of context sensitive grammars (Type 1).  
(iii) In δ  θ (Type 0), if the string δ is αΑβ and if the string θ is αγβ, then this rule can be 
rewritten as αΑβ  αγβ (Type 1). This is only one of many possibilities. Thus, context 
sensitive grammars (Type 1) constitute a subset of recursively enumerable grammars (Type 
0). 
Therefore, we can represent these grammars as follows: 
 
 
 
Type 0
Type 1
Type 2
Type 3

216 
 
As can be seen from the diagram above: 
(i) Type 3 grammars can produce Type 3 languages.  
(ii) Type 2 grammars can produce Type 3 and Type 2 languages. 
(iii) Type 1 grammars can produce Type 3, Type 2 and Type 1 languages. 
(iv) Type 0 grammars can produce Type 3, Type 2, Type 1 and Type 0 languages. 
Note that in terms of productive power, the grammars can be compared as follows (where G1 
> G2 stands for ‘G1 is more powerful than G2’):  
Type 0 > Type 1 > Type 2 > Type 3 
As stated above, even though this hierarchy is primarily meant for formal languages, linguists 
have attempted to situate natural languages within it. They have shown that Dutch (Bresnan 
et al 1982), Swiss German (Shieber 1985) and Bambara (Culy 1985) are neither regular 
(Type 3) nor context free (Type 2). Scholars like Fowler (1965), Staal (1965, 1966), Hyman 
(2007), Penn and Kiparsky (2012) and Lowe (in press) have discussed the Aṣṭādhyāyī’s 
computational ability, the characteristics of the language it produces, and whether and how 
we can situate such a language, i.e., Pāṇinian Sanskrit, in the Chomskyan hierarchy.  
I think that there are several loopholes in the thesis that we can meaningfully situate natural 
languages – which are significantly different in their nature, composition and purpose, from 
formal languages – in a hierarchy meant for formal languages. However, the outcome of my 
research has an interesting parallel with one aspect of the Chomskyan hierarchy which I think 
merits further exploration. The following diagram illustrates how a Pāṇinian derivation would 
look in the absence of Pāṇini’s algorithm for dealing with SSRI. Let us assume, for the sake 
of this discussion, that two rules are applicable at every step of the derivation. The derivation 
starts at State 1 and the correct final form is State 4h. 
 

217 
 
 
 
This is a three-step derivation. Step 1 takes us from state 1 to state 2, step 2 from state 2 to 
state 3, and lastly step 3 from state 3 to state 4. To reach state 4h one has to make three 
correct decisions: one has to choose state 2b in step 1, state 3d in step 2, and state 4h in step 
3. But if there had existed no internal algorithm in Pāṇini’s machine, one could have ended 
up with any of the eight final answers (cf. state 4), and the probability of getting the correct 
answer would have been be 1/8. However, by teaching his solution for SSRI, Pāṇini has 
converted the above machine into the following machine: 
 
 
 
To borrow terms from computational theory, Pāṇini has converted his ‘non-deterministic 
machine’, which could potentially proceed along multiple derivational paths, into a 
deterministic one, which proceeds along a single path dictated by the algorithm. A 
deterministic machine is desirable because it produces only correct forms whereas a non-
deterministic machine is not desirable because it produces both correct and incorrect forms. 
Penn and Kiparsky (2012) say: “through the lens of contemporary NLP40, the most amazing 
fact about the Aṣṭādhyāyī is not that it produces so many correct derivations, after all, but that 
it simultaneously avoids so many incorrect ones.”

218 
 
Now let us use this information to situate Pāṇinian Sanskrit in this hierarchy. We already 
know that we find rules which resemble context sensitive rules (cf. αΑβ  αγβ) in Pāṇini’s 
grammar. Since regular (Type 3) and context free (Type 2) grammars do not contain such 
rules, we can infer that Pāṇini’s grammar is neither regular nor context-free. But does the 
presence of context-sensitive rules make Pāṇini’s grammar context sensitive (Type 1)? 
Context-sensitive grammars in the Chomskyan hierarchy correspond with non-deterministic 
linear bounded automata. But as I said, Pāṇini’s grammar is deterministic. Thus, we cannot 
call the Aṣṭādhyāyī a Type 1 (context sensitive) grammar. What kind of grammar is the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī then? I trust that scholars will be able to answer this question in the future with 
the help of the information I have provided above. 
In sum, I am confident that my findings about Pāṇini’s algorithm for regulating SSRI will 
enable us to make substantial advances not only in the field of Pāṇinian studies but also in 
multiple allied disciplines. pāṇinaye namaḥ!

Appendix A: Some Pāṇinian Metarules on Substitution 
Introduction 
In this thesis, we have focused on vidhi sūtras ‘operational rules’, and to be precise, on how 
we choose one rule from amongst the two or more operational rules which are simultaneously 
applicable in a derivation. While operational rules play an important, perhaps central role in 
Pāṇinian derivations, they cannot be correctly interpreted or applied without the help of two 
other categories of rules, namely saṁjñā sūtras ‘definition rules’ and paribhāṣā sūtras 
‘metarules’.  
We have already observed how the more specific rule wins in case of competition between 
saṁjñā rules, in section 1.6, chapter 1. In appendices A and B, we will look at some cases of 
competition between paribhāṣā rules which the tradition has failed to solve satisfactorily. 
Pāṇini has not given any explicit instructions about which of the two competing paribhāṣā 
rules must be chosen. In keeping with the general-exception template that pervades the entire 
Aṣṭādhyāyī, I think that the more specific rule emerges victorious in cases of competition 
between paribhāṣā rules. 
Competition Between Paribhāṣā Rules 1.1.52-1.1.55 
In order to examine an example of competition between these paribhāṣā rules, let us derive the 
imperative third-person singular form of the root likh ‘to write’. I will not discuss DOI and SOI 
here since our focus is on metarules. Nonetheless, I will perform the derivation bearing in mind 
my method of solving SOI and DOI: likh + LOṬ (3.3.162 loṭ ca)  likh + tiP (3.4.77 lasya, 
3.4.78 tip-tas-jhi…1)  likh + tu (3.4.86 er uḥ)  likh + ŚaP + tu (3.1.68 kartari śap). Since 
likh + ŚaP cannot undergo any other operations which are not triggered by tu, we can write 
likh + ŚaP as likha. likha is an aṅga with respect to tu. Thus, we can apply 7.1.35 tuhyostātaṅ 
āśiṣy anyatarasyām here. This rule teaches that tu and hi should be replaced with tātAṄ in a 
benedictive form. If this rule is applied, which part of tu does tātAṄ replace? To get the correct 
answer, likhatāt, tātAṄ needs to replace tu entirely. But what do the relevant metarules have to 
say in this regard? Do they help us derive the correct answer, likhatāt? Let us look at them: 
 
 
1 The full sūtra reads: tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mip-vas-mas-t(a)-ātām-jha-thās-āthām-dhvam-iḍ-vahi-
mahiṅ.  

220 
 
1.1.52 alo’ntyasya: a substitute replaces the final sound of the item for which it is taught. 
1.1.53 ṅic ca (alaḥ antyasya): a Ṅ-marked substitute replaces the final sound of the item for 
which it is taught.  
1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya (alaḥ): a substitute taught for the following item replaces its first sound. 
1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya: a multi-sound substitute or a substitute marked with Ś replaces the 
entirety of the item for which it is taught. 
Before we go further, I should clarify the traditional interpretation of 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya. 
According to the tradition, the metarule 1.1.54 governs only those rules which follow the 
following template: the substitute B1 is taught for B when B is preceded by A (where A is 
mentioned in the ablative). The Kāśikā says: parasya kāryaṁ śiṣyamāṇam āder alaḥ 
pratyetavyam. kva ca parasya kāryaṁ śiṣyate. yatra pañcamīnirdeśaḥ. ‘An operation taught 
for the following item will apply to the first sound (of the following item). And where (i.e., in 
which cases) is the operation taught for the following sound? Where [an item has been] 
mentioned in the ablative.’ It also gives an example: 6.3.97 dvyantarupasargebhyo ’pa īt ‘the 
substitute īT is taught for [the nominal base] ap ‘water’ when ap is preceded by dvi, antar or 
an upasarga ‘preverb’. Since dvyantarupasargebhyo is taught in the ablative, 1.1.54 mandates 
that īT replaces the first sound of ap i.e., a. In sum, the Kāśikā implies that 1.1.54 does not 
govern rules in which the preceding term is not mentioned in the ablative. 
The Siddhāntakaumudī (SK) mentions the following relationships between these metarules: 
(i) 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya is an exception of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya. Thus 1.1.54 wins against 1.1.52.2 
(ii) 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya is an exception of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya. Thus 1.1.55 wins against 
1.1.52.3 
(iii) 1.1.53 ṅic ca is an exception of 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya. Thus 1.1.53 wins against 1.1.55.4  
(iv) 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya comes after 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya in the serial order of the 
Aṣṭādhyāyī. Thus, by the traditional interpretation of 1.4.2, 1.1.55 wins against 1.1.54.5  
 
2Alo’ntyasya ity asyāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.54). 
3 Alo’ntyasūtrāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.55). 
4 Sarvasya ity asyāpavādaḥ (SK on 1.1.53). 
5 Aṣṭābhya auś (7.1.21) ityādau deḥ parasya ity etad api paratvād anena bādhyate (SK on 1.1.55). 

221 
 
Below, I have represented this information in the form of a diagram. The arrows point towards 
the winning rules. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Let us go back to the rule 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy anyatarasyām. It teaches the substitute 
tātAṄ for tu. The metarules eligible to govern the application of 7.1.35 are 1.1.52, 1.1.53 and 
1.1.55. 1.1.55 is an exception of 1.1.52 and 1.1.53 is an exception of 1.1.55. Thus, 1.1.53 should 
govern the application of 7.1.35, which leads to tātAṄ replacing only the final sound of tu. 
However, this gives the incorrect form *likhattāt. In his only vārttika on 1.1.536, Kātyāyana 
recognizes this problem and says that the operation concerning tātAṄ should not be governed 
by 1.1.53 ṅic ca because here the only purpose of anubandha Ṅ is to block any potential guṇa 
or vr̥ ddhi substitution in the preceding base (cf. 1.1.5 kṅiti ca), rather than facilitate the 
substitution of the last sound (cf. 1.1.53). However, we know that, in Pāṇini’s grammar, if a 
certain item is marked with Ṅ, then it automatically possesses all the properties associated with 
Ṅ-marking, unless Pāṇini has said something to the opposite effect. One cannot arbitrarily 
choose which function of Ṅ is relevant to a particular rule and which function is not. Thus, 
Kātyāyana’s explanation is not acceptable.  
Is there a way to derive the correct form likhatāt without flouting Pāṇini’s metarules? To 
answer this question, let me discuss this problem from my perspective. To begin with, let me

‘useful elsewhere’ [we can infer that] there is a vipratiṣedha ‘conflict’ (between 1.1.55 anekālśit

present my interpretation of 1.1.54 ādeḥ parasya, which is different from that of the tradition. 
I think that there is no evidence in the wording of 1.1.54 or elsewhere to suggest that the 
presence of an ablative form in an operational rule constitutes a necessary condition for the 
application of 1.1.54. So, according to me, 1.1.54 governs any para or right-hand side (RHS) 
operation.  
Let us look at the implications of these two interpretations of 1.1.54. According to the 
traditional interpretation, since an ablative form is not present in 7.1.35 tuhyos tātaṅ āśiṣy 
anyatarasyām, 1.1.54 would not be able to govern it. However, according to my interpretation, 
1.1.54 is eligible to govern 7.1.35 simply because the operand tu is para i.e., placed to the right-
hand side of likha.  
I also disagree with the tradition with respect to the scope of 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya and 1.1.53 ṅic 
ca. According to the tradition, 1.1.53 is applicable to any substitute marked with Ṅ. However, 
I think that, since Pāṇini has specifically taught 1.1.54 for RHS substitutions, he has likely 
taught both 1.1.52 and 1.1.53 only for LHS substitutions. I agree with the tradition on the scope 
of 1.1.55: I think that Pāṇini has taught 1.1.55 for both LHS and RHS substitutions. Let us now 
establish general-exception relationships separately for LHS and RHS substitutions.  
First, let us consider LHS substitutions, which can potentially be governed by 1.1.52, 1.1.53 
and 1.1.55.  
(i) While 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya can govern only those substitutes which contain multiple 
sound segments or are marked with Ś, 1.1.52 alo’ntyasya can govern any substitute. Thus, 
1.1.55 is an exception of 1.1.52.  
(ii) In case of substitutes which are made up of multiple sounds and marked with Ṅ, there arises 
competition between 1.1.53 ṅic ca and 1.1.55 anekālśit sarvasya. I think the only reason behind 
teaching a rule (i.e., 1.1.53) specially dealing with Ṅ-marked substitutes is to suggest that Ṅ-
marked substitutes, despite containing multiple sounds, replace only the final sound of the 
operand, and not the entirety of it. Thus, I think 1.1.53 is an exception of 1.1.55.  
Now let us consider RHS substitutions, which can potentially be governed by 1.1.54 and 1.1.55. 
Since 1.1.55 has been specifically taught for substitutes made up of multiple sounds, it is an 
exception of 1.1.54.  
This information can be diagrammatically represented as follows. The arrows point towards 
the exception / specific rule: 

223 
 
LHS substitution 
RHS substitution 
 
 
 
Thus, we can conclude that 7.1.35, which deals with an RHS substitute, i.e., tātAṄ, cannot be 
governed by 1.1.52 and 1.1.53, which have been taught only for LHS substitutions. The only 
rules that can potentially govern 7.1.35 are 1.1.54 and 1.1.55. Since 1.1.55 has been specifically 
taught for substitutes made up of multiple sounds, it is more specific than 1.1.54. Therefore, 
by 1.1.55, tu is entirely replaced with tātAṄ, giving the correct form likhatāt.

Appendix B1: 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 in the Context of Augmentation 
 
To better understand the interaction between 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya and 1.1.67 
tasmād ity uttarasya, let us look at the operational rule 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) which 
the tradition interprets, based on the two paribhāṣās mentioned above, as follows: the augment 
sUṬ is introduced to affix ām when it occurs after a sarvanāman ‘pronominal base’ ending in 
a. Even though I think this is indeed the correct interpretation, I disagree with the tradition on 
the process through which it arrives at this interpretation. Let us first consider the individual 
parts of this sūtra: 
āmi = locative singular form of ām 
sarvanāmnaḥ (āt) = ablative singular forms of sarvanāman and a respectively  
sUṬ = nominative singular form of sUṬ 
Since Pāṇini has used the locative singular form āmi, 7.1.52 could potentially be governed by 
the metarule 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya which the tradition interprets as follows: if an 
item is mentioned in the operational rule in the locative, then the item to its left undergoes the 
operation.2 Similarly, since Pāṇini has used the ablative forms sarvanāmnaḥ and āt, 7.1.52 
could potentially be governed by the metarule 1.1.67 tasmād ity uttarasya which the tradition 
interprets as follows: if an item is mentioned in the operational rule in the ablative, then the 
item to its right undergoes the operation.3  
In sum, according to the tradition, in x + y, if rule K is applicable, then: 
(i) if y is mentioned in the locative, then, by 1.1.66, x undergoes the operation taught by K. 
(ii) if x is mentioned in the ablative, then by 1.1.67, y undergoes the operation taught by K. 
Consider the derivation of the genitive plural of the pronominal stem sarva ‘everything’4: sarva 
+ ām. Here the pronominal stem sarva ends in a and is followed by ām. So, 7.1.52 āmi 
sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) is applicable. By 1.1.66, the augment sUṬ should be attached to sarva

our focus is on the competition between paribhāṣā rules. Nonetheless, I follow my method of dealing 
with SOI and DOI in this derivation.

but by 1.1.67, the augment sUṬ should be attached to ām. Which of the two metarules should 
be chosen to govern 7.1.52? 
Through his vārttikas on 1.1.67, Kātyāyana offers a solution to this problem. He says that when 
both locative and ablative forms have been used in a rule like 7.1.52, the ablative prevails (vt. 
3: ubhayanirdeśe vipratiṣedhāt pañcamīnirdeśaḥ)5, and the locative should be reinterpreted as 
a genitive (vt. 14: yathārthaṁ vā ṣaṣṭhīnirdeśaḥ)6. Therefore, according to Kātyāyana, 7.1.52 
āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) means āmaḥ sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt): the augment sUṬ is introduced 
to affix ām when it occurs after a sarvanāma ‘pronominal base’ ending in a.  
By 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau (which, according to the tradition, teaches that items marked with 
Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the beginning and end respectively of items 
taught in the genitive7), the augment sUṬ is attached at the beginning of ām. The derivation 
proceeds as follows: sarva + ām  sarva + sām (7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ)  sarve + sām 
(6.1.97 bahuvacane jhaly et)  sarveṣām (8.3.59 ādeśapratyayoḥ). 
But does Kātyāyana’s solution enable us to correctly interpret all of Pāṇini’s operational rules 
which teach augments? No, it fails to help us correctly interpret rules which teach the insertion 
of augments marked with K and contain ablative and / or locative forms e.g., 6.1.75 dīrghāt 
(che tuk), 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), 7.2.82 āne muk (ataḥ) and 8.3.31 śi tuk (naś 
ca). Let us discuss the rule 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk). In order to correctly interpret 
this rule, let us first analyse its parts. che is a locative form, and dīrghāt and padāntāt are both 
ablative forms. Since Pāṇini has used the locative form che, 6.1.76 could potentially be 
governed by the metarule 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya, but since Pāṇini has used the 
ablative forms dīrghāt and padāntāt, 6.1.76 could also be governed by the metarule 1.1.67 
tasmād ity uttarasya.  
Consider the compound kuṭīcchāyā ‘shade of a hut’. When deriving this form, at step kuṭī + 
chāyā, since kuṭī ends in a long vowel and since chāyā begins with a ch, 6.1.76 is applicable.  
By 1.1.66, the augment tUK should be attached to kuṭī but by 1.1.67, the augment tUK should 
be attached to chāyā. Which of the two metarules should be chosen to govern 6.1.76? By 
vārttikas 3 and 14, when there is a competition between the ablative and the locative, the 
 
5 Mbh I.173.1. 
6 Mbh I.174.6. 
7 On 1.1.46, the Kāśikā says: ādiḥ ṭit bhavati antaḥ kit bhavati ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya. 

226 
 
ablative prevails and the locative is reinterpreted as a genitive. Thus, according to the 
aforementioned vārttikas, 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk) means: padāntād vā dīrghāt 
chaḥ tuk ‘the augment tUK is optionally introduced to the item beginning with cha when it is 
preceded by a pada ending in a long vowel’. By 1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau, the augment tUK is 
attached at the end of chāyā. However, this gives the incorrect form: *kuṭīchāyāt. To get the 
correct form, we need to attach the augment tUK at the end of kuṭī: kuṭī-t-chāyā  kuṭīcchāyā 
(8.4.40 stoś ścunā ścuḥ). This shows that Kātyāyana’s vārttikas cannot help us correctly 
interpret augment-insertion rules like 6.1.76.  
Let me now expound on how I tackle this problem. In my opinion, Kātyāyana’s interpretation 
of the metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 is not correct. Kātyāyana interprets pūrvasya and uttarasya 
in 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 as ‘in the place of the LHS item’ and ‘in the place of the RHS item’ 
respectively. In my opinion, this is not warranted. I think that that we can infer ‘in the place of 
X’ only when X has been mentioned (or continued by anuvr̥ tti) in the genitive in the operational 
rule (cf. 1.1.49 ṣaṣṭhī sthāneyogā, which teaches that a genitive ending, which is not otherwise 
interpretable in its context, signifies the relation ‘in the place of’). Let me explain what I mean 
by this through examples. In 6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci, iK is mentioned in the genitive and aC in the 
locative. Thus, by 1.1.49 ṣaṣṭhī sthāneyogā and 1.1.66 tasminn iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya 
respectively, we can interpret 6.1.77 as: 
iK       +       aC 
 
                                                              6.1.77 
However, notice that in 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), Pāṇini has not used a genitive 
form, so we cannot interpret it as: 
padānta dīrgha         +       cha 
 
                                                                 6.1.76 
I interpret pūrvasya in 1.1.66 merely as an indication of the left-hand side and similarly 
uttarasya in 1.1.67 merely as an indication of the right-hand side. The best way to offer clarity 
on this is to summarize the difference between the traditional and my interpretations of 1.1.66 
and 1.1.67 with diagrams. In the table below, I have stated the case in which the word is 
mentioned in the operational rule in round brackets:

                     K 
 
Let me now explain how I interpret the operational rules 7.1.52 āmi sarvanāmnaḥ suṭ (āt) and 
6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk), based on my interpretations of 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 
respectively. Let us start with 7.1.52.  
According to me, there is no competition between metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67. In fact, I think 
that both 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 are required to interpret 7.1.52:  
(a) 1.1.66 tells us that the augment sUṬ should be placed to the left of affix ām. 
               sUṬ      ām 
(b) 1.1.67 tells us that the augment sUṬ should be placed to the right of sarvanāman ‘the 
pronominal base’.  
                                                           sarva      sUṬ 
Now, if we put together the teachings of metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we get: 
sarva      sUṬ       ām 
Before we continue, note that there is a difference between Kāśikā’s and my interpretation of 
1.1.46 ādyantau ṭakitau. Kāśikā’s interpretation is: ādiḥ ṭit bhavati antaḥ kit bhavati 
ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya ‘items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the 
beginning and end respectively of items taught in the genitive.’ I do not think that we should 
take the liberty to read ṣaṣṭhīnirdiṣṭasya ‘taught in the genitive’ into this rule. I think 1.1.46 
simply means ‘items marked with Ṭ and items marked with K should be attached to the 
beginning and end respectively’. Coming back to 7.1.52, we have: 
sarva      sUṬ       ām 
sUṬ lies between the end of sarva and the beginning of ām. By my interpretation of 1.1.46 
ādyantau ṭakitau, sUṬ should be attached to the beginning of an item. Thus, it is attached to 

228 
 
(the beginning of) ām. We get: sarva + sām which, as seen above, leads to the correct form 
sarveṣām. 
Now let us interpret 6.1.76 padāntād vā (dīrghāt che tuk) using my interpretation of 1.1.66 and 
1.1.67. As stated above, I do not think that there is any competition between 1.1.66 and 1.1.67. 
In fact, I think that both 1.1.66 and 1.1.67 are required to interpret 6.1.76. 
(a) 1.1.66 tells us that the augment tUK should be placed to the left of ch. 
tUK       chāyā 
(b) 1.1.67 tells us that the augment tUK should be placed to the right of the long vowel. 
                                                  kuṭī      tUK 
Now, if we put together the teachings of metarules 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we get: 
                                                kuṭī        tUK        chāyā 
tUK lies between the end of kuṭī and the beginning of chāyā. By my interpretation of 1.1.46 
ādyantau ṭakitau, tUK should be attached to the end of an item. Thus, it is attached to (the end 
of) kuṭī. We get kuṭīt + chāyā which, as seen above, leads to the correct form kuṭīcchāyā. 
I have shown that, using my interpretation of 1.1.46, 1.1.66 and 1.1.67, we can correctly 
interpret Pāṇini’s operational rules which teach the insertion of augments marked with Ṭ or K 
using ablative and locative forms. Kātyāyana’s vārttikas, on the other hand, are not able to 
accomplish the same.

Appendix C: ‘Conflicts’ Between Antaraṅga and Bahiraṅga Rules 
In this appendix, I will discuss some traditional examples of ‘conflict’ between antaraṅga and 
bahiraṅga rules, and present my opinion on them. Before we begin, let us revise the basic 
definition of antaraṅga. According to the Paribhāṣenduśekhara1, ‘antaraṅga is (a rule) the 
causes (of the application) of which lie within (or before) the sum of the causes of a bahiraṅga 
rule’.2 An antaraṅga rule is stronger than and thus defeats a bahiraṅga rule.3  
However, note that Kātyāyana and Patañjali, despite talking about antaraṅga and bahiraṅga, 
do not define these terms and consequently do not explain why a certain rule is to be regarded 
as antaraṅga.  In vt. 8 on 1.4.2 vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam, Kātyāyana says: antaraṅgam ca. 
On this vārttika, Patañjali elaborates: antaraṅgam ca balīyo bhavatīti vaktavyam ‘It should also 
be said that [an] antaraṅga [rule] is stronger [than a bahiraṅga rule]’. Let us examine some 
examples discussed by Patañjali (Mbh I.304.10 onwards) while commenting on various 
vārttikas on 1.4.2.  
 
(1) Let us follow Patañjali’s method to derive syona ‘a stitched item i.e., a sack’. First, we add 
na to siv ‘to stitch’ by 3.3.1 uṇādayo bahulam.4 By 6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca (which 
teaches that ch and v are replaced with ś and ūṬH, respectively, when an affix beginning with 
a nasal, or affix KvI, or one beginning with jhaL i.e., a non-nasal stop or a fricative, and marked 
with K or Ṅ, follows), we get siū + na. According to Patañjali, two rules are simultaneously 
applicable to siū + na: 
s       i      ū          +         na 
 
                                       6.1.77                        7.3.86 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: iK (i, u, r̥ , l̥ ) is replaced with yaṆ (y, v, r, l) when aC (any vowel) follows. 
 
1 See Pbh 50 in Abhyankar’s reprint (1960: 221-222) of Kielhorn’s translation of the 
Paribhāṣenduśekhara. 
2 The Sanskrit text is as follows: antarmadhye bahiraṅgaśāstrīyanimittasamudāyamadhye ’ntarbhūtāny 
aṅgāni nimittāni yasya tad antaraṅgam. evaṁ tadīyanimittasamudāyād bahirbhūtāṅgakaṁ bahiraṅgam. 
See the first two lines under Pbh 50 in Paribhāṣenduśekhara edited by Abhyankar (1962: 76). 
3 Antaraṅgabahiraṅgayor antaraṅgo vidhir balīyān (Pbh 115, Vyāḍiparibhāṣāpāṭha). 
4 The specific Uṇādisūtra teaching this is 289 siveṣ ṭer yū ca. 

230 
 
7.3.86 pugantalaghūpadhasya ca: guṇa replaces iK of a verbal base which ends in the augment 
pUK or which has a laghu ‘light’ vowel as its penultimate sound when a sārvadhātuka or 
ārdhadhātuka affix follows. 
According to Patañjali, the rule teaching substitution with yaṆ (6.1.77) is antaraṅga with 
respect to the rule teaching guṇa (7.3.86). This is corroborated by the definition of antaraṅga 
given by the commentary on Pbh 50 of the Paribhāṣenduśekhara: the cause of application of 
6.1.77 (i.e., ū) lies before i.e., to the left of the cause of application of 7.3.86 (i.e., na). Let us 
use this example to speculate about how Kātyāyana might have defined antaraṅga and 
bahiraṅga. Note that the cause of application of 6.1.77 lies inside (antar) the aṅga siū, while 
the cause of application of 7.3.86 lies outside (bahir) it. Thus, the term antaraṅga could stand 
for aṅgasya antaḥ and the term bahiraṅga for aṅgād bahiḥ. 
The antaraṅga rule 6.1.77 wins, and thus the derivation proceeds as follows: siū + na  syū 
+ na (6.1.77)  syona (7.3.84 sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ). 
Now let me present my opinion about this example. There is no evidence that Pāṇini has 
composed the Uṇādi sūtras. Therefore, this derivation, which requires us to add na to siv as 
per an Uṇādisūtra (289) is not Pāṇinian at all. 
 
(2) Let us use Patañjali’s method to derive the form dyaukāmi ‘male offspring of dyukāma’. 
We start by adding the taddhita affix iÑ to the bahuvrīhi compound made up of div and kāma 
by 4.1.95 ata iÑ (which teaches that the taddhita affix iÑ occurs to denote an offspring after a 
syntactically related nominal stem which ends in a). After deleting the inflectional affixes 
inside the compound by 2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ, we get div + kāma + iÑ. Here, by 
6.1.131 diva ut (which teaches that the final sound of the pada div is replaced with uT), we get 
diu + kāma + iÑ. At this stage, according to Patañjali, two rules are simultaneously applicable: 
d         i        u         +      kāma        +         iÑ 
 
                                    6.1.77           7.2.117 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci: same as above. 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: the first vowel of the base undergoes vr̥ ddhi when an affix 
marked with Ñ or Ṇ follows in taddhita derivations. 

231 
 
This example is similar to the previous one: the cause of application of 6.1.77 (i.e., u) lies 
before, namely to the left of the cause of application of 7.2.117 (i.e., iÑ). Here too, Patañjali 
says that 6.1.77 is antaraṅga and thus wins. The derivation proceeds as follows: diu + kāma + 
iÑ  dyu + kāma + iÑ (6.1.77)  dyau + kāma + iÑ (7.2.117)  dyaukāmi (6.4.148 yasyeti 
ca5).  
In my opinion, no such conflict arises in the first place. We want to derive a word that means: 
dyukāmasya apatyam pumān ‘male offspring of dyukāma’. Since we are talking about 
dyukāma’s offspring, and not (div + kāma)’s offspring, the derivation should start with 
dyukāma and not with div + kāma. Thus, we have: dyukāma + Ṅas + iÑ. Ṅas is deleted by 
2.4.71 supo dhātuprātipadikayoḥ and we get dyukāma + iÑ. Here two rules are simultaneously 
applicable: 
                                                dyukāma    +      iÑ 
 
                                          7.2.117      6.4.148 
7.2.117 taddhiteṣv acām ādeḥ: same as above. 
6.4.148 yasyeti ca: same as above. 
This is a case of DOI. By my interpretation of 1.4.2, we apply the RHS rule 6.4.148 and get 
dyukām + iÑ. Then we apply 7.2.117 and get dyaukāmi, which is the correct form. 6 
Several other examples discussed by Patañjali in his comments on different vārttikas on 1.4.2, 
such as sautthatiḥ, kādraveyaḥ, stairṇiḥ, khaṭvīyati, kāmaṇḍaleya, cauḍi etc. are similar to this 
example. For instance, in the derivation of the nominal base sautthati, Patañjali starts with su 
+ utthita, whereas one should actually start with sūtthita. 
   
(3) Let us follow Patañjali’s method to derive the form dudyūṣati ‘desires to shine’. We start 
by adding the desiderative affix saN to the root div ‘to shine’ by 3.1.7 dhātoḥ karmaṇaḥ 
samānakartr̥ kād icchāyāṁ vā (which teaches that the affix saN is optionally introduced after a 
verbal stem, the action denoted by which is the object of a verbal stem expressing desire and 
both actions have the same agent). Thereafter, by 6.4.19 chvoḥ śūḍ anunāsike ca (see 
 
5 The final i or a of a bha item is replaced with LOPA when it is followed by ī or a taddhita affix. 
6 Note that I have not added the nominative singular affix here for the purpose of brevity.  

232 
 
translation in example 1), we get diū + saN. Here, according to Patañjali, two rules are 
simultaneously applicable: 
{d        [i] }       ū         +         saN 
6.1.77 iko yaṇ aci is applicable to i while 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ7 is applicable to di. Notice that the 
cause of application of 6.1.77 (i.e., ū) lies to the left of the cause of application of 6.1.9 (i.e., 
saN). Patañjali says that 6.1.77 is antaraṅga and thus wins, thereby giving: dyū + saN. 
Thereafter, 6.1.9 applies and we get dyūdyū + saN. After applying other rules, we get the 
correct form dudyūṣati. 
In my opinion, such a conflict does not arise in the first place. I interpret sanyaṅoḥ as a genitive 
form, not as a locative form8. So, in my view, 6.1.9 sanyaṅoḥ teaches that a verbal base ending 
in saN or yaṄ, which has not undergone reduplication, is reduplicated9. Note that diū + saN is 
not a verbal base ending in saN, but instead two separate items, namely diū and saN. So, 6.1.9 
is not applicable here. However, 6.1.77 is applicable here, and on applying it, we get dyū + 
saN. Now, since no other rules can be applied here, we can fuse the two items dyū and saN into 
a single item dyūṣa, which we can call a verbal base ending in saN. Therefore, 6.1.9 applies 
here and we get dyūdyūṣa. After applying other rules, we get the correct verbal base dudyūṣa 
(and the correct final form dudyūṣati).  
The examples jujñaudanīyiṣati and ātestīryate discussed by Patañjali are similar to this one.  
 
(4) Patañjali says that in the string ayaja + i + indram ‘I worshipped Indra’, two rules are 
simultaneously applicable: 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, which is applicable to a + i and 6.1.101 akaḥ 
savarṇe dīrghaḥ, which is applicable to i + i. He adds that 6.1.87 is antaraṅga and thus win, 
thereby giving the correct form: ayaje indram.  
 
7 If we interpret sanyaṅoḥ as locative, as I think Patañjali does in this case, then this rule teaches that a 
verbal base which has not undergone reduplication is reduplicated when followed by saN or yaṄ. Note 
that, the whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 ekāco 
dve prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 
8 If we interpret it as locative, it is not possible to derive the form aṭiṭiṣati (Cardona 1997: xviii). Thus, 
we must interpret it as a genitive. 
9 The whole base does not undergo reduplication. Instead, only one syllable does. See 6.1.1 ekāco dve 
prathamasya and 6.1.2 ajāder dvitīyasya. 

233 
 
I do not think that such a conflict arises at all. I think that, in the Pāṇinian system, all possible 
rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the word is 
considered within the context of the sentence. In other words, these rules, which contribute 
towards the construction of a word, cannot be applied after the word enters the sentence. Here, 
the rule 6.1.87 applies to ayaja + i, giving the form ayaje. Now that the word is ready, it enters 
the sentence: ayaje indram10. 
Other examples of this nature discussed by Patañjali include agnir indraḥ, pacatv atra.  
 
(5) Let us derive the form vānīya ‘should be weaved’ using Patañjali’s method. We add the 
affix anīyaR to veÑ ‘to weave’ by 3.1.96 tavyattavyānīyaraḥ. Here, according to Patañjali, two 
rules are simultaneously applicable: 
ve         +       anīyaR 
 
                                             6.1.78           6.1.45 
6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ: the sounds represented by eC (e, o, ai, and au) are replaced with ay, av, 
āy, and āv, respectively, when a vowel follows. 
6.1.45 ād eca upadeśe’śiti: the final sound of a verbal root which ends in eC (e, o, ai, and au) 
in the Dhātupāṭha is replaced with ā, when an affix which is not marked with Ś follows. 
Patañjali says that 6.1.45 is antaraṅga with respect to 6.1.78 and thus wins. Note that this 
contradicts what the commentary on Pbh 50 tells us. We would expect the cause of application 
of the antaraṅga rule to be within or before that of the bahiraṅga rule. But here, the cause of 
application of the bahiraṅga rule 6.1.78 (i.e., a at the beginning of anīyaR) lies inside the cause 
of the antaraṅga rule 6.1.45 (i.e., anīyaR). This exemplifies the fact that the antaraṅga tool is 
poorly defined and not always useful. 
According to me, this is a case of SOI, and we do not need the antaraṅga tool to deal with 
cases of SOI. In case of SOI, the more specific rule wins. Let us compare the two rules: 
 
 
10 Here, the following operations take place: ayaje indram  ayajay indram (6.1.78 eco’yavāyāvaḥ)  
ayaja indram (8.3.19 lopaḥ śākalyasya).  

234 
 
6.1.78  
e / o / ai / au + vowel 
6.1.45 
e / o / ai / au (end of verbal root) + vowel (beginning of affix not marked with Ś) 
e / o / ai / au (end of verbal root) + non-vowel (beginning of affix not marked with Ś) 
6.1.45 is more specific because it applies only when the affix is not marked with Ś. Thus, it 
wins, giving us the correct form vā + anīya  vānīya (6.1.101 akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ). 
Other examples discussed by Patañjali such as glācchatram, agnicid idam are similar to this 
one.  
Finally, Patañjali does not simply say that antaraṅga rules defeat bahiraṅga rules in case of 
conflict. He goes a step further to claim: asiddhaṁ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge ‘a bahiraṅga rule is 
asiddha with respect to an antaraṅga rule’. Thus, he implies that an antaraṅga rule cannot see 
a bahiraṅga rule, and therefore cannot see the outcome of the application of the bahiraṅga rule 
either. This is true not only for cases of Same Step Rule Interaction (including conflict) but 
also for any pair of antaraṅga-bahiraṅga rules which are not simultaneously applicable. 
Consider the following example. 
 
(6) Consider pacāva + idam. By 6.1.87 ād guṇaḥ, we get pacāvedam. Here, Patañjali claims 
that by 3.4.93 eta ai (which teaches that eT, which is a substitute of the first-person replacement 
of LOṬ, is replaced with ai), the e in pacāvedam could get replaced with ai, thereby giving the 
incorrect phrase *pacāvaidam. He says that this is prevented by the fact that the rule 6.1.87 is 
bahiraṅga and thus asiddha with respect to the antaraṅga rule 3.4.93. Thus, 3.4.93 cannot 
apply to e, which is the outcome of the application of 6.1.87. This ensures that we get the 
correct phrase: pacāvedam. 
I do not agree with Patañjali. As stated before, according to me, in the Pāṇinian system all 
possible rules that can be applied while constructing a word ought to be applied before the 
word is considered within the context of the sentence. In other words, these rules, which 
contribute towards the construction of a word, cannot be applied to the word after it enters the 
sentence. Note that, 3.4.93 eta ai is a rule which helps the construction of a word (e.g., 
edhāvahai) and, therefore, it is not applicable at sentence level.  

235 
 
In conclusion, I think that the antaraṅga tool is completely unnecessary in both SSRI and non-
SSRI contexts. Most examples (like 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) which it allegedly solves are not 
problematic in the first place. Some examples (like 5) it deals with are actually ordinary cases 
of SOI which can be solved by choosing the more specific rule.

Appendix E: Some Thoughts on the Siddha Principle 
Let us begin by looking at the fundamental justification given by Joshi and Kiparsky (1979) 
for their siddha principle and will present my ideas on the same. In ‘The Ordering of Rules in 
Pāṇini’s Grammar’ (1982), Kiparsky gives a detailed explanation of the siddha principle. I will 
quote from this paper here. 
Kiparsky proposes the siddha principle on the basis of a vārttika on 6.1.86 ṣatvatukor asiddhaḥ 
‘a single replacement in place of the preceding and the following sound segments is suspended1 
with respect to any potential replacement with ṣ or insertion of augment tUK’. Kiparsky 
explains: “Kātyāyana says that making a rule asiddha has two functions: (ṣatvatukor)2 
asiddhavacanam ādeśalakṣaṇapratiṣedhārtham utsargalakṣaṇabhāvārthaṁ ca (6.1.86, vt. 1). 
Utsarga here means sthānin, the element which undergoes substitution in a rule.”3  
I translate this vārttika as follows: ‘the statement that ṣ [replacing s] and [the insertion of the 
augment] tUK are asiddha [has been made] for the purpose of preventing the operations that 
are due for application to the substitute, and facilitating the operations that are due for 
application to the substituendum (original item)’.  
Kiparsky then says: “to use terms common in linguistics, asiddhatva blocks bleeding and 
feeding between rules.” Before going further, let us understand what he means by feeding and 
bleeding: A feeds B if the application of A facilitates the application of B, and P bleeds Q if 
the application of P obstructs the application of Q.  
Kiparsky concludes: “it can be said that asiddha and the other devices are restrictions (niyamas) 
on a general paribhāṣā that determines how rules interact when no special statement about their 
ordering is made in the grammar. This paribhāṣā is not stated in the grammar itself but it is 
presupposed by the correct operation of rules in it and implied by the various restrictions on it 
that are stated in the grammar. It is to be formulated as ‘sarvatra siddham’ and we refer to it 
as the siddha principle.”4 He continues: “[W]hat the siddha principle says is that in the general 
case we have ādeśalakṣaṇabhāva and utsargalakṣaṇapratiṣedha…in short, the siddha relations 
 
1 When A is suspended with respect to B, B cannot acknowledge A. 
2 The vārttika (Mbh III.65.9) has the word ṣatvatukor in it, but when Kiparsky quotes the vārttika, he 
excludes this word from it. 
3 Kiparsky 1982: 77. 
4 Ibid., 79. 

239 
 
of bleeding and feeding are given free by the underlying theory of the Aṣṭādhyāyī and if we 
must not have them in some particular case, then only something must be said in the grammar 
itself.”5 
Further, he says, “As far as feeding is concerned, this really goes without saying. In almost any 
derivation, the application of one rule creates scope for another rule to apply, that rule applies 
creating scope for a third rule and so on. That all rules in such a chain of rules are to be applied 
is taken for granted in the tradition.”6 He adds, “By this point anyone familiar with the topic 
will already have recognized that the principle of bleeding order is simply equivalent to the 
nitya-principle in the traditional inventory of the paribhāṣās.”7 
Thus, we can say feeding and bleeding together are simply equivalent to nityatva in the 
Pāṇinian tradition. And the siddha principle, which means the maximization of feeding and 
bleeding, is tantamount to the maximization, wherever possible, of the use of nityatva for rule 
conflict resolution, that is, in all cases involving unidirectional blocking.

7 Ibid., 84-85. 

240 
 
Now, using diagrams, I will explain why I think Joshi and Kiparsky have made a logical error 
in interpreting the aforementioned vārttika. I will focus on bleeding and not on feeding, because 
as Kiparsky himself says, what he calls ‘feeding’ is built into the Pāṇinian system, and there is 
no controversy about it. 
What Kātyāyana’s vārttika implies: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kiparsky takes the liberty to interpret this as: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                               
A  
(asiddha = does not allow 
any recognition of the 
suspended i.e., asiddha 
rules and as a result 
bleeding can never take 
place 
A’ 
(siddha = allows 
recognition of all rules 
and as a result bleeding 
can potentially take 
place. It may or may not 
take place) 
                  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A  
(asiddha = bleeding 
never takes place) 
A’  
(siddha = bleeding 
always takes 
place) 

241 
 
Let us use an analogy to understand this, just like Patañjali often does. Imagine that a young 
boy, who is obedient to his parents, can be given one of two possible instructions by his parents 
about going near the fire:  
Parental instruction 
What this instruction actually 
entails 
What Kiparsky assumes it 
entails 
You are not allowed to 
go near the fire. (These 
rules are asiddha.) 
The child will never burn his 
hand. (Bleeding will never take 
place). 
The child will never burn his 
hand. (Bleeding will never take 
place). 
You are allowed to go 
near the fire. 
(These rules are siddha.) 
The child can potentially burn his 
hand. He may or may not burn his 
hand. (Bleeding can potentially 
take place. It may or may not take 
place.) 
The child will always burn his 
hand. (Bleeding will always 
take place). 
 
I conclude that it is not logically possible to infer the siddha principle from vt. 1 on 6.1.86.  
Regardless of that, let me briefly comment on the following question: how useful is the siddha 
principle in dealing with cases of SSRI? As stated in chapter 6, the siddha principle rejects the 
antaraṅga tool and essentially resorts to the nitya tool to solve not only those cases which the 
tradition solves using nityatva, but also those which it solves using antaraṅgatva. Of course, 
this means that the siddha principle is able to tackle cases of unidirectional blocking but not of 
mutual blocking – which is one of its drawbacks.8 Another drawback of the siddha principle is 
that it pays little attention to and offers no solutions for those cases of SSRI which do not 
involve any blocking at all (‘non-conflict’). 
How useful is the siddha principle in dealing with cases of unidirectional blocking? Since the 
siddha principle is no different from the nitya principle, albeit with a wider scope of application 
than the traditional one, the answer to this question is the same as the answer to the question 
about the potency of the nitya principle, which I have given in footnote 62 of chapter 4, and 
which I reproduce here: “This is exactly why the traditional nitya tool which teaches that the 
nitya rule defeats the anitya rule, always correctly resolves cases of DOI involving 
 
8 As stated towards the end of section 6.2 in chapter 6, Joshi and Kiparsky admit that, for mutual 
blocking, “no general solution has been found” (Kiparsky 1987: 295) by them. 

242 
 
unidirectional blocking: the nitya rule is applicable to the RHS operand and the anitya rule to 
the LHS operand. By (my interpretation of) 1.4.2, the RHS rule (which is also the nitya rule) 
defeats the LHS rule (which is the anitya rule).” However, I do not know if the nitya / siddha 
principle is always correctly able to solve cases of SOI involving unidirectional blocking. A 
majority of the examples discussed in Kiparsky (1982) involve DOI and not SOI. 
A major shortcoming of the nitya, and therefore the siddha principle, is its propensity to look 
ahead into the derivation: one needs to know what will happen at the next step if, hypothetically 
speaking, a certain rule is applied at the present step. I think this very much qualifies as ‘looking 
ahead’, even though it involves considering merely the potential – and not the actual – future 
course of the derivation. Joshi and Kiparsky (2005) take this a step further by proposing the 
extended siddha principle which ‘scans entire candidate derivations…’9 thanks to its ‘global 
(trans-derivational) “lookahead” condition on derivations’10 ‘…and chooses the one in which 
siddha-relations (i.e., bleeding and feeding)11 are maximized’12.13 In simple words, they ask us 
to choose, from amongst all possible derivational paths, that derivational path in which the 
nitya tool has been applied the highest number of times.  
Why does the derivational path in which siddha relations are maximized lead to the correct 
answer though? It is easy to explain this with respect to DOI. In case of DOI, Pāṇini teaches us 
(according to my interpretation of 1.4.2) that we must pick the RHS rule. But as we know (see 
the footnoted reproduced above), it is the RHS rule which is also the nitya rule in cases of DOI 
involving unidirectional blocking. So, it is natural that, of all the possible derivational paths, 
the correct one has the highest number of instances in which the nitya (RHS rule) defeats the 
anitya (LHS) rule – in cases of DOI involving unidirectional blocking. It is difficult to verify 
if Joshi and Kiparsky’s extended-siddha principle holds true with respect to SOI. 
Now let us ask: how useful is the extended siddha principle in resolving cases of SSRI? If one 
has to chart out all possible derivational paths to make a decision, how is choosing the 
derivational path in which siddha-relations are maximized any better than simply choosing the 
derivational path which gives the correct grammatical form – which we know thanks to our

knowledge of Sanskrit? And in the latter case, why perform derivations at all if we have to rely 
on the correct final form to choose the correct derivational path?  
Joshi and Kiparsky have discussed several examples in the aforementioned papers, a number 
of which I have solved using my method in this thesis. Please see Appendix D for relevant 
tables of concordance. While it is not within the scope of this thesis to discuss in detail Joshi 
and Kiparsky’s solutions for individual examples, we ought to study the work produced by 
them in greater depth in the future to gain new insights into the functioning of Pāṇini’s 
grammar.
