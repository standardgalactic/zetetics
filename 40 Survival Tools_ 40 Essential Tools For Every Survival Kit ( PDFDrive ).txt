Introduction

Like it or not, disasters happen, and they
do not discriminate between gender,
race, age or religion. It does not matter
where you live, what you look like, what
you drive or how much money you have-
no one is exempt from the threat of
natural disaster. Disasters strike
suddenly and give little or no warning.
In those critical moments, nothing else
matters except life itself. You have to
leave your home immediately or you and
your family will die!
Today, highly visible media coverage of
numerous natural and man-made
disasters has heightened the senses of the
inner survivalist in all of us. History
repeatedly shows that city, state, and
federal emergency structures, however

well intended, are not able to effectively
cope with large-scale disasters. Normal
operating procedures and public safety
crumble under the overwhelming chaos
that follows a disaster. To stay alive in a
disaster, the best decision may be to
leave. The buzz term for this decision is
bugging out with BOB.

Chapter 1: Meet BOB – The
Bug Out Bag

Bugging out: Defined


BOB and Necessary Kits
The term bugging out means the decision
to abandon your home or apartment due
to an unexpected emergency situation-
whether caused by man or a natural
disaster. We cannot control or manage
when, where, or how disasters strike.
But we can control and manage how
prepared we are to deal with a disaster.
A 72- hour Emergency Kit packed with
survival tools is a priceless resource in
any Bug Out situation.  This Bug Out
Bag, is a crucial resource in your
overall Bug Out Plan and may very well
be your key to your survival.

Compartmentalized BOB
Key attributes of a bug out bag
A 72-Hour Kit: Your BOB should be

designed to sustain you and your
family members for 72 hours. In the
right hands, a BOB will provide the
necessary 
resources 
to 
survive
longer than just 72 hours.
Manageable and Comfortable: When
disaster strikes, you don’t know if
you will have access to vehicles.
For this reason, Your BOB needs to
be manageable and comfortable.
Your backpack should be designed
to distribute weight evenly and
allow your hands to be free for other
tasks.
Durable Construction: Your bag
needs to be built and designed to
take abuse.

Compartmentalized: Choose a BOB
that has defined compartments. It
will help you to easily organize gear
and 
facilitate 
quick 
access 
to
important items.
Water Resistant: Wet clothing, gear,
and bedding can be fatal in certain
conditions and downright miserable
in all conditions. Choose a pack
made from water-resistant material.
Lining your bag with a construction-
grade trash bag act as an added layer
of water-proof security.
Stocking your pack
There are basically twelve supply

categories that need to be considered
when stocking your Bug Out Bag. They
are:
Water and hydration
Food and cooking
Clothing
Safe shelter and bedding
Fire
First aid kit
Hygiene
Tools
Lighting
Communications
Protecting gear and self-defense
Miscellaneous items


Chapter 2: Water &
Hydration
When you are trying to survive in the
wild, remember three rules
Rule 1: In extreme conditions, you can
live for three hours without shelter
Rule 2: You can live three days without
water
Rule 3: You can live three weeks
without any food
The average adult needs at least 1 liter
of water daily for proper hydration. A
Bug Our Bag or BOB is a 72-hour kit;

you should pack a minimum of 3 liters of
fresh drinking water per person.
Containers
Carry 3 titers of water in different
containers because if you have one
container and you break or lose it, you
no longer have a viable way to carry and
store water.
Divide your water into the following
three different containers
32-oz. Wide-Mouth Nalgene Hard
Bottle: These water bottles are
easier to fill, durable and crush

resistant.
 
Metal Water Bottle: Metal water
bottle gives you the added
advantages of boil and purifies
water collected “in the field”.
 
Collapsible Soft Bottle: Collapsible
soft bottle container allows you to
reduce weight as you go. Use this
container first and when empty, they
take up virtually no space and
weight only a few ounces.

Water purification on the go

Katadyn MyBottle Purifier
Three liters of water won’t last for long.
Following are some ways you can purify
water on the go.
Boiling water: You don’t need any
fancy equipment for boiling water
and it’s 100% effective in killing
harmful, viruses, bacteria and cysts. 
The disadvantages are: boiling
water requires fuel source, weather
can interfere and takes time.
 
Hand Pump Filter System: A hand
pump water filter is one of the
popular water filter system. It can
filter up to one liter of water per

minute. The disadvantage is it pricy
and most do not remove viruses.
Integrated Bottle Filters

Integrated Bottle Filters: You can
use an integrated bottle and filtering
system. This combo unit allows you
to collect unpurified water and then
drink out purified water through a
built in chemical and filter treatment
system inside the bottle itself.
 

Chemical Treatment Tablets:
Chemical treatment tablets are
cheap, take up almost zero space in
a BOB and readily available. One
tablet is usually enough to treat one
liter of water. The purification

process can take anywhere from 30
minutes to 4 hours.
Chapter 3: Food & Food
Preparation
Bug out survival food
Your bug out survival food should have
the following characteristics:
Open and Eat: The best types of
BOB foods are packaged meals that
can be opened and consumed with
little or no preparation.

Long Shelf Life: Choose foods with
long shelf life, up to six months.
Lightweight: Your BOB food need to
be light-weight and packable.
Carbs+ Calories: Choose foods that
are high in carbohydrates and
calories. Dried grains, cereals,
pasta and rice are all very rich in
carbohydrates. Dried meat and nuts
are two great high-calorie BOB
food.
Specific Suggested Bob Foods

MRE or Meals Ready to Eat:
Soldiers are issued MREs while they

are 
in 
the 
field. 
MREs 
are
completely self-contained meal kits.
They usually contain an entrée,
condiment pack, a large cracker, a
dessert 
and 
a 
water-actuated
chemical heat source. These meal
kits are very reliable and nutritious
BOB food source, typically 1000+
calories 
per 
meal. 
MREs 
are
Government Issue and commercially
not available. You can still find them
at gun shows and Army/ Navy
surplus stores, but they are usually
overpriced. A better option is to buy
“civilian” MREs, which are made by
the same manufactures that produce
military MREs.  
List of reputable companies who sell

MREs:
MRESTAR
 MREdepot.com
AmeriQual (US Military MRE
Contractor)

Dehydrated Camping Meals/ Noodle

Meals: Most outdoor retailers sell
dehydrated 
camping 
meals
specifically 
designed 
for
backpacking 
enthusiasts. 
These
meals are readily available on-line.
Unlike MREs, they typically just
contain one main entrée. These
meals are dehydrated, and need to be
cooked before consuming. You will
need a stable heat source to prepare
these meals.

Bars: Granola bars, candy bars and

energy bars are the most practical
eat-on-the-go mini-meals available.
Bars are packed with carbohydrates
and sugars and perfect for a short-
term Bug Out.
Other food items: There are five
other food items that make good
BOB food ration addition:
Instant oatmeal
Whole-grain rice
Beef jerky
Soft tuna packets
Nuts
Food Preparation
You may or may not have access to a

stove-top or an oven where you are
going, so try to stick with something
simple. 
Good 
preparation 
should
involve a safe campfire, some kind of
simple dehydration or a flameless
heating element.
Cooking kits

Choose a cooking kit that you can fit in
your BOB bag. This will give you more
cooking options, increase the safety of
your food and act as a heat source. You

only need a single small pot and a single
small pan to cook. A good cooking kit
includes all of these elements, along
with basic utensils and should come
with a small multipurpose cup.
Infant supplies
If you have a toddler, don’t forget to
pack enough formula and diapers to last
for three days. Plan accordingly and
make sure that you pack enough extra
water to make formula mixture. Since a
toddler can’t be expected to carry their
own BOB bag, you’ll be responsible for
carrying the supplies.


Chapter 4: Clothing for Stay
Warm and Dry
Climate Considerations

There is no right clothing list for a BOB,

and climate determines your clothing.
However, there are good suggestions for
every climate area. Tropical areas
require good quality t-shirts, pants and
shoes. A jacket or windbreaker can help
you to avoid sunburn and keep you warm
at night. Colder areas will require a
heavy jacket, gloves and multiple layers.
Wear multiple shirts in cold areas; this
will cut down your need to have more
cloth in your bag. No matter where you
are, water proofing is always a good
idea.
Clothing Essentials
Your underwear and socks are two most
important clothing items. These items
will help keep away some of the more

problematic conditions that you might
experience while travelling. Pack one
pair of underwear for two days and one
pair of underwear for an equal amount of
time. Beyond this, you should consider
good quality pants and shirts, made from
lightweight poly-cotton fabric coated
with Teflon.
Make sure your clothes have lots of
pockets for all your personal items
including a knife pocket. The belt hoops
should be tough enough for a thick belt to
carry a sidearm. Pack at least two long-
sleeve shirts and a few undershirts/ t-
shirt.
Footwear and Gloves

You only need a good pair of hiking
boots to walk for days and protect your
feet at the same time. You should bring a
boot repair kit to repair the soles and
bring extra pairs of laces. Sturdy work
gloves are also essential for hand
protection. For colder climates, pack a
pair of winter-rated gloves.
Belts, Hats, and Accessories
A quality belt is essential. It keeps your
pants up, and also functions as a great
tourniquet in a pinch. A good ball or
hiking cap combined with a good pair of
sunglasses will protect you from the sun.
Also, pack a second winter cap that will
cover your ears.


Chapter 5:  Shelter &
Bedding Options
Tents and Traps

Tents are a complicated topic, because
only a few are actually suitable for
bugging out. A tent tends to take up
room, so a small tent can be your best
shelter. A one person model is going to
be a key, but be aware that all the parts
of the tent weigh about eight pounds – so
even a lightweight tent can be difficult
when added to everything else you carry.

If you are only planning to be on the go
for a few days on your own, then
carrying a trap might be a good idea.
Simple traps are useful to trap and
caught small animals.

Sleeping Bags
Sleeping bags provide warmth and
protection on the road and a basic

necessity for bugging out. Find a good
bag that is  suitable for outdoor survival.
Most sleeping bags have some king of
weather rating. Make sure to buy a
sleeping bag that keeps you warm in
cold temperatures.
Groundsheets

A good groundsheet weighs roughly two
pounds and makes your life easier by
preventing discomfort and illness. This
simple sheet will prevent insects or
water getting into your gear or your
sleeping bag. Your groundsheet should
be large enough to fit under your tent.

The sheet should be waterproof, this
enables you to use it in a secondary
capacity. You can use the sheet as  a
wrap for medicine or food in your bag to
save space.

Chapter 6: Sanitation &
Hygiene
People 
often 
underestimate 
the
importance of personal hygiene and
sanitation when preparing for bugging
out. Hygiene-related issues are some of
the most complicated and critical
concerns for outdoor survival.
Personal hygiene pack items for BOB

All-purpose bar of soap: You can
use soap to bathe and wash other
items such as clothes and cooking
utensils. Also, you can use it as a
cleaning agent for open wounds.

Tampons and Sanitary Napkins: You
can 
use 
tampons 
and 
sanitary
napkins for a variety of survival use,
such as gauze-like first aid bandages
and secured with medical or duct
tape and pre-filter dirty water.

Disinfecting 
wet 
napkins:
Antibacterial wet napkins can be
used for spit-bath to clean your body
of grime, bacteria and body oils.
You can use wet napkins to clean

and maintain survival gear such as
cooking pot and utensils.
Travel-size Hand Sanitizer: Hand
Sanitizers has a high alcohol content,
which 
makes 
it 
perfect 
for
disinfecting your hands and any other
body parts.
Diapers: If you are going to travel

with a young child or toddler, then
you’ll need an ample supply of
diapers for 72 hours. This is also
critical for group hygiene.
Small Pack Towel: You don’t need a
normal cotton bath or beach towel.

You need lightweight towels made
from a super-absorbent material,
easy to ring out and quick to dry.
Mini Travel Toothbrush/Pack: You
can survive 72 hours without a

toothbrush, 
but 
is 
basically 
a
morale-boosting 
item. 
Regularly
brushing your teeth on the go is more
a mental than physical exercise that
reminds 
you 
normal, 
routine
behavior is still possible.
Toilet Paper: Pack a few yards of
toilet paper unless you want to use
scavenged paper or leaves.

Chapter 7: First Aid &
Medications

First aid kit is a compartmentalized item
within your BOB. You can build your
own kit from scratch or start with a
prepackaged kit and then supplement it

with additional items.  Prepackaged first
aid kits are available in every general
merchandise store, pharmacy and
grocery store. You need a more
substantial base kit designed specifically
for outdoor enthusiasts, so don’t buy a
generic first aid kit.
First aid kit container
Your first aid kit container should be
waterproof. If the container is not
watertight, then use several watertight
resealable bags. Moisture and water
will completely compromise the efficacy
of many items in the kit including pills,
gauze and bandages.
Miscellaneous medical items

You need a few additional medical items
such as:
Rubber Gloves: You can use them as
water containers and keep items dry,
such as firewood.
Tweezers: For splinters and ticks
Insect Repellent: 100% DEET is
most effective, so buy them. Insect
repellents are flammable and can be
used as a fire-starting aid in windy
or damp conditions.
Safety pins: Safety pins are useful
for gear repairs and emergency
sutures.
Mirror: A mirror is a very useful
hygiene and first aid tool. It’s useful
when self-treating any type of minor

injury to your head, face, eyes or
back. Mirror can also use as a
signaling tool.
Medications
Each individual has his or her own very
specific medical needs and medications.
You should include the following items
in your first aid kit:
Daily prescriptions
Asthma inhalers
Allergy medicines
Medical instruments, such as blood
sugar testers, syringes
Special baby medicines.

Glasses and contacts
If you wear prescription glasses, keep a
backup pair in your bug out bag.
Otherwise, losing or breaking your
primary pair will leave you vulnerable
and dependent. Don’t rely on contacts as
your only vision source, especially if
you are bugging out. Pack a backup pair
of glasses with a backup pair of
contacts.

Chapter 8: Communications
You need Communications for various
reasons, such as sending, receiving and
recording information and navigation.
Whether you are in the process of
evacuating or just trying to survive, you
have to know what others are doing. It
could be keeping tabs on others or
learning about the weather. As a general
rule, you want to make sure that any
communication device you carry can

access emergency communications
bands. Even if the 911 service is out of
service, the emergency broadcast signals
are capable of broadcast in the most
difficult situations.
Cell Phone
Cell phones might not work properly
during a disaster scenario. However,
you need to bring your cell phone with
you just in case. Cell phones can be very
useful for sending and receiving text
messages. Pack a second fully charge
battery and/or a manual hand-crank
charger.

Emergency Radio
An emergency radio is a great
communications device to your BOB.
This could be your only source of
information while you are on your bug

out journey. Knowing disaster updates
will help you coordinate and plan your
travel. Radio broadcasts can also
provide useful information about safe or
dangerous areas as well as supply
schedules, rescue points and imminent
threats. Buy a hand-crank power option
radio for better safety.
Also choose a model that is equipped
with NOAA (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) Weather
Radio. NOAA broadcasts warnings,
weather alert and disaster information
24-hours a day through more than a
thousand transmitters and cover most of
the United States. Even if local TV and
radio stations are not broadcasting,
NOAA will provide you up to date

disaster information.
Area Map
When disaster strikes, don’t solely
depend on your GPS or Smartphone to
provide you with accurate escape
routes.  Buy a local area map and keep it
in your BOB.

Compass
A reliable compass is a necessity for any
survivalist; add on to your BOB.
Two-way radios
If you plan on bugging out with your

family or friends, two-way radios are
important. Pack a set only if they make
sense.
Note pad and pencil
Being able to record information and
leave notes is an important facet of the
communication category. Keep a pencil
and a waterproof note pad in your BOB.
Chapter 9: Fire
Fire has been the core of human survival

since the beginning of time and the
ability to create fire is the most
important survival skill on earth. Fire
allows a survivalist to accomplish a
wide variety of life-sustaining tasks.
Following are several ways you can use
fire to help stay alive:
Heat: In certain situations, fire may
be your only way to control your
body’s core temperature and stave
off severe cold. You can use heat
from the fire to stay warm and dry
gear, clothes and shoes.
Hypothermia is the number one
outdoor killer and fire is the best
way to battle hypothermic
conditions.
Cooking/Boiling: You can use fire to

cook and boil drinking water.
Signaling: Creating smoke signals
during the day and signal fires at
night are two effective and proven
techniques of survival. Both
techniques have saved the lives of
countless lost survivors.
Morale: In a disaster, 90% of
survival is dependent on a person’s
mentality and fire can go a long way
in boosting one’s morale in a
disaster scenario. The light and
warmth a fire provides is uplifting,
calming and empowering.

Your own fire kit
Fire kit simply means a small
compartmentalized container within your
BOB. You can use a number of

containers for your fire kit. Several
examples are:
Watertight, boxes, tubes and bags
Sealed aluminum containers with o-
ring
Non-watertight containers packed in
resealable bags
Fire-starting tinder
The ignition source is the half of the fire-
starting equation. Often weather
conditions can make finding dry,
flammable fire tinder very difficult. So
you need fire-starting tinder to guarantee
fire.  Below are several fire tinder
options:

WetFire Fire-Starting Tinder:
WetFire is a brand name and very
popular among outdoor travelers.
WetFire will light and burn while
floating in water.
Steel Wool: Common steel wool is
one of the best fire-starting materials
available in the market. The steel

wool can use to ignite combustible
tinder, such as leaves, paper, dried
grass, etc.
Pet Balls: You can use homemade
pet balls as a fire starter. Simply
saturate a few cotton balls with
petroleum jelly and store them in a
watertight container. The petroleum
jelly will act as a fire extender and
ignite with just a spark.
Chapter 10: Tools
Independent off-grid survival requires
you to perform unfamiliar tasks with

efficiency. Without the proper tools,
even the simplest of survival tasks are
extremely difficult, labor-intensive and
time consuming. Following are some
must have specialized tools for your
BOB:
1. Survival Knife: After an ignition

device and a metal container, your
survival knife is the third most
important item in your BOB. Don’t
be fooled by what you see in the
movies, an actual survival knife is
simple and not flashy. Below a list to
show you how a knife can assist you
with a wide variety of tasks:
Hunting
Cutting
Dressing game
Digging
Hammering shelter anchors
Carving
Making fire
Building shelter

Food preparation
Signal mirror
2. Multi-Tool: A quality multi-tool is
like having a lightweight, compact
toolbox in your BOB. Many multi-

tools have up to ten different
functions/ tools built into one unit.
Just like your survival knife, these
tools can be used for numerous tasks
in a survival environment.
 
3. Machete: A machete can be an

incredibly useful tool if you have to
go through any kind of wilderness
area. Machetes make fast work of
chopping trees and gathering wood.
They are also very useful when
clearing thick brush and blazing
trails through dense undergrowth and
it makes a very efficient digging tool
as well.
 
Chapter 11: Lighting
In a disaster scenario, the electricity
will almost certainly be off-grid.
Besides natural sources like the sun and

the moon, your only light source is
what’s inside your Bug Out Bag. There
are countless reasons why you should
include a few light sources:
Nighttime or low-light time travel:
Traveling outdoors in nighttime or
low-light conditions without a
flashlight can be very dangerous for
you.
Setting up camp in low light: A
flashlight come in handy when
setting up and breaking up camp in
low light.
Signaling: You can use a high
intensity flashlight as a signaling
device for rescue.

Lighting options
Pack one main flashlight, one very small
backup light and one alternative light
source.

1. Main Flashlight- LED Headlamp:
Buy a hands-free LED headlamp.
They are extremely lightweight, last
a very long time and keep your hands
free for other works. Headlamps
provide sufficient light for normal
tasks such as traveling, preparing
meals and setting up camp.

2. Backup- Mini Maglite LED: The
mini Maglite LED is an ideal backup
for BOB flashlight.
3. Alternate light sources: Candle and
glow sticks are two very good
alternate light sources.

 

Chapter 12: Protection &
Self-Defense
This book is a complete and thorough
guide how to build a Bug Out Bag and
survive in a disaster scenario for a long
time. Protection and self-defense is an
integral part of survival. Disaster
sometimes brings out the absolute best in
people and they help people in the form
of donations or hands-on labor.
Unfortunately, there are people in this
world who want to take advantage of
chaos and disorder that surround
disasters to further victimize people

through robbing, looting, violence and
rape. You must be prepared to defend
yourself and family members from
looters and gangs should the need arise.
Self-Offense
Often the best self-defense is self-
offense. Self-offense means taking every
precaution possible to avoid any kind of
confrontation. This includes evading
from and removing yourself from
confrontational, questionable or
dangerous situations. Below are self-
offense tips and guidelines that can help
you avoid risky situations:
Embrace humility and check your
ego and pride at the door. They have

no place in a survival scenario.
Don’t flash your tools and supplies.
Keep your behavior low-key, be
observant.
There is safety in numbers, so never
travel alone unless you have no
choice.
Make decisions based upon facts.
Never assume anything
Question everyone, trust no one.
Don’t just acknowledge your gut
feeling- act on it.
Self-defense options
Your body: If trained properly, your
body can be an effective defense

weapon against looters. Take a local
self-defense course or join a regular
self-defense training class. Hand-to-
hand combat is risky and dangerous
and it should be your absolute last
option of self-defense or self-
offense.

Pepper Spray: Pepper spray is really
useful in a hazardous situation and
this is why military, police and
security professionals carry pepper
spray. Carry a canister of Cold Steel
Inferno pepper spray as a part of
your BOB.
Survival Knife: We have discussed
about the survival knife in the
previous chapter. Using a survival
knife is certainly considered as
close quarters, hand-to-hand combat.
Even with training, using knife for
self-defense is dangerous.
Regardless, it is still a viable self-
defense option.
Machete: Machete is not only an
effective deterrent, but it can be an

incredibly effective weapon to keep
an attacker or looter at bay.
Bug Out Gun: In the wrong hands,
guns can cause more harm than good,
so they aren’t for everyone. Don’t
carry a gun unless you know how to
use it. If you don’t have a good idea

about guns then get some training
from a firing range that offers gun
ownership classes. When buying a
gun, you can choose between a rifle,
shotgun or handgun. In a disaster
scenario, you can’t take all of them
or even two of them because it isn’t
practical. As I previously mentioned
that you don’t want your stuff to
make you a target. So your gun
should be hidden and concealed
from the view of others. The best
type of Bug Out gun is a revolver.
They are very easy to conceal, and
fairly lightweight. Depending on the
model, a typical revolver holds
between five to nine rounds of
ammunition and they are fairly

simple to maintain.

Chapter 13: Miscellaneous
Items

Some of the items in this chapter might
be considered luxury items by some,
others would consider them necessities.
Let’s discuss them:
Resealable Bags: Resealable bags
are an excellent disaster survival
item. In a pinch, they can be used as
carrying containers or water storage.
They provide an added layer of
protection and very useful when
moisture-proofing various items.

Contractor-Grade Trash Bags:
Contractor-grade 55-gallon trash
bags can be used for a variety of
survival related tasks, including:
BOB water-proof pack liner
Ground cover

Poncho
Waste storage and disposal
Shelter canopy
Flotation device
Water container/collection
Rescue signal

N95 Dust Mask: The centers for
Disease Control (CDC) recommend
the use of an N95 mask to prevent
the spread of various airborne
viruses, including H1N1. The mask
traps bacteria, viruses and particles

that would otherwise be inhaled.
550 Parachute Cord: The strength of
550 parachute cord makes it a very
popular cordage choice in a disaster
scenario. Carrying 10 feet is enough.
Following are some usage of this

cord:
Repairs
Fishing line
Shelter building
Snares
Belt
Emergency climbing rope
Binoculars: Some may think it is a

luxury item, but can be very useful if
you can carry it in your BOB. Some
of the advantages of a binocular:
Inspect Bug Out location before
approaching
Avoid threats
Look for best travel routes
Look for rescue or help
Observe other people from afar
Keep track of team members
Read signage

Small Fishing Kit: If you have
enough food in your BOB, then it is
not necessary. However, a small
fishing kit weights very little and
comes handy in a disaster scenario.

Small Sewing/Repair Kit: Small
sewing kit is virtually weightless
and very useful to make necessary

clothing or gear repairs while in
route.
Rubber Tubing: If you are not
packing a water filter system that
contains rubber tubing, pack rubber
latex surgical tubing. In can be used
for many survival requests. Some
include:
Drinking straw for hard to reach
water supply

Siphon
Tourniquet
Makeshift fishing spear gun
Makeshift slingshot
 
Duct Tape: You can use duct tape as:

phones or vending machine.

 
Conclusion
Only collecting tools is not enough, you
should practice them. Gear works best
for you when you are familiar and
comfortable with them. Your kit should
be comfortable, easy to use, and fit
within your budget. Remember, you can
buy good quality gear and survival
books like this one. But you can’t buy
mental and physical readiness. You also
can’t buy the survival skills that only
come from experience, practice and
repetition.
Survival tools are very important. But

relying only on tools can be a false sense
of security. Packing BOB with right
tools are the beginning of your
preparedness journey. You must also be
mentally and physically fit and ready to
follow through with your Bug Out Plan if
and when you find yourself in a difficult
situation. With mental preparedness you
will be better equipped to handle any
bad situation with requisite gear.
