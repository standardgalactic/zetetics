Synthesis Lectures on Engineering, Science, 
and Technology

The focus of this series is general topics, and applications about, and for, engineers 
and scientists on a wide array of applications, methods and advances. Most titles cover 
subjects such as professional development, education, and study skills, as well as basic 
introductory undergraduate material and other topics appropriate for a broader and less 
technical audience.

Preface 
The book describes technology and engineering with Systems Thinking. This is a way  
of exploring and describing complex entities by looking at connected wholes and 
relationships rather than separate parts. 
I became familiar with the methodology of systems thinking—after studying engi-
neering and physics—when I participated in an International Research Group of the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (IRG-OECD). In a Report 
(1974) it was concluded that the application of systems thinking and general systems 
theory is especially suited for developing a convenient framework for interdisciplinary 
engineering, bringing together its many aspects currently scattered through the scientiﬁc 
and technical literature. 
Based on this experience, I applied systems thinking over the years in interdisciplinary 
research in Tribology at BAM, the German Federal Institute for Materials Research and 
Testing, and in my lectures on Mechatronics at the University of Applied Sciences, BHT 
Berlin. 
The book presents the systems approach to technology in six chapters. 
1. Scope of Technology 
2. The System Concept 
3. Tribological Systems 
4. Mechatronic Systems 
5. Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 4.0 
6. Systems Thinking in Health Technology. 
I am grateful to Michael Luby, Executive Editor Springer Nature New York, who asked 
for a contribution to the new Springer Synthesis Lectures.

Scope of Technology 
Technology today is marked by Friedrich Rapp in his book Analytics for Understanding 
the Modern World [1] as follows:
. “Modern technology has emerged from the combination of craftsmanship and skill and 
scientiﬁc method. Generally speaking, technology is about objects and processes of the 
physical world, which are created by social action based on the division of labor. Products 
can be manufactured and procedures applied that were previously completely unknown 
and there is hardly any area of life that is not shaped by modern technology” …. 
The signiﬁcance of technology for human life has been emphasized by the French 
philosopher Remi Brague in his book The Wisdom of the World [2]:
. Technology is a kind of morality and maybe even the true morality. Today, technology is 
not only something that enables us to survive, it is more and more what enables us to live. 
The development of technology is closely linked to the progress of physics. Figure 1.1 
compares their basic areas in a simpliﬁed overview. Mechanics is the basis for all 
mechanical technologies from mechanical engineering to civil engineering and aeronau-
tics. Energy technology is based on thermodynamics. Electromagnetism is the physical 
basis for electrical engineering and the use of “energy from the socket” for all areas of 
human life. Electronics enables today’s fast information and communication technology 
and, with computer networks, the global Internet. Optics opens up the universe through 
telescopes and the microcosm through microscopes. Quantum physics is the physical basis 
for micro-technology and nano-technology.
Technology is based on physics, but the methodology of technology is fundamentally 
different from the methodology of physics.

Scope of Technology
Fig. 1.1 Physics and technology in a comparative presentation of their fundamental areas
. Physics explores nature with the methods of “reductionism and analysis”, founded by 
Descartes and Newton: breaking down a problem into its simplest elements and their 
analysis for the recognition of elementary forces and natural constants.
. In contrast, technology requires a “holistic” methodology for the development, pro-
duction and application of products and technical systems. Fundamental to technology 
are systems thinking and interdisciplinary engineering. 
1.1
Basics of Technology and Engineering 
Engineering sciences are the sciences that deal with the research, development, design. 
production, and application of technical products and technical systems. The classical 
engineering sciences are civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineer-
ing and production engineering. More recent courses of study are precision engineering, 
energy technology, chemical engineering, process engineering, environmental technology 
and technical computer science. In the twentieth century, new interdisciplinary courses 
of study were created in line with the growing needs of technology, business and soci-
ety, e.g. mechatronics as a combination of mechanics—electronics—computer science or 
industrial engineering by combining economics (business administration, economics) and 
law with one or more engineering sciences to form a separate ﬁeld of knowledge. 
Based on the state of science and technology in the twenty-ﬁrst century and the cur-
ricula of technical universities and colleges, the fundamentals of engineering sciences can 
be presented in a “knowledge circle” with four basic areas of disciplines, see Fig. 1.2:
1. Mathematical and scientiﬁc fundamentals Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Chemistry

Metrology, Controls, Computer Engineering 
3. Fundamentals for products and services Development, design, production 
4. Economic and legal fundamentals Business administration, management, standardiza-
tion, law, patents. 
The individual disciplines required for interdisciplinary engineering sciences can be 
assembled from the knowledge circle in a modular fashion. For example, the collection 
of fundamentals for the curriculum of Industrial Engineering is illustrated Fig. 1.3 The 
collection of fundamentals for the curriculum of Mechatronics is illustrated Fig. 1.4.

The Product Cycle 
The technology product cycle illustrates that all technical products—accompanied by the 
necessary ﬂow of materials, energy, information, manpower and capital—move in “cy-
cles” through the techno-economic system. From resources of matter and raw materials, 
the engineering materials—metals, polymers, ceramics, composites—are processed, and 
transformed by design and manufacture into products and systems. At the end of use, 
deposition or recycling of scrap and waste is necessary, Fig. 1.5. The production cycle 
requires the succession of several technologies:
. Raw material technologies for the exploitation of natural resources.
. Material technologies for the production of materials and semi-ﬁnished products 
from the raw materials. The structural and functional materials, required for tech-
nical products, must correspond to the application proﬁle and must accordingly be 
optimized.
. Design methods, i.e. the application of scientiﬁc, mathematical and art principles for 
efﬁcient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems.
. Production technologies, which concerns the manufacture of geometrically deﬁned 
products with speciﬁed material properties. Means of production are plants, machines, 
devices, tools and other production equipment.
. Performance, maintenance and repair technologies to ensure the functionality and 
economic efﬁciency of the product.
. Finally, processing and recovery technologies to close the material cycle by recycling 
or, if this is not possible, by landﬁlling.

1.2
The Product Cycle

Fig. 1.5 Illustration of the technology product cycle
From an economic point of view, the production cycle can be regarded as an “economic 
value-added chain”. 
The illustration of the production cycle, Fig. 1.5, reminds us that the components of 
technical products and systems interact with their environment in their technical function. 
These interactions are generally described as two complementary processes:
. Immission, the exposure of substances or radiation on materials and technical products, 
which can lead to corrosion, for example.
. Emission, the discharge of substances (e. g. CO2) or radiation (also sound). An emis-
sion from a material is usually at the same time an immission into the environment. 
To protect the environment—and thus people—there are legal regulations for emission 
and immission control with procedural regulations and limits for harmful substances and 
radiation. With regard to the protection of the environment, the main requirements are:
. Environmental compatibility, the property of not adversely affecting the environment 
in its technical function (and on the other hand not being adversely affected by the 
environment in question).
. Recyclability, the possibility of recovery and reprocessing after the intended use.
. Waste disposal, the possibility of disposing of material if recycling is not possible.

Scope of Technology
1.3
Corner Stones of Technology 
The technology product cycle, presented in Fig. 1.5, shows that the base technologies for 
all fabricated products are Material, Energy and Information. 
1.3.1
Material 
Materials constitute the physical matter of all technical products. They result from the 
processing and synthesis of matter, based on chemistry, solid state and surface physics 
transformed by materials engineering, design and production into technical products, 
Fig. 1.6. From the view of materials science, materials can be of natural (biological) ori-
gin or synthetically processed and manufactured [3]. According to their chemical nature 
they are broadly grouped traditionally into inorganic and organic materials. Their physical 
structure can be crystalline, or amorphous, or mixtures of both structures. 
Scale of Materials 
The geometric length scale of materials has more than twelve orders of magnitude. The 
scale spectrum embraces nanoscale materials with quantum structures, microscale materials, 
and materials with macroscale architectures for macro engineering, assembled structures 
and engineered systems. Figure 1.7 illustrates the dimensional scale relevant for today’s 
technology.
Processing of Materials 
For their applications, materials have to be engineered by processing and manufacture in 
order to fulﬁl their purpose as constituents of products, designed for the needs of economy 
and society. There are the following main technologies to transform matter into engineered 
materials, see Fig. 1.8:
. Net forming of suitable matter (liquids, molds), e.g. LASER printing

Fig. 1.8 Materials and their characteristics result from the processing of matter 
. Machining of solids, i.e. shaping, cutting, drilling, etc.,
. Nano-technological assembly of atoms or molecules. 
Characteristics of Materials 
Experience shows that materials have four basic characteristics, depicted as tetrahedron to 
illustrate that they are interrelated [4], Fig. 1.9.
In a general compilation, the basic scientiﬁc, engineering and technological aspects of 
materials can be jointly depicted in a holistic view, Fig. 1.10.
The properties of materials, which are of fundamental importance for their engineering 
applications, can be categorized in three basic groups, broadly classiﬁed in the following 
categories:
. Structural materials: engineered materials which have speciﬁc mechanical or thermal 
properties in responding to an external loading by a mechanical or thermal action.

. Functional materials: engineered materials which have speciﬁc electrical, magnetic or 
optical properties in responding to an external loading by an electromagnetic or an optical 
action.
. Smart materials :engineered materials with intrinsic or embedded sensor and actuator 
functions, which are able to accommodate materials in response to external loading, with 
the aim of optimizing material behavior according to given requirements for materials 
performance. 
Numerical values for the various materials properties can vary over several orders of mag-
nitude for the different material types. An overview on the broad numerical spectra of some 
mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of metals, inorganics and organics are shown 
in Fig. 1.11.
It must be emphasized that the numerical ranking of materials in Fig. 1.11 is based on 
“rough average values” only. Precise data of materials properties require the speciﬁcation 
of various inﬂuencing factors described above and symbolically expressed as follows:

1.3.2
Energy 
Energy is one of the fundamentals areas of physics and is divided into the following 
categories:
. Mechanical energy 
– Potential mechanical energy characterizes the working capacity of a physical 
system, which is determined by its position in a force ﬁeld. 
– Kinetic mechanical energy is the work capacity that an object can generate due to 
of his movement. It corresponds to the work that must be done to move the object

10

Scope of Technology
from rest to momentary motion. It depends on the mass and the velocity of the 
moving body.
. Electrical energy is deﬁned as the working capacity that is generated by means of 
electricity, transmitted or stored in electric ﬁelds. Energy that is transferred between 
electrical energy and other forms of energy means electrical work.
. Thermal energy (heat energy) is involved in the disordered motin of atomic or molec-
ular components of a substance. It is a state variable and is part of the inner energy. A 
radiation ﬁeld has thermal energy when its energy is distributed disorderly among the 
various possible waveforms.
. Chemical energy is distributed in the form of a chemical compound, stored in an energy 
carrier and in chemical reactions which can be released. 
All forms of energy are largely convertible into each other and therefore equivalent to 
each other. During energy conversions, the total energy, i.e. the sum of all energies of a 
closed system is constant (law of conservation of energy). Energy is the working capacity 
of physical systems. Thus, it is of outstanding technical and economic importance. 
The metrological unit of energy (or work) is the joule. Because of the diversity of 
forms of energy and the different value ranges of released energy, different units have 
developed, which are equivalent to each other. Mechanical energy is often given in New-
ton meters (N · m), thermal energy and chemical energy in general in the SI unit joule 
(J), electrical and magnetic energy in watt seconds (W · s). The following equivalence 
applies: 1 J = 1 N · m  = 1 W s.  
Energy technology is an interdisciplinary engineering science, with the technologies for 
the production, conversion, storage and use of energy. Primary energy production refers 
to the ﬁrst stage where energy enters the supply chain before any further conversion or 
transformation process. Energy carriers are usually classiﬁed as
. Fossil, using coal, crude oil and natural gas,
. nuclear, using uranium,
. Renewable, using hydro power, wind and solar energy, biomass, among others. 
The energy content of energy sources is either heat that can be used for household 
and industrial purposes, or the energy content is made available by mechanical, ther-
mal, or chemical transformation as electrical energy (electricity production). In a power 
station, mechanical energy is usually generated by means of generators into electrical 
energy, which is usually fed into the power grid. Mechanical (kinetic) energy for drive 
of generators comes from water or wind movements or uses—via steam turbines or gas 
turbines—thermal energy from burning coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, garbage or nuclear 
energy. Photovoltaic systems convert radiation energy directly into electricity. Important 
framework conditions for energy technology are

(b) Environmental aspects (e.g. pollutant emissions), 
(c) Energy conversion efﬁciency, the ratio of useful energy to primary energy, expressed 
as efﬁciency η = Eoutput/Einput in percent. 
Examples of energy conversion efﬁciency:

– Gas heating 80 … 90% 
– Coal-ﬁred furnace (industry) 80 … 90% 
– Solar collector up to 85 
– Electric range (household) 50 … 60%.

– Hydropower plant 80 … 90% 
– Gas/steam turbine power plant (natural gas) 50 … 60 
– Coal-ﬁred power station 25 … 50% 
– Wind turbine up to 50 
– Nuclear power plant 33% 
– Solar cell 5 … 25. 
Energy is an indispensable resource for human existence [5]. Just to stay alive, a 
human being needs an average daily food intake of about 3000 kilocalories (kcal), which 
represents a food-related energy equivalent of about 1200 kilowatt hours (kWh) per year. 
The total consumption requirement of people to energy (heating, electricity, fuels, etc.) 
has been estimated to be about 15 times higher. With a world population of more 7 billion 
people, the annual global energy demand sums up to about 140,000 billion kWh (500 × 
1018 J) primary energy. 
An overview of energy technology with regard to the energy end users is given in 
Fig. 1.12. In Germany, the primary energy demand accounts for approximately 2.8% 
of the world’s energy demand [6]. The basic feature of electricity energy is shown in 
Fig. 1.13.
Electrical energy is the most versatile energy source, which can be converted into 
other forms of energy with very low losses. The availability of electric power is a basic 
prerequisite for any modern industry and cannot be replaced by other energy sources. 
Experience shows that a failure of the electricity supply brings any economy to a standstill 
and must therefore be limited as far as possible. A high level of security of supply of 
electricity is therefore an important condition for technology, economy and society.

Information and Digitalization 
Information is the third basic technology besides energy and material. The umbrella term 
information and communications technology (ICT) refers to the methods and processes

of generating, transmitting, storing and applying information (data, numbers, charac-
ters) for use by science, technology, business and society. The scientiﬁc foundation of 
today’s information and communication technology is digitalization (or digitization) of 
information, mathematically based in the “Binary System”, Fig. 1.14. 
Digitalization is the conversion of text, pictures, or sound into a digital form that can be 
processed by a computer. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 1.15. An information, acquired 
by a sensor (sensor input) is ﬁrst converted in an analog electrical signal (sensor output) 
and then converted into a binary signal sequence by an analog-to-digital AD converter. 
Since the processing of digital (binary) signals only requires a distinction between two 
signal states (0 or 1 or low or high), error-free information transfer to a computer and data 
storage is possible in principle. The information is usually transmitted in cryptographically 
secure information data blocks (block chains). Figure 1.15 provides an overview of the 
methodology of digitalization for information and communication technology.

In the digital world of information and communication, Computers have a central 
role in information and communication technology. They are technical systems that can 
be instructed by an operator to carry out arithmetic or logical operations automatically via 
computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of 
operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely 
wide range of tasks. 
A computer consists of a central processing unit (CPU), and a memory, typically a hard 
disc drive (HDD). The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations. 
Peripheral devices include input devices (keyboards, mice, etc.), output devices (monitor 
screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions. Peripheral 
devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the 
result of operations to be saved and retrieved. An overview of the computer’s architecture 
together with a photo of a hard disc drive is given in Fig. 1.16. 
Digitization of Pictures 
In order to digitize a picture, the picture is scanned, i.e. split into a matrix with rows and 
columns (the picture is “pixelated”). This can be done by scanners, photography, satellite-
based or medical sensors. For a black and white raster graphic without grey tones, the image 
pixels are assigned the values 0 for black and 1 for white. The matrix is read out line by line, 
resulting in a sequence of the digits 0 and 1 that represents the picture. When digitizing color 
images, each color value of a pixel in the RGB (red–green–blue) color space is decomposed 
into the values red, green and blue, and these are stored individually with the associated 
quantization.

Text Digitization 
When digitizing text, the document is ﬁrst digitized in the same way as an image, i.e. scanned. 
If the original appearance of the document is to be reproduced as accurately as possible, 
no further processing takes place and only the image of the text is stored. If the linguistic 
content of the documents is of interest, the digitized text image is translated back into a 
character set by a text recognition program, e.g. using the ASCII code (American Standard 
Code for Information Interchange) or, in the case of non-Latin characters, the Unicode (ISO 
10646). Only the recognized text is then saved. 
Digitization of Audio/Video Signals 
The digitization of audio data is called sampling. Sound waves are converted into analog 
electronic vibrations with a microphone as sensor and measured and stored as digital values. 
These values can also be “put together” to form an analog sound wave, which then can be 
made audible. Due to the large amounts of data that are generated, compression methods 
are used. This allow the realization of more space-saving data carriers, e.g. FLAC (Free 
Lossless Audio Codec) or MP3 (lossy compression of digitally stored audio data). 
Optical data memories store data sequences in the form of pits and lands (plateau) in a 
compact disc (CD) for audio data or in a digital video disc (DVD) for video data. 
The data track information is read out in a CD/DVD player by mechanical contactless 
scanning with a LASER scanning unit when the CD/DVD is rotated. Pits and lands have 
a height difference leading to LASER-beam interference. The alternation of pits and lands 
is detected as a dark/light change (bit “1”). The laser beam reﬂection at individual pits or 
lands returns bits “0”. This results in a serial 1–0 data stream (data output), which is fed to 
a photo detector, giving an output as an analogue audio or video signal sequence will.

Greatest Engineering Achievements 
A comprehensive analysis of the situation and signiﬁcance of technology at end of the 
twentieth century was conducted by the US National Academy of Engineering (www. 
nae.edu). The Greatest Engineering Achievements are shown in Fig. 1.17 in the order 
speciﬁed by the Academy.
The most important technology is ELECTRIFICATION. Its worldwide importance for 
all areas of human life as well as for all of technology, economy and society is obvious, 
and is clearly illustrated by the scenario of the catastrophic consequences of blackout: 
collapse of information and communication possibilities (telephone, TV, Internet) and 
failure of the entire electriﬁed infrastructure, from rail transport to drinking water supply. 
Because of its central importance for technology, economy and society, ELECTRIFICA-
TION is called the “Workhorse of the Modern World” by the Academy. The other major

and their grouping according to human needs—from communication and human mobil-
ity to water supply and health technologies—underline the indispensable role of modern 
technology for industry, economy, society—and human life in general! 
New developments—especially the “digitalization of information” and the “Internet of 
Things”—emerges in recent years. The scope of today’s technology can be characterized 
as follows:

The System Concept 
The classical method of scientiﬁcally analyzing objects of interest is “analytical reduc-
tionism”. An entity, i.e. the object of an investigation, is virtually broken down into its 
individual parts so that each part could be analyzed and described. This principle can 
be applied analytically in a variety of directions, e.g. resolution of causal relations into 
separate parts, searching for “atomic units” in science or for “material constants” in engi-
neering. Application of the classical analytical procedure depends on the condition that 
interactions between the Parts are non-existent or, at least, weak enough to be neglected 
for certain research purposes. 
The systems approach goes beyond the methodology of analytical reductionism. It 
considers how the parts interact with the other constituents of the system forming an 
entity of “organized complexity” [1]. 
2.1
General Systems Theory 
In this approach, a system is a set of elements interconnected by structure and function. 
The behavior of a system is the manner in which the whole or parts of a system act and 
react to perform a function. In characterizing the behavior of systems, the terms structure 
and function also must not be isolated from each other, because the structure and the 
function of systems are interconnected.

The abstract formalism of the General Systems Theory should be supplements by a classi-
ﬁcation scheme indicating the “type” of system under study. According to Norbert Wiener, 
the founder of Cybernetics [2], the input and output of systems may be broadly classiﬁed 
into the three categories Material, Energy and Information. As physical or engineering 
systems are composed of materials components, whose properties, interactions, etc. may 
change with time, the parameter time is an independent attribute of any of these systems.

Technical Systems 
For the characterization of multicomponent technical products, instead of poorly dis-
tinguishable expressions such as “machine”, “device”, “apparatus”, the generic term 
“Technical System” has been ﬁxed. 
• Technical Systems are characterized by their function to generate, convert, transport 
and/or store material, energy and/or information. They have a spatial structure and 
are composed of components, which emerge from design and production technology 
(Brockhaus Encyclopedia, 2000). 
• Technical Systems are designed and build by Interdisciplinary Engineering. 
2.2.1
Mechanical and Electrical 2-Body Systems 
The application of the system concept to the characterization of technical devices is exem-
pliﬁed for the simplest case of “2-body systems”, namely a mechanical gear pair and an 
electrical transformer, in Fig. 2.1. The  function of both systems is to transfer operating 
inputs, namely.

• speed and torque in the mechanical system, and 
• voltage and current in the electrical system 
into transformed functional outputs for the intended technical purpose. 
Regarding the structure of the two systems, a fundamental difference between the 
electrical and the mechanical system has to be noted with respect to their performance: 
• In the electrical system, the function of the system is realized through electromagnetic 
coupling processes between the two elements of the system. The macroscopic structure 
of the electrical 2-body system remains constant with time. A possible submicroscopic 
deterioration process can be electromigration. 
• In the mechanical system, the function is realized through (Hertzian) contact mechanics 
and frictional traction of the interacting gears, inevitably connected with friction-
induced energy losses. The interfacial functional stress may cause geometrical changes 
of the gear pair (“pitting” type of wear). Because the mechanical system operates with 
“interacting surfaces in relative motion”, it is a “tribological” system. 
2.2.2
Multicomponent Technical Systems 
Emanating from the principles of General Systems Theory and engineering experience, 
the basic features of Multicomponent Technical Systems can be described as follows: 
• A technical system is a set of elements (engineered components) interconnected by 
structure and function. 
• The Function of technical systems is to generate, store, transmit or/and transform 
energy, materials and/or information. 
• The Inputs are to be distinguished as 
– operating inputs {X}, responsible for the functional task of the system, Note: inputs 
can execute “loads” and “stress” on the structural components of a system 
– auxiliary inputs {XA}, (e.g. energy support), 
– disturbances {Z} from the environment (e.g. vibrations, moisture, electrical smog). 
• The Outputs are to be distinguished as 
– functional outputs {Y}, responsible for the functional task of the system 
– Loss outputs {YL}, can be 
energy loss, (e.g. due to friction), 
material loss or emissions, (e.g. wear debris, CO2 emission), 
information loss, (e.g. analog/digital (A/D) mistakes).
• The Structure S = {A, P, R} of technical systems consists of multiple components 
{A}, designed and manufactured with their properties {P} and interactions {R} for 
a given task. If the structure of a system changes with time t, for example due to

detrimental changes of element properties (P) or relations (R) under working loads L 
(e.g. force, temperature), the structure of a system is load-and-time dependent and is 
represented by the set

The basic features of Technical Systems can be illustrated in a “holistic view”, Fig. 2.2. 
There is a broad spectrum of multicomponent technical systems. With regard to their 
functional areas and structural features, the following main categories of technical systems 
can be distinguished: 
• Technical systems for the realization of motion and the transmission of mechan-
ical energy with interacting surfaces in relative motion, especially in mechanical 
engineering, production, and transport. 
– Tribological Systems 
• Technical systems that require for their tasks the combination of mechanics, electron-
ics, controls, and computer engineering. 
– Mechatronic Systems 
• Technical systems with a combination of mechatronics and internet communication. 
– Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)

Physical State Variables and Process Elements 
A starting point for the consideration of physical state variables of technical systems is the 
“Quadrupole Model”. In this model, originating from electrical engineering, the operating 
input parameters of technical systems are the variables effort ε and ﬂow φ. They are State 
Variables of technical systems and their product gives the physical power p = ε · φ. The 
state variables for different system types are listed in Fig. 2.3. 
Process Elements for the generation and processing of the process variables in technical 
systems are described with key words in the lower part of Fig. 2.3.
Fig. 2.3 Physical state variables and process elements in technical system types 

2.3
Physical State Variables and Process Elements
25
They are “building blocks” of technical systems. A prominent example which is 
designed with all process elements shown in Fig. 2.3 is a Wind Energy Converter—the 
most important technical system for renewable energy technology—see Fig. 4.30. 
The functional behavior of a technical system can be categorized in different states, as 
illustrated in Fig. 2.4. 
Stationary behavior 
If the inputs and outputs are stationary (time-independent) and the structure of the 
system S = {A, P, R} is stable, the functional outputs {Y} may be describable as 
functions of the operating inputs {X} as linear input–output function. 
Dynamic behavior
If the inputs and outputs vary with time, the system is said to be in a “dynamic state”. 
The dynamic (time-dependent) behavior of a system is conventionally characterized by 
two different input test functions:
Fig. 2.4 Illustrations of the functional behavior of technical system 

26

The System Concept
(a) a harmonic undamped sinusoidal input x gives a sinusoidal output y with an ampli-
tude ratio y0/x0 and a phase shift of the output signal. Such behavior is called in 
the terminology of control theory “second-order behavior”. 
(b) a step function input x gives an output response y in the form of a ﬁrst-order 
differential equation. This is called in the terminology of control theory a “ﬁrst-
order behavior”. It is characterized by a delay time constant τ which is a measure 
of the system’s inertia. 
Stochastic behavior 
In some situations, the functional input–output relations may be inﬂuenced by stochas-
tic processes, i.e. dynamic effects of uncertainty and random disturbances (“noise”). 
In such cases, an estimate of the limits of proper systems behavior by means of the 
theory of probabilities may be attempted. 
2.4
Modeling of Technical Systems 
The physical background of modeling physical systems is given by Richard Feynman in 
his famous Lectures on Physics [3] and illustrated in Fig. 2.5: 
We can study electrical and mechanical systems by the principle that the same equations 
have the same solutions. In an electrical circuit with a coil of inductance L and a voltage 
V, the electrical current I depends on the voltage according to the relation V = LdI/dt. 
This equation has the same form as Newton’s law of motion. The rate of doing work on the
Fig. 2.5 Analogy between simple mechanical and electrical systems 

2.4
Modeling of Technical Systems
27
inductance is voltage times current, and in the mechanical system it is force times velocity. 
Therefore, in the case of energy, the equations not only correspond mathematically, but also 
have the same physical meaning as well. 
In the modeling of technical systems, often simpliﬁed “modules” are considered, con-
sisting in the mechanical case of a mass-spring-damper structure and in the electrical case 
of a inductance-resistance–capacitance structure. This modeling approach is illustrated in 
Fig. 2.6. 
The analogy between mechanical and electrical modules can be used for the computer-
aided modeling of technical systems. An example is illustrated in Fig. 2.7.

Design of Technical Systems 
General Principles of Engineering Design have been suggested by the Royal Academy of 
Engineering (www.raeng.org.uk) at the end of the twentieth century with the following 
statement: 
“In engineering it is possible to identify basic principles which can be referred to by 
all designers of any discipline. These principles are intended to provide a total context for 
good design. They are not necessarily rooted in physics or mathematics, and derive more 
from experience, practice or pragmatism than from formal theory. They are the substance 
of professional engineering judgement. It is possible to consider engineering design as 
encompassing three stages: 
(i) All design begins with a clearly deﬁned need. 
The deﬁnition of Need requires the recognition and understanding of the nature 
of society, of economics, of humanity’s needs. The human qualities of reason, 
compassion, service and curiosity all contribute to the deﬁnition of need. 
(ii) All designs arise from a creative response to a need. 
Creative Vision requires the ability to think laterally, to anticipate the unexpected, 
to delight in problem solving, to enjoy the beauties of mind as well as of the 
physical world. The ethos within which the problem is being addressed must be 
understood. 
(iii) All designs result in a system which meets the need. 
To Deliver a solution to the recognized need requires the assembly and manage-
ment of resources and of team members with the necessary skills and knowledge 
of natural laws and of the materials and energies needed to affect an efﬁcient and 
appropriate creative design”. 
This very general design principles can be concretized by combining the description of 
technical systems (Fig. 2.2) with the design principle “Structure follows Function”. This 
leads to the following systems approach to design: 
Deﬁnition: A System is a Set of Elements Interconnected by Structure and Function

2.6
Performance and Reliability of Technical Systems
29
Design Principle: Structure Follows Function 
1. Deﬁne the function of the system and specify the necessary input and outputs; consider 
also auxiliary inputs and disturbances. 
2. Realize the structure of the system with engineered components {A}, designed and man-
ufactured with their properties {P} and interactions {R} to fulﬁl the function; consider 
also functional stress on the structural elements and dissipations. 
In addition to the interdisciplinary design of the system it may be necessary to 
• install a control module with sensors, actuators and appropriate algorithms, 
• monitor the system with structural health monitoring and performance control. 
2.6
Performance and Reliability of Technical Systems 
In their applications, technical systems have to fulﬁl various tasks. The material compo-
nents have to bear “functional stress” of mechanical, thermal and electromagnetic nature. 
They are also in contact with other solid bodies, aggressive gases, liquids or biological 
organisms because there is no usage of materials without interaction with the environ-
ment [4]. All these actions on materials have to be recognized in order to avoid faults and 
failures, deﬁned as follows [5]: 
• Fault (FR Panne, DE Fehlzustand): the condition of an item that occurs when one of 
its components or assemblies degrades or exhibits abnormal behaviour. 
• Failure (FR Defaillance, DE Ausfall): the termination of the ability of an item to 
perform a required function. Failure is an event as distinguished from fault, which is a 
state. 
The systematic examination of materials deterioration mechanisms which may cause 
faults and failures is called root cause failure analysis. An overview of the types of 
functional stress and environmental inﬂuences on materials, and the main deterioration 
mechanisms is given in Fig. 2.8 [6]. 
• Fracture—the separation of a solid body into pieces under the action of mechani-
cal stress—is the ultimate failure mode. It destroys the integrity and the structural 
functionality of materials. 
• Ageing results from all the irreversible physical and chemical processes that happen in 
a material during its service life. Thermodynamically, ageing is an inevitable process,

30
2
The System Concept
however its rate ranges widely as a result of the different kinetics of the single reaction 
steps involved. 
• Electromigration is the transport of material constituents caused by the gradual move-
ment of ions in a conductor due to the momentum transfer between conducting 
electrons and diffusing metal atoms. The effect is important in microelectronics and 
related structures. 
• Corrosion is deﬁned as an interaction between a metal and its environment that results 
in changes in the properties of the metal (ISO Standard 8044). In most cases the 
interaction between the metal and the environment is an electrochemical reaction. 
• Biodeterioration denotes detrimental changes of materials and their properties and may 
be caused by microorganisms (bacteria, algae, higher fungi, basidiomycetes) as well 
as by insects (termites, coleoptera, lepidoptera) and other animals. 
• Wear is the process of deterioration of a solid surface, generally involving progressive 
loss of substance due to relative motion between contacting bodies. Wear is a complex 
process that depends on various system factors and interrelationships. 
Materials deterioration and failures of technical items are due to a complex set of inter-
actions between functional loads and environmental inﬂuences that act on and within a 
system, and the materials that the system comprises. Reliability is deﬁned as the proba-
bility that a technical item will perform its required function [4]. The failure probability 
of a material under load L originates from both the interaction of the statistical scatter 
of the applied load stress σL and the statistical scatter of material properties determin-
ing the macroscopic strength σS of the component. Both quantities are denoted by σ in 
accordance with mechanical stress and strength.
Fig. 2.8 Overview of materials deterioration mechanisms 

2.6
Performance and Reliability of Technical Systems

• Stress means symbolically any physical process acting on the component. This can 
be a mechanical, a thermal, an electromagnetic, a tribological, or an environmental 
load. The load stress σL scatters due to varying conditions of loads and environmental 
inﬂuences. 
• Strength means the ability of the component to withstand stress. Strength σS scatters 
due to scatters of the material properties and to scatters of manufacturing quality of 
the engineered component. 
Failure takes place as soon as the stress distribution interferes with the strength 
distribution. 
The results of various failure studies imply that two conceptual models of failure can 
be anticipated: 
• Overstress failures are catastrophic sudden failures due to a single occurrence of a 
stress event that exceeds the intrinsic strength of a material. Overstress failures are, e.g., 
buckling of materials, electrical failures resulting in electrical discharge, or thermal 
overstress in a polymer beyond glass transition temperature. 
• Damage accumulation is due to stress events that accumulate irreversibly and may 
lead to materials degradation and a gradual reduction of strength. Failure results when 
damage exceeds the endurance limit of the stressed material. Examples of damage 
accumulation are electronic electromigration, mechanical fatigue, tribological wear, 
and corrosion due to contaminants and weathering cycling. 
Figure 2.9 illustrates three different phenomena of reliability and the occurrence of failure:
(a) under normal conditions there is no interference of the stress and strain distributions 
and the failure probability is assumed to be zero, 
(b) under overstress the failure probability increases suddenly (catastrophic failure), 
(c) under damage accumulation the failure probability increases gradually (fatigue-type 
failure). 
It follows that the reliable performance of materials, components and systems requires 
both, the avoidance of overstress through the appropriate choice of functional stress, and 
the control of damage accumulation by structural health monitoring. 
Reliability Considerations 
Reliability is deﬁned as the probability that a technical item will perform its required 
functions without failure for a speciﬁed time period (lifetime) when used under speciﬁed 
conditions. As the lifetime of a device scatters, reliability is a quantity that can only be 
described by means of statistic tools. In order to describe the time dependence of a device’s 
failure behavior, a reliability parameter called failure rate k(t) is used. Simply speaking, it

32

describes the (average) number of failures per time unit. In most cases, if k(t) is plotted 
against time, a typical bathtub-shaped curve is observed, Fig. 2.10. 
The bathtub curve is categorized into three regions:
• Region 1 exhibits a falling failure rate and covers the so-called early failures (infant 
mortality). The origin for those failures in most cases is not related to material properties, 
but rather to the quality of the manufacturing process of the whole device. 
• Region 2 is characterized by a constant failure rate and covers random failures that 
are not governed by a single failure mechanism. In this region, the device fails due to 
miscellaneous interactions with its environment, e.g. peak-like overloads, misuse, high 
temperatures and others.

failure rate as function of time

• Region 3 is the region where material-related failures start to dominate. Therefore, the 
somewhat imprecise phrase wear-out failures is commonly used for this phase. The 
failure modes in this region are often initiated by detrimental changes of the devices’ 
material components, caused by the service loads applied to the device. The mechanisms 
leading to failures are called degradation mechanisms. Typical degradation mechanisms 
are mechanical fatigue, corrosion, wear, biogenic impact, and material-environment 
interactions. 
2.7
Structural Health Monitoring and Performance Control 
The objective of structural health monitoring (SHM) is to monitor and control the struc-
tural integrity of the components and the structure of technical systems. The following 
fundamental axioms for SHM have been formulated [7]: 
I
All materials have inherent ﬂaws or defects. 
II 
The assessment of damage requires a comparison between two system states. 
III Identifying the existence and location of damage can be done in an unsupervised 
learning mode, but identifying the type of damage present and the damage severity 
can generally only be done in a supervised learning mode. 
IV Sensors alone cannot measure damage. Feature extraction through signal process-
ing and statistical classiﬁcation is necessary to convert sensor data into damage 
information. 
V 
The length- and time-scales associated with damage initiation and evolution dictate 
the required properties of the SHM sensing system. 
VI There is a trade-off between the sensitivity to damage of an algorithm and its noise 
rejection capability. 
VII The size of damage that can be detected from changes in system dynamics is 
inversely proportional to the frequency range of excitation. 
The SHM process involves the observation of a system over time using periodically 
sampled dynamic response measurements from an array of sensors, the extraction of 
damage-sensitive features from these measurements, and the statistical analysis of these 
features to determine the current state of system health. 
The application of technical diagnostics to the monitoring and diagnostics of structures 
is exempliﬁed in Fig. 2.11.
Performance Control 
The control of a functional parameter of a technical system with sensors and non-destructive 
evaluation (NDE) such that a signiﬁcant change is indicative of a developing fault is called

Condition Monitoring [4]. The application of conditional monitoring allows maintenance 
to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to avoid the consequences of failure, before 
the failure occurs. Examples of metrological condition monitoring parameters of technical 
systems of different machine types are exempliﬁed in Fig. 2.12.
Combining the methodologies of structural health monitoring and performance control, 
a general scheme to support the functionality of technical systems results, which is shown 
in Fig. 2.13.

Tribological Systems 
The term tribology was coined 1966 in the UK after a comprehensive study on the enor-
mous technological and economic importance of friction, lubrication and wear [1] with 
the following deﬁnition: Tribology is the science and technology of interacting surfaces 
in relative motion and of related subjects and practices. The collection of controlling fac-
tors and relationships affecting friction and wear is referred to as a Tribological System 
[2]: a structure of interacting surfaces in relative motion to perform a speciﬁed technical 
function. 
Tribology has a “dual” character. 
• On one hand, interacting surfaces in relative motion are necessary to realize technical 
functions like 
– the transmission of motion, forces and energy via interfacial traction, 
– the machining or forming of materials with workpiece-tool pairings, 
– transportation by wheel-rail or tire-road locomotion systems, 
– control of the ﬂow of liquids and gases with pipelines and seals, 
– medical technologies supporting motion functions of the human body. 
• On the other hand, interacting surfaces in relative motion may lead to friction-induced 
energy dissipation and wear-induced materials deterioration. The impact of friction 
and wear on energy consumption, economic expenditure, and CO2 emissions has been 
outlined as follows [3]: 
– In total, about 23% of the world’s total energy consumption originates from tri-
bological contacts. Of that 20% is used to overcome friction and 3% is used 
to remanufacture worn parts and spare equipment due to wear and wear-related 
failures.

– By taking advantage of the new surface, materials, and lubrication technologies for 
friction reduction and wear protection in vehicles, machinery and other equipment, 
energy losses due to friction and wear could considerably be reduced. 
– The largest energy savings through tribological expertise are envisioned in trans-
portation (25%) and in the power generation (20%) while the potential savings in 
the manufacturing and residential sectors are estimated to be about 10%. 
3.1
Characteristics of Tribological Systems 
Basically, the science and technology of tribology is concerned with the optimization 
of technical systems from the study of friction and wear. This involves not only the 
properties of the materials in contact but also various system factors, such as the nature 
of the relative motion, the nature of the loading, the shape of the surface(s), the surface 
roughness, the ambient temperature, and the composition of the environment in which 
the wear occurs. As a consequence, some form of operational classiﬁcation is needed to 
evaluate the material, mechanical, and environmental elements that can affect wear rates 
of a part. 
Typical tribological systems (in short tribosystems) are exempliﬁed in Fig. 3.1 [4].

Function of Tribological Systems 
There is a broad variety of technical functions which can only be realized with tribological 
systems. Examples are compiled in Table 3.1. 
3.1.2
Structure of Tribological Systems 
The structure of a tribological system consist of the components in contact and relative 
motion with each other [triboelements (1) and (2)], the interfacial element (3) between the 
contacting parts, and the ambient medium (4). Examples of the four basic triboelemnts 
are given in Fig. 3.2.
The structure of tribosystems may be either “closed” or “open”. Closed means that all 
components are involved in a continuous, repeated, or periodical interaction in the friction 
and wear process, for example, as in bearings or a gear drive. Open means that the element 
in the tribosystem is not continuously involved in the friction and wear process and that 
a materials ﬂow in and out of the system occurs, for example, workpieces in machining. 
Basic structural parameters of triboelements (1) and (2) include: 
• Geometric parameters: geometry, shape, dimenaions 
• Chemical parameters: bulk chemical and molecular composition 
• Physical parameters, such as thermal conductivity 
• Mechanical parameters, such as elastic modulus, hardness, and fracture toughness. 
Surface parameters of triboelements (1) and (2) are of special importance because tribo-
logical systems are based on interacting surfaces in relative motion. The characteristics

3.1.3
Operational Parameters of Tribological Systems 
The basic operational parameters of tribological systems are: 
• Type of motion, classiﬁed in terms of sliding, rolling, spin, and impact and their 
possible superposition. The kinematics can be continuous, intermittent, reverse, or 
oscillating.

3.2
Interactions in Tribological Systems
41
• Normal load (FN), deﬁned as the total force (including weight) that acts perpendicular 
to the contact area (A) between the contacting elements, where the contact pressure, 
p, is given by p = FN /A. 
• Velocity (v), speciﬁed as the vector components and the absolute values of the 
individual motions of the contacting elements. 
• Temperature (T) of the structural components at a stated location and time. In addi-
tion to the operating (steady-state) temperature, the friction-induced temperature rise 
(average temperature rise and ﬂash temperatures), must be measured or estimated on 
the basis of friction heating calculations. 
• Duration (time t) of the operation, performance or test. 
– The basic set of operational parameters can be expressed as: {FN, v . T, t}.

Interaction parameters characterize the action of the operational parameters on the 
structural components of a tribological system. An overview is given in Fig. 3.4 [2].

3.2.1
Contact Mechanics 
The geometric conﬁguration of contact between two parts is either a conformal or a 
counterformal (nonconforming) contact, Fig. 3.5. 
Conformal Contact: If two nominally ﬂat and dry solid materials (1) and (2) are brought 
into static contact under the action of a normal load, the touching asperities of this tri-
bocontact deform elastically or plastically under the given load. The dominating contact 
deformation mode is governed by a deformation criterion (the so-called plasticity index), 
which depends on the deformation properties and the parameters of the surface topogra-
phy of the contacting bodies (1) and (2) [5]. The summation of individual contact spots 
gives the “real area of contact”, Ar, which usually is much smaller than the “apparent 
geometrical area” Ao of the contact. The real area of contact depends in the elastic case 
primarily on the ratio of FN to the elastic modulus of both bodies, and in the plastic case 
on the ratio of FN to the yield pressure or the hardness of the softer of the contacting 
bodies. 
If, in addition to the normal load, a tangential force is introduced, a junction growth 
of asperity contacts may occur. The microscopic interaction forces between contacting 
solids include, at least in principle, all those types of atomic and molecular interac-
tion that contribute to the cohesion of solids, such as metallic, covalent, and ionic, 
that is, primary chemical bonds (short-range forces), as well as secondary van der

Waals bonds (long-range forces) [5]. These surface forces depend in a complicated 
manner on the physico-chemical nature of the structure and composition of the outer-
most surface layers and contaminants of the material of triboelements The interfacial 
local stress-adhesion-deformation-shear processes in the stochastically distributed micro-
contacts cause—independent from the nominal geometric contact area—the frictional 
resistance against motion. 
Counterformal Contact. For curved bodies, the macroscopic elastostatic contact situa-
tion is described by the well-known Hertzian equations. If a tangential force FT < FN · 
f0 (where f0 is the static coefﬁcient of friction) is additionally applied to a static Hertzian 
contact, a separation of the Hertzian contact area in a slip area and stick area takes place 
before a macroscopic horizontal relative motion between body (1) and body (2) occurs. 
In the case of macroscopic relative motion, the superposition of normal forces, FN, and  
frictional forces FF > FN · f0 (perpendicular to FN) in a tribocontact leads to complex 
stress distributions in the contacting bodies. The multiaxis stress condition may be con-
verted into a uniaxial tensile stress in such a way that the uniaxial tensile load affects the 
material to the same extent as the multiaxial stress state. 
The contact scales of tribological systems are illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 3.5. 
Macroscale tribology refers to tribosystems with dimensions from millimeters up to 
meters; sliding speeds are in the range of approximately 1 mm/s to more than 10 m/s. The 
function of macroscale engineering components—to transmit motion, forces, and mechan-
ical energy—is governed by dynamic mass/spring/damping properties of the interacting 
elements. 
Microscale tribology typically involves devices that are 100–1000 times smaller than 
their macroscale analogs. Thus, the volume of components on this scale is reduced by a 
factor of at least 106. As an example, the technology of microelectromechanical (MEM) 
systems is an interdisciplinary technology dealing with the design and manufacture of 
miniaturized machines, with the major dimensions at the scale of tens to hundreds of 
micrometers. Masses and inertias of MEM components rapidly become small as size 
decreases, whereas surface and tribological effects, which often depend on area, become 
increasingly important. 
Nanoscale tribology involves phenomena from the submicroscopic to the atomic scale. 
It is not possible to link the test results obtained at the nanoscale with friction and 
wear phenomena at the macroscopic scale, mainly because atomistic models are not 
directly scalable [6]. For the diagnosis of friction and wear test data it must be noted 
that the conditions in which nanotribology and macrotribology tests take place—using, 
for example atomic force microscopes (AFMs) for nanotribology and pin-on-disc testers 
for macrotribology—are very different. AFM tips induce stresses in the gigapascal range,

44

Tribological Systems
whereas macroscale testers operate in the kilopascal range. Atomic force microscopes typ-
ically allow sliding amplitudes of only a few micrometers, whereas macrotesters sliding 
amplitudes range from hundreds of micrometers up to meters. 
3.2.2
Fundamentals of Friction 
Friction is the resistance to motion, when under the action of an external force one body 
moves or tends to move relative to another body. The quantity to be measured to charac-
terize friction – in the terminology of metrology called the measurand of friction—is the 
friction force FF. The friction force is a vector to be characterized by its direction and 
its quantity value. The coefﬁcient of friction f is a dimensionless number, deﬁned as the 
ratio between the friction force FF and the normal force FN acting to press the two bodies 
together f = FF/FN. The average frictional power PF is deﬁned as frictional energy EF 
divided by the operating duration, t (that is, PF = EF/t). For sliding friction, PF = FF · v 
= f · FN · v. 
The physics of friction has been explained by Richard Feynman in his famous Feynman 
Lectures on Physics [7], see information box. 
Physics of Solid Friction* 
“Dry sliding friction occurs when one solid body slides on another. A force is 
needen to maintain motion. This force is called a frictional force and its origin is a 
very complicated matter. Both surfaces of contact are irregular, on the atomic level. 
There are many points of contact where the atoms seem to cling together, and then, 
as the sliding body is pulled along, the atoms snap apart and vibration ensues. As 
the slider snaps over the bumps, the bumps deform and then generate waves and 
atomic motions, and, after a while, friction-induced heat in the two bodies”. 
Sliding Friction Model on the Atomic Scale 
Quantity values of the friction coefﬁcient. “Tables with data of friction coefﬁ-
cients for materials, like “steel on steel” or “copper on copper”, are all false. The

3.2
Interactions in Tribological Systems
45
friction is not due to “copper on copper” because the surfaces in contact are not 
pure copper but are mixtures of oxides and other impurities. It is impossible to get 
the right coefﬁcient of friction for pure metals because if ultraclean pure metal sur-
faces are brought into contact the interfacial atomic forces became cohesive and the 
two pieces stick together. The friction coefﬁcient which is ordinarily less than unity 
for reasonably hard surfaces becomes several times unity”. 
This concise statement was conﬁrmed by friction measurements made by 
NASA**. Depending on the interfacial and ambient conditions, the following data 
were measured for the friction coefﬁcient f of „copper on copper”: 
f = 0.08, measured under boundary lubrication (mineral oil), 
f = 1.0, measured as solid friction in air, 
f > 100, measured as solid friction in vacuum (10−10 Torr).

Friction Mechanisms 
An overview of the mechanism of friction can be obtained from considering the energy 
balance (energy dissipation event) of solid friction. The mechanical energy associated with 
solid friction between two solid triboelements (1), (2) involves the following, Fig. 3.6:

III. Dissipation processes: 
(i) thermal processes, 
(ii) absorption in (1) and (2) with residual stresses, generation of point defects and 
dislocations, stacking fault energy 
(iii) emission, e.g. heat, debris, noise, triboluminescence, exo-electrons. 
The occurrence of friction mechanisms depends on the structural and operational parameters 
of the tribosystem in question. All of the partial processes of friction in Fig. 3.6 have been 
experimentally observed in various studies [4]. 
Experimental Example: Dry Sliding Friction of Steel on Steel 
The simplest type of tribotest is to subject a given tribosystem to a deﬁned constant set of the 
basic operational parameters {load FN, velocity v, temperature T} and to measure friction 
or wear quantities as functions of time t only. 
A typical graph for the course of the friction coefﬁcient f = FF/FN of a dry metal/metal 
sliding system as function of time t is shown in Fig. 3.7. The friction-time curve consists in 
a simpliﬁed presentation of four stages [4].
• At stage I, the initial value of the friction coefﬁcient is usually about f0 ≈ 0.1. It dependents 
at low loads, FN, mainly on the shear resistance of surface contaminants, but is largely 
independent of material combinations. Surface layer removal and an increase in adhesion 
due to the increase in clean interfacial areas as well as increased asperity interactions and 
possible wear particle entrapment lead to a gradual increase in the friction coefﬁcient. 
• Stage II, which produces the maximum value of the friction coefﬁcient (fmax ≈ 0.3 
…1.0 for most metal pairs), is reached when maximum interfacial adhesion, asperity 
deformation, and wear particle entrapment occur. 
• In stage III, a decrease in the friction coefﬁcient may occur due to the possible forma-
tion of protective tribochemical surface layers and a decrease in plowing and asperity 
deformation processes. 
• Stage IV is characterized by steady-state interfacial tribological conditions leading 
eventually to almost constant friction coefﬁcient values. 
It should be noted that Fig. 3.7 shows a simpliﬁed smoothed friction graph, which in practice 
may be overlapped by short-term ﬂuctuations, friction peaks, or stick–slip effects. In any

the initial friction coefﬁcient, f0, (b) the maximum friction coefﬁcient, fma, (c) the friction 
coefﬁcient at the end of test, fﬁnal. 
3.2.3
Friction and Lubrication 
Friction forces under lubricated conditions are mostly lower than those of solid friction 
and depend on the shear resistance of interfacial boundary ﬁlms and on the rheology of the 
lubricant. The basic tribological parameter of friction and lubrication is the dimensionless 
ﬁlm-thickness to roughness ratio λ [4]. 
The experimental veriﬁcation of the dependence of friction on the ﬁlm-thickness to 
roughness ratio λ is demonstrated in Fig. 3.8 [7]. A cylinder-on-ﬂat model conﬁguration 
with a constant load FN was used as test system and the tests were performed with three 
decreasing lubricant viscosity values at oil bath temperatures of 20 °C (A), 30 °C (B), 
and 40 °C (C). The sliding velocity v was stepwise increased, kept constant at every data 
point for 5 s, and the friction force FF was measured with a force sensor. Simultane-
ously, an information on the nature of the contact (metal/metal or metal/lubricant/metal) 
was obtained by measuring the electrical contact resistance Reletr., between the sliding 
triboelements. A contact resistance of Relectr. < 10 Ω indicates metal/metal contact, and 
Relectr. > 50 kΩ indicates separation of the sliding surfaces by the lubricant ﬁlm. With a

48
3
Tribological Systems
fast signal discrimination technique, the no-contact time fraction was determined. Thus, 
a distinction between solid/solid contact and the existence of an interfacial lubricant ﬁlm 
could be achieved. The graphs of the friction coefﬁcient and the no-contact time fraction 
are shown on the left-hand side of Fig. 3.8. The friction graphs show the well-known 
shape of the Stribeck curve. (Stribeck was the ﬁrst to describe the friction of sliding 
lubricated journal bearings with this curve [8].) 
The single Stribeck curves A, B, C show a different inﬂuence of surface roughness 
and lubricant viscosity on friction at the left hand side and at the right hand side of the 
curves: 
• Friction decreases at the left hand side of the Stribeck curves with decreasing sur-
face roughness (“run-in” effect from curve A to curve A*) and decreases also with 
increasing lubricant viscosity (sequence of curves C, B, A). 
• At the right hand side of the Stribeck curves, the inﬂuence of surface roughness on 
friction disappears (curve A* coincides with curve A), and friction increases with 
increasing lubricant viscosity (sequence of curves C, B, A). 
A generalized Stribeck curve could be obtained by combining the experimentally deter-
mined friction and no-contact data with calculated ﬁlm-thickness data based on the 
elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication theory and on the values of the operational 
and materials parameters of the tests. The generalized Stribeck curve characterizes the

3.2.4
Fundamentals of Wear 
Wear is the process of deterioration of a solid surface, generally involving progressive 
loss of substance due to relative motion between contacting bodies, that is, the interacting 
elements of a tribosystem. The measures and units used to quantify wear are illustrated 
in Fig. 3.10: 
Fig. 3.10 Wear measuring quantities

50

Tribological Systems
• Wear length, Wl: one-dimensional changes in the geometry of interacting triboelements 
perpendicular to their common contact area. 
• Wear area, Wq: two-dimensional changes of cross sections of interacting triboelements 
perpendicular to their common contact area. 
• Wear volume, WV: three-dimensional changes of geometric regions of interacting tri-
boelements adjacent to their common contact area. Wear volumes are connected via 
density or speciﬁc gravity with wear masses or wear weights. 
A further wear parameter is the wear coefﬁcient, k (or wear rate), which is deﬁned as 
k equals u pper W Subscript upper V Baseline divided by upper F Subscript upper N s Baseline left parenthesis mm cubed slash upper N m right parenthesis
The wear coefﬁcient k gives a relation between the wear volume and the operational 
parameters load and sliding distance causing wear. The denominator (in units of N m) 
of the wear rate (k) multiplied by the coefﬁcient of friction FF/FN gives the value of 
dissipated energy (in units of MJ). 
Wear Mechanisms 
The chain of events leading to wear is illustrated in Fig. 3.11. Tribological loading com-
prises the actions of contact mechanics, relative motion, and contacting matter, activated 
by frictional energy. The action of contact forces and stresses in combination with relative 
motion trigger the wear mechanisms of surface fatigue, abrasion, and the materials degra-
dation processes listed in the left part of Fig. 3.11. The contacting matter initiates—together 
with interfacial and ambient media—the wear mechanisms of tribochemical reactions and 
adhesion in combination with debris formation processes. All these processes and their inter-
ference lead to wear: surface damage and wear particles. The combined materials degradation 
effect of wear and corrosion is called tribocorrosion. Wear surface appearances are shown 
in Fig. 3.12 [4].
Wear Regimes and Wear Data 
An overview of the range of wear data is given in Fig. 3.13. Depending on the interfacial state 
of a tribosystem—lubricated sliding, unlubricated sliding, wear by hard particles—the wear 
coefﬁcient k can vary over more than six orders of magnitude. A wear coefﬁcient of 10–6 is 
conventionally indicating the border between tolerable removal of surface boundary layers 
to mild and severe wear. Abrasive hard particles cause even higher wear. The lowest wear 
can only be achieved when the triboelements (1) and (2) are completely separated by a ﬂuid 
ﬁlm, realized by elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication, or hydrostatic or hydrodynamic 
lubrication.

Wear and Reliability 
Reliability describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated con-
ditions for a speciﬁed period of time without failure. Consider as a starting point for 
the reliability considerations of tribosystems the wear behavior as function of time. It is 
experimentally observed that for time-dependent wear, three different wear stages can be 
distinguished: 
• Self-accommodation or running-in wear 
• Steady-state wear 
• Self-acceleration (catastrophic damage) of wear. 
These wear-mode changes in the system behavior may follow each other with time, as 
indicated in Fig. 3.14.
In Fig. 3.14, Wlim denotes a maximum admissible level of wear losses. At this level 
the system structure has changed in such a way that the functional input–output relations 
of the system are disturbed severely. Repeated measurements show random variations in 
the data, as indicated by the dashed lines. 
From sample curves of wear, a probability density function, f (t), of the time for reach-
ing the maximum admissible level of wear (Wlim = constant) is obtained. For a given 
time, t0, the shaded area under the curve f (t), i.e. the value of F(t0), is a measure of the 
probability that the system fails within the time t < t0. 
For the modeling of the distribution of measured wear data and the estimation of relia-
bility data, statistical distributions may be used. If for a given tribosystem the failure mode

Fig. 3.14 The dependence of wear on time, and failure and reliability functions
and the failure distribution can be determined, this knowledge can be used to improve the 
reliability of the system. For tribosystems failing as a consequence of wear processes, the 
failure behavior may be characterized by the Normal distribution, the Weibull distribu-
tion, or the Gamma distribution. Their mathematical functions and statistical parameters 
are well documented in the statistical literature.

Condition Monitoring of Tribological Systems 
The most widely used methods for Condition Monitoring of Tribological Systems are 
Vibration Monitoring and Non-destructive Evaluation. 
Vibration is deﬁned as a periodic motion about an equilibrium position. Its duration 
and magnitude depend upon the degree of damping the effected materials possess and the 
phase relationships between the mechanism that perturbs the system and the response that 
is obtained. Vibration may be forced through unbalance, rub, looseness and misalignment, 
or freely self-excited through internal friction, cracking and resonance. 
Once generated, vibration can be transmitted from its source to other components or 
systems. When it reaches unacceptable levels, tribological wear and tear processes are 
accelerated, which in turn initiate various failure mechanisms. Hence, by monitoring for

or shock pulse, the consequences of avoidable breakdowns can be prevented. Figure 3.15 
illustrates the general methodology of vibration monitoring. 
An application example of condition monitoring of a bearing is given in Fig. 3.16. It  
illustrates the changes that a frequency spectrum—obtained from vibration accelerometer 
readings—will undergo as an outer race spall develops for a bearing with a speciﬁc outer 
race defect frequency [9].
Nondestructive Evaluation 
A wide variety of inspection and detection techniques are available to provide users with 
the speed, accuracy, and cost-efﬁciency needed to probe, identify, and diagnose features 
of import in validating quality control and product ﬁtness. Table 3.2 gives an overview of 
established NDE methods for technical diagnostics.

Testing of Tribological Systems 
Tribotesting has the task to investigate the inﬂuence of friction and wear on the function 
and structure of tribological systems. Basic objectives are: 
• Evaluation of the impact of friction and wear on the performance, reliability, and safety 
of engineering tribosystems or tribocomponents. 
• Quality control of tribocomponents. 
• Characterization of the trihological behavior of materials and lubricants. 
• Investigation of basic tribological processes, and friction-induced energy losses or 
wear-induced materials losses. 
Laboratory friction and wear experiments must be based—as all experiments in science 
and technology—on the principles of measurement and testing.

Categories of Tribometry 
Depending on the structure and function of the tribological system under consideration, the 
tests can be grouped into six basic categories, see Fig. 3.17 [10].
Tests of category I are performed with actual tribomachinery under practical conditions. 
Clearly, these tests represent the real performance of the object under study. However, 
full-scale ﬁeld tests are usually very expensive. The broad spectrum of the practical oper-
ating conditions often cannot be adequately characterized, and considerable efforts are 
necessary to conﬁrm test results in a statistical manner in repeated tests. 
In tests of category II–IV, in which actual tribomachinery, tribosystems, or tribocom-
ponents are studied in well-deﬁned bench tests, test results can be related to the actual 
triboengineering structures. An important consideration of these tests is the appropriate 
choice of operational conditions, which may be simpliﬁed, simulated, or accelerated as 
compared with the often unknown broad spectrum of the practical full-scale operational 
conditions. Sometimes attempts are made to determine the actual operational conditions 
of the full-scale ﬁled performance with sensors and to simulate these conditions in less 
expensive bench tests. Because tribotests of categories I–IV differ in scope and testing

Testing of Tribological Systems

conditions, the techniques and procedures to be applied for the determination of friction 
and wear quantities must be related to the individual tests and cannot be generalized. 
In tests of category V, model test specimens are used rather than actual tribocomponents. 
If an attempt is made to simulate actual triboengineering conditions with these tests, a suf-
ﬁcient similarity in the basic tribological parameters must be realized. These parameters, 
include: 
• The determination of the physico-chemical nature of the model test specimens 
and the triboengineering system to be simulated (use of the same materi-
als/lubricant/environment combination and connected materials properties) 
• Similarity of the contact and lubrication mode—characterized by similar counterformal 
or conformal contact conditions, and a similar working point in the Stribeck curve—to 
be obtained through an appropriate similarity in the kinematics, and the suitable choice 
of load, FN, velocity, v, temperature, T, and test duration. 
Tests of category VI are used primarily in fundamental studies of friction and wear 
processes. The conditions of these tests are often selected to study speciﬁc tribological

phenomena rather than to simulate real triboengineering behavior. These tests range from 
Macrotribology and Microtribology to Nanotribology. 
3.5
Laboratory Tribometry 
Laboratory friction and wear experiments are mainly designed for categories V and VI of 
tribotests. In tests of category V, test-specimen models are used rather than actual com-
ponents. If an attempt is made to simulate actual engineering conditions with these tests, 
a sufﬁcient similarity in the basic tribological parameters must be realized. These param-
eters include: similar working point in the Stribeck curve—to be obtained through an 
appropriate similarity in the kinematics and the suitable choice of load (FN), velocity (v), 
temperature (T), and test duration (t). The determination of the physicochemical nature 
of the model test specimens and the engineering system to be simulated (use of the same 
materials/lubricant/environment combination and connected materials properties). 
Laboratory tribometry is used primarily in fundamental studies of friction and wear. 
There are four groups of parameters to be recognized in laboratory tribometry [10] 
• Structural parameters of the triboelements (1), (2), (3), (4). 
• Operational parameters including the kinematics and a suitable choice of load (FN), 
velocity (v), temperature (T), and test duration (t). 
• Quantities to be measured (denoted as “tribomeasurands” in the terminology of 
metrology). 
• Surface characteristics of the test specimen (1) and (2) before and after testing. 
A general scheme for laboratory measurement of friction and wear is shown in Fig. 3.18.

3.5.1
Methodology of Tribometry 
The methodology of laboratory tribotests to study friction and wear with measurement, 
testing and sensor technology consists basically of the following steps [10]. 
1. Choose a suitable test conﬁguration for the test specimens. Specify the geometry of the 
test conﬁguration, the bulk materials properties and metallurgical description, and the 
surface topographies and characteristics. Note that the interfacial tribological processes 
act differently on each of the two triboelements depending on the contact-area to wear 
track ratio, see Fig. 3.19. 
2. Characterize the interfacial element (for example, the lubricant) and the environmental 
medium or atmosphere in terms of their chemical nature, composition, and chemical 
and physical properties. 
3. Choose a suitable set of the operational parameters, including type of motion, load FN, 
velocity v, temperature T, and test duration t. 
4. Perform the tests as functions of varied structural parameter of the triboelements 
(for example, hardness or roughness) and/or operational parameter (for example, load 
cycles or velocity variations). The conditions of the tests, such as the time dependence 
of operational parameters, should be controlled by appropriate detectors or sensors and 
supported by on-line computer techniques. 
5. Measure the basic tribomeasurands, namely friction force and wear quantities. If of 
interest determine triboinduced thermal quantities (for example, friction-induced tem-
perature rise), or triboinduced physical emissions (e. g. noise, vibrations), or chemical 
emissions (e.g. CO2) or wear particle debris.

cesses on the tribocomponents

6. Investigate the surface characteristics of worn surfaces with respect to surface 
chemistry and surface topography (and wear particles) in order to identify wear 
mechanisms. 
7. Record the tribodata and present the results of tribotesting in an appropriate manner. 
The full set of data from the tribosystems and the resulting tribological quantities shall 
be saved in a tribological data archive system. 
In addition to the determination of tribomeasurands, surface characteristics of the 
interacting materials have to be determined. 
The scheme of a tribometer prototype is shown in Fig. 3.20. 
3.5.2
Surface Investigations 
After a tribotest, the worn surfaces (and subsurface regions) of triboelement (1) and 
triboelement (2) should be analyzed with respect to surface topography and surface 
composition. Diagnosis of wear mechanism requires imaging worn surfaces as well as 
information on the local chemical composition and microstructure of the near-surface 
material. In addition, subsurface defects such as cracks or pores should be identiﬁed. Var-
ious techniques are employed to study tribological surfaces and subsurface regions. These 
include imaging techniques and methods of microstructural and compositional analysis.

The methods vary in the information they provide in both lateral extent and depth into 
the surface. In addition, analysis of wear debris and wear particles is performed. 
Surface Chemical Analysis. Besides the bulk materials chemistry, surface characteristics 
of materials are of great signiﬁcance. The main techniques of surface chemical analysis 
are [10]: 
• EDX: energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy 
• ESCA, XPS: electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, x-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy 
• AES: auger electron spectroscopy 
• SIMS: secondary ion spectrometry. 
An overview of the instrumental features of this techniques are given in Table 3.3. 
AES is excellent for elemental analysis (exception H, He) at spatial resolutions down 
to 10 nm, and XPS can deﬁne chemical states down to 10 μm. Both analyze the out-
ermost atom layers and, with sputter depth proﬁling, layers up to 1 μm thick. Dynamic 
SIMS incorporates depth proﬁling and can detect atomic compositions signiﬁcantly below 
1 ppm. Static SIMS retains this high sensitivity for the surface atomic or molecular layer 
but provides chemistry related details not available with AES or XPS.

Surface Topography Analysis. The basic methods for surface topography measurements 
arestylus proﬁlometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical interferometry, and scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM) (Ref. [4]). Figure 3.21 gives an overview on data and 
experimental principles. The basic features of the techniques for surface topography 
analysis can be summarized as follows [10]: 
• Stylus proﬁlometry: The pick-up draws a stylus (diamond tip, 60° or 90°, radius of 
1–10 μm) over the surface, and an analog electrical signal of the surface proﬁle is 
produced by a piezoelectric, inductive or laser interferometric transducer. The spatial 
resolution achieved by this method, generally in the range of 2–20 μm, is limited by 
tip geometry and local plastic deformation. 
• Atomic force microscopy: In an AFM, a sharp tip with a radius of approximately 5– 
20 nm, mounted on a very soft cantilever with a spring constant in the range of 1 N/m, 
is scanned over the surface by a xyz actuator with a resolution of much less than a 
nanometer and a dynamic range on the order of 10 μm in the z direction and up to 
100 μm in the x- and y-directions. 
• Optical interferometry: Interference microscopy combines an optical microscope and 
an interferometer objective into a single instrument. These optical methods allow 
fast noncontacting measurements on essentially ﬂat surfaces. Interferometric methods

offer a subnanometer vertical resolution, being employed for surfaces with average 
roughnesses down to 0.1.
• Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can provide both topographic (for example, from 
secondary electron detection) and compositional (such as the mean atomic number 
from back-scattered electrons) information. SEM is an important tool to identify wear 
mechanisms from the appearance of worn material surfaces as illustrated above in n 
Fig. 3.21. 
3.6
Presentation of Tribodata 
The presentation of the results of tribometry can be done in various ways to describe the 
system-dependent of tribodata: 
• The time-dependence of friction is illustrated in Fig. 3.7. 
• The time-dependence of wear is illustrated in Fig. 3.14. 
3.6.1
Dependence of Tribodata on Operational Parameters 
In addition to graphs illustrating the time-dependence of friction and wear, tribodata may 
be presented as function of the operational parameters {load force FN, velocity v, temper-
ature T}. The dynamic action of operational parameters may change the initial nominal 
structural parameters of materials (e.g. surface roughness, composition, microstructure). 
These changes inﬂuence in turn the friction and wear behavior of materials and their 
tribodata expressed in tribographs. 
The dependence of the friction coefﬁcient on the operational parameters {FN, v,} for 
two different temperature T is illustrated in Fig. 3.22 for the example of pin-on-disc test 
system consisting of a polytetraﬂuorethylene, (PTFE) pin sliding on a smooth steel surface 
[10] Two essentially different friction regimes are observed: 
(a) a low friction regime with a friction coefﬁcient of f ≈ 0.03 at low sliding velocities 
v < 1 cm/min, and 
(b) a regime of increasing friction values, f ≈ 0.03→ 0.3 for v > 1 cm/min.
The friction graphs of Fig. 3.22 show that at high contact pressures and low sliding 
velocities, low friction results. Optical micrographs of the steel surfaces indicate a thin 
polymer ﬁlm adherent at the steel surface. Friction is low because the polymer chains 
orient themselves in the sliding direction and can be easily sheared. In the high friction

64
3
Tribological Systems
Fig. 3.22 Example of the dependence of the friction coefﬁcient on the set of operational parameters 
{FN, v, T}
regime, the polymer chains have not sufﬁcient time to orient themselves in the sliding 
direction. Higher frictional shear forces are needed and the polymer transfer to the steel 
surface consists of polymer lumps. 
3.6.2
Dependence of Tribodata on Structural Parameters 
Tribodata are not correlated in a simple way with nominal structural properties of mate-
rials (like modulus or strength) because in its initial stages, friction and wear depend 
on contaminants and surface layers. If contaminants and outer surface layers are rubbed 
away, for example by an abrasive material, a correlation of the wear resistance with the 
hardness of the tribologically stressed material can be observed. Figure 3.23 shows sim-
pliﬁed tribographs of the dependence of the abrasive resistance on the hardness for various 
classes of materials [10]. It must be emphasized that the trends indicated are found only 
when the hardness of the abrasive is at least about 1.3 times that of the material.

3.6.3
Influence of Ambient Media on Tribodata 
Ambient media can signiﬁcantly affect the tribological behavior of materials. Figure 3.24 
shows an example of the pronounced inﬂuence of humidity on the tribological behav-
ior for two material pairings: (a) steel/silicon carbide (SiC) and (b) steel/silicon nitride 
(Si3N4) [10]. The test under reciprocating sliding showed very different results for tests 
under low humidity (winter conditions) and high humidity (summer conditions). The dif-
ferent wear values under different humidity are due to the formation of different interfacial 
tribochemical layers. For the steel/silicon carbide couple, the interfacial layers reduced 
both friction and wear, whereas for the steel/silicon nitride couple the wear coefﬁcient 
increased but the friction coefﬁcient remained unchanged. The experimental ﬁndings 
underline the important inﬂuence of atmospheric humidity on interfacial tribocheneistry 
and the resulting tribodata.
3.7
Tribomaps 
Tribomaps characterize regimes of different tribological processes (or different ranges of 
friction and wear data) by giving boundaries of operational parameters for these regimes. 
For the design of empirical wear mechanism maps, Ashby and co-workers [11] have  
used normalized values for wear rate, load, and sliding velocity deﬁned by: W* = W/A0, 
FN* = FN/A0 · H0, v*  = v · r0/a, where An is the nominal (apparent) contact area of the

66

Tribological Systems
Fig. 3.24 Example of the strong effect of atmospheric humidity on wear of ceramic/steel pairs
wearing surface, H0 is the room-temperature hardness, a is the thermal diffusivity, r0 is 
the radius of the circular nominal contact area, W* is the volume lost per unit area of sur-
face, per unit distance slid; FN* is the nominal pressure divided by the surface hardness, 
and v* is the sliding velocity divided by the velocity of heat ﬂow. In analyzing the results 
of wear tests published in the literature, the different dominating wear mechanisms were 
classiﬁed into the following categories: 
• Seizure 
• Melt-dominated wear 
• Oxidation-dominated wear (mild and severe oxidational wear) 
• Plasticity-dominated wear (including delamination wear). 
For each wear regime, the boundaries of the operational parameters FN and v were 
estimated; the resulting wear map is shown in Fig. 3.25.
3.8
Performance Limits of Tribological Systems 
The performance limits of tribosystems are characterized by Transition Diagrams. They 
are graphical representations of operational parameters separating the region of normal 
operation from the region of failure. Transition diagrams were developed by the Interna-
tional Research Group (IRG-OECD) [12]. The methodology is illustrated in Fig. 3.26 for 
the example of lubricated sliding Hertzian steel point contacts (4-ballsystem).
Step 1: Tribological tests should be run with a deﬁned lubricated Hertzian contact 
system (counterformal point or line contact) under constant operating conditions of sliding 
velocity v, bulk oil temperature T, sliding distance s, and test duration t, with a stepwise 
increased load, FN. The tests may be run either with new specimens for each load step 
(that is, a “no run-in procedure” where t < 10 s), or continuously with one specimens set 
(that is, a “run-in procedure”). The friction coefﬁcient, f, and wear volume W are then 
measured and the wear coefﬁcient, k = W/(FN · s), is calculated.

Tribological Systems
Step 2: For a constant set of the operational variables (v, T, t, s), the critical load FNcrit 
for the transition from the region of normal operation (partial elastohydrodynamic, EHD, 
lubrication) to the region of failure (incipient scufﬁng) is determined. As shown on the 
left hand side of Fig. 3.26, the failure transition is determined by the following transition 
criteria: 
• friction coefﬁcient f < 0.1→ f > 0.3, 
• wear coefﬁcient k < 10−6 mm3/N m→ k > 5× 10−6 mm3/N m. 
Step 3: The critical failure load, FNcrit is determined for a variation of sliding velocity, 
v (the other parameters T, t, s are held constant). The graph of FNcrit versus the corre-
sponding values of v is called the IRG Transition Diagram shown on the right hand side 
of Fig. 3.26. Beyond the course of the failure load FN is the region of the termination of 
motion. The different appearance of the contact surface (stationary ball) in the region of 
normal operation and in the failure region is shown in Fig. 3.26 with optical interference 
micrographs. 
In addition to the 2-dimensional failure transition diagram, a 3-dimensional “failure 
surface” representing the critical set of operating variables {FN, v, T}critical at the transition 
from the region of normal operation to the region of failure can be obtained [12]. The 
failure surface characterizes the load-carrying capacity of lubricated concentrated contacts 
as a function of sliding velocity, v, and bulk oil temperature, T. Examples of failure 
surfaces for tribological, systems of different contact geometry are shown in Fig. 3.27. 
Note that the load-carrying capacity before failure is much larger for line contact than for 
point contact.
Application of transition diagrams. With the use of IRG transition diagrams, the inﬂu-
ences of materials properties, lubricant characteristics (for example, viscosity or chemical 
additives), or environmental conditions (for example, inert gas or humidity) on the func-
tional limits of the operational variables of sliding lubricated contacts can be characterized 
[13]. 
3.9
Tribotronics—Technology to Avoid Friction and Wear 
The term tribotronics applies to the integration of electronic control in a tribological. 
System [14]. The electronic control network consists of a sensor, an actuator, and a 
control unit with real time software. The sensor detects a relevant tribomeasurand, for 
example friction force or interfacial displacement. The electrical sensor output is trans-
ferred via the controller unit to an actuator who act on the tribocontact in order to optimize 
the tribological system behavior. The concept of tribotronics is illustrated in Fig. 3.28.
A comparison between a classical tribological system and a tribotronic system is made 
in Fig. 3.29.

Mechatronic Systems 
The term Mechatronics was coined in the 1960s in Japan and is now globally acknowl-
edged. Its deﬁnition has been expressed as follows [1] 
• Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld of engineering, including mechanics, electron-
ics, controls, and computer engineering. 
A collection of prominent examples of mechatronic systems from the macroscale to the 
nanoscale is given in Fig. 4.1.
4.1
Principles of Mechatronic Systems 
Mechatronic systems are characterized by their structure and function, according to the 
General Systems Theory. Mechatronic systems have a basic mechanical structure with 
multidisciplinary mechatronic modules and transform via the systems’ structure opera-
tional inputs (energy, materials, information) into outputs needed to perform a technical 
function. The general scheme of mechatronic systems is shown in Fig. 4.2 [2].
The functional performance of mechatronic systems is controlled with a combination 
of actuators and sensors, and appropriate algorithms. The general block diagram for the 
control loop of mechatronic systems is shown in Fig. 4.3.
The major components of a mechatronic system control unit include a sensor, a con-
troller and an actuator as ﬁnal control element. The controller monitors the controlled 
process variable x, and compares it with the reference, the set point xSP. The difference 
between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the controller error e(t) = 
xSP – x, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process 
variable to the same value as the set point. The diagram of Fig. 4.3 shows a closed loop

the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same value as the “ref-
erence input” or “set point”. To implement intermediate value control, the sensor has to 
measure the full range of the process variable.

Sensors: The Key to Mechatronic Systems 
Sensors have a central role in mechatronic systems as illustrated in Fig. 4.4. They deter-
mine functional and structural parameters of interest and transform them into electrical 
signals that can be displayed, stored or further processed for applications of mechatronic 
systems [3].

of technical systems in an electrical signal are compiled in Table 4.1.
Characteristics of Sensors 
A sensor can be illustrated by a block diagram and described by the sensor function y = 
f(x) which relates the output y to the input x, see Fig. 4.5. If there is a linear input–output 
relation, the sensitivity ε of the sensor is deﬁned as ε = Δy/Δx, and its reciprocal is the

of the strip of the calibration diagram is the range of the maximum permissible errors. The 
accuracy class p of a sensor is deﬁned as p = (Δ/(2ymax)) × 100 (%). 
Measuring Chain for Sensing 
For the  application of sensors, a  measuring chain has to be established. It consists basically of 
the sensor and units for signal-processing, data acquisition and display. Figure 4.7 illustrates 
a measuring chain for sensing in its simplest form with its basic terms and formulas.

Sensors for Dimensional Metrology and Kinematics 
These sensors transform the geometric input quantity length into an electrical output sig-
nal that can be displayed, stored or used for further applications. Kinematics deals with 
motion of an object in a frame of reference. In the commonly used Cartesian coordi-
nate system, the position of an object is described by the value set {x, y, z} of the three 
rectangular axes x, y, z in space. 
Any motion is composed of linear displacement (translation) or/and rotation along or 
around the three axes. The velocity v of an object is deﬁned as variation of position with 
time, e.g. vx = dx/dt. Acceleration a is deﬁned as variation of velocity with time, e.g. ax 
= dvx/dt = d2x/dt2. 
Sensing of kinematic parameters begins by describing the geometry of the system 
and declaring the initial values of the position set {x, y, z}. Sensors for kinematics are 
classiﬁed as 
• position sensors, 
• velocity sensor, 
• acceleration sensors. 
Position Sensing 
Position sensors are based on different physical principles to transform a geometric input, i.e. 
the position of an object to be determined, into electrical, magneto-electric or optoelectronic 
output signals, see Fig. 4.8.
Velocity Sensing 
The velocity v of a moving object is the rate of change of is positon s with time t, v = 
ds/dt. A measuring chain for determining the velocity of an object can be obtained by using 
the electrical output signal of a positon sensor as input to a differentiator which gives as 
output the velocity signal. The velocity measuring chain and the principle of an electronic 
differentiator are explained in Fig. 4.9.
Acceleration Sensing 
The principle of an accelerometer (also known as seismic acceleration sensor) is explained 
in Fig. 4.10. The acceleration a of an object (sensor input) is transformed with a spring-
damper-mass structure into a displacement x which gives via a displacement sensor an 
electrical signal as sensor output.

4.2.2
Sensors for Kinetics 
Kinetics is concerned with the relationship between motion and its causes, speciﬁed in 
Newton’s laws of classical mechanics: 
I. 
The ﬁrst law deﬁnes the force qualitatively: an object either remains at rest (sta-
tionary) or continues to move at a constant velocity v, unless acted upon by a 
force. 
II. The second law offers a quantitative measure of the force. The vector sum of the 
forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the 
acceleration a of the object: F = m · a. (It is assumed here that the mass m is 
constant.) 
III. The third asserts that a single isolated force doesn’t exist. When one body exerts 
a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in 
magnitude and opposite in direction on the ﬁrst body (actio = reactio principle). 
Force Sensors 
Force is a vector with a direction and a magnitude, it can only be determined by the response 
to its action. The design of force sensors utilizes the principles shown in Fig. 4.11.

Direct Force Sensors 
Direct force sensing is realized with piezo-electric sensors. They transform the input of 
a force directly in an output of electrical charge or electrical resistance as described in

Indirect Force Sensors 
The principles for indirect force sensing are illustrated in Fig. 4.13. A force acting on an 
elastic element causes displacement and strain. This lead to two types of force sensors. 
• Spring element force sensors, exempliﬁed as load cell in Fig. 4.14, and  
• Strain gages force sensors, exempliﬁed in Fig. 4.15.

Force Compensation Principle 
The force F to be measured is compensated by a force FC, created by an electromagnet as 
function of current I until the lever arm system is in balance, i.e. x = 0. At the balance 
position, FC is equal to F, and the current I is a measure of F, see Fig. 4.16.

Temperature Sensors 
Temperature T is a state variable of the heat contents of an object, it depends on location 
and time. Temperature sensors with an electrical signal output utilize the dependence 
of the electronic conductance or its reciprocal, the electrical resistance R(T) as physical 
sensor effect, or they are based as thermocouple on the Seebeck-Effect. The principles 
are explained in Fig. 4.17.

Embedded Sensors 
Embedded sensors detect “in situ” loads on the components of technical systems and 
transform them into electrical signal which can be used to control the structural integrity 
or the functional behavior of the component [4]. They are tied in the structural components 
of technical systems either by afﬁxing them with a glue (e.g. strain gages) or encase them 
in a component (e.g. ﬁber optical sensor). By adding an actuator network and a related 
control and drive system, the structure can be improved to a so-called “smart technical 
system”. The application of embedded sensors is exempliﬁed in Fig. 4.18. 
Embedded Sensor Technology for Infrastructure Safety 
“Infrastructure” is the set of fundamental facilities necessary for society and economy to 
function. Classical examples are supply and disposal facilities for energy and water as well 
as communication and transport networks. Infrastructure includes the physical components 
of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or 
enhance societal living conditions and maintain the surrounding environment. To improve 
the functionality and safety of public infrastructure, mechatronics—especially sensor tech-
nologies—have been utilized. A prominent example is Berlin’s completely new Central 
Station, Fig. 4.19 The German Television informed the public about the new application of 
advanced technology for infrastructure safety as follows:
Fig. 4.18 Application examples for embedded sensors

Mechatronic Systems
At Berlin’s new Central Station - one of the most complicated and complex buildings in 
Europe - a total of more than 200 sensors were embedded at all statically relevant struc-
tural components of the station. The sensors measure strains, deformations and settlements 
using different physical principles such as electrical, optical and mechanical transducers. The 
strain sensors for example, are attached directly to the building structure, where even the ﬁnest 
deformation can be registered by changing their electrical resistance of the sensor. Over 3000 
meter cables are laid through cavities to ensure the online monitoring of the entire construc-
tion. The collected signals are converted into physical units and processed further. A special 
developed computer program evaluates the condition data. Thus a current status picture of the 
station at particularly stressed locations can be called up at any time. This new dimension in 
structural safety has been carried out 2004 for the ﬁrst time at Berlin’s new Central Station.

Remote Sensing 
Wave propagation sensors for the determination of distance and speed operate with 
transmitted and reﬂected waves of different wavelength ranges, categorized as follows: 
RADAR (Radio detection and ranging) is an object-detection system that uses radio waves 
to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects. A radar system consists of a trans-
mitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwave domain, a transmitting 
antenna a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) 
and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object. Radio waves (pulsed 
or continuous) from the transmitter reﬂect off the object and return to the receiver, giving 
information about the object’s location. The velocity v of a moving object, e.g. the speed 
of a car, can be detected with the Doppler shift. 
LIDAR (Light detection and ranging) is a surveying method that measures distance to 
a target by illuminating that target with a pulsed laser light, and measuring the reﬂected 
pulses with a sensor. Differences in laser return times and wavelengths can then be used 
to measure distances. LIDAR uses Ultraviolet, Visible, or near Infrared light to image 
objects. It can target a wide range of materials, including non-metallic objects, rocks, 
and chemical compounds. A narrow laser-beam can map physical features with very high 
resolution. 
IR Sensors are device that forms an image using infrared radiation up to λ = 14 μm. 
This sensor technique can also be used for remote-sensing temperature. 
Ultrasonic Sensors evaluate targets by interpreting the reﬂected signals. For example, by 
measuring the time between sending a signal and receiving an echo, the distance of an 
object can be calculated. 
An overview of the physical principles of wave propagation sensors is given in 
Fig. 4.20.

Actuators in Mechatronic System 
An actuator (in short actor) is a component in a mechatronic system that is responsible for 
the functional output by which the system acts to fulﬁl its task [5]. An actuator requires 
a control signal and an electrical, ﬂuidic or thermal power supply. 
• Actuators with electric power supply 
– electric actuators, powered by a motor that converts electrical energy into mechan-
ical 
– galvanometer actuators produce a rotary deﬂection in an electro-magnetic ﬁeld 
– piezoelectric actuators, based on the inverse piezo-electrical effect 
• Actuators with ﬂuidic power supply 
– hydraulic actuators, consisting of a ﬂuid motor 
– pneumatic actuators, converting energy formed by vacuum or compressed air 
• Actuators with thermal power supply 
– bimetallic strip that converts a temperature change into mechanical displacement 
– shape-memory alloy, that switches between two crystal structures of different shape. 
The principles of actuators and the different types are illustrated in Fig. 4.21.

Their signiﬁcance has been expressed as follows:

tasks and types of mechatronic systems are very broad and include [2]:

4.4.1
Automobile Mechatronics 
Automobiles (cars) are a prominent category of mechatronic systems. Most cars are tra-
ditionally propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil 
fuels. An “electric car” is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, 
using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries. Automobiles are today mecha-
tronic systems with a broad variety of structural and functional modules and controls 
usually operated by the driver, see Fig. 4.24.

and ears as sensor, with his brain as processor, and with his muscles as actor 
Sensors in the Automobile 
From a technological point of view, virtually all parameters relevant for the road performance 
of an automobile, the safety and comfort of car passengers, and environment protection can 
be determined with appropriate sensors and controlled with mechatronic modules which 
include actuators and control algorithms. A selection of sensors for functional tasks in an 
automobile is shown in Fig. 4.25. The sensors are part of a mechatronic control system 
consisting of sensors, actuators, a bus (bidirectional universal switch) system and a central 
control and display unit.
Dynamic Stability Control 
Driving stability is of outmost importance for all automobiles—be they propelled by an 
internal combustion engine or by an electric motor, Dynamic stability control (DSC), also 
referred to as electronic stability program (ESP) is a mechatronic technology that improves 
a car’s driving stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). DSC estimates 
with sensors the direction of the skid, and then applies via actuators the brakes to individual 
wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle’s vertical axis, opposing 
the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver’s commanded direction (denoted 
as “target course set point” in Fig. 4.24). 
During normal driving, the dynamic stability control works in the background and con-
tinuously monitors steering and vehicle direction. The DSC module compares the driver’s 
intended direction xSP (determined through the measured steering wheel angle) to the vehi-
cle’s actual direction x (determined through measured lateral acceleration, vehicle rotation, 
and individual road wheel speeds). 
The principle of mechatronic dynamic stability control is explained in Fig. 4.26.

Industrial Robot 
Robots are a prominent category of mechatronic systems and indispensable today for 
industrial handling and production technologies [6]. They are automated, programmable 
and capable of movement on two or more axes. Instrumental for all these tasks is the 
mechatronic combination of mechanics, electronics, informatics and data mining with 
sensor technology. 
An overview of the basic feature of an industrial robot is given in Fig. 4.28 On the left, 
the general description of the function and the structure is given, according to the general 
system theory. A sketch of a robot as mechatronic system is shown on the right side of 
Fig. 4.28. The structure (S) of this mechatronic system is given by the robot components 
(A), their properties (P) and their motional interrelation (R). The robot function is the 
transfer (T) of operational inputs (X) into functional outputs (Y). Sensors, processors and

lower part of Fig.  4.28. 
4.4.3
Mechatronic Weighing System 
Weighing is an everyday procedure for all who sell or buy articles, food etc. by weight. In 
scientiﬁc terms, the weight W of a body is equal to the magnitude Fg of the gravitational 
force on the body: W = Fg = mg. It follows that m = Fg/g, where g is the gravitational

shown in Fig. 4.29. 
4.4.4
Wind Energy Converter 
Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth, driven by areas of high 
and low pressure. The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine, absorbing heat at higher 
temperatures, releasing heat at lower temperatures. Wind energy is the kinetic energy of 
air in motion E = 1/2 mv2. Power is energy per unit time, Wind power in an open air 
stream is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed. 
A Wind Energy Converter (or Wind Turbine) is a device that converts wind energy, 
ﬁrst with a rotor blade into mechanical energy, and then with an induction generator into 
electrical energy. The function of a Wind Energy Converter and its structural design is 
illustrated in Fig. 4.30, on the right, the process elements are named.
Wind is the “energy input”, necessary for the function of the wind turbine, but this is 
at the same time a “load” for the wind turbine structure. Loads can be classiﬁed as:
• Static loads (horizontal: mean wind and mean currents, vertical: gravity on non-rotating 
components)

96

Mechatronic Systems
Fig. 4.30 Wind energy converter and basic process elements
• Periodic loads (gravity on rotating components, regular waves, wind shear, tower 
disturbances, yaw errors) 
• Stochastic loads (irregular waves, turbulent wind) 
• Transient loads (turbine start-ups and shut- downs, gusts, extreme waves, meandering 
wakes of neighboring turbines). 
Performance monitoring is used for safeguarding the wind turbines. Standard techniques 
include: 
• Vibration analysis with focus on rotating components like bearings and wheels, based 
on different sensors (position, velocity, accelerometer) and speciﬁed for different 
frequencies and applied to shafts, bearings, gearbox, etc. 
• Strain measurements, utilizing electrical or ﬁber optic, aiming at structural monitoring 
for lifetime prediction and life cycle management 
• Thermography is a remote sensing technique to detect radiation in the long-infrared 
(IR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum (λ ≈ 9 … 4  μm). A thermographic cam-
era produces colored images of the radiation of an object. This allows, according to 
Planck’s law, a color-temperature mapping of the object, provided that the emissivity 
of the object is known. Figure 4.31 shows an application example: a thermogram of a 
wind turbine propeller, recorded with a helicopter.

MEMS and MOEMS 
Micro mechatronic systems are miniaturized mechatronic systems created by the meth-
ods and techniques of micro-technology. The terms “Micro electro-mechanical systems” 
(MEMS) and “Micro opto-electro-mechanical systems” (MOEMS) were coined for 
miniaturized items with moving parts. The general block diagram of micro mechatronic 
systems and the scaling requirements for sensors and actuators are shown in Fig. 4.32. 
In microscale mechatronics, MEMS and MOEMS are miniaturized actuators. The 
design of different micro actuators for MEMS is illustrated in Fig. 4.33. Conventional

electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motor’s magnetic ﬁeld 
and winding currents to generate force or torque. They can be downsized to dimensions 
of about two millimeters, as shown on the left of Fig. 4.33. Actuators with dimensions in 
the micrometer range can be achieved with electrostatic motors, an example is shown in 
the middle of Fig. 4.33. On the right of Fig. 4.33, the characteristic data of piezo actuators 
are shown. They are based on the “inverse” piezoelectric effect.

electrodes and electrostatic motors for the optical transmission and display of signals and 
data.

Smartphone Mechatronics 
Smartphones are multi-purpose information and communication devices. They are 
equipped with various mechatronic modules and sensors. An important sensor principle 
utilized for the tactile steering of smartphones is the capacitor principle, Fig. 4.35. 
A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a non-conductive region. A volt-
age V between the two conductors causes electric charges± Q and an electric ﬁeld. The 
capacitance C is deﬁned by C = Q/V. The capacitance changes if the distance between 
the plates or the overlap of the plates changes. 
• The capacity C of a distance sensor is inversely proportional to the input displacement 
d. 
• The capacity of a displacement sensor is directly proportional to the overlap of the 
capacitor plates. 
Capacitive touchscreen sensors consist of two transparent conductive traces of indium 
tin oxide (ITO), separated by a thin insulator, Fig. 4.36. The traces form a grid pattern 
with x–y coordinates. At the x–y intersections local capacitors arise coupled by electric 
ﬁelds. A ﬁnger (or conductive stylus) near the surface of the touchscreen changes the 
local electric ﬁeld and reduces the mutual capacitance.
When a ﬁnger hits the screen, a tiny electrical charge is transferred to the ﬁnger creat-
ing a voltage drop at the contact point on the screen. The processing unit detects the x–y 
location of this voltage drop. This signal is used as steering input for the panel. 
The application of a capacitor sensor for image positioning in smartphones is 
illustrated in Fig, 4.37.

Digital Camera 
Digital cameras are optical instruments used to record images. A camera captures light 
photons usually from the visual spectrum for human viewing, but in general could also 
be from other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. All cameras use the same basic 
design: light enters an enclosed box through a lens system and an image is recorded on 
a light-sensitive medium (sensor). A shutter mechanism controls the length of time that

light can enter the camera. A digital camera (or digicam) is a camera that encodes digital 
images and videos digitally and stores them for later reproduction. 
Key mechatronic modules are “Micro electro-mechanical systems” (MEMS) and “Mi-
cro opto-electro-mechanical systems” (MOEMS), see Sect. 4.5. They are responsible in 
digital cameras for optical image stabilization. Image stabilization (IS) is a technique that 
reduce blurring associated with the motion of a camera or other imaging device during 
exposure. Generally, it compensates for angular movement (yaw and pitch) of the imaging 
device. Mechatronic image stabilization can also compensate± 1° of rotation. The most 
common actuator is a galvanometer actuator. In combination with 
strong permanent magnets, two coils are 
used to drive a platform both vertically 
and horizontally. As this system inherently creates a strong magnetic ﬁeld, Hall positions 
sensors can be used to detect pitching and yawing. The actuators and position sensors can 
be tightly integrated in a small package, and work together in optical image stabilization, 
see Fig. 4.38. 
4.4.8
Inkjet Printer 
Micro piezo actuators are the basic mechatronic modules in inkjet printers. They are a 
type of printing that recreates a digital image by propelling droplets of ink onto paper with 
the drop-on-demand technique, DOD. Piezo printers use an actuator nozzle array with a 
miniaturized ink-ﬁlled chamber behind each nozzle. The printing principle is explained

in Fig. 4.39. In the suction phase (a), ink is taken into a chamber. In the rest phase (b), 
the chamber is ﬁlled with ink. When a voltage is applied, in the ejection phase (c), the 
piezoelectric actuator changes shape, generating a pressure pulse in the ﬂuid, which forces 
a droplet of ink from the nozzle. A DOD process uses software with an algorithm that 
directs the heads to apply between zero and eight droplets of ink per dot, only where 
needed. 
4.4.9
CD Player 
A CD player is a mechatronic device that plays audio compact discs which are a digital 
optical disc data storage format. A CD is made from 1.2 mm thick, polycarbonate plastic 
and weighs about 20 g. CD data is represented as tiny indentations (“pits”) encoded in 
a spiral track molded into the polycarbonate layer. The areas between pits are known as 
“lands”. 
The dimensions of a CD and a micrograph of the data track are shown in Fig. 4.40.
A CD is read by focusing a 780 nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor LASER 
housed within the CD player, through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change

and indicates a bit one, while no change indicates a series of zero bits. Figure 4.41 shows 
the principle of data retrieval.

on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track. 
An overview of the mechatronic modules needed for the functional performance of a 
CD player is given in Fig. 4.42. 
4.5
Nano-mechatronics 
A mechatronic device which operates at the nanoscale is the Scanning Tunneling 
Microscopy (STM), explained in Fig. 4.43. The STM is based on the physical effect 
of quantum tunneling. When a conducting tip is brought very near to the surface to be 
examined, a voltage applied between tip and surface can allow electrons to tunnel through 
the vacuum between them. The resulting tunneling current is a function of tip position. A 
surface topography imaging on the atomic scale is acquired by monitoring the current as 
the tip’s position scans with a piezo actuator across the surface, and is displayed in image

An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is an instrument for dimensional metrology of 
surface topography on the atomic scale. It detects repulsive forces on the nanometer scale 
by “feeling” or “touching” a surface with a mechanical probe. The design of an AFM is

a very soft cantilever with a spring constant in the range of 1 μmN/μm. The tip is scanned 
over the surface by a xyz piezo-actuator with a resolution of less than a nanometer. The 
displacement range is in the order of 10 μm in the z direction, and up to 150 μm in the  
lateral x- and y-directions.

Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 4.0 
Today’s technology developed—based on ﬁndings in the natural sciences, new materials 
and engineering innovations—in four major phases from the middle of the eighteenth 
century onwards: 
. Period 1: Industrial Revolution through the development of mechanical technologies 
with the help from steam engines (James Watt, 1769) and mechanical automation 
technology (e.g. Loom, 1785) 
– Mechanization 
. Period 2: Electro-mechanics by combining mechanical and electrical technologies 
(electric motor, generator, Siemens 1866) 
– Electriﬁcation 
. Period 3: Systems engineering combination of electro-mechanics with electronics, 
computer engineering, information technology and digitalization (1960s) 
– Mechatronics 
. Period 4: Combination of Mechatronics and the Internet of things (from 2000 on) 
– Cyber-physical systems (CPS), 
– Industry 4.0. 
The Technological Concept of Cyber-Physical Systems

Sciences ACATECH, (www.achatech.de) as follows:

Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 4.0
Fig. 5.1 The concept of cyber-physical systems 
. Cyber-physical systems are characterized by a combination of real (physical) objects and 
processes with information-processing (virtual) objects and processes via open, partly 
global and at all times connectable information networks. 
Cyber-physical systems merge mechatronics with cybernetics, design and process science 
and communication. The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, 
embedded with electronics, sensors, actuators, software, and network connectivity which 
enable these objects to collect and exchange data. 
CPS apply RFID (radio-frequency identiﬁcation) techniques to identify objects of interest 
and use sensors that collect physical data and act—with digital networks and actua-
tors—on production, logistics and engineering processes, whereby they utilize multimodal 
man–machine interfaces. The general scheme of cyber-physical systems consisting of the 
combination of mechatronics with an internet combination is shown in Fig. 5.1. 
The most critical success factor for the realization and introduction of cyber-physical pro-
duction systems is data, information and communication security. CPS networking creates 
security threats for industrial production with potential implications for functional safety 
aspects. Therefore, appropriate security architectures, protective measures and measures for 
the application of CPS and validation methods are required. 
CPSs are of relevance in such diverse industries as aerospace, automotive, energy, health-
care, manufacturing, infrastructure, consumer electronics, and communications [1]. An 
evolving cyber-physical systems landscape is anticipated for almost all areas of technology 
with the following examples [2]:

The Technological Concept of Industry 4.0 
The term Industry 4.0 denotes a multidisciplinary technology, which evolved in the begin-
ning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, to apply the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS) to 
industry [3]. Central aspect of industry 4.0 is the ability of machines, devices, and people 
to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of Things. Inter-connectivity

Cyber-Physical Systems and Industry 4.0
Fig. 5.2 The technological conception of Industry 4.0 
allows operators to collect data and information from all points in the manufacturing pro-
cess, thus aiding functionality. Industry 4.0 integrates processes in product development, 
manufacturing and service from suppliers to customers plus all key value chain partners. 
With the help of cyber-physical systems that monitor physical processes, a virtual copy 
of the physical world can be designed. The technological conception of industry 4.0 and 
their essential parts are illustrated in Fig. 5.2. 
a. Characterization of the physical elements of industry 4.0: products, structures, systems, 
processes 
b. Combination of physical elements to mechatronic systems with sensors, actuators, 
computers and control modules 
c. Extension of mechatronic systems to cyber-physical systems (CPS) and internet 
communication 
d. Cloud computing with available to many users over the Internet 
e. Digital services with webservers or mobile applications. 
Typical application areas of the concept of cyber-physical systems in industry 4.0 are [4]: 
Power engineering with CPS technologies for linking decentralized generation and dis-
tribution of electrical energy, in order to achieve an optimal, need-based and stable to 
ensure the functioning of energy networks (smart grids). 
Transport technology with networking of vehicles (“Car-to-X”) with each other or with 
the transport infrastructure via mobile radio. Cyber-physical systems will play a key role 
in future mobility, as they provide the basis for energy, battery and charging management. 
Product and production systems, which are controlled by CPS via component, plant, 
factory and company borders are networked with each other. This enables rapid produc-
tion according to individual customer requirements. Also, the production process within 
companies can be made more adaptive, evolutionary and cooperative through a network 
of worldwide self-organizing production units of different operators.

Systems Thinking in Health Technology 
Health technology is deﬁned by the World Health Organization as the “application of 
organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures, 
and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives”. 
Fundamental for the application of systems thinking in health technology are body 
functions and bio signals of the human body that can be recorded and therapeutically 
inﬂuenced [1]. 
A biosignal is any signal in living beings that can be continually measured and 
monitored, Fig. 6.1 gives an overview.
Biosignals characterize the medically relevant bodily functions of humans. They can 
be used with biosensor technology in systems diagnostics as functional variables (e.g. 
pressure, ﬂow velocity, acoustic noise, temperature, electrical potentials) and as struc-
tural characteristics of humans (e.g. skeleton structure, organ dimensions, volumes, bone 
elasticity). 
Biosignals are described—similar to signal functions in physics and technology—by 
signal shape, frequency, amplitude and the time of their occurrence. Their time response 
can be stationary, dynamic, periodic, discrete or stochastic. In medical technology appli-
cations, biosensors are combined with metrological components of signal processing and 
thus form a biological measurement chain, Fig. 6.2.
The technical systems of medical technology are medical devices: They are denoted 
in the EU Directive on Medical Devices (93/42/EEC) as follows: instruments, appara-
tus, substances or other objects which are used for the detection (diagnosis), prevention, 
surveillance (monitoring) and medical treatment (therapy) of human diseases or for the 
restoration of health (rehabilitation). 
Medical devices are mechatronic systems. They consist of mechanics/electronics/IT 
components and work with sensor/processor/actuator functional elements. In their medical

especially in diagnostics, monitoring and rehabilitation. In technological terms, medical 
equipment technology is extremely diverse and is divided into two major areas: 
. Body sensors for body functions, e.g. electro physical measurements of heart or brain 
functions, ECG, blood pressure sensors, 
. Imaging procedures, e.g. X-ray diagnostics, sonography (ultrasound diagnostics), 
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging.

Fig. 6.3 Systems thinking in health technology: biostimulation and biosensors for diagnosis and 
therapy, supported by a variety of technological procedures and equipment 
The application of medical technology by medical doctors is often associated with bios-
timulation, i.e. the application of stimuli, radiation, waves or medical substances to human 
test persons. This serves to improve the functionality of human sensory organs from the 
reaction to mechanical, acoustic, electrical, magnetic or visual stimuli. The determina-
tion of the resulting biosignals is carried out in a symptom analysis by biosensors using 
various methods: 
. Sonography enables the analysis of ultrasound reﬂexes in the human body, the repre-
sentation of movement sequences of heart valves and the measurement of blood ﬂow 
velocity. 
. X-ray absorption measurements allow the measurement of anatomical structures. 
. By means of radioactively marked substances, metabolic phenomena and the trans-
port speed, the accumulation site and the dynamics of precipitation processes can be 
determined. 
. Ergonomic measurements can be used to determine the physical load capacity. 
The principle of bioactuators and the interaction of biostimulation and biosensors is shown 
in a biological-mechatronic measuring chain in Fig. 6.3. The actual diagnostic ﬁndings 
are always provided by the responsible physician, supported by a variety of technological 
procedures and equipment.
