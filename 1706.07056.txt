Abstract: We propose an optimization procedure for Euclidean path-integrals that
evaluate CFT wave functionals in arbitrary dimensions. The optimization is per-
formed by minimizing certain functional, which can be interpreted as a measure of
computational complexity, with respect to background metrics for the path-integrals.
In two dimensional CFTs, this functional is given by the Liouville action. We also
formulate the optimization for higher dimensional CFTs and, in various examples,
ﬁnd that the optimized hyperbolic metrics coincide with the time slices of expected
gravity duals. Moreover, if we optimize a reduced density matrix, the geometry be-
comes two copies of the entanglement wedge and reproduces the holographic entan-
glement entropy. Our approach resembles a continuous tensor network renormaliza-
tion and provides a concrete realization of the proposed interpretation of AdS/CFT
as tensor networks. The present paper is an extended version of our earlier report
arXiv:1703.00456 and includes many new results such as evaluations of complexity
functionals, energy stress tensor, higher dimensional extensions and time evolutions
of thermoﬁeld double states.

Introduction
The AdS/CFT correspondence [1] has been the most powerful tool to understand
quantum nature of gravity. Nevertheless, we still do not understand its basic mecha-
nism nor how spacetime in gravity emerges from conformal ﬁeld theories (CFTs). Re-
cently, possible candidates which might explain the basic mechanism of the AdS/CFT
correspondence have begun to be actively investigated. Among them, a very attrac-
tive candidate is the idea of emergent spacetimes from tensor networks, as ﬁrst
conjectured by Swingle [2], for the description of CFT states in terms of MERA
(multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz) [3]1. One strong evidence for this
correspondence between holography and tensor networks, apart from the symmetry
considerations, is the fact that the holographic entanglement entropy formula [13, 14]
can naturally be explained in this approach by counting the number of entangling
links in the networks.
However, up to now, most arguments in these directions have been limited to
studies of discretized lattice models so that we can apply the idea of tensor networks
directly. Therefore, they at most serve as toy models of AdS/CFT as they do not
describe the genuine CFTs which are dual to the AdS gravity (though they provide us

with deep insights of holographic principle such as quantum error corrections [8, 15]).
Clearly, it is then very important to develop a continuous analogue of tensor networks
related to AdS/CFT. There already exists a formulation called cMERA (continuous
MERA) [4], whose connection to AdS/CFT has been explored in [6, 7, 10, 12, 16].
Nevertheless, explicit formulations of cMERA are so far only available for free ﬁeld
theories [4] (see [6, 17, 18] for various studies) which is the opposite regime from
the strongly interacting CFTs which possess gravity duals, the so-called holographic
CFTs. A formal construction of cMERA for general CFTs can be found in [12, 16].
The main aim of this work is to introduce and explore a new approach which
realizes a continuous limit of tensor networks and allows for ﬁeld theoretic compu-
tations. In our preceding letter version [19], we gave a short summary of our idea
and its application to two dimensional (2D) CFTs. Essentially, we reformulate the
conjectured relation between tensor networks and AdS/CFT from the viewpoint of
Euclidean path-integrals. Indeed, the method called tensor network renormalization
(TNR) [20] shows that an Euclidean path-integral computation of a ground state
wave function can be regarded as a tensor network description of MERA. In this
argument, one ﬁrst discretizes the path-integral into a lattice version and rewrites
it as a tensor network. Then, an optimization by contracting tensors and removing
unnecessary lattice sites, ﬁnally yields the MERA network. The ‘optimization’ here
refers to some eﬃcient numerical algorithm.
In our approach we will reformulate this idea, but in such a way that we re-
main working with the Euclidean path-integral.
More precisely, we perform the
optimization by changing the structure (or geometry) of lattice regularization. The
ﬁrst attempt in this direction was made in [12] by introducing a position dependent
UV cut oﬀ. In this work, we present a systematic formulation of optimization by
introducing a metric on which we perform the path-integral. The scaling down of
this metric corresponds to the optimization assuming that there is a lattice site on
a unit area cell.
To evaluate the amount of optimization we made, we consider a functional IΨ of
the metric for each quantum state |Ψ⟩. This functional, which might appropriately
be called “Path-integral Complexity”, describes the size of our path-integration and
corresponds to the computational complexity in the equivalent tensor network de-
scription2. In 2D CFTs, we can identify this functional IΨ with the Liouville action.
The optimization procedure is then completed by minimizing this complexity func-
2The relevance of computational complexity in holography was recently pointed out and holo-
graphic complexity was conjectured to be the volume of maximal time slice in gravity duals [21, 22]
(for recent progresses see e.g. [23–27]) and the gravity action in Wheeler-De Witt patch in [28, 29]
(for recent progresses see e.g.[30–38]). We would also like to mention that for CFTs, the behavior
of the complexity is very similar to the quantum information metric under marginal deformations
as pointed out in [39] (refer to [23, 27, 40] for recent developments), where the metric is argued to
be well approximated by the volume of maximal time slice in AdS.

tional IΨ, and we argue that the minimum value of IΨ is a candidate for complexity
of a quantum state in CFTs. Below, we will perform a systematic analysis of our
complexity functional for various states in 2D CFTs, lower dimensional example of
NAdS2/CFT1 (SYK) as well as in higher dimensions, where we will ﬁnd an interest-
ing connection to the gravity action proposal [28, 29].
Our new path-integral approach has a number of advantages. Firstly, we can di-
rectly deal with any CFTs, including holographic ones, as opposed to tensor network
approaches which rely on lattice models of quantum spins. Secondly, in the tensor
network description there is a subtle issue that the MERA network can also be in-
terpreted as a de Sitter space [5, 9], while the reﬁned tensor networks given in [8, 11]
are argued to describe Euclidean hyperbolic spaces. In our Euclidean approach we
can avoid this issue and explicitly verify that the emergent space coincides with a
hyperbolic space, i.e. the time slice of AdS.
This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we present our formulation of an
optimization of Euclidean path-integrals in CFTs and relate to the analysis of com-
putational complexity and tensor network renormalization. We will also start with
an explicit example for a vacuum of a 2D CFT. In section 3, we will investigate the
optimization procedure in 2D CFTs for more general states such as ﬁnite tempera-
ture states and primary states. In section 4, we apply our optimization procedure
to reduced density matrices. We show that the holographic entanglement entropy
and entanglement wedge naturally arise from this computation. In section 5, we
will study the energy stress tensor of our 2D CFTs in the optimization analysis. In
section 6, we explicitly evaluate the Liouville action for the optimized solutions and
point out that, due to the conformal anomaly, we need to consider a diﬀerence of
Liouville action, which corresponds to a relative complexity. In section 7, we apply
our optimization to one dimensional nearly conformal quantum mechanics like SYK
models. In section 8, propose and provide various support for generalization of our
optimization to higher dimensional CFTs. We also compare our results with existing
literature of holographic complexity. In section 9, we discuss the time evolution of
thermo-ﬁeld dynamics in 2D CFTs as an example of time-dependent states. Finally,
in section 10 we summarize our ﬁndings and conclude. In appendix A, we com-
ment on the connection of our approach to an earlier work on the relation between
the Liouville theory and 3D gravity. In appendix B, we give a brief summary of
the results on holographic complexity in literature, focusing on CFT vacuum states.
In appendix C, we study the properties of complexity functional in the presence of
higher derivatives and in appendix D, we discuss connections between entanglement
entropy and Liouville ﬁeld.

Formulation of the Path-Integral Optimization
Here we introduce our idea of optimization of Euclidean path-integrals, which was
ﬁrst presented in our short letter [19]. We consider a discretized version of Euclidean
path-integral which produces a quantum wave functional in QFTs, having in mind
a numerical computation of path-integrals.
The UV cut oﬀ(lattice constant) is
written as ϵ throughout this paper. The optimization here means the most eﬃcient
procedure to perform the path-integral in its discretized form3. In other words, it is
the most eﬃcient algorithm to numerically perform the path-integrals which leads
to the correct wave functional.
2.1
General Formulation
We can express the ground state wave functional in a d dimensional QFT on Rd in
terms of a Euclidean path-integral as follows:
Ψ0[ ˜ϕ(x)] =
Z  Y
x
Y
ϵ≤z<∞
Dϕ(z, x)
!
e−SQF T (ϕ) ×
Y
x
δ(ϕ(ϵ, x) −˜ϕ(x)).
(2.1)
Here we write the coordinate of Rd as (z, x), where −z(≡τ) is the Euclidean time
and x is the d−1 dimensional space coordinate of Rd−1. We set z = ϵ at the ﬁnal time
when the path-integral is completed for our convenience. However, we can shift this
value as we like without changing our results as is clear from the time translational
invariance. Now we perform our discretization of path-integral in terms of the lattice
constant ϵ. We start with the square lattice discretization as depicted in the left
picture of Fig.1. To optimize the path-integral we can omit any unnecessary lattice
sites from our evaluation. Since only the low energy mode k ≪1/τ survives after
the path-integral for the period τ, we can estimate that we can combine O(τ/ϵ)
lattice sites into one site without losing so much accuracy. It is then clear that the
optimization via this coarse-graining procedure leads to the middle picture in Fig.1,
which coincides with the hyperbolic plane.
One useful way to systematically quantify such coarse-graining procedures is to
introduce a metric on the d dimensional space (z, x) (on which the path integration
is performed) such that we arrange one lattice site for a unit area. In this rule, we
can write the original ﬂat space metric before the optimization as follows:
ds2 = 1
ϵ2 ·
 
dz2 +
d−1
X
i=1
dxidxi
!
.
(2.2)
Consider now the optimization procedure in this metric formulation. The basic rule
is to require that the optimized wave functional Ψopt is proportional to the correct
3Please distinguish our optimization from other totally diﬀerent procedures such as the opti-
mization of parameter of tensors in tensor networks. Instead, as we will see later in this section,
our optimization changes the tensor network structures as in tensor network renormalization [20].

ground state wave function (i.e. the one (2.1) for the metric (2.2) ) even after the
optimization i.e. Ψopt[ϕ(x)] ∝Ψ0[ϕ(x)]. The optimization can then be realized by
modifying the background metric for the path-integration
ds2 =gzz(z, x)dz2 + gij(z, x)dxidxj + 2gzj(z, x)dzdxj,
gzz(z =ϵ, x) = ϵ−2,
gij(z = ϵ, x) = δij · ϵ−2,
giz(z = ϵ, x) = 0,
(2.3)
where the last constraints argue that the UV regularization agrees with the original
one (2.2) at the end of the path-integration (as we need to reproduce the correct
wave functional after the optimization).
In conformal ﬁeld theories, because there are no coupling RG ﬂows, we should be
able to complete the optimization only changing the background metric as in (2.3).
However, in non-conformal ﬁeld theories, actually we need to modify external ﬁelds
J (such as mass parameter or other couplings of various interactions) in a position
dependent way J(z, x). The same is true for CFT states in the presence of external
ﬁelds.
To ﬁnalize the optimization procedure, we should provide a suﬃcient condition
for the metric to be ”maximally” optimized. Thus, we assume that for each quantum
state |Ψ⟩, there exists a functional IΨ[gab(z, x)] whose minimization with respect to
the metric gab gives such maximal optimization4. In this way, once we know the
functional IΨ, we can ﬁnalize our optimization procedure. As we will see shortly, in
2D CFTs we can explicit identify this functional IΨ[gab(z, x)].
4In non-conformal ﬁeld theories or in the presence of external ﬁelds in CFTs, this functional
depends on gauge ﬁelds for global currents and scalar ﬁelds etc. as I [gab(z, x), Aa(z, x), J(z, x), ...].

2.2
Connection to Computational Complexity
At an intuitive level, the optimization corresponds to minimizing the number of path-
integral operations in the discretized description. As we will explain in subsection
2.4, we can map this discretized Euclidean path-integration into a tensor network
computation. Tensor networks are a graphical description of wave functionals in
quantum many-body systems in terms of networks of quantum entanglement (see
e.g.[41, 42]). The optimization of tensor network was introduced in [20], called ten-
sor network renormalization. We are now considering a path-integral counterpart
of the same optimization here. In the tensor network description, the optimization
corresponds to minimizing the number of tensors. We can naturally identify this min-
imized number as a computational complexity of the quantum state we are looking
at.
Let us brieﬂy review the relevant facts about the computational complexity of a
quantum state (for example, see [43–46]). In quantum information theory, a quantum
state made of qubits can be constructed by a sequence of simple unitary operations
acting on a simple reference state. The sequence is called a quantum circuit and
the unitary operations are called quantum gates. As a simple choice, we use 2-qubit
gates for simple unitary operations and a direct product state for a simple state which
has no real space entanglement (Fig.2). The quantum circuit (gate) complexity of
Figure 2: A quantum circuit representation for a quantum state in a qubit system.
A quantum state |Ψ⟩can be constructed by simple local (2-qubit) unitary operations
from a simple reference state, for example, a product state |0⟩|0⟩|0⟩· · · .
a quantum state is then deﬁned as a minimal number of the quantum gates needed
to create the state starting from a reference state. Because the quantum circuit is a
model of quantum computation, here we refer to the complexity as the computational
complexity 5.
5The relevance of computational complexity in AdS/CFT was recently pointed out and holo-
graphic computations of complexity have been proposed in [21, 22, 28, 29]
– 6 –

Based on the above considerations as well as the evidence provided in the follow-
ing section, we are naturally lead to a conjecture that a computational complexity CΨ
of a state |Ψ⟩is obtained from the functional introduced before by a minimization:
CΨ = Mingab(z,x) [IΨ[gab(z, x)]] .
(2.4)
In other words, the functional IΨ[gab(z, x)] for any gab(z, x) estimates the amount of
complexity for that network corresponding to the (partially optimized) path-integral
on the space with the speciﬁed metric.
Understanding of the properties of this
complexity functional IΨ, which might appropriately be called “Path-integral Com-
plexity”, is the central aim of this work. As we will soon see, this functional will be
closely connected to the mechanism of emergent space in the AdS/CFT.
2.3
Optimization of Vacuum States in 2D CFTs
Let us ﬁrst see how the optimization procedure works for vacuum states in 2D CFTs.
We will study more general states later in later sections.
In 2D CFTs, we can always make the general metric into the diagonal form via
a coordinate transformation. Thus the optimization is performed in the following
ansatz:
ds2 = e2φ(z,x)(dz2 + dx2),
e2φ(z=ϵ,x) = 1/ϵ2,
(2.5)
where the second condition speciﬁes the boundary condition so that the discretization
is ﬁne-grained when we read oﬀthe wave function after the full path-integration. Ob-
viously this is a special example of the ansatz (2.3). Thus the metric is characterized
by the Weyl scaling function φ(z, x).
Remarkably, in 2D CFTs, we know how the wave function changes under such
a local Weyl transformation. Keeping the universal UV cut oﬀϵ, the measure of the
path-integrations of quantum ﬁelds in the CFT changes under the Weyl rescaling
[47]:
[Dϕ]gab=e2φδab = eSL[φ]−SL[0] · [Dϕ]gab=δab,
(2.6)
where SL[φ] is the Liouville action6 [48] (see also [47, 49])
SL[φ] =

24π
Z ∞
−∞
dx
Z ∞
ϵ


(∂xφ)2 + (∂zφ)2 + µe2φ
.
(2.7)
The constant c is the central charge of the 2D CFT we consider. The kinetic term
in SL represents the conformal anomaly and the potential term arises the UV regu-
larization which manifestly breaks the Weyl invariance. In our treatment, we simply
set µ = 1 below by suitable shift of φ.
6Here we take the reference metric is ﬂat ds2 = dz2 + dx2. Later in section (6), we will present
the Liouville action for a more general reference metric.
– 7 –

Therefore, the wave functional Ψgab=e2φδab( ˜ϕ(x)) obtained from the Euclidean
path-integral for the metric (2.5) is proportional to the one Ψgab=δab( ˜ϕ(x)) for the
ﬂat metric (2.2) thanks to the conformal invariance. The proportionality coeﬃcient
is given by the Liouville action as follows7
Ψgab=e2φδab( ˜ϕ(x)) = eSL[φ]−SL[0] · Ψgab=δab( ˜ϕ(x)).
(2.8)
Let us turn to the optimization procedure. As proposed in [19], we argue that
the optimization is equivalent to minimizing the normalization factor eSL[φ] of the
wave functional, or equally the complexity functional IΨ0 for the vacuum state |Ψ0⟩
in 2D CFTs, can be identiﬁed as follows8
IΨ0[φ(z, x)] = SL[φ(z, x)].
(2.9)
The intuitive reason is that this factor is expected to be proportional to the number
of repetition of the same operation (i.e. the path-integral in one site). In 2D CFTs,
we believe this is only one quantity which we can come up with to measure the size of
path-integration. Indeed it is proportional to the central charge, which characterizes
the degrees of freedom.
Thus the optimization can be completed by requiring the equation of motion of
Liouville action SL and this reads
4∂w∂¯wφ = e2φ,
(2.10)
where we introduced w = z + ix and ¯w = z −ix.
With the boundary condition e2φ(z=ϵ,x) = ϵ−2, we can easily ﬁnd the suitable
solution to (2.10):
e2φ =
4
(w + ¯w)2 = z−2,
(2.11)
which leads to the hyperbolic plane metric
ds2 = dz2 + dx2
z2
.
(2.12)
This justiﬁes the heuristic argument to derive a hyperbolic plane H2 in Fig.1.
Indeed, this hyperbolic metric is the minimum of SL with the boundary condi-
tion. To see this, we rewrite

7 Here we compare the optimized metric gab = e2φδab with gab = δab. To be exact we need to
take the latter to be the original one (2.2) i.e. gab = ϵ−2δab. However the diﬀerent is just a constant
factor multiplication and does not aﬀect our arguments. So we simply ignore this.
8In two dimensional CFTs, as we will explain in section 6, due to the conformal anomaly we
actually need to deﬁne a relative complexity by the diﬀerence of the Liouville action between two
diﬀerent metrics. However this does not change out argument in this section.

where L ≡
R
dx is the length of space direction and we assume the IR behavior
e2φ(z=∞,x) = 0. The ﬁnal inequality in (2.13) is saturated if and only if
∂xφ = ∂zφ + eφ = 0,
(2.14)
and this leads to the solution (2.11).
In this way, we observe that the time slice of AdS3 dual to the 2D CFT vacuum
emerges after the optimization.
We will see more evidences throughout this pa-
per that geometries obtained from our optimization coincides with the time slice in
AdS/CFT. This is consistent with the idea of tensor network description of AdS/CFT
and can be regarded as its continuous version. We would like to emphasize that the
above argument only depends on the central charge c of the 2D CFT we consider.
Therefore this should be applied to both free and interacting CFTs including holo-
graphic ones.
It is also interesting to note that the optimized value of SL, i.e. our complexity
CΨ0, scales linearly with respect to the momentum cut oﬀϵ−1 and the central charge
c as
CΨ0 = Minφ[SL[φ]] =
cL
12πϵ,
(2.15)
and this qualitatively agrees with the behavior of the computational complexity
[21, 22] of a CFT ground state and the quantum information metric [39] for the same
state, both of which are given by the volume of time slice of AdS. In this relation, our
minimization of SL nicely corresponds to the optimization of the quantum circuits
which is needed to deﬁne the complexity.
2.4
Tensor Network Renormalization and Optimization
As argued in our preceding letter [19] (see also [12]), our identiﬁcation of the Liouville
action with a complexity i.e.(2.9) is partly motivated by an interesting connection
between the tensor network renormalization (TNR) [20] and our optimization proce-
dure of Euclidean path-integral. This is because the number of tensors in TNR is an
estimation of complexity and the Liouville action has a desired property in this sense,
e.g. it is obvious that the Liouville potential term
R
e2φ (i.e. the volume) measures
the number of unitary tensors in TNR. Soon later this argument was sharpened in
the quite recent paper [51] where the number of isometries is argued to explain the
kinetic term
R
(∂φ)2 in Liouville theory.
An Euclidean path-integral on a semi-inﬁnite plane (or cylinder) with a boundary
condition on the edge gives us a ground state wave functional in a quantum system.
The path-integral can be approximately described by a tensor network which is a
collection of tensors contracted with each other. Using the Suzuki-Torotter decom-
position [50] and the singular value decomposition of the tensors, we can rewrite the
Euclidean path-integral into a tensor network on a square lattice (Fig.3). Tensor
network renormalization (TNR) is a procedure to reorganize the tensors to ones on a

can be approximately described by a tensor network on a square lattice.
coarser lattice by inserting projectors (isometries) and unitaries (disentanglers) with
removing short-range entanglement.9 This is a step of TNR (Fig.4). Repeating this
procedure, we can generate a RG ﬂow properly and end up with a tensor network
at the IR ﬁxed point. For the ground state wave functional in a CFT, it ends up
with a MERA (Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz) network made of
isometries and disentanglers. The MERA network clearly contains smaller numbers
of the tensors than ones in the tensor network on the original square lattice before
the coarse-graing. In this sense, this MERA network is an optimal tensor network
to approximately describe the Euclidean path-integral.
Our optimization procedure is motivated by TNR. In our procedure (Fig.1), the
tensor network on the square lattice corresponds to the Euclidean path-integral on
ﬂat space with a UV cutoﬀϵ. Changing the tensor network with inserting isome-
tries and entanglers corresponds to deforming the back-ground metric for the path-
integral. And the MERA network, which is the tensor network after the TNR pro-
cedure, approximately corresponds to the optimized path-integral.
Actually, it is not diﬃcult to estimate the amount of complexity for each ten-
sor network during the TNR optimization procedure, by identifying the complexity
with the number of tensors, both isometries (coarse-graining) and unitaries (dis-
entanglers).
For simplicity, consider an Euclidean path-integral for the ground
state wave function in a 2d CFT, which is performed on the upper half plane
(ϵ < z < ∞, −∞< x < +∞). First we consider the original square lattice. Since we
suppose that each tensor have unit area, the uniform metric is given by e2φ(z) = ϵ−2
as in (2.2).
Therefore, the total number of tensors, which are only unitaries, is
estimated from the total volume:

lattice sites is reduced by the factor (1/2)2 per step. On the other hand, the isometries
and disentanglers accumulate from the UV boundary [20]. Refer to Fig.4.

Optimizing Various States in 2D CFTs
Here we would like to explore optimizations in 2D CFTs for more general quantum
states.
First it is useful to remember that the general solutions to the Liouville
equation (2.10) is well-known (see e.g.[47, 52]):
e2φ =
4A′(w)B′( ¯w)
(1 −A(w)B( ¯w))2.
(3.1)
Note that functions A(w) and B( ¯w) describe the degrees of freedom of conformal
mappings. For example, if we choose
A(w) = w,
B( ¯w) = −1/ ¯w,
(3.2)
then we reproduce the solution for vacuums states (2.11).
3.1
Finite Temperature States
Consider a 2D CFT state at a ﬁnite temperature T = 1/β. In the thermoﬁeld double
description [53], the wave functional is expressed by an Euclidean path-integral on
a strip deﬁned by −β

where ˜ϕ1(x) and ˜ϕ2(x) are the boundary values for the ﬁelds of the CFT (i.e. ˜ϕ(x))
at z = ∓β

Minimizing the Liouville action SL leads to the solution in (3.2) given by:

(3.7)
which coincides with the time slice of eternal BTZ black hole (i.e. the Einstein-Rosen
bridge) [53].
3.2
CFT on a Cylinder and Primary States
Now consider 2D CFTs on a cylinder (with the circumference 2π), where the wave
functional is deﬁned on a circle |w| = 1 at a ﬁxed Euclidean time. After the opti-
mization procedure, we obtain the geometry A(w) = w and B( ¯w) = ¯w given by
e2φ(w, ¯w) =
4
(1 −|w|2)2,
(3.8)
which is precisely the Poincare disk and is the solution to (2.10).
Then we consider an excited state given by a primary state |α⟩. This is created
by acting a primary operator Oα(w, ¯w) with the conformal dimension hα = ¯hα at the
center w = ¯w = 0. Its behavior under the Weyl re-scaling is expressed as
O(w, ¯w) ∝e−2hαφ.
(3.9)
Thus the dependence of the wave function on φ looks like
Ψgab=e2φδab( ˜ϕ) ≃eSL · e−2hαφ(0) · Ψgab=δab( ˜ϕ).
(3.10)
This shows that the complexity function should be taken to be
Iα[φ(w, ¯w)] = SL[φ(w, ¯w)] −2hαφ(0).
(3.11)
The equation of motion of Iα leads to
4∂w∂¯wφ −e2φ + 2π(1 −a)δ2(w) = 0,
(3.12)
where we set
a = 1 −12hα
c
.
(3.13)
The solution can be found as
A(w) = wa,
B( ¯w) = ¯wa,
(3.14)
– 13 –

which leads to the expression:
e2φ =
4a2
|w|2(1−a)(1 −|w|2a)2.
(3.15)
Since the angle of w coordinate is 2π periodic, this geometry has the deﬁcit angle
2π(1 −a).
Now we compare this geometry with the time slice of the gravity dual predicted
from AdS3/CFT2. It is given by the conical deﬁcit angle geometry (3.15) with the
identiﬁcation
a =
r
1 −24hα
c
.
(3.16)
Thus, the geometry from our optimization (3.13) agrees with the gravity dual (3.16)
up to the ﬁrst order correction when hα ≪c, i.e. the case where the back-reaction
due to the point particle is very small.
It is intriguing to note that if we consider the quantum Liouville theory rather
than the classical one, we ﬁnd the perfect matching.
In the quantum Liouville
theory, we introduce a parameter γ such that c = 1+3Q2 and Q ≡2
γ +γ. The chiral
conformal dimension of the primary operator e
2β
γ φ is given by β(Q−β)
2
. If the central
charge is very large so that the 2D CFT has a classical gravity dual, we ﬁnd
a ≃1 −βγ ≃
r
1 −24hα
c
,
(3.17)
which indeed agrees with the gravity dual (3.16) even when hα/c is ﬁnite.
This agreement may suggest that the actual optimized wave functional is given
by a ‘quantum’ optimization deﬁned as follows:
Ψopt[ ˜ϕ] =
Z
Dφ(x, z)e−SL[φ] (Ψgab=δab[ ˜ϕ])−1
−1
.
(3.18)
If we take the semi-classical approximation when c is large, we reproduce our classical
optimization. It is an important future problem to understand the exact for of the
proposal at the quantum level.
3.3
Liouville Equation and 3D AdS Gravity
In the above we have seen that the minimizations of Liouville action, which corre-
sponds to the optimization of Euclidean path-integrals in CFTs, lead to hyperbolic
metrics which ﬁt nicely with canonical time slices of bulk AdS in various setups
of AdS3/CFT2. If this derivation of time slice metric in AdS3 really explains the
mechanism of emergence of AdS in AdS/CFT, it should ﬁt nicely with the dynamics
of AdS gravity for the whole 3D space-time. One natural coordinate system in 3D
gravity for our argument is as follows
ds2 = R2
AdS
 dρ2 + cosh2 ρ · e2φdyd¯y

.
(3.19)
– 14 –

Indeed the Einstein equation Rµν +
2
R2
AdS gµν = 0 is equivalent to the equation of
motion in the Liouville theory: 4∂y∂¯yφ = e2φ.
It is also useful to remember that connections between Liouville theory and 3D
AdS gravity were discussed in earlier papers [54–61] (refer to [62] for a review).
Especially the direct connection between the equation of motion in the SL(2, R)
Chern-Simons gauge theory description of AdS gravity [63] and that of Liouville
theory was found in [56] (see also closely related arguments [57–60]).
Indeed, we can ﬁnd a coordinate transformation which maps the metric (3.19)
into the one from [56], where the map gets trivial only in the near boundary limit
ρ →∞. This shows that we can identify these two appearances of Liouville theory
from 3D AdS gravity by a non-trivial bulk coordinate transformation. We presented
the details of this transformation in the appendix A.
Notice also that we did not ﬁx the overall normalization of the optimized metric
or equally the AdS radius RAdS because in our formulation it depends on the precise
deﬁnition of UV cut oﬀ. However, we can apply the argument of [12] for the sym-
metric orbifold CFTs and can heuristically argue that RAdS is proportional to the
central charge c. This is deeply connected to the fact that we ﬁnd the sub AdS scale
locality in gravity duals of holographic CFTs.

Reduced Density Matrices and EE
Consider an optimization of path-integral representation of reduced density matrix
ρA in a two dimensional CFT deﬁned on a plane R2. We simply choose the subsystem
A to be an interval −l ≤x ≤l at z(= −τ) = ϵ. ρA is deﬁned from the CFT vacuum
by tracing out the complement of A (the upper left picture in Fig.6).
4.1
Optimizing Reduced Density Matrices
The optimization procedure is performed by changing the background metric as in
(2.5), where the boundary condition of φ is imposed around the upper and lower
edge of the slit A. Refer to Fig.6 for a sketch of this procedure. The plane R2 is
conformally mapped into a sphere S2. Therefore the optimization is done by shrinking
the sphere with an open cut down to a much smaller one so that the Liouville action
is minimized.
To make the analysis clear, let us divide the ﬁnal manifold into two halves by
cutting along the horizontal line z = 0, denoted by Σ+ and Σ−. The boundary of
Σ± consist of two parts:
∂Σ± = A± ∪ΓA,
(4.1)
where ΓA in both ∂Σ+ and ∂Σ−are identiﬁed so that the topology of the ﬁnal
optimized manifold Σ+ ∪Σ−is a disk with the boundary A+ ∪A−. On the boundary
A+ ∪A−we have e2φ = 1/ϵ2.

Figure 6: The optimization of path-integral for a reduced density matrix.
The
upper left picture is the deﬁnition of ρA in terms of the path-integral in ﬂat space.
This is conformally mapped into a sphere with a open cut depicted in the lower left
picture. The upper right one is the one after the optimization and is equivalent to a
geometry which is obtained by pasting two identical entanglement wedges along the
geodesic (=the half circle) as shown in the lower right picture.
The optimization of each of Σ± is done by minimizing the Liouville action with
boundary contributions. The boundary action in the Liouville theory [64] reads
SLb =
c
12π
Z
∂Σ±
ds[K0φ + µBeφ],
(4.2)
where K0 is the (trace of) extrinsic curvature of the boundary ∂Σ± in the ﬂat space.
If we describe the boundary by x = f(z), then the extrinsic curvature in the ﬂat
metric ds2 = dz2 + dx2, is given by K0 = −
f′′
(1+(f′)2)3/2. On the other hand, the ﬁnal
term is the boundary Liouville potential. Since Σ+ and Σ−are pasted along the
boundary smoothly, we set µB = 0 for our ρA optimization.10
Now, to satisfy the equation of motion at the boundary ΓA, we impose the
Neumann boundary condition11 of φ. This condition (when µB = 0) is explicitly
written as
(nx∂x + nz∂z)φ + K0 = 0.
(4.3)
where nx,z is the unit vector normal to the boundary in the ﬂat space. Actually this
is simply expressed as K = 0, where K is the extrinsic curvature in the curved metric
(2.5). This fact can be shown as follows. Consider a boundary x = f(z) in the two
dimensional space deﬁned by the metric ds2 = e2φ(z,x)(dz2 + dx2). The out-going
normal unit vector N a is given by
N z = e−φ(z,x)nz = −f ′(z)e−φ(z,x)
p
1 + f ′(z)2 ,
N x = e−φ(z,x)nx =
e−φ(z,x)
p
1 + f ′(z)2,
(4.4)
10Non-zero µB leads to a jump of the extrinsic curvature which will be used later.
11On the cuts A± we imposed the Dirichlet boundary condition. The reason why we imposed the
Neumann one on ΓA is simply because the manifold is smoothly connected to the other side on ΓA.
– 16 –

where na is the normal unit vector in the ﬂat space ds2 = dz2 + dx2. The extrinsic
curvature (=its trace part) at the boundary is deﬁned by K = hab∇aNb, where all
components are projected to the boundary whose induced metric is written as hab.
Explicitly we can calculate K as follows:
K =
e−φ(z,x)

∂xφ −f ′∂zφ −
f ′′
1 + (f ′)2

= e−φ(z,x) [na∂aφ + K0] .
(4.5)
In this way, the Neumann boundary condition requires that the curve ΓA is
geodesic. By taking the bulk solution given by the hyperbolic space φ = −log z+const.,
the geodesic ΓA is given by the half circle z2 +x2 = l2. Thus, this geometry obtained
from the optimization of ρA, coincides with (two copies of) the entanglement wedge
[13, 14, 65–67].
Note that if we act a local operator inside the entanglement wedge in the original
ﬂat space, then this excitation survives after the optimization procedure. However, if
we act the operator outside, then the excitation is washed out under the optimization
procedure and does not reﬂect the reduced density matrix ρA as long as we neglect
its back-reaction.
4.2
Entanglement Entropy
Next we evaluate the entanglement entropy by the replica method.
Consider an
optimization of the matrix product ρn
A. We assume an analytical continuation of
n with |n −1| ≪1. The standard replica method leads to a conical deﬁcit angle
2π(1−n) ≡2δ at the two end points of the interval A. Thus, after the optimization,
we get a geometry with the corner angle π/2+π(n−1) instead of π/2 (the lower right
picture in Fig. 7). This modiﬁcation of the boundary ΓA is equivalent to shifting the
extrinsic curvature from K = 0 to K = π(n−1). Indeed, if we consider the boundary
given by x2+(z−z0)2 = l2, we get K = z0/l. When z0 is inﬁnitesimally small, we get
x ≃l+(z0/l)·z +O(z2) near the boundary point (z, x) = (0, l). Therefore the corner
angle is shifted to be π/2−δ with δ ≃−z0/l (for the deﬁnition of δ, refer also to lower
pictures in Fig.7). Therefore we ﬁnd the relation K ≃−δ. If we set the boundary
Liouville term in (4.2) non-zero µB ̸= 0, the boundary condition is modiﬁed from
(4.3) i.e. K = 0 into K + µB = 0. Thus the desired angle shift (or negative deﬁcit
angle) is realized by setting µB = π(1 −n). In the presence of inﬁnitesimally small
µB we can evaluate the Liouville action by a probe approximation neglecting all
back reactions. By taking a derivative with respect to n, we obtain the entanglement
entropy12 SA:

Subregion Complexity
Finally we would like to evaluate the value of Liouville action SL[φ] in the reduced
sub-region. It is natural to argue that this provides a deﬁnition of complexity for the
reduced density matrix ρA. For various earlier proposals for holographic subregion
complexity refer to [23, 26].
As in the previous section we take A to be the interval −l ≤x ≤l. By computing

Energy Momentum Tensor in 2D CFTs
One of the most fundamental objects in two dimensional CFTs is the energy mo-
mentum tensor and in this section we show how to extract it from our optimization.
Since we already know how to compute entanglement entropy, our derivation will be
based on the ﬁrst-law of entanglement that relates changes in entanglement entropy
of an interval to the energy momentum tensor. More precisely, as shown in [69],
under small perturbations of a quantum state, the change of entanglement entropy
of a small interval A = [−l/2, l/2] is proportional to Ttt
∆SA ≃πl2
3 Ttt.
(5.1)
On the other hand, in our approach, the change in entanglement entropy under a
small variation of a quantum state is captured by the variation in the Liouville ﬁeld
φ(z) →φ0(z) + δφ(z). Moreover, for small perturbations we can write
δφ(z) = z2
2 ∂2
zδφ(z) + O(z4),

Let us now compare this with our explicit examples. The vacuum solution is given
by φ0(z) = −log (z). Then, after a simple shift, the thermoﬁeld double solution (3.5)

that for a = 1 reproduces the Casimir energy.
Let us also point the interesting consistency of the above result with the Liouville
energy momentum tensor. Namely, it is well known that by varying the action with
respect to the background ”reference” metric one can derive the Liouville energy
momentum tensor. The corresponding holomorphic and anti-holomorphic classical
energy momentum tensors are

(5.10)
One can check that, for our solutions, these energy momentum tensors match the
ones computed form the ﬁrst law. In general we can use the ﬁrst law for entanglement
entropy in states conformally mapped to the vacuum (see e.g. [70, 71]) and show
that the increase in the entropy is proportional to the (constant) Liouville energy
momentum tensor.

Evaluation of SL in 2D CFTs
Here we ﬁrst explain the properties of Liouville action SL in general setups with
boundaries. We will ﬁnd that it depends on the reference metric and it does not seem
to be possible to deﬁne its absolute value, which is due to the conformal anomaly in
2D CFTs. Rather we are lead to introduce an functional deﬁned by a diﬀerence of
Liouville action denoted by IL[g2, g1], where g1 is the reference metric and g2 is the
ﬁnal metric after the optimization. IL[g2, g1] is expected to measure of the complexity
between the two path-integrals in g1 and g2. Having them in mind, we proceed to
explicit evaluations of IL[g1, g2] in various cases.
6.1
General properties of the Liouville action
We start with a two dimensional space M described by the metric ds2 = gabdxadxb
(a, b = 1, 2), which is called the reference metric. We now perform the Weyl trans-
formation and deﬁne the rescaled metric:
ds2 = e2φgabdxadxb.

The Liouville action corresponding to this Weyl rescaling is given by

For this action, we can ﬁnd the following relation:
IL[e2˜φ˜g, ˜g] = IL[e2φg, g] −IL[˜g, g].
(6.12)
This expression is naturally interpreted that the action IL[e2˜φ˜g, ˜g] measures the dif-
ference between the ﬁnal metric e2˜φ˜g = e2φg and the reference metric ˜g = e2Ag. In
other words, this relation shows the chain rule:
IL[g1, g2] + IL[g2, g3] = IL[g1, g3],
(6.13)
which includes the identity IL[g2, g1] = −IL[g1, g2]. The diﬀerent between SL and
IL does not depend on the Liouville ﬁeld φ and thus the equations of motion from
the variations of φ in both actions are the same. It is useful to note that if g1 is
the ﬂat metric and the transformation from g1 and g2 is holomorphic, then we have
IL[g2, g1] = 0, in other words the second plus third term in (6.10) is vanishing.
In summary, SL[φ, g] does not provide us with an absolute quantity which mea-
sures the complexity of the optimized state because it depends not only on the ﬁnal
– 22 –

metric e2φg but also on the reference metric g. Rather, we ﬁnd it is convenient to
look at the relative quantity IL[g2, g1] which is expected to measure the diﬀerence of
complexity between the path-integral in g2 and g1.
Before we move onto explicit evaluations of IL[g2, g1], we would like to mention
that another potential source of ambiguity. We need to be careful with the fact that
a constant shift of φ can change the action SL when the Euler number is non-zero
due to the Gauss-Bonnet term

Vacuum States
Let us start with vacuum states in 2D CFTs on a circle with the circumference 2π.
In AdS3/CFT2, they are dual to the global AdS3. As we explained in section 3.2, we
obtained the Poincare disk metric (3.8) after the optimization. This metric can be
written in the following two ways:
ds2 = e2φ(dr2 + r2dθ2),
e2φ =
4
(1 −r2)2,
(6.14)
ds2 = e2˜φ(dz2 + dθ2),
e2˜φ =
1
sinh2 z,
(6.15)
where θ has a periodicity 2π. We introduce the cut oﬀz = ϵ and r = r0 such that
2r0
1−r2
0 = 1
ϵ or equally r0 ≃1 −ϵ + ϵ2
2 + .... We express the ﬂat metric for the polar
coordinate (r, θ) and the Cartesian one (z, θ) by g(r,θ) and g(z,θ), respectively. Also
the Poincare disk metric e2φg(r,θ) = e2˜φg(z,θ) is represented by gAdS.
The Liouville action for (6.14) is evaluated as

In the above, the contribution ∝−φ(r = 0) = −log 2 comes from the background
charge, while another one ∝φ(r = r0) = −log ϵ is the standard boundary contribu-
tion. Finally, as before, K0 corresponds the the trace of the extrinsic curvature of
the boundary evaluated in the ﬂat metric.
Similarly we can evaluate the Liouville action for (6.15)

Primary States
As we have seen in section (3.2), for the primary states, the optimized metric is given
by the conical geometry (denoted by gC):
ds2 = e2φ(dr2 + r2dθ2),
e2φ =
4a2
r2(1−a)(1 −r2a)2,
(6.22)
ds2 = e2˜φ(dz2 + dθ2),
e2˜φ =

sinh2 (az),
(6.23)
where we deﬁne r = e−z with −z∞< z < −ϵ, δ(≡e−z∞) < r < r0 and 0 ≤θ < 2π.
The UV cut oﬀr = r0 is speciﬁed as

(6.24)
which is solved as ra

(6.27)
which indeed satisfy (6.13). When a = 1, they are reduced to (6.19), (6.20), (6.21).
For a ̸= 1, the actions for gC include IR divergences, which may be canceled by
further adding a background charge at the conical singularity.
6.4
Finite Temperature State
Finally we turn to the thermoﬁeld double (TFD) states dual to BTZ black holes. As
discussed in section 3.1, after the optimization we obtained the metric of Einstein-
Rosen bridge (denoted by gER):

Application to NAdS2/CFT1
As recently discovered, to make sense of AdS2/CFT1, we need a conformal sym-
metry breaking term [75–78], under the reparameterization of ˜τ = ˜τ(τ), often called
NAdS2/CFT1 duality. The eﬀective action is written as a Schwarzian derivative term
Sch[˜τ, τ] as explicitly realized in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model [73, 74]:
Sch[˜τ, τ] = −3

(7.1)
For the one dimensional metric ds2 = e2φdτ 2, we can identify d˜τ
dτ = eφ. Thus
the conformal symmetry breaking term (7.1) looks like N
R
dτ(∂τφ)2, where N is
a constant proportional to degrees of freedom.
Therefore we ﬁnd (we shifted φ
appropriately)
Ψgττ=e2φ( ˜ϕ(x)) = eS1[φ]−S1[0] · Ψgττ=1( ˜ϕ(x)),
S1[φ] = N
Z
dτ

(∂τφ)2 + 2eφ
.
(7.2)
By minimizing the action, this again leads to
ds2 = e2φdτ 2 = dτ 2
τ 2 .
(7.3)
This is consistent with the time slice of AdS2 space-time. Note that if there is no
conformal symmetry breaking eﬀect, we cannot stabilize the optimization procedure.
Also notice that in standard tensor network descriptions, it is very diﬃcult to describe
one dimensional quantum mechanics as we normally coarse-grain space directions to
build an extra dimension in the network. In our path-integral approach the extra
dimension arises naturally even in quantum mechanics.

Applications to Higher Dimensional CFTs
Higher dimensional generalizations of our optimization procedure do not seem to be
straightforward as the generic metric cannot be expressed only by the Weyl scaling
as in (2.5). Nevertheless, it is useful to see what optimization can lead to correct
time slices of gravity duals by taking into account only the Weyl scaling degrees of
freedom as a ﬁrst step toward this direction. As we will see below, at least for pure
AdSd+1 we can obtain expected results even from this limited range of optimization.
8.1
Our Formulation
For this we need a complexity functional I[φ] for the metric of the form:
ds2 = e2φ(x)gabdxadxb,
(8.1)
with x regarded as d dimensional vector (which includes “z” coordinate). We pro-
pose that for a vacuum state in a d dimensional CFT, the optimization can be done
by minimizing the following functional Ibulk
d
[φ, g] (N is a normalization factor pro-
portional to the degrees of freedom):
Ibulk

[φ, g] = N

e(d−2)φ
(d −1)(d −2)Rg

,
(8.2)
where Rg is the Ricci scalar for the reference metric g.
Reader can regard this
as a generalization of Liouville action to general dimensions, which is quadratic in
derivative of φ ﬁeld14. The computation of entanglement entropy shown later allows
us to identify the normalization factor N in (8.2) for holographic CFTs:
N = (d −1)Rd−1
16πGN
,
(8.3)
where R is the AdS radius In particular for d = 2 and d = 4 we ﬁnd
Nd=2 =
c
24π,
Nd=4 =
3
2π2a4,
(8.4)
in terms of the central charge c in 2D CFTs and a4 in 4D CFTs.
Indeed, the minimization of Ibdy
d [φ, g] leads to the hyperbolic space Hd which is
the time slice of pure AdSd+1 as we will see later. For the optimization of reduced
density matrix we need to introduce the boundary term as in section 4. We argue it
is given by

14The possibility of having terms in the complexity functional with higher than quadratic deriva-
tives of φ is discussed in section 8.8 and in appendix C. In fact they will be important for reproducing
correct anomalies for even dimensional CFTs in higher dimensions.
– 27 –

where γij is the induced metric on the boundary ∂Σ. This again leads to the boundary
condition K + (d −1)µB = 0, where K = e−φ((d −1)∂nφ + K0). We deﬁned our
optimization by minimizing the total functional Itot
d [φ, g]
Itot
d [φ, g] = Ibulk
d
[φ, g] + Ibdy
d [φ, g].
(8.6)
It is important to consider the limit d →2 in Itot
d [φ, g] and explore the possibility
of recovering the standard Liouville action for d = 2 dimensions. As it is obvious
from the expression of Ibulk
d
[φ, g] in (8.2), a naive limit of d →2 is singular as the third
term on the RHS of (8.2) gives a contribution proportional to 1/(d −2). However,
as it was mentioned in section 6.1 (see the discussion in the paragraphs following
(6.11)), for an absolute measure of complexity in 2-dimensions the relative or the
improved Liouville action IL(g1, g2), deﬁned in (6.11), is more suitable compared to
SL, deﬁned in (6.2). The advantage was mentioned to be the fact that IL(g1, g2)
being a relative measure of complexity does not depend on the reference metric. It
is interesting to note that the subtlety of taking the d →2 limit works out perfectly
if we subtract away the contribution of the reference metric while taking the above
mentioned limit. Therefore we notice the following identity
lim
d→2

Itot
d [φ, g] −Itot
d [φ = 0, g]

= IL[e2φg, g],
(8.7)
where gab is considered as the reference 2-dimensional metric and therefore following
the discussion after (6.11), IL[e2φg, g] computes the relative complexity of the generic
metric e2φgab compared to that reference metric.
Notice that actually we can combine the functional Id + Ibdy
d
into the Einstein-
Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant on the ﬁnal metric (8.1) which we write
˜g = e2φg and ˜γ = e2φγ:

From this manifestly covariant expression which only depends on ˜g, as opposed to
the 2D Liouville action, the invariance of the action by the change of reference metric
is manifest:
Itot
d [φ −A, e2Ag] = Itot
d [φ, g].
(8.9)
8.2
AdSd+1 from Optimization
Here we would like to conﬁrm that the optimization leads to expected AdS geometries
for vacuums states. This is almost obvious from the expression (8.8). However notice
that we take only the Weyl mode φ dynamical.

(8.17)
They coincide with the time slice of AdSd+1 as expected.
8.3
Excitations in Global AdSd+1
Now let us consider excitations in a d dimensional CFT on R×Sd−1. We focus on
the case d = 3, 4 and assume that the excitations are homogeneous and static. In
AdSd+1/CFTd, such a state is dual to spherically symmetric solution given by the
AdS4 Schwarzschild black hole solution
ds2 = −h(ρ)dt2 + dρ2
h(ρ) + ρ2dΩ2
d−1.
(8.18)
with h(ρ) = ρ2 +1−Mρ−(d−2). Here we are interested in the leading correction when
M is very small. We focus on the time slice t = 0 and rewrite
ds2 = dρ2
h(ρ) + ρ2dΩ2
d−1 = e2φ(dr2 + r2dΩ2
d−1).

(8.22)
where the function η(r) is explicitly given for each d:

(8.23)
d = 4 :
η(r) = r6 + 9r4 −9r2 −12 (r4 + r2) log(r) −1
16r2 (r2 −1)
.
(8.24)
On the other hand, the optimization of our functional (8.2) given by the diﬀer-
ential equation (8.15) leads to the perturbative solution of the form:
eφ =

(1 −r2)

1 + ˜

(8.25)
where we treat ˜
M as an inﬁnitesimally small parameter. We can analytically deter-
mine the function h(r) and conﬁrm that h(r) is equal to η(r) in (8.23) and (8.24) in
each dimension up to a constant factor.
In this way we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst order back-reaction to the time slice metric in
AdS gravity is correctly reproduced by our optimization procedure.
8.4
Holographic Entanglement Entropy
In this subsection we will show that the total action Ibulk
d
+ Ibdy
d
can reproduce the
correct holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) [13] when the subsystem A is a
round ball. We will also focus on d = 3, 4 case in the AdSd+1/CFTd.
We will closely follow the method that was explicitly used in the case of 2D CFT
in section 4. We start with the holographic construction of density matrix and argue
– 30 –

that this accurately reproduce the entanglement wedge as expected and following
that we will compute the entanglement entropy holographically.
The metric of the manifold on which the path-integral for the density matrix is
being computed, will be denoted by

where, sometimes, we will also use the notation ds2 = e2φgabdxadxb, with the under-
standing that the reference metric gab is the ﬂat metric gabdxadxb = dz2+Pd−1
i=1 dx2
i =
dz2 + dr2 + r2dΩ2
d−2. Also, dΩ2
d−2 is the metric for (d −2)-dimensional unit sphere.
Therefore, we will have

the radius of the circular disk.
Following the same steps, as depicted in section 4, we should proceed with the
optimization that will lead us to identifying the boundaries Γ(d)
A of the bulk regions
Σ(d)
± . The boundary condition for φ should be imposed at the two edges of the slit
composed by the boundary of the round ball AD, i.e. at r = ℓnear z = 0. These

The extrinsic curvature of the boundary is
K = γab∇anb = e−φ(K0 + (d −1)na∂aφ).
(8.30)
where K0 is the extrinsic curvature for the same boundary but in the reference metric
gab (which is ﬂat metric in our case)
K0 = −
f ′′
(1 + (f ′)2)3/2.
(8.31)
The boundary condition for the ﬁeld on the edge of the slit (the round ball AD in
our case) is Dirichlet, however we need to impose Neumann boundary condition on
the surface ΓA and it leads us to the condition
K + (d −1)µB = 0.
(8.32)
– 31 –

For the determination of the density matrix, since the two boundaries ΓA in Σ+
and that in Σ−are pasted smoothly, we should consider µB = 0. The optimization
determines the bulk metric to be the hyperbolic one φ = −log z.
In order to ﬁx the shape of ΓA we should solve K = 0, which is precisely the
condition of minimal surfaces. Thus we ﬁnd that ΓA is given by the half-sphere
z2 + r2 = ℓ2. Accordingly, the holographic dual for the density matrix corresponds
to the region z2 + r2 ≤ℓ2 and it agrees with the entanglement wedge.
Let us now consider the entanglement entropy and for that we need to consider
ρn
A and ﬁnally analytically continue considering |n −1| ≪1, leading us to a conical
geometry with deﬁcit angle 2π(1 −n) along the entangling surface r = ℓ. It is then
natural to expect that the extrinsic curvature for the boundaries ΓA will now become
diﬀerent from vanishing, i.e. K ̸= 0. This can be estimated from considering that
the boundaries ΓA now changes from z2 + r2 = ℓ2 to (z −z0)2 + r2 = ℓ2, with which
we can now evaluate the extrinsic curvature
K = −(d −1)z0
l .
(8.33)
Also with inﬁnitesimal z0 we obtain r ∼l + z0
l z + O(z2) near the boundary point
{z, r, Ω(d−2)} = {0, ℓ, Ω(d−2)}. The corner angle at the intersection of ∂Σ(d−1)
±
and
the entangling surface r = ℓ, also becomes π/2 + z0/l. For the n-sheeted conical
geometry we can interpret this corner angle as z0/l = π(1 −n) and thus obtain the
relation
K = (d −1)(n −1).
(8.34)
We need to satisfy the Neumann boundary condition K + (d −1)µB = 0 at ∂Σ(d−1)
±
,
and we implement this by setting
µB = π(1 −n).
(8.35)
Note that this condition is true for any dimension d.

the holographic entanglement entropy can be evaluated for d = 3 by considering

Evaluation of Complexity Functional
As we argued for 2D CFTs (see discussions following (2.13)), the Liouville action,
SL when computed on-shell for the solutions gives us a measure of holographic com-
putational complexity. Here we would like to examine an analogous quantity for the
higher dimensional CFTs. Namely, we evaluate the complexity functional Ibulk

for optimized solutions corresponding to the global AdSd+1. We focus on the d = 3, 4
case again.

For the sake of comparing our results with the existing literature, which we do
in the next sub-section, we have to set µB = 0 and the normalization factor N in the
above formulas should be taken as deﬁned in (8.3) for holographic CFTs. Therefore,
by simply setting RAdS = 1, the complexity CΨ0 of the vacuum state |Ψ0⟩computed
from our complexity functional Itot

8.6
Comparison with Earlier Conjectures
It is worthwhile to compare our complexity functional Itot
d
evaluated speciﬁcally for
dimensions d = 3, 4 in the previous subsection, with those in earlier conjectures.
(1) “Complexity = Volume” Conjecture
Recently there has been exciting developments in understanding computational
complexity in quantum systems holographically, i.e. some geometric calculation in
the gravity side has been proposed to be measuring the computational complexity.
The computational complexity of any boundary state at any given time, i.e. on some
spacelike slice, say Σ, of the boundary, was ﬁrst proposed in [21, 22] to be identiﬁed
with the volume of a maximal volume space-like slice, say MΣ, in the bulk where the
– 34 –

bulk space like surface ends on the given boundary slice. We will refer to it as the
CV-conjecture (complexity = volume),
CV (Σ) = V(MΣ)
GNRAdS
,
such that ∂MΣ = Σ
(8.47)
where V(MΣ) denotes the volume of the maximal time slice MΣ, and RAdS is some
associated length scale in the bulk, conveniently taken to be the AdS radius in
AdS/CFT. For TFD states in holographic CFTs, the gravity dual computation of
CV shows the linear growth [21, 22].
It may also be useful to mentioned that in the paper [39], it was found that
the gravity dual of the information metric G(Σ) in CFTd, which is equivalent to an
integral of two point functions of a marginal primary operator, is well approximated
by G(Σ) ≃nd · V(MΣ)
Rd
AdS (nd is a numerical constant). Indeed, the information metric
in CFTs also have the linear growth under the time evolution of a TFD state.
(2) “Complexity = Action” Conjecture
Later, in [28, 29], it was also conjectured that the complexity is given by the
action of a Wheeler-de Witt patch in the bulk bounded by the given space-like
surface. One motivation for this conjecture was to remove the unpleasant feature
about the CV-conjecture that it depends on a the choice of a length scale RAdS. We
will refer to it as the CA-conjecture (complexity = Action)
CA(Σ) = IWDW
π
(8.48)
where IWDW is given by the Einstein-Hilbert action integrated only over the Wheeler-
DeWitt (WDW) patch MWDW, which extends from the boundary time slice Σ where
we measure the complexity. The WDW patch is deﬁned to be the bulk space-time
region in the bulk which is union of all the space-like surfaces anchored at the bound-
ary at a given time of the CFT. It is easy to visualize this for the eternal black-hole
Penrose diagram (see ﬁgure 1 in [28]). In that case, once we pick two given times
at the two boundary CFTs, say tL and tR respectively, the WDW patch is the bulk
space-time region bounded by the null surfaces and such that it is union of all possible
space-like surfaces anchored at the times tL and tR in the boundary.
Schematically, IWDW can be written as
IWDW =
1
16πGN
Z
MW DW
dd+1x√−g(R −2Λ) + Ibdy
WDW,
(8.49)
where Ibdy
WDW contains the important boundary contributions coming from the null
boundaries of the WDW patch MWDW, also including the joint contributions coming
from the intersections of the null boundaries [31].
In a related direction a quantity called complexity of formation was deﬁned and
studied in [33]. This quantity computes, following the CA conjecture, the diﬀerence
– 35 –

of the action (only the bulk part) between the BTZ and two times that of the AdS
(vacuum). The similar results were reproduced in [36] with a proposal of renormalized
holographic complexity.
It is important to mention that, through our proposal we can only learn about
the ﬁxed time behavior of the computational complexity for the dual state in the
CFT, whereas, the original motivation of proposing a holographic measure of com-
plexity was to study it’s growth with time [28, 29, 31]. In order to compare the
evaluation of complexity with our proposal with the same evaluated using other pro-
posals, we need to therefore look into their constant time evaluations. In [26, 34]
the authors investigated the constant time behavior of the holographic complexity.
More speciﬁcally they studied the divergence structure, considering both the CV and
CA-conjectures. Also a possible prescription to remove an ambiguity due to diﬀer-
ent parametrization of the null boundary surfaces in the WDW patch was found in
[31]. This prescription was used to evaluate the holographic complexity in [34]. In
appendix B, we summarize these results of holographic complexity by focusing on
the vacuum states.
Comparisons with Our Results
We are ﬁnally ready to compare the evaluation of holographic complexity with
our proposal against the same computed with the existing proposals in the literature,
presented in appendix B.
First if we follow the “Complexity = Volume” conjecture (8.47), the complexity
has the structure CV ∼c(1)
v ·ϵ−(d−1) +c(3)
v ·ϵ−(d−3) +···. This behavior agrees with our
results of complexity CΨ0 presented in (8.46), (8.44) and (8.45), though the relative
coeﬃcients do not coincide in general.
Next we turn to the “Complexity = Action” conjecture (8.48). The analysis in
[26] evaluates it to be divergent, in fact a logarithmically enhanced divergence of the
form log ϵ−1 ·ϵ(d−1) for the CA-conjecture as opposed to the 1/ϵd−1 divergence for the
CV-conjecture. On the other side, the [34] proposal, which introduces an additional
boundary contribution, produces a surprising result for the d = 2 case i.e. bulk
AdS3: for both Poincare and global AdS3, the leading divergence vanishes, leading
to a constant holographic complexity. In higher dimensions d = 3, 4, the holographic
complexity has a leading divergence of the form 1/ϵd−1 for both Poincare and global
AdSd+1. Therefore the divergence structure in [34] for d > 2 is the same as ours,
whereas, they diﬀer in the numerical coeﬃcients in general. Nevertheless, in the
next subsection, we will point out an interesting relation between our complexity
functional Itot
d
and the gravity action IWDW in the WDW patch.
Since there is no precise deﬁnition of computational complexity in quantum ﬁeld
theories known at present, we cannot decide which of these prescriptions is true by
consulting with rigorous results in ﬁeld theory. However, notice that our proposal of
computational complexity CΨ0, deﬁned in (2.4), is based on not any holography but
– 36 –

a purely ﬁeld theoretic argument as is clear in two dimensional CFT case, where it
is related to the normalization of wave functional.
8.7
Relation to “Complexity = Action” Proposal
We have discussed in the previous subsection that, in [28, 29], it has been conjectured
that the holographic complexity is measured by the bulk action being integrated over
the WDW patch deﬁned above including suitable boundary terms. Here we would
like to compare this quantity with our complexity functional. For simplicity, we set
RAdS = 1 and thus Λ = −d(d−1)
2
below.
Consider the following class of d + 1 dimensional space-time:
ds2 = −dt2 + cos2 t · e2φ(x)hijdxidxj,
(8.50)
where t takes the range −π/2 ≤t ≤π/2 and i, j = 1, 2, · · ·, d. The pure AdSd+1
which is a solution to the Einstein equation from IWDW, is obtained when the metric
e2φ(x)hijdxidxj coincides with a hyperbolic space Hd. For example, when d = 2, the
Einstein equation just leads to (∂2
1 + ∂2
2)φ = e2φ i.e. the Liouville equation. Note
that in this pure AdSd+1 solution, the coordinate covered by (8.50) indeed represents
the WDW patch.15 Motivated by this we identify this space (8.50) with MWDW.
However, note that for generic choices of φ and hij (8.50) does not represent the
WDW patch in the original deﬁnition in [28, 29]. They coincide only on-shell.
Now we would like to evaluate the gravity action (8.49) within the WDW patch,
integrating out the time t coordinate. Here we can ignore the contribution from the
boundary as the Gibbons-Hawking term of this boundary turns out to be vanishing.
We ﬁnally ﬁnd that the ﬁnal action is proportional to our complexity functional
Itot
d [φ, g] (8.2) with the normalization (8.3) up to surface terms at the AdS boundary
z = 0 due to partial integrations:
IWDW
d
= (d −2) · nd · Itot
d [φ, g] + (IR Surface Term),
(8.51)
where the numerical constant nd is deﬁned by
nd =

−π/2
dt(cos t)d−2 =
√πΓ
  d−1


Γ
  d

.
(8.52)
In the above computation, by introducing the Gibbons-Hawking term for the d di-
mensional boundary time like surface given by z = ϵ, the surface terms on this surface
which are produced by the partial integrations of bulk action are all cancelled with
the Gibbons-Hawking term. Therefore in the surface terms in (8.51) is localized at
the IR boundary, which is at z = ∞and gives the vanishing contribution for the
Poincare AdS coordinate.
15In Euclidean signature obtained by t →iτ, this leads to the hyperbolic slice of Hd+1 which is
precisely given by (3.19).

For example, when d = 3 with hij = δij (setting x3 = z), so that it ﬁts with the
Poincare AdS4, we ﬁnd

(8.53)
which reproduces (8.51) after we integrate t and perform a partial integration with
the boundary term at z = ϵ cancelled by the Gibbons-Hawking term at z = ϵ.

fore we simply ﬁnd IWDW

= 0
for CFT2 vacuum on R1 dual to the Poincare AdS3,
IWDW

=

for CFT2 vacuum on S1 dual to the Poincare AdS3.
Interestingly, this agrees with the evaluation of holographic complexity with the
prescription in [34].
The above relation shows that there is no diﬀerence with respect to the equa-
tion of motion for φ between the “Complexity = Action” approach and our pro-
posal. However in the d = 2 limit they diﬀers signiﬁcantly due to (d −2) factor
in (8.51). In our proposal, the complexity functional for 2D CFTs is obtained as
limd→2(Itot
d [φ, g] −Itot
d [0, g]) = limd→2

, which coin-
cides with the Liouville action IL[φ, g]. On the other hand, there are no bulk contri-
butions in IWDW
2
as clear from (8.54). This is essential reason why the former have
the UV divergence O(ϵ−1), while the latter does not.
8.8
Higher Derivative Terms and Anomalies
In our optimization of two dimensional CFTs, we minimized the overall factor of wave
functional, which is the same as the partition function Z for the region ϵ < z < ∞.
The Liouville action which we minimize is given by the log of this partition function
SL = log Z. Therefore even for higher dimensional CFTs one may naively suspect
that the complexity functional Id may also be written as Id = log Zd for d-dimensional
CFTs. This indeed works for d = 3 as the UV divergent terms produces the two
terms in the action (8.2). The situation is diﬀerent for d = 4 due to the presence
– 38 –

of conformal anomaly [80] and we need to have forth derivative terms in addition to
the action (8.2). As we have explained in appendix C, here we just mention the ﬁnal
form of I4 that correctly reproduces the anomalies in a four dimensional CFT,
I4 =
Z
d4x√g

α1 + α2(∂µφ∂µφ) + α3(∂µφ∂µφ)2 + α4(∇µ∂µφ)2
+ α5(∇µ∂µφ)(∂µφ∂µφ)

,
(8.55)
where the terms with corresponding coeﬃcients α3, α4, α5 denote the fourth deriva-
tive terms, responsible for producing correct anomalies. It should be mentioned that
here we only consider metrics which are of the Weyl scaling type (2.5),
gµν = e2φ hﬂat
µν ,
(8.56)
with hﬂat
µν corresponding to Euclidean ﬂat space.
In appendix C, we ﬁrstly explain in detail how this action in (8.55) produces the
correct anomalies for four dimensional CFT. Next we also explain how the equations
of motion following from this action allows time slice of AdS5, i.e. hyperbolic space
H4, as a solution.
Here we should admit that the action (8.55) is not bounded from below and
hence cannot be minimized, therefore we can only extremize it. In this aspect, the
action (8.2) without higher derivatives as we assumed in section 2.3 has an advantage
over the modiﬁed action we are discussing here.

Discussions:
Time Evolution of TFD States and Phase
Transitions
So far we have studied stationary quantum states in CFTs. For further understand-
ings of the dynamics of CFTs, we would like to turn to time dependent states in
this section, focusing on 2D CFTs for simplicity. In particular we consider a simple
but non-trivial class of time-dependent states, given by the time evolution of thermo
ﬁeld double states (TFD states) in 2D CFTs:
|TFD(t)⟩=
1
p
Zβ(t)
X
n
e−β
4 (H1+H2)e−it(H1+H2)|n⟩1|n⟩2,
(9.1)
where the total Hilbert space is doubled Htot = H1 ⊗H2 (H1 is the original CFT
Hilbert space and H2 is its identical copy). Its density matrix16 is given by ρ(t) =
16However note that ρ(t) can not be obtained from the analytic continuation τ = it of Eu-
clidean TFD density matrix ρ(τ) = |TFD(τ)⟩⟨TFD(τ)| deﬁned by the Euclidean path-integral
for the Euclidean time region −β/4 −τ ≤τ ≤β/4 + τ.
Instead it is obtained from ρ′(τ) =
|TFD(τ)⟩⟨TFD(−τ)|.
– 39 –

|TFD(t)⟩⟨TFD(t)| and if we trace out H2, then the reduced density matrix ρ1 is
time-independent, given by the standard canonical distribution ρ1 ∝e−βH1. However
the TFD state |TFD(t)⟩shows very nontrivial time evolution and is closely related
to quantum quenches as pointed out in [83].
9.1
Optimizing TFD State
Motivated by this, let us study the path-integral expression of |TFD(t)⟩. First we
can create the initial TFD state |TFD(0)⟩by the Euclidean path-integral for the
range of Euclidean time τ:
−β
4 ≤τ ≤β
4 .
(9.2)
After this path-integration, we can perform the Lorentzian path-integral by it on
each CFT. This integration contour is depicted as the left picture in Fig.8. However,
as we will see later, there is an equivalent but more useful contour given by the
right picture in Fig.8. This is because we can exchange the Euclidean time evolution
e−β(H1+H2)/4 with the real time one e−it(H1+H2).
Now we consider an optimization of this path-integral. For the Euclidean part we
can apply the same argument as before and minimize the Liouville action. Next we
need to consider an optimization of the real time evolution. However, we would like
to argue that this Lorentzian path-integral cannot be optimized. A heuristic reason
for this is that if the ﬁnal state even after a long time evolution, is still sensitive
to the initial state as opposed to the Euclidean path-integral. On the other hand,
if we perform an Euclidean time evolution for a period ∆τ, then the ﬁnal state is
insensitive to the high momentum mode k ≫1/∆τ of the initial state. Once we
assume this argument, we can understand the reason why we place the Lorentzian
time evolution in the middle sandwiched by the Euclidean evolution as this obviously
reduces the value of SL. It is an intriguing future problem to verify these intuitive
arguments using the tensor network framework.

Figure 9: The optimization of path-integral for the TFD states. The Euclidean
path-integral is optimized by minimizing the Liouville action. We assumed that the
Lorentzian one cannot be optimized.
It is also intriguing to estimate the complexity. For the Euclidean part, we pro-
posed that it is given by the Liouville action as we explained before. For Lorentzian
part, there is no obvious candidate. However since we assumed that φ is constant
during the real time evolution, we can make a natural identiﬁcation: the Liouville
potential term gives the complexity. This is clear from the fact that the complexity
should be proportional to the number of tensors.
Thinking this way, we ﬁnd
SL(t) = SL(0) +

This linear t growth is consistent with the basic idea in [22]. Since the energy in our
2D CFT at ﬁnite temperature T = 1/β is given by
ECFT = π2

(9.5)
we ﬁnd
dSL(t)

(9.6)
Interestingly this growth is equal to a half of the gravity action IWDW on the WDW
patch for holographic complexity found in [28, 29], where the holographic complexity

(8.48). Note that we are shifting both the time
in the ﬁrst and second CFT at the time time. This relation dIW DW

= 2dSL
dt may be
natural because the partition function of CFTs Z ∼eA is the square of that of wave
functional in CFTs |Ψ|2 ∼e2SL.
It is also intriguing to consider a pure state which looks thermal when we coarse-
grain its total system. One typical such example in CFTs is obtained by regularizing
a boundary state |B⟩
|ΨB⟩= NBe−βH/4|B⟩,
(9.7)
where NB is the normalization such that ⟨ψB|ψB⟩= 1. This can also be regarded as
an approximation of global quenches [81, 82]. This quantum state is dual to a single-
sided black hole [83] shows the linear growth of holographic entanglement entropy
which matches with the 2D CFT result in [81]. This state after our path-integral
optimization is clearly given by a half of TFD (6.28) for 0 < z < β/4 −ϵ. The
boundary at z = 0 corresponds to that of the boundary state |B⟩which matches
with the AdS/BCFT formulation [84]. Thus the growth of the complexity functional
is simply given by a half of the TFD case (9.6).
9.2
Comparison with Eternal BTZ black hole
The time evolution of TFD state provides an important class of time-dependent states
and here we would like to discuss possible connections between our optimization
procedure and its gravity dual given by the eternal BTZ black hole. In this section
we set β = 2π for simplicity.
First let us try to assume that the dual geometry for this time-dependent quan-
tum states has a property that each time slice is given by a space-like geometry which
is a solution to Liouville equation. Any solution to the Liouville equation is always
a hyperbolic space with a constant curvature. Such a hyperbolic space at each time
t is obtained by taking a union of all geodesic which connects two points at the time
t with the same space coordinate in the two diﬀerent boundaries, given explicitly by

However if we evaluate its action (as in the computation of (6.31)) we ﬁnd (we

Thus there is no linear t growth. In this way, this surface does not seem to have an
expected property which supports the linearly growing complexity argued in many
papers [21, 22, 28, 29, 31].
Now we would like to turn to another candidate: maximal time slice, whose
volume was conjectured to be one candidates of holographic complexity [21, 22].
Note that this maximal time slice is not a solution to Liouville equation as opposed
to the previous hyperbolic space (9.8), which is constructed from geodesics.
The BTZ metric behind the horizon can be obtained by the analytic continuation
ρ = iκ, ˜t = t + πi
2 . Maximal volume surface with boundary time t is determined by
the equation
s2(t) = cosh2 ρ sinh4 ρ

−˙κ2 + sin2 κ.
(9.15)
s(t)2 increases monotonically as t (≥0) increases, with boundary value s(0) = 0 and
s(∞) = 1/2. The induced metric on the maximal volume time-slice is
ds2 = cosh2 ρ

.
(9.16)
The curvature of the maximal volume time slice is not constant, therefore the time
slice is not hyperbolic. Then, we ﬁnd that the volume term increases linearly in time.
Finally we obtain
c

d(Vol(t))

(9.17)
at late time (here we used the same normalization as our proposal for the Liouville
action). This behavior is in contrast to the previous hyperbolic time slice, where the
action approaches monotonically to some constant value.
– 43 –

In summary, the above arguments imply that for a generic time dependent back-
ground, the assumption that a preferred time slice in a gravity dual is described by
Liouville equation, is not compatible with the requirement that the Liouville action
gives a measure of complexity.
Thus an extension of our proposal in this paper
to time-dependent backgrounds looks highly non-trivial and deserves future careful
studies.

Comment on Phase Transition
It is also intriguing to discuss how we can understand the conﬁnement/deconﬁnement
phase transition in our approach. For this, we focus on the initial state |TFD(t = 0)⟩.
Since our approach is based on pure states we need to consider the wave functional of
TFD state (at temperature T) and see how the corresponding tensor network changes
as a function of T. It is obvious that at high temperature, the connected network
which looks like macroscopic wormhole is realized and this should be described by
the optimized path-integral on the Einstein-Rosen bridge (3.5). As we make the
temperature lower, the neck of bridge gets squeezed and eventually disconnected in
a macroscopic sense. Here we mean by the macroscopic the quantum entanglement
of order O(c) = O(1/GN). Refer to Fig.10.
Since the TFD state has non-zero (but sub-leading order O(1)) entanglement
entropy between the two identical CFTs even at low temperature, there should be a
microscopic bridge or wormhole (following ER=EPR conjecture [85]) which connects
the two sides in the tensor network description. In this low temperature, the bridge
is due to the singlet sector of the gauge theory and is in its conﬁned phase. In large
c holographic CFTs, there should be a phase transition of the macroscopic form of
the tensor network at the value β = 1/T = 2π predicted by AdS3/CFT2. Naturally,

Figure 10: The expected description of conﬁnement/deconﬁnement phase transition
in our optimization of path-integral for the TFD states. At low temperature the two
CFTs are connected through a microscopic bridge with entanglement entropy O(1)
in the tensor network. At high temperature the bridge gets macroscopic and has
entanglement entropy O(c).
– 44 –

we expect that the favored phase of a given quantum state Ψ is the one which has
smaller complexity CΨ.
However, in the current form of our arguments based on the path-integral op-
timization, it is not straightforward to compare the value of the complexity (i.e.
Liouville action) for the conﬁnement/deconﬁnement phase transition. This is be-
cause we can only deﬁne the diﬀerence of complexity which depends on the reference
metric. In this phase transition, the topology of the reference space changes and it
is diﬃcult to know how to compere them precisely.
Nevertheless, it might be useful to try to roughly estimate the complexity. For
this we assume that the complexity for the deconﬁned phase (denoted by Cdec) is
estimated by by the bridge solution (6.30) and that for the conﬁned phase (denoted
by Ccon) is by the twice of the vacuum result (6.16), which leads to
Cdec ≈c
3ϵ −π2c
6β ,
Ccon ≈c
3ϵ −c
3.
(9.18)
Qualitatively, this has an expected behavior that Cdec < Ccon for β ≪2π and vise
versa, though the phase transition temperature reads β = π2/2, which is slightly
diﬀerent from the gravity result 2π.
Another interesting interpretation of the phase transition can be found from a
property in the Liouville CFT. It is known that the (chiral) conformal dimension
h of any local operators in Liouville theory has an upper bound (so called Seiberg
bound [52]):
h ≤c −1
24 ,
(9.19)
which implies the non-normalizability of the corresponding state. The operator which
violates the bound should be regarded as a (normalizable) quantum state. In the
large c limit, this bound (9.19) agrees with the condition that the conical deﬁcit
angle parameter a given by (3.16), takes a real value, for which the metric is that for
conﬁned phase. When it is violated, a becomes imaginary and the metric changes
into that for the deconﬁned phase (Einstein-Rosen bridge). This behavior seems to
ﬁt very nicely with the gravity dual prediction and to proceed this further is an
important future problem.

Conclusions
In this work, we proposed an optimization procedure of Euclidean path-integrals for
quantum states in CFTs. The optimization is described by a change of the back-
ground metric on the space where the path integral is performed. The optimization
is completed by minimizing the complexity functional IΨ for a given state |Ψ⟩, which
is argued to be given by the Liouville action for 2D CFTs. The Liouville ﬁeld φ corre-
sponds to the Weyl scaling of the background metric. Since this complexity is deﬁned
from Euclidean path-integrals, we propose to call this “Path-Integral Complexity”.
– 45 –

Through calculations in various examples in 2d CFTs, we observed that opti-
mized metrics for static quantum states coincide with those of time slices of their
gravity duals. Thus we argued that our path-integral optimization oﬀers a continuous
version of the tensor network interpretation of AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. More-
over, we also ﬁnd a simple formula to calculate the energy density for each quantum
state.
At the same time, we provide a ﬁeld theory framework for evaluating the com-
putational complexity of any quantum states in CFTs. Note however, that in 2D
CFTs, due to the conformal anomaly, the complexity functional (i.e. Liouville ac-
tion) depends on the reference metric. Therefore, we proposed to use the diﬀerence
of the action, which is expected to give a relative diﬀerence of complexity between
the optimized network and the initial un-optimized one. We evaluated this quantity
in several examples.
In order to calculate the entanglement entropy, we studied an optimization of
reduced density matrices. After the optimization we ﬁnd that the geometry is given
by two copies of entanglement wedge and this nicely ﬁts into the gravity dual. The
entanglement entropy is ﬁnally reduced to the length of the boundary of the entan-
glement wedge and precisely reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy.
Even though in most parts of this paper our analysis is devoted to static quan-
tum states, we also discussed how our optimization of path-integrals can be applied
to time-dependent backgrounds in 2D CFTs.
Especially, we considered the time
evolution of thermo-ﬁeld states which describe ﬁnite temperature states as a basic
example. Our heuristic arguments show that an wormhole throat region linearly
grows under the time evolution, which is consistent with holographic predictions.
Moreover, we discussed how to interpret the conﬁnement/deconﬁnement phase tran-
sition in terms of tensor networks and our path-integral approach, whose details will
be an interesting future problem. However, a precise connection between Liouville
action and time-dependent states in 2D CFTs is still not clear and this was left as
an important future problem.
In the latter half of this paper, we investigated the application of our optimization
method to CFTs in other dimensions than two. In one dimension, we ﬁnd that 1D
version of Liouville action naturally arises from the conformal symmetry breaking
eﬀect in NAdS2/CFT1 and this explains the emergence of extra dimension as in the
AdS3/CFT2 case.
In higher dimensions, we expect that the optimization procedure gets very com-
plicated as we need to change not only the scaling mode but also other components
of the metric as opposed to the 2D case. We focused on the Weyl scaling mode
and proposed a complexity functional which looks like a higher dimensional version
of Liouville action. However, notice the crucial diﬀerence from the 2D case that
the higher dimensional action does not depend on the reference metric. We con-
ﬁrmed that this reproduces the correct time slice metric for the vacuum states and
– 46 –

correct holographic entanglement entropy when the subsystem is a round sphere.
We pointed out an interesting direct connection to earlier proposal of holographic
complexity [28, 29], which may suggest we should optimize with respect to all com-
ponents of the metric. We also analyzed the spherically symmetric excited states and
found that the optimized metric agrees with the AdS Schwarzschild one up to the
ﬁrst order contribution of the mass parameter. We observed that for CFTs in any
dimensions (including 2D), in order to take into account higher order back-reactions,
we need to treat the Liouville mode φ in a quantum way. It is also possible to include
higher derivative corrections without losing the above properties as we discussed in
appendix (C). One advantage of this is that we can realize the higher dimensional
conformal anomaly. However there is also a disadvantage that the action is no longer
positive deﬁnite and cannot be minimized but extremized. These issues on higher
dimensional CFTs should deserve further studies.
Last but not least, our approach based on the optimization of path-integrals
is a modest but important step towards understanding of the basic mechanism of
the AdS/CFT correspondence. For the future, apart from the questions we already
mentioned above, there are many new directions for investigations like e.g. compu-
tation of correlation functions, generalizations to non-conformal ﬁeld theories and
understanding a precise connection to AdS/CFT including 1/c expansions etc.

Comparison with Earlier Liouville/3D gravity Relation
Here we would like to compare our Liouville theory obtained from an optimization
of Euclidean path-integrals with the earlier relation [56] between 3D gravity and
Liouville theory. For simplicity we set the AdS radius to unit R = 1 below. We
employ the Chern-Simons description of 3D gravity [63], the two SL(2, R) gauge
ﬁelds A and ¯A correspond to the triad e and spin connection ω via A = ω + e and
¯A = ω −e. If we choose the solution:
A =

−T++(x+)dx+

¯A =

,
(A.1)
we obtain a series of solutions which describe gravitational waves on a pure AdS
space (called Banados geometry) [79]:
ds2 = dr2
r2 −
 r2 + T++T−−r−2
dx+dx−−T++(dx+)2 −T−−(dx−)2.
(A.2)
This satisﬁes the equation of motion iﬀT++ and T−−are functions of x+ and x−
respectively, i.e. ∂−T++ = ∂+T−−= 0. If we set T++ and T−−to be constants, the
geometry becomes a BTZ black hole.
A.1
Review of Earlier Argument
In the paper [56], motivated by the asymptotic behavior of BTZ black hole solutions,
the following gauge choices are imposed: A = (G1)−1dG1 and A = (G2)−1dG2 (note
that there is no bulk degrees of freedom in Chern-Simons gauge theories), where G1
and G2 are expresses as follows
G1 = g1(x+, x−) ·
 √r 0
0
1
√r
!
,
G2 = g2(x+, x−) ·
 
1
√r

0 √r

.
(A.3)
In the above expression g1 and g2 are SL(2, R) matrices and describe the boundary
degrees of freedom. Note that we can show
Ar = −¯Ar

r¯a(−) −¯a(3)

,
where we deﬁned a± = (g1)−1∂+g1 and ¯a± = (g2)−1∂−g2.
Next we impose the
chiral gauge choices a−= ¯a+ = 0.
In this case the gauge theory for A and ¯A
– 48 –

becomes equivalent to the chiral and anti-chiral SL(2, R) WZW model, respectively
[56]. Thus, by combining g1 and g2 as g = g−1
1 g2 we obtain a SL(2, R) WZW model.
If we describe the SL(2, R) group element by
g =
 1 X
0 1
  eφ

0 e−φ
  1 0
Y 1

(A.4)
then the WZW model is described by the action
SWZW =
Z
dx+dx−
2∂+φ∂−φ + 2e−2φ(∂−X)(∂+Y )

.
(A.5)
We can ﬁnd the solutions to the equation of motion for SWZW such that
∂+Y = −α(x+) · e2φ,
∂−X = β(x−) · e2φ,
∂+∂−φ = α(x+)β(x−)e2φ.
(A.6)
Now we set α(x+) = β(x−) = 1 via a coordinate transformation. Note that the ﬁnal
equation in (A.6) coincides with the equation of motion of Liouville theory and this
provides the connection between the 3D gravity and Liouville theory. Finally, the
gauge ﬁeld A and ¯A for this solution read
A =

¯A =

Thus we ﬁnd that the serious of the above solutions correspond to the Banados
geometry (A.2) with the energy stress tensor in the Liouville CFT: T±± = ∂2
±φ −
(∂±φ)2.
A.2
Comparison with Our Approach
Now let us compare the above earlier argument to our metric ansatz (3.19), which
ﬁts naturally with our path-integral optimization argument. We work in Euclidean
signature and consider the Euclidean version of Banados metric (A.2) given by
ds2 = dz2
z2 +
 z2 + T(w) ¯T( ¯w)z−2
dwd ¯w + T(w)dw2 + T( ¯w)d ¯w2.
(A.7)
This metric is mapped into the standard Poincare AdS3 metric ds2 = dη2+dx2+dτ 2
η2
via
τ + ix = A(w) −
z2A′(w)B′′( ¯w)
4A′(w)B′( ¯w) + z2A′′(w)B′′( ¯w),
τ −ix = B( ¯w) −
z2B′( ¯w)A′′(w)
4A′(w)B′( ¯w) + z2A′′(w)B′′( ¯w),
η =
4z(A′(w)B′( ¯w))3/2
4A′(w)B′( ¯w) + z2A′′(w)B′′( ¯w).
(A.8)
– 49 –

Here A and B are holomorphic and anti holomorphic functions, respectively and the
energy stress tensors are expresses as
T(w) = 3A′′(w)2 −2A′(w)A′′′(w)
4A′(w)2
,
¯T( ¯w) = 3B′′( ¯w)2 −2B′( ¯w)B′′′( ¯w)
4B′( ¯w)2
.
(A.9)
On the other hand, the metric (3.19) with the general solution to the Liouville
equation
e2φ =
4A′(y)B′(¯y)
(A(y) + B(¯y))2,
(A.10)
is mapped into the same Poincare AdS3 via the map:
sinh ρ = τ
η,
A(y) + B(¯y) = 2
p
τ 2 + η2,
A(y) −B(¯y) = 2ix.
(A.11)
Note that the energy stress tensor for the Liouville ﬁeld (A.10) agrees with (A.9) as
it should be.
Therefore, by combining (A.8) and (A.11) we obtain a coordinate transformation
between the Banados metric (z, w, ¯w) and our metric (ρ, y, ¯y). Notice that the map
is trivial near the AdS boundary such that y = w + O(z2) and ¯y = ¯w + O(z2) when
z is very small.

Holographic Complexity in the Literature
As mentioned in section 8.5, in this appendix we will consider both CV and CA-
conjectures for the computation of holographic complexity and will explicitly deter-
mine them for some speciﬁc cases like Poincare and global AdS in order to compare
them with our set-up.
In what follows we will summarize the behavior of holographic complexity in
diﬀerent situations and with both the CV and CA conjectures 17.

with the null boundary term found in [31], we see

radius RAdS = 1.

2. Global AdSd+1 : Following the construction in [26] (see appendix C for details)
for global AdSd+1, we note that the leading divergence in CA behaves as

where ϵ is the UV cut-oﬀand Ωd−1 being the volume of unit sphere Sd−1. The
sub-leading contributions include terms starting from 1/ϵd−1, but strikingly
enough the leading term has an additional and stronger logarithmic divergence.
As explained in [26] this comes from one of the joint contributions but suﬀers
from the ambiguity of a parametrization of the null boundary of the WDW
patch, and is denoted by the free parameter α. In [34], a prescription to resolve
this ambiguity was proposed and following their construction we see

Higher Derivatives in Complexity Functional and Anoma-
lies
As was mentioned in section 8.8, in this appendix we would like to explore the pos-
sibility of working with complexity functional Id such that it correctly produces the
anomalies for even dimensional CFTs and hence can be considered as the partition
function Id = log Zd for d-dimensional CFTs.
– 51 –

Motivated by this, we analyze the AdS5/CFT4 case assuming the relation I4 =
log Z4. We will conﬁrm that the equation of motion for the new action again produces
the hyperbolic time slice H4 and moreover its ﬁrst order perturbation agrees with
the AdS5 Schwarzschild black hole solution. The possibility of having extra higher
derivative terms in the action functional can be related to the trace anomaly in CFT4

where W 2 is the square of Weyl tensor and E4(= R2

Euler density in 4-dimensions and µ = z, x1, x2, x3. Also, note the last term can be
taken care of through a local counter term, see [80].
As mentioned before, we restricts ourselves here only to the metrics which are
of the Weyl scaling type (2.5),
gµν = e2φ hﬂat
µν .
(C.2)
with hﬂat
µν corresponding to Euclidean ﬂat space. It can be shown that the action I4,
which correctly reproduces (C.1), becomes


(C.3)
such that α3 = 6a −3b, α4 = −3b, α5 = −4a + 6b and g is the determinant of the
metric gµν in (C.2).
Next we will extremize the action (C.3) for the Poincare and global AdS5 respec-
tively.
C.1
Poincare AdS5 with Higher Derivatives
For the time slice of Poincare AdS5 we consider the form of the metric as given in
(8.10), and with that the action in (C.3) becomes (upto some total derivatives)
I4 =

α1e4φ + α2e2φ(∂zφ)2 −˜b(∂zφ)4 −3b(∂2
zφ)2

,
(C.4)
where we deﬁned ˜b = 3b + 2a and also assumed that φ is a function of z only.
Extremizing the action in (C.4) we demand that the time slice of Poincare AdS5 is
a solution to that. In other words, eφ = ℓ/z extremizes the action if the following
condition is satisﬁed
α1ℓ4 = α2ℓ2 −6a.
(C.5)

C.2
Global AdS5 with Higher Derivatives
For time slice of global AdS5 we again consider the metric as in (8.11) and the
corresponding action functional (C.3), turns out to be

α1e4φ + α2e2φφ′2 −˜bφ′4 + 4˜bφ′2φ′′ −6bφ′′2 −3bφ′φ′′′

(C.6)
where φ′ = ∂rφ and we have also assumed that φ is a function of r only.
It is straightforward to check that eφ = 2ℓ/(1 −r2) is a solution to the equation
of motion for φ obtained by extremizing (C.6), provided
α1ℓ4 = α2ℓ2 −6a,
(C.7)
which is same as (C.5) and hence we prove that the time slice of global AdS5 is
indeed obtained by extremizing (C.6).
C.3
Excitation in Global AdS5 with Higher Derivatives
Consider excited states in CFT4 dual to AdS5 Schwarzschild black holes (8.18). In
Euclidean path integral analysis, we consider a spherically symmetry excitation and
write its metric perturbation as
eφ =


.
(C.8)
Working up to linear order in M, we substitute (C.8) in the equation of motion for
φ that follows from the action in (C.6) and solve for β(r). We use the restriction on
the parameters as in (C.5) for the zeroth order solution. Also demanding that the
solution be regular at r = 1 we check that
β(r) = η(r)
(C.9)
is indeed a allowed solution, where η(r) is given in (8.24). Therefore we conclude
that even in the presence of the higher derivative terms in (C.6), once the condition
(C.5) is maintained the ﬁrst order perturbed metric of the AdS BH agrees with the
extremization of I4.

Entanglement Entropy and Liouville Field
In our approach with the Liouville action and the metric
ds2 = e2φ(z)  dz2 + dx2
,
(D.1)
we compute entanglement entropy as a line integral along the geodesic γ in the
hyperbolic plane that is attached to the endpoints of the interval l
Sl = c
6
Z
γ
eφ(z)ds
(D.2)
– 53 –

and for a general geodesic parametrized by (z(t), x(t)), we have
ds =
√
x′2 + z′2dt.
(D.3)
Moreover, it is important to note that all our ”optimized” vacuum solutions not only
satisfy the Liouville equation but also
∂xφ(z) = ∂zφ(z) + eφ(z) = 0.
(D.4)
Notice also, that because we are interested in the regularized curve, we can just
compute the entanglement entropy by (twice) the integral from the boundary to
some distance in the bulk (turning point of the geodesic). That implies, using (D.4)
Sl ≃c

Z ˜L
ϵ
eφ(z)dz = −c
3
Z ˜L
ϵ
∂zφ(z)dz = −c
3 [φ(z)]
˜L
ϵ
(D.5)
This is clear for the vacuum solution
φ0(z) = −log (z)
(D.6)
and for ˜L = l we obtain the usual result for the entropy.
In general we can consider an arbitrary conformal transformation of the Liouville
ﬁeld of the ”vacuum” by chiral and anti chiral functions (w, ¯w) →(f(w), g( ¯w)).
Under such transformation, Liouville ﬁeld itself transforms as
φ(f, g) = φ(w, ¯w) −1
2 log (f ′(w)g′( ¯w)) .
(D.7)
This is still a solution of the Liouville equation with negative curvature (hyperbolic)
and, in our approach, leads to a particular CFT state. Interestingly, we can then
compute the entanglement entropy for such solution and after the line integral (D.2),
we obtain
Sl = c
12 log
(f(w1) −f(w2))2
f ′(w1)f ′(w2)ϵ2

+ ¯c
12 log
(g( ¯w1) −g( ¯w2))2
g′( ¯w1)g′( ¯w2)ϵ2

.
(D.8)
Curiously, from the general solution of the Liouville equation, we can now see that
that this result itself can also be written as a Liouville ﬁeld and satisﬁes the Liouville
equation but with positive curvature [71] and the space described by the end-points
of the interval. It appears that these two Liouville ﬁelds can obtained form each
other by simple analytic continuation (see also [51]) but the physical signiﬁcance of
this fact is far from obvious and remains to be elucidated.
Nevertheless, given (D.8), we can still apply the ﬁrst law and compute the stress-
tensor. Namely, if we set w2 = w1 + l and ¯w2 = ¯w1 + l, we can expand for small
interval l
Sl = c + ¯c
6
log l
ϵ −l2

 c
12{f(w1), w1} + ¯c
12{g( ¯w1), ¯w1}

where the expressions in the brackets are the Schwarzian derivatives
{f(w), w} = f ′′′(w)
f ′(w) −3
2
f ′′(w)
f ′(w)
2
.
(D.10)
On the other hand, we would like to extract this date from the original Liouville ﬁeld
(hyperbolic) that enters in the optimization procedure. This can be done as follows:
Note that the entropy in the new geometry is computed by
Sl = c
6
Z
γ
eφ(w, ¯w)e−1
2 log(f′(w)g′( ¯w))ds.
(D.11)
If we then consider the exponent of the change in the Liouville ﬁeld, the stress tensor
(Schwarzian derivative) can be read of from the simple equation
∂2
we−1
2 log(f′(w)g′( ¯w)) = −1
2{f(w), w}e−1
2 log(f′(w)g′( ¯w)),
(D.12)
and analogously for g.
