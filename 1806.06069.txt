We introduce a new picture of vacuum decay which, in contrast to existing semiclassical tech-
niques, provides a real-time description and does not rely on classically-forbidden tunneling paths.
Using lattice simulations, we observe vacuum decay via bubble formation by generating realizations
of vacuum ﬂuctuations and evolving with the classical equations of motion. The decay rate ob-
tained from an ensemble of simulations is in excellent agreement with existing techniques. Future
applications include bubble correlation functions, fast decay rates, and decay of non-vacuum states.
Introduction — Field theories with complex interac-
tion potentials arise in a diverse range of physical appli-
cations: from cosmological theories of the multiverse in-
spired by string theory [1, 2], to cold atom Bose-Einstein
condensates [3–5], to the dynamics of protein folding [6].
Such theories generically possess many local potential
minima. At the homogeneous classical level such local
potential minima are stable. However, the uncertainty
principle ensures that spatially-inhomogeneous quantum
ﬂuctuations are present, resulting in the metastablility
of false vacuum ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The decay of false
vacuum states is expected to proceed analogously to ﬁrst-
order phase transitions driven by statistical ﬂuctuations
in condensed matter systems [7, 8], with bubbles of a new
phase nucleating then expanding into the ambient false
vacuum. The prevailing, if implicit, wisdom is that bub-
bles nucleate via non-classical paths in ﬁeld space, analo-
gous to tunneling through a barrier in quantum mechan-
ics [9–16]. We propose an alternative picture of vacuum
decay, in which the classical evolution of the ﬁeld from
some initial realization of the false vacuum ﬂuctuations
leads to the emergence of bubbles. As convenient nomen-
clature, we will refer to these as classically-forbidden and
classically-allowed nucleations, respectively.
We re-examine the nature of bubble nucleations dur-
ing false vacuum decay in relativistic scalar ﬁeld theory
using semiclassical scalar ﬁeld lattice simulations. In our
framework, quantum eﬀects are included by sampling re-
alizations of the initial quantum state of the ﬁeld, then
time-evolving using the classical equations of motion. As
we demonstrate in the supplementary material, this cap-
tures the time-evolution of the wave functional to O(ℏ)
(see also Ref. [17] for a similar derivation). This treat-
ment is analogous to the truncated Wigner approxima-
tion [18, 19] often employed in atomic physics. We ex-
plicitly demonstrate the existence of classically-allowed
paths connecting these initial realizations of the quan-
tum false vacuum, to a subsequent state with nucleated
bubbles of “true vacuum”. This demonstrates that false
vacuum decay can proceed via classically-allowed dynam-
ical evolution. Furthermore, we compare the nucleation
rates inferred using classical statistics for the initial ﬂuc-
tuations (i.e., ignoring quantum interference), and ﬁnd
good agreement with instanton-based predictions which
cannot tackle the time-dependent nature of the prob-
lem. This suggests that the decay of the false vacuum
proceeds via classically-allowed bubble nucleation events.
The supplementary material shows how this approach
can be interpreted as an expansion of the full quantum
dynamics in ℏ.
In this work, we focus on the particular ﬁeld theory
emerging from the cold atom analog false vacuum pro-
posal of Fialko et al [3–5]. However, we do not expect
the presence of classically-allowed decay channels to de-
pend strongly on the speciﬁc choice of ﬁeld theory. The
possible connection to experiment is particularly exciting
in this context, as it provides a window to experimentally
conﬁrm the dynamics of vacuum decay, and possibly un-
cover additional eﬀects arising from quantum interference
such as Anderson localization [20, 21].
Semi-Classical Statistical Formalism — We study
relativistic false vacuum decay using semi-classical sta-
tistical lattice simulations. Throughout we work in units
with ℏ= c = 1. In order to generate suﬃcient statis-
tics to compute decay rates, we will work with ﬁelds in
1 + 1-dimensions, although we do not expect considera-
tion of higher spatial dimensions to qualitatively change
our conclusions.
The ﬁelds are initialized as
φ(x, t = 0) = φfv + δ ˆφ(x)
˙φ(x, t = 0) = δ ˆ˙φ(x) , (1)
where the ﬂuctuations δ ˆφ and δ ˆ˙φ are realizations of
random ﬁelds with the same statistics as the quantum
Minkowski vacuum ﬂuctuations, and φfv is the mean ﬁeld
value in the false vacuum. Using these as initial condi-

tions, we solve Hamilton’s equations
dφ
dt = ˙φ
and
d ˙φ
dt = −∇2φ −V ′(φ)
(2)
with a tenth-order accurate Gauss-Legendre time inte-
grator [22, 23]. The spatial Laplacian is computed using
a Fourier collocation stencil, resulting in periodic bound-
ary conditions.
This combination conserves energy to
O(10−15) with a maximal pointwise error of O(10−13)
as either the grid spacing or time-step is varied. Addi-
tionally, our time-integrator is symplectic so that phase
space volume is preserved. Finally, we veriﬁed that our
numerical simulations are time-reversible. First we in-
tegrate forward in time well into the regime where the
false vacuum has decayed completely. By reversing the
ﬂow of time and backward integrating for an equal time
interval, we are able to recover the initial state of φ and
˙φ to a precision of O(10−15). Further, if we continue to
backward integrate in time, we again see the initial state
decay since the false vacuum is not a true eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian.
This approach does not capture quantum interference
or the contributions of non-classical paths, which as
we demonstrate in the supplementary material enter at
O(ℏ2) in our approach.
Nonetheless, there are many
cases in which this semiclassical approach gives an ac-
curate description of the statistics of the ﬁeld(s). Some
well-known cases include post-inﬂation preheating dy-
namics and relativistic heavy ion collisions [24–28]. In
these standard scenarios, individual Fourier modes be-
come highly squeezed while in the linear regime, thus
entering the classical wave limit and justifying a classical
treatment of the ﬁeld dynamics and statistics. The case
considered here is novel, since once a bubble has formed
in the medium the ﬂuctuations are no longer statistically
homogeneous, and the growth of modes leading to its for-
mation may not occur in the linear regime. However, a
bubble is a highly classical ﬁeld conﬁguration, so we ex-
pect that many aspects will be properly captured by our
simulations. Regardless of how accurately these semiclas-
sical simulations capture the full quantum statistics, they
are more than suﬃcient to demonstrate the existence of
classically-allowed bubble nucleation trajectories.
Classically Allowed Decays — We now use the
framework outlined above to study the dynamics of a
scalar ﬁeld φ initially trapped in a false vacuum. Mo-
tivated by the analog false vacuum setup in cold atom
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems [3–5], we con-
sider the following action

In the BEC experiments, λ is an experimentally tunable
parameter controlling the depth of the false-vacuum well.
For λ > 1, this theory posesses an inﬁnite sequence of
false vacuum extrema at φ = (2k + 1)π with k ∈Z.
Instead, for λ < 1 the false vacua are local maxima of
the potential, and states centered around these points
undergo spinodal decay.
Here, we approximate the initial vacuum ﬂuctuations
as those of a free massive scalar ﬁeld with mass squared

sharp cutoﬀin the spectrum, which must be less than or

given by kn = 2πn
L . The δ ˙φ ﬂuctuations are initialized
analogously.
Figure 1 shows an example classical ﬁeld evolution in
one spatial dimension for a single initial ﬁeld realization
described above.
We see a bubble (i.e., domain wall-
antiwall pair) nucleate from the initial vacuum ﬂuctu-
ations, then subsequently expand into the surrounding
false vacuum. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst explicit
demonstration that bubble nucleation in false vacuum
decay can occur via classically-allowed ﬁeld evolutions in
pure relativistic ﬁeld theory. Aside from the nature of
quantum vs. classical statistics, this is analogous to bub-
ble formation in thermal [29] (or other classical statis-
tical [30]) phase transitions. Thermal nucleation events
are also typically modeled as random, but at a micro-
scopic level the full set of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations (including the
“thermal bath”) are simply following the classical equa-
tions of motion. Bubble nucleations are special classical
trajectories through phase space that describe the coher-
ent creation of a bubble. In the quantum case we are
modeling, the ﬂuctuations instead descend directly from
the initial state of the ﬁeld rather than an external bath.
Let us now consider how to interpret the results of
our simulations. A complete time-dependent description

ﬂuctuations δφ and δ ˙φ are realizations of Gaussian random

strates the existence of classically-allowed paths for false vac-

requires obtaining the wave functional

Z
Dφi⟨φ| ˆU(t|t0)|φi⟩⟨φi(x)|Ψ(t0)⟩
(6)
for the full scalar ﬁeld conﬁguration as a function of time,
given the initial wave-functional |Ψ(t0)⟩. However, any
observer watching the false vacuum boil will not have ac-
cess to the full quantum state of the ﬁeld as encoded in
|Ψ(t)⟩. Rather than seeing a quantum superposition of
nucleation events, such an observer will see Nb bubbles
nucleate with spacetime locations {(xi, ti), i = 1, Nb}. A
priori, we can only predict probabilities for Nb and these
spacetime positions. Given that an actual set of nucle-
ation events has taken place, the observer should be able
to describe the ﬁeld evolution subject to the constraint
of these observed nucleations.
Since the observer will
not have perfect knowledge of the multi-bubble state,
their observations should be marginalized over ﬂuctua-
tions around the constrained ﬁeld path. The result pre-
sented here shows that there exist constrained paths de-
scribing purely classical time-evolution connecting ﬁnal
multi-bubble states directly to realizations of the initial
vacuum ﬂuctuations. Since these classical paths extrem-
ize the action, we expect that they will provide an im-
portant contribution to the propagator determining the
evolution of the wave-functional.
To contrast our approach, let us instead brieﬂy con-
sider the standard Euclidean (i.e., instanton) formal-
ism [9, 10, 14]. We Wick-rotate to Euclidean time, then
search for extremal paths of the Euclidean action con-
necting the false vacuum at inﬁnity to the true vac-
uum at the origin.
These extremal paths are known
as bounce solutions. Nearly all existing treatments as-
sume the bounce is spherically-symmetric in Euclidean
signature. This dramatically reduces the phase space of
allowed ﬁeld conﬁgurations, simplifying it to a quantum
mechanics problem.
Nearly all existing treatments as-
sume the bounce is spherically-symmetric. In Lorentzian
signature, the bounce describes a spherically-symmetric
bubble that contracts from inﬁnite size in the distant
past, reaches a minimum turnaround radius, and then
re-expands.
The nucleation event itself is modeled by
artiﬁcially removing the contracting phase, then pasting
the remaining expanding phase into the ambient space-
time.
The pasting step is interpreted as a classically-
forbidden quantum tunneling process, analogous to the
decay of an unstable particle in quantum mechanics.
However, the tunneling interpretation is fueled by anal-
ogy with quantum mechanics, which as mentioned above
requires a drastic reduction in the allowed phase space
for the ﬁeld evolution. We have demonstrated that the
neglected ﬂuctuations can play a pivotal role around
the time of nucleation, and allow for bubbles to nucle-
ate via classically-allowed trajectories. Speciﬁc ﬂuctua-
tion conﬁgurations that may lead to bubble formation
are: (1) local peaks or valleys in the initial ﬂuctuations
around the false vacuum that probe the nonlinear struc-
ture of the potential and act as bubble nucleation seeds,
or (2) the repeated mildly nonlinear interactions of prop-
agating waves that eventually lead to the development of
a local ﬁeld peak from which a bubble may form. The
latter eﬀect means that energy within a small region may
not be conserved due to energy transport via currents.
False Vacuum Decay Rates — Thus far, we showed
the existence of classically-allowed paths through ﬁeld
space describing false vacuum decay via bubble nucle-
ation.
Given such paths exist, we expect they play
an important part in the false vacuum decay process.
They may either be a competing process with classically-
forbidden bubble nucleations; or, given the drastic di-
mensional reduction used in the Euclidean formalism,
may actually be a more complete description of the de-
cays captured by instanton techniques.
To investigate
this issue, we estimate the bubble nucleation rate using
our real-time simulations and compare it with the instan-
ton predictions.

In addition, φB(rE = 0) should
be near the true vacuum, and the solution should pos-
sess a single negative eigenmode to give an imaginary
contribution to the Euclidean eﬀective action [31].

The factor of 2 accounts for the independent instanton
decay paths in this model.
As is clear from Fig. 1, the emergence of a bubble is
a “fuzzy” process which makes a precise determination
of the nucleation time somewhat ambiguous. We there-
fore adopt the following operational deﬁnition. Imagine
an ensemble of observers each watching a ﬁnite region of
the false vacuum boil. We ask each of these observers to
provide us with a history of ⟨cos φ⟩V within their region,
where ⟨·⟩V represents a spatial average. To obtain statis-
tics, we make one additional assumption — each ﬁeld
trajectory (and thus each observer) is weighted by the
probability of the initial realization of the ﬂuctuations.
In the particular case considered here, where we assume
the initial state is Gaussian and draw samples from an
ensemble of Gaussian random ﬁelds, each simulation is
weighted equally. We select a threshold, and declare that
the observer’s region has decayed at the ﬁrst passage of
⟨cos φ⟩V past this threshold. To reduce the eﬀects of mul-
tiple bubbles and ﬂuctuations, we choose the threshold
to be ¯cT+nσ∆cT for some constant nσ. Here ¯cT and ∆cT
are, respectively, the ensemble average and standard de-
viation of ⟨cos φ⟩V on the initial time slice. We then run
ensembles of 5000 lattice simulations with varying φ0 and
side length L for λ = 1.2, and empirically determine the
fraction of undecayed trajectories Fsurvive(t). We veriﬁed
Fsurvive is insensitive to the choices of both the lattice

ter an initial transient that depends on the simulation

decay. We ﬁt this exponential tail Fsurvive = e−Γ(t−to)

veriﬁed that Γ

In Fig. 2 we compare the decay rates extracted from
our simulations with those of the instanton formalism
(obtained using the method of Ref. [32]). We also include
the leading order prediction to compare to an exponen-
tial falloﬀat large φ0. To capture all relevant dynam-
ical modes, we set the spectral cutoﬀkcut = 1024π

the bounce proﬁle φB dropped below 10−15.
In this
regime, increasing kcut should simply renormalize the
ﬁeld theory. Given the unknown determinant prefactor,
exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the bounce
action, and multi-bubble and ﬂuctuation eﬀects entering
into our decay time extraction, our simulations match the
instanton prediction very well. In particular, the ampli-
tude is the correct order of magnitude, and the rate of
exponential decay at large φ0 closely matches the Eu-
clidean calculation.
We also varied λ at ﬁxed φ2
0C(λ) and found the time-
evolution of the survival fraction to be nearly indepen-
dent of the choice of λ.
This suggests not only that
classically-allowed decay paths are a key process in false
vacuum decay, but also that these classically-allowed
paths may be the same ones being captured by the stan-
dard instanton calculation. In order to address this latter
issue, the results presented here motivate a deeper inves-
tigation of the function g, renormalization eﬀects, and a

5
more sophisticated bubble extraction algorithm.
Conclusions — We outlined a novel real-time frame-
work to study quantum false vacuum decay, based on
semi-classical stochastic lattice simulations.
This pro-
vides a step towards incorporating the full temporal evo-
lution of a decaying region of the false vacuum. In partic-
ular, we demonstrated that the false vacuum can decay
via bubble nucleation along classically-allowed ﬁeld tra-
jectories, and the decay rates of such decays agree well
with standard computations based on the instanton for-
malism. This suggests that our formalism provides a de-
scription of the “fuzzy” process of a bubble nucleating
in false vacuum. We will explore how our interpretation
generalizes to other systems of non-equilibrium bubble
formation in a forthcoming work.
One particularly exciting prospect is the possiblity of
emulating the false vacuum decay process with cold atom
systems, suggesting we may be able to experimentally
test the picture outlined here [3–5]. In addition, our ap-
proach opens new avenues of investigation which cannot
be addressed within the Euclidean framework. These in-
clude decay rates from non-vacuum initial states, inves-
tigation of bubble-bubble correlations, and evolution in
a regime of rapid decays. Furthermore, the emergence of
a classical bubble from a highly quantum initial state is
an example of self-decoherence of a quantum ﬁeld, and
may yield insight into the process by which eﬀectively
classical density perturbations arise from quantum ﬂuc-
tuations during inﬂation [33–36]. Finally, the emergence
of a classical bubble from the quantum vacuum bears
many similarities to the process of “measuring” a bub-
ble nucleation event, and may shed light on the notion
of measurement in quantum ﬁeld theory and quantum
cosmology [37].

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: SEMICLASSICAL STATISTICAL SIMULATIONS AS EVOLUTION OF
THE WIGNER FUNCTIONAL
In this supplementary material, we demonstrate that the statistical lattice simulations employed in the main text
is equivalent to quantum dynamics to ﬁrst order in an expansion in ℏ. A similar derivation can be found in Ref. [17]
Consider the Wigner functional
W[φ, Π] =
Z

(10)
which is normalized as
Z
DφDΠ W[φ, Π] = 1 ,
(11)
where we have absorbed some factors of 2π into the deﬁnition of DΠ. Using W, expectation values of an operator
ˆO(ˆφ, ˆΠ) are obtained from
⟨ˆO(ˆφ, ˆΠ)⟩=
Z
DφDΠ W[φ, Π]OW(φ, Π)
(12)
where OW(φ, Π) is the Wigner symbol of O. For a fully symmetrized operator, OW is obtained by simply replacing
the quantum operators ˆφ and ˆΠ by classical functions. Thus, the Wigner functional acts as a quantum probability
distribution on phase space, although one should bear in mind that it is not always positive deﬁnite. However, for a
Gaussian state, the Wigner function is positive deﬁnite and the probability interpretation holds.
Consider a theory with Hamiltonian density of the form

where ←−∂φ acts only on the potential and δ/δΠ acts on the Wigner functional. Expanding the sine term arising from
the potential in ℏ, we obtain

Therefore, to O(ℏ2) in the dynamical evolution, we can solve for W using the method of characteristics, with each
characteristic satisfying the classical equations of motion from some initial φ and Π conﬁguration.
This cleanly
factorizes the eﬀects of quantum mechanics into: (1) a contribution from the initial ﬂuctuation statistics encoded
in W[φ, Π, t = 0], and (2) O(ℏ2) and higher modiﬁcations to the classical dynamical evolution. Our approach thus
corresponds to this approximation, with the initial state approximated as a Gaussian. Since the initial ﬂuctuation
spectra are set by commutation relations between φ and Π, in this formalism the leading quantum correction in ℏ
arises from the initial form of W, rather than due to dynamical evolution. Note the crucial role the existence of
classically-allowed false vacuum decay paths plays in the utility of this approach.
When considering Fig. 2, note that the instanton calculation is also an expansion in ℏ. The leading eﬀect arises
from the action on the instanton trajectory e−SI, while the ﬂuctuation determinant gives the ﬁrst quantum correction
(including renormalization eﬀects). Thus, both the curves are approximations to the true tunneling rate and a careful
calculation of the determinant prefactor could bring them into even better agreement.
