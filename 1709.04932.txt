Abstract
We derive the nonlinear sigma model as a peculiar dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theory.
In this framework, pions are reformulated as higher-dimensional gluons arranged in a kinematic
conﬁguration that only probes cubic interactions. This procedure yields a purely cubic action
for the nonlinear sigma model that exhibits a symmetry enforcing color-kinematics duality.
Remarkably, the associated kinematic algebra originates directly from the Poincaré algebra
in higher dimensions. Applying the same construction to gravity yields a new quartic action
for Born-Infeld theory and, applied once more, a cubic action for the special Galileon theory.
Since the nonlinear sigma model and special Galileon are subtly encoded in the cubic sectors
of Yang-Mills theory and gravity, respectively, their double copy relationship is automatic.

Introduction
Recent work [1] has demonstrated how gravity encodes a uniﬁed description of Yang-Mills (YM)
theory, the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), Born-Infeld (BI) theory, and the special Galileon (SG)
theory [2–4], as originally anticipated in the context of the Cachazo-He-Yuan formalism [3, 5, 6].
In particular, the tree-level S-matrices of these theories can be “transmuted” from that of gravity
via simple operators that act as diﬀerentials on the space of kinematic invariants.
In this paper, we argue that the amplitudes construction derived in Ref. [1] is equivalent to
a peculiar version of dimensional reduction and can be implemented at the level of the action.
Physically, our construction recasts pions as gluons in a special kinematic conﬁguration in higher
dimensions, thus reformulating the NLSM in d dimensions as a particular dimensional reduction of
YM theory in 2d + 1 dimensions. The resulting description coincides precisely with one recently
proposed in Ref. [7], where the NLSM action is comprised purely of cubic interactions exhibiting
an explicit symmetry that maintains color-kinematics duality [8].
Furthermore, by applying our dimensional reduction to gravity in 2d+1 dimensions, we obtain a
new action for BI theory in d dimensions. In this representation, the interaction vertices truncate at
quartic order. Applying this operation again to BI then yields the cubic double copy action for SG
proposed in Ref. [7], which is term-by-term the square of the NLSM action previously mentioned.
As our dimensional reduction eﬀectively projects out all quartic interactions in the NLSM,
pion scattering originates entirely from the cubic topologies of gluon scattering. This eﬀect oﬀers
some insight into the physical origins of double copy relations [8–10]. Since the cubic sector of
gravity is trivially the square of that of YM theory, the double copy relationship is inherited by the
SG and NLSM. This is reminiscent of the manifestation of the double copy in self-dual YM and
gravity [11], but applicable in general spacetime dimension. Remarkably, by deriving the NLSM
action in Ref. [7] directly from YM theory, we learn that the associated kinematic algebra is actually
a direct descendant of the higher-dimensional Poincaré algebra.
While these new actions manifest the hidden relations ﬁrst found in tree-level amplitudes, they
display some unconventional traits that diﬀerentiate them from the standard action formulations
of the quantum ﬁeld theories we consider. In particular, these actions are typically taken to be
functions of a single physical ﬁeld, so properties like Bose symmetry and S-matrix unitarity are
obvious. However, as discovered in Ref. [7], the new NLSM action that makes the double copy
relationship explicit involves more than one type of ﬁeld: there are additional auxiliary ﬁelds present
that obscure the underlying Bose symmetry and S-matrix unitarity (e.g., tree-level factorization).
The usual NLSM tree amplitudes are reproduced as a speciﬁc choice of external states in this
new formulation. The auxiliary ﬁelds in our actions—and amplitudes going beyond this prescribed
choice of external states—do not have any clear physical signiﬁcance.
Accordingly, the action
representations we derive in this paper are physical in the sense that they reproduce the correct
3

tree-level scattering amplitudes when our prescribed choices of external states are made.
The construction of alternative tree-level representations of quantum ﬁeld theories with auxiliary
states has helped in understanding the double copy and simplifying the perturbation theory [7, 12].
As in the case of the double copy itself, the question of whether this construction extends to
loop order is nontrivial and will likely involve the introduction of ghost ﬁelds, so we leave this
question for future work. When restricted to the external states that are relevant to pion scattering,
Ref. [1] proved that both properties are present at the level of amplitudes using on-shell recursion
relations [13–15], though a more direct physical understanding is still missing. In the present paper,
we design the special type of dimensional reduction precisely to realize the transmutation in Ref. [1],
so permutation invariance and unitarity follow from the proof therein.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we summarize the results of
Ref. [1], which deﬁned a set of unifying relations connecting scattering amplitudes across a spectrum
of theories. We then discuss the action-level representation of this operation for the NLSM in Sec. 3,
followed by its implications for color-kinematics duality. Finally, we apply this construction to the
gravity action to derive BI theory and the SG in Sec. 4 and conclude in Sec. 5.

Amplitudes Preamble
In this section, we review the mechanics of transmutation at the level of scattering amplitudes [1]
and show how it is equivalent to a certain implementation of dimensional reduction.
2.1
Unifying Relations for Amplitudes
Consider a tree-level color-ordered scattering amplitude in YM theory. As proven in Ref. [1], gluons
can be transmuted into pions via a simple diﬀerential operation,
∂
∂(e1en)
n−1
Y
i=2

X
j̸=i
pipj
∂
∂(pjei)

A(g1, · · · , gn) = A(π1, · · · , πn),
(1)
where pipj, piej, and eiej are Lorentz invariant products of the momenta and polarization vectors
and the YM color structure on the left-hand side is mapped to the NLSM ﬂavor structure on
the right-hand side. As required by little group covariance, the transmutation operator eﬀectively
strips oﬀall polarization vectors in order to generate an amplitude of scalars.
The very same
transmutation operator also converts tree-level amplitudes of BI photons into those of SG scalars,
∂
∂(e1en)
n−1
Y
i=2

X
j̸=i
pipj
∂
∂(pjei)

A(γ1, · · · , γn) = A(φ1, · · · , φn).
(2)
Crucially, Eqs. (1) and (2) apply to amplitudes in any representation, provided they are written
as a function of kinematic invariants in general spacetime dimension. This is possible because the
4

transmutation operators are precisely engineered to be invariant under reshuﬄing of terms via total
momentum conservation and on-shell conditions [1].
Note that the right-hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (2) are manifestly cyclic and permutation invariant,
respectively, while the left-hand sides are not. This feature is generic: while transmutation selects
two special legs, chosen here to be 1 and n, the ﬁnal answer is independent of this choice. As we
will see, the absence of manifest cyclic and permutation invariance will persist at the action level.
In Ref. [1] it was shown how transmutation also applies to gravity—or more precisely, the low-
energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the closed string, which describes gravity coupled to a dilaton and
two-form gauge ﬁeld. Throughout, we will for brevity refer to this multiplet of states collectively
as the “extended graviton.”1 The extended graviton amplitudes are a function of non-symmetric
tensor polarizations, eµν = eµeν, and are the natural output of various “gravity = gauge2” relations
arising from the BCJ [8] and KLT [17] constructions. Transmuting the extended graviton amplitude
yields the scattering amplitude of BI photons,
∂
∂(e1en)
n−1
Y
i=2

X
j̸=i
pipj
∂
∂(pjei)

A(H1, · · · , Hn) = A(γ1, · · · , γn).
(3)
Here the transmutation operator only strips oﬀthe barred polarizations, so the resulting expression
is still a function of the unbarred polarizations labeling the external BI photons. Combined with
Eq. (2), Eq. (3) shows that applying the transmutation twice to an extended graviton amplitude
leads to that of SG.
2.2
Transmutation as Special Kinematics
The transmutation procedure outlined above is actually equivalent to a certain variation of dimen-
sional reduction. To understand why, we ﬁrst examine the case of pions transmuted from gluons,
as described in Eq. (1). With the beneﬁt of hindsight, let us deﬁne a theory of (2d+1)-dimensional
gluons dimensionally reduced to a d-dimensional subspace on which the external momenta have
support. The (2d + 1)-dimensional momentum vector for a massless gluon is
PM
i
= (pµ
i , 0, 0),
(4)
expressed in block form where the ﬁrst and third entries are d-dimensional and the middle entry
is one-dimensional. Throughout, we use calligraphic indices to label the full (2d + 1)-dimensional
space and, Greek indices to label both sets of d-dimensional spaces. It is important to point out
that this latter choice of indices is simply a convenient abuse of notation; we do not identify the
two d-dimensional spaces.
1The theory of gravity coupled to a dilaton and a two-form gauge ﬁeld has several aliases, including “N = 0
supergravity” and the theory of the “fat graviton.” [16]
5

By inspection, we see that Eq. (1) is equivalent to the following choice of external polarizations,
EM
1
= EM
n
= (0, 1, 0)
and
EM
i
= (pµ
i , 0, i pµ
i )
for
i ̸= 1, n.
(5)
This is merely a choice of polarization and the two d-dimensional spaces remain independent space-
time directions. In order to verify this claim it suﬃces to compute the kinematic invariants corre-
sponding to Eqs. (4) and (5). For example, the invariants built purely from momenta are
PiPj = pipj.
(6)
Meanwhile, since the polarizations of legs 1 and n are orthogonal to all other legs, we ﬁnd that
E1En = 1,
(7)
while EiEj = 0 for all other combinations due to crucial factors of the imaginary number i in Eq. (5).
Finally, the invariants constructed from polarizations and momenta are
PiEj = pipj
for
j /∈{1, n},
(8)
with PiE1 = PiEn = 0. Hence, this choice of external kinematics implements precisely the diﬀerential
operator in Eq. (1). To obtain this result, it was important that the gluon amplitude is linear in
each of the polarization vectors.
The choice of kinematics in Eqs. (4) and (5) describes a dimensional reduction from 2d + 1
dimensions down to d dimensions. Physically, legs 1 and n are polarized in their own exclusive
extra dimension, while legs 2 through n −1 describe polarizations residing in the d-dimensional
subspaces that are proportional to the physical d-dimensional momentum. In subsequent sections,
we translate this special kinematic conﬁguration into an operation at the level of the action.
3
From Gluons to Pions
Let us now apply the dimensional reduction described in the previous section to derive the NLSM
from YM theory. For YM theory in 2d + 1 dimensions, the Lagrangian is
LYM = −1
4Tr

FMNFMN 
+ LGF
with
FMN = ∂MAN −∂NAM −i
√
2 [AM, AN] ,
(9)
in units where the gauge coupling g = 2 and the gluon ﬁelds AM = Aa
MT a are adjoint-valued under
a normalization convention where
Tr

T aT b
= δab
and
[T a, T b] = i
√
2 f abcT c.
(10)
For simplicity we implement Feyman gauge by choosing
LGF = −1
2Tr

∂MAM∂NAN 
,
(11)
6

so the full action is equal to
LYM = Tr

−1
2∂MAN∂MAN + i
√
2 ∂MAN[AM, AN] + 1
2[AM, AN][AM, AN]

.
(12)
In what follows, we prove how the YM action reduces to the NLSM action in Ref. [7] on the
dimensional reduction corresponding to Eq. (5).
3.1
Dimensional Reduction to the Nonlinear Sigma Model
According to Eq. (5), the gluon ﬁeld AM is split into the component ﬁelds
AM = XM + YM + ZM,
(13)
which without loss of generality can be parameterized by
XM = 1
√
2(Xµ, 0, −iXµ)
YM = (0, Y, 0)
ZM = 1
√
2(Zµ, 0, +iZµ),
(14)
where Xµ and Zµ are d-dimensional vectors and Y is a scalar. Since we still have the same degrees
of freedom, this is merely a change of basis. As previously mentioned, we are not identifying the
two d-dimensional spaces and will be consistently contracting indices separately in the two factors.
We assume a ﬂat (2d + 1)-dimensional metric, which takes the block form2
ηMN =



ηµν
0
0
0
1
0
0
0
ηµν


,
(15)
so the square of the gluon ﬁeld is
AMAM = XµZµ + ZµXµ + Y 2.
(16)
By construction, XM and ZM have the form of polarizations of opposite helicity. As a result, we
obtain the useful identities
XMX M = ZMZM = 0
XMYM = ZMYM = 0
(17)
and similarly for all analogous expressions involving derivatives on ﬁelds. Finally, we note that,
in accordance with Eq. (4), the ﬁelds are polarized in the full (2d + 1)-dimensional space but only
carry momentum in the ﬁrst d spacetime dimensions, so
∂M = (∂µ, 0, 0).
(18)
2Note that both d-dimensional spacetime factors are separately in Lorentzian mostly-plus signature while the
single extra dimension is spatial.
7

Expanding the YM action in terms of Xµ, Y , and Zµ, we obtain
LYM = L(2)
YM + L(3)
YM + L(4)
YM,
(19)
where the terms at each power in ﬁelds are
L(2)
YM = Tr
 
Xµ□Zµ + 1
2Y □Y
!
L(3)
YM = i Tr
 
∂µXν [Zµ, Zν] + Xµ [∂νZµ, Zν] + Zµ [Y, ∂µY ]

+ {Xµ ↔Zµ}
L(4)
YM = Tr
 
[Xµ, Zν] [Zµ, Xν] + [Xµ, Xν] [Zµ, Zν] + 2 [Xµ, Y ] [Zµ, Y ]
!
.
(20)
Remarkably, one can consistently drop the majority of terms in the action (20) because they do
not actually contribute to tree-level pion scattering. This truncation is possible as a consequence
of two important simpliﬁcations, which we now discuss.
Weight Counting
First of all, let us determine which interaction vertices actually enter into the tree-level Feynman di-
agrams for pion scattering. According to Eq. (5), pion scattering corresponds to higher-dimensional
gluon scattering where legs 1 and n are Y particles and all other states are longitudinally-polarized
Zµ particles. In particular, the latter states all have polarizations proportional to their respective
momenta pµ. At the level of the amplitude, we have
A(π1, π2, . . . , πn−1, πn) = A(Y1, Z2, . . . , Zn−1, Yn),
(21)
which incidentally matches the prescription proposed in Ref. [7].
As it turns out, since the external states are restricted to longitudinal Zµ states and a pair of Y
states, this severely limits which interactions can contribute to the amplitude. By drawing tree-level
Feynman diagrams explicitly, it becomes obvious that none of the quartic interactions can appear.
Since we are interested in the NLSM, it is desirable to further simplify the action in order to make
the color-kinematics duality manifest, as in Ref. [7].
To systematically enumerate which interactions in Eq. (20) can appear in a tree-level scattering
amplitude for the NLSM according to the external states speciﬁed by Eq. (21), we deﬁne a “pseudo-
helicity” for each external particle type,
h[Xµ] = −1,
h[Y ] = 0,
h[Zµ] = +1.
(22)
In analogy with helicity in four dimensions, it is natural to deﬁne the holomorphic weight of an
operator, w = n −h, where n is the total number of particles in the operator and h is the sum of
all pseudo-helicities in the operator. At tree level, there is a simple addition rule for the weights.
8

This is because the weights satisfy w[A] = w[AL] + w[AR] −2 for an amplitude on its factorization
channel, A ∼ALAR. For an in-depth discussion of weight counting in general, see Ref. [18]. The
weight of each component ﬁeld is
w[Xµ] = +2,
w[Y ] = +1,
w[Zµ] = 0,
(23)
so each term in the action in Eq. (20) has weight
w
h
L(2)
YM
i
= +2,
w
h
L(3)
YM
i
= +2, +4,
w
h
L(4)
YM
i
= +4.
(24)
We thus learn that every term in the Lagrangian has weight w ≥+2. However, since the pion
scattering amplitude contains all Zµ states except for a pair of Y states, the target amplitude
has weight w = +2. This implies that pion amplitudes only receive contributions from w = +2
interactions, so it is consistent to entirely drop all terms in the Lagrangian with weight w > +2. The
resulting truncated action is Eq. (20) with all the quartic terms and half the cubic terms dropped,
LNLSM = Tr
 
Xµ□Zµ + 1
2Y □Y + i

∂µXν [Zµ, Zν] + Xµ [∂νZµ, Zν] + Zµ [Y, ∂µY ]
!
.
(25)
This action is similar but not yet equal to the NLSM action proposed in Ref. [7].
Transverse Condition
To establish complete equivalence requires a second simpliﬁcation of the action that arises from
certain transverse properties of the ﬁelds. First, we rewrite Eq. (25), up to total derivatives, as
LNLSM = Tr
 
Xµ□Zµ + 1
2Y □Y + i

Xµν [Zµ, Zν] + Zµ [Y, ∂µY ]
!
+ O(∂µZµ),
(26)
where we have deﬁned the ﬁeld strength for the Xµ ﬁeld,
Xµν = ∂µXν −∂νXµ.
(27)
The action in Eq. (26) diﬀers from that of Ref. [7] by terms proportional to the longitudinal com-
ponent, ∂µZµ. As we now show, these terms are always projected out of tree-level pion amplitudes
and can be consistently dropped. To understand why, consider a factor of ∂µZµ that appears in
an interaction contributing to a Feynman diagram. If the Zµ ﬁeld contracts into an external state,
then it vanishes by the on-shell conditions. On the other hand, if the Zµ ﬁeld is contracted with
an internal propagator, then the oﬀ-diagonal structure of the kinetic term links this ﬁeld to the
Xµ ﬁeld of some internal vertex. According to Eq. (26), all interaction vertices that involve Xµ
are either a function of the ﬁeld strength Xµν or are proportional to ∂µZµ. In the former case,
the ﬁeld strength Xµν simply zeroes out this longitudinal contribution. In the latter, the internal
vertex is also proportional to the longitudinal component ∂µZµ, so we can then apply the same logic
9

from the beginning. Thus, all factors of ∂µZµ ultimately terminate at an external leg or on an Xµν
ﬁeld strength. Because these contributions vanish, all factors of ∂µZµ can be consistently dropped
from the action, thus establishing the equivalence of Eq. (26) with the result of Ref. [7], which was
originally derived from scattering amplitudes rather than dimensional reduction.
In terms of Feynman diagrams, the perturbation expansion for the action in Eq. (26) is drastically
simpler than that of the conventional representation of the NLSM action,
LNLSM = −f 2
π
2 Tr
h
∂µU −1∂µU
i
,
(28)
where U = exp(iπaT a/fπ) and fπ is the pion decay constant. The exponential form of the nonlinear
ﬁeld generates an inﬁnite tower of higher- and higher-order interactions that contribute unnecessary
complexity to the Feynman diagrammatic expansion, and obscures the color-kinematics duality in
NLSM [19–24]. In contrast, the NLSM representation in Eq. (26) is purely cubic and manifests the
color-kinematics duality inherits from YM. Note that the pion decay constant is absorbed into the
normalization of the longitudinal polarizations of the Zµ external states.
3.2
Color-Ordered Formulation
For future reference, we summarize here the color-ordered Feynman rules derived from the NLSM
action in Eq. (26). Since we are in Feynman gauge, the propagators take the simple form,
Y
Y
=
−i
p2
Zµ
X⌫
=
−i
p2ηµν,
(29)
where the Xµ and Zµ ﬁelds are conjugate particles. The three-particle Feynman vertices are

1ηρµ −pρ
1ηµν)
Zµ

Y3
Y2

(30)
which are far simpler to implement than Feynman rules in the conventional approach to perturbation
theory in the NLSM [25, 26]. Recall the NLSM amplitude is given by the states chosen in Eq. (21).
10

Note that the color-ordered formulation naturally arises from YM action in the Gervais-Neveu
gauge [27],
LYM = Tr

−1
2∂MAN∂MAN −2
√
2i ∂MANAMAN + AMANAMAN

,
(31)
which is dimensionally reduced to
LNLSM = Tr
 
Xµ□Zµ + 1
2Y □Y + 2i XµνZµZν + 2i ZµY ∂µY
!
,
(32)
up to terms that may be consistently dropped as a consequence of weight counting or the transverse
condition discussed previously.
For the sake of completeness, we also remind the readers that the tree-level pion amplitudes
are reproduced by the amplitudes in Eq. (21). According to the special kinematics in Eq. (5), the
d-dimensional polarizations for Z particles are chosen as the longitudinal mode, ϵµ
Z = pµ. Note that
the choice of longitudinal polarization does not contradict with the transverse condition discussed
earlier. The transverse condition applies to the irrelevance of interactions proportional to ∂µZµ
which has nothing to do with the choice of polarization ϵµ
Z.
3.3
Kinematic Algebra as Poincaré Algebra
As emphasized in Ref. [7], the Feynman diagrams associated with the NLSM action in Eq. (25)
automatically satisfy the Jacobi identities and are thus manifestly compliant with color-kinematics
duality. Remarkably, the Jacobi identities are enforced by a symmetry of the NLSM action,

θν
Z∂νZµ −∂νθZµZν


,
(33)
where θXµν = ∂µθXν −∂νθXµ. In particular, the Noether current conservation equations for these
symmetries are literally equal to the Jacobi identities for kinematic numerators, modulo terms that
vanish under the transverse conditions discussed earlier.
As noted in Ref. [7], the δZ transformations are simply Poincaré transformations acting on the
d-dimensional subspace. This is obvious if we identify θµ
Z = aµ +bµνxν, where a is a constant vector
labeling translations and b is a constant antisymmetric matrix labeling rotations and boosts.
But what of the remaining symmetries, δX and δY ? By recasting the NLSM as a dimensional
reduction of YM, we learn that these symmetries have a geometric origin—namely, Lorentz boosts
11

in higher dimensions! Concretely, consider a matrix parameterizing a Lorentz transformation acting
on the extra-dimensional space,
ΛMN =




0
i
√
2θY ν
0
−i
√
2θY µ
−2θXµν


.
(34)
These transformations act rigidly on the indices of ﬁelds and do not involve derivatives because there
are no momenta ﬂowing in the extra dimensions. The extra-dimensional Lorentz transformation
shifts the gluon ﬁeld by AM →AM + ˜δAM, which in terms of the component ﬁelds is
˜δX






θY µY
θY µ(Xµ −Zµ)
−θY µY


.
(35)
At present, these symmetries still diﬀer from Eq. (33). However, as discussed earlier, the NLSM is
deﬁned by a truncated version of the YM action. As a result of the truncation, a symmetry in YM
is not guaranteed to be a symmetry of the NLSM.
Nevertheless, a close descendant of the extra-dimensional Lorentz symmetry is still preserved
under weight truncation. To see why, recall that the original YM action can be partitioned into
two weight sectors, LYM = L(w=2)
YM
+ L(w=4)
YM
. The transformations in Eq. (35) shift the weights of
the component ﬁelds by
w
h˜δX
i
= 0, ±2
and
w
h˜δY
i
= ±1,
(36)
so extra-dimensional Lorentz transformations mix terms of diﬀerent weight. In order to determine
the component of the Lorentz transformation that leaves L(w=2)
YM
invariant, we simply drop all trans-
formations that are an invariance only with the help of L(w=4)
YM
. These transformations can never be
symmetries of the truncated action. On the other hand, for transformations that shift the weights
strictly negatively, it is impossible for any variation of L(w=4)
YM
to ever cancel a variation in L(w=2)
YM
because these terms are already separated in weight. Thus, for a negative shift in weight, L(w=2)
YM
will be itself invariant. Truncating the symmetry transformation in Eq. (35) down to terms that
shift the weight by −1 and −2, we obtain the color-kinematics symmetry of the NLSM shown
in Eq. (33). In summary, color-kinematics duality in the NLSM arises from a higher-dimensional
spacetime symmetry of YM theory.

From Gravitons to Photons and Galileons
The construction described above can be applied straightforwardly to gravity. However, as discussed
in Ref. [1], the natural theory to which to apply transmutation is the low-energy eﬀective theory of
12

the closed string. The action, SG =
´
dDx LG, describes a metric gMN coupled to an antisymmetric
two-form BMN and a dilaton φ, with interactions given by
LG = √−g

(37)
where κ2 = 32πG. In the conventional picture, one expands the graviton in perturbations,
gMN = ηMN + κhMN,
(38)
treating hMN, BMN, and φ as distinct ﬁelds. For our purposes, however, it will be convenient to
repackage the degrees of freedom into a single extended graviton ﬁeld described by a general tensor
HMN. An action of this form was derived in Ref. [12] in the context of pure gravity, but in fact
also reproduces all extended graviton amplitudes as well. Unfortunately, the associated propagator
deviates from the simple 1/p2 Feynman propagator form, so we will not consider the action of
Ref. [12] further here.
An action-level version of transmutation requires an extended graviton action expressed in terms
of HMN with a simple propagator going as 1/p2. To derive such an action, we build a general ansatz
for an eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the extended graviton HMN and constrain its coeﬃcients to match
known tree-level amplitudes constructed from the KLT relations [17]. Among the family of resulting
actions, we choose the remaining free coeﬃcients to simplify our results by reducing the number of
terms in the Lagrangian. In natural units where κ = 1, our resulting extended graviton action is
LG = L(2)

4.1
Dimensional Reduction to Born-Infeld Theory
Next, let us implement the procedure described in the above sections to derive the BI action from
the extended graviton action in Eqs. (39) and (40). We take the unbarred and barred indices in
the extended graviton action to run over d dimensions and 2d + 1 dimensions, respectively, so the
extended graviton ﬁeld is a d × (2d + 1) matrix,
HµN = XµN + YµN + ZµN,
(41)
where each component ﬁeld is given by
XµN = 1
√
2(Xµ¯ν, 0, −iXµ¯ν)
YµN = (0, Yµ, 0)
ZµN = 1
√
2(Zµ¯ν, 0, +iZµ¯ν).
(42)
These deﬁnitions enforce a similar nilpotency condition as before,
XµRX R
ν
= ZµRZ R
ν
= 0
XµRY R
ν
= ZµRY R
ν
= 0,
(43)
and likewise for terms involving derivatives. We also note that the derivatives only have support
on the d-dimensional subspace, so
∂M = (∂µ, 0, 0)
and
∂M = (∂¯µ, 0, 0).
(44)
Plugging into the extended graviton action in Eq. (40), we obtain a new action for the BI theory,
LBI = L(2)
BI + L(3)
BI + L(4)
BI ,
(45)
where the terms at each power are given by
L(2)

(46)
Here we have dropped all interactions at quintic order and higher because they can be truncated
by a weight counting argument that will be discussed shortly. Moreover, we have separated oﬀ
terms proportional to ∂¯νZµ¯ν because they can be discarded due to an analogue of the transverse
conditions discussed earlier.
14

Weight Counting
Our earlier weight counting arguments are straightforwardly generalized to the case of gravity. Since
the dimensional reduction is only applied to the barred indices, the weights are deﬁned in the same
way as in Eq. (23). Following Eq. (3), the tree-level BI amplitude is
A(γ1, γ2, . . . , γn−1, γn) = A(Y1, Z2, . . . , Zn−1, Yn),
(47)
corresponding to a pair of Yµ ﬁelds interacting with the Zµ¯ν states that are longitudinally polarized
on the barred index. Concretely, the Yµ particles have the same polarization vectors eµ of the
corresponding BI photons and the Zµ¯ν particles have polarization tensors proportional to eµp¯ν.
Note that these external states are simply the tensor product of BI photon polarizations eµ with
the Y and Z¯ν external states for the NLSM in Eq. (21). Since the BI amplitude has uniform weight
w = +2, we can truncate the action by dropping all terms with weight w > +2.
The extended gravity interactions take the schematic form
L(3)
G ∼H3∂¯∂
and
L(4)
G ∼H4∂∂+ H4 ¯∂¯∂,
(48)
where we ignore all index structure except the barred or unbarred nature of the derivatives. Let us
consider the possible index structures and their weights in turn. Since the barred derivative only
lives in the ﬁrst d dimensions, we ﬁnd that
HMR∂R ∼XM¯µ∂¯µ + ZM¯µ∂¯µ.
(49)
This implies that the extended graviton ﬁeld contracting with the derivative has weight
w
h
HMR∂Ri
= 0, +2.
(50)
On the other hand, the nilpotency of XM and ZM implies that
HMRHNR ∼Xµ¯ρZν ¯ρ + Zµ¯ρXν ¯ρ + YµY ν,
(51)
which in turn ﬁxes the weight
w
h
HMRHNRi
= +2.
(52)
From Eqs. (50) and (52), we conclude that the weights for cubic and quartic order are
w
h
L(3)
G
i
≥+2
and
w
h
L(4)
G
i
≥+2.
(53)
Because extended gravity is a two-derivative theory, all higher-order interaction terms share the
same derivative structures as Eq. (48) except with more powers of the extended graviton. Since
w
h
HMRHNRi
> 0, terms at quintic order and higher have w > +2 and can thus be dropped.
15

Transverse Conditions
As before, we can exploit the transverse properties of the ﬁelds to eliminate even more terms. Up
to total derivatives, the action in Eq. (46) is equal to
L(3)

(54)
where we have deﬁned the right-index ﬁeld strength for Xµ¯ν,
Xµ¯ν ¯ρ = ∂¯νXµ¯ρ −∂¯ρXµ¯ν.
(55)
Crucially, the ﬁeld Xµ¯ν only appears in the action through its ﬁeld strength Xµ¯ν ¯ρ or in terms
proportional to ∂¯νZµ¯ν. This allows us to apply an argument similar to that in Sec. 3. In particular,
any factor of ∂¯νZµ¯ν that contributes to a Feynman diagram will ultimately be projected to zero on
an external leg or attached to an internal vertex. Since all internal vertices involving Xµ¯ν depend
only on the ﬁeld strength Xµ¯ν ¯ρ or are proportional to ∂¯νZµ¯ν, these longitudinal contributions are
always eventually zeroed out. The resulting BI action in Eq. (54) also agrees with an action-level
double copy construction combining YM theory and the NLSM [28].
Let us contrast the quartic representation of BI action in Eq. (54) with the canonical represen-
tation of BI action arising from brane-localized gauge ﬁelds,
LBI = −T
q
−det(ηµν + 2πα′Fµν),
(56)
where the determinant structure induces an inﬁnite tower of interactions. As before, all of the
dimensionful coupling constants in our new BI action are absorbed into the normalization of the
longitudinal polarizations. Similar to the NLSM, our formulation does not manifest permutation
invariance and unitarity, though these are still present in scattering amplitudes, as proved in Ref. [1].
However, thanks to its ﬁnite interactions, it is tremendously simpler to calculate amplitudes in this
action. In Ref. [29], a simpliﬁcation of the BI action was constructed using auxiliary ﬁelds and a
setup speciﬁc to certain spacetime dimensions. In contrast, our formulation is valid in arbitrary
spacetime dimension and the construction follows directly from our analogous treatment of the
NLSM; it may therefore also oﬀer some insight for the double copy structure of BI theory.
4.2
Dimensional Reduction to the Special Galileon Theory
Last but not least, we apply action-level transmutation again to BI theory to obtain an action for
the SG theory. This is equivalent to a double dimensional reduction of the extended graviton action,
16

taking the unbarred and barred indices of the extended graviton to both run over 2d+1 dimensions.
We then decompose the extended graviton ﬁeld HMM into a (2d + 1) × (2d + 1) matrix,
HMM = XMM + YMM + ZMM,
(57)
where each contribution is
XMM = 1
2

(58)
The components not shown all enter in pairs in the action so they can be consistently dropped from
the action provided we are interested in tree-level amplitudes only involving the states represented
above. These deﬁnitions again imply a nilpotency condition,
XMRX
R
N

N

N = ZRMZR
N = 0
XMRY R
N
= ZMRY R
N

N = ZRMYR
N = 0,
(59)
and likewise for structures with additional derivatives. Using the weight-counting arguments pro-
vided at the end of this section, we can expand the extended gravity action in components and
truncate, yielding the action for the SG,
LSG = L(2)
SG + L(3)
SG,
(60)
where each term is given by
L(2)
SG = Xµ¯µ□Zµ¯µ + 1
2Y □Y
L(3)
SG = −1
2Zµ¯µ∂¯µZν¯ν∂νXµ¯ν + 1
4Zµ¯µ∂µY ∂¯µY + {Y Y →Xµ¯µZµ¯µ + Zµ¯µXµ¯µ}
+ O(∂µZµ¯µ) + O(∂¯µZµ¯µ).
(61)
As we will show, all possible quartic interactions in the extended graviton action can be consistently
dropped due to the weight counting argument presented in the subsequent discussion. Moreover,
all quintic and higher-order interactions can also be dropped because the SG action is equivalent to
a transmutation of BI action, which itself originates from the extended graviton action truncated
to quartic order.
17

Weight Counting
From Eqs. (2) and (3), we see that the SG amplitude is given by
A(φ1, φ2, . . . , φn−1, φn) = A(Y1, Z2, . . . , Zn−1, Yn),
(62)
corresponding to a pair of Y states with all other external states given by Zµ¯µ particles whose
polarizations are longitudinal and thus proportional to pµp¯µ. Note that these external states are
the “square” of the Y and Zµ external states for the NLSM in Eq. (21).
Since dimensional reduction is applied to both barred and unbarred indices, it is natural to
promote the weight into a two-component vector, (w, ¯w) = (n−h, n−¯h), where h and ¯h correspond
to the pseudo-helicity for the unbarred and barred indices. For each state, we have
w[Xµ¯µ] = ¯w[Xµ¯µ] = +2,
w[Y ] = ¯w[Y ] = +1,
w[Zµ¯µ] = ¯w[Zµ¯µ] = 0.
(63)
For an amplitude on its factorization channel, A ∼ALAR, their weights are related by w[A] =
w[AL] + w[AR] −2 and ¯w[A] = ¯w[AL] + ¯w[AR] −2, so we conclude that the tree-level SG amplitude
has weight (w, ¯w) = (+2, +2). From the schematic form in Eq. (48), the unbarred indices in H4 ¯∂¯∂
have the same tensor structure as the quartic interactions in YM. As we learned in the NLSM, these
interactions have w = +4, which can be truncated, and similarly for H4∂∂. Combining with the
weight counting arguments in BI, we see that the quartic and higher interactions of the extended
graviton action dimensionally reduce to terms with either w > +2 or ¯w > +2, so they can be
consistently dropped.
Transverse Conditions
Next, let us consider the transverse properties of the ﬁelds in the SG action. Deﬁning an analogue
of the Riemann tensor as in Ref. [7],
Xµν¯µ¯ν = ∂µ∂¯µXν¯ν + ∂ν∂¯νXµ¯µ −∂µ∂¯νXν¯µ −∂ν∂¯µXµ¯ν = ∂µXν¯µ¯ν −∂νXµ¯µ¯ν,
(64)
our ﬁnal form for the SG action becomes
LSG = Xµ¯µ□Zµ¯µ + 1
2Y □Y −1
4

Xµν¯µ¯νZµ¯µZν¯ν + Zµ¯νY ∂µ∂¯νY

+ O(∂µZµ¯µ) + O(∂¯µZµ¯µ),
(65)
modulo total derivatives. Up to terms of the form O(∂µZµ¯µ) and O(∂¯µZµ¯µ), the ﬁeld Xµ¯µ appears
in the action only in the form of Xµν¯µ¯ν. By an argument exactly analogous to the one given in
Sec. 4.1, these terms proportional to O(∂µZµ¯µ) and O(∂¯µZµ¯µ) can be dropped. As was shown in
Ref. [7], Eq. (65) can also be obtained from Eq. (25) via the action-level double copy.
The cubic SG action in Eq. (65) is substantially simpler than the canonical formulation of the
SG action, which describes a scalar invariant under an extended shift symmetry [30],
φ →φ + a + bµ + cµνxµxν + cµν∂µφ∂νφ/Λ6,
(66)
18

where a, bµ, and cµν are a constant scalar, vector, and traceless symmetric tensor, respectively. In
four dimensions, the canonical form of the SG action is
LSG = −1
2∂µφ∂µφ +
1
12Λ6∂µφ∂µφ (□φ□φ −∂ρ∂σφ∂ρ∂σφ) ,
(67)
while in d dimensions there is a tower of even-point interactions at all valences less than or equal
to d + 1. In contrast, the SG action in Eq. (65) is purely cubic for general dimension.
4.3
Origin of the Double Copy
By inspection, the SG action in Eq. (65) is obtained by squaring all of the terms in the NLSM
action in Eq. (26). This is an action-level manifestation of the double copy [7]. Our prescription for
dimensional reduction actually trivializes the origin of the double copy structure, by the following
argument. Our discussion of weight counting reveals that pion scattering is encoded within the
cubic sector of YM theory.
However, the purely cubic topologies of YM theory automatically
satisfy kinematic Jacobi identities up to contact terms coming from the quartic vertices.
This
is because one can always probe a maximal factorization channel on which every propagator is
on shell.
In this limit, the only contributions to amplitudes are the cubic diagrams, so these
contributions necessarily satisfy the kinematic Jacobi identities up to terms involving contact terms.
However, since all quartic terms are eliminated by the choice of external states corresponding to
pion scattering, the mismatch from the kinematic Jacobi identities is eliminated and the resulting
cubic action automatically satisﬁes them. We thus conclude that since the cubic sector of YM
double copies into the cubic sector of gravity and these coincide with the NLSM and the SG, the
actions that result from our dimensional reduction automatically manifest the double copy.
5
Conclusions
In this paper, we have proposed a variation of dimensional reduction that excises the NLSM from
YM theory as well as BI theory and the SG theory from the extended graviton action. This operation
is essentially an action-level incarnation of the transmutation operation on scattering amplitudes
derived in Ref. [1]. These relations reveal the origin of the kinematic algebra of the NLSM as the
higher-dimensional Poincaré invariance of an underlying YM theory. Remarkably, the NLSM and
SG arise from purely cubic interactions in YM and gravity, while BI arises from only the cubic and
quartic interactions of gravity. Since the cubic sector of YM theory automatically double copies
into gravity, the same is trivially true for the NLSM to the SG. Note that the theories obtained
here—the NLSM, BI theory, and the SG theory—precisely coincide with the exceptional theories
studied in Ref. [31] argued to be the natural eﬀective ﬁeld theory analogues of YM theory and
gravity.
19

Our results suggest a number of directions for future work. One avenue is to derive action-level
versions of the other transmutation operations presented in Ref. [1]. For instance, one expects
an action-level operation that sends gravity to YM theory. While this is naturally accomplished
by Kaluza-Klein reduction, the simplicity of the S-matrix mapping suggests that something more
minimal is possible. Such a realization may teach us new structures of YM theory, such as color-
kinematics duality.
Another direction deserving of further study is higher loop order in perturbation theory. Since
Ref. [1] derived unifying relations for tree-level scattering amplitudes, the procedure for dimensional
reduction derived here is only guaranteed to reproduce amplitudes at tree level. As is also the case for
the double copy construction, matching at higher loop order will likely involve additional structure.
It would also be interesting to study the loop-level amplitudes computed from the actions presented
here and to compare them with known results in the NLSM, BI theory, and the SG theory.
Last but not least, pions are famously known to be related to gluons through the Goldstone
boson equivalence theorem. Although the (2d+1)-dimensional transmutation is proven in Ref. [1] by
modern S-matrix techniques, it would be illuminating to show the connection to the Goldstone boson
equivalence theorem. Such a relation would also oﬀer new insights into the nature of transmutation.
