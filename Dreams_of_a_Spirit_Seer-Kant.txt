TRANSLATOR'S
NOTE.
The
difficulties which
Kant's
style
presents
to
the
translator
into
English need
not be
dwelt upon
with
those
who
are
familiar
with
his
works.
My
main
endeavour has been
to produce a readable
translation.
I
have,
therefore,
laid
stress on
the
faithful and
lucid
representation
of
the
author's
thought,
while
the
preservation of the periodic constructions of the original
was
of
secondary
interest.
I
am,
however,
conscious
that
I
have not
in
all
places succeeded
in
sailing with
even
keel
between
the
extremes
of
strictly
literal
translation and
paraphrase.

THE
EDITOR'S
PREFACE.
Kant's " Dreams of a Spirit-Seer,* illustrated by those
of Metaphysics," was published
in
the year
1766.
His
mental attitude at the time has been
well described by
his latest biographer and
critic, M. Kronenberg
: Kant
;
Sein Leben, and
Seine
Lehre
:
Munchen
:
Beck:
1897.
8vo. VII., 312.
The writer says in regard to the alleged
scepticism of Kant about
the year
1764:
"All around
the metaphysicians were
still directing their telescopes to
the farthest ends of the universe
:
Kant, on the contrary,
having
long
returned
from
this
high-strung
flight, was
making himself comfortably at home on earth."
(p.
157.)
Of the " Dreams of a Spirit-Seer " he says
:
'* Between the visions of Swedenborg and those of the
metaphysicians
of
his
time,
Kant
drew
a
surprising
parallel.
Swedenborg believed himself to be as familiarly
acquainted with the beyond as with his own house.
Was
• The common title, " Dreams of a Ghost-Seer,"
is not
retained
bec.iuse
it
is a manifestly false rendering of the term " Geisterseher."
This means simply a seer of "spirits," not
of "ghosts."
Had
the
latter
been
Kant's
intention
he
would
have
used
the
word
"Gespcnst," ghost, and not "Geist," spirit.— F.S.

PREFACE.
not
the
case
the same
with
the
philosophers?
Kant
believed
himself
to
be
in
a
position
to
explain
these
delusions, the one by the other, and so to get rid of both.
"So entirely did Kant look down upon Swedenborg and
his
contemporaries
the
metaphysicians
that he merely
played with them, handling them now with serious irony,
now with
sly humour, sometimes pouring upon them
his
gallish scorn and dealing them the sharpest blows
of his
cynical wit.
Such a tone
is only assumed by one who
sees
his
subject
far beneath
him.
So
did Kant
hold
himself
in
regard
to
the
metaphysicians,
to
general
philosophical knowledge, yea even to knowledge itself as
a whole."
(pp.
i6i,
163).
This judgment may be compared with Kuno
Fischer:
Geschichte der ?ieu. Phil., Bd.
III., p. 232
: 2nd Ed., 1869,
for remarkable agreements.*
That the " Dreams of a
Spirit-Seer " was a humorous
critique aimed
chiefly
at
the
philosophers
of his
day,
using Swedenborg as a convenient because non-combative
and comparatively unknown mark
for
his
blows,
is now
generally
conceded.
But
the
century and
a
half that
have elapsed since
that time have brought Swedenborg
out of his
obscurity
into
light, and
his
real
relation to
Kant and the latter's
great indebtedness
to him
is now
* " Swedenborg and Metaphysics were, to use a familiar phrase,
for Kant 'two flies to be killed
at
one
slap.'
He went laughingly
at
it.
The comparison was itself a witty one, and
the philosophers
took
it up good-naturedly, and with
all indulgence followed
it out
to
its
respective
conclusions."

find
in

a

the

little
forseeing
that
in
four
years'
time,
for
his
inaugural
dissertation
of
1770,
he
would
be
choosing no
other theme than
that
of the same vision
he had thus destroyed—that namely of a mtindus

et

that
all
through
his
subsequent teaching and writing, including
the
Critique
and
the
Religion

Gr., he would be finding the basis
of his
positive
idealism only
in
those
principles of the
Arcana he had once
affected
to
despise.
Will not this
circumstance account
for the
instruction given by Kant
to
his
editor
Tieftrunk
(see
Kant's

Hartenstein

"I
assent
with pleasure
to
your
proposal

minor
writings.

not

earlier than

Thus omitting the " Dreams."
In view of these investigations
the
importance
of the
Traiime
as
a
potent
factor
in
Kant's development
is
the nature of a soirit, which
is
all
too
hypothetical, but from some
actual and
universally conceded observation.
Presuming upon the
reader's indulgence,
I insert an attempt
of the
kind, somewhat out
of my way, to
be
sure, and
far from
a
demonstration, but never-
theless giving occasion,
it seems to me, for not unpleasant surmises."

SO manifest as to make a longer
delay
in
its
translation
into English inexcusable.
At
the same
time
the
growing
appreciation among
students
of
the
profound
philosophic
principles
which
underlie the teachings of Swedenborg make the occasion
of
this
publication
an
opportune one
for
placing
side
by
side
with
the
leading
affirmations
made
by
Kant
in the Dissertation and his University Lectures, a citation
of those
passages
in
Swedenborg by
v.hich
they
were
evidently
suggested
or
with
which
they
stand
in
interesting relation.
In this way the " Seer," however
it may fare with the
" Metaphysicians "
in
Kant's
hands,
will
at
least
be
allowed to speak
for
himself, and
the
reader may form
his judgments at
first hand.
To
the student of modern
philosophical
development
it
will
not
be
time
lost
to
witness here, where
it has been
least suspected, the first
decided
and
controlling
influence
of
Swedenborg's
spiritual philosophy upon modern idealistic thought.
To aid the reader in arriving at a truer understanding
and appreciation of these " Dreams " and of their import
in
Kant's
entire system
I
have
translated and brought
together
the
recent
utterances
of
German and
other
philosophers
on
the
subject
of
Swedenborg's
real
influence upon
Kant, as shown
especially in the
latter's
Lectures on Psychology and
Lectures on Metaphysics.

PROFESSOR VAIHINGER ON
KANT'S
DOCTRINE
OF THE TWO WORLDS AND
TTS RELATION TO SWEDENBORG.
In
his
Commentary
on
" Kant's
Transcendental
Esthetic, Lecture
i. on Space,"*
where the problem
is
under discussion whether space be
(i.) purely Objective
and a />os/eriort (Newton), or
(ii.)
purely subjective and
a priori
(Kant),
or
(iii.)
according
to Treudclenburg's
"'i'hird
Possibility,"
at
once Objective and
Subjective
(Leibnitz),
Professor
Vaihinger
introduces
a
note
on
Lambert's
suggestion.
"Our space
is
a simulacrum
of
true
space"
(Lambert's
Recension,
1773,
on

quotes
Lambert's
letter
to

DREAMS OF A SPIIUT-SEER.
" I thought that the simulacrum (appearance) of Time
and Space in the Thought World could easily be brought
into
contemplation
with
your
sublime
theory."
Also
Mendelssohn
in
his
letter
to
Kant,
Dec.
23,
1770,
regarding time says
:
"Time
is, according
to
Leibnitz, a phenomenon, and
has, like all phenomena, something objective and something
subjectivey
Kant has, moreover, touched upon the problem
in the
Dissertation
(/>., the Inaugural Dissertation on the Two
Worlds
:
1770).
He asks outright in § 16
:
quotia7n pricipio ipsa haec relaiio omnium substantiarum
nitatur, quae intuitive spectato vocatur spatium
?
To what seems to us spatium there corresponds then an
ipsa
substantiarum
relatio.
He
answers
this
subtilis
quaestio thus
:
that the connection of all appearances
in
space is a reflection (Gegenbild) of the connection of all
substances in the primal Being, " ideoque spatium, quod est
conditio
universalis
et necessaria compraescntiae onuiium
sensitive
cogfiita,
did
potest
omnipraesentia
(sic) phe-
7iomenon
( Sfho/ioji 22)."
"Therefore Space, which
is
the
universal
and
necessary
condition
of
the
united
presence of all things, sensitively known, may be
called
omnipresence as phenomenon, or the phenomenal omni-
presence
.
.
.
. '*
Still
Kant
is
unwilling
to enter
* Kant's Dissertation was produced
in
1770.
It was about the
year 1769 that Swedenborg wrote in Canones Novae
Ecclesiae the
doctrine that space and time are not forms of things in themselves,
but
by
correspondence
there
is
such
relationship
(between

farther upon such mystic surmises (indagaiionas mysticas),
which, he
says,
suggest
Malebranche,
but which
more
truly
recall
Swedenborg,
and he
very
distinctly
asserts
further on
(§ 27)
that
"it
is impossible
for the human
intellect
to know
in
substantiis
immafcrialil'us
these
rehUiones
exiernas
which
correspond
to
Space
as
the
condition of the
relation
of material
but only apparent
(erscheinende)
things.
Kant
therefore
recognizes
rela-
tions
of
the
things
in
themselves which correspond
to
Space, but regards them as unknowable.
On
the other
hand, Ivanibert's suggestions hold good
still and
with
all
the more
force
:
That
to reason by analogy—at
least
to a certain extent—from the spatial relations of appear-
ances to the true relations of things
in themselves
is not
phenomena
and
noumena).
Thus:
"God's
infinity
as
corres-
ponding
to
spaces
is
called
' imniensily
'
;
and
as
corresponding
to times
' eternity
'
;
yet there
is nothing of space in his immensity,
and n(jlhing of time in his e'.ernity. "
.See also Swedenborg's state-
ment in Divine Lore and Wisdom, 69-73
• " ^'^ Divine apart from
space
fills all the spaces of the universe
The Divine is
in
all
time,
apart
from
time."
On
.Space and Time as forms
of
human
thinking,
or of
the universe as
" sensitively known,"
see
Swedcnl>org, Arcana CoUsfia, 7381 (published 1753).
"The ideas
of
interior
thought
pertaining
to man,
although
they
are above
material
things,
yet
terminate
in
natural
things, and where
they
terminate they apf)ear
to
be.
Thence the man
jierceives what he
thinks.
If the idea from time and space were taken away he would
not know what
lie thinks.
.
.
.
Man cannot
in anywise think
without the idea of time and space.
The idea adheres to everything
which man
thinks.
If the idea from time and space were taken
awny
he would
not know
what
he
thinks— scarcely
whether
he
thinks.
The ideas of space arise from measuring by times
;
where-
fore where the one
is there
is the other."

DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
only
allowable
but
required."*
(Vaihinger
:
Kant
Commentar
:
ii., p.
143.)
* The Doctrine of the Reason as taught by Swedenborg and
its
bearing on our knowledge of
reality may
in general be seen from
the following extracts from the " Arcana," and other works
:
"Three
things
constitute
the
external man:
the
rational,
the
scientific, and the external sensuous.
The rational
is interior, and
is
that
through
which
the
interior
man
is
conjoined
with
the
external
;
in
itself
it
is nothing
unless affection
flows
into
it and
makes
it
active
;
and
it
thence becomes such as
is
the
affection.
When
the
affection
of good
inflows,
this becomes
in the
rational
the
affection
of
truth
;
the
contrary when
the
affection
of
evil
inflows."
(Swedenborg's Arcana Ccelestia, 15S9.)
"What goes on
in the internal man cannot be apprehended by
the man himself because
it
is above
the
rational
from which he
thinks.
To
the
inmost
or
internal man
is
subject
the
rational
faculty or principle which appears as
if belonging
to man.
Into
this
there inflow through
the
internal man
the
celestial
things of
love and of faith
; and through this rational down into the scientific
things which belong
to
the external man.
But
the
things which
flow in are received according to the state of each."
(Ibid., 1941.)
" Man
is born into nothing rational, but only into the faculty of
receiving
it, and as he learns and imbues
all things so he becomes
rational.
This
is done by
the way
of the body.
But
there
is
something constantly flowing
in from the interior which receives the
things thus entering [through the bodily senses] and disposes them
into order.
Hence
is their order ami the relationships among them,
from which
it
is evident
that
the
rational
faculty of man
is from
divine celestial good as its father."
{Ibid., 2557.)
"The things of reason
illustrated by the divine are appearances
of truth.
All appearances [phenomena]
of truth
in which
is
the
divine are of the rational faculty, insomuch that rational truths and
appearances of truth are the same, whereas
scientific
things belong
to the natural plane.
Rational truths can never be and come forth
except from an
inflowing of the divine
into the
rational faculty of
^
man
;
and
through
the
things of reason
into the
scientific
things
which belong to the natural plane of the tnind.
The things that then

INTRODUCTION.
7
take place in the rational appear in the natural
plane as an image of
many things together in a mirror."
(IluJ., 3368.)
" Rational
things,
or what
is
the same,
appearances of
truth,
that
is, spiritual truths, are not knowledges [acquired hy the senses,
F.
S.], hut are in knowledges
;
for they are of the rational or internal
man.
For knowledges
l>eing of the natural man
are vessels which
receive rational things."
(/did., 3391.)
" When man
is
in
the world
his
rational
is
distinct from
his
natural
[plane of thought]
;
insomuch
that
he can be withdrawn
irom
external
sensuous
things and
in some
degree
from
interior
sensuous things and be
in
his rational,
thus
in
spiritual
thought.''
{/*/./., 349S.)
"It
is not he who can ratiocinate from scientific facts who enjoys
the rational
faculty.
A fatuous lumen produces
this
skill.
But he
enjoys the rational who can see clearly
tliat good
is good and
truth
truth
; consequently
that
evil
is
evil and
falsity
falsity.
Thus the
scientific [sensuous] knowledges are means for perfecting the rational
faculty and
also
for destroying
it
;
and
those who by means
of
scientific knowledges have destroyed their
rational faculty arc more
stupid than those versed in no knowledges."
{Ibid., 4156.)
"The
faculty of thinking
rationally regarded
in
itself,
is
not of
man, but of God with him.
Upon
this depends human reason
in
general."
(Divine Love and Wisdom, 23.)

ON THE RELATION
OF MAN TO OTHER
THINKING
BEINGS.
From
Professor Vaihinger's Kant Commentar.
Vol.
II.
"Kant delights in the assertion that we are imprisoned
by the senses,
i.e., by the Hmitations of sensuous appear-
ances
.
.
.
'The highest Being will surely not be subject to
all
these appearances which sense unavoidably imposes
on those intelligences derived by us through experience.'
(A. 640).
'All Nature exists only for us
.
.
.'
This Kant
formulates expressly as the result of the /Esthetic in the
Prolegomena, § 36
: 'How
is nature
possible in material
relation, that
is, viewed
as the concept of appearances ?
how are Space, Time, and what
fill
these
as
objects of
sensation
possible ?
The answer

INTRODUCTION.

The
above
reference
of
Kant
to
"other
thinking
beings"
is not,
as has
been
so
generally
supposed,
a
mere critical suggestion, but is made in thorough earnest.
The
existence and
nature
of the
"Spirit World"
was
from
the
beginning
an
interesting problem with
Kant.
In the Natural History of the Heavens^ R. VI., 179, and
especially 206, " On
the Inhabitants of the
Stars," Kant
sets
forth
his
theories
about
the
" various
classes
of
intelligent
beings," the " kinds of thinking natures," and
" In the spiritual world
the progressions of
life appear
to be
in
time
;
but since state there determines time, time is only an appear-
ance.
Time in the spiritual world is nothing but the quality of state.
Times ate not
there
constant
as
in
the
natural world, but change
according
to
the
state of
life, having relation especially to changes
of wisdom.
Time there
is one with thought from aft'ection.
(70-74.)
" But
time and space as fixed or measured by material standards
are proper
to nature, and
as such
belong only
to a
limited world,
and cannot be applied to infinite being.
Time and space belong
to
nature,
just
as
finiteness
or
limitation
belong
to a created world.
For
nothing which
is
proper
to nature can
be predicated of the
Divine, and space and time are proper
to nature.
Space in nature
is
measurable, and
so
is
lime.
Nature
derives
this measurement
from
the apparent
revolution and annual
motion
of the sun of
this
world.
But in the spiritual world
it
is ilifferent.
(73.)
" Times which
are
proper
to
nature
in
its
world
are
in
the
spiritual world
pure
states which appear progressive, because atigcls
and spirits arc finite ; from which
it may be seen
that
in God they
arc not
progressive, because He
is
Infinite, and
infinite
things
in
Him are One
; and hence
it
follows that
the
Divine
in
all
lime
is
a|>art from time.
(75-)
Schopenhauer in his essay, " Versuch uebcr Geislcrseher and was
damit
lusammenhaengt,"
in
the
volume
entitled
" Parerga
and
Paralipomcna," Vol.
I.,
pp. 241, 328, calls attention
to an existing
order of things

on
the
various
" dwelling-places "
of these
" intelligent
creatures."
He speaks at length about the dependence
of the " spiritual
faculties " of the various Planet-inhabit-
ants on the grosser or
finer, heavier or lighter, matter as
determined by the "distance
of these abodes from the
sun ..."
The inhabitants of Jupiter or Saturn belong
to
the
" most
exalted
class
of
intelligent
creatures.
These
at
least have
a
different Time-idea from
ours
they are not subject to death in the same degree that we
are ..."
Man occupies a middle ground between these
most
excellent
and
the
more
imperfect
grades
of
laws of nature do not
apply, hence where time and
space do not
separate individuals any more, and where separation and
isolation
resulting from time and space do not
offer obstacles to influence of
will or to communication of thought.

Here, be
it said, that
the true idea of actio in distans is that the space between the worker
and the worked upon, whether full
or empty, has no influence at all
on the working
;
it
is the same whether the distance be an inch or a
billion of Uranus orbits.
'
(p. 282.)
We commonly imagine
that
the
reality of a
spiritual world
is
overthrown when we have shown
that such a world
is only subject-
ively conditioned.
But what weight can
that argument have with
one who
knows
from
Kant's
doctrine
how
strong
a
share
of
subjective conditions is involved in the appearance
[to our senses] of
the corporeal world
; how for instance
this world with the space
in
which
it
stands,
the time
in which
it moves, and
the causality in
which
the being of matter
consists,
according
to
its whole form
therefore,
is
only a
form
of
brain-functioning,
according
as
the
impressions
are awakened by
shock on
the
nerves
of
the sense
organ."
(p. 318.)
And this shock, which
it
is the main purpose of Schopenhauer in
this essay to prove, may
really occur from
internal as from external
causes.
And
therefore,
as he
says,
" there remains
left only the
question as to the Ding an sick."

"thinking
natures." *
These
thoughts,
to
which
by
Kant "probability"
is frankly attributed, are carried out
at length
in
the " Dreams of a
Spirit-seer, &c.,"
in
the
half serious, half
ironical
style which
characterises
this
remarkable work.
(Du
Prel makes another application
of this thought
:
T/ie Planet-dwellers ; 1880, pp.
1 14-175.)
See Fortschr. d. Met. Ros.
I., 497
:
" We could imagine
an immediate
representation
of an
object, not
through
the conditions of sense, but by the understanding.
But
we have no tangible idea of such knowledge.
Still,
it
is
necessary for us to think of such
in order not to subject
all
beings
capable
in
intelligence
to
only
our way
of
seeing
things.
For
it may
be
that some world-beings
might behold
the same objects under another form.
It
can also be that
this form
is, and
of necessity must
be,
the same
in all
world-beings, although we do not under-
stand this necessity."
Kant refers to this last possibility
also later
in
his Note
II. to the second
edition
of the
yKsthetic, but remarks that

This work appeired in

in London in 1758.

not change
its
subjectivity.
Kant
declares very distinctly in the Grundl.
z. Met. d.

VIII.,
84:
"that the world
of sense may be very different according to the difference
of sense perception in various world beholders, while the
world
of
understanding
which
lies
at
its
foundation
remains always the same."
Kant has
therefore adhered
in all earnest, even in
his " critical " period, to
this
idea
conceived
at an
earlier
time.—Vaihinger
: Kant Com-
mentar

In a chapter devoted to a discussion of the
Origin of
Kanfs
Doctrine of Space
and
Time,
especially
as
to
whether Kant's attitude in the year
1770
as
represented
by the Dissertation on
the Two Worlds was wholly
the
result of his own thinking
or caused
partly by Leibnitz'
Nouveaux
Essais,
with
its
clearly
marked
distinction
between the mitndus sensibilis and the mundiis
intelligi-
bilis,
as
well
as
by
other
external
influences,
Prof.
Vaihinger, in a footnote remarks as follows
:

to
the influence of Euler, whose
'Letters to a German
Princess,' 1769, Kant
quotes very
favourably
in

The
same
author, in Anschluss an Diihring, Krit. Gesch. d. Phil., 396,
finds
in
Kant's

influences,
a view
at
first
surprising
but
not
to
be

too
abruptly.

applied
precisely the same terms to both worlds which Kant has

He says the spiritual

;
this

the connection
of Kant
with
Swedenborg,
still we are not
to
fall
into
the
other
error
of denying
altogether
a
positive
relation
of Kant
to Swedenborg
which shows itself occasionally even in the period of the
' Critique,'
as
for
example

Reason

: A. 808
:

Kant Commentar II.,
p. 431.
Finally,
in
a
chapter
of
General
Observations,
the
author
compares
Kant's
itifiiitus
originarius
with
Swedenborg's
" pneumatische Anschauung "
or
" Soul-
vision "
:
"As
B. Erdmann
(Reflex
II.,
313)
rightly
remarks,
attitude of Kant
is here no longer
perceptible."
(Du Prel—Intro-
duction to Kant's " Lectures on Psychology," pp.
vii.,
viii.)
"The
faculty
ascribed
to
Swedenborg
answers
completely
to
Kant's conception
of a being
inhabiting two worlds
at
the same
time."
(Du Prel,
Ibid., p. xxiv.)
That Kant
at
the time of the
letter
to Fraeulein von Knobloch
felt the deepest interest in Swedenborg
is freely admitted by Robert
Hoar in his Inaugural Discussion, entitled Der Angebliche Mysticis-
mits Kanfs.
Brugg
:
1895.
"So soon
as Swedenborg's 'Arcana
Coelestia' was
printed, for
whose
publication
he
had
been
eagerly
waiting,
he
bought
the
volumes
at seven pounds
sterling, and
this
at
a time when Kant,
the piivat-docent, was anything but well
off, and when that amount
of money meant more
than
it does now.
That
he
also studied
other works of Swedenborg besides
the
'Arcana,' appears from a
letter
of Hamann
to Scheffner, Nov.
10, 1784, where he mentions
Swedenborg and Kant
:
'As our Kant
at
that time
prescribed
to
himself all the works of the Dreamer, so I had the patience to wade
through the whole set of thick Quartos."

INTRODUCTION.

the acceptance of
this
' soul-vision
' stands
in
manifest
connection
with
the
' philosophic
invention
'
of
a
viundus
infel/igidilis
with
its
' spiritual
'
constitution.
The spiritual world
is visible only
to the
spiritual
sight.
Man does not
possess
this
; only God
does.
But
that
man may come to possess this vision which
is
for a time
denied him,
Kant does not
deny.
Indeed,
the immor
lality
of man
consists
in
just
this
possession,
in
the
change from the sensuous spatial vision into the timeless
and
spaceless
spiritual
vision
:
and
this
is
itself
* the
other world.'
The other world
is therefore not another
place, but only another view of even
this
world.*
This
hypothesis appears in the
' Dreams ;' also
in the period
between
1770
and
17S0
in
the
'Lectures
on
Meta-
physics,'
p.
225
;
and
even
in
the
Critique
of Pure
Reason, A. 393
;
especially in the Meihoden/ehrc, A. 779,
where Kant admits of our accepting such a
' transcen-
dental
hypothesis,"
yea, approves of
it.
He
proposes,
indeed,
in
the
same
line
of
thought,
the
following
hypothesis
:
' That
this
life
is
nothing more
than
the
mere
appearance,
i.e.,
the
sensuous
semblance
of
the
pure
spiritual
life, and
the whole sense world
is but a
picture
which
hovers
before
our
present
modes
of
knowing, anrl, like a dream, has no reality
in
itself; and
that,
if we should know and
see things and ourselves as
they
really
are, we should
see ourselves
in
a world of
spiritual
natures.'
That
' world
of
spiritual
natures
constitutes then that timeless
' corf^us mysticum of rational
beings
' (A. 808, B. 836).
Of this corpus mysticum Kant

i6

has already spoken in the
' Dreams,' where he mentions
the
' spiritual body
' and
the
' society of
spirits
'
(Ros.
VII.,
A.
96).*
These
expressions
of Kant
offered
at
* On the change from the natural to the spiritual world Sweden-
borg says
:
"MAN AFTER DEATH
IS
IN ALL SENSE, MEMORY,
THOUGHT, AND AFFECTION, IN WHICH HE WAS
IN THE WORLD, AND LEAVES NOTHING EXCEPT
HIS EARTHLY BODY.
"That man when he
passes out
of the
natural world into the
spiritual, as
is
the case when he
dies,
carries with him
all
things
that
are
his, or which belong to him
as a man, except
his earthly
body, has been
testified
to me by manifold
experience
;
for man
when
he enters
the
spiritual
world, or
the
life
after death,
is
in
a body as
in
the world
;
to appearance there is no
difiference, since
he does not perceive nor see any difference.
But
his body
is
then
spiritual, and
thus separated
or
purified from
earthly
things, and
when what is spiritual touches and sees what
is spiritual,
it is just as
when what
is
natural
touches and
sees what
is
natural
: hence
a
man, when he has become a spirit, does not know
otherwise than
tliat he
is in his body in which he was
in
the world, and thus does
not know
that
he
has deceased.
A man-spirit
also enjoys every
external and internal sense which he enjoyed in the world
; he
sees
as
before, he hears and speaks as before, he
also smells and tastes,
and when he is touched, he feels the touch as before
; he also longs,
desires, craves, thinks,
reflects,
is
affected,
loves,
wills, as
before
;
and he who is delighted with
studies, reads and writes
as
before.
In a word, when
a man passes from one life into the other, or from
one world
into the
other,
it
is as
if he passed from one place into
another
; and he carries with him
all
things which he possessed in
himself as a man, so that
it cannot be said that the man after death,
which
is only the death
of the earthly body, has
lost anything of
himself
He
also
carries with him
the
natural memory,
for he
retains all things whatsoever which he has in the world heard, seen,
read, learned, and thought, from
earliest infancy even to the end of
life
;
the
natural
objects,
however,
which
are

once a welcome meeting ground
to
the
' mystics,' from
Jung-Stilling down
to Du
Prel.
Schopenhauer has also
turned
Kant's transcendental idealism to the support of
mysticism
as
occasion
has
offered
;
but
especially was
Jung-Stilling an
admirer
of
the
i4i!sthetic,
because
he
traced
through
its
involved
argumentation
the
direct
influence of Swedenborg.
The
latter's ideas Kant
calls
"very
sublime."
(Metaphysik,
Ed.
Poelitz,
p.
257;
compare Du
Prel, Kant's Vorlesungeniiber Psychologic,
1889
; comp. Riehl, Krit.
I., 229).
" Swedenborg says
: The Spiritual
\\'orld
is a very real
quiescent, as
is
the case with
a man when he does not think from
them
; hut still they are reproduced when
it pleases the Lord.
That
s\ich
is the
state of man
after death, the
sensual man cannot
at
all
believe, because he does
not comprehend
it
;
for
the
sensual man
cannot think otherwise than
naturally, even about
spiritual
things.
" But
still
the difference between the life of man in the spiritual
world and his life in the natural world,
is great, as well with respect
to
the
external
senses and
their
affections, as with
respect
to
the
internal
senses and
their
affections.
Those who
are
in
heaven
perceive by
the
senses,
that
is,
they
see and
hear, much
more
exquisitely, and also think more wisely, than when they were in the
world
;
for
they see
from
the
light
of heaven,
which
exceeds by
many degrees
the
light of the world
; and
they hear by a
spiritual
atmosphere, which
likewise by many degrees
surpasses
that of the
earth.
The
difference of these
external
senses
is as the difference
between sunshine and
the obscurity of a
mist, in the world, and as
the
difference
between
the
light
at
mid-day and
the
shade
at
evening
;
for the
light of heaven, because
it
is
divine truth,
gives
to
the
sight of the
angels
to perceive and
distinguish
things the
most minute.
Their
external sight also corresponds to the internal
sight, or to the understanding
;
for with angels one
sight flows into
the other, so that they act
as one
; hence they have so great acute-
ness,"—From

universe.
It
is
the mundus
intelligibilis which must be
distinguished from this tnundo sensibili.
He says that all
spiritual
natures
are
connected
with
one
another,
&c.
Even
now
our
souls
stand
in
this
connection
and
society and,
indeed,
in
this very world where we
are
\
only we do not here see
this
association,
because here
we enjoy only
the
sensuous
vision.
But
although we
cannot
see
it, we
are nevertheless now
in
this spiritual
society.
If this hindrance
to our
spiritual
vision were
once removed, we should
see
ourselves
in
the midst of
this spiritual society, and this is the
' other world,' which
is not a world
of other
things,
but
of the same things
seen differently by us."
"Whether
these words date from
1788 or from 1774
(Erdmann,
Phil. Mon. XIX., 129, properly chooses the
latter), they admit perhaps
of the conclusion that Kant
found
himself
in
sympathy
with
Swedenborg
in
this
contrast
between
the
sensuous
and
the
intelligible
worlds, so that the Dissertation of 1770, and with this the
Esthetic,
do
stand,
in
however
loose,
still,
a
very
positive
relation
to
the Dreams
of
1766, and so
with
Swedenborg
himself.
But the wildly fermenting must of
the
Swedenborgian
Mysticism
becomes
with
Kant
clarified
and
settled
into
the
noble,
mild,
and
yet
strong wine of criticism."

Prof. Vaihinger adds this footnote
:
" Notwithstanding,

Swedenborgian conceptions had, to some degree, entered
into his position of 1770, which we have admitted to be
entirely possible,
still, even
in
1770 Kant had declined
to
enter
further upon
such
indagationes
mysticas.
As
completely as Kant from the middle of the year 1770 set
himself to the working out of the germs of his
Criticism,
i.e,
his
critical
doctrine
of
experience,
as
this
is
developed
in
the
Analytic,
just
so
completely
must
henceforth
all
serious
contemplation
of Swedenborg's
phantasies be given
up.
That he
had,
for a
time,
lent
an
ear
to
these
phantasies
served
henceforth
as
a
warning against any attacks from Swedenborg's delusion.
If
he
speaks
in
the
Critique
of Pure
Reason of the
corpus
mysticum,
still
this
is
not
mysticism,
for
the
grossly
dogmatic
teaching
of
Swedenborg
becomes
changed
in Kant
to merely
" a bare but
still
practical
idea."
If
a
somewhat
drastic
comparison
may
be
allowed,
one
might

:
as
little
as
the

so

OBSERVATIONS BY THE PRESENT EDITOR.
With
these
sober
and
rational
conclusions
of
Pro-
fessor
Vaihinger
regarding
Kant's
relation
to
existing
"mysticism,"
meaning,
as
he
doubtless
does, modern
" spiritism,"
every
one
will
concur,
and
none
more
readily and
heartily than the followers and admirers of
Swedenborg.*
He
more
impressively
and
more
effectually
than any subsequent
writer
has warned
his
readers against the delusions and snares of the so-called
modern "medium" and the mis-named "spiritual" seance.
We would only call attention here to the misapprehension
to
which
the
concluding
note
of
Professor
Vaihinger
might give
rise, namely,
that, because Kant rejects the
absurdities
of
modern
spiritism,
therefore
we
are
to
cancel from
his system
all influences from Swedenborg's
teaching.
As matter of fact, a student equally conversant
with both
systems—those
of Kant and
Swedenborg
would
see
in the reserve of Kant over against Sweden-
borg's
" revelations
from
things
seen and
heard "
the
only attitude possible
to a
critical student of the powers
of pure
reason
to
evolve knowledge
a priori or from
itself.
The great mission of Kant was
to establish just

this
negative or
neutral
ability of
the
reason.
It can
neither create a knowledge of the spiritual world, nor can
it deny the
possibility of such a world.
It can
affirm
indeed
the
rationality
of
such
a
conception,
but
the
reality
of
it does not come
within
its domain
as pure
reason.
It
is
interesting
to
note
all
through
Kant's
"critical"
period
this
forced
attitude
of
neutrality
as
long as the inquiry
is simply and solely as to the power
of the reason
as such
to
create a knowledge of things
transcending
experience.
He
is
strictly and
manfully
consistent
with
himself
in
rejecting
as
conclusions
of
pure
reason
any
experiences
of
an
objective
world
experimentally observed, whether on
this material plane
of
existence
or
any
other.
To
refuse
to
deny
the
possibility of other planes of existence and other modes
of knowing than we now experience,
is as
far as he will
go.
As
for
admitting
the
direct
communication
of
" spirits,"
or
of
the
seer
himself whose system
of the
two worlds he has so
carefully
studied,
as elements
of
purely rational knowledge,
this was of course out of the
(}ueslion.
The
nearest approach
to the break down of
the
barrier between
Kant's
" pure reason " and Sweden-
borg's knowledge ex
visis et auditis in mundo spirituali^
is
in
the
.-Eslhetic
with
its
doctrine
of
the
subjective
origin of Time and Space.
Here of course Kant throws
down all his defences against whatever charge of idealism
or
spiritualism.
The
(juestion
is
no
longer,
can
an
" intelligible
world "
exist ?
or,
are
there
existences
other than
that of which we become aware through the

22
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
senses
of this body?
Since
the
spatial
extent and the
endurance,
or
what
we would
call
the
"reality,"
of
even
this sensuous world
is
seen,
in the Esthetic, not
to exist in the world itself but in something more real, of
which we are
in some secondary sense subjectively the
agents—the
real
question
remaining
is,
granting
that
many such worlds may exist and with them the various
modes
of
cognition,
what
connection
of
these
worlds
and
their mutual
relation
or
their
internal
order
shall
we
regard
as
consistent
with
the
demands
of
pure
reason ?
And
here
it
is
that
Kant's
recognition
of
Swedenborg's
system
of
the
two
worlds
and
their correspondence
as
" sublime "
finds
its
real
and
only
important
significance.
Neither of the
two
great
system
builders
asks
the
support
of the
other.
Their
mutual testimony, while of use
for
illustration, would be
only a source of weakness
if accepted
in a constructive
sense.
If
Swedenborg
has
given
future
spiritual
philosophy
the
legend
seen
in
one
of
his
symbolic
visions
: nunc licet intelleciualiter intrare in mysteria /idei,
he would resent any trifling with that fair instrument, the
intellect,
through
a
bias
of whatever
kind,
spiritual
or
anti-spiritual.
Kant was equally consistent
in saying to
spirits
and
to
spirit-seers
: My
mission
is
neither
to
confirm nor reject your messages, it is to define the limits
of the intellectual judgment
itself, and
to keep the mind
a
clear and
perfect instrument
for the
disposing of
all
subjects that are brought for its reception and determina-
tion.
As Kant was
necessarily
critical,
this
being the

23
office
of
the
pure
reason
itself,
so
was
Swedenborg
dogmatical, this being the office of experience.
But the
dogmas
of
Swedenborg's
experience
lie,
unlike
other
dogmas,
according
to
Swedenborg's
repeated
assevera-
tions, subject always to the verdicts of "sound reason,"
and
the soundest
reason
in
Kant
is,
as we
see,
that
wherein
his
fundamental
principles
are
identical
with
those of Swedenborg.
Professor
Vaihinger's
simile
of
the fermenting must
and
clarified
wine
is
too happy
a one
to be
rejected
altogether,
even
if the application be somewhat
faulty.
Not alone with
Swedenborg,
but
with
all
investigators,
including
especially a man Hke Kant, the crude facts of
experience
are
what
truly
constitute
the
fermenting
" must,"
so
long
as
they
have
not,
by
reduction and
clarifaction from error, become
settled into the wine of a
thoroughly
rational, harmonious, and
consistent
system.
The process of the reduction of experimental knowledge
into
rational
intelligence is what
is constantly going on.
But
it would be a mistake
to conceive of Swedenborg as
merely the collector of crude experiences, however truly
his
visa
ct audita may
impress
a
hasty
reader as such
:
his
knowledges
are
also
elsewhere
in
his own
works
reduced to the " wine " of a system as profound, as clear,
and
as
steady
as
that
of any
of
his
contemporaries.
That so able a judge as
Professor Vaihinger should find
them
in
the
clear and
vigorous
depth
of Kant's
best
reasoning,
is only another tribute to
their universal and
enduring value.

Professor Vaihinger,
in
the Archiv fur
Geschicte der
Philosophie, 1895, Berlin, calls
attention
to the work of
P.
von
Lind
:
Kmits
Mystische
Weltanschauung,
ein
Wahn der Modernen Mystik
: Munich,
1892,
in which
the author criticises Du Prel's favourable view of Kant's
so-called mystic tendency, and remarks that
:
Lind has correctly pointed
out that Du Prel has interpreted the
Triiume too favourably for Swedenborg, but
still he fails to recognise
that Kant must have had
a strong sympathy
for the metaphysical
hypotheses
which
he
brings
forward
to
explain
Swedenborg's
phantasies.
The
well-known
place
in
which
Kant
calls
certain
views
of
Swedenborg
(regarding
the
two
worlds
to
which
we
belong)
" sublime," Lind endeavours in vain to interpret ironically.
I called
Du Prel's attention to this passage, which occasioned his new edition
of
the
Kantian
" Lecture
on
Psychologic."
The
passage
also,
Heinze admits, points out an inner principidle relation between the
doctrines of both, which Kant discovered
;
indeed he
took perhaps
this doctrine of two worlds from Swedenborg
direct.
But only the
doctrine
!
Not
Swedenborg's
pretended
empirical
proofs,
which
Kant has always discarded
as phantasies.
(Compare my
Index
of
Du
Prel's edition
in
Archiv.
IV.,
722, and
also my
Extracts
in
Commentary,
II.
5i2ff).
But Du Prel
is in error, in that from that
agreement in single points of theory he concluded
that Kant would
give up his opposition to the Praxis in view of the
facts of modern
spiritism.
Lind
has done valuable
service
in showing
that Kant
knew very
familiarly
this pretended
material of facts, and
always
rejected
it with
the same determination.
Lind has shown
this by
many extracts from Kant's works, especially from the Anthropology.
On the other hand Lind goes far beyond the mark when he seeks to

INTRODUCTION.
25
dispute away the " transcendental subject " of Kant, whose relation-
ship to the
spiritual Ego of Swedenborg
is unmistakable.
This
is not
affected
either by Von
Lind's
further explanation
in
Hallier's Recension of his article
in the Altpr. Manuscript XXIX.,
449f, on these questions.
Compare also the favourable comment on
Von Lind's article by
Guttler, in the Zeitschr. f.
Philos., Bd.
104,
S.
146-152, and
also
the
there
cited
article
in
the
Zeitschrift,
" .Sphinx," 1892 and 1893.
The well-known testimony of Kant
in Jachmann, that he " has
nothing
to do
with
mysticism,"
refers
only
to
the
practices
(of
spiritism), and
to the
Mysticistii of the Feelings ;
it does not apply
to
the
rational
belief
of Kant
in
the " corpus
fnysticum
of
the
intelligible world."

IV.
Together with the German critics above cited, President
Schurman,
of Cornell
University,
in
the
Philosophical
Review for March, 1898, also makes note of the inevitable
return of Kant's mind to those ideas of the corpus mysticum,
and of a mundus intelligibilis, which he
tries
in
vain
in
his work on Swedenborg to laugh away.
Professor Schurman says
:
"The disparity between the reach and
the grasp
of his thought
engendered
in him a
bitterness
of
spirit,
the
pathos
of which
is
unknown to the mere sceptic.
Hence the
still sad music which he
that hath an ear may hear beneath the banter and
the
persiflage
of
Swedenborg and Metaphysics.
" In the
' Dreams of a Spirit-Seer,' we have the
critical
part of
the 'Right Method
in
Metaphysics.'
Here Swedenlx)rg serves as
a whipping post for the Metaphysicians whom Kant scourges most
unmercifully.
Knowledge of the supra-sensible
is put on
the same
level
with
arts of necromancy.
In the one case
it
is a dream
of
sense;
in the other a dream of reason—in both an illusion,
(p.
146.)
" But though Kant, in virtue of the divorce between
the
theor-
etical and practical element of his thought, gibed at the metaphysical
proof of those dear interests, which his heart was still open to shelter,
it required some
effort
to overcome the
rationalizing aspirations of
early years, and the struggle occasionally found vent
in a bitterness
of feeling
like
the hatred of a deserted
friend or the despair of a
rejected lover."
No better illustration of this return of Kant's mind
to
the spiritual realities
so
vividly impressed upon him by

Swedenborg could be desired than that which
is afforded
in the following extracts from Heinze's " Observations on
Kant's Lectures in Metaphysics," which fully bear out all
that Professor Vaihinger has asserted as to the deep hold
that Swedenborg's doctrine of the two worlds had taken
on
Kant's
mind.
I
have
translated
them
from
the

Geselhchaft der

chaften:

V.
EXTRACTS FROM PROFESSOR HEINZE'S
"OBSERVATIONS ON KANT'S LECTURES ON
METAPHYSICS."
As to the state of the soul after death Kant will say nothing with
assurance, since the limits of our " reason" stop here.
Nevertheless
he
speaks with
more
certainty than
one would
expect from
this
precaution !
After death
the
soul
possesses
self-consciousness,
otherwise
it
would
be
the
subject
of
spiritual
death,
which has already been
disproved.
With
this
self-consciousness
necessarily remains
per-
sonality and
the consciousness of personal
identity.
This and
the
self-consciousness
rest upon
the inner sense which remains without
body, and thus the personality remains.
But
if the body is a hindrance to life and yet the future life be the
perfect life, then
it must be purely spiritual
; the soul cannot therefore
resume its body.
If we ask as to the future place of the soul we are
not to think of the separation of the soul from the body as a change
of place,
since
the
soul
has no determined
place
in a
corporeal
world,
and,
in general, occupies no
place,
but
is
in
the
spiritual
world and in communion with spirits.
If the soul
is
in the society of good and holy beings then
it finds
itself in heaven
;
if with the evil, then
in hell.
Thus
the soul does
not enter into hell if it has lived wickedly, but it will only now find
itself in the society of evil
spirits, and
this
is called Vjeing
in
hell
and so conversely with heaven.*
Similarly
in
the
" Religion
within
the
Bounds
of
the
Pure
* Swedenborg, in
" Heaven
and
Hell," says
" That
the Lord
casts no one into hell, but evil spirits cast themselves in," &c.
(545.)

Reason," Kant shows heaven to be the Seat of Righteousness, that
is,
the
association
with
all
the
good.
The
Resurrection
and
Ascension of Christ
signify, "when
regarded
as
ideas of reason,"
the beginning of
the new
life, and
the entrance
into
the above
named
association.
(Religion
within
the
Bounds
of
the
Pure
Reason, p.
138.)
It
is remarkable how Kant proceeds
further
to describe without
any
hesitation
the
condition
of
the
soul
after
death,
in
that
it
exchanges its sensuous vision which
it enjoyed during
life, with
the
spiritual vision, and that
this is the other world l
(Tolitz,
p. 255.)
As regards the objects of that world
they remain the same
;
they
are
not
different
in
substance
but
only
changed
in
being
seen
spiritually !
Erdmann in his Kefexionen, No. 1277, remarks on this passage
:
*' The
other world
will
not
present
other
objects, but only the
same
objects
seen
(intellectually,
that
is)
in
their
relations
to
ourselves
; and the knowledge of things through
the
divine vision,
and
at
the same time the feeling of blessedness through this,
is no
longer the world but
is heaven."*
When one comes
into
the
other world
he
does
not come
into
connection with
other
things, as
if with
another
planet,
but one
remains
in
this world, only having a
ditTcrent
vision.
The
other
world
Ls heaven for me if
I have lived a righteous life and enter into
the society of such
righteous
spirits, and
therewith
enjoy
spiritual
vision.
It
is true this view of the other world cannot
be demon-
strated,
but
it
is
a necessary
hypothesis of reason (which can
be
maintained against
its opponents).
Kant here becomes so
enthusiastic as to call "very sublime" the
thought of Swedcnborg about
the
spiritual
world, which according
to him [Swcdenborg]
is
a very real
universe—even
though
in
the
work "The Dream of a Visionary," &c., he had called Swedenborg
* This reflection
of Erdmann
is evidently an attempt on the part
of the modern decadent philosophy
to adapt
Kant's
truly splendid
conception to the materialism of modern thought in explaining away
a real life after death and reducing heaven to a certain state of mind
in this world.—F. S.
t Wanting in Politr.

DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
the Arch-fanatic and enthusiast—and had remarked of his great work
that
it consists of "eight volumes full of nonsense."
That Kant here uses the word sublime in an ironic sense, as Lind
tries to show
in
his work on " Kant's Mystic View of the World,"
no one can
admit,
since Kant's view^ as here presented, bears at
least
a
resemblance
to
the
idea
of Swedenborg.
Nor
is
there
anything contradictory
in the
fact
that Kant finds something incon-
sistent
in
Swedenborg's
doctrine
of
one's
being
able
to
see
in a
certain manner the society of departed
spirits with which one's own
soul,
which
is
not
yet
departed,
stands
associated
as
a
spirit.
Natuially
;
since the soul in this world has only sensuous vision and
cannot at the same time have
spiritual vision, one cannot be wholly
in this and in the other world at the same time.
(Heinze,
p. 557.)
This
inclination
of Kant
to Swedenborg
at
the time
of
these
lectures
(1775-1780)
is
not
so
surprising,
since
in
his " Inaugural
Dissertation" Kant himself clearly distinguished between
the two
worlds, the niundus sensibilis and the inundus intelligibilis, and in
this it is probable that he was influenced by Swedenborg.
>
Kant
differs
distinctly from Swedenborg
in
that
he
docs
not
believe in the possibility of the
association of any soul which is still
bound to the body with absent souls
;
as he also rejects the idea that
souls which
spiritually
are already
in
the other world
appear
in
visible acts in this
visible world.
If we
accept
this, then
there
is
no more use of reason in this world at all, for then the spirits can be
made to account for many transactions.
It
is of this kind of vision or representation that Kant speaks in
his earlier* and
his later works.
His utterances in the "Critique"
leave
the
impression
that he has not
entirely rid himself of these
ideas of the Lectures.
In
the
"Paralogism
of
the
Pure
Reason"
(p.
230,
German
edition), he says
: " The idea that the thinking subject could have
thought before connection with the body, would be thus expressed
:
' Before the beginning of the kind of sensation wherein something
appears
to us
in space, the same transcendent objects which
in our
present
state appear as bodies may have been seen
in an
entirely
different way
!
" The idea that
the soul also after the body's death could

think, would
take
this
form
:
' If the kind
of sensation whereby
transcendental objects and those at present entirely unknown appear
as a material -world should cease,
still
all vision would not
thereljy
cease, and
it would
be quite
possible that even the same unknown
objects should continue, although
not indeed under the aspects of
bodies, but
still continue to be knowable to the thinking subject.'"
It
is true he speaks altogether
in the
critical manner regarding
these
views,
insisting
that
dogmatically
nothing can
be adduced
either
for or against them.
[Compare " Lecture on
the Philosophy of Religious Doctrine,"
p. 106
: " Of
this immediate vision of the understanding have we
as yet no notion
:
but
whether
the departed
soul, as intelligence,
instead of the sensuous
vision, may not
obtain some such
vision,
wherein, in
the
Ideas of God, he may behold
the things in them-
selves, cannot be denied, neither can
it be proved."]
Something similar, and reminding one of the
Lectures, but
still
of Swedenb<irg, we find
in the section (of the " Paralogisms of the
Pure Reason ") on the description of the Pure Reason
in regard
to
Hypothesis.
There we
read
(p.
592)
that, "one may
use
as a
weapon against materialism the argument
that
the separation from
the body
is the end
of our sense knowledge and
the beginning of
our intellectual knowledge.
The body helps the sensual and animal
part, but hinders the spiritual part of our nature.
And against other
criticisms of the doctrine of Inmiortality one may adduce the trans-
cendental hypothesis
:
"All
life
is e>^sentially only intellectual
antl
not
subject
to time
changes, neither beginning with birth nor ending with death.
This
world's
life
is only an apjKarance, a sensuous imnge
of the
pure
spiritual
life, and the whole world of sense only a picture swimming
Injfore our
present knowing
faculty
like
a dream, and having no
reality in
itself.
For if we should see things and ourselves as they
are we would
see ourselves
in a world of spiritual natures with
which our entire real relation neither began at birth nor ended with
the body's death."
One sees here Kam's strong inclination
to these views and how
easy
it
is
to establish them by his distinguishing of the appearance
from the thing
in
itself, and on his acceptance of a world of rational
beings (mundus intellit^ibilis) as a kingdom
ij{ ends to
l>e thought

as under
its own
ruler and
as necessar)' to the moral conception of
the world, even
if at the time of the "Critique" he
is afraid to insist
on these views dogmatically.
If we add
to
this
the
idea
of the corpus
viysticwii
of rational
beings
in the sense-world—that
it "consists in the free will of these
rational beings under moral laws^
this being
in
perfect
systematic
unity with the freedom of themselves and of each other,"* we cannot
wonder
that both
in modern and
earlier times the "mystics" have
claimed Kant as being of their number, even
if we can
in no case
admit that modern spiritism has any claim on him.
Jachmann has reported Kant as denying
totally that
his words
have
any
mystic
sense,
or
that
he
is
in
any way
a
friend
to
mysticism.
It
all depends on what
is meant by the mystic.
Truly
the whole idea
of freedom
is with Kant a mystic one.
Where he
differs from mysticism
is seen from the Lectures (Politz,
loi), where
he says
: "If one supposes there are thinking beings of whom one
can have intellectual vision, that
is mysticism,
so long as the vision
remains only sensual. "
From
Heinze's
"Observations
on
the
Lectures
of
1790— 91,
on
Rational
Psychology," we
quote:
When Kant
says of the
virtuous man "he
is
in heaven,"
but
cannot
see
himself
there
and
only
infers
this
from
reason,
the
statement resembles the thought of Swedenborg which Kant com-
municated
in his earlier lectures, but without clearly designating
it
as his (Swedenborg's).
Now
our
souls
are
all
as
spirits,
associated
in
this union and
society, even
in
this world
;
only here we do not
see ourselves as
being
in
this
society,
because
here
we- have only
our
sensuous
vision
;
but
although we do not
see
ourselves
in
this
society
(of
spirits), we are nevertheless
in
it.
If a man has lived righteously
in
the
world,
and
his
will
has been
well
disposed,
and he
has
endeavoured
to obey the moral
law, he
is
in
this world already in
the society of all well-disposed and righteous
souls, whether they be
in India or
in Arabia,
only he does not
see himself to be
in
this

to
Swedenborg's

This appears
to Du
Prel as the most probable explanation, and
not the intromission of Swedenborg
into the spiritual world, which
to Konl seemed even more plausible because
it corroborated his own
philosophic views regarding the ilouble nature of man.

Hypochondriac vapours,

their wont.
Holy Rome alone

the

already too venerable to

PART
FIRST,
WHICH
IS DOGMATIC.
CHAPTER
FIRST.
A COMPMCATKD METAPHYSICAL KNOT WHICH CAN BE UNTIED
OR CUT ACCORDING TO CHOICE.
If we put
all
together, that
the school-boy
rehearses,
that
the
crowd
relates,
and
that
the
philosopher
demonstrates about spirits, this would seem to
constitute
no small
part
of our knowledge.
Nevertheless,
I
dare
assert that all these smattcrers could be placed in a most
awkward embarrassment,
if it should occur to somebody
to
insist upon
the question,
just what
kind
of a
thing
that
is
about which
these
people
think
they
under-
stand
so
much.
The
methodical
talk
of
learned
institutions
is
often
simply
an
agreement
to
beg
a
question
which
is
difficult
to
solve,
by
the
variable
meaning
of words.
For we seldom
hear
at
academies
the
comfortable
and
ofttimes
reasonable
" I
do
not
know."
Certain newer philosophers,
as they
like to be
called, overcome this question
easily.
A spirit, they say,
is a being possessed of reason.
Then
it
is no miracle to

42
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
see spirits
;
for he who sees men,
sees beings possessing
reason.
But, they continue,
this being in man,
possess-
ing reason,
is
only
a
part
of man, and
this
part, the
animating part,
is a spirit.
Very well then.
Before you
prove that only a
spiritual being can have
reason,
take
care that first of all I understand what kind of conception
I must have of a spiritual being.
Self-deception in
this
matter, while large enough to be seen with eyes half-open,
is moreover of very evident
origin.
For,
later on and in
old age, we are sure to know nothing of that which was
very well known to us at an early date, as children, and
the man
of
thoroughness
finally
becomes
at
best
a
sophist in regard to his youthful delusions.
Thus
I do not know
if there are
spirits, yea, what is
more,
I
do
not
even know
what
the
word
"spirit"
signifies.i
But, as
I have often used
it myself, and have
heard others using
it, something must be understood by
it, be
this something mere fancy
or
reality.
To evolve
this hidden meaning, I wU compare my badly understood
conception of it with sundry cases of application, and, by
observing
with
which
it
conforms,
and
to
which
it
is
opposed,
I hope to unfold its hidden sense.*
* If the conception
of a
spirit were something taken out of our
own
empirical
conceptions, the procedure
to make
it
clear would
be easy
;
for we should only have
to point out those characteristics
which
the senses
reveal
to us
in that kind of beings, and whereby
we distinguish them from material things.
But people talk of spirits
even
while
it
is
doubtful
if
there
are
such
beings.
Thus
the
conception
of
spiritual nature
cannot be drawn from
experience.
But
if you ask, how could
this conception arise at
all,
if not from
experience ?
I
answer
:
many
conceptions
arise
in
secret
and

A COAfPL/CATED METAPHYSICAL KNOT.
43
Take,
for
example,
the
space
of a
cubic
foot,
and
suppose something
filling
this
space,
/>.,
resisting
the
intrusion of any other
thing.
Then nobody would
call
the
substance
occupying
that
space
" spiritual."
It
evidently would be called material, because it is expanded,
impenetrable,
and,
like everything
corporeal, subject to
divisibility and
to the laws of impact.
Thus
far we are
still on
the smooth
track
of
other
philosophers.
But
imagine
a simple
being,
and impart
to
it
at the same
time reason.
Would
that,
then,
comprise the meaning
of
"spirit?"
To
discover
this,
I
will
leave
to
the
aforesaid simple being
reason
as an
inner
quality, and
will
consider
that
being
only
in
its
external
relations.
And now
I ask,
if
I want to place
this simple substance
in that space of one cubic
foot, which
is
full of matter,
would
a
single
element
have
to make room
for
it, so
that
the
spirit
might
enter?
You
think
yes?
Very
well, then
this
supposed
space
would
have
to
lose
a
second
elementary
particle — were
it
to
take
in
a
second
spirit, and
thus,
if you
keep
on,
a
cubic
foot
oljscure
conclusions
incidental
to
experiences,
and afterwards are
transmitted
to other minds without even the
consciousness of that
exjH'rience
or
conclusion
which
has
first
established
the
con-
ception.
Such concei>Uf)ns may
be
called
"surreptitious."
Many
of that kind are
partly
only delusions of imajjination,
partly
also
true, since obscure conclusions do
not always
err.
Usage, and the
context
in difTcreiit
accounts in which the same expression is found,
give
to
the
expression
a
definite
meaning.
This
meaning
can,
therefore,
be
evolved
by
drawing
this
hidden
sense
out
of
its
obscurity through a comjiarison of sundry cases of application, so as
to see with which
it agrees, and which
it contradicts.

44
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
of space would be
filled with
spirits whose mass
exists
just
as
well
by
impenetrability,
as
if
it
was
full
of
matter, and,
just
like the
latter, must be
subject to the
laws of impact.
But substances
of this
kind, although
they might contain the power of reason, would not differ
at all from the elements of matter of which also we know
only the
powers
which
they
exert
externally by
their
very existence, and do not at all know what might belong
to their interior qualities.
Thus
it
is beyond doubt that
simple substances of that
kind,
of which masses could
be accumulated,
would not
be
called
spiritual
beings.
You will, therefore, be able to retain the conception of a
spirit
only
if you imagine
beings who can be
present
even
in a space filled with matter,* thus beings who do
not
possess
the
quality
of
impenetrability,
and
who
never form a solid whole, no matter how many you unite.
Simple beings of this kind would be
called immaterial
beings,
and,
if
they
have
reason,
spirits.
But simple
substances
which,
if
combined,
result
in
an expanded
and impe7ietrable whole, would be called material units,
* It will be easily recognized
that
I am speaking only of spirits
which are
parts of the
universe, and not
of infinite
spirit which
is
originator and
preserver of the universe.
For the conception of the
spiritual
nature
of
infinite
spirit
is
easy,
because
it
is
merely
negative, and
consists
in
the
denial
of those
qualities
of matter
which conflict with infinite and absolutely necessary substance.
But
with a spiritual substance, which is to be conjoined with matter, as
is
the
case with
the human
soul, the
difficulty
arises
that
I must
conceive of a mutual combination of it with corporeal beings for the
sake of forming a whole, and yet must remove
the only connective
w'hich is known to exist among material beings.

A COMPLICATED METATHYSICAL KNOT.
45
and their whole, matter.
Either
the name of a
spirit
is
a mere word without any meaning,
or,
its significance
is
of the nature described.
From the explanation of what a spirit consists in
it
is a
long step indeed to the proposition that such natures are
real,
yea,
even
possible.
We
find
in
the
works
of
philosophers many good and
reliable
proofs that every-
thing
which
thinks
must
be
simple
;
and
that
every
substance which thinks according
to
reason, must be a
unit of nature
; and that the undivisible Ego could not be
divided among many connected things which make up a
whole.
My soul, therefore, must be a simple substance.
But this proof leaves
still undecided, whether the soul be
of the nature of such things as, united in space, form an
expanded and
impenetrable whole
;
whether,
therefore,
it
be
material,
or whether
it
be
immaterial, and,
con-
sequently,
a
spirit
;
and, what
is
more, whether such
beings as are called spirits, are possible.
At this point
I cannot but recommend caution against
rash conclusions which enter most easily into the deepest
and obscurest
(juestions.
For that which belongs to the
common conceptions of experience
is commonly regarded
as
if the reason why
it existed was
also comprehended.
But
of
that
which
differs from experience, and
cannot
be made comprehensible by any
experience,
not
even
by
analogy,
we
of
course
can
form
no
conception,
and,
therefore,
are
apt
to
reject
it
immediately
as
impossible.
All matter offers resistance
in the space in
which
it
is
present,
and
on
that
account
is
called

46
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
impenetrable.
That
this
is
so,
experience
teaches
us,
and the abstraction of this experience produces in us the
general conception of matter.
But this resistance which
something makes in the space in which
it is present,
is in
that
manner
indeed
recognized^
but
not
yet
conceived.
For
this
resistance,
as
everything
that
counteracts an
action,
is true
force, and,
as
its
direction
is opposed to
the prolonged lines of approach,
it is a force of repulsion
which must be attributed to matter and,
therefore, to its
elements.
Every
reasonable man
will
readily concede
that here human
intelligence has reached
its
limit.
For
while, by experience alone, we can perceive that things of
this
world
which we
call
" material "
possess
such
a
force,
we
can
never conceive
of
the
reason why they
exist."
Now,
if
I
suppose
other
substances
being
present
in space with other forces than
that propelling
force which has for its consequence impenetrability, then,
of course,
I cannot think in the concrete of their activity,
because
it
has no analogy
with my
conceptions
from
experience.
And
if, in addition,
I take away from those
substances the quality to Jill the space in which they are
present,
I miss a conception which makes thinkable the
things which come within the range of my senses
; thence,
necessarily,
they
must become
in a way
unthinkable.
But
this cannot be said to be a recognized impossibility,
for the very reason that the possibility of the existence of
its opposite remains also unintelligible, although its reality
comes within the range of my senses.
, The
possibility of the existence of immaterial
beings

47
can,
therefore,
be
supposed
without
fear
of
its
being
disproved, but also without hope of proving
it by reason.
Such spiritual
natures would be present in space in such
a manner that
it would
still
be penetrable
for corporeal
beings.
For by their presence they operate in space, but
do not fill
it,
i.e., they cause no resistance, which
is
the
basis of solidity.-'',
If such a simple spiritual substance be
supposed,—notwithstanding
its
indivisibility,— it can
be
said that the space where
it
is immediately present is not
a
point,
but
itself a
space.
For, calling
in
the aid
of
analogy,
even
the
simple
elements
of
the
body
must
occupy there a space which
is a proportionate part of
its
whole extension, inasmuch
as
points
are
not
parts
but
limits
of space.
Thus
space
is
filled by means of an
active
force—repulsion.
But
the
fact
that
it
is
being
filled
is apparent
only by a greater
activity of
its com-
ponents.
The way, therefore, in which
it
is being
filled
—by accumulating
individual elements—does not
at
all
conflict with its simple nature, although the possibility of
this cannot
be
pointed
out more
clearly,
for
this can
never
be done
with
first
causes and
effects.
In
the
same way
I
shall meet
with
at
least no demonstrable
impossibility,
although
the
thing
itself remains incom-
prehensible,
if
I state that a spiritual substance, although
it
is simple, still can occupy a space,
i.e., can immediately
be active
in
it
without filling
it,
which means
without
offering resistance to material substances in
it.'
Such an
immaterial substance
also could not be said
to
possess
expansion, any more than the units of matter.
For only

48
DREAMS OF A SPIRirSEER.
that which, existing separate and for itself alone, occupies
a
space, possesses extent
; but the substances which are
elements
of matter occupy space
only by
the
exterior
effect which they have upon others.
But
for themselves
alone, where no other things can be thought of as being
in connection with them, and as
they contain
in them-
selves nothing which could
exist
separately, they contain
no
space.
This
applies
to
corporeal
elements.
The
same would apply also
to
spiritual
natures.
The
limits
of extent are determined by the figure of a thing.
Con-
sequently,
we
cannot
think
of
the
figures
of
spiritual
natures.
These are reasons
for the supposed
possibility
of the existence of immaterial beings in the universe, but
they can be comprehended with
difficulty.
He who
is
in possession of means which can lead more easily to this
intelligence, should not deny instruction to one eager
to
learn,
before whose
eyes,
in
the progress
of research,
Alps often rise where others see before them a
level and
comfortable
footpath
on
which
they
walk
forward,
or
think they do so.
Suppose now
that
it had been
proved
that
the
soul
of man
is
a
spirit
(although
it may be
seen from
the
preceding
that
this, as
yet,
has not been
proved), then
the next question which
might be
raised
is—Where
is
the
place
of
this human
soul
in
the
corporeal world?
I would answer,
that body the changes of which are my
changes,
is my body, and
its place
is, at the same time,
my place.
If the question be continued, where then
is
your
(your
soul's)
place
in
that
bodyl
then
I
might

A COMPLICATED METAPHYSICAL KNOT.
49
suspect that there
is a catch
in the question.
For
it
is
easily
observed
that
it
presupposes
something
which
is
not
known
by
experience,
but
rests,
perhaps,
in
inaginary conclusions, namely,
that my thinking Ego
is
in a place which differs from the places of other parts of
that body which
belongs
to me.
Nobody,
however,
is
conscious of occupying a separate place in his body, but
only of that place which he occupies as man in regard to
the
world
around
him.
I
would,
therefore,
keep
to
common experience, and would
say,
provisionally, where
I
sense,
there
I
amj'
I am
just
as immediately in the
tips
of my
fingers,
as
in my
head.
It
is
myself who
suffers
in
the
heel and whose
heart
beats
in
affection.
I
feel
the
most
painful
impression
when
my
corn
torments me,
not
in a
cerebral
nerve,
but
at
the end
of my toes.
No experience teaches me to believe some
parts
of my
sensation
to
be removed
from
myself,
to
shut up my Ego
into
a
microscopically
small
place
in
my
brain
from whence
it may move
the
levers
of my
body-machine, and
cause me
to
be
thereby
affected.
I'hus
I should demand a strong proof to make incon-
sistent what the schoolmasters say
: my soul is as a whole
in my whole body, and
21'holly in each part.
Common
sense often perceives a truth before comprehending the
reasons with which
to prove or explain
it.
I should not
be entirely disconcerted by the objection, that thus
I am
believing that the soul possesses extension and
is diffused
through the whole body, just as
it
is pictured for children
in the " orbis pictus."
For
I would remove this obstacle

50
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
by saying
:
the
fact
that the soul
is present in the whole
body
goes
only
to
prove
the
extent
of
its
sphere
of
exterior
activity, but not a multiplicity of
its inner parts
and thus no extension
or
figure,
for these exist only in
a being which occupies a space set apart for itself,
i.e.,
if
the
being
contains
parts
which
exist
outside
of
each
other.
Finally,
I should either claim to know
this
little
of the spiritual quality of my soul,
or,
if that should not
be conceded,
I should be
satisfied that
I know nothing
about
it.
If one would
insist upon showing how incomprehen-
sible, or, what amounts
to the same for the most people,
how impossible
these thoughts are, I would admit even
that
; and then I would
sit down
at
the feet of the wise
to hear them talk as follows
: The soul of man has its seat
in the brain, and its abode there is indescribably small ;*
* There are examples of injuries whereby a good part of the brain
has
been
lost
without
causing
the
loss
of
life
or
of
thought.
According
to
the common
conception,
which
I
quote
here,
the
removal
of an atom
would
have been
sufficient
to
cause
instant
death.
The
prevalent opinion which
assigns to the soul
its seat in
the
brain,
seems
to
originate
mainly
in
the
fact,
that we
feel
distinctly how, in deep meditation, the nerves of the brain are taxed.
But if this conclusion
is right
it would prove also other abodes of the
soul.
In anxiety
or joy the sensation seems
to have its seat in the
heart.
Many
affections,
yea most
of them,
manifest
themselves
most
strongly
in
the diaphragm.
Pity moves
the
intestines, and
other instincts
manifest
their origm
in other organs.
The reason
why
the meditating
soul seems
to
feel
especially
in
the brain
is,
perhaps, the following.
All meditating requires the instrumentality
of
sigtis
that
ideas may be
created,
and
that,
accompanied
and
supported by
these
signs, the required amount of clearness may be
attained.
But

parts of the body,
is represented
as an
object which
is
present
outside
of the
brain.
From
this
seat
it moves
the
ropes and
levers
of the
whole
machinery, causing
arbitrary movements
at
will.
Such
propositions can be
proved only very superficially
or
not
at
all, and
as
the
nature
of the
soul
is, indeed, not
well enough known,
they can be just as weakly combatted.
And so
I do not
care to join
in
that
kind
of learned
dispute, in
which
both
parties
usually
have
most
to
say about
that
of
which they know
nothing.
But
I
will
follow
only
the
conclusions to which a doctrine of this
nature must lead
me."
In
the
first instance, according to the propositions
so much recommended
to
me, my
soul does not differ
from any element
of matter
in
the way
in which
it
is
present in space.
Further, the power of reasoning
is an
internal
(juality
which
I
could
not
perceive
anyhow,
received
either
by
hearing
or
sight,
both
of
which
senses
arc
stimulated by impressions
in the
l)rain, as their organs are also next
to this part.
Now,
if the
production of these signs which Cartesius
calls " ideas miiterialcs," is properly an irritation of the nerves such
a.s
to
produce a movement
similar
to
that which
fornierly caused
the
sensation,
then,
in
meditation,
the
tissue
of the
brain
will
be compelled
to quiver
as
with
the
former
impressions and
it
is
chiefly
the
brain,
theiefore,
th.nt
will
liecome
tired.
Hut,
if
the
thinking be accompanied by alTcclions, we
feel
not only the
brain
to be
taxed,
but
also
those
irritable
parts which,
usually,
are
in
sympathy with the soul.

although
it might be found in all
these elements.
From
these
considerations
no
valid
reason
can
be
brought
forward, why my soul should not be one of the substances
of which matter consists, nor why
its peculiar manifesta-
tions should not originate in the place which
it occupies
in such an ingenious machine as the human body, where
the combination
of nerves favours
the
inner
faculty of
thinking
and
of
will-power.
In
that
case,
however,
there would remain no peculiar characteristic of the soul
by which
it could be surely recognized and distinguished
from
crude elementary
matter, and
the
jocose
sugges-
tion
of Leibnitz would not be laughable any more, that
in our
coffee we swallow,
perhaps, atoms which
are
to
become human souls.
But in such a case would not this
thinking Ego be subjected to the common fate of material
natures, and,
as
it was drawn out
of the
chaos
of all
elements to vivify an animal machine, why should
it not,
after this casual combination has ceased, return in future
to its origin ?
It
is
at
times
necessary
to
frighten
the
thinker who
is on the wrong
path, by the consequences,
so that he may pay more
attention
to
the principles by
which he has been led off as in a dream.
I confess
that
I arn very much inclined
to assert the
existence of immaterial natures
in the world, and
to put
my soul
itself into that class of beings."*
But then, how
* The reason of this, which appears to myself very obscure, and
probably
will remain
so,
concerns
at
the same
time
that
which
sensates in animals.
Whatever in the world contains a principle of
life, seems to be
of immaterial
nature.
For

But,
at
the same
time, how natural
that
it
is
incomprehensible,
inasmuch
as
our
conceptions
of
external actions
are derived from
those of
matter, and
are always connected with the conditions of impact and
pressure, which do not exist in this case.
For how could
an
immatt^rial
being
be
such
an
obstruction
so
that
matter in
its motion could collide with
it, a spirit
; and
how could corporeal things act upon an unknown being
which does not oppose them
with
impenetrability, and
which does
not hinder them
in any way from being at
the same time present
in the space in which
it
is itself?
It seems
that a
spiritual essence
is inmostly present
in
matter, and that
it does not act upon those forces which
determine the mutual relations of elements, but upon the
inner principle of their state.
For every substance, even
a simple element of matter, must have an inner activity

power.*
But the essential characteristic of matter
is
that
it
fills space by a
necessary
force which
is
limited
by
counteraction
from
without.
Thus the stale of everything that
is material
is externally dependent
and
forced.
But
those entities which are saiil
to contain the cause
of
life, which
act from themselves and
from
inner jxjwer, in
short,
the
intrinsic nature of which
is
l(j
Ik; able
to chanyje themselves at
will, can hardly be said
to be
material.
It
cannot
reasonably be
expected
that we
understand,
in
their
sub-divisions,
under
their
various
species, such unknown
beings,— the existence of which we
know for the most part only by hypothesis.
We can
see, however,
that those immaterial
beings which contain the cause of animal
life,
are dilTerent
from those which comprise reason in their self-activity,
and are called
spirits."

as the reason for its external efficiency, although
I cannot
specify in what
it consists.*
^
But what
is the necessity which causes a spirit and a
body to form a unit
; and, again, what is the cause which
breaks up
this
unit
in
case
of
certain
disturbances ?
These
are
questions
which, among
various
others,
are
above my intelligence.^"
And although
I have as a rule
hardly the daring to measure my power of reasoning with
the
secrets
of
nature,
I
should,
nevertheless,
have
sufficient
confidence
not
to
be
afraid,
in such a
case,
of putting any opponent to the
test,
if it were my nature
to be inclined to fight, nor of attempting to refute him by
contrary
reasons,
which
with
scholars
means
nothing
else but the art of convincing another that he does not
know.
* Leibnitz says that
this inner reason of all
the external relations
and changes
of a
substance
is
the power of conception, and
later
philosophers received this undeveloped thought with laughter.
But
they would have done
better
if they had
first considered whether
a substance
of the nature
of a simple
particle of matter is possible
without any inner state.
If then they would not have excluded such
a state, it would have been incumbent upon them to think out another
possible inner state than that of conceptions and the activities which
depend upon them.
Everybody recognizes at once
that, even
if a
power of obscure conceptions
is conceded- te,.tli[e simple elementary
parts of matter,
it does not follow thence that matter itself possesses
power of conception, because many substances of that kind, united
into a whole, can yet never form a thinking unit.

AIMING
TO
ESTABLISH
COMMUNION WITH THE SPIRIT-WORLD.
Gross

cleaves
to
the

I trust, by this time become so accustomed to higher
and
abstract
conceptions
that now
it can

in
that dusk
in
which the
faint

kingdom
of shadows.

will
venture
therefore upon
the dangerous road, since we have endured such laborious
preparation for
it.

The characteristics of the dead
matter which

are

;
it
further
possesses
solidity,
expansion, and
form,
and
its
manifestations,
resulting from
all
these
three
causes, admit
of physical
explanations, which, at the same time, are mathematical,
and,
collectively,
are
called
mechanical.
But
let
us
direct our attention to the kind of beings which contain
the cause of life
in
the
universe—those which
therefore
neither add to the mass and extent of lifeless matter, nor
are influenced by
it according to the laws of contact and

collision, but which rather, by inner activity, move them-
selves
and
dead
matter
as
well—and
we
shall
find
ourselves
convinced,
if
not
with
the
distinctness
of
demonstration,
still with the presentiment of well applied
reason, that immaterial beings exist.
Their peculiar laws
of operation we may
call
"spiritual,"
or,
in
so
far as
bodies are the medium of their operation in the
material
world, "organic."
As these immaterial beings are
self-
active
principles,
consequently,
substances and
natures
existing by
themselves,
the
conclusion
which
suggests
itself
first
is,
that, immediately united with each
other,
they might form, perhaps, a great whole which might be
called the immaterial world (mundus
intelligibilis).
For
what reason could render the assertion probable that such
beings
of
similar
nature
could
communicate
only
by
means of other beings
(corporeal)
of dissimilar nature ?
This
latter
supposition
would
really
be much
more
mysterious than the
first.
This immaterial world, therefore, can be regarded as a
whole existing by itself, and
its parts, as being
in mutual
conjunction and intercourse without the instrumentality
of anything corporeal.
The relation by means of things
corporeal
is consequently
to be regarded as accidental
it can belong only to a few
;
yea, where we meet with
it,
it does not hinder even those very immaterial beings, while
acting upon one another through matter, from standing also
in their special universal relationship, so that at any time
they may exercise upon one another mutual influences by
virtue of the
laws
of their immaterial
existence.
''Their

57
relation by means of matter
is thus accidental, and
is due
to a special divine
institution, while
their
direct
relation
is natural and
insoluble.^^
By combining
in this way
all
principles of
life in the
whole
of
nature,
as
so
many
incorporeal
substances,
communicating with each other, partly also united with
matter, we conceive of the immaterial world
as a great
whole,
an
immeasurable
but
unknown
gradation
of
beings
and
active
natures
by
which
alone
the
dead
matter of the
corporeal
world
is endued with
life.
But
to which members
of nature
life
is exttjnded, and which
those degrees of it are which are next to utter lifelessness,
can,
perhaps,
never
be
made
out
with
certainty.^-
Hylozoism imputes
life to everything
;
materialism, care-
fully considered, kills everything^
Maupertuis attributed

the
lowest degree of
life, other philosophers see in them
nothing
else
but
dead
masses
which
serve
only
to
augment the lever-apparatus of animal
machines.^-^
The
undoubted
characteristic of
life
in that which appeals to
our external
senses
is,
I may
say,
the
free movement
which shows
that
it
is
arbitrary, but
the conclusion
is
not
certain
that,
wherever
this
characteristic
is
not
found, there
is no degree of
life.^^
Boerhave says some-
where
: The animal
is a plant which has
its roots in the
stomach (inside).
Another might, perhaps, play without
censure with these conceptions by saying
: The plant
is
an animal which has
its stomach in the
root
(outside).
The
plants,
therefore, may
lack

movement, and
thus
the
external
characteristics of
life.
These
are
necessary
to
the
animals,
because
a
being
which
has
the instruments of nourishment
inside must
be
able
to move about according
to
its needs
;
but
a
being
where
these
are
outside
and
planted
in
the
nourishing element,
is already
sufficiently maintained by
external
forces.
Such
a
being
contains
indeed
a
principle of inner
life
in
the
fact
of vegetation,
yet
it
does
not
need
an
organic
apparatus
for
external
free
activity.
I
do
not
propose
to
use
any
of
these
considerations as evidence,
for, aside from the fact that I
could
say very
little
in favour of such conjectures, they
have the ridicule of fashion against them, as being dusty
antiquated
fancies.
The ancients, namely, thought that
they could assume three kinds of
life, the vegetable, the
animal, and the reasonable.
In uniting in man the three
immaterial
principles
of those
kinds
of
life,
they
very
likely
erred
;
but
so
far
as
they
distributed
the
three
principles among
the
three
kinds
of
growing
beings
which propagate their kind, they indeed
said something
undemonstrable, but not, on that account, unreasonable,
especially not in the judgment of one who considers the
close relation of the polyps and other zoophytes with the
plants,
or
who
takes
into
account
the
special
life
belonging
to
the
separated
parts
of
some
animals,
irritability—that quality of the
fibres of an animal body
and of some
plants,
so
well demonstrated, and,
at the
same time, so inexplicable.
But, after all, the appeal
to
immaterial
principles
is a subterfuge of bad philosophy.

A FRAGMENT OF SECRET PHILOSOPHY.
59
Explanations of that kind should be avoided as much as
possible, so that those causes
of the
world's phenomena
which
rest on
the
laws
of motion of matter alone, and
which solely and alone are capable of being conceived,
may be recognized in their
full extent.^'
Nevertheless,
I
am
convinced
that
vStahl, who
likes
to explain animal
processes
organically,
is
often
nearer
to
the
truth than
Hofmann,
Boerhave, and
others, who
leave immaterial
forces out of their plan and keep to mechanical
reasons.
Yet
these follow thereby a more philosophical method,
which sometimes perhaps
fails, but oftener proves
right,
and which alone can be applied
to advantage in science.
For the
influence
of beings of
incorporeal
nature can
only be said
to exist, but
it can never be shown how
it
proceeds, nor how far
its efficiency extends. '*'
The
immaterial
then
would
primarily
comprise
all
created intelligences.
Some of these are combined with
matter, thus forming a person, and some not.
It further
comprises the sensating subjects
in
all kinds of animals,
and
finally all
the
principles of
life wherever
in
nature
they may be
found, although such
life may
not make
itself evident by the external characteristics of arbitrary
movement.
All these immaterial natures,
I say, whether
they exercise
their influences
in
the corporeal
world or
not, and
all
the
rational beings who are, accidentally, in
an
animal
state,
here on
earth
or on
other
terrestrial
bodies, while they may be
vivifying gross matter now or
in
future,
or may
have
done
so
in
the
past,

theless form, according to these conceptions, a communion

in conformity with their nature.^'
And
this communion
would not rest upon the conditions by which the relations
of
bodies
are
limited,
but
distance
in
space
and
time,^^ which forms
in
the
visible world
the
great
cleft
severing
all communion, would
disappear.
We should,
therefore, have
to regard the human soul as being con-
joined
in
its
present
life with two worlds
at
the same
time,
of
which
it
clearly
perceives
only
the
material
world, in so far as
it
is conjoined with a body, and thus
forms
a
personal
unit.^^
But
as
a member
of
the
spiritual
world
it
receives
and
gives
out
the
pure
influences
of
immaterial
natures,
so
that,
as
soon
as
the
accidental
conjunction
has
ceased, only
that com-
munion remains which
at
all times
it has with
spiritual
natures.-'^ *
* If one speaks of heaven as the seat of the happy, common con-
ception
likes
to
place
it
above,
high
up
in
the
immeasurable
universe.
But one does
not consider
that our earth, viewed from
those
regions, must
also appear
as one of the
stars of heaven, and
that the inhabitants of other w orlds, with as good reason, may point
to
us and
say,
"See
there
the
dwelling-place
of eternal
joys, a
heavenly abode, prepared to receive us some day."-'
For a queer
illusion makes the high
flight whicli hope
takes, always to be con-
nected with
the idea of rising
physically, without considering that
however high we may have
risen, we have to descend again to land
eventually
in
another
world.
According
to
the
ideas just men-
tioned, heaven would be properly the
i-piril-world, or, perhaps, the
happy part of it, and
this we would have
to seek neither above nor
below, because such an immaterial whole must be conceived of, not
according
to the further or nearer distances of corporeal things, but
according to the spiritual connections of
its parts with each other.
Its members,
at
least,
are conscious of themselves only according
to such relations.^-

.4 FRAGMENT OF SECRET PHILOSOPHY.
6i
It begins to be a real trouble for me, always to use the
cautious
language
of
reason.
Why should
I,
too,
not
be allowed
to
talk
in academical style ?
This exempts
the
writer as
well
as
the reader
from
thinking,
which,
after
all,
sooner
or
later must
lead
only
to annoying
indecision.
Thus " it
is as good as demonstrated," or, to
be
explicit, "it could
easily be
proved," or
still
better,
" it will be proved " I don't know where or when, that the
liuman
soul
also
in
this
life
forms
an
indissoluble
communion
with
all
immaterial
natures
of
the
spirit-
world,
that, alternately,
it acts upon and receives impres-
sions
from
that
world
of which
nevertheless
it
is
not
conscious
while
it
is
still man and as long
as everything
is
in
proper
condition.-^
On
the
other
hand
it
is
l)rol)able that the spiritual natures on their side can have
no
immediate
conscious
sensation
of
the
corporeal
world,^* because they are not conjoined with any part of
matter which could make them aware
of their place in
the material world-whole, nor have they elaborate organs
for entering into the mutual relations of beings of spacial
extent.
But
they
can,
probably,
flow
into the souls of
men
as into beings of their own
nature, and
it
is
likely
that they are actually
at
all times
in mutual intercourse
with
them,
yet,
in
such
a
way
that
those
conceptions
which
the
soul
entertains
as a being dependent on the
corporeal
world
cannot
be communicated
to
the other
purely spiritual beings
;
nor can the conceptions of these
latter,
being
conceptions
of
immaterial
things,
be
transferred into the consciousness of men, at least not as

62
DREAMS OF A SPIRITSEER.
long as these conceptions preserve their pecuHar quahty,
for
the
components
of
the
two
sets
of
ideas
are
of
different kind.
It would be beautiful
if such a systematic constitution
of
the
spirit-world,
as
we
conceive
it,
could
be
determined,
or
only
with
some
probability
supposed,
not
merely
from
the
conception
of
spiritual
being
in
general, which
is altogether too hypothetical, but from an
actual and universally conceded observation.
Therefore
I venture upon the indulgence of the reader and
insert
here
an
attempt
at
something
of
this
kind
which,
although
somewhat
out
of my
way,
and
far
enough
removed
from
evidence,
still
seems
to
give
occasion
for not unpleasant surmises.
******
Among the forces which move the human heart, some
of the most powerful seem
to
lie outside of
it.
They
consequently
are
not
mere
means
to
selfishness
and
private
interest, which would be an aim
lying inside of
man himself, but they incline our emotions to place the
focus
in which
they combine,
outside
of
us,
in
other
rational beings.
\ Thence
arises
a
struggle between two
forces, the proprium which refers everything to itself, and
the
public
spirit by which
the mind
is driven or drawn
towards others outside of itself-^
I do not dwell upon
that instinct which causes us
to depend so much and so
universally
upon
the judgment
of
others,
to
consider
outside
approbation
or
applause
requisite
to
a
good
opinion of ourselves.

of honour comes up in this matter, but nevertheless there
is even
in
the most
unselfish and open natures a secret
leaning to compare with the judgment of others what we
have by ourselves recognized
to be good and true, so as
to make both concordant
; on the other hand there is an
inclination
to
stop, so to speak, each human soul on
its
way to knowledge, when
it seems to go anothei path than
that
upon
which
we
have
entered.
All
this
comes,
perhaps, from our perception
of the dependence of our
own judgment upon
the common
sense of man, and
it
becomes a reason
for ascribing to the whole of thinking
beings a sort of unity of reason.
But
I
pass
over
this
otherwise
not
unimportant
consideration,
and,
for
the
present,
take
up
another
which,
as
far
as
our
purpose
is
concerned,
is
more
obvious and
pertinent.
N\'hen we consider our needs in
relation
to
our
environment, we
cannot do
it
without
experiencing a certain
sensation of restraint and
limita-
tion which
lets
us know
that a foreign
will,
as
it were,
is
active
in
us, and
that
our own
liking
is
subject
to
the
condition
of
external
consent.
A
secret
power
compels
us
to
adapt
our
intentions
to
the
welfare
of
others, or to
this foreign
will, although this is often done
unwillingly,
and
conflicts
strongly
with
our
selfish
inclination.
The
point
to which
the
lines of direction
of our impulses converge,
is thus not only
in ourselves,
but
there are
besides powers moving
us
in the
will
of
others
outside
of
our.sehes.
Hence
arise
the
moral
impulses
which
often
carry
us
away
to
the
discern-

64
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
fiture
of
selfishness,
the
strong
law
of
duty, and
the
weaker one of benevolence.
Both of these wring from
us many
a
sacrifice, and
although
selfish
inclinations
now and then preponderate over both, these
still never
fail
to
assert
their
reality
in human
natur^.
Thus we
recognize
that,
in
our
most
secret
motives,
we
are
dependent
upon
the
rule
of
the
zvill
of
all,
and
thence
arises
in
the community
of
all
thinking beings
a moral
iinity, and a systematic
constitution according
to purely
spiritual
laws.-*'
If we want
to
call
the
fact
that we
feel forced
to adapt our
will
to the
will of
all,
the sense of morality, we thereby describe only a manifest-
ation
of that which
actually takes
place
in
us, without
settling
upon
its
causes.
Thus
Newton

established
law
that
all
particles
of
matter

the
tendency
to approach each
other,

because
he did not want to have his mathematical demonstrations
mixed up with
possible philosophical
disputes over the
causes of gravitation.
Nevertheless, he did not
hesitate
to
treat
gravitation as
the true effect of a general
inter-
action of matter, and
therefore gave to
it also the name
of attraction}'

world attains
its unity, namely, by conforming
itself to a
system of
spiritual
perfection, according
to the
laws
of
this sense of morality, which would constitute
its mode
of cohesion. y
If we grant
to
these
thoughts
so much
probability as
to make
it worth while
to measure them
by their consequences, we shall be drawn by their charm,
perhaps unconsciously, into being
partial
to them.
For
in this case there seem to disappear most of the irregulari-
ties which otherwise, owing to the contradiction between
the moral and
physical
relations of men
here on earth,
strike us as being so strange.
The moral quality of our
actions
can, according
to
the order of nature, never be
fully worked out
in the bodily
life of men, but
it can be
so worked out
in the
spirit-world, according
to
spiritual
laws.-^ \ The
true purposes, the secret
motives of many
endeavours, fruitless by impotency, the victory over
self,
or
the
occasional
hidden treachery
in apparently good
actions, are mostly lost
as
to their physical
effect
in the
bodily state, but in the immaterial world they would have
to
be
regarded
as
fruitful
causes,
and,
consequently,
according
to
spiritual
laws
and
on
account
of
the
connection between
the
individual will and
the
will
of
all,
they
would
mutually
[jroduce
and
receive
effects
appropriate to the moral
quality
of
free
will.
For just
because
the
morality
of an
action
concerns the
inner
state of the
spirit,
it naturally can only in the immediate
communion
of
spirits have an
effect adecjuate to
its
full
morality.
Thus
it would happen that man's soul would
already
in
this
life
have
to
take
its
place among

its
moral state, just
as, according to the laws of motion, the
matter
of
the
universe
arranges
itself
into
an
order
conformable
to
its

forces.*
When
finally
through death the communion of the soul with the body-
world is abolished,

in
the other world would be only
a

continuation
of
such
connections
as
were
formed

already
in

all the conse-
quences
of the
morality

find

be, as
it
were, out
of one

This
latter circumstance is of especial
importance.
For
in a
speculation
based
merely upon
reasoning there
is
a great
difficulty
if, in removing the
inconvenience
which
follows
from
the
incomplete
harmony of morality and
its consequences in this world,
we have to resort to an extraordinary idea
of the
divine
will.
For, though
our judgment of

remain that the weak
conceptions
of our understanding
were
applied
to
the Highest perhaps very erroneously.
For
it
is incumbent upon man to judge of the divine will
only from
the harmony which
he
actually
perceives
in
the world, or which, by the
rule of analogy, according to
the order of nature,
'^i he may suppose to be in

of his own wisdom which he prescribes to the divine will.
******
We now turn our consideration again
into the former
path, and approach
the aim which we have
set
before
ourselves.
If the
facts of the spirit-world be such as we
have
stated, and
the
share
of our
soul
in
it
be
truly
pictured
in the sketch just made, then scarcely anything
appears more strange than
that communion with
spirits
is not quite a common and ordinary thing
; and what
is
extraordinary about
it
is rather the scarcity of apparitions
than their
possibility.
This difficulty
is tolerably easy to
remove and already has been partly removed.
For the
conception
which
the
soul
of man
has
of
itself as
of
a
spirit, which, moreover,
it has obtained through con-
templation of the immaterial,
i.e., by observing
itself in
its
relation
to
beings of similar
nature,
this conception
is
entirely
different
from
that where
its
consciousness
conceives
itself
as
a
man,
by
means
of
an
image
originated in the impression of corporeal organs and con-
ceived of in relation to none but corporeal things.
It
is,
therefore, indeed one subject, which
is thus at the same

DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
time a member of the visible and of the invisible world,
but not one and the same person
; for, on account of their
different
quality,
the conceptions of the one world
are
not ideas associated with those of the other world, thus,
what
I think as spirit,
is not remembered by me as man,
and,
conversely, my
state as man does not
at
all
enter
into the conception of myself as a spirit.
Moreover, my
ideas
of
the
spirit-world
may
be
ever
so
clear
and
perspicuous,* still that would not
sufifice to make me, as
* This may be elucidated by a certain double
personality which
belongs
to
the soul even
in
this
life.
Certain philosophers think
that, without
fear of the least
objection, they can refer
to
the state
of sound sleep when they want
to prove the reality of obscure ideas,
since nothing can be said about that state with certainty, except that,
in the waking state, we do not remember any of the ideas which we
might have had
in sound sleep.
From
this
fact, however, follows
only
this much, that the
ideas were not
clearly represented while
we were waking
up, but
not
that
they were obscure
also while we
slept.
I
rather suppose
that
ideas
in
sleep may be
clearer and
broader than even
the clearest
in the waking state.
This
is
to be
expected of such an active being as the soul when the external senses
are so completely at rest.
For man, at such times,
is not sensible of
his body.
When he wakes up
his body is
not associated with the
ideas of his sleep,
so
that
it
cannot be a means of recalling
this
former state of thought to consciousness in such a way as to make
it
appear
to belong to one and
the same
person.
A confirmation of
my idea of sound
sleep
is found in the activity of some who walk in
their sleep, and who, in such a
state, betray more
intelligence than
usual,
although
in
waking up
they do
not
remember
anything.
Dreams, however,
i.e., the
ideas which one remembers
in waking
up, do not belong
here.
For then man does not wholly sleep, he
perceives
to a certain degree
clearly, and weaves the actions of his
spirit
into
the impressions of
the
external
senses.
He
therefore
remembers them in part afterwards, but
finds in them only wild and
absurd chimeras, since ideas of phantasy and of external sensation
are intermingled in them.

a man, conscious of that world
; and
so, however clear
an
idea one may, by
reasoning,
derive of himself,
/>.,
of his soul, as a
spirit,
still, this idea
is with no man an
object of actual sight and experience.
This
difference,
however,
in
the
nature
of
spiritual
ideas and those belonging
to the body-life of man must
not be considered so great an obstacle
as
to remove all
possibility
of
becoming,
sometimes,
conscious
of
the
influences
of
the
spirit-world
even
in
this
life.
For
spiritual ideas can pass over into the personal conscious-
ness of man, indeed, not immediately, but
still
in
such
a way
that, according
to
the law
of the association
of
ideas, they
stir up
those
pictures which
are
related
to
them and awake analogous ideas of our senses.
These,
it
is true, would not be
spiritual conceptions themselves,
but yet their symbols.^-
n For, after
all,
it
is one and the
same substance which
is
a member both of this world
and
the
other, and
both kinds
of ideas
belong
to
the
same subject and are connected with each other.
How
this
is possible can be made
intelligible by considering
how our
higher conceptions
of reason, which approach
the spiritual
pretty
closely, ordinarily assume, as
it were,
a bodily garment to make themselves
clear, ^"^
Thence
it
is that the moral c|ualilics of deity are represented by the
ideas
of
anger,
jealousy,
mercifulness,
revenge,'"
&c.;
for the same reason poets personify the virtues, vices, and
other qualities of human
nature, though
this
is done in
such
a way
that
the
true
idea
of
the meaning
shines
through
;
in
the same way

time by a line, although time and space have comformity
only by relation and therefore agree, indeed, according to
analogy,
but
never
according
to
quality.
This
is
the
reason why the idea of divine eternity assumes even with
philosophers
the appearance
of
infinite
time,^' be they
never
so
careful
not
to
mix them up
;
and one
great
cause why mathematicians
are generally loath
to admit
the monads of Leibnitz may be
that they cannot help
but imagine these monads as little masses.
Thus it
is not
improbable
that
spiritual sensations can
pass over
into
consciousness
if they
act upon
correlated
ideas of the
senses.
In such
a way
ideas which
are communicated
by
spiritual
influx,
would
clothe
themselves
with
the
signs
of
that
language
which man
uses
for
his
other
purposes.
Thus the sensation of the presence of a spirit
becomes converted into the picture of the human figure
the
order
and
beauty
of
the
immaterial
world
into
fantasies which, under other circumstances, give pleasure
to our senses in this
life,^^ &c.
Nevertheless
this
kind
of
apparition
cannot
be
a
common and
ordinary
thing
but
can
occur only
with
persons whose organs* have an unusual sensitiveness for
intensifying,

it is called,

is wont
to accompany

a higher degree than is usually the case, and should be the
case,
with
healthy
persons.
Such
abnormal
persons
would
be
confronted,
in
certain
moments,
with
the
appearance
of many
objects
as
if they were outside of
themselves.
They
would
think
that
spiritual
natures
present
with
them
were
affecting
their
bodily
senses,
while
yet
this
is
only
a
delusion
of
the
imagination,
occurring, however, in such a way that
its cause
is a true
spiritual influence, not, indeed, perceivable immediately,
but revealing itself to consciousness by correlated pictures
of the
imagination
which
assume
the
appearance
of
sensations.
Conceptions
derived
from education and
all
sorts
of
fancies that have crept into the mind would exercise their
influence
here, where delusion
is mingled
with
truth,
a
real spiritual sensation being, indeed, the foundation, but
converted
into
phantoms
of
sensuous
things.
It
will
further be admitted that
the power
to
thus develop the
impressions of the spirit-world
into
the
clear perception
of this world can hardly be of any use, because in such a
process
the
spiritual
sensation
becomes
necessarily
so
closely interwoven with the fancies of the imagination that
it cannot be possible to distinguish the truth from the gross
surrounding
delusions.
Such
a
state
would
likewise
indicate
a
disease,
because
it
presupposes an
altered
balance
of
the
nerves,
which
are
put
into
unnatural
motion merely by the activity of purely spiritual sensations
of the
soul.
Finally,
it would
not be
at
all
strange
to
find the spirit-seer
to be at
the same time a dreamer, at

least in regard to the mental pictures which he makes
of
his visions
; because ideas, unknown to him by their very
nature and incompatible with those of his
bodily
state,
crowd in and drag into external sensation badly adjusted
pictures,
creating
thereby
wild chimeras and curiously
distorted figures, which
float
in
trailing garments
before
the senses, deceiving them in spite of the
fact that such
chimeras may be based upon a true spiritual influence.-^''
Now we need no longer be at a loss to give apparently
rational causes for the stories about apparitions which so
often
cross
the
path
of
philosophers,
as
well
as
to
account
for
all
sorts of influences from
spirits of wh'ich
the rumour goes here and there.^"^
Departed
souls and
pure spirits can indeed never be present
to our external
senses, nor communicate with
matter
in any other way
than by acting upon the
spirit of man, who belongs with
them
to
one
great
republic.
The
spirits
must
act
in
such a way that the
ideas which they call up
in man's
mind clothe themselves in corresponding pictures accord-
ing to the law of imagination, thus causing any objects
which
fit
into
the
picture
to appear
as
if
they
were
outside
of him.
This deception can
affect any one of
the
senses, and, however mixed
it may be
with incon-
gruous
fancies,
it should
not keep one from supposing
spiritual
influences
in
it.
I should encroach upon
the
penetration of the reader if
I should stop
to apply this
mode of explanation.

possessed of such an immense
flexibility that one must
be very awkward not

also,
to
a certain degree, for the

a

to be
like

that

propositions

made,
the
knowledge 4Df the other world can be obtained here only
by
losing some
of

I am
not
sure
if even

their metaphysical telescopes

ANTIKABALA.
A FRAGMENT OF COMMON PHILOSOPHY AIMING TO ABOLISH
COMMUNION WITH THE SPIRIT-WORLD.
Aristotle
says, somewhere,
" When we are awake, we
have a common
world,
but when we dream, everybody
has
his
own."
It
seems
to me
that
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
reverse
this
latter
proposition and
say,
if,
among
different human
beings,
every one has
his own
world,
it may be supposed that they dream.
With this
understanding we will view the various imaginary worlds
of these
air-architects which
each one
inhabits
quietly
to the exclusion of
others.
Behold,
for example, him
who
inhabits
the Order of Things as
it was framed by
AVolf out
of but
little
building
material obtained from
experience, but many conceptions gotten on the sly.
Or
we
will view those who inhabit the world produced by
Crusius
out
of
nothing,
by
means
of
a
few
magical
sayings about the thinkable and the unthinkable.
And,
as we
find
that
their
visions are
contradictory, we
will
patiently wait until the gentlemen have finished dream-
ing.
For
if, at some time, by the will of God, they wake
up,
i.e., open their eyes to such a view as does not exclude
conformity with other people's common sense, then none

75
of them
will sec anything that does not appear evident
and certain in the light of their proofs to others also, and
the philosophers
will then
inhabit a common world, of
the kind which
mathematicians
have
already occupied
for
a
long
time.
And
this
event
cannot
be
delayed
much
longer,
if certain signs and
predictions, which for
some time have appeared over the horizon of science, can
be trusted.
Reason-dreamers have a certain relation with sensation-
dreamers, among whom are usually counted those who
occasionally
deal with
spirits.
The reason
is that they
too,
like
the
former,
see
something
which
no
other
healthy
man
sees,
and
have
a
communication
of
their own with beings which reveal themselves to nobody
else, however keen
the
others'
senses may
be.
If one
supposes
that
the above-named
apparitions
rest
upon
mere
fancies, the term
" dreams " then becomes appro-
priate
to
them
in
so
far
as
both
are
self-created
pictures which nevertheless deceive the senses as
if they
were true
objects.
But
if one imagines both
kinds
of
deception to be so similar in
their origin that the source
of the one
will be found
sufficient
for the other, he
is
greatly deceived.
The man who, while awake, becomes
so absorbed
in the
foncies and chimeras
created by his
ever active imagination as
to pay
little attention to
the
sensations
of
the
senses
with
which
he
is
mostly
concerned
at
that
moment,
is
justly
called
a waking
dreamer.
For the sensations of the senses need decrease
only a little more in their intensity, and he will be asleep,
c

76
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
and
his chimeras will then be true dreams.
The reason
why they are no dreams while the dreamer pursues them
awake,
is,
because he then
perceives
the dreams as
in
himself, but other objects
as
outside
of himself ; conse-
quently he considers the dreams
as
effects
of
his own
activity,
but
the
perception
of
objects
as
part
of
his
received
impressions
from
the
outside.
For
in
this
situation
everything
depends upon
the
relation
which
man assumes the objects
to have
to himself as a man,
and,
consequently,
also
to
his body.
Thus,
the same
pictures can indeed occupy him very much in his waking
state, but they cannot deceive him, however
clear they
may
be.
For
although
he
has
then,
too,
in
his
brain
a
fictitious
impression
of himself and
his body,
which
he
puts
in
relation
to
his
fantastic
pictures,
nevertheless the real sensation of his body, by means of
the
external
senses,
establishes
a
contrast
with
those
chimeras,
or distinction from them, which goes to show
the ones as self-created,
the
other as perceived.'*^
If he
falls asleep, the idea of his body derived from impressions
disappears,
and
only
the
fictitious
idea
remains.
In
relation
to
this
latter
idea,
the
other chimeras are now
assumed to be outside of himself, and they are found to
deceive the dreamer as long as he sleeps, because there
is no sensation present which would furnish a basis for a
comparison
of the
two whereby
the
original
could be
distinguished from
the phantasm,
i.e,
the
outside
from
the inside.
The
spirit-seers,
therefore,
are entirely
different from

ANTIKABALA.
77
waking dreamers not
only
in degree, but
in
kind.
For
while
they
are
waking,
and
often
while
they
are
experiencing
other
sensations
with
great
vividness,
the
spirit-seers
place
some
imagined
things
among
the
external
objects which
they
really
perceive.
The only
question
is,
how
it
is
possible
that
they
place
the
phantoms of their imagination outside of themselves, and
even put them in relation to their body, which they sense
through
their
external
senses.
The
great
clearness
of
the fantasy cannot be the cause, for the point at issue
is,
the
place
where
an
object
is
put
;
and,
therefore,
I
demand
that
it
be shown how the
soul
places such an
image as
it should perceive to be contained in itself, into
an entirely different relation, namely, into a place outside
of itself and among those objects which are offered
to
its
real
perception.
I
shall
not
be
satisfied
with
the
quotation
of other cases which
bear some resemblance
with this deception, such as perhaps occur in the state of
fever
;
for be the deceived
well
or sick, we do not want
to know // such a thing happens also elsewhere, but hmv
this deception
is possible.
Wc
find,
however,
in
using our
external
senses,
that
besides the clearness with which the objects are seen, we
perceive
at
the same
time
their
location,
perhaps
not
always
with
the
same
accuracy,
still
as
a
necessary
condition
of
sensation,
without
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
perceive
things
as
being
outside of
our-
selves.*^
Here
it becomes quite probable that our soul
locates
the
perceived
object
at
that
point
where
the

78
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
different
lines, indicating the direction of the impression,
meet.
That
is why we
see
a
radiating
point
at
the
meeting-place of those lines which we draw from the eye
back
in the direction of the rays.
This point, which we
call
the
point of vision,
is,
in
its
effect,
the
scattering
point,
but,
in
the way
it
is
perceived,
it
is
the
point
which
collects
the
lines
of
direction
determining
the
sensation (focus imaginarius).
Thus we locate a visible
object even with one eye alone
;
in the same way as, by
means of a concave
mirror,
the image
of an
object
is
seen in the air
just in that spot where the rays radiating
from one
point of the object meet
before entering the
eye.*
The
same
theory,
perhaps,
can
be
applied
to
the
impressions of sound, because
its shocks, too, are trans-
mitted
in straight
lines.
Then we should
say that
the
sensation of sound
is accompanied by the perception of
a focus imaginarius, and that
this
is placed
in that point
where
the
straight
lines meet which
are drawn
to the
outside from
the vibrating
nerve-structure
inside of the
brain.
For the place and
distance of a sounding object
* This is the way in which optics usually represent the process of
locating an object, and
it agrees very well with experience.
But the
same rays which diverge from a point, are, on account of the refrac-
tion in the moistures of the eye, not thrown on the retina as divergent
rays, but
are there united into one
point.
If the sensation occurs
only
in
this nerve,
the
focus
imaginarius
would,
in consequence,
have to be placed not outside of the body, but in the background of
the
eye
itself.
This
creates a
difficulty which
I
cannot
solve
at
present,
and
which
seems
incompatible
with
the
above-named
propositions, as well as with experience.

is perceived to some extent, even
if the sound
is low and
comes from the back, and although the lines drawn from
such a position do not
strike the opening of the ear, but
other places of the head.
This makes one
believe that
the
soul
continues
the
lines
of vibration
externally
in
imagination,
and
places
the
sounding
object
in
their
meeting-point.'*-
The
same
can,
in my
opinion,
be
predicated of the other three senses, differing from sight
and hearing
in this respect that
the object of sensation
is in immediate
contact with
the organs of these
other
senses, and the lines indicating the place of the organic
stimulus find in the organs themselves their meeting-point.
In applying
this" to the pictures of imagination, permi^
me to take as basis the hypothesis of Cartesius, approved
of
by
most
of
the
philosophers
after
him,
• that
all
representations
of the imagination
are accompanied by
certain movements
in
the nerve-tissue
or nerve-spirit of
the brain, which movements are called "ideae mateiiales"';
i.e.,
these
representations
are, perhaps, accompanied
by
the concussion or vibration of the
fine element secreted
by these
nerve-tissues.
This vibration
is
similar
to the
movements which
the
sense-impression
might
produce,
and of which
the ncrvc-vibration
is a copy.
13ut now
I
must ask that
if
it be granted that the principal difference
between
the
nerve-movements
in
fantasies,
and
in
sensations, consists
in
the
fact
that, with
fantasies,
the
lines
indicating
the
direction
of
the
movement
meet
inside of the brain, while in sensation they meet outside
;
then, since the focus imaginarius in which the objects are

8o
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
perceived
in the clear sensations
of the waking
state
is
placed
outside
of myself, but
the
focus imaginarius
of
the fantasies entertained during the same state is placed
inside of myself,
I cannot
fail, as long as
I am awake, to
distinguish from the sense-impressions these imaginations
as fantasies.
If so much is admitted, it seems to me that I can adduce
some reasonable cause for that kind of mind-disturbance
called
insanity, and, in
its
higher
degree,
trance.
The
peculiarity of this disease is that the confused individual
places mere objects of his imagination outside of himself,
and
considers
them
to
be
real
and
present
objects.
Now I have
stated
that, according to the common order
of things,
the lines indicating the direction of the move-
ment, and accompanying
the
fantasies
in
the
brain
as
their material auxiliaries, must meet inside the brain, and
that,
consequently,
the
location
of
the
picture
in
the
subject's
consciousness
in
the
waking
state
must
be
placed inside of himself.
If,
therefore,
I suppose that,
by any accident
or
disease,
certain organs of the brain
are
distorted
or
thrown
out
of
their
equilibrium
in
such
a
manner
that
the
nerve
movements,
vibrating
harmoniously with
certain
fantasies, occur according
to
such lines of direction
as, continued, would meet outside
of the brain, then the focus imaginarius would be placed
outside of the thinking subject,* and the image produced

by mere
imagination would be
perceived
as an
object
present to the external
senses.
Though such a phantom
be only weak
at
the beginning, the consternation
at the
appearance of a thing which ought not to be there accord-
ing
to the natural order of things, will soon arouse atten-
tion, and
will
give
to
the phantom
sensation
such
a
vividness that the deluded person cannot doubt its reality.
This delusion can
affect any one of the external senses,
for of each we have copied images in imagination, and the
contortion of nerve-tissue can cause the focus imaginarius
to be placed
in that spot, whence the organic impression
of a really existing
bodily object would come.
It
is not
astonishing,
then,
if
the
visionary
believes
to
see
or
hear many a thing which nobody perceives besides him,
or if these fancies appear to him and disappear suddenly,
or
if they beguile the sense of vision,
for example, and
can be apprehended by no other sense
(if they cannot
be
felt,
for
instance),
and
thus
seem
to
him
so that their continuation may meet in the point where the object
is.
Similarly, a distortion of brain fibres, perhaps only temporary, and,
while
it
lasts,
affecting
only
a
few
nerves, may
occasion
certain
fantasies of imagination to appear to be outside of ourselves even in
the waking
slate.
A very common experience may be compared
with
this deception.
After
having
slept, we
often
regard—with
drowsy and
half-opened
eyes—the
variegated
threads of the bed-
curtains, or of the covering, or
the small
spots of the nearest wall,
an<l
easily
form
out
of them
figures
of human
faces and
similar
things.
The
delusion
ccxses
at
will and
as soon as attcnti<m
is
aroused.
In
this
case
the transfer of the
focus
imaginarius of the
fantasies
is, to some
extent, subject
to our
discretion, while
in
the
trance
it cannot be controlled by any will power.

intangible.
The common ghost-stories depend so much
on such
indications as these that they
easily justify the
suspicion
of hailing from such a
source.
In
the same
way the current conception of spiritual beings which we
evolved out of common phraseology,
is very much of the
nature
of
this
delusion, and does
not
belie
its
origin,
since the quality of an intangible presence in space is said
to constitute the essential characteristic of this conception.
It
is
further very probable
that
the
idea
of spectres,
imbibed from education, furnishes the head of a diseased
person with
materials
for deluding apparitions, and that
a brain
free from
all such
prejudices would not so soon
hatch
out
phantasms
of
this
kind,
even
though some
aberration might
befall
it.
Furthermore, as the disease
of the visionary concerns
not
so much
the
reason, as a
deception of the senses,
it
will be
easily recognized that
the unfortunate subject cannot remove
the
delusion by
any reasoning
;
for a
true
or apparent impression of the
senses
precedes
all
the judgments
of
the reason, and
carries with
it immediate evidence, far excelling all other
persuasion.
^-^
The consequence
resulting from
all
these
considera-
tions
is
in
so
far
inconvenient,
as
it
renders
entirely
superfluous
the
deep
conjectures
of
the
preceding
chapter
; and the
reader, though he was ready to receive
with some approval its idealistic notions, will nevertheless
prefer that conception which
allows of more comfort and
brevity in judging, and which
promises to find the more
general approval.
For, aside from
the
fact that
it seems

83
to conform more with a reasonable frame of mind to find
the means
of explanation
in
the
material
furnished
by
experience, than
to
lose
one's
self in the dizzy concep-
tions
of a
reason,
partly
inventing,
partly
jumping
at
conclusions, there
is always found, in such speculations,
occasion
for
scoffing, than
which, whether justifiable or
not,
there
is
no
stronger means
of keeping
back
idle
investigation.
For
it creates at once grave suspicion for
one
to
attempt
seriously
to expound
the
fancies
of a
visionary, and the kind of philosophy which
is found
in
such bad company is open to question.
It is true,
I have,
in
the
preceding,
not
contested
the
insanity
of
such
apparitions.
Rather, while
I have not made insanity to
be the cause
of an imagined communion
with
spirits,
I
have
yet connected
the
two by considering
insanity as
the natural consequence of such communion.
But what
foolishness
is there which could not be harmonized with
a
bottomless
philosophy ?
Therefore,
I
do
not
at
all
blame the
reader,
if, instead of regarding the
spirit-seers
as
half-dwellers
in
another
world,
he,
without
further
ceremony, despatches them as candidates for the hospital,
and
thereby
spares
himself
any
further
investigation,
liut,
if everything then
is to be treated on such a basis,
the manner
of handling such adej)ls
of the
spirit-world
must be very
dilferent from
that
based upon the ideas
given above
; and
if, formerly,
it was found
necessary at
times
to burn some
of them,
it now will
suffice
to give
them a purgative.
Indeed, from this point of view, there
was no need
of going
so
far back as to metaphysics,-

FOURTH
CHAPTER.
THEORETICAL CONCLUSION FROM THE WHOLE OF THE
CONSIDERATIONS OF THE KIKsr TARI.
The inaccuracy of scales used for commercial measure-
ments, according to civil law,
is discovered,
if we
let
the
merchandise
and
the
weights
exchange
pans.
So the
partiality of the scales of reason
is revealed by
the same
trick,
without
which,
in
philosophical
judgments,
no
harmonious
result can be obtained from
the compared
weighings.
I
have
purified
my
soul
from
prejudices,
I have destroyed any blind affection which ever crept
in
to procure in me an entrance for much fancied knowledge.
I now have nothing at heart
;
nothing is venerable to me
but what enters by the path of sincerity into a quiet mind
open
to
all
reasons—be
thereby my
former judgment
confirmed or abolished, be
I convinced or
left
in
doubt.
Wherever
I meet with something instructive, I appropriate
it.
The judgment of him who refutes my reasons,
is my
judgment, after
1
first have weighed
it
against
the
scale
of
self-love,
and,
afterwards,
in
that
.scale
against my
presumed
reasons, and have found
it
to have
a higher
intrinsic
value.
Formerly,
I
viewed
human
common
sense only from
the standpoint
of my own
;
now
I
put
myself
into
the
position of a
foreign
reason
outside of

86
DREAMS OF A SPIKIT-SEER.
myself, and observe my judgments,
together with
their
most secret causes, from the point of view of others.
It
is
true,
the
comparison
of
both
observations
results
in
pronounced
parallaxes,
but
it
is
the
only
means
of
preventing
the
optical
delusion,
and
of
putting
conceptions
in
regard
to
the
power
of knowledge
in
human nature into their
true places.
You may say that
this
is very serious
talk
in connection with so
trifling a
problem as
that under
consideration, which deserves
to
be called a
plaything
rather than a
serious occupation,
and you
are
not
exactly wrong
in thus judging.
But
although one ought
not
to make a great ado about a
small
matter, yet one may perhaps be allowed to make
use of such occasions
;
and unnecessary circumspection
in
small
matters
may
furnish
useful
example
in
important matters.
I
find no attachment nor any other
inclination to have
crept in before examination, so as to
deprive my mind of a readiness to be guided by any kind
of reason pro or
con, except
one.
The
scale of reason
after
all
is
not
quite
impartial,
and one
of
its
arms,
bearing
the
inscription,
" Hope
of
the
Future,"
has
a
constructive
advantage,
causing
even
those
light
reasons which fall into
its scale to outweigh the specula-
tions of greater weight on the other
side.
This
is the
only
inaccuracy
which
I
cannot
easily
remove,
and
which,
in
fact,
I
never
want
to
remove.
I
confess
that
all
stories about
apparitions
of departed
souls
or
about
influences from
spirits, and
all theories about the
presumptive nature of
spirits and
their connection with

87
us, seem to have appreciable weight only
in the scale of
hope,^^ while
in
the
scale
of speculation
they seem
to
consist of nothing but air.
If the answer to the problem
in question were not in sympathy with a prior inclination,
what reasonable man would be doubtful as to whether
it
were more plausible to assume the existence of a kind of
beings which have no
similarity whatever with anything
taught him by his
senses, or to attribute certain
alleged
experiences
to
a
kind
of
self-deception and
invention
which, under certain circumstances,
is by no means un-
common.
In fact this seems to be
in general the main reason for
crediting the ghost-stories so widely accepted.
Even the
first
delusions about presumed
apparitions of deceased
people have probably arisen from the fond hope that we
still
exist
in some way
after death.
And
then,
at
the
time of the shadows of night,
this illusion has probably
deluded
the
senses, and
created out
of doubtful
forms
phantoms corresponding
to preconceived
ideas.
From
these,
finally,
the
philosophers
have
taken occasion
to
devise the
rational
idea of
spirits, and
to
bring
it
into
a system.
You probably
will recognise also in my own
assumed doctrine of the communion of spirits this trend
to which people commonly incline.
For
its propositions
evidently unite only to give an idea how man's spirit leaves*
• The old
Efjyptians had as symbol
for the soul a butterfly, and
the Greek name sijjnities the same.
One can easily sec that the hope,
which makes death to be only a transformation, has caused such an
idea, together with
its symbol.
But
this does not at
all invalidate

88
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEEK.
this world, i.e.^ of the state after death.
But how
it enters,
i.e., of procreation and propagation,
I make no mention.
Nay,
I do
not even mention how
it
is present
in
this
world,
i.e.,
how
an
immaterial
nature
can
be
in
an
immaterial
body and
act by means of
it.*^
The very
good reason
for
all
this
is
that
I do not understand a
single thing about the whole matter, and, consequently,
might
as
well
have
been
content
to
remain
just
as
ignorant
as
before
in
regard
to
the
future
state,
had
not
the
partiality
of
a
pet
notion
recommended
the
reasons
which
offered
themselves,
however weak
they
were.
The same ignorance makes me so bold as to absolutely
deny the truth
of the various ghost
stories, and yet with
the common,
although
queer,
reservation
that while
I
doubt any one of them,
still
I have a certain faith in the
whole
of them
taken
together.
The
reader
is
free
to
judge as
far as
I am concerned.
The scales are
tipped
far enough on
the
side
containing
the
reasons
of the
second chapter to make me serious and undecided when
listening to the many strange tales of this kind.
But, as
reasons
to
justify one's self are never lacking when the
mind
is
prejudiced,
I do not want to
bother the reader
with any further defence of such a way of thinking.
As I am now at the conclusion of the theory of spirits,
the confidence that the conceptions thence evolved are right.
Our
inner
perception,
and
the
conchisions drawn
from
it,
being
like
reason, bring us,
if they remain uncorrupted, to that point to which
reason
itself would
lead us
if
it were more enlightened, and
of a
greater scope.*^

THEORETICAL
CONCLUSION.
89
I am bold enough to say that this study,
if properly used
by the reader, exhausts all philosophical knowledge about
such
beings, and
that
in
future,
perhaps, many
things
may be thought about
it, but never more known.
This
assumption
sounds
rather
vainglorious.
P"or
of
such
multifariousness
are
the problems
offered by nature, in
its smallest
parts, to a reason so
limited
as
the human,
that
there
is certainly no object of nature known
to the
senses,
be
it only a drop of water or a
grain
of sand,
which ever could be said to be exhausted by observation
or
reason.
But
the
case
is
entirely
different
with
the
philosophical conception of spiritual beings.
It may be
complete,
but
in
the
negative
sense,
by
fixing
with
assurance
the
limits of our knowledge, and convincing
us
that
all
that
is granted
to us
is
to know the
diverse
manifestations of life in nature and its laws
;
but that the
principle of this life,
i.e., the unknown and only assumed
spiritual
nature, can
never be thought
of
in a
positive
way, because
for
this purpose no data can be found
in
the whole of our sen.sations
;
that
therefore we have to
resort to negations for the sake of thinking something so
entirely different from everything sensuous
; but
that the
possibility of such
negations
rests
likewise neither upon
experience nor ujjon conclusions,
but upon invention, to
which a
reason
deprived
of
all other expedients
finally
resorts.
With
this
understanding
pneumatology
may
be
called
a
doctrinal
conception
of
man's
necessary
ignorance in regard to a supposed kind of beings, and as
such
it can easily be adequate to
its task.

DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
And now
I
lay aside
this whole
matter
of
spirits,
a
remote part of metaphysics,
since
I
have
finished and
am done with it.*^
In future
it does not concern me any
more.
By thus making the plan of my investigation more
concentrated, and
sparing myself some
entirely
useless
inquiries,
I hope to be able to apply to better advantage
my
small
reasoning power upon other
subjects.
It
is
generally vain to try to extend the
little strength one has
over
a
wide
range
of
undertakings.
It
is
therefore a
matter of policy, in this as other cases,
to
fit the pattern
of one's plans to one's powers, and
if one cannot obtain
the great, to restrict one's self to the mediocre.

Philcsophy,
which

finds
itself often in awkward embarrassment in view of certain
stories, parts of which
it cannot doubt without

nor

Both
difficulties we
find

a

Not
that

are
entirely
free
from
any

in
the

referred
to,
but
because

rightly shuts out questions raised either by presumption
or vain
curiosity.
Thus
stories of this kind will have at
any time
only
secret
believers, while
publicly
they
are
rejected by the prevalent fashion of disbelief.
Meanwhile, as
this whole question seems to me to be
neither important enough nor well enough studied out to
be
finally pronounced upon,
I do not hesitate to
relate
here some information
of the
kind mentioned, and
to
submit
it
with
absolute
indifference
to
the
kind
or
unkind judgment of the
reader.
There
lives at Stockholm a
certain
Mr. Swedenborg,
a
gentleman
of
comfortable
means
and
independent
position.
His whole occupation
for more than twenty
years
is,
as he himself says,
to be in closest intercourse
with
spirits and deceased
souls
;
to
receive news from
the other world,
and,
in exchange,
give those who are
there
tidings
from
the
present
;
to
write
big volumes
about his discoveries
: and to travel at times to London
to
look
after
their
publication.
He
is
not
especially
reticent about
his
secrets,
talks
freely about them with
everybody,
seems
to
be
entirely
convinced
of
his
pretensions,
and
all
this
without any
apparent
deceit
or charlatanry.
Just as
he,
if we may
believe him,
is

.4 STORV.
93
the Arch-Spiritseer among all the spiritseers, he certainly
is
also
the
Arch- Dreamer
among
all
the
dreamers,
whether
we
judge
him
by
the
description
of
those
who
know
him,
or
by
his
works.
But
this
will
not
hinder those who, otherwise, are favourable to influences
from spirits, from supposing that there is some truth back
of
such
phantasms.
Still,
as
the
credentials
of
all
plenipotentiaries
from
the
other
world
consist
in
the
proofs** which, by certain tests, they give of their calling
in the
present
world,
I must quote from what
is spread
abroad to authenticate the extraordinarj' capacities of the
above-mentioned
gentleman
at
least
that
which,
with
most
people,
still
finds some
credit.
Towards
the end of the
year
1761, Mr. Swedenborg
was
called
to
a
princess, whose great
intelligence and
insight ought to render deception
of such a nature im-
possible.
The call was occasioned by the common report
about
the
pretended
visions
of
this man.
After some
questions
which
were
intended
to amuse
her
with
his
illusions, the princess dismissed him, after having charged
him with a secret mission concerning his communication
with
spirits.
Several
days
afterwards,
Mr. Swedenborg
appeared with an answer which was of such a nature
as
to create in the princess, according to her own confession,
the
liveliest astonishment,
for the answer was
true, and
at the same time, could not have been given
to him by
any living human being.
This
story
is drawn
from
the
report sent by an ambassador at the court there, who was
present
at
that
time,
to another
foreign ambassador
in

94
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
Copenhagen
;
it exactly agreed also with
all
that
special
inquiry has been able to learn.
The following stories have no other proof than common
report,
which
is
rather
doubtful
evidence.
Madame
Marteville, the widow of a Dutch envoy
at the Swedish
court, was reminded by a goldsmith to pay some
arrears
due on a silver-service furnished her.
The lady, knowing
the economy
of her deceased husband, was convinced
that this debt must have been settled already
in
his
life-
time, but she found no proof whatever among the papers
he left.
Woman
is especially prone to credit the
stories
of
soothsaying,
interpretation
of
dreams,
and
similar
wonderful things.
The widow
discovered
therefore her
trouble
to
Mr.
Swedenborg,
requesting him
to procure
from her husband in the
other world information about
the real facts of the claim— if it v.ere true, as people
said
of him,
that
he had intercourse with deceased
people.
Mr.
Swedenborg
promised
to do
it,
and,
a
few
days
afterwards, reported to the lady in her house, that he had
obtained the desired information, and
that the
requisite
receipts were in a hidden partition of a
closet which he
showed
to
her,
and
which,
in
her
opinion, had been
entirely emptied.
A search was made at once, according
to
his
description, and,
together with
the
secret Dutch
correspondence,
the
receipts
were
found, making void
all claims.
The third
story
is of a kind of which
it must be very
easy to completely prove either the truth or the untruth.
It was,
if
I am
rightly informed, towards the end of the

A STORY.
95
year 1759, when one afternoon Mr. Swedenborg, coming
from
England,
landed
in
Gothenburg.
The
same
evening he was invited
to meet some company at the
house
of
a
resident
merchant.
After
being
present a
short
while he proclaimed,
with
evident
consternation,
the news
that, just
at
that moment, a
terrible
fire was
raging
in
Stockholm,
in
the
Sudermalm.
After
the
lapse of several hours, during which he had from time to
time left the company, he reported
to them
that the fire
was checked, and how far
it had spread.
This wonderful
news was noised abroad
the same evening, and the next
morning
was
all
over
the
town.
Not
until
two
days
after
did
the
first
report
from
Stockholm
arrive
in
(iothenburg.
It agreed entirely,
it
is said, with Sweden-
borg's visions.**^
It will
probably be asked what on
earth could have
moved me to engage in such a contemptible business as
that of circulating stories to which a rational man hesitates
patiently to
listen
;
nay, that
I should even make them
the subject of a philosophical investigation.
But as the
philosophy which we
prefixed
was
equally
a
tale from
the
Utopia
of
metaphysics,
I
do
not
see
anything
unseemly
in
letting
both
appear
together.
Anyhow,
why
should
it
be
more
creditable
to
be
deceived
by
blind
confidence
in
the
pretences
of
reason
than
by
incautious belief
in misleading stories ?
The
borders
of
folly
and
wisdom
are
marked
so
indistinctly
that one can
hardly
walk
long
in
the one
region
without
making
at times a
little digression
into

96

the
other.
But
so
far
as
that
sense
of
honour
is
concerned,
which
may
sometimes
be
persuaded
even
against resisting
reason,
it seems to be a remnant of the
old ancestral
loyalty which, to be
sure, does not exactly
fit in with the present state of things, and therefore often
becomes
folly,
yet,
on
that
account,
is
not
to
be
considered the natural heirloom of stupidity.
I
leave
it,
therefore, to
the
discretion
of the
reader
to reduce the
queer
story
with
which
I am
meddling,—a
doubtful
mixture of reason and
credulity,—into
its components,
and
to
make
out
what
are
the
proportions
of
both
ingredients in my mind.
For, seeing that the main point
in such a criticism
is
to preserve proper decorum,
I am
sufficiently guarded against ridicule by the
fact that with
this
folly,
if you want
to
call
it by
that name,
I am in
quite
good
and
numerous
company,
and
this,
as
Fontenelle believes,
is alone sufficient at
least to prevent
one's being regarded as unwise.
For
it always has been,
and,
probably,
always
will
be
the
case,
that
certain
nonsensical
things
are accepted
even
by
rational men,
just because they
are generally talked about.
To
that
class belong sympathetic healings, the wand, forebodings,
the
effect
of the
imagination
of
pregnant women,
the
influences
of
the
changing
moon
upon
animals
and
plants,
«S:c.
Yea,
a
short

the

The
weakness
of
man's
reason,
together with
his
curiosity,
brings
it about
that,
in the
beginning,
truth
and
deceit
are
snatched
up
promis-
cuously.
But, gradually, the ideas are purified
; a small
part remains, the rest
is thrown away as offal.

to

these

stories
seem
to
be
of
importance,
if he has money enough and nothing
better
to do, may, at any
rate, make a journey
for the sake of
more accurate information, just as Artemidor travelled in
Asia Minor to satisfy himself about the interpretation of
dreams.
Posterity of the same turn of mind will be very
grateful
to him
for making
it
impossible
for a second

SECOND
CHAPTER.
A dreamer's ecstatic journey through the world
OF
spirits.
Somnia, tcrrores magicos, miracula, sagas,
Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala.
Horace.
I cannot take
it as in any way amiss
in the cautious
reader,
if, during the development of this work, he should
have grown
doubtful
about
the manner
of proceeding
adopted by the author.
For,
as
I
treated the dogmatic
part
before
the
historic,
and
thus
set
reasons
before
experience,
I gave cause for the suspicion
of underhand-
dealing, by having the whole thing before my mind from
the start, and then feigning to know nothing but abstract
considerations, so that
I might finally surprise the reader
who
is expecting no such
thing, by a pleasing confirma-
tion
from
experience.
In
fact,
this
is
a
trick
which
philosophers have used at
several
times with
very good
success.
To
wit,
all knowledge has two ends
of which
you can take hold, the one a priori, the other a posteriori.
It is true, several modern
scientists have pretended
that
one must, of necessity, begin
at the
latter.
They think
they can catch the eel of science at the
tail, by
first
pro-
curing enough knowledges
from
experience,
and
then

ascending gradually
to general and higher conceptions.
But although this may not be unwise, it is not nearlyleamed
enough,
nor
philosophical.
For
in
this
manner
one
soon arrives at a why which cannot be answered, and that
is
just
as
creditable
for
a
philosopher
as
it
is
for a
merchant to pleasantly ask one to come some other time
when a bill of exchange
is presented to him for payment.
To avoid
this inconvenience acute men have begun at
the
opposite
farthest
border,
the
outmost
point
of
metaphysics.
But
a
new
difficulty
is
here
incurred,
of beginning
I don't know where, and of coming I don't
know whither
;
also that the reasoning, when continued,
does not seem to
fall in with experience
;
yea, it seems as
if the atoms of Epicurus, after having
fallen and
fallen
from
eternity, might sooner meet by chance some time
and
form
a
world, than
that common
ideas
will meet
and
exemplify
these
abstract
principles.
When
the
philosopher thus clearly saw
that his reasons on the one
hand
and
actual
experience
or
report
on
the
other
might, like two
parallel
lines,
run alongside each other
into
infinity
without
ever
meeting,
he
agreed
with
others, as by mutual consent, that each should take the
starting-point
in
his own way
; each then should guide
the
reason
not
by
the
straight
line
of
logic,
but
by
giving to the lines of evidence an imperceptible twist, and
so, by .stealthily squinting in
llic direction of certain exper-
iencies or testimonies, each one should bring the reason
to
the
point
of proving
just
what, unsuspected by
the
trustful pupil, he all the time had in mind as the experience

100

to be rationally proved.
Add
to
this
that they call this
road the road a priori, although they have imperceptibly
directed
it to the point a posteriori, by following a road
already staked out.
They do not tell you that, of course,
because it is only fair for the
initiated not
to betray the
tricks
of the
profession.
With
this
ingenious method
several men of merit have caught even secrets of religion
by pure reasoning
;
just as a novelist makes the heroine
flee into remote countries that there, by a lucky adventure,
she
haply may
meet
her
lover
;
" et
fugit ad
salices,
et se cupit ante videri."
(Virgil).
With such celebrated
predecessors,
I
need
not
have
been
ashamed
even
if
I
really had made
use
of
the
same
trick
to
help
my work to a good ending.
But
I
earnestly beg of the
reader not to believe
such
a
thing
of me.
Anyhow, of
what
use would
it
be
to me now when I can
deceive
nobody any more, having given away the secret ?
More-
over,
I undergo this misfortune, that the testimony which
I have stumbled
upon, and which resembles so uncom-
monly the philosophical creation
of my own brain, looks
desperately misshapen and
foolish, so that
I must rather
expect the reader
to
consider my reasons as absurd on
account of their relation to such confirmations, than that
he will consider these latter reasonable on account of my
reasons.
I
therefore
declare
without more ado
that in
regard to the alleged examples
I mean no
joke, and
I
declare once for all, that
either one has to suppose more
intelligence and
truth
to be in Swedenborg's works than
a
first
glance
will
reveal, or that
it
is only chance when

A DREAMER'S ECSTATIC JOURNEY.
lol
he coincides with my system
;
as
poets sometimes, when
they
are
raving,
are
beheved
to
prophesy,
or
at
least
profess
that
they
do, when, now and
then, events
bear
them out.
I come to the point, the works
of my hero.
If many
authors who are now
forgotten, or, at
least, in future will
be without fame, deserve no
small credit because, in the
composition
of
big
works,
they
took
no
heed
of
the
expenditure
of their
reason,
Mr. Swedenborg
doubtless
should
carry
highest
honours among them
all.
For,
surely, his bottle in the lunar world
is
quite
full, and
is
inferior to none among
all
those which Ariosto has seen
there, filled with the reason that was lost here, and which
the owners one day
will
have to seek again
; so
utterly
empty
of the
last
drop
of
reason
is
his
big
work.^°
Nevertheless, such
a wonderful agreement we find there
with what reason can obtain on the same
subject
by
the
most subtle investigations, that the reader will pardon me
if I discover here that rare play of imagination which
so
many other collectors have found
in the plays of nature,
when, for example, in spotted marble they make out the
Holy
Family, or
in stalactite
formations
they make out
monks, baptismal fonts, and church organs, or even as the
banterer Liscow discovered
on
the
frosted window-pane
the number
of the
beast and
the
triple
crown,
all
of
which nobody else sees
but he whose head is filled with
it beforehand.
The big work of
this author comprises
eight volumes
quarto full of nonsense.
He puts them before the world

I02
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
as a new revelation under the
title of "Arcana Coelestia,"
and applies therein his visions mostly to the discovery of
the hidden
sense
in the
first books of Moses, and
to a
similiar mode of explanation of the whole
of Scripture.
All
these
fantastic
interpretations
do not concern me
here, but, whoever desires
it, may look up
Dr. Ernesti's
Theological
Library, volume
first, for some information
about them.
Only
the " audita and
visa,"
i.e., what he
professes
to
have
seen
with
his own
eyes and
heard
with
his
own
ears,
we
will
extract,
principally
from
the
appendices
to
his
chapters,
because
they
are
the
foundation
of
all
the other
fancies, and
are
also
pretty
well
in
the same
line with
the adventure which, in
the
foregoing, we have undertaken
in
the balloon of meta-
physics.
The author's
style
is
plain.
His
stories and
their arrangement seem
really to be based upon fanatic
observation,
and
afford
little
reason
to
suspect
that
fancies of a wrongly speculating reason have moved him
to invent them, and use them
for deception.
In so
far
they
are
of
some
importance,
and
are
really
more
deserving of being presented
in a condensed form than
many a plaything of brainless reasoners which
swells our
quarterlies.
For a systematic delusion of the senses
is a
much more remarkable phenomenon than the deception
of reason, the causes of which are well enough known, and
which
mostly could be prevented by an effort
to guide
the powers of mind, and
to restrain somewhat an empty
inquisitiveness.
The delusion of the senses, on the other
hand,
concerns
the
first
foundation of
all judgments,

against
the
perversion
of which
the
rules of
logic have
little power.
I
distinguish,
therefore,
with
our
author,
between
delusions and
the deductions thence, and
pass
over his incorrect reasonings, the consequences of his not
stopping at his visions,—just as we often have to separate
in
a philosopher
that which
he observes from what he
reasons, and
just
as even
seeming experiences
are,
for
the
most
part, more
instructive
than seeming
reasons.
While thus robbing
the reader of some of the moments
which otherwise he might have put
to the study of the
exhaustive
discussion
of the
matter,
without,
however,
being much more
benefited,
I
have taken
care,
never-
theless, of his sensitive taste by leaving out many of the
wild chimeras of the book, and reducing
its quintessence
to a few drops.
I
expect
for that just as much
grateful-
ness from
the
reader,
as
a
certain
patient
believed he
owed
to his doctors because they made him eat only the
bark of cinchona, while they might easily have compelled
him to eat the whole tree.
Mr. Swedenborg
divides
his visions
into three
kinds.
In the
first kind he
is liberated from the body, in a state
mediate between sleeping and waking,
in which he has
seen,
heard, even
felt
spirits.
This he has experienced
only three or four times.
The second
is being led away
by the
spirit, when he may be out walking on the street
without
losing
himself, while
at the same time
his
spirit
is in
entirely different regions and sees clearly elsewhere
houses,
men,
forests,
&c., and
this
perhaps
for
several
hours, until he suddenly becomes aware again of his real

I04
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
place.
That happened to him two or three times.
The
third kind
of visions
is what
is
usual
with
him,
those
which
he has
daily while wide awake
;
and from these
visions
his stories are taken.
All men,
according
to
his
testimony,
are
in
equally
close
conjunction
with
the
spirit-world
;
most
men,
however,
do
not
perceive
it,
the
difference
between
himself and
others
consisting only
in the
fact
that
his
interiors
are
opened,
a
gift
of which
he
always speaks
with
reverence
(datum
mihi
est
ex
divina
Domini
misericordia).
It may be
seen
from
the
context
that
this gift is supposed to consist in the faculty of becoming
conscious of the obscure ideas which
one's soul receives
by
its
continual
connection with
the
spirit-world.
He
distinguishes
therefore
in man the outer and the inner
memory.
The former he has as a person belonging to
the
visible
world.
On
this
fact
also
the
distinction
between the outer and inner man
is founded
;
his own
privilege
consists
in
seeing
himself already
in
this
life
as
a
person
in
the company
of
spirits,
and
in
being
recognised
by them
as
man.*^
In
this
inner memory
everything
is preserved which has disappeared out of the
outer,—nothing of
all the perceptions of a man
is
ever
lost.
After death
the remembrance
of everything
that
ever entered his
soul,
also of what was formerly hidden
to himself, forms the complete book of his Hfe.*^
The presence of spirits,
it is true,
affects only his inner
sense.
But
this makes them appear
to him
as
being
outside of himself, and
in the form of the human figure.

^ DREAMER'S ECSTATIC JOURNEY.
105
The language of spirits
is an immediate communication
of ideas,
but
it
is always connected with the appearance
of that language which
the
observer
ordinarily
speaks,
and
is
represented
as
being
outside
of
himself.^^
A
spirit
reads
in
the memory of another
spirit
the
ideas
which are contained
in the inner memory with clearness.
Thus
the
spirits
see
in
Swedenborg
the
perceptions
which he has from
this world,
with such
clearness,
that
they
deceive
themselves,
and
often
imagine
they
perceive immediately those things which
it
is impossible
for them
to
see f^
for no
spirit has
the
least sensation
from the corporeal world.
Also, through communication
with the souls of other
living men,
they can
receive no
idea of this
world,
because
the
interior of such men
is
not opened,
and contains
only
ideas
entirely
obscure.
For
this
reason Swedenborg
is
the
very
oracle
of the
spirits,
who
are
just
as
curious
to
view
in
him
the
present
state of the world, as he
is curious
to observe
in
their memory,
as
in a
mirror,
the wonders of the
spirit-
world.
Although
these
spirits
are
also
in
the
closest
conjunction
with
the
souls
of
all other
men,
operating
upon them and being operated upon by them,
they yet
know this as
little as men know
it
; so entirely obscure is
that
interior
sense
which
belongs
to
the
spiritual
personality
of men.
The
spirits
therefore
believe
that
those things which have been
effected
in them through
the influence of the souls of men, have been thought by
tiiemselves
alone
;
just
as
men
in
this
life
think no
Otherwise, than
that
all
their thoughts and
inclinations

I06
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
come from themselves, although, as a matter of fact, they
often flow into them
out
of
the
other
world."
Each
human soul has already
in
this
life its place in the spirit-
world, and
belongs
to
a
society, always
in accordance
with
the inner
state of good and
truth,
/>., of will and
understanding. 2®
But the places of spirits among them-
selves
have
nothing
in common
with
space
in
the
corporeal world.
Thus the soul of a man
in
India can
be next to the soul of another man in Europe, as far as
their
spiritual
places are concerned,
while
those which,
according
to
the
body,
live
in
one
house,
may
be
spiritually very
far from one another.
When man dies,
the soul does not change
its
place,
but only
perceives
itself to be
in
that
place
which,
in
relation
to
other
spirits,
it occupied already in this
life.
But although the
relation
of
spirits among
themselves
is no
real
space,
it
has
still
with
them
the
appearance
of
it,*^ and
their
conjunctions
are
perceived
under
the
accessory
condition
of
nearness,
their
differences,
on
the
other
hand,
as
distances.
In
the
same
way
spirits
possess
no
extent,
but
yet
present
to
each
other
the appearance
of human
figures.
In
this
imaginary
space
there
exists
a
universal
community
of
spiritual
natures.
Swedenborg
talks with departed
souls
at
will,
and
reads
in
their memory (power
of perception)
that
state which they observe
in themselves, and sees
it just
as clearly as with bodily eyes.
Moreover, the enormous
distances
which
divide
the
rational
inhabitants
of
the
world are nothing in regard to the spiritual universe, and

// DREAMER'S ECSTATIC JOURNEY.
107
it
is
just
as easy
for one
to
talk
with an
inhabitant
of
Saturn,
as
with
a
deceased
human
soul.
Everything
depends on the condition of the interior state, and upon
the
conjunction
in
which
spirits
are
according
to
the
harmony
of
their
states
of good and
truth.
And
the
more remote
spirits can
easily
enter
into mutual com-
munication through the intermediation of others.
Thus
man does not need
to have actually dwelt
in the other
worlds
for the sake of knowing them some day with
all
their
wonders.
His
soul
reads
in
the memory
of the
deceased
citizens of other worlds the perceptions which
they
possess
about
their
life
and
dwelling-place,
and
thereby sees objects as
easily as by immediate observa-
tion."
A principal conception
in Swedenborg's phantasm
is
the following
:—Corporeal
beings have no substance of
their own,
but
exist only through
the
spirit-world,
not,
however,
that each body
exists
through one
spirit,
but
through
all taken
together.
For that reason
the know-
ledge
of
material
things
has
a double
significance, an
external
meaning
in
regard
to
the
inter-relations
of
matter,
an
internal
meaning
in
so
far
as
material
effects
indicate
the
powers
of
the
spirit-world
which
cause
them.
Thus
the
parts
in
the
body
of man
stand
in
relation
to
each
other
according
to
material
laws.
But
in
so
far
as
the
body
is
preserved
by
the
spirit
living
in
it,
its
various
members
and
their
functions
are
of
value
in
indicating
those
powers
of
the
soul
by
the
operation
of
which
they

have
their
form,
activity,
and
stability. ^^
xhis
inner
meaning
is unknown
to
man,
and
it
is
that
which
Swedenborg, whose
interiors
are opened, wants
to make
known to the world.
With all other things of the visible
world
the case is
the same
;
they have, as I
say, a signi-
fication as things, which amounts to little, and another as
signs, which amounts to much.°^
This also
is the origin
of
all
the new interpretations which he would make of
the
Scripture. ^°
For
this
inner
meaning,
the
internal
sense,
i.e., the symbolic
relation
of
all things
told
there
to
the
spirit-world,
is,
as he
fancies,
the
kernel
of
its
value, the rest only the shell.
Again, the important point
in
this
symbolic
conjunction
of
corporeal
things,
as
images, with
the
interior spiritual
state,
is the following.
All
spirits present themselves
to each other under the
appearance
of
figures
possessing
extent
;
and
the
in-
fluences of all these spiritual beings among each other at
the same
time
call
forth
the appearance of
still
other
spiritual creatures
possessing
extent, thus, as
it were, the
appearance of a material world.
The scenes of this world,
however, are only symbols of its inner state ; nevertheless
they cause such
a
clear and enduring deception of the
senses
as
to
equal
the
real
sensation
of such
objects.
(A future interpreter will conclude from this that Sweden-
borg was an
idealist, because he denies
to this world
its
independent subsistence, and therefore held
it to be only
a systematic appearance, arising from
the constitution of
the spirit world.)
Thus he talks about the gardens, vast
countries, the dwelling-places, galleries, and arcades of the

109
spirits, which he claims
to see with
his own eyes
in
the
clearest
light.
And he assures us
that, having spoken
after their death with all his friends, he had nearly always
found
that
those
having
died
recently could persuade
themselves
with
difficulty
that
they had
died,
because
they beheld a similar world
;
also, that societies of spirits
of the same
inner state
live
in the same appearance in
regard
to the country and other things there, and
that a
change of
state
is accompanied by
the appearance of a
change
of
locality.
The mass of wild and unspeakably
absurd forms and
figures which our dreamer
believes to
see quite clearly in
his daily intercourse with spirits must
be
derived
from
the
fact
that,
whenever
spirits com-
municate
their
thoughts
to
the
souls
of men,
these
thoughts take the appearance of material
things, which,
however, present
themselves
to
the subject
only on
the
strength of their relation
to an
inner meaning, but,
still,
with all appearance of reality.
I
have already
stated
that,
according
to our author,
the many powers and
qualities
of the
soul
are
in sym-
pathy with those organs of the body which they govern.
The whole outer man therefore corresponds to the whole
inner man.
If, then, a perceptible spiritual
influx from
the
invisible
world
flows
mainly
into some one of the
powers
of the
soul, he
harmoniously
feels
its apparent
presence
also
in
the
corresponding
member
of
his
outer man.
Under this head he classifies a great variety
of sensations
in
his body which
he
claims
are
always
connected
with
spiritual
contemplation.
But
their

foolishness
is too great
for me
to
dare
to quote even
one of them.
From
these
data,
if
it be
considered
worth
while,
one may now form a conception of that most extravagant
and queerest of fancies in which all his dreams culminate.
Just
as
various powers and
capacities form
that unity
which constitutes the soul or the inner man, in the same
way also various
spirits (whose
principal
traits have the
same
relation
to
each
other
as
the many
faculties
of
a
single
spirit have among themselves)
form a
society
which has
the appearance of a great
man.^7:36
j^ this
image each spirit
finds himself in that place and
in that
apparent member
which
is
in
accordance
with
his
peculiar
office
in
such
a
spiritual
body.
Again,
all
societies
of
spirits
together, and
the world of
all these
invisible
beings, finally presents itself in the appearance
of the Grand Man, Maximus Homo.^^
A colossal and
gigantic
fancy, which, perhaps, has grown out of an old
childish conception, just as
in schools sometimes, as an
aid
to memory, a whole
continent
is
pictured
to
the
pupils under the image of a
sitting
virgin, &c.
In
this
enormous man there
is a universal, most intimate com-
munion of one spirit with all others, and of all with one
;
and, whatever may be the
positions or changes of living
beings
in regard
to each other
in
this
world,
still each
has his place in the Grand Man entirely distinct from his
place
here, a place which he never changes, which
is in
immeasurable space only according to appearance, but in
reality signifies only a particular character of his relations
and influences.

A DREAMER'S ECSTATIC JOUKNEY.
iii
I am tired
of copying
the wild chimeras of this worst
of
all
dreamers, and
forbear
continuing
them
to
his
descriptions of the
state after death.
I
have
still other
scruples.
For, although a collector of objects of natural
history puts up in
his press among the prepared objects
of
animal
procreation
not
only
such
as
are
formed
naturally
but
also
abortions,
he
nevertheless
has
to be
careful
not
to show them too
plainly and not to every-
body.
For among
the
curious
there
might
easily
be
some pregnant persons who might
receive an
injurious
impression.
And
as among my readers some might be
just
as
likely
in an
interesting
condition
in
regard
to
spiritual
conceptions,
I
should
be
sorry
if
they
had
received a detrimental shock
by anything
I
have
told.
However, as
I have warned them right at the start,
I am
responsible
for
nothing, and
hope
not
to be burdened
with
the
moon-calves
which
their
fruitful
imagination
might bring forth on this occasion.
As
it
is,
I
have not
substituted my own
fancies
for
those
of
our
author,
but
have
offered
his views
in
a
faithful
extract
to
the comfortable and economic reader
who docs
not
care
to
sacrifice seven pounds
for a little
curiosity.
It
is true,
I have mostly avoided quoting the
visions
them.selves,
as such
wild
chimeras only
disturb
the sleep of the reader, and the confused meaning of his
revelations has been brought now and then
into some-
what
intelligible
language
;
but
the main
traits
of the
sketch
have thereby
not
suffered
in
accuracy.
Never-
theless,
it
is only
in
vain
that one would
hide
the
fact

112
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
which, after all,
is conspicuous to everybody, that all
this
labour
finally comes to nothing.
For, as the pretended
private visions narrated
in the book cannot prove them-
selves, the motive
for bothering oneself with them could
lie only
in the supposition that the author might offer in
substantiation happenings
of the above-mentioned kind
which
could
be
confirmed
by
living
witnesses.
But
nothing of the kind
is
found.
And thus we retire with
some
confusion
from
a
foolish
attempt,
making
the
rational though somewhat belated observation that
it
is
often
easy
to think
wisely, but unfortunately only
after
one has been for some time deceived.
I have treated an unfruitful subject which the inquiries
and importunity of idle and inquisitive friends has forced
upon me.
By submitting my labours to their curiosity,
I have
still
left their expectation unrewarded, and have
satisfied neither the curious by novelties, nor the studious
by
reasons.
If
I had been animated
in
this work by
no other intentions than those just stated,
I should have
wasted my time
;
for
I have
lost the confidence of the
reader, whom,
in
his
inquisitiveness and
eagerness
to
know,
I
have
led
by a
tiresome
roundabout way
to
the
same
point
of
ignorance
from
which
he
started.
But I really had an aim in view that seemed to me more
important than
the pretended one, and
that,
I
believe,
I have attained.
^ Metaphysics, with which
it
is my fate
to be
in
love, although only
rarely can
I
boast of any
favours from
her,
offers two
advantages.
The
first
is

A DREAMER'S ECSTA TIC JOURNE V.
113
that
it
serves
to
solve the
tasks which
the questioning
mind sets itself when by means of reason
it inquires into
the hidden qualities of things.l
But here the result only
too often falls below expectation, and
also
this time
the
answer has evaded our too eager grasp.
Ter frustr.i comprensa manus, effugit imago,
Par levibus ventis volucrique siniillima somno.
—Virgil.
The
other
advantage
is
more
adapted
to
human
reason,
and
consists
in
recognizing
whether
the
task
be
within
the
limits
of
our knowledge and
in
stating
its relation
to the conceptions derived from experience,
for
these
must
always
be
the
foundation
of
all
our
judgments.
In so
far metaphysics
is the science of the
boundaries of human
reason.
And as a small
country,
always
has
many
boundaries,
and
is
generally
more
careful
to
intimately know and
defend
its
possessions
than
blindly to
set out upon conquests,
it
is this use of
metaphysics, as setting boundaries, which is at the same
time
the
least
known
and
the
most
important,
and
which
further
is obtained only late and by long
experi-
ence.
In this case
I indeed have not accurately defined
the
boundaries
;
but
I
have
indicated
them
for
the
reader
so
far
that,
after
further
consideration,
he
will
find himself able to do without such vain investigations
about a question the data of which he has to seek
in a
world
different from that of which he
is sensible.
Thus
I
have wasted my
time
that
I
might
gain
it.
I
have
deceived the reader so
that
I
might be of use
to him.

114
DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER.
and although
I
have
offered
him
no new knowledge,
I have nevertheless destroyed that vain belief and empty
knowledge
which
inflates
reason,
and,
in
its
narrow
space,
takes the place which might be occupied by the
teachings of wisdom and of useful instruction.
The impatience
of
the
reader, whom
our considera-
tions thus far have only wearied without giving instruction,
may be appeased by the words with which Diogenes
is
said
to have cheered his yawning
listeners when he saw
the last page of a tiresome book
:
" Courage, gentlemen,
I
see
land
!
"
Before, we
walked, like
Demokritus,
in
empty space, whither we had flown on the butterfly-wings
of
metaphysics, and
there we conversed
with
spiritual
beings.
Now, since the sobering power of self-recognition
has caused the silky wings to be folded, we find ourselves
again on the ground of experience and common
sense.
Happy,
if we look at
it as the place allotted to us, which
we never can leave with impunity, and which
contains
everything
to
satisfy
us
as
long
as we hold
fast
to the
useful.

THIRD
CHAPTER.
PRACTICAL
CONCLUSION FROM THE WHOLE TREATISE.
It
is
the
zeal
of a
sophist
to
inquire
into any
idle
proposition and to set to the craving after knowledge no
other limits than impossibility.
But to select from among
the innumerable tasks before us the one which humanity
must solve,
is the merit
of the
wise.
After science has
completed
its
course,
it
naturally
arrives
at
a modest
mistrust and, indignant with
itself,
it
says
:
How many
things theri' are which
I do not understand
I
But reason,
matured by experience so as
to become wisdom, speaks
through
the
mouth
of
Socrates when, among
all
the
merchandise of a
fair,
he
says
serenely
:
" How many
things there are which
I do not need
! "
In this manner
two endeavours of a dissimilar nature flow together
into
one, though in the beginning they set out in very different
directions, the one being vain and discontented, the other
staid and content.
To be able to choose rationally, one
must know
first even the unnecessary, yea the impossible
;
then, at
last, science arrives at the definition of the limits
set
to human
reason
by
nature.
All
hollow
schemes,
perhaps not unworthy in themselves but lying outside of the
sphere of men, will then flee to the limbus of vanity.
Then
even metaphysics will become that from which at present

Il6

it is rather far off, and which would seem the last thing to
be expected of her—the companion of wisdom.
As long as
people think
it
still
possible to attain knowledges about
things so far off, wise simplicity may call out in vain that
such
great
endeavours
are
unnecessary.
The pleasure
accompanying
the
extension
of knowledge
will
easily
make
it appear a duty, and
will
consider
deliberate and
intentional
contentedness
to
be
foolish
simplicity,
opposed
to
the
improvement
of
our
nature.
The
questions about
the
spiritual nature, about freedom and
predestination, the
future
state,
&c.,
at
first animate all
the powers of reason, and through
their excellency draw
man into the
rivalry of a speculation which reasons and
decides, teaches and
refutes without
discrimination, just
according
to
the
nature
of
the
apparent knowledge in
each
case.
But
if
this
investigation
develop
into
philosophy which judges its own proceedings, and which
knows
not
only
objects,
but
their
relation
to
man's
reason, then
the
lines
of demarcation
are drawn closer,
and the boundary stones are
laid which
in
future never
allow
investigation
to wander beyond
its proper district.
We had to make use
of a good
deal
of philosophy
to
know the
difficulties surrounding a conception generally
treated
as
being
very
convenient and common.
Still
more philosophy moves this phantom
of knowledge yet
further away, and convinces us that
it
is entirely beyond
the horizon of man.
For
in
the
relations
of cause and
effect, of substance and
action, philosophy at first serves
to dissolve the complicated phenomena, and
to reduce

PRACTICAL CONCLUSION.
117
them to simpler conceptions.
But when one has, finally,
arrived
at
fundamental
relations,
philosophy
has
no
business any more.
Questions like " How something can
be a cause, or possess power," can never be decided by
reason
;
but
these
relations
must
be
taken
from
experience
alone.
For
the
rules
of
our
reason
are
applicable only to comparison
in
respect
to
identity or
contrast.
But
in
the
case
of
a
cause
something
is
assumed
to have come from something
else
;
one can
find
therefore
no
connection
in
regard
to
identity.
In
the same
way,
if
this
effect
is
not
already
implied
in
what
preceded,
a
contrast
can
never
be
made
out
;
because
it
is
not
contradictory
to
merely
assume
one
thing
and
abolish
another.
Thence
the
fundamental
conceptions of
causes,
of
forces,
and
of
actions,
if
they
are
not
taken
from
experience,
are
entirely
arbitrary,
and
can
be
neither
proved
nor
dis-
proved.-'^
'••
I know that
will and understanding move
my
body,
but
I
can
never
reduce
by
analysis
this
phenomenon,
as
a
simple
experience,
to
another
experience, and can,
therefore, indeed
recognize
it,
but
not understand
it.
That my
will moves my arm
is not
more
intelligible to me than
if somebody
said to me that
he could stop the moon
in
his
orbit.
The difference is
only
that
the one
I
experience,
but
that
the
latter has
neVer occurred to me.
I recognize in myself changes as
of a
living

kinil from any of those which,

my body,
I have good reason
to conceive of an incorpo-
real and constant being.
Whether such a being be able
to think also without connection
with a body, can never
be
concluded
from
this
empirical
conception
of
its
nature.
I am
conjoined with
beings kindred to myself
by means of corporeal
laws, but whether
I am, or ever
shall be, conjoined according to other laws which
I
will
call spiritual, without the instrumentality of matter,
I can
in no way conclude from what is given to me.
All such
opinions,
as those concerning
the manner
in which the
soul moves my body,
or
is
related to other beings, now,
or in future,
can never be anything more than
fictions.
And
they
are
far from
having
even
that
value which
fictions
of science,
called
hypotheses,
have.
For
with
these no fundamental powers
are invented
; only those
known already by experience are connected according to
the
phenomena
;
their
possibility,
therefore, must
be
provable
at
any
moment.
It
is
different
in
the
former
case,
when
even
new
fundamental
relations
of
cause
and
effect
are
assumed,
the
possibility
of which can never, nor in any way, be ascertained, and
which thus
are only invented by
creative genius
or by
chimera, whichever you like to call
it.
That several true
or pretended phenomena can be comprehended by means
of such assumed fundamental ideas, cannot ai all be quoted
in their favour.
For a reason may be given for everything,
if one
is
entitled
to
invent
at
will
actions and
laws
of
operation,
^^'e must wait, therefore, until perhaps in the
future world, by new experiences, we are informed about

PRACTICAL CONCLUSION.
119
new
conceptions
concerning
powers
in
our
thinking
selves
which,
as
yet,
are
hidden
to
us.
Thus
the
obser\'ations
of
later
days,
analysed
by
mathematics,
have
revealed
to
us
the power of attraction
in
matter,
concerning
the
possibility
of which we
shall
never be
able to learn anything further, because
it seems to be a
fundamental
power.
Those who
would
have
invented
such
a
quality
without
first
having obtained
the
proof
from
experience,
would
rightly
have
deserved
to
be
laughed at as fools.
Because, in such
cases, reasons are
of no account whatever, neither for the sake of inventing,
nor of confirming the possibility or impossibility of certain
results
: the right of decision must be
left to experience
alone.
Just as
I
leave to time, which brings experience,
the ascertainment of something about the famous healing-
powers
of
the
magnet
in
cases
of
toothache,
when
experience
shall have produced as many observations to
the effect
that magnetic rods act upon
flesh and
bones,
as we have already proving
their effect on steel and
iron.
But,
if certain pretended experiences cannot be classified
under any law of sensation
that
is unanimously accepted
by men
:
if,
therefore,
they
would
only go
to
prove
irregularity
in
the
testimony
of
the
senses—which,
indeed,
is
the
ca.se
with
rumoured
ghost-stories— then
it
is advisable
to simply ignore them.
For the
lack
of
unanimity and uniformity makes the historic knowledge
about
them
valueless
for
the
proof
of
anything,
and
renders them
unfit
to
serve
as
basis
for
any
law
of
experience
within
the domain of rea.son.

Just
as,
on
the
one
hand,
by
somewhat
deeper
investigation,
one
will
learn
that
convincing
and
philosophic knowledge
is
impossible
in
the case under
consideration,
one
will
have
to
confess,
on
the
other
hand,
in
a quiet and unprejudiced
state of mind,
that
such
knowledge
is
dispensable and
unnecessary.
The
vanity
of science
likes
to excuse
its occupations by the
pretext of importance
; thus
it
is pretended in this case
that a
rational understanding of the
spiritual nature of
the
soul
is
very
necessary
for
the
conviction
of
an
existence
after death
; again, that this conviction
is very
necessary
as a motive for a virtuous
life.
Idle
curiosity
adds that the fact of apparitions of departed souls even
furnishes us with a proof from experience of the existence
of such things.
But
true wisdom
is
the companion of
simplicity, and
as,
with
the
latter,
the
heart
rules
the
understanding,
it generally renders unnecessary the great
preparations of scholars, and
its aims do not need such
means
as
can
never be
at
the command
of
all
men.
What?
is
it good
to be
virtuous only because
there
is
another
world,
or
will
not
actions
be
rewarded
rather
because
they
were good and
virtuous
in
themselves?
Does man's heart not contain immediate moral precepts,
and
is
it absolutely necessary'Jo fix our machinery to
the
other world for the sake of moving man here according
to hisdestiny?
Can he be called honest, can
he
be
called
virtuous, who would
like
to
yield to his favourite
vices
if
only he were not frightened by future
punish-
ment?
Must we not
rather say
that indeed he shuns

the
doing
of
wicked
things,
but
nurtures
the
vicious
disposition in his soul
; that he
loves
the advantages
of
actions similar to virtue, but hates virtue itself?
In
fact,
experience teaches
that
very many who
are
instructed
concerning
the
future
world, and
are
convinced
of
it,
nevertheless
yield
to
vice
and
corruption,
and
only
think upon means cunningly
to escape
the
threatening
consequences of the future.**-
But there probably never
was a righteous soul who could endure the thought that
with death everything would end, and whose noble mind
had not elevated itself to the hope of the
future.
^ There-
fore
it seems to be more
in accordance w ith human nature
and
the
purity
of morals
to base
the expectation of a
future world upon
the sentmient of a good
soul,

conversely,
to base
the
soul 's good
conduct
upon
the
hope of another world.
Of that nature
is also that'rnoral
faith,
the
simplicity
of which
can do
without many a
subtlety of reasoning, and which alone
is appropriate to
man
in any
state, because,
without
deviations,
it guides
him to his true aims.
Let us therefore leave to speculation
and to the care of idle men all the noisy systems of doctrine
concerning such remote subjects.
They
are
really
im-
material to us, and the reasons pro and con which, for the
moment,

perhaps,

But this faith,
they
said, emanated
first from the
learned, who thought concerning the
.soul from things of corporeal
sense, from which they conceived no
other
idea
respecting
it
than
as
of thought
alone,
which, when
without any
subject
in which and from which
it
is viewed,
is as
something
volatile, of pure
ether, which cannot
but
be
dissipated
when
the body
dies.
But
because
the
church,
from
the Word,
believes in the immortality of the soul, they could not but ascribe to
it something vital, such as
is of thought, but
still not any thing with
sensation, such as man
has, until
it
is again conjoined
to the body.
On this opinion is founded the doctrine in regard to the resurrection,
and
the
faith that
there
is to be a conjunction when the
last judg-
ment comes.
Hence
it
is, that when any one thinks about the soul
from doctrine and
at the same time from
hy|X)thesis, he does not at
all comprehend
that
it
is a
spirit, and
that
in
a human
form.
To
this
is added,
that
scarcely any one
at
this day knows what
the
spiritual
is, and
still
less that those who are spiritual, as
all
spirits
and angels are, have any human
form.
Hence
it
is, that almost all
who come from the world wonder vcr)' much that they are alive, and
that they are men equally as before, that they sec, hear, and speak,
and that their body has the sense of touch as before, and
there
is no
difference at
all.
But when
they
cease
to wonder
at
themselves,
they then wonder that the church should know nothing about such a
state
of men
after death, nor about heaven and
hell, when
yet

whatever

of the distinction between

Nor, indeed, can anything
be known of any difference between the life of men and that of beasts,
or between
the more
perfect and the less perfect animals
:
neither
of the differences among
the forms of the vegetable kingdom, nor
among the matters of the mineral kingdom.
From which
it can be
seen that they who are ignorant of these degrees are unable by any
judgment to see causes
; they see only effects, and from
these judge
of causes, which
is done for the most part by an
induction that
is
continuous with effects.
But causes do not produce effects by con-
tinuous but by discrete modes
;
for cause
is one
thing, and
effect is
another.
The
difference between
the two
is
like
the
difference
between
prior and subsequent,
or between
that which
forms and
that which is formed.

nothing
of the

kinds.
These degrees therefore shall be treated of throughout this Part (III. ),
for
it
is the object of this
little work
to uncover causes, that effects
may be seen from them, and thus the darkness may be dispelled in
which
the man of the church
is
in
respect
to God and the Lord,
and in respect to Divine things in general which are called spiritual
things.
This
I may mention, that
the
angels are
in
grief for
the
darkness on the earth
; saying that they see light hardly anywhere,
and that men eagerly lay hold of fallacies and confirm them, thereby
multiplying
falsities upon
falsities
;
and
to
confirm
fallacies men
search
out, by means of reasonings from
falsities and from
truths
falsified, such
things
as cannot be
overturned, owing to the dark-
ness
in
respect
to causes and the
ignorance
respecting
truths."

"The
reason
of
this
is,
that
all
things which
appear
in
the
spiritual world
exist
immediately from
the
sun
of heaven,
which
is the
divine
love of the Lord
;
whereas
all
things which appear
in the natural world exist from the same source, but by means of the
sun
of this world, which
is pure
fire.
Pure
love, from which all
things
exist immediately from
the
Lord,
is immaterial
;
but
pure
fire, through which
all things
exist mediately
in the natural world,
is
material.
Hence
it
is
that all
things which exist in the spiritual
world
are, from
their
origin,
spiritual
; and
that
all
things which
exist in the natural world, are, from their secondary origin, material.
Material things are also in themselves fixed, stated, and measurable.
They are
fixed,
because, however
the
states
of men change,
they
continue permanent, as
the
earth, mountains, and
seas.
They are
stated,
because
they
constantly
recur
in
their
turns,
as
seasons,
generations, and
germinations.
They are
measurable,
because
all
things may be defined
; as spaces, by means of miles and furlongs, and
these by means of paces and yards
;
times again, by means of days,
weeks, months, and years.
But
in the spiritual world all things are
as
if they were
fixed, stated, and measurable,
but
still
they are not
so
in
reality
;
for they exist and continue according
to the states of
the
angels,
so
that with
these very
states
they make one
;
they
therefore vary also, as these states vary.
"I
can
positively
affirm
that
the
objects which
exist
in
the
spiritual world are even more
real than
those
in
the natural
;
for
that which
is in nature added
to the spiritual
principle
is dead, and
does
not
produce
reality,
but
diminishes
it.
That
there
is
this
diminution
arising from this cause
is plainly evident from
the state
of the angels of heaven compared with
that
of men on earth, and
from
all
the
objects
existing
in
heaven compared
with
all
those
existing in the world.
" .Since there are in heaven objects similar to those which exist in
our world,
there are
therefore spaces and times there also
;
but the
spaces,
like
the
earth
itself
there and
the
objects
upon
it,
are
appearances.
For they ajipear according to the states of the angels;
and
the extensions of sjiaces, or the distances, are according
to the
similarities and
dissimilarities
of
these
states."

such as angels have,
it can be comprehended, because in such there is
no space.
But even by a natural idea this much can be comprehended,
that
love and wisdom (or what
is the same, the Lord, who is divine
Love and
divine Wisdom) cannot advance through
spaces, but
is
present with each one according to reception."
D. L. and VV.,

It is to be constantly borne
in mind
that with Swedenlwrg the
divine Love and Wisdom are not only substantial entities, but
they
are the very substance itself
;
the divine Love being
the Substance
itself, and
the divine Wisdom
the Form
itself, from which proceed
all
substances and
all
forms.
On
this
profoundest
of
all
meta-
physical subjects Swedenborg says
:
" The
idea of men
in general about
love and about wisdom
is
like something hovering and
floating
in
thin
air
or ether
;
or
like
what exhales from something of this kind.
Scarcely any one lielieves
that they are really and
actually substance and
form.
Even those
who
recognise
that they are substance and form
still think
of the
love and the wisdom outside the subject and as issuing from
it.
For
they
call substance and form
that which they think of outside the
subject and as issuing from
it, even though
it be something hovering
and
floating
;
not knowing
that
love and wisdom are
the subject
itself, and that what
is perceived outside of it and
as hovering and
floating
is nothing but an appearance of the state of the subject in
itself.
There
are
several
reasons why
this has not hitherto
been
seen, one of which
is, that appearances are
the
first things out
of
which the human mind
forms its understanding, and
these appear-
ances the mind can shake off only by the exploration of causes
; and
if the
cause
lies deeply hidden,
the mind
can
explore
it only by
keeping the understanding
for a long time
in
spiritual
light
; and
this
it cannot do by reason of the natural
light which
continually
withdraws
it.
The truth
is, however, that love and wisdom are the
real
and
actual
substance
and
form
that
constitute
the
subject
itself."—Z>. L.
W., 40.

there
is
life in all

parts
of man
is, that the
various and diverse
things
existing

which
are
called members,
organs,
and
viscera,
numerous
as they are, so make one that he has no other knowledge
than that he is a simple, rather than a compound being.

the case unless the organs of those senses also lived from the life of his
soul
;
tliat the whole
surface of his Ixjcly is endued with the sense of
touch, since
it
is the life, and not the skin without it, which produces
this sense.
The reason
that there
is
life in all the several and most
ntinute parts of man
is, that
the animal
form,
of which we have
treated above, is the essential form of life."
Athan.

*^ Love or the ivill is man's very life.
.
.
. As all things
of the body depend for existence and motion upon the heart, so do all
things of the mind depend
for existence and
life upon the will.
It
is
said, upon
the
will, but
this means upon
the
love,
because
the
will
is the receptacle of love, and love is life itself (see above, n.
1-3),
and love, which
is life itself,
is from the Lord alone.
" And as the human form
is made up of
all
tlie things there are
in man,
it follows that love or the will
is in a continual conatus and
effort to form all these.
There
is a conatus and
effort towards the
human form, because (]od
is a Man, and
Divine Love and Divine
Wisdom
is His
life, and
from
His
life
is everything of
life.
Any
one can
sec
that unless
Life which
is very man
acted
into
that
which in itself
is
not
life, the formation of anything such
as
exists
in man would be
impossible,
in whom are thousands of thousands
of things
that make one
thing, and that unanimously aspire
to an
image of the Life from whicli
ihey spring, that man may become a
rece|)tacle and abode of that
Life.
From
all
this
it
can
be seen
that love, and out of the love the will, and out of the will the heart,
strives unceasingly towards the human form."

*^ "'^n from his spirit, and not from his body
and that the corporeal form is added to the spirit according to its form,
and not the reverse, for the spirit
is clothed with
a body according
to its own form.
F'or this reason the spirit of man
acts
into every
part, yea, into the minutest particulars of the body, insomuch
that
the part which
is r\iA actuated by the spirit, or in which the spirit
is
not acting, docs not live.
That this
is so, may
be known
to every
one from this fact alone, that thought and will actuate each and
all
things of the body with such entire command that every thing concurs,
and whatever does not concur
is not a part of the body, and
is also
cast out as something in which
is no
life.
Thought and
will
are of
the spirit of man, and not
of the body.
That
the
spirit
does
not
appear to man in a human form, after
it
is loo.-ed from the luxly, nor
in another man,

is material
sees
what is material only.
••
A deed or work, therefore, viewed in itself,
is
only
an
effect,
which
derives
its
soul and
life from
the
will and
thought, insomuch that
it
is will and thought in effect, consequently
it
is will and thought
in an external
form.
Hence
it
follows
that
such as the will and thought are which produce a deed or work, such
likewise is the deed and work
:
if the thought and will be good, then
the deeds and works are good
; but if the thought and
will be
evil,
then the deeds and works are evil, though in the external form
they
may appear the same."
H. and II., 453, 472.
" The mind (that
is, the will and understanding) impels the
lx)dy
and all its belongings at will.
Does not the body do whatever
the
mind thinks and determines?
Does not the mind incite the ear
to
hear, and direct the eye
to
see, move
the
tongue and
the
lips
to
speak, impel the hands and
fingers
to do whatever
it
pleases, and
the feet to walk whither
it
will?
Is the body,
then, anything but
obedience to its mind
:
and can the body be this unless the mind
is
in its derivatives in the body ?
Is it consistent with reason
to think
that
the
body
acts
from
obedience
simply because
the mind
so
determines?
in which case there would be two, the one above and
the other below, one commanding, the other obeying.
As this is in
no way consistent with reason,
it follows that man's life is in
its
first
principles in the brains, and in
its derivatives in the body (according
to what has been said above,
n.
365)
;
also that such as
life
is
in
first principles, such
it
is in the whole and in every
part
(n.
366)
;
and that by means of these first principles
life
is in
the whole from
every part, and
in every part from the whole (n. 367)
; and that all
things of the mind have relation to the will and
understanding, and
that
the
will
and
understanding
are
the
receptacles
of love and
wisdom from the Lord, and that
these two make the
life of man."

heaven, which
is the Lord
; as the instrumental cause ministers to
its principal cause, or a dead
force
to
its living force.
From this it
is evident how much men
are
in error, who
ascribe
to nature
the
generations of animals and
productions of vegetables
;
for they are
like those who ascrilje magnificent and splendid works
to the
tool
rather
than
to
the
artist,
or who
worship
a sculptured
image
in
preference
to God.
The
fallacies, which
are innumerable
in
all
reasoning on
spiritual,
moral, and
civil
subjects,
originate
in
this
source
;
for a fallacy is the inversion of order
;
it
is the judgment of
the eye,
rather than of the mind,
the conclusion drawn from
the
appearance of a
thing,
rather than from
its
essence.
To reason
therefore from
fallacies
alx)ut
the world and
the existence of the
things contained
in
it
is
to confirm, as
it
were, by argument
that
darkness
is light, that that which
is dead
is alive, and
that the body
enters by influx into the soul, rather than
the contrary.
It
is, how-
ever, an eternal truth that influx
is spiritual, and not
physical
;
that
is,
it
is
from
the
soul, which
is
spiritual,
into
the body which
is
natural, and from
the spiritual world
into the natural
; and
further
that
it
is
the Divine
Being proceeding from
Himself, and
as He
created all
things by that which proceeds from
Himself, so also He
sustains
all
things by
it
; and
lastly, that
sustentation
is perpetual
creation, as subsistence is perpetual existence."
Athan. Cr., 102.
9 (p.
54).—" The end is the all of the cause, and through the cause
is the all of the effect
; and thus end, cause, and effect are called
first,
middle, and last end
; further the cause of the cause
is also the cause
of the thing caused
; and
there
is nothing essential in causes except
the
end,
and
nothing
essential
in
motion except
conatus
;
also,
the substance that
is substance in itself is the sole substance.
" From all this
it can clearly be seen
that
the
Divine, which
is
substance in
itself,
that
is,
the one only and
sole substance,
is the
substance from which
is each and every thing that has been created
;
thus
that
God
is

" The principal end is the love of man's will, the intermediate ends
are subordinate loves, and the ultimate end
is the will's love existing
as
it were in

is
the
will's
love,
it
follows
that

provided, and produced by the will's love, through the understand-
ing
; for everything that love produces is use."
Athan.
Cr., 77.
10 (p. 54).—" Tke conjunction of man's spirit with his body is by
means of the correspondence of his will and understanding with
his
heart and lungs, and their separation isfrom non-correspondence.—As
it has heretofore been unknown that man's mind, by which is meant
the will and understanding,
is his spirit, and that the spirit is a man
;
and as
it has been unknown
that man's
spirit, as well as his body,
has a pulse and respiration,
it could not be known that the pulse and
respiration of the spirit in man flow into the pulse and respiration of
his body and produce them.
Since, then, man's spirit, as well as his
body, enjoys a pulse and respiration,
it follows that there
is a like
correspondence of the pulse and respiration of man's spirit with the
pulse and respiration of his body,—for, as was said, his mind
is his
spirit, consequently, when the two pairs of motions cease to corres-
pond, separation takes place, which
is death.
Separation or death
ensues when from any kind of disease or accident the body comes
into such a state as to be unable to act in unison with its spirit, for
thus correspondence perishes, and with it conjunction
; not, however,
when respiration alone ceases, but when the heart's pulsation ceases.
For so long as the heart
is moved,
love with
its
vital heat remains
and preserves
life, as
is evident
in cases of swoon and
suffocation,
and the condition of fetal life in the womb.
In a word, man's bodily
life depends on the correspondence of its pulse and respiration with
the pulse and respiration of his spirit
; and when that correspondence
ceases, the bodily life ceases, and his spirit departs and continues its
life in the spiritual world, which is so similar to his life in the natural
world that he does not know that he has died."

From
this
it

in no respect
be together."—Z». L.

(p.

that
he is not only in the spiritual world
as to his interiors, but also
at the same time in the natural world
as to exteriors.
His exteriors
which are in the natural world, are all things of his natural or external
memory, and
of thought and
imagination
therefrom;
in
general,
knowledges and sciences,
with
their
delights and
gratifications, so
far as they savour of the world, and also many pleasures belonging to
the sensuals of the body,
together
with
his
senses
themselves, his
speech, and
actions.
All
these
also are
the
ultimate
things
into
which the divine influx of the Lord closes;
for
it does
not stop
in
the midst, but
proceeds to
its ultimates.
From these things
it may
be manifest that in man
is the ultimate of divine order, and because
it is the ultimate, that
it
is also the
basis and foundation.
Because
the

of the

the
ultimate
is

is nothing given which
is unconnected,
it follows that such
is the connection and conjunction of heaven with
the human race, that the one subsists from
the
other, and
that
the
human
race

also be
called
soul, because
all

that which

that which

upon that, for instance, which

it causes
it either to live as

latter with vegetables.
The reason that nothing

is,
that no effect
is produced without a cause.
Such
is
the
case
with
nature
;
all
the
several
and
most
minute
objects
belonging
to
it
are
effects produced from
a cause, which
is
prior,
interior, and superior
to
it, and proceeding immediately from God.
For since there
exists a spiritual world, which
is prior, interior, and
superior,
to
the
natural
world,
therefore
all
that
belongs
to
the
spiritual world
is cause, and all that belongs to the natural world
is
effect."—^/^.
Cr., 94.
14 (P-
57)-— " That nature serves as a covering
for that which is
spiritual,
is
evident from
the
souls
of
beasts, which
are
spiritual
affections, being clothed from
materials in
the world,
it being well
known
that their bodies are material
;
so
also the bodies of men.
The reason that the spiritual can be clothed from the material
is, that
all the objects which exist in nature, whether they belong
to atmos-
phere, to water, or to earth, are, as to every individual of them, effects
produced from the spiritual as a cause.
The effects again act as one
with the cause, and are in complete agreement with
it, according to
the axiom, that nothing
exists in
the effect
that
is not in the cause.
But the difference
is, that
the cause
is a
living force, because
it
is
spiritual, while the effect derived from
it
is
a dead force, because it
is natural.
From this
it
is, that
there are in the natural world such
objects as are in complete agreement
with
those which exist in
the
spiritual world, and that the former can be suitably conjoined
with
the latter.
Hence then
it
is, that
it
is said that nature was created
that the spiritual may be clothed from
it with forms to serve for use.
That nature was created that
the
spiritual may be terminated in
it,
follows from what
has been
already
said, that
the
objects
in
the
spiritual
world
are
causes,
while
those
in
the
natural world
are
effects, and effects are limits."

;

for causes
from effects is not
to be

because
fallacies then present them-

into
foolishness.

things

the one world cannot see those
who are in the other world.
For
the eyes of man, who sees from
natural
light, are of the substance of his world, and
the eyes of an
angel
are of the substance of his world
;
thus in both cases they are
formed
for the proper reception of their own light.
From all this it
can be seen how much ignorance
there
is
in the thoughts of those
who,
liecause
they
cannot
see angels and
spirits
with
their

are unwilling to believe them to be men.
" Hitherto it has not been known
that angels and spirits are in a
totally different light and different heat from men.
It has not been
known even that another
light and another heat are
possible.
For
man

not

in

within

not above

out

But,
in
truth,
angels and spirits are entirely above or out of nature, and in their
own world, which
is under another
sun.
And since in that world
spaces are appearances
(as was shown
above),
angels and
spirits
cannot be
said to be in the ether or in the
stars
;
in
fact,
they
are
present
with man,
conjoined
to
the
affection and
thought
of his
spirit
;— for man,
in
that he thinks and
wills,
is
a
spirit

is where man
is, and
in no wise away
from him.
In
a
word,
every man
as regards
the

he thinks from its light, and loves from its heat."

" To the above
it is proper to add that every man, even while he

is as to

a good man

society, and an evil man in an infernal
society
; and he comes also
into
the same
society after
death.

not
indeed appear
in

;

those who

attached
to them

is
the

from which

first state after death
is passed through,
which
is the slate of the exteriors, the man-spirit
is
let into the state
of his interiors, or into the state of his interior will and
its thought, in
which ho had been in the world when
left to himself to think
freely
and without restraint.
Into this state he glides without being aware
of
it,
in
like
manner
as
in
the
world, when
he
withdraws
the
thought which
is nearest to the speech, or from which the speech
is,
towards
his interior thought, and abides in
that.
When, therefore,
the man-spirit
is in this
state, he is in himself and
in
his own very
life
;
for to think
freely from
his own
affection
is
the very
life of
man, and
is himself.
" The spirit in this state thinks from his own very will, thus from
his own very affection, or from
his own very love
; and
in this case
the thought makes one with the will, and one in such a manner that
it
scarcely appears
that
the
spirit
thinks, but
that
he
wills.
The
case is nearly
similar when he speaks
yet with this difference, that
he speaks with some degree
of
fear
lest
the
thoughts
of the
will
should go forth naked, since by civil
life in the world
this habit also
had become of his will."— //. //.

(n. 470—484).
He who wills and loves evil
in the world, wills and
loves evil
in the other
life, and then he no
longer suffers himself
to
be withdrawn from
it.
Hence
it
is that the man who
is
in
evil
is
tied
to
hell, and
likewise
is actually there as lo
his spirit, and
after
death desires nothing more than to be where his own evil
is
;
conse-
quently
it
is man after death who casts himself into hell, and not the

Lord.
For no one comes into hell until he
is in his own evil and in
the
falsities of evil, since
it is not allowed any one
there
to have a
divided mind, namely,
to
think and
speak one
thing and
to
will
another.
Every
evil
spirit must there
think what
is
false derived
from evil, and must speak from the
falsities of evil
;
in both cases
from the will, thus from his own love and
its delight and
pleasure
;
just
as
in
the world when he thought
in
his
spirit, that
is, as he
thought
in himself when he thought from
interior
affection.
The
reason is that the will is the man
himself, and not the thought, only
so far as it partakes of the will, and the will
is the very nature itself
or disposition of the man
; thus to be let into his will is to be let into
his nature or disposition, and likewise into
his
life."

to
his own
society
in which

for every man as
to
his
spirit
is con-
joined to some society, either infernal or heavenly, a wicked man to
an infernal society, a good man to a heavenly society (see n. 438). The
spirit
is brought
to that society successively, and at length enters
it.
An
evil
spirit when he is in the
state of his

is turned by
degrees
to
his own society, and
at length directly
to
it, before

The divine
truth proceeding from

what makes order, and divine truths are the laws of order, according
to which
the Lord
leads man.
For
this reason
to save man by
immediate mercy is contrary to divine order, and what
is contrary
to divine order
is contrary to the
Divine.
Divine order
is heaven
with man, which order man
had perverted with
himself by a
life
contrary to the laws of order, which are divine
truths.
Into
that
order man is brought back by the Lord out of pure mercy, by means
of the laws of order
; and
so
far as he
is brought back, so
far he
receives heaven
in
himself, and he who receives heaven
in himself,
comes
into
heaven.

again
it
is

that
the divine

pure
mercy,

in the spiritual.
According to this law of correspondence the Word
was
written
in which
all
the words and
senses
of the words are
correspondences, and
thus contain
a
spiritual
or
internal
sense, in
which
the angels are.
For
this reason, when man reads the Word
and perceives
it according
to the sense of
tlie
letter, or the external
sense, the angels
perceive
it
according to
the
internal
or
spiritual
sense
;
for
all
the thought
of the
angels
is
spiritual,
whereas
the
thought
of man
is natural.
These thoughts indeed appear diverse,
Init
still they are one, because they correspond
The
natural ideas of man thus pass into spiritual
ideas with angels, with-
out their knowing anything of the sense of the
letter of the Word
;
as of a new heaven and
a new
earth, a new city of Jerusalem,
its
wall, the
foundations of the wall, and
the measures.
Nevertheless
the thoughts of angels make one with
the thoughts of man, because
they correspond.
They make one almost like the words of a speaker,
and
the understanding of them by a hearer who docs not attend
to
the words, but only to the meaning
When, therefore,
the angels
think
thus
spiritually, and man
thus naturally, they are
conjoined almost like soul and body:
the internal sense of the Word
also is its soul, and the sense of the
letter
is
its body.
Such
is the
Word throughout
: hence
it
is evident
that
it
is a medium
of the
conjunction of heaven with man, and
that
its literal sense serves for
abasis and foundation."

is a recipient of the
life both of the three degrees of the
natural world and of the three degrees of the spiritual world.
From
this
it
is that man can be elevated above nature, while
the animal
cannot.

that he
is angry with him on account of evil

and
with some
it
is supposed
still
further, that God
punishes man and
does evil
to him.
In this ojnnion they confirm themselves from the

altogether
different
;
and
that hence
the genuine
doctrine
of the
church,
which
is from
the
spiritual
sense
of the
Word,
teaches otherwise, namely,
that God never turns away His
face from man and rejects him from
Himself,
that He does not cast
any one into hell and that He
is not angry with any one.
Every
one also
whose mind
is
in
a
state
of illustration when he
reads
the Word,
perceives
this to be the case, from the fact that God
is
good
itself,
love itself, and mercy itself; and that good itself cannot
do evil to any one, also that love itself and mercy itself cannot reject
man from
itself, because
it
is contrary to the very essence of mercy
and
love,
thus contrar)' to the Divine
Itself.
Wherefore they who
think from an enlightened mind when they read the Word,
clearly
perceive
that God
never turns
Himself away from man,
that He
deals with him from good, love, and mercy
;
that
is, that He wills
his
good,
that He
loves
him,
and
that He
is
merciful
to him.
Hence
also they see that the
literal sense is spoken in accommoda-

to
the
apprehension
of man,

to
his

seen, but in phantasy. The spirits which induce such phantasies work
upon persons of weak minds, and who are
easily credulous
; such
persons are visionaries, and
the
things which
they see are illusions
conjured
up
from
outward
objects,

in

light.
Visions caused by enthusiastic
spirits
are
similar to these, but refer
to subjects of belief."

(P-
73)-—How
little
Kant was capable
of making
a
true
psychological
estimate
of
.Swedenborg's
experience
is abundantly
shown in this single allusion which reveals the
fact that either Kant
was
entirely
ignorant
of Swedenliorg's
public
life, or else that
he,
like others since his time, shirked the difTicult problem of reconciling
Swedenborg's
political
activity
as
a
trusted
and
highly
valued
member of the Mouse of Nobles, and as an important contributor to
the
science of
his
time,
with
these charges of " foolishness " and
" lack of this worhi's intelligence."
The " Traume " was published
in 1766.
In 1760 Swedenborg had presented in the Diet of .Sweden
the following papers
:
Memorial in favour of returning to pure metallic currency.
Appeal in favour of the Restoration of a Metallic Currency.
Additional Considerations with respect to the Course ofExchange.
Memorial to the Ring against the expirtation of Copper.
Memorial declining to become a Commissioner on Exchange.

It
is difficult to conceive that a man deserving to be characterised
as "a fool on earth," and as "lacking in
this
world's
intelligence''
should have been
invited
by
the Swedish House
of Knights and
Nobles to sit as a member of a
private Commission on
Exchange.
The fact
is also to be borne in mind that, at this date, Swedenborg's
Arcana had
not only
been
entirely
published
and
circulated, but
that his own authorship of the work, printed anonymously, was now
publicly revealed.
In the same year, 1761, in which he was writing
several of his minor
treatises, on
the
Spiritual World, and on
the
Sacred Scriptures, on
Faith, and on
the Last Judgment,
he was
engaged in a political
controversy
with
Councillor Nordencranz in
defence of Von Hoepken and
the Swedish Government, and sent a
Memorial to the Diet on The Maintenance of the
Country and the
Preservation of its Freedom (Documents I., 510-538).
Swedenborg
filled the office for many years of Assessor of the Royal
College of
Mines, was one of the Founders of the Royal Academy of Sciences
at Stockholm, was
a member
of the Academy of Sciences
in
St.
Petersburg,
and
of
the
Society
of Sciences at Upsala.
Christian
Wolf and
foreign men
of
learning
addressed him
by
letter,
in
order to obtain his ideas on
subjects which
they found
it difficult to
fathom.
[See also Sir Samuel Sandel's Eulogy over Swedenborg in
the
House
of Nobles,
in
the
name
of
the
Royal Academy
of
Sciences, October 7th, 1772.]
40 (p.
76).—Swedenborg
states
that
the
things recorded
in
his
" Memorabilia " are
not " visions " properly
so
called, but
scenes
beheld in
the most
perfect
state
of bodily wakefulness and which
" I have now experienced
for several years."
Arcana,
1885.
He
describes two
other kinds of vision which
he rarely experienced,
one as being " taken out of the body " or reduced to a certain state
between sleeping and waking
: during
his continuance in this state
he cannot
but know that he
is
wide awake.
This
is
such as
is
mentioned in
Cor.
xiii.,
3.
The other kind of vision
is that which
is called " being carried by the spirit
into another place,"

Of dreams Swedenborg says
:
"Visions

41
(p. 77).—On the subjective origin of sight, as of all the senses,
Swedenborg treats in the following numbers of the Arcana
:—
" It
is not
the body
that
sees and otherwise
sensates,
but
the
spirit in the body
; hence, when the body
is put
off by death, the
spirit is in full enjoyment of its senses."— 4622.
" The corporeal man as the receptacle of the sensitive consists of
sensual faculties subject to the understanding and
will.
Sight
is the
principal of these, subject
to the
intellectual
part
; and hearing
to
the voluntary part
; smell and taste conjoin both."—5077.
"The sensual
faculty
of sight
has
its
life
from
the
intellectual
because the latter sees from the light of heaven."—5114.
" Divine Truth from the Lord
is
light, which light illumines the
mind of man and gives him internal sight or understanding."—9399.
" What the will, or voluntarj-
part of man, determines into form,
appears to the sight in the intellectual
part, which sight is thought."
—9915.
42
(p.
79).— " The sight of the eye, strictly speaking,
is nothing
but the sight of the spirit produced outwards."
Arcana, 1806.
43 (p. 82).—"The five sensories of the body, by virtue of an influx
from within, are sensible of the impressions which enter by
influx
from without
; the influx from within
is from the spiritual world, but
the influx from without is from the natural. With these facts the laws
inscribed on
the nature of
all
things are in concert, and
these laws
are:
1. That nothing exists,
subsists,
is acted upon or moved by
itself,
but by some other being
or agent
; whence
it
follows
that
everything
exists, subsists,
is acted upon and moved
by
the
First
Being, who hxs no origin from another, but
is in Himself the living
force which
is
life.
2. That nothing can be acted upon or moved,
unless
it
is intermediate between two
forces, of which
the one acts
and the other re-acts
;
thus, unless one acts on one part, and one on
the other
; and, further, unless one acts from within, and
the other
from without.
3. And since these two forces, whilst they are at rest,
produce an equilibrium,
it follows that nothing can be acted \\\>on or
moved, unless
it
is in equilibrium, and that when
it
is acted upon,
it
is out of the equilibrium
; and, further, that everything acted upon
or moved seeks to return
to an equilibrium.

arc changes of state and
variations of form, and
that
the
latter are
derived from the former.
By state
in man we mean
his love
; and
by changes of state the affections of love
; by form
in him we mean
his
intelligence, and by variations of form, his thoughts
;
the latter
also are from the former."
Ath. Cr.^ 45.
44 (p. 87).—The reality of heaven
is deduced by Swedenborg not
from the hopes of man, but from the laws of divine order.
" The laws of order are called the laws of the Divine Providence,
and of these
the
natural mind can have no knowledge, unless
it
is
enlightened.
And because man
has no knowledge
of them, and
thus
forms
his
conclusions
concerning
the
Divine
Providence
from
contingencies
in
the
world, and
by
these
means
falls
into
fallacies and
thence
into
errors,
from
which
he
afterwards
with
difficulty extricates himself, they must
therefore be brought
to light.
But
before they
are brought
to
light,
it
is
of importance
that
it
should
be known,
that
the Divine
Providence operates
in
all
the
several
things which belong
to man, even
in
the most minute
of
them all, for his eternal salvation;
his salvation having been the end
of
the
creation both of hea\en and
earth.
For
the end was,
that
out of the human race might be formed heaven, in which God might
dwell,
as
in
his own
special abode, and
therefore the salvation of
man
is
the
all
in
all
of the Divine
Providence.
But
the
Divine
Providence proceeds so secretly, that man scarcely sees a vestige of it,
and yet
it
is active
in
the most minute particulars relating
to him,
from infancy to old age in the world, and afterwards to eternity
; and
in every one of them
it is eternity which it regards.
Because the divitu
wisdom in itself is vothing but an end, providence therefore cuts from
an end, in an end, and with reference to an end ; the end being that
man tnay become wisdom and love, and thus the dwelling-place and
the image of the divine life."—Ath.
Cr., 36.
45 (p.
8S).— " There
is a correspondence of the will and under-
standing with the heart and lungs, consequently a correspondence of
all things of the mind with all things of the body.—This is new
:
it
has hitherto been unknown because
it has not been known what the
spiritual
is, and how
it differs horn the natural
;
therefore
it has not
been known what correspondence
is
;
for there
is a correspondence
between things spiritual and things natural, and by means of corres-
pondence they are conjoined.
It is said that heretofore there has been
no knowledge of what the spiritual
is, or of what its correspondence

145
with the natural
is, and therefore what correspondence
is
;
yet these
might have been known.
Who does not know
that
aft'ection and
thought
are
spiritual,
therefore
that
all
things
of
affection
and
thought
are
spiritual ?
Who does not know that action and speech
are
natural,
therefore
that
all
things
of
action
and
speech
are
natural ?
Who does not know
that
affection and
thought,
which
are
spiritual,
cause man to act and to speak ?
From
this who may
not see what correspondence
is between
things
spiritual and things
natural ?
Does not thought make
the tongue speak, and
affection
together with thought make
the body
act ?
There are two distinct
things
:
I can think without speaking, and
I can will without acting
;
and the body,
it
is known, neither thinks nor wills, but thought
falls
into speech, and will descends into action."
D. L. W., 374.
46 (p. 88).— '* The practical ability of the reason dependent on the
will.—Every man
is born into a capacity to understand truths to the
inmost degree in which the angels
of the
third heaven are
;
for the
human understanding, rising up by continuity around the two higher
degrees, receives the light of their wisdom.
Therefore man has the
ability to become rational according to his elevation
; if raised to the
third degree he becomes rational from
that degree,
if raised to the
second degree he becomes rational from that degree,
if not raised he
is rational in the
first
degree.
It
is said
that he becomes
rational
from
those
degrees,
because
the
natural
degree
is
the
general
receptacle of their
light.
The reason why man
does
not become
rational
to
the height
that he might
is,
that
love,
which
is of the
will, cannot be raised
in
the same manner
as wisdom,
which
is of
the understanding.
Love, which
is of the
will,
is
raised only by
shunning evils as sins, and then by goods of charity, which are uses,
which the man thereafter performs from
the
Lord.
Consequently,
when
love, which
is of the
will,
is not
at
the same
time
raised,
wisdom,
which
is
of
the
understanding,
however
it
may
have
ascended,
falls
back
again down
to
its own
love.
Therefore
if
man's love
is not at the same time with
his wisdom
raised into the
spiritual
degree,
he
is
rational
only
in
the
lowest
degree."

far
from being " done with" this subject of a
Spiritual
World
Kant
really was, appears
from
his choosing
the
subject
of the

Dissertation in
1770, as well as from the Lectures on Metaphysics, where he dwells

at length on the arguments
for the existence of a spiritual world and
on the nature of the
life
after death.
See the Introductory Essay
for the present work,
p.
28.
48 (p. 93).—"A law of the Divine Providence is: That man should
twt be refo7-med by external means, but by internal ; by external means
are meant miracles and visions, fears and punishments ; by internal,
the truths and goods derived from the Word and the teaching of the
church, and
looking
to
the
Lord.
For
these means enter by an
internal way, and
cast
out
the
evils and falsities
which
reside
within ; but exterttal means enter by an external way, and do not
cast out the evils and falsities, but shut them in.— If man could have
been reformed by miracles and
visions, then all men throughout the
whole world would be so.
It
is, therefore, a holy law of the Divine
Providence that internal freedom should
not in the
least degree be
violated
; for by
it the Lord enters with regard to man, even into the
hell where he
is, and by
it He leads him there
; and if man
is willing
to follow. He brings him out, and introduces him into heaven, there
bringing him nearer and nearer to himself."

50
(p.
101).—Kant,
for
reasons
of
his own,
indulges
in
the
pleasantry of characterising as "full of nonsense" and "void of the
last drop of reason " the great work which he forthwith proceeds to
subject to a careful analysis, resulting in conclusions so similar to those
of speculative reason that he is compelled to admit the resemblance,
even at the risk of the one falling or standing wiih the other.
This
affected ridicule was necessary to the carrying out
of the purpose of
the book itself, which was the discrediting of metaphysics as a source
of knowledge.
It
is
possible that he foresaw, in
the course of his
ingenious and daring essay, that the rationality of a spiritual world,
such as Swedenborg described from
experience, ex visis et auditis,
might,
after
all,
be
turned
by
the
reader
to a
corroboration
of
metaphysical doctrine rather than an argument against
it, and
that,
therefore,
unless he should undo
his work and abandon
his
plan
altogether
there remained
for him only one course, and
that was to
call Swedenborg's system "nonsense," while he
treated
it with the
seriousness of the deepest rational and practical reflection.

EXTRACTS FROM SWEDENBORG.

How
Kant's
critique of Swcdenborg was regarded by
his con-
temjwraries may
appear from
the
following
letter
of
the
Dutch
banker-poet, John Chiistian Cuno
(1708- 1780, the David Paulus ab
Ituiagine,
author
of
a
widely
published
Letter
to
Swedenborg),
addressed
to
a
friend
in Hamburg,
in
1771.
In this
letter Cuno
says of Swedenborg
:
" I am quite willing to confess that
I do not know what to make
of him.
He remains to me a riddle which
I cannot solve.
In 1766
a little work was published in Koenigsberg, by John James
Kanter,
bearing the
title
:
' Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, explained by Dreams
of Metaphysics.'
The author is anonymous.
In volume IV. of the
' Allgemeine
Deutsche
Bibliothek,' which
is
published
in
Berlin,
(p. 281), he
is called
I. Kant.*
But this is a satire which
is directed
more against the learned
in general, than against
the spirit-seers
in
particular.
* The editor of the
•' Sammlung einiger Nachrichten," &c.
, adds
here: "This
is quite
right.
His name
is
Immanuel
Kant,
and
last year,
viz., 1770, he became
professor of logic and
mataphysics
in
Koenigsberg."
In
the
third volume
of the
Griejswalde Neue
Kritische Ncuhrichten (p. 257) we read as follows
:
"The author of
this work, who
is said to be
a Mr. Kant, M.A.,
of Koenigsberg, had his attention directed to the writings of Sweden-
borg
and
his
phenomena,
and
he
was
induced
to
institute
investigations,
the
results
of which
ho now communicates
to
the
world.
His work consists of two parts, a dogmatic and an historical.
In the latter he relates the principal phenomena of Mr. Swedenborg,
most of which are known
to
(jur
readers, and which perhaps might
be augmented
by them
with
additional
ones
; and
afterwards
he
gives extracts of the peculiar sentiments of the author.
In
reality,
however, he considers simply " the things heard and seen," without
taking into consideration the Arcana
CitUitia, a work
tilling
eight
quarto volumes, and in which
is contained
an
entire
hermeneutical
and theological
system.
\Vc
leave
to Mr. Kant to answer
for
his
judgment, which
sometimes
is
very
severe
and
bitter."

anything

yea, also many who

were born within the church deny those things, saying in their heart,
who has come thence anrl told us?
Lest therefore such denial, which
reigns especially with those who have much of the wisdom of the world,
should also infect and corrupt the simple in heart and the simple in
faith,
it has been given me to be together with angels, and
to speak
with them as man with man, and
also to see the things which are in
the heavens and in the hells, and this during thirteen years; and now
to describe them from things seen and heard, hoping that thus ignor-
ance may be enlightened and
incredulity dissipated.
That
at
this
day such immediate revelation
exists,
is because
this
is that which
is meant by the coming of the Lord."
Introduction to H. H.
52 (p.
104).—"Man
has an
external and an
internal memory,
an
external memory which
is
of his natural man, and an
internal
which is of his spiritual man
; and every thing which man has thought,
willed, spoken, done, also which he has heard and seen,
is inscribed
on his internal or spiritual memory
; and the things which are there
are never erased,
since they are inscribed
at the same time on the
spirit itself, and on the members of its body, as was said above ; and
thus
the
spirit
is formed
according
to
the
thoughts
and
acts
of
its will.
I know that these things appear as paradoxes, and conse-
quently are scarcely believed, but
still they are true.
Let not man
therefore believe that any thing which one has thought
in himself,
and has done in secret,
is concealed after death
;
but let him believe
that each and all things then appear as in clear day.
"Although the external or natural memory is in man after death,
still the merely natural things which are therein are not reproduced
in the other
life, but the spiritual things which are adjoined
to the
natural
things
by
correspondences
;
which
things,
nevertheless,
when they are presented
to the
sight, appear in a form altogether
like
that in the natural world
;
for
all things which appear
in
the
heavens, appear
in
like manner as
in
the world,
though
in
their
essence they are not natural,
but
spiritual,
as may be seen shown
in
the
chapter
on
representatives
and
appearances
in
heaven
(n.
170-175).
But
the
external
or
natural memory,
as
to
those
things
in
it
that are derived from what is material, and from time
and
space, and from
all
other
things proper
to
nature,
does not
serve the spirit
for that use in which
it had served
it
in
the world
;
for man

intellectual, thought naturally and not spiritually.
Yet in the other
life,
when
the
spirit
is
in
the
spiritual
world,
he does
not
think
naturally,
but
spiritually,
and
to
think
spiritually
is
to
think
intellectually
or
rationally.
Hence
it
is
that
the
external
or
natural
memory,
as
to
those
things
which
are
material,
is
then
quiescent,
and
those
things
only come
into
use
which man
has
imbibed
in
the world by means of material
things, and has made
rational."
H. H., 463, 464.
53 (p. 105).—"The speech of an angel or a spirit with man is heard
as sonorously as the speech of a man w ith a man
; yet
it is not heard by
others who stand near, but by himself alone
;
the reason
is, because
the speech of an angel
or spirit
flows
first into
the man's thought,
and by an
internal way
into
his organ of hearing, and
thus moves
that from within
; but the speech of man with man
flows
first into
the air, and by an external way into his organ of hearing, and moves
it from without.
Hence
it
is evident that the speech of an angel and
of a spirit with man
is heard
in man, and, because
it equally moves
the organs of hearing, that
it is also equally sonorous."—//. H., 248.

that he thinks
and
wills from
himself, though he does not do so
in the smallest
degree
; for thought and will cannot be so united to the recipient as to
be his own, jireciscly as the light and heat of the sun cannot be united
to a subject of the earth, and become, like
it, material.
But the light
and
heat of
life affect and
fill
the
recipient, i)reciselv according
to
the quality
of the acknowledgment
that they
are
not
his own, but
the
Lord's;
and
the
quality
of the acknowledgment
is
precisely
according
to
the
cjuality

of
the
state

interiors, so
that
progressions are
nothing else than changes of state.

these things
it may be
seen that, although in heaven there are spaces as
in
the world,
still
nothing
there
is estimated
according
to
spaces,
but according
to
states
; consequently that spaces cannot there be measured as in the
world, but only he seen from the state, and according to the state of
the interiors of the angels."
H. H., 191,
192,
198.
57 (p.
107).—" That there are many earths, and men upon them,
and spirits and angels from them,
is very well known in the other life
;
for it is granted to every one
there who from
the love of truth and
thence of use desires it, to speak
with
spirits of other earths, and to
be confirmed thereby
in
regard
to a
plurality of worlds, and to be
informed that the human race is not only from one earth,
but from
innumerable ones."
H. H., 417.
58 (p.
108).—" It is well known that the will and understanding
rule
the body
at
pleasure, for what
the understanding
thinks, the
mouth speaks
; and what the will wills, the body does.
From this it
is
plain
that the body is a form corresponding to the understanding
and will.
And because form also is predicated of understanding and
will,
it
is plain that the form of the body corresponds to the form of
the understanding and
will.
But
this
is not
the place to describe
the nature of these respective forms.
In each form there are things
innumerable
;
and
these,
on
either
side, act
as one, because they
mutually correspond.
It is from this that the mind (that
is, the will
and understanding)
rules the body
at
its beck,
thus as entirely as
it rules its own self.
From all this it follows that the interiors of the
mind act as one with the interiors of the body,
and the exteriors of
the mind with the exteriors of the body."
D. L.
IV.,

59 (p.
108).— " All things which exist in nature, from the least to
the greatest, are correspondences.
That they are correspondences
is
because the natural world,
with
all
things
in
it,
e.xists and subsists
from the spiritual world,
and both from the Divine.
It
is said that
it
also
subsists,
because everything
subsists from
that from which
it
exists,
for subsistence
is
perpetual
existence
;
and
because
not
anything can subsist from
itself,
but from something
prior to itself,
thus from
the
First
; from whom
therefore
if
it
be
separated,
it
utterly perishes and vanishes.
"All
that
is correspondent which
in
nature
exists and
subsists
from
divine
order.
The
divine
good,
which
proceeds
from
the

EXTRACTS FROM SWEDENBORC.
151
Lord, makes divine order
;
it begins from Him,
proceeds from Him
through the heavens successively
into
the world, and
is terminated
there in ultimates.
The things which are according
to order there
are
correspondences
;
and
all
things are according
to order
there
which are good and perfect for use, for ever)' good
is good according
to use
; form has relation to truth, because truth
is the form of good.
Thence it is that all things which are in the whole world, and in the
nature of the world, relate to good and truth."
H. H., 106,
107.
60 (p.
1 14).— " In each single word of the Word there is a spiritual
meaning from
the Divine wisdom, and a celestial from the Divine
love
; and these are perceived by angels when the Word is devoutly
read by man."
D. L.
IV., 280.
" I have sometimes spoken with angels about the Word, and said
that
it
is despised by some on account of
its simple style, and
that
nothing
at
all
is known about
its
internal sense, and
that
for
this
reason
it
is not
believed
that
so much wisdom lies concealed
in
it.
The angels said that the style of the Word, though
it appears simple
in
the sense
of the
letter,
is
still such
that nothing can
be
at
all
compared
to
it
in excellence, because divine wisdom lies concealed,
not
only in
the
entire
sense, but
also
in each word
; and that this
wisdom shines forth in heaven
; they wished to have
it said that
it
is
the
light of heaven,
because
it
is divine
truth, for
divine
truth in
heaven shines (see above,
n.
132).
They said also that without such
a Word there would be no light of heaven with the men of our earth,
thus neither would
there be conjunction of heaven with them
;
for
as
far
as
the
light
of heaven
is
present with man, so
far
there
is
conjunction, and
so
far
likewise divine
truth
is revealed
to him by
the Wonl.
The reason why man docs not know that this conjunction
is by the
spiritual
sense of the Word corresponding
to
its
natural
sense,
is because
the man
of
this earth does
not know anything
about the spiritual thought and speech of the angels, and
that
it
is
different from the natural
thought and speech of men
; and
unless
he knows this, he cannot at all know what the internal sense
is, and
that by
it
such conjunction can
be given.
They said
also
that
if
man knew
that
there
is
such
a
sense,
and
should
think
from
a
knowledge
of
it when
he reads
the Word,
he would come
into
interior wisdom, and would
be
still more
conjoined
with heaven,
since by
it he would enter into ideas similar to those of the angels."

; but in the heavens
it

THE
LIFE THAT LEADS TO
HEAVEN.
62 (p. 121).—" Some people believe that to live the life which leads
to heaven, which is called spiritual
life, is difficult, because they have
been told that man must renounce the world and deprive himself of
the lusts which
are
called
lusts
of the body and the flesh, and that
he must live spiritually.
And
these
things they do not understand
otherwise than that they must
reject worldly
things, which consist
chiefly in riches and honours
; that they must walk continually in pious
meditation about God, about salvation, and about
eternal life
; and
that they must spend their life in prayers and
in reading
the Word
and pious books.
This
they esteem
to
be renouncing
the world,
and living in the spirit and
not
in
the
flesh.
But
that the case
is
altogether
otherwise
it
has
been
given me
to know
by
much
experience, and from conversation with the angels
; and indeed that
they who renounce the world and live in the
spirit
in
this manner,
procure to themselves
a
sorrowful
life, which
is
not
receptive
of
heavenly joy
;
for with every one
his own
life remains.
But to the
intent that man may receive the
life of heaven,
it is quite necessary
that he live in the world and engage
in
its
business and employ-
ments, and that he then by moral and civil life receive spiritual life
;
and that spiritual
life cannot otherwise be formed with man, or his
spirit prepared for heaven.
For to live internal life and not external

EXTRACTS FROM SIVEDENBORG.
153
at the same time, is like dwcllinq in a liouse which has no foundation,
which gradually either sinks, or becomes full of chinks and breaches,
or totters
till
it falls."—//:
//., 528.
THE
MOTIVES OF
SPIRITUAL
LIVING.
" If the life of man be viewed and explored by rational intuition,
it
is discovered to be threefold, namely, spiritual
life, moral
life, and
civil
life, and those lives are distinct from each other.
The spiritual
man believes
in
the
Divine, and
he
acts
sincerely and
justly, not
merely because
it
is
according
to
civil and
moral
laws,
but
also
because
it
is
according
to
divine
laws.
For
the
spiritual
man,
inasmuch
as
he
thinks
about
divine
things
when
he
acts,
communicates with the angels of heaven, and as far as he does this,
he is conjoined with
them,
and
thus
his
internal man
is
opiened,
which viewed in itself is a spiritual man.
When man
is of such a
character, he is then adopted and
led by the Lord while he himself
is not aware of it, and then
in
doing
acts
of sincerity and
justice
which are
of moral and
civil
life, he
does them
from
a
spiritual
origin
; and to do what
is
sincere and
just from a spiritual
origin,
is
to do
it from
sincerity
and
justice
itself,
or
to
do
it from
the
heart.
His
justice
and
sincerity
in
the
external
form
appear
altogether like the justice and
sincerity with natural men, even with
evil and infernal men
;
but in the internal form they
are
altogether
dissimilar.
For
evil men
act
justly and
sincerely
merely
for
the
sake of themselves and the world
; and therefore
if they did not fear
the law and
its penalties, also the
loss
of reputation, of honour, of
gain, and of life, they would act
altogether insincerely and unjustly,
inasmuch
as
they
neither
fear God nor any
divine
law, and
are
not
restrained by
any
internal
bond.
They would
therefore
in
such
case
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
defraud,
plunder,
and
spoil
others,
and
this from
delight.
.
.
.
Although
such
a
person
does
not
commit
adultery,
still
because
he
believes
it
allowal)le,
he
is
perpetually
an
adulterer
;
for
as
far
as
he
can, and
as
often
as
it
is permitted, he commits
it.
Although he
docs
not
steal, ycl inasmuch
as he covets the goods of others, and
rigar<ls fraud and
evil
arts as not contrary
to law, in
intent
he
is
continually acting
the
thief.
The case is similar as to the precepts
of moral
life, which teach not to bear
false witness and not to covet
the goods of others.
.Such
is the character of every man who denies

1 54
APPENDIX I.
the Divine, and who
has
not
a conscience grounded
in
religion.
That such
is
his proper character appears manifestly from
similar
spirits
in
the other
life, when, on
the removal
of things
external,
they are let into their internals
; then, inasmuch as they are separated
from heaven, they act in unity with hell, and so are consociated with
those who are in hell.
It
is otherwise with those who have in heart
acknowledged the
Divine, and
in the acts
of their lives have had
respect
to divine
laws, and have acted according
to the
three
first
precepts of the decalogue equally
as according
to the
rest.
When
these, on the removal
of things external, are
let into their internals,
they are wiser than when
in
the world
;
for when they come into
their internals it
is like coming from shade into light, from ignorance
into wisdom, and from a sorrowful life into a blessed one, inasmuch
as they are in the Divine, thus in heaven.
These things are said to
the intent that the quality of the one and of the other may be known,
though both have lived a similar external life."

IMMAXUEL lOVNT'S LETTER ON SWEDENBORG
TO CHARLOTTE VON KNOBLOCH.*
" I would not have deprived myself so long of the honour and
pleasure of obeying the request of a lady who
is
the ornament of
her
sex,
in
communicating
the
desired
information,
if
I
had
not
deemed
it necessary previously to inform myself thoroughly concern-
ing the subject of your request.
.
.
.
Permit me, gracious lady, to
justify my proceedings in this matter, inasmuch
as
it might appear
that an erroneous
opinion
had
induced me
to
credit
the
various
relations
concerning
it
without
careful
examination.
I am
not
aware that anybody
has ever perceived
in me an
inclinatic^n
to the
marvellous, or a weakness tending to credulity.
So much
is certain
that, notwithstanding
all
the
narrations of apparitions and
visions
concerning the sjiirilual world, of which a great numlxrr of the most
probable are known to me,
I have always considered
it to be most
in agreement with sound reason to incline to the negative side
;
not
as if I had imagined such a case to be impossible, although we know
but
very
little concerning
the nature
of
a
spirit, but
because
the
instances are not in general
sufficiently proved.
There arise, more-
over,
from
the
incomprehensibility
and
inutility
of
this
sort
of
phenomena, too many difiiculties
; and there are, on the other hand,
so many
proofs
of
deception,
that
I
have
never
considered
it
necessary
to
suffer
fear
or dread
to come upon me, either
in
the
cemeteries of the dead
or in the darkness of the night.
This is the
position
in which my mind stood
for a long time, until
the report
concerning Swcdenborg came to my notice.

APPENDIX IL
"This account
I received from a Danish officer, who was formerly
my friend, and attended my lectures
; and who,
at
the
table of the
Austrian Ambassador,
Dietrichstein,
at Copenhagen, tc^ether with
several
other
guests,
read
a
letter which
the Ambassador
about
that time had
received
from Baron de Lutzow,
the Mecklenburg
Ambassador
in Stockholm,
in which he says
that
he,
in company
with
the Dutch Ambassador, was present at the Queen of Sweden's
residence
at
the extraordinary transaction
respecting Swedenborg,
which your ladyship will undoubtedly have heard.
The authenticity
thus
given
to
the account
surprised me.
For
it can
scarcely be
believed,
that one Ambassador should communicate to another
for
public use a piece of information which
related to the Queen of the
Court where
he
resided,
and which
he
himself,
together
with
a
distinguished company, had the opportunity of witnessing
if
it were
not
true.
Now, in order not to reject blindfold the prejudice against
apparitions and visions by a new prejudice,
I found
it
desirable to
inform myself as to the particulars of this surprising transaction.
I
accordingly wrote to the officer
I have mentioned,
at Copenhagen,
and made various inquiries respecting
it.
He answered that he had
again
had an
interview concerning
it
with
Count
Dietrichstein
that the
affair had really taken
place in the manner described
; and
that
Professor Schlegel, also, had declared to him that
it could by
no means be doubted.
He advised me, as he was then going to the
army under General
St. Germain,
to write
to Swedenborg himself,
in order to ascertain the particular circumstances of this extraordinary
case.
I then wrote to this singular man, and the letter was delivered
to
him,
in
Stockholm,
by
an
English
merchant.
Information
was sent
here,
that Swedenborg
politely
received the
letter, and
promised
to
answer
it,
but
the
answer
was
omitted.
In
the
meantime
I made the acquaintance of a
highly-educated
English
gentleman who
spent
the
last summer
at
this
place, and whom,
relying
on
the
friendship
we
had
formed,
I
commissioned,
as
he
was
going
to
Stockholm,
to
make
particular
inquiries
regarding the miraculous gifts which Swedenborg is said to possess.
In
his
first
letter,
he
states
that
the
most
respectable
people
in
Stockholm declare that the singular transaction alluded to happened
in the manner you have heard described by me.
He had not then
had an interview with Swedenborg,
but hoped soon to embrace the
opportunity
;
although he found it difficult to persuade himself that

A'ANTS LETTER ON SIVEDENBORG.
157
all could be
true, which
the most reasonable
persons
of
the
city
asserted,
respecting
his
secret
communication
with
the
spiritual
world.
But his succeeding
letters were (juite of a different purport.
He had
not
only spoken
with Swedenborg
himself,
but had also
visited him at his house
; and he is now in the greatest astonishment
respecting such
a remarkable
case.
Swedenborg
is a
reasonalile,
polite, and open-hearted man
;
he
is also a man
of learning
; and
my friend has promised
to send me some of his writings in a short
time.
He
told
this
gentleman,
without
reserve,
that God
had
accorded
to
him
this
remarkable
gift
of
conmumicating
with
departed
souls
at
his
pleasure.
In proof of
this he appealed
to
certain well-known
facts.
As he was reminded of my
letter,
he
said that he was aware
that he had
received
it, and that he would
already have answered
it had he not intended to make the whole of
this singular
affair
public
before the eyes of the world,
lie would
proceed to London in the month of May
this year, where he would
publish
a
lx)ok
in which an answer
to my
letter
in
every
point
might be met with.
" In order, gracious
lady,
to give you two proofs,
of which
the
present
existing
public
is
a
witness, and
the person who
related
them
to me had
the opportunity of investigating them at the very
place where they occurred,
I
will
narrate to you the two following
occurrences.
" Madame
Herteville
(Martevillc),
the
widow
of
the
Dutch
Ambassador in Stockholm, some time after the death of her husband,
was
called
up<jn
by
Croon,
a
goldsmith,
to
pay
for
a
silver
service
which
her
husband
had
purchased
from
him.
The
widow
was
convinced
that
her
late
husband
had
been
much
too
precise
and
orderly
not
to
have
paid
this
debt,
yet
she
was
unable
to
find
this
receipt.
In
her
sorrow, and
because
the amount was
considerable,
she
requested
Mr. Swedenl)()rg to call at her house.
After apologizing to him
for
troubling him, she said
that
if, as
all people
say, he
p<:)sscssed
the
extraordinary gift of conversing with the souls of the departed, he
would perhaps have
the kindness to ask
her husband huw
it was
about the silver service.
.Swedeni)org did not at
all object to comply
with her request.
Three d.iys afterward the said lady had company
at her house
for
coffee.
Swedenborg
called and
in
his cool way
informed her that he had conversed with
her husband.
The debt

158
APPENDIX II.
had been paid several months before his decease, and the receipt was
in a bureau in the room upstairs.
The lady replied that the bureau
had been quite cleared out, and that the receipt was not found among
all the papers.
Swedenborg said that her husband had described to
him, how after pulling out the lefthand drawer a board would appear,
which required to be drawn out, when a secret compartment would
be disclosed, containing his
private Dutch correspondence,
as
well
as the receipt.
Upon hearing this description
the whole company
arose and accompanied the lady into the room upstairs.
The bureau
was opened
;
they did as they were directed
;
the compartment was
found, of which no one had
ever known before
;
and
to the great
astonishment of all, the papers were discovered there, in accordance
with his description.
"The following occurrence appears
to me
to have
the greatest
weight of proof, and to place the assertion respecting Swedenborg's
extraordinary gift beyond all possibility of doubt.
" In the year 1759, towards the end of September, on Saturday
at
four
o'clock
p.m.,
.Swedenborg
arrived
at
Gottenburg
from
England,
when
Mr.
William
Castel
invited
him
to
his
house,
together with a party of fifteen persons.
About six o'clock Sweden-
borg went out, and returned to the company quite pale and alarmed.
He said
that a dangerous fire had just broken out in Stockholm, at
the Sodermalm (Gottenburg is about fifty (}erman miles from Stock-
holm), and
that
it was spreading very
fast.
He was
restless, and
went out often.
He said that the house of one of his friends, whom
he named, was already in ashes, and
that
his own was
in danger.
At eight o'clock, after he had been out again, he joyfully exclaimed,
' Thank God
!
the
fire
is extinguished
;
the
third door from my
house.'
This news
occasioned
great commotion
throughout
the
whole city, but particularly amongst
the company in which he was.
It was announced
to the Governor
the same evening.
On Sunday
morning Swedenborg was summoned to the Governor who questioned
him concerning
the
disaster.
Swedenborg described the fire
pre-
cisely, how
it had begim and
in what manner
it had
ceased, and
how long
it had
continued.
On
the same day the news spread
through the city, and as the Governor thought
it worthy of attention,
the consternation was considerably
increased
; because many were
in
trouble on account
of their
friends and
property, which might
have been involved in the disaster.
On Monday evening a messenger

KANTS LETTER ON SWEDENBORG.
159
arrived al Gottenburg, who was despatched by the Board
of Trade
during the time of the
fire.
In the letters brought by him, the fire
was described precisely
in
llic manner stated by Swedenborg.
On
Tuesday morning the Royal Courier arrived at the Governor's with
the
melancholy
intelligence
of the
fire,
of the
loss which
it
had
occasioned, and of the houses
it had damaged and ruined, not in the
least
differing from
that which Swedenborg had given
at
the very
time when
it happened
;
for
the
fire was
extinguished
at
eight
o'clock.
" What can
be brought forward
against the authenticity of this
occurrence (the conflagration in Stockholm) ?
My friend who wrote
this to me has examined all, not only in Stockholm, but also, about
two months ago, in Gottenburg, where he
is well acquainted with
the most respectable
houses, and where he could obtain
the most
authentic and complete information, for as only a
ver)' short time
has elapsed
since
1759, most of the inhabitants are
still
alive who
were eye-witnesses of
this occurrence.
He
has also given me an
account of the manner in which, according
to Mr. Swedenborg, his
intercourse with other
spirits takes
place, and
also
the ideas which
he communicates regarding the condition of departed
spirits.
This
portrait
is remarkable, but time
fails me to describe
it.
How
I wish
that
I
might have questioned
this remarkable man
myself, for my
friend
is not so
proficient in method as
to ask just those questions
which would throw
the most
light on
the
subject.
I await with
longing
the book
that Swedenborg
is about to publish in London.
I have made every provision for receiving
it as soon as
it shall leave
the press.
" This
is as much as
I can do up to the present in satisfying your
worthy desire.
I do not know, gracious lady, whether you care to
know what judgment
I would pronounce on
so slippery a matter.
Much greater talents than
the small one
allowed to me have been
able to arrive at
little that
is
reliable.
Still, whatever may be
the
worth of my ojiinion
I shall feel myself bound
to conmiunicate
it to
you in writing,
if you remain
in
the
country, and
I
cannot
confer
with you in person.
I regret to have abused the privilege of writing
to you
in
detaining you
too
long
with
this
hasty and awkward
epistle, and am with deepest respect, &.C.,

^^^ former
editor favours 1763, the
latter 1758, as the true date.
Inasmuch as
several events mentioned
in
the letter occurred,
as
all now agree,
subsequent
to
1758, that date may be regarded as now set
aside by
universal consent.
The circumstance that Kant speaks in the letter
of being entirely unacquainted with Swedenborg's writings, whereas
in the "Dreams" he professes to have read the Arcana through, would
seem to favour a date for the letter considerably prior to
that of the
"Dreams," 1766.
On the other hand, the mention in the letter of
Swedenborg's
intended
journey
to
London
the
"next
year"
to
publish
a volume which would answer Kant's
inquiries, a journey
actually made
in
1769, when
the work on
the "Two Worlds,"
De Commercio, was brought out discussing the theories of Aristotle,
Descartes and
Leibnitz, this also being Swedenborg's only journey
to London
since
1761, would seem
to be strong evidence in favour
of
1768.
Against
this conclusion,
however, may be brought
the
fatal circumstance
that
Fraiilein von Knobloch was married
in
the
year
1763
or
1764
to a General von Klingshorn, and hence could
hardly have been addressed
in 1768 under her maiden name.
(See
Reclam ed.
p. 32.)
As to the significance of the date as bearing upon the question of
Kant's final estimate of Swedenborg's philosophy of the two worlds
I think
it has been much over-rated,
for the two following reasons
:
I. That the humorous and
flippant style of the " Dreams"
forbid
our attaching very
serious
weight
to anything whether of
fact
or

/CANT'S ''LETTER" AND THE "DREAMS."
i6l
opinion alleged
therein
;
II. The
true
and
sufficient
evidence of
Swedenhorg's
influence
on Kant
is
unmistakaljly
shown
in
his
Inaugural
Dissertation on
the Two Worlds
written
in
1770,
the
year following the puljlication
of Swedenhorg's De Commercio, and
in subsequent
lectures on
Metaphysics and
Psychology which have
recently been
edited by Du
Prel and
Heinze.

IV.
KANT'S PRIVATE AND PUBLIC OPINION
OF SWEDENBORG.
"The
opinion
expressed
by
Swedenborg's
editor,
Dr.
J.
F.
Immanuel
Tafe), of the
University of Tubingen, in the Sammlung
von Urkunden,
iv., 2jj, that
it was Kant's
fear of ridicule among
his
philosophical
colleagues
that
led
him
to
affect
so
trifling an
attitude toward an author who had
in
reality deeply and
lastingly
impressed him, seems
to be borne out by the passages quoted by
Tafel from Kant's letter to Moses Mendelssohn.*
Kant on Swedenborg in Lettkrs to Moses Mendelssohn,
From the letter of February 7th, 1766.
" I have
sent you by
post some
' Traumereien,' and beg most
respectfully that after retaining a copy yourself,
if you so please, you
will send the others to the Court-Preacher Sack, to the Councillor of
the
Consistory
Spaulding,
to
Pro%ost
Susmilch,
to
Professors
Lambert, Sultzer, and Formey.
It
is a
hastily
prepared
treatise,
and
presents rather an outline of the manner in which questions of
this kind may be treated than the treatment itself."
From the letter of April 8th, 1766.
"As a matter
of
fact
it would be difficult
for me
to conceive of
a method of so clothing my thoughts that
I shall not subject myself
to ridicule.
It seemed to me the wisest course to take advantage of
others and first do the
ridiculing myself; and
in
this
I have been
perfectly frank since the
attitude
of my own mind
is
inconsistent
and, so far as these
stories
are
concerned,
I cannot help having a
slight inclination for things of this kind, and indeed, as regards their
reasonableness,
I cannot
help cherishing an
opinion
that there
is
some
validity
in
these experiences
in
spite
of
all
the
absurdities
involved in the stories about them, and
the
crazy and unintelligible
ideas which deprive them of their real value."
