Quantum mechanics gives a unique characterization of elementary particles as be-
ing either bosons or fermions. This property, referred to as the  quantum statistics
of the particles, follows from a simple symmetry argument, where the  wave func-
tions of a system of identical particles are restricted to be either symmetric (bosons)
or antisymmetric (fermions) under permutation of particle coordinates. For two
spinless particles, this symmetry is expressed through a sign factor which is as-
sociated with the switching of positions
ψ(r1, r2) = ±ψ(r2, r1) ,
(1)
with + for bosons and −for fermions. From the symmetry constraint, when ap-
plied to a many-particle system, the statistical distributions of particles over single
particle states can be derived, and the completely different collective behaviour of
systems like  electrons (fermions) and photons (bosons) ( light quantum) can be
understood.
