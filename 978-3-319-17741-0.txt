About this Series
The Emergence, Complexity and Computation (ECC) series publishes new devel-
opments, advancements and selected topics in the ﬁelds of complexity, computation
and emergence. The series focuses on all aspects of reality-based computation ap-
proaches from an interdisciplinary point of view especially from applied sciences,
biology, physics, or Chemistry. It presents new ideas and interdisciplinary insight
on the mutual intersection of subareas of computation, complexity and emergence
and its impact and limits to any computing based on physical limits (thermodynamic
and quantum limits, Bremermann’s limit, Seth Lloyd limits...) as well as algorith-
mic limits (Gödel’s proof and its impact on calculation, algorithmic complexity,
the Chaitin’s Omega number and Kolmogorov complexity, non-traditional calcula-
tions like Turing machine process and its consequences,...) and limitations arising
in artiﬁcial intelligence ﬁeld. The topics are (but not limited to) membrane comput-
ing, DNA computing, immune computing, quantum computing, swarm computing,
analogic computing, chaos computing and computing on the edge of chaos, com-
putational aspects of dynamics of complex systems (systems with self-organization,
multiagent systems, cellular automata, artiﬁcial life,...), emergence of complex sys-
tems and its computational aspects, and agent based computation. The main aim of
this series is to discuss the above mentioned topics from an interdisciplinary point
of view and present new ideas coming from mutual intersection of classical as well
as modern methods of computation. Within the scope of the series are monographs,
lecture notes, selected contributions from specialized conferences and workshops,
special contribution from international experts.

Preface 
It has been widely recognised that the power-flow analysis (PFA), or the energy-
flow analysis (EFA) and or the statistical energy analysis (SEA) provides a 
technique able to model the high-frequency dynamic responses of structural or 
fluid dynamical systems of high modal density. The fundamental concepts of PFA 
were discussed by Goyder & White (1980abc), whereas an ASME special 
publication NCA-3: statistical energy analysis edited by Hsu, Nefske & Akay 
(1987), Fahy’s (1994) comprehensive critical review of SEA, an monograph by 
Price & Keane (1994) and an IUTAM symposium on SEA (Fahy & Price 1998) 
highlighted its origins, developments, applications, significant advances and 
possible future directions. The interested reader may wish to consult these 
important historical publications for more valuable references with important 
practical techniques.  
The energy flow approach provides a fundamental basis to investigate dynamic 
systems, for which we may summary the following essential points. The principle 
used in this method is based on the universal law on energy conservation and 
transformation to investigate dynamic systems, therefore, it provides a common 
approach to analyse various types of systems including mechanical, thermal and 
electrical / magnetic ones, such as solid, fluid, acoustic and control systems, as 
well as more complex systems involving their couplings or interactions. The 
variable studied in the power flow analysis combines the effects from both forces 
and velocities, and it takes their product, power, i.e. the change rate of energy, as a 
single parameter to characterise / to describe the dynamic behaviour and responses 
of a system, which includes and reflects the full information on the equilibrium 
and motion of the system, and therefore overcomes the limitations to study force 
and motion responses separately. The approaches adopted in power flow analysis 
focus on a global statistical energy estimations, distributions, transmissions, 
designs and controls for dynamic systems or sub-systems rather than the detailed 
spatial pattern of the structural responses. It overcomes difficulties encountered 
while using finite element methods or experimental modal analyses of vibration 
responses at medium to high frequency regions, which requires extreme small size 
of elements to reach a necessary computational accuracy. The applications are 
quite wide as described in the short review on this method given in Chapter 1. 
Recently, the more and more increasing interests for scientists and engineers to 
study nonlinear dynamical systems (NDS) may be due to the following main 
reasons. Firstly, practical engineering systems are inherently nonlinear ones, so 
that in some cases linear assumptions and analyses have hidden some important 

VI 
Preface
 
phenomena and provided no accurate results, and therefore nonlinear analyses are 
necessary. Secondly, with the extreme fast developments of modern computers 
associated with computational methods and software, many complex nonlinear 
problems failed to be solved before due to pour computation capacities, can now 
be tackled. Thirdly, a most important reason, it has been demonstrated that for 
many dynamical systems, introductions of nonlinear members can significantly 
improve the performance of the system. For example, i) nonlinear suspension / 
isolation systems can provide extremely low or extremely high dynamic 
supporting stiffness and much better performance which were unable to be 
realised by linear systems; ii) possible periodical solutions and harmful flutter 
phenomenon existing in  nonlinear oscillators offer more possibilities to design 
effective wave / wind energy harvesting devices.  
Based on the above theoretical and practical bases, it has been shown a growing 
interest to use the energy flow approach developed from the universal law of 
energy conservation and transformation in the world to investigate nonlinear 
dynamical systems and to reveal their possible energy flow behaviour. The 
searched limited references reported for NDS are mentioned in Chapter 1 and 
listed in the References. While reading these available publications on the power 
flows of NDS, we have noted that all of them just follow the definitions of energy 
flow variables in linear systems, such as physical kinetic, potential and damping-
dissipated energies, which is difficult to be identified in the governing equations 
of NDS due to couplings of unknown variables in some terms, so that we cannot 
separate the kinetic, potential and dissipated energies. This suggests that we have 
to find more suitable energy flow variables suitable to investigate generalised 
NDS. Furthermore, it is generally sufficient to regard any NDS as a set of first 
order-differential equations in a form of vector field defined in a phase space; 
therefore, it is necessary to create a suitable energy flow theory to deal with NDS 
based on the vector field form.  
The main aim of this monograph is to develop an energy flow theory and 
approach for nonlinear dynamical systems to address the above difficulties. For 
this purpose, it would be useful to compare NDS with linear ones to realise the 
main differences. The first well-known difference is that the solutions of a 
nonlinear dynamical system are not unique, and therefore at some points on the 
solution orbit, there may appear branches, bifurcations. The second obvious 
difference is that the “frequency reservation” for linear systems is not valid, so 
that a harmonic force of frequencyΩ  applied to a nonlinear system might excite 
the dynamic responses with difference frequencies. Moreover, the amplitude of 
nonlinear dynamic response will not be proportional to the amplitude of the force 
as valid for linear systems. The third difference behaviour concerns possible 
periodical motions. For a linear system in a periodical motion, the averaged time 
change rate of kinetic and potential energies over the time period respectively 
vanish. This implies that the kinetic energy and the potential energy are 
respectively conservative in the time period and the work done by the force in the 
period is totally dissipated by the damping of the system. This conclusion is not 
generally valid for periodical motions of nonlinear systems. Due to the couplings 
of dynamic variables in each term of equation, the work done by each term in the 

Preface 
VII
 
period normally does not vanish, although the total work done by all terms of 
equation vanishes for periodical motions. This implies that in the time period, 
energy exchanges between the terms happen. Finally, chaotic motions have been 
observed for many nonlinear systems, which are very sensitive to the changes of 
the system parameters. Those different characteristics of NDS must cause the 
corresponding changes of the energy flows of the system.  
This monograph intends to investigate these differences using the proposed 
energy flow method and to reveal the related energy flow phenomena and 
mechanism of NDS. Three scalar energy flow variables based on the vector field 
equations of nonlinear dynamical systems in the phase space are defined. These 
are the generalised potential energy relating to the position of a point in the phase 
space, the generalised kinetic energy involving the tangent vector of the solution 
orbit, and the generalised force power reflecting the energy flow of the system, i.e. 
the time change rate of the generalised potential energy. The generalised potential 
and kinetic energies are two real numbers embedded into the phase space to build 
the basis to investigate the energy flow characteristics of NDS governed by 
generalised vector field equations. Obviously, in general, these three variables are 
not the corresponding physical energies for the equation in phase space, therefore 
we use the word, “generalised”, to distinguish them throughout the texts.  
This monograph consists of 10 Chapters. Chapter 1 is the introduction, which 
gives the energy flow equations for some linear dynamical systems: 1-DOF 
system, n-DOF system, continuum system, structural members (rods, shafts, 
Timoshenko beams and shear plates) as well as electromagnetic fields, from which 
some definitions of the notations and terminologies that are used in the rest of the 
monograph are given and explained. Following these fundamental equations, a 
short review on current state of energy flow or power flow analyses is presented, 
which summaries the successful approaches developed for power flow analyses of 
linear systems with their applications. The limited publications involving 
nonlinear dynamical systems are also reviewed. Characteristics of energy flow 
analysis are described, which confirms it is a universal approach to investigate any 
dynamical systems in science and engineering fields. From a comparison of linear 
and nonlinear problems as well as their mathematical formulations, limitations of 
energy flow variables defined in linear analyses are mentioned. To overcome these 
limitations, it is proposed an initial idea to define some new energy flow variables 
suitable to investigate energy flows of nonlinear systems governed by the 
equations of vector field in the phase space by using a simple example, which 
would be easily understood by those readers who are not familiar with power flow 
approaches. Chapter 2 gives the fundamental knowledge on dynamical systems 
and differential equations in vector field forms defined in the phase space, which 
outlines the generalised problems and equations to be tackled using energy flow 
approach in this monograph. Chapter 3 presents the proposed energy flow theory 
for nonlinear dynamical systems governed by the vector field equations in the 
phase space, in which the two positive energy flow variables: generalised potential 
and kinetic energies are defined and embedded into the phase space. These two 
positive real variables directly link with the position and its tangent vector of a 
phase point on the orbit of a nonlinear dynamical system, which provides an

energy flow approach to reveal the behaviour of the system. The energy flow 
equation, energy flow field and its geometrical characteristics in the vector field 
are defined and its variations with respect to time and space points are formulated. 
Chapter 4 gives some energy flow theorems to investigate the stability about a 
fixed point as well as the possible periodical orbits of nonlinear dynamical 
systems using the developed energy flow variables. Chapter 5 presents the first 
order approximation formulations of the energy flow equation, in which there four 
spaces: Jacobian, energy flow, kinetic energy and spin spaces with the 
corresponding matrices are defined, which can be used to investigate nonlinear 
dynamical systems based on the first order approximation equations. Chapter 6 
discusses the energy flow characteristics of local bifurcations, where a central 
energy flow theorem is presented and 5 types of local bifurcations: simplest 
bifurcations of equilibria, saddle-node bifurcation, transcritical, pitchfork and 
Hopf bifurcations are investigated. Chapter 7 investigates the global bifurcations 
including saddle connections, Hopf bifurcation and Lorenz equation. Chapter 8 
reveals energy flow characteristics of chaos, in which the energy flow 
characteristic factors are used to study Lorenz and Rössler systems. The behaviour 
of time average energy flow in chaotic motions is observed by numerical solutions 
of 5 nonlinear systems: Forced Van der Pol’s, Lorenz and Duffing’s equations, as 
well as Rössler and SD attractors. Chapter 9 discusses the Hamiltonian System, in 
which its energy flow equation and canonical transformation are studied from the 
energy flow point of view. The final Chapter 10 provides a numerical solution 
approach and the corresponding Matlab code for the energy flow analyses of 
nonlinear dynamical systems, which can be used to solve various nonlinear 
dynamical equations. The defined functions used in the code, the main program 
code and some input and output files for examples are provided in the Appendices 
for readers to learn running the developed program quickly. 
Throughout the monograph the author continually return to some examples in 
each chapter and has tried to illustrate even the most abstract results, from which 
to demonstrate the developed theory and approaches as well as applications. For 
the references, the author makes no claims for the completeness of the listed 
publications, however, he has tried to include the bulk of the papers, monographs 
and books which have been proved useful to the author and his colleagues, but he 
recognises that his bias probably makes this a rather eclectic selection, especially 
the papers by the author and his colleagues in the collaboration researches on 
Power Flow Analysis. The author also makes no claims for the completeness, 
mathematical accuracy and logicality of the proposed theory and approaches, but 
he would be very happy if the proposed ideas, which seems like a child casually 
picked up a cheapest brick from the surface of ground, might attract the interested 
readers including scientists, mathematicians, engineers and hopeful young 
students continuously to dig out more valuable jades underneath the ground. The 
author deeply welcomes any comments, suggestions and corrections for the 
monograph from those readers who will read this book, and express his thanks to 
them in advance. 
The author would like to give his thanks to the Faculty of Engineering and 
Environment, the University of Southampton for awarding him an Emeritus

Chapter 1 
Introduction  
In this introductory chapter to explain and understand the concept of energy flows 
or power flows for various dynamical systems and its characteristics, we discuss 
some energy flow equations and their physical meanings developed for linear sys-
tems. Starting from a simple 1-DOF system consisting of a mass, a spring and a 
damper, we derive its energy flow balance equation and introduce the correspond-
ing terms and concepts used in power flow analysis, and then we directly extend 
them into n-DOF system. Furthermore, the developed energy flow equations and 
their physical explanations for continuum systems, structural members and elec-
tromagnetic fields are presented. Following the description of above fundamental 
knowledge, a comprehensive review on power flow analysis is given, in which the 
main characteristics, original history and developments, fundamental approaches 
with applications of power flow analysis for linear dynamic systems are described. 
Recent applications and publications on power flow analysis to nonlinear systems 
are given. 
Based on above discussions, it is realised that current energy flow variables de-
fined for linear physical dynamical systems are inconvenience to investigate non-
linear dynamical systems formulated in the form of vector fields in the phase 
space. To address these inconveniences, the 1-DOF system is again studied but in 
the phase space, from which the generalised potential and kinetic energies for a 
generalised nonlinear differential equation in the vector field form of phase space 
are proposed. These two generalised energy flow variables are the two scalars re-
spectively linking with the position vector of phase space and the corresponding 
tangent vector of the vector field of nonlinear dynamical system, from which a  
generalised energy flow theory, based on vector field equations of nonlinear dy-
namical system, is proposed. The main aim of this monograph is to develop this 
theory and to use it to investigate some nonlinear systems in order to reveal their 
nonlinear behaviour from the view of energy flow point. 
1.1 
Energy Flow Equation of 1-DOF System

gree of freedom (1-DOF), as shown by Fig. 1.1. Taking the static equilibrium

The variables

tem at the initial time t = 0, respectively. Due to the excitation of the force, the 
displacement x , velocity x and acceleration x of the mass are functions of time t. 
For a practical physical system, these dynamical variables are real numbers.

Physically, K  and Π  represent the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the 
system, D denotes the energy dissipated by the damping force and P is the power 
of the external force, i.e. the work done by the external force per second. There-
fore, Eq. 1.3 implies that the input power into the system by the external force 
equals the time change rates of the mechanical energy, i.e. the sum of kinetic and 
potential energies, and the energy dissipation rate by the damping force of the sys-
tem. More generally, Eq. 1.3 gives a particular form of the universal law of energy 
conservation for this 1-D dynamic system.

placement and the velocity of the free vibration of the system are decreased in the

Energy Flow Equation of 1-DOF System

The decreased mechanical energy is dissipated by the damping of the system. The 
dissipated rate depends only on the non-dimensional damping coefficient. If there 
is no damping in the system, the initial mechanical energy of the system is not 
changed and the system undergoes a natural harmonic vibration of frequencyΩ .

                                               (1.13) 
the general solution of Eq. 1.1 consists of two parts, one is the free vibration and 
another is a forced vibration, i.e. a particular solution of Eq. 1.1. Due to the damp-
ing of the system, the free vibration is gradually reduced to zero with time, as dis-
cussed in subsection 1.1.3, so that the forced one is more interested for practical 
applications of vibration analysis.  
     For linear systems, the forced vibration will be a harmonic oscillation with the 
same frequency ω  as the one of external force, which is called as the “frequency 
reservation” characteristic of linear systems. For a convenience to derive the 
forced vibration of Eq. 1.1 with discussions late, we may rewrite Eq. 1.1 asso-
ciated with Eq. 1.13 into the form

Here, ψ is called the amplifying factor of amplitude, which represents the ratio of 
the amplitude

of forced vibration over the static displacement 
0
X of the 
spring, and is dependent of the frequency ratio ζ and the damping coefficient 
η of the system. Now the dynamic equation satisfied by the force vibration in  
Eq. 1.20 can be represented as

in which the first term on the left hand side represents the difference between the 
spring force and the inertial force of the system, while the second term is the 
damping force.  
Based on this solution, we can now investigate the energy transmission and ex-
changes in the system undergoing the forced vibration. Multiplying the both sides 
of Eq. 1.14 by the velocity
fx in Eq. 1.20, we derive the time change rates of  
potential, kinetic and dissipated energies and the power of the external force, as 
denoted in Eq. 1.3, in the forms

the system to increase the potential energy of the spring; while in the time when 
the displacement decreases, the potential energy of the spring reduces, which  
restore the energy into the force source with the potential energy unchanged in one 
time period

where, the wave notation “~” over a variable denotes a complex variable. It is im-
portant to remember that for the complex Eq. 1.31, all variables of its solution are 
complex numbers of which their real (or imaginary if chosen) parts represent the 
corresponding real physical variables, respectively (see, for example, Pippard 
1978). The adoption of a complex representation of a harmonic quantity allows for 
mathematical flexibility, but it is noted that with some mathematical operations 
the instantaneous real or imaginary part only carries physical meaning. In such 
circumstances, in general, the safe course of action is to take the real or imaginary 
part of the quantity at the outset before any operation is performed. Therefore, 
when we calculate the energy flow quantities defined for the real physical va-
riables by Eq. 1.3, we have to use their complex-valued mathematical counterparts 
to do multiplications. For example, as adopted in this book, we assume that the 
real part of a complex variable denotes the real physical variable. The complex  
velocity of the solution of Eq. 1.31 can be represented as

From above results, we can find that Eq. 1.36 obtained by multiplying two com-
plex variables does not give the real power and its time-averaged power done by 
the real force through the real velocity. However, the time averaged power in  
Eq. 1.35 can be obtained by using the complex force and velocity based on the 
formulation

Energy Flow Equation of Linear Continuum System 
For a linear dynamical continuum system, Xing & Price (1999) presented the fun-
damental theory to investigate the power flow behaviour of the system, in which 
the energy flow equations for structures, such as rods, shafts, beams and plats, are 
given. A summary of these equations is given herein, of which the detailed ma-
thematical derivation may be consulted the above original reference. To develop 
the necessary energy flow equations describing the dynamics of the continuum, a 
standard Cartesian tensor notation and a summation convention are used herein 
(Fung, 1977). Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1.2, let

If this information is known for every particle in the body, the history of the  
motion of the whole body is quantified. Mathematically, Eq. 1.48 defines the

1.3.1 Energy Flow Density Vector 
The energy transmission from one part to another in a continuum excited by ex-
ternal forces can be investigated by analysing the energy flow across the closed 
surface s within the continuum B illustrated in Fig. 1.2. Let 
s
Δ  denote an ele-
mental surface on s and 
iν a unit normal to s
Δ with its positive direction pointing 
outward from the (negative) interior to the (positive) exterior. The interactions be-
tween material lying on either side of this surface cause internal actions defined by 
the traction or stress vector 
ν
iT representing the force per unit area acting on the 
surface s. Through the rate of work done by this traction

A positive value of 
νq  represents the transmission of energy per unit time 
through the unit area of 
s
Δ from the material within s to the outside. It follows 
from Cauchy’s formula (see, for example, Fung 1977) that the traction

determination of the rate of energy flow at each point in or on the continuum in 
any direction with unit normal 
iν  by the expression given in Eq. 1.55.  
The energy-flow vector

An energy-flow line is defined as a line in the direction of the energy flow in the 
continuum, and satisfies the differential equations

These energy-flow lines are the vector lines of the vector field of the energy-flow 
density 
jq and give a geometrical description of the energy flow field. Based on 
this theory, the energy-flow lines for many dynamic systems have been given, see 
for examples, Xing, Price & Wang (2002); Xing, Price & Xiong (2003); Xing, 
Xiong & Price (2004); Wang (2002); Wang , Xing & Price (2002ab, 2004).

As same as Eq. 1.23 given for 1-DOF system, for the forced vibration excited 
by a harmonic external force, the averaged time change rates of kinetic / potential 
energies of continuum system in a time period of the force also vanish, i.e.

coming velocity of fluid boundary is given by 
ivˆ and its traction force equaling the 
atmosphere pressure

rod in tension or compression, rod in torsion, Timoshenko beam and shear plate, 
are listed as follows.

equations describing the linear dynamics of a Voigt visco-elastic (see, for

Here, the subscripts α  and β  take values 1 or 2 and the summation convention 
for repeated subscript applies. For example, the plate-stress-resultants are denoted 
by the transverse shear force

 per unit length, with their

 etc. The bending stiffness of the plate is 
represented by D~ . The motion of the plate is investigated by the deflection w  and 
sharing angle ψ of its mid-plane of the unit outward normal vector 
α
ν
and  
the unit tangent vector

1.6.1 Characteristics of Power Flow Analysis 
The energy flow balance equations presented in sections 1.1-1.5 provide a funda-
mental basis to investigate dynamic systems using a power flow analysis  
approach, for which we may summary the following essential points.  
 
The principle used in this method is based on the universal principle of energy 
balance and conservation law to investigate dynamic systems and, therefore,  
it provides a common approach to analysis various systems including mechanical, 
thermal and electrical / magnetic systems, such as solid, fluid, acoustic and  
control systems, as well as more complex systems involving their couplings or  
interactions.  
 
The variable studied in the power flow analysis combines the effects from both 
forces and velocities, and it takes their product, power, i.e. the change rate of 
energy, as a single parameter to characterise / describe the dynamic behaviour and 
responses of a system, which includes and reflects the full information on the 
equilibrium and motion of the system, and therefore overcomes the limitations to 
study force and motion responses separately. For example, designs relying on the 
strength criteria of maximum stress can guarantee the maximum stress being in  
the allowable range, but the maximum displacement, stiffness behaviour, of the 
designed product might not be satisfied. In reverse cases, designs following  
the strength criteria of maximum strain can keep the stiffness characteristics  
satisfied, but the maximum stress of the designed product might be higher that the 
allowable one.  
 
The approaches adopted in power flow analysis focuses on a global statistical 
energy estimations, distributions, transmissions, designs and controls for dynamic 
systems or sub-systems rather than the detailed spatial pattern of the structural

responses. It overcomes difficulties encountered while using finite element me-
thods or experimental modal analyses of vibration responses at medium to high 
frequency regions, which requires extreme small size of elements to reach a  
necessary computational accuracy.  
 
The applications include: i) to analyse the vibration characteristics of various sim-
ple / complex / coupled systems from a point view of power flows including  
energy transmissions from one part to another and transmission paths, energy dis-
tributions and patterns, geometrical pictures of energy flow field and variations  
affected by system parameters; ii) active and passive vibration controls to reduce 
the excitation power transmission into structures and to minimise the power flow 
within structures; iii) noise reductions to reduce noise levels by controlling the 
dominant noise power and transmission and using noise absorption materials;  
iv) damage detections based on energy flow variables; v) power flow designs and 
control to satisfy practical requirements, etc. 
1.6.2 Linear Power Flow Analysis 
The universal energy conservation law has been well known in physics, for which 
it has been very difficult to trace its originality. For example, it was said that  in 
1850, William Rankine (1853)  first used the phrase the law of the conservation of 
energy for the principle, however,  in 1877 Peter Guthrie Tait (see, Hadden 1994) 
claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative 
reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathe-
matica. This is now regarded as an example of Whig history (Hadden 1994). Al-
though this law has been widely used to derive various type of energy equations in 
continuum mechanics, especially classical thermodynamics (see, for example, 
Love 1927; Green & Zerna 1954;  Fung 1965, 1977; Fung & Tong 2001), its first 
form with a defined energy flux density vector, Poynting vector, was contributed 
by Poynting to describe energy transmission in  electromagnetic fields (Poynting 
1884) . However, more recent interests and attentions of scientists and engineers 
into power flow investigations for vibration systems were lighten by Lyon’s 
(1975) important contribution, where statistical energy analysis involving random 
probabilistic theory (Newland 1975; Price & Bishop 1974) was proposed.  
Now, it has been widely recognised that the power-flow analysis (PFA) or the 
statistical energy analysis (SEA) provides a technique able to model the high-
frequency dynamic responses of structural or fluid dynamical systems of high 
modal density. The fundamental concepts of PFA are discussed by Goyder & 
White (1980abc), whereas an ASME special publication NCA-3: statistical energy 
analysis edited by Hsu, Nefske & Akay (1987) and Fahy’s (1994) comprehensive 
critical review of SEA highlighted its origins, developments and possible future 
directions. The interested reader may wish to consult these references together 
with Price & Keane (1994) for they include discussions of the contributions of 
Lyon (1975) and other investigators to the subject area of high-frequency, excited

dynamical systems. At an IUTAM symposium on SEA (Fahy & Price 1998) sig-
nificant advances in the subject were reported. Of particular interest in the context 
of this monograph were the contributions of Bocquillet et al. (1998), who re-
viewed the validity of a solution of high-frequency models including SEA (see al-
so Langley 1992), and Carcaterra (1998), who examined wavelength-scale effects 
on the energy propagated in selected structures. In a critical review paper (Mandal 
& Biswas 2005) on vibration power flows, the reported experimental approaches 
to measure the power flow intensity or sound intensity, particularly focusing on 
flexural waves, were discussed and compared.  This review paper provides many 
valuable references with important practical techniques, such as, the pioneering 
work of Noiseux (1970) in the measurement of power flow in uniform beams and 
plates.  
Many of the PFA or SEA investigations discussed in the above literatures refer 
to a particular dynamical system at the outset: for example, a study of the power 
flow or energy transfer between two vibrating rods or oscillators connected 
through a spring-damper coupling. The dynamical system can be made structural-
ly complex but the general approach is to conceive the system, derive the relevant 
equations of motion, and implement a PFA or SEA in one of its many variant 
forms. Following the original discussion on the flux of energy in vibratory motion 
described by Love (1927), Xing & Price (1999) investigated power flows from a 
more generic viewpoint; namely, the development of a mathematical model based 
on the fundamental equations and principles of continuum mechanics to describe 
the power flow in a continuum and to apply the relevant results to particular appli-
cations (Xing & Price 1997 / 1998), that is, the reverse of the more traditional ap-
proaches. In this more generalised paper, the energy-flow density vector with its 
geometrical lines, energy-flow potential and energy flow equation for continuum 
systems were defined, based on which, the energy-flow lines for many dynamic 
systems have been investigated as shown in the references mentioned in sub-
section 1.3. Also, through this proposed mathematical model, it has been possible 
to validate a selection of results and hypotheses used in PFA. For example, a fun-
damental assumption of PFA is that transmitted power is proportional to the ener-
gy difference between two interacting subsystems. This is an extension of the  
relation derived by Scharton & Lyon (1968) for the power flow between two sim-
ple oscillators (Lyon & Maidanik 1962). Furthermore, it has been proposed by 
Nefske & Sung (1987) that the flow of mechanical energy through a structural / 
acoustic system may be modelled in a manner similar to that of the flow of ther-
mal energy in a heat-conduction problem. If this hypothesis is true, it would result 
in relatively efficient numerical models being developed to determine the trans-
mission of structural-borne energy in large built-up structures. Wohlever &  
Bernhard (1992) investigated this hypothesis through rods and beams and con-
cluded that the energy flow in a rod behaves approximately according to the ther-
mal energy-flow analogy, but a beam solution demonstrates significantly different 
characteristics than those predicated by the thermal analogy governed by a heat 
conduction equation (Courant & Hilbert 1962). Investigations by Carcaterra &

Sestieri (1995) and Xing & Price (1997/1998) confirmed the general lack of simi-
larity between mechanical and thermal concepts. From the viewpoint of a conti-
nuum-mechanics-based PFA, such relations and hypothesis were investigated. 
There have been various approaches for power flow analysis proposed in the 
references, which is too many to be listed herein, but in a short summary, the  
following contributions should be highlighted. 
1.6.2.1   Travelling Wave Approaches 
A more successful approach in power flow analysis with its applications is a tra-
velling wave method developed to predicate wave energy distribution and propa-
gation in structures. This method is based on the classical wave theory and tech-
niques used to investigate elastic waves in structures. For example, Langley 
(1992) expressed the solution of each substructure in terms of exact wave mode, 
then forced equilibrium and continuity conditions at the junction were employed 
to calculate the junction scattering and generation matrices. Power flow results can 
be extracted from a wave scattering analysis using the wave mode amplitudes as 
the basic unknowns. This approach was applied to study the power flow in a net-
work of structural members (Miller & Von Flotow 1989), in beams and joints of 
beam-like structures (Horner & White 1991), in a number of panel arrays (Lang-
ley 1992) and in two- and three-dimensional frames (Beale & Accorsi 1995). 
More related recent publications on this method may be found in the references of 
a comprehensive paper by Renno & Mace (2011), such as: Mace (1984); von  
Flotow (1986); Langley & Heron (1990); Cai & Lin (1991); Mace (1992); Young 
& Lin (1992); Cremer, Heckel & Petersson (2005); Doyle (2007); Chouvion et al 
(2010). Especially, the important contributions by Miller and colleagues should be 
highlighted: the power flows in structural networks (Miller & von Flotow 1989), 
the optimal control of power flow at structural junctions (Miller, Hall & von Flo-
tow 1990) and the experimental results using active control of travelling wave 
power flow (Miller & Hall 1991). Furthermore, Heron (1997) presented a paper on 
predictive sea using line wave impedances. Walsh & White (2000) investigated 
the vibrational power transmission in curved beams, and Bosmans & Nightingale 
(2001) focused on the vibrational energy transmission at bolted junctions between 
a plate and a stiffening rib. More importance, Wester & Mace (2005abc) contri-
buted three papers for wave component analysis of energy flow in complex struc-
tures, which focuses on a deterministic model, ensemble statistics and two coupled 
plates, respectively.  
1.6.2.2   Impedance-Mobility Approaches  
Considering the term “impedance / mobility” in a more generalised meaning to 
cover, such as, “receptance”, “dynamic stiffness, i.e. displacement impedance”, 
etc., the impedance-mobility approaches are  based on the classical theory and 
techniques of mechanical impedance-mobility of dynamical systems (see, for ex-
ample, Harris 1998) to calculate the input / transmitted powers of the investigated 

28 
1   Introduction 
 
 
dynamical systems. These methods are convenient to a power flow analysis main-
ly focusing on individual structures, coupled beam- or plate-like structures or  
periodic systems. 
Langley (1989) proposed the dynamic stiffness (a force per unit displacement) 
method to investigate the transverse response of a row of coupled plates subject to 
distributed acoustic load. The panel was stiffened transversely and simply-
supported along the longitudinal edges so that the dynamic equation of each un-
coupled plate can be derived independently. The dynamic stiffness matrix of each 
individual component was obtained. The dynamic stiffness matrix of the whole 
structure was then assembled by using standard structural matrix analysis tech-
niques. By applying the force balance conditions and geometrical compatibility 
requirements at the coupling edges, the dynamic behaviour of the whole panel can 
be obtained. Expressions can thus be derived for the mean energy stored in the in-
dividual components and for the power flow between different components. This 
method was used to examine the power flows in beams and frameworks (Langley 
1990) and the in-plane vibrations of plate frames (Bercin and Langley 1996).  
Similar to the dynamic stiffness method, the receptance (a displacement per 
unit force) method was proposed to study the power flows. A major difference be-
tween this approach and the dynamic stiffness method lies in the chosen unknown 
variables to be solved. The former method chooses the coupling forces at the inter-
faces as the variables while the latter chooses the coupling interface displace-
ments. This approach was employed to investigate the amount of power flows at 
joints of beams and plates (Clarkson 1991) and at the interface of two coupled rec-
tangular plates (see, Dimitriadis & Pierce 1988; Farag & Pan 1996; Beshara & 
Keane 1998). 
The mobility (a velocity per unit force) power flow approach divides a global 
structure into a set of coupled sub-members with forces and moments introduced 
at their junctions. The vibrational power flow into a sub-member and between 
them is expressed in terms of input and transfer structural mobility functions to 
explore the power flow behaviour of dynamic structures. Petersson & Plunt (1982) 
proposed an effective point mobility method in the prediction of structure-borne 
sound transmission between a source and a receiver structure, which was used to 
model the vibration power flow transmission through periodic structures by Cu-
schieri (1990ab), multiple beams, coupled beam structures under in-plane loading 
by Farag & Pan (1996). The mobility functions of vacuous elastic cylindrical 
shells were numerically studied by Ming, Pan & Norton (1999) and applied to es-
timate both the input power and the power flow in coupled finite cylindrical shell 
systems. Mead, White & Zhang (1994) studied power transmission in a periodical-
ly supported infinite beam subject to a single excitation. Su, Moorhouse & Gibbs 
(1995) developed a power flow expression using the eigenvalues and the corres-
ponding eigenvectors of the real part of the mobility matrix for a practical charac-
terisation for structure borne sound sources. Gardonio, Elliot & Pinnington 
(1997ab) presented a model of vibration isolation systems by developing a matrix 
method using mobility or impedance representations of three separate elements: 

1.6

the source of vibration, the receiver and the mounting system and investigated var-
ious active control strategies to reduce the structural power transmission from a 
source to a receiver via a number of active mounts. Moorhouse (2002) presented a 
dimensionless mobility formulation for evaluation of the upper and lower bounds 
of power flows.  
Mobility matrices describing the dynamic characteristics of some typical ele-
ments, such as, rod, shaft, beam and plate, etc., are very useful in calculating 
structural power flows. However, they are not readily available when analysing 
complex coupled systems. To predict dynamic power flow characteristics trans-
mitted in coupled systems consisting of various structural members as mentioned 
above or more generally many different substructures, the impedance / mobility 
approaches were further developed. Clarkson (1991) applied the receptance me-
thod (Bishop & Johnson 1960) to investigate the transmission of vibrational ener-
gy across structural joints of connected beams and connected plates. The transfer 
matrix or four-pole parameter method is more suitable to an assembled system 
connected in series or in parallel (Molly 1957; Snowdon 1971). This method orig-
inally limited to unidirectional single-input / single-output linear mechanical sys-
tems was extended to multiple-input / multiple-output linear systems (Ha & Kim 
1995; Xiong 1996).  However, when assembling substructures in these systems 
with different inputs and outputs, generalised inverse or pseudo-inverse processes 
(Pringle & Rayner 1971) associated with rectangular four-pole parameter matrices 
are required to examine or to estimate coupling interactions. This causes increased 
complexity in the mathematical model and subsequent solution. 
1.6.2.3   Progressive Approaches 
To overcome the difficulty met in dealing with power flow analysis using the 
above classical impedance mobility methods, Xiong, Xing & Price (2001) ex-
tended their proposed impedance / mobility approaches ( Xiong, Xing & Price 
2000ab) and derived a generalised mobility and impedance matrices for three-
dimensional rigid and elastic structures, based on which equivalent mobility and 
equivalent impedance matrices are introduced to describe the dynamical power 
flow behaviour of a subsystem assembled from several inter-connected substruc-
tures within the overall system. As a result of this, the two progressive approaches 
were developed to predict force vector, velocity response vector and power flows 
transmitted between substructures in a complex coupled system consisting of n 
substructures subject to selected boundary conditions and multiple excitations. 
The proposed methods are very efficient and greatly reduce the complexity of the 
power flow analysis when examining complex dynamic coupling systems. For the 
special case of periodic systems, where the substructures are identical, these  
methods become even more effective.

1.6.2.4   FEA and Numerical Substructure-Subdomain Approaches 
Although applications of the above analytical PFA approaches described above 
can provide physical insight of the energy and power flow patterns within struc-
tures, they are limited to simple uniform structures. For complex structures,  
numerical methods have to be adopted to obtain approximate solutions. 
The finite element methods (FEA) (see for example, Bathe 1996; Zienkiewicz 
& Taylor 1989, 1990; Huebner et al. 1995) provide very powerful numerical ap-
proaches with commercial software to simulate various engineering problems us-
ing computers. A noticeable limitation of FEA is inherently to analyse vibrations 
at relatively low frequencies where the number of mode shapes is lower, due to at 
high frequencies requiring small meshes to describe the rapidly changing modes 
of the structures (Kim, Kang & Kim 1994abc). It is widely accepted that the ele-
ment size in element-based acoustic computations should be 1/6~1/10 of the wa-
velength to obtain a necessary numerical accuracy for engineering applications. 
Based on these criteria, FEA approaches were still used in vibration / acoustic 
analysis with the fast development of the speed and capacity of modern comput-
ers. Earlier, Lyon (1975) suggested the use of FEA in predicting coupling loss fac-
tors during the early development stage of statistical energy analysis. Hambric 
(1990) used the FEA to estimate the power flow in more complex structures, such 
as ribbed-panel and truss structures. In parallel, a modal analysis was used to es-
timate power flow in beams, plates and shells (Gavric & Pavic 1990, 1993;  
Hambric & Taylor 1994; Hambric, 1995). In the context of a gear-box top plate, 
Nejade & Singh (2002) carried out an analytical computation using the FEA to in-
vestigate the effects of uncorrelated noise, edge reflections, and damping on sound 
intensity.  
Nefske & Sung (1987, 1989) presented a second-order differential equation, simi-
lar to the heat conduction equation, based on which to conduct a power flow infinite 
element analysis of beams, which was further studied by Wohlever and Bernhard 
(1992), and to derive energy flow coefficients by Fredo (1997), although meeting 
difficulties in representing the location of dynamic sources and establishing energy 
conditions clearly at the discontinuity (Lase, Ichchou & Jezequel 1996).  
In all these studies, the response of a finite element model was expressed in 
terms of an energy flow model and a global FEA was performed on the global sys-
tem. To avoid the complexity associated with a global FEA, Shankar & Keane 
(1995ab, 1997) proposed a local FEA method using a receptance approach. The 
response of each subsystem was described by Green functions, obtained analyti-
cally or by using FEA, to study the energy flow in both simple and complex struc-
tures. Mace and Shorter (2000) established energy flow analysis models based on 
component-mode synthesis. However, from the analysis of two simple examples, 
Xing & Price (1999) concluded that, in general, there lacks a direct similarity be-
tween the flow of mechanical energy through a structural / acoustic dynamical 
system and the flow of thermal energy in a heat-conduction problem, confirming 
the findings of Carcaterra & Sestieri (1995) and development of any hypothesis or 
modelling based on such an analogy is of limited value.  

1.6

The energy flow density vector or sound intensity for noise analysis involves 
the distributions of the both velocity and stress fields of the dynamic system, so 
that the accuracy of energy flow calculations is affected by the both velocity and 
stress accuracies. FEA can provide a very good accuracy for displacement and ve-
locity but not for stress, since the stress calculation concerns the spatial derivatives 
of displacement field, and therefore not for power flow variables (Alves and Arru-
da, 2001). Especially, for acoustic problems with more high frequencies, the wa-
velength decreases largely and the displacement gradient changes sharply, which 
significantly affects the accuracies of calculated stress as well as the power flows, 
if the element size is not sufficiently small. The adoption of smaller element sizes 
less than 1/6 wavelength of highest frequency mode greatly increases computer 
simulation costs, since for the dynamic analysis of a problem, the computation 
time is proportional to its total degree of freedom (DOF) squared  or cubed. To re-
duce calculation costs, the substructure-subdomain methods (see, for example, 
Xing 1986ab; Xing & Price 1991; Xing, Price & Du 1996) for dynamic analysis of 
complex coupled systems with large DOF were proposed for power flow analysis. 
The fundamental idea of the substructure – subdomain techniques is: i) to divide 
the whole system into many small subsystems; ii) to solve each subsystem in order 
to obtain its dynamic information, respectively; iii) to synthesise the information 
of all subsystems to get the dynamic behaviour of the whole system, which has ef-
fectively reduced the computation cost for dynamic analysis. This technique was 
used for the power flow analysis of indeterminate rod / beam systems, L-shaped 
plates and a coupled plate-cylindrical shell system (Wang, Xing & Price 2002ab, 
2004). Using the developed computer code for substructure-subdomain method 
(Xing, 1991/1995ab), the power flows in the fluid-structure interaction systems 
were also investigated. For example, the generalised theory and formulation was 
presented by Xing, Price & Xiong (2003), an application to beam-water interac-
tions by Xing, Xiong & Price (2004), a linear wave energy harvesting device de-
sign by Xing et al (2009) as well as ship vibrations with controls by Xiong & Xing 
(2005), and Xing, Xiong & Tan (2009).  Furthermore, considering the interaction 
between the free surface wave on the water surface and the compressive waves 
caused by explosion in the water, Xing (2007, 2008) proposed a new suitable radi-
ation condition to model the dynamics and energy flows of this free surface-
compressible waves coupled system. It is also noted that Kwon et al. (2011)  
proposed a power flow boundary element analysis for multi-domain problems in 
vibrational built-up structures, which obtained the agreed results of the power  
flow density of simply supported coupled beams and coupled plates with the  
conventional approaches. 
1.6.2.5   Vector Field Approach 
The Poynting vector of electromagnetic fields defined by Poynting (1884) and the 
energy flow density vector defined by Xing & Price (1997, 1999) from a more ge-
neric viewpoint of continuum mechanics governing the dynamic behaviour of solids, 

32 
1   Introduction 
 
 
fluids and their interactions provide the variables to explore the energy flow trans-
missions and exchange within the continuum. Based on this definition, the energy 
flow lines and energy flow potential were defined and investigated through the theo-
retical analysis with some examples demonstrations (Xing & Price, 1999). This 
progress leads to a vector field approach to investigate the energy flow field using 
geometrical methods (Xing, Price & Wang 2002), which can show the energy flow 
picture in a dynamic system based on classical vector analysis (Weatherburn 1962). 
This method was used to provide the energy flow pictures of  L-shaped plates and a 
coupled plate-cylindrical shell system (Wang, Xing & Price 2002b, 2004), as well as 
the one of a beam-water dynamic system subject to explosion waves (Xing, Xiong 
& Price 2004). However, the analytical solutions of the energy flow vector can be 
obtained only for some simple problems, and therefore numerical approaches have 
to be used to get its solutions for more complex systems. 
1.6.2.6   Power Flow Mode Theory with Energy Flow Designs and Controls 
For linear dynamical systems subjected harmonic forces, it has been recognised 
that the averaged time change rate of kinetic / potential energies over a time period 
of excitation force vanish, as shown in Eq. 1.23. Therefore, the time averaged 
energy flow of a dynamic system can be considered as its natural characteristic 
depending on its inherent damping distribution, from which a power flow mode 
theory was developed (Xiong, Xing & Price, 2004, 2005ab). In this theory, the 
system’s characteristic damping matrix including material damping (Goodman 
1976) is constructed and it is shown that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this 
matrix identify natural power flow characteristics. These eigenvectors, or power 
flow mode vectors, are chosen as a set of base-vectors spanning the power flow 
space and completely describe the power flow in the system. The generalised 
coordinate of the velocity vector decomposed in this space defines the power flow 
response vector. A time averaged power flow expression and theorems relating to 
its estimation are presented.  
Furthermore, from this theory, a power flow design / control approach was pro-
posed to identify energy flow patterns satisfying vibration control requirements. 
The mode control factor defines the measure of the correlation between a power 
flow mode and a natural vibration mode of the system. Based on this theory and 
the method, considering practical requirements and possibilities, scientists and en-
gineers may design an energy dissipation pattern, modify energy dissipation of a 
system, adjust energy transmission path and control energy flow level / pattern to 
realise an effective vibration isolation and control . Power flow design theorems 
were presented providing guidelines to construct damping distributions maximis-
ing power dissipation or to suppress / retain a particular vibration mode and / or a 
motion. The developed damping-based power flow mode theory provides insight 
into the power flow dissipation mechanisms in dynamic system, compared with a 
mobility based power flow model by Ji, Mace & Pinnington (2003). The later was 
based on an eigen-decomposition of the real part of the mobility matrix to express

the force power input consisting of the power input of each power modes and to 
estimate the upper and lower bounds of power flow as well as its mean value, of 
which the applications require full information of a system's mobility. Examples 
were given to demonstrate the generality of the damping based theory, including 
non-symmetric damping matrices, and illustrate  applications through modifica-
tions of the system’s damping distribution using passive and/or active control 
components, (Xiong, Xing & Price 2005c; Xiong & Xing 2008). 
1.6.2.7   Power Flows in Structure-Control Systems  
Vibration control problems have received much attention over past decades  
(Meirovitch 1990; Fuller, Elliott & Nelson 1996; Housner et al 1997; Hu & Wang 
2002). The control of structural vibrations produced by earthquakes, winds, sea 
waves, explosions, impacts and other vibration sources enhances the safety of op-
eration of an overall dynamical system under examination. Successful applications 
of control strategies have been reported in many branches of engineering, like civ-
il, aerospace and marine ones as well as mechatronics (Housner et al 1997). In the 
past, vibration control systems were primarily studied adopting passive control 
methods such as flexible mounts, elastomeric bearing systems, damping or absorb-
ing mechanisms, (Thomson 1988; Harris 1988; Merian & Kraige 1998). By con-
ducting power flow analysis, the power flow transmissions from a machine into 
the base structure can be identified, which is a more appropriate indictor of isola-
tion performance than the traditional force or displacement transmissibility. For 
this reason, many researches focused their attentions on the analysis and control of 
vibrational power flows of dynamical systems (see, for example, Pinnington 1987; 
Pinnington & White 1981; Pan, Pan  & Hansen 1992; Gardonio, Elliott &  
Pinnington 1997ab; Mahajan & Redfield 1998; Li & Lavrich 1999; Xiong, Xing 
& Price 2000c, 2003).  
Although the passive vibration control is a proven technique to reduce vibration 
transmission between vibration sources and receiving structures, conflicting re-
quirements are often encountered in practices, which leads to limitations in control 
capabilities when the source and receiving structures are compliant and dynamical 
interactions between them exist (Jenkins et al 1993; Xiong 1996; Xiong & Song 
1996). Active control systems are capable of overcoming these limitations and al-
low the performance enhancement and increasing the efficiency of vibration  
control as demonstrated by references, see for examples, Gardonio, Elliott &  
Pinnington (1997ab); Sciulli & Inman (1998); Serrand & Elliott (2000); Kim,  
Elliott & Brenan (2001); Kaplow & Velman (1980); Scribner, Sievers & Von  
Flotow (1993); Clark & Robertshaw (1997); Gardonio &  Elliott (2000); Margolis 
(1998); Xing, Xiong & Price (2005). Their applications range widely and include, 
for example, the reduction of ground excitation to vehicle passengers; the elimina-
tion of transmitted vibrations in machines, aircrafts  (Wang et al  2008) and space 
structures; the prevention of machinery vibrations transmitting to surrounding en-
vironments; the vibration protection of sensitive equipments operating in harsh 

34 
1   Introduction 
 
 
environments, reductions of noise in aircrafts (Unruh 1987; Gardonio &  Elliott 
1999) and buildings (Luzzato & Ortola 1988); to name but a few. The improve-
ment of isolation effectiveness adopting active control strategies was undertaken 
by Jenkins et al. (1993), who illustrated the potential for combined active / passive 
isolation schemes. Leo and Inman (1999) developed a quadratic programming al-
gorithm to study the design trade-offs of a one-degree-of freedom single-axis ac-
tive-passive vibration isolation system. Pare and How (1999) proposed a hybrid 
feed-forward and feedback controller design approach to structural vibration con-
trol and developed a simple structural isolation example to demonstrate the benefit 
of an optimal hybrid controller to improve simultaneously isolation performance 
together with a reduction in closed loop control bandwidth. Xing, Xiong & Price 
(2005) presented a theoretical design of passive-active vibration isolation systems 
to obtain zero or infinite dynamic modulus. 
Following the success of power flow and energy transfer approaches for pas-
sive controls, these methods were also used to examine the control performance in 
an active manner, a vibration isolation system described by one- and two-degree-
of-freedom dynamic models (Pinnington 1987; Pinnington & White 1981; Maha-
jan & Redfield 1998; Margolis 1998;  Gardonio &  Elliott 2000) in which funda-
mental concepts of active damping systems were studied by examining the  
average power flow in the controlled and passive actuators subject to harmonic in-
puts. Pan and Hansen (1993, 1994) studied the dynamics of an active isolator by 
considering power transmission and thus extended the modelling of passive isola-
tion systems in terms of power flow to the modelling of active isolators. They also 
applied this power flow control strategy to isolate vibrations from a rigid body to a 
plate through multiple mounts demonstrating the possibility of reducing power 
transmission to the plate.  More complex cases relating to vehicle-bridge-control 
interaction systems, complex multi-dimensional flexible isolation systems and 
systems consisting of composite parts are also examined (Xiong, 1999; Xiong, 
Xing & Price 1999, 2000abc; Xiong et al 2001, 2002).  
After searching the publications for power flow analysis of passive / active con-
trol systems, it was found that investigation into the dynamics and energy trans-
mission mechanisms of a generalised integrated structure-control system in which 
active control subsystems are retrofitted into a complex existing passive control 
system are few and far between, although the progress has been made for simple 
systems as listed above. The modelling and design of an active control system 
consisting of flexible structures / components is of practical importance for tech-
nological developments in many engineering sectors. The fundamental barriers to 
progress and development of a comprehensive approach are found in the lack of 
good mathematical models to deal with general passive-active dynamical interac-
tion systems and the difficulties to perform effectively the dynamic analysis in  
extensive, multi-dimensional complex coupled systems.  
To address this problem, Xiong, Xing & Price (2003) developed a general  
linear mathematical model of power flow analysis and control for integrated struc-
ture-control systems. In this paper, the interactions between the mechanical system 

1.6 
Short Review on Current State of PFA 
35
 
 
and the control system, i.e. electric - mechanical interactions, were omitted, which 
implies that characteristics of the control system is not affected by mechanical mo-
tions and vice versa. To amend this, Xing, Xiong & Price (2009) further presented 
a generalised mathematical model and analysis for integrated multi-channel vibra-
tion structure-control interaction systems. These mathematical works allow to 
model generic complex structure-control systems consisting of any number of 
three-dimensional rigid / flexible substructures and control subsystems with mul-
tiple passive, active, hybrid control channels as well as their dynamic interactions, 
which provides a basis to develop a general computer program that may allow the 
user to build arbitrarily complex linear control models using simple commands 
and inputs. 
1.6.2.8   Damage Detections 
Early damage detections of structures under fatigue or extreme impact loads and 
measures have received extensive investigations. Approaches, such as acoustic or 
ultrasonic methods and magnetic or thermal field methods, are time consuming 
and costly (see, for example, Li , Zhang & Liu 2001). To reduce the cost, a model-
based approach has been developed, which examines the changes in global vibra-
tion characteristics of a structure. The fundamental concept is that any damages, 
geometric or physical / material ones, would lead to decrease in dynamic stiffness, 
which in turn reduces the natural frequency of the system. However, since the 
maximum stress point and the maximum displacement point in a dynamic struc-
ture are not necessary located at a same point. In some situations, if the damage 
causes very limited change of the global stiffness, the corresponding natural fre-
quency of the structure remains unchanged. For example, a geometrical damage at 
the free end of a cantilever beam due to its too large displacement will not affect 
the basic natural frequency of this beam. The damage detection using the power 
flow variable, a product of velocity and stress, can reflect both changes by mo-
tions and stress and therefore give more suitable results. Based on this, Li, Zhang 
& Liu (2001), Li, Liu & Zhang (2004) and Li et al. (2004) applied power flow 
analysis on a damaged Euler beam and a circular plate structure. It was shown that 
vibrational power flow is highly dependent on the degree and location of damage. 
Khun, Lee & Lim (2003) studied the power flow pattern of a plate with single or 
multiple cutouts. Lee, Lim & Khun (2006) extended their work and showed that 
this feature can be used to locate the crack.  Zhu et al. (2006, 2007) examined a 
cracked Timoshenko beam as well as a thin cylindrical shell with a circumferential 
surface crack and found that the power flow passing through the crack was highly 
sensitive to its location and depth. Wong, Wang & Cheng (2009) investigated 
power flow features associated with vibration modes of both intact and damaged 
beams and suggested that the modal power flow behaviour can be used for dam-
age detection.

1.6.3 Nonlinear Power Flow Analysis 
1.6.3.1   Interests for Nonlinearities  
The more and more increasing interests for scientists and engineers to study nonli-
near dynamical systems (NDS) may be the following main reasons. Firstly, prac-
tical engineering systems, solids, fluids or their coupling systems are inherently 
nonlinear ones with various nonlinearities, so that in some cases linear assump-
tions and analyses have hidden some important phenomena and provided no  
accurate results. Therefore a nonlinear analysis is necessary in order to obtain 
more accurate results to satisfy practical applications. Secondly, with the extreme 
fast developments of modern computers associated with computational methods 
and corresponding software, many complex nonlinear problems, which were 
failed to be solved before due to pour computation capacities, can now be tackled. 
Thirdly, a most important reason, it has been demonstrated that for many dynami-
cal systems, introductions of nonlinear members can significantly improve the 
performance of the system. Here we mention some examples. 
i) Nonlinear suspension systems can provide extremely low or extremely 
high dynamic supporting stiffness to obtain the required supporting frequencies. 
As we have known that high performance vibration suspension systems with a 
very low or a very high dynamic stiffness are widely required in engineering and 
industrial fields. For ground vibration tests of full scale aircrafts, the suspension 
frequency of the assumed rigid aircraft on the supporting system must be lower 
than one third of its first elastic natural frequency to meet the requirements for ac-
curate aircraft’s flutter analysis. The weight of a large aircraft is very huge but its 
first elastic natural frequency is quite low so that the stiffness of the supporting 
system must have a big static one to support the large weight and also a very low 
dynamic one to have a very low supporting frequency (Molyneux 1958; Xing 
1975). The low supporting frequency is also a fundamental standard for effective 
vibration isolations (Harris & Crede 1961/1988; Rivin 2003) of high precision  
optical instruments used in spacecrafts, such as for gravitational wave detection 
(Winterwood 2001).  
On the other side, in laboratories, dynamic tests of structures are often expected 
to be fixed on a rigid foundation. To realise this condition, the dynamic stiffness 
of supporting system must be extremely high, otherwise, the foundation could not 
be considered as rigid. As experienced practically, an extremely “rigid” founda-
tion for static tests could be very soft for high frequency dynamic tests.  
To design these supporting systems with particular performance, there are two 
approaches used. One is to adopt active feedback controls in a passive system to 
modify its dynamic stiffness (Fuller, Elliott & Nelson 1996; Xing, Xiong & Price 
2005). This method requires an energy supply for the control system, which some-
times cannot be realised if the required energy is huge. Another approach is to use 
nonlinear springs with a variable dynamic stiffness. For ground vibration tests of 
aircrafts, a nonlinear supporting system was proposed and used (Molyneux 1958; 
Xing 1975) to obtain a very low supporting frequency. The detailed investigations 

1.6

on designs, practical techniques and performance of nonlinear suspension systems 
were reported quite late, see, for example, Alabuzhev et al (1989), Platus (1992), 
Zhang et al (2004), Carrela, Brennan & Waters (2007),  Carrela et al (2008),  Kovaic, 
Brennan & Waters (2008),  Ahn (2008),  Cao et al (2008ab), Liu, Chen & Cao 
(2010). More recently, Araki et al. (2013) presented the effective designs of quasi-
zero-stiffness vibration isolators for their restoring forces to satisfy the conditions 
resisting large self-weight and to have the tangent stiffness close to zero around 
the static equilibrium position. In this paper, more published references on quasi-
zero-stiffness vibration isolators were introduced, which involves the designs  
using geometric nonlinearity, magnets and shape memory alloys. 
ii) 
Nonlinear vibration isolators / absorbers provide better performance. To 
improve the effectiveness of linear vibration isolators, different configurations of 
nonlinear designs have been proposed by introducing nonlinear stiffness or damp-
ing elements, of which the more details can be referred in a comprehensive review 
paper by Ibrahim (2008). In an very important book by Vakakis et al. (2008) pre-
sented the detailed information on the phenomenon of nonlinear energy pumping 
or targeted energy transfers, where energy of some form is directed from a source 
to a receiver in a one-way irreversible fashion. The vibrational energy from a li-
near system is transferred to a passive nonlinear energy sink where it localises and 
diminishes with time due to damping dissipation. Based on this mechanism, non-
linear vibration absorbers were designed to suppress the undesirable vibrations 
from seismic excitations (Nucera et al. 2007) and to improve the stabilities of 
aeroelastic or drill-string systems (Lee et al. 2007b; Viguifie et al. 2009). 
iii)    Nonlinear oscillators could be effective energy harvesting designs. Inves-
tigations on wave energy harvesting devices have attracted a wide interest around 
the world, for example, Thorpe (1999), Falnes (2002) and Rhinefrank (2005). 
Among these designs, the fundamental principle is to use waves to excite the me-
chanical motions of energy harvesting devices to convert mechanical energy to 
storable energies. Therefore, the motions of wave energy harvesting devices ex-
cited by waves are required as large as possible. Two approaches may be adopted 
to realise this aim. One is to design a linear device with its natural frequency clos-
ing to the wave frequency so that a resonance is reached. In considering fluid-
structure interactions (FSI) and using the developed numerical method ( Xing & 
Price 1991; Xing, Price & Du 1996)  with computer program FSIAP (Xing 
1995ab) , it was numerically investigated a wave energy harvesting device-water 
interaction system subject to the wave maker excitation in a towing tank (Xing et 
al 2009). Another idea is to design a nonlinear energy harvesting system and to 
use its inherent large stable orbit motion to extract energy. One example is to use 
the possible rotational motion, a periodical solution, of a nonlinear pendulum sub-
ject to base wave excitations aiming to wave energy harvest. Wiercigroch and his 
team (see, Xu el al 2005, 2007; Litaka et al 2008, 2010; Lencia et al 2008; Horton 
2011; Nandakumar et al 2012; Pavlovskaia 2012) theoretically and experimentally 
investigated this type of device and obtained very useful results. Another example 
is a flapping foil device located in air / water flows. As we have learnt that this 
system is a flutter system (Bisplinghoff, Ashley & Halfman 1955; Fung 1969) of 
which a periodical oscillation happens when the speed of flow reaches its critical 

38 
1   Introduction 
 
 
one. In aircraft designs, flutters are very harmful and have to be avoided. In this 
oscillation, the fluid flow supplies the energy to be dissipated by the damping of 
the system, which in principle provides a mechanism to design wave energy har-
vesting device. Considering the energy harvesting element plays a damping role in 
the integrated system demonstrated by Xing et al. (2009), we can design a flap-
ping foil system to reach its “flutter” state by adjusting its parameters as well as 
energy harvesting amplitude according to the flow speed, from which to collect 
energy. Yang, Xiong & Xing (2011) numerically investigated this system and re-
vealed that the efficiency of energy harvest was largely increased. 
1.6.3.2   Power Flow Analysis in NDS  
To evaluate the efficiencies of different designs of nonlinear systems described 
above, the force or the displacement variable, such as their transmissibility, is of-
ten used as the performance indicator. As we have mentioned that the power flow 
analysis approach is based on the universal law of energy conservation suitable to 
various systems in different fields, therefore it is no doubt to deal with nonlinear 
systems. In fact, the classical Hamilton Principle (see, for example, Abraham & 
Marsden 1978; Oden & Reddy 1976) and its more generalised forms (Xing 1990; 
Xing & Price 1991) in the theoretical mechanics were derived from the work-
energy principle. More directly, Li (1996, 1999) and Li & Ye (2003, 2006) pro-
posed an energy method to investigate periodical solutions of strongly nonlinear 
systems, which was further completed and given in their book (Li & Ye 2008). 
This method considers the sum of physical kinetic and potential energies as the 
mechanical energy E of nonlinear systems, from which a closed equal energy 
curve in the phase space

amplitude E and an angleθ , satisfying

nates. Here, a and b was determined by some complex geometrical conditions.  
Using this method, the possible periodical solutions and stabilities were discussed.  
Recently, it has been shown a growing interest in PFA of nonlinear dynamical 
systems. Royston & Singh (1996) employed vibratory power transmission as a 
performance index in optimisation of multiple degrees-of-freedom nonlinear 
mounting systems. The same authors also examined an automotive hydraulic en-
gine mount and investigated the vibratory power flow from an excited rigid body 
through a nonlinear path into a resonant receiver (Royston and Singh 1997). Xing 
& Price (2004) proposed a generalised mathematical model for the power flow 
analysis of a complex system consisting of linear substructures / subdomains con-
nected by nonlinear controllers, providing a generalised approach to deal with 
many vibration control problems which are often met in engineering. Xiong, Xing 
& Price (2003b, 2005d) studied an interactive system consisting of a machine, a 
nonlinear isolator with a p-th power damping and q-th power stiffness as well as a 
flexible ship excited by sea waves. The input power spectrum was found to be not 
globally sensitive to the nonlinearities in damping and stiffness of the isolator, but 
affected significantly around resonance frequencies of the coupled system. More

recently, Xiong & Cao (2011) investigated the nonlinear power flow characteris-
tics of a two degrees-of-freedom system with nonlinear stiffness created by a pair 
of oblique springs. Xing et al. (2011) presented a mathematical model with solu-
tion approaches for an integrated electric converter, a nonlinear oscillator and wa-
ter interaction system to harvest wave energies. Yang, Xiong & Xing (2011)  
evaluated the energy harvesting capability of a nonlinear flapping foil system us-
ing PFA. They also investigated the time-averaged power flows of nonlinear vi-
bration isolation systems to assess the isolation performance (Yang, Xiong & 
Xing 2012a, 2013) and the instantaneous power flow characteristics of the Duffing 
oscillator (Yang, Xiong & Xing 2012b, 2014). In the Jian’s PhD thesis (2013), 
more detailed investigations on nonlinear dynamic systems are given, which  
include the power flow characteristics of the Duffing and the Van der Pol oscilla-
tors as well as the two degrees of freedom systems for vibration isolations and  
absorptions.

Energy Flows Defined for Vector Fields of NDS  
1.7.1 Limitations of Linear Energy Flow Variables 
While reading available publications on the power flows of NDS described in sub-
section 1.6.3, we have noted that all of them follow the definitions of energy flow 
variables in linear systems, such as physical kinetic, potential and damping-
dissipated energies. For a linear dynamical system, each term of its governing 
equation involves only one of unknown variables: displacement, velocity or accel-
eration, so that there are no couplings between them, and therefore the physical 
energies are clearly identified and calculated. However, generally, the governing 
equations of NDS will normally include some terms affected by two unknown 
variables, so that the couplings between the unknown variables happen. In these 
cases, it is difficult to identify the pure kinetic energy, potential energy or damp-
ing dissipated energy. For example, in the Van der Pol equation (Van der Pol 
1920), one term is
x
x

)1
(
2 −
α
, where α denotes a constant. This term involves 
the coupling between the displacement x and the velocity x of the Van der Pol’s 
oscillator, so that we cannot separate the potential energy and the dissipated en-
ergy by the damping of the system. This suggests that we have to find more suit-
able energy flow variables to investigate generalised NDS. 
Furthermore, it is generally sufficient to regard any NDS as a set of first order-
differential equations defined in a phase space. As it will be discussed in Chapter 
2, the left hand side of this equation is a derivative of a vector valued function of 
independent variable (usually time) and its right hand side being a vector field 
function defined on some subset of the phase space. The solutions of this set of 
differential equations are generated by the vector field function and are called 
flows. Obviously, we have to create a suitable energy flow theory to deal with 
NDS based on this vector field form.

As mentioned in subsection 1.7.1, in a term of the governing equation of a non-
linear dynamical system, there exists the coupling of dynamic variables, so that we 
cannot distinguish and construct the physical kinetic ( K ), dissipated ( D ) and po-
tential (Π ) energies as well as force power ( P ) given in Eq.1.3 for the nonlinear 
system. Actually, these physical energies cannot provide any information with the 
geometrical properties of the solution orbit

These are three scalar variables defined for the phase space. The generalised 
potential energy relates the position of a point in the phase space, while the gene-
ralised kinetic energy involves the tangent vector of the solution curve, and the 
generalised force power gives the energy flow, i.e. the time change rate of the ge-
neralised potential energy. The generalised potential and kinetic energies are non-
negative real number. The generalised force power gives the work done by the 
force vector along the tangent vector of the solution orbit, which may be positive, 
zero or negative.  If we add an axis for generalised potential energy into the phase 
space in Fig. 1.3, we can obtain its potential energy flows shown in Fig. 1.4.  
Obviously, in general, these three variables are not corresponding physical ener-
gies for the equation in phase space, therefore, we use the word, “generalised”, to 
distinguish them. In chapter 3, three energy flow variables will be more detailed  
investigated, based on which the energy flow behaviour of nonlinear dynamical  
systems described in phase space will be examined and explored in this book. 
1.7.3 Characteristics of NDS 
Compared with linear dynamical systems, NDS have shown the following main 
different behaviours. 
i) 
For a linear system subject a harmonic excitation of frequencyΩ , its  
dynamic responses, displacement, velocity and acceleration are all harmonic

variables of frequencyΩ , which is called as the “frequency reservation” of linear 
systems. For nonlinear systems, this is not still valid. The frequencies of the dy-
namic responses of a nonlinear system could be lower or higher than the fre-
quency of the harmonic force. There are some components with possible fractional 
or multiple frequencies in the dynamic responses. Moreover, the amplitude of 
nonlinear dynamic response will not be proportional to the amplitude of the force 
as valid for linear systems. 
ii) 
For a linear system in a periodical motion, the averaged time change rate 
of kinetic and potential energies over the time period respectively vanish. This im-
plies that the kinetic energy and the potential energy are respectively conservative 
in the time period and the work done by the force in the period is totally dissipated 
by the damping of the system. This conclusion is not generally valid for periodical 
motions of nonlinear systems, in which the averaged time change rates of kinetic 
and potential energies are no longer respectively vanish in the time period of the 
periodical motion. Due to the couplings of dynamic variables in each term of the 
equation, the work done by each term in the period normally does not vanish, al-
though for periodical motions the total work done by all terms of the nonlinear 
equation vanishes. This implies that in the time period, some energy exchanges 
between each term happen.  
iii) 
The solution of a linear system is unique, but generally the solutions of a 
nonlinear system are not unique. At some points on the solution orbit, there may 
exist some branches, bifurcations, and therefore the stability about a solution is 
necessary to be studied.  
iv) 
Chaotic motions have found for many nonlinear systems, which are very 
sensitive to the changes of the system parameters. 
 
Those different characteristics of NDS must cause the corresponding changes 
of the energy flows of the system. To identify these changes from which to reveal 
some energy flow phenomena and mechanism of NDS is a main aim of this book 
using the defined energy flow variables for vector field equations in phase space.

Chapter 2 
Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations 
In this chapter, we review some basic topics in the theory of ordinary differential 
equations from the viewpoints of the global geometrical approach which is a base 
to develop the energy flow analysis for NDS. In the first two sections the review 
of basic theory for dynamical systems and differential equations is rapid. The third 
section discusses the fixed points of differential equations and defines the fixed 
point surfaces, from which the translation velocity and transmission velocity of a 
fixed point surface are formulated. The fourth section quickly mentions the  
stability of a solution of differential equations. We assume that the reader is  
fairly familiar with this material and with the fundamental notions form analysis 
used in its derivation, which could be further read in publications, such as Guck-
enheimer & Holmes (1983); Thompson & Stewart (1986); Chen & Tang (1992);  
Yang et al (2011).

time derivative of the vector x  and f~ is a smooth function of the variable t , the

mentions to neglect the word “non-dimensional”, we always consider all equations 
and involved variables as their non-dimensional ones.

This form of the solution in the polar coordinate system is convenient to investi-
gate periodic solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems. 
Systems governed by Eq. 2.3, in which the vector field does not explicitly con-
tain time, are called autonomous. Since the vector field of the autonomous system 
is invariant with respect to translation in time, the solutions based at times 
0
0 ≠
t
 
can always be translated to
0
0 =
t
.  
Equation 2.3 allows explicit time dependence and therefore the vectors and the 
trajectories would always be wiggling, which would ruin the geometric picture. To 
visualise a phase space with trajectories frozen in it, we introduce a variable

considered as a flow on a differentiable manifold M arising from a vector fieldf , 
regarded as a map

Chapter 3 
Energy Flow of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems 
This chapter gives the developed energy flow theory and approach for nonlinear dy-
namical systems defined by vector fields in phase space, which will be used in the 
following chapters of this monograph. The generalised potential energy and kinetic 
energy in phase space are defined, which are two scalar variables embedded into the 
phase space to investigate the energy flow behaviour of nonlinear dynamical sys-
tems. The first one involves positions of flow points in phase space and the second 
one links to the tangent vector, flow directions, in tangent bundle of vector fields. 
Surfaces of potential energy level are introduced to measure the potential energy at 
each point in phase space. The energy flow equation for nonlinear dynamical sys-
tems is derived, and the corresponding energy flow field with its characteristics, 
such as, energy flow lines, energy flow gradient vectors, energy flow characteristic 
factors, are discussed. The formulations for time and spatial derivatives of genera-
lised potential energy and the variations of energy flow are presented. Zero energy 
flow surfaces, on which the time change rate of generalised potential energy of the 
system vanishes, with their normal vectors are defined, and its local behaviour are 
investigated. The time change rate of phase volume strain is formulated. To under-
stand the defined energy flow gradient vector and energy flow characteristic factors, 
three examples are given in the last subsection of this chapter.

These two positive scalar functions depend on the position vectory  and the veloc-
ity vector y , tangent vector at a point on a trajectory in the phase space
n
R , re-
spectively. Therefore, they are used as the two variables to measure the position 
and its velocity of a point on the trajectory in the space
n
R , respectively. Geome-
trically, the generalised potential energy represents a half square of the distance  
of a point to the origin of the phase space. The generalised kinetic energy has a 
similar geometrical meaning in the tangent bundle space. 
For a linear dynamic system with x and x  respectively representing its physi-
cal displacement and velocity vectors, the terms 
2
/
x
xT
 and 
2
/
p
pT
 may 
represent its physical potential energy and kinetic energy of the system, respec-
tively. Therefore, E  could be the total mechanical energy of the system. The 
terms  
2
/
x
x 
 T
 and 
2
/
p
p 
 T
 may represent the physical kinetic energy and the 
acceleration energy of the system, respectively.  However, generally, for differen-
tial equations of nonlinear dynamic systems in phase space, x and x may not be 
defined as the physical displacement vector and velocity vector, respectively, so 
that E may not be the total mechanical energy of the system.  The word of “gene-
ralised” is used to avoid any confusion with physical potential and kinetic energies 
of the system. For a convenience in the descriptions of this book, we may neglect 
the word “generalised” if it is no confusions. 
3.2 
Surfaces of Potential Energy Level

space by equation

There are no intersections of two energy level surfaces. The normal vector of

The second equation in Eq. 3.5 is defined by the initial generalised potential ener-
gy 
0
E  of the system at time
0
=
t
. Therefore, Eq. 3.5 defines an energy flow bal-
ance equation of a dynamic system, which can be described as: for a nonlinear 
dynamic system with an initial potential energy
0
E , its time change rate of gene-
ralised potential energy equals the power of its generalised force.  
Physically, the energy flow balance equation represents the universal work-
energy principle for nonlinear dynamic systems. In fact, using Eq. 2.2, from the 
energy flow Eq. 3.5, it follows that

This gives an equation governing the time change rate of generalised kinetic  
energy of the system, which may called as the kinetic energy flow equation of the 
system. In the flowing discussion, we mainly concentrate on the energy flow

any points on the flow is a constant equaling its initial generalised potential ener-

tial energy level surface of the space on which each point has a same distance to 
the origin.

From Eqs. 3.13-3.17, we may draw the following conclusions. 
 
i) 
As shown in Fig. 3.3 for 
2
R phase space, if the generalised force vector 
f is orthogonal to the normal vector 
e
N of the generalised potential level surface, 
which implies that the generalised force vector is on the tangent plane of the gene-
ralised potential level surface, this force does not do work for the system, so that 
the time change rate of generalised potential energy vanishes and the generalised 
potential energy E keeps its original value unchanged.  
 
ii) As indicated by Eq. 3.17, if the transmission velocity 
iϑ of fixed point 
surface is orthogonal to the normal vector 
e
N of the generalised potential level 
surface, the second order time derivative of the generalised potential energy equals 
to two times of generalised kinetic energy of the system.  
 
iii) As shown in Fig. 3.1, a large value of the generalised potential energy 
E at a point implies that this point is far from the origin of the phase space. Also, 
its energy flow value E defines the flow direction of the system: the 
0
<
E
,
0

and 
0
>
E
imply that the flow directions towards the origin to re-
duce the potential energy, along the tangent direction of the potential energy level 
surface, and backwards the origin to increase the potential energy, respectively. 
 
iv) Equations 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 respectively define a conservative, diverg-
ing and contracting energy flow field for nonlinear dynamical systems. 
 
v) Assume that V denotes a single connected domain around the origin of 
the phase space of a nonlinear dynamical system. If in this volume the potential 
energy is not larger than a maximum value, i.e.
max
E
E ≤
, and the energy 
flow

everywhere in / on V, then all possible solution flows are located in V.

near dynamical system, we need to know the space derivatives of the generalised

the nonlinear dynamic system. 
3.3.5 First and Second Order Variations of Energy Flow

y , to reveal its behaviour we need to investigate its variations about a time t and 
position y  subject to a disturbance variation tδ . Since flow y is a function of 
time, its corresponding variation

The above second variation of energy flow is a quadratic form of which the matrix

is a real symmetrical matrix with real eigenvalues

Λ . The transformation 
based on its eigenvectors can transform it into a diagonal matrix Λ~ and the corres-
ponding variables denoted by the notations with “~”. The positive, negative or  
zero value of this quadratic form is determined by the characteristics of the real 
eigenvalues. If all eigenvalues of the matrix

quadratic form is definitely positive or definitely negative, respectively.

3.3.6 High Order Isochronal Variations of Energy Flow 
To reveal the more detailed characteristics of the flow field structure of a nonlinear 
dynamical system at a time t, in some cases, we may need to investigate more high-
order isochronal variations of the energy flow of the system about a flow y subject 
to a disturbance flow η at the same time t. For example, for a system of its first and

 As a result of this, if the energy 
flow matrix E is definitely positive, the generalised potential energy at the equili-
brium point is minimum and it is maximum if the matrix E is definitely negative. 
Here, it should be emphasis that the minimum generalised potential energy does 
not imply the equilibrium point is a stable point. 
3.3.8 Equi- / Zero-Energy Flow Surfaces and Its Local Behaviour 
In subsection 3.2, we define the surface of potential energy level of the phase 
space by Eq. 3.3, which is a geometric structure of the phase space to measure the 
generalised potential energy of any nonlinear dynamical systems. To investigate a 
nonlinear dynamical system, we may introduce the concept of equi- / zero-energy 
flow surfaces as follows. We have known that the power

of generalised 
force in Eq. 3.5 constructs a scalar field called as the energy flow field of a nonli-
near dynamical system. The equations

define two generalised surfaces or  subspace in the phase space. We call the first 
surface as an equi- energy flow surface on which the energy flow is a constant
eP  
at time t. The second surface is called as a zero energy flow surface on which the 
energy flow vanishes. Therefore, the first order time derivative

neralised potential energy of the nonlinear dynamical system is a necessary condi-

tion to exist an extremum point y  of generalised potential energy given in Eq. 
3.15 at time t. Its sufficient condition may be determined by Eq. 3.18 to consider 
the second time derivative of the generalised potential energy. 
There are the following three cases satisfying condition in Eq. 3.33:

Energy Flow Gradient Vector and Characteristic Factors 
As we have discussed that the energy flow E is a scalar quantity identifying the 
time change rate of the generalised potential energy E of a nonlinear dynamical 
system, which directly links with the amplitude 
E
2
=
y
of the position vector 
in the phase space, so that the energy flow provides some information relating to 
the time change rate of the amplitude of position vector at a point on the orbit.  
The energy flow is a function of time and position vector and it is a scalar field. 
To reveal the change of the energy flow fields caused by position variation, we de-
fine the energy flow gradient vector and the energy flow characteristic factors of a 
nonlinear dynamical system as follows.

3   Energy Flow of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
 
The energy flow gradient vector p given in Eq. 3.57 defines the direction of max-
imum energy flow at a point y in the phase space at time t. An element 
Ip of p  
gives the energy flow caused by a unit position variation
I
η . A positive, zero or neg-
ative value of 
Ip implies that the energy flow caused by a positive 
I
η is increased, 
unchanged or decreased, respectively. If the energy flow gradient vector at a point 
y  in the phase space does not vanish, we can calculate the first order change of the 
energy flow along an arbitrary variation vector η at this point using equation

                                        (3.60) 
The energy flow gradient vector plays a same role as the energy flow density vec-
tor proposed by Xing & Price (1999) for the power flow analysis in continuum 
mechanics. 
3.5.2 Energy Flow Characteristic Factors 
We are more interested in the energy flow variations about a point on the zero 
energy flow surface to investigate possible chaos and attractors. For an equili-
brium point
0
=
y
, which is on the zero energy flow surface and also a singular 
point of the surface, its energy flow gradient vector vanishes, so that the first order 
variation of energy flow in Eq. 3.56 vanishes. More generally, if the vector η is 
along the tangent direction of a point on the zero energy flow surface, implying it 
is perpendicular to the normal vector given by Eq. 3.38 of the zero energy flow 
surface, the first term in Eq. 3.56 also vanishes. For these cases, we have to reveal 
the energy flow characteristics considering the 2nd order term in Eq. 3.59, i.e.

Since the energy flow matrix

, the all energy 
flow characteristic factors vanish. Physically, this is a conservative system of 
which the energy flow vanishes everywhere in its phase space since its generalised 
potential energy E does not change.

from which we can observe that the energy flow on x axis vanishes since it is the 
zero energy flow line. It is also found that the energy flow along a line parallel to 
the x axis on the energy flow curve keeps a constant, since the energy flow charac-

Chapter 4 
Energy Flow Theorems  
Here, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of nonlinear dynamical systems 
from a viewpoint of energy flows defined in Chapter 3. These include the energy 
flow behaviour of fixed points, periodical solutions or closed orbits as well as their 
stabilities. Some stability theorems in the energy flow forms are presented and  
two examples, a planar system and the Van der Pol’s equation are investigated to 
illustrate the applications of the developed energy flow theorems. 
4.1 
Fixed Point Energy Flow 
Theorem 4.1 The necessary and sufficient condition of a fixed point of a nonli-
near dynamical system defined by Eq. 2.3 is its generalised kinetic energy
0
=
K
. 
Furthermore, the energy flow at a fixed point vanishes and its generalised  
potential energy
Constant
=
E
.  
The necessary and sufficient condition of this theorem can be obviously dem-
onstrated by using the definition of fixed point and the definition of the genera-
lised kinetic energy K  represented by Eq. 3.9. Actually, if the generalised kinetic 
energy
0
=
K
, from Eq. 3.9 it follows [

and therefore from Eq. 3.5 it follows that
0

, so that

Following this theorem, we can determine the fixed points of nonlinear dynam-
ical systems governed by Eq.2.3 by finding the zero points of two scalar functions, 
the generalised potential and kinetic energies, which may be more effective than 
to solve a vector equation

Periodic Solutions or Closed Orbits 
A periodic solution is an isolated closed trajectory such that neighbouring trajecto-
ries are not closed and they spiral either towards or away from the closed one. 
Since the trajectory is periodic and closed, there exists a time period

Therefore, Eq.4.2 is a necessary condition of a periodic solution. On the other 
side, if the integration of Eq.4.2 along a single connected closed curve is valid, 
Eq.4.1 is also valid, so that from Eq.3.1 noting the starting and ending points for 
the closed curve are a same one in the phase space, and it follows

Therefore, if Eq.4.2 is valid, we have one of the following three results: 
Case 1:

(

corresponding to a fixed point of the system at which the 
generalised kinetic energy K = 0. A fixed point might be considered as a particular 
closed orbit on which only one point in the phase space.

zero energy flow surface defined by Eq. 3.33.  In this case, the vector 
)
,
( y
f t
 is 
orthogonal to the normal of the potential energy level surface of the phase space at 
point y at timet , so that it does not do work to change the potential energy of the 
system. 
Case 3:  the instant time change rate E of the generalised potential energy does 
not vanish at the all points of the trajectory but its time integration in Eq. 4.2  
vanishes. This represents that during the time period T, the increment of the  
potential energy equals its decrement such that the total potential energy is not 
change. Therefore, the total work done by the generalised force over the time  
period is zero. 
Following the above demonstration and discussions, we conclude the following 
theorem. 
Theorem 4.2: The necessary and sufficient condition of a periodic solution of a 
nonlinear dynamical system defined by Eq.2.3 is there exists a time period T and 
its corresponding closed orbit such that the integration in Eq. 4.2 over the orbit 
vanishes.  
Furthermore, if there is a zero energy flow surface, closed generalised surface 
on which everywhere the energy flows

ex-
cept at the individual fixed points, a closed flow curve defined by Eq.2.3 on this 
surface must be a periodic solution orbit. 
 
Based on theorem 4.2, the closed trajectories of a nonlinear system can be de-
termined by investigating the time integration in Eq. 4.2. As discussed above, 
Case 2 can directly be used to determine the equation of the closed trajectory of 
the system. Generally, to check if Eq.4.2 is valid, it is convenient to use the ex-
pression in Eq. 2.7 of the solution in the polar coordinate system. Also, we may 
consider a periodic solution of the system using the Fourier’s expansion form

This theorem is consistent with Liapunov stability theorem described in Chap-
ter 2 (Guckenheimer & Holmes 1983). However, the main contribution developed 
herein is that the well-defined generalised potential energy function E takes the 
role of the Liapunov function, which is suitable to any nonlinear dynamical  
systems, governed by Eq.2.10 and therefore provides a method to construct a  
Liapunov function.

Van der Pol’s equation provides an example of an oscillator with nonlinear damp-
ing, energy being dissipated at large amplitudes but generated at low amplitudes. 
Therefore, its instant time change rate E of generalised potential energy does not 
vanish during all the time. However, such systems typically possess periodic  
orbits around which energy generation and dissipation balance in one cycle.

Chapter 5 
First Order Approximations and Matrix Spaces 
This chapter investigates first order approximations of the energy flow equation of 
nonlinear dynamical systems. The differential equation of nonlinear dynamical 
system is expanded into the Taylor series at zero equilibrium point, and is approx-
imated to the first order of disturbance. The corresponding energy flow equation is 
approximated to the form of second order of disturbance. Using a summation de-
composition of a matrix, the non-symmetrical Jacobian matrix is expressed into a 
summation of a real symmetric energy flow matrix and a real anti-symmetric spin 
matrix. The energy flow of the system involves only the energy flow matrix and 
the spin matrix concerns the possible periodical solution of the system. A physical 
explanation of this summation decomposition is given. The four matrix spaces: Ja-
cobian, energy flow, spin and kinetic energy spaces are defined, and nonlinear dy-
namical systems are investigated in these four spaces.  
5.1 
First Order Approximation 
Introducing a control vectorμ  into the generalised dynamical system governed by 
Eq. 2.10, for which an equilibrium point 
0
ˆ =

corresponding to a solution y of 
Eq. 2.3 exists, we obtain the corresponding equations

characteristics of the nonlinear dynamical system and are independent of any ex-
ternal disturbance. The characteristic disturbance

Since the base vectors of the space are the complex eigenvectors of the matrix U , 
the spin space is a linear space defined in a complex domain and therefore, in gen-
eral, Eqs. 5.23-25 are complex equations. It is not difficult to demonstrate that the

 are real number. Therefore, only Eq. 5.24 
involving energy flows are complex. As discussed in references on power flow 
analysis, see for example, Xing & Price (1999), the power of a force is a real 
physical quantity, so that it is necessary to understand the physical meanings of 
complex powers, which is discussed as follows. 
5.5.3 Complex Power  
In the dynamics, we often express a physical quantity by a complex number, 
which implies that the real physical quantity is the real part or the imaginary part 
of the complex number. For example, a real force 
1f is represented by a complex 
force f~  in the following definition

though its instantaneous value, representing an instantaneous energy exchange be-
tween the force and the system, may not be zero. Based on this result, we call the 
first power 
rp and the second power 
ip  as the real power and the imaginary 
power of the system, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5.3, the velocity v~ is decom-
posed into the two components

the normal component does not contribute any averaged energy in a cycle period.

complex power p~  in the form

Equation 5.6 or 5.8 presents the first order approximation equation in the phase 
space for nonlinear dynamical systems. In this phase space, the variable is the real 
vector η and the approximation equation is a linear equation based on the Jaco-
bian matrix J  defined at a fixed point. We have decomposed the non-symmetrical 
matrix J  into the summation of the symmetrical energy flow matrix E and the 
spin matrix U . The energy flow generated by a disturbance η depends only on 
the energy flow matrix E but does not involve the spin matrix U , that is

. The spin matrix U involves a rotation motion 
for 3-D space and generally concerns periodical orbits in the phase space. The ge-
neralised kinetic energy matrix K  consists of three parts of which the matrix

the matrix

 relates their couplings.  
Based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of these matrices, the corresponding 
spaces are defined, which provides different approaches to investigate a system 
from different views of point. Table 5.1 lists the related formulations for the four

We discuss the relationships between them as follows. From the matrix theory 
(See, for example, Norman 1986), we can demonstrate the following theorems. 
Theorem 5.2 The summation of real parts of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix 
of a nonlinear dynamical system equals the summation of the eigenvalues of its 
energy flow matrix; while the summation of its imaginary parts vanishes and 
equals the trace of the spin matrix. 
Proof: we know that the trace of a square matrix equals the summation of its ei-
genvalues. Therefore, from Eq. 5.7, we have

Periodic Orbits 
For a nonlinear dynamical system, if there is a periodic orbit, the time averaged 
change of generalised potential energy in a time period T  vanishes as mentioned 
in Theorem 4.2. We assume that y  with

2.3. Using Eq. 2.9, we obtain Eq. 2.10 for which the fixed point

ˆ =
z
 represents 
the periodic solution. Now we explore how the characteristics of the periodic solu-
tion of the original system affect its first order approximation Eqs. 5.6 and 5.8. For 
linear systems, Eqs. 5.6 and 5.8 exactly are same as Eq. 2.10 since the high order 
derivatives of vector function F in Eq. 5.5 vanish. Assume that the variation η is 

114 
5   First Order Approximations and Matrix Spaces
 
 
also periodic with the same time period as the one of the periodic solution zˆ , so 
that based on theorem 4.2, for linear systems, it must be valid that

However, for nonlinear systems, the total time averaged energy flow on the left 
side of Eq. 5.39 may not equal to its first order approximation in the middle inte-
gration of the same equation. We discuss the possible periodical variation η for 
different spaces as follows.

Therefore, if all eigenvalues
Iλ  of the energy flow matrix E  are positive or nega-
tive, the value of the integration in Eq. 5.44 is positive or negative for any non-
zero disturbance vectorζ , so that the value of the first order approximation of the 
time averaged energy flow of the nonlinear system is not zero. This first order 
quantity is larger than the one caused by the neglected terms in Eq. 5.5, and there-
fore the total time averaged energy flow of the system must not be zero, which 
implies that the periodic orbits are not possible. From this discussion, we may 
conclude that a necessary condition of possible periodic orbits requires the eigen-
values 
Iλ  of the energy flow matrix E  are not all positive or all negative. For 
example, if there is a zero eigenvalue
0
=
J
λ
, a variation vector ζ of only com-
ponent 
0

ζ
in Eq. 5.43 could be a periodic motion with Eq. 5.44 vanishing.

In this space, the complex energy flow is defined by Eq. 5.24. The complex varia-
tion in Eq. 5.40 can be transferred into the form with the variable in the spin

As explained for Eq. 5.13, the spin matrix involves a rotation motion. Therefore, if 
the spin matrix vanishes, the rotational kinetic energy vanishes that implies no ro-
tational motion. A possible periodic solution implies a close orbit in the space. 
The motion in the close orbit forms a rotation. Therefore the spin matrix does not 
vanish. To summary the discussion above, we have the following theorem for ne-
cessary conditions of possible periodic orbits. 
Theorem 5.5 A necessary condition for possible periodic orbits of nonlinear dy-
namical systems is a) the eigenvalues of its energy flow matrix E are not all posi-
tive (or negative), and the spin matrix
0
≠
U
.  
It should be noted that the energy flow matrix E is defined on the periodic orbit of 
the system. It is convenient to transform the orbit to a zero fixed point using Eq. 2.9.

The imaginary part of complex power vanishes. Therefore, the necessary condi-
tions in theorem 5.2 are satisfied. This shows that the possible periodical orbit 
may exist although the energy flow, such as Eq. 5.59 and the real part of the com-
plex power, such as Eq. 5.62 for Van der Pol’s equation, do not vanish.

To conclude the above analysis, we have the following theorem 
Theorem 5.3 A sufficient and necessary condition for a possible periodic orbit of 
a linear dynamical system is that the spin matrix
0
≠
U
 and there exists a period-
ical vector function in Eq. 5.76 and a zero energy flow integration Eq.5.78. 
The necessary condition is obvious, because for an existing periodical solution, 
it must be the spin matrix
0
≠
U
, otherwise there exist no periodical solution. The 
periodical solution is a closed orbit in the space so that its change of the potential 
in a period vanishes, i.e. Eq. 5.78 is valid. On considering the sufficient condition, 
if the spin matrix
0
≠
U
, there exist n~ , (
0
~ ≠
n
), pairs of conjugate pure imagi-
nary eigenvalues with corresponding conjugate eigenvectors constructed a set of 
base vectors of spin space. In this space, a periodical function can be expressed by 
Eq. 5.76. If this function satisfies Eq. 5.78, it is a closed orbit.

Chapter 6 
Energy Flow Characteristics of Local 
Bifurcations 
This chapter investigates the energy flow characteristics of local bifurcations for 
nonlinear dynamical systems. Similar to the centre manifold theorem developed 
from the Jacobian matrix, we propose a centre energy flow theorem based on the 
eigenvalues of the energy flow matrix, for which two examples are given to dem-
onstrate its applications. Four simplest energy flow bifurcations of equilibria: sad-
dle-node, transcritical, pitchfork and Hopf ones are discussed.  
6.1 
Central Energy Flow Theorem 
The system governed by Eqs. 5.1 and 5.2 involves a control vectorμ, so that the 
eigenvalues 
Iλ  of the energy flow matrix E and the eigenvalues 
I
λ

 of the kinet-
ic energy matrix K are dependent on the control vectorμ. As this control vector 
varies, changes may occur in the qualitative structure of the solutions for certain 
control parameter values. These changes are called bifurcations and the parameter 
values are called bifurcation values (Guckenheimer & Holmes 1983). A bifurca-
tion point is defined as a point in the parameter-control space corresponding to a 
structurally unstable vector field (Thompson & Stewart 1986). Local bifurcations 
of a nonlinear dynamical system with controls are the qualitative changes in the 
phase portrait that can be characterised near a single point in phase space. Equili-
brium point bifurcations and the bifurcations of limit cycles can be characterised 
near to a point, so these are considered as local bifurcations. The important local 
bifurcations are all identified by an appropriate local simplification of the dynam-
ics. This approximation involves the Jacobian matrix J  of the vector field and ac-
counts for the lowest-order of the vector field near a point in phase space, as well 
as for the lowest-order part of its dependence on the controls. Based on the charac-
teristics of complex eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrixJ at a fixed point, the  
Centre manifold theorem (See, for example, Guckenheimer & Holmes 1983; 
Thompson & Stewart 1986) divides the phase space into three subspaces to  
examine manifold structure of the system at the fixed point. 

126 
6   Energy Flow Characteristics of Local Bifurcations
 
 
The Sylvester’s law of inertia (Norman 1986) confirm that the number of posi-
tive, negative and zero eigenvalues 
Iλ of the energy flow matrix E  are invariant, 
based on which we can divide the phase space into three subspaces to examine its 
energy flow behaviour at a fixed point. Similar to the centre manifold theorem, we 
may have the following centre energy flow theorem of which the proof is neg-
lected since it is similar to centre manifold theorem that can be read in the above 
references.

 therefore we have a centre manifold

c
E at 0 so that 
around the origin the coordinate vectors 
sζ and 
uζ can be approximated as func-
tions of 
cζ  to reduce the degree of the system. 
Compared with the centre manifold theorem, the main progress is that the in-
vestigation of a real symmetrical energy flow matrix E  is used to replace the in-
vestigation of non-symmetrical Jacobian matrix J  in the theorem, which will be 
more convenient to eigenvalue calculations using numerical approaches. Also, the 
approximation for higher order term of the centre manifold based on the energy 
flow matrix can provide the information on the stability of the system, which is 
unable to be confirmed based on the one from Jacobian matrix.

Therefore, in 
2~η direction with a negative eigenvalue -1, the system is stable. 
However, in 
1~η direction with a zero eigenvalue, the behaviour of the system can 
only be determined by examining high order term in Eq. 6.8. Based on Centre

Fig. 6.1 The energy flow characteristics of Saddle-node bifurcations governed by Eq. 6.16 
The bifurcation diagrams for these four equations are depicted in Figs. 6.1-6.4. In 
each figure, an energy coordinate axis is used to determine the local qualitative 
behaviour of the energy flow bifurcation of equilibrium.  
6.3.1 Saddle-Node Bifurcation 
Fig. 6.1 shows the saddle-node bifurcations described by Eq. 6.16. In this figure, 
the arrows parallel to x axis represent the time change rate of x while the vertical 
arrows parallel to E axis give the energy flow direction. The zero energy flow

eigenvalue of the energy flow matrix at equilibria vanishes. Similar to Fig. 6.1, the 
arrows parallel to x axis represent the time change rate of x while the vertical ar-
rows parallel to E axis give the energy flow direction. The zero energy flow lines

Chapter 7 
Energy Flows of Global Bifurcations 
In Chapter 6 we dealt with the energy flow properties of equilibrium points and 
periodic orbits for local bifurcations. The developed centre energy flow theorem 
relying upon the coordinate transformations transforms the general system into its 
normal form in the energy flow space, from which dynamical information can be 
deduced from the Taylor series of an energy flow at a single point. In this chapter, 
we shall consider dynamical properties which cannot be deduced from local ener-
gy flow information. These situations involve global aspects of energy flows. 
Saddle connections, Hopf bifurcation and Lorenz system are investigated respec-
tively in sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. 
Let us consider the system governed by Eq. 5.1. We can find its equilibria for a 
given bifurcation parameter

equilibrium point

otherwise, we can transform this equilibrium point to a 
zero point using Eq. 2.9. In the following discussion, we assume this necessary

a typical spin matrix, so that it is a central point with closed orbits about it.

Fig. 7.3 Energy flow behaviour of Hopf system affected by bifurcation parameter μ  
 
Given a different bifurcation parameter 
,
μ  there is a corresponding closed or-
bit. Actually, these closed orbits define a set of potential energy level surfaces as 
indicated by Eq. 3.3 or Eq. 3.10. With increasing of the bifurcation parameter 
,
μ  
the distance 
μ
=
d
from the energy surface to the origin of phase space, the 
energy E level, increases. This set of closed orbits controlled by bifurcation  
parameter μ has a similar geometrical structure, so that we can reveal the global 
dynamic behaviour of the system by investigating only one closed orbit, such as

quadratic form of which the matrix

E depends only on the bifurcation parameters 
and it is independent of the space point. Therefore, this matrix can be used to

 Due to two neg-

and in 
the outside of surface the energy flow

. Therefore, the flows at points in the 
outside of this surface move towards the origin in order to reduce the potential 
and the flows in the inside of the surface move backwards the origin to increase 
the potential. As result of this, this surface would be an attracting surface.

7   Energy Flows of Global Bifurcations
 
 
therefore, the averaged energy flow over the volume V  in the phase space is  
negative and the generalised potential energy in the volume always decreases. 
This implies the set of solution orbits are in a finite volume about the origin. 
7.3.1 Fixed Points  
7.3.1.1   Origin (0, 0, 0) 
Obviously, the origin (0, 0, 0) is a fixed point of the system. According to Eqs. 
7.24 and 7.26, this point is global stable if

as shown in Fig. 7.5, the zero 
energy flow surface about the origin divides the domain about the origin into three 
subdomains, outside this surface any disturbance points having higher potential 
energy move towards the origin due to negative energy flow but any disturbance 
points inside this surface with higher potential energy move to more high potential 
points far from the origin because of positive energy flows.

given by Eq. 7.34. With the parameter

, these two fixed points tend to the 
origin of the space, so that the three fixed points are merged into the origin one. 
The flow directions about these two points are similar to the one about the origin, 
which is governed by Eqs. 7.31-7.32 as explained in Fig. 7.5.

Chapter 8 
Energy Flow Characteristics of Chaos 
This chapter reveals the energy flow characteristics of chaos in nonlinear 
dynamical systems. For examples, for possible chaotic motions, their flows are 
restricted in a finite volume and the time averaged energy flow tends to zero with 
the average time increasing. A strange attractor energy flow theorem is given and 
the energy flow characteristic factors are proposed to identify chaotic motions. 
These characteristics are examined for Lorenz system, Rössler system, Van der 
Pol’s equation, Duffing’s oscillator and SD attractor, respectively by analysing or 
numerical simulations based on Runge-Kutta method. 
An early proponent of chaos theory was Poincare (1890). In the 1880s, while 
studying the three-body problem, he found that there can be orbits which are non-
periodic, and yet not forever increasing or approaching a fixed point Diacu & 
Holmes (1996). However, this proponent did not cause more attentions of 
scientists and engineers until Lorenz (1963), an early pioneer of the theory, whose 
interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction. 
After Lorenz’s discovery, investigations on chaos have been developed very fast. 
There have been many books and papers highlighting its origin, developments and 
possible future directions, for example, Sparrow (1982); Guckenheimer & Holmes 
(1983); Thompson & Stewart (1986); Abraham, Arecchi & Lugiato (1988); 
Kellert (1993); Strogatz (1994); Alligood, Sauer & Yorke (1997); Serletis & 
Gogas (1999); Kyrtsou & Labys (2006); Ivancevic & Ivancevic (2008);  
Werndl (2009), to be listed but a few. The interested reader may wish to consult 
these references for more detailed discussions on chaos.  
"Chaos" is normally understood as "a state of disorder". However, in chaos 
theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although there is no universally 
accepted mathematical definition of chaos, a commonly used definition says that, 
for a dynamical system to be classified as chaotic, it must have the following 
properties Hasselblatt & Katok (2003). 
i) 
It must be sensitive to initial conditions. Small differences in initial 
conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield 
widely diverging outcomes for chaotic systems, rendering long-term prediction 
impossible in general. Each point in such a system is arbitrarily closely 
approximated by other points with significantly different future trajectories. Thus, 

160 
8   Energy Flow Characteristics of Chaos
 
 
an arbitrarily small perturbation of the current trajectory may lead to significantly 
different future behaviour.  
ii) 
It must be topologically mixing or topological transitivity, which means 
that the system will evolve over time so that any given region or open set of its 
phase space will eventually overlap with any other given region. Starting from a 
point and then simply plotting its subsequent orbit, we could likely produce a 
picture of the strange attractor because of the topological transitivity condition.  
iii)  Its ‘periodic’ orbits must be dense, so that every point in the space is 
approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.   
In base of these characteristics of chaos mentioned above, we discuss their cor-
responding energy flow behaviour as follows. We have known that the generalised 
potential energy

Therefore as shown in Fig. 3.1, the energy flow Eq. 3.5 describes the flow direc-
tions of the system. A positive, zero or negative energy flow indicates that the 
flow is outward, along a potential energy level or inward in the phase space, re-
spectively.  
Based on these geometrical representations of the energy flow and the genera-
lised potential energy, we may obtain the following energy flow behaviour of a 
chaotic nonlinear system, which correspond the three properties mentioned above.

on the 
attractor. The energy flow must vanish on this attractor. We call this attractor as a 
zero energy flow “surface” of a nonlinear system. The position of a point on this 
surface in the phase space may be determined by condition
0

, which will be 
variable with time. Since existing strange attractors for nonlinear systems with 
chaotic motions, the curve of energy flow time history E must un-predictably os-
cillate around a zero line.  
 
iii) Flows are restricted in a finite volume: the flows of the system can only 
be attracted in a finite volume V in the phase space. From Eq. 3.36, it follows that 
the space averaged time change rate of volume strain of the phase space must not 
be positive, i.e.

energy flow matrix of nonlinear system are all constants, they must not be all posi-
tive.

This is because the chaotic motion can be considered as a periodic motion with an 
infinite period. Actually, due to the orbit is included in a finite volume and the 
values of instant energy flows oscillate around the zero energy flow surfaces; the 
integration in Eq. 8.6.1 gives a finite value, so that the limitation tends zero

v) Dense periodic orbits : on the zero energy flow surface, any closed

flow vanishes, which implies existing dense periodic orbits of the system. 
However, due to the zero energy flow surface is unstable; these periodic orbits 
would be unstable. To identify the energy change along a closed orbit around the 
zero energy flow surface and to generate a Poincare map of the system to discover 
possible chaos motions, we calculate the energy change

As discussed for Eq. 8.4, the zero energy flow surface could form a strange 
attractor of the nonlinear dynamical system. To this end, it is needed to investigate 
the variation of the energy flow around the zero energy flow surface based on Eq. 
8.8.3 and to check if the condition of Eq. 8.4 is satisfied. For any disturbances 
satisfying

Based on the results given above and the discussion for Eq. 8.4, we may have the 
following theorem for possible strange attractors. 
Theorem 8.1 Strange attractor energy flow theorem. If the zero energy flow 
surface in Eq.8.8.2 of a nonlinear dynamical system is a strange attractor of the 
system, the energy flow characteristic factors of its energy flow matrix E
 
in Eq.3.59 on the surface must simultaneously have negative and positive values, 
except at some isolated individual points. 
Proof  Assume that all of energy flow factors of the energy flow matrix E
at 
every points on the zero energy flow surface are positive or zero, the energy flow 
variation 
E
Δ
given by Eq. 8.8.7 must be positive, which implies that it is in-
creased the energy flow caused by any disturbance ηalong the tangent direction at 
a point marked by position vectorr on the energy flow surface shown in Fig. 8.1, 
so that the disturbance point identified by the dashed vector 
r
η
r
>
+
will 
moves away from the origin of the phase space. As a result of this, these distur-
bance points will move away from the zero energy flow surface, but not be at-
tracted to it. Similarly, if all of energy flow factors of the energy flow matrix are 
negative or zero, the energy flow variation caused by any disturbance is negative, 
so that the disturbance points inside the energy flow surface in Fig. 8.1 will moves 
towards the origin of the phase space, which is also not attracted to it. 
     This theorem is a necessary condition for possible strange attractor involving 
chaotic motions. For a nonlinear system with a constant energy flow matrix in the 
full phase space, if its energy flow factors consist of  negative and positive real 
numbers at every point of the phase space, the unstable zero energy flow surface 
of this system should be a strange attractor. Here, we consider the Lorentz system 
discussed in Section 7.3 as follows.

Fig. 8.3 shows (a) the phase diagram, (b) the generalised potential energy and (c) 
the distance of phase point to the origin of the space. In this case, the solution of  
the system consists of a non-periodical free vibration, the first part of Eq. 8.22 and 
a forced vibration, the second part of the same equation. Due to damping, with the 
time forwards the non-periodical free vibration is being damped and the system 
reaches a stationary forced vibration with the corresponding phase diagram 
showing a periodical orbit. The time histories of generalised potential energy and 
the one of distance of phase point to the origin of space behave periodical 
oscillations. 
The time histories of instant energy flows in Fig. 8.4 also show periodical 
oscillations, in which the damping one, representing the dissipated power, is 
negative.  We use the time period 
2

… and show the calculated value at the end time of each period in 
Fig. 8.5. Since the solution of the system reaches a stationary periodical motion, 
its time averaged force power equals the time averaged damping-dissipated one 
within the error range. 
     For the initial conditions given in Eq. 8.24, the solution of the system is a sta-
ble forced vibration described by Eq. 8.23 with no free vibration components. The 
corresponding curves of the system are given in Figs. 8.6-8.8, which show the 
characteristics of periodical motion of the system as described by the theoretical 
solution in Eq. 8.23 with energy flow solution in Eq. 8.26.

, the energy flow caused 
by the disturbance from the zero energy curve is positive and the phase space vo-
lume is expanding, so that the disturbance point moves away from the zero energy 
flow curve, which implies the corresponding piece of the zero energy curve is  
unstable.

the motion starts from the static point

, as a result of this, the solution point moves 
towards the origin and is also attracted to the curve. The two points defined 
by

are the boundary points between the unstable and stable curves, and 
therefore at which jumps from the unstable one to the stable one happen. 
8.3.4 Generalised Potential Energy & Phase Point Distance

For chaotic cases, the phase point at any time t is not predicated, so that the gene-
ralised potential energy and the distance of phase point to the origin are also not 
predicated. The time history curves of both them do not show any periodical cha-
racteristics. However, due to the flows restricted in a finite volume in the phase 
space, the amplitudes of E(t) and d(t) on their time history curves are finite.

 Using Runge-Kutta method of order 5 and

potential and c) distance of phase point to the origin of phase space. There is no 
periodical orbit observed in a), and the generalised energy potential and distance 
of the phase point at time t behave chaotic motions. Fig.8.12 (1) provides the  
instant total, force and internal energy flows of the system in a), b) and c), respec-
tively, of which any periodical behaviour is not observed if comparing with

of 
external force as an averaged time, we calculate the time averaged energy flow of 
each time period from beginning time until 250 seconds. The obtained averaged 
energy flow value for each average time period is marked by a small vertical line 
at the end time of each time period in Fig. 8.13 (1). Here, the time averaged ener-
gy flow per time period T is not predicable, and is not like the linear periodical 
case with a zero value shown in Fig. 8.8.

As we have given in Eqs. 8.6.1 and 8.6.2, chaotic motions can be considered as 
a particular periodical motion with an infinite period. Therefore, it should have the 
characteristic of periodical motion: the time averaged power vanishing in its infi-
nite period, so that if we let the averaged time tends to infinite, the time averaged 
powers of both Van der pol systems discussed herein will tend zero as described 
by Eq. 8.6.1. For a large finite average time, the corresponding time averaged 
powers caused by the external force and the internal factor of system will reach 
two small real values, one positive and another negative, and summation approx-
imately tending zero . To check this conclusion, we calculate the time averaged

 powers of these two systems with different average time ranging from the first 
time step until 250 seconds.   The obtained results are shown by Fig. 8.14, in 
which the averaged powers show large values at the initial time range due to the 
average time is small. This has affected the clearance of the curves in the follow-
ing time. To observe the characteristic of the time averaged power when the aver-
age time increases, we have chopped the curves before 150 seconds, and after 
which the resultant curves are shown in Fig. 8.15. We can see from this figure, 
with the average time increasing, the time averaged internal powers (c) tend to 
smaller negative values implying dissipated powers of the two systems, but the 
averaged force powers (b) tend to smaller positive values as input powers from the 
external forces, and the time averaged total powers (a) display smaller positive 
value tending to zero with average time increasing.

Lorenz Equation  
The Lorenz Eq. 7.22 has been studied in sub-section 7.3 for its equilibrium points 
and bifurcation characteristics. We have learnt that there three unstable equilibria: 
the origin and the two nontrivial fixed points when

, as well as un-
stable periodic orbits. The energy flow of the system can be represented by the 
quadratic form given in Eq. 7.24 which can be transformed into the standard form 
in Eq. 7.31 in the energy flow space. The zero energy flow surface of this system 
is shown by Fig. 7.5. This surface is an attracting surface and the flows at points 
outside this surface move towards the origin in order to reduce the potential and 
the flows inside the surface move backwards the origin to increase the potential.

We have also known by Eq. 7.32 that the set of solution orbits are in a finite vo-
lume about the origin. Actually, based on Eqs. 3.54 and 7.23, we obtain a negative 
time change rate of phase volume strain of the Lorenz system with positive para-
meters α  andγ , that is

which is independent of the position of phase point. Therefore, the phase volume 
of Lorenz system is attractive at every point in the phase space.

. We use the Runge-Kutta method of order 5 
to solve the lanford’s system with an initial condition (0.1, 0.1, 0), of which the 
numerical results are shown in Figs. 8.17 and 8.16. From Fig. 8.17, we can ob-
serve that the generalised energy potential and the distance of phase point to the 
origin of phase space are both unpredictable but with finite values. The instant 
energy flow shown in Fig. 8.17 (a) also behaves unpredictable. Since there is no 
external force in this system, we choose three average times: 2, 3, and 5 seconds to 
calculate the time averaged powers at the end of every time period, which are 
shown by short vertical lines in Fig. 8.17 (b)-(d), respectively. We have not found 
that the time averaged power for a chosen average time vanishes.  To check if the

time averaged power tends to zero when the average time increases towards infi-
nite for chaotic motions. We provide a time history of time averaged power in Fig. 
8.18 (a) of which the average time ranging from 0 to 250 seconds. To more clearly 
show its tendency, Fig. 8.18 (b) gives an enlarged curve of the time averaged 
power, in which the part of curve before 100 seconds is chopped. We can observe 
that the time averaged power tends to zero with average time increasing, but it still 
shows unpredictable data within finite average time 250 seconds.

Duffing’s Equation 
Duffing (1918) introduced a nonlinear oscillator with a cubic stiffness term to de-
scribe the hardening spring effect observed in many mechanical problems. Since 
then this equation has become, together with van der Pol’s equation, one of the 
commonest examples in nonlinear oscillation text books and research publications.

8   Energy Flow Characteristics of Chaos
 
 
8.5.3 Energy Flows of Duffing’s Systems by Moon & Holmes 
(1979) 
Mood & Homes (1979, 1980) reported a detailed investigation of the Duffing’s 
systems with the linear stiffness
1
=
γ
 and the external force frequency
0.1
=
ω
. 
It revealed that the system with the same force amplitude 
30
.0
=
F
 showed the 
orbit co-existing a strange attractor and a large stable period 1 orbit for small 
damping factor
,
15
.0
=
α
but only stable period 3 orbit for larger damping  
factor
22
.0
. We use the Runge-Kutta method of order 5 to simulate these  
two Duffing’s systems by Moon & Homes (1979) to reveal their energy flow  
characteristics, of which the results are shown in Figs. 8.19-8.22.  
Figure 8.20 shows (a) the phase diagram, (b) the generalised energy potential 
and (c) the distance of phase point to the origin of space, from which we can ob-
serve that the motion in case (1) of damping factor 
15
.0
=
α
is chaotic consisting 
of a strange attractor and a large period orbit, while the motion in case (2) of 
damping factor 
22
.0
=
α
is stable period 3 orbit. For case (2), (b) the generalised 
energy potential and (c) the distance of phase point to the origin show the periodi-
cal curves, respectively, except during a short starting time range when the mo-
tions caused by initial condition (0,0) have not damped.  
Figure 8.21 show (a) the total energy flow, (b) the force one and (b) the internal 
one. The tree curves for case (1) are chaotic and periodic for case (2).  We take the 
time period 
ω
π /
2
=
T
of the external force as the average time to obtain the 
time averaged energy flows for each time period from 0s to 250s, which are 
shown by a series of small vertical lines at the end of each time period. The points 
in case (2) of Fig. 8.22 behave periodic but not like the case with only one fre-
quency component as discussed for linear problem shown in Fig. 8.8, since here 
there exist three frequency components.  
To reveal the change of time averaged energy flows with different average 
time. We calculate the time averaged energy flows using average time from 100s 
to 250s and the obtained curves are given in Fig. 8.23. From this figure, we ob-
serve that the force averaged energy flow is positive to input power into the sys-
tem, while the internal averaged energy flow is negative to dissipate energy by 
damping. The time averaged powers for both of case (1) chaotic motion and case 
(2) periodic motion tend to zero with average time increasing, but case (2) curves 
show clearly periodic characteristic.

8.6.2 Time Averaged Energy Flows 
Since the system is in a chaotic motion, its generalised energy potential and  
distance of each phase point to the origin are also non-predicated, as shown by 
Fig. 8.26 (a) and (b). To examine possible periodical motions, we choose three av-
erage times 2s, 3s and 5s to calculate the corresponding time averaged energy 
flows, and the results are shown by the corresponding short vertical  lines at each 
end of average times in Fig. 8.27 (1), which does not show any periodical charac-
teristic. Fig. 8.27 (2) (a) provides a full time averaged energy flows as a function 
of average time from 0 to 250s, which shows its value approaches zero with aver-
age time increasing. To observe its tendency more clearly, Fig. 8.27 (2) (b) gives a 
chopped curve to show the details after 50s. We can find that within 250s, the time 
averaged energy flow approaches zero with still non-predicated values. Chaotic 
motions can be considered as a periodical one with infinite time period, and its 
time averaged energy flow vanishes over its infinite time period.

investigated on its nonlinear dynamical characteristics and it is called as SD Oscilla-
tor or attractor (Cao et al, 2007, 2008a, 2008b). Physically, this system consists of a 
mass m, moving only in Y-direction, supported by two inclined linear springs of stiff-
ness k and a linear viscous damper c, as shown in Fig. 8.28.  Since the two linear 
springs are symmetrically arranged in the two inclined directions, their resultant stiff-
ness component in the direction perpendicular to Y-direction vanishes but the one in 
Y-direction behaves a geometrical nonlinearity depending on their dynamic position. 
If the initial length of the springs is L, using Newton’s law, we can obtain the dy-
namic equation in the form

chaotic motions (Cao et al, 2007, 2008).  
Fig.8.30 shows the phase diagrams of vertical and horizontal SDs. Both of them 
are located in their finite volumes in phase space, since the time change rate of 
phase space volume strain is negative as given by Eq. 8.67, so that the system is 
attractive. The phase orbits are chaotic, but the one for vertical SD (Fig. 8.30 (a)) 
shows larger amplitude caused by the gravitational force. The generalised energy 
potentials and the distances of phase points to the origin of phase space for the 
vertical and horizontal SDs are respectively shown in Fig. 8.31 (a) and (b). These 
two variables are positive and also behave chaotic. Fig. 8.32 gives the time histo-
ries of instant total energy flow

of the investigated SDs. The total instant energy flows (a) and (b) show os-
cillations about zero value which is on the zero energy flow surface. However, the 
one for vertical SD is with larger amplitude than the one for horizontal SD, because 
of the gravity.

For further revealing the chaotic behaviour of the system, we take the time pe-

are shown by small pieces of vertical lines in Fig. 8.33. We 
have known that for periodical motions, the total time averaged energy flow in a 
period vanishes, but the force one and internal one take a constant, one positive 
and another negative but with same absolute value. Fig.8.33 does not show peri-
odic motions of the system. Fig.8.34 gives the time averaged energy flows as the 
functions of average timet . These time functions are obtained by using Eq. 8.68.1 
in association with setting T = t . We can observe from Fig. 8.34, with average 
time t increasing, the total time averaged flows tend to zero, and the force time 
averaged ones tend two positive constants for vertical and horizontal SDs, respec-
tively, while the internal ones tend two negative constants. This is because a  
chaotic motion may be considered as a periodical motion with infinite time period.

Hamiltonian System 
Hamiltonian system is a very important dynamical system in engineering, of 
which the detailed theory can be found in many publications, such as Abraham 
and Marsden (1978 / 1980); Guckenheimer and Holmes (1983); Thompson and 
Stewart (1986); Zhu (1996, 2003). This chapter discusses the Hamiltonian system 
from the point view of energy flows. After giving the general fundamental  
equation governing Hamiltonian systems, its energy flow equations as well as  
corresponding energy flow matrix are formulated. The relationship between the 
Hamilton’s function of integrable systems and the generalised potential energy of 
the system is investigated. The examples are given to demonstrate the developed 
theories.

trajectory in a 2m dimensional phase space

Integrable Hamiltonian Systems 
A Hamiltonian system governed by Eq. 9.5 is integrable if its first integration in 
Eq. 9.9 exists. For majority of practical problems, the first integration may not be 
explicitly obtained, but nevertheless we would certainly regard this system as in-
tegrable. In general the system governed by Eq. 9.5 will be solvable if it admits 
‘sufficiently many’ first integrals and the reduction of order can be applied by 
eliminating one equation from a first integral.  
For an integrable Hamiltonian system with its Hamiltonian independent of time 
t, the phase portraits may easily be drawn in the phase space. Figure 9.1 shows the 
geometric explanation of Eq. 9.9 for the 2-D case. In this figure,

The point A of position vector

 moves in the tangent direction τ  on 
the solution curve governed by Eq. 9.5 , so that the energy flow defined by Eq.

.                                                    (9.21) 
Since the amplitude of the position vector of the moving point A is
2E

, 
we can conclude that 
i) 
A positive energy flow 
0

at this point implies that the point A moves 
far away from the origin of phase space; 
ii) A negative energy flow 
0

 at this point implies that the point A 
moves towards the origin of phase space; 
iii)  A zero energy flow

Eq. 9.5 is valid, the functional in Eq. 9.26 is stationary, i.e.

δΠ =
On the other 
side,

δΠ =
 yields the Hamiltonian Eq. 9.5 due to the variations δq andδp are 
independence. This principle will be used to construct a canonical transformation 
in the next subsection.  
9.3.2 Canonical Transformation and Its Generation 
Consider an integrable system consisting of a 2m-dimensional phase-space  
2m
R
 together with m independent functions
Jf , (J = 1, 2, 3, … , m),  in a sense 
that the gradients 
Jf

are linearly independent vectors on a tangent space to any 
point in

We will show that these integrable systems lead to completely solvable Hamil-
ton’s equation of motion. Firstly, we discuss our freedom to choose the coordi-
nates in the phase space based on any canonical transformations.

Therefore, canonical transformations preserve the Hamilton’s equation.  
9.3.2.2   Generating Functions of Canonical Transformation 
The functional in Eq.9.26 and the Hamiltonian principle provide a direct approach 
to find a generating function to construct a canonical transformation. Since the 
two sets of coordinates for the phase space ( , )
q p and ( , )
q p
  describe a same  
motion governed by the Hamilton’s Eq. 9.5 or Eq. 9.30, the integrand in the func-
tional in Eq.9.26 for both coordinate sets must satisfy the condition

Therefore, Eq. 9.21 gives a zero energy flow shown in Eq. 9.54.  
Also, since the energy flow vanishes shown in Eq. 9.54, the theorem 9.2 can 
confirm this system expressed by the form of Eq.9.44. For example, in 2-D case of

consists of two masses, a linear spring k and a nonlinear spring k(1+y). We take the 
static equilibrium position of the system as our reference position at which the posi-
tions of two masses are chosen as the origins of the coordinates x and y, respectively. 
The dynamic equation of the system is derived in the following matrix form

Chapter 10 
Numerical Solutions of Energy Flows  
This chapter provides a generalised Matlab code to solve the energy flows of ordi-
nary differential equations for nonlinear dynamical systems. Following the de-
scription of generalised equations to be solved in sub-section 10.1, sub-section 
10.2 gives the detailed formulations of Runge-Kutta methods used in the code. 
Sub-section 10.3 is a file for users to use the provided Matlab code to solve their 
equations of nonlinear dynamical systems, of which the options include Van der 
Pol’s system, Duffing’s equation, SD oscillator, Lorenz’s system, Rössler’s equa-
tion, Linear system of order 2n and Generalised nonlinear systems of order n. The 
related input and output files are given for users to run the program and to get the 
calculated results. Appendix I designs the four functions for users to define the re-
lated functions of their nonlinear systems to be solved by JOB 7 code using the 
program PFANS.m (Power Flow Analysis of Nonlinear Systems) given in Appen-
dix II.  Users need to modify these 4 functions according to their problems.  
Appendix III listed the input files of some examples for users to learn using the 
program more quickly.  
10.1 
Equations  
For general cases, it is impossible to solve the energy flow equation for a nonli-
near dynamical system using a theoretical approach. Therefore, we have to rely on 
a numerical algorithm to get its solutions. As we have learnt that a nonlinear dy-
namical system and its energy flow are governed by a set of ordinary differential 
equations. Among available numerical algorithms for ordinary differential equa-
tions, an important family of time-integration techniques which are of a high order 
of accuracy, explicit but nonlinear, and limited to two time levels is provided by 
Runge-Kutta methods. A detailed description of the Runge-Kutta method can be 
found in Gear (1971), Lambert (1974) and Van der Houwen (1977). A discussion 
and comparison with other numerical schemes for them to be used in computa-
tional fluid dynamics are given by Hirsch (1988). These methods have recently 
been applied to the solution of Rössler system in base of a Matlab code provided 
by Christodoulou (2009). In this chapter, we further develop these methods  
to solve the energy flow equations of nonlinear dynamical systems. For our  

232 
10    Numerical Solutions of Energy Flows
 
 
convenience to discuss them in this chapter, we rewrite the all equations of nonli-
near systems to be numerically solved in sub-section 10.1, although they have 
been given and discussed in the previous chapters.

Physically, the translation velocity

represents the velocity of the energy flow 
surface moving in the space related to a fixed Euler coordinate system, which va-
nishes for any autonomous systems. However, the transmission velocity gives a 
velocity of the zero energy flow surface relative to the flow, which implies that if 
an observer standing on a flow particle and moving with it, this observer will see 
the zero energy flow surface moving with the transmission velocity

For periodical motions, the time averaged total energy flow vanishes, so that the 
force one and the internal one will be two real constants, one positive and another 
negative with same absolute value. For chaotic motions, which can be considered 
as a periodic motion with an infinite period, so that when
∞

, the time aver-
aged total energy flow tends zero, and the time averaged force energy flow and in-
ternal one could approach two real numbers with its summation approximately 
vanishing, that is

Runge-Kutta Methods 
The Runge-Kutta methods are described to solve the governing Eqs. 10.1 and 
10.2, the energy flow Eq. 10.11 and the phase volume strain in Eq. 10.16 of the 
nonlinear dynamical system. To explain the methods, we consider the following 
generalised equation

Computational Formulations 
The basic idea of the Runge-Kutta methods is to evaluate the right-hand side of 
the differential systems governed by Eq.10.19 at several values of u in a time in-
terval between

Therefore, the value of

Eq.10.21. There are also accompanying requirements if we require the method to 
have a certain order p, meaning that the local truncation error is O(hp+1),

Based on the Taylor expansion and the truncation error requirement, the 
coefficients

                       (c)   Instant internal energy flow. 
 
    Figure 4:  For the problems with external forces, the averaged time TT is cho-
sen as the minimum common number of the time periods of external forces, and 
this figure gives the following three averaged values at the end of each time period 
TT: 
                                   (a)    Time averaged total energy flow per TT.  
                                   (b)    Time averaged external force energy flow per TT. 
                                   (c)    Time averaged internal energy flow per TT. 
              
 
          For the problems with no external forces, three times TT1, TT2 and TT3 are 
chosen as the three averaged times, and this figure gives the following three aver-
aged values at the end of each time period: 
                                   (a)    Time averaged total energy flow per TT1.  
                                   (b)    Time averaged total energy flow per TT2. 
                                   (c)    Time averaged total energy flow per TT3. 
 
    Figure 5:  This figure gives the time averaged energy flows as the functions of 
average time t, which is increased from dt until the stop time. 
                                   (a)   Time averaged total energy flow per t.  
                                   (b)   Time averaged external force energy flow per t.

Defined Functions for Main Program  
As given in Appendix I, there are four functions designed for users to define the 
functions of their nonlinear systems to be solved as JOB 7 using the program 
PFANS.m (Power Flow Analysis of Nonlinear Systems)  given in Appendix II.  
Users need to modify these 4 functions according to their problems. The detailed 
functions and the related definitions are as follows. There are 4 parameters: alpha, 
beta, gamma, delta available for users to use them to represent some parameters in 
their equations. If some of them will not be used, these parameters can be set to 
zero appearing in the body of functions, as shown in the example for Van der 
Pol’s system. 
 
 

 
Appendices 
Three Appendices are given as follows to provide the details of the Matlab Pro-
