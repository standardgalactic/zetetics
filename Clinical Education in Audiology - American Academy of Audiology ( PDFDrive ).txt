Turning Insights  
Into Action
When selecting 
hearing instruments, 
there is no such thing 
as one size fits all.
Through enduser insights, Oticon has learned that it isn’t just about the 
peripheral hearing system we are supporting: it’s the whole person. A holistic 
approach to audiology recognizes that patients’ auditory abilities and cognitive 
skills differ and the key to true client satisfaction lies in treating the person as 
an individual.
The Oticon product portfolio empowers people to communicate freely, 
interact naturally and participate actively.

Clinical Education in Audiology: The Emperor’s New Clothes  Many of us feel a bit 
like the emperor and his subjects when it comes to clinical education in audiology. 
We have a nagging feeling that the whole enterprise does not quite make sense.

A Quick Look at Ocular Vestibular-Evoked Myogenic Potentials  In the mid–1990s, 
several investigators observed that particular neurons in the vestibular system 
of cats, called “irregular neurons,” were activated by low-frequency acoustic 
stimulation. This led some to investigate the possibility of using acoustic 
stimulation to measure the function of the vestibular system.

Limitless Wires in a Wireless World  It is so easy to get swept up in the swift current 
of technology, lose your bearings, and wind up floating aimlessly in an uncharted 
ocean. It is time to analyze what it takes to fit the ever advancing and supremely 
complex hearing instruments and accessories.

Evaluating Speech Perception Performance  While studies often report speech 
perception performance, there is no general agreement regarding choice of test 
material, sound intensity levels at which to test, or how to interpret test results.

President’s Message
What Sets Us Apart?
Even if you don’t follow popular music
closely, you’ve probably heard of Lady 
Gaga. Besides a catchy stage name, 
she has set herself apart from many 
of the other contemporary perform-
ers and has “branded” herself and her 
music quite well. Lady Gaga has set 
herself apart from the rest.
What sets audiology apart? How 
are we branding ourselves and our 
profession? What are we doing to 
ensure that audiologists are known 
as the preferred health-care provider 
for hearing and balance wellness? 
The profession has come a long way 
since its “birth” during World Wars 
I and II. In an excellent monograph 
published in Audiology Today in 
January 2002, Moe Bergman, EdD, 
provided a detailed and illustrative 
historical record of the “origins of 
audiology.” This is a must-read for 
everyone in the field. Decades later, 
from these auspicious beginnings, 
the profession of audiology is still 
“fashioning itself as a service profes-
sion” (to paraphrase Dr. Bergman!). 
That’s who we are, what we do—
we provide a service. Whether that 
service is as a clinician, a researcher, 
an academic, a hearing conserva-
tionist, a hearing scientist, etc., we 
provide a valuable and necessary 
service to our customers. To con-
tinue to build on our reputation as a 
“service profession” we must continue 
to brand ourselves and the service 
we provide. How do we do that? Let 
me point out a few ways we achieve 
audiology branding. 
First: Education. We do this 
really well from student to seasoned 
professional. We have rigorous, com-
petitive academic training programs 
in place throughout the country to 
generate educated, prepared young 
clinicians and scientists. After the 
formal coursework, we have a dedi-
cated lifelong continuing education 
mandate. We read journals, attend 
conferences, engage in on-demand 
learning with a plethora of Academy 
eAudiology options, and we attend 
the premier continuing education 
event of all—AudiologyNOW! We set 
ourselves apart through education. 
Second: Publications. Our own 
peer-reviewed audiology publication, 
the Journal of the American Academy 
of Audiology is a highly respected 
journal that has broad appeal to 
clinicians and researchers alike 
and our Audiology Today magazine 
is contemporary, informative, and 
award-winning! We set ourselves 
apart through publications. 
Third: Advocacy. We have a 
vibrant and growing PAC (Political 
Action Committee) that is dedicated 
to helping our elected (federal) offi-
cials understand the importance of 
unfettered accessibility to audiologi-
cal services for their constituents. 
We have a State Leaders Network 
and many state audiology organiza-
tions that work on the local level to 
educate elected officials about the 
importance of the provision of audio-
logical care. 
We have increased our voice and 
presence within the federal legisla-
tive and regulatory entities that help 
define how we provide our service to 
our patients. We set ourselves apart 
through advocacy. 
Finally: You and Me. We have 
each other. Each time we diagnose 
a treatable hearing loss in a three-
month-old, each time we hold the 
hand of an Alzheimer’s patient and 
help guide the hearing aid into his 
or her ear, each time we perform the 
balance assessment that aids in the 
diagnosis of a debilitating vestibular 
disorder, and each time we acti-
vate the newly implanted cochlear 
implant and see the tears stream 
down the patient’s face, we set our-
selves apart. No one can do what we 
do as audiologists. No one.

Executive Update
NEW: Coding and 
Reimbursement Series
CPT + ICDs + HCPCS + CMS =
a dynamic and sometimes confus-
ing aspect of billing for audiology 
services. Thus, the Academy is 
launching a series of coding and 
reimbursement Web seminars (live 
and on-demand) through eAudiol-
ogy…your CEU source. Debra Abel, 
AuD, Academy staff, and a well-
known expert on the topic will host 
this series from 1:00 to 2:00 pm ET on 
the second Tuesday of odd-numbered 
months, beginning in September.
By purchasing the $89 eAudiology 
package with membership renewal, 
Academy members can participate in 
these five sessions—plus an unlim-
ited number of on-demand sessions. 
We’ll let you calculate the savings, as 
these initial five, one-hour sessions 
alone would cost $150, if purchased 
individually.
The following sessions have been 
designed with you in mind. 
September 13—
Unbundling and 
Itemizing Hearing Aid 
Services
Unbundling or itemizing hearing aid 
devices/supplies and procedures will 
likely increase hearing aid reim-
bursement. Stephanie Sjoblad, AuD, 
and Debra Abel, AuD, will illustrate 
how you can implement this pro-
cess in your own facility today…for 
greater reimbursement tomorrow!
November 8—Medicare 
Enrollment and 
Regulations
In response to the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) tightening the requirement for 
revalidation of all Medicare provid-
ers by March 23, 2013, the enrollment 
process will be reviewed by Debra 
Abel, AuD. Updates in Medicare poli-
cies will also be discussed.
January 10—Coding 
Changes for 2012
The new year will bring the addition 
of and change to several audiol-
ogy procedure codes, as well as to 
the annual Medicare Physician Fee 
Schedule. Join Debra Abel, AuD, to 
review these changes for compliance 
and correct coding practices. 
March 13—Insurance 101
With an increase of audiological 
and hearing aid services offered 
by commercial payers, join Frieda 
Toback, AuD, and Debra Abel, AuD, 
in a discussion of what to ask your 
payers as you navigate the muddy 
waters and chart the course for fair 
reimbursement. 
May 8—Preparing for the 
ICD-10 Code Transition
With the ICD-10 code transition set 
to begin on October 1, 2013, join Kyle 
Dennis, PhD, and Debra Abel, AuD, to 
prepare for the first coding change in 
the United States in 30 years. 
Take advantage of this valuable 
coding and reimbursement resource. 
Invite your peers to do the same.

We’ve come up with one of  
our slickest ideas yet.
I
t’s a fact—hearing instrument earpieces 
are breeding grounds for bacteria, fungi 
and other germs. Unfortunately, constantly 
disinfecting a patient’s earpiece is costly, 
troublesome, and often ineffective. 
Slick-Sil®  AM is the solution.
Slick-Sil AM (Anti-Microbial), a chemically 
bonded coating for silicone earpieces, 
is proven to be 99.9% effective* against 
bacteria, germs and other pathogens.
Slick-Sil AM also provides a new low-
friction surface finish for significantly 
easier insertion of silicone earpieces 
without lubricants.
You can now provide your patients 
with the combined benefits of bacterial 
protection and ease of insertion in a 
silicone earpiece.  We think you’ll agree, 
Slick-Sil AM is one of our slickest ideas yet.

Enhancing Patient Experience 
Through First Impressions 
By Tracey Irene
D
o you provide an exceptional 
customer service experience 
to your patients? Have you 
considered the impact of the front 
desk staff on your patients’ satisfac-
tion? The front desk staff is providing 
your patients’ first impressions 
of your practice. According to an 
article published in JAMA (Kenagy et 
al, 1999), “the initial direct interac-
tions with patients tend to strongly 
shape the experiences and emotions 
that will follow. When this initial 
moment of truth goes well, a positive 
cycle begins between the customer 
and the organization; when it goes 
poorly, it may be difficult to recover.” 
A knowledgeable staff can grow the 
practice and should be an integral 
component to the patient journey.
Evaluate how a patient flows 
through your office. What is the 
first impression a patient will form 
when he or she calls your office to 
schedule an appointment? Is the 
phone interaction positive, courteous, 
and responsive to the patient’s 
needs? Is the patient greeted warmly 
when visiting your practice and 
acknowledged when leaving?
What is your protocol for 
answering the phone? If your 
office does not have a protocol, a 
phone script can be developed to 
provide the following: a universal 
greeting, a method for answering 
questions, and a standard of care 
that is expected of the staff. Use 
examples to demonstrate appropriate 
phone interactions. Consider how 
the following interaction could be 
changed to improve the patient’s first 
impression of the office:
Front desk: “ABC Audiology, please 
hold” (followed by a two-minute wait). 
“How can I help you?” 
Ask your staff how they would feel 
if they were the caller? What could 
be changed about this interaction to 
improve the first impression? Small 
changes in the interaction lead to 
exemplary customer service.
Front desk: “Good morning, thank you 
for calling ABC Audiology. This is Jane. 
How can I help you?” After listening to 
the request, “I would be happy to help you 
with that, may I place you on hold for just 
a moment?” 
Discuss potential challenges 
front desk staff may encounter when

Know-how
answering the phone and working 
with patients. Train your staff to 
address patient questions and solve 
problems with knowledgeable and 
courteous answers. Be open to 
suggestions and change. Facilitating 
an environment of change requires 
the ability of staff to evaluate their 
performance and make changes to 
improve first impressions. Defining 
the expectations and working as a 
team to develop the necessary skills 
is important. You can facilitate this 
change by implementing some of  
the following:
	
Maintain good communication 
through open, honest, and con-
structive discussions.
	
Schedule monthly or quarterly 
meetings to review performance.
	
Record phone calls for training 
purposes and discuss the inter-
actions to promote continuous 
improvement.
	
Evaluate the performance through 
the patient perspective using a 
patient survey.
Change does not happen 
overnight; it is a process that 
requires continuous evaluation and 
consistent communication with 
the staff. Regular meetings offer 
the opportunity to open the lines 
of communication to ensure all 
employees are happy and providing 
the best service possible. 
In the ever-changing economy 
where medicine has progressed to 
a business model, we can no longer 
rely on our skills as health-care 
providers alone. The impressions 
that are formed by our patients go 
far beyond the tests we complete 
or services we provide. Patients 
are looking at the experience as a 
whole when deciding to allow us the 
opportunity to improve their lives. 
In the article, “Improving Service 
Quality in America: Lessons Learned” 
(Berry et al, 1994), the authors review 
the benefits of good service and  
note that 
Excellent service is a profit 
strategy because it results in 
more new customers, fewer 
lost customers, more insula-
tion from price competition, 
and fewer mistakes requiring 
the reperformance of services. 
Excellent service can also be 
energizing because it requires 
the building of an organiza-
tional culture in which people 
are challenged to perform to 
their potential and are rec-
ognized and rewarded when 
they do so.
Having a courteous staff is a 
reflection of you and the mission 
of the practice. It can create a 
positive work environment for 
both employees and patients. Your 
patients have a choice on where to 
receive and maintain their services. 
Patient loyalty is earned and not 
given. A life-long customer can grow 
your practice through word of mouth 
marketing. In contrast unhappy 
customers can lead to the demise of 
your practice. You may be amazing, 
but the overall service provided by 
all team members is what will set 
you apart from others. Strive for 
great first impressions, customer 
service and watch your practice grow 
through patient satisfaction.

Many of us feel a bit like the emperor and his subjects when  
it comes to clinical education in audiology. We have a nagging

O
nce upon a time, two men of poor character were 
hired to make an emperor a new suit of clothes. 
The suit of clothes was said to be made of a 
magnificent fabric, invisible to those who were intellectu-
ally challenged, incompetent, or unfit for their position. 
Naturally, the emperor’s advisors and subjects, as well as 
the emperor himself, all professed to see the fabric, which 
in truth, did not exist. Only a small child possessed the 
naivety to proclaim the emperor’s nakedness as he paraded 
down the street in his new finery. And in the end, everyone 
kept up the pretense, even though all secretly knew the truth.
Many of us feel a bit like the emperor and his subjects 
when it comes to clinical education in audiology. We 
have a nagging feeling that the whole enterprise does not 
quite make sense, even though we have all been through 
it at one point or another. Whether you are a student, a 
clinician, a clinical educator, or an academician, if you 
have thought this, you are not alone.

Clinical Education in Audiology
Clinical education involves numerous factors, each of 
which has evolved substantially in the past decade or two. 
So it is no surprise that we may feel a bit uneasy when it 
comes to understanding clinical education today. Some 
major challenges of clinical education include models 
for clinical education, credentialing of audiologists, and 
accreditation of academic programs.
The Evolution of the Master’s Degree 
to Doctoral Degree
Prior to the past decade, of course, a master’s degree was 
the entry level for clinical practice in audiology. An audi-
ology student would take courses in audiology and would 
receive some clinical instruction. Most students would 
graduate from a college of liberal arts and sciences or a 
college of education, generally from a joint speech-lan-
guage-pathology and audiology department. The degree 
would be nondescriptive, meaning that it did not desig-
nate that students were educated as audiologists. Instead, 
they would receive a degree such as master of arts, mas-
ter of science, or master of communication disorders (MA, 
MS, MCD, etc.). 
At the time that students graduated, it was generally 
agreed upon that they did not yet possess sufficient 
clinical skill to be qualified for independent practice. In 
order to complete their clinical education, the graduates 
would complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY). The 
purpose of the CFY was to allow the students to obtain 
clinical experience under the instruction and supervision 
of qualified audiologists.
The problem with the master’s model was that the 
quality of postgraduate training could differ tremendously. 
In addition to differences in clinical experiences and 
environments, the level and quality of supervision could 
vary. And in the end, there was no measure to ensure that 
the CFY student had, in fact, become a skilled clinician; 
there was merely an attestation by the clinical supervisor 
that the requisite number of supervised hours had been 
completed. 
By the 1990s audiologists were recognizing that they 
were not uniformly graduating with what they felt was 
sufficient didactic or clinical education to be autonomous 
members of the health-care profession. Thus began the 
movement toward the clinical doctorate (the AuD) as the 
entry level for clinical education. 
The doctoral model moved the responsibility for 
clinical education from the CFY clinical preceptor to the 
university, which provided at least some assurance that 
someone was watching over clinical education, even 
when it was not being provided by the university program 
directly.
Today when students graduate, they have an AuD 
(doctor of audiology) degree. The name of the degree 
signifies that the course of study was in audiology. In 
addition, the degree has been designed to entirely prepare 
students for entry-level clinical practice. In contrast to the 
master’s model, the AuD student is meant to be prepared 
to practice independently upon graduation.
The Evolution of Credentialing 
At the same time that changes were occurring in the 
educational programs, changes were also occurring in 
the credentialing of audiologists. Historically, the primary 
credential used to indicate that one was qualified as an 
audiologist was the Certificate of Clinical Competence in 
Audiology (CCC-A), conferred by the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). The requirements 
for certification are developed by the Council for Clinical

Clinical Education in Audiology
Certification (CFCC). This credential was granted 
following the completion of the CFY. 
Recall that at this point in the history of our profession, 
clinical education was not complete upon graduation. 
Certification was the vehicle by which audiologists could 
indicate that not only had they completed their academic 
preparation, demonstrated by their degree, but that they 
had completed a postgraduate period of clinical training 
as well. Because no other credential was available to 
indicate this, certification was necessary to establish the 
individual as a qualified audiologist among peers and 
consumers.
Over time more and more states began establishing 
licensure for audiologists. Licensing boards set standards 
for acquisition and maintenance of the professional 
license. By and large, the state licensing standards 
mirrored, and in some cases exceeded, the standards for 
ASHA certification in audiology. Licensure, rather than 
certification, provided audiologists the legal right to 
practice (see Table 1).
Currently, licensure for audiologists exists in every 
state. It is the standard credential necessary for clinical 
practice. Because audiologists now receive all clinical 
training during their doctoral program, students in nearly 
every state can graduate with their diploma, obtain a 
license in their state, and begin practicing. Certification 
has become an optional, adjunct credential, not necessary 
for clinical practice or reimbursement. 
The Evolution of Accreditation
Another major factor in clinical education is the accredi-
tation of academic programs in audiology. Accreditation 
is a process by which academic programs are evaluated 
to ensure that they have met certain quality standards. 
The accreditation of an academic program is technically 
voluntary, but because audiologists must have graduated 
from accredited programs in order to obtain licensure or 
certification, the programs have a de facto obligation to 
obtain and maintain accreditation. 
Historically, all audiology programs have been 
accredited by ASHA’s Council on Academic Accreditation 
(CAA). As audiology programs began to change from 
master’s level to doctoral level programs, changes 
needed to be made to the requirements for accreditation 
of audiology programs to reflect the goal of greater 
academic and clinical preparation of students. 
Many in the audiology community felt that the 
changes made to the CAA accreditation standards for 
clinical doctoral programs lacked the rigor necessary to 
substantially and meaningfully elevate the performance

of academic programs at producing clinical audiologists 
(CAA, 2011). The solution developed by these individuals 
was an alternative accrediting body, the Accreditation 
Commission for Audiology Education (ACAE), with a goal 
of creating a higher standard for the accreditation of 
clinical doctoral audiology programs.
Currently, there are 72 doctoral programs in audiology 
accredited by the CAA and four programs accredited 
by the ACAE. All ACAE-accredited programs are also 
accredited by the CAA.
Academic accrediting organizations obtain their 
authority to accredit programs from two main sources, 
the U.S. Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher 
Education Accreditation (CHEA). The CAA is recognized 
by both. The ACAE is recognized by the U.S. Secretary  
of Education and is currently undergoing initial review  
by CHEA.
Requirements for Clinical Education
One of the biggest challenges in audiology clinical 
education is that the standards differ depending on who 
you ask. It is the job of university programs to educate 
students. In order to do this, they create standards and 
curriculum for the education of their students. 
In theory, the accrediting body ensures that the 
university program is meeting certain widely accepted 
standards through the accreditation process. So the 
accrediting body has a separate set of standards.
For CAA-accredited programs there is a third level of 
standards, that of certification of the clinician. Why does 
certification play a role in clinical education requirements 
at the level of the university program? Well, the answer is 
that it should not. 
Typically, certification is a credential that is earned 
through additional study and skill development, beyond 
that required for graduation from the academic program 
and entry into the profession. Think of the board-certified 
otolaryngologists with whom you may have worked. 
Following completion of their graduation from medical 
school, where they earn their doctor of medicine (MD) 
degree, they complete rigorous residency and fellowship 
training programs, at the end of which they may become 
board certified in otolaryngology. The same model holds 
true for most professions, including speech-language 
pathology, wherein certification is granted only following 
postgraduate clinical instruction in the form of the CFY. 
This also used to be the case in the master’s-degree 
model for audiology education.
Figure 1. The mandate for certification as a credential for clinical education.
“Applicants for certification must 
complete a program of study that 
includes academic course work 
and a minimum of 1,820 hours of 
supervised clinical practicum…. 
The supervision must be provided 
by individuals who hold the ASHA 
Certificate of Clinical Competence 
(CCC) in Audiology” (CFCC, 2011).
“The program must ensure that 
students…qualify for relevant 
state and national credentials” 
(CAA, 2011).
Therefore, the university program is 
compelled to provide clinical education 
by those who hold the CCC-A.

Clinical Education in Audiology
Why does certification play a role in clinical 
education requirements at the level of the 
university program?  
Well, the answer is that it should not. 
With the advent of the AuD degree, the most common 
certification in audiology, the CCC-A, has become 
redundant with academic requirements for graduation. In 
other words, in order to graduate and earn a diploma in 
audiology, the audiology student must necessarily have 
completed the requirements for certification.
So how did CCC-A certification go from being a 
postgraduate credential to being redundant with the 
diploma? The answer lies in the CAA’s standards for 
clinical education. Specifically, the CAA (2011) states that 
“the program must ensure that students … qualify for 
relevant state and national credentials.” 
This CAA standard raises a few questions. One 
question regards what exactly is meant by “national 
credentials.” There is no state-level certification of 
audiologists, so presumably “state credentials” refers 
to licensure. There is no national audiology license, 
so national credentialing is presumably certification. 
But what form of certification is necessary? There 
are numerous potential certifications available to 
audiologists, including the American Board of Audiology 
(ABA) certification, various specialty certifications, and 
ASHA certification. Must students qualify for all of these 
national certifications? Or perhaps one? Which one(s)? 
Because answers to these questions are not clear, 
university programs are left to guess at how they might 
fulfill this requirement. Most university programs 
assume that the answer is that students must be eligible 
for ASHA certification in audiology upon graduation. 
Those few programs that do not require students to fulfill 
this particular certification requirement generally have 
students sign a waiver indicating their awareness that 
they will not have completed these requirements upon 
graduation.
Another important question is “Why would audiology 
students be required to be qualified for certification 
when they graduate?” In the past, audiologists used to 
be eligible for certification only following additional 
postgraduate study. Speech-language pathologists, whose 
programs are also accredited by the CAA, are only eligible 
following postgraduate study. This is the case in nearly 
every other profession. 
So why would qualification for audiology certification 
be necessary upon graduation? There is no clear answer 
to this question, although we might find some clues in 
the CFCC requirements for certification in audiology. 
One major requirement for CCC-A certification is that 
“applicants for certification must complete a program 
of study that includes academic course work and a 
minimum of 1,820 hours of supervised clinical practicum” 
(CFCC, 2011). The requirement further states that “the 
supervision must be provided by individuals who hold 
the ASHA Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) 
in Audiology” (CFCC, 2011). In addition, the CFCC has 
clarified that these clinical education requirements must 
be completed during the student’s academic program 
(personal communication with chair of CFCC). According 
to the current requirements, if the student does not 
qualify for certification upon graduation, they never will.
So, university programs that follow the assumption 
that students must be eligible for ASHA certification upon 
graduation are compelled to ensure that their students 
receive 1,820 hours of clinical education provided by 
ASHA-certified audiologists (see Figure 1). 
A Bottleneck for Clinical Education
The de facto “requirement” that university programs 
must provide clinical education from individuals who 
hold the CCC-A creates a number of problems for clinical 
education. One problem is that it creates a bottleneck for 
access to clinical education for audiology students.
Audiologists no longer need certification to practice. 
Therefore, many audiologists may choose not to maintain 
or pursue certification for various reasons. This is 

SepOct2011 | Audiology Today
25
Clinical Education in Audiology
especially likely to be true for new audiologists, who 
are graduating into a profession of licensure and have 
never had the experience of needing certification to 
practice. And because the requirements for certification 
are redundant with the graduate’s diploma, entry-
level certification does nothing to set the audiologist 
apart from peers. So they may see little value in paying 
additionally and annually for the certification.
Unfortunately this means that a large number of 
audiologists are ineligible to provide clinical training for 
the 1,820 hours that the CFCC requires for certification 
of audiologists. This situation has created a strain on the 
abilities of university programs to find sufficient numbers 
of high-quality clinical education sites; a situation that is 
likely to worsen in the future.
A recent Internet-based survey completed by the 
author and colleagues was distributed to the clinical 
education coordinators, those people responsible for 
the external clinical education experiences of audiology 
students, at 71 AuD programs in the United States. The 
goal of the survey was to understand the thoughts and 
experiences of these professionals as they tackle the 
difficult task of recruiting and maintaining appropriate 
clinical educators.
Encouragingly, when asked whether they felt that 
their students currently had sufficient access to quality 
external clinical education placements, 91 percent 
responded affirmatively. However, 70 percent of these 
same respondents reported that they are also concerned 
about maintaining or obtaining sufficient access to 
quality external clinical education placements in the near 
future. And 38 percent of respondents reported that they 
have recently noticed decreases in the number of external 
clinical placements available to their students.
One important reason that many university 
programs may be experiencing decreases in the number 
of clinical placements is the CFCC requirement for 
clinical educators to maintain the CCC-A. When asked 
whether there were external clinical placement sites 
that the clinical education coordinators felt would 
provide fruitful learning experiences for students, but 
which were not utilized solely due to the requirement

Clinical Education in Audiology
for ASHA-certification of clinical educators, 56 percent 
of respondents said, “yes.” Fifty-six percent of our 
university programs are reporting that they are being 
forced to choose between quality clinical education and 
certification, and they are choosing certification.
A Lack of Evidence
If certification of the clinical educator ensured quality 
clinical education for the student, the requirement would 
be justified regardless of the bottleneck that it creates. 
However, it is clear to most that generalist certification 
does nothing to ensure quality for clinical education. 
When the clinical education coordinators mentioned 
previously were asked whether they believed that 
the requirements for obtaining ASHA certification 
in audiology, beyond the requirements necessary for 
licensure in their state, helped to prepare audiologists 
to be effective clinical educators, the response was 
overwhelmingly “no” (75 percent).
The CFCC requirements make no mention of training 
or study in the art and science of clinical education, for 
either obtaining or maintaining certification (CFCC, 
2011). And the question is really intuitively simple. If 
you are a great clinical educator and decide to drop your 
certification, does this automatically make you a poor 
clinical educator? If you are a poor clinical educator, 
does the decision to pay for your certification annually 
transform you into a good clinical educator?
Furthermore, there is little to no evidence to support 
the notion that certification does anything to make one 
a competent clinical educator, yet it is the single most 
utilized qualification for clinical educators, not formal 
training in methods and theory of clinical education; 
not review of the literature on clinical education; not 
mentorship by university faculty or experienced clinical 
educators; not even an arbitrary number of years of 
clinical experience. The most universal requirement for a 
clinical educator is possession of entry-level certification 
in audiology.
Indeed, the reliance on generalist, entry-level 
certification as a qualification for clinical educators is 
also troublesome because it lulls us into believing that we 
have a meaningful method for choosing and evaluating 
who will provide clinical education to our students, when 
this is far from the case.
A Conflict of Interest?
We have no meaningful reason to believe that require-
ments for clinical educators to have entry-level 
certification improve clinical education. In fact, they 
may have a negative impact by limiting the number of 
qualified clinicians available to provide clinical education. 
Given this situation, we must wonder why the “require-
ment” for ASHA certification of clinical educators exists.
ASHA’s CAA standards for students to graduate 
prepared for national certification and ASHA’s CFCC 
requirement that students must graduate having had 
clinical supervision provided by an ASHA-certified 
audiologist in order to qualify for certification has 
every appearance of a conflict of interest. We must ask 
ourselves, “Is the CAA working together with the CFCC 
to use the clinical education of students as a means to 
maintain audiology certification by ASHA?” 
If not, why is certification treated so differently by the 
CFCC for audiology and for speech-language pathology? 
For decades, certification was treated similarly for 
these two professions, with applicants able to obtain 
certification following postgraduate training. This model 
is still utilized by speech-language pathology, but now 
audiology applicants may not obtain clinical training 
as a postgraduate for this purpose. The training must 
occur during the academic program. What rational 
explanation can there be for this? Could it be that ASHA-
certified audiologists who are not under the purview of 
the university, who provided postgraduate training for 
years, are no longer capable of doing this? Could it be 
that the CFCC views ASHA-certified speech-language 
pathologists as fit to provide postgraduate training but 
Certification has become an optional, adjunct 
credential, not necessary for clinical practice  
or reimbursement. 

SepOct2011 | Audiology Today

Clinical Education in Audiology
ASHA-certified audiologists as unfit? Or could it be that 
by forcing university programs to provide ASHA-certified 
clinical hours, rather than allowing students to choose 
this particular training qualification for themselves, the 
CFCC and CAA are seeking to compel audiologists, who 
might otherwise not, to obtain and maintain certification, 
simply for the purpose of having the option to provide 
clinical training to students?
We might also wonder why the CFCC requires 
that, after January 1, 2012, audiologists who drop their 
certification for any period of time will be required to 
have a doctoral degree for reinstatement of certification. 
If you are a qualified master’s-level audiologist and 
you choose not to maintain your certification, why 
would you be considered unqualified for entry-level 
practice upon choosing to reinstate your certification? 
If you are competent to practice today, why would you 
be incompetent a year from now simply because you 
decided not to pay for the certificate? Could the purpose 
for these particular changes be to scare audiologists 
into maintaining their certification and to scare young 
audiology students into pursuing a certificate?
We have a right to expect clear and legitimate answers 
to these questions.
Looking Forward
Whether you are a current or former student, a clinical 
educator, or an academic instructor, if you have been 
confused by the process of clinical education, it is with 
good reason. 
The goal of good clinical education is not merely a nice 
wish, important only to current students and academic 
faculty. The ability to demonstrate consistency and 
effectiveness in clinical education is an absolute necessity 
for continued recognition as an autonomous and serious 
health-care profession. We all have a stake in ensuring 
excellence in clinical education, and we can all contribute 
to the improvement of clinical education in audiology.
Clinical educators can insist on clear information from 
university programs regarding the goals and expectations 
for students entering and exiting their clinical training 
sites. This will, at the very least, provide direction to 
the clinical education of students. Importantly, clinical 
educators can also insist on being included in the national 
discussion on clinical education. Clinical education 
standards and methods have traditionally been decided 
upon by academic institutions, with little input from 
those who are actually providing the bulk of clinical 
education—and who are almost invariably volunteering 
their time and efforts. Clinical educators have a primary 
commitment to their patients and practices. There are 
certain real-world realities that clinical educators must 
face, including billing issues, attitudes and behaviors of 
the Millennial-generation students, and time constraints, 
to which university programs simply must be responsive.
University programs can insist on clear information 
from accrediting bodies. University faculties are a 
powerful force in our profession. When the requirements 
of accrediting agencies conflict with the ability of 
university programs to provide the best clinical education 
for students, they must hold accrediting agencies 
accountable rather than submitting to unproductive 
standards.
All of us, students, clinicians, and faculty, can ask 
questions of ourselves, our institutions, and our national 
organizations. We can also insist that priority be given 
to establishing an evidence base for clinical education 
outcomes and processes for the purpose of establishing 
meaningful and effective standards and methods. 
We cannot afford to stand by, failing to notice our own 
nakedness, while the procession goes on.

In the mid–1990s, several 
investigators observed  
that particular neurons  
in the vestibular system  
of cats, called “irregular 
neurons,” were activated 
by low-frequency acoustic 
stimulation. This led some 
to investigate the possibility 
of using acoustic stimulation 
to measure the function  
of the vestibular system.
In the mid–1960s, a group of investigators 
headed by Dr. Thane Cody reported, in 
response to high intensity click stimulation, 
that it was possible to record an evoked 
potential with an active electrode placed at the occipital 
protuberance. The response had all of the characteristics 
of a sound-evoked muscle reflex, i.e., a sonomotor response. 
Most interestingly, the response could be recorded in 
anacusic patients but could not be recorded from indi-
viduals with profound vestibular system impairments 
(Bickford et al, 1964). For these reasons the investigators 
felt that the response, called the “inion potential,” 
ema­nated from the peripheral vestibular system. 
However it would be three decades before vestibular 
evoked myogenic potentials would become clinically useful.
Background of the oVEMP
In the mid–1990s, several investigators observed that 
particular neurons in the vestibular system of cats, called 
“irregular neurons,” were activated by low-frequency 
acoustic stimulation (McCue and Guinan, 1994). The 
irregular neurons were mainly found in the otolith 
organs—the saccule and utricle. This led some to inves-
tigate the possibility of using acoustic stimulation to 
measure the function of the vestibular system. Colebatch

and colleagues published some of the first VEMP findings 
in 1992 and 1994 wherein they described a click-evoked 
response emanating from a contracted sternocleido-
mastoid muscle (SCM). The response was recordable in 
patients with severe sensoneural hearing loss (SNHL) and 
intact vestibular function, and absent in individuals who 
had undergone vestibular nerve section. They concluded 
that the response was not cochlear but of vestibular 
origin. Given the fact that the otolith organs could be 
activated with sound and the saccule had specific projec-
tions to the SCM, they concluded that this vestibular 
evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) recorded from the SCM 
(cervical VEMP or cVEMP) was generated by the saccule. A 
simple method to assess the saccule and inferior ves-
tibular nerve appealed to many clinicians and the cVEMP 
quickly found its place in the contemporary balance func-
tion examination.
While the cVEMP grew in popularity, VEMPs recorded 
from other muscles, e.g., extraocular muscles, masse-
ter, trapezius, received little attention. In 2004, a VEMP 
recorded from electrodes placed beneath the eyes, 
the ocular VEMP (oVEMP), was introduced at the XXIII 
International Congress of the Barany Society as a pos-
sible clinical test of vestibular function. However, journal 
reviewers were skeptical as to whether the response was 
myogenic or neurogenic, vestibular or cochlear, or an 
artifact of the eye blink reflex. It took another three years 
before the first research paper on the oVEMP was pub-
lished (Todd et al, 2007). Like the cVEMP, the oVEMP was 
present in deaf individuals with normal vestibular system 
function and absent in individuals with normal hearing 
who had undergone vestibular nerve sections. The oVEMP 
represented a novel way to assess the vestibular system 
and researchers now wanted to know how to record this 
new vestibular evoked response, what was its normal 
appearance, its peripheral and central origins, and how it 
would contribute to vestibular electroneurodiagnostics. 
Our lab was also interested in this and in 2008 we began 
a project examining the normal characteristics of the 
oVEMP across age groups.
Recording oVEMPs
To record an oVEMP, the non-inverting (active) electrodes 
are placed beneath the eyes. The ground is placed at Fz 
and the inverting (reference) electrodes can be placed 
directly beneath each non-inverting electrode (see Figure 
1), or conversely, in a neutral location such as the chin. 
The stimulus can be the same as that used to evoke the 
cVEMP, e.g., 95 dB nHL 500 Hz tone burst, but the bioelec-
trical activity must be amplified by a factor of 100k (as 
Figure 2: Two-channel recording of an oVEMP waveform 
in response to a 500 Hz tone burst presented to the left ear. 
Channel one is recording from beneath the contralateral eye 
and channel two is recording from beneath the ipsilateral 
eye. This patient shows both a contralateral and ipsilateral 
oVEMP, but the contralateral waveform is significantly larger 
in amplitude.

the common recommended infra-orbital bipolar electrode

opposed to ~5k for the much larger cVEMP). The response 
can be extracted from the background interference in as 
little as 100–200 sweeps. However, the response is greatest 
in magnitude when the patient gazes at an upward target 
placed ~30 degrees above midline during signal averaging. 
The upward gaze brings the inferior oblique muscle closer 
to the location of the infraorbital active electrode. 
We recorded oVEMPs from the ipsilateral and con-
tralateral inferior oblique muscles in 50 otologically and 
neurologically normal adults and children (Piker et al, 
2011). The oVEMP began between 10–12 msec as a nega-
tive-positive going waveform. The first negative peak was 
labeled N1, i.e. some investigators label it N10 to cor-
respond to the peak’s median latency, and the following 
positive peak, which occurs around 15–17 msec, is labeled 
P1, i.e. some label this peak P15. Compared to the cVEMP, 
the oVEMP was small, i.e. mean amplitude = 5µV ± 3, and 
was best recorded from the contralateral inferior oblique 
muscle, e.g. stimulus presented to the right ear with the 
response recorded best from beneath the left eye. Only 25 
percent of subjects generated an ipsilateral response.
Response Characteristics of oVEMPs 
Figure 2 shows an example of an oVEMP recorded from 
an individual who generated both a contralateral and 
ipsilateral oVEMP, though the contralateral is significantly 
larger in amplitude. The upper limit of oVEMP amplitude 
asymmetry between ears, defined as the mean plus two 
standard deviations, was 34 percent (mean = 14 percent, 
sd 10 percent). We also found that test-retest reliability 
was acceptable. oVEMP amplitude was found to have 
excellent reliability whereas oVEMP latency measures, 
threshold, and interaural amplitude asymmetry measures 
were found to have fair-to-good reliability. 
oVEMP responses were present in both ears in 90 percent 
of our subjects. Others have reported 90–100 percent 
response rates, though each of these studies was limited 
to a small number of subjects, all less than 35 years of 
age. When we examined our younger cohort we found a 
100 percent response rate for subjects younger than age 
50, whereas the response rate was only 77 percent for 
subjects over the age of 50 years. Further, the amplitude of 
the response significantly decreased while the threshold 
significantly increased with increasing age, i.e., similar 
to the age effects seen with the cVEMP. The greatest age 
effects were observed in subjects 50 years and older. 
Another goal of our study was to examine whether 
or not reference contamination in the oVEMP recording 
occurred using the commonly recommended electrode 
derivations such as that shown in Figure 1. Ideally, the

reference, i.e., inverting, input in a bipolar derivation 
should contain none of the evoked potential, i.e., the 
signal. The purpose of the reference electrode input is to 
record only non-stimulus related distant common electri-
cal noise, e.g., 60 Hz interference, that is “viewed” with 
identical phase and amplitude at the two inputs of a bipo-
lar recording. “Reference contamination” occurs when the 
reference electrode is located within the electrical field 
of the evoked potential. When this occurs, the stimulus-
related electrical activity—both positive and negative in 
polarity—will algebraically add and subtract with activity 
that is recorded from that active electrode input. In the 
extreme, if both the active electrode and the reference 
electrodes record the evoked potential with equal phase 
and magnitude, a cancellation of the response will occur. 
In these situations, the reference electrode is not a neutral 
“indifferent” electrode.
For the oVEMP, it has been a common recommenda-
tion, e.g., Todd et al, 2007, for the active (non-inverting) 
input electrode to be placed infraorbitally and the 
reference (inverting) input electrode to be placed two to 
three cm inferior to the active electrode (Figure 1). Using 
this recommended bipolar montage we found evidence of 
reference contamination. The mean oVEMP amplitude in 
a sample of 10 young subjects when the -1 cm infraorbital 
electrode was referenced to the -3 cm infraorbital elec-
trode was 6.85 µV and significantly increased to a mean of 
9.64 µV when a chin reference was employed. As such, the 
chin or a non-cephalic reference may represent a more 
indifferent reference location, particularly in cases where 
the amplitude of the oVEMP is small. 
Our findings suggest that the oVEMP is well-tolerated, 
simple to administer, and present in the majority of 
normal subjects, i.e., at least under the age of 50. Both 
the saccule and utricle are activated with intense acous-
tic stimulation and several investigators have recently 
argued that the oVEMP most likely represents a stimulus 
synchronized increase in EMG activity from the inferior 
oblique muscle. The peripheral end organ of the oVEMP, 
i.e., utricle, secule, or both) is still being debated.

oVEMPs as an Additional Measure  
of Utricular Function
While it is widely accepted that the caloric examination 
is a measure of horizontal semicircular canal (SCC) and 
superior vestibular nerve function, and the cVEMP mea-
sures the integrity of the saccule and inferior vestibular 
nerve, there is still debate in the literature regarding the 
precise peripheral generators of the oVEMP, i.e., the utri-
cle, saccule, or both. It has been generally accepted that 
oVEMPs elicited with a bone conduction or vibratory stim-
ulus emanate from the utricle (for review see Curthoys, 
2010). The responsiveness of the utricle to air conduction 
stimuli has not been researched as thoroughly as the 
saccule, and the origins of the air conduction oVEMP are 
still questioned by some (Welgampola and Carey, 2010). 
However, Curthoys and Vulovic (2010) recently showed 
definitively that neurons in the utricle do in fact respond 
to acoustic stimulation. Further, the utricle has strong 
projections to the extraocular muscles, whereas the sac-
cule has few projections to these muscles. Additionally, 
accepted measures of utricular function seem to cor-
relate with the results of the air conduction oVEMP. For 
example, in patients with vestibular system pathologies 
the rate of abnormal oVEMPs is very similar to the rate 
of abnormal SVV tests (Govender and Rosengren, 2011). 
The subjective visual vertical (SVV) test is a technique 
that employs rotational testing to assess the functional 
integrity of the utricle. Along these lines, patients with 
superior vestibular neuritis who have normal cVEMPs, i.e., 
normal inferior vestibular nerve, tend to have abnormal 
caloric exams and abnormal oVEMPs, both of which rely 
on an intact superior vestibular nerve. In other words, 
patients with abnormal utricular examinations, e.g., SVV, 
or abnormalities affecting the superior vestibular nerve, 
e.g., caloric exam, also have abnormal oVEMPs, suggesting 
that the tests are measuring the same thing, i.e. utricular 
and/or superior vestibular nerve function. Interestingly, 
in several recent studies, it has been shown that oVEMPs 
correlate poorly with cVEMP test results, showing that 
patients with abnormal saccule and/or inferior vestibular 
nerve function often have normal oVEMP responses. This 
is additional evidence indicating that oVEMP responses 
provide unique information relative to the other diagnos-
tic vestibular tests available in the clinic (Govender and 
Rosengren, 2011; Lin and Young, 2011; Valko et al, 2011). 
The oVEMP’s Role in the Contemporary 
Balance Function Examination
The studies previously described make a strong case for 
the oVEMP being an appropriate technique to evaluate the 
functional integrity of the utricle and superior vestibular 
nerve. With the addition of the oVEMP to the vestibular 
test battery, a new and unique piece of information is 
now available to the clinician assessing the dizzy patient. 
This recent addition to the balance function test battery 
affords the examiner the ability to evaluate three of the 
five vestibular end-organs, i.e., the horizontal semicircu-
lar canal, utricle, and saccule, thereby providing a level 
of detail not previously possible. For example, when the 
responses derived from quantitative balance tests, i.e., 
cVEMP, oVEMP, and caloric testing, are absent in a patient, 
it can be inferred that the patient suffers from impair-
ments of the horizontal semicircular canal, utricle, and 
saccule, or, inferior and superior vestibular nerves, i.e. the 
caveat being that middle ear function must be normal and 
the patient has to be neurologically intact. Additionally, 
the presence of a normal cVEMP with absent caloric and 
oVEMP responses suggests that there is an impairment 
affecting the superior vestibular nerve (or, less likely, an 
end organ impairment that selectively affects the utricle 
and horizontal semicircular canal, Figure 3). 
Conversely, an absent cVEMP with a normal caloric 
test and normal oVEMP suggests an impairment of the 
saccule or inferior vestibular nerve. When these three 
tests of balance function are evaluated there are poten-
tially nine different variations or diagnostic “types” 
depending on the location(s) of the impairment (See Table 
1). In fact, our clinic has documented all nine different 
patterns of abnormality. It is interesting that, over the 
While the cVEMP grew 
in popularity, VEMPs 
recorded from other 
muscles, e.g., extraocular 
muscles, masseter, 
trapezius, received  
little attention.

past two years, there has been an increase in interest 
over “diagnostic patterns” that are formed by the results 
of caloric, cVEMP and oVEMP test results (Manzari et al, 
2010; Manzari et al, 2010a; Manzari et al, 2010b; Murofushi 
et al; Jacobson et al, 2011). For instance, in a recent report 
by Jacobson et al. (2011), the authors illustrated the most 
common cVEMP, oVEMP, and caloric patterns of abnor-
mality. The authors presented three case reports that 
described one patient with a vestibular nerve section, a 
patient with a superior vestibular neuritis, and a patient 
with a diagnosis of Meniere’s disease affecting, at least, 
the saccule. For the second and third cases they showed 
that the cVEMP and oVEMP can vary independent of one 
another, and in that way provide topological information 
about the sites of impairment. It was their contention 
that with caloric, oVEMP, and cVEMP tests, it is possible to 
augment the diagnostic information that balance clinics 
currently provide regarding the location or locations of 
vestibular system impairment. 
Conclusion
Even though the peripheral origins of the air conduction 
oVEMP are currently somewhat controversial (Curthoys, 
2010; Rosengren et al, 2010) numerous studies have 
provided evidence in which oVEMP results in response to 
air conduction stimulation differ from cVEMP results in 
response to air conduction stimulation but were con-
sistent with results from a caloric examination. These 
findings suggest that air conduction oVEMPs measure a 
part of the peripheral vestibular system different from 
that measured by cVEMPs, perhaps the utricle, and 
similar to that measured by caloric testing, the superior 
portion of the vestibular nerve. The oVEMP test is easy 
to administer and interpret, provides valuable diagnostic 
information, and is quickly finding its place in the con-
temporary balance function examination.

O
ver 10 years ago, we began to ponder the myth 
that unbundling is bad for business. The litera-
ture on the topic of unbundling dates back over 
a decade. Toni Gitles discussed the consumer’s 
view of the audiologist as one of a sales or 
service person, not a professional (1999a). Today, there 
are more hearing aid distribution channels than ever 
before. Many of these channels suggest to consumers that 
the professional expertise of the audiologist is unneces-
sary. The most popular method of billing in audiology has 
certainly not helped to separate the importance of the 
professional from the limitations of the device. 
In 2003, Dennis Van Vliet, stated, “bundled pricing 
does not offer a full accounting of the clear scope of our 
services” (Van Vliet, 2003). In 2009, Robert Sweetow led 
an American Academy of Audiology task force to look at 
current hearing aid delivery models. In a two-part article, 
featured in Audiology Today, he discussed the advan-
tages of unbundling and the ability to use a fair and yet 
unbundled-only schedule to promote professional and 
specialized services. The task force also suggested that 
unbundling could be used to argue for proper reim-
bursement, which would differentiate audiologists from 
non-audiologists who dispense. Finally and perhaps most 
importantly, the task force emphasized that audiologists

should never give away professional services for the pur-
pose of selling a product (Sweetow, 2009b).  
While the topic of hearing care billing practices has 
been discussed with many arguments in favor of an 
unbundled model, published data related to successful 
unbundling has been sparse...until now. The audiology 
community has seen little, if any, data related to clini-
cal practice that might entice one to adopt a new billing 
model, especially a model that many perceive would 
adversely affect business. We hope to dispel some of 
the main concerns or “myths” related to unbundling 
hearing aid prices by sharing 10 years of data from the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Hearing and 
Communication Center (UNC-HCC). 
Disclaimer: This exercise has been completed by 
trained professionals. Do not attempt to unbundle if you 
have not read this entire article. All kidding aside, we 
must clarify that the UNC-HCC is a non-profit clinic and 
although a university training clinic for doctoral students 
of audiology, the clinic is self-supported. The clinic is 
located in the community and receives no state funding, 
thus it functions essentially like a private practice clinic. 
The UNC-HCC has its own budget, and must pay rent, 
overhead, salaries, etc. The UNC-HCC is facing the same 
economic challenges as clinics in the private sector, and 
the training program is becoming more reliant on revenue 
generated by clinical services to help off-set academic 
program expenses.
Thoughts to Ponder
When we began to think about our billing practices, we 
had several discussions that led to the following questions: 
	
Why do we have days where we see fifteen patients, 
but bring in no revenue? 
	
Why are we often reluctant to charge patients for our 
time and expertise? 
	
How should we handle the patient who purchased 
hearing aids on the Internet and now wants us to  
program them? 
	
What is our time was worth? 
	
We began to wonder, “Is there a better way to bill 
for services that will assign value to what we do as 
audiologists?”

Survey Says
In collaboration with the American Academy of Audiology, 
we developed the Hearing Aid Billing Practices Survey, which 
was distributed to the entire membership in January 
2011. There was a 10 percent response rate warrant-
ing 1,589 responses from across the country. From this 
national effort we learned, to no surprise, that 80 percent 
of clinicians continue to bundle professional services into 
the cost of the hearing device (Figure 1). Only 20 percent 
of respondents indicated that at least some portion of 
professional services were separate from the cost of 
the hearing aid(s). In a survey of dispensers conducted 
in January 2004, by The Hearing Journal and Audiology 
Online, 86 percent of 666 respondents said they include 
service charges in the cost of the hearing aids they sell, 
while 14 percent said they charge separately for services. 
Ninety-three percent of hearing aid specialists said they 
bundled, compared with 84 percent of audiologists in 
general and 87 percent of audiologists in private practice 
(Nemes, 2004). In the seven years between these two 
surveys, there seems to be more buzz surrounding the 
topic of unbundling, however, there appears to be no 
significant movement toward unbundling in the audiol-
ogy community.
To further understand the current hearing aid delivery 
models, the Academy Hearing Aid Billing Practices Survey 
asked the following question: If your clinic does bundle 
services, for what period of time are the professional 
services included? Interestingly, 39 percent responded 
that services are included in the price of the device for the 
life of the hearing aid(s) (Figure 2). This indicates that once 
a hearing aid is dispensed, the patient can come back as 
often as he or she would like without paying for services 
or parts. Whether it be two times per year or 15 times per 
year, the audiologist does not collect another penny, until 
that patient is ready to purchase a new set of hearing aids. 
Over the years, anecdotal discussions suggest several 
obstacles faced by the professional when moving from a 
bundled to an unbundled billing model. Some common 
concerns associated with changing billing structure include:
	
The majority of individuals in clinical practice are not 
unbundling service fees from the cost of the product.
	
It is simpler to bundle all fees into the price of  
the product.
	
The clinic will lose money and go out of business.
	
Unbundling is a new phenomenon that requires  
some homework. 
	
The audiologist may be unsure of how to determine 
the cost of doing business and establish a price struc-
ture/super bill.
	
The audiologist may be unsure of how to bill for  
services separately.
	
Patients are comfortable with the current model and 
will not return if one makes changes and assigns fees 
for needed services.

Myth Busters: Can You Unbundle and Stay in Business?
The 2011 Hearing Aid Billing Practices Survey asked audiolo-
gists to rank the obstacles associated with unbundling or 
itemizing professional services from the acquisition cost 
of hearing aids from most to least significant (Figure 3). 
The survey found that the majority of individuals believed 
the two most significant obstacles were: 
1.	 	Patients will not return to the clinic for the needed 
services if there was a charge involved. 
2.	 	Audiologists report it simpler to bundle all fees into 
the price of the device.
Testing the Myth
To establish whether unbundling can be successful 
without the clinic going bankrupt, without losing patients, 
and regardless of whether the competition is unbundled, 
it seems prudent to outline the steps that allowed the 
UNC-HCC to move to an unbundled model. The move to 
unbundling in this scenario was a slow process over a 
long period of time. 
Step One: Charging a Hearing Aid  
Dispensing Fee
The first step was to start charging a fee for the hearing 
aid dispensing process. Prior to 2001, if a patient returned 
the hearing aid(s) at the conclusion of the “trial period” 
we retained nothing for the services rendered during the 
“trial period.” We arbitrarily chose the rumored going rate 
of $200 for this dispensing fee. This move was prompted 
in part as the move to the professional doctorate was 
picking up speed. We were in the planning stages for our 
first clinical doctoral cohort at UNC-Chapel Hill. As a 
group, we felt it was absurd not to charge for our time if 
the patient chose not to keep the hearing aids as valuable 
services had been rendered.
Step Two: Charging for Services  
Following the Warranty Period
The next step we took was to cease giving away services 
once the manufacturer’s warranty period had concluded. 
At our clinic, the purchase agreement clearly outlined the 
duration of covered services. However, we sometimes had 
a hard time charging patients once the manufacturer’s 
warranty expired. A discussion with a patient of ours who 
was a retired faculty dentist encouraged us to recognize 
that our services had value, and we should not hesitate 
to charge our patients. At this point, we arbitrarily chose 
an hourly rate and began to apply to all patients coming 
to the clinic for service and in-house repairs. The hourly 
rate we chose was concomitant to a recent visit from the 
plumber who seemed to have no problem charging $80.00 
to walk in the door to diagnosis a plumbing problem.

Myth Busters: Can You Unbundle and Stay in Business?
Step Three: Charging for the Hearing Aid 
Evaluation Appointment
The next step was to start charging for the hearing aid 
evaluation (HAE) appointment (92590/92591). There was 
much discussion about this among the audiology team 
at our clinic. Some of our senior clinicians were used to 
“bundling” the HAE into the hearing aid price. However, 
the bottom line was if the patient did not purchase the 
hearing aids, then we gave them an hour of services for 
free. How could we, as a training clinic, suggest to our 
students that they are becoming doctors of audiology to 
“give away their services?”
Step Four: The Unbundling Begins 
In 2005, we were inspired by Patricia Gans’s partially 
unbundled model. This unique model included services 
for the duration of the “trial period” then fee for service 
henceforth (Nemes, 2004). In this model, the patient pays 
upfront professional fees that include quality assurance, 
the initial fitting, and two to three follow-up visits within 
the first 45 days. We agree with the argument that a com-
pletely unbundled model may lead to less than optimal 
fitting should a patient forego certain procedures or visits 
in an effort to save money. Therefore, we have a clinic 
policy regarding key services that are non-negotiable 
(i.e,. electroacoustic analysis, probe-mic measures, etc). 
When fitting hearing aids, we look to the Guidelines for the 
Audiologic Management of Adult Hearing Impairment estab-
lished by the American Academy of Audiology (Academy, 
2006). We find that when patients are informed of best 
practice and evidence-based measures, they are agree-
able to undergo the necessary procedures and return for 
the follow-up visits. We also find it quite natural to charge 
patients for all visits because we are using evidence-
based practice. The partially unbundled model has proven 
to be a happy medium. It separates the fee for services 
from the device, establishes value for the professional 
expertise of the audiologist, and sets the stage for a suc-
cessful fitting. 
Let’s take a moment now to dispel a myth that 
patients will not return to the clinic if they are charged 
for services outside of the purchase price of the hear-
ing aid. We pulled 15 patient charts at random from our 
database and evaluated the number of times each person 
visited our clinic every year (Figure 4). Prior to unbundling, 
the average number of visits across our patients through 
the 2004 fiscal year was 6.06 visits annually. We then 
averaged all patients following the move to an unbundled 
billing model in 2005 and calculated the average to be 6.79 
visits per year between 2005 and 2009. This myth is busted! 
We have not seen a decrease in the number of patient visits at 
the UNC-HCC when fees are collected for professional service 
outside of the purchase price of the hearing aid.
Step Five: The Functional Communication 
Assessment 
In 2008, we moved from a hearing aid evaluation appoint-
ment to a functional communication assessment (FCA), 
using both objective and subjective methods for develop-
ing a treatment plan for the patient (Sweetow, 2007). We 
were already billing patients separately for this service, 
but adopted a more scientific basis to the selection of the 
hearing instruments and the development of a treatment 
plan beyond amplification. We also began to charge for 
earmold impressions (V5275) and earmolds (V5264) at the 
HAE/FCA appointment. This was to ensure that if patients 
elected to cancel the hearing aid order, we had collected 
the fees for the service of taking the impression and the 
non-refundable earmolds.  
Step Six: Calculating Break-Even (better late 
than never) and Creating a Superbill
In 2010, five years after unbundling, we calculated the 
cost of doing business and determined our break-even 
hourly rate. Sadly, we wish this step had been completed 
at the beginning of the process. Therefore, our advice to 
anyone considering unbundling, is to start with step six. It 
is not advisable to set a fee schedule until one has estab-
lished what it cost to run the business. Also in 2010, we 
created a new superbill, using proper codes for everything 
related to hearing aid delivery and audiological rehabilita-
tion. Audiologists can use both CPT (current procedural 
terminology) codes and HCPCS (Health Care Current 
Procedure Coding System) codes when establishing a fee 
schedule. Throughout this article we have included some 
of the relevant codes for hearing aid services.
As one works to create a superbill and determine the 
price for hearing aid(s) and services, one must realize that 
the invoice cost for the hearing aid(s) is not the actual 
cost. There are other direct and indirect product costs. All 
audiologists should calculate a break-even analysis for 
their practice and determine how much money it takes 
per hour to simply keep the doors open. Then one can 
establish the fees for services and determine the hearing 
aid prices that will allow the business to prosper. 
Calculating the Cost of Doing 
Business
According to the 2011 Hearing Aid Billing Practices Survey, 
only 43 percent of audiologists surveyed have calculated 

SepOct2011 | Audiology Today
43
Myth Busters: Can You Unbundle and Stay in Business?
break-even analysis to determine what it costs to run 
their practice, thus 57 percent are either arbitrarily choos-
ing rates or using the going rate in the area or some other 
method. With or without a business major, it is fairly sim-
ple to calculate the cost of doing business (Foltner, 2009).
Establish Annual Contact Hours
	
Determine how many hours per week one can see/bill 
patients. Although the practice may operate 40 hours 
per week, one must consider the time that is related to 
direct patient contact. 
	
Calculate the number of weeks per year that one actu-
ally sees patients (factor in holidays, vacation, sick and 
professional leave). 
	
Determine the number of providers in the practice. 
	
Multiply the hours per week by weeks per year by the 
number of providers (See Figure 5). 
Calculate the Operating Costs for the Practice
Ideally this would be broken down into several different 
expense categories, including: 
 
personnel (salary/benefits), 
 
clinic expenses (rent, utilities, phone, advertising, etc.) 
 
cost of goods (all things you buy for resale).  
Determine the Break-Even Hourly Rate
 
Subtract the cost of goods from total annual clinic 
expenses, and divide the remaining amount by the 
‘annual contact hours’ established in step one.
 
This is the break even hourly rate in an unbundled 
model. (See Figure 6). 
Add in Desired Profit 
 
Take annual expenses less cost of goods, add desired 
profit and divide this number by the annual contact 
hours. 
 
This is the hourly rate including the desired profit.  
(See Figure 7). 
In the unbundled model, the cost of goods has been 
excluded from the equation, as it is expected one will 
collect, at a minimum, dollar for dollar on the cost of

products. In most clinics, there will be a markup over the 
invoice cost to cover situations when one cannot collect 
the hourly rate. An example of this is Medicare’s coverage 
of a comprehensive hearing evaluation. While one’s fees 
should reflect the hourly rate, the reimbursement from 
Medicare rarely covers the cost of doing business. 
Unbundling Is Bad for Business
The UNC-HCC has been partially unbundled since 2005. 
Over the past six years, we have continued to tweak our 
billing structure and improve consistency in billing prac-
tices among providers. We have updated our superbill to 
allow the use of proper codes and we have implemented 
a policy that every patient checks out with the superbill 
circled, indicating all services rendered. Our office man-
ager generates an invoice for every single patient to take 
home that lists all the services provided and collects full 
payment the day the service is rendered. If the patient 
is within the 45-day evaluation and adjustment period, 
the invoice details all the services rendered and has a 
zero dollar amount as these services were pre-paid in 
the professional fees at the time of the fitting. We believe 
it’s critical for the patient to see what services have been 
provided each time he or she sees the audiologist. Figure 
8 is an example of one week’s revenue depicting services 
by CPT and HCPCS codes. Though there were days when 
no hearing aids were dispensed, the clinic brought in rev-
enue every single day as a result of the unbundled billing 
model. Thus, we no longer have days where we see fifteen 
patients and collect no money. 
The original myth in question stated that unbundling 
is bad for business. A graph showing revenue generated 
from hearing aids and professional services over a 10-year 
period shows that unbundling has been a very favorable

model for the UNC-HCC clinic (See Figure 9). Our move to 
unbundling has not only grown our patient base by 450 
percent but also increased our revenue over the past ten 
years by 178 percent. The myth is busted! We have been the 
only clinic in our area with this model for the past six years and 
our business is thriving. We have successfully taken on the chal-
lenge of making the impossible happen.
Convinced? What Can You Do 
Tomorrow Morning?
While there will always be some who choose to stay with 
the time-honored, and more traditional way of billing 
hearing care, we hope many of you are encouraged that 
unbundling can serve the audiology professional and the 
patients quite well. As you contemplate whether this is 
the right model for your clinic:  
	
Be confident in the good work you do as an audiologist.
	
Evaluate each service for which you are presently not 
charging and determine if it is truly a pre-paid service.
	
Utilize a superbill with each patient. Circle all appro-
priate services regardless of whether there is a charge 
and send an invoice home detailing the services 
provided.
	
If not presently implementing Academy Task Force rec-
ommendations for the fitting of amplification, strongly 
consider how this can add value to your practice and 
justify charging for services. These practices set you 
apart from the competition, who may not be using 
evidence based practice—your patients will hear the 
difference.
When you are ready to unbundle:
	
Determine the costs to run your practice and use your 
calculated hourly rate to set your fees for service. You 
will set your practice up for success should the day 
come when you can no longer depend on hearing aid 
sales for the bulk of your revenue. 
	
Continue to educate yourselves at AudiologyNOW!, at 
other meetings, and through journals articles. Stay 
current with best practice procedures as well as coding 
and billing. You cannot be successful unless you are 
well-informed and up-to-date on what is happening in 
the field. Yesterday’s solutions may not be adequate 
for tomorrow’s challenges.

It is so easy to get swept up in 
the swift current of technology, 
lose your bearings, and wind up 
floating aimlessly in an ocean  
of uncharted territory. It is time 
to analyze what it takes to fit 
the ever advancing and supremely 
complex hearing instruments and 
accessories. 
A
s a Generation X-er, I have grown up along with 
the advances of digital technology. The clear-
est example of this is my first love, music. The 
first music I listened to were nursery rhymes and Disney 
records on my Strawberry Shortcake record player. For 
a brief time, I even listened to my uncle’s eight-tracks, 
which quickly morphed into wearing out cassette tapes 
on a Sony Walkman. The Walkman eventually gave way 
to a compact disc player. Today, I have close to a terabyte 
of music on an external hard drive, which is constantly 
revolving around my iPod. I taught my mother how to 
program new car stereos, VCRs, DVD players, and most 
recently how to connect her laptop wirelessly to her 
printer. I have shown her how to download music and 
how to text on her cell phone. Technology and I are 
friends for the most part; occasionally we have our dis-
agreements, but soon realize we need each other. 
When the use of digital technology took off in the 
hearing aid industry, I was well-versed and ready, or so I 
thought. The rate of advancements and features avail-
able on today’s technology changes so rapidly, it is nearly 
impossible to keep pace. To say one offers the “latest in 
digital technology” is arguably a false or at the least a 
misleading statement. With new and improved technol-
ogy released from multiple manufacturers several times 
a year, the average practicing audiologist may actually 
be fitting last month’s technology. A pair of hearing aids 
purchased for stock could be out of date before your next 
new patient arrives in your office!
It is so easy to get swept up in the swift current of 
technology, lose your bearings, and wind up floating 
aimlessly in an ocean of uncharted territory. It is time 
to analyze what it takes to fit the ever advancing and 
supremely complex hearing instruments and accessories. 
A Brief History
Digital hearing aids were just beginning to emerge when 
I began my career as an audiologist. Most adjustments 
were still being made by handy little screwdrivers, which 
could also tighten the glasses of my patients. Then, in the 
mid 1990s the “HIPRO” (Hearing Instrument Programmer) 
47
SepOct2011 | Audiology Today

Audiology Today | SepOct2011
48
Limitless Wires in a Wireless World
box was developed. Several proprietary programming 
boxes for specific hearing aid manufacturers were also 
created around this time. The HIPRO allowed audiologists 
to connect and directly program hearing instruments set-
tings. These new hearing aids were considered “digitally 
programmable.” Audiologists were able to change gain in 
measurable quantities. We could also change the cross-
over frequency and threshold kneepoints. The higher the 
technology the more frequency bands to which you had 
access. All of the huge specification binders, which had 
taken up shelf space, were soon placed in storage. By now 
they have surely been tossed in the trash, although I have 
a sneaking suspicion that a few still survive. 
The computerized technology allowed for more ver-
satile instruments and specification documents within 
the software. Digitally programmable soon gave way to 
the first generation purely digital hearing instruments. 
The difference being that digitally programmable aids 
maintained an analog output, whereas the newer digital 
aids actually digitized the sound signal. The digitized 
sound could be “cleaned up and modified” as much as 
the researchers and developers imagination and ingenu-
ity would allow. The first and second generation digital 
hearing instruments are mere skeletons compared 
to the digital processing available in today’s hearing 
instruments.
Setting Standards
According to their Web site, www.himsa.com, HIMSA 
was founded in 1993 to help standardize hearing aid fit-
ting software through one common interface program, 
NOAH. HIMSA, although privately owned, is made up of 
99 members. Member categories include manufactur-
ers of hearing instruments and audiological equipment, 
office automation system suppliers, hearing instrument 
dispensing chains, NOAHlink member companies, and 
ear impression scanner manufacturers. Approximately 90 
percent of members are hearing aid manufacturers. These 
members are responsible to make software that allows 
the dispensing audiologist to use one database of patient 
information that is “easily shared” between different 
fitting modules. Modules include the hearing aid fitting 
software and measurement modules that connect to real 
ear, hearing aid test boxes, and audiometers. 
Although the database is shared, each manufacturer 
requires a different set of wires to connect to their indi-
vidual software. Very few can be used interchangeably. 
Long wires, that tangled themselves behind my back, 
began to pile up in drawers, hang on hooks on the back 
of doors, or even in plastic tackle box organizers. Battery 
pills, behind the ear (BTE) boots, three and four gold strip 
connectors sit amongst used batteries, screw drivers, 
cleaning tools, tube pullers on virtually every dispens-
ing audiologist’s desk. Multiply that by two, three, or four 
manufacturers and you are literally up to your ears in it. 
Even Martha Stewart would have a difficult time organiz-
ing the clutter that comes with dispensing digital devices. 
A few years later, the NOAH Link was developed. This 
device connects via Bluetooth and allows the patient to 
move freely around the office. Presumably so that the 
patient feels less tethered, and depending on office setup, 
real time changes can be made with the patient in sound 
field. The NOAH Link also offered higher speed trans-
mission of data, as the internal workings of advancing 
technology in hearing aids required larger amounts of 
information to pass.
The goal of NOAH is to allow the clinician to col-
lect and store the data from the testing equipment and 
choose virtually whatever manufacturer they wish to 
fit without re-entering data. In theory this interface can 
increase office productivity and allow Audiologists to 
explore different manufacturers and what their products 
have to offer. The most current version, NOAH 4, was beta 
tested and released in early spring 2011. Licenses for the 
product can be purchased and the software downloaded 
from the HIMSA Web site. Technical support, however, 
is not handled by a HIMSA representative, but by one of 
its member’s technical support departments. In short, 
if you have difficulty with HIMSA software, you would 
call either a hearing aid or equipment manufacturer 
and speak to their technical support department. From 
personal experience these are the most underappreciated 
people in our field. They have talked me out of the bell 
tower on more than one occasion. 
The Rate of Change
It used to be that audiologists received annual prod-
uct updates, typically announced around the date of 
I have come to realize as  
a private practice owner 
that “I don’t know what  
I don’t know.”

the American Academy of Audiology’s convention, 
AudiologyNOW! Manufacturer representatives would 
make sure that you received your software upgrade; some 
would even visit your office and help you install it. Fast 
forward to today where nearly every other week our office 
receives a new software upgrade or patch from at least 
one manufacturer. I am sure that I am not the only dis-
pensing audiologist who has ordered a new product from 
a trusted manufacturer, only to realize that I do not have 
the most current software loaded to program it. Most 
downloads are available online, however in some cases 
downloading takes an hour or more; not something you 
want to do with the patient sitting in the waiting room. 
Of course, in a perfect world you have preprogrammed 
and verified the device function days before the patient’s 
appointment. 
Currently, we are seeing the addition of wireless 
programmers adding to our already cluttered desks, and 
taking over our USB ports. We can’t really replace the wall 
of wires, as many of our patients wear hearing aids we fit 
a short time ago that still require those cords and battery 
pills. Fortunately I have a very large desk, so that the mul-
tiple wireless programmers are able to sit neatly in a row. 
I do wish that they could be made in the shape of bobble 
heads, instead of trying to look like monolithic book ends.
The Day the Computer Died
I have come to realize as a private practice owner that “I 
don’t know what I don’t know.” As I mentioned before, 
I like to think that I have a firm grasp on technology, 
computers in particular. I have never had to call the “geek 
squad.” I did have a friend, a computer engineer, set up 
our original office network, as I thought my time was bet-
ter spent on other projects. 
Our office network began simply enough, one all-in-
one fax/printer/copier, one computer for reception, and 
one computer for the back office to handle the hearing aid 
programming, word processing, and accounting software. 
As we grew we added more diagnostic equipment, and 
upgraded software as needed. Fast-forward five years 
and our simple network is not so simple. Our practice has

Limitless Wires in a Wireless World
hearing aids, or NOAH, our growing network turned into 
a nightmare of wires and monitors that could connect to 
the internet, but never to each other.
It seemed with each change of pc-operating systems 
came a host of issues. Move too fast, i.e., getting a 64-bit 
computer, and your old software can’t function. Move too 
slow and the new software won’t work without install-
ing “patches.” Although we knew what devices should be 
networked, software glitches and compatibility issues 
prevented us from fully integrating our office the way 
we first envisioned. In our minds, our office would run 
like “The Jetsons,” while in reality we were closer to “The 
Flintstones.” Our audiologists still hand-write audiograms 
even though our pc-based audiometer is theoretically net-
worked to the pc that holds our NOAH database. It should 
be simple enough, yet full integration and optimal perfor-
mance is always just a patch, or compatibility issue away. 
All this, although frustrating, was somewhat manageable. 
Being a busy practice owner, rarely do you get the 
luxury of free time to investigate the internal struc-
tures of your network. Then the unthinkable happened. 
The main computer, which stored our NOAH database, 
scheduling and accounting software, and every Word 
document we created in the past three years, crashed. 
Fortunately we had backed up most of the information 
on an external hard drive. Still our office was limping by, 
using our back-up laptops to program hearing aids, and 
relying on a very tolerant secretary who kept the sched-
ule going for what seemed like an eternity. For a month, I 
prayed that my patients would come in needing tubing 
changes or receiver replacements, ear mold impressions, 
anything but “fine tuning adjustments.” Stress took on a 
whole new meaning and it became apparent that we had 
to completely unravel and organize the chaos. It seemed 
the more we fixed, the more we found wrong. Several 
well-intentioned, computer-savvy colleagues left our 
office feeling defeated by our computers. We uninstalled 
and reinstalled software repeatedly and spoke to virtu-
ally every technical support department in our industry 
before finally our “new network” was usable once more. 
Conclusion
I continue to have mini-panic attacks every time the 
computer takes a little longer than normal to boot up, 
but I am grateful for the wake-up call I received through 
this experience. I realized that I had taken for granted 
how dependent I had become on technology to help 
my patients. I should have taken a more active role and 
worked with those who are familiar with all of the com-
ponents to help me build my office system. I should not 
have assumed I could fit hearing aids without knowing 
anything about the system and the equipment neces-
sary to program those aids. When our profession relies 
so heavily on applying technology, it is our duty to keep 
as up-to-date and knowledgeable as possible. Inevitably, 
For a month, I prayed that my patients would come

computers will crash and systems will go down. When 
these types of events occur, it is how we handle ourselves 
that truly define our character. There is no question in 
my mind that with improved technology we will continue 
to edge closer to our ultimate goals as a profession. Our 
patients will benefit from the advancements and our 
skills. Computers and programs meant to work together 
will one day access each other and simultaneous sync 
without humans having to touch a button. Maybe the last 
one is still a few years away, but you get where I am going 
with this. 
As a profession, audiologists are undeniably tied to 
technology. This begs the question, how much does the 
dispensing audiologist need to know about technology 
to optimally function? How is this topic supported in 
our audiology and hearing science programs or in our 
continuing education courses? How many of the practic-
ing audiologists took a required computer programming 
course as an undergraduate student and if a course was 
offered or required at that time, would it still be pertinent 
today? Today, there are courses available to highlight 
manufacturer software, however few audiologists take 
courses regarding the systems that interface with the 
software and how to problem-solve when computers dif-
ficulties arise. 
If we truly want technology to work for us, we need 
to start addressing this ever changing knowledge base 
somewhere in our training. Another concern raised by an 
esteemed colleague is the virtual monopoly HIMSA has 
on the market when it comes to integrating databases, 
manufacturers, and patient management software. Is it 
time to start thinking in a different direction? Would it 
be better to have choices in this matter, or do we take the 
99 consortium members of HIMSA at their word? Tough 
questions with no easy answers.
Even with my newfound appreciation of technol-
ogy, I will still have moments of wistfulness. A line from 
Wordsworth’s “Daffodils” poem I had memorized in high 
school floats to the front of my memory. “For oft when on 
my couch I lie in vacant or in pensive mood, they flash 
upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude.” I 
open my desk drawer and look longingly towards my 
trusted screwdriver and think of simpler days.

Evaluating Speech  
Perception Performance
peech perception testing is considered a 
critical part of audiological evaluations. 
Speech perception performance is used 
to assess candidacy for and benefit from 
hearing aids, FM systems, and cochlear 
implants, to identify auditory processing disorders, to 
determine the need for speech, language, and functional 
listening therapy, and to monitor improvement in perfor-
mance over time for children and adults. 
Variability in performance for patients with hearing 
loss is the result of multiple factors. Residual hearing 
is a significant factor in determining access to audi-
tion. Generally, the more residual hearing, the better 
speech perception skills will be. Age at which a person 
is fit with appropriate technology can be a significant 
factor in speech perception performance. Connor et al 
(2006), Sharma et al (2005), Nicholas and Geers (2007), and 
others have demonstrated that earlier cochlear implan-
tation results in improved speech perception. Auditory 
based therapy is known to be a factor in auditory skills 
development (Geers et al, 2002; Nicholas and Geers, 2006). 
Patients whose hearing loss is caused by auditory neu-
ropathy spectrum disorder frequently have poorer speech 
perception than patients with hearing loss from other 
etiologies. (Hayes and Sininger, 2008) A variety of develop-
mental issues can also cause speech perception skills to 
be delayed.
There are no consistent clinical guidelines for speech 
perception testing or for reporting speech perception per-
formance. Katz et al (2009) reports that many audiologists 
label word recognition scores as excellent, good, fair, or 
poor but there is little agreement about the score bound-
aries for these designations. Martin and Clarke (2008) 
suggest the following guidelines: 
By Jane R. Madell, Emily J. Klemp, Reva Batheja, and Ronald Hoffman
While studies often  
report speech perception 
performance, there is  
no general agreement 
regarding choice of test 
material, sound intensity 
levels at which to test,  
nor how to interpret  
test results.

While studies often report speech perception perfor-
mance, there is no general agreement regarding choice of 
test material, sound intensity levels at which to test, nor 
how to interpret test results. Accordingly, there are no 
standards to determine if an individual is performing well.
Without standards, clinicians are left to make indi-
vidual decisions about how a patient is performing and 
whether he or she is a cochlear implant candidate or 
whether changes should be made in hearing aid fitting, 
cochlear implant programming parameters, auditory 
therapy, or educational placement. 
Survey
A survey (see appendix a) was conducted to assess the 
qualifiers used to describe speech perception perfor-
mance (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor); the levels at which 
speech perception was tested and the types of noise used 
when testing speech in noise. Responders were asked 
whether qualifiers should differ when describing perfor-
mance of individuals with normal hearing and those with 
hearing loss. The survey was conducted using web based 
Survey Monkey sent to cochlear implant audiologists in 
the United States and a paper survey distributed to pedi-
atric audiologists at a Pediatric Audiology conference. It is 
estimated that 300 audiologists had access to this survey. 
One hundred forty seven people responded (49 percent).
Results
Speech Perception Qualifiers 
Figure 1 shows the percentage word score associated 
with each qualifier. One hundred twenty two (83 per-
cent) respondents reported that excellent scores were 
between 90 and 100 percent. The range was between 
70 and 100 percent. Eighty-eight of the respondents (60 
percent) considered “good” to be 80–89 percent. The range 
was between 40 and 89 percent. Thirty-two respondents 
(22 percent) considered 70–80 percent as “fair,” and 38 
respondents (26 percent) categorized 60–79 percent as 
“fair.” The range for “fair” was 20 to 80 percent. Thirty-four 
respondents (23 percent) reported “poor” as less than 70 
percent, and 40 respondents (27 percent) reported less 
than 60 percent as poor. The range was for poor was <20 
to < 75 percent. 
Test Levels Used to Evaluate Speech 
Perception
Forty-eight percent of audiologists responded that they 
measure speech perception at 50 dBHL and 38 percent 
responded that they test at 35 dB HL with the range from 
25-60 dB HL (see Figure 2).
Types of Noise Used
Forty-eight percent of responders report that they use 
speech noise, 41 percent used four-talker babble, 10 per-
cent use 12 talker babble and one percent reported “other” 
(see Figure 3). 
Qualifiers Used to Describe Performance of 
Normal Hearing and Hearing Impaired People
Eighty-three percent of recipients reported that the same 
qualifiers were appropriate in describing performance for 
normal hearing and hearing impaired people. Seventeen 
percent disagreed. 
Discussion
The results of this survey highlight a troubling and per-
vasive problem. There is no uniformity of agreement on 
methods of evaluating speech perception and on the defi-
nition of commonly used qualifiers. As a result, a patient 
with a score of 40 percent would be described as “good” 
by some audiologists and “poor” by others. The audiolo-
gist who considered the score “good” would likely not feel 
the need to modify hearing aid settings, cochlear implant 
map settings, suggest changes in technology such as 
considering a cochlear implant, or to refer the person 
for additional therapy. Audiologists who consider the 
score “poor” would likely seek the reason for the “poor” 
performance and try to modify the conditions affecting 
performance. The audiologist who considers 40 percent 
good would be satisfied. It would be useful to develop 
more uniformity in describing performance, and in  
test protocols. 
Recommended Qualifiers
We recommend that the following qualifiers be used to 
describe speech perception performance.
Excellent 	
90–100 percent
Good 		
80–89 percent 
Fair	 	
70–79 percent
Poor	 	
<70 percent

test results. More significantly, accepted standards should 
encourage audiologists and other clinicians working with 
people with hearing loss to look closely at performance 
and to try and determine if modification of performance 
is possible. Fabry et al (2009) suggested a test protocol for 
assessing performance in adult cochlear implant patients. 
This protocol might be considered as a way of developing 
a more uniform test protocol for adults. No such sug-
gested protocol is, as of yet, available for testing children. 
Recommended Test Conditions
It would be useful to have uniform standards for testing 
speech perception. To determine how a person is per-
forming in everyday situations, it would be useful to test 
at normal conversational levels, at soft conversational 
levels, and in competing noise. We are recommending  
the testing be conducted at following levels
Normal conversational level 	
50 dBHL
Soft conversational level	
35 dBHL
Normal conversational level 	
50 dB+5 SNR 
with competing noise 	 	
We suggest 4-talker babble, as the noise source that 
is most like the noise typically interfering with listening 
and should be used.

An Open Letter to Dennis: 
We Can Do More to 		 	
   Educate Our Patients 
About Falls Risk

In this country, more money is spent  
on health care in the last few weeks and 
days of one’s life than during an entire 
lifetime. Often this results from falls, 
many of which might have been 
prevented. Physicians alone cannot be 
expected to do it all. As audiologists 
who treat at-risk seniors, we too need 
to take a patient-centered approach and 
act as advocates for falls prevention. 
I got your message and was 
so sorry to hear that your dad 
passed away yesterday after 
a recent fall. Lately, I have been hearing a lot of similar 
stories from colleagues, family, friends, and patients. This 
caused me to do some research on the topic of falls risk. 
I discovered that each year in the United States, nearly 
20,000 elderly persons die as a result of falls (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2011a). Of course we 
know that many falls go unreported and more than a 
third of the people 65 years of age and older will fall this 
year, and the prevalence increases with age (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2011a). As you recall, my 
dad was one of those statistics a couple years ago. He had 
fallen several times before, but the last one finally took 
his life too. He was only one month shy of 95 and lived 
alone. Dad was in reasonably good health, aside from a 
severe hearing loss for which he refused to use hearing 
aids, despite the fact that my wife, son, and I provided 
him with the best devices on the market on several occa-
sions. His falls history included a broken leg when he fell 
on his front porch a few years earlier. For years, we tried 
to get dad to use the ambulatory devices (e.g., canes and 
walkers) we bought for him, but his excuse was always 
the same—he did not need them and would not use them

because they made him look old! He had driven his car 
right up until his last fall—very scary! But he, like so 
many seniors, refused to give up that hallmark of freedom 
and independence. My dad lasted about one week in the 
hospital after his last fall, during which time a parade of 
physicians and physical, speech, and occupational thera-
pists among others ran every test imaginable on him. He 
was in a coma, and all these specialists were able to get 
about as much response from him as they could have 
from the chair in his hospital room! All that finally came 
to a halt when I told them they could keep testing, prob-
ing, and billing him, but only if they could assure me that 
he would someday get up and walk out of the hospital and 
have a good quality of life. Of course they could not do 
that and seemed embarrassed for their efforts. 
Unfortunately, in this country, more money is spent 
on health care in the last few weeks and days of one’s life 
than during an entire lifetime (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2011b). Often this results from falls, many 
of which might have been prevented. This is an anthem 
that I hear families voice almost daily. I believe that all 
those professionals could have done so much more for 
my dad if they had simply counseled him enthusiastically 
and forcefully years earlier about falls prevention and 
ways to avoid checking out of this world in the fashion 
that he did and that so many other seniors will do. On 
the other hand, I cannot lay all the blame on physicians, 
because I know that our entire family enthusiastically 
and forcefully counseled dad over the years, as you did 
your father. We continually asked him to use his walker, 
and brought his physician into the discussion. He either 
forgot or made conscious decisions to ignore that advice, 
depending on when and where he was. The fact is that 
our counseling is ineffective much of the time when we 
have patients who are rightfully allowed some degree of 
autonomy. All of this was not news to our family since my 
wife’s grandmother endured multiple falls, broken bones, 
and convalescent center stays until she too took a final 
fall that proved to be her demise.
In falls prevention, as with hearing problems and 
hearing aids, we audiologists know that many seniors 
will fail to take steps to deal with their balance problems 
until their family physicians finally provide concrete 
recommendations and guidance about falls prevention.

We Can Do More to Educate Our Patients About Falls Risk
Physicians have enormous power here, much more than 
families and loved ones who can nag for years to get the 
individual to seek help or comply with recommendations. 
Unfortunately, physicians have less and less power when 
patients have to take steps to pay for and follow their rec-
ommendations. I realize that physicians alone cannot be 
expected to do it all. The phrase “It takes a village” really 
applies in reducing falls risk. As audiologists who treat 
these often “hard-headed,” at-risk seniors, we too need 
to take a patient-centered approach and act as advocates 
for falls prevention. We need to remind our physician col-
leagues who treat the elderly that they should recognize 
and exercise their power to influence older persons’ lives 
sooner. If so, then many years of frustration with inad-
equate communication skills and potentially fatal falls 
could be avoided or delayed, and a better quality of life 
could be maintained.
In over 35 years of working with patients, I have 
witnessed an increasing number of them fall, break a hip, 
and end up in a convalescent hospital for the rest of their 
lives. This seems to happen more and more frequently—
or maybe it is because I am just getting older and am more 
sensitive to this issue. The thing that my dad dreaded 
most was ever having to be moved to a nursing home; 
his fall took his life, and he never had to experience that 
fate, but many seniors find themselves in unfamiliar and 
undesirable places as a result of their falls, especially if 
they have no family that can or will take care of them 
in their homes. Even elderly persons living in nursing 
homes where full-time care is available are not exempt 
from falls. Annually, about half of the nation’s 1.7 million 
nursing home residents will fall at least once, and one out 
of 10 of these falls will end in serious injury. Dad’s death 
happened at a time when Carole Johnson, Craig Newman, 
Victoria Williams, and I were preparing an article on the 
topic of falls risk. The article has since been published in 
the Journal of Family Practice (Johnson et al, 2009). We wrote 
the article for a medical journal to help remind physicians 
about the need for them to screen for hearing loss and 
falls risk in their elderly patients. Along with other infor-
mation on the topic, the article provided physicians with 
a convenient checklist of items that they should cover 
in their visits with the elderly and their families. The 
need to assess patients’ hearing was at the top of the list, 
because if patients cannot hear what physicians are say-
ing, then questions and information covered in the rest 
of the visit may be rendered useless. Physicians should 
be sure that their elderly patients have their hearing aids 
on and working, and consider having a PockeTalker or 
similar device available in their offices for those who do 
not use but need amplification. Similar checklists and 
Web sites are provided here for audiologists to use with 
their patients (see Appendix A) and other stakeholders (see 
Appendices B and C) to remind them of the important roles 
they need to play in this area as well.
Just after completing the Journal of Family Practice article, 
Carole Johnson’s father also began suffering from a 
series of falls that have ultimately forced him to leave his 
comfortable home of over 40 years and take occupancy in 
an assisted-living facility where he can easily migrate to 
more continuous care and convalescence as they become 
necessary. This same scenario played out with Carole’s 
aunt who recently passed away in a similar manner. 
Dennis, these stories are not unique to us; it is shock-
ing how many people have their own similar experiences 
to share. I was relaying the story of your father’s fall and 
passing to one of my patients and his wife this morning, 
and they both nodded and smiled. Their eyes welled up 
with tears as they informed me that both of their fathers 
had passed away just last month as a result of falls they 
suffered, even though they had been in reasonably good 
health. More and more, we find that social discussions 
with family and friends turn to some tragedy or another 
relating to an elderly person falling. The problem is 
All audiologists should check to see that questions 
about falls are included in their case history forms  
and that they include discussions about fall risk in 
their counseling with patients.

One-third of all seniors fall every year. The following  
are things you can do to prevent falls.
HEARING: Get your hearing checked regularly!
	
If you use hearing aids, wear them and have them 
cleaned and checked regularly
	
Consider use of hearing aids with t-coils and looping 
your home, or hearing aid technologies that provide 
connectivity to telephones, televisions, and other 
devices via Bluetooth or cimilar circuitry
VISION: Get your vision checked regularly!
	
If you need glasses, wear them regularly!
	
Ensure adequate lighting when walking, both inside 
and outside of the home. If you go out and will be 
returning after dark, be sure to leave a light on. Do not 
try to save on electricity by not using good lighting. 
Remember, the costs of injuries due to falls from inad-
equate lighting far outweigh the savings on electricity 
that might be had from not using lights! Carry a small 
flashlight or keychain light so you can see to unlock 
doors.
BONES: Keep your bones strong! 
	
Have your bone density monitored
	
Take calcium supplements if your physician  
recommends them
	
Exercise regularly
	
Avoid getting up too quickly to answer the door or  
telephone, especially after sitting for long periods 
when leg muscles can go to sleep or cramp
HAZARDS: Safeguard your home!
	
Remove throw rugs, clutter, and other obstacles from 
your floors
	
Ensure adequate lighting both inside and outside, 
especially on porches and walkways
	
Install handles and railings, especially in bathrooms 
and on porches
	
Be sure to check for pets or children under foot
	
Avoid wet spots both inside and outside, especially 
rain and ice
	
Make sure to wear shoes with a sturdy, flat soles that 
make good contact with floors and other surfaces; 
avoid use of slippers and flip-flops
	
Always use a walker or wheelchair if appropriate; 
canes may help, but be aware that they mainly only 
prevent falls in one direction—walkers are superior
	
Get and use a First Alert or similar system for use  
in emergencies
	
Make sure your neighbors, physicians, and audiolo-
gists have a list of family or other contact persons in 
case of emergencies
MEDICATIONS: Ask your physician or pharmacist 
about drugs causing dizziness!
	
Know which of your medications (singularly or in com-
bination) cause dizziness or vertigo, ringing in the ears 
(tinnitus), hearing loss, and/or cognitive impairment
	
Investigate alternative medications with your health-
care professional(s)
	
Avoid using alcohol with medications
	
Keep an updated list of your medications with you 
	
Do not self-medicate 
SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES: Stay active!
	
Join an exercise or swim class

ubiquitous. You and I have been seeing patients and con-
ducting research on elderly persons for many years now.  
I am always taken aback to realize that we are now them! 
Although our minds lead us to believe that we are still as 
young and vibrant as ever, we are now over 60! Like it or 
not, this puts us in the elderly category in spite of catchy 
phrases like “the 60s are the new 40s” or “we are only as 
young as we feel.” In case our hips, knees, backs, skin, and 
hair fail to remind us, one look in the mirror is an instant 
wake-up call that we too need to be careful. While I like to 
think that I am as capable as ever and am actively pursu-
ing my P90X workouts, I must admit to having noticed 
some unsteadiness when I jump on and off of my tractor 
on Saturdays. I have even fallen off a ladder in the past 
couple of years. I have a few close friends that have fallen 
off the roofs of their houses recently; these once vital, 
accomplished athletes, while still young in their minds, 
are now well over 60 and need to be reminded about the 
risks of falling by their health-care providers (i.e., physi-
cians and audiologists)!
As audiologists, we can and need to play a greater role 
in helping our patients, friends, and families be more 
aware of and prepared for falls risk. It seems that our 
elderly female patients are even more likely to sustain 
falls than males. Whether we choose to practice ves-
tibular testing and/or rehabilitation like some of our 
colleagues who excel in that area (e.g., Jacobson, Kileny, 
Shepard, Worthington, Gans, Akins, and others), we at 
least need to know when to make referrals to them. We 
especially need to keep an eye on our elderly patients 
who are frail and live alone. In addition to their primary 
care physicians, we audiologists might be the only ones 
who see these patients on a consistent basis. How many 
patients have we seen transition in a very short time 
from being able-bodied, active seniors enjoying their 
retirement to stooped-over, fragile individuals who are 
more and more unsteady with each and every visit to our 
offices? The checklists and Web sites in Appendix A can 
be used by audiologists to help them with this process. 
All audiologists should check to see that questions 
about falls are included in their case history forms and 
that they include discussions about falls risk in their 
counseling with patients. However, because case histories 
may only be updated every few years, we should pay more 
attention to the general well-being of our patients as they 
come in for hearing aid repairs, batteries, or checkups. 
We audiologists need to be observant and have preven-
tion discussions with our once-bouncy and energetic 
patients who now shuffle their feet and touch the walls of 
the hallway on the way to our exam rooms and attempt 
	
Walk every day
	
Discuss any peripheral neuropathies (e.g., numbness 
and tingling in feet, legs, or arms) with your physician 
and audiologist 
	
Maintain a good sense of humor, be with other people, 
laugh a lot, and have fun
	
Take extra care driving, avoid driving at night or in 
inclement weather, and know when it is time to pass 
over the keys and give up driving
Be sure to contact your primary care physician if 
you have any sudden onset of dizziness, unsteadi-
ness, or lack of mobility.
If you should have an accident, be sure to report it 
and any injuries immediately to your family, your 
physician, and your audiologist.
Do not get in the habit of falling and not telling 
anyone!

compensation via increased proprioceptive input. We and 
our office personnel should be alert for sudden changes 
in our patients’ personal grooming, weight, and ability 
to get around that might signify that they are becoming 
unable to manage their own lives. For example, if once 
punctual patients fail to show up for appointments, we 
should call them or family members to make sure that 
they are okay because many seniors who live alone fall 
at home, cannot get up, and may go for days before being 
discovered. It is important for our offices to maintain a 
list of names and telephone numbers of family members 
who can be contacted in these situations. We should also 
encourage families to obtain First Alert or similar devices 
for their elderly loved ones. We had just purchased a First 
Alert contract for my dad the day he fell, but we were too 
late, and he never got a chance to use it. Families should 
be advised that they need to get these devices and have 
elderly loved ones begin using them well ahead of an 
emergency. We all remember seeing and joking about the 
elderly lady in the television ad a few years ago where 
she was seen shrieking, “Help! I’ve fallen and can’t get 
up.” Although the ad was somewhat humorous, it did 
make the point and seems to be more on target with 
every passing year. Carole Johnson recently related to me 
how her aunt had fallen and failed to answer the phone 
for a few days until it was discovered that she had fallen 
and could not reach the phone. This scenario might be 
avoided with the First Alert type systems that I see more 
and more patients using. These devices allow the elderly 
to maintain some degree of independence while prov-
ing assurance to family members. Routine checking for 
changes in vision, loss of weight and/or bone density, 
decrease in physical activity, and side effects of medica-
tions can often uncover potential problems that could 
lead to falls, as well as tinnitus and hearing loss.
When I see that there might be a problem in this 
area, I find that it is helpful to introduce the topic of falls 
risk by giving patients and their families the handout in 
Appendix A and telling them about my dad and others 
who have succumbed to untimely accidents. Such mis-
haps could often easily be prevented by use of ambulatory 
assistive devices like walkers; making sure that shoe

soles are sturdy and that they make firm and level con-
tact with surfaces; removal of throw rugs, loose carpeting, 
and clutter in the home; assuring adequate lighting; 
checking that pets and toddlers are not underfoot; taking 
special care on wet, icy, or slippery surfaces; making sure 
that eyeglasses and hearing aids are on and functioning 
properly; and having portable telephones and television 
remote controls located within arm’s reach of the favorite 
viewing chairs. One of the take-home messages that I 
received from the recent AudiologyNOW! was how impor-
tant it is for audiologists to counsel patients about loops 
and the use of t-coils in their hearing aids. In this case, 
looping the living areas of elderly persons might keep 
them from having to get up and move around quickly, 
particularly after sitting for long periods, to adjust televi-
sions or answer phones, which is exactly how my dad fell. 
Many of these suggestions are simple, common sense 
things that everyone already knows to do, but attend-
ing to any one of them might prevent a catastrophic fall. 
Adding these items to audiologists’ counseling of elderly 
(or even younger when appropriate) patients and their 
families and warning about the importance of warding 
off osteoporosis and neuropathy, keeping active, and 
investigating how medications (especially if taken along 
with alcohol) may contribute to falls does not require 
much additional time during an office visit but can show 
them that you care about all aspects of the patients’ 
well-being. It also offers an opportunity for audiologists 
to make the inner ear connections between the hearing 
and balance mechanisms clear to patients and why it is 
sometimes necessary to evaluate both vestibular and 
auditory systems and to consider how vision and proprio-
ceptive sensory integration may contribute to both. These 
aspects are clearly within the audiology scope of practice 
and should not be left to our primary care physician col-
leagues alone. 
If audiologists will take the time to include a discus-
sion of falls risk for their patients when appropriate, 
then perhaps they may be able to help families avoid 
the consequences of untimely accidents like the ones 
we have all had to deal with in our own families. We 
audiologists are all in a unique position to offer more 
than hearing tests and hearing aids to our patients—we 
can and need to do more. We can also extend our influ-
ence into the community by speaking on the need for 
decreasing falls risk when addressing civic organizations 
or providing in-services to staff at long-term residential 
care facilities who may wish to establish falls prevention 
programs. Appendix C is an example of an outline for a

talk to encourage administrators and staff to set up a falls 
prevention program. 
Audiologists, physicians, care givers, and families need 
to give elderly persons their due respect and acknowledge 
their desires to maintain their independence. We need 
to remember that just because people reach a certain 
age and become more frail, it does not necessarily mean 
that they all are incompetent, demented, or incapable of 
making proper decisions. Dennis, I am reminded of how 
you told me that your dad had looked a bit demented with 
blueberry jelly on his face when the paramedics arrived 
at his house after one of his earlier falls but that his 
appearance was due to his Parkinson’s disease interfer-
ing with his grooming habits rather than incompetence 
as he was quite capable of interacting and reasoning with 
and assuring them that he was okay. Similarly, Carole 
Johnson relayed how her dad could not sleep recently and 
allowed a piece of toast to burn and set off alarms while 
he was in the shower at 5:00 am, which prompted a visit 
from the assisted-living facility staff. He told Carole how 
strange it must have looked to see an old man standing 
naked with the kitchen on fire as the firemen broke down 
his door. Unfortunately, he lost his toaster oven and was 
put on close watch after the incident, but that he was able 
to acknowledge the humor in the situation and was able 
to discuss and joke about the event with Carole showed 
that he was neither senile nor incompetent. These stories 
remind us that age, how someone looks, and the situ-
ation should cause us to respect and not prejudge and 
jump to conclusions about a person’s cognitive status. 
Nevertheless, these events can be a precursor of things 
to come. Your dad fell and passed away only a few days 
after his incident with the paramedics, and Carole just 
informed me that her dad hit a bicyclist while driving his 
car today. Although it was a relatively minor accident, not 
his fault, and no one was hurt, Carole’s dad freely admit-
ted that his driving days were over. I saw my dad dent 
his car and knock off his rearview mirrors on people’s 
mailboxes on multiple occasions yet deny that he had 
problems driving and refused to give up the keys. Take 
a look at your elderly patients’ cars and observe them 
pulling in and out of the parking lot, and you will quickly 
notice which ones are likely to be at risk for falls and 
other issues. 
In reality, in spite of our efforts it will often be difficult 
to get all patients to follow our recommendations. We all 
know of examples like the couple who was in their 80s, 
lived alone, had no help in the house, and were clueless 
about what to do, even about how to get a housecleaner. 
During an extensive counseling session in which it was 
stressed how important it was for them to plan for help 
and for emergencies, it was determined that their nearest 
family member was a daughter about 90 minutes away, 
who was busy and rarely visited. Although the schedule 
was jammed as a result of a lengthy counseling session, 
they were given a simple “to do” list for them to take 
home, which hopefully had a small impact on a huge and 
growing problem for them. Several important questions 
arise as busy clinicians begin addressing issues of falls 
risk with their patients. How much time can we exert 
on this type of counseling? Where do we draw the line 
on helping these people with whom we have had long-
standing relationships and who are not being fully served 
by their family and physicians? How effective can we be 
in counseling patients when they do not or cannot see 
how serious the topic is? I recall you telling me how your 
father insisted on keeping his old wobbly swivel rocker 
that threatened to toss him through the window every 
Edward W. Van Vliet 1918–2011
Edward Van Vliet died in February 2011 as a result of complications 
resulting from a fall in his home. A carpenter by trade, he was very 
physically active throughout his life in work and play. He enjoyed 
hiking and appreciated nature, and especially loved fishing. 
Parkinson’s disease progressed over the last 10 years of his life, 
limiting his mobility and balance, but not his sense of humor or 
dignity. In spite of the Parkinson’s, he did what he could with 
patience and a smile.

time he sat in it and how he steadfastly refused the power 
lift chair you bought for him. We audiologists need to 
include anything that helps us counsel this stubborn, 
independent, and proud population. Things will likely get 
worse as Medicare is gutted and patients have to start 
paying more and more for treatment. We must remember 
that even if we are effective with our counseling, patients 
may still look at the cost and refuse to follow the plan.
Again, Dennis, I am very sorry to hear about your 
loss. Unfortunately, we will probably hear about similar 
accidents from a lot more of our friends, both inside and 
outside of the audiology community over the com-
ing years, especially as we baby boomers embrace the 
challenges of joining that “chronologically gifted” group 
known as the elderly. Hopefully, this article can serve as 
a heartfelt wake-up call for clinicians that will encourage 
them to help look after the global needs of their patients. 
At the risk of information overload, the attached coun-
seling checklists include critical safety and convenience 
factors that should be valuable to assure that patients are 
doing all that can be done to ensure their safety, including 
having a support network. If audiologists use these check-
lists as handouts for their patients, then they can at least 
highlight the critical points in the office and patients can 
go over the rest (hopefully with families) at home at their 
own convenience. If we are lucky and take our own advice, 
then maybe the best we can hope for is that we and our 
immediate loved ones are not the next to fall.
Sincerely, 
Jeff

As part of the Foundation’s efforts to advance audiology research, Audiology Today will  
periodically feature an interview with a past recipient of Foundation research funding.  
This segment features Tiffany Johnson, PhD, a 2007 recipient of a New Investigator Award.
Fabry: When the Foundation was reorganized in 2002, I 
was privileged to serve as chair of the inaugural board, 
which recommitted its role as the philanthropic arm of 
the Academy, with the new mission “to support pro-
grams of excellence in research, education, and public 
awareness.” 
To that end, one of the new board’s first initiatives was 
to establish a primary goal to support the Academy’s 
Research Awards program, providing support in the 
form of New Investigator, Student Investigator, and 
Summer Fellowship awards that ranged from $2,500-
$10,000. Assuming financial stewardship for this program 
was a first step in fulfilling its renewed philanthropic 
responsibilities.
Danielson: Since that time, the Foundation’s support 
of audiology research has been one of its most suc-
cessful programs. Foundation research funding has 
been expanded and now includes funding for the 
Student Research Forum and the James Jerger Awards 
for Excellence in Student Research, in addition to 
partnerships with allied organizations such as the 
National Hearing Conservation Association (NHCA), the 
Association for Research in Otolaryngology (ARO), and the 
American Balance Institute Education Foundation. The 
Foundation has also received support for topic-focused 
research in the areas of pediatrics, noise-induced hearing 
loss, and vestibular issues.
Culver: The Foundation’s Research Grants in Hearing 
and Balance program continues to attract high quality 
applications from hearing scientists across the United 
States. Proposals are reviewed each fall by the Academy’s 
Research Committee, and several innovative projects 
are funded each year. Since 2003, the Foundation has 
provided approximately $350,000 in research funding, 
supported largely by Academy members’ gifts to the 
Annual Fund.
Fabry: It is our pleasure to visit today with Dr. Tiffany 
Johnson, who received a 2007 New Investigator Award in 
the amount of $10,000 for her work, “Characterizing the 
Effect of Stimulation Parameters on DPOAEs Recorded 
in Normal and Impaired Ears.” Thank you so much, Dr. 
Johnson, for taking the time out of your schedule to speak 
with us. Can you discuss a little bit about the factors that 
went into your choice of research topic?
Johnson: It was an extension of a line of research that I 
became involved with during my postdoctoral training at 
Boys Town National Research Hospital. During my time 
at Boys Town, we completed several studies that involved 
manipulations to the stimuli that are used to record dis-
tortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). DPOAEs 
have been used for a variety of purposes with normal 
hearing persons and those with hearing loss. As I’m sure 
you’re aware, DPOAEs are evoked with pairs of primary 
tones of different frequencies, f1 and f2 (f2 > f1), and with 
levels, L1 and L2, that may be equal or different. At Boys 
Town, we were using a technique that my colleague, Steve 
Neely, had developed that allowed us to very rapidly 
present many different stimulus-level combinations in 
an efficient manner. We used that technique to explore

Audiology Today | SepOct2011

AAA Foundation Research Spotlight: Tiffany Johnson, PhD
a number of questions, including which stimulus-level 
combinations produce the biggest response in normal 
hearing subjects. 
Fabry: So the technique provided larger DPOAE 
magnitudes?
Johnson: Over the course of a couple different studies, 
we developed new stimulus parameters that we believed 
would produce larger responses in normal-hearing sub-
jects than other stimulus approaches that are in use. We 
were excited by this and thought that a logical next step 
would be to see if these new parameters resulted in more 
accurate identification of hearing loss. We completed 
a study asking that question and found that these new 
stimuli did not improve the accuracy with which DPOAEs 
identify hearing loss compared to other protocols that are 
used clinically. We were surprised by this result, but in 
discussing that outcome with colleagues at conferences, 
we began to think that maybe we were thinking about the 
stimulus issue the wrong way. Perhaps it would be useful 
to look at what happened in the impaired ear as we manip-
ulate stimulus parameters. This idea was the basis of the 
project that I submitted to the Foundation for funding.
Fabry: Understood. So what did you find?
Johnson: Well, as most research studies do, this one led 
us to more questions than answers. The project had two 
aims: the first aim was to identify the stimulus param-
eters that produce more robust responses in ears with 
mild-to-moderate hearing loss. The second aim was to 
identify stimuli that would more effectively separate 
responses for subjects with normal hearing from subjects 
with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. 
Fabry: So the first aim is really the opposite of the goal 
with newborn hearing screening, where the objective is 
to develop stimuli that effectively segment normal and 
mildly impaired ears with high sensitivity and specificity. 
Johnson: Right. But our thought with this aim was to 
explore the parametric space to see if we could identify 
stimuli that would allow us to record a response in an ear 
with preexisting hearing loss that might not produce oto-
acoustic emissions using our standard stimuli. This could 
potentially be useful for monitoring applications (e.g., 
ototoxicity monitoring). There’s also been some work in 
Germany (Muller and Janssen, 2004) using DPOAE input/
output functions to set hearing aid parameters, and so 
there might be hearing aid fitting applications where you 
want to record a DPOAE in an ear with hearing loss. 
Fabry: Potentially providing an “objective” tool for use 
with hearing aid evaluation and fitting.
Johnson: Possibly, yes. The second aim was more of the 
traditional application of emissions, which is to sepa-
rate normal ears from those with hearing loss. We know 
from a number of studies (Norton et al, 2000; Gorga et 
al, 2005) that if you look at screening performance, we 
miss about half of ears with mild hearing loss (defined as 
audiometric thresholds of 25–40 dB HL). We were inter-
ested specifically in improving the accuracy with which 
DPOAEs identify milder amounts of hearing loss. 
Fabry: Which has obvious implications for hearing 
screening purposes if “false negative” responses can be 
reduced. 
Johnson: Yes. So, with those two aims in mind, we 
recruited a group of 28 adults: 14 with normal hearing and 
14 with mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and we recorded 
responses using Dr. Neely’s technique for rapid recording 
of responses for a range of stimulus combinations.
Fabry: That’s a lot of data.
During my time at Boys 
Town, we completed 
several studies that 
involved manipulations 
to the stimuli that are 
used to record distortion 
product otoacoustic 
emissions (DPOAEs).

Johnson: Yes, we ended up with an enormous data set. We 
recorded results at four primary frequencies (f2) and eight 
frequency-ratio (f2/f1) combinations for a huge range of 
stimulus-level (L1, L2) combinations. In looking at the 
results, we feel like we’ve come up with a set of stimulus 
parameters that would result in robust responses in ears 
with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. We’ve reported these 
findings at a couple of meetings, the ASHA Convention 
and the American Auditory Society Annual Meeting, and 
we’re currently preparing a manuscript. We’re excited 
about the stimuli we’ve developed, and we think they will 
allow us to record responses in ears with mild-to-moder-
ate hearing loss, but they need to be validated before we 
explore the clinical utility of these new parameters. 
Fabry: Such as, if you measure a response, have you 
still maintained the sensitivity of the emission to show 
changes after pathology?
Johnson: Yes, that is definitely a study that would need 
to be done. Regarding the second aim, we felt like the 
Foundation grant provided us with some really good pilot 
data but that we needed a much larger sample-size to 
really answer our question. The pilot data suggested that 
we had better separation of responses from normal ears 
and ears with mild-to-moderate hearing loss if we set L2 
at a lower level than is commonly used, in combination 
with an L1 set at a higher level than is typical. We need to 
explore these trends in a larger sample, with some slight 
modifications to our test conditions. The data that we 
collected for the second aim became pilot data for an NIH 
grant that I submitted and was recently awarded.
Fabry: Congratulations!
Johnson: Thanks. So we are going to continue to explore 
that question as part of the NIH grant.

AAA Foundation Research Spotlight: Tiffany Johnson, PhD
Fabry: Excellent. Did the frequency ratio data (f2/f1) inter-
act with the level data you refer to?
Johnson: We explored frequency ratios (f2/f1) from 1.05 to 
1.4 for this study. We found that ears with hearing loss did 
not produce emissions, regardless of how we manipulated 
the level combinations, for extreme ratios (1.05 and 1.4). 
Ratios in the middle (approximately 1.22), that are com-
monly used to record DPOAEs, provided the best results 
for both normal and impaired ears. We want to explore 
the frequency-ratio effect a little more, but we need to 
narrow the f2/f1 range that we are working in.
Fabry: You mentioned that the maximum losses you 
included in your study were 60 dB HL. Are you planning 
to explore the limits of the theoretical maximum for pres-
ence of outer hair cells (OHCs)?
Johnson: Although we were most interested in the mild 
and normal distinction, we did include ears that had 
thresholds up to 60 dB HL. Our rationale was that ears 
with 60 dB of hearing loss should have lost all outer hair 
cell function, and so, for hearing losses greater than 60 dB 
HL, you would not expect the ear to produce an emission. 
In a bigger study, though, you would want to include a 
broader range of hearing loss just to make sure you know 
what’s going to happen in a clinical population. 
Fabry: Sure, and the “brass ring”, at least from my per-
spective, is to extend the utility of emissions to move 
beyond screening applications to work, in combination 
with other electrophysiological measures, to reduce our 
dependence on the behavioral audiogram for first fits in 
children (and adults). I realize that is a ways off, but we 
will look for more research from you in this area, and it is 
impressive that you extended the project funded by the 
Foundation into NIH-funded research. That is really what 
the Foundation’s effort was established to support. 
Johnson: Yes, we felt it worked out very well from our 
perspective. As I mentioned, we need to do some addi-
tional validation in an independent sample, but we’re 
encouraged. 
Danielson: How did receiving the award affect you in your 
education and your career? I mean what has receiving the 
award meant to you?
Johnson: I think the award was quite important. When I 
applied for the award, I was in my first year in a tenure 
track position. It was the perfect type of award to apply 
for when you’re in the early stages of your research and 
academic career. I appreciated the feedback that was 
provided by the Research Committee. The feedback was 
like the summary statement that you get from an NIH 
review panel. It’s always useful to find what the review-
ers liked, and what could have been strengthened. I think 
that this is very helpful at any stage in a research career, 
but particularly when you’re new and doing all this for 
the first time it’s good to have that sort of feedback. So, I 
think the Foundation award was the perfect way to start 
my research career, to help kick-start what was going on 
in the lab.  
Danielson: Actually it’s encouraging to hear that your 
experience provides a template of what we wish to have 
this New Investigator grant provide, so we know that we 
have a committee that has done its job well. They are very 
dedicated and take it very seriously, and we are delighted 
to receive some very, very strong proposals followed 
by quality outcomes like yours to be accredited by the 
Academy Foundation’s financial support. 
Johnson: Well, thank you. I appreciated it.
Fabry: So you’ve recently received the R03 Award from 
NIH, ensuring that you will continue with your DPOAE 
research. Can you fill us in on other developments regard-
ing your role at the University of Kansas?
It was the perfect type of award to apply for  
when you’re in the early stages of your  
research and academic career.

AAA Foundation Research Spotlight: Tiffany Johnson, PhD
Johnson: Beginning in August 2011, I will be switching 
to the Medical Center at the University of Kansas, which 
is an exciting opportunity for me. I’ll have more gradu-
ate teaching than I’ve had on the Lawrence campus. So 
I’ll have even more interaction with our AuD and PhD 
students. I’ll be continuing to teach a hearing disorders 
course and will be moving into teaching a diagnostic audi-
ology course and a pediatric audiology course.
Danielson: Earlier you mentioned Dr. Neely, is there any-
one in particular who has been to this point particularly 
influential to you as a mentor?
Johnson: Yes, I feel like I’ve been very fortunate to have 
had really good mentors at various stages in my career. 
It started when I was at the University of Iowa. I worked 
with Carolyn Brown and Paul Abbas, who were (and 
continue to be) great mentors. In addition to Steve Neely, 
I have to acknowledge Michael Gorga at Boys Town 
National Research Hospital. Michael and Steve provided 
invaluable guidance and support as I transitioned from 
a PhD student to a postdoctoral researcher and into my 
faculty position. All of my mentors have been fabulous 
and so important to me and my career. 
Fabry: You can’t overstate the importance of a good 
mentor, and I always remind people that it doesn’t cost 
anything to let them know what they meant—and mean—
to you. Now that your role has transitioned from “student” 
to “mentor,” what advice to you want to provide for those 
considering a research career in audiology?
Johnson: Well, one thing I tell my current students is that 
there are tons of opportunities out there, and I actually 
think it’s a good time to be an audiologist who’s embark-
ing on a research career. Although the funding landscape 
is difficult, the NIH and the NIDCD are quite interested 
in supporting translational studies where we’re mov-
ing basic science into the patient arena – from bench to 
bedside, as it were. 
Fabry:  Well, thank you again for sharing your story on 
how the Foundation’s New Investigator Grant made an 
impact on your research career in Audiology. We encour-
age other young researchers to consider applying for one 
of the several types of grants available to carry out the 
Foundation’s mission to support Audiology research, edu-
cation, and public awareness.

They Said What  
About Audiology
By Patricia Gaffney
A
fter audiology is mentioned 
in a television show or in 
the news, a flurry of discus-
sion generally ensues in offices, on 
the Academy’s SoundOff listserv, 
and on social media sites such as 
Facebook. Whether the information 
is positive or negative there is always 
a discussion. But, as a community, 
are we using this free publicity as 
an opportunity to increase audiol-
ogy awareness? October is National 
Audiology Awareness Month. One 
of the main goals of this initiative is 
to equate audiologist as the hearing 
and balance health-care professional. 
Harnessing the power of free publicity 
is one approach to meeting that goal. 
Take Advantage of  
Free Publicity
Using online news stories or other 
similar pieces from the press are 
great tools, as it is quick and easy 
to provide a link from that Web site 
to your Web site. One component of 
guerrilla marketing is to use these 
free opportunities to your advantage 
(Levinson et al, 2008). Many news 
sites have sharing mechanisms 
such as a blog, LinkedIn, Twitter, 
or Facebook widget. Cross-posting 
increases the viewing audience, as 
well as, potentially linking your Web 
site to other search results. Not only 
can these widgets be used to post the 
article on your own business site, but 
you can also post directly under the 
article in the comments section. You 
can post information about audiology 
and, if it is local, you can post infor-
mation about your business. One 
tool that is helpful for finding these 
free publicity gems is Google Alerts. 
Google Alerts allows you to search 
for key terms, such as audiology or 
hearing loss, in news articles, blogs, 
and videos as they are published and 
Google will deliver any new findings 
to your e-mail account. Social media 
is another great source for infor-
mation. The Academy often posts 
relevant articles on the Academy’s 
official Facebook and Twitter pages.
Create Your Own Publicity
When there is no mention of audiol-
ogy in the news, then why not make 
your own news. Press releases are 
one resource readily available from 
the Academy. Contact your local 
news organization (Levinson et 
al, 2008) with a pre-written press 
release on various content areas that 
can be modified as needed. Several 
Academy members have done this 
and found that not only is the press 
release published, but their business 
information was published with it. 
It is important to remember small 
newspapers as well as the large well 
known newspapers; smaller newspa-
pers particularly those that appeal to 
your target audience may have more 
space to publish this information 
(Levinson et al, 2008).

Ouch, Negative Press
“Audiology is one of the least stressful 
jobs” (Brienza, 2011). That state-
ment spread like wildfire amongst 
the audiology community around 
the world. Many viewed this online 
article as a negative statement 
against our profession. Positive 
publicity is easy to embrace, nega-
tive publicity is often more difficult 
to manage. Negative publicity can 
lead to a reduction in community 
trust (Ferrell and Hartline, 2008). The 
difference between the reaction of 
positive and negative publicity is 
primarily based around emotions. 
There is often more of an emotional 
response when there is negative 
publicity (InBusiness, Inc, 2010). It is 
important to check emotions at the 
proverbial door and take an assertive 
and proactive approach. 
Can negative press be good? 
Yes. There is data to support that 
even negative press will bring new 
“customers” in the door (Shoemaker, 
2008). People are naturally curious, 
so even if the information is negative, 
the curiosity of the reader may push 
them to investigate further. This is 
particularly true if the reader does 
not know much about the subject 
(Berger et al, 2010). For example, 
when a celebrity goes to jail or rehab, 
certainly a negative situation, search 
result ratings for that celebrity will 
skyrocket. The negative situation 
becomes a positive by increased 
awareness of the product (Berger et 
al, 2010)—essentially just by getting 
the name out there. 
Curiosity will pique the interest 
of some, but to gain the interest of 
more use the tools available to you. 
Most importantly, do not let emo-
tions fuel negative press with more 
negativity. If there is a comment area, 
post truthful, positive comments for 
others to read. Based on the content 
of the article, refer readers to more 
information such as your busi-
ness Web site, a local AuD program, 
the Academy, or the Academy’s 
consumer Web site (www.howsyour-
hearing.org). Another way to handle 
negative publicity is to e-mail the 
author. When e-mailing the author, it 
is important to focus on asking the 
author to consider writing a follow-
up article on a different aspect of 
the situation from the view point of 
the audiologist rather than asking 
to have the article removed. More 
often than not, your request to have 
an article removed will be rejected. 
You may find success by offering 
the author another viewpoint with 
a focus on the interests of the public 
and information about your organi-
zation while keeping the interests 
of the media in mind (Smith, 2005). 
Taking a moment to think about 
what the most proactive approach is 
will yield results in our awareness 
campaign.  
Conclusion
Audiology awareness is a part of the 
American Academy of Audiology’s 
mission statement. Using every 
opportunity, from both positive and 
negative publicity, to promote audiol-
ogy moves the field one step closer to 
our awareness goals. Take a moment 
to visit the Academy’s Web site to 
view all of the marketing materials 
already created for your use in our 
awareness campaign.

A case study
CSI: Audiology— 
You Be the Detective! 
By Paul Pessis
W
elcome back to an ongoing 
article series that chal-
lenges the audiologist to 
identify a differential diagnosis for 
a case study based on a listing and 
explanation of the non-audiology and 
audiology test battery. It is important 
to recognize that a hearing loss or a 
vestibular issue may be a manifes-
tation of a systemic illness. Being 
part of the diagnostic and treatment 
“team” is a crucial role of the audiolo-
gist. Securing the definitive diagnosis 
is not only rewarding for the audiolo-
gist, but it enhances patient hearing 
and balance healthcare.
Case History
A 16-year-old Asian male presents 
with the complaint of a constant 
headache for two months. Pain 
radiated from the right temple to 
the back of the head. His throat was 
slightly sore, but he denies the pres-
ence of a cough. Hearing is reported 
as “okay” without tinnitus or vertigo. 
He has had a persistent unilateral 
history of middle ear effusion (right 
ear). Some drainage was noted from 
the right ear.
Medication History
He has currently been taking 
Levaquin tablets (antibiotic), Floxin 
Otic Solution (eardrop), and Darvocet 
and Fiorinal (pain medications) to 
treat his headache. Additionally, he 
was self-medicating with Motrin, 
Tylenol, and Advil.
Past History
Six weeks earlier, the patient was 
seen by an ENT, and was diagnosed 
with acute otitis media (AOM) in 
the right ear and treated with an 
antibiotic. Three weeks later, the 
fluid remained, so the ENT inserted 
a T-tube (T-Tubes are typically the 
choice when there is a history of 
chronic fluid being that the T-tube 
is less likely to be spontaneously 
extruded). The ENT physician 
instructed the patient to avoid water 
in the right ear and was advised to 
use steam every other day to address 
the pressure he felt in his head.
Physical Exam
His mom was very disturbed by her 
son’s degree of discomfort and his 
need to take so many medications, 
especially ones for pain. She con-
tacted our office because she wanted 
a joint consultation by both ENT and 
audiology as a second opinion. He 
was first seen by ENT, who observed 
that he was in obvious pain from 
the headache. The pain radiated 
from the right temple to the back 
of his head. The T-tube has already 
mostly extruded from the tympanic 
membrane.
The ENT suctioned some middle 
ear fluid through the posterior perfo-
ration. There were no apparent signs 
of being allergic. The ENT attempted 
to examine the nasopharynx, but due 
to a strong gag reflex, this couldn’t be 
completed.
Diagnostic 
Recommendations
	
Audiogram and middle ear 
evaluation
	
CT scan of the head with and 
without contrast
	
CT scan of nose and sinuses
	
MRI of brain with gadolinium
	
Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy 
(FFL) with topical anesthesia, if 
able (Endoscopy)
	
Consult pediatric neurologist 
(regarding the refractory head-
aches) pending results of the 
radiographic studies
	
Advil for pain; discontinue 
narcotics
Audiometric Findings
Audiogram and immittance testing:
	
Audiometry: Normal puretone 
and speech audiometry find-
ings for the left ear. A minimal 
air-bone gap noted in the right ear, 
most likely the result of the prior 
T-Tube resulting in a posterior 
perforation.
	
Tympanometry
––
Left ear—normal

––
Right ear—flat with increased 
volume consistent with a 
perforation
	
Ipsi Reflexes
––
Left ear—present
––
Right ear—CNT 
Radiographic Findings
	
CT sinuses: Nasopharyngeal mass 
was present, eccentric to the right, 
with erosive changes in the sphe-
noid bone/clivus.
	
MRI brain with and without con-
trast: Abnormal mass was present 
with the epicenter in the right 
nasopharynx. The mass extended 
up to the skull base abutting the 
right internal carotid artery at the 
foramen lacerum and crossing to 
the left of midline. The lesion was 
associated with eustachian tube 
obstruction and right middle ear/
mastoid opacification. Probably 
unrelated to the nasopharyngeal 
mass, was a five to six millime-
ter cyst of the pituitary gland. 
Marginal thickening of the right 
maxillary sinus mucosa was noted.
A differential diagnosis is 
predicated upon considering all the 
findings. The key facts include: this 
is a 16-year-old male patient of Asian 
descent, he has a history of right-
sided unilateral middle ear effusion, 
he has a persistent severe headache 
for two months, and has no relief 
from pain medications and other 
medical and non-medical treatments. 
Radiographic studies support the 
presence of a nasopharyngeal mass. 
Possibilities for the diagnosis include:
	
Chronic Otitsis Media
	
Lymphoma
	
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
	
Scarring Secondary to Syphilis 
	
Juvenile Nasopharyngeal 
Angiofibroma (JNA)
So, what do you think? If you 
selected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 
you are correct!
Discussion
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma accounts 
for 85–95 percent of malignancies 
of the nasopharynx. Cancer begins 
when one or more genetic muta-
tions cause normal cells to grow out 
of control and can metastasize to 
other parts of the body. Exactly what 
causes the gene mutations that lead 
to nasopharyngeal carcinoma isn’t 
known. Interestingly, 80–90 percent 
of patients with nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC) have increased anti-
body titers to the Epstein-Barr Virus 
(the virus most commonly associated 
with mononucleosis). Researchers 
report that NPC is more common in 
men, that it more commonly affects 
people in Asia and Northern Africa, 
and, in the United States, Asian 
immigrants have a higher risk of this 
type of cancer than do American-
born Asians. NPC can occur at any 
age, but it is most commonly diag-
nosed in adults between the ages of 
30 and 50. Having a family member 
with NPC increases the risk of the 
disease, although there is contro-
versy as to whether this is due to 
genetic or environmental factors, or a 
combination of both factors. Smoking 
and drinking alcohol increases the 
risk of developing NPC. 
Symptoms
In the early stages of NPC, most 
patients are asymptomatic. 
Eventually, a lump in the neck may 
occur which is caused by a swol-
len lymph node and is most likely 
metastatic disease. There can be 
blood in the saliva and/or in the nose. 
It is very common to have hearing 
loss, frequent ear infections, and 
headaches. 
A Case Study
Figure 1. The majority of nasopharyngeal carcinomas originate in the lateral wall 
of the nasopharynx. NPCs possess an inherent propensity for invasiveness. Cancer 
cells can travel to bone, bone marrow, lungs, and liver. Distant metastases occur 
more commonly in NPC than any other type of head/neck cancer.

NPC is typically an undiffer-
entiated type of squamous cell 
carcinoma. It is believed that chemi-
cals contained in salt-cured foods, 
such as fish and preserved veg-
etables, may increase the risk of NPC. 
Being exposed to these chemicals at 
an early age may increase the risk 
of acquiring NPC. NPC is common in 
southern regions of China, particu-
larly in Guangdong accounting for 18 
percent of all cancers in China. It is 
also common in Taiwan due to the 
South East Asian diet which typi-
cally includes consumption of large 
amounts of salt-cured vegetables, 
fish, and meat. 
Anatomic 
Considerations
The nasopharynx is located directly 
behind the nose at the top of the 
pharynx (throat). This is where the 
nasal passages and the Eustachian 
tubes join the remainder of the upper 
respiratory tract. It is not uncommon 
to have regional metastases. Cancer 
cells from the initial tumor migrate 
to nearby areas, such as lymph nodes 
in the neck, often before the primary 
lesion is discovered. 40 percent spread 
to lymph nodes on both sides of the 
neck and 25 percent invade the base 
of the skull.
Prognosis and Treatment
The one year survival rate is approxi-
mately 85–90 percent. In contrast,  
the five-year survival rate is 30 
percent, even with early detection. 
Better prognosis is associated with 
lower clinical stage of the tumor, 
younger patient age, and female 
gender. The prognosis is worse with 
high-stage tumors, older patients, 
and male gender. 
Primary treatment is radiation 
therapy from the base of the skull  
to the clavicle. Chemotherapy may 
help with metastases, but not the pri-
mary tumor. Cisplatin is the drug of 
choice; however, because it is essen-
tially ineffective in controlling the 
primary tumor, it doesn’t increase 
the survival rate. Surgery adds very 
little benefit.
The patient described in this 
case is in remission. He is healthy 
and well four and a half years post-
diagnosis and treatment. There has 
been no recurrence of the tumor. The 
tympanic membrane perforation per-
sists; however, there is no otorrhea. 
He continues to be followed at four 
month intervals. Tumor surveillance 
will continue his entire life.

S
peech recognition is some-
times difficult because of 
suboptimal speech, rather 
than an inability to hear. A talker 
may hypo-articulate, i.e., mumble, 
or speak too quickly and quietly, 
resulting in words lost in a sentence 
that leaves no clue to what was said. 
When language fails us in this way, 
we become aware of our sensory and 
cognitive limits. There is growing 
evidence that speech is optimized to 
maintain an even rate of information 
transmission, which reduces speech 
recognition difficulty under normal 
communication demands (Jaeger, 
2010). One clinical implication of this 
premise is that speech optimized 
for listeners with normal hearing 
may be suboptimal for listeners with 
hearing loss—too fast, too quiet, or 
under-articulated.
Computational theories of 
language explain that speech 
regulates information flow to keep 
communication efficient (Aylett 
and Turk, 2004). Talkers may adjust 
the duration of their speech by 
hyper- and hypo-articulation (Baker 
and Bradlow, 2009), vowel length 
changes, contractions, and syntactic 
reductions that omit unnecessary 
words (Jaeger, 2010). Piantadosi et 
al (2011) conducted a new analysis 
of large-scale linguistic databases 
from 11 languages, including English, 
German, and Dutch, and found that 
word length increased for words that 
are less predictable from sentence 
context. This suggested that word 
length functions to slow speech 
whenever guessing would be too 
costly. Piantadosi et al (2011) was 
particularly notable because it added 
a significant, new discovery to a line 
of research more than a century old, 
investigating language principles 
using word counts. 
Speech recognition is less 
challenging for longer words, in 
part because word length gives the 
listener extra processing time. The 
uniqueness point of a word is the 
letter or sound that disambiguates 
the identity of a word from similar-
sounding alternatives (Marslen-
Wilson, 1987). For example, “dollh-” 
is uniquely the beginning of 
“dollhouse,” whereas “doll-” could 
be the beginning of many similar 
sounding words, including “dolly,” 
“doll,” “dollar,” and so forth. Many 
short words can only be identified 
with certainty after the talker 
finishes saying them. For example, 
“hear” could be the beginning of 
other words, including “hero” or 
“hearing” (Bard et al, 1988). Listeners 
often recognize longer words before 
the talker finishes saying them, 
which was demonstrated by eye 
tracking (Strauss and Magnuson, 
2008) and time-gating experiments 
(Grosjean, 1980) where listeners 
guessed words from interrupted 
recordings. Although the uniqueness 
point tends to occur later in time 
for longer words than shorter words, 
the later offset of longer words may 
allow more time for recognition and 
memory encoding. This is an added 
advantage for speech recognition 
thresholds (SRTs) measured using 
spondees or disyllabic words, e.g., 
baseball, drawbridge, hot dog, whose 
forms are likely to give listeners 
extra time to recognize items.
Listeners are less likely to mistake 
a long word for other words, in part 
because long words rarely sound 
like other words. Speech recognition 
is more challenging for words with 
many phonological competitors, 
or similar sounding words. For 
example, “cat” can be mistaken for 
many other similar sounding words, 
while “wooden” has few competitors. 
Speech recognition models, including 
the Cohort Model (Marslen-Wilson, 
1987) and the Neighborhood 
Activation Model (Luce and Pisoni, 
1998), propose that phonological 
competitors in the lexicon, i.e., 
long-term memory for words, are 
activated based on their similarity 
to the spoken word, and then 
compete until the listener perceives 
a single word. Shorter words with 
many competitors require more 
time to resolve large competitions, 
resulting in increased reaction times 
and decreased task performance 
compared to longer words with fewer 
competitors. 
Long words also contain more 
redundant sound information 
compared to short words, which

provides extra clues that make 
words more recognizable. For 
example, the word “spaghetti” can 
be identified in English without 
its middle or final syllable, so 
the two last syllables contain 
redundant information (Shannon, 
1948). Although extra information 
may seem inefficient, redundant 
information can be critical to word 
recognition when hearing loss, noise, 
or suboptimal pronunciation obscure 
the speech signal (Warren et al, 
1995). Following from Piantadosi et 
al (2011), redundant clues improve 
the recognition of high information 
words, which benefit less from 
sentence context.
Although long words are easier 
to recognize, the message of 
Piantadosi et al (2011) is not to start 
restructuring your vocabulary to 
include longer words. Rather, their 
observation added evidence that 
information flow is optimized 
according to communication 
demands. The clinical significance 
is that normal speech conveys 
information at a stable but 
suboptimal rate for reduced 
communication channels, e.g., with 
noise or hearing loss, which makes 
recognition of speech in noisy 
environments a particular challenge 
for individuals with hearing loss. In 
line with the view that language is 
optimized, talkers can automatically 
adjust speech quality in response to 
changing communication demands, 
e.g., clear speech, (Helfer, 1997; 
Krause and Braida, 2002). Listeners 
with hearing loss may elicit a more 
optimal speech rate by indicating 
that their communication demands 
are different from the talker by 
reporting, for example, “Please speak 
more clearly, I only heard one word.”
Piantadosi et al (2011) presented 
new evidence that languages are 
optimized systems, because word 
length decreases the speech rate 
for high information words. Longer 
words are associated with more 
robust speech recognition due 
to extra processing time, fewer 
phonological competitors, and more 
redundant information, which 
lessen the need for context. Because 
talkers do not strategically choose 
words on the basis of information 
or length, communication demands 
may automatically guide word 
selection in the same way as certain 
articulation parameters function to 
slow down speech. This framework 
suggests that listeners may indicate 
their communication needs to the 
talker, to elicit changes that optimize 
communication. Talkers adjust their 
speech rate nearly automatically, 
which contrasts with the extra effort 
required to recognize degraded 
speech signals.

It’s More Than Just an Oath: 
Special Olympics World  
Summer Games, Athens 2011
By Kari Morgenstein
T
he Special Olympics athlete 
oath reads as follows: “Let me 
win. But if I cannot win, let 
me be brave in the attempt.” This 
unique oath was implemented at 
the first-ever international Special 
Olympics (SO) games on July 20, 1968, 
in Chicago, IL. Since then, this oath 
has been repeated in various lan-
guages by thousands of athletes from 
hundreds of countries. 
Last year, the Student Academy 
of Audiology (SAA) developed a 
unique relationship with the Special 
Olympics Healthy Hearing (SOHH) 
program. This newly formed alli-
ance aims to encourage audiology 
graduate students to volunteer 
their audiological services (under 
supervision) to the athletes during 
Special Olympics events at the local, 
regional, and state levels. Thanks to 
Samantha Gustafson, 2010–2011 SAA 
Humanitarian Committee chair, and 
her committee members, the SAA is 
well on its way to making this a real-
ity! There are currently 21 local SAA 
chapters, registered with the national 
SAA board of directors that provide 
services to local Special Olympic 
events. The ultimate goal of the SAA 
is to involve audiology students in 
these philanthropic events to edu-
cate them about this underserved 
population and to brand audiology 
on a global level with hearing health 
care through our involvement with 
Special Olympics. 
Recently, I was given a once-in-
a-lifetime opportunity to attend the 
Special Olympics World Summer 
Games in Athens, Greece, as the 
delegate from the SAA Board of 
Directors, thanks to the generosity of 
the American Academy of Audiology 
Foundation and the University of 
Florida. During the games, I had 
the opportunity to volunteer my 
audiological services, interact with 
athletes, and help further develop 
the SAA/Special Olympics Healthy 
Hearing relationship. I, along with a 
group of dedicated, hard-working vol-
unteers, screened over 1,200 athletes, 
and this was only in the first six days 
of competition! We also fit 19 ath-
letes with hearing aids and provided 
a few more athletes with vouchers to 
receive free Phonak hearing aids in 
their specific countries. 
I learned a great deal from my 
attendance at this international 
event, but there were two lessons 
that really struck me. First, I realized 
there are many selfless, determined 
individuals in this world....I saw this 
first hand. The Special Olympics 
Healthy Hearing venue at the World 
Games was run entirely by volun-
teers who donated their time and 
services to a cause bigger than 
themselves. Second, I learned that 
individuals with intellectual disabili-
ties are an extremely underserved 
population in terms of hearing health 
care, no matter the country and 
resources available. We were able to 
help this population a little at the 
World Games, but there is still an 
enormous amount of work to be done. 
If you feel inspired to volunteer for 
Special Olympics or learn more about 
the SAA/Special Olympics Healthy 
Hearing relationship, check out www.
specialolympics.org or e-mail Nicole 
Corbin, 2011-2012 SAA Humanitarian 
Committee chair, at n.corbin4@gmail.
com. 
At the end of the games, a handful 
of athletes walked away with medals, 
but more importantly, athletes with 
previously undiagnosed hearing 
loss were identified by the healthy 
hearing program and provided with 
follow-up care through the SOHH 
program. When the athletes took 
their oath at the Opening Ceremonies 
of the Special Olympics World 
Summer Games 2011, they promised 
to try their hardest and be brave dur-
ing their various competitions. Now 
it’s our turn. The SAA will do our best 
to “be brave in the attempt” to help 
this underserved population and 
work to continue the development of 
the SAA/SOHH relationship.

American Board Of Audiology (ABA)
The Journey to Certifying the First 
Audiologists with Pediatric Audiology 
Specialty Certification
By John A. Coverstone, AuD
A
s the profession of audiology 
grows and matures, there is 
an increasing need for 
special­ists in audiology to become 
highly trained in working with specific 
populations, as well as a continuing 
need for general practitioners. The 
American Board of Audiology (ABA)  
is an organization that develops 
certifications for all audiologists 
desiring to accomplish a higher level 
of training than that required by 
licensure, whether in general practice 
or specialty practice. Following 
AudiologyNOW!® 2011 in April, a 
group of audiologists sat for the 
inaugural examination in pediatric 
audiology. In doing so, the ABA and 
audiology celebrated years of work by 
the Pediatric Audiology Specialty 
Certification (PASC) Task Force, the 
ABA Board of Governors, and subject 
matter experts in the profession.
The reasons for taking this 
examination were as varied as the 
audiologists who elected to sit for 
it. Some wanted to recognize or pro-
mote their pediatric specialty. Some 
wanted to set an example for their 
colleagues, who they are encourag-
ing to become certified. Some felt 
it was an important step forward 
for the profession and wanted to be 
a part of it. No matter the reason, 
the ABA applauds and thanks all 
those who took the examination,

Next Pediatric Audiology  
Specialty Certification Exam
Thursday, November 3, 2011 – 8:00–11:00 am
The next pediatric audiology examination will be administered 
prior to the Academy of  Doctors of  Audiology Convention,  
Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort, Bonita Springs, FL.

Exam applications are due October 3, 2011. 

American Board Of Audiology (ABA)
and commends the audiologists 
who passed the exam and have now 
received the Pediatric Audiology 
Specialty Certification.
This exam and certification, as 
with the Cochlear Implant Specialty 
Certification, was created with 
tremendous effort and dedication 
on the part of hundreds of pediatric 
audiologists who volunteered their 
time, resources, and expertise to this 
endeavor. The examination was first 
framed by the creation of subject 
areas, which are available on the ABA 
Web site at www.americanboardo-
faudiology.org. These areas were 
further delineated into sub-specialty 
areas and then weighted according 
to importance of knowledge for a 
pediatric audiologist.
Once the subject areas were 
finalized, additional subject mat-
ter experts (SMEs) were recruited to 
write, edit, and revise (and edit, and 
revise!) exam questions. A few hun-
dred exam questions were drafted so 
that future examinations could draw 
from a large pool and vary from any 
other exam that had been provided. 
The first group of candidates took the 
inaugural examination, after it had 
been Beta tested, with 150 questions 
so that each could be rated for per-
formance and a cut score (percentage 
of typical pediatric audiologists who 
would correctly answer each ques-
tion) be calculated. 
Finally, additional SMEs were 
recruited—along with existing 
experts—and the exam was reviewed. 
Every SME rated each question 
according to how he or she believed 
it should perform and weighted that 
against how it did perform, with 
the benefit of discussion among the 
SMEs. A final rating was given with  
a cumulative cut score calculated  
by the psychometrician assigned to 
this project. 
As you can see, the process was 
very involved, with each of the steps 
requiring months of work and many 
meetings and workshops. The result 
is a comprehensive and rigorous 
examination that truly tests the 
knowledge of a pediatric audiologist. 
It has become apparent that Pediatric 
Audiology Specialty Certification is 
meaningful and useful for identify-
ing audiologists who have chosen to 
make pediatrics their specialty area 
and have achieved additional train-
ing in this area.
Although only a handful of 
audiologists currently hold pediatric 
certification, it is already become 
the standard in this specialty area. 
Employers have begun to look 
at pediatric certification for an 
upcoming standard for their audi-
ologists. Primary care audiologists 
have already expressed interest in 
using pediatric certification as their 
standard for making referrals to 
pediatric specialists. Physicians and 
other health-care providers are sure 
to follow. With the ABA’s commit-
ment to maintaining the rigor of this 
examination and the high standards 
for maintaining pediatric certifica-
tion, there is no doubt that this will 
become the standard for pediatric 
specialists in audiology.

a candidate for certification in pedi-
atric audiology or cochlear implants,

of board certified audiologists, visit

Take the Pledge for Passage
By Melissa Sinden
O
ne of the most important 
things you can do for the 
profession of audiology takes 
only 30 seconds—contacting your 
representative in Congress. Perhaps 
you have grown tired of hearing that 
you need make this effort to advance 
audiology issues, but have you actually 
done it? If not, what’s stopping you? 
Here are the facts: members of 
Congress decide what initiatives to 
support or oppose based on feedback 
from their constituents (that’s you!)
So what message do they hear if 
they receive 100 e-mails from physi-
cians in their district who oppose 
an audiology bill and hear nothing 
from the audiologists they represent? 
The “message” is that more of the 
people they represent oppose the bill 
than favor it, so they should vote in 
opposition. Do we want physician 
groups influencing the future of audi-
ology? If the answer is no, I highly 
encourage you to take 30 seconds or 
less and send a message to your rep-
resentative through the Academy’s 
Legislative Action Center. Here’s how:
1.	 	Type http://capwiz.com/audi-
ology/home/ in your Internet 
address bar (You can also go to 
the homepage of the Academy 
Web site (www.audiology.org) and 
choose “Legislative Action Center” 
under the Advocacy header).
2.	 	There you will find letters for vari-
ous issues facing audiology. Click 
on “Ask your representative to 
Support Direct Access in the 112th 
Congress!” or any of the other 
letters.
3.	 	Enter your contact informa-
tion in the fields at the bottom 
of the screen. The Legislative 
Action Center will locate your 
representative for you. You can also 
edit the form letters if you wish.
4.	 	Click on “Send Message” and 
you’re done. You have taken the 
pledge for passage. 
During the month of July, both 
the Student Academy Board and the 
Academy’s Board of Directors made 
their way to Capitol Hill to visit with 
representatives and staff from their 
respective districts. That the student 
board members altered their plans 
to arrive a day early in order to visit 
the Hill, and that Academy board 
members devoted half of one day out 
of two work days for their meeting to 
participate, speaks to the importance 
of these actions. Your elected board 
members are leading by example. 
They took the pledge. 
Academy fellows cannot assume 
that “someone else will do it.” If 
every member takes the “pledge for 
passage” and commits to sending 
an email through the Academy’s 
Legislative Action Center, we could 
achieve direct access and obtain 
our first step toward greater profes-
sional autonomy. The success of that 
initiative would pave the road for 
countless future legislative achieve-
ments. It all starts with you. 
Melissa Sinden is the senior director of 
government relations for the American 
Academy of Audiology.

Phonak Gift Underwrites 
New Annual AudiologyNOW!® 
Lectureship
R
ichard Danielson, chair of the 
American Academy of Audiology 
Foundation Board of Trustees, recently 
announced that Phonak Hearing Systems 
has made a generous gift that will support 
a new lectureship series at AudiologyNOW! 
The grant of $67,500 will fund an annual 
educational program on workplace manage-
ment and business practices that result in 
improved audiological care for patients of all 
ages.
In making this announcement, Danielson 
explained that the idea had germinated fol-
lowing the Audiology and Industry Forum in 
2010. “During the meeting, many participants 
were vocal about the growing need for pro-
fession-wide education in business skills as a 
complement to audiologists’ clinical, techni-
cal, and scientific skills,” he stated. “Since the 
Foundation funds offerings at convention as 
part of its educational mission, the next step 
was to explore funding and implementation 
of a new multiyear lectureship program. Last 
fall, Mike Orscheln, Phonak’s president and 
CEO, and Dianne Meyer, then-chair of the 
Foundation board, began discussion about 
a possible industry partnership…and the 
rest, as they say, is history! On behalf of the 
Foundation board, I extend great appreciation 
to both of them for their leadership on this 
project. And of course, the Foundation thanks 
Phonak for the generous gift that will allow 
us to move forward with the lectureship at 
AudiologyNOW! next spring in Boston.”
This annual presentation will focus on 
practical skills for audiologists in a variety 
of practice settings who strive to improve 
audiology treatment delivery. Some topics 
under consideration include the develop-
ment and implementation of interpersonal 
and business practices that engage patients 
resulting in interaction that improve diag-
nosis and care, and ways that principles of 
patient psychology can be incorporated into 
different health-care delivery models. These 
topics may be discussed within the context 
of finance, human resources, time manage-
ment, quality control, marketing and other 
management concepts. In brief, the ultimate 
goal is to provide audiologists with additional 
skills that ensure that those with hearing-
impairment receive the highest level of 
hearing health care and that audiologists are 
better equipped to provide that care.  
Commenting on the announcement, 
Orscheln said, “Phonak is very excited to be 
engaged with the AAA Foundation to launch 
this dynamic lectureship. I am proud of the 
collaborative approach we took with Dianne 
Meyer and Kathleen Devlin Culver of the 
Foundation to bring this to fruition.” 
Look for more information on this exciting 
new lectureship series in the coming months. 
And again, the Foundation extends thanks 
and appreciation to the Phonak team for 
their support of this important educational 
opportunity.

AAAF Donor Spotlight: Melanie Herzfeld, AuD 
What made you first decide to donate 
to the American Academy of Audiology 
Foundation?
Early in my career, I worked with a physician 
whose philosophy was that “giving back” 
was mandatory. He actually encouraged and 
insisted that all of us in the office pick chari-
ties to receive donations and included many 
with which I was familiar. It was only a hop, 
skip, and jump away to realize that we also 
had to “give back” to our profession. Donating 
to the Foundation allows me to have a hand 
in helping those in need, helping doctoral 
candidates, and helping students. The goal of 
giving back to our profession is such a worthy 
one that it surprises me that everyone is not 
donating. Similar to other nonprofits, every 
dollar counts, so I would encourage all mem-
bers of the Academy to “give back” with a gift 
to the AAAF. Every single dollar counts.
Is there an aspect to the Foundation’s 
mission that you especially like or  
programs that you like to support?
Earmarking contributions is one way to make 
sure that some of the dollars you donate go 
to an effort in which you believe. As a former 
member of the ABA board of governors, I 
have restricted past gifts to support pediatric 
audiology, which supported the development 
of the ABA pediatric audiology specialty cer-
tification. Foundation support helped get the 
initiative off to a good start. And by the way, 
the second go round of this exam for spe-
cialty certification is scheduled for this fall, 
and I am thrilled my donation has contrib-
uted to this ongoing success.  
What do you think will change about  
the Foundation over the next five to  
ten years?
The Foundation has moved ahead and this 
year at AudiologyNOW! rocked its roots! We 
had an opportunity to bid on guitars signed 
by luminary rock stars, food baskets, and 
audiology tools. And the end result is that 
some doctoral student may receive some 
funding, some student may find he/she can 
attend AudiologyNOW!, and more support 
for other worthwhile causes funded by the 
Foundation. What a thrill to be a part of this! 
So perhaps next year, the Foundation will 
fund a seat at some university studying the 
effects of noise at some of the parties thrown 
at AudiologyNOW! Since they are preceded  
by increasing noise levels and are based on 
some fun, likely we will find out that the 
damage risk is minimal and a good time  
will be had by all.
What would you tell someone who 
is thinking about donating to the 
Foundation?
Join us next year at the Happy Hour with a 
View and find out how many of your fellow 
audiologists support the AAAF.
Now for something fun! We know  
audiologists rock, so if you had a band, 
what would you name it? 
Name a rock band? So not my thing!
