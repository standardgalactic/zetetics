SUMMARY
Continuous nanolattices are an emerging class of mechanical meta-
materials that are highly attractive due to their superior strength-
to-weight ratios, which originate from their spatial architectures
and nanoscale-sized elements possessing near-theoretical strength.
Rational design of frameworks remains challenging below 50 nm
because of limited methods to arrange small elements into complex
architectures. Here, we fabricate silica frameworks with 4- to
20-nm-thick elements using self-assembly and silica templating of
DNA origami nanolattices and perform in situ micro-compression
testing to examine the mechanical properties. We observe strong ef-
fects of lattice dimensions on yield strength (sy) and failure mode. Sil-
ica nanolattices are found to exhibit yield strengths higher than
those of any known engineering materials with similar mass density.
The robust coordination of the nanothin and strong silica elements
leads to the combination of lightweight and high-strength frame-
work materials offering an effective strategy for the fabrication of
nanoarchitected materials with superior mechanical properties.
INTRODUCTION
One of the longest-held pursuits of materials science and engineering has been the
production of lightweight, mechanically robust materials. In recent years, the ad-
vancements in top-down and bottom-up fabrications have allowed for the construc-
tion of 3D meso- and nanoscale periodic architected structures, which are often
referred to as meso-nano-lattices.1–6 Because a lattice consists of repeating motifs
of individual unit cells, the strength of these materials is determined by a complex
combination of the structure’s constituent materials, the unit cell structure, and
the length and width of the individual elements, or struts, of the lattice.3,7–10 In addi-
tion to lattice effects, nanoscale lattices typically possess high strength-to-weight ra-
tios because their nanosized elements exhibit ultrahigh strength due to the mechan-
ical size effect, or so-called ‘‘smaller is stronger’’ behavior.11–18 Sometimes, it is even
possible to obtain a yield strength higher than their corresponding fully dense bulk
solids when the size effect is stronger than the density effect.19
Due to the superior strength-to-weight ratio, nanolattices can provide a mechani-
cally robust open framework for several potential applications. Self-assembled
nanolattices as a sputtering template have allowed for the creation of a 3D super-
conducting architected structure as well as nanoengineered oxide structures for bat-
tery materials.20,21 Moreover, incorporation of functional nanoparticles into a lattice
enables nanostructured catalysis platforms.22 Self-assembly of nanoparticles using
such platforms has yielded applications toward broadband absorption surfaces,23
memory devices,24 and sensors.25 The possibility to generate nanostructures for
creating robust materials, as inspired by biomineralization, allows for extending ap-
plications as a biomaterial for bone or scaffolded tissue growth.26,27

All these applications certainly require the structural stability of nanolattices. There-
fore, there is a signiﬁcant need to develop effective methods that enable rational
design and fabrication of nanolattices with excellent mechanical properties that
eventually guarantee reliable performance for engineering devices. Moreover, for
a responsive nature of lattice elements, the prospect exists for establishing material
with dynamic and switchable mechanical behavior.28,29
The strength-to-weight ratio of nanolattices is strongly related to the dimensions of
the element sizes. At the nanoscale, a material often exhibits a signiﬁcant fraction of
theoretical strength due to the absence of defects, such as dislocations or cracks.
This is the reason why a nanowire or nanoparticle exhibits extremely high strengths.
For a given relative density and structural form of nanolattices, therefore, it is desir-
able to have a thinner element that could possess higher strength according to the
size effect. To obtain this beneﬁt, 3D photolithography has been extensively used
with a multitude of techniques, such as pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition, and elec-
troplating.18,20 While photolithography methods are effective in the production of
planar structures, they are quite time consuming and are limited in their ability to
produce architected 3D organization. In addition, producing nanoscale features
below 50 nm is challenging, which limits the beneﬁts of the size effect. Therefore,
novel fabrication strategies are required for generating designed 3D nanostructured
materials via bottom-up fabrication. Such materials should consist of extremely thin
elements and would allow for creating continuous nanolattices (frameworks) with a
signiﬁcantly enhanced strength-to-weight ratio.
In recent years, DNA frames have been demonstrated as essential nanoscale blocks
to form a wide variety of nanoarchitectures starting from individual polyhedral
frames.30 The frames are a DNA molecule formed by folding a long single strand
of DNA with many small ‘‘staple’’ strands, which twist and shape the long sequence
into a pre-deﬁned shape. This so-called DNA origami approach31 allows us to form
engineered 3D shapes.32 The frame shape is encoded further with sequences at
vertices that pair with a neighboring frame to form extended nanolattices.33 Internal
staple strands not involved in the macroscopic assembly can be switched out to
allow for addressing individual frames for further pairing with DNA-functionalized
nanoparticles or other tags. The connectivity of these structures depends on the
design of frames and their connectivity, which makes a variety of lattice types
possible for assembly and exploration. These ordered DNA frameworks can further-
more be transitioned to the solid state via sol-gel synthesis of silica and more com-
plex material compositions,6,34–36 which produces the elements with 10–20 nm in
thickness, below the limit of photolithography-generated nanolattices.1 The DNA-
programmable assembly offers a high-throughput technique that can be potentially
scaled up with the falling cost of DNA oligonucleotides.37 The time to produce a
large number of high-quality origami and subsequent lattices ranges from hours38
to days39 and can be reduced through optimizing kinetic effects, and the structure
can be engineered with high uniformity.40 The structural similarity of the DNA-based
framework nanolattice to those proposed by these models positions it uniquely to
potentially achieve lightweight and high-strength materials.
In this study, we investigated self-assembled cuboid DNA silica frameworks with the
octahedron coordination of 4- to 20-nm-thick elements, and their mechanical prop-
erties were investigated using in situ micro-compression in a scanning electron mi-
croscope (SEM). This lattice has an average coordination of struts of 8, which is
above that required for rigidity of Maxwell lattices, which typically have coordination
z, twice the dimensionality of the strut design.41 We found a strong effect of lattice

dimension on yield strength and failure mode. Advanced electron microscopy re-
vealed that the effect of lattice dimension is strongly related to the presence of lat-
tice defects. Surprisingly, all silica nanolattices in this study exhibit yield strength
much higher than any other engineering materials with a similar mass density, with
the best performance close to the theoretical maximum. These results imply that
DNA self-assembly technique offers a ﬂexible pathway to fabricate mechanically
robust materials through engineering nanoscale architecture and composition.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Fabrication of silica nanolattices
Fabrication of DNA-based cuboid silica nanolattices starts with a single DNA octa-
hedron, which has an edge length of approximately 29 nm (Figures 1A and 1B).
The octahedron frames form nanolattice structures by the vertex-to-vertex connec-
tions between the frames. Each octahedron is coordinated with 6 neighboring
octahedrons with complementary DNA at the vertices. The DNA octahedron unit
structure repeats in space to yield a cubic nanolattice with an edge length varying
between 1 and 10 mm (Figure 1C). Nanolattices are then coated with silica using a
sol-gel process using (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS).34,36 The thickness of the silica coating is on the order of
2–10 nm radially around the DNA strut, yielding 4- to 20-nm-thick struts in
diameter. The details of nanolattice fabrication are available in the experimental
procedures. Note that we intentionally chose the octahedron-structured nanolattice
because its stretching-dominant deformation behavior guarantees superior yield
strength8,15,42; however, we note that the achieved density of the samples likely
means that there are shared contributions of stretching and bending deformation
in the samples.

Ductile and brittle deformation
The synthesis yield of a single batch of nanolattices is quite high, providing a large
number of lattices of varying sizes. The lattices tend to cluster in large mounds
(10–100) with a few isolated lattices located in between. Of these isolated parti-
cles, only those of a cuboid geometry were selected for micro-compression
testing. To this end, samples within a size range of 1.2–8 mm were compressed,
with the majority of lattices tested clustering around 3 mm. The cubic geometry
of the nanolattice allowed for the direct uniaxial compression of nanolattices
sitting upright on a silicon substrate. Small nanolattices (edge length < 3 mm)
with a high yield strength of above 2 GPa typically yielded a signiﬁcant plastic
deformation (Figures 2A, 2B, and S8; Videos S1 and S2). Large nanolattices
(edge length > 3 mm) tended to fail with one or two sudden bursts (Figures 2C
and 2D) wherein little to no plastic deformation occurred in the sample prior to
fracture. About 54% of large nanolattices exhibited complete brittle fracture. It
is interesting that small nanolattices exhibit ductile deformation since, traditionally,
silica is known as a very brittle material. We believe that this ductile deformation
originates from the nanoscale size effect of the silica coating the structure. It has
been reported that silica nanoﬁbers undergo a size-dependent brittle-to-ductile
transition at diameters below 18 nm.43 The study postulated that the increase in
relative surface area due to the extremely small diameter of the ﬁbers allows for
dangling oxygen bonds to quickly move to uncoordinated Si atoms, forming
new Si–O bonds as the sample undergoes tension and the original bonds are
broken. If the rate of this bond-switching process exceeds irreversible bond loss,
ﬂaws can be blunted, and the entire sample can be deformed via shear banding
instead of crack propagation. It was also noted that at 5-nm diameter, the ﬁbers
were capable of 18% elongation before failure, a similar diameter to that of the
octahedral struts in this study.

The diameters of our strut members range between 4 and 20 nm, as estimated from
direct cross-section measurement (Figures S3–S6), and the ductility seen under
compression thus suggests that the silica in our smaller samples undergo shear
deformation. However, the large nanolattices exhibit brittle fracture even though
the structure and dimensions of the octahedron unit cell do not change. This result
implies the presence of other factors such as lattice defects, which could induce
crack initiation and propagation at lower stress levels. An early consideration is
that surfaces of nanolattices that do not present an atomically ﬂat surface for contact
with the indenter act as stress concentration points. The irregularity of the surface or
direct misalignment from perfectly ﬂat to the indenter are corrected after initial con-
tact with the indenter, which is present in the data as a low slope at the very begin-
ning of the stress-strain data (see Figures S7 and S8). Both Young’s modulus and
yield strength were obtained from the stress-strain data measured after full contact.
Size-dependent strength of nanolattices
The presence of defects is indirectly observed in size-dependent yield strength and
Young’s modulus. Nanolattices show high yield strength using a 1% strain offset15,44
ranging from 0.5 to 4.8 GPa (Figure 3A, Table S1), and as the edge length of the
nanolattice increased, the yield strength decreases (Figure 3B). A similar trend

regarding the Young’s modulus is also shown with modulus varying from 30 down to
<5 GPa (Figure 3C). The Young’s modulus of bulk fused silica has been measured to
be 72 GPa, and it has been observed that the Young’s modulus for silica is relatively
unaffected by size.45 One inference that might be made from the apparent decrease
in the yield strength is the potential variability of the nanolattice silica coating. How-
ever, when examining lattices by focused ion beam (FIB)/SEM cross-section, we
could see no large variation in the thickness of the silica growth, which was consis-
tently between 4 and 10 nm. Representative regions can be seen in Figure 3B.
Pore size ranging from 15 to 20 nm remained consistent across sample sizes (see
Figure S3).
Having interrogated the structure for variations in the thickness and continuity of the
silica coating, cross-sectional analysis yielded a direct view of defects within the
nanolattices (Figure S6; Table S2), where the most common defects seen were va-
cancies and voids. This observation suggested that the decreasing yield strength
with increasing nanolattice sample size is related to the larger number of defects.
Octahedral vacancy occurrences range between 0.07% and 0.8% or 1:125 or
1:1,100 for the lowest defect occurrence. Each octahedral vacancy represents
approximately a 0.1% increase in void space. The total defect porosity from large
voids and defective regions within the crystal represents between 0.5% and 11%
void space. The low Young’s modulus for larger nanolattices that exhibited brittle
failure can be explained by the presence of these large voids, which most likely
contribute to catastrophic failure of the nanolattice. Under compression, friction
stresses typically induce barreling around the pore, which introduces lateral tensile
stresses that initiate a crack from the pore, thus leading to catastrophic failure under
lower stresses (shown in Figure S7 and Video S3).
In light of the ﬂaw-driven process described, we can estimate the critical length scale
for fracture in the silica nanolattice compared with the defect-free lattice following
Grifﬁths criterion and the surface energy of fused silica, 3.5–5 J/m2.46,47 The esti-
mated critical length scale for silica is 15–22 nm for a theoretical strength of E/10
and 139–200 nm for E/30, respectively. In our case, since the silica thickness is in
the range of 4–10 nm, we can assume that the silica struts are ﬂaw insensitive and
thus able to reach theoretical strength. This explains the observed high strength
of nanolattices with small domain sizes. Both the ﬂaw insensitivity and the enhanced
Si–O bond switching at the nanoscale promote high strength and ductility of the
relatively homogenous domains.
The visualization of the large disordered region in Figure 3B corresponds to the cor-
relation length of nanolattices obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),
which is on the order of 0.5–1 mm (Figure S1). Beyond the correlation length, we
would expect that voids and disordered regions like the one visualized are more
likely to develop. Octahedron vacancies are easily accommodated in the nanolat-
tice; a missing octahedron in the structure can be circumvented as the nanolattice
grows in parallel directions (Figure 3B). This means that the quantity of octahedron
vacancies increases with the size of the nanolattice sample due to the stochastic na-
ture of defects forming in larger volume. These two phenomena (vacancies and
voids) are likely the root cause for the decrease in the strength with increased nano-
lattice sample size (Figure 3C); thus, the increase in defect volume creates easy di-
rections for crack propagation and deterioration of stability. This effect resembles
a behavior of yield strength for atomic crystalline materials, for which an exponential
dependence is observed of the form s = Adn, where d is the pillar diameter.14
Although the exponent n cannot be accurately assessed in our case due to the

limited dynamic range of edge length, its estimated value is 0.8–0.9. Additionally,
the role of missing beams was studied on nanoscale octet-trusses, where Meza et
al. observed an exponential scaling of stiffness, n = 3–3.8, and strength, m = 3.1–
4.3, which roughly translates to a factor of 2 decrease in yield strength and stiffness
for 20% missing beams, similar to what is shown in this study.48 The mechanism
described for the weakening of the lattice due to nanovoids and nanopores likely ex-
plains the dual modalities of failure noted earlier, with smaller, more defect-free lat-
tices failing with ductile behavior as struts stretch after yielding versus large brittle
failure, which exploits weaknesses in the volume of the sample.
Comparison with other types of nanolattices
To compare the compressive strength of the nanolattice against other structures, we
assess the density of the obtained lattices, summarized in Figure 4A with an Ashby
plot. This was done by extrapolating density directly from volumetric imaging of
the structure with electron microscopy and, second, by inspection of the stress-strain
curve. From the unit cell, we can approximate a theoretical relative density of an octa-
hedral unit cell geometrically as 12 cylindrical struts in a box, which can be shown for
an edge length, l, to be rlattice =

lÞ2. Given an average strut radius, r, of 6–7 nm and
an edge length of 29 nm, the total density of a defect-free lattice would be 57%–77%
of the bulk material, respectively. This compares well against direct volumetric imag-
ing via serial section reconstruction of a section of nanolattices shown in Figures 4B
and S4. The obtained ﬁlling fraction value ranges from 66% to 77% depending on
the thresholding technique (Otsu thresholding yields 66%). For bulk silica with a den-
sity of 2,200 kg/m3, this would translate to 1,400–1,700 kg/m3. However, given the
Figure 4. Ashby chart
(A) Compressive strength vs. density plot. Silica framework materials in this study have a density on the order of 2,000 kg/m3 with yield strength of
between 1 and 4.8 GPa, which roughly corresponds with edge length, as shown in Figure 3C. The color coding of framework samples corresponds to
their different edge lengths, according to a color bar scale. The ﬁndings compare favorably with other nanolattices such as alumina and carbon based,
with representative examples shown.

stochastic nature of voids in the assembly process, it is difﬁcult to ascertain the den-
sity with a high degree of conﬁdence at the outset.
In a second method, we extrapolated the relative density of each sample by exam-
ining rm  Elattice=Ebulk, where m represents the inﬂuence of architecture, where
stretching-dominant structures are expected to have an m 1.7,18,49,50 The expected

2. Additionally the r/l ratio of 0.24 suggests that the rela-
tive inﬂuences of stretching and bending are comparable and that the expected m
scaling should be 2 for the cuboctahedron-type lattice.48
In our study, the smallest lattices display Young’s moduli approximately 50% that of
the bulk (72 GPa), as shown in Figure 3D. Larger nanolattices with higher chances for
voids to develop and weaken the structure have correspondingly lower Young’s
moduli and yield strengths. This effect is reﬂected in the distribution of measured
yield strengths for lattices with different edge lengths (Figure 4A).
Another prominent possibility for the variance in the Young’s modulus is that the sil-
ica itself formed via sol-gel synthesis. The size effect on silica nanowires is said to rely
on a large surface area-to-volume ratio, which leads to elastic stiffening related to
surface elasticity, which may depend on the synthesis of the silica itself.51 The
network structure our silica forms is calcined prior to nanoindentation in an attempt
to saturate bonds to form SiO2. However, the decomposition of DNA along with the
buffer solutions used to keep DNA stable in solution has a tendency to leave behind
various carbon, phosphorous, and nitrogen impurities in the silica network, which
likely leaves bonds unsaturated or even creates nanoporosity in the struts of the
structure.35 The effect will be the subject of further examination where varying thick-
nesses and nanolattice types can better conﬁrm how the architecture affects the
scaling of Young’s modulus.
When plotting compressive strength vs. density, it becomes clear that the lattices
are near the theoretical maximum yield strength, where here we consider the Voigt
upper bound (sy  E/10  7 GPa for silica) and the Suquet upper bound, see Figure
S2 for Poisson ratio.16 For the modulus of bulk fused silica of 72 GPa and 70% ﬁlling,
the theoretical yield strength can be estimated as 5 GPa.51,52 Using the direct volu-
metric calculation for density, the smallest nanolattices displayed sy 4.5 GPa, or
90% theoretical yield strength. Our DNA silica nanolattice is thus competitive in
the pantheon of lightweight, high-strength materials, as illustrated in the Ashby
plot in Figure 4. Relative to other nanoscale nanolattices7,16,48,53–55 and meshes, it
can be seen that DNA-templated frameworks have a high yield strength nearing
the theoretical maximum limit for the given density.
In closing, we have demonstrated that DNA frames assembled in a lattice and tem-
plated with silica present a class of engineered mechanical metamaterials with high
strength (1–5 GPa) and light weight. Since DNA assembly methods are capable of
creating diverse lattice types by modifying a frame geometry and a connectivity of
frames, the demonstrated approach opens up a possibility to create materials
with different mechanical responses. Moreover, the development of templating
methods6,20,34,35,56 provides a means to exploit different elemental compositions
of frameworks. The work will provide a pathway for the creation of mechanically
robust nanolattices that can be further coupled with nanoscale functions for future
technologies including superconductors, battery cathodes, nanophotonics, and
catalysis.

Synthesis
DNA origami and AuNP-nanolattice assembly
DNA-origami octahedrons39 (see Note S1) were formed by mixing M13mp18 DNA
scaffold and DNA staple strands with a 1:5 ratio in 13 TAE buffer (40 mM Tris ace-
tate, 1 mM EDTA) with 12.5 mM Mg2+ and being slowly annealed from 90C to
room temperature over the course of 20 h for origami formation, overall a 0.2
C/h ramp rate. Nanolattices of DNA origami were formed by mixing two DNA octa-
hedrons with complementary DNA bases at the vertices. The origami was then
mixed to form a 20 nM concentration solution at 20–50 mL. The sample was annealed
in a PCR over 5 days from 50C to room temperature (RT) at 0.2/h.
Silica mineralization
Robust DNA origami nanolattices were made by growing a layer of silica on the DNA
bundle. For conversion to inorganic silica, nanolattices were centrifuged, and superna-
tant was replaced with 0.13 TAE with 10 mM Mg. Separately, silication buffer was pre-
pared by adding 2.5 mL APTES and 10 mL TEOS in 0.13 TAE with 10 mM Mg buffer for a
total volume of 500 mL. The solution was vortexed at 700 rpm for 30 min and ﬁltered with
a 0.22 mm Millex-GV PVDF ﬁlter to remove large particulates, and then 5 mL nanolattice
and 10 mL silication buffer were mixed in a tube. The solution was vortexed at 700 rpm for
1–2 h and then centrifuged and buffer exchanged with water. Structural conﬁrmation of
the structure using SAXS (see Figure S1) showed the resultant superlattice structure cor-
responded to a simple cubic structure factor with a lattice parameter of 49 nm. The sam-
ple was drop casted onto a silica wafer and then annealed at 500C to remove DNA and
fully convert the lattice to silicon dioxide.
Samples were sectioned to evaluate their porosity using the Helios 650 series FIB/
SEM. The images can be seen in Figure S3. The cutting was performed at 30 KeV
and 28 pA beam current. Samples were cut to approximately half their volume. Pores
were measured manually using ImageJ. Volumetric reconstruction from serial
sectioning of nanolattices was performed at CUNY ASRC FIB/SEM and is described
in Figure S4.
In situ compression test
Compression tests were performed on two in situ micro-mechanical testing systems.
The ﬁrst system was a combination of a JEOL 6335F ﬁeld-emission gun SEM (JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan) for imaging and micro-mechanical compression testing performed in
situ using a NanoFlip system (KLA, Milpitas, CA, USA) outﬁtted with a 15-mm-diam-
eter diamond ﬂat-punch tip. The second system was an FEI Helios FIB/SEM for

imaging and a micro-mechanical testing device, FT-NMT04 (Femtotools, Buchs,
Switzerland), with a 5-mm-diameter diamond ﬂat-punch tip.
Only isolated nanolattices with a cuboid geometry and ﬂat orientation were chosen
for compression. The lattices were compressed with a nominal displacement rate of
10 nm/s, which corresponds to an approximate strain rate of 103 s1. Samples were
loaded until failure in the case of brittle samples and to 40% plastic strain in the
case of ductile deformation. The yield strength was estimated using either a 0.2%
or 1% strain offset from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve.
