Gravity and Precession of the Earth

The Earth’s Gravity
Erastothenes of Cyrene, a third-century BCE. Greek, is com-
monly regarded as the father of modern geography. He not
only regarded the Earth as a sphere but succeeded in cal-
culating its circumference by measuring the diﬀerence in the
length of the shadows cast at noon in localities a consider-
able distance apart in a north-south direction. He was also
the ﬁrst to calculate the tilt of the Earth’s axis. That is where
matters stood until the seventeenth century when observers
noted that the Earth was not a perfect sphere. Isaac Newton
put forth the notion that because of the centrifugal force the
Earth was in fact better approximated as an oblate ﬂattened
ellipsoid. The next signiﬁcant advance was Alexis Clairaut’s
publication in 1743 of Theorie de la ﬁgure de la terre. This
contains a theorem on the variation of the gravitational accel-
eration over the Earth. We return to this in Sec. (2.2) below.

Fermi takes up the story by considering the variations of
the acceleration due to gravity over the Earth’s surface. Ta-
ble (2.1) contains the values of various physical quantities
used by Fermi.
In Table (2.1), a is the equatorial semi-axis
of the Earth, b is the polar semi-axis, Tsol is the length of a
solar day, Tsid is the length of a sidereal day, G is Newton’s
gravitational constant, ge is the acceleration due to gravity
at the equator (including centrifugal eﬀects), and gp is the
acceleration due to gravity at the poles.
A solar day can
be deﬁned to a very good approximation using a simple sun-
dial. With an approximate error of only 30 s/year, a solar
day is the time it takes the sundial’s shadow to make a ﬁrst
return to a speciﬁc position. The ﬁgure of Tsol = 86, 400 s is
24 h/day × 60 min/h × 60 s/min. A sidereal day is approx-
imately 4 min shorter than a solar day. It is measured by
considering the Earth’s rotational motion with respect to the
far away or “ﬁxed” stars rather than with respect to the Sun.
In most of our subsequent discussion, the distinction between
Tsol and Tsid will not play a role and will be ignored. How-
ever, for the interested reader, more detail on the distinction
between Tsol and Tsid is provided in Appendix A.

The quantity known as the “ﬂattening” is
a −b

(2.1)
where f is a commonly used notation. Fermi writes
a −b
a
=

297,
(2.2)
a value which follows from the data in the table.
For the
volume of the Earth, he gives
V = 1.082 × 1027 cm3.
(2.3)
This is close to the value obtained by assuming the Earth is
an ellipsoid of revolution. For that case, we have
V = 4
3πa2b = 1.083 × 1027cm3.
Fermi then goes on to an elementary calculation of the mass
of the Earth assuming the Earth is a sphere of radius Re =
a, with acceleration due to gravity given by g = 980 cm2/s.
Newton’s law of gravity states
g = GMe

(2.5)
comparable to the current best value of 5.97× 1027g. For the
density of the Earth, Fermi gives
ρ = M
V = 5.5 g/cm3,
similar to the current value of 5.51 g/cm3. It should be noted
that the numerical values given by Fermi are typically correct
to “slide rule accuracy,” the slide rule famously being Fermi’s
personal hand calculator. This occasionally leads to discrep-
ancies in the second decimal place. From here on, we will not
comment on this sort of discrepancy.

CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
2.2
The Earth’s Gravitational
Potential
Geographical Coordinates
Suppose we set up a coordi-
nate system with the origin at the center of mass of the Earth,
and the positive z axis pointing north along the Earth’s axis
of symmetry Any point can be speciﬁed relative to this co-
ordinate system by giving its spherical coordinates; r, θ, φ,
where r is the distance of the point from the center of mass,
and θ and φ are the usual polar and azimuthal angles. For
a point on the surface of the Earth, θ is often called the “co-
latitude,” the latitude being |θ −90◦|, plus the designation
N or S, depending on whether θ is less than or greater than
90◦.1 The azimuthal angle φ is closely related to the longi-
tude. The longitude of a point on the Earth’s surface is the
angle along a circle of constant latitude, measured either east
or west from the Prime Meridian, which runs through Green-
wich, a borough of London. Following Fermi, we will use the
spherical coordinates θ and φ.
Nonspherical Eﬀects
Having deﬁned our coordinates, let
us turn to the gravitational potential due to the masses in the
Earth. We denote the Earth’s gravitational potential as Vg.
There are, of course, gravitational eﬀects near the Earth that
arise from the Moon, the Sun, and other planets and stars,
for example the precession of the equinoxes and the tides.
These are discussed in Sec. (2.5) and Chap. (10), respectively.
However, with respect to the gravitational acceleration near
the Earth, the eﬀects of other astronomical bodies can be
neglected compared to those that come from the Earth itself.
The gravitational potential due to the Earth has a value at
1For example, the latitude of Chicago is 41.9◦N, while that of Buenos
Aires is 34.6◦S.

2.2. EARTH’S GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
11
any point inside, outside, or on the Earth. For a small mass
µ which is acted upon by the Earth’s gravity, the potential
energy is µVg. Since gravity is an attractive force, we expect
Vg < 0, with −µVg being the work required to move the mass
µ out of the Earth’s ﬁeld to inﬁnity.
Although the gravitational potential at points inside the
Earth is certainly of interest, we will restrict the present dis-
cussion to points outside the Earth or on its surface. In this
region, satellite measurements have determined the Earth’s
gravitational eﬀects with great accuracy. To start oﬀ, sup-
pose the Earth were perfectly spherical. In that case, Vg is
very simple;
Vg = V (0)
g
= −GMe
r
.
(2.6)
It is one of the remarkable features of Newton’s law of gravity
that for a spherical body the gravitational potential obeys
Eq. (2.6) at any point outside or on the surface of the body.
But the Earth is not perfectly spherical. As brieﬂy mentioned
at the beginning of Sec. (2.1), it is slightly oblate, with a larger
radius at the equator than at the poles. (See Table (2.1).) It is
clear that the zeroth-order term V (0)
g
needs to be augmented
by a correction term, which must depend on the polar angle
θ, in addition to r.
There is a systematic procedure for ﬁnding angle-dependent
corrections to V (0)
g
. This is to make use of the fact that, out-
side of the Earth’s mass distribution, the complete gravita-
tional potential satisﬁes Laplace’s equation,
∇2Vg = 0.
(2.7)
Eq. (2.7) is directly analogous to the statement that away
from any charges, the electric potential satisﬁes Laplace’s
equation.

12
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
If the Earth’s oblateness is the only nonspherical feature
that needs to be included, a correction term of the form
3 cos2 θ −1
r3
(2.8)
is suﬃcient. It is easy to check that the formula of Eq. (2.8)
satisﬁes the Laplace equation. Adding a term of this form to
V (0)
g
, we now may write
Vg = V (0)
g
+ V (2)
g
+ . . .
(2.9)
= −GMe
r
[1 −1
2J2(a
r )2(3 cos2 θ −1) + . . .]
In Eq. (2.9), a is the Earth’s equatorial radius, and J2 is a di-
mensionless parameter whose modern value is J2 = 1.0826 ×
10−3. It is fair to ask, what property of the Earth’s mass
distribution determines the value of J2? As will be explained
in Sec. (2.4), the answer is that J2 is determined by the mo-
ments of inertia of the Earth. The terms denoted by + . . . in
Eq. (2.9) represent a sum over higher-order corrections that
can account for more detailed angular dependence than V (2)
g
.
The general form of the lth term in the series is
Nl(θ, φ)
rl+1
,
(2.10)
where l = 3, 4, . . . , and Nl is a polynomial (Legendre func-
tion) of order l in cos θ and sin θ, where a factor of sin θ is
accompanied by either cos φ or sin φ. The terms with l > 2
are all very small, but it is of interest that modern satellite
measurements have determined their strength up to approx-
imately l = 40. Such terms will not be needed in our subse-
quent discussion, and we will use only the explicitly written
terms in Eq. (2.9) from here on.

2.2. EARTH’S GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
13
Centrifugal Eﬀects
The Earth is rotating, so a position
ﬁxed with respect to the Earth is in a rotating coordinate
system and centrifugal eﬀects must be taken into account.
Recall that in elementary physics a mass µ, which is rotating
at angular frequency ω experiences a “centrifugal force.” For
a mass located at a distance of r⊥from the axis of rotation,
the centrifugal force is
µr⊥ω2
and points away from the axis of rotation. The centrifugal
force can be derived from a centrifugal potential, given by
Vcent = −1
2r2
⊥ω2.
(2.11)
Denoting the centrifugal force on a mass µ as Fcent, we have
Fcent = −µ∇Vcent = µω2r⊥.
(2.12)
Returning to the case of the Earth’s rotation and using spher-
ical coordinates, r⊥is just the distance from the Earth’s axis
and is given by r⊥= r sin θ. The centrifugal potential be-
comes
Vcent = −1
2(rω sin θ)2,
(2.13)
and ω = 2π/Tsid. Adding Vcent to our expression for Vg from
Eq. (2.9) and dropping all angular dependence from Legendre
functions with l > 2, , the total potential is
Vtot = −GMe
r
[1 −1
2J2(a
r )2(3 cos2 θ −1)] −1
2(rω sin θ)2.
(2.14)
The local acceleration due to gravity and centrifugal eﬀects
is deﬁned as
g = −∇Vtot.
(2.15)
Evaluating g using Eq. (2.15) at the equator, the spherically
symmetric term in Vtot gives ∼980 cm/s2. The J2 term is

14
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
∼1.6 cm/s2. The centrifugal term is ∼3.4 cm/s2. We see that
the spherically symmetric term is dominant, while the J2 and
centrifugal terms are much smaller.
It is important to note that in a rotating coordinate sys-
tem, Newton’s second law is modiﬁed in two ways, commonly
known as centrifugal and Coriolis forces.
The addition of
Vcent to Vg does account for centrifugal eﬀects, but it leaves
out the Coriolis force. The latter comes into play only when
the body being considered is moving relative to the Earth,
e.g., a part of the atmosphere which is in motion as in a storm,
discussed further in Sec. (6). For a body of mass µ hanging at
rest from a string connected to an earthbound support, there
is no Coriolis force and the tension in the string is given by
T = −µ∇Vtot = µg.
This provides a simple way to measure g.
Equipotentials and Gravitational Acceleration
What
is commonly called Clairaut’s theorem, is an equation for the
gravitational acceleration on the Earth’s surface as a function
of latitude or equivalently, the polar angle θ. As will be seen
below, it is easy to derive from our expression for Vtot as given
in Eq. (2.14) and holds at the same level of accuracy. Using
Eq. (2.15) to obtain g leads to an expression of the form
g = gr ˆr + gθ ˆθ.
(2.16)
Both gr and gθ depend on r and θ.
To proceed, one needs to ﬁnd the surface of the Earth.
Speciﬁcally, for a given latitude or polar angle, what is the
value of r that corresponds to being at the surface of the
Earth? The answer to this question depends on the notion
of equipotential, an equipotential being a surface on which

2.2. EARTH’S GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
15
Vtot is constant. An important property of an equipotential
is that the gravitational force on a mass is always perpendic-
ular to the equipotential surface on which the mass is located.
A ﬂuid cannot support a force tangent to its surface, so the
surface of a ﬂuid which is in mechanical equilibrium will coin-
cide with a gravitational equipotential. As a simple example
of this, consider a handheld container of water. If the con-
tainer is tilted, the surface of the water remains horizontal
at a constant elevation h, and therefore at a constant value
of the local gravitational potential, gh. Applying this same
reasoning to the Earth as a whole, it is clear that the surface
of the ocean must be an equipotential. Moving onto dry land,
the average elevation over the surface of the Earth is ∼800 m,
so the value of Vtot increases on average by only one part in
104. This is a very small amount. It is then well within the
accuracy of our formula for Vtot to assume that the Earth’s
surface is an equipotential.
Assuming this to be true, Vtot must take the same value
at any point on its surface. In particular this includes the
equator and the poles, where r takes the values a and b,
respectively. We have
Vtot(a, 90◦) = Vtot(b, 0).
(2.17)
It will be useful to introduce a dimensionless parameter which
characterizes the contribution of the centrifugal term. Follow-
ing Fermi, we deﬁne m (not a mass) by
m = a3ω2
GMe
.
(2.18)
We now have three small dimensionless parameters: f, J2,
and m. The formulas that follow will be correct to ﬁrst or-
der in these small parameters.
Higher-order terms will be
dropped. Writing out Vtot(a, 90◦), we have
Vtot(a, 90◦) = −GMe
a
[1 + J2
2 + m
2 ].
(2.19)

16
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
Doing the same at r = b, θ = 0, we have
Vtot(b, 0) = −GMe
b
[1 −J2(a
b )2].
(2.20)
We may simplify this expression by keeping only ﬁrst-order
terms. Since J2 is already ﬁrst order, we may make the re-
placement a/b →1 in its coeﬃcient. Using the deﬁnition of
the ﬂattening from Eq. (2.1), we have b/a = 1 −f. Using this
to rewrite the ﬁrst term in Eq. (2.20), we have
GMe
b
= GMe
a
(a
b ) = GMe
a
1
1 −f ∼GMe
a
(1 + f).
(2.21)
Our ﬁnal, correct to ﬁrst order, expression for Vtot(b, 0) is
Vtot(b, 0) = −GMe
a
[1 + f −J2].
(2.22)
Equating this to Vtot(a, 0), we obtain
−GMe
a
[1 + f −J2] = −GMe
a
[1 + J2
2 + m
2 ].
(2.23)
Canceling terms, we ﬁnally have
f = 3
2J2 + 1
2m,
(2.24)
so only two of our three small parameters are independent
quantities. Using modern data, Eq. (2.24) is accurate to a
part in a thousand, so the approximation of working to ﬁrst
order is a very good one.
Eq. (2.24) will be used in what follows, but we still must
ﬁnd the value of r that corresponds to being on the Earth’s
surface for an arbitrary polar angle θ. The work done above
motivates the following trial form,
r(θ) = a(1 −f cos2 θ).
(2.25)

2.2. EARTH’S GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL
17
This certainly works at θ = 0◦, 90◦, and 180◦, but many other
formulas would also work for these angles. What singles out
Eq. (2.25) is that when r(θ) from Eq. (2.25) is substituted
in Eq. (2.14) for Vtot, the result is constant, independent of
θ, implying that an equipotential has been reached, to ﬁrst
order. The elementary steps showing this will not be written
out, but it is worth noting that the cancellation of all factors
of cos2 θ is a direct consequence of Eq. (2.24).
Clairaut’s Formula
Knowing the parameters of the Earth’s
surface, we can now evaluate the acceleration due to gravity
on it. What we want is the magnitude of the gravitational
acceleration, as given by
g(θ) ≡

(∂Vtot
∂r )2 + (1
r
∂Vtot
∂θ )2
1/2
,
(2.26)
where r is evaluated using Eq. (2.25) after the derivatives are
taken. Since the term involving ∂/∂θ is the square of a ﬁrst-
order term and therefore of second order, the value of g(θ)
correct to ﬁrst order is given by the simpler formula
g(θ) = |∂Vtot
∂r |.
(2.27)
Evaluating the derivative, and substituting for r(θ) from Eq. (2.25),
we obtain
g(θ) = GMe
a2 [(1 + 3
2J2 −m) + (2f −9
2J2 + m) cos2 θ]. (2.28)
Eliminating J2 using Eq. (2.24), we ﬁnd
g(θ) = GMe
a2 [(1 + f −3
2m) + (5
2m −f) cos2 θ].
(2.29)
The equator is at θ = 90◦, so setting geq = g(90◦), we have
geq = GMe
a2 (1 + f −3
2m),
(2.30)

18
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
and, again dropping higher-order terms, g(θ) becomes
g(θ) = geq[1 + (5
2m −f) cos2 θ].
(2.31)
This is Clairaut’s formula. As treated here, it is a ﬁrst-order
expression so not really a “theorem.” Pursuing this point a bit
further, Clairaut’s formula can be an exact result or theorem
if certain detailed assumptions are made about the Earth’s
internal structure. It is in the spirit of Fermi’s approach to
physics to derive it as we have done from the form of the
gravitational potential near the Earth, rather than to model
the interior of the Earth. Nevertheless, theorem or formula, it
is a remarkable expression. As we will see in the next section,
it gives a quite accurate description of the acceleration due
to gravity at various points on the Earth.
The Accuracy of Clairaut’s Formula
Clairaut’s formula
is remarkably accurate for the variation of g over the Earth.
Using modern values of ge, m and f taken from Table 2 of (Yo-
der 1995; Ahrens 1995), and evaluating g(θ) using Eq. (2.27),
Clairaut’s formula for g(θ) becomes
g(θ) = 978.03 + 5.18 cos2 θ,
(2.32)
where g(θ) is expressed in cm/s2, and we have retained ﬁve
signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Recalling that the latitude is |θ −90◦|,
Eq. (2.32) is used to compute the local value of g(θ) for several
locations.

From Table (2.2) it is seen that Clairaut’s theorem is accurate
at the 0.1% level.
2.3
Pressure at the Center of the Earth
Fermi also does a simple calculation of the pressure at the
center of the Earth.
The Earth’s rotation and slight non-
sphericity are very small eﬀects here and are ignored. The
Earth is taken to be spherically symmetric, of radius Re, and
in hydrostatic equilibrium. The equation of hydrostatic equi-
librium for a point inside the Earth is
−∇p + ρg = 0,
(2.33)
where p is the pressure, g is the acceleration due to gravity,
and ρ is the mass density. The acceleration is related to the
gravitational potential by
g = −∇Vg.
(2.34)
For a spherically symmetric Earth, we have
g = −ˆrg(r),
(2.35)

(2.36)
and M(r) is the mass inside a sphere of radius r,
M(r) = 4π
Z r
0
ρ(r)r2dr.
(2.37)
Evaluation of this integral requires a model for ρ(r). The sim-
plest possible assumption would be to use the average density
of the Earth for ρ(r). However, this ignores the fact that the
density at the center of the Earth must be signiﬁcantly larger
than the density at the surface. Fermi chooses the next sim-
plest model by taking
ρ(r) = ρ0 −ρ1r.
(2.38)
(We slightly changed Fermi’s notation, making the replace-
ment p →ρ1 in his formula for ρ(r).) To determine ρ0 and
ρ1, Fermi uses the average mass density of 5.5 g/cm3, and
a surface mass density of ρ(Re) = 3 g/cm3. This results in
ρ0 = 13 g/cm3, and ρ1Re = 10 g/cm3.
The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is now

2.4. THE MOMENTS OF INERTIA OF THE EARTH
21
The (atmospheric) pressure at the Earth’s surface can be ig-
nored compared to the pressure at the center. For numer-
ical evaluation, we use the SI unit of pascals (Pa) where
1 Pa = 1 N/m2. Fermi’s formula gives
p(0) = 3.11 × 108 kPa = 3.07 × 106 atm,
where we use 1 atm = 101,325 Pa.
The amount of infor-
mation on the interior of the Earth which is available at
present compared to Fermi’s time is truly enormous. Never-
theless, Fermi’s simple approach yields a number fairly close
to 3.6 × 108 kPa, the current estimate of the pressure at the
center of the Earth.
2.4
The Moments of Inertia of the Earth
Continuing, Fermi returns to the gravitational potential and
its connection with the moments of inertia of the Earth. In or-
der to make contact with modern results on the gravitational
potential, we brieﬂy give a more general discussion before re-
turning to Fermi’s notes. We start from a general expression
for the gravitational potential,
Vg(r) = −G
Z
d3r′ ρ(r′)
|r −r′|.
(2.39)
This is just Newton’s gravitational potential for a continuous
mass distribution, ρ(r). At any point outside of the Earth,
|r| > |r′|, and it is useful to expand the gravitational poten-
tial in inverse powers of r = |r|. Starting with the expansion
of the denominator in Eq. (2.39), we have

Inserting this expansion into Eq. (2.39), we may write Vg as
a series,
Vg(r) = V (0)

(2.44)
with repeated indices being summed in all cases. In general,
V (l)
g (r) varies with r as 1/rl+1. Choosing the origin at the
Earth’s center of mass, the l = 1 term vanishes, so the ﬁrst
nonvanishing term has l = 2. It can be expressed in terms of
the Earth’s moment of inertia.
The moment of inertia tensor is deﬁned as
Ijk =
Z
ρ(r′)(δjk(r′)2 −r′

k)d3r.
(2.45)
Comparing this integral to the one in V (2)
g
(r), the δjk(r′)2
term in Eq. (2.45) is absent in the V (2)
g
(r) integral. However,
since
(3rjrk −r2δjk)δjk = 0,
the same answer is obtained if we replace r′
jr′
k with r′

k −
(r′)2δjk in the integrand of V (2)

(r). After doing that, we have
V (2)
g
(r) = ( G

(2.46)

2.4. THE MOMENTS OF INERTIA OF THE EARTH
23
This formula makes it clear that V (2)
g
is determined by the
moment of inertia tensor. Although we will not consider l
values greater than 2, each term in V (l)
g
is determined by a
corresponding moment, involving an integral of the density ρ
weighted with l powers of r.
The situation considered by Fermi assumes the Earth is
azimuthally symmetric. For an azimuthally symmetric body,
the moment of inertia tensor is diagonal.
The polar axis
element I33 is conventionally denoted as C. The elements I11
and I22 are equal, and their common value is conventionally
denoted as A. The l = 2 term becomes

where the angle θ is measured with respect to the Earth’s

we have

The form of V (2)
g
given in Eqs. (2.47) and (2.48) is known as
McCullagh’s formula. Comparing to Eq. (2.9), we see that
J2 = C −A
Mea2 .
(2.49)
The values of C and A are well known (Yoder 1995) and can
be written as multiples of Mea2, where Me is the Earth’s
mass and a is the equatorial radius. Using that notation, the
values of A and C are
A = 0.3296108 Mea2, C = 0.3307007 Mea2.
(2.50)
For comparison, if the Earth were an axially symmetric ellip-
soid with a uniform mass density, we would obtain
Ael = 0.4000 Mea2, Cel = 0.3986 Mea2.
(2.51)

24
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
We see that both of these values are larger than the actual
values of A and C. This actual data is consistent with the
Earth having a nonuniform mass density, with higher density
closer to the center of the Earth. Using the known values
of A and C to compute J2 via Eq. (2.49) gives J2 = 1.089 ×
10−3, which is within 1% of the value determined by satellite
observations of the Earth’s gravitational potential.
The small inhomogeneities of the Earth’s mass distribution
show up in the higher l terms in the gravitational potential.
Modern measurements of the gravitational potential make use
of very accurate satellite data and are able to determine terms
up to l ∼40 in the gravitational potential (Nerem 1994).
2.5
Motions of the Earth’s Axis
In the next two sections, we treat material not explicitly cov-
ered in Fermi’s lecture notes: the precession of the equinoxes
and the search for Euler’s nutation. This material is of long-
term historical interest and ﬁts naturally onto subjects just
covered in preceding sections.
2.6
Equinoxes and Solstices
The existence of seasons certainly aﬀects the physics of the
Earth’s surface. The cause of seasons is that the Earth’s spin
axis is tilted at an angle with respect to the normal to the
ecliptic plane, the plane of the Earth’s orbit. The tilt an-
gle is θt = 24.44◦. The onsets of spring and fall occur at the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes, respectively. As the names
suggest, night and day have the same duration at an equinox.
Between the autumnal and vernal equinoxes there is the win-
ter solstice, when the the Earth’s axis points the maximal

2.7. PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES
25
amount away from the Sun. Similarly, the summer solstice
occurs between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when the
the Earth’s axis points the maximal amount toward the Sun.
The winter and summer solstices are often referred to as the
“shortest” and “longest” days of the year, the reference being
to the number of hours of sunlight in the Northern Hemi-
sphere.
To deﬁne the locations of equinoxes and solstices precisely,
let ˆn be a unit vector along the Earth’s spin axis, and let ˆnec
be the projection of that vector on the ecliptic plane. At a sol-
stice ˆnec is parallel or antiparallel to Rse, the vector from the
center of mass of the Sun to the center of mass of the Earth.
An equinox occurs when ˆnec is perpendicular to Rse. The
Earth’s position at the various seasons is shown schematically
in Fig. (2.1). The vertical arrows are along ˆe, the normal to
the ecliptic plane. The slanted arrows are pointed along the
Earth’s spin axis, ˆn. The ˆn vector rotates very slowly around
ˆe, the period of that rotation being many thousands of years.
Determining the period of that rotation is the subject of the
next section.
2.7
Precession of the Equinoxes
As discussed in previous sections, the Earth is slightly non-
spherical.
This means that in addition to attracting the
Earth, the Sun and Moon exert torques on the Earth. The
net torque causes the Earth’s angular momentum vector to
precess very slowly about the normal to the ecliptic plane.
The resulting slow motion along the Earth’s orbit is called
“precession of the equinoxes.” Of course the solstices change
location along the Earth’s orbit as well, but “precession of the
equinoxes” has been used for this precession. To visualize the
eﬀect of this precession, let Tex be its period. After passage

of times Tex/4 or 3Tex/4, equinoxes and solstices will be in-
terchanged, so March 21, instead of being the vernal equinox,
will be the winter or summer solstice. Likewise, after a time
of Tex/2, equinoxes remain equinoxes, but winter and sum-
mer solstices are interchanged. History recorded so far has
not been long enough to see these dramatic eﬀects, but the
small shifts in the dates of equinoxes and solstices have been
known from the time of the ancient Greeks.
To compute the precession rate, we turn to the angular
equation of motion
K = dL
dt ,
(2.52)
where the angular momentum of the Earth L, like the torque
K, is computed about the Earth’s center of mass. The angu-
lar momentum of the Earth is completely dominated by the
spinning of the Earth on its axis, since the shortest period in

2.7. PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES
27
the problem by far is the length of a single day, Tsol. Deﬁning
ωd ≡2π
Tsol
,
(2.53)
with negligible error we have
L = (Cωd)ˆn,
(2.54)
where C is the moment of inertia about the Earth’s spin axis.
It is useful to break L into two components, one along the
normal to the ecliptic plane, L∥, and the other perpendicular
to the normal, and hence in the ecliptic plane, L⊥. Their
magnitudes are given by
|L∥| = Cωd cos θt, |L⊥| = Cωd sin θt.
(2.55)
The solution of Eq. (2.52) becomes very simple if we av-
erage both sides over a period long compared to a year or a
month, but much shorter than the many thousands of years
involved in the period of the equinox precession. The time-
averaged torque ¯
K due to the Sun and the Moon is calculated
in Appendix B, Eq. (B.13). As shown there, the magnitude
of ¯
K is
| ¯
K| = 3
2 sin θt cos θt(C −A)(GMs
R3se
+ GMm
R3me
),
(2.56)
and it lies in the ecliptic plane, perpendicular to L⊥. The
torque has no eﬀect on L∥, which is therefore constant. The
torque rotates L⊥, leaving the magnitude of L⊥unchanged.
Let the angular frequency with which L⊥rotates be ωex. This
is the sought-for frequency of the equinox precession. We then
have
| d
dtL⊥| = ωex|L⊥| = ωex(Cωd sin θt).
(2.57)

28
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
The angular equation for |L⊥| is

K| = | d

Writing this out using Eqs. (2.56) and(2.57), we have

ωex = 3

(GMs

(2.60)
Using current values for the various parameters in Eq. (2.60),
we have
ωex = 8.26 × 10−12 rad/s,
(2.61)
corresponding to a period of 24,200 years, within a few per-
cent of the actual value of 25,800 years (Yoder 1995). The dis-
crepancy is largely accounted for by taking account of the ec-
centricities of the Earth and Moon’s orbits. It is worth point-
ing out that the sense of the precession about the normal to
the ecliptic plane is opposite to the sense of the Earth’s orbit
around the Sun. Viewing the ecliptic plane from above, the
Earth’s orbit around the Sun has a counterclockwise sense,
while the precession of the Earth’s axis about the ecliptic
plane normal is clockwise. The eﬀect is to make each season
appear a tiny bit sooner each year. Of course, once the period
of the precession of the equinoxes has elapsed, the Earth’s
axis has turned through a full 360◦and returns to its original
position. The precession of the equinoxes was observed over
2000 years ago.
The ﬁrst quantitative description is usually attributed to
Hipparchus in the ﬁrst century BCE but its explanation had
to wait until Newton’s great work on motion and gravity in
1687.

2.8. FREE ROTATIONAL MOTION
29
2.8
Nutation and Torque-Free Rotational Mo-
tion
In classical mechanics (Goldstein 1999; Landau and Lifshitz
1976), the term “nutation” refers to an oscillation in what is
usually known as the “second Euler angle.” This was θt in
Fig. (2.1), the angle between the Earth’s symmetry axis and
the normal to the ecliptic plane.
As the Earth undergoes
the precession of the equinoxes it also undergoes oscillation
or nutation in θt. One of the main contributors to nutation
of the Earth is the variation with time of the torque on the
Earth due to the Moon. This has a period of 18.6 years.
In astronomy, the term “nutation” is sometimes used in a
broader sense.
An interesting and easy to understand ex-
ample is a phenomenon which has various names, “Euler’s
nutation,” “free nutation,” and “polar motion.” Up to now,
we have assumed that the Earth’s axis of symmetry is coin-
cident with the direction of the Earth’s angular momentum
L. However, observations involving the ﬁxed stars show that
there is a tiny angle between the Earth’s symmetry axis and
its angular momentum vector, 9.7 × 10−7 rad. If two lines are
drawn through the center of mass of the Earth, one along
the symmetry axis and the other parallel to L, they cross
the Earth’s surface near the North Pole at points only ∼6 m
apart, certainly a small distance on an astronomical scale!
In this section, we will ignore external torques and treat the
angular momentum of the Earth as a constant vector. This
may seem paradoxical given that in the preceding section, the
precession of the equinoxes was explained as the direct result
of external torques, but this is not as strange as it seems at
ﬁrst glance. The torques which act on the Earth from other
planets or the Sun are very small, and to be observable, time
intervals of thousands of years are needed. In comparison, the

30
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
time intervals of interest in Euler’s nutation are very short
(300–400 days). Over such small time intervals, the torques
due to other planets only change the angular momentum by a
negligible amount and therefore it is an excellent approxima-
tion to treat the Earth’s angular momentum L as constant
over intervals of 300–400 days.
We will make use of two coordinate systems: one which
is space-ﬁxed (xyz) with L along the z axis and one which
is body-ﬁxed (123) with the 3 axis along the Earth’s axis of
symmetry. The space-ﬁxed system is generated from the one
used in Sec. (2.7) by a rotation which takes the normal to
the ecliptic plane to a direction parallel to L. The body-ﬁxed
coordinate system is a rotating coordinate system, rotating
at angular velocity ω, which in components is
ω = ω1ˆ1 + ω2ˆ2 + ω3ˆ3.
(2.62)
As explained in more detail in Sec. (6), in computing the time
rate of change of any vector, it is necessary to distinguish be-
tween the rate of change in the space-ﬁxed coordinate system
and that in the body-ﬁxed system. The relation between the
two is2
(dL
dt )sf = (dL
dt )bf + ω ∧L.
(2.63)
In the absence of torques, the angular momentum in the
space-ﬁxed system is conserved, so Eq. (2.63) is now
0 = (dL
dt )bf + ω ∧L.
(2.64)
Written out in components, Eq. (2.64) becomes a set of three
equations known as Euler’s equations. For the case of the
Earth with I3 = C and I1 = I2 = A, the angular momentum
is
L = Aω1ˆ1 + Aω2ˆ2 + Cω3ˆ3,
(2.65)
2For vectors A and B, A ∧B is the cross-product, equal to A × B.

2.8. FREE ROTATIONAL MOTION
31
and Euler’s equations are
0 = A ˙ω1 + ω2ω3(C −A)
(2.66)
0 = A ˙ω2 −ω1ω3(C −A)
0 = C ˙ω3.
From the third of Eqs. (2.66), we learn that ω3 is constant and
therefore so is L3 = Cω3. Deﬁning β as the angle between L
and the 3 axis, we have
L3 = L · ˆ3 = |L| cos β.
(2.67)
It follows that the angle between the angular momentum vec-
tor and the Earth’s axis of symmetry is constant. Fig. (2.2)
shows the angle β and indicates the sense of the Earth’s ro-
tation around its axis of symmetry. The setup is similar to
that shown in Fig. (2.1), except that here the z axis is along
L, rather than along the normal to the ecliptic plane.
Deﬁning the part of L which is perpendicular to the sym-
metry axis as L⊥= A(ω1ˆ1 + ω2ˆ2), the angular momentum
vector is L = L3ˆ3 + L⊥, and its square is
L · L = (L3)2 + L⊥· L⊥.
(2.68)
Eq. (2.68) shows that
L⊥· L⊥= A2(ω2
1 + ω2
2)
is constant, so ω2
1 + ω2
2 is also constant. To the Earth-ﬁxed
observer, the angular momentum appears to whirl around the
symmetry axis, L3 and |L⊥| remaining constant, with the
direction of L⊥moving in a circle. This is Euler’s nutation.
Deﬁning the corresponding frequency as
ωeu ≡ω3(C −A
A
),
(2.69)

32
CHAPTER 2. GRAVITY AND THE EARTH
the ﬁrst two Euler equations become
˙ω1 = −ωeu ω2
(2.70)
˙ω2 = +ωeu ω1.
To an Earth-ﬁxed observer, Eqs. (2.70) describe a counter-
clockwise motion of the angular momentum around the Earth’s
symmetry axis. (Note that for a prolate object with C < A,
the motion would be clockwise.)
To evaluate ωeu, the modern values of C and A were given
in Eq. (2.50). Using these we have
C −A
A
= 0.0033066 =
1
302.423.
(2.71)
The frequency ω3 is related to the length of a day by ω3 =
2π/Td, and likewise ωeu is related to its period by ωeu =
2π/Teu. Rewriting Eq. (2.69), we have
2π
Teu
= 2π
Td
(C −A
A
), or Teu = Td(
A
C −A).
(2.72)
Since Td is one day, using Eq. (2.71), we ﬁnd a period for
Euler’s nutation of
Teuler = 302.423 days.
(2.73)
An intensive search for a nutation with this period was carried
out in the late nineteenth century. The results were negative.
In 1891 Seth C. Chandler, an American amateur astronomer,
investigated a wider range of periods and discovered a nu-
tation with a period of approximately 434 days.
This has
come to be known as the “Chandler wobble.” A prime sus-
pect for the reason the period is so diﬀerent from the value
calculated by Euler is that the assumption that the Earth is
a rigid body has ﬁnally broken down. This is plausible, given

2.8. FREE ROTATIONAL MOTION
33
the presence of the oceans near the surface of the Earth, and
regions of the Earth’s interior which are liquid. However, this
explanation encounters its own problems, namely, if the pe-
riod of the Chandler wobble is largely due to the ﬂuidity, the
wobble itself should die away in less than 100 years. It re-
mains a fascinating problem still of interest today to explain
how a torque-free Earth and accompanying atmosphere can
maintain an enduring wobble with the correct frequency.
