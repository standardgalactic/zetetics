Abstract
Stochastic dynamical systems with continuous symmetries arise commonly in nature and
often give rise to coherent spatio-temporal patterns. However, because of their random loca-
tions, these patterns are not well captured by current order reduction techniques and a large
number of modes is typically necessary for an accurate solution. In this work, we introduce
a new methodology for eﬃcient order reduction of such systems by combining (i) the method
of slices [28, 13], a symmetry reduction tool, with (ii) any standard order reduction technique,
resulting in eﬃcient mixed symmetry-dimensionality reduction schemes. In particular, using the
Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) equations [30] in the second step, we obtain a novel nonlinear
Symmetry-reduced Dynamically Orthogonal (SDO) scheme. We demonstrate the performance
of the SDO scheme on stochastic solutions of the 1D Korteweg-de Vries and 2D Navier-Stokes
equations.

Introduction
Examples of physical systems that can be modeled as stochastic dynamical systems with contin-
uous symmetries abound in the world around us, whether it be pipe ﬂow [15], water waves [36],
ﬂame dynamics [27], or nonlinear optics [1], just to name a few. Stochasticity arises from unknown
parameters or initial conditions, while continuous symmetry manifests itself as translational and/or
rotational invariance due to speciﬁc geometry. Such systems are typically described by stochas-
tic partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) with complex nonlinear responses, which makes accurate
quantiﬁcation of their statistical behavior through direct Monte-Carlo simulations a challenge due
to the high computational costs involved.
Model order reduction aims at solving this issue by approximating the stochastic solution in
terms of a ﬁnite sum of deterministic spatial modes multiplied by stochastic scalar coeﬃcients,
motivated by the Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition. In this way, the computation of the stochastic
solution is reduced to the evolution of the coeﬃcients and/or the modes, leading to signiﬁcant
computational savings and, in some circumstances, to improved physical understanding of the un-
derlying dynamics. Naturally, there red diﬀerent possible ways to derive such reduced-order models
from the governing equations, and various dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed
over the years, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) combined with Galerkin
projection [3, 16], the Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion [35], or more recently the Dynamically
Orthogonal (DO) equations [30].

Stochastic dynamical systems with continuous symmetries often give rise to coherent spatio-
temporal patterns [9]. However, due to the fact that individual realizations are invariant along the
symmetry directions of the system, the precise location of these spatio-temporal patterns might be
subject to large stochastic variability and diﬀerent realizations might display similar structures at
completely diﬀerent spatial locations. As a result, reduced-order models relying on linear modal
decompositions will require a large number of spatial modes to adequately capture the spatio-
temporal dynamics of the stochastic solution, which is likely to oﬀset the computational gains.
This is because spatial shifts cannot be eﬃciently represented by a ﬁnite linear combination of
global spatial modes.
In parallel with dimensionality reduction methods, much work has been done over the last few
decades on symmetry reduction, which concerns the removal of continuous symmetries associated
with deterministic dynamical systems [8, 11, 28, 4, 33, 13, 20]. After symmetry reduction, the
dynamics of the original system along its symmetry directions (i.e. translations and/or rotations) is
factored out, so that the resulting symmetry-reduced state is left with non-trivial shape-changing
dynamics.
Coherent spatio-temporal patterns appearing in the symmetry-reduced solution will
therefore remain at the same spatial location while undergoing shape deformations.
In this way, the possibly low-rank structure of the symmetry-reduced state is preserved, which
is clearly advantageous for model order reduction purposes. [18, 14] ﬁrst combined such symmetry
reduction techniques with the POD to derive low-dimensional models for deterministic systems
governed by PDEs. Their model, however, only described the symmetry-reduced dynamics and no
attempt was made to recover the original system state. Such a closure was accomplished shortly
thereafter in the same context by [28] with a so-called “reconstruction equation” for the symmetry
coordinate, resulting in the ﬁrst dynamical order reduction framework to take advantage of the
continuous symmetries of a system. The same procedure was later adopted by [23] in the context of
parametric order reduction using reduced-basis methods. More generally, combinations of nonlinear
mappings with reduced-order models have been explored by several authors lately [17, 6, 7, 21, 22].
Similar ideas of reducing the symmetry before performing order reduction have also been ap-
plied to stochastic dynamical systems, but these recent studies focused on data reduction [34] or
inference [25]. Here, we introduce a new framework for eﬃcient dynamical model order reduction of
stochastic dynamical systems with continuous symmetries by combining symmetry reduction with
order reduction methods. As we will see, this approach naturally leads to novel nonlinear reduced-
order models that eﬃciently take advantage of the continuous symmetries of the system, leading
to much improved accuracy for a given number of modes. This methodology can be applied to
any dimensionality reduction method of choice provided the latter preserves the symmetry reduc-
tion properties, which is true for techniques like the POD or the DO equations. We will illustrate
our approach with the DO equations, which will result in a novel Symmetry-reduced Dynamically
Orthogonal (SDO) scheme.
The paper is structured as follows. The general symmetry-dimensionality reduction method-
ology as well as the derivation of the SDO scheme are presented in Section 2. The performance
of the SDO scheme is compared with the standard DO method on stochastic simulations of the
1D Korteweg-de Vries and 2D Navier-Stokes equations in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally,
conclusions follow in Section 5.

Blending symmetry reduction with dimensionality reduction
Let (Ω, B, P) be a probability space and ω ∈Ωindicate an elementary event. Denoting space
x ∈D ⊂Rn and time t, we consider the stochastic partial diﬀerential equation
∂u
∂t = F(u, t; ω),
(1)
where F is a (possibly stochastic and time-dependent) nonlinear diﬀerential operator and u(x, t; ω)
is a random vector ﬁeld that belongs to the Hilbert space H of continuous and square-integrable
functions with inner product
⟨u1, u2⟩=
Z
D
u1u∗
2 dx.
(2)
In this work, we are interested in dynamical systems that are symmetric under a group G of
continuous transformations, that is, the diﬀerential operator F satisﬁes the following equivariance
condition for any group element g ∈G
F(gu) = gF(u).
(3)
We will restrict ourselves to symmetry groups G that (i) are Lie groups, (ii) preserve inner products
and distances. Typically, G will consist of translations along diﬀerent direction and/or rotations
about diﬀerent axes. When the above relation (3) is satisﬁed, individual solutions u of the dynamical
system (1) are invariant under G, meaning that gu is also a solution for any g ∈G.
In this paper, we introduce a new framework for eﬃcient dimensionality reduction of such
systems with continuous symmetries. Our methodology comprises the two following steps:
1. In a ﬁrst step, we perform symmetry reduction of the dynamical system (1) using the
method of slices [28, 13]. In this framework, the original system state u is decomposed into
(i) a stochastic symmetry-reduced state ˆu, which is ﬁxed in the physical domain but captures
the intrinsic changes in shape of u, and (ii) a ﬁnite set of stochastic phase parameters φ that
track the motion of u along the symmetry directions of the system. The symmetry-reduced
state ˆu and phase parameters φ are deﬁned precisely in Section 2.1, and equations governing
their temporal evolution are presented in Section 2.2.
2. In a second step, we perform dimensionality reduction of the stochastic symmetry-reduced
state using any standard model order reduction method of choice. This order reduction step
is illustrated in Section 2.3 through the use of the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) equations
[30], which leads to a novel, nonlinear Symmetry-reduced Dynamically Orthogonal (SDO)
scheme.
In the following, we adopt a dynamical state-space approach where the system state u(t; ω) for
given time t and realization ω is represented by a single point in the inﬁnite dimensional state space
M of all possible solutions.
2.1
Method of slices
Let us ﬁrst consider a given deterministic state u, for instance a particular realization ω0 at a given
time t0 of (1). The application of the family of continuous transformations g ∈G to u gives rise
to a family of dynamically equivalent states gu called the group orbit of u, as illustrated in Figure
1(a). The goal of symmetry reduction is to reduce all these equivalent symmetry copies to a unique
representative symmetry-reduced state ˆu. For a given state u and its group orbit, the method of

Figure 1 – Symmetry reduction with the method of slices applied to a given state u, for instance a
particular realization ω0 at a given time t0 of a dynamical system with translational symmetry. (a)
Applying the family of continuous transformations g ∈G to u gives rise to a family of dynamically
equivalent states gu called the group orbit of u. (b) The method of slices deﬁnes ˆu by choosing the
point on the group orbit of u that minimizes the distance ||ˆu −ˆu′|| to a ﬁxed template state ˆu′.
Writing ˆu = g−1(φ)u, this minimum distance condition is achieved when the phase parameters φ
satisfy the slice condition (11).
slices deﬁnes ˆu by choosing the point on the group orbit of u that is closest to a ﬁxed template state
ˆu′, so that ˆu overlies as well as possible the template in physical space, as indicated in Figure 1(b).
Denoting with φ = φ1, ..., φN the N continuous scalar phase parameters of the transformation G
(for example the translations amounts and/or rotation angles along diﬀerent directions) and writing
u = g(φ)ˆu or equivalently ˆu = g−1(φ)u, this condition can be expressed in terms of φ as
min
φ ||g−1(φ)u −ˆu′||,
(4)
where we use the L2 norm ||u||2 = ⟨u, u⟩. As mentioned earlier, we only consider transformations
that do not aﬀect the inner product between diﬀerent states, i.e. ⟨gu1, gu2⟩= ⟨u1, u2⟩and ||gu|| =
||u||. Therefore, the above condition becomes
min
φ ||u −g(φ)ˆu′||,
(5)
from which we can deduce the extremum condition
∂
∂φa
||u −g(φ)ˆu′||2 =

⟨u, u⟩−2 ∂
∂φa
⟨u, g(φ)ˆu′⟩+
∂
∂φa
⟨g(φ)ˆu′, g(φ)ˆu′⟩= 0,
(6)
where a = 1, ..., N. Strictly speaking, one should also make sure that the second derivative with
respect to φa be positive in order to have a minimum. Using the distance-preserving property of
the transformation, the extremum condition leads to the following slice condition
⟨u, ta(g(φ)ˆu′)⟩= 0,
(7)
4

where ta(g(φ)ˆu′) is the tangent to the group orbit at g(φ)ˆu′ in direction φa
ta(g(φ)ˆu′) = ∂g(φ)ˆu′
∂φa
= lim
δφa→0
g(φ + δφa)ˆu′ −g(φ)ˆu′
δφa
.
(8)
Since G is a Lie group, we have g(φ + δφa)ˆu′ = g(φ)g(δφa)ˆu′, thus we can factor out the group
action g(φ) from the above expression to obtain the relation
ta(g(φ)ˆu′) = g(φ)ta(ˆu′),
(9)
where ta(ˆu′) is the group orbit tangent at the ﬁxed template ˆu′ in direction φa
ta(ˆu′) = lim
δφa→0
g(δφa)ˆu′ −ˆu′
δφa
.
(10)
As a result, we may now use the distance-preserving property of g to rewrite the slice condition (7)
in terms of the symmetry-reduced state ˆu
⟨u, g(φ)t′
a⟩= 0
⇔
⟨ˆu, t′
a⟩= 0,
(11)
where we have denoted the ﬁxed template tangent t′
a = ta(ˆu′). Given a state u and template ˆu′,
the ﬁrst equality in the above slice condition gives the phase parameters φ such that the distance
between the symmetry-reduced state ˆu = g−1(φ)u and the template ˆu′ is minimized. The second
equality can be interpreted as an orthogonality condition which states that the symmetry-reduced
state ˆu always lies within a hyperplane normal to the N group orbit tangents t′
a at the template
ˆu′. This ﬁxed hyperplane thus deﬁnes a slice through the full state space containing all symmetry-
reduced states and called the symmetry-reduced state space, see Figure 2.
2.2
Dynamics within the symmetry-reduced state space
Consider now that u(t; ω) is stochastic and evolves under the governing equation (1), as illustrated
in Figure 2. The evolution of u(t; ω) in the full state space will correspond a set of stochastic
and time-dependent phase parameters φ(t; ω) and a stochastic symmetry-reduced state ˆu(t; ω) =
g−1(φ(t; ω))u(t; ω) evolving in the symmetry-reduced state space in such a way that the slice
condition (11) is satisﬁed at all times and for all realizations.
In other words, the symmetry-
reduced state is ﬁxed to the template in physical space and captures the shape deformations of
u(t; ω), while the phase parameters track the motion of u(t; ω) along the symmetry directions of
the system. In order to ﬁnd the evolution equations for the symmetry-reduced state ˆu and the
phase parameters φ, we ﬁrst plug the relation u = g(φ)ˆu into the governing equations
˙φa
∂g(φ)ˆu
∂φa
+ g(φ)∂ˆu
∂t = F(g(φ)ˆu),
(12)
where repeated indices indicate summation. As was done in (8), we next express the term ∂g(φ)ˆu/∂φa
as
∂g(φ)ˆu
∂φa
= ta(g(φ)ˆu) = g(φ)ta(ˆu),
(13)
where ta(ˆu) is the group orbit tangent of the time-dependent state ˆu in direction φa
ta(ˆu) = lim
δφa→0
g(δφa)ˆu −ˆu

Figure 2 – Symmetry reduction with the method of slices applied to a stochastic dynamical system,
shown here for the time trajectory of a particular realization u(t) = u(t; ω0) with corresponding
symmetry-reduced state ˆu(t) = ˆu(t; ω0) and phase parameters φ(t) = φ(t; ω0).
While u(t) is
evolving in the full state space under the governing equation (1), ˆu(t) and φ(t) evolve under
equations (15) and (17) in such a way that the slice condition (11) is satisﬁed at all times t.
As a result, the trajectory of ˆu(t) remains conﬁned to the symmetry-reduced state space passing
through the ﬁxed template ˆu′ and orthogonal to its group orbit tangents t′
a = ta(ˆu′). One can
always reconstruct the full stochastic state from the symmetry-reduced stochastic dynamics as
u(t; ω) = g(φ(t; ω))ˆu(t; ω).
Finally, we make use of the equivariance condition (3) to obtain the following evolution equation
for the symmetry-reduced state
∂ˆu
∂t = F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu).
(15)
It remains to ﬁnd evolution equations for the phase parameters φ, which is achieved by substituting
the above equation into the time derivative of the slice condition (11)
⟨∂ˆu
∂t , t′
a⟩= ⟨F(ˆu), t′
a⟩−˙φb ⟨tb(ˆu), t′
a⟩= 0.
(16)
The above equation can be interpreted as an orthogonality condition that constrains the dynamics
of ˆu to remain conﬁned within the symmetry-reduced state space deﬁned by the ﬁxed template ˆu′.
Introducing the stochastic time-dependent matrix {T}ab = ⟨tb(ˆu), t′
a⟩and vector {f}a = ⟨F(ˆu), t′
a⟩,
one ﬁnally gets the following matrix inverse problem for the phase velocity
˙φ = T−1f.
(17)
Together, equations (15) and (17) govern the evolution of the stochastic symmetry-reduced state
ˆu(t; ω) and the phase parameters φ(t; ω) (see also [10] in the deterministic context). In this way,
the dynamics of u(t; ω) has been separated into shape deformations, reproduced by ˆu(t; ω) which is
ﬁxed in physical space, and motion along the symmetry directions of the system, tracked by φ(t; ω).
From these two quantities, the evolution of the system in the full state space can be reconstructed
exactly as u(t; ω) = g(φ(t; ω))ˆu(t; ω), hence no information has been lost so far.
Before moving on to the next step, we note that the choice of template can aﬀect the symmetry
reduction procedure in two distinct ways. For a given state u, diﬀerent templates will naturally lead

Each realization u(x, t; ω) of the original stochastic state is reduced
to the symmetry-reduced realization ˆu(x, t; ω) = g−1(φ(t; ω))u(x, t; ω) that minimizes the distance
||ˆu(x, t; ω)−ˆu′(x)||, where ˆu′(x) is a ﬁxed template. As a result, the symmetry-reduced realizations
ˆu(x, t; ω) can be approximated much better by low-dimensional models that rely on linear modal
decompositions than their full state space counterparts u(x, t; ω).
to diﬀerent optimal values of φ for which the symmetry-reduced state ˆu = g−1(φ)u is closest to the
template ˆu′. Nevertheless, the full state reconstructed from the solution to equations (15) and (17)
will be independent of the template. The second and potentially more worrisome eﬀect concerns
the conditioning of the matrix T, or worse, the possibility of having singularities in equation (17)
whenever the determinant of T vanishes. This is a consequence of the fact that there exist states
u for which a solution to the minimization problem (4), or equivalently the slice condition (11),
ceases to exist (a trivial exemple being the spatially constant state). The number and nature of
such problematic states depend on the template function and reﬂect the ﬁnite extent of validity of
the symmetry-reduced state space deﬁned by a given template. Therefore, the well-posedness of
(17) and the likelihood of encountering singularities are critically tied to the choice of template.
We will see in Sections 3.3 and 4.3 that there exist clever choices which almost entirely alleviate
this issue.
2.3
Order reduction in the symmetry-reduced state space
We now turn to the second step of our methodology, which consists in applying standard order
reduction methods directly to the dynamics of ˆu in the symmetry-reduced space, governed by
equations (15) and (17). Because the symmetry-reduced stochastic state is deﬁned in such a way
that the distance ||ˆu(x, t; ω)−ˆu′(x)|| is minimized at all times and for all realizations, the symmetry-
reduced realizations ˆu(x, t; ω) will be grouped together in physical space, as illustrated in Figure 3.
This property is very appealing for low-dimensional models that rely on linear modal decompositions
since it implies that the symmetry-reduced realizations ˆu(x, t; ω) can be approximated much better
by such ﬁnite-dimensional modal decompositions than their full state space counterparts u(x, t; ω).
This is inherently connected to the notion of Kolmogorov n-width from approximation theory
[19, 24], and we may say that the symmetry-reduced realizations have much lower n-width than
their full state space counterparts [23, 6].
Here, as an illustration, we perform dimensionality reduction using the DO framework [30]
because of its inherent and desirable ability to deal with strongly transient stochastic responses.
Moreover, by considering the DO equations as a computational method for evolving a low-rank
matrix representation of the discretized solution, [12] recently showed that DO gives the best
7

possible instantaneous approximation amongst reduced-order models relying on a linear modal
decomposition. In general, we note that when choosing an order reduction method, one needs
to make sure that the order reduction step preserves the symmetry reduction step, that is, the
dynamics of the low-dimensional solution remain conﬁned to the symmetry-reduced state space.
As discussed above, we apply the DO equations directly to the symmetry-reduced state ˆu instead
of the original state u, resulting in a new order reduction framework that we call the Symmetry-
reduced Dynamically Orthogonal (SDO) equations. Following the standard DO methodology, the
stochastic symmetry-reduced state is decomposed into a mean component, and a stochastic part
that is projected to a low-dimensional subspace of order s through the following ﬁnite-dimensional
expansion
ˆu(x, t; ω) = ¯u(x, t) + Yi(t; ω)ˆui(x, t),
i = 1, ..., s,
(18)
where ¯u(x, t) is the mean of the symmetry-reduced state, ˆui(x, t) are time-dependent orthonormal
modes that capture the principal directions of variance of the symmetry-reduced state, and Yi(t; ω)
are time-dependent stochastic coeﬃcients that characterize the symmetry-reduced stochastic state
within this subspace. The redundancy arising from the dependence in time of both the modes and
stochastic coeﬃcients is overcome through the DO condition
⟨∂ˆui
∂t , ˆuj⟩= 0,
i, j = 1, ..., s,
(19)
which requires that the time variation of the stochastic subspace be orthogonal to itself. Inserting
the DO representation (18) into equation (15) governing the evolution of ˆu(x, t; ω) in the symmetry-
reduced state space and using the DO condition (19), one obtains, together with equation (17) for
the phase parameters φ(t; ω), an explicit set of evolution equations for all unknown quantities. We
have the following deterministic PDE for the mean ﬁeld
∂¯u
∂t = E[F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu)],
(20)
the following stochastic ODEs for the stochastic coeﬃcients
dYi
dt = ⟨F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu) −E[F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu)], ˆui⟩,
(21)
and the following deterministic PDEs for the modes
∂ˆui
∂t = ˆHi −⟨ˆHi, ˆuj⟩ˆuj,
(22)
where the deterministic ﬁelds ˆHi are deﬁned as
ˆHi = E[Yk(F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu))] C−1
ik ,
(23)
where Cij = E[YiYj] is the covariance matrix. The continuous phase parameters φ(t; ω) are evolved
according to the stochastic equation (17)
˙φ = T−1f,
(24)
where {T}ab = ⟨tb(ˆu), t′
a⟩and {f}a = ⟨F(ˆu), t′
a⟩. Altogether, equations (20), (21), (22) and (24)
constitute the SDO scheme. They entirely specify the time evolution of the symmetry-reduced
state ˆu(x, t; ω) and the phase parameters φ(t; ω). In Appendix A, we show that the dynamics of
8

the reduced-order solution (18) remain conﬁned to the symmetry-reduced state space. Finally, the
full state is easily recovered through the group transformation
u(x, t; ω) = g(φ(t; ω))ˆu(x, t; ω) = g(φ(t; ω))¯u(x, t) + Yi(t; ω)g(φ(t; ω))ˆui(x, t).
(25)
The above equation shows that the SDO framework can be interpreted as a nonlinear extension of
the usual DO methodology, wherein the mean and modes are allowed further degrees of freedom
through the stochastic and time-dependent group transformation g(φ(t; ω)) along the symmetry
directions G of the system. In this sense, it is naturally expected that SDO performs as well or
better than DO, which we will see in the following sections where we apply both schemes to concrete
one and two-dimensional examples.

Application to the KdV equation
We ﬁrst illustrate our approach with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation that describes the
evolution of weakly nonlinear waves on shallow water surfaces
∂u
∂t + u∂u
∂x + µ∂3u
∂x3 = 0,
(26)
where u(x, t) is the surface elevation, x ∈[0, L] the space variable and t the time. Stochasticity
will be introduced through the initial conditions. The boundary conditions are periodic so that the
KdV equation is equivariant under the symmetry group of continuous translations, G = SO(2)x.
The associated shift operator g ∈G writes
g(c)u(x) = u(x −c),
(27)
where the continuous phase parameter c represents the shift amount. The tangent to the group
orbit at an arbitrary state u is then given by
t(u) = lim
δc→0
g(δc)u −u
δc
= −∂u
∂x.
(28)
3.1
Dynamics within the symmetry-reduced state space
As described in Section 2.2, we now pick a ﬁxed template ˆu′(x) and we consider the evolution
of the symmetry-reduced stochastic state ˆu(x, t; ω) = g−1(c(t; ω))u(x, t; ω) such that the distance
||ˆu(x, t; ω) −ˆu′(x)|| between the reduced state and the template is minimized at all times t and for
all realizations ω. In the case of the KdV equation subject to the symmetry group G, the dynamical
equations (15) for ˆu in the symmetry-reduced state space become
∂ˆu
∂t = F(ˆu) + ˙c ∂ˆu
∂x,
(29)
where F(u) is the diﬀerential operator corresponding to the KdV equation in the full state space
F(u) = −u∂u
∂x −µ∂3u
∂x3 ,
(30)
and the stochastic diﬀerential equation (17) for the shift amount c(t; ω) writes
˙c = ⟨F(ˆu), t′⟩
⟨t(ˆu), t′⟩,
(31)
where t′ = t(ˆu′) is the group orbit tangent to the ﬁxed template ˆu′.

3.2
Order reduction in the symmetry-reduced state space
In order to formulate the reduced-order SDO equations, let us ﬁrst approximate the symmetry-
reduced stochastic state as a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion
ˆu(x, t; ω) = ¯u(x, t) + Yi(t; ω)ˆui(x, t),
i = 1, ..., s,
(32)
where ¯u and ˆui are respectively the symmetry-reduced mean and modes and Yi are the stochastic
coeﬃcients of the ﬁnite-dimensional expansion. Next, we insert the above representation into the
RHS of the evolution equation (29) for the symmetry-reduced state
F(ˆu) + ˙c ∂ˆu
∂x = F0 + Yi Fi + YiYj Fij + ˙c ∂¯u
∂x + ˙c Yi
∂ˆui
∂x ,
(33)
where F0, Fi, and Fij are deterministic ﬁelds given by
F0 = −¯u∂¯u
∂x −µ∂3¯u
∂x3 ,
(34a)
Fi = −¯u∂ˆui
∂x −ˆui
∂¯u
∂x −µ∂3ˆui
∂x3 ,
(34b)
Fij = −ˆui
∂ˆuj
∂x .
(34c)
Now, we substitute the expanded RHS operator (33) into the SDO equations (20), (21) and (22)
to ﬁnd the following evolution equation for the mean
∂¯u
∂t = F0 + CijFij + E[˙c]∂¯u
∂x + E[˙cYi]∂ˆui
∂x .
(35)
We then have the following evolution equation for the stochastic coeﬃcients
dYi
dt = Ym ⟨Fm, ˆui⟩+ (YmYn −Cmn)⟨Fmn, ˆui⟩
(36)
+ (˙c −E[˙c])⟨∂¯u
∂x, ˆui⟩+ (˙cYm −E[˙cYm])⟨∂ˆum
∂x , ˆui⟩,
(37)
while the modes are governed by the following equation
∂ˆui
∂t = ˆHi −⟨ˆHi, ˆuj⟩ˆuj,
(38)
where the deterministic ﬁelds ˆHi are deﬁned as
ˆHi = Fi + MmnkC−1
ik Fmn + C−1
ik E[˙cYk]∂¯u
∂x + C−1
ik E[˙cYkYm]∂ˆum
∂x ,
(39)
with Mmnk = E[YmYnYk] the matrix of third-order moments. Finally, the time evolution of the
shift amount is given by the stochastic equation (31), which can be expanded as
˙c = ⟨F0, t′⟩+ Yi⟨Fi, t′⟩+ YiYj⟨Fij, t′⟩
⟨t(¯u), t′⟩+ Yi⟨t(ˆui), t′⟩
.
(40)
At any given time, the full stochastic state can then be reconstructed from the reduced-order quan-
tities and the time-integrated stochastic shift amount through the following group transformation
u(x, t; ω) = g(c(t; ω))ˆu(x, t; ω) = ¯u(x −c(t; ω), t) + Yi(t; ω)ˆui(x −c(t; ω), t).

3.3
Choice of the template
The SDO equations become singular as the denominator in (40) vanishes. A critical issue is there-
fore to choose a template which ensures that the quantity ⟨t(ˆu), t′⟩always remains nonzero, for
all realizations and at all times. For deterministic scalar systems equivariant under continuous
translations, this issue was elegantly addressed by [5] with what they called the ﬁrst Fourier mode
slice, a particular choice of template for which the slice condition (7) is equivalent to setting the
phase of the ﬁrst Fourier mode of the symmetry-reduced state ˆu to a ﬁxed value. In this way, ˆu is
pinned at a speciﬁc location in physical space and the method is expected to work as long as the
amplitude of the ﬁrst Fourier mode of u does not vanish.
Consider an arbitrary deterministic state u and its symmetry-reduced counterpart ˆu = g−1(c)u,
where the translation amount c is such that the slice condition ⟨ˆu, t(ˆu′)⟩= 0 is satisﬁed given a
ﬁxed template function ˆu′. Introducing the Fourier series decomposition
u(x) =
X
k∈Z
˜u(k)ei2πkx/L,
(42)
where ˜u(k), k ∈Z are the Fourier coeﬃcients of u, the symmetry-reduced state is expressed as
ˆu(x) = u(x + c) =
X
k∈Z
|˜u(k)|ei(arg ˜u(k)+2πkc/L)ei2πkx/L,
(43)
where |˜u(k)| and arg ˜u(k) are respectively the modulus and phase angle of ˜u(k). The above relation
shows that the Fourier coeﬃcients of ˆu are those of u rotated by an amount equal to 2πkc/L. In
the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice method, the c is chosen such that the phase angle of the ﬁrst Fourier
mode of ˆu is always a ﬁxed value.
Here, we choose this value to be π so that the symmetry-
reduced state appears centered in the domain. This implies arg ˜u(1) + 2πc/L = π or equivalently
c = −arg ˜u(1)L/2π + L/2. As shown in Appendix B, this choice of c corresponds to the following
template function
ˆu′ = cos 2πx
L .
(44)
The ﬁrst Fourier mode slice can be readily applied to our stochastic SDO equations by choosing
(44) as our template function. In this way, all symmetry-reduced realizations ˆu(x, t; ω) have their
ﬁrst Fourier mode phase ﬁxed to π and are eﬀectively pinned at the center of the physical domain.
Furthermore, equation (40) is well posed as long as the amplitude of the ﬁrst Fourier mode of
u(x, t; ω) remains ﬁnite for all realizations and at all times. This is always true unless one of the
realizations has spatial periodicity equal to half that of the domain, which is unlikely to happen in
practice.
3.4
Initialization of the SDO quantities
Given an initial ensemble of realizations u0(x; ω), the initial conditions for the quantities involved
in the SDO computation are found by a two-step process, where (i) the symmetry-reduced version
ˆu0(x; ω) of each realization is calculated, leading to the initial stochastic translation amount c0(ω),
and (ii) the initial symmetry-reduced mean ¯u0(x), modes ˆui0(x) and stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω)
are obtained from a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion of ˆu0(x; ω).
Step 1. First, the symmetry-reduced counterparts ˆu0(x; ω) = g−1(c0(ω))u0(x; ω) of the initial
realizations u0(x; ω) are calculated from
ˆu0(x; ω) = u0(x + c0(ω); ω) =
X
k∈Z
˜u0(k; ω)ei2πkc0(ω)/Lei2πkx/L,
(45)
11

where ˜u0(k; ω) are the Fourier coeﬃcients associated to each realization u0(x; ω). To bring the
symmetry-reduced state ˆu0(x; ω) to the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice, the initial stochastic translation
amount c0(ω) is chosen such that the phase angle of the ﬁrst Fourier mode of ˆu0(x; ω) is equal to
π for all realizations ω, that is c0(ω) = −arg ˜u0(1; ω)L/2π + L/2.
Step 2. The initial symmetry-reduced realizations ˆu0(x; ω) can then be approximated through
a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion, giving a set of symmetry-reduced modes and stochastic
coeﬃcients from which the SDO modes and coeﬃcients can be initialized. Deﬁning ﬁrst the initial
symmetry-reduced mean ¯u0(x) = E[ˆu0(x; ω)], the initial symmetry-reduced orthonormal modes
ˆui0(x) are then given by the s most energetic eigenfunctions of the following eigenvalue problem
Z L
0
R(x, y)ˆui0(x) dx = λiˆui0(y),
y ∈[0, L],
i = 1, ..., s,
(46)
where the correlation operator R(x, y) = E[(ˆu0(x; ω) −¯u0(x))(ˆu0(y; ω) −¯u0(y))].
Finally, the
associated initial stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω) are obtained by projection of the initial symmetry-
reduced realizations to the symmetry-reduced modes
Yi0(ω) = ⟨ˆu0(x; ω) −¯u0(x), ˆui0(x)⟩,
i = 1, ..., s.
(47)
Note that s not only represents the number of modes and stochastic coeﬃcients of the SDO
scheme, but also sets the tolerance on the truncated Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (46) of the
initial condition. Therefore, its value should be chosen so that both (i) the stochastic symmetry-
reduced initial condition ˆu0(x; ω) and (ii) the subsequent time-evolving stochastic solution ˆu(x, t; ω)
are suﬃciently well approximated. The accuracy of the initial condition can be monitored by the
decay of the eigenvalues λi of the truncated Karhunen-Loeve decomposition (46), which indicate
the amount of variance in ˆu0(x; ω) contained along each of the corresponding eigendirections ˆui0(x).
Similarly, one can get a rough idea on the accuracy of the stochastic solution by looking at the
evolution of the variance in the stochastic coeﬃcients associated with the last few modes. A rigorous
approach, however, requires knowledge of the exact solution (either from Monte-Carlo simulations
or analytical arguments).
In section 3.6, we will compare numerical results from the SDO framework with those from
a DO computation.
In the case of DO, the various quantities are initialized following Step 2
directly, i.e. the initial mean ¯u0(x), modes ui0(x) and stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω) are deﬁned from
a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion of the initial full state-space realizations u0(x; ω).
3.5
Numerical scheme
The SDO equations for the mean and the modes are implemented using a standard pseudo-spectral
method in space with 3/2 antialiasing and a semi-implicit Euler scheme in time, where the third-
order derivatives are treated implicitly and the nonlinear terms are treated explicitly. The stochastic
coeﬃcients and translation amount are integrated in time with respectively a 4th-order Runge-
Kutta and a 2-step Adams-Bashforth scheme, both using a particle method. Note that setting the
stochastic translation amount to zero in the SDO equations readily yields the standard DO scheme.
For both SDO and DO, we use L = 2π, µ = 5 · 10−4, 512 Fourier modes, ∆t = 10−4 and 1000
Monte-Carlo particles.

where a(ω) ∼U(0.1, 0.5) is a random variable that aﬀects both the amplitude and the width of
the hyperbolic secant proﬁle. Each realization ω deﬁned by the above initial condition is an exact
soliton solution of the KdV equation with propagation velocity a(ω), which makes this problem
challenging for classical order reduction methods as a large number of modes eventually becomes
necessary to reproduce faithfully the spatial dispersion of all realisations. The SDO scheme, on
the other hand, should not suﬀer from such issues since the shift amount c(t; ω) takes care of the
spatial translation of the realizations, leaving the symmetry-reduced mean and modes to account
for a change in shape that is here nonexistent since the solution consists of solitons. Hence, we use
just one mode for the SDO computation, which we initialize according to the procedure described
in Section 3.4. For comparison purposes, we also perform a regular DO simulation of the same
problem, but using 10 modes instead.
The ﬁrst two rows in Figure 4 show the symmetry-reduced mean ¯u(x, t) and the single symmetry-
reduced mode ˆu1(x, t) of the SDO solution at ﬁnal time t = 3 (left), and their spatio-temporal
evolution (right).
As expected, both the symmetry-reduced mean and mode are steady, which
reﬂects the fact that the dynamics of the individual solitons purely consist of translation, which

is entirely absorbed in the stochastic shift amount c(t; ω). The original stochastic state u(x, t; ω)
can be reconstructed from the SDO quantities through the group transformation (41), and we
display in the last row of Figure 4 ten full state-space realizations at ﬁnal time t = 3 (left) and the
spatio-temporal evolution of one of them (right). Each individual soliton realization maintains its
initial shape while propagating at a constant amplitude-dependent velocity, which is expected but
nonetheless remarkable considering that the SDO computation uses just one single mode.
To put these results into context, Figure 5 shows the mean ¯u(x, t), the ﬁrst two modes ui(x, t)
and ten full state-space realizations u(x, t; ω) of the corresponding DO simulation. Contrary to the
SDO simulation, the DO realizations at ﬁnal time have not preserved their initial shape although
the DO simulation is using ten times as many modes. This is because the DO mean and modes
need to account for the translation at random speed of the stochastic soliton, hence they become
dispersed over space as time progresses.
This diﬀerence in the amount of stochasticity accounted for by the modes is clearly observed in

of the SDO mode, represented by the variance of the corresponding stochastic coeﬃcient, remains
equal to its initial value while that of the DO modes grows drastically over time. Thus, the DO
scheme would need a much larger number of modes to achieve a comparable level of accuracy to
the SDO simulation, which proves the better eﬃciency of SDO.

Application to the Navier-Stokes equations
In this section, we illustrate our approach with the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
∂u
∂t + u · ∇u = −∇p + 1
Re∆u,
(49a)
∇· u = 0,
(49b)
written in nondimensional variables, with Re the Reynolds number, and deﬁned on the spatial
domain x ∈D = [0, L1] × [0, L2] with periodic boundary conditions. The Navier-Stokes equations
are equivariant under translations, rotations and inversion about the origin. Focusing on the group
of continuous translations along the two spatial directions G = SO(2)x1 × SO(2)x2, we deﬁne the
shift operator g ∈G as
g(c)u(x) = u(x −c),
(50)
where the continuous phase parameter c = (c1, c2)T represents the shift amounts in the x1 and x2
directions. The group orbit gu at an arbitrary state u thus possesses two tangents, one for each
direction x1 and x2, given by

Dynamics within the symmetry-reduced state space
As before, we now pick a ﬁxed template ˆu′(x) and we consider the evolution of the symmetry-
reduced state ˆu(x, t; ω) = g−1(c(t; ω))u(x, t; ω) such that the distance ||ˆu(x, t; ω) −ˆu′(x)|| between
15

the reduced state and the template is minimized at all times t and for all realizations ω. In the case
of the Navier-Stokes equations subject to the symmetry group G, the dynamical equations (15) for
ˆu in the symmetry-reduced state space become
∂ˆu
∂t = F(ˆu) + ˙c · ∇ˆu,
(52)
where the full state space nonlinear diﬀerential operator F has the form
F(ˆu) = −∇p + 1
Re∆ˆu −ˆu · ∇ˆu,
(53)
with p acting as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce ∇· ˆu = 0 since the divergence-free condition on u
implies that ˆu is also divergence-free. Finally, the stochastic diﬀerential equation (17) for the shift
amount c(t; ω) writes

Order reduction in the symmetry-reduced state space
In order to formulate the reduced-order SDO equations, let us ﬁrst approximate the symmetry-
reduced stochastic state as a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion
ˆu(x, t; ω) = ¯u(x, t) + Yi(t; ω)ˆui(x, t),
i = 1, ..., s,
(55)
where ¯u and ˆui are respectively the symmetry-reduced mean and modes and Yi are the stochastic
coeﬃcients of the ﬁnite-dimensional expansion. Next, we insert the above representation into the
RHS of the evolution equation (52) for the symmetry-reduced state to obtain
F(ˆu) + ˙c · ∇ˆu = −∇p + F0 + Yi Fi + YiYj Fij + ˙c · ∇¯u + ˙cYi · ∇ˆui,
(56)
where F0, Fi and Fij are deterministic ﬁelds given by
F0 = 1
Re∆¯u −¯u · ∇¯u,
(57a)
Fi = 1
Re∆ˆui −ˆui · ∇¯u −¯u · ∇ˆui,
(57b)
Fij = −ˆui · ∇ˆuj.
(57c)
The stochastic pressure p ensures that ˆu is divergence-free, hence by setting the divergence of the
expanded RHS operator (56) to zero (following [31]), one ﬁnds that
p = p0 + Yi pi + YiYj pij,
(58)
where ∆p0 = ∇· F0, ∆pi = ∇· Fi and ∆pij = ∇· Fij are deterministic pressure ﬁelds. Now, we
insert the expanded RHS operator (56) governing the evolution of the symmetry-reduced state ˆu
into the SDO equations (20), (21) and (22) to ﬁnd the following evolution equation for the mean
∂¯u
∂t = −∇p0 + F0 + Cij(−∇pij + Fij) + E[˙c] · ∇¯u + E[˙cYi] · ∇ˆui.
(59)
We then have the following evolution equation for the stochastic coeﬃcients
dYi
dt = Ym⟨−∇pm + Fm, ˆui⟩+ (YmYn −Cmn)⟨−∇pmn + Fmn, ˆui⟩
16

+ (˙c −E[˙c]) · ⟨∇¯u, ˆui⟩+ (˙cYm −E[˙cYm]) · ⟨∇ˆum, ˆui⟩,
(60)
where we have deﬁned ⟨∇¯u, ˆui⟩= (⟨∂x1 ¯u, ˆui⟩, ⟨∂x2 ¯u, ˆui⟩)T, and similarly ⟨∇ˆum, ˆui⟩= (⟨∂x1 ˆum, ˆui⟩, ⟨∂x2 ˆum, ˆui⟩)T.
The modes are governed by the following equation
∂ˆui
∂t = ˆHi −⟨ˆHi, ˆuj⟩ˆuj,
(61)
where the deterministic ﬁelds ˆHi are deﬁned as
ˆHi = −∇pi + Fi + MkmnC−1
ik (−∇pmn + Fmn)
+ C−1
ik E[˙cYk] · ∇¯u + C−1
ik E[˙cYkYm] · ∇ˆum.
(62)
with Mkmn = E[YkYmYn] the matrix of third-order moments. Finally, the time evolution of the shift
amount ˙c is given by the stochastic linear system (54) where the stochastic matrix T and vector f
can be expanded in functions of Yi and YiYj with i, j = 1, ..., s using that ta(ˆu) = ta(¯u) + Yita(ˆui),
a = 1, 2 and F(ˆu) = −∇p0 + F0 + Yi (−∇pi + Fi) + YiYj (−∇pij + Fij).
At any given time, the full stochastic state can be reconstructed from the reduced-order quan-
tities and the time-integrated stochastic shift amount through the group transformation
u(x, t; ω) = g(c(t; ω))ˆu(x, t; ω) = ¯u(x −c(t; ω), t) + Yi(t; ω)ˆui(x −c(t; ω), t; ω).
(63)
4.3
Choice of the template
The ﬁrst Fourier mode slice is unambiguously deﬁned for scalar ﬁelds since there is a unique Fourier
coeﬃcient with wavenumber one which deﬁnes the symmetry-reduced state. However, ambiguity
arises when one considers vector ﬁelds with multiples components and therefore multiple Fourier
coeﬃcients of wavenumber one. Nevertheless, we show here that for the particular case of ﬂuid
ﬂow in two dimensions, one can overcome this issue by deﬁning the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice based
on the scalar vorticity ﬁeld instead.
Let us introduce an arbitrary deterministic two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld u(x) = (u1(x1, x2), u2(x2, x2))T
and its symmetry-reduced counterpart ˆu = g−1(c)u, where c = (c1, c2)T is such that both slice con-
ditions ⟨ˆu, t1(ˆu′)⟩= 0 and ⟨ˆu, t2(ˆu′)⟩= 0 are satisﬁed given a ﬁxed template function ˆu′. Consider
now the scalar vorticity ﬁeld deﬁned by ω = ∂x1u2 −∂x2u1. Its Fourier series is
ω(x) =
X
k1,k2∈Z
˜ω(k1, k2)ei2π(k1x1/L1+k2x2/L2),
(64)
where ˜ω = ik1˜u2 −ik2˜u1, with ˜u1 and ˜u2 the Fourier coeﬃcients of u1 and u2 respectively. The
corresponding symmetry-reduced vorticity ﬁeld is expressed as
ˆω(x) = ω(x + c)
=
X
k1,k2∈Z
|˜ω(k1, k2)|ei(arg ˜ω(k1,k2)+2π(k1c1/L1+k2c2/L2))ei2π(k1x1/L1+k2x2/L2),
(65)
where |˜ω(k1, k2)| and arg ˜ω(k1, k2) are respectively the modulus and phase angle of ˜ω. Similar to
the one-dimensional case, the above relation shows that the Fourier coeﬃcients of ˆω are those of ω
rotated by an amount equal to 2π(k1c1/L1 + k2c2/L2). Therefore we can deﬁne the ﬁrst Fourier
mode slice by choosing c1 and c2 such that the phase angles of the ﬁrst Fourier modes of ˆω in the
x1 and x2 directions are equal to π, i.e. arg ˜ω(1, 0)+2πc1/L1 = π and arg ˜ω(0, 1)+2πc2/L2 = π. In
17

this way, the symmetry-reduced vorticity ﬁeld will appear centered in the domain. We can now use
arg ˜ω(1, 0) = arg ˜u2(1, 0)+π/2 and arg ˜ω(0, 1) = arg ˜u1(0, 1)−π/2 to express this choice of c1 and c2
in terms of the Fourier coeﬃcients of the velocity ﬁeld, resulting in c1 = −arg ˜u2(1, 0)L1/2π +L1/4
and c2 = −arg ˜u1(0, 1)L2/2π −L2/4.
Finally, we show in Appendix C that this choice of c
corresponds to the template function
ˆu′ =

sin 2πx2
L2
, sin 2πx1
L1
T
.
(66)
The ﬁrst Fourier mode slice deﬁned above can be readily applied to our stochastic SDO equations
by choosing (66) as our template function. In this way, all symmetry-reduced realizations ˆu(x, t; ω)
have the phase of their ﬁrst Fourier modes in the x and y directions ﬁxed to π and therefore remain
centered in the two-dimensional physical space. Furthermore, it is possible to show that using
template (66), the matrix T appearing in equation (54) is diagonal, with the two diagonal elements
given respectively by the amplitudes of the ﬁrst Fourier modes of u2 in the x direction and u1 in
the y direction. As such, T is well conditioned so long as the ratio of these two quantities does
not get large, and equation (54) is well posed as long as these quantities remain nonzero for all
realizations and at all times. This condition is always true unless one of the realizations has spatial
periodicity equal to half that of the domain, which is unlikely to happen in practice.
4.4
Initialization of the SDO quantities
Given an initial ensemble of realizations u0(x; ω), the initial conditions for the quantities involved
in the SDO computation are found by a two-step process similar to Section 3.4, where (i) the
symmetry-reduced version ˆu0(x; ω) of each realization is calculated, leading to the initial stochastic
translation amount c0(ω), and (ii) the initial symmetry-reduced mean ¯u0(x), modes ˆui0(x) and
stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω) are obtained from a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion of ˆu0(x; ω).
Step 1. First, the symmetry-reduced counterparts ˆu0(x; ω) = g−1(c0(ω))u0(x; ω) of the initial
realizations u0(x; ω) are given by
ˆu0(x; ω) = u0(x + c0(ω); ω)
=
X
k1,k2∈Z
˜u0(k1, k2; ω)ei2π(k1c10(ω)/L1+k2c20(ω)/L2)ei2π(k1x1/L1+k2x2/L2),
(67)
where ˜u0(k1, k2; ω) = (˜u10(k1, k2; ω), ˜u20(k1, k2; ω))T are the Fourier coeﬃcients associated to each
realization u0(x; ω) = (u10(x; ω), u20(x; ω))T. To bring the symmetry-reduced state ˆu0(x; ω) to
the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice, we proceed according to Section 4.3 and choose the initial stochas-
tic translation amount c0(ω) = (c10(ω), c20(ω))T as c10(ω) = −arg ˜u20(1, 0; ω)L1/2π + L1/4 and
c20(ω) = −arg ˜u10(0, 1; ω)L2/2π −L2/4.
Step 2. The initial symmetry-reduced realizations ˆu0(x; ω) can then be approximated through
a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion, giving a set of symmetry-reduced modes and stochastic
coeﬃcients from which the SDO modes and coeﬃcients can be initialized. Deﬁning ﬁrst the initial
symmetry-reduced mean ¯u0(x) = E[ˆu0(x; ω)], the initial symmetry-reduced orthonormal modes
ˆui0(x) are then given by the s most energetic eigenfunctions of the following eigenvalue problem
ZZ
D
R(x, y)ˆui0(x) dxdy = λiˆui0(y),
y ∈D,
i = 1, ..., s,
(68)
where the correlation matrix is R(x, y) = E[(ˆu0(x; ω) −¯u0(x))(ˆu0(y; ω) −¯u0(y))T]. Finally, the
18

associated initial stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω) are obtained by projection of the initial symmetry-
reduced realizations to the symmetry-reduced modes
Yi0(ω) = ⟨ˆu0(x; ω) −¯u0(x), ˆui0(x)⟩,
i = 1, ..., s.
(69)
In section 4.6, we will compare numerical results from the SDO framework with results from
the regular DO equations. In the case of DO, the various quantities are initialized following Step
2 directly, i.e. the initial mean ¯u0(x), modes ui0(x) and stochastic coeﬃcients Yi0(ω) are deﬁned
from a truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion of the initial full state space realizations u0(x; ω).
4.5
Numerical scheme
The SDO equations for the mean and the modes are implemented using a standard pseudo-spectral
method in space with 3/2 dealiasing and explicit Euler ﬁnite diﬀerences in time. The stochastic
coeﬃcients and translation amount are integrated in time with respectively a 4th-order Runge-
Kutta and a 2-step Adams-Bashforth scheme, both using a particle method. Note that setting
the stochastic translation amount to zero in the SDO equations readily yields the standard DO
scheme. For both SDO and DO, we use L1 = L2 = 2π, 64 × 64 Fourier modes, ∆t = 0.001 and
1000 Monte-Carlo particles.

Example on a stochastically advected vortex
We now use the SDO equations to compute the transient ﬂow of a randomly advected stochastic
Lamb-Oseen vortex, described by the following initial velocity ﬁeld

where r =

(x1 −L1/2)2 + (x2 −L2/2)2 and θ = arctan x2/x1. In the above initial condition, a
Lamb-Oseen vortex centered in the domain with random radial length scale rc(ω) ∼N(0.2, 10−4)
is superimposed to a uniform ﬂow of unit magnitude and random direction ψ(ω) ∼U(0, π/2). We
take Γ = 10 and set the Reynolds number to Re = 40. Each realization ω deﬁned by the above
initial condition therefore undergoes viscous diﬀusion while being simultaneously advected in a
given direction due to the uniform ﬂow. Thus, after a ﬁnite time, the realizations will have moved
away from their initial position to various locations in the domain.
The SDO simulation is initialized according to the procedure described in Section 4.4. For
comparison purposes, we also perform a regular DO simulation of the same problem and we use 6
modes in both computations. Since (70) deﬁnes the initial realizations as centered in the domain,
they are initially identical to their symmetry-reduced counterparts which are also required to be
centered in the domain. It therefore follows that the initial conditions for the SDO and DO mean
and modes are the same, and they are displayed in Figure 7 in terms of their vorticity (background
color) and velocity (arrows) ﬁelds. Notice that the ﬁrst two modes mainly represent the variability
due to the uniform advection ﬂow of unit magnitude and random direction, whereas the subsequent
modes account for the variability due to the random radial length scale of the Lamb-Oseen vortex.
Figure 8 shows the symmetry-reduced mean ¯u(x, t) and symmetry-reduced modes ˆui(x, t) of
the SDO solution at time t = 2.5, together with one full state space realization reconstructed from
the SDO quantities through the group transformation (63). Compared with the initial condition
shown in Figure 7, we observe that the symmetry-reduced mean and modes have remained at their
initial location and have merely diﬀused out due to viscosity. On the other hand, the realization

has not only diﬀused out but has moved away from the center of the domain along the path shown
by the white line, thanks to the stochastic shift amount c(t; ω) which has tracked the advection
due to the stochastic uniform ﬂow.
In the left-hand side of Figure 9, we further display the individual trajectories of 100 realizations,
obtained from the time history of the shift amount. The realizations move away from their initial
position at unit velocity and in a random direction uniformly distributed between 0 and π/2,
eventually landing at ﬁnal time on a circle of radius 2.5. These trajectories are expected given the
initial condition (70), but nonetheless remarkable since the SDO equations do not have a priori
knowledge of the paths followed by the realizations. The exact radial distance ||c(t; ω)|| of the
realizations to their initial position at ﬁnal time is shown in the right-hand side of Figure 9 and has
negligible standard deviation on the order of 10−11, which demonstrates the numerical accuracy of
the stochastic shift amount.
For comparison purposes, Figure 10 shows the mean ¯u(x, t) and modes ui(x, t) of the DO
solution at time t = 2.5, together with one realization. Since the standard DO scheme directly
performs order reduction in the full state space, the DO mean and modes need to account for the
spatial dispersion of the realizations. As a consequence, the modes in Figure 10 do not directly
reﬂect the shape of each individual vortex and a limited number of them is unable to accurately
reproduce each realization. On the contrary, the SDO modes are physically more relevant since
they directly reveal the underlying non-trivial dynamics of the solution.
Figure 11 shows the statistics of the ﬁrst four SDO (left) and DO (right) stochastic coeﬃcients
at initial and ﬁnal times, displayed in terms of two-dimensional marginals. The statistical structure
of the SDO solution remains identical over time except for some decline in the variance of Y3 and Y4
due to viscous diﬀusion. On the other hand, the statistical structure of the DO solution completely
changes over time since the modes have to account for the spatial translation of each realization,
thereby obscuring the fact that each individual vortex is merely diﬀusing besides the advection.
This diﬀerence in the amount of stochastic variability accounted for by the modes is clearly
apparent in Figure 12, which displays the time evolution of the energy in the mean ⟨¯u, ¯u⟩and
the variance of the stochastic coeﬃcients E[Y 2
i ] for the SDO (left) and DO (right) solutions. The
variance of the SDO mean and modes decreases over time since the symmetry-reduced state simply
undergoes viscous diﬀusion. On the other hand, that of their DO counterparts grows over time

Conclusions
In this work, we have introduced a novel methodology for eﬃcient order reduction of stochastic
dynamical systems with continuous symmetries. This methodology is composed of two steps. In
a ﬁrst step, one performs symmetry reduction of the original dynamical system using the method
of slices. In this way, the dynamics of the original system is decoupled into shape deformations,
captured by a symmetry-reduced stochastic state ﬁxed in the physical domain, and motion along
the symmetry directions of the system, tracked by a set of scalar phase parameters. The second
step consists in order reduction of the symmetry-reduced stochastic state, using any standard order
reduction method of choice. Since the symmetry-reduced state is ﬁxed in the physical domain,
24

this procedure results in very eﬃcient mixed symmetry-dimensionality reduction schemes. In par-
ticular, using the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) equations to perform the second step, we have
obtained a new Symmetry-reduced Dynamically Orthogonal (SDO) scheme that shows much better
performance than DO on stochastic solutions of the 1D Korteweg-de Vries and 2D Navier-Stokes
equations.
Even though both examples we have presented consider translation invariance and utilize pe-
riodic boundary conditions, it is important to recognize that continuous symmetries can arise in
bounded domains as well. A prominent example is axisymmetric systems, for instance the ﬂow past
an axisymmetric body or in a Taylor-Couette cell. Using axisymmetric coordinates, the rotational
symmetry translates to translational invariance in the azimuthal direction, allowing for the direct
application of our technique. Furthermore, while we have only considered stochasticity through
the initial conditions, we expect our framework to be equally applicable to stochastic operators
provided that the stochastic terms (either coeﬃcients or forcing) are statistically homogeneous in
the symmetry direction, ensuring that the equivariance condition (3) is satisﬁed in a statistical
sense.
In general, we expect this methodology to work well whenever the stochastic solution is com-
posed of coherent structures or sharp gradients like in shock waves. Possible future work could
include the extension of this framework to dynamical systems with self-similar solutions, which can
also be symmetry-reduced with the method of slices by rescaling time as well [2, 29, 32]. Finally, one
could also envision complementing our method with data assimilation techniques such as Bayesian
inference, to which group transformation ideas have already been applied [26].

A
DO order reduction preserves symmetry reduction
In this appendix, we show that after DO order reduction of the symmetry-reduced equations, the
dynamics of the reduced-order solution remain conﬁned to the symmetry-reduced state space. First,
assume that the phase parameters φ satisfy the stochastic equation (24), which implies
⟨F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu), t′
b⟩= 0,
(71)
for all symmetry directions b = 1, ..., N and all reduced-order realizations (18). We also assume
that at the current time instant, the mean and the modes satisfy the slice condition (11), that is
⟨¯u, t′
a⟩= ⟨ˆui, t′
a⟩= 0. Then, taking the inner products of the evolution equation (20) for the mean
with the template tangents, we ﬁnd that
⟨∂¯u
∂t , t′
b⟩= ⟨E[F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu)], t′
b⟩= E[⟨F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu), t′
b⟩] = 0,
(72)
for b = 1, ..., N. Likewise, taking the inner products of the evolution equation (22) for the modes
with the template tangents, we have
⟨∂ˆui
∂t , t′
b⟩= ⟨ˆHi, t′
b⟩−⟨ˆHi, ˆuj⟩⟨ˆuj, t′
b⟩= 0,
(73)
25

where we have used ⟨ˆuj, t′
b⟩= 0 and the fact that
⟨ˆHi, t′
b⟩= ⟨E[Yk(F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu))] C−1
ik , t′
b⟩= E[YkC−1
ik ⟨F(ˆu) −˙φata(ˆu), t′
b⟩] = 0.
(74)
As in (16), equations (72) and (73) show that the mean and modes will satisfy the slice condition
(11) throughout time integration, so that the reduced-order solution (18) remains conﬁned to the
symmetry-reduced state space. Numerical round-oﬀerrors remain negligible in our simulations.
B
First Fourier mode slice for the KdV equation
Here, we justify that the template function (44) corresponds to the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice deﬁned
in Section 3.3, that is the slice condition ⟨ˆu, t(ˆu′)⟩= 0 is satisﬁed when the phase angle of the
ﬁrst Fourier mode of ˆu is equal to π.
First, note that the inner product between two generic
states u(x) and v(x) can be expressed in terms of their Fourier coeﬃcients ˜u(k) = a(k) + ib(k) and
˜v(k) = c(k) + id(k) as
⟨u, v⟩= L
"

(75)
where we have used that ˜u(−k) = ˜u∗(k) and ˜v(−k) = ˜v∗(k) since u and v are real. If we now denote
˜ˆu(k) = a(k) + ib(k) and ˜ˆu′(k) = c(k) + id(k) the Fourier coeﬃcients of the symmetry-reduced state
ˆu and template ˆu′, respectively, we can use (75) to express the slice condition as
⟨ˆu, t(ˆu′)⟩= ⟨ˆu, −∂xˆu′⟩= 4π
∞
X
k=1
(ka(k)d(k) −kb(k)c(k)) = 0.
(76)
The ﬁrst Fourier mode slice is deﬁned by arg ˜ˆu(1) = π, thus b(1) = 0, a(1) < 0 and all other
coeﬃcients a(k), b(k) are possibly non-zero.
Except for the sign of a(1), these conditions are
equivalent to the above slice condition when c(1) ̸= 0 and all other coeﬃcients c(k), d(k) are zero.
Hence a valid choice of template is
ˆu′ = cos 2πx
L ,
(77)
which corresponds to c(1) = 1/2. With this template, the slice condition (76) reduces to ⟨ˆu, t(ˆu′)⟩=
−2πb(1) = 0, which is equivalent to requiring that arg ˜ˆu(1) = 0 or π. This ambiguity between zero
and π is not a problem in the actual SDO computations since the symmetry-reduced state ˆu
is initialized with arg ˜ˆu(1, t0; ω) = π, and continuity of the phase angle during time integration
ensures that arg ˜ˆu(1, t; ω) does not jump to zero at later times. With the phase of its ﬁrst Fourier
mode ﬁxed, the symmetry-reduced stochastic state ˆu(x, t; ω) is eﬀectively pinned at a ﬁxed location
in space and this is accomplished with a generic template that is not problem-dependent.
C
First Fourier mode slice for the Navier-Stokes equation
Here, we justify that template (66) corresponds to the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice deﬁned in Section 4.3
for a two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld, that is, both slice conditions ⟨ˆu, t1(ˆu′)⟩= 0 and ⟨ˆu, t2(ˆu′)⟩= 0
are satisﬁed when the phase angles of the ﬁrst Fourier modes of ˆω in the x and y directions are equal
to π. First, note that the inner product between two generic states u(x) = (u1(x1, x2), u2(x1, x2))T
26

and v(x) = (v1(x1, x2), v2(x1, x2))T can be expressed in terms of their Fourier coeﬃcients ˜u(k) =
(˜u1(k1, k2), ˜u2(k1, k2))T and ˜v(k) = (˜v1(k1, k2), ˜v2(k1, k2))T as

have used the realness of uj and vj. If we now denote ˜ˆu(k) = (˜ˆu1(k1, k2), ˜ˆu2(k1, k2))T and ˜ˆu′(k) =

j(k1, k2) = cj(k1, k2) + idj(k1, k2), j = 1, 2. From
Section 4.3, one can show that the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice corresponds to arg ˜ˆu1(0, 1) = −π/2 and
arg ˜ˆu2(1, 0) = π/2, thus a1(0, 1) = a2(1, 0) = 0, b1(0, 1) < 0, b2(1, 0) > 0 and all other coeﬃcients
aj(k1, k2), bj(k1, k2), j = 1, 2 are possibly non-zero. Except for the signs of b1(0, 1) and b2(1, 0),
these conditions are equivalent to the slice conditions (79) when d1(0, 1) ̸= 0, d2(1, 0) ̸= 0 and all
other coeﬃcients cj(k1, k2), dj(k1, k2), j = 1, 2 are zero. Hence a valid choice of template is

which corresponds to d1(0, 1) = d2(1, 0) = −1/2. With this template, the slice conditions (79)
become ⟨ˆu, t1(ˆu′)⟩= −2πL2a2(1, 0) = 0 and ⟨ˆu, t2(ˆu′)⟩= −2πL1a1(0, 1) = 0, which means re-
quiring that arg ˜ˆu2(1, 0) = arg ˜ˆu1(0, 1) = ±π/2. Same as for the one-dimensional case, this ambi-
guity between ±π/2 is not an issue in the actual SDO computations since the symmetry-reduced
state ˆu is initialized according to the ﬁrst Fourier mode slice with arg ˜ˆu1(0, 1, t0; ω) = −π/2 and
arg ˜ˆu2(1, 0, t0; ω) = π/2. Continuity of the phase angles during time integration then ensures that
arg ˜ˆu1(0, 1, t; ω) and arg ˜ˆu2(1, 0, t; ω) do not jump to the other root at later times.
