In this work, the efﬁcient quantum error-correction protocol against the general independent noise is con-
structed with the three-qubit quantum error-correction codes. The rules of concatenation are summarized ac-
cording to the error-correcting capability of the codes. The codes not only play the role of correcting errors, but
the role of polarizing the effective channel. The performance of the protocol is dependent on the type of noise
and the level of concatenation. For the general Pauli noise, the threshold of the protocol is 0.91518 when against
the depolarizing noise, while for the amplitude damping noise it is about 0.849. For the general independent
noise, the threshold of the protocol is about 0.932, which is obtained through the numerical simulations. If
there is no limit on the level of concatenation, the error-correction threshold can be much lower. The physi-
cal resources costed by this protocol is multiple of the physical resources costed by realizing the three-qubit
quantum error-correction, with no increase in complexity. We believe it will be helpful for realizing quantum
error-correction in the physical system.
Introduction.—In quantum computation and communica-
tion, quantum error-correction (QEC) developed from classic
schemes to preserving coherent states from noise and other
unexpected interactions. It was independently discovered by
Shor and Steane [1, 2]. The QEC conditions were proved
independently by Bennett, DiVincenzo, Smolin and Woot-
ters [3], and by Knill and Laﬂamme [4]. QEC codes are intro-
duced as active error-correction. The nine-qubit code was dis-
covered by Shor, called the Shor code. The seven-qubit code
was discovered by Steane, called the Steane code. The ﬁve-
qubit code was discovered by Bennett, DiVincenzo, Smolin
and Wootters [3], and independently by Laﬂamme, Miquel,
Paz and Zurek [5].
There are many constructions for speciﬁc classes of quan-
tum codes. Rains, Hardin, Shor and Sloane [6] have con-
structed interesting examples of quantum codes lying out-
side the stabilizer codes. Gottesman [7] and Rains [8] con-
struct non-binary codes and consider fault-tolerant computa-
tion with such codes. Aharonov and Ben-Or [9] construct
non-binary codes using interesting techniques based on poly-
nomials over ﬁnite ﬁelds, and also investigate fault-tolerant
computation with such codes. Approximate QEC can lead to
improved codes was shown by Leung, Nielsen, Chuang and
Yamamoto [10].
Calderbank and Shor [11], and Steane [12] used ideas from
classical error-correction to develop the CSS (Calderbank-
Shor-Steane) codes.
Calderbank and Shor also stated and
proved the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for CSS codes. Gottes-
man [13] invented the stabilizer formalism, and used it to de-
ﬁne stabilizer codes, and investigated some of the properties
of some speciﬁc codes. Independently, Calderbank, Rains,
Shor and Sloane [14] invented an essentially equivalent ap-
proach to QEC based on ideas from classical coding theory.
QEC codes are introduced as active error-correction.
Another way, passive error-avoiding techniques contain
decoherence-free subspaces [15–17] and noiseless subsys-
tem [18–20]. Recently, it has been proven that both the active
and passive QEC methods can be uniﬁed [21–23]. So, more
QEC codes means more options for suppressing noise, and
more options for optimizing the performance of QEC. Mean-
while, how to realize efﬁcient QEC with these codes in the
physical system is still an important question.
As known, the three-qubit code is not efﬁcient for arbitrary
one-qubit errors because of the Hamming bound. We still used
it for QEC simulation because it is the simplest QEC code.
The three-qubit code is bound to cause channel ﬁdelity to im-
prove when the weight of the polarizing error (Pauli-X, Y, or
Z) is above 2
3. The three-qubit code in Eq. (1) will change
the polarizing of the effective channel to Pauli-Z after QEC,
and the three-qubit code in Eq. (2) will change the polariz-
ing of the effective channel to Pauli-X after QEC. Based on
the reasons, under certain conditions, the QEC for arbitrary
one-qubit errors can be realized in nine-qubit channels when
the two three-qubit codes are applied in concatenated. Mean-
while, we should notice that correcting arbitrary one-qubit er-
rors is an equivalent description for the performance of QEC,
which means the channel ﬁdelity of the effective channel is no
less than f 9
0 + 9f 8
0 (1 −f0). Here, f0 is the channel ﬁdelity of
the initial channel, and 1 −f0 is the possibility of all errors in
the initial channel.
In this work, the efﬁcient quantum error-correction protocol
against the general independent noise is constructed with the
three-qubit quantum error-correction codes. The rules of con-
catenation are summarized according to the error-correcting
capability of the codes. The codes not only play the role of
correcting errors, but the role of polarizing the effective chan-
nel. The performance of the protocol is dependent on the type
of noise and the level of concatenation.
Three-qubit codes.—In the ﬁrst place, we introduce the two
simplest three-qubit QEC codes Fig. (1), because only the two
simplest three-qubit codes can be used for encoding the phys-
ical qubits. One is the bit-ﬂip code, which is the simplest code
with the stabilizer ⟨Z1Z2, Z2Z3⟩,
|0L⟩= |000⟩,
|1L⟩= |111⟩.
(1)
With the code, the state |ψ⟩= a|0⟩+b|1⟩is encoded to | ˜ψ⟩=
a|000⟩+ b|111⟩. For the code in Eq. (1), the correctable er-

2
rors are X1, X2, X3, Z1Z2, Z1Z3, Z2Z3, Y1Z2, Y1Z3, Y2Z3,
Z1Y2, Z1Y3, Z2Y3,
and Z1Z2X3, Z1Z3X2, Z2Z3X1
(for
Pauli-Y errors, the correctable errors are replacing the X as
Y , and the Y as X). Because the list of correctable errors re-
sult in the same states as X1, X2, X3, which are identiﬁable
and correctable,
X1| ˜ψ⟩= a|100⟩+ b|011⟩,
X2| ˜ψ⟩= a|010⟩+ b|101⟩,
X3| ˜ψ⟩= a|001⟩+ b|110⟩.
For Pauli-Y errors, the list of correctable errors result in
the same states as Y1, Y2, Y3, which are identiﬁable and cor-
rectable,
Y1| ˜ψ⟩= i[a|100⟩−b|011⟩],
Y2| ˜ψ⟩= i[a|010⟩−b|101⟩],
Y3| ˜ψ⟩= i[a|001⟩−b|110⟩].
The other is the phase-ﬂip code, which is the simplest code
with the stabilizer ⟨X1X2, X2X3⟩,
|0L⟩= 1
2[|000⟩+ |011⟩+ |101⟩+ |110⟩],
|1L⟩= 1
2[|111⟩+ |100⟩+ |010⟩+ |001⟩].
(2)
With the code, the state |ψ⟩= a|0⟩+ b|1⟩is encoded to
| ˜ψ⟩= a[|000⟩+ |011⟩+ |101⟩+ |110⟩] + b[|111⟩+ |100⟩+
|010⟩+ |001⟩]. For the code in Eq. (2), the correctable errors
are Z1, Z2, Z3, X1X2, X1X3, X2X3, Y1X2, Y1X3, Y2X3,
X1Y2, X1Y3, X2Y3, and X1X2Z3, X1X3Z2, X2X3Z1 (for
Pauli-Y errors, the correctable errors are replacing the Z as
Y , and the Y as Z). Because the list of correctable errors
result in the same states as Z1, Z2, Z3, which are identiﬁable
and correctable,
Z1| ˜ψ⟩= a[|000⟩+ |011⟩−|101⟩−|110⟩]
+b[−|111⟩−|100⟩+ |010⟩+ |001⟩],
Z2| ˜ψ⟩= a[|000⟩−|011⟩+ |101⟩−|110⟩]
+b[−|111⟩+ |100⟩−|010⟩+ |001⟩],
Z3| ˜ψ⟩= a[|000⟩−|011⟩−|101⟩+ |110⟩]
+b[−|111⟩+ |100⟩+ |010⟩−|001⟩].
For Pauli-Y errors, the list of correctable errors result in
the same states as Y1, Y2, Y3, which are identiﬁable and cor-
rectable,
Y1| ˜ψ⟩= i[a[|100⟩+ |111⟩−|001⟩−|010⟩]
+b[−|011⟩−|000⟩+ |110⟩+ |101⟩]],
Y2| ˜ψ⟩= i[a[|010⟩−|001⟩+ |111⟩−|100⟩]
+b[−|101⟩+ |110⟩−|000⟩+ |011⟩]],
Y3| ˜ψ⟩= i[a[|001⟩−|010⟩−|100⟩+ |111⟩]
+b[−|110⟩+ |101⟩+ |011⟩−|000⟩]].
Then, we introduce other two three-qubit QEC codes,
which can not be used for encoding the physical qubits, but

circuits for the bit-ﬂip code.
the QEC protocol may be simpliﬁed with them. When they
are used for encoding the physical qubits, efﬁcient error cor-
rection can not be realized because the logical code words will
be degenerate. One is obtained by applying the logical H on
the code in Eq. (1),
|0L⟩=

Performance for the general Pauli noise.—The general
Pauli noise is represented by ε0,
ε0 = f0ˆσI + pxˆσx + pyˆσy + pzˆσz.
Here, f0 is the channel ﬁdelity, and px, py, pz is the proba-
bility of the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, respectively. There are
four different schemes for the general Pauli noise when it is
the physical noise, and only the codes in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)
are available. The effective channel can be represented by ε1
after one-level QEC.
For the code in Eq. (1), when correcting X1, X2, X3,
f1 = f 3
0 + 3f 2
0px + 3f0p2
z + 6f0pypz + 3pxp2

When correcting Y1, Y2, Y3, the results can be obtained by re-
placing the px with py, and the py with px in Eq. (5).
For the code in Eq. (2), when correcting Z1, Z2, Z3,
f1 = f 3
0 + 3f 2

When correcting Y1, Y2, Y3, the results can be obtained by re-
placing the pz with py, and the py with pz in Eq. (6).
Here, f1 is the channel ﬁdelity, and p1x, p1y, p1z is the
probability of the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, respectively. In
general cases, f0 ≫px, py, pz. So, based on the value of p1z
in Eq. (5) and p1x in Eq. (6), the three-qubit codes have the
ability to polarize the effective channel. The code in Eq. (1)
will polarize the effective channel to Pauli-Z, and the code
in Eq. (2) will polarize the effective channel to Pauli-X. This
phenomenon makes the effective channel more correctable,
and increases the possibility of realizing efﬁcient QEC with
the three-qubit codes.
Rules of concatenation.—Based on the Eq. (5) and Eq. (6),
48 different combinations with the four Pauli operators are
correctable when concatenated the two codes in Eq. (1) and
Eq. (2). Fortunately, the correctable errors contain all one-
wight errors, which is the necessary condition for efﬁcient
QEC. Now, the core problem we need to solve becomes how
to improve performance under the premise of efﬁcient QEC.
There are three rules we should follow,
1. The codes used for encoding the physical qubits must
be the simplest three-qubit codes. Otherwise, the logical code
words will be degenerate in concatenated QEC.
2. If the Pauli-Y errors need to be corrected, it should be
done in the physical qubits. Otherwise, the best performance
can not be reached, because the effective channel will be ap-
proaching to Pauli-Z or Pauli-X after QEC with any three-
qubit code. In the case py ≤px, pz, the Pauli-Y errors can
be neglected. In the rest cases, the Pauli-Y errors need to be
corrected, and the choice of code depends on the weights of
Pauli-X and Pauli-Z. When pz > px, a better performance can
be reached with the code in Eq. (1). When pz < px, a better
performance can be reached with the code in Eq. (2). When
pz = px, the same performance is reached with the codes in
Eq. (1) and Eq. (2).
3. In the logical level-l, the choice of code depends on the
weights of Pauli-X, Pauli-Y and Pauli-Z. Here, plx, ply, plz
is the probability of the Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z in concate-
nated level-l, respectively. If ply is the maximum, the choice
of code depends on the values of plx and plz. When plz > plx,
a better performancecan be reached with the code in Eq. (1) or
Eq. (3). When plz < plx, a better performance can be reached
with the code in Eq. (2) or Eq. (4). If plx is the maximum, a
better performance can be reached with the code in Eq. (1) or
Eq. (3). If plz is the maximum, a better performance can be
reached with the code in Eq. (2) or Eq. (4). Here, we introduce
the codes in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), because they may make the
concatenated protocol much simpler. As known from Eq. (5)
and Eq. (6), the code in Eq. (1) will polarize the effective
channel to Pauli-Z, and the code in Eq. (2) will polarize the
effective channel to Pauli-X. When applied logical H on the
codes in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the code in Eq. (3) will polarize
the effective channel to Pauli-X, and the code in Eq. (4) will
polarize the effective channel to Pauli-Z. The codes in Eq. (3)
and Eq. (4) can be repeated in the logical level of concatenated
QEC, usually from the level-2 or level-3.

Examples.—Before applying the concatenated QEC with
three-qubit codes, we introduce the representation of the pro-
tocol. Written Ci(ˆσj), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, j = x, y, z, Ci represents
which code in Eq. (1) to (4) is applied, and (ˆσj) represents
which errors are corrected with this code.
1.
Depolarizing channel.
Based on the rules of con-
catenation, it is depolarizing channel that the worst per-
formance of the protocol against the general Pauli noise.
When limit the concatenated level l = 2, one protocol writ-
ten as C1(ˆσx)C2(ˆσz), and the error-correction threshold is
f0 = 0.91518.
A much lower error-correction threshold
f0 = 0.875 can be reached with no limit on the concatenated
level, which is obtained after one 10-level protocol written as
C2(ˆσz)C1(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)
C4(ˆσz)C4(ˆσz) applied. In order to show the evolution of the
effective channel, we apply one 10-level protocol written as
C1(ˆσy)C2(ˆσz)C2(ˆσz)C1(ˆσx)C2(ˆσz)C1(ˆσx)C2(ˆσz)C1(ˆσx)
C1(ˆσx)C2(ˆσz) on the depolarizing channel with ﬁdelity 0.92,
and the results are obtained in Table I.
2. Amplitude damping noise. There are two ways to se-
lect the optimal QEC protocol for none Pauli noise, one is
to treat it as an approximate Pauli channel, and the other
is dependent on the performance with all possible QEC
protocols.
The amplitude damping noise may be treated
as one channel, in which py
> px
> pz.
The QEC
protocol should begin with C2(ˆσy)C1(ˆσx), and the error-
correction threshold is f0
=
0.849 in the 2-level pro-
tocol.
If there was no limit on the number of concate-
nated level, the error-correction threshold can be f0
=
0.843, with one 8-level concatenated protocol written as
C2(ˆσy)C1(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx)C3(ˆσx).
3. Arbitrary independent noise. To simulate the arbitrary
independent noise, we ﬁxed the initial channel ﬁdelity f0 from
0.91518, then generated N = 300, 000 independent quantum

4
noise randomly through the noise model in Eq. (32) of [24].
For an unknown channel, there is only way to select the op-
timal QEC protocol, which is dependent on the performance
after all possible QEC protocols applied. Limited by the com-
puting power, we ﬁxed the concatenated level l = 2. There
are four different QEC protocols, written as C2(ˆσy)C1(ˆσx),
C1(ˆσy)C2(ˆσz), C2(ˆσz)C1(ˆσx), and C1(ˆσx)C2(ˆσz). For each
arbitrary independent noise channel, we apply the four proto-
cols, and pick the max ﬁdelity from the 8 effective channel
ﬁdelities. If any maximum ﬁdelity was lower than f0, we
should improve the initial channel ﬁdelity f0. Then, to re-
peat the previous process until no maximum ﬁdelity is lower
than f0. Through numerical simulations, the error-correction
threshold is about 0.932.
Cost.—The concatenated QEC protocol with three-qubit
codes is not only efﬁcient protocol for the general indepen-
dent noise, but also an error-correcting solution that consumes
fewer resources. The physical resources costed by the proto-
col is multiple of the physical resources costed by realizing
the three-qubit QEC, which is
Rl = 1 + 3 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 3l−1...
(7)
Here, Rl, l ≥1 is the cost of the l-level concatenated QEC
protocol, and 1 represents the cost of realizing three-qubit
QEC.
Conclusions and outlook.—In this work, the efﬁcient quan-
tum error-correction protocol against the general indepen-
dent noise is constructed with the three-qubit quantum error-
correction codes. The rules of concatenation are summarized
according to the error-correcting capability of the codes. The
codes not only play the role of correcting errors, but the role
of polarizing the effective channel. The performance of the
protocol is dependent on the type of noise and the level of
concatenation. For the general Pauli noise, the threshold of
the protocol is 0.91518 when against the depolarizing noise,
while for the amplitude damping noise it is about 0.849. For
the general independent noise, the threshold of the protocol is
about 0.932, which is obtained through the numerical simu-
lations. If there is no limit on the level of concatenation, the
error-correction threshold can be much lower.
In the realization of QEC, state preservation by repetitive
error detection has been done in a superconducting quantum
circuit [25], and estimation of consumption have been done
in [26]. In the concatenated QEC protocol with three-qubit
codes, no measurement is required, and the cost is minor as
shown in Eq. (7). Why the concatenated QEC protocol can be
efﬁcient, the reason may arise from the ability to change the
logical error when applying inner QEC, and the outer QEC
is good at suppressing it. Similar phenomena for other codes
have been noted in [24, 27, 28], but the realizations need more
complicated quantum gate operations. As an example in re-
alization, once the QEC with the three-qubit code had been
realized as in [29], the QEC for depolarizing noise can be ef-
ﬁcient when realizing four QECs with the three-qubit codes at
the same time.
