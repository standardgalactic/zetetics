This book tells you all you need to know to invest in this

down “winner-take-all” Internet with a safe and cornucopian
cadastre of trust and opportunity that makes us all potential
winners.
—GEORGE GILDER, cofounder of the
Discovery Institute and author of The
Scandal of Money
The growth and importance of cryptocurrency and
cryptocomputing rivals the early growth of the commercial
Internet and web, and the technical and economic revolution
that will result is perhaps even more significant than the first
phase of the Internet. Cryptoassets is an excellent introduction
to this breakthrough in technology and finance, and a
tremendous resource for those eager to get their heads around

what can be a daunting and complex subject.
—JEREMY ALLAIRE, CEO and founder

asset class. Delivered by two of the foremost authorities in the
nascent, multibillion-dollar space, this is the most extensive
guide on cryptoassets currently available.
—SANDRA RO, former head of
digitization at CME Group
As renowned industry thought leaders, it’s no surprise that

framework that readers will find intellectually stimulating and
illuminating for understanding this rapidly emerging world of
cryptoassets.
—SPENCER BOGART, managing

—ADAM WHITE, vice president of

enormous amounts of value are transmitted and secured via
blockchains, including the value of music and creative works.
Cryptoassets makes blockchains accessible to the nontechnical

fundamental value. If you’re looking for a grounded, first-
principles approach to the next wave of Internet innovation,
then this is a great book to read.

—WILLIAM MOUGAYAR, general
partner at Virtual Capital Ventures and
author of The Business Blockchain
Young, Stanford-trained blockchain analyst and investor Chris
Burniske has teamed up with financial planning expert and
author Jack Tatar to provide the first comprehensive guide to
understanding the fastest growing, most exciting asset class
under the sun. While many investors are still waking up to the
opportunity, these assets have already provided outsized
returns, as the overall market is now hovering around $100
billion, which is 10x from a year ago and 100x from four years
ago. Collectively referring to these investments as
“cryptoassets,” Burniske and Tatar provide a solid background
on how the technology arose, what problems it solves, and

how, like the Internet itself, it’s going to have a dramatic
impact on not only the venture capital process but on investing
itself. Don’t think of rebalancing your portfolio without
reading this book.
—MICHAEL TERPIN, founder of
Transform Group, organizer of
CoinAgenda, and cofounder of BitAngels
While the cryptoasset space has witnessed exponential growth,
to achieve its full potential, it has to be broadly integrated into
the real world. With consistent objectivity and clarity, Chris
and Jack’s book details cryptoassets as an asset class, and will
prove influential in driving institutional investor adoption of
this groundbreaking opportunity.
—JENNIFER ZHU SCOTT, founding
partner of Radian Partners and member of
the Future of Blockchain Council of the
World Economic Forum
Cryptoassets provides a great introduction to and overview of
the young yet rapidly growing universe of all things
blockchain. This industry, asset class, and overall idea will
make you ponder why abstract concepts like money, identity,
and business function like they do in the world today, and how
the innovation we’re seeing will completely reshape the
economy of tomorrow. From setting the stage to diving into
specific protocols and projects to sharing practical knowledge
on how to invest in these emerging assets, Chris and Jack’s
combination of expertise and familiarity with the complex
topics at hand are testament to why I have considered them

some of the best resources throughout my journey of falling
deeper and deeper down the crypto rabbit hole.
—ALEX SUNNARBORG, research
analyst at CoinDesk and cofounder of
Lawnmower.io
From inception to the latest phase, Cryptoassets explores the
past, present, and future of this new asset class. It’s not a hard
read yet delves into much of the detail needed for a complete
understanding of the benefits, and risks, of bitcoin, blockchain,
and more. Chris and Jack have written a book I highly
recommend to investors in this burgeoning field!
—PAT BOLLAND, former business
editor at CNBC, CBC, BNN
Cryptoassets is the bible for all things crypto. Whether you’re
a beginner or expert, you will walk away with a deeper
understanding of the entire ecosystem after reading this book.
—GREG ROSEN, principal at BoxGroup
Chris and Jack provide a holistic view of the origin, evolution,
and analysis of cryptoassets. It goes through their very short
but intense history, talks about methods for analyzing their
value, and identifies the ones with potential. I’d recommend it
to anyone who wants to dive into investing and understanding
how cryptoassets will shape the future of society and the
creation of value.
—LUIS CUENDE, cofounder of Aragon
and Stampery

Those of us who work in the blockchain industry have long
realized that the rise of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset
class was inevitable. But most traditional investors have been
slow on the uptick. Chris was the first buy-side analyst to
focus exclusively on this emerging asset class, and Jack was
one of the earliest financial journalists to stress its importance.
For years, Chris has been working hard to bring Wall Street’s
rigorous analytical methodologies to cryptocurrencies, while
Jack has been busy explaining the benefits of cryptocurrencies
to audiences around the world. Now, with Cryptoassets, they
describe, as nobody has before, why every investor should
incorporate bitcoin, ether, and new blockchain-based assets
into their portfolios, and how to analyze these tokens in order
to make the right investments.
—TRAVIS SCHER, investment associate
at Digital Currency Group
Chris and Jack have written our generation’s A Random Walk
Down Wall Street. This book is required reading for anyone
looking to get involved with and profit from the cryptoassets
boom.
—PATRICK ARCHAMBEAU, VP of
engineering at CoinDesk and cofounder of
Lawnmower.io
Chris and Jack have been fellow travelers in the blockchain
space since way before it was a polite cocktail party topic.
Over the years, we’ve laughed and marveled together at how
the space has evolved. This book could not be more timely in
describing an emerging $100+ billion financial market and all

of the chaos and promise it brings. The authors capture not
only the technical and market analysis you need to know to
invest in these projects but also the ethos and excitement of the
people pushing the envelope. Savor this book. It’s a time-
capsule view of the birth of an amazing technology.
—PETER KIRBY, cofounder and CEO of
Factom, Inc.
Burniske and Tatar thread the needle between an approachable
guide for newcomers and thought-provoking insights for
seasoned investors. I will surely be assigning it to my graduate
students as we cover cryptoassets.
—STEPHEN MCKEON, associate
professor of finance at the Lundquist
College of Business at the University of
Oregon
Token-based fund-raising is here to stay, and this book offers
the best way to value cryptoassets that I’ve seen. The book
provides background and the potential impacts of ICOs,
offering insightful knowledge to both those entering the space
and experienced investors like myself. I would recommend
this book for any crypto reading arsenal!
—PAUL VERADITTAKIT, partner at
Pantera Capital
Burniske and Tatar have now given me an easy response when
people ask how to get started with cryptoassets—this book!

Capital

This is a seminal work in the evolution of the cryptosphere as
digital money moves mainstream. The book covers the full
potential and array of what this technology offers in piercing
the veil to an Internet of value with all the new innovations
and crossovers from the traditional realm of finance. Chris and
Jack have brought a wealth of knowledge and cross-
disciplinary methods to bear from their respective fields and
broken new ground in their analysis of this exciting new space.
—CHARLIE HAYTER, cofounder and
CEO of CryptoCompare
Cryptoassets is a tour de force. Burniske and Tatar are able to
leverage their deep industry experience to condense a
complex, continually evolving topic into a concise and
informative guide for investors looking to be on the cutting
edge of a new asset class. Cryptoassets will serve as the entry
point to the space for retail investors for years to come.
—PIETER GORSIRA, software engineer
at CoinDesk and cofounder of
Lawnmower.io
In a world where issuing digital assets becomes as easy as
creating a website, Chris and Jack provide a comprehensive
guide that will help you separate the wheat from the chaff.
—DEMIAN BRENER, cofounder and
CEO of Zeppelin Solutions
As we enter the next great evolution in global financial
markets, Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar have authored a
unique and much-needed volume. It offers not only a

foundational understanding of cryptoassets and digital
currencies but also serves as a reference for evaluating and
participating in a cryptoasset future. A new asset class has
emerged, and Cryptoassets is the definitive guide.
—RON QUARANTA, chairman of the
Wall Street Blockchain Alliance
This book is very accessible, comprehensive, and easy to read
for any size investor. One of its strengths is its ability to be
valuable to the novice and the experienced professional alike.
—JARED HARWAYNE-GIDANSKY,
founding board member of the Blockchain
Association of Australia

exciting asset class.

Texas at Dallas

If you want to know how cryptoassets work, get Mastering
Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, but if you want to know
how and why you should be investing in this new asset class,
get yourself a copy of Cryptoassets.
—TRON BLACK, investor and principal
developer at Medici Ventures
Newcomers often try to wiggle their way into the world of
accepted financial tools. Most fail miserably. But
cryptocurrency and its accompanying blockchain technology
have made their mark and will likely have an ongoing impact
on how we all do business. Burniske and Tatar have written an
incredibly comprehensive book that explains what you need to
know about this new asset class.

executive director of the Retirement
Income Industry Association
The most complete and informational piece of literature on the
subject today. Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar steer the reader
through a torrent of unknowns, illuminating the complicated

world of cryptoassets and their underlying technology, which
will more than likely become our generation’s most important
innovation.
—RYAN LANCELOT, coauthor of
What’s the Deal with Bitcoins?
A must-read to appreciate the Bitcoin network effect and the
wave of innovation that it launched through the community of
people who played critical roles in creating all the distributed
ecosystems that are transforming business models.
—CRISTINA DOLAN, cofounder and
COO of InsureX
Crypto trading and the FinTech innovations unlocked by
blockchains will do to Wall Street what personal Internet
publishing and blogging did to media empires. This power
shift is inevitable. Capital allocation no longer needs to be
managed by powerful institutions which have proven to be
corrupt and reckless. Regulation and regulatory capture is
putting the U.S. at risk of losing out in the transition. Chris
Burniske and Jack Tatar give you, the individual, the tools to
evaluate these new cryptoassets and take advantage of what I
believe will be the greatest rebalancing of wealth and power
that the world has ever seen.

Authors’ Note
hen we started writing this book in December 2016, bitcoin
was in the $700s, ether was in the $7s, and the aggregate
network value of cryptoassets was just north of $10 billion.
Over the ensuing months of writing we watched bitcoin push
past $4,000, while ether crossed $400, and the aggregate
network value of cryptoassets punched through $100 billion.
Cryptoassets went from being esoteric dark web material to
mainstream topics of conversation and enthusiasm.
When embarking on our literary journey, we recognized the
difficulty in documenting arguably the world’s fastest moving
markets. These markets can change as much in a day—up or
down—as the stock market changes in a year. Nonetheless, we
were continually asked the same question: “What should I read
to get the full picture of what’s going on in these markets?”
The frequency of this question grew to a clamor as the markets
rose through the first half of 2017, and yet information
channels remained stubbornly fragmented among Reddit,
Twitter, Telegram, Slack, Medium, news sites, and more.
While we recognize the difficulty in covering the full
picture of the ever-moving cryptoasset markets, we believe
that this book provides a comprehensive view of the history,
technology, and marketplace dynamics of bitcoin and beyond.

We have crafted the book to be as evergreen as possible with
regard to the background and methodologies laid forth, so that
even as the markets change, the book retains its value. We
recognize that by the time you read this, some asset prices may
seem like the distant past, and some teams may be indignant
that we didn’t cover their story. We couldn’t possibly have
covered every price change and every story, or we would
never have published the book.
Our hope is to serve as a starting point and means to
understanding, so that we can all study and experience this
space together. It is a history that is still in its earliest stages of
being written.

W
Foreword
hen I first learned about bitcoin, I was convinced it would fail.
Based on a few articles and two decades of experience as a
skeptical trader, I loudly—and now regrettably—declared on
CNBC’s Fast Money that bitcoin would not survive. How
could it? It was not backed by any entity; it did not have a
central bank; it was not accepted for taxes; and it did not have
an army to enforce its use. What’s more, it was extremely
volatile and had a bad reputation—all of which would
contribute surely to its premature demise.
I have never been more incorrect in my entire career.
Somewhere in the CNBC archives exists an awkward video
of me railing against this “magic Internet money.” If you’re
reading this and have access to the video, treat it with the
respect it deserves and destroy it! Since those unenlightened
days, I have come to understand that bitcoin—and the
blockchain beneath it—is a technological advancement that
has the potential to revolutionize financial services the same
way email did to the post office.
Once I realized that blockchain technology was a disruptive
force, I sought out people who shared my view. I met Chris
Burniske at the very first Wall Street Blockchain Alliance
holiday party, and we immediately found common interest in

the potential for blockchain-based assets, or cryptoassets, to
become a new asset class for investors. At the time, very few
people saw bitcoin’s potential, but Chris did, and it was clear
to me that he possessed rare leadership and vision.
Jack Tatar is an expert in retirement planning who has spent
over two decades in the financial industry and brings a much-
needed perspective of finance and investment knowledge to
the cryptoasset world. New technology can be confusing and
intimidating, but through his engaging writing, Jack possesses
the unique ability to distill a complex subject into an easily
digestible serving. As a result of their combined perspectives,
Cryptoassets is a book that will satisfy the most curious minds
and engage those approaching the subject for the first time.
Readers will benefit not only from Chris and Jack’s vision
but also their deep knowledge of the topic. As the manager of
a hedge fund that invests in digital assets, I am constantly
researching this asset class’s investment potential, and when I
get stumped, my first call is to Chris Burniske. While I am
thrilled that Chris is sharing his unique insights in this book, I
am selfishly reluctant to lose my secret go-to resource. Layer
on Jack’s experience as one of the first financial journalists to
write about bitcoin, and you have a powerful combination. Let
them be your resource as well.
The beauty of this book is that it takes the reader on a
journey from bitcoin’s inception in the ashes of the Great
Financial Crisis to its role as a diversifier in a traditional
investment portfolio. Those who want to look under the hood
of blockchain technology will be thrilled with the skillful
description of the elegant architecture that powers this
technology, and financial historians, like myself, will find the

discussion of investment bubbles instructive. Chris and Jack
artfully apply financial history lessons to the cryptoasset
investment world. Spoiler alert: even though blockchain
technology is disrupting traditional financial market structures,
fear and greed remain uniquely human traits that can and will
find a place in cryptoassets. Thankfully, Chris and Jack give
readers the tools and knowledge to know what to look out for
when bubbles do occur.
Armed with this knowledge, the reader can then use the
valuation framework laid out in Chapters 12 and 13 to find the
most promising cryptoassets. Valuing cryptoassets is done
unlike traditional investments; they typically do not have
revenue or cash flows and thus present a conundrum for those
evaluating their merits. Here, Chris and Jack present
groundbreaking work on how to properly value an asset based
on the network effect and teams of decentralized developers.
Everyone who is even thinking about investing in cryptoassets
needs to read these chapters.
One of the most fascinating outcomes of the blockchain
revolution is how cryptoassets are disrupting the disruptors. As
Chris and Jack explain, the venture capital business model is
being turned on its head by crowdfunding efforts that include
initial cryptoasset offerings, or ICOs. Cryptoassets are made of
code, and because they easily track and convey ownership,
they can be used as fund-raising tools for startups. In the last
two years, there has been a wave of entrepreneurs that
bypassed venture capitalists and instead chose to raise startup
capital via these methods.
As with any new model, there are questions about legality
and sustainability, but the Silicon Valley ethos of “break

things first, then ask for forgiveness” has found its way to
Wall Street. Professionals who are involved in all aspects of
fund-raising—from venture capital to capital markets—will
find the discussion of these new methods of raising capital
riveting, maybe even a little frightening.
The final chapter of my book The Bitcoin Big Bang was
titled “Everything You Know About Business Is Wrong,” and
it previews what Chris and Jack have identified as a game-
changing development in the way capital is raised and
distributed. Self-funded, decentralized organizations are a new
species in the global economy that are changing everything we
know about business. A cryptoasset as the fuel for a
decentralized organization not only changes the organizational
chart, it also rearranges incentive structures.
These new organizations are altering the way software is
developed. Cryptoassets have inverted the value creation
structure that worked so well during the development of the
Internet. These so-called fat protocols are self-funding
development platforms that create and gain value as
applications are built on top. This is an entirely new paradigm
for open-source projects that incentivizes developers to build
socially useful projects.
When I started working on Wall Street, the Internet was
something on a computer at the end of the trading desk.
Amazon, eBay, and Google did not exist—but within five
years, these companies had changed the world. As a greenhorn
trader, I was too young and inexperienced to recognize that the
Internet was a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity. I
was convinced that I would not see another exponential
investment opportunity for the rest of my career—until I

discovered blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is
one of the most important innovations in the history of
finance. It is changing the way we transact, distribute capital,
and organize our companies. If you’re like me and missed
investing in the Internet, read this book so you can take
advantage of the biggest investment opportunity since the
Internet.

Thanks to Dad, who was a writer himself, and from a young
age had me journaling, writing summer book reports, and
submitting essays to justify the purchase of gadgets. He taught
me the importance of never having a TV in the house, that all
creativity comes at the cost of maintenance, and that
excellence should never be compromised.
Thanks to Mom, who has been a fountain of belief and
support through the good and the bad. While she may not
know much about blockchains (yet), she loves them because I
love them. She is the most positive person I know and the one
who has taught me how to find silver linings in the clouds.
Thanks to my brother, Justin, who resisted the urge to strangle
me when Mom was away, and taught me that power doesn’t
always have to corrupt.
Thank you to Cathie Wood, who plucked me from a
fishmongership and taught me that not all finance is bad. In a
few years, Cathie taught me more about economics, the
markets, and how the world works than I learned in my time at
Stanford. In a world where mentors are increasingly rare,
Cathie’s guidance has been pivotal in my life. Thank you to

Rob Wood, the friendly giant who introduced us.
Thanks to Brett Winton, who has taught me how to
approach the most complex of problems and that maybe I’m
not as dense as I fear. To Joel Monegro, who has been my
thematic torchbearer in the world of crypto, thank you. There’s
no one I look forward to brainstorming with more than you.
Thanks to James Wang, who taught me to love Twitter, and
that valuation matters.
Last but not least, thanks to Jack, who has been the driving
force behind this book. If not for a fateful lunch at Consensus
and Jack’s relentless enthusiasm, this book never would have
happened.

Thanks to the great Harry Markowitz for his advice and
insight. One of the wonderful results of this book has been my
ability to gain the friendship of this wonderful man. Thanks,
Harry! I’m humbled by your assistance.
Special thanks to my bubbie, Stu Sharoff, for taking the
dive into this wacky world, his advice on the cover, and for
being a brother to me for so many years. Thanks to Stu
Rosenberg for also taking the dive and providing such great
support and friendship over the years.
Special thanks for my angel investing partner and dear
friend, Ron Kochman, for his honest insight into the book and
for making this journey so much more entertaining. Also to
Steve Katz, who we miss every day.
Thanks to the great John Gioia for his advice and insight
throughout the entire process of creating this book. Thanks to
Irene Cibas for just being herself and putting up with John and

me for so many years. Thanks also to Bill Bonomo, John
Barbera, and David Fink for their help and support during the
years when I needed it. Of course, thanks to the legendary Sam
Kirk for his assistance throughout this process.
To my Mom and Dad, who may not be here physically, but
inspire and direct me each and every day.
Most of all, thanks to my family, who put up with me
during this process. I couldn’t have done any of it without you.
To my children, Eric and Grace, I could never fully articulate
how important and valuable your advice and support has been
to me. You’re my inspiration for everything.
Finally, to the reason for my being and the love of my life,
my Maudee Ann. No one knows better than you what crazy
schemes and ideas I’ve had in my life, and you’ve endured
them and supported me throughout. I thank God for allowing
me the opportunity to live my life with you, and I thank you
for, well, everything. I love you more than words can tell …
always!
And of course, to my terrific coauthor, Chris, who brings
intellect, humor, compassion, and honesty to everything he
does. The best part of this book was making your friendship.

Introduction
ooks, TV shows, and movies have been making futuristic
predictions for decades, many of which were originally
considered absurd. Star Trek featured several that proved to be
not so outlandish: the indispensable handheld communicators
have become today’s smartphones, the personal access display
device is now our tablet, and a universal translator exists, of
which there are several apps to choose. Edward Bellamy’s
enigmatically titled 1887 book Looking Backward predicted
debit and credit cards, and 2001: A Space Odyssey imagined
forms of social media, though nothing on the scale that we
currently have. Alvin Toffler’s Future Shock gripped readers
in the 1970s as it predicted the exponential change destined to
shake our society, and issued a warning: “In the three short
decades between now and the twenty-first century, millions of
ordinary, psychologically normal people will face an abrupt
collision with the future.” This future would create “the
shattering stress and disorientation that we induce in
individuals by subjecting them to too much change in too short
a time.”
Exponential change has now become a buzzword, but the
power of an exponential curve is rarely considered. Each year
will entail greater change than the year before. Such a concept

differs drastically from a linear rate of change, where the
future will change just as quickly as the past did (see Figure
I.1.) The two may appear similar in the early days of change,
but when the exponential curve starts to inflect it quickly, and
at times violently, it distinguishes itself.
Figure I.1 
 Exponential versus linear rates of change
While year 1 exhibits the exact same value for linear and
exponential change in Figure I.1, as does year 2, by year 7 an
exponential rate has progressed nearly tenfold more than the
corresponding seventh period of linear change. We often
operate with the rough assumption that the rate of change over
the next year or two will be roughly equal to that over the prior
years, which is a linear world view. That works for the early
stage of change, but not when the exponential curve starts to
bend like a hockey stick. Unfortunately, most investment
portfolios are being managed with a linear world view, with

indices that are pegged to the past guiding our future
investments. Nothing could be more shortsighted or
potentially dangerous in a time of exponential change.
The Internet has irrevocably changed the world, and it
continues to do so as developers build on the platform of
connection it creates. Thus far, the World Wide Web has been
the greatest meta-application to leverage the underlying fiber
of the Internet. The indexed web contains at least 4.73 billion
pages, nearing the point where there will be one page for every
human.
The beginning of the Internet is commonly associated with
the 1990s, with Tim Berners-Lee stumbling upon the idea of
the World Wide Web while trying to create an information
management system for CERN, and Marc Andreessen
developing the first widely used web browser, which
ultimately became Netscape. Although the accomplishments
of Berners-Lee and Andreessen were linchpins to mainstream
adoption, the web and the ability to browse it were the first
killer apps built on top of the Internet, not to be conflated with
the creation of the Internet itself. We are likely still in the early
stages of leveraging the potential of the Internet and building
meta-applications atop it.
The Internet was first conceptualized in the early 1960s to
create resilient communication systems that would survive a
nuclear attack on the United States. According to one of the
Internet’s progenitors, Paul Baran, the key to accomplishing
such resilience was decentralization.  J. C. R. Licklider
proselytized the concept of an “Intergalactic Computer
Network,” convincing his colleagues at DARPA—which is
responsible for investigating and developing new technologies
1
2

for the U.S. military—of its importance.  Leonard Kleinrock,
an MIT professor, was doing work on packet switching—the
technology underpinning the Internet—that would lead to the
first book on the subject: Communication Nets. Ironically,
though they were all working on a means to connecting the
world, many of the early researchers in this period were
unaware of one another.
But their dream has been realized. Every day more than 3.5
billion Google search queries are made,  18.7 billion text
messages are sent (that doesn’t even include WhatsApp and
Facebook Messenger, which combine for more than 60 billion
messages per day),  and 269 billion emails are sent.
Interestingly, however, the Internet has become increasingly
centralized over time, potentially endangering its original
conception as a “highly survivable system.”
Human ingenuity often surfaces when it’s most needed, and
now, a new technology is emerging that returns to the
decentralized ethos of the original Internet with the potential to
revolutionize our computational and transactional
infrastructure: blockchain technology. Every second, millions
of packets of information are transacted between humans and
machines using the Internet, and blockchain technology is
forcing us to rethink the costs, security, and ownership of
these transactions.
Blockchain technology came from Bitcoin. In other words,
Bitcoin is the mother of blockchain technology. Bitcoin, with a
capital B, is a platform that carries upon it programmable
money, known as bitcoin with a lowercase b. The
technological foundation to this platform is a distributed and
digital ledger referred to as a blockchain. In January 2009,
3
4
5
6

when Bitcoin was first released, it embodied the first working
implementation of a blockchain the world had seen.
Since then, people have downloaded the open-source
software that is Bitcoin, studied its blockchain, and released
different blockchains that go far beyond Bitcoin. Blockchain
technology can now be thought of as a general purpose
technology, on par with that of the steam engine, electricity,
and machine learning.
To quote a May 2016 article in Harvard Business Review
by Don and Alex Tapscott: “The technology most likely to
change the next decade of business is not the social web, big
data, the cloud, robotics, or even artificial intelligence. It’s the
blockchain, the technology behind digital currencies like
bitcoin.”
Incumbents are sensing the inherent creative destruction,
especially within the financial services sector, understanding
that winners will grow new markets and feast off the
disintermediated. Many startups are eyeing these middlemen
with the oft-flickering thought that has been credited to
Amazon’s Jeff Bezos: “Your fat margins are my
opportunity.”
If financial incumbents don’t embrace the technology
themselves, Bitcoin and blockchain technology could do to
banks what cell phones did to telephone poles. Nearly every
global bank, exchange, custodian, and financial services
provider is part of some blockchain consortium, investing in
the potential disruptors or internally building its own team.
These players include JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citibank,
the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Banco Santander,
Barclays, UBS, South African Reserve Bank, Bank of Tokyo
7
8

Mitsubishi, Mizuho, China Merchants Bank, Australian Stock
Exchange, and more.
Financial incumbents are aware blockchain technology puts
on the horizon a world without cash—no need for loose bills,
brick-and-mortar banks, or, potentially, centralized monetary
policies. Instead, value is handled virtually, through a system
that has no central authority figure and is governed in a
decentralized and democratic manner. Mathematics force
order in the operations. Our life savings, and that of our heirs,
could be entirely intangible, floating in a soup of secure 1s and
0s, the entire system accessed through computers and
smartphones.
Technology providers smell the disruption as well, with
Microsoft and IBM most vocally leading the charge. Microsoft
provides Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) for developers within
its Azure cloud platform. Marley Gray, its director of
technology strategy, has said, “We want, and frankly our
customers want, access to every blockchain. It could be two
guys in a garage that forked bitcoin and had this genius idea
and people want to try that out. We don’t want to have any
barriers. We’re open to all. We help even the smallest players
onboard.”
Just as the Internet and World Wide Web changed how we
live our lives and interact with others, it also made millionaires
out of the innovators who began companies based on these
technologies—and the investors who invested in them. Those
with the foresight to have bought Google during its “Initial
Public Offering” (IPO) would have seen a 1,800 percent
appreciation by August 2016, and those who bought Amazon’s
IPO would have seen a 1,827 percent appreciation.

Blockchain architectures and their native assets are well on
their way to becoming the next great meta-application to
leverage Internet infrastructure. They already provide services
that include global currencies, world computers, and
decentralized social networks, among hundreds of others.
The native assets historically have been called
cryptocurrencies or altcoins, but we prefer the term
cryptoassets, which is the term we will use throughout the
book. The terms cryptocurrencies and altcoins convey only a
fraction of the innovation that is occurring in the cryptoasset
economy. Not all of the 800 existing cryptoassets are
currencies. We are not just witnessing the decentralized
creation of currencies but also of commodities and polished
digital goods and services, as blockchains meld technology
and the markets to build Web 3.0.
It’s early enough in the life of blockchain technology that
no books yet have focused solely on public blockchains and
their native cryptoassets from the investing perspective. We
are changing that because investors need to be aware of the
opportunity and armed both to take advantage and protect
themselves in the fray.
Inevitably, innovations of such magnitude, fueled by the
mania of making money, can lead to overly optimistic
investors. Investors who early on saw potential in Internet
stocks encountered the devastating dot-com bubble. Stock in
Books-A-Million saw its price soar by over 1,000 percent in
one week simply by announcing it had an updated website.
Subsequently, the price crashed and the company has since
delisted and gone private. Other Internet-based high flyers that
ended up crashing include Pets.com, Worldcom, and

WebVan.  Today, none of those stocks exist.
Whether specific cryptoassets will survive or go the way of
Books-A-Million remains to be seen. What’s clear, however,
is that some will be big winners. Altogether, between the
assets native to blockchains and the companies that stand to
capitalize on this creative destruction, there needs to be a game
plan that investors use to analyze and ultimately profit from
this new investment theme of cryptoassets. The goal of this
book is not to predict the future—it’s changing too fast for all
but the lucky to be right—but rather to prepare investors for a
variety of futures.
Bitcoin, the most widely known cryptoasset, has been
riding a roller coaster. If one had invested $100 in bitcoin in
October 2009—the first time an exchange rate was established
for the nascent digital currency—one would now have over
$100 million. In November 2013, if one had invested that
same $100 in bitcoin, one would have endured an 86 percent
drop by January 2015. There are nearly 800 other stories to
tell, considering there are over 800 cryptoassets floating on
globally connected and ever-on markets. At the end of 2016, a
list of the top 50 included:
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum Classic, Dash,
MaidSafeCoin, NEM, Augur, Steem, Iconomi, Dogecoin, Factom,
Waves, Stellar Lumens, DigixDAO, Zcash, Lisk, Xenixcoin, E-Dinar
Coin, Swiscoin, GameCredits, Ardor, BitShares, LoMoCoin, Bytecoin,
Emercoin, AntShares, Gulden, Golem, Tether, ShadowCash, Xaurum,
Storjcoin, Stratis, Nxt, Peercoin, I/O Coin, Rubycoin, Bitcrystals,
SingularDTV, Counterparty, Agoras Tokens, Siacoin, YbCoin,
BitcoinDark, SysCoin, PotCoin, and Global Currency Reserve.
This book will be the first of its kind to dive deep into a
number of these. While many have slipped under the
11
12

mainstream radar, the opportunities they present may be just
as great as bitcoin.
We hope to transform today’s intelligent investor into an
innovative investor by providing a guide that explains what
cryptoassets are, why they should be considered, and how to
invest in them. Written by Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent
Investor is a seminal work on value investing that Warren
Buffet crowned as “the best book about investing ever
written.”  While we can only hope to achieve a fraction of the
success Graham had in educating investors, our goals are very
similar. We have chosen to focus on an asset class that didn’t
exist in Graham’s day, and one that serves as a nice hedge
against the exponential change that increasingly will disrupt
existing portfolios over time.
One of the keys to Graham’s book was always reminding
the investor to focus on the inherent value of an investment
without getting caught in the irrational behavior of the
markets. Just as he aimed to arm the intelligent investor with
the tools to make an investment decision based on
fundamental analysis, we hope to do the same for the
innovative investor who is considering adding cryptoassets to
his or her portfolio.
This is not a get-rich-quick book with the latest hot tips.
Rather it’s a book that grounds this new asset class in the
context of its own history, common investment strategies, the
history of financial speculation, and more. Investors who
follow through on their interest in cryptoassets and examine
them in the context of their overall financial goals and
portfolio strategies will become innovative investors.
We’ve written this book for the novice and the expert.
13

We’ve divided it into three parts: What, Why, and How. The
What lays the foundation for this new asset class, providing a
concise explanation of the technology and history of
cryptoassets. The Why dives into why portfolio management
matters, as well as why we think this is a whole new asset
class that offers great opportunity—as well as great risk. The
How details how to approach adding a cryptoasset to a
portfolio, including a framework for investigating the merits of
a new asset, and the logistical grit of acquisition, storage,
taxes, and regulation. Each chapter effectively can stand alone.
The world of cryptoassets may at times feel like science
fiction; we imagine that when the Internet was first explained
and discussed, people felt the same way. For many, change
sparks fear. We understand that. But it also kindles
opportunity, and we hope to prepare the reader to recognize,
understand, and act on the opportunities available in the world
of cryptoassets.
Tomorrow inevitably becomes today. Exponential change
isn’t going away. This book will help the innovative investor
not only survive but thrive. Let’s dive in.

Chapter 1
Bitcoin and the Financial
Crisis of 2008
n 2008, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of near
Wall Street collapse. In the four months of August to October
2008, an unprecedented series of changes occurred:
Bitcoin.org was registered, Lehman Brothers filed for the
largest bankruptcy in American history, Bank of America
bought Merrill Lynch for $50 billion, the U.S. government
established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP), and Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper that
founded Bitcoin and the basis of blockchain technology.
The entwinement of the financial collapse on the one hand
and the rise of Bitcoin on the other is hard to ignore. The
financial crisis cost the global economy trillions of dollars and
burned bridges of trust between financial titans and the
public.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin provided a system of
decentralized trust for value transfer, relying not on the ethics
of humankind but on the cold calculation of computers and
laying the foundation potentially to obviate the need for much
of Wall Street.

WHO IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO?
Referring to Satoshi as “he” is simply a matter of convenience
because to this day no one knows exactly who or even what
Satoshi is. He, she, they, or it remains totally anonymous. On a
profile page Satoshi created for the P2P Foundation—which
he used to communicate with others as he spun up Bitcoin—he
wrote that he was a 37-year-old male living in Japan.
Yet outside of Japan, fact digging has led people to believe
Satoshi resided in the United Kingdom, North America,
Central America, South America, or even the Caribbean.
People point to his impeccable written English or occasionally
British phrases as proof of U.K. residence,  while others cite
his posting patterns as being indicative of living in
geographies in Eastern or Central time zones.  A number of
phony Satoshis have appeared, too, as the media is all too
eager to present a solution to such a juicy puzzle. An
Australian, Craig Wright, claimed to be Satoshi in May 2016
and momentarily grabbed the attention of publications such as
The Economist  and Wired  before being debunked.
Claims of Satoshi’s origin now cover five continents,
leading us back to the possibility that maybe Satoshi isn’t even
a single person but rather a group of people. The mastery
Satoshi showcased across a wide scope of topics—including
cryptography, computer science, economics, and psychology
—and the ability to communicate it all fluidly seems to
support the hypothesis that Satoshi is more than one person.
But who would they be? While the mystery may never be
solved, Satoshi most certainly was aware of Wall Street’s
growing instability.

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008
For financial titans, 2008 proved a slowly unfolding
nightmare. In March of that year, the first major Wall Street
institution—Bear Stearns—acquiesced to its demons. After
weathering every type of market for 85 years, Bear Stearns
was finally dragged under by a slumping housing market. On
March 16, JPMorgan Chase & Co. bought it for $2 a share,
about 1 percent of the value of its $170 per share price from a
year prior.  To catalyze the deal, the Federal Reserve agreed to
facilitate the purchase of $29 billion in distressed assets from
Bear Stearns.  Yet disturbingly, a month after the buyout,
John Mack and Lloyd Blankfein, CEOs of Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., respectively, told
shareholders the housing market crisis was going to be short-
lived and nearing a close.
Much of this crisis was born of irresponsible lending,
known as subprime loans, to Americans who couldn’t repay
their debts. Historically, when a bank issued a loan, the bank
was on the hook for ensuring that the borrower repaid the
funds. However, in the case of many subprime loans, once
these loans were issued to borrowers, they were then
packaged, or securitized, into complex instruments known as
collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). These CMOs
were then sold to other investors, effectively passing on the
risk like a hot potato through the financial markets, with
purchasers lured by the promise of high returns combined with
low risk, due to purported diversification.
What people didn’t realize, including Wall Street
executives, was how deep and interrelated the risks CMOs
posed were. Part of the problem was that CMOs were complex
9
10
11

financial instruments supported by outdated financial
architecture that blended analog and digital systems. The lack
of seamless digital documentation made quantifying the risk
and understanding exactly what CMOs were composed of
difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, as these CMOs were
spread around the world, global investors were suddenly
interconnected in a web of American mortgages.  In the
summer of 2008, despite the lack of financial transparency but
emboldened by access to funds from the Federal Reserve in
case of further distress, Richard Fuld Jr., the CEO of Lehman
Brothers, eerily claimed, “We can’t fail now.”
As a storm brewed around unknowing Wall Street
executives, Satoshi Nakamoto was busy fleshing out the
concept of Bitcoin. On August 18, 2008, Bitcoin.org, the home
website for information on Bitcoin, was registered.  Whether
as an individual or an entity, what’s now clear is that Satoshi
was designing a technology that if existent would have likely
ameliorated the toxic opacity of CMOs. Due to the distributed
transparency and immutable audit log of a blockchain, each
loan issued and packaged into different CMOs could have
been documented on a single blockchain. This would have
allowed any purchaser to view a coherent record of CMO
ownership and the status of each mortgage within.
Unfortunately, in 2008 multiple disparate systems—which
were expensive and therefore poorly reconciled—held the
system together by digital strings.
On the morning of Wednesday, September 10, 2008, Fuld
and other senior management faced a different reality from
Fuld’s confident summer proclamation. Management
struggled to explain to a group of critical analysts $5.3 billion
12
13
14

worth of write-downs on “toxic assets” and a quarterly loss of
$3.9 billion.  The call ended abruptly, and analysts signed off
unconvinced of the measures Lehman was taking. The markets
had already punished Lehman the day before, dropping its
stock price 45 percent, and on Wednesday it dropped another 7
percent.
Two days later, on Friday afternoon, the CEOs of Merrill
Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs met at the New
York Federal Reserve, along with the Federal Reserve
Chairman, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, and the president of
the New York Federal Reserve. The afternoon’s topic was
what to do about Lehman Brothers. It was clear the situation
had become critical. Initially it appeared either Barclays or
Bank of America would come to the rescue of Lehman
Brothers, but that likelihood quickly evaporated.
On Saturday, as the same group met again at the New York
Fed, John Thain, Merrill Lynch’s CEO, had an unsettling
thought. During the briefing on Lehman’s situation, he
realized his company might only be a few steps from the same
catastrophe. “This could be me sitting here next Friday,”  he
said. Thain quickly moved to find suitors for Merrill, the most
promising option being Bank of America, which had already
been in talks to buy Lehman. With talks secretly progressing
between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, Lehman
Brothers held Barclays as its only suitor hope.
By Sunday, September 14, Barclays was ready to approve a
deal to buy Lehman Brothers. Lehman only needed the U.S. or
British government to back its trading balances for a couple of
days, enough time for Barclays to conduct a shareholder vote
for final approval. Neither government was willing to step in,
15
16
17

and the likelihood of a deal began to melt. With only a few
hours left until Asian markets opened for trading, the U.S.
government questioned Lehman on its only remaining option:
bankruptcy.
Harvey Miller, a well-regarded bankruptcy lawyer at Weil,
Gotshal & Manges, had been working quietly since Thursday
night to lay the groundwork for this worst-case bankruptcy
scenario. When asked by a senior Fed official if Mr. Miller felt
Lehman was ready to file for bankruptcy, he responded: “This
will cause financial Armageddon.”
If Lehman filed for bankruptcy, financial firms that did
business with Lehman would also lose billions, potentially
triggering a domino effect of bankruptcy.
Later that evening, Bank of America inked a deal to buy
Merrill Lynch for $50 billion, and a couple of hours later, in
the early hours of Monday morning, Lehman Brothers filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, making it the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. So came to an end a 164-year-old
firm born from a dry-goods store that had evolved into the
fourth largest U.S. investment bank. It signaled the end of an
era.
Lehman’s bankruptcy and Merrill’s buyout proved to be
only the beginning. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York was authorized to lend up to $85 billion to the
American International Group (AIG), the biggest insurer in
America, as the behemoth organization began to teeter.  It
was mid-September and darker clouds loomed on the horizon
for Wall Street and global financial markets.
THE BIRTH OF BITCOIN
18
19

Six and a half weeks later, on October 31, 2008, Satoshi
released the Bitcoin white paper, which serves as the genesis
for every single blockchain implementation deployed today
and forevermore. In the concluding paragraph of his
foundational paper, Satoshi wrote: “We have proposed a
system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.”
By the time he released the paper, he had already coded the
entire system. In his own words, “I had to write all the code
before I could convince myself that I could solve every
problem, then I wrote the paper.”  Based on historical
estimates, Satoshi likely started formalizing the Bitcoin
concept sometime in late 2006 and started coding it around
May 2007. In this same time span, many regulators began to
believe that the U.S. housing market was overextended and
likely in for a rough ride.  It’s hard to believe someone with
such breadth of knowledge as Satoshi would be working in
isolation from what he was witnessing in global financial
markets.
The day after publishing his white paper, Satoshi sent an
email to “The Cryptography Mailing List” with a link to his
paper.  The list was composed of subscribers focused on
cryptography and its potential applications. Satoshi’s email
sparked a chain of responses.
On Friday, November 7, 2008, in reply to his increasingly
passionate group of followers, he wrote: “You will not find a
solution to political problems in cryptography … but we can
win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of
freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off
the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but
pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding
20
21
22
23

their own.”  It’s clear from this quote that Satoshi was not
creating Bitcoin to slip seamlessly into the existing
governmental and financial system, but instead to be an
alternative system free of top-down control, governed by the
decentralized masses. Such decentralized autonomy was
foundational to the early days of the Internet as well, where
each node on the network was an autonomous agent that
corresponded with other agents through shared protocols.
On November 9, the Bitcoin project was registered on
SourceForge.net, a website geared toward facilitating open-
source software development. In response to a growing
number of inquiries and interest on The Cryptography Mailing
List, Satoshi wrote on November 17: “I’ll try and hurry up and
release the source code as soon as possible to serve as a
reference to help clear up all these implementation
questions.”
Then Satoshi went quiet for a couple months as Wall Street
continued to crumble. The Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 had done little to ameliorate the meltdown that
ensued after Lehman’s bankruptcy. Passed by Congress and
signed by President George W. Bush on October 3, the
emergency act had established the $700 billion TARP. As a
result of TARP, the U.S. government acquired preferred stock
in hundreds of banks as well as massive companies such as
AIG, General Motors, and Chrysler. The stock didn’t come for
free, though. It took $550 billion in investments to stabilize
those teetering mammoths.
In the opening moments of Bitcoin’s life as a public
network, Satoshi made clear he was attuned to the failings of
the global financial system. In the first instance of recording
24
25
26

information on Bitcoin’s blockchain, Satoshi inscribed: “The
Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout of
banks,”  in reference to an article that appeared in the British
publication The Times on the U.K.’s likely need to assist more
banks in staying afloat.  Many years later people would
realize that one of the most powerful use cases of blockchain
technology was to inscribe immutable and transparent
information that could never be wiped from the face of digital
history and that was free for all to see. Satoshi’s choice first to
employ this functionality by inscribing a note about bank
bailouts made it clear he was keen on never letting us forget
the failings of the 2008 financial crisis.
AN ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Nine days after this poignant inscription, the first ever
transaction using bitcoin took place between Satoshi
Nakamoto and Hal Finney, an early advocate and Bitcoin
developer. Nine months later the first exchange rate would be
set for bitcoin, valuing it at eight one-hundredths of a cent per
coin, or 1,309 bitcoin to the dollar.  A dollar invested then
would be worth over $1 million by the start of 2017,
underscoring the viral growth that the innovation was poised
to enjoy.
Diving deeper into Satoshi’s writings around the time, it
becomes more apparent that he was fixated on providing an
alternative financial system, if not a replacement entirely.
After the network had been up and running for over a month,
Satoshi wrote of Bitcoin, “It’s completely decentralized, with
no central server or trusted parties, because everything is
27
28
29

based on crypto proof instead of trust … I think this is the first
time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”
On December 5, 2010, Satoshi showed an unnervingly
human side, pleading that WikiLeaks not accept bitcoin as a
means of payment after major credit card networks had
blocked users from supporting the site. Satoshi wrote, “No,
don’t ‘bring it on’. The project needs to grow gradually so the
software can be strengthened along the way. I make this
appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a
small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to
get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring
would likely destroy us at this stage.”
Shortly thereafter, Satoshi vanished. Some speculate it was
for the good of Bitcoin. After all, being the creator of a
technology that has the potential to replace much of the
current financial system is bound eventually to invoke the
wrath of powerful government and private sector forces. By
disappearing into the ether, Satoshi removed the head of
Bitcoin, and with it a single point of failure. In his wake stands
a network with thousands of access points and millions of
users.
Wall Street, on the other hand, suffered from many points
of failure. When the dust settled, the U.S. government had
spent well beyond the $700 billion initially secured for TARP.
In all, $2.5 trillion was injected into the system, not to mention
$12.2 trillion committed to reinstall faith in the fidelity of
financial institutions.
While Wall Street as we knew it was experiencing an
expensive death, Bitcoin’s birth cost the world nothing. It was
born as an open-source technology and quickly abandoned like
30
31
32

a motherless babe in the world. Perhaps, if the global financial
system had been healthier, there would have been less of a
community to support Bitcoin, which ultimately allowed it to
grow into the robust and cantankerous toddler that it currently
is.
WELCOME TO THE WORLD THAT
BITCOIN CREATED
Since Satoshi disappeared, Bitcoin has unleashed a tidal wave
of disruption and rethinking of global financial and
technological systems. Countless derivations of Bitcoin have
been created—systems such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero,
and Zcash—all of which rely on blockchain technology,
Satoshi’s gift to the world. At the same time, many financial
and technological incumbents have moved to embrace the
technology, creating confusion around all the innovation
unfolding and what is most relevant to the innovative investor.
The next chapter will involve solidifying understanding of
blockchain technology, Bitcoin, bitcoin, cryptoassets, and
where the investment opportunities await.

Chapter 2
The Basics of Bitcoin and
Blockchain Technology
t’s time to crystallize the difference between Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s
blockchain, bitcoin with a lowercase b, blockchain technology,
and other related but distinct concepts. At first blush, this
space appears jargon heavy, deterring many from even
attempting to understand it. In reality, there are only a few
foreign concepts, encapsulated in recently invented words,
which unfortunately keep people out. Since these words are
used frequently when people talk about different applications
of Bitcoin or blockchain technology, the space appears
impenetrable—but it’s not. All that’s required is a concerted
effort to nail down the key concepts, which then become the
mental scaffolding that will support understanding of the many
applications of blockchain technology.
Bitcoin with an uppercase B refers to the software that
facilitates the transfer and custody of bitcoin the currency,
which starts with a lowercase b.
•   Bitcoin equals software.
•   bitcoin equals currency.

Much of this book will use Bitcoin (with a capital B) as the
starting point. Bitcoin is the genesis of the blockchain
movement. It is common to compare newly created
blockchains with Bitcoin’s because Bitcoin’s blockchain is the
longest standing point of reference. Therefore, understanding
the basics of Bitcoin is critical.
However, to truly understand Bitcoin, one has to move
beyond thinking of it as some digital Ponzi scheme or
shadowy system used by criminals. Those are stale stories that
continue to tumble through the media mill. In July 2016,
researchers from the London School of Economics and
Political Science, Deutsche Bundesbank (Germany’s central
bank), and the University of Wisconsin at Madison released
the paper “The Evolution of the Bitcoin Economy.” Three
reputable institutions would not waste their time, nor
jeopardize their reputations, on a nefarious currency with no
growth potential.
In that paper, the researchers describe an extensive analysis
they performed on Bitcoin’s blockchain and the transactions
therein. Below is a summary of what they found:
In this paper, we gather together the minimum units of Bitcoin identity (the
individual addresses), and group them into approximations of business
entities, what we call “super clusters.” While these clusters can remain
largely anonymous, we are able to ascribe many of them to particular
business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns,
as observed during the period from 2009–2015. We are then able to extract
and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and
analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. We conclude
by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin
economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second
growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e., gambling,
black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from
“sin” and toward legitimate enterprises.1

Certainly, some of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin were
criminals. But the same goes for most revolutionary
technologies, as new technologies are often useful tools for
those looking to outwit the law. We’ll get into the specific
risks associated with cryptoassets, including Bitcoin, in a later
chapter, but it’s clear that the story of bitcoin as a currency has
evolved beyond being solely a means of payment for illegal
goods and services. Over 100 media articles have jumped at
the opportunity to declare bitcoin dead,  and each time they
have been proven wrong.
When one considers Bitcoin neutrally in the context of a
broader theme of technological evolution, it sits in the sweet
spot of key technology trends. For example, the world is
increasingly real-time, with people connecting in peer-to-peer
manners, empowering and connecting individuals regardless
of geographic or socioeconomic birth. Bitcoin fits these
thematic molds. It allows a global transaction to be settled in
an hour as opposed to a couple of days. It operates in a peer-
to-peer manner, the same movement that has driven Uber,
Airbnb, and LendingClub to be multibillion-dollar companies
in their own realms. Bitcoin lets anyone be their own bank,
putting control in the hands of a grassroots movement and
empowering the globally unbanked.
However, Bitcoin has done something arguably more
impressive than Uber, Airbnb, and LendingClub. Those
companies decentralized services that were easily
understandable and had precedent for being peer-to-peer.
Everyone has had a friend drive them to the airport, or stayed
with a relative in another country, or borrowed money from
their parents. Decentralizing a currency, without a top-down
2

authority, requires coordinated global acceptance of a shared
means of payment and store of value.
Currency originally came about to facilitate trade, allowing
society to move past barter and the double coincidence of
wants. It has evolved over time to be more convenient,
resulting in its present paper state. Inherently, that paper has
little value other than the fact that everyone else thinks it has
value and the government requires it be accepted to fulfill
financial obligations. In that sense, it is a usefully shared
representation of value. The libertarians in the room would say
it’s a usefully shared illusion of value, going back to the idea
the paper itself is worth little. Bitcoin is a similarly shared
representation of value, except it has no physical manifestation
and no top-down authority to protect it. Despite these hurdles,
the elegance of the mathematics that allow it to function has
also allowed it to grow and store billions in value.
THE INNER WORKINGS OF BITCOIN’S
BLOCKCHAIN
Part of the Bitcoin software involves the building of Bitcoin’s
blockchain, which can be thought of as a digital ledger that
keeps track of user balances via debits and credits. In this
sense, Bitcoin’s blockchain is a database that records the flow
of its native currency, bitcoin. What makes this digital ledger
special?
Bitcoin’s blockchain is a distributed, cryptographic, and
immutable database that uses proof-of-work to keep the
ecosystem in sync. Technobabble? Sure. But impenetrable
technobabble? No.

Distributed
Distributed refers to the way in which computers access and
maintain Bitcoin’s blockchain. Unlike most databases that
rigidly control who can access the information within, any
computer in the world can access Bitcoin’s blockchain. This
feature of Bitcoin’s blockchain is integral to bitcoin as a global
currency. Since anyone anywhere can tap into Bitcoin’s
blockchain to see the record of debits and credits between
different accounts, it creates a system of global trust.
Everything is transparent, so everyone is on a level playing
field.
WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY?
Initially a scary word, cryptography is the science of
secure communication. It involves taking information and
scrambling it in such a way that only the intended recipient
can understand and use that information for its intended
purpose. The process of scrambling the message is
encryption, and unscrambling it is decryption, performed
through complex mathematical techniques.
Cryptography is the battlefield on which those trying to
transmit information securely combat those attempting to
decrypt or manipulate the information. More recently,
cryptography has evolved to include applications like
proving the ownership of information to a broader set of
actors—such as public key cryptography—which is a large
part of how cryptography is used within Bitcoin.
Encryption techniques have been employed for
centuries. Julius Caesar used a simple method of
encryption during times of war to inform his generals of

his plans. He would send messages using letters that were
three letters after the letter they were supposed to
represent. For instance, instead of using the letters ABC in
his message, he would write them as DEF and his generals
would decrypt them to understand his intended message.
Understandably, this form of encryption did not remain
secure for long.
A more recent example that was the subject of the
movie The Imitation Game was the effort during World
War II of a group of English cryptographers to decode the
messages of Nazi Germany, which were encrypted by a
coding device called the Enigma machine. Alan Turing, a
luminary in machine learning and artificial intelligence,
was a major player on the team whose efforts to break the
Enigma code ultimately had a debilitating impact on
German war strategies and helped to end the war.
Cryptography has become a vital part of our lives.
Every time we type in a password, pay with a credit card,
or use WhatsApp, we are enjoying the benefits of
cryptography. Without cryptography, it would be easy for
bad actors to steal sensitive information and use it against
us. Cryptography makes sure the information can only be
used by those for whom it is intended.
Cryptographic
Every transaction recorded in Bitcoin’s blockchain must be
cryptographically verified to ensure that people trying to send
bitcoin actually own the bitcoin they’re trying to send.
Cryptography also applies to how groups of transactions are
added to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Transactions are not added one
3

at a time, but instead in “blocks” that are “chained” together,
hence the term blockchain. We will go deeper into the
specifics of the process in the proof-of-work section that
follows, but for now here’s the takeaway: cryptography allows
the computers building Bitcoin’s blockchain to collaborate in
an automated system of mathematical trust. There is no
subjectivity as to whether a transaction is confirmed in
Bitcoin’s blockchain: it’s just math. For a deep dive on
cryptography, we highly recommend The Code Book: The
Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum
Cryptography by Simon Singh.
Immutable
The combination of globally distributed computers that can
cryptographically verify transactions and the building of
Bitcoin’s blockchain leads to an immutable database, meaning
the computers building Bitcoin’s blockchain can only do so in
an append only fashion. Append only means that information
can only be added to Bitcoin’s blockchain over time but
cannot be deleted—an audit trail etched in digital granite.
Once information is confirmed in Bitcoin’s blockchain, it’s
permanent and cannot be erased. Immutability is a rare feature
in a digital world where things can easily be erased, and it will
likely become an increasingly valuable attribute for Bitcoin
over time.
Proof-of-Work
While the previous three attributes are valuable, none of them
is inherently new. Proof-of-work (PoW) ties together the
concepts of a distributed, cryptographic, and immutable

database, and is how the distributed computers agree on which
group of transactions will be appended to Bitcoin’s blockchain
next. Put another way, PoW specifically deals with how
transactions are grouped in blocks, and how those blocks are
chained together, to make Bitcoin’s blockchain.
The computers—or miners as they’re called—use PoW to
compete with one another to get the privilege to add blocks of
transactions to Bitcoin’s blockchain, which is how transactions
are confirmed. Each time miners add a block, they get paid in
bitcoin for doing so, which is why they choose to compete in
the first place.
Competition for a financial reward is also what keeps
Bitcoin’s blockchain secure. If any ill-motivated actors wanted
to change Bitcoin’s blockchain, they would need to compete
with all the other miners distributed globally who have in total
invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the machinery
necessary to perform PoW. The miners compete by searching
for the solution to a cryptographic puzzle that will allow them
to add a block of transactions to Bitcoin’s blockchain.
The solution to this cryptographic puzzle involves
combining four variables: the time, a summary of the proposed
transactions, the identity of the previous block, and a variable
called the nonce.
The nonce is a random number that when combined with
the other three variables via what is called a cryptographic
hash function results in an output that fits a difficult criteria.
The difficulty of meeting this criteria is defined by a parameter
that is adjusted dynamically so that one miner finds a solution
to this mathematical puzzle roughly every 10 minutes. If all of
this seems like drinking water out of a fire hose, that’s okay—

it’s that way for everyone at the outset. We’ll cover this
process in greater detail in Chapter 4, and then go even deeper
in Chapter 14.
The most important part of the PoW process is that one of
the four variables is the identity of the previous block, which
includes when that block was created, its set of transactions,
the identity of the block before that, and the block’s nonce. If
innovative investors keep following this logic, they will realize
that this links every single block in Bitcoin’s blockchain
together. As a result, no information in any past block, even if
it was created years ago, can be changed without changing all
of the blocks after it. Such a change would be rejected by the
distributed set of miners, and this property is what makes
Bitcoin’s blockchain and the transactions therein immutable.
Miners are economically rewarded for creating a new block
with a transaction that grants them newly minted bitcoin,
called a coinbase transaction, as well as fees for each
transaction. The coinbase transaction is also what slowly
releases new bitcoin into the money supply, but more on that
later.
A USEFUL ANALOGY FOR BITCOIN’S
ECOSYSTEM
To tie everything together using an analogy that will prepare
us for a discussion of the applications of blockchain
technology in Chapter 3 (see Figure 2.1). It’s helpful to think
of the concepts as a stack of hardware, software, applications,
and users in relation to a personal computer.

Figure 2.1 
 Bitcoin as a stack of hardware, OS, applications, and end users
The miners that build Bitcoin’s blockchain with the PoW
process are the hardware, just as a MacBook Pro provides the
hardware for a personal computer. That hardware runs an
operating system (OS); in the case of Bitcoin, the operating
system is the open-source software that facilitates everything
described earlier. This software is developed by a volunteer
group of developers, just as Linux, the operating system that
underlies much of the cloud, is maintained by a volunteer
group of developers. On top of this hardware and operating
system combination are applications, just as Safari is an
application that runs on an Apple operating system. The
applications interface with the Bitcoin operating system,
which pushes and pulls information to and from Bitcoin’s
blockchain as needed. Lastly, there are the end users that
interface with the applications, and someday may have no
concept of the hardware or software underneath because all
they need to know is how to navigate the applications.
PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC

BLOCKCHAINS
Broadly, there are two types of entities that can own the
hardware supporting blockchains: public and private. The
difference between public and private blockchains is similar to
that between the Internet and intranets. The Internet is a public
resource. Anyone can tap into it; there’s no gatekeeper.
Intranets, on the other hand, are walled gardens used by
companies or consortiums to transmit private information.
Public blockchains are analogous to the Internet, whereas
private blockchains are like intranets. While both are useful
today, there’s little debate that the Internet has created orders
of magnitude more value than intranets. This is despite
vociferous proclamations by incumbents in the 1980s and
1990s that the public Internet could never be trusted. History is
on the side of public networks, and while history doesn’t
repeat, it does often rhyme.
The important distinction boils down to how the entities get
access to the network. Remember, a blockchain is created by a
distributed system of computers that uses cryptography and a
consensus process to keep the members of the community in
sync. A blockchain is useless in isolation; one might as well
use a centralized database. The community of computers
building a blockchain can either be public or private,
commonly referred to as permissionless or permissioned.
Public systems are ones like Bitcoin, where anyone with the
right hardware and software can connect to the network and
access the information therein. There is no bouncer checking
IDs at the door. Rather, participation in the network forms an
economic equilibrium in which entities will buy more
hardware to take part in building Bitcoin’s blockchain if they
4

feel they can make money doing so. Other examples of public
blockchains include Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, and
so on, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapters 4 and
5.
Private systems, on the other hand, employ a bouncer at the
door. Only entities that have the proper permissions can
become part of the network. These private systems came about
after Bitcoin did, when enterprises and businesses realized
they liked the utility of Bitcoin’s blockchain, but weren’t
comfortable or legally allowed to be as open with the
information propagated among public entities.
These private blockchains have thus far been most widely
embraced by the financial services as a means to update IT
architecture that hasn’t had a major facelift since preparation
for the Y2K bug. Within financial services, these private
blockchains are largely solutions by incumbents in a fight to
remain incumbents. While there is merit to many of these
solutions, some claim the greatest revolution has been getting
large and secretive entities to work together, sharing
information and best practices, which will ultimately lower the
cost of services to the end consumer.  We believe that over
time the implementation of private blockchains will erode the
position held by centralized powerhouses because of the
tendency toward open networks. In other words, it’s a foot in
the door for further decentralization and the use of public
blockchains.
The potential applications of private blockchains extend far
beyond the financial services industry. Banks and other
monetary intermediaries have most quickly moved to adopt
the technology because the use cases are most obvious for a
5

system that specializes in securing transactions. Beyond the
financial services industry, others that are exploring the
applications of blockchain technology include the music
industry, real estate, insurance, healthcare, networking,
polling, supply chains, charities, gun tracking, law
enforcement, governments, and more.
Throughout this book, we will focus on public blockchains
and their native assets, or what we will define as cryptoassets,
because we believe this is where the greatest opportunity
awaits the innovative investor. Sometimes, cryptoassets have
the exact same name as their parent blockchain but with
different capitalization. Other times there’s a slightly different
name for the asset. For example, the native asset of Bitcoin’s
blockchain is bitcoin, the native asset of Ethereum’s
blockchain is ether, the native asset of Litecoin’s blockchain is
litecoin, etc.
Many public blockchains are markedly different from one
another. Some members of the early Bitcoin community feel
the definition of what makes something a blockchain should
be very specific, in particular, that any blockchain must use
proof-of-work as the means of consensus. We disagree with
that exclusive worldview, as there are many other interesting
consensus mechanisms being developed, such as proof-of-
stake, proof-of-existence, proof-of-elapsed-time, and so on.
Just as machine learning is not just one thing, but composed of
the Symbolists, Connectionists, Evolutionaries, Bayesians, and
Analogizers, so too can blockchain technology have many
flavors. In The Master Algorithm,  Pedro Domingos
hypothesizes that all these camps of machine learning—which
at times have been bitter rivals—will one day coalesce. The
6
7

same will likely be true of blockchain technology. If these
distributed databases of value are to be truly transformational,
they will have to interoperate and value one another.
THE MANY USES OF THE WORD BLOCKCHAIN
Despite increased interest in blockchain technology,
confusion remains as to what it specifically means due to
imprecision in the use of the term. For example, “a
blockchain,” “the blockchain,” “blockchain,” and
“blockchain technology” can all refer to different things.
Typically, when people say the blockchain, they are
referring to the original, or Bitcoin’s blockchain. At the
risk of redundancy but in pursuit of clarity, we will always
use “Bitcoin’s blockchain” instead of “the blockchain.”
On the other hand, terms such as a blockchain and
blockchain technology typically refer to derivatives of the
original that now may have nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, blockchain is normally used to refer to the
concept itself, with no particular implementation in mind.
It is the most amorphous, so our least favored of the terms.

I
Chapter 3
“Blockchain, Not Bitcoin?”
n drawing a line between public and private blockchains, we
have entered contentious territory that the innovative investor
should understand. The difference between these two types of
blockchains and the groups that support them is full of tension,
because the two camps have different goals for the technology.
At the risk of overgeneralizing, private blockchains are backed
by incumbents in their respective industries, while public
blockchains are backed by the disruptors.
To round out the context within which the innovative
investor approaches cryptoassets, it’s important to understand
how the world evolved beyond a single blockchain—Bitcoin’s
blockchain—to include public and private blockchains.
Otherwise, investors may be confused when they hear
someone claim that Bitcoin is no longer relevant or that it’s
been displaced. Neither of these claims is true, but it’s
nonetheless helpful to understand the motivations and
rationale behind those that say they are.
BITCOIN’S EARLY YEARS

We left Bitcoin in Chapter 1 with Satoshi pleading on
December 5, 2010, for WikiLeaks not to accept bitcoin for
donations to its site, because bitcoin was still too young and
vulnerable to attack. This was about two years after the birth
of Bitcoin’s blockchain, during which it had lived a mostly
quiet and nerdy life. That was all about to change.
A few months after Satoshi’s plea, a software application
was released that would make Bitcoin famous. Launched in
February 2011, the Silk Road provided a rules-free
decentralized marketplace for any product one could imagine,
and it used bitcoin as the means of payment. You name it, the
Silk Road had it. Gawker put it succinctly in a June 2011
article, “The Underground Website Where You Can Buy Any
Drug Imaginable.”  Clearly, this was one way that Bitcoin
developed its dark reputation, though it’s important to know
that this was not endorsed by Bitcoin and its development
team. The Silk Road was simply making use of this new
digital and decentralized currency by building an application
atop its platform.
The Gawker article led to the first Google search spike in
Bitcoin’s life, as shown in Figure 3.1, and would drive the
price of bitcoin from about $10 to $30 in the span of a week.
However, the Gawker article jump paled in comparison to the
global Google search volume in March to April 2013, which
corresponded with a nearly eightfold increase in price, from
roughly $30 to $230 in about a month. The drivers behind this
bitcoin demand were more opaque than the Gawker spike,
though many point to the bailout of Cyprus and the associated
losses that citizens took on their bank account balances as the
core driver. Bitcoin received ample interest for being outside
1
2

of government control, making its holders immune to such
events. Bloomberg ran a story on March 25, 2013, with the
eye-catching title, “Bitcoin May Be the Global Economy’s
Last Safe Haven.”
Figure 3.1

While the spring of 2013 was notable, it was a preview for
bitcoin’s grand opening to global attention. This came six
months later, in November 2013, when increased demand for
bitcoin in China along with interest from the U.S. Senate on
the innovation led to a stratospheric ascent through $1,000 that
grabbed international headlines.
THE UTILITY OF GOOGLE SEARCH TRENDS
Google search trends are a useful indicator of what is
grabbing mainstream attention. The innovative investor
can go to https://trends.google.com/ and explore the
patterns of how people are searching for different topics.
3
4

Google even provides the option to explore search trends
by geographical location, giving charts of where interest is
spiking, as well as showing what related topics are on the
rise. For example, after typing in “bitcoin,” investors can
look at Google search trends for the last year, or five years,
or a custom range, and investigate how Nigeria differs
from India. We recommend orienting with this tool even
beyond cryptoassets, as it’s a fascinating window into the
global mesh of minds.
At this point, bitcoin’s spike captured the attention of the
People’s Bank of China, which promptly implemented
restrictions on bitcoin’s use, declaring it was “not a currency
in the real meaning of the word.”  The China ruling, combined
with the FBI’s capture of the creator of the Silk Road, Ross
Ulbricht,  and soon thereafter the collapse of the biggest
exchange at the time, Mt. Gox,  put many bitcoin investors on
edge as to its long-term viability in the face of government and
law enforcement crackdowns.  Bitcoin’s subsequent price
descent through all of 2014, bottoming in January 2015, was
volatile, prolonged, and dispiriting for many early adopters
who had been drawn to the new concept.
While bitcoin’s price was declining, its developers plowed
forward with improving the protocol and building applications
atop it. During that time, conversations about the underlying
technology gained momentum, as early Bitcoiners
emphasized that Bitcoin was important not only because of the
decentralized currency aspect but also because of the
architecture that supported it. This emphasis on the technology
supporting Bitcoin came about just as a slew of developers and
enterprises began to investigate Bitcoin because of the
5
6
7
8
9

headlines that had grabbed their attention. Clearly, something
was going on, and newcomers to the technology were trying to
figure out what.
The trifecta of current Bitcoiners defending and explaining
the disruptive potential of Bitcoin’s technology, bitcoin’s price
descending dramatically, and newcomers investigating the
technology led to a seismic shift in the Bitcoin narrative.
Newcomers didn’t necessarily see the need for bitcoin in the
ways in which they wanted to use blockchain technology, and
they felt reaffirmed in their belief by the continued descent of
bitcoin’s price through 2014. But to Bitcoiners it had always
been “bitcoin and blockchain.” The asset, bitcoin, was what
incentivized an ecosystem of players—miners, developers,
companies, and users—to secure and build upon Bitcoin’s
blockchain, delivering means of exchange and store of value
services to the world.
Out of this examination of the technology underlying
Bitcoin, two movements exploded in the blockchain
technology space. One was the proliferation of new
cryptoassets that supported new public blockchains, like
Ethereum. These new public blockchains offered utility
outside the realm of Bitcoin. For example, Ethereum’s goal
was to serve as a decentralized world computer, whereas
Bitcoin aimed to be a decentralized world currency. This
diversity has led to tension among players as some of these
cryptoassets compete, but this is nothing like the tension that
exists between Bitcoin and the second movement.
The second movement that exploded on the scene
questioned whether bitcoin, or any cryptoasset, was necessary
to get the value out of blockchain technology. It is this second

movement that we will investigate further in this chapter, as
it’s important for the innovative investor to understand why
some people will claim bitcoin and other cryptoassets aren’t
needed to keep their implementations secure and functioning:
welcome to the world of private blockchains.
SATOSHI NEVER SAID BLOCKCHAIN
The word blockchain was not mentioned once in Satoshi’s
2008 white paper. It was early Bitcoin companies that
popularized the word within what was then a niche
community. For example, blockchain.info, a popular
Bitcoin wallet service,  was launched in August 2011.
Satoshi, on the other hand, frequently referred to the
system as a “proof-of-work chain.” The closest he came to
saying blockchain was with phrases such as “blocks are
chained” or a “chain of blocks.” Since Satoshi only places
“proof-of-work” directly before “chain,” many early
Bitcoiners are adamant that the term blockchain should
only be used if it is proof-of-work based. Remember that
proof-of-work is a mechanism whereby all the computers
building Bitcoin’s blockchain remain in sync on how to
construct it.
BLOCKCHAIN, NOT BITCOIN
Articles like one from the Bank of England in the third quarter
of 2014 argued, “The key innovation of digital currencies is
the ‘distributed ledger,’ which allows a payment system to
operate in an entirely decentralized way, without
intermediaries such as banks.”  In emphasizing the
10
11

technology and not the native asset, the Bank of England left
an open question whether the native asset was needed.
At the Inside Bitcoins conference in April 2015,  many
longtime Bitcoiners commented on how many Wall Street
suits were in attendance. While Bitcoin was still king, there
were growing whispers of “blockchain not bitcoin,” which was
heresy to Bitcoiners.
The term blockchain, independent of Bitcoin, began to be
used more widely in North America in the fall of 2015 when
two prominent financial magazines catalyzed awareness of the
concept. First, Bloomberg Markets published an article titled
“Blythe Masters Tells Banks the Blockchain Changes
Everything: The banker who helped give the world credit-
default swaps wants to upend finance again—this time with
the code that powers bitcoin.”  In emphasizing “the code that
powers bitcoin,” this article quietly questioned the need for the
native asset, instead emphasizing the underlying technology.
Masters was a well-known and respected figure in financial
services, one that people associated with financial innovation.
Her choice to join a little-known firm at the time called Digital
Asset Holdings, after having been the head of global
commodities at JPMorgan Chase, was reason to believe that
blockchain technology was no longer on the fringe of the
business world. In the article, a quote from Masters brought
everyone to attention: “You should be taking this technology
as seriously as you should have been taking the development
of the Internet in the early 1990s. It’s analogous to email for
money.”
The October 31, 2015, issue of the Economist featured
“The Trust Machine” on its front cover, and while the article
12
13

tipped its hat to Bitcoin, its focus was the more broadly
applicable “technology behind bitcoin” and used the term
blockchain throughout.
The combination of Masters, Bloomberg, and the
Economist led to a spike in interest in blockchain technology
that set off a sustained climb in global Google search volumes
for “blockchain” that is still in an upward trend. In the two
weeks between October 18 and November 1, 2015, just after
Bloomberg and the Economist published their articles, global
Google search volumes for “blockchain” grew 70 percent (see
Figure 3.2).
Figure 3.2

from Google Search Trends
Masters’s focus for blockchain technology in financial
services is on private blockchains, which are very different
14

from Bitcoin’s blockchain. Pivotal to the current conversation,
private blockchains don’t need native assets. Since access to
the network is tightly controlled—largely maintaining security
through exclusivity—the role of computers supporting the
blockchain is different.  Since these computers don’t have to
worry about attack from the outside—they are operating
behind a firewall and collaborating with known entities—it
removes the need for a native asset that incentivizes the build-
out of a robust network of miners.
A private blockchain is typically used to expedite and make
existing processes more efficient, thereby rewarding the
entities that have crafted the software and maintain the
computers. In other words, the value creation is in the cost
savings, and the entities that own the computers enjoy these
savings. The entities don’t need to get paid in a native asset as
reward for their work, as is the case with public blockchains.
On the other hand, for Bitcoin to incentivize a self-selecting
group of global volunteers, known as miners, to deploy capital
into the mining machines that validate and secure bitcoin
transactions, there needs to be a native asset that can be paid
out to the miners for their work. The native asset builds out
support for the service from the bottom up in a truly
decentralized manner. Public blockchains are not so much
databases as they are system architectures spawned from the
bottom up to orchestrate the creation of globally decentralized
digital services. Over time, miner compensation will shift from
the issuance of new bitcoin to transaction fees, and if global
adoption is great enough, then transaction fees will be
sufficient to sustain miners.
The kernel of belief held by many avid proponents of
15

private blockchains is that the native assets themselves (such
as bitcoin) are irrelevant; they can be removed from the
architecture and the best parts of the technology can remain
intact. For the use cases these people are pursuing, that’s true.
For public blockchains, however, it’s not true. Enterprises that
have come to explore blockchain technology from the
perspective of how they can use it to update their current
technology stacks, very much in the form of a database, most
often fall into the private blockchain bucket. Many financial
services companies are the earliest adopters of this mindset.
Beyond questioning the need for native cryptoassets—
which would naturally infuriate communities that very much
value their cryptoassets—tensions also exist because public
blockchain advocates believe the private blockchain
movement bastardizes the ethos of blockchain technology. For
example, instead of aiming to decentralize and democratize
aspects of the existing financial services, Masters’s Digital
Asset Holdings aims to assist existing financial services
companies in adopting this new technology, thereby helping
the incumbents fight back the rebels who seek to disrupt the
status quo.
BLOCKCHAINS AS A GENERAL
PURPOSE TECHNOLOGY
While we have our beliefs about the most exciting applications
of blockchain technology, we don’t ascribe to an exclusive
world view. Instead, we believe Bitcoin’s blockchain is one of
the most important blockchains in existence, and that it has
given birth to a new general purpose technology that goes

beyond Bitcoin.
General purpose technologies are pervasive, eventually
affecting all consumers and companies. They improve over
time in line with the deflationary progression of technology,
and most important, they are a platform upon which future
innovations are built. Some of the more famous examples
include steam, electricity, internal combustion engines, and
information technology.  We would add blockchain
technology to this list. While such a claim may appear grand
to some, that is the scale of the innovation before us.
As a general purpose technology, blockchain technology
includes private blockchains that are going to have a profound
impact on many industries and public blockchains beyond
Bitcoin that are growing like gangbusters. The realm of public
blockchains and their native assets is most relevant to the
innovative investor, as private blockchains have not yielded an
entirely new asset class that is investable to the public.
WHERE IS BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
IN THE HYPE CYCLE?
By now it will be clear to the innovative investor that the
blockchain technology space is still working itself out and will
continue to do so for years to come. Captivating technologies
have a gravitational pull that brings in new minds with varied
perspectives and that will push the boundaries of the
technology.
The progression of a new technology, and the way it
evolves as it gains mental mindshare, is at the core of
Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies (Gartner is
16

a leading technology research and advisory firm),  which
displays five common stages of technology.
•   Innovation Trigger
•   Peak of Inflated Expectations
•   Trough of Disillusionment
•   Slope of Enlightenment
•   Plateau of Productivity
First is the Innovation Trigger that brings the technology into
the world. While not very visible, just as Bitcoin wasn’t
visible in the early years of its life, word spreads and
expectations grow. Over time the murmurs gain momentum,
building into a crescendo that is Gartner’s second stage, the
Peak of Inflated Expectations. The peak represents the height
of confusion around the definition of the original technology,
because people often apply it optimistically to everything they
see. No technology is a panacea.
As companies sprout to life and attempt to transition ideas
into reality, shifting from proof-of-concepts to at-scale
implementations, it frequently turns out that implementing a
new disruptive technology in the wild is much harder than
anticipated. The new technology must integrate with many
other systems, often requiring a wide-reaching redesign. It also
requires retraining of employees and consumers. These
difficulties slowly push the technology into the Trough of
Disillusionment, as people lament that this technology will
never work or is too difficult to deal with.
When enough people have given up, but the loyal keep
working in dedication, the technology begins to rise again, this
time not with the irrational exuberance of its early years, but
17
18

instead with a sustained release of improvements and
productivity. Over time the technology matures, ultimately
becoming a steady platform in the Plateau of Productivity that
provides a base on which to build other technologies.
While it’s hard to predict where blockchain technology
currently falls on Gartner’s Hype Cycle (these things are
always easier in retrospect), we would posit that Bitcoin is
emerging from the Trough of Disillusionment. At the same
time, blockchain technology stripped of native assets (private
blockchain) is descending from the Peak of Inflated
Expectations, which it reached in the summer of 2016 just
before The DAO hack occurred (which we will discuss in
detail in Chapter 5).
Cryptoassets beyond bitcoin are at different points between
the Innovation Trigger and the Trough of Disillusionment.
These differ because they came to life at different points after
bitcoin and many are still emerging. Suffice it to say, the
promise is great, the tensions are high, and opportunity awaits
the innovative investor. Let’s now take a tour of the various
cryptoassets that currently exist.

A
Chapter 4
The Taxonomy of
Cryptoassets
s we’ve seen, bitcoin ignited the cryptoasset revolution, and its
success has led to the birth of numerous other permissionless
(public) blockchains with their own native cryptoassets. We
also refer to these as bitcoin’s digital siblings. As of March
2017, there were over 800 cryptoassets with a fascinating
family tree, accruing to a total network value  of over $24
billion.  At the time, bitcoin was the largest and most widely
transacted of these assets by a wide margin, with a network
value of $17 billion, accounting for nearly 70 percent of the
total network value of cryptoassets. The next largest
cryptoasset by network value was Ethereum’s ether at over $4
billion. Yes, the numbers have changed a lot since. Crypto
moves fast.
As the investment landscape for cryptoassets continues to
grow beyond bitcoin, it’s vital for the innovative investor to
understand the historical context, categorization, and
applicability of these digital siblings, so that potential
investment opportunities can be identified. To this end, we aim
1
2

to provide a historical grounding of who and what led to the
creation of many notable cryptoassets. Through this process,
we will also introduce more detailed concepts that will go into
the innovative investor’s toolset when investigating future
cryptoassets.
CRYPTOCURRENCIES,
CRYPTOCOMMODITIES, AND
CRYPTOTOKENS
Historically, cryptoassets have most commonly been referred
to as cryptocurrencies, which we think confuses new users and
constrains the conversation on the future of these assets. We
would not classify the majority of cryptoassets as currencies,
but rather most are either digital commodities
(cryptocommodities), provisioning raw digital resources, or
digital tokens (cryptotokens), provisioning finished digital
goods and services.
A currency fulfills three well-defined purposes: to serve as
a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.
However, the form of currency itself often has little inherent
value. For example, the paper bills in people’s wallets have
about as little value as the paper in their printer. Instead, they
have the illusion of value, which if shared widely enough by
society and endorsed by the government, allows these
monetary bills to be used to buy goods and services, to store
value for later purchases, and to serve as a metric to price the
value of other things.
Meanwhile, commodities are wide-ranging and most
commonly thought of as raw material building blocks that

serve as inputs into finished products. For example, oil, wheat,
and copper are all common commodities. However, to assume
that a commodity must be physical ignores the overarching
“offline to online” transition occurring in every sector of the
economy. In an increasingly digital world, it only makes sense
that we have digital commodities, such as compute power,
storage capacity, and network bandwidth.
While compute, storage, and bandwidth are not yet widely
referred to as commodities, they are building blocks that are
arguably just as important as our physical commodities, and
when provisioned via a blockchain network, they are most
clearly defined as cryptocommodities.
Beyond cryptocurrencies and cryptocommodities—and also
provisioned via blockchain networks—are “finished-product”
digital goods and services like media, social networks, games,
and more, which are orchestrated by cryptotokens. Just as in
the physical world, where currencies and commodities fuel an
economy to create finished goods and services, so too in the
digital world the infrastructures provided by cryptocurrencies
and cryptocommodities are coming together to support the
aforementioned finished-product digital goods and services.
Cryptotokens are in the earliest stage of development, and will
likely be the last to gain traction as they require a robust
cryptocurrency and cryptocommodity infrastructure to be built
before they can reliably function.
In summation, we believe that a clearer view of this brave
new world of blockchain architecture includes
cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, and cryptotokens, just as
we have had currencies, commodities, and finished goods and
services in the preceding centuries. Be it a currency,

commodity, or service, blockchain architectures help provision
these digital resources in a distributed and market-based
manner.
In this chapter, we focus on the most important
cryptocurrencies today, including bitcoin, litecoin, ripple,
monero, dash, and zcash. The next chapter covers the world of
cryptocommodities and cryptotokens, the development of
which has been accelerated by the launch of Ethereum and its
value proposition as a decentralized world computer. Besides
its status as the number two cryptoasset by network value,
Ethereum has also spawned many other cryptoassets that
creatively utilize its network.
While we cannot possibly cover all the cryptoassets, we
will focus on those we believe will help the innovative
investor gain the broadest perspective. To those entrepreneurs
and developers who’ve created assets that we’re unable to
cover here, we apologize. Many amazing projects were created
in the process of writing the book, and if we tried to
incorporate them all the book would never have been finished.
To that end, we’ve included a listing in the resources section
to enable access to information on other cryptoassets.
WHY CRYPTO?
Sometimes the word crypto makes people shudder,
perhaps because they associate it with illicit activity, but
that’s a mental bias that is important to overcome. Crypto
is simply a tip of the hat to and a shortening of the key
technology underlying these systems: cryptography. As
discussed in Chapter 2, cryptography is the science of
securely transmitting data so that only intended recipients

can make use of it. Cryptography is used to ensure that
cryptoassets are transferred to the intended recipients
securely. Given our digital world and the increasing
prevalence of hacks, the secure transmission of resources
is paramount, and cryptoassets have such security in
spades.
THE EVER-EVOLVING NATURE OF
CURRENCIES
The pursuit of a decentralized, private, and digital currency
predates bitcoin by decades. Bitcoin and its digital siblings are
just part of a broader evolution of currencies that has taken
place over centuries. At their inception, currencies were a
solution to ease the impreciseness of barter trade, and for
centuries metal coins with material value served as the
currencies of choice. Fiat currency was an innovation beyond
metal coins, as it was much easier to transport, but the entirety
of its value relied upon the government’s stamp of approval
and mandate of legal tender. We believe that currency void of
any physical representation is the next phase of the evolution,
and in our Internet-tethered world an inevitable one.
As innovations underlying the Internet gained steam, so too
did the realization that we would need a secure form of digital
payment. One of Bitcoin’s most famous ancestors was
pioneered by a company called DigiCash, led by David
Chaum, who remains one of the most famous cryptographers
in cryptoasset history. In 1993, prior to Marc Andressen
founding Netscape, Chaum invented the digital payment
system called ecash. This allowed secure and anonymous

payments across the Internet, no matter the amount.
Clearly, Chaum’s timing could not have been better given
the tech boom that followed through the mid-to late-1990s,
and his company, DigiCash, had several opportunities for
growth, any of which might have made it a household name.
However, while Chaum was widely regarded as a technical
genius, as a businessperson he left much to be desired. Bill
Gates approached Chaum about integrating ecash into
Windows 95, which would have immediately given it global
distribution, but Chaum refused what was rumored to be a
$100 million offer. Similarly, Netscape made initial inquiries
about a relationship, but management was quickly turned off
by Chaum’s attitude. In 1996, Visa wanted to invest $40
million into the company but were dissuaded when Chaum
demanded $75 million (if these reports are correct, it’s clear
that the potential price for Chaum’s creation was dropping).
If all had gone well, DigiCash’s ecash would have been
integrated into all our web browsers at the ground floor,
serving as the global Internet payment mechanism and
potentially removing the need for credit cards in online
payments. Sadly, mismanagement ultimately ran DigiCash
into the ground, and in 1998 it declared bankruptcy. While
DigiCash failed to become a household name, some players
will resurface in our story, such as Nick Szabo, the father of
“smart contracts,” and Zooko Wilcox, the founder of Zcash,
both of whom worked at DigiCash for a time.
Other attempts were made at digital currencies, payment
systems, or stores of value after ecash, like e-gold and Karma.
The former ran into trouble with the FBI for serving a criminal
element,  while the latter never gained mainstream adoption.

The pursuit of a new form of Internet money drew the
attention of present day tech-titans such as Peter Thiel and
Elon Musk, both of whom had a hand in founding PayPal.
Except for Karma, the problem with all these attempts at
digital money was that they weren’t purely decentralized—one
way or another they relied on a centralized entity, and that
presented the opportunity for corruption and weak points for
attack.
THE MIRACLE OF BITCOIN
One of the most miraculous aspects of bitcoin is how it
bootstrapped support in a decentralized manner. The
importance, and difficulty, of being the first currency to do so
cannot be emphasized enough. Until people understand how
bitcoin works, they often argue that it has no value as currency
because, unlike what they’re used to, you can’t see it, touch it,
or smell it.
Paper currency has value because it is mutually agreed
upon by members of society that it has value. It’s much easier
for society to agree to this with a government involved.
Getting a global society to agree that something has value and
can be used as a currency without government support and
without a physical form is one of the most significant
accomplishments in monetary history.
When bitcoin was launched, it had zero value in the sense
that it could be used to purchase nothing. The earliest adopters
and supporters subjectively valued bitcoin because it was a
fascinating computer science and game theory experiment. As
the utility of Bitcoin’s blockchain proved itself a reliable

facilitator of Money-over-Internet-Protocol (MoIP),  use cases
began to be built using bitcoin, some of which now include
facilitating e-commerce, remittances, and international
business-to-business payments.
Concurrent with the early development of use cases,
investors started to speculate on what future use cases would
look like and how much bitcoin those use cases would require.
Together, the combination of current use cases and investors
buying bitcoin based on the expectation for even greater future
use cases creates market demand for bitcoin. How much is a
buyer willing to pay for something (the bid), and how much is
a seller willing to receive to part with that item (the ask)? As
with any market, where the bid and ask meet is where the price
is set.
Mathematically Metered Supply
One of the keys to supporting bitcoin’s value was its issuance
model. Recall from Chapter 2 that miners—the people running
the computers building Bitcoin’s blockchain—are paid each
time they append a block of transactions. They are paid in new
bitcoin created by a coinbase transaction that is included in
each block.  For the first four years of Bitcoin’s life, a
coinbase transaction would issue 50 bitcoin to the lucky miner.
The difficulty of this proof-of-work process was recalibrated
automatically every two weeks with the goal of keeping the
amount of time between blocks at an average of 10 minutes.
In other words, 50 new bitcoin were released every 10
minutes, and the degree of difficulty was increased or
decreased by the Bitcoin software to keep that output time
frame intact.

10

In the first year of bitcoin running, 300 bitcoin were
released per hour (60 minutes, 10 minutes per block, 50
bitcoin released per block), 7,200 bitcoin per day, and 2.6
million bitcoin per year.
Based on our evolutionary past, a key driver for humans to
recognize something as valuable is its scarcity. Satoshi knew
that he couldn’t issue bitcoin at a rate of 2.6 million per year
forever, because it would end up with no scarcity value.
Therefore, he decided that every 210,000 blocks—which at
one block per 10 minutes takes four years—his program would
cut in half the amount of bitcoin issued in coinbase
transactions.  This event is known as a “block reward
halving” or “halving” for short.
On November 28, 2012, the first halving of the block
reward from 50 bitcoin to 25 bitcoin happened, and the second
halving from 25 bitcoin to 12.5 bitcoin occurred on July 9,
2016. The third will happen four years from that date, in July
2020.  Thus far, this has made bitcoin’s supply schedule look
somewhat linear, as shown in Figure 4.1.
11
12

Figure 4.1 
 Bitcoin’s supply schedule (short-term view) Data sourced from
Blockchain.info
However, when we step back and take a longer-term
perspective, bitcoin’s supply trajectory looks anything but
linear (see Figure 4.2). In fact, by the end of the 2020s it will
approach a horizontal asymptote, with annual supply inflation
less than 0.5 percent. In other words, Satoshi rewarded early
adopters with the most new bitcoin to get sufficient support,
and in so doing created a big enough base of monetary
liquidity for the network to use. He understood that if bitcoin
was a success over time its dollar value would increase, and
therefore he could decrease the rate of issuance while still
rewarding its supporters.

Figure 4.2  Bitcoin’s supply schedule (long-term view)
Long term, the thinking is that bitcoin will become so
entrenched within the global economy that new bitcoin will
not need to be issued to continue to gain support. At that point,
miners will be compensated for processing transactions and
securing the network through fees on high transaction
volumes.
It’s common to hear that bitcoin supply will max out at 21
million units by 2140. This is a function of continuing to
divide the units of supply released by a factor of two every
four years. As of January 1, 2017, already 76.6 percent of
bitcoin’s supply had been brought into existence,  and by the
time the next block reward halving happens in 2020, 87.5
percent of the bitcoin ever to be minted will be in existence. A
few years after 2100, we will reach a supply of 20,999,999
bitcoin, which is effectively 21 million. It is bitcoin’s scarce
13

supply schedule that makes many think of it as digital gold.
THE BIRTH OF ALTCOINS
Within a couple years of launching, it had become clear that
bitcoin was the first fully decentralized cryptocurrency to gain
significant adoption, but there were some aspects with which
people were not fully satisfied. For example, bitcoin’s 10-
minute block time meant that, depending on when a consumer
hit send, it could take up to 10 minutes, sometimes more, for
the transaction to be appended to Bitcoin’s blockchain.
Often this delay was more of an issue for the merchant than
the consumer, as the merchants needed to know they were
getting paid before they could release a good or service.
Others worried about bitcoin’s hash function in the proof-of-
work process, because hardware was being created that
specialized in this hash function and would lead to increased
centralization of the mining network. For a decentralized
currency, increased centralization of the machines that
processed its transactions was concerning. Fortunately,
Bitcoin’s protocol is open-source software, which meant
developers could download the entirety of its source code and
tweak the aspects they felt most needed fixing. When the
updated software was ready, the developers released it in a
manner similar to how Bitcoin was originally released. The
new software operated similarly to Bitcoin, but required its
own set of developers to maintain it, miners to provide the
hardware, and a separate blockchain to keep track of the debits
and credits of the new native asset.
Through this combination of open-source software and
14

ingenious programmers, many other cryptocurrencies have
been brought into existence. Those that are only slight
modifications of Bitcoin are often referred to as altcoins.
BITCOIN’S FIRST DIGITAL SIBLING
Namecoin  was the first significant fork away from
Bitcoin. Interestingly, it was less about creating a new
currency and more about utilizing the immutable nature of
the blockchain, a use case we’ll address more in the next
chapter. A website created with Namecoin comes with the
.bit domain (as opposed to the .com domain) and provides
security and censorship resistance to those sites registered
with it.
Namecoin grew out of an idea on the Bitcointalk forum
in 2010 that focused on BitDNS (DNS stands for domain
naming service, which handles all web addresses).  In
2013, a service called NameID was released that uses the
Namecoin blockchain to enable the creation of and access
to websites that have a Namecoin identity.
Namecoin acts as its own DNS service, and provides
users with more control and privacy. As opposed to the
typical way in which websites are registered through a
government controlled service such as ICANN, a
Namecoin site is registered through a service that exists on
each computer on the Namecoin network. This improves
security, privacy, and speed. To gain a .bit site, one must
have namecoin to do so, thus the need for the native asset.
Litecoin
15
16
17

While a handful of altcoins were released through 2011,
Litecoin was the first that would retain significant value to this
day. The cryptocurrency was developed by Charlie Lee, an
MIT graduate who was a software engineer at Google. When
Lee learned of Bitcoin he quickly understood its power,
leading him to mine bitcoin before trying to create his own
variants. After the unsuccessful launch of Fairbrix in
September 2011, Lee tried again with Litecoin in October.
Litecoin aimed to improve upon Bitcoin in two ways. For
one, Litecoin’s block times were 2.5 minutes, four times faster
than Bitcoin’s, which would be important for merchants
needing faster confirmation of consumer’s payments.
Second, Litecoin used a different hash function in the
proof-of-work process—also known as a block hashing
algorithm—which tried to make the mining process more
accessible to hobbyists. To put it into perspective, in the early
years of Bitcoin mining, people used central processing units
(CPUs), which are the core chips in personal computers,
effectively forcing the computers to be used solely for mining
purposes. In 2010, people after greater efficiency began using
the graphic card (GPU) of an existing computer for the mining
process.
Many, including Lee, anticipated a shift to yet more
dedicated and specialized mining devices called ASICs
(application-specific integrated circuits). ASICs required
custom manufacturing and specifically designed computers.
As a result, Lee correctly foresaw that bitcoin mining would
ramp beyond the reach of hobbyist miners and their
homegrown PCs.
Lee wanted a coin that retained its peer-to-peer roots and
18

allowed users to be miners without the need for specialized
and expensive mining units. Litecoin accomplished this by
using a block hashing algorithm called scrypt, which is
memory intensive and harder for specialized chips like ASICs
to gain a significant edge upon.
Other than these two tweaks, much of Litecoin remained
similar to Bitcoin.
The innovative investor will have realized, however, that if
blocks are issued four times as fast as bitcoin, then the total
amount of litecoin released will be four times greater than that
of bitcoin. This is exactly the case, as litecoin will converge
upon a fixed 84 million units, whereas bitcoin will converge
upon a quarter of that, at 21 million units.  Lee tweaked the
halving characteristics, too, so that a halving occurs at 840,000
blocks, as opposed to bitcoin’s 210,000. As Figure 4.3 shows,
this puts litecoin on a similar yet larger supply trajectory than
bitcoin. Notably, the annual rates of supply inflation are
exactly the same for the number of years the cryptocurrency is
from launch.
19

Figure 4.3  The comparative supply schedules of Litecoin and Bitcoin
It’s important to realize that if bitcoin and litecoin are both
being used in similar size markets and therefore have the same
size network values, a unit of litecoin will be one-fourth as
valuable as a unit of bitcoin because there are four times as
many units outstanding. This is an important lesson, because
all cryptocurrencies differ in their supply schedules, and thus
the direct price of each cryptoasset should not be compared if
trying to ascertain the appreciation potential of the asset.
Litecoin’s network is often used as a testing ground for
Bitcoin software updates, given that Litecoin is nimbler than
Bitcoin because it stores a fraction of the monetary value. It
has also been used as the basis for other cryptoassets. At the
start of 2017, litecoin was the fourth largest cryptoasset in
terms of network value.
Ripple
20

Ripple is a cryptocurrency created in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, a
web developer from Vancouver, British Columbia. Work on
the project actually began before Satoshi and Bitcoin,  when
Fugger was searching for a way to allow communities to
create a system of money out of chains of trust. For example,
if Alice trusts Bob, and Bob trusts Candace, and Candace
trusts Dave, then Alice can send money to Dave (whom she
doesn’t know) by first transferring value to Bob, who transfers
that same value to Candace, who takes that value and deposits
it in Dave’s account. Using this concept, payments can
“ripple” through the network via these chains of trust. Fugger
called this concept RipplePay.com.
While Fugger’s RipplePay did grow to 4,000 users,  it did
not catch fire the way bitcoin did. In August 2012, Fugger was
approached by the notable financial innovators Chris Larsen
and Jed McCaleb. Larsen had founded E-Loan—one of the
first companies to provide access to mortgage loans online—
and Prosper, a leader in the peer-to-peer lending space.
McCaleb was the founder of Mt. Gox, the biggest bitcoin and
cryptocurrency exchange in the world at that time.
Fugger announced the partnership: “I believe if anyone can
develop the Ripple concept on a global scale, they can. Their
system is based on a Bitcoin-style blockchain, much as we
have discussed here over the last few years as an interesting
possibility, but with a novel miner-less consensus mechanism
that allows transactions to be confirmed near instantaneously.”
Interestingly, in November 2012, this statement from
Fugger appeared on Bitcoin’s dedicated communication
channel, a Reddit-style site called bitcointalk, under the
heading, “Is Ripple a Bitcoin Killer or Complementer?
21
22
23

Founder of Mt. Gox will launch Ripple.”  This would not be
the last time someone asked if a new upstart would be a
Bitcoin-killer.
Not long after, in the spring of 2013, it was announced that
Larsen and McCaleb’s company that developed the Ripple
protocol, then called OpenCoin, had secured funding from
prestigious venture capitalists, including Andreessen
Horowitz.  This was a notable development—a sign of
approval of the viability of cryptocurrency from one of the
most revered venture capital firms in the world. OpenCoin
would later rebrand as Ripple Labs.
Ripple’s technology did several new things. It didn’t have
miners. Instead it utilized a consensus algorithm that relied on
trusted subnetworks to keep a broader decentralized network
of validators in sync. That’s enough to confuse any innovative
investor. What’s important to recognize is that Ripple’s
consensus algorithm relied on trust of some sort, which was
vastly different from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work design that
assumed anyone could be a bad actor.
Ripple also used trusted gateways as endpoints for users,
and these gateways could take deposits and redeem debts in all
kinds of asset pairs, including traditional fiat currency. This
built off Fugger’s original chains of trust but on a global multi-
asset scale. Routing a transaction through Ripple’s network
was like sending a packet of information through the Internet,
pinging amid connected servers.
If users didn’t want to rely on these gateways, Ripple also
had its own native cryptocurrency, called ripples, and
commonly referred to as XRP. XRP could be used to connect
two endpoints in the Ripple network that didn’t have a
24
25

connection of trust.
But this is where the Ripple team ran into contentious
territory, even if the concept was born of good intentions.
Since there was no mining process, there was no means to
distribute XRP. Instead, 100 billion units of XRP were created
and initially held by Ripple Labs (at that time, OpenCoin).
While there was, and still is, intent to distribute all this XRP to
seed use, as of writing the majority of XRP is still under the
control of Ripple Labs.
This has led to mistrust of the Ripple protocol from much
of the cryptocurrency community. Vitalik Buterin, who would
later go on to create Ethereum, wrote in February 2013 for
Bitcoin Magazine: “Because of the monetary distribution,
OpenCoin may well face an uphill battle convincing the
community that they can be trusted.”
Pricing services like CoinCap don’t list XRP’s total
available supply as the 100 billion that Ripple lists  but only
include the ripple that has thus far been distributed to the
public, which is just north of 37 billion units.  A word to the
wise for the innovative investor: with a new cryptocurrency,
it’s always important to understand how it’s being distributed
and to whom (we’ll discuss this further in Chapter 12). If the
core community feels the distribution is unfair, that may
forever plague the growth of the cryptocurrency.
Ripple has since pivoted away from being a transaction
mechanism for the common person and instead now “enables
banks to send real-time international payments across
networks.”  This focus plays to Ripple’s strengths, as it aims
to be a speedy payment system that rethinks correspondent
banking but still requires some trust, for which banks are well
26

suited.
Dogecoin
A somewhat comic cryptocurrency addition arrived on
December 8, 2013 (less than two weeks after bitcoin hit a
notable high of $1,242) in the form of dogecoin.  Dogecoin
was launched as a riff off Doge the dog, which Wired
magazine had pegged as 2013’s meme  of the year.  Doge
was a Shiba Inu dog whose image with captions of an internal
monologue went viral.
Dogecoin was initially floated as a joke. Jackson Palmer,
who worked in the marketing department of Adobe’s Sydney
offices and was a cryptocurrency enthusiast, sent the tweet:
“Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it’s the next big thing.”
After a positive reception to what was intended as a joke, he
bought the domain, Dogecoin.com. Jackson’s activity caught
the attention of Billy Markus, a Portland, Oregon-based
developer who aspired to launch a new cryptoasset. In
Markus’s own words: “The first thing I said was, ‘This is so
funny.’ Then I said, ‘I should just make this coin.’”
Markus used Litecoin’s code to derive Dogecoin, thereby
making it one more degree of separation removed from
Bitcoin. If Litecoin was a child of Bitcoin, then Dogecoin was
a grandchild of Bitcoin. A notable variation was that Dogecoin
planned to issue a much larger amount of dogecoin than
bitcoin or even litecoin. The plan was to have 100 billion
dogecoin in circulation after 1.5 years.  That would equal
nearly 5,000 times more coins than bitcoin when it reaches its
maximum supply.
Markus’s team later chose to issue roughly 5 billion coins
30
31
32
33
34
35

each year, and this created a vastly different supply schedule
from those of the deflationary bitcoin and litecoin. Dogecoin
mostly gained traction amongst Internet tippers. The supply
schedule has kept the value of a single dogecoin to a fraction
of a cent, which is suited to its intended use case. As Palmer
stated in an early interview:
It’s not taking itself as seriously, it’s not being used by people worrying
about whether they’ll become rich … It’s something to share for thanks or
kudos.
Palmer’s marketing expertise was another feature that
differentiated Dogecoin from other cryptocurrencies at the
time. The Dogecoin community raised $50,000 via Dogecoin
to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics; raised
another $55,000 via Dogecoin to sponsor a NASCAR driver
who raced with the Dogecoin logo at the Talladega Speedway;
and raised money to support clean water projects in Kenya via
Doge4Water, making the donation via a Twitter-based tip
service.
While Dogecoin may have been launched as a joke, its
association with a wildly popular Internet meme, its
lighthearted origins, and its savvy focus on slick marketing led
to a quick rise, and its network value grew to $70 million only
seven weeks after launch.  But that did not last long. As of
March 2017, its network value had dipped to slightly above
$20 million.
This bizarre merger of a cryptoasset and pop culture is not
surprising considering 2013 was the year that the price of
bitcoin ranged from $13 in January to over $1,000 in early
December.  The power and enthusiasm of Dogecoin’s user
community shouldn’t be dismissed, even if we encourage the
36
37
38
39

innovative investor to do ample due diligence on it as an
investment. While Dogecoin had its flaws, it continues to exist
and has taught the cryptocurrency space valuable lessons
about gathering community support in an Internet era.
AURORACOIN: ICELAND’S NATIONAL CRYPTOCURRENCY?
Much like the anonymous Satoshi, Auroracoin’s creator
also had a fictitious name: Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson.
Baldur created Auroracoin based on Litecoin’s code and
decided to “airdrop” the cryptocurrency to Icelanders with
the intent of providing 50 percent of all auroracoin in
existence to residents. The hope was that such a
distribution would jump-start national use of the
cryptocurrency.
A key to Baldur’s plan was his access to the
government’s national identification system, which led
speculators to believe mistakenly that Auroracoin was
sponsored by the Icelandic government. In anticipation of
the airdrop, speculators bid Auroracoin’s network value
over $1 billion.
By the time the airdrop began on March 25, 2014,
speculators had sobered somewhat, and Auroracoin was
hovering just over a $100 million network value. By the
end of the month, it would be below $20 million, as
citizens receiving Auroracoin moved to sell it on
exchanges to turn a profit.  Along with the drop in price
was a loss of confidence and enthusiasm for the new
cryptocurrency. Few, if any, retailers were willing to
accept auroracoin, and it was soon considered a “failed
experiment.”  Some also saw it as a scam perpetrated by
40
41
42

its creator. To this day, auroracoin takes the cake as the
cryptocurrency with the grandest plan for widespread
usage throughout one country.
It continues to exist, with a handful of Icelandic
developers working to revive the concept and the
technology. In 2016, ads began to appear throughout
Iceland’s capital city of Reykjavik heralding the return of
Auroracoin. As a result, beers in Iceland were being
purchased for auroracoin,  and many other retail
establishments began to utilize the cryptocurrency. Then a
scandal hit and the prime minister was forced to resign
because of his involvement with the Panama Papers.
This led to the growth in popularity of a political party
known as the Pirate Party, which had a favorable view on
cryptocurrencies.  Suddenly there was speculation  that
Iceland could revisit the potential for Auroracoin and its
role as a national cryptocurrency.  As acceptance grows
and politics change, it will be interesting to watch what
happens next for the Icelandic cryptocurrency.
Auroracoin is a cautionary tale for both investors and
developers. What began as a seemingly powerful and
compelling use case for a cryptoasset suffered from its
inability to provide value to the audience it sought to
impact. Icelanders were given a cryptocurrency with little
education and means to use it. Unsurprisingly, the value of
the asset collapsed and most considered it dead.
Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies rarely die entirely, and
Auroracoin may have interesting times ahead if its
developer team can figure out a way forward.

THE RACE FOR PRIVACY: DASH,
MONERO, AND ZCASH
While Litecoin, Ripple, and Dogecoin all added elements to
the mix of what it meant to be a cryptocurrency, they did not
provide the privacy that many early Bitcoin advocates yearned
for. It is a common misconception, even for Bitcoin, that it is
an anonymous payment network. Bitcoin transactions are
pseudonymous, and since every transaction can be seen by any
third party, there is a wealth of information for anyone who
would like to pinpoint who the participants are. Inarguably,
someone who wants to use a currency for illegal activity is
better off using cash than bitcoin. With every transaction,
bitcoin leaves an indelible digital mark in Bitcoin’s
blockchain.
Currently, three notable cryptocurrencies put privacy and
anonymity first. In order of launch, they are Dash, Monero,
and Zcash. All three pursue this value proposition differently.
Monero is likely the most relevant to the innovative investor,
with a sustained record of operations, solid cryptography, and
a sound issuance model. While Dash has merits, it has
contested origins. Meanwhile, Zcash uses some of the most
bleeding-edge cryptography in the world, but it is one of the
youngest cryptoassets in the book and suitable only for the
most experienced cryptoasset investors.
Monero and Its Predecessor, Bytecoin
Monero is a descendent of a lesser-known cryptocurrency
called Bytecoin. Bytecoin was crafted quite differently from
Bitcoin, using technology known as CryptoNote. Similar to

Litecoin’s scrypt, CryptoNote’s block hashing algorithm aims
to avoid the specialization and therefore centralization of the
miners supporting the network by requiring an order of
operations that favors general purpose chips like the CPUs
found in PCs.  Beyond a focus on more egalitarian proof-of-
work, CryptoNote provided untraceable payments, unlinkable
transactions, and blockchain analysis resistance.  Adam Back
is considered the inspiration for Satoshi’s proof-of-work
algorithm and is president of Blockstream, one of the most
important companies in the Bitcoin space. In March 2014, he
tweeted about CryptoNote, saying it was one of the few ideas
in the cryptocurrency space outside of Bitcoin that held a
“defensible rationale for existence.”
Some may ask why Monero stole the show from Bytecoin.
Bytecoin’s blockchain and the issuance of its currency,
bytecoin, started on July 4, 2012, but it did not become widely
known until almost two years later when an announcement for
it appeared on bitcointalk.org on March 12, 2014.  People
were intrigued but confused about why the Bytecoin team had
taken two years to make it public. Some argued that it was
because the developers wanted to make sure the technology
was soundly running before drawing more attention. Others
argued that something more insidious was at play, called a
premine (pronounced “premine”).
Bytecoin planned to issue 184.46 billion bytecoin via the
mining process, but by the time it was made publicly known,
150 billion bytecoin were already in existence, more than 80
percent of the total supply.  A classic premine, Bytecoin had
quietly released a large amount of the coins in a manner that
disadvantaged the broader community. Bitcoin and the
48
49
50
51
52

permissionless blockchain movement was founded on
principles of egalitarian transparency, so premines are widely
frowned upon. While they still occur, many are scams that the
innovative investor should be wary of. A key differentiator
between a scam and good intent is the communication and
rationale of the developer team behind the issuance model.
On April 8, 2014, the bitcointalk.org user named “eizh,”
who would later become a Monero developer, made the
comment, “I’m surprised someone hasn’t started a clone for a
fairer distribution and active development.”  On April 9,
2014, only a month after the public announcement of
Bytecoin, an involved user known as “thankful_for_today,”
made a post to bitcointalk.org titled “Bitmonero—a new coin
based on CryptoNote technology—launched,” with the intent
to launch mining in nine days.  BitMonero was quickly
renamed Monero and often referred to as XMR.
The most defining feature of Monero is its use of ring
signatures, a cryptographic technology that had been evolving
since 1991.  Monero’s ring signatures are best explained in
the context of Bitcoin. In Bitcoin, to create a transaction, a
known individual signs off on the balance of bitcoin he or she
is trying to send. In Monero, a group of individuals signs off
on a transaction creating a ring signature, but only one in the
group owns that monero. The CryptoNote website puts it
succinctly:
In the case of ring signatures, we have a group of individuals, each with
their own secret and public key. The statement proved by ring signatures is
that the signer of a given message is a member of the group. The main
distinction with the ordinary digital signature schemes is that the signer
needs a single secret key, but a verifier cannot establish the exact identity of
the signer. Therefore, if you encounter a ring signature with the public keys
of Alice, Bob and Carol, you can only claim that one of these individuals
53
54
55

was the signer but you will not be able to pinpoint him or her.
While many are suspicious of such privacy, it should be
noted that it has tremendous benefits for fungibility.
Fungibility refers to the fact that any unit of currency is as
valuable as another unit of equal denomination. A danger for
bitcoin, especially for balances known to have been used for
illegal activity, is that if an exchange or other service blacklists
that balance, then that balance becomes illiquid and arguably
less valuable than other balances of bitcoin. While subtle,
losing fungibility could be the demise of a digital and
distributed currency, hurting the value of all units, not just the
ones used for illegal activity. Fortunately, this is one problem
that Monero does not have to deal with.
Monero’s supply schedule is a hybrid of Litecoin and
Dogecoin. For monero, a new block is appended to its
blockchain every 2 minutes, similar to Litecoin’s 2.5 minutes.
Like Dogecoin, however, it will have a small degree of
inflation for its entire life beginning in May 2022, when 0.3
monero will be released every minute, totaling 157,680
monero every year. At that time, there will be 18.1 million
units of monero outstanding, so inflation in that first year will
be only 0.87 percent.  As we head further into the future, that
inflation decreases as the base of monero outstanding
increases. Interestingly, in 2040 there will be nearly equivalent
units of bitcoin and monero outstanding, and in the period of
2019 to 2027, Monero’s rate of supply inflation will be lower
than Bitcoin’s, but in all other periods the opposite is true.
Expectedly, Monero’s ability to create privacy in
transactions was a technological breakthrough that was
recognized within the cryptoasset community and the markets.
56
57
58

By the end of 2016, Monero had the fifth largest network
value of any cryptocurrency and was the top performing
digital currency in 2016, with a price increase over the year of
2,760 percent. This clearly demonstrates the level of interest in
privacy protecting cryptocurrency. Some of that interest, no
doubt, comes from less than savory sources.
Dash
Another cryptocurrency targeting privacy and fungibility is
Dash. It launched its blockchain a few months before Monero,
on January 19, 2014. Its lead developer, Evan Duffield,
created Dash by forking the Bitcoin protocol and
implementing a coin focused on privacy and speedy settlement
of transactions. The Dash white paper that Duffield coauthored
outlined his intent:
A cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin, the work of Satoshi Nakamoto, with
various improvements such as a two-tier incentivized network, known as the
Masternode network. Included are other improvements such as Darksend,
for increasing fungibility and InstantX which allows instant transaction
confirmation without a centralized authority.
Dash, however, got off to a rocky start. Instead of a premine, it
had what is called an instamine, where 1.9 million coins were
created in the first 24 hours. Considering that three years later,
in January 2017, there were just north of 7 million coins, this
was a significant error that drastically benefited the computers
that supported the Dash network in the first 24 hours, notably
Duffield himself.
Duffield reasonably pleaded best intentions, arguing that, “I
was working a very challenging day job while working on
Dash in the first couple weeks. So I was putting out fires every
59

night, keeping tabs on Dash during the day (while getting
yelled at by my boss when he caught me a couple times).”
From our perspective, if there is a major disruption or error
in the launch of a cryptocurrency that significantly skews its
distribution, then that cryptocurrency should be relaunched. In
fact, Duffield easily could have relaunched Dash, especially
considering the network was only days old when the instamine
began to be widely talked about, but he chose not to. It
wouldn’t have been unusual to relaunch, given that other
cryptocurrencies have done so via the forking of original code.
The creators of Monero, for example, specifically chose not to
continue building off Bytecoin because the premine
distribution had been perceived as unfair.
Zcash
The most interest in a cryptocurrency in 2016 was generated
by a new cryptoasset called Zcash. The Bitcoin and blockchain
community has always been excited by new developments in
anonymity and privacy, but Zcash took that excitement to a
new level, which upon issuance drove the price through the
roof. Like bitcoin’s, zcash’s issuance model was ethical.
However, when bitcoin launched from zero units outstanding,
next to no one knew about it. When zcash launched from zero
units outstanding, it seemed like the entire crypto-universe
knew about it, and everyone wanted some.
The scarcity in initial supply combined with the hype
pushed the price of zcash to astronomical levels. It quickly
reached $1,000 per coin, which at the time was even higher
than the price of bitcoin. At one point on Poloniex, a popular
cryptoasset exchange, the price reached 1 zcash for 3,299
60

bitcoin, or almost $2 million at the time.  However, by the
end of 2016, the hysteria had dissipated and zcash was trading
in a stable range of $45 to $50.
The Zcash team is led by Zooko Wilcox, whom we have
mentioned prior as an early employee at David Chaum’s
DigiCash. Through his time at DigiCash and longstanding
involvement in cryptography and cryptoassets, Zooko has
become one of the most respected members in the community.
A key innovation of Zcash is the use of a type of zero-
knowledge proof, referred to as zk-SNARKs, which allow
transactions to be sent between parties without any
information being revealed other than the validity of the
transaction. While it is still early days for Zcash, we are of the
belief that the ethics and technology chops of Zooko and his
team are top-tier, implying that good things lie in wait for this
budding cryptocurrency.
• • •
By the end of 2016, the price of bitcoin had reached a level
just below $1,000 (which it broke in January 2017), and there
were over 800 cryptoassets in a market that totaled over $17
billion. At that time, the top assets in order of network value
were: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum
Classic, and Dash.
The innovative investor may note from this list that
Ethereum follows Bitcoin. Its story is one that includes
brilliant developers, a wider definition of blockchain
technology, and one of the largest hacks on a cryptoasset
ecosystem to date. In the next chapter, we’ll look at the
creation of Ethereum and the significant impact it has and will
have on the future of cryptoassets.

Chapter 5
Cryptocommodities and
Cryptotokens
ryptocurrencies are a powerful vertical of cryptoassets, but as
we laid out in the start of the last chapter, only one of three.
The other two, cryptocommodities and cryptotokens, are a
rapidly growing segment of this budding new asset class. First,
let’s look at cryptocommodities.
In some ways, cryptocommodities are more tangible in
value than cryptocurrencies. For example, the largest
cryptocommodity, Ethereum, is a decentralized world
computer upon which globally accessible and uncensored
applications can be built. It’s easy to appreciate the value of
using such a computer, and therefore Ethereum provides a
digitally tangible resource. Paying to use Ethereum’s world
computer—also known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM)—is reminiscent of when schools and libraries had
shared computers that students could use. One person could sit
down and use a computer for a while before moving on, and
then another person would come and use it.
The Ethereum Virtual Machine operates somewhat

similarly to a shared computer, except it is global in scale and
more than one user can operate it at a time. Just as everyone
can see Bitcoin transactions from anywhere in the world,
anyone can see Ethereum’s programs running from anywhere
in the world. While this chapter will dive deep into Ethereum
as a cryptocommodity, there are many other budding
cryptocommodities, provisioning decentralized resources like
cloud storage, bandwidth, transcoding, proxy re-encryption,
and so on.
THE IDEA BEHIND ETHEREUM’S
WORLD COMPUTER
The founding team of Ethereum and its native asset, ether,
weren’t the first to dream of globally distributed computer
programs, or what are commonly referred to as smart
contracts. For example, Nick Szabo, who was also one of
Chaum’s disciples at DigiCash (Chapter 4), had been talking
about smart contracts and digital property since the early
1990s. In 1996, he published an article in the magazine
Extropy on the topic entitled “Smart Contracts.”
Smart contracts are critical to understand but have a
misleading name. The first thing people think of when they
hear smart contracts is legal documents that think for
themselves, which misses the mark by a wide margin. We
believe smart contracts are better thought of as conditional
transactions because they refer to logic written in code that
has “IF this, THEN that” conditions. For example, it can easily
be programmed in a smart contract that “IF Jack misses his
flight and IF it was the airline’s fault, THEN the airline pays
1

him the cost of the flight.” A vending machine is another
commonly used example of a smart contract: “IF the user puts
in enough money and IF the user types in the right code,
THEN the user gets Doritos.” These conditions can become
much more complex, creating conditional waterfalls
depending on the process being programmed and the variables
that need to be met.
While Szabo had the early vision for smart contracts, the
Ethereum team would be the first to create a mainstream and
attention-grabbing platform to execute smart contracts in a
decentralized manner. At the core of the team is Vitalik
Buterin, who many regard as Ethereum’s Satoshi.
Buterin was born in Russia but grew up in Canada. He had
the good fortune of a freethinking father,  who in February
2011 introduced 17-year-old Buterin to Satoshi’s work and
Bitcoin.  Bitcoin had only been functioning for two years at
that point, and no major alternative was in existence. It would
not be until October of that year that Charlie Lee would
release Litecoin.
It wasn’t long before Buterin fell down the Bitcoin rabbit
hole. He quickly became one of the first well-known
journalists pioneering the world of cryptoassets, even
cofounding Bitcoin Magazine, which remains one of the best
deep dive sites for technical analysis of blockchain
architectures. While writing articles that merged sophisticated
technical information with an enthusiastic and optimistic style,
he used his mathematical prowess to consider how to improve
on the technology. He was, after all, a Bronze medal winner at
the International Olympiad in Informatics  at the age of 18 and
could reportedly add three-digit numbers in his head at twice
2
3
4

the speed of the average human being.
To that end, Buterin tinkered with a number of Bitcoin
projects that would inform his future work on Ethereum. In a
blog post titled “Ethereum: Now Going Public,” he started
with a tip of the hat to Bitcoin:
I first wrote the initial draft of the Ethereum whitepaper on a cold day in
San Francisco in November, as a culmination of months of thought and
often frustrating work into an area that we have come to call
“cryptocurrency 2.0”—in short, using the Bitcoin blockchain for more than
just money. In the months leading up to the development of Ethereum, I had
the privilege to work closely with several projects attempting to implement
colored coins, smart property, and various types of decentralized exchange.
The projects Buterin references in the last sentence
approached the transaction of bitcoin using Bitcoin’s
blockchain more abstractly. As we have already learned,
transacting bitcoin involves the transmission of information
that results in a debit or credit of a balance of bitcoin in a
user’s address.
In his blog post, Buterin mentions colored coins. These
involve the marking of an address in Bitcoin with information
beyond just the balance of bitcoin in that address. Further
identifiers could also be appended to the address, such as
information that represented ownership of a house. In
transferring that bitcoin in that address to another address, so
too went the marker of information about house ownership.
In this sense, by sending bitcoin, the transaction also
signified the transaction of property rights to a house. There
are several regulatory authorities that need to recognize that
transfer for this example to become an everyday reality, but
the point is to show how all kinds of value can be transmitted
through Bitcoin’s blockchain.

COUNTERPARTY: SMART CONTRACTS ON BITCOIN
Counterparty is a cryptocommodity that runs atop Bitcoin,
and was launched in January 2014 with a similar intent as
Ethereum. It has a fixed supply of 2.6 million units of its
native asset, XCP, which were all created upon launch. As
described on Counterparty’s website, “Counterparty
enables anyone to write specific digital agreements, or
programs known as Smart Contracts, and execute them on
the Bitcoin blockchain.”  Since Bitcoin allows for small
amounts of data to be transmitted in transactions and
stored on Bitcoin’s blockchain, it becomes the system of
record for Counterparty’s more flexible functionality.
Since Counterparty relies upon Bitcoin, it does not have its
own mining ecosystem.
The reason Bitcoin developers haven’t added extra
functionality and flexibility directly into its software is that
they have prioritized security over complexity. The more
complex transactions become, the more vectors there are to
exploit and attack these transactions, which can affect the
network as a whole. With a focus on being a decentralized
global currency, Bitcoin developers have decided bitcoin
transactions don’t need all the bells and whistles. Instead,
other developers can either find ways to build atop
Bitcoin’s limited functionality, turning to Bitcoin’s
blockchain as a system of record and means of security
(e.g., Counterparty), or build an entirely different
blockchain system (e.g., Ethereum).
Many were working on building this decentralized future
on top of Bitcoin, but it wasn’t easy. The flexibility in adding
7

identifiers to addresses and creating different kinds of
transactions was purposefully restricted in Bitcoin for the sake
of scalability and security. Bitcoin, after all, was still an
experiment. A decentralized currency was enough of a holy
grail for Satoshi, and he didn’t have to swallow the whole
world in one bite. But Buterin wasn’t satisfied with Bitcoin as
it was and had wide-ranging aspirations for improvements. He
wanted a system that was more flexible and that behaved more
like a computer and less like a calculator for debits and credits
of bitcoin balances.
Although he invented Ethereum in 2013, Buterin formally
announced it in January 2014 at the North American Bitcoin
Conference,  where he was surrounded by eager reporters,
many of whom had been his colleagues in months past. By
that time, he had already garnered the support of over 15
developers and dozens in the community outreach team.
In Ethereum’s white paper that initially described its inner
workings, Buterin’s team made no qualms about their
aspirations:
What is more interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the Ethereum
protocol moves far beyond just currency. Protocols around decentralized file
storage, decentralized computation and decentralized prediction markets,
among dozens of other such concepts, have the potential to substantially
increase the efficiency of the computational industry, and provide a massive
boost to other peer-to-peer protocols by adding for the first time an
economic layer.
Importantly, Buterin did not intend for Ethereum and its native
asset, ether, to be a minor variation on Bitcoin’s codebase.
This distinguished Ethereum from many of the altcoins that
came before it.
By having no affiliation with “coin” in its name, Ethereum
8
9
10

was moving beyond the idea of currency into the realm of
cryptocommodities. While Bitcoin is mostly used to send
monetary value between people, Ethereum could be used to
send information between programs. It would do so by
building a decentralized world computer with a Turing
complete programming language.  Developers could write
programs, or applications, that would run on top of this
decentralized world computer. Just as Apple builds the
hardware and operating system that allows developers to build
applications on top, Ethereum was promising to do the same in
a distributed and global system. Ether, the native unit, would
come into play as follows:
Ether is a necessary element—a fuel—for operating the distributed
application platform Ethereum. It is a form of payment made by the clients
of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations. To put it
another way, ether is the incentive ensuring that developers write quality
applications (wasteful code costs more), and that the network remains
healthy (people are compensated for their contributed resources).
Miners of Ethereum would be processing transactions that
could transfer not just ether but also information among
programs. Just as Bitcoin miners were compensated for
supporting the network by earning bitcoin, so too would
Ethereum miners by earning ether, and the process would be
supported by a similar proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
GETTING ETHEREUM OFF THE
GROUND
Buterin understood that building a system from the ground up
required a significant amount of work, and his announcement
in January 2014 involved the collaboration of a community of
11
12

more than 15 developers and dozens of community members
that had already bought into the idea. Satoshi’s announcement
of Bitcoin, in contrast, had involved a quiet mailing of the
white paper to a relatively unknown mailing list composed
mainly of academics and hardcore cryptographers. The
ensuing development of the Bitcoin software before launch
mostly involved just two people, Satoshi and Hal Finney.
Buterin also knew that while Ethereum could run on ether,
the people who designed it couldn’t, and Ethereum was still
over a year away from being ready for release. So he found
funding through the prestigious Thiel Fellowship. Billionaire
Peter Thiel, who cofounded PayPal and was Facebook’s first
outside investor, created the Thiel Fellowship to reward
talented individuals who leave the traditional path of college
and pursue immediate ways to make an impact in the world.
Winners might conduct scientific research, create a startup, or
find other ways to improve society and the world. Thiel
Fellowship’s carefully chosen visionaries receive $100,000
over the course of two years, and the award has been
considered more competitive than gaining acceptance to the
world’s best universities. In June 2014, Buterin received the
Thiel Fellowship as a 20-year-old dropping out of the
University of Waterloo to pursue his interest in Ethereum on a
full-time basis.
While Buterin may go down as one of Thiel’s greatest
investments, Thiel wasn’t alone in recognizing the potential of
Ethereum. In 2014, Buterin was given the World Technology
Award in Information Technology Software,  alongside
influential names such as Elon Musk in the Energy category
and Walter Isaacson in Media & Journalism.
13
14
15

While the Thiel Fellowship was an indication of what was
to come for Buterin, $100,000 wasn’t enough to sustain his
team. To that end, from July 23, 2014, to September 2, 2014,
they staged a 42-day presale of ether, the cryptocommodity
underlying the Ethereum network.
Ether was sold at a range of 1,337 to 2,000 ether per
bitcoin, with 2,000 ether per bitcoin on offer for the first two
weeks of the presale and then declining linearly toward 1,337
ether per bitcoin in the latter half of the sale, creating
momentum by incentivizing people to buy in at the beginning.
Overseeing the legal and financial nuances around this sale
was the newly created Ethereum Foundation headquartered in
Zug, Switzerland.
Ethereum’s fund-raising effort was not only innovative and
timely, it was also record-breaking. The public invested
31,591 bitcoin, worth $18,439,086, for a total of 60,102,216
ether—an implied rate of $0.31 per ether. At the time, it was
the largest single crowdfunding effort.  Some thought it
outrageous that the team supporting a blockchain architecture
could raise $18 million without a functioning product, as this
was clearly different from Bitcoin’s process.
Venture capital investors (VCs) often invest in ideas and
development teams, having faith they will work their way
toward success. Ethereum democratized that process beyond
VCs. For perspective on the price of ether in this crowdsale,
consider that at the start of April 2017, ether was worth $50
per unit, implying returns over 160x in under three years.
Just over 9,000 people bought ether during the presale, placing
the average initial investment at $2,000, which has since
grown to over $320,000.

According to the Ethereum white paper, the profits from
this sale would be “used entirely to pay salaries and bounties
to developers, and invested into various for-profit and non-
profit projects in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency
ecosystem.” In addition to the 60 million ether sold to the
public, roughly 6 million was created to compensate early
contributors to Ethereum, and another 6 million for long-term
reserves of the Ethereum Foundation.
The extra allocation of 12 million ether for the early
contributors and Ethereum Foundation has proved problematic
for Ethereum over time, as some feel it represented double
dipping. In our view, with 15 talented developers involved
prior to the public sale, 6 million ether translated to just north
of $100,000 per developer at the presale rate, which is
reasonable given the market rate of such software developers.
That said, the allocation of capital into founders’ pockets is
an important aspect of crowdsales. Called a “founder’s
reward,” the key distinction between understandable and a red
flag is that the founders should be focused on building and
growing the network, not fattening their pockets at the expense
of investors. In our opinion, the Ethereum developers were not
fattening their pockets, they were putting food on the table.
Their modest allocation is a far cry from the antics that some
cryptoasset creators have attempted since.
Following the presale, it was a year of development before
the Ethereum network went live. During this time, the
Ethereum team stayed in close touch with its burgeoning
community, releasing proof-of-concepts for the community to
evaluate, organizing conferences, funding projects based on
Ethereum, and writing frequent blog updates.  Perhaps taking
21

note from Dogecoin, the Ethereum team understood the
importance of the community in bootstrapping support for its
decentralized system. Although blockchain architectures are
cold code, they are warm social networks.
With the money they raised, the Ethereum team was also
able to test the network before launch in a way that Satoshi
and his small group of supporters were not able to. Starting at
the end of 2014 and for the first half of 2015, the Ethereum
Foundation encouraged battle testing of its network, both in a
grassroots bug bounty program and in formal security audits
that involved professional third-party software security
firms.  The innovative investor should take note of this battle-
testing practice, which we also saw with Zcash, as it is an
indicator of how seriously core developers take security in
their decentralized architectures.
ETHEREUM AS A PLATFORM FOR
DAPPS
Ethereum’s network with its underlying blockchain went live
on July 30, 2015. While much development energy had gone
into creating the Ethereum software, this was the first time that
miners could get involved because there was finally a
blockchain for them to support. Prior to this launch, Ethereum
was quite literally suspended in the ether. Now, Ethereum’s
decentralization platform was open for business, serving as the
hardware and software base for decentralized applications
(dApps). These dApps can be thought of as complex smart
contracts, and could be created by developers independent of
the core Ethereum team, providing leverage to the reach of the
22

technology.
To explain how a dApp works, we’ll use an example from
the company Etherisc, which created a dApp for flight
insurance to a well-known Ethereum conference. This flight
insurance was purchased by 31 of the attendees.  Figure 5.1
shows a simplified diagram. Using Ethereum, developers can
mimic insurance pools with strings of conditional transactions.
Open sourcing this process and running it on top of
Ethereum’s world computer allows everyday investors to put
their capital in an insurance pool to earn returns from the
purchasers of insurance premiums that are looking for
coverage from certain events. Everyone trusts the system
because it runs in the open and is automated by code.
23

 Hypothetical dApp-based flight insurance
WELCOME TO THE AGE OF DAPPS AND
CRYPTOTOKENS
Since the launch of Ethereum, a near endless stream of dApps
have been released to run on it, many of which have their own
native unit. We refer to many of these dApp native units as
cryptotokens, while others refer to them as appcoins. A dApp
with its own native cryptotoken will use ether as a
cryptocommodity to pay the Ethereum network to process
certain dApp transactions. While many dApps use a
cryptotoken, the native units of some dApps should be
classified as a cryptocommodity layered on top of Ethereum,
like Golem, which aims to be a supercomputer for compute
intensive problems. The difference boils down to whether a
raw digital resource is being provisioned (cryptocommodity)
or if the dApp is providing a consumer-facing finished digital
good or service (cryptotoken).
Most cryptotokens are not supported by their own
blockchain. Often these cryptotokens operate within
applications that are built on a cryptocommodity’s blockchain,
such as Ethereum. To continue with the Apple analogy:
applications in Apple’s App Store don’t have to build their
own operating systems, they run on Apple’s operating system.
Due to Ethereum’s wild success, other decentralized world
computers have popped up, such as Dfinity, Lisk, Rootstock,
Tezos, Waves, and more that can support their own dApps.
Just as many altcoins tried to improve upon Bitcoin, these
platforms are cryptocommodities that aim to improve upon

Ethereum’s design, thereby attracting their own dApps and
associated cryptotokens.
A full list of Ethereum dApps can be seen and explored
here: http://dapps .ethercasts.com/. The code of many can be
investigated in full here: https://live.ether.camp/contracts. We
will look at the most (in)famous of the dApps thus far, as it
will inform the innovative investor on all future dApps and
potential cryptotoken investments. We should note that dApp
development and the associated native units has been one of
the fastest moving areas in the cryptoasset space, as we
watched new ones come out each week during the writing of
this book. Thus, the curious reader should take time after this
chapter to further explore them as we are only scratching the
tip of the iceberg in this section.
THE RISE AND (HARD) FALL OF THE
DAO
Standing for decentralized autonomous organization, The
DAO was a complex dApp that programmed a decentralized
venture capital fund to run on Ethereum. Holders of The DAO
would be able to vote on what projects they wanted to support,
and if developers raised enough funding from The DAO
holders, they would receive the funds necessary to build their
projects. Over time, investors in these projects would be
rewarded through dividends or appreciation of the service
provided.
The vision of a decentralized autonomous organization like
The DAO is somewhat like autonomous vehicles—whereas
humans used to have to drive cars, the cars increasingly can

drive themselves. Similarly, whereas humans used to be
needed for all aspects of business processes, often in manual
paper pushing, approval, orchestration, and so on, a
decentralized autonomous organization can codify much of
those processes so that the company better drives itself. As
exciting as the concept was, The DAO was nearly Ethereum’s
undoing.
The creators of The DAO implemented a crowdfunding
effort. Theirs surpassed the amount raised by Ethereum by
nearly an order of magnitude, setting the record for the largest
amount ever raised in this manner: over $168 million.  The
crowdfunding required that investments be made with ether,
and because of this, by the end of the crowdfunding period
The DAO team held 11.5 million ether, or 15 percent of all the
ether created to that point.
While enthusiasm and interest in The DAO was clear, some
developers were concerned it was not ready for prime time. A
paper published by a group of computer scientists who
examined the workings of The DAO expressed concern that
there were major security vulnerabilities that threatened its
pending release on Ethereum’s network. “The current
implementation can enable attacks with severe consequences,”
explained Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir, and Emin Gün Sirer.
Subsequently, there was a call for a moratorium on activity
around The DAO until the issues were satisfactorily
addressed.  However, the call went unheeded and on May 28,
2016, the day after the crowdsale was completed, tokens in
The DAO (DAOs)—which were received in exchange for the
ether invested at the crowdfunding—began trading on
exchanges.
24
25
26

Less than three weeks later, on June 17, 2016, a major hack
on The DAO was conducted that gained control of 3.6 million
ether, one-third of the amount that had been committed to the
project. The hack had nothing to do with an exchange, as had
been the case with Mt. Gox and other widely publicized
Bitcoin-related hacks. Instead, the flaw existed in the software
of The DAO. This software was hosted on Ethereum’s
blockchain, for all eyes to see, and it needed to be flawless.
However, as critics had pointed out, the code was far from
perfect. Given the scale of assets The DAO had raised, there
was significant incentive for a hacker to break in. As a result,
the world’s largest crowdfunding effort and a major showcase
for the capabilities of Ethereum became a bust.
Buterin and those involved with The DAO and Ethereum
immediately began to address the hack. The situation was
problematic, however, because Ethereum was a decentralized
world computer that provided the platform for dApps to run
on. However, it did not promise to audit and endorse each
application. Similarly, while Apple may screen the apps that
go into its App Store, it doesn’t claim responsibility for their
inner workings. Core Ethereum developers were helping The
DAO team. This was analogous to Apple engineers helping to
fix a flailing app.
None of the options to correct the situation were
particularly palatable. The primary solution was to release a
software update to Ethereum that would remove the funds
from the hacker’s account within The DAO, returning them to
the rightful shareholders. Known as a “hard fork,” Ethereum’s
blockchain would be slightly modified to allow for the
investors in the project to have their funds returned. Stephen
27

Tual, founder and COO of Slock.it, the main company behind
The DAO, explained the fix as follows, “In summary, a hard
fork will retrieve all stolen funds from the attacker. If you
have purchased DAO tokens, you will be transferred to a smart
contract where you can only retrieve funds. Since no money in
The DAO was ever spent, nothing was lost.”
However, a hard fork would run counter to what many in
the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities felt was the power of a
decentralized ledger. Forcefully removing funds from an
account violated the concept of immutability. This was
exacerbated by the fact that a centralized set of players was
making the decision. Many complained of moral hazard, and
that this would set a precedent for the U.S. government or
other powerful entities to come in someday and demand the
same of Ethereum for their own interests. It was a tough
decision for all involved, including Buterin, who while not
directly on The DAO developer team, was an administrator.
With an understanding of both sides of the debate, Buterin
supported the decision to hard fork because of his view that
Ethereum was still in a development stage and that a lesson
such as this would help shape the technology going forward. “I
don’t think the way things are done right now are precedent-
setting,” he said.  In the end, Buterin and much of the
Ethereum team used their own technical skills to aggressively
correct the situation that The DAO had created.
A hard fork doesn’t come without risks, and unfortunately,
Ethereum would pay a dear price for its decision to help The
DAO. While hard forks are often used to upgrade a blockchain
architecture, they are typically employed in situations where
the community agrees entirely on the beneficial updates to the
28
29
30

architecture. Ethereum’s situation was different, as many in
the community opposed a hard fork. Contentious hard forks
are dangerous, because when new software updates are
released for a blockchain in the form of a hard fork, there are
then two different operating systems. While the two operating
systems share a common ancestor, and therein a common
record of transactions, once the hard fork occurs, the two
operating systems split, and so too do their blockchains, each
with separate native units. While some people think, “Great,
I’ve just doubled my money,” a hard fork can often crash the
value of the native units on the two separate blockchains, as
people worry about an ongoing schism within a divided
community (see Figure 5.2). With two separate blockchains,
miners, developers, and companies building applications, users
must decide which blockchain and its inherent operating
system to support. While many initially claimed the hard fork
a success for Ethereum, a few big traders started to buy up as
much of the native asset on the lesser supported chain as
possible.

Figure 5.2  The forking of Ethereum as a result of The DAO’s bug
On July 23, 2016, cryptoasset exchange Poloniex listed this
newly branded network, called Ethereum Classic, with its own
native ether classic (ETC).  Once a widely used exchange
like Poloniex listed ETC, an open market was created for the
asset, and people quickly started to speculate on its value. This
drew more miners to support Ethereum Classic’s blockchain,
which continues to exist to this day and as of writing tends to
stick near 5 percent the network value of Ethereum.
The site for Ethereum Classic defines the cryptoasset as “a
continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain—the classic
version preserving untampered history; free from external
interference and subjective tampering of transactions.
{{#}}8221;
While The DAO may have been a disaster, the concept of a
decentralized autonomous organization is generalizable past
this single instance. The innovative investor should expect to
31
32
33

see similar concepts coming to market over the years with
their own cryptotokens and should know that not all DAOs or
dApps with cryptotokens are similarly shaky.
For example, a fully functional decentralized insurance
company, Airbnb, or Uber all hold great promise, and
developer teams are working on similar use cases. One can
think of an Airbnb or Uber as a middleman, connecting the
consumer and provider of a service, and then taking a 20 to 30
percent fee for doing so. While many merchants
understandably complain about credit card fees of 2 to 3
percent, the “platform fees” of Airbnb, Uber, and similar
platform services are borderline egregious. Many of the
cryptotoken systems that are imitating such platforms plan to
take a fee that is an order of magnitude less, using underlying
blockchain architectures to facilitate the decentralized transfer
of value and services. Many of these systems have their own
cryptotokens and will run on Ethereum or a similar platform.
However, some will be much better constructed than others,
and it is unlikely that Ethereum, or platforms like it, will help
dApps in future debacles.
DECENTRALIZED PLATFORMS TO
PREDICT THE FUTURE
One of the more interesting dApps in development uses
Ethereum’s blockchain to facilitate prediction markets. The
company Augur seeks to provide a platform that allows users
to wager on the results of any event, creating a market for
people to test their predictions.  Hence the term “prediction
market.” For instance, if someone had sought to predict
34

whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton would win the 2016
U.S. presidential election, he or she could have used Augur to
create a prediction market and wager against others on the
outcome (if the service had been up and running at the time).
Augur uses a cryptotoken, which it calls Reputation (REP),
to incentivize people to report on the outcomes of events
truthfully. These reporters are different from the people
wagering on the outcome of events. The problem with a
decentralized prediction market is that there’s no centralized
authority on the outcome of events. Augur uses REP to reward
people who report truthfully and penalize those who lie. Augur
explains it as follows:
Those who hold Reputation are expected to report accurately on the
outcome of randomly selected events within Augur every few weeks. If
holders fail to report accurately on the outcome of an event, or attempt to be
dishonest—the Augur system redistributes the bad reporter’s Reputation to
those who have reported accurately during the same reporting cycle.
Augur conducted its own crowdfunding effort in 2015,
selling 80 percent of a fixed supply of 11 million REP. In so
doing, it raised over $5 million to fund the creation of the
platform. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, which is one of
the largest companies in the cryptoasset sector, has called it an
“awesome project with huge potential.”  Even Vitalik Buterin
acknowledged its potential when he called it an “Uber for
knowledge.”
Augur is one of the clearest uses of cryptotokens, and its
potential success could set the stage for even more
implementations of crypotokens in the future. A similar
prediction market system, Gnosis, held a crowdsale in April
2017 raising money at an implied valuation north of $300
million.

A GROWING WEB OF
CRYPTOCOMMODITIES AND
CRYPTOTOKENS
While Ethereum has a robust community building on it,
several similar platforms have taken note of its success. The
aforementioned Dfinity, Lisk, Rootstock, Tezos, and Waves as
of writing all are at different stages of development, between
pre-crowdsale to already operating in the wild, and offer their
own variations of a decentralized world computer.
Rootstock, similar to Counterparty, intends to run on
Bitcoin. Rootstock is led by Sergio Lerner, who specialized in
IT security for much of his life, and when he first came to
Bitcoin audited many aspects of the code. He now leads a
team that is basically building Ethereum on Bitcoin, and the
system will be compatible with all dApps that run on
Ethereum. Just as Ethereum has ether, Rootstock will have its
own native currency called RSK.
While some posit that Rootstock will be a significant
competitor to Ethereum,  we think the two will coexist and
provide healthy redundancy. Having two or more widely
recognized decentralized world computers to run on will make
dApps more resilient to disruptions. If one network is
experiencing severe trouble, then a dApp can replicate its state
on another similar platform, and from then on process all
transactions through that platform. While the transition would
likely induce harrowing market volatility, such optionality
means that dApps are not beholden to the platforms they build
upon.
Lastly, at the risk of confusing the innovative investor, we
38

should add that a dApp may use many cryptocommodities
simultaneously, but for different infrastructural purposes. For
example, a dApp may use a decentralized cloud storage
system like Filecoin to store large amounts of data, and
another cryptocommodity for anonymized bandwidth, in
addition to using Ethereum to process certain operations.
For such bleeding-edge platforms, it is most important for
the innovative investor to keep track of developer mindshare
and miner support. Both are vital to the long-term growth and
survival of these platforms. Developers will quickly iterate and
fix bugs, while miners will provide the hardware and resources
necessary to computationally secure the platform. Since these
are decentralized systems operating in the wild, they need to
move fast and be properly secured. Only then will other
developers build dApps on them.
Now that the innovative investor has an understanding of
what these assets are, we want to move into why that investor
should consider placing them in his or her investment
portfolio. Although cryptoassets are creating a rapidly
evolving and somewhat complex future, investment tenets that
have stood the test of time still apply. Returning to the
fundamentals of investment theory will allow innovative
investors to properly position their overarching portfolio to
take advantage of the growth of cryptoassets responsibly.

Part II
WHY

I
Chapter 6
The Importance of Portfolio
Management and Alternative
Assets
(Jack) was a columnist at MarketWatch.com in August 2013,
when I made the logical leap to add bitcoin to my portfolio.
While initially born of curiosity, my interest in bitcoin had
grown more mature and serious with each passing month. As a
writer focused on retirement, I decided that I could only
recommend the asset to others if I had the courage to put it in
my own retirement portfolio.
Not only did I decide to invest in bitcoin, I decided to place
the entirety of that year’s allocation for my Simplified
Employee Pension (SEP) plan into bitcoin. When I announced
what I had done in my article “Do Bitcoins Belong in your
Retirement Portfolio?,”  it created a stir online and in the
financial planning community. My writing over the years had
consistently discussed the need to remain prudent when
making investment decisions, rationally building portfolios
that balanced risks and returns.
A balanced approach to investing grew from my experience
1

as a financial consultant. I come from a background of not
only working within companies in the financial community,
but also from nearly a decade of working directly with regular
investors who are trying to accomplish their financial goals
and objectives. I have sat around hundreds of kitchen tables
with my clients and near-clients, explaining my belief that
their personal dreams of retirement or sending their children to
college could be accomplished by following a discipline of
saving and proper asset allocation. I believe in the power of
building a prudent portfolio based upon the needs and risks of
each individual client.
To some, my decision to invest in bitcoin flew in the face
of my own advice. I may have managed portfolios in a prudent
manner for myself and others, but my interest in new
technologies in the past made me no stranger to criticism.
During the dot-com days, I made (and lost) a sizeable amount
of money investing in companies that flew high in terms of
valuation only to crash on the shores of reality as they were
little more than business facades. Was I chasing a similar
crash-and-burn scenario with bitcoin? Even my
technologically and investment savvy son, Eric, initially
criticized me about bitcoin. “They have these things called
dollar bills, Dad. Stick to using those.”
However, I saw real potential in the virtual currency. Over
the months I spent evaluating it, I analyzed bitcoin the same
way I analyzed every other asset I added to my own or a
client’s portfolio, just as I had done over the last 30 years. I
carefully considered and quantified bitcoin’s market behavior
(using the tools that follow), so I knew what beast I was
dealing with. I ruminated on the percentage of my portfolio I
2

could responsibly allocate to it, with the overarching goal of
sensible asset allocation among stocks, bonds, and alternative
assets. Then, I investigated the mechanics of putting bitcoin
into a retirement account. The overall process of analyzing an
asset was the same; I’d done it countless times before. The
only difference this time was that it was bitcoin.
MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY
When evaluating any investment decision, the starting point is
always an individual’s financial goals, time horizon, and risk
tolerance. Goals are what the funds will be used for, and the
time horizon reveals when they will be used. Risk tolerance
takes a bit more analysis. Each investor has a unique tolerance
for the ongoing gyrations of the value of his or her portfolio.
For example, do people lose sleep when their portfolio
fluctuates, or do they slumber through ups and downs,
dreaming of long-term gains? Once goals, time horizon, and
risk tolerance are determined, one can proceed to developing
an investment portfolio that maximizes returns while staying
within the bounds of these parameters.
Nobel Prize winner Harry Max Markowitz defined an
approach to constructing portfolios in 1952 that has been the
model that most advisors and investors have followed since.
His Nobel Prize winning effort created modern portfolio
theory (MPT), which provides for the construction of
investment portfolios that maximize expected returns based
upon a targeted level of risk. His efforts showed that higher
returns are achieved by taking on higher risk, while also
recognizing what he called an efficient frontier, which defines

the maximum possible expected return for a given level of
risk.
The key for any investor employing MPT is to explicitly
consider risk. While risk is not a palatable thought for retail
investors—many of whom prefer to dream of risk-free
million-dollar returns—there can be no reward without risk.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates
securities markets in the United States, has this advice about
risk for investors:
When it comes to investing, risk and reward are inextricably entwined.
You’ve probably heard the phrase “no pain, no gain.” Those words come
close to summing up the relationship between risk and reward. Don’t let
anyone tell you otherwise. All investments involve some degree of risk. If
you intend to purchase securities—such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds—
it’s important that you understand before you invest that you could lose
some or all of your money. The reward for taking on risk is the potential for
a greater investment return.
We’ll tackle the specifics of quantifying risk shortly,
mainly through a discussion of volatility. Similarly, we will
dive into how to approach absolute returns and the returns per
unit of volatility, or risk-reward ratio.
While it’s vital to understand the individual attributes of
each asset in a portfolio, MPT goes beyond single assets to
emphasize a holistic approach to the risks and returns of the
overall portfolio. The same can be said of how a coach
approaches any team. Understanding the strengths and
weaknesses of each team member is important, but it’s more
important to understand how the team members play together.
Great teams can be composed of average players, while a
disjointed combination of great players can make average
teams.
3

Markowitz’s efficient frontier, which maximizes returns for
a given level of risk, is reached by smartly combining assets in
a portfolio. A savvy combination of assets can actually
decrease the risk of the portfolio to a lower level than any
single asset in the portfolio (other than risk-free issues), which
is one of the areas in which cryptoassets become particularly
noteworthy. We will return to how an investor can craft such a
portfolio after we outline the three core characteristics of
individual assets.
Standard Deviation
Standard deviation of returns, or the range that an asset’s price
will vary from its mean value, is one of the most common
measures of risk. While Markowitz’s approach makes clear the
need for risk in a portfolio, most investors are risk-averse to
one degree or another, and so they must be compelled by the
potential for increased reward if they are to increase their risk.
To help with the anxiety of risk, MPT defines it quantitatively,
removing much of the uncertainty. Typically, simply being
well informed lets investors sleep better at night.
The standard deviation of returns draws from the statistics
of normal bell curves. If the average value, or mean, of a bell
curve is 10 and its standard deviation is 5, then 68 percent of
the time a randomly chosen entity from the sample will fall
between 5 and 15. Five is one standard deviation to the left of
10, and 15 is one standard deviation to the right of 10. Due to
the way normal curves work, 95 percent of the time a random
sample will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so
between 0 and 20 for our example. This is illustrated in Figure
6.1.

Figure 6.1 
 A standard deviation bell curve

For example, take a stock that has an expected return
(mean) of 7 percent and a 5 percent standard deviation of
expected returns. There is a 68 percent probability that this
stock will yield returns between 2 and 12 percent in the
upcoming year. With a less aggressive asset, say a bond that
has an expected return of 4 percent and standard deviation of 1
percent, then 68 percent of the time it can be expected to yield
between 3 and 5 percent in the coming year. There is less
potential for both upside and downside with the bond, whereas

the stock has much more potential for some great years, but
also the potential risk of seriously dreary years. Hence, the
standard deviation of expected returns informs investors of the
amount of risk they’re taking if they were to hold only that
asset.
For a more holistic view, compare a portfolio with a
standard deviation of returns of 4 percent to one that has a
standard deviation of 8 percent. If both portfolios have the
same expected return of 7 percent, it wouldn’t be a prudent
decision to invest in the portfolio with more volatility, as they
both have the same expected return. Taking on a higher level
of risk has no benefit in this light, and if a portfolio is
unwisely constructed, investors can end up taking on more risk
than they’re compensated for.
Sharpe Ratio
Similar to the concepts behind MPT, the Sharpe ratio was also
created by a Nobel Prize winner, William F. Sharpe. The
Sharpe ratio differs from the standard deviation of returns in
that it calibrates returns per the unit of risk taken. The ratio
divides the average expected return of an asset (minus the risk-
free rate) by its standard deviation of returns. For example, if
the expected return is 8 percent, and the standard deviation of
returns is 5 percent, then its Sharpe ratio is 1.6. The higher the
Sharpe ratio, the better an asset is compensating an investor
for the associated risk. An asset with a negative Sharpe ratio is
punishing the investor with negative returns and volatility.
Importantly, absolute returns are only half the story for the
Sharpe ratio. An asset with lower absolute returns can have a
higher Sharpe ratio than a high-flying asset that experiences

extreme volatility. For example, consider an equity asset that
has an expected return of 12 percent with a volatility of 10
percent, versus a bond with an expected return of 5 percent but
volatility of 3 percent. The former has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2
while the latter of 1.67 (assuming a risk-free rate of 0 percent).
The ratio provides a mathematical method to compare how
different assets compensate the investor for the risk taken,
making bonds and equities, or apples and oranges, more
comparable.
Correlation of Returns and the Efficient Frontier
One of the key breakthroughs of modern portfolio theory was
to show that a riskier asset can be added to a portfolio, and if
its behavior differs significantly from the preexisting assets in
that portfolio, it can actually decrease the overall risk of the
portfolio. How can a risky asset make a portfolio less risky?
The key is correlation of returns.
Correlation simply measures how assets move in relation to
one another. The measurement ranges from a value of +1 to
−1. If assets are perfectly positively correlated, then they move
in tandem: if one is up 10 percent, the other is up 10 percent as
well, for a score of +1. Similarly, if they are perfectly
negatively correlated at −1, then when one is up 10 percent the
other will be down 10 percent. If there is zero correlation, then
the assets are completely independent, and how one asset is
behaving in the market has no bearing on the other.
Stocks and bonds are often the major tools advisors and
investors use to reduce risk as they try to build portfolios made
up of assets with low correlations. Historically, stocks and
bonds have moved differently from each other. When the

economy is strong and stocks are generally rising, money
flows out of bonds as investors fear they’re missing out,
causing bond prices to slump and stocks to go higher.
Investors are alive and well, with risk-on attitudes. When stock
prices falter, investors become concerned by the potential
losses, and money flows from stocks into the relative safety of
bonds, known as a flight to safety. Such risk-off markets
depress the price of stocks and float the price of bonds.
The two assets move in different directions based on the
same news. They act almost like two people on a seesaw. This
historical balancing of risk between stocks and bonds should
be done as precisely as possible, otherwise wild market swings
one way or the other will have a painful impact on the
innovative investor’s portfolio.
Combining assets that have a variety of correlations makes
it possible to create a portfolio that can perform in both bull
and bear markets. Just because a few players are feeling sick
doesn’t mean the whole team has to fail. One of the crown
jewels of Markowitz’s MPT was his concept of the efficient
frontier, which indicates where a portfolio can provide the best
expectation of return for its level of risk (see Figure 6.2). The
use of this concept is valuable for building portfolios because
it helps to visualize how some groups of assets won’t provide
enough return for the risk taken.

Within the financial services industry, people talk about
risk in two ways: systematic and unsystematic. Systematic risk
is the risk inherent to investing in assets subject to the effects
of macroeconomic events—like global gross domestic product
(GDP) growth, trade relations, warfare, and so on. It is also
known as undiversifiable risk because all assets are affected by
it. Unsystematic risk, on the other hand, is the risk specific to
each individual investment, such as market sector,
management, product expansion, geographic exposure, and so
on. It is also known as firm-specific risk and can be neutralized

with a smartly constructed portfolio.
Unsystematic risk can be mitigated by constructing a
portfolio of assets that neutralizes different firm-specific risks
that could impact a portfolio. Ideally, the portfolio is crafted so
that when one investment is negatively hurt by a specific
event, another asset potentially could benefit by that very same
event. For example, if a carbon tax is put on industry in the
United States, then companies that are purely involved in oil
and coal procurement may be adversely hit, while solar
companies may jump. This carbon tax is not a systematic risk
if it doesn’t affect the market as a whole. Instead, it is an
unsystematic risk that influences specific companies within the
markets. In this case, the stocks of the oil company and the
solar company would be examples of assets that experience
negative correlation of returns to this event.
What holds true for specific assets within the same asset
class also holds true between the asset classes themselves. If
unsystematic risk is fully neutralized by constructing a
portfolio of assets and asset classes that have low to negative
correlation of returns, then that portfolio will be exposed only
to systematic risk. Modern portfolio theory takes it a step
further by saying over the long term, investors are rewarded
only for the systematic risk they take on and will be adversely
affected over the long run if they leave themselves exposed to
unsystematic risk.
With the tools of MPT it’s possible to construct a portfolio
that stays within an investor’s risk profile while still
generating returns sufficient to meet long-term financial goals
and objectives. The innovative investor recognizes that the
overall risk of his or her portfolio can be reduced by including

assets that are uncorrelated to the traditional capital markets,
such as bitcoin and its digital siblings.
TRADITIONAL ASSET ALLOCATION
For many years, traditional asset allocation models strictly
focused on defining percentages of a portfolio in either stocks
or bonds. For instance, the American Association of Individual
Investors provides simplified models for three types of
investors:
•   Aggressive investors: 90 percent diversified stock and
10 percent fixed income
•   Moderate investors: 70 percent diversified stock and 30
percent fixed income
•   Conservative investors: 50 percent diversified stock
and 50 percent fixed income
These three simple models can be used by people of different
ages who have different investment time horizons. A whole
host of equities can be included within “diversified stock,” and
even more so for the variety of bonds that can be used for
“fixed income.” For example, equities can be considered based
on the size of the company, the growth characteristics, the
valuation, the sector type, geographic exposure, and so on.
Similarly, bonds can include government or corporate issues,
with varying durations, credit ratings, and tax advantages.
This traditional approach to asset allocation ran aground in
2008, when the financial markets collapsed and investors
found that even if they had both stocks and bonds in their
portfolio, they all fell together.  The average investor felt
4
5

betrayed by the tried and trusted model of stocks and bonds
moving in a noncorrelated fashion. The crash of 2008 shook
these investors from their “economic lullaby.”  In an
increasingly globalized world where capital market assets are
more closely intertwined, it was becoming clear that twentieth-
century diversification models wouldn’t cut it for twenty-first-
century investing.
While the crash of 2008 was felt by most everyone, it soon
surfaced that some people had not only weathered the storm
but made significant money by leveraging the strong winds of
fortune.  Hedge fund managers who had been operating in
relative secrecy were now being named as the new “masters of
the universe” for their ability to avoid much of the damage of
the crash and, for some, to profit greatly from it.
THE RISE OF ALTERNATIVE
INVESTMENTS
The financial crisis of 2008 caused many financial advisors
and wealth managers to evaluate different approaches to
portfolio construction other than solely stocks and bonds. The
returns seen by hedge funds during the crisis were identified as
examples where nontraditional and alternative investment
vehicles had provided positive (in some cases, drastically so)
performance returns.
John Paulson became the face of hedge fund billionaires
who benefited from the crisis when it was revealed that he had
personally earned over $1 billion from his fund management,
including the Paulson Advantage Plus Fund (an event-driven
fund). This fund alone ranked number one over the period of
6
7

2006 to 2008 with an annualized return of nearly 63 percent.
Equally successful was James Simons’s Renaissance
Technologies Medallion Fund with a return of 80 percent in
2008. Becoming a hedge fund manager became all the rage for
business-minded students when it was revealed that the top 25
hedge fund managers had earned a total of $22.3 billion in
2007 and $11.6 billion in 2008.
With numbers like these, the world of hedge funds caught
the attention of the media. Investors questioned if these
managers had something to do with the crash.  They also
wanted to know what they were doing differently and whether
it was something they could do as well.
First, let’s understand what we mean by a hedge fund and
how they differ among themselves. It’s difficult to lump hedge
funds together in one group, as they often have different
investment objectives and approaches. Historically, one of the
easiest ways to spot hedge funds has been their high fee
structure. For example, many hedge funds operate under a 2
and 20 model, or sometimes 3 and 30, where they charge a 2
percent annual management fee and take 20 percent of the
profits from a year. Other common characteristics include their
exclusivity and general secrecy.
Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, investors who took
advantage of hedge fund performance and the alternative
investments they utilized were typically of ultra-high net
worth with sizeable investable assets, given that often the
minimum investment was $1 million or more to gain entry.
Additionally, investors had to tie up their funds for lengthy
periods as part of the agreement with the hedge fund manager.
While mutual funds provide a prospectus that outlines
8
9

exactly the approach and asset classes to be used, hedge funds
are often veiled in secrecy. They might publicly advertise a
broad investment strategy, but specifics are often withheld to
preserve the secret sauce of the hedge fund. Hedge fund
managers demand a high amount of flexibility and tolerance
from their clients.
For example, hedge fund managers could buy real estate or
take ownership in what they believe to be an undervalued
company (either publicly or privately held). If they believe
upcoming political changes may favor oil, they could lease oil
tankers or make a sizeable investment in a foreign oil
partnership. They can also utilize assets such as timber, short
positions in stocks (meaning they’re betting on the price
falling), commodity derivatives, and yes, germane to this
book, bitcoin and other cryptoassets.
Even with this lack of transparency and liquidity, affluent
investors rushed to hedge funds to chase the performance of
managers like Paulson, Simons, and others. An underlying
assumption for hedge fund investors was that they needed to
be affluent enough to handle the high risk and volatile nature
associated with a hedge fund manager’s approach and fund
assets. For the typical investor, the high asset commitments,
illiquidity, and lack of transparency kept hedge funds beyond
their reach. Fortunately, the underlying ability to utilize
alternative investments in any portfolio is not as elusive as
many are made to think.
Alternative Investments Defined
So how does one define an “alternative investment”?
A search online and in dictionaries will present a reader

with the perception that accurately defining the term is quite
complicated due to the wide range of investments included,
ranging from hedge funds to private equity to direct
investments in natural resources like gold and timber.
The reality is that classifying alternative investments can be
a moving target as investment options and trends change over
time. Many investors may already have alternative investment
vehicles in their portfolio without specifically referring to
them as such. An investment such as an exchange traded fund
(ETF) that specializes in arbitrage strategies or futures
contracts may look like any other ETF in a portfolio, but it
could be considered an alternative investment.  Physical
holdings in gold, silver, real estate, art collections, or
personally-owned businesses are all part of someone’s net
worth and could also be considered as alternative investments.
A more current and concise way to describe an alternative
investment is that it’s an asset with its own unique economic
and value-based characteristics that are separate from those of
the primary investments of stocks and bonds. For an investor,
the main concern is to have assets that perform in a
noncorrelated fashion to stocks and bonds—which have
historically made up most investors’ portfolio models—and
many alternative assets fit that bill.
If done properly, when the overall market has a severe
meltdown as happened in 2008, specific alternative
investments within portfolios may not decrease. Equally, in
market upturns those same assets may or may not also increase
in value; they may lose value, but such is the cost of overall
risk reduction. As a small portion of the innovative investor’s
overall portfolio, alternatives are an effective way to balance
10
11

risk and provide a cushion in the case of a stock or bond
meltdown.
ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS AND THE
INNOVATIVE INVESTOR
Today’s innovative investor can build an investment portfolio
and asset allocation strategy with a clear understanding of risk
and reward, and the inclusion of alternative investments can
help. This has not been lost on wealth management firms that
are now looking more aggressively into how alternative
investments can be used to improve client returns.
For example, Morgan Stanley has outlined asset allocation
models for its high net worth investors with under $25 million
in investable assets; those models recommend 56 percent
stocks, 19 percent bonds, 3 percent cash, and 22 percent
alternatives. For those clients with over $25 million in
investable assets, the recommendation is for 50 percent stocks,
19 percent bonds, 3 percent cash, and 28 percent in
alternatives.  Merrill Lynch has recommended allocation
models for its typical client that include alternatives near or
above 20 percent of a portfolio.
Clearly, the inclusion of alternative investments should not
be limited to only high net worth investors. Historically, one
of the biggest reasons alternative investments have not been
incorporated into retail portfolios is because of their illiquid
characteristics. Many retail investors can’t guarantee that they
won’t need to access their funds for 10 years, making many
alternatives out of reach. That, however, is changing.
Over the last decade, to address the need for alternative
12
13

investment options as a way to provide diversification and
noncorrelation from the traditional capital markets, wealth
management firms have been creating more investment
options for the typical investor. The proliferation of ETFs has
led to the creation of liquid investments in alternative assets,
such as gold, energy resources, and real estate, as well as ways
to play the volatility of the market. Because of the easy
accessibility of these products through the capital markets,
these vehicles and others have found their way into investors’
portfolios and onto the recommended lists of many financial
advisors. The impact of this is seen in a 2015 survey among
financial advisors that found they had placed 73 percent of
their clients in alternative investments, and that nearly three-
quarters of advisors planned to maintain their current
alternative investment allocations.
The survey also showed that in terms of asset allocation,
most advisors were recommending a range of 6 percent to 15
percent of a client’s portfolio in alternatives. A smaller but not
insignificant percentage of advisors recommended 16 percent
to 25 percent of their clients’ portfolios in alternatives.
Bitcoin and other cryptoassets are alternative assets that can
be safely and successfully incorporated into well-diversified
portfolios to meet these asset allocation recommendations.
However, every alternative investment has its unique set of
characteristics, and the innovative investor must understand
these.
The potential of bitcoin and other cryptoassets is so great
that we believe they should be considered an asset class of
their own. We can easily see them more and more commonly
used in many innovative portfolios. We explain why we think
14
15

cryptoassets will increasingly be incorporated into mainstream
retail portfolios, first starting with an exploration of how
bitcoin’s risk, reward, and risk-reward profiles have evolved
over the course of its life.

The Most Compelling
Alternative Asset of the
Twenty-First Century
itcoin is the most exciting alternative asset in the twenty-first
century, and it has paved the way for its digital siblings to
enjoy similar success. In this chapter, we dive into how bitcoin
evolved as an asset in the context of absolute returns,
volatility, and correlations, concluding with how a small
allocation of bitcoin would have affected a portfolio over
different holding periods. Because bitcoin can claim the title
of being the oldest cryptoasset—giving us the most data to
investigate its maturation—understanding its longitudinal
market behavior will give us a window into how other
cryptoassets may evolve over time.
BITCOIN’S EARLIEST PRICING
Let’s go back to the first time a price was established for
bitcoin, October 5, 2009, when it was priced at 1,309 bitcoin
to the dollar, or 7/100 of a cent per bitcoin. A small website

called the New Liberty Standard established the rate based on
the amount of money it needed for electricity and rent to
maintain the computer that mined bitcoin versus the amount of
bitcoin that had been reaped from so doing.
If at that time an investor had tracked down one of the few
bitcoin miners in the world and offered $100 for the 130,900
bitcoin implied by that exchange rate, by now that investor
would have amassed over $100 million. A single hundred-
dollar bill converted into one million hundred-dollar bills: it
would have been one of the best investments of all time.
However, having such impeccable timing is an elusive
dream for investors. When I (Jack) began investigating bitcoin
in August 2013,  bitcoin was trading at $135; it had already
appreciated significantly from the initial exchange rate of
1,309 bitcoin to the dollar. Yet I decided it was not too late
and ultimately made the investment.
Similarly, I (Chris) didn’t even consider investing in bitcoin
when I first heard about it in 2012. By the time I began
considering bitcoin for my portfolio in late 2014, the price was
in the mid $300s, having increased 460,000-fold from the
initial exchange rate. Like Jack, I also didn’t think it was too
late and made the jump. While the innovative investor may
interpret the current price tag on bitcoin as being too high,
consider instead what can be done. We believe it’s still early
days for cryptoassets.
ABSOLUTE RETURNS
To provide context for bitcoin’s behavior in the first eight
years of its life, we will compare it to other popular
1

investments from both traditional and alternative asset classes.
In terms of absolute returns, long-term comparisons between
bitcoin and many other assets make most jaws drop, but it’s
important to keep endpoint sensitivity in mind. Endpoint
sensitivity refers to the starting and ending dates chosen for
comparison, because over time almost all assets fluctuate
considerably in value. Choosing a low starting point and a
high ending point will yield drastically different comparisons
than a high starting point and low ending point.
We have chosen January 3, 2017, as the ending point of
analysis for this chapter, as that was bitcoin’s eight-year
birthday. While designating a fixed endpoint, we have the
flexibility to choose different starting points (including one of
bitcoin’s most notable peaks in late 2013). By illustrating both
high and low starting points, we are able to show the variety of
experiences investors could have had depending on when they
first bought bitcoin. For those concerned with the cherry-
picking of numbers, it should be noted that on January 3,
2017, the price of bitcoin was around $1,000, whereas when
this book was entering its final stages of editing, bitcoin had
risen past $3,000. We nonetheless have stuck with the $1,000
price of bitcoin for the following comparison in pursuit of
intellectual honesty.
To begin with, we examine the longest-term bitcoin prices
we have that come from reliable exchange data. Figure 7.1
provides a comparison of bitcoin versus three of the most
important stock market indices: the S&P 500, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DJIA), and the NASDAQ 100,
respectively. It assumes a $100 investment was made on July
19, 2010, a few days after Mt. Gox was officially open for

business and providing the first widely used exchange services
for bitcoin.
Figure 7.1  Bitcoin’s performance compared to major U.S. stock indices since the
start of Mt. Gox
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesks
These broad market indices represent how the stock
markets performed on average, with the S&P 500 representing
approximately 80 percent coverage of available U.S. equity
market capitalization,  the DJIA for 30 of the largest U.S.
stocks by market capitalization,  and the NASDAQ 100 for
big domestic and international companies in sectors that
include computer hardware and software, telecommunications,
and biotechnology.  Note that the graph uses a log scale for
the y-axis so that the broad market indices can be seen—in
other words, they’d be invisible on a linear scale.

Since July 2010, the three broad indices have done well,
with U.S. stocks in a recovery bull market after the financial
crisis of 2008. An initial investment of $100 would have
grown to $242, $231, and $291, for the S&P 500, DJIA, and
NASDAQ 100, respectively. Although equity market returns
have been respectable, they have been dwarfed by bitcoin,
which has done phenomenally in the same period—an initial
investment of $100 grew to nearly $1.3 million by the
beginning of January 2017.
LINEAR VS. LOGARITHMIC
Two types of scales are commonly used for representing
the change in the price of assets: linear and logarithmic.
Linear price scales show unadjusted unit changes in the y-
axis. For example, if priced in dollars, $10 in value
increase will look the same, whether the asset goes from
$10 to $20 or $100 to $110. Logarithmic scales adjust the
y-axis—in finance most commonly by factors of 10—
which allows percent price increases to be compared. For
example, on a logarithmic y-axis the price move from $10
to $20 will show up more clearly than the move from $100
to $110, because the former represents a 100 percent price
increase while the latter is only a 10 percent price increase.
What would look the same on a logarithmic scale,
however, is a move from $10 to $20 and a move from
$100 to $200. Logarithmic price scales are useful in
comparing percent price changes over time, as well as
compressing data of widely different values into one chart.
We can also compare these indices to bitcoin by calculating

the compound annual growth rates, or the annual appreciation
year-over-year. In this comparison, the post-crisis bull market
performance is clear, as the S&P 500 provided nearly 15
percent compound annual returns, 50 percent better than the
average 9.5 percent it provided investors in the 88 years
between 1928 and 2016.  Figure 7.2 shows that in spite of the
excellent performance of U.S. stock markets, bitcoin was a
clear standout in this eight-year period with compound annual
returns of 332 percent.
Figure 7.2  Bitcoin’s compound annual returns versus major U.S. stock indices
since the start of Mt. Gox
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Rather than comparing bitcoin to broad market indices, it
may be more fair to compare it to high growth companies
riding similar waves of technological innovation. The FANG
stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google have been
5

the darling of many tech analysts over the last few years,
outperforming the broad market indices and helping to reshape
our increasingly digital world. However, as Figure 7.3 shows,
even the FANG stocks were wildly outperformed by bitcoin
since Facebook’s May 2012 initial public offering (IPO).
Once again, note that this chart uses a log scale for the y-axis.
Figure 7.3  Bitcoin’s performance compared to the FANG stocks since
Facebook’s IPO
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
An initial investment of $100 on the day Facebook
completed its IPO would have turned into $306, $352, $1,276,
and $262 for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google,
respectively, by our end date of January 3, 2017. When
matched up against these stellar tech names, bitcoin has
6

performed more than an order of magnitude better, with an
initial investment of $100 growing to $20,133. On a relative
basis, bitcoin has provided capital appreciation 66-fold, 57-
fold, 16-fold, and 77-fold that of the FANG stocks,
respectively, over this period.
To provide better context and make the performance of the
FANG stocks comparable to the performance of the broad
market indices, we can once again convert the above returns
into a compound annual rate, as seen in Figure 7.4. Doing so
reveals that the FANG names have provided annual returns
about double that of the broad market indices over the last few
years, with Netflix as the standout for the group. Yet when
compared with bitcoin, every other investment pales.
Figure 7.4  Bitcoin’s compound annual returns versus the FANG stocks since
Facebook’s IPO
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Remember that, as of January 2017, bitcoin’s network

value was 1/20, 1/22, 1/3, and 1/33 that of the FANG stocks
respectively. Therefore, if bitcoin is to grow to a similar size,
much opportunity remains. Clearly, it’s still early days for
bitcoin, and even earlier days for its digital siblings.
If the preceding log graphs all looked relatively similar,
that’s because they were. Bitcoin’s ascent dwarfed that of
other assets, and that’s on a log scale y-axis. If the y-axis is
linear instead, then all the previous graphs condense into
Figure 7.5, with Netflix as the only name that moderately
differentiates from the rest. We also added assets outside of
U.S. equities, including U.S. bonds, U.S. real estate, gold, and
oil.  Gold and oil investors received a doubly short end of the
stick, as by January 3, 2017, they had lost 30 percent and 40
percent of their value, respectively. All other assets provided
positive returns since Facebook’s IPO.

Figure 7.5  Bitcoin’s ascent versus other major asset classes
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
At this point, innovative investors might ask what if they
didn’t buy at bitcoin’s inception or at Facebook’s IPO? Let’s
address this concern directly by going back to our prior
discussion of endpoint sensitivity and seeing what would have
happened if an investor had picked the worst time to buy
bitcoin: at the peak of its astronomical ascent in late 2013.
Worst-Case Scenario for Absolute Returns: Buying at the Top
In late 2013, bitcoin’s network value was over $10 billion,
making it a significantly investable asset for retail investors
even by capital market standards. On November 29, 2013,

bitcoin reached $1,242, making one bitcoin worth more than
one ounce of gold.
Clearly, bitcoin had risen a long way from its humble roots.
If innovative investors had bought at this peak price, their
returns would not have been nearly as rosy as if they had
bought when Mt. Gox launched or when Facebook IPO’d. In
fact, they would have endured an 80 percent loss in value over
the following year before bitcoin bottomed in January 2015
and began a long, slow climb back to previous highs. By
January 3, 2017, $100 invested in bitcoin at its peak price
would only retain $83, while an investment instrument based
on the S&P 500, DJIA, or NASDAQ 100 indices would have
grown to $133, $133, and $146, respectively (Figure 7.6).
Figure 7.6  Bitcoin’s performance compared to major U.S. stock indices since its
November 2013 peak Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
8

An investor who purchased bitcoin at its peak on November
29, 2013, rather than one of the FANG stocks would have
suffered an even more drastic differential in returns. As shown
in Figure 7.7, the capital appreciation provided by Facebook,
Amazon, Netflix, and Google would have been 3-fold, 2.3-
fold, 2.9-fold, and 1.8-fold that of bitcoin during this time
period. While innovative investors who had gotten into bitcoin
soon after Facebook IPO’d would have been rewarded for
their decision, if they had waited a year and a half they would
have been dealing with a vastly different story.
Figure 7.7 
 Bitcoin’s performance compared to the FANG stocks since its
November 2013 peak
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
At that same peak in price, innovative investors who chose

bitcoin over a nonequity holding—such as bonds, real estate,
gold, or oil—would have been the most at peace with their
decision (Figure 7.8). The performance of commodities like
gold and oil have been far from stellar since November 2013,
and in the period up to January 2017, bitcoin actually
outperformed oil. The low interest rate environment meant
bonds conserved investors’ capital but didn’t grow it much. In
this group, U.S. real estate was the only investment that
appreciated on par with the equity markets.
Figure 7.8  Bitcoin’s performance compared to nonequity assets since its
November 2013 peak
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
At this point, we have provided insight into some of
bitcoin’s best and worst returns in its relatively short life.
However, throughout this book we will be making the case

that we believe there is much more price appreciation potential
yet to come from both bitcoin and select cryptocurrencies,
cryptocommodities, and cryptotokens.
Dollar cost averaging is a means by which the innovative
investor can avoid extreme sensitivity to the starting point of
investing. As opposed to taking a big chunk of money and
dumping it all into an investment at once, it often behooves the
investor to average in, deploying capital at a measured
cadence. In so doing, the investor may buy at the peak but will
also be buying all the way to the bottom, ultimately averaging
a good price if the underlying investment has long-term
potential for capital appreciation.
VOLATILITY
While absolute returns are often the topic of trending
conversation, if unaccompanied by an investigation of
volatility, investors may be overpaying in risk for their returns.
Put another way, they may be undercompensated for the risk
they’re taking. In this sense, innovative investors must make
sure they’re being rewarded for the risk in their portfolio.
WHY CRYPTOASSETS ARE TYPICALLY VOLATILE WHEN FIRST
LAUNCHED
Upon launch, cryptoassets tend to be extremely volatile
because they are thinly traded markets. A thin market
refers to the size of the order book, and an order book
refers to the list of buys and sells on an exchange. In other
words, it’s a measure of the number of people wanting to
buy and sell at any given moment. Figure 7.9 is an image

of an order book for Ethereum (ether) on Poloniex, a
widely used cryptoasset exchange.


Figure 7.9 
 Order book of buys and sells for ether on Poloniex
Used with permission from Poloniex.com
Each order is one row in an order book, and so the more
orders there are, the thicker the book. If there aren’t many
buys and sells, then the order book is thin. That said, some
orders also need to be of sizeable amounts. If all the orders
consist of bids to buy or sell $1 of the asset, then it doesn’t
matter how many orders there are, it will still be a thin
order book.
The thinness of the order book is also referred to as the
liquidity of the market. If the market is highly liquid, then
there are lots of orders and many of them are likely large.
In this case, value can be traded easily. If the market is
illiquid, or thin, then sizeable price swings with low
volume will occur because someone trying to buy (or sell)
a lot of the asset will fill all the available sell (or buy)
orders, which drives the price up (or down). As a result, in
thin or illiquid markets, when investors are bullish they
can drive massive swings to the upside, just as when
investors turn bearish, strong selling volume can quickly
drive the price down.
When cryptoassets are first launched, they have
relatively thin order books because the investor base is
typically smaller, trading is more infrequent, and orders
may be small. This can create volatility in the price of the
new asset. However, as news of the asset’s merit spreads,
interest will increase along with trading volume. The order
book will typically fatten and volatility will often decrease.

Figure 7.10  Bitcoin’s daily percent price changes since the start of Mt. Gox
Data sourced from CoinDesk
One of the easiest ways to visualize the volatility of an
asset is to see how much its price changes day to day, or in
other words, the daily percent price changes. The bigger the
daily percent price changes are, the more volatile the asset is.
Figure 7.10 illustrates the daily percent price changes of
bitcoin from the time Mt. Gox opened to January 3, 2017.
The graph looks like what a seismometer would produce
when measuring ground movements during earthquakes. Early
in bitcoin’s history there were frequent earthquakes, with the
price moving more than 50 percent in a day. Over time,
however, the bitcoin seismometer has registered smaller and

smaller earthquakes in bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin has become
more popular and therefore more widely traded, so its market
has become more liquid. Therefore, when lots of people
choose to buy or sell, the market is able to absorb these
changes much more smoothly.
Even though bitcoin’s daily percent price changes have
decreased dramatically over the years—bringing it into the
range of many small capitalization growth stocks—it is still a
volatile asset. In Figure 7.11, compare the fluctuation of
bitcoin’s daily percent price changes in 2016 with that of
Twitter and a market stalwart like AT&T.
Figure 7.11 
 Bitcoin’s daily percent price changes versus Twitter and AT&T in
2016
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Twitter experienced three days in 2016 when its price
dropped more than 15 percent and one day where it jumped
more than 20 percent. Bitcoin had only two days where its
price increased more than 10 percent and only one day where

it dropped more than 15 percent. AT&T, the slow and steady
line in the middle, is a $250 billion company that lumbers
along with hardly any price movement.
Volatility is most commonly derived by taking the standard
deviation of the daily percent price changes. The bigger this
number is, the more the investor can expect significant swings
in the price of the asset they’re holding and therefore, the
riskier the asset is. Figure 7.12 shows the standard deviation of
the daily percent price changes of bitcoin, Twitter, and AT&T
in 2016.
Figure 7.12  Volatility of bitcoin, Twitter, and AT&T in 2016
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Twitter was 50 percent more volatile than bitcoin in 2016,
and bitcoin was nearly three times more volatile than AT&T.
The latter is to be expected given bitcoin’s network value is
less than 5 percent that of AT&T’s market cap, and it has been
around for less than a decade, while AT&T has been around

for more than a century.
In examining FANG stocks, we see an interesting pattern
with volatility. Remembering our discussion of modern
portfolio theory, historically the most volatile assets have
generally been the ones with the greatest returns. This
relationship between risk (i.e., volatility) and reward is to be
expected: no reward without the accompanying risk. In Figure
7.13 we see that bitcoin’s volatility has been the highest, with
Netflix coming in second; and these two assets were the best
performing. Interestingly, in this period bitcoin’s annual
returns of 212 percent were threefold that of Netflix’s 73
percent, yet bitcoin’s volatility was only 35 percent greater
than Netflix. Intuitively, it appears bitcoin has had better risk-
reward characteristics than Netflix. Similarly, Google, which
performed the least well of the FANG stocks with 23 percent
returns, also had the lowest volatility at 1.5 percent.
As we learned in the preceding chapter, it’s easy enough to
directly calculate the risk-reward ratio of different assets. It
would appear that in this time period (Facebook’s IPO to
January 3, 2017) bitcoin has had the best risk-reward ratio of
all these assets.
But to make sure, we’ll crunch the numbers.

Figure 7.13

SHARPE RATIO
Absolute returns and volatility are important in their own
right, but when they’re put together they yield the Sharpe
ratio, which is an equally important metric for investors to
consider. Remember that by dividing the absolute returns  by
the volatility, we can calibrate the returns for the risk taken.
The higher the Sharpe ratio, the more the asset is
compensating investors for the risk. This is an extremely
important metric in the context of modern portfolio theory,
because while an aggressive investor may salivate over sexy
returns, the innovative investor is equally aware of the risk
necessary to achieve those returns.
9

As discussed in the previous chapter, by combining returns
and volatility into one metric, we can do an apples-to-apples
comparison between cryptoassets and other traditional and
alternative assets. Currently, cryptoassets often have much
higher volatility than other assets, and the Sharpe ratio enables
us to understand this volatility in terms of the returns reaped.
It’s still important to consider volatility outside of the
Sharpe ratio in the context of the investor’s time horizon.
While some volatile assets will have excellent Sharpe ratios
over long time periods, those investments may not be
appropriate for someone needing to place a down payment on
a house three months from now.
In comparing bitcoin to the FANG stocks, we observed that
bitcoin had the highest volatility but also the highest returns by
far. Interestingly, its Sharpe ratio was not just the highest but
significantly so. Bitcoin compensated investors twice as well
for the risk they took than Facebook did and 40 percent better
than Netflix, its closest contender (see Figure 7.14).

Figure 7.14  Sharpe ratio of bitcoin and the FANG stocks since Facebook’s IPO
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Bitcoin and the FANG four’s Sharpe ratio comparison
clearly illustrates the importance of combining solid returns
and low volatility. While Facebook’s annual returns were just
shy of Amazon’s and better than Google’s, its volatility was
significantly greater than both. Therefore, since its IPO
Facebook has compensated investors least well for the risk
they’ve taken.
As we saw in Figure 7.11, “Bitcoin’s daily percent price
changes,” bitcoin’s daily swings have dampened significantly
over time, meaning its volatility is less. However,
simultaneous with decreasing volatility, bitcoin’s annual
appreciation has calmed as well. In Figure 7.15, we once again
see the relationship between risk and reward playing out as we
view bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio every full year from 2011 through
2016.

Figure 7.15  Bitcoin’s annual Sharpe ratios since the start of Mt. Gox
Data sourced from CoinDesk
The year 2014 was the only time bitcoin had a negative
Sharpe ratio, when it lost 60 percent of its value from the start
to the end of the year. Recall that 2014 was the year of
bitcoin’s painful decent from its late 2013 high to its early
2015 low, with Chinese regulations, Mt. Gox implosions, and
Silk Road associations plaguing the price of the asset.
Meanwhile, 2016 was bitcoin’s best risk-adjusted return year
since 2013. Digging into the comparison between 2013 and
2016, it’s remarkable that 2013’s Sharpe ratio was only double
that of 2016, even though bitcoin’s returns in 2013 were so
much greater, as shown in Figure 7.16.
Figure 7.16  Bitcoin’s annual appreciation
Data sourced from CoinDesk
With capital appreciation in 2013 at 45 times greater than
10

that of 2016, it would be reasonable to expect bitcoin in 2013
to have had a Sharpe ratio many times greater than in 2016.
However, this is where both daily volatility and the way the
Sharpe ratio is calculated come into play.  First, volatility in
2013 was triple that of 2016, which implies investors were
taking three times as much risk in 2013 as in 2016. This
allowed 2016 to have much lower returns but still have a risk-
reward ratio within the same ballpark as 2013. Second, the
Sharpe ratio is calculated using average weekly returns, not
total capital appreciation over the year.
The Sharpe ratio is also revealing when comparing bitcoin
to the broader market indices of the S&P 500, the DJIA, and
the NASDAQ 100. We already know these indices had lower
annual returns than bitcoin and the FANG stocks, but they also
had lower volatility given they were made up of diversified
baskets of stocks, and diversification helps reduce volatility.
Furthermore, these indices are made up of large market cap
names, especially the DJIA. As we saw with AT&T, many of
these large cap stocks have been around for a long time and
are relatively steady when compared with fast-moving tech
names. Figure 7.17 shows a comparison of bitcoin’s Sharpe
ratio to the aforementioned three broad market indices, using
the same period that we used for comparing the absolute
returns of these assets: July 19, 2010 through January 3, 2017.

Figure 7.17 
 Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio compared to major U.S. stock indices since
the start of Mt. Gox
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Once again, this chart reveals how absolute returns are
tempered by volatility when calculating the Sharpe ratio.
Although bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio is roughly 60 percent higher
than the three broad market indices, this is a far cry from its
absolute returns, which were roughly 20 times greater than the
broad market indices on an annual basis during the same
period.
In Figure 7.18 we compare bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio in 2016 to
that of the broad market indices. Because 2016 was bitcoin’s
lowest year of volatility (in the range of a small-to mid-cap
stock), it is the most appropriate period to compare it to
equities. What’s most surprising is bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio in
2016 was almost as high as its overall Sharpe ratio since the
launch of Mt. Gox, the first exchange that gave mainstream
investors access to bitcoin (1.65 for 2016 vs. 1.66 since Mt.
Gox).

Figure 7.18  Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio compared to major U.S. stock indices in 2016
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
Some people are apt to think that the best years to be a
bitcoin investor are past. However, looking at the Sharpe
Ratio, 2016 had risk-adjusted returns that were as good as
those of an investor who bought bitcoin when the mainstream
first had the opportunity to do so.
CORRELATION
Diversification is accomplished by selecting a variety of assets
that have low to negative correlation with one another. A
group of stocks is inherently more diversified than a single
stock, and therefore the volatility should be lower.
Cryptoassets have near-zero correlation to other capital
market assets. The best explanation for this is that cryptoassets
are so new that many capital market investors don’t play in the
same asset pools. Therefore, cryptoassets aren’t dancing to the

same rhythm of information as traditional capital market
assets, at least not yet.
Figure 7.19 
 The correlation coefficient and effects of diversification on risk
Source: A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Burton G. Malkiel, 2015
Figure 7.19 clearly shows that if an asset is zero correlated
to other assets in a portfolio, then “considerable risk reduction
is possible.” In quantitative terms, reducing risk can be seen
by a decrease in the volatility of the portfolio.
If an asset merely reduces the risk of the overall portfolio
by being lowly to negatively correlated with other assets, then
it doesn’t have to provide superior absolute returns to improve
the risk-reward ratio of the overall portfolio. Since the Sharpe
ratio is returns divided by risk, if the risk gets smaller, then the
denominator gets smaller, making the Sharpe ratio bigger. The
returns don’t have to change at all.
However, it is possible for an asset to be added to a
portfolio that both decreases the risk of the portfolio and
increases the returns. Finding assets that can do this is rare and
almost feels like cheating the laws of risk-reward. After all,
we’ve already learned that the more rewarding an asset is, the
riskier it likely is. But with a portfolio we are not talking about
a single asset but rather a group of them. It is the way in which

a new asset behaves with the preexisting group of assets in a
portfolio that is the key to both reducing risk and increasing
returns.
CRYPTOASSETS AS THE SILVER
BULLET OF DIVERSIFICATION
Most people would reasonably expect that if they added
bitcoin to their portfolio it would increase the absolute returns
but it would also make the portfolio significantly riskier (more
volatile). However, it’s important to remember that bitcoin’s
propensity toward volatility proved true early in its life when
volume was low (thin). In contrast, the past few years have
been more nuanced: bitcoin’s volatility has calmed, yet it
retains a low correlation with other assets. In some years,
bitcoin even provided the magical and elusive combination
mentioned above of increasing the returns while also
decreasing risk within a portfolio.
The question is how bitcoin’s low to negative correlation
with other capital market assets would have affected the
volatility of a portfolio in which it was included. To perform
our analysis, let’s use the definition of a moderate investor laid
forth by the American Association of Individual Investors
(AAII).  Per the AAII, a moderate investor allocates 70
percent to stocks and 30 percent to bonds, a common asset
allocation model. The innovative investor can also be
moderate and diversify beyond stocks and bonds into
alternative assets, such as bitcoin. Innovative yet moderate
investors interested in bitcoin could do so by taking a small
piece of their equity portfolio, say 1 percent, and purchasing
13

bitcoin. In this way, they maintain their overall risk profile
because equities are riskier than bonds, and so swapping one
risky asset with another risky asset is a reasonable adjustment.
We built a model to simulate how a 70 percent equities–30
percent bonds portfolio would have behaved in comparison to
a 1 percent bitcoin–69 percent equities–30 percent bonds
portfolio. For equities, we used the S&P 500 index, and for
bonds we used a broad-based U.S. bonds index known as the
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
We calculated using quarterly rebalancing to maintain the
original percentage target. As assets rise and fall, over time
their percentages in a portfolio change. It’s common practice
to reassess each quarter and make small buy and sell
transactions to reset the target percentages. For example, an
investor that purchased a 1 percent position in bitcoin four
years ago would have had a whopping 32 percent allocation by
the start of 2017, as shown in Figure 7.20. The difference
between a 1 percent and 32 percent portfolio allocation creates
a drastically different risk profile and would likely not be
appropriate for all. Hence the importance of rebalancing.

Figure 7.20 
 The effects of rebalancing versus not rebalancing a portfolio
Data sourced from Bloomberg and CoinDesk
What if the innovative investor had deployed 1 percent of
his or her equity capital into bitcoin at the start of 2013, peak
of 2013, and start of 2015, done quarterly rebalancing, and
held until our designated end date of January 3, 2017?
Interestingly, while a 1 percent investment in any asset might
seem insignificant, when done in bitcoin the results were
definitive.
At the start of 2013, bitcoin was around $10 a coin and still
had a tumultuous 2013 and 2014 in front of it. As a result, it’s
not surprising that there was an increase in both the absolute
returns of the portfolio and the volatility. As can be seen in
Figure 7.21, compound annual returns proved superior with a
1 percent allocation to bitcoin and volatility was 4 percent
higher. In this case the volatility was worth it, because the
bitcoin portfolio had a 22 percent greater Sharpe Ratio,
offering more return for the risk taken (note that comparison

calculations in the text were made using unrounded numbers,
while the tables show rounded numbers).

1 percent allocation of bitcoin

To underscore the significance of compound annual returns
3.2 percent greater over a four-year period, we look at the end
results. If both portfolios started at $100,000, the
outperforming bitcoin portfolio would have accumulated
approximately $170,000, while the one without bitcoin
reached only about $150,000, a difference of $20,000 over
four years.
Now comes the true test of bitcoin: if an investor had
decided to deploy a 1 percent allocation into bitcoin at its
November 29, 2013 peak and held it until the start of 2017,
what would have happened? It would be reasonable to expect
that even a 1 percent allocation to bitcoin would put a drag on
the returns of the portfolio and also lower the Sharpe ratio.
However, here is where the power of rebalancing and dollar
cost averaging would have come into play. An investor would
have endured one year of sliding prices (2014) before then
enjoying two years of rising prices (2015 and 2016). By

rebalancing quarterly, the investor would have been gradually
adding to the bitcoin portion of the portfolio to make up for
the continually lower percentage due to its falling price. In
effect, the investor would have been dollar cost averaging
down. As a result, the compound annual returns of this period
are about equal for the two portfolios. More surprisingly, the
portfolio with bitcoin would have had lower volatility! The
power of diversification is becoming evident, and it leads to a
marginally superior Sharpe ratio for the investor who held
bitcoin as a 1 percent position in his or her portfolio during
this period (see Figure 7.22).

and without a 1 percent allocation of bitcoin

However, it is the two-year period between 2015 and 2017
that really shines. Shown in Figure 7.23, the portfolio with a 1
percent allocation of bitcoin would have been less volatile,
while improving compound annual returns by 0.6 percent,
ultimately yielding a Sharpe ratio 14 percent better. Operating
in the wild, innovative investors would have experienced the
joy of a golden asset that both decreased volatility and
increased returns when added to their portfolio, providing a

double boost to the Sharpe ratio.

In the previous chapter, we explored the necessary use of
tools such as modern portfolio theory and asset allocation to
build an effective investment portfolio and to identify
appropriate and compelling investment options for the
innovative investor. In this chapter, we’ve looked through the
lens of modern portfolio theory at bitcoin as an investment
over time. The next chapters will address the broad
characteristics of bitcoin and its digital siblings as an entirely
new asset class with which the capital markets must reckon.

Chapter 8
Defining Cryptoassets as a
New Asset Class
hus far, we’ve covered the birth of Bitcoin, the rise of
blockchain as a general purpose technology, a brief history of
cryptoassets at large, the keys to portfolio management, and
how bitcoin would have performed in the context of modern
portfolio theory over its first eight years of life. What the
innovative investor now needs is a framework to understand
the general patterns to be expected of all cryptoassets going
forward. To set the foundation for that framework, we need to
first define what type of asset a cryptoasset is.
Are bitcoin and its digital siblings to be defined as
commodities, as the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission seems to believe?  Or are they better thought of
as property, as the Internal Revenue Service has set forth?
The Securities and Exchange Commission has thus far steered
clear of applying a specific label to all cryptoassets, though in
late July 2017 it did release a report detailing how some
cryptoassets can be classified as securities, with the most
notable example being The DAO.

While it’s a great validation of cryptoassets that regulators
are working to provide clarity on how to classify at least some
of them, most of the existing laws set forth suffer from the
same flaw: agencies are interpreting cryptoassets through the
lens of the past.
What further complicates the situation is that not all
cryptoassets are made equal. Just as there is diversity in
equities, with analysts segmenting companies depending on
their market capitalization, sector, or geography, so too is
there diversity in cryptoassets. Bitcoin, litecoin, monero, dash,
and zcash fulfill the three definitions of a currency: serving as
a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.
However, as we’ve seen, many other cryptoassets function as
digital commodities, or cryptocommodities. These
cryptocommodities include ether, storj, sia, and golem.
Meanwhile, there are myriad cryptotokens for end-user-
specific applications, such as augur, steem, singularDTV, or
gamecredits. Moreover, all cryptoassets are alive with code
that morphs based on the evolution of use cases and the value-
add that the core open-source developers feel their cryptoasset
can best fulfill.
How can a regulator possibly hope to put a cryptoasset in a
category that is centuries old, when these assets are redefining
themselves and breaking their own boundaries every couple of
years, if not every couple of months?
They can’t.
The point is not to bash regulators but to show how hard it
is to classify a brand-new asset class, especially when it is the
first digital native asset class the world has seen.

WHAT IS AN ASSET CLASS, ANYWAY?
While people accept that equities and bonds are the two major
investment asset classes, and others will accept that money
market funds, real estate, precious metals, and currencies are
other commonly used asset classes,  few bother to understand
what is meant by an asset class in the first place.
Robert Greer, vice president of Daiwa Securities, wrote
“What Is an Asset Class, Anyway?”  a seminal paper on the
definition of an asset class in a 1997 issue of The Journal of
Portfolio Management. According to Greer:
An asset class is a set of assets that bear some fundamental economic
similarities to each other, and that have characteristics that make them
distinct from other assets that are not part of that class.
Still fuzzy. Greer then goes on to define three superclasses of
assets:
•   Capital assets
•   Consumable/transformable assets
•   Store of value assets
Greer has the following to say about how to identify each
superclass from the others (boldface ours):
Capital Assets
One thing all these capital assets have in common. A capital asset might
reasonably be valued on the basis of the net present value of its
expected returns. Therefore, everything else being equal (which it never
really is), a financial capital asset (such as a stock or a bond) will decline in
value as the investor’s discount rate increases, or rise as that rate decreases.
This economic characteristic unifies the superclass of capital assets.
Consumable/Transformable (C/T) Assets
4
5

You can consume it. You can transform it into another asset. It has
economic value. But it does not yield an ongoing stream of value… . The
profound implication of this distinction is that C/T assets, not being capital
in nature, cannot be valued using net present value analysis. This makes
them truly economically distinct from the superclass of capital assets. C/T
assets must be valued more often on the basis of the particular supply
and demand characteristics of their specific market.
Store of Value Assets
The third superclass of asset cannot be consumed; nor can it generate
income. Nevertheless, it has value; it is a store of value asset. One example
is fine art… . A broader and more relevant example is the category of
currency, either foreign or domestic … store of value assets, can serve as a
refuge during uncertainty (U.S. Cash), or offer currency diversification to
the portfolio. [Author note: He does not define how to price it.]
Greer’s superclasses are not clear-cut, as some assets can
fall into two camps. For example, precious metals are both
C/T assets and store of value assets. They are used in the
circuitry of electronics or transformed into ornate forms of
decoration (C/T asset), and they are also held solely as bars of
value, not meant for consumption or transformation of any
kind (store of value asset).
Cryptoassets most obviously fall into the C/T realm
because they have utility and are consumed digitally. For
example, developers use ether to gain access to Ethereum’s
world computer, which then can perform operations on smart
contracts stored in Ethereum’s blockchain. Hence, ether is
consumed in the operation of a world computer. Then there is
“attention,” the fuel of advertising, which is leading to the
creation of blockchain-based attention markets. Steemit is a
social media platform with the native cryptoasset steem that
rewards content creators and curators. Steem creates an
economic system that rewards creators for new, quality

content because that content enhances the platform, thereby
increasing the value of steem.
While many cryptoassets are priced by the dynamics of
supply and demand in markets, similar to more traditional C/T
assets, for some holders of bitcoin—like holders of gold bars
—it is solely a store of value. Other investors use cryptoassets
beyond bitcoin in a similar way, holding the asset in the hope
that it appreciates over time. Therefore, one could make the
case that cryptoassets are like precious metals in that they
belong to two superclasses of assets.
According to Greer, beneath these superclasses, there are
classes. And within the classes, there are subclasses. These
classifications can help innovative investors understand the
different ways in which their investments relate to one
another, and enable them to best diversify their portfolios.
For example, within the superclass of capital assets there is
the class of equities, and within the class of equities there are
subclasses like large-cap value or small-cap growth.
Cryptoassets are a class that falls between the C/T and store of
value superclasses. Within the cryptoassets class there are the
subclasses of cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, and
cryptotokens.
ETFS AND MUTUAL FUNDS ARE WRAPPERS, NOT ASSET
CLASSES
It should be noted that when we talk about asset classes we
are not doing so in the context of the investment vehicle
that may “house” the underlying asset, whether that
vehicle is a mutual fund, ETF, or separately managed
account. With the growth of financial engineering and

securitization of nearly every asset—and especially with
the growing popularity of ETFs—one may find every type
of asset at some point housed within an ETF. For example,
ETFs for bitcoin and ether are already in the filing process
with the SEC. For the purpose of our definition of asset
classes, we are distinguishing the asset class from the form
within which they are traded.
Delineating the separation between asset classes is no easy
task. Greer gives us one solid point to distinguish assets, the
economic similarities, but then leaves the rest to
“characteristics that make them distinct.” We’ve reviewed the
academic literature further in order to crystallize the difference
between asset classes. Much of the thinking in this chapter
grew out of a collaboration between ARK Invest and Coinbase
through late 2015 and into 2016 when the two firms first made
the claim that bitcoin was ringing the bell for a new asset
class.
KEY DIFFERENTIATORS BETWEEN
ASSET CLASSES
In our investigation of economic characteristics, we find the
main differences come down to governance, supply schedule,
use cases, and basis of value. Beyond economic similarities,
asset classes also tend to have similar liquidity and trading
volume profiles. Remember that a liquidity profile refers to
how deep the order book of the markets is, while trading
volume refers to how much is traded daily. Lastly, asset
classes differ in their marketplace behavior, the most
6

important of which include risk, reward, and correlation with
other assets.
A general pattern exists of assets belonging in the same
class behaving in a similar fashion. While each unique asset in
a class will behave slightly differently from others, they
resemble one another more closely than they resemble assets
from other classes.
Brand-new assets within a class will differ in their behavior
from more mature assets in the same class. Differences in
maturity are particularly relevant for cryptoassets, with its
oldest asset being only eight years old and newborns arriving
on a weekly cadence.
At the moment, cryptoassets are best described as an
emerging class. Their economic characteristics of governance,
supply schedule, use cases, and basis of value are relatively
fixed from the genesis of any particular cryptoasset. What will
change more over time are the liquidity profile and
marketplace characteristics as these assets mature. The
remainder of this chapter will focus on the economic
characteristics of cryptoassets, while the next chapter will dive
into the progression of liquidity profiles and marketplace
characteristics of different cryptoassets over time, and how
those trends compare with other assets.
ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF AN
ASSET CLASS
For the innovative investor, evaluating cryptoassets requires
similar analysis as other assets. The starting point is to
recognize and identify those economic characteristics that

qualify them as their own asset class. We believe that this can
be done by evaluating them on the basis of four criteria.
How Are They Governed?
Just as countries are governed, so too are assets. Typically,
there are three layers of governance for assets of all kinds: the
procurers of the asset, the people holding the asset, and a
regulatory body or multiple regulatory bodies to oversee the
behavior of the procurers and the holders.
For example, a typical equity has the management of the
underlying company, the shareholders of the company, and the
SEC as a regulatory overseer.
Energy commodities and their associated derivatives, such
as oil and natural gas, are arguably more complex. The
governance of the procurers is often much more dispersed and
global in nature, as are the holders of the physical
commodities. For the financial derivatives of these
commodities, in the U.S. the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) provides a layer of regulatory
cohesiveness, while the SEC plays the same role for ETFs,
mutual funds, and other fund structures that are composed of
these assets.
Currency, a somewhat more controversial asset class, also
has a unique governance profile. First, a central bank controls
its distribution, while the people of the country, global
businesses, and international creditors often dictate the
exchange rate and use of the currency (though a controlling
nation can manipulate these arenas). Regulatory bodies vary
by nation, and there are international regulatory bodies like the
International Monetary Fund if the currency of a nation hits

choppy water.
Cryptoassets adhere to a twenty-first century model of
governance unique from all other asset classes and largely
inspired by the open source software movement. The procurers
of the asset and associated use cases are three pronged. First, a
group of talented software developers decide to create the
blockchain protocol or distributed application that utilizes a
native asset. These developers adhere to an open contributor
model, which means that over time any new developer can
earn his or her way onto the development team through merit.
However, the developers are not the only ones in charge of
procuring a cryptoasset; they only provide the code. The
people who own and maintain the computers that run the code
—the miners—also have a say in the development of the code
because they have to download new software updates. The
developers can’t force miners to update software. Instead, they
must convince them that it makes sense for the health of the
overall blockchain, and the economic health of the miner, to
do so.
In addition to the developers and miners, there is a third
level of governance among the procurers: the companies that
offer services that interface between the cryptoasset and the
broader public. These companies often employ some of the
core developers, but even if they don’t, they can assert
significant influence over the system if they are a large force
behind user adoption.
After the three groups of procurers, there are the holders or
the end users who buy the cryptoasset for investment purposes
or to gain access to the utility of the underlying blockchain
architecture. These users are constantly providing feedback to
7

the developers, miners, and companies, in whose interest it is
to listen, because if users stop using the cryptoasset, then
demand will go down and so too will the price. Therefore, the
procurers are constantly held accountable by the users.
Last, there is an emerging regulatory landscape for
cryptoassets. However, regulators are still considering exactly
how they want to handle this emerging asset class.
What Is the Supply Schedule?
The supply schedule of an asset can be influenced by its three
layers of governance, but the procurers typically have the
strongest hand. For example, with equities there is an initial
share issuance via an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO
helps the management of the underlying company raise cash
from the capital markets and get broader exposure for their
company’s brand. The company can continue to issue shares,
via stock-based compensation or secondary offerings, but if
they do so at too high a quantity, their investors may rebel
because their ownership of the company is becoming diluted.
Bonds, on the other hand, are markedly different from
equities. Once a company, government, or other entity issues a
bond, that is a claim upon a fixed amount of debt. There is no
negotiating on that debt except in the case of default. That
same entity may issue more bonds going forward, but unless
that issuance is an indicator of economic distress, typically a
follow-on issuance of bonds will have little effect on a prior
set of issued bonds.
Depending on the energy commodity, there can be varied
supply schedules, though nearly all of them are calibrated to
balance market supply and demand and to avoid supply gluts

that hurt all procurers. For example, with oil, there’s the
famous Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which has had considerable control over the supply
levels of oil.
The central banks that control currency supply have even
more control than OPEC. As the world has witnessed since the
financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, a central bank can choose to
issue as much currency in the form of quantitative easing as it
wants. It does this most often through open market operations,
such as buying back government issued bonds and other assets
to inject cash into the economy. Central bank activity can lead
to drastic increases in the supply of a fiat currency, as we have
seen in the U.S. dollar. Figure 8.1 shows a comparison of the
supply schedules of bitcoin, the U.S. dollar, and gold.8


Figure 8.1 
 Comparison of supply schedules of bitcoin, the U.S. dollar, and gold
Precious metals have long been valued for their scarcity
and aesthetic appeal, even though, as metals, most are largely
inferior to other more common metals. Their malleability
makes them impossible to use for structural support as they
can easily be deformed. However, due to their scarcity and
now near universal acceptance as a form of beauty, they have
come to be considered a relatively safe store of value. Notice
also, Figure 8.1 reveals that gold’s supply is on an inflationary
schedule. In other words, each year more gold is pulled out of
the ground than the year before, much to the surprise of many
gold bugs.
Cryptoassets, like gold, are often constructed to be scarce in
their supply. Many will be even more scarce than gold and
other precious metals. The supply schedule of cryptoassets
typically is metered mathematically and set in code at the
genesis of the underlying protocol or distributed application.
Bitcoin provides for a maximum of 21 million units by
2140, and it gets there by cutting the rate of supply inflation
every four years. Currently, the supply schedule is at 4 percent
annually, in 2020 that will be cut to 2 percent annually, and in
2024 it will drop to 1 percent annually. As discussed earlier,
Satoshi crafted the system this way because he needed initially
to bootstrap support for Bitcoin, which he did by issuing large
amounts of the coin for the earliest contributors. As Bitcoin
matured, the value of its native asset appreciated, which means
less bitcoin had to be issued to continue to motivate people to
contribute. Now that Bitcoin is over eight years old, it
provides strong utility to the world beyond as an investment,
which drives demand. Over time, next to zero bitcoin will be

issued, but the aim is for the network to be so big by then that
all contributors get paid a sufficient amount via transaction
fees, just like Visa or MasterCard.
Many other cryptoassets follow a similar model of
mathematical issuance, though they differ widely in the exact
rates. For example, Ethereum initially planned to issue 18
million ether each year in perpetuity. The thinking was that as
the underlying base of ether grew, these 18 million units
would become an increasingly small percentage of the
monetary base. As a result, the rate of supply inflation would
ultimately converge on 0 percent. The Ethereum team is
currently rethinking that issuance strategy due to an intended
change in its consensus mechanism. Choosing to change the
issuance schedule of a cryptoasset from the plan at time of
launch is more the exception than the norm, though since the
asset class is still young we are not surprised by such
experimentation.
Steemit’s team pursued a far more complicated monetary
policy with its platform, composed of steem (STEEM), steem
power (SP), and steem dollars (SMD). The founding team
initially chose STEEM to increase in supply by 100 percent
per year. While they incorporated a wrinkle that would
decrease the total units outstanding by periodically dividing it
to combat outrageously large numbers, they quickly
discovered that even this modification would not be enough to
avoid an unsustainably high rate of inflation and devaluation
of the platform. They have also chosen to modify their
monetary policy post-inception.
Steemit is an example of why innovative investors should
investigate the monetary policy of a platform to make sure it

makes economic sense and avoid being caught in a situation
similar to the STEEM bubble that we will detail in Chapter 10.
As each individual cryptoasset matures, we expect the
monetary policy to ossify into its mathematically metered
intent.
How Are They Used?
Governance and supply schedules play an important role in the
use cases of an asset. For equities and bonds, the use cases are
straightforward. Equities allow a company to raise capital
from the capital markets via issuance of shares, while bonds
allow a company to raise capital via the issuance of debt.
Currencies are clear-cut in their use cases as well, serving as a
means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.
Commodities are where use cases can become more
diverse. The use cases for metals or semiconducting agents
changes as technology progresses. For example, silicon was
once a forgotten element, but with the age of semiconductors it
has become vital, causing arguably the most innovative valley
in the world to be named after it (though there is no physical
silicon to be taken from the ground there).
Cryptoassets can be likened to silicon. They have come
upon the scene due to the rise of technology, and their use
cases will grow and change as technology evolves. Currently,
bitcoin is the most straightforward, with its use case being that
of a decentralized global currency. Ether is more flexible, as
developers use it for computational gas within a decentralized
world computer. Augur facilitates prediction markets on a
decentralized system, economically compensating (or
punishing) individuals for telling the truth (or lies).

Then there are the trading markets, which trade 24/7, 365
days a year. These global and eternally open markets also
differentiate cryptoassets from the other assets discussed
herein.
In short, the use cases for cryptoassets are more dynamic
than any preexisting asset class. Furthermore, since they’re
brought into the world and then controlled by open-source
software, the ability for cryptoassets to evolve is unbounded.
What Is the Basis of Value?
As Greer mentioned in his definition of superclasses, capital
assets like equities and bonds are valued based on the net
present value (NPV) of all future cash flows. With net present
value, Greer refers to the idea that a dollar tomorrow is worth
less than a dollar today. For example, if an investor puts $100
in a savings account and earns a 5 percent annual return (in the
good old days), then one year from now that $100 will be
worth $105. Therefore, investors either want the $100 today,
or the $105 a year from now, but they don’t want the $100 a
year from now or they’ve effectively lost money.
C/T assets are priced by market dynamics of supply and
demand, as are the more liquid store of value assets like
currencies. However, it should be noted with currencies that
the governance of the issuing nation can meddle with the
exchange rate, and therefore basis of value, of the currency.
Value assets like fine art are the hardest and most subjective to
value, as often beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Cryptoassets have two drivers of their basis of value: utility
and speculative.
Digital units of bitcoin don’t exist beyond unspent

transaction outputs—or credits—in bitcoin’s blockchain.
Therefore, a significant portion of the basis of value is what
the underlying blockchain enables the users of the assets to do;
in other words, bitcoin’s utility value.
Utility value refers to what the underlying blockchain is
used for, and therefore what the demand is for its asset. For
example, Bitcoin’s blockchain is used to transact bitcoin and
therefore much of the value is driven by demand to use bitcoin
as a means of exchange. Similarly, bitcoin can be used as a
store of value, so a percentage of the bitcoin outstanding is
demanded for that use case. All these use cases temporarily
bind bitcoin, drawing it out of the supply of bitcoin
outstanding. The more that people want to use bitcoin, the
more they’ll have to pay to get access to it.
On top of utility value, there’s a speculative value to a
cryptoasset. Since cryptoassets are all under a decade old,
much is still left to be seen regarding how each will develop,
which is where speculative value comes into play.
Speculative value is driven by people trying to predict how
widely used a particular cryptoasset will be in the future. It’s
similar to newly publicly traded companies, where much of
the market capitalization of the company is based on what
investors expect from it in the future. As a result, the multiple
of sales at which the company is valued is much greater than
the multiple of sales that a more mature company will trade at.
For example, a young, fast-growing company with $100
million in revenue may be worth $1 billion, whereas a much
older company that is hardly growing may have $500 million
in sales and also be worth $1 billion. With these two
companies, the younger one has greater investor speculation

about the future cash flow of the company baked into what it’s
worth, while with the older company, investors are valuing it
much more closely to its current revenue situation because
they know more or less what they’ll be getting going forward.
With cryptoassets, much of the speculative value can be
derived from the development team. People will have more
faith that a cryptoasset will be widely adopted if it is crafted
by a talented and focused development team. Furthermore, if
the development team has a grand vision for the widespread
use of the cryptoasset, then that can increase the speculative
value of the asset.
As each cryptoasset matures, it will converge on its utility
value. Right now, bitcoin is the furthest along the transition
from speculative price support to utility price support because
it has been around the longest and people are using it regularly
for its intended utility use cases. For example, in 2016,
$100,000 of bitcoin was transacted every minute, which
creates real demand for the utility of the asset beyond its
trading demand. A great illustration of bitcoin’s price support
increasingly being tied to utility came from Pantera Capital, a
well-respected investment firm solely focused on cryptoassets
and technology. In Figure 8.2 we can see that in November
2013 bitcoin’s speculative value skyrocketed beyond its utility
value, which is represented here by transactions per day using
Bitcoin’s blockchain (CAGR is the compound annual growth
rate).

Figure 8.2  Comparison of bitcoin’s price with its utility value
Source: https://medium.com/@PanteraCapital/bitcoin-continues-exponential-
growth-in-2016-blockchain-letter-february-2017-9445c7d9e5a2
Speculative value diminishes as a cryptoasset matures
because there is less speculation regarding the future markets
the cryptoasset will penetrate. This means people will
understand more clearly what demand for the asset will look
like going forward. The younger the cryptoasset is, the more
its value will be driven by speculative value, as shown in
Figure 8.3. While we expect cryptoassets to ossify into their
primary use cases over time, especially as they become large
systems that support significant amounts of value, their open-
source nature leaves open the possibility that they will be
tweaked to pursue new tangential use cases, which could once
again add speculative value to the asset.

Figure 8.3  The maturation of a cryptoasset from speculative to utility value
Speculative value in young markets is hard to estimate and
can be dangerous to play with, as often only a few investors
have a good basis for the future value of the asset, while the
rest follow the movement of the market.
Benjamin Graham uses a famous example in his classic
investing book The Intelligent Investor, where he personifies
the market as Mr. Market, who is prone to oscillation between
dark and ebullient moods. When Mr. Market is dark, he’ll
throw assets around, damaging their value to beneath their
utility value. When Mr. Market is ebullient, he’ll pay most any
price for assets, driving them far above their utility value with
hefty speculative premiums. Mr. Market is a fictional
representation of the movement of crowds, and Graham
suggests that investors do their fundamental work on the asset

and from there ignore the moods of Mr. Market. Speaking of
Mr. Market, let’s discuss how cryptoasset marketplace
behavior evolves over time.

I
Chapter 9
The Evolution of Cryptoasset
Market Behavior
n the previous chapter, we discussed what differentiated asset
classes from one another. We identified economic
characteristics, liquidity and trading volume profiles, and
marketplace behavior, as key differentiators. The economic
characteristics covered in Chapter 8 are largely well defined at
the launch of an asset, though any given cryptoasset’s
economic characteristics may evolve more than a stock, and
certainly more than a bond, given the nature of its open-source
software.
Inarguably, the liquidity and trading volume profiles along
with the marketplace behavior of an asset class—and
individual examples within an asset class—mature
considerably over time. For example, in 1602 when the United
Dutch Chartered East India Company (Dutch East India
Company, for short) became the first company to issue stock,
the shares were extremely illiquid. When first issued, no stock
market even existed, and purchasers were expected to hold on
to the shares for 21 years, the length of time granted to the
1

company by the Netherlands’ charter over trade in Asia.
However, some investors wanted to sell their shares, perhaps
to pay down debts, and so an informal market for the stock
(the very first stock market) developed in the Amsterdam East
India House. As more joint-stock equity companies were
founded, this informal location grew, and was later formalized
as the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the oldest “modern”
securities exchange in the world.  Despite the structure of the
shares of the Dutch East India Company not changing much,
their market liquidity and trading volumes changed
considerably.
Similarly, when bitcoin, the first cryptoasset and therefore
the crypto-analogue to the Dutch East India Company, was
“issued” through the mining process, there was no market to
transact or trade bitcoin. For much of 2009, there were hardly
any bitcoin transactions, even though a new batch of 50
bitcoin was minted every 10 minutes. It wasn’t until October
2009 that the first recorded transaction of bitcoin for the U.S.
dollar took place: 5,050 bitcoin for $5.02, paid via PayPal.
This transaction was sent from one of Bitcoin’s earliest
proselytizers, Martti Malmi, to an individual using the name
NewLibertyStandard, who was trying to set up the world’s
first consistent place of exchange between bitcoin and the U.S.
dollar.
To say it was an exchange in the sense of the word that we
think of today would be an overstatement.
NewLibertyStandard’s attempt to create a trading location for
bitcoin was sparsely populated and illiquid, yet the idea was
there. It wouldn’t be until the summer of 2010 that a
formidable place of exchange would come into existence. In
2

short, the bitcoin markets took time to develop, just as those
for stocks or any other asset class.
The asset can stay the same, but the functioning markets
around it and the way the asset changes hands can morph
considerably. For example, currently the bond markets are
undergoing significant changes, as a surprising amount of
bond trading is still a “voice and paper market,” where trades
are made by institutions calling one another and tangible paper
is processed. This makes the bond market much more illiquid
and opaque than the stock market, where most transactions are
done almost entirely electronically. With the growing wave of
digitalization, the bond markets are becoming increasingly
liquid and transparent. The same can be said of markets for
commodities, art, fine wine, and so on.
Cryptoassets have an inherent advantage in their liquidity
and trading volume profile, because they are digital natives.
As digital natives, cryptoassets have no physical form, and can
be moved as quickly as the Internet can move the 1s and 0s
that convey ownership. The rapidity with which cryptoassets
can be moved sets them apart from other asset classes—
especially alternative assets like art, real estate, and fine wines
—and should enable more liquid markets much earlier in their
developmental history.
Correlations between assets are also relevant in the
evolution of an asset class. Recall from Chapter 6 that
correlation refers to the prices of assets moving together. With
the globalization of markets, correlations have largely
increased as national economies are attached at the hip. Many
still turn to gold in risk-off periods, when they want something
safe from the groupthink trading in the bond and equity

markets.
As of April 2017, the aggregate network value for
cryptoassets was so small on a relative basis, storing less than
$30 billion in value, that they had yet to penetrate most
traditional investor capital pools. Even though they are
growing at an incredible clip, separation between cryptoasset
markets and traditional investor capital pools still largely
remains the case. As a result, cryptoassets currently have little
correlation with traditional assets. However, we increasingly
see signs of correlation between bitcoin and the broader capital
markets (either negative or positive correlation), which makes
sense as bitcoin is the most well-established cryptoasset and
will likely be the first for traditional investors to venture into.
Over time, we expect increasing correlations (once again,
either negative or positive) between cryptoassets and other
asset classes, as overlap between the entities using these
investments increases. The transition from an emerging asset
class to a mature asset class involves being accepted by the
broader capital markets.
It’s critical for the innovative investor to understand the
liquidity and trading volume profiles of cryptoassets and how
they change as they mature. Given bitcoin’s status and tenure,
we’ll begin there. Then for comparison, we’ll pull in relevant
examples from other top cryptoassets by market cap, such as
ether, dash, ripple, monero, and litecoin.
BITCOIN’S LIQUIDITY AND TRADING
VOLUME PROFILE
Bitcoin’s liquidity has improved dramatically over time, and

exchanges have grown from just Mt. Gox in July 2010 to over
40 as of the start of 2017.  Equally, the order books of
individual exchanges have matured. For example, consider
that on the first day Mt. Gox traded bitcoin, only 20 were
traded, totaling 99 cents of value. On opening day Mt. Gox
had an extremely thin order book. Now sites such as
Bitcoinity.org provide metrics like, “Spread 100 BTC [%],”
showing how much the price of bitcoin would move on
different exchanges if 100 bitcoin were bought.
In Figure 9.1, we see that there are five exchanges where
placing a trade for 100 bitcoin (at the time, worth about
$100,000) would not move the price more than 1 percent—and
this was only for U.S. dollar-denominated order books. As can
be seen in the upper-right tab, one can compare order books
for different currency pairs, like the yuan, yen, euro, and so
on.

Greater liquidity is created from more trading activity, as
there are more people buying and selling bitcoin. Global
trading volumes since the opening of Mt. Gox have increased
exponentially.  On January 5, 2017, bitcoin trading activity
clocked in at over $11 billion and bitcoin broke through
$1,000 a coin for the second time in its history (see Figure
9.2).
Figure 9.2 
 Bitcoin’s trading volume history
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
Just as trading equities evolved from an informal venue in
Amsterdam to trading hundreds of billions of dollars daily in
exchanges all over the world, so too has bitcoin evolved. We
now have tens of exchanges globally trading hundreds of
millions to billions of dollars daily. This increase in trading
volume is a function of increased interest, which has driven
maturation in bitcoin markets.

THE EVOLUTION OF CRYPTOASSET
TRADING VOLUMES
Other cryptoassets show similar trends as they mature, but
because they’re younger than bitcoin, their variability in
volume and liquidity is greater. For example, in 2016, Monero
experienced a sizeable increase in notoriety—largely because
its privacy features began to be utilized by a well-known dark
market —which sent its average trading volume skyrocketing.
In December 2015, daily volume for the asset was $27,300,
but by December 2016 it was $3.25M, well over a hundredfold
increase. The price of the asset had appreciated more than 20-
fold in the same period, so some of the increase in trading
volume was due to price appreciation, but clearly a large
amount was due to increased interest and trading activity in
the asset. Figure 9.3 shows monero’s historic trading volume.
8

Figure 9.3 
 Monero’s trading volume history
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
To varying degrees, ether, dash, litecoin, ripple, and other
cryptoassets have shown similar increases in trading volume
as they have matured. Many cryptoassets will enjoy significant
boosts in trading volumes upon sizeable price appreciation
because a rising asset catches the attention of more investors
and traders. Such a pattern is easily visible in monero in
Figure 9.3. However, once the cryptoasset settles down into a
price range, its trading volume will often settle into a new
range as well. Some cryptoasset traders will then look for
increases in volume as an early indicator that interest is
picking up and that a move in the asset’s price could be on the
horizon.
Regardless of whether or not traders are right, burgeoning
interest, trading volumes, and market liquidity all point to a
maturing cryptoasset. If sustained, all of these are good
indicators of health for the innovative investor to be aware of.
If, however, the rise in trading volumes looks too steep and
there is little news as to why, then that is reason to be wary. As
we will cover in the next two chapters on speculation,
sometimes volumes that rise too far and too fast can be a sign
of manipulation or overheating markets.
REGULATORY IMPACT ON MARKET
LIQUIDITY
While the innovative investor can generally expect assets with
real value to mature and increase in liquidity and trading over
time, external factors that impact markets can significantly

dampen trading volume. Investors become skittish and at times
regulation can forcibly clamp down on overenthusiasm. What
helps an asset through these difficult periods is the diversity
and depth of the exchanges and trading pairs offered globally.
On January 6, 2017, the day after bitcoin hit an all-time
high trading volume of $11 billion in one day and crossed the
$1000-a-coin mark for the second time in its life, the People’s
Bank of China (PBoC) announced it was investigating bitcoin
trading on Chinese exchanges.  Shortly after, the PBoC issued
new regulations for the trading of bitcoin on exchanges within
the country, including curtailing margin trading, requiring
trading fees, and demanding stronger anti–money laundering
and know-your-customer protocols. All of these requirements
were understandable and have helped to legitimize bitcoin, but
they did lead to a noticeable decline in Chinese trading
volume, which for much of 2016 was still greater than 90
percent of trading volumes worldwide in bitcoin.
China was responsible for over 90 percent of all bitcoin
trading volume worldwide, and now the PBoC was placing
restrictions on this activity. The situation was eerily similar to
a late 2013 incident, when the PBoC rolled out new
regulations after bitcoin crossed the $1,000 mark for the first
time.  Bitcoin’s price crashed then, and continued to decline
for over a year, and many feared the same would happen after
the PBoC’s commentary in 2017. While the price did initially
fall precipitously, within a month it had recovered, and would
shortly move to all-time highs. This was a very different
reaction than 2013.
Bitcoin’s price resilience in 2017, compared to the
devastating price impact in 2013, reveals a valuable lesson for
9
10
11

the innovative investor on the importance of trading volumes,
exchange diversity, and trading pair diversity. In December
2013, trading volumes averaged $60 million, whereas in
December 2016 they averaged $4.1 billion. Hence, there was
significantly more market depth leading into the PBoC
announcement in 2017 than there was in 2013. Furthermore, in
2013 bitcoin trading occurred on a much more limited number
of exchanges (most activity was at Mt. Gox). Currency pair
diversity was not nearly as robust either, both through
different fiat currencies or other cryptoassets.
In 2017, bitcoin was able to recover quickly because market
liquidity, exchange diversity, and trading pair optionality came
through in spades. As a result, when the PBoC issued its
regulations, there were plenty of other investors and traders
outside of China to pick up the slack, leading to an inversion
in market share of fiat currencies used to trade bitcoin, as
shown in Figure 9.4. The Chinese yuan’s percent of market
share fell from 90+ percent to less than 10 percent.

Figure 9.4 
 Share of bitcoin trading volume in various currency pairs, highlighting
the drop in the Chinese yuan’s share in January 2017

The increase of dollar and yen trading in bitcoin is dramatic
after January 22, 2017. Traders of bitcoin weren’t rattled by
the Chinese regulations for long, and increased investments
from the United States and Japan filled the void and buoyed
bitcoin’s price.
TRADING PAIR DIVERSITY AS A SIGN
OF MATURITY FOR CRYPTOASSETS
Balancing the diversity of exchanges and trading pairs is
important for the robustness of any asset, including

cryptoassets. Learning from bitcoin’s reliance on too few
currencies and exchanges early in its young life, we can now
follow the trading pair diversity of other cryptoassets,
especially with regard to fiat currency pairs.
Fiat currency pairs are particularly important for
cryptoassets because they require significant integration with
preexisting financial infrastructures. Due to high levels of
required compliance, only a small number of cryptoasset
exchanges offer the capability to accept fiat currency or
connect to investors’ bank accounts. These exchanges, such as
Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit, Gemini, Kraken, and a few others, are
hesitant to provide access to all cryptoassets, as they do not
want to encourage trading in those that are not reputable.
Given their caution, it is a stamp of approval for a cryptoasset
to be added to their platforms.
Ethereum’s ether provides a study on how exchanges
adding a cryptoasset can increase the diversity of the trading
pairs used to buy the asset. If our hypothesis on the importance
of fiat currencies in cryptoasset trading holds, then as an asset
grows in maturity and legitimacy, it should have more
diversity in its trading pairs, with particularly strong growth in
fiat currencies being used to buy the asset.
That has certainly been the case with ether. In Figure 9.5
we can see that over the course of 2016 the diversity in trading
pairs used to buy it has grown significantly. The dollar has
shown particular strength, and overall fiat currencies have
increased from less than 10 percent of ether’s trading volume
in the spring of 2016 to nearly 50 percent in the spring of
2017.
We encourage the innovative investor to monitor the

increase of trading pair diversity as a way to check the
growing robustness and maturity of a single cryptoasset within
the broader asset class. CryptoCompare.com is a good tool to
identify these trends.

DECREASING VOLATILITY AS A
CRYPTOASSET MATURES
Greater trading volumes, liquidity, exchange diversity, and
trading pair diversity all lead to more resilience in the market.
The cryptoasset is better able to absorb shocks without wild
price swings—or at least with price swings that are
diminishing in severity over time—which translates into a

decrease in volatility.
We should expect to see decreasing volatility in
cryptoassets when we plot this volatility over time. Since we
already covered bitcoin’s decreasing volatility in Chapter 7,
we will showcase the other cryptoassets here. Figures 9.6, 9.7,
and 9.8 show the volatility of ether, ripple, and monero over
time. The following figures were made using CryptoCompare
data, which provides similar graphs for other cryptoassets.
From these trends, we can infer that this declining volatility
is a result of increased market maturity. Certainly, the trend is
not a straight line, and there are significant bumps in the road,
depending on particular events. For example, monero had a
spike in volatility in late 2016 because it experienced a
significant price rise. This shows that volatility is not only
associated with a tanking price but also a skyrocketing price.
The general trend, nonetheless, is of dampening volatility
(while not pictured in the following figures, Q2 and Q3 of
2017 were quite volatile for cryptoassets, underscoring that
decreasing volatility will not unfold in a straight line).

 Monero’s decreasing daily volatility
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
In Figure 9.9, we compare bitcoin, ether, and dash’s
volatility since the end of 2015. Bitcoin has the lowest
volatility because its markets are the most liquid and it has the
greatest diversity of support from different exchanges and
asset trading pairs. While bitcoin has sustained its low
volatility, ether has come down significantly, and dash has
varied widely. We included dash because we posit that it will
continue to have problems with volatility over time. While it is
gaining in acceptance, which should decrease its volatility, its
software architecture creates a liquidity problem by requiring
masternodes (entities similar to miners, but unique to Dash’s
architecture) to lock up a large amount of the dash
outstanding. Such a requirement impedes the liquidity of
dash’s markets, thereby making the markets more prone to
volatility.

Figure 9.9 
 Daily volatility of bitcoin, dash, and ether
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
Interestingly, just because an asset has a rapid price
increase doesn’t mean it must do so in a volatile manner. For
example, through 2016, bitcoin more than doubled in price but
decreased in volatility. Its daily gains and occasional losses
were close enough to the mean not to register as overly
volatile. Such behavior can indicate big traders are taking
positions in an asset; often they gauge how much they are
moving the price of an asset and make sure not to do so above
a certain percentage point. In this way, they minimize
volatility and slowly ease into a big position over a series of
days, weeks, or months.
As these assets mature and their volatility decreases, recall
that this can help boost the Sharpe ratio. Recall that since the
Sharpe ratio is absolute returns  divided by volatility, if
13

volatility comes down, then the returns don’t have to be as
stupendously good for the Sharpe ratio to still be a standout.
MARKETPLACE BEHAVIOR:
CORRELATIONS
As an asset class is first emerging, it will be uncorrelated with
the broader capital markets because there is not much overlap
between the early adopters of that asset and the broader capital
market investors. This is exactly what we saw with bitcoin
when it was first invented and was only known to a small core
group of developers and adopters (see Figure 9.10).
Figure 9.10  Cryptoassets as an emerging asset class
At that time, with minimal overlap between bitcoin and
capital market investors, bitcoin’s correlation with other
common asset classes was close to zero; events that made the

broader capital markets move had no effect on bitcoin, and
vice versa (see Figure 9.11).
Figure 9.11

from January 2011 to January 2017

As bitcoin’s use grew, so too did its fame. It is now
routinely discussed in publications such as the Wall Street
Journal, the New York Times, and Forbes on a near-weekly
basis. As a result, not only has it become part of the
conversation, it’s also becoming an investment vehicle for a
larger audience within the broader capital markets.  A
graphical depiction of the increased reach of cryptoassets can
be seen in Figure 9.12.
14

Figure 9.12  Cryptoassets as a mature asset class
Bitcoin’s increased acceptance among capital market
investors explains why it has surged on news that could be
detrimental to other markets, such as Brexit, the surprise
Trump election win, and the devaluation of the Chinese
yuan.  Despite the many PBoC interventions, Chinese
citizens used bitcoin to protect themselves against the erosion
in value of their national currency. Figure 9.13 holds the key
to inferring such behavior. On the left side of the figure, the y-
axis shows the number of Chinese yuan needed to buy one
dollar. As this number increases, the value of the Chinese yuan
decreases, because more yuan are needed to buy one dollar.
On the right side of the figure, the price of bitcoin is shown.
As the yuan decreases in value, the price of bitcoin increases.
Such a correlation implies that people are likely buying bitcoin
15

to protect themselves from further devaluation of the yuan.

While we expect to see bitcoin become increasingly
correlated—either positively or negatively—with other
broadly used asset classes, as new cryptoassets are born, they
will likely have a low to zero correlation with the broader
capital markets. At best, what they will show is some form of
correlation with bitcoin, as it is of the same asset class. It
should be expected that examples within an asset class will
move together in some fashion. For example, leading up to the
decision on the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF on March 10, 2017,
bitcoin became increasingly correlated with ether and monero,

and increasingly negatively correlated with litecoin (see Figure
9.14).
Since litecoin is such a close derivative of bitcoin, investors
likely became concerned that people would rotate out of
litecoin and move into bitcoin if the bitcoin ETF was
approved. Ether and monero, on the other hand, are
significantly different cryptoassets and therefore are held as
complementary to bitcoin in a crypto portfolio. As bitcoin rose
and fell, so too did these assets. This reinforces the need for
the innovative investor to become knowledgeable about these
assets’ specific characteristics and recognize where
correlations may or may not occur.

the SEC’s rejection of the Winklevoss ETF

We expect to see more of this correlation trend play out. At
best, newer cryptoassets will show some behavior tied to
bitcoin and its siblings, either positively or negatively. Then as
the cryptoasset grows, so too will its capital pool, and soon
enough this will overlap with more traditional assets,
strengthening its price relationship with the broader capital
markets.
Although we’re seeing maturation of these assets and
greater overlaps with others, it’s fair to consider bitcoin and
cryptoassets to be in their early stages. There is still a lack of
understanding by most investors. Innovative investors may be
more educated on this topic than most, but they will encounter
those who see cryptoassets as speculative pump-and-dump
vehicles or worse. The next two chapters will address these
arguments by putting cryptoassets in the context of the history
of past investment bubbles, scams, and speculation.

Chapter 10
The Speculation of Crowds
and “This Time Is Different”
Thinking
n its path to maturity, bitcoin’s price has experienced euphoric
rises and harrowing drops, as have many cryptoassets. One of
the most common complaints among bitcoin and cryptoasset
naysayers is that these fluctuations are driven by the Wild
West nature of the markets, implying that cryptoassets are a
strange new breed that can’t be trusted. While each cryptoasset
and its associated markets are at varying levels of maturity,
associating Wild West behavior as unique to cryptoasset
markets is misleading at best.
Equities, which many consider to be transacted on the most
transparent, efficient, and fair markets in the world, had a
rocky first couple of centuries. Yes, centuries. Not only were
these markets prone to mass speculation, as people raced to
buy and sell based on mostly fabricated rags-to-riches stories,
but many times the markets were rigged against participants.
Misleading prospectuses, manipulation of share prices, false
accounting, and issuance of forged paper shares all led to

losses.  The reality is that some of the most trusted markets in
the world today also had Wild West beginnings.
By examining the most famous examples of markets gone
wrong, specifically the sequence of events, the innovative
investor is better informed by history to protect present and
future wealth. When patterns reappear, it’s a good time to exit
right, or at least reassess one’s investment strategy. This
thinking is prudent with regard to any investment, including a
venture into cryptoassets.
These examples also show that cryptoassets are not going
through bizarre growing pains unique to them. Instead, they
are experiencing the same evolutionary process that new asset
classes over hundreds of years have had to go through as they
matured. For those interested in a thorough history of such
events, we highly recommend Edward Chancellor’s Devil
Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation.
While the way in which markets become dangerous to
investors changes over time, and often becomes less insidious
the more the asset and its associated markets mature, the
potential for markets to destabilize never disappears. Much of
the world learned that lesson during the financial crisis of
2008.
Broadly, we categorize five main patterns that lead to
markets destabilizing:
•   The speculation of crowds
•   “This time is different”
•   Ponzi schemes
•   Misleading information from asset issuers
•   Cornering
1

The first two will be detailed in this chapter, while the latter
three we reserve for the next chapter. In addition to historical
examples from decades past, we also give examples of how
these patterns have manifested in cryptoasset markets.
THE SPECULATION OF CROWDS
While often given a bad name, speculation in and of itself is
not a bad thing. For millennia, speculation has been integral to
markets and trading, with some of the earliest evidence
coming from second-century BC Rome.  The root of the word
speculate comes from the Latin specular, which means “to spy
out, watch, observe, examine, explore.”  Speculators are
keenly focused on the movement of the market, observing its
swings and taking action accordingly.
Speculators, generally, differ from investors in the duration
they intend to hold assets. They do not buy an asset with the
intent to hold it for years. Rather, they buy the asset for an
abbreviated period before selling it likely to the next
speculator. Sometimes they do this to capitalize on short-term
information they believe will move the market, other times
they do it because they expect to ride the momentum of the
market, regardless of its fundamentals. In short, they try to
profit within the roller-coaster ride.
In comparison, the innovative investor diligently
investigates the fundamentals of value for investing, and exits
that investment when the markets no longer appear rational.
In our view, no matter the investment, it’s important to
discern when one is investing and when one is speculating.
Benjamin Graham and David Dodd attempted to define the
2
3

difference between investing and speculation in their book
Security Analysis : “An investment operation is one which,
upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a
satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements
are speculative.”
In his book The Intelligent Investor,  Graham recognized
that speculation would always be present in the investing
world, but he saw a need to distinguish between “good” and
“bad” speculation.  He wrote, “There is intelligent speculation
as there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in
which speculation may be unintelligent.”
While speculators have often been scorned, they were
perhaps most famously denigrated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in
his inaugural address on March 4, 1933. As America was
struggling through the Great Depression, which many pinned
on the stock market crash of 1929, there was strong resentment
against speculators. Every crisis loves a scapegoat. In his
speech, Roosevelt called them “money changers” to invoke
religious judgment:
Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods have
failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have
admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous
money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by
the hearts and minds of men.
True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an
outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the
lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our
people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations,
pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a
generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision
the people perish.
The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our
civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The
4
5
6

measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values
more noble than mere monetary profit.
While Roosevelt’s judgment is understandable, market
realities show that speculation has its place in the investment
world. Speculators often jump on opportunities more quickly
than does a typical investor, which begins the process of
pricing new information into the value of an asset. In seeking
to profit from opportunity, speculators help drive the search
between buyers and sellers for a mutually agreed upon price.
When a shortage of an asset is on the horizon, whether it be
energy commodities or electronic hardware, speculators will
quickly bid up the price of that good. As a result, more
suppliers are drawn to the market, accelerating the alleviation
of the shortage in classic supply and demand economics.
When it comes to innovation, such as the introduction of
railroads, automobiles, or the Internet, speculation served to
allocate money to the rapid buildout of the infrastructures
necessary to support these sweeping innovations. Speculators
are the ones who first allocate money because they have the
highest tolerance for risk and are always on the lookout for
new information. While speculation typically ends with a
supply glut because too much money eventually pours into the
innovation, the glut is often temporary. The arrival and
implementation of copious amounts of capital may lead to an
excess of capacity, but as the innovation gains mass adoption
over the following decades, the abundance of infrastructure
proves useful. Such was the case with the rapid buildout of
railways in Europe in the mid-1800s and the deployment of
fiber optic cables to support the Internet in the 1990s.
Single speculators, or small groups of them, typically do
7

not destabilize markets. It is when the groups turn into crowds
that the negative ramifications build. In this sense, the vitriol
should not be directed so much at speculation, but instead at
crowd behavior that overtakes the capital markets.
Crowd theory was pioneered by Gustave Le Bon, whose
most famous work was The Crowd: A Study of the Popular
Mind. In his later book The Psychology of Revolution, Le Bon
wrote:
Man, as part of a multitude, is a very different being from the same man as
an isolated individual. His conscious individuality vanishes in the
unconscious personality of the crowd… . Among the other characteristics of
crowds, we must note their infinite credulity and exaggerated sensibility,
their short-sightedness, and their incapacity to respond to the influences of
reason. Affirmation, contagion, repetition, and prestige constitute almost the
only means of persuading them. Reality and experience have no effect upon
them.
These characteristics are dangerous in the context of a
market. Credulity, or to be more direct, gullibility, leads the
masses to readily believe what they are told, whether by fellow
speculators or the management behind different assets coming
to market.
Credulity is often what draws individual speculators to the
crowd, and once there, the speculator is trapped within
groupthink. The four characteristics of persuasion Le Bon
mentions only exacerbate the situation: Affirmation leads the
credulous to more strongly believe in their strategies when the
market continues to go up, and that thinking spreads like a
contagion. This pattern is repeated, again and again, as the
speculators chase the returns of the most prestigious of assets.
Unfortunately, when the market turns and the prestige is gone,
the contagion of terror spreads just as quickly through the
8

speculative crowd.
Tulipmania
The most famous instance of mass speculation in a commodity
happened in the Dutch Republic in the 1630s. As with most
periods of mass speculation, the time was right. With their
merchants fueling trade, the Dutch enjoyed the highest salaries
of any in Europe, financial innovation was in the air, and
money was free-flowing. Shares of the Dutch East India
Company had been rewarding shareholders handsomely for
their investments.  Fueled by enthusiasm, wealthy citizens
poured money into properties, leading to a robust housing
market. The ongoing appreciation of asset values created an
excess of wealth to fund further asset purchases, setting up a
positively reinforcing feedback loop into asset bubble
territory.
While the wealthy sowed the grounds for an asset bubble,
initially not everyone could take part. Dutch East India shares
were expensive and illiquid, making them inaccessible to all
but the rich, and the same went for prized properties.
A tulip, on the other hand, was much more affordable. Yet
due to a quirk of nature, an affordable tulip had the potential to
morph into one that would make its owner rich. A virus
transmitted by aphids turned solid-colored tulips into a prized
variegated variety, with streaks of lighter hues through darker
colors, resembling flames.  The cause of such variegation
was not known at the time and so lent itself to speculation, as
people tried to predict which tulips would develop the unique
coloration.
On the other side of the transformation, however, was
9
10
11

death, as the virus eventually killed the tulip. Speculators,
therefore, passed the tulips around like hot potatoes, hoping
they could sell them to the next speculator for a higher price,
until the last person was left with a claim on a dead tulip.
Tulips had promised value since their introduction to
Europe in the mid-1500s, but it was not until 1634 and the
spread of the virus that prices increased exponentially, causing
what is commonly referred to as Tulipmania. What began with
small groups of speculators turned into crowds of speculators,
as outsiders from other countries were drawn to Dutch tulip
markets upon hearing stories of the immense riches to be
gained. Meanwhile, the experienced withdrew from
participation or shunned the tulip trade, as explained by
Chancellor:
The wealthy amateur bulb collectors, who had long shown a readiness to
pay vast sums for the rarer varieties, withdrew their custom as prices began
to soar, while the great Amsterdam merchants continued investing their
trading profits in town houses, East India stock, or bills of exchange—for
them, tulips remained merely an expression of wealth, not a means to that
end.
Since much of a tulip’s life is spent as a bulb and not a
blossom, it lends itself to a futures market, which the Dutch
called a windhandel, or the wind trade.  A futures market is
where a buyer and a seller agree to the future price of a good.
When that specific time arrives, the buyer must pay the seller
the agreed upon amount.
However, in those days, waiting for that agreed-upon time
was not fast enough for the crowds of speculators. The tulip
futures contracts themselves were traded, sometimes as many
as 10 times in a day.  Considering these trades were made
person to person, 10 trades in a day was representative of a
12
13
14

liquid and frenzied market.
With the futures market, the value of tulips could be
abstracted even more. People didn’t have to worry about the
actual delivery of the tulip—they just had to make sure they
could sell the contract for a higher price than they themselves
had bought it for. While the frenzy over tulips had been
building for a few years, the mania peaked during the winter
of late 1636 and early 1637, when the tulip bulbs were still
dormant in the ground. Therefore, the period of greatest
speculation during Tulipmania was not accompanied by a
single blossoming tulip changing hands.
Two factors made the crowd speculation even worse.
According to a study in The Economist, government officials
were in on the action themselves and moved to change the
futures contracts to options. The result was that:
Investors who had bought the right to buy tulips in the future were no longer
obliged to buy them. If the market price was not high enough for investors’
liking, they could pay a small fine and cancel the contract. The balance
between risk and reward in the tulip market was skewed massively in
investors’ favour. The inevitable result was a huge increase in tulip options
prices.
The second factor was that much of the trade began to be
financed by notes of personal credit. Therefore, not only were
the bulbs not changing hands, neither was physical money.
Transactions were made on simple promises to deliver money
in the future.
It should be clear to the innovative investor that the
delusion of value here was created by the frenzy of a crowd.
As Chancellor points out, “By the later stages of the mania, the
fusion of the windhandel with paper credit created the perfect
symmetry of insubstantiality: most transactions were for tulip
15
16

bulbs that could never be delivered because they didn’t exist
and were paid for with credit notes that could never be
honored because the money wasn’t there.”
Cheap credit often fuels asset bubbles, as seen with the
housing bubble that led to the financial crisis of 2008.
Similarly, cryptoasset bubbles can be created using extreme
margin on some exchanges, where investors are effectively
gambling with money they don’t have.
Back to tulips. At that time, the guilder served as currency
in the Dutch Republic. Paper money didn’t exist; instead,
metal that held real value was used. Each guilder contained
0.027 ounces of gold. Therefore, 37 guilders held an ounce of
gold, and 592 guilders contained a pound of gold. The highest
recorded amount paid for a tulip was 5,200 guilders, or the
equivalent of nearly nine pounds of gold.  At that time, an
average year’s work yielded 200 to 400 guilders, and modest
town houses could be bought for 300 guilders. The tulip that
fetched nine pounds of gold was worth the equivalent of 18
modest town houses: speculators were paying for single tulips
with what would take them over a decade to pay off, and with
money they didn’t have.
It all came crashing down in February 1637. Spring was
approaching, and tulips would be blossoming soon.
Contractual dates would soon require the conversion of the
notes of credit into real money. The merchants that drove the
economic machine were largely unaffected, because they had
“continued investing their trading profits in town houses, East
India stock, or bills of exchange.”  While it was the wealth of
these merchants that caused the masses to yearn for similar
riches, the merchants were unscathed by the crash they
17
18

precipitated. The crash did not set off a recession throughout
the economy, which was one saving grace of Tulipmania.
It was the common people, less experienced in investing,
that had been swept up in the madness of the crowd who were
the hardest hit. Fights over the amount due per contract
ensued. A little over a year after the bubble burst, the Dutch
government stepped in to declare that the contracts could be
settled for 3.5 percent of their initial value. While a marked
improvement over paying the full contract, 3.5 percent of the
most expensive tulip would still require a year’s work for
some unlucky citizens.
The Speculation of Crowds Comes to Cryptoassets
As with Tulipmania, cryptoassets are vulnerable to the
speculation of crowds. This is especially true as people fixate
on the incredible returns some early bitcoin investors enjoyed
and hope that the latest cryptocurrency, cryptocommodity, or
cryptotoken will make them rich too.
However, remember that just because the unfettered
enthusiasm of a crowd takes an asset to unreasonable highs
doesn’t mean the asset itself is flawed. Tulips are still enjoyed
and sold worldwide. And as we saw with the tech and telecom
boom, there were gems such as Amazon and Salesforce that
would reward their patient investors spectacularly for years to
come. The investors who got burned were the ones who
bought because everyone else was buying, and then sold
because everyone else was selling. The best way to avoid
getting burned in this manner is to do proper due diligence and
have an investment plan that is adhered to. If the urge is to buy
the asset because everyone else is buying it and it keeps going

up, then it’s likely best to walk away from any consideration
of that investment. Speculative bubbles are particularly
dangerous when there is no underlying long-term value
proposition to the asset. In these cases, it’s as bad as gambling
(or worse, as there’s an illusion of value).
We sometimes hear skeptical investors warn of the dangers
of bitcoin. Nout Wellink, the former president of the Dutch
Central Bank, is famous for saying, “This is worse than the
tulip mania. At least then you got a tulip, now you get
nothing.”  While we understand that some may have a hard
time grasping that something with no physical form could
have value, at this point in its life, bitcoin is a far cry from
tulips.
The key to understanding bitcoin’s value is recognizing it
has utility as “Money-over-Internet-Protocol” (MoIP)—
allowing it to move large amounts of value to anyone
anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes—which drives
demand for it beyond mere speculation. While tulips have
aesthetic appeal, it is a stretch to argue that their utility is on
par with MoIP in the digital age. It’s important to investigate
the underlying utility of any other cryptoasset that the
innovative investor may be considering.
That said, bitcoin has had periods when crowds
momentarily overtook the markets. These times are
worthwhile to examine and learn from, and it’s important to
note that bitcoin has always recovered from these periods of
mass speculation, a major differentiator from tulips. There are
six periods over the last eight years when the crowd
temporarily controlled the bitcoin market. The innovative
investor will take note that the power of crowds to move
19

bitcoin’s markets has been moderating over time. We include
this dive into bitcoin’s speculative past to help inform future
investigation of cryptoassets as they come to market and
inevitably get swept up in periods of mass speculation.
Bitcoin Bubbles
When Mt. Gox was established, bitcoin finally became
accessible to the mainstream. Prior to this point, bitcoin
holders had mostly been computer and cryptography wizzes,
acquiring bitcoin as a function of running the computers that
supported the network. Figure 10.1 shows the price action of
bitcoin on a log scale since the start of Mt. Gox. Recall that
charts with log scales are good at showing the percent price
appreciation of an asset over time. On a linear scale, the early
years of bitcoin’s price appreciation would be less evident.
Figure 10.1  Bitcoin’s price action from Mt. Gox until early 2017
Data sourced from CoinDesk
What is immediately apparent is bitcoin’s price
appreciation in the year following the opening of Mt. Gox.

When Mt. Gox opened, bitcoin was worth less than $0.10, and
just a year later it was worth over $10. While $10 may not
sound like much, consider that in the period of a year bitcoin
increased 100-fold, meaning that a $100 investment had turned
into $10,000.
Another significant leg up was in November 2013, when
bitcoin made its infamous run past the price of $1,000 per coin
for the first time. While many people new to the space think
that was bitcoin’s first bubble, in fact, it had many bubbles
before that. Figure 10.2 shows the percentage change in
bitcoin’s price over 30-day periods, or what is known as
month-over-month appreciation. It becomes clear that bitcoin
has experienced six one-month periods when it doubled in
price.
Figure 10.2 
 Bitcoin’s history of doubling price in a one-month period

Data sourced from CoinDesk
Three of these doublings happened in the year after the
opening of Mt. Gox. The last ascent during this period was the
most phenomenal, when on May 13, 2011, the price increased
more than 700 percent over the previous month. While there
were respective drivers to these price runs, by and large they
were fueled by the ability of more mainstream users to gain
access to bitcoin through Mt. Gox. Small pieces of information
created snowball effects that took the market by storm.
To understand how these bubbles unfolded, it is helpful to
quantify certain aspects. First, we will define a bitcoin bubble
cycle as being recognizable on the first day that bitcoin’s price
has doubled from its price 30 days prior. The bubble ends
when the price stops falling from the month prior, firming up
with month-over-month gains for three straight days. These
bubbles are visible on bitcoin’s price chart in Figure 10.3.
Figure 10.3  Bitcoin’s price bubbles
Data sourced from CoinDesk

Price bubbles after the launch of Mt. Gox peaked at the
following prices on the following dates:
•   November 6, 2010: $0.39
•   February 9, 2011: $1.09
•   June 8, 2011: $29.60
•   January 8, 2012: $7.11
•   April 9, 2013: $230
•   December 4, 2013: $1,147
Clearly, the time periods soon after the launch of Mt. Gox
were particularly exciting, but also at times harrowing. On the
other side of every peak there is a dangerous trough, and
bitcoin investors in these bubbles were not spared. Within the
period defined as a bitcoin bubble, the average decline from
peak price to trough price was 63 percent. The bubbles that
peaked in June 2011 and December 2013 were particularly
devastating, with losses of 93 percent and 85 percent
respectively.
More insidious than the precipitous nature of the losses is
how they unfolded compared to the rises. Sharp rises are often
characterized by investor exuberance, quickly escalating as
more and more jubilantly pile in. The falls, on the other hand,
are sustained excruciation. The pattern is qualitatively visible
in Figure 10.3, as the ascent to the peak of a bubble is like a
rocket taking off, while the decent is more like a parachute
drifting to the ground.
The longer duration of descents as opposed to ascents is
important for the innovative investor to keep in mind, as
sometimes it may feel like the drop from the peak of a bubble
will never end. Immature investors will typically cry out in

defeat when they can’t tolerate further losses. Sadly, these last
cries of capitulation are often when a bear market is getting
ready to turn around.
The Steemit Bubble
A large number of cryptoassets other than bitcoin have gone
through similar stratospheric ascents, fueled by the speculation
of crowds, and corresponding descents. A good example was
in the middle of 2016, when the new blockchain architecture
Steemit caught everyone’s attention. Its premise was to
provide an open publishing or blogging platform on which
authors who wrote good articles and posts were rewarded by
readers with the cryptoasset steem. Steemit served as a
decentralized Reddit of sorts, with flavors of the blogging site
Medium mixed in. The architecture was supported by a
convoluted, albeit innovative, flow of monetary policy
between miners, content creators, content curators, and more.
On July 1, 2016, the total network value of Steemit was
around $16 million. Two weeks later it was around $350
million, a more than 20-fold increase.  Such rapid changes in
price are almost always fueled by mass speculation and not
fundamental growth. Behavior changes slowly, and many of
the use cases put forth by cryptoassets will require the
mainstream to adapt to these new platforms. Speculators, on
the other hand, move quickly.
As shown in Figure 10.4, steem’s price in bitcoin terms
would fall from its mid-July peak by 94 percent three months
later, and by 97 percent at the end of the year. This doesn’t
mean the platform is bad. Rather, it shows how the speculation
and excitement about its prospects fueled a sharp rise and fall
20

in price.

The Zcash Bubble
One of the most meteoric rises and crashes was the October
2016 rollout of the new privacy-focused cyptocurrency zcash
(ZEC). Few cryptocurrencies have been more anticipated than
this one, and rightfully so, given its strong engineering team.
Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin was an advisor and described
Zcash as providing the “advantages of using a public
blockchain, while still being sure that their private information
is protected.”  Two well-regarded cryptoasset investment
firms, Pantera Capital and Digital Currency Group, were
involved with Zcash as well. Zcash technology targeted the
privacy-centric vertical that dash and monero occupied, both
21

of which were in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies in terms of
network value when zcash was released. The excitement was
palpable.
Integral to the ensuing price bubble was how the Zcash
team structured the issuance of zcash, which they did with
good intention. As we discussed in Chapter 5, they chose to
follow an issuance model similar to bitcoin’s, which meant
that upon launch of its blockchain there would be zero units of
zcash outstanding. From zero units outstanding, all units
would be issued organically through miners competing to add
blocks to Zcash’s blockchain and getting paid with newly
minted zcash via coinbase transactions. The Zcash team had
implemented a further tweak, known as a slow-start, that
would limit the initial size of coinbase transactions  to
miners. The slow-start was intended as a safety feature in case
there were any bugs in Zcash’s code. This prudent model was
markedly different from the crowdsale model that many
cryptoassets have been pursuing (which will be discussed
further in Chapter 16), but it also drastically limited the initial
supply.
Zcash frenzy was stoked further by the recent increase in
popularity of futures trading of cryptoassets. One exchange
known as BitMEX began offering futures prior to the launch
of zcash, which spiked to 10 bitcoin per zcash.
The combination of limited initial supply with widespread
demand led to a classic supply shortage that boosted the price
of zcash. On the first day of trading, the coin momentarily
achieved a price of 3,300 bitcoin, or more than $2 million
dollars per zcash, on Poloniex.  Within two days it had
crashed below 1 bitcoin per zcash and continued to fall,
22
23
24

closing out 2016 at a price of .05 bitcoin per zcash, or roughly
$48.  While zcash has since stabilized and continues to hold
great promise as a cryptoasset, its rocky start was caused by
mass speculation.
Words of Warning for the Innovative Investor Tempted by
Bubbles
Robert Shiller, author, professor, and Nobel Prize winner,
defined a bubble as “a social epidemic that involves
extravagant expectations for the future.”  We’ve talked much
about the expectations for the future of cryptoassets.
However, we also believe innovative investors must be
grounded in common sense in order to identify proper
investments from improper ones, and they need to recognize
when buying opportunities exist and when the madness of the
crowd has taken over. When a cryptoasset is skyrocketing, it
can be hard to resist the urge to jump in and ride the rocket.
However, the timing can be precarious, and spotting the end of
a bubble is not easy. By the time the bubble is popping and the
speculation of crowds has turned on itself, it’s often too late.
Alan Greenspan encapsulated the idea nicely: “You can spot a
bubble. They’re obvious in every respect. But it is impossible
for the majority of participants in the market to call the date
when it blows. Every bubble by definition deflates.”
“THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT”
When asset markets are taken over by mass speculation and
prices reach nosebleed territory, a common refrain can often
be heard: “This time is different.” Typically, the logic goes
25
26
27

that the markets have evolved from more primitive years, and
financial engineering innovations have led to robust markets
that can’t possibly crash. Time and again this thesis has been
refuted by subsequent market crashes. In their well-regarded
book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial
Folly, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff deliver a 300-
page tour de force to prove that this time is never different.
They describe how “this time is different” thinking was
used to justify the sustainability of jubilant markets prior to the
1929 crash that led to the Great Depression. Proponents of
“this time is different” thinking claimed that business cycles
had been cured by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.
The thinking was that the Federal Reserve could use monetary
policy to boost economies when production and consumption
were flagging, and they could reel in markets when they
showed signs of overheating. Others pointed to increasing free
trade, declining inflation, and scientific methods being applied
to corporate management that were leading to much more
accurate production and inventory levels.
In the October 16, 1929, issue of the New York Times, Yale
economist Irving Fisher declared, “Stock prices have reached
what looks like a permanently high plateau.”  His
proclamation would go down as the worst stock tip in history,
as eight days later the market dropped by 11 percent. On
October 28, it would fall another 13 percent, and on October
29 another 12 percent. A month after this declaration was
printed in the New York Times, Fisher went broke and the Dow
had lost almost half its value prior to the crash.
Similar thinking characterized the tech-and-telecom boom
in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As eloquently described by
28
29
30

Chancellor:
The 1990s bull market was accompanied by the reappearance of a new era
ideology similar to that of the 1920s. Known as the “new paradigm,” or the
“Goldilocks economy” (like the porridge in the fairy tale it was neither too
hot nor too cold), the theory suggested that the control of inflation by the
Federal Reserve, the decline in the federal deficit, the opening of global
markets, the restructuring of corporate America, and the widespread use of
information technology to control inventory stock levels had combined to
do away with the business cycle. Point for point, this was a reiteration of the
new era philosophy of Irving Fisher’s day.
Similar to the 1920s, in the 1990s stock analysts and
investment managers rationalized the expensive markets with
the claim that the old methods of valuing companies no longer
applied. There were new methods that justified the nosebleed
prices.
The Same Patterns Persist
The idea of valuation, which we will tackle in the next
chapters, is a particularly challenging one for cryptoassets.
Since they are a new asset class, they cannot be valued as
companies are, and while valuing them based on supply and
demand characteristics like that of commodities has some
validity, it doesn’t quite suffice. As a result, we predict that as
the space grows, and likely to dizzying levels, we’ll once
again hear the refrain that old methods of valuation no longer
apply. When the innovative investor hears that refrain, it will
be important to stay on high alert and investigate if the new
method of valuation really makes sense.
Throughout this book, we’ve tried to stay on message that
the innovative investor may be a new class of investor, just as
cryptoassets are a new asset class. However, we’ve also been
31
32

reminding readers of lessons to be learned from the past and
time-tested tools of portfolio and asset analysis. Ignoring these
important lessons will lead people into the trap of thinking that
not only are things different this time, but that they are
different from other investors as well.
Generally, these traps follow a pattern: initially, there may
be support for the underlying price appreciation, as with most
fundamental innovations. But that price appreciation and the
story behind it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. People
become entranced by stories of their friends and family
making easy money, even when they knew little about what
they bought. In times like these (as in Tulipmania), many
subscribe to the “greater idiot” ideal: people can make money
so long as they are able to sell the asset at a higher price to an
idiot greater than them. A key indicator of the unsustainability
of mass speculation is when new and inexperienced entrants
stream into the markets.
Bubbles are typically worsened by cheap credit, as financial
institutions provide speculators the means to take out loans so
they can buy more of the asset than they could with cash on
hand. In this sense, the financial institutions buy into the
speculative bubble as they see the opportunity to make money,
just as the institutions around them are making money off
loans to frenzied speculators. Both individual speculators and
financial institutions providing cheap credit fall into the rut of
crowd theory and convince themselves that “this time is
different.”
To make matters worse, when markets are overheating is
usually when misleading asset issuers, Ponzi operators, and
market manipulators come out to play. For that reason, we’ll

turn to these three themes in the next chapter.

T
Chapter 11
“It’s Just a Ponzi Scheme,
Isn’t It?”
he example of Tulipmania and similar events should remind
the innovative investor that bubbles can appear quickly and
violently, especially in cryptoassets. These patterns have been
repeated in bitcoin’s bubbles, steem’s stratospheric summer
rise, and zcash’s postrelease run. Given the emerging nature of
the cryptoasset markets, it’s important to recognize that there
is less regulation (some would say none) in this arena, and
therefore bad behavior can persist for longer than it may in
more mature markets.
As activity grows in the bitcoin and cryptoasset markets,
investors must look beyond the madness of the crowd and
recognize that there are bad actors who seek easy prey in these
young markets. The growth of new cryptoassets and new
investment products around them create a rapidly evolving
marketplace in which financial criminals can exploit profit-
seeking motives, especially if the innovative investor doesn’t
perform proper due diligence. This chapter will focus on Ponzi
schemes, misleading asset issuers, and the cornering of

markets (also known as “pump and dump” schemes).
As we’ve mentioned, those who lack an understanding of
bitcoin and cryptoassets often express their disdain and
ignorance with the proclamation, “It’s just a Ponzi scheme.”
So let’s start there.
PONZI SCHEMES
Ponzi schemes, also referred to as pyramid schemes, are the
most dangerous type of misleading asset. While it got its name
from Charles Ponzi, an Italian who lived from 1882 to 1949, it
existed before he was born; he just made it famous.
The idea is simple: new investors pay old investors. As
long as there are enough new investors, old investors will
continue to be rewarded handsomely. For example, if an
operator of a Ponzi scheme offered 20 percent returns into
perpetuity, some investors would be duped into initially
believing the operator. Call this “Batch A” of investors. The
operator would encourage Batch A investors to tell their
friends, who would become Batch B of even newer investors.
The money Batch B investors invested would pay the 20
percent returns promised to the Batch A investors who brought
them into the scheme. From there, Batch A and Batch B go
and solicit Batch C, telling Batch C about this amazingly easy
and rewarding investment product. The capital from Batch C
goes to pay Batch A and Batch B, and so the Ponzi cycle
continues indefinitely until there are not enough new investors
to keep it going. The scheme falls apart when people realize
no real value has been created, and everything is founded upon
a scheme to dupe new investors into paying old investors.

Tragically, investors often don’t realize they are duping one
another, and it is the operator of the Ponzi scheme who makes
out handsomely.
Before we turn to cryptoassets, let’s look at how Ponzi
schemes have played out in traditional assets.
Many think of bonds as a safe investment with steady cash
flows. If they are issued by a government, then they also have
the full backing of that government. As we will soon see,
bonds have not always been safe, and in what has been labeled
the first emerging market boom, many bonds turned out to be
Ponzi schemes.
For about a century after the equity bubbles brought on by
the Mississippi Company  and South Sea Schemes  (we’ll
cover the shady dealings of these companies in the next
section), British investors stuck close to government-issued
bonds.  During the Napoleonic Wars from 1803 to 1815, the
British government issued over 400 million pounds of bonds,
providing plenty of opportunity to bond investors. However,
once peace reigned again, the British government had less
need to borrow, and therefore the supply of government bonds
shrank.
At about the same time, South America was in the throes of
rebellion against Spain, leading to the creation of new
countries with a need for capital to build their infrastructure
and join the developed world. An English newspaper claimed,
“We may indulge the brightest hopes of these Southern
Republics. They have entered upon a career of endless
improvement. And … will soon attain the knowledge and
freedom and civilization of the happiest states of Europe.”
The opportunity to make money was the focus of hungry
1
2
3
4
5
6

British investors, and it was fueled by stories of how British
innovation would make these regions economic powerhouses,
and that fabled gold and silver mines were up for grabs.
Investors ended up dumping millions into these exotic and
high-yielding loans, with little to no information on where the
money ended up. For the most part, bonds were issued
repeatedly to budding countries such as Chile, Colombia, and
Peru, with the newer issues going to pay off the older issues in
classic Ponzi finance. As put forth by Chancellor in his book,
Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation:
The payment of interest from capital, otherwise known as “Ponzi finance,”
created the illusion of viability although no money was ever actually sent
from South America to service the loans (to which it must be added that the
borrowing countries received only a tiny fraction of the total sums for which
they contracted).
In other words, not only did very little of the money raised in
Europe ever make it to South America for its intended
purpose, but little to no money was ever sent from South
America back to Europe to pay for the dividends the bonds
promised. In one famous instance, there wasn’t even the
possibility of repayment, as the bonds were floated for an
imaginary country called Poyais. These Poyaisian bonds
remain the only bond for a fake country to be issued on the
London Stock Exchange.
As with all Ponzi finance, the South American loan bubble
had to burst, which it did in 1826. Every newly founded South
American country defaulted on its debt, except for Brazil, in
what has become known as “The First Latin American Debt
Crisis.”  Not only would this bubble hurt European investors,
it would hurt South America for decades to come, arguably
even to the present as the region has been marred by continued
7
8

defaults. For example, Chile, Colombia, and Peru have spent
27.5 percent, 36.2 percent, and 40.2 percent of their sovereign
lives in default or rescheduling, never quite able to escape the
early precedent that was set.
The Bitcoin Ponzi Myth
Criticisms of bitcoin and cryptoassets being Ponzi schemes
have been circulating since bitcoin first hit investors’ radar
screens.  However, this criticism is deeply misinformed, and
the World Bank has joined us in this opinion. In a 2014 report
it states:
Contrary to a widely-held opinion, Bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi. And
there is little to learn by treating it as such. The main value of Bitcoin may,
in retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the
prospects of electronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut
transactions cost.
Historical Ponzi schemes require a central authority to hide the
facts and promise a certain annual percent return. Bitcoin has
neither. The system is decentralized, and the facts are out in
the open. People can sell any time, and they do, and no one is
guaranteed any return. In fact, many longtime advocates of the
space warn people not to invest more money than they’re
willing to lose. Any good Ponzi operator would never say as
much.
How to Spot a Ponzi Scheme Disguised as a Cryptoasset
The Ponzi scheme is a specific and easily identifiably structure
that isn’t applicable to Bitcoin but could be to some phony
cryptoassets. While a truly innovative cryptoasset and its
associated architecture requires a heroic coding effort from
9
10
11

talented developers, because the software is open source, it can
be downloaded and duplicated. From there, a new cryptoasset
can be issued wrapped in slick marketing. If the innovative
investor doesn’t do proper due diligence on the underlying
code or read other trusted sources who have, then it’s possible
to fall victim to a Ponzi scheme.
A new cryptoasset called OneCoin was met with much
interest due to its promise of providing a guaranteed return to
investors. When the words “guaranteed return” appear, the
innovative investor should always see an instant red flag. All
investors should always be deterred by an investment that
purports a guarantee (although annuities or other insurance-
backed investments may qualify).
Millions of dollars poured into OneCoin, whose technology
ran counter to the values of the cryptoasset community: its
software was not open source (perhaps out of fear that
developers would see the holes in its design), and it was not
based on a public ledger, so no transactions could be tracked.
The community responded with reports of OneCoin as a
Ponzi scheme. One of the best articles on the topic, which
received nearly 300,000 views and over 1,000 comments, was
loud and clear: “Buyer Beware! The Definitive OneCoin Ponzi
Exposé.”  The Swedish Bitcoin Foundation stepped up to the
plate as well, with warnings about OneCoin as a “pyramid”
and a “fraud.” The Financial Conduct Authority in the United
Kingdom also warned investors against OneCoin.  The swift
action revealed the strength of a self-policing, open-source
community in pursuit of the truth.
To warn investors against Ponzi schemes like OneCoin, the
SEC released a memo titled “Investor Alert: Ponzi Schemes
12
13
14

Using Virtual Currencies.” The memo warned that
cryptoassets can be an easy way for scammers to disguise
pyramid schemes.  Investors should still consider this alert,
not in thinking of bitcoin as a scam but in recognizing that
scams may masquerade as cryptoassets. Here are a few of the
most important ways to recognize a Ponzi scheme:
•   Overly consistent returns
•   Secretive and/or complex strategies and fee structures
•   Difficulty receiving payments
•   Comes through someone with a shared affinity
Just as investors duped by the allure of Latin American bonds
should have been more cautious, the innovative investor needs
to keep an eye out for new cryptoasset issues that don’t quite
smell right.
We will go more deeply into specific vetting strategies
regarding cryptoassets in later chapters, but two “smell tests”
are easy to begin with. First, do a quick Google search for “Is
_______ a scam?” If nothing pops up, then check to see if the
project’s code is open source. This can best be accomplished
by searching for, “_________ GitHub,” as most of these
projects use GitHub as their platform for collaboration. If
nothing pops up with signs of the code on GitHub, then the
cryptoasset is likely not open source, which is an immediate
red flag that a cryptoasset and investment should be avoided.
MISLEADING INFORMATION FROM
ASSET ISSUERS
Ponzi schemes are a particularly perverse form of misleading
15

information from asset issuers. However, sometimes the way
in which issuers mislead investors is subtler. As markets
mature over time, there is more regulation on what
information asset issuers must provide and by whom that
information must be verified and audited. With cryptoassets,
however, these standards are not yet in place. To get an idea of
what havoc misleading asset issuers can create, we’ll examine
an example from early equities markets.
About 80 years after Tulipmania, in the early 1700s, the
first international bull market came to rise.  Kick-started by
infamous entities such as John Law’s Mississippi Company in
France and John Blunt’s South Sea Company in Britain, the
equity markets were whipped into a buying frenzy fueled
largely by duplicity. Both the Mississippi Company and South
Sea Company had convoluted structures and were heavily
marketed as pursuits to establish a presence and exploit trade
in the burgeoning Americas, even though they had only
marginal success in doing so. Both Blunt and Law used
elaborate and unproven financial engineering to advance the
price of their companies’ stocks at all costs.
Law’s scheme was particularly intricate and dangerous, as
it involved controlling France’s first central bank, in addition
to the Mississippi Company, which was the country’s largest
enterprise. Law won his way into a place of financial power in
France with promises to resolve the country’s financial woes,
which were dire: the government was on the verge of its third
bankruptcy in less than a century. Part of Law’s scheme
involved issuing shares in the Mississippi Company, the
proceeds of which were then used to pay down the national
debt. It depended on artificially inflating the share price of the
16

Mississippi Company, of which he was also the largest
shareholder. Such pressure and vast control allowed Law to
manipulate shareholders into believing the company’s
prospects were great. The company was in charge of setting up
colonies for trade in the Louisiana territory, which spanned the
equivalent of nearly a quarter of the present-day United States,
with New Orleans intended to be its centerpiece. To recruit
colonists to develop the area and lay the foundation of trade
that would lead to future profits for the company, he shared
“rosy visions of the colony as a veritable Garden of Eden,
inhabited by friendly savages, eager to furnish a cornucopia of
exotic goods for shipment to France.”
Law’s promises entranced investors and colonists alike, but
the dreams he spoke of were illusions, with no prospect of
near-term profits, and therefore little basis for the rising share
prices of the Mississippi Company. When the colonists arrived
in the Louisiana territory what they found “was a sweltering,
insect-infested swamp. Within a year 80 percent of them had
died of starvation or tropical diseases like yellow fever.”
Meanwhile, Law tinkered with other monetary policy
experiments to prop up the shares of his company and pay
down the national debt, such as doubling the supply of paper
money in France in a little over a year. Law grew his power to
the point where, “It was as if one man was simultaneously
running all five hundred of the top U.S. corporations, the U.S.
Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.”
JOHN LAW: CONVICTED MURDERER AND COMPULSIVE
GAMBLER
The French would have done well to better investigate the
17

priors of John Law before handing him control of the
country’s finances. If they had done proper due diligence,
they would have discovered he was a compulsive gambler
and convicted murderer. In the 1690s he had escaped from
prison in London—where he was awaiting a death
sentence—and fled to Amsterdam. At the time,
Amsterdam was a pioneer in new market structures, with
the trading of stock in the Dutch East India Company and
establishment of the world’s first central bank as gleaming
examples. Law studied these systems closely, which gave
him the knowledge necessary to pull off his elaborate
scheme in France.  The innovative investor would be
wise to learn from France’s mistake and always take the
time to investigate the priors of cryptoasset developers and
advisors before putting money into the assets they create.
Fortunately, today it’s quite easy to find information on
just about anyone through Google searches.
While Law duped French investors and government
officials for a few years, by the middle of 1720 it was clear his
financial engineering was unsustainable. Shareholder losses
were brutal, as the Mississippi Company would fall 90 percent
in value by the end of 1720, leading to public outrage and a
worsening of France’s financial woes. Law’s machinations
stunted France’s financial development for generations, as its
population remained gun-shy of paper money and stock
markets, thereby losing out on the positives that came with
responsible innovation in markets.
Law’s grand Mississippi Company was best described in a
cartoon that read:
18

This is the wondrous Mississippi land,
Made famous by its share dealings,
Which through deceit and devious conduct,
Has squandered countless treasures.
However men regard the shares,
It is wind and smoke and nothing more.
Misleading Cryptoassets
One of the most important actions innovative investors can
take to protect themselves from misleading characters is to do
their homework on the backgrounds of the main parties
involved in a cryptoasset, especially if it’s been newly issued.
If not much can be found about the specific characters
involved, that’s immediately a bad sign, as it means the
creators don’t want to be identified or held accountable for
what happens with that asset.
Next, investigate the materials the cryptoasset team
members have created. If their website, white paper, or other
materials are filled with typos, formatting mistakes, or
anything else that shows a lack of care, then take this also as a
warning. A team who doesn’t care enough to present
themselves well, likely doesn’t care if they mislead investors.
Many conversations and much information flow takes place
on Reddit, Twitter, in Slack Channels, and so on, not on the
well-manicured pages of tech and investing websites. The lack
of easily accessible information and standardization of
necessary information are weaknesses of the cryptoassets
space. It is the reason, after all, that you are reading this book.
THE FINE LINE BETWEEN MISLEADING AND A MISTAKE
Dash, a coin that rose to fame in late 2016 and early 2017
19

due to its stratospheric price increase, had what many
would call a misleading issuance. In the first 24 hours that
the coin went live, over 1.9 million dash were mined,
which was not part of the original plan. While Dash’s
founder supplied explanations—mainly that this was
caused by an inadvertent software bug—a concern many
still hold is that the Dash team misled new investors.  As
of March 2017, those first 24 hours still account for nearly
30 percent of the coins outstanding.
This is a situation in which the innovative investor must
discern the difference between a misleading issuer and an
honest mistake. We believe that Dash’s initial distribution
could have been corrected, just as its competing anonymity
cryptoasset, Monero, did, when it was forked off from
Bytecoin to solve for an unfair distribution of coins. The
Dash team could have relaunched to ensure a fair initial
distribution. That said, Dash has worked to overcome its
rocky beginning and at the start of April 2017 was one of
the top four cryptoassets in network value.  The asset is
backed by a few interesting innovations, and its team has
successfully navigated to a position of increasing
mainstream acceptance.
Misleading statements don’t even have to come from the
progenitors of cryptoassets; they can come from people who
claim to manage the assets for investors. We have seen many
deceptive investment offerings that purport to take investors’
money and place it into cryptoasset funds that will provide
“guaranteed” returns. For example, there’s a “Bitcoin Mutual
Fund” website that promises to provide 700 percent returns
over a range of periods, from 2 hours to 48 hours, depending
20
21

on the amount of money invested.  The website is full of
mistakes in spelling and grammar in the text, which provide
another red flag beyond the guaranteed returns. This is the
equivalent of Law’s Louisiana swampland.
CORNERING
Cornering a market refers to when one or more investors work
to drive the price of an asset up or down significantly. In the
cryptoasset space, they are frequently referred to as “pump and
dump” schemes, where loosely coordinated groups work to
pump up the price of a cryptoasset, exploiting crowd behavior,
before quickly selling to realize their profits. As with the other
examples in this chapter, cornering is nothing new in the
history of markets.
In 1869, Jay Gould, who was a prototype of the “Robber
Baron” and one of the most vilified men in nineteenth-century
America,  decided he wanted to corner the gold market.
Cornering the gold market was a particularly dangerous
proposition at the time, as gold remained the official currency
of international trade, and the value of gold in the United
States was largely dictated by the federal government.
When Ulysses S. Grant became president of the United
States in March 1869, the country was still dealing with the
ramifications of the Civil War that had ended four years
prior.  One of the biggest problems was the national debt the
country had accrued in fighting the war, which led many to
doubt the government’s credit worthiness. To re-instill faith,
one of the first actions Grant took was to sign a law that stated
the federal government would buy back U.S. bonds in “gold or
22
23
24
25

its equivalent.”  If the government were to buy bonds with
gold, the supply of gold in the market would increase,
meaning that the price of gold would decrease. Gold quickly
fell to $130 an ounce, its lowest point since 1862.
Gold has been valued by civilizations over hundreds of
centuries, and for a savvy investor, a drop in price typically
signifies a time to buy. Gould was not satisfied, however, with
buying gold and holding it patiently until he could sell at a
higher price and make an earnest profit. He had an ulterior
motive for driving gold up. He believed it would cause
currency devaluation, which would create an export boom that
would benefit the Erie Railroad,  a company in which he was
intimately involved. Furthermore, there was the clear
opportunity to benefit from buying low and selling high.
Knowing that the federal government could control the
price of gold with its open market operations, Gould devised a
plan to convince Grant, and thereby the federal government,
not to sell the gold it intended to. Since the federal gold
reserves were north of $100 million, which was greater than
the amount of gold in circulation, Gould rightly realized that
controlling the federal government meant controlling the price
of gold in U.S. markets.  If he could convince the
government not to sell its gold, then there would be less
supply in the market, thereby driving the price up. The price
would go up even more if Gould could freely buy it without
having to worry about a government dump.
Gould found the pawn he needed in Abel Corbin, who was
involved in politics and was married to Grant’s sister, Jennie.
Gould befriended Corbin, and with the extra persuasion of a
bribe, captured the ally he needed to sway the government’s
26
27
28
29

open market operations. Corbin first used his political
influence to appoint General Daniel Butterfield to the post of
U.S. sub-Treasurer in New York. Butterfield was instructed to
alert Corbin to any government gold sales in advance, which
would protect Gould from being surprised by any government
actions.  Both Corbin and Butterfield were promised $1.5
million stakes in the scheme, aligning their interests with
Gould’s.
More important than Butterfield, through the summer of
1869 Corbin worked his way into the president’s confidence
with the singular goal of convincing him to cease selling gold.
Corbin also succeeded in getting Gould and Grant to converse
at social gatherings, allowing Gould to provide his convoluted
rationale that a rising gold price would be for the nation’s
benefit.  Corbin eventually succeeded, getting word from
Grant on September 2 that he planned to stop gold sales for the
month.
Gould had been stockpiling gold throughout August in
anticipation of this favorable verdict, and upon receiving the
news, he kicked it into overdrive. He enlisted a wealthy ally,
Jay Fisk, with whom he had pulled off other illegal market
feats. With the added funds of Fisk, Gould pumped even more
money into the gold market, driving up the price.
In mid-September, however, the cabal overplayed its hand.
They first tried to bribe the president’s private secretary, and
when that failed Corbin wrote a letter to Grant, checking to see
if the president planned to continue with his strategy of not
selling gold through the month. Upon getting the letter on
September 19, Grant became suspicious of foul play and
instructed his wife to write to Mrs. Corbin to convince her
30
31
32
33
34

husband to steer clear of the ruse.
Unsurprisingly, Mr. Corbin was dismayed that Grant was
catching on to the plot. Upon learning of the situation, Gould
knew he could no longer depend on Grant to hold the nation’s
gold. Under the cover of Fisk’s continued buying, Gould
started unloading the gold he had acquired.
While the Gold Exchange had been rising continuously
throughout September, on September 24, 1869, it peaked and
would go down as “Jay Gould’s Black Friday.” Gould had
employed a dozen brokers to continue quietly selling his gold,
while his partner Fisk pushed the gold market to $160, a 20
percent rise from its bottom earlier in the year. Shortly
thereafter, Butterfield’s broker started selling gold, which
alerted those at the exchange that the federal government was
likely on its way to a sale. Sure enough, an hour after gold hit
$160, an order came in from the federal government to sell $4
million of gold. While Gould and Fisk quietly slipped out of
the exchange, panic ensued, as detailed by Chancellor: “The
rapid fluctuations bankrupted thousands of margin holders,
mobs formed in Broad Street and outside Gould’s brokerage
office, and troops were put on alert to enter the financial
district.”
As with most panics, the contagion spread from the Gold
Exchange. Because of Gould’s cornering of the market, stock
prices dropped 20 percent, a variety of agricultural exports fell
50 percent in value, and the national economy was disrupted
for several months.  Gould exited with a cool $11 million
profit from the debacle, and scot-free from legal charges.  It
is all too common that characters like Gould escape unscathed
by the havoc they create, which then allows them to carry on
35
36
37
38

with their machinations in other markets.
In the cryptoasset markets, characters toying with asset
prices can often obfuscate their identity through the veil of the
Internet, which unfortunately makes it even easier for them to
escape. Often, they will target small and relatively unknown
assets, which makes it important for the innovative investor
who ventures into these smaller markets to pay particular
attention to the details of those assets and the characters
associated with them.
Beyond the Gold Exchange in 1869, examples of the
cornering of commodities markets have continued to surface.
In 1980, the Hunt brothers, who had been left billions by their
wealthy oil-mogul father, attempted to corner the silver
market. With inflation levels starting the year off at 14
percent, one of the highest levels on record,  the brothers
believed silver would become a haven against inflation the
way gold was, and they intended to own as much of it as they
possibly could. Using the commodities markets and leverage,
the brothers rapidly amassed $4.5 billion worth of silver
(much of it being flown to Switzerland in specially designed
planes under armed guard),  pushing the price to nearly $50
per ounce. Ultimately, the U.S. government had to step in to
prevent further manipulation, which ultimately ruined the
brothers’ ploy and fortunes, as silver dropped back to $11 per
ounce on March 27, 1980.
Other notable instances of cornering markets reveal that
this vulnerability spans asset classes:
•   In 1929 over a hundred companies listed on the NYSE
were cornered.
•   From April 1987 to March 1989, the Tokyo Stock
39
40
41
42

Exchange estimated that one out of every 10 companies
listed on its exchange was cornered.
•   In the middle of 1991, Salomon Brothers was caught
trying to manipulate U.S. Treasuries, widely regarded as
one of the safest investment instruments in the world.
•   In the mid-1990s, Yasuo Hamanaka pushed the cost of
copper on the London Metals Exchange up by over 75
percent to $3,200 and was rewarded with a seven-year
prison sentence.
Pumping, Dumping, and Cornering Cryptoassets
Cryptoassets that have small network values are particularly
susceptible to the cornering of their markets. For example, at
the start of April 2017, the 200 smallest cryptoassets had
markets of less than $20,000. Therefore, a bad actor could
come in with $10,000 and buy up half the assets outstanding.
This increased buying pressure will drive up the price of the
asset, which tends to draw curiosity from others. If several
speculators are in collusion, then they will work together to
drive up the price of these small cryptoassets, while spreading
hype on different social media platforms (a tweet or two from
an “influencer” is enough).
The intent is to lure unknowing speculators to take the bait
and buy the asset based on what they think is genuine market
interest. The innovative investor who does due diligence
would never buy solely based on market interest, and for good
reason. The colluders will slowly work to exit their positions,
while the inertia of enthusiasm leads more unknowing
speculators to continue buying, as we saw with Gould. These
pump-and-dumps, or P&Ds, are unfortunately becoming
43
44

common in the smaller cryptoassets.
Cornering is also important to consider in crowdsales,
especially if the founding team has given itself a significant
chunk of the assets. While crowdsales will be further detailed
in Chapter 16, the key takeaway for now is that if the founding
team gives themselves too much of the assets outstanding,
then they have immense power over the market price of the
cryptoasset and this is potentially concerning.
Control over the asset supply goes beyond crowdsales and
founders, as it can spread to the miners or other entities
required to support a cryptoasset. This is where it becomes
important to consider the monetary policy of a cryptoasset. For
example, one of the concerns with Dash is that it created a
supply structure prone to cornering. In addition to miners, in
Dash there are entities called masternodes, which are also
controlled by people or groups of people. Masternodes play an
integral role in performing near instant and anonymous
transactions with Dash. However, as a security mechanism, the
entity has to bond at least 1,000 dash to be a masternode.
Bond is a fancy word for hold, but it’s a term commonly used
in the cryptoasset space to imply that those assets can’t move.
If the masternode moves those bonded dash, and subsequently
holds less than 1,000 dash, then that person or group can no
longer be a masternode.
Given that there were over 4,000 masternodes in March
2017, that means 4 million dash were bonded, or illiquid. With
just over 7 million dash available on the market, that 4 million
means that roughly 60 percent of the supply is unavailable.
Add to that the nearly 2 million dash that were instamined in
the first 24 hours, and it implies that 6 million of the 7 million
45

dash available are likely under the control of power players in
the space, leaving only 15 percent of the remaining dash in
free-floating markets.
The situation is arguably only worsening, as masternodes
receive 45 percent of each block reward, which means that of
the new supply of dash, they are receiving almost 50 percent.
Since they already own 60 percent of the supply outstanding,
this gives the masternodes significant ability, and since they
hold lots of dash, incentive, to corner the market.
The innovative investor needs to carefully examine the
supply schedules and who newly minted cryptoassets are
being issued to. Fortunately, once the blockchain is live,
because it’s a distributed and transparent ledger, it’s easy to
see address balances. Often there are sites that will show the
amount held by the top addresses, such as the Bitcoin Rich
List.  For Bitcoin, two addresses hold between them 227,618
bitcoin, or roughly 1.4 percent of the total outstanding.
Another 116 addresses hold a total of 2.87 million bitcoin, or
19 percent of the total outstanding, which is sizeable. Unlike
dash, however, these holders aren’t necessarily receiving
nearly half of the newly minted bitcoin, and so their ability to
push the price upward is less. Lastly, it should be noted that a
single person can have multiple bitcoin addresses, so each
address is not necessarily a distinct entity.
• • •
In closing, there are many tricks of the trade, whether it be
mass speculation, misleading asset issuers, Ponzi finance, or
cornering, with much of it justified by “this time is different”
thinking. However, these are not new tricks—they have
existed for centuries and in all asset classes. The best way for
46

innovative investors to avoid these traps when considering
cryptoassets for their portfolio is to perform proper due
diligence on the fundamentals and ignore the whims of the
crowd. Understanding which fundamentals are most important
for long-term growth takes us to the next chapter on a
framework for investigating cryptoassets.

Part III
HOW

W
Chapter 12
Fundamental Analysis and a
Valuation Framework for
Cryptoassets
ith an awareness of the many tricks that can be played on
investors in emerging markets, it’s time to develop a
framework for innovative investors to evaluate a cryptoasset
for their portfolio. Each cryptoasset is different, as are the
goals, objectives, and risk profiles of each investor. Therefore,
while this chapter will provide a starting point, it is by no
means comprehensive. It’s also not investment advice. Since
this space is moving at light speed, our intent is not to say,
“Buy this, sell that.” Remember, in the process of writing this
book, we watched the aggregate network value of cryptoassets
jump from approximately $10 billion to north of $100 billion
and hundreds of new cryptoassets come to market.
Investors need to judge for themselves what to do. Our goal
is to provide a basis for what to look for when first
investigating cryptoassets. Then, using knowledge from
chapters past, how to begin contemplating whether a specific
cryptoasset fits their risk-profile and overall investment
1

strategy and if it will help them achieve their financial goals
and objectives.
In Chapter 15, we discuss investment products that take the
bulk of operational weight off the investor. If someone wants
exposure to this new asset class but doesn’t want his or her
fingers in the wires all the time, a growing number of
investment options are becoming available, like cryptoasset
managers and publicly traded vehicles like the Bitcoin
Investment Trust. Even with those products, innovative
investors will need to know enough to ask the right questions
and be assured that the vehicle they’ve put their hard-earned
money into is an appropriate investment.
Fortunately, many of the same tools for assessing any
investment can be used for individual cryptoassets as well.
Fundamental analysis will reveal if an investment is worthy of
long-term capital allocation, while technical analysis will
assist with the timing of buys and sells. Much has been written
about these two schools of investing thought, and they’re often
pitched as being diametrically opposed.  We believe they can
be used together, especially if innovative investors want to be
actively involved in their portfolios.
Fundamental analysis involves looking at the intrinsic value
drivers of an asset. For example, with stocks, fundamental
analysis involves the evaluation of a company’s operating
health through close examination of its income statement,
balance sheet, and cash flow statement, while placing these
factors in the context of its long-term vision and
macroeconomic exposure. Metrics like price to earnings, price
to sales, book value, and return on equity are derived through
fundamental analysis to determine the value of a company and
2

compare it with its peers.
Fundamental analysis can be a time-consuming process that
requires access to the latest data not only for a company but
also as it relates to an industry and the economy overall. Many
times, an investor and even a financial advisor will depend on
analysts to crunch these numbers to provide insights into
relevant assets. In the traditional capital markets, an entire
industry is based on this process, known as sell-side research.
Currently, there is no such thing as sell-side research for
cryptoassets, and this will require innovative investors to scour
through the details on their own or rely on recognized thought
leaders in the space. We’ll do our best to arm investors with
the resources to do this analysis so they aren’t scared away
from the effort.
As it pertains to evaluating cryptoassets, the process of
conducting fundamental analysis is different from stocks
because cryptoassets are not companies. The assets may have
been created by a company or group of individuals, and an
understanding of that company or those individuals is vital,
but the cryptoassets themselves should be valued more as
commodities, with markets priced by the balance of supply
and demand.
In this chapter we discuss applying fundamental analysis to
the founding characteristics of a cryptoasset. This includes
examining:
•   White paper
•   Decentralization edge
•   Valuation
•   Community and developers

•   Relation to digital siblings
•   Issuance model
In the next chapter, we focus on applying fundamental
analysis to the ongoing network health of these assets,
including metrics on miners, developers, companies, and
users. Together, these foundational and network fundamentals
generate a unique fundamental analysis approach to
cryptoassets that will help the innovative investor make well-
informed investment decisions. We’ll round out these
framework chapters by including an examination of how
technical analysis can be used for further benefit, specifically
to identify appropriate times to invest or liquidate.
WHERE TO START: THE WHITE PAPER
Since cryptoassets are supported by open-source code, with
transparent and accessible communities, there is typically an
abundance of information available on an asset. Any
cryptoasset worth its mustard has an origination white paper.
A white paper is a document that’s often used in business to
outline a proposal, typically written by a thought leader or
someone knowledgeable on a topic. As it relates to
cryptoassets, a white paper is the stake in the ground, outlining
the problem the asset addresses, where the asset stands in the
competitive landscape, and what the technical details are.
Satoshi outlined Bitcoin in his white paper, and since then
most creators of cryptoassets have followed the same process.
Some of these white papers can be highly technical, though at
the very least, perusing the introduction and conclusion is
valuable. White papers can often be found on the website

created for the cryptoasset.
VAGUENESS IS NOT YOUR FRIEND
A cryptoasset white paper may include a lot of technical
information and be difficult to read all the way through.
Many times, the team developing the cryptoasset will have
a website that has a brief description of what the asset
intends to do and how it intends to do it. Even if not
everything described is understood, if the description lacks
specificity and seems intentionally vague, that may be a
sign to avoid the asset. Investors should feel comfortable
briefly explaining the asset in some manner to a friend
who may or may not be knowledgeable on the subject. If
the investor can’t do that, it may be appropriate to consider
a different cryptoasset.
DECENTRALIZATION EDGE
When reading the white paper, the first question to ask is:
What problem does it solve? In other words, is there a reason
for this cryptoasset and its associated architecture to exist in a
decentralized manner? There are lots of digital services in our
world, so does this one have an inherent benefit to being
provisioned in a distributed, secure, and egalitarian manner?
We call this the decentralization edge. Put bluntly by Vitalik
Buterin, “Projects really should make sure they have good
answers for ‘why use a blockchain.’”
A number of cryptoasset-based projects focus on social
networks, such as Steemit  and Yours,  the latter of which
uses litecoin. While we admire these projects, we also ask:
3
4
5

Will these networks and their associated assets gain traction
with competitors like Reddit and Facebook? Similarly, a
cryptoasset service called Swarm City  (formerly Arcade City)
aims to decentralize Uber, which is already a highly efficient
service. What edge will the decentralized Swarm City have
over the centralized Uber?
In the case of Steemit and Yours, we understand content
creators will get directly compensated. This may draw more
quality content to the platform, which will thereby drive more
use. In the case of Swarm City, the drivers won’t be losing 20
to 30 percent of every fare to a centralized service, so over
time, more drivers may come to the platform. As more drivers
come to the platform, there may be increased availability of
Swarm City cars, and therefore the service may be more
beneficial to the end user. Just as with Steemit and Yours, a
greater volume of providers and consumers increases the value
of the platform over time.
However, are these factors enough to gain traction over
Reddit, Facebook, and Uber over the long term? The
innovative investor should perform similar thought
experiments with any cryptoasset under consideration and be
convinced that its associated architecture will provide long-
term value and isn’t simply riding a hype-wave  with the
intent of gaining funding while providing little value over
time.
THE POWER OF AGE: THE LINDY EFFECT
The Lindy effect is often used to gauge the potential life
expectancy of technologies. Unlike humans, where the
longer someone lives, the more likely that death is
6
7

approaching, the longer technologies live, the less likely
they are to die soon. The reason is that technologies build
momentum, and over time many other technologies are
built around them, which continues to drive underlying
support. The most important technologies become
intractable to our daily lives, or at least sticky on a decadal
scale. Even culturally, it will take time for the technology
to fade deep into obsolescence.
The same applies to cryptoassets. The longest-lived
cryptoasset, bitcoin, now has an entire ecosystem of
hardware, software developers, companies, and users built
around it. Essentially, it has created its own economy, and
while a superior cryptocurrency could slowly gain share, it
would have an uphill battle given the foothold bitcoin has
gained.
On the other hand, a newly launched cryptoasset is little
known, making the community supporting it much more
fragile. If a major flaw is exposed, or the cryptoasset
undergoes some other form of duress, the community may
quickly disperse. Many members may move to support
other cryptoassets, while others may try again, launching a
slightly altered cryptoasset, applying the lessons learned.
In other words, with a new cryptoasset there is much less
sunk cost, which makes it easier for people to let go and
move on to something else. For a great example of how
quickly a new cryptoasset can rise and fall, recall what
happened with The DAO.
However, if a cryptoasset has strong community
engagement and achieves success early on, it can create a
solid foothold that can benefit it over time. Ethereum

seems to be a good example. The demise of The DAO
significantly impacted Ethereum (which The DAO was
built on), but through leadership and community
involvement, the major issues were addressed, and as of
April 2017 Ethereum stands solidly as the second largest
cryptoasset in terms of network value.
UNDERSTANDING A CRYPTOASSET’S
VALUATION
One of the most common questions is: What gives a
cryptoasset value? After all, these assets have no physical
manifestation. Since they are born of software, the value is
derived from the community and the marketplace that
naturally develops around the asset. Broadly, there are two
kinds of value that the community places on any kind of
cryptoasset: utility value and speculative value.
Utility Value and Speculative Value
Utility value refers to the use of the cryptoasset to gain access
to the digital resource its architecture provisions and is
dictated by supply and demand characteristics. For bitcoin, its
utility is that it can safely, quickly, and efficiently transfer
value to anyone, anywhere in the world. All it takes is typing
in the person’s bitcoin address and clicking send, a
functionality that all exchanges and wallets provide (which we
cover in Chapter 14). Bitcoin’s utility in sending value using
the Internet is similar to that of Skype, which can safely,
quickly, and efficiently transmit anyone’s voice and image to
anyone, anywhere in the world.
8

The innovative investor might say: “OK, I understand that
bitcoin can have utility as MoIP, just as Skype has utility as
VoIP, but how does that translate to bitcoin being worth
$1,000 a coin?” Bitcoin’s utility value can be determined by
assessing how much bitcoin is necessary for it to serve the
Internet economy it supports. To conceptually understand how
bitcoin has value, we will use a couple of simplified examples.
From there the innovative investor can use this scaffolding to
dive deeper into valuations.
Let’s start with a hypothetical Brazilian merchant who
wants to buy US$100,000 worth of steel from a Chinese
manufacturer. While this particular merchant is hypothetical,
adoption of bitcoin by Latin American merchants has been
well documented.  The merchant wants to use bitcoin because
it will allow her to transfer that money within an hour as
opposed to waiting a week or more. Therefore, the Brazilian
merchant buys US$100,000 worth of bitcoin and sends it to
the Chinese manufacturer. While the manufacturer is waiting
for that transaction to be incorporated into Bitcoin’s
blockchain, that bitcoin is frozen, temporarily drawn out of the
available supply of bitcoin.
Now imagine there are 99,999 other merchants wanting to
do the same thing. In total, among all these merchants, there is
demand for US$10 billion worth of bitcoin (100,000 people
wanting to send US$100,000 each), simply because it is more
expedient at moving money between Brazil and China than
other available payment methods. US$10 billion worth of
demand with bitcoin trading at $1,000 converts to 10 million
coins being temporarily frozen or drawn out of the available
supply of bitcoin.
9

But consider that a significant amount of bitcoin is also
being held by investors. Those investors do not plan to sell
their bitcoin for some time because they are speculating that
due to its utility as MoIP, demand will continue to rise and so
too will its value. Currently, roughly 5.5 million bitcoin, or
US$5.5 billion worth at the price of US$1,000 per coin, is held
by the top 1,000 addresses recorded in Bitcoin’s blockchain.
That means on average each of these addresses is holding
US$5.5 million worth of bitcoin, and it’s fair to assume that
these balances are not those of merchants waiting for their
transactions to complete. Instead, these are likely balances of
bitcoin that entities are holding for the long term based on
what they think bitcoin’s future utility value will be. Future
utility value can be thought of as speculative value, and for
this speculative value investors are keeping 5.5 million bitcoin
out of the supply.
At the start of April 2017, there were just over 16 million
bitcoin outstanding. Between international merchants needing
10 million bitcoin, and 5.5 million bitcoin held by the top
1,000 investors, there are only roughly 500,000 bitcoin free for
people to use. A market naturally develops for these bitcoin
because maybe another investor wants to buy-and-hold 5
bitcoin, or a merchant wants to send US$100,000 of bitcoin to
Mexico. Since these people must buy that bitcoin from
someone else, that someone else needs to be convinced to let
that bitcoin go, and so a negotiation begins. On a broader
scale, all these negotiations occur on exchanges around the
world, and a market to value bitcoin is made.
If demand continues to go up for bitcoin, then with a
disinflationary supply schedule, so too will its price (or
10

velocity). However, at a certain point some investors may
choose to exit their investments because they feel that bitcoin
has reached its maximum value. In other words, those
investors no longer feel bitcoin has any speculative value left,
and instead its price is only supported by current utility value.
With only utility value left, then there is no reason for the
investor to continue to hold the asset as it has reached its
maximum potential and is unlikely to appreciate any further.
To perform the calculation that may lead an investor to believe
bitcoin’s maximum value has been reached, we need to
introduce two more concepts: the velocity of money and
discounting.
Velocity in the Context of Valuation
The concept of velocity is a necessary tool in understanding
the opportunity that exists for bitcoin’s value to increase as it
fills more needs around the world. Velocity is used to explain
the turnover of fiat currencies, and is described succinctly by
the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis:
The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is
used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given
time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to
buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is
increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an
economy.
The velocity of a currency is calculated by dividing the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) for a certain period by the total
money supply. For example, if the GDP is $20 trillion, but
there are only $5 trillion worth of dollars available, then that
money needs to turn over four times, or have a velocity of
four, in order to meet demand on any given year. Currently,
11

the velocity of the USD is a little north of 5.
For bitcoin, instead of looking at the “domestically
produced goods and services” it will purchase in a period, the
innovative investor must look at the internationally produced
goods and services it will purchase. The global remittances
market—currently dominated by companies that provide the
ability for people to send money to one another internationally
—is an easily graspable example of a service within which
bitcoin could be used.
About US$500 billion is transmitted annually through the
remittances market. Assuming that bitcoin serviced that entire
market, then to figure out the value of one bitcoin, one would
need to assume its velocity. Say bitcoin’s velocity is 5, similar
to that of the U.S. dollar. Then dividing that $500 billion by a
velocity of 5 would yield a total value of bitcoin of $100
billion. If, at this point, we are at the maximum of 21 million
bitcoin, and this is the only use for bitcoin, then that $100
billion divided by 21 million units would yield a value per
bitcoin of $4,762.
Clearly, this is an overly simplistic example because bitcoin
will not service the entire remittances market. Instead, there
needs to be an assumption about the percentage of the
remittance market that bitcoin will service. Let’s assume it
will service 20 percent, and so each bitcoin will need to store
$952 dollars to meet its demand within the remittance market
described ($952 = $4,762 × 20%).
Importantly, the use cases for bitcoin are additive, as are the
values demanded. For example, the global financial gold
market is worth US$2.4 trillion,  so if bitcoin were to take a
10 percent share of that market it would need to store a total
12
13

value of US$240 billion. Now, holding bitcoin as digital gold
has a velocity of 1 because it’s not turning over: it’s just being
held each year. In other words, there’s no need to divide the
value that must be stored by velocity as we had to do with
remittances. Thus, at a steady state with 21 million units of
bitcoin outstanding, each unit of bitcoin would need to store
$11,430 worth of value to meet the demand of 10 percent of
the investable gold market ($11,430 = $240B / 21M).
If each bitcoin needs to be worth $952 to service 20 percent
of the remittance market and $11,430 to service the demand
for it as digital gold, then in total it needs to be worth $12,382.
There is no limit to the number of use cases that can be added
in this process, but what is extremely tricky is figuring out the
percent share of the market that bitcoin will ultimately fulfill
and what the velocity of bitcoin will be in each use case.
Also, note that in this example we used the assumption of a
steady state bitcoin supply at 21 million units, which will not
be reached until 2140. When trying to piece together the
fundamental value of the cryptoasset, it is important to
consider the time frame and the units of that cryptoasset that
will be available by that time, as some assets can have
extremely high rates of inflation initially.
Discounting in the Context of Valuation
The next concept necessary for determining the present value
of one bitcoin is discounting future values back to the present.
For example, if you deposit $100 in a bank account that yields
a 5 percent compounded annual rate, then in one year you will
have $105. In two years, you will have $110.25 because you
earn 5 percent on your $105. Therefore, you either want $100

now or $110.25 in two years—both are worth the same to you.
Analysts use the discounting method to figure out how
much they should pay for something now if it is expected to be
worth more in the future. Discounting is simply the reverse of
accruing interest. For example, in this example, if $110.25 is
divided by 1.05 once, and then divided by it again it will yield
$100. In other words, $110.25 is divided by (1.05)  to get back
to $100, as opposed to multiplying $100 by (1.05)  to get to
$110.25. Such a method can be applied to much longer periods
as well. For example, if someone offered to give the
innovative investor $150 in 10 years or $100 now, then if there
was a perfectly safe way to earn 5 percent the innovative
investor should take the $100 now because $150 divided by
(1.05 ) equals $92 today.
Taking the concepts of supply and demand, velocity, and
discounting, we can figure out what bitcoin’s value should be
today, assuming it is to serve certain utility purposes 10 years
from now. However, this is much easier said than done, as it
involves figuring out the sizes of those markets in the future,
the percent share that bitcoin will take, what bitcoin’s velocity
will be, and what an appropriate discount rate is. The discount
rate should be a function of risk, which often for cryptoassets
is 30 percent or more. This is more than double what common
discount rates are for risky stocks.
If we take the hypothetical value of bitcoin as $12,382, and
assume it will reach that utility value in 10 years, then with a
discount rate of 30 percent that means the present value of
each bitcoin is worth $898 per bitcoin [$898 = $12,380 /
(1.3 )]. Hence, at a current price of $1,000 per bitcoin, the
asset would be overvalued because investors are paying too
2
2
10
14
10

much for it at $1,000 when it really should only be worth $898
given future expectations.
Now, this model has many assumptions and flaws, and a
common refrain for such models is “Garbage in, garbage
out.” For example, we give only two potential use cases, we
had no justification for the percent market share bitcoin would
take, and to derive the original price of $12,382 we made the
assumption that 21 million bitcoin would be available. In
reality, we will be roughly 95 percent of the way to 21 million
bitcoin outstanding in ten years, again highlighting the
importance of considering the future supply of a cryptoasset
when digging into fundamental values. It is easy to manipulate
models to show that an asset is under-or overvalued, but these
models are nonetheless useful to give investors some bearing
on what they are paying for.
For even the most diligent innovative investor, valuing
prospective cryptoassets is not a palatable task. However, just
as there exists a big business in selling valuation research on
stocks, so too will there be a business for valuing cryptoassets.
Already there have been reports, such as those from Spencer
Bogart at Needham & Company, as well as Gil Luria at
Wedbush, that look at the fundamental value of bitcoin. Figure
12.1 shows a fundamental valuation report that Gil put
together on bitcoin in July 2015 to give some idea of how
complex these models can become.

Figure 12.1 
 A fundamental valuation of bitcoin over 10 years (Source: Gil Luria,
Director of Research at D.A. Davidson & Co.)
The valuations these analysts produce can be useful guides

for the innovative investor, but they should not be considered
absolute dictations of the truth. Remember, “Garbage in,
garbage out.” We suspect that as opposed to these reports
remaining proprietary, as is currently the case with much of
the research on equities and bonds, many of these reports will
become open-source and widely accessible to all levels of
investors in line with the ethos of cryptoassets.
GET TO KNOW THE COMMUNITY AND
THE DEVELOPERS
After a valuation analysis is done, or at the very least current
value is contemplated, the best thing the innovative investor
can do is to know and understand the cryptoasset developers
and surrounding community. As peer-to-peer technologies, all
cryptoassets have social networks. Reddit, Twitter, and Slack
groups are valuable information channels, though we hesitate
to give more guidance than that as each community is
different, and communication channels are always changing.
Another extremely valuable and often underappreciated or
unknown resource is Meetup.com groups.
In getting to know the community better, consider a few
key points. How committed is the developer team, and what is
their background? Have they worked on a previous cryptoasset
and in that process refined their ideas so that they now want to
launch another? For example, this could be similar to what
happened with Vitalik Buterin in his decision to move on from
Bitcoin and start Ethereum, which was something
fundamentally new. Or is there something more sinister going
on? If any of the developers have a questionable track record,

especially concerning involvement in the fishy launch of past
cryptoassets, then exercise extreme caution. Remember John
Law. Information about the core members behind a
cryptoasset can be found through Google searches, LinkedIn,
and Twitter, as well as by spending time on the forums related
to these assets (they’re good for at least a chuckle or two as
well). If information cannot be found on the developers, or the
developers are overtly anonymous, then this is a red flag
because there is no accountability if things go wrong.
RELATION TO DIGITAL SIBLINGS
Next, the innovative investor should ask: How is the
cryptoasset related to its ancestors? Is it a fork of another coin?
If so, what aspects are being changed, and why do those
changes justify an entirely new asset? A frequent argument
that Bitcoin Maximalists—people who believe bitcoin will be
the only cryptoasset that survives—purport is that all other
cryptoassets display features that Bitcoin will someday absorb.
There is some merit to this point, as Bitcoin’s open-source
roots make it flexible, but it is by no means a view we ascribe
to. We do, however, encourage innovative investors to put
their Bitcoin Maximalist thinking cap on every time they’re
investigating a new cryptoasset, as it forces important
questions to be asked.
We expect to see an increasing number of cryptoassets that
are built on the platform of another asset, which is an
important consideration in the arena of digital siblings. As we
covered in Chapter 5, Ethereum, which we defined as a
cryptocommodity, is a common platform for dApps and their

associated cryptotokens. Whether this relation is for better or
worse depends on the situation. In the DAOsaster, The DAO
had a significantly negative impact on Ethereum. On the other
hand, the successful creation and implementation of
cryptotokens like Augur or SingularDTV, which are also built
on Ethereum, can have a positive impact on all assets
involved. As Ethereum grows as a platform for other
cryptoassets, it will be important to keep an eye on the quality
of the dApps that are built on it, and how the Ethereum team
handles its relationship with these dApps. If Ethereum gets big
enough, there may eventually be those who call themselves
Ethereum Maximalists!
ISSUANCE MODEL
The current and ongoing rate of supply increase is extremely
important to consider. If a cryptoasset has a high rate of supply
issuance, as bitcoin did in its early days, then that can erode
the asset’s value if its utility isn’t growing in line with
expectations. The total planned supply of the asset is also
integral to the cryptoasset’s individual units preserving value
over time. If too many units will ultimately be issued, that will
erode the value of the asset in the future.
Next, consider if the distribution is fair. Remember that a
premine (where the assets are mined before the network is
made widely available, as was the case with bytecoin) or an
instamine (where many of the assets are mined at the start, as
was the case with dash) are both bad signs because assets and
power will accrue to a few, as opposed to being widely
distributed in line with the egalitarian ethos.

As much as these comments about premines and instamines
can sound black and white, the reality is there may be
appropriate reasons for different issuance models. Issuance
models are evolving as developers sort through the
cryptoeconomics of releasing cryptoassets to support
decentralized networks. As with central banks and traditional
economics, people are feeling their way toward what works.
Furthermore, the issuance model of cryptoassets is always
subject to change. For example, Ethereum started with one
planned issuance model, but is deciding to go with another a
couple years into launch.  Such changes in the issuance
model may occur for other assets, or impact those assets that
are significantly tied to the Ethereum network.
While we have covered a few issuance models in detail,
like those of Bitcoin and Monero, the most important aspect is
that the issuance model fits the use case. With Dogecoin we
saw that it needed lots of units outstanding for it to function as
a tipping service, which justifies it currently having over 100
billion units outstanding, a significantly larger amount than
Bitcoin. With many people turning to bitcoin as gold 2.0, an
issuance model like Dogecoin’s would be a terrible idea.
• • •
The next avenue to pursue information often depends on the
maturity of the cryptoasset. For Bitcoin, more than eight years
worth of conversation and writing on the trials and tribulations
of the asset exist, plus constant improvements to its underlying
code. For Ethereum, there’s clearly less information, as it was
announced five years after Bitcoin’s network had been up and
running. Many cryptoassets, especially in the cryptotoken
vertical, are even newer than Ethereum.
15

The creation of new cryptoassets is occurring at an
increasing, some would say alarming, pace. New releases are
the ones that require the most due diligence. We caution all
but the most experienced innovative investors to venture into
these riskier assets. We have dedicated an entire chapter,
Chapter 16, to the history and investigation of cryptoassets
being launched in 2017 and beyond.
In the next chapter, we will investigate the network health
of cryptoassets, which can also be thought of as operating
fundamentals. Operating fundamentals are the metrics that
show a cryptoasset with a functioning architecture is gaining
traction and fulfilling its potential. Since these fundamentals
can also influence the price, we will conclude the chapter with
a discussion of market technicals to identify the best
opportunities to buy, sell, or trade a cryptoasset.

A
Chapter 13
Operating Health of
Cryptoasset Networks and
Technical Analysis
cryptoasset that is already operating provides a wealth of
information, which can be used to build upon the foundational
information we discussed in the last chapter. Such information
leads us deep into the operational fundamentals: those aspects
of a cryptoasset that reveal how it is working day-to-day and
year-to-year in the real world.
Recall how we first described blockchain architecture as a
stack of hardware, software, applications, and users. Specific
metrics can be investigated from each of these four layers that
will reveal the ongoing growth of an operating cryptoasset, or
lack thereof. For a healthy and thriving asset, the one universal
law is that these metrics should be growing. If a cryptoasset is
in its early days and it’s not growing, then its future is likely
not going to be bright.
We describe in detail the operating fundamentals for each
of the four layers. We close off the chapter with a practical
discussion of technical analysis and how the innovative

investor can use these tools to help the timing of both
cryptoasset purchases and sales.
MINERS
One of the most important, but often overlooked, indicators of
a cryptoasset’s ongoing health is the support of the underlying
security system. For proof-of-work based systems, such as
Bitcoin, Ethereum,  Litecoin, Monero, and many more,
security is a function of the number of miners and their
combined compute (or hashing) power.
Since miners are the ones validating transactions and
building the asset’s blockchain, their combined compute
power needs to be robust enough to fend off attackers that
want to trick the network into processing invalid transactions.
The only way attackers can process invalid transactions is if
they own over half of the compute power of the network, so
it’s critical that no single entity ever exceeds 50 percent
ownership. If they do, then they can perform what’s referred to
as a 51 percent attack, in which they process invalid
transactions. This involves spending money they don’t have
and would ruin confidence in the cryptoasset. The best way to
prevent this attack from happening is to have so many
computers supporting the blockchain in a globally
decentralized topography that no single entity could hope to
buy enough computers to take majority share.
Buying and maintaining these computers is costly, and
miners are not volunteering their time and money out of
altruism. Instead, more computers are only added to the
network when more entities see the ability to profit from doing
1

so. In other words, miners are purely economically rational
individuals—mercenaries of compute power—and their profit
is largely driven by the value of the cryptoasset as well as by
transaction fees. Therefore, the more the price goes up, and the
more transactions are processed, the more likely new
computers will be added to help support and secure the
network.  In turn, the greater hardware support there is for the
network, the more people will trust in its security, thereby
driving more people to buy and use the asset.
A clearly positively reinforcing cycle sets in that ensures
that the larger the asset grows, the more secure it becomes—as
it should be. The security should be different for a pawn shop
with $3,000 in the cash register versus a Wells Fargo branch
with $2 million in the vault. The same goes for the security of
a cryptoasset with a network value of $300,000 versus $3
billion.
Hash Rates as a Sign of Security
One way to determine the relative safety of a cryptoasset is
through its hash rate. A cryptoasset’s hash rate is
representative of the combined power of the mining computers
connected to the network. For example, Figures 13.1 and 13.2
show Bitcoin’s hash rate and Ethereum’s hash rate over time,
both of which display hyper growth characteristics.
2

Figure 13.1  Bitcoin’s hash rate rise since inception
Data sourced from Blockchain.info
Figure 13.2 
 Ethereum’s hash rate rise since inception
Data sourced from Etherscan.io

As of March 2017, Bitcoin’s hash rate had increased 3-fold
over March 2016, while Ethereum’s hash rate had increased
10-fold. While Ethereum is experiencing faster growth, which
could be taken as a sign that more miners are enthusiastic
about their potential profits from supporting Ethereum, it is
also growing off a smaller initial hash rate than Bitcoin.
At the risk of being repetitive, more hash rate signifies
more computers are being added to support the network,
which signifies greater security. This typically only happens if
the value of the cryptoasset and its associated transactions are
increasing, because miners are profit-driven individuals. While
hash rate often follows price, sometimes price can follow hash
rate. This happens in situations where miners expect good
things of the asset in the future, and therefore proactively
connect machines to help secure the network. This instills
confidence, and perhaps the expected good news has also
traveled to the market, so the price starts going up.
Once it’s been ascertained that the hash rate is growing,
often the best way to compare the relative security of
cryptoassets is through a calculation of the equipment securing
the network. Using a dollar value is helpful because it gives us
an idea of how much a bad actor would have to spend to
recreate the network, which is what the actor would need to
launch a 51 percent attack.
As of March 2017, a Bitcoin mining machine that produced
14 terahash per second (TH/s) could be bought for $2,300. The
idea of TH/s can be thought of as similar to a personal
computer’s clock speed, which is often measured in gigahertz
(GHz), and similarly represents the number of times a machine
can execute instructions per second. It would take 286,000 of

the aforementioned 14 TH/s machines to produce 4,000,000
TH/s, which was the hash rate of the Bitcoin network at the
time. Hence, Bitcoin’s network could be recreated with a $660
million spend, which would give an attacker control of 50
percent of the network. Yes, 50 percent, because if the hash
rate started at 100, and an attacker bought enough to recreate it
(100), then the hash rate would double to 200, at which point
the attacker has a 50 percent share.
Ethereum’s mining network, on the other hand, is less built
out because it’s a younger ecosystem that stores less value. As
of March 2017, a 230 megahash per second (MH/s) mining
machine could be purchased for $4,195,  and it would take
70,000 of these machines to recreate Ethereum’s hash rate,
totaling $294 million in value. Also, because Ethereum is
supported by GPUs and not ASICs, the machines can more
easily be constructed piecemeal by a hobbyist on a budget.
Using $660 million for Bitcoin and $294 million for
Ethereum, while the network values for the two
cryptocurrencies are respectively US$17.1 billion and $4.7
billion, we get a range of 3.9 cents to 6.3 cents of capital
expenditure per dollar secured by the network. This range is a
good baseline for the innovative investor to use for other
cryptoassets to ensure they are secured with a similar level of
capital spend as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the two best
secured assets in the blockchain ecosystem.
BE CAREFUL WHEN DIRECTLY COMPARING HASH RATES
BETWEEN CRYPTOASSETS
While it may initially seem logical to do, it’s often not
appropriate to directly compare the hash rate of different
3

cryptoassets to judge relative security, because the type of
machines providing the hash rate can vary among different
blockchains, as can their cost. As we covered in Chapters 4
and 5, different blockchain architectures use different hash
functions in the consensus process. Different hash
functions are suitable for different kinds of chips, be they
CPUs, GPUs, or ASICs, and these chips come in
computers that vary in cost. For example, Bitcoin is mined
with ASICs, which yield the greatest hash rate per dollar
spent, while Ethereum is mined mostly with GPUs.
Therefore, $1,000 will purchase more hash rate for a
Bitcoin computer than an Ethereum computer, and it is this
dollar value that’s most important in deterring attackers
from attempting to recreate the network. Hence, while as
of March 2017 Bitcoin’s hash rate of 4,000,000 TH/s was
technically 250,000-fold higher than Ethereum’s 16,000
GH/s, this does not mean Bitcoin was 250,000 times more
secure than Ethereum.
Decentralized Assets Should Have Decentralized Miners
Overall, hash rate is important, but so too is its
decentralization. After all, if the hash rate is extremely high
but 75 percent of it is controlled by a single entity, then that is
not a decentralized system. It is actually a highly centralized
system and therefore vulnerable to the whims of that one
entity. If a cryptoasset is vulnerable to the whims of a single
entity or small oligarchy, then that person or small group could
choose to perform a 51 percent attack at some point, either to
crush the value of the asset (a malicious kamikaze attack), or
to try to profit from spending money they don’t have. Such a

risk must be considered and avoided.
Figures 13.3, 13.4, and 13.5 are charts showing the hash
rate distribution among miners for Ethereum, Litecoin, and
Bitcoin as of March 2017.

Figure 13.5 
 Bitcoin’s hash rate distribution
Data sourced from https://blockchain.info/pools
It’s apparent that Litecoin is the most centralized, while
Bitcoin is the most decentralized. A way to quantify the
decentralization is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI),
which is a metric to measure competition and market
concentration.  For example, the U.S. Department of Justice
uses the HHI when examining potential mergers and
4

acquisitions, to assess how they may influence the
centralization of the industry.  The metric is calculated by
taking the percent market share of each entity, squaring each
market share, and summing these squares before multiplying
by 10,000.
For example, a system that has two players with 50 percent
market share apiece would have an HHI of 5,000, because
(0.5 ) + (.5 ) = 0.5, and 0.5 × 10,000 = 5,000. For the HHI,
anything less than 1,500 qualifies as a competitive
marketplace, anything between 1,500 to 2,500 is a moderately
concentrated marketplace, and anything greater than 2,500 is a
highly concentrated marketplace.
Blockchain networks should never classify as a highly
concentrated marketplace, and ideally, should always fall into
the competitive marketplace category. The more concentrated
a marketplace is, the closer a single entity can be to gaining
majority share of the compute power and performing a 51
percent attack. Figure 13.6 shows that both Bitcoin and
Ethereum qualify as competitive marketplaces, while Litecoin
is a moderately concentrated marketplace.

The centralization of miners in different blockchain
networks varies over time depending on how much growth the
cryptoasset experiences and the evolution of the compute
infrastructure to support it. For example, Figure 13.7 is a graph
of Bitcoin’s HHI index over time.

At times, Bitcoin has been a moderately concentrated
marketplace, just as Litecoin mining is currently a moderately
concentrated marketplace. Litecoin recognizes the impact that
large mining pools can have on the health of its ecosystem and
the quality of its coin. To that point, Litecoin developers have
instituted an awareness campaign called “Spread the Hashes”
for those mining litecoin to consider spreading out their
mining activities.  The campaign recommends that litecoin
computers mine with a variety of mining pools rather than
concentrating solely in one.
Geographic Distribution of Miners

Geographic Distribution of Miners
Beyond hash rate and the percent distribution of hash rate
ownership, it’s also important to know how geographically
distributed the computers are that are maintaining a
cryptoasset’s blockchain. After all, if the miners for a
cryptoasset are all in a single country, then that cryptoasset
could be at the mercy of that nation’s government. This
provides a macroeconomic view that should be incorporated
into our fundamental analysis of these assets.
Much has been made about how many of the largest mining
firms have facilities in China or Iceland  where the cost of
electricity is low. However, by looking at all the Bitcoin nodes
(a location where the Bitcoin software has been downloaded
and Bitcoin’s blockchain is being maintained), locating where
the overall activity is concentrated becomes clearer. Figure
13.8 shows the distribution of bitcoin nodes  on a global
basis.

People are often confused when they see Figure 13.8 as the
United States and Germany have the most Bitcoin nodes,
while China is lower in the list, which at face value seems to
contradict the idea that most miners are in China. Not all
nodes are made equal. A single node could have a large
number of mining computers behind it, hence capturing a large
percentage of the overall network’s hash rate, while another
node could have a single mining computer supporting it,
amounting to a tiny fraction of Bitcoin’s hash rate. A node is
merely a point of connection to the network, and they differ
drastically in the compute power they contribute. Hence, the
combination of geographic node distribution and hash rate
concentration amongst the nodes gives a fuller picture of the
decentralization of hardware supporting a cryptoasset.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS
William Mougayar, author of The Business Blockchain, has
written extensively about how to identify and evaluate new
blockchain ventures and sums up the importance of developers
succinctly: “Before users can trust the protocol, they need to
trust the people who created it.”  As we touched upon in the
prior chapter, investigate the prior qualifications of lead
developers for a protocol as much as possible.
While the initial pedigree of developers is important, so too
is their long-term commitment. Developers shouldn’t create a
protocol and simply walk away. These systems are made of
open-source software, which must evolve over time to stay
secure and relevant. If no one is maintaining the software, then
two things will happen: One, bugs will be found and exploited
11

by bad actors. Two, without enough developers, the software
will stagnate, ultimately losing out to more compelling
projects.
Developers have their own network effect: the more smart
developers there are working on a project, the more useful and
intriguing that project becomes to other developers. These
developers are then drawn to the project, and a positively
reinforcing flywheel is created. On the other hand, if
developers are exiting a project, then it quickly becomes less
and less interesting to other developers, ultimately leaving no
one to captain the software ship. With no one at the helm, then
the companies and users relying upon it will ultimately defect
as well, all of which will drop the value of the cryptoasset.
While developer activity is incredibly important, it is also
notoriously hard to quantify with accuracy. Most cryptoasset
projects are stored and orchestrated through GitHub, which
has its own set of graphs of developer activity. Graphs include
categories like contributors, commits, code frequency, punch
card, and network, though many of them lack meaningful data.
For example, while a graph can be seen on contributions,
sometimes more contributions can be a negative factor if it
was associated with a major bug being found in the software
and developers rushing to fix it. Furthermore, each cryptoasset
is composed of many different projects, which makes getting a
broad view on GitHub hard to do.
As a solution, CryptoCompare has sought to amalgamate
developer activity and metrics to make it easier to compare the
different cryptoassets. Figure 13.9 is a graph with a metric
CryptoCompare has created called Code Repository Points,
which they explain as follows: “Code Repository points are
12

awarded as follows: 1 for a star, 2 for a fork (somebody trying
to create a copy or just play with the code), and 3 for each
subscriber.”
A star is when someone stars code on GitHub, which users
do to bookmark the code and show appreciation for it.  We
explained forks in detail in Chapter 5 around the DAOsaster,
but in this instance, a fork is a good thing. It refers to a
situation where new developers forked the code of the
cryptoasset to experiment with it. Recall that this is how
Litecoin, Dash, and Zcash were created from Bitcoin:
developers forked Bitcoin’s code, modified it, and then re-
released the software with different functionality. Subscribers
refer to people wanting to stay actively involved with the code.
In short, the more code repository points, the more developer
activity has occurred around the cryptoasset’s code.

However, what’s unfair about this metric is that bitcoin has
been around for over eight years, while other cryptoassets
have been around for a fraction of that time. Standardizing for
the amount of time the cryptoassets have been under
construction yields the graph in Figure 13.10.
Figure 13.10 
 Frequency of developer activity for different cryptoassets (March
29, 2017)
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
Using this standardized measure for developer activity, it’s
clear Bitcoin and Ethereum are two standout projects. With
Dash as the baseline, Ripple developers are 80 percent more
active and Monero developers 40 percent more. However, the
phrase “You get what you pay for” comes to mind. With
network values of $17.1 billion for Bitcoin and $4.7 billion for
Ethereum, it makes sense that their developers are so active.
Their activity has clearly built a valuable platform that many
14

people are drawn to use. With Dash, Ripple, and Monero at
network values of $600 million, $360 million, and $280
million respectively, it’s understandable that they don’t have
as wide and active a developer base.
To calibrate for network value, in Figure 13.11 we take the
total network value of a cryptoasset and divide it by the
cumulative repository points, the idea being that a certain
amount of work has gone into creating each cryptoasset,
begging the question, “What is the dollar value per repository
point?” The higher this number, the dearer each repository
point is valued, and potentially overvalued.
Figure 13.11 
 Dollar value per code repository point for different cryptoassets
(March 29, 2017)
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
Using this methodology, as of March 2017 Dash was the
cryptoasset architecture most valued by the market, as people
were paying roughly $500,000 per repository point, though

this does not mean it will stay that way. Interestingly, Bitcoin
and Ethereum are very close, while Ripple and Monero
seemingly have the most undervalued developers.
Another good site for monitoring overall developer activity
is OpenHub.  For example, OpenHub shows the number of
lines of code that have been written for a project, as shown in
Figure 13.12.
Figure 13.12  Lines of code written for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero as shown
by OpenHub Data sourced from OpenHub
Possessing more lines of code is not necessarily better for
an asset. Sometimes the opposite is true, and less is more
because a great developer can write the same program in half
the number of lines as a mediocre developer. Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and Monero are quite different, so it’s hard to
compare them directly. Bitcoin aims to be minimalist, while
15

Monero has added privacy functionality, and Ethereum is the
most expansive in scope. Most important, all three rank as
Very High Activity on OpenHub’s activity meter.
While these metrics of developer activity are by no means
authoritative, they give some idea of what to look for when
exploring the commitment and activity of the developers
behind a cryptoasset.
COMPANY SUPPORT
Similar in difficulty to assessing developer support is
assessing company support for a cryptoasset. Websites like
SpendBitcoins.com  inform visitors how many places accept
a specific cryptoasset; a metric important for cryptocurrencies
but not so much for cryptocommodities and cryptotokens.
A different approach is to monitor the number of
companies supporting a cryptoasset, which can be done by
tracking venture capital investments. CoinDesk provides some
of this information as seen in Figure 13.13. Though, as we will
address in Chapter 16 on ICOs, the trend in this space is
moving away from venture funding and toward crowdfunding.

Getting a longitudinal view on how companies are
supporting a cryptoasset over time is more important than a
single snapshot. One of the best metrics we have found as a
proxy for company support is the number of exchanges that

support a cryptoasset. As a cryptoasset gains greater
legitimacy and support, an increasing number of exchanges
carry it. As mentioned in Chapter 9, the last exchanges to add
a cryptoasset are the most regulated exchanges, such as
Bitstamp, GDAX, and Gemini. These exchanges have strong
brands and relations with regulators that they need to protect,
so they won’t support a cryptoasset until it has undergone
thorough technological and market-based vetting. A simple
Google search is enough to discern which exchanges support
which cryptoassets. Volume aggregators like CoinMarketCap
also give insight into which exchanges support which
currencies.
Another good proxy for the increased acceptance of a
cryptoasset and its growing offering by highly regulated
exchanges is the amount of fiat currency used to purchase it.
As also mentioned in Chapter 9, in the early days of a
cryptoasset listing, the majority of the volume often goes
through bitcoin, meaning that buys and sells are done in
bitcoin, not dollars or euros. As cryptoassets grow in diversity,
so too do their trading pairs with fiat currencies, as shown with
Ethereum’s ether in Figure 13.14.
17

Figure 13.14 
 Ether’s growing currency pair diversity
Data sourced from CryptoCompare
In the one-year period from March 2016 to March 2017,
ether went from being traded 12 percent of the time with fiat
currency to 50 percent of the time. This is a good sign of the
maturation of an asset, and shows it is gaining wider
recognition and acceptance.
USER ADOPTION
A number of metrics can assess the state and rate of
mainstream adoption. We will focus on those that display the
traction of people using the cryptoasset for its core utility. The
basic metrics are:
•   Number of users

•   Number of transactions propagated on the blockchain
•   Dollar value of those transactions
•   Valuation metric, which is the network value of a
cryptoasset divided by its daily dollar transaction
volume
We include examples of these metrics for Bitcoin and
Ethereum. It should be noted that many of these numbers are
not easily accessible for the other cryptoassets because they
are still in their very early days, and thus data has not been
extracted and presented in an easily digestible manner. Even
for Ethereum, certain metrics are not as easily accessible as
they are for Bitcoin. Two of the best data resources for Bitcoin
and Ethereum respectively are Blockchain.info’s charts
section  and Etherscan’s charts section,  and we posit that
other cryptoassets will have similar services built to extract
and visualize data from their blockchains.
Number of Users
Figure 13.15 shows the number of wallet users for
Blockchain.info, a leading bitcoin wallet provider (a wallet is
where bitcoin users store the keys to access their bitcoin).
Clearly, having more users with wallets that can hold a
cryptoasset is good for that asset: more users, more usage,
more acceptance. While the chart shows an exponential trend,
there are a few drawbacks to this metric. For one, it only
shows the growth of Blockchain.info’s wallet users, but many
other wallet providers exist. For example, as of March 2017,
Coinbase had 14.2 million wallets, on par with
Blockchain.info. Second, an individual can have more than
18
19

one wallet, so some of these numbers could be due to users
creating many wallets, a flaw which extends to other wallet
providers and their metrics as well.
Figure 13.15  Blockchain.info wallet users over time
Data sourced from Blockchain.info
Willy Woo, a Coindesk.com contributor, utilized Google
Trends to evaluate the searches done on Google for the term
“BTC USD.” He wanted to do this as “an effective proxy for
the growth and engagement of bitcoin over time.”  In other
words, he wanted to use this metric to determine the growth of
bitcoin users. Figure 13.16 shows the trend of this search term
over time. Woo indicates that the peaks “are in line with price
bubbles, periods where more users head online to check the
value of their wealth.” Woo makes the leap that an active
bitcoin user checks the price every day, so he believes the
chart helps to identify the number of bitcoin users.
If we assume this to be true, then Woo’s analysis indicates
a doubling in bitcoin users every year and an order of
magnitude growth every 3.375 years. He calls this Woo’s Law
20

in honor of Moore’s Law  (which is famous for predicting
that the manufacturing density of transistors per square inch
would double every eighteen months). It will be interesting to
see how Woo’s Law holds up over time.

growth/
Consider too, the number of addresses on a blockchain. For
Bitcoin, an address is where bitcoin is sent, and therefore the
more addresses, the more locations that are holding bitcoin.
However, a company like Coinbase may have only a handful
of addresses, which serve to store bitcoin for millions of users.
Thus, while this metric shows a nice up-and-to-the-right trend,
it’s only part of the picture.
Figure 13.17 shows the hyper growth of Ethereum’s unique
address count. With Ethereum, an address can either store a
balance of ether, like Bitcoin, or it can store a smart contract.
Either denotes an increase in use.

Number of Transactions
Figures 13.18 and 13.19 show the number of transactions
using Bitcoin and Ethereum’s blockchains respectively. The
rising numbers are healthy signs for each of the blockchains
and their associated cryptoassets. This information for bitcoin
can be accessed on Blockchain.info  and for ether at
Etherscan.

Dollar Value of Transactions
While the number of transactions is an important metric, it
says nothing about the monetary value of those transactions.
Figure 13.20 shows the numbers for bitcoin. In the first quarter
of 2017, Bitcoin was processing over $270 million per day,
which translates to $188,000 per minute or $3,100 per
second.

A Potential Valuation Method
Just as valuation methods for equities have evolved over the
years, so too will methods to value cryptoassets grow over
time. One valuation method we’re considering is to calibrate
how much the market is willing to pay for the transactional
24

utility of a blockchain. To gain this information, we divide the
network value of a cryptoasset by its daily transaction volume.
If the network value has outpaced the transactional volume of
that asset, then this ratio will grow larger, which could imply
the price of the asset has outpaced its utility. We call this the
crypto “PE ratio,” taking inspiration from the common ratio
used for equities. For cryptoassets we put forth that the
denominator of valuation should be transaction volumes, not
earnings, as these are not companies with cash flows.
One would assume that an efficient price for an asset would
indicate a steadiness of network value to the transaction
volume of the asset. Increasing transactional volume of an
asset should be met by a similar increase in the value of that
asset. Upside swings in pricing without similar swings in
transaction volume could indicate an overheating of the
market and thus, overvaluation of an asset.
Over time, the market will likely find a happy medium for
this ratio, just as equity markets find a happy medium for price
to sales or price to earnings ratios. Cryptoassets, including
bitcoin, are still too young with too little market data to claim
exactly where this equilibrium ratio will stabilize. That said,
looking at Figure 13.21, it appears that bitcoin has a
comfortable base when its network value is 50 times its daily
transactional volume. Maintaining a price that keeps the ratio
near 50 could indicate that the asset is being fairly priced, and
wide swings beyond that range can signal bearish or bullish
trends.

SUMMARY ON OPERATING
FUNDAMENTALS
The process of performing fundamental analysis on a new
asset class such as cryptoassets is in its early stages. As much
as possible we’ve tried to utilize the rigor and depth available
through many of the tools equity analysts have used over the
years to come up with the useful metrics we’ve provided in
these two chapters. Obviously, the study of equities and
cryptoassets are fundamentally different. Yet we’ve tried to
create resources and approaches for this type of analysis that
can hold up over time as cryptoassets continue to grow and
mature. We also know that as more data is created, as new
trends are identified, and as more analysts enter the

cryptoasset space, many of the resources we’ve utilized here
may be superseded by even more elaborate and exact tools.
It’s our hope that we have provided innovative investors
with tools to do the necessary research and evaluation of these
assets, as they would do with any other investment in their
portfolio. Just as this chapter will help arm the innovative
investor, we’d like to see it provide future cryptoasset analysts
with the tools to continue to build more robust fundamental
analysis models for these assets.
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF
CRYPTOASSETS
Technical analysis comes with its own tools and metrics.
Although fundamental analysis differs between cryptoassets
and other asset classes, technical analysis is largely the same.
Technical analysis is simply the evaluation of the price and
volume movements of an asset over time to help time buys and
sells. Of course, it’s not a guaranteed method for finding the
exact “right time” to buy or sell, but technical analysis has
become a powerful tool that bitcoin and other cryptoasset
traders use to understand market timing. Technical analysis is
best used in conjunction with fundamental analysis to identify
appropriate investments and when to make them. Here we
provide some basic charts and considerations that the
innovative investor can use.
Support and Resistance
Charting the support and resistance lines of an asset’s price
movement over time is a tried and tested tool for technical

analysis. Figure 13.22 shows bitcoin’s price movement
through the year 2015, a period where it oscillated within a
predictable trading range. In Figure 13.22 the top line is called
the resistance line, indicating a price that bitcoin is having
trouble breaking through. Often these lines can be numbers of
psychological weight, in this case the $300 mark. When the
price of bitcoin hits $300 it shows a tendency to bounce back
into its trading range. On the flip side of resistance is support,
which shows a price that bitcoin doesn’t want to violate, in
this case $200. Each time bitcoin nears the support line it
bounces back into its trading range, and the one time that it
breaks through this support it quickly climbs above it again.
Note that while this range can be a helpful guide, an asset
doesn’t always remain range-bound. For example, at the end
of the depicted range the price seems to be breaking out to
potentially form a new higher price and new trading range. For
many technical analysts, such a breakout accompanied by high
trading volume is a buy signal as it signifies something notable
has happened to push the market to value the asset more
richly. Often, previous resistance lines will become support
lines if the asset has broken through a resistance line
convincingly and stays elevated. Similarly, a prior line of
support can become a point of resistance if the asset crashes
through its prior support and stays beneath that line.

Data sourced from CoinDesk
This simple illustration of support and resistance lines is
expanded on within detailed technical analysis resources
available online, including the work of Brian Beamish of The
Rational Investor,  among others.
Simple Moving Average
One of the most common tools for technical analysts is the
simple moving average, or SMA, which smooths out the price
trend of an asset over a period of time.
SMAs are provided by most online charting sites and, as
the name implies, the calculation is simple. It merely plots the
average price of an asset over a period of time, and that period
can be days, weeks, or months. It’s called a moving average
25

because with each new day there is a new average, which
includes the price on the newest day, while dropping the price
of the oldest day. Hence, the average moves over time.
Common averages include 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day
moving averages, as well as longer term averages, like the
200-week moving average to observe trends on larger time
scales. SMAs can indicate points of support and resistance and
when used together can indicate changes in momentum.
Cryptocompare.com makes the point:
Often simple moving averages are used in conjunction with each other to
spot trend reversals and shifts in momentum. For example when a short term
SMA is below a longer term one and then crosses it—you have indicated an
upward shift in momentum that is a buy signal.
Figure 13.23 shows bitcoin’s price from the launch of Mt.
Gox in July 2010 through the end of 2012, along with its 50-
and 200-day SMAs. Note that an average doesn’t begin until
enough days have passed for the first point to be plotted. To
CryptoCompare’s point, in the spring of 2012 the 50-day SMA
punched through the 200-day SMA, and stayed above it,
indicating upward momentum. Inversely, if a short term
average crashes beneath a long term average, that is a bearish
signal as the price of the asset is falling quickly and is
commonly referred to as a death cross. Such behavior can be
seen in the fall of 2011 when the 50-day moving average fell
beneath the 200-day moving average.

Pay Attention to Volume
Because of the varying levels of trading that occur with
cryptoassets, it’s important for the innovative investor to pay
close attention to the trading volume of an asset. For a young
cryptoasset, it’s not unusual to see price increases or decreases
along with low volume. This indicates that the trading book is
thin and thus the asset is susceptible to wild swings in price.
By including an analysis of volume, these swings in price can
indicate a sustained trend or a temporary movement. As
Charles Bovaird points out in his piece on Technical Analysis
for Coindesk.com,
Bitcoin traders should keep in mind that volume plays an important role in
evaluating price trends. High volume points to strong price trends, while

low volume indicates weaker trends. Generally, rising prices coincide with
increasing volume. If bitcoin prices enjoy an uptrend, but the currency’s
upward movements take place amid weak volume, this could mean that the
trend is running out of gas and could soon be over.
Similarly, a falling price with increasingly strong volume
indicates capitulation as traders are rushing for the exits,
whereas a falling price on low volume is of less concern.
Remember, most cryptoassets are still in an early stage, and
as such, technical charts for these assets will lack the history
of longer term assets such as bitcoin. You’ll find many
instances of newer cryptoassets experiencing wild price
swings after their creation, but over time these younger assets
begin to follow the rules of technical analysis. This is a sign
that these assets are maturing, and as such, are being followed
by a broader group of traders. This indicates they can be more
fully analyzed and evaluated using technical analysis, allowing
the innovative investor to better time the market and identify
buy and sell opportunities.
• • •
Innovative investors must independently examine bitcoin and
other cryptoassets, avoiding the temptation to buy or sell
simply because everyone else is doing so. There’s a growing
wealth of information and data online on each of these assets,
and if investors can’t find enough data on an asset to perform
the necessary analysis, that’s probably a sign that it should be
avoided as an investment. Let’s call that the Burniske-Tatar
Law.
Once the innovative investor has performed the necessary
fundamental and technical analysis, the next step is to pull the
trigger and actually make the investment. In the next few
27

chapters we’ll present the wide, and still growing, range of
opportunities for investors to gain access to bitcoin and other
cryptoassets.

Chapter 14
Investing Directly in
Cryptoassets: Mining,
Exchanges, and Wallets
oday, investors have many avenues for purchasing bitcoin and
other cryptoassets. Options will continue to evolve, but
broadly there are two main considerations: how to acquire
cryptoassets and how to store them. Since cryptoassets are
digital bearer instruments, they are unlike many other
investments that are held by a centralized custodian. For
example, regardless of which platform an investor uses to buy
stocks, there is a centralized custodian who is “housing” the
assets and keeping track of the investor’s balance.  With
cryptoassets, the innovative investor can opt for a similar
situation or can have full autonomy and control in storage. The
avenue chosen depends on what the innovative investor most
values, and as with much of life, there are always trade-offs.
MINING
A brief history of the evolution of mining is needed so that the
1

innovative investor can better understand the current state of
affairs for bitcoin and other cryptoassets. From there, it is
easier to decide if this avenue of acquisition is appropriate.
Even for those who have no interest in mining themselves, it’s
valuable to have a deeper understanding because for many
cryptoassets mining is the means of new supply issuance and
the security system underpinning transactions.
When Bitcoin’s network was launched in January 2009,
mining was the only method of acquiring bitcoin, and Satoshi
Nakamoto and Hal Finney were the two main miners.  As
we’ve discussed, new bitcoin is minted through the process of
verifying and confirming transactions in Bitcoin’s blockchain,
the orchestration of which is a large part of the software that
Satoshi created. In this way, it ensures the decentralized
creation of the currency in controlled amounts, which prior to
bitcoin had not been accomplished on a global scale.
The mining process for bitcoin is a continual cycle of
hashing a few pieces of data together in pursuit of an output
that meets a predetermined difficulty level, mainly the number
of 0s that the output starts with. We call this output the golden
hash. Recall that a hash function takes data—for example the
text in this sentence—and hashes it into a fixed-length string
of alphanumeric digits. While the output of a hash function is
always of fixed length, the characters within it are
unpredictable, and therefore changing one piece of data in the
input can drastically change the output. It’s called a golden
hash because it bestows the privilege of that miner’s block of
transactions being appended to Bitcoin’s blockchain. As a
reward, that miner gets paid in a coinbase transaction, which is
the first transaction in the block. Currently, that transaction
2

delivers 12.5 bitcoin to the lucky miner.
The computers involved in Bitcoin’s mining process take
four pieces of data: a hash of the transactions for that block,
the hash (identifier) of the previous block,  the time, and a
random number called the nonce. Different computers on the
network take these four variables and increment the nonce,
perhaps starting with a nonce equal to 0, then going to 1, then
to 2, hoping that by changing this one variable the hash output
will meet the necessary requirement of the number of starting
zeros. The more nonces the miner can test, the more chances
the miner will find a golden hash that meets the requirement.
The rate at which new nonces can be tested is called the hash
rate; it is the number of times per second a computer can run
these four variables through a hash function and derive a new
hash.
Anyone with a computer can connect to Bitcoin’s network,
download past blocks, keep track of new transactions, and
crunch the necessary data in pursuit of the golden hash. Such
open architecture is one of Bitcoin’s strongest points. While
that might sound like an easy way to earn bitcoin, it is now
incredibly difficult. Since the launch of Bitcoin, not only have
the number of computers mining it increased, but the types of
computers used have evolved significantly.
Initially, computers on the network crunched through
hashes using their central processing unit (CPU), which is the
primary chip responsible for the functioning of our computers.
Mining with this method hogged the resources of the
computer. And although a CPU is a good multitasker, it’s not
the most efficient chip for doing the same task over and over,
which is exactly what searching for the golden hash involved.
3

Theoretically, a better chip for mining is the graphical
processing unit (GPU). As its name implies, GPUs are used to
generate the graphics that appear on screens, but they are now
also widely used for machine learning applications. GPUs are
massively parallel processing units, meaning they can run
similar calculations in parallel because they have hundreds or
thousands of mini-processing units, as opposed to CPUs that
have just a handful of processing units.
While the little units within a GPU cannot perform the wide
range of abstract operations that a CPU can, they are good
enough for hashing together data. Since there are thousands or
more of these cores, in aggregate a GPU chip can make many
more attempts at the golden hash per second than a CPU chip
can.
However, to use GPUs a new version of the Bitcoin
software needed to be created that could instruct a GPU how
to go about the process, and writing that code took time. It was
finally released in the summer of 2010, after Jeff Garzik
offered a reward of 10,000 bitcoin to the originators—a
mining operation known as puddinpop—to open source the
software for all to use.  While he may not have expected the
price to rise so much in the coming years, Garzik’s donation
now totals more than $10 million.
While GPUs were a vast improvement over CPUs, two
more iterations of technology occurred to produce a more
efficient chip for faster guessing of golden hashes. First came
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), an interim chip,
before the granddaddy of them all appeared: application-
specific integrated circuits (ASICs). As the name implies,
ASICs are application-specific, meaning that the physical
4
5

hardware must be designed and manufactured with the
application in mind. CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs can all be
bought generically and, with proper engineering, be applied to
a specific purpose after the purchase. The physical layout of
ASICs, on the other hand, needs to be etched into the chip at
the semiconductor fabrication factory.
Designing and manufacturing such a specific chip requires
a significant initial investment, and it was only when Bitcoin’s
network became big enough and bitcoin worth enough that a
company could fully pursue this opportunity. The first
computer—or mining rig—with ASIC chips that were
specifically manufactured for the process was connected in
January 2013.  Currently, top-of-the-line ASICs have a hash
rate of 14 TH/s, meaning these machines crunch data and
output a hash 14 trillion times a second.
Collectively, the more computers attached to the Bitcoin
network, the higher the odds of one of them discovering a
golden hash. Without any adjustment, more computers would
increase the supply rate of new bitcoin, leading to runaway
supply inflation. For that reason, Satoshi built into Bitcoin’s
software the rule that as more compute power is added to the
network, the network makes it harder to find the golden hash
by increasing the number of zeros the hash is required to start
with. This adjustment is made every 2,018 blocks, or every
two weeks, with the target of miners finding a golden hash
every 10 minutes, and thereby controlling the rate at which
new bitcoin is minted. As a result, more and more people are
competing for a smaller and smaller prize, which while still
profitable for professional miners is largely out of reach of
Bitcoin hobbyists. For perspective, the combined compute
6
7

power of Bitcoin’s network is over 100,000 times faster than
the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined.
Mining Beyond Bitcoin
While the strength of Bitcoin’s mining network is legendary,
most other cryptoassets are less daunting. If so inclined,
mining within networks such as Ethereum, Zcash, and others
is still open to enthusiastic and dedicated hobbyists, and none
of these networks is dominated by ASICs (yet).  In fact, recall
that one of the frequent adjustments subsequent assets made
was to the block hashing algorithm to fight against
centralization of miners. For that reason, ether, zcash, and
many other cryptoassets are mostly mined wtih GPUs. As
these assets grow in value, though, their mining networks
become more competitive because the potential profit of
getting paid in the native asset becomes more desirable.
Conceptually, mining networks are a perfect competition, and
thus as margins increase, new participants will flood in until
economic equilibrium is once again achieved. Thus, the
greater the value of the asset, the more money miners make,
which draws new miners into the ecosystem, thereby
increasing the security of the network. It’s a virtuous cycle that
ensures the bigger the network value of a cryptoasset, the more
security there is to support it.
Whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Zcash, many miners
join mining pools, which means they connect with other
miners and collectively the pool contributes their hash power
to finding golden hashes. The pool then shares in the profits,
with different models for how the profits are split.  A single
miner might find only a block once a month, or worse. By
8
9
10

being part of a pool, miners get a more predictable revenue
stream.
There are a few major costs to mining: equipment, physical
space necessary for the machines, electricity, and labor. For
Bitcoin, dedicated mining devices are available, such as those
from Antminer and Avalon, and the key metric to look for is
the efficiency of the machine. In other words, how many
hashes are generated for a certain amount of power, expressed
in the ratio watts per gigahash (W/GH). To help better
understand these cost calculations, refer to mining profitability
calculation websites, such as CoinWarz.
Cloud-Based Mining Pools
Innovative investors may consider a cloud-based mining pool
service. Here, an investor buys into an existing mining pool
and shares in the rewards from its mining efforts. There’s no
need for owning and maintaining dedicated hardware, just as
cloud-based software such as Salesforce doesn’t require
maintaining all the back-end hardware. Investors simply buy a
share of the processing power provided by mining efforts
performed in a remote data center.
Thorough due diligence and research are needed before
buying into a cloud-based mining pool service because a fair
share of fraud and scams have occurred. A study of Bitcoin-
based scams by Professors Marie Vasek and Tyler Moore from
SMU included findings that several cloud-based mining
operations were Ponzi schemes that “take payments from
‘investors’ but never deliver product.” Their research even
identified specific mining scams. “Active Mining and Ice Drill
are operations that raised money to purportedly make ASICs
11

and share the profits but never delivered.
AsicMiningEquipment.com and Dragon-Miner.com are
fraudulent mining e-commerce websites.”
Before investing in a cloud-based mining pool, conduct
research on the potential investment. If it sounds too good to
be true, it probably is. Verify that the operation has a physical
location, a listing of existing equipment, and a track record of
past projects. Genesis Mining is one of the largest cloud-based
bitcoin mining pool services.  It’s been in business since
2013 and offers mining in bitcoin, litecoin, zcash, and ether.
On its website it shows photos and videos of its data centers;
many are in Iceland where electricity costs are low due to its
geothermal power.
Proof-of-Stake
Outside of proof-of-work, other consensus mechanisms exist,
such as proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-stake can be thought of
as an alternative form of mining, one that doesn’t require lots
of hardware and electricity, but instead requires people to put
their reputation and assets at risk to help validate transactions.
Logistically, proof-of-stake requires transaction validators to
“stake” a balance of the cryptoasset and then attest to the
validity of transactions in blocks. If validators are lying or
otherwise deceiving the network, they will lose their staked
assets. As the name implies, in “proving they have something
at stake,” the validators are incentivized to be honest.
Often these systems provide an interest rate, like 5 percent,
that rewards the validators who have staked their assets to help
in the transaction validation process. There are also hybrid
proof-of-work, proof-of-stake mining ecosystems and other
12
13
14

variations, but proof-of-work is the most well-proven
consensus mechanism, and the majority of cryptoassets use it.
However, Ethereum will potentially switch to proof-of-stake
early in 2018, as it is more efficient from an energy
perspective, and therefore many claim is more scalable. When
Ethereum switches from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, it
will be a major proving point for the viability of this consensus
mechanism to secure large-scale cryptoasset networks.
CRYPTOASSET EXCHANGES AND OTC
DESKS
Once bitcoin and other cryptoassets are minted, miners can
exchange them for other cryptoassets or the fiat currency of
their choice. To do so, the miner must sell the cryptoasset to
someone else, either over-the-counter (OTC) or through an
exchange.
Many miners, and large investors, choose OTC services
like those provided by Cumberland Mining, Genesis Trading,
or itBit. OTC is not quite an exchange because the buy and sell
orders are not out in the open. Instead, an entity like the
aforementioned services matches large buys with large sells,
which allows big trades to be made without moving the order
books within an exchange. OTC is a potential path for
accredited innovative investors that want to deploy large
amounts of capital.
Most investors, however, acquire cryptoassets through an
exchange. Depending on the exchange, they can connect their
bank account, credit card, or deposit bitcoin. Trading in the
more novel cryptoassets most often requires that the investor

already has bitcoin, as the exchanges that offer these
cryptoassets often don’t have fiat currency onramps.
During the tumultuous beginning of bitcoin, when it was
the only cryptoasset in existence, numerous exchanges opened
and subsequently closed, and the reasons often weren’t pretty:
financial difficulties, hacks, criminal activities, and actions of
various regulatory authorities, to name a few.  It’s important
to recognize that in the early days of bitcoin, there was no
exchange infrastructure, and since bitcoin was still in its
infancy, people attempting to provide exchange services were
often not equipped to do so.
The first exchange on record was seeded with a transfer of
5,050 bitcoin for $5.02, and actually ended up shutting down a
few months later due to a lack of interest.  Mt. Gox was the
first mainstream exchange, but it took two weeks for a
customer’s account to be cleared, and initially fiat currency
had to be wired to Japan. However, as the assets and
underlying technology have matured, so too have the means of
buying and selling them. To this end, today numerous quality
exchanges are available to investors looking to gain and
transact the more than 800 cryptoassets that currently exist.
Some of the most popular Western exchanges include
Bitstamp, Bittrex, Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX),
Gemini, itBit, Kraken, and Poloniex. BTCC, OKCoin, and
Huobi dominate China, but also offer services in other
geographic locations. There are country-specific exchanges,
such as Bitso in Mexico, Unocoin in India, and BitBay in
Poland.
When deciding which exchange to use, a key trade-off
needs to be considered: security versus access. Security is self-
15
16
17
18

explanatory. By access we refer to the diversity of cryptoassets
on offer. The most regulated exchanges, such as Bitstamp,
GDAX, and Gemini, offer the fewest cryptoassets because
they wait to ensure an asset is past a certain level of maturity
before adding it to their platform. Other exchanges, such as
Poloniex or Bittrex, add assets much earlier in their lives, so
more aggressive or adventurous traders tend to use these
platforms. Not only do these exchanges not have the same
consumer protections in place, but the assets they offer are
much more prone to wild price swings. Exchanges such as
Bitfinex and Kraken provide a mix of security, regulatory
adherence, and access. We are not discouraging use of any of
these exchanges. It all depends on the balance of security and
access the innovative investor is looking for.
To better understand some of the paranoia around exchange
security and reliability, it’s important to know that over time
exchanges have been a weak point because they are
centralized repositories of cryptoassets, which makes them
targets for hacking. Unlike a bank heist which requires
physical force and puts the thieves’ lives at risk, thefts of
cryptoassets from an exchange can be accomplished with
(relatively) clean hands from anywhere in the world. Beyond
the ability to steal assets from afar, the irreversible nature of
cryptoasset transactions makes them even more enticing to
hackers. If someone steals a credit card or hacks into a bank
account, the associated institution can reverse the transactions.
With cryptoassets, there is no centralized intermediary to come
to the rescue.
THE HIDDEN COST OF CHARGEBACKS

Chargebacks occur when a customer disputes a credit card
charge and that charge is reversed. Often, when the charge
is reversed, it is the merchant that takes the loss.
Processing and investigating these chargebacks incur a
cost for the credit card company, which are then often
levied as fees against the merchant. Due to these extra
costs, merchants may need to adjust prices to protect
themselves from both legitimate and illegitimate disputed
charges.
Cryptoasset transactions are irreversible; therefore
chargebacks are impossible. While an irreversible
transaction may sound scary, it actually benefits the
efficiency of the overall system. With credit card
chargebacks, everyone has to bear the cost, whereas with
cryptoassets only those who are careless bear the cost.
Many claim that hacked exchanges are proof that
cryptoassets are insecure, but this displays a fundamental
misunderstanding of the software architecture. Recall the four
layers of any blockchain ecosystem that we discussed in
Chapter 2: decentralized hardware, cryptoasset software,
applications, and users. It is the third layer, applications, that
are targeted in the majority of hacks. Thus, an exchange,
which is an application that runs on top of the cryptoasset
software, gets hacked. The underlying blockchain performs its
job perfectly and remains uncompromised. The same analogy
can be applied to applications that run on Apple’s operating
systems. Just because one of the apps is hacked doesn’t mean
Apple’s underlying operating system or hardware is insecure.
Understanding that it’s the applications and exchanges that
use and trade cryptoassets that are most susceptible to hacks,

it’s all the more important for the innovative investor to be
diligent when deciding which exchange to use. The following
should be taken into consideration.
What Is the Reputation of the Exchange?
The best way to ascertain reputation is to investigate the
management, venture capital investors, and regulatory
approvals. Search reputable online sites to see what others are
saying about the exchanges. Are there frequent customer
complaints? In particular, look for whether an exchange has
experienced a hack or had business problems in the past. This
can be as easy as just typing the name of the exchange and the
word “hack” into Google. For instance, “Bitfinex hack.” While
having been hacked can be a concern, consider what changes
the exchanges have made since any security breach. One other
good thing to note is where the exchange is physically
headquartered. If that information isn’t available, it’s probably
best to avoid the exchange.
What Cryptoassets Are Available for Trading?
For investors seeking specific assets, make sure the exchange
offers trading in the desired cryptoasset. It’s critical to
understand that exchanges with a large number of cryptoassets
are at greater operational risk. They typically perform less due
diligence on those assets, which then passes that risk and
responsibility on to the investor.
Are Extra Capabilities Offered, Like Derivatives or Margin
Trading?
As with the variety of cryptoassets, exchanges also differ in

the capabilities they offer. Some provide derivatives products
such as futures contracts, while others specialize in boutique
derivatives. For example, a boutique derivative offering by
BitMEX was an option on whether the Winklevoss ETF would
be approved by the SEC in March 2017. Similarly, margin
trading is another functionality to investigate, and not all
margin trading is made equal. Some exchanges offer extreme
levels of margin trading, like 30 to 1, while others are much
more reserved, like 3 to 1. Also referred to as leverage, 30 to 1
margin trading means an investor only has to put down $1,000
to trade with $30,000 of money. While gains can be
astronomical, so can losses, and the same applies to
derivatives. Some exchanges “socialize losses” for leverage
gone wrong because there is no other way the products can be
offered.  Socializing losses means that all investors on the
exchange take a loss for a few investors’ foolhardiness.
What Funding Mechanisms Are Available to Open an
Account?
Funding mechanisms will dictate whether the innovative
investor can use the service to begin with. Investors who
already own bitcoin have more options because exchanges will
accept a direct transfer of bitcoin that will allow for immediate
trading of the cryptoassets offered on the platform. Funding an
account with fiat currency typically requires links to bank
accounts or credit cards. They will require a more extensive
account opening process that may extend over several days
and run into local restrictions. When providing bank account
information to an exchange, it’s especially important to have
done the research on that entity to ensure security. Providing
19

bank account information to any financial entity online is not
to be taken lightly.
Is the Service Geographically Constrained?
Some exchanges are restricted by geography, and thus will
require an address for access to certain aspects of their
services. This is particularly relevant for New York residents,
where the BitLicense has made it considerably harder for
cryptoasset startups to operate. The BitLicense was a piece of
regulation put in place in 2015 that required companies
interfacing with cryptoassets to go through a lengthy and
expensive regulatory process to operate in New York, which
led the majority of cryptoasset startups to cease operations in
the state.
What Are the KYC and AML Requirements?
Know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering
(AML) regulations are increasingly mandatory for cryptoasset
exchanges in the United States and are designed to protect
against illegal and/or fraudulent activity. In opening an
account, consider the amount of personal information required.
Exchanges such as Bitstamp, GDAX, and Gemini have been
proactive in working with regulators to require more detailed
information on customers signing up for an account. Such
information can delay the opening of an account, often by a
couple of days. Those who feel that privacy is a benefit to
cryptoassets, which are supranational by nature, might avoid
exchanges that require this level of documentation. In general,
a higher level of regulation may benefit the consumer
protections of the investor and ensure the stability of an

exchange.
Does the Exchange Provide Insurance?
As the use of bitcoin and cryptoasset exchanges have grown,
there has also been the growth of insurance plans for
exchanges. One such insurer is Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance,
which offers loss protection to a number of exchanges.  Other
insurers are planning to enter this space as well, and it’s
beneficial for innovative investors to research whether the
exchange they choose has this insurance. Coinbase was one of
the first companies to offer insurance for its clients’ bitcoin
holdings, which includes the bitcoin in GDAX, the exchange it
operates.  In part, Coinbase is able to insure its clients’
bitcoin because it keeps less than 2 percent of customer funds
online; the rest is in highly secure offline storage.
HOT WALLET VERSUS COLD STORAGE
Let’s turn to the distinction between hot wallets and cold
storage, and why it’s important to understand both. The
acquisition and storage of cryptoassets are two separate
considerations. While exchanges, by default, will store the
assets they trade, that is not always the safest place to store the
asset long-term.
Cryptoassets are stored in either a hot wallet or cold
storage. The hot in hot wallet refers to the connection to the
Internet. A wallet is hot when it can be directly accessed
through the Internet or is on a machine that has an Internet
connection. If the innovative investor can access his or her
cryptoassets directly through a web browser, or through a
20
21
22
23

desktop or mobile application on a machine where that
machine is connected to the Internet, then it’s a hot wallet.
Cold storage, on the other hand, means the machine that
stores the cryptoasset is not connected to the Internet. In this
case, a hacker would have to physically steal the machine to
gain access to the cryptoassets. Some methods require that the
machine storing the cryptoasset has never touched the Internet.
Not once. While that sounds extreme, it is a best practice for
firms that store large amounts of cryptoassets. It is not
necessary for all but the most security-conscious investor.
What does it even mean to store a cryptoasset? This refers
to storage of the private key that allows the holder to send the
cryptoasset to another holder of a private key. A private key is
just a string of digits that unlocks a digital safe. The private
key allows for the holder of that key to mathematically prove
to the network that the holder is the owner of the cryptoasset
and can do with it as he or she likes.  That digital key can be
placed in a hot wallet or in cold storage, and there are a variety
of services that provide for such storage.
For both hot and cold storage, there are two options for
controlling the private key that the innovative investor can
choose from, creating a quadrant of four options in total
(Figure 14.1). Most exchanges, for example, take care of the
private key for the customer, so that all the customer has to do
is log into the exchange as with any typical website. These
exchanges qualify as a hot wallet where a third party controls
the private key. Services such as Coinbase provide cold
storage where a third party still controls the private key. In
situations where a third party controls the private key, often
the service doesn’t have a private key for each customer’s
24

assets. Instead, the service will have a few private keys that
secure a large number of clients’ assets, and those keys are
guarded very carefully.
Figure 14.1  The four quadrants of securing cryptoassets
If the innovative investor is reluctant to trust a third party,
the other option is to take control of the private keys directly.
While this comes with its own risks, like losing the private
key, if the proper precautions are taken, it ensures autonomy
and puts security directly in the owner’s hands.
CUSTODY VIA EXCHANGES
By default, exchanges must store a customer’s cryptoassets,
most commonly done by handling the private keys. We’ll

repeat, many exchanges don’t even have separate private keys
for different customers. The exchange has its own private keys
to the cryptoassets it is responsible for on the respective
blockchain and then has internal books that record the
customer balances. Depending on the exchange, there are
varying levels of security hygiene and different proportions of
the exchange’s assets that are kept in hot or cold storage. Over
time, these security distinctions have proven critical. For a
clearer understanding, we’ll cover a few big hacks that
occurred on bitcoin exchanges that stored 100 percent of their
bitcoin in hot wallets.
Let’s begin with the infamous Mt. Gox. While this
exchange did much to expand the usage and recognition of
bitcoin throughout the world, it met its end in early 2014
when the company declared bankruptcy after over $450
million  of client bitcoin holdings went missing. Although the
company was a pioneer in providing investors and enthusiasts
the opportunity to gain access more easily to bitcoin, Mt. Gox
also had weak management involved in an asset class that was
still in its infancy—never a good combination.
Jed McCaleb was the original owner of Mt. Gox. Early on
he learned that matching buyers and sellers of bitcoin was
more than he bargained for when wires for tens of thousands
of dollars started to pour in. McCaleb sold the site, and its
growing activity, to Mark Karpeles, who was known in chat
rooms as MagicalTux and enjoyed posting kitten videos
online. To his credit, Karpeles rewrote the site to address the
increased interest and activity, and he survived through the
early days when other bitcoin exchanges quickly folded.
Although he exhibited a level of coding competence,
25
26
27

Karpeles soon found himself out of his league when it came to
business. He was not investing in his company’s growth, and
his coding expertise soon showed cracks as well. A more
experienced technology shop would have implemented a test
environment and version control software for its code, which
was the backbone of Mt. Gox’s operation. Karpeles didn’t do
either, and all code changes were routed through him directly,
which created bottlenecks when changes were needed quickly.
While Karpeles may have been negligent in many facets of
the Mt. Gox business, he did understand the difference
between hot and cold storage of bitcoin. He put himself in
charge of all the private keys for the bitcoin the exchange
stored. After a hack in 2011, Karpeles decided to move the
majority of bitcoin offline into cold storage, which required
him to write down the private keys and place them in safety
deposit boxes throughout Tokyo, where the company was
located. This required a huge amount of paperwork and
accounting, which was clearly not a strong point for
Karpeles.  While the keys were in cold storage, Karpeles
claims that a hacker manipulated him through a transaction
malleability bug in the core Bitcoin software.  While
Karpeles’s claims have been called into question by many in
the bitcoin community, there’s no denying that the major
reason for this hack was due to poor security hygiene with
weak operational protocols put into place by the company for
the movement of bitcoin. Such negligence cost investors $450
million in bitcoin.
More recently, a hack of Bitfinex’s exchange cost investors
$72 million.  The hack was a result of Bitfinex storing 100
percent of its client assets in hot wallets. There is debate on
28
29
30

why Bitfinex did this. Possibly it was for purposes of liquidity,
as Bitfinex is one of the most liquid and active exchanges, or it
could have been a result of regulations put in place. Prior to
the hack, Bitfinex had settled with the CFTC for $75,000
primarily because its cold storage of bitcoin ran afoul of CFTC
regulations. The move to place all clients’ assets into hot
wallets is cited by many as due to the fine and CFTC
regulations.  Either way, this hack proved that no matter the
security protocols put in place, hot wallets are always more
insecure than properly executed cold storage because the hot
wallet can be accessed from afar by anyone with an Internet
connection. Only a physical break-in would allow a thief to
gain access to assets in cold storage.
At the time of the Mt. Gox hack, bitcoin and its underlying
technology was still in its infancy and experiencing growing
pains, like any other new technology. Famous venture
capitalist Fred Wilson wrote soon after the incident, “We are
witnessing the maturation of a sector and part of that will
inevitably be failures, crashes, and other messes. Almost every
technology that I’ve watched come into a mass adoption has
gone through these sorts of growing pains.”  Innovators and
early adopters of any new technology are taking risks, but the
exchanges are professionalizing over time. Mt. Gox is no
more; Bitfinex has restructured itself and is humming along.
These hacks have taught lessons not only to existing and new
cryptoasset exchanges, but to clients as well.
The exchanges that run the highest risk of being hacked are
those that have the largest amount of assets in hot wallets.
Cold storage might impact the ability to access assets quickly,
but what you lose in accessibility you gain in security.

THE WORLD OF CRYPTOASSET
WALLETS
Storing cryptoassets on an exchange may not always be the
safest option. The risk is lower for those exchanges that have
insurance, keep the majority of their assets in cold storage, and
employ other best-in-class security measures like penetration
testing and regular audits. For other exchanges, the risk should
only be tolerated if the innovative investor is trading regularly
and making use of the exchange’s capabilities, such as
offering newer cryptoassets. If not trading regularly, investors
should consider one of the following wallet options to store
their assets safely.
Broadly speaking, there are five kinds of wallets: web
(cloud), desktop, mobile, hardware, and paper. For the sake of
brevity, we use bitcoin to illustrate these examples as it
provides the scaffolding necessary to investigate similar
options for other cryptoassets.
The best resource for learning more about different kinds of
bitcoin wallets is bitcoin.org,  and we include additional
information sources in the Resources section of this book.
Recognize that as interest and access to more cryptoassets
continues to grow, the list of wallets to secure these assets will
grow, too.
Web Wallets
Most web wallets are not much different from exchanges. The
keys are often outside the investor’s control and in the hands
of a centralized third party. If the third party doesn’t employ
the proper security techniques, then the cryptoassets may be at
33

risk. As with an exchange, the web wallet can be accessed
from anywhere, which is one of the main benefits. Popular
web wallets include Blockchain.info and Coinbase. Some web
wallets do provide the option of controlling the private key,
which makes them like a lightweight desktop wallet (covered
below) that can be accessed remotely.
An increasingly prevalent feature in web wallets is
vaulting. A vault delays the withdrawal process of any
cryptoasset so that the holder has time to negate any attempted
withdrawal. This is primarily a tactic to thwart hackers who
may have compromised the user’s password and are trying to
move cryptoassets to another address. Coinbase has the most
well-known vaulting service within its web wallet.
CRYPTOASSET VAULTS
One of the nice features of Coinbase is that it allows a
customer to maintain an easily accessible balance of
bitcoin, as well as a more illiquid but highly secure form of
storage known as its Vault. Although placing bitcoin
balances into the Vault enhances security, it does require
two-factor authentication and time delays before
withdrawal. This means that moving funds from the Vault
takes 48 hours. Coinbase’s dual functionality is like having
a checking and a savings account at a bank. Bitcoin that
investors need to access quickly can be kept in a regular
Coinbase account (the checking account), and for added
security additional bitcoin can be held in a Vault account
(the savings account).
Desktop Wallets

With a desktop wallet, the private keys are stored directly on
the computer where the software is downloaded. The user has
full control, and no one else can lose, spend, or send his or her
bitcoin. There are two kinds of desktop wallets: a full client
and a lightweight client. When we say client, it simply refers
to the functionality of the software application that is running
on the computer. A full client is a much more intensive
software application, whereas a lightweight client provides a
more hassle-free approach to storing bitcoin.
In the early days of Bitcoin, there was only the wallet
associated with Satoshi’s software, which is now referred to as
Bitcoin Core. This wallet is a full client, meaning it requires a
full download of Bitcoin’s blockchain and therefore
substantial bandwidth and storage space. When a computer is
running this software, it is counted as a full node in Bitcoin’s
network, meaning it has a record of every single Bitcoin
transaction. Full nodes are great for security and autonomy
and are the backbone of propagating and verifying bitcoin
transactions, but the hardware requirements are only for the
most hardcore of hobbyists.
Lightweight clients, also referred to as thin clients, don’t
download Bitcoin’s entire blockchain, nor do they propagate
or verify new transactions being passed through the network.
Instead, they rely on full nodes for complete information on
Bitcoin’s blockchain, and are primarily focused on providing
transactional information involving only the user’s bitcoin. A
lightweight wallet is much more practical for the average user
who doesn’t have the means to deal with running a full client.
With these wallets, the private key(s) are on the computer on
which the software is downloaded. Popular lightweight clients
34

include Coinomi, Electrum, and Jaxx.
Mobile Wallets
Technically, we are referring to mobile wallets that store the
private keys on the device, as opposed to a third party’s
servers. Mobile wallets are similar to lightweight clients in
that they don’t download Bitcoin’s blockchain (it would break
the smartphone). Innovative investors can use them on the go
should they need to transfer bitcoin to friends to pay for dinner
at the local bar that accepts bitcoin for beers.
Numerous wallets appear on app stores as mobile
applications but are not technically mobile wallets. They are
web wallets that provide access through a mobile application.
The distinction boils down to who is storing the private keys.
If a third party is storing the private keys and the wallet is
accessing that information through the Internet, then that is a
web wallet even if it’s in the form of a mobile application.  If
the private keys are stored on the smartphone, then that mobile
application is a mobile wallet, as is the case for mobile wallets
such as Airbitz and Breadwallet.
Hardware Wallets
As bitcoin has become more popular and widely used,
companies have sprung up that create dedicated hardware for
storing private keys, and thereby storing and sending bitcoin
or cryptoassets to others. Several hardware wallets provide a
variety of functionality. Some offer a full suite of key
generation, storage, and sending capabilities; others are simply
used as an extra layer of transaction confirmation security;
others still need to be plugged into a computer to work. A few
35

of the more popular wallets are as follows:
•   Trezor. This is one of the more secure ways to store
bitcoin, as it generates private keys that never leave the
device. This protects the data from viruses and malware
that may impact other devices or online storage.
•   Ledger Nano S. This device plugs into a USB port and
allows for the storage of bitcoin, ether, and other
altcoins. It has a neat OLED display on what looks like
a flash drive that provides confirmation when a
transaction takes place on the device.
•   KeepKey. This USB device not only securely stores
bitcoin but also provides information on transactions
and confirmations on its OLED display. It is also PIN-
protected.
While a hardware wallet can always be misplaced, all is not
necessarily lost if that happens. During the initialization stage
of setting up the hardware wallet there is a seed, which is like
a backup password. That seed needs to be stored in an
extremely secure place because if the hardware wallet ever
goes missing, the seed will regenerate the private keys that
were on the hardware wallet and enable access to the bitcoin
again.
Since hardware wallets require specific hardware
engineering and associated software engineering, they often
don’t support a wide array of cryptoassets. Most hardware
wallets support bitcoin. The Ledger Nano S provides support
to some cryptoassets beyond bitcoin, and KeepKey is now
integrating with ShapeShift to support additional
cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin.  We’re sure to see this

space grow over the next few years as more hardware wallets
expand their capabilities to support various cryptoassets.
Paper Wallets
One of the simplest ways of storing private keys is also one of
the most secure, if done properly. Welcome to the paper
wallet, which involves writing the long alphanumeric string
that is the public-private key pair on a piece of paper. A paper
wallet qualifies as a form of cold storage. The paper wallet can
be locked away in a safe for decades, and so long as the
specific asset’s blockchain continues to exist, that private key
can be used to access it. Paper wallets support all cryptoassets
because all they require are pen and paper. Many store these in
a fireproof safe deposit box or an equally secure location.
MANY CHOICES, SAME DISCIPLINES
With all the available choices, it’s vital that investors do their
due diligence when choosing the wallets and exchanges that
best suit their needs. The basic progression will be “how to
acquire” and “how to store” the cryptoasset, and while the
same service can provide both functions, it’s useful to consider
what is most important before making a decision. Just as an
investor would take the time to consider which financial
advisor to use, the innovative investor must take time to
investigate which cryptoasset “acquirer and storer” to use.
We recognize that the world of cryptoassets requires new
habit patterns, an often uncomfortable process, especially
when money (in any form, digital or paper) is at stake. As the
visibility and marketplace grows for cryptoassets, options will

materialize that don’t require new habit patterns because they
will incorporate cryptoassets into the investment systems and
vehicles with which the investor is already familiar. We’re
seeing money managers, investment firms, and other capital
market players step into the fray to investigate and create
investment vehicles that fit the mold of capital market assets
and can be housed in brokerage accounts, and potentially even
401(k) plans.
In the next chapter, we explore the growing capital market
investment choices available to investors. These still require
due diligence, discipline, and research, but they do away with
the potentially scary components of private key storage and
setting up new accounts with startups.

Chapter 15
“Where’s the Bitcoin ETF?”
uying cryptoassets through a dedicated cryptoasset exchange is
a direct avenue for investors to gain access to this new asset
class, but it does require orienting with a new application and
user interface, as well as trusting in what might be a young
business.
There is a benefit to incorporating cryptoassets directly into
the interface you use to manage a preexisting investment
portfolio, where prices can be tracked easily, asset allocation
models can be more carefully monitored, and tax benefits can
be leveraged. In this chapter, we discuss various capital market
vehicles that can give the innovative investor access to
cryptoassets through established investment channels, as well
as what may be available in the future. We also discuss what
the innovative investor should expect from financial advisors
as this space continues to grow.
BITCOIN INVESTMENT TRUST
Grayscale Investments offers the largest capital markets
vehicle with bitcoin exposure, clocking in at north of $200

million or roughly 1 percent of all bitcoin outstanding as of
March 2017. Grayscale was established in 2013 by its parent
company, Digital Currency Group (DCG). Founded by Barry
Silbert, a serial entrepreneur and influential figure in the
Bitcoin community, some would say that DCG is in the early
stages of becoming the Berkshire Hathaway of Bitcoin.
Grayscale’s focus within DCG’s portfolio of operating
companies is to provide digital currency investing options to
the capital markets. Currently, it has the Bitcoin Investment
Trust (BIT), the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Investment Trust,
and a potential bitcoin ETF (exchange traded fund) in filing
with the SEC.
The BIT was the first product that Grayscale brought to
market and upon launch was only available to accredited
investors. The BIT was structured to acquire and secure
bitcoin in a trust and then provide shares in the trust to
investors, with each share representing approximately 1/10 the
value of a single bitcoin. In theory, investors could assume
that every 10 shares would be backed by a single bitcoin.  No
hedging or leverage is used in the trust; it simply holds bitcoin
and allows investors to gain access to its price fluctuations
without having to deal with the underlying asset. The bitcoin
itself is stored with Xapo, a firm that specializes in the secure
custody of large amounts of bitcoin.  On its website,
Grayscale advertises the following about the BIT:
•   Titled, auditable ownership through a traditional
investment vehicle
•   Eligibility for tax-advantaged accounts
•   Publicly quoted
•   Supported by a network of trusted service providers
1
2
3
4

•   Robust security and storage
These services come with a management fee of 2 percent
annually. After a holding period of one year, investors can sell
their shares in the OTCQX markets under the symbol GBTC.
Through this process, accredited investors can exit their initial
investment, realizing any profits or losses, and in so doing
give all levels of investors access to their liquidated shares of
the BIT. Other investors can buy GBTC through their
stockbroker of choice, whether that be Fidelity or other firms.
SELF-DIRECTED IRA
One of the lesser-known options for investors seeking
retirement-based investments is the self-directed IRA.
While it has been in place since the creation of IRAs in
1974, what distinguishes it from the traditional IRA is the
variety of investment options available. Most people use
an IRA to invest in equities, bonds, mutual funds, and cash
equivalents such as money market instruments. With a
self-directed IRA, an investor can go beyond these
investments to include such assets as real estate and gold.
This structure provides a level of flexibility for investors
that allows for the inclusion of various alternative, often
riskier, assets into an investment account. This flexibility
requires numerous additional rules. One such rule is that
any investment in this account can’t benefit the account
owner “indirectly.” For example, an indirectly beneficial
investment in a self-directed IRA would be the use of
funds to buy a vacation home or other piece of real estate
that the account owner would use personally.  These
accounts often come with costly maintenance and
5
6

management fees, so while they are useful, they require
proper due diligence and care.
The second leg of the BIT wasn’t always available. In early
May 2015, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) gave Grayscale the regulatory approval needed to
allow the BIT to become a publicly traded vehicle on
OTCQX.  On May 4, 2015, the very first accredited investors
who had bought into the BIT were given the option to sell
their shares of GBTC in the OTCQX market.  The first trade
was for 2 shares of GBTC at $44/share. Through the entire day
there were just 765 shares traded, or just over 75 bitcoin.
Admittedly a thin market, but this day in May was the first
time a bitcoin vehicle was traded on a regulated U.S. capital
market.
Through the first quarter of 2017, there is plenty of reason
to be excited about the BIT and GBTC,  but they are far from
perfect vehicles. Grayscale’s creativity in allowing accredited
investors to buy into a one-year lockup before selling in public
markets does have a drawback. Unlike ETFs or mutual funds,
which can issue more shares to meet market demand,
Grayscale is not able to issue more shares of GBTC to meet
investor demand. Instead, the creation of new units of GBTC
is entirely dependent on accredited investors being willing to
sell their shares, which they can only do after one year.
Furthermore, now that Grayscale has an S-1 filing under
review with the SEC they are not able to create more shares of
the BIT for accredited investors that would like to buy into the
private placement.
Meanwhile, the price of GBTC can be bid up or down,
depending on what people were willing to pay for access to
7
8
9

these shares. The first trade for GBTC was at $44/share, and
each share maps to roughly 1/10 of a bitcoin. So $44/share
would imply that bitcoin was in the $440 range. Instead, at the
time of the trade for $44/share, bitcoin was in the low $200s.
Someone was willing to pay nearly a 100 percent premium to
get access to bitcoin as an investment without having to deal
with all the nitty-gritty explained in the prior chapter. Figure
15.1 shows how GBTC has differed from its net asset value
(NAV) over time. (NAV is the true value of the bitcoin
underlying the shares. Anytime the gray line is above the black
line means that GBTC is trading at a premium to the
underlying value of the shares.)
Figure 15.1  GBTC’s NAV compared to its price
Source: https://grayscale.co/bitcoin-investment-trust/#market-performance
It’s clear that GBTC has traded well above its net asset
value for much of its short life. Different explanations exist for

this, such as that GBTC now allows everyday investors to put
bitcoin exposure directly into their traditional portfolios or
retirement accounts, and institutional investors can also easily
buy GBTC. Whatever the reason, it is a sign that investors are
interested in gaining bitcoin exposure in their portfolios. As of
March 2017, the most common method to do this through a
capital market vehicle is with GBTC, and therefore the
premium is the price one must pay for such access.
Additionally, some argue the premium is worth the ability to
enjoy the benefits of bitcoin’s price appreciation while
providing tax reporting flexibility. However, at its core, GBTC
has a supply-demand problem. New units of freely traded
GBTC can only be created when accredited investors choose
to exit their initial investment in the BIT, and there is no
requirement to ever do so. Thus, as demand builds, the supply
to match the demand isn’t always there.
Some may initially see GBTC as an ETF, and therefore
wonder why so much drama has unfolded around a “bitcoin
ETF.” However, the BIT and GBTC are a far cry from an
ETF, both in the regulatory approval they have been granted
and in the operational complexity. ETFs are constructed so
that the value 235of the shares stay close to the net asset value.
Keeping shares close to NAV avoids the sizeable premiums
like those which GBTC investors must endure. Furthermore,
an ETF requires sign-off from the SEC. While the BIT is a
step in the right direction, many steps remain before an SEC-
approved ETF will be available to investors.
THE WINKLEVOSS TWINS AND THE
BITCOIN ETF RACE

Upon inception of the BIT, Grayscale was the only provider of
a bitcoin-based capital market investment vehicle in the
United States, but others were interested in getting a piece of
the action. Little did Grayscale know it would have
competition from former Olympic rowers and near-founders of
Facebook. Perhaps best known for their involvement with the
latter, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are two well-to-do
investors. They claimed to be the originators of the idea for
Facebook, which led to a $60-million settlement with Mark
Zuckerberg. Since much of that settlement was in shares, its
present-day equivalent is in the hundreds of millions.
However, the twins were not about to disappear into
oblivion with their millions; they had tasted greatness and
were not the kind of figures who easily faded from the
limelight. Eager for new ventures, Bitcoin provided just the
opportunity. They were introduced to the idea of Bitcoin in
2012 by David Azar while vacationing in Ibiza,  putting them
well ahead of the informational curve. The twins were smitten
with the concept and started buying the currency hand over
fist, including investing in bitcoin-based startups.
At one point in 2013, they reported owning about 1 percent
of all bitcoin in existence (at the time, well over 100,000
bitcoin).  Cameron has been credited with buying the bitcoin
that first pushed the currency’s total network value over $1
billion.  Seeing the opportunity, he placed a bid for bitcoin at
$91.26 or above on Mt. Gox, the precise price that would
make bitcoin’s total network value greater than $1 billion.
The twins weren’t satisfied with being passive investors;
they wanted to bring products to market. To that end, in July
2013, they filed an SEC Form S-1 for the Winklevoss Bitcoin
10
11
12

Trust, which they intended to list as an ETF under the ticker
COIN.  Typical S-1s are often 100 pages or more and cover
every imaginable detail of a product. By writing an S-1 for a
bitcoin product, the Winkelvoss twins signaled their
seriousness.
An ETF is arguably the best investment vehicle to house
bitcoin. It has a transparent and low fee schedule and has an
internal structure that keeps the ETF close to the net asset
value, while providing an investor with an easy way to trade it
during the market day. Furthermore, the twins saw the SEC
approval as the holy grail for winning investor confidence, and
thereby taking bitcoin to the mainstream. While an admirable
idea, they would soon find this path was longer than they
likely expected.
By the start of 2017, the Winkelvoss twins were still
waiting to get an ETF approved. In the interim, they had made
amendment after amendment to their S-1, consulted with too
many lawyers to count, and even started their own cryptoasset
exchange, known as Gemini.
GEMINI EXCHANGE
Creating an ETF was not the only bitcoin product the
Winklevoss brothers were working on. In 2015, they
launched their own cryptoasset exchange called Gemini.
The twins followed the proper regulatory path and worked
to secure licensing from the New York Department of
Financial Services. Although a lengthy process, as of
March 2017 their exchange was one of two companies in
the space that was a limited liability trust company,
making it regulated similarly to a bank. The twins were
13

inspired to create this exchange in response to concerns
from the SEC over the lack of regulated exchanges.
Approaching March 10, 2017, all eyes were on the
Winkelvoss ETF, as the SEC was required to make a decision
on a 19b-4 filing the twins had submitted, which was a
necessary step to listing an ETF. The prospect of a bitcoin
ETF being approved gripped the cryptoasset community. An
approval would not only be one of the greatest regulatory wins
for the budding asset class, but would also require a large
amount of bitcoin to be sourced to meet the demand of capital
market investors buying the ETF.  In a research report
published early in January 2017, analyst Spencer Bogart, at the
time with Needham & Company, wrote, “We think the listing
of a bitcoin ETF would have a profound effect on the price of
bitcoin. Conservatively, we estimate that a bitcoin ETF could
attract $300 million in assets in its first week and the resulting
effort to source the underlying bitcoin for the Trust would
likely drive the price of bitcoin up significantly.”
Prior to the decision, the price of bitcoin rose in
anticipation of this surge in demand. Although those with the
greatest understanding of cryptoassets and the capital markets
doubted the product would get approved,  the price of bitcoin
hit a new high before the decision. On March 10, at an SEC
event totally unrelated to Bitcoin known as the Evidence
Summit, an SEC employee made a public comment: “I will
say that, for people that are emailing in, we have nothing to
say about bitcoin, so please stop asking.”  Clearly, the entire
community was hungry for news on this decision.
Later that day, the SEC denied approval to the Winklevoss
ETF.  Following is the key part of that ruling:
14
15
16
17
18

The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it
does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a
national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and
manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public
interest. The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an
exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded
products (“ETPs”) must, in addition to other applicable requirements,
satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the
exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant
markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that
commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.
Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the
significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, as the Exchange
has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of
surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all
previously approved commodity-trust ETPs—agreements that help address
concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and
practices in this market—the Commission does not find the proposed rule
change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.
The two big takeaways were that the SEC decided the markets
for bitcoin were “unregulated” and that there were not
sufficient “surveillance-sharing agreements” between Bats
Exchange—the exchange where the bitcoin ETF would list—
and the cryptoasset exchanges where bitcoin for the ETF
would be sourced.
Regardless of what people expected going into the SEC
decision, most everyone was taken aback by the rigidity of the
SEC’s rejection. Notably, the SEC didn’t spend much time on
the specifics of the Winkelvoss ETF but focused more on the
overarching nature of the bitcoin markets. Saying that these
markets were unregulated was an extra slap to the
Winkelvosses, who had spent significant time and money on
setting up the stringently regulated Gemini exchange. In
focusing on the bitcoin markets at large, the rejection implied

that an ETF will not happen in the United States for some
time.
Immediately following the SEC decision not to approve the
ETF, which was released just after 4 p.m. EST on a Friday,
bitcoin dropped from $1,250 to below $1,000, an over 20
percent drop in a matter of minutes. It quickly rallied back
toward $1,100. The incident allowed the naysayers to write
their “I told you so” and “Bitcoin is dead” commentaries once
again. The Wall Street Journal decided to enlighten its readers
over the weekend with an article on the SEC decision titled,
“Let’s Be Real: Bitcoin Is a Useless Investment.”
When these bloggers and commentators returned to their
desks on Monday, they found that investors on the 24/7
cryptoasset exchanges had been working over the weekend.
On Monday, naysarers were faced with the reality that bitcoin
was once again back over $1,200, and the network value for
all cryptoassets had increased $4 billion since the SEC
decision. Yes, $4 billion in three days.
The Winkelvoss ETF was not the first bitcoin ETF the SEC
rejected. In July 2016, SolidX Partners filed with the SEC for
the SolidX Bitcoin Trust ETF, with the intention of listing it
on the NYSE under the ticker XBTC.  A major difference
between SolidX and the Winkelvoss product was that SolidX
aimed to insure its trust for up to $125 million against any
theft or hack of bitcoin. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the
SolidX ETF.
ARK INVEST AND BITCOIN EXPOSURE IN ETFS
As of March 2017 there were two ETFs that offered
bitcoin exposure, ARK Invest’s Next Generation Internet
19
20

ETF (ARKW) as well as its overall Innovation ETF
(ARKK). Both combine bitcoin exposure with a portfolio
of growth stocks, and have been some of the highest
performing ETFs in the market. Using Grayscale’s BIT,
ARK Invest became the first public fund manager to invest
in bitcoin in September of 2015, and as of this writing still
has the only ETFs on the market with bitcoin exposure.
Given ARK’s focus on fast-moving technologies like
machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and genomics,
investing in bitcoin was a natural fit for the firm.
THE ETN OPTION
Outside of the United States, more options for capital market-
based bitcoin products exist, such as two exchange traded
notes (ETN) offered by XBT Provider on Nasdaq Nordic in
Stockholm, Sweden. Nasdaq Nordic is a regulated exchange
system that is a subsidiary of the well-known Nasdaq in the
United States. To list on Nasdaq Nordic, these products had to
surmount a significant number of regulatory hurdles. Notably,
these ETNs had been approved by Sweden’s Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA), a government agency
overseeing financial regulation in Sweden.
While ETNs are exchange traded, just as ETFs are, one is a
note and the other is a fund. The easiest way to sum up the
difference is that an ETN gives the investor a digital note that
promises the investor will get paid depending on the asset’s
performance, while an ETF actually holds the assets and
thereby tracks its value on the market.
In technical terms, ETNs are senior unsecured debt

instruments that track a market index or benchmark. An ETN
provides investors with exposure to an asset without the
issuers of the ETN having to own the assets. Since an ETN is a
debt instrument, investors are then subject to the credit quality
of the issuer. If the issuer goes bankrupt, then investors in the
ETN may get only a fraction of what they invested in the ETN,
whereas with an ETF the fund holds the underlying assets.
Therefore, investors in an ETN must have faith in the issuer’s
ability to continue to operate, as well as the issuer’s ability to
track an index without necessarily owning the basket of assets
that make up the index.
Issuers of ETNs are usually a bank or financial firm that
backs the instrument with its credibility and serves to quell
concerns regarding the financial strength of the issuer. Morgan
Stanley was the initial issuer of this type of security, and
Barclays is also a frequent issuer, both well-diversified
international banks with solid ratings. However, as we learned
from the crisis of 2008, recognizing and evaluating the
underwriting firm is critical, and not always so easy to do.
As a debt instrument, the health and well-being of the
underlying issuer is the added risk that the innovative investor
possesses when owning an ETN.
As with ETFs, ETNs allow investors to integrate exposure
of an asset into their portfolio without having to deal with the
messy details of acquiring and securing that asset. For
instance, if an investor believes in commodity futures like live
cattle, but doesn’t want to get involved with trading the actual
futures contracts, he or she can invest in an ETN that tracks
that futures index. The issuer of that ETN is responsible for
delivering the value of that index (minus fees) to the investor
21

upon maturity or early repurchase. Because the ETN trades on
an exchange, it’s susceptible to market forces and can trade at
a premium or discount to its underlying value.  Trading on an
exchange also allows for liquidity, so an investor can easily
buy or sell. ETNs can also be held in standard brokerage or
custodial accounts.
In October 2015, XBT Provider issued Bitcoin Tracker One
(COINXBT) to track the USD price of bitcoin.  Bitcoin
Tracker One takes the average USD exchange rate of bitcoin
from the Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and GDAX exchanges to
determine the underlying value of bitcoin for the investment.
The following year, XBT Provider issued the Bitcoin Tracker
Euro. Both investments were made available through the
Interactive Brokers platform, a discount broker service
available to investors.
For these products, XBT Provider charges a 2.5 percent
management fee, 25 percent higher than the fee Grayscale
charges. Perhaps most important for the innovative investor,
unlike many ETNs, XBT Provider is at all times fully hedged,
meaning it holds the underlying bitcoin equal to the value of
the ETN. This can significantly reduce reliance on XBT
Provider’s credit quality because even if the company goes
bankrupt there should still be the underlying bitcoin in place to
reimburse investors. As stated on the website, “XBT Provider
do[es] not have any market risk. The company always holds
bitcoins equivalent to the value of ETNs issued.”
In mid-2016, XBT Provider was purchased by Global
Advisors (Jersey) Limited (GABI) after XBT Provider’s main
stockholder, KnCMiner, declared bankruptcy. KnCMiner had
long been a bitcoin mining company and producer of bitcoin
22
23
24
25
26

mining rigs. With an ETN the credibility of the underlying
issuer is paramount, and GABI recognized that as well.
Following KnC’s bankruptcy, trading of XBT Provider’s two
ETNs temporarily paused as a new guarantor was pursued,
with GABI ultimately coming to the rescue.
The GABI team is led by Jean-Marie Mognetti and Daniel
Masters, who cut their teeth as commodities traders at Lehman
Brothers and JPMorgan respectively. They bring considerable
capital markets experience to the bitcoin space. Prior to
purchasing XBT Provider, GABI had created a bitcoin fund
intended for institutional investors called the GABI.  The
fund is domiciled in Jersey, United Kingdom, an area known
for its innovative approach to regulation, similar to the
Cayman Islands. By purchasing XBT Provider, GABI
strengthened the reliability of the counterparty to the bitcoin
ETNs and added a nice asset to its growing bitcoin investing
platform for institutions. The rationale was summed up by
Masters: “Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) is
the only fully regulated Bitcoin investment fund targeting
institutions and in adding XBT we are addressing the online
retail and professional markets.”
THE ETI OPTION
Another bitcoin investment vehicle for investors is the
exchange traded instrument (ETI). ETIs are similar to ETFs in
that they are asset-backed securities, whereas an ETN doesn’t
have to be backed by the underlying asset. However, ETIs are
much less common and are primarily intended to house
alternative investments such as futures or options.

In July 2016, a bitcoin ETI was listed on the Gibraltar
Stock Exchange under the symbol BTCETI.  It charges a
1.75 percent management fee, placing it below both Grayscale
and XBT Provider, and custodies its assets with Coinbase.
While the sponsor and arranger of the ETI—Revoltura and
Argentarius ETI Management Limited—are not well known,
what is notable is the involvement of the government of
Gibraltar and Gibraltar’s regulator, the Financial Services
Commission.
It is clear that Gibraltar sees an opportunity and is making a
play for itself as a virtual currency hub. Albert Isola,
Gibraltar’s Minister for Financial Services and Gaming, said,
“We continue to work with the private sector and our regulator
on an appropriate regulatory environment for operators in the
digital currency space, and the launch of this ETI on our stock
exchange demonstrates our ability to be innovative and deliver
speed to market.”
In the same month as Gibraltar’s bitcoin ETI
announcement, a Swiss issuer called Vontobel announced a
tracker certificate for bitcoin that appears to operate like an
ETN, though the details are sparse. July 2016 was a busy
month for capital markets-focused bitcoin products, but
represents only the beginning of what we expect to see as the
years roll on.
CAN AN INVESTOR FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRICING OF
CRYPTOASSETS?
As the innovative investor may have noticed, many of the
31
32

exchange-traded products listed above rely on price indices.
While a price index sounds simple, it can be a complex
mathematical process to assess the exact price the market is
offering, especially for cryptoassets that trade globally and can
be purchased through a wide array of fiat currencies and
cryptoassets. However, pricing is important for the future
growth of capital market vehicles holding cryptoassets, so it is
an area of development that the innovative investor should
watch.
The pricing problem is particularly acute for bitcoin that
trades in different geographies and with different fiat currency
pairs. Currently, the operations of different cryptoasset
exchanges can be thought of as isolated liquidity pools, so if
one exchange is experiencing significantly stronger demand
than other exchanges, the bitcoin on that exchange may trade
at a premium to other exchanges. In the equities markets, such
differences in price would quickly be solved by arbitrage, but
due to time delays in moving bitcoin between different
exchanges, not to mention fiat currency capital controls, these
pricing discrepancies persist.
The combination of growing interest in bitcoin and
recognition of the need for robust and regulated bitcoin indices
has led two major investment markets, the NYSE and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), to implement their own
bitcoin indices. The NYSE launched its bitcoin pricing index,
NYXBT, in May 2015.  At the time, the president of the
NYSE, Thomas Farley, said, “Bitcoin values are quickly
becoming a data point that our customers want to follow as
they consider transacting, trading, or investing with this
emerging asset class. As a global index leader and
33

administrator of ICE LIBOR, ICE Futures U.S. Dollar Index,
and many other notable benchmarks, we are pleased to bring
transparency to this market.”
The NYBXT methodology utilizes data-based rules that
produce what they feel is an “objective and fair value for one
bitcoin.” The index initially began by taking data from
Coinbase, in which the NYSE had a minority investment,
though it has since branched out to include other exchanges.
In the latter part of 2016, the CME Group also launched its
own bitcoin price indices with the CME CF Bitcoin Reference
Rate and the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index.  It also
created an independent advisory committee, including bitcoin
evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos to oversee its pricing model,
which utilized prices from various exchanges throughout the
world.  Many have speculated that this index could be the
precursor to bitcoin futures and other derivatives products,
which is CME Group’s specialty.
We commonly use the Tradeblock index, XBX, which is a
leading bitcoin index for institutional traders of bitcoin to get
the most accurate price of the asset throughout a trading day.
Intended for institutional investor use, the index derives a
price for bitcoin using algorithms that account for market
liquidity, manipulation attempts, and other anomalies that
occur throughout the global exchanges.
While all of the aforementioned indices are bitcoin-focused,
we expect to see many indices focused on other maturing
cryptoassets appear. This will foreshadow more capital market
vehicles to come.
TALKING TO A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

ABOUT CRYPTOASSETS
David Berger, creator of the Digital Currency Council,
believes the time has come for financial advisors to be able to
discuss bitcoin and cryptoassets as they relate to their clients’
portfolios. “Advisers need to understand the technological
underpinnings of Bitcoin, as well as how to hold, securely
store, and utilize it. Advisers also need to understand the
digital-currency ecosystem and the ways to evaluate risk and
invest wisely within that ecosystem. They should familiarize
themselves with the financial and tax implications, as well as
the legal and regulatory issues—all of which are developing
daily.”
Currently, GBTC is available for typical investors through
brokerage firms. With an online and self-directed investment
account, investors should be able to get a quote on GBTC and
buy the asset for their accounts.
For investors with an advisor at a wealth management firm,
placing the order for GBTC may require interfacing with your
advisor so the firm can make the purchase. It won’t be
uncommon to get some pushback due to a lack of awareness
related to this investment vehicle from financial advisors,
whether they’re independent or from a wirehouse. At this
point, innovative investors should recognize that bitcoin and
other cryptoassets can have a positive impact on their
investment portfolios. Financial advisors and investment firms
would be well served to be knowledgeable, informed, and
open to discuss these investment vehicles appropriately with
clients.
Fortunately, the financial services industry is warming to
these investments and the need to bring advisors up to speed.

In 2014, the Financial Planning Association (FPA) produced a
report clearly detailing its take on the matter titled, “The Value
of Bitcoin in Enhancing the Efficiency of an Investor’s
Portfolio.”  The FPA supports financial advisors and others
associated with the Certified Financial Planner™ (CFP™)
certification. In the report it asserted that, for many investors,
bitcoin could provide a potential opportunity to diversify and
boost their portfolios.
Although we expect that advisors will increasingly become
aware of and knowledgeable about bitcoin and cryptoasset
investments, the innovative investor may encounter an
immediate dismissal, a sense of curiosity, some level of
knowledge, or perhaps just a chuckle from his or her advisor
on the topic. Given this, here are some points to consider:
1.   A good advisor is truly looking out for his or her
clients. Bitcoin and cryptoassets are new and have
short and volatile track records, so the adviser’s
immediate negative reaction or dismissal shouldn’t be
a refutation of his or her quality as an advisor.
2.   Investors should be prepared to provide links and
resources to educate the advisor. The Resources
section in the back of this book can be a big help.
3.   Remind the advisor that it’s not about putting
everything in these investments, and his or her advice
can help identify where these assets may
appropriately fit in the asset allocation model the
advisor has built. (If there’s no asset allocation model
or financial plan the advisor can reference, that should
be a red flag for the investor.)
41

4.   If the advisor doesn’t believe in these assets, or
refuses to invest in them on the innovative investor’s
behalf, the asset can be purchased directly as outlined
in Chapter 14 or by purchasing GBTC through a self-
directed account. If the investor takes this route, we
highly recommend informing the advisor of this
investment so the advisor can include it in his or her
records as reference for the advisor’s asset allocation
plans. Good advisors should be open to keeping
records of client assets held away from their firm.
5.   If the financial advisor is a deer in the headlights on
the topic, hand him or her a copy of this book.
INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISORS VERSUS WIREHOUSE
ADVISORS
Ric Edelman, one of America’s top financial advisors,
agrees with Berger. Edelman is an author and speaker, and
has been named America’s top independent financial
advisor three times by Barron’s magazine. Now we can
add bitcoin believer to the list. “It’s important that
investors stay aware and knowledgeable about bitcoin,”
Edelman says. Beyond bitcoin, Edelman sees great
potential in blockchain technology as a solution for many
businesses that he believes “can benefit from
advancements made in this technology.”
Edelman’s attitude as an adviser may be unique, and
one reason may be because he’s an independent financial
advisor, which is different from a wirehouse-based
financial advisor who works at Wells Fargo, Morgan
Stanley, or Merrill Lynch. Wirehouse advisors may have
42

more constraints on their ability to recommend investment
vehicles related to bitcoin or cryptoassets. This may be due
to those firms having internal policies that keep their
advisors from recommending products that haven’t been
fully evaluated by their own internal research teams or
simply by a lack of knowledge and interest in these assets
as investment vehicles.
WHAT’S NEXT?
We believe that cryptoasset investment vehicles will continue
to proliferate, broadening exposure to even the most
conservative investors who will eventually realize the
uncorrelated value add of this new asset class. Even though the
SEC didn’t approve the Winklevoss or SolidX ETFs, we
believe international regulators will continue to explore this
innovative new asset class, which ultimately may help to raise
the SEC’s comfort level with bitcoin and cryptoassets. That
said, the SEC’s priority is consumer protection, and if it feels
there are still not enough consumer protections in place for
bitcoin and other cryptoassets, then it has no obligation to
approve any exchange-traded products.
Globally, securitization efforts will continue around bitcoin,
which will open the door for other cryptoassets that hold true
merit, like ether, to be incorporated into capital market
vehicles. Grayscale has moved forward with the Ethereum
Classic (ETC) Investment Trust, which operates similarly to
the BIT but holds ether classic, not to be confused with the
much larger asset, ether.
Ultimately, we see a future in which there will be numerous

options to invest in capital market vehicles that securitize
cryptoassets. For example, we expect there to be multiasset
mutual funds with cryptoassets used for diversification.
Similar to REX Share’s S&P 500 gold-hedged ETF, we may
someday have a S&P 500 bitcoin-hedged ETF. Similarly, we
will likely have funds of cryptoassets based on their
functionality, such as a cryptocommodity fund, or perhaps a
fund of the privacy focused cryptocurrencies like monero,
dash, and zcash. Lastly, given the growing trend of indexation,
as the cryptoasset space matures significantly, we could see
network value weighted cryptoasset ETFs, including
potentially a basket of the top 5, 10, or 20 cryptoassets.
In the last two chapters, we discussed how the innovative
investor can gain access to bitcoin and cryptoassets from a
wide range of vehicles, including mining, direct purchases
from exchanges, and capital market investments like GBTC
and its kin. Another exciting part of the cryptoasset world for
the innovative investor includes the ability to get involved
directly with the developer teams, launching cryptoassets from
the beginning. In the past, this world was open only to the
wealthy, but with new trends such as crowdfunding, token
launches, and innovative regulation via the JOBS Act,
opportunities exist for innovative investors of all shapes and
sizes to get involved.

Chapter 16
The Wild World of ICOs
uring the early tech days, innovators such as Steve Jobs, Bill
Gates, and Michael Dell became iconic figures who had turned
ideas into multibillion-dollar businesses. Over the last decade,
we’ve seen visionaries such as Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and
Mark Zuckerberg do the same. These innovators changed the
world because people believed in their visions, and these early
believers invested money to turn their ideas into reality. While
these investments brought great benefit, they were not based
on altruism; initial investors were looking to get a sizable
return on their risky investments.
Investing in early stage, private companies is most often
referred to as venture capital. The term itself conveys the risk
involved. After all, venture as a verb conveys a journey into
the unknown, and capital refers to wealth and resources.
Venture capital is just that: risking the unknown in the pursuit
of outsized rewards, but knowing all along that the probability
of failure is high.
Venture capital is a relatively young industry, intimately
entwined with Silicon Valley. While Silicon Valley made
venture capital the famous industry it is today, venture capital

made Silicon Valley. One of the earliest and most widely
recognized companies that helped jump-start the venture
capital industry was Intel, which today produces the chips in
most of our computers. The company was started in Santa
Clara, California, by well-known and highly regarded
scientists, Gordon E. Moore (famous for creating “Moore’s
Law” ) and Robert Noyce (cocreator of the integrated circuit),
but they were hard-pressed to raise money for their new
company. Ultimately, Intel found a benefactor in Arthur Rock
—an American financier who coined the term venture
capitalist —who helped them raise $2.5 million in convertible
debentures that included $10,000 from his own pocket.  The
company went public two years later in 1970, raising $6.8
million and providing significant rewards to Rock and those
who bought the debentures. Intel was one of the first
companies to utilize venture capital as a method of funding its
startup, and due to its success, helped pioneer the concept in
Silicon Valley.
Despite the relative youth of venture capital, many
cryptoasset firms are now turning the model on its head. The
disruptors are in danger of being disrupted. For the innovative
investor, it’s key to realize that cryptoassets are not only
making it easier for driven entrepreneurs to raise money,
they’re also creating opportunities for the average investor to
get into the earliest rounds of what could be the next Facebook
or Uber. Welcome to the colliding worlds of crowdfunding
and cryptoassets.
THE OLD METHOD: THE INVESTOR’S
PERSPECTIVE
1

Up until recently, the first opportunity the average investor
had to invest in a company was upon its initial public offering
(IPO), when the company’s shares began trading on a well-
known exchange like the Nasdaq or NYSE. However, leading
up to an IPO, the company had likely gone through numerous
rounds of private funding. As a private company grows, there
are different names for each investing round, starting with a
seed round before moving to a Series A, B, C, D, and so on. In
each of these rounds, when investors put money into the
company, they typically receive a percentage of that company,
which is expressed in shares. Such funding is usually open
only to venture capitalists, other private equity investors, or
wealthy individuals. An IPO converts those private shares into
public shares, which are then traded on a public exchange that
the everyday investor can get access to.
As the innovative investor can probably infer, the earliest
rounds, when the risks are highest, are often the most
profitable rounds for an investor if the company succeeds. On
one hand, keeping these rounds shielded from the public
protects the average citizen from the inherent risks of these
early stages of investing, but on the other, it also excludes
them from the opportunity. Compounding the issue, over the
last decade companies have been waiting longer and longer to
go public, which places more and more of the returns in the
private markets.
Ben Evans, an analyst at Andreessen Horowitz—one of the
most famous venture capital firms in the world—published a
report in 2015 that clearly laid out the value shift toward
private markets. The median time for a tech company to IPO
in 1999 was four years, whereas in 2014 it was 11 years,4

meaning the average investor now has to wait nearly three
times as long to get access to company shares. Although
there’s less enthusiasm for IPOs than there was during the tech
boom, much of the delay is due to regulatory changes as a
result of that tech and telecom boom, as well as the financial
crisis of 2008. In the late 1990s, companies used to IPO with
$20 million in annual revenue, whereas in 2014, the median
annual revenue was just shy of $100 million, which had come
down from a peak of nearly $200 million during the financial
crisis.  While this trend has resulted in more stable IPOs and
reduced risk for capital market investors, with less risk, there’s
often less reward.
As Ben Evans wrote in his report, “Almost all the returns
are now private. Old world tech giants returned plenty in
public markets—new ones have not.” By old world tech
giants, he’s referring to companies such as Microsoft, Oracle,
and even Amazon, all of which have provided much more
value creation for public markets than private markets.
Meanwhile, with companies like LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook,
and Twitter, the clear majority of returns have gone to private
investors. For example, while Microsoft grew private money
20,000 percent, it grew public money 60,000 percent.
Compare that to Facebook, which grew private money 80,000
percent, and public money under 1,000 percent. As Ben Evans
put in his slides, “For Facebook to match Microsoft’s public
market returns, it would need to be worth $45 trillion,” which
is two and half times the GDP of the United States.
THE OLD METHOD: THE COMPANY’S
PERSPECTIVE

While it may seem like the average investor has been excluded
somewhat over the last decade, they haven’t been the only
ones. Most companies are also locked out of the funding
model described above because securing venture capital is an
extremely competitive process, and the path to the public
market is even more rigorous. For first-time founders who
want to approach venture capitalists for an investment, often
they must know someone-who-knows-someone. Having such
a connection allows for a warm introduction as opposed to
being among the hundreds of cold calls that venture capitalists
inevitably receive. To know someone-who-knows-someone
requires already being in the know, which creates a catch-22.
Turning to the public markets from inception for funding is
also rarely possible, as an IPO is a laborious and expensive
process. An IPO requires management to file an S-1 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), go on a road
show to make investors aware of their offering, pay expensive
investment bankers to properly price the public shares, and so
on.
Due to the laboriousness of going public, only the largest
and most successful companies typically pursue this funding
path. They do so once they have matured and want access to
the even bigger capital pool provided by the public markets.
Furthermore, going public allows them to reward their early,
private investors, who after the IPO can sell their shares in the
more liquid public markets.
Without access to venture capitalists or the public markets,
the preferred method for most startups to raise funding
involves family and friends, credit card debt, and a healthy
dose of faith. The good news is that the Internet boom has

spawned a stream of aspiring entrepreneurs, and regulations
are adapting to allow the innovative investor and innovative
entrepreneur to unite around new ideas.
A NEW METHOD OF FUNDING
STARTUPS
During the financial crisis of 2008, debt markets froze and
stock markets crashed, causing major, and in many cases
catastrophic, losses for the individual investor. To protect
investors from similar experiences in the future, new
regulations were put into place. Many of these targeted banks
and their involvement in the crisis, which ultimately affected
the ability of startups to gain access to the capital markets and
other traditional funding methods, including loans and
borrowing. In part, these regulations are why we have seen an
increase in the amount of time it takes for companies to get to
an IPO.
However, some leaders recognized that the world needed to
spur more innovation and not strangle it.  They began to
question the regulations and used famous Internet company
founders, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell, as
examples of how American innovation has made the country
great. These leaders understood that if starting a company and
securing funding was made more difficult, America would
suffer.
Simultaneously, a funding shift was occurring, as many
entrepreneurs realized they didn’t have to rely on venture
capital, family, debt, or the capital markets to raise seed
money: the Internet had become a major force in connecting
7

entrepreneurs to investors through the process of
crowdfunding. It allowed individuals and businesses with an
idea and plan to seek out other individuals who were willing to
invest. What grew out of the inability of entrepreneurs of small
or obscure projects to gain access to the more traditional
methods of raising capital was a new method for connecting
them to all levels of investors.
Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and
others positioned themselves online as a way for connecting
entrepreneurs and investors. In exchange for investors
pledging money, the project or company promised to return
the fruits of its labor, depending on the amount a specific
investor pledged. Recognizing that this platform was a fertile
ground for scams, the sites implemented policies and
procedures to protect investors. For instance, Kickstarter
maintains investor funds in escrow until a project is funded to
a sufficiently high level. If not enough people invest, then
funding stops and investors get their money back.
Many projects have been funded by investors who simply
wanted to see it become a reality, while others funded projects
to receive the product. To get a feel for what Kickstarter can
provide to investors interested in the bitcoin and blockchain
space, simply type those terms into the search box on the
Kickstarter site.  Opportunities for investing in documentaries,
books, games, and application development can be found.
Fund a documentary on Bitcoin, for example, and on
completion investors receive a DVD of that documentary.
One of the most compelling aspects of crowdfunding was
that it not only allowed dreamers to build their product or
business, it allowed investors of all levels to participate in
8

seeing these dreams come true. Prior to crowdfunding, in those
cases where investors wanted to share in the equity
opportunities provided by a startup, they still had to be an
accredited investor. While the intention of requiring investors
at this stage to be accredited is good, it has the side effect of
locking the average investor out of some of the earliest stage
investments with the highest returns.
In 2012, the phenomenon of crowdfunding came to the
forefront of government regulator attention. Fortunately, rather
than killing the concept, the government decided to create
policies around it and market it to assist startups. The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act was signed into
law on April 5, 2012.  It was an acknowledgment of the
potential of crowdfunding to provide alternative financing
methods for startups. Additionally, the act sought to provide
equity-based opportunities to a wide range of investors,
including nonaccredited ones.
CROWDFUNDING PORTALS FOR ALL INVESTORS
The ability of the JOBS Act to open the door to venture
capital for nonaccredited investors, including
crowdfunding and ICO investments, has been a great step
forward in increasing the number of people who may be
included in these opportunities. One of the provisions of
the JOBS Act will be the implementation of portals—
online platforms on which investors can find investment
opportunities. These portals must be approved by both the
SEC and FINRA.  Although there aren’t currently many
such portals (Wefunder is one), over time, the number will
increase and provide even more opportunities for investors
9
10
11

and entrepreneurs.  Additionally, we expect that portals
will soon be set up by broker-dealers to provide a
combination of investment opportunities with advice and
access.
The JOBS Act gave nonaccredited investors their first
opportunity in 80 years  to invest privately in startups and
receive equity compensation. Although the act was signed into
law in 2012, Title III of the act, which allows for
nonaccredited investors, was only put in place in May 2016.
Much of this delay had to do with the need for the SEC to be
involved and adopt “final rules to permit companies to offer
and sell securities through crowdfunding.”  Some of the
policies put in place with Title III included restrictions on the
length of fundraising efforts, the amount that an investor could
invest, and that investments must take place within an SEC-
regulated intermediary, either through a broker-dealer or a
funding portal.
It’s expected that even with these restrictions, investors will
have more opportunities to gain equity-based compensation
for investments in new businesses, including cryptoasset-based
investments. The barn door of alternative financing methods
for startups is wide open, and those involved with cryptoasset-
based projects have already begun using their technologies to
find ways to raise capital.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
CRYPTOASSET AND A STARTUP
Before we dive into the specifics of how a cryptoasset offering
12
13
14
15
16

is carried out, the innovative investor needs to understand that
the model of crowdfunding cryptoassets is doubly disruptive.
By leveraging crowdfunding, cryptoasset offerings are
creating room for the average investor to stand alongside
venture capitalists, and the crowdfunding structure is
potentially obviating the need for venture capitalists and the
capital markets entirely. The second aspect is what makes the
integration of crowdfunding with cryptoassets doubly
disruptive, and puts cryptoasset offerings in another league
entirely separate from Kickstarter. Joel Monegro, cofounder of
Placeholder Ventures and former blockchain lead at Union
Square Ventures (USV), was the first to encapsulate this idea
cleanly in a blog titled, “Fat Protocols.”
Monegro’s thesis is as follows: The Web is supported by
protocols like the transmission control protocol/Internet
protocol (TCP/IP), the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and
simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), all of which have
become standards for routing information around the Internet.
However, these protocols are commoditized, in that while they
form the backbone of our Internet, they are poorly monetized.
Instead, what is monetized is the applications on top of the
protocols. These applications have turned into mega-
corporations, such as Facebook and Amazon, which rely on
the base protocols of the Web and yet capture the vast majority
of the value. The construction of the Web as we currently
know it is shown in Figure 16.1 from USV with “Value
Captured” on the y-axis.

Figure 16.1  Thin protocols and fat applications: how value is captured within the
Web
Source: www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols
Contrast this model with that of cryptoassets, where the
protocol layer must be directly monetized for the applications
on it to work. Bitcoin is a good example. The protocol is
Bitcoin itself, which is monetized via the native asset of
bitcoin. All the applications like Coinbase, OpenBazaar, and
Purse.io rely on Bitcoin, which drives up the value of bitcoin.
In other words, within a blockchain ecosystem, for the
applications to have any value, the protocol needs to store
value, so the more that applications derive value from the
protocol, the more the value of the protocol layer grows.
Given many applications will be built on these protocols, a
protocol should grow to be larger in monetary value than any
single application atop it, which is the inverse of the value
creation of the Internet. See Figure 16.2 for a depiction of how
value is captured within blockchain architectures.

Figure 16.2 
 Fat protocols and thin applications: how value is captured within
blockchains
Source: www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols
Interestingly, once these blockchain protocols are released,
they take on lives of their own. While some are supported by
foundations, like the Ethereum Foundation or Zcash
Foundation, the protocols themselves are not companies. They
don’t have income statements, cash flows, or shareholders
they report to. The creation of these foundations is intended to
help the protocol by providing some level of structure and
organization, but the protocol’s value does not depend on the
foundation. Furthermore, as open-source software projects,
anyone with the proper merits can join the protocol
development team. These protocols have no need for the
capital markets because they create self-reinforcing economic
ecosystems. The more people use the protocol, the more
valuable the native assets within it become, drawing more
people to use the protocol, creating a self-reinforcing positive
feedback loop. Often, core protocol developers will also work
for a company that provides application(s) that use the
proto255col, and that is a way for the protocol developers to

get paid over the long term. They can also benefit from
holding the native asset since inception.
LAUNCHING A NEW CRYPTOASSET
WITH AN ICO
Initial coin offering (ICO) is the term most commonly used to
describe crowdfunding the launch of a new cryptoasset. We’d
like to expand this term to refer to initial cryptoasset offering,
as the specific use of the term “coin” implies that these are
currencies, which as we covered in Chapter 4, is most
certainly not the case for all cryptoassets. Our definition is
more expansive, as many new ICOs relate to the creation of
new cryptotokens and cryptocommodities.
To get an idea of the growth of ICOs over the last few
years, see Figure 16.3. In this chart, note two of the major
ICOs that occurred during this period: the successful Ethereum
launch in 2014 and the infamous launch of The DAO in 2016.
For a few months after the DAOsaster there was a significant
drop-off in ICOs, but by the end of 2016, cumulative ICO
funding was $236 million for the year, which was nearly 50
percent of the $496 million raised through traditional venture
capital for blockchain projects in 2016.  Given the rate of
growth in ICOs, 2017 may be the year where more money is
raised through ICOs than through traditional venture capital.

and the amount they raised, while the dark gray bars show the cumulative amount
raised via ICOs in a year.)

Announcing the ICO
The new cryptoasset can be announced any number of ways: a
conference, on Twitter, Reddit, Medium, or Bitcointalk. It is
important that the announcement is followed by a white paper
containing details about the founders and advisory board, and
that it clearly outlines the structure of the initial crowdsale. It
should be easy to contact the founding team, whether through
one of the aforementioned social media channels or a
dedicated Slack or Telegram channel. If an ICO is scant on
information, that is an immediate red flag.
The innovative investor should use the relevant aspects of
the framework we detailed in Chapter 12 to investigate

whether an ICO is a sound investment. That said, things are a
little trickier with ICOs than with currently functioning
cryptoassets. Since ICOs use the crowdfunding model to raise
money to build a network, there often is no existing network
up and running, thus no blockchain, hash rate, user base, or
companies built on it. Everything is an idea at this stage. As a
result, the integrity and prior history of the founding and
advisory team are all the more important, as is the thematic
investigation of whether this ICO is filling a marketplace and
business need.
Structuring and Timing of the ICO
ICOs have a fixed start and end date, and often there is a
bonus structure involved with investing earlier. For instance,
investing at an early stage may get an investor 10 to 20 percent
more of a cryptoasset. The bonus structure is meant to
incentivize people to buy in early, which helps to assure that
the ICO will hit its target offering. There’s nothing like
bonuses followed by scarcity to drive people to buy.
It’s best practice that an ICO also have a minimum and
maximum amount that it plans to raise. The minimum is to
ensure the development team will have enough to make a
viable product, and the maximum is to keep the speculation of
crowds in check. For example, the infamous DAO ICO didn’t
set a maximum limit on the fundraising amount, which led to
rampant speculation.
The offering should lay out how the new asset will be
distributed, and how the funds that are raised will be used.
Often the founding team will keep some of the assets for
themselves, which is similar to when a founding team of a

startup keeps a percentage of the company. What’s important
is that these terms are fair and accompanied by reasonable
explanations.
Crowdsale Begins
Typically, the innovative investor will submit funds for an
ICO by sending either bitcoin or ether to a special address the
developer team provides. Just as one could send bitcoin or
ether to an address to pay for an online purchase, innovative
investors can send bitcoin or ether to an address to reserve
their share of an ICO.
Depending on the intent of the ICO, investors may receive
a cryptocurrency, cryptocommodity, or cryptotoken in return
for their initial investment. How an investor receives the
appropriate cryptoasset can differ, as some may require the
creation of a wallet to store the asset prior to making them
available for sale on an exchange (creating this wallet might
be a more technical effort and could require following detailed
instructions from the ICO provider); others will simply
provide access to the asset that can be moved to an exchange
(this can have an impact on the value of an asset if there’s a
large amount of early sales on exchanges soon after the
closing of an ICO). Typically, information on the ICO will
outline how the asset delivery process will work, and this
should be read prior to making an investment so that there are
no surprises for the investor.
Keeping Track of the ICOs
Numerous online sites list new ICOs and other resources to
keep tabs on current and future ones.  Smith + Crown is a
18

well-respected firm that’s positioning itself as an information
source for the ICO world. It provides an updated list of
current, past, and upcoming ICO sales.  Other resources
include ICO Countdown  and Cyber-Fund.  CoinFund also
operates a great Slack community, with dozens of threads,
many of which are dedicated to conversations about the
specifics of upcoming ICOs.
Criticism of the ICO Model
Daniel Krawisz of the Satoshi Institute  considers ICOs
“snake oil” and “pump and dump scams.”  Pavel
Kravchenko, founder of Distributed Lab, questions if we
“really need all of these coins” and advises, “Let’s think for a
moment before participating in an ICO — could the same
technology solve the same problems without the coin?”
While some ICOs can be from misleading asset issuers or
seem “Ponzi-like,” innovative investors have the resources
provided in Chapter 11 to help them avoid such schemes.
Others will scream that an ICO is a scam simply because they
disagree with the funding model, as can be common with some
Bitcoin Maximalists.
The ICO debate will continue, and it’s prudent for the
innovative investor to stay abreast of contemporary thinking
around the benefits and drawbacks of ICOs.
The Howey Test for Discerning If an ICO Is a Security
The Howey Test is the result of the 1946 U.S. Supreme Court
case, SEC v Howey Co, which investigated whether a
convoluted scheme to sell and then lease tracts of land
qualified as an “investment contract,” also known as a
19
20
21
22
23
24

security. The Howey Test determines whether something
should be classified as a security, even if it is referred to
differently in an offering to avoid regulatory action. If
something classifies as a security, SEC oversight requires a
long list of requirements to be met, which would likely
dampen all but the most well-capitalized innovations in the
exciting new world of cryptoasset offerings.
If an asset meets the following criteria, it will likely be
considered a security:
1.   It is an investment of money.
2.   The investment of money is in a common enterprise.
3.   There is an expectation of profits from the
investment.
For the most part, the teams behind ICOs want to avoid
classification as a security because it will demand hefty legal
fees, delay innovation, and require restructuring of the current
cryptoasset landscape. While most ICOs meet the first two
conditions, the third condition is up for interpretation. Do
investors buy into an ICO as an “expectation of profit,” or do
they buy into an ICO to gain access to the ultimate utility that
will be provided by the blockchain architecture? While the
distinction may seem small, it can make all the difference.
A joint effort by Coinbase, Coin Center, ConsenSys, and
Union Square Ventures, with the legal assistance of Debevoise
& Plimpton LLP, produced a document called, “A Securities
Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens.”  It is especially
important for the team behind an ICO to utilize this document
in conjunction with a lawyer to determine if a cryptoasset sale
falls under SEC jurisdiction. The SEC made it clear in July
25
26

2017 that some cryptoassets can be considered securities.
The document includes a framework for scoring the ICO
and identifying its applicability as a security, and thus its
consideration in light of the regulations that go along with that
classification. Innovative investors may also want to evaluate
these criteria on their own in line with what they know about
the ICO: if there’s a belief by the investor that the offering
should be considered an investment contract and the offering
team is moving forward without that assumption, that could be
a red flag about the legitimacy of an ICO. The SEC made it
clear in July 2017 that some cryptoassets can be considered
securities.
The framework document is also helpful because it includes
best practices for an ICO, which provides a good checklist for
innovative investors. They are paraphrased below to provide
context for what an investor should consider for any potential
ICO investment (much of this overlaps with what has been
stated already, but with ICOs, it’s best to be doubly sure.)
Note that in this context, cryptoasset is synonymous with
token:
1.   Is there a published white paper?
2.   Is there a detailed development road map that
includes a breakdown of all appropriate financials
along the way?
3.   Does it use an open, public blockchain, and is the
code published?
4.   Is there clear, logical, and fair pricing in the token
sale?
5.   Is it clear how much of the token has been assigned
27
28

for the development team and how those tokens will
be released? Releasing them over time keeps the
developers engaged and protects against centralized
control of the token.
6.   Does the token sale tout itself as an investment? It
should instead be promoted for its functionality and
use case and include appropriate disclaimers that
identify it as a product, not an investment.
ANGEL AND EARLY STAGE INVESTORS
One of the most exciting and potentially lucrative
opportunities for an accredited investor is to be an angel
investor with a startup. Angel investors can range from the
family member who provides capital (or a credit card) to more
formalized angel investors, who are either aligned with a
venture capital firm or on their own seeking investment
opportunities.
Angel investments can vary in size from the low thousands
to much higher via early stage investment opportunities. If a
venture moves on to more formalized funding after the angel
stage, those who invested as angels may see the value of their
investment increase, on paper at least. As a company grows
and ultimately arrives at its exit strategy of an IPO or takeover,
angel investors can achieve sizable gains from their initial
investment.
The online site BnktotheFuture.com provides angel
investing opportunities in cryptoassets and related companies
to accredited investors. The site has provided opportunities to
be angel and early stage investors in big names, such as

Factom, BitPay, BitPesa, ShapeShift, Kraken, and even
BnktotheFuture itself. It also provides access to mining pools
for bitcoin and ether, in which investors can gain a daily
dividend from the cryptoassets mined through those pools.
Angel investors may also join online communities such as
AngelList  and Crunchbase  where accredited investors can
connect with startups. Both have robust listings for blockchain
related companies. In fact, AngelList has over 500 blockchain
companies listed with an average $4 million valuation and a
growing list of over 700 blockchain investors.  These sites
are great ways to find information on existing startups and
venture capitalists, and they can provide the accredited
innovative investor with good information and background on
the process of being an angel investor and the opportunities
therein.
One of the oldest groups of angel investors in the
blockchain and bitcoin space is called BitAngels.  Michael
Terpin of BitAngels has been active in angel investing in
blockchain companies for as long as the opportunities have
existed. Terpin’s annual conference, CoinAgenda, is one of the
best opportunities for investors to see and hear management
from blockchain startups present their ideas and business
models. Each year, Terpin brings together the top startups in
the space to present to varying levels of investors. In 2016, the
company that won the conference’s award for best of show
was Airbitz, which provides a single sign-on platform for
blockchain apps. Soon after the conference, Airbitz raised over
$700,000 on Bnktothefuture.com.

cryptoassets and the companies involved will continue to
grow. We believe that these opportunities will not only impact
the way people view their investing philosophy, but will also
affect how they work with financial professionals who are
involved in their investments, such as their financial advisors
or accountants. The innovative investor can’t lose sight of his
or her financial goals and objectives. Chasing after what seem
to be high-profit opportunities must be tempered by an
understanding of the accompanying risk. Of all the chapters in
our book, this chapter has covered material that is moving the
most quickly. Therefore the innovative investor that wants to
play in the world of ICOs will need to do ample due diligence
beyond what he or she has read here, including staying abreast
of statements from regulators on the classification of these
assets.
We’ve shown the various, and still growing, ways investors
can gain access to cryptoassets. Now that the innovative
investor has come this far down the cryptoasset rabbit hole,
it’s time to revisit his or her current approach and investment
portfolio in light of what has been learned.

Chapter 17
Preparing Current Portfolios
for Blockchain Disruption
hen Toffler stated in the 1970s that exponential change would
cause millions of people to have an “abrupt collision with the
future,” it was issued as a warning. When considering
investing in cryptoassets, innovative investors need to not only
consider an individual investment (like bitcoin or ether) but
also how this new asset class and the overall concept of
blockchain technology could impact other assets within their
portfolio. This chapter focuses on the importance of actively
evaluating and potentially protecting one’s portfolio in the
face of exponential change.
When pondering the changes cryptoassets are bringing to
the way we invest today, we must also recognize that the
entire concept of blockchain technology heralds significant
disruption to companies and industries. For most investors,
these disruptions will affect investments that have already
been made or are under consideration.
For instance, if Bitcoin influences how remittances are
handled, what impact may that have on stocks like Western

Union, a remittances kingpin? If Ethereum takes off as a
decentralized world computer, will that have any effect on
companies with cloud computing offerings, such as Amazon,
Microsoft, and Google? If companies can get paid more
quickly and with lower transaction fees using the latest
cryptocurrency, will that have an impact on credit card
providers like Visa and American Express?
EXPONENTIAL DISRUPTION
Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School,
wrote the seminal text on how large companies, often referred
to as incumbents, struggle with maneuvering around
exponential change. In The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New
Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, Christensen makes
no qualms about how even the most well managed of firms
can fail when confronted with a technology that threatens to
disrupt their market. Broadly disruptive technologies lay the
foundation for new growth, with the most influential
blossoming into what are called general purpose technologies,
which include electricity, the automobile, the Internet, and yes,
blockchain technology. While such growth provides many
opportunities, even if large companies recognize the potential
of a technology, they are often handcuffed when they try to
capitalize on it. The problem they face is threefold:
First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally promise
lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive technologies typically
are first commercialized in emerging or insignificant markets. And third,
leading firms’ most profitable customers generally don’t want, and indeed
initially can’t use, products based on disruptive technologies.
Pursuing a product line in the new market is not additive to the
1

incumbent’s existing business because, as Christensen
explains, disruptive products have lower margins, smaller
markets, and target a customer base with whom the company
is not familiar. Sometimes the new product line can even be
subtractive from the company’s existing business line—known
as cannibalization—because it is superior to other products it
already offers, and so customers start buying the new product
as opposed to the more lucrative (for the company) older
product. However, avoiding the new technology because of a
fear of cannibalization can be the kiss of death. As Christensen
points out,
The fear of cannibalizing sales of existing products is often cited as a reason
why established firms delay the introduction of new technologies… . But in
disruptive situations, action must be taken before careful plans are made.
Because much less can be known about what markets need or how large
they can become, plans must serve a very different purpose: They must be
plans for learning rather than plans for implementation.
Hence, the incumbent that avoids developing products that
utilize the new technology may be maximizing short-term
revenue, but is shooting itself in the foot over the long term.
As Christensen notes, in the early stages of a disruptive
technology, it is most important that the company learn and
experiment. If the company doesn’t experiment early on, then
by the time the technology is inflecting in its growth—with a
market that is sizeable enough to move the needle for the
incumbent—it is too late. By that point, the smaller companies
that took the time to master the new technology are much
more nimble and experienced and will outcompete incumbents
in what have become big growth markets.
If an incumbent misses enough of these growth
opportunities, its offerings will become obsolete, its revenue

will dwindle, its market capitalization will shrink, and it will
become a dead-end investment. Often these are referred to as
value-traps. As the innovative investor might expect, the fall
of incumbents is happening at an accelerating rate, as is the
rise of new winners. The disruption of incumbents can be
quantified by how long the biggest companies stay in the S&P
500, or their average life span. The average life span for
companies in the S&P 500 has fallen from 60 years in the
1960s to below 20 years of late.  This is clearly a sign that
investors must not be complacent. One cannot assume that the
companies succeeding today will continue to be the leading
(and profitable) companies for decades to come.
Disruptive technologies are also being invented at an
accelerating rate. The trend is one we have been witnessing for
millennia. For example, between AD 900 and 1900, a new
general purpose technology was invented roughly every 100
years, with notable examples including the steam engine,
automobile, and electricity. In the twentieth century, a new
general purpose technology came into existence every 15
years, with familiar examples like computers, the Internet, and
biotechnology. In the twenty-first century, general purpose
technologies have come into existence every 4 years, with
autonomous robotics and blockchain technology as two of the
more recent examples.
While disruptive technologies tend to unseat incumbents,
there are examples of companies that have managed to
reinvent themselves continually for decades. Just as there is
danger, there is also opportunity for incumbents to capitalize
on exciting new growth markets, which can boost their
revenue and market capitalizations. Discerning the difference
2
3

between a value-trap and a reborn incumbent can make all the
difference for the innovative investor.
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN THE
FINANCIAL SECTOR
In 2016, the father-son team of Don and Alex Tapscott
published the book Blockchain Revolution: How the
Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and
the World, and William Mougayar published the book, The
Business Blockchain: Promise, Practice, and Application of
the Next Internet Technology. As the titles imply, these books
discuss the many ways in which blockchain technology is
currently and will continue to disrupt how business is done
worldwide. In this chapter, we investigate a few ways the
financial sector may be upended by cryptoassets and how
incumbents are responding. Using the financial sector as a
leaping off point, investors can then apply their learnings to
other industries.
The financial industry must slog through a swamp of
regulation, sometimes making it slow to adapt to new
technologies. Recently the industry has been showing its age
with numerous data breaches, near-monopolistic structures,
and continued use of tools and models developed decades ago
that still run the inefficient money systems in place today.
However, the Tapscotts believe the days of “Franken-
finance”—that convoluted, contradictory, and often irrational
system of finance we’ve lived under for so many years—are
“numbered as blockchain technology promises to make the
next decade one of great upheaval and dislocation but also

immense opportunity for those who seize it.”
Recall from Chapter 2 that not all instances in which
blockchain technology is used necessarily involve a
cryptoasset (such as bitcoin or ether). In fact, thus far the
majority of companies in the financial services space have
opted for blockchain implementations void of cryptoassets. It
is increasingly common for these implementations to be
referred to as distributed ledger technology (DLT), which
differentiates them from the blockchains of Bitcoin, Ethereum,
and beyond. For companies pursuing a DLT strategy, they still
utilize many of the innovations put forth by the developers of
public blockchains, but they don’t have to associate
themselves with those groups or share their networks. They
pick and choose the parts of the software they want to use and
run it on their own hardware in their own networks, similar to
intranets (earlier referred to as private, permissioned
blockchains).
We see many DLT solutions as band-aids to the coming
disruption. While DLT will help streamline existing processes
—which will help profit margins in the short term—for the
most part these solutions operate within what will become
increasingly outdated business models. As we will cover with
insurance, incumbents could use public blockchain
architectures to provision similar services to what they do
already, but it would cannibalize some of their revenue. Such
cannibalization is admittedly painful, but as Christensen lays
out, it is often necessary for long-term survival. Additionally,
regulation can handcuff the incumbents, and in the financial
services industry incumbents are particularly sensitive to
regulatory rebukes after the financial crisis of 2008.
4

The incumbents protect themselves by dismissing
cryptoassets, a popular example being JPMorgan’s Jamie
Dimon, who famously claimed bitcoin was “going to be
stopped.”  Mr. Dimon and other financial incumbents who
dismiss cryptoassets are playing exactly to the precarious mold
that Christensen outlines:
Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition
than had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies
underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have
other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value.
Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler,
smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use.
Disruptive technologies like cryptoassets initially gain traction
because they’re “cheaper, simpler, smaller.” This early
traction occurs on the fringe, not in the mainstream, which
allows incumbents like Mr. Dimon to dismiss them. But
cheaper, simpler, smaller things rarely stay on the fringe, and
the shift to mainstream can be swift, catching the incumbents
off guard.
Remittances and Blockchain Technology
One area long discussed as ripe for disruption is the personal
remittances market, where individuals who work outside of
their home countries send money back home to provide for
their families. The market is massive, with the World Bank
reporting worldwide remittance flows north of $600 billion,
though it admits that the estimate is conservative: “The true
size of remittances, including unrecorded flows through
formal and informal channels, is believed to be significantly
larger.”
Most remittances originate in high-income countries and
5
6

are sent to individuals in developing countries, where the
banking systems may not be easily accessible. As families in
the receiving countries are typically unbanked—without
access to a bank account or direct wire transfer capabilities—
companies that provide a solution serve as a lifeline between
the remitter and his or her family.  For many years companies
such as Western Union and MoneyGram have used their
lifeline position to levy high fees on these remitters, as they
are among few options available and provide a mission critical
service.
For example, toward the end of 2016 the global average fee
for a remittance was just shy of 7.5 percent, with the weighted
average coming in just under 6 percent.  These fees are
decreasing, and rightfully so; in 2008, the average fee was
nearly 10 percent, which meant that someone with $100 to
send home only ending up giving $90 to his or her family,
while the remitting company took the other $10.  It hardly
seems fair; some call it exploitation.
As more competitors enter the market in the Internet era,
people realize there is little reason for such high fees to be
charged. While the term “wire money” may make it sound like
the company providing the service is doing something
sophisticated, in reality there’s no wire. This is an outdated
term from the days when Western Union was a telegraph
company, literally using wires to send messages. Those wires
are long gone. For the most part, all that happens in a
remittance is a few centralized entities rebalance their books,
debiting one account and crediting the other, after taking out a
large chunk of the original amount, of course.
It’s no stretch then to recognize that bitcoin, with its low
7
8
9

cost, high speed, and a network that operates 24/7, could be
the preferred currency for these types of international
transactions. Of course, there are requirements to make this
happen. The recipient needs to have a bitcoin wallet, or a
business needs to serve as an intermediary, to ultimately get
the funds to the recipient. While the latter option creates a
new-age middleman—which potentially has its own set of
problems—thus far these middlemen have proved to be much
less costly than Western Union. The middleman can be a
pawnshop owner with a cell phone, who receives the bitcoin
and pays out local currency to the intended recipient.
In India, the largest receiver of remittances in the world
with 12 percent of the global remittance total, a recent
partnership between bitcoin exchanges is projected to bring
the fee down to 0.5 percent for remittances into the country.
In Mexico, there’s been a huge surge in volume at the
country’s bitcoin exchange, Bitso, where funds can be
transferred for a similarly low fee.  All of these companies
are eyeing the tens of billions of dollars the incumbents make
from levying fat fees on vulnerable customers.
The impact of this major disruption in the remittance
market should be recognized by the innovative investor not
only because of the threat it creates to a publicly traded
company like Western Union (WU) but for the opportunities it
provides as well. For example, Bitso secured startup funding
through the online investment service bnktothefuture.com,
which, as we discussed in Chapter 16, connects investors with
cryptoasset startups.
Business-to-Business Payments and Blockchain Technology
10
11
12

Sending money internationally goes beyond citizens, as
businesses also transmit large volumes to global business
partners. While this industry is too large to dive into every
detail, the same story laid out in remittances applies: fees are
generally higher than they should be, and payments are slower
than they should be. Visa, for example, has sensed the
opportunity and is working with a startup called Chain to build
a business-to-business payment solution using blockchain
technology.  BitPesa is another company that leverages
Bitcoin to help companies in Africa (currently Kenya, Nigeria,
Tanzania, and Uganda) send and receive global payments.
Ripple has been a popular startup for incumbents to work
with, and some of them are creating projects that utilize its
native asset, XRP. Incumbents such as Bank of America,
RBC, Santander, BMO, CIBC, ATB Financial, and more use
Ripple’s blockchain-based technology to achieve faster and
more secure financial transactions.  If realized, these efforts
could not only reward the companies that utilize Ripple but
also potentially benefit Ripple’s own cryptoasset, XRP, which
can be used as a bridge currency to help settlements on the
Ripple network.
The innovative investor will want to monitor how cheaper
money flows may create opportunities for new and existing
businesses in emerging markets. Capital fuels the growth of
industries, and if money moves more freely between citizens
and businesses, that may induce a significant economic boom
in developing markets. This, too, may warrant an investigation
of which geographies stand to benefit the most, as many ETFs
and mutual funds can be purchased for exposure to targeted
geographies. Geographic diversification can benefit a portfolio
13

16

when isolated macroeconomic dislocations strike.
Insurance and Blockchain Technology
Thus far, most insurance companies have opted to investigate
DLT implementations and have not ventured far into the world
of cryptoassets. Large consulting firms are competing to be
viewed as thought leaders on how distributed ledger
technology will change the insurance industry, as these firms
hope to win valuable contracts with deep-pocketed insurance
companies that need help navigating the potential disruption.
Deloitte believes that “a blockchain could allow the industry
as a whole to streamline its processing and offer a better user
experience for customers who have to make a claim.
Simultaneously, storing claims and customer information on a
blockchain would cut down fraudulent activity.”
Innovative investors can get a leg up on which insurance
companies may be good short-term investment candidates and
which to avoid, based on the action they take given the
predictions of well-respected consulting firms. That said, as
we have already mentioned, we view many of these DLT
implementations as band-aids to prolong the life of systems
that will fade into obsolescence over the coming decades. For
the long term investor, careful analysis should be undertaken
to understand if insurance companies are pursuing DLT use
cases that will provide a lasting and meaningful solution.
Lastly, some of the major consulting firms may be so
entrenched in incumbent ideology that they too may be blind
to the coming disruption.
Recall from Chapter 5 that there are already companies like
Etherisc providing decentralized insurance policies. The
17

disruption can go beyond the capital raising and claims
management processes of insurance companies, and into the
risk models themselves. For example, Augur’s prediction
platform built on Ethereum allows for markets to be created
around the outcome of real-world events.  The predictive
applications for this platform in the insurance area are varied
and could have a direct impact on the actuarial industry, which
is an integral part of the insurance industry and currently
defines its pricing models.
Options exist for insurance companies to find a happy
medium using the solutions provided by cryptoassets. For
example, Factom has implemented a smart contract platform
that allows for the creation of insurance policies with
improved security and identification capabilities. Peter Kirby,
the cofounder of Factom, points out that his platform can
protect policyholders from fraud and identity theft, or at least
provide them with the ability to track down the perpetrators of
fraud and identity theft through the immutability provided by
the blockchain technology that his platform is built on.
Cutting down on fraud and identity theft would help the
bottom line of many insurance companies tremendously.
Furthermore, operating in the transparency of public networks
would do much to bolster trust in their operations, which could
draw more customers.
DON’T REARRANGE THE DECK CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC
In the days immediately after the 2016 election of Donald
Trump as U.S. president, the stocks of companies in the
financial sector rallied in expectation of the new
president’s potential policy shifts from that of the prior
18
19

administration.  During that time, investors benefited
from having financial stocks in their portfolio, and
perhaps, many more put these stocks into their portfolio
after the election, either on the advice of advisors or as a
reaction to the financial media claiming financial stocks
were bound to benefit in the “age of Trump.” However,
focusing on these short-term trends is like rearranging the
deck chairs on a sinking Titanic.
The innovative investor should ask if these gains were
due to actual policies or the expectation of these policies,
which hadn’t yet been implemented. Policies can be
temporarily effective at reinforcing the financial status quo
but are only stopgaps in the face of long-term secular
trends. It’s important to recognize the disruption that
bitcoin and cryptoassets can bring to the entire global
financial system. Armed with this recognition, the
innovative investor should consider the long-term
investment prospects of financial companies clinging to
their current operating models without consideration or
recognition of the impending disruptions that these
technologies will bring to the sector. The bottom line is
that rather than fretting over where to position their deck
chair, investors should consider if they should be long-
term buyers of these existing banks and financial firms,
given what they know about blockchain technology and
the potential it brings to significantly change the banking
industry.
THREE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR
20

SURVIVAL
We list three general strategies incumbents will likely use in
their attempt to capitalize on the potential of blockchain
technology.
If You Can’t Beat ’Em, Buy ’Em
Toward the end of 2015 and through much of 2016, it seemed
as if every single financial services firm was waking up to the
potential of blockchain technology to disrupt its industry.
When incumbents feel like they are late and being
outmaneuvered by startups, they simply buy or invest in the
startups. That is precisely what happened. The list of
incumbents investing in bitcoin and blockchain startups
accelerated to a frenzied pace starting in late 2015, and
continued through the first half of 2016, including Citi, Visa,
MasterCard, New York Life, Wells Fargo, Nasdaq,
Transamerica, ABN AMRO, and Western Union.
While the investing or takeover strategy has been a go-to
for incumbents trying to avoid disruption, it is rarely as
effective as hoped. Once the big company swallows the
startup, or begins meddling, it is often hard for the startup to
retain its fast-moving and flexible culture. Nimble cultures are
key to succeeding in the early stages of a disruptive
technology, and if the startup is tainted by corporate
bureaucracy, then it will quickly lose its edge.
Circle the Wagons
Industry consortiums have been extremely popular among
incumbents investigating how to apply distributed ledger
21

technology to their industry. On one hand, a consortium makes
perfect sense, as a distributed ledger needs to be shared among
many parties for it to have any use. A collaborative consortium
helps financial services companies—many of which have
historically been competitors that keep their business
processes close to their chest—learn how to share. On the
other hand, these consortiums can hit snags if too many big
names and big egos become involved.
One of the most famous consortiums is R3, which launched
on September 15, 2015, with big names such as JPMorgan,
Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit
Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street,
and UBS. By the end of September, 13 more financial
companies had joined, including Bank of America, BNY
Mellon, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Toronto-
Dominion Bank. Before 2015 was over, 20 other financial
companies joined R3. R3 consists of the leading financial
companies in the world, many of which are held either in
individual equity or bond positions in portfolios or are in
managed money investments like mutual funds and ETFs.
Another consortium, The Hyperledger Project,  offers
more open membership than R3. Remember, one of the
strengths and defining aspects of an effective blockchain
project is its open source ethos. The Hyperledger project was
launched in December 2015 under the umbrella of the Linux
Foundation to create a collaborative and open-source platform
that could work with many industries, not just financial
companies.  Companies currently supporting the project
include Airbus, American Express, Daimler, IBM, and SAP.
The project states, “Hyperledger members and staff are
22
23

committed to sharing best-practices and providing assistance
with the use-case development, Proof-of-Concept (POC)
testing, and adoption of Hyperledger.”  Initial efforts
undertaken by the group are in the finance and healthcare
industries, with plans to build supply chain solutions as well. It
will be interesting to see how this cross-industry collaborative
and open source effort proceeds and what results come of it.
An innovative investor will do well to follow the group’s
efforts to help identify specific companies that may benefit
from the results.
One of the more interesting recent consortiums was the
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. It went public in late February
2017, and its founding members include Accenture, BNY
Mellon, CME Group, JPMorgan, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters,
and UBS.  What is most interesting about this alliance is that
it aims to marry private industry and Ethereum’s public
blockchain. While the consortium will work on software
outside of Ethereum’s public blockchain, the intent is for all
software to remain interoperable in case companies want to
utilize Ethereum’s open network in the future.
Create an Innovation Lab and Leave It Alone
The third strategy that an incumbent can follow is known as an
innovation lab. Several universities, including Harvard, have
set up innovation labs as a way to foster innovation through a
collaborative effort between students and businesses. The
corporate world has also jumped on this unique way of
providing a forum for nurturing creative ideas with solid
business skills. Often, these innovation labs are left alone, or
largely untouched, by the incumbent parent, perhaps following
24
25

Christensen’s advice,
With few exceptions, the only instances in which mainstream firms have
successfully established a timely position in a disruptive technology were
those in which the firms’ managers set up an autonomous organization
charged with building a new and independent business around the disruptive
technology.
In the twenty-first century, the innovation lab concept has
been embraced most famously by Google, which encourages
creativity and innovation beyond an employee’s current
position. The company has created the Google Garage  as a
(somewhat) formal structure in which employees can pursue
innovations with others in the company. This has resulted in
projects, such as its autonomous vehicles effort, that Google
has grown organically in the hopes of providing additional
future revenue.
A key feature that needs to be reinforced from
Christensen’s quote is the need to “set up an autonomous
organization.” Just setting up an innovation lab within a
company is not a guarantee of success. These labs must be
allowed to function as autonomous organizations, without the
tunnel vision of existing business and profit models.
THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY STILL
AWAITS
We believe the greatest opportunities for investment growth
are in public blockchains and their associated assets. It is the
companies that stretch themselves to work with cryptoassets
that will benefit the most over the long term. If instead a
company pursues its own DLT solution, investors must decide
26

if that solution will enhance the value of the company in the
long term.
The opportunities are endless and will be only limited by
the ingenuity of visionaries, developers, and business leaders.
It will be an exciting time for innovation, and potentially, a
rewarding time for those innovative investors who are
equipped to recognize the opportunities that lie ahead.
TAX REPORTING OF CRYPTOASSET
GAINS
Any financial professional or successful investor knows that
managing an investment portfolio requires an understanding
and approach to the tax ramifications (both on the gain and
loss side) when making investment decisions. These types of
strategies should also be part of innovative investors’ approach
to cryptoassets within their portfolio. While some decisions
have been made related to the tax treatment of these assets,
overall there’s a lack of clarity, and even worse, a lack of
understanding by the agencies providing tax guidance. As
cryptoassets gain more publicity and acceptance, rest assured
that government regulators and tax collectors will take more
and more notice.
All cryptoassets have a value, and when bought or sold, can
create a gain or loss for the innovative investor. It should come
as no surprise that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the
United States has made clear its desire to get a cut of this
digital pie. In 2014, the IRS decided it understood bitcoin and
issued guidance on its tax treatment with IRS Notice 2014-21.
Without detailing the fine print of the ruling,  the basic
27

message was that although bitcoin may be called a virtual
currency, for tax purposes the IRS would treat it as property.
For example, stocks, bonds, and real estate are also considered
property. The guidance stated, “General tax principles that
apply to property transactions apply to transactions using
virtual currency.”
Therefore, an investor, or even a casual user of bitcoin,
must treat it for tax purposes the same way they would stocks,
bonds, and real estate. A capital gain in any of these assets
would warrant a taxable event. Accordingly, capital losses
could be utilized as well. The bottom line with bitcoin, either
for transactions or investing, is that the purchase and sale
prices need to be tracked. The difference will be capital gains
or losses, with appropriate tax treatment based on long-or
short-term holds. The regulation also addresses income paid in
bitcoin and even the mining of bitcoin, which are treated as
immediate income at the market value of bitcoin at the time of
possession.
The 2014 IRS guidance is interesting because, although it
rules primarily on bitcoin, it refers to “virtual currency, such
as bitcoin.” Does this mean that the ruling includes all
cryptoassets in the “virtual currency” classification?
Here’s how the guidance defines what it means by virtual
currency:
In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency—i.e.,
the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is
designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted
as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance—but it does not have
legal tender status in any jurisdiction.
Looking at IRS Notice 2014-21, which provides a bit more
information on tax guidance related to bitcoin and virtual
28

currency, we find an attempt at further clarification:
Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as
a substitute for real currency, is referred to as convertible virtual currency.
Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be
digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into,
U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies.
In this case, bitcoin is considered a “convertible” virtual
currency. The ruling also refers the reader (who is by now
rather confused) to a more “comprehensive description of
convertible digital currencies” that was provided by the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) back in
2013.  Although the FinCEN opinion has less to do with
taxation and more to do with addressing the misuse of digital
currencies for illegal activities, it reveals the fact that
numerous regulatory agencies in the United States have been
unable to provide clarity and a unified voice on how to classify
bitcoin and cryptoassets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also
entered the fray when it charged a startup seeking to offer
bitcoin-based options for not registering the product with it.
This defined the asset as a commodity, not property, which
would then be covered by the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA).
The CFTC Director of Enforcement, Aitan Goelman, tried
to clarify his opinion with this statement, “While there is a lot
of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies,
innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from
following the same rules applicable to all participants in the
commodity derivatives markets.”  It is clearly confusing that
the Director of Enforcement of the agency that ruled bitcoin a
commodity also called it a “virtual currency.”

If some cryptoassets are commodities, this could open them
up to different tax treatment than if they were considered
solely as property. Commodities fall under the 60/40 tax
ruling, meaning 60 percent of the gains on a commodity
transaction are treated as long-term capital gains and 40
percent are treated as short-term capital gains. This is different
from taxing stocks where profitably selling an equity after 12
months is classified as a long-term capital gain with a current
tax rate cap of 15 percent. Selling prior to 12 months would be
considered a short-term gain with the tax ramification based
on an investor’s income bracket.
All cryptoassets are not alike. There needs to be further
clarity and understanding of these assets by government
agencies and potentially a new set of regulations (including tax
treatments) that recognize these differences. For now, the IRS
and the CFTC view these assets differently, and this will
surely necessitate further clarifying rulings by the IRS to
provide appropriate direction. Don’t expect this to happen
quickly; it took the IRS over 15 years to provide tax guidance
on derivatives.
For now, the course to take regarding tax treatment of these
assets should rest with the investor and their accountant. The
IRS considers them property, and therefore recording a gain or
a loss in a similar manner to equities or bonds seems the
prudent path to take.
Neither of us is an accountant, and we can’t forecast how
governmental regulators will ultimately reconcile the issues.
Regarding taxes, the first thing investors should do is to
discuss any bitcoin or cryptoasset activities with their
accountant and lean on the accountant for information and
33

advice. Second, and probably most important, is to keep
records of all activities with these assets (this should include
not only buys and sells, but if an asset was used to purchase a
good or service).  It can be as simple as maintaining a paper-
based or Excel spreadsheet that tracks the date and price of an
asset when acquired and the same information when sold or
when purchases are made with that asset. In time, more
detailed reporting tools and resources will be available from
the more reputable exchanges and from startups creating tools
to track, record, and provide resources for blockchain tax
reporting.
Even though the rules regarding taxation of these assets
may change, one thing is clear: as with any other asset, the
IRS is watching.

Chapter 18
The Future of Investing Is
Here
hroughout this book, we’ve tried to provide historical context
on investing and cryptoassets. Hopefully at this point, there’s a
clear recognition that cryptoassets should be evaluated
alongside other traditional and alternative asset classes. Just as
with any other asset class, there are good cryptoasset
investments and there are bad ones. Considering these
investments requires the same level of due diligence and
research as does any other potential investment.
Although investment opportunities in cryptoassets are
growing, currently most access is available through the
purchase and trading in individual cryptoassets on exchanges.
As we outlined in Chapter 15, some capital market
investments currently exist and more will come to market in
the future. What form these investments will take is yet to be
seen. Will they be mutual funds made up of various
cryptoassets? Perhaps an ETF that invests in an index of a
specific slice of cryptoassets, like a focused privacy portfolio
of monero, dash, and zcash? Already opportunities for

investors to gain access to hedge funds that actively manage
different cryptoassets, including the latest ICOs, are arising.
But maybe the hedge fund structure will largely become a relic
of the past, with asset management infrastructure decentralized
through platforms like Melonport. The potential products and
vehicles are endless and provide investors and money
managers with great opportunities for profit.
Will individual money managers become famous for their
expertise and active management of these assets, or will
passive investments consisting of rules-based categories of
cryptoassets become the vehicle of choice?
In the 1980s, Fidelity’s Magellan Fund was where investors
wanted to place their money, and it was all because of one
person: Peter Lynch. During Lynch’s time, the fund grew from
$20 million to $14 billion, and he beat the S&P 500 index 11
out of 13 years. It was a heyday for active managers and for
mutual funds in general, and investors chased money
managers, not stocks. This enthusiasm for specific money
managers wasn’t isolated to equities in the eighties. As
recently as 2015, much was made about bond guru Bill
Gross’s departure from Pimco to Janus, as Pimco found that
21 percent of its total assets left when Gross did.
Twenty-five years after Peter Lynch left Fidelity, many
financial pundits and writers have criticized his techniques,
specifically his “buy what you know” advice. This was a
cornerstone of his philosophy, as he bought stocks based on
products he used as a customer, experiencing the company’s
business model in the flesh. In clarifying his famous comment
in the face of criticism for active management, Lynch stressed
the need for fundamental analysis of any investment. “People
1

buy a stock and they know nothing about it,” Lynch said.
“That’s gambling, and it’s not good.”
For the innovative investor, recognizing that no investment
should be made with little to no knowledge is not only sage
advice but common sense. Here’s another Burniske-Tatar
Rule: Don’t invest in bitcoin, ether, or any other cryptoasset
just because it’s doubled or tripled in the last week. Before
investing, be able to explain the basics of the asset to a friend
and ascertain if it fits well given the risk profile and goals of
your investment portfolio.
The Millennial Age of Investing
We’ve provided a substantial amount of historical context in
this book as it relates to investing in cryptoassets. Many
longtime investors may regard this information as a reminder
of how they’ve formed their own investing approaches and
strategies, often having learned the hard way. For these
investors, taking the step to considering and potentially
investing in cryptoassets may be an evolution in their own
investing strategy as they become innovative investors.
However, a segment of millennials recognizes these
opportunities and are becoming newly minted investors
through their forays into cryptoassets.
Much has been written and hypothesized about millennials,
or those that entered adulthood around the turn of the century.
Millennials have an entirely different approach to banking and
investing than baby boomers who invested through the dot-
com crash and the financial crisis of 2008.
Having come of age through market crises, millennials are
surprisingly conscious of their financial well-being. A recent
2

study conducted through Facebook found millennials are
highly educated, and perhaps due to the student loans required
to gain this status, their financial situation is an important
consideration in their life. In fact, 86 percent of millennials put
money away each month.  Equally interesting, according to a
Goldman Sachs survey, 33 percent of millennials think they
won’t need a bank by 2020.
Seeing these statistics, it’s no wonder that many financial
institutions are seeking ways to engage the millennial banking
and investing client. The problem is that the business models
of many wealth managers are not positioned to cater to
millennials. Over the last two decades, wealth management
firms have encouraged their financial advisors to sign up only
investors with $250,000 in assets and move away from
servicing all levels of investors.  The reasoning has been to
allow advisors to provide better service to a smaller base of
clients, which is also good for profit margins. However, this
means that their client base is aging. Because of these business
policies, they are now less able to acquire and support young
investors who are perhaps most in need of their assistance.
Perhaps, when wealth management firms were shifting
millennials to online investing sites, rather than providing
them access to personal financial advisors, they were doing
this to address the disruptions that millennials were bringing to
their model. From a business perspective, it was a more cost-
effective way to support this demographic. However, this
approach addressed rather than engaged the demographic.
Further research is making it clear that millennials are
concerned enough to talk about their financial futures,
sometimes more so than their baby boomer parents. A study
3
4
5

from Transamerica reports the following:
Three out of four (76 percent) Millennial workers are discussing saving,
investing, and planning for retirement with family and friends. Surprisingly,
Millennials (18 percent) are twice as likely to “frequently” discuss the topic
compared to Baby Boomers (9 percent).
This from a generation that watched their parents significantly
impacted by the Great Recession, either through downsizings
or losses in investment portfolios. Many of them consider the
stock markets akin to gambling casinos. However, they also
recognize the value of saving, investing, and planning for the
future. Wealth management firms that believe online investing
sites will placate millennials until they get older and wealthier
(and reach the minimum for a financial advisor relationship)
are missing the point of disruption. As many of the wealth
management firms have ignored them, millennials may be
turning their backs on these firms as well, and not surprisingly,
they’re looking for investment vehicles and firms they can feel
comfortable with. In fact, a digital native generation likely has
little problem accepting the value of a digital native asset. A
recent article in Huffington Post had this to say:
Millennials, assisted by a cadre of impressively socially awkward Bitcoin
startup VC types, are piling intellectual and financial capital into this whole
cryptocurrency idea—Bitcoin, Ethereum, all of it. What “e-” in front of any
noun did for techie investor excitement in the 1990s, “crypto” and
“blockchain” seems to be doing today.
Are millennials turning to bitcoin and cryptoassets for their
investments? Is a Vanguard fund or a small investment in
Apple any better? Whereas the Vanguard fund has a minimum
investment amount and buying an equity will require a
commission, millennials see cryptoasset markets as a way to
begin investing with a modest amount of money and in small
6
7

increments, which is often not possible with stocks or funds.
The important point is that at least they’re doing something
to invest their funds and build the groundwork for a healthy
financial future. We have seen firsthand millennials who have
learned about investing from buying cryptoassets and have
implemented investing approaches, such as taking profits at
certain price points, seeking diversification into multiple
assets, and so on. A local bitcoin meetup will include not only
computer nerds discussing hash rates and the virtues of proof-
of-work vs. proof-of-stake, but also deep and financially sound
discussions among participants of various ages about recent
cryptoasset investments.
GOLDILOCKS YEARS OF
CRYPTOASSETS?
We may be at a point where millennials recognize the
opportunity that cryptoassets provide, while most of Wall
Street, including the typical investor, financial advisors, and
the majority of large institutional investors haven’t jumped on
the cryptoassets bandwagon. But they are watching. Certain
large investors are even dipping their toes in, implying an
increase in investment vehicles could be around the corner.
Institutional money managers stepping up to cryptoassets
and creating investment vehicles will have a huge impact on
the awareness of these assets within a wider population of
investors. The need to fund these investment vehicles will also
impact the demand for cryptoassets, potentially putting
significant upward price pressure on the associated markets.
The benefits to the innovative investor who is already well
8

positioned with a cryptoasset portfolio could be substantial. It
should be noted that when more institutions become involved,
and more information outlets come to life, the cryptoasset
markets will become more competitive. Right now, a well-
educated and astute innovative investor still has an edge in the
cryptoasset markets. That may not always be the case.
We’re in a Goldilocks period for cryptoassets, where the
infrastructure and regulation has matured considerably, but
most of Wall Street and institutional investors have yet to
enter the fray. Therefore, there’s still an informational and
trading edge for the astute innovative investor who enters
these markets now. This is a chance to get onboard before the
entirety of the investing world wakes up to this opportunity.
Taking the step forward with the knowledge we’ve provided
and a firm grasp on one’s financial plans, goals, and objectives
will be what separates an innovative investor from the typical
investor.
BEING AN INNOVATIVE AND EVER-
LEARNING INVESTOR
Along with skyrocketing all-time highs, the number of
cryptoassets available has surged. The growth of ICOs, and
resultant proliferation, has gone beyond what any reporter or
follower of this industry can keep up with. Cryptoassets are a
moving target. While this is true for any asset class and any
investment, the cryptoasset target moves faster than most.
That’s why we’ve armed the innovative investor with the
ability to understand and evaluate these assets through
historical context and time-tested investment tools and

techniques, such as modern portfolio theory and asset
allocation.
Innovative investors are active participants in their financial
future, but this doesn’t mean they must be alone on that
journey. Relying on the advice of financial professionals can
be effective because they can provide research and direction.
Yet while innovative investors may take advice from
experienced professionals, the final decisions are their own.
They adapt their investing approach, strategies, and even
selections based on what is occurring around them. This is
especially vital in the age of exponential change that we’re
living in.
Buy and hold works, until it doesn’t. Investing for the long
term works until there’s a need for income in retirement.
Times change. The markets go up and the markets go down,
sometimes in drastic ways. Situations change. A sick relative
or job loss can create havoc with any financial plan.
Innovative investors are all about choosing their own
investing philosophy, their own investing approach, and
having their own viewpoint on what is a suitable investment
for their own situation. It’s not about dismissing the opinions
of others; rather it’s about evaluating the advice of others from
a solid, educated, and informed base of knowledge.
We’ve taken the innovative investor on a trip through the
world of cryptoassets and its colorful history, one that’s still
being written. It’s a fascinating world to be a part of, and for
those new to it, we hope that we’ve provided a good entry
point. For those already part of this world, we hope we’ve
expanded the view. We’re excited about the opportunity it
provides not only for investors but for the larger community as

well.
We believe that when Satoshi was creating Bitcoin, he was
also creating a view of the future. We hope that with this book
we’ve been able to elucidate that future just a little more and
provide you a means to be part of it—because that future is
here.

1.   Network value = (units of the asset outstanding) × ($
value per asset). This is often referred to as the market
capitalization of an asset on many current resources, but
the authors prefer this term as more accurately conveying
the total value of a cryptoasset.

8.   MoIP is a riff off the term “VoIP,” which stands for
Voice-over-Internet-Protocol. Skype, FaceTime, and
Google Hangouts are all examples of VoIP.
9.   Remember that a coinbase transaction goes to the miner
that discovered the block through the proof-of-work
process.
10.   As more machines are dedicated to mine on the network,
there are more “guesses” at the solution to the PoW
puzzle, which means the solution will be guessed more
quickly if the difficulty of the problem is not increased.
Keeping a steady cadence of 10 minutes for blocks means
that transactions will be incorporated into Bitcoin’s
blockchain in a timely manner, and it also mathematically
meters the supply issuance of bitcoin.
11.   Here the term refers to the transaction in a block that pays
the miner, whereas it is most commonly associated with a
company called Coinbase.
12.   Astute investors may realize that the halving doesn’t
happen exactly every four years. The reason for this is
because if lots of machines are being added to the mining
network, then block times will average faster than 10
minutes before the difficulty is reset again. This speeds
up the time between every 210,000 blocks.

meaning dividends were reinvested to show in total how
an investor’s wealth would have grown. Market indices
were used, as opposed to ETFs, because these indices do

because many of these entities are mining pools that are
actually composed of many entities. Therefore, the
decentralization is actually much greater than registers
through such network analysis.

14.   To measure the days of existence, the following start
dates were used for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Ripple, and
Monero. Bitcoin: 10/31/2008, Satoshi’s white paper
release date. Ethereum: 1/23/2014, Vitalik’s formal
announcement on the Ethereum Blog. Dash: 1/18/2014,
the date the network went live. Ripple: 11/29/2012, the
date Ryan Fugger made an announcement about the new
team working on Ripple. Monero: 4/9/2014, the date
thankful_for_today made an announcement about the
impending launch of “BitMonero.” It should be noted that
Dash’s, Ripple’s and Monero’s start dates are more
lenient than Bitcoin and Ethereum, as work was being
done on all three of these before the chosen start dates,
though because those dates are not easily ascertainable
and to avoid controversy the most accurate announcement
date of the new cryptoasset was used.

24.   Blockchain.info has done some analysis, which is what
makes this an “estimated transaction volume,” because
some of the transactions using Bitcoin’s blockchain are
“change transactions,” which sends a remainder back to a
user and thus needs to be weeded out to get a more
accurate estimation of volume.

confused with the Nasdaq market, which is a true stock
exchange, like the NYSE, where trades are done with
primarily automated systems. The OTC markets consist
of a well-organized group of licensed dealers who set the
price of the assets transacted there. While not as well

known as the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq,
OTCQX is a regulated marketplace, and investments can
only be listed on it if they are sponsored and supported by
companies with high financial standards and disclosures.
