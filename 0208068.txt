ABSTRACT 
A novel theory of consciousness is proposed in this paper. We postulate that consciousness is 
intrinsically connected to quantum spin since the latter is the origin of quantum effects in 
both Bohm and Hestenes quantum formulism and a fundamental quantum process associated 
with the structure of space-time. That is, spin is the “mind-pixel.” The unity of mind is 
presumably achieved by entanglement of the mind-pixels. Applying these ideas to the 
particular structures and dynamics of the brain, we have developed a detailed model of 
quantum consciousness. Experimentally, we have contemplated from the perspective of our 
theory on the possibility of entangling the quantum entities inside the brain with those in an 
external anaesthetic sample and carried out experiments toward that end. We found that 
applying magnetic pulses to the brain when a general anaesthetic sample was placed in 
between caused the brain to feel the effect of said anaesthetic for several hours after the 
treatment as if the test subject had actually inhaled the same. The said effect is consistently 
reproducible on all subjects tested. We further found that drinking water exposed to magnetic 
pulses, laser light, microwave or even flashlight when an anaesthetic sample was placed in 
between also causes consistently reproducible brain effects in various degrees. Further, 
through additional experiments we have verified that the said brain effect is the consequence 
of quantum entanglement between quantum entities inside the brain and those of the chemical 
substance under study induced by the photons of the magnetic pulses or applied lights. With 
the aids of high-precision instruments, we have more recently studied non-local effects in 
simple physics system such as a liquid. We have found that the pH value, temperature and 
gravity of a liquid such as water in the detecting reservoirs can be non-locally affected 
through manipulating a liquid in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former. In 
particular, the pH value changes in the same direction as that being manipulated; the 
temperature can change against that of local environment; and the gravity can change against 
local gravity. Again, these non-local effects are all reproducible and have practical 
applications in many areas. We suggest that they are mediated by quantum entanglement 
between nuclear and/or electron spins in treated water and discuss the profound implications 
of these results. To be more comprehensive, this paper now also includes, as appendices, 
materials on further development of the theory and related topics.

Spin-Mediated Consciousness Theory: Possible Roles of

magnetic Oxygen 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Experimentally, tremendous progress has been made in neuroscience over the last 
several decades. Theoretically, numerous versions of quantum and non-quantum 
consciousness theories have been proposed over the recent years (1-8). But, at this stage 
almost all these theories are speculative and none is commonly accepted. Philosophically, the 
age-old debate about consciousness has intensified like a raging fire (9-11). However, despite 
all these efforts, what is and causes consciousness remains a deep mystery. In this paper, we 
propose a novel theory of consciousness with the hope that it would shed some light on these 
issues. 
 
As further discussed below, spin is a very fundamental quantum process associated 
with the structure of space-time (12-14). Indeed, modern physics leads us right down to the 
microscopic domain of space-time where various models of elementary particles and even 
space-time itself are built with spinors (15). On the other hand, neural membranes are 
saturated with spin-carrying nuclei such as 1H, 13C and 31P. Indeed, both MRI and fMRI are 
based on the abundance of 1H in human body. Neural membranes are matrices of brain 
electrical activities and play vital roles in the normal functions of a conscious brain and their 
major molecular components are phospholipids, proteins and cholesterols. Each phospholipid 
contains 1 31P, 1.8% 13C and over 60 1H its lipid chains. Similarly, neural membrane proteins 
such as ion channels and neural transmitter receptors also contain large clusters of spin-
carrying nuclei. Therefore, we strongly believe that Nature has utilized quantum spin in 
constructing a conscious mind. 
 
Very importantly, we believe that the mechanism of anesthetic action is closely 
related to the inner workings of consciousness. But how general anesthetics work is itself a 
150-year old mystery (16, 17). We have already proposed within the framework of 
conventional neuroscience that anesthetic perturbations of oxygen pathways in both neural 
membranes and proteins are possibly involved in general anesthesia (17). Each O2 contains 
two unpaired valence electrons thus is strongly paramagnetic and at the same time 
chemically reactive as a bi-radical. It is capable of producing a large fluctuating magnetic 
field along its diffusing pathway thus serves as a natural contrast agent in MRI (18). The 
existence of unpaired electrons in stable molecules is very rare indeed. O2 are the only 
paramagnetic specie to be found in large quantities in the brain besides enzyme-produced 
nitric oxide (NO). In addition, O2 is an essential component for energy production in the 
central nervous system.

Both O2 and NO, the latter being a unstable free radical with one unpaired electron 
and a recently discovered small neural transmitter, are well known in spin chemistry - a field 
focused on the study of free-radical mediated chemical reactions where very small magnetic 
energies can change non-equilibrium spin conversion process (19,20). Thus O2 and NO may 
serve as spin-catalysts in consciousness-related neural biochemical reactions such as those 
dual path reactions initiated/driven by free radicals (21). 
 
2. NATURE OF SPIN 
 
Unlike mass and charge that enter a dynamic equation as arbitrary parameters, spin 
reveals itself through the structure of the relativistic quantum equation for fermions such as 
electrons (12). Penrose had considered early on that spin might be more fundamental than 
space-time and invented spinor and twistor algebras for a combinatorial description of space-
time geometry (13, 14). Bohm and Hiley generalized the twistor idea to Clifford algebra as a 
possible basis for describing Bohm’s implicit order (22). Recently various spin foams have 
been formulated as extensions to Penrose’s spin networks for the purpose of constructing a 
consistent theory of quantum gravity (23, 24).  
 
In Hestenes’ geometric picture, the zitterbewegung associated with the spin of the 
Dirac electron is qualitatively shown to be responsible for all known quantum effects of said 
electron and the imagery number i in the Dirac equation is said to be due to electronic spin 
(25). Second, in Bohmian mechanics the quantum potential is responsible for quantum 
effects (26). Salesi and Recami has recently shown that said potential is a pure consequence 
of “internal motion” associated with spin evidencing that the quantum behavior is a direct 
consequence of the fundamental existence of spin (27). Esposito has expanded this result by 
showing that “internal motion” is due to the spin of the particle, whatever its value (28). Very 
recently, Bogan has further expanded these results by deriving a spin-dependent gauge 
transformation between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics and the time-
dependent Shrdinger equation of quantum mechanics that is a function of the quantum 
potential in Bohmian mechanics (29).  Third, Kiehn has shown that the absolute square of the 
wave function could be interpreted as the vorticity distribution of a viscous compressible 
fluid that also indicates that spin is the process driving quantum effects (30). 
 
Many others have also study the nature of spin from both classical and quantum- 
mechanical perspectives (31-33). For example, Newman showed that spin might have a 
classical geometric origin. Galiautdinov has considered a theory of spacetime quanta and 
suggested that spin might manifest the atomic structure of space-time (32). Finkelstein is 
proposing that spin derives from a swap – a projective permutation operator, and the two-
valued spin representation from a deeper 2-valued statistics (33). Sidharth has showed that 
spin is symptomatic of the non-commutative geometry of space-time at the Compton scale of 
a fermion and the three dimensionality of the space result from the spinorial behavior of 
fermions (34-35). He further showed that mathematically an imaginary shift of the spacetime 
coordinate in the Compton scale of a fermion introduces spin ½ into general relativity and 
curvature to the fermion theory (34-35). The reason why an imaginary shift is associated 

 
5
with spin is to be found in the quantum mechanical zitterbewegung within the Compton scale 
and the consequent quantized fractal space-time (34-35). Further, according to Sidharth, a 
fermion is like a Kerr-Newman Black Hole within the Compton scale of which causality and 
locality fails (34-35). 
3. MYSTERY OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA 
 
There is no commonly accepted theory on how general anesthetics work (16,17). 
However, there are two schools of thoughts on the issue. The first and oldest is the “lipid 
theory” which proposes that anesthetics dissolve into cell membranes and produce common 
structural perturbation resulting in depressed function of ion channels and receptors that are 
involved in brain functions (16). The second, more popular and recent theory is the “protein 
theory” which suggests that anesthetics directly interact with membrane proteins such as ion 
channels and receptors that are involved in brain functions. But the protein theory doesn't 
seem to square well with the low affinity and diversity of the general anesthetics. There is no 
direct experimental evidence to support either theory (17). 
 
However, both theoretical and experimental studies have shown that many general 
anesthetics cause changes in membrane structures and properties at or just above the clinical 
concentrations required for anesthesia (16,36-37). Since both O2 and general anesthetics are 
hydrophobic, we have proposed within the framework of conventional neuroscience that 
general anesthetic may cause unconsciousness by perturbing O2 pathway in neural 
membranes and O2-utilizing proteins, such that the availability of O2 to its sites of utilization 
is reduced, which in turn triggers cascading cellular responses through O2-sensing 
mechanisms, resulting in general anesthesia (17). 
 
We have also been asking the question whether anesthetic perturbations of neural 
membranes and oxygen pathways themselves are the direct cause of unconsciousness. This 
conjuncture requires that O2 and neural membranes be directly involved in consciousness. 
Indeed, the low affinity, diversity and pervasiveness of general anesthetics point us to this 
direction. If we assume that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain (9) and 
further liken consciousness to the formation of ice at 0 oC, the anesthetic action would be like 
the action of salt which prevents ice formation. 
 
 
4. NATURE OF CONSCIOSNESS 
 
There is no coherent view as to what is and causes consciousness. Some 
neuroscientists would say that it is the connections between the neurons and the coherent 
firing patterns thereof (2, 6). Some physicists would propose that it is connected to the 
measurement problem in quantum theory and thus the solution lies there (1,3,5,7). A few 
philosophers would suggest that it is an emergent property of the complex brain (9) or a new 
kind of properties and laws are required (11). For sure such disarray has its historical 
reasons. Ever since Descartes promoted his dualism philosophy in the 17th Century, science 
has been for the most part steered clear from this subject until very recently. 

 
6
 
Philosophically, Searle argues that consciousness is an emergent biological 
phenomenon thus cannot be reduced to physical states in the brain (9). Chalmers argues that 
consciousness cannot be explained through reduction, because mind does not belong to the 
realm of matter (11). In order to develop a consciousness theory based on this approach, 
Chalmers suggests expanding science in a way still compatible with today’s scientific 
knowledge and outlines a set of fundamental and irreducible properties to be added to space-
time, mass, charge, spin etc. and a set of laws to be added to the laws of Nature (11). Further, 
he considers that information is the key to link consciousness and the physical world. 
 
On the theoretical front, there are quite a few quantum theories of mind (1,3-5,7,8). 
Among these, Penrose’s Objective Reduction (“OR”) together with Hameroff’s microtubule 
computation is perhaps the most popular, and the combination of the two produced the 
Orchestrated Objective Reduction (“Orch OR”) in microtubules (1,7,8). According to 
Penrose, each quantum state has its own space-time geometry, thus superposition of quantum 
states entails superposition of different space-time geometries (1,7). Under certain 
conditions, such space-time geometric superposition would separate under its own “weight” 
through a non-computable process, which in turn would collapse said quantum state 
superposition (1,7). Hameroff suggested that such self-organized OR could occur in 
microtubules because of their particular structures, thus, born the Orch OR (8). According 
Orch OR, each collapse of macroscopic space-time geometry superposition corresponds to a 
discrete conscious event (8). In addition, it seems that Penrose accepts a separate mental 
world with grounding in the physical world (1,7). 
 
There are also a number of theories based on conventional neuroscience (2,6). Our 
view on these is that whatever the final accepted version based on neuroscience (“classical 
physics”), it could be accepted as classically correct. The reason is that we must rely on the 
classical parts of the brain working according to conventional neuroscience to provide us the 
necessary neural components and wirings such as coherent neural firings, neurotransmitter 
releases and neural plasticity to support any realistic quantum activities of the brain. The 
situation is much like that in quantum computation where classical components form the 
supporting system of a quantum computer. Without these classical components, quantum 
computation could not be implemented at all. 
 
In comparison, our working philosophy is that consciousness is grounded at the 
bottom of physical reality and emerges from the collective dynamics of known physical 
candidates inside the brain. Next we ask “where” and “how.” To answer these, we take the 
reductionist approach both down to the end of physics to see what is left there and to the 
microscopic domain of a neuron to see what may be really important for the functioning of a 
conscious brain. What we found is that there is almost nothing left at the end of physics 
except the fundamental ideas of quantized space-time and spin. On the other hand, we found 
that what may be really important in the microscopic domain of a neuron are the nuclear spin 
ensembles and the fluxes of biologically available unpaired electrons carried by small 
molecules such as O2 and NO. Naturally, we draw the conclusion that quantum spin together 

 
7
with its connection to space-time geometry is needed to ground consciousness in physical 
reality such that conscious experience emerges from the successive collapses of various 
entangled neural nuclear spin states. 
 
Specifically, we try to answer these questions: (1) what are the neural substrates of 
consciousness, (2) what physical processes are involved in conscious experience, (3) what 
physical and biochemical process are involved in connecting consciousness to the classical 
neural networks of the brain and, (4) what binding mechanism allows the mind to achieve 
unity. 
 
 
5. GENERAL POSTULATES 
 
With above discussions in mind, we present the following Postulates: (a) 
Consciousness is intrinsically connected to quantum spin; (b) The mind-pixels of the brain 
are comprised of the nuclear spins distributed in the neural membranes and proteins, the 
pixel-activating agents are comprised of biologically available paramagnetic species such as 
O2 and NO, and the neural memories are comprised of all possible entangled quantum states 
of the mind-pixels; (c) Action potential modulations of nuclear spin interactions input 
information to the mind pixels and spin chemistry is the output circuit to classical neural 
activities; and (d) Consciousness emerges from the collapses of those entangled quantum 
states which are able to survive decoherence, said collapses are contextual, irreversible and 
non-computable and the unity of consciousness is achieved through quantum entanglement 
of the mind-pixels. 
 
In Postulate (a), the relationship between quantum spin and consciousness are defined 
based on the fact that spin is the origin of quantum effects in both Bohm and Hestenes 
quantum formulism (25, 27-29) and a fundamental quantum process associated with the 
structure of space-time (12-14). Combining this fundamental idea with those stated in 
Postulates (b), (c) and (d) allows us to build a qualitatively detailed working model of 
consciousness as discussed later. 
 
In Postulate (b), we specify that the nuclear spins in both neural membranes and 
neural proteins serve as the mind-pixels and propose that biologically available paramagnetic 
species such as O2 and NO are the mind-pixel activating agents. We also propose that neural 
memories are comprised of all possible entangled quantum states of mind-pixels. This 
concept of memory is an extension to the associative memory in neuroscience as will be 
discussed later. 
 
 
 
In Postulate (c), we propose the input and output circuits for the mind-pixels. As 
shown in a separate paper, the strength and anisotropies of nuclear spin interactions through 
J-couplings and dipolar couplings are modulated by action potentials. Thus, the neural spike 
trains can directly input information into the mind-pixels made of neural membrane nuclear 
spins.  Further, spin chemistry can serve as the bridge to the classical neural activity since 

 
8
biochemical reactions mediated by free radicals are very sensitive to small changes of 
magnetic energies as mentioned earlier and further discussed later (19-21). 
 
In Postulate (d), we propose how conscious experience emerges. Since there are 
several interpretations of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we choose to 
accept the collapsing view (1,7). Thus, we adopt a quantum state collapsing scheme from 
which conscious experience emerges as a set of collapses of the decoherence-resistant 
entangled quantum states. We further theorize that the unity of consciousness is achieved 
through quantum entanglements of these mind-pixels (5). 
 
 
6. ILLUSTRATIONS OF SPIN-MEDIATED CONSCIOUSNESS 
 
Overview 
 
Figure 1 is a highly schematic drawing of the overall picture of a spin-mediated 
consciousness model proposed herein. At the top of Figure 1, a two-neuron network is 
shown. The connections are self-explanatory. The neural activities of the postsynaptic 
membrane are immediately shown below the neurons in Figure 1. These activities include 
biochemical reactions immediately following the release of neurotransmitters into the 
synaptic cleft, the ensuing collective activities of multiple ion channels and the action 
potentials and their propagations thereof, and other enzymatic activities. 
 
The present model is mainly concerned with the dynamics of the nuclear spin 
ensembles in neural membranes and proteins such as those on the dendrites and soma under 
modulations by action potentials and activations by paramagnetic species such as rapidly 
tumbling and diffusing O2 and neural transmitter NO, and the connections of such dynamics 
to conscious experience. The input and out interface of the neural nuclear spin ensembles are 
schematically shown in the middle of Figure 1. On the bottom of Figure 1, what the 
conscious brain perceives is schematically shown. The neural substrates and mechanism of 
the spin-mediated consciousness are described below. 
 
Nuclear spin ensembles 
 
Figure 2 shows side-by-side a typical phospholipid found in neural membranes 
together with the diffusing O2. A similar but much complex picture can be drawn for a neural 
protein. As can be seen, each phospholipid molecule contains 1 31P, less than 1 13C (1.1%) 
and more than 60 1H on its two lipid chains. Because the small mobility of nuclei and weak 
interactions of nuclear spins with their environments, nuclear spins have long relaxation time 
after excitations (18). This property of nuclear spins is ideal for them to serve as the mind-
pixels. Importantly, these nuclear spins can form various intra/inter-molecularly entangled 
quantum states under different external activations through J-couplings and dipolar coupling 
(38-40).

the part dealing with conscious experience See text for detailed explanations.  
 
Activation Agents 
 
The unpaired electrons attached to the paramagnetic species such as O2 and NO can 
interact with nuclear spins through their large magnetic dipoles and collision-induced Fermi-
contact mechanism (41) thus activating the neural nuclear spin ensembles. Indeed, because 
the magnetic dipole moment of an unpaired electron is 658 times larger than that of the 1H 
nucleus, O2 and NO can respectively produce magnetic fields 1,316 and 658 times larger 
than 1H (41). In addition, O2 and NO are hydrophobic small molecules so their 
concentrations in neural membranes are much higher than in aqueous solutions such as 
cytoplasma (42). Thus, as they rapidly tumble and diffuse, they produce microscopically 
strong and fluctuating magnetic fields. O2 are the predominant sources of internal magnetic 

 
10
fields in neural membranes as evidenced by the strong effect of O2 on spin-spin and spin-
lattice relaxation rates (42,43).

phospholipid with diffusing O2 in Lewis structure (b) and atomic model (d) shown along the side. 
Two unpaired electronic electrons of O2 are shown in Lewis structure as two red dots (b). In the 
atomic model, the white, black, purple and orange balls respectively represent hydrogen, carbon, 
oxygen and phosphonium atoms. 1H, 13C and 31P are spin-carrying nuclei. 
 
Spin-mediated mechanism 
 
The mechanism of spin-mediated consciousness is concisely stated here and the 
related issues such as decoherence effect are treated in next subsection. Through action 
potential modulated nuclear spin interactions and paramagnetic O2/NO driven activations the 
nuclear spins inside neural membranes and proteins form various entangled spin states some 
of which survive rapid decoherence through quantum Zeno effects or in decoherence-free 
subspaces and then collapse contextually through non-computabe and irreversible means thus 
producing consciousness and, in turn, the collective spin dynamics associated with said 
collapses have effects through spin chemistry on classical neural activities thus influencing 
the classical neural networks of the brain. Our proposal calls for extension of associative 
encoding of neural memories to the dynamical structures of neural membranes and proteins. 
 
Therefore, according to the present theory, (a) the dynamical nuclear spin ensembles 
are the “mind-screen” with nuclear spins as its pixels, (b) the neural membranes and proteins 
are the mind-screen and memory matrices; and (c) the fluxes of biologically available 
paramagnetic O2/NO are the beam for pixel-activations. Together, they form the neural 

 
11
substrates of consciousness. An analogy to this is the mechanism of liquid crystal display 
(LCD) where information-carrying electric voltages applied to the pixel cells change the 
optical properties of the constituent molecules such that when lights pass through these cells 
their phases get rotated differently which in turn represent different information to the viewer 
of the LCD screen (44). 
 
Quantum coherence and decoherence 
 
The decoherence effect which causes a quantum system to lose quantum coherence 
through interactions with its environment is a major concern for any quantum theory of the 
brain and is hotly debated (45-46). However, nuclear spins only have weak interactions with 
their environments thus long relaxation time after excitation (18). Indeed, there are both 
theoretical and experimental studies (38-40, 47-50) indicating the possibility of large-scale 
quantum coherence with entanglement in the nuclear spin ensembles distributed in the neural 
membranes and proteins. Paradoxally, the interactions of the neural membrane nuclear spin 
ensembles with their noisy brain environments may even enhance quantum coherence 
through quantum Zeno effect which prevents a quantum system to evolve/decohere through 
repeated collisions with their environments (5). Further, studies show that decoherence-free 
subspaces can exist within the Hilbert space of a complex quantum system (51). 
 
In a series of experiments, Khitrin et al have demonstrated that a cluster of dipolar 
coupled to 1H nuclear spins in the molecules of a nematic liquid crystal at room temperature 
can be manipulated to achieve long-lived intra-molecular quantum coherence with 
entanglement such that a large amount of information may be stored in said cluster (38-40). 
In particular, they have succeeded in storing at room temperature a 2D pattern consisting of 
1025 bits of information in the proton nuclear spin states of a molecular system of said 
nematic liquid crystal and then retrieved the same as a stack of NMR spectra (38-40). 
 
Second, about a decade ago Warren et al discovered long-ranged intermolecular 
multiple-quantum coherence in NMR spectroscopy and imaging and have since successfully 
applied said coherence as MRI contrast agents (47-48). Indeed, they found that even the 
intermolecular dipolar couplings of the nuclear spins at distances larger than 10 microns are 
not averaged away by diffusions (47-48). 
 
Third, Julsgaard et al have first theoretically predicted and then experimentally 
demonstrated at room temperature a long-lived entanglement of two macroscopic spin 
ensembles formed by two caesium gas samples each of which contains about 1012 atoms 
(49). The entangled spin-state can be maintained for 0.5 milliseconds and was generated via 
interactions of the samples with a pulse of light (49). The state they demonstrated is not a 
maximally entangled “Schrödinger cat” state but a state similar to a two-mode squeezed 
state; thus, it is an example of a non-maximally entangled state (49). In addition, Kun et al 
have theoretically predicted a “Schrödinger cat” state to be found in highly-excited and 
strongly-interacting many-body system (50). 
 

 
12
These results apparently contradict the claim that there is no large-scale quantum 
coherence in the noisy brain (45). At least, this claim does not seem to apply to the nuclear 
spin ensembles in neural membranes and proteins. Further, in the case of Penrose-Hameroff 
microtubule model (8), it was strongly argued by Hagan et al that Tegmark’s theoretical 
calculations also do not apply there (46). Indeed, even if we assume this claim is true, 
consciousness can still emerge from the statistical mixtures of coherent and incoherent 
quantum states of the mind pixels, as long as we either accept some kind of emergence 
theory (9) or take a dualistic approach (4,11) as will be discussed again later. 
 
“Consciousness explained” 
 
The explanation of consciousness in accordance with our spin-mediated theory is 
schematically shown at the bottom of Figure 1. The geometry inside the spinning circle 
represents conscious experience and is part of a Penrose tiling (1). It symbolizes that 
consciousness emerges from the non-computable collapses of entangled quantum states of 
the mind-pixels under the influence of spacetime dynamics schematically shown as the 
spinning circle. The edges in the Penrose tiling represent the nuclear spins in neural 
membranes and proteins as mind-pixels, the nodes represent interactions between these 
nuclear spins through J-couplings and dipolar couplings and the colors represent activations 
of mind-pixels by biologically available paramagnetic species such as O2 and NO. The whole 
tiling pattern in Figure 1 represents conscious experience and the underlying spacetime 
geometry. This pattern successively evolves under repeated activations by the paramagnetic 
species representing successive collapses of the entangled quantum states of the mind-pixels 
that have survived decoherence as a stream of conscious experience. 
 
We adopt Penrose’s long-standing view that human thought may involve non-
computable processes, as Gödel's theorem of incompleteness would suggest (1,7). According 
to Gödel, any consistent system of axioms beyond a certain basic level of complexity yields 
statements that cannot be proved or disproved with said axioms. Yet human can decide 
whether those statements are true, thus human thought cannot be reduced to a set of rules or 
computations (1,7). So where can one find non-computable process in physics? Obviously it 
cannot be found in classical physics because classical physics is deterministic so, in 
principle, can be simulated by a computer (1,7). Thus, Penrose reasoned that some kind of 
non-computable quantum process must be involved in consciousness and further suggested 
gravity-induced reduction (“R”) process of quantum state superposition to be the candidate  
(1,7). One may recall that, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, gravity is 
space-time geometry and, further, as we have discussed before quantum mechanical spin is 
associated with the structure of space-time. Therefore, the quantum state of spin must be 
connected to the underlying space-time geometry. However, we still have the task of 
working out the details in future research. This will be especially difficult because at the 
present we do not have a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity.

Alternative approaches to consciousness 
 
If we assume that there is no large-scale quantum coherence in the noisy brain 
because of decoherence (45), how can consciousness still emerge from the statistically mixed 
quantum states of the nuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes and proteins? There are 
indeed at least two ways out. The first is to adopt an emergence theory (9) and the second is 
to take a dualistic approach (4, 11). Here, we will focus our discussion on the dualistic 
approach. 
 
In such approach we can propose that mind has its own independent existence and 
reside in a pre-space-time domain. Then, the question becomes how does mind process and 
harness the information from the brain so that it can have conscious experience? We can 
theorize that conscious experience emerges from those quantum states of the mind-pixels in 
the statistical mixtures that have grabbed the attention of the mind through quantum Zeno 
effect (5) or some non-local means in pre-space-time. Indeed, the many-mind interpretation 
of quantum theory as proposed by Donald supports this type of formulation (3). Thus, in this 
scenario, mind does not depend on large quantum coherence to work. 
 
Furthermore, each nuclear spin is a quantum bit, each O2 spin triplet is tightly 
entangled two-qubit and there exist coherent and incoherent intra-molecular superpositions 
of multiple nuclear spins under external stimulations (38-40). So, it is plausible that mind 
could utilize quantum statistical computations similar to those proposed in by Castagnoli and 
Finkelstein (52). In their model, a triode network made of triplet pairs of spin ½ fermions and 
their quantum statistical relations due to particle indistinguishability was utilized to 
implement the computation, together with a randomly-varying magnetic field as heat bath for 
annealing (52). The scheme develops quantum parallelism through the incoherent 
superposition of parallel computation paths (i.e., the mixtures). It replaces the superposition 
of coherent parallel computation paths with the almost indestructible superposition of 
different permutations of identical particles subject to a given statistics thus surviving 
decoherence (52). 
 
Associative memory model 
 
We have proposed that neural memories are comprised of all possible entangled 
quantum states of the nuclear spins inside neural membranes and proteins. This proposal 
calls for extension of the existing associative memory concept in neuroscience to include all 
possible conformations of neural membranes and proteins in a single neuron (53). A few 
illustrations are given here. Figure 3 (a) schematically shows a patch of neural membrane 
containing only the same phospholipids. Such a membrane is much like a blank tape. Figure 
3 (b) shows the same neural membrane after cholesterols are added. The changes in 
membrane configuration are quite noticeable (54-55). These changes can represent memory 
or information. Figure 3 (c) shows the chemical structure and atomic model of a stearic acid 

 
14
molecule - a saturated fatty acid. Figure 3 (d) shows the chemical structure and atomic model 
of oleic acid molecule – an unsaturated fatty acid. The only difference between the two fatty 
acids is that the latter contains a double bond in the middle that causes its kink formation 
when the double bond is the cis form. When the double bond is in the trans form, the chain is 
doubly bent so there is no kink. Certainly insert either one of the fatty acids into the 
membrane shown in Figure 3 (b) would further increase its complexity thus information 
content. Furthermore, insertions of proteins to neural membranes also significantly change 
their conformation and dynamics surrounding the inserted proteins (56). Thus, inserting 
different proteins to neural membranes both in numbers and types can significantly increase 
the information content of the neural membranes.

structure and atomic model of a stearic acid molecule and d shows the chemical structure and atomic 
model of oleic acid molecule.  
 
            Input and output circuits 
 
We have suggested that action potential modulations of nuclear spin interactions 
input information to the mind pixels and spin chemistry is the output circuit to classical 
neural activities. With respect to the input circuit, published studies show that the dynamics 
of membrane proteins significantly affect the dynamics of surrounding membranes (53,56). 
Secondly, due to the very small thickness of the neural membrane (~10 nm), even the small 
voltage (~50 mV) of an action potential can create enormous oscillating electric field inside 
the neural membranes that in turn can affect the conformations and dynamics of the 
membrane components such as phospholipid and proteins (57-58). Indeed, the strength and 

 
15
anisotropies of nuclear spin interactions through J-couplings and dipolar couplings are 
modulated by action potentials as will be shown in a separate paper. Thus, the neural spike 
trains can directly input information into the mind-pixels made of neural membrane nuclear 
spins. 
 
Secondly, the weak magnetic field produced collectively by all neural activities may 
also directly serve as the input. However, the magnitude of said magnetic field is only in the 
order of 10-12 Tesla (59). In comparison, O2 and NO can produce a fluctuating local magnetic 
field as high as a few Tesla according to our own calculations. Thus, the effect of said weak 
magnetic field on the dynamics of mind-pixels is probably small unless non-linear processes 
such as stochastic resonance are involved. 
 
Further, we have already pointed out earlier that spin chemistry can serve as the 
output circuit to classical neural activities because biochemical reactions mediated by free 
radicals are very sensitive to small changes of magnetic energies as discussed previously. 
Indeed, many biochemical reactions mediated by radical pairs and biradicals, such as those 
dual path radical reactions driven/initiated by NO and active oxygen species, have been 
found to be influenced by the magnetic field in their local environment (19,20). Thus, the 
functional output of the mind-pixels, being the varying local magnetic field generated by the 
dynamics of the nuclear spin ensembles as mind-pixels, can directly affect classical neural 
activities. Further, there may be other mechanisms through which the mind-pixels can 
influence the classical neural activities of the brain. 
 
Mechanism of anesthetic action 
 
As mentioned earlier in this paper, the mechanism of anesthetic action is closely 
related to the inner workings of consciousness (17). We describe here said mechanism in 
accordance with our spin-mediated theory. Figure 4  (a) schematically shows the normal 
diffusion of O2 and NO without anesthetics dissolved into the neural membranes and 
proteins. As these molecules rapidly diffuse through the membranes, they collide with the 
neural membrane components and generate strong and fluctuating internal magnetic fields 
thus activating the nuclear spin ensembles inside these membranes.  Figure 4 (b) 
schematically shows anesthetic perturbations of O2 and NO pathways and neural membranes 
themselves by anesthetic molecules and the resulting distortion and/or obstruction of these 
pathways. Such perturbations render O2 and NO not able to perform their normal activation 
functions thus resulting in unconsciousness.

perturbations of O2 pathways and neural membranes themselves. 
 
 
7. PREDICTIONS AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE 
 
Several experimentally verifiable predictions can be drawn from our spin-mediated 
consciousness theory: (1) Significant replacement of 1H with 2H will affect or disrupt 
consciousness; (2) Significant external disturbances to the dynamics of the nuclear spin 
ensembles in neural membranes and proteins will interfere with normal conscious functions; 
(3) Significant drug-induced disturbances to the structure and dynamics of the neural 
membranes and protein themselves will affect or disrupt consciousness; (4) Significant drug-
induced disturbances to the O2 pathways inside the neural membranes will diminish or block 
consciousness; and (5) Significant lack of O2 in neural membranes will directly affect or 
disrupt consciousness even if everything else in the brain functions normally. Of course, 
other predictions and inferences can also be drawn from the present theory. But we will focus 
our discussions on the above listed a few to see whether there are any experimental evidence 
supporting these predictions. 
 
With respect to prediction (1), there are published results concerning the biological 
effects of heavy water (2H2O or D2O) that lend indirect support to our proposals (60). Indeed, 
the only observable physical and chemical difference between regular and heavy water is that 
the latter has a slightly higher viscosity (60). It was reported that rats restricted to heavy 
water (99.8%) would drink it freely the first day, then drank progressively less and died 
within 14 days (62). It was also reported that the incremental increase of the amount of heavy 
water in regular drinking water lengthened the 24-hour clock of the Circadian rhythm in 
blind hamsters or normal hamsters kept in constant darkness (62). In principle, these 
observations can be explained as animals literally loosing their minds because of the loss of 
their mind-pixels due to gradual 2H substitutions of 1H in neural membranes and proteins.  
The complication is that the higher viscosity of heavy water might have also contributed to 

 
17
the observed effects. It is possible to design an experimental procedure to either account for 
or exclude those effects attributable to the higher viscosity. 
 
With respect to prediction (2), there are also quite a few published studies based on 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) that can be at least partially explained based on 
our theory (63,64), although common wisdom is that TMS induces electrical currents in the 
brain, causing depolarization of cellular membranes and thereby neural activation (63). It has 
been found that depending on the locations of stimulation TMS affects the test subject’s 
verbal ability, visualization and other conscious functions  (64). According to our theory, 
TMS can directly affect the dynamics of nuclear spin ensembles in neural membranes and 
proteins which in turn result in altered, diminished and/or disrupted conscious functions of 
the brain. 
 
With respect to predictions (3) and (4), many general anesthetics have been found to 
disturb the structures and dynamics of neural membranes (16,36,37). Thus, the mechanism of 
their action can be interpreted, according our spin-mediated theory, as caused by their direct 
effects on O2 pathways and nuclear spin ensembles inside the neural membranes and 
proteins. Our other paper contains a detailed treatment on anesthetic perturbations of oxygen 
pathways and membranes themselves (17). Here we will focus on one particularly small 
anesthetic agent, the nitrous oxide (N2O), also known as the laughing gas. Indeed, the size of 
N2O is similar to that of O2 but it does not contain unpaired electrons and is not reactive.  It 
has low polarity that makes it soluble in both water and lipid. Thus, it can be carried to the 
brain through blood stream and accumulate in the neural membranes. Inhalation of N2O will 
cause disorientation, euphoria, numbness and ultimately loss of consciousness if the 
inhalation dosage is high. The cellular mechanism of these actions by N2O is so far unknown 
but seems confined to postsynaptic targets (65). On the other hand, its closely related 
“cousin” NO contains one unpaired electron and has been discovered as the first small and 
highly diffusive neural transmitter produced in the brain through enzymatic reactions (66). 
According to our theory, there indeed exist a natural and straightforward explanation. By 
dissolving into neural membranes in an inhalation-dose-dependent fashion, N2O gradually 
displace O2 in the neural membranes thus diminish or disrupt the activating function of O2. 
 
With respect to prediction (5), it is probably very hard to deprive brain O2 and yet at 
the same time require its neurons to keep their metabolic functions normal since O2 is an 
essential component of brain energy production. However, according to our theory in the 
case of temporary-hypoxia-induced unconsciousness such as that due to sudden loss of air 
pressure on an airplane, the actually cause may not be the depletion of brain energy resources 
because of the lack of O2 but the direct loss of O2 as the activating agents. 
 
Now, we briefly turn our attention to the associative memory model proposed herein. 
There are tens of thousands of research papers on the subject of synaptic 
plasticity/modification (67). The commonly accepted assumption in neuroscience is that 
synaptic efficacy is both necessary and sufficient to account for learning and memory (53). 
Our associative memory model does not conflict with the synaptic efficacy view but extend it 

 
18
to the sub-neural and microscopic domain. Studies show that neural activities modify not 
only the synaptic efficacy but also the intrinsic properties of the neuron (53). 
 
 
8. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Our working philosophy in this paper has been that consciousness is grounded at the 
bottom of physical reality and emerges from the collective dynamics of known physical 
candidates inside the brain. We strongly believe that quantum spins are such candidates 
because they are one of the most fundamental entities in modern physics and, on the other 
hand, neural membranes and proteins are saturated with spin-carrying nuclei. We have 
applied reductionist approaches in both physics and neuroscience to reach our tentative 
conclusions. However, our theory as it stands now is speculative and only qualitatively 
detailed. We are building a quantitative model and the results will be reported in the near 
future. We have made important predictions from our theory and presented experimental 
evidence in support of the same. We have also suggested new experiments to verify the 
present proposals. Indeed, recent experimental realizations of intra-/inter-molecular nuclear 
spin coherence and entanglement, macroscopic entanglement of spin ensembles and NMR 
quantum computation, all in room temperatures, strongly suggest the possibility of a spin-
mediated mind. 
 
At this point, one crucial question the reader may ask is how can we explain that 
cognitive functions seem in general insensitive to environmental and even medical strength 
external magnetic fields such as those used in MRI? First, the strengths of environmental 
magnetic fields are in the range of 10-4 –10-6 Tesla (68). In comparison, the internal 
fluctuating magnetic fields can be as high as several Tesla as we have estimated in a separate 
paper. Thus, the internal magnetic fields overshadow the environmental ones. But the 
strengths of magnetic fields used in MRI are in the range of 0.064 to 8.0 Tesla (69) that is 
comparable to or even higher than the strengths of the internal magnetic fields. So additional 
explanations are called for. Indeed, the net magnetization of nuclear spins even by magnetic 
field of several Tesla is only about a few ppm at room temperature (70) which shows that 
even strong static magnetic fields only have small effects on the thermal dynamics of the 
neural nuclear spin ensembles. Third, to the extent that said spin ensembles are disturbed by 
external magnetic fields, it is argued that most of these disturbances do not represent 
meaningful information to the brain and, further, the brain likely have developed other 
mechanisms through evolution to counter the effects of most external disturbances. In the 
cases where external magnetic disturbances were reported to have observable cognitive 
effects, the above suggestion provides a possible basis for interpreting these effects as the 
results of said disturbances either too large or containing meaningful information to the 
brain. 
 
However, we would like to caution that even if our theory is confirmed partly or as a 
whole by more experiments it will only mark the beginning of a new direction towards a 
better understanding of consciousness. There are so many questions need to be answered, 

 
19
especially those “hard problems” (11). For example, what are the roles of the nuclear spins 
carried by different nuclei such as 1H, 13C and 31P? Do they represent different emotions or 
feeling of our mind? What are the roles of different biologically available paramagnetic 
species such as O2 and neural transmitter NO?  Do they activate different perceptions of 
mind? 
 
In conclusion, we have proposed a novel theory of consciousness in which quantum 
spins play the central role as mind-pixels and the unity of mind is achieved by entanglement 
of these mind-pixels. To justify such a choice, we have shown that spin is the origin of 
quantum effects in both Bohm and Hestenes quantum formulism and a fundamental quantum 
process associated with the structure of space-time. Applying these ideas to the particular 
structures and dynamics of the brain, we have theorized how consciousness emerges from the 
collapse of the decoherence-resistant entangled spin states via contextual, non-computable 
and irreversible processes. We have suggested that these entangled spin states are formed 
through action potential modulated nuclear spin interactions and paramagnetic O2/NO driven 
activations and survive rapid decoherence through quantum Zeno effects or in decoherence-
free subspaces We have further suggested that the collective spin dynamics associated with 
said collapses have effects through spin chemistry on classical neural activities thus 
influencing the neural networks of the brain. Our proposals imply the extension of 
associative encoding of neural memories to the dynamical structures of neural membranes 
and proteins. Therefore, according our theory the neural substrates of consciousness are 
comprised of the following: (a) nuclear spin ensembles embedded in neural membranes and 
proteins which serve as the “mind-screen” with nuclear spins as the pixels, (b) the neural 
membranes and proteins themselves which serve as the matrices for the mind-screen and 
neural memories; and (c) the biologically available paramagnetic species such as O2 and NO 
which serve as the pixel-activating agents.

Photon Induced Non-local Effects of General Anesthetics 
 
 
on the Brain 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Photons are intrinsically quantum objects and natural long-distance carriers of 
information in both classical and quantum communications (1). Since brain functions involve 
information and many experiments have shown that quantum entanglement is physically real, 
we have contemplated from the perspective of our herein described hypothesis (2) on the 
possibility of entangling the quantum entities inside the brain with those in an external 
anesthetic sample and carried out experiments toward that end. Indeed, Quantum 
entanglement is ubiquitous in the microscopic world and manifests itself macroscopically 
under some circumstances (3, 4). Further, quantum spins of electrons and photons have now 
been successfully entangled in various ways for the purposes of quantum computation, 
memory and communication (5, 6). In the field of neuroscience, we have suggested that 
nuclear and/or electronic spins inside the brain may play important roles in certain aspects of 
brain functions such as perception (2). Arguably, we could test our hypothesis by first 
attempting to entangle these spins with those of a chemical substance such as a general 
anesthetic and then observing the resulting brain effects such attempt may produce, if any. 
Indeed, instead of armchair debate on how the suggested experiments might not work, we 
just went ahead and carried out the experiments over the periods of more than a year. Here, 
we report our results. We point out from the outset that although it is commonly believed that 
quantum entanglement alone cannot be used to transmit classical information, the function of 
the brain may not be totally based on classical information (2). 
 
Here we report that applying magnetic pulses to the brain when a general anesthetic 
sample was placed in between caused the brain to feel the effect of said anesthetic for several 
hours after the treatment as if the test subject had actually inhaled the same. The said effect is 
consistently reproducible on all four subjects tested. We further found that drinking water 
exposed to magnetic pulses, laser light, microwave or even flashlight when an anesthetic 
sample was placed in between also causes consistently reproducible brain effects in various 
degrees. We have in addition tested several medications including morphine and obtained 
consistently reproducible results. Further, through additional experiments we have verified 
that the said brain effect is the consequence of quantum entanglement between quantum 
entities inside the brain and those of the chemical substance under study induced by the 
photons of the magnetic pulses or applied lights. We suggest that the said quantum entities 
inside the brain are nuclear and/or electron spins and discuss the profound implications of 
these results.

2. METHODS, TEST SUBJECTS & MATERIALS 
 
Figure 1A shows a typical setup for the first set of experiments. It includes a 
magnetic coil with an estimated 20W output placed at one inch above the right side of a test 
subject’s forehead, a small flat glass-container inserted between the magnetic coil and the 
forehead, and an audio system with adjustable power output and frequency spectrum controls 
connected to the magnetic coil. When music is played on the audio system, the said magnetic 
coil produces magnetic pulses with frequencies in the range of 5Hz to10kHz. Experiments 
were conducted with said container being filled with different general anaesthetics, 
medications, or nothing/water as control, and the test subject being exposed to the magnetic 
pulses for 10min and not being told the content in the container or details of the experiments. 
The indicators used to measure the brain effect of said treatment were the first-person 
experiences of any unusual sensations such as numbness, drowsiness and/or euphoria which 
the subject felt after the treatment and the relative degrees of these unusual sensations on a 
scale of 10 with 0=nothing, 1=weak, 2=light moderate, 3=moderate, 4=light strong, 
5=strong, 6=heavily strong, 7=very strong, 8=intensely strong, 9=extremely strong and 
10=intolerable. The durations of the unusual sensations and other symptoms after the 
treatment such as nausea or headache were also recorded.

Figure 2A shows a typical setup for the second set of experiments. It includes the 
magnetic coil connected to the audio system, a large flat glass-container filled with 200ml 
fresh tap water and the small flat glass-container inserted between the magnetic coil and 
larger glass-container. Figure 3A shows a typical setup for the second set of experiments 
when a red laser with a 50mW output and wavelengths of 635nm – 675nm was used. All 
Experiments were conducted in the dark with the small flat glass-container being filled with 
different general anaesthetics, medications, or nothing/water as control, the large glass-
container being filled with 200ml fresh tap water and exposed to the magnetic pulses or laser 
light for 30min and the test subject consuming the treated tap water but not being told the 
content in the small container or details of the experiments. The indicators used for 
measuring the brain effects were the same as those used in the first set of experiments. 
Experiments were also carried out respectively with a 1200W microwave oven and a 

 
22
flashlight powered by two size-D batteries. When the microwave oven was used, a glass tube 
containing 20ml fresh tap water was submerged into a larger glass tube containing 50ml 
general anaesthetic and exposed to microwave radiation for 5sec. The said procedure was 
repeated for multiple times to collect a total of 200ml treated tap water for consumption. 
When the flashlight was used, the magnetic coil shown in Figure 2 was replaced with the 
flashlight.

device. 
 
To verify that the brain effects experienced by the test subjects were the 
consequences of quantum entanglement between quantum entities inside the brain and those 
in the chemical substances under study, the following additional experiments were carried 
out. Figure 4A shows a typical setup of the entanglement verification experiments. The setup 

 
23
is the reverse of the setup shown in Figure 3A. In addition, the small flat glass-container with 
a chemical substance or nothing/water as control was positioned with an angle to the 
incoming laser light to prevent reflected laser light from re-entering the large glass-container. 
 
 
Figure 4A. Photograph of a setup for the entanglement verification experiments. 
 
In the first set of entanglement verification experiments, the laser light from the red 
laser first passed through the large glass-container with 200ml fresh tap water and then 
through the small flat glass-container filled with a chemical substance or nothing/water as 
control located about 300cm away. After 30min of exposure to the laser light, a test subject 
consumed the exposed tap water without being told the content in the small container or 
details of the experiments and reported the brain effects felt for the next several hours. 
 
In the second set of entanglement verification experiments, 400ml fresh tap water in a 
glass-container was first exposed to the radiation of the magnetic coil for 30min or that of the 
1500W microwave oven for 2min. Then the test subject immediately consumed one-half of 
the water so exposed.  After 30min from the time of consumption the other half was exposed 
to magnetic pulses or laser light for 30 minutes using the setup shown in Figure 2 and Figure 
4 respectively. The test subject reported, without being told the content in the small container 
or details of the experiments, the brain effects felt for the whole period from the time of 
consumption to several hours after the exposure had stopped. 
 
In the third set of entanglement verification experiments, one-half of 400ml Poland 
Spring water with a shelve time of at least three months was immediately consumed by the 
test subject. After 30min from the time of consumption the other half was exposed to the 
magnetic pulses or laser light for 30min using the setup shown in Figure 2A and Figure 4A 
respectively. Test subject reported, without being told the content in the small container or 
details of the experiments, the brain effects felt for the whole period from the time of 
consumption to several hours after the exposure had stopped. 
 
In the fourth set of entanglement verification experiments, the test subject would take 
one-half of the 400ml fresh tap water exposed to microwave for 2min or magnetic pulses for 
30min to his/her workplace located more than 50 miles away (in one case to Beijing located 

 
24
more than 6,500 miles away) and consumed the same at the workplace at a specified time. 
After 30min from the time of consumption, the other half was exposed to magnetic pulses or 
laser light for 30min at the original location using the setup shown in Figure 2A and Figure 
4A respectively. The test subject reported the brain effects felt without being told the content 
in the small container or details of the experiments for the whole period from the time of 
consumption to several hours after the exposure had stopped. 
 
With respect to the test subjects, Subject A and C are respectively the first author and 
co-author of this paper and Subject B and C are respectively the father and mother of the first 
author. All four test subjects voluntarily consented to the proposed experiments. To ensure 
safety, all initial experiments were conducted on Subject A by himself. Further, all general 
anaesthetics used in the study were properly obtained for research purposes and all 
medications were either leftover items originally prescribed to Subject C’s late mother or 
items available over the counter. To achieve proper control, repeating experiments on 
Subject A were carried out by either Subject B or C in blind settings, that is, he was not told 
whether or what general anaesthetic or medication were applied before the end of the 
experiments. Further, all experiments on Subject B, C and D were also carried out in blind 
settings, that is, these test subjects were not told about the details of the experiments on them 
or whether or what general anaesthetic or medication were applied. 
 
 
3. RESULTS 
 
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained from the first two sets of experiments 
described above and Table 2 breakdowns the summary into each general anaesthetic studied 
plus morphine in the case of medications. In the control studies for the first set of 
experiments, all test subjects did not feel anything unusual from the exposure to magnetic 
pulses except vague or weak local sensation near the site of exposure. In contrast, all general 
anaesthetics studied produced clear and completely reproducible brain effects in various 
degrees and durations as if the test subjects had actually inhaled the same. These brain effects 
were first localized near the site of treatment and then spread over the whole brain and faded 
away within several hours. But residual brain effects (hangover) lingered on for more than 12 
hours in most cases. Among the general anaesthetics studied, chloroform and deuterated 
chloroform (chloroform D) produced the most pronounced and potent brain effects in 
strength and duration followed by isoflorance and diethyl ether. Tribromoethanol dissolved 
in water (1:50 by weight) and ethanol also produced noticeable effects but they are not 
summarized in the table. 
 
As also shown in Table 1, while the test subjects did not feel anything unusual from 
consuming the tab water treated in the control experiments with magnetic pulses or laser 
light, all the general anaesthetics studied produced clear and completely reproducible brain 
effects in various degrees and durations respectively similar to the observations in the first 
set of experiments. These effects were over the whole brain, intensified within the first half 
hour after the test subjects consumed the treated water and then faded away within the next a 

 
25
few hours. But residual brain effects lingered on for more than 12 hours as in the first set of 
experiments. Among the general anaesthetics studied, again chloroform and deuterated 
chloroform produced the most pronounced and potent effect in strength and duration 
followed by isoflorance and diethyl ether as illustrated in Figure 5A. Tribromoethanol 
dissolved in water (1:50 by weight) and ethanol also produced noticeable effects but they are 
not summarized in the table.

In addition, available results with flashlight and microwave as photon sources are 
also summarized in Table 1 respectively. In both cases general anaesthetics studied produced 
clear and reproducible brain effects. But the brain effects produced with microwave exposure 
were much stronger than those by flashlight. 
 
Table 1 also summarizes results obtained with several medications including 
morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, nicotine and caffeine in first and second sets of experiments. 
We found that they all produced clear and completely reproducible brain effects such as 
euphoria and/or hastened alertness in various degrees and durations respectively. For 
example, in the case of morphine in the first set of experiments the brain effect was first 
localized near the site of treatment and then spread over the whole brain and faded away 
within several hours. In the case of morphine in the second set of experiments the brain 
effect was over the whole brain, first intensified within the first half hour after the test 
subjects consumed the treated water and then faded away within the next a few hours as 
illustrated in Figure 6A.

Comparative experiments were also conducted on Subject A and C with chloroform 
and diethyl ether by asking them to inhale the vapours of chloroform and diethyl respectively 
for 5sec and compare the brain effect felt with those in the two sets of experiments described 
above. The brain effects induced in these comparative experiments were qualitatively similar 
to those produced in various experiments described above when chloroform and diethyl ether 
were respectively used for the exposure to photons of various sources. 
 
Furthermore, through additional experiments we also made the following preliminary 
observations. First, the brain effects in the first set of experiments could not be induced by a 
permanent magnet in the place of the magnetic coil. Nor could these effects be produced by a 
third magnetic coil placed directly above the head of the test subject and connected to a 
second magnetic coil through an amplifier with the second magnetic coil receiving magnetic 
pulses from a first magnetic coil after the said magnetic pulses first passed through the 
anaesthetic sample. That is, the brain effects could not be transmitted through an electric 
wire. Second, in the second set of experiments the water exposed to magnetic pulses, laser 
light, microwave and flashlight when a chemical substance was present tasted about the same 
as that before the exposure. Third, heating tap water exposed to magnetic pulses or laser light 
in the presence of a chemical substance diminished the brain effect of the said substance. 
Fourth, when distilled water was used instead of fresh tap water the observed brain effects 
were markedly reduced as illustrated in Figure 6 in the case of morphine. 
 
Table 3 summarizes the results obtained with the entanglement verification 
experiments carried out so far with chloroform, deuterated chloroform, diethyl ether and 
morphine. With all four sets of experiments, clear and consistently reproducible brain effects

More specifically, in the first set of entanglement verification experiments, the brain 
effects experienced by the test subjects were the same as those in which the setup shown in 
Figure 3A was used. In the second, third and fourth sets of these experiments, all test 
subjects did not feel anything unusual in the first half hour after consuming the first half of 
the water either exposed to microwave/magnetic pulses or just sit on the shelf for more than 
3 months. But within minutes after the second half of the same water was exposed to the 
laser light or magnetic pulses in the presence of general anaesthetics, the test subjects would 
experience clear and completely reproducible brain effect of various intensities as if they 
have actually inhaled the general anaesthetic used in the exposure of the second half of the 
water. The said brain effects were over the whole brain, first intensified within minutes after 
the exposure began and persisted for the duration of the said exposure and for the next 
several hours after the exposure had stopped. Further, all other conditions being the same, 
magnetic coil produced more intense brain effects than the red laser. Furthermore, all other 
conditions being the same, the water exposed to microwave or magnetic pulses before 
consumption produced more intense brain effects than water just sitting on the shelve for 
more than 3 months before consumption.

3. DISCUSSIONS & CONCLUSIONS 
 
With respect to the second, third and fourth sets of entanglement verification 
experiments, the only possible explanation for the brain effects experienced by the test 
subjects are that they were the consequences of quantum entanglement because the water 
consumed by the test subjects was never directly exposed to the magnetic pulses or the laser 
lights in the presence of the chemical substances. 
 
There are other indications that quantum entanglement was the cause of the brain 
effects experienced by the test subjects. First, the brain effect inducing mean could not be 
transmitted through an electrical wire as already reported above. Second, the said inducing 
mean did not depend on the wavelengths of the photons generated. Thus, mere interactions 
among the photons, a chemical substance and water will induce brain effects after a test 
subject consumes the water so interacted. While designing and conducting the herein 
described experiments, the first author became aware of the claims related to the so called 
“water memory” (7). However, since these claims were said to be non-reproducible, we do 
not wish to discuss them further here except to say that we currently do not subscribe to any 
of the existing views on the subject and readers are encouraged to read our recent online 
paper on quantum entanglement (8). 
 
In light of the results from the entanglement verification experiments, we conclude 
that the brain effects experienced by the test subjects were the consequences of quantum 
entanglement between quantum entities inside the brains and those of the chemical 
substances under study induced by the entangling photons of the magnetic pulses or applied 
lights. More specifically, the results obtained in the first set of experiments can be interpreted 
as the consequence of quantum entanglement between the quantum entities in the brain and 
those in the chemical substances induced by the photons of the magnetic pulses. Similarly, 
the results obtained from the second sets of experiments can be explained as quantum 
entanglement between the quantum entities in the chemical substance and those in the water 
induced by the photons of the magnetic pulses, laser light, microwave or flashlight and the 
subsequent physical transport of the water entangled with the said chemical substance to the 
brain after consumption by the test subject which, in turn, produced the observed brain 
effects through the entanglement of the quantum entities inside the brain with those in the 
consumed water. 
 
We would like to point out that although the indicators used to measure the brain 
effects were qualitative and subjective, they reflect the first-person experiences of the 
qualities, intensities and durations of these effects by the test subjects since their brains were 
directly used as experimental probes. Further, these effects are completely reproducible 
under blind experimental settings so that possible placebo effects were excluded. However, 
as with many other important new results, replications by others are the key to independently 
confirm our results reported here. Our experiments may appear simple and even “primitive” 
but the results and implications are profound. 
 

 
31
We first chose general anaesthetics in our experiments because they are among the 
most powerful brain-influencing substances. Our expectation was that, if nuclear and/or 
electronic spins inside the brain are involved in brain functions such as perception as recently 
hypothesized by us2, the brain may be able to sense the effect of an external anaesthetic 
sample through quantum entanglement between these spins inside the brain and those of the 
said anaesthetic sample induced by the photons of the magnetic pulses by first interacting 
with the nuclear and/or electronic spins inside the said anaesthetic sample, thus carrying 
quantum information about the anaesthetic molecules, and then interacting with the nuclear 
and/or electronic spins inside the brain. 
 
We suggest here that the said quantum entities inside the brains are likely nuclear 
and/or electronic spins for the reasons discussed below. Neural membranes and proteins 
contain vast numbers of nuclear spins such as 1H, 13C, 31P and 15N. These nuclear spins and 
unpaired electronic spins are the natural targets of interaction with the photons of the 
magnetic pulses or other sources. These spins form complex intra- and inter-molecular 
networks through various intra-molecular J- and dipolar couplings and both short- and long-
range intermolecular dipolar couplings. Further, nuclear spins have relatively long relaxation 
times after excitations (9). Thus, when a nematic liquid crystal is irradiated with multi-
frequency pulse magnetic fields, its 1H spins can form long-lived intra-molecular quantum 
coherence with entanglement for information storage (10). Long-lived (~ .05 ms) 
entanglement of two macroscopic electron spin ensembles in room temperature has also been 
achieved (3). Furthermore, spin is a fundamental quantum process with intrinsic connection 
to the structure of space-time (11) and was shown to be responsible for the quantum effects 
in both Hestenes and Bohmian quantum mechanics (12, 13). Thus, we have recently 
suggested that these spins could be involved in brain functions at a more fundamental level 
(2). 
 
Several important conclusions and implications can be drawn from our findings. 
First, biologically/chemically meaningful information can be transmitted through quantum 
entanglement from one place to another by photons and possibly other quantum objects such 
as electrons, atoms and even molecules. Second, both classical and quantum information can 
be transmitted between locations of arbitrary distances through quantum entanglement alone. 
Third, instantaneous signalling is physically real which implies that Einstein's theory of 
relativity is in real (not just superficial) conflict with quantum theory. Fourth, brain processes 
such as perception and other biological processes likely involve quantum information and 
nuclear and/or electronic spins may play important roles in these processes. Further, our 
findings provide important new insights into the essence and implications of the mysterious 
quantum entanglement and clues for solving the long-standing measurement problem in 
quantum theory including the roles of the observer and/or consciousness. Very importantly, 
our findings also provide a unified scientific framework for explaining many paranormal 
and/or anomalous effects such as telepathy, telekinesis and homeopathy, if they do indeed 
exist, thus transforming these paranormal and/or anomalous effects into the domains of 
conventional sciences. With respect applications, our findings enable various quantum 
entanglement technologies be developed. Some of these technologies can be used to deliver 

 
32
the therapeutic effects of many drugs to various biological systems such as human bodies 
without physically administrating the same to the said systems. This will dramatically reduce 
waste and increase productivity because the same drugs can be repeatedly used to deliver 
their therapeutic effects to the mass on site or from remote locations of arbitrary distances. 
Further, many substances of nutritional and recreational values can be repeatedly 
administrated to desired biological systems such as human bodies through the said 
technologies either on site or from remote locations. Other such technologies can be used for 
instantaneous communications between remote locations of arbitrary distances in various 
ways. Potentially, these technologies can also be used to entangle two or more human minds 
for legitimate and beneficial purposes.

Part III. 
Evidence of Non-local Chemical, Thermal and   
 
 
Gravitational Effects 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Scientific methods require that one conform one’s knowledge of nature to repeatable 
observations. Thus, it is unscientific to reject what’s observed repeatedly and consistently. 
With this in mind, we comment that quantum entanglement has been recently shown to be 
physically real in many laboratories (1, 2). Indeed, quantum entanglement is ubiquitous in 
the microscopic world and manifests itself macroscopically under some circumstances (1, 2). 
But common belief is that it alone cannot be used to transmit information3 nor could it be 
used to produce macroscopic non-local effects. Yet we have recently found evidence of non-
local effects of chemical substances on the brain produced through it (4, 5). Indeed, spins of 
electrons, photons and nuclei have now been successfully entangled in various ways for the 
purposes of quantum computation and communication (6, 7). While our reported results are 
under independent verifications by other groups, we report here our experimental findings of 
non-local chemical, thermal and gravitational effects in simple physical systems such as 
reservoirs of water quantum-entangled with water being manipulated in a remote reservoir 
(4). With the aids of high-precision instruments, we have found that the pH value, 
temperature and gravity of water in the detecting reservoirs can be non-locally affected 
through manipulating water in the remote reservoir. In particular, the pH value changes in the 
same direction as that being manipulated; the temperature can change against that of local 
environment; and the gravity can change against local gravity. These non-local effects are all 
reproducible and can be used for non-local signaling and many other purposes. We suggest 
that they are mediated by quantum entanglement between nuclear and/or electron spins in 
treated water and discuss the profound implications of these results. 
 
Our motivation for measuring pH change of water in one reservoir, while 
manipulating water in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former, is to 
investigate whether and how pH value in the water being measured shifts under non-local 
influences. Our motivation for measuring temperature variation of water in one reservoir, 
while manipulating water in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former, is to 
investigate whether and how the thermodynamics of water being measured changes under 
non-local influences. Our motivation for measuring gravity change of one reservoir of water, 
while manipulating water in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former, is to 
investigate whether gravity is a non-local effect associated with quantum entanglement. 
 
The successes of the experiments described herein were achieved with the aids of 
high-precision analytical instruments. They include an Ohaus Voyager Analytical Balance 
with capacity 210g, resolution 0.1mg, repeatability 0.1mg and sensitivity drift 3 PPM/ºC, a 
Control Company traceable-calibration digital thermometer with resolution 0.001ºC and 
repeatability 0.002ºC near 25ºC in liquid such as water (estimated from calibration data 

 
34
provided), and a Hanna microprocessor pH meter Model 213 with resolution 0.001 and 
repeatability 0.002. The other key apparatus is a 25-litre Dewar filled with liquid nitrogen 
and positioned remotely at a desired distance which not only provided the drastic changes in 
the water being manipulated but also served as a natural Faraday cage blocking any possible 
electromagnetic influence between the water being measured and the water being 
manipulated. Also vital to the success of the experiments described herein was the stable 
environment found in an underground room which shields many external noises such as 
mechanical vibration, air turbulence and large temperature change.  
 
 
2. MATERIALS & METHODS 
 
Quantum-entangled stock water in individual volumes of 500ml or similar quantities 
was prepared as described previously (4) which might then be split into smaller volumes or 
combined into larger ones based on needs. Briefly, in one procedure 500ml fresh tap water in 
a closed plastic reservoir was exposed to microwave radiation in a 1500W microwave oven 
for 2min and then left in room temperature for 24 hours before use. In a second procedure 
500ml fresh tap water in the closed plastic reservoir was exposed to audio-frequency 
radiations of a 20W magnetic coil for 30min and then left in room temperature for 24 hours 
before use. In a third procedure, 500ml bottled natural water was simply left in room 
temperature for at least 30 days before use. In a fourth procedure, 500ml bottled distilled 
water was simply left in room temperature for at least 30 days before use. It was found 
previously that the stock water prepared according to these procedures is quantum-entangled 
(4). 
 
Figure 1 shows a diagram of the key experimental setup. It includes (a) the analytical 
balance calibrated internally and stabilized in the underground room for more than one week 
before use and a tightly closed plastic first-reservoir containing 175ml water split from the 
500ml stock water which is placed on the wind-shielded pan of the balance with 1-inch white 
foam in between as insulation; (b) the digital thermometer and calibrated pH meter placed 
into the middle of a glass second-reservoir containing 75ml water split from the 500ml stock 
water which is closed to prevent air exchange; and (c) the 25-litre Dewar containing 15-25 
litres of liquid nitrogen which is located at a distant of 50 feet from the underground room 
and a tightly closed plastic third-reservoir containing 250ml water split from the 500ml stock 
water to be submerged into the liquid nitrogen in the Dewar at a specified time. 
 
Experiments with the above first-setup were carried out as follows: (a) prepare the 
500ml quantum-entangled stock water, divide the same into 175ml, 75ml and 250ml portions 
and put them into their respective reservoirs described above; (b) set up the experiment 
according to Figure 1 and let the instruments to stabilize for 30min before any measurements 
is taken; (c) record for 20min minute-by-minute changes of pH value and temperature of the 
water in the first-reservoir and weight of the second-reservoir with water before submerging 
the third reservoir into liquid nitrogen; (d) submerge the third-reservoir with water into liquid 
nitrogen for 15min or another desired length of time and record the instrument readings as 

 
35
before; and (e) take the third-reservoir out of liquid nitrogen, thaw the same in warm water 
for 30min or longer and, at the same time, record the instrument readings as before. Control 
experiments were carried out in same steps with nothing done to the water in the third-
reservoir. 
 
In one variation of the above setup, the closed plastic third-reservoir was replaced 
with a metal container and instead of freeze-thaw treatment the water in the metal container 
was quickly heated to boiling within 4-5 minutes and then cooled in cold water. In a second 
variation of the above setup, the gravity portion of the experiment was eliminated and the 
water in the first and second reservoirs was combined into a closed thermal flask which 
prevents heat exchange between the water being measured and its local environment. In a 
third variation of the above setup, the gravity portion of the experiment was eliminated and 
the water in the first and second reservoirs was combined into a fourth plastic container in 
which 5ml concentrated HCl (30% by weight) was first added, then 20g NaOH powder was 
added and next the same water was transferred to a metal container and heated to boiling on a 
stove. In a fourth variation of the above first-setup, the 25-litre Dewar containing liquid 
nitrogen was replaced by a large water tank located 20-feet above the underground room 
which contained 200-gallon tap water sitting in room temperature for months and, instead of 
submersion, the water in the third-reservoir was poured into the large water tank the purpose 
of which was to quantum-entangle the poured water with the water in the large tank. In a 
fifth variation of the above setup, the gravity portion of the experiment was eliminated and 
the water in the first and second reservoirs was combined into a closed glass fourth-reservoir 
which was moved to a location more than 50 miles away from the Dewar for temperature 
measurement. 
 
Figure 2 shows a diagram of the second experimental setup. It includes: (a) a red laser 
with a 50mW output and wavelengths 635nm – 675nm placed next and pointed to a flat glass 
first-reservoir containing 200ml tap water sitting in room temperature for more than a week 
without air exchange; (b) the calibrated pH meter and optionally the digital thermometer 
placed into the middle of the said flat glass reservoir which was closed to prevent air 
exchange; and (3) a round glass second-reservoir containing 100ml concentrated HCl (30% 
by weight) to be placed 500cm away from the first-reservoir at a specified time. 
 
Experiments with the above second setup were carried out as follows: (a) prepare the 
200ml tap water and set up the experiment according Figure 2; turn on the laser so that the 
laser light first passes through the first-reservoir and then gets scattered on a nearby concrete 
wall, and let the instruments to stabilize for 30min before any measurement is taken; (b) 
record for 10min. minute-by-minute changes of pH value and optionally temperature of the 
water in the first-reservoir; and (c) place the second reservoir containing 100ml HCl on the 
path of the laser light and at a distance of 500cm from the first reservoir and record for 
60min or longer instrument readings as before. Control experiments were carried out in same 
steps in the absence of HCl.

3. RESULTS 
 
Figures 3, 4 and 5 summarize the results obtained from experiments conducted with 
the key setup and one batch of quantum-entangled water which were simply bottled natural 
water with a shelf time of more than 90 days. Similar results were also obtained with water 
prepared according to other quantum entanglement methods mentioned above and other 
quantum-entangled liquid such as olive oil, alcohol and even Coke Cola as discussed later. 
The different distances of the Dewar from the underground room where most measurements 
were done made no noticeable differences with respect to the results obtained. 
 
Figure 3 shows changes of pH value of the water in the second-reservoir during the 
three stages of manipulations of the water in the remote third-reservoir. As shown, within 
minutes after the remote third-reservoir was submerged into liquid nitrogen, during which 
the temperature of water being manipulated would drop from about 25ºC to -193 ºC, the pH 
value of the water in the second reservoir steadily stopped dropping and then started rising, 
but about 20 minutes after the frozen water was taken out of liquid nitrogen and thawed in 
warm water the pH value of the same steadily leveled off and started dropping again. In 
contrast, the control experiments did not show such dynamics. It is known that the pH value 
of water increases as its temperature goes down to 0ºC. Therefore, the pH value of water 
being measured goes in the same direction as the remote water when the latter is 
manipulated. The difference in pH values from control in which no freeze-thaw was done at 
the point of thawing is about 0.010. However, if the water being measured is kept in a 
thermal flask to prevent heat exchange with the local environment, no effect on pH value was 
observed under freeze-thaw treatment of the remote water. Statistical analysis performed on 
data collected after freezing for 10 minutes show that the results are significantly different 
under these different treatments/settings. 
Figure 4 shows temperature variations of the water in the second-reservoir during the 
three stages of manipulations of the water in the remote third-reservoir. As shown, before the 
submersion of the remote third-reservoir into liquid nitrogen the temperature of the water in 
the second-reservoir rose in small increments due to, by design, the slight temperature 
difference between the local environment and the water inside the second reservoir; but 
within about 4-5 minutes after the remote third-reservoir was submerged into liquid nitrogen, 
during which the temperature of water being manipulated would drop from about 25ºC to -
193 ºC, the temperature of the water in the second reservoir first stopped rising and then 
steadily dropped in small increments; and then within about 4-5 minutes after the frozen 
water was taken out of liquid nitrogen and thawed in warm water the temperature of the same 
first stopped dropping and then steadily rose again in small increments. In contrast, the 
control experiments did not show such dynamics. The temperature difference from control in 
which no freeze-thaw was done at the point of thawing is about 0.05oC. However, if the 
water being measured is kept in a thermal flask to prevent heat exchange with the local 
environment, no dropping of temperature were observed under freeze-thaw treatment of the 
remote water. Statistical analysis performed on data collected after freezing for 10 minutes 
show that the results are significantly different under these different treatments/settings. 
 

 
37
In addition, Figure 4A shows one particular example of temperature variations under 
remote manipulation of water quantum-entangled with water being measured. In this case, 
the temperature difference from control at the point of thawing is about 0.08oC. Further, 
Figure 4B shows one example of temperature variation of a different liquid, Coke Cola, 
under remote manipulation of a portion of the said liquid quantum-entangled with another 
portion being measured. Other liquids such as distilled water, olive oil and alcohol also 
showed similar qualitative results under the same freeze-thaw treatment. Furthermore, 
preliminary experiments conducted with the temperature measurement done at a location 
more than 50 miles way from the Dewar also show results similar to those obtained at 
distances of 50 and 500 feet respectively. 
 
Figure 5 shows weight variations of the first-reservation during the three stages of 
manipulation of the water in the remote third-reservoir. Before the submersion of the remote 
third-reservoir into liquid nitrogen the weight being measured drifted lower very slowly. But 
almost immediately after the remote third-reservoir was submerged into liquid nitrogen, 
during which the temperature and physical properties of water being manipulated drastically 
changed, the weight of the first-reservoir dropped at an increased rate, and after the frozen 
water was taken out the liquid nitrogen and thawed in warm water the weight of the same 
first stopped dropping and, in some cases, even rose before resuming drifting lower as further 
discussed below. In contrast, the control experiments did not show such dynamics. The 
weight difference from control in which no freeze-thaw was done at the point of thawing is 
about 2.5mg. Statistical analysis performed on data collected after freezing for 10 minutes 
show that the results are significantly different under these different treatments/settings. 
 
As shown in Figure 5A, in some cases, the weight of the water being measured not 
only stopped dropping for several minutes but also rose. The signatures of freezing induced 
weight decreases and thawing induced weight increases for three different thawing times are 
very clear. In addition, Figure 5B shows one example of weight and temperature variations 
under the same remote manipulation of water quantum-entangled with water being weighed 
and measured respectively. Again, the signatures of freezing and thawing induced weight and 
temperature decreases and increases are respectively very clear. Further, Figure 5C shows 
another example of weight and temperature variations under another same remote 
manipulation in which the Dewar was located about 500 feet away from where the 
measurements were taken. The general background trend of decreasing temperature was due 
to environmental temperature change. Yet again, the signatures of freezing and thawing 
induced weight and temperature variations were respectively are very clear. Also, when the 
remote water was quickly heated to boiling on a stove instead of being frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, a brief rise of weight in the range of about 0.5mg were repeated observed in several 
experiments conducted so far. 
 
Furthermore, when the remote water was poured into the 200-gallon water tank 
instead of being frozen in liquid nitrogen, small but noticeably increased weight losses were 
repeatedly observed in the several experiments conducted to date. More specifically, before 
mixing of the water in the remote third-reservoir with water in the water tank the measured 

 
38
weight drifted lower very slowly, but within short time measured in minutes after the water 
in the remote third-reservoir was poured into the water tank, during which the water in the 
said tank got quantum-entangled with the water in the third-reservoir, the weight of the first-
reservoir dropped at small but increased rate for a period of time. In contrast, the control 
experiments did not show such dynamics. 
 
Figure 6 shows an example of temperature variations under the respective treatments 
of adding 5ml concentrated HCl (30%) to the third reservoir, then adding 20g NaOH to the 
same and third heating the same to boiling point. The signatures of these remote treatments 
induced temperature changes were clear and repeatedly observable in quite a few 
experiments conducted to date. 
 
Figure 7 shows the variations of pH value of the water in the first reservoir in 
experiments done with the setup in Figure 2. As shown, in about 30 minutes after the second-
reservoir containing 100ml concentrated HCl (30% by weight) was placed behind the first-
reservoir at a distance of 500cm and on the path of the laser beam, during which the water in 
the first-reservoir got quantum-entangled with the content in the second reservoir, the pH 
value of the water in the first-reservoir steadily decreased. In contrast, the control 
experiments did not show such dynamics. Also, the 50mW red laser did not affect the 
temperature of the water in the first reservoir significantly during the whole treatment. The 
difference in pH value from control in which HCl was absence is about 0.070 after 50 
minutes of exposure to HCl. Statistical analysis performed on data collected after exposure to 
HCl for 30 minutes show that the results are significantly different from control. Various 
experiments done with direct additions of HCl to the remote water also repeated showed 
decreases in pH value in the water being measured. 
 
 
3. DISCUSSIONS & CONCLUSIONS 
 
With all experimental setups and their variations described herein, we have observed 
clear and reproducible non-local effects with the aids of high-precision analytical instruments 
and under well-controlled conditions. The physical observables used for measuring the non-
local effects are simple ones which can be measured with high precisions. These effects are, 
even under the most stringent statistical analysis, significantly above and beyond what were 
noticeable in the control experiments. 
 
Through careful analysis, we have excluded the possibility that the observed weight 
variation was a secondary local effect due to heat loss and/or sensitivity drift of balance 
associated with temperature change induced by the remote manipulation. First, during the 
period of remote manipulation the total temperature change was less than 0.08ºC so the total 
heat loss for the 175ml water in the first-reservoir is about 60J. In contrast, the weight loss 
during remote manipulation was on average about 2mg which is 18x109J in energy unit. 
Second, the first-reservoir and the pan of the balance were separated by 1-inch white foam to 
prevent heat transfer to the analytic balance. Even in the highly unlikely scenario that this 

 
39
temperature change somehow affected the overall temperature of the balance, the associated 
sensitivity drift of the balance was about 0.03mg which is 10 times smaller than what’s 
actually observed. In addition, Figures 5A, 5B and 5C also show several other signatures of 
remote freeze-thaw treatment as the sole cause of the observed weight variations. Therefore, 
the observed gravity variation is a genuine and direct non-local effect associated with 
quantum entanglement. However, as with many other important new results, replications by 
others are the key to independently confirm our results reported here. 
 
We chose to use liquid nitrogen in a large Dewar placed at a distant location for 
manipulating water in our experiments because it can provide drastic changes in temperature 
and properties of water in a very short period of time. Our expectation was that, if the 
quantum entities inside the water being measured are able to sense the changes experienced 
by the quantum entities in the water being manipulated through quantum entanglement and 
further utilize the information associated with the said changes, the chemical, thermal and 
gravitational properties of the water might be affected through quantum entanglement 
mediated non-local processes (4, 5). The most logical explanation for these observed non-
local effects is that they are the consequences of non-local processes mediated by quantum 
entanglement between quantum entities in the water being measured and the remote water 
being manipulated as more specifically illustrated below. 
 
First, when pH value of the water in the manipulation reservoir is high or low or is 
changing under direct manipulation such as extreme cooling or heating or addition of acidic 
or alkaline chemical, the measured pH in the detecting reservoir shifts in the same direction 
under the non-local influence of the water in the manipulation reservoir mediated through 
quantum entanglement and, under the condition that the detecting reserve is able to exchange 
energy with its local environment, as if H+ in the latter is directly available to water in the 
detecting reservoir. 
 
Second, when the temperature in the manipulation reservoir is extremely low or high 
or is changing under direct manipulation such as extreme cooling or heating or addition of 
heat-generating and/or property-changing chemical such as concentrated HCl or NaOH 
powder, the temperature in the detecting reservoir changes in the same direction under non-
local influence of the water in the manipulation reservoir mediated through quantum 
entanglement and, under the condition that the detecting reserve is able to exchange heat 
with its local environment so that the local thermodynamic energy is conserved, as if the heat 
or lack of it in manipulation reservoir is directly available to the water in the detecting 
reservoir. 
 
Third, when water in manipulation reservoir is manipulated though extreme cooling, 
heating or mixing with large quantum-entangled mass, e.g., water, such that the quantum 
entanglement of the water under manipulation with its local environment changes, the weight 
of the water in the detecting reservoir also changes under the non-local influence of the 
manipulation reservoir mediated through quantum entanglement so that, it is hereby 
predicted, that the global gravitational energy/potential is conserved.

We suggest here that the said quantum entities inside water are likely nuclear spins 
for the reasons discussed below. Water contains vast numbers of nuclear spins carried by 1H. 
These spins form complex intra- and inter-molecular networks through various intra-
molecular J- and dipolar couplings and both short- and long-range intermolecular dipolar 
couplings. Further, nuclear spins have relatively long relaxation times after excitations (8). 
Thus, when a nematic liquid crystal is irradiated with multi-frequency pulse magnetic fields, 
its 1H spins can form long-lived intra-molecular quantum coherence with entanglement for 
information storage (9). Long-lived (~ .05 ms) entanglement of two macroscopic electron 
spin ensembles in room temperature has also been achieved1. Furthermore, spin is a 
fundamental quantum process and was shown to be responsible for the quantum effects in 
both Hestenes and Bohmian quantum mechanics (10, 11). Thus, we suggest that quantum-
entangled nuclear spins and/or electron spins are likely the mediators of all observed non-
local effects reported here (4). 
 
Several important conclusions and implications can be drawn from our findings. 
First, we have realized non-local signaling using three different physical observables, pH 
value, temperature and gravity. Second, we have shown that the temperature of water in a 
detecting reservoir quantum-entangled with water in a remote reservoir can change against 
the temperature of its local environment when the latter is manipulated under the condition 
that the water the detecting reservoir is able to exchange heat with its local environment. 
Third, we have also shown that the gravity of water in a detecting reservoir quantum-
entangled with water in a remote reservoir can change against the gravity of its local 
environment when the latter was remotely manipulated. Our findings imply that the 
properties of all matters can be affected non-locally through quantum entanglement mediated 
processes. Second, the second law of thermodynamics may not hold when two quantum-
entangled systems together with their respective local environments are considered as two 
isolated systems and one of them is manipulated. Third, gravity has a non-local aspect 
associated with quantum entanglement thus can be non-locally manipulated through quantum 
entanglement mediated processes. Fourth, in quantum-entangled systems such as biological 
systems, quantum information may drive such systems to a more ordered state against the 
disorderly effect of environmental heat. 
 
On a more fundamental level, our findings shed new lights on the nature and 
characteristics of quantum entanglement and gravity, challenge the applicability of Einstein’s 
relativity theories in the quantum domain, provide vital clues for resolution of the 
measurement problem in quantum mechanics, and support non-local hidden variable based 
theories such as Bohmian mechanics and a non-local cosmology. 
Finally, with respect applications, our findings enable various quantum entanglement 
assisted technologies be developed. Some of these technologies can be used to manipulate 
and/or affect remotely various physical, chemical and/or biological systems including human 
bodies. Other such technologies can be used for non-local signalling and communications 
between remote locations of arbitrary distances in various ways. Potentially, some of these 

 
41
technologies can also be used to engineer the gravitational properties of physical matters and 
develop new types of space vehicles. 
 
Figure1: Illustration of the key experimental setup. Several variations of this setup 
were also used in the actual experiments as described in the text. For example, in 
one variation, the manipulation was heating the water in the 3rd reservoir to boiling 
point and then cooling it down. In a second variation, the gravity measurement was 
eliminated and the manipulations were first adding 5ml concentrated HCl (30%) to 
the third reservoir, then adding 20g NaOH to the same and third heating the same to 
boiling point. In a third variation, the Dewar was located more than 500 feet away 
from the site of measurement. In fourth variation, the gravity and pH measurements 
were eliminated and the temperature measurements were carried out more than 50 
miles away from the location of the Dewar.

Figure2: Illustration of the second experimental setup which allows the measurement 
of pH value in the presence or absence of concentrated HCl about 500cm away from 
and behind the water being measured. If no quantum entanglement is involved, the 
presence or absence of the HCl should not affect the pH value.

Figure5: Weight variations under remote manipulations of water quantum-entangled 
with water being weighed. The weight at the starting point is set to zero and the 
results shown were obtained from one batch of quantum-entangled water. The 
weight differences from control in which no freeze-thaw was done at the point of 
thawing is about 2.5mg. In some cases, the weight of the water being weighed not 
only briefly stop dropping for several minutes but also rose briefly for several 
seconds to minutes as shown in Figure5A. Also when the remote water was quickly 
heated to boiling on a stove instead of being frozen in liquid nitrogen, a brief rise of 
weight in the range of about 0.5mg were repeated observed in one variation of the 
key setup. Further, when the remote water was poured into a 200-gallon water tank, 
small but noticeably increased weight losses were also observed in several 
experiments conducted to date. Statistical analysis performed on data collected after 
freezing for 10 minutes show that the results are significantly different under the 
different treatments/settings shown.

Figure5A: Examples of weight variations under remote manipulations of water 
quantum-entangled with water being weighed. The onset of increased weight loss 
started either at the time of freezing treatment or slightly later. The signatures of 
thawing induced weight increases were clear for the three different thawing times. 
The distances shown are the respectively distances of the Dewar to the location of 
measurement in each experiment.

Figure5B: One example of weight and temperature variations under the same 
remote manipulation of water quantum-entangled with water being weighed and 
measured respectively. The onset of increased weight loss started at the time of 
freezing treatment but the onset of temperature decrease against environmental 
temperature started a few minutes later after freezing treatment started. The 
signatures of thawing induced weight and temperature increases were clear. The 
distance shown is the distance of the Dewar to the location of measurement. 

 
49
 
Figure5C: Second example of weight and temperature variations under another 
same remote manipulation of water quantum-entangled with water being weighed 
and measured respectively. The general background trend of decreasing 
temperature was due to environmental temperature change. The onset of increased 
weight loss started at the time of freezing treatment but the onset of increased 
temperature loss started a few minutes later after freezing treatment started. The 
signatures of thawing at time=45min induced weight increase and slow down of 
temperature loss were again clear. The distance shown is the distance of the Dewar 
to the location of measurement.

Many experiments have shown that quantum entanglement is physically real. In this 
paper, we will discuss its ontological origin, implications and applications by thinking 
outside the standard interpretations of quantum mechanics. We argue that quantum 
entanglement originates from the primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal 
pre-spacetime, implies genuine interconnectedness and inseparableness of once interacting 
quantum entities, plays vital roles in biology and consciousness and, once better understood 
and harnessed, has far-reaching consequences and applications in many fields such as 
medicine and neuroscience. We further argue that quantum computation power also 
originates from the primordial spin processes in pre-spacetime. Finally, we discuss the roles 
of quantum entanglement in spin-mediated consciousness theory.

Introduction 
 
Quantum entanglement is ubiquitous, appears everywhere in the microscopic 
world (See, e.g., Durt, 2004; Brooks, 2005) and under some circumstances manifests 
itself macroscopically (Arnesen, et al, 2001; Ghost et al, 2003 & Julsgaard et al, 
2001). Indeed, it is currently the most intensely studied subject in physics. Further, 
speculations abound as to its nature and implications (See, e.g., Clarke, 2004, 
Josephson, 1991 & Radin, 2004). There are many general and technical papers 
written on the subject. So cutting to the chase, we shall immediately outline our 
propositions on the subject and then discuss each in some detail with references to 
existing literature whenever possible. Readers are advised that our propositions are 
outside the mainstream physics and other authors may hold similar views on some of 
the points we shall make in this paper. We will also discuss the roles of quantum 
entanglement in spin-mediated consciousness theory (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2003, 2004a-
d).

The following are our propositions about the ontological origin, implications 
and applications of quantum entanglement besides quantum computation: 
1) It originates from the primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-
temporal pre-spacetime. It is the quantum “glue” holding once interacting 
quantum 
entities 
together 
in 
pre-spacetime, 
implies 
genuine 
interconnectedness and inseparableness of the said quantum entities and can 
be directly sensed and utilized by the entangled quantum entities. 
2) Thus, it can influence chemical/biochemical reactions, other physical 
processes and micro- and macroscopic properties of all forms of matters, thus, 
playing vital roles in many biological processes and consciousness. It is the 
genuine cause of many anomalous effects (if they do exist) in parapsychology, 
alternative medicine and other fields as some authors have already suspected 
in some cases. 
3) Further, it can be harnessed, tamed and developed into revolutionary 
technologies to serve the mankind in many areas such as health, medicine and 
even recreation besides the already emerging fields of quantum computation. 
2. 
The Origin and Nature of Quantum Entanglement 
 
Popular opinion has it that Erwin Shrödinger coined the word “entanglement” 
and first used it in 1935 in his article published in the Proceedings of Cambridge 
Philosophical Society (Shrödinger, 1935). Mathematically, Shrödinger showed that 
entanglement arises from the interactions of two particles through the evolution of 
Shrödinger equation and called this phenomenon the characteristic trait of quantum 
theory (id.). Einstein called quantum entanglement “spooky action at a distance” in 
the famous EPR debate (See, e.g., Einstein et al, 1935). 
 
Ontologically, we argue that quantum entanglement arises from the primordial 
self-referential spin processes which we had argued previously are the driving force 
behind quantum effects, spacetime dynamics and consciousness (Hu & Wu, 2003; 
2004a). Pictorially, two interacting quantum entities such as two electrons get 
entangled with each other through the said spin processes by exchanging one or more 
entangling photons with entangling occurring in pre-spacetime. Such ontological 
interpretation is supported by existing literature as discussed below. 
 
 
First, Hestenes showed that in the geometric picture for the Dirac electron the 
zitterbewegung associated with the spin is responsible for all known quantum effects 
of said electron and the imagery number i in the Dirac equation is said to be due to 
electronic spin (See, e.g., Hestines, 1983). 
 
 
Second, in Bohmian mechanics the “quantum potential” is responsible for 
quantum effects (Bohm and Hiley, 1993). Salesi and Recami (1998) have recently 
shown that said potential is a pure consequence of “internal motion” associated with 

 
58
spin evidencing that the quantum behavior is a direct consequence of the fundamental 
existence of spin. Esposito (1999) has expanded this result by showing that “internal 
motion” is due to the spin of the particle, whatever its value. Bogan (2002) has 
further expanded these results by deriving a spin-dependent gauge transformation 
between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics and the time-dependent 
Shrödinger equation of quantum mechanics which is a function of the quantum 
potential of Bohmian mechanics. 
 
 
Third, spin is a unique quantum concept often being said to have no classical 
counterpart (See Tomonaga, 1997) and associated with the “internal motion” of a 
point particle. Unlike mass and charge that enter a dynamic equation as arbitrary 
parameters, spin reveals itself through the structure of the relativistic quantum 
equation for fermions that combines quantum mechanics with special relativity 
(Dirac, 1928). Indeed, many models of elementary particles and even space-time 
itself are built with spinors (Budinich, 2001; Penrose, 1960 & 1967). Pauli (1927) and 
Dirac (1928) were the first to use spinors to describe the electron. Also, Kiehn (1999) 
showed that the absolute square of the wave function could be interpreted as vorticity 
distribution of a viscous compressible fluid that also indicates that spin is the process 
driving quantum mechanics. 
 
 
Therefore, in view of the foregoing it could be said that the driving force 
behind the evolution of Shrödinger equation is quantum spin and, since quantum 
entanglement arises from the evolution of Shrödinger equation the said spin is the 
genuine cause of quantum entanglement. 
 
 
What do we mean by pre-spacetime? Pre-spacetime in this article means a 
non-spatial and non-temporal domain but it is not associated with an extra-dimension 
in the usual sense since there is no distance or time in such domain (See, e.g., Hu & 
Wu, 2002). We have argued before that in a dualistic approach mind resides in this 
domain and unpaired nuclear and/or electronic spins are its pixels in the reductionist 
perspective (id.). So pre-spacetime is a holistic domain located outside spacetime but 
connected through quantum thread/channel to everywhere in spacetime enabling 
quantum entanglement or Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance.” It has similarity to 
Bohm’s concept of implicate order (Bohm & Hiley, 1993). Aerts (2004), Clarke 
(2004) and others have also expressed the non-space view of quantum nonlocality. 
 
 
Such a non-spatial and non-temporal pre-spacetime is a “world” beyond 
Einstein’s relativistic world but does not contradict with the latter since the latter 
deals with classical physical events occurring within spacetime. In contrast, quantum 
entanglement occurs within non-spatial and non-temporal domain. Therefore, 
instantaneous signaling through quantum entanglement in pre-spacetime is possible if 
the entangled quantum entities can directly sense and/or utilize the entanglement. 
 

 
59
 
So what is then the essence of quantum entanglement? We propose that 
quantum entanglement is not merely the correlations of certain observable physical 
parameters in the process of measurement but genuine interconnectedness and 
inseparableness of once interacting quantum entities. It is the quantum “glue” holding 
once interacting quantum entities together in pre-spacetime and can be directly 
sensed and utilized by the entangled quantum entities as further discussed below. It 
can be diluted through entanglement with the environment, i.e., decoherence. 
 
3. 
Implications of Quantum Entanglement 
 
It is often said that instantaneous signaling through quantum entanglement is 
impossible because of Eberhard’s theorem that basically says that since local 
measurements always produce random results no information can be sent through 
quantum entanglement alone (Eberhard, 1978). However, there are at least two ways 
to circumvent this impossibility. The first is to assume that the statistical distribution 
can be modified and utilized to transmit information. Quite a few authors have 
expressed this view (Josephson, 1991; Stapp, 1982 & Walker, 1974) especially when 
discussing the roles of consciousness in parapsychology such as telepathy. The 
second is to assume that each quantum entity can directly sense and utilize quantum 
entanglement as already mentioned before. This latter view is the view we subscribe 
to and it is permissible in the Bohmian picture (Bohm & Hiley, 1993). 
 
The implication of the second view is far-reaching. It means that quantum 
entanglement can influence chemical and biochemical reactions and other physical 
processes. Thus, it plays vital roles in many biological processes and consciousness 
and is the genuine cause of many anomalous effects, if they do exist, in 
parapsychology, alternative medicine and other fields as some authors have already 
suspected in some case. It can affect the micro- and macroscopic properties of all 
forms of matters such solid and liquid. 
 
For example, the results reported by Rey (2003) that heavy water and highly 
diluted solutions of sodium chloride and lithium chloride behaved differently in the 
thermo- luminescence tests can be explained as the consequence of water molecules 
forming different hydrogen bonds due to the entanglement of water molecule with 
sodium chloride or lithium chloride ions being diluted out of existence and its 
subsequent effect on hydrogen bond formation during freezing. Indeed, in light of the 
recent results on observable macroscopic entanglement effects (Arnesen, et al, 2001; 
Ghost et al, 2003), the explanation offered herein is most likely true. 
 
For a second example, the so called “memory of water” effect (Davenas, et al, 
1988), which is largely discredited by the mainstream scientists because of non-
reproducibility, can be explained as the result of entanglement of the substances 
being diluted with water and then the subsequent entanglement of water with the 

 
60
quantum entities in the biochemical processes responsible for producing certain 
visible or detectable result. Of course, quantum entanglement cannot directly serve as 
a reagent in a chemical reaction nor can it be recorded or transferred through any 
classical means such as a digital device within a computer or the telephone wire. So 
any claim of recordable or telephone -wire-transferable “chemical signal” cannot be 
attributed to quantum entanglement. 
 
Similarly, the therapeutic effect of a homeopathic remedy, if it truly exists 
beyond and above the placebo effect, can be explained as the entanglement of the 
substances being diluted out of existence through vigorous shaking/stirring with the 
diluting solvent and then the subsequent entanglement of the solvent with the 
quantum entities involved in the diseased biological and/or physiological processes 
and the effect of such entanglement on the latter processes. Indeed, there are reports 
in the existing literature exploring the use of generalized entanglement to explain the 
therapeutic ingredient in a homeopathic remedy (See, e.g., Milgrom, 2002; Wallach, 
2000 & Weingärtner, 2003). 
 
Further, many other unconventional healing effects reported in alternative 
medicine such as Qi Gong and other types of bioenergy healing, if they are genuine, 
can be explained as the results of quantum entanglement between the quantum 
entities involved in the diseased processes and the quantum entities in the healing 
sources, such as a healthy biological entity, and the effect of the former on the latter 
processes. 
 
For yet another example, all the results from Princeton Engineering 
Anomalies Research program over the last 26 years (Jahn & Dunne, 2005) can also 
be straightforwardly explained as the entanglement of the quantum entities controlled 
by human mind with the quantum entities responsible for the physical processes 
capable of producing modified random results. By the same token, many if not all 
anomalous effects reported in parapsychology such as telepathy and those results 
reported by Grinberg- Zylberbaum (1987) and the repeaters (For a summary, see, 
Wackermann, 2005) can be simply explained as the results of quantum entanglement 
between the quantum entities capable of invoking action potentials in one person and 
those in a second person and the effect of one on the other through quantum 
entanglement. Grinberg-Zylberbaum himself speculated that his results had 
something to do with quantum entanglement (1994). 
4. 
The Ontological Origin of Quantum Computation Power 
 
It is said that the computational speed-up of a quantum computer is due to 
quantum entanglement (See, e.g., Steane, 2000). However, the ontological origin of 
its power over classical computation is very much in dispute due to different 
interpretations of quantum mechanics (id.). 

 
61
 
For example, some argue that, in terms of the amount of information 
manipulated in a given time, quantum superposition/entanglement permits quantum 
computers to ``perform many computations simultaneously'' which invoke the 
concept of vast numbers of parallel universes (See, e.g., Deutsch & Hayden, 2000; 
Deutsch, 2002). Others argue that quantum entanglement makes available types of 
computation process, which, while not exponentially larger than classical ones, are 
unavailable to classical systems (See, e.g., Steane, 2000). Thus, according to Steane 
(2000), the essence of quantum computation is that it uses entanglement to generate 
and manipulate a physical representation of the correlations between logical entities, 
without the need to completely represent the logical entities themselves (id.). 
 
Do we have anything to add in light of our view expressed in this paper? The 
answer is “Yes.” We argue that the types of computation process made available by 
quantum entanglement are the ones driven by the primordial spin processes in the 
non-spatial and non-temporal pre-sapcetime. Or, if you like, the power of quantum 
computation over classical computation originates from Bohm’s implicate order 
driven by the primordial spin processes. 
5. 
Applications of Quantum Entanglement 
 
Recently, quantum computations have been achieved in the laboratory but 
they are implemented in controlled environment to prevent decoherence through 
entanglement of the system of interests with its surrounding environment. Indeed, it is 
also often said that the reason why we don’t experience quantum entanglement in the 
macroscopic world is because of rapid decoherence within the macroscopic system. 
However, this view may rapidly change (See, e.g., Brooks, 2005). We are convinced 
that quantum entanglement can be harnessed, tamed and developed into revolutionary 
technologies to serve the mankind in many areas such as health, medicine and even 
recreation besides the emerging fields of quantum computation and communications. 
 
For example, once harnessed, quantum entanglement technologies can be 
used to deliver the therapeutic effects of many drugs to a target biological system 
such as a human body without ever physically administrating the said drugs to the 
said system. Such technology would dramatically reduce waste and increase 
productivity because the same drugs can be repeatedly used to deliver their 
therapeutic effects to the mass. By the same token, many substances of nutritional 
and even recreational values can be repeatedly administrated to the human body 
through the said technologies. For a second example, the harnessed quantum 
entanglement technologies can also be used to entangle two or more human minds for 
legitimate purposes. Further, the said technologies can be used for instantaneous 
communications with humans sent to the outer space. 

 
62
 
Are we delusional? We think not. We predict that the wonders of quantum 
entanglement technologies will be soon widely utilize to serve the mankind and a 
new paradigm of science will be born in the near future. 
6. 
Quantum Entanglement in Spin-Mediated Consciousness Theory 
 
Our spin-mediated consciousness theory says that quantum spin is the seat of 
consciousness and the linchpin between mind and the brain, that is, spin is the mind-
pixel (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2004a-d). The starting point is the fact that spin is basic 
quantum bit ("qubit") for encoding information and, on the other hand, neural 
membranes and proteins are saturated with nuclear spin carrying nuclei and form the 
matrices of brain electrical activities. Indeed, as discussed above, spin is embedded in 
the microscopic structure of spacetime as reflected by Dirac equation and is likely 
more fundamental than spacetime itself as implicated by Roger Penrose’s work. In 
the Hestenes picture the zitterbewegung associated with spin was shown to be 
responsible for the quantum effects of the fermion. Further, in the Bohm picture the 
internal motion associated with spin has been shown to be responsible for the 
quantum potential which, in turn, is responsible for quantum effects. Thus, if one 
adopts the minority quantum mind view, nuclear spins and possibly unpaired electron 
spins become natural candidates for mind-pixels (Hu & Wu, 2002; 2003; 2004a-d). 
 
Applying these ideas to the particular structures and dynamics of the brain, we 
have theorized that human brain works as follows: Through action potential 
modulated nuclear spin interactions and paramagnetic O2/NO driven activations, the 
nuclear spins inside neural membranes and proteins form various entangled quantum 
states and, in turn, the collective dynamics of the said entangled quantum states 
produces consciousness through contextual, irreversible and non-computable means 
and influences the classical neural activities through spin chemistry (Hu & Wu, 2002; 
2003; 2004a-d). 
 
Existing literature supports the possibility of a spin-mediated consciousness. 
For example, it was shown that proton nuclear spins in nematic liquid crystal could 
achieve long-lived intra-molecular quantum coherence with entanglement in room 
temperature for information storage (Khitrin et al, 2002). Long-ranged (>10 microns) 
intermolecular multiple-quantum coherence in NMR spectroscopy was discovered 
about a decade ago (Warren, et al 1993). Long-lived (>.05 milliseconds) 
entanglement of two macroscopic spin ensembles in room temperature has been 
achieved recently (Julsgaard, et al. 2001). Further, NMR quantum computation in 
room temperature is reality (Gershenfeld & Chuang, 1997). 
 
Therefore, according to our theory, consciousness is intrinsically connected to 
the spin process and emerges from the collective dynamics of various entangled spin 
states and the unity of mind is achieved by entanglement of these mind-pixels (Hu & 
Wu, 2002; 2003; 2004a-d). Our theory is tentative as are all current theories about 

 
63
consciousness. As with other quantum mind theories, decoherence is a major concern 
as pointed out by Tegmark (2000) but may not be insurmountable (See, e.g., Hagan, 
et.al., 2002). We believe that the solution will be found through the study of the 
nature of quantum entanglement. 
 
Indeed, our dualistic approach adopted earlier (Hu & Wu, 2002) and 
described in more detail in this paper allows mind to utilize quantum entanglement to 
achieve the unity of mind in pre-spacetime. The essential question is then how does 
mind process and harness the information from the mind-pixels which form various 
entangled spin states so that it can have conscious experience. We have argued that 
contextual, irreversible and non-computable means within pre-spacetime are utilized 
by mind to do this. Furthermore, we recognize that there may not be any large-scale 
quantum coherence in the warm and wet brain to support those quantum theories of 
mind that require macroscopic quantum effects. However, our theory does not depend 
on such a coherence to work in the dualistic approach. 
7.  
Conclusion 
 
In this article, we have discussed the ontological origin, implications and 
applications of quantum entanglement by thinking outside the standard interpretations 
of quantum mechanics. We have argued that quantum entanglement originates from 
the primordial self-referential spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-
spacetime, implies genuine interconnectedness and inseparableness of once 
interacting quantum entities, play vital roles in biology and consciousness and, once 
better understood and harnessed, has far-reaching consequences and applications in 
many fields such as medicine and neuroscience. It follows then that quantum 
computation power also originates from the primordial spin processes in pre-
spacetime. We have also discussed the roles of quantum entanglement in our spin-
mediated consciousness theory. 
 
 
Finally, the principle of science dictates that a scientific theory/hypothesis 
should only achieve legitimacy if it is experimentally verified. Thus, since the 
summer of 2004 to the present, we have mainly focused our efforts on the 
quantification of our theory and the designs and implementations of computer 
simulations and experiments for the verifications of the same. Important results shall 
be reported as soon as feasible.

Although theories and speculations abound, there is no consensus on the 
origin or cause of gravity. Presumably, this status of affair is due to the lack of any 
experimental guidance. In this paper, we will discuss its ontological origin, 
implications and potential applications by thinking outside the mainstream notions of 
general relativity and quantum gravity. We argue that gravity originates from the 
primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-spacetime, is the 
manifestation of quantum entanglement, and implies genuine instantaneous 
interconnectedness of all matters in the universe. That is, we advocate the principle of 
non-local action. To certain degree, our view is a reductionist expression of Newton’s 
instantaneous universal gravity and Mach’s Principle with important consequences. 
We also discuss the role of gravity in consciousness from this new perspective. 
Indeed, if spin is the primordial self-referential cause of everything, it should also be 
the cause of gravity. 
 Key Words: Gravity, Spin, Entanglement, Instantaneity, Interconnectedness, Consciousness

Introduction 
 
This paper is an extension of our earlier papers advocating a holistic and 
unified theme of reality in which spin is the primordial self-referential process driving 
quantum mechanics, spacetime dynamics and consciousness (1-5). Briefly, we have 
proposed a spin-mediated consciousness theory in which spin is the mind-pixel (1), 
outlined a unified theme of reality based on spin (2), offered our views on the essence 
and implications of quantum entanglement (3), and conducted experiments which 
indeed support our propositions (4-5). In particular, our experiments show that (a)

biologically/chemically meaningful information can be transmitted through quantum 
entanglement; (b) both classical and quantum information can be transmitted between 
locations of arbitrary distances through quantum entanglement; (c) instantaneous 
signaling is physically real; and (d) brain processes such as perception and other 
biological processes likely involve quantum information and nuclear and/or 
electronic spins are likely play important roles in these processes. 
 
While our primary focus at the present is till experimental studies, we would 
like to offer our view on the origin, implications and potential applications of gravity. 
The connection between quantum entanglement and Newton’s instantaneous 
universal gravity and Mach’s Principle is natural. To certain degree, our view is a 
reductionist expression of this connection with important consequences. Readers are 
again advised that our propositions are outside mainstream physics and other authors 
may hold similar views on some of the points we shall make. Some readers are 
further advised to treat this paper as an Ed-Op piece so as to avoid being offended. 
However, we are deadly serious about our propositions and put our money where our 
mouth is. 
 
Microscopically gravity is assumed to be fable and negligible and 
macroscopically it is ubiquitous and pervasive. It seems to penetrate everything and 
cannot be shielded. However, there is no consensus as to its cause despite of the 
efforts of many people. Presumably, this status of affair is due to the lack of any 
experimental guidance. There are many general and technical papers written on the 
subject. So cutting to the chase, we shall immediately outline our propositions and 
then discuss each in some detail with reference to existing literatures whenever 
possible. Our propositions are as follows: 
4) Gravity originates from the primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-
temporal pre-spacetime and is the macroscopic manifestation of quantum 
entanglement. 
5) Thus, gravity is nonlocal and instantaneous, as Newton reluctantly assumed 
and Mach suggested. It implies that all matters in the universe are 
instantaneously interconnected and many anomalous effects in astronomy 
such as red shift, dark energy, dark mass and Pioneer effect may be resolved 
from this perspective. 
6) Potentially, gravity can be harnessed, tamed and developed into revolutionary 
technologies to serve the mankind in many areas such as instantaneous 
communication, spacetime engineering and space travel. 
2. 
The Origin and Nature of Gravity 
 
The idea of instantaneous gravity is nothing new. Newton’s law of universal 
gravitation implies instantaneous “action at a distance” which he felt deeply 
uncomfortable with, but Newton was not able to find a cause of gravity (6). Later 

 
69
Mach suggested that "[t]he investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the 
immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe…[t]here will hover before 
him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated 
and inertial motions will result in the same way" (7). Ontologically, Mach’s above 
suggestion is a form of holism and implies that gravity is relational and instantaneous. 
 
It was Einstein who fulfilled Mach’s “relational” suggestion of gravity by 
inventing general relativity (8). He also coined the phrase Mach’s principle. 
However, such fulfillment is at the sacrifice of Mach’s “immediate connections” by 
assuming that the speed of gravity is the speed of light. Einstein’s general relativity is 
now the mainstream theory of gravity, but it is in conflict with quantum mechanics – 
the most successful theory of the 20th century which Einstein himself helped to build. 
Einstein called quantum entanglement “spooky action at a distance” in the famous 
EPR debate (9). However, it seems that Einstein’s camp is on the losing side of the 
debate today as many recent experiments have shown that quantum entanglement is 
physically real (e.g., 10-11). We suggest that a theory of gravity, which includes 
general relativity as an approximation, be built from the properties of quantum 
entanglement. 
 
Ontologically, we have argued that quantum entanglement arises from the 
primordial self-referential spin processes which are envisioned by us as the driving 
force behind quantum mechanics, spacetime dynamics and consciousness (2). 
Pictorially, two interacting quantum entities such as two electrons get entangled with 
each other through the said spin processes in pre-spacetime. Such ontological 
interpretation is supported by existing literature as discussed previously (2). Here we 
focus our discussion on spin as the primordial process driving space-time dynamics 
including gravity. 
 
First, spin is deeply connected to the microscopic structure of spacetime as 
reflected by the Dirac equation for Dirac spinor field representing the fermions (12). 
Indeed, Penrose (13-14) had considered early on that spin might be more fundamental 
than spacetime and invented spinor and twistor algebras for a combinatorial 
description of spacetime geometry. Bohm and Hiley (15) generalized the twistor idea 
to Clifford algebra as a possible basis for describing Bohm’s “implicit order.” 
Recently various spin foams have been formulated as extensions to Penrose’s spin 
networks for the purpose of constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity (16). 
Many others have also study the nature of spin from both classical and quantum- 
mechanical perspectives. For example, Newman showed that spin might have a 
classical geometric origin. By treating the real Maxwell Field and real linearized 
Einstein equations as being embedded in complex Minkowski space, he was able to 
interpret spin-angular momentum as arising from a charge and “mass monopole” 
source moving along a complex world line (17). 

 
70
 
Second, Sidharth (18-19) has discussed the nature of spin within the context 
of quantized fractal spacetime and showed that spin is symptomatic of the non-
commutative geometry of space-time at the Compton scale of a fermion and the three 
dimensionality of the space result from the spinorial behavior of fermions. He 
showed that mathematically an imaginary shift of the spacetime coordinate in the 
Compton scale of a fermion introduces spin ½ into general relativity and curvature to 
the fermion theory (18). The reason why an imaginary shift is associated with spin is 
to be found in the quantum mechanical zitterbewegung within the Compton scale and 
the consequent quantized fractal space-time (18). Further, according to Sidharth (19), 
a fermion is like a Kerr-Newman black hole within the Compton scale of which 
causality and locality fails. 
 
Third, Burinskii has recently shown that in spite of the weakness of the local 
gravitational field, the gravity for a spin ½ fermion as derived using the classical 
Kerr-Newman Kerr solution (Kerr’s Gravity) has very strong stringy, topological and 
non-local action on the Compton distances of the fermion, polarizing the space-time 
and electromagnetic field and controlling the basic quantum properties of the 
fermions (20). Thus, Kerr’s Gravity may suggest possibly deep connections between 
the mass-energy relationship of matter and the quantum properties of particles (20). 
 
Fourth, Makhlin has recently shown that the axial field component in the spin 
connections of the Dirac spinor field provides an effective mechanism of auto-
localization of the Dirac spinor field into compact objects, presumably representing 
the fermions, and condition that the compact objects are stable leads to the Einstein's 
field equations (21). He suggested that the physical origin of the macroscopic forces 
of gravity between any two bodies is a trend of the global Dirac spinor field to 
concentrate around the microscopic domains where this field happens to be extremely 
localized (21). He further suggested that the long distance effect of the axial field is 
indistinguishable from the Newton's gravity which according to him reveals the 
microscopic nature of gravity and the origin of the gravitational mass (21). 
 
Further, Penrose-Hameroff’s self-organized objective reduction model of 
spacetime geometry (22) also implies that the spacetime dynamics is driving by 
certain self-referential process. In addition, Cahill’s work on a self-referentially 
limited neural-network model of reality (23) supports the view of a primordial self-
referential network underlying reality. 
 
We emphasize that pre-spacetime in this article means a non-spatial and non-
temporal domain but it is not associated with an extra-dimension in the usual sense 
since there is no distance or time in such domain (2-3). So pre-spacetime is a holistic 
domain located outside spacetime but connected through quantum entanglement to 
everywhere in spacetime enabling Newton’s instantaneous universal gravity and 
Mach’s “immediate connections.” It has similarity to Bohm’s concept of implicate 
order (24) and other non-local hidden variable theories (25-26). The said pre-

 
71
spacetime is a “world” beyond Einstein’s relativistic world through which quantum 
entanglement can be used to produce instantaneous signaling as we have 
demonstrated experimentally (4-5). 
 
In short, existing literatures cited above support the proposition that spin is the 
primordial process driving space-time dynamics. Since we have argued previously 
that quantum entanglement also originates from the primordial spin process, it is 
natural to link gravity to the property of quantum entanglement. Indeed, doing so will 
not only provide a cause to Newton’s instantaneous universal gravity but also realize 
Mach’s “immediate connections’ discussed above. Therefore, we propose that gravity 
originates from the primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-
spacetime and is the macroscopic manifestation of quantum entanglement. 
3. 
Implications of Gravity from This New Perspective 
 
At the present we are contemplating a mathematical framework from which 
the primordial self-referential spin process produces everything including gravity. 
There are several exiting approaches which provide some hints as to the said 
mathematical forms. These approaches are all based non-local hidden variables, that 
is, the principle of non-local action. They include Bohmian mechanics (15, 24), 
Adler’s trace dynamics (25), Smolin’s stochastic approach (26) and Cahill’s process 
physics (23). 
 
In additions, other existing alternative approaches on gravity may also provide 
some hints. For sample, Sakharov’s induced gravity is a well known alternative 
theory of quantum gravity in which gravity emerges as a property of matter fields 
(27). In comparison, we advocate herein that gravity is a property of quantum 
entanglement. 
The implication of this new perspective on gravity is far-reaching. It implies that 
gravity is non-local and instantaneous, as Newton reluctantly assumed and Mach 
suggested, all matters in the universe are instantaneously interconnected and, 
therefore, many anomalous effects in astronomy such as dark energy, dark mass and 
Pioneer effects may be resolved from this perspective and within a framework of 
non-local cosmology. 
4. 
Potential Applications of Gravity from This New Perspective 
 
 
We are convinced that gravity, as the macroscopic manifestation of quantum 
entanglement, can be harnessed, tamed and developed into revolutionary technologies 
to serve the mankind in many areas. 
For example, once harnessed, non-local gravity may be used to communicate 
between locations of arbitrary distances instantaneously. Such technology would 

 
72
dramatically decrease the communication delay to spacecraft in outer space. For a 
second example, once tamed, powerful non-local gravity may be used to engineer the 
structures of spacetime and propel a new kind of spacecraft for advanced space travel. 
Is this for real? You bet. We put our money where our mouth is and predict that the 
wonders of non-local gravity technologies will soon be widely utilize to serve the 
mankind and a new paradigm of science will be born in the near future. 
5. 
The Role of Gravity in Consciousness 
 
As manefestation of quantum entanglement, the role of gravity in 
consciousness is to achieve binding. In our spin-mediated consciousness theory, such 
role played by gravity is not hard to see, since spin is the seat of consciousness and 
the linchpin between mind and the brain, that is, spin is the mind-pixel (1). According 
to our theory, the nuclear spins and possibly electron spins inside neural membranes 
and proteins form various entangled quantum states through action potential 
modulated nuclear spin interactions and paramagnetic O2/NO driven activations and, 
in turn, the collective dynamics of the said entangled quantum states produces 
consciousness and influences the classical neural activities through spin chemistry 
(1). 
 
As with other quantum mind theories, decoherence is a major concern as 
pointed out by Tegmark (28) but may not be insurmountable (29). We are convinced 
that the solution lies with quantum entanglement. Indeed, our dualistic approach 
adopted earlier allows mind to utilize quantum entanglement to achieve the unity of 
mind in pre-spacetime (1). The essential question is then how does mind process and 
harness the information from the mind-pixels which form various entangled states so 
that it can have conscious experience. We have argued that contextual, irreversible 
and non-computable means within pre-spacetime are utilized by mind to do this. 
6. 
Conclusion 
 
 
In this paper we have discussed the ontological origin, implications and 
potential applications of gravity by thinking outside mainstream notions of general 
relativity and quantum gravity. We have proposed that gravity originates from the 
primordial self-referential spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-
spacetime, is the macroscopic manifestation of quantum entanglement, implies 
instantaneous interconnectedness of all maters in the universe and, once better 
understood and harnessed, has far-reaching consequences and applications in many 
areas such as instantaneous communication, spacetime engineering and space travel. 
We have also discussed the role of gravity in our spin-mediated consciousness theory 
from this new perspective. Finally, the principle of science dictates that a 
hypothesis/proposition should only achieve scientific legitimacy if it is 

 
73
experimentally verified. Thus, we have designed and carried out experiments to 
verify our propositions and the results will be reported separately.

Thinking Outside the Box III: How Mind Influences Brain Through Proactive Spin

ABSTRACT 
Benjamin has written an article entitled “Dark Chemistry or Psychic Spin Pixel?” which promotes a 
“dark chemistry” model of mind and discuss the spin-mediated theory. This hypothetical chemistry is 
based on the hypothetical axion dark matter. Based on our recent experimental findings, our 
contentions are two-fold: (1) dark matter is likely the cosmological manifestation of quantum 
entanglement; and (2) the hypothetical axion dark matter is, therefore, replaceable by non-local effects 
mediated by the primordial spin processes. We also discuss the cause of apparent dark energy. In 
particular, we explore the issue how mind influences the brain through said spin processes. Our 
thoughts are that the manifestation of free will is intrinsically associated with the nuclear and/or 
electron spin processes inside the varying high electric voltage environment of the neural membranes 
and proteins which likely enable the said spin processes to be “proactive,” that is, being able to utilize 
non-local energy (potential) and quantum information to influence brain activities through spin 
chemistry and possibly other chemical/physical processes in defiance of the second law of 
thermodynamics.

1. 
On “Dark Chemistry” Model 
 
 
Benjamin has written an article entitled “Dark Chemistry or Psychic Spin 
Pixel?” (Benjamin, 2007) which promotes a “dark chemistry” model of mind and 
discuss the spin mediated theory (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2004a & 2004b) and the 
Hameroff-Penrose model (Hameroff & Penrose, 1996). One may recall that dark 
matter is a hypothetical matter of unknown composition whose presence is inferred 
from its gravitational effects on visible matter, dark energy is a hypothetical form of 
energy that permeates all of space and tends to increase the apparent rate of 
expansion of the universe, and axion is a hypothetical elementary particle postulated 
to resolve the lack of CP-violation in the physics of quarks and gluons (Source: 
Wikipedia). Axion is a candidate for dark matter. Benjamin’s “dark chemistry” is a 
hypothetical chemistry based on the hypothetical axion dark matter. Benjamin claims 
that his model is necessary because “quantum parameters such as spin are universal, 
while discernible mental phenomena are not[, so] a homunculus seems necessary to 
provide an adequate ontological substrate for mind, to avoid an integration of infinite 
regress” (Benjamin, 2007). 
 

 
76
 
Benjamin is commendable for boldly going where no one has gone before. 
However, we are afraid that Benjamin, possibly a few other individuals, has 
misunderstood what is spin-mediated consciousness theory. Our theory is an 
ontological theory and, in its dualistic embodiment, a non-spatial and non-temporal 
pre-spacetime (nonlocal domain) is the homunculus (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2004a & 
2004b). Our concept of spin, being the primordial self-referential process, is much 
more than a passive quantum parameter. It is the mind-pixel, the linchpin between 
mind and the brain and the ultimate stop-gap of infinite regress through self-reference 
in pre-spacetime; or, as Benjamin put it, spin is “psychic” (id). It is through the self-
referential spin processes that a conscious being such as a human perceives and 
interacts with the external/physical world. In other words, spin is a process capable 
being “proactive” in the brain. To justify such view, we would like to point out that in 
both Hestenes' geometric formulation of quantum mechanics (Hestenes, 1983) and 
Bohm's non-local hidden variable formulation it has been shown that spin is solely 
responsible for all the quantum effects (Esposito, 1999). Further, although spin is 
universal, the reason why it allows the brain to have conscious experience and free 
will is because of the particular structures and dynamics of the brain as discussed 
elsewhere (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2004a & 2004b) and further below. 
 
 
As we understand it, the gist of Benjamin’s model is a homunculus or 
invisible axion body running along the visible physical body which interacts with said 
physical body through dark chemistry and serves as the host of the soul/spirit in order 
to avoid infinite regress. Further, according to Benjamin, the axion body is made of 
intransient non-electric particles and virtually a hologram integrating the patterns of 
information at various levels. Presumably (we guess), dark chemistry involves “the 
resonance between the dark and visible bodies of an organism” and “dynamic 
biophoton process of kindling and quenching the "potential" of the [holographic] 
pattern” (Benjamin, 2007). 
 
 
We agree with Benjamin that “[m]ind and consciousness need not be mystical 
or magical” (Benjamin, 2007). However, his “dark chemistry” model is very 
convoluted because it involves all these hypothetical and/or exotic entities such as 
dark matter, dark particle, dark body, invisible axion, non-electric particle, 
homunculus, biophoton and graviton. Someone has already commented that “I think 
that having learned how many new entities are put here into play to explain 
consciousness, William [of] Occam would turn in his tomb” (Patlavskiy, 2007). 
 
In the following sections, we shall argue that Benjamin may find himself still 
in the “bright” territory instead of the “dark” side, if he is willing to do an exercise 
with Occam’s razor, cutting out “dark” things and replacing them with non-local 
effects mediated by the “psychic” spin. Based on our recent experimental findings 
(Hu & Wu, 2006a-d; 2007a), our contentions are two-fold: (1) dark matter is likely 
the cosmological manifestation of quantum entanglement; and (2) Benjamin’s 
hypothetical dark matter axion, therefore, is replaceable by non-local effects mediated 
by the primordial spin processes. We will also discuss the cause of dark energy and 

 
77
touch upon how universe operates without Big Bang and speculate what are Black 
Holes. 
 
 
In particular, we shall explore the issue how mind influences the brain 
through the primordial self-referential spin processes which, we admit, have not 
addressed in detail previously. Our thoughts are that the manifestation of free will is 
intrinsically associated with the nuclear and/or electron spin processes inside the 
varying high electric voltage environment of the neural membranes and proteins 
which likely enable the said spin processes to be “proactive,” that is, being able to 
utilize non-local energy (potential) and quantum information in pre-spacetime 
(nonlocal domain) to influence brain activities through spin chemistry and possibly 
other chemical/physical processes in defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. 
 
 
2. 
The Origin of Dark Matter and Dark Energy 
 
 
Before we go on, we would like to state that Einstein is no doubt one of the 
greatest minds ever lived. He made monumental contributions to physics from 
explaining photoelectrical effect and Brownian motion to constructing special theory 
of relativity, the famous formula E=mc2 and Bose-Einstein Statistics. But just 
because Einstein is great does not mean that he was infallible as the case with EPR 
(Einstein at al, 1935) debate and his general theory of relativity (“GTR,” see Einstein, 
1915). We are all human and fallible. In any case, whatever happens, GTR is till an 
effective (approximate) theory for some parts of the universe such as our own solar 
system. 
 
 
With this being said, it is likely, we contend, that Einstein’s GTR is 
ontologically invalid because our experimental results indicate that gravity is 
nonlocal and instantaneous (Hu & Wu, 2006a-d; 2007a) as Newton reluctantly 
assumed (Newton, 1999 by Cohen et al) and Mach conjectured (Mach, 1960 by Open 
Court Pub. Co.) and a few other authors argued (e.g., Pope & Osborne, 1996). 
Besides, many experiments have shown that quantum entanglement is physically real 
(e.g., Aspect, 1982; Julsgaard et al, 2001) which implies that Einstein’s theories of 
relativity are in real not imagined conflict with quantum theory. Until now, relativists 
have been able to hide behind the no-signaling “veil” because of the Eberhard 
Theorem (Eberhard, 1978). But that “veil” has been pierced and we must deal with 
reality. We understand that pointing out the real possibility that “the Emperor 
(Einstein) has no clothes” as far as GTR is concerned will irritate a great number of 
scientists in the mainstream, especially those on the superstring bandwagon, and may 
eventually destroy jobs, livelihood and research grants. But we need to ask ourselves 
the soul searching question: Are we here for truth and the greater benefit of mankind 
or our self-interests? and do we want to go down in history as conniving hypocrites or 
truth-seeking scientists? And so, as John F. Kennedy would urge, my fellow 
Scientists: ask not what mankind can do for you but what can you do for mankind. 

 
78
 
We have proposed in a previous paper that: (1) gravity originates from the 
primordial spin processes in non-spatial and non-temporal pre-spacetime (nonlocal 
domain) and is the macroscopic manifestation of quantum entanglement; and (2) thus, 
gravity is nonlocal and instantaneous which implies that all matters in the universe 
are instantaneously interconnected and many anomalous effects in astronomy such as 
dark matter, dark matter, red shift and Pioneer effect may be resolved from this 
perspective (Hu & Wu, 2007b). 
 
Experimentally, we have found that the gravity of water in a detecting 
reservoir quantum-entangled with water in a remote reservoir can change when the 
latter was remotely manipulated such that, it is hereby predicted, the gravitational 
energy/potential is globally conserved (Hu & Wu, 2006a-d; 2007a). We have also 
found that the pH value and temperature of water in a detecting reservoir quantum-
entangled with water in a remote reservoir changes when the latter is manipulated 
under the condition that the water in the detecting reservoir is able to exchange 
energy with its local environment (id). Thus, among other things we have realized 
non-local signaling using three different physical observables and experimentally 
demonstrated Newton's instantaneous gravity and Mach's instantaneous connection 
conjecture and the relationship between gravity and quantum entanglement. Our 
findings also imply that the properties of all matters can be affected non-locally 
through quantum entanglement mediated processes. Second, the second law of 
thermodynamics may not hold when two quantum-entangled systems together with 
their respective local environments are considered as two isolated systems and one of 
them is manipulated. Third, gravity has a non-local aspect associated with quantum 
entanglement thus can be non-locally manipulated through quantum entanglement 
mediated processes (id). Therefore, our findings support a non-local cosmology (Hu 
& Wu, 2007b). 
 
In light of these developments, we now ask the question what is the origin of 
dark matter and dark energy. To stray a bit, we further “naively” ask the question 
how universe operates if the Big Bang didn’t happen. Since modern Big Bang theory 
and Black Holes are based on Einstein’s GTR, there is a good chance that Big Bang 
didn’t happen and apparent Black Holes are not actually Black Holes. There are many 
technical and general papers written in these areas too numerous to mention. 
 
It is our current view that the universe is regenerative: It probably had no 
beginning and will have no ending, but is constantly and dynamically regenerated 
through cosmological processes associated with the primordial self-referential spin 
processes (Hu & Wu, 2003 & 2004b). These spin processes have two aspects: one 
aspect is expressive being associated with the concept of differentiation, negative 
entropy and David Bohm’s unfolding (Bohm & Hiley, 1993); the other is regressive 
being associated with the concept of un-differentiation, entropy and David Bohm’s 
enfolding (Id). In our view dark matter is the cosmological manifestation of quantum 
entanglement associated with the regressive and un-differentiating aspect of the 

 
79
primordial self-referential spin process (Hu & Wu, 2003 & 2004b) but seen as 
additional gravity caused by invisible matter under some cosmological conditions. In 
contrast, dark energy is the cosmological manifestation of reverse quantum 
entanglement associated with the expressive and differentiating aspect of the 
primordial self-referential spin process but seen as anti-gravity caused by negative 
pressure on the cosmological scale. 
 
It is also our current view that entropy is really about regression and un-
differentiation in which explicate and differentiated orders regress/un-differentiate (or 
become chaotic or random due to missing information, that is, our own ignorance due 
to complexity) through spin-mediated enfolding (quantum entanglement). On the 
other hand, it is our view that negative entropy is really about expression and 
differentiation in which hidden orders in pre-spacetime become explicate and 
differentiated under the right conditions through spin-mediated unfolding (reverse 
quantum entanglement) in which the second law of thermodynamics does not apply. 
 
Besides the ever-evolving Life on earth, where can we find these expressions 
in a dynamic and regenerative universe? The famous but controversial Russian 
physicist N.A. Kozyrev suggested long time ago that stars, such as our own Sun, are 
machines generating energy through “active time” (e.g., Kozyrev, 2006 in PiP) 
instead of nucleosysthesis which would died out or not exist at all if the universe had 
no beginning. The energy researcher Harold Aspden has also for a long time 
advocated the view that the main source of the Sun’s energy is not from 
nucleosynthesis but the age-old ether which fills the vacuum of space and could be 
converted into thermal radiation because of the particular composition and structure 
of the Sun (e.g., Aspden, 2006). Well, one may not agree with the details of the 
Kozyrev or Aspden model, we suggest that the Sun may well be producing thermal 
radiations through spin-mediated expressive processes converting nonlocal energy 
(potential) in pre-spacetime into regular energy in spacetime. 
 
Further, there is also the possibility that those apparent Black Holes are 
actually the centers of more violent regenerative cosmological processes in display. 
On the one hand, these structures violently express (unfold) nonlocal energy into 
visible matter with said expressive process being seen as dark energy. But, on the 
other hand, they also violently crush (enfold) visible matter into nonlocal energy with 
the patterns of said visible matter being seen as the symptom of a Black Hole and said 
regressive process being seen as dark matter. Of course, other authors probably have 
already expressed similar views from different angles or perspectives (See, e.g., Pope 
& Robinson, 2007).

3. 
How Mind Influences Brain through “Proactive” Spin 
 
We will now explore how mind influences the brain, through the primordial 
self-referential spin processes (Hu & Wu, 2002, 2003 & 2004a&b), which, we admit, 
have not addressed in detail previously. All we have said was that the collective 
dynamics of nuclear and/or electron spin ensembles in neural membranes and protein 
is able to affect the neural activities of the brain through spin chemistry (Id). 
However, in order to purposefully influence neural activities inside the brain so that a 
conscious being such as a human can interact with the external world and have free 
will, the said nuclear and/or electron spin ensembles have to be able to either self-
organize to produce free-will-enabling emergent property which cannot be deduced 
from the spin properties or self-refer to their primordial origin, the non-spatial and 
non-temporal pre-spacetime (nonlocal domain) which in a dualistic embodiment 
hosts the mind and is the container of nonlocal energy (potential). 
 
As we have discussed elsewhere, the brain is an electrically very active place 
where the electric field strengths inside the neural membranes and proteins during a 
typical action potential oscillates between -9 to +6 million volts per meter which are 
comparable to those causing electroporation of cell membranes and dielectric 
breakdown of many materials (Hu & Wu, 2004c&d). So, these electrical fields and 
their modulations through the action potentials significantly affect the conformations 
and orientations of neural membrane components such as phospholipids, cholesterols 
and proteins. Indeed, voltage-dependent ion channels perform their functions through 
electric field induced conformation changes of the constituent proteins and studies on 
the effects of electric fields on lipids support the above conclusion (Id). We have 
shown that nuclear spin networks in neural membranes are modulated by action 
potentials through J-coupling, dipolar coupling and chemical shielding tensors and 
perturbed by microscopically strong and fluctuating internal magnetic fields produced 
largely by paramagnetic oxygen (Id). We have suggested that these spin networks 
could be involved in brain functions since said modulation inputs information carried 
by the neural spike trains into them, said perturbation activates various dynamics 
within them and the combination of the two likely produce stochastic resonance thus 
synchronizing said dynamics to the neural firings (Id). 
 
Here we specifically propose the following: (1) the varying high electric 
voltages, being modulated by the action potentials inside the neural membranes and 
proteins, not only are able to input information into the nuclear and/or electron spin 
ensembles inside them but also are able to change the characters and properties of 
these spin ensembles and the pre-spacetime associated with them, making these spins 
to be “proactive;” and (2) the “proactive” spins so enabled allow the mind to utilize 
non-local energy (potential) and quantum information to influence brain activities 
through spin chemistry and possibly other chemical/physical processes in defiance of 
the second law of thermodynamics. 

 
81
 
What plausible evidence do we have to support our above, some would say 
“outrageous,” proposition? The answer is that we indeed do have some evidence 
supporting this proposition. First, our own recent experiments as discussed earlier and 
elsewhere shows that nonlcoal signaling and nonlocal effects mediated by quantum 
entanglement are physically real (Hu & Wu, 2006a-d; 2007a).  Our results also imply 
that systems driven by quantum information such as our brain may defy second law 
of thermodynamics (Id). Second, the well-known placebo effect clearly indicates the 
influence of the mind over body. 
 
Further, there are many experimental reports in parapsychology showing the 
possibility or at least plausibility of mind’s influences over brain or matter. Of course, 
one always needs to be very careful about drawing conclusions and inferences from 
these reports. Just to mention a few, the PEAR Lab’s results accumulated over the 
years shows that mind could alter, however small, random number sequences (e.g., 
Jahn & Dunn, 2005). William Tiller has reported that under a particular circumstance 
mind could influence the pH value of water in a remote location through an 
embedded device (e.g., Tiller, 2007). Danielle Graham and her group have recently 
reported anomalous gravitational and electromagnetic effects of certain trained 
persons during meditations (Graham, 2006). Indeed, Dean Radin has documented 
many related results in his most recent book and was able to repeat and verify some 
of these results through the studies of his own group (Radin, 2006). 
 
In addition, in the areas of alternative energy, commonly labeled as the “back 
water” of energy research by the mainstream, there are numerous reports of excess 
heat being produced through electrophoreses and various plasma discharge schemes 
both in water and vacuum tubes (e.g., Graneau & Graneau, 1983; Correa & Correa, 
2004). The common feature shared by these reports is that somehow under the 
influence of electric fields or high electric voltages, excess heat was claimed to be 
produced from the vacuum or age-old ether. If some of these claims are true, we 
suggest that the source of the excess heat is the nonlocal energy (potential) in pre-
spacetime (nonlocal domain) which under the particular arrangements in those 
experiments was converted into regular energy in spacetime such as thermal 
radiation. 
5. 
Conclusion 
 
 
In this paper we have responded to Benjamin’s “dark chemistry” perspective. 
However, we have argued that his hypothetical dark matter axion is replaceable by 
non-local effects mediated by the primordial self-referential spin processes. This 
argument is based on our recent experimental findings which suggest that dark matter 
is likely the cosmological manifestation of quantum entanglement. In particular, we 
have explored the issue how mind influences the brain through the primordial self-
referential spin processes. Our current thoughts are that the manifestation of free will 
is intrinsically associated with the nuclear and/or electron spin processes inside the 

 
82
varying high electric voltage environment of the neural membranes and proteins 
which likely enable the said spin processes to be “proactive,” that is, being able to 
utilize non-local energy (potential) and quantum information to influence brain 
activities through spin chemistry and possibly other chemical/physical processes in 
defiance of the second law of thermodynamics. We have also discussed what dark 
energy is and touched upon the issues of Big Bang and Black Holes and made 
“naïve” speculations about them. If anyone gets offended by these thoughts, we 
sincerely apologize. 
 
 
Finally, we cannot stress enough that “talk is cheap” and what really matter 
are what can be observed and measured experimentally. So our emphasis is still 
experimental studies and we have and will continue to “put our money where our 
mouth is” and let experimental observations and measurements to speak for 
themselves.

APPENDIX IV 
Concerning Spin as Mind-pixel: How Mind Interacts with Brain through 
Electric Spin Effects 
 
Huping Hu and Maoxin Wu 
 
(Dated: November 6, 2007) 
 
Abstract: Electric spin effects are effects of electric fields on the 
dynamics/motions of nuclear/electron spins and related phenomena. 
Since classical brain activities are largely electric, we explore here a 
model of mind-brain interaction within the framework of spin-
mediated consciousness theory in which these effects in the varying 
high-voltage electric fields inside neural membranes and proteins 
mediate mind-brain input and output processes. In particulars, we 
suggest that the input processes in said electric fields are possibly 
mediated by Dirac-Hestenes electric dipoles and/or spin transverse 
forces both of which are associated with the nuclear/electronic spin 
processes. We then suggest that the output processes (proactive spin 
processes) in said electric fields possibly also involve Dirac-Hestenes 
electric dipole interactions in said electric fields and Dirac negative 
energy extraction processes, shown by Solomon, of nuclei/electrons 
besides non-local processes driven by quantum information. We 
propose that these output processes modulate the action potentials, 
thus influencing the brain, by affecting the cross-membrane electric 
voltages and currents directly and/or indirectly through changing the 
capacitance, conductance and/or battery in the Hudgkin-Huxley 
model. These propositions are based on our own experimental 
findings, further theoretical considerations, and studies reported by 
others in the fields of spintronics, high-energy physics and alternative 
energy research.

1. Introduction 
Within the framework of spin-mediated 
consciousness theory, the nuclear and/or 
electronic spins are proposed to be the 
mind-pixels which interact with the brain 
through quantum effects, modulating and 
being modulated by various classical 
brain activities such as the action 
potentials (Hu & Wu, 2002 & 2004a-d). 
Since classical brain activities are largely 
electric and, in comparison, magnetic 
fields 
insides 
the 
brain 
are 
only 
microscopically strong but fluctuating, 
we have previously discussed how action 
potentials modulate the dynamics of 
nuclear/electron spin networks inside the 
brain 
through 
J-coupling, 
dipolar 
coupling and chemical shielding tensors, 
thus, feeding information into mind in 
the dualistic approach (Hu & Wu, 2004 c 
& 2004d). Further, based on our own 
experimental findings and work done by 
others, we have also discussed on how 
mind might influence brain through 
proactive spin processes enabled by the 
varying 
high-voltage 
electric 
fields 
inside the brain (Hu & Wu, 2006a-d & 
2007a-c). 
 
 
What we have not explored in 
details so far are the electric spin effects 
which are the direct effects of electric 
fields on the dynamics/motions of 
nuclear and/or electronic spins and 
related phenomena, and their possible 
roles in mind-brain interactions. 
 
 
Therefore, we explore here a 
more specific model of mind-brain 
interaction within aforesaid framework 
in which the said electric spin effects in 
the varying high-voltage electric fields 
inside neural membranes and proteins 
mediate mind-brain input and output 
processes. We first suggest that the input 
processes in said electric fields are 
possibly mediated by Dirac-Hestenes 
electric dipoles and/or spin transverse 
forces both of which are associated with 
the nuclei/electron spin processes. We 
then suggest that the output processes 
(proactive spin processes) in said electric 
fields possibly involve Dirac-Hestenes 
electric dipole interactions with in said 
electric fields also and Dirac negative 
energy extraction processes, as shown by 
Solomon (2006 &2007), of nuclei and/or 
electrons besides non-local processes 
driven by quantum information shown by 
us. We suggest that these output 
processes modulate the action potentials, 
thus influencing the brain, by affecting 
the cross-membrane electric voltages and 
currents 
directly 
and/or 
indirectly 
through 
changing 
the 
capacitance, 
conductance 
and/or 
battery 
in 
the 
Hudgkin-Huxley model. These propo-
sitions 
are 
based 
on 
our 
own 
experimental findings, further theoretical 
considerations within the framework of 
spin-mediated consciousness theory, and 
studies reported by others in the fields of 
spintronics, high-energy physics and 
alternative energy research. 
 
2. Dirac-Hestenes Electric Dipole 
It has been long known that in an 
external electric field, the Dirac particle 
such as an electron or nuclear sub-entity 
acts as if it has an imaginary electric 
moment |d|=ieh/4mc. Dirac was aware 
this in 1928 and wrote that “[t]he electric 
moment, being a pure imaginary … 
should not…appear in the model [and it] 
is doubtful whether the electric moment 
has any physical meaning ...” (Dirac, 
1928). Later, Dirac stated that “these 
extra terms involve some new physical 

 
87
effects, but since they are not real they 
do not lend themselves very directly to 
physical interpretation” (Dirac, 1983). 
 
It was Hestenes who showed that 
Dirac magnetic and electric dipole 
moments have same origin associated 
with spin and magnetization (For a 
review, 
see, 
Hestenes, 
2003). 
In 
Hestenes’ formulism, magnetic moment 
density is not directly proportional to the 
spin but “dually proportional.” The 
duality factor ei has the effect of 
generating an effective electric dipole 
moment for the Dirac particle. Hestenes 
commented that “this seems to conflict 
with experimental evidence that the 
electron has no detectable electric 
moment, but the issue is subtle” (Id). 
Other researchers have also shown 
recently that the magnetic and electric 
dipole moments of a fermion are closely 
related because they determine the real 
and imaginary part of the same physical 
quantity (Feng et al, 2001; Graesser & 
Thomas, 2002). 
 
Indeed, Silenko has recently shown 
in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation 
that although the influence of the electric 
dipole moment on the Dirac particle 
motion is negligibly small in an external 
electric field, it influences significantly 
the spin motion of the said particle 
(Silenko, 2006). 
 
In addition, in the classical models 
of the Dirac particle, fast oscillating 
electric dipole moments also appear 
(Rivas, 2005; Gauthier 2006). These 
findings coincide with earlier finding that 
a moving magnetic dipole induces an 
electric dipole d=(v/c2)×m, where m and 
v are respectively the magnetic moment 
and the velocity of the moving spin, as a 
relativistic effect (Rosser, 1964). Rivas 
(2005) believes that what is lacking in 
the typical quantum mechanical wave 
equation is this oscillating electric 
dipole. He states that “in general, the 
average value of this term in an electric 
field of smooth variation is zero, [but] in 
high intensity fields or in intergranular 
areas in which the effective potentials are 
low, but their gradients could be very 
high, this average value should not be 
negligible.” Rivas further showed that 
the electric moment of the classical Dirac 
electron 
could 
lead 
to 
interesting 
physical effects (Id). 
 
Here 
we 
specifically 
propose 
(Proposition I) that in the dualistic mind-
brain 
approach 
of 
spin-mediated 
consciousness theory the interactions 
between the Dirac-Hestenes electric 
dipoles of nuclei and/or electrons with 
the varying high-voltage electric fields 
inside the neural membranes and proteins 
directly feed information carried by the 
neural spike trains into mind through the 
varying high-voltage action potentials. 
 
Do we have any other justifications 
for Proposition I besides the points 
already discussed above? The answer, 
indeed, is “Yes.” First, even if the Dirac 
electric dipole is purely imaginary with 
no known physical consequence, we 
argue that in the dualistic mind-brain 
approach, it may serve as an information 
receiver in the non-local domain where 
mind resides for the simple reason that 
such non-local domain is likely amicable 
to a description by the imaginary 
numbers (See, e.g., Rauscher & Targ, 
2001). 
 

 
88
Second, following Hestenes (see, 
e.g., 2003) and possibly others, we 
strongly believe that the origin of the 
electric dipole is intrinsically associated 
with a Dirac particle actually being a 
composite entity with the un-manifested 
antiparticle inseparably accompanying 
the regular particle. Since the antiparticle 
sometimes shows up in our spacetime as 
real, we have reason to believe that the 
same in its un-manifested form is an 
active participant in the primordial self-
referential 
spin 
processes 
driving 
quantum mechanics, spacetime dynamics 
and consciousness as will be discussed 
elsewhere in due time (Also see, Hu & 
Wu, 2003 & 2004b). 
 
3. Spin Transverse Force 
Recent studies in spintronics have shown 
that an electric field will exert a 
transverse torque/force on a moving spin 
(see, e.g., Sun et al 2004; Shen, 2005). 
This is actually not hard to understand 
since according to special theory of 
relativity a moving spin in an electric 
field sees a magnetic field. 
 
 
Sun et al (2004) has shown that a 
moving spin is affected by an external 
electric field and feels a force/torque as 
m×[(v/c2)×E] where m and v are 
respectively the magnetic moment and 
the velocity of the moving spin and E is 
the external magnetic field. 
 
 
Shen (2005) has shown that, as a 
relativistic quantum mechanical effect, 
an external electric field exerts a 
transverse force on an electron spin 1/2 if 
the electron is moving. The said spin 
force, analogue to the Lorentz for on an 
electron charge in a magnetic field, is 
perpendicular to the electric field and the 
spin motion when the spin polarization is 
projected along the electric field (Id). 
 
 
Indeed, while this paper is been 
written, this effect has just been 
successfully used in the laboratory to flip 
the spin of an electron in a quantum dot 
by applying an oscillating electric field 
(Nowack, et al, 2007). The electric field 
induces 
coherent 
transitions 
(Rabi 
oscillations) between spin-up and spin-
down with 90° rotations as fast as ~55 ns 
and the analysis done by the authors 
indicates that the electrically-induced 
spin transitions are mediated by the spin-
orbit interaction (Id). 
 
Therefore, we specifically propose 
here (Proposition II) that the interactions 
between the moving nuclear/electronic 
spins in neural membranes and proteins 
and the varying high-voltage electric 
fields there directly feed information into 
mind 
in 
the 
dualistic 
mind-brain 
approach of spin mediated consciousness 
theory. 
To 
illustrate 
this 
particular 
mechanism, we now consider the spin 
transverse force exerted on a proton spin 
of a hydrogen atom connected to the 
carbon chain of a phosphate lipid located 
inside the neural membranes as shown in 
Figure 1. As the carbon chain rotates in 
parallel to the intense electric field E 
across the neural membranes, the vertical 
proton 
spin 
moving 
in 
a 
circle 
perpendicular to the carbon chain sees a 
magnetic field in the rotating frame of 
reference 
thus 
feels 
a 
transverse 
torque/force f toward the rotating plane. 
Quantitative 
calculations 
shall 
be 
performed in a separate paper.

torque/force

on 
a 
nuclear/electronic spin on a molecular 
chain or fragment inside the neural 
membranes and proteins. 
 
This spin transverse torque/force 
enables the neural spike trains to directly 
influence the nuclear/electronic spin 
networks in neural membranes and 
proteins thus inputting information into 
mind in the dualistic approach. 
4. Output Process through Proactive Spin 
Previously, we have explored how mind 
influences the brain through primordial 
self-referential spin processes (Hu & 
Wu, 2007c). Our thoughts were that the 
manifestation of free will is intrinsically 
associated with the nuclear and/or 
electron spin processes inside the varying 
high- voltage environment of the neural 
membranes and proteins which likely 
enable the said spin processes to be 
proactive, that is, being able to utilize 
non-local energy (potential) and quantum 
information to influence brain activities 
through spin chemistry and possibly 
other chemical and/or physical processes 
in defiance of the second law of 
thermodynamics (Id). 
 
With respect to possible evidence, 
we pointed out that: (1) our own 
experiments 
suggest 
that 
non-local 
energy/potential 
and 
quantum 
information may influence brain function 
through quantum entanglement mediated 
processes (Hu & Wu, 2006a-d; 2007a); 
(2) the well-known placebo effect clearly 
indicates the influence of the mind over 
body; (3) many experimental reports in 
parapsychology indicate the plausibility 
of mind’s influences over brain or matter 
(e.g., Jahn & Dunn, 2005; Tiller, 2007; 
Graham, 2006; Radin, 2006); and (4) in 
the field of alternative energy research, 
there are numerous papers reporting 
excess heat being produced through 
electrophoreses 
and 
various 
plasma 
discharge schemes the common feature 
of which is that somehow under the 
influence of electric fields or high 
electric 
voltages, 
excess 
heat 
was 
claimed to be produced from the vacuum 
or age-old ether (e.g., Graneau & 
Graneau, 1983; Correa & Correa, 2004). 
 
Here we suggest possible additional 
mechanisms besides what our own 
experiments have shown. One such 
possible 
additional 
mechanism 
is 
connected to the Dirac-Hestenes electric 
dipole associated with nuclear/electronic 
spin. As Rivas (2005) pointed out that 
what 
is 
lacking 
in 
the 
quantum 
mechanical wave equation is possibly the 
oscillating electric dipole which in high 
intensity fields or in intergranular areas 
should 
not 
be 
negligible 
in 
its 
contributions to dynamics of the Dirac 
particle. 

 
90
The 
complication 
is 
that 
the 
appearance of an imaginary dipole 
energy term Hint= (–id.E) in the 
Hamiltonian makes it non-hermitian and 
the 
corresponding 
energy 
spectrum 
complex-valued instead of real valued. 
However, various studies of the non-
hermitian Hamiltotians indicate that not 
only very interesting novel dynamics 
appear due to non-hermiticity (See, e.g., 
Aguiar Pinto et al, 2003) but also certain 
classes of non-hermitian Hamiltonians 
still have real energy spectra (See, e.g., 
Bender, 2007). We propose (Proposition 
III) that these new dynamics may be just 
what are needed to enable the proactive 
spin process. 
 
 
Another possible mechanism is 
the Dirac negative energy extraction in a 
varying electric field which has been 
shown to be theoretically possible by 
Solomon (e.g., Solomon, 2006 & 2007). 
The vacuum electrons obey the Dirac 
equation and the energy of these 
electrons will change in response to an 
applied electric field (Id.). Solomon has 
examined the vacuum in Dirac’s hole 
theory and he showed that it is possible 
to find a varying electric field for which 
the change in the energy of each vacuum 
electron is negative (Id.). Therefore, 
according to Solomon, the total change 
in the energy of the vacuum state is 
negative and this new state will have less 
energy than the original unperturbed 
vacuum state (id). 
 
 
Solomon’s 
theoretical 
results 
provide support to the claims of excess 
heat 
being 
produced 
through 
electrophoreses 
and 
various 
plasma 
discharge schemes (e.g., Graneau & 
Graneau, 1983; Correa & Correa, 2004). 
We suspect that the Dirac negative 
energy extraction process shown by 
Solomon is connected to the dynamics of 
the Dirac-Hestenes electric dipole in a 
varying electric field. Further, we don’t 
think that a vacuum electron in a varying 
electric field can fall into the negative 
energy state occupied by the un-
manifested antiparticle. 
 
 
Instead, we propose (Proposition 
IV) that in certain varying external 
electric field the vacuum electron pumps 
energy from the vacuum and release the 
same in our spacetime in order to 
maintain its minimal energy state in the 
vacuum. We will discuss where the 
vacuum energy comes from in a separate 
paper. 
 
 
We further propose (Proposition 
V) that these output processes modulate 
the action potentials, thus influencing the 
brain, by affecting the cross-membrane 
electric voltages and currents directly 
and/or indirectly through changing the 
capacitance, conductance and/or battery 
in the Hudgkin-Huxley model. 
5. Conclusion 
Electric spin effects are effects of electric 
fields on the dynamics of nuclear and /or 
electronic spins and related phenomena. 
In this paper, we have explored several 
such effects and their possible roles in 
the mind-brain interactions within the 
framework 
of 
spin 
mediated 
consciousness theory. We have outlined 
five propositions. In particulars, we have 
considered a more specific model of 
mind-brain interaction in which these 
effects in the varying high-voltage 
electric fields inside neural membranes 

 
91
and proteins mediate mind-brain input 
and output processes. 
 
 
We have suggested that the input 
processes in said electric fields are 
possibly mediated by Dirac-Hestenes 
electric dipoles (Proposition I) and/or 
spin transverse force/torque (Proposition 
II) both of which are associated with the 
nuclear/electronic spin processes. We 
then suggest that the output processes 
(proactive spin processes) in said electric 
fields possibly also involve Dirac-
Hestenes electric dipole interactions in 
said electric fields (Proposition III) and 
Dirac 
negative 
energy 
extraction 
processes, as shown by Solomon, of 
nuclei/electrons (Proposition IV) besides 
non-local processes driven by quantum 
information. 
We 
have 
proposed 
(Proposition 
V) 
that 
these 
output 
processes modulate the action potentials, 
thus influencing the brain, by affecting 
the cross-membrane electric voltages and 
currents 
directly 
and/or 
indirectly 
through 
changing 
the 
capacitance, 
conductance 
and/or 
battery 
in 
the 
Hudgkin-Huxley model. 
 
 
These propositions are based on 
our own experimental findings, further 
theoretical considerations within the 
framework 
of 
spin-mediated 
cons-
ciousness theory, and studies reported by 
others in the fields of spintronics, high-
energy physics and alternative energy 
research. 
 
 
Finally, we stress again the 
importance of experimental work and 
quantitative   calculations and computer 
simulations in order to verify these 
propositions 
and 
make 
substantial 
progresses. 
We 
have 
done 
some 
preliminary work in these directions. As 
usual, results will be reported, when 
feasible.
