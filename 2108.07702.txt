Abstract
We consider the classical double copy, that relates solutions of biadjoint scalar, gauge and
gravity theories.
Using a recently developed twistor expression of this idea, we use well-
established techniques to show that the multipole moments of arbitrary vacuum type D gravity
ﬁelds are straightforwardly mapped to their counterparts in gauge and biadjoint scalar theory
by the single and zeroth copies. We cross-check our results using previously obtained results for
the Kerr metric. Our results provide further physical intuition of how the double copy operates.

Introduction
There is mounting evidence that our various theories of fundamental physics are more closely con-
nected than previously thought. In this paper, we will focus on a particular correspondence – the
classical double copy – that relates solutions of the ﬁeld equations in (non-)abelian gauge theories
and gravity, as well as in a novel scalar theory with two diﬀerent types of colour charge (biad-
joint scalar ﬁeld theory). Inspired by the original double copy for scattering amplitudes in the
corresponding quantum ﬁeld theories [1,2] (which itself has a string theoretic origin [3]), the ﬁrst
classical double copy to appear was the Kerr-Schild double copy of ref. [4] (see refs. [5–18] for further
developments). An alternative exact double copy procedure is the Weyl double copy of ref. [19] (see
also refs. [14,20–23]). This uses the spinorial rather than tensorial formalism of General Relativity,
and includes the Kerr-Schild double copy as a special case. To date, it constitutes the most general
exact statement of the classical double copy, although other formalisms also oﬀer useful alternative
insights [24–35].
As well as practical applications of this correspondence (see e.g. ref. [36]), there are also important
conceptual issues to address, including understanding the ultimate origin of the classical double

copy itself. To this end, refs. [37,38] recently showed how one can derive both the form and scope
of the Weyl double copy using well-established ideas from twistor theory [39–41] (see refs. [42–44]
for pedagogical reviews of this subject), as well as showing that the Weyl copy is more general than
previously thought. As well as applying new mathematical techniques, another useful method for
extending our understanding of the double copy is to take known physical or mathematical prop-
erties in biadjoint scalar, gauge and gravity theories, and to see how they match up (or otherwise).
Recent examples include properties of solutions at strong coupling [45–48], symmetries [33,49–52],
and geometric / topological information [8,53,54]. Even more simply, the original Kerr-Schild dou-
ble copy of ref. [4] told us that mass and energy map to charge in the gauge theory, which nicely
mirrors the replacement of kinematic by colour information in scattering amplitudes [1,2].
In this paper, we extend these ideas by considering the well-known multipole expansion of classical
solutions. For any given solution, one may deﬁne a series of higher-rank multipole tensors, which
completely characterise the spatial and temporal distribution of charge (energy / momentum) in
the gauge (gravity) theory respectively. The lowest-order results in this expansion constitute the
total charge and mass mentioned above, and one may then ask whether higher-multipole moments
are strict double copies of each other. It turns out that this can be easily addressed in the twistor
picture of refs. [37,38]. As has been argued by Curtis [55], the multipole tensors can be replaced by
multi-index spinor ﬁelds, each of which satisﬁes the twistor equation. As a consequence, one may
instead describe the multipole moments of a given ﬁeld purely in terms of higher-rank twistors,
which are straightforwardly deﬁned from the twistor-space functions describing the ﬁelds.
We
will combine this with the twistor-space double copy of refs. [37, 38], and thus obtain an explicit
statement that the multipole expansion double-copies, for arbitrary type D vacuum solutions. Our
results provide a useful physical insight into how the double copy operates, and may well be relevant
for thinking about further applications.

The twistor space double copy
In this section, we review salient details of the Weyl double copy, together with its twistor space
incarnation, referring the reader to refs. [37,38] for full details. First, we recall that massless free
spacetime ﬁelds can be represented by multi-index spinors φAB...C (¯φA′B′...C′), representing the
anti-self-dual (self-dual) parts of the ﬁeld respectively. Index values run from 0 to 1, and may be
raised, lowered and / or contracted using the Levi-Civita symbols ϵAB etc. There are 2n indices for
a spin-n ﬁeld, and the resulting quantities then satisfy a special case of the general massless free
ﬁeld equation
∇AA′ ¯φA′...C′ = 0,
∇AA′φAB...C = 0,
(1)
where ∇AA′ is the appropriate translation of the spacetime covariant derivative. These ﬁelds can
be reinterpreted in twistor space T, corresponding to solutions of the twistor equation
∇(A
A′ΩB) = 0
⇒
ΩA = ωA −ixAA′πA′.
(2)
In the second equality we have written the general solution in Minkowski space, in terms of constant
spinors which may be grouped together to make a 4-component twistor
Zα = (ωA, πA′).
(3)
2

A non-local map between spacetime and twistor space is established by requiring that the ﬁeld in
eq. (2) vanish, such that the twistor components satisfy the incidence relation
ωA = ixAA′πA′.
(4)
This is invariant under rescalings Zα →λZα, λ ∈C, such that we need only consider projective
twistor space PT. A point in spacetime corresponds to a Riemann sphere in PT, also referred to
as a (complex) line. An important result known as the Penrose transform expresses massless free
spacetime ﬁelds satisfying eq. (1) via the contour integrals
¯φA′B′...C′(x) =
1
2πi
I
Γ
dπE′dπE′πA′πB′ . . . πC′[ρxf(Zα)],
(5)
where ρx restricts all twistors to obey the incidence relation corresponding to spacetime point x,
and the contour Γ lies on the appropriate Riemann sphere. The combined integrand and measure
must be invariant under rescalings Zα →λZα, which ﬁxes the (holomorphic) function f(Zα) to
have homogeneity −(n + 2) for a spin-n ﬁeld. The above remarks imply that twistor functions of
homogeneity −2, −4 and −6 correspond to spacetime gravity ﬁelds in scalar, gauge and gravity
theory respectively. Denoting the respective twistor functions by the subscripts {scal., EM, grav.}
respectively, refs. [37,38] argued that one may deﬁne a gravity twistor function via4
fgrav.(Zα) = f(1)
EM(Zα)f(2)
EM(Zα)

leading to the spacetime Weyl double copy formula

C′D′)(x)

(7)
ﬁrst presented in ref. [19].
Here φ is a biadjoint scalar ﬁeld, φ(i)
A′B′ an electromagnetic spinor,
and φA′B′C′D a Weyl spinor. The above discussion applies to the case of primed spinor ﬁelds in
spacetime. For unprimed ﬁelds, one may consider the conjugate of eq. (2), whose solutions are
associated with dual twistors Wα. The notion of the Penrose transform can be straightforwardly
adapted from eq. (8):
φAB...C(x) =
1
2πi
I
Γ
dλEdλEλAλB . . . λC[ρxf(Wα)],
(8)
and the twistor double copy of eq. (6) similarly generalises. We will work with dual twistors by
default in what follows, in order to match conventions with ref. [55].

Multipoles and the double copy
The idea of multipoles is familiar from Newtonian physics in three-dimensional Euclidean space. A
stationary electrostatic or Newtonian potential φ in a sourceless region satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
4We have here skimmed over the fact that the twistor functions used throughout are not unique, and are instead
representatives of cohomology classes. The product of eq. (6) is then interpreted to apply only to particular chosen
representatives, as discussed in detail in ref. [38].

(9)
where r = (xixi)

2 , and the multipole tensors {Mij...k} are constant tensors deﬁned in terms of
derivatives of the potential, evaluated at the origin O.
Upon shifting to a diﬀerent point, the
multipole moments change in a way that involves only lower-order multipoles. The extension of
these ideas to General Relativity has been discussed in refs. [56–58], for general asymptotically ﬂat
spacetimes. We will not need the full complication of the latter, given that we will be concerned
with solutions of the massless free ﬁeld equation of eq. (1) in Minkowski space. Given a constant
unit timelike vector ta, one may then consider the 3-space orthogonal to this, with induced metric
hab = ηab −tatb.
(10)
Reference [56] then showed that an appropriate generalisation of the multipole tensors appearing
in eq. (9) is provided by symmetric, trace-free tensor ﬁelds Qa1...an(x) satisfying
ta1Qa1...an = 0,
∇mQa1...an = n(2n −1)
3
hm(a1Qa2...an) −n(n −1)
3
Qm(a3...anha1a2),
(11)
where the nth such quantity is referred to as the 2n-multipole tensor, and the second condition
requires that the derivatives of multipole tensors depend only upon lower multipoles. This is the
analogue of the “shifting the origin” property mentioned for Newtonian multipoles above, and en-
sures that the set of tensors {Qa1...an} corresponds to the same solution of the ﬁeld equation.
In the spinorial formalism, each spacetime index in eq. (11) will become a pair of spinor indices.
Contracting with the timelike vector appearing there, one may deﬁne the symmetric spinor ﬁeld

which turns out to solve a higher-rank generalisation of the twistor equation of eq. (2):
∇(L′
L ωA′
1...A′
2n) = 0.
(13)
Thus, we can associate the spinors of eq. (12) with multi-index multipole twistors {Qα1...α2n}. To
see how this works in practice, consider a given physical spin-n ﬁeld ΨA1A2...A2n. Then one may
deﬁne higher-spin ﬁelds iteratively by taking derivatives and contracting with the timelike vector
appearing in eq. (12):
Ψ(n)
A1...A2n = tA′A1∇A′
A2[Ψ(n−1)
A3...A2n].
(14)
These constitute a spinorial analogue of the multiple derivatives appearing in the Newtonian for-
malism of eq. (14), whereby higher multipole moments contain more derivatives of the original
potential. For a spin-1 ﬁeld, one may write an explicit twistor space integral for the total conserved
charge producing the ﬁeld [59]:
Q = −i
4π2
I
f(Wα)d4W,
d4W = 1
4!ϵαβγδdWα dWβ dWγ dWδ,
(15)
5Throughout the paper we use lower-case Latin, upper-case Latin and Greek indices for spacetime tensors, space-
time spinors and twistors respectively. Note, however, that the indices in eq. (9) run only over spatial components
i.e. from 1 to 3.

where an appropriate contour must be chosen, and where f(Wα) is the twistor function correspond-
ing to the spacetime ﬁeld. Given a higher-spin ﬁeld as in eq. (14), we can form multiple spin-1
ﬁelds by contracting with solutions of the twistor equation6 {αA1...A2n}:
Φ(n)
AB = −inαA1...A2n[Ψ(n+1)
ABA1...A2n].
(16)
Each of these ﬁelds will have a conserved charge according to eq. (15), and we may collect together
all such charges in the twistor-covariant form
q(Aα1...α2n) = in+1
4π2
I
Wα1 . . . Wα2nAα1...α2nfn+1(Wα)d4W,
(17)
for symmetric twistors {Aα1...α2n}, where fn+1(Wα) is the twistor function corresponding to the
spacetime higher-spin ﬁeld (n+1)ΨABA1...A2n, and multipole index n. Equation (17) deﬁnes a set of
quantities dual to the {Aα1...α2n}:
Qα1...α2n = in+1
4π2
I
Wα1 . . . Wα2nfn+1(Wα)d4W,
(18)
which are the multipole twistors we have been seeking. Note that the iterative structure of the
higher-spin ﬁelds in eq. (14) implies that the twistor functions {fn+1} in eq. (18) can also be
constructed iteratively, and there are various ways that this can be written.
A fully invariant
condition is [55]

(20)
Rα is an arbitrary twistor, and we have introduced the projector [55]
λP α
β = IαγQγβ,
(21)
where λ is the relevant mass or charge parameter for a given theory. One thus has λ = m in gravity,
where m is the total mass of the system. In gauge or biadjoint theory, it will be the total charge of
the system that is creating the ﬁeld, which we will denote by q and y respectively.
3.1
The double copy of the multipole expansion
The multipole twistors introduced above allow us to address the double copy of the multipole
expansion in a particularly compact and elegant way. Consider twistor functions corresponding to
a biadjoint scalar, electromagnetic and gravity solution respectively, which we label by fX(Wα),
X ∈{scal., EM, grav.}. From each of these, one may deﬁne a set of higher-spin twistor functions
according to the iterative procedure of eq. (19), denoted here by f(n)
X (Wα).
By eq. (18), this
immediately leads to a set of multipole twistors for each original spacetime ﬁeld. This construction
is shown in table 1, where each column contains twistor functions of the same homogeneity, leading
6That the ﬁelds of eq. (16) indeed satisfy the massless free ﬁeld equation of eq. (1) follows from eq. (13).

Note that a gravitational monopole contribution is not directly obtained from the

For the n = 1 case, one ﬁnds integrals expressing the total charge
generated by the biadjoint or EM ﬁeld. From n = 2 upwards, there are multipole twistors in all
three theories. For a given set of functions {fX} related by the twistor-space double copy, we can
then associate each column of table 2 with a classical double copy triple, as shown in ﬁgure 1.
The physical interpretation of the identiﬁcations in ﬁgure 1 is straightforward. Consider, for exam-
ple, the 2-multipole tensors QX
αβ. This represents the angular momentum in gravity [40], whereas
in electromagnetism it is the charge dipole tensor, as expected given that the single copy turns
mass into charge. Likewise, for the higher multipoles, the single copy replaces the relevant spa-
tiotemporal distribution of mass / momentum with that of charge, with a further replacement to
“biadjoint charge” in the zeroth copy.

It is one thing to formally identify the multipole twistors in diﬀerent theories, as we have done in
ﬁgure 1. It is quite another thing to say that the multipole twistors in the diﬀerent theories are
the same, up to simple mass and charge replacements. Remarkably, this strong statement indeed
turns out to be true for ﬁelds related by the original type D Weyl double copy of ref. [19], as we
discuss in the following section.
3.2
Multipole moments of type D solutions
As discussed in ref. [60] and reviewed in refs. [37,38], all vacuum type D solutions arise from twistor
functions of the form
fgrav. = (AαβWαWβ)−3,
(22)
where Aαβ is a constant twistor that can be taken to be symmetric. We see that eq. (22) has
homogeneity −6 under rescalings of Wα, as required for a gravity solution. Furthermore, it has
two poles in twistor space, which give rise, after performing the Penrose transform of eq. (8) to
position space, to the two two-fold degenerate principal spinors of the Weyl spinor that characterise
it as being of type D. It turns out that the twistor Aαβ can be straightforwardly related to the
2-multipole twistor for this ﬁeld. Substituting eq. (22) into eq. (18) for n = 1, one may carry out
the integral using a special case of
I
Wα1 . . . Wα2n(WαWβAαβ))−(n+2)d4W = π3i
∆
(2n)!
22n−1(n + 1)!n!B(α1α2 . . . Bα2n−1α2n),
(23)
where Bαβ is the inverse of Aαβ, and ∆the determinant of the latter. One ﬁnds
Qαβ =
π
8i∆Bαβ,
Qαβ = 8i∆
π Aαβ.
(24)
Given the general type D gravity twistor function of eq. (22), one may also identify the single
and zeroth copies, giving rise to a gauge and biadjoint scalar ﬁeld in spacetime respectively. As
explained in refs. [37,38], these are
fscal. = N0(AαβWαWβ)−1,
fEM = N1(AαβWαWβ)−2.
(25)
We have here included arbitrary constant normalisation factors in the scalar and electromagnetic
functions, which are in any case not ﬁxed in the Weyl double copy of ref. [19]. Physically, one
may absorb such constants by redeﬁning the total amount of charge in a particular solution, but
we will ﬁx them shortly. Let us now construct and compare the multipole twistors from these
solutions. For each ﬁeld, we may construct higher-spin twistor functions using the procedure of
eq. (19). Starting with the gravity function from eq. (22), one ﬁnds
f(3)
grav. = −3i
α (RαWβIαβ)−1(AρλWρWλ)−4RγIγτQτδAδσWσ,
(26)
where we have used eq. (21). We may now use eq. (24), which yields
f(3)
grav. = 3

as quoted in ref. [55]. Note that placing n = 2 in this formula reproduces the original gravity
twistor function fgrav.(Wα) itself. We may ﬁnd the multipole twistors of eq. (18) using eq. (23, 24),
yielding

(2m)n−1
(2n)!
n! Qgrav.
(α1α2 . . . Qgrav.

(29)
In principle, one may convert these multipole twistors back into multipole tensors. For the Kerr
solution, a set of scalar multipole moments has been deﬁned in the literature [58]. Let ˜za be a vector
aligned with the axis of rotation of the black hole, and Λ be the point at inﬁnity after conformal
compactiﬁcation of the spacetime. Then the multipole moments are given by
Qn = 1
n!Qa1...an ˜za1 . . . zan

Λ,
(30)
where the notation on the right-hand side denotes that this be evaluated at Λ itself. As stated in
ref. [55], the multipole twistors of eq. (29) do indeed reproduce the known multipole moments of
the Kerr solution, ﬁrst found in ref. [58].
We may carry out the above procedure for the biadjoint scalar and gauge theory twistor functions
of eq. (25), and the resulting higher spin twistor functions are given by

where we have replaced the mass m in the gravity solution with the charge q in gauge theory, and
biadjoint charge y in the scalar theory. These functions reproduce the original ﬁelds for n = 0 and
n = 1 respectively. We may choose to ﬁx the arbitrary normalisation constants Ni by requiring
that the 2-multipole (dipole) tensor in each theory is simply related by replacing
m →q →y.

in going from gravity to gauge theory, to biadjoint theory. This determines

after which comparison of eq. (31) with eq. (28) shows that all higher-spin twistor functions agree
across all three theories, so that one may simply replace the multipole twistors of eq. (29) with the
gauge and biadjoint scalar counterparts

As a direct consequence, the multipole moments of the gauge and biadjoint scalar ﬁelds correspond-
ing to a given gravity ﬁeld from eq. (22) precisely match, after making the necessary mass-to-charge
8

replacements. Our twistor analysis has applied for an arbitrary quadratic form in eq. (22) which,
as explained in refs. [37, 38], is a general statement for any (vacuum type D) spacetime entering
the original Weyl double copy of ref. [19]. In particular, this must apply to the Kerr solution, and
there is a novel cross-check one may perform. The gauge theory counterpart of this solution is the
√
Kerr solution discussed above, and its electromagnetic monopole moments have not previously
been calculated directly. However, one may instead consider a charged Kerr black hole, otherwise
known as a Kerr-Newman black hole [61,62]. This is a solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations,
and as such consists of a metric plus a gauge ﬁeld. The
√
Kerr solution can be obtained by setting
the mass of the solution to zero, leaving a gauge ﬁeld living in Minkowski space, and which is
known to correspond to the single copy of the gravity solution. The combined gravitational and
electromagnetic multipole moments of the Kerr-Newman solution have been calculated in ref. [63].
The gravity moments agree with the pure Kerr solution, and the electromagnetic ones are simply
obtained by the mass-to-charge replacement of eq. (32). This indeed veriﬁes our results. Further
support comes from recent studies showing that the multipole expansion for
√
Kerr and Kerr can
be obtained from scattering amplitudes that manifestly double-copy [64].

Discussion
In this paper, we have considered whether the multipole expansions of ﬁelds in biadjoint scalar,
gauge and gravity theory can be related by the classical double copy. By combining a twistor
formulation of the multipole expansion [55] with a recently developed twistor language for the clas-
sical double copy [37,38], we have shown that the multipole moments for arbitrary type D vacuum
solutions indeed match up in diﬀerent theories, subject to appropriate mass / charge replacements.
Our results provide a nice illustration of the eﬃciency of the twistor double copy, but are of interest
in their own right. It is often the case that a single copy of a given gravity solution can be found,
but not easily interpreted. A canonical case of this is the single copy of the Kerr black hole, ﬁrst
formally identiﬁed in ref. [4], and denoted as
√
Kerr in subsequent literature (see e.g. refs. [64–66]).
It is known that this solution occurs by replacing the source for the Kerr black hole (a rotating disk
of mass) with a similar gauge theory source (a rotating disk of charge). However, the nature of the
sources is subtly diﬀerent in the two theories [4], such that it is not clear what impact this has on
the ﬁelds themselves. Multipole moments, however, allow us to fully characterise the structure of
ﬁelds in a gauge-invariant way. Thus, the fact that the multipole moments for the Kerr and
√
Kerr
solutions are essentially identical tells us a great deal of information about how to physically inter-
pret the single copy, by recycling our intuition gathered from the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, the
fact that our results apply for any type D vacuum solution makes this a rather powerful statement,
that may well help in interpreting and extending the double copy in future.
Another nice aspect of our results is that the multipole expansion in biadjoint theory also matches
that in the gauge and gravity theories, for the wide class of solutions we have considered. This
adds a powerful weight to the observations made in refs. [37, 38], namely that the twistor double
copy allows us to understand the inverse zeroth copy from biadjoint scalar theory to gauge theory.
That is, we have seen directly that the multipoles of vacuum type D gravity solutions and their
single copies are essentially inherited directly from a much simpler scalar theory! It is interesting
to ponder what other physical quantities can be phrased in such an appealing manner.
