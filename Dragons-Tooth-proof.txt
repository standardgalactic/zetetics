ABOUT THE AUTHOR

 W
riting about mountain routes 
that are not on the radar of 
the majority of winter 
enthusiasts is an unresolved 
paradox for me. On the one 
hand I want to share the wonderful 
experience that the route has given me with 
others, but on the other hand I don’t want to 
tell anyone about it because I may be 
contributing to the overdevelopment of the 
route and ultimately destroying the 
experience for others. It is easier to justify 
writing about a less well-known route when it is 
already in the guidebook to the area, it has 
been covered in selected climbs books, and it is 
therefore in the public domain. I hope that 
hundreds of you will tell me that you know all 
about this route, but I don’t often see lots of 
people on this little gem of a mountain. The low 
numbers may be due to the fact that the start is 
at a low altitude, close to Loch Leven, which 
means that it doesn’t come into winter 
condition on a regular basis.
This month’s Great British Day Out is 
located at the bottom of one of the most 
spectacular and beautiful places in Scotland 
– the Glencoe valley. A 12km long valley 
named after the River Coe that runs through 
it. The river’s name predates the Gaelic 
language, but it possibly stems from a 
personal name – Comhan.  The valley is 
overlooked on both sides by steep and wild- 
looking mountains. The south side is marked 
by a succession of majestic peaks separated 
by deep cwms: Buachaille Etive Mòr at its 
entrance is followed by Buachaille Etive Beag, 
the Three Sisters and finally the shoulders of 
the Bidean nam Bian massif marking the 
western end of the valley. By contrast the north 
side is overlooked by a wall of mountains, the 
ridge along its summits forms the famous grade 
2 mountain route – the Aonach Eagach 
traverse. The grandeur of the Glencoe  valley 
has also been immortalised in films such as 
‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’, ‘Harry 
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban’ and 
recently the James Bond film ‘Skyfall’.
THE DRAGON’S TOOTH
Anyone who has crossed Loch Leven from 
Onich en route to Glencoe no doubt will have 
looked up and seen the route I am about to 
describe and possibly, just like I did years 
before I climbed it, will say, “I wonder what 
that mountain is? Let’s go and have a look at  
it one day.” 
Beyond the village of Glencoe and just above 
Loch Leven and South Ballchulish is a 
wonderful peak called Sgorr Dhonuill that rises 
out of the forests from the head of Gleann a’ 
Chaolais. In front of the peak, two spurs run 
northwards; the eastern, most jagged and 
narrow one, with a jutting pinnacle at the start 
of the ridge, is Sgorr a’ Chaolais or the 
Dragon’s Tooth. An ascent of the ridge in 
winter conditions, followed by Sgorr Dhonuill 
has been a favourite of mine for a number 
of years.

Great British Days Out
The Dragon’s Tooth is of modest height, 
but it stands clear from all the surrounding 
terrain. It gets its name from the dragon of 
legend that is said to have inhabited the high 
corries. It is a grade 2 scramble in summer, 
depending on the exact route taken, and is 
also a grade 2 route in winter. It has some 
narrow ridge walking/scrambling and an 
obligatory abseil. For the full winter 
experience, it should only be tackled when 
there is good snow cover down to tree level 
(about 400m). This is not only for aesthetic 
reasons, but because the deep snow protects 
the delicate plant life low down on the route.
We were very fortunate on the day we first 
ascended it because we were actually heading 
for the top of Glencoe valley to explore the 
mountains behind the Glencoe ski resort  
when a lorry shed its load and we had to turn 
round. We headed for the mountain we had 
always looked up at, but ignored – the 
Dragon’s Tooth. 
It is not too difficult to find. There is a public 
car park half a mile off the road just above 
South Ballachulish (see The Knowledge). The 
right hand fork of the forest road is gated and 
sometimes locked, but there is limited parking 
higher up the left hand fork. After parking, the 
approach route follows the road gently uphill 
along Gleann a’ Chaolais, perhaps the most 
picturesque of the valleys hereabouts, to reach 
the base of the large slopes that form the 
bottom of the ridge.
Once you leave the road you pass through 
thinning and fallen trees and lots of tussocks, 
heading for the left hand side of the initial 
steep slopes. The going can get a bit tough here 
when the snow cover is not deep enough to 
support one’s weight. On the left (east facing) 
side of the mountain, at about 600m, there are 
a number of opportunities for ascending onto 
the ridge. There is a grade 2 climb, a grade 1 
gully or further up, and leading more directly 
onto the Dragon’s Tooth, there are some trickier 
grade 3 and 4 climbs. 
RIDGE RAIDERS
We chose to ascend the ‘blocky’ yet narrow 
grade 2 ridge and in three challenging (or 
should that read ‘crampon scraping’) pitches 
reached the easier slopes that lead to the start 
of the ridge proper. The views looking 
northwards from this initial false summit are 
stupendous. Loch Leven and Onich are in the 
foreground and in the distance Aonach Mor 
and Ben Nevis stand proud.
We removed the rope for the easier ground 
to make travel faster, but as the ridge narrowed, 
we tied back in and took chest coils to shorten 
the length between us to about 8m. We then 
moved together weaving in and out of the 
boulders and the jagged sections of rock. As 
the ridge became narrower and the exposure 
increased, we placed slings over large spikes of 
rock to protect our progress and kept moving 
together. It is this process of ‘moving together’ 
that separates the experienced from the 
inexperienced mountaineer. It requires

 CHARACTER AND 
CONDITIONS
The  route requires good snow 
cover low down to make it a 
perfect winter day out, and care 
is needed in strong winds. On top 
of the usual skills of winter 
walking, such as navigation and 
avalanche awareness, the route 
requires experience of grade 2 
winter climbing and the ability to 
abseil and move together safely 
on easy, but technical terrain.
 EQUIPMENT
40L rucksack, winter boots that 
can take crampons, warm 
trousers, three layers, small duvet 
jacket or extra fleece, balaclava 
or fleece hat, waterproof jacket

good judgement from all the participants who 
must consider the consequences should any 
of the party slip. 
Eventually the ridge reaches the top of the 
Dragon’s Tooth proper and a steep 15m drop 
bars the way on. There are a number of 
options available, but if you start to descend 
(unlikely looking) on the right (west facing) 
side of the ridge there is a large in-situ rope 
thread for abseiling from. After we had 
completed the abseil, we crossed the narrow 
crest of the saddle that lies between the 
summit and the rest of the ridge.
From here the ridge is magnificent and 
remains exposed right to the top, but the 
terrain is well suited to moving together. The 
views to the cwms either side give it a dramatic 
feel. The Dragon’s Tooth ridge eventually joins 
the ridge that leads to the summit of Sgorr 
Dhonuill. At this point, we took the rope off 
again and walked up the easy ridge to the 
summit; however, if it is windy it may be 
prudent to keep the rope on just for the last 
10m when there is a very big drop to the right. 
It is also a good idea to stay away from the 
ridge edge as large cornices can build up when 
the wind is in the right direction. 
The summit is a wonderful place and 
provides a 360 degree panorama. From here 
the ridge is magnificent and remains exposed 
right to the top, but the terrain is well suited to 
moving together. The views to the cwms either 
side give it a dramatic feel. The Dragon’s Tooth 
ridge eventually joins the ridge that leads to the 
summit of Sgorr Dhonuill. At this point, we took 
the rope off again and walked up the easy ridge 
to the summit; however, if it is windy it may be

10m when there is a very big drop to the right. 
It is also a good idea to stay away from the 
ridge edge as large cornices can build up when 
the wind is in the right direction. 
We finally descended eastwards to the col 
that separates Sgorr Dhonuill from the 
slightly higher Stob Dhearg, which would 
make a wonderful continuation for those with 
more energy to expend. It is also possible to 
do a circuit and descend the sister north- 
facing ridge, but as it is a very boulder strewn 
descent it is only recommended when there is 
good snow cover because in unconsolidated 
snow it is a pain. It is also possible to descend 
eastwards to the col before point 824m and 
descend back down to the forest. A brilliant 
continuation for those looking for a major day 
out would be to complete the circuit further 
eastwards to point 759m and the follow the 
undulating ridge to point 758m.
However, from the col we descended 
northwards into Gleann a’ Chaolais. It does 
require a little care when the avalanche risk is 
high, but you soon reach safe slopes and the 
walk back to the car.
The lorry shedding its load had led to the 
serendipitous event of us discovering a route 
that we both fell in love with. I have 
subsequently climbed the Dragons Tooth with 
peers just because I love it and with clients
