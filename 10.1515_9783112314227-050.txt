PERCOLATION PROBLEM FOR THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING MODEL

Let us consider the ferromagnetic nearest neighbour Ising model 
in two dimension. 
Our main interest is to investigate percolation 
properties of the unique Gibbs state for parameters g < g^, and real 
h ( magnetic field ). 
Formally, the Hamiltonian of our system is 
given by 
H (a) = - 
I a (x) a (y ) - h I a(x) , 
<x,y> 
x 
2 
where <x,y> denotes the nearest neighbour pair {x,y} in 7L . 
For a 
given pair of parameters (B,h), there exists a unique Gibbs state 
y 
, which is formally of the form 
p, h 
Ua , (a) = N-1exp{ - BH(a)} , 
p i n 
where N is the normalization factor. 
We investigate percolation 
property of this Gibbs state, namely we are looking at the asymptotic 
behavior of the following probability as k + 
the origin is +connected to the boundary of the 
* °° = V h

cube Q = Ix^ZZ -, |x |,|x |Sk } 
The decay of this probability changes according to the convergence 
i -* i 
or divergence of the expected size of the dual cluster; E(| wQ 
] ) , 
where W^ is the -*cluster of the origin. 
To state our result, we 
need some notations. 
The *connection in 7Z? allows the diagonal 
2 
connection in addition to the usual connection in K ; x and y are 
•nearest neighbours when |x*-y*| and 
are both 0 or 1. 
W*

is the connected component of the origin 0, in a 
( + 1) = (xiffi ; 
_ +* _* 
a(x) = +1 }, ( this is called by the +cluster of 0 ). 
W Q, WQ , W Q 
are defined in the same way. 
For technical reason we have to con-

sider the clusters in the half space 7L = { x t Z ; x 6 0 } , which 
~ ±

we denote by W^, and W^ . 
Another probability we are looking at is

so-called the sponge percolation probability,-

S 
= p 
m,n 
( {x'' = - m } is +connected to { x* = m } in the 1 
i ,h [ rectangle [-m,m] x j^-n,n]

The main result we get is the following: 
Theorem 1. 
If for the given parameter (g,h), the Gibbs state 
is unique, say y^ 
then the following statements are equivalent.

li3|h( 1 wo I = - ) > 0.

n ->• <*> 
{ U i ) 
EB,h( IW0* I > < 
{iv) 
it (k) S exp {- ak/(logk) } as K + » for some constant 
a > 0. 
This is a weak version of the results of Russo[3], Seymour and 
Welsh[4). 
In their results, it is not necessary to restrict to the 
+cluster in the half space in (i),but they obtained the equivalence 
of (i) ^ (iii) for the whole space cluster W* in (i), in the case 
where the basic probability measure is a Bernoulli measure. 
This, 
is also possible in our case when we restrict parameters: 
Theorem 2. 
If B £ Bc and. h = 0, then the followings are equiva-
lent.

for some a > 0. 
The proof of these theorems are given in [2]. 
Remark. M. Aizenman showed the way to obtain real exponential 
decay in (iv) in Theorem 2, by private communication.
