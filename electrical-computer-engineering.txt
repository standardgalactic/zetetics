The Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department provides high-
quality degree programs that emphasize fundamental principles, respond
to the changing demands and opportunities of new technology, challenge
the exceptional abilities of Rice students, and prepare students for roles
of leadership in their chosen careers.
The department's seven current research areas can be grouped into
four undergraduate educational specializations including: Computer
Engineering; Data Science/Systems; Neuroengineering; and Photonics,
Electronics, and Nano-devices.
• Computer Engineering topics include: computer architecture,
high performance application speciﬁc systems, mobile and
embedded systems, integrated circuits and antennas for
medical imaging and bio-sensing, and parallel I/O for large-scale
network storage systems.
• Data Science/Systems topics include: data acquisition, data
analytics, data storage, and computing infrastructure, wireless
systems, computer vision, dynamical systems and computation,
networks, signal and image processing, wireless networking,
pattern recognition, and scalable personal digital health. 
• Neuroengineering topics include: neural signal processing,
brain-computer interfaces at the device, circuit, and systems
levels, and computational neuroscience.
• Photonics, Electronics, and Nano-devices topics include:
quantum engineering, nanophotonics/nanospectroscopy,
molecular electronics, biophotonics, ultrafast optics and
optoelectronics, materials for energy, semiconductor optics
and devices, multispectral imaging and terahertz imaging, and
condensed matter physics/materials science.
The Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers two
undergraduate degree programs. The Bachelor of Science in Electrical
and Computer Engineering (BSECE) degree program is comprehensive
and covers fundamental and emerging hardware and software
topics. Courses, research, and design projects grouped in four areas of
educational specialization prepare students for technical leadership
in engineering, computing, and science careers. The ECE department
also offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree with a major in Electrical and
Computer Engineering.
The Electrical and Computer Engineering department offers two graduate
degree programs. The Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering
(MECE) degree is a course-based program designed to increase a
student’s mastery of advanced subjects; no thesis is required. For
the MECE degree, the research areas are currently presented as six
educational specializations with the addition of computer vision and
quantum engineering to provide additional focus on emerging topics.
The MECE prepares a student to succeed and advance rapidly in today’s
competitive technical marketplace.
The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree program prepares students for
a research career in academia or industry. The PhD degree program
consists of formal courses and original research conducted under the
guidance of a faculty advisor, leading to a thesis. Students in the PhD
program either complete a Master of Science (MS) degree as part of their
program or have already completed a MS degree at another institution
before enrolling in the PhD program. While students are not routinely
admitted speciﬁcally to the Electrical and Computer Engineering MS
degree program, the department does occasionally admit students to
pursue the terminal MS degree.

than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a
broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality
of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two
fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the
center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2)
Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are
randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Graduate/Undergraduate

Description: In many applications one is faced with the task of simulating
or controlling complex dynamical systems. Such applications include
for instance, weather prediction, air quality management, VLSI chip
design, molecular dynamics, active noise reduction, chemical reactors,
etc. In all these cases complexity manifests itself as the number of ﬁrst
order differential equations which arise. Model (order) reduction (MOR)
seeks to replace a large-scale system described in terms of differential
or difference equations by a system of much lower dimension that has
nearly the same response characteristics. The ensuing methods have
been an indispensable tool for speeding up the simulations arising
in various engineering applications involving large-scale dynamical
systems. In this course we will develop the underlying approximation
theory paying particular attention to its data-driven aspects. Additional

Short Title: ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING
Department: Electrical & Computer Eng.
Grade Mode: Standard Letter
Course Type: Lecture
Credit Hours: 3
Restrictions: Enrollment is limited to Graduate level students.
Course Level: Graduate
Description: There is a long history of algorithmic development for
solving inferential and estimation problems that play a central role
in a variety of learning, sensing, and processing systems, including
medical imaging scanners, numerous machine learning algorithms,
and compressive sensing, to name just a few. Until recently, most
algorithms for solving inferential and estimation problems have iteratively
applied static models derived from physics or intuition. In this course,
we will explore a new approach that is based on “learning” various
elements of the problem including i) stepsizes and parameters of iterative
algorithms, ii) regularizers, and iii) inverse functions. For example, we will
explore a new approach for solving inverse problems that is based on
transforming an iterative, physics-based algorithm into a deep network
whose parameters can be learned from training data. For a range of
different inverse problems, deep networks have been shown to offer
faster convergence to a better quality solution. Speciﬁc topics to be
discussed include: Ill-posed inverse problems, iterative optimization,
deep learning, neural networks, learning regularizers. This is a “reading
course,” meaning that students will read and present classic and recent
papers from the technical literature to the rest of the class in a lively
debate format. Discussions will aim at identifying common themes and
important trends in the ﬁeld. Students will also get hands on experience
with optimization problems and deep learning software through a group

Course Level: Graduate
Description: This is a graduate seminar course on quantum information
science and technology. There is currently a world-wide effort to
develop technologies based on the principles of quantum mechanics
that are expected to revolutionize computation, communication, and
sensing. These rapid scientiﬁc and technological developments can
be viewed as the second quantum revolution. Unlike the ﬁrst quantum
revolution, which occurred during the ﬁrst few decades of the 20th
century and totally changed the way we describe the universe, the second
quantum revolution is about controlling individual quantum systems
to a much greater extent than before, enabling even more powerful
applications of quantum mechanics. Many of these new applications rely
on genuinely quantum, nonintuitive concepts such as superposition and
entanglement. These concepts are becoming more and more common
