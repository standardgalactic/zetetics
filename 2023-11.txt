The presence of incomplete cuts in a thin planar
sheet can dramatically alter its mechanical and
geometrical response to loading, as the cuts allow
the sheet to deform strongly in the third dimension,
most beautifully demonstrated in kirigami art-forms.
We use numerical experiments to characterize the
geometric mechanics of kirigamized sheets as a
function of the number, size and orientation of cuts.
We show that the geometry of mechanically loaded
sheets can be approximated as a composition of
simple developable units: ﬂats, cylinders, cones and
compressed Elasticae. This geometric construction
yields scaling laws for the mechanical response of
the sheet in both the weak and strongly deformed
limit. In the ultimately stretched limit, this further
leads to a theorem on the nature and form of
geodesics in an arbitrary kirigami pattern, consistent
with observations and simulations. Finally, we show
that by varying the shape and size of the geodesic in
a kirigamized sheet, we can control the deployment
trajectory of the sheet, and thence its functional
properties as an exemplar of a tunable structure that
can serve as a robotic gripper, a soft light window or
the basis for a physically unclonable device. Overall
our study of disordered kirigami sets the stage for
controlling the shape and shielding the stresses in thin
sheets using cuts.

1. Introduction
Kirigami, the art of paper cutting to create an articulating single sheet, is now increasingly
viewed as a paradigm for the design of mechanical metamaterials that exhibit exceptional
geometric and structural properties [1–3]. The basis for kirigami is the well-known observation
that the mechanical response of thin sheets is characterized by the scale separation
induced by slender geometries, which makes bending deformations inexpensive compared to
stretching deformations. In kirigami, varying the number, size and location of cuts provides extra
degrees of control via the internal localization of large bending deformations anchored at the
ends of the cuts. This raises a number of questions associated with both the forward problem of
understanding the mechanics of these topologically and geometrically complex materials, as well
as the inverse problem of designing the cuts to obtain different types of articulated deformations
for shape optimization. Recent work in the context of the forward problem has focused primarily
on the mechanics of kirigami with simple distributions of periodic cuts, aimed at characterizing
the response using a combination of theory, experiment and computation [4–6]. By contrast, the
inverse problem of designing cuts that allow for articulated shape transformations has been
limited primarily to geometric optimization [7,8], without much discussion of the mechanical
response of the resulting structures by incorporating bending energies. To design cut patterns to
control the shape and response of kirigamized sheets, we need to combine aspects of both these
classes of problems by understanding the geometric mechanics of sheets with multiple aperiodic
cuts. Here, we take a step in this direction by characterizing the geometry and mechanics of a
single cut subject to deformation, and then generalize our study to kirigami sheets with randomly
located cuts, but staying in the dilute limit where the cuts do not intersect.
2. Geometry and mechanics of a sheet with a single cut
To get a sense of the geometry of deformations in a kirigamized sheet, in ﬁgure 1, we show a
sheet with four parallel cuts that has been strongly stretched, leading to a shape like a kabuki
mask. In ﬁgure 2a, we show the shape of a thin circular sheet of radius R, thickness h and a single
horizontal cut of length l. When the nominal strain γ induced by the applied horizontal force
crosses a threshold, the initially planar sheet buckles out of the plane into a complex geometrical
shape. Casual observations of the sheet show that the deformed sheet is constituted of simple
conical and cylindrical domains connected by transition regions, as expected from thin sheet
mechanics; increasing the topological complexity of the sheet increases the number, size, shape
and orientational order of such domains.
We use experimental observations and numerical simulations to study the geometrical
mechanics of kirigamized sheets (see electronic supplementary material, S2), starting from the
nonlinear elastic energy of a triangulated plate that is minimized using a conjugate gradient
method. In our simulations, cuts are deﬁned as thin rectangular slits of length l and small width
w, with a semicircular tip of diameter w added to the ends of each cut.
Figure 2a shows the mean curvature of the simulated sheet for different values of the strain γ
when the cut is initially orthogonal (θ = π/2) to the loading axis (the line connecting the loading
points O1 and O2, the separation of which deﬁnes the strain γ ) (ﬁgure 2a(i)). We observe that for
very low strains γ ≪1, the sheet stretches, but remains planar. When γ exceeds a critical value
γc, the sheet buckles with bending deformations becoming localized along two conical domains
centred near each end of the cut, and a large cylindrical domain of nearly uniform mean curvature
κ appears to connect the cut ends and the loading points on both sides. Further stretching of the
sheet causes an increase in the curvature of these cylindrical domains, and reduces the Euclidean
distance between the end-points (A and B) of the cuts from its initial length (see electronic
supplementary material, movie S1). This deformation localization enables the three-dimensional
straightening of geodesics, the minimal-length curves connecting the loading points O1, O2 that

do not cross any cuts, shown in ﬁgure 2a,b; details of the geodesic construction and behaviour are
described in §4.
Simultaneously, the free edges associated with the cut deform into a shape that resembles
Euler’s elastica [9] as shown in ﬁgure 2c. When the applied strain becomes very large, the end
points of these elasticae, corresponding to the ends of the cut, come together consistent with
the geodesics straightening in three dimensions. If the sheet thickness is very small (h/R →0),
the bending energy of the sheet becomes negligible relative to the stretching energy, and any
deformations must become approximately isometric. Based on our observations, we expect that
in this limit, the sheet will approach a ﬂat folded state, a conﬁguration discussed in §4.
Moving from this geometric description of the sheet to its mechanical properties, the force–
displacement response of the kirigami sheet described in ﬁgure 2a–c is shown in ﬁgure 2d. At
low values of strain γ , the force is linearly proportional to γ , but once the sheet buckles, the force
plateaus as the sheet deforms by bending out of the plane. Eventually, as the ends of the cut come
together, the sheet stiffens as it cannot deform any further without signiﬁcant stretching and the
force increases, showing a divergent behaviour. In the buckled state, there are two alternate modes
of deformation: a symmetric mode when both cylindrical domains on either side of the cut are
in-phase, and an antisymmetric mode where both cylindrical domains on either side of the cut
are out-of-phase. The plateau force for these two cases differs marginally, but the linear and the
divergent responses away from the plateaus are indistinguishable as can be seen in ﬁgure 2d.
To understand the origin of this divergence, we use a scaling approach. The torque due to the
applied force f acting over a length S corresponding to the (small) distance between the ends of
the cut is balanced by the internal elastic torque Bκc where κc is the characteristic mean curvature
in the neighbourhood of the end of the cut, with B as the ﬂexural modulus of the sheet, so that
fS ∼Bκc. As shown in ﬁgure 3b, at the ends of the cut of small width w, the characteristic curvature
κc ∼θc/w, where θc is the angle at the cut’s corner. As the sheet is pulled apart by the forces
so that the cut edges are 2Rγ apart at their widest, geometry implies that θcS/2 ∼2Rγ and S ≈

expressed in a more familiar form ˆf ∼1/(1 −2R(1 + γ )/lg) where ˆf = f/(BwR) which we see is
the same as the divergent response of a freely jointed polymer chain [10]. The inset to ﬁgure 2d
shows that the mechanical response with the rescaled deﬁnition of the stretch agrees well with this
simple scaling estimate. We pause to make two comments: (i) the divergent mechanical response
of freely jointed chain is intimately linked to the balance between entropic effects and a ﬁnite
chain length, quite unlike the divergent response of the athermal kirigami sheet, which is due to
the localization of curvature of the sheet at the ends of the cut and (ii) the geometric origin of the
divergent behaviour suggests that single-cut kirigami can serve as a building block for a new type
of lockable mechanical response [11] that is material independent, and can instead be controlled
by geometry and topology.
Having understood the geometry and mechanical response of a sheet with a single
symmetrically placed cut, we ask what would happen when the cut’s length l and/or orientation
θ is varied. Figure 3a inset shows the mechanical response for various cases where l is varied

keeping the cut orientation orthogonal to the clamped axis (θ = π/2) in red curves. The mechanical
response in all cases is qualitatively similar to ﬁgure 3a, with a shift in the applied strain γ at
the onset of plateau response, the magnitude of the plateau force, and the strain at the onset of
divergent response. Larger l results in a lower value of the threshold in γ and a lower force plateau
persisting for longer, before the force diverges. Similarly, changing the orientation θ of the cut
changes the mechanical response by increasing the plateau force value, as the initial cut direction
is more aligned with the direction of the clamping axis. The deformed geometric conﬁgurations
for all these cases are shown in electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S3.
To quantify these observations, we note that the linear response at very small strain
corresponds to the planar stretching of sheet. We note similarities of our scaling analysis to
previous studies [4,12,13], and hence keep the discussion on the linear regime and the onset of
the nonlinear response very brief here. The presence of the cut leads to a stress intensiﬁcation
near the ends of the cut. As ﬁrst described in Inglis’ seminal work [14], the stress near the tip of

l (see electronic
supplementary material, ﬁgure S2b). Following the initial linear increase in the force with applied
strain, the sheet buckles when the compressive load on a plate of size corresponding to the length
of a cut reaches a threshold given by the buckling stress σb ∼B/hl2, with B being the ﬂexural
rigidity of the sheet, so that the buckling force fb ∼(B/h2R)(1/l2) (see electronic supplementary
material, ﬁgure S2d). Then the strain at which the sheet buckles (γb) can be estimated from a
balance of the in-plane stress (∼Eγb/

l/w) with the buckling stress, so that γb ∼1/(l/R)3/2 (see
also electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S2c).
Following the onset of buckling, for small out-of-plane displacements δ ≪l of the cut
boundary, the curvature of the deformed cylindrical core of the sheet scales as κ ∼δ/l2. Thus
the total bending energy of the sheet scales as U ∼Eh3κ2A ∼Eh3δ2R/l3, with A ∼Rl being the
area of the quadrilateral O1AO2B shown in ﬁgure 2a. Further, the out-of-plane displacement can
be expressed as δ ≈Rγ 1/2, and hence U ∼Eh3R3γ/l3. Thus the force scales as f = ∂U/∂(Rγ ) ∼
Eh3R2/l3 (see electronic supplementary material, §S3 and ﬁgure S1). For a cut oriented at an
arbitrary angle θ to the clamped axis, we replace l by its orthogonal projection to the loading axis
l sin θ. Figure 3a shows the collapsed data from ﬁgure 3a inset, indicating that the bending energy
localization in the elasticae corresponding to the two edges of cut determines the magnitude of
plateau response in the force–displacement curves. We note that we have ignored the contribution
of energy from the conical domains since the size of conical domains is much smaller than the
cylinder-like domains just above the onset of out-of-plane deformation, and the mean curvature
decays away from the cone tip as κ ∼1/r. At large applied strain, when the geodesics are relatively
better aligned with the loading axis, application of further strain induces a strong bending
deformation at the cut corners. Sheets with a ﬁnite tearing threshold stress generally tear as a
result of this deformation, and this raises a class of different questions about the nature and shape
of the curve of tearing [15], which we do not discuss here. Figure 3c depicts the rescaled force–
displacement curves showing the divergence response of sheets with varying cut length, which
agree well with the scaling arguments given by equation (2.1).
3. Geometry and mechanics of a sheet with multiple cuts
We now turn to understand how the geometric mechanics of single-cut kirigami translates into
our understanding of sheets with multiple cuts. In ﬁgure 4a, the mean curvature maps of the
deformed sheet show the similarity in the localized deformation for the different cases with the
number of cuts N, all of which are perpendicular to the loading axis, varying from 2 to 12 (see
electronic supplementary material, movie S2 and ﬁgure S6). We see that the deformed geometry
in all cases consists of four conical domains, and N + 1 connected elasticae N. Indeed, regardless
of the number of cuts, the conical domains localize to the ends of cuts that are nearest to the
loading points while the sheet remains ﬂat in between. Figure 4b shows the mechanical response
of sheets kirigamized with varying number of cuts and shows that increasing the number of
cuts softens the system, reducing the plateau force and delaying the transition to the ultimately
divergent force–displacement response.
To characterize the mechanical response in the case with multiple cuts, we approximate
the bending deformations as localized in N + 1 elasticae close to the onset of out-of-plane
deformation so that the elastic energy U ∼Eh3R2dγ/l3, and hence the force f ∼∂U/∂(Rγ ) ∼
Eh3Rd/l3, where d is the distance between the loading point and the nearest cut (see electronic
supplementary material, §S3 and ﬁgure S4). Consistent with this, rescaling the force with d
collapses the data over the scale of intermediate deformations as shown in the inset of ﬁgure 4b.
At large strains, the strong bending deformations near the cone tips appear similar to the case
with a single cut discussed earlier. Predicting the potential sites of structural failure in practical
applications requires knowledge of the location of conical domains. Our observations suggest

that the high-stress conical domains will appear at the ends of a particular cut, if the presence of
that cut increases the geodesic length lg. To formalize this, we deﬁne a binary participation ratio

where l0
g is the geodesic length evaluated for a given arrangement that includes cut i, and l−i
g is the
geodesic length with the ith cut removed from the arrangement. For the cases shown in ﬁgure 4a,
the two cuts nearest to the loading points have a PR = 1 and all other cuts have PR = 0. Similarly,
for the cases with two cuts of varying projected lengths (see electronic supplementary material,
ﬁgure S5), conical domains disappear at the corners of cuts with PR = 0. In ﬁgure 4a, we see
that an increase in the number of cuts increases the geodesic length lg. Since the divergent force–
displacement response emerges as 2R(1 + γ ) →lg, the plateau response in the force–displacement
curves is observed at larger γ for larger N. In cases with N > 2, ﬁxing the location of the cuts
closest to the points of force application sets the trajectory of geodesics as well as the geodesic
length lg, regardless of the presence of the inner cuts. In ﬁgure 4c, we see that the mean curvature
ﬁeld of the kirigamized sheets with different cut conﬁgurations results in similar proﬁles. Each
case has two conical domains that appear at the corners of the cuts closest to the points of
force application, a cylindrical core extending between the two loading points whose extent is
deﬁned by the cut length. Since the geodesic length is the same for all the cases in ﬁgure 4c, the
divergent response occurs at the same strain regardless of the presence of the inner cuts; in fact,

the force–displacement curves overlap at all applied strains for such cases, and the geometry of
the deformed sheets is almost identical as shown in ﬁgure 4d.
When cuts are distributed in a disordered manner on a loaded sheet, the geometry of the
geodesics continues to control the mechanical response of the overall system. In ﬁgure 5a, we
show an example with 21 cuts of the same length (totaling 8R), with randomly chosen locations
of the cut midpoint and its orientation, but with a minimum separation between the cuts and
between the cut and the loading points. The localization of deformation in participating cuts’
elasticae and conical domains is evident, while the sheet remains ﬂat and undeformed near cuts
with PR = 0 (also see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S7).
To obtain the average response for the case of disordered kirigami, we repeat the simulations
keeping the sum  l constant. Figure 5d shows the mechanical response for these disordered
kirigami structures averaged over 10 samples per case. The overall nature of the force–
displacement curve is similar to that of a single cut, with the plateau force decreasing for longer
cuts. When the sum of the cut lengths  l is small, we see a very weak deviation from the
initial linear response, but with increasing  l a clear plateau is observed. The divergent force–
displacement response is observed when the geodesic connecting the two loading points nearly
straightens out under applied strain, and we observe relatively large variance in force beyond the
initial linear response due to the strong dependence on the cut length and location. Increasing
the number of cuts while keeping  l constant results in similar observations (see electronic
supplementary material, ﬁgure S8) with a lower number of longer length cuts resulting in a lower
plateau force response and an increased variance.
Since the cuts with PR = 0 do not signiﬁcantly affect the geometric mechanics of the sheet,
simply removing them from the given cut arrangement results in a sheet with a nearly identical
geometric and mechanical response to a sheet with a much smaller number of cuts. In
ﬁgure 5b, we show a kirigami pattern derived from that shown in ﬁgure 5a where the cuts
with PR = 0 are removed. When such a structure is loaded, we see that the mean curvature
ﬁeld is quantitatively similar to that in ﬁgure 5a; indeed ﬁgure 5c shows that the force-strain
curves are nearly the same.
It is evident from the observed geometry of disordered kirigami that the dominant modes of
deformation become localized near a few cuts. Disordered cuts behave similarly to structured
cuts, where the mechanical response depends on the distance of the cut from the loading
point(s), its projected length, and its PR. At the onset of the buckling transition from the initial
planar stretching response at very low strains, each cut with PR = 1 introduces a soft bending
deformation mode in the sheet with a characteristic bending force f ∗, given by the smallest
buckling load, i.e.

where di is the minimum distance of the mid-point of the cut of length li from the loading points,
and 2R −di is the distance of the cut midpoint from the farthest loading point, and θdi and θ2R−di
are the angles that the cut makes with the line joining the midpoint of the cut to the points of force
application. The above result follows from the assumption that at the onset of the plateau regime,
the characteristic mean curvature for bending localization is set by the cut that corresponds to f ∗,
so that the two terms in equation (3.2) follow from the energy of two elasticae that exist on both
sides of the cut. Here, we note that the cuts with PR = 0 do not alter the plateau response near
its onset as seen with the cases in ﬁgures 4b and 5c. These observations allow us to determine
the rescaled mechanical response shown in the inset of ﬁgure 5d, providing a reasonable collapse
in the plateau region of force–displacement data. The spread in the scaled data is likely due to
the simpliﬁcation that the area of the sheet where energy is localized is assumed to span the
sheet (hence the factor 2R in equation (3.2)), and that additional cuts which buckle following the
onset of ﬁrst buckling also contribute to localizing the bending deformation. All together, this
allows us to reduce a given disordered kirigamized sheet to a simpler ‘mechanical equivalent’

(e.g. ﬁgure 5b). Thus, our simple scaling approach reduces the complexity of disordered kirigami
using elementary geometric mechanics.
4. Rectifying the geodesics and the flat-foldable kirigami
For an initially ﬂat sheet, our observations suggest that the shortest path between the points of
force application for simple cut patterns is just a polygonal curve that connects these points,
i.e. geodesics in a planar sheet with random cuts are polygonal. When a very thin sheet is
deformed by boundary forces, its ultimate shape is characterized by the formation of sharp

Figure 6. (a) (Adapted from [16].) The path-shortening algorithm yields a polygonal competing to be a geodesic. (b–d)
Strongly stretched inextensible sheets of negligible bending rigidity, h →0, can be flat-folded to two-dimensional sheets
while simultaneously rectifying all geodesics to lie along a single straight segment in space.
creases as the sheet folds on itself, as shown in ﬁgure 6b–d. These observations of the geometry of
strongly deformed kirigamized sheets show that the polygonal geodesic in the plane become an
approximately straight geodesic in R3 connecting the points of force application. The sheet can
be then ﬂat-folded, leading to a conﬁguration that is a piecewise afﬁne isometric immersion of
the plane. We leave precise theorems and proofs of these statements for a separate study [16], but
provide a brief summary of the results here.
(a) Polygonal structure of the geodesics
We represent the given set of cuts L, contained within an open, bounded, convex domain Ω ⊂R2,
as the union of the edges of a graph G. Without loss of generality, G may be taken as planar,
i.e. each pair of its edges intersects at most at a single common vertex. The polygonal structure
of geodesics follows from the idea of a path-shortening algorithm (ﬁgure 6a). Given O1, O2 ∈
¯Ω \ L and a piecewise C1 curve τ : [0, 1] →¯Ω \ L with τ(0) = O1 and τ(1) = O2, one successively
replaces its portions by segments, as follows. Firstly, for t > 0 sufﬁciently small, the segment O1τ(t)
does not intersect L. Let t1 ∈(0, 1] be the ﬁrst time that the segment O1τ(t1) intersects L. If τ(t1) =
O2, then O1O2 is the desired geodesic connecting O1 and O2. Otherwise, O1τ(t1) must contain
some of the vertices of the cuts. Call p1 the closest one of these vertices to τ(t1) and perform
the concatenation of the segment p1τ(t1) with the curve τ restricted to [t1, 1]. The process is now
repeated from p1. After ﬁnitely many such steps one obtains a polygonal connecting O1 and O2,
with a shorter length than τ.
(b) Geodesic rectification and flat foldability
The construction of the desired isometric immersion follows from the folding algorithm below
that consists of three steps. Let O1, O2 ∈∂Ω and denote by lg the length of the geodesics between
O1, O2. Then, we start with two preparatory steps.

Step 1. Sealing portions of inessential cuts that do not affect lg. To this end, label cuts (the edges of G)
by l1, . . . , ln. Move the ﬁrst endpoint vertex of l1 toward its second vertex, and start “sealing” the
portion of the cut l1 left behind. The length of the geodesics connecting O1 and O2 may drop
initially, in which case the conﬁguration is left unchanged. Otherwise, the geodesic distance is
continuously non-increasing, although it may initially remain constant. The sealing process is
stopped when the aforementioned distance becomes strictly less than the original one, and the
new position point is labeled as the new vertex endpoint of l1. In the next step, the remaining
endpoint is moved along l1 toward the (new) ﬁrst endpoint and the process is repeated, thus
possibly sealing the cut l1 further. The same procedure is carried out for each li in the given order
i = 1, . . . , n. It follows that upon repeating the same process for the newly created conﬁguration,
labeled the minimal conﬁguration will not be further altered. While different ordering of cuts and
vertices may yield different minimal conﬁgurations and new geodesics may be created in the cut-
sealing process, all original geodesics are preserved. Also, since the newly created set L is a subset
of the original one, ﬁnding the isometric immersion relative to the new L will yield the desired
isometric immersion.
Step 2: Ordering of the geodesics and connected components of Ω \ L. There are two important
properties of a minimal conﬁguration: the graph G has no loops (i.e. it is a collection of its
connected components that are trees), and each vertex that is a leaf in some tree is a vertex of
some geodesic. With these properties, one proceeds to label all geodesics in a consecutive order,
with τ1 ⪯. . . ⪯τN. Here, τr ⪯τr+1 means that the concatenated polygonal curve from O1 to O2
via τr and then back to O1 via τr+1 encloses a region Dr and it is oriented counterclockwise with
respect to Dr. Next, one labels and orders the trees {Tm}s
m=1 in ¯Dr so that Dr \ L is partitioned into
subregions {Pm}s
m=0 and {Qm}s
m=1 in the following way: each Pm is a polygon bounded by the
“right most” path from the tree Tm, the “left most” path from Tm+1, and the intermediate portions
of τr and τr+1 which are concave with respect to Pm. Each Qm is a ﬁnite union of polygons enclosed
within the single tree Tm, again bounded by the intermediate portions of geodesics τr and τr+1.
Note that τr and τr+1 may have nontrivial overlaps and some of {Qm}s
m=1 may be absent.
Step 3: Constructing a desired isometric immersion. Finally, we ﬁx the segment I = [0, lg] along the
x1-axis in R3. To construct an isometric immersion u of Ω \ L such that u(O1) = 0, u(O2) = lge1,
u(τr) = I for r = 1, . . . , N, and where each segment on τr is mapped onto a designated segment
portion of I, we ﬁrst note that u consists exclusively of planar folds and returns the image that
is a subset of R2. By Step 2, Dr = 	s
m=0 Pm ∪	s
m=1 Qm, for r = 1, · · · , N −1, so that it is possible
to construct u on P0, Q1, Q2, . . . , Qm, Pm, even though the step to construct u on P1, . . . , Pm−1 can
be highly technical [16]. Since the exterior region D0 = Ω \ 	N−1
r=0 Dr does not contain trees, the
two outermost geodesics σ1 and σN are convex, and so the deﬁnition of u on D0 consists of
several simple folds. We note that the condition O1, O2 ∈∂Ω is essential here: indeed there exist
minimal conﬁgurations for O1, O2 /∈∂Ω, that do not admit any isometry u with the property that
the Euclidean distance from u(O1) to u(O2) equals the geodesic distance from O1 to O2 in Ω \ L
(for further details, we refer to [16]).
5. Functional kirigami structures
The geometric mechanics of ordered and disordered kirigami leads us naturally to questions of
design for function. We apply the principles discussed so far to three examples: a soft gripper
with multiple modes of grasping, a family of kirigami designs displaying optical transmittance
and shielding properties, and a physically unclonable function based on the inherent disorder in
the deformation of kirigami sheets.
(a) Active and passive gripping
The opening of a kirigami slit upon loading suggests its potential as a soft grasper, its shape
modulated by an applied force or strain at the boundary [12,18]. To be effective, a grasper

must enable controlled gripping, lifting and relocating objects of varying scales and shapes with
minimal energy input.
We deﬁne a passive grasper as one that only requires external work to be done in order to
grasp or release the object, with energy-free relocation while an active grasper requires continuous
application of an external force (external energy) to grasp and relocate, as shown in the schematics
in ﬁgure 7b,c. Kirigami enables both designs; while the active grasper accommodates the target
object in the curved features of the deformed sheet, the passive grasper uses the cuts to
accommodate objects.
The simplest passive grasper design, a single slit perpendicular to the loading axis, requires
a prestretch to deform the cut into a hole that can accommodate the target object. On releasing
the prestretch, the cut boundary relaxes to contact the object, grasping it with no further energy
input. After relocation, the arrested object can be released by applying an extensional strain to
the sheet.
However, a potential drawback of this solution is that the object is liable to rotate in order to
accommodate the two point-like forces from the cut edge on either side. Our disordered kirigami
observations suggest adding more cuts softens the grasper’s loading curve, enabling symmetric
deformation and reducing the severity of sudden reorientations at a minor cost to the maximum
load bearing capacity. Hence, an effective design of a kirigamized grasper is one that has multiple
smaller cuts in addition to a larger cut in the middle as shown in ﬁgure 7a. The additional cuts
are prescribed in a way that all cuts have a PR = 1, and buckle under the applied strain. Further,
the largest cut is split in the middle by a small cut, oriented along the pulling axis. Together these
features enable symmetric deformation of the ﬂat kirigami sheet, and improve the stability of
contact with the grasped object. The additional contact points may not help stabilize the grasped
object if the size of the object is much smaller than that cut length, in which case the grasped
object may slip during handling. We note that the simplest kirigamized grasper with a single cut
(ﬁgure 2a) deforms asymmetrically, and hence cannot be effectively used as a grasper in both
active and passive modes. In practical scenarios however symmetric deformation can be realized
if the sheet is stretched signiﬁcantly [19].
The ﬁnal design sequence is demonstrated in ﬁgure 7b,c and visualized in the electronic
supplementary material, movie S3. In this passive mode, the conical tips and the cylindrical core
of the kirigami sheet enables conﬁnement of the target object as shown in ﬁgure 7b and electronic
supplementary material, movie S3. The same geometry also functions as an active grasper, as the
two ends of the middle cut are forced toward each other as loading is applied. For the symmetric
deformations, this may be used to encase an object with compressive force and relocate it, as
shown in ﬁgure 7c.
The range of applicability of a general kirigami grasper can be understood from a balance
of the forces due to the bending of kirigami sheet, and the weight of the grasped object. For
a cut of length l, the characteristic grasping force of the deformed sheet can be written as
fg ∼μ(B/l)c(γ ), with μ being the coefﬁcient of friction and c(γ ) is a strain-dependent geometric
factor. For an object with effective density ρ and size l, force balance yields μ(B/l)c(γ ) ∼ρgl3.
This provides a non-dimensional parameter ρgl4/(μBc(γ )), which has values ranging between
1 and 100 for the successful grasping demonstrations we attempted using a plastic grasper.
For a kirigami gripper with an arbitrary conﬁguration of cuts, the geometric and mechanical
response of kirigamized sheets in various ordered and disordered cases can help estimate the
non-dimensional kirigami grasper parameter. This is because the nature of force–strain curve for
ordered/disordered kirigami is universal (schematics in ﬁgure 7b,c) and knowing the force in the
extensible regime, i.e. force corresponding to points 1, 3 in ﬁgure 7b and point 2 in ﬁgure 7c, will
help determine the operating regime of the gripper.
(b) Selective transmittance
Although our discussion so far has been restricted to piecewise linear cuts, the ideas established
are applicable to cuts with ﬁnite planar curvature. Inspired by the recent efforts towards

design of kirigami-based mechanically deployable structures [1], we demonstrate a family of
deployable kirigami designs whose force-dependent transmittance properties can be tuned by
varying a single geometric parameter. The application follows directly from our observations (in
ﬁgures 2–5) and analysis in ﬁgure 6 that with the increasing strain the geodesic in kirigamized
structures straightens out and the cuts with PR = 1 localize the bending deformation. Thus, a
careful choice of cuts (and hence the geodesic) can be used to embed force/strain-dependent
functional features in kirigamized sheets.
Figure 8a shows three cases of physical kirigamized sheets perforated with ﬁve concentric
circular arcs, differing only by a parameter dφ that deﬁnes the arcuate cuts that extend between
±dφ and ±(π −dφ) with respect to the vertical axis, while the radius is linearly increased between
the ﬁve arcs. We see that the planar kirigami sheets (with marginally different dφ) show very
different geometric mechanics under a small applied strain. When dφ = π/60, none of the cuts
intersect the vertical diameter, leaving a straight geodesic connecting O1 and O2; hence, tensile
loading of this structure results in simple in-plane stretching along this diameter.
However, a small change in dφ to −π/180 results in each of the circular cuts now intersecting
the vertical diameter, resulting in a geodesic connecting O1 and O2 that must meander around
the corners of all cuts. Under an applied load, this structure shows a large relative out-of-plane
displacement of different domains of the sheet (see electronic supplementary material, movie
S4). Further increasing the angular extent of the cuts by taking dφ = −π/30 makes the geodesic

Figure 8. A kirigami light window. (a) Experimental images of kirigami sheets with circular curved cuts (dashed lines on top
row) show very different responses to an applied strain when the cut geometry is varied. Red curves represent the geodesic
connecting loading points O1 and O2, which changes dramatically as the curved cuts are very slightly extended or shortened
near the vertical diameter. dφ represents the angular deviation of each cut’s endpoint with respect to this vertical diameter.
When dφ > 0, the geodesic is simply the diameter connecting the loading points. However, when the cuts begin to intersect
this diameter for dφ < 0, the geodesic must take a different path and significantly alters the deployed geometry. Physical
parameters are identical to those in figure 1. (b) A phase diagram quantifying the transmittance (left axis) of the deployed

qualitatively change, as it now skirts the two outermost cuts without intersecting any of the
inner cuts. Since the inner cuts have PR = 0, and hence do not introduce any soft deformation
modes, under an applied deformation, the outer frame localizes the bending while the inner
structure stays nearly planar without any deformation, and is thus shielded mechanically and
geometrically.
We now quantify some of the functional responses of these kirigamized structures using
dφ as the only tunable parameter. A straightforward observation is that the force required to
deform such a class of structures increases monotonically with dφ (see electronic supplementary
material, ﬁgure S11a). Very different geometric consequences due to changing geodesic paths can
be quantiﬁed in terms of the transmittance of the kirigami structure. In practice, transmittance
may correspond to the light transmitted though an optical window when illuminated with light
rays perpendicular to the rest plane. In experiments, we restrict the deformation to small strains
approximately 1%, a practically relevant regime, and note that geometric mechanics are generally
strain-dependent.

Figure 8b shows a phase diagram of transmittance (left axis) measured at 1% strain as
a function of dφ, along with the computed geodesic length normalized by diameter (lg/2R)
for reference. The transmittance curves clearly display non-monotonic trends. Transmittance is
achievable in the cases when lg →2R, and the strain sensitivity of transmittance is enhanced with
increasing lg/2R (see electronic supplementary material, ﬁgure S11b). For cases with dφ > 0, we
note lg/2R = 1 and we see only weak variation of transmittance, since these structures must deform
primarily by planar stretching.
(c) Kirigami-based physically unclonable function
We close with an unusual application of kirigami for encoding information, inspired by the
fact that for a given conﬁguration of cuts in a sheet, every choice of a loading axis ‘activates’
a distinct set of deformations anchored at different cuts (i.e. cuts with PR ̸= 0), each leading
to a distinct geometrical response. Such a system in principle can be employed to encrypt
information geometrically in a ﬂat kirigamized sheet. Encoding information in such a system
involves a choice of the number of cuts (N), parameters associated with each cut (xi, yi, li and θi),
a loading axis, and an extensional strain γ . The resulting high-dimensional design space leads to
a rich nonlinear strain-dependent and possibly discontinuous shape response.
This observation allows us to use kirigami sheets that are easy to realize practically in creating
physically unclonable functions (PUFs), building on the notion that the inherent disorder in many
physical systems is a promising hardware route towards roots-of-trust cryptographic keys [20,21].
Speciﬁcally, a kirigami PUF is generated by activating/stretching a kirigamized sheet along a
loading axis up to a ﬁxed nominal strain. The deformed sheet is then imaged with a camera
held at a ﬁxed distance and orthogonal to the initial plane of the sheet, and a z-displacement
map is created for the deformed structure. We store this z-displacement map, i.e. |z| as a PUF
key. For future authentication, the user will need to know the cut conﬁguration, loading axis
and the extensional strain to duplicate such a key. Figure 9a shows a planar kirigamized sheet
with disordered cuts, and ﬁgure 9b shows the greyscale z-displacement maps of the kirigami
structure for different strain values and a different choice of loading axis. Since we use a two-
dimensional z-displacement map as a PUF key, we rely on a measure of image similarity index to
match keys between different experiments. Here, we use the multiscale structural similarity index
function in MATLAB [22] to compare different keys. The index quantiﬁes the luminance, contrast
and structure of several versions of the image at various scales, with its values ranging between
0 and 1 (1 being the highest possible match).
To demonstrate the effectiveness of kirigami as a PUF in a minimal setting, we keep the cut
conﬁguration of the kirigamized sheet ﬁxed and only vary the loading axis and the applied strain.
The versatility of the kirigami PUF is directly linked to the nonlinear geometric mechanics of
disordered kirigami, and our observations make it evident that kirigamized sheets will yield
a deterministic geometric mechanical response. Thus given complete information about all the
variables involved, the PUF key will be deterministic. In practice, having a large number of cuts
will make it very difﬁcult to be reverse engineered by an adversary.
A robust PUF system will return signiﬁcantly different (false) PUF keys if there exists a
mismatch between the loading axis and the applied strain that corresponds to the stored
(true) PUF key, because even a small variation in the loading axis by dθ results in a sharp decrease
in the key similarity as shown in ﬁgure 9c. As an example, setting a threshold value on the
similarity index to 0.9 will enable a robust response from this PUF system, and yet allows for
a margin of error in ±dθ. In ﬁgure 9d, we show that there is a similar robustness in the PUF
keys when the applied extensional strain is varied. Indeed, we see that kirigami-based PUF are
only effective when the strain is large enough for the structure to undergo substantial out-of-
plane deformation and corresponds to the plateau regime in the force–displacement curve. In the
vicinity of the strain corresponding to the stored key, a slight error in the applied strain does not
impact the PUF performance, while a signiﬁcant deviation results in a poor match.

6. Discussion
Our study of ordered and disordered kirigami has shown how elementary geometric and
energetic concepts allow us to understand the three-dimensional structure and mechanical
response of kirigamized sheets. The general principles relating the mechanical response of such
sheets to their geometry, along with scaling arguments for all regimes of deformation, reduces
a complex nonlinear problem to a combination of simple geometrical constructions, potentially
easing the search for novel kirigami-based engineering solutions in instances such as grasping,
windowing and encoding information. We believe that these examples are just the beginning of
a different way of thinking about functional aspects of topological and geometrical mechanical
metamaterials.
