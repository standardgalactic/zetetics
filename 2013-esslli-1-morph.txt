consonants – involve some constriction
vowels – no constriction; can always be held indeﬁnitely.

Describing Consonants
Voicing – do vocal folds vibrate?
voiced – yes: [b], [d], [g] [m], [n], [N], [z], [Z], . . .
voiceless – no: [p], [t], [k], [s], [S], . . .
Place of Articulation – place of obstruction (lips, teeth, . . . )
Bilabial – [p], [b], [m], [w]
Labiodental - [f], [v]
Interdental – [T], [D]
Alveolar: – [t], [d], [s], [z], [n], ...
Palatal: – [S] (ship), [Z] (visual), [j] (yes)
Velar: – [k], [g], [N] (walking)
etc.
Manner of Articulation – degree of obstruction
Stops: ﬂow of air is stopped – [p, b, t, d, k, g]
Fricatives: narrow constriction – [f, v, T, D, s, S, z, Z, x, h]
Nasals (nasal stops): air passes also through the nose – [m, n, N]
etc.

Natural classes
In these rules we can refer to classes of sounds like:
voiced consonants ([b, d, g, D, z, Z, n, m, . . . ]),
rounded vowels ([u, U, o, O]),
nasals ([m, n, N]),
sibilants (hissy sounds [s, z, S, Z, tS, dZ],

Common types of phonological rules
Assimilation – a sound becomes more like a nearby sound.
place assimilation: comfort [Mf], input [mp]
voicing assimilation talks [ks] vs. dogs [gz]
bit [I] vs. bin [˜I] – /I/ assimilates to the following /n/ (nasal)
easier to pronounce
Insertion
hamster /hæmstr/ →[hæm(p)str]: [p] is sometimes inserted
Deletion
okay [okey] →[Pkey] (optional)
easier and faster to say

What is morphology?
Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words.
The ﬁrst linguists were primarily morphologists.
Well-structured lists of morphological forms of Sumerian words were
attested on clay tablets from Ancient Mesopotamia and date from
around 1600 BC

Morphology (cont.)
Morphology was also prominent in the writings of P¯an
˙
ini (5th
century BC), and in the Greek and Roman grammatical tradition.
Until the 19th century, Western linguists often thought of grammar
as consisting primarily of rules determining word structure (because
Greek and Latin, the classical languages had fairly rich
morphological patterns).

Morph. The term morpheme is used both to refer to an abstract
entity and its concrete realization(s) in speech or writing. When it is
needed to maintain the signiﬁed and signiﬁer distinction, the term
morph is used to refer to the concrete entity, while the term
morpheme is reserved for the abstract entity only.

Allomorphy
Allomorphs are variants of the same morpheme, i.e., morphs
corresponding to the same morpheme; they have the same function
but diﬀerent forms. Unlike the synonyms they usually cannot be
replaced one by the other.

Postpositional and head-ﬁnal languages use suﬃxes and no preﬁxes;
But prepositional and head-initial languages use not only preﬁxes, as
expected, but also suﬃxes.
Many languages use exclusively suﬃxes and no preﬁxes (e.g., Basque,
Finnish),
Very few languages use only preﬁxes and no suﬃxes (e.g., Thai, but
in derivation, not in inﬂection).

Several attempts to explain this asymmetry (see Hana & Culicover

processing arguments (Cutler et al 1985, Hawkins & Gilligan 1988),
historical arguments (Giv`on 1979), and
combinations of both (Hall 1988).

There are two rather diﬀerent kinds of morphological relationship among
words, for which two technical terms are commonly used:
Inﬂection: creates new forms of the same word
bring, brought, brings, bringing
Derivation: creates new words

Complications with terminology
The terminology is common, but not universally accepted, for example:
Lemma and lexeme are often used interchangeably
Sometimes lemma is used to denote all forms related by derivation.
Paradigm can stand for the following:
1
A particular way of inﬂecting a class of lexemes (e.g., plural is formed
by adding -s).
2
Set of forms of one lexeme
3
Mixture of the previous two: Set of forms of an arbitrarily chosen
lexeme, showing the way a certain set of lexemes is inﬂected.

Derivation tends to aﬀects the meaning of the word, while inﬂection
tends to aﬀect only its syntactic function.
Derivation tends to be more irregular – there are more gaps, the
meaning is more idiosyncratic and less compositional.

Morphological types of languages
Morphology is not equally prominent in all languages. What one
language expresses morphologically may be expressed by diﬀerent means
in another language.
English: Aspect is expressed by certain syntactic structures:
(7) a. John wrote/has written a letter. (complete)
b. John was writing a letter.
(process)
Russian: Aspect is marked mostly by preﬁxes:
(8) a. John napisal pis’mo.
(the action is complete)
b. John pisal pis’mo.
(process).

Morphological types of languages (cont.)
There are two basic morphological types of languages:
Analytic – have only free morphemes, sentences are sequences of
single-morpheme words.

PLURAL
tˆoi

bat

l`am b`ai
homework
When I came to my friend’s house, we began to do homework.
Synthetic – both free and bound morphemes. Aﬃxes are added to
roots.

Morphological types of languages – synthetic
Synthetic languages have further subtypes:
Agglutinating – each morpheme has a single function, it is easy to
separate them.
E.g., Uralic lgs (Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian), Turkish, Basque,
Dravidian lgs (Tamil, Kannada, Telugu), Esperanto
Turkish:

Morphological types of languages – synthetic
Fusional – like agglutinating, but aﬃxes tend to “fuse together”,
one aﬃx has more than one function.
E.g., Slavic, Romance languages, Greek
Serbian/Croatian: the number and case of nouns is expressed by one
suﬃx:
singular
plural
nominative
ovc-a
ovc-e
‘ovca ‘sheep’
genitive
ovc-e
ovac-a
ovac+0 ?? dative
ovc-i
ovc-ama
accusative
ovc-u
ovc-e
vocative
ovc-o
ovc-e
local
ovc-o
ovc-e
instrumental
ovc-om
ovc-ama
It is not possible to isolate separate singular or plural or nominative or
accusative morphemes.

English – originally fusional, but now both analytic properties (future
morpheme will, perfective morpheme have, etc. are separate words)
and synthetic properties (plural (-s), etc. are bound morphemes)
Czech (similarly other Slavic lgs) – mostly fusional, but also other
properties:
analytic: future and past tense, conditional, prepositions, . . .
agglutinating: preﬁxes/suﬃxes; vidˇe- n- a ‘seenfem.sg’ -n- – passive, -a

Zero morpheme (cont.)
Should all meanings be assigned to a morpheme?
If yes, then one is forced to posit zero morphemes (e.g., oli-Ø, where
the morpheme Ø stands for the third person singular)
But the requirement is not necessary, and alternatively one could
say, for instance, that Finnish has no marker for the third person
singular in verbs.

Complications – Empty morphemes
The opposite of zero morphemes are empty morphemes.
Four of Lezgian’s sixteen cases:
absolutive
sew
ﬁl
Rahim
genitive
sew-re-n
ﬁl-di-n
Rahim-a-n
dative
sew-re-z
ﬁl-di-z
Rahim-a-z
subessive
sew-re-k
ﬁl-di-k
Rahim-a-k
‘bear’
‘elephant’
(male name)
This suﬃx, called the oblique stem suﬃx in Lezgian grammar, has
no meaning, but it must be posited if we want to have an elegant
description.
With the notion of an empty morpheme we can say that diﬀerent
nouns select diﬀerent suppletive oblique stem suﬃxes, but that the
actual case suﬃxes that are aﬃxed to the oblique stem are uniform
for all nouns.
What is an alternative analysis?

Momma aka diaper changer, snot wiper, head chef, laundry specialist,
maid, toy gatherer, taxi driver, boo-boo kisser, tucker-inner...well you

Clitics
Clitics are units that are transitional between words and aﬃxes, having
some properties of words and some properties of aﬃxes.

Clitics vs. Words
Unlike words, clitics:
Placement of clitics is more restricted.
Cannot stand in isolation.
Cannot bear contrastive stress.

Clitics vs. Aﬃxes
Unlike aﬃxes, clitics:
Are less selective to which word (their host) they attach, e.g. host’s
part-of-speech may play no role.
Phonological processes that occur across morpheme boundary do
not occur across host-clitic boundary.

The way clitics are spelled also varies within a single language:
written as aﬃxes of their host
English: don’tcha
Czech: Cos ‘what+reﬂ’, proˇn ‘for him’
separated by punctuation
English: possessive ’s
Czech: -li ‘if’ (Vidˇel-li auto . . . ‘If he saw a car . . . ’)
written as separate words
English: her: He sees her [Hi siz hr] (word) vs. [Hi sizr] (clitic)
French: le ‘him’ vs. lui (Je le vois ‘I see him’ vs. *Je lui vois)
