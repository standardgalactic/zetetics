ABSTRACT
Adversarial learning methods have been proposed for a wide range of applications,
but the training of adversarial models can be notoriously unstable. Effectively bal-
ancing the performance of the generator and discriminator is critical, since a dis-
criminator that achieves very high accuracy will produce relatively uninformative
gradients. In this work, we propose a simple and general technique to constrain
information ﬂow in the discriminator by means of an information bottleneck. By
enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the observations and the
discriminator’s internal representation, we can effectively modulate the discrimi-
nator’s accuracy and maintain useful and informative gradients. We demonstrate
that our proposed variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB) leads to signiﬁcant
improvements across three distinct application areas for adversarial learning algo-
rithms. Our primary evaluation studies the applicability of the VDB to imitation
learning of dynamic continuous control skills, such as running. We show that our
method can learn such skills directly from raw video demonstrations, substantially
outperforming prior adversarial imitation learning methods. The VDB can also be
combined with adversarial inverse reinforcement learning to learn parsimonious
reward functions that can be transferred and re-optimized in new settings. Finally,
we demonstrate that VDB can train GANs more effectively for image generation,
improving upon a number of prior stabilization methods. (Video1)

INTRODUCTION
Adversarial learning methods provide a promising approach to modeling distributions over high-
dimensional data with complex internal correlation structures. These methods generally use a dis-
criminator to supervise the training of a generator in order to produce samples that are indistinguish-
able from the data. A particular instantiation is generative adversarial networks, which can be used
for high-ﬁdelity generation of images (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Karras et al., 2017) and other high-
dimensional data (Vondrick et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018; Donahue et al., 2018). Adversarial methods
can also be used to learn reward functions in the framework of inverse reinforcement learning (Finn
et al., 2016a; Fu et al., 2017), or to directly imitate demonstrations (Ho & Ermon, 2016). However,
they suffer from major optimization challenges, one of which is balancing the performance of the
generator and discriminator. A discriminator that achieves very high accuracy can produce relatively
uninformative gradients, but a weak discriminator can also hamper the generator’s ability to learn.
These challenges have led to widespread interest in a variety of stabilization methods for adversarial
learning algorithms (Arjovsky et al., 2017; Kodali et al., 2017; Berthelot et al., 2017).
In this work, we propose a simple regularization technique for adversarial learning, which constrains
the information ﬂow from the inputs to the discriminator using a variational approximation to the
information bottleneck. By enforcing a constraint on the mutual information between the input
observations and the discriminator’s internal representation, we can encourage the discriminator
to learn a representation that has heavy overlap between the data and the generator’s distribution,
thereby effectively modulating the discriminator’s accuracy and maintaining useful and informative

gradients for the generator. Our approach to stabilizing adversarial learning can be viewed as an
adaptive variant of instance noise (Salimans et al., 2016; Sønderby et al., 2016; Arjovsky & Bottou,
2017). However, we show that the adaptive nature of this method is critical. Constraining the mutual
information between the discriminator’s internal representation and the input allows the regularizer
to directly limit the discriminator’s accuracy, which automates the choice of noise magnitude and
applies this noise to a compressed representation of the input that is speciﬁcally optimized to model
the most discerning differences between the generator and data distributions.
The main contribution of this work is the variational discriminator bottleneck (VDB), an adaptive
stochastic regularization method for adversarial learning that substantially improves performance
across a range of different application domains, examples of which are available in Figure 1. Our
method can be easily applied to a variety of tasks and architectures. First, we evaluate our method
on a suite of challenging imitation tasks, including learning highly acrobatic skills from mocap data
with a simulated humanoid character. Our method also enables characters to learn dynamic contin-
uous control skills directly from raw video demonstrations, and drastically improves upon previous
work that uses adversarial imitation learning. We further evaluate the effectiveness of the technique
for inverse reinforcement learning, which recovers a reward function from demonstrations in or-
der to train future policies. Finally, we apply our framework to image generation using generative
adversarial networks, where employing VDB improves the performance in many cases.

RELATED WORK
Recent years have seen an explosion of adversarial learning techniques, spurred by the success of
generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). A GAN framework is commonly
composed of a discriminator and a generator, where the discriminator’s objective is to classify sam-
ples as real or fake, while the generator’s objective is to produce samples that fool the discriminator.
Similar frameworks have also been proposed for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) (Finn et al.,
2016b) and imitation learning (Ho & Ermon, 2016). The training of adversarial models can be ex-
tremely unstable, with one of the most prevalent challenges being balancing the interplay between
the discriminator and the generator (Berthelot et al., 2017). The discriminator can often overpower
the generator, easily differentiating between real and fake samples, thus providing the generator
with uninformative gradients for improvement (Che et al., 2016). Alternative loss functions have
been proposed to mitigate this problem (Mao et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Arjovsky et al., 2017).
Regularizers have been incorporated to improve stability and convergence, such as gradient penal-
ties (Kodali et al., 2017; Gulrajani et al., 2017a; Mescheder et al., 2018), reconstruction loss (Che
et al., 2016), and a myriad of other heuristics (Sønderby et al., 2016; Salimans et al., 2016; Arjovsky
& Bottou, 2017; Berthelot et al., 2017). Task-speciﬁc architectural designs can also substantially
improve performance (Radford et al., 2015; Karras et al., 2017). Similarly, our method also aims to
regularize the discriminator in order to improve the feedback provided to the generator. But instead
of explicit regularization of gradients or architecture-speciﬁc constraints, we apply a general infor-
mation bottleneck to the discriminator, which previous works have shown to encourage networks to
ignore irrelevant cues (Achille & Soatto, 2017). We hypothesize that this then allows the generator
to focus on improving the most discerning differences between real and fake samples.
Adversarial techniques have also been applied to inverse reinforcement learning (Fu et al., 2017),
where a reward function is recovered from demonstrations, which can then be used to train policies to
reproduce a desired skill. Finn et al. (2016a) showed an equivalence between maximum entropy IRL
and GANs. Similar techniques have been developed for adversarial imitation learning (Ho & Ermon,
2016; Merel et al., 2017), where agents learn to imitate demonstrations without explicitly recovering

a reward function. One advantage of adversarial methods is that by leveraging a discriminator in
place of a reward function, they can be applied to imitate skills where reward functions can be
difﬁcult to engineer. However, the performance of policies trained through adversarial methods still
falls short of those produced by manually designed reward functions, when such reward functions
are available (Rajeswaran et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2018). We show that our method can signiﬁcantly
improve upon previous works that use adversarial techniques, and produces results of comparable
quality to those from state-of-the-art approaches that utilize manually engineered reward functions.
Our variational discriminator bottleneck is based on the information bottleneck (Tishby & Za-
slavsky, 2015), a technique for regularizing internal representations to minimize the mutual informa-
tion with the input. Intuitively, a compressed representation can improve generalization by ignoring
irrelevant distractors present in the original input. The information bottleneck can be instantiated in
practical deep models by leveraging a variational bound and the reparameterization trick, inspired
by a similar approach in variational autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013). The resulting
variational information bottleneck approximates this compression effect in deep networks (Alemi
et al., 2016; Achille & Soatto, 2017). A similar bottleneck has also been applied to learn disentan-
gled representations (Higgins et al., 2017). Building on the success of VAEs and GANs, a number
of efforts have been made to combine the two. Makhzani et al. (2016) used adversarial discrimina-
tors during the training of VAEs to encourage the marginal distribution of the latent encoding to be
similar to the prior distribution, similar techniques include Mescheder et al. (2017) and Chen et al.
(2018). Conversely, Larsen et al. (2016) modeled the generator of a GAN using a VAE. Zhao et al.
(2016) used an autoencoder instead of a VAE to model the discriminator, but does not enforce an in-
formation bottleneck on the encoding. While instance noise is widely used in modern architectures
(Salimans et al., 2016; Sønderby et al., 2016; Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017), we show that explicitly
enforcing an information bottleneck leads to improved performance over simply adding noise for a
variety of applications.

PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we provide a review of the variational information bottleneck proposed by Alemi
et al. (2016) in the context of supervised learning. Our variational discriminator bottleneck is based
on the same principle, and can be instantiated in the context of GANs, inverse RL, and imitation
learning. Given a dataset {xi, yi}, with features xi and labels yi, the standard maximum likelihood
estimate q(yi|xi) can be determined according to
min
q
Ex,y∼p(x,y) [−log q(y|x)] .
(1)
Unfortunately, this estimate is prone to overﬁtting, and the resulting model can often exploit idiosyn-
crasies in the data (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014). Alemi et al. (2016) proposed
regularizing the model using an information bottleneck to encourage the model to focus only on the
most discriminative features. The bottleneck can be incorporated by ﬁrst introducing an encoder
E(z|x) that maps the features x to a latent distribution over Z, and then enforcing an upper bound
Ic on the mutual information between the encoding and the original features I(X, Z). This results
in the following regularized objective J(q, E)
J(q, E) = min
q,E
Ex,y∼p(x,y)

Ez∼E(z|x) [−log q(y|z)]

s.t.
I(X, Z) ≤Ic.
(2)
Note that the model q(y|z) now maps samples from the latent distribution z to the label y. The
mutual information is deﬁned according to
I(X, Z) =
Z
p(x, z) log p(x, z)
p(x)p(z) dx dz =
Z
p(x)E(z|x) logE(z|x)
p(z)
dx dz ,
(3)
where p(x) is the distribution given by the dataset.
Computing the marginal distribution
p(z) =
R
E(z|x) p(x) dx can be challenging. Instead, a variational lower bound can be obtained
by using an approximation r(z) of the marginal. Since KL [p(z)||r(z)] ≥0,
R
p(z) log p(z) dz ≥
R
p(z) log r(z) dz, an upper bound on I(X, Z) can be obtained via the KL divergence,
I(X, Z) ≤

p(x)E(z|x)logE(z|x)
r(z)
dx dz = Ex∼p(x) [KL [E(z|x)||r(z)]] .

VARIATIONAL DISCRIMINATOR BOTTLENECK
To outline our method, we ﬁrst consider a standard GAN framework consisting of a discriminator
D and a generator G, where the goal of the discriminator is to distinguish between samples from the
target distribution p∗(x) and samples from the generator G(x),
max
G min
D
Ex∼p∗(x) [−log (D(x))] + Ex∼G(x) [−log (1 −D(x))] .
We incorporate a variational information bottleneck by introducing an encoder E into the discrimi-
nator that maps a sample x to a stochastic encoding z ∼E(z|x), and then apply a constraint Ic on
the mutual information I(X, Z) between the original features and the encoding. D is then trained
to classify samples drawn from the encoder distribution. A schematic illustration of the framework
is available in Figure 2. The regularized objective J(D, E) for the discriminator is given by
J(D, E) = min

As we will discuss in Section 4.1 and demonstrate in our experiments, enforcing a speciﬁc mutual
information budget between x and z is critical for good performance. We therefore adaptively update
β via dual gradient descent to enforce a speciﬁc constraint Ic on the mutual information,

and αβ is the stepsize for the dual variable in dual gradient descent (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).
In practice, we perform only one gradient step on D and E, followed by an update to β. We refer to
a GAN that incorporates a VDB as a variational generative adversarial network (VGAN).
In our experiments, the prior r(z) = N(0, I) is modeled with a standard Gaussian. The encoder
E(z|x) = N(µE(x), ΣE(x)) models a Gaussian distribution in the latent variables Z, with mean
µE(x) and diagonal covariance matrix ΣE(x). When computing the KL loss, each batch of data
contains an equal number of samples from p∗(x) and G(x). We use a simpliﬁed objective for the
generator,
max
G
Ex∼G(x) [−log (1 −D(µE(x)))] .
(11)
where the KL penalty is excluded from the generator’s objective. Instead of computing the expecta-
tion over Z, we found that approximating the expectation by evaluating D at the mean µE(x) of the
encoder’s distribution was sufﬁcient for our tasks. The discriminator is modeled with a single linear
unit followed by a sigmoid D(z) = σ(wT
Dz + bD), with weights wD and bias bD.
4.1
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
To interpret the effects of the VDB, we consider the results presented by Arjovsky & Bottou (2017),
which show that for two distributions with disjoint support, the optimal discriminator can perfectly
classify all samples and its gradients will be zero almost everywhere. Thus, as the discriminator con-
verges to the optimum, the gradients for the generator vanishes accordingly. To address this issue,
Arjovsky & Bottou (2017) proposed applying continuous noise to the discriminator inputs, thereby
ensuring that the distributions have continuous support everywhere. In practice, if the original dis-
tributions are sufﬁciently distant from each other, the added noise will have negligible effects. As
shown by Mescheder et al. (2017), the optimal choice for the variance of the noise to ensure con-
vergence can be quite delicate. In our method, by ﬁrst using a learned encoder to map the inputs to
an embedding and then applying an information bottleneck on the embedding, we can dynamically
adjust the variance of the noise such that the distributions not only share support in the embedding
space, but also have signiﬁcant overlap. Since the minimum amount of information required for
binary classiﬁcation is 1 bit, by selecting an information constraint Ic < 1, the discriminator is pre-
vented from from perfectly differentiating between the distributions. To illustrate the effects of the
VDB, we consider a simple task of training a discriminator to differentiate between two Gaussian
distributions. Figure 2 visualizes the decision boundaries learned with different bounds Ic on the
mutual information. Without a VDB, the discriminator learns a sharp decision boundary, resulting in
vanishing gradients for much of the space. But as Ic decreases and the bound tightens, the decision
boundary is smoothed, providing more informative gradients that can be leveraged by the generator.
Taking this analysis further, we can extend Theorem 3.2 from Arjovsky & Bottou (2017) to analyze
the VDB, and show that the gradient of the generator will be non-degenerate for a small enough
constraint Ic, under some additional simplifying assumptions. The result in Arjovsky & Bottou
(2017) states that the gradient consists of vectors that point toward samples on the data manifold,
multiplied by coefﬁcients that depend on the noise. However, these coefﬁcients may be arbitrarily
small if the generated samples are far from real samples, and the noise is not large enough. This
can still cause the generator gradient to vanish. In the case of the VDB, the constraint ensures that
these coefﬁcients are always bounded below. Due to space constraints, this result is presented in
Appendix A.
4.2
VAIL: VARIATIONAL ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING
To extend the VDB to imitation learning, we start with the generative adversarial imitation learning
(GAIL) framework (Ho & Ermon, 2016), where the discriminator’s objective is to differentiate be-
tween the state distribution induced by a target policy π∗(s) and the state distribution of the agent’s
policy π(s),

range of skills from mocap data.
The discriminator is trained to maximize the likelihood assigned to states from the target policy,
while minimizing the likelihood assigned to states from the agent’s policy. The discriminator also
serves as the reward function for the agent, which encourages the policy to visit states that, to the
discriminator, appear indistinguishable from the demonstrations. Similar to the GAN framework,
we can incorporate a VDB into the discriminator,

where ˜π = 1
2π∗+ 1
2π represents a mixture of the target policy and the agent’s policy. The reward
for π is then speciﬁed by the discriminator rt = −log (1 −D(µE(s))). We refer to this method as
variational adversarial imitation learning (VAIL).
4.3
VAIRL: VARIATIONAL ADVERSARIAL INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
The VDB can also be applied to adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (Fu et al., 2017) to yield a
new algorithm which we call variational adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (VAIRL). AIRL
operates in a similar manner to GAIL, but with a discriminator of the form
D(s, a, s′) =
exp (f(s, a, s′))
exp (f(s, a, s′)) + π(a|s) ,
(13)
where f(s, a, s′) = g(s, a) + γh(s′) −h(s), with g and h being learned functions. Under certain
restrictions on the environment, Fu et al. show that if g(s, a) is deﬁned to depend only on the current
state s, the optimal g(s) recovers the expert’s true reward function r∗(s) up to a constant g∗(s) =
r∗(s) + const. In this case, the learned reward can be re-used to train policies in environments with
different dynamics, and will yield the same policy as if the policy was trained under the expert’s
true reward. In contrast, GAIL’s discriminator typically cannot be re-optimized in this way (Fu
et al., 2017). In VAIRL, we introduce stochastic encoders Eg(zg|s), Eh(zh|s), and g(zg), h(zh) are
modiﬁed to be functions of the encoding. We can reformulate Equation 13 as
D(s, a, z) =
exp (f(zg, zh, z′
h))
exp (f(zg, zh, z′
h)) + π(a|s) ,
for z = (zg, zh, z′
h) and f(zg, zh, z′
h) = Dg(zg) + γDh(z′
h) −Dh(zh). We then obtain a modiﬁed
objective of the form
J(D, E) = min

EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate our method on adversarial learning problems in imitation learning, inverse reinforce-
ment learning, and image generation. In the case of imitation learning, we show that the VDB
enables agents to learn complex motion skills from a single demonstration, including visual demon-
strations provided in the form of video clips. We also show that the VDB improves the performance
of inverse RL methods. Inverse RL aims to reconstruct a reward function from a set demonstrations,
which can then used to perform the task in new environments, in contrast to imitation learning,
which aims to recover a policy directly. Our method is also not limited to control tasks, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness for unconditional image generation.
5.1
VAIL: VARIATIONAL ADVERSARIAL IMITATION LEARNING
The goal of the motion imitation tasks is to train a simulated character to mimic demonstrations pro-
vided by mocap clips recorded from human actors. Each mocap clip provides a sequence of target
states {s∗
0, s∗
1, ..., s∗
T } that the character should track at each timestep. We use a similar experimental
setup as Peng et al. (2018), with a 34 degrees-of-freedom humanoid character. We found that the
discriminator architecture can greatly affect the performance on complex skills. The particular ar-
chitecture we employ differs substantially from those used in prior work (Merel et al., 2017), details
of which are available in Appendix C. The encoding Z is 128D and an information constraint of
Ic = 0.5 is applied for all skills, with a dual stepsize of αβ = 10−5. All policies are trained using
PPO (Schulman et al., 2017).
The motions learned by the policies are best seen in the supplementary video. Snapshots of the
character’s motions are shown in Figure 3. Each skill is learned from a single demonstration. VAIL
is able to closely reproduce a variety of skills, including those that involve highly dynamics ﬂips and
complex contacts. We compare VAIL to a number of other techniques, including state-only GAIL
(Ho & Ermon, 2016), GAIL with instance noise applied to the discriminator inputs (GAIL - noise),
GAIL with instance noise applied to the last hidden layer (GAIL - noise z), and GAIL with a gradient
penalty applied to the discriminator (GAIL - GP) (Mescheder et al., 2018). Since the VDB helps to
prevent vanishing gradients, while GP mitigates exploding gradients, the two techniques can be seen
as being complementary. Therefore, we also train a model that combines both VAIL and GP (VAIL -

GP). Implementation details for combining the VDB and GP are available in Appendix B. Learning
curves for the various methods are shown in Figure 10 and Table 1 summarizes the performance of
the ﬁnal policies. Performance is measured in terms of the average joint rotation error between the
simulated character and the reference motion. We also include a reimplementation of the method
described by Merel et al. (2017). For the purpose of our experiments, GAIL denotes policies trained
using our particular architecture but without a VDB, and Merel et al. (2017) denotes policies trained
using an architecture that closely mirror those from previous work. Furthermore, we include com-
parisons to policies trained using the handcrafted reward from Peng et al. (2018), as well as policies
trained via behavioral cloning (BC). Since mocap data does not provide expert actions, we use the
policies from Peng et al. (2018) as oracles to provide state-action demonstrations, which are then
used to train the BC policies via supervised learning. Each BC policy is trained with 10k samples
from the oracle policies, while all other policies are trained from just a single demonstration, the
equivalent of approximately 100 samples.
VAIL consistently outperforms previous adversarial methods, and VAIL - GP achieves the best per-
formance overall. Simply adding instance noise to the inputs (Salimans et al., 2016) or hidden layer
without the KL constraint (Sønderby et al., 2016) leads to worse performance, since the network can
learn a latent representation that renders the effects of the noise negligible. Though training with
the handcrafted reward still outperforms the adversarial methods, VAIL demonstrates comparable
performance to the handcrafted reward without manual reward or feature engineering, and produces
motions that closely resemble the original demonstrations. The method from Merel et al. (2017) was
able to imitate simple skills such as running, but was unable to reproduce more acrobatic skills such
as the backﬂip and spinkick. In the case of running, our implementation produces more natural gaits
than the results reported in Merel et al. (2017). Behavioral cloning is unable to reproduce any of the
skills, despite being provided with substantially more demonstration data than the other methods.
Video Imitation: While our method achieves substantially better results on motion imitation when
compared to prior work, previous methods can still produce reasonable behaviors. However, if the
demonstrations are provided in terms of the raw pixels from video clips, instead of mocap data,
the imitation task becomes substantially harder. The goal of the agent is therefore to directly im-

Figure 7: Left: C-Maze and S-Maze. When trained on the training maze on the left, AIRL learns
a reward that overﬁts to the training task, and which cannot be transferred to the mirrored maze on
the right. In contrast, VAIRL learns a smoother reward function that enables more-reliable transfer.

itate the skill depicted in the video. This is also a setting where manually engineering rewards is
impractical, since simple losses like pixel distance do not provide a semantically meaningful mea-
sure of similarity. Figure 6 compares learning curves of policies trained with VAIL, GAIL, and
policies trained using a reward function deﬁned by the average pixel-wise difference between the

rt = 1 −

Both GAIL and the pixel-loss are unable to learn the running gait. VAIL is the only method that
successfully learns to imitate the skill from the video demonstration. Snapshots of the video demon-
stration and the simulated motion is available in Figure 5. To further investigate the effects of the
VDB, we visualize the gradient of the discriminator with respect to images from the video demon-
stration and simulation. Saliency maps for discriminators trained with VAIL and GAIL are available
in Figure 5. The VAIL discriminator learns to attend to spatially coherent image patches around the
character, while the GAIL discriminator exhibits less structure. The magnitude of the gradients from
VAIL also tend to be signiﬁcantly larger than those from GAIL, which may suggests that VAIL is
able to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients present in GAIL.
Adaptive Constraint: To evaluate the effects of the adaptive β updates, we compare policies trained
with different ﬁxed values of β and policies where β is updated adaptively to enforce a desired
information constraint Ic = 0.5. Figure 6 illustrates the learning curves and the KL loss over the
course of training. When β is too small, performance reverts to that achieved by GAIL. Large values
of β help to smooth the discriminator landscape and improve learning speed during the early stages
of training, but converges to a worse performance. Policies trained using dual gradient descent to
adaptively update β consistently achieves the best performance overall.
5.2
VAIRL: VARIATIONAL ADVERSARIAL INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Next, we use VAIRL to recover reward functions from demonstrations. Unlike the discriminator
learned by VAIL, the reward function recovered by VAIRL can be re-optimized to train new policies
from scratch in the same environment. In some cases, it can also be used to transfer similar behaviour
to different environments. In Figure 7, we show the results of applying VAIRL to the C-maze from
Fu et al. (2017), and a more complex S-maze; the simple 2D observation spaces of these tasks
make it easy to interpret the recovered reward functions. In both mazes, the expert is trained to
navigate from a start position at the bottom of the maze to a ﬁxed target position at the top. We use
each method to obtain an imitation policy and to approximate the expert’s reward on the original
maze. The recovered reward is then used to train a new policy to solve a left–right ﬂipped version
of the training maze. On the C-maze, we found that plain AIRL—without a gradient penalty—
would sometimes overﬁt and fail to transfer to the new environment, as evidenced by the reward
visualization in Figure 7 (left) and the higher return variance in Figure 7 (right). In contrast, by
incorporating a VDB into AIRL, VAIRL learns a substantially smoother reward function that is
more suitable for transfer. Furthermore, we found that in the S-maze with two internal walls, AIRL
was too unstable to acquire a meaningful reward function. This was true even with the use of a
gradient penalty. In contrast, VAIRL was able to learn a reasonable reward in most cases without a

gradient penalty, and its performance improved even further with the addition of a gradient penalty.
To evaluate the effects of the VDB, we observe that the performance of VAIRL drops on both tasks
when the KL constraint is disabled (β = 0), suggesting that the improvements from the VDB cannot
be attributed entirely to the noise introduced by the sampling process for z. Further details of these
experiments and illustrations of the recovered reward functions are available in Appendix D.
5.3
VGAN: VARIATIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS
Finally, we apply the VDB to image generation with generative adversarial networks, which we
refer to as VGAN. Experiment are conducted on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al.), CelebA (Liu et al.
(2015)), and CelebAHQ (Karras et al., 2018) datasets. We compare our approach to recent stabi-
lization techniques: WGAN-GP (Gulrajani et al., 2017b), instance noise (Sønderby et al., 2016;
Arjovsky & Bottou, 2017), spectral normalization (SN) (Miyato et al., 2018), and gradient penalty
(GP) (Mescheder et al., 2018), as well as the original GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014) on CIFAR-
10. To measure performance, we report the Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al., 2017),
which has been shown to be more consistent with human evaluation. All methods are implemented
using the same base model, built on the resnet architecture of Mescheder et al. (2018). Aside from
tuning the KL constraint Ic for VGAN, no additional hyperparameter optimization was performed
to modify the settings provided by Mescheder et al. (2018). The performance of the various methods
on CIFAR-10 are shown in Figure 8. While vanilla GAN and instance noise are prone to diverging
as training progresses, VGAN remains stable. Note that instance noise can be seen as a non-adaptive
version of VGAN without constraints on Ic. This experiment again highlights that there is a signif-
icant improvement from imposing the information bottleneck over simply adding instance noise.
Combining both VDB and gradient penalty (VGAN - GP) achieves the best performance overall
with an FID of 18.1. We also experimented with combining the VDB with SN, but this combination
is prone to diverging. See Figure 9 for samples of images generated with our approach. Please refer
to Appendix E for experimental details and more results.

CONCLUSION
We present the variational discriminator bottleneck, a general regularization technique for adver-
sarial learning. Our experiments show that the VDB is broadly applicable to a variety of domains,
and yields signiﬁcant improvements over previous techniques on a number of challenging tasks.
While our experiments have produced promising results for video imitation, the results have been
primarily with videos of synthetic scenes. We believe that extending the technique to imitating real-
world videos is an exciting direction. Another exciting direction for future work is a more in-depth
theoretical analysis of the method, to derive convergence and stability results or conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
A
ANALYSIS AND PROOFS
In this appendix, we show that the gradient of the generator when the discriminator is augmented
with the VDB is non-degenerate, under some mild additional assumptions. First, we assume a
pointwise constraint of the form KL[E(z|x)∥r(z)] ≤Ic for all x. In reality, we use an average
KL constraint, since we found it to be more convenient to optimize, though a pointwise constraint
is also possible to enforce by using the largest constraint violation to increment β. We could likely
also extend the analysis to the average constraint, though we leave this to future work. The main
theorem can then be stated as follows:
Theorem A.1. Let g(u) denote the generator’s mapping from a noise vector u ∼p(u) to a point
in X. Given the generator distribution G(x) and data distribution p∗(x), a VDB with an encoder
E(z|x) = N(µE(x), Σ), and KL[E(z|x)∥r(z)] ≤Ic, the gradient passed to the generator has the
form
∇gEu∼p(u) [log (1 −D∗(µE(g(u))))]
= Eu∼p(u)

a(u)
Z
E(µE(g(u))|x)∇g||µE(g(u)) −µE(x)||2dp∗(x)
−b(u)
Z
E(µE(g(u))|x)∇g||µE(g(u)) −µE(x)||2dG(x)

where D∗(z) is the optimal discriminator, a(x) and b(x) are positive functions, and we always have
E(µE(g(u))|x) > C(Ic), where C(Ic) is a continuous monotonic function, and C(Ic) →δ > 0 as
Ic →0.
Analysis for an encoder with an input-dependent variance Σ(x) is also possible, but more involved.
We’ll further assume below for notational simplicity that Σ is diagonal with diagonal values σ2.
This assumption is not required, but substantially simpliﬁes the linear algebra. Analogously to
Theorem 3.2 from Arjovsky & Bottou (2017), this theorem states that the gradient of the generator
points in the direction of points in the data distribution, and away from points in the generator
distribution. However, going beyond the theorem in Arjovsky & Bottou (2017), this result states
that the coefﬁcients on these vectors, given by E(µE(g(u))|x), are always bounded below by a
value that approaches a positive constant δ as we decrease Ic, meaning that the gradient does not
vanish. The proof of the ﬁrst part of this theorem is essentially identical to the proof presented
by Arjovsky & Bottou (2017), but accounting for the fact that the noise is now injected into the
latent space of the VDB, rather than being added directly to x. This result assumes that E(z|x)
has a learned but input-independent variance Σ = σ2I, though the proof can be repeated for an
input-dependent or non-diagonal Σ:
Proof. Overloading p∗(x) and G(x), let p∗(z) and G(z) be the distribution of embeddings z under
the real data and generator respectively. p∗(z) is then given by
p∗(z) = Ex∼p∗(x) [E(z|x)] =
Z
E(z|x)dp∗(x),
and similarly for G(z)
G(z) = Ex∼G(x) [E(z|x)] =

Similar to the result from Arjovsky & Bottou (2017), the gradient of the generator drives the gener-
ator’s samples in the embedding space µE(g(u)) towards embeddings of the points from the dataset
µE(x) weighted by their likelihood E(µE(g(u))|x) under the real data. For an arbitrary encoder E,
real and fake samples in the embedding may be far apart. As such, the coefﬁcients E(µE(g(u))|x)
can be arbitrarily small, thereby resulting in vanishing gradients for the generator.
The second part of the theorem states that C(Ic) is a continuous monotonic function, and
C(Ic) →δ > 0 as Ic →0. This is the main result, and relies on the fact that KL[E(z|x)||r(z)] ≤Ic.
The intuition behind this result is that, for any two inputs x and y, their encoded distributions E(z|x)
and E(z|y) have means that cannot be more than some distance apart, and that distance shrinks with
Ic. This allows us to bound E(µE(y))|x) below by C(Ic), which ensures that the coefﬁcients on
the vectors in the theorem above are always at least as large as C(Ic).

Proof. Let r(z) = N(0, I) be the prior distribution and suppose the KL divergence for all x in the
dataset and all g(u) generated by the generator are bounded by Ic
KL [E(z|x)||r(z)] ≤Ic,
∀x, x ∼p∗(x)
KL [E(z|g(u))||r(z)] ≤Ic,
∀u, u ∼p(u).
From the deﬁnition of the KL-divergence we can bound the length of all embedding vectors,
KL [E(z|x)||r(z)] = 1

||µE(x)||2 ≤2Ic −Kσ2 + K + K log σ2,
and similarly for ||µE(g(u))||2, with K denoting the dimension of Z.
A lower bound on
E(µE(g(u))|x), where u ∼p(u) and x ∼p∗(x), can then be determined by
log (E(µE(g(u))|x)) = −1

Since ||µE(x)||2, ||µE(g(u))||2 ≤2Ic −Kσ2 + K + K log σ2,
||µE(g(u)) −µE(x)||2 ≤8Ic −4Kσ2 + 4K + 4K log σ2,
and it follows that

2σ2 (µE(g(u)) −µE(x))T (µE(g(u)) −µE(x)) ≥−4σ−2Ic + 2K −2Kσ−2 −2Kσ−2 log σ−2.
The likelihood is therefore bounded below by

GRADIENT PENALTY
To combine VDB with gradient penalty, we use the reparameterization trick to backprop through the
encoder when computing the gradient of the discriminator with respect to the inputs.

The coefﬁcient wGP weights the gradient penalty in the objective, wGP = 10 for the image gen-
eration, wGP = 1 for motion imitation, and wGP = 0.1 (C-maze) or wGP = 0.01 (S-maze) for
the IRL tasks. The gradient penalty is applied only to real samples p∗(x). We have experimented
with apply the penalty to both real and fake samples, but found that performance was worse than
penalizing only gradients from real samples. This is consistent with the GP implementation from
Mescheder et al. (2018).
C
IMITATION LEARNING
Experimental Setup: The goal of the motion imitation tasks is to train a simulated agent to mimic a
demonstration provided in the form of a mocap clip recorded from a human actor. We use a similar
experimental setup as Peng et al. (2018), with a 34 degrees-of-freedom humanoid character. The
state s consists of features that represent the conﬁguration of the character’s body (link positions
and velocities). We also include a phase variable φ ∈[0, 1] among the state features, which records
the character’s progress along the motion and helps to synchronize the character with the reference
motion. With 0 and 1 denoting the start and end of the motion respectively. The action a sampled
from the policy π(a|s) speciﬁes target poses for PD controller positioned at each joint. Given a
state, the policy speciﬁes a Gaussian distribution over the action space π(a|s) = N(µ(s), Σ), with
a state-dependent mean µ(s) and ﬁxed diagonal covariance matrix Σ. µ(s) is modeled using a 3-
layered fully-connected network with 1024 and 512 hidden units, followed by a linear output layer
that speciﬁes the mean of the Gaussian. ReLU activations are used for all hidden layers. The value
function is modeled with a similar architecture but with a single linear output unit. The policy is
queried at 30Hz. Physics simulation is performed at 1.2kHz using the Bullet physics engine Bullet
(2015).
Given the rewards from the discriminator, PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) is used to train the policy,
with a stepsize of 2.5 × 10−6 for the policy, a stepsize of 0.01 for the value function, and a stepsize
of 10−5 for the discirminator. Gradient descent with momentum 0.9 is used for all models. The
PPO clipping threshold is set to 0.2. When evaluating the performance of the policies, each episode
is simulated for a maximum horizon of 20s. Early termination is triggered whenever the character’s
torso contacts the ground, leaving the policy is a maximum error of π radians for all remaining
timesteps.
Phase-Functioned Discriminator: Unlike the policy and value function, which are modeled with
standard fully-connected networks, the discriminator is modeled by a phase-functioned neural net-
work (PFNN) to explicitly model the time-dependency of the reference motion (Holden et al., 2017).
While the parameters of a network are generally ﬁxed, the parameters of a PFNN are functions of
the phase variable φ. The parameters θ of the network for a given φ is determined by a weighted
combination of a set of ﬁxed parameters {θ0, θ1, ..., θk},
θ =
k
X
i=0
wi(φ) θi ,
where wi(φ) is a phase-dependent weight for θi. In our implementation, we use k = 5 sets of
parameters and wi(φ) is designed to linearly interpolate between two adjacent sets of parameters
for each phase φ, where each set of parameters θi corresponds to a discrete phase value φi spaced

is measured using the average joint rotation error between the simulated character and the reference

uniformly between [0, 1]. For a given value of φ, the parameters of the discriminator are determined
according to
θ = wi(φ)θi + wi+1(φ)θi+1
where θi and θi+1 correspond to the phase values φi ≤φ < φi+1 that form the endpoints of
the phase interval that contains φ. A PFNN is used for all motion imitation experiments, both
VAIL and GAIL, except for those that use the approach proposed by Merel et al. (2017), which use
standard fully-connected networks for the discriminator. Figure 11 compares the performance of
VAIL when the discriminator is modeled with a phase-functioned neural network (with PFNN) to
discriminators modeled with standard fully-connected networks. We increased the size of the layers
of the fully-connected nets to have a similar number of parameters as a PFNN. We evaluate the
performance of fully-connected nets that receive the phase variable φ as part of the input (no PFNN),
and fully-connected nets that do not receive φ as an input. The phase-functioned discriminator
leads to signiﬁcant performance improvements across all tasks evaluated. Policies trained without a
phase variable performs worst overall, suggesting that phase information is critical for performance.
All methods perform well on simpler skills, such as running, but the additional phase structure
introduced by the PFNN proved to be vital for successful imitation of more complex skills, such as
the dance and backﬂip.
Next we compare the accuracy of discriminators trained using different methods. Figure 12 illus-
trates accuracy of the discriminators over the course of training. Discriminators trained via GAIL
quickly overpowers the policy, and learns to accurately differentiate between samples, even when

instance noise is applied to the inputs. VAIL without the KL constraint slows the discriminator’s
progress, but nonetheless reaches near perfect accuracy with a larger number of samples. Once the
KL constraint is enforced, the information bottleneck constrains the performance of the discrimina-
tor, converging to approximately 80% accuracy. Figure 12 also visualizes the value of β over the
course of training for motion imitation tasks, along with the loss of the KL term in the objective.
The dual gradient descent update effectively enforces the VDB constraint Ic.
Video Imitation: In the video imitation tasks, we use a simpliﬁed 2D biped character in order to
avoid issues that may arise due to depth ambiguity from monocular videos. The biped character
has a total of 12 degrees-of-freedom, with similar state and action parameters as the humanoid.
The video demonstrations are generated by rendering a reference motion into a sequence of video
frames, which are then provided to the agent as a demonstration. The goal of the agent is to imitate
the motion depicted in the video, without access to the original reference motion, and the reference
motion is used only to evaluate performance.

INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
D.1
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Environments
We evaluate on two maze tasks, as illustrated in Figure 13. The C-maze is taken
from Fu et al. (2017): in this maze, the agent starts at a random point within a small ﬁxed distance
of the mean start position. The agent has a continuous, 2D action space which allows it to accelerate
in the x or y directions, and is able to observe its x and y position, but not its velocity. The ground
truth reward is rt = −dt −10−3∥at∥2, where dt is the agent’s distance to the goal, and at is its
action (this action penalty is assumed to be zero in Figure 13). Episodes terminate after 100 steps;
for evaluation, we report the undiscounted mean sum of rewards over each episode The S-maze is
larger variant of the same environment with an extra wall between the agent and its goal. To make
the S-maze easier to solve for the expert, we increased the maximum control forces relative to the
C-maze to enable more rapid exploration. Environments will be released along with the rest of our
VAIRL implementations.
Hyperparameters
Policy networks for all methods were two-layer ReLU MLPs with 32 hidden
units per layer. Reward and discriminator networks were similar, but with 32-unit mean and standard
deviation layers inserted before the ﬁnal layer for VDB methods. To generate expert demonstrations,
we trained a TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) agent on the ground truth reward for the training envi-
ronment for 200 iterations, and saved 107 trajectories from each of the policies corresponding to the
ﬁve ﬁnal iterations. TRPO used a batch size of 10,000, a step size of 0.01, and entropy bonus with
a coefﬁcient of 0.1 to increase diversity. After generating demonstrations, we trained the IRL and
imitation methods on a training maze for 200 iterations; again, our policy optimizer was TRPO with
the same hyperparameters used to generate demonstrations. Between each policy update, we did
100 discriminator updates using Adam with a learning rate of 5 × 10−5 and batch size of 32. For
the C-maze our VAIRL runs used a target KL of IC = 0.5, while for the more complex S-maze we
use a tighter target of IC = 0.05. For the test C-maze, we trained new policies against the recovered

reward using TRPO with the hyperparameters described above; for the test S-maze, we modiﬁed
these parameters to use a batch size of 50,000 and learning rate of 0.001 for 400 iterations.
D.2
RECOVERED REWARD FUNCTIONS
Figure 14 and 15 show the reward functions recovered by each IRL baseline on the C-maze and
S-maze, respectively, along with sample trajectories for policies trained to optimize those rewards.
Notice that VAIRL tends to recover smoother reward functions that match the ground truth reward
more closely than the baselines. Addition of a gradient penalty enhances this effect for both AIRL
and VAIRL. This is especially true in S-maze, where combining a gradient penalty with a variational
discriminator bottleneck leads to a smooth reward that gradually increases as the agent nears its goal
position at the top of the maze.
E
IMAGE GENERATION
We provide further experiment on image generation and details of the experimental setup.
E.1
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
We use the non-saturating objective of Goodfellow et al. (2014) for all models except WGAN-
GP. Following (Lucic et al., 2017), we compute FID on samples of size 100002. We base our
implementation on (Mescheder et al., 2018), where we do not use any batch normalization for both
the generator and the discriminator. We use RMSprop (Hinton et al.) and a ﬁxed learning rate for
all experiments.
For convolutional GAN, variational discriminative bottleneck is implemented as a 1x1 convolution
on the ﬁnal embedding space that outputs a Gaussian distribution over Z parametrized with a mean
and a diagonal covariance matrix. For all image experiments, we preserve the dimensionality of
the latent space. All experiments use adaptive β update with a dual stepsize of αβ = 10−5. We
will make our code public. Similarly to VGAN, instance noise Sønderby et al. (2016); Arjovsky
& Bottou (2017) is added to the ﬁnal embedding space of the discriminator right before applying
the classiﬁer. Instance noise can be interpreted as a non-adaptive VGAN without a information
constraint.
Architecture:
For CIFAR-10, we use a resnet-based architecture adapted from (Mescheder et al.,
2018) detailed in Tables 2, 3, and 4. For CelebA and CelebAHQ, we use the same architecture used
in (Mescheder et al., 2018).

networks at 750k iterations. We use Ic = 0.1, and a coefﬁcient of wGP = 10 for the gradient
penalty, which is the same as the value used by the implementation from Mescheder et al. (2018).
See Figure 16 for visual comparisons of randomly generated samples.
CelebA:
On the CelebA (Liu et al., 2015) dataset, we generate images of size 128 × 128 with
Ic = 0.2. On this dataset we do not see a big improvement upon the other baselines. This is likely
because the architecture has been effectively tuned for this task, reﬂected by the fact that even the
vanilla GAN trains ﬁne on this dataset. All GAN, GP, and VGAN-GP obtain a similar FID scores
of 7.64, 7.76, 7.25 respectively. See Figure 17 for more qualitative results with our approach.
CelebAHQ:
VGAN can also be trained on on CelebAHQ Karras et al. (2018) at 1024 by 1024
resolution directly, without progressive growing (Karras et al., 2018). We use Ic = 0.1 and train
with VGAN-GP. We train on a single Tesla V100, which ﬁts a batch size of 8 in our experiments.
Previous approaches (Karras et al., 2018; Mescheder et al., 2018) use a larger batch size and train
over multiple GPUs. The model was trained for 300k iterations.
