Abstract
In the theoretical framework described in this thesis, attention is part of the inference pro-
cess that solves the visual recognition problem of what is where. The theory proposes a
computational role for attention and leads to a model that predicts some of its main prop-
erties at the level of psychophysics and physiology. In our approach, the main goal of
the visual system is to infer the identity and the position of objects in visual scenes: spa-
tial attention emerges as a strategy to reduce the uncertainty in shape information while
feature-based attention reduces the uncertainty in spatial information. Featural and spatial
attention represent two distinct modes of a computational process solving the problem of
recognizing and localizing objects, especially in difficult recognition tasks such as in clut-
tered natural scenes. We describe a specific computational model and relate it to the known
functional anatomy of attention. We show that several well-known attentional phenom-
ena - including bottom-up pop-out effects, multiplicative modulation of neuronal tuning
curves and shift in contrast responses - emerge naturally as predictions of the model. We
also show that the bayesian model predicts well human eye fixations (considered as a proxy
for shifts of attention) in natural scenes. Finally, we demonstrate that the same model, used
to modulate information in an existing feedforward model of the ventral stream, improves
its object recognition performance in clutter.

Left: Efficient vs. inefficient searches: When a stimulus differs from the back-
ground in a single dimension (first and second column) search is easy (indicated
by a high contrast saliency map) and independent of the number of distractors.
However, when features are shared between the target and distractors (third col-
umn), search is more difficult (indicated by a low contrast saliency map). Right:
Object recognition in clutter consists of feature-based attention followed by spatial
attention. The most likely location of the target is found by feature-based attention
by setting appropriately the feature priors (middle column). The hypothesis is then
verified by deploying spatial attention around the location of the highest saliency
(the spatial priors are changed in the right column). The value of the feature units
P(F|I) indicate the presence or absence of an object feature.

within the ventral stream (providing feature-based attention); (ii) the cortical feed-
back from areas of the parietal cortex onto areas of the ventral stream (provid-
ing spatial attention) and, (iii) feedforward connections to the parietal cortex that
serves as a 'saliency map' encoding the visual relevance of image locations (Koch

Spatial and feature attention re-interpreted using message passing within the model.
Spatial attention: (a) Each feature unit F1 pools across all locations from the cor-
responding X' unit. (b) Spatial attention here solves the 'clutter' problem by
concentrating the prior P(L) around a region of interest (the attentional spotlight,
marked 'X') via a message passed between the L nodes in the 'where' stream and
the X' nodes in the 'what' stream. (c) Following this message passing, the fea-
ture within the spotlight can be read out from the posterior probability P(F|I).
Feature-based attention (d) Each location represented in the L unit output from all
features at the same location. (e) Feature attention can be deployed by altering the
priors P(Fi) such that P(Fi) is high for the preferred feature and low for the rest.
The message passing effectively enhances the preferred features at all locations
while suppressing other features from distracting objects. (f) The location of the
preferred feature can be read out from the posterior probability P(L II). . . . . . .

Chapter 1
Introduction

1.1 
Motivation
Much of the recent work in visual recognition both in computer vision and physiology
focused on the 'what' problem: which object is in the image. Face detection and identi-
fication are typical examples. Recognition is, however, more than the mere detection of
a specific object or object class: everyday vision solves routinely the problem of what is
where. In fact, David Marr defined vision as "knowing what is where by seeing" (Marr,
1982).
In somewhat of an oversimplification, it has been customary to describe processing of
visual information in the brain along two parallel and concurrent streams. The ventral
('what') stream processes visual shape appearance and is largely responsible for object
recognition. The dorsal ('where') stream encodes spatial locations and processes motion
information. In an extreme version of this view, the two streams underlie the perception of
'what' and 'where' concurrently and relatively independently of each other (Ungerleider
and Mishkin, 1982; Ungerleider and Haxby, 1994). Lesions in a key area of the ventral
('what') stream (the inferior temporal cortex) cause severe deficits in visual discrimination
tasks without affecting performance on visuospatial tasks such as visually guided reaching
tasks or tasks that involve judgments of proximity. In contrast, parietal lesions in the dorsal
('where') stream cause severe deficits on visuospatial performance tasks while sparing vi-
sual discrimination ability. In everyday life, the identity and location of objects must some-
how be integrated to enable us to direct appropriate actions to objects. Thus a hypothetical
segregation of the two streams raises the question of how the visual system combines in-
formation about the identities of objects and their locations. The central thesis of this work
is that visual attention performs this computation (see also (Van Der Velde and De Kamps,
2001; Deco and Rolls, 2004a)).
However, explaining the role of attention is but a small part of understanding visual atten-
tion in the brain. The past four decades of research in visual neuroscience have generated a
large and disparate body of literature on attention. Several theoretical proposals and compu-
tational models have been described to try to explain the main functional and computational
role of visual attention. One important proposal by Tsotsos (1997) is that attention reflects

evolution's attempt to fix the processing bottleneck in the visual system (Broadbent, 1958)
by directing the finite computational capacity of the visual system preferentially to relevant
stimuli within the visual field while ignoring everything else. Treisman and Gelade (1980)
suggested that attention is used to bind different features (e.g. color and form) of an object
during visual perception. Duncan (1995) suggested that the goal of attention is to bias the
choice between competing stimuli within the visual field. These proposals however remain
agnostic about how attention should be implemented in the visual cortex and do not yield
any prediction about the various behavioral and physiological effects of attention.
On the other hand, computational models attempt to model specific behavioral and physio-
logical effects of attention. Behavioral effects include pop-out of salient objects (Itti et al.,
1998; Zhang et al., 2008; Rosenholtz and Mansfield, 2005), top-down bias of target fea-
tures (Wolfe, 2007; Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006), influence from scene context (Torralba,
2003b), serial vs. parallel-search effect (Wolfe, 2007) etc. Physiological effects include
multiplicative modulation of neuron response under spatial attention (Rao, 2005) and fea-
ture based attention (Bichot et al., 2005). A unifying framework that provides a computa-
tional goal for attention and at the same time accounts for the disparate effects listed above
is missing.
1.2 
Our contributions
We present a theory where attention is part of the inference process that determines "what"
is "where" in the visual scene. Based on the theory and a few assumptions, we derive a
computational model that can be mapped to the anatomy of attentional processing in the
brain. Finally, we validate the model experimentally and show that it is consistent with
physiological effects and human behavior. In the following, we list our specific contribu-
tions.
1.2.1 
Theory
e Recently, it has been suggested that visual perception can be interpreted as a bayesian
inference process where top-down signals are used to disambiguate noisy bottom-up

sensory input signals (Mumford, 1992; Dayan et al., 1995; Knill and Richards, 1996;
Dayan and Zemel, 1999; Weiss et al., 2002; Rao et al., 2002a; Rao, 2004; Lee and Mum-
ford, 2003; Kersten and Yuille, 2003a; Kersten et al., 2004; Friston, 2003; George and
Hawkins, 2005; Dean, 2005; Murray and Kreutz-Delgado, 2007; Hinton, 2007; Epshtein
et al., 2008). Extending this idea, we propose that attention can also be regarded as
an inference process that disambiguates form and location information (Yu and Dayan,
2005; Rao, 2005).
" In the theoretical framework proposed here, we suggest that attention is part of the visual
inference process that solves the problem of what is where. Spatial attention emerges as
a strategy to reduce the uncertainty in shape information while feature-based attention
reduces the uncertainty in spatial information. Feature-based and spatial attention repre-
sent two distinct modes of a computational process solving the problem of recognizing
and localizing objects, especially in difficult recognition tasks such as in cluttered natu-
ral scenes. The theory explains attention not as a primary mechanism (or a visual routine
(Ullman, 1984)), but as an effect of interaction between the 'what' and 'where' streams
within this inference framework.
" Conceptual models or theories of attention proposed so far explain the role of attention,
but not how it is implemented in the brain. Computational models, on the other hand are
far removed from how attention works in the brain. Phenomenological models explain
individual physiological phenomena in the brain but do not explain the role of attention
in the broader scheme of visual perception. The proposed work bridges the gap between
conceptual, computational and phenomenological models of attention. The theory pro-
poses a computational role for attention and leads to a model that predicts some of its
main properties at the level of psychophysics and physiology.
1.2.2 
Computational model of attention
e Starting from a bayesian view of visual perception and assumptions motivated by sam-
ple complexity and biology, we derive a specific computational model and relate it to
the known anatomy of attention. In the model, visual perception is viewed as infer-

ence of object location and identity given an image. Top-down spatial and feature-based
attention can be interpreted as priors/biases that are set before the image is presented.
The posterior probability of location serves as a saliency map that predicts where the
attentional spotlight is shifted next.
" The model mimics attentional processing in the brain both in terms of structure as well as
behaviour. Within this generative model, the object's identity and location are modelled
as being marginally independent. This mimics the separation of 'what' (ventral) and
'where' (dorsal) streams in the human visual system. This segregation raises the question
of how object location and identity are tied together during perception. In the proposed
model, the interaction between location and identity information occurs through hidden
variables that encode positions of individual features. This is similar to regions in the
brain (such as V4) that mediate interactions between ventral and dorsal streams.
" The computational model is closely related to the bayesian model of spatial attention pro-
posed by Rao (2005). Here, we significantly extend the model to include feature-based
attention in addition to spatial attention. Prior work modelled a single feature dimension
with mutually exclusive features. On the other hand, we model conjunction of features
that share a common spatial modulation allowing us to model complex search tasks. In
addition to reproducing classical results on simple stimuli, we show applications of the
model on complex real-world stimuli.
" We show that the bayesian model is also consistent (and in fact equivalent) with phe-
nomenological models such as the normalization model of attention (Reynolds and Heeger,
2009) that can explain several (even conflicting) physiological effects of attention. In
contrast to phenomenological models that are designed to mimic biological phenomena,
we show that the same phenomena emerge naturally as 'predictions' of the model.
" We show that the model exhibits properties consistent with experimental evidence from
physiology such as:
1. Spatial invariance: The response of the model units that encode features are invari-
ant to position of the feature within the image. This property is consistent with

position invariant neurons found in region IT of the ventral stream.
2. Multiplicative modulation: The response of the model units that jointly encode
position and feature are modulated under spatial and feature-based attention. This
is consistent with region V4 where neuron activities are modulated under attention
(McAdams and Maunsell, 1999; Reynolds et al., 1999, 2000; Bichot et al., 2005).
3. Shift in contrast response: It was shown that attention can shift the contrast re-
sponse curve of neurons (Martinez-Trujillo and Treue, 2002; Reynolds et al., 2000).
Other experiments (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999; Treue and Trujillo, 1999a) re-
ported a mulitiplicative gain. Reynolds and Heeger (2009) reconciled these contra-
dictory observations using a normalization model of attention. We show that our
model is consistent with both of these experiments.
4. Visual pop-out effect: Psychophysics has shown that parts of an image that are
distinct from rest of the image in any feature dimension 'pops-out' and attracts
attention independent of the search task. Computational models proposed so far
compute an explicit measure of this difference to simulate pop-out (Itti et al., 1998;
Gao and Vasconcelos, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008; Rosenholtz, 1985). In contrast,
pop-out effect emerges as a natural consequence ('prediction') of our model.
* The model we propose is general in the choice of features used. Using oriented features,
the model can reproduce attentional effects found in area V4 as discussed before. When
extended to motion features, the model can reproduce attentional effects found in area
MT (a region in the dorsal stream that processes motion information) (Treue and Trujillo,
1999b; Beauchamp et al., 1997). Using a combination of color and motion features, we
can also explain the interaction between these features (Womelsdorf et al., 2006) that
has not been modelled before. Finally, when we use complex shape-based features, we
show that the model can predict human eye movements on complex real world images.
1.2.3 
Experimental validation of the model
* We test the model on complex real world images through two specific experiments: (i)
We show that the model predicts well human eye fixations in natural scenes. (ii) We

demonstrate that the same model, used to modulate information in an existing feedfor-
ward model of the ventral stream, improves its object recognition performance in clutter.
Modeling eye movements: Human eye movements can be considered as a proxy for
shifts of attention. Also, modeling eye movements has been shown to be useful in
priming object detection (Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006; Torralba, 2003a), pruning in-
terest points (Rutishauser et al., 2004) and quantifying visual clutter (Rosenholtz and
Mansfield, 2005). Previous work in attention and eye movements has focused on free
viewing conditions (Itti and Koch, 2001a; Parkhurst et al., 2002; Peters et al., 2005;
Bruce and Tsotsos, 2006) where attention is driven by purely bottom-up information.
In reality, top-down effects from the search task can heavily influence attention and eye
movements(Yarbus, 1967). In this work, we outline a visual attention model where spa-
tial priors imposed by the scene and the feature priors imposed by the target object are
combined in a Bayesian framework to generate a task-dependent saliency map. In the
absence of task-dependent priors, the model operates in a purely bottom-up fashion.
* Object recognition in clutter: The human visual system can recognize several thou-
sand object categories irrespective of their position and size (over some finite range).
This combination of selectivity and invariance is achieved by pooling responses from
afferents in the previous stage. The cost of this tolerance to position and scale transfor-
mations is susceptibility to crowding and clutter. When multiple objects or background
clutter are present simultaneously within the receptive field of a neuron, the stimuli com-
pete with each other for representation at a higher layer. This effect has been observed
in all stages of the visual processing (Reynolds et al., 1999; Zoccolan et al., 2007), hu-
man psychophysics as well as computational models (Serre et al., 2007a). A natural
hypothesis - that we adopt here - is that an attentional spotlight may be used to suppress
responses from distracting stimulus while enhancing those of the target stimulus.

1.3 
Outline
The rest of this thesis is organized as follows. In chapter 2, we provide details about our
computational model and describe a tentative mapping to biology. In addition, we illustrate
the properties of the model, both designed and emergent. In chapter 3, we show that the
model can "predict" physiological effects of attention. In chapter 4, we use the model
to predict human eye movements on complex real world images. In chapter 5, we show
that feature-based and spatial attention can be used in conjunction to recognize objects in
cluttered visual scenes. We demonstrate that the model can explain improvement in object
recognition performance under the influence of attention. Finally in chapter 6, we discuss
the limitations of the model and future directions of research.

Chapter 2
Computational framework

2.1 
Model preliminaries
A generative model S -4 I specifies how an image I (represented as either raw pixel inten-
sities or as a collection of topographic feature maps) is determined by the scene description
S (e.g., vectorial description of properties such as global illumination, scene identity, ob-
jects present etc.). The product of the likelihood P(IIS) and the prior probability of the
scene description P(S) determines the generative model (Kersten et al., 2004):
P(S, I) = P(IIS)P(S). 
(2.1)
The generative model also specifies the probabilistic relationship between observed vari-
ables (object, image) and unobserved (latent) variables such as lighting, depth, viewpoint
etc. that influence the observed data. Following recent work (Kersten and Yuille, 2003b),
we decompose the description of a scene in n components which in our case are just objects
(including the background) {O1, 02,.- , On} and their locations {L 1, L 2 ,.- 
, Ln} in the
scene
Thus, S = {01, 02,-- 
,QO, 
L1, L2 , ... 
, Ln}. In the most general case, every random
variable influences every other one. We show how a few key assumptions lead to a simple
factorization of the generally complex joint probability - corresponding to simplifications
of the original graphical model. As we mentioned, one of the main tasks of vision is to
recognize and localize objects in the scene. Here we assume that
(a) to achieve this goal, the visual system selects and localizes objects, one object at a time.
Since the requirements of the task split S into those variables that are important to es-
timate accurately for the task and those that are not, we write in this case P(S, I) =
P(0 1, L1, 02, L2 , ... , On, Ln, I). We can then integrate out the confounding variables
(i.e., all objects except one - labeled, without loss in generality, 01):
P(0
1, L 1, I) = 
P(0
1, L1, 0 2 ... , On, L2, .. 
, LI). 
(2.2)
02.. OnL 2---Ln
We further assume that
'The probabilistic model can be extended to generalize to scenes with an arbitrary number of objects.

(b) the object location and object identity are independent, leading to the following factor-
ization:
P(0, L, I) = P(O)P(L)P(IL, 0). 
(2.3)
In Eq. 2.3 and in following equations, we replace, for simplicity the single object 01 with
0 and its location L1 with L.
Remarks
" Attention, as described later, emerges as the inference process implied by Eq. 2.3.
In a sense, our framework with the key assumption (a), "predicts" attention and -
with the approximations to Eq. 2.3 described in the rest of the section - several of its
properties.
" Bayesian models of object recognition - but, emphatically, not of attention - assume
different (wrt Eq.2.3) factorizations of P(S, I), such as P(S, I) = P(0 1, L1, --- , O, Ln, I)
(Sudderth et al., 2005) or P(S, I) = P(0, L, I) = P(0, L 1I)P(I) (Torralba, 2003a),
in which location and identity of an object are modeled jointly. In Eq. 2.3, I corre-
sponds to an entire array of measurements (every feature at every location). Eq. 2.3,
dictated by the generative model and the requirements of the task, leads to a simpler
approximation with P(0, L, I) = P(O)P(L)P(II0, L) - as a model of attention.
" The key assumption (a) characterizes the task of attention as selecting a single ob-
ject - for recognition and localization - in the scene. This is a formalization of the
standard spotlight hypothesis of attention, in which attention focuses processing to a
region of the image. One can speculate about the reasons for this constraint. Previ-
ous proposals based on the bottleneck and salience hypotheses (Tsotsos, 1997; Bruce
and Tsotsos, 2006; Itti et al., 1998) postulate that the role of attention is to priori-
tize the visual scene, where limited visual processing resources are directed towards
'relevant' regions. These hypotheses correspond to the assumption that the visual
system needs attention in order to reduce the computational complexity of recogni-
tion. We prefer a related hypothesis to justify attention and our factorization. Our
hypothesis is that attention is needed to reduce the sample complexity of learning the

relevant probability distributions over objects, features and locations . We believe
that it would take too much data, and therefore an unreasonably long time, unless
one makes assumptions about the parametric form of the distributions - assumptions
that are arguably as strong as ours.
Let us assume that e is the error with which the non-parameteric distribution is
learned, s is a measure of smoothness of the density being approximated, N is the
number of objects, 0 is the number of object classes and L is the dimensionality
of the location grid. As an example to give a feeling for the issue, we consider the
joint probabilities: Learning joint probabilities of all the N objects and their locations
would take in the order of e-NOL/s examples where learning a single object and its
location would take in the order of e-OL/s examples whereas it would take in the
order of e-O/s + E-L/s examples for our factorization. There can be many orders of
magnitude difference between the required examples (for instance take C = 0.1)!
* Eq. 2.3 is not a strong generative model (Kersten et al., 2004) because it takes into
account a generative model and the assumed constraints of the task of attention. It
cannot produce images containing many objects, such as typical scenes used in our
experiments (see for instance Fig 2-5). It can synthesize images containing either no
object or one object such as a single car. It corresponds to visual scenes 'illuminated
by a spotlight of attention'. Notice that from the inference point of view, if the task
is to find a car in the image, there will always be either no car or one car which is
more car-like than other ones (because of image "noise").
* Although, assumption (a) posits that the core model of attention should find a single
object in the image, the process can be iterated, looking for other objects in other
locations, one at a time. This assumption motivates most (extended) models of atten-
tion (Miau and Itti, 2001; Rutishauser et al., 2004; Walther and Koch, 2007) and also
motivates mechanisms such as "inhibiton of return" (Itti and Koch, 2001a). The full
strategy of calling multiple times the core attention module to recognize and localize
one object at a time is not bayesian. It is an interesting question for future work how
to model in a fully bayesian framework the sequential process of recognizing and

localizing objects (Monahan, 1982; Smallwood and Sondik, 1973; Lovejoy, 1991).
2.1.1 
Model
Consider the generative model specified in Eq. 2.3. We assume that the image of an ob-
ject is generated through a set of relatively complex object features. In particular, (c) we
assume that each of N features is either present or absent and that they are condition-
ally independent, given the object and its location. A similar approach can be found in
other part-based object recognition frameworks (Crandall et al., 2005; Felzenszwalb and
Huttenlocher, 2005; Fergus et al., 2003).
We use intermediate latent variables {X1, X2,... , XN} to encode the position of the N
object features; if feature i is not present, then X' = 0. These intermediate variables can be
considered as feature maps which depend on the object and its location. We model the joint
probability of the object identity 0, its location L, the feature maps {Xi, i = 1, 2, ... , N}
and the image I. Eq. 2.3 takes the form
P(0, L,X
1,... ,XNI)
= P(O)P(L)P(X1,... , XN 1LO)P(11X1,.. -
XN) 
(2.4)
We then take the variables to be discrete, because of computational considerations and
because images (and arrays of neurons) can be represented on discrete grids. Because
of the assumed conditional independence P(X 1,--- 
, XN IL, 0) is given by the following
factorization:
i=N
P(Xl,... ,XNIL,O) 
JP(XIL,O)} 
(2.5)
i=l1
Applying Eq. 2.5, Eq. 2.4 leads to our final probabilistic model

The model consists of a location encoding variable L, object encoding variable 0, and
feature-map variables {X', i = 1, ... , N}, that encode position-feature combinations. The
object variable 0 is modeled as a multinomial random variable with 10 values correspond-
ing to objects known by the model. The location variable L is modeled as a multinomial
random variable with I LI distinct values that enumerate all possible location and scale com-
binations. The variable X' is a multinomial variable with ILl + 1 values (0, 1, --- , L).
As we discuss later (Sec. 2.3), it is easier to map the model onto the functional corti-
cal anatomy (see Fig. 2-4) of attention by introducing the (dummy) variables (F')i=1...N,
which are not strictly needed but can be interpreted directly in a biological perspective.
Each feature-encoding unit F is modeled as a binary random variable that represents the
presence or absence of a feature irrespective of location and scale. The location (Xi) of
feature i depends on the feature variable P and on the location variable L. This relation,
and the defintion of F, can be written as P(Xi IL, 0) = P(XilF, L)P(Fi 10). With the
auxiliary variables (F)i=1...N the factorization of Eq. 2.6 can be rewritten as

P(0, L,X 1,... ,XN,F,... ,FNI)
=P(O)P(L) {J{P(X'lL, F')P(FIO)} P(IX,... , XN) 
(27)
(i=N
The model assumes the following generative process
1. Choose 0 ~ multinomial(P(O))
2. Choose L ~ multinomial(P(L))
3. For each of the N features
* Choose P ~ Bernoulli(P(Fi|O))
" Choose X' - multinomial (P(X'l L, F)) (see text for details).
The conditional probability P(XIF', L) is such that when feature F is present (P = 1),
and L = 1*, the feature-map is activated at either X' = 1* or a nearby location with high
probability (decreasing in a gaussian manner). However, when the feature P is absent
(P = 0), only the 'null' state of X', (X' = 0) is active. Thus, when location L = l* is
active, the object features are either near location * or absent from the image. In addition
to this top-down generative constraint, bottom-up evidence P(1IX 1 -.. XN) is Computed
from the input image 2.The conditional probabilities are specified in Table Al. Visual per-
ception here corresponds to estimating posterior probabilities of visual features (Fi=1 ...N,
object 0 and location L following the presentation of a new stimulus. In particular, P(L I)
can be interpreted as a saliency map (Koch and Ullman, 1985), that gives the saliency of
each location in a feature-independent manner. P(FlI) and P(O I) can be thought of as
location independent readout of object features and object identity respectively.
Remarks: The probabilistic model of Eq. 2.7 encodes several constraints resulting from
our three assumptions:
2P(I|X I ... XN) obtained from the image is not a normalized probability. In practice, it is proportional
to the output of a feature detector. However, this does not adversely affect the inference process.

" Eachfeature P occurs at a single location/scale in the feature map. This apparently
strong constraint follows from assumption (a) and (c). Assumption (c) is suggested
directly by the assumption that the features are relatively complex (such as V4-like
features). Our model implements the constraint above through the automatically
enforced mutual exclusion of different states of X'. We emphasize that there is no
mutual exclusion among the different features - multiple features can be active at the
same location. This is in contrast to earlier probabilistic models (Rao, 2005) where
features were mutually exclusive as well.
" Objects can be represented in terms of a single set of universal features (F 1,--- 
, F").
Although some objects may have diagnostic features, a large variety of objects can
be represented using a shared set of primitive shape features (Ranzato et al., 2007;
Mutch and Lowe, 2006; Serre et al., 2007c; Torralba et al., 2004).
These assumptions limit the range and kind of "images" that can be generated by this
model. The relevant question, however, is whether such a simplified model of the visual
world, imposed by the objective constraint of sample complexity, actually describes what
is used by the visual system.
2.1.2 
Comparison to prior work
The model is closely related to the bayesian model of spatial attention proposed by Rao
(2005). The previous model was modified to include the following significant extensions:
(i) The model includes both feature and object priors. This allows us to implement top-
down feature-based attention in addition to spatial attention. (ii) The model allows con-
junction of features that share common spatial modulation, while prior work modeled a
single feature dimension (e.g., orientation) with mutually exclusive features. (iii) Spatial
attention is extended to include scale/size information in addition to just location informa-
tion. Our new model can account not only for visual searches in artificial search arrays
but also for searches in real-world natural images for which it predicts well human eye-
movements under bottom-up and top-down attention (see Section 4).

2.2 
Model properties
2.2.1 
Translation invariance
The P units encode the presence or absence of individual features in a translation/scale
invariant manner. The invariance is achieved by pooling responses from all locations. The
posterior probability of the feature P is given by:
P(FJII) o 
P(F) ( P(X|F,L)P(L)P(I|X) 
(2.8)
L,Xi
Note that the factor P(F) is obtained by marginalizing over all objects (P(F) = Eo P(Fi1O)P(O)).
Spatial invariance is achieved by marginalizing (summing over) the L variables (see Fig.
2-2).
2.2.2 
Spatial attention
As sketched in Fig. 2-5 (panel b), a key limitation of the feedforward (max) pooling mech-
anisms arises when performing recognition in the presence of clutter (see (Serre et al.,
2007b)), because of integration of visual information over relatively large receptive fields
that makes the models prone to interference from distractors in the background. A natu-
ral way to solve this problem is to rely on spatial attentional mechanisms whereby priors
P(L) are concentrated around a region of interest. This may solve the problem of clutter
by suppressing the background responses outside the spotlight (see 2-5, panel c).
In our model, spatial attention follows from setting a prior P(L) concentrated around the
location/scale of interest (see Fig. 2-2b). Consider the posterior estimate of the feature unit
P. Ignoring the feature prior, the estimate is given by:
P(F'|I) oc ( 
P(X|F, L)P(L)P(I|X). 
(2.9)
L,Xi
The corresponding unit response can be considered as a weighted sum of the evidence

P(IXi). Under spatial attention, regions inside the spotlight of attention are weighed
more, while those outside the spotlight are suppressed. As a consequence, the receptive
fields of the non-retinotopic F units at the next stage are effectively shrunk.
2.2.3 
Feature-based attention
As illustrated in Fig. 2-5 (panel d), when a single isolated object/feature is present, it is
possible to read out its location from the posterior probability P(L|I). However when
multiple objects/features are present (see Fig. 2-5, panel e), it is no longer possible to
readout this information. To solve this problem, parallel feature-based attention results
from concentrating the priors P(F) (P(Fl10) for an object search) around the features of
interest (e.g., red and square features when searching for a red square). The value of the
saliency map is given by:
P(L|I) oc P(L) 7 ( P(X|F, L)P(F)P(I|X) 
(2.10)
i 
Fi,Xi
Increasing the concentration of the prior around the target feature F enhances the preferred
feature at all locations while low priors on other features suppress activity from distracting
objects. After this, the location of the preferred feature can be read out from the posterior
probability P(L|I), which can be interpreted as a saliency map.
2.2.4 
Feature pop-out
Since the X' units are mutually exclusive (Vi, Zxt P(Xl Fi, L) = 1), increasing the activ-
ity (probability) at one location in an image typically reduces the likelihood of the stimulus
being present at other locations (see Fig. 2-2d). In a sense, this is similar to the extra-
classical receptive field effects observed throughout the visual cortex (see (Carandini et al.,
1997) for instance). As a result, a unique feature that is active at only one location tends
to induce a higher likelihood, concentrated at that location, than a common feature, present
at multiple locations, for each of the corresponding locations . This predicts a 'pop-out'
effect, whereby a salient items immediately draw attention (the model shows a strong bias

Figure 2-3: Left: Efficient vs. inefficient searches: When a stimulus differs from the background
in a single dimension (first and second column) search is easy (indicated by a high contrast saliency
map) and independent of the number of distractors. However, when features are shared between the

map). Right: Object recognition in clutter consists of feature-based attention followed by spatial
attention. The most likely location of the target is found by feature-based attention by setting ap-
propriately the feature priors (middle column). The hypothesis is then verified by deploying spatial
attention around the location of the highest saliency (the spatial priors are changed in the right col-
umn). The value of the feature units P(FII) indicate the presence or absence of an object feature.
of the saliency map towards the location of the salient or 'surprising' item (see Fig. 2-2d).
In contrast to our model, traditional approach to pop-out has been based on image saliency.
In (Itti et al., 1998), center-surround difference across color, intensity and orientation di-
mensions is used as measure of saliency. In (Gao and Vasconcelos, 2007), self infor-
mation of the stimuli (- log(P(I))) is used as measure of distinctiveness (Zhang et al.,
2008). In (Rosenholtz, 1985), the normalized deviation from mean response is used in-
stead.These models, however, cannot account for the task-dependency of eye movements
(Yarbus, 1967).

tures showing that they are sufficient to reproduce attentional effects such as pop-out and
search asymmetries. In addition, this model can reproduce effects such as contour com-
pletion and cross-orientation inhibition that is currently not possible with the proposed
model. However, recent evidence seems to show Vi to be relatively unaffected by top-
down attentional modulation (Hegde and Felleman, 2003), thus moving the locus of at-
tention away from VI and towards higher regions such as V4. Experiments on spatial
attention (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999) and feature-based attention (Bichot et al., 2005)
have shown attentional modulation in V4.
2.2.5 
Efficient vs. inefficient search tasks
The maximum value of the saliency map (or the posterior probability of location P(L II))
can be viewed as a proxy for the efficiency of search. From this point of view, the bayesian
model can predict the relative difficulty of a search task, at least in artificial arrays (see Fig.
2-3a).
2.3 
Neural interpretation
Prior work has shown that perception under uncertainty can be modeled well using Bayesian
inference (Knill and Richards, 1996; Rao et al., 2002a; Kersten et al., 2004). However, how
the brain represents and combines probabilities at the level of neurons is unclear. Computa-
tional models have attempted to model probabilities using populations codes (Pouget et al.,
2000), spiking models of neurons (Deneve, 2008; Pouget et al., 2000), recurrent networks
(Rao, 2004) etc. The properties of the model of attention described so far do not depend on
how probabilities are mapped to neural activities. In the following neural interpretation of
the model we assume, however, that probabilities are represented as firing rates of popula-
tions of neurons (the physiology experiments typically measure firing rates averaged across
"identical" neurons over a series of recordings).

cortical feedback from areas of the parietal cortex onto areas of the ventral stream (providing spatial
attention) and, (iii) feedforward connections to the parietal cortex that serves as a 'saliency map'
encoding the visual relevance of image locations (Koch and Ullman, 1985).
2.3.1 
Tentative mapping to brain areas
The graphical model can be tentatively mapped - in a way which is likely to be an oversim-
plification - into the basic functional anatomy of attention, involving areas of the ventral
stream such as V4 and areas of the dorsal stream such as LIP (and/or FEF), known to show
attentional effects (see Table 2.1, Fig. 2-4). Thus, following the organization of the visual
system (Ungerleider and Haxby, 1994), the proposed model consists of two separate visual
processing streams: a 'where' stream, responsible for encoding spatial coordinates and a
'what' stream for encoding the identity of object categories. Our model describes a pos-
sible interaction between intermediate areas of the ventral ('what') stream such as V4/PIT
(modeled as X' variables) where neurons are tuned to shape-like features of moderate com-
plexity (Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Tanaka, 1996; Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996) and

higher visual areas such as AIT where retinotopy is almost completely lost (Oram and Per-
rett, 1992; Logothetis et al., 1995) (modeled as F' units). Prior (non-bayesian) attempts to
model this interaction can be found in (Grossberg, 1999; Van Der Velde and De Kamps,
2001).
In our interpretation, the L variable, which encodes position and scale independently of
features, may correspond to the LIP area in the parietal cortex. In the model, the L variable
is represented as a multinomial variable. Each X' variable corresponds to a collection of V4
neurons, where each neuron can be interpreted as encoding one of the mutually exclusive
state of Xi. The posterior probability P(X' = x|I) is then interpreted as the response
of a V4 neuron encoding feature i and at location x. Thus, in the neural interpretation,
P(X 
= 11)(X = 211) ... P(X = ILI) can be mapped to the firing rates of the
neuron encoding feature Fi at location 1, 2..1 L I respectively.
The F units correspond to non-retinotopic, spatial and scale invariant cells found in higher
layers of the ventral stream such as AIT and IT. In feedforward models (Riesenhuber and
Poggio, 1999b; Serre et al., 2005b), such invariance (over a limited range) is obtained
via a max pooling operation. The original motivation for a max operation was that the
max is a natural selection operation: when a feature is active at multiple locations within
the receptive field of a unit, the max operation selects the strongest active location while
ignoring other locations. Within the bayesian framework, the individual locations within a
feature map are mutually exclusive and thus a strong activation at one location suppresses
the likelihood of activation at other locations. Interestingly, the bayesian model of attention
is also performing a selection akin to the max operation - by using the 'sum-product'
algorithm for belief propagation.

Model 
Representation
(Brain) 
(Biological evidence)
L (LIP/FEF) 
This variable encodes the location and scale of a target object. It is modeled as a
discrete multinomial variable with ILl distinct values.
Prior studies (Colby and Goldberg, 1999) have shown that the parietal cortex main-
tains several spatial maps of the visual environment (eye-centered, head-centered etc.)
Studies also show that response of LIP neurons is correlated with the likelihood ratio
of a target object (Bisley and Goldberg, 2003). In this paper, we hypothesize that the
saliency map (corresponding to the variable L) is represented in the parietal cortex.
O (PFC) 
This variable encodes the identity of the object. It is modeled as a discrete multinomial
variable that can take 101 distinct values.
The preferred stimulus of neurons tend to increase in complexity along the ventral
stream: from simple oriented bars in area V 1 (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959) to combina-
tions of orientations and features of moderate complexity in intermediate visual areas
V2 (Hegde and Van Essen, 2000; Ito and Komatsu, 2004) and V4 (Pasupathy and Con-
nor, 2001; Desimone and Schein, 1987; Gallant et al., 1996), to parts and objects in
area IT (Tanaka, 1996; Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996). It has been shown that object
category information is represented in higher areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
(Freedman et al., 2001).
Fi (IT) 
Each feature variable F* encodes the presence of a specific shape feature. Each such
unit is modeled as a discrete binary variable that can be either on or off. The pres-
ence/absence of a given feature is computed in a position/scale invariant manner (see
(Serre et al., 2005b) for details). In practice, for the visual tasks described in this paper,
we have used a dictionary of features of about 10 ~ 100 such features.
Neurons in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex are typically tuned to objects and parts
(Tanaka, 1996) and exhibit some tolerance with respect to the exact position and scale
of stimulus over within their receptive fields (typically on the order of a few degrees
for position and on the order of one octave for size (Logothetis et al., 1995).
Xi (V4) 
This variable can be thought of as a feature map that encodes the joint occurrence of
the feature (F*) at location L = 1. It is modeled as a discrete multinomial variable
with JL|+1 distinct values (0, 1 ... L). Values (1 ... L) correspond to valid locations
while X4 = 0 indicates that the feature is completely absent from the input.
Feature-based attention is found to modulate the response of V4 neurons at all loca-
tions (Bichot et aL, 2005). Under spatial attention, V4 neurons that have receptive
fields overlapping with the locus of attention are enhanced (McAdams and Maunsell,
1999). Thus V4 neurons are involved in feature-based attention as well as spatial atten-
tion marking V4 as the likely area of interaction between ventral and parietal cortices.
I (V2) 
This is the feed-forward evidence obtained from the lower areas of ventral stream
model. Given the image I, for each orientation and location, P(IlXi) is set propor-
tional to the output of the filter.
The neurons in area V2 are found to be sensitive to conjunction of orientations, curva-
ture and grating-like stimulus (Hegde and Van Essen, 2000; Ito and Komatsu, 2004).
We use the computational model of the ventral stream (Serre et al., 2007c) to derive
V2-like features from the image.
Table 2.1: Bayesian model units and tentative mapping to brain areas.

Conditional Probability 
Modeling
P(L) 
Each scene, with its associated view-point, places constraints
on the location and sizes of objects in the image. Such con-
straints can be specified explicitly (e.g., during spatial atten-
tion) or learned using a set of training examples (Torralba,
2003b).
P(FilO) 
The probability of each feature being present or absent given
the object; it is learned from the training data.
P(X'JF', L) 
When the feature Fi is present and location L = 1* is
active, the Xi units that are nearby unit L = 1* are most
likely to be activated. 
When the feature F' is absent,
only the X' = 0 location in the feature map is activated.
This conditional probability is given by the following table
Ft = 1,L = l 
F* = OL = l
X' = 0 
P(XI|F', L) = 61 
P(Xi|Fi, L) = 1 -

61 and 62 are small values (~ 0.01), chosen to ensure that
E P(XiIF', L) = 1.
P(IlXi) 
For each location within the feature map, P(IlX') provides
the likelihood that X' is active. In the model, this likelihood
is set to be proportional to the activations of the shape-based
units (see (Serre et al., 2007c)).

2.3.2 
Inference using belief propagation
Within the bayesian network, inference can be performed using any of several inference al-
gorithms such as junction tree, variable elimination, MCMC (Markov-chain Monte carlo)
and belief propagation (Wainwright and Jordan, 2008; Gilks and Spiegelhalter, 1996).
Sampling-based approaches such as MCMC and belief propagation lend themselves more
easily to biological interpretations. In the simulations of this paper, the inference mecha-
nism used is the 'belief propagation' algorithm (Pearl, 1988), which aims at propagating
new evidence and/or priors from one node of the graphical model to all other nodes. We
can regard some of the messages passed between the variables during belief propagation as
interactions between the ventral and dorsal streams. Spatial attention and feature attention
can then be interpreted within this message passing framework. A formal mathematical
treatment of the messages passed between nodes is sketched below. For simplicity we con-
sider the case of a model based on a single feature F and adopt the notation used in (Rao,
2005), where the top-down messages, r() and bottom-up messages A() are replaced by a
uniform mo term.

The first three messages correspond to the priors imposed by the task. The rest correspond
to bottom-up evidence propagated upwards within the model. The posterior probability of
location (saliency map) is given by
P(LII) oC 
(mL--Xi)(mXi-,L 
'217)

The constant of proportionality can be resolved after computing marginals over all values
of the random variable. Thus, the saliency map is influenced by task dependent prior on
location P(L), prior on features P(Fl10) as well as the evidence from the ventral stream
mXiL-L. Note that the summations in the message passing equations are performed over all
the discrete states of the variable. Thus, L is summed over its states, {1, 2 -.- 
ILI}, F' is
summed over {0, 1} and Xi, over states {0, 1, ---IL|}. Notice that the belief propagation
inference converges (to the posterior) after one bottom-up and one top-down cycle.
Multiple features 
When considering multiple features, the bayesian inference proceeds
as in a general polytree (Pearl, 1988). Most messages remain identical. However, the
message mLXi is influenced by the presence of other features and is now given by:
mL-Xi 
P(L) H mX-L 
(2.18)
(2.19)
Remarks:
The mapping between the multinomial nodes/units in the model and neurons in the
cortex is neither obvious nor unique. Consider a multinomial variable Y that takes
states Y1, Y2.. ys. A possible mapping is to S individual binary indicator variables
I, 
2 ... Is, with the constraint that (I1 + 12 ... Is) = 1. Then we would map each
variable Ii to an individual neuron whose firing rate is proportional to the its posterior
probability of being on. The constraint that only a single neuron is active may be
implemented through lateral inhibition in terms of a form of divisive normalization.
In this interpretation, a multinomial random variable Y corresponds to a collection
of S laterally inhibited neurons such that the firing rate of neuron i represents a value
proportional to its posterior probability. For binary random variables, the mapping is
more direct. Each binary variable can be interpreted as a single neuron with its firing
rate proportional to the posterior probability of the variable being on.

"Predicting" physiological effects

3.1 
"Predicting" the physiological effects of attention
Here we show that the proposed model is consistent with neurophysiology experiments
about the effects of feature-based and spatial attention (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999;
Bichot et al., 2005; Reynolds and Heeger, 2009). We also find that, surprisingly, several
key attentional phenomena such such as pop-out, multiplicative modulation and change in
contrast response emerge directly, without any further assumptions or parameter tuning, as
properties of the bayesian model.
3.1.1 
Attentional effects in V4
Within our model, V4 neurons are represented with variables {XI, X2 ... XN}. For anal-
ysis, we assume a single feature for simplicity. Now, consider the response of the model
unit X' given a stimulus I, which is given by
P(I|Xi ) EFi,L P(Xi|IFi,7 L) P(L)P( F')
P(XZlI) 
= 
(3.1)
PX) {P(IXi) EFi,L P(Xi|Fi, L)P(L)P(Fi)
Here, the term P(IXi) represents the excitatory component-the bottom-up evidence from
the input I. For example, assume that when features F' correspond to different orientations,
given the image I, for each orientation and location, P(IlXi) is set proportional to the
output of an oriented Gabor filter. P(L) and P(F') serve as the attentional modulation.
We make the assumption that features and location priors can be set independently based
on the search task. The conditional probabilities P(XlFi, L) may then be interpreted as
synaptic strengths, indicating how strongly locations on the feature map are affected by
attentional modulation. The sum over all Xi (used to generate normalized probabilities) in
the denominator can be regarded as a divisive normalization factor.
Thus, Eq. 3.1 may be re-written in terms of three components: (i) an excitatory component
E(X') = P(I|Xi) (image I is observed and fixed); (ii) an attentional modulation com-
ponent A(L, F') = P(L)P(F'); (iii) a divisive normalization factor S(L, F'). With this

notation, Eq. 3.1 can be rewritten as:
P(Xill 
-E(X')A(F',L)(32
S(Fi,L)
Equation 3.2 turns out to be closely related to a phenomenological model of attention re-
cently proposed by Reynolds and Heeger (2009). In this model, the response of a neuron
at location x and tuned to orientation 0 is given by:
R(x,60) 
-
A(x, 0)E(x, 6) 
(33)
S(x, 6) + a
Here, E(x, 0) represents the excitatory component of the neuron response. S(x, 6) repre-
sents the suppressive component of the neuron response derived by pooling activity over
a larger area. A(x, 6) represents the attentional modulation that enhances specific orienta-
tions and locations, based on the search task. Reynolds & Heeger showed that the model of
Eq.3.3 can reproduce key physiological effects of attention such as contrast gain behavior
under different stimulus conditions. A comparison of Eq. 3.2 with Eq. 3.3 suggests that the
normalization model of Reynolds & Heeger model is a special case of our model e.g. Eq.
3.2. Normalization in our model emerges directly from the bayesian formulation, instead
of being an ad hoc assumption'.
3.1.2 
Multiplicative modulation
Spatial attention 
In (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999), it was observed that the tuning
curve of a V4 neuron is enhanced (multiplicatively) when attention is directed to its recep-
tive field. We observe that this effect occurs in the model. Recall that the response of a
simulated neuron encoding feature i and at location x, is given by
P(Xi = x|I) 
cK E P(Xi = x|F, L)P(I|Xz)P(F')P(L). 
(3.4)
Fi,L
'It is to be noted that the normalization model (as described in (Reynolds and Heeger, 2009)) explains the
individual phenomenon of change in contrast response due to attention. The bayesian model described here
can explain and predict several additional phenomena discussed in this section that are not addressed by the
normalization model.

Figure 3-1: Effect of spatial attention on tuning response. The tuning curve shows a multiplicative
modulation under attention. The inset shows the replotted data from (McAdams and Maunsell,
1999).
Under normal conditions, P(L) and P(F) can be assumed to have a uniform distribu-
tion and thus the response of the neuron is largely determined by the underlying stimulus
(P(I|X')). Under spatial attention, the location priors are concentrated around L = x.
This leads to a multiplicative change (from P(L = x) = 1/IL to P(L = x) ~ 1) that
enhance the response, even under the same stimulus condition (see Fig. 3-3).
Reinterpreting in terms of the message passing algorithm, spatial attention corresponds to
concentrating the prior P(L) around the location/scale of interest (see Fig. 2-2b). Such a
change in the prior is propagated from L to X' (through messages in the bayesian network).
This results in a selective enhancement of all feature maps X' for i = 1.. .n at locations
11 ... im that overlap with the attentional spotlight P(L) and in suppression everywhere
else. The message passing is initiated at the level of the L units assumed to be in parietal
cortex) and should manifest itself after a short delay in the P units (in the ventral stream),
in agreement with physiological data (Buschman and Miller, 2007).

tiplicative modulation of neuronal response under attention. Units in the PFC and higher

areas seem to modulate arrays of "feature detectors" cells in intermediate areas of the ven-
tral stream (PIT and V4) according to how diagnostic they are for the specific categorization
task at hand. The data suggest that this modulation is effective at all locations within the
receptive field. An equivalent effect is also observed in the model. Under normal condi-
tions, P(L) and P(F) have a uniform distribution and thus the response of the neuron is
largely determined by the underlying stimulus (P(IX')). Under feature-based attention,
the feature priors are modified to P(F = 1) ~ 1. This leads to a multiplicative change
(from P(F' = 1) = 1/2 to P(Fi = 1) 
1) enhancing the response at all locations. The
response is more pronounced when the stimulus is preferred (P(IXi) is high).
In terms of message passing, objects priors are first concentrated around the object(s) of
interest (e.g., (see Fig. 2-2c). 'pedestrian' when asked to search for pedestrians in street
scenes). The change in object prior is propagated to the feature units, through the mes-
sage 0 -+ Fi. This results in a selective enhancement of the features that are typically
associated with the target object (e.g., vertical features when searching for pedestrians) and
suppression of others. This preference propagates to all feature-map locations through the
message mFL4xi = >o P(F'|O)P(O).
The L unit pools across all features X3 for j =1...n at a specific location 1. However,
because of the feature-based modulation, only the locations that contain features associated
with the object are selectively enhanced. Thus, priors on objects in the ventral stream
activates units in the parietal cortex at locations that are most likely to contain the object of
interest. The message passing is thus initiated in the ventral stream first and is manifested
in the parietal cortex (L units) later, in agreement with the recent data by Buschman &
Miller (Buschman and Miller, 2007)( see Fig.2-2).

3.1.3 
Contrast response
The influence of spatial attention on contrast response of V4 neurons have been studied
extensively. Prior work showed two major, apparently contradictory, effects: in (Martinez-
Trujillo and Treue, 2002; Reynolds et al., 2000) attention was shown to shift the contrast
response of neurons, while in (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999; Treue and Trujillo, 1999a)
attention was shown to induce a multiplicative gain in the contrast response of neurons.
Reynolds and Heeger (2009) reconciled these differences by observing that these two ex-
periments were performed under different stimulus conditions. In the experiments in which
a contrast gain was observed, the spotlight of attention was larger than the stimulus. In the
experiments in which a response gain was seen, the stimulus was observed to be larger
than the spotlight of attention. Reynolds & Heeger showed that their normalization model
of attention(see Sec.2.3) produces the observed effects under these different conditions.
In Fig.3-3c and Fig.3-3d we show that our bayesian model, as expected given its close
relation with Reynolds & Heeger's model, is also consistent with the observed dependency
of contrast on attention. In this simulation, the response without attention is assumed to
depend on contrast (the bottom-up evidence P(1X 1 ... X") is directly derived from the
outputs of oriented Gabor filters operating on images of varying contrast). The bayesian
model "predicts" how the contrast response changes with attention.

3.2 
Attentional effects in MT
3.2.1 
Multiplicative modulation
So far we have restricted our analysis and to interaction of the ventral stream and parietal
regions (and consequently to static images alone). However, motion serves as a powerful
cue for visual attention. In the brain, the dorsal stream comprising of regions V1, MT, MST,
STS (Ungerleider and Pasternak, 2004) processes motion information. Similar to properties
of the hierarchical ventral stream, the specificity of stimulus is found to increase as we
progress higher in the hierarchy. Physiological studies have shown attention can modulate
neurons in region MT in the dorsal stream, similar to the modulation found in V4 region
in the ventral stream (Treue and Trujillo, 1999b; Beauchamp et al., 1997; Womelsdorf
et al., 2006). We propose to incorporate motion based features in addition to existing
shape and color features within the attentional framework. Retaining its parallel to biology,
we proposed to use motion features derived from the computational model of the dorsal
stream (Jhuang et al., 2007) and specifically that of region MT (Simoncelli and Heeger,
1998; Rust et al., 2006). The extended model comprising shape and motion features will
be demonstrated using real world video sequences.
Preliminary results: The Bayesian model of attention is agnostic to the origin of the
features and only requires a spatially organized feature map for its functioning. We use
the computational model of the area MT proposed by Simoncelli (Simoncelli and Heeger,
1998; Rust et al., 2006) to compute the motion features. Thus, in addition to the shape-
based features we introduce motion based feature maps (corresponding to four orientations
and two speeds). The message passing equations remain unaltered. In the following, we
shall present preliminary results illustrating spatial and feature-based attention operating
on moving stimuli.
The stimulus consists of three horizontal sections of moving dot patterns (see Fig.3-4).
Each section can have a separate direction and speed of motion in addition to its color.
The arrows indicate the direction of motion of the dot pattern and is not a part of the
stimulus. P(L) and P(F) correspond to the spatial and feature prior respectively. These

indicate the location and features of interest before the stimulus is presented. P(L II) and
P(FI I) are the posterior probabilities obtained after the sitmulus is observed. Thus, these
values account for the bottom-up evidence from the stimulus as well as top-down task-
based priors.
Pop-out: The region of the stimulus where the direction differs from rest of the stimuls
has the highest saliency. This may be attributed to lateral inhibition within each feature
dimension (implied by the mutual exclusion of the different states of variable X'). The
absolute direction of motion does not affect the result. In the example (see Fig.3-4a), the
central band region has the highest saliency because its direction differs from rest of the
stimulus.
Spatial attention: A specific region within the stimulus can be attended while ignoring the
rest by altering the spatial prior P(L). In the example, the 'read-out' from the feature units
indicate the speed and direction of the dots in the attended region. We observed that the
feature in the attended region is enhanced while the others are supressed (see Fig.3-4b).
Feature-based attention: Instead of attending to a location, attention can be directed to a
specific feature. The 'read-out' from the location unit indicates the area where the attended
feature is likely to be found. In the example, the feature to be attended is specified by
altering P(F). The most likely location can then be 'read-out' from P(L I) (see Fig.3-4c).
Multi-modal interaction: In this example, we illustrate the interaction of color and motion
features, a question explored ealier in (Wannig et al., 2007). We use a simpler stimulus,
where dots moving in different directions are non-overlapping. Furthermore, the color of
the dots can vary independently of its direction. In the example (see Fig. 3-4d), attending
to a specific color results in the 'read out' of its corresponding direction of motion. Alter-
natively, attending to a specific direction allows us to 'read out' its color. This effect may
be explained as a two stage process in which, attending to a specific motion or color feature
biases attention towards the locations where this feature is present. This in turn, enhances
other features also present within the attended region (see Fig.3-4d).

"Predicting" effects of spatial attention in IT
3.3.1 
Experimental evidence
In their seminal study, Moran and Desimone (1985) showed that the response of neurons in
the extrastriate cortex is modulated by spatial attention while neurons in the striate cortex
are not. Specifically, when multiple objects were presented within the receptive field of a
V4/IT neuron, it was found that the response of the neuron depended only on the proper-
ties of the attended stimulus. The response of the neuron to the unattended stimulus was
reduced even when it was the preferred stimulus of the neuron. The study measured the
effects of attention at the level of individual neurons. However, physiological studies have
shown that objects are encoded using a population of neurons in IT (Kobatake and Tanaka,
1994; Tanaka, 1996). Thus, in order to study the effect of attention on object perception, it
is essential to study the phenomena at the population level. A recent (and ongoing) study
in Poggio and Desimone labs attempts to quantify the effect of attention on IT neurons at
a population level. Specifically, the study attempts to measure how the information 2 about
objects in the receptive field is affected by spatial attention. In the following, we briefly
describe the original experiment followed by simulations using the model.
Data 
The stimuli used in the experiment consists of images composed using one (isolated
condition) or three (cluttered condition) out of a pool of 16 objects. The individual objects
used are shown in Fig. A3. Each object was placed at one of three possible positions
on the contralateral hemi field. Overall the experiment used 912 images consisting of 48
images containing isolated objects (16 objects presented at one of the three positions) and
768 images containing three objects (see Fig 3-5)3.
Experiment The stimuli was presented to two alert monkeys. The monkey fixated on a
spot at the center of the stimulus. The stimulus consisted of one or three objects. In case
of a stimulus with a single object, it was always considered as the target object. When the

stimulus consisted of three objects, one of the objects was designated as the target and the
other two objects were considered as distracters. Between 518-528 ms after the objects
appeared, a cue was presented in the form of a short line (see Fig. 3-6). The monkey
was rewarded for saccading to the cued object when it changed in color, which happened
between 518-2160ms after the objects appeared on screen. A total of 98 and 139 cells were
recorded from the first and second monkey respectively.
Population decoding 
Using the neural responses obtained during isolated object presen-
tation, a statistical classifier is trained to associate the neural responses to the identity of
the object. A classifier is trained for each of the 16 objects (one vs. all paradigm). The pre-
diction score obtained from the classifier represents the extent of information present about
the target object. The decoding performance is measured in terms of the area under ROC
curve. This kind of neural decoding paradigm has been used in interpretation of neural data
before (Hung et al., 2005).
Results 
The study showed that when multiple objects are present within the receptive
field of an IT neuron, the response consists of a mixture of information about objects
present in the stimuli. However, once an attentional cue is provided, information about
the cued object is enhanced relative to the other objects in the display (see Fig. 3-7 a).
This effect could be explained as (i) attention restoring activities of neurons similar to that
of an isolated object or (ii) attention changing the representation of object by inclusion of
additional information. The study showed that the former hypothesis is better supported by
the evidence. In the presence of attention, the pattern of neural activities reverts to activ-
ity similar to the condition when the cued object was present in isolation. The study also
showed that bottom-up cues such as change of color can temporarily override top-down
effects of spatial attention.

the same set of 912 stimuli to the model. The prior on object identity was set to be uniform.
In the case where no spatial cue was provided in the original experiment, the spatial prior
was set to be uniform. If a cue was provided, spatial prior is set to be a gaussian around the
object location. The size of the gaussian is chosen to be such that the probability mass is
concentrated within the spatial support of the cued object. The posterior probability of the
object provides a quantity that is similar to prediction score given by the classifier in the
original experiment. The prediction is assumed to be correct if the object with the highest
probability was the designated target. The performance of the model is measured in terms
of the area under ROC.
Results 
The results (see Fig. 3-7 b) show that similar to the original experiment, the
decoding performance is the highest in the isolated condition and decreases under clutter
when no attentional cue is provided. However, under spatial attention, the performance
is restored and is similar to the condition when only isolated objects are presented. The
absolute decoding performance of the model is much higher than obtained from neural
data. During the simulation, the features are assumed to be noise free. Furthermore, the
size of the spotlight of attention is fixed.

Parameter fitting We studied the effects of these parameters on the decoding perfor-
mance (see Fig 3-8). We observed that increasing the noise (probability of error) decreases
the absolute decoding performance in both the isolated and attended condition. On the
other hand, increasing the size of the attentional spotlight decreases the performance for
the attended condition while not affecting the decoding performance for the isolated con-
dition. When the size of the attentional spotlight is enlarged, features from the other object
interfere causing a drop in performance. With a proper choice of the noise level and the
size of the attentional spotlight, the performance of the model can be made to be close to
the performance obtained from IT neurons. This can be considered a crude form of fitting
model parameters (See Sec. A1.4 for implementation details).

Discussion
The effect of attention on IT can be summarized eliminating interference of clutter and
restoring information of the target object. This is similar to the attentional spotlight metaphor
(Crick and Koch, 1990b,a), where attention "illuminates" area/features of interest while
suppressing the distracters. The prediction of the model is consistent with this explana-
tion. In this study, we fit the model parameters such that the decoding performance was
similar to that of IT neurons. Conversely, it can be speculated that the model parameters is
predictive of the level of noise and the size of the attentional spotlight in the brain.

Chapter 4
Predicting eye-movements

4.1 
Predicting human eye movements
Human and animal studies (see (Wolfe, 2007) for a recent review) have isolated at least
three main components used to guide the deployment of an eye movements. First, studies
have shown that image-based bottom-up cues can capture attention, particularly during
free viewing conditions1 . Second, task dependence also plays a significant role in visual
search (Wolfe, 2007; Yarbus, 1967)2. Third, structural associations between objects and
their locations within a scene (contextual cues have been shown to play a significant role in
visual search and object recognition (Torralba, 2003b).
How the visual system combines these cues and what the underlying neural circuits are,
remain largely unknown. Here we show that our model, which combines bottom-up as
well as top-down cues within a probabilistic bayesian framework, can predict well human
eye movements in complex visual search tasks as well as in free viewing conditions.
4.1.1 
Free-viewing
Here we evaluate the performance of the model in a task-free scenario where attention
is purely bottom-up and driven by image salience. We used images and eye-movement
data provided by Bruce and Tsotsos (Bruce and Tsotsos, 2006). The dataset consists of
120 images containing indoor and outdoor scenes with at least one salient object in each
image. The images were presented to 20 human subjects in random order and all the
eye movements made within the first four seconds of presentation were recorded using an
infrared eye tracker. In their work, Bruce and Tsostos used low level filters derived by
performing ICA (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) on color image patches to generate feature
maps. The visual salience of each position is derived from self information. In contrast to
low level filters, our approach uses higher level shape-tuned features and color information
(see Sec. Al).
'A measure that has been shown to be particularly relevant is the local image salience (i.e., the local
feature contrast), which corresponds to the degree of conspicuity between that location and its surround (Itti
and Koch, 2001a).
2Evidence for top-downfeature-based attention comes from both imaging studies in humans (Kanwisher
and Wojciulik, 2000) as well as monkey electrophysiology studies (Maunsell and Treue, 2006).

There are at least two measures that have been used to compare models of attention to
human fixations: normalized scan path saliency (NSS) from (Peters and Itti, 2007) and
fixations in the most salient region (FMSR) from (Bruce and Tsotsos, 2006; Torralba
et al., 2006). For brevity, we only report results using the FMSR measure, but qualita-
tively similar results were obtained for NSS. For each stimulus and task, we calculated
an FMSR value by first thresholding the computed saliency map, retaining only the most
salient pixels (see Fig. 4-1). The FMSR index corresponds to the percentage of human
fixations that fall within this most salient region. A higher value indicates better agreement
with human fixations. We generated an ROC curve by continuously varying the threshold.
The area under the ROC curve provides a summary measure of the agreement with human
observers. We compare our bayesian approach with two baseline algorithms (see Table
4.1).' The results show that the bayesian attention model using shape-based features can
predict human eye movements better than approaches based on low level features.

4.1.2 
Search for cars and pedestrians
We manually selected 100 images (containing cars and pedestrians) from the CBCL Street-
scene database (Bileschi, 2006), while an additional 20 images that did not contain cars
or pedestrians were selected from LabelMe (Russell et al., 2008). These 120 images were
excluded from the training set of the model. On average, images contained 4.6 cars and 2.1
pedestrians. The images (640 x 480 pixels) were presented at a distance of about 70 cm,
roughly corresponding to 16' x 12' of visual angle.
We recruited 8 human subjects (age 18 - 35) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Subjects were paid and gave informed consent. Using a block design (120 trials per block),
3Since the fixation data were pooled from all subjects, it is not possible to compare inter-subject consis-
tency or provide error intervals for this data.

participants were asked to either count the number of cars or the number of pedestrians.
Task and presentation order were randomized for each subject. Every image was presented
twice: once for pedestrians and once for cars. No instructions regarding eye movements
were given, except to maintain fixation on a central cross in order to start each trial. Each
image was then presented for a maximum of 5 seconds, and within this time observers had
to count the number of targets (cars or pedestrians) and press a key to indicate completion.
Subjects then verbally reported the number of targets present, and this was recorded by
the experimenter. We verified that reported counts agreed well with the actual number of
targets. We used an ETL 400 ISCAN table-mounted, video-based eye tracking system to
record eye position during the course of the experiment. Eye position was sampled at a rate
of 240 Hz with an accuracy of about 0.50 of visual angle.
Training the model to attend to specific objects or object classes corresponds to estimating
the probability distribution P(Fi 10)). In practice, this is done by computing feature maps
for a set of training images. The corresponding feature maps are discretized to maximize
classification accuracy following (Fleuret, 2004). The feature F is said to be present if its
detected at any location in the feature map. P(Fl10) is determined by simply counting the
frequency of occurrence of each feature. Since scenes of streets obey strong constraints on
where the objects of interest may be found, it is important to use not only feature priors but
also priors over object location. We follow a procedure outlined in (Torralba, 2003a) for
this purpose. Given the image, we compute the 'gist' (or global summary) of the scene in
a deterministic manner. We use a mixture-of-regressors as in Murphy et al. (2003) to learn
the mapping between the context features and location/scale priors for each object. Details
about how the model was trained for the task is provided in Sec. Al.
As assumed in several previous psychophysical studies (Itti and Koch, 2001a; Rao et al.,
2002a; Torralba et al., 2006), we treat eye movements as a proxy for shifts of attention.
To calculate inter-subject consistency, we generated a saliency map by pooling fixations
from all but one subject in a manner similar to (Torralba et al., 2006), and then tested the
left-out subject on this map. Thus, inter-subject consistency measures performance by a
model constructed from human fixations, which is regarded here as an "ideal model".
Fig. 4-1(b) shows the agreement between the model (and how the location and feature

priors influence performance) and human observers for the first fixation. Table A2 and
A3 provide comparisons for additional number of fixations and against other models of
eye movements (Itti and Koch, 2001 a; Torralba et al., 2006). Our results suggest that our
bayesian model of attention accounts relatively well for the very first fixations (especially
for cars, see Fig. 4-1(b)). Beyond the first saccade, the agreement between model and
human fixations decreases while the inter subject agreement increases (see Table A2 and
A3). The higher relative contribution of the context (i.e., learned location priors) to the
overall prediction is not surprising, since street scenes have strong spatial constraints re-
garding the locations of cars and pedestrians. We found that using image based saliency
cues, corresponding to setting all the priors to be uniform (see also the bottom-up saliency
model (Itti and Koch, 2001a) in Table A2 and A3), does worse than chance. Learning either
spatial priors or feature priors improve the agreement between models and humans signif-
icantly. In addition, learning priors for both cues does better than either in isolation. The
model agrees at the 92% level with human eye fixations on both pedestrian and car search
tasks (measured in terms of the overlap between ROC areas for the first three fixations).
Recently, Ehinger et al. (2009) used a combination of feature bias, gist and bottom-up
saliency to achieve similar predictive performance. The inconsistency between human sub-
jects and the model may be due to higher-level abstract information available to humans
but not to the model. Humans routinely utilize higher level visual cues (e.g., location of
ground-plane) as well non-visual information (e.g., pedestrians are found on pavements
and cross walks) while examining a visual scene.
Previous work has shown that attention is useful in priming object detection (Navalpakkam
and Itti, 2006; Torralba, 2003a), pruning interest points (Rutishauser et al., 2004), quantify-
ing visual clutter (Rosenholtz and Mansfield, 2005) and predicting human eye movements
(Oliva et al., 2003). Here we provide a quantitative evaluation of the proposed model of
attention for detecting objects in images as opposed to predicting human eye movement.
Table 4.2 shows the percentage of object locations that are correctly predicted using differ-
ent cues and models. An object was considered to be correctly detected if its center lied
in the thresholded saliency map. An ROC curve can be obtained by varying the threshold
on the saliency measure. The area under the ROC curve provides an effective measure of

from shape-based units (Serre et al., 2005b) performs better than the representation based
on simple oriented features (Torralba et al., 2006). As expected, bottom-up cues derived
using shape-based features performs better than bottom-up saliency obtained using simple
oriented features (Itti and Koch, 2001 a).

Beyond attention: a non bayesian extension
5.1.1 
Recognition in clutter
In previous work, we have shown that feedforward hierarchical models of object recogni-
tion work relatively well for the recognition of objects presented in isolation and/or with
limited (up to 3-5 objects) background clutter (Serre et al., 2005a, 2007c) but that their level
of performance is affected by the presence of clutter (see (Serre et al., 2007a,b)). Other
clutter effects have been well documented in the context of human psychophysics for the
recognition of artificial letter stimuli (Pelli and Tillman, 2008) as well as objects in natural
images (Serre et al., 2007a). The detrimental effect of clutter has also been reported at the
single cell electrophysiology level whereby the selectivity of neurons is reduced when mul-
tiple stimuli fall within their receptive fields (Zoccolan et al., 2007; Reynolds et al., 1999;
Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999a; Missal et al., 1997). A natural solution to this problem is
a spotlight of attention - a mechanism to suppress regions of the image that are unlikely to
contain objects to be recognized (Walther and Koch, 2007). We propose that this mecha-
nism - and the algorithms to support its function, in particular the choice of the regions to
be suppressed - is in fact visual attention.
During a visual search for a specific feature or object, the top-down feature-based atten-
tional mechanisms first bias the saliency map towards locations that share features with the
target. The sequence of messages are identical with feature-based attention (0 --+ F' -+ X' -- L).
The saliency map (P(LII)) then provides the most likely location containing the target.
The region around the location with the maximum saliency (P(L|I)) can be chosen as the
center of the spotlight of attention.
The search now proceeds with the deployment of the spatial attention around the region of
interest. It is to be noted that this step is outside the bayesian framework. Thus searching for
an object involves several iterations of the core bayesian model and thus several inference
cycles.
To locate subsequent objects, the attentional spotlight is shifted (possibly via the PFC
and/or FEF onto LIP) to the next location (Posner and Cohen, 1984). In subsequent ex-
periments we have set the spotlight to correspond to a fixed size grid of X' units (i.e., 3 x 3

spatial arrangements). It is interesting to note that because of the multi-scale representation
of these features in the original model (Serre et al., 2005b) this translates into a spotlight in
retinotopic coordinates with a variable size and capable of attending to objects at multiple
scales.
In the following, we consider two realistic visual tasks involving object recognition in
clutter and provide evidence suggesting that the strategy described above does work for the
recognition of objects in complex cluttered visual scenes.
5.1.2 
Artificial search arrays
We created search arrays of artificial stimuli and evaluated the performance of the model
operating in two distinct modes to detect the presence/absence of an object: (a) a pre-
attentive mode characterized by a single feedforward sweep through the system (corre-
sponding to processing by the original feedforward hierarchical model with no attentional
mechanisms) and (b) an attentive mode whereby cortical loops are active. Examples of
stimulus display used is provided on Fig. 5-1 (see also Fig. Al). Here we used the same
set of stimuli as in (Hung et al., 2005) (see Fig. A2). The dataset consists of 76 images
belonging to 8 image categories (food, faces, monkey faces, hands, vehicles, lines and
toys). Search arrays were generated with 1, 2, 4 and 8 items placed at random locations.
We generated 50 images containing the target and 50 images where the target was absent.
We repeated this process for each target category and cardinality thus generating 800 x 4
images in all.
Because the positions of items in these artificial search arrays are selected at random, the
location priors P(L) were set to be uniform. Fig. 5-1 shows how switching the identity of
the object to be detected influences the computation of the posterior probabilities for the lo-
cation variable P(LII). Details about the learning of object and feature priors is described
in Sec. Al. Fig. 5-1 shows that the detection performance of the model operating in pre-
attentive feedforward mode degrades with increasing number of distractors (performance
reaching chance level around eight objects). This is similar to previously reported results
(Serre et al., 2007b). Conversely, in the attentive mode, the effect of clutter is much less

quired to correctly localize a target image by (a) the top-down feature-based approach, (b)
the same model setting the object and feature priors to be uniform (effectively approximat-
ing simple bottom-up saliency computations) and a classical bottom-up saliency algorithm
by Itti & Koch (Itti and Koch, 2001a). On average, top-down feature based attention can
locate objects of interest much faster than the bottom-up saliency version (2.6 shifts of
attention vs. 3.6 for 8 item search arrays).
5.1.3 
Complex Natural Scenes
In previous work, a feedforward computational model of the ventral stream of the visual
cortex (Serre et al., 2005b) was shown to account for the level of performance of human
observers during a rapid (masked) animal vs. non-animal recognition task (Serre et al.,
S0.9

........................

2007a). This finding suggested that under rapid masked presentation conditions, a hierar-
chical feedforward model may provide a satisfactory description of information processing
in the ventral stream of the visual cortex. Additionally, we had also found that even for
rapid but unmasked presentation, the agreement between the model and human observers
decreased and in particular, human observers started to significantly outperform the model.
Here we show the addition of cortical feedback and attentional mechanisms improves the
recognition capability of the original hierarchical recognition architecture. We emphasize
that the overall model considered here is not bayesian - only the attentional part is.
The dataset consists of 600 images containing one or more animals and 600 distractor
images comprising of natural and artificial objects (see Fig. A5 and ref. (Serre et al., 2007a)
for examples). Image are organized into four categories based on the amount of clutter and
relative size of the animal with respect to background (The categories are "head", "near
body", "medium body" and "far-body"). We trained the model of attention to localize
animals (details are provided in Sec. A1.5). Fig. 5-2 (a) shows how the combination of
top-down spatial priors together with top-down feature-based priors about animals bias the
saliency map (P(L|I)) towards locations which are likely to contain an animal.
A comparison between the performance of human observers vs. the models is shown in
Fig. 5-2 (b). The bayesian model of attention combines top-down feature and spatial priors
with evidence from the image to generate a saliency map which is then used to gener-
ate spotlights of attention around the likely locations of animals. Examples of attentional
spotlights generated by the model are provided in Fig. 5-2(a) (see also Fig. A6).
The detection accuracy of the model increases from 82.5 ± 2.75 under purely feedforward
condition to 86.5 ± 1.6 when attentive processing is added to the feedforward network.
Human performance with the same stimuli increases from 80.12 ± 2.5 when the SOA (cor-
responding to the delay between stimuls onset and the mask) is 50ms to 85.375 i 2.125
when the SOA is 80ms. When the mask is removed entirely, human performance improves
further to 89.875 ± 1.625. Our results show that the performance of the extended model
increases in a manner similar to the performance of human subjects who were given ad-
ditional time to process the images. This suggests that attention may play an important
role in recognition in clutter. However, the performance for the no-mask condition is not

fully accounted by the attentive processing considered here. The human visual system may
rely upon higher level information that is not available to the model. It is to be noted that
attention in general is not guaranteed to improve recognition performance. In fact, in an
early filtering scheme such as the one described, an object is not detected (no matter how
good the classifier is) if it is not selected by the attention mechanism. Our empirical stud-
ies show that attention can improve recognition only in situations where the features used
for the attentional mechanism are sufficiently decorrelated from those used for recognition.
However, attentional mechanisms always improve the speed of recognition.

Discussion

6.1 
Relation to prior work
A few theories and several specific models (see Table A4 and A5 for an overview and
comparison with our approach) have been proposed to explain the main functional roles
of visual attention and some of its properties. An influential proposal by Tsotos (Tsotsos,
1997) maintains that attention reflects evolution's attempt to fix the processing bottleneck
in the visual system (Broadbent, 1958) by directing the finite computational capacity of the
visual cortex preferentially to relevant stimuli within the visual field while ignoring every-
thing else. Treisman and Gelade (1980) suggested that attention is used to bind different
features (e.g., color and form) of an object during visual perception. Desimone (1998)
suggested that the goal of attention is to bias the choice between competing stimuli within
the visual field. These general proposals, though correct and groundbreaking, do not yield
detailed insights on how attention should be implemented in the visual cortex and do not
yield direct predictions about the various behavioral and physiological effects of attention.
Other, more specific models exist, each capable of modeling a different effect of attention.
Behavioral effects include pop-out of salient objects (Itti et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2008;
Rosenholtz and Mansfield, 2005), top-down bias of target features (Wolfe, 2007; Naval-
pakkam and Itti, 2006), influence from scene context (Torralba, 2003b), serial vs. parallel-
search effect (Wolfe, 2007) etc. Physiological effects include multiplicative modulation
of neuron response under spatial attention (Rao, 2005) and feature based attention (Bichot
et al., 2005). This paper describes a possible unifying framework that defines a compu-
tational goal for attention, derives possible algorithmic implementations and predicts its
disparate effects listed above.
6.2 
Our theory
The theoretical framework of this paper assumes that one goal of vision is to solve the
problem of what is where. Attention follows from the assumption that this is done se-
quentially, one object at a time. It is a reasonable conjecture that the sequential strategy is
dictated by the intrinsic sample complexity of the problem. Solving the 'what' and 'where'

problem is especially critical for recognizing and finding objects in clutter. In a proba-
bilistic framework, the bayesian graphical model that emerges from the theory maps into
the basic functional anatomy of attention involving the ventral stream (V4 and PIT) and
the dorsal stream (LIP and FEF). In this view, attention is not a visual routine, but is the
inference process implemented by the interaction between ventral and dorsal areas within
this bayesian framework. This description integrates bottom-up, feature-based and context-
based attentional mechanisms. The first test for the theory is computational, i.e., whether
it indeed "solves" the basic recognition problem. For this we checked that the attentional
model helps a feedforward model to improve recognition performance in the case of nat-
ural, complex images. We also checked that the theory and the associated model predicts
well human psychophysics of eye-movements (which we consider a proxy for attention) in
a task-free as well as in a search task scenario. In a task-free scenario the model, tested
on real world images, outperforms existing 'saliency" models based on low-level visual
features. In a search task, we found that our model predicts human eye movements better
than other, simpler models. Finally the same model predicts - suprisingly - a number of
psychophysical and physiological properties of attention that were so far explained using
different, and somewhat ad hoc mechanisms.

Methods
In this work, we extend the feedforward model of the ventral stream to include position
information and attentional feedback. The main addition to the original feedforward model
(Serre et al., 2005b) is (i) the cortical feedback within the ventral stream (providing feature-
based attention); (ii) the cortical feedback from areas of the parietal cortex onto areas of the
ventral stream (providing spatial attention) and, (iii) feedforward connections to the parietal
cortex that serve as a 'saliency map' encoding the visual relevance of individual locations
(Koch and Ullman, 1985). The feedforward and feedback information are combined using
a bayesian framework. In the following, we describe the model of the ventral stream as
well as the bayesian extension.
A1.1 
Ventral ('what') stream model
The 'what' stream corresponds to the model described in (Serre et al., 2005b). This model
is representative of the class of feedforward hierarchical models of object recognition. It
builds on previous models (Wallis and Rolls, 1997; Mel, 1997; Riesenhuber and Poggio,
1999b; Ullman et al., 2002; Thorpe, 2002; Amit and Mascaro, 2003; Wersing and Koerner,
2003), conceptual proposals (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968; Perrett and Oram, 1993; Hochstein
and Ahissar, 2002; Biederman, 1987) and computer vision systems (Fukushima, 1975;
LeCun et al., 1998). It was showed (Serre et al., 2005b) to be consistent with experimental
data in V4 (Cadieu et al., 2007) and IT (Hung et al., 2005) (see (Serre et al., 2005b) for
reviews). The model was also shown to be able to fit the performance of human observers
during a rapid animal vs. non-animal categorization task (Serre et al., 2007a), a task which
may likely to rely on bottom-up feedforward processing (VanRullen and Koch, 2003).
Here for simplicity we focused on the part of the model called the 'bypass route', model-
ing the ventral stream in a 4-layer hierarchy corresponding to V1/V2 -+ V4/PIT --+ AIT
(layers S1/C1 
-+ 
S2b -+ 
C2). Details about the model can be found elsewhere (Serre
et al., 2005b). In the following we provide a short description of its implementation. The
ventral stream model is built up using a hierarchy of simple (S) and complex (C) units
(here the term unit is used instead of cell to distinguish the entities in the model from their

counterpart in biology). The S units provide selectivity to specific stimulus while the C
units provide invariance by aggregating information from the afferent S units. Both the
selectivity and invariance exhibited by individual units increases as we go higher up in the
hierarchy. At the highest level we find units that respond to individual object categories at
any location or scale. In this paper, we make use of layers S1, C1, S2 and C2 as outlined in
Serre et al. (2007c). Several other variations of this model exists ( Mutch and Lowe (2006);
Ranzato et al. (2007)).
S1 Units: The SI units are tuned to bars of specific size and orientation. SI unit response
S1 (s,d) (x, y) at scale s and direction d is computed using a normalized convolution opera-
tion
_ 
G(x, y, 6) * I(x, y) 
(Al)
P (x,y) * H(x, y)
Here O(x, y, 0) is the zero mean,unit normal Gabor filters tuned to orientation 0 and H(x, y)
a filter with all ones and the same size as the Gabor filter. The Gabor filters are given by
G(x, y) = exp(U 2o2) 
x cos (7) 
(A2)
and 
= 
cos(6) 
sin(6) 
(A3)
v 
- sin(9) 
cos(0) 
y
Here -y represents the eccentricity/anisotropy of the filter, 0 is the orientation and A is the
wavelength of the filter. In the current implementation, we compute the S1 response at
sixteen different scales and four orientations.
C1 Units: The C1 units pool afferents from several S1 units within its receptive field and
also across adjacent scales using a max operation. This operation done by the C units is
the key to the invariance exhibited by the model, since the C unit responds to the afferent
pattern occurring anywhere within its receptive field and at any scale.
S2 Units: The S2 units respond to simple shapes and have a gaussian-like tuning function

to their preferred stimulus. The response of an individual S2 unit is given by
||C1 - P112
S2i = exp ( 
? 2
) 
(A4)
Here, P represents the preferred stimulus (dictionary elements) that was learnt during
training. The sharpness of the tuning is determined by oi and is designed to provide low
response for blank input.
C2 Units: The C2 cells again pool responses S2 units across 3 x 3 locations and adjacent
scales. The C2 features are used as the bottom-up input data in our attentional model.
A1.2 
Bayesian model
We implemented the bayesian network using Kevin Murphy's bayesian toolbox available
at http: / /bnt .source forge .net.
Integrated model of attention and recognition 
The bayesian model takes as input, the
V4-like (C2) feature maps of the feedforward model of the ventral stream (Serre et al.,
2005b). These are mapped to the X' units in the bayesian model. The X units receives
bottom-up evidence P(IlX). For instance, if features Fi correspond to orientations, the
feature map is computed using oriented Gabor filters (Daugman, 1980). Given the image
I, for each orientation and location, P(I|Xi) is set proportional to the output of the filter.
The response can be passed through a sigmoid or even discretized without affecting the
model. The original ventral stream (Serre et al., 2005b) model used several thousands of
continuous valued shape-based features. In practice, in order to minimize the computa-
tional complexity of the attentional component, a subset of the shape-based features that
are discriminative for the target object category was selected using a mutual information
driven process (Fleuret, 2004). Given the desired number of features, the feature selec-
tion algorithm provides the most discriminatory and mutually independent features to use
and also the corresponding thresholds that maximize the mutual information between the
features and the objects. Using these thresholds, we discretize all the feature maps (Thus,
P(IIX) can be 0 or 1). The next stage in the computation proceeds using message passing

algorithm and is agnostic to the origin of the individual features.
Conditional Probability 
Modeling
P(L) 
Each scene or view-point places constraints on the location
and sizes of objects that can be encountered in the image.
Such constraints can be specified explicitly (e.g. during spa-
tial attention) or learned using a set of training examples
(Torralba, 2003b).
P(FilO) 
The probability of each feature being present or absent given
the object and is directly learned from the training data.
P(X'IF', L) 
When the feature F' is present and location L = l* is active,
the X' units that are nearby unit L = 1* are most likely to
be activated. When the feature F is absent, only the X' = 0
location in the feature map is activated. This conditional
probability can be captured succinctly by the following table
FS = 1,L = l 
F' = 0,L = l
Xi =0 P(XI|Fi, L) 
61 
P(Xi|F', L)= 1 - 62
Xi 
0 
P(Xi|FI, L) 
Gaus- P(Xi|F, L)

sian centered around
L 
= 
1
61 and 62 are small values. They are chosen to ensure that
E P(XI|F', L) = 1.
P(IlXi) 
For each location within the feature map, P(IIX) provides
the likelihood that Xi is active. In the model, this bottom-up
evidence or likelihood is set proportional to the activations
of the shape-based units (see (Serre et al., 2007c)).
Table Al: Description of the model conditional probabilities.
A1.3 
Search and recognition of objects in artificial search arrays
The feedforward recognition component was trained with images of isolated objects. Ad-
ditional (virtual) training examples were generated using translation and scaling of the
original images. Here we used ~ 100 shape-tuned features and a linear SVM for readout
analysis as done in (Hung et al., 2005). A separate classifier was trained for each category
(using the 'one vs. all' strategy).
In the pre-attentive mode, i.e., for recognition in the absence of attention, the entire image
was analyzed by the hierarchical feedforward model. A target was considered detected if
the classifier output for the corresponding object category was positive. To evaluate the

performance of the integrated model of recognition and attention, the attentional compo-
nent was first used to generate attentional spotlights based on local maxima in the saliency
map (corresponding to P(L|I), the posterior probability of location). Processing by the
feedforward model was limited to this region of interest. The corresponding region (and
its immediate surrounding) was then inhibited and the process was repeated until the tar-
get was found or the maximal image saliency fell below a fixed threshold (10% of the
maximum value).

Predicting effects of attention in IT
Data The 16 objects used to create the stimuli are shown in Fig. A3. The stimuli was
generated by placing one or three of these objects in the image. The objects can occupy
only three possible positions in the image that subtended an angle 0',-60' or 60' to the
horizontal. The objects appear at a distance of 5.5' of visual angle from the center of the
image.
Features The objects consist of fruits, couches, face and cars. To extract features that
are responsive to these objects, we used the CSAIL Labelme (Russell et al., 2008) dataset
(855 cars,63 couch, 120 face, 51 fruit images) to derive the feature dictionary. Starting from
a large pool of randomly sampled features, a mutual information driven feature selection
(Fleuret, 2004) was performed to select 60 most informative features. The selection al-

gorithm also provides the thresholds to optimally detect these features. Although this is
far fewer than the number of IT neurons recorded in the original experiment, they respond
more selectively to the set of 16 objects.
Training 
To estimate the probabilities P(FilO) for each object, we used scaled versions
of the 16 objects (corresponding to 16 logarithmically spaced scales between 0.8 and 1.25
times the original size). A feature was assumed to be presented if the value of the feature
map at any location exceeded the threshold obtained during feature selection. P(Fi 10) was
then estimated using the counts. An undesirable effect of having to share all the features
among the objects is that the number of features whose presence indicates the object is far
fewer than the number of features that are usually absent in the object. The absence of
these features provide evidence for the presence of objects. Furthermore, when the target
object is present among other distracters, the desirable features are still present. However,

the presence of distracter features artificially decrease the likelihood of the object being
present. In order to prevent this, we set P(F'l0) = min(0.5, P(F'|0)) such that when
features are likely to be absent in an objects, the probability is modified such that they are
non-informative. The conditional probability matrices before and after this procedure is
shown in Fig. A4.
A1.5 
Attention helps object recognition in complex natural scenes
Feature priors (P(Fil0)) Here we used a dictionary of ~ 100 shape-tuned features.
The features are computed at four different scales corresponding to 0.85x, 0.55x, 0.36x
and 0.23 x the size of the image. Accordingly, the location units span multiple scales (cor-
responding directly with that of Xi). Having multi-scale features allows us to determine
the location as well as the size of the animals. Using a set of 600 training images, the oc-
currence probability of these individual features (P(F'l0)) within animal and non-animal
images was learned.
Location priors (P(L)) Computer vision systems that are based on scanning (Bileschi,
2006; Dalal et al., 2006) do not make any assumption about the scene in which the objects
are found. However, in the natural world, the scene and the objects within it share contex-
tual relationships. Based on this observation, Torralba et al. (Torralba, 2003b) proposed
that a computational model of scene gist could similarly be used to reason about object
probability and position prior to object detection in computer vision applications. Previous
approaches have used gist representations based on spatial distribution of oriented filter re-
sponses (Torralba, 2003b; Itti et al., 2005). In this work, we use biologically inspired shape
descriptors (Serre et al., 2007c) to describe the 'shape' of the scene.
The association between the image and the location (and scale) of animals was learned
using a mixture of regressors (Murphy et al., 2003). Contextual priors were learned in a
way similar to described by Torralba (Torralba and Oliva, 2003). Given a vectorial scene-
gist representation G, the probability of x-location, y-location and scale (X = x, y, o-) is

K represents the canonical view, each of which imposes a different distribution on the ob-
ject location and size. Ak, /-K represent the parameters of the individual regressors. The
weights Wk and the softmax function provide a smooth transition between different con-
straints. P(X|K) specifies the individual regressor for view K. To decrease the learning
time and to avoid over fitting, we reduce the dimension of the individual representations
using PCA. We retain only the top 32 principal components. The number of regressors was
fixed at K = 5 for all representations. Our informal study on the selection of K did not
show any difference for higher values of K. Once P(X G) is obtained, it is transformed
to its discrete counterpart P(L). Admittedly, this procedure is done outside of the bayesian
framework before inference is done.
Recognition 
Given a test image, a multi-scale saliency map (corresponding to the poste-
rior probability of location, P(L|I)) was generated using the bayesian model of attention
(see Fig. A6). The most salient location and scale was then used to generate a spotlight
of attention (the size of the spotlight being determined by the scale of the saliency map
for the corresponding local max). The region within the spotlight was isolated and further
processed by the feedforward hierarchical model for final animal vs. non-animal catego-
rization. Here we only allowed the model to make one shift of attention.

Here we used set of 500 randomly chosen images of outdoor and indoor scenes from the

ages are visually similar to the images used in the actual psychophysics experiment. Sev-
eral hundred shape-tuned features were first extracted via random sampling in these images
(see (Serre et al., 2005b) for details). To speed up the system at run-time, we selected a
small subset of 32 features with the largest variance (which we assume to be the most in-
formative). Here for a fair comparison with the approach by Bruce & Tsotsos, in addition
to the shape features, we included 6 color features corresponding to normalized (z-score)
and half rectified intensities in the LAB color space. Training consisted in determining the
threshold for both color and shape features. We estimated the distribution of each feature
by exhaustively sampling the responses from all the training images. The threshold was
then chosen such that only 20% of the responses would be active (i.e., above threshold)
on average across images. This is equivalent to the 80th percentile value in the estimated
distribution. Choosing a higher threshold produces a sparser saliency map and does not
seriously affect the results.

Search in natural images
Feature priors (P(FilO)) To train the model, we used part of the CBCL Street scene
database (Bileschi, 2006) and part of LabelMe (Russell et al., 2008). We used about 32, 000
training examples (crops) total, which included both cars and pedestrians (about 3, 000 ex-
amples of each). The negative examples were randomly extracted from the database, and
then pruned to exclude regions that overlapped with cars or pedestrians. To train the model,
we started by extracting 1, 000 shape-tuned features randomly sampled from training data
(see (Serre et al., 2005b). Using this data, 200 features were selected using a feature se-
lection process based on mutual information (Fleuret, 2004). Probabilities P(F' 10) were
obtained via maximum-likelihood estimation.
Location priors (P(L)) Here, we consider ~ 500 shape-based units to represent the
scene gist. These units have a larger receptive field compared to the ones used for rep-
resenting objects, but are derived using the same computation (Serre et al., 2007c). The
responses are pooled in a 3 x 3 overlapping grid (each grid corresponding half the width
of the original image) using a max operation. This permits the detection of local image
configurations in a translation invariant manner (Serre et al., 2007c). The resulting 4500
dimensional vector is further reduced to 32 dimensions using PCA. This 32 dimensional
vector represents the "context" of the objects in the scene that can be used to determine
likely locations of objects in the scene. We use a mixture-of-regressors as in (Murphy
et al., 2003) to learn the mapping between the context features and location/scale priors for
each object.
Fig. A7 shows the result of a manifold-learning analysis (Roweis and Saul, 2000) directly
on the output of the |K| = 5 experts trained on the street scenes (each image point is as-
signed to an expert - one color for each expert - by soft-assignment on the corresponding
probability distributions). Visual inspection suggests that the mixture of experts learned
canonical views of the street scenes (e.g. dark blue centers being "side views with build-
ing" while light blue centers represent far views). Overall the analysis reveals that the
shape-based features are able to capture the smooth variations going from one canonical
view to another, thus providing a good representation for the scene.

Figure A7: Visual inspection suggests that centers in the mixture of experts correspond to
canonical street scenes (see text for details).

The neuroscience of visual attention
In this section, we identify the primary regions of the brain involved in attention and their
interconnections. Koch and Ullman (1985) postulated the existence of a saliency map in
the visual system. The saliency map combines information from several abstract feature
maps (e.g., local contrast, orientations, color) into a global saliency measure that indicates
the relevance of each position in the image. Consistent with this hypothesis, models of
attention have assumed that there exist two stages of visual processing. In a pre-attentive
parallel processing mode, the entire visual field is processed at once to generate a saliency
map which is then used to guide a slow serial attentive processing stage, in which a region
of interest (attentional spotlight) is selected for "specialized" analysis. The attentional
spotlight may be guided in several ways. It can be driven by a spatial cue (e.g. "what
object is at the center of the image?") or can be feature/object based (e.g. "where is the
red square?"). Further, attention can be classified as being bottom-up (stimulus driven)
or top-down (task driven). In bottom-up attention, the attentional shifts are purely image
driven and is independent of any task. (e.g. a bright red sign on the street attracts our
attention irrespective of whether we were looking for it). However, the neural correlate of
the saliency map remains to be found.
Prior studies (Colby and Goldberg, 1999) have shown that the parietal cortex maintains
a spatial map of the visual environment and in fact maintains several frames of reference
(eye-centered, head-centered etc) making it a likely candidate for the saliency computation.
Studies show that response of LIP neurons within the parietal are correlated with likelihood
ratio of the target object (Bisley and Goldberg, 2003). In this paper, our hypothesis - which
is not critical for the theory and is mainly dictated by simplicity - is that the saliency map
is represented in LIP. In addition to computing saliency, circuits are also needed to plan the
shifts of attention, that is, to plan and serialize the search by prioritizing candidate shifts
of attention and holding them in working-memory until the saccade has been initiated.
Because of its overlap with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the frontal eye field (FEF) is a good
candidate for shifting the focus of attention. Recent evidence (Buschman and Miller, 2007)
101

further supports the role of FEF in spatial and feature based attention. We speculate that
the FEF stimulation effect reported by Moore and Armstrong (2003) (i.e., an enhancement
observed in V4 receptive field locations that match the region of the visual field represented
at the FEF stimulation site) is indirect, mediated through LIP.
In addition to the parietal region, the ventral stream is also intimately involved in attention.
Li and Snowden (2006); Itti et al. (1998) have proposed computational models based on
V1-like features showing that they are sufficient to reproduce attentional effects such as
pop-out and search asymmetries. However, recent evidence shows Vi to be relatively un-
affected by top-down attentional modulation (Hegde and Felleman, 2003), thus moving the
locus of attention away from VI and towards higher regions such as V4. Experiments on
spatial attention (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999) and feature-based attention (Bichot et al.,
2005) have shown attentional modulation in V4. In particular, feature-based attention is
found to modulate the response of V4 neurons at all locations-the activities are increased if
the preferred stimulus of the neurons is the same as the target stimulus and suppressed oth-
erwise. Under spatial attention, V4 neurons that have receptive fields overlapping with the
locus of attention are found to be enhanced. Thus V4 neurons are involved in feature-based
attention as well as spatial attention suggesting that V4 serves as the area of interaction
between ventral and parietal cortices.
In this work, we explicitly model the interaction between the ventral and parietal cortical
regions (Rao, 2005; Van Der Velde and De Kamps, 2001) and integrate these interactions
within a feedforward model of the ventral stream (Serre et al., 2007c). The main addition
to the feedforward model is (1) the inclusion of cortical feedback within the ventral stream
(providing feature-based attention) and (2) from areas of the parietal cortex onto areas of
the ventral stream (providing spatial attention) and, (3) feedforward connections to the
parietal cortex that serve as a 'saliency map' encoding the visual relevance of individual
locations (Koch and Ullman, 1985). The model is directly inspired by the physiology of
attention and extends a bayesian model of spatial attention proposed by Rao (2005).

A2.2 
Computational models of attention
Several theoretical proposals and computational models have been described to try to ex-
plain the main functional and computational role of visual attention. One important pro-
posal by Tsotsos (1997) is that attention reflects evolution's attempt to fix the processing
bottleneck in the visual system (Broadbent, 1958) by directing the finite computational ca-
pacity of the visual system preferentially to relevant stimuli within the visual field while
ignoring everything else. Treisman and Gelade (1980) suggested that attention is used to
bind different features (e.g. color and form) of an object during visual perception. Dun-
can (1995) suggested that the goal of attention is to bias the choice between competing
stimuli within the visual field. These proposals however remain agnostic about how atten-
tion should be implemented in the visual cortex and do not yield any prediction about the
various behavioral and physiological effects of attention.
On the other hand, several computational models have attempted to account for specific be-
havioral and physiological effects of attention. Behavioral effects include pop-out of salient
objects (Itti et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2008; Rosenholtz and Mansfield, 2005), top-down
bias of target features (Wolfe, 2007; Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006), influence from scene
context (Torralba, 2003b), serial vs. parallel-search effect (Wolfe, 2007) etc. Physiological
effects include multiplicative modulation of neuron response under spatial attention (Rao,
2005) and feature based attention (Bichot et al., 2005). Table A4 provides a comparison of
our approach with existing work in literature.
A2.3 
Other approaches for modeling human eye movements
Our work builds on a number of computational (Tsotsos et al., 1995; Itti and Koch, 2001 a;
Rao et al., 2002b; Torralba et al., 2006; Walther and Koch, 2007) and conceptual proposals
(Wolfe, 2007) that have been suggested over the years to explain visual search tasks (see
(Walther and Koch, 2007) for a recent review). Work on modeling visual attention most
related to our approach can be characterized based on the type of cues that are used and
how they are combined
Studies have shown that image-based bottom-up cues can capture attention, particularly

during free viewing conditions. Locations where stimulus differs significantly from rest
of the image is said to 'pop-out'. In (Itti et al., 1998), center-surround difference across
color, intensity and orientation dimensions is used as measure of saliency. In (Gao and
Vasconcelos, 2007), self information of the stimuli (- log(P(I))) is used as measure of
distinctiveness (Zhang et al., 2008). In (Rosenholtz, 1985), the normalized deviation from
mean response is used instead. Spectral methods for computing bottom-up saliency have
also been proposed (Hou and Zhang, 2007). These models, however, cannot account for
the task-dependency of eye movements (Yarbus, 1967). Depending on the search tasks,
human eye movements may differ substantially-even when the stimuli are identical
A seminal proposal to explain how top-down visual search may operate is the Guided
Search model proposed by Wolfe (Wolfe, 2007) according to which the various feature
maps are weighted according to their relevance for the task at hand to compute a solitary
saliency map. Building on Wolfe's model, several approaches have been suggested (Naval-
pakkam and Itti, 2006; Gao and Vasconcelos, 2005; Zhang et al., 2008). Computational
models that use feature-based cues have relied upon low-level features such as color, con-
trast, orientation (Peters and Itti, 2007; Navalpakkam and Itti, 2006) that are too simple
for real-world object-based visual searches. These models also ignore the role of spatial
attention. In situations where the location of the target is explicitly cued, the role of spa-
tial attention cannot be overlooked. In (Desimone, 1998), it was shown that activity of V4

Table A5: A summary of the differences between different approaches to model attention
and eye movements. The various approaches are compared based on the type of cues that
are used to derive a saliency map, how those cues are combined and whether the work was
evaluated on real-world images. 'BU' column indicates if bottom-up cues are used, 'Loc'
(location) and 'Sc' (scale) columns indicate if contextual cues are used to predict object
location and scale respectively. The 'Feat' (feature) column indicates if the model relies on
top-down feature cues. 'RW' (real-world) shows if the model has been evaluated on real
world images. In cases where multiple cues are combined, 'Comb' (combination) indicates
if the combination is bayesian ('Bayes') or linear ('Lin').
neurons are reduced when multiple stimuli are present within its receptive field. However,
when a specific location is cued and subsequently attended, the neurons at the attended
locations are selectively enhanced. The neuron responds as if there is a single stimulus
within the receptive field. In (Rao, 2005), a bayesian model of spatial attention is proposed
that reproduces this effect. Our work can be viewed as an extension of this approach. In
addition to direct cueing, spatial cues may also be derived indirectly, by context, in natu-
ral scenes. Spatial relations between objects and their locations within a scene have been
shown to play a significant role in visual search and object recognition (Biederman et al.,
1982). In (Oliva et al., 2003), Oliva, Torralba and colleagues showed that a combination of
spatial context and bottom-up attention could predict a large fraction of human eye move-
ments during real-world visual search tasks in complex natural images. With the exception
of (Ehinger et al., 2009), computational models have not considered the interaction be-
tween spatial, bottom-up and top-down attentional effects. Table A5 provides a succinct
comparison of our approach with existing work in literature.
