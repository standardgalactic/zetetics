Abstract.
Is there a single linearly evolving Wave Function of the Universe that is able to
lead to all the nonlinearities we see around us? This proposal seems a priori highly implausible.
I claim that instead, in the real Universe, generically only local wave functions exist. Non-local
wave functions occur for carefully engineered contexts such as Bell experiments, but there is no
single wave function for a cat or macroscopic object such as a brain, let alone for the Universe
as a whole. Contextual wave function collapse leads to a defensible version of the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum theory, where classical macro levels provide the context for quantum
events and biological emergence. Complexity arises via multiscale adaptive modular hierarchical
structures that enable logical branching to emerge from the underlying linear physics. Each
emergent level is causally eﬀective because of the meshing of upwards and downwards causation
that takes place consistently with that physics. Quantum chemistry approaches in biological
contexts ﬁt this local wavefunction picture.
1. Introduction
This paper reviews three puzzles to do with the way physics relates to emergent reality. They
are to do with quantum physics, with complexity, and with how these relate to each other.
1. The puzzle of quantum linearity
How can the highly non-linear complexity we see
around us arise out of a linear equation for a single wave function of the universe, as some claim?
I propose that in real world applications only local wave functions exist; there is no single wave
function for a living cell, or macroscopic objects such as a cat or brain. Contextual wave function
collapse leads to a defensible version of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory where
classical macro levels provide the context for quantum events. This is discussed in Section 2.
2. The puzzle of complexity So how does complexity arise out of local linear dynamics?
This occurs via adaptive modular hierarchical structures, where each emergent level is causally
eﬀective because of the meshing of upwards and downwards causation that takes place
consistently with the underlying physics via time-dependent constraints.
Such emergent
structures enable logical branching to emerge from the underlying physics via macromolecular
chemistry.
Causal completeness is not a property of physics per se: it only occurs through
closure of constraints involving all linked emergent levels. This is discussed in Section 3.
3. How these relate to each other Given the previous two understandings, in what way
do linear quantum processes underlie biology? They underlie the basic features of the stability
of matter, the nature of the periodic table of the elements, chemical bonding, and the folding of

biomolecules. Essentially quantum eﬀects occur in a few cases (enzyme action, photon detection,
magnetic ﬁeld detection), but the local wavefunction approach advocated here is applicable in
all cases, and leads to the highly non-linear nature of molecular biology that cannot be described
by unitary evolution of a single wave function. This is discussed in Section 4.
4. The meta issue is the domain of application of a theory. This is discussed in Section 5.
2. The puzzle of quantum linearity
Quantum theory [Isham (1995)] [Landshoﬀet al (1997)] is essentially a linear (Hamiltonian)
theory [Silverman (2008)] [Ellis (2012)]. Nowadays it is often claimed (e.g. [Carroll (2022)])
that there is a unitarily evolving wavefunction for the entire universe from which all else follows,
hence all that happens is based in linear evolution of a single wave function .
However the real world is not linear either in terms of structures or associated functions
(Figure 1). How are these features compatible with the claimed linearly evolving underlying
Figure 1. A non-linear world: animals, plants, trees
dynamics of a single quantum wave function? There is a problem somewhere, even if the wave
function lives in a very high dimensional space, or perhaps an inﬁnite dimensional space: there
is clearly a basic incompatibility.
I claim that the solution is that in real world applications, quantum physics applies locally
everywhere, but only local wave functions exist; there is no wave function for a cat or similar
macroscopic objects such as a brain, let alone for the entire universe.
2.1. Linearity and non-linearity of quantum theory
Essential linearity of Quantum theory
The time-dependent ﬁrst order Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ∂|Ψ(t)⟩
∂t
= ˆH |Ψ(t)⟩
(1)
for a wave function |Ψ(t)⟩([Laughlin and Pines (2000)], see also [Isham (1995)], eq.(1.6);
[Landshoﬀet al (1997)], eq.(2.8b)), is linear in |Ψ(t)⟩because it is source-free, and the Hermitian
operator ˆH, which acts linearly on |Ψ(t)⟩, does not itself involve |Ψ⟩. Thus for arbitrary constants
α, β, we have the linearity relation
iℏ∂
∂t{α |Ψ1(t)⟩+ β |Ψ2(t)⟩} = α ˆH |Ψ1(t)⟩+ β ˆH |Ψ2(t)⟩.
(2)
Key features of quantum theory result from this linearity [Ellis (2012)]:

• The use of a complex Hilbert space formalism [Isham (1995)],
• Time reversible Hamiltonian evolution if ˆH is time independent [Cappellaro (2012)],
• Interference between quantum entities, as in the 2-slit experiment [Feynman et al (1965)],
• Superposition of quantum states [Greenberger et al (1993)], [Silverman (2008)],
• The possibility of coherence [Streltsov et al (2015)],
• Entanglement ([Isham (1995)] §8.4), [Vedral (2014)],
• Unitarity of the S-matrix in scattering processes [Weinberg (2002)],
• The possibility of using a path integral approach [Feynman et al (2005)],
• Fermi-Dirac statistics ([Landshoﬀet al (1997)]:134-137), resulting from the Pauli exclusion
principle [Dirac (1926)],
• Bose-Einstein statistics [Ziﬀet al (1977)].
Essential and inessential nonlinearities of quantum theory There are of course also
some non-linear features of quantum theory. I classify these as inessential or essential.
Inessential nonlinearity: Non-linearities in the Hamiltonian ˆH do not disturb the linearity
relation (2). On expanding eiH in a power series, these non-linearities result in the possibility
of using Feynman diagrams [Feynman et al (2005)] as a calculational tool to solve (1). As the
name implies, the ‘virtual particles’ represented in such diagrams are not real particles, they are
rather a conceptual aid in carrying out calculations. Despite the complexity of these diagrams,
the wave function is still propagated linearly.
Essential nonlinearity 1: Unless the initial state is already an eigenstate, wave function
collapse to an eigenstate takes place ([Isham (1995)]: §8.3, §8.5), with probabilities of a speciﬁc
eigenstate and associated eigenvalue being given by the Born Rule ([Landshoﬀet al (1997)]:
pp.43-44, [Atkins and Friedmann (2011)]: p.23). This process is non-linear and irreversible, so
it cannot be described by the linear equation (1) and information is generically lost [Ellis (2012)].
This happens all the time in the real world as photons impinge on a screen or on a CCD in
a camera or on chlorophyll or rhodopsin molecules, as radioactive atoms decay, as chemical
reactions take place, etc. It occurs in laboratory situations when measurements are made, but it
is not generically associated with such a context: it need not be a ‘measurement’ in that sense.
Some presentations of quantum theory simply ignore this non-linearity, claiming that
quantum theory is always unitary; but without it there is no point in knowing the wave function,
as then no experimentally determinable outcomes are predicted by the theory.
There are alternatives that try to avoid this non-linearity, particularly a many worlds
view (the Everett interpretation) where such collapse never happens ([Isham (1995)]: §8.5.4),
sometimes extending to a ‘many minds’ view, often proclaimed in popular expositions. Why
is this proposed?
- it’s an extended attempt to claim that only linear dynamics (1) occurs
[Carroll (2022)]. However then deriving the Born rule for probabilities of outcomes, which we
determine experimentally to be the case in the real universe, is problematic. A key technical
problem for these theories is the non-uniqueness of relative states ([Isham (1995)]:157-159). It
is also in my view inconceivable that registering a single photon on a single screen in one
laboratory splits the entire universe in two, right up to the Hubble radius (and beyond?). Any
‘many minds’ interpretation ([Isham (1995)]:157) [Butterﬁeld (1996)] is unviable because, apart
from any other problems, there is no single wave function for a brain (see below). Tegmark’s
many varieties of multiverses are critiqued in [Butterﬁeld (2014)].
There are also hidden variable/pilot wave theories ([Isham (1995)]:160), [Valentini (2009)]
that avoid wave function collapse, with randomness of outcomes being due to the unknown
values of hidden variables. They were initially crafted so that their outcomes would be identical
to those of standard quantum theory ([Bohm (1957)]:110), but Bell’s work led to a variety of
proposed tests of those theories e.g.
[Simon et al (2001)], [Mahler et al (2016)].
However if

these variables do indeed exist, we have no access to their values except immediately after an
experiment (when also the standard theory gives unique outcomes: the same eigenvalue and
eigenvector as just measured). Their postulated existence makes no diﬀerence to the quantum
mechanics impossibility of generically making unique predictions of experimental results from
determinable initial data (“One cannot even in principle know the hidden variable values”
[Genovese (2005)]:376). In any case, these theories do not feature in standard quantum chemistry
texts [Buyana (1997)] [Kohn (1999)] [Atkins and Friedmann (2011)], [Karplus (2014)], which
develop from the standard approach [Landshoﬀet al (1997)], so I will not consider them further.
I instead support the idea of classical outcomes arising by Contextual Wavefunction Collapse
[Drossel and Ellis (2018)].
This is in essence a version of the Copenhagen interpretation
where the measurement apparatus can be regarded as classical, as experienced in practice
by physicists [Bub (2017)].
It is supported by Bohr’s idea of the property of a quantum
system having a meaning only within the context of a speciﬁc measurement situation, as
suggested also by the Kochen-Specker Theorem ([Isham (1995)]:p.167), as elaborated recently
in [Landsman (2017)]. Real quantum measurements are complex multi-stage aﬀairs that are
crucially context-dependent ([Drossel and Ellis (2018)]:§2), [Drossel (2023)].
Essential nonlinearity 2: The dual process to measurement is state vector preparation,
which is also non-unitary.
The key feature of quantum state preparation is pointed out by
Isham as follows ([Isham (1995)]:74,134): selected states are drawn from some collection Ei of
initial states by a suitable apparatus, for example selected to have some speciﬁc spin state, as in
the Stern-Gerlach experiment; the other states are discarded. Again it is a non-linear contextual
process due to the nature of the relevant apparatus ([Ellis (2012)]:§.5.2.6).
Essential nonlinearity 3: The square in Born’s Rule is a basic quantum non-linearity:
the wave function does not directly give probabilities, but by a square ([Isham (1995)]:5,
[Landshoﬀet al (1997)]:43-44). This is a key diﬀerence between classical and quantum physics,
and is essentially why complex numbers are needed in quantum theory [Renou et al (2021)].
Real world quantum linearities Famously, both superposition and entanglement have
been demonstrated at macro scales.
However to do so, one must prevent non-linear eﬀects
happening, and so need a very carefully engineered context: surfaces must be precisely machined,
interactions with heat baths must be minimized, very low temperatures are usually needed at
considerable cost, decoherence must be fought by isolation.
This is quite diﬀerent than conditions in a biological system such as a living cell
[Allen and Cowling (2011)], or a brain made of networks of billions of cells joined by synapses
[Albright et al (2000)]. No linearity (quantum or otherwise) applies in these contexts.
2.2. Real world macroscopic non-linearities
As emphasized at the start, the real world is highly non-linear at emergent scales. A key example
is feedback control loops (Figure 2). Thousands occur at all levels in biology, where they
Figure 2. Feedback control loop
underlie homeostasis [Modell et al (2015)], for example controlling body temperature, blood

pressure, electrolyte levels, and so on. These systems are key to biological function: you are
ill if the relevant variable is out of range. They are central to much engineering (e.g. aircraft
autopilots and chemical engineering process control) where they are labeled cybernetic systems
[Wiener (1961)] [Ashby (1957)]. Daily life examples are thermostats for temperature control of
water in a water cylinder, or of air in a room.
The general nature of feedback control is shown in Figure 2. A system goal G is set, and
a comparator compares the actual system state S with that goal.
If they diﬀer, a classical
error message E is sent to a controller that takes action to correct that error.
Information
ﬂows through speciﬁcally constructed feedback loops, enabled by the emergent structure of the
system. In the case of a thermostat for a room, the goal is a chosen comfortable temperature T0
set on the thermostat controller. The control circuit in Figure 2 is realised by electrical wiring
that either sends current to the heater, or not, depending on the sensor state; this is a carefully
engineered emergent structure based in the underlying atoms. It’s nature cannot be captured
by coarse graining, as is the case with the kinetic theory of gases.
The outcome is not linear, rather branching dynamics of the following form occurs:
{IF (T < To) THEN (apply heat) ELSE (not)} ⇒{T →T0 > 0}.
(3)
which cannot occur for a linear source-free 1st order ODE [Dawkins (2023)]. Key points are,
• The initial data is irrelevant to the outcome: it is determined by the goal T0;
• The branching dynamics (3) is determined physically by time-dependent constraints
[Juarrero (2002)], namely the way the wires in the electric circuit control the ﬂow of
electrons, depending on the temperature T.
• If heating is needed, the topology of the circuit is closed and current ﬂows. If it is not
needed, the circuit is open and no current ﬂows.The emergent structure thus results in
discontinuous dynamics.
• Hence it is not unitary dynamics : initial states T1 < T0 and T ′
1 = (1/2)T1 lead to the same
outcome T0 > 0 in a ﬁnite time.
• It therefore cannot be described by linear evolution (1) of a single wave function |Ψ(t)⟩
• If the topology of the emergent structure is changed by either disconnecting the wires to the
sensor, or reversing them, the outcome is diﬀerent. In the ﬁrst case, no homeostatic action
takes place; in the second case, the system burns out. All the components are unchanged.
• The setting of the thermostat determines the average speed of motion ⟨v2⟩of molecules
in the room, because they are determined by the temperature T. Thus this is top-down
causation from the emergent macrostructure of the thermostat to the molecules in the room.
A second key example of emergent non-linear systems in biology is contextually-sensitive
oscillators, for example in the heart [Noble (2002)], with the function of pumping blood and
thereby keeping cells alive; thalamocortical oscillations [Steriade et al (1993)]; and adaptive
resonant circuits in the brain, underlying attention, learning, and recognition [Grossberg (2013)].
2.3. Atlases and local wavefunctions
How to reconcile local unitary dynamics (2) with emergent branching dynamics (3)? The key
idea is local quantum wavefunctions. To set the scene I will ﬁrst introduce the idea of local
coordinates as used in in General Relativity theory.
Prolog: GR key idea: Local coordinates. The revolution of global studies in General
Relativity Theory [Hawking and Ellis (1973)] arose via the concept of local coordinates covering
part of a manifold, joined via overlap domains (Figure 3). An atlas covers the manifold globally,
but often no single coordinate system exists for the whole: e.g. this is not possible even in the

Figure 3. A coordinate atlas for local coordinates xi

case of the 2-sphere S2. Use of atlases made global GR studies possible, in particular the study
of horizons in black holes via various coordinate systems and the transformations between them.
QM Resolution:
Local wave functions.
Proposal: Essentially the same applies to
quantum theory: Local wave functions exist everywhere, but no global wave function exists,
nor even a single wave function for most macro objects, e.g. a living cell, a cat, or a brain.
Figure 4. Local wave functions for a feedback circuit
Example:
Feedback control (homeostasis) as in Figure 2.
In this case, local wave
functions would exist and underlie the dynamics in each of the three domains shown in Figure
4, where the dynamics is linear. The fundamental non-linearity of the feedback loop arises by
combining the linear dynamics of local wave functions in each of these domains. Thus there is
generically a patchwork of local wavefunctions valid in local domains, as in Figure 4. Combined,
these cover the system globally, but no single wave function exists for the whole
Each cell in your body has thousands of feedback loops [Allen and Cowling (2011)]. The
dynamics is highly non linear. There is no way a cell can be described by a single wave function
with linear dynamics (1). But local wavefunctions as in Figure 4 will do the job.
Example: Diﬀraction of extended bodies A physics example of this approach is the
case of diﬀraction of extended bodies, presented in [Schutz (2022)].
Heat Baths are fundamental to describing macroscopic systems, but cannot be described
by a many particle wave function [Drossel (2017)]. From the viewpoint just put, the local wave
function domains become so small and so dynamic that it no longer makes sense to separate
them; one should rather use the appropriate classical concepts. [Drossel (2020)] explains:
“The Schr¨odinger equation for a macroscopic number of particles is linear in the
wave function, deterministic, and invariant under time reversal.
In contrast, the
concepts used and calculations done in statistical physics and condensed matter physics

involve stochasticity, nonlinearities, irreversibility, top-down eﬀects, and elements from
classical physics. This paper analyzes several methods used in condensed matter physics
and statistical physics and explains how they are in fundamental ways incompatible with
the above properties of the Schr¨odinger equation. The problems posed by reconciling
these approaches to unitary quantum mechanics are of a similar type as the quantum
measurement problem.
This paper, therefore, argues that rather than aiming at
reconciling these contrasts one should use them to identify the limits of quantum
mechanics. The thermal wavelength and thermal time indicate where these limits are
for (quasi-)particles that constitute the thermal degrees of freedom.”
This view is strengthened by the fact that a cell is a very dynamic context: topological turbulence
occurs in the membrane of a living cell [Tan et al (2020)], molecular machines extract order from
chaos [Hoﬀmann (2012)], and the brain is an essentially noisy organ [Rolls and Deco (2010)].
Summary
1. Quantum physics applies locally everywhere via local wavefunctions, but does not apply
globally with a single wavefunction.
2. Local wavefunctions are restricted to domains where the dynamics is linear [Ellis (2012)].
3.
This split cannot be characterised simply in terms of energy or length scales:
it is
contextually dependent, for example suﬃcient isolation of a system to avoid decoherence.
4. Non-linear dynamics arises by combining local linear dynamics in non-linear ways.
2.4. Local wave functions imply macro objects are classical
This view supplies a suitable context for interpreting what Leggett states:
“It is quite conceivable that at the level of complex, macroscopic objects, the quantum
mechanics superposition simply fails to give a correct account of the dynamics of the
system” ([Leggett (1991)]):98).
Isham conﬁrms this possibility ([Isham (1995)]:149):
“A macroscopic subsystem (or ensemble of such) may not be describable by any state
at all, not even a linear superposition of eigenstates”.
Figure 5. Bell test: Alain Aspect (adapted from [Aspect (2015)] by Mandy Darling).
This leads to a defensible version of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum theory. Any
measuring apparatus is classical, as in the traditional view supported by Bohr: “The measuring
device is located ﬁrmly in an external classical world, thereby opening an irreducible gap between

the quantum system and the instrument of observation ([Isham (1995)]: p.132). One cannot
describe it in terms of a single wave function because its dynamics are not linear, and because
as it is macroscopic, in thermodynamic terms it contains eﬀective heat baths which cannot be
represented by a multiparticle wavefunction [Drossel (2017)], [Drossel (2020)].
Example: Aspect’s paper on the Bell test [Aspect (2015)], see Figure 5. All is classical:
the source, beam splitters, detectors, coincidence detectors), except a few interacting particles
(ν1 and ν2). All the rest are conceived of and described in classical terms. To describe them in
quantum terms would make the analysis impossible (inter alia, the elements of the apparatus
would have no deﬁnite state).
Schr¨odinger’s cat In particular [Silverman (2005)], there is no single wave function for a
cat as a whole, made of many living cells . As stated in [Silverman (2008)] (p.26)):
“[..] not everything can be ascribed a wavefunction. Cats, rabbits, chickens, and other
ludicrous examples of ﬂora and fauna, which have been employed in popular accounts
of quantum mysteries, do not have wave functions .”
Thus because there is no wave function |Ψcat⟩, the proverbial
|Ψcat⟩= α|Ψalive⟩+ β|Ψdead⟩
(4)
is not a legitimate equation, as none of these wave functions exist! The only quantum feature
in a typical diagram of the Schr¨odinger’s cat setup is the set of excited atoms that trigger the
detector in a random way. Everything else - the cage, the detector, the poison vial, the hammer
that breaks it - is classical, including the cat.
2.5. Is there a wave function for the universe?
No, there cannot exist single wave function |Ψuniverse⟩for the universe as a whole, because
heat-baths and cats exist in the universe, as do vast numbers of living cells, each containing
thousands of feedback loops.
This statement undermines a vast amount of writing concerning alleged outcomes of the
existence of such a wavefunction. Of course the idea was originally applied to minisuperspace,
where only cosmological degrees of freedom were considered [Wiltshire (1996)]. This is a far cry
from the way it is used today, with |Ψuniverse⟩supposed to apply to everything including brains,
and there is much talk of minds splitting in two because of the Everett interpretation.
Astrophysical and idealised black holes Is there a single wave function for a black hole? In
the case of realistic astrophysical black holes, there are many non-linear processes taking place,
with heat baths involved [Begelman and Rees (2020)]. The answer will surely be no. Whether
there can be a single wavefunction for an idealised black hole, as envisaged in the huge literature
on the “information paradox”, would seem to be a moot question. From the viewpoint of this
paper, that assumption needs to be justiﬁed.
3. The puzzle of complexity
How does this all relate to complex systems such as life, digital computers, aircraft, cities?
These are all associated with function or purpose, whereas there is no purpose in physics
[Hartwell et al (1999)], ([NAS (2022)]:17,47-48).
How does this arise out of physics?
Via
conformational properties of macromolecules in modular hierarchical structures:
change of
shape of macromolecules, enabled by quantum chemistry eﬀects [Karplus (2014)], underlies
biological function at higher levels [Lehn (2004)] [Lehn (2007)].
Time dependent constraints
enable branching dynamics to emerge, as in the case of feedback control loops (eqn.(3)).

3.1. The Hierarchy of Structure and Causation
Complex systems such as life, digital computers, aircraft, cities, are multiscale adaptive modular
hierarchical structures [Ellis (2016)] [Martins et al (2010)], where each word is important.
Why structures? Because that is how desired function emerges [Brewer and Burrow (1972)]:
eyes enable seeing, lungs enable breathing, and so on. Even proteins have functions enabled by
their structure, see Protein Structure and Function [Petsko and Ringe (2004)]. One can alter-
natively emphasize the processes carried out by these structures, which are indeed central to
function [Dupr´e and Nicholson (2018)] - but no processes can occur without the structures.
Why modular? The basic principle for handling a complex task is, break up the complex
task into simpler tasks; create modules - semi-autonomous parts - to handle the simpler tasks;
then merge the outcomes to complete the complex task. This allows abstraction, information
hiding, and encapsulation [Booch (1990)]. It furthermore allows evolutionary development of
modules, with inheritance: existing modules are adapted, with modiﬁcations, to fulﬁll new
functions. Indeed this is the only way to develop truly complex systems [Simon (2019)].
Figure 6. Branching Physics in a Biological Context Branching biological logic chains
down to cause the underlying physical dynamics to branch From [Ellis and Kopel (2019)].
Why hierarchical?
Emergent levels, each with a diﬀerent nature, naturally result on
combining modules to give a multiscale structure.
The hierarchy of emergence for biology
[Rhoades and Pﬂanzer (1989)] [Martins et al (2010)] is shown in Figure 6. There is a higher
level of society, and lower levels of underlying physics (quarks, gluons; maybe strings). For
practical purposes, the level of protons, neutrons, and electrons is the lowest level that counts for
everyday life [Laughlin and Pines (2000)]. Each level handles diﬀerent kinds of tasks, supporting
other levels. Each level is needed for the whole to work, which is the true nature of causal closure
[Mont´evil and Mossio (2015)] [Ellis (2020)]. Each level is equally signiﬁcant for the functioning
of the whole; none is more fundamental than any other [Noble (2012)].
The hierarchy is multiscale over many orders of magnitude, with huge numbers of particles
constituting huge numbers of cells that together make up the whole [Martins et al (2010)].
Multiple realisability takes place as causation chains down from higher to lower levels:
many lower level elements can give essentially the same higher level outcome, and this degeneracy
is huge at the genotype level [Wagner (2014)]. Relation to function is hidden at this level.

Why adaptive? The system must be able to respond eﬀectively to the environment, which
will generically be of a dynamic nature and require diﬀerent responses at diﬀerent times and
places in order to navigate it safely, obtaining energy and information as required [NAS (2022)].
3.2. Emergence of higher eﬀective levels
Emergence takes place over three diﬀerent timescales: short term (function), medium term
(development), and long term (evolution). Multiple realisability applies in all these cases.
Functionally, diﬀerent descriptions, variables, and eﬀective laws apply at each emergent
level at each time, because symmetry breaking occurs between levels [Anderson (1972)].
In
functional terms, the levels are linked by upward emergence due to coarse graining, explicit
symmetry breaking, or black boxing, and by downward causation [Ellis (2016)] due to time
dependent constraints [Juarrero (2002)], together with the ability of higher levels to create,
modify, or delete lower level elements (‘machresis’, [Gillett (2017)]), leading to the idea of
“understanding the parts in terms of the whole” [Cornish-Bowden et al (2014)], as for example in
proteostatic regulation in neuronal compartments [Giandomenico et al (2022)]. Here causation
is deﬁned as diﬀerence making [Menzies and List (2010)].
These dynamics together enable same level causation to occur at every emergent level
[Noble (2012)], expressed by eﬀective laws that apply at that level [Ellis (2020a)]. These laws
generically exhibit contextually determined logical branching of the form,
IF T(X) THEN F1(Y ) ELSE F2(Y ),
(5)
where Y is a dynamic variable at level L and X is a control variable at level L or level L+1. Such
contextual branching is the key diﬀerence between physics and biology [Ellis and Kopel (2019)],
enabling function to emerge [Hartwell et al (1999)].
Homeostasis such as (3) is a case of
such branching due to time dependent constraints.
Metabolism [Fell (1997)] is an example
of machresis in physiology and cells, as are brain plasticity eﬀects associated with memory via
gene regulation [Kandel (2001)] which determine what proteins will be present.
Developmentally emergence takes place over timescales of between minutes to decades
as an organism develops from a single cell to a cooperative ensemble of 1011 to 1013 cells of
diﬀerent types. The nature of the cells present at each place in the organism is determined by
developmental processes [Wolpert et al (2009)] controlled by positional information conveyed by
morphogens in the ecological context [Gilbert (2001)]. This is a crucial form of machresis.
In evolutionary terms, natural selection [Darwin and Wallace (1958)] [Mayr (2001)]
takes place over geological or shorter timescales, depending on the reproduction timescale.
Reproduction with variation, followed by natural selection of phenotypes with a relative
reproductive advantage in a speciﬁc ecological context, leads to selection of genes producing
proteins that result in existence of phenotypes better suited to the environment, naturalistically
explaining apparent design. The selection principle is relative reproduction success.
Downward causation takes place because diﬀerent environments result in diﬀerent outcomes
[Campbell (1974)].
Thus for example bears have adapted diﬀerently to Arctic snow (polar
bears) vs Canadian forests (brown and black bears), so that they will in each case be able to
hunt without being conspicuous. Thus these diﬀerent contexts result in diﬀerent genes (DNA)
resulting in changed proteins resulting in diﬀerent fur colour. The selection causal chain is
Environment ⇒Selected Organisms ⇒Selected Proteins ⇒DNA sequence.
(6)
Other examples are given in [Wagner (2014)]: ecological advantage acts down to select preferred
proteins via associated genes. This is clearly multilevel selection, with a crucial feature:
Selection shapes all emergent levels LI in Figure 6 simultaneously.
It has to do
so, because they all work together to enable the organism to function [Noble (2012)]
[Ellis (2020)]. Selection is not conﬁned to either the gene level or the organism level.

Three closing comments follow, regarding neutral evolution, the ‘Evo-Devo’ viewpoint, and
major evolutionary transitions.
Neutral evolution Essentially as a result of the huge multiple realisability occurring in the
process (6), some population geneticists claim that non-adaptive neutral evolution, resulting
from genetic drift, almost always takes place rather than adaptive selection [Kimura (1983)],
[Mu˜noz-G´omez et al (2021)]. Underlying this view is a deﬁnition of “function” based in selection
of DNA segments (“Functional DNA is DNA that is currently under purifying selection - it is
being maintained by natural selection” [Moran (2023)]), rather than deﬁning function in terms of
physiological or ecological relations, as in [Hartwell et al (1999)], [Ellis (2020a)], [NAS (2022)].
This results in the paradox of these workers in eﬀect denying the central achievement of
evolutionary theory, namely the explanation of apparent design [Gardner (2009)]. Evolutionary
theorists studying evolution in relation to physiology, ecology, or behaviour do not take this
view (see e.g. [Wagner (2014)]). This paper adopts the organisational deﬁnition of function
[Mossio et al (2009)], [Farnsworth et al (2017)], ([Ellis and Kopel (2019)]:§1.3).
Evo-Devo In reality, evolutionary and developmental aspects interact with each other. It is
developmental systems that make it possible for an organism to exist [Gilbert (2001)], so it is
they in particular that are selected by evolutionary processes [Oyama et al (2001)]. Their action
then alters evolutionary outcomes, leading to the Evolution-Development interaction (Evo-Devo)
view of the dynamics taking place [Carroll (2005)], [Carroll (2008)]. In this way gene regulatory
networks are selected that enable more complex logic (AND, OR, NOT, and so on) to emerge
[Jacob and Monod (1961)], [Monod et al (1963)] via cell signalling processes [Berridge (2007)].
Major transitions in evolution [Smith and Szathmary (1997)] correspond to new ways of
transmitting information between generations, perhaps new levels of cooperation (entities that
were capable of independent replication before can only replicate as part of a larger whole after),
and in some key cases, adding a new level LJ to the hierarchy.
3.3. The key physics-biology link: Supramolecular chemistry
The contextual control of supramolecular shape [Lehn (2004)] is the key physics-biology link.

Voltage gated ion channels An important example is the behaviour of voltage gated ion
channels in axons. This underlies the Hodgkin-Huxley equations [Hodgkin and Huxley (1952)],
resulting in action potential spike chain propagation in neurons [Albright et al (2000)].
The key is the changing conformational shape of the protein ion channels imbedded in the
cell wall, responding to electric voltage across the cell wall. The channel has four paddles that
can change position, seen from the side in Figure 7 and from the top in Figure 8, which move
in response to the voltage across the cell wall. They are closed when the voltage gradient is
outwards (more positive in the exterior), as in Figure 7, so K+ ions cannot enter the cell. They
are open when the voltage gradient is inwards (more positive in the interior), as in Figure 8, so
K+ ions can enter the cell. This is downward causation from the scale of the ion channel to the
scale of the much smaller ion, controlled by the potential gradient across the cell wall.
This context-dependent conformation change enables logic of the form (5) to emerge from
the underlying physics:
IF (outward) THEN (channel closed) IF (inward) THEN (channel open).
(7)
This inﬂow of ions then alters the voltage across the ion channel, so circular causation occurs
[Noble et al (2019)] and underlies the oscillations that create action potential spike chains.
When this occurs in billions of ion channels imbedded in the neural networks of the brain, it
enables propagation of action potential spike chains in neurons [Albright et al (2000)], thereby
enabling existence of adaptive resonant circuits [Grossberg (2013)] and hence underlying the
emergent computational brain [Churchland and Sejnowski (1999)], able for example to calculate
solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation (1) via conditional branching (5). The logical branching
occurring in such thoughts and planning emerges in this way through the modular hierarchical
structure of the brain [Churchland and Sejnowski (1999)], ([NAS (2022)]:144-152).
Such hugely complex molecules with key biological functions came into existence via evolu-
tionary selection [Wagner (2014)]) because of the crucial role they play in enabling intelligence
to emerge, and hence enhanced our ancestor’s survival prospects in the past. All proteins have
functions [Petsko and Ringe (2004)] which have led to their existence via adaptive selection.
Molecular recognition, logic, and information Molecular shape underlies the lock
and key mechanism of molecular recognition [Cramer (1994)] [Berridge (2007)] that in turn
underlies function in supramolecular chemistry [Lehn (2004)] [Lehn (2007)]. Complex chemical
systems arise from components interacting via non-covalent intermolecular forces, underlying the
chemistry of molecular information processing at the supramolecular level through molecular
recognition processes.
Cell signalling [Berridge (2007)] occurs, underlying gene regulatory
networks and metabolic networks [Goelzer et al 2008]. Thus life is based in information use
and logic [Godfrey-Smith (2007)] [Nurse (2008)] [Farnsworth et al (2013)].
3.4. Causal closure
Given this context, causal closure is not a property of the physics level alone, as is often claimed.
Because of the conﬂuence of upwards and downwards eﬀects, it occurs only in the context of
the interacting whole depicted in Figure 6 via causal closure of constraints [Mossio et al (2013)]
[Mont´evil and Mossio (2015)] [Ellis (2020)]. In the case of digital computers, for example, it
includes the reasons why an algorithm was written that is controlling ﬂow of electrons through
gates [Ellis and Drossel (2019)]. In the case of the functioning of biomolecules via the quantum
physics of supramolecular chemistry [Karplus (2014)], it includes the ecological reason for that
molecule existing, for example the functioning of antifreeze proteins that enable the arctic cod
to survive in waters that regularly chill below 0 C ([Wagner (2014)]:107). The laws of physics by
themselves, e.g. Maxwell’s equations, do not determine any speciﬁc outcomes whatever. Rather
they determine the possibility space within which such outcomes arise [Adlam (2022)].

In summary: “The complement of reduction is emergence. While reduction considers how the
whole can be explained in terms of its parts, the concept of emergence considers the qualitatively
new properties of the whole, which are not properties of the parts ... The microscopic level of a
system is causally open to inﬂuences from the macroscopic environment” [Drossel (2023)].
4. The role of quantum physics
How does all this relate to quantum physics? In many ways: it underlies the existence and
stability of chemical elements; their nature, as characterised by the periodic table of the elements;
the existence and nature of chemical bonds that enable polymer chains to exist and underlie
supramolecular chemistry, with its logical branching underlying biological signal processing
[Karplus (2014)]. Time dependent constraints occur [Juarrero (2002)], so the Hamiltonian is
no longer time-independent:
ˆH = ˆH(t) [Ellis and Kopel (2019)] and the underlying quantum
evolution based in (1) is therefore no longer unitary, and is not time reversible [Drossel (2020)].
4.1. Nature and stability of chemical elements
Stability of matter arises via the Pauli exclusion principle [Lieb (1976)] [Lieb (1991)].
The
exclusion principle also underlies the existence of electron shells, and hence determines the
Periodic Table of the Elements [Pyykko (2012)] [Scerri (2019)], which is crucial to all biology.
4.2. Quantum chemistry: bonds
Chemical Bonds are ﬁrstly due to electrostatic forces between the valence electrons of atoms
([Buyana (1997)]:186-188), resulting in two types of atomic bonds creating molecules: namely
covalent and ionic. Secondly, there are two types of bonding due to molecular forces: namely
van der Waals bonds and hydrogen bonds. These ultimately arise from the Schr¨odinger equation
(1) applied in a molecular context [Laughlin and Pines (2000)] [Atkins and Friedmann (2011)].
4.3. Quantum chemistry: simple molecules
For polyatomic molecules, one can write a molecular wavefunction that is a combination of
atomic wave functions. Its use to study simple molecules is discussed in ([Buyana (1997)]:§6.)
The description at the microscopic level is based on a Hamiltonian H for nuclei of
mass Mi and atomic number Zi at position Ri and electrons of charge e at position rj
[Laughlin and Pines (2000)] ([Phillips (2012)]:16). It has terms for the kinetic energies of the
nuclei and of the electrons, and for the potential energies of the Coulombic interactions of the
three kinds: nuclei-to-nuclei; nuclei-to-electrons; and electrons-to-electrons:

To derive the wave function from this Hamiltonian the actual molecular structure and
electron charge distribution in the molecule, plus a series of approximations, is required
[Ellis and Drossel (2019)].
The Born-Oppenheimer (adiabatic) approximation ([Atkins and Friedmann (2011)]:258-261)
[McQuarrie (2008)] is used, which assumes that the electrons are at all times in equilibrium with
the positions of the nuclei. The wave function is factorized into an electron part Ψe(r, R) for
given positions of the nuclei, and a nucleus part Φ(R),
Ψ(r, R) = Φ(R)Ψe(r, R) ,
(9)

leading to the electron equation
(Te + Vee + Vei)Ψe(r, R) = Ee(R)Ψe(r,R)
(10)
and the nucleus equation
(Ti + Vii + Ecore + Ee(R))Φ(R) = EΦ(R) .
(11)
This is in fact a mixture of classical and quantum physics ([Drossel (2020)]:222), because the
nuclei are described classically [Born and Oppenheimer (1927)] [Hansen (2022)], rather than just
being a solution of (1). As stated by Hendry, “The Born-Oppenheimer wavefunction looks more
like the solution to an altogether diﬀerent equation: the nuclei are treated classically, and we view
the electrons as constrained by the resultant ﬁeld.” [Hendry (2006)], see also [Bishop (2010)].
A series of further approximations are made to get useful results, including Molecular
orbital theory ([Atkins and Friedmann (2011)]:262-286) and the Hartree-Fock approximation
([Atkins and Friedmann (2011)]:296-316). However this only works for small molecules, as Kohn
stated in his Nobel lecture [Kohn (1999)], awarded for his work on density functional theory:
“Traditional multi-particle wave-function methods when applied to systems of many
particles encounter what I call an exponential wall when the number of atoms N exceeds
a critical value which currently is in the neighborhood of N0 ≃10 (to within a factor
of about 2) for a system without symmetries”.
Density Functional Theory (DFT). Because of this computational complexity of the
many-body Schr¨odinger equation, a solution is beyond reach for larger molecules.
DFT
([Atkins and Friedmann (2011)]:317-326) sidesteps this problem by making the electron
density distribution n(r) rather than the many-electron wave function play a central role
[Hasnip et al (2014)]. Underlying this is the claim [Hohenberg and Kohn (1964)] that the total
energy of the system is a unique functional of the electron density alone, so it is not necessary to
compute the full many-body wave function. The approach is a mixture of classical and quantum
methods ([Drossel (2020)]:223). However even this method will not work for macro molecules.
4.4. Quantum chemistry: macro molecules
The number of atoms in a macromolecule [Lehn (2007)] is vastly larger than 10. To handle their
complexity requires multiscale models. Karplus states in his Nobel lecture [Karplus (2014)],
“To develop methods to study complex chemical systems, including biomolecules, we
have to consider the two elements that govern their behavior: 1) The potential surface
on which the atoms move; and 2) the laws of motion that determine the dynamics of the
atoms on the potential surfaces. ...although the laws governing the motions of atoms
are quantum mechanical, the key realization that made possible the simulation of the
dynamics of complex systems, including biomolecules, was that a classical mechanical
description of the atomic motions is adequate in most cases.”
Thus one does not solve (1) in this case. A classical background provides a basis for the quantum
states. How does this method relate to biological function? Karplus states [Karplus (2014)],
“First, evolution determines the protein structure, which in many cases, though not
all, is made up of relatively rigid units that are connected by hinges. They allow the
units to move with respect to one another. Second, there is a signal, usually the binding
of a ligand, that changes the equilibrium between two structures with the rigid units in
diﬀerent positions. ...This type of conformational change occurs in many enzymes as
an essential part of their mechanism.”

This enables cell signalling [Berridge (2007)] to occur,
underlying metabolic networks
([Wagner (2014)]:§2), [Goelzer et al 2008], gene regulatory networks [Jacob and Monod (1961)]
[Monod et al (1963)] ([Wagner (2014)]:§5), and so developmental systems [Oyama et al (2001)].
Overall this is how information is important at this level in biology [Nurse (2008)].
A central issue here is, how does the classical concept of shape, key to occurrence of
these processes [Lehn (2004)] [Lehn (2007)], arise out of quantum theory? This is discussed
in ([Ramsey (1997)], [Bishop and Ellis (2020)]:§5.2).
Molecular shape is generated by the
environment [Amann (1991)] [Amann (1993)].
Biochemistry cannot be reduced to physics
[Bishop (2005)] [Bishop (2010)] because microbiology interactions based in molecular shape is
key in the molecular biology of the gene [Watson et al (2013)] and the cell [Alberts et al (2018)].
These emergent processes reach down to coordinate interactions of proteins, RNA, and DNA.
Overall, these studies in the quantum chemistry of biomolecules conﬁrm the view put here:
the quantum dynamics determined by the linear equation (1) is a locally valid description but
does not apply even to complex biomolecules as a whole, much less to living cells or other
biological structures. Their highly non-linear structure and function is enabled by local wave
functions everywhere, but not by a single wave function that applies on macro scales.
4.5. Quantum circuits and qubits
A new development is simulation of molecules using superconducting quantum processors based
in Kitaev-Heisenberg models and highly non-linear quantum circuits ([Tazhigulov et al (2022)],
see eqn.(2) and Figure 2). Does this undermine what has been stated above? Is there a single
wave function determining this dynamics?
No, because critical to implementing a quantum
computer is the ability to control the state of the qubit. A quantum algorithm is speciﬁed as a set
of unitary transformations {U1, U2, U3, ..., } that are implemented by a sequence of Hamiltonians
{H1, H2, H3, ..., } that are turned on and oﬀone after the other [DiVincenzo (2000)]. This is
done [McKay et al (2017)] by a local oscillator shaped by an Arbitrary Waveform Generator
(AWG) which outputs a programmable voltage output V (t) via the classical components shown
in Figure 1 of that paper.
This controls rotations of the Bloch sphere.
Thus the quantum
processes involved are controlled in a top-down way by classical components with non-linear
branching dynamics, in agreement with this paper.
4.6. Essentially quantum eﬀects (coherence, entanglement, tunneling) in biology
Essentially quantum eﬀects in biology are considered in [Arndt et al (2009)] [Lambert et al (2013)]
[Marais et al (2018)] [McFadden and Al-Khalili (2018)] [Cao et al (2020)] [Kim et al (2021)]
[Smith et al 2022] and [NAS (2022)]. Claims in this regard must be treated with caution: there
is some very questionable stuﬀout there, particularly because the brain is warm and wet, so
decoherence is ubiquitous [Tegmark (2000)]. The brain is therefore probably not a quantum
computer [Tegmark (2000a)].
Essentially quantum eﬀects claimed are,
1.
Magnetic ﬁeld detection by birds has been claimed to be due to sustained quantum
coherence and entanglement in the avian compass [Gauger et al (2011)], but this must be
analysed in a realistic manner [Smith et al 2022].
2.
Photon to free electron conversion by chlorophyll and rhodopsin molecules is
direct evidence that the process involves quantum mechanical coherence [Engel et al (2007)]
[Collini et al (2010)] ([NAS (2022)]:50-54). Electron transfer in photosynthesis at biologically
relevant
temperatures
depends
on
an
interplay
of
classical
and
quantum
dynamics
([NAS (2022)]:52). However this claim must also be examined in the light of realistic biological
contexts [Cao et al (2020)].

3.
Proton tunneling eﬀects apparently play an important role in enzyme functions
[Masgrau et al (2006)] ([NAS (2022)]:53), which are key in molecular biology.
The brain Overall as regards the brain, [Litt et al (2006)] summarize:
“We argue that computation via quantum mechanical processes is irrelevant to
explaining how brains produce thought, contrary to the ongoing speculations of many
theorists.
First, quantum eﬀects do not have the temporal properties required for
neural information processing.
Second, there are substantial physical obstacles to
any organic instantiation of quantum computation. Third, there is no psychological
evidence that such mental phenomena as consciousness and mathematical thinking
require explanation via quantum theory. We conclude that understanding brain function
is unlikely to require quantum computation or similar mechanisms,”
but see [Fisher (2017)] for a useful survey, and a claim of entanglement processes in memory.
Essentially quantum eﬀects plausibly claimed to exist in the brain are always purely local,
agreeing with the claim (§2.3) that there is no wave function for an organism or brain as a whole.
4.7. Causal closure revisited
How do the time-dependent constraints that underlie downward causation to the physics level
[Ellis and Kopel (2019)] occur? In the context of macromolecular chemistry [Karplus (2014)],
this occurs via the Born-Oppenheimer approximation discussed previously. The positions Ri of
the nuclei in (8) are determined by conformational changes of biomolecules as discussed above:
Ri = Ri(t) ⇒H = H(t)
(12)
and the evolution determined by (1) is no longer time reversible; it is determined by the changing
biological context, where higher level dynamics shape outcomes.
For example, suppose Sue is walking down the street and sees an automobile accident at
time t1. This triggers her brain to determine what happened via computational processes at
the emergent brain level [Churchland and Sejnowski (1999)], thereby shaping her immediately
successive thoughts (“I must call an ambulance”) based in her character (helpful) and previous
knowledge (ambulances bring help). Prior knowledge of the state of every particle in her body
at any time t < t1 cannot predict this outcome of her brain state at times t > t1, because the
accident occurred at an external location: the atoms and electrons in her brain were simply
not involved. Causal completeness based in the total details of her initial brain state is not
possible. Incoming data is handled predictively [Clark (2013)] and shapes the pattern of action
potential spike chains in her brain to reﬂect her choice of action for times t > t1 via a process of
interlevel causal closure involving such spike chains, which are shaped by rational thought that
alters the positions Ri(t) of nuclei in the voltage gated ion channels in her brain, as well as past
experiences that have shaped neural connections ([Drossel (2023)]:§6). Circular causation takes
place [Noble et al (2019)] that involves all these levels, and indeed also the level of society in
which the action is situated, which leads to the existence and functionality of the ambulance.
5. Conclusion
Consideration of the eﬀects discussed here will conﬁrm that the local wavefunction view proposed
in Section 2 gives a correct description of what is going on.
Quantum theory underlies macromolecular chemistry (§4.4), but not by use of the Schr¨odinger
equation (1) for a single wave function [Karplus (2014)]. Even in the case of simple molecules,
and certainly macromolecules, one represents electrons as being inﬂuenced in a downward way
by nuclei that are solved for separately and then used as a classical background for the electron

motions. This is similar to the way electron motions are calculated in solid state physics contexts
such as transistors [Ellis and Drossel (2019)], with a crystal lattice providing a background for
existence of quasi-particles such as phonons that interact with the electrons [Ellis (2020a)].
Essentially quantum eﬀects occur in very few cases (§4.5).
The local wavefunction view put here (§2.3) covers all these cases successfully, and is adequate
to determine how biology arises from physics, in contrast to the proposal [Carroll (2022)] that
there is a single global wave function that will suﬃce to determine the dynamics of everything.
There are local wavefunctions everywhere, but no single wavefunction for complex systems, or
even for any feedback control loops. There is therefore no wave function for cells, hearts, or
brains as a whole. Inter alia, this appears to completely undermine any “many minds” worldview
based in some version of the Everett interpretation [Zeh (1970)] - provided we believe as usual
that mental functions are based in brain operations [Albright et al (2000)].
5.1. Domains of validity
The issue underlying this all is, What is the domain of validity of a theory? The meta issue is,
Each theory has a restricted domain of application.
Newtonian physics is very good within its domain of application; so is Galilean gravity, Newton’s
theory of gravity, Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, Einstein’s theory of gravitation, and
so on. But each has its limits, as is well known; other theories take over outside that domain.
The question not asked often at present is, setting aside the issue of quantum gravity (where
it is indeed often asked),
What is the domain of application of Quantum Theory in a speciﬁc context?
Nowadays it is often taken to be universally applicable at all scales, for example to cats, brains,
and indeed the universe as a whole. But it is no exception to the general rule just stated: its
domain of application is limited too. For example, it does not apply as such to heat baths
[Drossel (2017)] or feedback control (this paper, §2.2, §2.3), cats, or brains (§2.4).
Rather quantum theory is locally applicable everywhere at all times in domains small enough
that the essential dynamics is linear [Ellis (2012)]. Local wavefunctions allow this, as explained in
this paper. Adaptive modular hierarchical structures then enable complex emergence out of these
simple local dynamics (§3); and those structures are classical. There is no single wavefunction
that underlies their existence, particularly because they are multiscale [Martins et al (2010)].
This is true not only in biology but also for example in engineering contexts such as digital
computers [Ellis and Drossel (2019)], and so in aircraft, cellphones and so on. It also applies to
apparatus used in quantum physics experiments: which can therefore be thought of as classical.
5.2. Testing domains of validity
The key question then is,
How does one test the domain of validity of quantum theory in a speciﬁc context?
Constructively, one does so by engineering situations where wave functions are not local, as
in the experiments on entangled photons that won the 2022 Noble Prize in Physics for Aspect,
Clauser, and Zeilinger. In this case violations of Bell inequalities, or quantum teleportation,
established that there was a macroscopic domain of validity for a wave function. But those were
not situations that occur naturally: they were carefully shaped precisely so as to give this result.
The claims of this paper are not negated by a remarkable experiment [Lee et al (2021)] where
a tardigrade - a microscopic multicellular organism known to tolerate extreme physiochemical
conditions via a latent state of life known as cryptobiosis - was entangled with superconducting
qubits. The experiment involved putting the tardigrade in an environment where linearity could

occur, namely a temperature of sub 10 mK temperatures and pressure of 6 × 106 mba, hence
preventing any signiﬁcant interaction with heat baths. No metabolism or feedback loops were
operational in these conditions: the organism was in a state of suspended animation, eﬀectively
being a single frozen crystal. Because of the extraordinary nature of the organism, this did not
destroy its ability to function biologically when reverted to ordinary conditions for life. But it
was never both entangled and functioning biologically at the same time. This situation is of
course highly artiﬁcial, and cannot occur naturally, inter alia because the entire Universe is per-
vaded by primordial black body radiation at a temperature of 2.73K (≫10mK) at the present
time [Hawking and Ellis (1973)]; the requisite temperature can only be created artiﬁcially. From
the viewpoint of this paper, the experiment demonstrates how the domains of validity of wave-
functions for a speciﬁc entity can vary with time, depending on context.
Negatively, unless you believe standard quantum theory to be committed to macrorealism
(agreed on all sides to be an unfortunate name), one can examine cases where standard
quantum theory can be shown to be invalid, as in the case of the Leggett-Garg inequalities
[Leggett and Garg (1985)] [Timpson and Maroney (2013)].
Experiments based on these
inequalities can be carried out to rule out quantum macrorealism, as for example in
[Knee et al (2012)]. This establishes the principle of tests for macrorealism in larger system.
One can also establish no-go theorems pertaining to the existence of long range entanglement
by giving upper bounds to quantum correlations [Kuwahara and Saito (2022)].
There is a community of quantum physicists and philosophers looking at these issues, see for
example [Briggs et al (2013)], [Ares et al (2021)]. I will not attempt an in-depth analysis here;
many of the issues discussed there either directly relate to the proposals of the present paper,
or can be adapted to do so. Perhaps the main thing missing in those papers is an interaction
with the literature on quantum chemistry. This paper ﬁlls that gap to some extent.
5.3. Irreversibility and the direction of time
The Schr¨odinger equation (1) and Hamiltonian (8) are time symmetric, so where does the arrow
of time associated with quantum physics outcomes come from? How does an essentially time
symmetric quantum theory produce the arrow of time in biology?
The basic time asymmetry that occurs in the physical universe is the expansion of the
Universe itself [Ellis (2020b)]. This determines a global Direction of Time that points from
the start of the Universe to the present day.
Together with special conditions in the early
universe [Layzer (1975)] [Albert (2001)], this reaches down to aﬀect all the local arrows of time
(electrodynamic, thermodynamic, wave, diﬀusion, fracture, biological, mental, and quantum)
[Ellis (2014)] [Ellis (2020b)] [Ellis and Drossel (2020)]. The quantum arrow of time arises ﬁrstly
because realistic quantum collapse processes interact with heat baths [Drossel and Ellis (2018)],
and so are time asymmetric [Ellis and Drossel (2020)]. Secondly, local microbiology functioning
aﬀected by the Second Law of Thermodynamics [Eddington (1927)] reaches down to alter
positions of molecules as in (12), and hence changes the Hamiltonian (8) in a time dependent
way. Hence the evolution determined by (1) together with (8), (12), as well as the wave function
collapse process and associated loss of of information, are both time asymmetric [Drossel (2023)].
We can of course measure the passing of time via suitable clocks, and an interesting aspect
is the feedback that occurs as regards the Second Law: any system which measures the passage
of time dissipates entropy at a rate that is proportional to the accuracy of the timekeeping
[Pearson et al (2021)]. This is an emergent classical relation with the correct direction of time.
