daughters, while mothers of large litters 
selectively cannibalize their sons. On 
average, 2M females mature later than 2F, 
have rather smaller litters and differ be-
haviourally in several respects3•4. Could 
the reported differences in sex ratios with-
in day-old litters born to 2M and 2F 
mothers be due to sex-biased cannibaliza-
tion of female pups by 2M and of male 
pups by 2F mothers?

notes first, that androgenization of female 
gerbils gestated between males does not 
provide a sufficient mechanistic explana-
tion of the phenomenon under discussion 
and, second, that differences in the sex-
bias of maternal cannibalism directed to-
wards large and small litters might explain 
the observed result. We agree with Pritch-
ard that androgenization of females fails 
to provide an adequate causal explanation 
of the effects of intrauterine position on 
litter sex ratios. We do not, however, 
believe that our data are consistent with 
Pritchard's suggestion that sex-biased can-
nibalism directed towards litters of diffe-
rent sizes can explain our results1. 
Pritchard errs in stating that litters deli-
vered by dams that gestated between two 
male fetuses (2M females) are rather 
smaller than are litters delivered by dams 
that gestated between two female fetuses 
(2F females). In the paper he cites3, the 
difference in mean size of litters delivered 
vaginally by 32 early- and 36 late-maturing 
gerbils was not statistically significant. In 
the 50 litters born to 2M and 2F females 
studied in ref. 1, the mean size(± s.e.m.) 
of litters delivered by 2M females (6.3 ± 
0.3 pups) did not differ reliably from the 
mean size of litters delivered by 2F 
females (6.7 ± 0.5 pups; Student's t test, 
t( 48) = 0.68, NS). It is difficult to see how 
unreliable differences in litter size could 
cause reliable differences in litter sex 
ratio. 
To address the more general issue of 
effects of perinatal mortality on the sex 
ratios of vaginally delivered gerbil litters, 
we have compared the sex ratios of 
caesarian-delivered litters of 2M and 2F 
female gerbils. To date, caesarian-
delivered litters of 2M female gerbils have 
contained a significantly greater percen-
tage of male fetuses than have caesarian-
delivered litters of 2F female gerbils 
(Mann- Whitney Utest, U = 0, P = 0.05). 
Although our current sample sizes are

small (N = three per group), available 
evidence is not consistent with the hypoth-
esis than any form of sex-biased perinatal 
mortality is responsible for differences in 
the sex-ratios of litters delivered vaginally 
by gerbils gestated in different intrauter-
ine positions. 
Because of the scarcity of 2M and 2F 
females in the relatively small litters pro-
duced by Mongolian gerbils, it will be 
several months before we can complete 
our examination of sex 
ratios of 
caesarian-delivered gerbil litters from 2M 
and 2F females. However, Vanderbergh 
and Huggett (personal communications, 
19 November 1993) find a highly signifi-
cant correlation (P < 0.002) between the 
intrauterine positions in which mouse 
dams (Mus musculus) gestate and the sex 
ratios of their litters. The far greater 
frequency of 2F and 2M female fetuses in 
the large litters of mice than in the small 
litters of gerbils should permit rapid 
progress in determining the causes of 
intrauterine-position effects on the sex 
ratios of rodent litters.

Bayesian quantum

SIR -
Maddox1 writes of "what many 
people have been driving at for the past 
decade, the idea that the probability 
aspects of quantum mechanics should be 
built into the foundations of the subject." 
Wiener and Siegel2 were early ~roponents 
of such a programme. Bohm characte-
rized their ideas as implying "a change of 
possible structures that would perhaps be 
as great as that implied by the change from 
ptolemaic epicycles to newtonian equa-
tions of motion." 
The differential-space theory used by 
Wiener and SJ_e}el has been the basis for 
further work 
. As a consequence of 
these subsequent analyses, one can assert 
(speaking 
in 
terms 
of the finite-
dimensional case) that an n x n density 
matrix (p) of a quantum system is, in 
effect, the covariance matrix of a complex 
multivariate normal (gaussian) distribu-
tion over the vectors (wavefunctions) of 
n-dimensional complex Hilbert space. 
(This can, equivalently, be thought of as a 
covariance matrix in 2n-dimensional real 
space, with a specific form of structure7•8• 
The mean vectors in both the real and 
complex cases are null.) 
There have been few applications of 
Bayes's theorem9 in quantum mechanics10 
-
though it has been used to prove Bell's 
theorem11. The basic impediment has 
been the apparent lack of suitable prior 
distributions over the pure and mixed 
states of quantum systems 10. However -
relying upon the multinormal interpreta-
tion of p -
one can use as prior distribu-
tions those that have been developed for 
this class of distributions. 
In the bayesian inference of the co-
variance 
matrix 
of a 
multinormal 
distribution 12, one can, in the limiting case 
of minimal prior information13, attach a 
vague, Jeffreys, invariant prior, prop-
ortional to IPl2n+ 1, to p (ref. 14). Pure 
states, for which IPI = 0, are, thus, 
assigned null prior probability. In the 
simplest (n = 2, spin-½) case, the im-
proper prior IPl5 has been normalized14, 
so that its integral over the pure and 
mixed states is uni1:X. This normalized 
form is 9,009 (1 - r )5/1 ,024 re, where r 
is the distance of a state from the centre in 
the (Riemann sphere) representation of 
spin-Vz states by the unit ball in three-
space. Normalization is more problema-
tical for n > 2. 
Jones10 had, in fact, applied Bayes's 
theorem to the problem of quantum state 
estimation/determination. 
However, 
prior distributions that were simply uni-
form (unitarily invariant) on the pure 
states, and null on the mixed states were 
used. Jones did make and rely on the 
critical observation that eigenstates onto 
which measurements project should be 
regarded as the realizations of the under-
lying stochastic process. Such realizations 
could be used to form a sample covariance 
matrix, from which one could obtain the 
likelihood and then, by Bayes's theorem, 
the posterior distribution (the product of 
the likelihood and the [multinormal] prior 
ex: IPIZn+l) (refs 9,11,12).
