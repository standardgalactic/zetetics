Preface 
This book is based upon my monograph Index Theory for Hamiltonian Systems with 
Applications published in 1993 in Chinese, and my notes for lectures and courses given 
at Nankai University, Brigham Young University, ICTP-Trieste, and the Institute of 
Mathematics of Academia Sinica during the last ten years. The aim of this book is 
twofold: 
(1) to give an introduction to the index theory for symplectic matrix paths and its 
iteration theory, which form a basis for the Morse theoretical study on Hamilto-
nian systems, and to give applications of this theory to periodic boundary value 
problems of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Here the iteration theory means 
the index theory of iterations of periodic solutions and symplectic matrix paths. 
(2) to serve as a reference book on these topics. 
There are many different ways to introduce the index theory for symplectic paths 
in order to establish Morse type index theory of Hamiltonian systems. In this book, 
I have chosen a relatively elementary way, i.e., the homotopy classification method 
of symplectic matrix paths. It depends only on linear algebra, point set topology, 
and certain basic parts of linear functional analysis. I have tried to make this part 
of the book self-contained and at the same time include all of the major results on 
these topics so that researchers and students interested in them can read it without 
substantial difficulties, and can learn the main results in this area for their possible 
applications. 
In this book, I have introduced numerous examples and more elementary cases 
to indicate the intuitive ideas behind the theorems. For example, the R3-cylindrical 
coordinate representation of Sp(2) and proofs of many results at the Sp(2) level are 
given, and they yield suggestive models and intuitive ideas for the general case. I 
hope this will help readers to understand the material. 
It is my great pleasure to take this opportunity to thank Professor Paul Rabinowitz, 
who introduced me into this amazing area eighteen years ago, and whose perspective 
on this field has greatly influenced my research interest, for his constant encourage-
ment and helps. 
It is also my great pleasure to acknowledge my debt to the following mathematicians 
who have ever encouraged or helped me in various ways: Antonio Ambrosetti, Kung-
Ching Chang, Shing-shen Chern, Han-Ying Deng, Ivar Ekeland, Helmut Hofer, Zixin

Introduction 
The variational structure of Hamiltonian systems was observed more than one hundred 
years ago. But because of its degeneracy, caused by strong indefiniteness, until the 
1970s it had been thought to be useless in the theoretical study of existence of solutions 
of Hamiltonian systems. It was P. Rabinowitz who, in his pioneering work [Rab2] of 
1978, first demonstrated that this degenerate variational principle can be efficiently 
used in the existence study of periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems. Since 
then, a great number of research papers have appeared in this and related areas, and 
many aspects of critical point theory have been applied to the variational study of 
Hamiltonian systems. 
On the other hand, in the study of closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, 
M. Morse in the 1930s successfully developed his index theory. The iteration theory 
of the Morse index for closed geodesics was developed by R. Bott in his celebrated 
work [Botl] of 1956. Based upon their works, many interesting and deep results on 
closed geodesics have been obtained via the Morse index theory. 
Therefore it is natural to consider the problem of applying the Morse theoreti-
cal method to problems involving periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems. In this 
consideration, a major difficulty is that the functionals corresponding to Hamilto-
nian systems are strongly indefinite, which causes the related Morse indices to be 
always infinite. It is important to find certain finite representations of these infinite 
Morse indices. Since 1980, two different index theories for Hamiltonian systems 
have appeared. One index theory was developed by I. Ekeland in the 1980s for con-
vex Hamiltonian systems. A beautiful systematic treatment ofthis index theory was 
given in 1990 in his celebrated book 'Convexity Methods in Hamiltonian Mechanics' 
([Eke3]). The other index theory was defined for periodic solutions of general Hamil-
tonian systems without any non-degeneracy assumptions, and even more generally 
for any paths in the group of symplectic matrices. The current book is devoted to this 
index and its iteration theory as well as their applications. 
Historically, as far as the author knows, the classification and an index theory for 
linear Hamiltonian systems with continuous symmetric periodic coefficients began 
with the work of H. Amann and E. Zehnder in their paper [AmZl] of 1980. They 
established the corresponding index theory for systems with constant coefficients. 
After that many mathematicians worked on this problem. We refer to the papers 
[Chal] of K.c. Chang in 1981 and [LiLl] of S. Li and J.Q. Liu in 1989 for example. 
Since the fundamental solution of a general linear Hamiltonian system with contin-
uous symmetric periodic coefficients is a path in the symplectic matrix group Sp(2n) 
starting from the identity, to be sufficiently flexible such an index theory needs to be 
generalized to any such symplectic paths. Here the symplectic group is defined by 
Sp(2n) = {M E GL(R2n) I MT J M = J}, 

xii 
Introduction 
where J = (~ ~I ), I is the identity matrix on R n, and MT denotes the transpose 
of M. For r > 0, we define the set of symplectic matrix paths by 
P r(2n) = {y E C([O, r], Sp(2n» I y(O) = I}. 
Because Sp(2n) is homeomorphic to the product of the unit circle and a simply 
connected space, a path y E Pr (2n) rotates naturally in Sp(2n) along this unit circle. 
The point here is to find a way to count this rotation so that the rotation number 
represents intrinsically the corresponding Morse index of the related Hamiltonian 
system. For periodic boundary value problems of Hamiltonian systems, because of 
this consideration, we call a path y E Pr (2n) degenerate if 1 is an eigenvalue of 
y(r), and non-degenerate otherwise. 
In their celebrated paper [CoZ2] of 1984, C. Conley and E. Zehnder defined an 
index theory for any non-degenerate path in Sp(2n) with n :::: 2, i.e. the so called 
Conley-Zehnder index theory. This index theory was further defined for the non-
degenerate paths in Sp(2) by E. Zehnder and the author in [LZel] of 1990. The 
index theory for degenerate linear Hamiltonian systems was defined by C. Viterbo in 
[Vit4] and the author in [Lon5] of 1990 independently. Then in [Lon13] of 1997, this 
index theory was further extended to any degenerate path in P r (2n) and an axiomatic 
characterization of the index theory was given. 
In 1990, D. Salamon and E. Zehnder gave the first correct proof in [SaZl] ofthe 
simply connectedness of the subset Sp(2n)j in Sp(2n), where Sp(2n)j contains all 
matrices in Sp(2n) possessing no eigenvalue equal to 1. This fact was used in the 
definition of the index theory in [CoZl] for the non-degenerate case. 
In this book, we denote this index by 
(i\(y), v\(y» E Z x {O, 1, ... , 2n}, 
Vy E Pr (2n). 
In fact, there are infinitely many ways to define index theories for paths of 
symplectic matrices. A definition of the index theory for symplectic paths is mean-
ingful if it can be applied to different problems. Here the crucial point for our 
index theory is its relation with the Morse index theory of general Hamiltonian sys-
tems, i.e., Theorem 6.1.1 below in this book with w = 1, which was proved by 
C. Conley, E. Zehnder, and the author in [CoZ2], [LZel], [Lon5], and [Lon13]. For 
Lagrangian systems on R n , it was proved in [Vitl] by C. Viterbo that the Morse index 
of the corresponding functional coincides with our index theory for symplectic paths 
(cf. Theorem 7.3.1 below by a proof of T. An and the author in [LoAl]). Via such 
theorems, our index theory forms a natural basis of the Morse theoretical study on 
general nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. 
Suppose c is a closed geodesic on a compact Riemannian manifold (M, g). Denote 
the sequence of Morse indices and nullities of the iterations cm of c by {(i (cm), v(cm»}, 
where cm(t) = c(mt) for any t E R. In his pioneering work [Botl] in 1956, R. Bott 
studied properties of this sequence, and established the now so-called Bott formula

for iterations, i.e., 
i(cm ) = L A(w), 
v(cm ) = L N(w), 
wm=l 
wm=l 
where for a fixed closed geodesic c on (M, g), A and N are the Bott index functions 
for second order differential systems which are defined on the unit circle and take 
non-negative integer values. Since Bott's work, various iteration properties of differ-
ent Morse and Maslov type index theories were studied by [Edw 1] of H. Edwards in 
1964, [Klil] ofW. Klingenberg in 1978, [BTZ1] ofW. Ballmann, G. Thobergsson, and 
W. Ziller in 1982, [Ekel]-[Eke3] of I. Ekeland in 1984-1990, [Vit3] of C. Viterbo 
in 1989, and others. Index iteration theories were established in these works for 
closed geodesics (cf. [Botl], [BTZ1], [Klil]), convex Hamiltonian systems (cf. 
[Ekel]-[Eke3]), and star-shaped Hamiltonian systems under certain non-degeneracy 
conditions (cf. 
[Vit3]). Based upon these iteration theories, many interesting 
results on multiplicity, stability, and other problems of geometrically distinct closed 
geodesics on Riemannian manifolds and closed characteristics of convex Hamiltonian 
systems appeared later. Some unsuccessful attempts appeared earlier than 1990 on 
establishment of a complete iteration theory for the general index of symplectic paths. 
Note also that J. Robbin and D. Salamon in [RoSl] of 1993 extended the definition 
of the index of Conley and Zehnder to the degenerate case too so that a catenation 
iteration property holds. But their extension in the degenerate case is different from 
those of [Lon5], [Lon13], and [VitI] (cf. Corollary 3.1 of [LZul]). 
Similarly, in the study on the minimality of period, multiplicity, and stability of 
geometrically distinct periodic solution orbits of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems, the 
author was led to the study of iteration theory of the above mentioned index theory 
for symplectic paths. For our applications, for a symplectic matrix path y E P,(2n) 
we face two types of problems: 
(1) knowing the end point y(r) of a path y E P,(2n), the initial index (il (y), 
VI (y)), and the iteration time m, we want to find the index il (ym) of the m-th 
iterated path ym; 
(2) knowing the end point y(r) of a path y E P,(2n), the initial index (il (y), 
VI (y)), and the index (il (ym), VI (ym)) ofthe m-th iterated path ym, we want 
to find the iteration time m. 
To solve these problems, the first natural consideration is to generalize Bott formu-
lae to the index theory for general symplectic paths. To the author's knowledge, for 
this purpose, such a hopefully correct study of iteration theory for the index of any 
symplectic path in this full generality started from [DoLl] ofDi Dong and the author 
published in 1997. A Nankai Institute preprint of this paper appeared in 1993. The 
basis of this iteration theory was established in [Lonl6] of 1999, where a generalized 
index function theory (iw(Y), vw(y)) parameterized by w in the unit circle U of the

defined. This Bott-type formula is given in Theorem 9.2.1 of this book, i.e., for any 
r > 0, y E P,(2n), Z E U, and mEN, 
iz(Y, m) = L i",(y), 
(1) 
w"'=z 
Vz(y, m) = L v",(y). 
(2) 
w"'=z 
To further solve the problems (I) and (2), we need to go beyond the Bott-type 
formula (1)-(2). For a given path y it is natural to consider constructing a new path 
'fJ in P,(2n) so that 
(3) 
and that (il ('fJm), VI ('fJm)) is easy enough to compute. This leads to finding a homotopy 
8 : [0, 1] x [0, r] ~ Sp(2n) from y to'fJ in P,(2n) and keeping the end points of 
this homotopy always in a certain suitably chosen subset r of Sp(2n), as shown in 
Figure 1 below, so that (3) always holds. 
The classical way to determine the set r before our study was to set 
r = [y(r)] == {p-Iy(r)P I, P E Sp(2n)}, 
the conjugate set of y(r) in Sp(2n). This means that only symplectic coordinate 
changes are allowed in computations. Simplification of the computation of the index 
is then limited to those paths whose end points are symplectic normal form matrices. 
When the dimension of such normal forms are large, the computations are still rather 
complicated.

The homotopy from y to T/ and the subset r 
In order to simplify the computations as much as possible, we try to find the subset r 
of Sp(2n) as big as possible so that (3) still holds. By the Bott-type formula (1)-(2),

to make (3) always hold it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that all the index 
functions iw(15(s, .» do not change for all s E [0, 1] whenever w is a root of unit and 
an eigenvalue of Y (T). Then by stability properties of Morse indices of symmetric 
matrices (Lemma 6.1.3 in this book) and the fact that roots of unit are dense in U, 
it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that all the nullity functions vw(15(s, T)) do 
not change for all s E [0,1] whenever w is an eigenvalue of yeT) on U. Therefore 
in [LonI6] we let the subset r be the path connected component nO(M) containing 
M = yeT) (cf. Definition 1.8.5 below) of the set 
n(M) = {N E Sp(2n) I a(N) n U = a(M) n U, and 
vA(N) = vA(M) VA E a(M) n U} 
(4) 
and call nO(M) the homotopy component of Min Sp(2n). Clearly for any given 
path Y E P r (2n), nO(Y(T)) is the largest set for end points of any homotopy 8 of 
Y so that (3) holds with T/ replaced by 15(s, .). Note that [yeT)] is a proper subset of 
nO(Y(T)) in general. 
Within nO(Y(T)), we then establish a theorem (Theorem 1.8.10 below) to decom-
pose Y (T) into products of certain special 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 symplectic normal form 
matrices, which we call basic normal forms in Definition 1.8.9. Correspondingly by 
the homotopy invariance and symplectic additivity of the index theory, the computa-
tions in (3) are reduced to those of iterations of paths in Sp(2) or Sp(4) whose end 
points are basic normal form matrices. Then this idea is used to derive an algebraic 
characterization of the topologically defined splitting numbers for symplectic matri-
ces in [LonI6] and to establish the precise iteration formulae of indices of symplectic 
paths in [LonI8]. Based upon these results, various new iteration inequalities and 
iteration properties of the index theory are established. The work [LonI6] is based 
upon the earlier works [DoLl], [LoDI], and [HaLl] of Di Dong, Jianlong Han, and 
the author on normal forms of symplectic matrices, and [Lonl5] on structures of 
w-subsets of symplectic groups. Motivated by the precise iteration formulae of 
[LonI8], in a recent paper [LZu3] of Chaofeng Zhu and the author, the abstract 
index iteration formula of any symplectic path was established. On the other hand in 
[DoLl] by D. Dong and the author, [LLol] of 1997 and [LL03] of 2000 by Chun-gen 
Liu and the author, and the recent paper [LZu3], various index iteration inequalities 
were established for any symplectic paths. Especially in the recent [LZu3], the first 
result on the common index iteration property of any finite family of symplectic paths 
with positive mean indices, which we call the common index jump theorem, was 
established. All these results form the iteration theory of the index theory for sym-
plectic matrix paths and general Hamiltonian systems without any non-degeneracy 
conditions. Note that our results on the iteration theory unify and generalize the above 
mentioned known results obtained before 1990. 
By applying this index and its iteration theory to studies on the existence, multiplic-
ity, and stability problems of periodic solutions for nonlinear Hamiltonian systems, 
we have obtained many interesting results. I believe that this index and its iteration

Introduction 
theory possess great potential in solving many other related problems, and thus it is 
worthy to write such a book to introduce them to more people. 
Note that in 1965, v.P. Maslov introduced his celebrated index theory for loops in 
Lagrangian Grassmanians (cf. [MaFl D. A solid mathematical foundation for this 
index theory was established by V.I. Arnold in his famous paper [Arnl] of 1967. The 
main differences between our index theory and the Maslov index are threefold: 
(A) The Maslov index is only defined for loops and curves with ends not on the 
singular cycle. But in our case, the index is also defined for paths with end 
points on the singular cycle, and the role played by end points of symplectic 
paths is rather crucial in our applications. 
(B) In the case of the Maslov index, the relation theorem with Morse index is only 
established for Lagrangian systems, a special class of Hamiltonian systems 
under certain non-degeneracy conditions. But in our case, the relation of the 
index theory with Morse index of general Hamiltonian systems without any 
non-degeneracy conditions is established. 
(C) In our case, the iteration theory is completely established. To the author's 
knowledge, such an iteration theory seems to be unknown for the Maslov 
index theory. 
Next a brief introduction is given to the contents of this book. The first four parts of 
the book are devoted to establish and to study our index and its iteration theory. The 
last part is devoted to their applications to periodic solution problems of nonlinear 
Hamiltonian systems. 
Part I contains Chapters 1 and 2. This part studies the algebraic and topological 
aspects of symplectic matrices and groups. 
In Chapter 1, the algebraic properties of symplectic matrices are studied. Here the 
focus is on the eigenvalues, Krein types, and normal forms of symplectic matrices. 
Based upon the study of the perturbations of normal forms, homotopy components 
and basic normal forms of symplectic matrices are introduced. Especially a new 
concept, the ultimate type of w for M is defined for any w E U and M E Sp(2n). 
These concepts are fundamental for the study of our index and its iteration theory. 
In Chapter 2, the topological aspects of the symplectic group and its w subsets are 
studied. Here for any w E U, the w-singular subset Sp(2n)~ of the symplectic group 
Sp(2n) consists of all symplectic matrices which possess w as an eigenvalue, and 
the w-regular subset Sp(2n)~ is its complement in Sp(2n). Here the most important 
topological properties are: Sp(2n) is homeomorphic to a product of U and a simply 
connected topological space; Sp(2n)~ contains precisely two path-connected com-
ponents and is simply connected in Sp(2n); rotation paths are transversal to Sp(2n)~; 
and the regular part of Sp(2n)~ is orientable. These properties form the basis for our 
index function and its iteration theory. 
Part II contains Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3, classical results on canonical 
transformations and generating functions are introduced. Chapter 4 is devoted to the 
variational structure of Hamiltonian systems. Here two of the most popular finite

dimensional approximation methods are introduced, the Galerkin approximation 
method and the saddle point reduction method. More attention is put on the sad-
dle point reduction method which gives precise information about the index theory 
later. This part also makes necessary preparations for our applications in Part v. 
Part III contains Chapters 5 to 7, in which an index function theory for symplectic 
paths is defined and its properties are studied. We call a path y E P,(2n) to be 
w-degenerate if y(r) E Sp(2n)~, or w-nondegenerate otherwise. In Chapter 5, the 
index function theory parametrized by w E U is established for w-nondegenerate sym-
plectic paths by a homotopy classification for them (cf. Definition 5.2.8), and for any 
w-degenerate symplectic path by a perturbation to a special nearby w-nondegenerate 
path which takes the minimal index value in a certain sense (cf. Definition 5.4.2 
and Theorem 6.1.8 below) based on our studies in Part I. For any w E U, this index 
function theory assigns a pair of integers to any yEP, (2n) which is denoted by 
(iw(Y), vw(y» E Z x {O, 1, ... , 2n}. 
More precisely, the nullity is defined by 
vw(y) = dime kerc(y(r) - wI). 
Note that y is w-degenerate if and only if vw(y) > 0. The rotation index iw(y) can 
be viewed as the intersection number of the joint path y * ~ and Sp(2n )~: 
iw(y) = [SPC2n)~ : Y * H 
when y is w-nondegenerate, where the path ~ : [0, r] --+ Sp(2n) is defined by

Vt E [0, r]. 
When y is w-degenerate, we prove in Section 6.1 that iw (y) defined by the perturbation 
method can also be given by 
iw(y) = 
sup inf{iwC.B) I.B E V, .B(r) E Sp(2n):}, 
UEN(y) 
where N(y) is the set of all open neighborhood:; of y in p,(2n). Note that when 
w = I, the index function is precisely that defined by Conley, Zehnder, Viterbo, and 
the author. 
In Chapter 6, the relation between the index of s) mplectic paths and the Morse index 
of the truncated direct variational functional for Hamiltonian systems is established 
via a saddle point reduction method. An axiomatic characterization of the index 
function theory is given together with some further important properties of the index 
theory. This result shows that this index function theory is completely characterized 
by the homotopy invariance, symplectic additivity and its definition on paths in Sp(2) 
uniquely.

Introduction 
In Chapter 7, the relation between the index of symplectic paths and other Morse 
indices is established, including those for the Galerkin approximation method, second 
order Hamiltonian systems, and general Lagrangian systems. 
Part IV, which contains Chapters 8 to 11, is devoted to the study of the index iteration 
theory. This index iteration theory works also for iterations of closed geodesics on 
Riemannian manifolds as proved in Chapter 12. 
Let N denote the set of natural numbers. For any path yEP, (2n) and mEN, 
we define the m-th iteration ym E Pm, (2n) of y by 
ym(t) = y(t - jr)y(r)J, 
for jr :::: t:::: (j + 1)r, j = 0,1, ... , m-1. 
We denote the index and nullity of ym by 
In Chapter 8, the study of the index for iterations of any symplectic paths is carried 
out for paths in Sp(2) via the R 3-cylindrical coordinate representation of Sp(2), 
then for hyperbolic and elliptic paths in Sp(2n). Based on the study of homotopy 
components in Section 1.8, this yields the precise iteration formula (Theorem 8.3.1) 
of the index theory for any symplectic path YEP, (2n) in terms of the basic norm 
form decomposition (cf. Theorem 1.8.10) ofy(r), (i(y, 1), v(y, 1», and the iteration 
time m. 
In Chapter 9, the splitting numbers S!(a» of a symplectic matrix M at a> E U 
are defined topologically by 
S!(a» = lim iwexp(±..j=If)(Y) - iw(y), 
f~O+ 
via any yEP, (2n) satisfying y (r) = M. Then it is proved in Theorem 9.1.7 
that the splitting numbers of M at a> coincide with the algebraically defined ultimate 
type of a> for M in Section 1.8. In this chapter, the Bott-type iteration formulae 
(Theorem 9.2.1) for any symplectic path is also proved. This formula gives 
i(y, m) = L iw(y), 
v(y, m) = L vw(Y), 
"1m EN. 
It yields especially that the mean index of any symplectic path y E P,(2n) defined 
below is always a finite real number: 
1· 
i(y, m) 
R 
i(y, 1) == 
1m -- E

Based upon these studies, the abstract precise iteration formula (Theorem 9.3.1) for 
any symplectic path y : [0, r] -+ Sp(2n) in terms of splitting numbers of y(r), 
i(y, 1), and the iteration time m is established. This theorem of C. Zhu and the 
author [LZu3] yields: for any path y E P,(2n), let M = y(r). Then for any mEN

we have

E (~:) SM(eA8) - (st(1) + C(M)), 
8E(O,2rr) 
(5) 
where C(M) = LO<8<2rr SM(eA8) and E(a) = min{k E Z I k ~ a} for a E R. 
In Chapter 10, based upon results of Chapters 8 and 9, various iteration inequalities 
of the index theory for any symplectic paths are established. For example, for any 
y E P r (2n) and mEN, the following typical iteration inequalities always hold. 
Estimate via mean index (by C. Liu-Y. Long [LLol, LLo3]): 
mi(y, 1) - n :::: iCy, m) :::: mi(y, 1) + n - v(y, m). 
Estimate via initial index (by C. Liu-Y. Long [LL03]): 
m(i(y, 1) + v(y, 1) - n) + n - v(y, 1) :::: iCy, m) 
:::: m(i(y, 1) + n) - n - (v(y, m) - v(y, 1)). 
Successive index estimates (by Y. Long-C. Zhu [LZu3]): 
v(y, m) - e(y;r)) :::: iCy, m + 1) - iCy, m) - iCy, 1) 
e(y(r)) 
:::: v(y, 1) - v(y, m + 1) +

. 
(6) 
(7) 
(8) 
Here we define e(M) to be the total multiplicity of eigenvalues of a symplectic matrix 
M on U and call it the elliptic height of M. 
A consequence of the iteration inequality (7) together with the necessary and suf-
ficient conditions for any equality in (7) to hold for some m is a new proof of the 
following theorem of [DoLl] on controlling the iteration time m via indices: for any 
y E Pr (2n) andm EN, 
j
i(y,m)::::n+l, 
iCy, 1) ~ n, 
v(y, 1) ~ 1,

In Chapter 11, the common index jump theorem of C. Zhu and the author [LZu3] 
as a common property of any given finite family of symplectic paths Yj E Pr/2n) 
with 1 :::: j :::: q is proved. For any y : [0, r] -+ Sp(2n), its moth index jump 9m(Y) 
is defined to be the open interval 
9m(Y) = (i(y, m) + v(y, m) - 1, iCy, m + 2».

Suppose all these paths possess positive mean indices and large enough initial indices:

iCy, 1) ~ n, 
1 :::: j :::: q.

Introduction 
Then there are infinitely many possibilities that these index jumps match together 
nicely and reach their own largest sizes. More precisely, there exist infinitely many 
positive integer tuples (N, m 1, .•. , mq) E Nq+ 1 such that 
q 
o =1= [2N -
Kl, 2N + K2] c n 92mj-l (Yj),

for some positive constants Kl and K2 independent of j given by

l~J~q 
} } 
K2 = 
min i(Yj, 1) - 1. 
l~j~q 
(11) 
In order to prove this theorem, we need to complete two steps: to make each index 
jump to be as big as possible, and to make their largest sizes happen simultaneously 
to guarantee the existence of a non-empty common intersection interval among them 
and the size of this interval to be as large as possible. By the term E (~:) in the abstract 
iteration formula (5), such proofs are reduced to a dynamics problem in a torus. Then 
this problem is solved by properties of closed additive subgroups of tori. 
In Chapter 12, the classical Morse index theory of closed geodesics on Riemannian 
manifolds is briefly reviewed. Then it is proved that the splitting numbers for closed 
geodesics coincides completely with the splitting numbers of Definition 9.1.4 for 
symplectic matrices. This then proves that the iteration theory we have established in 
Chapters 8 to 11 for symplectic matrix paths works completely for the Morse index 
theory of closed geodesics. 
Part V contains Chapters 13 to 15. In this part, three important problems on periodic 
solutions of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems are studied as applications of our index 
and its iteration theory. 
Let T > 0 and suppose x is a non-constant T -periodic solution of the nonlinear 
Hamiltonian system 
x = J H'(x). 
(12) 
Suppose the minimal period of x is r = T / k for some kEN. Denote by Yx the 
fundamental solution of the linearized Hamiltonian system at x: 
y = J H" (x(t»y. 
(13) 
Then Yx E P r (2n), and is called the associated symplectic path of x. Note that 
The iterated index of x is defined by 
(i(x, m), v(x, m» = (i!(Yxl[O,mrj), vl(Yxl[O,mrj», 
\1m E N. 

Introduction 
xxi 
This yields a way to study iterations xm of x for mEN defined by 
jr: :::: t :::: (j + I)r:, j = 0,1, .. . , m - 1. 
In [Rab2] of 1978, P. Rabinowitz posed a conjecture on whether the Hamiltonian 
system possesses periodic solutions with prescribed minimal period when the Hamil-
tonian function satisfies his superquadratic conditions. This conjecture is studied in 
Chapter 13 as an application of the index iteration theory. Note that for a non-constant 
r:-periodic solution x of (12), the condition on the nullity in (9) always holds because 
the system (12) is autonomous. Thus the above estimate (9) in Chapter 10 can be 
rephrased as follows: 
Theorem A For any non-constant r:-periodic solution x of (12), denote its minimal 
period by r: / m for some mEN. Suppose 
i(xl[o,Tj, 1) :::: n + 1, 
n:::: i(xl[O,T/m], 1). 
(14) 
Then m = 1, i.e., r: is the minimal period of x. 
Here the first estimate in (14) holds if x is obtained by minimax or minimization 
methods, and the second estimate in (14) holds if the Hamiltonian function H is convex 
in a certain weak sense along the orbit of x. This result was proved by D. Dong and 
the author in [DoL 1] of 1997. It reveals the intrinsic relationship between the minimal 
period of a periodic solution and its indices, and unifies all the results obtained so far 
on Rabinowitz's conjecture under various convexity conditions. 
In 1984, C. Conley stated a conjecture on whether the Poincare map of any 
I-periodic time dependent Hamiltonian system defined on the standard torus T2n 
always possesses infinitely many periodic points which are produced by contractible 
periodic solutions of the corresponding Hamiltonian system on T2n. A celebrated 
progress on this conjecture was made by D. Salamon and E. Zehnder in [SaZ2] of 
1992 for a large class of symplectic manifolds (cf. Theorem 14.6.1 below). Restricted 
to the standard torus, Conley's conjecture was proved under the condition that every 
contractible solution of the Hamiltonian system has at least one Floquet multiplier 
not equal to 1. This result answers partially this Conley conjecture. So far the Conley 
conjecture is still open and seems far from being completely understood. 
In Chapter 14, we study the Lagrangian system version of this conjecture. The 
main theorem proved in this chapter is the following: 
Theorem B The Poincare map of a Lagrangian system on the standard n-dimensional 
torus Tn always possesses infinitely many periodic points which are produced by 
contractible integer periodic solutions of this system on Tn, provided the Lagrangian 
function satisfies the Legendre condition (Ll) in Chapter 14 and is at least C3. 
This result was proved in [Lon 17] of 2000. Here the above mentioned estimate (6) 
is one of the crucial ingredients in the proof. By this estimate, a global homological 
injection map can be constructed which maps a certain non-trivial local critical group 
to a nontrivial homology class [a] in a global homology group, if the number of 

XXll 
Introduction 
contractible integer periodic solutions of the related Hamiltonian system is finite. 
But on the other hand, by a technique of V. Bangert and W. Klingenberg in [BaKl], 
it is shown that this homology class [a] must be trivial globally. This contradiction 
then yields the conclusion of Theorem B. 
In Chapter 15, closed characteristics on compact strictly convex C2 hypersurfaces in 
R2n are studied. Denote the set of all such hypersurfaces by 1t(2n). Let ~ E 1t(2n). 
For x E ~, let Nr;(x) be the outward normal unit vector at x of~. We consider the 
problem of finding T > 0 and a C 1 curve x : [0, T] -+ R2n such that 
{ x(t) = lNr.(x(t», 
X(T) = x(O). 
x(t) E ~, 
"It E R, 
(15) 
A solution (T, x) of the problem (15) is called a closed characteristic on ~. Two 
closed characteristics (T, x) and (a, y) are geometrically distinct, if x(R) i= y(R). 
We denote by J(~) and j(~) the set of all closed characteristics (T, x) on ~ with T 
being the minimal period of x and the set of all geometrically distinct ones respectively. 
For (T, x) E J(~), we denote by [(T, x)] the set of all elements in J(~) which are 
geometrically the same as (T, x). # A denotes the total number of elements in a set A. 
This problem has been studied for more than 100 years. A long standing conjecture 
on the multiplicity of closed characteristics is whether 
# j(~) 2: n, 
v ~ E 1t(2n). 
In Chapter 15, the following answers to this conjecture are given via a new shape 
invariant Qn(~) defined by (15.4.1) below for any ~ E 1t(2n). This Qn(~) takes 
values in N U {+oo}: 
Theorem C There holds 
# j(~) 2: Qn(~), 
V~ E 1t(2n). 
(16) 
Especially a lower bound of Qn (~) is given by

where [a] = max{k E Z I k :::: a}for any a E R 
Moreover, for a ~ E 1t(2n), if all the closed characteristics on ~ are non-
degenerate, then

or for a ~ E 1t(2n), if ~ is symmetric with respect to the origin, i.e., x E ~ implies

Introduction 
XXlll 
A long standing conjecture on the stability of closed characteristics is whether 
there always exists at least an elliptic closed characteristic on any :E E 'H (2n). Here a 
(T, x) E J (:E) is elliptic if its all Floquet multipliers are on U when (T, x) is viewed 
as a periodic solution of a corresponding Hamiltonian system. The following partial 
results on this conjecture are given in Chapter 15: 
Theorem D For:E E H(2n), suppose 
# j(:E) < +00. 
(20) 
Then there exists at least an elliptic closed characteristic on :E, and there exists at 
least Qn (:E) -1 (2: [~]) geometrically distinct closed characteristics on :E possessing 
irrational mean indices. 
Moreover, suppose 
n 2: 2, 
(21) 
Then there exist at least two elliptic elements in j(:E). 
All the above results in Theorems C and D on the multiplicity and stability of closed 
characteristics were proved by Y. Long-C. Zhu in [LZu3] recently except the result 
(19) when :E is symmetric with respect to the origin, which was proved by C. Liu-
Y. Long-C. Zhu in [LLZl]. More historical remarks on the problem (15) can be found 
in Chapter 15. 
Note that each closed characteristic [(T, x)] on :E corresponds to infinitely many 
critical values in the whole critical value sequence {Ck} of the related dual action 
functional as studied by I. Ekeland in Section Y.3 of [Eke3]. But it is very difficult to 
extract information from such subsequences of {Ck}. In order to count the number of 
closed characteristics on :E, in stead of studying {Ck}, our method is to study how the 
index intervals of iterated closed characteristics cover the set of integers 2N - 2 + n. 
In the proof of the multiplicity claims (16)-(18) of Theorem C, this method is realized 
via the following most important ingredients, the common index jump theorem (11) 
and the following observations: 
# j(:E) 
> 
q 
> 
#((2N -2+n)nn)=I Q2m j-l(Yxj) 
> 
# ((2N - 2 + n) n [2N -
Kl, 2N + K2]) 
(22) 
> 
Qn(:E), 
where q is the number of infinitely variationally visible closed characteristics 
on :E given by Definition 15.3.3. Our proof of the second inequality in (22) 
uses the Lyusternik-Schnirelman theoretical argument, i.e., the Fadell-Rabinowitz 
SI-cohomology index theory, and those of the last two inequalities in (22) use the 
Morse theoretical approach. Here the common index jump theorem picks up enough 
points of 2N - 2 + n in the interval 
[2N -
Kl, 2N + K2] c n)=I Q2m j-l(YXj)' 

xxiv 
Introduction 
and this number yields a lower bound for # j("b). Because the invariant Qn("b) is 
defined via the initial indices and splitting numbers of closed characteristics on "b, our 
previous studies on the index theory produce the estimates (16)-(18) on the number 
#j("b). 
The estimate (19) on # j("b) for any symmetric hypersurface "b in 1{(2n) depends 
on the common index jump theorem and two separate lower bound estimates on the 
numbers of two different families of closed characteristics. One family contains the 
symmetric orbits, i.e., those [(T, x)]'s which satisfy x(R) = -x(R). The other one 
contains asymmetric orbits, i.e., those [(T, x)]'s which satisfy x(R) n -x(R) = 0. 
The sum of the two lower bound estimates is at least n. 
The proofs for the stability results depend further on an enhanced version of the 
iteration estimate (8) on the elliptic height. This result relies also on the common index 
jump theorem which yields precise iterated index information about the solutions 
found by variational methods. 
At the end of Chapter 15, a result in [DDEl] of G.F. Dell' Antonio, B. D'Onofrio, 
and I. Ekeland proved in 1992 is also introduced, which shows that there is always an 
elliptic closed characteristic on any "b E 1{(2n) provided it is symmetric with respect

reasonable size, and results in less of an overlap with other books. 
In each section of this book, theorems, definitions, propositions et al are numbered 
together sequentially. Within the same section they are refereed to by this number. 
If it is in another section, or another chapter, the corresponding section number as 
well as the chapter number are also recalled. For example, Theorem 1 means the first 
theorem in the same section. Theorem 2.1 means Theorem 1 in Section 2 of the same 
chapter, and Theorem 3.2.1 means Theorem 1 in Section 2 of Chapter 3. Equations 
are numbered in a similar way. Note that equations in this Introduction are numbered 
as in Section 0 of Chapter 0 in the text below. For example, equation (16) in this 
Introduction is denoted by equation (0.0.16) when it is quoted in the text of this book. 
At the end of each section and the Notes and Comments of the last three chap-
ters, historical remarks and further comments on results mentioned in the text are 
made. These remarks may not be complete, because of the limitation of the author's

Part I 
The Symplectic Group Sp(2n) 

Chapter 1 
Algebraic aspects 
In the first three sections of this chapter, we study linear symplectic algebra, especially 
the algebraic properties of symplectic matrices, their eigenvalues and the Krein type 
of eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex plane. In Sections 4 to 7, we derive 
normal forms of symplectic matrices according to their eigenvalues. In Sections 8 
and 9, we introduce the homotopy component, basic normal forms, and the ultimate 
type of symplectic matrices, and study their basic properties. 
Systematic studies of symplectic matrices, symplectic groups, and linear Hamil-
tonian systems were done by M. Krein, I. Gelfand, V. Lidskii, and J. Moser in the 
1950s independently for the stability problem. These works are summarized in the 
book [YaSl] of V. Yakubovich and V. Starzhinski. 
The basic properties of symplectic matrices described in Sections 1 and 3 can be 
found in the pioneering works [GeLl] of I. Gelfand and V. Lidskii and [Mosl] of 
J. Moser, and the books [Eke3] of I. Ekeland, [MoZl] of J. Moser and E. Zehnder, 
[Weyl] of H. WeyJ, and [YaSl] of V. Yakubovich and V. Starzhinski. Studies of the 
Krein type of eigenvalues of symplectic matrices on U in Section 3 are taken from 
[YaS 1] and [Eke3] respectively. Here I restrict myself to only what is needed for our 
later usage in this book. For other properties of the Krein type numbers we refer to 
the books [YaSI] and [Eke3]. 
1.1 
Symplectic matrices 
In this section, we shall define the symplectic matrix, and study its basic algebraic 
properties. In this book, we denote by N, Z, R, and C the sets of all natural, integral, 
real and complex numbers respectively. By U we denote the unit circle in the complex 
plane C. For a given matrix M with entries in R or C, we denote the transpose of M 
by MT, and the complex conjugate of MT by M*. For any n E N and any field K, 
denote by K n the linear product vector space formed by all the column vectors of the 
form x = (Xl, ... , xn)T with Xi E K. Let £(Kn) be the group of all n x n matrices 
with entries in the field K under the usual matrix multiplication. In this book, we 
are only interested in two cases of the real number field K = R and the complex 
number field K = C. Identifying with the n2-dimensional topological product space 
2 
Kn ,the group £(Kn) becomes a topological group. Any of its subgroups, equipped 
with the induced topology, also becomes a topological group. Denote by £sCKn) the 
symmetric matrix subgroup of £(Kn). As usual, the orthogonal group G(n, R) is the 
subgroup of £(Rn) formed by those elements M satisfying M MT = I. The unitary 
group U(n, C) is the subgroup of £(Cn ) formed by those elements M satisfying 
MM* = I.

Definition 1 A matrix M E C(R2n ) is a symplectic matrix, if 
MTJM=J, 
(1) 
where J = (~ ~n) is called the standard symplectic matrix on R2n. In E 
C(Rn) is the identity matrix. When there is no confusion we shall omit the subindex 
n. We denote the zero matrix by o. All the 2n x 2n symplectic matrices form a 
subgroup of C(R2n ), which we denote by Sp(2n, R) and call it the symplectic group. 
When there is no confusion, we simply denote it by Sp(2n) in this book. 
Denote the inner product in R 2n by a . b. Then a matrix M E C(R 2n) is symplectic, 
if and only if 
JMa·Mb=Ja·b, 
From the definition, every symplectic matrix satisfies (det M)2 = 1. Especially, all 
the symplectic matrices are non-singular. Later det M = 1 will be further proved. 
Consider a 2 x 2 real matrix 
By Definition 1, the matrix M is symplectic if and only if ad - bc = 1. This result 
has the following generalization. 
Lemma 2 Suppose a 2n x 2n matrix M has the square blockform 
10 The matrix M is symplectic if and only if both ATe and B T D are symmetric, 
and AT D - CT B = I. 
20 Especially when C = 0, the matrix M is symplectic if and only if A is non-
singular, and M can be represented in the form 
where E is a symmetric matrix. 
Proof: 10 follows from the definition. From lOwe get AT D = I. Let E = A-I B 
from which we obtain 2° . 
0 
Similar to the polar decomposition of complex numbers, symplectic matrices have 
also their polar decompositions. The following lemma yields this result. 

1.1 
Symplectic matrices 
5 
Lemma 3 Any symplectic matrix M E Sp(2n) can be represented in the form 
M=AU, 
(2) 
where A is a symmetric symplectic positive definite matrix, U is a symplectic ortho-
gonal matrix, and they are uniquely determined by M. 
Proof: Let A = -J M MT. Then A is symmetric and non-negative definite. Since 
M is non-singular, A is positive definite. Let U = A-I M. Then (2) holds, and from 
we obtain that U is orthogonal. 
If M possesses two polar decompositions M = AIUl = A2U2, then Ui AJ 
Ui A2. Thus 
Ai = Al UJ ui AJ = A2u2ui A2 = A~, 
and then AJ = A2. This implies Ul = U2 and proves the uniqueness of the decom-
position (2). 
By the definition of a symplectic matrix, M = J-1(MT)-IJ. Thus by (2), we 
obtain 
By the uniqueness of the decomposition (2) just proved we obtain A = J- 1 A-I J 
and U = J- 1(U T )-1 J. Thus both A and U are symplectic. 
0 
It is well known that every positive definite symmetric matrix P can be uniquely 
represented by 
P = exp(M), 
where M is a real symmetric matrix, and 
1 
2 
1 
3 
exp(M)=I+M+ 21 M +31 M + ... , 
M is called the logarithm matrix of P. Especially the following result holds for 
symplectic matrices. 
Lemma 4 A positive definite symmetric matrix P E £(R2n) is symplectic, if and 
only if it has the form 
P = exp(M), 
where M = (~ !!A ), A and B are symmetric n x n matrices. 

6 
1 Algebraic aspects 
Proof: Necessity. Since exp(M) = P is symplectic, 
exp(M) = J-1(exp(M»-1 J = exp( _J-1 M J). 
Since -J- 1 M J is real symmetric, by the uniqueness ofthe above representation we 
obtain 
(3) 
Setting M = (~ ~) in (3) yields D = -A and B = C. On the other hand, by 
the symmetry of M, we obtain BT = CT = B and AT = A. The necessity is proved. 
Sufficiency. P = exp(M), M = (~ !A) together with the symmetries of A 
and B imply (3) and the symmetry of M. Thus P is symplectic. 
0 
Lemma 5 lOAn orthogonal matrix U is symplectic, if and only if it has the form 
U _ (A 
-
B -B) 
A 
' 
(4) 
where AT B is symmetric, and AT A + BT B = 1. 
20 These conditions are also the necessary and sufficient conditions such that 
A - R 
B and A + R 
B are unitary matrices. 
Proof: 10 Sufficiency. This follows by direct computations. 
Necessity. By the given conditions it holds that UT KU = K, where K = 1 or J. 
Thus it also holds for K = I + R 
J . Let 
U=(~ ~). 
Comparing both sides we obtain 
E*E = F*F = I, 
E*F = HI, 
(5) 
where E = A + Rc, F = B + RD, E* denotes the complex conjugate of 
E T. This implies 
E*(E + HF) = O. 
By (5) we obtain that E* is non-singular. Thus E + R 
F = O. This proves D = A 
and B = -c. 
The symmetry of AT B and A T A + B T B = I follow from the orthogonality of U 
immediately. 
The proof of 20 is similar, and is left to the readers.

1.2 Symplectic spaces 
The above lemma establishes actually an isomorphism between groups 
Sp(2n, R) n O(2n, R) ~ U(n, C). 
Note that in the sense of the topological groups, this is also a homeomorphism. 
Define the 2n x 2n complex matrix 
T = (II HI) 
-HI' 
Then the matrix U in Lemma 5 is transformed to 
TUT-1 = (A + Ho-IB 
0 
) 
A-HB' 
Lemma 6 For any symplectic matrix M, 
detM = 1. 
7 
(6) 
(7) 
Proof: By Lemma 3, the matrix M has its polar decomposition M = P U, where P 
is symplectic symmetric positive definite and U is symplectic orthogonal. Then 
det M = det P det U. 
By (6) we obtain 
det U = det(TUT-1) = det[(A + HB)(A + HB)*] = 1, 
where A* = A, B* = B, and A + HB are unitary. Since P is symplectic, 
(det p)2 = 1. But P is positive definite, then det P = 1. Therefore (7) holds. 
0 
Our above proof shows that the determinant of every symplectic matrix is 1. More 
importantly we shall see in Chapter 2 that following this discussion the global topo-
logical structure of the symplectic group can be obtained. 
1.2 Symplectic spaces 
In this section we briefly introduce the theory of symplectic spaces. 
Definition 1 Suppose V is a real vector space of dimension m, and w is an antisym-
metric nondegenerate bilinear form defined on V, i.e., w satisfies 
w(u, v) 
w(u, v) 
-w(v, u), 
Vu, v E V, 
o for some u E V and any v E V 
implies 
u = O. 
(1) 
(2) 
Then w is called a symplectic form defined on V, and (V, w) is a symplectic space. 

8 
1 Algebraic aspects 
Let (V, w) be a symplectic space. u, v E V are symplectically orthogonal and 
denoted by u .l v, if w(u, v) = 0. For A, B e V, we define A .l B if u .l v for all 
u E A and v E B. By the skew-symmetry of w, it holds that v .l v for every v E V. 
Let E be a linear subspace of V. Define 
E.1. = {u E V I w(u, v) = 0, Vv E E}. 
(3) 
Then E.1. is a linear subspace of V, and 
By the non-degeneracy of w, 
dim E + dim E.1. = dim V. 
(4) 
Definition 2 A linear subspace E ofthe symplectic space (V, w) is 
isotropic, 
if 
E eE.1., 
coisotropic, 
if 
E.1. eE, 
Lagrangian, 
if E=E.1., 
symplectic, 
if En E.1. = {OJ. 
If E is a subspace of (V, w), then the restriction of won E is still a symplectic form 
if and only if En E.1. = {OJ. This is the reason why such an E is called a symplectic 
subspace of (V, w). Clearly, every I-dimensional subspace of (V, w) is isotropic. 
Lemma 3 Let (V, w) be a symplectic space. Then it must be even dimensional. 
Denote its dimension by 2n. Then there exists a base {VI, ... , V2n} such that 
(5) 
W(Vi, Vj) = 0, 
otherwise. 
(6) 
The base satisfying these conditions is called a symplectic base of (V, w). 
Proof: Fix a non-zero vector VI E V. By the non-degeneracy of w, there exists a 
vector Vn+l E V such that W(VI, Vn+l) = 1. Thus VI and Vn+l are linearly indepen-
dent. If m == dim V .:s 2, the lemma is proved. If m > 2, let E = span{vI, vn+d. 
Then both of E and E.1. are symplectic subspaces of (V, w). Since dim E.1. = m - 2 
> 0, by an induction argument on the dimension the proof is complete. 
0 
The most popular example is the so-called standard symplectic space (R 2n, w) 
with w defined by the standard symplectic matrix J introduced in Section 1.1: 
w(u, v) = Ju . v,

Here W is the standard symplectic form on R2n. In terms of the notation in the 
exterior algebra, if we introduce the coordinates (PI, ... , Pn, ql, ... , qn) on R 2n , 
the symplectic form W can be represented by 
n 
W = dp 1\ dq = Ldpi 1\ dqi. 
i=1 
Let {VI, ... , V2n} be a symplectic base of (R2n, w). For any x and y E R 2n , let

for 
1::::: i ::::: n,

vT lVj = lVj . Vi = -W(Vi, Vj) = 0, 
otherwise. 
(10) 
Corollary 4 Let (VI, WI) and (V2, W2) be two symplectic spaces with the same 
dimension 2n. Then there exists an invertible linear map T : VI -+ V2 such that 
w2(Tu, Tv) = Wl(U, v), 
Vu , v E VI. 
(11) 
Proof: For i = 1 and 2, let (v~, ... , v~n) be a symplectic base of (Vi, Wi). Define 
Vk = 1, ... , 2n. 
Then extending T linearly to the whole VI completes the proof. 
o 
In the sense of this corollary, all the symplectic spaces of the same dimension are 
equivalent. Therefore the study on the general symplectic spaces can be reduced to 
that on (R 2n , w) with no loss of generality. 
1.3 Eigenvalues of symplectic matrices 
Denote by U = {z E C Ilzl = 1} the unit circle on the complex plane C. For any 
n x n matrix (real or complex), as usual we denote by u(M) the spectrum of M, i.e., 
the set of all A E C such that 
det(M - U) = 0.

Suppose Je E a(M). The geometric multiplicity of Je E a(M) is defined to be 
dime kerc(M - U). Note that when M is real and Je E R, 
Denote the complex root vector space of M belonging to Je by 
(1) 
The algebraic multiplicity of Je E a(M) is defined to be dime E)...(M). 
Fix any M E Sp(2n). In order to determine eigenvalues of M, for Je E C we 
consider its characteristic polynomial 
fM(Je) = det(M - AI). 
(2) 
This is a polynomial of degree 2n in Je with real coefficients. Since M is symplectic, 
we have 
Thus 
Therefore fM(A) can be written in the symmetric form 
n 
fM(Je) = An L adAk + A-k), 
k=O 
(3) 
(4) 
where an = 1, ak = Zh, k = 0, 1, ... , n, ak denotes the complex conjugate of ak. 
From these derivations we obtain 
Theorem 1 1° If A E a(M) and ImA . (IAI2 - 1) =1= 0, then A, I, A-I, and (I)-1 
belong to a (M), and possess the same geometric and algebraic multiplicities. 
2° 1f A E a(M) and A E R \ {±1}, then A, A-I E a(M), and possess the same 
geometric and algebraic multiplicities. 
3° 1fA E a(M) and IAI = 1, A2 =1= 1, then A, IE a(M) and possess the same 
geometric and algebraic multiplicities. 
4 ° 1f + 1 or -1 E a (M), then its algebraic multiplicity is even. 
Proof: 1° to 3° follow from (3) and (4). We prove 4° next. From 1 °_3° we obtain 
that the total algebraic multiplicity of all eigenvalues in a (M) not equal to ± 1 is an 
even integer, say 2k. Thus the total algebraic multiplicity of + 1 and -1 is 2(n - k). 
Since det M = 1, the algebraic multiplicity of -1 and then that of + 1 must be

Following M. Krein, we define 
(5) 
Denote the inner product in Ck for any kEN by (., .). With the aid of the matrix G, 
the Krein form is defined by 
(Gx, y) 
(6) 
Recall that a subspace E C C 2n is an invariant subspace of M if ME C E. Then 
the above E-;..(M) is invariant under M. An invariant subspace E is irreducible, if 
it is not a direct sum of two non-trivial invariant subspaces. Then any irreducible 
invariant subspace is contained in some EJ...(M) and every EJ...(M) is a direct sum of 
irreducible invariant subspaces. An eigenvalue A of M is called semi-simple, if each 
irreducible invariant subspace of EJ...(M) is one dimensional, i.e., all the elementary 
divisors belonging to A of the characteristic polynomial of M are simple. 
Lemma 2 For M E Sp(2n), suppose A and /L E a(M), and AM -I 1. Then EJ...(M) 
and EJL(M) are G-orthogonal. 
Proof: Let u E E J... (M) and vEE JL (M). By definition there exist k and hEN such 
that (M - H)ku = 0 and (M - /Ll)hv = O. We continue the proof by induction on 
k+h. 
If k + h = 2, then k = h = 1 and Mu = AU and Mv = /LV. Thus, 
((AM - l)Gu, v) = (~JMu, Mv) -
(~Ju, v) = o. 
Thus Lemma 2 holds in this case. 
Let m 
~ 3, and suppose the lemma holds for any k and hEN such that 
k + h < m. Let u = (M - Al)u and v = (M - /L1)v. Then (M - H)k-l u = 0 and 

12 
1 Algebraic aspects 
(M - /Ll)h-I v = O. Thus by the induction assumption, (Gu, v) = 0, (Gu, v) = 0, 
and (Gu, v) = O. They yield 
(GMu, v) 
(GMu, Mv) 
A(GU, v) = 0, 
(Gu, Mv) - lI(Gu, v) = 0, 
A(GU, Mv) - Ji,(GMu, v) + A7I(GU, v) = o. 
Plugging the first two into the third, we obtain 
(1 - A7I)(GU, v) = o. 
By the fact All i= 1 we obtain the lemma. 
Corollary 3 For M E Sp(2n), if A E a (M) \ U, then E;.,.(M) is G-isotropic, i.e., 
(Gx, y) = 0 
'V x, Y E EJ...(M). 
o 
By Lemma 2, the complex space C 2n possesses a G-orthogonal decomposition 
c 2n = (EhEa(M)nuEJ...(M)) EEl F(M), 
where F(M) is the direct sum of those EJ...(M)s with A E a(M)\ U. 
(7) 
Corollary 4 For ME Sp(2n), if A E a(M)nU, then the restrictionofG to EJ...(M) is 
non-degenerate, i.e.,for x E EJ...(M), (Gx, y) = 0 for all y E EJ...(M) implies x = O. 
Proof: By Lemma 2 and (7), such an x must belong to the kernel of G on C 2n . Thus 
x = 0 by the non-degeneracy of G on C 2n . 
0 
Corollary 5 For ME Sp(2n), if A E a(M) n U is not semi-simple, then there exists 
an eigenvector x belonging to A of M which is G-isotropic, i.e., (Gx, x) = O. 
Proof: Since A is not semi-simple, using one Jordan block belonging to A of M, we 
obtain an eigenvector x and a root vector yin EJ...(M) such that My = AY + x. Thus 
(Gx, y) = (GMx, My) = (AGX , AY + x) = IAI2(Gx, y) + A(GX, x). 
Thus (Gx, x) = O. 
o 
Definition 6 Given M E Sp(2n), suppose A E a(M) n U. By Corollary 4, the 
restriction GIEA(M) of G to EJ...(M) is non-degenerate. Denote the total multiplicities 
of positive and negative eigenvalues of G lEA (M) by p and q respectively. The integer 
pair (p, q) is called the Krein type number of A E a(M). If q = 0, A is Krein-
positive. If p = 0, A is Krein-negative. If both p and q are positive, A is of mixed 
kind. 
Note that by direct computation, eRe and e-Re are eigenvalues of the matrix

Lemma 7 For any M and P E Sp(2n), suppose A E o-(M) n u. Then the algebraic 
and geometric multiplicities and the Krein-type number of A as an eigenvalue of 
p- I M P are the same as those of M. 
Proof: By direct computations. 
o 
Lemma 8 For M E Sp(2n), if A E o-(M) n U has Krein type (p, q), then X has 
Krein type (q, p). Specially, if 1 or -1 E 0- (M), it must have Krein type (p , p) for 
some pEN. 
Proof: Note that for any x E C 2n , the real part of (J x, x) is zero. Thus 
(Gx, x) = H(Jx, x) = -(Gx, x). 
(8) 
We continue our study in two cases. 
Case 1 A E o-(M) n (U\R). Let {Xl, ... , Xk} be a G-orthogonal base of E),.(M). 
Then {Xl, ... , xd form a G-orthogonal base of EIJM). Then from (8) the lemma 
follows in this case. 
Case 2 A = ±1. Then the corresponding E),.(M) is 2d-dimensional for some dEN 
and real. Denote the Krein type belonging to the eigenvalue A of M by (p, q) with 
p + q = 2d. Then the same argument as in Case 1 shows that p = q. 
0 
Theorem 9 For M E Sp(2n), suppose (J) E o-(M) n U is a p-fold Krein definite 
eigenvalue. Then 
10 
(J) must be semi-simple, 
20 there exists E > 0 and 8 > 0 such that any N E Sp(2n) satisfying liN - M II :s 8, 
any eigenvalue A of N satisfying IA - {J)I :s E must locate on U, and be semi-
simple and of the same Krein sign. 
Proof: By the hypothesis, we have (J) E U\R. 
10 Since (J) is Krein definite, by Corollary 5, it must be semi-simple. 
2° Without loss of generality, we suppose (J) has Krein-type number (p, 0). If the 
claim does not hold, there exists a sequence of matrices Mi and eigenvalues 
Ai E o-(Mi) such that Mi -+ M, Ai -+ (J), and one of the following three 
cases happens: IAi I f= 1, Ai is not semi-simple, or Ai is Krein negative. By 
Corollaries 3 and 5, there exists Xi E E),.; (M) such that (GXi, Xi) :s 0 and 
Ix;! = 1. By passing to a subsequence of {Xi}, we can assume Xi -+ x. This 
yields Mx = {J)X, Ixi = 1, and (Gx , x) :s O. This contradicts the Krein positive 
definiteness of (J) as an eigenvalue of M.

It is well known that a(U) C U for any unitary matrix U E .C(Cn ). The following 
result on the spectrum of symplectic orthogonal matrices is based on the study of 
D. Salamon and E. Zehnder in the third paragraph on p.1316 of [SaZ2]. 
Theorem lOSupposeM E Sp(2n)nO(2n)withM = (~ -:) as in Lemma 1.5. 
Then 
a(M) = a(A - .J=lB) U a(A + .J=lB) c U.

Moreover, A E a(M) possesses Krein type (p, q) if and only if I E a(M) possesses 
Krein type (q, p), if and only if A and I E a (A - R 
B) possess multiplicities p 
and q respectively, if and only if A and I E a (A + R B) possess multiplicities q 
and p respectively. 
Proof: We denote for short by (u, v) the vector (uT , vT)T in the following. Fix 
such an M. By an induction argument, for any ~ E Cn and kEN we obtain 
(M - Ul( -.J=l~,~) 
= (-.J=l(A -.J=lB -
Al)k~, (A -.J=lB -
Al)k~) 
(10) 
(M -
Il)k(.J=l~,~) 
= (.J=l(A +.J=lB -
Il)k~, (A +.J=lB -
Il)k~). 
(11) 
This especially proves (9). 
By direct computation, we obtain 
Note that the Krein form G = R 
I is positive definite on Q+ and negative definite 
on Q_. Note also C 2n = Q+ E9 Q_. From 1M = MI, we obtain MQ± C Q±. 
This implies M Q± = Q±. 
For A E a(M) let E)...(M) be the root vector space of Min C 2n belonging to the 
eigenvalue A. Let (u, v) E E)...(M) C C 2n , and

1.4 Normal forms for the eigenvalue 1 
The results in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the normal forms of symplectic matrices are 
based upon recent works [LoDl] and [HaLl] by D. Dong, J. Han, and the author, 
which were proved in order to establish our index iteration theory, and were done 
when we were not aware of earlier existing related results. For other different types 
of normal forms for symplectic matrices and linear Hamiltonian systems we refer 
to works of 1. Williamson [Will] in 1937, N. Burgoyne and R. Cushman [BuCl] 
in 1973, A. Laub and K. Meyer [LaMl] in 1974, H. Wimmer [Wiml] in 1991, and 
L. Hormander [Hom2] in 1995. But results contained in these works are developed 
for different purposes and may not be convenient for our study on the topology of 
symplectic groups and the index theory for Hamiltonian systems.

It is easy to verify that the multiplication defined by 0 among even order square block 
form matrices is associative. We denote by M ok the k-fold o-product Mo··· oM. 
Note that the o-product of two symplectic matrices is still symplectic. The o-product 
is introduced according to the form of the standard symplectic matrix J chosen in 
Definition 1.1.

Here Mo E Sp(2ko) with ko ~ 0 and 1 ¢ u (Mo). For 1 :s i :s m, each Mi E Sp(2ki) 
with ki ~ 1. Let EI (M) denote the invariant root vector space of M belonging to 
the eigenvalue 1. Then 2 L:r=o ki = 2ko + dim EI (M) = 2n, Mi = Nkj (1, b) with

Lemma 3 Suppose M E Sp(2n) possesses root vectors {~i, 1lj 11 :::: i :::: p, 1 ::::

belonging to the eigenvalue 1 such that, setting ~o = 1'/0 = 0, (9) holds and 
M 1'/ j = 1'/ j + 1'/ j -1 , fOT 1 :::: j :::: q.

Proof: Computing ~r J 1'/j via (9) and (12) yields the conclusion.

In order to study the normal forms of symplectic matrices with the eigenvalue 1, 
we consider the following three basic cases. 
Case 1 The matrix M possesses a Jordan block belonging to the eigenvalue 1, which 
is given by root vectors {~i 11 :::: i :::: p} satisfying (9) such that 
(15) 
Note that (15) implies p > 1. If p = 2k + 1 for some kEN, by (11) we obtain 
~[ J~k+l = 0. By (10) and an induction argument this implies ~r n p = 0, a con-
tradiction. Thus we must have p = 2k for some kEN. Let F = span{~l, ... , ~2k} 
and G = span{~I, ... , ~k}. 
Note that G is an isotropic subspace of R2n by (11), i.e., 
for 1:::: i, j :::: k. 
(16) 
By (15), if necessary multiplying all ~iS by 1/ I-~r J ~2k 11/2, without loss of generality, 
we may assume ~ r 
J ~2k = -1. 
Subcase 1.1 k = 1. 
Let 81 = ~1 and 82 = ~2. They form a symplectic base for F, and 
(17) 
where MI = Nl(1, 1) E Sp(2) is defined by (1). In this book, for any given 
matrices AI, ... , Am, each of which possesses the same number of rows, we denote 
by (AI, ... , Am) the matrix formed by their column vectors. Here (81,82) is the 
2n x 2 matrix formed by 81 and d12. We can extend {81, 82} to a matrix!'!. E Sp(2n) 
such that 81 and 82 form the I-st and the (n + 1)-st columns of !'!. and for some 
Mo E Sp(2(n - k)), 
(18)

Subcase 1.2 k > 1. 
By (10) and (11) for this subcase we obtain

for 1 ::s i ::s k.

By (9), 
if 1::s i ::s k, 
(20) 
if k + 1 ::s i ::s 2k. 
(21) 
Here and below in this chapter by com{ VI, ... , V j} we denote some R-linear combi-
nation of the vectors {VI, ... , V j }. 
In the following we continue our study based on (11), (19), (20), and (21) only. 
Define 00 = 0 and 
0i = ~i,

~2k+I-i + L ak+i,h~2k+I-h

h=i+1 
(23) 
By (19), the constants ak+i,j are uniquely determined. 
Fix i E [1, k]. We obtain 0~f8k+i = 0 for 1 ::s m ::s i-I by (11), and for 
i + 1 ::s m ::s k by (11) and (23). Thus 
for 1 ::s i ::s k. 
(24) 
Note that by (11) and (19), 
for 1::s i ::s k. 
(25) 
By (22) we also have 
M8k+i = 8k+i + com{8k+i+I, ... , 82k}, 
for 1 ::s i ::s k. 
Next we further modify the 8i s to get a symplectic base of F. We define 
for 
i = k + 1, ... , 2k -
1. 
(26) 

1.4 Normalforms for the eigenvalue 1 
21 
Now for k + 1 :s i :s 2k - 1, by (11), (24), and (25), we get 
Or_kJOi = -1, 
Oi -1 {01,.··, Oi-k-l, Oi-k+l, ... , od· 
Especially by (11), (24), and (26), we obtain or J OJ = 0 for k + 1 :s i < j :s 2k. 
Then from all the above results we obtain F = span {Oi 11 :s i :s 2k} and 
or JOk+i = -1, 
for 
I:s i :s k, 
(27) 
or JOj = 0, 
for 
1:s i , j :s 2k and Ii - jl f=- k, 
(28) 
for 1:s i :s k, 
MOi = Oi + com{Oi-k. ... , Ok. Oi+l,"" 02k}, 
for k + 1 :s i :s 2k. 
(29) 
(30) 
Therefore by (27) and (28), the vectors {Ol, ... , 02k} form a symplectic base of F, 
and we have 
(31) 
where MI is of the form 
with k x k matrices A, B, and C. By (29) and (30) the matrix A = Ak(1) is of the 
form (3), Band C are lower triangular matrices and the diagonal elements of Care 
all 1. Because M E Sp(2n) and {01 , ... , 02k} form a symplectic base, (3) implies 
MJ E Sp(2k). Therefore, ATC = I and BTC = CT B. TheseimplythatC = Ck(1) 
is of the form (4), and that B = Bk(1, b) is of the form (5) for some bE Rk. 
Note that in this case, bk f=- 0 in (5). Thus (7) holds in this case. 
Now by (27) and (28) we can extend {01, ... , 02d to a matrix /)" E Sp(2n) such 
that {01, . . . , Ok} form the I-stto k-th columns and {Ok+ 1, . . . , 02k} form the (n + 1)-st 
to (n + k)-th columns of /)", and for some Mo E Sp(2(n - k)), 
(32) 
Case 2 The matrix M possesses a Jordan block for the eigenvalue 1, which is given 
by root vectors {~d 1 :s i :s p} satisfying (7) such that 
~r J~p > O. 
(33)

Algebraic aspects 
From (33) as in the study of the case 1, p > 1 and p is even. Suppose p = 2k for 
some kEN. Define 
T/i = ~i, 
T/i = 
-~i, 
for 0 ~ i ~ k, 
for k + 1 ~ i ~ 2k. 
Then T/ r J T/2k < O. Without loss of generality, we can assume T/ r J T/2k = -1. 
Subcase 2.1 k = 1. 
Let 01 = T/I and 02 = T/2. They form a symplectic base of F, and (17) holds, 
where MI = NI(l, -1) E Sp(2) is defined by (1). As in the Subcase 1.1, we can 
also extend {Ol, 02} to a matrix ~ E Sp(2n) to get the corresponding (18). 
Subcase 2.2 k > 1. 
Then by (9), (10), and (11) for the ~iS we obtain (11), (19), (20), and (21) for the 
T/iS. Now we can carry out the proof of Case 1 to obtain a new symplectic base of 
F = span{T/I, .. . , 7J2d such that (31) and (32) hold. 
Note that in this case, bk f= 0 in (5). Thus (7) holds in this case. 
Case 3 The matrix M possesses two equal size Jordan blocks belonging to the 
eigenvalue 1, which are given by root vectors {~i, T/ j 11 ~ i, j ~ k} satisfying (9) and 
(12) with p = q = k such that 
(34) 
If necessary multiplying all T/j by -I/(~r JT/k), without loss of generality, we 
suppose ~r JT/k = -1. Denote F = span{~i, T/jlI ~ i, j ~ k}. 
Subcase 3.1 k = 1. 
Let 01 = ~ I and 02 = T/ I. They form a symplectic base of F, and (17) holds, where 
MI = NI(l, 0) = h E Sp(2). We can also extend {Ol, 02} to a matrix ~ E Sp(2n) 
to get the corresponding (18). 
Subcase 3.2 k > 1. 
By ~r J T/k = -1 and (13) we obtain 
T 
i 
~i JT/k-i+1 = (-1) , 
VI ~ i ~ k. 
(35) 
We first prove the following lemma. 
Lemma 4 Without loss of generality, we can further assume that 
VI ~ i, j ~ k. 
(36) 
Proof: Assume (36) does not hold. Together with (34) we must have k > 2. Let 
m = m ({ ~d l:Si:sd be the least integer in [1, k] such that there exists the least integer 
q E [m + 1, k] satisfying~;;: J~q f= O. By (11) and (34) we must have 1 < m < k. 

1.4 Normalforms for the eigenvalue 1 
23 
If q < k, by (11) we obtain 
~~-1 l~q + ~~-l l~q+l + ~~ nq = O. 
By the minimality of m this yields ~;;: I ~q = 0, a contradiction. Thus we must have 
q = k. 
If k - m = 2p for some pEN, using (10) inductively we obtain 
o = ~~+pl~m+p = ~~+pl~k-P = ±~~ Ih =f. O. 
This contradiction shows that k - m must be odd. 
Thus by (35) we obtain 
~~lTJk-m+l + TJi l~k = 2(-I)m. 
(37) 
Let a = (_l)m+l~;;: nk/2. Define 00 = 0 and 
0; = 
~;, 
if 1:s i < m, 
0; = 
~; +aTJj-m+l, 
if m:S i:s k. 
Replacing ~i by 0; we obtain that the corresponding relations (9) and (12) still hold, 
and that F = span{o;, TJj 11 :s i, j :s k}. From the fact k -m + 1 :s k -1, by (34) and 
(14) we obtain oi 18k = O. Thus {OJ, TJjll :s i, j :s k} satisfies the corresponding 
(34). By (9) for the OjS and (12), we obtain (13) and (14) for the o;s and TJjs. Thus 
from the fact oi ITJk = ~r ITJk = -1 we obtain that {OJ, TJjll :s i, j :s k} satisfies 
the corresponding (35). 
For any 1 :s i < m and 1 :s j :s k it holds that j - m + 1 :s k - i. Then by the 
minimality of m and (14) we obtain 
(38) 
For any 1 :s j :s k - 1, it holds that j - m + 1 :s k - m :s k - 1. Thus by the definition 
ofm, (14), and (11), we obtaino~loj = O. Note that by the fact k -m + 1 :s k -1, 
(11), (37), and the definition of a, we obtain 
o~ 18k = ~~ I ~k + a(~~ I TJk-m+l + TJi I ~k) + a2TJi I TJk-m+l = o. 
(39) 
If {OJ 11 :s i :s k} still do not satisfy (36), by (38) to (39) then 
Thus by induction, we can modify the ~j s to complete the proof of the lemma. 
0 
Now suppose (36) holds. We define ~k+j = TJ; for 1 :s i :s k. Using (35), (36), 
(9) for {~;}l:::j:::k. and (12) for {TJ;h:::; :::k, we obtain (11), (19), (20), and (21) for 
{~j } l:::j :::2k, and the fact that F = span {~; 11 :s i :s 2k}. Thus similar to the discussion 
of Case 1, we obtain a new symplectic base {o; 11 :s i :s 2k} of F such that (31) and 

24 
1 Algebraic aspects 
(32) hold, where the matrix MI in (31) is given by (2)-(5) with bk = O. Thus (8) 
holds in this case. 
This completes our study of the three basic cases. 
Now we can give the proof of the main result of this section. 
Proof of Theorem 1: Firstly by the fact 1 E a(M), we claim that at least one of 
Cases 1 to 3 must happen. If not, denote the set of all the Jordan blocks formed by 
linearly independent root vectors of M belonging to the eigenvalue 1 by :I = :10 U:lI, 
where:ll contains only all largest size Jordan blocks, and:lo contains all other possible 
smaller size Jordan blocks. Since 1 E a(M) then:ll I- 0. Let 11 = {~dl :s i :s q} 
be a Jordan block in :II. Since Cases 1 and 2 do not happen, together with (11) we 
obtain 
(40) 
For any 10 = {11 j 11 :s j :s p} E :10, it must hold that p < q by definition. Thus by 
(14) we have 
a 111j = 0, 
'Vl1j E 10· 
(41) 
For any 12 = {Yj 11 :s j :s q} E :II \ {11 }, since Cases 1 and 2 do not happen, it must 
hold that yr 1 Yq = O. Since Case 3 does not happen, together with (40) it must hold 
that ~r 1 Yq = o. Thus together with (14) we obtain 
(42) 
Then (40) to (42) show that ~I is an isotropic element of the invariant root vector 
subspace EI (M) of M belonging to the eigenvalue 1. This contradicts the fact that 
E I (M) is a symplectic subspace of R 2n , and proves our claim. 
Then by Case 1,2, or 3, we can get (31) and (32), and carry out the induction to 
complete the proof of the theorem. 
1.5 Normal forms for the eigenvalue -1 
In this section we introduce the normal forms of symplectic matrices having eigen-
value -1. Using lemmas corresponding to Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3, we obtain the fol-
lowing Theorem 1. Since the proofs are similar to those of Section 1.4, we only 
describe the results and omit all the proofs.

P E Sp(2n) and mEN such that

the invariant root vector space of M belonging to the eigenvalue -1; then 2 :Lr=o ki = 
2ko + dim E-1 (M) = 2n. Moreover, corresponding (4.7) and (4.8) also hold. 
1.6 Normal forms for eigenvalues in U\R 
In this section, we derive the normal forms of symplectic matrices having non-real 
eigenvalues on the unit circle. Throughout this section, we fix (J) E U\R and denote 
by (J) = cos 8 + R 
sin 8 for some ° 
:s 8 :s 2n. Note that in this case it always 
holds that sin 8 =1= 0. For cP E R define

Using the root vectors {17i, ~i } here to replace the role of root vectors ~i in Cases 1 
and 2 of Section 4, the normal forms can be derived for the symplectic matrices which 
possess non-real eigenvalues on the unit circle. We start with the one Jordan block 
case with even size number p = 2k. 
Case 1 Suppose ME Sp(2n) possesses root vectors Q = {~i, 17i E R 2nll :s i :s p} 
for some p = 2k E 2N in a Jordan block belonging to the eigenvalue W E U \ R

E R2n we denote by (VI, ... , vm) the 2n x m matrix formed by them. Let V = 
span(Q). Based upon the root vectors Q, we need to construct 2n x 2 matrices Pi 
for 1 :s i :s 2k such that the column vectors of the matrix P = (PI, ... , P2k) form 
a symplectic base of V. We carry out the discussion in three steps.

in two subcases below according to the value of (bi' ai). Note that by (8) and (9), we 
have (bi' ai) =1= (0,0) for all these is.

By (14), (16), and (19) we obtain 
M PHi = Pk+i R(O)

By (20), C2k(W) is a 2k x 2k matrix of 2 x 2 blockwise lower triangular 
matrices, and the diagonal elements of C2k(W) are all R(fJ). Because M E Sp(2n), 
the column vectors of P form a symplectic base of V and MI E Sp(2k). Therefore 
A2k(W)T C2k(W) = 1, and then C2k(W) is of the following form:

and (24) implies that B2k(b) is a 2k x 2k matrix formed by 2 x 2 real matrices bi.}: 
B2k(b) = (bi ,}h:'Oi,}:'Ok. 
bi,) = 0 if j > i + 1. 
(28) 
Since MI is symplectic, B2k(b)T C2k(W) = C2k(W)T B2k(b). 
Now by (21)-(22) we can extend P to a matrix 6. E Sp(2n) such that the column 
vectors of (PI, ... , Pk) form the I-st to 2k-th columns and the column vectors of 
(Pk+l, ... , P2k) form the (n + l)-st to (n + 2k)-th columns of 6., and for some 
Mo E Sp(2(n - 2k»), 
(29) 
Now we continue the study of the normal forms of symplectic matrices having 
eigenvalue W E U\R which possess a Jordan block with odd size number p = 2k + 1. 
Case 2 Suppose M E Sp(2n) possesses root vectors Q = {~i , 1)i E R 2n 11 ::::; i ::::; p} 
for some p = 2k + 1 with an integer k :::: 0 in a Jordan block belonging to the 
eigenvalue W E U\R satisfying (1), (2), and the condition 
(30) 
Let V = span(Q). Similar to the study of Case 1, we construct a symplectic base 
P = (PI, ... , P2k) of V through several steps. Since the discussion is very similar 
to that in Case 1, we are rather sketchy here. If k = 0, we only need to carry out the 
following Step 2 to get the symplectic base {Ol, 02} of V, (24), and (29) with 
MI = NI (w, 0) = R(e), w = iR, e = fJ 
or 
-
fJ , 
(31) 
according to bl < 0 or bl > 0 respectively. Thus we suppose k :::: 1 in the following. 
Step 1 The definition of Pi for 1 ::::; i ::::; k. 
For 1 ::::; i ::::; k define 
(32) 

30

Step 2 The definition of P2k+ I . 
By Lemma 5, we have ak+ I = O. By (30) we distinguish our study in two subcases 
according to the sign of bk+ I. 
If bk+1 < 0, multiplying all ~i and rJi by 1/lbk+III/2, without loss of generality 
we may assume bk+ I = -1. We define 
82k+1 = rJk+l, 
84k+2 = ~k+I, 
P2k+1 = (82k+l, 84k+2). 
(33) 
If bk+1 > 0, multiplying all ~i and rJi by 1/lh+III/2, without loss of generality 
we may assume h+ I = 1. We define 
Step 3 The definition of Pk+i for i = k, ... , 1. 
Based on (rJ2k-i+2, ~2k-i+2) for i = k, ... , 1, similar to the study in Steps 2 
and 3 of Case 1, we can define Pk+i = (82(k+i), 82(k+i)+d so that

Pk+i R«(}) 
for 
1 ~ i ~ k. 
+com{Pk+h+l, max(k - h, O)Ph+I, Ph, Ph-II i ~ h ~ k}. 
Thus we obtain that the column vectors of 
P == (PI, ... , Pk. 82k+1, Pk+I, ... , P2k. 84k+2) 
form a symplectic base of V = spann, and (24) holds. Here M I is of the following 
form with 2k x 2k matrices A, B, C, and 2k x 1 matrices D, E, F, C:

if bk+1 = -1, 
D = (0, ... , 0, 0, l)T, E = (0, ... ,0, 1, O)T, 
if bk+1 = 1. 
(35) 
(36) 
(37) 
Note that in this case, the last two rows of B can not be formed by only 2 x 2 zero 
matrices. Now we can extend P to a matrix ~ E Sp(2n) such that (29) holds for 
some Mo E Sp(2(n - 2k - 1)). 

1.6 Normalforms for eigenvalues in U\R

Note that dime kerc(MI - wI) = I in Cases 1 and 2, because MI comes from a 
single Jordan block of M. 
To continue our study for the case of more than one Jordan block, we need the 
following Lemmas 6, 7, and 9, whose proofs are similar to those of Lemmas 1 to 5, 
and are omitted. 
Lemma 6 Suppose M E Sp(2n) possesses root vectors Q = {~i, 17i E R 2n 11 :s i :s 
p} and Q = {~i' iji E R2n 11 :s i :s q} for some p, q E N in two Jordan blocks 
belonging to the eigenvalue wE U\R such that (1) and (2) holdfor Q, and that for 
1 :s j :s q and ~o = ijo = 0,

Lemma 7 Under the assumption of Lemma 6, we suppose q ::::: p. Let Vi 
span{~i' ijdfor I :s i :s q. Then 
VI :s j :s q - i, 1 :s i :s p.

Lemma 9 Under the assumption of Lemma 6, suppose q = p. Then 
Vi = 2, ... , p. 
Now we continue our study on the normal forms.

Case 3 Suppose M E Sp(2n) satisfies the assumptions of Lemma 6 with q = p = k 
for some pEN and the conditions 
(38)

Note that by (38)-(40) and Lemmas 5 and 9, 
bi = ai = bi = ai = 0, 
(Bi, Ai) i= (0,0), 
\/1 SiS k. 
(41) 
Next we reduce our study of Case 3 to the study of Case 1. 
Denote by Vi = span{~i, rli} for 1 SiS k. We need the following lemma. 
Lemma 10 Under the assumption of Case 3, without loss of generality, we may 
assume that 
\/1 S i, j S k. 
(42) 
Proof: We follow the idea of the proof of Lemma 4.2. Assume (42) does not hold. 
Let m = m(Q) be the least integer in [1, k] such that there exists the least integer 
q E [m, k] satisfying Vm I- Vq • By the minimality of m, we must have q = k. By 
(38), we must have m > 1. 
Denote Pi = (rli, ~i), Qi = (ryi, €i), and Ri = (€i, -ryi) for ° SiS k. Define 
Xi

where A and B are 2 x 2 matrices defined by A = aRea) and B = bR(f3) with real 
numbers a, b, a, f3 to be determined later. Let E> = (Xl, ... , Xk). 
Then we have 
MXi = XiR(8) + Xi-I, 
\/1 SiS k. 
By the fact m > 1, it holds that span(E>, Q) = span(Q, Q) and 
(bl(E»,a)(E>)) = (b),al) = (0,0), 
(Bk(E>, Q), Ak(E>, Q)) 
(Bb Ak) i= (0,0). 
Thus the conditions of Case 3 still hold for E> and Q. 
On the other hand, for 1 S i < m and 1 S j S k we obtain XT JX j = ° 
by 
Lemma 7 and the fact j - m + 1 S k - (m + 1) s k - i. For 1 S j < m we obtain 

1.6 Normalforms for eigenvalues in U\R 
33 
X~JXj = 0 by Lemma 7. For m ::: j < k we obtain X~JXj = 0 by Lemma 7. 
Finally by Lemma 7 again and m > 1 we have 
X~JXk = P;;; J Pk + (P;;; JQk-m+]A + AT Qf J Pk) 
(43) 
By (3) we obtain 
pT J Pk = (x y) .

Thus to make the right-hand side of (43) be zero, we need to solve the following 
equation systems for a, b, a-, and f3, 
(c1A- + slB+)a + (c2B- - S2A+)b = -x, 
(cIB- - slA+)a + (-c2A- - S2B+)b = -yo 
The coefficient determinant of this linear system on a and b is given by 
(44) 
(45) 
D = -CIC2(A~ + B~ ) - S]S2(At + B~J -
(CIS2 + s]c2)(A_B+ - A+B_). 
Since by (40) it holds that (Ak, Bk) i= (0,0), we must have 
Thus we can choose a- and f3 E R suitably such that D i= O. Then we define a and 
b E R by (44) and (45). By this choice we obtain X~ J Xk = 0 when m > 1. 
Now if (42) still does not hold for G, by the above discussion we obtain 
meG) ::: m + 1 = m(Q) + l. 
Thus by induction, we can modify Q to complete the proof of the lemma. 
D 
Now suppose (42) holds. As in Section 2, we can define ~k+i = ~i and lJk+i = iJi 
for 1 ::: i ::: k, and then carry out the study of Case 1 to obtain the normal form given 
by (25)-(28). Note that dime kerdM] - wI) = 2 in Case 3, because Ml comes from 
two Jordan blocks of M for the eigenvalue w.

We have completed our study of the three basic cases. 
Now the following is the main result in this section. 
Theorem 11 Suppose ME Sp(2n) possesses the eigenvalue WE U\R Then there

wI) = 1 or 2, (31) or (35)-(37) with dime kerc(Mi - wI) = 1 for 1 :::: i :::: m. We 
denote by E(J)(M) the invariant root vector space of M belonging to the eigenvalue 
w; then 2 L:~=o ki = 2ko + dim E(J)(M) = 2n. 
Proof: Based upon the three basic cases we studied earlier, the proof of this theorem 
follows from that of Theorem 4.1, and therefore is omitted.

proofs in this section can be found in [HaL 1]. 
For the case of an eigenvalue pair, we have 
Theorem 1 Suppose M E Sp(2n) possesses the eigenvalue pair A = {A, A -I} c 
R\ {O, ±1}. Then there exist P E Sp(2n) and mEN such that 
p- I M P = Mlo··· oMmoMo,

with Aki (A) and Cki (A) defined by (4.3) and (404) respectively for 1 :S i :S m, and 
2 Lr=o ki = 2ko + dim E A (M) = 2n for E A (M) defined to be the invariant root 
vector space of M belonging to the eigenvalue pair A. 
Note that by the proof of Theorem 4. 1, considering the simplest case of p - l M P = 
Ml in (1), the M in the above Theorem 1 can be reduced to 
(3) 
where An(A), Cn(A), and Bn(A, b) with some b = (bI, ... , bn) E R n are given by 
(4.3)-(4.5) in Section 104. Thus the proof of Theorem 1 is reduced to the proof of the 
following claim: 
Claim: Bn(A, b) = 0 in (3). 
In fact, let j E [1, n] be the greatest integer such that b} i= O. Then the vectors 
where ft = -( _A)}-l b) I(A - A-I), also form a symplectic basis of the space R2n. 
In terms of this basis, the above matrix MI still has the form (3), and furthermore the 
(j - 1, j)-th entry of Ml satisfies d)-I ,} = ft. Since in this case, the corresponding 
Bn (A, b) block of Ml must be still lower triangular, this proves ft = 0, i.e. b} = O. 
The claim is proved. 
For the case of eigenvalue quadruple 11.= {pw, pi», p - 1w, p-1i»} C C\(UU R), 
fix w E U\R and denote w = cos e + sin e J=T for some 0 :S e :S 2n. Note that in

where Mo E Sp(2ko) with ko 2: 0 and A n a(Mo) = 0. For 1 ::s i ::s m, it 
holds that ki 2: 1, Mi E Sp(4ki) is of the form Mi = Nki(P, (}) given by (4), and 
2ko + 4 L:r=o ki = 2ko + dim E A (M) = 2n for E A (M) being the root vector space 
of M belonging to the eigenvalue group A. 
Summarizing our discussion on normal forms of symplectic matrices in this 
chapter, we obtain the following result. 
Theorem 3 For any M E Sp(2n), there exist P E Sp(2n), an integer p E [0, n], 
normal forms Mi 
E Sp(2ki) of eigenvalues Ai for 1::s 
< p defined in the 
Sections 1.4 to 1.7, such that L:;=l ki = n and it holds that 
PMP-1 = MIO· ··oMp .

Note that for any M E Sp(2n), 
dime kercCM ± I) = dimR kerR(M ± 1).

Definition 1 For any ME Sp(2n) and wE U, we define the w-nullity vw(M) of M 
by 
vw(M) = dime kercCM - wI). 
(2) 
We define the hyperbolic index a (M) of M by the mod 2 number of the total algebraic 
multiplicity of negative eigenvalues of M which are strictly less than -1, and the 
elliptic height e(M) of M by the total algebraic mUltiplicity of all eigenvalues of M 
on U. An ME Sp(2n) is 
truly hyperbolic, 
hyperbolic, 
elliptic, 
strongly elliptic, 
if e(M) = 0, 
if 
1 E a(M) and e(M) = 2, 
if e(M) = 2n, 
if a(M) C U\ {I}. 

1.8 Basic normal forms

We denote by Spth(2n), Sph(2n), Spe(2n), and Spse(2n) the subsets of all truly 
hyperbolic, hyperbolic, elliptic, strongly elliptic matrices in Sp(2n) respectively. 
By Theorem 3.1, for any M E Sp(2n), it holds that e(M) E 2Z and 0 :'S e(M) :'S 
2n. Note that the concept ofhyperbolicity comes from the study of periodic solutions 
of autonomous Hamiltonian systems. In this case, 1 is always a Floquet multiplier 
with multiplicity at least two of the given periodic solution. We shall further study 
the structures of these subsets of Sp(2n) in the next chapter. 
Another important function we need is the following modification of the charac-
teristic function of M defined by (3.2): for W E U and M E Sp(2n), we define 
(3) 
Lemma 2 D is a real and real smooth function on U x Sp(2n). 
Proof: From (3.3) we obtain Dw(M) = Dw(M). Thus Dw(M) is real. It is clearly 
smooth. 
D 
For W E U, we define the w-singular set Sp(2n)~ of Sp(2n) and its subsets 
M~ (2n) with 0 :'S k :'S 2n by 
Sp(2n)~ 
M~(2n) 
{M E Sp(2n) I Dw(M) = O}, 
{M E Sp(2n) I vw(M) = k}. 
We define the w-regular sets of Sp(2n) by 
Sp(2n); = {M E Sp(2n) I ± Dw(M) < OJ, 
Sp(2n)~ = Sp(2n)t U Sp(2n)~. 
By Theorem 3.1 we obtain 
Sp(2n)~ = Sp(2n)~, 
Sp(2n)~ = Sp(2n);. 
Note that when w = 1, we have 
YO :'S k :'S 2n. 
(4) 
(5)

(7) 
For simplicity, we omit the subindex w for w = 1 in these notations, when there is no 
confusion. The set Sp(2n)* is called the regular part of Sp(2n). The codimension 
1 hypersurface Sp(2n)o is called the singular part of Sp(2n). We write Mw(2n) for 
M~ (2n), which is the regular part of the hypersurface Sp(2n )~. 
In order to study the topological structures of subsets of Sp(2n) with n 2: 2 as well 
as the index functions, we study perturbations on normal form matrices defined in 
Sections 4 to 7 to connect the given matrix to an easier one. To carry out the concrete 
computations, we need the following lemma.

1 Algebraic aspects 
Lemma 3 Suppose M = (~ ~) E £(R2n) is of the square block form, A is 
invertible, and AC = CA. Then 
det M = det(AD - C B). 
Proof: Since A is invertible, we have the matrix identity 
Thus 
det M = (det A)(det(D - CA -I B)) = det(AD - ACA -I B). 
From AC = CA, the lemma follows. 
D 
Lemma 4 For any M E Sp(2n) and a path y E C([O, 1], Sp(2n)), suppose A E 
u(M). Then the algebraic and geometric multiplicities and the Krein type of A E 
u(y(t)-I My(t)) are the same as those of M for any t E [0, 1]. 
Proof: By direct computations. 
D 
DefinitionS For any ME Sp(2n) andw E U, we define the w-homotopy seH2w(M) 
of M in Sp(2n) by 
Qw(M) = {N E Sp(2n) I vw(N) = vw(M)}, 
(8) 
and the homotopy set Q(M) of Min Sp(2n) by 
Q(M) = {N E Sp(2n) lu(N) n U = u(M) n U, and 
(9) 
v;.JN) = v).(M) VA E u(M) n U}. 
We denote by QO(M) (or Q~(M)) the path connected component ofQ(M) (Qw(M)) 
which contains M, and call it the homotopy component (or w-homotopy compo-
nent) of Min Sp(2n). 
For any ME Sp(2n), we define the conjugacy class of Min Sp(2n) by 
[M] = {N E Sp(2n) IN = p-I M P for some P E Sp(2n)}. 
Since Sp(2n) is path connected, [M] C QO(M) c Q~(M) for all wE U. 
For any M E Sp(2n), to find much simpler elements in QO(M) or Q~(M) than 
the <>-product of the normal forms in (7.8), we consider perturbations on the normal 
forms. For a E R, we define 
Rk(a) = hk-2<>R(a)<>hn-2k. 
Vk = 1, ... , n. 
Here 10 means that this component does not appear at all.

Definition 6 A normal form Nn (w, B) E Sp(2n) belonging to the eigenvalue W E U

The next example shows that the property (12) for normal forms need not hold if 
we replace N2 (l , b) by some M which is not a normal form. This example is due to 
Nancy Hingston.

Note thatthere exists P E Sp(4) such that p-I M P = h oNl(l, -1) and vI(M) = 3. 
Then by direct computation we get 
vI(MR]C8» = 1, 
V1 (M R2(8» = 1, 
VI (MRl(81)R2C82» = 0, 
if and only if 8 -I 0 mod 2n, 
if and only if 8 -I 0 mod 2n, 
if and only if both 81 and 82 -I 0 mod 2n. 
Thus for 8, E [-1, 1] and 82 E [-1, 1] \ {0} we obtain 
VI (M R, (8))) -

Next using normal forms, we study the representations of M E Sp(2n) in its 
homotopy components, i.e., for any M E Sp(2n), to find the simplest matrix in 
QOCM) or Q~(M). Let D(A) = diag(A, A -I) for A E R \ {O}. 
Case 1 M = Nn(l, B) E M~(2n) with n 2: 2. FOrE > 0 small enough, we define

Applying Theorem 7.3 to f(I), we obtain P E Sp(2n) such that Pf(I)P- I = 
NI (A , c)oMo with a(Mo) n U = 0. By the path connectedness of Sp(2n), M can be 
connected to NI(1, c)oMo within nO(M). 
Case 2 M = Nn(1, B) E Mr(2n) with n ~ 2. We define f(t) = Nn(1, (1 - t)B) 
for t E [0, 1] and 
get) = f(1)[hoD(I + tt(n-2)oh], 
"It E [0, 1]. 
Applying Theorem 7.3 to g(1), we obtain a path h in nI (g(1» which connects g(I) 
to N2(I, c)oMo with a(Mo) n U = 0. For t E [0, 1] we define 4 x 4 matrix paths

Then the path [(l/t * ¢)oMo] * h * g * f connects M to hoD(2)oMo in nO(M). 
Case 3 M = Nn(w, B) E M1(2n) is a normal form of the eigenvalue wE U\R 
with n ~ 2. For E > 0 small enough, we define 
"It E [0, 1], 
where k = 2 if M is given by (6.25), and k = 1 if M is given by (6.35). Then 
f(t) E nO(M) for all t E [0, 1]. Thus together with Theorem 7.3, M can be 
connected to Nk(W, c)oMo within nO(M) with W = W or w, a(Mo) n U = 0, and 
some c. 
Case 4 M = Nn(w, B) E M~(2n) is a normal form of the eigenvalue wE U\R 
with n ~ 2 given by (6.25). We define f(t) = Nn(w, (1 - t)B) and 
"It E [0, 1]. 
Then there exists a path h in M~(2n) which connects g(1) to N2(W, O)oMo with 
e = () or 2n - () and Mo E Sp(2n - 4) satisfies a(Mo) n U = 0. For any t E [0, 1] 
we define

where c = cose and s = sine. By direct computation we obtain h(t) E M~(4) for 
all t E [0, 1]. Note that N2(W, 0) is connected to R(e)oR( -e) within M~(4) by the 
path h. Thus R(e)oR( -e)oMo is in nO(M). 

1.8 Basic normalforms 
41 
Note that N n (w, B) for W E U in other cases can also be connected to the <>-product 
of basic normal forms defined below and matrices possessing no eigenvalues on U. 
Since the proofs are similar, they are omitted. 
Definition 9 A normalform matrix M = Nn (w, B) E Sp(2n) defined above is a basic 
normalform of eigenvalue w E U ifn = 1 andw E U, or M = N2(W, B) E M1(4) 
and W E U\R. D(2) and D( -2) are basic normal forms of eigenvalues outside U. 
More explicitly, the following are the basic normal forms for eigenvalues in U: 
R«(}) = (c~s () 
sm () - Sin(}) 
cos () 
, 
A = ±1, b = ±1, 0, 
() E (0, n) U (n, 2n), 
N2(W, b) = (RO«(}) 
b) 
() E (0, n) U (n, 2n), 
R«(}) 
, 
b = (b i 
b2 ), 
b3 
b4 
bi E R, b2 =1= b3. 
We also denote NJ (eBR, 0) = R«(}). 
(15) 
(16) 
(17) 
Together with Theorem 7.3 and our above discussion, we obtain the following 
result: 
Theorem 10 For any M E Sp(2n), there is a path f : [0,1] -+ QO(M) such that 
f(O) = M and 
(18) 
where each Mi (Wi) is a basic normal form of some eigenvalue Wi E U for 1 ::: i ::: k, 
and the symplectic matrix Mo satisfies (J(Mo) n U = 0. 
Note that in Corollary 2.3.8 below, we shall further prove that Mo can be connected 
within QO(Mo) to a <>-product of basic normal forms D(2) and D( -2). 
Definition 11 A basic normal form matrix M E Sp(2n) is trivial, if for sufficiently 
small a > 0, M R«t - l)atn possesses no eigenvalues on U for t E [0, 1), and is 
non-trivial otherwise. 
Note that among all the basic normal forms, the matrices NJ(1, -1), NI(-I, 1), 
D(2), D(-2), N2(W, b) and N2CW, b) with W = exp«(}H) E U\R and (b2-
b3) sin () > 0 are trivial, and any other basic normal form matrix M = N n (w, B) E 
Sp(2n) with n = 1 or 2 and W E U is non-trivial by our study in Section 9 below. 
For our later study of the splitting numbers in the index theory, we introduce the 
following concept of ultimate type of any WE U as an eigenvalue of ME Sp(2n). 
Definition 12 For any basic normalform M E Sp(2n) of eigenvalue W E U n(J(M), 
we define the ultimate type (p, q) of W for M to be its usual Krein type if M is 

42 
i 
Algebraic aspects 
non-trivial, and to be (0,0) if M is trivial. For any M E Sp(2n), we define the 
ultimate type of w for M to be (0,0) if w E U \ a(M). For any M E Sp(2n), 
by Theorem 10 there exists a o-product expansion (18) in the homotopy component 
QO(M) of M where each Mi is a basic normal form of eigenvalue in U for 1 :s i :s k 
and a (Mo) n U = 0. Denote the ultimate type of w for Mi by (pi, qi) for ° 
:s i :s k. 
Let p = 'L.7=0 Pi and q = 'L.7=Oqi. We define the ultimate type of w for M 
by (p, q). 
Proposition 13 The ultimate type of w E U for M E Sp(2n) is uniquely determined 
by w and M, therefore is well defined. it is constant on QO(M) for fixed w E U. 
Proof: It suffices to notice that the <>-product (18) is uniquely determined by M 
independent of the arranging order of {MJ, ... , Mk, Mo} and the choice of the sym-
plectic matrix Mo satisfying w ¢ a(Mo), and (18) holds for any N E QO(M). But 
these two factors make no change in the ultimate type defined above. 
0 
Lemma 14 For w E U and M E Sp(2n), denote the Krein type and the ultimate 
type ofwfor M by (P, Q) and (p, q). Then 
P - p = Q -q:::: 0. 
(19) 
Proof: Note that (19) holds for all basic normal forms of eigenvalues in U. By 
Theorems 3.9 and 3.11, whenever the eigenvalue w leaves U by a perturbation on M, 
both the Krein positive and negative type numbers of w must decrease by the same 
integer. Therefore by the proof of Theorem 10, we obtain (19). 
0 
Remark 15 The homotopy component, basic normal forms, and the ultimate type of 
symplectic matrices were introduced in [Lon 16] of 1999 in order to give an algebraic 
characterization of splitting numbers of the index theory. These concepts will be 
further studied in Chapters 8 and 9. The results contained in this section are due to 
[LonI6]. 
1.9 Perturbations of basic normal forms 
Next we study perturbations on the basic normal forms. 
Part 1 Perturbations on the eigenvalue w = 1. 
We study first the perturbations of the basic normal form matrix NJ (1, b) of the 
eigenvalue 1 with b = ±1 or ° 
defined by (4.1). Here to simplify the discussion, we 
use the R 3-cylindrical coordinate decomposition of Sp(2) introduced in Section 2.1. 
Denote R+ = {r E R I r > O} and R- = {r E R I r < OJ. By direct computation 
we obtain 
{ Sp(2)? +' 
NJ(1, b) E

Sp(2)J,_'

for b > 0.

1.9 Perturbations of basic normal forms 
Since NI (1,1) E Sp(2)? _, there exists eo > 0 such that 
if 0 < e ~ eo, 
if 0 < -e ~ eo. 
Since NI (1, -1) E Sp(2)?,+, there exists eo > 0 such that 
a(NI (1, -l)R(e)) C {~~~' 
Note that NI (1,0) = h and 
a(NI(l, O)R(e)) c U\{l},

U sing the map from M to - M, the case of w = -1 can be reduced to that of 
w = 1; the details are left to the readers. 
When n = 1, the perturbations on the basic normal forms of the eigenvalue W E U 
can be read out directly from Figure 2.1.2. Next we consider the case of W E U\R 
for general n :::: 1. 
Lemma 1 For A and B E R suppose the polynomial equation, 
(5) 
possesses no real roots. Then 
1 ° (5) possesses two pairs of conjugate simple roots on U if and only if 4A 2

2° (5) possesses one pair of conjugate double roots on U if and only if 4A2

3° (5) possesses four simple roots away from U U R ifand only if4A2 + 2 < B.

that the conclusion of 8° holds with yeO) = N2(W, d).

have used 1 0. Setting S2 = 0 and C2 = 1 in (11), we obtain 
Thus 7° and 10° follow. 
According to the signs of (b2 - b3) sin () and cos (), there are four cases in the proof 
of 8°. Next we only prove the case for (b2 - b3) sin () > 0 and cos () > O. The other 
three cases are left to the readers.

-t()o < aCt) < 0 for 0 < t ::: 1, and f(sin(t()o), sin a (t()o)) = 0 for 0 ::: t ::: 1. 
Define 
y(t) = M[R(t()o)oR(a(t()o))], 
V t E [0, 1]. 
(18) 
Then from Dw(y(t)) = f(sin(t()o), sin(a(t()o)) = 0 we obtain {w, w} C u(y(t)) for 
all t E [0, 1].

On the other hand, by further requiring the above eo > 0 to be much smaller we 
obtain that for 0 ::: -S2 ::: sl ::: sin eo, 
provided 
(22) 
Thus g(SI, S2) is strictly monotone for el = teo and e2 = a(teo) with t E [0, 1], and 
then is always positive there. By 1° of Lemma 1, we obtain {cv, w} =F {A(t), A(t)} C 
a(y(t» for all t E (0, 1]. 
By 1 ° we also have 
Thus we need to find b such that (17), (22), (23), and (b2 - b3) sine> 0 hold. 
Define d = (dl, d2, d3, d4) by 
sine 
dl = 1/8, d4 = -48, d3 = 0, d2 = -(48 - 1/8).

Then (17), (22), (23), and (d2 - d3) sin e > 0 hold for b = d. Thus N2(CV, b) can be 
connected to N2(CV, d) within Mw(4). By 1° of Lemma 1 we obtain that the path y 
and N2(CV, d) E Sp(4) satisfy the requirements of 8°. 
The proof of 8° is complete. Then 9° follows by the same argument.

Similarly to our above discussion, we obtain 
Corollary 4 For any M E Sp(2n), there is a continuous path f : [0, 1] ---+ Sp(2n) 
such that f(O) = M and f(t) possesses only simple eigenvalues for 0 < t :::; 1. 
Next we consider perturbations on more general matrices. 
Theorem 5 For M E Sp(2n), suppose wE u(M) n (U\R) has Krein-type number 
(p, q) with p ~ 1 and q ~ 1. Then there exists a path f : [0, 1] ---+ Sp(2n) such that 
f(O) = M, for any t E (0, 1], W is an eigenvalue of f(t) with Krein-type number 
(p - 1, q - 1) if p + q > 2, {dt W, dtw, d-t w, d-tw} is a simple eigenvalue quadruple 
of f(t) for some d > 1, and all the eigenvalues of f(t) other than {w, w} are the 
same as those eigenvalues of M. 
Proof: By the normal form Theorem 7.3, there exists P 
E Sp(2n) such that 
p- 1 M P = MIO ... OMk is a o-product of normal forms. Then using a perturbation 
path g(t) on the corresponding normal forms with g(O) = 1 as in our discussion in 
Section 8, we obtain the required path f(t) = M Pg(t)P- 1•

Chapter 2 
Topological aspects 
For any fixed w belonging to the unit circle U in the complex plane C, all the 
symplectic matrices having w as an eigenvalue form a codimension 1 hypersurface 
in the symplectic group Sp(2n) = Sp(2n, R). Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of 
the topological structures of Sp(2n), these hypersurfaces and their complements in 
Sp(2n). 
In this chapter we first introduce the R3 -cylindrical coordinate representations of 
Sp(2). This representation gives a complete and intuitive picture for Sp(2), and is very 
suggestive for the higher dimensional case of Sp(2n). Then we study the topologies 
of Sp(2n), its regular subset Sp(2n)~ and singular hypersurface Sp(2n)~ for WE U. 
In this study, we need the following set of paths in Sp(2n). 
P,(2n) = {y E C([O, i], Sp(2n» I y(O) = l}, 
Vi> O. 
(1) 
For notational simplicity, when we deal with real vector spaces, we shall omit the 
subindex R. 
2.1 
Structures of Sp(2) and its subsets 
In this section, we introduce a geometric representation of Sp(2) = Sp(2, R) in R3 
given in [Lon6] of 1991. It provides an intuitive and suggestive model for our further 
study on the general theory of the topological structures of the symplectic group 
Sp(2n, R) and its subsets. To the author's knowledge, the only known different model 
of Sp(2) was given by I. Gelfand and V. Lidsikii in [GeLl] of 1955, where Sp(2) is 
mapped to an open solid torus via the toral coordinates and hyperbolic functions. 
For any matrix M E Sp(2), by the polar decomposition, M can be written in the 
form 
M=(r 
z 
) (COS8 
z 
(l + z2)jr 
sin 8 
- sin 8 ) 
cos 8 
' 
(1) 
where (r, 8, z) E R+ x Sl X R, R+ = {r E R I r > OJ, Sl = Rj(2;rR - n), 
and (r, 8, z) is uniquely determined by M. Viewing (r, 8, z) as the cylindrical coordi-
nates in R 3, we obtain a representation of Sp(2) in R3. In fact, this defines a Coo 
global diffeomorphism <f> from Sp(2) to R3\ {z-axis}. In the following, we identify 
elements in Sp(2) and its <f>-image in R3. 
Under this representation, it is easy to see that the two eigenvalues of M are 

2.1 Structures ofSp(2) and its subsets 
49 
which are either two reciprocal real numbers or two conjugate complex numbers on 
the unit circle U in the complex plane C. For (J) = cos q; + R 
sin q; E U and M 
in the form (1), we obtain 
(

D(j)(M) = 2cosq; -
r + -r-

and 
Sp(2); = {(r,e,z) E R+ x Sl x RJ ± (r2 +Z2 + l)cose > 2rcosq;}, 
Sp(2)~ 
{(r,e,z) E R+ x Sl x RJ (r2 +Z2 + l)cose = 2rcosq;}. 
Let Sp(2)~.± = fer, e, Z) E Sp(2)~ J ± sine> OJ. We then obtain 
Sp(2)~1 = Sp(2)~I , + U {l} U Sp(2)~1,_, 
Sp(2)~ = Sp(2)~,+ U Sp(2)~. _ . 
Here we especially interested in the cylindrical coordinate representation of the 
singular hypersurfaces Sp(2)~ for (J) E U. In Figure 1, we give this R3-cylindrical 
coordinate representation of Sp(2)o with the Descartes coordinates (x, y, z) = 
(r cos e, r sin e, z).

In Figure 2, the intersection of the plane {z = O} with the R3 -cylindrical coordinate 
representation of Sp(2)?, Sp(2)~ l' and Sp(2)~ for some (J) E U \ R are given. As 

50 
2 Topological aspects 
shown in Figure 2, for any W E U the set Sp(2)~ possesses precisely two path 
connected components Sp(2);;;- and Sp(2);, and it holds that 
D(2) == diag (2'~) E Sp(2)~ and 
D(-2) == diag (-2, -~) E Sp(2);;;. 
Fix an W E U \ R. It is easy to see that Sp(2) l' Sp(2):: I and Sp(2)~ are homeo-
morphic to R3. Sp(2) t and Sp(2) = 
I are homeomorphic to R\{ (x, y, z) E R3 I x 2 + 
Z2 :s y2}. Thus for any WE U, the set Sp(2)~ is simply connected in Sp(2), i.e., any 
closed curve inside Sp(2);;;- or Sp(2); can be continuously contracted inside Sp(2) to 
a point. 
When W = 1, in the singular hypersurface Sp(2)o == Sp(2)?, the identity matrix 
h is the only element which satisfies dimker(M - /) = 2. The regular part M(2) 
of Sp(2)? possesses precisely two path connected components Sp(2)~ = Sp(2)?,+ 
and Sp(2)~ = Sp(2)? _, both of which are smooth hypersurfaces diffeomorphic to 
R 2\{0}.

In order to further study the structure of Sp(2) near Sp(2)o, we consider the effect 
of the perturbation of the rotation matrix R«() defined in Section 1.6 on the singular 
hypersurface Sp(2)o. Because for any () E R it holds that det(R«() - /) = 2(1 -
cos (), for M = I, we obtain 
VI (M) -
VI (M R«()) = 2, if and only if () i= 0 mod 2n, 
and 
det(M R«() - /) = 0 if and only if () = 0 mod 2n. 
(2) 

2.2 The global structure ofSp(2n, R) 
51 
This shows that rotation perturbations starting from h always go into the same path 
connected component Sp(2)- of Sp(2)*. For any element in the regular part M(2) 
of Sp(2)o, we have the following results. 
Lemma 1 For any M E M (2), there exists eo > 0 such that for 0 < Ie I :::: eo, 
VI (M) -
VI (M R(e)) = 1, 
(3) 
det(M R(e) - 1) det(M R(-e) - 1) < o. 
(4) 
Proof: Let M = (: ~). Then from det(M - 1) = 0 and det M = 1, we obtain 
a + d = 2 and bc = -(a - 1)2. Thus from M t= I we obtain b t= c. Then for any 
e ER, 
det(M R(e) - 1) = 2(1 - cos e) + (c - b) sin e. 
Thus 
det(M R(e) - 1) = (sin e) (c - b) +. 
, 
[ 
2(1 - cos e)] 
sme 
"Ie t= 0 mod 2n. 
Then from limo--->o(1 - cos e) / sin e = 0, we obtain the lemma. 
o 
Here (4) in Lemma 1 points out that the rotation perturbations of opposite direction 
starting from an element in M (2) go into different path connected components. This 
can also be seen from Figures 1 and 2. 
Note that from the R 3-cylindrical coordinate representation introduced above, 
M(2) is orientable, and so is Sp(2)0. In particular we can define the positive 
direction of Sp(2) at any of its elements M to be the direction of 1, M R(te) It=o 
for small enough e > o. We call this orientation the natural orientation of Sp(2)0. 
The propertiesofSp(2)~1 andSp(2)~ for some w E U\Rcan be obtained similarly. 
In the following sections, we shall prove that the higher dimensional symplectic 
group Sp(2n) and its corresponding subsets possess similar topological structures. 
2.2 The global structure of Sp(2n, R) 
In this section, we study the global structure of the symplectic group Sp(2n) estab-
lished by I. Gelfand and V. Lidskii in [GeU] and 1. Moser [Mosl] in the 1950s. 
Using the polar decomposition of symplectic matrices and the homeomorphism 
Sp(2n, R) n O(2n, R) ~ U(n, C) == U(n), 
established in Section 1.1, we study the global topological structure of Sp(2n) 
Sp(2n, R) in this section. The main result is the following theorem. 

52 
2 
Topological aspects 
Theorem 1 (I. Gelfand and V. Lidskii [GeLl], J. Moser [Most]). The symplectic 
group Sp(2n) is homeomorphic to the topological product of the unit circle U in the 
complex plane C and a simply connected topological space. 
The proof of this theorem is carned out by the following lemmas. Denote the set 
of all2n x 2n positive definite symmetric symplectic matrices by PSS(2n). 
Lemma 2 The symplectic group Sp(2n) is homeomorphic to the topological product 
ofPSS(2n) and Sp(2n) n O(2n), where O(2n) = O(2n, R). 
Proof: The polar decomposition proved in Lemma 1.1.3 gives this homeomorphism. o 
Lemma 3 PSS(2n) is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space R n(n+l). 
Proof: Denote by Sen) the subgroup of .c(Rn ) formed by all n x n symmetric 
matrices. In the proof of Lemma 1.1.4, we have established a one to one corre-
spondence between elements in PSS(2n) and matrices in .c(R2n ) with the form 
M = (~ !A) with A 
and B 
belonging to Sen). This yields a homeomorphism 
between PSS(2n) and Sen) x Sen). Since Sen) is homeomorphic to the Euclidean 
space R n(n+l)/2, we obtain the lemma. 
0 
Lemma 4 The orthogonal symplectic group Sp(2n) n O(2n) is homeomorphic to 
the unitary group U(n) = U(n, C). 
Proof: In the proof of Lemma 1.1.5, a one to one correspondence between any 
orthogonal symplectic matrix U = (_AB !) and the unitary matrix A + R B 
is established. This correspondence gives the homeomorphism from Sp(2n) n 0 (2n) 
to U(n). 
0 
Remark 5 The homeomorphism obtained in Lemma 4 is also a group isomorphism. 
Lemma 6 The unitary group U (n) is homeomorphic to the topological product of the 
unit circle U in the complex plane C and the unitary unimodule group SU (n). Recall 
that SU (n) is the subgroup of U (n) formed by those matrices with determinant 1. 
Proof: Let A be any unitary matrix. Denote eRa = det A for some a E R. Define 
an n x n matrix B = diag(e-Ra , 1, ... , I)A. Then B is unitary and unimodule, 
i.e., det B = 1. Define an n x n matrix D = diag(eRa , 1, ... , 1). Then 
A=DB. 
(1) 
Denote the set of all matrices in the form of D by D(n). Then it is easy to see that 
the decomposition (1) of any unitary matrix A in D(n) x SU (n) is unique. This 
decomposition yields the homeomorphism from U(n) to D(n) x SU(n). Note that 
D(n) is homeomorphic to the unit circle U in C. The lemma is proved.

2.2 The global structure ofSp(2n, R) 
53 
Lemma 7 (cf. H. Weyl [Weyl]). The unitary unimodule group SU(n) is simply 
connected. 
Proof: Since SU(1) contains only one element 1, it is simply connected. Suppose 
n > 1. Then SU(n - 1) can be viewed as a subgroup of SU(n) consisting of all 
matrices of the fonn 
M = (~~ 
~) 
o * 
* 
Two elements A and A' in SU(n) are left equivalent mod this subgroup, i.e. they 
belong to the same coset of SU (n - 1), if and only if they possess the same first row. 
But their first row must have the fonn 
(2) 
satisfying 
n L lad2 = l. 
(3) 
i= l 
On the other hand, given any vector a E en satisfying (3), it can be completed to a 
unitary unimodule basis {a , e2, ... , en} of en. Thus any such a vector can be viewed 
as the first row of some unitary unimodule matrix. Therefore the set M fonned by 
the above mentioned cosets is homeomorphic to the unit sphere s2n-l in the real 
Euclidean space R2n with {Re(ai), Im(ai) Ii = 1, ... , n} as real coordinates. When 
n > 1, the sphere s2n-l is simply connected. Given any closed curve C in SU(n), 
it is also a closed curve in M. Thus it can be contracted to the coset corresponding 
to the point (1,0, ... ,0). Therefore closed curves in SU(n) can be contracted into 
SU(n - 1). By induction, we complete the proof. 
D 
Now we can give 
The proof of Theorem 1: By Lemmas 2, 3, 4, and 6, we obtain homeomorphisms: 
Sp(2n) 
PSS(2n) x (Sp(2n) n O(2n» 
Rn(n+l) x U(n) 
Rn(n+l) x U x SU(n). 
By Lemma 7, SU(n) is simply connected. This proves the theorem. 
(4) 
Note that in our proof of Theorem 1, we have used results from [MoZ1] and [Wey 1] 
too. 
From Theorem 1 we obtain immediately

Topological aspects 
Corollary 8 The symplectic group Sp(2n) is path connected. 
Theorem 9 The symplectic group Sp(2n) fonn a 2n2 + n real dimensional manifold. 
Proof: Note that the homeomorphisms in (4) are locally smooth. Thus Sp(2n) fonn 
a real manifold. We claim 
(5) 
We prove this claim by induction. When n = 1, (5) holds trivially. Suppose the claim 
holds for SU(n - 1). Then by the proof of Lemma 7, there exists a homeomorphism 
from SU(n) to SU(n - 1) X s2n-l. Thus we obtain the claim: 
By (4) we obtain 
dimR Sp(2n) = n(n + 1) + 1 + (n2 - 1) = 2n2 + n. 
The proof is complete. 
o 
Theorem 10 The symplectic group Sp(2n) possesses a natural orientation induced 
from the Euclidean spaces via the representation (4). 
Proof: By the proof of Lemma 7, SU(n) possesses a natural orientation induced 
from unit spheres in the Euclidean spaces. Thus (4) induces a natural orientation 
from the Euclidean spaces to Sp(2n).

2.3 Hyperbolic symplectic matrix set 
In this section, we study the topologies of the sets of truly hyperbolic and hyperbolic 
symplectic matrices in Sp(2n) defined in Section 1.8. Here we need the hyperbolic 
index a : Un:O:1Sp(2n) ---+ to, I} of Definition 1.8.1. Results in this section were 
proved in [Lon 18] of 2000, and by T. An and the author in [LoA 1] of 1998. Some of 
this discussion also uses ideas from [CoZ2] and [DoLl]. 
Theorem 1 The set Spth(2) possesses precisely two path connected components 
defined by 
Spfh(2) = (M E Spth(2) I a(M) = i}, 
for i = 0,1. 
(1) 
It holds that 
Spbh(2) = Sp(2)+, 
(2) 
Spfh(2) = -Sp(2)+ == {-M I ME Sp(2)+}. 

2.3 Hyperbolic symplectic matrix set 
55 
They are simply connected in Sp(2). The hyperbolic set Sph (2) is path connected, 
simply connected, and 
(3) 
Proof: This theorem follows from the R3 -cylindrical coordinate representation of 
Sp(2) introduced in Section 2.1. 
D 
Since Spbh(2) = Sp(2)i and Sp~h(2) = Sp(2):=1' we got an intuitive picture of 
them in Figure 1.2. For the topological structures of the higher dimensional Spth (2n) 
and Sph(2n), we have the following main results. 
Theorem 2 The set Spth(2n) with n ::: 1 possesses precisely two path connected 
components defined by 
Spfh(2n) = {M E Spth(2n) I a(M) = i}, 
for i = 0,1. 
(4) 
Both Spbh(2n) and Spfh(2n) are simply connected in Sp(2n). 
Theorem 3 The set Sph (2n) with n ::: 2 possesses precisely two path connected 
components defined by 
SP7(2n) = {M E Sph(2n) I a(M) = i}, 
for i = 0,1. 
(5) 
Both SP3 (2n) and SP7 (2n) are simply connected in Sp(2n). 
For any two curves 1/r and ¢ : [0, r] ~ Sp(2n) with r > ° 
satisfying 1/r (r) = ¢ (0), 
we define their joint curve by 
¢ * 1/r(t) = {1/r(2t), 
¢(2t - r), 
if O:s t :S r /2, 
if r /2 :S t :S To 
The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 are completed by the following lemmas. 
(6) 
Lemma 4 The hyperbolic index function a: Sp(2n) ~ {O, I} is locally constant. 
Proof: For any M E Sp(2n), the only way that, under a small perturbation, any of 
its real eigenvalue that are not on U can leave R is to leave as a pair of reciprocal 
eigenvalues of an even multiplicity and to yield an eigenvalue quadruple. Thus the 
lemma holds. 
D 
Lemma 5 Forn::: 1 and any ME Spth(2n), there exists a path f E C([O, 1], Spth 
(2n)) such that f(O) = M and 
f(1) = M;; == D(2)on, 
if a(M) = 0, 
f(l) = M;; == D( -2)oD(2)o(n- I), 
where we recall D(a) = diag{a, a-I} for a E R \ {OJ. 
if a(M) = 1, 
(7) 
(8) 
Proof: Fix M E Spth(2n). The case of n = 1 has been studied in Theorem 1. We 
prove the lemma for n ::: 2 in six steps. 

56 
2 Topological aspects 
Step 1 Since Spth(2n) is open in Sp(2n), by Corollary 1.9.4, we can connect M to a 
nearby matrix AI by a path <PI within Spth(2n) such that Al possesses only simple 
eigenvalues. 
By Theorems 1.7.1 and 1.7.2, we obtain a matrix PI E Sp(2n) such that A2 == 
PI-I Al PI = Mlo··· oMm for some integer m E [1, n], where either M E Sp(2) 
is of the normal form (1.7.2), or Mi E Sp(4) is of the normal form (1.7.4). Let 
l; E PI (2n) such that l;(l) = PI and let </Jz(t) = l;(t)-I AIl;(t) for all t E [0,1]. 
Then <P2 is a path in Spth(2n) which connects AI to A2. 
Next we study the Mi s with 1 ::::: i ::::: m according to different types of normal 
forms. 
Step 2 If Mi E Sp(2) is ofthe normal form (1.7.2) with parameters A > ° 
and A :f:. 1, 
thenMi E SP6h(2) = Sp(2)+. By Theorem l,i.e. thepath-connectednessofSp(2)+, 
there is a path ~i in Sp(2)+ which connects Ni to D(2). 
Step3IfMi E Sp(2) is of the form (1.7.2) with the parameter A < OandA:f:. -1,then 
Ni E Sp~h(2) = -Sp(2)+. By Theorem 1, i.e., the path-connectedness of -Sp(2)+, 
there is a path ~i in -Sp(2)+ which connects Ni to D( -2). 
Step 4 If Mi = N2 (Pi, ()i, b) E Sp( 4) is of theform (1.7.4) with parameters Pi E R \ 
{O, ±1}, ()i E (0, rr) U (rr, 2rr), andb E R4. Define '/1 (t) = N2(Pi, (l-t)()i, (l-t)b) 
for ° 
::::: t ::::: 1 via (1.7.4). Then this path 1]1 connects Mi to D(Pi)oD(Pi) within 
Spth(4). 
If Pi > 0, by Step 2 there is a path 1]2 that connects D(Pi) to D(2) within Sp(2)+. 
Then the path ~i == (1/201]2) * 1]1 connects Ni to D(2)oD(2) within Spth(4). 
If Pi < 0, by Step 3 there is a path 1]3 that connects D(Pi) to D( - 2) within Sp(2)+. 
Then the path ~i == (1]301]3) * 1]1 connects Ni to D( -2)oD( -2) within Spth(4). 
Step 5 Define <P3 = ~IO
· ·· o~m. Then the path <P3 connects A2 to a o-product A3 of 
D( -2)s and D(2)s within Spth(2n). By changing the symplectic basis of R 2n , we 
obtain a path <P4 within Spth(2n) that connects A3 to 
A4 = D( -2)0· . . oD( -2)oD(2)0·· ·oD(2). 
Step 6 Define 
y(t) = diag (2R((1- t)rr), ~R((1 - t)rr)) , 
Vt E [0, 1]. 
Then y is a path connecting D( -2)oD( -2) to D(2)oD(2) within Spth(4). Now we 
apply the path y inductively to as many as possible D( -2)oD( -2) components of 
A4. In such a way we obtain a path <P5 : [0, 1] -+ Spth(2n) such that <P5(0) = A4 and 
<P5(1) = {Z~' 
n' 
if a(A4) = 0, 
if a(A4) = 1. 

2.3 Hyperbolic symplectic matrix set 
57 
Define <P = <Ps * ... * <PI. Then <P is a continuous path connecting M to M;; or 
M;; within Spth(2n) according to the value of a(A4). By Lemma 4, the function a 
is constant along the path <p. Thus a(M) = a(A4). This completes the proof of the 
lemma. 
0 
Now we can give 
The proof of Theorem 2: When n = 1, this is Theorem 1. When n 2: 2, by Lemma 5 
the set Spth(2n) possesses at most two path connected components. On the other 
hand, we have 
and 
Thus by Lemma 4, the set Sp th (2n) possesses at least two path connected components, 
and then precisely two. 
For i = 0 or 1, let y : 51 -+ Spfh(2n) be continuous. Now we consider the 
function Pn : Sp(2n) -+ U defined by Lemma 4.3 below. Note that for i = 0 and 1, 
Pn(M) = (_l)i, 
"1M E Spfh(2n). 
Then Pn 0 Y is contractible in 51. Thus y is contractible in Sp(2n) by Lemma 4.7 
below, i.e., Spfh(2n) is simply connected in Sp(2n). The proof is complete. 
D 
Lemma 6 For n 2: 2 and any M E Sph(2n), there exist an N E Sp(2)o and a path 
1 E C([O, 1], Sph(2n) n QO(M» such that 1(0) = M andlor some b = ±1 or 0, 
which is uniquely determined by M,

if a(M) = 1. 
(9) 
(10) 
(11) 
Proof: Since n 2: 2 and M E Sph (2n), by Theorem 1.4.1 there exists a matrix 
p E Sp(2n) such that p-I M P = NoMo for some N E Sp(2)o and some Mo E 
Spth(2n - 2). Let ~ E PI (2n) such that ~(l) = P. Define <PI (t) = ~(t)-I M~(t) for 
all t E [0,1]. Then <PI connects M to NoMo within Sph(2n). By Theorem 2, there 
is a path <P2 : [0,1] -+ Spth(2n - 2) connecting Mo to M:_ I or M;:_l according to 
the value of a(Mo) = a(M) being 0 or 1. Define 1 = (hO<p2) * <PI. Then 1 is the 
path claimed by the lemma. 
D 
By the above proof, the integer b = b(M) in (10) and (11) is uniquely determined 
by M E Sph(2n). Thus the following definition is meaningful and will be used in 
our study of iterations. 
Definition 7 For any ME Sph(2n), the integer pair 
(a(M), b(M» E {O, I} x {-I, 0, 1} 
is called the hyperbolic character of M. 
Now we can give

Proof of Theorem 3: By Lemma 6 and the path connectedness of Sp(2)o, the 
set Sph(2n) possesses at most two path connected components. Since n 2: 2, by 
Lemma 4 and the facts 
we obtain that Sph (2n) possesses at least two and thus precisely two path connected 
components. Using the function Pn : Sp(2n) ~ U defined by Lemma 4.3 below, we 
obtain 
Thus similar to the proof of Theorem 2, Spfh (2n) is simply connected in Sp(2n) for 
i = 0 and 1 by Lemma 4.7 below. The proof is complete.

Note that the simply connectedness in Theorems 2 and 3 are not used in the proofs 
of the following Section 4. 
The following is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.8.10 and Lemma 5. 
Corollary 8 For any M E Sp(2n), there is a path f : [0, 1] ~ nO(M) such that 
f(O) = M and 
(13) 
where each Mi (Wi) is a basic normal form of the eigenvalue Wi E U for 1 :::: i :::: k, 
and the symplectic matrix Mo = Mj or Mj for some non-negative integer j. 
2.4 Structure of regular sets 
In this section, we study the topological structure of the w-regular set Sp(2n)~ for any 
W E U. Note that in Section 1 we have seen that Sp(2)~ with W E U contains precisely 
two path connected components, both of which are simply connected in Sp(2). Here 
we prove that this is also true for the regular set Sp(2n)~ of the symplectic group 
Sp(2n) when n 2: 2. We still omit the subindex W = 1 when there is no confusion. 
Theorem I (C. Conley and E. Zehnder [CoZ2], Y. Long [LonIS)). For W E U, 
the set Sp(2n)~ possesses precisely two path connected components Sp(2n)~ and 
Sp(2n);;; and M;; E Sp(2n)~ and M;; E Sp(2n);;;, where M;!= are defined by (3.7) 
and (3.8). 
Proof: Fix W = 1. Note that Sp(2n)* is open in Sp(2n). By direct computation we 
obtain M;; E Sp(2n)+ and M;; E Sp(2n)-. Thus Sp(2n)* possesses at least two 
path connected components. 
Now fix any M E Sp(2n)*. Next we construct a path f in Sp(2n)* which connects 
M to M;; or M;;. 
Since Sp(2n)* is open in Sp(2n), by Corollary 1.9.4, there is a path fl E C([O, 1], 
Sp(2n)*) such that ft (0) = M and f1 (t) possesses only simple eigenvalues for all

t E (0, 1]. By Theorem 1.7.3 and the path connectedness of Sp(2n) we obtain a path 
12 : [0, 1] ---* Sp(2n)* such that 12(0) = !l (1) and 12(1) is a o-product of normal 
forms of simple eigenvalues according to cr (f2 (1». 
For A = R(a) with a E (0, n:) U (n:, 2n:), or A = D(-a) with a > 0, since 
Sp(2)- is path connected, there is a path connecting A to D( -2) within Sp(2)-. For 
A = D(a) with a E R+ \ {I}, since Sp(2)+ is path connected, we also can connect 
D(a) to D(2) within Sp(2)+. Thus we can connect 12(1) by a path h : [0,1] ---* 
Sp(2n)* to a matrix 13(1) E Spth(2n). Then by Theorem 3.3, we obtain a path f4 in 
Spth(2n) which connects 13(1) to M;t or M;;. This proves that Sp(2n)* possesses 
at most two and thus precisely two path connected components. 
The cases of w = -1 and W E D\R can be studied similarly, and the details are 
left to the readers. The proof is complete. 
D 
Theorem 2 (c. Conley and E. Zehnder [CoZ2], D. Salamon and E. Zehnder 
[SaZ2], Y. Long [LonIS]). For any wED, the set Sp(2n)~ is simply connected in 
Sp(2n). 
We start the proof of this theorem from the following lemmas. 
Lemma 3 For every n EN, there exists afunction Pn E C(Sp(2n), D) such that 
Pn(B- 1 AB) = Pn(A), 
VA, BE Sp(2n), 
(1) 
Pn(AoB) = Pk(A)Ph(B), 
(2) 
VA E Sp(2k), BE Sp(2h), and k + h = n, 
Pn(M) = (_l)a(M), 
if cr(M)nD=0, MESp(2n),

Proof: We carry out the proof in several steps.

Suppose ME Sp(2n) possesses only simple eigenvalues. Then its eigenvalues can 
be arranged in a sequence 
where AI, ... ,An are either Krein-negative eigenvalues of M on D or eigenvalues 
inside the open unit disc in C of M. Denote by argA the argument angle in [0, 2n:) of 
the polar decomposition of the complex number A. Define Arg(M) in R/ (2n: Z) by 
n 
Arg(M) = I: arg(A j) 
j=l 
mod

Pn(M) =exp(.J=!Arg(M)) = n 1/1' 
j=! 
J 
(6) 
Since in fact Arg(M) only depends on Krein-negative eigenvalues on U\R and nega-
tive eigenvalues of M, the map Pn is continuous on symplectic matrices possessing 
simple eigenvalues. 
Next we generalize the definition of Pn to the whole Sp(2n). For any M E Sp(2n), 
suppose A E a(M) n U\{±1} has Krein type (p)..(M), q)..(M)). Denote by 2mo(M) 
the total multiplicity of the eigenvalue -1 of M. We define 
I (
_1)mo(M)+a(M) n 
Aq).(M) 
)..Ea(M)n(U\{±!}) 
, 
Pn(M) = 
if a(M) n (R- U (U\{1))) =1= 10, 
1, 
if a(M) n (R- U (U\{1))) = 10, 
(7) 
where R - is the set of all negative real numbers, and a(M) is the hyperbolic index 
of M defined in Section 1.8. This definition coincides with (6) if M possesses only 
simple eigenvalues. 
Step 2 The continuity of Pn : Sp(2n) ~ U. 
In fact, fix any M E Sp(2n). Let f : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2n) be any path satisfying 
f(O) = M. Then for t > 0 sufficiently small, we consider the possible changes of 
eigenvalues along the path f which may contribute to any change of the value of Pn 
defined in (7). 
If the eigenvalue -1 and nearby negative eigenvalues of M have some exchanges 
when t > 0, then 
mo(f(t)) + a(f(t)) = constant mod 2, 
for t > 0 sufficiently small. 
(8) 
Thus they make no contribution to any change of (7) for small t > O. 
If the eigenvalue -1 and the nearby quadruple eigenvalues in C\ (U U R) of M 
have some exchanges when t > 0, then mo(M) must change by an even integer. Thus 
(8) still holds, and they make no contribution to any change of (7) for small t > O. 
If the eigenvalue -1 and nearby complex conjugate eigenvalues on U \ R of M 
have some exchanges, by our discussion in Section 1.3, then the total multiplicity of 
the changed eigenvalues is even. Thus mo(M) must change by an integer k(t), and at 
the same time there are Krein-negative eigenvalues on U\R sufficiently close to -1 
of f(t) that appear or disappear with total multiplicity k(t) whenever t > 0 is small 
enough. Thus 
( _1)mo(M) 
n 
(9) 
)..Ea(M)n(U\{±!}) 
changes as little as we want if t > 0 is small enough. 

2.4 Structure of regular sets 
61 
If the eigenvalues on U \ R and quadruple eigenvalues in C \ (U U R) of M have 
some exchange, by Theorem 1.3.9 this can happen only for multiples of a quadruple 
of eigenvalues {WI, W2, W3, W4} with WI = W2 = W and W3 = W4 = w in U \ R; WI 
and W3 are Krein positive, W2 and W4 are Krein negative. Thus WI W3 = WW = 1 and 
these exchanges make no contribution to any change of (7). 
If the eigenvalues on U \ R and nearby eigenvalues on U have some exchanges, 
then the corresponding changes of (7) can be required to be as small as we want if 
t > 0 is sufficiently small. 
If the eigenvalue 1 and nearby complex conjugate eigenvalues on U\R of M have 
some exchanges, noting that the eigenvalue 1 has also appeared in the product of (7), 
then the contribution of these exchanges to the change of (7) can be required to be as 
small as we want if t > 0 is sufficiently small. 
If the eigenvalue 1 and the nearby quadruple eigenvalues in C\ (U U R) of M have 
some exchanges, or quadruple eigenvalues in C\ (U U R) of M have some changes, 
these changes make no contribution to any change of (7). 
Thus by the above discussion, for any E > 0, there exists 8 > 0 sufficiently small 
such that whenever N E Sp(2n) and liN - MUC<R2n) :::; 8, we always have 
IPn(N) - Pn(M)1 :::; E. 
(10) 
This proves the continuity of Pn for every n E N. 
Step 3 Basic properties of the maps Pn : Sp(2n) -+ U for n EN. 
In fact, for any A and B E Sp(2n), since B- 1 AB and A possess the same eigen-
values with the same algebraic and geometric multiplicities and the same Krein type 
numbers, we obtain (1). 
By the definition of the {Pn}, we obtain (2) and (3). When eRe and e-Re E 
U\R, by direct computation we obtain that eRe is a Krein-negative and e-Re is 
a Krein-positive eigenvalue of R(B) respectively. Thus by (7) we obtain (4) for this 
case. By the continuity of PI the case of eRe = eRe = ±l follows. 
The proof of Lemma 3 is complete. 
D 
Lemma 4 The map {Pn} with Pn E C(Sp(2n), U) satisfying (1)-(4) of Lemma 3 is 
unique. 
Proof: Suppose ~n E C(Sp(2n), U) are defined for every n E N and also satisfy 
(1)-(4). We need to prove 
~n(M) = Pn(M), 
\1M E Sp(2n). 
(11) 
In fact, fix an M E Sp(2n) and any E > O. By Corollary 1.9.4, there exists a 
sufficiently short path ¢ in Sp(2n) connecting M to a nearby matrix A E Sp(2n) such 
that A possesses only simple eigenvalues and 
l~n(M) -
~n(A)1 :::; E, 
IPn(M) - Pn(A)1 :::; E. 
(12)

Topological aspects 
Here we have used the continuities of both Pn and l;n. Since A possesses only 
simple eigenvalues, a(A) contains only simple complex conjugate eigenvalues on 
U\R, real reciprocal eigenvalues on R\{O, ±1}, and simple quadruple eigenvalues in 
C\(U U R). 
By Theorem 1.7.3, there exists a matrix P E Sp(2n) such that N == p-1 AP = 
Nl <> ... <>Nk is a <>-product of normal form matrices for some 1 :s k :s n, where 
each N; E Sp(2m;) is one of the forms R((}), D(A), and diag(AR((}), A-I R((})) with 
() E U\R and A E R \ {a, ±1}. Thus by (1) and (2) we obtain 
Similarly we have 
l;n(A) = l;n(N) = n l;mi(N;). 
1:s;:sk 
Pn(A) = Pn(N) = n Pmi(N;). 
l:s;:sk 
By (3) and (4), we obtain 
VI :s i :s k. 
Thus by (12)-(15), we obtain 
ll;n(M) - Pn(M)1 :s 2E. 
Since E > ° 
is arbitrary, this proves (11) and the lemma. 
(13) 
(14) 
(15) 
o 
Note that in the above uniqueness proof, we only need (3) to hold for n = I and 2. 
By Lemma 1.1.3, every M E Sp(2n) has its unique polar decomposition M = 
A(M)U(M), where A(M) = (MMT)I/2 is symmetric positive definite and sym-
plectic, U(M) is orthogonal and symplectic. Therefore by Lemma 1.1.5, U(M) has 
the form 
U(M) _ (Ul(M) 
-U2(M)) 
-
u2(M) 
ul(M) 
, 
and u(M) == ul(M) + RU2(M) E U(n, C). 
Lemma 5 The maps {Pn} defined by Lemma 3 further satisfy 
Pn(M) = detu(M), 
VM E Sp(2n) n O(2n), 
-1 
T--
Pn(M 
) = Pn(M ) = Pn(M), 
VM E Sp(2n). 
(16) 
(17) 
(18) 
Proof: Note that det u(M) is the product of all the eigenvalues of u(M) for any 
ME Sp(2n) n O(2n). Therefore (16) follows from Theorem 1.3.10 immediately. 

2.4 Structure of regular sets 
Note that for M E Sp(2n), by J- I MT J 
equality in (18). It also holds that 
(i) a(M) = a(MT) and a(M) = a(MT); 
63 
M - 1 and (1), we obtain the first 
(ii) A E a(M) n (D\R) possesses Krein type (p, q) if and only if I E a(MT) n 
(D\R) possesses Krein type (p , q); 
(iii) if {A, I, A -I, (I)-I} c C\(D\R) form an eigenvalue quadruple for M, they 
are eigenvalues of MT with the same multiplicities. 
From these three facts, we obtain the second equality in (18). The proof is complete.

Remark 6 It holds that

Therefore together with the first two identities in Section 1.7, we obtain that the 
function det u(A) does not satisfy (2) for this matrix A. Consequently (17) does not 
hold for every symplectic matrix in general. 
Lemma 7 The map Pn : Sp(2n) -+ D defined by Lemma 3 induces an isomorphism 
on the fundamental groups 
(19) 
Proof: Note that Sp(2n) n O(2n) is homeomorphic to the unitary group U(n, C) by 
Lemma 1.1.5 and the remarks next to it via the map u : Sp(2n) n O(2n) -+ U(n, C) 
defined by (16). Note also that the determinant map det : U(n, C) -+ C induces 
an isomorphism det* : Jrl (U(n, C)) -+ Jrl (D) by the exact homotopy sequence (cf. 
[Spa 1]) 
0= Jr](SU(n, C)) -+ JrI(U(n, C))~JrI(D) -+ Jro(SU(n, C)) = o. 
Therefore by Lemma 5 the map Pn induces an isomorphism 
(Pn)* : Jrl (Sp(2n)) n O(2n)) -+ Jr] (D). 
(20) 
Since by (2.4), the quotient space Sp(2n) / (Sp(2n)) n 0 (2n)) is contractible, (19) 
holds by properties of Pn. 
D 
Now we can give 
The proof of Theorem 2: We distinguish three cases according to the value of (j). 
Case 1 (j) = 1. 
The proof is carried out in two steps. We still omit the subindex (j) = 1.

Topological aspects 
Step 1 An alternative definition of Pn on Sp(2n)*. 
In this step, we shall define functions bi E C (Sp(2n)*, [0, 2:rr]) for 1 :s i :s n such 
that for any ME Sp(2n)*, 
Pn(M) = exp! 
H~bi(M) I· 
(21) 
Let R + be the set of all positive real numbers. Fix an M E Sp(2n)*. We pick up 
n eigenvalues of M by 
(22) 
where ai for 1 :s i :s n - k denote all the eigenvalues of M in (0, 1), and Ai for 
1 :s i :s k are chosen in the following way: 
If A E U has Krein type (p, q), we define Ai = A for q times. 
If A E C\R+ and IAI < 1 has multiplicity m, we define Ai = A for m times. 
By Theorem 1.3.1 and Lemma 1.3.8, the total number of Ai s we have defined must 
bek. 
We construct the bi (M)s as follows. 
(A) For each Ai in A, we choose a real number bi (M) for 1 :s i :s k such that 
O:s bi(M):s 2:rr, 
A" 
exp{Hbi(M)} = -' . 
lAd 
Note that these bi (M)s are uniquely determined in such a way. 
Then we define bi (M) according to ai. 
(23) 
(24) 
(B) If det(M - l) > 0, by Theorem 1.3.1 there must hold n - k = 2m! for 
some integer m! ~ O. We define bi (M) = 0 and bi (M) = 2:rr for m I times 
respectively. 
(C) If det(M - l) < 0, by Theorem 1.3.1 there must hold n - k = 2m! + 1 for 
some integer m I ~ O. We define bi (M) = 0 for m 1+ 1 times and bi (M) = 2:rr 
for m I times. 
Note that by Theorems 1.3.1, 1.3.9 and 1.9.5, we have defined n of the bi (M)s and 
they are continuous on Sp(2n)*. 
Note that any A and I E a(M) n (C\R) with IAI < 1 only contribute 1 on the 
right-hand side of (21). Thus by Theorem 1.3.1 and the definition of bi(M), the 
function defined on Sp(2n)* by the right-hand side of(21) in the above way coincides 
with the function Pn defined by (7). This coincidence can also be verified by the 
uniqueness in Lemma 4. 

2.4 Structure of regular sets 
65 
Step 2 For r > 0 let y : S, == R/(rZ) ---+ Sp(2n)* be a continuous closed curve in 
Sp(2n)*. Then Pn 0 Y : S, ---+ U is a continuous cycle on U. Using the functions 
bi(y(t)) for 1 SiS n we define 
n 
~y(t) = I)i(y(t)), 
'10 S t S r, 
(25) 
i=l 
(26) 
Note that each bi 0 y : S, ---+ [0, 2n] is contractible, and then by 
Pn 0 yet) = exp(r-I~y(t)), 
Pn 0 Y : S, ---+ U is contractible too. Then by Lemma 7, the loop y is contractible in 
Sp(2n). 
Thus Sp(2n)* is simply connected in Sp(2n). 
Case2w =-1 
In this case, we have D-l (M) = Dl (-M). Thus the map M f-+ -M gives a 
homeomorphism from Sp(2n r: 1 to Sp(2n)f. Then the case of w = -1 follows from 
thatofw=l. 
Case 3 w E U\R. 
Let 8 E (0, n) U (n, 2n) such that w = eR"l!. Similar to Case 1, we can construct 
functions bi E C(Sp(2n)~, R) for 1 SiS n such that for any M E Sp(2n)~, 
biCM) E [8, 2n + 8], 
(27) 
(28) 
The details of this definition are left to the readers. Now similarly to Case 1, for 
any loop y : Sl ---+ 
Sp(2n)~, by (28) and properties of bi(M), we obtain that 
Pn 0 Y : Sl ---+ U is contractible in U. Then by Lemma 7, the loop y is contractible 
in Sp(2n). 
The proof is complete. 
Corollary 8 (D. Salamon and E. Zehnder [SaZ2]). For any r > 0, w E U, and 
M E Sp(2n)~, let y : [0, r] ---+ Sp(2n)~ be a continuous path satisfying yeO) = M 
and y(r) = M;; or M;. Then 
(29) 

66

Topological aspects 
Proof: We only prove the case of w = 1. Other cases are similar. 
When n = 1, the estimate (29) follows from Figures 1.1 and 1.2 immediately. 
When n ::: 2, by our above definitions for bi (M) in the proof of Theorem 2, we 
obtain

i=1 
Thus (29) holds. 
o 
Next we study a subset Sp(2n )** of the regular set of Sp(2n) defined by: 
Sp(2n)** = {M E Sp(2n)j I A E a(M) n U implies A = -l}. 
(30) 
Proposition 9 1 ° Sp(2n)* can be defonned into Sp(2n)** for n ::: l. 
2° Sp(2)** is a strong defonnation retract ofSp(2)*. 
3° Sp(2n)** is not a defonnation retract ofSp(2n)* ifn ::: 2. 
Proof: 2° follows from the study of Sp(2) in Section 2.1. Assume 3° does not hold, 
we prove it indirectly. By definition there exists 8 E C(Sp(2n)* x [0, 1], Sp(2n)*) 
such that 
8(M,0) = M , 
8(M, 1) E Sp(2n)**, 
"1M E Sp(2n)*, 
(31) 
8(M, 1) = M, 
"1M E Sp(2n)**.

Since n ::: 2, for p E [1, 2] we can define

(33) 
Then we have 
a(Mp) = {-I, p.J=l, p-I.J=l, -P.J=l, -p-I.J=l}' 
where -1 has its mUltiplicity (2n - 4). For 1 < p :s 2, we have Mp E Sp(2n)**, 
and then by (33) we obtain 8(Mp, 1) = Mp and a(8(Mp, 1)) = a(Mp). Thus by the 
continuities of 8 and a(Mp) in p E [1,2], 
a(8(MI, 1)) 
lim

This contradicts (31) and (30) and completes the proof of 3°. 
We leave the proof of 1 ° to the readers.

2.5 Structure of singular sets 
67 
Remark 10 Theorem 1 on the path connected property of Sp(2n)t was proved by 
C. Conley and E. Zehnder in [CoZ2] of 1984 for the case of n 2: 2. The case of n = 1 
follows from the R3-cylindrical coordinate representation immediately. 
Theorem 2 on the simply connectedness of Sp(2n)1' in Sp(2n) was formulated by 
C. Conley and E. Zehnder in [CoZ2] of 1984 for the case of n 2: 2. Proposition 9 was 
proved by the author in 1988 during his visitto ETH-Ziirich, and was put into [LonI5] 
which was published later in 1999. It shows that Lemma 1.4 of [CoZ2] is incorrect and 
therefore the proof of Theorem 2 for the simply connectedness of Sp(2n)i in Sp(2n) 
given in [CoZ2] is not complete. The complete proof of Theorem 2 for Sp(2n)1' was 
given by D. Salamon and E. Zehnder in [SaZI] and [SaZ2] in 1990-1992, in which 
the function Pn (M) of (7) was defined. Corollary 8 was proved in [SaZ2]. 
Theorems 1 and 2 for OJ E U \ {I} were proved in [Lon 15] of 1999. 
2.5 Structure of singular sets 
In this section we study the topological structure of the singular set Sp(2n)~ in Sp(2n) 
for OJ E U. When n = 1, this is completely clear by our R3-cylindrical coordinate 
representation of Sp(2)~. But when n 2: 2, the structure becomes rather complicated. 
Our study is realized via normal forms introduced in Chapter 1. Note that in this 
section we are working in the field R. 
Theorem 1 Sp(2n)? and Sp(2n)~ 1 are path connected respectively. For OJ E U \ R, 
the set Sp(2)~ has precisely two path connected components, and the set Sp(2n)~ is 
path connected if n 2: 2. 
Proof: Let M E Sp(2n)~. By Theorem 1.9.3, there is a path f : [0,1] --+ Sp(2n)? 
and an integer k E [1, n] such that f(O) = M and 
(1) 
where Mo E Sp(2ko) for some ko 2: 0 and OJ rf- cr(Mo), and each Mi for 1 :s i :s k 
is a basic normal form matrix for the eigenvalue OJ. 
When OJ = 1, each M; E Sp(2) in (1) has the form Nl (1, bi) with bi = ±I or 0 
for 1 :s i :s k. Connecting each Mi to h within Sp(2)? and Mo to hko in Sp(2ko), 
we obtain the path connectedness of ME Sp(2n)? 
When OJ = -1, since M f-+ - M yields a homeomorphism between Sp(2n)? and 
Sp(2n)~ l' the later one is also path connected. 
When OJ E U\R and n = 1, the conclusion follows from the R3-cylindrical 
coordinate representation of Sp(2). 
When OJ E U\R and n 2: 2, by our study in Case 4 before Definition 1.8.9, we can 
connect the basic normal form N2(OJ, b) or N2(W, b) to N2(OJ, 0) or N2(W, 0) within 
Sp(2n)~. Then we connect N2(OJ, 0) or N2(W, 0) to R(e)<>R(-e) within Sp(2n)~ 
where OJ = eRe. Therefore we may assume every Mi in (1) is of the form R(e)

or R( -(}). Keep one of the R«(})s and R( -(})s fixed, and connect all the other Mj 
and Mo to the identity matrices respectively. Then M has been connected to R«(})<:>I 
or R( -(})<:>/ within Sp(2n)~. Then within Sp(2n)~ we can connect R( -(})<:>I to 
R( -(})<:>R«(})<:>hn-4, then to R«(})<:>R«(})<:>hn-4, and finally to R(B)<:>I. Thus Sp(2n)~ 
is path connected if n :::: 2.

By the definition of M~(2n) in Section 1.8, we have M~(2n) = Sp(2n)~, which is 
simply connected in Sp(2n) by Theorem 4.2. Note that Min (2n) = {hn} is certainly 
simply connected. 
By our discussion in Section 1, the set Mw(2) possesses precisely two path con-
nected components Sp(2)~,+ and Sp(2)~,_, each of which is simply connected in 
Sp(2) for (J) E D, but is not simply connected in itself if (J) = 1 or -1. 
Proposition 2 When n :::: 2 and (J) E D, the singular hypersuiface Sp(2n)~ is not 
simply connected in Sp(2n). Thus it is also not simply connected in itself. 
Proof: Let eRe = (J) E D. Define 
f(t) = hn-4<:>R(B)<:>R(2trr), 
Then the function ~l defined by (4.25) satisfies ~l(f) = 2rr and f(t) E Sp(2n)~ 
for all t E [0, 1]. Thus Sp(2n)~ with n :::: 2 is not simply connected in Sp(2n), and 
is not simply connected in itself.

Proposition 3 10 The conjugacy class [M] in Sp(2n) is path connected in itself for 
any M E Sp(2n). 
20 The homotopy component nO(M) and thus the conjugacy class [M] is simply 
connected in Sp(2n) for any M E Sp(2n). 
Proof: 10 The path connectedness of [M] follows from the normal form results in 
Chapter 1. 
20 Fix M E Sp(2n). Let y : [0, 1]/{0, I} -+ nO(M) be a continuous loop. By 
the definition of nO(M), any N E nO(M) satisfies a(N) n D = a(M) n U. 
Thus by the definition of the function Pn : Sp(2n) -+ D via (4.7), it must hold 
that 
key) == #{Pn(y(t) It E [0, I]} < +00. 
By Lemma 4.3, the function Pn is continuous. Thus k(y) = 1, i.e., y is contractible 
in Sp(2n). 
0 
Note that in Proposition 3, if M E Sp(2n)~, the conclusion is a consequence of 
Theorem 4.2. 
Note that the structure of Sp(2n)~ 1 is similar to that of Sp(2n)? The details are 
left to the readers. When (J) E D\R, the set Sp(2)~ possesses two path connected 
components and Sp(2n)~ is path connected when n :::: 2.

Remark 4 The above results in this section are based on the ideas and results in 
[Lon6] of 1991, [LonI3] of 1997, and [LonlS] of 1999. 
In [LZu2], the following further results on the differentiable structures of M~ (2n) 
for 1 :s k :s 2n defined in Section 1.6 were studied. The following results were 
proved based upon the ideas of v.1. Arnold in [AmI] and of our study on the normal 
forms. These results form the basis for the intersection number definition of the 
index theory for symplectic paths. We shall not use them in this book, and refer the 
interested readers to [LZu2] of C. Zhu and the author for detailed proofs. 
Theorem 5 (cf. Theorem 1.1 of [LZu2]). For every 0 :s k :s 2n, Mll (2n) is 
a codimension k(kil) smooth submanifold of Sp(2n), and 1t It=o (Melt), with 
ME M±l (2n),forms a transverse structure of M±l (2n) in Sp(2n). Moreover, 
Mll (2n) = U Mtl (2n).

Theorem 6 (cf. Theorem 1.2 of [LZu2]). For any (V E U\R, the set Mw(2n) is a 
codimension 1 smooth submanifold of Sp(2n), and 1t It=o (Melt), with M E 
Mw(2n), forms a transverse structure of Mw(2n) in Sp(2n). Moreover, UI?:.kM~ (2n) 
is a codimension k2 real algebraic subvariety of Sp(2n) for every 0 :s k :s n, and is 
an empty set for n < k :s 2n.

In this section we study the topological structure of Sp(2n) near Sp(2n)~ and 
Mw(2n) for (V E U defined in Section 1.8, especially the transversality ofrotation 
paths with respect to Sp(2n)~. When n = 1, this follows from our discussion in 
Section 1 via the R3 -cylindrical coordinate representation of Sp(2)~. But when 
n :::: 2, the structure becomes rather complicated. We use the normal forms introduced 
in Chapter 1, together with the discussion of the changes of dimension of the null

space and the function Dw(M) for any M E Sp(2n)~ under the continuous actions of 
rotation matrices Rk (e). Our main results in this section are the following Theorems 1 
to 6. Note that in this section we are working in the field C. 
Theorem 1 For wE U and M E Mw(2n), there exist an integer k, 1 :s k :s n, and 
a small real number eo > 0 such that 
if 0 < lei :s eo· 
(4) 
Theorem 2 For n 2: 2 and wE U, suppose M E Mw(2n), and there exist integers 
kl' k2, 1 :s kl < k2 :s n, and a real number eo > 0 such that 
Then 
Dw(M Rki (e))Dw(M Rki (-e)) < 0, 
Dw(M Rkl (e))Dw(M Rk2 (e)) > 0, 
for 0 < Ie I :s eo, 
for 0 < Ie I :s eo. 
(6) 
(7) 
Theorem 3 Suppose wE U, M E Sp(2n)~, and there exists P E Sp(2n) such that 
PMP- 1 = HooMo == N, 
(8) 
with Ho E Sp(2h)~ being a normal form of the eigenvalue w for some integer h E 
[1, n] and Mo E Sp(2(n - h»';.,. Suppose 
vw(M) - vw(M p- 1 Rl (e)p) = 2, 
for 0 < lei :s eo, 
(9) 
with some small eo > O. Then h = I and Ho = ±/z if w = ±1, or h = 2 and 
Ho = N2(cp, b) E M~(4) with cp = w or (ij if w E U\R In particular 
if and only if 
e = 0 mod 2](. 
(10) 
Note that Sp(2n)';., contains precisely two path connected components Sp(2n)t 
and Sp(2n) ~. The conclusion (6) of Theorem 2 points out that under the condition 
there, M Rki (e) and M Rki (-e) belong to different path connected components of 
Sp(2n)';., for 0 < e :s eo. The conclusion (7) of Theorem 2 points out that under the 
condition there, M Rkl (e) and M Rk2 (e) belong to the same path connected component 
of Sp(2n)';., for 0 < lei :s eo. Theorem 3 points out that under conditions there 
M p- 1 Rk(e)p belongs to the same path connected component of Sp(2n)';., for 0 < 
e < 2](. 
The above results describe the topological structures near the singular hypersurface 
Sp(2n)o, as we shall see in the next section and in later chapters. We start the proofs 
of these theorems from the following study on the rotation matrices. 
Proposition 4 For any w E U, M E Sp(2n)~, integer k with 1 :s k :s nand e E R,

2.6 Transversality of rotation paths

Proof: We only consider the case co = I and work in the field R. Other cases 
are left to the readers. Let m = dim ker (M - l). If m :S 2, then (11) already 
holds. So we suppose m 2: 3 and that {al, . . . , am} is a base of ker(M - l). Fix 
k E {I, ... , n}. Without loss of generality we may suppose thatthe k-th and (n +k)-th 
components of ai are all zero for 3 :S i :S m. Therefore for 3 :S i :S m we have 
(MRk(e) -l)ai = (M -I)ai = 0, hence dimker(MRk(e) -I) 2: m - 2. This 
completes the proof. 
0 
Note that {M E Sp(2n)~ I v",(M) > m} is a closed subset in Sp(2n)~ for any 
m 2: O. Therefore when lei is sufficiently small, the left-hand side of (11) is always 
non-negative for any integer k E [1, n]. 
In the following, we only prove Theorems 1 and 2 for co = 1 and work in the 
field R. Proofs for other cases are similar and are left to the readers. 
Proof of Theorem 1: Fix M E M (2n). It suffices to prove the existence of an integer 
k E [1, n] and eo > 0 such that 
(12) 
Let {ai, ... , am} C R2n be a cyclic base of a maximal cyclic space V of M 
belonging to the eigenvalue 1, i.e., they form a base of V and satisfy (M -l)ak = ak-l 
for 1 :S k :S m and ao = O. Here m E [1, n] and without loss of generality we assume 
(13) 
We choose an invariant base {dl, .. . , dp } of the root vector subspace W of M 
belonging to eigenvalues other than 1 with p = 2n - 2m, so that ei = (M -I)di E W 
for 1 :S i :S p. Then {al, ... , am, dl, ... , dp } form a base of R2n. Denote by 
A = (ai, . .. , am), A 1 = (a2, ... , am), Am = (a], . .. , am-l), D = (d], . . . , dp), 
and E = (e I, ... , e p) the matrices formed by the corresponding column vectors. 
Here we further assume 
det(A, D) = 1. 
(14) 
Then 
rank (Am , E) = 2n - 1. 
(15) 
In fact, if column vectors of (Am, E) were linearly dependent, a non-trivial linear 
combination of column vectors of (A l, D) would belong to ker( M - I). Then this 
contradicts M E M(2n). The column vectors of (Am, E) are also symplectically 
orthogonal to al, i.e., 
af Jx = 0, 
v x EX = span {column vectors of (Am, E)}. 
(16) 
This follows from the symplectic orthogonality between V and Wand the fact that 
ME Sp(2n).

Write al = (al,l, . . . , a2n,J)T E R2n and other vectors similarly. Without loss of 
generality by (13) we assume that

By (17) and (l8), the (n+ 1)-strow vectorofthe2n x (2n-l) matrix (Am , E) is a linear 
combination of the other row vectors of (Am, E). Let H be the (2n - 1) x (2n - 1) 
matrix obtained from (Am, E) by cancelling its (n + 1)-st row. Then by (17) we 
obtain 
det H f. O. 
(19) 
From (M RI (a) - I)RI (-a) = (M - I) + (I - RI (-a)) we obtain 
(MRI(a) -I)RI(-a)(al, AI, D) 
(20) 
= ((1- RI(-a))al, Am, E) + (1- RI(-a))(O, AI, D). 
Thus for sufficiently small la I we obtain 
DI (M RI (a)) 
= (_I)n-1 det[(M RI (a) - I)RI (-a)(al , AI, D)] 
= (_1)n-1 {det[((1 - RI (-a))al, Am, E)] + o(la I)}

= (sin a)[(lal,lI2 + lan+l , I12)C + 0(1)], 
where f(a) = o(lalk) if lima ..... o If(a)I/lalk = 0 for k = 0 or 1, and C = 
-(det H)/al,l . To get the third equality in (21), we have added -an+i,J/al ,1 times 
the i-th row and ai,l/al,l times the (n + i)-th row of the determinant in (21) to 
its (n + 1)-st row, and used the above definiton of H. From (17), (19), and (21), 
Theorem 1 follows. 
Proof of Theorem 2: By the assumption of Theorem 2, 
Without loss of generality, we assume ak} ,1 f. O. Similar to (21) we obtain 
DI (M Rk} (a))DI (M Rkl (-a)) 
= -(sina)2[(lakl ,I12 + lan+k},I12)2C2 + 0(1)] 
< 0,

for lal > 0 sufficiently small and some G i- O. This proves (6). Similarly we also 
obtain 
Dw(M Rkl (a))Dw(M Rk2 (a)) 
= (sina)2[(lakl ,112 + lan+kl,112)(lak2,tl2 + lan+k2,112)G2 + 0(1)] 
> 0, 
for lal > 0 sufficiently small and the same G i- O. This proves (7). 
The proof of Theorem 3: Fix M E Sp(2n)? (or Sp(2n)~1)' By the definition of 
the normal forms in Section 1.4 (or 1.5), the condition (9) implies Ho = h (or -h)· 
Thus by a direct computation we obtain (10). When M E Sp(2n)~ for W E U\R, 
the result follows from the normal forms in Section 1.6 and Lemma 1.9.2. 
Remark 5 Results in this section were proved in [Lon13] and [LonI5]. 
2.7 
Orientability of Mw(2n) in Sp(2n) 
In this section, we study the structure near Mw (2n) for W E U defined in Section 1.8 
by reducing the study near any M E Mw(2n) to that near a matrix in the o-product 
Sp(2)~oSp(2n -
2)~. 
Theorem 1 For any W = e8R E U and M E Mw(2n), by Theorem 1.7.3 there 
exists P E Sp(2n) such that 
(1) 
where Nk(W, b) E Mw(2k) is a normalform of the eigenvalue W with W = W orw, 
and Ml E Sp(2n -
2k)~. Then there exist Mo E Sp(2n -
2)~ and a continuous path 
a : [0, 1] -+ Mw(2n) such that 
a(O) = M, 
0'(1) = Nl (w, b )oMo, 
(2) 
where w = ±1 and b E {I, -I} if W = ±l, w = W or wand b = 0 if W E U\R 
Moreover for any sufficiently small a > 0, there exist continuous paths a± : [0, 1] -+ 
Sp(2n)~ such that 
0'-(0) = MP-1R1(-a)P, 
0'+(0) = M p-1 R1 (a)P, 
0'-(1) = [Nl(W, b)R(-a)]oMo, 
0'+(1) = [N1 (w, b)R(a)]oMo, 
(3) 
(4) 
and (N1 (w, b)¢8o(t))oMo E Sp(2n)* for all t E [-1, 1]\{0}, where ¢8o(t) is defined 
by 
V t E [0, 1]. 
(5) 
Furthermore, the distance between paths a± and a is not greater than twice that of 
Nand N R1 (a).

Topological aspects 
From now on, we fix w = 1 and only carry out the proof for this case. We still omit 
the subindex w = 1 in notations. Other cases can be proved similarly and therefore 
are left to the readers. To prove Theorem 1, we need the following basic lemma. 
Lemma 2 Let q : [0,1] -+ M(2n) be a continuous curve. Fix small eo > ° 
sufficiently close to ° 
so that for all s E [0, 1] and Ie I :s eo the matrix 
Q(I(s) == q(s)Rm(s) (e) 
(6) 
satisfies Q(I(s) E Sp(2n)* for ° < lei :s eo and s E [0,1], and m(s) E [1, n] is 
the least positive integer which has this property. The existence of m (s) is given by 
Theorem 6.1. Then there exist two path connected sets Q+ and Q- such that 
{Q(I(s) 10:s s:s 1, 0< ±e:s eo} c Q± C Sp(2n)*. 
(7) 
Furthermore, Q+ and Q- belong to different path connected components ofSp(2n)*, 
and we can choose two continuous curves in f± : [0, 1] -+ Q± so that f±(s) is as 
close to q (s) as we want. 
Proof: We first construct Q+ in several steps. 
Step 1 Note that for fixed s E [0, 1], the set 
G(s) == {Q(I(s) 10 < e :s eo} 
defines a continuous curve in Sp(2n) * . 
Next we fix a e E (0, eo] and define an auxiliary set Q (e) in the following Steps 2 
to 5. 
Step 2 In general the map Q(I : [0, 1] -+ Sp(2n)* may not be continuous. Suppose 
there are k integers A(e) == {mj, ... , mk} appearing in (6) as m(s) for all s E [0,1] 
satisfying 1 :s mj < ... < mk :s n for some k E [1, n]. 
If k = 1, the map Q(I is continuous and we define Q(e) = Q(I([O, 1]), which is 
path connected. 
Suppose k > 1. Then the map Q(I is not continuous. We construct Q (e) as follows. 
Step 3 Suppose VI (q (so) Rmj (a)) = ° 
for some So E [0, 1] and any ° 
< a :s e. 
Without loss of generality we assume mi = 1 here. For fixed a E (0, e], by the effect 
of the rotation matrix RI (a), there exists an open subinterval neighborhood N(a) of 
So in [0, 1] depending on a such that 
det(q(s)Rj (a) - l) 1= 0, 
Vs E N(a). 
By the computation formula (6.21) for the effect of RI (a), 
det(q(s)RI(a) - I) = (_I)n sina[(l + a~+I,1 (s))b(s) + 0(1)], 
(8) 

2.70rientability of Mw(2n) in Sp(2n) 
75 
where by the continuity of q, both an+ 1,1 (s) and b(s) are real continuous functions 
in s, independent of ex, and b(so) i= O. The term 0(1) is defined as lima---+o 0(1) = O. 
Thus we can further require e E (0, eo] to be sufficiently small so that there exists an 
open subinterval neighborhood N of So in [0, l]satisfyingN C n{N(ex) 10 < ex:::: e}. 
Thus we have proved the existence of an open subinterval neighborhood N of So in 
[0, 1] such that 
'<Is EN, 0 < ex :::: e. 
(9) 
Thus for each mi E A(e) the set {s E [0,1] 1 Qe(s) = q(s)Rmi(e)} is a union of 
subintervals {Ni,} }}EEi in [0, 1] with some subindex set Ei. Denote by Ni~} the 
interior of Ni,j in [0, 1]. Note that some Ni,} may contain only one point. The 
unit interval [0, 1] is a disjoint union of all these subintervals Ni,j for j E Ei and 
i = 1, ... , k. 
Step 4 Let So be a discontinuous point of Qe. By the definition (6), we suppose 
Qe(so) = q(so)Rmi(e) for some mi E A(e). By the continuous effect of Rmi(ex) 
for 0 < ex :::: e on q(s) with s near So given by (9) and the openness of Sp(2n)* in 
Sp(2n), we obtain a small open interval neighborhood B(so) of So in [0, 1] such that 
'<Is E B(so), 0 < ex :::: e. 
For any s E B(so), by definition Qe(s) = q(s)Rm(s)(e) for some m(s) E A(e). If 
m(s) i= mi, by Theorem 6.2, there exists a continuous curve CfJe,s : [0, 1] -+ Sp(2n)* 
such that CfJe,s(O) = q(s)Rm;(e) and CfJe,s(1) = q(s)Rm(s)(e). If m(s) = mi, define 
CfJe,s([O, 1]) = Qe(s). Define 
Fe(B(so)) = U{CfJe,s([O, 1]) 1 s E B(so)}· 
Then Fe (B(so)) is a path connected subset of Sp(2n)* containing the non-path con-
nected set Qe (B(so)) and the path connected set {q (s )Rmi (e) 1 s E B(so)}· 
The set Fe (B(so)) is shown in Figure 3 by thick black curves with m(s) < mi = 
meso) and s E B(so). 
Step 5 Define F to be the family of open subintervals of [0, 1] which consists of B(s) 
for all discontinuity point s of Qe and N° . for all j E Ei and i = 1, ... , k. Then 
t,J 
F is an open covering of [0, 1]. Thus F possesses a finite subcovering F1 of [0, 1]. 
Define the set Q(e) to be the union of the sets 
U{Fe(B(s)) 1 B(s) E FI, S E [0, In 
and 
Then by our construction in Step 4, the set Q (e) is path connected.

Step 6 Fix a 8 E (0,80] such that (9) holds. Using the set Q (8) constructed in Step 2 
or 3-5, and the set G(s) defined in (A), we define 
Q+ = (U{G(s) Is E [0, 1m U Q(8). 
Then Q+ is path connected and satisfies (7). 
By a similar proof we obtain the path connected set Q- satisfying (7). 
That Q+ and Q- belong to different path connected components follows from 
Theorem 6.2. The last conclusion of Lemma 2 follows from our construction

With the aid of Lemma 2, we now give 
Proof of Theorem 1 for w = 1: By our discussion in Section 1, it suffices to study the 
caseforn::::: 2. FixM E M(2n) and assume that (1) holds. By our study in Section 3, 
we obtain a path f : [0, 1] ~ M(2n) such that f(O) = N, f(l) = Nl (1, b)oMo 
for some Nl (1, b) E Sp(2)0 with b = 1 or -1 and a matrix Mo E Sp(2n - 2)*. By 
Lemma 2, we obtain two paths f± : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2n)* such that 
f±(l) = [Nl (1, b)R(±8)]oMo, 
and the distance between f± and f is not greater than twice the distance between 
Nand N Rl (8). For P defined in (1), choose p E C([O, 1], Sp(2n)) such that 
p(O) = P and p(1) = I. Define 
p(t)-l f(t)p(t), 
V t E [0, 1], 
p(t)-l f±(t)p(t), 
V t E [0, 1]. 
Then these three paths satisfy the requirements of the theorem and complete the proof.

Theorem 3 For any (J) E U, the regular part M", (2n) of the singular hypersurface 
Sp(2n)~ in Sp(2n) possesses a natural orientation. 
Proof: Since M",(2n) is a smooth codimension 1 open submanifold in Sp(2n), it 
is two-sided locally near any M E M",(2n). Fix M E M",(2n). By Theorem 6.1, 
there exists an integer k E [1, n] such that (6.4) holds. We can define the positive 
normal direction to be the direction of the unit normal vector v(M",(2n), M) of 
M",(2n) at M such that Ev(M",(2n), M) with sufficiently small E > 0 points to the 
path connected component of Sp(2n): which contains M Rk(()) for sufficiently small 
() > O. By Theorems 1 and 6.2, this orientation is globally well defined.

Part II 
The Variational Method 
In his pioneering work [Rab2] in 1978, P. Rabinowitz proved the existence of periodic 
solutions of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems via variational methods. Since then, a 
large number of research papers have appeared in this area. Our goal in Part II is 
mainly to introduce the variational structure of Hamiltonian systems and two most 
popular finite dimensional reduction methods in the study of periodic solutions for 
Hamiltonian systems: the saddle point reduction method and the Galerkin approxi-
mation method.

3 Hamiltonian systems and canonical transfonnations 
Let p = q and x = (p T , q T) T. To simplify the notation, in the remainder of this 
book, when there is no confusion, we shall simply write x = (p, q) E R2n in this 
case. Let H(t, x) be the energy function of the system (1) defined by 
1 
2 
H(t, x) = llpl + V(t, q). 
Then the system (1) reduces to a special case of the differential equation system 
x = lH'(t,x), 
(2) 
where x E R2n, H'(t, x) denotes the gradient of H with respect to the variable 
x, 1 is the standard symplectic matrix defined in Section 1.1. In general we let 
H : R x R2n --+ R be a smooth function. In this book usually we require H to be at 
least C2. Any ordinary differential equation system which is of the form (2) is called 
a Hamiltonian system. H is called the energy function and also the Hamiltonian 
function of (2). When the Hamiltonian function H is independent of the time variable 
t, the system (2) becomes an autonomous system of the form 
x = lH'(x). 
(3) 
If we apply an arbitrary coordinate transformation to the system (3), in general, this 
will change the form of the differential equation system. We want to find a class of 
transformations such that they transform Hamiltonian systems into other Hamiltonian 
systems, i.e., the so called canonical transformations. 
Rewrite the system (2) in the form 
x = lHx(x). 
(4) 
Here we denote by Hx the gradient of H with respect to the variable x. Let x = u (w) 
be a coordinate transformation. Define 
K(w) = H(u(w)). 
Thenx = uww, where Uw denotes the gradient matrix ofu with respect to the variable 
w, and 
Thus (4) becomes 
If we require 
(5) 
then via this transformation, the system (4) still becomes a Hamiltonian system, 
W = lKw(w). 
(6) 

3.1 Canonical transformations 
83 
Clearly, the condition (5) requires the derivative of the transformation x = u (w) to 
be a symplectic matrix at every point. 
Definition 1 If a diffeomorphism x = u(w) satisfies (5), it is called a canonical 
transformation, or a symplectomorphism. 
Clearly, canonical transformations form a group. By the condition (5), linear 
canonical transformations have the form x = M w, where M E Sp(2n). 
In order to further study the properties of the canonical transformations, denote 
by x = (p, q) E R 2n, i.e., Xi = Pi and Xn+i = qi for i = 1, ... , n. We consider 
the standard symplectic space (R2n, w), where w is the standard symplectic form on 
R 2n. By the notation of the exterior differentiations, w has the representation 
w= 1 
"2Jdx /\ dx 
1 n 
"2 L(dpi /\ dqi - dqi /\ dpi) 
i=1 
n 
Ldp; /\dq;. 
i=1 
Given a differentiable map u : w f-+ x = u(w), the pull-back map u* induced by u 
yields a new differentiable 2-form, 
u*w(w) = 1 
"2Jdu(w) /\ du(w) 
1 
"2Juwdw /\ uwdw 
1 
T 
-(uw) Juwdw /\ dw. 
2 
From this we immediately obtain that x = u(w) is a canonical transformation if and 
only if 
u*w=w. 
(7) 
Consider the ordinary differential equation system defined on the space R 2n, 
x = f(x), 
(8) 
where f : R2n -+ R2n is a smooth map. Denote by q/(x) the flow on R2n defined 
by (8), i.e., the solution map of (8) satisfying the initial value condition ¢o (x) = x. 
The following theorem further discusses the relation between Hamiltonian systems 
and canonical transformations. 
Theorem 2 The differential equation system (8) defined on R2n is a Hamiltonian 
system, if and only if the flow ¢t (x) defined by (8) is canonical at every time t. 

84 
3 
Hamiltonian systems and canonical transformations 
Proof: Denote the Jacobian matrix of qi (x) by <I> (t, x) = ¢~ (x). By (8), it satisfies 
d 
t 
-<I>(t, x) = (f(¢ (x)))x = F(t, x)<I>(t, x), 
dt 
where F(t, x) = fx(¢t(x)). We then obtain 
!!..- (<I>T 1 <1» = <l>T (-(1 F)T + 1 F) <1>. 
dt 
(9) 
Necessity. If (8) is a Hamiltonian system, then there exists a Hamiltonian function 
H : R 2n -+ R such that f = 1 Hx. Thus F = 1 Hxx. By the symmetry of the 
Hessian matrix Hxx, the right-hand side of (9) is zero, Le., <l>T 1 <I> is independent of 
t. When t = 0 it equals 1. Thus <I> is symplectic. This proves that ¢t is canonical. 
Sufficiency. Suppose ¢t is canonical. Thus <I> is symplectic. Let g(x) = -1 f(x). 
Then 
gx(¢t(x)) = -1fx(¢t(x)) = -1F(t,x). 
Since <I> is symplectic, (9) yields 
0= !!..-(<I>T 1<1» = <l>T(-(JF)T + 1F)<I>. 
dt 
Therefore gx (¢t (x)) is a symmetric matrix. Especially at the time t = 0 we obtain 
gi,xj (x) = g},Xi (x), 
Since R 2n itself is open and convex, by the calculus of several variables there exists 
a function H : R2n -+ R such that g(x) = Hx(x). Thus f = 1 g = 1 Hx, i.e., (8) is 
a Hamiltonian system. 
The proof is complete. 
D 
Remark 3 If we discuss this problem on a subdomain of R2n or a manifold, in 
general the sufficiency part of the above theorem holds only locally. In fact, in 
the proof of Theorem 2 we have proved that the fundamental solution of a linear 
symmetric Hamiltonian system is symplectic at any time. 
Corollary 4 Let y E CI([O, r], C(R2n )) for some r > 0 satisfy the initial value 
problem of the linear Hamiltonian system, 
{ y(t) = 1 A(t)y(t), 
y(O) = /, 
(10) 
where A E C([0,r],C(R2n)). ThenAT(t) = A(t) ifandonlyify(t) E Sp(2n)for 
all t E [0, r]. y is called the associated symplectic path of A. 
Proof: The conclusion follows from (9). 
D 

3.2 Generating functions 
85 
Remark 5 Theorem 2 and Corollary 4 explain why the topological structures of 
the symplectic group Sp(2n) and its subsets must get into the study of Hamiltonian 
systems. 
Similarly we also have 
Proposition 6 Let a < b be two real numbers. If x Eel «a, b), R2n) is a solution 
of the autonomous Hamiltonian system 
i = J H'(x), 
where HEel (R2n , R), then H(x(t)) is constant for all t E (a , b). 
Proof: In fact, for a < t < b, 
d 
dt H(x(t)) = H'(x(t)) . i(t) = H'(x(t)) . J H'(x(t)) = 0. 
Thus the proposition follows. 
o 
3.2 Generating functions 
In this section we continue our study on canonical transformations. By (1.7) a dif-
feomorphism u : W f-+ x = u(w) on (R2n , w) is canonical if and only if u*w = w, 
where x = (t TJ), W = (q , p), ~ = Hq , p), TJ = TJ(q , p), 
n 
W = Ldpi /\ dqi == dp /\ dq. 
i=1 
If Q is any oriented bounded surface of dimension 2,we denote its boundary by aQ. 
Then by the Stokes formula we have that u*w = (j) is equivalent to the condition that 
u is area preserving, i.e., 
{ w = ( 
w, 
V Q.

L(n) 
Since fan pdq = fu(an) pdq, it is further equivalent to

Hamiltonian systems and canonical transformations 
depends only on (q, p) and is independent of the choice of the integral paths. 
Therefore 
dS(q, p) = pdq -
TJd~. 
Suppose now we can choose (~, q) as independent variables in a neighborhood of 
some point (qO, po), i.e., we suppose on the point (qO, po) that 
det a(q, ~) = det a~ I O. 
a(q, p) 
ap 
(1) 
By the implicit function theorem, p can be represented as a function of (q, ~). Thus 
near this point the function S can be represented by 
Seq, p(q,~)) = V(q, n 
(2) 
Definition 1 The function V (q, ~) is called the generating function of the canonical 
transformation x = u(w). 
Lemma 2 Suppose V(q,~) is afunction defined in a neighborhoodofapoint(qo, ~o), 
and satisfies 
Then V is the generating function of some canonical transformation. 
Proof: We consider the following equation on ~: 
aV(q, ~) =p. 
(3) 
Let PO = (av~:,s))I(qo,so)' By the implicit function theorem, in a neighborhood of 
the point (qO, ~o) this equation can be solved in terms of ~ to obtain a function 
Let g(q,~) = -
av~~,o . We define 
TJ = g(q, Hq, p)). 
Then in the above neighborhood, the map u 
(q, p) t-+ 
(~, TJ) = u(q, p) is a 
canonical transformation in R 2n. Since

3.2 Generating functions

then V is the generating function of the canonical transformation (~, 1]) = u(q, p). o 
By the uniqueness of the function determined by the implicit function theorem, for 
a given canonical transformation x = u(w), its generating function V(q,~) in this 
lemma generates precisely x = u (w) itself. 
The above discussion establishes a relation between canonical transformations and 
generating functions. But it guarantees only that those canonical transformations 
which satisfy the condition (1) possess generating functions. Note that the simplest 
canonical transformation, i.e., the identity map ~ = q and 1] = p, does not satisfy 
this condition. Next we show that for any given canonical transformation, we always 
can choose the coordinate function system to construct its generating function. 
Denote the variables in R2n by q = (ql, ... , qn) and p = (PI, ... , Pn). Let 
a(i,j) = (.1 
II 
k

be an n-permutation. There are 2n such permutations in total. For a given n-permutation 
a(i, j), we denote 
We consider the n-dimensional isotropic subspace defined by any n variables of 
(ql, ... , qn, PI, ... , Pn) in the symplectic space (R 2n , w). This is a Lagrange sub-
space. For every n-permutation of (1, ... , n), we associate an isotropic coordinate 
plane in R2n whose n corresponding coordinates (q(a, i), p(a, j» are all identically 
zero. We simply denote this isotropic coordinate plane by (q(a, i), p(a, j». There 
are 2n such isotropic coordinate planes in total. 
Remark 3 Two subspaces Ll and L2 of a given vector space L are transverse, if 
L I + L2 = L. By this definition, two n-dimensional subspaces of R 2n are transverse 
if and only if their intersection contains only the origin. 
Lemma 4 Any Lagrange subspace A of (R2n , w) must be transverse to at least one 
of these 2n isotropic coordinate planes. 
Proof: Let P denote the isotropic coordinate plane (ql, ... , qn), (cf. Figure 1). Let 
T = A n P, and k = dim T with 0 :::: k :::: n. Then T as a subspace of P must be 
transverse to at least an (n-k) dimensional coordinate plane, say S = (%, ... , qin-k). 
Thus 
T + S = P, 
Tn S = {OJ. 
Let a(i, j) be the n-permutation (iI, ... , in- k. h, ... , A) obtained from extending 
the (n - k) integers (il, ... , in-k). Denote by M the n-dimensional isotropic plane 
according to a(i, j). Then S = M n P. By TeA and A ..1 A (symplectic 
orthogonal), we obtain T ..1 A. From SCM and M ..1 M, there holds S ..1 M. Thus

Then 
An M = (A n P) n (M n P) = Tn S = {OJ. 
This proves the lemma.

Given any canonical transformation, next we prove the existence of at least one 
n-permutation a(i, j) of (1, ... ,n) such that the corresponding functions (~(a, i), 
1](a, j)) are independent of q, from which therefore the generating function can be 
constructed. 
Theorem 5 (cr. V.I. Arnold, p. 267 or [Am2]). Let u : R2n -+ R2n be a canonical 
transformation given by ~ = ~(q, p) and 1] = 1](q, p). In a neighborhood of any 
point Wo = (qO, po), among the 2n set functions (q, ~(a, i), 1](a, j)) corresponding 
to all n-permutations {a(i, j)}, there exists at least one which gives independent 
coordinates ofR2n, i.e.,for this a(i, j), 
det a(q, ~(a, i), 1](a, j)) = det a(Ha, i), 1](a, j)) =f. O. 
(4) 
a(q, p) 
a(Pl, ... , Pn) 
In a neighborhood of this point Wo, the canonical transformation u has generating 
function

where

and p = p(Ha, i), ry(a, j)) is the function relation uniquely determined by the 
implicit function theorem and the condition (4). u can be redefined implicitly by 
the equation: 
av 
p= iii' 
av 
~j = -a ' 
ryj 
Vice versa, suppose a given function V(q, ~(a, i), ry(a, j)) satisfies 
(5) 
Then (5) gives a canonical transformation in a neighborhood of the point (qO, ~ (a, 00, 
ry(a, j)o). 
Proof: This proof is almost the same as the special case of det ~! =1= 0 discussed in 
Lemma 2. It suffices to prove that among all 2n function groups there is at least one 
(q, ~(a, i), ry(a, j)) which makes (4) hold. 
Thus, viewing R2n to be the tangent space at the point (qO, po), we obtain that 
uw(wo) : R2n -+ R2n is a symplectic linear map, and denote it by S.

Let A be the n-dimensional isotropic plane (PI, ... , Pn) in R2n (cf. Figure 2). 
This is a Lagrange subspace, whose image SA under S is also a Lagrange subspace. 
By Lemma 4, SA must be transverse to one of the 2n isotropic coordinate plane of 
dimension n defined there. Denote this isotropic plane by B = (q(a, i), pea, j)).

Define an n-dimensional isotropic plane M = (q(a, j), p(a, i)), and denote by T 
the projection from S A to M. The condition (4) is equivalent to the composition map 
T S : A -+ M being non-singular. Since S is non-singular, and T is non-singular too 
by the transversality, T S must be non-singular.

Remark 6 Theorem 5 and its proof is taken from Section 48 in [Arn2] of v.1. Arnold. 

Chapter 4 
The variational functional 
In this chapter, we study finite dimensional approximation methods for Hamiltonian 
systems. In Section I, we study the Galerkin approximation method for Hamiltonian 
systems. Then in Section 2 we define the functional corresponding to the general 
nonlinear Hamiltonian systems on the space L of square integrable periodic functions 
and study its basic properties. In Section 3 we introduce the saddle point reduction 
method. In Section 4 we study the dimension of the kernal of the reduced functional 
corresponding to the given Hamiltonian system. In Section 5, we derive certain useful 
estimates on the reduced functional. Results in Sections 2 to 5 form the most basic 
part of the saddle point reduction method. 
For the theory of Sobolev spaces we refer readers to the books of R. Adams [Adal] 
and D. Gilbarg and N. Trudinger [GiTl]. For discussions on nonlinear functional 
analysis and critical point theory, we refer to the books of J. Aubin and I. Ekeland 
[AuEI], K.C. Chang [Cha6], w.Y. Chen [Chell (in Chinese), K. Deimling [Deil], 
D.J. Guo [Guol] (in Chinese), M. Krasnosel'skii [Kral], L. Nirenberg [Nirl], 
P.H. Rabinowitz [Rab7], J. Schwartz [Stzl], and E. Zeidler [Zeil]. The spectrum 
decomposition theory of the unbounded linear selfadjoint operators can be found in 
many text books of functional analysis, for example those of F. Riesz and B.Sz. Nagy 
[RiNI] and K.c. Chang, M.Z. Guo, and Y.Q. Lin [CGU] (in Chinese). 
4.1 
The Galerkin approximation 
We give an introduction to the Galerkin approximation method for Hamiltonian sys-
tems in this section. We consider the Hamiltonian system 
i = J H'(t, x), 
(1 ) 
In the following, we always suppose that the Hamiltonian function H satisfies the 
following conditions: 
(HI) H E C2(R x R2n, R), and for some i > 0 it is i-periodic in the time 
variable t, i.e., 
H(t + i, x) = H(t , x), 
Vet, x) E R x R2n. 
(H2) There exist constants a > 0 and p > I such that 
IHI/(t, x)1 :::: a(l + IxI P) , 
V(t,x) E R x R2n. 
In the study of its i-periodic solutions, a rather important property of the Hamil-
tonian system is that it possesses a variational structure, i.e., it is the Euler equation 

92

The variational functional 
of a certain functional defined on a suitable function space. In order to study the 
existence and other properties of r -periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian system (1), 
in the following we introduce a direct variational method, and define a functional 
corresponding to (1) whose critical points correspond to r-periodic solutions of (1) 
precisely. Then our problem can be solved by using the critical point theory which 
has been developed greatly in recent years. 
Definition 1 Let X and Y be two Banach spaces. U is an open subset of X. I : 
U ~ Y is a given map. I is Gateaux differentiable at x E U, if for any hEX 
there exists y E Y such that 
I(x + th) - I(x) - ty = oCt), 
as t ~ O+,x +th E U, 
where oCt) as t ~ 0+ is defined by limHo,t>o oCt) = O. In this case y is called the 
Gateaux derivative of I at x along the direction h, and is denoted by dl (x )h. 
I is Frt!chet differentiable (or simply differentiable) at x E U, if there exists a 
continuous linear map A : X ~ Y such that for any hEX and x + h E U, 
II/(x + h) - I(x) - Ahlly = o(lIhllx), 
as IIhllx ~ O. 
In this case A is called the Frechet derivative of I at x, and is denoted it by I' (x). 
If I is differentiable everywhere on U and I' is continuous on U, we denote it by 
I E C 1 (U, n. Similarly the higher order derivatives of I can be defined. 
Let I E C1(X, R). If I'(X) = 0 for some x E X, the point x is a critical point 
of I and c = I (x) is the critical value of I at x. Define 
Ke(f) = {x E X I I'(X) = 0, I(x) = c} 
and K(f) = {x E X I I'(X) = OJ. 
Recall that a bounded linear operator T : X ~ Y is Fredholm, if the range R(T) 
is closed, and both dim ker (K) and codimR(T) are finite. 
Let W be a separable Hilbert space with inner product (', .) and norm II . II. Suppose 
that A : W ~ W is a bounded self-adjoint operator with finite dimensional kernel 
N, and the restriction AINl. is invertible. Denote by P : W ~ N the corresponding 
orthogonal projection. Let g E C2(W, R) possess a compact derivative g'. Our aim 
is to solve the operator equation 
Ax = g'(X).

Define

I(x) = 2(Ax,x) - g(x), 
"Ix E W. 
(3) 
Then I E c2ew, R), and the critical point of I corresponds to solutions of the 
equation (1). To transform this infinite dimensional problem into a finite dimensional 
one, we consider the following reduction: 
Definition 2 Let r = {Pm 1m E N} be a sequence of orthogonal projections. r is a 
Galerkin approximation scheme with respect to A if the following three conditions 
hold: 

4.1 The Galerkin approximation 
1 ° W m == Pm W is finite dimensional for all mEN, 
2° Pm -+ 1 strongly as m -+ 00, 
3° [Pm, A] == PmA - APm -+ 0 in the operator norm. 
93 
Definition 3 f satisfies the (P.S)* condition on W with respect to { Pm}, if any 
sequence {xm} C W satisfying Xm E W m and for which there exists a constant b > 0 
such that 
f~(xm) -+ 0 
III 
W

m -+ 00, 
Ifm(xm)1 < b, 
"1m 2: 0, 
possesses a convergent subsequence in W. 
The following result follows from the above definition immediately. 
Theorem 4 Suppose the functional f satisfies the (P. S)* condition on W with respect 
to {Pm}. 1fthere exist two constants bi < b2 in R such that fm possesses a critical 
point Xm with bi :'S f m (xm) :'S b2for any mEN, the functional f possesses a critical 
point x in W with f (x) E [bl, b2]. 
To apply the Galerkin approximation method to the Hamiltonian system (I), recall 
that W = W I /2,2(S" R2n) with r > 0 and S, = R/(rZ) is defined to be the 
subspace of L 2 (S" R 2n) which consists of all elements 
satisfying

Then W becomes a Hilbert space. We denote its inner product and norm by (', .) and

Suppose the conditions (HI) and (H2) hold. We can define a functional on the 
space W by 
g(x) = foT H(t, x(t))dt, 
\Ix E W. 
Then g E C2(E, R) has compact derivative, and 
lex) = H '(·, x(·» , 
gl/(x)y = HI/(·, x(.»y(.). 
(7) 
(8) 
(9) 
Define a functional f : W -+ R by (3) with the above g. Then f E C2(W, R), 
and critical points of f correspond to solutions of the abstract equation (3), and then 
correspond to I-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian system (1). 
In order to find critical points of f, for any BEe (ST, .cs (R 2n», define an operator 
B: W -+ Wby 
(Bx, y) = foT B(t)x(t) . y(t)dt,

Then B is a compact linear self-adjoint operator. 
Lemma 5 For any B E CCST, .cs(R2n», the value 0 is isolated in {OJ U a(A - B). 
Proof: Let sign(k) = k/lkl when k E R\{O}. Let Ok,j = 0 if k =f. j, and Ok,j = 1 
otherwise. Since the operator B is compact and self-adjoint on the Hilbert space W, 
there exists a sequence Ak -+ 0 and a basis {ek} of (JJkl-OFk such that 
(Aek, e j) = sign(k)ok,j , 
(Bek, z) = (AAkek, z),

Corollary 6 (G. Fei and Q. Qiu [FeQl]). Let {Pm: W ~ Wm} be the Galerkin

Let Sr = R/(TZ). Define L = L 2(S" R2n) equipped with the usual norm

The variational functional 
Then L becomes a Hilbert space. Denote the corresponding inner product of L by 
(., ·)L. Let W = W1,2(ST, R2n) be the space of all vector functions from ST to R2n 
possessing square integrable first order derivatives. On the space we define the norm 
( t 
)1/2 
IIxllw = 10 (lx(t)1 2 + Ix(t)12)dt 
, 
"Ix E W. 
Under this norm, W becomes a Hilbert space. This is the Sobolev space of r-periodic 
functions. W is a dense subspace of L. One of the most important properties of this 
space is that the following famous Sobolev and Rellich embedding theorem holds 
in it. 
Theorem 1 Suppose r > O. Then there exists a constant K > 0 such that 
IIxlle ::: Kllxllw, 
"Ix E W, 
where IIxlle = maxO<t<T Ix(t)l, and the embedding mapfrom W to the continuous 
function space C = C(ST, R 2n ), equipped with the norm II . lie, is compact. 
x E W is a weak r-periodic solution of the Hamiltonian system (1), if 
Vy E W. 
(3) 
Theorem 2 Under the conditions (HI) and (H3), weak solutions of (1)-(2) are 
classical solutions. 
Proof: Suppose x E W is a weak solution of the periodic boundary value problem 
(1)-(2). By the Sobolev imbedding theorem, we have x E C(ST' R 2n ). Since the 
fact that x satisfies (3) implies that it satisfies (1) almost everywhere in ST' by (1) the 
derivative i can be extended continuously to all of ST' This proves x E Ci(ST' R2n), 
i.e., x is a classical solution of (1)-(2).

In the Hilbert space L we define an operator Ax = - J X. Then the domain of A 
is domA = W. The range of A is closed and the resolution of A is compact. Under 
the norm of the space L, the spectrum of the operator A is a (A) = 2; Z. It is a point 
spectrum, i.e., it contains only eigenvalues, and the multiplicity of every eigenvalue 
is 2n. The eigensubspace of A belonging to the eigenvalue 2~Jr is 
( 2k:rr:t )

4.3 The saddle point reduction 
97 
Define a functional on the space L by 
g(x) = foT H(t, x(t))dt. 
(4) 
By the conditions (HI) and (H3), we have g E C\L, R), and 
g'(x) = H'(t, x(t)). 
(5) 
g' (x) is Gadeaux differentiable, its Gateaux derivative is 
dg'(x)y = HI/(t, x(t))y, 
(6) 
and there exists a constant c(H) > 0 such that 
Ildg'(x)ILCCL) :'S c(H). 
(7) 
Define a functional 
1 
lex) = 2(Ax, X}L - g(x), 
Vx E domA = W. 
(8) 
Under the conditions (HI) and (H3), / E C 1 (W, R), /' is Gadeaux differentiable. 
Define an equation in the space L by 
Ax = g'(x), 
for 
x E W. 
(9) 
Then (9) is precisely the Euler equation of the functional/on the space L, i.e., 
(f'(x), y}L = (Ax - lex), Y}L, 
Vy E w. 
(10) 
Therefore critical points of / are solutions of the equation (9). Note that the equa-
tion (9) is equivalent to the r-periodic boundary value problem of the Hamiltonian 
system (1). Thus the problem of finding r-periodic solutions of the Hamiltonian sys-
tem (1) is equivalent to that of finding critical points of the functional/in the space W. 
4.3 The saddle point reduction 
In the previous section, we have defined by (2.8) the functional/corresponding to the 
periodic boundary value problem of the Hamiltonian system (2.1)-(2.2). Note that 
/ is strongly indefinite, and the Morse indices of / at its critical points are always 
infinite. These cause substantial difficulties in finding critical points of / and in 
applying the Morse theory to related problems. In this section, a Lyapunov-Schmidt 
reduction method, the saddle point reduction method, is introduced to reduce problem 
in infinite dimensional spaces to discussions on finite dimensional spaces, and at the 
same time the finiteness of the Morse indices is achieved.

The variational functional 
To the author's knowledge, the saddle point reduction method was introduced 
by H. Amann [Amal]. The saddle point reduction Theorem I below was proved 
by H. Amann and E. Zehnder in their celebrated paper [AmZl] of 1980 using the 
monotone operator theory. Then K.C. Chang gave a simpler and more direct proof 
in [Chal] of 1981. Our discussion in this section is a combination of their ideas in 
the case of Hamiltonian systems. For the saddle point reduction method in a more 
general setting, we refer to [AmZl] and [Cha6]. 
As in Sections 1 and 2, we suppose the Hamiltonian function H satisfies the con-
ditions (HI) and (H3). For the case of given period r > 0, we have already defined 
the Hilbert spaces L and W, the operator A on W, the functional g, and the functional 
f corresponding to (2.1)-(2.2). Let Po : L --+ Eo = R2n be the projection map. 
Since zero is an eigenvalue of the operator A, in order to improve the property of A 
we define an invertible operator Ao on the space W by 
Aox = Ax + Pox, 
"Ix E W. 
(1) 
Then domAo = W, it is self-adjoint and invertible, its range is closed, and its reso-
lution is compact as is that of A. The spectrum of Ao is a(Ao) = {l} U 2: (Z\ {O}), 
and is a point spectrum. If 1 rf. 2: (Z \ {O}), then the multiplicity of every eigen-
value is 2n. The eigensubspace of the operator Ao belonging to the eigenvalue 1 is 
Eo = R2n = ker Ao. For k E Z \ {OJ, the eigensubspaces of Ao and A belonging 
to the eigenvalue 2k;r Ir are the same Ek defined in Section 2. If I E 2: (Z\{O}), then 
the mUltiplicity of 1 is 4n, and the eigensubspace belonging to 1 is Eo EEl Ek where 
the integer k satisfies 1 = 2k;r I r . 
Since the Hamiltonian function H satisfies the conditions (HI) and (H3), the func-
tional g satisfies (2.7). Without loss of generality, we suppose the constant c(H) there 
satisfies c(H) rf. a(Ao) and c(H) > 1. Denote by {E).} the spectral resolution of the 
selfadjoint operator Ao; we define the projections on the space L by 
1

l-C(H) 
p+ = 
dE)., 
P- = 
dE)., 
c(H) 
-00 
Q- = 10 dE).. 
-00 
Then the Hilbert space L possesses an orthogonal decomposition 
L = L + EEl L - EEl Z, 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
where Z = PL, L± = P±L. Next we define projections S± E C(L, L±) and 
R E C(L, Z) on the space L according to the inverse of the square root of the 
operator I Ao I by 
(5) 
(6) 

4.3 The saddle point reduction 
Then S±IL± and Rlz are injections, and 
AO(S+)2 = P +, 
-AO(S- )2 = P-, 
Ao(RQ+)2 = PQ+, 
-Ao(RQ- )2 = PQ- , 
(S+)2 _ (S- )2 + (RQ+)2 _ (RQ-)2 = A(j!. 
99 
(7) 
(8) 
(9) 
Since Ao is self-adjoint, all the above operators are self-adjoint. Define a subspace 
Y of L by 
Y = y + E9 Y- E9 Yo, 
(10) 
where 
y± = S±L± , 
yO = RZ. 
(11) 
If the norm of the space Y is defined by 
where v = v+ + v- + vO E y+ E9 Y- E9 yO = Y, then Y is isometric to the Sobolev 
fraction exponent space W I/2.2(ST , R 2n ). 
For any x = x+ + x- + Z E L + E9 L - E9 Z = L, we define two functionals 
1 
go(x) = g(x) + 2(Pox, X)L, 
(13) 
and 
where v = S+x+ + S- x - + Rz and the functional g is defined by (2.4). Note that 
g E CI(L, R) and g'(v) is Gadeaux differentiable; thus we obtain that fo is Cion 
L, and f6(x) is Gadeaux differentiable. For any x = x+ + x- + z E L, we have 
(S+)-IS+X+, (S+)-IS+X+)L 
(AoS+x+, S+X+)L. 
(15) 
Similar relations also hold for IIx-lIi, II Q+zlli, and II Q-zlli. From these, we obtain 
1 
foex) 
2(Aov, V)L - go(v)

2(Av, V)L - g(v) 
(16) 
f(v),

The variational functional 
The Euler equation of the functional fo in the sense of the space L is given by 
x± = ±S±gb(v), 
Q±z = ±Q± Rgb(v), 
(17) 
(18) 
where v = S+ x+ + S-x- + Rz. Thus the solutions of (17) and (18) in L are in one 
to one correspondence to critical points of fo. By (16) they are also critical points 
of f, and therefore are in one to one correspondence to periodic solutions of the 
Hamiltonian system (2.1). 
Now we fix z E Z and solve the equation (17) for x±. We shall prove that the 
right-hand side of the equation (17) defines a contraction mapping on the space L, 
and then by the implicit function theorem the solution x± can be obtained. 
By the condition (H3), we obtain 
v v, vEL. 
(19) 
From the definitions of Ao and P±, as well as c(H) ~ a (Ao), there exists a constant 
y > c(H) such that 
(20) 
Thus for any x = x+ + x- + z and i = i+ + i- + z E L, defining v = S+x+ 
+ S-x- + Rz and v = S+i+ + S-i- + Rz, we obtain 
II(S+ - S-)[gb(v) - gb(v)]IIL 
::s II (S+)2 - (S-)2 I1c(L)II(S+ - S-)-l(gb(v) - gb(v))IIL 
::s c(H) II(S+ + S-)-lllc(L)IIS+(x+ - i+) + S-(x- - i-)IIL 
y 
c(H) 
::s --llx -iIiL. 
y 
(21) 
Here in the proof of the second inequality, we have used (9), (19), and (20). This 
proves that the right-hand side of (17) defines a contraction mapping. Thus for any 
z E Z, (17) possesses a unique solution x±(z). Since gb is symmetric and Gadeaux 
differentiable, the equation (17) also yields x± E CI(Z, V). 
Noting that the projection R can be viewed as an invertible map from the space Z 
to itself, we define a map on the space Z by 
u(z) = w(z) + z, 
w(z) = S+x+(R-1z) + S-x-(R-1z). 
(22) 
By the definitions of the operators S± and the space V, u maps the space Z into 
W = domA. Since the solution obtained from (17) satisfies x± E CI(Z, V), we 
have u E CI(Z, W). 

4.3 The saddle point reduction 
Now we define a functional on the space Z by 
a(z) 
fo(x+(R-1z) +x-(R-1z) + R-1z) 
1 2(llx+(R-1z)III + IIQ+R-1zIII 
-IIQ-R-1zIII - IIx-(R-1z)III) - go(u(z)). 
For any z E Z, by (15) we obtain 
a(z) 
1 
2(Aou(z), U(Z))L - go(u(z)) 
1 
2(Au(z), U(Z))L - g(u(z)) 
= f(u(z)). 
From the definition (22) for any z E Z, 
u'(z)* = R-1TJ+ S+ + R-1TJ- S- + P, 
where TJ± = (x±)' (R- 1 z)*. By (7)-(9) we obtain 
u'(z)* Aou(z) = R-1TJ+ S+ AoS+x+(R-1z) 
101 
(23) 
(24) 
(25) 
+R-1TJ- S-AoS-x-(R-1 z) + Aoz 
(26) 
Therefore by (24), 
= R-1TJ+x+(R-1z) - R-1TJ-x-(R-1z) + Aoz. 
a'(z) = u'(z)*[Aou(z) - gb(u(z))] 
= Aoz -
Pgb(u(z)) 
= Aou(z) - gb(u(z)) 
= Az - Pg'(u(z)) 
= Au(z) - g'(u(z)). 
Here in the proof of (27) we have used (17) and (26). 
(27) 
By (19) and (27), we obtain that a' is globally Lipschitz continuous on Z. Since 
g' is Gateaux differentiable and u = u(z) is C 1, we obtain a E C2(Z, R) and 
al/(z) = AoP -
Pdgb(u(z))u'(z) 
= [Ao - dgb(u(z))]u'(z) 
= AP -
Pdg'(u(z))u'(z) 
= [A - dg'(u(z))]u'(z). 
(28) 
Thus our above discussion on the i-periodic boundary value problem of the 
Hamiltonian system (2.1) produces the following reduction theorem.

The variational functional 
Theorem 1 (H. Amann and E. Zehnder [AmZl], K.C. Chang [Cha6]). Suppose 
the Hamiltonian function H satisfies the condition (HI) and (H3). Then there exist 
a E C2(Z, R) and an injection map u E C l (Z, L) such that u : Z -* W = domA 
satisfies the following conditions: 
1° The map u has theform u = w(z) + z, where Pw(z) = o. 
2° The functional a satisfies 
a(z) 
f(u(z» 
1 
= 2(Au(z), U(Z»)L - g(u(z)) 
a' (z) = Az - Pg'(u(z)) 
= Au(z) - g'(u(z)), 
a" (z) = AP - Pdg' (u(z))u' (z) 
[A - dg' (u (z))]u' (z). 
And a' is globally Lipschitz continuous. 
3° z E Z is a critical point of a, i.e., a' (z) = 0, if and only if u (z) is a solution 
of Au = g' (u), i.e., a critical point of f, if and only if u (z) is a r -periodic 
solution of the Hamiltonian system (2.1). 
4° If g'(u) = Bu for all u E L, where B is the induced linear operator on the 
space L from a constant symmetric matrix B(t) == B defined on R2n, then 
a(z) = 1(A - B)z, Z)L. 
5° If:E is a topological space, for any a E :E the functional g : :E x L -* R 
satisfies g(a,·) E CI(L, R), g' E C(:E xL, R), and the inequality (18) with 
the constant f3 being independent from a E :E. Then the corrsponding map 
u = u(a, z) and its derivative u~(a, z) with respect to z are all continuous. 
Proof: 1°-3° have been proved. 4° follows from the fact B P = P B. We leave the 
proof of 5° to the readers.

4.4 The dimension theorem on kernels 
For the Hamiltonian system (2.1), in the previous two sections we have defined the 
space L = L2(Sy, R2n) and the corresponding functional f. By using the saddle 
point reduction method the map u : Z -* L from the finite dimensional space Z to 
the space L and the functional a(z) = f(u(z» on Z are defined. The one to one 
correspondence relation between the critical point z of a and the critical point u (z) 
of f is established. In this section we shall establish the relation on the dimensions 
of the kernels of a"(z) and df'(u(z)). 
Fix a constant r > O. Suppose the Hamiltonian function H satisfies (HI) and 
(H3). Let z E Z be a critical point of a, let u(z) = w(z) + z given by (3.22). Then 
Pw(z) = 0 and u(z) E L is a critical point of f. By the definition of f and the 

4.4 The dimension theorem on kernels 
103 
equation (2.5), ~ E ker df(u(z)) if and only if ~ is a r-periodic solution ofthe linear 
Hamiltonian system 
y = J H"(t, u(z)(t»y. 
(1) 
Denote by yet) the fundamental solution of (1). Then by the classical Floquet theory, 
the dimension of the r -periodic solution space of the linear system (l) is equal to 
dimker(y(r) - /) == VI (y(r)). The following theorem yields the relation between 
this dimension and the dimension of the kernel of a" (z). 
Theorem 1 (E. Zehnder [Zeh2]). Under the above conditions, 
dim ker a"(z) = vl(y(r». 
(2) 
Proof: Using the notation of the previous section, let pJ.. = p+ + P-. By 
Theorem 3.1, especially the equation (3.28), for any ~ E Z we obtain 
(3) 
On the other hand, by (3.17) we obtain 
S±x±(R-1z) = ±(s±)2gb(u(z». 
Thus for any ~ E Z, 
dw(z)~ = d(S+x+(R-1z) + S-x-(R-1Z»~ 
[(S+)2dgb(u(z) -
(S-)2dgb(u(z))]u'(z)~ 
(4) 
= AOI pJ..dgb(u(z»(~ + dw(z)O. 
This yields 
v ~ E Z. 
(5) 
Suppose ~ E ker a" (z). Let TJ = dw(z)~ and ~ = ~ + TJ. Then from (3) and (5) 
we obtain 
AoP~ 
That is 
Pdgb(u(z))~, 
pJ..dgb(u(z»~. 
Ao~ = dgb(u(z»r 
By the definitions of Ao and gO, this yields 
A~ = dg'(u(z)L 
i.e., ~ is a solution of the linear system (1). 
(6) 
(7) 

104 
4 
The variational functional 
On the other hand, suppose;; is a solution of the linear system (1). Let ~ = p;; 
and rJ = pl.;;. Then;; = ~ + rJ, They satisfy (6) and (7) respectively. Since the 
operator Ao is invertible, (7) yields 
rJ = Ao! pl.dgb(u(z»(~ + rJ)· 
Since (3.19) and (3.20) hold, for any rJI and rJ2 E pl. L, we have 
IIAo! pl.dgb(u(z))(~ + rJd - Ao! pl.dgb(u(z))(~ + m)llL S ~lIrJI - milL· 
y 
(8) 
Since f3 y < 1, when ~ E Z is fixed, the right-hand side of (8) is a contraction mapping 
on pl. L. Therefore rJ is the unique solution of (8). But by (5), for ~ = p;;, dw(z)~ 
is also a solution of (8). Therefore, 
rJ = dw(z)~. 
Then (3) and (6) yield ~ E ker a" (z). 
By the relation;; = ~ + dw(z)~ in our above argument, linearly independent ~s 
in ker a" (z) correspond to linearly independent solutions;; of (1). Thus the theorem 
is proved.

Remark 2 The dimension Theorem 4.1 on kernels is due to E. Zehnder [Zeh2]. The 
proof given here is a modification of his original one. 
4.5 Certain estimates 
Fix a constant r > O. In this section we prove inequalities satisfied by the functional 
a(z) = f(u(z)) and the injection u(z) on Z defined by Theorem 3.1 with notations 
there. 
Part 1 Estimates on the reduced functional 
Theorem 1 (H. Amann and E. Zehnder [AmZl]). Suppose the Hamiltonfunction 
H satisfies (HI) and (H3). Then for any Z E Z, functional a(z) defined by (3.23) 
satisfies 
where p- is defined by (3.2), w(z) = u(z) - z is defined by (3.22). 
Proof: Using notations in Section 2, we first consider the function fo defined by 
(3.14). For any x = x+ + x- + z E L + EB L - EB Z = L, we obtain 
(2) 

4.5 Certain estimates 
Therefore, for the x+ = x+ (z) determined by (3.17), 
(fo)~+(x+(z) + x-(z) + z) = 0, 
Vz E Z. 
For any h + z E L + EB Z and t E R, let 
1 
¢(t) = 2(lIx+(z) + thlli + II Q+zlli -
II Q-zlli - IIx-(z)lIi) 
-go(S+(x+(z) + th) + S-x-(z) + z). 
Then by (3) and the fact that gb is Gadeaux differentiable, we obtain 
¢'(t) = (x+(z), h)L + tllhlli 
-(gb(S+(x+(z) + th) + S-x-(z) + z), S+h)L, 
¢//(t) = Ilhlli - (dgb(S+(x+(z) + th) + S-x- + z)S+h, S+h)L. 
105 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
By (3.9) we obtain (S+)2 = AOIIL+. Since c(H) rf. O'(Ao), by the definition (3.5) 
of S+, there exists a constant JL > c(H) such that 
1 
I 
IIAolu 11- :s-. 
JL 
Since S+ is selfadjoint, by (2.6), from (6) and (7) we obtain 
(7) 
¢//(t) 2: (l_cC;:»)lIhlli >0, 
VhEL+\{O},tER. 
(8) 
Thus for any z E Z, from (3) and (8) as a function of x+ E L +, the functional 
fo(x+ + x-(z) + z) is convex along any line passing through x+(z), and thus takes 
a global minimal value at x+ (z), i.e., 
Therefore for any z E Z by the definition (3.23) of a(z) we have 
a(z) = fo(x+(R-1z) + x-(R-1z) + R-1z) 
:S fo(x-(R-1z) + R-1z). 
By (3.16) and the definition of v below (3.14) this implies 
1 
a(z) :s 2(A(S-x-(R-1z) +z, S-x-(R-1z) +Z)L 
-g(S-x-(R-1z) + z). 
(10) 
(11) 
By the definition of P- and the definition of w(z) = u(z) - z in (3.22), we have 
P-w(z) = S-x-(R-1z). Thus (11) implies (1). This proves the theorem.

The variational functional 
The proof of the following proposition is similar to that of Theorem 1, and thus is 
left to the readers. 
Proposition 2 (H. Amann and E. Zehnder [AmZl]). Suppose H satisfies (HI), 
(H3), and 
(H4) H(t, x) = o(x) at x = 0. 
Then 
a(z)

Part 2 Estimates on the injection map 
Fix a Hamiltonian function H satisfying conditions (HI) and (H3). Based on 
objects defined and notation introduced in Section 2, for s 2: c(H) and s rf. 2; Z, 
we define new projection operators Ps, Ps±' S~, and Rs using formulae (3.2), (3.5) 
and (3.6) with the integration limit c(H) there being replaced by s. Then we get the 
corresponding spaces decomposition L = Lt EB C; EB Zs and V = V/ EB Vs- EB VsO. 
By our study in Section 2, the system (3.17)-(3.18) becomes 
(13) 
(14) 
where Vs = S; x+ + S; x- + Rsz. Then for every z E Zs the system (13) possesses 
a unique solution pair x~(z) satisfying x~ E C2(Zs, V/) n C2(Zs, W). Define 
us(z) = S;x;(z)+S;x;(z)+Rszforallz E Zs. Then the functional as : Zs -+ R 
is given by Theorem 3.1: 
By Theorem 3.1, as E C2(Zs, R), US E C2(Zs, W) is an injection. 
Proposition 3 For any s 2: c(H), s rf. a(A), x E W, 
lIus(Psx) - xllw -+ 0, 
as s -+ +00. 
(16) 
Proof: For x E W, by Theorem 3.1 we have us(Psx) E W. Let P/- = p/ + Ps-. 
Then by (13) similarly to (3.22) we obtain 
S;X;(R;l Psx) + S;x;(R;l Psx) - p/"x

Part III 
Index Theory 
In recent years the classical Morse index theory has been applied to the case of 
functionals on infinite dimensional spaces, and plays an important role in the study 
of many nonlinear problems. Unfortunately, the Morse indices of the functional 
corresponding to a Hamiltonian system at its critical point are always infinite. This 
produces a great difficulty for applications of the Morse index theory on Hamiltonian 
systems. The main goal of Part III is to introduce an index function theory parameter-
ized by the unit circle in the complex plane for paths in symplectic groups. Especially 
the index theory corresponding to the parameter I yields a finite representation of the 
above mentioned infinite Morse indices for Hamiltonian systems. 
This index function theory for paths in symplectic groups parameterized by W E U 
is established in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 we study further properties of this index 
function theory, especially we establish its relation theorem with the Morse index 
theory of the reduced functional obtained via the saddle point reduction method. We 
also give an axiom characterization of it. Finally in Chapter 7 we study its relation-
ship with other Morse index theories. Such studies are based on the algebraic and 
topological structures of Sp(2n) and its subsets, variational structures of Hamiltonian 
systems obtained in the previous two parts. 
For historical remarks on this index function theory, the readers are referred to the 
Introduction of this book. 

Chapter 5 
Index functions for symplectic paths 
In this chapter, we introduce an index function theory for paths in the symplectic 
groups started from the identity, i.e., elements in P r (2n) with i > 0 defined by 
(2.0.1): 
P r (2n) = {y E C([O, i], Sp(2n)) I yeO) = l}. 
For i > 0 and OJ E U, we further define the set of OJ-non-degenerate paths by 
P; w(2n) = {y E P r (2n)) I Y(i) E Sp(2n)~}, 
and the set of OJ-degenerate paths by 
(1) 
(2) 
Based upon the topological structures of the symplectic group Sp(2n) and its sub-
sets, we can give a complete homotopy classification of all paths in P;,w (2n) for any 
OJ E U. Based on this homotopy classification, the index function theory is defined 
for all such non-degenerate paths. Then we define the index function of any path 
Y E P~,w (2n) to be the index of a suitable perturbation path f3 E P;,w (2n) of y. In 
the next chapter, we shall prove that this index of y is actually the minimum of those 
of the nearby OJ-non-degenerate paths. Specially this index function theory assigns 
two integers (iw(y), vw(Y) to any path y E P r (2n) for each OJ E U. 
To make the concept of this homotopy classification for these paths become precise, 
we need the following definitions introduced in [LonS] and [LonI6]. 
Definition 1 For any i > 0, y E Pr (2n), and OJ E U, using Definition 1.8.1 we 
define 
vw(y) = Vw(Y(i)) = dime kercCY(i) -
OJ/). 
(3) 
A path y E P r (2n) is called OJ-degenerate if vw(y) > 0, otherwise it is called 
OJ-non-degenerate. 
Definition 2 Given two curves 1/fo and 1/f1 E C([a, b), Sp(2n)) with 1/fo(a) = 1/fl (a) 
and 1/fo(b) = 1/f1 (b), if there is a map 8 E C([O, 1] x [a, b), Sp(2n)) such that 
8(0, .) = 1/foO, 8(1, .) = 1/f1(')' 8(s, a) = 1/fo(a), and 8(s, b) = 1/fo(b), then 1/fo and 
1/f1 are homotopic on [a, b) with fixed end points and we write 1/fo ~ 1/f1 on [a, b) 
with fixed end points. 
Definition 3 For i > 0 and OJ E U, given two paths YO and Y1 E P r (2n), if there 
exists a map 8 E C([O, 1] x [0, i), Sp(2n)) such that 8(0, .) = yoO, 8(1, .) = Yl (.), 
8(s,0) = I, and vw(8(s, .)) is constant for 0 ::::; s ::::; 1, then YO and Y1 are OJ-homotopic 
on [0, i) along 8(·, i) and we write YO ~w YI. If Yo ~w YI on [0, i) along 8(·, i) 

112 
5 Index functions for symplectic paths 
for all WE V, then YO and YI are V-homotopic on [0, r] along 8(·, r) and we write 
YO ~ YI· 
In the following Section 1, we establish the index function theory for paths in 
Sp(2) based on the R3-cylindrical coordinate representation of Sp(2) introduced in 
Section 2.1. This study yields a beautiful intuitive model for the higher dimensional 
case. Then we establish the index function theory for any non-degenerate path in 
Sp(2n) and introduce two families of standard paths in Section 2 based on the topo-
logical properties of Sp(2n) and its subsets studied in Chapter 2. In Section 3, we 
study basic properties of the index function for non-degenerate paths. In Section 4, 
we study perturbations of degenerate paths and define the index function theory for 
degenerate symplectic paths. 
5.1 
Paths in Sp(2) 
Fix r > O. In this section, we give two methods to define an index function theory 
parametrized by W E V for elements in P; w(2). The first method is completely 
elementary based on the homotopy classification of P; (2). In the second method we 
use the concept of intersection numbers in the algebraic topology. These two methods 
view the index function theory from different angles. 
We also have two ways to define the index function for degenerate paths. In the 
first method, we perturb degenerate paths to non-degenerate paths, and then use them 
to define the index functions. In the second method, we use a max-min argument on 
non-degenerate paths in any neighborhood of a given degenerate path to define the 
index functions for elements in P~,w(2). 
All these methods are strongly based on our R3-cylindrical coordinate repre-
sentation of Sp(2) introduced in Section 2.1. This coordinate transformation yields 
a COO-diffeomorphism from Sp(2) to R3 \ {z-axis}, All the considerations in 
this section should be understood under this diffeomorphism without further 
explanations. 
Non-degenerate Method 1. The homotopy classification method. 
For any r > 0 and k E Z we define a sequence of zigzag standard paths ak in 
P; (2) as follows. Set 
<Pr,O(t) = R (8';') 
V 
t E [0, r], 8

ao(t) = D(1 + tfr) == ~+(t), 
V t E [0, r]. 
For 0 :s t :s 1 we define 
ak(t) = [D(2)<Pr,krr] * ~+(t), 
Then ak E P r (2) and satisfies 
if k E Z\{O}.

5.1 Paths in Sp(2) 
113 
For any YEP, (2) and t E [0, r], we denote by 61 = 61 (t) a real function satisfying 
(2.1.1) in the polar decomposition of y(t). Because this decomposition is uniquely 
determined by y(t) as proved by Lemma 1.1.3, we can choose this function e(t) to 
be continuous. We define 
ll,(y) = e(r) - 61(0) . 
(5) 
Note that here the function e(t) can be replaced by ek(t) = e(t) + 2krc for any k E Z, 
and this exhausts all continuous real functions satisfying (2.1.1) with M = y(t) for 
all t E [0, r]. The important point here is that the function ll, : P,(2) -+ R is 
continuous and independent of the choice of k E Z. 
For any W E U and every YEP; cv (2), by our study in Section 2.1, we can connect 
y(r) to Mt = D(2) or Mi = D( ~2) by a path f3 within Sp(2):. Let 
k= 1l,(f3*y). 
rc 
Then we have k E Z and y ~w ak in the sense of Definition 0.3. Note that this 
k is uniquely determined by y. This yields a homotopy classification of elements 
in P;,w(2) and every such homotopy class contains one and only one path ak. An 
illustration of this study is given in Figure 1.

Non-degenerate Method 2. The intersection number method. 
This definition needs certain terminology from algebraic topology which we refer 
to classical books on the topics without further explanations.

Index functions for symplectic paths 
Fix W E U. In Section 2.1, an orientation of Sp(2)~ is defined. Therefore Sp(2)~ 
fonn a locally finite 2-dimensional singular homological cycle (cf. Lefshetz [Lefl]). 
For any r > ° 
and path f3 E P r (2) denote trl(t) = f3(r - t) for t E [0, r). 
Definition 2 We define 
(7) 
For any path y E P;,w(2) the two end points of the joint path y * ~.+l are not 
located on Sp(2)~. Thus the algebraic homological intersection number in (7) is well 
defined. 
To further explain this definition, fixing an W E U, we consider the smooth paths 
first. Let cp E C \[0, r], Sp(2» such that cp(O) = D(2) and cp( r) E Sp(2)~. Then 
the direction of cp at the point cp(t) is defined to be the tangent direction ¢(t) of cp at 
that point. Now we assume the following conditions on cpo 
(11) It holds that 
cp([O, r]) n Sp(2)~ c cp([O, r]) n Mw(2) == Sew, cp). 
(8) 
(12) cpintersectsMw (2)transversally,i.e.,atanyintersectionpointcp(t) E Sew, cp), 
the tangent vector of cp at the point cp(t) is not contained in the tangent plane 
of Mw(2) at the same point, i.e., ¢(t) . 1J(w, cp(t» =F 0, where 1J(w, x) is the 
positively directed unit nonnal vector of Mw(2) at its point X. 
Denote by Ci,reg(2) the set of all such C l curves satisfying (11) and (12), and 
call them the regular curves in Sp(2). Under these two conditions, we define the 
intersection number f.1,(cp, M w(2), x) of cp and Mw(2) at cp(t) E Sew, cp) by 
f.1,(cp, M, cp(t» = 1, 
f.1,(cp, M, cp(t» = -1, 
if ¢(t) . 1J(w, cp(t» > 0, 
if ¢(t) . 1J(w, cp(t» < O. 
Then the intersection number of cp and Sp(2)~ is defined by 
[Sp(2)~ : cp) = L 
f.1,(cp, M, x), 
v cp E C~,reg(2). 
XES(W,rp) 
This definition is also illustrated in Figure 1. 
(9) 
(10) 
(11) 
Define by ci (2) the set of paths in C\[O, r), Sp(2» started from D(2). Let 
Ci,reg(2, D(2» = Ci(2) n Ci,reg(2). Now fix a path y E Pr (2). We consider 
the CD-approximations cp E Ci,reg(2, D(2» of y * ~.+l satisfying cp(r) = y(r). It 
is easy to see that if cp is sufficiently CD-close to y * ~.+l, the intersection number 
[Sp(2)~ : cp) is independent of the particular choices of cpo Therefore we obtain 
[Sp(2)~ : y * ~.+ I) = [Sp(2)~ : cp), 
(12) 
for all such smooth CO -approximations of y * ~.+ I. Thus Definition 2 is well defined. 

5.1 Paths in Sp(2) 
115 
Note that the indices defined by the above two methods are homotopy invariant, 
i.e., for any (J) E D, Yo and Yl E P r (2), YO ~w Yl implies 
and they take the same values on ak. Therefore the indices defined by the above two 
methods coincide completely on every element in P; w(2). 
Next we give two methods to define the index functions for degenerate symplectic 
paths. 
Degenerate Method 1. The perturbation method. 
Fix r > 0 and (J) E D. Let y E P~,w(2). We define a family of nearby non-
degenerate paths for y by perturbations: 
ys(t) = y(t)R(sp(t)()), 
"It E[O,r], sE[-I,I], 
(13) 
where p E C1([0, r], R) satisfies pet) = 0 for 00 and 0 < pet) < 1 for to < t :s r 
with some to E (0, r), and per) = 1. We choose () > 0 to be so small and to > 0 
to be so close to r such that Ys E P; w(2) for all s E [-1, 1] \ to}. Then from our 
discussion in Section 2.1, we obtain ' 
"Iss' > 0, s, s' E [-1, 1], 
for all {3 E P;,w(2) sufficiently close to y in P r (2n). 
Definition 3 For any y E P~,w(2), we define 
Degenerate Method 2. The minimizing method. 
(14) 
(15) 
(16) 
(17) 
We define the index functions for any degenerate path by those of its nearby non-
degenerate paths. 
Definition 4 For any r > 0, (J) E D, and y E P~,w(2), we define 
iw(y) = 
sup inf{iw({3) I {3 E un P; w(2)}, 
UEN(y) 
, 
(18) 
where N(y) is the set of all open neighborhoods of y in Pr (2n). 

116

Index functions for symplectic paths 
Note that by the definition (13) of y-s, for any U E N(y) there is at least an 
s E (0, 1] such that y-s E U. Therefore the right-hand side of (18) is not greater than 
thatof(17). By (14)-(16), it is clear that there is a U E N(y) such that 
is not less than the right-hand side of (17). Therefore Definitions 3 and 4 coincide. 
In such a way, for any r > 0, W E U and y E Pr (2), a pair of integers 
(iw(Y), vw(Y)) E Z x to, 1, 2} 
is defined and is called the index function of y. 
Note that the topological structures of Sp(2), Sp(2)~, and Sp(2)~ used in this def-
inition are those contained in Sections 2.1 to 2.4. This observation is very suggestive 
for our study on paths in the higher dimensional symplectic groups. In the follow-
ing sections, we shall extend the above Non-degenerate Method 1 and Degenerate 
Method 1 to define the index function theory for paths in the symplectic group Sp(2n) 
for any n EN. 
5.2 Non-degenerate paths in Sp(2n) 
In this section we define the index function theory parametrized by W E U for any 
non-degenerate path in the symplectic group Sp(2n) with n 2: 1. 
By Lemmas 1.1.3, 1.1.5, and our discussion before Lemma 2.4.5, for any M E 
Sp(2n), we denote by 
U(M) = (Ul(M) 
u2(M) 
-U2(M)) 
ul(M) 
the orthogonal and symplectic part of its unique polar decomposition. Then U (M) = 
Ul (M) + RU2(M) E U(n, C). So in such a way, for every path y E Pr (2n) we 
can uniquely associate to it a path, 
Uy(t) = u(y(t)), 
'lit E [0, r], 
in the unitary group U(n, C). 
Lemmal1° Foranyy E C([0,r],Sp(2n)), let~: [O,r] --+ Rbeanycontinuous 
real function satisfying 
detuy(t) = exp(.J=l~(t)),

We define the rotation number of Y by 
~,(y) = ~(r) -
~(O). 
(2) 
For 0:::; a < b :::; r, we also define 
~[a,bl(Y) = ~(b) -
~(a). 
(3) 
Then ~,(y) and ~[a,bl(Y) depend only on Y but not on the choice of the 
function ~ satisfying (1). 
2° For Y E C([O, r], Sp(2n) n O(2n)) n P,(2n), the function Pn defined by 
(2.4.7) satisfies 
Pn(y(t)) = exp(.J=1~(t)), 
"It E [0, r]; 
the function .3., defined by (2.4.25) and the above function ~, satisfy 
.3.,(y) = ~,(y).

Proof: Let ~' : [0, r] ---+ R be another continuous real function satisfying (1). 
By (1), for every t E [0, r] there exists k(t) E Z such that ~(t) -
~I(t) = 27rk(t). 
Since both ~ and ~' are continuous, so is the function k. Since k is integer valued, 
by the connectedness of the interval [0, r], k must be constant. Thus the first conclu-
sion in 1° holds. (4) and (5) follow from Lemma 2.4.5 and (1).3° follows from the 
definition (1).

The following lemma studies the relation between the usual homotopy and the 
homotopy which fixes the end points. 
Lemma 2 Let W E U. Suppose Yo and Yl E P,(2n) possess common end point 
yo(r) = Yl(r). Suppose Yo ~w Yl on [0, r] in the sense of Definition 0.3 via a 
homotopy 8 : [0,1] x [0, r] ---+ Sp(2n) such that 8(·, r) is contractible in Sp(2n). 
Then the homotopy 8 can be modified to fix the end points all the time, i.e., 8(s, r) = 
Yo(r) for all ° 
:::; s :::; 1. 
Proof: Without loss of generality, suppose r = 1. By the assumption of the lemma, 
~ == 8(·, 1) is a contractible curve in Sp(2n), i.e., there is a homotopy map ct 
which shrinks ~ to some M E Sp(2n) within Sp(2n). Since Sp(2n) is path con-
nected, without loss of generality, we suppose M = Yo(1) = YI (1). Therefore

a E C([O, 1]2, Sp(2n)) satisfies £l(O, t) = ~(t), £l(l, t) = £l(s, 0) = £l(s, 1) = M 
for (s , t) E [0,1]2. For (s, t) E [0, 1]2, define (cf. Figure 2 for the definition of (3) 
YO(I~2s)'

(8) 
Then f3 E C([O, 1]2, Sp(2n)) gives the homotopy from YO to YI which fixes the end 
points all the time. 
0 
By the same argument we obtain the following lemma. We omit its proof here. 
Lemma 3 Suppose Yo and YI E C([O, r], Sp(2n) n O(2n» possess common end 
points Yo(O) = YI (0) and Yo(r) = YI (r). Suppose Yo ~ YI on [0, r] in the sense of 
Definition 0.2 via a homotopy 8 : [0,1] x [0, r] -+ Sp(2n) n O(2n) such that 8(·, t) 
with t = 0 and t = r are contractible in Sp(2n) n O(2n). Then the homotopy 8 can 
be modified to fix the end points all the time, i.e., 8(s, r) = Yo(r) for all 0 S s S 1. 
Lemma 4 If Yo and YI E P,(2n) possess common endpoint Yo(r) = YI(r), then

5.2 Non-degenerate paths in Sp(2n) 
119 
Using the polar decomposition of symplectic matrices, for any M = AU E Sp(2n) 
with A E PSS(2n) and U E Sp(2n) n O(2n) (cf. Sections 1.1 and 2.2), there is a 
curve 1) E C([O, 1], PSS(2n» satisfying 1)(0) = A and 1)(1) = I. Especially for any 
t E [0, 1], all the eigenvalues of 1)(t) are real. Thus by the definition (2.4.7) of the 
function Pn, we have Pn(1)(t» = I or -1. Since Pn(l) = 1, and both Pn and 1) are 
continuous, we get Pn (1)(t» = 1 for all t E [0, 1]. Therefore by Lemma 2.4.7 the 
curve 1) is contractible in Sp(2n), and so is the curve 1) (.) U. 
Similarly by the polar decomposition, each path Yi uniquely determines a path 
f3i : [0, 1] --+ Sp(2n) n 0 (2n) by shrinking the positive definite symmetric symplectic 
part of the matrix Yi (t) for t E [0, 1] and i = 0, I to the identity matrix. Note that this 
shrinking is continuous by Lemma 1.1.3. This yields two homotopies Oi : [0, 1] --+ 
PI (2n) such that Oi (0) = Yi, Oi (1) = f3i for i = 0, 1. Especially by our discussion 
in the previous paragraph, the curve (010(1»-1 * 000(1) : [0, 1] --+ Sp(2n) is 
contractible in Sp(2n). 
We claim that Yo ~w YI with fixed end points if and only if f30 ~w f31 with fixed 
end points in the sense of Definition 0.3. 
In fact, for the necessity of the claim, suppose f30 ~ 
w f31 with fixed end points via 
a homotopy 1). Then (01)- 1 * 1) * Do yields a homotopy ~ from Yo to YI with ~(" 1) 
being contractible in Sp(2n) by our above discussion. Thus by Lemma 3, Yo ~w YI. 
By a similar argument, we get the sufficiency of the claim. 
Note that by definition of ~(t) in (1), 
for i = 0, 1. 
Thus it suffices to prove that ~1 (f30) = ~ I (f3d if and only if f30 ~ 
w f31 on [0, 1] with 
fixed end points in Sp(2n). 
By Theorem 2.2.1, especially (2.2.4), f30 ~w f31 on [0,1] with fixed end points if 
and only if f3 == f311 * f30 is contractible in Sp(2n). By Lemma 2.4.7, the latter holds 
if and only if Pn 0 f3 : [0, 1] --+ U is contractible in U. Fix a function ~(t) satisfying 
(1). By Lemma 1 and the fact f3([0, 1]) c Sp(2n) n O(2n), we obtain ~I = 3.1 
defined by (2.4.26) and that Pn 0 f3 is a loop in U, and 
for some k E Z. Note that by Lemma 2.4.7, Pn 0 f3 is contractible in U if and only if 
k = 0, i.e., ~I (f30) = ~I (f31). This proves the lemma. 
0 
By the same argument of Lemma 4, we obtain 
Lemma 5 For any two continuous curves ljIo and ljIl : [0, T] --+ Sp(2n) with ljIo(O) = 
ljIl (0) and ljIo( T) = ljIl (T), there exist continuous functions ~ 0 and ~ I : [0, T] --+ R 
satisfying (1) determined by the curves ljIo and ljIl respectively. Then ljIo ~ ljIl on 
[0, T] with fixed end points in the sense of Definition 0.2 if and only if ~~ (ljIo) = 
~~(ljId, where ~~(ljIi) = ~i(T) -
~i(O)fori = 0, 1 respectively. 
For any (j) E U and YEP; w(2n), by Theorem 2.4.1 we can connect yeT) to M;i 
or M;; by a path f3 : [0, T] --+' Sp(2n)~.

k == 1:!.r;(fJ * y)/rr. 
Then k is an integer, is independent of the choice of the path fJ, and 
{ k

k

We denote by P:,w (2n) the set of all such paths in P;,w (2n), that possess the 
property (9). 
Proof: By the definition of M:!=, k is an integer and (10) holds. Now we connect Y(T) 
to fJ(T) by another curve fJ' : [0, T] --* Sp(2n):. Since Sp(2n): is simply connected 
in Sp(2n) by Theorem 2.4.2, we obtain fJ "-' w fJ' on [0, T] with fixed points in the 
sense of Definition 0.3. Therefore by Lemmas 1 and 4 we obtain 
This proves the lemma.

The following Theorem 2 on the symplectic additivity of the index theory is believed 
and used in many papers such as [CoZ2], [LZel], [LonS], and [DoLl] etc. A rigorous 
proof was given in [Lon13] which we use here. 
Theorem 2 For OJ E U, suppose Yj E P;,w (2n j ) for j = ° 
and 1. Then YOOYI E 
P;,w (2no + 2n 1) and 
iw(Yooyd = iw(Yo) + iw(YI), 
where YOOYI (t) = YO(t)OYI (t)for all t E [0, r). 
(2) 
Proof: Without loss of generality we suppose r = 1. Let n = no + n 1. For i = ° 
and 1, choose paths f3i : [0, r] -+ Sp(2ni): to connect Yi(r) to M;;; or M~ respec-
tively. Note that 
Then we obtain 
!~q (f3o * YO) /n + ~ 1 (f31 * yd /n 
iw(Yloyo). 
Suppose f3o(l) = M~ and f31 (1) = M~. We define a path 
7](t) = (M~oM~)[R(tn)olzno-2oR(tn)olznl-2]' 
VO:::: t:::: 1. 
(3) 
Then 7] connects M~ 
oM~ to M;; within Sp(2n):. Note that ~1 (7]) = 0. Thus we 
obtain 
~1 (7] * [f3oof3IJ * [Yooyl1)/n 
~1(7])/n + ~1(f3o * Yo)/n + ~1(f31 * yd/n 
iw(Yo) + iw(Yl)' 
Other cases of the values of f30 (1) and f31 (1) can be proved similarly. The details are 
left to the readers.

Theorem 3 Let OJ E U and r > 0. !fyO and YI E P; w(2n), then iw(Yo) = iw(yJ) if 
and only if YO ~w Yl on [0, r). Therefore P: w(2n) with k E Z defined by Lemma 2.6 
give a complete homotopy classification orp; w(2n). 
Proof: Connecting Yi(r) to M;; or M; by a path f3i : [0, r] -+ Sp(2n)* for i = ° 
and 1, we have 
on [0, r] 
along 
f3i, 
(4) 
(5) 
for i = ° 
and 1. Thus Yo ~w Yl if and only if f30 * YO ~w f31 * Yl· Since iw(f3o * YO) = 
iw(f31 * Yl) if and only if ~r(f3o * YO) = ~r(f31 * YI), which especially implies 
f3o(r) = f31 (r). Therefore the proof is complete by Lemma 2.4.

5 Index functions for symplectic paths 
Next we define a family of standard smooth paths {fikl in P,(2n) which was 
introduced by E. Zehnder and the author in [LZel] to simplify the computations. 
Note that the end point of each path fik is M;; or M;;. Each fik is the fundamental 
solution of a linear Hamiltonian system 
y = JB(t)y 
(6) 
with B(t) given by 
A

Bk(t) = -J fh(t)f3f; (t). 
(7) 
Here and in the rest of this section, we always assume t E [0, r]. We define these fikS 
in two cases according to n = 1 and n ::=: 2. 
Case n = 1: Define w(t) = ! (l + cos(2n f)), and 
WI (t) = { ~(t)

~:'St:'Sr, 
W2(t) = { ~(t) 
O:'StS~, 
~:'St:'Sr. 
Denote K = (~ ~ ). We define 
fio(t) = D(2t/,), 
Eo = (ln2)K. 
If k E 2Z + 1, we define 
A

fh{t) = R ~ , 
Ek = kJr I. 
If k E 2Z\ {OJ, we define

Case n ::=: 2: Define n x n matrices 
Xk = diag(O, (k - n + 2)n, n, ... , n), 
Y = diag(ln 2,0, ... , 0), 
Zk = diag«k - n + l)n, n, ... , n). 
Let 0 denote the zero matrix.

If (_l)n+k = -1, i.e., n and k possess different parities, we define 
(12) 
(13) 
If ( -1 )n+k = 1, i.e., nand k possess the same parities, we define 
(14) 
(15) 
We also define a family of standard zigzag paths ak as follows. Using paths 
defined in (1.2) and (1.3), we define 
(16) 
Then for any (J) E U and k E Z, we have ak E P;,w (2n) and 
(18) 
if (-I)k=±1. 
(19) 
The following proposition is obtained by direct computations. 
Proposition 4 For any (J) E U, r > 0, and k E Z, it holds that ab ~k E P~ w(2n), 
~k is C l , and ih E C(Sr , .cs(R2n )) with S, = R/(rZ). 
Equivalently, Theorem 3 shows that for every y E P;,w(2n) there is one and only 
one k E Z such that y '" ak. This can also be used to give the definition of iw on 
P;,w(2n) as in Section 2 to replace Definition 2.7. 
5.4 Perturbations of degenerate paths 
For (J) E U and r > 0, fix ayE P~ w(2n). We apply Theorem 1.7.3 and

Note that the matrix P and the normal form o-product N in (1) of yeT) need not 
be uniquely determined by the matrix y. The path Ys depends not only on y (T) but 
also on the choices of P and N. Nevertheless in the later sections we shall see that 
iw(Ys) for any s i= 0 is uniquely determined by y. 
The following is the most important property of these rotational perturbation paths. 
Theorem 1 ([LonS], [Lon13], [Lon16]). For any W E U, T > 0, y E P~ w (2n), and 
o < s ::: 1, the rotational perturbation paths defined by (6) satisfy 
(8) 
Proof: Without loss of generality, we assume T = 1. Fix s E (0, 1]. For 0 ::: k ::: 
p + 2q define 
ak(t) 
y(t)P- 1 RmJ (sp(t)eo)'" Rmk(sp(t)eo) 
Rmk+\ (-sp(t)eo)'" Rmp+2q (-sp(t)eo)P. 
Then by definition, we have ak E P{ ±(2n) for 0 ::: k ::: p + 2q, and ao = y-s, 
a p+2q = Ys. 
In Figure 1, the case of p + 2q = 2 with three paths ao, ai, and a2 are shown. The 
dark curves describe intuitively a part of the singular hypersurface Sp(2n )~. 
Figure 1: 
The case of p + 2q = 2 with paths ao, al. and a2 
For 1 ::: k ::: p + 2q, define 
ak = vw(ak(1)P- 1Rmk (-seo)p). 
By (5), the constant ak only takes the value 1 or 2. By the properties of normal forms, 
especially Remark 1.8.7, we obtain 
p+2q 
p+2q 
vw(Y) = L vw(ak(I)P- 1Rmk (-seo)p) = L ak·

Assume the following equalities hold, 
iu,(ak) - iw(ak-d = at, 
for 1 :s k :s p + 2q. 
Summing (10) up from k = 1 to k = p + 2q yields 
p+2q 
iw(Ys) - iw(y-s) = iw(ap+2q) - iw(ao) = L ak = vw(Y)· 
k=l 
Therefore the proof of (8) is reduced to that of (10). 
(10) 
Fix a k E {I, ... ,p + 2q}. Let 7](t) = ak-l(1)p-l Rmk (2ts(}o)P for t E 
[0, 1]. Then by definition we have 7](0) = ak-l (1), 7](1) = ak(I), 7](1/2) = 
ak(I)p-l Rmk(-s(}o)P E Sp(2n)~, vw(7](1/2» = ak, and 7](t) E Sp(2n)~ for 
t E [0,1] \ {I/2}. Note that B€(y(I» is contractible if E > 0 is small enough. 
By (5) and (7) we obtain that ak I[to.l] is homotopic to the joint path of ak-ll[to.l] 
and 7] with fixed end points in the sense of Definition 0.2. Therefore we obtain 
ak '" 7] * ak-l with fixed end points in the sense of Definition 0.3 (cf. Figure 2). 
Then (10) becomes 
iw(7] * ak-d - iw(ak-d = ak· 
The proof of ( 11) contains two cases according to the value of ak. 
Figure 2: 
The case of ak ~ T/ * ak-l 
Case 1 ak = 2. 
We notice that vw(7](I/2» = ak = 2 and 
7] * ak-l(t) = 7](I/2)P- l Rmk«t - 3/4)4s(}o)P 
for 1/2 :s t :s 1. For 0 < It - 3/41 :s 1/4, we get 
(11)

Hence from Theorem 2.6.3, when 0 < 8 < 2n, 1](l/2)P-1 Rmk (8)P belongs to the 
same path connected component of Sp(2n)~. For the new paths constructed below 
in the proof of this case, we refer to Figure 3. 
Therefore we get 
1] * <Yk-l ~ fJ * <Yk-l, 
(12) 
wherefJ(t) = <Yk-l(l)P-1Rmk C2tn)PforO S t S 1. By the discussion at the end of 
Section 3, we get <Yk-l ~ a j for some zigzag standard path a j defined there. So there 
exists a path ~ E C([O, 1], Sp(2n)~) such that ~(O) = aj(l) and ~(l) = <Yk-l(l) 
hold. Thus <Yk-l ~ ~ * aj and 
fJ*<Yk-l ~ fJ*~*aj ~ ~-l*fJ*~*aj == ~ 
hold. Here because fJ * (~ * a j) ~ (fJ * ~) * a j, we simply use the notation fJ * ~ * a j .

Choose a path g E PI (2n) such that g (l) = P. Define

Vs, t E [0, 1]. 
This gives a homotopy from the path ho to hI = fJ in Sp(2n) with fixed end points. 
Therefore by Lemma 2.5 and a direct computation, we obtain 
/}.l (fJ) = /}.I (ho) = 2n. 
Thus by a further direct computation on smooth standard paths, we obtain ~ (1) = 
aj(1) = aJ+2(1) and 
/}.l(n = /}.ICaj) + /}.1(fJ) = (j + 2)n = /}.1(aj+2). 
Then from Lemma 2.4, we get that ~

1] * <Yk-l ~ aj+2, and hence by Theorem 3.3, 
iw(1] * <Yk-I) -
iw(<Yk-l) = iw(aJ+2) - iw(aj) = 2. 
Thus (11) holds in this case.

If n = 1, the equality (11) follows from the Definitions 1.1 and 1.3, and the

The proof of Theorem 1 is complete.

Based upon our rotational perturbation paths, the index function for degenerate 
symplectic paths can be defined as follows. 
Definition 2 ([LonS], [Lon13], [Lon16]). For any r > 0, (V E U, and y E P~.w(2n), 
define 
v s E (0, 1], 
(15) 
where y-s is the rotational perturbation path of y defined by (6). 

130 
5 Index functions for symplectic paths 
We shall prove in the next chapter that Definition 2 is well defined, i.e. the index 
iw (Y) of (15) depends only on Y and w. 
Definition 3 For any WE U, r > 0, and Y E Pr (2n), Definitions 0.1, 2.7, and the 
above Definition 2 assign a pair of integers 
(iw(Y), vw(Y» E Z x {O, 1, ... , 2n} 
to y, which we call the index function of Y at w. We also call iw(Y) the w-index of 
Y, and vw(Y) the w-nullity of y. 
Definition 4 For r > 0, let B E C(R/(rZ), L s(R2n». By Corollary 3.1.4, the 
fundamental solution YB of the linear Hamiltonian system 
x(t) = J B(t)x(t) 
(16) 
satisfies YB E Pr (2n), and is called the associated symplectic path of B. Forw E U, 
we define the index function of B via that of YB: 
(17) 
As usual, eigenvalues of YB(r) are called Floquet multipliers of the system (16) 
(or B). 
Let H E C1 (R/(rZ) x R2n, R). Suppose x is a r-periodic solution of the 
Hamiltonian system 
x(t) = J H' (t, x(t», 
(18) 
such that His C2 along the orbit x(R) of x. The associated symplectic path of x is 
defined to be the fundamental solution Yx == YB of the linearized Hamiltonian system 
(16) with B(t) = H" (t, x(t» for all t. For w E U, we define the index function of x 
via that of its associated symplectic path Yx: 
(19) 
As usual, eigenvalues of Yx (r) are called Floquet multipliers of the solution x of the 
system (18). 
Remark 5 In this chapter we have used the method of [CoZ2], [LZeI], [Lon5], 
[Lon13], and [LonI6] to define the index function theory. Such a method is completely 
topological. Note that in [SaZI] and [SaZ2] such an index theory was also defined 
for I-non-degenerate paths in Pr (2n). But there, instead of the function Ll(t) and 
Llr(y) defined in Lemma 2.1, the authors used the function '&(t) and '&r(Y) defined 
by (2.4.25) and (2.4.26). 

5.4 Perturbations of degenerate paths 
131 
Other ways of defining this index theory can be found in [ZhLl] and [LZul], where 
the spectral flow method was used. We also refer to [RoS2] for other index theories 
with a different index for degenerate paths via the spectral method. In [LZu2], it 
was proved that Sp(2n)~ for any Q) E U is a codimension 1 oriented cycle, and it 
induces a topological intersection number definition of this index theory. Compared 
with these different methods, the method described in this book is rather elementary 
and intuitive. 

Chapter 6 
Properties of index functions 
In this chapter, we study basic properties of the index function theory for elements 
in P,(2n) defined in Chapter 5, study its relation with the Morse indices of the 
reduced functional of corresponding linear Hamiltonian systems, and derive its axiom 
characterization. These results form the basis for our later study of the iteration theory 
and Morse theoretical applications to nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. 
6.1 
Index functions and Morse indices 
Let W E U. We consider the boundary value problem of the linear Hamiltonian 
system 
y(t) = I B(t)y(t), 
y(r) = wy(O), 
(1) 
(2) 
with B E C(S" .cs(R2n» and S, = R/(rZ) with r > O. By Corollary 3.1.4, the 
fundamental solution YB of the system (1) belongs to P,(2n). Thus we can define 
the index function of the problem (1)-(2) by that of YB: 
(3) 
In this section we study the relationship between the index function of the boundary 
value problem (1 )-(2) and the Morse indices of the corresponding functionals defined 
on the truncated loop space. For this purpose, we define 
P,(2n) = {y E C'([O, r], Sp(2n» I y(O) = J, y(1) = y(O)y(I)}, 
(4) 
P;(2n) = P,(2n) n P;(2n), 
P?(2n) = P,(2n)\P;(2n). 
(5) 
Note that B = -ly(-)y-'(-) E C(S" .cs(R2n» if and only if y E P,(2n), i.e., the 
path family p, (2n) is formed by fundamental solutions of all the linear Hamiltonian 
systems (1) with continuous symmetric and r-periodic coefficients. The topology of 
P;(2n) is the C'([O, r], Sp(2n»-topology induced from that of Sp(2n). Note that 
Pr:(2n) is dense in p,(2n). 
For r > 0, define L to be the Hilbert space L2([0, r], C2n ) with the usual L2 inner

and W = W 1,2 (Sr, C 2n ) as a subspace of L, where (., .) is the inner product of C 2n . 
For w = exp(e,J=I) E U, define WW to be the subspace {y E WI yet) = wy(O)}

Then solutions of (1)-(2) are in one to one correspondence with critical points of the

Then fw : Ww ---* R is smooth in the topology of L.

the proof for the case of w = 1 in Theorem 1, and leave other cases to the readers. 
When w = 1, the boundary condition (2) becomes 
yer) = yeO). 
(15) 
We then work on real spaces L = L 2(Sr, R2n) and W = WI•2(Sr, R 2n ). Using 
the inner product a . b in R 2n to replace (., .) in C2n in the above notation, we get 
the corresponding operators and functionals. Note that the Hamiltonian function 
corresponding to (1) is 
1 
H(t, x) = "2B(t)x . x 
v (I,x) E R x R2n. 
(16) 
It satisfies the condition (HI) and (H3) in Section 4.2. For simplicity, in the following 
we omit all the sub and sup indices for w = 1, and simply write f, Z, a, u : Z --+ W, 
and 2d = dim Z, etc. 
The proof of this theorem is rather long, and is completed by the following sequence 
of lemmas. Without loss of generality, we suppose r = 1 in the remainder of this 
section. We start from the basic properties of the operator A - B. 
Lemma 2 10 The operator A - B defined on domA is linear self-adjoint, has compact 
resolution, and then its spectrum is a point spectrum, i.e., a(A - B) = a p 
(A - B). 
20 0 E a (A - B) if and only if VI (B) > O. The multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 
of A - B is precisely VI (B). When VI (B) = 0, the operator A - B possesses 
a bounded inverse. 

6.1 1ndex functions and Morse indices 
135 
3° 1f B(t) == B is independent of time t, the operator B defined by (10) is 
commutative with the projection map P : L -+ Z defined by (4.3.2). 
Proof: 1 ° and 3° follow from the definitions of A, B, and P. Suppose K is the kernal 
of A - B. Then x E K is equivalent to the fact that x is a I-periodic solution of (1). 
Thus the total multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 of the operator A - B is precisely the 
dimension of the I-periodic solution space of the system (1). By the Floquet theory 
(cf. [CoLI]) this dimension is precisely VI (B). This proves 2°. 
D 
Lemma 3 Let B E C([O, 1] x Sr, .Ls(R2n» and denote by BsO = B(s, .). Denote 
the Morse indices of the functional as on Z corresponding to the system (1) with 
B(t) == Bs at z = 0 by m-;, m~, and mi, where Z and as : Z -+ Rare the finite 
dimensional space with large enough dimension dim Z = 2d and the functional on 
Z obtained by the saddle point reduction method for all s E [0, 1] with the same Z. 
Suppose 
\:Is E [0, 1]. 
(17) 
Then 
m; = mo' m; = mt, 
\:Is E [0, 1].

Proof: Fix any r E [0, 1]. For any s E [0, 1] that is sufficiently close to r, we obtain

This proves that m-; and mi are locally constants. By the connectedness of [0, 1], 
they are also globally constants, i.e., (18) holds. 
D 
Remark 4 Lemma 3 and Theorem 1 give the analytical meaning of our concept of 
homotopy in Definition 5.0.3, i.e., the homotopy allows the Hamiltonian systems to 
possess the same truncated Morse indices. 
Lemma 5 Suppose YO, YI E PI(2n), and Yo ~l YI. Then this homotopy can be 
realized in PI (2n). 
Proof: Denote the homotopy from Yo to YI in PI(2n) by 8 : [0,1]2 -+ Sp(2n). 
Near the segments {OJ x [0,1] and {l} x [0,1] in the square [0, If, pushing Yo and 
YI into [0, 1]2 along the direction perpendicular to these two segments, without loss 
of generality, we can assume that for some E E (0, 1/8),

Then this function is continuous on sand tin [0, 1]. For each s E [0, 1], we have that 
~s E CI([O, 1], [0,1]) is strictly increasing from ~s(cp(s)) = ° 
to ~s(1 - cp(s)) = 1, 
and satisfies ~s(cp(s)) = ~s(1 -
cp(s)) = 0. Now we define a new homotopy 1] 
(cf. Figure 1) as a reparametrization of 8 by 
1
8(S' (1 -

Note that the second arguments on the right-hand side of (19) as functions of t are 
C I , are continuous in s, and increase from ° 
to 1 as t increases from ° 
to 1 for each 
fixed s. Then 1] E C ([0, 1]2, Sp(2n)) gives a homotopy from YO to YI in PI (2n), 1] is 
C l in the variable t in an open neighborhood of the boundary of the square [0, 1]2, 
and 
~(s, 1) = ~(s, O)1](s, 1), 
Vs E [0, 1], 
where ~ is the derivative of 1] with respect to t. Thus 1] is not C I in the variable t at 
most on a compact subregion of (0,1)2. 
Now, following the standard differential topology argument (for example 
cf. [Hirl]), we can find an approximation s of 1] such that s coincides with 1] near 
the boundary of [0, 1]2, is C l in the variable t for all s E [0, 1], and can be chosen to 
be as close to 1] as we want. This map S gives a homotopy claimed by the lemma. 
Another argument to obtain the smoothness in t from 1] is to smooth out the gen-
erating function (cf. Section 3.2) corresponding to the symplectic matrices in the 
parameter t, and then obtain the map S claimed by the lemma.

Next under the assumption of Theorem 1, we consider the case of VI (B) = ° 
first, 
i.e., the non-degenerate case. 
Denote by Y the fundamental solution of the system (1). Then by definition il (y) = 
il (B) and VI (y) = VI (B) = 0. By the discussion of Section 5.3, there is a smooth

of the homotopy, y can be deformed to fi j in the non-degenerate path set p~ (2n) 
continuously. 
In Lemma 5, let YO = Y and Yl = fi j. Then we obtain a homotopy { : [0, 1]2 --+ 
Sp(2n) of y and fij in P~(2n). Define

Bs(t) = -f{(s, t)l; 
(s, t), 
'10 :s t :s 1. 
(20) 
Then by Corollary 3.1.4 we obtain Bs E C 1([0, 1], Ls(R2n)) and is continuous in 
s E [0,1]. Let Ys = {(s, .), which is the fundamental solution of (1) with B = Bs 
for each s E [0, I]. By Theorem 4.3.1, for 
1 
HAt, x) = "2Bs(t)x. x, 
V (t, x) E R X R2n, 
(21) 
we obtain the corresponding space Z, functionals fs, as, and the injection map Us 
for 0 :s s :s 1. Here we have used the compactness of the interval [0, 1] and the 
continuity of B s (t) to get a uniform finite dimensional space Z with sufficiently large 
dimension for all s E [0, 1]. Denote by m;, m~, and mi the Morse indices of Bs 
respectively. 
Lemma 6 Suppose VI (y) = O. Then in the above discussion, Z = 0 is an isolated 
critical point of as and 
m; = m+, 
m~ = mO = 0, 
m; = m-, 
V s E [0,1]. 
(22) 
Proof: Since Ys E P~(2n), by Theorem 4.4.1 we obtain 
m~ = dimker(Ys(l) -1) = VI (Ys) = 0, 
V s E [0, 1].

Properties of index functions 
By Corollary 3.1.4, Bs(t) is symmetric. By 2° of Lemma 2, the self-adjoint operator 
A - Bs possesses a bounded inverse operator. By the continuity of Bs in the parameter 
s and the compactness ofthe interval [0, 1], there exists a constant).. > 0 independent 
of s E [0,1] such that (A - Bs)-l E .c(L) and II (A - Bs)-lll S 1/)... Therefore 
Y u E domA, 0 S s S 1. 
Denote the injection map given by 5° of Theorem 4.3.1 by Us (z) = z + Vs (z), where 
PVs(z) = O. Define 
1 
as(Z) = 2((A -
Bs)us(z), Us(Z»)L 
Yz E Z. 
(24) 
Specifically, ao = a. 
From lIus(z)lIi = IIzlli + IIvs(z)lIi we have lIus(z)IIL 2: IIzIlL. Therefore we 
obtain 
OssSI. 
Thus z = 0 is an isolated critical point of as on Z for all s E [0, 1]. 
Now (22) follows from (23) and Lemma 3. 
D 
Lemma 6 reduces the study for the non-degenerate case to the study of the special 
smooth standard paths defined at the end of Section 5.3. A symplectic path is called 
an exponential path if it is of the form yet) = exp(t J B) for 0 S t S 1 with some 
B E .cs (2n). Such paths form a simpler subset of symplectic paths. 
Lemma 7 For any k E Z, denote by ml:, mZ, and mt the Morse indices of the 
functional ak corresponding to the smooth standard path ~k defined at the end of 
Section 5.3. Denote 2d = dim Z in the saddle point reduction. Then 
ml: =d+k, 
°-0 
mk -
, 
mt =d-k. 
(25) 
Proof: Fix k E Z. (23) in the proof of Lemma 6 implies mZ = O. Since the sum 
of these three Morse indices must be 2d, it suffices to compute mt. We continue our 
computations in two cases. 
Case 1 n = 1 and k ~ 2Z\ {O} or n 2: 2. 
In this case, the coefficient matrix function B(t) of the linear system (1) corre-
sponding to the smooth standard path ~k is a constant matrix B(t) == ih defined 
by (5.3.8), (5.3.13), or (5.3.15) respectively. In this case the Morse indices of the 
corresponding functional at the critical point z = 0 can be easily computed. Thus 
here we only compute the case of n 2: 2 and ( -1 )n+k = 1, i.e., the smooth standard 
paths defined by (5.3.14). All the verifications of other cases are left to the readers. 
By 4° of Theorem 4.3.1, 
Y z E Z. 

6.1 1ndexfunctions and Morse indices 
139 
Therefore on the space Z, 
a~(O) = A - ih. 
(26) 
According to the decomposition of the eigenvector subspaces of the operator A in 
Section 4.2, we can denote Z by 
(27) 
The space Eo = R2n is an invariant subspace of A - Bk, on which A - Bk has the 
form 
(28) 
It has eigenvalues A1 = -n < o with multiplicity 2(n -1), andA2 = -(k -n + l)n 
with multiplicity 2. Note that from k i= n - 1, we obtain A2 < 0 when k > n - 1, 
and A2 > 0 when k < n -
1. 
For m 2: 1, the space Em EB E_m is an invariant subspace of A - Bk. Denote 
Em EB E_m = {( = (cos2mTCt)~ + (sin2mnt)1) I~, 1) E R 2n }. 
(29) 
Then by direct computation, the operator A - Bk has the following form on this 
subspace, 
(30) 
where J.L = 2mn, ~ and 1) E R 2n. The above 4n x 4n matrix on each orthogonal 
subspace of Em EB E -m is a 4 x 4 matrix of the form 
(

a 
-J.L 
0 
o -J.L

a 
(31) 
Thus when a = -n, A3 = (2m -
1)n > 0 and A4 = -(2m + l)n < 0 are 
eigenvalues of A - Bk with multiplicity 2(n -
1). When a = -(k - n + 1)n, 
A5 = (-(k - n + 1) - 2m)n and A6 = (-(k - n + 1) + 2m)n are eigenvalues of 
A - Bk of multiplicity 2. When k 2: n, A5 < 0; if m < (k - n + 1)/2 then A6 < 0; 
if m > (k - n + 1)/2 then A6 > O. When k < n, A6 > 0; if m < -(k - n + 1)/2 
then A5 > 0; if m > -(k - n + 1)/2 then A5 < O.

Properties of index functions 
By these computations and the decomposition (27) of Z, when k :::: n we obtain

mt = L 2(n -

m=! 
d-n 
2n 
L 
2n =d-k. 
When k < n, similarly we obtain mt = k - n. This proves (25). 
Case2 n = 1 andk E 2Z\{0}. 
(32) 
In this case ih(t) is defined by (5.3.11), which is not a constant matrix. Note that 
by Lemma 2.11 below, there is no exponential paths in each subfamily Pf, I (2) when 
k E 2Z\ to}. Then in such a sense the smooth standard paths defined by (5.3.10) are 
the simplest ones in these homotopy classes. 
By (5.3.11), we define a new path y E P;(4) by 
y(t) = F(t)G(t), 
where F(t) = D(2WZ (t»)<>/z and G(t) = R(-WI(t)k1r)<>R(tn) for 0 :s t :s 1, 
where D(a) for a E R \ to} and R«()) for () E R are defined in Section 1.8. Then 
y(l) = Mt, and for 0 :s t :s 1 it holds that ~(t) = -WI (t)k1r + tJr. This yields 
~I(Y) = (k + l)n. Therefore 
(33) 
On the other hand, the path y is the fundamental solution of the system (1) with 
B(t) = [-(WI (t)k1r)/z + (an(t) In 2)K]<>(n /Z), 
fort E [O,r], where K is defined in (5.3.11). Let x = (XI,X2) == (xf,xJl, 
Y = (YI, Y2), and Z = (Xl, Yl, X2, Y2). Then corresponding to B(t) the quadratic 
form splits into 
(A -
B)u(z), U(Z))L = (A - Bk)U(X), U(X))L + (A - Bdy, Y)L, 
(34) 
where BJ is defined by (5.3.9). The base space corresponding to B on the left-hand 
side of (34) is R4. The base spaces corresponding to Bk and BI on the right-hand side 
of (34) are R2 respectively. Denote the positive Morse index of the left-hand side by 
m +. Then (34) yields 
m+ = mt + mt. 
(35) 
By the assumption of the lemma, the dimension of the truncated space Z according 
to Bk is 2d. Without loss of generality, we assume d has been chosen to be large 
enough so that it works for B!, Bk, and B simultaneously. Then the truncated spaces 
according to Bl and B have dimensions 2d and 4d respectively. Thus applying 
Lemma 6 and Case 1 of this lemma, we obtain 
2d - (k + 1) = mt + (d - 1). 
This proves (25) in Case 2 and completes the proof of the lemma.

6.11ndexfunctions and Morse indices 
141 
Combining the above two lemmas, we have proved Theorem 1 for the non-degenerate 
case. We give next 
The proof of Theorem 1 for (V = 1: Without loss of generality, we suppose T = 1. 
By Definition 5.4.2, it suffices to prove the following for s E (0, 1] when Vj (y) > 0: 
I 
m- = d + il(Y-s), 
mO = VI(Y), 
m+ = d-ij(Y_s)-Vj(Y), 
(36) 
where Ys for s E [-1, 1] is the rotational perturbation paths of y defined by (5.4.6). 
When VI (y) > 0, Z = 0 is a critical point of the functional a on Z corresponding to 
the system (1), but it need not be isolated. Then y(l) E Sp(2n)o. By Theorem 4.4.1, 
mO = dim ker a"(O) = Vl(y(l)) = vI(Y)· 
(37) 
Let E > 0 and Ys E PI (2n) with -1 :s s :s 1 be perturbation paths defined by 
(5.4.6) for y. Note that in this case Theorem 5.4.1 holds. For -1 :s s :s 1 define 
Bs(t) = -JYs (t)y~-I(t), 
"It E [0, 1], 
(38) 
1 
~ 
Hs(t, x) = "2Bs(t)x . x 
Vet, x) E R x R 
. 
(39) 
Then Bo(t) = B(t). When s i= 0, Bs E C(S], Ls(R2n)), Bs(t) = H;'(t, x), and 
Ys E Pj(2n). Denote the functionals defined in Section 4.2 according to Bs by f~ 
and as. Here we can also choose the dimension of the truncated space Z to be large 
enough so that the saddle point reduction method works for all s E [-1, 1]. Denote 
2d = dimZ. 
Then as converges to a in C2 as s -+ O. By Lemma 6, the origin z = 0 is an 
isolated critical point of as when s i= O. Denote the Morse indices of as at z = 0 by 
m -; , m ~, and m;- respectively. Then by Lemmas 6 and 7 we obtain 
(40) 
if s E [-1, 1] \ {OJ. When lsi > 0 is sufficiently small, the matrix a1 (0) is a small 
perturbation of a"(O). Thus in this case, m + :s m;- and m - :s m =s' Together with 
Lemmas 6 and 7 we obtain that, when 0 < s :s 1 and sufficiently close to 0, 
m- :s m=s = d + il (Y- s)· 
By Theorem 5.4.1, the above (41) can be rewritten into 
m+ :s d - il (Ys) = d - il (Y- s) -
VI (y). 
Note that dim Z = 2d. Together with (37) we then obtain 
(41) 
(42) 
(43) 
d - i] (Y-s) :s 2d - m- = m+ + mO = m+ + VI (y) :s d - il (Y- s).

Properties of index functions 
Thus in (44), equalities must hold and they yield the first and last equalities in (36) 
by Definition 5.4.2. 
The proof is complete. 
Theorem 8 For (J) E U and r > 0, let y E P~,w(2n). Then for any paths ct and 
f3 E P; w(2n) which are sufficiently CO-close to y, and any s E (0, 1], 
(45) 
(46) 
Proof: Without loss of generality we suppose r = 1. We still only study the case 
of (J) = 1 and leave other cases to the readers. 
Note that (46) follows from (45) and Theorem 5.4.1. We prove (45) in two steps. 
Step 1 y E P?(2n). We claim that there exists E = E(Y) such that (45) holds for 
all ct E P;(2n) n B;(y), where B;(y) is the open ball centered at y with radius E in 
PI (2n). 
Fix S E (0, 1]. We prove the left inequality in (45) indirectly by assuming that 
there exist ctk E P; (2n) for kEN such that ctk converges to y in C I as k ~ 00, and 
(47) 
Denote Bk(t) = -Jak(t)ct-;;I(t). ThenBk ~ BinCo. Therefore we can choose the 
truncated space Z to be large enough for all the B and Bk to carry out the saddle point 
reduction. Let 2d = dim Z. Denote by m-;;, mZ, and mt the Morse indices of the 
functional ak on Z corresponding to ctk, and by m-, mO, and m+ the Morse indices 
of the functional a on Z corresponding to y. Then whenever k is large enough, by 
Lemmas 6 and 7 we obtain 
Together with Theorem 1, we get the contradiction 
This proves the left inequality in (45). The right inequality in (45) follows by a similar 
proof. 
Step 2 Fix y E P?(2n). We choose a path f3 E CI([O, 1], Sp(2n» n P,(2n) such 
that f3(1) = y(l) and f3 ~I y. Using the function pet) = 3t2 - 2t3 for ° 
S t :'S 1, 
define 
yet) = f3(p(t», 
Vt E [0, 1]. 
(48) 
Then we obtain Y E PI (2n) and Y ~l Y with fixed end points. Specifically this 
implies Lli (y) = Lli (y). Thus by the construction in the proof of Theorem 5.4.1, 

6.11ndexfunctions and Morse indices 
143 
we obtain Ys (1) = Ys (1) and Ys "-' Ys for all s E [-1, 1] provided Y is sufficiently 
CO close to y. By Theorem 5.3.3, we obtain 
il(Ys) = il(Ys), 
VI(Ys) = VI (Ys) = 0, 
"Is E [-1, 1]\{0}. 
For the constant E = E(Y) > ° 
given by Step 1, let B~/2(Y) be the open ball centered 
at Y with radius E/2 in PI (2n) under the C([O, 1], Sp(2n» topology. By further 
requiring this E > ° 
to be much smaller, we can assume 
1~I(Y) -
~1(a)1 ::; 1/2, 
Va E B~(y), 
1~I(Y) -
~l(a)1 ::; 1/2, 
Va E B~/2(Y)' 
Fix a path a E Pt(2n) n B~/2(Y)' Choose a E i\*(2n) n Bi(y) such that a(l) = 
a(l). Then we obtain 
I~l(a) -
~1(a)1 ::; 1. 
This implies ~l (a) = ~ 1 (a). By Lemma 5.2.4, this implies a "-' a. Then by 
Theorem 5.3.3, we obtain ilea) = ilea). Thus by (45), proved in Step 1 for y, we 
obtain (45), for Y, Y-s, Ys, and a. 
The proof is complete. 
D 
As a direct consequence of Theorem 8, we obtain 
Corollary 9 For any W E U, T > 0, and Y E P~,w (2n), denote by Ys for s E [-1, 1] 
the rotation perturbation paths defined by (5.4.6) for y. Thenfor any s E (0, 1], 
iw(Y-s) = 
sup inf{iwCB) I f3 E un P; w(2n)}, 
UEN(y) 
, 
(49) 
iw(Ys) = 
inf 
sup{iw(f3) I f3 E un P; w(2n)}, 
UEN(y) 
, 
(50) 
where N(y) is the set of all open neighborhoods ofy in P r (2n). 
Proof: Suppose y E P~ w(2n). For any U E N(y), by the definition (5.4.6) of Ys, 
there exists an s > ° 
sufficiently small such that both y-s and Ys are in U. So the 
right-hand side of (49) (or (50» is not greater (orless) than iw(y-s) (or iw(Ys». When 
U E N (y) is sufficiently small, by Theorem 8 there exists an s > ° 
sufficiently small 
such that the infimum (or supremum) on U n P; w(2n) is realized by iw(y-s) (or 
iw(Ys». Therefore the right-hand side of (49) (or'(50» is not less (or greater) than 
iw(y-s) (or iw(Ys». This proves the corollary. 
D 
Now we can also give an alternative definition of the index function for the degen-
erate paths: 
Definition 10 For any T > 0, W E U, and y E P~ w(2n), we define the index function 
iw(y) by 
, 
iw(y) = 
sup inf{iw(f3) I f3 E un P; w(2n)}, 
UEN(y) 
, 
(51) 
where N(y) is the set of all open neighborhoods of yin Pr (2n).

Note that by Theorem 8, Corollary 9 and Definition 10 are equivalent to the fol-
lowing more intuitive but less elegant results. 
Corollary 12 Foranyw E U, r > 0, and y E P~,w(2n), denote by ys/ors E [-1,1] 
the rotation perturbation paths defined by (S.4.6) for y. Then for any s E (0, 1], 
iw(y-s) = inf{iw(,B) I {3 E P; w(2n),

(S2) 
sup{i,({3) I {3 E P;(2n) 
{3 is sufficiently CO-close to y in P,(2n)}, 
(S3) 
where by saying that {3 is sufficiently CO-close to y in P,(2n) we mean that {3 is 
close enough to y in the topology of P,(2n) so that there exists a homotopy 8 : 
[0,1] --+ P,(2n) with the properties 8(0) = {3, 8(1) = y, and 8(s) E P;,w(2n)jor 
all 0 S s < 1. 
Definition 13 For any r > 0, w E U, and y E P~,w(2n), we define: 
iw(y) = inf{iw({3) I {3 E P; w(2n), 
{3 is sufficiently CO-close to yin P,(2n) 
in the sense described in Corollary I2}.

Remark 14 The relation theorem on the Morse index and the index function is estab-
lished in this section. Here Theorem 1 for i I and VI with VI (y) = 0, i.e., the w = I 
non-degenerate case Lemmas 6 and 7, was proved by C. Conley and E. Zehnder in 
[CoZ2] of 1984 for the case n 2: 2, and by E. Zehnder and the author in [LZel] of 
1990 for the case n = 1. Theorem I for il and VI with VI (y) > 0, i.e. the w = 1 
degenerate case was proved in [LonS] of 1990 and [Lon I 3] of 1997. The description 
and the proof of Theorem 1 for general w E U appeared in [LonI6]. The original 
proofs of Theorem I in [CoZ2], [LZeI], and [LonS] use the Conley homotopy index 
theory. Here in this book we have replaced the Conley homotopy index argument by 
a rather simple variational proof based on Lemma 3 following [Lon13]. Theorem 8 
was proved in [LonS] and [Lon13] for w = I and in [LonI6] for general w E U. That 
(4S) of Theorem 8 implies Definition 10 was pointed out to the author by a referee 
of [LZu3] from Annals of Mathematics in November 2000. Here we have used it to 
replace Definition 13 originally used in [LonI6].

6.2 An axiom approach and further properties 
In this section we study further properties of and give an axiom description to the 
index function theory defined on P e(2n) by Definition 5.4.3. 
PropositionlLetw E U. For any two paths YO andYI E P,(2n) with Yo(r) = YI(r), 
it holds that ~,(Yo) = ~,(YI) if and only ifio)(Yo) = i",(yj). 
Proof: Without loss of generality, suppose r = 1. If ])",(yo) = 0, this result follows 
from Lemma 5.2.4 and Theorem 5.3.3. 
Suppose ])",(yo) > O. Define ~(t) = Q(-t, ... , -t) for t E [0,1] by (5.4.2) with 
Y replaced by Yo. Then ~(1) = (Yj)-I(1) where (Yj)_1 is defined by (5.4.6) for 
j = 0, 1. Let 1jJ : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2n): be a path connecting ~(1) to M; or M;;. Then 
the path (Yj )-1 is homotopic to the joint path ~ * Yj. Thus these two paths possess 
the same rotation numbers. Then for j = 0 and 1 by Definition 5.4.2, we obtain 
~I (1jJ * ~ * Yj)/Jr 
(1) 
~l(1jJ)/Jr + ~I(n/Jr + ~I(YJ)/Jr 
where ~ depends on the normal form <>-product of Yo(1) = Yl (1). From (1) the 
proposition follows.

Corollary 2 Let wE U. For any two paths Yo and YI E P,(2n) with Yo(r) = YI (r), 
it holds that i",(yo) = i",(yj) if and only if YO ~'" YI on [0, r] with fixed end points. 
Proof: This is a consequence of Lemma 5.2.4 and Proposition 1. 
o 
Theorem 3 (Homotopy invariant). Let w E U. For any two paths Yo and Y1 E 
P,(2n), if Yo ~'" YI on [0, r], 
(2) 
Proof: Without loss of generality, we suppose r = 1. By Corollary 2, we only need 
to consider the case when the end points are not fixed. If ])",(yo) = 0, the claim 
follows from Lemma 5.2.4 and Definition 5.2.7. 
Suppose ])",(yo) > O. By Definition 5.0.3 and Yo 
~'" YI on [0, 1], we obtain 
])",(yo) = ])",(Yl). 
To prove the first equality in (2), by Step 2 in the proof of Theorem 1.8, there 
are smooth paths!;j E PI (2n) sufficiently close to Yj for j = 0 and 1 respectively 
such that !;j(1) = Yj(1) and ~I (!;j) = ~1 (Yj). Then i",(!;j) = i",(Yj) holds by 
Proposition 1, and!;i ~'" Yi with fixed end points by Corollary 2 for i = 0 and 1. 
Combining the homotopies from!;o to yo, from YO to Yl, and from Yl to!;I, we obtain 
a homotopy 8 E C([O, 1]2, Sp(2n» from!;o to!;1 in PI(2n) such that ])",(8s (1» = 
constant for all 0 :s s :s 1. By Lemma 1.5, we can further assume 
8s == 8(s, -) E PI (2n), 
V s E [0, 1].

Properties of index functions 
Consider the linear Hamiltonian system (1.1) with B = Bs(t) whose fundamental 
solution is 8s• By Theorem 1.1 we obtain 
{ mt = dw - iw(8s ) - vw(8s ), 
m~ = vw(8s ) = vw(Yo), 
m; = dw + iw(8s ), 
(4) 
for all s E [0, lJ. Then by Lemma 1.3, these Morse indices are constants for all 
s E [0, 1]. Thusweobtainil(~O) =il(~d. This proves the first equality of (2). 
0 
Theorem 4 (Inverse homotopy invariant). Let W E U. For any two paths Yo 
and Yl E Pr(2n) with iw(YO) = iw(Yl), suppose that there exists a continuous path 
h : [0,1] --+ Sp(2n) such that h(O) = Yo(r), h(1) = Yl (r), and vw(h(s» = vw(Yo) 
for all s E [0, 1]. Then Yo ~ w Yl on [0, r] along h. 
Proof: Note that Yo and the joint path h * YO : [0, r] --+ Sp(2n) are homotopic 
on [0, r] along h. We denote this homotopy by a : [0,1] x [0, r] --+ Sp(2n). By 
Theorem 3, iw(hl[o,sl*YO) = iw(Yo)for all s E [0, 1], andtheniw(h*yo) = iw(Yl). So 
from h * YO ( r) = Yl ( r) and Corollary 2 we obtain that h * Yo and Yl are homotopic on 
[O,r]withfixedendpoints. Denote this homotopy by,B : [0, 1] x [O,r] --+ Sp(2n). 
We define a new map 8 : [0, 1] x [0, r] --+ Sp(2n) (cf. Figure 2) by 
{
a(2/~t' t), 
8(s,t) = 
,B(2 rs-t -
1 t) 
T-t 
" 
Then this 8 gives the w-homotopy of Yo ~w Yl on [0, r] along h. 
(5) 
o 
A direct consequence of Theorem 3 is that the index function is invariant under 
conjugation in Sp(2n). 
Corollary 5 Given a path Y E P r(2n) and a matrix M E Sp(2n), define ,B(t) = 
M-'y(t)MforO:'S t:'S r. Then 
(6) 
Proof: Choose a E Pr(2n) so that a(r) = M. Let 8(s, t) = a-1(s)y(t)a(s) for 
all (s, t) E [0,1] x [0, r]. Then we obtain Y ~w ,B on [0, r] along 8(-, r) via the 
homotopy 8. Thus (6) follows from Theorem 3.

Theorem 6 (Symplectic additivity). Suppose YO E Pr(2no) and Yl E Pr(2nd. 
Then YOOYI E Pr(2no + 2nl) and 
(7) 
Proof: Set r = 1. By Theorem 5.3.2, the arguments in Step 2 of the proof for 
Theorem 1.8 and Theorem 3, we only need to prove (7) when Yj E P?(2nj) for

iw(YooYJ) = iw([YO]-10 [YI1-]) 
= iw([YO]-I) + iw([YI1_]) 
Other cases of Yo and Yl being degenerate or not can be proved similarly.

Theorem 7 For W E U and r > 0, the w-index part of the index function defined on 
paths in Sp(2n) starting from the identity, i.e., the map iw : UnENPr(2n) -+ Z, is 
uniquely characterized by the following five axioms: 
1 ° (Homotopy invariant) For Yo and Yl E P r (2n), if YO ~ w Yl on [0, r] in the 
sense of Definition 5.0.3, then 
2° (Symplectic additivity) For any Yj E P r (2n j) with j = 0 and 1, 
iw(YOOYl) = iw(Yo) + iw(Yl)' 
(8) 
(9) 
3° (Clockwise continuity) For any Y E P r (2) satisfying y(r) = NJ (w, b) with 
b = ±1 or 0 if w = ±1, and b = 0 if w E (U\R), there exists a eo > 0 such 
that 
iw([y(r)<Pr,-O] * y) = iw(Y), 
V 0 < e s eo, 
(10) 
where <Pr,-O is defined by (5.1.1).

Properties of index functions 
4° (Counterclockwise jumping) For any y E Pr(2n) satisfying y(r) = NI (w, b) 
with b = ±1 if w = ±l, and b = 0 if w E (U\R), there exists a eo > 0 such 
that 
iw([y(r)¢r,O] * y) = iw(y) + 1, 
V 0 < e :s eo. 
(11) 
5° (Normality) Forao(t) = DO + t/r), 
iw(ao) = O. 
(12) 
Proof: Without loss of generality, let r = 1. Clearly the index function iw : 
UnENPI (2n) ~ Z defined by Definition 5.4.3 satisfies these five conditions. 
Suppose we have another index function J.L : UnENPI (2n) ~ Z satisfying these 
five conditions with the given w. Then by Theorems 1.9.3 and 2.4.1, for any y E 
PI (2n), we can connect y(l) by a path h : [0, 1] ~ Q~(y(l)) to 
M = MIO·, .oMpoMo, 
where p is a non-negative integer with 0 :s p :s n, each M j = N I (w j , b j) with 
Wj = W or (ij and bj = ±1 or 0 for 1 :s j :s p, Mo = M;;_p or M;;_p when p < n. 
Then by 1 0, 2°, and our argument in Case 2 of the proof of Theorem 5.4.1, J.L(Y) is 
completely determined by its value on PI (2). By 3° and 4°, J.L'S value is completely 
determined by its value on Pi,w(2). By 1 0, the value of J.L is completely determined 
by its value on all the standard paths ak in Sp(2) defined by (5.3.16) and (5.3.17). 
Then by 1 °,3°,4°, and 5°, we obtain J.L = iw on ak for all k E Z. This completes the 
proof.

Remark 8 It is easy to construct examples to show that the five axioms in Theorem 7 
are independent from each other. 
As a direct consequence of our study, for any end point free curve in the symplectic 
group, we can also define its index as follows. 
Definition 9 Letw E U. For any curve f E C([a, b], Sp(2n)), choose ~ E PI (2n) so 
that ~(1) = f(a). Define ry(t) = ~(2t) for t E [0, 1/2], and ry(t) = f(a + (2t - 1) 
(b - a)) for t E [1/2, 1]. Define 
(13) 
By our above study of the index i I it is easy to see that the definition (13) only 
depends on f itself, and therefore is well defined. As a direct consequence of 
Theorem 7, we give a characterization of the index i below, whose proof is left 
to the readers, 
Corollary 10 The index i defined above for continuous curves in the symplectic 
groups is uniquely determined by the following five axioms: 
1 ° (Homotopy invariant) Two continuous curves in Sp(2n) with the same initial 
and end points possess the same index if and only if they can be continuously 
deformed to each other with the end points fixed. 
2° (Vanishing) i(f) = 0 iff E C([a, b], Sp(2n)) with vI(f(t)) = constant.

3° (Symplectic additivity) iUoo/d = iUo) + iUd if Ii E C([a, b], Sp(2ni)) 
with i = ° 
and 1. 
4° (Catenation) i(f) = iUlra,b]) + iUI[b,c]) if I E C([a, c], Sp(2n)) with 
a < b < c. 
5° (Normality) For J(t) = NI (1, b)R(t /2) with t E [-1, 1], b = ±I or 0, 
iUI[-I,Oj) = ° and 
iUI[o,l]) = 2 - Ibl· 
Next we classify the exponential paths in Sp(2) defined before Lemma 1.7. We 
omit the subindex 1 when there is no confusion. 
Lemma 11 (T. An and Y. Long [AnL2]). Let Y E P r (2) be an exponential path. 
Then 
I 
(2Z + 1) U {a}, 
il(Y) E 
{a, -I}, 
2Z+ 1, 
if VI (y) = 0, 
if VI (y) = 1, 
if VI(Y) = 2. 
(14) 
Proof: For r > 0, let Y (t) = exp(t J B) for ° :s t :s r be an exponential path with 
B = (~ ~). for some a, b, and c E R. Then I E a(y(r)) if and only if 
a(J B) n F-l2nZ ::I 0, 
By direct computation we obtain that the eigenvalues of J B are given by 
Thus 
Y E P;(2) if and only if b2 - ac ::I -4k2n, 
Vk E Z. 
Using notation from Chapters 4 to 6, we obtain

where fL = 2mn for m E Z. Then it possesses double eigenvalues 
When m = ° 
we have 
(A -
B)IEo = -BIR2n. 

150 
6 Properties of index functions 
Thus it possesses two simple eigenvalues 
At = ~ [-(a + c) ± J (a - c)2 + 4(b2 - ac)] . 
To calculate the Morse index of the functional a in the saddle point reduction as 
studied in Section 2, it suffices to know the total multiplicity of negative eigenvalues 
of (A - B)lz. Recall that 2d = dim Z and 
where n E N is large enough so that A~ > ° 
and A;;; < ° 
for m > n. 
Suppose b2 - ac f. -4k2;r for all k E Z. If b2 - ac > 0, we obtain A~ > ° 
and A;;; < ° 
for all m E Z. So m+ = m- = d and mO = 0. This implies 
il (y) = VI (y) = 0. If b2 - ac < 0, we obtain A; f. ° 
for all m E Z\ {OJ. Since 
° :s b2 < ac, we must have At > ° 
or At < 0. When At > 0, it holds that 
m- = d + 2h - 1, m+ = d - 2h + 1, and mO = ° 
for some h E Z. When At < 0, it 
holds that m- = d + 2h + 1, m+ = d - 2h - 1, and mO = ° 
for some h E Z. Thus 
we always have il (y) E 2Z + I and VI (y) = 0. 
When b2 - ac = -4k2;r for some k E Z\{O}, similarly we obtain il (y) E 2Z + 1 
and VI (y) = 2. 
When b2 - ac = 0, we have A~ > ° 
and A;;; < ° 
for all m E Z\{O}. If a + c = 0, 
we obtain il(Y) = -1 and VI(Y) = 2. If a + c > ° 
we obtain il(Y) = ° 
and 
VI (y) = 1. If a + c < 0, we obtain i I (y) = -1 and VI (y) = 1. 
Thus the proof is complete. 
0 
Based on this result we have the following classification of exponential paths. 
Theorem 12 (T. An and Y. Long [AnL2l). An exponential path yet) = exp(t J B) 
for t ~ ° 
with B E .cs (R2) must be of one of the following three types: 
1 ° fixed point type, i.e. y(t) = hfor all t ~ 0. 
2° radiation type, i.e. h f. yet) E Sp(2)o for all t > ° 
or yet) E Sp(2)+ for 
all t > 0. 
3° rotation type, i.e. yet) rotates in the Sl directionofSp(2) within Sp(2)-U{h} 
as t increases and intersects Sp(2)o only at h on discrete times. 
Proof: We use notation from the proof of Theorem 1. 
If b2 - ac = 0, we have (tb)2 - t2ac = ° 
for all t ~ 0. By our discussion in 
the proof of Lemma 11, y is either of the fixed point type or yet) E Sp(2)o is of the 
radiation type. 
If b2 - ac > 0, yet) E Sp(2)+ for t > ° 
is of radiation type. 
If b2 - ac < 0, y lies in Sp(2)- U {h} and there exists an increasing positive 
number sequence ltd such that tf(b2 - ac) = -4k2;r. Then y is of the rotation 
ty~ .

Chapter 7 
Relations with other Morse indices 
In this chapter, we study the relations between the index function theory on 
P r (2n) and other Morse index theories for Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems. In 
Section 7.1, we study the Galerkin approximation method for Hamiltonian systems. 
In Section 7.2, we give a simple prooffor the coincidence of the Morse index of second 
order Hamiltonian systems with the I-index defined in Chapter 5 of the corresponding 
linearized first order Hamiltonian systems. In Section 3, based on 1. Duistermaat's 
work [Duil], we study the general Lagrangian systems. 
7.1 
The Galerkin approximation 
In this section we study the relation between the I-index of periodic solutions of 
Hamiltonian systems and the Morse index of the corresponding functional defined 
via the Galerkin approximation method on the finite dimensional truncated space at 
its corresponding critical points. 
Given a Hamiltonian function H satisfying the conditions (HI) and (H2) with 
r > 0 in Section 4.1, we consider the nonlinear Hamiltonian system, 
i = JHI/(t,x), 
(1) 
As in Section 4.1, we denote W = W I/2,2(Sr, R2n) with Sr = R/(rZ) and the norm 
(4.1.4). 
Fix a matrix function Boo E C(Sr, .cs(R2n )). For Wm given by (4.1.14), let Pm : 
W -+ Wm be the projection. Then {Pm: W -+ Wm} form a Galerkin approximation 
scheme with respect to A - Boo. Note that 
(2) 
Let f be the functional defined by (4.1.3) for the above Hamiltonian function H, and 
f m = f 0 Pm : W m -+ R be its restriction on W m. Our aim in this section is to study 
the Morse index of fm at its critical point Xm E Wm in terms of the I-index of Boo 
and B = HI/(·, x(·)) defined via the linear system 
y = J B(t)y, 
(3) 
For any bounded linear self-adjoint operator L defined on a subspace domL of W, 
we denote by E*(L) with * = -,0, and +, the eigenvector subspace of L belonging 
to the eigenvalues in (-00,0), {OJ, and (0, +00) respectively. For any 8 > 0 we 
denote by Et(L) with * = -, 0, and +, the eigenvector subspace of L belonging 
to the eigenvalues in (-00, -8], (-8,8), and [8, +00) respectively. We also denote 

7.1 The Galerkin approximation 
L# = (LIImd- I and for 8 > 0 let 
{ m*(L) = dim E*(L), 
m'8(L) = dim E"8(L), 
for * = -,0, +, 
for * = -,0, +. 
The following is the main result in this section. 
153 
(4) 
Theorem 1 (G. Fei and Q. Qin [FeQ2]). Let {Pm: W -+ Wm} be the Galerkin 
approximation scheme defined above with respect to A - Boo for A = - J d / dt and 
Boo E C(S" .cs(R2n». Then there exists a sufficiently great mo > 0 depending on 
Boo and B such that for all m 2: mo, 
mt(Pm(A - B)Pm) = m + iI(Boo) - iI(B) + VI (Boo) -
VI(E), 
(5) 
m~(Pm(A - B)Pm) = VI (B), 
(6) 
m[;(Pm(A - B)Pm) = m - il(Boo) + il(B), 
(7) 
where 8 = ~II(A - B)#1I-1. 
Remark 2 In general one can not hope that the left-hand sides of (5)-(7) may be 
replaced by dim E*(Pm(A-B)Pm), because there exist Boo andB E C(Sr, .cs(R2n» 
such thatthe equality in (4.1.15) does not hold. Since Pm (A - B)Pm is an approxima-
tion of A - B, the m'8 index introduced by G. Fei and Q. Qiu in [FeQ2] is reasonable 
and reflects the possibility of perturbations of zero eigenvalues of A - B to nearby 
positive or negative ones. 
In order to prove this theorem, we need the following result from T. Kato's cele-
brated book [Kat!] whose proof is omitted here. Recall that.cb (W) and.cc (W) denote 
the sets of bounded and compact linear operators on W respectively. For any T and 
Tk E .cb(W) for kEN, T is the strong limit of Tn and denoted by s-limk--.+oo h 
if Tk W -+ Twin W as k -+ +00 for any w E W. 
Proposition 3 (Problem VI.2.36 and Lemma VI.S.6 of [Katl]). Let pi; : W -+

Suppose M + B is invertible. Then

Definition 5 (G. Fei [Feil], G. Fei and Q. Qiu [FeQ2]). For any M E .cb(W) and

Theorem 6 (G. Fei and Q. Qiu [FeQ2]). Let M E .cb(W), Bj and Sj E .cc(W)

Proof: Let Pj and Qj denote the orthogonal projections from W to E*(M - Bj) 
and E*(M - Bj - Sj) respectively for j = 1,2 and * = +, -, O. Let 
T = (P2+ + P~)pt : ptw -+ piW EB P~W, 
Ts = (P2+ + p~)Qi : QiW -+ P2+W EB P~W.

Proof: Denote by Yj the fundamental solution of the linear Hamiltonian system with 
coefficient Bj(t) for j = 1,2. We continue the proof in two cases. 
Case 1 V1 (B1) = VI (B2) = O. 
In this case, by our discussion in Section 5.3, there are two standard matrix functions 
Bk j with j = 1, 2 defined by (5.3.8)-( 5.3.15) such thatthe corresponding fundamental

solutions satisfy ~kj ~I Yj. Denote the corresponding homotopy matrix functions 
by Bj,s for j = 1,2 and s E [0, 1]. Then 
vI(Bj,s) = 0, 
"Is E [0, 1], j = 1,2. 
This is 
for s E [0, 1], j = 1,2. 
Thus by Theorem 6, the index I (A - BI,s, A - B2,s) is locally constant for s E [0, 1], 
and thus is constant on [0, 1]. Then we obtain 
By direct verification, as in our discussion in Section 6.1, which is left to the readers, 
we obtain 
Then (14) follows in this case. 
Case 2 VI (Bd f= 0 or VI (B2) f= O. 
In this case, let Yj be the associated symplectic paths of Bj and Yj,s be the pertur-
bation paths of Yj defined by (5.4.6), and Bj,s be coefficients of the corresponding 
Hamiltonian systems for j = 1, 2 and s E [-1, 1] respectively. Then 
vI(Bj,s) =0, 
"Is E [-I,I]\{O},j= 1,2, 
and 
Therefore by Theorem 6 and the above Case 1, for s > 0 sufficiently close to 0 we 
obtain

Thus (14) holds.

7.1 The Galerkin approximation 
157 
We need the following well-known algebraic lemma whose proof is left to the 
readers. 
Lemma 8 Suppose Z is a finite dimensional Hilbert space, X and Yare subspaces 
ofZ. Then 
dim(X n yl..) - dim(Xl.. n Y) = dim X - dim Y. 
(15) 
In order to approximate degenerate operators by non-degenerate ones, we need 
corresponding result on eigenprojections of bounded operators in a Banach space X. 
By Remark IY.2.16 of [Katl], the topology on Lb(X) induced by the gap function 
8(., .) is identical to the norm topology. Therefore Theorem Iy'3.16 of [Katl] implies 
the following theorem: 
Theorem 9 (cf. Theorem IV.3.16 of [Katl]). Let X be a Banach space and 
T E Lb(X) be a closed operator. Suppose aCT) contains a bounded part ao(T) 
separated from the rest al (T) in such a way that ao(T) consists of finitely many 
eigenvalues with finite multiplicities, and a rectifiable simple closed curve r in C 
can be drawn so as to enclose an open set containing ao(T) in its interior. Let 
X = Mo(T) EB MI (T) be a decomposition of invariant subspaces of T such that 
a(TIMi(T) = ai(T)fori = o and 1. Denote by poeT) : X ---+ Mo(T) the projection 
along M1 (T). Then there exists a 8 > 0 such that any S E Lb(X) that satisfies 
liS - Til < 8 has a spectrum separated by r into two parts ao(S) and ~1 (S), in the 
corresponding decomposition X = Mo(S) EB M1 (S), Mi (S) is isomorphic to Mi (T), 
in particular dim Mi (S) = dim Mi (T), and the projection Po(S) : X ---+ Mo(S) 
along Ml (S) tends to poeT) in norm as II S - Til ---+ O. 
Now we can give 
Proof of Theorem 1: Without loss of generality, set T = 1. We divide the proof into 
three parts. 
Case 1 VI (Boo) = VI (B) = O. 
Similar to Lemma 6.1.2, we obtain dimker(A - B) = VI (B) = 0 and A - B is 
invertible. Then by Corollary 4.1.6 we obtain (6), i.e. there exists m I > 0 such that 
(16) 
Since the operators B and Boo on E are compact, there exists m2 2: m1 such that 
for all m 2: m2, 
11(1- Pm)(Boo - B)II + II (Boo - B)(I- Pm)11 
:s min { 28, ~ II A - B II } . 
Recall that 8 = ~ II (A - B)# 11-1. From 
Pm (A - B)Pm = (A - B)Pm + (Pm - J)(Boo - B)Pm,

(18) 
This implies 
E;(Pm(A - B)Pm) = E*(Pm(A - B)Pm), 
for * = -,0, +, 
(19) 
for m :::: m2. Therefore (6) holds by (16). 
Let Qm = Boo + Pm(B - Boo)Pm and 
Then 
A-B=A-Qm+Fm· 
By the definition of Qm, there exists m3 :::: m2 such that for all m :::: m3, 
This yields 
Together with (17) this proves that A -
Qm + s Fm for all s E [0, 1] defines a non-
degenerate homotopy from A -
Qm to A -
B provided m :::: m3. 
By the same homotopy argument as that in the proof of Case 1 of Theorem 7, we 
obtain 
By the definitions of {Pm} and Qm, when m ~ 00 we obtain 
II Pm (A - Boo)Pm - (A -
Boo)lI.cb(W) 
~ 0, 
II Pm (A - Qm)Pm - (A -
Qm)lI.cb(W) 
~ o. 
(20) 
Thus by the same homotopy argument in the proof of Theorem 7, there exists m4 :::: m 3 
such that for any m :::: m4, 
By the definition (4.1.14) of Wm , Definition 5, and Lemma 8, we then obtain 
I(Pm(A -
Qm)Pm, Pm (A -
Boo)Pm) 
= m+(Pm(A - B)Pm) - m+(Pm(A -
Boo)Pm) 
(22) 
= m+(Pm(A - B)Pm) - m. 

7.1 The Galerkin approximation 
159 
Together with (19), (20), (21), and Theorem 7, we obtain (5). Then (7) follows from 
(5) and (6). 
Case 2 Vl (Boo) > 0 and VI (B) = O. 
Note that by the same proof in Case 1, we obtain (16) and (19). Therefore (6) 
holds. 
In order to prove (5) and (7), let y be the fundamental solution of the linear 
Hamiltonian system corresponding to Boo(t). For s E [-1,1], let Ys and B~(t) 
be the perturbation paths and matrix functions defined by the corresponding (5.4.6) 
and (6.1.38) respectively. By our study in Sections 5.4 and 6.1, specifically we have 
VI (B~) = 0 for s E [-1, I]\{O}. Recall that we have chosen {Pm: W -+ Wm} to be 
a Galerkin approximation scheme with respect to A - Boo. Let {P;" : W -+ W;"} for 
s E [-1, 1] be a Galerkin approximation scheme with respect to A -
B~ given by 
Theorem 9 so that II P;" -
Pm II w -+ 0 as Is I -+ O. Especially the space W;" = P;" W 
satisfies 
dim W;" = dim Wm . 
By Vl (B) = 0 and (18), we can choose m5 > 0 sufficiently great such that 
(i) the non-zero eigenvalues of A -
B become non-zero eigenvalues of Pm 
(A - B)Pm and they are away from 0 by at least E > 0 for any m ~ m5 
and some fixed E > O. 
Thus by our discussion at the beginning of Case 2, (6), and (18) again, there 
exists t E (0, 1] such that 
(ii) mO(P;"(A - B)P;") = 0, positive eigenvalues of Pm(A - B)Pm are perturbed 
to nearby positive eigenvalues of P;" (A - B)P;", and all positive eigenvalues 
of P;"(A -
B)P;" are obtained by perturbation from positive eigenvalues of 
Pm(A - B)Pm for any m 2: m5 and lsi:::: t. 
Now we choose m6 ~ m5 such that 
(iii) Theorem 1 holds for P~ (A -
B)P~ when we replace Pm in (5)-(7) by P~ for 
any m ~ m6. 
By (ii) and a proof similar to that of Lemma 6.1.3 we obtain 
(23) 
for any m ~ m6 and lsi:::: t. 
When s leaves from s = 0, the zero eigenvalue of A -
Boo becomes positive or 
negative eigenvalues of A -
B~ whose total multiplicities are denoted by I-L+ (s) and 
I-L- (s) respectively, and it holds that 
(24) 
Note that by Theorem 6.1.8, it holds that I-L+(s) = I-L-(-s) = 0 and I-L-(s) = 
I-L+(-s) = vI(Boo) for any 0 < s < 1. But we do not need this result in our 
following proof. 

160

Relations with other Morse indices 
By our above discussion, for any m 2: m6 and s = t, we obtain 
m+(Pm(A - B)Pm) = m+(p';S(A -
B)P';S) 
= m + IL+(-S) + il(B~S) - il(B) 
(25) 
.:s m + VI (Boo) + il(Boo) - i1(B), 
where we have used (23), Case 1 of Theorem 1, and Definition 5.4.2. Similarly we 
obtain 
m+(Pm(A - B)Pm) = m+(P:'(A - B)P:') 
= m + IL+(S) + il(B~) - iJ(B) 
(26) 
= m + IL+(S) + VI (Boo) + il(Boo) - il(B), 
where we have used (23), Case 1 of Theorem 1, Theorem 5.4.1, and Definition 5.4.2. 
Combining (25) and (26) together, we obtain IL+(S) = 0, IL+( -s) = VI (Boo), and 
by (19) we obtain (5). Then (7) follows from (5) and (6). 
Case 3 VI (B) > O. 
Note that in this case, (18) and then (19) may not hold anymore. 
Let y be the fundamental solution of the linear Hamiltonian system corresponding 
to B(t). For S E [-1, 1], let Ys and Bs(t) be the perturbation paths and matrix functions 
defined by corresponding (5.4.6) and (6.1.38) respectively. Fix So E (0, 1] such that 
II B -
Bs II < 8/2 for 0 < Is I .:s so. By Cases 1 and 2, there exists m7 > 0 such that 
for m 2: m7, 0 < lsi .:s so, 
m+(Pm(A -
Bs)Pm) = m + il (Boo) - il (ys) + VI (Boo), 
(27) 
Let ms 2: m7 be such that for m 2: ms it holds that dim Pm ker(A - B) = VI (B). 
Define a subspace Ym of Wm by Wm = Pm ker(A - B) E9 Ym. If there exists some 
Y E E~(Pm(A - B)Pm) n Ym with lIyll = 1, then 
(30) 
But on the other hand, for y E Y m we have 
y = (A -
B)#(A - B)y 
= (A -
B)#(Pm(A -
B)Pmy + (Pm -I)(B -
Boo)Y)· 
By (17) for m 2: m I this implies 

7.1 The Galerkin approximation 
161 
This contradicts (30) and proves 
E?(Pm(A - B)Pm) n Ym = 0. 
(31) 
Thus by the definition of Y m we obtain 
m~(Pm(A - B)Pm):::: v1(B). 
(32) 
When s > 0 is sufficiently small, Pm (A -
Bs ) Pm and is a small perturbation of 
Pm (A - B) Pm on the same space W. Note that positive eigenvalues of Pm (A - B) Pm 
in [8, +(0) are perturbed to nearby positive eigenvalues of Pm(A -
Bs)Pm when 
Is I > 0 is sufficiently small. Thus we can choose m9 2: ms such that for all m 2: m9 
and s > 0 small we obtain 
mt(Pm(A - B)Pm) :::: m+(Pm(A -
Bs)Pm) 
= m + i1 (Boo) + V1 (Boo) - iI (Bs) 
(33) 
:::: m + i1 (Boo) + V1 (Boo) -
il (B) -
VI (B), 
where we have used Cases 1 and 2, Theorem 5.4.1, and Definition 5.4.2. 
Similarly for m 2: m9 and s > 0 sufficiently small, we obtain 
mt(Pm(A - B)Pm) 
2: m+(Pm(A - B-s)Pm) -
m~(Pm(A - B)Pm) 
= m + il(Boo) + v1(Boo) - il(B-s) -
m~(Pm(A - B)Pm) 
= m + i1 (Boo) + VI (Boo) -
i1 (B) -
m~(Pm(A - B)Pm, 
where we have used Cases 1 and 2, and Definition 5.4.2. 
(34) 
Combining (33), (34), and (32) we obtain (6) and (5). Then (7) follows from (5) 
and (6). 
The proof is complete. 
Corollary 10 (G. Fei [Feil], G. Fei and Q. Qiu [FeQ2]). Let {Pm} be a Galerkin 
approximation scheme with respect to A. Using notation oj Theorem 1, Jar any B E

Our aim in this paper is to give a variational proof of the coincidence of the Morse 
indices of system (1) and the index of the corresponding system (5). 
Theorem 1 (T. An and Y. Long [AnLl]). Under the above conditions,

The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1. 
Fix M 
E C(Sr, Ls(Rn)). We apply the saddle point reduction method in 
Section 4.3 to the system (5) with coefficient B(t) of (4), and use notations there. 
Especially we obtain by Theorem 4.3.l the functional as E C2(Zs, R) and the injec-
tion map Us E C2(Zs, W). 
Let 2ds = dim Zs. Denote the positive, null, and negative Morse indices of as at 
Zs = 0 by mi, m-;, and m~ respectively. By Theorem 6.1.1,

Lemma 2 WI and W2 are <I>-orthogonal and X = WI EB W2. 
Proof: For any X = (p, 0) E WI and Y = (q, q) E W2, by direct computation and 
(9) we obtain <I>(x, y) = O. On the other hand, for any X = (p, q) E X, we have

Lemma 3 The injection Us : Zs --+ W is linear, maps Z; and Z; into WI and W2 
respectively, and us(Zs) S; X. 
Proof: From the linearities of gb, Ps±' Ao, and the equation (4.5.13), we obtain the 
linearities of x;-. Then this yields the linearity of us. 
We rewrite the equation (4.5.13) into the form 
(11) 
Denote by Pi± the projection Ps±lvnwi : V n Wi --+ Z! for i = 1 and 2. For z = 
(ZI, Z2) E (W x X2) n Zs, denote (p+, q+) = S;x;(z) and (p-, q-) = S;x;(z). 
Using (4.3.1), (4.3.9), (4.2.4), (4.3.13), and the projection Po defined at the beginning 
of Section 4.3, equation (11) yields 
q+ + Pop+ = pt(I + Po)(P+ + p- + zt}, 
-jJ+ + POq+ = P2+(M + Po)(q+ + q- + Z2), 
q- + PoP- = PI-(I + Po)(p+ + p- + zt}, 
-jJ- + POq- = P2-(M + Po)(q+ + q- + Z2), 
where M is the linear operator induced by M(t). From (12) and (14), we obtain

When z E Z;, we have ZI = Z2. Thus u;(z) = u;(z). Then us(z) E W2 whenever 
z E Z;. 
From (12)-(16) we obtain 
q+ = p+, 
-jJ+ = P2+ M(t)(q+ + q- + Z2), 
q- = p-, 
-jJ- = P2- M(t)(q+ + q- + Z2). 
When Z2 = 0, by the uniqueness of this system, p+ = p- = q+ = q- = 0. Thus 
for Z = (ZI, 0), we have S;-x;-(z) = 0, and then us(z) = Z E WI.

Lemma 7 Denote by mj the Morse index of flw2' Then mj = m-(M).

Now we can give the proof of our main result.

Relations with other Morse indices 
Proof of Theorem 1: Fix M E C(Sr, L s(R2n». By the Floquet theory, VI (M) is 
equal to the dimension of the solution space of (S) and then that of (1). Thus we 
obtain mO(M) = VI (M). 
For the first equality in (7), by Lemmas Sand 7 it suffices to prove mj = m-; for 
s large enough. Since Us : Z; --+ W2 is a linear injection and as (z) = f (us (z» for 
z E Z;, we obtain m-; :::: mj for large s. On the other hand, suppose f is negative 
definite on a subspace W; of W2. Since W; is finite dimensional, there exists a 
constant 8 > ° 
such that 
f(x) :::: -8 < 0, 
Vx E W2-
with IIxll = 1. 
By Proposition 4.S.3, there exists So > ° 
such that for s ::: so, 
Thus as is negative definite on Ps(W;) by its 2-homogeneity. By Lemma 6, 
dim Ps(W2-) = dim W2- for large s. This proves m-; ::: mj and Theorem 1.

Remark 8 When M(t) == M is a constant symmetric matrix in (1), let al :::: 
a2 :::: ... :::: an be the eigenvalues of M. Then Proposition 9.1 of [MaWl] yields the 
following formulae for the Morse index and nullity of the system (1):

mO(M) = #{k I ak = o} + 2 L # 
i EN I :21 = ak .

Therefore m - (M) ranges over zero and all positive odd integers when n = 1 and 
M E Ls(Rn). Thus m-(M) ranges over all non-negative integers when n ::: 2 and 
ME Ls(Rn). 
For any T > 0, by Theorem IY.S.3 of [Eke3] the superquadratic second order

possesses a non-constant periodic solution Xl with minimal period T. For all kEN

Xk(t) = kxl (kt), 
Vt E R.

Then Xk is a non-constant periodic solution of (21) with minimal period T / k. By 
Theorem IO.S of [MaWl], for any kEN it holds thatm-(Mk) = 2k, where Mk(t) =

Remark 9 Theorem 1 was proved by T. An and the author in [AnLl] of 1998, which 
gives a rather simple proof for second order Hamiltonian systems as a special case of 
Theorem 3.l below for general Lagrangian systems. It is interesting to point out that 
the method of Theorem 1 can be generalized to prove Theorem 3.1 below for general 
Lagrangian systems as having been done recently by A. Abbondandolo in [AbbI]. 
7.3 
Lagrangian systems 
In this section, we consider the periodic problem of the calculus of variations, i.e., 
for r > 0 finding the critical points of the functional 
F(x) = fo' L(t, x, x)dt, 
Vx E W, 
(1) 
where W = W 1,2 (S" R n) with S, = R/ (r Z) is a Sobolev space with the usual 
inner product and norm 
(x, y) = for (x· y + X . y)dt, 
Ilxll = (x, x)1/2, 
for all x, YEW. In this section we suppose the Lagrangian function L = L(t, x, p) 
satisfies 
(Ll) L E C2(Sr x R 2n , R). 
(L2) (The Legendre convexity condition) 
Lp.p(x, p)z· z > 0, 
Under these conditions, F E C 2(W, R). A critical point x of F, i.e., an extreme 
loop of F, corresponds to a solution of the periodic boundary value problem of the 
Lagrangian system I
-9tLp(t, x, x) - L xU, x, x) = O. 
x(r) = x(O), 
x(r) = x(O). 
Fix such an extremal loop x and define 
l
P(t) = Lp,p(t, x(t), ~(t)), 
QU) = Lx,p(t, x(t), xU», 
R(t) = Lx,xU, xU), x(t»,

where Lx and Lx denote the corresponding gradients. Note that in this case, P and 
R E C(SI, £s(Rn» and Q E C(SI, £(Rn)). 
Suppose x E W is an extreme loop of the functional F. Then x is a r-periodic 
solution of problem (2). The Hessian of F at x is given by 
(F"(x)y, z}w = fal {(Py + Qy) . z + QT y. Z + Ry· z}dt, 
(4) 
for all y and z E W, where P, Q, and R are defined in (3). Therefore the linearized 
system of (2) at x is given by the Sturm system: 
(5) 
Denote the Morse index and nUllity of F at x by m-(x) and mO(x), i.e., the total 
multiplicities of all the negative eigenvalues and zeros of F" (x) respectively. 
Note that the linear periodic Sturm system (5) corresponds to the linear Hamiltonian 
system 
z = J B(t)z,

with

Q(t)T p-l(t)Q(t) - R(t) 
. 
(7) 
Denote the fundamental solution of this system (6)--(7) by Yx, and its index by 
(il (Yx), VI (Yx)). Then the following is the main result in this section. 
Theorem 1 (C. Viterbo [Vit2], Y. Long and T. An [LoAl]). Under the above 
conditions, 
(8) 
The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem. We need the 
following results from [Duil] of J. Duistermaat in 1976. 
Let (E, w) be a real symplectic vector space and A be the set of all Lagrangian 
subspaces of (E, w). For ex E A, let 
Ak(ex) = {,B E A I dim,8 n exk}. 
(9) 
If ex,,8 E A, ex n,8 = {OJ, then any d-dimensionallinear subspace y of E with 
y n,8 = {OJ can be written as 
y={u+AuluEex} 
(10) 
for a linear mapping A : ex --* ,8. Then the bilinear form 
Q(ex, ,8; y) : (u, v) 1-+ w(Au, v), 
Vu, v E ex, 
(11) 

7.3 Lagrangian systems 
169 
is symmetric if and only if YEA, so 
Q(ex, fJ) : Y f-+ Q(ex, fJ; y) 
(12) 
is a bijection from A o(fJ) to the space S2ex of symmetric bilinear forms on ex. 
Here note that in the actual computation the map A is obtained as a real matrix 
on E and is not unique in general. But the symmetric bilinear form Q(ex, fJ, Y)la 
is uniquely determined by ex, fJ, and y. We denote the negative and positive Morse 
indices of Q by ind- Q and ind+ Q. 
Note that by definition (9)-(10) for ex, fJ, and YEA satisfying ex n fJ = {O} and 
ex n Y = {O}, 
Q(ex, fJ; y) = -Q(ex, y ; fJ)· 
(13) 
Note that if fJ n y = {O} further holds, then 
Q(ex, fJ; y) = -Q(fJ, y ; ex). 
(14) 
Definition 2 (Definition 2.3 of [Duil]). The index of a continuous curve r E 
A o([a, b], A), not necessarily closed, is given by 
ind(r) = [r : '11] + ind- Q(r(b), fJ; rea)), 
(15) 
for any '11 E A o (r(a)) n A o(r(b)), where [r : '11] is the intersection number of r 
with '11. This definition is independent of the choice of '11 in A ° 
(r (a)) n A ° 
(r (b)). 
Let X be a C2-manifold of dimension nand L E C2(Z, R), where Z is an open 
subset of R x T X and T X is the tangent bundle of X. Define 
f(c) = foT L(t, c(t), c(t))dt, 
(16) 
for all c E C1([0, r], Z) with the usual uniform convergence topology of curves and 
their derivatives. 
Proposition 3 (Proposition 4.6 of [Duil]). If c is a critical point of f with respect 
to the periodic boundary condition 
(c(a), c(r)) E R = {(x, y) E X x X Ix = y} 
(17) 
and r is a covering such that Dyr(O, 0) = Dyr(r, 0), then the Morse index of fat 
c satisfies 
iR(c) = ind(cp) - n, 
(18) 
where cp denotes the curve t f-+ graph<I>(O, t), t running from 0 to r. 

170 
7 Relations with other Morse indices 
To keep our discussion short, we refer readers to [Duil] for details of the proofs of 
the above results. 
Proof of Theorem 1: Without loss of generality, set r = 1. The second identity in 
(8) follows directly from the classical Floquet theory. The proof of the first identity in 
(8) is carried out below in six steps. In the following we denote by V4n == (R4n , J $ 
(-J)), A the set of Lagrangian subspaces in V4n, and by A ocr) the set of all IV E A 
such that IV n r = {OJ. 
Step 1 By the above Proposition 3 and Definition 2, 
m-(x) = ind(rx) - n 
(19) 
where r x is the graph of Yx in the symplectic space V4n, which forms a path in A, 
and IV E A ocr x (1)) nil. Ocr x (0)). By (19), to get the first identity in (8), it suffices 
to show that for the graph rx of Yx, 
il(Yx) +n = [rx: IV] +ind-Q(rx(I), IV; rx(O)), 
for any IV E AO(rx(1)) n AO(rx(O)). 
(20) 
Step 2 If Yx is degenerate, for any sufficiently small E > 0, by our discussion in 
Chapters 5 and 6, we can construct a short path ~ : [0, 1] --7 Sp(2n) such that 
~(O) = yx(l), ~(t) E Sp(2n)* for all 0 < t :s 1, and il (~* Yx) = il (Yx). Denote the 
graph of ~ * Yx by Ex. On the other hand, since IV E A Ocr x(I)) nil. Ocr x(O)) is an 
open condition, for small enough E > 0 we still have IV E A o(Ex (1)) n A o(EAO)), 
[Ex: IV] = [rx : IV], and 
Thus it suffices to prove (20) for the path ~ * Yx E Pi (2n) and its graph Ex in A with 
a small enough E > O. 
Step 3 Since both Duistermaat's "ind(r)" and the index i I (y) are homotopy invariant, 
we only need to compute the both sides of (20) with Yx being replaced by a special 
path in each homotopy class Pi I (2n) defined in Section 5.2. Then it suffices to 
prove (20) for each standard zig~ag path ¢k == O:k E p} I (2n) for k E Z defined in 
Section 5.3 and its graph <l>k with k E Z. 
. 
Step 4 Since the path ¢k is a o-product of paths in P(2)*, both the Duistermaat 
"ind" and the index i I are symplectic ally additive, we only need to verify (20) for 
each o-component of ¢k and its graph respectively. Thus without loss of generality, 
we suppose ¢k = O:k E PI (2) is given by (5.3.16) or (5.3.17) with n = 1. We still 
denote the graph of ¢k E PI (2) by <l>k. From il (¢k) = k of (5.3.18), to get (20) it 
suffices to prove the equalities 
[<I>k : IV] + ind-Q(<I>k(1), IV; <l>k(O)) = k + 1, 
for each k E Z and some IV Ell. O(<I>k(l)) n A ° 
(<I>k (0)). 
(21) 

7.3 Lagrangian systems 
171 
Step 5 The proof of (21) for odd integers k. 
Fix k E 2Z - 1. Then <Pk is a path in A, and 
where 11 is the diagonal of V4. Choose 
Note that here we choose Ilf so that the three Lagrangian subspaces Ilf, r _, and r + 
of V4 are mutually transverse. By direct computation we obtain that 
<Pk(t) n r + 1= (0 
if and only if cos(tkrr) = 4/5, 
and the intersection number at such a time t is 1. When t runs from 0 to 1, there are 
precisely k such times. Therefore we obtain 
[<Pk : Ilf] = k. 
(25) 
On the other hand, 
where the first equality follows from the definitions of <Pk and Ilf, the second equality 
follows from (13). By a direct computation we obtain that the 4 x 4 matrix A : r - -+ 
11 determined by r + via (10) can be chosen to have the form 
(
0 
02 0) 
o 
0 0 -4 
A = 
-4 0 
0 
0 
. 
o 
2 0

By (11), the quadratic form Q(r _,11; r +) is defined to be the restriction of the 
quadratic form given by the 4 x 4 matrix [J EEl (-J)]A to the Lagrangian subspace 
r _ ofV4. By direct computation we obtain that for any x = (XI,X2, -2XI, -x2/2)T 
and Y = (YI, Y2, -2YI, -Y2/2)T E r_, 
(27) 
Thus we obtain 
(28) 
Now (25), (26), and (28) yield (21) and then (8). 

172 
7 Relations with other Morse indices 
Step 6 The proof of (8) for even integers k. 
Fix k E 2Z. Then (23) holds and <l>k(1) = r +. Choose \11 = r _. By direct 
computation we obtain that 
<l>k(t) n r _ =1= 0 if and only if cos(tkJr) = -4/5, 
and the intersection number at such a time t is 1. When t runs from 0 to 1, there are 
precisely k such times. Therefore (25) still holds. 
On the other hand, 
where the first equality follows from the definitions of <l>k and \11, the second equality 
follows from (14). Thus by (25), (28), and (29), we obtain (21) and then (8). 
The proof of Theorem 1 is complete.

Next we study the relationship between our index function theory and the index 
functions of R. Bott defined in [Botl]. The proof of the following Theorem 4 needs 
some knowledge of the splitting numbers defined in Section 9.1 below. Note that the 
Bott index function is defined by the Morse index and nullity (A(w), N(w)) of the 
Lagrangian system in (2) with the boundary value conditions 
x(r) = wx(O), 
x(r) = wx(O). 
(30) 
As before, we denote by Yx the fundamental solution of the linear Hamiltonian system 
(6) with B(t) defined by (7). 
Theorem 4 Under the above assumptions, 
(31) 
Proof: Note that the second equality holds by definition of the two sides. To prove 
the first equality, denote by B Sit (w) the splitting numbers defined on page 180 of 
[Botl]. Then by a direct verification we obtain that (BSjj(w), BS"M(w)) satisfies 
the four axioms in Theorem 9.1.10 below for all M E Un>lSp(2n). Therefore it 
coincides with our splitting numbers (sjj(w), S"M(w)) defin~d in Section 9.1 below. 
Thus we obtain 
(32) 
By Theorem 1 we obtain that the right-hand side of (32) is zero. Thus the first equality 
in (31) holds.

Remark 5 Theorem 1 was first proved by C. Viterbo in [Vit2] of 1990. The proof 
here was given by T. An and the author in [LoAl] of 1998. Theorem 4 was proved 
in [LonI6] of 1999. 

7.3 Lagrangian systems 
173 
It is well known that there are infinitely many ways to define the index theory 
for symplectic paths in the non-degenerate case and degenerate case. The exist-
ing definitions in many other papers are different from ours. But in the sense of 
Theorems 1.1,2.1, and 3.1 in this chapter, as well as Theorems 6.1.1 and 15.1.1, 
definitions of the index theory in Chapter 5 for both the non-degenerate case and the 
degenerate case are natural. 

Part IV 
Iteration Theory 
As mentioned in the Introduction of this book, iteration theories of various Morse and 
Maslov type index theories were studied by many mathematicians for closed geodesics 
on Riemannian manifolds, periodic solutions of convex Hamiltonian systems and 
non-degenerate star-shaped Hamiltonian systems. In order to study general nonlin-
ear Hamiltonian systems, we have established the iteration theory for the index of 
symplectic paths in our works since 1993. Part IV is devoted to this index iteration 
theory. 
Part IV contains five chapters. In Chapter 8, we establish precise iteration formulae 
for any symplectic paths. In Chapter 9 we study splitting numbers and give its 
algebraic characterization, establish the Bott-type iteration formulae and abstract 
precise iteration formula. These two chapters form the basics for the iteration theory. 
In Chapter 10, we establish various iteration inequalities for any single symplectic 
path. In Chapter 11, we study the common index iteration properties for a finite family 
of symplectic paths. These two chapters give us powerful tools in applications. In 
Chapter 12, we show that this iteration theory also works for closed geodesics on 
Riemannian manifolds. 

Chapter 8 
Precise iteration formulae 
For r > 0, let x : ST = R/(rZ) --* R2n be a r-periodic solution of the nonlinear 
Hamiltonian system 
x = J H'(t, x). 
(1) 
Here we suppose H is C2 along the orbit O(x) = x(R) and r-periodic in time t. We 
define the iteration of the r -periodic function x by 
xm(t) = x(t - jr) , 
jr S t S (j + 1)r, 0 S j S m - 1. 
(2) 
Then xm becomes an mr-periodic solution of the system (1). But geometrically it is 
the same as x. To further our study we consider the linearized Hamiltonian system 
y(t) = J B(t)y(t), 
(3) 
where B == HI! (-, X (.)) E C (ST, .cs (R 2n)). As we have seen before, the fundamental 
solution Yx E P r (2n) of (3) carries significant information about x. For this reason, 
in order to study the sequence {Xm}mEN, for any r > 0 and y E Pr(2n), we extend 
the definition of y to [0, +00) by 
yet) = yet - jr)y(r)i , 
V jr S t S (j + 1)r, j EN, 
(4) 
and define the m-th iteration ym of y by 
ym = yl[O,mr] . 
(5) 
If 8 : [0,1] x [0, r] --* Sp(2n) is a homotopy in the sense of Definition 5.0.3, its 
iteration is defined to be the map 8 : [0, 1] x [0, +00) --* Sp(2n) such that for each 
s E [0,1] the iteration path 8(s,·) is defined by (4) and (5). Note that if y is the 
fundamental solution of the system (3) for some B E C(Sr, .cs (R2n )), then by the 
uniqueness of the initial value problem of (3), the path y coincides with its iteration 
defined by (4) completely on [0, 00). Note that in general the iteration path y 1[0,+(0) 
of (4) need not be C 1 , even if the original path y 1 [0, r] is. 
In order to get more information on r-periodic solutions of the system (1), we 
consider the index function sequence of {ym }mEN. 
Definition 1 For any r > 0, y E Pr (2n), mEN, and (V E U, we define

whenever this limit exists. By Theorems 8.3.1 and 9.3.5 it holds thatt(y, m) is always 
a finite real number. We call this number the mean index per mr of y E P,(2n). 
We also define

Then for any r-periodic solution x of (1), via its associated symplectic path Yx we 
define 
(9) 
t(x, m) = t(yx, m), 
v(x, m) = v(Yx, m) = O. 
(10) 
If the subindex w = 1, we simply write (i(y, m), v(y, m)), (i(x, m), v(x, m)) etc, 
and omit the subindex 1 when there is no confusion. 
Note that (8) follows from the fact that 0 S v(y, m) S 2n for any mEN. 
In this chapter we establish the precise iteration formulae of the index theory for 
any path in P,(2n). By homotopy methods and symplectic additivity of the index 
theory, this study is reduced to certain simple symplectic paths which end at basic 
normal forms introduced in Definition 1.8.9. These basic forms are in Sp(2) or Sp(4). 
In Section 1, we establish the iteration formulae for paths in Sp(2). In Section 2, we 
study the case for hyperbolic paths and elliptic paths in Sp(4). Then in Section 3, 
based on the basic normal form decomposition Theorem 1.8.10, we establish the 
iteration formula for any symplectic paths. Compared with the variational method 
used in the next Chapter 9, the method we used here is completely elementary. 
8.1 
Paths in Sp(2) 
In this section, we study the indices for iterations of any symplectic path in 
Sp(2) ending in basic normal forms. Our study is based upon the results obtained in 
Chapters 1 and 2 on the topological structures of symplectic groups and their subsets. 
For any a E R, we define the functions 
I 
[a] = max{k E Z I k S a}, 
cp(a) = E(a) -
[a], 
E(a) = min{k E Z Ik ~ a}, 
{a}=a-[a]. 
Especially, cp(a) = 0 if a E Z, and cp(a) = 1 if a ¢ Z. 
(1) 
The following lemmas are frequently used in this chapter for our study on iterations. 
Lemma 1 Let a and fJ E P, (2n). Suppose 
a(r) E QO(fJ(r)), 
i(a, 1) = i(fJ, 1). 
(2) 
Thenfor any mEN, 
i(a, m) = i(fJ, m), 
v(a, m) = v(fJ, m). 
(3) 

8.1 Paths in Sp(2) 
179 
Proof: Set r = 1. By (2), there is a path f : [0, 1] --+ nO(,B(1)) such that 
f(O) = a(l) and f(l) = ,B(I). Thus by the inverse homotopy Theorem 6.2.4 and (2), 
it holds that a ~ ,B along f via a homotopy map 8 : [0, 1]2 --+ Sp(2n). Extending 
8 to [0, 1 x [0, m] yields a homotopy from am to ,Bm. Thus by the homotopy 
Theorem 6.2.3 we obtain (3).

By direct computation or using the R3 -cylinderical coordinate representation 
introduced in Section S.I, we obtain the following result.

Lemma 3 Let y E P r (2n) such that y(r) = M\oM2 with Mj E Sp(2nj) and 
nl + n2 = n. Suppose paths Yj E P r (2n j) with j = 1 and 2 satisfy nCr) = Mj 
and iCy, 1) = i(y\, 1) + i(rz, 1). Then for any mEN, 
iCy, m) = i(YI, m) + i(Y2, m), 
v(y, m) = V(YI, m) + V(Y2, m). 
(S) 
(6) 
Proof: Set r = 1. By the inverse homotopy Theorem 6.2.4, Y ~ (YIOY2) with fixed 
points via a homotopy map 8 : [0, 1]2 --+ Sp(2n). Extending this 8 to [0, 1] x [0, m] 
yields a homotopy from ym to (Y\0Y2)m = yroy2". By Theorem 6.2.7, we then 
obtain (S) and (6).

According to the end matrix y(r), we study the iteration of corresponding path 
Y E P r (2) in four cases. Here we use the notation in Section 2.1, and omit the 
subindex (J) when (J) = 1. 
Case 1 The degenerate case Y E P~(2). 
In this case we have the following result. 
Theorem 4 For Y E P~(2), one of the following three cases must happen. 
1° Ify(r) E Sp(2)~, then 
iCy, m) = m(i(y, 1) + 1) - 1, 
v(y, m) = 1, 
VmEN, 
(y, 1) E 2Z + 1, 
iCY, 1) = iCy, 1) + 1. 
2° Ify(r) = I, then 
iCy, m) = m(i(y, 1) + 1) - 1, 
v(y, m) = 2, 
VmEN, 
(y, 1) E 2Z + 1, 
iCy, 1) = iCy, 1) + 1.

iCy, m) = mi(y, 1), 
v(y, m) = 1, 
VmEN, 
iCy, 1) E 2Z, 
iCy, 1) = iCy, 1). 
(11) 
(12) 
Proof: We only prove 10. The other two cases are similar and are left to the readers. 
Without loss of generality, set r = 1. Fix y E P?(2) and extend it to [0, +00]. 
Define 
ys(t) = y(t)R(sp(t)Oo), 
Vt E [0, 1],s E [-1, 1] 
(13) 
wherep(t) = 3t2 -2t3 fort E [0, 1], and 610 > OissosmallsuchthatYs(1) E Sp(2)* 
foralls E [-1, 1]\{0}. Then by our study in Chapter 6, 
i(ys, 1) = i(y-s, 1) + 1 = iCy, 1) + 1, 
Vs E (0, 1], 
(14) 
v(Ys,1) = 0, 
Vs E [-1, 1]\{0}. 
(15) 
In the case of 1°, since y(l) E Sp(2)~, it holds that y-l(1) E Sp(2)-. Thus il(Y) 
must be odd, and by Theorem 1.7.3 there exists P E Sp(2) such that P- 1y(I)P = 
Nl(1,I). Therefore y(1)m E Sp(2)~ and v(y, m) = 1 for all mEN. Choose a 
smooth path h : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2)0 such that h(O) = /, h(l) = y(I), and h(s) E 
Sp(2)~ for all s E (0,1]. For k = iCy, 1) + 1 and this path h, we define a new path 
Ok,h : [0, +(0) ~ Sp(2) by 
! 
Ok,h(t) = h * ¢l,krr(t), 
Vt E [0, 1], 
Ok,h(t) = Ok,h(t - i)y(l)i, 
Vi::::: t ::::: i + 1, i EN. 
(16) 
Using Lemma 2 and Definition 5.1.3 for the case of y(1) E Sp(2)~, we obtain 
yeO) = / = Ok,h(O), 
y(1) = Ok,h(I), 
[ iCy, 1) + IJ 
i(Ok,h, 1) = 2 
2 
- 1 = iCy, 1). 
Thus by Lemma 1, this implies for any mEN: 
iCy, m) = i(Ok,h, m) = 2 [m iCy, ; + 1 J - 1 = mU(y, 1) + 1) - 1. 
Thus (7) and (8) hold.

In Figure 1, the idea of this proof is illustrated. 
Case 2 The case y E P r (2) with a(y(r» = {-I}. 
In this case we refer readers to Figure 2.1.2 for Sp(2)~1 ±. We have the following 
result.

"1m EN, bE R . 
Since the proof of Theorem 5 is similar to that of Theorem 4, it is left to the readers. o 
Case 3 y E PI (2) is truly hyperbolic. 
In this case we have the following result. 
Theorem 6 Suppose y E Pr (2) with y(r) E Spth(2). Then 
i(y, m) = mi(y, 1), 
v(y,m) =0, 
"1m EN, 
(23) 
i(y,1) E 2Z + a(y(r», 
t(y, 1) = i(y, 1), 
(24) 
where a(M) is the hyperbolic index given by Definition 1.8.1. 
Proof: Setr = 1. There are two possibilities according to the signofAfora(y(I» = 
{A, A -I}. We only consider the case of A > O. The other case of A < 0 is left to the 
readers. 
In this case, y(1) E Sp(2)+. Thus i(y, 1) must be even and a(y(1» = O. By 
Theorem 1.7.3, there exists P E Sp(2) such that P- I y(I)P = D(A). Therefore 
(25) 
Then we obtain y(1)m E Sp(2)+ and vm(y) = 0 for all mEN. Choose a smooth 
path h : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2) such that h(O) = /, h(l) = y(1), and h(s) E Sp(2)+ for all 
s E (0, 1]. For k = il and this path h we define a new path 8k,h : [0, +(0) ~ Sp(2) 
by (16). We obtain 
y(O) = / = Ok,h(O), 
y(l) = Ok,h(I),

Then by Lemma 1 this implies

Thus (23) and (24) hold.

Case 4 y E Pr (2) is strongly elliptic. 
In this case we have the following result.

Theorem 7 Suppose y E P,(2) satisfies a(y(r)) = {w, w- I } with w = eRe and 
e E (0, n) U (n, 2n). By Theorem 1.7.3, there exists P E Sp(2) such that 
p-Iy(r)P = R(B) 
with B = e or 2n - e. 
Then for any mEN,

Proof: Set r = 1. In this case, y (1) E Sp(2) -. Thus i (y, 1) must be odd. By (26), 
a(y(m)) = a(y(I)rn) = {wrn , w-rn } for all mEN. Define a path {3 : (0, +(0) ~ 
Sp(2) by 
{3(t) = R(t(i(y, 1) - I)n + tB), 
We obtain yeO) = h = {3(0), and 
\I t 2: O. 
i({3, 1) = 2(((i(y, 1) - l)n + B)/(2n)] + 1 = iCy, 1). 
By (26) there is a path h : (0, 1] ~ QO(y(1)) connecting h(O) = {3(1) to h(1) = 
y(1). Thus by Lemma 1, it suffices to prove (27)-(29) for the path {3. 
If mB =1= 0 mod 2n, (26) yields {3(m) = {3(l)rn rt Sp(2)o. Thus we obtain 
v({3, m) = 0 and 
i({3,m) = 2 [m(i({3, I)2~ I)n +B)] + 1 
= m(i({3, 1) - 1) + 2 [ ~:] + 1, 
\1m EN. 
Noticing E(a) -
[a] = 1 when a rt z, this yields (27)-(29). 
If mB = 0 mod 2n, (26) yields {3 (m) = h We then obtain 
v({3, m) = 2, 
i({3, m) = 2 [ m«i({3, I~: I)n + B)] -
1. 
Thus (27)-(29) hold.

Precise iteration formulae 
8.2 Hyperbolic and elliptic paths 
In this section, we establish the iteration formulae of the index theory for truly 
hyperbolic and hyperbolic paths. Then using these results we study the fifth basic 
case of elliptic paths in Sp(4). 
Fix Y E p;h(2n). By Lemma 2.3.5, there is a path f E C([O, 1], Spth(2n)) such 
that f(O) = yeT) and 
f(l) = M;;, 
iCy, 1) E 2Z, 
if 
a(Y(T)) = 0, 
(1) 
f(1) = M;;, 
iCy, 1) E 2Z + 1, 
if 
a(Y(T)) = 1 
(2) 
where a(Y(T)) is the hyperbolic index of yeT) given by Definition 1.8.1. 
Theorem 1 For any Y E p;h(2n), 
iCy, m) = mi(y, 1), 
v(y, m) = 0, 
"1m EN, 
and then icy, 1) = iCy, 1). 
(3) 
Proof: Set T = 1. Since y(l)m E Spth(2n), we obtain the second equality in (3). 
Define fJ±(t) = D(±(1 + t)) for 0 ::: t ::: 1. Define 
ljr=(fJ+*¢I,k1f)<>fJ~(n-l), 
if a(Y(T)) =0, 
ljr = (fJ- *¢I.krr)<>fJ~(n-2), 
if a(Y(T)) = 1, 
where k = iCy, 1). Then by Lemma 1.1 we obtain 
iCy, m) = i(ljr, m), 
"1m EN. 
(4) 
(5) 
(6) 
Together with Lemmas 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and Theorems 1.6 and 6.2.7, we obtain the first 
equality in (3). 
D 
Fix y E P~(2n). By Lemma 2.3.6, when n ::: 2 there is a path f E C([O,I], 
Sph(2n) n QO(y(T))) such that f(O) = yeT) and 
f(l) = Nl (1, b(y(T))<>M;;_1' 
if 
a(Y(T)) = 0, 
(7) 
f(1) = N) (1, b(y(T))<>M;_I' 
if a(y(T)) = 1, 
(8) 
where (a(y(T), b(Y(T)) is the hyperbolic characterofY(T) given by Definition 2.3.7. 
Note that 
iCy, 1) E 2Z, 
iCy, 1) E 2Z + 1, 
if b(Y(T)) < 0, a(Y(T)) = 0, 
or b(Y(T)) ::: 0, a(y(T)) = 1, 
if b(Y(T)) ::: 0, a(y(T)) = 0, 
or b(Y(T)) < 0, a(Y(T)) = 1.

Theorem 2 For any YEP; (2n) and any mEN,

n 2: 2, (11) follows from the fact that b(y(l)m) = constant for all mEN. Define

(14) 
where k = iCy, 1) + 1 if b(y(l)) = 0 or 1, k = iCy, 1) if b(y(l)) = -1. Then by 
Lemma 1 we also get (11). Together with Theorems 1.6 and 6.2.7, we obtain (12) 
and (13).

Based on Theorem 1 we further consider the following case for elliptic paths in 
addition to the four cases on P T (2) studied in Section 1. 
For any a E R, note that by definition (Ll), the function cp(a) = E(a) -
[a] 
satisfies cp(a) = 0 if a E Z, and cp(a) = 1 if a fj. Z. 
Case 5 y E P T (4) with y(r) = N2(W, b) E Mw(4) for wE U\R. 
Using notation introduced in Lemma 1.9.2, let w = cos 0 + R 
sin 0 with 0 E 
(0, n) U (n, 2n) and b = (:~ :!) E £(R2). We have the following two theorems 
according to N2 (w, b) being non-trivial or trivial. 
Theorem 3 Suppose y E P T (4) satisfies y(r) = N2(W, b) E Mw(4) with w = 
eRe and 0 E (0, n) U (n, 2n). Suppose N2(W, b) is non-trivial, i.e., (b2 - b3) 
sinO < O. Then using thefunction cp(.) E {O, I} defined by (l.1),forany mEN, 
iCy, m) = mi(y, 1) + 2cp (~:) - 2, 
v(y, m) = 2 - 2cp (~:). 
(15) 
Proof: Without loss of generality, let r = 1. By 8° of Lemma 1.9.2, there is a small 
perturbation path f : [0,1] ---+ Sp(4) such that f(O) = N2(W, b) and f(t) possesses 
two distinct pairs of eigenvalues on U sufficiently close to w for all t E (0, 1]. This 
then implies 
iCy, 1) = i(f * y, 1) E 2Z, 
v(y, 1) = O. 
(16) 
To continue our study, we fix an m E N\ {I}.

Precise iteration formulae 
Since N2(W, b) is non-trivial, it can be connected to N2(W, R(e» by a path 17 : 
[0,1] ---+ QO(N2(W, b». Let,8 = 17 * y. Then for k = lor m, we obtain 
i(y, k) = i(,8, k), 
v(y, k) = v(,8, k). 
Thus it suffices to prove (15) for the path,8. Note that 
,8(1)m = N2(W, R(e»m = (R(mo e) 
mR(me») 
R(me) 
, 
"1m EN. 
Thus we obtain 
,8(I)m E Sp(2n)o 
if and only if 
if and only if 
me = 0 mod 2n, 
v(,8, m) = 2. 
By the definition of cp, this implies the second equality of (15). 
For small E > 0 we define 
~(t) = N2(W, R(e»R(tE)o2, 
"It E [-1, 1], 
and let 
~+(t) = ~(t), 
~-(t) = ~(-t), 
"It E [0, 1]. 
Then when E is sufficiently small, by Theorem 6.2.7 we obtain 
i(,8, 1) = i(~_ *,8,1) = i(~+ *,8,1), 
i(,8, m) = i(~_ * (,8m), 1) = i(~_ *,8, m). 
By the computations in Lemma 1.9.2, we obtain 
By Lemma 1.9.1, the sign of the function 
g(sin(tE» == 4A~(t) + 2 -
B~(t), 
"It E [-1, 1],

determines the situation of eigenvalues oH(t). Let s = sin e and s! = sin(tE). Then 
for sufficiently small E > 0 and t E [-1, 1], by the proof of Lemma 1.9.2 we obtain 
g(O) = 0, 
ag 
-(0) = S(b2 - h). 
as! 
Therefore by the condition S(b2 - b3) < 0 and Lemma 1.9.1, ~+(t) possesses four 
eigenvalues outside U and ~-(t) possesses four eigenvalues on U when t E (0,1]. 
Especially, ~+ * ,8 is a truly hyperbolic path in Sp(4). 
Note that by the definition (5.4.6) of perturbation paths (,8m )±! of ,8m, we have 
(24) 

8.2 Hyperbolic and elliptic paths

By Theorems 6.2.4 and 6.2.7, we then obtain 
i «~_ * [3)m, 1) = i «~+ * [3)m, 1) - v([3m, 1). 
(25) 
Applying Theorem 1 to the truly hyperbolic path ~+ * [3, by our above discussion 
we obtain 
i([3,m) = i«~_ * [3)m, 1) 
= i«~+ * [3)m, 1) - v([3m, 1) 
= mi(~+ * [3,1) - v([3, m) 
= mi([3, 1) - v([3, m). 
(26) 
By the second equality of (15), we then obtain the first one of (15) for the 
path [3. 
D 
Theorem 4 Suppose y E P,(4) satisfies yeT) = N2(W, b) E M",(4) with W = 
eRe and e E (0, IT)U(lT, 2lT). Suppose N2(W, b) is trivial, i.e., (b2 -b3) sin e > o. 
Then 
iCy, m) = mi(y, 1), 
v(y, m) = 2 - 2cp (~:). 
(27) 
Proof: Set T = 1. Since N2(W, b) is trivial, it can be connected within QO(N2(W, b» 
to N2(W, - R(e» by a path 17. Let [3 = 17 * y. Then instead of (17) we obtain 
[3(I)m = N2(W, - R(e»m = (R(mi e) 
-mR(me») 
Vm E N. 
(28) 
R(me)

Thus we obtain 
[3(m) = [3(1)m E Sp(2n)o 
if and only if 
if and only if 
me = 0 mod 2lT, 
(29) 
v([3, m) = 2. 
Thus the second equality in (27) holds. U sing notations defined in the proof of 
Theorem 3, since (b2 - b3) sine> 0, the path ~_ * [3 is hyperbolic. Thus by (25), 
(26), and Theorem 1, we obtain 
This proves the first equality in (27).

Remark 3 Theorem 1 and Corollary 2 were proved in [LonI8]. Corollary 2 genera-

Hamiltonian system is always greater than 2. Note that in this case condition (6) 
holds by Corollary 15.1.4 and Lemma 15.2.4 below. 

Chapter 9 
Bott-type iteration formulae 
This chapter is devoted to the establishment and further developments of the 
Bott-type formula for the index theory of iterations of any paths in the symplec-
tic group Sp(2n), starting from the identity matrix and studing its applications. We 
follow the ideas of [Botl] and [LonI6], and base our study upon the index function 
theory introduced in Chapter 5. As a special case, such a formula also works for 
the fundamental solutions of general linear Hamiltonian systems with continuous 
symmetric and periodic coefficients, and thus for periodic solutions of any nonlinear 
Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonian function periodic in time. As a consequence 
of this formula, new index invariants and iteration equalities and inequalities of the 
index theory for symplectic paths are established. 
In Section 1, as the basis of this chapter, we study the splitting numbers and give 
an algebraic characterization for them. In Section 2, the Bott-type formula for the 
I-index theory is proved for iterations of any symplectic paths. New invariants, 
L 2-index character and Fourier index coefficients, especially the mean index, of any 
symplectic path are introduced. In Section 3, based on our complete understanding of 
the splitting numbers and Bott-type formula, we establish an abstract precise iteration 
formula for our index theory and give some corollaries to it. 
9.1 
Splitting numbers 
Fix n E N, r > ° 
and a path y E P r (2n). In this section, we study the properties 
of the index function iw (y) of y at w as a function of w E U, and use the short hand 
notations 
(1) 
when there is no confusion. By Lemma 5.3.1, we obtain 
i(w) = i(w) 
and 
v(w) = v(w), 
Vw E U. 
(2) 
Lemma 1 i (.) is locally constant on U \ a (y (r», and thus is constant on each 
connected component ofU\a(y(r». It holds that 
v(w) = 0, 
Vw E U\a(y(r». 
(3) 
Proof: NotethatUna(y(r» contains at most 2n points. Foranywo E U\a(y(r», 
let N(wo) be an open connected neighborhood of WO in U\a(y(r». By definition 
we obtain v(w) = ° 
for all w E N(wo). Thus (3) holds and YEP; w(2n) for all 
w E N(wo). By Theorem 2.4.1, there is a path fJ : [0,1] -+ P;,wo(2~) connecting 

9.1 Splitting numbers 
191 
Y (T) to M;; or M;;. By the compactness of the image of f3 and the openness of 
Sp(2n)~o in Sp(2n), we can further require N(wo) to be so small that f3 is completely 
located within Sp(2n)~ for all w E N(wo) . Then by definition, this implies i(w) = 
i(wo) for all WE N(wo). 
0 
Corollary 2 The discontinuity points of i (.) and \Jr (-) are contained in un u (y (T)). 
By direct computations we obtain 
Lemma 3 For any M E Sp(2n) and)", E u(M), the algebraic and geometric multi-
plicities and the Krein type of)... E u(N) for any N E [M] are the same as those of 
M , where [M] is the conjugate set of M in Sp(2n) defined in Section 1.8. 
Note that by the above study, for a fixed path y the index i(,,(y) is a step function 
in w E U with possible jumps only at eigenvalues of M = yeT) on U. Next we 
introduce the splitting numbers S"~, (w) to measure the jumps between iw(y) and i).(y) 
for)... E U nearby from two sides of win U. 
Definition 4 For any M E Sp(2n) and w E U, choosing T > 0 and y E Pr (2n) with 
yeT) = M, we define 
(4) 
They are called the splitting numbers of M at w. 
Lemma 5 The splitting numbers S~(w) are well defined, i.e., are independent of the 
path y E PI (2n) appearing in (4). Forw E U and ME Sp(2n), S~(w) are constant 
for any N E QO(M) of Section 1.8. 
Proof: The theorem is proved in the following two claims. 
Claim 1 S~(w) is independent of the path y in its definition. 
In fact, using (5.4.2) for yin (4) and a sufficiently small a > 0, we define 
~a(t) = y(l)Q(-ta, ... , -ta), 
V t E [0, 1]. 
Then we obtain 
iw(y) = iw (~a * y) , 
and by Theorem 2.4.l there is a path f30 : [0,1] -+ Sp(2n)~ which connects ~a(l) 
to M;; or M;;. Choose E > 0 to be small enough such that )...(s) = exp(sE.J=l)w rf. 
u(M) for 0 < s :::: 1. By Lemma 1, i).(s)(Y) = constant for all s E (0,1]. Thus by 
Theorem 2.4.1, there exists a path f3E : [0,1] -+ Sp(2n)~(l) such that f3E(O) = M 
and f3E (1) = M;; or M;;. Thus we obtain

Then st(w) is independent of the choice of y. By Theorem 2.4.2, this number is 
also independent of the choices of the above a > 0 and paths fiE and fio, and then is 
completely determined by M and w. 
Claim 2 S!(w) = S~(w)forany N E QO(M). 
In fact, by the definition of N E QO(M), there exists a path; : [0, 1] --+ Q(M) 
such that ;(0) = M and;(1) = N. Choose any y E P I (2n) such that y(l) = M. 
Then by the definition of Q (M), it holds that y ~ ; * y on [0, 1] along;. Thus by 
Theorem 6.2.7, we obtain 
St/(w) = lim iexp(±£A)w(Y) - iw(Y) 
E--->O+ 
= lim iexp(±EA)w(; * y) - iw(; * y) 
£--->0+ 
= S~(w). 
The proof is complete.

Proof: This is a direct consequence of Definition 4, Theorem 6.2.7, and Lemma 5. o 
In order to give a complete explanation of the splitting number, we use the concept 
of ultimate type of any W E U as an eigenvalue of M E Sp(2n) introduced by 
Definition 1.8.12. 
Theorem 7 For any w E U and M E Sp(2n), 
st(w) = p 
and 
SM(w) = q , 
(8) 
where (p, q) is the ultimate type ofwfor M. 
Proof: By Lemmas 5, 6, and Theorem 1.8.10, it suffices to prove (8) when M is one of 
basicnormalformsNl(±I, b)withb = 1,0, -I,NI{W, b),andN2{w,b) E M~{2n) 
for w E U\R defined in Section 1.8. We continue the proof according to different 
basic normal forms. 
Case 1 M = NI (I, b) with b = ±1 or o. 

9.1 Splitting numbers

Define fb(t) = NI (1, tb) for t E [0, 1]. The matrix M = NI (1, b) is nontrivial 
when b = 1 or 0 and possesses both the Krein type and the ultimate type (1, 1) of 
the eigenvalue 1. The matrix M = N 1 (1, -1) is trivial, and possesses the Krein type 
(1,1) and the ultimate type (0, 0) ofthe eigenvalue 1. Then using the R3 cylindrical 
coordinate representation introduced in Section 2.1, it is easy to see that for any E > 0 
sufficiently small, 
il(fb) = -1, 
iexp(±EFf)(fb) = 0, 
if b = 1 or 0, 
and il(f-j) = 0, 
iexp(±EFf)(f-I) = O. 
Thus (8) holds when w = 1. 
Case 2 M = NI ( -1, b) with b = ± 1 or O. 
The proof of the case of w = -1 is similar by using the R 3 -cylindrical coordinate 
representation and is left to the readers. 
Case 3 M = R(B) or R(2TC - B) with w = eeFf E U\R. 
Fixw = eeFf E U\R. By Lemma 6 it suffices to prove (8) forB E (0, TC) U (TC, 2TC) 
and M = R(B). Fix a path Y E PI (2) in Definition 4 with y(l) = R(B). 
When B E (0, TC), note that (J (R(B)) consists of two simple eigenvalues wand w. 
By direct computation, R(B) possesses (p, q) = (0, 1) as the Krein type and ultimate 
type of w. 
On the other hand, let A(±E) = exp(±Ey'=1)W with E > 0 sufficiently small. 
When B E (0, TC), the matrix Y-J (1) can be connected to D(2) within Sp(2)t, where 
Y-J is the perturbation path of Y defined by (5.4.6) with respect to w. Note also that 
the matrix R(B) can be connected to D(2) within Sp(2)t(E)' and the matrix R(B) can 
be connected to D(-2) within Sp(2)):"(_E)" Thus 
i(A(-E)) = i(w) + 1, 
i(A(E)) = i(w). 
(9) 
Therefore we obtain (8). 
When B E (TC, 2TC), similarly the matrix Y-I (1) can be connected to D( -2) within 
Sp(2)~, the matrix R(B) can be connected to D( -2) within Sp(2)):"CE)' and the matrix 
R(B) can be connected to D(2) within Sp(2)tC_E)" Thus (8) still hold. 
Next we continue our study for M = N2(W, b) E M1(4) with w = eeFf E 
U\R in two cases. By Lemma 6, it suffices to consider the case of N2(W, b) with 
B E (0, TC) U (TC, 2TC). In the following we always suppose B E (0, TC). The case of 
B E (TC, 2TC) can be studied similarly and is left to the readers. 
Case 4 M = N2(W, b) E M1(4) and (b2 - b3) sin B < O. 
Since N2(W, b) is non-trivial, by direct computation we obtain that was an eigen-
value of M possesses both the Krein type and the ultimate type (1, 1).

Define

Then denoting s = sine, c = cose, SI = sin«t - l)ct) and CI = cos«t - l)ct) for 
j = 1 and 2, we obtain that for sufficiently small ct > ° 
and t E [0, 1), 
where SI = sin«t - l)ct) < 0. Here the condition S(b2 -
b3) < ° 
is crucial. Thus by 
Lemma 1.9.2, forO:::; t < 1 the matrix ~(t) possesses two pairs of simple eigenvalues 
{AI (t), Al (t), )dt), A2(t)} such that for j = 1 and 2, A j E C([O, 1], U), A j(l) = w, 
Aj(t) i= wand IAj(t) - wi is sufficiently small provided ct > ° 
is small enough for 
t E [0,1). Denote by Aj(t) = exp(.8j(t),J=n with.8j E C([O, 1], R) for j = 1 
and 2, and .81 (1) = .82(1) = e . Note that ~(t) is the fundamental solution of the 
system (8.0.3) with B(t) = -J~(t)~(t)-I being positive definite. So by Theorem 
1.3.11 when ° :::; t < 1, Al (t) and A2(t) must have different Krein type. Without loss 
of generality, for ° :::; t < 1 we assume thatAl (t) is Krein negative and A2(t) is Krein 
positive. By Theorem 1.3.11 again, we obtain 
.81 (t) > e > .82(t), 
\/O:::;t<l, 
(14) 
and .81 (t) and .82(t) are strictly decreasing and increasing respectively when t 
increases to 1. 
By (12), we have ~(O) E Sp(4);. Thus there is a path 7] : [0,1] --+ Sp(2n); 
connecting 7](0) = D( -2)<>D(2) to 7](1) = ~(O). Denote by 1/! = al the standard 
zigzag path defined by (5.3.17). Then 1/! connects 14 to D( -2)<>D(2) and i,,(1/!) = 1 
for all A E U. Thus

Define

Denote S and c as in (12). For any b E [-ct, 0], let SI = sine -ct), C] = cos( -ct), 
S2 = sin b, C2 = cos b. By Lemma 1.9.2 we further require ct > ° 
to be so small such

where (b2 - b3)sine < 0 is used. Thus M[R( -a)oh] and M[R( -a)oR( -a)] can 
be connected within Sp(4)~. This proves Y-l ~w 1]*1/J, where Y-l is the perturbation 
path of Y defined by (5.4.6). Thus

By (14) and the discussion there, Al (r) and A2(r) are Krein positive and negative res-
pectively. By (20) and (21), both.81 (r) and .82(r) are in (0, n). Thus by Theorem 1.7.3 
there exists P E Sp(4) such that P~(r)p-l = R(2n -
.81(r))oR(.82(r)). Let

Bott-type iteration formulae 
P E Pl(4) satisfy p(l) = P. Define s(t) = p(t)~(r)p(t)-l for all t E [0,1]. Then 
the conjugate path s connects ~(r) to R(2rr - fh (r))<>R (fh (r)). Define 
ft(t) = R(t(2rr -
f31(r))), 
h(t) = R(tf32(r)), 
f(t) = ft<>h(t), 
V t E [0, 1]. 
(23) 
By (14), it holds that fh (r) > () > f32(r). Thus by Theorem 6.2.7 and a direct 
computation for paths in Sp(2), we obtain 
iw(f) = 1 + ° 
= 1, 
iX(E)(f) = 2 + ° 
= 2, 
iX(-E)(f) = 1 + 1 = 2. 
By (15) and the definitions of ~ and S we obtain

In Figure 2, this computation is intuitively explained via the R 3-cylindrical rep-
resentation of Sp(2) on the plane {z = O}, where ft and h are represented by two 
nearby paths with the same topological properties. Since S * ~ * TJ * 1jr(I) = f(1), 
by inverse homotopy Theorem 6.2.4, (24), and (26), we obtain S * ~ * TJ * 1jr '" f on 
[0, 1] with fixed end points. Since S is a conjugation path, this implies ~ * TJ * 1jr '" JL f 
on [0, 1] along S for any J1 E U. Then by Theorem 6.2.3 and (25) we obtain

Together with (22) we obtain 
(28) 
By (18), (19), and (28), we obtain 
S1f(w) = SM(w) = 1, 
(29) 
i.e., (8) holds in this case. 
Case 5 M = N2(W, b) E M~(4) and (b2 - b3) sine> O. 
Since in this case M is trivial, by direct computation we obtain that W as an eigen-
value of M possesses the Krein type (1, 1) and the ultimate type (0,0). 
Define the path ~ : [0, 1] ~ Sp(4) by (10) for some small a E (0, e /2]. By the 
notation of Case 4, we obtain that for sufficiently small a > 0 and t E [0, 1) as in 
(12) and (13), 
Dw(~(t)) < 0, 
4A~(t) + 2 -
B~ (t) < 0, 
(30) 
where Sl = sin«t - l)a) < O. Here the condition S(b2 - b3) > 0 is crucial. By 
Lemma 1.9.1, this implies 
a(~(t)) n (U U R) = 0, 
V t E [0, 1). 
(31) 
Similar to our study in Case 1, by (30) we obtain that Mi can be connected to ~ (0) 
by a path 1'] : [0, 1] ~ Sp(2n) satisfying 
a (1'](t)) n U = 0, 
V t E [0,1]. 
(32) 
Define 1/1 = ao of Section 5.3. Then 1/1 connects 14 to Mi and satisfies iA (1/1) = 0 
for all A E U. Together with (32), 
iw(1'] * 1/1) = o. 
(33) 
Similar to the proof of (18), using Lemma 1.9.2, we get that for y = ~ * 1'] * 1/1, 
(34) 
Fix E > 0 so small that (19) holds for X (±E) = e±EPw E U\R. By (33) and (34), 
X (±E) <t a (y (t)) for 0 :::: t :::: 1. Since y passes through Mi, we obtain 
iX(±E)(Y) = O. 
(35) 
Then together with (19) and (34) we obtain 
S1f(w) = SM(w) = 0, 
(36) 
i.e., (8) holds in this case. 
The proof is complete.

Theorem 10 The integer valued splitting number pair (S1/(w), S;(w)) defined for 
all (w, M) E U x Un2:1Sp(2n) are uniquely determined by the following axioms: 
1° (Homotopy invariant) Stf(w) = S~(w)forall N E QO(M). 
2° (Symplectic additivity) Stfl OM2 (w) = Stfl (w) + Stf2 (w) for all Mi E Sp(2ni) 
with i = 1 and 2. 
3° (Vanishing) Stf(w) = 0 ijw ¢ u(M). 
4 ° (Normality) (S1/ (w), S; (w)) coincides with the ultimate type of w for M when 
M is any basic normalform given by Definition 1.8.9. 
Our Theorems 7 and 10 give a complete understanding of the splitting numbers for 
all M E Sp(2n). Consequently, the ultimate type is also characterized by Theorem 10. 
Proposition 11 For any w E U and M E Sp(2n), denote the Krein type of w E u (M) 
by (Pw(M), qw(M)). Then 
o :s vw(M) - S;(w) :s Pw(M), 
O:s vw(M) - S1/(w) :s qw(M).

Proof: The left inequality follows from Corollary 9. To prove the right inequality in 
(39), note that by Theorems 1.8.10 and 10, it suffices to prove (39) for basic normal 
forms. Then (39) follows from the direct verifications for basic normal forms as in 
our study in the cases of the proof for Theorem 7, which are left to the readers.

List 12 For the reader's convenience, we list the splitting numbers below for all basic

Remark 13 Splitting numbers for symplectic matrices and results in this section were 
introduced and obtained in [LonI6] of 1999. Proposition 11 is new. These results 
generalize those obtained by R. Bott in [Botl] and I. Ekeland in [Eke3]. 
9.2 Bott-type formulae 
Based on the index function theory of Chapter 5, we are able to establish the following 
Bott-type formula of the index theory for iterations of any path y E Pr (2n). 
Theorem 1 For any r > 0, y E Pr (2n), z E U, and mEN, 
iz(y, m) = L i",(y) , 
(1) 
wm=z 
I!z(y, m) = L I!w(y). 
(2) 
wm=z 
Proof: We only prove the case z = 1. Other cases can be proved similarly. Based 
on the results of Chapters 5 and 6, we prove Theorem 1 in two steps. Without loss 
of generality, we set r = 1. We consider first the case for the fundamental solution 
y E P\(2n) of (6.1.4) for any linear Hamiltonian system (6.1.1) with symmetric 
continuous and periodic coefficients. Then the case of any path y E Pl (2n) is 
reduced to the case of PI (2n). We use the notation introduced in Chapters 5 and 6. 
Step 1 Let m and kEN with k ::; m, r > 0 and w E U. We define Lm to be the 
Hilbert space L 2([0, mr], C 2n ) with the usual L 2 inner product (., .) L, and 
Wm(k, w) = {y E W1,2([0, mr], C 2n ) I y(kr) = wy(O)} 
(3) 
with the usual W I,2 norm which forms a subspace of Lm. We write Wm = Wm(m, 1). 
Fix BE C(Sl, L s(R2n )). Using the operators A and B introduced in Section 6.1, 
we define 
w 
1 
fm ,k(y) = 2(A - B)y, y)L, 
Vy E Wm(k, w) , 
(4) 
and we write f m = f ~ ,m for simplicity. Then f:::,k is smooth in the induced topology 
of Lm.

Let y : [0, +(0) --+ Sp(2n) be the fundamental solution of (8.0.3) with B given 
above. The bilinear form <Pm on Wm corresponding to the functional 1m is given by 
Vx,y E domA = Wm eLm. 
Two subspaces F1 and F2 of W m are <Pm -orthogonal and is denoted by F1 ..1 F2, if 
it holds that <Pm (x, y) = 0 for all x E F1 and Y E F2. We denote by F1 EB F2 the 
<Pm-orthogonal product of F1 and F2.

origin by m*(m, w) for * = +,0, and - respectively. Then m*(m, w) coincides with 
m*(I, w). Denote the dimensions of Zm and Zm(l, w) by 2dm and 2dm,w respectively. 
Then from (7) and (8) we obtain 
m*(m) = L m*(m, w) 
wm=I

for * = +,0, -.

Note that the dimensions of the spaces Zm and Zm (l, w) satisfy

Combining (9), (10), and Theorem 6.1.1, we have proved the special case of Theorem 1 
whenever Y E PI (2n). 
Step 2 The case of Y E PI (2n). 
Fix Y E PI (2n). By the method of Step 2 in the proof of Theorem 6.1.8, we can 
choose a path ljr E PI (2n) such that ljr 'V Y with fixed end points. This homotopy 
can be extended to [0, 1] x [0, m] for any mEN. Thus we obtain 
"1m EN. 
(11) 
Specially, by Theorem 6.2.7, for all mEN and wED we obtain 
iw(Y, m) = iw(ljr, m), 
Vw(Y, m) = vw(ljr, m). 
(12) 
Together with (1) and (2) for ljr, we obtain them for y and complete the proof of 
Theorem 1. 
0 
Remark 3 Theorem 1 can also be proved by firstly perturbing y to a nearby path a such 
that a(r) possesses only simple eigenvalues. This reduces the proof of Theorem 1 
to symplectic paths in Sp(2) and Sp(4). Then using our method in Chapter 8, the 
formulae (1) and (2) can be established directly. 
As a direct consequence of Theorem 1, we obtain the Bott-type formulae for split-
ting numbers.

Riemannian sums, and converge to the corresponding integrals as m ~ 00.

By our study on iw(y) as a function on w E U for fixed y E P,(2n), it is a step 
function with only finitely many jumps. Suggested by the mean index i(y, 1), we 
introduce the following sequence of new invariants for elements in P, (2n).

Then as an L 2(V, R)-function, we call I y,! the L 2-index character of y per r. For

Ao(y, m) = 2Co(y, m),

We call these Cdy, 1), Ak(Y, 1), and Bk(y, 1) the k-th Fourier index coefficients 
of y per r.

20 For r > 0 and y E Pr (2n), the L2-index character Iy ,1 of y per r is com-
pletely determined by the Fourier index coefficients ofy per r.

Note that the new concepts introduced in Definition 6 can be defined naturally 
for any r-periodic solution x of the nonlinear Hamiltonian system (8.0.1) with the 
Hamiltonian function H E C2 along x(R) and r-periodic in t through the fundamen-
tal solution Yx of the linearized Hamiltonian system (8.0.3) with B(t) = H" (t, x(t)). 
Remark 8 Bott-type index iteration formulae and the mean index of any symplectic 
matrix path, as well as results contained in this section, were introduced or obtained

in [Lon16] except Corollary 4 which is due to [LLZ1]. The L2-index character and 
Fourier index coefficients given by Definition 6 are new and further generalize the 
mean index. So far, only the mean index has been used in our applications to nonlinear 
problems. We believe that the other concepts in Definition 6 should also be useful, 
since they in fact characterize greatly Morse-type information of the given periodic 
solution. 
9.3 Abstract precise iteration formulae 
For any ME Sp(2n), we define 
C(M) = L 
SM(eRO ). 
(1) 
0<0<2rr 
Since SM(w) = 0 if W f/. a(M), then (1) is a finite sum. 
The main result in this section is the following abstract precise iteration formula. 
Theorem 1 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For any path y E P r (2n), let M = Y (r). 
We extend y to [0, +(0) by (8.0.4). Thenforany mEN we have

Proof: Set r = 1 and fix a path y E PI (2n). Let M = y(1). As mentioned in 
Section 1, the splitting numbers S~(w) measure the jumps between i",(y) and i),(y) 
with A E U near W from two sides of win U. Therefore for any Wo = eRoo E U 
with 0 :s eo < 277:, we denote by W j with 1 :s j :s po the eigenvalues of M on U 
which are distributed counterclockwise from 1 to wo and located strictly between 1 
and WOo Then we have 
Po

By Lemma 1.6 on splitting numbers, regrouping terms in the last expression of (4) 
according to SM(w) with WE U, we get

Since E(a) + [b] = a + b if a, bE R and a + bE Z, from (5) we obtain

Remark 3 It is easy to verify that the iteration formulae (8.3.2) and the above (2)

Note that 2° of Corollary 8.3.2 can also be proved similarly by the above Corollary 2. 
The following formula gives the parity of i(y, m) in terms of i(y, 1) = il(Y), 
i-l(Y), and the iteration time m.

Remark 5 The abstract iteration formula Theorem 1 was established by C. Zhu and 
the author in [LZu3]. Theorem 4 is proved in [HuLl] of Xijun Hu and the author, 
which generalizes Proposition 6.14 ofViterbo in [Vit3] of 1989, where the iteration 
formula (9) was proved for indices of iterations of any periodic solution of star-shaped 
Hamiltonian systems under the condition that the periodic solution and all its iterations 
are non-degenerate. 

Chapter 10 
Iteration inequalities 
Usually in applications to differential equations of the index theory, only certain 
iteration inequalities are needed. In this chapter, based upon our results in Chapters 8 
and 9, we establish various iteration inequalities. 
In fact, our precise iteration formula (8.3.2) yields a simple way to detect any 
proposed iteration inequality of the index theory, i.e., plugging the ten formulae 
obtained in Theorems 8.1.4-8.1.7 and 8.2.3-8.2.4 for the ten basic normal forms to 
see if the inequality holds. These ten formulae suggest corrections one should make 
if the proposed inequality does not hold, and further improvements if the proposed 
inequality does hold. The abstract precise iteration formula (9.3.1) together with 
the complete understanding of Theorem 9.1.7 on splitting numbers also can play the 
same role. In this sense, the iteration theory of the index defined in Chapter 5 is 
completely established. 
In Section 1, we derive inequalities on the increasing of i (y, m) in terms of mean 
index, or initial index, and iteration times. In Section 2, we derive estimates on 
successive iterations. In Section 3, we derive estimates on the iteration times via 
known information on indices. These inequalities and estimates will be applied to 
various problems on periodic solutions of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems in Part V 
of this book. 
10.1 Estimates via mean index and initial index 
Based on our studies of the index function theory in Chapters 5 and 6, and the Bott-
type formula in Chapter 9, in this section we establish various iteration inequalities 
of the index theory for symplectic paths. In the following we denote by U+ and U-
the closed upper and lower semi-circles in U respectively. 
Theorem 1 (C. Liu and Y. Long [LLol], [LLo3]). 1° For any y E P,(2n) and 
W E U \ {I}, it always holds that 
il (y) + VI (y) - n :S iw(Y) :S il (y) + n - vw(Y)· 
(1) 
2° The left equality in (1) holds for some wE U+\ {I} (or U- \ {I}) if and only if 
hpoNI (1, -l)0q oK E QO(y(r» for some non-negative integers p and q satisfying 
o :S p + q :S nand K E Sp(2(n -
p - q» with cr(K) c U\ {l} satisfying the 
condition that all eigenvalues of K located within the arc between 1 and w including 
win U+ \ {lHor U- \ {I}) possess total multiplicity n -
p - q. If w i= -1, all 
eigenvalues of K are in U\R and those in U+\R (or U+\R) are all Krein-negative

for some non-negative integers sand t satisfying 0 :::; s + t :::; n - p - q, and some 
H E Sp(2(n - p - q - s - t» statisfying a(H) C U\R and that all elements in 
a(H) n U+(or a(H) n U-) are all Krein-negative (or Krein-positive) definite. 
3° The left equality in (1) holdsforall W E U\{I} ifand only if hpoNI (1, _1)<>(n-p) 
E g.o(y(r» for some integer p E [0, n]. Especially in this case, all the eigenvalues 
ofy(r) are equal to 1 and VI (y) = n + p ~ n. 
4° The right equality in (1) holds for some W E U+ \{ 1}( or U- \ {I}) if and only 
if hpoNI (1, 1)<>r oK E nO(y(r» for some non-negative integers p and r satisfying 
o :::; p + r :::; nand K E Sp(2(n -

condition that all eigenvalues of K located within the closed arc between 1 and W in 
U+\{l}(orU-\{I}) possess total multiplicity n - p-r. Ifw i= -1, all eigenvalues in 
a(K) n U+(or a(K) n U-) are all Krein positive (or negative) definite. If w = -1, 
it holds that -hsoNI (-1, 1)<>toH E nO(K) for some non-negative integers sand t 
satisfying 0:::; s + t :::; n - p - r, and some H E Sp(2(n - p - r - s - t» satisfying 
a(H) c U\R and that all elements in a(H) n U+(ora(H) n U-) are all Krein 
positive (or negative) definite. 
5° The right equality in (1) holdsforall w E U\ {I} ifandonly if hpoNt (1, 1)<>(n-p) 
E nO(y(r» for some integer p E [0, n]. Especially in this case, all the eigenvalues 
ofy(r) must be 1, and VI (y) = n + p ~ n. 
6° Both equalities in (1) hold for all w E U \ {I} if and only if y (r) = hn. 
Proof: We only consider the case for W E U+ \ {I}. The proof for W E U- \ {I} is 
similar and omitted. Without loss of generality, we set r = 1. Fix y E PI (2n) and 
W E U+. It is proved in Section 1.8 that y(l) can be connected within its homotopy 
component nO (y ( 1» to a matrix M which is a o-product of normal forms, 
(2) 
where p, q and r are non-negative integers satisfying p + q + r :::; n, Nt (1, b) is a 
normal form belonging to the eigenvalue 1 with b = ± 1 defined in Section 1.4, and 
K E Sp(2(n - p - q - r» satisfies 1 rt a(K). We continue our proof in six steps. 
Step 1 The proof of the left inequality in (1). 
Note that S:(I)(1) = S;(1) (1). Denote by WI, ... , Wk E U all the eigenvalues of 
y (1) that lie on the open arc between I and W in U+. By the definition of the splitting 
numbers we obtain 
k 
iw(y) = il(Y) + S:(I)(1) -
~)S;(l)(Wj) - S:(I)(Wj)] - S;(I)(w). 
(3) 
j=1 
We continue the proof in two cases. 
Case 1 q = 0 in (2). 

10.1 Estimates via mean index and initial index 
In this case, by our discussion on splitting numbers in Section 9.1, we have 
2S;(1)(l) = 2p + 2r 2: 2p + r = VI(Y). 
By (3), (4), and our study in Section 9.1, we obtain 
k 
i,u(y) 2: il(Y) + S;(1)(1) - LS;(1)(Wj) - s;(1)(w) 
j=l 
k 
211 
(4) 
2: il(Y) + VI(Y) - S;(1)(l) - L 
s;(1/Wj) - s;(l)(W) 
(5) 
2: il(Y)+VI(y)-n. 
Thus the left inequality of (1) holds in this case. 
Case 2 q > 0 in (2). 
j=l 
Suppose q = 1. By our study in Chapters 5, 6, and (2), there are paths YI E PI (2) 
and Y2 E PI(2n - 2) such that Y ~ YIOY2 with YI(l) = NI(1, -1) and Y2(1) = 
hpoNI(1, l)'>roK. Thus VI(YI) = 1, il(YI) E 2Z, and 
iw(YI) = il(n) = il(YI) + VI (YI) -1. 
By symplectic additivity of iw and iI, the proof of the left inequality in (1) is 
reduced to 
iw(Y2) 2: il (Y2) + VI (Y2) -
(n - 1). 
Now we can apply Case 1 to the path Y2 to get (1). 
When q 2: 2, by induction and our study above we obtain the left inequality of (1). 
Step 2 The proof of the right inequality in (1). 
Similar to Step 1, by (3) and our study in Section 9.1 
k 
iw(Y) + vw(Y) :s il (y) + S;(l) (1) + L 
S;(I) (Wj) 
j=l 
+ [vw(Y) - S;(1)(w)]. 
If W f=- -1, from (6), vw(Y) = v,;:,(y), and our study in Section 9.1, we obtain 
k 
iw(Y)+vw(Y):S il(Y) +S;(1)(l) + LS;(1)(Wj)+vw(Y) 
j=l 
:Sil(y)+n. 
If W = -1, similar to (2) it holds that

Iteration inequalities 
for some non-negative integers s, t, and u satisfying s + t + usn, and some 
H E Sp(2(n - p -q -r -s -t -u» satisfying -1 ¢ a(H). From this representation 
and our discussion in Section 9.1, we obtain 
(9) 
Together with (6), we obtain the right inequality of (1). Thus the right inequality of 
(1) always holds. 
Note that the proofs of sufficiency parts of 2° to 5° follow by direct verifications, 
and therefore are omitted. 
Step 3 The proof of 2°. 
Suppose the left equality of (1) holds for the given W E U+ \ {I}. When q = 0 in 
(2), all equalities must hold in (5). This then implies 
k L S:(I) (Wj) = 0, 
j=1 
k 
S:(I)(1) + L S;(I) (Wj) + S;(l)(w) = n. 
j=1 
(10) 
(11) 
(12) 
Thus 2° holds. When q ::: 1, by an induction argument as in the proof of Case 2 in 
Step 1, we get the necessity part of 2°. 
Step 4 The proof of 3°. 
When q = 0 in (2), since W can range over all ofU+\{I}, by 2° all the eigenvalues 
of y(I) must be equal to 1 and (10) to (12) must hold. This implies VI (y) = 2n. 
Thus y (1) = hn. When q ::: 1, by induction we get the necessity part of 3° . 
Step 5 The proof of 4°. 
Suppose the right equality of (1) holds for the given W E U+ \ {l}. 
If W =J=. -1, all equalities must hold in (6) and (7). This yields 
k L S;(I) (Wj) = 0, 
j=1 
k 
S:(I)(I) + L S:(I/Wj) + v",(y) = n. 
j=1 
(13) 
(14) 
(15) 

10.1 Estimates via mean index and initial index 
213 
By our discussion in Section 9.1, (15) implies q = ° 
in (2). Together with our study 
in Section 9.1, we obtain the necessity part of 4° in this case. 
If W = -1, all equalities must hold in (6). This yields (13) and 
k 
S;(l/I) + L S;CI) (Wj) + vw(y) - S;Cl)(w) = n. 
j=l 
(16) 
By our discussion in Section 9.1, (16) implies q = ° 
in (2) and u = ° 
in (8). Together 
with our study in Section 9.1, we obtain the necessity part of 4° in this case. 
Step 6 The proof of 5°. 
Since W can range over all of U+ \ {I}, by 4° all the eigenvalues of y (1) must be 1 
and equalities in (6) must hold. This implies S+(l) (1) = n. Thus in (2) it must hold 
that p + r = nand q = 0, i.e., the necessity p~ of 5° holds. 
6° is a direct consequence of 3° and 5°. The proof is complete.

Theorem 2 (C. Lin and Y. Long [LLol], [LLo3]). 1° For any y E Pr (2n) and 
mEN, 
mi(y, 1) - n ~ iCy, m) ~ mi(y, 1) + n - v(y, m). 
(17) 
2° The right equality in (17) holds for all mEN if and only if lzpoNl 
(1, _1)0Cn- p) E QO(y(r» for some integer p E [0, n]. Especially in this 
case, all the eigenvalues ofy(r) are equal to 1 and v(y, 1) = n + p 2: n. 
3° The left equality in (17) holdsforall mEN if and only if lzqoNl (1, l)oCn-q) E 
QO(y(r)) for some integer q E [0, n]. Especially in this case, all the eigen-
values ofy(r) are equal to 1 and v(y, 1) = n + q 2: n. 
4 ° Both equalities in (17) hold for all mEN if and only if y (r) = lzn. 
Proof: Set r = 1. By Theorem 9.2.5, integrating (1) on U we obtain 
iCy, 1) + v(y, 1) - n ~ iCy, 1) ~ iCy, I) + n. 
(18) 
Replacing r = 1 by m in (18), (9.2.25) yields (17). The right (left) equality in (17) 
holds if and only if the left (right) equality in (1) holds for all W E U \(a(y(r)) U {I}). 
Thus 2°--4° follow from Theorem 1. 
0 
Note that by Theorems 8.1.4-8.1.7 and 8.2.3-8.2.4, the necessary and sufficient 
conditions in terms of the basic normal form decomposition of y (r) can be given for 
the right or left equality in (17) to hold for some mEN. The details are left to the 
readers.

Proof: Set r = 1. By Theorem 9.2.1 with z = 1, summing (1) over all m-th roots 
of unity, we obtain 
m(i(y, 1) + v(y, 1) - n) + iCy, 1) :s iCy, m) 
:s (m - 1)(i(y, 1) + n) + iCy, 1) - (v(y, m) - v(y, 1». 
This yields (19). The equality conditions follow from Theorems 6.2.7,8.1.4-8.1.7, 
and 8.2.3-8.2.4.

Remark 5 I. Ekeland proved the following iteration inequality for his index theory 
in Theorem 1.5.1 of [Eke3] for any y E [,(2n) defined in Remark 15.1.5 below:

Note that by Theorem 15.1.6 proved in [LonI6], this inequality follows from the 
right-hand side inequality in 1° of our above Theorem 3 immediately. Note that the 
left-hand side in 1 ° of Theorem 3 can also be used to prove (20). 
Note that by Theorem 7.3.1, the above Theorem 2 improves an estimate of 
H.B. Rademacher in [Radl] of 1989. 
Remark 6 Both of the first parts of Theorems 1 and 2 were established by C. Liu 
and the author in [LLol] of 1997. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the 
equalities in Theorems 1-3 in this section were proved by C. Liu and the author in 
[LL03] of 2000. Here we have made some necessary corrections for certain errors in 
[LL03].

The following estimate is basic for our iteration inequalities below.

all eigenvalues in A n u(M). For any W E u(M) n U, denote its Krein type by 
(Pw(M) , qw(M». Since A is symmetric with respect to R, so is A'. Therefore by 
Lemma 1.3.8, we have

The following result is a direct corollary of Theorem 2. We give an independent 
proof to show how to use precise iteration formulae obtained in Chapter 8 to detect 
and prove possible iteration inequalities. 
Theorem 3 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For y E P,(2n), set M = yeT) and 
extend y to [0, +(0) by (8.004). Thenfor any mEN,

i a iteration inequalities 
Proof: Without loss of generality, we set T = 1. 
By Theorem 1.8.10, there exist J E C([O, 1], QO(M)) and basic normal forms 
MI, ... , Mp E Sp(2) and NI, ... , Nq E Sp(4) such that J(O) = M and 
(12) 
Since Sp(2n) is path connected, we can pick up paths ~i E PI (2) and 'fJ j E PI (4) 
such that ~i(1) = Mi and 'fJj(I) = Nj for 1 :'S i :'S p and 1 :'S j :'S q. 
For k E Z, we define a new path {J E PI (2n) by 
{J = I 
(~I * <P1.2krr )<>~2<> ... ~ p<>'f)I <> ... <>'fJq, 
('fJI * (<PI,2k:rr<>h))<>'fJ2<>'" <>'fJq, 
if p ~ 1, 
if p = 0, 
(13) 
where <PI.e is defined by (5.1.1). By this construction and the definition of J(I), we 
have 
v({J, I) = v(y, 1), 
e({J(I)) = e(f(I)) :'S e(M). 
(14) 
Since the curve J is in QO(M), we can fix a k E Z in (13) such that 
i({J, 1) = iCy, I). 
(15) 
Thus by the inverse homotopy Theorem 6.2.4, 
{J ~I Y 
on [0, 1] along f. 
(16) 
Extending this homotopy to [0, 1] x [0, m] for any mEN, we have 
(17) 
where Jm(s) = J(s)m for any s E [0, 1]. Then by Theorem 6.2.3, we obtain 
i({J, m) = iCy, m), 
v({J, m) = v(y, m), 
"1m EN. 
(18) 
So by (14) and (18), it suffices to prove (11) for the path {J. 
Note that all terms in the two inequalities in (11), except the elliptic height e(y(l), 
are symplectic additive and homotopy invariant. When we consider the path {J, the 
elliptic height is also additive in terms of the decomposition of {J(I) = J(I) in (12). 
Thus by (12), (14), and Theorem 6.2.7, the proofs of both inequalities in (11) for 
the path {J are reduced to those for each component path of {J in (13), i.e., any path 
in PI (2) or PI (4) ending at a basic normal form of symplectic matrices defined in 
Section 1.8. 
Next we continue our proof for paths ending at these normal forms in eight cases 
according to all the different patterns of iteration formulae. 
Case 1 y E PI (2) and M == y(l) = Nl(l, b) with b = 1 orO.

Suggested by the study in Case 1 with b = 1 of the proof of Theorem 3, we have 
the following result, which is useful for the study of closed characteristics on convex 
as well as star shaped hypersurfaces in R 2n. 
Theorem 4 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For any y E P,(2n), set M = y(r) 
and extend y to [0, +00) by (8.0.4). Suppose that there exist P E Sp(2n) and Q E 
Sp(2n - 2) such that

Proof: Without loss of generality, we set r = 1. 
Using the path ¢I,(i given in (5.1.1), for k E Z we define

10.3 Controlling iteration numbers via indices 
223 
Since Sp(2n - 2) is path connected, there is a path 1] E PI (2n - 2) such that 1] (1) = Q. 
By (23), we can fix a k E Z so that 
2k - 1 + i(1], 1) = i(~, 1) + i(1], 1) = i(y, 1). 
(26) 
Pick up a path g E PI (2n) such that g(l) = P. Define 
h(s) = g(s)-I Mg(s) , 
"It E [0, 1]. 
Then h connects M = y(1) to NI (1, 1)<>Q = (~<>1])(1) within QO(M). Thus by the 
inverse homotopy Theorem 6.2.4, we have 
Y ~I (~<>1]) on 
[0,1] 
along 
h. 
By extending this homotopy map to [0,1] x [0, m] via iteration, we obtain 
Y ~l (~<>1]) 
on 
[O,m] 
along 
hm, 
where hm(s) = h(s)m. Therefore by Theorem 6.2.7 and (26), for any mEN we 
obtain 
e(M) = e(Nl(1, 1)) + e(Q) = 2 + e(Q), 
i(y, m) = i(~, m) + i(1], m) = 2mk - 1 + i(1], m), 
V(y, m) = v(~, m) + v(1], m) = 1 + v(1], m). 
Thus plugging (27)-(29) into (22), they become 
e(Q) 
v(1], m) - -2-
:::: i(1], m + 1) - i(1], m) - i(1], 1)

3° There exists a path y E P r (2n) satisfying conditions in 2° such that (7) and

Proof: 1° By (7) and the first inequality of (1.19), we obtain 
> iCy, m) 
~ m(i(y, 1) + v(y, 1) - n) + n - v(y, 1) 
= (m - 1)(i(y, 1) + v(y, 1) - n) + iCy, 1)

2° If m = 2 holds, (10) and (17) imply I - s = h - n. Then all equalities in (16) 
must hold, and we obtain 
i(y,2) = I, 
iCy, 1) = s, 
iCy, 1) + v(y, 1) = h. 
(18) 
Especially this implies that the first equality of (1.19) holds. We then obtain (11) by 2° 
of Theorem 1.3. By our earlier discussions, there are paths a E P r (2p), f3 E P r (2q), 
ljr E P r (2(n - p -q» such that y ~ a<>f3<>ljr, a(r) = h p , f3(r) = NJ (1, -1)0q, and 
ljr(r) = N[(-I, _l)0(n- p- q). Therefore by 2° of Theorem 1.3, there are integers 
k[, k2, k3 E Z such that 
i(a,l) = 2k\ - p, 
v(a, 1) = 2p, 
i(a,2) = 4k[ - p, 
(19) 
i(f3 , I) = 2k2, 
v(f3, 1) = q, 
i(f3, 2) = 4k2 , 
(20) 
i(ljr,l) = 2k3+(n-p-q), 
v(ljr,l) =0, 
(21) 
i(ljr,2) = 4k3 + (n - p - q). 
Thus by Theorem 6.2.7 and (18), we obtain (12)-(14) with k = k[ + k2 + k3. Since 
h ~ n + 1, from (12) and (13) we obtain k ~ 1. Then (15) follows from (12)-(14). 
3° The path y can be constructed using our study in Chapters 2, 5, and 6. The 
details are left to the readers. 
The proof is complete.

10 lteration inequalities 
A direct consequence of Theorem 3 is the following 
Corollary 4 Given y E P r (2n), suppose for some m, hEN and I, s E Z, (7) and 
(10) hold, and at least one of (11) to (15) does not hold. Then m = 1. 
Corollary 5 (G. Fei, S.-K. Kim, and T. Wang [FKWI]). Suppose for y E P,(2n) 
and some mEN and I E Z, 
I ~ iCy, m), 
iCy, 1) ~ I -
1, 
iCy, 1) + v(y, 1) ~ n + 1. 
(22) 
Then m = 1. 
Proof: Let s = I - 1 and h = n + 1. Then (7) and (10) follow from (22), and (15) 
does not hold. Thus m = 1 by Corollary 4. 
D 
Corollary 6 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLI]). Suppose for y E P,(2n) and some 
mEN, 
n + 1 ~ iCy, m), 
iCy, 1) ~ n, 
v(y) ~ 1. 
(23) 
Then m = 1. 
Proof: Letting I = n + 1 we get (22) from (23). Thus m = 1 by Corollary 5. 
D 
Next we consider the case of paths in Sp(2). Note that in this case the iteration 
number can be determined by i (y, m) and v(y, m) only. 
Theorem 7 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). Suppose for r > 0 and y E P~(2) 
there exists an mEN such that 
2 - v(y, m) ::: iCy, m) ::: 2. 
(24) 
Thenm = 1. 
Proof: Without loss of generality, we suppose r = 1. According to y (1) we continue 
our study in two cases. 
Case I y(l) E Sp(2)~. 
In this case, iCy, 1) must be even and v(y, m) = 1. From (24) and Theorem 8.1.4 
we obtain 
1 ::: iCy, m) = mil (y) ::: 2. 
Thus iCy, 1) ~ 2 and then m = 1. 

10.3 Controlling iteration numbers via indices 
227 
Case 2 y(1) E Sp(2)~ U {h}. 
In this case, i(y,l) must be odd and 1 < v(y, m) < 2. From (24) and 
Theorem 8.1.4 we obtain 
Os iCy, m) = m(i(y, 1) + 1) - 1 S 2. 
Therefore 
1 S m(i (y, 1) + 1) s 3. 
Thus iCy, 1) :::: 1 and then m = 1. 
D 
It is natural to ask whether Theorem 7 can be generalized to higher dimensional 
cases. Unfortunately, the answer is negative in general, because of the following 
example. 
Example 8 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). Fix any integers n :::: 2 and m :::: 2. We 
choose e E (0, 2n) such that me = 2n + xn for some X E (0,2). Let k = [nI2]. 
We define a path y E PI (2n) by 
where Fi(t) = R(2nt) and Qi(t) = R((e - 2n)t) for 1 SiS k. By results in 
Section 9.1, we obtain 
iCy, 1) = k(2 - 1) + k(1 - 2) = 0, 
v(y, 1) = 2k :::: 2, 
(26) 
iCy, m) = k(2m -
1) + k(2 + 1 - 2m) = 2k, 
v(y, m) = 2k. 
(27) 
Thus 
n + Pn - v(y, m) S iCy, m) S n + 1, 
(28) 
v(y, 1) :::: 2 [~J ' 
(29) 
where we define Pn = n if n is even, and Pn = n - 2 if n is odd. Therefore when 
n :::: 2, the condition (28)-(29) does not yield any bound on m in terms of n in general. 
Remark 9 The idea of controlling the iteration number by corresponding indices 
started from the study of D. Dong and the author in [Doll] of 1997 whose first 
preprint version appeared in 1993, where Corollary 6 was established via iteration 
theory developed in [Doll]. The current proof is due to [LLo3]. In the papers 

228 
IO 
Iteration inequalities 
[LLol] and [LL03] by C. Liu and the author, this idea was further developed to get 
more information on the iterations. All the other results in this section were proved 
in [LL03]. Special cases of Corollary 5 were proved by G. Fei, S.-K. Kim, and T. 
Wang in [FKW1] by using iteration inequalities of [DoLl]. Theorem 7 was proved 
in [DoLl] of 1997. Here we give a simpler proof. Example 8 was given in [DoLl]. 

Chapter 11 
The common index jump theorem 
Given a finite family of symplectic paths, the relationship among their iterated index 
sequences is very important in the study of periodic solutions of nonlinear Hamiltonian 
systems; such a relationship is specially crucial in distinguishing Harnitonian solution 
orbits geometrically. For every symplectic path, we define its index jumps by certain 
iterated index intervals. The common index jump theorem claims that for any finite 
family of symplectic paths in Sp(2n), their index jumps always contain infinitely 
many common non-empty intervals provided that their mean indices are positive and 
their initial indices are not less than n. This theorem turns out to be a powerful tool 
for applications to problems on nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. 
Results of this chapter were established by C. Zhu and the author in [LZu3] of 
1999. To the author's knowledge, no analogous results exist on common properties of 
indices of a finite family of symplectic paths before this work in any related areas, such 
as closed geodesics. Because of the precise iteration formulae derived in [LonI8] (cf. 
Chapter 8), it is possible to classify the problem into finitely many cases according 
to all possible different iteration patterns. The discovery of the common index jump 
theorem is based upon the classification given in [LonI8] for all possible eight itera-
tion patterns of indices of closed characteristics on convex compact hypersurfaces 
in R 4, and a further study on such a classification of all possible iteration patterns 
for paths in Sp(6). An illustration for this interesting common property is given in 
Example 15.3.7 below via weakly non-resonant ellipsoids. We refer the readers to 
Chapter 15 for further discussions. 
In Section 1, we derive a common selection theorem using certain properties of 
dynamics on tori. In Section 2, we prove the common index jump theorem and 
derive its consequences. This theorem plays a crucial role in our study in Chapter 15 
below. 
11.1 A common selection theorem 
We need the following common selection theorem. Recall the functions E(·), [.], 
({I(') , and {.} defined by (8.1.1). 
Theorem 1 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Fix an integer q > O. Let {Li :::: 0 and 
f3i be integers for all i = 1, ... ,k. Let Cii .} be positive numbers for j = 1, ... , {Li 
and i = 1, ... , q. Let 8 E (0, !) satisfying 
8 max {Li < -.

The common index jump theorem 
Set 
Suppose 
JLi 
Di=f3i+Lai,j' 
fori=I, ... ,q. 
j=! 
Di >0, 
Vi=l,oo.,q. 
Then there exist infinitely many (N, m!, ... , mq) E Nq+! such that 
JLi

E(miai,j) = N + tli, 
j=!

Vj=l,oo.,lLi,i=l,oo.,q, 
(5) 
miai,j EN, 
if ai,j E Q, 
(6) 
where 
tli= 
1 
(7) 
foralli = l,oo.,q. 
Proof: Firstly, we reduce the claims (4)-(6) to a dynamical problem on a torus. 
Then we prove the existence of numbers (N, m!, ... , mq) by the properties of the 
closed additive subgroups of some high dimensional torus. The proof is carried out 
in two steps. 
Step 1 The reduction to a problem on a torus 
We consider the left-hand side of (4) first. Using the function ¢(.) defined by 
(8.3.2), we obtain 
JLi 
mif3i + L 
E(miai,j) 
j=! 
JLi 
= miDi + L(cp(miai,j) - (miai,j}). 
j=! 
(8) 
To handle all the rational rotators, for 1 :s i :s q we require that each mi has a 
factor MEN such that Mai,j E N whenever ai,j E Q for j = 1, ... , lLi and 
i = 1, ... , q. Let M = I if no such ai,j exists. 
To get the common integer N E N, we replace mi Di in (8) by M'bi M Di. To make 
mi be an integer, we subtract the decimal part of J'vi from itself. Because of the 

11.1 A common selection theorem 
231 
requirement of our later torus problem and to keep more flexibility on our choice of 
N, we add a term Xi E {O, I} to it. This yields 
miDi = ~MDi - {~} MDi + XiMDi 
MDi 
MDi 
N + (Xi - { :Di }) M Di. 
(9) 
Here we define 
mi=([:VJ+Xi)M, Vi=l, ... ,q, 
(10) 
where Xi = 0 or 1 for 1 ::; i ::; q will be determined later. By this choice, (8) becomes 
lLi 
mif3i + L 
E(miai,j) 
j=l 
~ N + (x; - L~); )) M D; + ~ 
(.(m;a;,j) - (m;a;,j))' 
(11) 
Now the claims (5) and (6) require that only the following three possibilities for 
each term {miai,j} can happen: 
(A) {miai,j} = 0 if ai,j E Q, 
(B) 0 < {miai,j} < /) if ai,j E R \ Q, or 
(C) 1 - /) < {miai,j} < 1 ifai,j E R\Q. 
Note that (A) already holds by our choice of miS of (10). Suppose now that all 
these three requirements are fulfilled by our choice of miS. Then we have 
lLi 
L(cp(miai,j) - {miai,j}) 
j=l 
= L + L + L(cp(miai,j) - {miai,j})

The common index jump theorem 
Thus (11) becomes 
Therefore

(14) 
j=l 
Here to get (4), by (1) we need 
(15) 
Next we estimate {miCXi,j }. By our choice of mi in (10), we have 
{miCXi,j} = {M ([ :DJ + Xi) CXi,j } 
= {N~; ,j + (Xi - { :Oi }) MCXi,j } 
(16) 
where in (16), we set 
A- . N -

{ Ncx' .}

X"j' 
(17) 
and Xi ,j = 0 or 1 will be determined later. 
Assume now that we can choose N E N such that

11.1 A common selection theorem 
233 
for a given 01 satisfying 0 < 01 < 0 < 1/2. Then if the sum Ai,j(N) + Bi,j(N) 2: 0, 
we obtain 
If Ai,j (N) + Bi,j (N) < 0, we obtain 
{miai,j} = Ai,}(N) + Bi,}(N) - (-1). 
That is 
o < 1 - {miai,}} = -(Ai,) (N) + Bi,} (N» < 01 < o. 
Therefore to prove (4)-(6), by (15), (18), and (19), it suffices to prove that we can 
choose integers Xi and Xi,} to be 0 or 1 and choose infinitely many integers N E N 
such that all the quantities 
(20) 
can be made simultaneously as small as we want. 
Let n = q + "L;=1 JLi , and 
v = (M~I'"'' M~q' ~'11, a~'12, ... , a~:l, ~~1, ... , a~:q ) ERn. (21) 
Then the problem becomes for any given small E E (0, min{o, 1/3}) to find a vertex 
X of the cube [0, l]n and infinitely many integers N E N such that 
I{Nv} - xl < E. 
This is a problem of the dynamics on the standard torus Tn = (RI z)n . 
Step 2 Dynamics on a torus 
(22) 
To solve problem (22), it suffices to note that the closure G of the set G 
{{mv} 1m E Z} in Tn forms a closed additive subgroup of the torus Tn. Thus G 
is a product of a possibly lower dimensional torus and a cyclic group, and G contains 
the identity element of Tn. 
Define a dynamical system f : Tn ~ Tn by f (x) = X + n (v) for all x E Tn. 
We consider the a and (V-limit sets of f which are defined as usual by 
a(x) = n {jk(x) I k :s -N}, 
(V(x) = n {P(x) I k 2: N}, 
NEN 
NEN 
for any x E Tn. 

234 
11 
The common index jump theorem 
If v E Qn, G must be the finite cyclic group generated by Jr (v). So we have 
a(O) = w(O) = G = G. 
If vERn \ Qn, then we have #G = +00 and hence the limit sets a(O) and w(O) 
are non-empty. By the definition of the limit sets and the fact vERn \ Qn, we have 
a(O) + G c a(O), 
w(O) + G c w(O). 
Since the limit sets are closed, we have 
a(O) + G c a(O), 
w(O) + G C w(O). 
Thus by the facts that a(O) U w(O) c G and that G is a closed additive subgroup of 
Tn, we also obtain 
a(O) = w(O) = G. 
(23) 
Therefore there always exist infinitely many N E N such that the point {Nv} is 
located in the open ball in Tn centered at its identity element with radius f < 1/3. 
More precisely, we have proved that in the product space X = [0, l]n, there exist one 
vertex x of X and infinitely many N E N such that 
{Nv} E BE (x) n X, 
(24) 
where BE (x) = {y E R n Ily - xl < f}. Now we define X = x, and then (22) holds. 
The proof is complete. 
0 
In our later applications, we need to know more about the possible choices of the 
vector X in Theorem 1. The following result gives this information. 
Theorem 2 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Fix v = (VI, ... , vn ) ERn. Let H be 
the closure of the subset {{m v} I mEN} in Tn and V = TOJr -1 H be the tangent 
space of Jr -1 H at the origin in R n, where Jr : R n -+ Tn is the projection map. 
Define 
A(v) = V\UVkER\Q{X = (Xl, ... , xn ) E V I Xk = OJ. 
(25) 
Define 1/1 (X) = 0 when x ~ 0 and 1/1 (x) = 1 when x < O. Then for any a = 
(al, ... , an) E A(v), the vector 
(26) 
makes (22) holdfor infinitely many N E N. 
Moreover, this set A(v) possesses the following properties. 
(a) A(v) 1= 0. 
(b) When v E Qn, it holds that V = A(v) = {OJ. 

11.2 The common index jump theorem 
235 
(c) When v E Rn\Qn, it holds that dim V 2: 1,0 rf- A(v) c V , A(v) = -A(v), 
and that A(v) is open in V. 
(d) When dim V = 1, then A(v) = V\ {O}. 
(e) When dim V 2: 2, A (v) is obtained from V by deleting all the coordinate 
hyperplanes with dimension strictly smaller than dim V from V, and especially 
dim A(v) = dim V. 
Proof: If v E Qn, H is a cyclic subgroup of Tn. We then have V = {O}. Thus 
A(v) = V = {O}. 
Suppose v = (Vl, . . . ,Vn) E Rn\Qn. ThenH is a closed additive subgroup of 
Tn which is a product of a torus with a cyclic subgroup of Tn. By the definition of 
V, we have dim V 2: 1. For any a = (ai , .. . , an) E V, 
ai =I=- 0 
only if Vi E R\Q. 
When Vi E R \ Q, there exists a = (aI, . . . , an) E V with ai 
=I=- O. Thus for any 
a E A(v), the point X defined by (26) gives a vertex X of X = [0, l]n which is in 
the closure of {{mv} 1m E N} in X. Therefore (22) holds for infinitely many N E N 
and this X. 
The claims (a) to (e) follow from this argument, and their proofs are therefore 
omitted.

11.2 The common index jump theorem 
The following is the main result of this section. 
Theorem 1 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let Yk E PTk(2n)for k = 1, . .. , q be a 
finite collection of symplectic paths. Let Mk = Y (rd. We extend Yk to [0, +(0) by 
iteration via (8.0.4) for k = 1, ... , q. Suppose 
i(Yk, 1) > 0, 
Vk = 1, ... ,q.

Then there exist infinitely many (N , ml, ... , mq) E Nq+l such that

11.2 The common index jump theorem 
237 
By (13), the condition (1.3) of Theorem 1.1 holds. Applying this theorem to

Since the change of the nullity happens only when iterations of some eigenvalues in

Thus (2) and (3) hold. 
Step 3 Verifications of (4) and (5). 
By Theorem 9.3.1, (16), (2), and the definition of /(k, m), we have 
i(n, 2mk -

E ([m;O] + {m;O}) - E ([m;O] + {m;O} - 2:) (21) 
E ( { m;O }) - E ({ m;o } - :rr) . 
Note that ~_(mk. 0) takes only the value 0 or 1. To evaluate ~_(mk. 0) for any 
o E (0, 2rr) andeRe E a(Md withsomek E {I, ... , q}, we consider the following 
three cases: 
Case 1 {~} = o. 
By (21) and the definition of the function E(·), we have ~_(mk. 0) = O. 
Case 2 {m:e} E (0,8). 
Since 8 E (0,80), by the definition (8) of 80, we obtain 
{ mkO } _ ~ 
< 80 - ~ 
::: O. 
rr 
2rr 
2rr 
Thus we have ~-(mk. 0) = 1. 
Case 3 {"',;e} :::: 8 and SAl/eRe) > O. 
By (17) it must hold that 
1 - 8 < {m;o} < 1. 
Thus by the fact 8 E (0, 80) and the definition (8) of 80, we obtain 
{ mkO } _ ~ 
> 1 - 8 - ~

rr 
2rr

So in this case we have ~-(mk. 0) = O. 
Therefore only in the above Case 2, the term ~_ (mk. 0) makes a contribution. 
Together with (20) and (21), we obtain 
This proves (4).

Similarly to our above discussion, we have ~+(mk. 8) = 1 in the above Cases 1 and 3, 
and ~+(mk, 8) = 0 in the above Case 2. Thus from (22) we obtain 
i(Yk, 2mk + 1) = 2(N + .6.k) + (i(yk. 1) - 2Ck) + 2(Ck -

This proves (5).

The common index jump theorem 
The following consideration is useful for the study of closed characteristics in our 
applications. 
Theorem 2 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). 1n Theorem 1, further suppose 
(25) 
holdsfor some Pk E Sp(2n) and Gk E Sp(2n - 2) with 1 ::s k ::s q. Then (7) can be 
improved to

of Theorem 10.2.4 as well as (5), and obtain 
e(Alk)

This proves (26).

Next we introduce the index jump for any symplectic paths. 
Definition 3 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For any y E Pr(2n) and mEN, we 
define the moth index jump Om (y) of y by the open interval 
Om(y) = (i(y, m) + v(y, m) - 1, i(y, m + 2». 
(27) 
A direct consequence of Theorem 2 is the following 
Corollary 4 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let Yk E P rk (2n) for k = 1, ... , q be a 
finite collection of symplectic paths. We extend Yk to [0, +00) by iteration via (8.0.4) 
for k = 1, ... , q. Define

Chapter 12 
Index iteration theory 
for closed geodesics 
Morse index theory for closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds has a very long 
history, for details of which we refer the readers to the original book [Morl] of 
M. Morse, and the excellent survey works [Bot2] ofR. Bott and [Ban2] ofV. Bangert. 
Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with metric g. Denote the Levi-
Civita connection of (M, g) by V. A closed geodesic e on (M, g) is a map e : R/Z ~ 
M, which satisfies the following equation on M: 
"It E R. 
(1) 
Locally geodesics are shortest curves between any two given points in M. Let AM 
denote the Hilbert manifold of closed curves in (M, g) under the WI ,2(R/Z, M) 
norm. It is well known (cf. [Klil] and [Kli2]) that a closed geodesic is a critical point 
of the energy functional [; : A M ~ R: 
III 
[;(e) = -
g(e(t), e(t» dt, 
2 0 
"Ie E AM. 
(2) 
In the 1920s, M. Morse assigned to each closed geodesic e a pair of non-negative 
integers (ind(e), nul(e», which are now called Morse index and nullity of e, and 
discovered a significant relation between Morse index theory and the base manifold M. 
For a closed geodesic e, its q-th iterate eq is defined by eq(t) = e(qt) for q EN. 
Note that each eq is also a critical point of [; but possessing the same orbit set in 
M with e. In order to distinguish critical points of [; corresponding to different 
geodesic orbit sets in M, one way is to study the index sequence {(ind(eq ), nul(eq ))} 
of iterations {eq } of e. The goal of this chapter is to prove that the iteration theory 
established in previous chapters in Part IV for index theory of symplectic paths holds 
also for Morse index theory of closed geodesics. 
In the following Section 1, we briefly review the Morse index theory for closed 
geodesics. In Section 2, we study the splitting numbers of closed geodesics and 
prove that they coincide with the splitting numbers of symplectic matrices via 
Definition 9 .1.4. This then implies that our iteration theory also works for Morse 
index theory of closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. 
Most of the results in Section 1 are taking from [BotI] of R. Bott and [BTZI] of 
W. Ballmann, G. Thobergsson, and W. Ziller. Especially Theorem 1.1 was proved in 
[BotI] and [BTZI]. Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 were proved in [BTZI]. Theorems 2.1, 
2.2,2.3, and Corollary 2.4 were proved in the recent paper [LL04]. 

12.1 Morse index theory 
243 
12.1 Morse index theory 
We first recall some classical notations and definitions on geodesics. Let (M, g) be 
an n-dimensional complete connected Coo Riemannian manifold. Let e : R -+ M 
be a closed geodesic satisfying e(t + 1) = e(t) for all t E R and let p = e(O) = e(1). 
A Jacobi field U along e is a vector field U transversal to e and satisfies 
'\lc(t) 'lc(t)U(t) + Ri:(t)u(t)e(t) = O. 
Let E be the orthogonal complement of v = e(O) = e(I) in TpM. Then the lin-
earized Poincare map of e is defined by P : E EB E -+ E EB E with P : (X, Y) f-+ 
(U(l), '\lU(1», where U is the unique Jacobi field along e determined by U(O) = X 
and '\lU(O) = Y. The map P preserves the symplectic structure cp on E EB E defined 
by 
cp((XI, Yl), (X2, Y2» = (Xl, Y2) -
(YI, X2), 
where (., .) denotes the usual inner product in E ~ R n- 1 • 
Note that we can choose an orthonormal basis such that E ~ R n- 1 and E EB E ~ 
R 2(n-l). With this equivalence, the linearized Poincare map P corresponds to a 
symplectic matrix which is still denoted by P, and the above symplectic structure can 
be given on R 2(n-l) by 
cp(X, Y) = -(X J, Y) 
for any X, Y E R2n-2. Here J is the standard symplectic matrix introduced in 
Section 1.1. 
Let A = A(M) be the space of piecewise Coo curves e : I = [0, 1] -+ M such 
that e(O) = eel), which is equipped with the compact-open topology induced by 
the distance pee, e') = maxtEI d(e(t), e'(t». Here the distance d(p, q) for any two 
points p and q on M is defined by the infimum of the length of any curve on M 
connecting p and q induced by the Riemannian metric. The critical points of the 
energy functional £ : A -+ R defined by (0.2) are the closed geodesics and the point 
curves. 
For any closed geodesic cEil., let VA (c) be the space of piecewise Coo vector 
fields X along e such that (X, e(t») = 0 for all t and such that X(O) = XCI). The 
index form H : VA(e) x VA(e) -+ R of e is given by 
H(X, Y) = fo1 (('\lX, '\lY) -
(R(X, e)C, Y) dt, 
(1) 
where (., .) is the inner product induced by the Riemannian metric of the manifold 
M. Note that we have abused the symbol (., .) in two different senses. We hope that it 
will not cause any confusion. The Morse index ind(e) of e is defined to be the index 
of H, i.e., the total multiplicity of negative eigenvalues of H. The nnllity nul (c) of 
c is defined by 
nul(e) = dime kerc(HIVA(c). 
(2) 

244 
12 
Index iteration theory for closed geodesics 
Similarly the index indn(c) of a geodesic segment c : [0, 1] --+ M is defined to be 
the index of the form H on the space V n (c) of piecewise Coo vector fields X along 
c such that (X, c(t)} = 0 for all t and that X(O) = XCI) = O. The nullity of cis 
defined by 
nuln(c) = dime kerc(H!Vn(c)). 
(3) 
It is well known that nul (c) = dime kerc(P -
id) and ind(c) ::: indn(c). For 
t > 0, let /L(t) be the number of linearly independent Jacobi fields Y along c with 
YeO) = yet) = O. Then the Morse index theorem (cf. [Morl]) for geodesic segments 
states that 
indn(c) = L /L(t), nulQ(c) = /L(l). 
O<t<1 
The concavity C (c) of the closed geodesic c is defined by 
C(c) = ind(c) - indn(c). 
(4) 
Then 0 :s C(c) :s n -
1. 
Let c : R/Z --+ M be a closed geodesic. Two points c(s) and c(t) are conjugate 
if there is a non-zero Jacobi field U along c such that U(s) = U(t) = O. Choose 
points 0 = to < tl < ... < tk = 1 such that there are no pairs of conjugate points on 
Cl[ti,ti+tl. Denote by J the vector space of continuous vector fields X along c such 
that XI[ti+k,ti+l +kJ is a Jacobi field orthogonal to c for alIi and all k E Z. Denote the 
complexification of J by Je. For q E Nand wED, set 
Jw = {X E Je I X(t + 1) = wX(t) "It E R}. 
Jw is a finite dimensional subspace of Je. A symmetric form Hw is defined on Jw 
by 
Hw(X, y) = fo\(''VX, 'VY} - (R(X, c)c, Y})dt, 
where we have extended (., .) to a Hermitian form and R to a complex linear tensor 
of T M ® C. We define 
I(w) = indHw , 
N(w) = dime kere Hw , 
and lo(w) = I(w) + N(w). Note that 1(1) = ind(c), N(I) = nul (c) and 10(1) = 
indo(c) = ind(c) + nul(c). Denote the complexification of E by Ec :;:::: C n- 1 and 
extend the linear Poincare map P to a complex linear automorphism of Ec EEl Ec :;:::: 
cn-l EEl C n- 1. Here the matrix P acts from the right on row vectors. 
We define the q fold iteration of the closed geodesic c by cq(t) = c(qt) for all 
t E R. The splitting numbers of the closed geodesic c at wED are defined by 
S~(w) = lim l(weR(J) -/(w).

Proof: (i) Let A be a symmetric fonn on a finite dimensional real vector space V 
(or a Hermitian fonn on a complex vector space). For any subspace W C V, 
indA = indAlw + indAI w.L + dim(W n W.l) - dim(W n ker A), 
(9) 
dim ker A = dim ker Alw.L - dim(W n W.l) + dim(W n ker A). 
(10) 
From (9) and (10) we obtain (i). (ii) follows from the definitions of Cp, splitting 
numbers, and (i). (iii) follows from the second equation of (7).

The space V = Ec EEl Ec ~ en-I EEl en-I is a symplectic space with the standard 
symplectic fonn (fJ. L = (0, Ed ~ (0, en-I) is a Lagrangian subspace of V. 
Considering another Lagrangian subspace L' of V with 
L n L' = 0, 
PL n L' = 0, 
(11) 
for Z E U, define the following fonn on V: 
Bw(X, Y) -
Bw(P, L, L')(X, Y) 
= ~(fJh((PW - I)X, Y) 
(12) 
+~(fJh((PW - I)X, Jr(Pw - I)Y), 
where Jr is the projection of V onto L such that ker Jr = L'. 
Theorem 3 (W. BaUmann, G. Thobergsson, and W. Ziller [BTZl]). 
(i) ker Bw = ker(P - wI). 
(ii) S~(w) = limo---+±oindBweR& - indBw. 
(iii) indBw(P, L, L')-indBw(P, L, L~)isindependentofwif(L, L')and(L, L~) 
satisfy (11). 
Proof: (i) By definition, we have ker(P - wI) C ker Bw. To prove 
note that 
ker Bw C ker(P - wI), 
Bw(X, Y) = ~(fJh(Jr(PW -I)X, Y) 
+~(fJh(Jr'(PW -I)X, PwY), 
(13) 
(14) 
where Jr is the projection of V onto L such that ker Jr = L', and Jr' is the projection 
of V onto L' such that ker Jr' = L. Let X E ker Bw. For every Y E L, 
(15) 
Thus Jr'(Pw -I)X E P L. By (11) this implies Jr'(Pw -I)X = O. Therefore we 
obtain 
Bw(X, Y) = ~(fJh(Jr(PW - I)X, Y) = 0,

for all Y E V. This then implies n(Pw - I)X = O. Thus (PW - I)X = 0 and (13) 
holds. 
(ii) By (14), for X, Y E L we get 
Thus (ii) holds. 
(iii) By (9) we get 
indB", = indB", IL + indB",IL1- + dim(L n L.l) - dim(L n ker B",), 
where L.l is the orthogonal complement of L with respect to B",. By (i) we get 
ker B", = ker(P - wI) n V. Thus it is only left to prove L.l = (P - wI)-l L n V. 
By (14), X E L.l if and only if (15) holds for all Y E L. By P L n L' = 0, (15) is 
equivalent to n'(Pw - I)X = O. And the latter is equivalent to (Pw - I)X E L. 
Therefore (iii) holds.

12.2 Splitting numbers 
Let c : R/Z -+ M be a closed geodesic on an n-dimensional Riemannian mani-
fold (M, g). Denote its Poincare map by P as in Section 1. By Theorem 1.2, the 
splitting numbers S p (w) of the closed geodesic c at w defined by (1.5) depend only 
on P E Sp(2n - 2) and w E U. In this section, we prove that the splitting num-
bers of c coincide with the splitting numbers of its Poincare map P viewed as a 
symplectic matrix P E Sp(2n - 2) given by Definition 9 .1.4. We first establish the 
homotopy invariance (on the homotopy component of P via Definition 1.8.5) and 
symplectic additivity for splitting numbers of closed geodesics. Then we compute 
them explicitly when P corresponds to basic normal forms of symplectic matri-
ces. These computation results coincide with the splitting numbers stew) given by 
Theorem 9.1.7. Therefore the index iteration theory we have established in the pre-
vious chapters works also for closed geodesics. 
Theorem 1 (C. Lin and Y. Long [LLo4]). For P E Sp(2n - 2), M E nO(p), and 
WEU, 
stew) = S~(w), 
(1) 
and 
(2) 
Proof: (1) follows from the fact I (w) = I (w) and the properties of eigenvalues of 
symplectic matrices.

Index iteration theory for closed geodesics 
To prove (2) we fix an M E QO(P). Pick up a smooth path f : [0, 1] -* QO(P) 
such that f(O) = P and f(l) = M. For any wE U and t E [0, 1], 
dime kerc(P - wI) = dime kere(f(t) - wI) = dime kerc(M - wI). 
(3) 
Set L = (0, Ee). It is a Lagrangian subspace of V = Ee EEl Ee. For any to E [0,1], 
by the continuity of f, there exist E(to) > ° 
and a subspace Lto of V such that 
L n Lto = 0, 
f(t)L n Lto = 0, 
Vt E (to - E(to), to + E(tO»· 
By the compactness of [0, 1], there exist k - 1 numbers 0= to < tl < ... < tk = 1 
and k Lagrangian subspaces L; for i = 1, 2, ... , k such that 
Vt E [ti-I, til, i = 1,···, k. 
(4) 
Thus similarly to (1.11), by (1.12) and (4) we can define the form Bw(f(t), L, L;) 
for t E [ti-I, til and i = 1, ... , k. By (i) of Theorem 1.3, 
dime kere Bw(f(t), L, L;) = dime kere(f(t) - wI) = dime kercCP - wI), 
which does not depend on t E [ti-l, til. Thus indBw(f(t), L, L;) is constant for all 
t E [ti-I, td, and 
By (iii) of Theorem 1.3, we have that 
is constant in the variable wE U. Thus for each i = 0, 1, ... ,k - 1, the function 
is constant. This implies that 
does not depend on WE U . By (ii) of Theorem 1.3, 
S~(w) = lim indB Ro(P,L,L~)-indBw(p,L,L~) 
o ..... ±o 
we

Theorem 2 (c. Lin and Y. Long [LLo4]). For P E Sp(2n - 2) and Pi E Sp(2ni)

PIOP2 - wI = (PI - wI)0(P2 - wI), 
'Vw E U. 
By the definition (1.6), we have 
(P - wI)-I(O, Ec) = (PI - wI)-I(O, Ej)0(P2 - wI)-I(O, E2). 
Denote by Ii the standard symplectic matrix on R 2nj for i = 1 and 2. Then I =

(XI(PIW - I)1], YI) + (X2(P2W - I)h Y2) 
= HP1,W(XI, Yl) + Hhw(X2, Y2). 
dime kerc(P]oP2 - wI) = dime kerc(PI - wI) + dime kerc( P2 - wI). 
By the definition of C P (w), 
Cp(w) = (ind + dime kerc) Hp,w - dime kerc(P - wI) 
= (ind + dime kerc)HPJ,w - dime kere(PI - wI) 
+(ind + dime kerc)Hhw - dime kerc(P2 - wI) 
= CPl (w) + CP2(W). 
Thus by Theorem 1.2,

Index iteration theory for closed geodesics 
For splitting numbers of geodesics with basic normal forms defined in Section 1.8, 
we have the following result. 
Theorem 3 (C. Lin and Y. Long [LL04]). (i) If P = Nl (1, b) with b = 0 or 1, 
then S~(l) = 1. 
(ii) If P = N) (1, -1), then S~(l) = O. 
(iii) If P = Nl(-l, b) with b = Oor -1, thenS~(-l) = 1. 
(iv) IfP = N)(-I, 1), thenS~(-I) =0. 
(v) If P = R(e) with e E (O,:rr) U (:rr, 2:rr), then St(eRe ) = 0 and Sp(eRe ) 
=1. 
(vi) If P = N2(W , b) with w = eRe and e E (O,:rr) U (:rr, 2:rr) is non-trivial, i.e., 
(b2 - b3) sine < 0, then S~(eRe) = 1. 
(vii) If P = N2(W, b) with w = eRe and e E (O,:rr) U (:rr, 2:rr) is trivial, i.e., 
(b2 - b3) sine> 0, then S~(eRe) = o. 
Proof: (vi) Note that in this case, we must have n = dim M = 3 and Ec = C 2. 
For z = eR'I' with cp =1= e and cp being very close to e, the matrix (R(e) - zl) is 
invertible. If (X), Yl, X2, Y2)(P - zl) = (0,0, *, *) E (0, C 2), then Xl = Yl = O. 
This implies that (P - zl)-)(O, Ec) = (0, Ec). For any X = (0,0, Yl, Y2) and 
Y = (0,0, U), U2) E (P - zl)-l(O, Ec), 
Hp,z(X, y) = (X(pz -I)J, Y) 
= z(O, 0, *, *)J, (0,0, Ul, U2)) 
= z(*, *,0,0), (0,0, Ul, U2)) 
= o. 
Here and below * denotes all complex numbers that we do not care about. Thus 
(ind + dime kerc)Hp,z = 2 and dime kerc(P - zl) = o. It implies Cp(z) = 2. 
Note that 
In fact, 
(Xl, X2, y), Y2)(P - wI) = (0,0, *, *) E (0, C 2), 
if and only if (Xl, x2)(R(e) - wI) = O. The latter implies X2 = HXl. 
For X = 
(Xl, HXl, Yl, Y2) and Y 
= 
(X2, HX2, Ul , U2), by direct

Since P is non-trivial, i.e., (b2 - b3) sine < 0, it holds that dime kere Hp.w = 2,

S~(w) = 2 - 1 = 1. This proves (vi). 
(vii) By (6) similarly to the last paragraph in the above proof of (vi), since P is

Thus by definition, Cp(z) = 1 for z 1= 1, and Cp(I) = O. Thus S~(l) = I follows 
from Theorem 1.2. 
When P = Nl (1 , 1), the proof is similar to the above case, and is thus omitted. 
The proofs of (ii)-(iv) are similar to that of (i), and are also omitted.

Now by the above Theorems 1 to 3 and discussions in Section 9.1, we obtain 
Corollary 4 For any P E Sp(2n - 2) and W E U, 
S~(w) = S~(w), 
(7) 
where the left-hand side of (7) is defined by (1.5) and the right-hand side of (7) is 
defined by (9.1.4). 
Remark 5 As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, Corollary 4 implies that 
our index iteration theory established in the previous chapters also holds for Morse 
index theory of closed geodesics on any n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g). 
Here we should point out a major difference of index iteration formulae between the 
Morse index theory of closed geodesics and the index theory for closed characteristics 
on convex compact hypersurfaces in R2n studied in our Chapter 15 below. Note that 
the linearized Poincare map P of a closed geodesic c on (M, g) is a (2n - 2) x (2n - 2) 

12.2 Splitting numbers

symplectic matrix. By (Ll), the Morse index theory (ind(c), nul(c)) is the index 
of the form H defined on vector fields which are orthogonal to the tangent vector 
field c(t) along c. Therefore comparing our study in Chapter 15, the term NJ (1,1) 
appearing in Lemma 15.2.4 for the end point Yx (r) of the associated symplectic path 
for closed characteristic (r, x) has no corresponding part in the Poincare map P for 
closed geodesic c. Correspondingly, all the results in our Chapters 8 to 11, without 
using the condition (10.2.21) 
hold also for Morse index theory of closed geodesics, provided we replace n by n - 1. 
We also point out that our index iteration theory also works for closed geodesics 
on Finsler manifolds.

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
For the nonlinear autonomous Hamiltonian system 
x = J H'(x), 
(1) 
in his pioneering work [Rab2] of 1978, P. Rabinowitz proved the following famous 
result via the variational method. 
Theorem 1 (P. Rabinowitz [Rab2]). Suppose H satisfies the conditions: 
(RI) HE c1(R2n, R). 
(R2) There exist constants {L > 2 and ro > 0 such that 
0< {LH(x) :::: H'(x) . x, 
(R3) H(x) = o(lxI2) at x = O. 
(R4) H(x) 2: Of or all x E R2n. 
Vlxl 2: roo 
Then for any T > 0, the system (1) possesses a non-constant T-periodic 
solution. 
Because a T / k-periodic function is also a T -periodic function, in [Rab2] 
Rabinowitz proposed a conjecture that "We suspect however that under the hypo-
theses of Theorem 2.1 (i.e., the above Theorem 1) there is a non-constant solution 
having any prescribed minimal period". Since 1978, there have appeared many con-
tributions to this conjecture. F. Clarke and I. Ekeland in their paper [ClEI] of 1980 
made the first breakthrough, where they solved the case for subquadratic Hamilto-
nian systems. Then a great number of contributions to this minimal period prob-
lem followed from many mathematicians (cf. [AmMI], [AmCl], [ClEl,2], [DenI], 
[Eke3], [GiMI,2,3,4], [Hofl], etc.). Among them, significant progress was made by 
I. Ekeland and H. Hofer in their celebrated paper [EkHI] of 1985, where they proved 
Rabinowitz's conjecture for strictly convex Hamiltonian systems. In [DoLl] of 1997 
by D. Dong and the author, Corollary 10.3.6 was proved, which discovered the intrin-
sic relationship between the minimal period and the indices of a solution. This result 
in fact unified all the results obtained before under various convexity conditions. Note 
also that in [Lon8], [Lon9], and [Lon12], the first result on this conjecture for second 
order Hamiltonian systems under precisely Rabinowitz's original structure conditions 
was obtained. 
Among all these results, four kinds of methods are used to determine the minimality 
of the period of a solution. 
lOA priori estimate method. This method estimates the difference of critical values 
between minimal period solutions and non-minimal ones. Because the critical values 
increase according to iterations in many cases, when the critical value of a particular 

258 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
solution is small enough, it must have minimal period. Usually this method requires 
the Hamiltonian function to be close to monomials (cf. [AmM1], [C1E1,2], [Den1], 
[Eke3], [GiM1,2], [Lon 10]). 
2° Convexity method. This method uses the dual action principle of convex Hamil-
tonian systems, a Bott-type iteration formula and the iteration inequality of Ekeland 
index theory, and Hofer's topological characterization of mountain-pass points. This 
method was introduced by Ekeland and Hofer in their celebrated paper [EkH1] of 
1985, where a special case of Corollary 4.3 was proved. This method was applied by 
many other authors to various convex Hamiltonian systems before 1993 (cf. [AmC 1], 
[Eke3], [GiM3-4]). 
3° Iteration inequalities of symmetric Morse indices. This method depends on 
the iteration inequalities of symmetric Morse indices for second order Hamiltonian 
systems. It has no need of any further requirement on the potential function. This 
method was introduced in [Lon8] in 1993 and [Lon9] in 1994, and has been used to 
give a natural lower bound for the minimal period of solutions found by variational 
methods (cf. [Lon8], [Lon9], and [Lon12]). 
4° Iteration theory method of the index function theory. This method was first 
introduced by D. Dong and the author in [DoLl] of 1997, which had already appeared 
in 1993 as a Nankai Institute preprint. It has been further developed by C. Liu and the 
author in [LLo1] and [LL03]. In fact, the main reason for our interest or developing 
the iteration theory of the index for symplectic paths is to find such a new way to 
study Rabinowitz's conjecture. Based upon the work [DoLl], G. Fei, Q. Qiu, T. Wang 
and others have applied this method to various problems of Rabinowitz's conjecture 
(cf. [FeQ1], [FKW1]). 
In this chapter, the last two methods above are introduced. We use our iteration 
theory of the index for symplectic paths established in Chapters 8 to 10 to reveal the 
intrinsic connections between the minimal period and the index of periodic solutions. 
Especially, Theorem A in the Introduction of this book is proved in Section 2 below. In 
Section 3 and 4, we study this conjecture for asymptotically linear and superquadratic 
Hamiltonian systems. We also include some results on the same conjecture for second 
order Hamiltonian systems in Section 5 under precisely Rabinowitz's original struc-
ture conditions, as well as some results on subharmonics of Hamiltonian systems in 
Section 6. In Section 1, we briefly review some basic results on the minimax principle 
which are used in this chapter. 
13.1 Minimax principle preparations 
The minimax principle is a very powerful tool in finding solutions of nonlinear prob-
lems. In this section, we introduce some concepts and minimax theorems which 
form a part of the basis for our study in Chapters 12 and 13 of this book. Because 
these results are well known and can be found in many books, we shall only list the 
theorems, indicate necessary modifications, for our applications, and refer readers 
for the details of proofs to the celebrated books [Rab7] of P. Rabinowitz for minimax 

13.1 Minimax principle preparations 
259 
principles, and [Cha6] of K.c. Chang and [Gh02] of N. Ghossoub for information on 
the Morse indices of critical points found by minimax arguments. In Section 14.3, 
we shall give another minimax theorem for our study in Chapter 14. 
In the rest of this section, all the homologies are singular homology, we fix the 
coefficient field of all homological groups to be R, and the working space X to be a 
real Banach space. 
As in Section 7 of [Rab7], Section 11.4 of [Cha6], and Section 7.1 of [Gh02], we let 
G be a compact Lie group acting on X via one of its representations which we denote 
by g * x E X for x E X and g E G. A subset A of X is G-invariant if G * A = A. 
A function f : X ---+ R is G-invariant on X if 
f(g * x) = f(x), 
Vx E X, g E G. 
Let Y be another separable Banach space with a G-action represented by g * Y E Y 
for any y E Y and g E G. A map cp : X ---+ Y is G-equivariant on X if 
cp(g *x) = g *cp(x), 
Vx EX, g E G. 
We denote by Cc(X, Y) the set of all continuous and G-equivariant maps from X to 
Y. In the rest of this book, we shall be interested in the cases of G = {id}, Z2, and 
SI. For any fECI (X, R), we denote fc = {x E X I f(x) ::: c}, KAf) = {x E 
X I f'ex) = 0, f(x) = c} for any c E R, and K(f) = {x E X I f'ex) = OJ. 
Definition 1 (cf. pp. 83-85 of [Cha6]). Let D be a k-dimensional ball in X, and S 
be a subset of X satisfying aD n S = 0. We say that a D and S homotopically link, 
if cp(D) n S 1= 0 for any cp E C(D, X) satisfying cplaD = idlaD. We say that aD 
and S homologically link, if Irl n S 1= 0 for any singular k-chain r with ar = aD 
where I r I is the support of r. 
Definition 2 (cf. pp. 166-167 of [Gho2]). A family F of G-invariant subsets of X 
is said to be G-homotopic of dimension n with boundary B if there exists a compact 
G-invariant subset D of R n containing a closed subset Do and a G-equivariant sur-
jective a E C(Do, B) such that 
F = {A C X I A = feD) for some f E Cc(D, X) with f = a on Do}. 
(1) 
A family F(ex) of subsets of X is said to be a homological family of dimension n 
with boundary B if for some non-trivial class ex in Hn(X, B), the family F(ex) is 
defined by 
F(ex) = {A C X I A is compact, B C A, ex E Im(i~)}, 
(2) 
where i~ is the homomorphism from Hn(A, B) ---+ Hn(X, B) induced by the 
immersion i : A ---+ X. 
Definition 3 (cf. [Rab7]). As usual, suppose fECi (X , R). f satisfies the Palais-
Smale condition for c E R ((PS)c for short), if every (PS)c sequence {Xk} C X, i.e., 
it satisfies the condition that 
(3) 

260 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
possesses a convergent subsequence in X. f satisfies the (PS) condition, if it satisfies 
the (PS)c condition for any c E R. 
Definition 4 (cf. p. 32 of [Cha6]). For x E KAf) the q-th critical group Cq(j, x) 
of f at x is defined by 
(4) 
where Ux is any small open neighborhood of x in X such that Kc(j) n Ux = {x}. 
Next we give some powerful minimax theorems which will be used later. 
Theorem 5 (cf. Theorem 10.4, Corollaries 10.5 and 10.16 of [Gho2]). As in 
Definition 2, let F(Ci) be a homological family of dimension q with boundary D. 
Suppose that f E C2(X, R) satisfies the (PS) condition. Define 
Suppose that 
c == c(j, F(Ci» = 
inf sup f(x) .

and f"(x) is Fredholmfor x E Kc(j). Then there exists an x E Kc(j) such that the 
Morse index m-(x) and the nullity mO(x) of the functional f at x, which are defined 
to be the dimensions of the largest subspaces of X on which f" (XO) are negative 
definite or null respectively, satisfy 
(7) 
Moreover, iff is Sl-invariant under an Sl-action on X, and the set Sl * x is not a 
single point, (7) can be improved to 
(8) 
Remark 6 This theorem is a slight modification of Theorem 10.4, Corollaries 10.5 and 
10.16 of [Gh02]. The -1 in the right-hand side of (8) comes from the Sl-invariance 
of f. In this case, this critical orbit makes at least one non-trivial element of the null 
space not to tum into a negative definite element in the proofs of [Gh02]. 
Next we describe the saddle point theorem. 
Theorem 7 (cf. [Rab7], [Nil], [Cha2], and [Gho2]). Let X be a real Hilbert 
space with orthogonal decomposition X = Z EB Y, where dim Z < 00. Suppose 
f E C2(X, R) satisfies the (PS) condition, and the following conditions: 
(Fl) There exist p and Ci > 0 such that 
f(x) ::: Ci

3° Suppose that there is an Sl action on X, f is Sl-invariant, andfor Xo

improved to 
Sketch of the Proof: lOis the well-known Theorem 5.3 of [Rab7]. Next we sketch 
the proof of 2° and 3° based on Theorem 5. Since Q is a strong deformation retract 
of the whole space X, it holds that Hq(Q, aQ) ~ Hq(Z, aQ), where aQ is the 
boundary of Q in Z EEl (Re). We have 
Hq(Q, aQ) ~ Hq_l(Sq-l) ~ R. 
Denote by i : Q -+ Z the inclusion map. Let a = [Q] E Hq (Q, a Q) be a generator. 
Then i*a is non-trivial in Hq(Z, aQ), and F(i*a) defined by (2) is a homological 
family of dimension dim Z + 1 with boundary a Q and Q E F(i*ak). Define 
c =

sup f(x).

Note that by a topological degree argument as in Proposition 5.9 of [Rab7], under 
the conditions (FI) and (F2) for R > p, the sets aQ and aBp(O) n Y homotopic ally 
link in X. Thus by (FI) and (F2), we obtain 
sup f(x) < a :s c :s max f(x). 
XEaQ 
XEQ

Since f satisfies the (PS) condition, and f' is Fredholm, by Theorem 5 we obtain 2° 
and 3°. 
Remark 8 On the minimax principle, we also refer to [Nil] of W.-M. Ni. As far 
as the author knows, the study on the topological information as well as the Morse 
index of critical points found by minimax arguments started from the works [Hofl] 
of H. Hofer and [Tial] of G. Tian independently, as well as [LaSI] of A. Lazer and 
S. Solimini and [SolI] of S. Solimini in the 1980s. We also refer readers to [Cha6], 
[GhoI], [BaLl], [Tanl], and [Wzq2] for further related results.

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
13.2 Controlling the minimal period via indices 
For given r > 0, let S, = R \ (r Z). In order to study the minimal period, say rim 
for some mEN, of a non-constant r-periodic solution x of a nonlinear autonomous 
Hamiltonian system (0.1), we depend on the iteration theory of the index established 
in previous chapters. Using the index given by Definitions 5.4.3 and 8.0.1, in the 
following, we denote 
(i(x, 11m), v(x, 11m)) = (it(xl[O,,/ml), Vt(xl[O,,/ml))' 
(1) 
Theorem I For r > 0, let Xo E C2(S" R2n) be a r-periodic solution of the system 
(0.1) with minimal period rim for some mEN. Suppose H satisfies the condition 
(HXO) His C2 along the orbit O(x) = {x(t) It E R}. 
If there exists some k E Z such that the indices of Xo satisfy the following conditions: 
(Xl) i(xo, 1) :s k + 1. 
(X2) i(xo, 11m) ~ k. 
(X3) i(xo, 11m) + v(xo, 11m) ~ n + 1. 
Then m = 1, i.e., the solution Xo possesses minimal period r. 
Proof: This is a direct consequence of Corollary 10.3.5 with I = k + 1. 
0 
Corollary 2 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). Let Xo E C2(S" R2n) be a r-periodic 
solution of the system (0.1) with minimal period rim for some mEN satisfying 
(HXO). Let the indices of Xo satisfy the following conditions: 
(X4) i (xo, 1) :s n + 1. 
(X5) i(xo, 11m) ~ n. 
Then m = 1, i.e., the solution Xo possesses minimal period r. 
Proof: Since Xo is a non-constant r -periodic solution of the autonomous system (0.1), 
the function xo is a non-trivial r -periodic solution of the corresponding linearized 
system 
y = J H"(xo(t))y. 
(2) 
Thus v(xo, 11m) ~ 1. Now we can apply Theorem 1 with k = n to conclude m = 1. o 
Proposition 3 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). Fort> 0, let Xo E C2(S" R2n) be 
a non-constant r-periodic solution of the system (0.1) which satisfies (HXO) and the 
following conditions: 
(HX1) H" (xo(t)) ~ 0, i.e., H" (xo(t)) possesses only non-negative eigenvalues 
for every t E R 
(HX2) f; H" (xo(t))dt is positive definite. 

13.2 Controlling the minimal period via indices 
263 
Then 
i(xo, 1) ::: n. 
(3) 
If xo further satisfies (X4), it then possesses minimal period T. 
Proof: For the saddle point reduction described in Section 4.3 with respect to the 
Hamiltonian function K = 4H"(xo(t))x. x, the space L = L2(Sr, R2n) possesses 
an orthogonal decomposition 
(4) 
where L ± = p± Land Z = P L are defined by (4.3.4) via the projections 
p± and P defined by (4.3.2). Let g be the functional defined by (4.2.4) with H 
replaced by K, and a : Z -+ R be the functional defined by Theorem 4.3.1. Then by 
Theorem 4.5.1, we obtain 
1 
a(z) :::: 2:(A(P-w(z) + z), P-w(z) + z) - g(P-w(z) + z), 
Vz E Z, 
(5) 
where P - and w(z) are given by (4.3.2) and (4.3.22) respectively. Note that Z 
possesses a decomposition according to the positive, null, and negative definiteness 
of A = -Jdldt: 
Z=Z+EBZoEBZ-, 
ZO=R2n. 
By (5), we obtain that for any z = z- + Zo E (Z- EB Zo) \ {a}, 
1 
a(z) :::: -2: 11 P-w(z) + z_1I2 - g(P-w(z) + z- + zo) 
1 
:::: -2:(IIP- w(z)1I 2 + Ilz_112) - g(P-w(z) + z- + zo), 
where the orthogonality between P-w(z) and z- has been used. 
(6) 
(7) 
ThusifllP-w(z)11 2+lIz_11 2 > O,by(HXl)wehavea(z) < 0. On the other hand 
if IIP - w(z)1I 2 + IIz_112 = 0, (7) becomes 
1 ({T 
/I 
) 
a(z) :::: -2: 10 H (xo(t))dt zo' zo < 0. 
Here in the last step we have used (HX2). Thus the negative Morse index m - of the 
functional a at z = ° 
satisfies 
m- ::: dim Z- + dim ZO = (d - n) + 2n = d + n, 
(8) 
where 2d = dim Z. Combining this with Theorem 6.1.1, we obtain (3). 
Denote the minimal period of xo by Tim for some mEN. Then (3) with T replaced 
by the period Tim implies (X5). Now by (X4) we can apply Corollary 2 to conclude 
m = 1, and complete the proof.

13 The Rabinowitz conjecture 
Remark 4 Corollary 2 and Proposition 3 were proved by D. Dong and the author 
in [DoLl]. Note that Corollary 2 actually contains all the known results on the 
Rabinowitz conjecture under various convexity conditions. Theorem 1 is a slight 
generalization of Corollary 2. 
13.3 Asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems 
In this section we apply results obtained earlier to any autonomous asymptotically 
linear Hamiltonian system (0.1) defined on R 2n. The main result in this section is 
the following theorem. 
Theorem I (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). Let r > O. Suppose the Hamiltonian 
function H satisfies the conditions (R3), (R4), and 
(HCI) H E C2(R2n , R). 
(HBO) There exists a positive definite matrix B E Cs (R2n) such that 
H'(x) = Bx + o(lxl) 
as 
Ixl ~ 00. 
(HBI) v(BI[o.T)' 1) = O. 
(HB2) i(BI[o,T)' 1) > n. 
Then there exists a r-periodic non-constant solution Xo of(O.I) such that 
n + 2 - v(xo, 1) ::s i(xo, 1) ::s n + 1. 
(1) 
(2) 
Moreover, suppose the conditions (HXI) and (HX2) hold for this xo. Then the 
minimal period of Xo is r. 
Proof: We carry out the proof in several steps. 
Step I Truncated Hamiltonian functions. 
In order to use the saddle point reduction method, we need to truncate the function 
H suitably to get the boundedness of II HI/lie. 
We note that the condition (HBO) implies the fact 
(3) 
and the existence of constants Ao 2: ;"0 > 0 such that 
Aol 2: B 2: Aol. 
(4) 
Thus there exists a constant ko 2: 5 such that 
(5)

for k + b(k) :S r, 
for k < r < k+b(k). 
(6) 
In fact, we first define Xk = 1 for r E [0, kJ. Then by induction on integers m 2: 0, 
we can assume that Xk has been extended smoothly to [0, k + m J such that 
1 
° :S Xk(k + m) :S max{O, 1 - Lr=l k~i} == M(k, m),

for k + m - 1 < r :S k + m. 
Since Li::::l k~i = +00, there exists an integer b(k) 2: 3 so that 
M(k, b(k) - 1) = ° and 
M(k, b(k) - 2) > 0. 
(7) 
Then we slightly modify Xk near k +b(k) - 1 and extend it to (k +b(k) -1, k +b(k)J 
so that (7) holds for m = k + b(k) and 
Xk(k + b(k» = X£(k + b(k» = Xf(k + b(k» = 0. 
Finally we extend Xk to (k + b(k), +00) by the second equation of (6), and obtain 
the claim. 
For k 2: ko we define

Hk(X) = xk(lxI)H(x) + 2(1 - Xk(lxl»Bx . x,

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
where Mo = maxlxl::::ko H(x). Thus by (HBO) and (1) for Hand (11) the function Hk 
satisfies (HBO) for the same B E £s(R2n ), and H~(x) converges to Bx as Ixl -+ 00 
uniformly for all k 2': ko. Note that for each k 2': ko, the function Hk satisfies (HCl), 
(HBO), (R3), (R4), (HBl), (HB2), and 
(12) 
Step 2 An a priori estimate. 
Fix a k 2': ko. By (HCl) and (12), we apply the saddle point reduction method 
described in Chapter 4 to the system 
x = J H~(x), 
(13) 
to get the spaces L, W = domA with A = -Jd/dt, Zk, the map Uk : Zk -+ W, and 
the functionals /k, ak = /k 0 Uk. 
Next we derive an a priori estimate on the upper bound of IIx II c = maxO::::t::::T Ix(t) I 
for any critical point x of /k. 
Claim 2 There exists a constant kl 2': ko such that for any k 2': ko if Xk is a T -periodic 
solution of the system (13), then 
In fact, by (HBl) there exists a constant ex > 0 such that 
Fix k 2': ko. Let 
gkCy) = foT Hk(y(t))dt, 
Then gk is CIon L. By (HBO) and (11), we obtain 
Vy E W. 
Vy E L. 
(14)

(16) 
for lIyllL -+ 00 and y E L uniformly for all k 2': ko. Thus there exists a constant 
Ml 2': ko such that when k 2': ko, 
(17) 
Combining (15) and (17) we obtain 
(18) 

13.3 Asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems 
267 
Thus for any k :::: ko and any critical point Xk E W of fk it must hold that 
(19) 
for some M2 > 0 independent of k. Then by (10), (13), and (19), we obtain that for 
every t E R, 
rHk(Xk(t» 
foT HkCxk(S»ds 
< rMo + 2Ao foT IXk(s)12ds 
< rMo + 2AoMi· 
Combining (20) with (10) again yields 
Vt E R. 
(20) 
(21) 
This yields a uniform estimate of C-norm for all r-periodic solutions of (13) with 
k:::: ko: 
(22) 
Now together with (11), we obtain an integer kl such that (14) holds for any k :::: ko 
and any critical point x of fk. The claim is proved. 
Claim 3 ak satisfies the (PS) condition on Zk. 
In fact, by Claim 2, the critical points of fk are uniformly bounded in the balls in 
Land W centered at the origin with radius 2kr. By the definition of the injection 
Uk : Zk --+ W given in Section 4.3 by (4.3.17)-(4.3.18), the map Uk and its inverse 
map ukl are bounded maps, where ukl is defined on the image of Uk. Thus the 
critical points of ak are bounded. Therefore the claim follows from the finiteness of 
the dimension of Zk. 
Step 3 The existence of a solution Xk of (13). 
In this step, for each k :::: kl we prove the existence of a special r -periodic solution 
of the Hamiltonian system (13). For notational simplicity, in this step, we shall omit 
all the subindex k. 
By (R3) and Proposition 4.5.2, we obtain 
1 
a(z) :::: "2(A(P+w(z) + z), P+w(z) + Z)L - o(lIzIl 2) , 
(23) 
as z --+ 0 in Z.

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
Thus there exists p > ° 
small enough so that

VZEaBp(O,Z+), 
where Z+ is defined by (2.6), and aBp(O, Z+) is the boundary of the open ball 
Bp(O, Z+) in Z+ centered at the origin with radius p. Thus the condition (Fl) of 
Theorem 1.7 holds. 
On the other hand, by (HB2) and Theorem 6.1.1, there exists at least an element 
y E Z+ with lIyll = 1 and AI > ° 
such that 
(A - B)y = -AIY 
in L, 
(25) 
where (Bx, x) L2 = J; Bx(t) . x(t)dt for x E W. For large R > °

Q = {z = ry + Zo + z- E Zlzo + z- E ZO EB Z-, 
IIzo+z-lI.:::: R, 0.:::: r':::: R}. 
By (2.7) and (R4), we obtain 
a(z) .:::: 0, 
Vz = zo + z- E ZO EB Z-. 
For z = ry + zo + z- E aQ by (3) and (2.5) we have 
1 
a(z) .:::: 2(A(P-w(z) + ry + z-), P-w(z) + ry + Z-}L

Thus by taking R > 0 to be large enough we obtain 
a(z) :s 0, 
(31) 
for all z = ry + Zo + z-
E aQ with IIzo + z-II = R or r = R. Therefore the 
condition (F2) of Theorem 1.7 holds. Note that here by Theorem 6.1.1 with (J) = 1, 
for 2d = dim Z we have 
dim Q = dim(Z- EB Zo) + 1 = (d - n) + 2n + 1 = d + n + 1. 
(32) 
Note that there is a natural Sl action on W and Z defined by 
e * x(t) = x(t + e), 
"Ix E W, e E [0, r]/{O, r} = Sl. 
(33) 
Since a satisfies the (PS) condition, is S I-invariant on Z, and a" (z) is Fredholm if 
a' (z) = 0, by Theorem 1.7 we obtain a critical point z E Z of a whose Morse index 
m - (z) and nullity mO (z) satisfy 
(34) 
By Theorem 6.1.1 with (J) = 1, this implies that the index and nullity defined in 
Chapter 5 of x = u(z) as a solution of (13) satisfies (2). Note that by (24), we have 
f(x) > O. By (8), (R4), and (HBO) of Hk, this x is not a constant function. 
Step 4 Solutions of the system (0.1). 
Now for each k 2: ko, the above Step 3 yields a non-constant r-periodic solution 
Xk of the system (13) according to Hk, which satisfies (2). 
By our choice of kl in (14) and the definition of Xk in (6), any r-periodic solution 
Xk with k 2: kl is actually a r-periodic solution of (0.1) with the given Hamiltonian 
function H. 

270 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
Step 5 The above proof yields a non-constant r -periodic solution xo of (0.1), which 
satisfies (2). Thus (X4) holds for xo. Then by (HXl) and (HX2) for this Xo and 
Proposition 2.3, the solution Xo possesses minimal period r. 
The proof is complete. 
o 
The following corollary gives more accessible sufficient conditions for the existence 
of solutions with prescribed minimal period. 
Corollary 2 (D. Dong and Y. Long [DoLl]). For r > 0, suppose the Hamiltonian 
function H satisfies (HCl), (HBO), (HB 1), (HB2), (R3), and the conditions: 
(HC2) HI/(x):::: 0, i.e., HI/(x) possesses no negative eigenvaluesforallx E R2n. 
(HC3) The set D = (x E R 2n IH'(x) i= 0, 0 E a(HI/(x))} is hereditarily 
disconnected, i.e., every connected component of D contains only one 
point. 
Then the system (0.1) possesses a r-periodic solution x with r as its minimal period. 
Proof: Note that (R4) follows from (HCl), (R3), and (HC2). Thus (0.1) possesses 
at least one non-constant r-periodic solution Xo satisfying (2) and thus (X4) by the 
first part of Theorem 1. 
Now (HXl) for this Xo follows from (HC2). Then H'(xo(t)) i= 0 for all t E R. 
Thus (xo(t) It E R, 0 E a(HI/(xo(t)))} is a subset of D, hence is hereditarily 
disconnected. This implies (HX2) for xo. Now we can apply Proposition 2.3 to 
complete the proof.

Remark 3 To the author's knowledge, the study on periodic solutions of asymptoti-
cally linear Hamiltonian systems (ALHS for short) in the global sense started from 
the celebrated paper [AmZl] of H. Amann and E. Zehnder of 1980, who proved the 
existence of non-trivial I-periodic solutions for such systems with constant symmetric 
coefficients non-degenerate at zero and infinity under a twist condition. Since then 
many contributions on this problem have appeared, for example, the papers [Chal] 
ofK.C. Chang in 1981 and [LiLl] of S. Li and J.-Q. Liu in 1989. In [CoZ2] of 1984, 
C. Conley and E. Zehnder extended these results to ALHS which are non-degenerate at 
zero and infinity with continuous periodic symmetric coefficients in R 2n for n :::: 2. 
In [LZel] of 1990, E. Zehnder and the author extended this result to the case of 
n = 1. This problem was further studied in [Lon5] of 1990 and the non-degeneracy 
condition at zero was removed. In 1997, in [CLLl] of K.C. Chang, J.-Q. Liu, and 
M.-J. Liu and in [FeQ2] of G. Fei and Q. Qiu independently, the non-degeneracy 
condition at infinity was removed. Note that these mentioned results are closely 
related to the famous Poincare-Birkhoff theorem on the existence of fixed points 
of area preserving homeomorphisms on an annulus under twist conditions on the 
boundary. The following is one of the theorems on ALHS proved in [CLLI] and 
[FeQ2]: 

13.4 Superquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
271 
Suppose the function H satisfies the following conditions: 
(ALl) HE C2(R X R 2n , R) is I-periodic in time t and satisfies 
IH"(t, x)1 ::: a(1 + Ixl iL), 
V(t,x) E R x R 2n , 
(35) 
where a > 0 and fL > 1 are constants. 
(AL2) There exists I-periodic matrix function Bo E C(R, .cs(R2n )) such that 
H'(t, x) = Bo(t)x + o(lxi) 
as 
Ixl ~ 0 uniformly in t. 
(36) 
(AL3) There exists I-periodic matrix function Boo E C(R, .cs(R2n )) such that 
H' (t, x) = Boo(t)x + o(lx I) 
as 
Ix I ~ 00 uniformly in t. (37) 
(AL4) For h(t, x) = H(t, x) - Boo(t)x with (t, x) E R X R2n, either 
h(t, x) ~ 0,

or

Theorem 4 (K.C. Chang, J.-Q. Lin, and M.-J. Lin [CLUJ, G. Fei and Q. Qin 
[FeQ2]). Suppose H satisfies the conditions (ALl)-(AL4). Then the problem 
x = J H'(t, x), 
(40) 
xCI) = x(O), 
(41) 
possesses a non-trivial I-periodic solution, provided that indices o/the corresponding 
linear Hamiltonian systems satisfy 
Here the index theory is used to measure the twist of the Poincare map of the 
nonlinear problem (40)-(41) between the origin and infinity. We refer readers to 
[CLLlJ and [FeQ2] for the proof of Theorem 4 and further results on ALHS. 
13.4 Snperquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
In this section we study autonomous Hamiltonian systems 
-J x = iI' (x), 
(1) 
where iI (x) = 4 Bx . x + H (x). Here we suppose B satisfies the following condition: 

272 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
(B) B 
E Ls(R2n) is semi-positive definite, i.e., B possesses no negative 
eigenvalues. The operator norm of B is denoted by w = II B II. 
The following is our main result in this section. 
Theorem 1 (G. Fei and Q. Qiu [FeQl], C. Liu and Y. Long [LLo3]). Suppose the 
matrix B satisfies the condition (B), and the function H satisfies conditions (HC1), 
(R2), (R3), and (R4). Then for every 0 < r < 2;, the system (1) possesses a 
non-constant r-periodic solution Xo satisfying 
n + 2 - v(xo. 1) S i(xo, 1) S n + 1. 
(2) 
Moreover, suppose this solution Xo satisfies the conditions (HX1) and (HX2). Then 
r is the minimal period of xo. 
Proof: The proof is carried out in several steps. 
Step 1 The truncation of the Hamiltonian function. 
For k 2': I to be determined later, following Rabinowitz's pioneering work [Rab2] 
we choose Xk E eXl(R, R) such that Xk(t) = 1 if t S k, Xk(t) = 0 if t 2': k + 1, and 
X~(t) < 0 ift E (k, k + 1). Set 
(3) 
and 
where the constant R K is chosen to satisfy 
{ H(x) 
} 
Rk 2': max ~ 
I k S Ix I s k + 1 . 
In the following we denote by ai or Ki the positive constants which are independent 
or dependent on k respectively without further explanations. 
Then this Hk still satisfies conditions (HCl), (R2) with IL replaced by the number 
rJ = min{IL, 4}, (R3), and (R4). Consequently there exist positive constants at and 
a2 such that for any integer k 2': ro, 
{ 0 < rJatlxll1 S rJHk(X) S H,,(x) . x, 
Hk(X) 2': aJlxI 11 -a2, 
Vlxl 2': ro, 
Vx E R2n. 
Note that for k 2': ro there exist positive constants Kt, K2, and K3 such that 
for all x E R 2n .

13.4 Superquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
273 
As in Section 4.1, let W = W 1/2,2(ST, R2n) with the norm (4.1.5). For any k :::: 1, 
we define a functional fk on W by 
1 iT 
A 
fk(X) = -
(x· Jx - Hk(X))dt, 'Ix E W. 
2 ° 
(6) 
According to the operator A induced by -J 1ft via (4.1.6) being positive, null, and 
negative definite respectively, W possesses a decomposition 
(7) 
with WO = R2n. 
For mEN, let Wm be the space defined by (4.1.14) for A defined by -Jdjdt 
via (4.1.6) and Boo = 0, and {Pm : W ~ Wm} be the corresponding Galerkin 
approximation scheme with respect to A. Let W;;; = Wm n W* for * = +,0, and-. 
Let!k,m = fklwm • 
Step 2 The Palais-Smale conditions. 
For k :::: ro we need the following claims. 
Claim 1 Each fk always satisfies the (PS) condition on Wm for any mEN. 
Claim 2 fk satisfies the (P S)~ condition on W for c E R , i.e., any sequence {Xm} 
satisfyingxm E Wm, f£,m(xm) ~ Oandfk(xm) ~ casm ~ +00 always possesses 
a convergent subsequence in W. 
In fact, we fix such a sequence {xm} and prove Claim 2 in the following. The 
similar proof of Claim 1 is left to the readers. In the following we denote by bi or Ki 
the positive constants which are independent or dependent on k respectively without 
further explanations. The proof is given in two substeps. 
(A) Boundedness of{xm} in W. 
By the definition of {xm} and (4), 
a3 + Ilxmll > 
1 
I 
!k,m(xm) - 2 (fk,m(xm), Xm) 
iT (~H£(Xm) . Xm - Hk(Xm)) dt 
> (~-~) foT H{(xm) 'Xmdt -a4 
> G -1) foT Hk(Xm) dt - a4 
> a5l1xmlll ~ -a6· 
(8) 
Writing Xm = x;; + x~ + x;;; according to the decomposition (7), then (8) implies 
(9) 

274 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
For m > ° 
great enough, letting ~ = x;:; in 
I(AXm, 0 - foT (Bxm + H~(xm» . ~dtl 
= 1 (f{,m(xm), 01 ~ II~II, 
V~ E Wm, 
and using the HOlder inequality and the inequality (4.1.5), by (5) we obtain 
211x;:;112 = (Axm, x;:;) 
~ foT IBxm + H~(xm)lIx;:;ldt + II x;:; II 
~ K4 foT (1 + IxmI3)lx;:;ldt + IIx;:;1I 
~ K5(1 + IIxmlli4)lIx;:;lI. 
Thus together with (5), (8), and Sobolev embedding theorem (4.1.5), 
II x;:; II < K6 (1 + (foT IXkl4dty/4) 
< K7(1 + IIxmIl 3/4). 
(10) 
Similarly, we obtain an estimate on II x,:;; II as in (10). Together with (9), we then have 
(11) 
Therefore {xm} is bounded in W. 
(B) The convergence of some subsequence. 
The condition f~ m (xm) ~ ° 
as m ~ +00 implies 
(12) 
with 
IIEmllw,;, ~ 0, as m ~ +00. 
By Step (A), 
Thus by passing to a subsequence, we may assume that 
Xm ~x 
in 
W weakly, 
In 
LP strongly for any 1 ~ p < +00, 
In 
R2n. 

13.4 Superquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
275 
By (5), this implies iI~(xm) ~ iI~(x) strongly in L2. Thus PmiI~(xm) ~ iI~(x) 
strongly in L2, and thus in W'. Therefore (12) implies that 
im = ~m + Em, 
(13) 
holds in W', where ~m ~ 
~ = J iI~ (x) in L 2. This then implies 
(14) 
in W'. Since ~ E L2, then x E W I,2 and thus x E C2, i.e., (14) holds in the classical 
sense. Because W m is a subspace of the Hilbert space W with the reduced norm, 
Ilxm -
Pmxll~ = lIim -
Pmill~, + Ix~ - x012. 
m 
m 
Then 
From 
for some M > 0 independent of m, we then obtain 
This proves Xm ~ x in W strongly. The proof of Claim 2 is completed. 
Step 3 The existence of a critical point Xk of!k on W with kEN. 
We prove first that ik,m possesses a critical point Xk,m in Wm satisfying the index 
estimate for m > n. 
In fact, note that 
(15) 
Firstly by the conditions (B), (R3) for H, and the definition of Hk, for any E E (0, 1] 
there exists 8 > 0 such that 
Vlxl ::s 8. 
Thus there exists K 10 (E) > 0 depending on k and E such that 
Hk(X) ::s Elxl2 + KIO(E)lxI4 , 
Vx E R2n. 
(16) 
Therefore for any x E W+, by (16) we obtain 

276 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
When (J) > 0, by (15) we then obtain 
where C2 is the Sobolev embedding constant given by (4.1.5). Thus by the definition 
of r, we can fix E > 0 sufficiently small independent of k first and then choose 
p(k) E (0, 1] and Ck > 0 small and depending on k such that 
!k,m(x) ~ Ck > 0, 
Vx E 8Bp(k) (0) n W,;;. 
(17) 
When (J) = 0, B = O. Thus from (R3) for H and (16), we also get (17). Therefore 
the condition (Fl) of Theorem 1.7 holds. 
Secondly, for m > n, set 
where e E 8 BI (0) n W,;;, rl and r2 are positive constants to be determined later. By 
(4) for r E [0, rtJ and x = re + xo + x- E 8Qm with x- E W- and xo E Wo, we 
obtain

(19) 
for some a7 > 0 independent of m and k. Combining (18) and (19) together yields 
for some ag > 0 independent of m and k. Thus we can choose large enough rl and 
r2 > 1 independent of m and k such that 
(21) 
Therefore the condition (F2) of Theorem 1.7 holds. 

13.4 Superquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
277 
Note that by our above discussion, there exists a constant a9 > 0 independent of 
m and k such that 
(22) 
Now since f£:m (x) is Fredholm at any critical point x, and Am is SI-invariant 
under the Sl-action (3.33) on Wm , by Claim 1, (17), (21), and (22), we can apply 
Theorem 1.7 and obtain a critical pointxk,m E Wm of fk,m for each m, which satisfies 
and 
m-(Xk,m) < dim(W';:;- EB W~) + 1 
m+2n+l 
< m-(Xk.m) +mo(Xk,m)-1. 
This completes our study of the critical point Xk,m of fk,m. 
(23) 
(24) 
Now by Claim 2 and (23), {Xk.m} possesses a subsequence which converges to 
some Xk in W, which is a critical point of fk. Thus it is a non-constant solution of 
(1) with H replaced by Hk, and then we obtain Xk E C1(S" R 2n ). By (23) this Xk 
further satisfies 
Step 4 The energy estimate and existence. 
By (4), similarly to (8) we obtain

Hk(Xk(t» = "2BXk(t) . Xk(t) + Hk(Xk(t» :::: a12, 
for any t E [0, rl. By the semi-positive definiteness of B given by (B) and (4), we 
then obtain a constant al3 > 0 independent of k such that 
(28) 
Then choose k 2:: al3 + 1 + r3 == bl, and let Xo = Xk. By (28) and the definition (3) 
of fIk, this Xo is a non-constant classical solution of (1). 
Step 5 The index and nullity estimates. 
For any k 2:: bl, let Bk(t) = fIk'(Xk(t» and Bk be the linear operator defined by 
(4.1.10) corresponding to Bk(t). Then we have 
dim ker(A - Bk) = v(Xk, 1). 
(29) 
Let 8 = 8(k) = !II(A - Bk)#II-1 with (A - Bk)# = [(A -
Bk)II~(A_Bkl' As we 
have pointed out in Section 4.1, the value 0 is isolated in the set {OJ U a(A - Bd· 
Therefore for any k 2:: bl, there exists m I = m I (k) depending only on k such that for 
any m 2:: ml and any U E Ei(k)(Pm(A - Bk)Pm), 
IIPm(A - Bk)Pmull > 3811Pmull, 
(Pm(A - Bk)PmU, Pmu) :::: -38I1PmuII2. 
Since 1£'(Xk) = A - Bk, we have 
1I/£,(z) - (A -
Bk)1I ~ 0 as liz - xkll ~ o. 
Thus there exists a r4 > 0 sufficiently small such that 
1I/£,(z) - (A - Bdll < 8, Vz E Br4 (Xk). 
Hence there exists m2 = m2(k) 2:: m) such that for all m 2:: m2, 
(30) 
(31) 
(32) 
(33) 
Then using notations in (7.1.4), and U E Ei (Pm(A - Bk)Pm) \ {OJ for m 2:: m2, by 
(31) and (33) we obtain 
U{m(Xk.m)U, u} 
:::: (Pm(A - Bk)PmU, Pmu) + II/£'m(Xk,m) 
-Pm(A - Bk)PmllllPmulI2

Vu E Ei(Pm(A - Bk)Pm). 
(34) 

13.4 Superquadratic Hamiltonian systems 
Thus 
By Corollary 7.1.10, (24) and (35), for all m :::: m2 we obtain 
2n + m + 1 = dim Qm 
> m-(Xk.m) 
> m"i(Pm(A - Bk)Pm) 
= m + n + i (Xk, 1). 
279 
(35) 
(36) 
This implies i (Xk, 1) :s n + 1. Thus the right-hand side inequality of (2) holds for Xo 
chosen in Step 4. 
Similarly to the proof of (35), we obtain m3 = m3(k) :::: m2 such that 
Thus by Corollary 7.1.10, (24) and (37), for all m :::: m3 we obtain 
2n + m + 1 = dim Qm 
:s m-(Xk,m) + mO(Xk,m) - 1 
dim Wm - m+(xk m) - 1 
< 2(m + n) - mi(Pm(A - BdPm) - 1 
2(m + n) -
(m + n - i(xk, 1) - v(Xk, 1» -
1. 
(37) 
(38) 
This implies n + 1 :s i(Xk, 1) + V(Xk, 1) -
1. Thus the left-hand side inequality of 
(2) holds for Xo chosen in Step 4. 
Step 6 The minimal period of Xo. 
Denote the minimal period of this solution x by Tj m for some mEN. By the 
conditions (HX1), (HX2) and (B), we can use Proposition 2.3 to conclude m = 1 and 
complete the proof. 
D 
Remark 2 If B = 0, we can choose w = 0, and then 2n jw = +00. Thus in this case 
for every T > 0, Theorem 1 holds. 
The following corollary gives more accessible sufficient conditions for the existence 
of solutions with prescribed minimal period. 
Corollary 3 Suppose the conditions (B), (HC1), (R2), (R3), (R4), (HC2), and (HC3) 
hold. Thenforevery 0 < T < 2:, the system (1) possesses a non-constant T-periodic 
solution Xo with T as its minimal period. 
Proof: The conclusion follows from Theorem 1 and the second paragraph in the 
proof of Corollary 3.2.

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
At the end of this section we apply the iteration theory to Hamiltonian systems 
defined on R 2 with no convexity type conditions. 
Theorem 4 Suppose the Hamiltonian function H satisfies the condition (HC 1) on 
R 2. For T > 0, let x E C2 (Sr, R 2) be a non-constant T -periodic solution of the 
system (0.1). 1fthe index ofx satisfies the condition 
(X6) 2 - v(x, 1) :::: i(x, 1) :::: 2, 
then the solution x possesses minimal period T. 
Proof: Let ex = T / m be the minimal period of x for some mEN. Then (X6) 
implies (10.3.24). Since x is a non-constant a-periodic solution of the autonomous 
system (0.1), we obtain Va (x) 2: 1. Thus Theorem 10.3.7 yields m = 1. 
0 
Corollary 5 When n = 1, the T -periodic non-constant solution Xo found by the first 
part of the above Theorem 1 or 3.1 possesses minimal period T. 
Remark 6 Based on the iteration results and the idea of relating the indices to the 
minimal periods of solutions of [DoLl], G. Fei and Q. Qiu using the Galerkin approxi-
mation method obtained Theorem 1 with B == 0 in [FeQI]. The full Theorem I was 
proved by C. Liu and the author in [LLo3] which generalized the result in [FeQI]. 
Note that the proof of the (PS)~ condition in Step 2 of the proof of Theorem I uses 
an idea of A. Bahri and H. Berestycki in [BaB2]. 
13.5 Second order systems 
In this section, we consider the existence of non-constant periodic solutions with 
prescribed minimal period for the autonomous second order Hamiltonian systems, 
x+V'(x)=O, 
(1) 
where V : R n -+ R is a function, and V' denotes its gradient. Rabinowitz's conjec-
ture also includes the system (1) when V satisfies conditions similar to (RI)-(R4). 
Our main results in this section are the following theorems which give partial answers 
to Rabinowitz's conjecture under precisely his structure conditions (V2)-(V 4) as well 
as (V5). 
Theorem 1 Suppose V satisfies the following conditions. 
(VI) V E C2(Rn , R). 
(V2) There exist constants J-t > 2 and ro > 0 such that 
0< J-tV(x) :::: V'(x) . x, 
(V3) V(x) 2: 0, 
"Ix ERn. 
(V4) V(x) = 0(lxI 2), at x = O. 

13.5 Second order systems 
281 
Then for every r > 0, the system (1) possesses a non-constant r-periodic even 
solution with minimal period r / m for some integer m satisfying 1 :::: m :::: n + l. 
Theorem 2 Suppose V satisfies conditions (VI)-(V3) and the condition 
(V5) There exist constants (j) > 0 and rl > 0 such that 
Thenfor every positive 0 < r < n /.jW, the conclusion of Theorem 1 holds. 
Our proof depends on an inequality, Theorem 4 below, of iterated Morse indices 
for the functional corresponding to (1) defined on even function spaces. 
Let Er = W I ,2(S" Rn), with the norm 
Vx E E,. 
The functional corresponding to the system (1) is defined by 
(2) 
Define 
SET = {x E E, I x( -t) = x(t), Vt E R}. 
Because 
frCx) = fr(x), 
Vx E E r , 
(3) 
where x(t) = x( -t), it is easy to prove (cf. [Lon9]) that the critical points of fr 
restricted to SET are in one to one correspondence to r-periodic even solutions of the 
system (1). 
For any critical point x of f, I SET the following bilinear form is defined by J;' (x) 
on SET: 
<Pr(Y, z) = for {,y . Z - A(t)y . z}dt, 
Vy, z E SEr, 
(4) 
where A(t) = VI/(x(t) satisfies the condition 
(AS) A E C(Sr, Ls(Rn» and A(t) is even about t = O. 
Note that <Pr corresponds to the linear second order Hamiltonian system 
y + A(t)y = 0, 
Vy E Rn. 
(5) 

282 
13 
The Rabinowitz conjecture 
We write CPr(x) = CPr (x, x). Note that under (AS), SEr possesses a cpr-orthogonal 
decomposition 
SEr = SE: E9 SE~ E9 SE:;, 
(6) 
according to CPr being positive, null, and negative definite respectively. 
If x is a non-constant critical point of ir in SEr, then i is a non-trivial solution of 
(5) with A(t) = Vl/(x(t)), and i E Er is odd aboutt = O. Thus we define the space 
of such odd solutions of (5) by 
OE~ = {y E Er I y is an odd solution of (5)}. 
Definition 3 We define 
sir = dim SE:; 
and 
OVr = dim OE~, 
and call them the symmetric index and odd nullity of x. 
(7) 
It is an exercise for the readers that the symmetric index is always finite. The 
following estimate describes the iteration property of Morse indices. 
Theorem 4 Suppose the condition (AS) holds. Then 
simr 2: m min{ovr, I}, 
"1m EN. 
(8) 
Proof: We carry out the proof in two steps. 
Step 1 Suppose oVr 2: 1 and fix an integer mEN. Fix u E OE~ \ {O}. We define 
new functions u+ and u_ E C(Smr, Rn) by 
() 
{ U(t), 
u+ t = 
0,

."v(t) = v(t - TI2), 
"Iv E C(Smr, Rn). 
Now we define a sequence of functions {Ui} for 1 :::: i :::: m based on u by: 
Ui = ."i-lu+ -

if i E 2N - 1, 
and define N = span{ui 11 :::: i :::: m}.

Since all the Ui s have mutually disjoint supports, they are linearly independent. 
Note that each Ui E Emr is even, and

Since U E OE~\ {O}, we obtain U(O) = u(r) f::. 0 and u(r /2) f::. O. Therefore each 
Ui is not C 1, and therefore does not belong to ker ¢r in Er. Since Um is not C 1 at 
t = m r /2, any function in N \ {O} is not C 1. Therefore we obtain 
N n ker¢mr = {OJ.

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
If i is even, from the definition of Uj, we obtain similarly 
(16) 
Note that (13), (15), and (16) imply 
(17) 
Step 2 Let P;;;T : N ~ SE;;'T be the orthogonal projection. For 0 =1= v == v_ + vo + 
v+ E N n (SE;;'T E9 SE~T E9 SE;t;T)' we have 
(18) 
If v_ = 0, we would have v+ = 0 by (18). Thus 0 =1= Vo = v E N n SE~T. This 
contradicts (14). Then P;;;T v = v_ =1= O. Therefore P;;;, is injective. Since it is linear, 
we obtain 
m = dim N :::: dim SE;;', = simT • 
The proof is complete. 
(19) 
o 
Now we can give the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2. Since they are similar to that of 
Theorem 4.1 in a certain sense, we are very sketchy here. 
Proof of Theorem 1: Let X = SET' Z = R2n, and 
Y = {x ESE, Ix(O) = OJ. 
(20) 
By the conditions (Vl)-(V4), similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1, the functional I, 
satisfies the (PS) condition, (Fl), and (F2) of Theorem 1.7. I:'(x) is Fredholm for 
x E K (fT ). Thus by Theorem 1.7, for any i > 0 we obtain a critical point x of IT 
on SET satisfying 
siT(x) :::: n + 1, 
IT(X) > O. 
(21) 
Together with (V3), this x is a non-constant i-periodic even solution of (1). Denote 
the minimal period of x by i / m for some mEN. Since (1) is autonomous, we have 
i E OE,/m \{O}. Thus oV,/m(x) 2: 1. Applying Theorem 4 we obtain m :::: n + 1. o 
Proof of Theorem 2: The proof is similar to that of Theorem 1, except the verifi-
cation of the condition (Fl) in Theorem 1.7, which follows from (V5) and the def-
inition of i instead of (V4) as follows. For any x E Y defined by (20), since 
x(O) = X(i) = 0, by Poincare-Wirtinger inequality we have

In [Lon8] of 1993, the system (1) with even potentials was further studied, and the 
following results were obtained. 
Theorem 5 1 ° Suppose V satisfies the conditions (V 1 )-(V 4) and 
(V6) V is even, i.e. , V(-x) = V(x)foranyx ERn. 
Then for every r > 0, the system (1) possesses a non-constant r -periodic 
solution with minimal period r or r / 3, which is even with respect to t = 0 
and odd with respect to t = r /4. 
2° Suppose V satisfies conditions (VI)-(V3), (V5), and (V6). Then for every 
positive 0 < r < ][ /.jU), the conclusion of 1 ° holds. 
The proof of this result is similar to those of Theorems 1 and 2. Here we consider 
the functional fT of (5.2) defined on a new symmetric function space 
SET = {x E E, I x( -t) = x(t), x (~ + t) = -x (~ + t), 'It E R} . 
Then a new iteration inequality of the Morse index theory of f, is proved, which 
yields the above theorem. We omit it here and refer the readers to [Lon8] for details. 
Remark 6 Theorems 1 and 2 are taken from [Lon9] in 1994 and [LonI2] in 1997. The 
Step 2 of the proof of Theorem 4 uses an idea of Dr. Guangcun Lu which simplified 
the original proof in [Lon9]. In these two papers and [Lon8] of 1993, one can find 
further developments on this problem. We suspect that the r / 3 in Theorem 5 can be 
eliminated. 
13.6 
Subharmonics 
We start from the autonomous Hamiltonian systems 
x(t) = J H' (x(t)), 
x E R2n.

We call two r-periodic solution Xl and X2 of (1) geometrically distinct if 
XI (R) i- x2(R).

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
Theorem 1 Let H satisfy conditions (Hel), (R2), (R3), (R4). For any s > 0, we 
denote by Xs the non-constant s-periodic solution of (1) produced by Theorem 4.1, 
which satisfies 
n + 2 - v(xs, 1) ::::; i(xs, 1) ::::; n + 1. 
(3) 
Let Os = XS (R) be the orbit of Xs. Then this yields a one parameter family of non-
constant periodic solution orbits of (1). Denote the minimal period of Xs by h(s). 
Thus ° 
< h (s) ::::; s holds. For any two positive real numbers j and k, let 
k =max -- --

Proof: Without loss of generality, we suppose p(j, k) = ht-). 
When p(j, k) E R \N, clearly Xk can not be any phase ~hift of any iteration of 
Xh(j), and then is geometrically distinct from x j. 
When p(j, k) E Nand p(j, k) > n + 1/2, we assume Xj and Xk are not geomet-
rically distinct. Then Xk must be a phase shift ofthe p(j, k)-th iteration of Xh(j). By 
(10.3.1) of Lemma 10.3.1 and the above (3), we then obtain

This is a contradiction and proves the theorem.

Remark 2 After his pioneering work [Rab2], P. Rabinowitz proved in 1983 the 
following remarkable result by using an Sl symmetry method and certain increasing 
estimates on critical values: 
Theorem 3 (P. Rabinowitz [Rab6]). 10 Suppose the conditions (Rl) and (R2) hold. 
For any positive real numbers rand R the autonomous Hamiltonian system 
(0.1) possesses a non-constant r-periodic solution x such that 
Ilxllc:::: R. 

13.6 Subharrnonics 
20 Suppose the conditions (V2) and the following (VI') hold: 
(VI') V E C 1 (Rn, R). 
287 
For any positive real numbers rand R the autonomous second order Hamil-
tonian system (5.1) possesses a non-constant r-periodic solution x such that 
IIxlic :=:: R. 
Note that the above Theorem 1 and Rabinowitz's result clarify the solution structure 
of (1) from different angles. 
Next we consider the periodic boundary value problem of non-autonomous Hamil-
tonian systems 
{ X(t) 
= fH'(t,x), 
x(mr) = x(O), 
(8) 
for some mEN. Here we suppose H(t, x) is r-periodic in t for some r > O. As 
usual, mr-periodic solutions of (8) are called subharmonics. For any mr-periodic 
solution x of (8) and any k E Z, the phase shift k * x of x is defined by 
(k * x)(t) = x(t + kr). 
(9) 
We call two solutions XI and X2 of (8) geometrically distinct if 
Vk, hE Z. 
(10) 
Theorem 4 (T. Wang and G. Fei [WaFt]). 10 Suppose H (t, x) satisfies the con-
dition (HI) in §4.Ifor some r > 0 and the following conditions: 
(H4) There exist p., > 2 and ro > 0 such that 
0< p.,H(t, x) :s H/(t , x) . x , 
V(t,x) E R x R2n. 
(H5) H(t, x) = o(lxI2) at x = O. 
(H6) H(t, x) :=:: H(t, 0) = Of or any (t, x) E R x R2n. 
(H7) There exist constants f3 > 0 and rt > 0 such that 
IH/(t,x)l:S f3H /(t,x) ·x, 
"It E R, Ixl:=:: rl. 
Then for any mEN, the problem (8) possesses a non-constant 
m r -periodic solution Xm which satisfies 
n + 1 - v(xm , 1) :s i(xm , 1) :s n + 1. 
(11) 
Moreover, Xm and xmp are geometrically distinct provided p > 2n + 1. 

288

The Rabinowitz conjecture 
2° We further suppose the following conditions: 
(H8) H"(t,x) 2: O. 
(H9) The set D = {(t, x) E R x R n I H"(t, x) i= 0, 0 E a(H"(t, x))} is 
hereditarily discontinuous. 
Then for any mEN, the system (8) possesses an m1:-periodic solution such 
that (11) holds and m 1: is its minimal period. 
Remark 5 Theorem 4 is due to T. Wang and G. Fei in [WaFl]. The proof of 1 ° of 
this theorem is similar to that of the above Theorem 1. The proof of the second part 
is similar to those of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.3. Thus they are omitted here. We 
refer readers to [WaFl] and [Lic1] for further details. 
The study on subharmonics by variational methods was started from the paper 
[Rab4] of P. Rabinowitz in 1980. Among many other results, [EkH3] of I. Ekeland 
and H. Hofer in 1987 got interesting progress. Here the geometric distinction part 
of Theorem 1 is new. Theorem 4 was proved by T. Wang and G. Fei via the method 
of [DoLl] and the Galerkin method in [FeQ2] which further generalized results of 
[EkH3]. We also refer readers to [Lic1] of C. Liu for further discussions on this 
problem. 
13.7 Notes and comments 
For Rabinowitz's prescribed minimal period solution conjecture, we tend to believe 
that one should construct counterexamples now to show that beyond Theorem 4.1 
and Corollary 4.3 there is almost nothing more one can hope for. 
We point out that there may be some substantial difference between first order 
and second order Hamiltonian systems, because estimates on the minimal period of 
solutions obtained by variational methods for first order Hamiltonian systems similar 
to those of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 are still unknown under precisely Rabinowitz's 
original structure conditions. 
Next we make some comments on the study of superquadratic Hamiltonian sys-
tems (0.1) and (5.1). Note that the proof of Theorem 5.3 in [Rab6] depends on the 
autonomous property of the systems (0.1) and (5.1) crucially, which implies that the 
corresponding variational functionals possess certain Sl-symmetry. A natural ques-
tion is what will happen if such a symmetry is broken. There are many studies of this 
problem too. After significant progress on this problem obtained by P. Rabinowitz in 
[Rab5] of 1982 and by A. Bahri and H. Berestycki in [BaB 1] of 1984 on the perturbed 
second order Hamiltonian systems 
x+V'(x)=f(t), 
for xERn , 
(1) 
the following result was proved in [Lon2] of 1989: 

13.7 Notes and comments 
289 
Theorem 1 Suppose the conditions (VI') in Theorem 6.3 and (V2) in Theorem 5.1 
hold. Then given any r > 0 and any f E L2(R/(rZ), R n ), for any R > 0 the 
second order system (1) possesses a non-constant r-periodic solution x satisfying 
Ilxllc 2: R. 
The proof of Theorem 1 depends on an optimal increasing estimate 
Ck 
k2 ~ +00, 
as k ~ +00, 
of critical values {Ck} of the functional corresponding to the autonomous system (5.1) 
obtained by the SI-symmetry method, and a new Sl action introduced in [Lon2]. 
Related results for the perturbed Hamiltonian system 
x - J H'(x) = f(t) 
can be found in [BaB2] of A. Bahri and H. Berestycki in 1984, and [LonI], [Lon3], 
and [Lon4] of the author in 1989 to 1990. 
It should be pointed out that under conditions for V (t, x) similar to (VI), (V2) 
in Theorem 5.1, and that Vet, x) is r-periodic in t, it is still unknown whether the 
conclusion of above Theorem 1 holds for the general non-autonomous systems

Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
We consider the periodic solution problem for the Lagrangian system 
d 
dt LAt, x, x) - Lx{t, x, x) = 0, 
x ERn, 
(1) 
where Lx and Lx denote the gradients of L with respect to x and x respectively. The 
following conditions on the Lagrangian function L are assumed. 
(U) L(t, x, p) = 1A{t)p. P + V(t, x), where 1A(t)p . p :::: Alpl2 for all 
(t, p) E R x R n and some fixed constant A> O. 
(L2) A E C\R, Cs(Rn», V E C3(R x Rn, R), both A and V are I-periodic in 
all of their variables. 
Let L satisfy the conditions (U) and (L2). The system (1) can be viewed as defined 
on the standard torus Tn = R n /zn . We search for .-periodic solutions of the system 
(1) with. E N. Solutions x(t) of (1) on Tn determines a one-parameter family of 
diffeomorphisms "'i E Diff(TTn) satisfying "'i (x(O), x(O» = (x(t), x(t», where 
T Tn is the tangent bundle of Tn. Here we call the time-I-map '" L = "'l the 
Lagrangian diffeomorphism of the system (1) corresponding to the Lagrangian 
function L. The mUltiplicity of periodic points of this diffeomorphism is an interesting 
problem considered by many mathematicians. Our aim here is to prove Theorem B 
in the Introduction, i.e., the following theorem proved by the author in [LonI7]. 
Theorem 1 Suppose the function L satisfies the conditions (U) and (L2). Then the 
corresponding Lagrangian diffeomorphism '" L possesses infinitely many periodic 
points on TTn produced by contractible integer periodic solutions of the system (1). 
Fix L satisfying (U) and (L2). For any • E N, let Sr = R/(.Z) and Er = 
W 1,2 (Sr, R n) with the usual inner product and the norm: 
Define 
fmr 
fm(x) = 10 
L(t, x, x)dt, 
v x E Emr , mEN. 
(2) 
By the conditions (U) and (L2), it is well known that fm E C\Emr , R) satisfies 
the Palais-Smale condition and that critical points of fm correspond to contractible 
m. -periodic solutions of (1.1) on Tn. But for distinct h, kEN, although two critical 
points x E Eh of fh and y E Ek of!k are different in this analytical setting, they may 

14.0 Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
291 
produce the same periodic point for <1> L on Tn. To get over this obstacle, we consider 
the following analytic concepts of iterations and towers. 
Let x E Er with r E N. Using iteration of x defined by (8.1.2), we define the 
iteration map 1/rm : Er -+ Emr by 1/rm(x) = xm. In this case, we call {Xm}mEN C 
ITmEN Em, the tower based on x E E,. A tower {x P } based on x E E, is called a 
subtower of another tower {yq} based on y E Ea, if there exists kEN and j E zn 
such that x = yk + j. Two towers {x P} based on x E E, and {yq} based on y E Ea 
are called Tn-distinct, if there exists no tower {zm} based on Z E Ef3, h, kEN, and 
i, j E zn such that x = Zh + i and y = Zk + j. Note that the functional f m defined 
by (2) satisfies 
VXEE"jEZn,r,mEN. 
(3) 
Here the solution tower is an analytic, not a geometric, concept. Using this concept, 
Theorem 1 can be rephrased as the following 
Theorem 2 Suppose the function L satisfies the conditions (Ll) and (L2). Then 
the system (1) possesses infinitely many Tn -distinct solution towers based on integer 
periodic solutions in Rn. 
Remark 3 When (U) and (L2) hold and V is time independent, using ideas in [LonI7] 
and [BaKI], recently G. Lu and the author have proved in [LoLl] that the autonomous 
Lagrangian system (1) always possesses infinitely many Tn-distinct solution orbits 
based on integer periodic solutions in Rn. Thus we suspect that (l) always possesses 
infinitely many contractible integer periodic solutions with mutually distinct solution 
orbits on Tn provided (Ll) and (L2) hold. 
Following ideas in [LonI7], we prove Theorem 2 indirectly by assuming that its 
conclusion does not hold. Then in Section 4, we find a critical point x of h with 
c = h (x) for some integer r E N such that the critical module en (fl , x) i= 0 and 
by the m-th iteration this module is injectively mapped into a global homological 
module Hn(Em" (fm)~(C- E) for E > 0 small enough (cf. Theorem 4.3 below). On 
the other hand, in Section 5 we prove that a Lagrangian version homotopy similar to 
the Bangert homotopy technique in [BanI] and [BaKI] can be constructed via a new 
finite energy homology theory. Then we use this homotopy to show that through the 
above injective iteration homomorphism, a non-trivial finite energy singular chain 
must vanish provided m is great enough (cf. Proposition 5.2 below). Then they 
produce a contradiction that proves Theorem 2. 
Our Theorems 1 and 2 together with the above mentioned proof are closely related 
to the work [BaKI] of V. Bangert and W. Klingenberg who studied the case of closed 
geodesics on product Riemannian manifolds including Tn. But results of [BaKI] 
(e.g., their Theorems 1 to 3) can not be applied to (1) directly, because the functional 
h of (2) is strongly indefinite, all the critical points we found are non-minimal saddle 
points (cf. our discussion below in (4.4» , and the Morse index iteration formula of 
closed geodesics used in [BaKI] is not applicable to (1). Moreover, in the proof of 
Theorem Ion page 382 in [BaKI], which is explained in detail in Section 2 of [BanI] 

292 
14 Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
of V. Bangert, the curve shortening process for geodesics is a crucial ingredient to 
gain the smoothness of the initial point curves of a given singular simplex in the 
loop space. But it is not clear to the author whether this process can be applied to 
the indefinite functional II and its non-minimal saddle points. In order to overcome 
these difficulties, we have used two new ingredients. 
(A) We need the iteration theory of the index for symplectic paths in the previ-
ous chapters, especially the iteration inequality Theorem 10.1.2 which estimates the 
iterated index in terms of the mean index. This inequality yields the homological 
injectivity obtained in Theorem 4.3 mentioned above. 
(B) A new finite energy singular homology and cohomology theory is introduced 
in this paper. Since the curve shortening process for geodesics used in [BaKl] fails 
in our case, our new idea here is to mount this required condition of smoothness of 
initial point curves to all singular simplexes in the loop space appearing in the homo-
logy theory. All such simplexes form a new homology theory, i.e., the finite energy 
homology theory introduced in Section 2 below. Then every generator of the non-
trivial critical module en (fl, x) found in Theorem 4.3 inherits the required initial 
point curve smoothness from the finite energy property of the homology theory we 
chosen. This allows us to construct a Bangert type homotopy in the Lagrangian case. 
In the generalized Morse lemma (Theorem 1.2), the smoothness of the homeomor-
phism <PI is usually two orders lower than that of the given functional II of (2). In our 
proof of Theorem 4.3, this map <PI is used to induce an isomorphism between finite 
energy homology modules. In order to do so, we need II to be e 3 so that <PI becomes 
a el-diffeomorphism and then a finite energy map defined in Section 2 below. This 
request then needs the Lagrangian function L to be e 3 and explains this smoothness 
requirement in our condition (L2). We have also carefully chosen the definition of 
the critical modules in (3.11) below, to make the corresponding deformation maps 
become finite energy maps. The reason for this definition is explained in Example 2.7. 
As preparations for our proof in Sections 4 and 5, in the following Section 2 we 
define finite energy homology and cohomology theory. In Section 3, we study critical 
modules and corresponding isomorphisms. 
14.1 
Critical module preparations 
In this section, for the reader's convenience, we list the results contained in other 
research papers or books which will be used in this chapter. Here we always let X 
be a Hilbert space with inner product (., .) and norm II . II, and use notation already 
introduced in Sections 4.1 and 13.1. 
The pseudo-gradient vector field is defined by Definition 1.3.1 on page 19 of [Cha6] 
and Remark A.17 on page 85 of [Rab7] as follows. Let U C X and IE el(U, R), 
Then v E Tu X is called a pseudo-gradient vector for I at u E U if there exist 
ex > fJ > 0 such that 
Ilvll ::s ex II I'(u) II , 
(f'(u), v) 0:: fJII/'(u) 112. 
(1) 

14.1 Critical module preparations 
293 
V : (U\K(f» -+ Tu X is a pseudo-gradient vector field for f on U, if V is locally 
Lipschitz continuous and V (u) is a pseudo-gradient vector for f at any u E U\K(f). 
The following deformation theorem is due to E. Rothe [Rotl], K.c. Chang [Cha6], 
and Z.Q. Wang [Wzql]. 
Theorem 1 Let fECI (X, R) satisfy the (PS)c condition for all c E [a, b] and let 
a be the only critical value of f in [a, b). Assume that the connected components of 
Ka (f) are only isolated points. Then fa is a strong deformation retract of fb \Kb (f). 
The Gromoll-Meyerpair was introduced by D. Gromoll and W. Meyer in [GrMl] of 
1969. Here we use Definition 1.5.1 on page 48 of [Cha6] for the Gromoll-Meyer pair 
as follows. Let f E C2(X, R) be a function satisfying the Palais-Smale condition. 
Suppose that V : (X\K(f» -+ T X is a pseudo-gradient vector field for f on X. Let 
p be an isolated critical point of f, c = f(p). A pair of topological spaces (W, W-) 
is called a Gromoll-Meyer pair with respect to V, if 
(i) W is a closed neighborhood of p possessing the mean value property, i.e., 
Vtl < t2, 17(ti) E w, i = 1,2, implies 17(t) E W for all t E [tl, t2], where 
17 (t) is a decreasing flow with respect to V. And there exists E > 0 such that 
W n fC-E = f-1[c - E) n K(f) = 0, W n K(f) = {p}; 
(ii) the set W- = {x E W 1 17(t, x) ~ W, Vt > O} is closed in W; 
(iii) W- is a piecewise submanifold, and the flow 17 is transversal to W-. 
The existence and properties of the Gromoll-Meyer pair can be found on pages 48 
to 50 in [Cha6]. 
The classical Morse lemma claims that a function at its non-degenerate critical 
point can be written into a quadratic function under a suitable coordinate system (cf. 
[Morl]). This result was generalized by D. Gromoll and W. Meyer to functionals at 
degenerate critical points in [GrMI] of 1969 for smooth functionals. Here we follow 
the description of this theorem in [GrMl] and Theorem 1.5.1 of [Cha6]. 
Theorem 2 Let U be an open subset of X, f E C3(U, R). Let x be the only critical 
point of f in U, and A = f" (x) with kernel N. Suppose that 0 is either an isolated 
point of the spectrum a(A) or not in a(A). Then there exist an open ball Br(O) in 
U centered at 0 with some radius r > 0, a local C2-dijJeomorphism ¢ from Br(O) 
to an open neighborhood ofx in X, and a map h E C2(Br(0) n N, N~) satisfying 
¢(O) = x and h(O) = 0 such that

X. Furthermore, ¢ has the form ¢(17) = x + 17 + h(17) for all 17 E Br(O) n Nand 
(¢-l)'(O) is the identity map. Thedegenerateparty E C3(UnN,R), the origin 
17 = 0 is an isolated critical point of y, and y (0) = f (x). The origin ~ = 0 is a

non-degenerate critical point 01 the quadratic function fJ satisfying fJ (0) = O. Let 
Q : X -+ Nand Q.l : X -+ N.l be the projectors respectively. By the implicit 
function theorem, the map h : U n N -+ N.l is uniquely defined by the equation 
(3) 
We follow the definition given in Sections 1.4 and 1.5 [Cha6]. Let 1 E C2(X, R). 
By Hq we denote the usual singular homology. 
Definition 3 For an isolated x E Kc(f), the q-th critical group of 1 at x with 
coefficient group Q is defined by 
Cq{f,x) = Hq{fc n u, (fc\{x}) n U; Q), 
(4) 
where U is any open neighborhood of x in M such that K{f) n (fc n U) = {x}. It 
is proved in [Cha6] that this definition is independent of the choice of U. 
Let (W, W-) be a Gromoll-Meyer pair of 1 at x. One can also define 
(5) 
Note that by Theorem 1.5.1 of [Cha6], the above two definitions coincide, i.e., 
Hq{fcnU, (fc\{x})nU; Q) is isomorphic to Hq(W, W-; Q) in the singular homology 
theory. 
Using the generalized Morse lemma, the following shifting theorem was proved 
by Gromoll-Meyer in [GrMI] (cf. also Theorem 1.5.4 of [Cha6]). 
Theorem 4 In the above generalized Morse Theorem 2, we suppose further that the 
Morse index 011 at its isolated critical point x is j. Then 
The following example can be found on page 33 of [Cha6]. 
Example 5 If x is an isolated local minimum of 1 E C2(X, R), then 
if 
q = 0, 
if 
q #= O.

In an n-dimensional manifold M, if x is an isolated local maximum of 1 E C (M, R), 
then

Let A be a bounded self-adjoint operator defined on the Hilbert space X. According

u E ~, u : llq ---+ X, 0 ::: q ::: p, there is assigned a map P(u) : llq x [0, 1] ---+ X

14.2 The finite energy homology theory 
In this section we introduce the finite energy homology and cohomology theories to 
gain certain smoothness of initial curves for singular simplexes in loop spaces. 
As usual, for any integer q ::: 0, let /).q denote the standard closed q-dimensional 
simplex in Rq and F~ denote its i-th face. For q ::: 0 and s E [0, 1] denote e(s) = 
(s, ... , s) E Rq. Then e = e(1/(q + 1)) is the barycenter of /).q. Denote by 
L the straight line passing through e(O) and e succesively in Rq. According to L, we 
obtain an orthogonal subspace decomposition 
Rq = Vq_, xL. 
(1) 
Thus any w E /).qcanbeuniquelywrittenasw = (v,t) E [Vq_, xL]n/).q. For such 
a w = (v, t) E /).q, denote by lev) the intersection segment of /).q with the straight 
line passing through w and parallel to L. This segment I (v) is well defined, since it 
is independent of the particular choice of the t -component of the point w = (v, t) on 
I(v). 
Definition 1 Let M be a Hilbert manifold. For any ljJ E C(/).q, M), we define the 
v-parametrized restriction curve #ljJv : lev, s) -+ M of ljJ for each w = (v, t) E 
[Vq-l X L] n /).q by 
# ljJv(s) = ljJ(v, s), 
v s E I(v). 
(2) 
Definition 2 Let k = 1 or 2. Suppose M is a C2-Hilbert manifold modeled on a 
Hilbert space X with the norm II . II. Let A be a subset of M. For q = 0, every 
singUlar simplex a E C(/).o, A) is defined to be a O-dimensional singular simplex 
with finite k-energy (k-FE O-simplex in A for short). Next we define higher dimen-
sional k-FE simplexes inductively. For any positive integer q, suppose m-dimensional 
k-FE singular simplexes have been defined for all 0 ::: m < q. A singular simplex 
a E C(/).q, A) is a q-dimensional singular simplex in A with finite k-energy (k-FE 
q-simplex in A for short) if every (q - I)-dimensional face a 0 F~ : /).q-l -+ A with 
o ::: i ::: q of a is a k-FE simplex, and there exists a real constant b(a) ::: 0 depending 
on a so that for any w = (v, t) E /).q it holds that #av E C(/(v), A) n Wl,k(/(v), A) 
and 
( II!!... # aves) Ilk ds ::: b(a). 
ll(v) ds 
(3) 
Note that all C'-smooth simplexes are k-FE simplexes for k = 1 and 2. For r > 0 
let a be a singular simplex from /).q to the loop space Er = W':2(Sr, Rn) with 
Sr = R/(rZ). For w = (v, t) E /).q, define the initial point curve a~m : lev) -+ R n 
of the restriction curve # a v : I (v) -+ E r by 
VSEl(v). 
(4) 

14.2 The finite energy homology theory 
297 
Then the most important property of FE simplexes in the loop space is given in the 
following lemma. 
Lemma 3 For r > 0 let a : I'1q --+ A C Wr be a k-FE singular simplex. Thenlor 
any w = (v, t) E I'1q, it holds that aJni E C(l(v), A) n WI,k(l(v), Rn) and 
[ 
l~aJni(S)lk ds :s Kkb(a), 
JZ(v) ds 
(5) 
where K > 0 is the Sobolev embbeding constant from the space Er to the space 
Cr = C(Sr, R2n). 
Proof: By definition we have aJni E C(l(v), R2n) and 
[ 
l~aJni(S)lk ds :s [

JZ(v)

Therefore a~ni E W1,k(l(v), Rn) and (5) holds. 
o 
Based on Definition 2, we can define new homology and cohomology theories for 
simplexes with finite energy as follows. 
Definition 4 Let k = 1 or 2. Given two C2-Hilbert manifolds Mi and their subsets 
Ai for i = 0, 1, a map I E C(Ao, Ad is a finite k-energy map (k-FE map for short) 
if for every k-FE q-simplex a in Ao, the composition map loa: 1'1 --+ Al is also a 
k-FE q-simplex in AI. 
Note that I is an k-FL-map if IE CI(Ao, Ad. 
Definition 5 Given C2-Hilbert manifolds Mi and subset Bi C Ai C Mi for i = 0, 1. 
Two k -FE maps I, g : (Ao, Bo) --+ (A I, B I) are k -FE homotopic, if there exists 
a k-FE map h : Ao x [0, 1] --+ Al such that h(·, 0) = 1(,), h(·, 1) = g(.), and 
h(·, s) : (Ao, Bo) --+ (AI, BI) for each s E [0, 1]. 
For k = 1 or 2, let A be the category consisting of the following objects and 
morphisms: 
(a) All subset pairs of any C2-Hilbert manifolds. 
(b) All k-FE maps between any two subset pairs of any two C2-Hilbert manifolds. 
Note that A is an admissible category in the sense of Eilenberg and Steenrod (cf. 
Section I.l of [EiSl]). For any coefficient ring T, using the usual argument as in 
Chapter VII of [EiSl], it is verified that, for the category A, singular homology and 
cohomology theories can be defined, and the axioms for homology and cohomology 

298 
14 Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
theories of Eilenberg and Steenrod (cf. [EiSl]) hold. We call them the k-finite 
energy singular homology and cohomology theories, denoted by H{e(A, B; g) and 
Hje (A, B; g) with coefficient ring 9 respectively. 
Note that based on definitions 1, 2, 4, and 5, the k-FE homology and cohomo-
logy theory can also be defined as the usual singular theory via the usual boundary 
operators. 
For k = lor 2, we say that a pair (A, B) of subsets B C A of a C2-Hilbert manifold 
M is k-finite, if for any E > 0, q :::: 0, and any usual singular q-cycle a = I:7=1 ai 
with ai : I::!.q -+ A, there exists a k-finite energy singular cycle a = I:7=1 ai with 
ai : I::!.q -+ A such that any subsimplex TJi of ai and the corresponding subsimplex 
Tli of ai satisfy 
(6) 
where p(., .) is the metric on C(l::!.q, M) induced from the metric on M, and any 
subsimplex TJi of ai satisfying Im(TJi) C B implies Im(~i) C B for the corresponding 
subsimplex ~i of ai. 
Theorem 6 For k = I or 2, let (A, B) be a k-finite pair of subsets of any C2 -Hilbert 
manifold with B C A. Then for any coefficient ring F, the usual singular homology 
H:g (A, B;:F) and cohomology H;g(A, B;:F) are isomorphic to the k-finite energy 
homology H{e(A, B; F) and cohomology Hje(A, B;:F) as modules respectively. 
Proof: Since every finite energy cycle is a usual singular cycle, Hte(A, B;:F) is 
a subgroup of H;g(A, B;:F). On the other hand, by the 2-finite assumption on 
(A, B), any singular cycle can be approximated by finite energy cycles preserving 
the pair (A, B). Thus every cycle in H;g (A, B; F) can be modified to a cycle in 
Hte(A, B;:F). Therefore H;g(A, B;:F) is a subgroup of Hte(A, B;:F). Thus the 
conclusion holds for 2-finite energy homology. Other cases can be proved similarly. 
D 
Since every q-dimensional singular simplex in Tn can be approximated by a 
q-dimensional smooth simplex, which is an FE-simplex, for Tn the FE homology 
and cohomology modules are isomorphic to the usual singular homology and coho-
mology modules. Especially, in the FE homology, we have H!e(Tn;:F) i=- ° 
with 
any non-trivial coefficient ring F. 
In Section 1, we have given two ways to define the critical modules. For our finite 
energy homology theory, we always use (1.5) of the critical modules via Gromoll-
Meyer pairs. The importance of using the Gromoll-Meyer pair in (1.5) of critical 
modules instead of (1.4) in our study here is that in the Gromoll-Meyer pair case 
we can avoid meeting curves with infinite energies, and avoid the strong deformation 
retractions in the proof to reach the critical point x. 
Note that even if ° 
i=- Cq (fy , x) when it is defined by (1.4) in terms of the usual 
singular homology theory, it may still hold that Cq (fy, x) = ° 
when it is defined by 
(1.4) in terms of the FE homology theory. 

14.2 The finite energy homology theory 
299 
Example 7 For r > 0, let Cr = {z E R211z1 = r} and Br(O) = {z E R211z1 < r}. 
We choose four smooth curves 1/1; : [0, +(0) --+ Bl (0) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 with no 
mutual intersections such that 1/11(0) = (0,1),1/12(0) = (1,0),1/13(0) = (0, -1), 
1/14(0) = (-1,0), 1/1; ([0, +(0» n Cr contains only one point for each r E (0, 1], 
1/1; (t) --+ 0 as t --+ +00 for all i, and 
"It:::: 0, i = 1,2,3,4. 
(7) 
Then we thicken each 1/1; to get its one open cone-shaped neighborhood W; with 
smooth boundaries so that all these four W;s have no mutual intersections, the inter-
section of each W; with Cr is path connected and possesses a finite length for any 
r E (0, 1], and the closure of U;=l W; covers BI (0). Note that the origin is still a limit 
point of each W;. 
These four infinitely long open cones can also be obtained in the following way. 
Denote by r; for i = 1,2, 3, and 4, the intersections of the four open quadrants in R2 
with B1 (0). Then we fix U;=l r; n C1 and spin their parts in B1 (0) around the origin 
at a variable speed, increasing to infinity as the point tends to the origin, to get four 
rotating open cones so that the closed disc B1 (0) is filled out by the closure of these 
four rotating cones, each of which has smooth boundaries, converges to the origin, and 
the original unit interval on each positive or negative axis becomes an infinitely long 
curve converging to the origin and satisfying (7). We denote the resulting rotating 
open cones by W; for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Now we choose a function f E C2(BI (0), R) so that 0 is the only critical point of 
f and 
I 
f(z) < 0, 
f(z) > 0, 
f(z) = 0, 
Vz E W1 U W3, 
Vz E W2 U W4, 
otherwise. 
(8) 
Denote the usual singular homology and our finite energy homologies by H sg 
and Hie respectively. Let U be any open neighborhood of 0 in Bl (0), and (W, W-) 
be a Gromoll-Meyer pair with respect to the gradient field f'. Let fo = {z E 
BI (0) I f(z) ::s OJ. Then by direct computation, we obtain that 
I 
H:gUo n u, Uo\{O}) n U; R) ~ R, 
H{eUo n U, UO \ {O}) n U; R) ~ 0, 
H:g(W, W-; R) ~ R, 
Hte(W, W-; R) ~ R. 
(9) 
This result indicates the differences between the usual singular homology and our 
finite energy homology, and between the definitions (1.4) and (1.5) for critical modu-
les. It shows that definition (1.5) is the right choice for FE homology to catch the 
useful information.

In the rest of this paper, for studies of the Lagrangian system (0.1) we use only 
the 2-finite energy theory and call it the finite energy (FE for short) homology and 
cohomology theory. In order to simplify the homology for product spaces, from now 
on we fix R to be the coefficient field for all the homology and cohomology modules 
in the rest of this paper. When there is no confusion, in this chapter we shall omit the 
super index Ie in the notations of finite energy homology modules.

Critical modules and isomorphisms 
In this and the next two sections, we give the proof of Theorem 0.2. Fix L satisfying 
(Ll) and (L2). For any TEN, let ST = R/(TZ) and E, = WI,2(S" Rn) with the 
usual inner product and the norm 
(x, y) = fo' (x· y + x . y)dt, 
IIxll = (x, x)I/2, 
V x, Y E ET. 
Define 
IT(X) = foT L(t, x, x)dt, 
V x E Er • 
(1) 
By the conditions (Ll) and (L2), it is well known that I, E C 3(E" R) satisfies 
the Palais-Smale condition and that critical points of IT correspond to contractible 
T -periodic solutions of (0.1) on Tn. Note that by the I-periodicity of the function H 
in (L2), the functional IT defined by (1) satisfies 
Im,(xm + j) = ml,(x), 
V x E E" j E Zn, T, mEN. 
(2) 
Let K(f,) be the critical point set of I, in E,. Then for any x E K(f,), the linearized 
system of (0.1) at x has the form 
where 
-(Py + Qy)" + QT y + Ry = 0, 
/
P(t) = Lx,x(t, x(t), x(t», 
Q(t) = Lx,x(t, x(t), x(t», 
R(t) = Lx,xCt, x(t), x(t». 
(3) 
(4) 
Note that in this case, P and R E C (S" .c(R n» are symmetric, P is positive definite, 
and Q E C(S" .c(Rn». The system (3) corresponds to the Hessian of I, at x 
given by 
U;'(x)y, z) = la' {(Fy + Qy) . z + QT y. Z + Ry . z}dt,

Then the linear system (3) is equivalent to the linear Hamiltonian system 
y = J B(t)y, 
(7) 
Through the fundamental solution Yx of this system (7) with Yx (0) = 1, the iterated 
index of (x, x) is defined by 
(i(x, m), vex, m)) = (iJ (Yxm), VI (y;)), 
V mEN. 
(8) 
By Theorem 7.3.1, the Morse index m - (x) and the nullity mO(x) of the functional 
ir at x coincide with the corresponding index defined in Chapter 5, i.e., 
m-(x) = i(x , 1), 
mO(x) = vex, 1). 
(9) 
Note that by Theorem 10.1.2, 
max{O, mi(x, 1) - n} :::: i(x, m) 
:::: mi(x, 1) +n - v(x , m), 
V mEN. 
(10) 
Let x E Er be an isolated critical point of ir in the rest of this section. As 
mentioned at the end of Section 2, following definition (1.5), we define the critical 
module Cq (fr, x) of ir at its critical point x via the FE-singular homology by 
(11) 
where (W (x), W- (x)) is a Gromoll-Meyer pair defined in Section 1 following 
[GrMl] and [Cha6] via some pseudo-gradient vector field of ir near x defined follow-
ing [Rab7]. Note that the critical module Cq (fr, x) is independent of the choice of the 
Gromoll-Meyer pair and the pseudo-gradient vector field in the definition as proved 
in [GrMl] and [Cha6]. According to the null, negative, and positive definiteness of 
the quadratic form i:'(x), the space Er possesses an orthogonal decomposition 
Using the generalized Morse lemma mentioned in Section 1 following [GrMl] and 
[Cha6], there exist a diffeomorphism <Pr which maps some open neighborhood Vr of 
o in Er to <Pr(Ur) C Er with <Pr(O) = x, and a map hr E C2(Vr n MO(x), M.l(x))

Lemma 2 The iteration map Y,m : M*(x) -+ M*(xm)for * = 0, -, and + is linear, 
continuous, and injective. Moreover, ifv(x, m) = v(x, 1), the map Y,m : MO(x) -+ 
MO(xm) is a linear diffeomorphism. 1fi(x, m) = i(x, 1), the map Y,m : M-(x) -+ 
M- (xm) is a linear diffeomorphism. 
Proof: This follows from the definition of Y,m .

14.3 Critical modules and isomorphisms 
303 
For the functionals fr and fmr we have the following results. 
Lemma 3 Using notation of the generalized Morse lemma, suppose for some mEN 
that vex, m) = vex, 1). 
1° Themaphmr E C2(Umr nM(xm), Ml.(xm))dejinedinthegeneralizedMorse 
lemma further satisfy 
2° It holds that 
(21) 
Here we require Umr n 1jJm(Er) = 1jJm(Ur). 
Proof: 1 ° By Lemma 2, the map 1jJm : MO (x) ~ MO (xm) is a linear diffeomor-
phism. Thus every element in MO(xm) is of the form 1jJm(1]) for some 1] E 
MO(x). Thus for any 1] E Ur n MO(x), 
1jJm[f;(x + 1] + hr(1]))] = f~r(xm + 1jJm(1]) + 1/fm 0 hr(1])). 
Denote by pjzr : Emr ~ MO(xm) the projection map. Thus 
This is equation (1.3) in the generalized Morse lemma for fmr which uniquely 
definesthemaphmr : UmrnMo(xm) ~ Ml.(xm). Therefore (20) must hold. 
2° Note that both sides of (21) are solutions of the equation 
p!rf~r(a) = 0, 
where p!r is the projection map from Emr to the orthogonal complement of 
1jJm(Er) in Emr . Thus 2° follows by an argument similar to that of 1 0 . 
o 
Corollary 4 For 1] E Ur n MO(x), ~ E Ur n Ml.(x), and mEN, 
(22) 
and <Pmr induces an isomorphism on critical modules 
(23) 
For any mEN and 1] E MO(xm) near the origin, using the generalized Morse 
lemma we define 
Vm(1]) = ~1jJm 0 (1jJm)* 0 Y~r(1]). 
m 
Then Vm is a pseudo-gradient vector field of Ymr near the origin.

Proposition 5 Suppose vex, m) = vex, 1). 
1 ° It holds that 
(24) 
2° Fork, mEN, let (Uyh , U».) bea GromoU-MeyerpairofYkr: atO in MO(xk) 
defined by the negativejiow ofVk. Then (l/fm(UYkr)' l/fm(U»'r)) is a Gromoll-
Meyer pair of Ymkr: at O. 
3° Further suppose i(x, m) = i(x, 1). Then l/fm induces an isomorphism on FE 
homology modules 
(25) 
Proof: By the assumption v(x, m) = v(x, 1), the map l/fm is a linear homeomorphism 
from MO(x) to MO(xm). From Corollary 4, we obtain 
(l/fm)*Y~kr:(l/fm(TJ)) = mY£r:(TJ) 
VTJ E Uykr , 
"1m, kEN. 
Then for any TJ E U Ykr ' 
Thus 1° follows. Therefore we obtain that (l/fm(uykr ), l/fm(uYkr )-) is a Gromoll-
Meyer pair of Ymkr: at the origin. Other claims of 2° in the definition of the Gromoll-
Meyer pair in Section 1 can be proved similarly. 3° follows from 1 ° - 2° and Lemma 2. o 
Since both f3r: and f3mr: are non-degenerate quadratic forms, by a proof similar to 
that of Theorem 1.4.1 on pages 34 to 35 of [Cha6] we obtain 
Proposition 6 Suppose i(x, m) = i(x, 1). Then the iteration map l/fm induces an 
isomorphism on FE homology modules 
if q = i(x, 1), 
if q i= i(x, 1). 
(26) 
Now we are ready to study the homomorphisms among the critical modules induced 
by the iteration map l/fm. 
Theorem 7 Let x : Sr: --+ R n be an isolated r -periodic solution of (0.1) for some 
r E N with c = fr:(x). Suppose that for some mEN, as an mr-periodic solution 
of (0.1), its iteration xm is isolated, and that 
i(x, m) = i(x, 1) 
and 
vex, m) = vex, 1). 
(27) 
Thenfor every q E Z, the iteration map l/fm : Er: --+ Emr: induces an isomorphism 
(28) 

14.4 Global homological injectivity 
305 
Here we also note that 1/1:' maps generators to generators in (28). Moreover if similar 
conditions also holdfor k and mk E N, then 
Proof: Consider the diagram 
Cq(fr, x) 
1 
(<1>;1). 
Cq(Yr + {Jr, 0) 
(29) 
(30) 
By Lemma 3 this diagram is commutative and the iteration map on the top line induces 
a homomorphism on critical modules. By the shifting Theorem 1.4 with its proofs in 
[GrMl] and page 51 of [Cha6], and our above Propositions 5 and 6, the iteration map 
on the bottom line of (30) induces an isomorphism. By Corollary 4, both <Pr and <Pmr 
induce isomorphisms. Thus the conclusion holds. In this proof, we always keep the 
Gromoll-Meyer pair (UYmr' U:;"') of Ymr at the origin to be defined by the negative 
flow of Vm for which Proposition 5 is applicable. The proof is complete. 
0 
Remark 8 As mentioned in Section 1, we need the C3 smoothness of L by (L2) to 
guarantee the map <Pr in (13) of the generalized Morse lemma to be a C l map, and 
thus it is an FE map and induces an isomorphism on FE homology modules. 
14.4 Global homological injectivity 
In this section we fix a Lagrangian function L satisfying (Ll) and (L2). For any 
kEN, our proof from the following (2) to (4) shows that the critical point set K(fk) 
of fk on Ek is non-empty if it is at most finite, and thus must be non-empty. Next 
we prove Theorem 0.2 indirectly in Sections 4 and 5 by supposing the following 
assumption: 
(LF) The system (0.1) possesses only finitely many Tn-distinct solution towers 
based on contractible integer periodic solutions in Rn. 
Therefore under (LF) we can assume that there exist positive integers T and p 
such that (0.1) possesses only finitely many zn -translation independent T -periodic 
solutions {Xl, ... ,Xp} on R n and all the other mT-periodic solutions of (0.1) on R n 
for mEN are Zn-translations of iterations of these Xk, i.e., the critical point set 
K(fmr) of fmr in Emr has the form 
(1) 
and the critical value set f mr (K(f mr )) C R is a finite non-empty set. 

306 
14 
Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
Note that Emr: possesses an orthogonal decomposition 
with W mr: formed by functions in Emr: possessing zero mean value. Using K.c. Chang's 
Theorem 1.6 and our (3.2), we obtain that there exist two real numbers Cm < dm 
depending on Imr: such that 
cm < Imr:(x) < dm, 
V x E K(fmr:), 
and the following isomorphisms hold: 
(2) 
Hn«lmr:)dm, (fmr:)cm) ~ Hn(Emr:, (fmr:)cm) ~ Hn(r) =1= 0, 
(3) 
where (fmr:)c == {z E Emr: I Imr: (z) ~ c}. By the isolatedness of points in K(fmr:), 
J.Q. Liu's Theorem 1.7 yields that at least one critical point x of Imr: satisfies 
(4) 
Together with Example 1.5, this critical point x must be a non-minimal saddle point. 
From (4) and the shifting Theorem 1.4, we then obtain immediately the following 
result. 
Lemma 1 By the assumption (LF), lor every mEN, there exists an m r -periodic 
solution Ym 01 the system (0.1) such that 
Next we consider the homological injectivity of the homomorphism induced by 
the iteration map 1/Im under the assumption (LF). 
By (LF) and (3.2), if necessary replacing the Lagrangian function L by L + b with 
a large enough constant b > 0, we always assume in the following that there exists a 
constant Ao > 0 such that for every mEN and every critical point x of 1m r: in Em r: , 
Imr:(x) ::: Ao > O. 
(6) 
Lemma 2 Suppose (LF) holds. Then there exists a constant A I ::: Ao such that lor 
every mEN and every mr-periodic solution x 01(0.1), 
Cn+l(fmr:, x) = 0, 
whenever 
Imr:(x) > AI· 
(7) 
Proof: By (LF) we obtain (1). Note that xl:' + j = (Xk + j)m. By the shifting 
Theorem 1.4 and the generalized Morse Theorem 1.2, (3.2), Corollary 3.4, and the 
Kiinneth formula (cf. [Spal]), we obtain 
Cn+l-imr(Xt) (Ymr:, 0) ® Cimr (xkl({3mr:, 0) 
Cn+l-imr(xk")(Ymr:, 0) ® R 
Cn+l-imr(xkl(Ymr:,O). 
(8) 

14.4 Global homological injectivity 
307 
Note that ° :s Vmr (x: + j) :s 2n always holds. If i (Xk, 1) > 0, then for sufficiently 
large mEN, the right-hand side of (8) must be killed because of the iteration 
Theorem 10.1.2. If i (Xk, 1) = 0, then for any mEN, the right-hand side of (8) is 
still killed because of the iteration Theorem 10.1.2. This proves the lemma. 
D 
By (LF), (3.2), and Lemma 1, we obtain an infinite subsequence Q of {2m 1m E 
{OJ UN}, some kEN and an x in {Xl, ... , X p} such that for every m E Q it holds that 
CnUkr, xk) =1= 0, i(x, mk) = i(x, k), and vex, mk) = vex , k). To simplify notation, 
without loss of generality, from now on we rename kr by r and suppose 1 E Q, 
X E {Xl, .. . ,xp }, and for any m E Q, 
{ CnUr,X) =1=0, 
i(x, m) = i(x, 1), 
veX, m) = vex, 1). 
Thus by Theorem 3.7, the iteration map 1jJm induces isomorphisms 
"1m E Q. 
(9) 
Let c = fr(x). By (1), KUmr)) contains only finitely many points. By (3.2), the 
deformation Theorem 1.1, where we also refer to the idea of the proof of 
Theorem I.4.2 on pages 35 to 36 of [Cha6], there exists a sufficiently small E > ° 
independent of mEN such that for all mEN 
fmr(KUmr)) n [m(c - 3E), m(c + 3E)] = {me}, 
and the inclusion map 
(10) 
induces a monomorphism on homology modules 
where BO denotes the interior of B. 
If Hn+I(Emr , (fmr)m(c+2E» ) =1= 0, using (LF) and J.Q. Liu's Theorem 1.7 as 
in the above discussions, we would obtain a critical point z of fmr such that 
Cn+ 1 U mr, z) =1= 
0. When m is sufficiently large, this violates Lemma 2. Thus 
there exists mo > ° 
such that 
(12) 
Here and in the rest of this chapter we denote Q(k) = {m E Q 1m c::: k}. Then the 
exact sequence of FE homology modules for the triple 

308

Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
shows that the inclusion map 
induces a monomorphism on homology modules 
Summarizing our discussion now, we obtain 
Theorem 3 Suppose conditions (U) and (L2) and the assumption (LF) hold. Then 
there exist a r-periodic solution of (0. 1) with r EN, an integer mo > 0, an infinite 
integer set Q containing 1, and a small E > 0 such that, for 1mr = h3 0 h2 0 h, with 
h, to h3 defined by (10) and (13) and all mE Q(mo) = {k E Q I k ::: mol, we obtain 
the diagram 
(15) 
where 1/1': is an isomorphism, and (jmr)* is a monomorphism among the FE homology 
modules. Especially let [a] be a generator of Cn (fr , x). Then going through the 
diagram (15), 
in Hm. 
(16) 
14.5 Global homological vanishing 
In this section we give a Lagrangian system version ofY. Bangert's global deformation 
method introduced in [BanI] for closed geodesics, and construct global homotopies 
as in the proofs of Theorems 1 to 3 of [BaKl] to show that the left-hand side of (4.16) 
must vanish in Hm for all large enough m E Q. Then this yields a contradiction to 
Theorem 4.3 and proves our Theorem 0.2. We carry out the details of this proof in 
three steps. 
Step 1 For a given topological space V, let aj : [aj, bi] ~ V, for i = 1 and 2, be 
two paths defined on bounded intervals with b, = a2 and a, (b,) = a2(a2). As usual 
we define new paths aI' : [a" bll ~ V and a2 * al : [a" b2] ~ V by 
for a, :5 s :5 bl, 
for a2 :5 s :5 b2. 
Proposition 1 For r E N, c E R, E > 0, and q ::: 0, let

be an FE q -simplex. Then there exists an integer m (T) > 0 such that for every integer 
m :::: m(T), the q-simplex 
(2) 
is FE homotopic to an FE singular q-simplex T)m satisfying 
(3) 
(4) 
and the homotopy fixes T)m la~q' 
Proof: We carry out the proof in two steps. 
(A) The definition ofa new path am : [a, b] -+ Emr with am(a) = 1jIm(a(a» and 
am (b) = 1jIm (a(b» for a given FE-path a : [a, b] -+ Er . 
Fix the integer m :::: 3. Define the initial point curve fJa of a by 
fJa(t) = a(t)(O) , 
for a :s t :s b. 
For 0 :s s :s (b - a)/m and I :s k :s m - 2, following [BanI] we define 
am(a + s) = (fJa I[a,a+msj)-l * a(a + ms) * (fJa I[a ,a+msj) * a(a)m-l, 
am (a + k(b - a) / m + s) = (fJa)-1 * a(b)k * (fJal[a+ms ,bj) 
*a(a + ms) * (fJa I[a,a+msj) * a(a)m- k-I , 
am(b - (b - a)/m + s) = (fJal[a+ms,b])-1 * a(b)m-l 
*(fJal[a+ms,bj) * a(a + ms). 
(5) 
For each r E [a, b], we reparametrize the loop am(r) as follows: in the above 
formula, each fixed part a(a) or a(b) spends the original time c, the moving part 
a (a + ms) and the pieces of the initial point curve fJa share the time c proportionally 
to their original parametrizations. This defines a new path am : [a, b] -+ Emr with 
am(a) = 1jIm(a(a» = a(a)m and am (b) = 1jIm(a(b» = a(b)m. 
Let fJa ,m : [a , b] -+ Er be the path defined via replacing all the terms of powers 
of a(a) and a(b) by the identity matrix in the formula (5) of am. Let 
I 
Mo(a) = maxUr(a(a», f,(a(b))}, 
MI(a) = maxa <s<b Ifr(a(s»l, 
M2(a) = J: IF(fJ~)(t»ldt,

where 
for t belonging to the domain of f3a. Clearly Mo(a) and Ml (a) are finite real numbers. 
Since a is an FE path in the loop space Er , by Lemma 2.3 and the continuity of a we 
obtain M2(a) is also finite and depends only on a. 
Then by direct computations for aSs S band k = [m(s - a) / (b - a)], we obtain

(B) The definition of a new FE simplex 17m : t::..q --+ Er and the homotopy from 17m 
to 17m for the given 17. 
As in Section 3, for q 2: 0 and t, s E [0,1] denote e(t, s) = (t, ... , t, s) E Rq x 
[0,1]. Then the pointe(s) = e(I/(q+l), s) is the barycenterof t::..q x {s} c Rq x {s}. 
Define 
t::..q(s) = e((l - s)/(q + 1), s) + st::..q C t::..q, 
for 0 S s S 1. 
Denote by L(s) the straight line passing through e(O, s) and e(s) successively in 
Rq x {s}. According to L(s), we obtain a new orthogonal subspace decomposition 
of Rq x {s} as Vq-l,s x L(s). Thus any W E t::..q x {s} can be uniquely written as 
W = (v, t) E Vq-l,s x L(s). For such a W = (v, t) E t::..q(s), denote by I(v, s) the 
intersection segment of t::..q (s) with the straight line passing through w and parallel 
to L(s). This segment I(v, s) is well defined, since it is independent of the particular 
choice of the t -component in w = (v, t) E t::..q (s). 
For any s E [0, 1] and ¢ : t::..q (s) --+ Er, similar to (2.2) we define a v-parametrized 
curve #¢v : I(v, s) --+ Er for each w = (v, t) E [Vq-l,s x L(s)] n t::..q(s) by 
# ¢v(t) = ¢(v, t), 
V t E I(v, s). 
(9) 
Now for the given FE simplex map I] : (t::..q, at::..q) --+ (Er, (fr)~_f),itsm-thiteration 
is given by I]m : (t::..q, at::..q) --+ (Emr , (fmr)':n(c-f)' Since I] is an FE q-simplex in 
the loop space Er , by Lemma 2.3 we can apply the above Step A to the initial value 
curve I]~ni : 1 (v, s) --+ R 2n of each # I]v : I (v, s) --+ Er. Thus using (9) we can define

where (v, t) is the unique Vq-I,l x L(I) decomposition of (w, 1) E ~q(1) = Iq x {I}. 
For any (w, s) E ~q x [0,1], writing (w, s) = (v, t, s) E [Vq-l,s x L(s)] x [0,1], 
since IJ is FE, using Lemma 2.3 we define 
if (w, s) E (~q x {s})\~q(s), 
if (w, s) = (v, t, s) E ~q(s). 
(11) 
Then by this definition, h is an FE continuous map, and satisfies h (., 0) = IJm, 
h(·, 1) = IJm, and hew, s) = IJm(w) whenever w E a~q and 0 S s S 1. Thus h is 
an FE-homotopy from IJm to IJm which fixes rr lall.q . The proof is complete.

Step 2 For any FE singular cycle a, let L (a) be the set of all simplexes together 
with all their faces contained in the singular chain a. Then L (a) is a finite set. 
Proposition 2 Suppose L satisfies (Ll) and (L2). Suppose (4.15) holds via the 
composition (jmr)* 0 1/f': of the homomorphism (jmr)* and the isomorphism 1/f': for 
some i-periodic solution x of(O.I) on R n with i E N obtained via (4.3) to (4.4), all 
m ::: m 1 with some integer m 1 > 0, and some E > O. Let a E en (fr, x) be any FE 
singular chain which is mapped into Jim in (4.15) for all m ::: m I. Then there exists 
a sufficiently large integer mea) ::: m 1 such thatfor every integer m E Q(m(a)) and 
for every f-L E L(a) with f-L : ~r ---+ Er and 0 S r S n, there exists a homotopy 
p(f-Lm) : ~r X [0, 1] ---+ Emr,! such that the properties (i) to (iv) in Bangert and 
Klingenberg's Theorem 1.8 holdfor (X, A) = (Emr , (fmr)~(C_E))' 
Proof: For any integer p ::: 0, define Lp(a) = {f-L E L(a) I dimf-L S pl. By 
induction on p we will determine the integer mea) and construct the mentioned 
homotopy p(f-Lm) for mE Q(m(a» and each f-L E Lp(a). 
When p = 0, by our discussion following (4.4), xm in (4.15) as a critical point of 
fmr is anon-minimum saddle point. Thus we can connect every f-L E Lo(a) to a point 
in (fmr )~(C-E) by smooth paths in Emr . Using such paths the homotopy p(f-Lm) can 
be defined for all m ::: m I. We set mo(a) = mI. 
When p ::: 1, by induction, there exists an integer m p_1 (a) ::: 1 such that the 
homotopy p(f-Lm) satisfying the properties (i) to (iv) in Theorem 1.8 is defined for 
every m E Q(mp_l(a)) and every f-L E Lp_l(a). By reparametrization we may 
further assume 
p(f-Lm)(., s) = p(f-Lm) (. ~) ,

the homotopy extension ofthe map R~'iL such that Rq,iLC, 0) = jLq. Then 
Rq,iL(" 1/2) : (t:.p, at:.p) ---+ (Eqr , (fqT)~(C-E))'

14 Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
By Proposition 1, there exists a sufficiently large integer mp(JL) E Q(q) for the 
above fixed JL such that for every integer k E Q(mp(JL)) there exists a homotopy 
Fk : t::.p x [i, 1] --+ Ekqr with Fsk = hk(., s) for s E [i, 1] such that

Ff = (Rq,/L(-. l)h : t::.p --+ (fqrk)~k(c-E)' 
Since ~p(a) is a finite set, let mp(a) = max{mp(JL)21 JL E ~p(a)}. Then for 
every m E Q (m p (a)), we define the homotopy functor P (JL m) for every JL E ~ p (a) 
as follows: 
1° IfdimJL < p,thenQ(mp(JL)) C Q(mp-l(JL)) and p(JLm) is already defined. 
2° If dimJL = p and JL(t::. p) C 
(fr)~-E' define p(JLm)(·,s) = JLmO for 
OSss1. 
3° If dimJL = p and JL(t::. p) rt. (fr)~-E' by the induction assumption, and the 
definition of m E Q(mp(a)), there exists a unique integer kEN such that 
m = kmp-l (a). Then k ~ mp(JL) by the definition of mp(a). We define 
Os s s i, 
isssl. 
Now one can verify that the map p(JLm) satisfies the properties (i) to (iv) of 
Theorem 1.8. 
By the finiteness of the set ~(a) and induction on p, we can define m(a) == 
mn(a). Then by induction, the homotopy p(JLm) is defined for all JL E ~(a) and 
m E Q(mn(a)) and possesses properties (i) to (iv) in Theorem 1.8 as claimed. This 
completes the proof. 
0 
Step 3 Now we can give 
Proof of Theorem 0.2: Suppose the Lagrangian function L satisfies the conditions 
(Ll) and (L2), and the assumption (LF) holds. We obtain a <-periodic solution x of 
(0.1) on R n for some < EN, mo > 0, a small E > 0, and a singular cycle [a] =1= 0 
in Cn(fr, x) such that (4.15) and (4.16) in Theorem 4.3 hold for all m E Q(mo). 
But on the other hand, we can take a sufficiently great integer m(a) ~ mo such 
that Proposition 2 holds for all m E Q(m(a)). Thus by Proposition 2, the same 
homomorphism in (4.16) sends [a] to the zero element of the module 1tm in (4.15) 
for all m E Q(m(a)). This contradicts (4.16), and then (LF) can not hold. The proof 
is complete.

14.6 Notes and comments 
The study of integer periodic solutions of the system (0.1) under the conditions (Ll) 
and (L2) possesses a very long history. The most standard model is the multiple 
pendulum type system with periodic forcing terms (cf. [CLZl]). We refer to [Rab2] 
and [FoWl] for further references. Note that in Theorems 1 and 2 we have no non-
degeneracy restriction on any solutions of (1). This is rather different from the known 
results for Lagrangian system (1) as mentioned in [FoWl]. 
Our Theorem 0.1 can be viewed as a confirming answer to the Lagrangian system 
analogue of C. Conley's conjecture on periodic points of Hamiltonian maps mentioned 
on pages 1304 to 1305 of [SaZ2]: 
C. Conley's conjecture: 
On the torus T2n with standard symplectic form, any 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism (i.e., the time I-map defined by the flow of some 
I-periodic Hamiltonian system) possesses infinitely many periodic points which are 
produced by contractible I-periodic solutions of that Hamiltonian system. 
So far this conjecture is still open. Partial results on this conjecture can be found in 
[CoZ3], [CoZ4], [LZeI], [SaZl], and [SaZ2]. Among them the following significant 
progress was made by D. Salamon and E. Zehnder in [SaZ2] of 1992: 
Theorem 1 (Theorem A of [SaZ2]). Suppose the symplectic form wand the first 
Chern class C) vanish on Jr2(M) ofa compact symplectic manifold (M, w). Then any 
Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on (M, w) possesses infinitely many periodic points 
which are produced by contractible I-periodic solutions of that Hamiltonian system, 
provided every contractible Hamiltonian solution has at least one Floquet multiplier 
not equal to 1. 
Here I would also like to remind readers of the following related conjecture of 
H. Hofer and E. Zehnder proposed on Page 263 of their celebrated book [HoZ3] in 
1994: Every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on a compact symplectic manifold (M, w) 
possessing more fixed points than necessarily required by the V. Arnold conjecture 
possesses always infinitely many periodic points. 
Note that the famous V. Arnold conjecture claims that the number offixed points 
of every Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on a compact symplectic manifold (M, w) is at 
least cuplength(M) + 1. This number is at least the Betti number of M, provided all 
the fixed points are non-degenerate. 
In 1978, Y. Eliashberg proved this conjecture for Riemannian surfaces. In 1983, 
C. Conley and E. Zehnder proved the Arnold conjecture for T2n in their celebrated 
paper [CoZl]. After that, a great number of research works have been published on 
this conjecture, including the great contributions [Grol] ofM. Gromov and [Flo2] of 
A. Floer. Other contributions can be found in [ForI], [Hof3], [HoSl], [Marl], [RuTl]. 
For more details on these contributions we refer to the excellent books [HoZ3] of

14 Periodic Lagrangian orbits on tori 
H. Hofer andE. Zehnder in 1994, [McSl] and [McS2] ofD. McDuffandD. Salamon 
in 1994, 1996, and 1998. Note that in the recent celebrated research works [FuOl] 
of K. Fukaya and K. Ono, [LiTI] of G. Liu and G. Tian, [Rua2] of Y. Ruan, the non-
degenerate Arnold conjecture was completely proved. But the degenerate Arnold 
conjecture is still open for general compact symplectic manifolds. Further results 
on this degenerate conjecture can be found in [LeOl], [Sch2] and the references 
therein. 

Chapter 15 
Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
Let I; be a C2 -compact hypersurface in R 2n, bounding a strictly convex compact set 
C with non-empty interior, and with a non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. Without 
loss of generality, we assume ° 
E C. We denote the set of all such hypersurfaces 
in R2n by H(2n). We denote by Hs(2n) the set of elements in H(2n) which are 
symmetric with respect to the origin, i.e., x E I; implies -x E I;. 
For x E I;, let NE(X) be the outward unit normal vector at x of L We consider 
the dynamics problem of finding i > ° 
and a C1 curve x: [0, i] -+ R2n such that 
{ x(t) = J NE(X(t)), 
XCi) = X(O), 
x(t) E I;, 
"It E R, 
(1) 
where J is the standard symplectic matrix on R 2n given in Section 1.1. A solution 
(i, x) of the problem (1) is called a closed characteristic on I;. Two closed charac-
teristics (i, x) and (a, y) are geometrically distinct, if x(R) =1= y(R). We denote 
by J (I;) and j (I;) the set of all closed characteristics (i, x) on I; with i being 
the minimal period of x and the set of all geometrically distinct ones respectively. 
For (i, x) E J(I;), we denote by [(r, x)] the set of all elements in J(I;) which are 
geometrically the same as (i, x). # A denotes the total number of elements in a set A. 
To cast the given energy problem (1) into a Hamiltonian version, we follow 
Section Y.3 of I. Ekeland's celebrated book [Eke3]. Fix a I; E H(2n) bounding 
a convex set C. Then the origin is in the interior of C. Let h : R2n -+ [0, +00) be 
the gauge function of I; defined by 
{ hex) = infrA > 01 IE c}, 
h(O) = 0. 
for 
x =1= 0, 
(2) 
Fix a constant ex satisfying 1 < ex < 2 in this chapter. As usual we define the 
Hamiltonian function Ha : R2n -+ [0, +00) by 
"Ix E R2n. 
(3) 
Then Ha E c1(R2n, R)nC2(R2n\{0}, R) is convex and I; = H;l (1). The problem 
(1) is equivalent to the following given energy problem of the Hamiltonian system: 
x(t) = J H~(x(t)), 
"It E R,

x(r) = x(O),

Ha(x(t)) = 1,

Denote by .:7 C'.f" ex) the set of all solutions (r, x) of the problem (4)-(6) where r is 
the minimal period of x. Note that elements in .:7('.£.) and .:7('.£., ex) are in one to one 
correspondence with each other. 
Let (r, x) E .:7('.£., ex). We call the fundamental solution Yx : [0, r] -+ Sp(2n) 
with Yx (0) = 1 of the linearized Hamiltonian system 
yet) = J H;(x(t))y(t), 
Vt E R, 
(7) 
the associated symplectic path of (r, x). The eigenvalues of Yx (r) are called Floquet 
multipliers of (r, x). By Proposition 1.6.13 of [Eke3], the Floquet multipliers with 
their multiplicity and Krein type numbers of (r, x) E .:7('.£.) do not depend on the 
particular choice of the Hamiltonian function in (4). As usual a (r, x) E .:7('.£.) is 
elliptic, hyperbolic, or non-degenerate, if so is Yx (r) as in Definitions 1.8.1 and 
5.0.1 with w = 1. It is well known that these concepts are independent of the choice 
of ex> 1. 
Note that (r, x) E .:7('.£., ex) is called linearly stable, if there exists a constant 
b > 0 such that 
IIMm 1I.C(R2n-2) :s b, 
Vm EN, 
for any M given by the decomposition (2.2.2) below of Yx (r). By this definition, that 
(r, x) E .:7(z., ex) is linearly stable implies that it is elliptic. 
In this chapter we study the existence, multiplicity, and stability of closed char-
acteristics on any '.£. E H(2n). The main results of this chapter are Theorems C 
and D on the existence and mUltiplicity, and the stability given in the Introduction of 
this book. 
Note that a typical example of '.£. E Hs (2n) is the ellipsoid En (r) defined as follows. 
Let r = (r1, ... , rn) with rk > 0 for 1 :s k :s n. Define 
(8) 
If rj/rk is irrational whenever j i= k, this En(r) is called a weakly non-resonant 
ellipsoid. In this case, the corresponding Hamiltonian system is linear, and all the 
solutions can be computed explicitly. Thus it is easy to verify that # j(En(r)) = n, 
that all the closed characteristics on En (r) are elliptic and non-degenerate, and that 
all of them have irrational mean indices greater than 2 (cf. §I.7 of [Eke3]). 
For the reader's convenience, next we briefly describe the main ideas in the proofs 
of the main results in this section, i.e., Theorems C and D in the Introduction of this 
book. 
A Ideas of the proof of the multiplicity results 
(0.0.16)-(0.0.18) in Theorem C 
Fix a '.£. E H(2n). Our study is carried out in the following four steps. 

15.0 Closed characteristics on convex hypersuifaces 
317 
(1) Using the gauge function h:,(x) of I:, the problem of finding closed char-
acteristics on I: is transformed to the above given energy problem (4)-(6) with 
Hamiltonian function Ha for some a E (1,2). Then this given energy problem 
is further transformed to a given period problem (2.1) below of finding I-periodic 
solutions of the Hamiltonian system (4). By the dual action principle of F. Clarke 
and I. Ekeland (cf. Section Y.3 of [Eke3]), solutions of the I-periodic boundary value 
problem correspond to critical points of the dual action functional fa : Ea ---+ R 
defined by (2.3) below, and fa possesses an increasing infinite sequence of negative 
critical values {Ck} with Ck ---+ 0 as k ---+ +00. These Ck are obtained by the Fadell-
Rabinowitz Sl-cohomological index method as in Section Y.3 of [Eke3]. Note that 
here each infinite variationally visible (see Definition 3.3 below) [(r, x)] E leI:) 
and all of its iterations {xm} yield a strictly increasing infinite subsequence of {Ck}, 
and the corresponding critical points of fa are given by {U~}mEN of (2.10) below. 
Denote the index interval of the m-th iteration of (r, x) by 
Im(r, x) = [i(x, m), i(x, m) + vex, m) -
1]. 
An important result of I. Ekeland and H. Hofer (cf. [EkH2]) is that for every kEN, 
there exists a [(r, x)] E leI:) and an mEN such that 
2k - 2 + n E Im (r, x). 
Especially this implies 
2N - 2 + n C 
U U Im (r, x). 
l(r,x)lEJ(~) mEN 
(9) 
(10) 
(11) 
Thus instead of studying # leI:) from corresponding subsequences in the whole 
sequence {Ck}, we study how their index interval sequences cover the set 2N - 2 + n. 
(2) Suppose leI:) < +00 and denote 
.l(I:) = {[(rj, Xj)] I j = 1, ... , q}. 
(12) 
The precise iteration formulae established in Chapter 8 allow us to classify the iter-
ated index sequences into 8 different iteration patterns as in [LonI8] for symplectic 
paths in Sp(4) as fundamental solutions of closed characteristics on I: when n = 2. 
Indices of iterations of paths in Sp(6) are also classified and studied similarly. The 
most important phenomenon we observed in these studies is that there are infinitely 
many chances of iteration times m 1, ... , m p and subsets £ of 2N - 2 + n such that 
U)=lIm/rj, Xj) covers £ and # £ yields a lower bound for the number of symplectic 
paths under study. 
In order to effectively catch the set £s, we enlarge the closed index interval 
Im+l (r, x) to a bigger open interval 
Qm(r, x) = (i(x, m) + vex, m) - 1, i(x, m + 2)), 

318 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
which we call the index jump of the m-th iteration of (T, x). Here by our study of 
iterated indices, the closed index interval Im (T, x) of (T, x) are mutually disjoint and 
strictly increasing (cf. Lemma 3.2 below). Thus 
(13) 
Ij(T, x) n Qm(T, x) = 0, 
Vj i= m + 1, 
(14) 
and Qm (T, x) is the largest interval possessing these two properties. Then we observe 
that there exist infinitely many {m I, ... , mq } and non-empty interval I such that 
q 
Ie n Q2mrl (Tj, Xj). 
j=1 
Thus the set E is captured by Q2m j -I (Tj, X j) in the following way: 
q 
(2N - 2 + n) n n Q2m r 1 (T j, X j) 
j=1 
::::> (2N-2+n)nI == E. 
Now we noticed that the following crucial estimate holds: 
(15) 
(16) 
(17) 
In fact, assume p > q. Denote E = {2k - 2 + n I ko .:s k .:s ko + p - I} for some 
ko E N. Then by (9), (10), (13), (14), and (16), there are critical points u~~. of fa 
} 
such that 
Ck = fa(u~~), 
} 
Vko .:s k .:s ko + p - 1, 1 .:s j Sq. 
(18) 
Because p > q, there exist at least two k i= I in {ko, ... , ko + p -
1} and one 
j E {I, ... , q} such that 
Ck = fa(u~~) = ct· 
} 
(19) 
Then by a Ljustemik-Schnirelman type argument of Ekeland et al. in terms of 
the Fadell-Rabinowitz index (cf. (3.3) below), (19) implies # jc£) = +00. This 
contradiction proves the estimate (17). 
In Section 3 below, (17) is realized by showing the existence of an injection map \11 : 
k 1-+ ([(Tj, Xj)], m) defined by Lemma 3.5 below, where ([(Tj, Xj)], m) corresponds 
to the critical point u~ of fa such that (9) and (10) hold, and \11 induces an injection 
-
q 
-
map \11 from (2N - 2 + n) n nj=l Q2mrl (Tj, Xj) to :JCL.). 

15.0 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
319 
(3) Because of (17), precise values of the iterated indices appearing in (16) become 
very crucial. To further our study, we need to find precisely the iteration time m} 
and the interval I in (15) simultaneously and to make # [ as large as possible. This 
is realized by applying the common index jump Theorems 11.2.1 and 11.2.2, and 
Corollary 11.2.4 to associated symplectic paths Yx j of (r), x} ). By this method, 
we obtain an integer N and iteration times m 1, ... , mq such that (15) holds with 
I = [2N -
Kl, 2N + K2] for some constants K] and K2 > 0 depending only on I;. 
(4) To further estimate # [in (17), we define a new invariant Qn (I;) of I; E 1i(2n) 
by the initial indices (i (x j, 1), v(X}, 1)) and splitting numbers S+ (X}) for 1 :s j :s q 
(cf. Definition 4.1 below). By our understanding of these indices and splitting 
numbers for closed characteristics, we further obtain: 
#[ ::: Qn(I;) 
(20) 
This proves (0.0.16) and (0.0.17) of Theorem C in the Introduction. When every 
(r j, X}) is non-degenerate, by the definition of Qn (I;) and the first inequality in (20), 
we obtain (0.0.18), i.e., Qn(I;) ::: n. 
Ideas in this proof are illustrated in Example 3.7 below for three closed character-
istics by I = [33,38] and [ = {33, 35, 37}. 
B 
Ideas of the proof of the multiplicity result 
(0.0.19) in Theorem C for symmetric hypersurfaces 
Fix a I; E 1is(2n) and suppose # j(I;) < +00. The main idea of our proof is the 
following. 
(1) Let O(x) = x(R) for any closed characteristic (r, x) E :f(I;). Lemma 6.1 
below shows that every (r, x) E :f(I;) is either symmetric, i.e., O(x) = O( -x), or 
asymmetric, i.e., O(x) n O( -x) = 0. Moreover, any symmetric (r, x) satisfies 
x (t + ~) = -x(t), 
"It E R, 
(21) 
and any asymmetric (r, x) satisfies 
(i(x, m), vex, m)) = (i(-x, m), v(-x, m)), 
"1m EN. 
(22) 
Suppose # j(I;) < +00. Denote the numbers of symmetric and asymmetric elements 
in j(I;) by p and q. Write 
j(I;) = {[(r), Xj)] I j = 1, ... , p} 
(23) 
U {[(rk, Xk)], [(rk, -Xk)] I k = p + 1, ... , p + q}. 
(2) Applying the common index jump Theorem 11.2.1 to associated symplectic 
paths of 

320 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
we obtain an integer N and iteration times mI, ... , mp+2q with the rather 
precise information on the Maslov-type indices of iterations of ('l'j, X j) as listed in 
(6.8)-(6.15) below. By Lemma 3.5 below, we obtain an injection map \{I : N -+ 
jC'E) x N given by 
\{I(N - s + 1) = ([(Tk(s) , Xk(s»]. m(s», 
for s = 1, ... , n, 
(24) 
so that 
2(N - s + 1) - 2 + n E Im(s)(Tk(s), Xk(s», 
for s = 1, ... , n. 
(3) Let 
S[ = {s E {l, .. . , n} I, k(s) S qd, 
S2 = {I, ... , n} \S[. 
(25) 
Then we prove 
(26) 
Then this implies 
(4) To prove the first estimate in (26), using the property (21) of symmetric orbit 
(T, x) and precise index information of iterations of (Tj , x j) obtained in the step (2), 
we conclude that the Maslov-type index, nUllity, and splitting numbers of xl[o,T] are 
the same as those of y == (xl[o,T/2])2. Therefore 
i(x, 1) + 2S+(x) - vex, 1) = iCy, 2) + 2s+(i) - v(y, 2) 2: n. 
By this estimate, we get that the integer m(s) in (24) is uniquely determined by k(s), 
provided k(s) S p. Then the injection map \{I of (24) induces an injection map from 
S 1 to {[ (T j, X j)] 11 s j S p} and yields the first estimate in (26). 
(5) To prove the second estimate in (26), using the property (22) of asymmetric 
orbit (T, x) and precise index information of iterations of (Tj, X j) obtained in step (2), 
we conclude that the integer m(s) in (24) possesses at most two choices determined 
by the k(s) there, provided p < k(s) S p + q. Then the injection map \{I of (24) 
induces a map from S2 to r == {[(Tj, Xj)] I p < j S P + q} such that any element in 
r is the image of at most two numbers in S2. This yields the second estimate in (26), 
and completes the proof of (0.0.19) of Theorem C.

Ideas of the proof of the stability result in Theorem D 
For the existence of at least one elliptic closed characteristic on ~ when # j(~) < 
+00, we use the common index jump Theorems 11.2.1 and 11.2.2, and the iteration 
inequality Theorem 10.2.4, and conclude that the elliptic height e(xj) = 2n for at

least one j E {I, ... , q }. Note that the first elliptic closed characteristic corresponds 
to the vertex point X of the cube [0, l]n in (11.1.22) found in Step 2 of the proof of 
the common selection Theorem 11.1.1. For the proof of the second conclusion of 
Theorem D, our method is to find out two such vertices, and show that they correspond 
to two elliptic closed characteristics. 
This chapter is organized as follows. In Sections 1 to 3, we study basic properties of 
closed characteristics. In Section 4 we study the existence and multiplicity problem 
and prove results (0.0.16)-(0.0.18) in Theorem C of the Introduction of this book 
for general hypersurfaces. In Section 5, we study the stability problem and prove 
Theorem D in the Introduction. In Section 6, we study the multiplicity result (0.0.19) 
in Theorem C of the Introduction for symmetric hypersurfaces, and prove a beautiful 
result [DDEl] of G.P' Dell' Antonio, B. D'Onofio, and I. Ekeland, which shows 
that any I; E Hs (2n) carries at least one elliptic closed characteristic. In the last 
section of Notes and Comments, we give more comments on the history and further 
considerations for this closed characteristic problem. 
IS.1 
Index theorem for dual action principle 
The aim in this section is to prove the relation theorem of the Ekeland index theory 
for convex Hamiltonian systems and the index theory of symplectic paths defined in 
Chapter 5. 
For any r and s > 0, we consider the linear Hamiltonian system 
{ yet) = J B(t)y(t), 
y(ST) = yeO). 
Here we suppose the coefficient B to satisfy the following conditions: 
(Bl) B E C(Sr, Ls(R2n)) with Sr = R/(rZ), 
(B 2) B (t) is positive definite fa r all t E R. 
(1) 
Fix a E (1,2). For any rand s > 0, following §IA of I. Ekeland's book [Eke3], 
we define 
Ls = {u E L 2«0, sr), R2n) I 1
ST udt = o} , 
with the usual L2-norm 
lIulls = (1
S IUl2dtY/2 
(2) 
(3) 
Then Ls becomes a Hilbert space. The Clarke-Ekeland dual action functional Qs : 
Ls --+ R corresponding to problem (1) is defined by 
QsCu) = -
{Ju . Ilsu + B-1(t)Ju . Ju}dt, 
1 loST 
2 0 
(4) 

322 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
where I1su is defined by fr I1su = u and f~r I1udt = O. Then by the study in [Eke3], 
Ls possesses a Qs orthogonal decomposition 
Ls = L; (£) L~ (£) L-;, 
such that Qs is positive, null, and negative definite on L;, L~, and L-; respectively, 
and 
i; (B) == dim L-; < +00, 
(5) 
Os v;(B) == dim L~ S 2n. 
(6) 
(if (B), vf (B)) are the Ekeland index and nullity of (1) with s = 1 introduced by 
I. Ekeland in [Ekel] of 1984. 
The following theorem is the main result in this section. 
Theorem I (V. Brousseau [Brol], Y. Long [LonI4]). Suppose (Bl) and (B2) hold, 
and ex E (1, 2). Then 
i(B,l)=if(B)+n, 
v(B, 1) =vf(B). 
(7) 
In order to prove this theorem, we need the following characterization of Ekeland 
index and nullity, whose proof can be found in Chapter 1 of [Eke3]. 
Proposition 2 Suppose conditions (B 1) and (B2) hold. Then 
10 (Theorem 1.4.4 of [Eke3]) it holds that 
v;(B) = v(Bs, 1), 
where Bs is the restriction of B to [0, s]. 
20 (Theorem 1.4.6 of[Eke3]) it holds that 
if(B) = L v;(Bs). 
O<s<1 
(8) 
(9) 
Denote the fundamental solution of system (1) by y. Then we have the following 
similar result. 
Proposition 3 Suppose conditions (Bl) and (B2) hold. Then 
iCy, 1) = L V(Y(H), 1) + n. 
(10) 
O<s < 1 
Proof: Set T = 1. Denote Ys(t) = y(st) for s, t E [0,1]. By (8) and (9), there exist 
only finitely many times {s} I j = 1, ... , k} C (0,1) such that yes}) E Sp(2n)?, i.e., 
v(y}, 1) > 0, where y} = YS j , for lEI> 0 so small that 
v(Blro,sj+s), 1) = 0, 
'10 < lsi s E, 1 S j S k. 
Denote Yj+E(t) = y«S} + E)t) for t E [0,1]. 

15.1 Index theorem/or dual action principle 
We claim that for E > 0 sufficiently small, 
Yj+E "'1 (Yj h· 
where (Yj)1 is the perturbation path of Yj defined by (5.4.6). 
In fact, we first define a new path f3 E PI (2n) by 
for 0 :::: t :::: e, 
for e :::: t :::: 1, 
323 
(11) 
(12) 
where e = Sj/(Sj + E), P E Sp(2n) is given by the normal form Theorem 1.7.3 for 
M = Y(Sj) ' Then for t E [e, 1] we have 
A(t) 
-I~(t)f3(t) - 1 
-e-I Iy(sj)P I(y(sj)p)-I 
_e- 1 I I ((y (s j) p)- O)T (Y(Sj) p)-I 
= e-1((Y(Sj)p)-1)T (Y(Sj)p)-I. 
Thus A(t) is positive definite for any t E [e, 1]. Let 
Ds(t) = (1 - s)BSj+E(t) + sA(t), 
"It E [e , 1], S E [0, 1]. 
Then D S (t) is positive definite, and the fundamental solution f3s (.) of the system (1) 
with B replaced by Ds satisfying f3s (e) = Y (s j) yields a homotopy 8 : [0, 1] x 
[e, 1] --+ Sp(2n) from YSj+E to f3 by 
8(s , t) = f3s(t), 
for e :::: t :::: 1. 
We extend 8(s, t) by 
8(s, t) = y((Sj +E)t), 
for 0:::: t:::: e, 0:::: S:::: 1. 
By Proposition 2, for sufficiently small E > 0 this yields v(8(s, ·),1) = 0 for all 
S E [0, 1]. Thus 
YSj+E "'I f3. 
(13) 
Now applying rotations in the definition of (Yj h in (5.4.6) first, and then plugging 
a parameter S into other rotation parts in f31[e,o] yields the second homotopy 
(14) 
Thus claim (11) holds. 
Especially this argument implies 
i(Ys,I)=n, 
VO<S<SI ,

where ys(t) = y(st) for 0 < t ::s 1. Note that (15) can also be obtained by 
Proposition 13.2.3. 
Similarly, we can prove 
for sufficiently small E > 0 and 1 ::s j ::s k, where (y) )-1 is defined by (5.4.6). 
Therefore together with Theorem 5.4.1, we obtain 
Now summing (17) up for j = 1, ... , k, together with (15) we obtain 
i(y, 1) 
Thus (10) holds. 
Now we can give

Proof of Theorem 1: (7) follows from (8), (9), and (10). 
As a corollary of Theorem 1, we obtain 
Corollary 4 It holds that 
i(x, 1) ::: n, 
VCr, x) E .1('£, a). 
This is also a special case of Proposition 13.2.3.

Remark 5 For r > 0 denote by £r (2n) the set of Y E i\ (2n) which are fundamental 
solutions of the linear systems (1) with negative definite B(t) for all t E [0, r]. 
In his works [Ekel]-[Eke3], I. Ekeland systematically studied such Hamiltonian 
systems and defined his index function theory via the dual action principle. For any 
Y E £r(2n), denote the Ekeland index function by (Jw(Y), nw(Y)) for all wE U via 
Definition 1.5.3 of [Eke3]. Note that (JI (y), n 1 (y)) is the Ekeland index defined by 
Definition 1.4.3 of [Eke3]. It should be pointed out that (JI (y) , nl (y)) here is not 
the index (i f, vf) defined by above (5) and (6), because of the different "J" used in 
these two cases. The following result gives the relation between our index function 
theory and Ekeland's. For the proof of this theorem, we refer the reader to [LonI6].

Remark 7 Theorem 1 was proved by V. Brousseau in [BroI] of 1990 for the non-
degenerate case, and by the author in [LonI4] of 1998 for the degenerate case. The 
proof given here is different from those in [BroI] and [Lon14] and is based on 
I. Ekeland's Theorems 1.4.4 and 1.4.6 in [Eke3] and properties of our index, especially 
Theorem 5.4.1. 
15.2 Variational properties 
In this section we study the basic variational properties of closed characteristics. 
To solve the given energy problem (0.4)-(0.6), we consider a fixed period problem 
with a E (1, 2) and Ha given by (0.3), 
Let 
{ Z(t) = JH~(z(t», 
z(I) = z(O). 
Vt E R , 
Ea = ! 
U E La/(a - I)(R/Z), R2n) 110 1 udt = 0) , 
(1) 
(2) 
with the usual L a/(a-I) norm. The Clarke-Ekeland dual action functional fa : Ea ---+ 
R is defined by 
fa(u) = 10
1 {~Ju. Ilu + H~(-JU)} dt, 
(3) 
where Ilu is defined by -it Ilu = u and J~ Iludt = O. The Fenchel conjugate 
H~ : R 2n ---+ R is defined by 
H~(x) = sup {x· y - Ha(Y)}. 
(4) 
yER2n 
Then fa E C2(Ea, R). Suppose u E Ea \ {OJ is a critical point of fa. By [Eke3], 
there exists ~u E R2n such that zu(t) = Ilu(t) + ~u is a I-periodic solution of the 
problem (0.4). 

326 
15 
Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
In [Ekel]-[Eke3], I. Ekeland proved that the Hessian of fa at its critical point u 
possesses finite Morse index and nullity, which are the so-called Ekeland index and 
nullity, and denoted by if(u) and vf(u) respectively. 
Let h = Ha(zu(t» and 11m be the minimal period of Zu for some mEN. Define 
xu(t) = h- l /azu(h(2-a)/a t ) 
and 
r = 2..h(a-2)/a. 
m 
(5) 
Then xu(t) E 2: for all t E Rand (r, xu) E .:7(2:, a). Note that the period 1 of Zu 
corresponds to the period mr of the solution (mr, x:) of (0.4)-(0.6) with minimal 
period r. 
The following propositions relate the Ekeland index to the index given by 
Definitions 5.4.3 and 8.0.1. 
Proposition 1 For u and Xu defined above. 
i(xu, 1) = if(u) + n, 
Proof: This follows from Theorem 1.1 directly. 
Proposition 2 For Zu. xu. rand m defined above. 
i(xu, m) = i(zu, 1), 
v(xu, m) = v(zu, 1). 
(6) 
D 
(7) 
Proof: Let 1/1 : [0, +00) --+ Sp(2n) be the associated symplectic path of zu, i.e., the 
fundamentalsolutionof(1.1)withB(t) = H:;(zu(t». Thusbydefinition,i(zu, 1) = 
i (1/1, 1). 
Define 
y(t) = 1/I(h(2-a)/at ), 
"It E [0, +00). 
(8) 
Then using the positive homogeneity of H:;, we obtain that y : [0, +00) --+ Sp(2n) 
is the fundamental solution of the system (1.1) with coefficient B(t) = H:;(xu(t», 
i.e., y coincides with the associated symplectic path of xu' Thus by (5) and (8), 
y(mr) = 1/1(1). This implies v(xu, m) = v(zu, 1). Since yl[o.mr] is only a rescaling 
of 1/11[0.1], they are geometrically the same path in Sp(2n). This yields i(xu, m) = 
i(yl[O,mr], 1) = i(1/I1[0,1], 1) = i(zu, 1), and completes the proof. 
D 
On the other hand, every solution (r, x) E :1(2:, a) gives rise to a sequence 
{Z~JmEN of solutions of the problem (1), and a sequence {U~}mEN of critical points 
of fa defined by 
z~(t) = (mr)-I/(2-a)x(mrt), 
(9) 
u~(t) = (mr)(a-l)/(2-a)x(mrt).

Lemma 3 (Lemma 1.7.3 of [Eke3]). For any (r, x) E :feb, a), denote by Yx the 
associated symplectic path of x. Then 
Yx(r)x(O) = x(O), 
(13) 
yx(r)x(O) = r(a - 2)x(0) + x(O). 
(14) 
Proof: For the reader's convenience, the proof is given here. 
Let Xh(t) = hl/ax(thCa-2)/a) and rh = rh C2- a)/a for h > O. Then (rh' Xh) is a 
solution of (0.4)-(0.5) with 
(15) 
and it holds that 
(16) 
Let YhCt) = y(th Ca- 2)/a) for t 2: O. Then Yh is the associated symplectic path of 
Xh, i.e., the fundamental solution of the linear system (0.7) with x replaced by Xh· 
Especially, 
Yh(rh) (:h Xh) (0) == :h xh(rh)· 
Differentiating (15) with respect to h yields

and by the definition of Xh we have 
Together with Yh(-rh) = y(r), we obtain from (19),

= .!..h(l-a)/ax(O).

Setting h = 1 in (20) yields 
r(2 - a)x(r) + y(r)x(O) = x(O). 
This implies (14).

Lemma 4 For any (r, x) E ..1("£, a), there exist P E Sp(2n) and M E Sp(2n - 2) 
such that 
(22) 
where N 1 (l, 1) is the normal form defined by (1.4.1). 
Proof: Fix (r, x) E .:l(,,£, a). Let Yx be the associated symplectic path of x and 
~l = rea - 2)x(0), 
~2 = x(O). 
We carry out the proof in three steps. 
Step 1 Since x = x (t) is a solution of (0.4), we have x (0) E ~ and x (0) = J H~ (x (0». 
Since ~ is convex and C2, by a direct computation and the fact that 1 < a < 2, we 
obtain 
~t J~2 = rea -
2)H~(x(0» . x(O) < O. 
(23) 
Note that from Lemma 3, the span Of~l and ~2 form an invariant subspace of yx(r). 
By (23), a rescaling of ~l and ~2 forms a symplectic basis of this invariant subspace. 
Since Yx (r) is symplectic, (22) then results. In the following we use the argument in 
Section 1.4 to give a different proof. 
Step 2 Now suppose {~l, b ... ,~p} form a Jordan block of yAr) belonging to the 
eigenvalue 1, i.e., setting ~o = 0, 
VI :s i :s p. 
(24) 

15.3 Critical orbits and index jumps

For 1 S i, j S p by (24) we have 
This yields

--

(26) 
where [a] = maxim E Z 1m S a} for any a E R, and (26) follows from (25) by 
induction. 
Thus from (23) and (26) we must have p = 2, i.e., ~1 and ~2 form a Jordan block 
of Yx (r) belonging to the eigenvalue 1. 
Step 3 Define 
(27) 
Then 
(28) 
i.e., {01, 02} form a symplectic base for F. Denote by K the 2n x 2 matrix formed by 
01 and 02 as the first and the second columns. From (21), (27), and (28), we obtain 
yx(r)K = K N\ (1,1). Now we can extend K to a matrix P E Sp(2n) such that 01 
and 02 form the first and the (n + 1)-st columns of P and for some M E Sp(2n - 2) 
such that (22) holds. This proves the lemma.

Remark 5 Lemma 4 holds for a = 2 or a > 2 with N) (1,1) in (22) being replaced 
by 12 or Nl (1, -1) respectively. Note also that Lemmas 3 and 4 hold for star-shape 
hypersurfaces too. 
Proposition 2 and Lemma 4 were proved in [LonI4] of 1998. 
15.3 
Critical orbits and index jumps 
Next we consider critical points produced by the Fadell-Rabinowitz cohomological 
index theory. 
For a principal U (1 )-bundle E -+ B, the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of E is defined 
to be 
sup{k I CJ (E)k-l t= O}, 

330 
15 
Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
where CI (E) E H2(B, Q) is the first rational Chern class. For a U(I)-space, i.e., a 
topological space X with a U(l)-action, the Fadell-Rabinowitz index is defined to 
be the index of the bundle 
X x SOC ~ X xU(1) Soc, 
where Soc ~ Cpoc is the universal U(l)-bundle. For the details of the Fadell-
Rabinowitz index theory, we refer readers to their original paper [FaRl] and 
Section V.3 of I. Ekeland's book [Eke3]. A more analytical approach can be found 
in [Benl] of Y. Benci. 
Following §V.3 of [Eke3], we denote by "ind" the Fadell-Rabinowitz SI-action 
cohomology index theory for Sl-invariant subsets of Ea. Using the index theory 
defined in Chapter 5, the results of Ekeland et al contained in (Y.3.21), (V.3.22), 
Proposition Y.3.3, and Theorem Y.3.4 in Section V.3 of [Eke3] can be rephrased as 
follows. 
Theorem 1 For 
[fa]c == (u E Ea I fa(u) ::::: C}, 
define 
Ck = inf{c < 0 I ind([fa]c) 2: k}, 
Yk EN. 
(1) 
Then {Ck} are critical values of f. 
They satisfy 
-00 < CI = 
inf fa(u)::::: C2 ::::: ... ::::: Ck ::::: cHI::::: ... < 0, 
(2) 
uEEa 
# jC'£') = +00, 
if Ck = CHI for some kEN. 
(3) 
For any given kEN, there exists (r, x) E :J('£, a) and mEN such that for u::n 
defined by (2.10), 
(4) 
i(x, m) ::::: 2k - 2 + n ::::: i(x, m) + vex, m) -
1. 
(5) 
By our study in the previous sections, we have 
Lemma 2 Fix '£ E H(2n) and a E (1,2). For any (r, x) E :J('£, a) and mEN, 
i(x, m + 1) - i(x, m) 2: 2, 
(6) 
i(x, m + 1) - i(x, m) - vex, m) > i(x, 1) _ e(y~(r)) + 1

i(x, m) + vex, m) - 1, 
vex, m) ::: vex, 1) ::: 1, 
(9) 
t(x, 1) > 2. 
(10) 
Proof: By Theorem 10.2.4 and (1.18) we obtain (6), (7), and (8). Since the system 
(0.4) is autonomous, (9) follows. (10) follows from Corollary 8.3.2, (1.18), and 
Lemma 2.4. 
D 
Based upon (4) and (5), we introduce the following definitions. 
Definition 3 For any b E H(2n) and a E (1,2), (r, x) E J(b, a) is (m, k)-
variationally visible, if there exist some m and kEN such that (4) and (5) hold 
for u~ defined by (2.10). We call (r, x) E J(b, a) infinite variationally visible, 
if there exist infinitely many (m, k) such that (r, x) is (m, k)-variationally visible. 
We denote by V(b, a) (or Voo(b, a» the subset of JCE,) in which a representative 
(r, x) E J(b, a) of each [(r, x)] is variationally visible (or infinite variationally 
visible). 
Suggested by (4) and (5), we introduce index intervals and index covers. 
Definition 4 For any (r, x) E J(b, a), we define the m-th index interval of (r, x) 
by the closed interval 
Im(r, x) = [i(x, m), i(x, m) + vex, m) - 1]. 
We call the set 
the index cover set of (r, x). 
I(r, x) = U Im(r, x), 
m2:! 
(11) 
(12) 
Note that the inequalities (7) and (1.18) especially imply that all index intervals of 
(r, x) are mutually disjoint. (7) especially introduces a way to estimate the ellipticity 
of (r, x) in terms of its iterated indices for some mEN. 
Now (5) can be restated as 
2N -2+n C 
lJ 
I(r, x). 
(13) 
[(T,X)]EJCE.a) 
We call integers in the sequence 2N - 2 + n effective integers. 
Now in the following we suppose 
# j(b) < +00. 
(14) 

332 
15 
Closed characteristics on convex hypersuifaces 
Then by (3) no equality in (2) can hold, i.e., we must have 
-00 < ci < c2 < ... < q < Ck+1 < ... < O. 
(15) 
Here we have used the method of Fadell-Rabinowitz Si-cohomology index theory 
(cf. [FaRI]) via Theorem V.3.4 of [Eke3]. Note that here each Ck corresponds 
uniquely to an effective integer 2k - 2 + n. We observe that in this case there is a 
one to one correspondence between the effective integers and index intervals of all 
closed characteristic [(r, x)] in Voo (1: , a). In other words, under condition (14), an 
injective map \II : N -+ Voo(1:, a) x N can be defined by (4), (5), and (15), which 
makes precise the correspondence between effective integers and iterations of closed 
characteristics. 
Lemma 5 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Suppose # }(1:, a) < +00. Then there 
exist an integer K ::: 0 and an injection map \II : N + K -+ Voo (1:, a) x N such 
that 
(i) for any kEN + K, (r, x) E .1(1:, a) and mEN satisfying \II(k) = 
([(r, x)], m), (4) and (5) hold, and 
(ii) for any kj E N + K, kl < k2, (rj, Xj) E .1(1:, a) satisfying \II(kj)

(16) 
Proof: (i) By Theorem Y.3.4 of[Eke3],foreachk E N,thereisa(r,x) E .J(1:,a) 
such that (r, x) is (m, k)-variationally visible for some mEN, i.e., [(r, x)] E 
V(1:, a). We define a map \III : N -+ V(1:, a) x N by \III (k) = ([(r, x)], m). Since 
}(1:) < +00, (15) holds by Theorem V.3.4 of [Eke3], i.e., Cj < q < 0 whenever 
j < k. Thus if \III (j) = \III (k) = ([r, x)], m) for some j < k, by (4), we obtain 
Cj = feu;') = q. 
This contradiction proves that \III is injective. 
Since # }(1:) < +00, there exists an integer K ::: 0 such that all critical values 
Ck+K with kEN come from iterations of elements in Voo (1: , a). Thus \III (k + K) E 
VooC1:, a) x N for any kEN. We define 
\II(k) = \II1(k), 
Vk E N + K. 
(17) 
Then \II is injective, and (4) and (5) hold. 
(ii) By Theorem V.3.11 of [Eke3], we have y == y-C1:) = y+(1:) > 0, where 
y±(1:) are defined by (V.3.62)-(V.3.65) of [Eke3] as follows: 
C;llim sup(( _q)(2-a)/a k)-I,

(18) 
For kEN + K, let ([(r, x)], m) = llI(k) for some [(x , r)] E Voo(~ , a) and 
mEN. Then (x, r) is (m, k)-variationally visible. So by (Y.3.45) of [Eke3], 
Ck = f(u':r,) , 
ICkI2~a = 2(Ca mA(r, x)) - l = 2(Ca A(mr, xrn))-l, 
where A(r, x) is defined by (2.12). Note that by Lemma y'3.12 of [Eke3] and (9.2.25), 
This implies

Since Ck < CHI < 0 for kEN, we get our results.

From our observations on the weakly non-resonant ellipsoid and studies of the 
case of 1{(4) in [Lon18] as well as our study of 1{(6), we noticed that in order to 
maximize the effect of the Fadell-Rabinowitz Sl-index theory, instead of the index 
interval Irn (r, x), we should consider the largest open interval which contains 
Irn (r, x), possesses no part of any other index interval of (r, x), and still can be 
used as the target of the map Ill. This leads to our introduction of the index jump of 
(r, x) using Definition 11.2.3. 
Definition 6 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For ~ E 1{(2n) and a E (1,2), we 
define the moth index jump Qrn(r, x) of (r, x) E J(~ , a) by the open interval 
Qrn(r, x) = Qrn(Yx) = (i(x, m) + vex, m) -
1, i(x, m + 2». 
(19) 
When (14) holds, we have Voo(~, a) I- 0 and we write 
(20) 
By property (10), we observe that the common index jump Theorems 11.2.1, 11.2.2, 
and Corollary 11.2.4 can be applied to yield infinitely many chances that the index 
jumps of all the q closed characteristics contain common intervals, i.e., there exist 
infinitely many (N , m l , ... , mq) E Nq+ 1 such that 
q

where 
K2 == K2(~, a) = min (i(Xj, 1) - I),

l:Sj:sq 
and S+ (x j) = S~ (OJ) (1). Note that here by (1.18), Lemma 2.4, Theorems 9.1.7, and 
9.1.10 on the splitting numbers, we obtain 
KI 2: n + 2 - 2n = 2 - n, 
(24) 
K2 2: n - 1. 
(25) 
Thus especially we have 
(26) 
So the left interval in (21) is non-empty. We shall get a better estimate on KI later in 
Section 4 below to estimate the size of the interval [2N -KI, 2N +K2]. This important 
phenomenon will be used in our proofs of the main theorems on the existence of 
multiple closed characteristics on any ~ E 1i(2n) in this chapter. 
Example 7 We study the index jumps of closed characteristics on the weakly non-
resonant ellipsoid £3(r) in R6 defined by (0.8) as an example, where we set r = 
(rl' r2, r3) with

This example suggests our general observations on the common index jump theorem. 
In this case the corresponding Hamiltonian function is quadratic and is given by 
Then solving explicitly the linear Hamiltonian system 
y = JH'(y), 
(28) 
we obtain precisely three two-parameter families of periodic solutions of (28). By 
requiring H(y) = I, we obtain precisely three elements in j(~), which we denote 
by [(!j, Xj)] for j = 1,2, and 3 respectively according to the action 
(29) 

15.3 Critical orbits and index jumps 
335 
Note that all of them are strongly elliptic, so their nullities are always 2. When we 
choose Ci E (l, 2), their nullities are always 1, and their indices are the same as those 
when Ci = 2 by Proposition 1.7.5 of [Eke3]. Denote the indices and the splitting 
numbers of these three closed characteristics by (i(xj, m), v(Xj, m)) and S+(Xj) 
respectively for mEN and j = 1,2,3. Then for these m and j when Ci E (1,2), 
i(Xl,m) = 2m + 1 +2 [m;;U] +2 [~:], 
i(x2,m) 
= 2m+l+2[m~]+2[2~7rJ. 
i(x3,m) = 2m + 1 +2 [~] +2 [~], 
v(Xj, m) 
1, 
S+(Xj) 
1. 
Thus we obtain Kl = 3 and K2 = 2. By these iteration formulae, we obtain 
2N - 2 + 3 = U}=lI(Tj, Xj), 
I(Tj, Xj) nI(Tk, Xk) = 0, 
VI :S j < k:S 3. 
Therefore all these three closed characteristics are infinite variationally visible. The 
invariant Q3(~) for ~ = [3(r) defined by (15.4.1) below is given by 
From the above iteration formulae of x j, we can list the sequences of indices as 
follows, for example, up to m = 10:

Closed characteristics on convex hypersuifaces 
where ml = 4, m2 = 3, m3 = 2, and N = 18. This illustrates the common index

# -

In the next section, we shall use numbers of effective integers in the interval [2N -
Kl, 2N + K2] to estimate # j('2'.) from below as in (22) of the Introduction of this 
book. 
Remark 8 Definitions 3 and 4 were introduced in [LonI4] of 1998. Lemma 5 and 
Definition 6 were proved or introduced by C. Zhu and the author in the recent [LZu3]. 
The explanation of the Fadell-Rabinowitz cohomological index at the beginning of 
this section was given by J. Mather as an appendix of [LZu3]. 
15.4 Existence and mUltiplicity 
In this section, we study the existence and multiplicity of closed characteristics on 
any '2'. E H(2n). We introduce the invariant Qn : H(2n) ~ N U Hoo} first. 
Definition 1 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). For a E (1,2), we define a map Qn : 
H(2n) ~ N U Hoo} by 
1
+00, 
if 
#V('2'., a) = +00, 
Qn('2'.) = 
min{[i(X,1)+2S+~)-v(x,1)+n] I 
[(r, x)] E Voo('2'., a)}, 
if 
#V('2'., a) < +00. 
(1) 
where (i(x, 1), vex, 1) is the index of (r, x) defined in Chapter 5, S+(x) = St;.(l) 
is the splitting number of (r, x) with M = yx(r), and V ('2'. , a) and Voo('2'., a) are 
given by Definition 3.3. 
Note that when # j('2'.) < +00, the set Voo('2'., a) is non-empty and finite, Our 
next lemma shows that Qn('2'.) does not depend on the choice of a E (1,2) and is 
shape invariant, i.e., is independent of dilation of '2'.. 
Lemma 2 Fix '2'. E H(2n) and a E (1,2). 
(i) Qn('2'.) defined by (1) does not depend on the choice of a E (1,2). 
(ii) For any s > 0 and '2'. E H(2n), it holds that Qn(sI:) = Qn('2'.). 
Proof: (i) follows from Proposition 1.7.5 of [Eke3] and a similar proof for the index 
functions and splitting numbers. 
(ii) By the definition of the gauge function j'):, of '2'. for any s > 0 we have 
jsE(X) = s-lh(x), 
Hs,a(x) == jsE(X)a = s-a Ha(x), 

15.4 Existence and multiplicity 
337 
where Ha is defined by (0.3). Let (r, x) E .J('E" a). Then r is the minimal period 
of x and Ha(x(t)) = l. Set yet) = sx(s-2t ). Then s2r is the minimal period of y 
and Hs,a(y(t)) = l. Since x is a solution of (0.4)-(0.6), we have 
yet) = s-l J H~(x(s-2t)) 
= s-a J H~(sx(s-2t)) 
= J H; a(y(t)). 
So we have (s2r, y) E .J(s'E" a). So the map from .J('E" a) to .J(s'E" a) defined by 
(r, x) H- (s2r, sx(s-2t )) is a bijection. 
Let Yx be the associated symplectic path of (r, x). Then we have 
d 
dt yx(s-2t ) = s-2 J H;(x(s-2t ))yx(s-2t )) 
= s-a J H:(sx(s-2t))yx(s-2t )) 
= J H;' a (y(t))yx (s-2t )). 
So the associated symplectic path of (s2r, y) is yy(t) = yx(s-2t ). Hence our lemma 
follows. 
0 
The following is our main existence result on the closed characteristics, which 
implies the result (0.0.16) and (0.0.17) in Theorem C in the Introduction of the book. 
In thefollowing, when # j('E,) < +00, we always denote the elements in Voo('E" a) 
by 
Voo('E" a) = {[(r) , Xj)] I j = 1, ... , q}, 
(2) 
for some integer q, where (r), x j) E .J('E" a) for j = 1, ... , q. Note that by (3.13), 
we always have 
q?:.l. 
Theorem 3 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let'E, E H(2n) and 1 < a < 2. Suppose 
# j('E,) < +00. Then 
(3) 
Proof: Because # j('E,) < +00, by Lemma 3.5 there exist an integer K ?:. 0 and an 
injection map IlJ : N + K --+ Voo('E" a) x N such that 
i(x, m) :s 2k - 2 + n :s i(x, m) + vex, m) - 1 
(4) 
holds for any kEN + K, (r, x) E .J('E" a) and llJ(k) = ([(r, x)], m).

Closed characteristics on convex hypersuifaces 
By Lemma 2.4 and (3.10), 
we can apply the common index jump 
Theorems 11.2.1 and 11.2.2, and obtain infinitely many (N, ml, ... , mq) E Nq+1 
such that 
q nY2mr l ('fj,Xj):J [2N-KI,2N+K2], 
j=1 
q 
UI2mj(tj,Xj) C [2N-n,2N-2+n], 
j=1 
(5) 
(6) 
where KI = KI (~, ex) and K2 = K2 (~, ex) are defined by (3.22) and (3.23) respectively. 
We continue the proof in the following three claims. 
Claim lIt holds that 
q ~ #«2N - 2 + n) n [2N - KI, 2N + K2]) ~ Qn(~). 
(7) 
In fact, by the definition of the interval [2N -
KI, 2N + K2], the injection map \11 
defined by Lemma 3.5 induces another injection map \11' from the set (2N - 2 + n) n 
[2N -
KI, 2N + K2] to Voo(~, ex) x N. But by (4) and the definition of the index 
jump Y2mj-1 (rj, Xj), no two iterations of one element [(rj, Xj)} in Voo(~, ex) can be 
the image points of \11' simultaneously. Thus we obtain the left inequality in (7). 
To prove the right inequality in (7), we set 
\I1(N - s + 1) = ([(rj(s), Xj(s)], m(s)), 
'is = 1, ... , Qn(~), 
(8) 
where j (s) E {I, ... , q} and m (s) EN. Then by the definition of the map \11 in 
Lemma 3.5, we obtain 
i(Xj(s), m(s)) ::: 2N - 2s + n ::: i(xj(s), m(s)) + v(Xj(s), m(s)) - 1. 
(9) 
Note that by the definitions (3.22) of KI and (1) of Qn(~) we have 
[ KI + nJ 
Qn(~) = -2-
. 
(10) 
Together with (3.25), we obtain 
2N -KI < 
[KI + nJ 
2N-2 -2-
+n 
< 2N -2s +n 
(11) 
< 2N -2+n 
< 2N +K2, 
for s = 1, ... , Qn (~). Thus the right inequality of (7) holds. This proves Claim 1. 

15.4 Existence and multiplicity 
339 
Note that the only index interval Im(rj(s), Xj(s») contained in the index jump 
g2mj(s)-1 (rj(s), Xj(s)) is the one with m = 2m j(s). Therefore we must have 
m(s) = 2m j(s), 
"Is = 1, ... , QnCE). 
(12) 
Thus by reordering the elements in Voo(I:, a) and Claim 1, 
"Is = 1, ... , Qn(I:). 
(13) 
Next we derive this fact on m(s) and j (s) and give the proof of Claim 1 and the 
above (13) slightly differently by our iteration inequalities obtained before. 
From Definition 3.6 of the index jump, (5), (6), and (9), we obtain 
and 
i(Xj(s), 2mj(s) -
1) + v(Xj(s), 2mj(s) -1)-1 
< 2N -
Kl 
::::: 2N - 2s +n 
::::: i(xj(s), m(s)) + v(Xj(s), m(s)) -
1, 
i(xj(s),m(s)) < 2N-2s+n 
< 2N +K2 
< i(xj(s), 2mj(s) + 1). 
Comparing (14), (15), and (3.8) of Lemma 3.2, we obtain 
2m j(s) - 1 < m(s) < 2m j(s) + 1. 
(14) 
(15) 
Hence m(s) = 2m j(s), and then (13) holds. Note that (7) and then Claim 1 follows 
also from (13) and the injectivity of the map W. 
Claim 2 Qn(I:) ::::: n. 
In fact, assuming Qn(I:) > n we prove the claim indirectly. By Claim 1 and (13) 
with s = n + 1 we obtain 
q :::: n + 1, 
WeN - n) = ([(rn+l, xn+d], 2mn+d· 
Then by (3.5) and (6) we have 
This contradiction proves our Claim 2. 
Claim 3 Qn(I:) :::: [~] + 1.

15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
In fact, let (r, x) E :1 C£, a) and Yx be its associated symplectic path. In the 
following, we estimate i(x, 1) + 2S+(x) - vex, 1) + n. 
By Lemma 2.4, (2.22) holds for some P E Sp(2n) and M E Sp(2n - 2). By 
10 and 20 of Theorem 9.1.9, the splitting numbers are constant on each homotopy 
component and symplectic additive. Thus by (2.22), we get 
2S+(x) - vex, 1) 
= 2stl(l,l)(l) - Vj(NI(1, 1» + 2S,t(l) - vJ(M). 
By Theorem 9.1.7, we obtain 
Thus 
if a 2: 0, 
if a < O. 
2stl (l,a/1) -
VI (NI (1, a» = a, 
for a = ±1, O. 
By Theorem 1.8.10, we obtain 
NI(1, l)0P-ol?OoNI(1, -1)oP+oG E nO(M), 
(17) 
(18) 
(19) 
(20) 
for some nonnegative integers p_, PO, and p+, and some symplectic matrix G satis-
fying 1 ¥. a(G). By (19) and (20), we then obtain 
2S,t(1) - vI(M) 2: p- - p+ 2: -p+ 2: 1 - n. 
From (1.18), (17), (19) with a = 1, and (21), we obtain 
i(x,I)+2S+(x)-v(x,I)+n 2: n+l+(1-n)+n 
= n+2. 
So Claim 3 holds. 
The proof of Theorem 3 is complete. 
(21)

Next we study the non-degenerate case. The following result implies the corre-
sponding result (0.0.18) in Theorem C in the Introduction of the book. 
Theorem4(Y.LongandC.Zhu[LZu3]). FixY; E H(2n) and a E (1,2). Suppose 
every (r, x) E :1(Y;, a) satisfies 
i(x, 1) + 2S+(x) - vex, 1) 2: n. 
(23) 
Then 
(24) 
In particular, when every (r, x) E :1(Y;) is non-degenerate, (23) must hold, and then 
(25) 

15.5 Stability results 
341 
Proof: By the definition of Qn(I;) and (23), we obtain (24). 
If (T, x) E .1(I;, a) is non-degenerate, we must have 1 ~ a(M) in (17). Thus by 
(17) and (19), we obtain 2S+(x) - v(x, 1) = 1. Together with (1.18), we obtain (23). 
So (24) holds. By (3) of Theorem 3, this implies (25). 
0 
Corollary 5 Let I; E 1i(2n) and a E (1,2). Assume # ](I;) < +00. Then there 
exists an element [(T, x)] E Voo(I;, a) with i(x, 1) = n. 
Proof: Using (3), the definition of the map \II in Lemma 3.5, and notation in the 
proof of Theorem 3, we can denote ([(Tj, X j)], m) = \II(N + 1) for some 1 S j S q 
and some mEN. Note that (13) is not applicable here. By the definition of \II and 
(3.5), we obtain 
(26) 
On the other hand, (5) and (6) hold for the 2mj-th iteration of Xj. Thus by (3.25), 
and the right end point properties of (5) and (6), we obtain 
i(xj,2mj)+v(xj,2mj)-1 S 2N-2+n 
< 2N+n 
S 2N + K2 + 1 
s i(xj, 2mj + O. 
Hence by Lemma 3.2, comparing (26) and (27) we obtain 
Thus m = 2m j + 1. By (26) and (27) again we obtain 
i(Xj, 2mj + 1) = 2N + n. 
Now by (11.2.5) of Theorem 11.2.1, we obtain 
i(Xj, 1) = i(xj, 2mj + 1) - 2N = n. 
This completes the proof. 
(27)

Remark 6 Although the global minimal point (T, x) of fa on Ea satisfies i (x, 1) = n, 
it is still not clear to us now whether [( T, x)] E Voo(I; , a). 
15.5 Stability results 
In this section, we study the ellipticity of closed characteristics, and prove Theorem D 
in the Introduction of the book. 

342 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
For I: E H(2n), ex E (1,2), and (r, x) E J(I:, ex), we define the elliptic height 
e(x) of (r, x) to be the elliptic height e(yx (r)), where Yx is the associated symplectic 
path of (r, x). 
We start from the following theorem which implies the first part of Theorem D 
mentioned in the Introduction under condition (0.0.20) there. 
Theorem 1 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let I: E H(2n) and ex E (1,2). Sup-
pose # j(I:) < +00. We use notation introduced in the proof of Theorem 4.3. By 
reordering elements in Voo(I:, ex), (4.13) holds, i.e., 
"Is = 1, ... , Qn(I:). 
(1) 
Then we have 
e(xs) 2: 21n - 2s + 11 + 2, 
"Is = 1, .. . , Qn(I:). 
(2) 
Especially [( rl, XI)] is an elliptic element in Voo(I:, ex). 
Proof: By the definition of the injection map \II in Lemma 3.5, for s = 1, ... , Qn(I:) 
we obtain 
i(xs,2ms) < 2N - 2s + n 
(3) 
< i(xs, 2ms) + v(xs, 2ms) - 1. 
By the first inequality of (10.2.22) in Theorem 10.2.4 and (11.2.5) of the common 
index jump Theorem 11.2.1, we have 
e(xs ) 
2 
2: i(xs, 2ms) + v(xs, 2ms) 
-i(xs, 2ms + 1) + i(xs, 1) + 1 
= i(xs, 2ms) + v(xs, 2ms) - 2N + 1 
2: 2N - 2s + n + 1 - 2N + 1 
= (n - 2s + 1) + 1, 
where the second inequality in (4) follows from the second inequality in (3). 
(4) 
On the other hand, by the second inequality of (10.2.22) in Theorem 10.2.4, we 
obtain 
By (11.2.3) and (11.2.5) of the common index jump Theorem 11.2.1 and the first 
inequality in (3), we then obtain 
e(xs ) 
2 
2: 2N - (2N - 2s + n) 
(5) 
= (2s - n -
1) + 1. 
Now (4) and (5) yield (2).

15.5 Stability results 
343 
Our following theorem implies the second part of Theorem D in the Introduction 
on the multiplicity of closed characteristics with irrational mean indices. Note that 
by Theorem 4.3, Qn(~) - 1 2:: [~] always holds. 
Theorem 2 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let ~ E H(2n) with n 2:: 2 and 
a E (1,2). Suppose # j(~) < +00. Then there exist at least Qn (~) - 1 elements in 
Vcx:,(~, a) such that each [(r, x)] o/these elements possesses irrational mean index, 
i.e., 
i(x, 1) E R\Q.

Especially such a closed characteristic [( r, x)] must possess at least an irrational 
rotator on U in the sense o/Theorem 9.3.1, i.e., in (9.3.2) there is a term EG!) with 
SM(eRe ) > 0 and e is an irrational multiple 0/2n. 
Proof: Sincen 2:: 2,wehaveQn(~)-I2:: 1. Weusethenotation(4.2)ofVoo(~,a). 
By (11.2.13) and Corollary 9.3.2, the D} defined by (11.1.2) according to Step 1 of 
the proof of Theorem 11.2.1 satisfies 
D} = i (x), 1), 
V j = 1, ... , q. 
(7) 
By the proof of Theorem 4.3, we obtain (N, ml, ... , mq) E Nq+l such that the 
injection map q, of Lemma 3.5 satisfies (1). Thus by Lemma 3.5 and (9.2.25), we 
have 
2mki(xk, 1) - 2m)(x} , 1) 
i(xk, 2mk) - i(x}, 2m}) 
< 0, 
if 1 :::: j < k :::: Qn(~). 
(8) 
Now it suffices to prove that among the first Qn (~) of D}, at most one of them is 
rational. We prove this claim indirectly by assuming 
(9) 
forsomej andksatisfying 1 :::: j < k :::: Qn(~). Then in our choice of (N, ml, ... , mq) 
in the proof of Theorem 11.1.1, we require that N E N further satisfies 
N 
M Di E N, 
for i = j, and k. 
(10) 
Then the closure of the set {{Nv} I N E N satisfies (1O)} is still a closed additive 
subgroupofTh for some hEN. Thus (11.1.22) holds in the j-th andk-thcoordinates 
for infinitely many N, if we choose X to be a vertex of [0, I]h with X} = Xk = O. 
This implies 
I {:n i } 1= 0, 
for i =

Our following theorem studies the existence of multiple elliptic orbits and implies 
the third part of Theorem D in the Introduction. 
Theorem 3 (Y. Long and C. Zhu [LZu3]). Let ~ E 1t(2n) with n > 2 and 
a E (1,2). Suppose # j(~) < +00 and 
(12) 
Then there exist at least two elliptic elements in Voo(~, a). 
In particular by the right-hand side inequality of( 4.3), there are at least two elliptic 
elements in Voo(~, a), provided 
(13) 
Proof: We use the notation (4.2) of Voo(~, a). Let v E Rk be the vector given 
by (11.1.21) according to quantities in (11.2.14)-( 11.2.15) in the proof of 
Theorem 11.2.1. Let A (v) be the set given by Theorem 11.1.2 according to this v. 
We use notations introduced in the proof of Theorem 2. Note that by Theorem 4.3 
and n ::: 2, we have q ::: Qn (~) ::: 2. By Theorem 2, D j E R \ Q holds for at least 
[n /2] integers in {I, ... , q }. Therefore by Theorem 11.1.2, we obtain 
dimA(v) ::: 1, 
0 ¢ A(v). 
(14) 
We continue our proof in two steps. 
Step 1 For a given a E A(v), we define X == x(a) = (ljI(al)' ... ' ljI(ak» by 
(11.1.26). Let(N, ml, ... , mq) E Nq+l be given in the proof for Theorem 4.3 via 
an application of Theorems 11.1.1, 11.1.2, and 11.2.1 with this X = x(a) used in 
their proofs. By the proof of Theorem 4.3, there exists a subset L(a, N) of {l, ... , q} 
such that 
(i) 1 E L(a, N) and # L(a, N) = Qn (~), 
(ii) \II (N) = ([( TI, Xl), 2m d] and Xl is elliptic, 
(iii) for each s = 2, ... , Qn (~), there is a j (s) E L(a, N) \ {I} such that \II(N -
s + 1) = ([Tj(s), Xj(s)], 2m j(s».

By Lemma 3.5, we have 
(15) 
Now assume that there exists only one elliptic element in Voo(h, a). Thus we 
always get the same elliptic element [(rl, XI)] E Voo(h, a) for all a E A(v). 
By (14), we have -a E A(v). 
By the definition (11.1.26), we then have 
xC-a) =1= x(a). Thus by the proof of Theorem 4.3 for this vertex xC-a) we get 
eN, nil, ... , niq) E Nq+l and another subset L(-a, N) of {I, ... , q} such that 
Theorems 4.3, 4.4, 1, and 2, especially the above (i)-(iii) still hold correspondingly.

small neighborhood inside the open ball in V with radius 81/(6M A + 1) and centered

Since dim A (v) :::: 1, by Theorem 11.1.2, A (v) is obtained from V by delet-
ing finitely many proper linear subspaces of V, and so is B(v). Hence B(v) is 
non-empty. 
Now we choose an a E B(v) and j E L(a, N) n L( -a, N) \ {l}. By the claim 
in Step 1, we have alDI = ajDj. By the definitions of a E B(v) and j we have 
Vj = V. 
By (18), the vector {Nv} - X defined by (11.1.22) belongs to V, and thus belongs 
to Vj . Then by the definition (24) of Vj, this implies 
(26) 
By the definition (11.1.21) of v, we then obtain 
By the second equality in (22), this implies miDI = m j D j. Then it contradicts (15)

Corollary 4 Suppose 1: E 'H(4) with # j(1:) = 2. Then both the two closed 
characteristics on 1: are elliptic and belong to Voo (1:, a), one of them possesses 
an irrational mean index and therefore is strongly elliptic. 
Remark 5 Corollary 4 was proved in [Lon 1 8] by using the precise iteration fonnulae 
in Chapter 8. All the other results in Sections 4 and 5 were proved by C. Zhu and the 
author in [LZu3]. 
15.6 Symmetric hypersurfaces 
Suppose 1: E 'Hs(2n), i.e., 1: E 'H(2n) is symmetric with respect to the origin. We 
study the multiplicity and stability of closed characteristics on 1:. 
Our first lemma describes a geometric property of closed characteristics on 1: E 
'Hs(2n). Let O(x) = {x(t) It E R}. We denote by Ha the Hamiltonian function 
corresponding to 1: defined by (0.3). 
Lemma 1 For 1: E 'Hs(2n), a E (1,2), and (r, x) E .:J(1:, a), we have (r, -x) E 
.:J(1:, a). IjO(x) n O( -x) =I- 0, it must hold that 
x(t) = -x (t + ~), 
"It E R. 
(1) 
Proof: Since 1: = -1:, 
Ha(x) = Ha(-x), 
(2) 
H~(x) = -H~(-x), 
(3) 
(4) 
So for any (r, x) E .:J(1:, a), it holds that (r, -x) E .:J(1:, a). 
If O(x) n O( -x) =I- 0, there exist s] and S2 E [0, r] such thatx(s)) = -X(S2)' By 
the fact x(r) = x(O) =I- 0 and x(t) =I- 0 for any t E R, we have S2 -
S1 =I- 0, and ±r. 
Since X(S1 + t) and -X(S2 + t) satisfy the same Hamiltonian system 
y = JH~(y), 
by the uniqueness theorem for initial value problems of ordinary differential equations, 
we obtain X(Sl + t) = -X(S2 + t) and hence 
x(t) = X (2(S2 - s)) + t), 
"It E R. 
Since r is the minimal period of x, we have 2(S2 -

Then the associated symplectic path Yx of (r, x) satisfies 
Yx (t +~) = yx(t)yx (~), "It E [o,~]. 
(5) 
From this lemma, the orbits of closed characteristics are classified into two families: 
symmetric ones satisfying O(x) n O( -x) f. 0, and non-symmetric ones satisfying 
O(x) n 0(-x) = 0. Now we can give the proof of the third part of Theorem C in 
the Introduction of this book. 
Theorem 2 (C. Liu, Y. Long, and C. Zhu [LLZl]). For any ~ E Hs (2n), 
# j(~) ::: n. 
(6) 
Proof: It suffices to consider the case # j(~) < +00. By (2) and (3), we have 
(r, -x) E .:J(~, a) if (r, x) E .:J(~, a). Note that we have 
(i(Xk, m), v(xk, m)) = (i(-xk, m), v(-xk, m)), 
By Lemma 1, we can denote the elements in j(~, a) by 
"1m EN. 
{[(rj, xj)]li = 1, ... , p} U {[(rk, xd]' [(rk, -xk)]lk = P + 1, ... , p + q}, 
(7) 
where O(Xj) = O(-Xj) for i = 1, ... , p, and O(Xk) n O(-Xk) = 0 for k = 
p+l, ... ,p+q. 
By Lemma 3.5, we get an injection map \II = \II(~, a) : N -+ j(~, a) x N. 
Note that (rk, Xk) and (rk, -Xk) have the same index intervals. Thus by Lemma 3.5 
we can further require that 
1m (\II) C {[(rk, xd] I k = 1, ... , p + q} x N. 
Set i(k, m) = i(xk, m) and v(k, m) = V(Xk, m). By (3.10) we have f(xk, 1) > 2 
for k = 1, ... , p + q. Applying the common index jump Theorem 11.2.1 to the 
associated symplectic paths of 
(rl, xd, ... , (rp+q, x p+q), (2rp+l, X~+I)' ... ' (2rp+q, x;+q), 
we get infinitely many (N, ml, ... , m p+2q) E NP+2q+1 such that

We continue our proof in two steps and study the symmetric and non-symmetric 
orbits separately. By our following Claims 1 and 3, we then obtain upper bounds for 
the numbers of integers contained in the sets Sl and S2 respectively, which yields our 
Theorem 2. 
Step 1 Study on symmetric orbits. 
We need 
Claim 1 # Sl :s p. 
Since S] corresponds to those symmetric characteristics, our proof of Claim 1 
depends on the index increasing estimates contained in the following two lemmas.

Proof: By Lemma 1, (T, x) satisfies (1), i.e., it is T /2-antiperiodic. Therefore 
H:;(x(t» is T/2-periodic by (4). Let l/! = YXI[O,T/2], M = Yx(T), and G = Yx(T/2). 
Then we have YXI[O,T] = l/!2, M = G2, and 
i(x, 1) + 2S+(x) - vex, 1) = i(yx, 1) + 2St(I) - v(Yx, 1) 
= i(l/!, 2) + 2S~2(I) - vel/!, 2)

where in the last step we used Lemma 3.

Now we can give 
The proof of Claim 1: In fact, by the definition (17) of Sl, (7)and(I6), \II(N -s+I) = 
([(rk(s), Xk(s»], m(s» must be symmetric whenk(s) :::; p. We further claim thatm(s) 
is uniquely determined by k(s) if k(s) :s p. More precisely we have 

15.6 Symmetric hypersuifaces 
351 
Claim 2 m(s) = 2mk(s) when k(s) S p. 
In fact, by the definition of 'lI and (3.5) we have 
i(k(s),m(s)) S 2(N-s+1)-2+n 
= 2N - 2s + n 
(23) 
S i(k(s ), m(s)) + v(k(s), m(s)) - 1. 
So from i(k(s), 1) :::: n we have 
i(k(s),m(s» S 2N-2s+n 
< 2N+n 
S 2N + i(k(s), 1) 
= i(k(s), 2mk(s) + 1), 
(24) 
for every s = 1, ... , n, where we have used (8) in the last equality. Note that the 
proofs of (23) and (24) do not depend on the condition k(s) S p. 
By (9), Lemma 4, and the right-hand side of (23), if k(s) s p we have 
i(k(s), 2mk(s) -
1) + v(k(s), 2mk(s) - 1) 
= 2N - (i(k(s), 1) +2S+(Xk(s») - v(k(s), 1» 
s 2N-n 
S 2N - 2s +n 
S i(k(s), m(s» + v(k(s), m(s» - 1. 
Thus by Lemma 3.2, (24), and (25) we have 
2mk(s) - 1 < m(s) < 2mk(s) + 1, 
for k(s) s p. 
This proves our Claim 2. 
By Claim 2, we obtain especially: 
'lI(N - s + 1) = ([(rk(s) , Xk(s»], 2mk(s»), 
Then by the injectivity of the map 'lI, it induces another injection 
'lI1 : N -
S1 + 1 -+ {I, .. . , pl. 
Therefore we obtain Claim 1. 
Step 2 Study on non-symmetric orbits. 
We need 
Claim 3 # S2 S 2q. 
(25)

Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
In fact, by the definition (17) of S2, (7) and (16), IJI(N - s + 1) = ([(rk(s) , Xk(s»)), 
m(s» must be non-symmetric when s E S2, i.e., p < k(s) :::: p + q. Note that in this 
case, [(rk(s) , Xk(s»] and [( rk(s) , -Xk(s»] are different closed characteristics possessing 
the same iterated index sequences and non-intersecting orbits. Our following claim 
studies a special property of such characteristics. 
Claim 4 mk = 2mk+q for p < k :::: p + q. 
In fact, by (10), (13), and Lemma 3, for k = p + 1, ... , p + q we have 
i(k,2mk) 2: 2N - n 
2: 2N - (i(k, 2) + 2s+(xl) - v(k, 2» 
= i(k,4mk+q - 2) + v(k, 4mk+q - 2) 
> i(k,4mk+q - 2). 
By (11), (12), (1.18) and Lemma 3.2, we have 
i(k,2mk) < i(k, 2mk) + v(k, 2md 
:::: 2N+n 
:::: 2N + i(k, 2) 
= i(k, 4mk+q + 2). 
By (3.6) of Lemma 3.2, we then obtain 
Therefore Claim 4 holds. 
To continue our proof of Claim 3, by Claim 4 we obtain 
(26) 
if p < k(s) :::: p + q, i.e., s E S2. By (26), (13), Lemma 3, and the right-hand side 
of (23), we then have 
i(k(s), 2mk(s) - 2) + v(k(s), 2mk(s) - 2) 
= i(k(s), 4mk(s)+q - 2) + v(k(s), 4mk(s)+q - 2) 
= 2N - (i(k(s), 2) + 2s+(xl(s» - v(k(s), 2» 
:::: 2N-n 
:::: 2N - 2s +n 
:::: i(k(s), m(s» + v(k(s), m(s» - 1. 
Thus by (3.6) and (3.8) of Lemma 3.2, (27), and (24), we obtain 
2mk(s) - 2 < m(s) < 2mk(s) + 1, 
for p < k(s) :::: p + q. 
(27) 

15.6 Symmetric hypersu1aces 
Hence 
m(s) E {2mk(s) -
1, 2mk(s)}' 
if p < k(s) :s p + q. 
Especially this yields that for any So and s E S2, if k(s) = k(so), then 
m(s) E {2mk(s) -
1, 2mk(s)} = {2mk(so) -
1, 2mk(so)}. 
Thus by the injectivity of the map \II we obtain 
#{s E S21 k(s) = k(so)} :s 2. 
This proves Claim 3. 
Step 3 Completion of the proof of Theorem 2. 
Now by Claims 1 and 3 we obtain 
This completes the proof.

Next we present a stability theorem for closed characteristics on I:. E lis(2n). 
Theorem 5 (G.F. Dell' Antonio, B. D'Onofrio, and I. Ekeland [DDEl]). For any 
I:. E lis (2n), there exists at least one elliptic closed characteristic on I:.. 
Proof: The proof is similar to those in the previous sections. We are rather sketchy 
here. 
Fix I:. E lis(2n). To solve the given energy problem (0.4)-(0.6), we consider the 
fixed period problem with a E (1, 2) and Ha given by (0.3), 
For 1 < a < 2, let 
{ x(t) = J H~(x(t», 
x(l/2) = -x(O). 
Vt E R, 
(31) 
Ea = {u E Lal(a-l) (R/ (~z) , R2n) I u(t + 1/2) = -U(t)} . 
(32) 
The Clarke-Ekeland dual action functional fa : Ea ---+ R is defined by 
{1/2{I 
} 
fa(u) = 10 
"2 Ju . TIu + H;(-Ju) dt. 
(33) 

354 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersuifaces 
Then we obtain a global minimal point u of fa on Ea. This u corresponds to a 
solution x of the problem (0.4)-(0.6). 
The linearized Hamiltonian system of (31) yields 
{ y(t) = J H:;(x(t))y(t), 
y(I/2) = -y(O). 
(34) 
Denote the fundamental solution of (34) by y . Then y E Pl/2 (2n) and the singular 
hypersurface in Sp(2n) for the definition of the index corresponding to (34) is given 
by w = -1. Then using our notation we obtain for this global minimum point x that 
LI(Y) = O. 
(35) 
On the other hand, by the convexity of Ha and our discussion in Section 1, we have 
(36) 
for any sufficiently small E > O. By (35), (36) and formula (9.3.3), the total number 
of eigenvalues of y(1/2) on the upper semi-circle in U is at least n. Thus the solution 
x is elliptic.

Remark 6 Theorem 2 was proved by C. Liu, C. Zhu, and the author in the 
recent paper [LLZI]. Here the proof is rewritten to make it easier to understand. 
Theorem 5 was proved by G.F. Dell' Antonio, B. D'Onofrio, and I. Ekeland in [DDE1] 
of 1992. 
15.7 Notes and comments 
Since 1: E H(2n) is compact smooth and orientable, the flow of the ordinary dif-
ferential equation system (0.1) on 1: is always defined all the time. But it is com-
pletely non-trivial to say more about the periodic boundary value problem (0.1). 
We give next a brief historical survey on the multiplicity and stability problems of 
(0.1). We also give a brief introduction to the Weinstein conjecture which is closely 
related to the material of this chapter. Then we propose some open problems in 
this area. 
I 
Existence and multiplicity 
As mentioned on page 235 of [Eke3], the most famous long-standing conjecture on 
(0.1) is 
Conjecture 1 # j(1:) ::: n for any 1: E H(2n). 
It seems that the first study of this problem was started by A.M. Liapunov in [Lia1] 
of 1892 and 1. Hom in [Horl] of 1903. It is surprising enough that more than one

hundred years ago, they were able to prove the following great result for (0.1) in the 
local sense: Suppose H : R 2n ---+ R is analytic, (J (J HI! (0)) = {±J=Twl,"" 
±J=Twn} are purely imaginary, and satisfy :i rf. Z for all i -:f=. j. Then there exists 
] 
EO > 0 so small that 
(1) 
This deep result was greatly improved by A. Weinstein in [Wei2] of 1973. He 
was able to prove that for H E c2(R2n, R), if HI!(O) is positive definite, then there 
exists EO > 0 small such that (1) still holds. Weinstein's theorem then was further 
generalized by 1. Moser in [Mos5] of 1976 to more general systems and by T. Bartsch 
in [Barl] of 1997 to non-convex cases for the local problem. 
In the full generality of the Conjecture 1, i.e., the problem (0.1) in the global 
sense, an exciting breakthrough was made by P. Rabinowitz in [Rab2] (for I; being 
star-shaped) and A. Weinstein in [Wei5] of 1978 independently. They proved 
# j(I;) ~ 1, 
VI; E H(2n). 
(2) 
Here in his pioneering work, P. Rabinowitz first introduced the variational method to 
study the problem (0.1), which stimulated great interest and much research on this 
problem. 
Among the great number of papers on this problem, 1. Ekeland introduced his 
Morse-type index theory for convex Hamiltonian systems, and made profound studies 
on Conjecture 1. 1. Ekeland-L. Lassoued in [ELal] and 1. Ekeland-H.Hofer in [EkH2] 
of 1987, and A. Szulkin in [Szu1] of 1988 proved the multiplicity result 
# j(I;) ~ 2, 
VI; E H(2n) with n ~ 2. 
(3) 
Because it is so difficult to completely answer Conjecture 1, it is natural to study the 
multiplicity of closed characteristics on special subclasses of H (2n) under additional 
conditions. Following studies for closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds, the 
pinching condition is introduced to the study of problem (0.1). We say I; E H(2n) 
is b-pinched, if there exist two balls Br and B R with radius rand R respectively 
satisfying 
Br C C C BR 
and R/r < b, 
where C is the convex domain bounded by I;. In [EkLl] of 1980, 1. Ekeland and 
I.M. Lasry proved 
# j(I;) ~ n, 
if I; E H(2n) is h-pinched. 
(4) 
A different proof of this result can be found in [Hofl] of H. Hofer of 1982. In [AmM2] 
of 1982, A. Ambrosseti and G. Mancini further proved 
# -
[n ] 
:1(I;) ~ k _ 1 ' 
if I; E H(2n) is .Jk-pinched, 
(5) 
where as usual [a] = max{k E Z I k :S a} for any a E R. 

356 
15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
When :E is symmetric to the origin, a result which is slightly better than (4) was 
obtained by M. Girardi in [Girl] of 1984, where he proved 
# j(:E) ~ n, 
if:E E Hs(2n) is J3-pinched. 
(6) 
In [BLMRl] of 1985, H. Berestycki, J.M. Lasry, G. Mancini, and B. Ruf generalized 
(4) to (star-shaped hypersurfaces under) pinching conditions in tenus of ellipsoids. 
Using a theorem in [Fral] of J. Franks, in [HWZl] of 1998, H. Hofer, K. Wysocki, 
and E. Zehnder further improved (3) when n = 2 to 
# jc'£,) = 2 or + 00, 
'v':E E H(4). 
(7) 
Another interesting result proved by I. Ekeland in [Eke2] of 1986 and [Eke3] 
of 1990 is the following: # j(:E) = +00 holds generically for :E E H(2n) in 
C P -topology with 3 :s p :s +00. 
Then Theorems 4.3 and 4.4 were proved in [LZu3] of Y. Long and C. Zhu, and 
Theorem 6.2 by C. Liu, Y. Long, and C. Zhu in [LLZl] recently. 
Note that one can construct a path yEP) (6) (cf. the first manuscript of [LZu3], 
Nankai Inst. of Math. Preprint No. 1999-M-002) such that y is the fundamental 
solution of a linear Hamiltonian system (1.1) with s = 1 satisfying (81) and (B2), 
y(1) = N) (1, 1)<>N) (1, _1)02, i(y, I) = 3. Especially S;(I)(I) = 1 and 
i(y, 1) + 2S;(I)(I) - v(y, 1) + 3 = 5 < 6. 
This linear example is not a counterexample to the above Conjecture 1 on the nonlinear 
problem, but it may suggest that the lower bound G] + 1 of Qn(:E) in (0.0.17) of 
Theorem C in the Introduction of the book as well as (4.3) of the above Theorem 4.3 
may not be further improved in general. 
II Stability 
We are interested in the ellipticity of closed characteristic (T, x) on a given :E E 
H(2n). On this stability problem, the following is the most important long-standing 
conjecture (cf. p.235 of [Eke3]): 
Conjecture 2 There exists an elliptic closed characteristic on any :E E H(2n). 
The first result on this topic in the global sense seems to be that proved by I. Ekeland 
in [Eke2] of 1986: 
There exists at least one elliptic element in .J (:E, a), if:E E H(2n) is ,J2-pinched. 
In [Eke2] of I. Ekeland in 1986 and [LonI4] of the author in 1998, the following 
alternative result for any :E E H(2n) was proved: either there exist infinitely many 
geometrically distinct hyperbolic closed characteristics [(Tj, x j)] for j E N with their 
minimal periods Tj ~ +00, or there exists a non-hyperbolic closed characteristic 
on :E. Especially, this implies that there exists at least one non-hyperbolic closed 
characteristic on :E, if# j(:E) < +00. 

15.7 Notes and comments 
357 
Note that the above remarkable Theorem 6.5 of G.F. Dell' Antonio, B. D'Onofrio, 
and I. Ekeland in [DDE1] of 1992 solved Conjecture 2 whenever ~ is symmetric. 
Considering the above mentioned result (7) of Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder, in the 
recent [LonI8] based upon the precise iteration formulae developed there, the author 
proved that both the closed characteristics are elliptic if ~ E 7t(4) and # j(~) = 2. 
Then in the recent [LZu3] of Y. Long and C. Zhu, Theorems 5.1-5.3, especially 
Theorem D in the Introduction were further proved. 
III The Weinstein conjecture 
Based on the results of [Wei5] and [Rab2], A. Weinstein proposed the following 
conjecture in [Wei6]: On every contact hypersuiface ~ in a symplectic manifold 
(M, ev), there exists at least one closed characteristic provided H I (M) = O. Here a 
hypersurface ~ C M is of contact type, if it is compact, orientable, and there exists 
a I-form a on ~ such that da = rev, and a(~) i= 0 for 0 i= ~ E LE, where 
j : ~ -+ M is the inclusion map, and LE is the canonical bundle of ~ defined by 
A closed characteristic of ~ is an embedded circle P C ~ satisfying 
TP=LElp· 
A compact smooth hypersurface ~ in R 2n is star-shaped, if there exists one point 
o located inside the open set enclosed by ~ such that the ray from 0 to any point 
x E ~ intersects ~ at the point x only and transversally. Note that every hypersurface 
in 7t(2n) is star-shaped. Every compact smooth star-shaped hypersurface in R2n is 
of contact type. 
Note that in [Viti] of 1987, C. Viterbo proved the Weinstein conjecture for every 
contact hypersurface ~ in R2n without the assumption Hl(~) = O. Then H. Hofer 
and E. Zehnder gave a rather simple proof for this result in [HoZ1] of 1987. Further 
results on this conjecture can be found in [FHV1], [HoVl], [HoZ2], [Marl], and 
[LiT2]. 
For any compact smooth star-shaped hypersurface ~ in R 2n , as we have men-
tioned, P. Rabinowitz in [Rab2] of 1978 proved the existence of at least one closed 
characteristic, i.e., # j(~) 2: 1. In [BLMR1] of 1985, H. Berestycki, I.-P. Lasry, 
G. Mancini, and B. Ruf proved # j(~) 2: n provided ~ is suitably pinched by two 
ellipsoids. Note that very recently in [HuLl], Xijun Hu and the author proved the 
following result: For any smooth compact star-shaped hypersuiface ~ in R 2n, sup-
pose every closed characteristic (r, x) E .J(~) is completely non-degenerate, i.e., 
v(x,m) = Oforallm EN. Then, 
if n 2: 2. 
In [LL02] of 1999, c. Liu and the author obtained some partial results for non-
hyperbolic closed characteristics on star-shaped hypersurfaces in R2n.

15 Closed characteristics on convex hypersurfaces 
To the author's knowledge, no mUltiplicity and stability results are known so far 
for closed characteristics on general contact type hypersurfaces. 
IV Open problems 
The aim of the study on the problem (0.1) is threefold. The first aim is to completely 
understand the structure of the set of closed characteristics on any given hypersurface 
~ E H(2n) , and then to further understand the characteristic flow on ~. The second 
aim is to understand the structure of the set H (2n). The third is to use it as the most 
typical example in the study of the closed orbits of the Reeb vector field on any general 
contact manifold. 
Based on our Theorem C in the Introduction, as well as Theorems 4.3, 4.4 and 6.2 
in this chapter, earlier results mentioned above, and other observations, we suspect 
that the following conjecture holds: 
Conjecture A 
{# j (~) I ~ E H(2n)} = {k E N I [~] + 1 ::'S k ::'S n} U {+oo}. 
Here we would also like to remind the readers of the following reduced version of 
Conjecture 2 based on our Theorem 5.1: 
Conjecture B There exists at least an elliptic closed characteristic on any ~ E H (2n) 
with # j(~) = +00. 
More generally, it is interesting to know the global topological structure of the set 
j(~) for any ~ E H(2n). 
It is an interesting problem to clarify the relation between the contact (or corre-
sponding symplectic) invariants of the given contact manifold and the number of 
periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field on it. Such a relation should include results 
on the case of hypersurfaces in H(2n), especially our Theorems 4.3, 4.4, and 6.2 in 
Sections 4 and 6 as special cases. It is interesting to know the relation between our 
shape invariant Qn(~) and the possible topological invariants. For this problem, we 
refer the readers to the recent exciting work [LiT2] of G. Liu and G. Tian. 
As pointed out in [LonI8], the study of the stability of closed characteristics is 
related to the following conjectures on primes in number theory. 
Given any pEN, we define an integer pair set 
yep) = {(pn -1, pn + 1) In EN}. 
Conjecture C For any pEN, the set yep) contains infinitely many prime number 
pairs. 
Note that this is a slight general version of the conjecture on twin primes. 

15.7 Notes and comments 
359 
Given any cp E [0, 1] \ Q, we define an integer set 
Z(cp) = N \ {2n + 2[ncp] + 11 n EN}. 
Conjecture D For any cp E [0,1]\ Q, the set Z(cp) contains infinitely many prime 
numbers. 
It is even more interesting if one can develop dynamical system studies to these 
conjectures on prime numbers.
