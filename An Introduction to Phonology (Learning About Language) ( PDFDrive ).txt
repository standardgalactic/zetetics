Preface 
This book is a hands-on introduction to PHONOLOGY 
for the absolute novice. Probably the best way to learn 
about phonology, i.e. to learn how speech sounds are used 
to convey meaning, is to do phonological analysis and 
confront theoretical issues as they get thrown up by the 
data. 
With this in mind, this book has been written not only 
with exercises at the end of each chapter, but also with in-
text problems and tasks which are separated from the 
discussion by a line drawn across the page. You should 
always attempt these problems before reading on. They are 
an integral part of the discussion. Suggested answers are 
included within each chapter. Answers to end of chapter 
exercises will be found at the end of the book. 
Some remarks on presentation: technical terms are 
commented on and highlighted using capital letters when 
they are introduced for the first time or when it is important 
to emphasise them. The common convention of using an 
asterisk to indicate impossible or wrong forms is also 
observed (e.g. *tleg is 'starred' to show that it is not a poss-
ible word in English). Examples discussed in the text are 
written in italics. 
The model of phonology which I introduce you to is 
called GENERATIVE PHONOLOGY. It was given its 
first full and authoritative statement in Chomsky and 
Halle's 1968 book The Sound Pattern of English. As we shall 
see, since then it has moved on in various directions. In the 
next few paragraphs the objectives of this theory are 
explained. 
Generative phonology is part of the theory of language 
called GENERATIVE GRAMMAR which has been devel-

x 
Preface 
oped by Chomsky and his collaborators. The basic goal of 
generative grammar is to explore and understand the nature 
of linguistic knowledge. It seeks answers to questions like: 
what does knowing a language entail? How is linguistic 
knowledge acquired by infants? Are there any properties of 
language that are universal, i.e. is there such a thing as 
'Universal Grammar'? 
Chomsky believes that the answer to the last question, 
which he thinks holds the key to the other questions, is 'yes' 
and goes on to argue that Universal Grammar has a 
biological basis. Biologically determined characteristics of 
the brain pre-dispose humans to acquire grammars with 
certain properties. But this raises further questions: what are 
the properties of Universal Grammar? In attempting to 
answer this question, generative linguists have developed 
principles and posited rules of the kind we shall explore. 
They form part of their model of Universal Grammar. 
Like other linguists, generative linguists know that 
some aspects of language are not universal. But still they 
raise the question whether some non-universal properties of 
language fall into certain well defined parameters. Are there 
any pre-set limits within 
which differences 
between 
languages occur? If the answer is 'yes' what are these limits 
and why do they exist? These are some of the main issues 
which this book addresses. 
Besides being concerned with general patterns of 
language structure, linguistic theory must provide us with 
the tools for describing those idiosyncratic properties which 
are peculiar to a particular language. For instance, linguistic 
theory should enable us to write a grammar for English 
showing that the final / consonant of chief is pronounced / 
when the plural -s ending is present but the final / of thief 
is pronounced v when the same plural ending is present. 
The grammar of a language can be regarded as a model 
of the COMPETENCE (i.e. inexplicit knowledge of rules) 
that 
underlies 
a native 
speaker's 
overt 
linguistic 
PERFORMANCE 
as a speaker-hearer. 
We need 
to 
distinguish between the knowledge speakers have and the 
manner in which they put that knowledge to use in concrete 
situations as, sometimes, there is a difference between what 
one knows to be correct and what one actually says. This 
may be due to a number of factors such as slips of the 

Preface 
xi 
tongue or memory 
lapses. Linguistics 
is 
primarily 
concerned with linguistic competence (knowledge) rather 
than performance (use). This book is primarily concerned 
with PHONOLOGICAL COMPETENCE. 
Interestingly, knowing a language, say English, is not 
merely a matter of learning by rote a very large number of 
sentences. Native speakers of a language can always produce 
and understand completely new sentences which they have 
not previously encountered. No list, however long, could 
contain all the potential sentences of a language. Therefore 
a grammar of a language cannot be simply a list of words 
and sentences of that language. In view of this, Chomsky 
proposes that a grammar of a language should be a gener-
ative algebraic system of formal, explicit rules that enum-
erates a non-finite number of well-formed sentences and 
assigns to each one of them a correct analysis of its 
structure. 
The motivation for using rules to account for the fact 
that there is no limit to the number of possible sentences 
that a language can contain is obvious: speakers produce and 
understand sentences using rules. They do not merely 
memorise long lists of sentences. However, the reasons for 
assuming that there are rules which underlie speakers' 
knowledge of the sound system of their language are 
perhaps less obvious, given the fact that a language only 
uses a finite set of sounds to form words. 
Just a little reflection is enough to show that the sound 
system is also rule governed. Determine which of the 
following nonsense words (which you are probably seeing 
for the first time) is a possible English word: tpat, bender, 
bintlement and zvetsin. You no doubt have chosen bintlement 
as the only potential English word. This is because you 
know that the consonant sequences tp, Is and zv which 
occur in the other 'words' are not permitted at the begin-
ning of an English word. On the other hand, all the 
sequences of sounds in bintlement are allowed by the rules 
of English phonology. You might indeed be tempted to 
look up bintlement in a good English dictionary - but not the 
other nonsense words. 
The implicit knowledge of linguistic rules that speakers 
have is probably 
modular. 
Generative linguists have 
proposed that it can be represented using a model with a 

xii 
Preface 
number of components which represent semantic knowl-
edge, syntactic knowledge, knowledge of sound structure, 
and so on. 
Over the years, various proposals have been made 
regarding the precise organisation and content of a gener-
ative grammar. You are not expected to have any prior 
knowledge of these theories. 
Nothing is presupposed. 
Essential aspects of the theory will be introduced, where 
necessary.

the general theory of language which we shall be using:

The SYNTACTIC C O M P O N E N T consists of the 
base sub-component and the transformational rules. The 
PHRASE S T R U C T U R E (PS) rules and the LEXICON 
found in the base sub-component of the grammar generate 
the INITIAL PHRASE MARKER (DEEP STRUCTURE) 
of a sentence. The lexicon lists the words of the language, 
together with their syntactic and phonological properties 

Preface 
xiii 
and the PS rules define the constituent structure (i.e. the 
structure of noun phrases, verb phrases etc.) and how they 
interact with each other. The initial phrase marker enters 
the transformational component where it may be modified 
by various transformational 
rules which 
move 
around 
constituents. This is done to relate sentences like Money is 
what I need and What I need is money. The output of the 
syntactic component is the SURFACE STRUCTURE. 
Surface structures are the input to rules of LOGICAL 
FORM and SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION. The rules 
of logical form explain, for example, why to pay in the 
sentence Jane ordered Bill to pay is understood to mean that 
Bill is the one that was expected to pay while in Jane prom-
ised Bill to pay it is Jane who is expected to pay. 
Rules of semantic interpretation are used, for instance 
to account for logical relations like entailment. A sentence 
like ' The Mayor of Lancaster switched on the Christmas lights last 
year' entails that there were Christmas lights last year. It 
would be contradictory to utter that sentence and continue 
'but there were no Christmas lights last year because of budget 
cuts'. 
P H O N O L O G I C A L RULES also apply to the surface 
structure 
and 
assign 
it 
a 
P H O N E T I C 
REPRESEN-
T A T I O N (i.e. show how it is pronounced). It is this final 
aspect of the grammar that we are mainly concerned with 
in this book. 
This book is a simple, practical introduction to phon-
ology within the model of generative phonology as it has 
evolved during the last twenty years or so. While in the 
early years the emphasis was on making explicit 
the 
relationship between underlying and surface phonological 
representations by investigating the nature of formal phono-
logical rules, the ways in which rules interact and the 
distance between underlying and surface representations in 
phonology, lately the focus has shifted to scrutinising the 
nature of phonological representations themselves and the 
relationship between phonology and other components of 
the grammar. 
This shift in focus is reflected in the contents of this 
book. After a brief introduction to articulatory phonetics, 
the opening chapters deal with distinctiveness, 'naturalness', 
the relationship between levels of phonological represen-

xiv 
Preface 
tation and rule interaction. These were the main issues 
explored in the 1960s and 1970s. 
However, the latter part of the book is devoted to 
topics of current interest. One major trend in generative 
phonology today involves several 'non-linear' approaches 
to the nature of phonological representations. It is being 
developed through an examination of the nature of sound 
'segments', syllable, tone, stress, and intonation in numerous 
languages. The other major current trend focuses on the 
relationship between phonology and other components of 
the grammar such as the lexicon, morphology and syntax. 
These two trends are complementary. 
The exclusive concentration on generative phonology 
should not be taken as evidence of a belief on my part that 
nothing of value has been said about phonology in the other 
frameworks. 
Occassionally the contributions of other 
schools are mentioned in a footnote. But I have restricted 
the exposition to generative phonology for two reasons. In 
my experience, for the beginning student it is more bewil-
dering than enlightening to be presented with several 
competing theoretical positions, with their different the-
oretical concepts, analytical techniques and nomenclature. 
There is virtue in introducing students initially to one 
coherent theoretical' approach. The question that then arises 
is: which approach?

present trends in phonology there are many books which 
you can turn to. If you wish to acquaint yourself with the

the generations of students who were subjected to earlier 
drafts of the book for the feedback I got from them. 
In writing this book I have benefited immensely from 
the help of Professor Geoffrey Sampson. Very special 
thanks also go to my editors and colleagues Mr. Mick Short 
and Professor Geoffrey Leech whose critical comments and 
suggestions have made this a better book than it would 
otherwise have been. Those others who over the years have 
taught me directly or indirectly something about phonology 
deserve a special mention. Their scholarship is reflected in 
the theory presented here as well as in the data from the 
dozens of languages cited. And finally, I am grateful for the 
encouragement of my wife Janet during the long gestation 
of this book.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction to phonetics 
1.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this book is to introduce you to the study 
of PHONOLOGY. Phonology is the branch of linguistics 
which investigates the ways in which sounds are used 
systematically in different languages to form words and 
utterances. 
In order to understand phonology, one must have a 
grasp of the basic concepts of PHONETICS, the study of 
the inventory of all SPEECH SOUNDS which humans are 
capable of producing. The term speech sound has been used 
advisedly since not all noises which we are capable of 
producing with our vocal apparatus are employed in speech: 
we can all snore; we can all cough and hiccup; we can all 
sneeze and we can all gnash our teeth. However, no 
linguist, has yet discovered a community that has a 
language in which noises produced by any one of these 
mechanisms are used to form words. It is almost certain that 
no such speech community exists. One reason for this is the 
fact 
that 
there are obvious 
disadvantages 
in 
letting 
communication depend on involuntary noises like hiccups 
which speakers cannot start and stop at will. Other methods 
like the gnashing of teeth may be easy to control, but have 
their drawbacks - the wear and tear which gnashing of teeth 
would entail must have ruled out that method. I am using 
these examples to underscore the point that speech sounds 
form a small subset of all the noises which humans can 
produce with their vocal apparatus. It is this subset that 
phoneticians focus on. 
The study of speech sounds can be approached from 

2 
Introduction to phonetics 
various angles. These are reflected by the three major 
branches of phonetics: 
(a) ACOUSTIC PHONETICS: the study of the physical 
properties of speech sounds using laboratory instruments; 
(b) AUDITORY PHONETICS: the study of speech 
perception; 
(c) ARTICULATORY PHONETICS: the study of speech 
production. 
1.2 The production of speech 
It is articulatory phonetics that we shall concentrate on here 
because it is the branch of phonetics on which most phono-
logical theories have been based in the past. 
1.2.1 The production of consonants 
Speech sounds are produced by interfering in some way 
with a body of moving air. Phoneticians use the term AIR-
STREAM MECHANISM to describe a body of moving air 
used in speech production. It is important to describe how 
the air is set in motion and the direction in which it travels 
because that makes a difference in the sound produced. The 
commonest airstream mechanism used in the world's 
languages (and the only one found in English) is the 
PULMONIC EGRESSIVE mechanism. When this mech-
anism is employed, air is expelled from the lungs, up the 
windpipe and gets out through the mouth, or through the 
nose, or through both. 
There exist other airstream mechanisms, but we shall 
postpone discussion of these until Chapter 3. We shall 
provisionally assume that all speech sounds are made with 
air pushed from the lungs up the WIND PIPE (also called 
the TRACHEA, more technically). Continuing its outward 
journey, the air reaches the LARYNX (or voice box - that 
cartilaginous membrane at the top of the windpipe which 
is called the Adam's apple in everyday language). Once in 
the larynx, the air must pass through the GLOTTIS. This 
is the space between the vocal cords. If the vocal cords are 
apart, i.e. if the glottis is open, the air escapes unimpeded. 
Sounds produced in this way are said to be VOICELESS. 

The production of speech 
3 
If, on the other hand, the vocal cords are very close 
together, the air will blow them apart as it forces its way 
through. In doing so, it will make them vibrate, producing 
a VOICED sound. 
You can perform a little experiment to determine for 
yourself whether a given sound is voiced or voiceless. Say 
[ffffj and then [vvvv] with two fingers held firmly on your 
larynx. Repeat this four times. What do you observe? 
Now say [ffffvvvvffffvvvv] 
this time with your index 
fingers in your ears. What do you observe? 
In the first experiment, you should be able to feel your 
fingers vibrating slightly when you say [vvvv] but not 
when you say [ffffj. And in the second experiment, you 
should be able to hear a low buzzing noise in your head 
when you produce [vvvv], but not when you produce [ffffj. 
The noise that causes the vibration in your larynx which 
you feel with your fingers as well as the low buzzing sound 
which you feel when you have fingers in your ears is called 
VOICING. 
Voicing is linguistically important. The 
difference 
between voiced and voiceless sounds is functional. In many 
languages, English included, as you can see in [1.1], there 
are many consonants which come in pairs, with the two 
sounds in question differing in voicing: 
A 
pull 
ten 
cot 
fast 
sink 
chew 
B 
bull 
den 
got 
vast 
zinc 
Jew 
The initial consonant of the words in column A is 
voiceless while the initial consonant of the words in column 
B is voiced. 
Find five more words which begin with voiceless and 
voiced consonants respectively.

larynx 
The term VOCAL T R A C T is used to refer to the air 
passages which the air enters on leaving the larynx. As you 
can see in the figure in [1.2], the vocal tract has two parts: 
the ORAL TRACT, which is the air passage offered by the 
mouth and the NASAL TRACT, which is the air passage 
provided by the nose. 
Consonants are produced by obstructing in some way 
the flow of air through the vocal tract. We can identify the 
PLACE (or POINT) where the obstruction takes place, and 
the organs involved. The parts of the oral tract such as the 
tongue and lips which can be used to form speech sounds 
are called ARTICULATORS. A list of places of articulation 
is given in [1.3] together with the phonetic 
symbols 
representing some of the sounds made at each place. 
As you read through [1.3] you should say aloud the 
words in the illustrative examples and observe how you use 
the articulators to produce each sound. Next, you should 
find examples of your own of each sound. The examples 
can come from any language you know. If you are uncer-
tain about the terminology, consult [1.2].

Besides describing the place where the obstruction 
occurs in the production of a consonant, it is also essential 

6 
Introduction to phonetics 
to consider the MANNER OF ARTICULATION, i.e. the 
nature and extent of the obstruction involved because 
sounds made at the same place of articulation - and which 
are both voiced or voiceless, as the case may be - can still 
differ depending on the manner in which the airstream is 
modified. Take these words, which all begin with VOICED 
ALVEOLAR consonants: dine, nine, line and Rhine. Not 
only do they sound different, they also mean different 
things. The difference lies in the manner of articulation of 
their initial consonants. 
In [1.4] below a brief survey of manners of articulation 
is given, together with English examples. 
[1.4] STOP: The articulators come together 
and 
completely cut off the flow of air momentarily, 
then they separate abruptly. Examples: pin bin 
tin din kilt gilt. 
Stops like [ p b t d k g ] which are made with 
the pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism 
(as the speaker breathes out through the mouth) 
are called PLOSIVES. Sounds like [m n], as we 
shall see presently, are also stops but they are 
not plosives; they differ from plosives in that 
they are formed by completely blocking off the 
airstream in the mouth while at the same time 
allowing it to escape through the nose. 
AFFRICATE: In the production of an affricate, 
first 
the 
articulators 
come 
together 
and 
completely cut off the flow of air, just as they 
do in a stop; then they separate gradually. 
Examples: chain 
Jane 
[tf] 
[d3] 
Say the following words very carefully 
char jar 
Describe as accurately as you can the ways in which the 
articulators are used to obstruct the flow of air in the first 
sound of each word. Which one of the affricates is voiced? 

The production of speech 
7 
FRICATIVE: the articulators are brought very 
close together leaving only a very narrow 
channel through which the air squeezes on its 
way out, producing turbulence in the process. 
Examples: [f v 0 5 s z J 3] 
Say the following words and listen for the turbulence of the 
initial consonant: 
fan van thin then sink zinc shrill genre 
APPROXIMANT: the articulators are brought 
near each other but a large enough gap is left 
between them for air to escape without causing 
turbulence. 
Examples: [r 1 w j] as in 
read lead 
weed and yield respectively. 
NASAL: Nasal sounds are produced with air 
escaping through the nose; the velum is 
lowered to allow access to the nasal tract. 
Examples [m n rj] 
The final sounds in all these words are nasal: 
sum sun sung. 
On the other hand, to produce ORAL sounds 
like [p t k b d g s z] the VELUM is raised right 
up against the back wall of the PHARYNX, 
cutting off access to the nasal cavity and 
making air escape through the mouth only (see 
[1.2]). 
LATERAL: to produce a lateral, the air is 
obstructed by the tongue at a point along the 
centre of the mouth but the sides of the tongue 
are left low so that air is allowed to escape over 
one or both sides of the tongue. 
Example: [1] 
If you say the following words slowly and 
carefully, you will be able to observe how the 
air escapes over the sides of the tongue in the 
last [1] sound: 
peddle paddle huddle 
kettle battle 
cattle

Introduction to phonetics 
Examine the examples in [1.4] above once again. State 
the place of articulation of each consonant and also deter-
mine whether it is voiced or voiceless. 
Next find three more words exemplifying each manner 
of articulation that has been described. Take your examples 
from any language which you know. 
Summary 
The production of consonants involves four major param-
eters which can be varied independently of each other to 
create different kinds of consonant. The four parameters are: 
(a) THE AIRSTREAM MECHANISM 
This refers to the way in which the moving body of 
air that provides the power for speech production is 
generated and the direction in which it moves. 
(b) THE STATE OF THE GLOTTIS 
Voiceless sounds are produced when there is a wide 
open glottis, with a big space between the vocal cords; 
voiced sounds are produced when the vocal cords are 
close together so that the air has to force its way 
through them, making them vibrate in the process. 
(c) THE PLACE OF ARTICULATION 
This refers to the place in the vocal tract where the 
airstream is obstructed 
in the production 
of a 
consonant. 
(d) THE MANNER OF ARTICULATION 
This refers to the way in which the airstream is inter-
fered with in producing a consonant. 
1.3 The production of vowels 
Vowels are more difficult to describe accurately than 
consonants. This is largely because there is no noticeable 
obstruction in the vocal tract during their production. It is 
not easy to feel exactly where vowels are made. Moreover, 
in many cases, sounds perceived by hearers as the 'same 
vowel' may be produced using a number of substantially 
different articulatory gestures. The only reliable way of 

The production of vowels 
9 
observing vowel production is using x-ray photography. 
But this is not only expensive, it is also dangerous and could 
not be carried out each time one wanted to describe a 
particular vowel (even if willing subjects eager to allow 
themselves to be exposed to radiation in the noble cause of 
phonetic inquiry could be found). 
The account in this chapter will be restricted to vowels 
which occur in English but much of what is said is gener-
alizable to many other languages. As we noted above, many 
of the parameters described above which are used in the 
description of consonants have not been found applicable 
to vowels. Vowels are typically voiced, but they have no 
place or manner of articulation. Traditionally, for the 
description of vowels a different set of concepts has been 
found necessary. 
Say the words in [1.5] carefully. Observe in a mirror 
the position of the highest point of your tongue and your 
lower jaw. 
[1.5] [i] seek 
[u] pool 
[1] sick 
juj pull 
[e] set 
[D] pot 
[ae] sat 
[a] part 
Now repeat the exercise, just uttering the vowel sounds on 
their own. Again observe the position of your tongue and 
jaw. 
In each column your tongue is high when you say the 
vowel in the first word on the list and gets progressively 
lower as you work your way through the list. If you watch 
yourself in a mirror, you will observe that there is a corre-
lation between tongue height and jaw opening: when the 
tongue is high, the jaw is not lowered but when the tongue 
is low the jaw is also low and your mouth is wide open. 
Vowels produced with the highest point of the hump 
in the tongue close to the roof of the mouth are said to be 
HIGH and those produced with the highest point of the 
hump in the tongue barely rising above the floor of the 
mouth are said to be LOW; the intermediate position is 
referred to as MID. 

10 
Introduction to phonetics 
Up to now, we have considered the vertical axis in 
locating the highest point of the tongue. That is not 
enough. It is also necessary to determine the location of the 
highest point on the horizontal axis: the highest point of the 
tongue may be at the front, in the centre or at the back of 
the mouth. Depending on the location of the highest point 
of the tongue, vowels may be regarded as FRONT, 
CENTRAL or BACK. 
Say the words in [1.6] slowly a number of times and 
observe the position of your tongue in each case: 
[1.6] [e] shed 
[a] should ' 
[D] shod 
When you say the vowel [e] your tongue is in the front, 
palatal region; when you say [a] your tongue is in the centre 
of the mouth; when you say [D] your tongue shifts to the 
back of the mouth. That this is the case will be clear if you 
utter the vowels on their own one after the other. 
Finally, the quality of a vowel is affected by the shape 
of the lips. For simplicity's sake, phoneticians assume that 
lips can assume only two positions: they are either 
ROUNDED or UNROUNDED - intermediate positions 
are ignored. Lip rounding results in an elongated resonating 
chamber while lip SPREADING or UNROUNDING (the 
position the lips assume if you put on that fixed grin when 
the voice behind the camera tells you to smile or say 
'cheese') does not. Just as the notes which can be produced 
by different wind instruments partly depend on the shape 
of the instrument, the QUALITY of a vowel sound partly 
depends on the shape of the resonating chamber in the vocal 
tract resulting from adjustments in lip position. 
Get a mirror and once again observe your lips as you 
say the words in [1.7]. You will be able to verify that in 
each case the first word in each pair is said with spread 
(unrounded) lips while the second is produced with the lips 
rounded: 
[1.7] [i] see 
[u] sue 
[i] tea 
[u] two 

The production of vowels 
11 
[e] fen 
[o] fought 
[ae] lag 
[o] log 
The various articulatory parameters are not entirely 
independent of each other. Note, for instance, that there is 
a systematic correlation between lip rounding and tongue 
height. For a rounded vowel, the higher the tongue is, the 
greater the degree of lip rounding. 
The phonetic properties of vowels surveyed in this 
section are conventionally represented in this diagram: 
[1.8] 
Front 
Central 
Back 
High 
\ i 
u 
Mid 
\ e 
o 
Low 
\ 
a 
Unround 
Round 
As [i.8] shows, typically front vowels are unrounded 
and back vowels are rounded. 
The parameters high, mid and low enable one to 
distinguish three degrees of vowel height as you can see in 
[i.8]. But this is not always sufficient. There are languages 
which make a four way distinction on this parameter. Many 
phoneticians 
use the terms CLOSE, 
HALF-CLOSE, 
HALF-OPEN and OPEN to reflect this:

Introduction to phonetics 
All the vowels which have been described so far are 
M O N O P H T H O N G S i.e. vowels whose quality remains 
virtually unchanged throughout their duration. In addition 
to such vowels some languages (English included) also have 
DIPHTHONGS, i.e. vowels whose quality changes during 
their production. 
Say the following words, concentrating on the vowel 
sound: 
[ I . I O ] pie 
buy 
my 
guy 
cry 
tie 
die 
sigh 
shy 
high 
lie 
five 
Identify the shifting positions which your tongue occu-
pies as you produce the vowel. 
Initially the tongue is low and front but it finishes up 
in a high, front position. The symbol for this vowel is [ai]. 
N o w say the words in [ i . n ] and again observe the 
shifting quality of each vowel: 
[ i . n ] a . cow now shout out 
[ao] 
b. toy boy boil coin 
[DI] 
c. wait pay weight hay [ei] 
d. air fare wear chair 
[ea] 
In [1.12] you can see the changing quality of the diph-
thongs exemplified above:

(1967), Ladefoged (1982) or Knowles (1987). 

Chapter 2 
The phoneme 
2.1 Segments of sound 
As we hinted in the opening chapter, and are going to see 
in detail in this and subsequent chapters, in purely physical 
terms, any utterance is a continuum: articulatorily, it is a 
continuous flow of gestures that blend with each other; 
acoustically, it is a continuously fluctuating wave of sound. 
Yet, for several reasons, from a functional point of view, 
the fiction of discrete speech segments with which the last 
chapter ended is worth clinging to. 
Firstly, an ALPHABETIC WRITING SYSTEM, with 
discrete letters written in a line one behind the other, seems 
to be capable of representing the sound system of any 
language in a non-arbitrary way. Indeed, native speakers, 
if they are literate in an alphabetic writing system, can 
usually determine without any difficulty, the 'distinct' 
sounds which a word consists of. Of course, to this you 
might reply that the idea of SEGMENTS is perhaps not 
inherent in the nature of the spoken language but is rather 
something inculcated by an alphabetic writing system - if 
people see words in terms of segments, that is simply 
attributable to the conditioning they have been subjected to 
by alphabetic writing. You might argue that it would not 
be surprising if it turned out that illiterate people or literate 
speakers of languages like Chinese and the American Indian 
language Cherokee, which have non-alphabetic writing 
systems, do not view speech in terms of segments. 
The Chinese writing system represents the WORD in 
its entirety. Thus the CHARACTER 0 represents the word 
'sun' and the character A represents the word 'man'. This is 
analogous to way in which mathematical symbols like ^ 

Segments of sound 
17 
< etc. represent entire concepts or words which are 
pronounced differently in different languages. Turning to 
Cherokee writing we observe that each symbol represents 
an entire syllable. For instance, f, A, J respectively represent 
the syllables ga, go, and gu. 
By itself^-alphabetic writing is not sufficient proof of 
the reality of sound segments. More persuasive evidence 
needs to be found. One source of such evidence is SPEECH 
ERRORS. Quite often, speech errors occur in which sounds 
are transposed in words, as though they were discrete items. 
Have we not all heard spoonerisms where word initial 
consonants are switched from one word to another, 
resulting in forms like polley trusher and sork pausages when 
the speaker really means to say trolley pusher and pork 
sausages'? 
Pause for a moment and list at least three more spoon-
erisms. Describe the transposition of sounds that takes place 
in each one of your examples. 
Admittedly, spoonerisms are an aberration (the Rev. 
W.A. Spooner would not have become so famous if swop-
ping consonants between words was the norm). What 
makes spoonerisms interesting is the way in which they 
clearly illustrate the treatment of speech sounds by speakers 
as discrete segments which can be shunted from one word 
to another. 
The same kind of segmentalization of speech sounds is 
also manifested in normal spoken language - albeit usually 
in a less extreme form. There are numerous phonological 
operations (as you will discover as you work your way 
through the book) which re-arrange, add or delete indi-
vidual consonant and vowel segments of a word rather than 
some larger pieces such as syllables. For instance, many 
non-standard varieties of British English have a rule which 
'drops aitches' at the beginning of a word. The effect of this 
rule is to make words like at and hat sound exactly the same. 
Rules which drop sound 'segments' exist in languages 
regardless of whether they have an alphabetic writing 
system. Similarly, rules which insert segments exist in 
languages regardless of whether they have an alphabetic 

18 
The phoneme 
writing system. I have in mind rules like the one which 
optionally inserts [r] between vowels within a word as in 
draw(r)ing (for drawing) or across a word boundary as in 
the idea (r) is (for the idea is). 
The upshot of this discussion is that one important 
aspect of linguistic knowledge is the knowledge of the func-
tional phonological units which occur in one's language -
the knowledge of the segments which can be arranged in 
different patterns to form words. This knowledge is for the 
most part unconscious (just in the same way that knowledge 
of how to build boats which can float when fully laden has 
been in the minds of boat builders from time immemorial 
- long before they had any explicit understanding of the 
principles of physics involved). Most speakers of English 
do not spend half the day wondering whether to 'drop an 
aitch' in a word like hat or 'swallow a t' in a word like better. 
But that does not mean that they do not know the rules 
which govern the sound pattern of their language. Phon-
ology attempts to make explicit the nature of the knowl-
edge that underlies their subconscious linguistic behaviour. 
2.1.1 Distinctiveness: phonemes and allophones 
A useful approach to the problem of how segments of 
sound are used in speech is to consider sounds from a 
FUNCTIONAL point of view, to talk not in terms of 
individual physical sounds, but of FAMILIES of sounds 
which count as the same in the language in question. Such 
a family of sounds is called a PHONEME.1 Members of the 
same phoneme family, i.e. the various physically distinct 
sounds which count as executions of a given phoneme are 
called the ALLOPHONES 
(or VARIANTS) 
of that 
phoneme. A phoneme is conventionally represented by a 
letter symbol between slant lines. Thus, in English, the 
infinitely physically diverse voiceless stops that can be made 
with contact between the tongue and the palate are grouped 
into two phonemes labelled /t/ and /k/, each of which has 
a range of allophones which differ slightly from each other. 
Which phoneme a particular sound heard in speech 
belongs to entirely depends on the language in which it 
occurs. In some languages, such as Slavonic ones, some of 

Segments of sound 
19 
the physically attested sounds which in English would be 
regarded as somewhat off-target renderings of /t/ or /k/ 
would instead be members of a third, separate phoneme 
/c/, to which English has nothing corresponding. 
Sounds are grouped together as members of the same 
phoneme when the very real physical differences between 
them happen to be functionally immaterial with respect to 
the language being described. 
Utter the following words slowly: car keys. You will 
notice that in car, the back of the tongue touches the part 
of the soft palate near the uvula (see the figure in [1.2] on 
page 14), at the very back of the roof of your mouth, but 
in key, it is the more front part of the soft palate near the 
hard palate that the tongue makes contact with. The two 
varieties of 'k' are physically different. But they are not 
functionally different in English. They cannot be used to 
distinguish word meaning. Rather, they are allophones of 
the same /k/ phoneme and which one is used on a given 
occasion depends on what the neighbouring sounds happen 
to be. 
The two 'k' sounds are in COMPLEMENTARY 
DISTRIBUTION. When two sounds are in complementary 
distribution, they are barred from occurring in identical 
environments: there is a rigid division of labour, as it were, 
so that one sound appears in certain contexts and the other 
in some different, clearly defined contexts. Thus, in our 
example, the very back allophone (variant) [k] of the 
phoneme /k/ found in car (allophones are written in square 
brackets) occurs before back vowels and the fronted [+], as 
in key occurs before front vowels (the + diacritic under a 
consonant indicates fronting). Another example of comp-
lementary distribution in English should make the point 
clearer. The phoneme /t/ has several allophones. It is poss-
ible to predict the allophone that speakers produce in a 
given word if you know the sounds that are adjacent to it. 
Say the words: tea, too and eighth. You will notice that 
the alveolar allophone [t] in tea [ti] is made with the lips 
spread but that in too [twu] is made with pursed or rounded 
lips (a little, raised 'w' is used to show lip rounding). 
However, in [eit0] 'eighth' the allophone of /t/ is dental, 

20 
The phoneme 
[t] [n] is the diacritic mark for dental sounds) not alveolar 
- in anticipation of the dental fricative [8] which follows, 
the tip of the tongue is positioned against the upper front 
teeth. 
It is worth stressing that the relationship between a 
family of sounds is not like that between members of a 
human family. The phoneme is an abstraction. What actu-
ally occur are the allophones - to be precise PHONES i.e. 
sounds which can be grouped together as allophones of a 
particular phoneme. We hear a range of physically different 
sounds in English, such as those described above, which we 
recognise as being functionally non-distinct. We use the 
theoretical construct of PHONEME to mean that function-
ally speaking, a given set of sounds never contrast with 
each other although they may contrast with other sounds 
outside that set. 
All sounds used in a language belong to some 
phoneme. Some phonemes have numerous allophones 
others may have a less diverse membership. Since we need 
some label to identify a phoneme, the obvious and usual 
thing to do is to represent the phoneme using the phonetic 
symbol for one of its allophones. Accordingly, 
for 
simplicity the phoneme that includes [t] and [t] and [tw] is 
labelled /t/; it could equally well be labelled /t w/ or, for 
that matter an arbitrary number like /13/. But, although in 
principle there is no significance in the label given to a 
phoneme, it would be perverse to make a determined effort 
to avoid mnemonic labels: /t/ is preferable to /13/ as the 
label for the English phoneme which we are discussing. 
Some phonemes such as English /m/ have a dominant 
family member which occurs in almost all contexts. In such 
cases the selection of the symbol of that allophone to 
represent the phoneme is uncontroversial. Other phonemes 
such as /t/ have no clearly dominant family member and 
the choice of the symbol of one of the allophones to 
represent the phoneme is not as easily justified. Neverthe-
less, in neither case should the sound chosen to represent 
the family be equated with the family itself. 
The family metaphor is also useful in highlighting 
another 
principle of phoneme 
theory: namely, 
the 

Segments of sound 
21 
PHONETIC SIMILARITY OF ALLOPHONES of the 
same phoneme. The phoneme is a suitable label for a group 
of sounds which are phonetically alike and which show 
certain typical patterns of distribution. This principle is 
intended to prevent the lumping together as allophones of 
the same phoneme's sounds which appear to be in comp-
lementary distribution but have no phonetic similarity. A 
classic example of this is provided by [rj] and [h] in English. 
At first sight, these two sounds appear to be in comp-
lementary distribution, with [h] occurring syllable initially 
followed by a vowel (as in hat and ahead) and [n] occurring 
in consonant clusters and syllable finally (as in longer and 
long). But because they lack phonetic similarity, [h] and 
[rj] cannot be grouped together as allophones of the same 
phoneme. 
What are the articulatory differences which disqualify [h] 
and [o] from counting as allophones of the same phoneme? 
Take into account the following articulatory parameters: 
place of articulation, manner of articulation and the state of 
the glottis. 
Recall from Chapter 1 that [h] is a voiceless glottal fricative 
and [rj] a voiced velar nasal. 
There is an alternative approach to the phoneme which 
highlights 
the linguistic function 
of phonemes 
in 
DISTINGUISHING (or CONTRASTING) word meaning 
rather than their physical phonetic characteristics. The key 
notion in this approach is CONTRAST or DISTINC-
TIVENESS. On this view, the phoneme is a minimal sound 
unit which is capable of contrasting word meaning. As we 
noted above, although in reality there is an infinite amount 
of variation in the sounds produced by speakers of a given 
language, not all these phonetic differences are pertinent. 
Some objectively noticeable variation in the production of 
sounds is not used to convey semantic differences. Consider 
the words in [2.1]: 
[2.1] tip ~ dip bet ~ bed 
pat ~ pad 
bit ~ bid mate ~ made white ~ wide 

22 
The phoneme 
The words in each pair have different meanings and this 
difference is signalled by the difference between [t] and [d]. 
When two sounds can be used to distinguish word mean-
ings in a particular language they are said to be separate 
phonemes. On the basis of [2.1] we can say that in English 
/t/ and /d/ are separate phonemes. 
Supply examples of English words with different 
meanings which only differ in that where one word has [1] 
the other has [r], all the other sounds being exactly the 
same. Are [1] and [r] separate phonemes in English? 
2.2 Identifying phonemes 
In this section I shall outline the basic procedures which are 
used to identify the phonemes, i.e. the functionally signifi-
cant segments of a language. 
2.2.1 The minimal pair test 
When two words are identical in all respects, except for one 
segment, they are referred to as a MINIMAL PAIR. The 
pairs in [2.1] are minimal pairs (and so should be the pairs 
illustrating the contrast between [r] and [1] which you have 
written down). The MINIMAL PAIR TEST (i.e. the 
method of determining that a single sound 
difference 
distinguishes the meanings of two words) is a key principle 
of phonemic analysis. Sounds are classified as separate 
phonemes if they are responsible for a difference in meaning 
in a minimal pair. 
Another way of saying this is to state that sounds are 
separate phonemes if they CONTRAST IN IDENTICAL 
ENVIRONMENTS, i.e. if either sound can occur in a 
given context and the choice of one or the other does alter 
the meaning of a word. The forms in [2.2] show minimal 
pairs in which [r] and [1], [m] and [n] and [k] and [g] 
contrast in identical environments and are therefore distinct 
phonemes: 

Identifying phonemes 
23 
[2.2] read ~ lead 
rice ~ lice 
room ~ loom 
mow ~ know mice ~ nice seen ~ seem 
buck ~ bug 
cot ~ got 
card ~ guard 
Before you read on, list as many minimal pairs as you 
can think of which show that [b] and [m], [s] and [z] and 
[i] and [e] are separate phonemes in English or some other 
language which you know. To start you off, here are some 
minimal pairs which show that [b] and [m] contrast word 
meaning in English: bat ~ mat, bet ~ met, meat ~ beat, robe 
~ roam, cub ~ come. 
2.2.2 Contrast in analogous environments 
Sometimes 
it 
is not 
possible 
to 
find 
minimal 
pairs 
contrasting each single phoneme. In such circumstances, the 
phonologist has to settle for something less rigorous: 
C O N T R A S T 
IN 
A N A L O G O U S 
E N V I R O N M E N T S . 
Using this principle, sounds are isolated as belonging to 
separate phonemes if they occur in phonetically 
very 
similar, though not identical environments provided that 
the differences between them cannot be reasonably attrib-
uted to the influence of neighbouring sounds (see Chapter 
5). Admittedly, there are bound to be occasional differences 
of opinion between phonologists as to what constitutes 
adequate similarity to justify labelling environments as 
'analogous'. Phonological analysis is not an exact science. 
Here, I shall avoid getting bogged down in controversies 
and simply illustrate the principle of contrast in analogous 
environments with an example from Ewe, a Ghanaian 
language. 
We can regard /f/ and / v / as separate phonemes in Ewe 
because they contrast in analogous environments in words 
like [evlo] 'he is evil' and [efle] 'he split off ([e] symbolises 
a nasalised [e] vowel). The difference between nasalised [e] 
on the one hand and oral [e] and [o] on the other cannot 
be the reason for the difference between voiceless [f] and 
voiced [v] since nasal [e] as well as oral [e] and [o] are all 
voiced and should not affect in different ways the voicing 
of neighbouring sounds. 

24 
The phoneme 
2.2.3 Suspicious pairs 
Since, as we observed above, only those sounds which 
show considerable phonetic similarity can be grouped 
together as allophones of the same phoneme, it would be 
pointless to comb through the entire phonological system 
of a language in search of minimal pairs and examples of 
contrast in analogous environments. A practising phonol-
ogist can normally safely assume that sounds like [n] and 
[x] or [1] and [p] which show no phonetic resemblance are 
distinct phonemes. As a rule, methods for determining 
whether or not sounds belong to the same phoneme are 
only employed where SUSPICIOUS PAIRS have been 
identified, that is to say, pairs of words containing sounds 
which only differ slightly and which can plausibly be 
members of the same phoneme. 
A few examples should clarify this point. If you look 
back at the data in [2.2] which were used to illustrate the 
minimal pair test, you will notice that the sounds in each 
pair are quite similar and could conceivably be allophones 
of the same phoneme: [r] and [1] are both voiced alveolar 
approximants, the main difference between them being the 
fact that [1] is lateral and [r] is not; [m] and [n] are both 
voiced nasal stops, only differing in place of articulation -
the former is labial and the latter alveolar; [k] and [g] are 
both velar stops - the only difference between them is that 
[k] is voiceless which [g] is voiced. Likewise, in the Ewe 
example, the contrast in analogous environments test is 
worth attempting because [fj and [v] are both labiodental 
fricatives, only distinguished by voicing: they could easily 
be allophones of the same phoneme. 
2.2.4 Recapitulation 
While admitting that the tacit 'theory' of clear-cut speech-
sound distinctions implied by the nature of our alphabet 
script is physically quite wrong, nevertheless we have gone 
on to argue that functionally it is largely right: a phonemic 
transcription will indeed treat a language as containing a 
small number of discretely-different unitary sounds, even 
though the phonetician knows that it does not. Many of the 
physical details of a sound are functionally irrelevant within 

Phonological symmetry 
25 
a given language. Hence sounds that are physically different 
may be regarded as functionally the same in a particular 
language. For example, speakers of English who are not 
linguists are unlikely to be aware of the variety of allo-
phones of /t/ which we noted above; they are only likely 
to be interested in knowing whether a word contains /t/ as 
opposed to some other phoneme - they will only want to 
know whether the word uttered by their interlocutor is cart_ 
or card, tin or thin etc. 
Furthermore, as we shall see presently, functionally it 
makes sense to think of the changes in the various phonetic 
variables which make up a sound as happening in an abrupt 
and synchronised fashion, even though physically they are 
gradual and they overlap each other. That is to say, 
although in a word like inn, it is true that the soft palate will 
begin to be lowered before the tongue makes contact with 
the alveolar ridge, there is no functional significance in the 
fact that the latter part of [i] in inn will be progressively 
nasalised while the [i] of if is wholly oral. The English-
speaking hearer will not perceive the difference between the 
two [i]'s. To such a hearer inn consists of just two sharply-
separated sounds: oral [i] followed by nasal [n]. In view of 
this, psychologically we are justified in thinking of speech 
as segmented along the time dimension, even though physi-
cally the segments blend into one another - the situation is 
very much analogous to that of cursive handwriting. 
2.3 Phonological symmetry 
There remains one aspect of the 'tacit alphabet theory' of 
speech-sound which has not yet been justified even in func-
tional or psychological terms, and which indeed cannot be 
so justified. I refer here to the way that alphabetic transcrip-
tion (traditional orthography and phonemic transcription 
alike) treats successive segments of speech-sound as single 
atomic elements, transcribed with one symbol each, rather 
than as bundles of simultaneous elements, each element 
being a value of a particular phonetic variable. That is: let 
us forget for a moment that the [n] of inn overlaps the 
[i], and pretend instead that there is a sharp division 
between the [i] part of the word and the [n] part; it still 

26 
The phoneme 
remains true that an utterance of [n] is not one unitary 
action, but the simultaneous realisation of a range of 
separate phonetic properties. These include: a tongue/palate 
contact belonging to the family that count as 'alveolar' 
rather than 'palatal', 'stop' rather than 'fricative' closure, 
voice, a lowered soft palate that results in a sound that is 
nasal rather than oral (see [1.4]); and, if we are thinking 
about dissimilarities not only with other English phonemes 
but with non-English sounds as well, we would need to add 
'pulmonic egressive airstream' and perhaps other features of 
sound. Clearly, speech sounds are not indivisible atoms. 
However, for convenience in reading and writing, it 
is advantageous to use a code which represents a whole 
bundle of such phonetic properties using a single symbol, 
rather than having to represent a word like inn in a two-
dimensional notation, with a table showing articulatory 
parameters as in [2.3]: 
[2-3] 
Segment 1: [1] 
Segment 2: [n] 
vocal cords: 
soft palate: 
place of articulation: 
manner of articulation: 
degree of aperture: 
vibrating 
up 
(not applicable) 
(not applicable) 
close etc. 
vibrating 
down 
alveolar 
stop 
(not applicable) 
This aspect of alphabetic writing is only a matter of practical 
convenience and long tradition, and there seems to be no 
good theoretical justification for it; functionally as well as 
physically, sounds are 'bundles of phonetic properties' 
rather than unitary lumps. 
One reason for saying that the internal structure of 
phonemes is in all probability relevant to the way in which 
they function phonologically has to do with the tendency 
to SYMMETRY found in the phonological systems of 
numerous languages. 
Consider vowel systems, for instance. It is possible to 
classify vowel systems into two common 
categories: 
TRIANGULAR and QUADRANGULAR systems. They 
may be very basic, or more elaborate as you can see in [2.4]

Czech, Burmese, 
Kikuyu (Kenya) 
Dyirbal (Australia)) 
Swahili) 
Efik (Nigeria)) 
and [2.5] which illustrate triangular and quadrangular vowel 
systems respectively. 
About the simplest system of vowel phonemes common-
ly found (it occurs in Aleut Eskimo and Arabic, for instance) 
has just three members. Many other languages, such as 
Spanish, Czech, Burmese, and Swahili, distinguish three 
degrees of aperture and have a five-member vowel system. 
Yet others, like Italian, Kikuyu and Efik have four degrees 
of aperture and a seven-member vowel system. All these 
systems are triangular: there is a lone low (open) vowel and 
at least one pair of non-low vowels. 
Azerbaijani, British Columbian French, Persian and 
English exemplify (with different embellishments) the other 
common type, namely a quadrangular vowel system which 
may be represented as [2.5]:

Half-close 
e

Asymmetrical systems are logically possible but occur 
less commonly than symmetrical ones. Thus, for instance, 
four-member vowel systems such as those in [2.6] seem to 
be rare in comparison with the symmetrical ones.

Likewise, consonant systems also tend to be symmetri-

English has:

A system like that of Siriono, a Bolivian language, which 
has holes in the pattern is less common. In Siriono there are 
no voiced alveolar, velar and palatalised velar stops corre-
sponding to voiceless stops at these places of articulation.

If a language uses a particular phonetic property (such as 
'back' or 'stop' or 'voiced') at all, rather than use it to make 
a one off contrast, it will normally exploit it fully by 
employing it to form several phonemes. 
Consequently 
phonological 
systems tend to be symmetrical. 
Hence, 
symmetry is an outward sign of the underlying dimension 
of contrast in phonology. 
Another 
common 
factor 
encouraging 
phonological 
symmetry has to do with permissible combinations of 
phonetic properties in particular languages. In the vowel 
systems surveyed above, all the vowels were either front 
and unrounded (spread) or back and rounded. In all the 
languages in our examples front vowels must be unrounded 

Phonological symmetry 
29 
and back vowels (with the exception of [a](/) must be 
rounded. The prohibition of the combination of rounded-
ness with frontness and backness with unroundedness in 
vowels is by no means universal. There exist languages such 
as French and Swedish in which it is permissible for front 
vowels to be rounded and other languages such as Ivatan, 
spoken in the Philippines, and Vietnamese in which back 
vowels may be unrounded. 
Thus, in French, the vowel in words like tu, vu and lu 
which is represented by the phonetic symbol [y] is both 
front and round. And again, as you can see in [2.10], this 
combination of frontness and roundedness is not restricted 
to the close vowel [y] but is also found with other degrees 
of aperture (other than fully open - the reason for this gap 
being that the physical distinctions between spread and 
rounded lip-position are very slight for fully-open vowels, 
so that lip rounding is seldom used contrastively for such 
vowels in most languages):

u (as in fou) 
e (as in ete) 
0 (as in peu) 
o (as in peau) 
e (as in pere) 
ce (as in ocuf) 0 (as in monopole) 
In [2.10] I have not shown the degree of aperture. 
Before you proceed, rank the vowels on a scale indicating 
the relative height of the highest point of the tongue during 
the production of each one of these vowels. You may use 
[2. n ] to check your answer. 
I do not mean to exaggerate the extent to which 
languages exhibit PHONOLOGICAL SYMMETRY, it is 
only a tendency, and often a chart of phonemes will include 
one or two gaps which spoil the symmetrical pattern. For 
instance, among the consonants listed above for Czech, /g/ 
is quite marginal, being found only in words borrowed 
from other languages; in this case, one might be tempted 
to argue that it was the existence of this gap in an otherwise 
balanced pattern that enabled words containing [g] to be 
borrowed into Czech without this sound having to be 

30 
The phoneme 
modified in the way that foreign sounds that do not exist 
in the borrowing language are normally modified. 
This account might look plausible for Czech, but it 
would not do in those situations where asymmetry is unre-
lieved, even by borrowing. Thus, while French permits 
front rounded vowels although they are unusual, Viet-
namese forbids them but permits back spread (unrounded) 
ones which are no less unusual. Interestingly, there are only 
two 
back unrounded 
vowels in Vietnamese 
where 
symmetry would lead one to expect three: 
[2.11] 
Unrounded 
Rounded 
Front Back 
Back 
Close 
i 
ui 
u 
Half-close 
e 
o 
Half-open Open

0 
Open 
a 
There 'ought' to be a phoneme /A/ (I have filled it in and 
circled it in the chart), but in fact, Vietnamese has no such 
phoneme, not even in borrowed words. 
Such counter-examples notwithstanding, the import-
ance of phonological symmetry as a tendency rather than 
an absolute rule is very well established. Yet, if phonemes 
were regarded as unitary, indivisible atoms, with their 
internal phonetic make-up irrelevant to their functioning, 
this tendency would seem quite inexplicable. If a language, 
say English, 
were to possess twenty-four 
consonant 
phonemes, one would suppose that any selection of twenty-
four consonant sounds would do as well as any other, and 
it would be a remarkable coincidence if the twenty-four 
actually used in the language manifested any particular 
symmetrical patterning. It would be even more remarkable 
if the types of symmetrical patterns accidentally stumbled 
upon by one language, say English, just happened to be the 
same as those stumbled upon by numerous unrelated 
languages. As we have seen, this is indeed the case: the 
symmetrical patterns found in the phonological systems of 
the languages of the world appear to come from a very 
restricted range. 
If, on the other hand, instead of regarding phonemes 
as indivisible, atomic entities we think of phonemes and the 
phonemic symbols that represent them as merely a short-
hand way of indicating bundles of distinctive phonetic 

Phonological symmetry 
31 
features, then the apparently mysterious recurrence of the 
same parameters 
in 
phonological 
symmetry 
can 
be 
explained. Members of a language-community have to learn 
to produce and perceive the psychological 'target-value' of 
various phonetic dimensions which their language uses to 
distinguish word meanings: for instance, the Arabic speaker 
has to learn to make two distinctions on the dimension of 
vowel aperture and the Spanish speaker three.2 For a 
language to be phonologically symmetrical, with simple 
rules for combining phonetic properties, is a way of optim-
izing the use of phonetic parameters; it is a way of getting 
a relatively small number of different bundles of phonetic 
properties to do the job of distinguishing word meanings. 
Referring to the International Phonetic Alphabet in 
[1.13] on page 31, study the following consonants systems 
and write down your answers to the questions that follow: 
[2.12] (a) b n x t f g z 
(b) 
p r j t x d m k g b y n f v s z 
Which of these two systems is symmetrical? What advan-
tages has the symmetrical system got over the asymmetrical 
one? 
I hope you chose the system in [2.12b] as the symmetri-
cal one. There, every stop has a corresponding fricative, 
every voiced oral stop has a corresponding nasal one, and 
every voiced stop and fricative has a corresponding voiceless 
one: 
[2.13] 
labial 
alveolar 
velar 
voiced voiceless voiced voiceless voiced voiceless 
stop

p 
d 
t 
g 
k

The system in [2.12a] is the asymmetrical one. As [2.14] 
shows it is riddled with holes: 
[2.14] 
labial 
alveolar 
velar 
voiced voiceless voiced voiceless voiced voiceless

g

f

32 
The phoneme 
The consonant inventory in [2.14] is extremely un-
economical, using, as it does, three places of articulation, 
three manners of articulation and two values of the voicing 
variable (eight phonetic parameters in all) to define a mere 
seven consonants. On the other hand, the consonant inven-
tory in [2.13] represents a much better use of resources: a 
consonant system with fifteen sounds is created using the 
same eight parameters. 
Furthermore, you should note that while the asym-
metrical inventory can be defined only by imposing 
complicated regulations to ensure that only segments with 
permissible combinations of phonetic properties are gener-
ated (e.g. in [2.14] only the labial and velar stops, the 
alveolar fricative and nasal can be voiced), no such ad hoc 
restrictive statements are needed for the symmetrical 
system. 
One probable consequence of this is that a symmetrical 
system is easier to learn than an asymmetrical one - even 
when, as in our example the latter contains fewer elements. 
Predictably, for the most part phonological systems tend to 
be symmetrical, using in an optimum way phonological 
properties such as voice, alveolar and fricative which speech-
sounds are made up of. 
As we have already noted, it is unusual, but not 
unheard of, for a language to have an asymmetrical conso-
nant system like the one in [2.14]. An example is given 
below in [2.15] of such a skewed consonant system in 
Palauan, a Filipino language:

We shall conclude this chapter by emphasising the 
point that while the practical convenience of alphabetic tran-
scription is so great that it is used much of the time even 
in the theoretical study of phonology, we should nonethe-
less bear in mind the fact that such a transcription is no 
more than a practically convenient short-cut. What is 

Phonological symmetry 
33 
'really' happening in phonology is happening in terms of 
separate phonetic properties, not of 'unitary sounds'. It is 
these phonetic properties rather than phonemes that are the 
basic building blocks of phonology. Before we delve any 
deeper into phonology we shall explore the nature of these 
phonetic and phonological properties. That is the subject of 
the next chapter.

Notes 
1. 
There exists a very rich literature on the phoneme. Key 
works include Bloomfield (1926, 1933), Sapir (1925, 
1933), Jones (1931), Bloch (1941), Pike (1947), Hockett 
(x955) and Trubetzkoy (1939). Standard textbooks like 
Hyman (1975: 59-98) and Sommerstein (1977: 16-53) 
also contain good introduction to the literature. To 
those who want a more detailed account of the devel-
opment of phoneme theory (and phonological theory 
in general), I recommend Fischer-J0rgensen (1975) and 
Anderson (1985). 
2. 
This view is held by those who regard the phoneme 
as a psychological entity. Badouin de Courtenay is 
probably the best known holder of this view. He 
defined the phoneme as 'a mental reality, as the inten-
tion of the speaker or the impression of the hearer or 
both' (Twaddell 1953: 56) (see page 67 below).

3.1 Why are features needed? 
We saw at the end of Chapter 2 that phonological systems 
tend to be symmetrical and that a limited number of 
phonetic parameters, taken from a fairly small universal set 
recur in a variety of combinations in different languages. It 
makes sense to look beyond the phoneme and focus on 
those basic phonological ingredients, called DISTINCTIVE 
FEATURES, which phonemes are made of. 
Besides introducing you to distinctive features, this 
chapter will also serve as a restatement in a slightly different 
form of the principles of phonetics which were outlined in 
the first chapter. There is nothing mysterious about the fact 
that there is a relatively small inventory of phonetic features 
from which languages select different combinations to 
construct their individual phoneme systems. As all members 
of the human race are endowed with very similar articula-
tory and auditory capabilities, it is only to be expected that 
they will only be able to produce and utilise speech sounds 
built up from the set which is pre-determined by their 
biological endowment. 
The position presented in this chapter regarding 
distinctive features has not always been accepted by all 
students of phonology. At one time some scholars, like 
Bloomfield (1926), would not agree with the claim that the 
phoneme is not the most basic phonological element. 
Bloomfield thought that there were no phonologically 
relevant particles more elementary than the phoneme, 
although he was aware that on purely phonetic grounds the 
phoneme can be decomposed into more basic particles. 
The belief that the phoneme is the atomic, basic 

36 
Distinctive features 
building block of phonology is untenable, not only because 
of the arguments 
which have already 
been 
advanced 
concerning symmetry, but also for other reasons which I 
explore below. 
Firstly, even a cursory inspection of the phonology of 
any language will reveal that the phonological behaviour of 
phonemes is largely determined by the phonetic features 
which they are made up of. Consider the behaviour of /r/ 
in English. It undergoes partial devoicing when immedi-
ately preceded by voiceless stops but not when it is preceded 
by voiced ones: 
[3.1] pray 
[prei] 
brain 
[brem] 
train 
[trem] 
drain 
[drem] 
crane 
[krem] 
grain 
[grem] 
If you look at it in terms of the implementation of distinct 
articulatory gestures, it is clear that the signal to start 
voicing is delayed until well after the beginning of the /r/ 
due to imprecise adjustment of the articulatory apparatus in 
the transition from one sound to the next. Looking at 
sounds in terms of the individual parameters which they 
consist of allows an insightful expression of ASSIMILATION 
PROCESSES, i.e. phonological processes whereby one 
sound changes to become more like some other sound in 
its environment (see Chapter 5). By highlighting each ar-
ticulatory parameter and singling out the sub-phonemic 
particles (i.e. distinctive features) which phonemes are made 
up of, this approach is capable of treating assimilation 
insightfully as an instance of SPREADING of distinctive 
features. 
Examine the American English data in columns A and 
B in [3.2] and suggest reasons why a distinctive feature 
approach to these data is preferable to an indivisible, atomic 
phoneme approach: 
[3-2] 
A 
B 
/pad/ 
[paed] 'pad' 
/pan/ 
[psen] 
'pan' 
/pas/ 
[pass] 
'pass' 
/pam/ [paem] 'Pam' 
/pak/ 
[paek] 'pack' 
/pag/ 
[paerj] 
'pang' 

Why are features needed? 
37 
When solving [3.2], you will have discovered that if 
you treat phonemes as unanalysable entities, you have no 
straightforward way of showing that the vowel only assim-
ilates the property of nasality from the following consonant 
if that consonant is nasal as in [3.2B]. The SPREADING 
of nasality to the preceding vowel is due to the premature, 
anticipatory lowering of the velum, as the vowel is being 
produced, to let air escape through the nose during the 
articulation of the nasal consonant. Distinctive features thus 
facilitate the statement of assimilation processes by high-
lighting the various separate gestures involved in the 
production of speech. No equally natural way of stating 
assimilation processes is available if phonemes are treated 
as unanalysable units. 
An added advantage of the feature approach is that it 
enables us to highlight the internal structure of a sound. 
When we do that, it soon becomes obvious that phono-
logical segments have internal structure. Sounds are not 
bundles of unordered, unstructured phonetic properties. A 
simple example like [3.3] shows that distinctive features can 
be arranged one before another within a single phoneme: 
[ 3 3 ] 
[non-nasal] 
[nasal] 
[p 
* 
n] _ 
Whereas [p] is wholly oral and [n] is wholly nasal, the 
vowel [se] occurring between them is oral to begin with but 
subsequently becomes nasalised in anticipation of the 
following nasal consonant. The properties NASAL and 
NON-NASAL occur together in sequence in the same 
phoneme. 
Similar evidence of internal structure is to be found in 
diphthongs. In words like way [wei] and why [wai] the 
vowel sound has two distinct vowel qualities, a fact which 
is reflected in this case in the way in which the two phases 
of the sound are transcribed. The same point can be made 
about affricates like [ts], [dz], [tj] and [d3]. They are 

38 
Distinctive features 
composite consonants starting with a stop phase and ending 
with a fricative phase. In many languages, affricates behave 
in part as though they were stops and in part as though they 
were fricatives. Thus we can see that the phoneme is not 
an indivisible phonological unit. 
If we revisit the American English example above, a 
further reason for the espousal of a feature approach should 
become apparent: distinctive features bring out the fact that, 
in general, 
phonological 
rules apply to 
NATURAL 
CLASSES of sounds i.e. sounds which share certain 
phonetic properties. Thus, it would be bizarre for any 
language to have a rule nasalising vowels before the 
following assortment of consonants: [d s k t h], This is a 
ragbag of sounds which are phonetically very different from 
each other and which all lack the crucial property of being 
nasal which is passed on to an adjacent vowel during nasal-
isation. The chances of such an arbitrary nasalisation rule 
existing in any language are extremely remote. On the other 
hand, a rule which nasalises vowels in the neighbourhood 
of nasal consonants (as in [3.2]) is phonetically plausible and 
is found in numerous languages. The nasal consonants [m 
n rj] which condition the nasalisation form a natural class 
and they all contain the crucial feature of nasality which 
triggers off the nasalisation of the preceding vowel. 
Normally, sounds which are phonetically similar display 
similar phonological behaviour. In order to state the basis 
of the similarity between a group of phonemes, it is 
necessary to penetrate beyond the phoneme and scrutinise 
the phonetic features which they share. 
3.2 Jakobsonian features 
Current distinctive feature theory has its roots in the work 
of the Russian scholars Trubetzkoy and Jakobson who were 
based in Prague between the wars. When the Nazis occu-
pied Czechoslovakia, Jakobson fled to New York and later 
moved to Harvard where he introduced some of the ideas 
of the 'Prague School' to the Americans. 
The key publications are Trubetzkoy (1939) and 
Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1952). Trubetzkoy was mainly 
interested in devising a system of classifying the phonemic 

Jakobsonian features 
39 
OPPOSITIONS (i.e. contrasts) in the use of common 
phonological parameters like voicing and aspiration. His 
approach was TYPOLOGICAL, i.e. concerned with the 
classification and comparison of the sound systems of 
different languages in order to show that there is a limited 
number of ways in which phoneme inventories can be 
organised. He regarded the exploration of the constraints 
on the structuring of phonoloigcal systems as one of the 
tasks of the phonologist 
To take one example, Polish and English have only 
two bilabial stops, namely /p/ and /b/; the two sounds are 
almost identical except for the fact that the latter has the 
additional property or 'mark' of being voiced. It can there-
fore be referred to as being MARKED while the former, 
which lacks that additonal property, can be said to be 
UNMARKED. Note that the question of MARKEDNESS 
only arises when two sounds are in a two-way opposition. 
In the case of a multi-dimensional opposition like the place 
of articulation contrast between /p t k/, where no one 
sound is in any sense more basic than the others, the ques-
tion of markedness does not arise. 
Significantly, if in a particular language a phonemic 
contrast is NEUTRALISED or SUSPENDED, i.e. if a 
phonemic contrast generally observed is not found in a 
given environment, it is invariably a two-way opposition 
that is involved and normally it is the unmarked member 
of such an opposition that occurs in the PLACE OF 
NEUTRALISATION. Thus, in Polish /k/ and /g/ are 
distinct phonemes and contrast between vowels in minimal 
pairs like [ro^i] 'horns' and [sofei] 'juices'. But, in word-final 
position, [k] and [g] do not contrast. There, the opposition 
between them is neutralised or suspended and only the 
voiceless [k] occurs. That is the situation in the singular 
form of the noun : 'horn' and 'juice' are pronounced as [rufe] 
and [sofe] respectively (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth 1979:72-3). 
Neutralisation is one of the key concepts in phonology. We 
shall come back to it in Chapter 8. 
While Trubetzkoy was primarily concerned with phono-
logical typology, Jakobson and his collaborators concen-
trated their investigations on phonological oppositions that 
occur UNIVERSALLY. Jakobson hypothesised that although 
languages show an almost infinite amount of phonetic 

40 
Distinctive features 
variation, the range of phonemically contrasting features is 
severely restricted by universal principles. The initial 
proposal was that just a dozen acoustically defined pertinent 
contrasts (other than prosodic ones, involving such things 
as tone and stress which are usually associated with an entire 
syllable or word) would be found in all languages. 
Jakobson and his co-workers further hypothesised that 
the presence of certain oppositions in a language precludes 
the existence of other oppositions. For instance, they 
suggested that no language phonemically contrasts labialised 
consonants (i.e. consonants produced with rounded lips) 
with pharyngealised consonants (i.e. consonants made with 
a constriction in the pharynx). Although labialization and 
pharyngealisation are distinct as far as articulation is 
concerned, they are phonologically merely implementations 
of the same acoustic distinctive feature FLAT.1 
Another aspect of the Jakobsonian feature system was 
its BINARISM. Jakobson et al. (1952) insisted on a binary 
interpretation of all features. This was done by pushing the 
phonemicist's principle of distinctiveness to its logical 
conclusion: in order to distinguish between the meanings 
of words, they argued, what counts is either the presence 
or absence of a given feature (respectively indicated by a 
' + ' or ' —' before the feature in question). For example, to 
discriminate between the words in [3.4] what is crucial is 
the presence or absence of voicing in the first segment: 
[3. 4][+ voice] 
[— voice] 
bet 
pet 
den 
ten 
ghoul 
cool 
zinc 
sink 
Admittedly, binarism works well where there exists a 
two-way opposition, but it does not yield entirely satisfac-
tory results where multilateral contrast is involved. Take the 
case of a language which distinguishes four degrees of 
vowel height and has the vowels [i e e a] or a language that 
distinguishes four places of articulation and has the bilabial, 
alveolar, palatal and velar nasal consonants [m n ji rj]. In 
neither case can a binary characterisation of opposition be 
employed without some degree of arbitrariness, or at the 

Jakobsonian features 
41 
very least, without obscuring the fact that what is involved 
is a cline rather than a dichotomy. 
Binarism has remained controversial and there has 
developed a powerful lobby (Ladefoged 1971, 1975; Venne-
mann 1972) for multivalued features where GRADUAL 
OPPOSITIONS (like those found in vowel contrasts) or 
MULTIVALUED OPPOSITIONS (involving say, places 
of articulation) are concerned. Nevertheless, the dominant 
view among phonologists, and the the view adopted in this 
book, is that although the case for multivalued features is 
not without merit, from a phonological point of view, 
distinctiveness is the paramount consideration and its inter-
ests are best served by binary distinctive phonological 
features; for on every occasion, the hearer has to make a 
decision as to whether the speaker has said either this word 
or that word. True, the phonetic features which specify the 
phonetic realisation of a given feature, say voicing of stops 
in English, could be put on a multivalued scale like: 
[3.5] [d]: [3 voice] as in ladder where [d] is surrounded 
by voiced segments 
[d]: 
[2 voice] as in date where [d] occurs at the 
beginning of a word 
[d]: 
[1 voice] as in laid where [d], which is word 
final, is almost completely devoiced 
Phonetically, English voiced stops are fully voiced between 
vowels; less fully voiced word-initially and minimally 
voiced word-finally. In principle we could indicate the 
amount of voicing by using an infinite number of points on 
the voicing scale. Phonologically, however, this kind of low 
level detail is overlooked. Thus, for instance, although 
acoustically the final sound in a word like late may be 
virtually identical to the final consonant of laid, the two 
sounds are phonologically different: the former belongs to 
the /t/ phoneme and the latter to the /d/ phoneme. 
Phonetic features may be multivalued but phonological 
features need not be. A binary distinctive feature system is 
adequate because, what is relevant linguistically, is simply 
whether or not the sound uttered by a speaker is a realis-
ation of phoneme /t/ or /d/. As a rule, it is a dichotomous 
choice. 

42 
Distinctive features 
3.3 The SPE system of distinctive features 
Various shortcomings of the Jakobsonian features came to 
light in the 1950s and 1960s. It was discovered that the 
model was too parsimonious. The dozen or so features 
which it allowed were insufficient to account for all phono-
logical contrasts found in the languages of the world. 
Furthermore, it was criticised for using the same phono-
logical feature to characterise phonological oppositions 
which in some cases were manifested by different phonetic 
properties. For instance, if a sound was described as 
GRAVE (which means that most of the acoustic energy 
used in its production is concentrated in the lower part of 
the spectrum) you would not be able to tell whether it was 
a labial like [p], or a velar like [g], since the acoustically 
defined phonological property GRAVE could be correlated 
with either labial or velar articulation. 
Because of these and other inadequacies, Chomsky and 
Halle (1968) in their book The Sound Pattern of English 
(henceforth SPE) proposed a major revision of the theory 
of distinctive features. They replaced acoustically-defined 
phonological features with a set of features that have, in 
most 
cases, 
articulatory 
correlates. 
Furthermore, 
the 
number of features was also substantially increased. But, 
like their original Jakobsonian precursors SPE features 
remain binary. They have only two coefficients or values, 
plus (+) indicating the presence of a feature and minus 
(—) its absence, so that, for example, among other things, 
a sound like [p] is said to be [—voice] and [ — nasal] while 
[m] is [ + voice] and [ + nasal]. 
The list of distinctive features given below is based on 
SPE in the main, but it incorporates some of the modifi-
cation that have been proposed since 1968. 
It is not important to 'master' all the details of distinc-
tive feature theory at this stage. They are described mainly 
in order to show how the system works. But you should 
come back to this chapter ot refresh your mind as the need 
to use features arises in later chapters. 
3.3.1 Major class features 
The major class features define the major classes of sounds 

The SPE system of distinctive features 
43 
that are relevant in phonological analysis. The major classes 
include 
CONSONANTS 
and 
NONCONSONANTS, 
SYLLABICS and NONSYLLABICS, SONORANTS and 
NONSONORANTS (OBSTRUENTS). 
i. CONSONANTAL 
- 
NONCONSONANTAL 
[± cons] 
Consonantal sounds are produced with a drastic 
stricture along the centre-line of the vocal tract; 
nonconsonantal sounds are made without such 
obstruction. 
Obstruents, nasals and liquids are consonantal; 
vowels and glides" are nonconsonantal. 
2. SYLLABIC - NONSYLLABIC [± syllabic] 
Syllabic sounds are sounds which function as 
syllable nuclei; nonsyllabic sounds occur at 
syllable margins. Normally, syllabic sounds are 
auditorily more salient than adjacent nonsyllabic 
sounds. Vowels are syllabic and so are syllabic 
consonants such as [J] in bottle and candle or the 
nasal [n] in cotton and [m] in bottom. 
3. SONORANT - NONSONORANT 
(OBSTRUENT) [± sonorant] 
Sonorants are produced with a vocal cavity 
disposition which makes spontaneous voicing 
easy while nonsonorants (obstruents) have a 
vocal cavity disposition which inhibits spon-
taneous voicing. 
In other words,the unmarked (normally expected 
and natural) state for sonorants is to be voiced, 
while for obstruents the unmarked state of affairs 
is to be voiceless. 
Vowels, nasals and liquids are sonorant; stops, 
fricatives and affricates are obstruents. 
3.3.2 Cavity features 
These features refer to place of articulation. They specify 
where in the vocal tract modifications of the airstream take 
place in the production of particular sounds. 

44 
Distinctive features 
4. CORONAL - NONCORONAL [± coronal] 
To produce a coronal sound, the blade of the 
tongue is raised towards the front teeth, the 
alveolar ridge or the hard palate; for noncoronal 
consonants the blade of the tongue remains in a 
neutral position. 
Dental, alveolar, alveo-palatal, retroflex and 
palatal sounds are coronal; labial, velar, uvular 
and pharyngeal consonants are noncoronal. 
5. ANTERIOR - NONANTERIOR [± anterior] 
In the production of anterior sounds, the main 
obstruction of the airstream is at a point no 
farther back in the mouth than the alveolar ridge; 
for nonanterior sounds the main obstruction is 
at a place farther back than the alveolar ridge. 
Labials, dentals and alveolars are anterior 
while all other sounds are not. 
6. LABIAL - NONLABIAL [± labial] 
A sound is labial if it has a stricture (narrowing) 
made with the lips; if there is no such stricture, 
the sound is nonlabial. 
In the 
literature 
the alternative 
feature 
ROUND is often used to refer to many of the 
sounds which can also be described as labial. 
Rounded sounds are produced with a pursing 
or narrowing of the lip orifice. There is a 
considerable degree of overlap between the 
groups of sounds covered by the features 
[ + round] and [+labial]. Rounded sounds like 
[o] [u] and [w] are a subset of labial sounds; 
consonants like [p b m] are labial but not 
round. Labial sounds include bilabial and 
labiodental consonants as well as rounded 
vowels. All other sounds are nonlabial. 
7. DISTRIBUTED 
- 
NONDISTRIBUTED 
[± 
distributed] 
Distributed sounds are made with an obstruction 
extending over a considerable area along the 
middle-line of the oral tract; there is a large area 
of contact between the articulators. In nondistri-

The SPE system of distinctive features 
45 
buted sounds, there is a smaller area of contact. 
This feature is primarily used to distinguish 
APICAL sounds from LAMINAL sounds. In 
apical sounds the tip of the tongue makes contact 
with the front teeth or the alveolar or alveo-
palatal regions of the roof of the mouth while 
in laminal sounds it is the blade of the tongue 
that makes contact with those same areas. This 
feature also distinguishes labial from labiodental 
sounds. 
The following sound types are distributed: 
bilabial fricatives like [(j) 6] (lamino-)alveolar 
fricatives like [s z] 
(lamino-)alveo-palatal 
fricatives like [J 3]. 
The following sound types are nondistributed: 
labiodental 
fricatives 
like 
[f v] 
(apico-) 
dental fricatives like [0 3] retroflex fricatives 
like [§ zj. 
3.3.3 Tongue body features 
In SPE the neutral position of the body of the tongue is said 
to be the position which it assumes in the production of a 
mid front vowel. Other tongue configurations are regarded 
as departures from that norm. 
8. HIGH - N O N H I G H [± high] 
High sounds are made with the tongue raised 
from neutral position while nonhigh sounds are 
made without such raising of the body of the 
tongue. 
High sounds include vowels like [i u], the 
glides [w j], alveo-palatal, palatalized, palatal 
and velar consonants. All other sounds are 
nonhigh. 
9. LOW - N O N L O W [± low] 
Low 
sounds 
are produced 
with the 
tongue 
depressed and lying at a level below that which 
it occupies when at rest in neutral position; 
nonlow sounds are produced without depressing 
the level of the tongue in this manner. 

46 
Distinctive features 
Open vowels like [a a D] are low and so are 
the pharyngeal consonants [h] and [?]. All 
other sounds are nonlow. (MID vowels are 
both NONHIGH and NONLOW.) 
10. BACK - NONBACK [± back] 
Sounds produced with the body of the tongue 
retracted from neutral position are back. Sounds 
produced with the body of the tongue either in 
neutral position or pushed forward are nonback. 
This feature 
distinguishes 
between 
back 
vowels like [u o a] and front vowels like [i e 
e]. (Note that because in SPE the position of 
the tongue in the production of a mid front 
vowel is taken as the neutral position, it is not 
only back vowels that are [+ back], but also 
central ones like [4- a-tt]. (Because the feature 
system is binary, there is no way of showing 
that certain vowels are neither front nor back; 
central vowels are grouped together with back 
vowels. This does not appear to be entirely 
satisfactory on purely phonetic grounds.) 
Of 
the 
consonants, 
velars, 
uvulars 
and 
pharyngeals are back while labials, dentals, 
palatals as well as glottals are nonback.3 
I I . VELAR SUCTION - NONVELAR SUCTION 
[± velar suction] 
This feature is used to characterise CLICK 
SOUNDS like the Tut tut\ used in English to 
show disapproval. 
While in English clicks are not fully-fledged 
speech sounds which can combine with other 
sounds to form words, in some languages 
(which happen to be almost exclusively found in 
Southern Africa) clicks are used as regular speech 
sounds. 
The production of a click involves two 
crucial phases. First there must be a stricture 
made using the back of the tongue and the 
velum; this is called VELIC 
CLOSURE. 
Secondly there must be some constriction in the 
labial, dental, alveolar or alveo-palatal area. The 

The SPE system of distinctive features 
47 
feature 
[ + velar 
suction] 
itself 
describes 
the 
pulling back of the body of the tongue which 
creates a partial 
vacuum 
between 
the 
velic 
closure at the back and the forward closure, say 
at the alveolar ridge. The resulting sound is a 
click. 
Clicks are produced with an INGRESSIVE 
VELARIC AIRSTREAM MECHANISM (which 
is different from the more common pulmonic 
egressive 
airstream 
mechanism 
described 
in 
Chapter i which is used in English). The soft 
palate and the back of the tongue are the ini-
tiators of the movement of air and the direction 
of the airflow is inward. 
Clicks are velar suction sounds; other sounds 
are not. Zulu has a dental click [j], an alveolar 
click [rj] and an alveo-palatal click [c]. 
3.3.4 Tongue root features 
The vocal tract is a long tube with holes at both the lip end 
and the throat end. The shape of this tube can be modified 
by rounding the lips and making them protrude - and thus 
elongating the tube. Alternatively, the tongue root position 
can be adjusted by pushing it forward or retracting it so that 
the vocal tract is either lengthened or shortened. Either of 
these actions has the effect of modifying the shape of the 
resonating chamber in the vocal tract in much the same way 
as differences in size and shape of wind instruments affect 
the notes which they produce. 
12. A D V A N C E D 
T O N G U E 
R O O T - 
N O N A D -
V A N C E D T O N G U E R O O T [± ATR] 
The tongue root is pushed forward 
in 
the 
production of advanced tongue root sounds, thus 
expanding 
the 
resonating 
chamber 
of 
the 
pharynx and possibly pushing the tongue body 
upward; if the tongue root is not advanced, it 
remains in a neutral position. 
Vowels like [i e o] in many West African 
languages are made with the tongue 
root 
pushed forward while [i c o] are made with the 
tongue root in neutral position. 

48 
Distinctive features 
13. TENSE - LAX [± tense] 
The validity of the feature TENSE has always 
been controversial. I quote Halle and Clements 
(1983:7) who give this cautious definition: 
'Tense vowels are produced with a tongue body 
or tongue root configuration involving a greater 
degree of constriction than that found in their lax 
counterparts; this greater degree of constriction 
is usually accompanied by greater length. (Tense 
vowels vs. lax vowels.) We note that this feature 
and the last [ATR] are not known to co-occur 
distinctively in any language and may be variant 
implementations of a single feature category.' 
The English 'long' vowels and diphthongs [i, 
a, 0, u, ei, ai, oi, au, ju] are tense while the 
'short' vowels [1, e, se, u, A, D] are lax. 
3.3.5 Laryngeal features 
14. SPREAD GLOTTIS - NONSPREAD GLOTTIS 
[± spread] 
Pushing the vocal cords wide apart augments the 
airflow through the glottis and inhibits voicing. 
This gesture, which is associated with voiceless-
ness and aspiration, is absent in nonspread 
sounds. 
Spread 
sounds 
include 
aspirated 
stops; 
murmured and breathy voice sounds, voice-
less vowels and voiceless glides. All other 
sounds are nonspread. 
15. CONSTRICTED GLOTTIS -
NONCONSTRICTED GLOTTIS [± constr] 
Constricted sounds are GLOTTALISED. They 
are produced with a severe obstruction of the 
glottis which is made using the vocal cords. This 
inhibits or prevents the free vibration of the 
vocal cords. No such gesture occurs in the 
production of nonconstricted sounds. 
Constricted sounds include implosives, ejec-
tives, glottalised and laryngealised consonants 

The SPE system of distinctive features 
49 
as well as creaky voice and glottalised vowels 
and glides. All other sounds are nonconstricted. 
In the opening chapter of this book we 
observed that English only uses speech sounds 
made with the pulmonic airstream mechanism, 
but there are languages which employ additional 
mechanisms. Earlier in this chapter (see section 
3-3-3) y° u wiH recall that I remarked on the use 
of clicks in many Southern African languages 
when another airstream mechanism, namely the 
velaric airstream mechanism was introduced. 
Here I shall briefly describe the remaining 
airstream mechanism found in languages. It is 
called 
the 
GLOTTALIC 
AIRSTREAM 
MECHANISM. 
To understand how it works, I suggest that you begin by 
making a big constriction in your throat - pretend that you 
are just about to cough. Get your vocal cords firmly 
together and shut off the glottis. At this stage, an upward 
movement of the larynx will push out the air above the 
larynx while a downward movement of the larynx will suck 
in air and loosen the constriction; the vocal cords will 
vibrate vigorously as the air flows in. 
Stops made with the GLOTTALIC AIRSTREAM 
MECHANISM, with the air above the larynx being 
expelled, are called EJECTIVES. Ejectives are voiceless. An 
example of an ejecdve is the [t'] in Tlingit, a language of 
Alaska, in the word [t'ij] 'elbow'. 
Stops made with the GLOTTALIC INGRESSIVE 
AIRSTREAM MECHANISM are called IMPLOSIVES. 
The air drawn into the larynx as it is pulled downward 
normally causes heavy voicing. An example of this is the 
bilabial stop, 
in the word 
[6a6a] 'father' 
in Shona 
(Zimbabwe). 
16. VOICED - VOICELESS [± voice] 
Voiced sounds are produced with the vocal cords 
vibrating at regular intervals; voiceless sounds 
are produced without such periodic vibration.

Distinctive features 
3.3.6 Manner features 
These characterise the way in which the airstream is 
obstructed in the production of a consonant. 
17. C O N T I N U A N T - N O N C O N T I N U A N T [±cont] 
Continuants are produced by impeding, but not 
completely blocking, the flow of air through the 
glottis, or the pharynx or through the centre of 
the oral tract; noncontinuants 
are made 
by 
completely blocking the flow of air through the 
centre of the vocal tract. 
Affricates, nasals and oral stops and laterals are 
noncontinuant. All other sounds are continuant. 
18. LATERAL - NONLATERAL [± lateral] 
A lateral sound 
is produced 
if the 
airflow 
through the centre of mouth is blocked and air 
only escapes over one or both sides of the 
tongue. 
In nonlateral 
sounds 
air 
flows 
out 
through the centre of the mouth. The English 
[1] is an example of a lateral LIQUID. (The term 
'liquid' is conventionally used to refer to T and 
'r'-like sounds.) 
Languages may have lateral sonorants, frica-
tives and affricates made at various places of 
articulation. 
19. NASAL - N O N N A S A L (ORAL) [± nasal] 
In the production of a nasal sound the velum is 
lowered to allow air to escape through the nasal 
cavity. Oral sounds are produced with the velum 
raised so as to block access to the nasal cavity 
and to allow air to go out only through the 
mouth. 
Nasal sounds include nasal stops like [m n 
H, ji rj] (which are made with complete blockage 
of air at the place where the articulators meet) 
as well 
as nasalised 
consonants, 
glides 
and 
vowels. All other sounds are oral. 
20. STRIDENT - N O N S T R I D E N T [± strident] 
Only fricatives and affricates can be strident. 
Acoustically, strident sounds are characterised by

more 
random 
noise 
than 
their 
nonstrident 
counterparts. 
In the SPE system, 
where features 
are 
generally 
defined 
in 
articulatory 
terms, 
the 
feature [strident], which is acoustically-defined 
is different from the rest - it is a relic retained 
from the original Jakobsonian system. 
Fricatives which have high pitched strident noise 
are referred to as SIBILANTS. The feature stri-
dent distinguishes fricatives as follows:

RELEASE [± del rel] 
This 
feature 
is 
only 
applicable 
to 
sounds 
produced in the mouth cavity and distinguishes 
stops from affricates. In stops, the closure is 
released abruptly while in affricates it is released 
gradually: the initial hold phase of an affricate 
is similar to that of a stop but in the later release 
phase an affricate is like a fricative. 
Only affricates can have the property [ + del 
rel]; all other sounds are [-del rel]. 
3.3.7 Prosodic features 
Prosodic features such as tone and stress, which are usually 
associated with an entire syllable or word, are difficult to 
describe. Although their phonological relevance is clear, 
their phonetic properties are not easy to specify satisfactorily. 
The account of prosodic features given in this chapter 

52 
Distinctive features 
is provisional. It is based on the SPE position which was 
dominant for a long time, and is reflected in much of the 
literature that appeared during the 1970s, but has been 
superseded by recent theories which will be outlined in last 
four chapters of this book. 
22. L O N G - SHORT [± long] 
This feature refers to the duration of a sound. 
Clearly, in purely physical terms this feature 
cannot be binary since length is always relative. 
In the SPE system, 
and in its Jakobsonian 
predecessor, length is not regarded as a basic 
phonetic property but rather as an incidental 
attribute of the feature [tense], which is binary. 
Thus in English, 
for example, 
the 
contrast 
between [i] and [1] (as in /sik/ 'seek' and /sik/ 
'sick';) is regarded as being essentially a tense 
versus lax opposition; the fact that / i / is longer 
than / i / is viewed as secondary. 
But even if this were the correct analysis, 
using the feature 
[tense] to subsume 
length 
would be questionable where differences 
in 
duration involve consonants since the feature 
[tense] is meant to specify vowels only. 
If we use the feature [±long], however, 
these difficulties are avoided because it is equally 
applicable to vowels and consonants. No prob-
lems arise when we encounter a language like 
Luganda 
(Uganda) 
which 
distinguishes 
long 
consonants from short ones in words like /ta/ 
[ta] 'release! (imperative)' and /tta/ [t:a] 'kill! 
(imperative)' as well as long and short vowels as 
in /kula/ [kula] 'grow up! (imperative)' and 
/kuula/ [ku:la] 'uproot! (imperative)'. 
In principle, the feature [long] is multi-
valued. A language could contrast more than 
two 
degrees 
of 
length. 
Kikamba 
(Kenya) 
contrasts three degrees of vowel length.4 In prac-
tice most languages which have distinctive vowel 
length only distinguish between long and short 
vowels. A binary approach, while not ideal is 
not altogether inappropriate. 

The SPE system of distinctive features

23. STRESS [± stress] 
Stress is an elusive concept. All stressed (or 
accented) syllables in a word are more salient 
than 
their 
unstressed 
counterparts 
but 
the 
phonetic 
manifestation 
of stress varies. 
The 
prominence of stressed syllables is due to an 
admixture of raised pitch, greater length and 
increased 
intensity 
of the 
signal, 
which 
is 
perceived as loudness. In addition, in 
some 
languages, e.g. English, stressed vowels retain 
their full vowel quality while unstressed vowels 
are reduced to some muffled vowel sound like 
schwa [a]. 
It is generally agreed in principle that stress 
need not be binary. In SPE, for instance, three 
degrees of stress are recognized for English. In 
practice, however, phonologists often treat stress 
as binary for convenience. 
24. T O N E 
It is important to distinguish between tone and 
pitch. The pitch of an utterance depends on the 
rate of vibration of the vocal cords, the higher 
the rate of vibration, the higher the resulting 
pitch becomes. Any time a voiced sound is 
produced, the vocal cords must vibrate at a 
certain rate: all languages have sounds which 
show pitch differences. In a T O N E language 
those pitch differences are used phonemically 
either to differentiate between word meanings or 
to convey grammatical distinctions. 
Commonly used tone features (which are 
normally indicated by writing the appropriate 
diacritic 
above 
the 
appropriate 
tone-bearing 
element) are: 
[±] High: 
(marked by (')) 
f±] Mid: 
(marked by (-)) 
[±] Low: 
(marked by (')) 
[±] Rising: 
(marked by (—')) 
[±] Falling: 
(marked by (*)) 
[±] Fall-rise: 
(marked by (")) 

54 
Distinctive features 
The use of tone to distinguish lexical meanings 
can be illustrated with this example from Igala, 
a Nigerian language (Welmers 1973): 
[3.6] awo 'guinea fowl' 
awo 'a slap' 
awo 'an increase' 
awo 'a comb' 
awo 'hole (in a tree)' awo 
'star' 
The use of tone to signal grammatical distinctions is illus-
trated with this example from Engenni (Nigeria), appearing 
in Bendor-Samuel (1974), where the distinction between 
declarative and negative sentences is marked using tone: 
[3.7] 
Positive 
Negative 
amo na dire eda 
amo na dire eda 
'the child should 
'the child should not 
cook beans' 
cook beans' 
I shall sum up the discussion so far by showing charts 
of distinctive feature matrices which contain arrays of

Distinctive features 
3.4 Segment structure redundancy 
One striking thing about the distinctive feature matrices 
presented 
in 
the 
previous 
section 
is the 
amount 
of 
R E D U N D A N C Y 
which they reveal: not every 
single 
phonetic property of a M O R P H E M E (i.e. minimal distri-
butional or meaningful part of a word, such as un-, kind, 
and -ly in unkindly) 
is distinctive. Many properties are 
R E D U N D A N T . This means that they are predictable by 
general principles. 
On the one hand, there are feature combinations that 
are predictable by universal SEGMENT 
S T R U C T U R E 
CONSTRAINTS. These feature combinations (e.g. [+nasal, 
+ sonorant, + voice]) go together hand in glove: they are 
U N M A R K E D , they are the norm. On the other hand, 
there are feature combinations that are normally incompat-
ible (e.g. [ + high, +low] or [— sonorant, +syllabic]). It is 
unusual for a language to have segments with combinations 
of features other than those predicted by universal segment 
structure constraints. Though not absolute, (e.g. a language 
can have syllabic obstruents or voiceless vowels or voiceless 
nasals) such restrictions on the combination of features play 
a key role in delimiting the inventory of possible speech 
sounds. Odd sounds like voiceless vowels, voiceless nasals 
or 
syllabic 
obstruents 
are 
extraordinary. 
They 
are 
MARKED. 
In addition to conforming to universal segment struc-
ture constraints languages may have their own idiosyncratic 
rules regulating feature combinations in their segments. An 
English example will clarify the point. In English (and 
indeed in most other languages), the feature [ — back] cannot 
be combined with the feature [-round]. Rounded 
front 
vowels like [y] are not permitted in English (but they are 
allowed in French, occurring in words like [ty] tu [vy] vu). 
To take another example, [1] is the only lateral allowed in 
English. If you know that a segment is lateral, then you 
know that it is also consonantal, sonorant, alveolar and 
voiced. However, although voiceless [1] is disallowed in 
English and most other languages, it does occur in a few 
languages. For instance, the sound spelled with '11' in Welsh 
words like Llandudno is a voiceless lateral fricative [i]. 

Segment structure redundancy 
57 
Besides segment structure redundancy, there also exists 
SEQUENTIAL R E D U N D A N C Y . As we shall see in the 
coming chapters correct inferences can often be made about 
a segment if the context in which it occurs is known. Thus, 
in spoken English, whenever there is a cluster of three 
consonants occurring syllable initially, the first consonant 
in the sequence is the fricative [s]. N o other consonant can 
occur in that position: splash and scream are English words 
but *Jilash and *zgream are not - and could not be. We shall 
explore this problem more fully in Chapter 9. 
Clearly, not all the phonetic properties of a sound are 
crucial in every case in distinguishing word meaning. Some 
properties are R E D U N D A N T , i.e. predictable and nondis-
tinctive. When writing phonological rules, the convention 
of omitting redundant properties is normally 
observed. 
Thus [p] [b] and (ejective) [p'] may be represented simply 
as in [3.11]: 
[ 3 - I I J

Notes 
FLAT consonants are contrasted with PLAIN ones. A 
flat consonant is produced by rounding the lips or by 
pharyngeal contraction. The resulting modification of 
the oral tract produces the acoustic effect of flattening, 
i.e. downward shift in the formants in the spectrum 
(Jakobson et al. 1952). 

Segment structure redundancy 
59 
In SPE the class of glides includes the semi-vowels [j] 
and [w] as well as the glottal stop [?] and the glottal 
fricative [h]. However, the case for formally recog-
nising a class of glides which includes [w j h '] is not 
altogether overwhelming. Some writers like Fromkin 
(1970) and Lass (1984) only recognise [w] and [j] as 
glides and argue for treating the glottal fricative [h] and 
the glottal stop ['] as obstruents on articulatory 
grounds. 
Although they are not made in the front of the mouth, 
glottals are not back because, by the definition given 
in SPE, only sounds produced with the tongue pulled 
back from neutral position are back. In the production 
of glottals the tongue is in neutral position, and does 
nothing. The vocal cords are the articulators. 
Ladefoged (1971), citing Whiteley and Muli (1962), 
reports that Kikamba phonemically contrasts four 
degrees of vowel length: short, half-long, long and 
extra-long /V V. V: V::/ as in: 
kwelela 
'measuring' 
ku/a 
'start' 
kwele.la 'moving backward

kuele:la 'aiming at' 
ku/a: 
'giving birth'

CHAPTER 4 
Phonological 
representations 
4.1 Phonetics and phonology 
P H O N O L O G Y is the branch of linguistics which investi-
gates the ways in which speech sounds are used systemati-
cally to form words and utterances. By now it will be 
obvious that in order to understand phonology one must 
have a grasp of the basic concepts of phonetics, which as 
we saw in the first chapter, is the study of the production 
of speech sounds by speakers, their perception by hearers 
and their acoustic properties. Most speakers of a language 
like English, with a long tradition of writing, who have not 
made a study of phonetics and phonology tend to think of 
the sounds of speech through the medium of the ordinary 
alphabet. Becoming literate involves, among other things, 
mastering 
one 
particular 
rough-and-ready 
scheme 
of 
analysis for the phonetics of a given language. 
In the particular case of the English language, it 
happens that the analysis implied by the ordinary spelling 
is very 'rough' and inaccurate indeed. Probably most people 
who are literate in English are aware of this fact although 
few of them could state explicitly and systematically what 
these shortcomings are. Someone who has not studied 
phonetics has scarcely any vocabulary for describing spoken 
English other than the names of the letters of the alphabet 
(and possibly terms like 'consonant', 'vowel' and 'syllable'; 
but 
these 
are often 
interpreted 
as graphological, 
i.e. 
pertaining to the study of the written language). So, the 
most that can be done by the average speaker towards 
pointing out the shortcomings of English spelling is to cite 
particular instances of 'illogicality', such as the various 
pronunciations which correspond to the spelling -oo- in foot, 

Phonetics and phonology 
61 
fool, and blood or the various spellings that correspond to 
[ei] in maid and made, break and brake, weigh and way. 
Although people are aware of many individual cases of this 
kind, their general understanding of what speech is like is 
moulded almost wholly by the nature of the writing system 
that we use to record speech. Much of the point of a study 
of phonetics lies in acquiring the ability to penetrate behind 
the rough-and-ready analysis of speech which is implied by 
the standard orthography and to grasp what is really going 
on, especially in cases where the standard orthography is 
misleading. Moreover, as we shall see in the final section 
of this chapter, the ability to analyse and record speech in 
a more sophisticated way than that provided by the standard 
alphabet is not only of theoretical interest, it also has many 
practical applications. 
Answer this question before you read on: if traditional 
English orthography inculcates, in everyone who masters 
it, a crude theory about the nature of speech sounds, what 
would that theory be like, if it were stated explicitly? 
Most obviously, the English alphabet tells us that 
spoken utterances consist of linear sequences of elements: 
UNITARY SOUNDS occurring one after another. It is a 
fundamental characteristic of alphabetic writing to be one-
dimensional; letters follow one another across the page, it 
never happens that two letters occupy the same position in 
the left-to-right sequence as in [4.1]. 
[4.1] h or m or f1 
And, although in handwriting individual letters blend each 
into the next without sharp boundaries between them, this 
is just regarded as a hasty, convenient way of transcribing 
what are intended as a row of separate marks and appear 
as such in print. 
Secondly, the writing system tells us that these unitary 
elements differ from each other discretely, like beads on a 
string or chemical elements, rather than continuously, like 
shades of colour. If you ask me what colour a dress is, it 
makes perfectly good sense for me to say it is between green 
and yellow - perhaps more towards yellow than green; but 

62 
Phonological representations 
if you asked a geologist what metal a sample of moon rock 
consisted of, it would make no sense at all if the reply you 
got was that it was a metal somewhere between aluminium 
and 
molybdenum, 
a bit 
more 
molybdenum-y 
than 
aluminium-y. (Of course, it might be a mixture or alloy, 
containing both aluminium and molybdenum atoms; but 
each individual atom would be either aluminium or molyb-
denum: atoms do not shade into each other as colours do.) 
Do letters of the alphabet shade into each other as 
colours do or do they differ discretely like chemical 
elements? 
The answer, as we have already seen, is that letters of 
the alphabet resemble chemical elements rather than colours 
in this respect: a given word, say key either begins with the 
letter k or it does not, and there would be no sense what-
soever if, for instance, when playing a game of 'I spy with 
my little eye' one child said to another that she spied some-
thing beginning with a letter halfway between k and t. 
In brief, alphabetic writing teaches us: 
(i) that speech consists of linear sequences of unitary, 
discretely-different sounds; 
(ii) that there only a small number of types of sound 
in a language; 
(iii) that a sound occurring at a given place in one word 
can be identified with certain sounds occurring at 
different places in other words. 
When children learn to read in the early years at school, 
the above statements (i)-(iii) about the nature of speech 
sounds are not, of course, taught to them in so many words 
— indeed they are rather abstract statements which small 
children could hardly understand if they did hear them 
stated explicitly. But the fact that these propositions about 
how speech works are left implicit does not make them any 
less influential in moulding adults' perception of the nature 
of their language. Rather, the reverse: precisely because 
these propositions are not explicitly articulated, it does not, 
on the whole, occur to people to question them. As you 

Phonetics and phonology 
63 
work your way through this book, you will realise that each 
of these assumptions is, if not down-right false, at best a 
very partial and crude approximation to the truth. 
Of the points (i)-(iii) that I have listed, the one that is 
often called into question by adult English speakers without 
special knowledge of phonetics is (ii). People are well aware 
that the inventory of English sounds is not to be identified 
with the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet. They 
may recognise that, for instance, the two letters sh in words 
like shop and push stand for one rather than two sounds 
while the single letter x stands for two sounds in words like 
tax and box; and they may also be aware that the sound 
spelled c in rice is not the same as the sound spelled c in coal, 
but that the latter sound is the 'same' as the sound spelled 
by the different letter k in koala or by the letters ck in back. 
This does not mean that people generally question the exist-
ence of a limited inventory of English sounds - on the 
contrary, the general principle that speech is appropriately 
represented by means of an alphabet of a few dozen letters 
is usually taken for granted; but people think of English as 
a language whose alphabet regrettably fails to represent the 
spoken language accurately, partly because it needs a few 
more letters than it has got. 
The student of phonetics, however, knows that even 
the fundamental assumption of the linearity of sound 
segments in (i) is misleading as a model of what happens 
when we speak. A speaker does not articulate just one 
holistic speech sound at a time. Speech sounds are the result 
of many separate articulatory gestures which are made 
simultaneously. As we saw in the last chapter the speaker 
changes the position of the vocal cords as the utterance 
progresses; at the same time the soft palate is raised and 
lowered; the shape and position of the tongue and of the 
lips is also modified while all that is going on. A writing 
system faithful to this aspect of the nature of speech would 
record speech not as a linear sequence of letters, but more 
after the fashion of an orchestral score which includes 
separate staves, one above the other, for the activities of the 
various instruments (in the phonetic case, the various vocal 
organs). The 'score' for the articulation of the word mat, for 
instance might look like this:

As we saw in the last chapter, sounds can be thought 
of as bundles of distinctive features; they are the result of 
more or less simultaneous articulatory activities of various 
organs which imperceptibly merge with each other. Sounds 
are not neatly separated from one another in the way 
suggested by the self-contained, separate letters in a line of 
print. True, some of the articulatory events in a stretch of 
speech are fairly abrupt; during the production of [m], for 
instance, the lips stop the escape of air from the mouth until 
the bilabial closure is abruptly released. But even in cases 
like this where events on one stave of the orchestral score 
occur at precise moments, it is the exception rather than the 
rule for events on all the various staves to be synchronised. 
You can see in [4.2] that all the gestures involved in the 
production of a given sound do not necessarily start and 
stop at exactly the same time. Moreover, many of the 
events happening on the different staves will, by their 
nature, be gradual and not abrupt. For example, the raising 
of the velum takes time, and consequently, the first section 
of the vowel in mat will be somewhat nasalised during the 
transition from [m] to [ae]; movements of the body of the 
tongue are gradual and even a bilabial stop closure is not 
released as suddenly as all that. To take another example, 
conventionally, the English word hour is phonetically tran-
scribed as a TRIPHTHONG (i.e. a vowel with three vowel 
qualities) [aua] but it would be a travesty to suggest that an 
utterance of this word consists of an initial period during 
which the tongue-body is depressed and the lips spread; a 
middle period in which the tongue is humped up in the back 
of the mouth and the lips pursed; and a final period in which 
the tongue has an intermediate shape and the lips are spread 

Phonetics and phonology

again. We humans do not have tongues and lips which are 
controlled by ratchets which click instantaneously from one 
configuration to another in that fashion; rather, throughout 
the utterance of hour the configurations of the tongue and 
lips are constantly changing, in complex ways, without 
stable intervals. 
Furthermore, 
the fact that the vocal organs are 
controlled by muscles rather than clicking mechanical 
ratchets, means that speech sounds (or, to be precise, the 
separate articulatory gestures of which speech sounds are 
composed) are much more similar to colours which shade 
into each other gradually than to chemical elements which 
are sharply, discretely different. In terms of English orthog-
raphy it makes no sense to talk of a letter halfway between 
a k and a t; phonetically, however, it is perfectly reasonable 
to talk of a sound somewhere in between [k] and [t]. For 
instance, a palatal stop [c] could be so described. But even 
the three phonetic symbols [k c t] do no more than crudely 
indicate three broad areas at which the tongue may make 
contact with the roof of the mouth. 
This is the reason: between the ends of the upper teeth 
and the uvula (the fleshy bit of your anatomy hanging down 
from the middle of the soft palate at the very back of the 
roof of your mouth beyond the velum (see [1.2])) there is 
an infinity of slightly different areas against which the 
tongue can make a total closure and, at the same time, the 
areas of the tongue involved in contact vary continuously 
rather than discretely. 
The implication of the continuously, rather than 
discretely varying nature of articulatory parameters is that, 
even if stretches of speech could be chopped up into separate 
'sounds', there would not be a limited inventory of possible 
sounds. Rather, the range of pronounceable sounds is as 
infinitely variable as the range of possible shades of colour, 
and the number of different objects one chooses to label 
with distinct colour-names - or phonetic symbols - depends 
purely on how finely one wishes or is able to discriminate. 
Let us ignore for one moment the problems of 
segmenting an utterance into a sequence of sounds. Admit-
tedly, although the range of physically possible sounds is 
infinite, within any one language only a small, finite set of 
sounds is used. For instance, in English there are no speech-

66 
Phonological representations 
sounds, such as clicks, implosives or ejectives, which are 
made otherwise than with the pulmonic egressive airstream 
mechanism; there are no front rounded vowels like the [y] 
in French words such as lu, and so on. But equally clearly, 
within the range of sounds that do occur in a given 
language, all the same arguments about variation will apply 
- so that the range of slightly different sounds produced by 
English speakers will be enormous, even though that range 
is only a small part of the more extensive range of sounds 
which are produced by speakers of all the languages of the 
world. 
Finally, we come to point (iii). The English version of 
the Roman alphabet has just twenty-six letters; but, of 
course, speakers of English produce a lot more that twenty-
six physically distinct sounds. Often, sounds that are 
different are represented using the same letter. In learning 
to spell, we learn to think of the first sound of say, car as 
the 'same' as the first sound of keys although they are not 
phonetically identical (see section 2.I.I). This is mis-
leading. 
4.2 The domain of phonology 
In terms of the physical properties of speech, then, sounds 
are endlessly diverse, and the appearance of a few discrete 
units suggested by the Roman alphabet is seriously 
misleading. To study phonetics is, partly, to learn to 
penetrate beyond that fiction to the chaotic wealth of 
slightly different sounds that we actually use. However, if 
we turn from considering the physical properties of speech-
sounds to thinking about how they FUNCTION in a 
language as a communicative system, the picture suggested 
by the traditional orthography becomes rather more appro-
priate. It is this alternative approach to speech-sounds, 
examining them from the point of view of how they are 
actually USED in different languages, which is adopted by 
the student of PHONOLOGY. 
What I mean by saying that the alphabet-based analysis 
of speech-sounds is reasonably adequate from a functional 
point of view is that, if we think of phonetic variation in 
connection with the work it does in language, then it ceases 

The domain of phonology 
67 
to be true that variation is continuous and not discrete. The 
phonetic symbols [t c k], we noted earlier, impose a three-
way classification on what is physically an infinitely graded 
series of slightly different areas of the palate where the 
tongue can make contact. But the English language, as a 
tool of communication, imposes an even cruder classifi-
cation on that series, treating it as if it had only two 
members t and k, with no in-between sound. 
That does not mean that the initial sound in every 
utterance of a word such as tea, time, tell, etc., involves 
exactly the same area of contact between the tongue and the 
roof of the mouth; it does not mean that the tongue makes 
contact with exactly the same part of the roof of the mouth 
in the articulation of the k sound at the beginning of key, 
coal etc. Speakers could no more achieve that sort of consist-
ency in their speech than darts players could manage to 
place the dart at exactly the same point on the dartboard as 
the dart before it. 
To discover in a practical way what this means, find 
a dozen different words beginning with a t and a k sound 
respectively. Identify the exact points of contact between 
the tongue and the roof of the mouth when you say each 
one of the words which you have chosen. 
You will notice that the sounds tend to cluster into two 
groups, rather in the same way that the holes made in the 
dartboard would cluster into two groups if the players were 
attempting to aim for one or other of two points selected 
as targets. Furthermore, speakers of English have learned 
as hearers to listen for the phonetic 'targets' and not the 
precise phonetic properties of each sound, so that if a 
speaker uttered in the middle of an utterance a 'word' which 
is transcribable as [cul] or [tul], with an initial sound inter-
mediate between [k] and [t], and if it were perceived as such 
by the hearer, it would be dismissed as a mistake. What is 
more likely is that the 'word' would be perceived as a rather 
unsuccessful or inelegant way of saying [tul] tool or [kul] 
cool, whichever seemed appropriate in the context. 
The view that the phoneme is a TARGET SOUND 
in the minds of speakers and hearers was originally 

68 
Phonological representations 
proposed by the Polish linguist Baudouin de Courtenay in 
1894. He suggested that much of the precise phonetic detail 
that is physically present in speech (from an articulatory or 
acoustic point of view) is irrelevant from a FUNCTIONAL 
point of view. 
In the intellectual climate of the first half of this 
century, especially in America, de Courtenay's mentalist 
definition of the phoneme was rejected by most linguists. 
Because they considered themselves empirical scientists, 
they saw no value in speculating about the workings of the 
invisible mind (Twaddell 1935:57). 
While objections to the mentalist approach to the 
phoneme cannot be ignored, it does nonetheless seem to 
offer some useful insights. If you say tea and key, for 
example, there will inevitably be some very slight difference 
in the way you produce the first consonant on various 
occasions but all that matters is that each time these words 
begin with an articulation whose target is either /t/ or /k/. 
Another language may well have three targets on this 
particular dimension (indeed, many languages have). 
Variation in the physical execution of a given phonetic 
target need not be random. For instance, of the two English 
clusters of tongue/palate contact-areas just discussed, the 
area I am calling the /k/ cluster, if it could be plotted, 
would turn out to involve a scatter not round a single point 
but round a line. This is because, typically, velar consonants 
preceding front vowels tend to be made with contact farther 
forward on the soft palate than velar consonants preceding 
relatively back vowels (section 2.1.1). 
You can verify this by pronouncing the following 
words very carefully and observing the movement of your 
tongue: 
[4.3] car key 
King Cole 
keep cool 
Ken Carr 
I hope you observed that the k's in car, cool, Cole and 
Carr are made farther back than those in key, keep, King and 
Ken. 
Although this variation in the k sound is systematic 

Phonetic and phonemic transcription 
69 
rather than random, it is not functionally significant. The 
distinction between a fronted k and a more back k cannot 
be used to contrast word meaning in English. It is not 
phonemic. Fronted [k] (see [4.7] below) and nonfronted [k] 
are allophones of the same phoneme. Phonology focuses on 
functional differences. Phonology is sometimes referred to 
as FUNCTIONAL PHONETICS. 
4.3 Recapitulation: levels of representation 
To sum up the discussion so far, we recognise at least two 
distinct levels of representation of speech: the PHONETIC 
LEVEL and the PHONEMIC LEVEL. At the PHONETIC 
LEVEL, our task is to provide an accurate description of 
the characteristics of the sounds that occur in speech; at the 
PHONOLOGICAL LEVEL the emphasis is on those prop-
erties of sounds that are functionally significant in the 
formation of words and utterances. 
4.4 Phonetic and phonemic transcription 
We have seen in the preceding sections the ways in which 
the standard orthography fails to provide an adequate 
representation of speech. In this section we are going to see 
how the use of PHONETIC and PHONEMIC TRAN-
SCRIPTION might improve matters. In addition to intro-
ducing you to transcription, this section is intended to 
familiarise you with aspects of the consonant system of 
English. The section should also serve as a practical 
demonstration of the use of phoneme theory which was 
introduced in Chapter 2. 
Phonemic transcription (also called BROAD TRAN-
SCRIPTION) only shows functional differences, i.e. differ-
ences between sounds which are used to distinguish word 
meaning. It only uses enough symbols to represent each 
phoneme of the language in question with a symbol of its 
own. Phonetic transcription (also called NARROW TRAN-
SCRIPTION) on the other hand, is much more detailed and 
attempts to provide a more faithful representation of speech. 
It normally represents the allophones of a phoneme that 

70 
Phonological representations 
occur in various contexts, but can be made to show even 
finer detail, if necessary. To do this it uses a much larger 
number of symbols together with diacritic marks to 
distinguish subtle nuances of pronunciation. In [4.4] and 
[4.5] I exemplify broad and narrow transcription respectively: 
[4.4] Broad transcription 
attend 
/atend/ 
two 
/tu/ 
eighth 
/eit/ 
seat 
/sit/ 
nutmeg /nAtmeg/ 
[4.5] Narrow transcription 
[athend] the raised 
(h) shows 
ASPIRATION 
i.e. there is a slight delay between the release of 
the stop [t] and the onset of voicing in the vowel 
[e]. An aspirated stop is released with greater 
force than a unaspirated one. 
[twu] 
the raised 
(w) shows lip-rounding (the 
speaker starts rounding the lips before 
the 
production of [t] is completed in anticipation of 
the vowel [u] which is made with rounded lips. 
[eitG] the subscript (_) marks dental sounds; here, 
in anticipation of the dental fricative [8], the 
tongue makes contact with the upper front teeth 
rather than the alveolar ridge. 
[si?t] the symbol (9) marks pre-glottalisation. 
There is glottal reinforcement - with a glottal 
stop coinciding with or slightly anticipating the 
allophone of ft/ 
that occurs in word final 
position. 
The 
airstream 
is 
simultaneously 
obstructed at two points like a river dammed at 
two points. In some accents the word ends in a 
glottal stop, with no [t] element at all. 
[nA^tmeg]1 the symbol (?) again marks pre-glot-
talisation; that is glottal reinforcement when [t] 
is followed by another consonant. 
The various t sounds are in complementary distri-
bution, each one has got its special contexts in which it occurs. 
They are allophones of the phoneme /t/. Below I have 
written informal rules stating the distribution of these 
allophones: 

Phonetic and phonemic transcription 
71 
[4.6] /t/ is realised as: 
[th], 
an aspirated voiceless alveolar stop when 
it occurs at the beginning of a stressed 
syllable as in [athend]; 
[tw], 
a labialised (rounded) voiceless alveolar 
stop before rounded vowels; 
The word two also has a voiceless aspir-
ated alveolar stop and we could have 
written it phonetically as [twh]. But, as 
you can see, diacritics can crowd each 
other out. For the sake of clarity we may 
use 
only 
those 
diacritics 
that 
are 
necessary to clarify the point we wish to 
focus on; 
[t], 
a dental alveolar voiceless stop before 
dentals; 
[?t], 
a glottalised alveolar stop in word final 
position or before another consonant. 
In order to describe the allophones of a phoneme or to 
make a narrow phonetic transcription you will need to 
know various DIACRITICS devised by phoneticians for 
this purpose. An annotated list of common diacritics is 
provided in [4.7]. 
[4.7] o VOICELESS: examples (voiceless) [ g a] This 
indicates that a segment type that is normally 
fully voiced is fully or partially devoiced (e.g. 
in English, word-final voiced stops like /g/ are 
realised as [g] as in bag [baeg]. 
h ASPIRATED: examples (as°pirated) [ph th kh] 
This indicates that a segment is aspirated (e.g. 
voiceless stops in English are aspirated when 
they occur at the beginning of a stressed 
syllable in words like [athend] attend, [phet] pet 
and [khaet] cat). 
w LABIALISED: examples (labialised) \pw tw kw\ 
It indicates labialisation (lip-rounding) (e.g. 
non-labial 
consonants 
followed 
by 
round 
vowels are labialised in English words like 
[twu] two and [kwul] cool). 
SYLLABIC: examples (syllabic) [1] and [n] 

72 
Phonological representations 
It indicates that a consonant functions as a 
syllable nucleus (e.g. in English the nasals and 
[1] are syllabic when they occur at the end of 
a word if they are preceded by another conso-
nant as in [ketj] kettle and [kDtn] cotton). 
r RHOTACISED (i.e. r-coloured) 
It indicates that a vowel has 'r-colouring' (e.g. 
the pronunciation of words such as [kaJ] car 
and [kaJt] cart in American and English west 
country accents). 
+ shows that a segment is FRONTED 
(e.g. velar is made with the back of the tongue 
moved forward close to the hard palate when 
it is followed by a front vowel as in [ki] key). 
~ NASALISED 
+ 
It indicates that air escapes through the nose as 
in American [psen] pan or French [b5] bon. 
: LONG 
It shows that a segment is long (e.g. the vowel 
in the word see [si] can alternatively be tran-
scribed as [i:]2). 
The list in [4.7] is not exhaustive but it contains most 
of the diacritics you are likely to need frequently. For a 
more comprehensive list refer to the IPA chart in [1.13] in 
the first chapter. 
4.5 A guide to phonetic transcription 
This 
section 
contains 
a few 
practical 
hints 
about 
transcription. 
(i) Start by reading the word or passage aloud several 
times in a manner which is as close as possible to 
natural conversation. If possible, make a recording 
of your reading so that when doing the transcrip-
tion you work from the recording. This is because 
it is virtually imposisble to repeat an utterance 
consistently from one time to the next. 
When working with informants, do not start 
transcribing until you can mimic their pronunci-
ation to their satisfaction. 

Why study phonology? 
73 
(ii) Write on alternate lines. 
(iii) Avoid using letters of the alphabet (such as the 
capital letter A) which are not part of the phonetic 
alphabet. Avoid using capital letters (at the begin-
ning of sentences or in proper names) because they 
may have a different phonetic value from that of 
lower case letters, e.g. [n] is an alveolar nasal but 
[N] is a uvular nasal. 
(iv) Do not confuse the spelling of a word with its 
pronunciation. 
(v) Mark off intonation group boundaries using vertical 
lines like these | | 
e.g. | The aim of this exercise \ is to identify some of the 
phonemes in your speech \ 
(vi) Avoid confusion. Do not use any of the standard 
punctuation marks like question marks, because 
many of them have a different value in the phonetic 
alphabet e.g. the colon [:] represents length; the 
symbol for a glottal stop ['] is like a question mark 
[?] without the dot, etc. 
(vii) If you are transcribing English, remember that 
unstressed vowels are in most cases realised as [a] 
(or [i] or [u]). E.g. [banaena], not *[baenaen£e], for 
banana. 
(viii) You may mark off those syllables which carry stress 
by a raised, small vertical line before the syllable 
carrying the main stress of a word, e.g. ['enta] enter. 
Where in addition to a main stress there is a 
secondary stress, you can mark it with a lowered 
vertical line, e.g. [,dAbled3d] double-edged. 
4.6 Why study phonology? 
In this chapter we have seen that it is necessary to recognise 
at least two levels of speech representation: the phonetic and 
the phonemic. We have further seen that corresponding to 
each level there is a system of transcription, namely 
phonemic (broad) and narrow (phonetic) transcription. But 
you might still wonder why anyone should be interested in 
working out ways of representing speech, other than the 
standard orthography which, in spite of its limitations, has 

74 
Phonological representations 
served us so well. In the closing remarks of this chapter, I 
briefly address this question. 
First there is the theoretical motivation: theoretical 
linguists are interested in exploring the ways in which 
language uses the medium of sound, which is in itself mean-
ingless (a sound like [t] or [e] in itself means nothing) to 
build words which convey an infinite range of meanings. 
They are interested in the restrictions on the ways in which 
sounds can combine to form words; they are interested in 
the ways in which phonology relates to grammar and 
meaning. They are interested in both the language-specific 
and universal dimensions of these questions. 
The answers to these questions are relevant to other 
areas of linguistics. 
(a) Psycholinguists investigate the acquisition of phono-
logical knowledge by infants and the disintegration of 
that knowledge in aphasia (the loss of linguistic ability 
through brain damage) - these are windows through 
which the nature of human cognition in general can be 
glimpsed. 
(b) Historical linguists investigate the evolution of sound 
systems 
because 
it provides 
the surest evidence 
of 
languages sharing common descent. (For example, / p / in 
Latin words like pater and piscis corresponds to /f/ in the 
English words father 
and fish which have the same 
meaning). There tends to be a significant degree of sound-
meaning correspondence between languages descended 
from a common ancestor. 
(c) Sociolinguists 
investigate 
the correlation 
between 
geographical dialect, social sub-groupings and pronunci-
ation. (For example, in England, middle-class speakers of 
English are very much less likely than their working-class 
counterparts to drop their aitches initially in nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs and pronounce the words heat, and hat, 
for instance, as [it] and [ast] respectively, rather than [hit] 
and [haet]. Both sociolinguists and historical linguists, for 
instance, attempt to explain why look and luck rhyme in 
the North of England, both being pronounced [luk], but 
not elsewhere, and why [hsum] home and [staon] stone 
are pronounced as [he:m] and [ste:n] in Scotland. 
For all these groups of linguists it is essential to be able 

Why study phonology? 
75 
to understand the workings of the spoken language. At the 
very least, they all need to be able to make adequate broad 
and narrow transcriptions of spoken language data so that 
they have a proper representation of the subject matter 
which they examine. 
Phonetics and phonology are not esoteric academic 
disciplines with no relevance to the real world. Beyond the 
confines of linguistics, there are many kinds of specialists 
working with language who need to be able to analyse and 
represent speech in a more sophisticated way than that 
provided by the standard orthography. They include 
literacy experts, especially those devising orthographies for 
unwritten languages (a famous book on phonemics by 
Kenneth Pike has the sub-title 'a technique for reducing 
languages to writing'). An orthography ensuring that there is 
just one symbol for every contrastive sound in a language 
is ideal for writing down a language and introducing 
literacy to a speech community. Even for a written language 
like English, literacy workers wishing to understand the 
problems of their pupils or clients need to have the grasp 
of spoken English and its relationship with the standard 
orthography which is derived from a study of phonology. 
Not least because often spelling mistakes - 
such as 
misspelling feel as feeyal - can be understood and remedied 
if the instructor realises that phonetically that word is 
frequently pronounced as [fijsl]. The incorrect spelling is, 
in fact, phonetically well motivated. 
For teachers of foreign languages, too, a good under-
standing of phonetics and phonology is desirable, for it 
facilitates the diagnosis of learners' errors and provides the 
concepts and notation needed to represent accurately both 
the learner's speech and the target pronunciation. 
Actors need to be convincing mimics of a wide range 
of accents. An understanding of the phonological charac-
teristics of social and geographical dialects hinted at above 
is invaluable in that profession. Phonetics (in some form) 
is usually one of the subjects studied at drama school. 
Speech therapists treat patients with speech defects 
which sometimes are due to inability to produce certain 
sounds, or a failure to produce certain allophones of 
phonemes, or again a failure to master some principles that 
govern phonological patterning. Not only do they need to 

76 
Phonological representations 
be able to transcribe their raw data phonetically and analyse 
aspects of their patients' pathological speech case histories, 
but they need also to have a thorough knowledge of normal 
phonological behaviour which their patients are exepcted to 
approximate. For the same reasons, specialists in speech 
hearing science and teachers of the deaf need to have a good 
understanding of phonetics and phonology in order to 
enable their speech-impaired clients to communicate using 
the spoken language. 
Neurologists and neurolinguists often have to treat 
aphasics (brain-damaged patients) who have lost the ability 
to produce or process the spoken language but who may, 
in some cases, have retained the ability to communicate 
through the written word. They need to know how speech 
is produced and heard, they need to know about the neuro-
logical wiring responsible for speech, and they need to 
know how sounds are organised in speech, in order to help 
restore speech in their patients. 
Speech is a very important personality trait: in 
everyday life we all make judgements about people on the 
basis of how they talk. We can judge whether they are 
lugubrious, excitable or depressed on the basis of their voice 
quality, volume, tempo, and so on. In a professional 
context, psychiatrists can diagnose certain mental abnor-
malities by focusing their attention on these and other 
aspects of speech. 
The police, too, in recent years have increasingly used 
'forensic phonetics' in order to track down suspects on the 
basis of their geographical dialect, occupation and social 
class as well as physical characteristics such as sex, age and 
size which can be established on the basis of their speech. 
But although the popular press speaks of 'voice prints' 
which are supposedly as individual as finger prints, phone-
ticians are much more cautious. The contribution of 
phonetics in this area is still modest. 
It is probably in the development of modern communi-
cations that phonetics has had the greatest impact. Alex-
ander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, was a 
Scottish phonetician, like his father and grandfather before 
him. Initially, like his father and grandfather, he was inter-
ested in clinical applications of phonetics, but later he 
realised that phonetics had other uses. He emigrated to 

Why study phonology? 
77 
America and there his invention, the telephone, was devel-
oped and marketed by the Bell Telephone Company. To 
this day, the Bell Telephone Laboratories in America remain 
at the forefront of acoustic phonetics research. 
Communications engineers are interested in increasing 
the efficiency of telephone systems. To a great extent this 
means cutting out redundant, non-distinctive aspects of 
speech so that more messages can be carried on their 
networks without reducing the level of clarity and intelli-
gibility. To do this effectively, a good model of the physics 
of speech has to be complemented by an equally sophisti-
cated understanding of phonological systems. 
More recently, there has been a surge of interest in 
speech processing by computer. Acoustic phonetics and 
phonology are both central disciplines in the production of 
synthesised speech and the decoding of spoken language 
using computers. Both have great future promise. Once 
computers are capable of inputting and transcribing spoken 
language and producing good quality synthesised speech, 
they will possibly become as easy to use and as ubiquitous 
as the telephone. The commercial possibilities of talking 
computers which give verbal responses to questions, in 
naturalistic plain speech, without the user needing to spend 
hours tied to the keyboard, have attracted massive invest-
ment in phonetics research in the last few years. 
But even if the study of the spoken language had 
absolutely no practical applications it would still be an 
important discipline because it is central to understanding 
who we are. More than anything, the ability to speak, the 
ability to use language is what sets us apart from the rest 
of the animal kingdom.

There 
is some 
controversy 
surrounding 
English 
vowels. Some regard the basic distinction as that 
between long and short vowels and hence transcribe 
them as /i: u: a: o:/, the set of long vowels, which is 
opposed to /i u ae D/, the set of short vowels. Others 
regard the quality difference as more basic and think 
the features tense/lax bring this out more appropri-
ately. They would prefer to use the symbols /i u a 
D/ for the tense vowels and /i u ae D/ for the lax vowels. 
It is the latter position which is adopted in this book. 

CHAPTER 5 
Phonological processes 
5.1 Introduction 
The phonological systems of different languages are obvi-
ously different. No two languages have exactly the same 
inventory of phonemes which are realised by the same set 
of allophones; no two languages have exactly the same 
phonological rules regulating the deployment of their 
sounds. However, while all that is true, it would be wrong 
to ignore the similarites between languages because they are 
no less impressive than the differences. In the discussion of 
phonological symmetry in Chapter 2, we noted that 
languages tend to exploit the same phonetic parameters in 
building their phonological systems and that there are 
certain patterns that recur frequently. 
In Chapter 3 we observed that it is feasible to use a 
relatively small number of DISTINCTIVE FEATURES 
like [± back], [± high], [± low], [± round], f± voice] etc. 
to characterise the phonological contrasts found in all the 
world's languages. One possible explanation for this is the 
fact that human anatomy and physiology impose limits on 
the range of sounds which people can produce as speakers 
and discriminate as hearers. Thus, for instance, since no 
human is endowed with a tongue which is so long that the 
tip can curl all the way back to the throat, it is safe to 
predict that no language has apico-uvular consonants made 
with the tip of the tongue and the uvula as the articulators 
(the uvula is the fleshy bit that hangs down from the centre 
of the soft palate at the very back of the mouth). On the 
other hand, given the ease with which the tip and the blade 
of the tongue can be raised towards the upper front teeth 
and the teeth ridge, it is not surprising to discover that all 

80 
Phonological processes 
languages have either dental or alveolar sounds, if not both. 
Distinctive feature theory claims that there is a universal 
inventory of phonological construction materials 
from 
which various languages chose different elements which 
they use in building their phonological systems. Alterna-
tively, distinctive features can be likened to cooking ingre-
dients on a supermarket shelf. The selection of ingredients 
that a particular language puts in its shopping basket 
depends on the recipe which it wishes to concoct. (Of 
course, I do not mean this in a literal sense. Languages 
cannot be credited with intentional behaviour!) 
It is significant, but not unexpected, that the phono-
logical recipes which are available fall within the range 
permitted by human biology. What is intriguing is the fact 
that not everything that is biologically possible is equally 
likely to occur. Within the range of possible sounds, certain 
articulatory parameters are exploited by languages much 
more commonly than others. 
Furthermore, besides exhibiting similarities in the 
features they use in structuring their sounds, languages also 
show other phonological similarities. For example, although 
the phonological 
systems 
of different 
languages 
are 
governed by different rules, the variation which occurs 
does, for the most part, fall within certain parameters. 
Similar phonological processes turn up, in language after 
language. 
5.2 Assimilation 
In Chapter 2 we saw that often in language a phoneme has 
several allophones, with the allophone selected in a 
particular position being dependent on the other sounds that 
are adjacent to it. The commonest phonological process 
responsible for this is ASSIMILATION. Assimilation, as 
you will recall from the discussion in Chapter 3, is the 
modification of a sound in order to make it more similar 
to some other sound in its neighbourhood. The advantage 
of having assimilation is that it results in smoother, more 
effortless, more economical transitions from one sound to 
another. It facilitates the task of speaking. The speaker 
usually tries to conserve energy by using no more effort 

Assimilation 
81 
than is necessary to produce an utterance. (Guardians of 
linguistic good taste in a speech community might view 
many instances of assimilation as nothing less than culpable 
sloppiness. But their admonitions 'to uphold standards' tend 
to go largely unheeded.) 
Usually, the alternation in the phonological realisations 
of a MORPHEME (i.e. minimal meaningful or distribu-
tional unit in a language, which may be a simple word like 
dog, or a suffix like the -s plural marker in dogs, or the nega-
tive prefix un- in un-do) can be accounted for in terms of 
assimilation. 
Consider the regular plural ending in English. It is 
written as s, but it may, in fact, be pronounced as [-s] as 
in [pet-s] pets, or as [-z] as in [bel-z] bells or even as [-iz] 
as in [rauz-iz] roses. The choice is not random. The principle 
that determines the shape of the suffix is VOICE ASSIMI-
LATION: this suffix must always agree in voicing with the 
preceding sound. Turning voicing on and keeping it on 
throughout, or alternatively, not turning voicing on at all 
is much easier than the alternative of turning it on or off 
part-way through a sequence of sounds. 
More data is provided in [5.1] to illustrate the pattern 
of alternation of the plural ending. Study the data and 
answer the questions which follow:

(a) Add five more examples of your own to each 
column. 
(b) Suggest a rule to predict the shape of the ALLO-
MORPH (i.e. alternative realisation of the morpheme) that 
occurs with the nouns in each column. 

82 
Phonological processes 
If you have answered [5.1] correctly, you have estab-
lished that the English plural suffix has the following 
allomorphs: 
[5-2l 
W [_z] 
occurring with the words in column 
A 
(ii) [-s] 
occurring with the words in column 
B 
(iii) [-iz] 
occurring with the words in column 
C 
Typically, as these examples show, the alternation in 
the shape of a morpheme is not arbitrary. Rather, it is 
PHONOLOGICALLY CONDITIONED. This means that 
the allomorph of a morpheme that occurs in a given context 
is partly or wholly determined by the sounds found in the 
allomorphs of adjacent morphemes. It is not merely coinci-
dence that is responsible for the allomorphs of the plural 
morpheme and the third person plural being [-z -s -iz]. The 
suffix AGREES IN VOICING with the preceding sound. 
We shall provisionally state the rule thus: 
the plural suffix is realised by a voiced or voiceless 
alveolar fricative depending on whether the noun ends in 
a voiced or voiceless segment. (The rule will be embel-
lished presently to take into account the forms in column 
C.) 
Note that this voice assimilation is not an idiosyncratic 
property of the plural morpheme. It is a rule that applies 
more generally to English suffixes consisting of plosives or 
fricatives (i.e. obstruents). For instance, the /-z/ suffix, 
whether it is the noun plural marker as in [5.1], or the third 
person singular present tense suffix, shows the same pattern 
of alternation. You can verify this by examining [5.3]:

Assimilation 
83 
Instead of listing separately the three allomorphs of the 
plural morpheme and those of the third person singular 
present tense morpheme (and for that matter, of any other 
regular, 
phonologically 
conditioned 
morpheme 
in 
any 
language), we can posit a single UNDERLYING REPRE-
SENTATION (or BASE FORM) which is entered in the 
'DICTIONARY'. The various allomorphs can be derived 
by rule from that underlying representation. 
In this case, if we assume that the base form of the 
noun plural suffix is /-z/, and if we further assume that the 
base form 
of the third person singular present 
tense 
morpheme is also /-z/, we can derive the various allo-
morphs of each morpheme using the informal 
VOICE 
ASSIMILATION rules in [5.4]: 
[5.4] English voice assimilation 
(i) 
The underlying, dictionary 
representation 
of the plural and of the third person singular 
present tense markers is /-z/. 
(ii) 
Insert [1] (or [a]) after any root ending in a 
sibilant (i.e. a sound such as [s z J" tf d3] 
which has high pitched fricative noise). See 
words like witch in column C in (5.1). 
(iii) 
Make sure that the suffix agrees in voicing 
with the segment preceding it. After a 
voiceless segment, like the final [k] of dock, 
the underlying /-z/ is changed to [s] so that 
the 
root 
and 
the 
suffix 
become 
more 
similar: /dok-z/ —> [dr>k-s]. See words in 
column B in (5.1). 
(iv) 
After a root that ends in a voiced segment 
like a vowel or like the voiced stop / g / in 
dog the suffix is realised as [z], which is also 
voiced, i.e. the underlying /-z/ in that case 
surfaces unmodified: 
/dDg-z/ -> [dDgz] 
Sec the words in column A in (5.1). 
(v) 
Likewise, 
after 
the vowel 
[1] has 
been 
inserted after roots ending in a sibilant, the 
underlying /-z/ is realised as [z] so that it 
agrees in voicing with [1]: 
/wDtf/ —> [wDtf-l/ -> [wDtJ-lz/. 
See words in column C in (5.1). 

84 
Phonological processes 
In the next section we shall explore some general issues 
regarding assimilation before returning to voice assimilation 
in 5.3.3 below. 
5.2.1 Direction of assimilation 
When discussing assimilation, it is useful to look at 
processes in terms of DIRECTIONALITY, i.e. we can say 
whether a sound becomes more like either the sound that 
precedes it or the sound that follows it. If a sound 
becomes more like the sound that precedes it, the process 
is called REGRESSIVE assimilation; if, on the other hand, 
a sound is modified so that it becomes more like the sound 
that follows it, the process is called PROGRESSIVE 
assimilation. 
In all the English examples above, the suffix consonant 
is made to agree in voicing with the root segment that 
precedes it. Hence, the rule of suffix voice agreement is an 
instance of regressive assimilation. 
Now consider the following examples from Luganda 
(Uganda) and determine the direction of assimilation. 
[5. 5]m-bala 
m-pa 
m-mala 
n-daga 
n-sika 
n-nejia 
I count 
I give 
I finish 
I show 
I pull 
I blame 
n-tema 
ji-Jagala 
ji-jiumya 
ji-coppa 
rj-kola 
0-gula 
I cut 
I like 
I converse 
I become destitute 
I work 
I buy 
You will have observed how, in these data, the nasal 
always shares the place of articulation of the consonant that 
follows it. Anticipating the place of articulation of the 
following consonant, the speaker adjusts the place of articu-
lation of the nasal. The direction of assimilation in [5.5] is 
PROGRESSIVE (also called ANTICIPATORY): 
[5.6] The nasal is realised as 
(i) 
[m] before bilabial consonants (e.g. when 
one of [p b m] follows) 

Assimilation 
85 
(ii) 
[n] before alveolar consonants (e.g. when 
one of [t d n s] follows) 
(iii) 
[ji] before palatal consonants (e.g. when one 
of [c J ji] follows) 
(iv) 
[rj] before velar consonants (e.g. when [k or 
g] follows) 
Stop reading and write down at least two fresh exam-
ples from English (or any other language you know) which 
exemplify progressive and regressive assimilation. 
Examine the data [5.7], again taken from Luganda, and 
determine 
whether 
the 
direction 
of assimilation 
is 
progressive or regressive. 
[5.7] A 
Pakulagrab! (imp.) 
Palacount! (imp.) 
ka-Puzismall goat 
ka-Pogo small buffalo 
B 
m-bakula 
m-bala 
m-buzi 
m-bogo 
I grab 
I count 
goat 
buffalo 
The process whereby the nasal is altered to agree in 
place of articulation with the following consonant must be 
viewed 
as anticipatory 
(i.e. progressive) 
assimilation. 
However, if you examine the data closely, you will observe 
that there is another process going on at the same time. The 
bilabial fricative [P] alternates with a plosive: the fricative 
occurs word initially (see column A) while the plosive [b], 
which shares the same places of articulation, occurs after a 
nasal (see column B). The fricative, which is a continuant, 
assimilates the property of being noncontinuant (i.e. being 
a stop) from the nasal immediately preceding it. 
What [5.7] shows is BIDIRECTIONAL assimilation. 
The nasal prefix assimilation rule which ensures that all 
nasals have the same place of articulation as the following 
consonant exemplifies progressive assimilation; but the 
STRENGTHENING of continuants so that they are real-
ised as stops when they are preceded by a nasal stop is an 
example of regressive assimilation. 

86 
Phonological processes 
5.3 Assimilation processes 
Another way in which assimilation processes can be seen 
is in terms of whether a vowel or consonant acquires vowel 
or consonant features of a neighbouring segment. Various 
patterns are examined in turn below. The coverage is not 
intended to be exhaustive. It is only meant to show some 
of the commonest assimilation processes found in the 
languages of the world. 
5.3.1 Palatalisation 
Say the following words and describe the position of your 
tongue during the production of the first consonant in each 
one of them: 
[5.8] key 
[ki] car [ka] 
then say: 
[ka kiz] 
keep [kip] calm [kam] 
[kip kam] 
get 
[get] garlic [galik] 
[get gahk] 
give [giv] guns [gAnz] 
[giv gAnz] 
Observe that, in each case when a velar consonant is 
followed by a front vowel, there occurs some slight antici-
patory fronting of the part of the tongue that makes contact 
with the roof of the mouth. This fronting is indicated by 
a subscript (+) under the consonant. The effect of the 
fronting is that the velar consonant is made partly in the 
palatal region. This process is called PALATALISATION. 
Velar consonants often have slightly palatalised allophones 
which occur after front vowels because the tongue is raised 
towards the hard palate in the production of front vowels 
and speakers anticipate that gesture and start making it 
before they have completed the articulation of [k] or [g]. 
Palatalisation is not limited to velar consonants. It is 
equally possible to palatalise anterior consonants. In fast, 
causal spoken English, for instance, alveolar consonants are 
usually palatalised when they occur at the end of a word and 
are followed by another word which begins with an alveo-
palatal consonant: 
[5.9] his shoes 
[hiz Juz] 
—» [hi3 Juz] 
nice shirt 
[nais J3t] 
—» [naij" /3t] 
miss Ure 
[mis jua] 
—» [mif jua] 
John's shorts [d3Dnz Jots] —* [d3Dn3 Jots] 

Assimilation processes 
87 
Now use the notion of palatalisation to help account 
for the alternative pronunciations of the words in [5.10]. 
[5.10] 
A
B
C 
issue 
[ISJU] 
~ [ijju] 
~ [iju] 
consume 
[kansjum] ~ [kanjjum] ~ [kanjum] 
Add at least two more examples of your own. 
If the forms in A are taken as the CITATION FORMS that 
would be listed in a dictionary, B can be explained as a case 
of palatalisation. The speaker, anticipating the palatal 
approximant which follows, places the tongue in the alveo-
palatal region instead of the alveolar region. In C the 
speaker once again anticipates the palatal approximant and 
has the tongue making contact with the alveo-palatal region 
and drops the [j] sound which triggered off the palatalis-
ation in the first place. 
5.3.2 Labialisation 
Palatalisation is not the only vowel feature which can be 
acquired by consonants. Say the words in [5.11] and then 
get another person to say them. Watch your partner's lips 
very carefully. Describe the lip position adjustment process 
which you observe as the initial consonant of each pair of 
words in A and B is said. 
peel 
tea 
she 
leek 
get 
A 
[Pil] 
[«] 
[Ji] 
[Hk] 
[get] 
pool 
two 
shoe 
Luke 
got 
B 
[pwul] 
|twu| 
[;wui 
[lwukl 
[gW°t] 
In each case, the word in B is said with some degree of 
secondary lip rounding. Anticipating the next segment, 
which is a rounded vowel, the speaker starts rounding the 
lips before the articulation of the consonant is completed. 
This assimilation process is called LABIALISATION or 
(ROUNDING). It can be indicated in a phonetic transcrip-
tion by using the raised w after a consonant [Cw]. 

88 
Phonological processes 
Find two examples of labialisation in any language you 
know and write them down using a narrow phonetic 
transcription. 
5.3.3 Voice assimilation 
You will remember that in section 5.2 of this chapter we 
saw that in English suffixes agree in voicing with the last 
segment of the stem to which they are attached. That is a 
classic example of VOICE ASSIMILATION: whatever 
happens to be the specification for the feature [voice] of the 
preceding segment of the root is automatically carried over 
into the suffix. The relevant examples are not repeated here. 
If you want to refresh your memory, please read section 5.2 
again. 
The phonetic cause of voice assimilation is well-under-
stood. Given the fact that speech is a continuum, the process 
of putting the vocal cords close together to produce voicing 
or keeping them wide apart to produce voicelessness is not 
always perfectly 
synchronised 
with other 
articulatory 
gestures. This may mean voicing spilling over into an 
adjacent segment. This frequently happens where a voiceless 
consonant occurs between two (voiced) vowels. In many 
languages, in that position, 'voiceless' consonants acquire 
a certain amount of voicing. This happened historically as 
Spanish developed from Latin. One of the changes that 
occurred was the voicing of voiceless stops between vowels. 
For instance, Latin fata 'fate' became fada in Spanish. The 
converse situation is also attested. In some languages a 
vowel is devoiced when it occurs between voiceless conson-
ants. That is the case in Japanese in a word like [kita] 
'came'. 
Cast your mind back to the French problem in Chapter 
2. The data is reproduced below for convenience. Recall 
that in French, at the end of a word the LIQUIDS (i.e. /I/ 
and /r/) as well as the nasals agree in voicing with the 
preceding consonant: they are voiced after voiced conson-
ants (as in [5.12]), and voiceless after voiceless ones (as in 
[5.13]):

Examine the data in [5.14] and describe the rule respon-
sible for the voice assimilation in Kalenjin (Kenya) (Toweett 
1975)-

to sew 
nabe:t 
is sewing 
luk 
to fight 
luge:t 
is fighting 
ku:t 
to blow 
ku:te:t 
is blowing 
There is a twist in the data. While labial [p] and velar 
[k] acquire voicing in intervocalic position, alveolar [t] does 
not. It remains voiceless between vowels. 
5.3.4 Place of articulation assimilation 
We saw in [5.6] that in Luganda the place of articulation of 
a nasal is predictable from the place of articulation of the 
consonant that comes after it. 
Now apply the same kind of analysis to the Malay data 
in [5.15] and state the distribution of the allomorphs of the 
agentive nominalising prefix /pan/. This prefix can be 
attached to most verbs to form a noun with a meaning 
similar to that of a noun derived from a verb in English 
using the -er suffix.

In [5.15], the nasal is HOMORGANIC with the 
consonant that goes after it, i.e. the nasal shares the place 
of articulation of the following consonant. Hence the use 
of the label HOMORGANIC NASAL ASSIMILATION 
to refer to this assimilation process. The homorganic nasal 
assimilation rules which were suggested for Luganda in 
[5.6] would also cover Malay. In both languages the assimi-
lation is automatic. It applies wherever a nasal is followed 
by another consonant in the same word. 
Homorganic nasal assimilation also applies in English, 
albeit somewhat sporadically. Compare the two columns in 
[5.16] which show the negative prefixes in- and ir-
respectively: 
[5.16] 
A 
[in] in-appropriate 
[im] im-plausible 
[in] in-decent 
[in] in-gratitute 
B 
[An] un-exciting 
[An] un-pretentious 
[An] un-deserving 
[An] un-grateful 
Add three fresh examples to each column, choosing a 
different consonant after the prefix, but avoiding the 
prefixes ir- and il- (see next section). Say carefully each 
word that you add to the list, noting the changes in the 
place of articulation of the nasal in column A in anticipation 
of the place of articulation of the consonant that follows. 
Assume that the underlying representation of the prefix in 
A is in- since that is the form that appears before vowels, 
a position where there is no phonetic motivation for 

Assimilation processes 
91 
modifying the place of articulation (given the fact that 
vowels have no place of articulation). 
Homorganic nasal assimilation is not an automatic and 
obligatory rule of English phonology. It applies selectively 
to certain forms and is not triggered by phonological infor-
mation alone. There are words which contain nonhomor-
ganic nasals. The homorganic assimilation rule normally 
applies to in- but not to un-, except in casual speech where, 
for example, unkempt and unpleasant may be pronounced 
[Ankempt] and [Amplezant] respectively. 
It is interesting that across word boundaries, in fast 
speech, consonants (especially alveolar ones), can be option-
ally homorganic with the following consonant. There, no 
grammatical restrictions seem to apply: 
[5.17]bad man 
[baed maen] —> [baeb0 maen] 
ten men 
[ten men] —> [tern men] 
what car 
[wDt ka] —> [wDk° ka] 
top ten 
[tDp ten] —» [tDt° ten] 
(C° = 
unreleased stop: normally there is no 
audible release of a stop followed by another 
stop.) 
Find two more examples of assimilation similar to 
those in [5. 17]. 
5.3.5 Manner of articulation assimilation 
In the last section we established that the underlying repre-
sentation of the negative prefix which occurs with adjectives 
in [5.16] must be in-. If that assumption is correct, how can 
we explain the historical development shown in [5.18]? 
[5.18] in-legal 
in-licit 
in-rational 
in-revocable 
—* illegal 
—» illicit 
—» irrational 
—» irrevocable 

92 
Phonological processes 
The answer seems to be that before roots whose first 
consonant is a LIQUID (/l/ or /r/) the nasal of the negative 
prefix assimilates the manner of articulation features of the 
liquid so that /n/ becomes [1] before /l/-commencing roots 
or [r] before /r/-commencing roots. However, this alter-
nation is not purely phonetically conditioned since [n] can 
be followed by [1] or [r] in words such as unloved or unreason-
able. In fact, this is a historical assimilation which took 
place in Latin, and is simply reflected in modern English 
through Latin borrowing. 
An example of a manner of articulation assimilation 
rule which is still active in a contemporary language is given 
in the Cairo Arabic data in [5.19]. The underlying repre-
sentation of the definite article is /il-/. However, it is not 
realised as [il-] in all contexts. Whether it is realised as [il-] 
or as something else depends on the first consonant of the 
root to which it is prefixed. 
Study [5.19] and suggest a rule to account for the realisation 
of the definite article. 
Here is a clue: the definite article is realised as [il-] unless 
the noun to which it is attached shares some place of 
articulation features with /l/. 
[5.19] Cairo Arabic (Harms 1968) 
kursi 
'chair' 
ilkursi 
'the chair' 
dars 
'lesson' 
iddars 
'the lesson' 
innimra 'the grade' ilmudarris 'the teacher'

ilwa:gib 
'the assignment' 
ilba:b 
'the door' ilqism 
'the section' 
issanta 
'the bag' 
ilge:b 
'the pocket' 
We could state the rule this way informally: 
the [1] of the definite article takes on the manner of articu-
lation features of the initial root consonant and becomes 
indistinguishable from it, where like [1], that consonant 
is anterior and coronal (i.e. made at the alveolar place of 
articulation). 
The motivation for this kind of change is not difficult 
to see. Ensuring that segments made at the same place also 

Assimilation processes 
93 
agree in manner of articulation is a way of minimising 
articulatory effort. Instead of making two articulatory 
gestures the speaker only makes one and holds it for a 
longer period. 
5.3.6 Nasalisation 
NASALISATION is a process whereby an oral segment 
acquires nasality from a neighbouring segment. Again, the 
articulatory motivation for this is self-evident. In order to 
produce a nasal segment, it is necessary to lower the velum 
(soft palate) and allow air to escape through the nose (the 
lower the soft palate is, the higher will the degree of nasal-
isation be); to produce an oral sound, it is necessary to 
completely block off access to the nasal cavity by raising the 
velum as high as it can go. Any leakage of air past the 
velum will cause some nasalisation. To maintain an absolute 
distinction between oral and nasal consonants would require 
perfect synchronisation of velic closure with the other articu-
latory parameters of (a) PHONATION (i.e. production 
of voicing), (b) the PLACE OF ARTICULATION and (c) 
the MANNER OF ARTICULATION. This is not always 
possible. Typically some nasalisation seeps through and 
affects an oral segment which is adjacent to a nasal. In many 
languages the nasalisation is prominently audible. Examples 
of nasalised vowels (V) are the sound [e] and [a] in the 
French words [pe] pain 'bread' and [mama] maman 'mum'. 
In Kikuyu (Kenya), vowels have nasal variants which 
occur in the neighbourhood of nasal consonants, as you can 
see in [5.20]:

Historically it is almost certain that nasalisation is 
always a consonant feature which is assimilated by vowels. 
However, in a synchronic description of a language it is 
possible to find vowels which are always nasal and which 

94 
Phonological processes 
must be presumed to be underlyingly nasal. That is the case 
in Yoruba (Nigeria) where nasal vowels occur in the 
absence of nasal consonants in words like [odu] 'year'. At 
one time there would have been a nasal consonant con-
ditioning the vowel nasalisation but it has disappeared. 
5.4 Dissimilation 
We have seen in the preceding section of this chapter that 
assimilation processes typically have a transparent phonetic 
basis that can be stated in terms of ease of articulation. But 
not all phonological processes can be plausibly explained in 
terms of assimilation. If we recognise the fact that phono-
logical systems have to meet the needs of language users 
both as speakers and as hearers, we can easily appreciate that 
while assimilation (by making sounds more similar to each 
other) facilitates speech production, it does also have the 
undesirable effect of making the hearer's task of discrimi-
nating between sounds somewhat more difficult. 
(' Phonological processes which ensure that differences 
between sounds are enhanced so that sounds become more 
auditorily distinct make speech perception easier. DISSI-
MILATION is the term used to refer to processes of that 
kind. The effect of dissimilation is to make sounds more 
distinct from other sounds in their environment. After a 
dissimilation rule has applied, phonological elements are less 
like each other than they were before the rule applied. 
Let us begin by examining a very limited set of data 
from English which illustrates dissimilation. In English, the 
adjective forming suffix -al has two phonetic manifestations. 
Sometimes it is -al, as in column A in [5.21] below and 
sometimes it -ar, as in column B. Bearing in mind the fact 
that dissimilation plays a role in this, study the data and 
describe the factor which determines the allomorph that 
occurs in any particular instance. Pay special attention to the 
last segment of the noun which is adjacent tp the adjective 
ending. Say the words aloud and transcribe the final 
segment phonetically.

The pattern is clear. The shape -al is the base form. It 
is the form which you add in column A where the last 
consonant of the noun is a sound other than [1]. Verify this 
by looking at the transcription which you have made. The 
shape -ar is the alternant which is normally added where the 
last consonant of the noun is [1]. The addition of -al after 
a root ending in [1], which would have resulted in two [1] 
sounds merely separated by a schwa, is thus avoided. But 
like many other rules, this rule has exceptions, e.g. linear 
not *lineal although line does not end in -/. I (Note also in 
passing that in column B, [ju] is inserted between the final 
[1] and the consonant preceding it.) 
The English dissimilation process is another Latin relic. 
It survives in words borrowed from Latin but is not a 
productive rule. It is often difficult to know where to draw 
the line between a synchronically relevant phonological 
process and a historical relic which is no longer relevant. 
We shall return to this problem in Chapter 8. 
For our next example we shall consider a productive 
synchronic dissimilation process. In many Bantu languages 
there is a rule which requires a consonant in a prefix to 
DISAGREE in voicing with the first consonant of the root 
to which it is attached: 
a vbiced stem initial segment requires a voiceless conson-
ant in the prefix and a voiceless stem-initial segment 
requires a voiced consonant in the prefix. 
Consider the Kirundi (Burundi) examples in [5.22]:

This dissimilation rule in Bantu is called Dahl's law, after

5.5 Conclusion 
In this chapter a number of common phonological processes 
have been examined. It has been shown that there are often 
good phonetic reasons for phonological processes. For the 
most part, phonological alternation in the shape of a mor-
pheme has a phonetic motivation and that motivation tends 
to be similar in different languages. This largely explains 
the considerable degree of similarity between the phonolo-
gical patterns found in different languages.

CHAPTER 6 
Naturalness and strength 
6.1 Introduction 
It will have become clear in the last chapter that the alter-
nation in the phonological realisation of morphemes is for 
the most part not arbitrary. The same segment types turn 
up in similar processes found in diverse languages. Phon-
ologists have used the term NATURALNESS to refer to 
the fact that there is, for the most part, a phonetically well-
motivated relationship not only between the allophones of 
a phoneme, but also between the various phonological 
manifestations 
of 
a 
morpheme. 
Naturalness 
can 
be 
approached 
in 
terms 
of 
MARKEDNESS. 
What 
is 
N A T U R A L can be said to be U N M A R K E D , and what is 
not natural can be said to be MARKED, i.e. in some sense 
unusual. The purpose of this chapter is to explore this 
phenomenon. 
6.2 Natural segments, natural classes and natural 
processes 
It is not only classes of sounds which are affected by the 
same phonological processes that tend to be made up of 
segments 
which 
are 
phonetically 
natural. 
Individual 
segments themselves also tend to contain phonetic features 
which are natural. Partly due to physiological constraints, 
not every conceivable combination of features results in 
permissible segments. At a very obvious and trivial level, 
the fact that nobody has lips long enough to make contact 
with the uvular precludes labio-uvular consonants. More 
significant, however, is the fact that not all physically poss-

Natural segments, natural classes and natural processes 
99 
ible feature combinations are equally probable. Certain 
feature combinations are more likely; they are the ones that 
recur again and again in various languages. They are the 
unmarked combinations. 
For instance, voiceless sonorants such as the nasals [m 
n ji rj] are much less common than their voiced counterparts 
[m° n ji rj]. Likewise, voiceless approximants like [w j 1 r] 
are less common than voiced ones. Sounds produced "with 
the velaric airstream mechanism (i.e. clicks) and those 
produced with the glottalic airstream mechanism (i.e. 
implosives and ejectives) are less common than sounds 
produced with the pulmonic airstream mechanism. Front 
rounded vowels are rare (the main concentration of front 
rounded vowels is north-western Europe where they occur 
in languages such as French, German and Swedish) but 
front unrounded vowels are not. Nasalised vowels, though 
widespread, are still much less frequent than their oral coun-
terparts both in the world's languages and in those 
languages where they occur. That certain combinations of 
features are more favoured, more natural than others is 
beyond dispute. We shall consider some possible reasons for 
this at the end of this chapter. 
I invite you now to determine which of the segments 
in each pair below is marked (less natural). State your 
reasons. 
[6.1] A 
B 
u

6 
o

In each case the sound in column A is marked. Vowels 
are normally voiced like [u] and not voiceless like [u]; 
vowels are normally oral like [o] and not nasal like [6]; front 
vowels are normally unrounded like [e] and not rounded 
like [oe]. 
Languages typically have both natural segments and 
natural phoneme inventories. In Chapter 2 we noted that 
phoneme inventories tend to be SYMMETRICAL. That 
observation can be restated in terms of naturalness. As a 

100 Naturalness and strength 
rule, creating symmetrical phoneme inventories entails 
maximising the use of a few phonological parameters. Such 
an arrangement is economical and has the merit of reducing 
the burden on memory during language acquisition: a small 
number of features is learned and is reused many times. 
This is preferable to having phonemes which have little in 
common with each other and which entail mastering 
numerous distinctive features. 
Contrast the inventories in [6.2] with those in [6.3]:

A phoneme inventory like that in [6.3b], with its many 
holes in the pattern, is less likely to be attested in natural 
languages than 
the symmetrical Turkana inventory 
in 
[6.2b], which distinguishes voiced stops, voiceless stops and 
nasals at each one of the three places of articulation 
exploited. Likewise, the balanced Swahili system in [6.2a] 
where front vowels are paired with back ones is a more 
likely vowel inventory than the skewed one containing only 
front vowels which is shown in [6.3a]. 
While recognising the importance of symmetry, we 
need to constantly bear in mind the fact that it is not an 
absolute 
imperative.

Natural segments, natural classes and natural processes 101

for instance, contains no bilabial voiceless stop:

We shall end this section by re-examining data first 
introduced in the last chapter, which are reproduced below 
as [6.5] for convenience. These data illustrate the role of 
NATURAL CLASSES in the phonology of Luganda:

I give 
n-daga 
I show 
n-sika

rj-kuba 
I hit 
The segments [m n ji rj] which acquire the place of 
articulation of the following consonant are not a random 
collection of segments; rather, they are a coherent class of 
phonetically similar sounds. They form a natural class. The 
homorganic nasal assimilation rule affects only the natural 
class consisting of nasal consonants. 
The other phonological processes discussed in Chapter 
5 also affect natural classes. The segments which condition 
or undergo a phonological process do share in each instance 
some phonetic characteristic. Thus, typically, palatalisation 
of velar consonants occurs in the context of front vowels 
(especially high ones like [i]) which are themselves produced 
with the tongue approximating the hard palate. Labialis-
ation occurs in the neighbourhood of labial vowels like [u] 
which are themselves produced with rounded lips. Nasal-
isation of vowels occurs when they are adjacent to nasal 
consonants. Voiceless consonants may acquire some voicing 
when juxtaposed with inherently voiced segments like 
vowels or sonorants (such as nasals), and so on. 
Important though they are, naturalness and markedness 
are not absolute concepts. Rather, they are both relative. 
What is marked on unmarked will often depend on the 
circumstances. A nonlinguistic analogy should help to 
clarify this: wearing a bikini or a kilt and sporran are in a 

102 Naturalness and strength 
sense marked modes of dress. Most people most of the time 
do not go about their business so attired. However, a 
woman in a bikini on the beach on a hot, sunny day or a 
Scotsman in a kilt at a Burns Supper would respectively be 
very 'unmarked'. So it is in phonology. Nasal vowels, to 
take one example, are marked. Indeed, we would be 
extremely surprised if we found a language which had only 
nasal vowels and no oral ones. However, between two nasal 
consonants, or before a nasal plus consonant cluster like 
[nd], nasalised vowels would be unmarked. It would be 
somewhat unusual for vowels occurring in those contexts 
to have no nasalisation. Using an oral [ae] in [maen] is 
marked but using a nasalised [ae] and saying [mien] is 
unmarked. The same would apply to palatalisation of velars 
before high front vowels or labialisation before rounded 
vowels. Markedness cannot be interpreted with total disre-
gard for context. 
For the next example look back at the discussion of 
voice assimilation in English in section 5.2 of the last 
chapter. The consonants in the suffixes -s, -z, -iz; -t, -d, 
-id that figure in English voice assimilation are either frica-
tives or stops. This is not accidental. In many languages 
fricatives and stops (together with affricates) form a natu-
ral class to which the label OBSTRUENT (or NON-
SONORANT) is given. These sounds share the phonetic 
characteristics of having very significant obstruction in the 
oral tract and of being typically voiceless. They also tend 
to display similar phonological behaviour.

Say the words in [6.6] aloud again and again. Compare the 
voicing of the words on the same line carefully and see if 
there is some kind of pattern. 

Natural segments, natural classes and natural processes 103 
What you will discover is that in English obstruents are 
more heavily voiced at the beginning of a word than they 
are word-finally. Generally word final voicing is so atten-
uated that it is barely detectable. In fact, the distinction 
between 'voiced' and 'voiceless' obstruents word-finally is 
less important in discriminating between words than the 
lengthening of the vowel that precedes a 'voiced' consonant. 
It is natural for obstruents to be voiceless. Many 
languages have more voiceless obstruents than voiced ones 
and some have no voiced obstruent phonemes at all. That 
is the situation in many Australian languages. 
And 
numerous languages, with voiced obstruents, have a rule 
which devoices them in syllable final position. Such an 
obstruent devoicing rule can be seen at work in Turkish:

6.2.1 Phonological strength hierarchies 
In the last chapter we saw that assimilation and dissimilation 
are useful concepts for elucidating phonological alternation. 
Many natural phonological processes involve some kind of 
assimilation or less commonly, dissimilation. But assimi-
lation and dissimilation are not the only concepts in terms 
of which naturalness can be discussed. 
Many phonological processes can be fruitfully exam-
ined using the notions of STRENGTHENING (also called 
FORTITION) and WEAKENING 
(also called LENI-
TION). These two concepts are not independent of each 
other. They are merely two poles of the same gradient. As 
in everyday life, strength and weakness are relative. In [6.8] 

104 Naturalness and strength 
I have reproduced a commonly accepted phonological 
strength hierarchy (> indicates a step towards a 'weaker' 
pronunciation): 
[6.8] (a) VOICELESS > VOICED 
(b) STOP > AFFRICATE > FRICATIVE > 
APPROXIMANT > ZERO 
Before you proceed, I suggest that you work out the 
phonetic parameter(s) on which this hierarchy is based. Is 
it place of articulation, manner of articulation, airstream 
mechanism, phonation or something else? Now use your 
answer to rank the following sounds on the hierarchy which 
you have established. In some cases you might need to have 
more than one sound occupying the same place: 
[6.9] t 
r 
o 
P 
z 
s 
k 
d 
g
m
w
3
8
p
b
a 
In [6.8a] SONORITY is the parameter in question. As 
a first approximation, sonority is related to voicing. The 
greater the propensity a sound has of spontaneous voicing, 
the more sonority it has: 
[6.10] Sonority hierarchy 
least sonority 
1 voiceless obstruents (e.g. t s k) 
2 voiced obstruents (e.g. d g P z) 
3 
nasals (e.g. m) 
4 
liquids (e.g. r) 
5 
glides (e.g. w) 
6 ,, 
vowels (e.g. a 0) 
greatest sonority 
The sonority hierarchy is an inverse restatement of the 
strength hierarchy (see also [9.6] page 158 below). In view 
of this, some phonologists question the need to distinguish 
between the strength hierarchy and the sonority hierarchy. 
Under the heading of strength they would prefer to include 
not only stricture (i.e. obstruction of the airstream) but also 
sonority. 
Grouping together stricture and sonority under the 
rubric of the strength hierarchy might strike you as odd. 

Natural segments, natural classes and natural processes 105 
On the face of it, the two phenomena appear unrelated. 
However closer examination reveals an interesting relation-
ship, especially where language evolution is concerned. To 
understand this relationship we need to draw a distinction 
between SYNCHRONIC and DIACHRONIC approaches 
to the study of language. Synchronic linguistics studies the 
state of a language during one period in its history. A 
grammar of mid-twentieth century English is a synchronic 
description. Diachronic (or historical) linguistics on the 
other hand, studies the evolution of a language during 
successive periods. 
Frequently, both synchronically and diachronically, 
voiceless consonants change into voiced ones in environ-
ments similar to those where the reduction in the strength 
of the obstruction in the production of consonants takes 
place. Indeed, one process may facilitate the other. It is 
significant that the sounds at the weak end of the strength 
hierarchy are typically voiced, while those at the strong end 
are normally voiceless. Voiced sounds are weaker than their 
voiceless counterparts - [d] is weaker than [t], [z] is weaker 
than [s] and so on. When a voiceless sound like [t] becomes 
voiced, we can speak of 'weakening'. 
If you are in any doubt as to what the answer to [6.8b] 
ought to be, turn back to the first chapter and work out the 
manner of articulation of each sound. The strength hier-
archy in [6.8b] is based on manner of articulation i.e. the 
way and the extent to which the airstream is obstructed in 
the articulation of a particular sound. Stops involve the 
strongest obstruction and approximants the weakest, with 
the remaining types of sound falling in between. Of course, 
having no obstruction at all and dropping a sound alto-
gether is the ultimate form of weakening. 
Many 
phonological 
concepts 
like 
assimilation, 
strengthening, etc., refer to processes that can be under-
stood from either a synchronic or diachronic point of view 
(see Chapter 8). Strengthening and weakening are exempli-
fied below using some data from historical phonology. 
Compare the forms in [6. n ] (Hooper 1976): 
[6.11] (a) Latin

Spanish 
French

The changes exemplified involve movement down the 
sonority hierarchy. 
In some cases, before being deleted a voiced stop may 
go through a fricative phase. The word meaning 'loyal' in 
modern Spanish is derived from Latin legale whose [g] 
weakened to the velar fricative [y] in Medieval Spanish 
when it was pronounced as leyale. The velar fricative was 
eventually lost, resulting in the modern Spanish form leal. 
In this case the progression down the sonority hierarchy is 
from a voiced stop to a voiced fricative before deletion takes 
place. 
The examples presented so far have been of weakening. 
But sounds can move up the strength hierarchy. In Luganda 
[l], an approximant, becomes a stop [d] when it is immedi-
ately preceded by a nasal stop: 
[6.12] [laga] 
'show' 
[ndaga] 
'I show' 
[kaliga] 
'lamb' 
[ndiga] 
'sheep' 
Some linguists have added PLACE OF ARTICU-
LATION as a parameter of the universal strength hierarchy: 
[6.13] LABIAL > ALVEOLAR > VELAR 
This dimension of the hierarchy seems to be valid for the 
languages of Western Europe, like Danish, where in inter-
vocalic position, velar / g / undergoes the most extreme 
form of lenition (i.e. weakening), being deleted altogether; 
alveolar /d/ is moderately weakened, being changed to the 
fricative [3] but labial /b/ remains unchanged. 
However, the universal validity of a place of articu-
lation hierarchy is doubtful. In many Bantu languages, for 
instance, it is the labial place of articulation that is weakest. 
Many languages in this family historically weakened and 
completely dropped the labial stops /p/ or /b/ while 
retaining the alveolar and velar ones. Thus in Kikamba 
(Kenya) the reflex of the Proto-Bantu noun class prefix *ba-
is a-. The labial [b] was deleted except where it was 
preceded by a nasal. After a nasal it survives as prenasalised 

Natural segments, natural classes and natural processes 107 
[mb]. Proto-Bantu /p/ is equally prone to lenition *p—»h in 
Sukuma (Tanzania), Rundi (Burundi), Pare (Tanzania) etc.; 
*p > ({> in Pokomo (Kenya), and Rimi (Tanzania) etc. 
Typically velars and alveolars do not undergo lenition to the 
extent that labials do. Given this evidence, it would be 
unwise to insist on the universality of a strength hierarchy 
based on place of articulation. 
It is arguable that the sonority and manner of articu-
lation strength hierarchies in [6.8] should be replaced by the 
single hierarchy shown in [6.14]. This, for the reasons given 
above excludes the dimension of place of articulation. 
[6.14] VOICELESS STOP > VOICED STOP 
> 
VOICELESS 
AFFRICATE 
> 
VOICED 
AFFRICATE > VOICELESS CONTINUANT 
> VOICED CONTINUANT > NASAL > 
APPROXIMANT 
One type of consonant not included in [6.14] which 
there is strong evidence for is the GEMINATE consonant 
like [t:] or [d:], usually represented by doubling consonant 
letters ([tt] or [dd]). Gemination occurs when two identical 
consonants are adjacent to each other in the same syllable 
as in English penknife [pen:aif]; in other words, gemination 
occurs when a particular segmental articulation is prolonged 
to cover what would otherwise be two distinct segments. 
Geminate consonants occupy the highest rung of the 
hierarchy. 
The strength hierarchy, re-stated now in [6.15], is 
manifested in synchronic phonological alternation and in 
historical sound change in numerous languages: 
[6.15] GEMINATE VOICELESS STOP > GEMI-
NATE 
VOICED 
STOP 
> 
VOICELESS 
STOP > VOICED STOP > 
VOICELESS 
FRICATIVE > VOICED FRICATIVE . . . . 
The relative strength remains the same with other manners 
of articulation. 
Synchronically, in many languages in positions of 
weakening, 
for 
instance between 
vowels, 
geminate 
segments like [t:] (spelled with tt in the examples which 
follow) alternate with plain segments like [t]. Thus in 
Luganda the singular of the word 'branch' is ttabi [t:aBi] but 

108 Naturalness and strength 
the plural is matabi [mataBi]. An historical example of the 
same kind is provided by the word for 'drop' in Romance 
languages where the reflexes of Latin gutta are gota in 
Spanish and goutte in French. The original geminate has 
changed to [t] in both languages. 
6.3 Explanations of naturalness 
The assimilatory phonological processes of the kind which 
we explored in the last chapter all have a firm basis in 
articulatory phonetics. We can point to a good articulatory 
reason for a process like palatalisation, labialisation or nasal-
isation. Where possible, adjacent sounds are made similar 
to each other so that one avoids using any more effort than 
is required to ensure that one is understood by the 
addressee. But while assimilation makes the task of speech 
production easier, it can make speech perception more 
difficult. It is easier to discriminate between sounds if they 
are very different from each other than it is to distinguish 
them when they are very alike. To counterbalance assimi-
lation, there are natural processes which have the effect of 
enhancing differences between sounds. These facilitate the 
task of the hearer. In Chapter 5, voice dissimilation in 
Kirundi was introduced as an example of dissimilation. 
When this rule applies, the prefix and the root end up not 
having the same value for voicing, which makes them more 
different from each other than they would otherwise be. 
Vowel patterns also frequently obey the principle of 
MAXIMUM PERCEPTUAL DIFFERENTIATION. The 
set in [6.16] turns up in language after language with a three 
vowel system (see section 3 of Chapter 2). 
[6.16] 
front 
back

The choice of these vowels is not accidental. These 
three vowels occupy the most peripheral positions in vowel 
space: [i] is the highest front vowel, [u] is the highest back 
vowel and [a] is the lowest vowel. Perceptually they are 
maximally distinct. If a language has only three vowels, in 
order to avoid hearers getting them confused (and as a 
consequence getting the meanings of words in which they 
occur confused), it is almost invariably the three vowels [i 
a u] that are selected. Languages as diverse as Greenlandic 
Eskimo and Australian Pitta-Pitta have /i a u/ as their only 
vowel phonemes. 
Languages 
with 
a five 
vowel 
phoneme 
system 
consisting of/i e a o u/, if they have rules which neutralise 
vowel distinctions in certain environments, tend to maintain 
the opposition between /i a u/ in the places of neutralis-
ation. An example should clarify this. In many Bantu 
languages with the five vowel phonemes /i e a o u/, only 
the peripheral vowels /i a u/ occur in noun class prefixes 
which mark the class (or gender) of a noun, as you can see 
in the Luganda forms below:

6.3.1 Natural phonology 
Pholonogists do not agree on the place of naturalness in 
phonological theory. Those who belong to a school called 
NATURAL PHONOLOGY which was pioneered by 
Stampe (1973) argue that the phonological component of 
language is not merely the result of CONVENTION, 
rather it is the way it is for very good reasons. It reflects, 
on the one hand, the auditory, articulatory and speech 
processing capacity of humans, and on the other hand the 
functions which language serves. They maintain that in all 
languages, phonemes and phonological processes are the 
residue of UNIVERSAL PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES. 
Typically these are assimilation processes like homorganic 
nasal assimilation, patalisation, nasalisation, voice assimi-

110 Naturalness and strength 
lation, and so on. It is claimed that in acquiring the phono-
logical system of its language, a child has to learn to 
SUPPRESS in different ways and to different language-
specific 
degrees 
various 
innate 
universal 
phonological 
processes. A rump of those processes survives, tailored to 
fit whatever quirks a particular language may have acquired 
over the centuries. It is suggested that the striking similarity 
that exists between the phonological processes found in 
unrelated languages can be largely explained in terms of 
their having preserved the same or similar aspects of 
universal natural processes. 
In this approach, a sharp distinction is drawn between 
rules and processes. The term RULE is used to refer to 
phonetically wholly or partially unmotivated alternations, 
like those exemplified in the next paragraph, which are 
governed by the conventions of a particular language. 
PROCESSES 
are alternations 
which 
are regulated 
by 
universal phonetic or functional factors. Unlike processes, 
rules are idiosyncratic properties of particular languages and 
do not form part of humankind's common phonological 
inheritance. Natural processes are more common than idio-
syncratic rules. Donegan and Stampe (1979:127) claim that 
natural phonology 'follows naturally from the nature of 
things' because essentially phonological patterning is not 
merely a matter of convention. 
Nonetheless, even the most ardent natural phonologist 
would admit that not everything in synchronic phonology 
is natural. The alternation in the shape of some morphemes 
either has a tenuous phonetic basis or is entirely arbitrary: 
there are numerous U N N A T U R A L alternations which are 
motivated by lexical or grammatical considerations rather 
than phonetic factors. For instance, in English the plural of 
a noun is normally formed by suffixing an alveolar fricative 
which agrees in voicing with the last segment of the noun 
root. But in a few irregular forms like ox, which becomes 
oxen instead of the expected *oxes in the plural, or sheep, 
which remains sheep in the plural instead of the expected 
*sheeps, the regular natural process of assimilation does not 
apply. 
A case has been made in the literature for restricting 
phonology to processes with a genuine phonetic basis and 
reserving for the morphological component of the grammar 

Explanations of naturalness 111 
any rules regulating alternations that are determined by 
nonphonetic factors. This dichotomy between processes and 
rules is justified on the grounds that natural processes are 
easier to master in language acquisition than rules, which 
are not natural. Furthermore, when the language faculty 
disintegrates in aphasia, control of idiosyncratic rules, 
vanishes before control of natural processes. The theory 
predicts, for example, that an English-speaking aphasiac is 
more likely to continue correctly forming regular plurals 
like ships and boxes which obey the natural process of voice 
assimilation than irregular plurals like sheep and oxen which 
obey an ad hoc rule. 
But there are complications. There is not always a 
simple dichotomy between natural processes and unnatural 
rules. With the passage of time, natural processes may have 
severe constraints imposed on their application without 
their natural basis becoming entirely lost. Re-examine the 
treatment of place of articulation in the last chapter. In 
section 5.3.4 we considered the process of place of articu-
lation assimilation in English and in various African 
languages. You will recall from section 5.2.1 that in a 
language like Luganda all nasals always take the place of 
articulation of the following consonant, this being the 
universal natural process. In English too, this principle does 
apply, albeit in a very restricted way, as we saw in the 
examples in [5.16]. It automatically affects the prefix hi- but 
not the prefix un-. In Luganda the universal natural process 
of homorganic assimilation is preserved intact but in 
English it is inhibited, though not completely suppressed. 
It applies not across the board, but rather in restricted, 
morphologically defined environments. But this is still less 
arbitrary than the rule which says add nothing to form the 
plural of sheep. 
Continue exploring the notion of 'degrees of natural-
ness' by examining some more data, this time taken from 
Swahili.

State the circumstances in which nasals are: 
(a) homorganic 
(b) syllabic 
Be warned! You will need to take into account some of the 
information provided about MORPHOLOGY. Information 
about noun class membership is important as different 
morphemes may behave in different ways in identical 
phonetic contexts. 
I hope you have been able to see that in Swahili, a 
word-medial nasal or a nasal prefix marking classes 9/10 
must be homorganic with the following consonant but that 
a nasal prefix marking class 1 or 3 need not be homorganic. 
While assimilation of a nasal to the place of articulation of 
the following consonant is itself a natural process, its 
implementation in Swahili is sensitive to nonphonetic 
factors - it depends on the noun class which the nasal 
represents. The homorganic nasal assimilation rule is 
MORPHOLOGISED. It is not automatically triggered by 
phonetic information. It requires morphological information. 
Likewise, the distribution 
of syllabic nasals, is 
morphologised. Any class 1 or class 3 nasal prefix is syllabic 
but a class 9/10 prefix is syllabic only if the root to which 
it is attached is monosyllabic. The distinction between 
monosyllabic and longer roots is clearly phonological but 
information 
concerning 
noun 
class membership 
is 
morphological. 
Rule morphologisation represents a cline rather than a 
dichotomy. Some rules may be more morphologised than 
others; the extent to which the natural basis of a phono-
logical alternation is subverted by nonphonetic factors varies 
greatly. 
Besides morphologisation, another common cause of 

Explanations of naturalness 113 
the loss of naturalness is TELESCOPING. 
Telescoping 
occurs when some intermediate stages in a series of natural 
historical changes get eclipsed or completely lost, leaving 
behind a phonetically bizarre set of synchronic alternations. 
Normally alternants of the same morpheme are related by 
phonological processes that are plausible. 
Occasionally, 
however, we find phonetically triggered, automatic alter-
nations which are arbitrary from a synchronic point of 
view. 
In Luganda, for instance, we find / p / alternating some-
times with |j] and sometimes with [w], which is extraor-
dinary. It is very odd for a bilabial voiceless stop to have 
palatal and labio-velar approximants as its allophones. Allo-
phones of the same phoneme ought to be phonetically 
similar; these sounds have very little in common. 
Study the data in [6.19] and state the distribution of the 
allophones o f / p / .

to call 
kuweta to bend 
wa give! (imp.) tujita 
we call tuweta 
we bend 
mpa I give 
mpita 
I call 
mpeta 
I bend 
The fact that [p j w] are in complementary distribution 
is strange. But we can easily write a rule stating their 
distribution: 
/ p / becomes 
(i) 
[j] when followed 
by [i] and not 
preceded by a nasal; 
(ii) 
[w] when 
followed 
by any 
other 
vowel provided it is not preceded by 
a nasal; 
(iii) 
where it is preceded by a nasal, it is 
realised as [p] regardless of the vowel 
that follows it. 
When Luganda is compared with another very closely 
related Ugandan language, Runyankole, the missing stages 
in Luganda can be reconstructed thus: 
[6.20] p > 
ph > 
h > 
y or w (depending on the 
following vowel) 

114 Naturalness and strength 
Evidence for [6.20] is contained in sound correspondences 
in forms like:

Natural phonology opens new perspectives on the 
problems of phonological analysis. However, there remain 
some nagging doubts. The explanation of phonological 
alternation which it offers is essentially FUNCTIONAL, 
emphasising as it does natural assimilation processes, and 
implicitly ease of articulation. But a functional account in 
terms of ease of articulation which worjks well for speech 
production will not be as satisfactory when the focus shifts 
to speech perception, since what makes the articulation of 
sounds easier tends to make their discrimination 
more 
difficult. The two viewpoints are in conflict. In concrete 
terms, what this means is that we cannot always explain 
why in a given case assimilation rather than dissimilation 
is the preferred solution. The explanation proferred by a 
natural phonologist might appear to a sceptical observer to 
be a somewhat arbitrary, post hoc rationalisation 
whose 
explanatory value is doubtful. 
Consider the claim, for instance, that the ideal syllable 
type is CV, i.e. the kind of syllable that ends in a vowel 
(see section 9.5, page 175). It is said that the function of 
many rules is to maximise preferred CV syllables. It is 
sometimes suggested that this explains why, 
in 
many 
languages, a word final consonant not followed by a vowel 
is deleted. For example, in French, the final [t] is dropped 
in words like petit [pari] 'little' (masculine); in the feminine 
where it is followed by [a] as in petite [patita] 'little' the 
consonant is kept. Similarly, the desire to maintain the 
preferred CV syllabic type is said to explain the insertion 
of extra vowels in English loanwords like hospital when they 
are borrowed by languages that require consonants to be 
followed by vowels. Thus hospital is often rendered as 
hosipital[ in Swahili and many African languages. 
At present there is no way of determining 
which 
natural process takes precedence where alternative natural 

Explanations of naturalness 115 
processes are available. Even if it turned out to be true that 
naturalness determines rule application, we would be none 
the wiser when it comes to providing an explanatory 
account of a specific phonological event. It is not yet poss-
ible to explain why, to create a CV sequence, in one 
instance a vowel is added and in another a consonant is 
deleted. Intuitively naturalness seems to be a valid concept. 
However, its predictive value and hence its place in a 
rigorous theory of phonology is still uncertain.

CHAPTER 7 
Interaction between rules 
7.1 Introduction to rule formalisation and ordering 
Previous chapters have shown the need for more than one 
level of phonological representation. If we assume that there 
are underlying representations from which surface (phonetic) 
representations are derived, we shall often need more than 
one rule to map underlying representations on to surface 
representations. The situation can be compared to rush hour 
city traffic at a road junction, with rules queueing up to be 
applied. Police officers or traffic lights are needed to regu-
late the flow of traffic. Likewise, in phonology a mechanism 
is needed to determine which one of several rules affecting 
a piece of data has precedence over other rules. Obviously, 
where rules do not interfere with each other, where they 
are like traffic on parallel one way streets, the question of 
regulation does not arise. I illustrate this with English 
examples in [7.1]: 
[7.1] [phit] 
pit 
[pwhul] 
pool 
[thik] 
tick 
[twhuk] 
took 
[k^l] 
keel 
[kwhul] 
cool 
[atVnd] 
attend 
[3kwhustik] 
acoustic 
The rules we needed to account for [7.1] are listed infor-
mally in [7.2] 
[7.2] (a) voiceless stops are aspirated at the beginning 
of a stressed syllable; 
(b) consonants are labialised (rounded) before 
rounded vowels; 
(c) velar consonants are fronted 
(palatalised) 
before high front vowels. 

118 Interaction between rules 
Rules [7.2b] and [7.2c] do not affect each other. There is 
no interaction problem since they do not have the same 
structural description, i.e. the phonetic properties of their 
inputs are different. Rule [7.2b] requires the presence of a 
rounded vowel, and all such vowels are back in English 
while rule [7.2c] stipulates that there must be a high front 
vowel. The two rules are like traffic on different highways. 
There is no possibility of their interfering with each other. 
Determine whether rule [7.2a] interferes with either of 
the other two rules. 
The answer must be 'no' since the voiceless stop at the 
beginning of a stressed syllable is aspirated regardless of the 
vowel that follows. Here again no traffic control system is 
needed. It would make no difference to the final output 
whatsoever which order the rules were applied in. Regu-
lation of rule interaction is required only if one rule affects 
in some way the potential input to another rule. 
Before we examine more closely the problem of rule 
interaction, I shall introduce you to the basic formal 
conventions 
used 
by 
generative phonologists 
because 
normally rules are written using distinctive features and 
formal notation. The motivation for rule formalisation is 
that it increases the explicitness of linguistic descriptions and 
makes it easier to expose woolly or incoherent analyses. I 
shall introduce the basic formal conventions of GENER-
ATIVE PHONOLOGY, by restating formally in [7.3] the 
rules outlined above in [7.2]:

A formal rule consists of the following: 
(a) the input, which states the sound or sounds affected 
by the rule; 
(b) the arrow, which means 're-write as' or 'is realised as' 
or 
'becomes' 
(but 
no 
historical 
development 
is 
implied); 
(c) what occurs to the right of the arrow is the output of 
the rule; 
(d) following the output, there is a diagonal line '/' to the 
right of that line is the environment, the 
line 
which forms part of the environment shows precisely 
where the changed segment is located; 
(e) brackets round an element (like (C) in [7.3a]) indicate 
that a given element is optional - the rule applies 
regardless of the presence or absence of any optional 
element. In this instance it indicates that a voiceless 
plosive is still aspirated even where a consonant inter-
venes, as in prayer. 
We shall turn to French for our next example of rule 
interaction and rule formalisation. 
Usually in French, an underlying word final consonant 
is deleted unless it is followed by a vowel. This produces 
alternations like [triko] (le) tricot 'knitted wear' and [trikotc] 
tricoter 'to knit'. A good place to look for examples of this 
is the alternation between the masculine and feminine form 
of nouns and adjectives: 
[7.4] FINAL C O N S O N A N T DELETION 
Masculine 
/bos/ [ba] 
//at/ 
[Ja] 
//od/ 
[Jo] 
bas 
chat 
chaud 
Feminine 
/bass/ [bas] 
/Jaw/ 
[Jat] 
/Joda/ [Jod] 
basse 
chatte 
chaude 
'low' 
'cat' 
'hot' 
In the underlying representation the feminine 
form 
ends in [a]. Phonetically, however, that final vowel is 
normally deleted in contemporary French — it is the so-

120 Interaction between rules 
called 'silent e. In fact, this vowel has not always been 
'silent'. It was weakly pronounced as [a] in Old French. 
Even today, when French poetry is recited, 'silent e' is scru-
pulously pronounced as [a] in certain contexts. The rules 
regulating the pronunciation or omission of [a] are complex. 
Their main function is to determine whether [a] contributes 
to the syllable count. See Grammont (1961). The rule of 
final consonant deletion which applies to underlying repre-
sentation can be formalised as [7.5]: 
[7.5] [ + cons] 
*- 0/ 
Remarks on the notation: 
(i) 0 means zero i.e. the segment is rewritten as zero - in 
other words it is deleted, 
(ii) # = word boundary 
(iii) the curly brackets { 
} indicate alternatives; here deletion 
of a consonant occurs either before a consonant or 
before a boundary at the end of a word. 
Next consider VOWEL NASALISATION, 
another 
phonological process which occurs in French: 
[7.6] [fe] 
[da] 
[robe] 
[fe] 
[sa] 
[5] 
[5] 
[ta] 
[mule]

'lawyer (pejorative)' 
'hunger' 
'without 
idef. pron. 'one' 
'in' 
'so much' 
'mill' 
The rule to account for [7.6] is given in [7.7]. 
C 
[7.7] V 
»-[+nasal]/ 
[+nasal] 
Strictly speaking distinctive features should always be 
used in the formal statement of rules. But in practice, for 
convenience, instead of using distinctive features, we often 
adopt the convention of using V to represent any vowel, 
C to represent any consonant, G to represent any glide and 
N to represent any nasal. 
Rule [7.7] states that a vowel is nasalised if it is 
followed by a nasal consonant which in turn is followed by 
C

either another consonant or a word boundary in the under-
lying representation. 
If you turn now to [7.8], you will see that rule [7.7] 
does not apply to the vowels in [7.8b] because in the 
underlying representation, none of them is followed by 
cither a nasal consonant which is in turn followed by 
another consonant or appears in word final position. But 
nasalisation does apply to the vowels in [7.8a] because their 
underlying representations satisfy the requirements of the 
nasalisation rule. (We shall use the abbreviations UR and PR

122 Interaction between rules 
Before moving on, list separately words in [7.8a] which 
have nasalised vowels: 
(a) due to being followed by a nasal in word final position: 
(b) due to being immediately followed by a nasal which is 
in turn followed by another consonant. 
The words bon and Jin are obvious examples of the effects 
of rule (a) and Jondamental of rule (b). 
7.2 Linear rule ordering 
The French data in [7.8] pose a rule ordering problem. A 
word like an [a] is subject both to the rule that deletes final 
consonants which are not immediately followed by a vowel 
and also to the nasalisation rule. To determine the order in 
which the two rules should be applied, we can try out the 
two derivations in [7.9] and [7.10] and see which one yields 
the correct output. 
[7.9] Underlying representation /an/ 
First apply 
Rule [7.5]: Final consonant deletion 
[+cons] 
*- 0 / 
JC 
1*1 
(This deletes the /n/ of an as it is word-final.) 
Then apply 
Rule [7.7]: Vowel nasalisation 
[-cons] 
^[+nasal] / 
[+nasal] | ^ 
The nasalisation rule fails to apply because 
the nasal which triggers off the nasalisation 
process is absent, having been deleted by 
[7.5]. Consequently the final output is *[a]. 
This is obviously incorrect. 
Let us now try applying the two rules in reverse order, 
assuming again that the underlying representation is /an/. 
[7.10] First apply 
Rule [7.7]: Vowel nasalisation 
[-cons] 
*- [+nasal] / 
[+nasal] 
C I 

Linear rule ordering 123 
This yields [an] (and a lowering rule 
affecting 
nasalised 
vowels subsequently 
turns it into /an/).

By this rule /an/ loses its final /n/ and becomes 
[6], which is the correct phonetic form. 
This example shows that there are situations where 
the order in which rules apply makes a difference. That 
being the case, principles regulating the order in which rules 
apply are needed. 
In SPE Chomsky and Halle proposed that rules should 
be LINEARLY ORDERED. To illustrate this, suppose in 
the phonological component of the grammar of a given 
language there are thirty rules. By this principle, the rules 
would be arranged in a list and it would be stipulated that 
each rule applies after all the rules that precede it and before 
all the rules that follow it on the list. It would not be poss-
ible, for instance, to apply rule two after rule ten, where 
both rules are applicable. Once a particular order has been 
established, it is strictly observed in every derivation in a 
language. Furthermore, a rule can only apply once in a 
derivation. This means that a rule cannot re-apply in the 
same derivation either to its own output or to the output 
of another rule ordered after it which satisfies its structural 
description. 
If the application of one rule has absolutely no effect 
on the potential input to another rule, the question of the 
sequence of application of those rules simply need not be 
raised. This was established at the beginning of the first 
section of this chapter. However, the question of linear 
ordering arises in a very interesting way where one rule can 
affect another, as in the French data above. We shall explore 
this again by examining some data from Luganda.

Luganda has another rule which is of interest in this 
context. It is an optional rule which deletes a root-initial 
/ j / which is preceded by certain CV prefixes. The effect of 
that rule is shown in [7.13].

Linear rule ordering 125 
The / j / deletion rule, can be written as [7.15]:

These Luganda examples show that in order to derive 
the correct output in [7.13] for words like [twe:la] 'we 
sweep', it is necessary to apply the / j / deletion rule in 
[7.15] before the glide formation rule in [7.12]. 
Work out the reason for this before you read on. 
If we assume that rules apply linearly, until [7.15] 
/u/. 
has 
been applied to a form like /tu+jela/, the vowels /u/ and 
/e/ are separated by / j / and the input to glide formation is 
not available and so glide formation cannot be applied. For 
glide formation to apply, a high vowel must be adjacent to 
another vowel. The deletion of/j/ creates the input to glide 
formation. The implications for rule ordering are obvious: 
/ j / deletion must precede glide formation if both rules are 
to apply. Technically, this kind of rule relationship where 
one rule opens the door to the application of another rule 
is called FEEDING ORDER. 
The reverse is also possible. One rule may prevent or 
pre-empt the application of another. In that case the rules 
are said to be arranged in a BLEEDING ORDER. We shall 
explore this type of rule interaction using data from Swahili. 
Swahili has a rule of homorganic nasal assimilation. 
Here it is illustrated applying to forms in noun class 9. This 
class contains many nouns referring to non-humans:

The nasal prefix / N / undergoes homorganic nasal assi-
milation. If a noun root begins with a voiced consonant, 
the nasal class prefix adjusts to its place of articulation so 
that it is labial, or alveolar or velar depending on whether 

126 Interaction between rules 
the first consonant of the noun root is labial, alveolar or 
velar (see section 5.3.4). 
To write this rule formally we need to use Greek letter 
variables like a (alpha), P (beta) and y (gamma) which range 
over both plus and minus values of a given feature. Thus, 
N 
C 
[aant] [aant] means that the nasal and the consonant after 
N 
C 
it are either both [+ant] or both [—ant]; [P back] [P back] 
means that the nasal and the consonant after it are either 
both [+back] or both [—back] etc. Building on that, we can 
account for [7.16] using this formal homorganic nasal 
assimilation rule: 
[7-I7] 
N 
[+nas] 
"a ant " 
P cor 
_Y back_ 
/ -
"a ant 
P cor 
.Y back_ 
Where, however, the noun root begins with a voiceless 
stop, the assimilation rule in [7.17] is blocked. In that case, 
the stop following the nasal is aspirated and the nasal itself 
is dropped, as you can see:

The nasal deletion rule, it turns out, applies not only 
where a nasal is followed by a voiceless stop, but also where 
any other obstruent (that is, a fricative or affricate or stop) 
follows a nasal:

If we turn our attention to rule interaction, we observe 
that the nasal deletion rule BLEEDS the homorganic nasal 
assimilation rule. Having been deleted by [7.20], the nasal 
is no longer available to the assimilation rule in [7.17]. 
Now work out how nasal deletion [7.20] interacts with 
aspiration [7.19]. 
Since it is the presence of a class 9 nasal prefix which 
triggers off aspiration, the aspiration rule in [7.19] must 
precede nasal deletion [7.20], if we assume that these rules 
apply in a linear order. Having conditioned the aspiration, 
the nasal can be subsequently deleted. If the order were 
reversed, and [7.20] applied first, deleting the nasal, the 
input to [719] would be destroyed and the correct surface 
form would not be derived. The upshot is that given two 
obligatory rules, one of which can 
POTENTIALLY 
BLEED the other, they must be ordered in a manner that 
ensures that bleeding is avoided. 
Now return to the French consonant deletion and 
vowel nasalisation examples above and see how these rules 
affect each other. You will recall that in order to get the 
right output, it is important that vowel nasalisation precedes 
consonant deletion; if the order is reversed, vowel nasalis-
ation is blocked because the deletion of the consonant robs 
nasalisation of its input. 
When two rules interact in such a way that one of them 
would be blocked if their order were reversed, those rules 
are said to be in a COUNTER-BLEEDING relationship. 
The French rules [7.5] and [7.7] are in a counter-bleeding 
relationship: unless vowel nasalisation precedes consonant 
deletion the derivation aborts because nasal deletion would 
destroy the input to vowel nasalisation. There are a number 
of other rule relationships which we need not go into in an 
introductory book of this kind. 

128 Interaction between rules 
7.3 Abandoning extrinsic ordering 
The linear ordering hypothesis is presented above without 
considering any possible alternatives. It is assumed that 
phonological rules must be ordered so as to ensure that their 
interaction is correctly handled. For instance, where one 
rule would destroy the input to another (i.e. where rules are 
in a BLEEDING RELATIONSHIP) or where the prior 
application of one rule opens up the possibility of applying 
another (i.e. where rules are in a FEEDING RELATION-
SHIP) it is claimed that the linguist needs to order the rules 
in the appropriate linear sequence. In fact, 
this linear 
ordering position is controversial. 
Before we see why the above ordering hypothesis is 
controversial we need to clarify two important concepts. 
We shall do that by distinguishing between two kinds of 
ordering relationships: INTRINSIC and EXTRINSIC linear 
ordering. Rules are said to be extrinsically ordered if their 
interaction is governed by tailor-made ordering statements 
designed for that specific set of rules in a particular 
language. But rules are intrinsically ordered if the order 
in which they apply follows automatically from the way in 
which they are formulated. For instance, as we saw above, 
if two obligatory rules are in a feeding relationship, for both 
of them to apply the feeding rule must necessarily apply 
before the rule that is fed. In such a case an ad hoc decision 
needs to be made as to which rule applies first: when rules 
are intrinsically ordered, the order in which they apply 
follows automatically from universal principles. We shall 
consider some of these principles presently. 
The approach presented in the last section allows both 
extrinsic and intrinsic linear ordering. Some linguists (like 
Koutsoudas et al. 1974 , Ringen 1972, Hooper 1976, Pullum 
1978) have argued strongly against extrinsic linear ordering, 
proposing instead that intrinsic ordering is the only kind of 
rule interaction that should be allowed. Essentially, the case 
against extrinsic linear ordering is that it gives the linguist 
more latitude than is warranted. However, if extrinsic 
ordering is disallowed, the range of legitimate rule inter-
actions is reduced. This has the merit of making it difficult 
to set up underlying representations which differ greatly 

Abandoning extrinsic ordering 129 
from phonetic representations. This seems to be desirable. 
The greater the distance between surface and underlying 
representations, the greater the likelihood of having a very 
involved set of rules interacting in a complex or idiosyn-
cratic way with each other in the mapping of underlying 
onto surface representations. A ban on linear rule ordering 
effectively means that only those underlying representations 
which require rules interacting in a straightforward way can 
be successfully mapped on phonetic representations. Deri-
vations requiring complex rule interaction would abort. 
Let us now see how the phonological rule system 
might operate without extrinsic linear ordering. One 
proposal that has been made involves SIMULTANEOUS 
RULE APPLICATION. It is assumed that the question 
whether or not a given rule applies can be answered by 
inspecting the underlying representation: rule application 
is solely dependent on whether the underlying represen-
tation satisfies the structural description of a given rule. 
We shall return to the Swahili example in [7.18] which 
is reproduced here as [7.22] to illustrate this point: 
[7.22]

[phange]

The underlying representations of these data satisfy the 
structural descriptions of both the nasal deletion rule in 
[7.20] and the obstruent aspiration rule in [7.19]. So, both 
these rules apply directly and simultaneously to the under-
lying representations: 
[7.23] UR / N+taa/ 
/ N+ thaa/ (by [7.19]) and / thaa/ (by [7.20]) 
PR [thaa] 
Extrinsic linear ordering is unnecessary, in cases of this 
kind. 
Another situation in which simultaneous rule appli-
cation could also be used is where rules are MUTUALLY 
NON-AFFECTING. In such a situation any ordering 
would be arbitrary. You can verify this by looking back at 
the English examples and rules in [7.1] to [7.3]. The rules 

130 Interaction between rules 
aspirating voiceless stops, labialising consonants 
before 
rounded vowels and fronting velars before front vowels do 
not affect each other's input. Any ordering of these rules 
would make no difference to the final output. They can 
directly apply at the same time to the underlying represen-
tation whenever their structural description is satisfied. 
Our next example of rule interaction will also be taken 
from English. The relevant rules are [7.24] and [7.25] 
[7.24] Shortening: 
C 
[ + segment] 
••[—long]/ 
[ — voice] 
(Vowels and consonant segments are shortened 
when followed by voiceless segments.) 
The existence of this rule means that the vowel in sat is 
somewhat shorter than that in sad; it also means that the 
[1] in colt is shorter than that in cold. 
[7.25] Obstruent devoicing 
[ —sonorant] 
*- [ — voice]/ 
# 
(Nonsonorants (obstruents) i.e. stops, 
affri-
cates and fricatives are (partially) devoiced in 
word final position.) 
The effect of [7.25] is to make the last segment of each of 
the following words less fully voiced than the first one: bib, 
did and gag. 
Proponents of extrinsic linear ordering would suggest 
that the fact that the vowel segment preceding the devoiced 
/ g / segment in a word like gag does not become shorter even 
when, after the application of [7.25], the word ends in a 
voiceless or partially voiceless velar, is evidence that [7.24] 
applies before [7.25] so that by the time [7.25] applies, the 
opportunity of shortening has already been missed. In other 
words, rule [7.25] on the face of it, could POTENTIALLY 
FEED [7.24] if the ordering of these two rules was reversed. 
But the reality is that it does not. Thus, ordering [7.24] 
before [7.25] ensures that a potentially feeding rule inter-
action is avoided. 
In fact, where rules are in a potentially feeding (also 
called counter-feeding relationship), an approach which 
forbids extrinsic linear ordering would also yield the right 

Abandoning extrinsic ordering 131 
result if it stipulated that rules apply directly to underlying 
representations which satisfy their structural descriptions. 
Thus, it is possible to show that [7.24] applies since its 
structural description is met by the underlying represen-
tation while [7.25] fails to feed [7.24] because the voiceless 
obstruents produced by this rule miss the application of 
[7.24] since both rules are assumed to apply directly to 
underlying representations. No further ordering statements 
are needed. 
Another proposal that has been made by critics of 
extrinsic ordering is RANDOM SEQUENTIAL RULE 
APPLICATION. This principle states that rules apply one 
at a time, rather than simultaneously. But they are not 
strictly regimented in a fixed order. They apply, whenever 
a string that satisfies their structural description arises in a 
derivation. In cases of potential ambiguity, rules are 
arranged in that order which ensures that all obligatory rules 
are applied. 
This principle is needed because the claim made above 
that rules only apply directly to underlying representations 
is not always correct. Earlier in this chapter we established 
that there are rules which cannot apply directly to 
underlying representations and which only become appli-
cable after their input has been created by another rule 
during the course of a derivation. That is the case when 
rules are in a feeding relationship (see [7.11] - [7.15] above). 
The feeding rule must precede the fed rule. But this 
ordering need not be done on an ad hoc basis. The random 
sequential application principle, by ensuring that rules apply 
at any stage in a derivation when their structural description 
is met provides a simple mechanism for arriving at the 
correct order: the structural description of the feeding rule 
must, by definition, be met before the conditions for the 
application of the fed rule are created. So, feeding rules 
must always precede the rules that are fed. 
A further universal principle which renders extrinsic 
ordering unnecessary is the ELSEWHERE CONDITION 
(Kiparsky 1973). The elsewhere condition states that where 
the input to two rules partially overlaps, the more specific 
rule applies before the more general rule. Discussion of this 
principle will wait until section 12.2.3. 

132 Interaction between rules 
7.4 Conclusion: why ordering matters 
It would be wrong to think that in this chapter too much 
fuss has been made over an abstruse theoretical point. This 
is not the case. Rule interaction is not a fringe, esoteric 
issue. The importance of rule ordering lies in the fact that 
it offers us a way of constraining the power of the model. 
A phonological theory, which incorporates powerful rules 
which can insert, move and delete elements enables the 
linguist to perform a very wide range of operations, some 
of which may not be possible in human language. 
It is therefore necessary to find ways of reducing the 
power of the model so that only those operations that are 
possible in human language are catered for. Restrictions on 
rule interaction have the effect of reducing the range of 
possible outputs of phonological rules. Furthermore, restric-
tions on rule interaction also indirectly curtail the distance 
between underlying and surface representations. 
Very 
complex extrinsic rule ordering is required where a large 
number of rules are needed to translate abstract underlying 
representations into phonetic representations. 
The theme of constraining the remoteness of under-
lying representations from phonetic representations is devel-
oped further, from a different angle, in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 8 
The abstractness of 
underlying representations 
8.1 Abstractness 
So far it has been assumed without much discussion that 
normally the alternation in the realisation of a morpheme 
is most appropriately stated by positing a single underlying 
form from which its various alternants are derived by rule. 
Thus, for instance, the forms sign [sain], signal [signal], 
signature [signatja] and signify [signifai] share the underlying 
representation /sign/. It can be argued that in sign the word 
final /-gn/ consonant sequence makes underlying /i/ 
change to [ai], and then /g/ disappears. But in the rest of 
the examples, where various affixes are present, the under-
lying representation /sign/ remains unchanged because in 
those cases the string /-gn/ is not word final. 
Note that the underlying representation /sign/ is 
ABSTRACT, i.e. it is distant from the phonetic form [sain] 
which is actually uttered by speakers. Support for the 
abstract underlying form is drawn not only from the phono-
logical and semantic relatedness of sign, signal, signature and 
signify, but also from the fact that several other sets of forms 
such as malign [malain] ~ malignant [malignant] and benign 
[binain] ~ benignant [binignant] show the same alternation. 
This suggests that the alternation is rule governed. It is not 
a unique characteristic of the form /sign/. To capture the 
relevant generalisation rules changing word final underlying 
/-ign/ into surface [-am] are required. 
The position which I have just outlined appears reason-
able, but it is not entirely uncontroversial. The controversy 
centres round the extent to which phonetic realisations can 
differ from underlying representations. Is there a principled 
way of determining when underlying representations are 

Concrete phonology? 135 
too far removed from surface manifestations of a morpheme 
to be credible? Is there a principled way of determining 
when semantic relatedness is too dilute and phonological 
similarity too tenuous to justify deriving different forms 
from the same base form? Is there a principled way of 
determining when relatedness between different forms is 
only of diachronic interest and has ceased to be synchron-
ically valid? 
These questions are too important to be left to the 
linguist's common 
sense. Phonological 
theory 
would 
become empty if any sound was allowed to change arbi-
trarily into any other sound at the whim of the analyst. 
Principles are needed which would outlaw a maverick 
phonological gambit in which, for instance hundred and 
centenary, or foot and pedal, were derived from the same 
abstract synchronic base. Notwithstanding their semantic 
similarity and faint phonological resemblance, these forms 
are not closely enough related synchronically to be derived 
from the same base form. This begs the question of the 
degree of relatedness that is sufficient to allow the derivation 
of phonetic representations from the same base form. Can 
effective mechanical procedures that determine which forms 
are derivable from the same synchronic source ever be 
devised? Unfortunately, the answer is 'no'. 
In the last chapter we saw one perspective from which 
the problem can be dealt with: restrictions can be placed on 
rule systems, making it impossible to derive phonetic 
representations from 
distant underlying 
representations 
where extrinsic linear rule ordering is required. But even 
if it were desirable, banning linear ordering in itself would 
not be enough. A two-pronged attack is what is needed: one 
prong being the incorporation in the model of as restrictive 
a theory of rule interaction as the facts of language allow 
and the other prong being the development of restrictive 
principles for the setting up of synchronic underlying 
representations. 
8.2 Concrete phonology? 
A knee-jerk reaction might be to simply resort to draconian 
measures like banning all abstract underlying represen-

136 The abstractness of underlying representations 
tations (i.e. underlying representations that are remote from 
surface (phonetic) representations). The dichotomy between 
underlying and surface representations would be abandoned 
and we would have 'CONCRETE PHONOLOGY' with 
only one level of representation, namely the phonetic. But, 
for a number of reasons, this would not be a satisfactory 
solution. 
Abandoning 
underlying 
representations 
would 
be 
unsatisfactory because, as we saw in section 3.4 there is 
redundancy in language. Many phonetic properties of a 
segment are predictable because certain feature combi-
nations either presuppose or preclude each other (e.g. in 
English any nasal consonant is also noncontinuant, nonstri-
dent and voiced). Other properties of a sound may be 
predictable, given the context in which it occurs (e.g. in 
English if we know that a syllable begins with a consonant 
cluster whose second segment is a stop, we can always 
correctly predict that the first consonant of that cluster is 
[s]). Having two levels of representation allows us the possi-
bility of extracting all the predictable phonetic features of 
a morpheme so that we only include the idiosyncratic prop-
erties as part of the underlying representation. All predict-
able features are filled in later by redundancy rules. There 
would be no adequate way of dealing with this redundancy 
in a model of phonology which did not have more than one 
level of representation. 
The second objection is that 'concrete phonology', in 
a literal sense is a chimera (and nobody has ever proposed 
it as a viable alternative) since even so-called 'concrete' 
phonetic representations do not exist. The phonetician, like 
all other scientists never deals with 'brute facts'. Raw data 
is always seen through the lenses provided by the analyst's 
theory. The measurements which laboratory instruments 
are calibrated to make depend on what sort of data the 
analyst considers relevant to testing certain theoretical 
claims. As for the phonetic transcriptions on which phono-
logical descriptions are based, they can never be totally 
faithful to the brute facts. Phonetic transcription is a subtle 
art which involves a degree of interpretation. In view of 
this, a one-level phonological representation identical to a 
phonetic representation could never be concrete, except in 
a metaphorical sense. 

Concrete phonology? 137 
The third objection to an approach which only recog-
nises phonetic representations is that it fails to capture 
significant generalisations concerning relationships between 
allomorphs of a morpheme. You will recall that in Chapter 
5 we saw that usually the relationship between allomorphs 
of a morpheme is not arbitrary. The realisation of allo-
morphs 
tends 
to 
be 
PHONOLOGICALLY 
CON-
DITIONED. For example, listing all the allomorphs of the 
past tense would fail to show the difference between the 
realisation of the regular endings [-t -d -id] as in walked, 
loved and wanted, which are governed by voice assimilation, 
and the totally arbitrary past tense formation of went from 
go. If, on the other hand, underlying representations are set 
up we can show the non-arbitrary relationship between the 
various allomorphs by deriving them from a single base 
form as we did in [5.2]. 
However, the search for underlying representations 
cannot be allowed to proceed without any constraints. It is 
always essential to ensure that putative underlying repre-
sentations are synchronically valid. This is by no means an 
easy matter because for better or for worse, languages have 
to live with undigested bits of their history. Often there is 
no clear division between synchrony and diachrony. Phon-
ological processes which might have been regular, natural 
and motivated at an earlier period in the life of a language 
may only survive as sporadic alternations in a few isolated 
forms. That is true, for example, of the vowel alternation 
in English nouns like: 
[8.1] Singular 
Plural 
goose 
[gus] 
geese 
[gis] 
foot 
[fut] 
feet 
[fit] 
tooth 
[tu0] 
teeth 
[tie] 
During the Middle Ages, many Germanic languages 
underwent changes known as UMLAUT (or i-mutation). 
This is partial assimilation involving the fronting of a 
stressed back vowel in anticipation of a high front vowel 
or glide [i or j] in the next syllable. 
In Old English (which was spoken circa 449-1100 and 
from which modern English is descended) umlaut probably 
began during the sixth century. Originally the nominative 
singular and the nominative/accusative plural of the noun 

138 The abstractness of underlying representations 
foot were fit [fo:t] and fitiz [fo:tiz] respectively, but from 
about the sixth century, the plural form changed to fitiz 
[fe:tiz]. Later the ending was dropped and [fe:tiz] became 
fit [fe:t]. (Later still, around the fifteenth century long /e:/ 
changed to long /i:/; but that change was never reflected in 
the orthography). After the loss of /i/ in the plural suffix 
/-iz/, the alternations survived as ways of marking plural 
in feet and a few other words. But there was no longer a 
phonetic reason for the umlaut alternation and it became 
fossilised. 
If a new product was launched on the market, and it 
was called a voot [vut], there is no likelihood whatsoever 
that two of those objects would be called veet [vit]: this 
internal vowel change in the root is no longer a productive 
process, i.e. it cannot be extended to new forms. Yet, at 
the same time, as [8.1] shows, the alternation between [u] 
and [i] still exists in English and it cannot be disregarded. 
Arguably, to show the relationship between the different 
shapes of the words in [8.1], we could set up a single 
underlying representation for each pair from which the 
surface representations are derived. However, in view of the 
lack of productivity of the alternation between [i] and [u], 
there is a strong case for not setting up a single synchronic 
underlying form for each one of these pairs of words and 
instead showing the relationship between them directly 
using a rule which is part of the lexicon. 
This is one way in which the search for underlying 
representations could be restricted: a single underlying 
representation is only warranted where a given phono-
logical alternation can be shown to be alive and well in a 
language. 
This 
can 
be 
done 
by 
showing 
that 
it 
is 
productively extended to new forms entering the language. 
The fronting of [u] (or [u]) to [i] as in [ 8.1] is unproductive 
while the addition of -5 to voot to form voots [vuts] is 
productive. Addition of -5 rather than fronting of a back 
vowel (umlaut) is the rule which must be included in a 
grammar which aims to model speakers' knowledge of their 
language. 
Unfortunately, our troubles do not necessarily end if 
we take that stance. The difficulty of determining what the 
native speaker knows still remains. If the grammar is a 

Concrete phonology? 139 
model of linguistic knowledge, we must be wary of 
assuming rashly that on every occasion when an ingenious 
linguist can spot a regularity in the alternation in the 
phonetic shape of a morpheme, for which a base form can 
be posited and a rule written, the native speaker too will 
necessarily have such a rule. This was the subject of a heated 
debate in the early seventies. The debate centred on data like 
these from English showing alternative shapes of a root, 
depending on whether a suffix is present: 
[8.2] tense vowel [ei] 
lax vowel [ae] 
vain 
vanity 
sane 
sanity 
opaque 
opacity 
profane 
profanity 
inane 
inanity 
grave 
gravity 
Write down in words the rule which determines the 
quality of the italicised vowel. 
Note that no vowel change occurs in words like fame 
[feim] ~ famous [feimas], base [beis] ~ basic [beisik], fate, 
[feit] ~ fatal [feitl], safe [seifj ~ safety [seifti], etc. 
From your solution can you see why this rule is called 
TRISYLLABIC LAXING? It is a rule which changes a tense 
vowel into a lax vowel when a short word is lengthened 
by adding a suffix so that it ends up having at least three 
syllables. Trisyllabic laxing applies in [8.2] but fails to apply 
to famous, basic, etc. because these contain only two syllables 
after the addition of a suffix. 
This rule is not only responsible for the [ei] ~ [ae] alter-
nation, but also for the [i] ~ [e] alternation in words like 
serene ~ serenity; the [au] ~ [A] alternation in words like 
pronounce ~ pronunciation, the [ai] ~ [1] alternation in words 
like divine ~ divinity, etc. 
Find two other words exemplifying each of these 
patterns. 

140 The abstractness of underlying representations 
These alternations are a synchronic relic of the momen-
tous upheaval in the English vowel system that took place 
during the late Middle English period, around the fifteenth 
century, to which the name the English GREAT VOWEL 
SHIFT is given. Trisyllabic laxing is part of the undigested 
history of the language. 
Not having some kind of rule to show the regularity 
of these MORPHOPHONEMIC ALTERNATIONS (i.e. 
alternative phonological realisations of a morpheme) which 
we have observed would result in a failure to capture 
obvious generalisations. It would mean failure to show that 
the pairs of words in [8.2] are related. But, on the other 
hand, it would be somewhat misleading to claim that the 
rule that relates, say, profane to profanity is every bit as 
synchronically relevant and phonologically well-motivated 
as the allophonic rule aspirating a voiceless stop occurring 
initially in a stressed syllable that relates the aspirated [kh] 
of cake [kheik] to the unaspirated first [k] of [thikeik] tea-cake. 
The issue is that not all regularities that can be identified by 
the linguist have the same status for speakers of a language. 
In view of this, phonologists belonging to the Natural 
Generative Phonology school (e.g. Hooper 1976; Venne-
mann 1974a) have argued that the phonological component 
need only deal with transparent, phonetically motivated, 
regular, productive processes like the aspiration of voiceless 
stops occurring initially in stressed syllables in English. All 
other regularities should be handled by the morphological 
component. 
Where 
psychologically 
valid 
synchronic 
relationship is doubtful, though some semantic and phono-
logical link exists, LEXICAL VIA RULES located in the 
lexicon should be used to indicate the link.1 
Hooper (1976:9), examines the Spanish forms in [8.3] 
which Harris (1969), who favoured a more abstract 
approach, had claimed to be synchronically related: 
[8.3] 
A 
B 
leche 
[letje] 'milk' lactar 
[laktar] 
'to lactate' 
ocho 
[otfo] 'eight' octavo 
[okta|Jo] 
'eighth' 
noche [notfe] 'night' nocturno [nokturno] 'nocturnal' 
Harris used phonological rules, closely reflecting the 
historical development of Spanish from Latin, to derive the 
words in each pair from a single underlying representation 

Concrete phonology? 141 
in contemporary Spanish. His underlying representations 
were respectively /lakte/, /okto/ and /nokte/. His proposed 
rules are illustrated with a derivation of noche: 
[8.4] UR 
/nokte/ 
noyte 
(a) k —* y/ 
noytje 
(b) t -^ 
t f / y _ 
notje 
(c) y —» 0 / 
tj 
P # 
[notjc] 
Though historically valid, the underlying 
representation 
/nokte/ and the two intermediate forms [noyte] and [notje] 
do not occur in modern Spanish. Harris is rebuked by 
Hooper for being too abstract. 
In Natural Generative Phonology where the premium 
is on avoiding abstract solutions, the relationship between 
the pairs of words in [8.3] is shown by Hooper using a via 
rule in the lexicon. This is a statement to the effect that in 
certain forms x corresponds to y: 
[8.5] k t - » t 
A via rule is not productive. Those few items linked by a 
via rule have to be individually marked. Furthermore, a 
particular via rule is not assumed to be part of every native 
speaker's linguistic competence. 
You can see why this should be so by considering 
relationships between some English words, e.g. stink and 
stench, drink and drench, break and breach. The words in each 
pair are semantically and phonologically related. But prob-
ably most speakers of English are unaware of this fact. 
Those who arc aware of the connection may have a via rule 
linking each pair. 
The 
treatment of sounds 
in language 
acquisition, 
language change and dialectal variation would 
provide 
windows through which speakers' phonological knowledge 
could be glimpsed. For instance, the fact that the productive 
rule of plural formation in modern English is the addition 
of /-z, -IZ, -s/ can be seen in the way children sometimes 
ovcrgeneralise /-z/ and form *mans (instead of men) as the 
plural of man. They do not analogise in the other direction 
making the plural of e.g. pan and van *pen and *ven (instead 
of the correct pans and vans). A fundamental contention of 

142 The abstractness of underlying representations 
these scholars is that linguists should posit as underlying 
representations only those forms that can be plausibly 
learned by induction on the basis of the phonetic evidence 
which a child is exposed to. 
The sceptic might retort that the effect of these 
proposals is not to solve the problem but rather to shunt 
it into a morphological or lexical siding. Proponents of 
Natural Generative Grammar are aware of this possible crit-
icism. They provide a battery of principles to be used in 
deciding whether or not a transparent phonological relation-
ship exists between forms which the linguist wishes to relate 
using synchronic phonological rules so that problem cases 
are not dispatched too hastily to the lexical via rules. 
We could simply insist that the underlying represen-
tation must be IDENTICAL to one of the phonetic repre-
sentations of a given morpheme, i.e. one of the allomorphs 
should be selected as the underlying representation. Let us 
return to the data in [8.2] to illustrate this. If we choose 
/vein/ as the underlying representation of vanity [vaeniti], 
there is no problem since all the segments of the root 
morpheme do surface in a single shape of the word vain 
[vein]. 
Unfortunately the principle stated above fails in some-
what more complex situations like that described below in 
Russian where the underlying form would need to be 
cobbled together from more than one surface 
form. 
Consider the data in [8.6] and [8.7] (based on Kenstowicz 
and Kisseberth:i979). 
[8.6] vowel neutralisation 
Pes 
'forest' 
Pisa 
'forests' 
gorat 
'town' 
garada 
'towns' 
[8.7] Final obstruent devoicing

'boot'

'boots'

There is a rule which has the effect of neutralising 
vowels in [8.6]: in stressed positions Russian has the vowels 
/ i a e o u/ but in unstressed position the contrast between 
underlying /i/ and /e/ is suspended and both are realised 
as /i/. Likewise, when unstressed, /o/ and /a/ do not 

Concrete phonology? 143 
contrast: they are both realised as [a]. Only / u / appears in 
both stressed and unstressed syllables. (As a result of vowel 
neutralisation 
only 
the maximally 
perceptually 
distinct 
peripheral vowels /i a u/ occur in unstressed position.) The 
vowel neutralisation rule is presented in [8.8]: 
[8.8] Vowel neutralisation 
(a) 
(b) 
-high 
—back 
e 
- h i g h 
— back 
+ round 
[+high] 
+low 
— round 
/ [—stress] (i.e. / e / 
occurs 
unstressed) 
/ [-stress] (i.e. / o / 
occurs 
unstressed) 
To account for the devoicing of obstruents (d —» t, z 
etc.) seen in [8.7] the following rule is required: 
[8.9] Final obstruent devoicing 
[—son] —» [—voice] / 
# 
s, 
Explain why, given the existence of rules [8.8] and 
[8.9], establishing the underlying 
form 
of words 
like 
gorat/garadi 'towns' is problematic if you assume that one 
of the allomorphs of a morpheme is the base form from 
which other alternants are derived. 
The problem is that no single phonetic representation 
contains all the segments which must form part of the base 
form. Given [8.8] the unsuffixed forms in the left-hand 
column provide the correct representation of the underlying 
vowel which reveals itself under stress; but given [8.9], the 
forms in the right-hand column contain the underlying 
voiced obstruent which is devoiced in word final position. 
This problem is solved by a weaker proposal which 
merely requires that SEGMENTS POSITED AS U N D E R -
LYING APPEAR IN AT LEAST O N E ALLOMORPH of 
a morpheme. But all the properties of the underlying 
representation need not occur together in one of the allo-
morphs. The phonologist is allowed to posit as underlying 
a composite form containing segments which surface in 

144 The abstractness of underlying representations 
distinct allomorphs of the morpheme. 
The 
underlying 
representations of the Russian forms are Ijes, gbrat, sapbg and 
ruk, which are not necessarily attested as such in the super-
ficial phonetic representations (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth 
1979)-
These Russian data also illustrate another important 
principle which has to be observed in setting up underlying 
representations. It is the principle of PREDICTABILITY. 
If two analyses appear to describe the data adequately, that 
analysis which has greater generality, i.e. greater predictive 
power, is preferred. 
In order to account for the data in [8.6] and [8.7], we 
could have regarded the roots as either ending in voiced or 
voiceless obstruents in the underlying representation. We 
could have posited /les/, 0g6rat/, /sapok/, /raz/ and /ruk/ 
as the underlying representations. A rule would have been 
needed to voice obstruents when they occur 
between 
vowels. 
Write up that hypothetical obstruent 
voicing 
rule 
formally. 
The obstruent voicing rule could be stated as: 
[8-9] -son 
-voice 
['+voice] 
/ V 
V 
Rule [8.9] would correctly predict [garada], [sapaga] and 
[razi] but it would wrongly predict the voicing of the 
obstruent in *[lJiza] and *[rugJi]. By ad hoc measures, like 
using a diacritic to distinguish those obtruents 
which 
undergo voicing rule [8.9] from 
those which defy 
it, 
embarrassing exceptions might be swept under the carpet. 
But there is nothing to commend such a solution. 
There is a better alternative. If we posit underlying 
voiced obstruents as the last root consonants in /gorad/, 
/sapog/, and /raz/, we can apply the devoicing rule [8.9] 
to all forms which satisfy its structural description. Base 
forms like /Pes/ and /ruk/ which end in voiceless consonants 
are unaffected by the rule. There would be no need to resort 
to ad hoc measures to explain away exceptions. 

Absolute neutralisation 145 
8.3 Absolute neutralisation 
In the SPE version of generative phonology a high degree 
of abstractness was tolerated if it enabled the linguist to 
capture generalisations - so long as it was not too 'costly'. 
Very abstract solutions and complex derivations though not 
encouraged, were not prohibited. It was considered legit-
imate to posit underlying abstract 'ghost segments' which 
never occur in the phonetic realisation of any morpheme of 
a language but which nonetheless can be inferred on the 
basis of regular phonological alternation. 
I shall use some facts about French which have received 
considerable attention 
in the literature to explore 
the 
problem of abstractness and particularly the issue of ghost 
segments: 
[8.10] (a) le pic 
[la pik] 
'the pickaxe' 
l'abbe 
[labe] 
'the abbot' 
(b) le hasard 
[b aza:r] 
'the accident' 
la hirondelle 
[la ir5del] 
'the swallow' 
As [8.10] shows, French has a rule of vowel deletion 
[8.11] V -* 0 / 
+ V 
which, in this case, deletes the vowel of the definite article 
when the article is followed by a noun beginning with a 
vowel. This rule applies to yield [labe] from / b abe/, but does 
not apply to / b 
pik/ where the noun begins with a 
consonant. 
In [8.10b], the nouns are spelled with consonant h as 
their first letter, but that h is not pronounced. Phonetically, 
the first sound of both [le aza:r] and [la ir5del] is a vowel. 
Therefore one would expect the vowel deletion rule to 
apply to the article. In fact, as you can sec, vowel deletion 
fails to apply in these and many other words beginning with 
the h in the orthography although that h is 'mute' e.g. le 
hale [b al] 'tow-line', la harengere [la arfi3e:r] 'fish-wife' le 
hall [b D1] '(hotel) lounge', le harem [b arem] 'harem', le 
hideur [b idce:r] 'hideousness', le hongre [b 5:gr] 'gelding', la 
Iwue [la u] 'hoe' and even le hold-up [b oldoep] 'hold-up' and 
le home [b o:m] 'home (as in "children's home")'. 
It has been proposed in the literature that although such 

146 The abstractness of underlying representations 
stems phonetically begin with a vowel, they should be 
deemed to begin with an abstract /h/ segment in the under-
lying phonological representation which is peculiar in that 
it always fails to surface phonetically (Schane 1968). 
But others have suggested that it is unnecessary to 
insit that the sound that blocks the vowel deletion rule is 
indeed /h/. It is sufficient to assume that there is a very 
UNDERSPECIFIED consonant which is only represented 
by the residual feature [ +consonant]. That is enough to 
block the vowel deletion rule since that rule is only appli-
cable where the noun begins with a vowel. Furthermore, 
only being specified for the feature [+consonant] means that 
the abstract segment cannot surface phonetically (i.e. be 
uttered). Much fuller phonetic specification is required 
before pronunciation is possible (Clements and Keyser 1983). 
This line of argument is persuasive. We shall return to 
it in [9.6] below. 
While with regard to French positing an abstract 
segment is plausible, there are situations where the argu-
ments for abstract non-surfacing segments are less per-
suasive. That is the case with respect to Luganda vowels. 
In this language the five vowels /i e a o u/ are the only 
ones which appear on the surface; vowel length can be 
distinctive: 
[8.12] Short vi 
[sima] 
[tema] 
[mala] 
[wola] 
[tuma] 
owel 
'dig a hole!' 
'cut!' 
'finish!' 
'lend' 
'send' 
Long vowel 
[si:ma] 
[te:Ba] 
[ma:la] 
[wo:la] 
[tu:ma] 
'be grateful!' 
'guess!' 
'smear!' 
'scoop!' 
'heap!' 
Although phonetically there are two high vowels, 
namely [i] and [u] (which can be long or short), they 
condition different phonological processes. Sometimes a 
stop followed by [i] or [u] undergoes SPIRANTISATION 
(i.e. becomes a fricative) and sometimes it does not. Since 
sounds normally display consistent phonological behaviour, 
we would expect the same sound to behave in the same way 
whe"n it occurs in identical phonetic contexts. Consider the 
data in [8.13] where no spirantisation occurs before high 
vowels: 

Absolute neutralisation 147 
[8.13] No spirantisation before [i] and [u]

'ear' 
'what?' 
[mukutu] 
'canal' 
'cage' 
[mudumu] 
'pipe'

In contrast with the [i] and [u] vowels in [8.13], those 
in [8.14] and [8.15] trigger off the spirantisation of a 
preceding nonlabial consonant. 
(Note that labials are 
exempt from spirantisation.) 
After examining the data below, suggest a rule to 
account for spirantisation.

The account of spirantisation so far is somewhat inex-
plicit. The word 'certain' is too vague to characterise the 
vowels which condition spirantisation. To make it more 
explicit one possible move that could be adopted is to use 
a DIACRITIC FEATURE. An advocate of this less abstract 
solution could argue that since the vowels triggering spiran-
tisation are phonetically indistinguishable from those which 
do not, the best solution is to use an arbitrary diacritic, 
which is totally devoid of phonetic content, to identify the 
relevant vowels. In the dictionary morphemes which cause 
spirantisation 
would 
be 
marked 
with 
a 'flag' 
saying 
'[+spirantisation] rule'.3 That would be done to morphemes 
like the agentive nominalising suffix / - i / (similar in meaning 
to /-er/ in English words like maker) or the stative noun and 
adjective suffix /-u/. 
On the other hand, a .proponent of a more abstract 
approach might interpret 
the evidence differently. 
For 
instance, Herbert (1974) suggests that the fact that some 
high vowels cause spirantisation while others do not can be 
attributed to an underlying P H O N O L O G I C A L difference 
between the vowels. The vowels which cause spirantisation 
could be represented as j'\j and /u/ respectively. They have 
different distinctive feature matrices from those of /i/ and 
/u/ which do not cause spirantisation. 
The phonological feature that distinguishes the vowels 
which cause spirantisation from those which do not might 
be [ + tensc] (or [ + extra high]). Essentially, this position 
amounts to a claim that although only five vowels surface 
phonetically, 
there are seven vowels in the underlying 
phonological representation. The surface, phonetic vowels 
are [i e a o u] (which can be long or short) but the under-
lying vowels arc /i i c a o u u/. The vowels / i / and /u/ are 
ABSOLUTELY NEUTRALISED i.e. they occur in under-
lying representations but the opposition between them and 

Absolute neutralisation 149 
/i/ and /u/ respectively is suspended or neutralized in all 
contexts in the phonetic representation. In other words, the 
extra-high sounds are ABSTRACT SEGMENTS which 
never occur phonetically but they are said to be nonetheless 
phonologically real. Their existence is inferred, as we have 
seen, from the phonological alternations in the language. 
Such an abstract analysis is problematic. First, sanc-
tioning absolute neutralisation means countenancing claims 
about neutralisation which are not normally regarded as 
legitimate. The orthodox view is that when a phonological 
opposition is neutralised, the opposition between sounds 
which contrast elsewhere in the phonetic representation is 
suspended in a specific context (Kiparsky 1968). 
For instance, as you will recall from Chapter 2, in 
English voiced and voiceless stops are distinct phonemes. 
There are words like pull and bull which show that they 
contrast word meaning. In fact, they can contrast in any 
position - except after /s/. There is no possibility of [p] and 
[b] contrasting after /s/ in putative words like [spul] and 
*[sbul]. The latter is not a possible English word. In the 
Luganda example the opposition between j\j and /i/ (or 
between /u/ and /u/) is suspended not just in one specific 
context, but everywhere in the phonetic representation. The 
essence of the criticism is that absolute neutralisation over-
extends the concept of neutralisation. 
A further objection to positing abstract segments which 
are absolutely neutralised concerns LEARNABILITY. As 
our phonological theory attempts to model speakers' 
knowledge of the sound systems of their languages, we 
should not assume underlying segments which infants 
acquiring a language would not be able to infer from the 
phonetic input to which they are exposed. So, although the 
solution which allows two extra-high vowels which never 
surface phonetically is historically sound, it will not be 
warmly embraced here. True, Proto-Bantu, 
Luganda's 
ancestor, had the seven vowels /i i c a o u y/; but at some 
point in the evolution of Luganda the vowel mergers shown 
in [8.17] took place: 
[8.17] Pronto-Bantu 
i 
i 
e 
a 
o 
u 
u 
\ 
/ 
\ 
/ 
Luganda 
i 
u 

150 The abstractness of underlying representations 
The abstract solution, while recognising the mergers at the 
phonetic level, denies their existence at the underlying level 
in present-day Luganda. This implies that phonological 
contrasts can be maintained long after they have ceased 
being realised phonetically. But how could Luganda-
speaking children ever acquire the two extra-high vowels 
/i/ and /u/ which they never hear? 
We can restrict the degree of abstractness of under-
lying representations by insisting that only those segments 
that could be plausibly learned by infants on the basis of the 
phonetic input should be considered possible underlying 
segments. Thus, abstract segments which never occur 
phonetically would be excluded. That would mean that the 
linguist might on occasion have to concede that some of the 
regularities in the phonetic realisation of morphemes are not 
phonologically relevant in a synchronic grammar. 
8.4 Conclusion 
Underlying representations need to be posited in order to 
show relationships between morphemes. But, in setting 
them up, care must be taken to avoid positing base forms 
which are at worst arbitrary or at best historically valid but 
synchronically unmotivated. For the working phonologist, 
the difficulty is that abstractness is a scale rather than a 
dichotomy. It is not possible to establish the absolute cut 
off point beyond which the degree of abstractness becomes 
intolerable: while it might be relatively uncontroversial to 
proscribe ghost underlying extra-high vowel segments in 
Luganda, it would not be as easy to proscribe some form 
of ghost segment in cases like that of the French h- aspire. 
But we should not complain. That is what makes phon-
ology so fascinating.

Notes 
1. 
The interaction between phonology, morphology and 
the lexicon is one of the main issues in linguistic theory 
today. In Chapter 12 another approach, which to me 
appears more promising, is presented. 
2. 
The vowel [i] causes palatalisation of a preceeding velar 
so that /k+i/ —> [kJ] and /g+i/ -* [g*] (but this will be 
ignored as it is not central to the problem which we 
are focusing on). 
3. 
These spirantisation processes affect 
several other 
morphemes. For instance the perfective and the causa-
tive suffixes have the same effects as the agentive 
nominalising suffix shown here. 

CHAPTER 9 
The syllable 
9.1 The syllable 
The syllable is at the heart of phonological representations. 
It is the unit in terms of which phonological systems are 
organised. It is a purely phonological entity. It cannot be 
identified with a grammatical or semantic unit. There are 
syllables like [An] as in unusual which are co-extensive with 
the morpheme; there are syllables like [kaet] cat which are 
co-extensive with the word; there are syllables like [kaets] 
cats which represent more than one morpheme (the noun 
root cat and the plural marker -s) and there are syllables like 
[mAn] and [ki] in [mArjki] monkey which represent only part 
of a morpheme. 
9.2 The representation of syllable structure 
The syllable has received a very considerable amount of 
attention from phonologists, especially in recent years, and 
a number of alternative models of the syllable have been 
offered. A serious attempt to compare them is beyond the 
scope of an introductory textbook of this kind. All that can 
be presented here is a very brief outline of some of the main 
trends before focusing on the one that we shall be using. 
Many phonologists envisage a BRANCHING, HIER-
ARCHICAL syllable structure. For a traditional structuralist 
statement of this position see Pike (1967) and Pulgram 
(1970). More recently, writers like like Kiparsky (1979), 
Halle and Vergnaud (1980), Steriade (1982) and Harris 
(1983) have presented a revamped version of the hierarchical 
branching theory in the framework of a MULTI-TIERED 

154 The syllable 
P H O N O L O G I C A L THEORY. (This is an approach where 
phonological representations are viewed as consisting of a 
number of independent levels that are linked to each other. 
See Chapter 10). On this view, syllable structure can be 
represented as in [9.1]:

Note: a = syllable, O = onset, R = rhyme, 
N = nucleus and M = margin 
Bats consists of one syllable. That syllable has two 
constituents, namely the O N S E T which comes at the 
beginning and the RHYME which follows it. In the first 
syllable 
of e-ver, 
the 
rhyme 
is simple. 
It 
does 
not 
BRANCH. It contains just one constituent: the vowel. The 
rhyme of bats, on the other hand branches. It contains a 
vowel which is followed by a consonant. The examples 
above show that the rhyme is the HEAD C O N S T I T U E N T 
(i.e. the only compulsory constituent) of the syllable. The 
onset is the part that branches off on the left of the rhyme, 
coming from the same node. Thus, in English, it is possible 
for a well-formed syllable to contain no onset, as in the case 

The representation of syllable structure 155 
of the first syllable of e-ver. But it is not possible for a well-
formed syllable to exist without a rhyme. 
The binary 
partition of syllables which we are 
suggesting is supported by versification practices in English: 
[9.2] Two syllables with the same onset but different 
rhymes alliterate (e.g. pan, pet, etc.) while two 
syllables with the same rhyme, but different 
onsets, are said to be rhymes (e.g. pan, man, 
etc.). In contrast, the onset and nucleus (e.g. pan, 
man) do not form a significant grouping for 
verse. 
We noted above that the rhyme is the only essential 
element of the syllable in English. What is true of English 
is also true of other languages. The rhyme is always obli-
gatorily present in all syllables in all languages. What varies 
from language to language are the elements that can be part 
of the rhyme. Typically the nucleus slot in the rhyme is 
occupied by a vowel but occasionally a consonant may fill 
that position, as in [9.1c] above where the final [1] of little 
is syllabic. 
Find two more examples of syllabic consonants in English 
or in some other language. What kind of elements can 
precede or follow the syllabic consonants? Refer back to 
section 3.3.1 on page 43. 
Another model - that of Hyman (1985), has a different 
slant. Hyman suggests that the core of phonological repre-
sentations consists of rhythmic WEIGHT UNITS rather 
than onsets and rhymes or C and V slots proposed by other 
writers (see next section). Segments have weight units 
associated with them underlyingly. But only associations 
between weight units and vowels tend to survive to the 
surface. Normally consonants lose their weight units and 
get re-associated with the weight unit of an adjacent vowel 
by the syllabification rules. Only those segments whose 
association with a weight unit is preserved to the end of a 
derivation are syllabic. 

156 The syllable 
9.3 The CV-tier 
Most current work in theoretical phonology assumes a 
model that incorporates a CV-tier (Consonant-Vowel tier) 
in terms of which the canonical forms of morphemes are 
stated. Precursors of this approach are Hockett (1947) and 
Abercrombie (1967). Using a multi-tiered approach in 
studies of classical Arabic, McCarthy (1979, 1981, 1982) 
has 
shown 
that 
PROSODIC 
TEMPLATES 
(see 
section 10.5 below) are needed to represent sequences of CV 
elements which function as morphemes. Though McCarthy's 
work has great phonological interest, his concerns are 
primarily morphological. 
9.3.1 A generative CV-phonology model of syllable 
structure 
It is Clements and Keyser (1983) who have expounded a 
CV-model of phonology specifically designed to deal with 
the syllable. Theirs is the model that I shall use in the rest 
of the book. Clements and Keyser require the theory of the 
syllable to perform three tasks:1 
[9.3] (a) state universal principles governing syllable 
structure; 
(b) state syllable structure TYPOLOGY, 
i.e. 
define the range within which syllable struc-
ture may vary from language to language; 
(c) state language-specific rules governing syllable 
structure 
In order to fulfil function (a), the syllable is assumed 
to have a THREE-TIERED STRUCTURE consisting of 
a SYLLABLE NODE 'a'; a CV-TIER whose C and V 
elements DOMINATE (i.e. have below them as constitu-
ents in the syllable tree) consonantal and vowel segments; 
and a SEGMENTAL TIER consisting of bundles of distinc-
tive feature matrices which represent consonant and vowel 
segments (for convenience these features may be abbrevi-
ated using letters of the phonetic alphabet): 

The CV-tier 157 
[ £ M ] Syllable-tier 
CV-tier 
C 
segmental-tier 
Roughly translated into the terms of the theory in [9.1], 
a V element of the CV-tier represents a syllable NUCLEUS 
i.e. peak of sonority (see below) while a C element 
represents a syllable ONSET or MARGIN, i.e. an element 
which is not the peak. 
Nowadays a CV-phonology model of some sort is 
assumed by many phonologists. The version proposed by 
Clements and Keyser has the advantage of being concep-
tually simpler than the alternatives. Intervening between the 
syllable node and segmental tier there is a 'flat' CV-tier, 
lacking internal constituent structure. Contrast this with the 
more complex syllable models with onsets and rhymes 
which are illustrated in [9.1]. 
As in syntax, a tree like [9.4] shows IMMEDIATE 
CONSTITUENT 
STRUCTURE. 
An element 
is an 
immediate constituent of a higher element within which it 
is contained. This is shown by a constituent being 
IMMEDIATELY DOMINATED by that higher element. 
Thus, in pen the elements CVC of the CV-tier are all 
immediately dominated by o while the elements [p,e,n] of 
the segmental tier are immediately dominated by C V and 
C respectively. 
In a theory where several tiers are posited it is essential 
to specify how the tiers are LINKED. In CV-phonology, 
the linking is done using ASSOCIATION LINES which 
are subject to a WELL-FORMEDNESS 
CONDITION 
(this principle is discussed in more detail in the next 
chapter). To relate the CV-tier to the segmental tier, associ-
ation lines are drawn following certain universal rules. 
Normally, these rules link V elements to [-cons] segments

One of the functions of the syllable in all languages is 
defining syllabicity for segments. Any segment dominated 
by a C-element of the CV-tier is nonsyllabic while any 
segment dominated by a V-element is syllabic. An inter-
esting consquence of this model is that it obviates the need 
for the feature [syllabic] (section 3.3.1): the V element of 
the CV-tier is the constituent of the syllable that contains 
the SONORITY PEAK. 
The class of segments capable of functioning as syllable 
peaks is not arbitrary. It has been noted by generations of 
phoneticians and phonologists that the distribution of 
segments in syllables follows a clear pattern which can be 
stated in terms of the SONORITY HIERARCHY in [9.6] 
below which was suggested by Hooper (1972, 1976). This 
hierarchy was introduced earlier in section 6.2.1. 
[9.6] Sonority hierarchy

2

3 
nasals 
4 
liquids 
5 
glides 
6 
7 
vowels 
greatest sonority 

The CV-tier 159 
The phonological sonority hierarchy has the phonetic 
correlates of openness and propensity for voicing. The more 
sonorous a sound is, the more audible it is likely to be. The 
sonority hierarchy is a mirror image of the strength hier-
archy (section 6.2): sonority is in inverse proportion to 
strength (Hooper 1976). 
The element 
dominated 
by 
V (which in 
other 
approaches is called the NUCLEUS) is relatively more 
sonorous than the consonants that surround it. (These are 
recognised as the ONSET and MARGIN of the syllable in 
other models). In a word like bat, the vowel /ae/ is domi-
nated by V and it is more sonorant than the consonantal 
segments /b/ and /t/ which it is flanked by. The chart in 
[9.6] correctly predicts that vowels are the most likely and 
obstruents the least likely segments to be dominated by V, 
with other sounds occupying intermediate points on the 
hieararchy. 
As the syllabic potential of a sound depends on its 
propensity to vocalise, it is only to be expected that the 
more open a vowel is, other things being equal, the more 
likely it is to be the peak of sonority in its syllable. The 
algorithm (i.e. formal procedure) that assigns syllabicity 
works by ranking consonants and vowels on the sonority 
hierarchy. The most sonorous segment is assigned to the 
V-element (the nucleus). Less sonorous sounds preceding 
the nucleus are assigned to the initial C-element (onset) and 
those following it are assigned to the other C-element (also 
variously known as the CODA, MARGIN, or TAIL). This 
principle predicts that the vowel /u/ is dominated by a V-
element in [9.5a]. 
It also predicts that, in [9.7] the vowel /u/ is initially 
assigned to the V-element because it is higher up the 
sonority hierarchy than the consonant /m/ which precedes 
it. But when the fact that it is followed by /a/ is taken into 
account, association lines need to be re-drawn, making /a/ 
the only [-cons] dominated by V and linking /u/ instead 
with the preceding C-element. This makes it a nonsyllabic 
glide: 
Clements and Keyser's model performs the second task 
of describing syllable typology by including a range of 
CORE SYLLABLES. Linguistic elements which are part of 
the CORE GRAMMAR are present in all langauges. At the

level of the syllable, CV type syllables meet that require-
ment. So far, no language has been reported to lack CV 
type syllables. Other syllable types may be seen as modi-
fications of the prototypical CV syllable. Many languages, 
English included, have syllables containing only V, (see e-
ver). Such languages may be assumed to have a rule at the 
entry to the phonological component which deletes the 
syllable initial C and thus allows canonical syllables with V 
only. Languages may also have CVC syllables which are 
obtained by a rule which adds a C after the V element to 
form canonical CVC syllables. Languages may have any 
one of the following canonical syllable types: 
[9.8] Type 1: CV 
e.g. ta 
Type 2: CV, V 
e.g. ta, a 
Type 3: CV, CVC 
e.g. ta, tat 
Type 4: CV, V, CVC, VC e.g. ta, a, tat, at 
(based on Clements and Keyser 1983:29) 
Make up two long words (in a real or imaginary language) 
which have each one of the four syllable types in [9.8]. 
Further embellishments of the syllable types in [9.8], 
peculiar to different languages, do occur. To fulfil the third

The CV-tier 161 
mechansim is needed to deal with language-specific syllable 
structure principles. There are languages which allow core 
syllables to have C* or V* (where C* or V* represents 
sequences of C or V elements) so that well-formed core 
syllables may contain combinations like CCCVCC or 
CCVVC or V elements. Thus, while [9.5] only shows 
single C and V elements following each other, languages 
like English allow syllables with CCCVCC sequences as 
in the word strand. The theory has to provide a mechanism 
for stating such language-specific facts. We shall explore this 
in section 9.4.1. 
9.3.2 Syllabification 
The theory has to provide a way of grouping arrays of CV 
elements into syllables in situations like this: VCVCCCVC. 
From the foregoing it is clear that each V-element will be 
associated with a syllable peak. What is yet to be shown is: 
to which 
syllable node are C-elements 
assigned 
in 
ambiguous cases, where they could go with either the 
preceding or the following vowel? To which syllable, for 
example, should the middle consonant of panic (CVCVC) 
be assigned? 
The ONSET FIRST PRINCIPLE (Kahn 1976, Clem-
ents and Keyser 1983) has been proposed to deal with such 
situations. It is stated in [9.9]: 
[9.9] (a) 'Syllable-initial consonants are maximised to 
the extent consistent with the syllable struc-
ture conditions of the language in question. 
(b) Subsequently, syllable-final consonants are 
maximised to the extent consistent with the 
syllable structure 
of the language in 
question.' 
(Clements and Keyser 1983:37) 
Principle (a) applies before (b) in any derivation. In 
potentially ambiguous cases initial consonant clusters take 
precedence over syllable final ones. This means that unless 
there is an overriding language-specific reason for doing 
otherwise, given a string like VCV, the Onset First Prin-
ciple requires that the string be divided up as V-CV rather 
than VC-V : a word like ever [eva] is divided up as [e-va] 

162 The syllable 
and not *[ev-a]. To take another example, English allows 
CC sequences like [sp]. They can be initial as in spoon or 
final as in grasp. In a word like aspire, where the [sp] cluster 
could be regarded as syllable initial or syllable final, the 
word can be syllabified as either a-spire or asp-ire. The Onset 
First Principle predicts that the former is the correct 
syllabification. 
The theory incorporates 
the following 
algorithm 
(formal, step-by-step procedure) for building syllables, with 
the procedures being applied starting from V outward to 
successive C-elements in the order specified in [9.10] below, 
which is based on Clements and Keyser (1983:38): 
[9.10] (a) Underlyingly every V of the CV-tier is linked 
to o; this merely reflects the fact that no 
syllable exists without a V element (as 
nucleus). 
(b) Link each C element to the nearest V-element 
to its right provided the resulting sequence 
of segments does not violate any language-
specific rules. This procedure creates syllable 
onsets. 
(c) Repeat the procedure in (b), this time linking 
the C-elements to the nearest V to its left. 
This procedure creates syllable margins. 
The effect of this algorithm is illustrated in [9. n ]

By convention [9.10b], link C-elements to

the resulting sequence is permissible in the 
language in question. Thus, in this case the 
procedure creates sen but stops short of *nscri 
because in English nasals are not allowed to 
occur at the beginning of a syllable initial 
consonant cluster (see section 9.4.1 below).

It must be emphasised that any 
language-specific 
restrictions on consonant clustering override universal prin-
ciples. For instance, since tl- is not a permissible combi-
nation syllable-initially in English, a word like atlas, the Onset 
First Principle notwithstanding, cannot be syllabified as *a-
tlas; rather it must be divided up as at-las. Universal prin-
ciples can be viewed as providing the default state of affairs 

164 The syllable 
which applies, unless specific instructions to the contrary are 
given by the grammar of a particular language. 
9.4 Functions of the syllable 
In early 
generative phonology, 
although 
the 
feature 
[syllabic] was used, the syllable was not given a place in the 
theory. It was assumed that segments, boundaries and rules 
stating permissible combinations of segments in morphemes 
and words were sufficient to describe the sound systems of 
languages. That is the stance taken in SPE. But subsequent 
work (e.g. Hooper 1972; Vennemann 1972; Bell and 
Hooper 1978; Kiparsky 1979; Selkirk 1980) showed that 
there are good reasons for rejecting that position. Today the 
place of the syllable is secure. Below I show the central role 
it plays in phonology. 
9.4.1 The syllable as the basic phonotactic unit 
One of the most basic functions of the syllable is to regulate 
the ways in which lower level units (consonants and 
vowels) of the phonological hierarchy can combine. 
Knowledge of the phonological system which speakers 
of a language have consists in part of a knowledge of the 
phonemes of that language and their allophones. But this 
is not all. 
Suggest at least one reason why phonological knowl-
edge must go beyond knowledge of phonemes and their 
allophones. Use the data in [9.12] to support 
your 
argument. 
[9.12] *f/eg 
(compare [buf/eg] bootleg) 
*ndziz 
(compare [m3tj"3«rfaiz] merchandise) 
*bmit 
(compare [sA^mit] submit) 
*psrrj 
(compare [kalse/^irj] collapsing) 
What [9.12] illustrates is the importance of constraints 
on the combination of sounds. All the starred pseudo-words 

Functions of the syllable 165 
contain English phonemes; all the consonant sequences at 
the beginning of the pseudo-words are permissible in 
English: [tl] occurs in bootleg, [nd] occurs in merchandise, 
[bm] occurs in submit and [ps] occurs in collapsing. But, the 
sequences in [9.12] are not potential English words. Just as 
at the level of grammar not all sequences of words produce 
a well-formed grammatical sentence, so it is in phonology: 
not all combinations of sounds produce possible words. 
Some non-occurring nonsense words, like those in [9.12] 
are beyond the pale, while other non-occurring words could 
easily be turned into real words if a meaning could be found 
for them. For instance, if you invented a machine which 
automatically does phonological analysis, you could call it 
by any one of these names: 
[9.13] [fonalaiza] 
[ausl]

As a speaker of English, you know that the non-occurring 
words in [9.13] are potential words while those in [9.12] are 
not. The rules which reflect speakers' knowledge of what 
combinations of sounds are allowed in their language are 
variously referred to as PHONOTACTIC RULES or 
MORPHEME STRUCTURE CONDITIONS. 
The syllable is the unit in terms of which phonotactic 
rules are best stated. Thus, for instance, in English the 
sequence [tl] is allowed so long as the t and the / belong to 
different syllables as in boot-leg [but-leg], at-las [set-Is], part-
ly [pat-li] or litt-le [lit-J] (syllabic / is the nucleus of the 
second syllable (see [9.1c]). But the sequence tl is not 
allowed in the same syllable. Hence the impossibility of 
*tleg as an English word since it has tl as a syllable onset. 
Likewise, [bm] can occur in English if there is a syllable 
boundary separating them as in sub-mit but [bm] would not 
be allowed where those two sounds belonged to the same 
syllable as in our imaginary word *bmit. 
Another English example of a phonotactic constraint 
is the rule which only allows vowels to follow syllable-
initial affricates: while cheap, judge and adjust are English 
words, *chleep, *jpudge and *adjpudge are neither real nor 
potential words in English. 

166 The syllable 
Supply three examples of your own of: 
(a) non-occurring possible words in English; 
(b) non-occurring impossible words in English. 
Explain the grounds for your decisions. 
Constraints on syllable structure serve as a filter 
allowing only certain sound sequences to occur. These 
constraints are specific to a particular language. What is a 
well-formed syllable in Swahili may not be in English. In 
Swahili (and in many other African languages) for instance, 
NC sequences like [nd] as in [ndugu] 'brother' or [rjg] as 
in [rjguruwe] 'pig' are allowed in syllable- (and word-) 
initial position but they are outlawed in that position in 
English: *[ndu], *[mpig] and *[gget] are not potential 
words in English. (That is why the names of African leaders 
like Nkrumah and Nkomo tend to have a short [i] or [a] 
vowel inserted before them to make them pronounceable 
by English speakers.) 
The nativisation of foreign loanwords and the phenom-
enon of'foreign accent' provide interesting evidence of how 
deeply ingrained syllable structure rules are. For the same 
reason that native speakers of English insert a vowel before 
a word-initial (and syllable-initial) velar nasal in words like 
Nkrumah, speakers of languages like Walpiri (Australia) and 
Luganda, which only have syllables ending in V in the 
phonetic representation, will insert a vowel after a syllable-
final consonant in borrowed words such as [wAn] 'one'. In 
Walpiri one is rendered as [wani] and in Luganda as [wanu]. 
Likewise, English loanwords in Japanese are normally 
modified to fit in with the predominantly CV syllable struc-
ture of the language. So, 'baseball' and 'milk' become 
[besuboru] and [miruku] respectively. 
9.4.2 The syllable as the domain of phonological 
rules 
The relevance of syllable structure constraints is not 
restricted to loanwords and mother tongue interference. 
Syllable structure often plays an important role in condi-
tioning the application of phonological rules internal to a 
language. 

Functions of the syllable 167 
A frequently cited example of the relevance of the 
syllable in determining whether a phonological rule applies 
is some form of obstruent devoicing rule which is found in 
many languages including Russian, German and Turkish. 
In Turkish it is responsible for alternations like [rengi], 
(possessive), [renkten] (ablative) and [renk] (nominative) 
'colour'; in German for the alternation between [tak] 'day' 
and [taga] 'days'; in Russian for the alternation between 
[gorat] 'town' and [garada] 'towns'. 
The rule can be written as follows: 
[9.14] [-sonorant] —> [-voice]/— 
This rule correctly states that obstruents are devoiced word-
finally or before another consonant. But it misses the point 
that the environments 'word-finally' and 'before another 
consonant' are not accidentally related contexts. The two 
environments share the property of being syllable final. 
The makeshift nature of the solution provided by rule 
[9.14] becomes even clearer when it is appreciated that the 
environment 'word-finally or before another consonant' 
turns up frequently not only with respect to obstruent 
devoicing, but also with respect to other rules. Take the 
nasalisation rule of French (which is similar to a nasalisation 
rule found in numerous languages): 
[9.15] V -» [+nasal] / 
N 
Vowels are nasalised when followed by a preconsonantal 
nasal as in /enfle/ [afle] enfie 'swollen' or word-finally as in 
/bon/ [bo] bon 'good'. 
Account for the nasalisation of the vowel in grand [grfi] 'big' 
and sentiment [satima] 'feeling'. 
The same nasalisation rule applies even where on the 
surface the nasal is not syllable-final in words like sentiment 
[satima] (sentimental [satimatal] 'sentimental'); and grand 
[gra] (grande (feminine) [grad]). A derivation is worked out 
for grand to show this: 
C 
# 

168 The syllable 
[9.16] UR: /grand/ 
Rule a 
Vowel nasalisation before syllable-final NC: 
grand —> grand (see [9.15]) 
Ruleb 
Consonant deletion: grand —» gra (see [7.4]) 
PR [gra] 
(Note: rules a and b may apply simultaneously 
as the underlying representation satisfies the 
structural descriptions of both rules.) 
If the relevance of the syllable is not recognised, the fact 
that the same environment turns up in various rules in 
different 
languages 
remains 
a puzzling 
mystery. 
If, 
however, the syllable is recognised, it becomes obvious that 
these processes are conditioned by the presence of a syllable 
boundary. 
Furthermore, probably in every language there are 
phonological processes whose motivation is the preservation 
or the creation of preferred syllables. The function of such 
rules can only be understood if they are approached in terms 
of the syllable. A classic example in the literature comes 
from the Californian language Yawelmani. In this language 
consonant clusters are allowed only if they do not exceed 
two consonants. When a consonant-commencing 
suffix 
such as the aorist" suffix - hin is added to verb roots whose 
last two segments are consonants, a vowel is inserted 
between the last two root consonants to prevent a tricon-
sonantal sequence from occurring: 
[9.17] root - aorist 
/?ilk - hin/ 
-H> pihkhin] 
'sang' 
/pa't - hin/ 
—> [pa'ithin] 
'fought' 
(t is retroflex) 
If a vowel-commencing suffix like the dubitative suffix 
-al is added, however, no vowel insertion takes place since 
the requirement of a maximum of two consonants in a 
cluster is not violated. (The dubitative mood is used to 
express doubt.) 
[9.18] root - dubitative 
/'ilk - al/ 
-^ pilkal] 'might sing' 
/pa?t - al/ 
—> [pa?tal] 'might fight' 

Functions of the syllable 169 
9.4.3 The syllable and the structure of complex 
segments 
The syllable not only regulates the combination 
of 
segments, it also controls the combination of features which 
make up segments. In this, current thinking differs from 
that of early generative phonology which assumed that 
phonemes were bundles of features 
with these two 
characteristics: 
(i) the scope of each feature was one segment and no 
feature could extend over adjacent segments; 
(ii) within a single phoneme the features were unordered 
which 
meant 
that 
there was no 
subphonemic 
structure. 
Both these assumptions fail in many cases. Frequently 
articulatory gestures are not started and completed within 
a single phonological segment (Firth 1948). Obvious exam-
ples are words like guard-room and barbarism in which the 
feature [+voice] is not restricted to particular segments but 
extends over the entire word. We need not labour the point 
that was made in Chapter 4 that since speech organs are not 
mechanical ratchets, it is only to be expected that articula-
tory gestures are going to overlap in the transition from one 
segment to the next.3 
One of the main functions of the syllable is to provide 
an analysis of the internal structure of segments and to 
indicate the number of rhythmic units present in a syllable. 
This depends on the way C and V elements present on the 
CV-tier are linked with consonant and vowel segments on 
the segmental tier (Hyman 1985). Three patterns of internal 
segmental structure are possible: 
(a) A one-to-one association of V or C with a segment: 
Syllable-tier 
[9.19] 
CV-tier 
segmental-tier 
-cont 
— voice 
+ labial 
— low 
+ syll 
— back 
-high 
+ nas 
+ ant 
+ cor 

170 The syllable 
(b) Simultaneous association of one segment with two C 
or V slots. That is the case when consonants are 
GEMINATED (i.e. the same consonantal articulation 
is held for the duration of two consonantal beats) or 
when a vowel is lengthened (i.e. the same vowel 
quality is maintained over two V slots). I represent 
both possibilities with a Luganda example in [9.20]. 
The word ttaala [t:a:la] 'lamp', begins with a geminate 
t followed by a geminate vowel. 
[9.20] 
00 
c 
c 
(b) 
v 
V 
C 
1 
(c) The third possibility is the simultaneous association of 
a single C slot with two segmental distinctive feature 
matrices. 
This 
is what 
happens 
when 
complex 
segments like affricates occur. Affricates like [pfj, [tf] 
and [d3] are described using the feature [+delayed 
release] in SPE (see section 3.3.6). But they can be 
more revealingly represented in this way: 
[9.21] 
Affricates 
C 
[-cont][ + cont] 
e.g. t 
/ = [tf\ 
This makes the feature [delayed release] superfluous. 
Diphthongs are treated in analogous fashion: 
[9.22] 
Diphthong 
V 
I 
(as in [en] 'eight') 

Functions of the syllable 171 
Many languages have prenasalised consonants which, 
like the complex segments above, do show sequential 
organization of features at the subsegmental level. An 
example of a prenasalised consonant is the sound [nd] as in 
Kikuyu [ndegwal] 'bull'. In the light of [9.21], how should 
pre-nasalised consonants be represented? 
A prenalised consonant can be represented as follows: 
[9-23] 
£ 
C 
/ \ 
A 
[+nasal] [-nasal] 
e.g. 
n 
d 
= [ nd] 
9.4.4 Compensatory lengthening 
In addition, the approach to the syllable outlined in the last 
section accounts in a natural way for some traditional prob-
lems in phonology such as COMPENSATORY LENGTH-
ENING. In many languages, if an underlying syllabic 
segment is deleted or is released as nonsyllabic, an adjacent 
syllabic gets lengthened 'in compensation'. We shall exem-
plify this with the data from Luganda in [9.24]. 
[9.24] /ba+a+lab + a/ [ba:laba] 'they saw' 
(but /ba+ku+lab+a/ [bakulaba] 'they see you') 
/ba+e+lab+a/ [be:laba] 'they see themselves' 
/mu+a+lab+a/ [mwa:laba] 'you saw' 
(but /mu+tu+lab+a/ [mutulaba] 'you see us') 
/li + ato/ [lja:to] 'boat, canoe' 
/ma+ato/ [ma:to] 'boats, canoes' 
The rule is that a high vowel is realised as a nonsyllabic 
glide if it appears followed by another vowel; it is delinked 
from a V slot and re-associated with a C slot (see rule [9.7] 
above). But a nonhigh vowel is deleted altogether if it 
appears followed by another vowel. The motivation for the 
glide formation and vowel deletion rules in Luganda is to 

172 The syllable 
prevent two dissimilar vowels from being adjacent to each 
other in the phonetic representation. Interestingly, the 
number of V-elements on the CV-tier remains stable 
regardless of the fate of the first vowel. How can this be 
explained? 
Let us assume that in the underlying representation 
each C and each V element of the CV-tier has a certain 
amount of potential duration. This can be represented as a 
BEAT or TIMING UNIT (or WEIGHT UNIT). Normally 
only those timing units which are associated with vowels 
survive in the phonetic representation. Timing units tend 
to reflect syllabic peaks because the syllabification rules in 
[9.10] ensure that only the timing unit of the more sonorous 
segment is retained when segments are grouped together in 
a syllable. 
We can now interpret compensatory lengthening as 
follows: when the first vowel is deleted or realised as a 
nonsyllabic glide, its V-slot (and timing unit) is inherited 
by the second vowel which becomes simultaneously asso-
ciated with two V slots and hence has virtually the duration 
of two vowels in the phonetic representation:

See if you can find an example of compensatory lengthening 
in a language that you know. 

Functions of the syllable 173 
9.4.5 The syllable as indispensable building block for 
higher phonological domains 
In recent years, phonological research has amassed evidence 
showing that the syllable is the hub of phonological organ-
isation. In many languages, higher prosodic phenomena like 
stress, nasalisation, 
and quantity 
(length) can only 
be 
insightfully described in terms of the syllable because often, 
in order to determine whether a given rule is applicable, the 
number of syllables in a word (or part of a word) has to 
be counted. There are rules which require main word stress 
to fall on a certain syllable of the word which could be, say, 
the last syllable or second syllable from the end (penultimate 
syllable) of a word. We shall preview this kind of rule here 
and return to it in more detail in Chapter 11. 
Which syllable receives stress in the Swahili data in 
[9.27]? 
[9- 27] piga 
pigana 
piganija 
tutawapiga 
'hit' 
'fight', 
'cause to 
fight'. 
'we shall hit them' 
tutawapiganija 
'we shall make them fight' 
The answer is that stress falls on the penultimate 
syllable. The relative position of stress remains the same 
even when the word grows longer with the addition of 
affixes. 
Swahili has another rule which determines whether the 
noun class 9 nasal prefix is syllabic. This rule also takes the 
number of syllables in a word into account: if attached to 
MONOSYLLABIC roots, the nasal prefix is syllabic but 
if attached to longer roots, it is non-syllabic: 
[9.28] (a) nta 
point 
(b) mbuzi 
goat 
ntji 
country 
rjguruwe 
pig 
The 
next 
example 
is from 
Luganda. 
It 
involves 
CLITICS. But before we examine the Luganda data we 
need to digress and clarify the notion of 'clitic'. Typically 
a clitic is an unstressed particle which is attached to a HOST 
(i.e. main) word and is incapable of standing on its own. 

174 The syllable 
Often clitics affect the stress pattern of the host word. A 
clitic attached to the beginning of a word is called a 
PROCLITIC and a clitic attached to the end of a word is 
called an ENCLITIC. Some clitics are derived from self-
standing words. For example, the French first 
person 
pronoun form je (as in je le vois 'I see him') is an inde-
pendent word. But in j'ai 
(from je ai) 'I have' it is a 
PROCLITIC. In English not is a separate word in she is not 
but it is an ENCLITIC in she isn't. Other clitics are not 
derived from independent words e.g. Latin -que 'and' as in 
mensamque 'and the table' (accusative case). The process of 
adding clitics is called CLITICISATION. 
We can now return to Luganda after the digression. In 
this language there is a vowel length rule which is sensitive 
to the number of syllables. Some words of more than one 
syllable end in a long vowel and others in a short vowel. 
The difference between these two word types shows up 
when an enclitic (a grammatical particle attached to the end 
of a word) like the interrogative marker -ki is present. A 
word like mutawama 'trouble' which underlyingly ends in 
a long vowel becomes [mutawa:na:ki] 'what trouble'. But 
a word like mukozi 'worker' which underlyingly ends in a 
short vowel, when cliticised (e.g. when the enclitic inter-
rogative particle -ki is attached to it), becomes [mukozi'ki] 
'which worker' not *[mukozi:ki]. 
Interestingly, in Luganda all monosyllabic roots end in 
a long vowel in the underlying representation. That long 
vowel is shortened in most contexts in the phonetic repre-
sentation. But it is protected and shows up before enclitics 
like the interrogative marker as you can see:

Swahili and Luganda are not extraordinary in requiring 
a count of the number of syllables before deciding whether 
or not a rule applies. Some other languages, for example 
Spanish, do the same. Jaeggli (1980) has shown that there 
are Spanish dialects where the form that a diminutive suffix 
takes depends simply on the number of syllables in the noun 
to which -the diminutive suffix is added: -sita/sito 
is added 
after disyllabic words and -itaj-ito after trisyllabic ones. 
[9.30] 
(a) -sita (Jem.)J -sito (masc.) 
(b) 
Semantically, the addition of a diminutive suffix to a 
noun has the effect of changing its meaning so that it can 
be paraphrased in English as 'a little or insignificant some-
body or something'.

9.5 Syllable weight 
Traditionally the major distinction drawn between syllable 
types found in languages has been between OPEN SYL-
LABLES and CLOSED SYLLABLES. An open syllable ends 
in a vowel while a closed syllable ends in a consonant. In 
some languages syllables typically end in a vowel, that is 
to say, they are open. That is the situation in languages like 
Japanese and Luganda (if syllabic nasals are disregarded). In 
other languages, like French and English, syllables can end 
in a consonant. But, even in those languages which allow 
closed syllables, there is often a clear preference for open 
syllables. In French, for instance, syllable final consonants 
suffer a considerable degree of attrition. There is a rule 
which deletes word final consonants in words like petit [pa 

176 The syllable 
ti] 'little' and preconsonantal consonants as in enfant [dfa] 
'child'. The effect of this deletion rule is to to turn what 
would be a closed syllable into an open syllable. 
The consensus today is that more important than the 
traditional classification of phonological systems in terms of 
open and closed syllables is their classification in terms of 
SYLLABLE WEIGHT. In numerous languages a factor that 
determines the applicability of certain phonological rules is 
the WEIGHT of the rhyme. Essentially, a syllable is LIGHT 
if it contains a nonbranching rhyme as in [9.31]. But a 
syllable is HEAVY if it contains a branching rhyme as in 
[9.32]. The onset seems never to play any role in the 
computation of syllable weight. Consequently, its internal 
structure is irrelevant. 
Generally, languages in which a distinction between 
light and heavy syllables is drawn fall into two camps which 
are shown as type A and type B below. To begin with, for 
convenience, I assume that the syllables have the structure 
given in [9.1] at the beginning of this chapter. 
Type A Languages 
(a) 
In a light syllable the rhyme contains a short vowel as 
in [9-31]: 
[9.31] 
N 
o 
/ \ 
O 
R 
N 
a 
p 
a 
(b) In a heavy syllable the rhyme contains 
either 
(i) a long vowel or diphthong optionally followed by 
one or more consonants; 
or 
(ii) a short vowel followed by at least one consonant 
as in (9.32) 
[9-32]

R 
N

Syllable weight 177 
Type B Languages 
(a) 
In a light syllable the rhyme contains a short vowel. 
As always, the presence or absence of a consonant in 
the onset is irrelevant. But in this case so is the presence 
of a consonant in the margin, following the nucleus: 
[9-33] 
o 
O 
R 
N 
o 
/ \ 
O 
R 
N 
M 
I 
I 
pa

(b) In a heavy syllable the rhyme contains a long vowel or 
diphthong. The presence or absence of any consonant 
in the margin being again irrelevant.

Probably Latin is the best known example of a type A 
language. Stress placement in Latin was governed by a rule 
which was sensitive to syllable weight: 
[9.35] Latin Stress Rule 
(i) In disyllabic words, stress the first syllable, 
as in [re-go:] rego 'I rule' 
(ii) In a word of more than two syllables, stress 
a heavy penultimate syllable (the second 
syllable from 
the end of the word). 
A 
syllable is heavy if it contains a long vowel 
as in 
[i-ni-mf:-kus] 
inimkus 
'enemy' 
or, 
alternatively, if in the margin, following the 
vowel there is a consonant as in [re:-ksis-tis] 
rexistis 'you (plural) ruled'. 
(iii) If the penultimate syllable is short and has 
no consonant in the margin, it is regarded 
as light and stress in that case is placed on 
the antepenultimate syllable, as in [l-nsu-la] 
insula 'island' 

178 The syllable 
Syllable weight is at the heart of Latin 
METRE. 
Traditional Latin primers, like Kennedy 
(1948:203) 
on 
whom the account here is based, have taught generations 
of students that a VERSE (i.e. line of Latin poetry) consists 
of a certain number of FEET. Each foot is made up of two 
or more syllables. One of the syllables in the foot, usually 
the heavy one dominates the other(s). Usually the metrically 
dominant part of the foot is called the RISE (_) and the 
weaker part is called the FALL (u). The principal feet in 
Latin poetry are listed in [9.36] 
[9.36] IAMBUS: 
one light syllable followed by a 
heavy one 
e.g. card 'flesh' (" Fall, ~ Rise) 
TROCHEE: 
one heavy syllable followed by a 
light one 
e.g. mensa 'table' (~ Rise, ~ Fall) 
ANAPAEST: two light syllables followed by a 
heavy one 
e.g. patulae 'broad' ( ^w Fall, "Rise) 
DACTYL: 
one heavy followed by two light 
ones 
e.g. litora 'shore' ("Rise, 
ww Fall) 
SPONDEE: 
two heavy syllables 
e.g. herds 'hero' ( wFall - Rise; or 
" Rise ~ Fall) 
TRIBRACH: three light syllables 
e.g. temere 'to fear' ( °FaIl, "Rise; 
or - 
Rise, 
wFall) 
The spondee and tribrach arc rare. The common feet all 
share the characteristic of having strong, dominant syllables 
which alternate with weak ones. 
Let us leave Latin and turn to an example of a type B 
language. We have borrowed Larsen and Pike's (1949) data 
from the Mexican language Huasteco for our illustration. 
Work out the placement of stress in this language, 
showing the interaction between stress and syllable weight. 
Vowel length is phonemic and it is indicated by a colon in 
the usual way. An apostrophe after a consonant shows that 
it is globalised. The accent marks stress.

' game, plaything' 
/'e:la: wa:j/ 
'( t n ey) surely find each other' 
I hope you have worked out a statement along these 
lines for predicting stress placement in Huasteco: 
[9-39] (i) If a word contains one or more long vowels, 
stress falls on the syllable with the last long 
vowel, 
(ii) If a word contains no long vowels, stress falls 
on the first syllable. 
The upshot of this discussion is that while the rhyme 
plays a role in determining the applicability of stress rules, 
the onset does not. As a rule, in order to apply rules, it is 
necessary to know the constituent structure of the rhyme 
but not that of the onset. The crucial characteristic of 
rhymes has been formally stated in the literature in terms 
of the BRANCHING RHYME HYPOTHESIS: a syllable 
with a nonbranching rhyme, is light while a syllable with 
a branching rhyme is heavy. The difference between type 
A languages like Latin and type B languages like Huasteco 
is accounted for by assuming the tree geometry in [9.40] 
and [9.41] respectively for these languages. 
The metaphor of PROJECTION 4 has been used to 
express the principle at stake: in quantity-sensitive stress 
systems, where syllable weight plays a key role, we could 
say that as far as the stress rules are concerned, the syllable 
onset is not relevant, it is not 'seen'. What is projected (on

an imaginary screen, as it were) and 'seen' by the stress 
rules is the rhyme. In type A languages what is watched out 
for is branching anywhere in the rhyme, be it at the level 
of the nucleus and margin, or within the nucleus itself. In 
type B languages, on the other hand, only the nucleus is 
projected. The question whether branching occurs is only 
asked about the nucleus. 
Let us now return to the CV-tier model and restate 
syllable weight within that framework. In CV-tier phon-
ology the differences between type A and type B languages 
can be accounted for by assuming that only V (and the 
segments it dominates) and any C following the V element 
is projected. The situation in the two types of language is 
shown in [9.42] and [9.43] respectively. (I have boxed off 
the elements that are projected.)

9.6 Abstract segments 
The theory of the syllable outlined here also succeeds in 
throwing some light on one of the most recalcitrant prob-
lems in phonology: the problem of abstract segments. In many 
languages 
phonologists 
have discovered 
that 
'ghost 
segments' which do not appear in the phonetic represen-
tation may affect the way in which phonological rules apply 
(see Chapter 8, section 3, pages 145-146). 
Consider the facts of French which are shown in [9.44] 
and [9.45]: 
[9- 44][labe] 
[lane] 
[leta] 
[lidantite] 
1(e) abbe 
1(a) annee 
1(e) etat 
1(a) identite 
'the abbot' 
'the year' 
'the state' 
'the identity' 

182 The syllable 
A rule deletes the vowel of the definite article when the next 
word begins with a vowel: 
[9.45] Vowel truncation 
[-cons] -H> 0/ _ # 
V 
The consonant-commencing nouns in [9.46] are unaffected: 
[9. 46][b bwa] 
le bois 
'the forest' 
[la karafj 
la carafe 
'carafe, water-bottle' 
[b pa] 
le pas 
'step, pace' 
[la maladi] 
la maladie 
'illness' 
In the light of the solution provided above, how should 
words below commencing with the so-called 'H ASPIRE' 
be represented in underlying lexical representations? Justify 
the rule which you propose. (You might find it useful to 
review first the discussion in section 3 of Chapter 8.) 
[9.47] [le ara] *[lez ara] les haras 'the stud farms' 
[le arpist] *[lez arpist] les harpistes 'the harpists' 
[le er5] *[lcz er5] les herons 'the herons' 
[le ord] *[lez ord] les hordes 'the hordes' 
[le up] *[lez up] les houppes 'the bunches' 
The problem is this: although phonetically they start 
with a vowel, these words behave phonologically as though 
they started with a consonant. This raises questions about 
the nature of that consonant as we saw on page 146. 
The solution which the theory of the syllable outlined 
here enables us to come up with is simple. The theory 
allows C and V elements to exist at the CV-tier without 
being linked to consonant or vowel segments. In that event, 
they do not surface in the phonetic representation — they are 
not pronounced. But phonological rules affecting the CV-
tier would have access to them. 
In the case of h-aspire words, there is an unattached C 
which inhibits the application of the vowel truncation (de-
letion) rule although it is not linked to any concrete sound 
on the segmental tier. The situation can be represented in 
this way: 
a 
a 
[0.48I 
/ \ 
S^ 
iv-4°j 
c 
VC 
V 
I I I 
a r 
a 
haras 'stud farm' 

Extrasyllabicity 183 
9.7 Extrasyllabicity 
The reverse situation also occurs. A segment can be 
phonetically fully specified without being linked by associ-
ation lines to a C or V. Such a 'floating' segment is not part 
of any syllable: it is EXTRASYLLABIC. 
Another French example illustrates this. Instead of 
using the familiar consonant truncation rule (see [7.4] and 
[9.16]) which deletes syllable-final consonants unless they 
are followed by a vowel, we can simply attribute the failure 
of such consonants to surface in the phonetic representation 
to their being extrasyllabic. 
Compare these data: 
[9.49] (a) [pad pres] petit prince 'petty prince' 
(b) [pati tafa] petit enfant 'little child' 
Where the next word begins with a consonant as in 
petit prince [9.50a], the floating underlying final /t/ of petit 
remains unattached at the end of the derivation and conse-
quently fails to surface. But where the next word begins 
with a vowel as in petit enfant [9.50b], a C-element is 
inserted at the CV-tier and the floating underlying /t/ is 
attached to it. The Onset First Principle [9.9] ensures that 
the inserted C (and the segment it dominates) is attached 
as a syllable onset. 
The /t/ 
is then 
able to 
surface 
phonetically.

This analysis implies that French prefers open syllables both 
in underlying and surface representations. 
Syllable-based rules are not extraordinary in ignoring 
peripheral elements. As we shall see presently, in many 

184 The syllable 
languages stress rules also tend to disregard 
peripheral 
elements in words (see section 11.2.3). 
9.8 Summary 
To summarize, the syllable has the following functions: 
(i) Phonotactic regulation: constraining the combination 
of consonants and vowels of a language. 
(ii) Regulation of subsegmental structure through the CV-
tier. 
(iii) Serving as the unit of the phonological hierarchy in 
terms of which the behaviour of higher units of the 
prosodic hierarchy such as stress, tone, and duration is 
stated.

The 
account 
I have 
presented 
is not 
universally 
accepted. It has been argued by Hyman (1985) that the 
notions of branching rhymes and projection of the 
rhyme only offer a partial explanation of the nature of 
the syllable. This is because they fail to show that the 
units which contribute to syllable weight are also the 
same units which can carry tone, stress and quantity. 
There is nothing in the projection approach that shows 
that this is not mere coincidence. Hyman argues that 
a more illuminating account would be one which incor-
porated the notion of M O R A (timing unit or weight 
unit). Nonbranching rhymes contain one mora while 
branching rhymes contain two. 

CHAPTER 10 
Multi-tiered phonology 
10.1 Introduction to tone languages 
Very 
many 
of the 
world's 
languages 
are 
TONE 
LANGUAGES. They have morphemes which are at least 
in part realised by pitch modulation: pitch differences can 
be used to make phonemic contrasts. Pitch depends on the 
rate of vibration of the vocal cords. The more taut the vocal 
cords are, the faster they vibrate and the higher is the pitch 
of the perceived sound. 
Linguists usually use tone marking diacritics like those 
in [10. i] to represent pitch in tone languages. The diacritics 
are to be interpreted as follows: 
[10. i] ' = low tone e.g. [awo] 'star' (Igala, Nigeria) 
' = high tone e.g. [awo] 'guinea fowl' (Igala, 
Nigeria) 
= mid tone e.g. [awo] 'an increase' (Igala, 
Nigeria) 
= falling 
tone e.g. 
[musana] 
'sunlight' 
(Luganda, Uganda) 
= rising tone e.g. [okpa] 'length' (Gwari, 
Nigeria) 
In tone languages pitch can be used to distinguish word 
meaning or to convey grammatical distinctions. In this 
respect they differ from STRESS (nontonal) languages like 
English where pitch does not have those functions. (See 
section 10.4.i below.) 
The Nigerian language Igala is an example of a 
language which uses pitch differences to contrast word 
meaning:

awo 
'an increase' [~ _] 
awo 'a combV [_ ~] 
awo 
'hole (in a tree) [~ _-] awo 'star' 
[^_] 
In some tone languages tone has a predominantly 
LEXICAL F U N C T I O N . It is used almost exclusively to 
distinguish word meaning. This is generally the case in 
oriental tone languages like Chinese. See [10.5] be)low for 
a well-known Chinese example of the use of pitch to 
distinguish 
word 
meanings. 
However, 
in som^ 
other 
languages the function of tone is primarily G R A M M A T -
ICAL. It is used mainly or exclusively for the signalling of 
grammatical distinctions. This is the case in many African 
languages. All intermediate possibilities between th^se two 
extremes are also possible. 
In [10.3] some data from Longunda (Nigeria) which 
illustrate the use of tone to make grammatical distinctions 
are presented. In this language, there are three sets of 
personal pronouns and in all three sets the 
difference 
between first and second person is expressed tonally:

188 Multi-tiered phonology 
I hope in working out the answer to [10.4] you estab-
lished the fact that tone need not have an exclusively lexical 
or grammatical function. Tone has both lexical and gram-
matical functions in Luganda. The existence of minimal 
pairs like those in [10.4b] shows that tone contrasts word 
meanings while the use of tone to distinguish between main 
clauses and (subordinate) relative clauses in [10.4a] shows 
that tone is also used to make grammatical distinctions. 
Tone languages can be classified as belonging to one 
of two categories on the basis of the shape of their 'pitch 
phonemes': 
REGISTER 
TONE 
LANGUAGES 
and 
CONTOUR TONE LANGUAGES. In an ideal register 
tone language the tones have LEVEL high, mid or low 
pitch. They are almost pure notes. The pitch hardly goes 
up or down during the production of a particular tone. That 
is the case in the Igala examples above. 
In contrast, in a contour tone language, many tones 
have fluctuating pitch as can be seen in the following 
Mandarin Chinese examples: 
[10.5] Chinese 
ma 
'mother' 
(level high tone) [~] 
ma 
'hemp' 
(high rising tone) [~" ] 
ma 
'horse' 
(falling rising tone) 
[v] (also 
referred to as dipping rising or 
low rising) 
ma 
'scold' 
(high falling tone) [~] 
The distinction between contour tone and register tone 
languages is not absolute. In reality most systems display 
some mongrel qualities: a register tone language often has 
a few contour tones, and vice versa. Above, the Mandarin 
Chinese word /ma/ 'mother' has a level high tone although 
contour tones are the norm in that language; and the 
Luganda word /asoma/ 's/he who reads' ends with a 
falling contour tone although the norm in this language is 
level low or high tones. 
10.2 The nature of phonological representations 
Until the mid-1970s the consensus view among phono-

The nature of phonological representations 189 
logists was that phonological representations consist of 
segmental and suprasegmental representations. The segmental 
representations were assumed to be made up of consonant 
and vowel segments, together with empty 
segments 
referred to as syllable, morpheme, word and phrase JUNC-
TURES or BOUNDARIES. Boundaries are included in 
phonological representations to indicate the domain in 
which a particular phonological process takes place (see 
Chapter 12). 
Boundaries may have a conditioning or inhibiting 
effect. Some phonological processes only take when a 
certain boundary is present, or absent. For instance, in 
English voiceless stops are aspirated only if two conditions 
are satisfied: they must be in a stressed syllable and, in 
addition, 
they 
must be immediately 
preceded by a 
SYLLABLE BOUNDARY. Both conditions are met in 
[phen] 'pen' and [dithem] 'detain'; a voiceless stop preceded 
by /s/, e.g. / p / in [spik] 'speak', is unaspirated even when 
it is followed by a stressed vowel because in that position 
the stop is not syllable initial. 
In SPE it was assumed that super-imposed on the 
segmental layer were tone and stress, and possibly a few 
other phenomena such as vowel harmony (i.e. the sharing 
by vowels within a word of certain phonological features 
(see [10.6] below)). Both segmental and suprasegmental 
elements were thought to be arranged in a row one after 
another. The correctness of the assumption that phono-
logical representations consist of linear segmental and supra-
segmental levels was taken for granted for a long time. 
Moreover, the question of how the two levels related to 
each other was not raised in a serious way.1 
In the 1970s a number of studies focused on the 
relationship between segmental and suprasegmental repre-
sentations. The findings arrived at revealed that the assump-
tions that the received orthodoxy was based on were 
questionable. 
The questioning initially took place in 
discussions of the representation of tone. A key question 
that was raised was whether tonal properties such as [high] 
[low] or [rising] should be regarded as properties of a 
vowel, much in the same way that features such as [back] 
or [round] are. Or, rather, were tonal properties to be 
viewed as distinct from the segmental representation of 

190 Multi-tiered phonology 
vowels? Should tone be represented using DIACRITIC 
MARKS like ( / - 
x ) for high, mid and low tone respec-
tively, to indicate its peripheral status? The answers to these 
questions have a bearing on how the nature of phonological 
representations is interpreted. The key issue is whether SPE 
(and structuralist phonology before it) is right in assuming 
that phonological representations are linear, with segments, 
some of them bearing suprasegmental properties, arranged 
in a neat sequence. 
10.3 The representation of tone 
Goldsmith (1976) proposed some interesting answers to 
questions of this kind. He proposed that the division of the 
speech continuum into 'segments' may proceed in different 
ways in different languages. Thus, while the parameters of 
place and manner of articulation, for instance, are normally 
treated as segmental properties belonging to individual 
consonants, there are languages where these properties may 
extend over several segments. Nasalisation is usually a 
property of nasal consonants only, yet in some languages 
it can be a property of the syllable or even the word as a 
whole. The rate of vibration of the vocal cords which 
determines the pitch of a sound can be a property of an 
individual segment, of a syllable or even of an entire word. 
A central claim of the new theory inaugurated by Gold-
smith is that in principle the various articulatory parameters, 
e.g. 
aspiration, 
nasalisation, 
voicing, 
and 
tone 
are 
A U T O N O M O U S and the articulations that result from 
them are, in principle, independent. One of the main tasks 
of phonological theory is to establish the language-specific 
as well as universal principles which regulate the linking of 
these autonomous parameters. Goldsmith called this model 
A U T O S E G M E N T A L P H O N O L O G Y , a name intended 
to highlight the fact that, in this theory, the potential inde-
pendence of the various phonological parameters is regarded 
as crucial, for the reasons outlined below. 
10.3.1 Contour tones 
Contour tones, like rising and falling tones, pose theoretical 

The representation of tone 191 
difficulties for what was the standard generative approach 
to phonology until the mid-seventies. This approach incor-
porated a principle which Goldsmith (1976) refers to as the 
ABSOLUTE SLICING HYPOTHESIS. This is the claim 
that speech can be exhaustively sliced into segments which 
consist of unordered bundles of features which are linearly 
ordered. In an SPE inspired model a word like 'mad' would 
be represented as in [10.6]: 
+ cons 
+nas 
+lab 
—cor 
—cont 
m 
—cons 
+nas 
-lab 
—cor 
+cont 
ae 
+cons 
+nas 
-lab 
+cor 
—cont 
d 
While the assignment of the various features to discrete 
segments in [10.6] might look plausible, the same procedure 
could not be extended to the feature [+voice] in this word 
since [+voice] is a property of the entire word. Nor could 
it be extended to the analysis of pitch here because it too 
could not be vertically sliced and allocated to a single 
segment, without any leakage into adjacent segments. This 
evidence undermines the fundamental claim of the 'slicing 
hypothesis'. As we saw earlier in [4.1], even apparently 
segmental features can often extend over more than one 
segment. 
In the discussion of complex segments in the last 
chapter we saw another counter-example to the SPE 
position of regarding all segments as minimal, unordered 
bundles of features. Not all segments are unordered feature 
bundles. Segments can have internal structure involving the 
linear ordering of some features. That is true of affricates, 
prenasalised consonants and diphthongs (section 9.4.3). 
The same can be demonstrated to be true of contour 
tones. A contour tone is a combination of two more basic 
tones. For example, a falling tone is made up of a high tone 
followed by a low tone, while a rising tone consists of a low 
tone followed by a high tone. 
I shall illustrate this point using data from Gwari 

192 Multi-tiered phonology 
(Nigeria). The source is Hyman (1973). In Gwari there is 
a rule which spreads the tone of the first syllable onto the 
following syllable creating a contour rising tone or falling 
tone:

Even where a contour tone cannot, on the face of it, 
be broken into a sequence of two tones, inspection of its 
phonological behaviour shows that it acts like two consecu-
tive tones. This will be shown by considering the phenom-
enon of DOWNDRIFT which is found in many African 
tone languages. When an underlying high tone is preceded 
by a low tone it is usually automatically lowered and 
becomes phonetically indistinguishable from a mid tone. 
Downdrift is an example of partial assimilation: a high tone 
is somewhat lowered and becomes more like a low tone 
which precedes it: 
[10.8 UR 
"H L H" 
PR 
Thus, in Luganda an underlying high tone preceded by 
another high tone remains high. However, a high tone 
preceded by a low tone or a falling tone gets lowered. The 
later part of a falling tone thus behaves just like a simple 
low tone.

The representation of tone 193 
'They will kill themselves' 
In a theory which insists on regarding segments as 
unordered feature bundles the facts which we have surveyed 
are simply accidental. There is no apparent reason why 
[+low] and [+falling] tones should both trigger off down-
drift. If, however, falling tones are treated in a way anal-
ogous to that proposed for complex segments like affricates 
in section 9.4.3, the reason for the similarity between low 
tones and falling tones becomes obvious. A falling tone, 
even when it is borne by a short vowel, is not an unordered 
bundle of features. It is a sequence of a high tone followed 
by a low tone and naturally it will cause the same pertur-
bations as a simple low tone. In view of this, contour tones 
should be represented as complex tones which have internal 
structure: 
[10.10] [ +high] 
[-high] 
—cons 
+syll 
The implication of this is that the simple slicing hypothesis 
should be replaced with a model that recognises that there 
need not be a one-to-one mapping between elements at 
various levels. As [10.10] shows, the tonal features [+high] 
and [—high] are both simultaneously associated with a 
single vowel. 
However, it is not a free-for-all that is being advocated. 
There are restrictions on the ways in which tones can be 
associated with segments. The theory incorporates the 
OBLIGATORY CONTOUR PRINCIPLE (OCP) which 
prohibits two identical tones from being adjacent (Leben 
J973, 1978). Adjacent identical tones are simplified: 
[10.11]

A rising tone (LH) is simplified to H before a high tone and 
a falling tone (HL) is simplified to low before a low tone.

segment (normally a vowel) is either deleted or becomes 
nonsyllabic and loses its ability to bear tone, the tone still 
survives and surfaces on an adjacent syllable. Tone shows 
a kind of STABILITY which cannot be accounted for if it 
is assumed to be an integral part of the phonological 
segment on which it appears in the phonetic representation. 
Consider the following examples from Margi (Nigeria) 
and see what happens to tone when a vowel is deleted: 
[10.14] Margi (Hoffmann 1963) 
Indefinite 
Definite 
(a) sal 
'man' 
salari 
(b) fa 
'farm' 
fari 
(c) ti 
'mourning' 
tyan 
In [10.14a] when the definite suffix -ari, with its HL tones 

The representation of tone 195 
is added, no phonological process takes place. But in 
[10.14b] when the same suffix is added, one of the vowels 
is deleted so that the phonetic representation is firi and not 
*fidri. Note, however that the underlying LHL tone pattern 
is preserved although that means the LH being squashed on 
to a single vowel. Similarly, in [10.14c], when glide forma-
tion turns an underlying high vowel into a nonsyllabic glide 
incapable of bearing tone, the tone does not disappear. It 
merely gets shunted on to the next syllabic segment. Once 
again the underlying LHL tone pattern is preserved by 
having a rising tone on the first available vowel. 
Normally, when a phonological rule deletes a conson-
ant or vowel it wipes it out in its entirety. The fact that 
tones can survive either the deletion or loss of syllabicity 
of the segments that bear them is further evidence of their 
autonomy. 
Note however, that tone stability is not a universal 
phenomenon. There are many cases where deletion of the 
tone-bearing element spells doom for the tone which it 
carries. This is particularly true of languages where only 
heavy syllables can bear complex contour tones. This is 
because many such languages have a requirement that there 
can only be one-to-one association between tones and tone-
bearing units. We shall return to this point presently. 
10.3.3 Melody levels 
A further type of argument for the autosegmental approach 
is the existence of MELODY LEVELS. There are languages 
where a given pitch configuration is linked to certain 
morphemes or words or grammatical constructions regard-
less of the number of consonant and vowel segments which 
they contain. A classic example of this is Mende (Sierra 
Leone) (Leben 1973, 1978). Most words containing one 
morpheme in this language have the following 
tone 
patterns: H, L, HL, LH and LHL irrespective of the number 
of syllables they contain:

196 Multi-tiered phonology 
Leben suggests that if we regard the tone pattern as phon-
ologically separate from the consonant and vowel segments 
in these words, we can capture the fact that a given melody 
is realised on each class of words regardless of the number 
of segments present. 
To summarise, at the abstract level of lexical represen-
tation, tones do have a separate existence. But at some point 
in a derivation, which differs from one language to the next, 
tone gets segmentalised so that phonetically it is realised as 
a feature of a tone-bearing unit in much the same way as 
segmental properties like [± coronal] or [± back] are. 
10.4 The autosegmental model and the 
representation of tone 
In the last section the arguments in favour of the autoseg-
mental model were presented. How does autosegmental 
phonology differ from SPE phonology? 
The main concerns of autosegmental phonology differ 
from those of SPE. In the SPE model (the spirit of which 
is reflected in the first eight chapters of this book), the main 
preoccupation was with rules that modify feature specifi-
cations in different ways; with the ways in which rules 
mapping underlying onto surface representations interact 
and with the degree to which underlying representations 
may differ from surface representations. 
In autosegmental phonology the focus shifts to ways 
in which phonological rules can change the ORGANIS-
ATION of phonological representations. In autosegmental 
phonology phonological representations are no longer seen 
as simple rows of segments, with all phonological processes 
taking place at one single level. Rather, they are regarded 
as complex arrays of (in principle independent) elements 
arranged on different levels or TIERS. 
Various metaphors can be used to express this insight. 
Phonological representations can be compared to a multi-
storied building, with the syllables as the structural pillars 
and beams which support the weight of different levels of 
the building. In this building various events can take place 
at the different levels (e.g. the stress level, the tonal level, 
etc.) without necessarily having any effect on what goes on 

The autosegmental model and the representation of tone 197 
at another level. The different 
levels, though 
inter-
connected, are in principle autonomous. 
Alternatively, following Morris Halle, we can use the 
analogy of a book with many pages to describe the auto-
segmental model of the organisation of phonology. Imagine 
a book with many pages, with each page standing for a 
different phonological tier. All languages have the conso-
nant and vowel segments page (tier). But there is some 
variation as to what other pages (tiers) are selected by any 
one language. The possibilities include a page each for 
stress, tone, nasalisation and vowel harmony. Whatever 
selection is made, however, the binding or the core that 
makes the various pages of the book hold together is the 
syllable. In the last chapter (which was in effect a practical 
introduction to autosegmental phonology) we saw the 
central role of the syllable in phonology. We are going to 
build on that in this chapter. 
In this model, establishing the principles that govern 
the ways in which elements on different tiers are ASSO-
CIATED becomes a central task of phonology. ASSOCI-
ATION LINES are the apparatus used to LINK elements 
on different tiers. Phonological rules may not only have the 
effect of modifying segments, they may also alter the way 
in which elements on different tiers relate to each other. 
Phonological theory has to establish universal principles of 
association and descriptions of particular languages have to 
show any idiosyncratic aspects of the ways in which associ-
ation between different tiers takes place. 
The notation used in writing rules is presented below:

198 Multi-tiered phonology 
As you can see in the Margi example below, under-
lying tone association may be different from surface associ-
ation. Phonological derivations may involve deleting or re-
drawing association lines. You will also observe that both 
the possibility of a one-to-one MAPPING of tone onto 
tone-bearing units (vowels in this case) and that of a one-
to-many mapping are both envisaged.

It is not expected, given the autonomy of the different 
levels, that every tone will be necessarily associated with a 
tone-bearing unit. Thus, Leben shows that in Mende there 
exist both tone-bearing suffixes like the definite marker —i 
and toneless ones like the post-position -hu 'in'. 
Examine the data in [10.18] and suggest a rule to 
account for the realisation of tone in these Mende suffixes:

In order to represent the underlyingly toneless vowel 
in [10.18], a rule like [10.19] is needed. The V slot starts 
off without being linked to a tone and a rule draws an 
association line linking it to the tone immediately to its left. 
By convention such a linking process is shown by using a 
broken line.

The converse of [10.19] is not only theoretically poss-
ible, it is also a practical reality. Many languages have tones 
which 
are underlyingly 
unlinked 
to any 
tone-bearing 
element. Such tones are referred to as FLOATING tones. 
The word [mbu!i] in [10.18] above contains an example 
of a floating tone. As you can see, the root has an under-
lying falling tone. But when it is followed by the high tone 
of the definite singular suffix, the falling tone (HL) is 
simplified to high (H) (i.e. rlL —» H). After the deletion of 
the low part of the falling tone there should be two high 
tones next to each other and they should have the same high 
pitch in the phonetic representation. The surface represen-
tation should be *[mbui] ( 
). But that is not the case. 
This is because before it is deleted by the tone simplification 
rule, the underlying low tone (the second part of the falling 
tone) brings about the lowering to mid of the high tone of 
the suffix. The correct surface representation has the high 
tone of the suffix -1 lowered so that it is like a mid tone. 
We assume this derivation: 
[10.20] 
UR 
/ m b i f i / 
PR 
[mbu'i] ( - - ) 
D O W N S T E P 
is the name 
given 
to this 
process 
whereby a high tone is lowered in the absence of any 
preceding low tone in the phonetic representation. A down-
stepped high tone is represented by (or !H). 
It is necessary to distinguish between downdrift and 
downstep. Downdrift is automatic lowering induced by the 
presence of a low tone immediately before a high tone in 
the phonetic representation. But downstep is phonetically 

200 Multi-tiered phonology 
nonautomatic lowering. The underlying low tone that 
causes the lowering does not occur in the phonetic repre-
sentation. The nonsurfacing low tone which causes down-
step is referred to as a FLOATING tone. 
Our next example of a floating tone comes from Mbui, 
a language of Cameroon and is borrowed from Hyman and 
Tadadjeu (1976: 61): 
[10.21] 
(a) bakoo 'crabs' 
bandum 'husbands' 
(b) bakoo ba sarj 
'the crabs of the bird' 
bandum !ba sarj 
'the husbands of the bird' 
In isolation both 'crabs' and 'husbands' have L-H tone. 
However, when these words come together in the associ-
ative construction, with high tone [serj] as the second noun, 
the associative marker [ba] is realised with its underlying 
high tone after 'crabs' but is downstepped to 
H 
after 
'husbands'. Since in Mbui, as in many other languages a 
downstepped high (H) only arises when a high tone is 
preceded by a low tone, we can infer that although no low 
tone is actually phonetically present, there is one at the 
underlying level. We can therefore set up these two different 
underlying representations for [10.21]: 
[10.22] a. /bakoo + ba '+ sarj/ 
'the 
crabs 
of 
the 
bird' 
b. /bandum + ba + sarj/ 'the husbands of the 
bird' 
The lexical representation of 'husbands' is given in [10.23] 
where the final low tone of the word is floating (i.e. not 
linked to any tone-bearing segment in the underlying 
representation): 
[10.23] 
L 
H 
©" 
b a n du m 
In Mbui we have recognised a FLOATING LEXICAL 
T O N E tone (i.e. a floating tone that is part of the under-
lying representation of a noun, verb, adjective or adverb). 
This is a somewhat rare phenomenon. Much more common 
are FLOATING GRAMMATICAL T O N E S 2 (i.e. floating 
tones that are part of the representation of grammatical 
morphemes like tense, number, definiteness, possession etc.). 

The autosegmental model and the representation of tone 201 
Study the following data and work out the evidence in 
favour of a floating grammatical tone. Having done that 
show how it could be represented in autosegmental 
notation.

'a child's crab' 
-* [bt5mo] 
'a child's cricket' 
The associative construction is marked with a floating 
high tone which occurs between the nouns. Where as in 
'a child's crab', the first noun ends in a high tone and the 
next noun begins with a high tone, the floating high tone 
cannot be detected. However, where in isolation the two 
nouns in the construction respectively begin and end in a 
low tone, the detection of a floating high tone is easy: it is 
linked to the low tone at the beginning of the second noun. 
The result of the combination of high and low tone on the 
same syllable is a falling tone as in [ameGa] 'water of father'.

In autosegmental phonology, 
given the starting 
assumption of the autonomy of tone, the existence of such 
free, unassociated tones is not surprising. But the same facts 
cause severe embarrassement in a theory of linear phon-
ology where tone features are assumed to be an integral part 
of the segmental representation of tone-bearing units such 
as vowels because the prediction that tone is always a 

202 Multi-tiered phonology 
segmental feature is not borne out by the evidence. The 
existence of floating tones was one of the original arguments 
used to justify autosegmental representations. 
The Etsako data in [10.24] 
a r e 
a l s o interesting for 
another reason. They show that contour falling tones arise 
from underlying sequences of HL which happen to surface 
on the same tone-bearing segment. We shall not labour this 
point as it has already been made above. 
Besides linking tone to tone-bearing units by drawing 
new association lines, rules may also DELINK tones. That 
is to say, the association line between a tone and a tone-
bearing unit can be severed. Thus, in Hausa (Nigeria), an 
underlying rising LH tone is SIMPLIFIED and becomes a 
simple high tone when preceded by a high; the L tone of 
the rise is deleted as you can see in the first example, 
meaning 'I took (unspecified object)': 
[10.26] (a) Hausa (Schuh 1978: 243) 
/naa tfaukaa/ [na: tfauka:] 'I took 
(unspecified object)' 
/naa tfaukee ta/ [na: cfauke: ta] 'I took it' 
(b) /naa tambayaa/ [na: tambaya:] 'I asked 
(unspecified object)' 
/naa tambayee ta/ [na: tambaye: ta] 'I 
asked her' 
The delinking of the association line between the tone 
and the vowel can be formalised as in [10.27] (and as before, 
the broken association line indicates tone spreading (see 
[10.16]) above).

We have now seen the case for a multi-tier approach 
to phonological organisation. But how are the tiers related? 
The principles governing the linking or association of 

The autosegmental model and the representation of tone 203 
elements on different tiers have been articulated in what is 
called the WELL-FORMEDNESS C O N D I T I O N (WFC). 
This convention exists in a number of slightly different 
versions. The version below is based on Goldsmith (1976): 
[10. 28] Well-formedness Condition 
(WFC) 
(i) Each vowel must be associated with at least 
one tone, 
(ii) Each tone must be associated with at least 
one vowel, 
(iii) No association lines may cross. 
This convention lies at the heart of autosegmental 
phonology. It has the effect of adding and deleting associ-
ation lines as appropriate at any point during a derivation. 
Its function is not to police phonological representations; it 
is not a filter that only lets through representations which 
meet certain pre-set criteria; rather, it is to be seen as a state-
ment of the unmarked, neutral, normal state of affairs. 
Aberrations from the unmarked situation are sorted out by 
tone rules. 
The discussion above has implicitly used the WFC. In 
our earlier Mende examples in [10.19], which is repeated 
below as [10.29] for convenience, tone spreads from the first 
syllable of the root to the toneless vowels that follow it so 
that no vowel surfaces without tone: 
[10.29] 
H 
pe le + hu 
-*• [pelehu] 
be le + hu —- [belehu] 
kpakali + hu 
[kpakalihu] 
Likewise, the 
floating 
(unassociated) tone of Etsako in 
[10.25] (repeated below as [10.30]) becomes associated by the 
WFC:

204 Multi-tiered phonology 
The WFC is assumed to be a universal constraint on 
the structure of phonological representations. 
Use the WFC 
to 
perform 
tone mapping 
in 
the 
following example from an imaginary language: 
[10.31] 
H 
L 
ta 
li 
la 
lu 
ku ma 
zi 
sa 
When doing the tone mapping we must remember that 
association lines are not allowed to cross. Obviously, in this 
case that means that the high tone which is linked to -la-
in the underlying representation has to be mapped onto the 
toneless first two syllables of the word and the low tone 
linked to -ma- has to be mapped onto the last two syllables: 
[10.32] 
H 
L 
* 
< 
'

\ 
^» 
_ta 
li 
la 
lu 
ku ma zi 
sa_ 
The problem is determining how tone mapping should 
proceed in the case of the syllables /lu-ku/ which are 
flanked by high and low tone-bearing vowels. They could 
be both high, with tone spreading from left to right; they 
could be both low, with tone spreading from right to left; 
or could acquire the adjacent low and high tones respec-
tively. As it stands, the statement of the WFC in [10.28] is 
not explicit enough to show which of these three alterna-
tives should be chosen. What is needed is a more explicit 
statement of the mapping principles. 
In order to cope with situations like this where the 
requirements of the WFC can in principle be met by imple-
menting a variety of procedures, the following supplemen-
tary principles have been appended to the WFC (Clements 
and Ford 1979; Clements and Goldsmith 1984): 

Tone and intonation 205 
[10.33] 
(i) Associate free tones to free tone-bearing 
units going from left to right, 
(ii) The association of free 
(unassociated) 
segments takes precedence over that of 
already linked (associated) 
segments; 
furthermore, 
(a) 
give 
precedence 
to 
segments linked to unaccented elements, 
if there are any; (b) give precedence to 
segments on the left, 
(iii) Add the minimal number of association 
lines required to undo the violation of the 
WFC. 
Once we adopt [10.33], there is no more ambiguity as 
to which tones should be mapped onto -luku- in [10.32]. The 
second principle of [10.33] states that the association goes 
from left to right. So the high tone is mapped on to luku- :

U

In most cases, applying these principles in this order elim-
inates any uncertainty about the application of the WFC. 
In the remainder of this chapter we shall see how the 
insights into the nature of phonological representations 
gained from the autosegmental study of tone have been 
extended to other aspects of phonology. 
10.5 Tone and intonation 
Sometimes TONE LANGUAGES are contrasted with 
INTONATION LANGUAGES. But they should not be. 
Tone languages also have intonation. One common inton-
ation effect found in many register tone languages is TONE 
TERRACING. Terracing involves several related phenomena: 
DOWNDRIFT, DOWNSTEP and UPSTEP. 
As we saw in (10.3), downdrift refers to the automatic 
lowering of pitch in a PHONOLOGICAL PHRASE when-

206 Multi-tiered phonology 
ever a high tone is preceded by a low tone. A phonological 
phrase is an utterance, often coterminous with the sentence 
at the syntactic level, which can be said in one breath and 
can naturally be followed by a pause. Downdrift creates a 
falling intonation contour in a phonological phrase. Because 
every high tone is lower than the preceding high each time 
there is an intervening low, a phonologically high tone can 
be phonetically lower in pitch than a low tone appearing 
before it in a phonological phrase. Thus downdrift creates 
a 'terracing' effect:

Downdrift only obtains within a phonological phrase. 
Pitch is reset at the beginning of each phonological phrase. 
A Luganda example of downdrift is given in [10.36]. 
[10.36]

J 
l_r 
'we have not seen the/a 
person cultivating

Recall that in our discussion of floating tones we noted 
that that the term D O W N S T E P is used to describe situ-
ations where tone lowering occurs which is not automati-
cally 
triggered 
off 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
a low 
tone 
immediately before a high tone. Sometimes, for no apparent 
surface phonetic reason, a high tone may be lowered (!H) 
when it is preceded by another high tone as in Akan 
(Ghana) (Schachter & Fromkin 1968): 
[10.37] /nil 0 -b'uj (mrbu] 'my stone' 
The noun /5-bu/ contains the vowel /o/ which bears a low 
tone prefix. The vowel is deleted in the possessive construc-
tion following the possessive morpheme /mi/; but the tone 

Tone and intonation 207 
is not. Rather it is left floating. The presence of this floating 
low tone is responsible for the tonal downstep. While the 
phonetic motivation of downdrift is present on the surface, 
that of downstep is not. Yet from the point of view of 
intonation, downstep is similar to downdrift in that it causes 
the pitch of the utterance to go down. 
UPSTEP is the converse of downstep. It is the raising 
of the pitch of a tone so that it is phonetically a step higher 
in pitch than the preceding token of the same tone. Upstep 
produces rising intonation over part of the utterance. 
Cope (1970) reports that in Zulu (South Africa), low 
tones between highs become high and that in a series of 
successive high tones, each high tone is higher than its 
predecessor: 
[1O.38J 
'the boys who do not want it' 
[-
-J 
/abafana abayifuni/ 
—•- 
[abafana 
ibayifuni] 
While in Zulu a high tone is raised if preceded by 
another high tone, creating a crescendo effect, in Engenni 
(Nigeria) (Thomas 1974), there is automatic upstepping of 
a high when it is followed by a low in the same phonol-
ogical phrase: 
[10.39] 
'I saw you' 
'I did see you' 
L->—: 
m 1 mom wo 
1_ 
WD bh e 
Sometimes intonation contours are associated with 
particular sentence types. In many languages falling inton-
ation (due to downdrift) is associated with declarative 
sentences while rising intonation resulting from a mitigation 
or total undoing of the effects of downdrift is associated 
with interrogative sentences. 
Thus in Hausa in questions downdrift is suspended 
towards the end of the phonological phrase. The last high 
tone is upstepped and acquires extra-high pitch with a sharp 
fall (Hombert 1974 cited in Schuh 1978):

10.6 Pitch-accent 
The impression might have been given that all languages 
are either tone languages or stress languages. The reality is 
somewhat more complex. Some languages are not clearly 
one thing or the other. A classic example of a language that 
does not fit neatly into either category is Japanese. 
In Japanese pitch is used contrastively as in a tone 
language. But it is subject to the constraint that there can 
only be one pitch drop per word. Pitch can go up or 
down only once in a word. An illustration of this is given 
in [10.42] below. You will observe that there are only four 
basic melodies: L, HL, LH and LHL:

As you can see, all the syllables of the nouns in (a) are

the rest of the examples, however there is a pitch change. 
An abstract ACCENT, which is represented by an asterisk

occurs:

A specified starred high toned syllable is 
flanked by low toned syllables. Low is the 
DEFAULT or neutral tone assigned when 
there is no instruction (in the form of an 
asterisk) to assign a high tone. 
Japanese is called a PITCH ACCENT language. It 
shares some of the characteristics of both 
STRESS 
languages like English (which are the subject of the next 
chapter) and those of tone languages like Chinese. 
On the one hand, in Japanese pitch functions in much 
the same way as stress does in English. Words in a stress 
language are not allowed to have more than one peak of 
prominence (in English it is not possible to place two main 
stresses on a word like * disinformation). Similarly, in a pitch 
accent language there can be at most one peak of promi-
nence in a word. A Japanese word can have only one of the 
following patterns: L, H, HL, LH or LHL [see [10.42]. 
High tones cannot alternate with low tones. 
On the other hand, however, Japanese is like a true 
tone language in that pitch contrasts are used phonemically. 
In this it differs from a stress language like English which 
does not have minimal pairs distinguished by pitch differ-
ences alone. 

Vowel harmony 211 
Study [10.42] and identify words distinguished by pitch 
differences. 
The following are minimal pairs distinguished by pitch: 
na (L) 'name' 
na (H) 'vegetable' 
kaki (L) 'persimmon' 
kaki (LH) 'fence' 
10.7 Vowel harmony 
Vowel harmony is a process whereby within a certain 
designated domain, usually the word, all vowels are 
required to share one or more phonological properties. The 
vowels of a language are divided into two mutually 
exclusive sets and all vowels within a stipulated domain 
must be, say, either front or back, high or low, rounded 
or unrounded, etc. Thus, in classical Mongolian all the 
vowels in a word are either front as in [kobegyn] 'son, boy' 
and [kotelbyri] 'instruction' or alternatively, they are all 
back as in [uyuta] 'bag' (Lightner 1965). 
Welmers (1973:34) reports that in Igbo (Nigeria), 
vowels belong to either set A, which is [ + ATR] or set B, 
which is [-ATR]. Normally, all the vowels used in a word 
come from just one of these two sets: 
[10.47] Set^A: [i e u o] 
Set B: [1 a u 0] 
6 riri 'he ate' 
6 piri 'he carved' 
6 mere 'he did' 
5 sara 'he washed' 
6 gburu 'he killed' 
6 zuru 'he bought' 
6 zoro 'he did' 
5 doro 'he pulled' 
Vowel harmony differs in a significant way from arche-
typical suprasegmental properties like tone and stress. While 
these are always located on a separate tier from that where 
vowels and consonants are found, harmonising phonolog-
ical features like [back], [round], [high] and [ATR] are 
normally part of the segmental representation of individual 
vowels. But they are extracted from the segmental tier and 
are placed on a distinct harmony tier and cease functioning 

212 Multi-tiered phonology 
as properties of individual segments. But when vowel 
harmony occurs, they are extracted from the segmental tier 
and cease functioning as properties of individual segments: 
they SPREAD to all vowels within a specified domain. This 
domain is usually the word. 
Vowel harmony constitutes a theoretically fascinating 
phenomenon which can throw light on the nature of phon-
ological representations because of the way in which it func-
tions partly as a segmental and partly as a suprasegmental 
property. 
Vowel harmony can be described in the framework of 
autosegmental phonology by using these principles: 
[10.48] 
(i) identify the set of harmonising 
features 
which are suprasegmentalised and placed 
on a separate tier; 
(ii) identify 
the class of elements 
(vowels) 
which bear the harmonising feature; 
(iii) identify 
the 
set 
(possibly 
empty) 
of 
O P A Q U E SEGMENTS. Opaque segments 
are vowels which ought to obey the vowel 
harmony rules but fail to do so because 
they are specified in the lexicon for the 
harmonising 
feature 
and 
are 
therefore 
exempt from vowel harmony rules which 
fill in blanks for the harmonising feature 
during a derivation; 
(iv) mutatis mutandis, harmonising features are 
associated with vowels in accordance with 
the requirements of the WFC [10.28,10.33] 
In [10.49] these principles are used in the mapping of 
the feature [ATR] in the derivation of the Igbo forms in 
[10.47]: 
[10.49] 
(a) 
Vowel harmony tier 
[ + ATR] 
Segmental tier 
O 
zOrO 
—• [o zoro] 'he did' 
(b) 
Vowel harmony tier 
[ — ATR] 
Segmental tier 
O 
dOrO 
-*• [odoro] 'he pulled' 

Vowel harmony 213 
Note: Capital letters are used in underlying representations 
for vowels specified for all features except the 
harmonising feature, in this case, [ATR]. 
Attempt writing an autosegmental rule for the Mongo-
lian example [kobegyn] 'boy, son' which we referred to 
earlier. 
For Mongolian, the feature back is the one that is 
placed on the vowel harmony tier. A rule like [10.50] is 
needed: 
[10.50] 
Vowel harmony tier: 
Segmental tier: 
[-back] 
" 
/ 
1 \ 
kO 
bEgUn_ —•- kobegyn 
Now write a rule to account for the Akan vowel 
harmony data in [10.51] which are borrowed from Clem-
ents (1985): 
[10.51] (a) All vowels are [+ ATR] 
[o-fiti-i] 'he pierced (it)' 
(b) All vowels are [- 
ATR] 
[0 -are -1] 'he showed (it)' 
Your rule should be like [10.52]: 
[10.52] 
(a) r 
H+ATR] 
>fr 
1 
! * •*

— [ofitii] 
(b) R - A T R ] 
" 
/ 
I 
\ 
x v 
O-cI rE - I — [ocirei] 
Unfortunately for the phonologist, all Akan forms are 
not so well behaved. There are words which have a mixture 
of vowels from the two harmonising sets. That is the case 
in [o-jiinsejii-i] 'she became pregnant'. This is an instance 
of OPAQUE ASSOCIATION, i.e. some of the vowels are 
linked to harmonising features in the underlying represen-
tation. The infinitive form of this verb is: 

214 Multi-tiered phonology 
[io.53]

'to become pregnant' 
The derivation of [o-jiinseni-i] proceeds as in [10.54]: 
[+ATR]

Vowel harmony is of theoretical interest because of 
what it reveals of the 'slicing' phenomenon. A phonological 
parameter may be selected for different degrees of supra-
segmentalisation: it may be put on an entirely separate tier, 
like stress or tone in many languages; or it may be only 
partially suprasegmentalised, like vowel harmony in those 
languages where certain features are sometimes put on a 
separate tier and sometimes treated as an integral part of 
vowel phonemes. 
10.8 Nasalisation 
Like vowel harmony, NASALITY, is another phonological 
parameter that can be suprasegmentalised. Normally, the 
specification [+nasal] is an integral part of nasal consonants 
(and possibly nasal vowels). However, in some languages 
this feature is extracted from the segmental tier and placed 
on the suprasegmental tier so that it characterises several 
syllables or morphemes or even entire words. 
Desano, a Colombian language of the Amazon basin, 
is a standard example of a language which treats nasalisation 
as a suprasegmental element. Native Desano words consist 
of morphemes which are either all oral or all nasal: 
[10.55] Desano (Kaye 1971) 
nasal 
[wai] 
'name' 
[nohso] 
'kind of bird' 
[senanu] 
[mininul] 
'pineapple' 
'a small 
round 
thing' 
oral 
[wai] 'fish' 
[johso] 
'kind 
of 
lizard' 
[goru] 'ball' 
[wyariru] 'a large 
round thing' 

Nasalisation 215 
The voiceless segments /p t k s h/ are NEUTRAL. They 
are neither capable of bearing the property of nasalisation, 
nor of inhibiting its spread. They are are 'invisible' to the 
nasalisation rule. But voiced segments are all capable of 
bearing nasalisation: they have both oral and nasalised 
versions: 
[10.56] 
Oral 
Nasal 
V 
b 
d/r 
g 
J 
w 
V 
m 
n 
0 
Ji 
w 
In Desano, nasalisation is not simply a property of 
certain consonants. It is extracted from the segmental tier 
and placed on a separate suprasegmental tier. To represent 
the Desano situation rules like [10.57] a re needed: 
[10.57] 
[ +nasal] 
/ 1 N 
/ ! \ 
_w a i _ -*• [wai] 
[ — nasal] 
I 1 \ 
/ 
1 \ 
/ > \ 
_ w a i __ 
Where there are neutral voiceless consonants, the mapping 
proceeds in the same way, only this time being blind to the 
presence of voiceless consonants: 
[10.58] 
[ +nasal] 
/! \ 
johso 
—"-jiohso 
In the discussion of both vowel harmony and nasalis-
ation I have used the concept of SPREADING. Originally 
spreading was seen as a unique property of tone. In recent 
years, however, it has been suggested by a number of 
linguists (Steriade 1982; Hayes 1986; Archangcli and Pulley-
blank 1986; Hyman and Pulleyblank 1987) that all assimi-
lation 
should 
be treated 
as spreading. 
That 
includes 

216 Multi-tiered phonology 
processes like voice assimilation, palatalisation and place of 
articulation assimilation which were dealt with by feature 
copying rules in the past. This is in conformity with the 
view of speech outlined in Chapter 4. 
10.9 Morphemic tier 
Students of Semitic morphology have extended the theory 
of autosegmental phonology in other directions. McCarthy 
(1979, 1981) has proposed the setting up of a morphemic 
tier for languages like Arabic and Hebrew. Usually in a 
Semitic language words are formed by adding vowels to a 
SKELETON root which consists of three consonants. 
Thus, in Egyptian Arabic the root meaning 'write' is 
ktb, and the root meaning 'understand' is Jhm. Various 
word-forms are derived by adding vowels (and in some 
cases consonants) to these skeletal consonantal roots: 
[10.59] (a) katab 
'he wrote' fihim 
'he 
understood' 
(b) katbu 
'they wrote' fihmu 
'they 
understood' 
(c) kattib 
'he caused fahhim 
'caused to 
to write' 
understand' 
(i.e. he 
explained) 
McCarthy's proposal is that the verb is made up of co-
existent representations on three separate tiers. There is a 
CV-SKELETON which is the consonantal root. Two other 
tiers are linked to this: a consonantal tier and a vowel tier 
containing the vowel pattern of the word which is mapped 
in a manner reminiscent of tone melodies in Mende.

Morphemic tier 217 
Now provide a derivation similar to [10.60] for katab, katbu 
and kattib. 
Your solution should be essentially the same as that given 
in [10.52] except for the root consonants which in this case 
are ktb instead offlim. 
We have seen that Arabic regular verbs have a tricon-
sonantal root to which various vowel melodies are added, 
depending on the grammatical form required. Interestingly, 
wherever there are more slots for C or V segments on the 
skeletal tier than there are vowels or consonants on the 
vowel or consonant tier, a phenomenon akin to tone 
spreading takes place. A single vowel or consonant is linked 
to two C or V slots as is required by the WFC. Such a 
segment is realised as geminate in the phonetic representa-
tion (section 9.4.3). 
Thus notions of nonlinear phonology, 
originally 
proposed in order to deal with tone, turn out to make 
correct predictions for totally unrelated phenomena like 
vowel harmony, nasalisation and Semitic concatenative 
(infixing) morphology. This has encouraged linguists to 
believe that significant principles of linguistic organisation 
have been unearthed. 
In the next chapter we shall consider another non-linear 
approach to phonology which has been very successful in 
the analysis of stress and is inspired by principles similar to 
those of autosegmental phonology.

Kombe (based on Elimelech 1976) 
In Kombe, a Bantu language spoken in Rio Muni 
(Equitorial Guinea) there are only two underlying 
phonemic tone oppositions, namely high and low. But 
five phonetic tones occur phonetically. Thus nouns in 
isolation exhibit the following 
five tones in the 
phonetic representation: 
H 
(high) 
[V] 
[-] 
L 
(low) 
[V] 
[ J 
L° (unreleased low) 
[V°] 
[-] 
F 
(falling) 
[y] 
p] 
D downstep high 
[V] 
[—] 
In the examples in (a) below the tones L, L°, D and F 
are shown on the final syllable of nouns: 
(a) ta6a

It is interesting to note that nouns in isolation never end 
on a high tone,

Notes 
Firthian prosodic analysis rejects the 
structuralist 
phonemicist's position presented here. Prosodic analysis 
assumes a more complex view of phonological struc-
ture. Phonological representations are said to consist of 
PHONEMATIC 
UNITS 
(roughly equivalent 
to 
consonants and vowels) and PROSODIES like tone, 
stress, 
vowel 
harmony, 
voicing 
and 
nasalisation 
(Palmer 1970). 
Where a floating tone does surface in some realisations 
of a morpheme (as is the case in the Mende example 

220 Multi-tiered phonology 
in [10.19]), the idea of floating tones is not very contro-
versial. However, there is considerable disagreement as 
to whether it is justifiable to posit an abstract floating 
tone (which never surfaces anywhere phonetically) the 
existence of which can only be detected from the tonal 
perturbations which it causes. 
The analysis of the Etsako associative marker as 
a floating high tone is an example of an abstract floating 
tone. The validity of this analysis is disputed by those 
who object to underlying representations which are 
distant from phonetic representations. The essence of 
the criticism is similar to that made against abstract 
segments at the level of segmental phonology (see 
section 8.2). Critics of very abstract underlying repre-
sentations would prefer to interpret problematic tonal 
alternations like that in Etsako in terms of lexical or 
grammatical conditioning. They would argue, for 
instance, that instead of a rule like [10.25] the grammar 
of Etsako should contain a statement to the effect that 
the associative marker conditions the change of a low 
tone into a falling tone on the first syllable of the 
second noun in an associative construction if that noun 
begins with a low tone. 

CHAPTER 11 
Stress and intonation 
11.1 Introduction: stress 
This chapter is in two sections. The first section introduces 
you to the description of STRESS using a non-linear 
approach known as METRICAL PHONOLOGY. The 
second part is devoted to intonation. 
11.1.1 What is stress? 
Linguists have an intuitive understanding of the phonetic 
properties of stress although they find formulating a precise 
description of these properties problematic. 
Stress is 
primarily a matter of greater AUDITORY 
PROMI-
NENCE. It is essentially a perceptual phenomenon, with 
ill-defined articulatory correlates. An element that is stressed 
is highlighted so that it becomes auditorily more salient than 
the rest of the elements in the string of which it is a part. 
The main phonetic ingredients of stress are PITCH, 
LENGTH and LOUDNESS. Stressed syllables tend to have 
higher pitch and longer duration than their non-stressed 
counterparts. In addition, they may be somewhat louder 
than unstressed syllables; but loudness is a much less 
important parameter than pitch or length. There may be 
also increased respiratory energy in the production of a 
stressed syllable although this is by no means essential. 
Additionally, in some languages, vowels in stressed syl-
lables have clear or full vowel quality while vowels in 
unstressed syllables are reduced and have a somewhat 
'muffled' quality like that of schwa (/a/) in English. The 
phonetic properties of stress will not be explored in this 
book. Rather it is the phonological properties that will be 
investigated. 

222 Stress and intonation 
From a phonological angle, several different kinds of 
stress can be recognised. One kind is WORD STRESS. In 
English, for instance, every lexical item is entered in the 
dictionary with word stress. A particular syllable of a word 
is pronounced in a way that makes it more prominent than 
the rest. If you say words like mother, better, cotton and pity, 
you will notice that the first syllable in all these words is 
much more salient than the second. The first syllable is said 
to be stressed and the second one unstressed. 
In longer words, there is often not just one stressed 
syllable and a host of unstressed ones. Besides the syllable 
that receives the main or primary stress, there are other 
syllables which receive secondary stress. Such syllables are 
more prominent than the weakest syllables of the word. 
If you say the word radiator very carefully, you will 
notice that the first syllable receives primary stress and that 
the third syllable has secondary stress; it is more prominent 
than the second and fourth, though not as prominent as the 
first. Trager and Smith (1951) introduced the convention of 
recognising four levels of stress in English, marked as ' * ' " to 
indicate decreasing order of prominence. 
The authors of SPE continue this tradition. Their view 
is that at least five degrees of stress can be easily detected 
in English. They use the integers 1-4 to mark stress, with 
1 as the strongest and 4 the weakest stress. They suggest 
that unstressed syllables i.e. [-stress] are 'representable as 
[5 stress] in this case' (SPE, page 116). In practice, for 
convenience, unstressed syllables are not assigned any 
integer, as you can see from the examples below which are 
taken from SPE:

The analysis of English stress presented in [11.2b] 
might give the impression that stress is a matter of absolute 
prominence attached to each syllable and that it can be 
indicated by unambiguously 
placing the appropriate 
diacritic on the syllable in question. Disputes, to a large 
extent sterile, have arisen in the past as to the precise 
number of degrees of stress which a language like English 
has. Are all the weak syllables left unmarked (which could 
be assigned degree 5 of stress) equal in prominence? For 
instance, is the final syllable of chemistry not somewhat more 
salient than the middle one? And, furthermore, is the final 
syllable of chemistry not stronger than the last syllable of 
3 1 
1
3 
water? And are the the vowels of equality and indemnify 
which are given degree 3 of stress equal in prominence? 
Reaching agreement on the exact number of degrees of 
stress has turned out to be almost impossible. The problem 
is that the syllable that is most heavily stressed in a word 
(and is therefore assigned degree 1 of stress) is easy to ident-
ify. But there is often some uncertainty as to the degree 
of stress of the less heavily stressed syllables. It is difficult 

224 Stress and intonation 
to determine whether or not a given non-primary stress is 
equivalent to some other non-primary stress in prominence. 
Fortunately, research has shifted in a more fruitful 
direction in recent years. Following Liberman and Prince 
(1977) many linguists today recognise that a theory of stress 
must take on board the fact that prominence is a 
RELATIONAL concept. What matters is that a stressed 
syllable is more salient than its unstressed counterparts. 
Examine some familiar noun-verb pairs in [11.3] which 
are distinguished by stress.

Add three examples of your own to the list in [11.3]. 
Underline the syllable that receives primary stress in each 
example in [11.3]. 
One of the things which these data show is that stress 
is not an integral part of a vowel. In many disyllabic words 
in English the location of stress depends on whether the 
word appears as a noun or as a verb: stress falls on the first 
syllable when the word is used as a noun and on the second 
when it is used as a verb. This shows in a simple way that 
stress is an autosegmental property of the entire word. 
The words in [11.3] are in no way extraordinary. There 
are numerous examples of English words in which stress 
shows a considerable degree of mobility. Say the following, 
noting the syllable with the main or primary stress: 
[11.4] (a) nation national nationalist nationalise 
(b) nationality nationalistic nationalisation 
Underline the syllable which receives the main stress on 
each occasion. 

Introduction: stress 225 
This should be enough to convince you that stress is 
not an inherent property of any vowel. In [11.4a] the first 
syllable receives the main stress regardless of the presence 
or absence of suffixes. But when certain suffixes are present, 
as in [11.4b] stress shifts from the first syllable to the 
syllable immediately preceding the suffix. Stress is not an 
inherent vowel feature. It is an autosegmental property of 
the word. Its location in the phonetic representation of a 
word may depend on the presence of certain affixes or 
grammatical information such as whether the word is real-
ised as a noun or as a verb. 
11.1.2 Metrical phonology 
METRICAL PHONOLOGY is an approach developed 
within the generative phonology framework in recent years 
to handle stress phenomena. It complements AUTOSEG-
MENTAL PHONOLOGY which, as we saw in the last 
chapter, was primarily designed for the description of tone 
although it was used later to account for other aspects of 
phonology. 
We have seen that stress is a relational concept: a 
stressed syllable is more prominent than an unstressed one. 
This fact is regarded as crucial in metrical phonology. Rela-
tive prominence is expressed using BINARY BRANCHING 
TREES, which are labelled STRONG (s) and WEAK (w). 
The more prominent syllable is dominated by s (i.e. it lies 
below s on the tree) and the less prominent one is domi-
nated by w.

Strong and weak syllables are paired together by a 
procedure called FOOT FORMATION. What is proposed 

226 Stress and intonation 
is that stress is assigned to strings which have constituent 
structure consisting of two elements, one of which is strong 
(i.e. dominant) and the other weak (i.e. subordinate). The 
dominant one is the HEAD. The head governs its 
immediate neighbour to the left or right. In [11.5] a number 
of metrical feet are exemplified, with the head coming first 
or second. 
The structure of metrical feet plays an important role 
in English poetry. Find examples of poems where right-
headed and left-headed metrical feet are used. What are the 
literary terms for these feet? 
This short passage from Shakespeare illustrates right-
headed metrical feet: 
He can | not live, | I hope, [ and must | not die 
Till George | be pack'd | with post-| horse up | to heaven. 
I'll, in, I to urge | his hat [ r£d more | to Clarence 
With lies | well steel'd | with weigh | ty ar | guments . . . 
(William Shakespeare Richard HI, I.I. 145-8) 
(Note: V indicates a weak syllable and V a strong 
syllable.) 
The above lines of blank (i.e. non-rhyming) verse typically 
contain five feet. Each foot in turn tends to contain an 
unstressed (weak) syllable which is followed by a stressed 
(strong) one. As you will recall from the discussion of Latin 
metre in (9.5) this pattern is called IAMBIC METRE. (To 
be precise, this extract is written in IAMBIC PENTA-
METRE i.e. there are five feet in each line.) 
A variety of left-headed feet were introduced in our 
brief account of Latin metre in (9.5). Examine an English 
example of left-headed metrical feet where a stressed 
syllable is followed by an unstressed one. As in Latin verse, 
this verse pattern is called TROCHAIC METRE: 
How the" I Chimney | sweeper's | cry 
Every | blackn'ing | Church ap | pals; 
And the | hapless | soldier's | sigh 
Runs in | blood down | Palace f walls. 
(From William Blake London, Songs of experience) 

Introduction: stress 227 
The account of relative prominence given in [i 1.5] only 
deals with disyllabic words. Initially, I was careful to avoid 
longer words for clarity's sake. But in fact, such words can 
be comfortably handled by assuming that phonological 
systems are HIERARCHICAL and that the concept of rela-
tive prominence is applicable at various points in the hier-
archy. The rank which we considered in [115] is that of 
the FOOT. Adjacent syllables were grouped together and 
one of them was identified as being more salient than its 
neighbour. Where a word contains more than two syllables, 
the same manoeuvre can be repeated, with adjacent feet 
being grouped together in order to establish which one of 
them is more salient. Consider 
[11.6] 
s 
s 
w 
s 
w 
w 
sen 
si 
ti 
vi 
ty 
This procedure is known as WORD-TREE FORMATION. 
We can identify the antepenultimate syllable -ti- as the one 
receiving primary stress. By inspecting the tree, we can 
establish that it is dominated by more s's than any other 
syllable. Degrees of stress are read off the tree by counting 
the number of s nodes that dominate a particular syllable: 
the more s nodes there are above a syllable in the tree, the 
more heavily stressed that syllable is. 
Unfortunately, the model just outlined does not always 
yield the correct results. It fails to capture some prominence 
distinctions in English. For instance, it would lead us to 
construct the following trees for radio, rabbi, racer and racy: 
[11.7] (a) 
(b) 
s 
w 
s 
w 
ra 
dio 
ra 
bbi

The trees in [11.7] are identical. But we know that the final 
syllable of the words in [11.7a] is more prominent than the 
final syllable of the words in [11.7b]. To solve this problem, 
Liberman and Prince (1977) proposed the retention of the 
SPE segmental feature [± stress] in their metrical theory of 
stress. If that is done, [11.7] can be re-written as [11.8], 
bringing out clearly the differences in the relative promi-
nence of the final vowel: 
[11.8] (a) 
(b) 
(Here + stands for [+stress] and - stand for [—stress]) 
There is some understandable unease about a metrical, 
nonsegmetal theory of stress which sets out to show the 
relational nature of stress allowing binary segmental feature 
[±stress] to play a role in metrical trees. A simpler way of 
showing the relative salience of syllables which overcomes 
this problem is proposed by Prince (1983). He advocates the 
construction of a METRICAL GRID. This is done by 
representing information of the kind contained in a metrical 
tree as an array of asterisks. One asterisk is assigned to each 
syllable at the syllable tier, an additional asterisk is assigned 
to the stronger syllable in each foot, and if necessary, at 
word level a further asterisk is assigned to the strongest foot 
which is nearest the beginning or the end of the word, 
depending on the preference of a particular language. 
Using a grid we can show in a transparent way the 
relative stress of the different syllables of sensitivity as in

Introduction: stress 229 
Although trees and grids can convey the same infor-
mation, grids are preferable because they do so in a more 
perspicuous manner. 
Convert the metrical trees in [i 1.5] into metrical grids. 
11.1.3 Metrical trees and grids 
If you cast your eye back to [11.5], you will observe that 
in words like sender the left syllable is stronger than the right 
one in the same foot while in a word like pretend the right-
hand syllable is the stronger of the two. Trees like those in 
[11.5] where one syllable functions as the HEAD and 
governs the syllable that immediately precedes or follows 
it are said to be BOUNDED. 
In addition to bounded trees, there exist 
UN-
BOUNDED trees where a head governs not just one ad-
jacent syllable, but all the syllables that precede or follow 
it. This is the situation in a language where primary stress 
always falls either on the initial or final syllable of a word. 
Hayes (1981) provides a typological classification of 
metrical systems. He shows that in some languages, such 
as Maranungku (Australia), primary stress falls on the first 
syllable, and secondary stress on alternate syllables to its 
tiralk 
'saliva' 
right: 
[11.10] 
merepet 
'beard' 
yangarmata 
langkarateti 
welepenemanta 
'the Pleiades' 
'prawn' 
'kind of duck' 
An unbounded tree with a dominant left node [11.11] is 
needed to describe the facts of Maranungku: 
[n-ii] (a) 
s 
w 
ti 
ralk 

230 Stress and intonation 
Contrasting with a language of this kind, are languages 
like French which have unbounded trees with a dominant 
right node. In French stress falls on the last syllable of a 
word: 
[11.12] petit 'little' 
encoura^er 'encourage' 
telecommunication 'telecommunication' 
Draw a bounded tree to represent stress in French 
telecommunication. 
The tree required is [11.13]

The head is on the right and it can have an indefinite 
number of subordinate syllables preceding it. 
Maranungku and French are not unusual. In many 
languages, primary stress falls at or near the periphery of 
a word. Metrical grid theory reflects this fact by incorpor-
ating the END RULE convention. This convention is 
responsible for the addition of extra salience (shown by an 
extra asterisk on a metrical grid) to the most prominent left-
hand or right-hand column of a word, depending on 
whether a language favours the beginning or the end of the 
word as the locus of primary stress. 
In Maranungku where the left-hand edge of the word 
is dominant, the first syllable is assigned an extra asterisk 
by the end rule:

In Weri (Papua-New Guinea) (Hayes 1981) the situation is 
reversed. The final syllable is dominant and alternating 
secondary stress is put on the syllables preceding it jjJka

11.1.4 Extrametricality 
In some languages, such as Finnish and Hungarian, prirnlj^ 
stress normally falls on the initial syllable while in other" 
langauges, such as Cambodian and Modern Hebrew, it is 
the final syllable that gets primary stress. In systems of this 
kind all syllables are taken into account in deciding where 
to put stress. 
However, in many other languages syllables at word 
fringes are ignored by stress assignment rules. Such syllables 
are said to be EXTRAMETRICAL. They are completely 
'invisible' to the rules which assign stress (see extrasylla-
bicity in (9.7)). The concept of extrametricality is useful in 
the treatment of languages which have their main stress on 
the PENULTIMATE syllable of the word. In these 
languages, the last syllable is 'not seen' by the algorithm 
which proceeds to put stress on the second last syllable. 
Swahili is a typical example of such a language (the extra-
metrical final syllable is put in parentheses): 
[ 11.16] pi(ga) 
'hit, beat' 
piga(na) 
'fight, hit each other' 
pigzni(sha) 
'cause to fight' 
tutawapi({><j) 
'we shall beat them' 
While in Swahili, which has penultimate main stress, it is 
the final syllable of a word that is extrametrical, in Native 
American languages like Dakota, Northern Paiute and 
Southern Paiute, where main stress falls on the second 
syllable of the word, it is the first syllable that is 
extrametrical. 

232 Stress and intonation 
11.1.5 Quantity sensitivity 
We have seen above some of the typological parameters 
used in the study of stress: languages may have bounded as 
opposed to unbounded trees; the left or the right end of the 
word may be dominant; either all syllables in a word may 
be taken into account by stress placement rules or some of 
them may be extrametrical. Typological considerations of 
this kind are important 
because linguistic theory is 
concerned not only with the description of particular 
languages, but also with an exploration of the parameters 
within which languages can differ. For, as I have stressed 
at various points in the book, differences between languages 
occur within certain pre-set limits. 
In this section we are going to examine a further typo-
logical parameter, namely whether stress placement in a 
given language is sensitive to the internal structure of the 
syllable that bears it. In particular we shall consider the role 
of SYLLABLE WEIGHT in stress placement. In the exam-
ples discussed above, no mention was made of syllable 
weight because in the languages which were cited, the 
internal structure of syllables is not taken into account in 
determining where to put stress. Syllables are treated in the 
same way irrespective of whether they are light or heavy. 
The languages described in the last few paragraphs have 
SYLLABLE QUANTITY INSENSITIVE STRESS RULES. 
You will recall that we broached the subject of SYLLABLE 
QUANTITY SENSITIVE STRESS rules when examining 
Latin syllable structure in Chapter 9. Like the Swahili rule, 
the Latin stress rule treats the last syllable as extrametrical, 
and ignores it. But there the resemblance ends. While the 
Swahili rule puts primary stress on any penultimate syllable, 
the Latin rule is choosy. It puts stress on a penultimate 
syllable only if it has got a branching rhyme (i.e. it has 
either a long vowel or is closed by a consonant). The Latin 
stress rule can be re-stated as [11.17]: 
[11.17] 
(i) ignore the final syllable: it is extrametrical; 
(ii) construct an unbounded right-headed tree; 
(iii) put primary stress on the first heavy 
syllable at the right-hand side of the word 
if it is in penultimate position (excluding 
the final syllable which is extrametrical); 

Introduction: stress 233 
(iv) if the penultimate syllable is light, put 
primary stress on the ante-penultimate 
syllable. 
Use [11.17] to predict the syllable which gets primary stress 
in [11.18]: 
[11.18] (a) amo 
(b) amamus 
(c) amabamus 
(d) amabimus 
(e) amaveras 
(f) amabantur 
I love' 
we love' 
we loved' 
we shall love' 
you had loved' 
they will be loved' 
Your solution should be along these lines (V indicates 
primary stress): 
[11.19] (a) a(mo) 
Since the final syllable is always extrametri-
cal and therefore irrelevant for stress place-
ment purposes, in disyllabic words primary 
stress must be on the first syllable regardless 
of its structure. 
(b) ama(mus) 
The penultimate syllable contains a long 
vowel and therefore counts as heavy. It 
receives the stress. 
(c) amaba(mus) 
The penultimate syllable is stressed again 
because it is heavy. 
(d) amabi(mus) 
The penultimate syllable only has a short 
vowel in the rhyme; it is light. Stress 
skips it and lands on the ante-penultimate. 
(e) amave(ras) 
The statement made for (d) above covers 
this. 
(f) amaban(tur) 
The penultimate syllable has a branching 
rhyme consisting of a vowel followed by 
a consonant. It is heavy. It receives the 
stress. 

234 Stress and intonation 
11.1.6 English stress 
I shall now illustrate the theory of metrical phonology by 
sketching an outline description of aspects of stress in 
English. The stress system of English is extremely complex. 
Here I can only give you a flavour of a metrical analysis of 
the system. To come to grips with the intricacies of English 
stress, you will need to study the words cited in the 
bibliography.1 
As a rule, unless they are long or complex, grammati-
cal words like prepositions and conjunctions do not receive 
primary word stress. (But long grammatical words, e.g. the 
preposition underneath and the conjunction 
notwithstanding 
receive primary word stress.) All lexical words, i.e. nouns, 
adjectives, verbs and adverbs must have one syllable which 
receives primary stress; obviously, in monosyllabic words 
like dog, look and bag, the only syllable that there is must 
be stressed. Word stress rules are needed in the grammar 
to account for the location of stress in words of two or 
more syllables. Only one syllable receives primary stress 
and the rest are subordinated to that syllable. 
First consider stress placement in a few disyllabic verbs: 
[ 11.20] (a) order 
ferry cover 
carry 
dither copy 
(b) open 
lollop hiccup 
lavish 
covet 
pocket 
[n.21] (a) compare delay endow enjoy 
survey prefer 
(b) corrode 
avoid refine 
design amuse presume 
(c) concoct enlist protect attend 
assent announce 
Suggest a rule (or rules) to account for the placement of 
primary stress in these words. 
Your rule needs to be quantity sensitive. It must make 
crucial reference to syllable weight. What is needed is an 
algorithm which constructs a right-headed bounded tree 
over the word and places main stress on the first heavy 
syllable, counting from the right-hand end of the word. 
Where disyllabic verbs contain no heavy syllables, stress 
falls by default on the first syllable. But otherwise stress falls 
on the right-handmost heavy syllable. 

Introduction: stress 235 
Thus, in [11.20a] there is no heavy syllable. So, 
primary stress falls by default on the first syllable in words 
like copy and ferry. In [i 1.20b] the second syllable contains 
a short vowel and a consonant. On the face of it, the second 
syllable should count as heavy. But it does not. This is 
because the last consonant of a verb is extrametrical, i.e. it 
is 'not seen' by stress rules. A word like lavish [laevi(J")] is 
only scanned up to the vowel [1]. Consequently its final 
syllable is classed as light and primary stress goes on the 
first syllable. 
In [11.21 a], on the other hand, in each case the second 
syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong. This makes it 
heavy and capable of bearing primary stress. In [11.21b] too 
the final consonant is extrametrical but this does not prevent 
primary stress falling on the second syllable. This is because 
the part of the syllable that is seen contains a long vowel 
or diphthong (see avoid [avoi(d)]). Finally, in [11.21c] stress 
once more falls on the second syllable. In these words the 
second syllable has two consonants following the vowel. 
Even though the last consonant is extrametrical, it is the 
second syllable which is nevertheless stressed. This is due 
to the fact that the part of that syllable which is 'seen' by 
the stress rule counts as heavy because it contains a short 
vowel followed by a consonant (see enlist [enlis(t)]). 
Note in passing, however, that the rule stated above 
is not exceptionless. Words ending in [au] (like follow and 
sorrow) are stressed on the first syllable although the second 
syllable contains a diphthong and 'ought to be' regarded as 
heavy. 
Disyllabic adjectives are subject to the same rule as 
verbs. Adjectives like tender, tiny and holy which contain no 
heavy syllables are stressed on the initial syllable. Adjectives 
like evil, timid and livid whose second syllable ends in a 
consonant and therefore 'ought to be' heavy are, in fact, 
stressed on the first syllable because the final consonant 
is extrametrical. The part of the syllable that is 'seen' by 
the rule is light (a consonant followed by a short vowel). 
Lastly, adjectives like robust, morose and alive are stressed 
on the second syllable because their second syllables are 
heavy. 
Next, let us turn to disyllabic nouns. 

236 Stress and intonation 
Begin by marking the syllable which receives primary stress 
in the words below: 
[11.22] (a) pity 
picture 
(b) magic 
(c) almond 
(d) canoe 
(e) police 
baby 
ferry 
tulip 
contact 
bamboo 
alert 
sugar 
panda 
mason 
subject 
bazaar 
debate 
river 
butter 
foetus 
dentist 
settee 
cartoon 
In [n.22a-c] primary stress falls on the first syllable while 
in [n.22d-e] it falls on the second syllable. As before, a 
right-headed tree is constructed for each word. Where there 
is no heavy syllable, a disyllabic word is stressed on the first 
syllable. But if a word contains a heavy syllable, stress goes 
on the heavy syllable nearest to the end of the word. 
Note, however, this crucial difference between nouns 
on the one hand and verbs and adjectives on the other: for 
the purposes of this rule, a heavy syllable in a noun must 
contain a long vowel or diphthong. While in verbs and 
adjectives only the final consonant is extrametrical, in 
nouns, any consonants following the final vowel are extra-
metrical. This means that the presence of consonants after 
a vowel does not contribute to syllable weight in nouns. 
Thus, in [11.22a] nouns like pity, whose second syllable 
is light are stressed on the first syllable. Similarly, the first 
syllable is stressed in both [11.22b and c] because of the 
extrametricality of any consonant following the vowel in 
the second syllable. Consequently, the part of the second 
syllable that is 'seen' contains a short (lax) vowel and there-
fore cannot be stressed. 
However, nouns like police [n.22e] whose second 
syllable contains a long vowel (followed by one or more 
extrametrical consonants), are stressed on the second 
syllable just like nouns such as canoe [n.22d] which end in 
a long vowel or diphthong. All that matters is whether or 
not the second syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong. 
In other words, with regard to the disyllabic noun stress 
rule, only the nucleus of the second syllable is projected. 
The noun stress rule only 'sees' the syllable nucleus: if the 

Introduction: stress 237 
nucleus branches (i.e. contains a long vowel or diphthong), 
stress is on the final syllable. Otherwise, stress is on the 
initial syllable. 
We can now move on to longer words. We shall observe 
that the stress rule that applies in longer words is remi-
niscent of the Latin stress rule. 
Study the data in [11.23] and work out the rule that deter-
mines location of primary stress: 
[11.23] (a) cinema 
Agatha 
effigy 
Malibu 
jeopardy 
overture 
calumny 
Salisbury 
(b) Ga/apagos And'gone America 
rhinoceros 
epitome 
(c) tornado 
rhododendron 
aroma 
psycnosis 
bronchitis 
Theresa 
brontosa«rus 
As in Latin, the stress placement algorithm creates a 
right-hand headed tree, ignoring the final syllable, which 
is extrametrical. Stress lands on the penultimate syllable if 
it is heavy, [see 11.23c] but if the penultimate is light, stress 
goes on the ante-penultimate syllable (see [11.23a, b]). 
Up to this point we have only considered stress in 
simple words. We have not examined yet the problem of 
stress placement in complex words which consist of a root 
and one or more affixes, which may be prefixes or suffixes. 
Interestingly, in English the addition of a prefix tends not 
to affect the placement of stress. Usually words are stressed 
in the same way with or without prefixes: 
t 
* 
* 
* 
[11.24] write 
rewrite 
polite 
impolite 
examine 
re-examine 
gratitude 
ingratitude 
political 
apolitical 
moral 
amoral 
The effect of the addition of suffixes is much more 
fascinating because different suffixes affect stress placement 
in different ways. First, there are suffixes whose presence 
has no effect on the primary stress of the root to which they 
are attached. A good example of this can be seen by 
observing what happens when the suffix -ment is added to 
a verb stem like govern to yield the noun government. The 

238 Stress and intonation 
position of stress remains unchanged. Likewise, the suffixes 
-ness as in kindness and -Jul as in fdithjul have no effect on 
stress. 
Another class of suffixes attract stress to themselves as 
though they were magnets. When they are attached to a 
word they always get the main stress. They include -ette as 
in maisonette and kitchenette, -esque as in picturesque and 
grotesque. (These suffixes are borrowed from French and 
obey the French stress rule.) 
Add two more examples to this list. 
A third class of suffixes make the primary stress move 
to the syllable immediately preceding them. That is the case 
when a suffix like -ic is added to a stem like democrat to 
derive the adjective democratic or when the suffix -ity is added 
to the stem public to produce publicity. 
(a) Write down three examples of words containing each 
of the suffixes -some, -hood, -ity and -ic. 
(b) Contrast the effect on stress placement of the presence 
of the suffixes -some and -hood on the one hand and 
-ity and -ic on the other. 
You will have discovered that -some and -hood have no 
effect on stress. A word is stressed on the same syllable with 
or without these suffixes. However, the suffixes -ity and 
-ic do affect stress placement in the base to which they are 
attached: they attract stress to the syllable immediately 
before them. Interestingly, the rule, which attracts stress to 
the syllable before the suffix is a QUANTITY INSENSI-
TIVE rule - it puts stress on that syllable regardless of 
whether the syllable is light or heavy. Suffixes like -ity and 
-ic which attract stress to the syllable immediately preceding 
them are called STRONG MODE SUFFIXES. 
There is a fourth category of suffixes which is similar 
to the strong mode suffixes in that they also affect stress 
placement in the base form to which they are attached 
although they are not stressed themselves. But unlike strong 
mode suffixes, this class contains QUANTITY SENSI-

which put stress on the 
immediately 
preceding syllable only if it is heavy either because it has 
a long vowel or a diphthong: 
[11.25] adjectival 
arrival 
homicidal 
betrayal 
recusal 
rental 
or because it is closed by a consonant:

If the preceding syllable is light, stress misses it out and 
falls two syllables before it:

Sufffixes of this kind which only manage to attract stress 
to the syllable immediately before them if it is heavy, and 
otherwise attract stress to the second syllable to their left 
are called WEAK MODE SUFFIXES. 
11.2 Intonation 
All languages use pitch. This, in part, is an automatic 
consequence of the fact that any time a voiced sound is 
produced, the vocal cords vibrate at a certain rate. The rate 
of vibration corresponds closely to the pitch perceived by 
the hearer: the higher the rate of vibration the higher is the 
perceived pitch. The fact that pitch differences can be 
observed in the utterances of any language is in itself of no 
great linguistic interest. 
What linguists are interested in are the ways in which 
pitch differences are functionally harnessed. In broad terms, 
pitch differences can be exploited in two distinct ways. 
Within the domain of the word, pitch can be used to 
contrast lexical meaning or to mark grammatical properties, 
as we saw in the last chapter. In that case we speak of tone. 
Alternatively, the domain of pitch can be an entire utter-
ance, in which case we speak of intonation. It would be 
wrong to classify languages as either tonal or intonational 
because all languages have intonation. That includes tone 
languages, as the discussion of downdrift in Chapter 10 

240 Stress and intonation 
showed. One of the issues that has rightly received a good 
deal of attention from phonologists is the way in which 
intonation meshes together with stress in a stress language, 
and with tone in a tone language. 
In the next section we shall outline some of the main 
features of English intonation. This sketch is not meant to 
be a comprehensive description. Rather it is merely intended 
to give us a glimpse at the workings of intonation in a stress 
language.2 
11.2.1 The form of English intonation 
Just as the syntactician focuses on the sentence as the key 
unit of grammatical analysis, the phonologist focuses on the 
TONE 
UNIT 
(also 
called 
the 
PHONOLOGICAL 
PHRASE) as the most significant domain in terms of which 
intonation contours reflecting the pitch of utterances are 
assigned. 
For the purposes of intonation analysis, the English 
tone unit has the following internal organisation: 
tonic 
[11.28] (pre-head) head 
or 
(tai7) 
nucleus 
The nucleus is the central element in a tone unit. It 
contains the syllable in an utterance which undergoes 
significant pitch movement - and is consequently more 
prominent than the rest. That syllable is the NUCLEUS or 
TONIC 
SYLLABLE. The tonic syllable is normally 
preceded by a HEAD. The head is the part of the tone unit 
extending from the first stressed syllable to the syllable 
immediately preceding the tonic syllable. Optionally, a head 
can be preceded by a PRE-HEAD. This consists of any 
unstressed syllables that occur in front of the first stressed 
syllable of the head. Again, optionally, a tonic syllable can 
be followed by a TAIL. The tail contains any syllables 
(which may or may not be stressed) following the tonic 
syllable. 
Say the sentence in [11.29] noting the way pitch fluc-
tuates. Produce two analogous examples of your own and 
state verbally the pitch movements which you observe. 

Intonation 241 
[11.29] 
|| He will phone you when all the children are back. || 
Ph 
H 
Ts 
T 
key: Ph = pre-head; H = head; Ts — tonic syllable; T 
= tail 
Normally pitch is low in the pre-head, more or less 
level high in the head and falling on the tonic; in the tail 
the pitch pattern established on the tonic is simply 
continued. 
The most common direction of pitch movement on the 
tonic is downward. As we saw in section 10.5, linguists 
talk of DOWNDRIFT in tone languages when they 
describe the tendency for high tones to be somewhat 
lowered when preceded by a low tone, a phenomenon 
which results in falling intonation. In many stress languages 
like English the same downdrift (also called DECLI-
NATION LINE) can be observed. Frequently pitch moves 
down on the tonic syllable and remains down until the end 
of the utterance. Pitch tends to be much lower at the end 
of an utterance than it is at the beginning. FALLING 
INTONATION, which is exemplified by [10.30], is the 
unmarked intonation pattern in English. 
["•30] 
'James Thurber was born in O hio. 
l_ 
The widespread tendency to drop pitch as the end of 
an utterance approaches might have a physiological expla-
nation. Possibly, as the speaker gradually runs out of 
breath, there is less and less air to cause the vibration of the 
vocal cords and consequently they vibrate more sluggishly 
and the pitch of the utterance goes down. (At the same 
time, in some languages like Luganda, the intensity of the 
signal also declines, so that the end of the utterance is 
auditorily less salient than the beginning.) 
It is reasonable to ask what the functions of intonation 
are. Does pitch fluctuation serve any linguistic purpose? 
Some answers to this question are outlined below. 

242 Stress and intonation 
11.2.2 Accentuation function 
Word stress interacts with intonation. One of the words in 
a sentence has a syllable which stands out above the rest. 
This is the syllable which has SENTENCE STRESS - also 
called TONIC STRESS. Such a syllable is sometimes 
referred to as the TONIC SYLLABLE. In unmarked cases, 
tonic stress goes on the syllable which carries primary word 
stress in the last lexical item of the tone unit. Such a lexical 
item is often a noun, an adjective or a verb. The tonic 
syllable is underlined in the examples below: 
[11.31] They are working. 
Joan has not seen him. 
The children are in the playground. 
In marked cases, the above rule is superseded by a rule 
which allows CONTRASTIVE (or EMPHATIC) STRESS 
to fall on grammatical (function) words such as pronouns, 
prepositions and conjunctions if the speaker wishes, for 
some communicative reason, to draw attention to such 
words or alternatively, contrastive stress may occur on non-
final lexical items: 
[11.32] (a) She is studying linguistics. 
She is studying linguistics. 
She is studying linguistics, 
(b) She travelled from London. 
She travelled from London. 
She travelled fo London. 
She travelled to London. 
How does the location of the tonic syllable affect the ways 
in which these sentences can be interpreted? 
The accentual function is the most basic function of 
intonation. In unmarked cases tonic stress is often used to 
make a syllable in the lexical word containing new infor-
mation stand out. But in marked cases, the tonic syllable 
can be the most prominent syllable of virtually any word 
which the speaker chooses to highlight. 

Intonation 243 
11.2.3 Intonation and illocutionary force 
The choice of intonation pattern is not entirely free. In a 
language such as English certain 
ILLOCUTIONARY 
ACTS (= acts of speaking) such as making statements and 
asking questions, are typically performed using certain 
intonation patterns. I use the word 'typically' advisedly. 
The deployment of intonation contours is not determined 
by rigid, exceptionless rules. A given illocutionary act may 
be performed without using the intonation pattern indicated 
here. But nevertheless, certain intonation patterns are much 
more likely to be used to perform certain illocutionary acts 
than others. 
The tone unit type with a level head and a falling 
nucleus (' h " n), which is the only one introduced so far, 
is unmarked. It is the intonation pattern that is assigned 
when there is no good reason for doing otherwise. For 
example, it is normally used in statements, in imperatives 
and in wh- questions (i.e. questions beginning with the 
words why, where, when, what, which etc.). You can verify 
this by reading the sentences below in a neutral way and 
observing the intonation contour which you use: 
[11.33] (a) Statements: ' h ' n 
'Mary lives in ' Lancaster. 
'The shops are ' dosed. 
(b) WH questions: ' h y n 
'When did Mary x go there? 
'What is your v name"? 
(c) Imperatives: ' h " n 
Just 'eat up your ' dinner\ 
ySit\ 
Note: the head and tail are both optional. They 
can both be omitted from a tone unit, as in the 
last example. Only the nucleus is obligatory. 
Besides falling intonation, another common (but some-
what marked) type is the LOW RISE (rh,n) where the head 
is level and the nucleus rises slightly. This pattern is often 
found in YES/NO QUESTIONS 
where the speaker 
queries an item and expects simple confirmation or denial: 
[11.34] Are your 'friends going to the ,party~l 
Will you re'tire next ,year? 

244 Stress and intonation 
I will mention just one more tone unit type, HIGH 
RISE (' ' N). This has a level head and a high rising nucleus. 
The head may be optionally omitted. This is common in 
elliptical questions like: 
[11.35] ' coming? ('Are you 'coming) 
' tea anybody? 
' taxi? 
Optionally, the pitch of questions may be raised 
generally so that the upper range of the speaker's voice is 
employed. 
11.2.4 The grammatical function of intonation 
The interpretation of the meaning of a sentence in part 
involves knowing which words should be syntactically 
bracketed together. In writing, punctuation is used to group 
together words which grammatically and semantically form 
coherent units. In the spoken language intonation serves a 
similar purpose. 
Clear evidence of this can be seen by observing the way 
in which intonation is used to resolve syntactic ambiguity. 
Many sentences which are potentially ambiguous on paper 
are not ambiguous in their spoken form. For a long time 
linguists have been aware that the syntactic bracketing of 
potentially ambiguous constructions like old cars and buses 
can be clarified by intonation. The whole phrase is said as 
one unit if both the cars and buses are old. But it is said with 
an intonation break after cars if it is only the cars that are 
old. Effectively, intonation is used to indicate whether the 
adjective modifies just the first noun or both nouns. 
Say the sentences in [11.36] using in each case the intonation 
contour which reflects the syntactic bracketing. How do the 
sentences in each pair differ in meaning? 
[11.36] (a) Rioting [young men] and [women] were 
arrested. 
Rioting [young men and women] were 
arrested, 
(b) They are [cooking apples]. 
They [are cooking] apples. 

Intonation 245 
The syntactic functions of intonation can also be 
considered from the angle of language processing. We have 
seen that tone groups usually mark off major syntactic 
constituents like noun phrases and verb phrases. That is 
what enables them to disambiguate sentences. In addition, 
the syntactic units marked by intonation seem to have some 
kind of psychological relevance in language processing. 
Thus, it is decidedly odd to place a tone group boundary 
inside a syntactic constituent. Pauses and any hesitations 
tend to coincide with syntactic boundaries. 
(a) Parse the sentences below and show their major 
syntactic units. 
(b) Where could you hesitate in each one of these 
sentences? Where are the potential intonation breaks? 
[11.37] (a) The man to whom John was talking gave 
him the book. 
(b) Frank and David or Helen went to the 
party. 
(c) When she left the dog started barking. 
I hope you have discovered that the natural way of 
marking intonation boundaries and the places where hesi-
tation is likely to occur involves identifying major syntactic 
divisions: 
[11.38] (a) subject (noun phrase) 
|| The man to whom John was talking | 
predicate (verb phrase) 
gave him the book.|| 
(b) subject (noun phrase) 
predicate (verb phrase) 
|| Frank and David or Helen | went to the 
party. || 
(c) subordinate clause 
main clause 
|| When she left | the dog started barking. || 
'GARDEN PATH' sentences like [11.38c], for which one 
of the most obvious parsings is wrong, are often assigned 
the wrong intonation before the speaker works out the 
correct syntactic analysis. You were probably momentarily 
tempted to parse c. thus: 
[11.38] *|| When she left the dog | started barking.|| 

246 Stress and intonation 
with an intonation break after dog, before you realised that 
the principal division here is between the main clause and 
the subordinate clause: dog is the subject of the verb started 
in the main clause and not the object of the verb leji in the 
subordinate clause. 
11.2.5 Attitudinal functions 
Intonation also has an attitudinal function. Inferences can be 
drawn from intonation about the speaker's ATTITUDE. 
We all have heard someone say 'It was not what he said, 
but the way he said it . . .' or 'It is the tone of voice she 
used that really upset me'. 
We can all mean different things with the same words 
by modulating our intonation. Utterances may perform 
different illocutionary acts depending on the speaker's atti-
tude as it is revealed through intonation. An utterance like 
sit down or come back can be a command, a polite invitation 
or a threat. 
The meaning of an utterance depends on many factors. 
Most obviously it depends on the semantic content of the 
words as well as the grammatical and logical relationships 
between the words used in an utterance. Less obviously, it 
depends on the CONTEXT OF UTTERANCE 
(the 
linguistic context in which the words are uttered and the 
background situation known to be relevant by both the 
speaker and hearer); it depends on the PARALINGUISTIC 
features, e.g. gestures, facial expression and voice quality 
employed; and it depends on the intonation used by the 
speaker. Intonation seems to play a role in conveying atti-
tudinal meaning. But the contribution made by intonation 
per se is not easy to isolate with any certainty. It is therefore 
not feasible to establish a simple, direct correlation between 
intonation and attitude. 
One area where a clear link has been established is in 
QUESTION TAGS. Normally, falling intonation in the 
tag indicates a quest for confirmation: 
[11.39] 'George is a x lawyer, ' isn't he? 
But rising intonation indicates a greater degree of uncer-
tainty, with the speaker not merely seeking confirmation 
but rather wanting to have a real doubt cleared: 

Intonation 247 
[11.40] 'George is a ' lawyer, ,isn't he? 
Elsewhere the link between intonation and attitude is 
obscure. At best what we can do is outline various factors 
affecting attitudinal judgements. But it would be rash to 
claim that these factors determine attitudinal judgements. 
One important factor affecting attitudinal judgements 
is VOICE QUALITY. Phoneticians have become increas-
ingly aware of the importance of voice quality as a factor 
influencing attitudinal judgements (Laver 1980; Knowles 
1987: 211-14). Some of the properties of a speaker's voice 
are INDEXICAL in the sense that they convey some infor-
mation about the speaker to the hearer. Some indexical 
features are relatively permanent. A speaker's sex, age, 
membership of a social group, regional origins or social 
class membership can often be inferred from voice quality. 
These indexical features cannot be easily changed by the 
speaker. Other indexical features of voice quality such as 
laryngitis or a cold or being drunk are more transient. The 
addressee can make various favourable or unfavourable 
judgements about the speaker on the basis of voice quality 
features of the kind that I have listed. 
A speaker can also deliberately attempt to convey atti-
tudinal information by combining a voice quality trait with 
a purposeful use of pitch. We observed above that the 
commonest intonation contour in English is a level head 
followed by a falling nucleus. The SLOPE (or gradient) of 
the fall is variable. In unmarked circumstances the fall is 
gentle. If a speaker opts for a very steep slope, this is likely 
to convey a peremptory, abrupt or domineering attitude, 
especially when accompanied with harsh voice quality. 
Try saying 'Come here !' varying the slope and harshness of 
the voice quality. Describe the circumstances in which each 
version of the sentence would be appropriate. 
A further variable which has to be considered is PITCH 
RANGE. There is some correlation between pitch range 
and emotion. 
Say this sentence varying pitch range: 
[11.41] (a) I am so glad to see you. 
(b) Hello! 

248 Stress and intonation 
If a total stranger ran up to you in the street and said 
[ii-42] 
Hello! 
You would probably think it was a case of mistaken iden-
tity. If, on the other hand, when a long lost friend turns up 
at your door you say: 
[11.43] I am so glad to see you again. 
\ 
that would be interpreted as a frosty welcome. 
When people are excited they use the upper part of 
their speech range much more than they do normally. This 
is usually accompanied by an increase in LOUDNESS and 
TEMPO. When depressed or sad, on the other hand, people 
tend to use mostly the lower part of their pitch range and 
to talk more slowly and more quietly. 
There are no cast iron rules which govern the use of 
intonation to signal attitude. There are only tendencies. The 
right interpretation of an utterance depends only in part on 
intonation. As we saw above, there are many other vari-
ables which need to be considered. It would be naive to 
attempt to establish a simple, one-to-one 
correlation 
between attitude and intonation. 
11.2.6 Discourse function 
Talk rarely consists of isolated utterances. The norm is for 
utterances to be strung together, and in conversation for the 
roles of speaker and hearer to be swopped frequently. Inton-
ation plays a crucial role in the structuring and gluing 
together of discourse. 
Intonation is normally used to indicate NEW INFOR-
MATION (which the addressee is assumed by the speaker 

Intonation 249 
not to already possess) as opposed to GIVEN INFOR-
MATION (which is known or assumed to be already 
known to the addressee). Given information is kept in the 
background. It is not in FOCUS. But new information is 
foregrounded. It is in focus. One of the words conveying 
new information is highlighted by making one of its syl-
lables the tonic syllable. 
Imagine an exchange like [n.44] in a butcher's shop: 
[11.44] John: 
Do you 'like ' tripe? 
Mary: 
I ' loathe tripe, (or / ' loathe it) 
When John asks the question, tripe is new information and 
receives tonic stress (the word 'information' is being used 
in a very broad sense). But when Mary replies, tripe is 
already established as the topic of the conversation and 
needs no highlighting. So, tonic stress falls on loathe. It 
would be very odd if in Mary's reply tonic stress was on 
tripe (* / 'loathe * tripe). 
Furthermore, intonation plays an important role in 
turn-taking in dialogue. A fall usually indicates a completed 
turn, without the expectation of one's interlocutor replying. 
But a rise gives a strong indication that the speaker intends 
to continue, or that a response from one's interlocutor is 
expected. A simple example of this can be seen in VOCA-
TIVES and in YES-NO QUESTIONS: 
[11.45] (a) Vocative 
' ' Janet (in fact the fall rise is often levelled 
to —Ja~net) 
(b) Yes-No question 
Have you 'lived here for a long ,time? 
It is possible to use falling intonation when calling a 
person's name e.g. when a school teacher shouts at a 
naughty boy: "Smith rather than ' ' Smith. What is the 
difference between these two utterances? 
A fall-rise calling nucleus (coupled with generally raised 
pitch) is the intonation pattern normally used to attract the 
addressee's attention. However, a falling nucleus can also 
be used for this purpose - with somewhat different prag-

250 Stress and intonation 
matic force. In our example, (especially if the teacher has 
a stern look and uses loud and harsh voice quality) this 'call' 
will in fact probably be interpreted as meaning: 
[11.46] ' pay attention * Smith. 
One of the things that have emerged from this chapter 
is the fact that phonology has to be placed in a wider 
context. The discussion of the attitudinal functions of inton-
ation showed the way in which phonology overlaps with 
verbal paralinguistic properties such as voice quality, pitch-
range and tempo. These paralinguistic properties are not 
part of the linguistic system proper although they impinge 
on it. 
The relationship between language and paralanguage 
(which includes not only verbal non-linguistic properties 
such as voice quality and pitch-range but also non-verbal 
features like eye-contact and posture) is an interesting topic 
and has attracted considerable interest in the literature (see 
Argyle (1974); Laver and Hutcheson (1972); Laver (1980) 
and Lyons (1977)). Unfortunately, we do not have the space 
to pursue it here. 
What we shall explore is the relationship between 
phonology and the other core components of the linguistic 
system. At several points in the book we have seen that 
phonology impinges on grammar and meaning. In the 
concluding chapter we shall focus on this interaction.

Notes 
There is a very rich literature on stress in English. SPE 
is the classic generative work on the subject and any 
serious student of English stress ought to be familiar 
with its contents. For an introductory textbook which 
explores English stress in an accessible way from a non-
metrical, non-generative point of view see Knowles 
(1987). Fudge 1984 is another recent non-metrical, 
well-exemplified 
general survey of English stress. 
Hogg and McCully (1987) is an advanced introductory 
textbook on metrical phonology. It examines English 
stress in considerable detail.

metrical phonologists like Hayes (1982, 1983, 1984) 
Liberman and Prince (1977) and Prince (1983).

CHAPTER 12 
Phonology in the Wider 
Context 
12.1 The role of the lexicon 
Linguistic theory is interested in sound not just for its own 
sake, but because it is the medium in which speech is real-
ised. Phonology has to be put in a wider context so that its 
interaction with the other components of the grammar can 
be understood. At the beginning of the book, we saw how 
sounds are used phonemically to contrast word meaning; 
in the last two chapters we have considered the grammatical 
and semantic/pragmatic and discourse functions of tone, 
stress and intonation. In this final chapter we are going to 
continue with the theme of the relationship between phon-
ology and the rest of the grammar, but this time from a 
different perspective. We shall highlight the ways in which 
phonology interfaces with the lexicon and morphology on 
the one hand, and with syntax on the other. 
I think the most promising analysis of the relation 
between phonology, morphology and the lexicon is the 
model 
of 
LEXICAL 
P H O N O L O G Y 
AND 
MORPHOLOGY 
(normally referred to as LEXICAL 
PHONOLOGY for short). Although it is a recent devel-
opment, this trend already boasts a substantial amount of 
literature (see Kiparsky 1982a, 1982b, 1985; Halle and 
Mohanan 1985; Mohanan 1985; Kaisse and Shaw 1985; 
Rubach 1985; Pulleyblank 1986). 
As its name suggests, lexical phonology gives the 
LEXICON a key role. This represents a significant depar-
ture from previous models. Traditionally, all regular 
processes were dealt with by rules of the grammar. The 
lexicon was seen as being no more than an appendix to the 
grammar, containing unpredictable idiosyncratic phono-

The role of the lexicon 255 
logical, grammatical, semantic and lexical information about 
morphemes and lexical items. These different kinds of 
information would be included in the lexicon because of 
their relevance to the application of semantic, syntactic, 
morphological and phonological rules. 
Phonological information is relevant because speakers 
need to know how words are pronounced. A lexical repre-
sentation must contain a distinctive feature matrix showing 
the representation of the 'segments' which make up the 
word. In addition, it must contain any idiosyncratic infor-
mation concerning the association of phonological elements 
at different phonological tiers. For instance, in a tone 
language, it must show any syllables which are underlyingly 
linked with a tone in the lexicon and which do not get 
assigned tone by regular association principles. In a stress 
language like English, the lexicon may have to show the 
special effects which a particular suffix has on the stress 
pattern of the base to which it is attached. As we saw in 
the last chapter, some suffixes like -ee (in detainee) attract 
stress to themselves while others, like -ity (in electricity) 
attract stress to the immediately preceding syllable. 
Furthermore, the lexicon must contain a list of forms 
which are exceptions to particular rules as well as a state-
ment of sub-regularities in the language. For example, it 
needs to show that sheep is exceptional in having no overt 
marking of plural while words like memoranda, memorabilia, 
agenda and data, which are borrowed from Latin, form a 
minor subsystem, where the plural ending -a is used. 
The lexicon needs to show the various subclasses to 
which words belong because some morphological and 
phonological rules only apply to certain subclasses of 
words. This is most obvious in the differential treatment of 
loanwords in many languages. In English, for instance, 
word-formation 
rules are sensitive to the distinction 
between native forms and forms borrowed from Latin or 
French. Thus, except for the word oddity, only foreign 
words of Latin or French origin take the noun-forming 
suffix -ity as in banality, ferocity and community. The same is 
true at the phonological level. To take one example, the 
phoneme /$/ 
only occurs in English words of French 
origin. Some of these words are fairly recent borrowings 
such as genre, rouge and beige while others, such as vision, 

256 Phonology in the wider context 
usual, occasion and pleasure were borrowed from Old French 
during the Middle Ages. 
It is also necessary to include in the lexicon grammat-
ical properties of words like [+noun], [+adjective] or 
[+verb], not only because they are, obviously, relevant to 
the application of syntactic rules but also because they may 
be important for certain word-formation and phonological 
rules. For instance, in English -ly can only be attached to 
adjective bases to form adverbs (e.g. the adverb wisely from 
the adjective wise). To take another example, /f/ is realised 
as [v] when an -s suffix is added after it only where the -s 
in question represents the noun plural ending (as in wife 
(singular) and wives (plural). Where the -s suffix represents 
the genitive ending as in wife's, the final /f/ of the noun is 
unaffected by the suffix. 
Finally, the reason for including semantic information 
in the lexical representation 
of words hardly 
needs 
explaining. To the lay person, listing word meanings is the 
function of the dictionary. But semantic information must 
be included for an additional reason: namely, because it can 
have a role in both morphological and phonological 
processes. It has been noted by students of English word-
formation, for example, that the negative prefix un-, which 
occurs in words like uninteresting, is not freely attachable to 
adjectives at the negative end of an implied evaluative scale. 
We can form words like un-happy, un-well and un-exciting 
but not *un-sad, *un-ill or *un-boring. 
Our last illustration of a semantic constraint on the 
applicability of a phonological rule comes from Luganda. 
Although Luganda allows nasal plus glide clusters e.g. 
[mwa:na] 'child', [mja:lo] 'ports', [jiwa] 'drink', the cluster 
[nj] with an alveolar nasal followed by a palatal glide, 
though not outlawed, is severely restricted in its use. This 
is because it occurs almost exclusively in taboo words which 
belong to the semantic area of defecation - words such as 
[kunja] 'defecate', [kinjo] 'anus' and [munjoBoBo] 'dysen-
tery'. Because [nj] has taboo connotations, 
nowadays 
speakers tend increasingly to optionally palatalise under-
lying /n/ wherever it is followed by a palatal glide so that 
words like [kanja:la] 'immature banana' or [munjongo] 
'miserable foreigner' are realised as [kajia:la] and [mujio:jigo] 
respectively, with a palatal nasal. Thus the offending [nj] 
sequence is avoided. 

Lexical phonology 257 
12.2 Lexical phonology 
We noted in the last section that traditionally, the lexicon 
has been regarded as nothing more than an appendix to the 
grammar which contains the idiosyncratic properties of 
lexical items and morphemes. 
Lexical phonology takes a different stance: the lexicon 
is recognised as a central component of the grammar which 
contains not only idiosyncratic properties of words and 
morphemes, but also regular word-formation and phono-
logical rules. It is assumed that word-formation rules of the 
morphology are directly paired with phonological rules 
grouped together at various levels. The output of each 
morphological rule is cycled through the phonology so that 
the relevant phonological rules of that level are applied to 
it. One of the main claims of lexical phonology is that both 
inflectional and derivational word-formation processes can 
be displayed on a series of linked LEVELS (also called 
STRATA). This is shown in the diagram in [12.1] which 
is adapted from Kiparsky 1982a:

258 Phonology in the wider context 
The rules of morphology and phonology applying 
within the lexicon are essentially CYCLICAL. This is 
because, as we shall see presently, rules are made to apply 
in a CYCLE first to the root, then outward to the affixes 
nearest to the root and then again outward to the outer layer 
of affixes. In other words, in this theory the word can be 
likened to an onion with the root of the word as the core 
and LEVEL i as the inner layer, LEVEL 2 as the outer layer 
and POST-LEXICAL PHONOLOGY as the skin on the 
outside. 
During a derivation there is a constant cycling of data 
through the interlocking phonological and morphological 
rules at each level:

The rules themselves are assumed to have the structure

12.2.1 Level 1 of lexical phonology 
In lexical phonology it is assumed that the lexicon has 
internal structure. It is not merely a list. Furthermore, it is 
assumed that the structure of the lexicon is HIERAR-
CHICAL. There has been some dispute as to how many 
structural levels need to be recognised. Halle and Mohanan 
(1985) argue for a four-level morphology. This is contro-
versial. The consensus is that the theory should be as simple 
as possible. Nothing would be gained by putting each pair 
of phonological and morphological rules found in a 

Lexical phonology 259 
language on a level of their own. But determining the 
minimal number of strata that is sufficient to account for 
all the wrinkles in the data is not easy. It is a problem which 
is still being intensively researched. My preference for the 
simple model with two lexical strata and one post-lexical 
stratum is not meant to prejudge the outcome of these 
investigations. 
The onion metaphor captures succinctly the essentials 
of lexical phonology. At the centre of the word there may 
be an UNDERIVED lexical item [12.1]. Underived lexical 
items consist of a single morpheme. They are forms such 
as big, boy, girl, talk and soon. No word-formation rule of 
any kind is used to produce such words. They appear in the 
lexicon with the phonological, grammatical and semantic 
properties with which they surface. 
Level 1 contains BOUND MORPHEMES like ah- and 
-duct in abduct or con- and -ate in conjugate which cannot 
occur independently but must always be attached to some 
other form. 
Some more words containing level 1 bound morphemes are 
given in [12.4] below. They show one of the important 
characteristics of level 1 affixes: they tend to be semantically 
opaque (i.e. their meaning is difficult to pin down): 
[12.4] (a) pertain 
contain 
detain 
(b) perceive 
conceive 
deceive 
(i) Identify the bound morphemes occurring in 
the words above. 
(ii) Identify the base and the affix in each 
example. 
(iii) Does each morpheme you identify have a 
constant meaning in all the words in which 
it occurs? 
Note: You are not expected to find the answer. 
This is an open ended question. For 
further discussion see Aronoff 1976:10 
-17-
It is easy to identify the bound morphemes in [12.4], 
which are all borrowed from Latin. They are the prefixes 

260 Phonology in the wider context 
per-, con- and de- which were prepositions, and the bases 
-tain and -ceiue. None of these forms can occur in isolation. 
The difficulty is in establishing their exact meaning, 
independent of some other morpheme with which they 
combine. For instance, in Latin per- was a preposition 
meaning 'by, through, by means of but it is doubtful 
whether any one of these meanings is always relevant to 
contemporary English speakers' use of words like pertain 
and perceive. Com- (of which con- is a variant) meant 'with, 
together with' but it is doubtful whether modern English 
speakers using the words contain and conceive are normally 
in any sense aware of these meanings. Finally, de- meant 
'from' or 'concerning' in Latin. Here again it is debatable if 
these meanings are salient in the minds of English speakers 
who have not had a classical education. 
Most of the affixes put on level i are the ones which, 
in studies inspired by SPE, were associated with the + 
boundary. These affixes have a much more intimate relation 
with the root to which they are attached than level 2 affixes, 
as we shall see below. 
Let us begin by considering inflectional morphology 
(i.e. grammatically determined alternation in the shape of 
a word involving categories like number and tense). We 
shall consider past tense formation in English for our first 
example. There are several ways of forming the past tense. 
In the second exercise at the end of Chapter 5 we saw the 
regular rule which suffixes [d], [t] or [id] to the verb stem. 
Verb morphology is not altogether regular. Instead of 
adding that ending, so-called STRONG VERBS undergo 
changes in the root itself of the kind shown below (ignore 
the consonants): 
[12.5] 
Present 
W [1] 
sing 
ring 
(b) [ai] 
fight 
(c) [a.] 
drive

(d) [i] 
~ 
[e]

read 
read 
(has) read 
meet 
met 
(has) met 
The forms in [12.5] show different sub-regularities which 
a grammar of English needs to capture. Level 1 rules would 
be used to state the vowel changes which are informally 
shown above. This illustrates another important property 
of level 1 rules: they tend to cause drastic changes in the 
root to which they are attached. 
By allowing the verb affixation rules responsible for the 
alternation in the root itself to apply at level 1, we are able 
to clear the way for the regular affixation processes which 
apply to verbs like walk ~ walked ~ (has) walked. Having 
received their past tense and perfective affixes at level 1, the 
verbs in [12.5] cannot undergo the more regular verbal 
affixation processes which apply later at level 2. The theory 
stipulates that all level 1 rules must precede all level 2 rules 
which, in turn, precede all post-lexical rules. If a particular 
rule applies at level 1, it will always have precedence over 
those rules which are at level 2; if a particular rule is at level 
2, it will always precede any rules which apply post-lexi-
cally. Thus the ordering of levels has serious implications 
for the way in which rules interact. 
Let us now take another batch of examples: 
[12.6] Noun 
Verb 
blood 
bleed 
food 
feed 
tooth 
teethe 
bath 
bathe 
house 
house 
In [12.6] to derive verbs from nouns, two level 1 rules 
are applied. One rule, which is applicable to all the exam-
ples, changes the vowel. In addition, where the final 
consonant is a voiceless fricative, another level 1 rule oper-
ates, changing it into a voiced fricative. 
Interestingly, the voicing of a final fricative is a phono-
logical rule which applies elsewhere in level 1 morphology: 
besides figuring in the derivation of verbs from nouns, it 
also plays a role in the formation of plural forms of certain 
nouns such as the following: 

262 Phonology in the wider context

Plural

~ 
[v] 
hoof

wife

First, state the level 1 word formation process going on in 
the examples below. Next state the phonological processes 
that are accompany it. 
[12.8] long 
length 
strong 
broad 
wide

The morphological process involved is the derivation 
of nouns from adjectives. Phonologically the -th suffix is 
added, triggering off a change in vowel quality from 
/ D / to /e/, /o/ to /e/ and /ai/ to /i/.' 
All level 1 affixes are not restricted to affecting the 
segmental phonology of the forms to which they are 
attached. They can also affect stress. The discussion of some 
English stress rules in section 11.1.6 highlighted on the one 
hand strong mode suffixes like -ity which attract stress to 
the immediately preceding syllable and on the other hand 
weak mode suffixes like -al which attract stress to the 
immediately preceding syllable, only if it is heavy; if the 
syllable preceding -al is light, stress is placed on the second 
syllable to the left of -al: 
[12.9] (a) Strong mode suffix -ity 
e/ertric

accountability 
impartial impartiality 
(b) Weak mode suffix -al 
medicine medicinal 
congress 
congressional 
adjective 
adjectival 
accident 
accidental 

Lexical phonology 263 
In the light of what has been said above, describe the 
effect of the following suffixes on stress placement: 
[12.10] (a) -ic 
as in phonemic 
-tide as in patricide 
-ious as in acrimonious 
(b) -ate 
as in accommodate 
-an 
as in American 
and academic 
and insecticide 
and fallacious 
and arrogate 
and Franciscan 
The suffixes in [12. ioa] are STRONG MODE ones: they 
place stress on any syllable preceding them while those in 
[12.10b] are WEAK MODE suffixes and only put stress on 
the preceding syllable if it is heavy; otherwise they shunt 
it onto the second syllable to their left. 
Certain level 1 suffixes can both affect stress and lead 
to the modification of the segments in a word. A classic 
example of this is the suffix -ity: 
[l2.ll] 
Adjective 
(a) sane 
profane 
(b) serene 
obscene 
(c) virile 
senile 
(d) profound 
pronounce 
H 
N

/ao/ 
Noun 
sanity 
profanity

senility 
profoundity 
pronounciation 
/*/ 
/e/ 
N 
N 
Find one more pair exemplifying the same vowel alternation 
as that displayed by the pairs in each group above. 
Observe that not only does the presence of the strong 
mode suffix -ity make stress move to the immediately 
preceding syllable (if it is not already in that position), it 
also causes the shortening (or laxing) of the diphthong or 
long (tense) vowel of the root which, as a result, is then 
realised as the corresponding short (lax) vowel. This vowel 
shortening 
rule 
is called 
TRISYLLABIC 
LAXING 
(SHORTENING) since it only applies to forms with at least 
three syllables (see section 8.2 page 139). 

264 Phonology in the wider context 
Trisyllabic laxing which is a level i rule, only applies 
to words formed at level i. A non-derived form, to which 
no morphological processes of affixation have applied, is 
exempt from trisyllabic laxing even when it has three or 
more syllables and on the face of it appears to satisfy the 
structural description of this rule. A word like nightingale 
[naitirjgeil] would be pronounced as *[nitirjgeil] if it were 
subject to trisyllabic shortening. But it is not. 
Nightingale 
/naitmgeil/ is an underived lexical item entered as such in 
the lexicon before any level i rules can apply. It is not 
eligible to undergo trisyllabic laxing which comes later at 
level i. 
This example is worth dwelling on for it illustrates an 
important principle, namely STRICT CYCLICITY. In this 
model, a phonological rule can only affect those strings of 
sounds that are put together by a word-formation 
rule 
applying at the same level. Thus level i rules may only 
modify structure created by level i morphological processes 
and level 2 rules may only change structure created by level 
2 morphological processes. The strict cyclicity principle 
ensures that rules only apply to one layer at a time. The 
output of a morphological rule at level 1, for instance, 
cannot undergo a level 2 phonological rule, and vice versa. 
A rule is not allowed to peep back at a state of affairs 
preceding arrival at the stratum where it applies, nor is it 
allowed to glance forward to what might happen at a later 
stage in a derivation. In a word, strict cyclicity results in 
a constrained theory which prohibits phonological rules 
from applying globally. The purpose of imposing restric-
tions of this kind on the theory is to ensure that we do not 
allow the grammar to have more power than is absolutely 
needed to describe the facts of natural language. 
Strict cyclicity ensures that phonological rules only 
have access to morphological information at the same level. 
When rules referring to grammatical information (which by 
convention is associated with brackets as in [deny/]verb|all]n0un) 
apply in the lexicon, the brackets get automatically erased 
so that subsequent rules at later levels are debarred from 
referring to that grammatical information. This principle, 
which is known as the BRACKET ERASURE C O N V E N -
TION, means that in order for a rule to apply, it is not 
necessary to delve into derivational history. 
For instance, 

Lexical phonology 265 
the regular plural formation rule in English applies in the 
same way to an underived noun like bird as it does to a 
derived noun like denial. 
In lexical phonology, the ordering of levels serves 
another 
function. 
It 
reflects 
DEGREES 
OF 
PRODUCTIVITY.3 Level i contains the most idiosyncratic 
morphological and phonological elements. Many level i 
rules are phonologically idiosyncratic: they tend to have 
many exceptions; they are rarely used in the formation of 
new words; the class of items they affect and the ways in 
which they affect them are usually messy. 
We have already noted that strong mode suffixes like 
-ity and weak mode suffixes like -al which cause stress shift 
when they are attached to a form all belong to level I. Level 
i affixes tend to cause more drastic modifications of the base 
to which they are attached than level 2 affixes. Thus, unlike 
the level i suffixes -al, -ic and -ity, level 2 suffixes like -er 
and -ness do not have any effect on stress: words are stressed 
in the same way regardless of the presence or absence of 
these suffixes. Thus, in words such as entertain ~ entertainer 
and aware ~ awareness no stress shift is caused by the 
addition of the level 2 suffixes -er and -ness. 
At the segmental level too, level i rules tend to show 
little regard for the integrity of the base form to which they 
are added. As we have seen, the suffix -ity frequently causes 
a modification of the segments of the base by triggering off 
trisyllabic laxing [12. n ] . In fact, the disruption caused may 
be even more drastic. It may include the deletion of part of 
the root: 
[12.12] frivolous 
frivolity 
(*frivolousity) 
anonymous 
anonymity 
(*anonymousity) 
credulous 
credulity 
(*credulousity) 
In [12.12] when -ity is attached to a form ending in -ous in 
the lexicon, deletion -ous takes place so that -ity surfaces in 
the phonetic representation next to the segment which 
preceded -ous. 
But this deletion process is sporadic. It fails in [12.13]: 
[12.13] religions 
religiosity 
(*religiousity) 
curious 
curiosity 
(*curiousity) 
precious 
preciosity 
(*preci'ousity) 

266 Phonology in the wider context 
Here the addition of -ity changes the pronunciation of -ous 
from [as] to [DS]. Clearly, the phonological effects of the 
addition of this suffix are messy (Aronoff 1976). 
The -ity suffix is not unique in having idiosyncratic 
phonological properties. Look back at [12.5], [12.6], [12.7] 
and [12.8] and see the changes in the base form due to the 
presence of various level 1 suffixes. Describe the phono-
logical effects of each suffix. 
Not only do level 1 affixes tend to be phonologically 
irregular, they also often tend to have idiosycratic semantic 
properties. Many level 1 affixes are semantically difficult to 
pin down. For instance, it is difficult to be specific about 
the meaning of the suffix -ity per se. True, in [12.11] it seems 
to derive from an adjective a noun which has the general 
meaning 'having the quality/state of being X', e.g. serenity 
is the state of being serene; divinity is the quality/state of 
being divine, etc. However, in many other cases it is not poss-
ible to identify a common thread of meaning which is 
shared by words containing that suffix: 
[12.14] amity 
'friendship' 
annuity 
'yearly income' 
community 
'group of people living in one 
locality' 
credulity 
'readiness to believe' 
Perhaps because of their phonological and semantic 
irregularity, many level 1 affixes are nothing more than 
historical relics. They are not productive. And others, 
though still productive, are only used infrequently to form 
new words. Thus, the suffix -th in length, width, depth is not 
used to form new nouns from adjectives in contemporary 
English, while the suffix -ity discussed above, though still 
used in word-formation is less productive than the level 2 
suffix -ness which it partially overlaps in meaning. The 
explanation, according to Aronoff (1976), might be that 
speakers are more confident to use -ness rather than -ity 
because they are unlikely to get things wrong (and make 
a fool of themselves) as -ness does not cause any phono-
logical changes in the base to which it is attached. More-

Lexical phonology 267 
over, unlike the semantically elusive -ity, the meaning of 
-ness is unproblematic. Its presence consistently produces a 
noun meaning 'the quality/state X specified by the adjec-
tive' (e.g. kindness, illness, etc.). 
Likewise, another level 2 suffix, the nominalising suffix 
-er that derives nouns from verbs (as in writer or maker) 
causes no phonological complications and has an obvious 
and uniform meaning of 'person who does whatever X is 
specified by the verb'.

If all morphemes are by definition 'meaningful units', 
it should be possible to state unequivocally the meaning of 
morphemes like -ery, -en and -al in [12.15]. But I suspect 
that you did not find that task altogether straightforward. 
The suffix -ery has no consistent meaning which recurs in 
all its occurrences in [12.15]. m cannery, fishery and nunnery 
it seems to have a locative meaning, but that meaning is 
absent from treachery, adultery, etc. Although the prefix en-
often has the meaning 'to put into or enclose within' as in 
to encase, attempting to extend that analysis to a word like 
employ would be questionable. 
(Note in passing the 
homorganic nasal assimilation process affecting the prefix 
in [12.15b]). Finally, the nominalising suffix -al typically has 
the meaning 'an act of doing X': an act of arriving consti-

268 Phonology in the wider context 
tutes an arrival, an act of denying constitutes a denial, etc. 
But this interpretation is not always valid - an act of 
appointing does not constitute an *appointal any more than 
an act of writing constitutes a *writal. There seems to be 
no good reason for the fact that certain verbs will take a 
given derivational suffix while others will not. 
The problem of erratic semantic behaviour is not 
restricted to affixes. Many roots to which affixes are 
attached do not have their own specific and consistent 
semantic content. It is not possible to say for instance what 
the roots -trib-, -duce and -tend mean below (unless you 
happen to know their original Latin meanings: tribut- 'allot, 
grant', 
due- 'lead' 
and tend- 'stretch'). 
As 
English 
morphemes, they are bound forms which never occur in 
isolation. Their meaning on any one occasion seems to 
depend on the meanings of the other morphemes with 
which they co-occur in the word: 
[i2.i6](a) contribute 
(b) conduce 
(c) contend 
attribute 
adduce 
attend 
distribute 
deduce 
distend 
retribution 
reduction 
retention 
tributary 
produce 
pretend 
tribute 
reduce 
intend 
The upshot of this discussioin is that we must abandon 
the view that the morpheme per se is the minimal mean-
ingful unit. The meaning of a root or affix is often unclear 
until it is put together with other morphemes in a word. 
The morpheme may be meaningful, as in the case of -er or 
in the case of a mono-morphemic word like dog, but it need 
not be. There are many bound roots like -trib- ,-duce and 
-tend which have no clear, identifiable meaning that remains 
constant when different affixes are attached to them. Simi-
larly, there are many affixes, as we have seen already, to 
which no steady meaning can be attributed. It is prudent 
to 
regard 
the 
morpheme 
primarily 
as 
a 
DISTRI-
BUTIONAL UNIT. What occupies centre stage, as far as 
signalling word meaning is concerned, is the word rather 
than the morpheme. Every word found in the lexicon of 
a language must be meaningful but every morpheme need 
not be (Aronoff 1976). 

Lexical phonology 269 
12.2.2 Level 2 of lexical phonology 
In the last section we established that level i rules are 
normally more idiosyncratic than level 2 rules. We saw that 
often the meaning of level i affixes is unclear, their phono-
logical effects unsystematic and their very applicability 
erratic, with many forms which on the face of it ought to 
undergo a particular level i rule failing to do so for no 
apparent reason. Level 2 rules on the other hand have fewer 
exceptions and their phonological effects and semantic prop-
erties are more predictable. Consider again -er, a typical 
level 2 affix. By suffixing -er to it, we can turn virtually any 
verb base into an agentive nominal meaning 'doer of 
activity X designated by the verb': 
[12.17] read-er 
mind-er 
paint-er 
speak-er 
teach-er 
join-er 
lead-er 
cook-er 
I say 'virtually' because even very regular level 2 rules 
can have occasional exceptions. For instance, there are agen-
tive nominals which are not formed by suffixing -er. Some 
agentive nominals are formed by a process known as 
CONVERSION 
or ZERO 
SUFFIXATION 
whereby 
morphological derivation is achieved without the overt 
addition of an affix, as in the case of judge („) which is 
derived from judge („) or bore („) from bore („) or cook („) 
from cook („). 
Yet other agentive nominals are formed by adding a 
suffix other than -er. That is the case in the formation of 
the nouns applicant and defendant from the verb apply and 
defend. These irregular nominalisations take place at level 1 
and block the regular level 2 process of adding -er to form 
agentive nominals. 
Another kind of irregularity is exemplified by the word 
cooker. It takes the regular ending -er, but its meaning is not 
the expected one of 'a person who cooks', rather it refers 
to an appliance used to perform the activity of cooking. 
Joiner is another problematic example. This word normally 
refers to a craftsman who constructs things by joining pieces 
of wood but it can also refer to a machine for doing various 

270 Phonology in the wider context 
kinds of work in wood. This second meaning is less 
common. 
Find more examples of semantic irregularity in word 
formation. Suggest a way in which the irregularity could 
be dealt with by the grammar. We shall come back to this 
problem in the next section. 
From a phonological point of view, the presence of the 
-ex ending has no repercussions: it does not affect stress 
placement nor does it affect the segments of a word in the 
way that a level i suffix like -th [12.8] or -ity [12.12] and 
[12.13] c a n do. 
The same applies to other level 2 derivational suffixes 
such as -jul, -ly, and -ness in [12.18]. There are almost no 
arbitrary restrictions on the class of forms to which they can 
be suffixed and they have no quirky phonological or 
semantic properties: 
[12.18] (a) handful 
(b) kindly 
(c) kindness 
cupful 
sadly 
illness 
plateful 
happily 
tiredness 
spoonful 
badly 
loudness 
12.2.3 The elsewhere condition 
The ordering of levels in lexical phonology implicitly deals 
with the problem of rule interaction which was discussed 
in Chapter 7 by incorporating the ELSEWHERE CON-
DITION (Kiparsky 1973, 1982b; Koutsoudas et al. 1974). 
This principle can be stated informally thus: 
If two rules compete for the same territory, 
the more specific rule applies first, 
blocking the more general rule. 
Normally, a more specific rule applies first and later the 
general rule applies elsewhere. So, putting an inflectional or 
derivational process at level 1 means that it is subject to a 
restricted rule which can pre-empt the application of a more 
general level 2 rule. In inflectional morphology, 
for 
instance, the elsewhere condition ensures that the formation 

Lexical phonology 271 
of the past tense forms of strong (irregular) verbs like those 
in [12.5] belongs to level 1 while the more general rules 
deriving the past tense forms of weak (regular) verbs belong 
to level 2: 
[12.19] 
(a) [sing + past] —> (saerj] (level 1) 
(pre-empts regular past tense formation 
at level 2) 
(b) [love + past] 
(i) (no access to level 1 morphology: so 
miss any level 1 word-formation rules) 
(ii) [IAV + d] —* [1Avd] (level 2 regular past) 
(love+ed —> loved) 
The effect of level ordering can be seen more clearly 
by examining the phenomenon of C O N V E R S I O N 
(or 
ZERO 
SUFFOCATION) 
whereby a word 
changes its 
category without the overt addition of an affix, as in a chair 
(„) and to chair („) or a man („) and to man („). 
Begin by noting that many strong verbs ending in -ing 
or -ink follow the pattern of sing ~ sang ~ sung (viz. ring 
~ rang ~ rung; sink ~ sank ~ sunk, etc.). Find two similar 
examples). However, when a verb is derived from a noun 
ending in -ink or -ing, the expected irregularity is lost. 
Thus, whereas we say 'ring ~ rang ~ rung' of ringing a bell, 
we say the town is 'ringed by mountains' not * ' rung by 
mountains'. 
Lexical phonology offers a simple explanation for these 
facts. The strong verb past tense formation takes place at 
level 1. The derived verb ring, which comes from a noun 
and has the meaning 'encircle' does not exist at the point 
when level 1 morphology takes place because the derivation 
of verbs from nouns occurs at level 2. Verbs derived from 
nouns can only undergo level 2 past tense inflection in the 
form of the regular -ed ending. 
The elsewhere condition is also useful in describing the 
formation 
of the plural of nouns. The regular 
plural 
formation rule which adds -s to form the plural of nouns 
is a level 2 rule while irregular plural formation whereby 
nouns take endings like -ren as in children or -/ as in cacti 
or -a as in addenda is a level 1 process. The addition of these 
irregular plural endings at level 1 blocks the application of 

272 Phonology in the wider context 
the regular plural formation rule. When forms such as 
[cact+ ipi] or [addend+ api] are produced at level i, it is 
not possible for the regular level 2 plural formation to apply 
later, yielding *[cact+ipi+spi] or *[addend+ ap|. + spl.] 
How can we extend our analysis to cover nouns such 
as equipment, accommodation, news and mumps which are 
inherently singular, or nouns like people, police, cattle, scis-
sors and trousers which are inherently plural? 
The case of inherently singular nouns is not proble-
matic. They have to be marked explicitly with a diacritic 
or a [-rule n] feature which shows that they are invisible to 
the rules that assign plural number. So, a word like equip-
ment would have a mark on it saying that it is not available 
to any plural formation rule. 
More interesting is the treatment of the inherently 
plural nouns. What we want to say is that certain words are 
unavailable for plural formation rules of any kind because 
they occur as plural underived lexical items in the lexicon. 
Kiparsky (1982b) suggests that each lexical entry be deemed 
to be a 'rule' - a special kind of lexical identity rule where 
the non-derived lexical item is the input and that same non-
derived lexical item emerges as the output. Then the deri-
vation of cattle or police, etc. could be handled as in [12.20]: 
[12.20] Structural description 
Structural change 
[[police] N + pi.] -> 
[[police]N + P J 
[[cattle]N + pi] -> 
[[cattle]N + pi] 
When the output of [12.20] reaches levels 1 and 2, no plural 
formation rule can affect it since it already bears the mark 
of plural. The elsewhere condition correctly predicts that 
being more specific, the idiosyncratic plural rules peculiar 
to 
certain 
nonderived 
lexical 
items 
like police take 
precedence over any more general level 1 or level 2 plural 
formation rule. 
We have seen how level ordering and the elsewhere 
condition offer a natural way of dealing with rule inter-
action in situations where one rule blocks another. Now we 
are going to see how the theory also provides a mechanism 
for dealing with rule interaction in cases where rules are in 

Lexical phonology 273 
a feeding relationship (i.e. where one rule creates the input 
to another rule (Chapter 7, page 125)). 
The theory predicts the irregular inflection derived at 
level 1 can form the input to more regular word-formation 
processes taking place at level 2. This is borne out by 
[12.21]: 
[12.21](a) paw-marks (*paws-marks) 
(b) lice-infested (*louse-infested) 
(Find two similar examples.) 
The possibility of level 1 irregular plural formation 
appearing in compounds suggests that level 1 rules can feed 
level 2 rules. Having undergone plural formation at level 
1, lice is still available for compounding later at level 2 in 
the formation of lice-infested. Unfortunately, the facts do not 
always give unequivocal support to this analysis. We would 
expect other irregular plurals formed at level 1 such as feet 
and teeth to appear in compounds as *feet-steps and *teeth-
brushes but instead we find footsteps and tooth-brushes. Some 
more investigations are needed to deal with the problem. 
12.2.4 The order of affixes 
In (12.2) we used the onion metaphor to describe word 
structure in lexical phonology. We return to that metaphor 
now and see how it sheds light on rule interaction in word 
formation by capturing the generalisation that level 1 affixes 
are placed nearer the root than level 2 affixes: 
[12.22] [[level 2 affi] [level 1 aff.] root [level 1 aff] 
[level 2 aff.]] 
Consider the nominalising suffix -ian as in politician, electri-
cian, grammarian 
and librarian, 
(and also the 
adjective-
forming 
suffix -ian as in Olympian, 
Aeolian, 
Bavarian, 
Edwardian, 
Dickensian 
and sesquipedalian) as well as the 
nominalizing suffix -ant as in applicant, inhabitant, attendant 
and communicant. These are all level 1 suffixes. Each one of 
them attracts stress to the syllable immediately preceding 
it in the same way that the level 1 suffixes -ic and -ity 
described earlier do. On the other hand, the suffix -ism as 
in baptism and communism, is a level 2 suffix. It does not 
modify the stress of the base to which it is attached. 

274 Phonology in the wider context 
The theory predicts that a level I affix will be nearer 
to the root than a level 2 suffix in cases where both occur 
in the same word: 
[12.23] Shakespear-w«-ww 
*Shakespear-»5m-w« 
antiquar-ujn-iim 
*antiquar-tsm-ian 
protest-ant-ism 
*protest-ism-ant 
A suffix at a given level can be followed by other 
suffixes at the same level as in [12.24a] where all the affixes 
in question are at level 1, or [12.24b] where all the suffixes 
are at level 2 : 
[12.24] (a) pub\-ic-ity 
pm-if-ic-at-ion 
(b) re-re-make 
czre-jul-ness 
Determine which of the suffixes in [12.25] are at level 
1 and which are at level 2. Does this have a bearing on the 
ordering of suffixes in a word? 
[12.25] electrification 
leaderless 
In electrification the suffixes -if(y) -ic-(at)ion are all level 
1 suffixes. This can be verified by seeing the way in which, 
like numerous level 1 suffixes, they all attract stress: e^lectrijy; 
electric and electrification. But in leaderless both suffixes are 
at level 2. They have no phonological effect on the base. 
Moreover, their meaning is reasonably clear and consistent 
as is the norm for level 2 affixes.4 
12.2.5 Post-lexical rules 
After all lexical rules have applied, words can be inserted 
in syntactic representations 
to form 
sentences. 
Once 
sentences have been formed, level 1 and level 2 rules of 
lexical phonology cannot apply any more. But that does not 
necessarily render words secure from all phonological 
modification. The sounds of individual words can still be 
modified 
by 
rules which 
apply 
in 
CONNECTED 

Lexical phonology 275 
SPEECH, affecting phrases or longer chunks of utterances. 
In this model such rules are called POST-LEXICAL 
RULES. They are late rules which apply after all lexical 
rules (see figure [12.i]). Unlike lexical rules, post-lexical 
rules are not intrinsically cyclic. The output of a lexical 
phonological rule is not submitted to the morphology or 
vice versa. Nor do they respect the strict cyclicity principle 
(section 12.2.1). Unlike lexical rules, post-lexical rules are 
not restricted to forms derived at the same stage in a deri-
vation. They can affect forms derived at an earlier stage. 
For our first illustration of a post-lexical rule we shall 
consider the floating tone in associative constructions in 
Mbui described by Hyman and Tadadjeu (1976: 61) which 
was introduced in [10.21]. The data are repeated here for 
convenience as [12.25]. 
[12.26] 
Mbui: 
(a) bakoa 'crabs' 
bandum 'husbands' 
(b) bakaa ba sag 
'the crabs of the bird' 
bandiim ba sag 'the husbands of the bird' 
In isolation both 'crabs' and 'husbands' have L-H tone. 
When, however, in the associative construction these words 
come together with a high tone word like [sag] as the 
second noun, the associative marker [ba] is realised with its 
underlying high tone after 'crabs' but is downstepped to 
'H after 'husbands'. Obviously, this downstepping is a post-
lexical rule since it only occurs in an associative phrase and 
is not present in words in isolation. 
For our next example of a post-cyclical rule we shall 
turn to Chi-mwini, a Bantu language of the Horn of Africa. 
Kenstowicz and Kisseberth (1977: 86) report that in this 
language all words have a short final vowel when they 
occur in isolation: 
[12.27] xpala 
'to scale' 
rjguwo 
'clothes' 
kuja 
'to eat' 
chisu 
'knife' 
navaile 
'that he dress' mashu:rjgi 'hair' 
hujo 
'one who eats' 
husoimo 'one who reads' 
But all word final short vowels are lengthened if they occur 
in phrase medial position in a sentence: 

276 Phonology in the wider context 
[12.28] xpalainsi 
kuja: nama 
navaleirjguwo 
hujo:zijo 
husomo:chuwo 
rjguwo:mphiya 
chisMichile 
mashurjgiimale 
to scale fish' 
to eat meat' 
that he put on clothes' 
one who eats zip 
one who reads' 
new clothes' 
knife' 
long hair' 
Suggest a rule to account for the alternation in vowel 
length in the words: navaile, husoimo and mashuir/gi when 
they occur phrase medially. 
A long vowel is shortened when it is followed by 
another long vowel within the same phonological phrase 
(marked by a tall bracket) as in navaleiQguwo: 
V 
[12.29] V -> [-long]/— C0[long]_ 
In addition to rules which apply only either lexically 
(within lexical items), or only post-lexically (across word 
boundaries), there exist other rules which apply anywhere 
their structural description is satisfied. Such rules are purely 
phonetically motivated. They get automatically triggered 
off wherever auspicious phonetic circumstances occur. An 
example of such a rule is the flapping rule in American 
English: 
V 
[12.30] /t/ —• [r] / V 
[- stress] 
/t/ is realised as [r] (a voiced consonant which 
sounds like a very short [d]) whenever it occurs 
intervocalically at the beginning of an unstressed 
syllable. 
This automatically happens within a single word like [pin] 
'pity' or across a word boundary as in [gent] 'get it'. 
The glottalisation rule that applies in broadly similar 
environments in non-standard British English, producing 
a gjottal shop allophone of /t/, is equally unrestricted. The 
phoneme /t/ has allophone p] when it occurs either in 
intervocalic position followed by an unstressed vowel or in 

Lexical phonology 277 
word-final position. Glottalisation applies lexically (within 
a single lexical item) as in [pi?i] 'pity', and post-lexically 
(i.e. across a word boundary) as in [ge'i?] 'get it'. 
The typical fast casual speech phenomena of elision and 
assimilation which occur in many languages are mostly 
post-lexical. For instance, English consonants, in particular 
alveolar ones, tend to assimilate to the place of articulation 
of the following consonant, even across a word boundary: 
[12.31] (a) bad boy 
(b) [baeb boi] 
good girl 
[gud gal] 
nice shoe 
[naij J"u] 
Elision of word final consonants is also common post-
lexically, especially where a word which ends in an alveolar 
consonant is immediately followed by a another 
word 
beginning with a consonant. This can be seen by contrasting 
the lexical and post-lexical forms in [12.32]: 
[12.32] (a) lexical representation 
best man 
/best maen/ 
round peg 
/raund peg/ 
hand grenade 
/haend graneid/ 
(b) post-lexical (connected speech) representation 
[bes maen] 
[raon peg] 
(—» [raum peg] 
if elision optionally feeds 
assimilation) 
[haen graneid] (—> [[risen graneid] 
if elision 
optionally 
feeds 
assimilation) 
An important difference between lexical and post-
lexical rules is that the former can take into account lexical 
bracketing: they are sensitive to word boundaries. We saw 
in the last chapter that lexical rules which assign stress to 
words may refer to the first or last or penultimate syllable 
as the case may be. Lexical rules can also look at word 
internal morphological bracketing introduced at the same 
pass through the lexicon - see the trisyllabic laxing rule in 
section 12.2.1 and Dahl's law in Kirundi which only applies 
when a prefix is immediately followed by a root (section 
5-4). 
But post-lexical rules cannot do that. They cannot refer 

278 Phonology in the wider context 
to word internal bracketing: they cannot refer to elements 
like 'stem' or 'affix' because each time lexical rules apply 
morphological bracketing relevant to their application is 
erased by the bracket erasure convention. Consequently, 
once we leave the lexicon we cannot have any access to the 
internal organisation of words. 
Another interesting difference between lexical and post-
lexical rules is that while the former always preserve the 
canonical morpheme structure of a language, post-lexical 
rules need not always do so. For instance, in a language 
where in the underlying representation all syllables and 
words end in vowels the output of a rule of lexical phon-
ology must be an open syllable. However, a post-lexical 
rule may create syllables which violate that condition. 
Syllable structure found in casual fast speech in many 
languages differs 
substantially from 
canonical syllable 
structure. 
Thus in English 'prohibited' consonant sequences may 
occur in the phonetic representation in these circumstances: 
underlying voiced consonants which occur in unstressed 
syllables may assimilate to an adjacent voiceless consonant 
and become voiceless when a weak [a] or [i] vowel 
following them is deleted. This process, which is especially 
common where grammatical words like the and of are 
present, may combine with consonant elision where appro-
priate, to create syllable structure which is radically different 
from the normal syllable structure of English. Consider 
these examples from Brown (1977: 69): 
[12.33] UR 
PR 
/'sauld 
ta Sa 
['sau/f0 'pAblik] 
'sold to the 
pAbhk/ 
public' 
/'bsegk av 'irjgbnd/ ['baeflkf 'iijgland] 
'Bank of 
England' 
/5a 'f3st 'raund/ 
['0f3s 'raund] 
'the first round' 
/'Saets 8anjuz/ 
['5sts6 'njuz] 
'that's the news' 
The consonant sequences U6, gfef, 0f and ts6 found in [12.33] 
are not typical of English. They are not allowed to follow 
a vowel in the same syllable in the underlying representation. 
Now take Luganda, a language where in lexical repre-
sentations all canonical syllables are open and where the 
only consonant sequences allowed are those where a nasal is 

Lexical phonology 279 
followed by another consonant, as in mbwa 'dog' or nte 
'cow'. Notwithstanding the fact that all canonical syllables 
are open, in fast, casual connected speech vowels can be 
optionally dropped, giving rise to a number of consonant 
clusters disallowed at the underlying level: 
[12.34] (a) lexical representation 
situka 
'stand up' 
fukamila 
'kneel down' 
kasikonda 
'hiccough' 
mafuta 
'oil' 
(b) post-lexical (connected speech) representation 
[stuka] 
'stand up' 
[ffeamira] 
'kneel down' 
[kajfeonda] 'hiccough' 
[mafta] 
'oil' 
The rule required states that vowels are optionally 
dropped between a voiceless fricative and a following voice-
less consonant. 
[12.35] V ^ 0 
+cont 
—son 
—voice 
—cont 
—voice 
Finally, note that while lexical rules are exception 
ridden, post-lexical rules are free from exceptions. Post-
lexical rules apply across the board wherever their structural 
description is met, without being subject to various restric-
tions. You can witness this by considering glottalisation of 
/t/ in non-standard British English or flapping of /t/ in 
American English (see [12.30] above). 
12.2.6. Summary 
I shall end ths part of the chapter with a summary based 
on Pulleyblank (1986): 
[12.36] 
(i) 
At each level (stratum), morphological 
rules are paired with phonological rules, 
(ii) Lexical rules are cyclic: the output of each 
set of word-formation rules is submitted 
to the phonological rules of that level. 
Furthermore, lexical rules only apply to 

280 Phonology in the wider context 
words formed at the pass through the 
lexicon at which they apply. 
(iii) The ordering of strata (levels) determines 
the sequencing of morphological processes 
in 
word-formation: 
level 
one 
rules 
precede level two rules; lexical rules 
precede post-lexical rules. 
(iv) The output of each lexical stratum of 
derivation is a word. 
(v) The inventory of lexical items of a 
language is the output of the morpho-
logical and phonological rules of the 
different levels put together. 
(vi) Post-lexical rules are not cyclic. 
(vii) 
A sharp distinction is drawn between 
LEXICAL and POST-LEXICAL rules. 
The former have access to word-internal 
structure, are structure preserving, cannot 
apply across word boundaries, 
apply 
cyclically and have exceptions; the latter 
have none of these properties. 
12.3 Prosodic domains 
We said above that post-lexical rules apply to the output of 
the syntax after words have been put together to form 
sentences. A key theoretical issue that arises concerns the 
precise nature of the syntactic information which post-
lexical phonological rules need to have access to. In SPE the 
assumption was that phonological rules apply to the output 
of the syntactic component without being sensitive to 
syntactic information; 
these two components of the 
grammar were thought to be independent of each other and 
to function without referring to each other closely. In recent 
years, however, that position has been called into question. 
Evidence has been amassed showing that there exists 
an intimate relationship between phonology and syntax. 
Post-lexical phonological rules need to know many things 
about syntactic structure since, in languages as diverse as 
Ewe, Italian, Spanish and Luganda, certain rules only apply 

Prosodic domains 281 
in specific synactic environments (Clements 1978; Nespor 
and Vogel 1982, 1986; Hyman et al. 1987). 
The two key issues are: 
(a) What syntactic properties are post-lexical phonological 
rules sensitive to? 
(b) In what form does phonology have access to those 
syntactic properties? 
For different languages different syntactic properties 
have been shown to play a role in phonology . Having 
recognised the relevance of syntactic information we could 
proceed to incorporate that information directly into the 
phonology using features like [+relative clause], [+impera-
tive], etc. But as the same syntactic features tend to recur 
in rule after rule in a particular language such a solution 
would fail to capture any important generalisations - it 
would be as unrevealing as it would be repetitive. 
That pitfall is avoided if we incorporate into phono-
logical theory PROSODIC DOMAINS within which 
phonological rules apply. Post-lexical rules would then refer 
to prosodic domains and not directly to syntactic features 
which determine them. 
In the case of English, Selkirk (1984: 26) suggests that 
the prosodic hierarchy includes at least the following 
categories: 
[12.37] 
Utterance 
(IP) (IP = Intonational Phrase) 
(PhP 
= Phonological Phrase) 
(Wd 
= Prosodic Word) 
(Ft 
= Foot) 
Syl 
Syl. 
(Syl 
= Syllable) 
Prosodic domain theory makes the prediction that the 
domains are arranged in a hierarchy which is strictly 

282 Phonology in the wider context 
adhered to. Domains never overlap. Lower domains are not 
allowed to include within them elements which belong to 
higher domains: lower domains form constituents of the 
higher ones, e.g. phonological phrases contain words; 
words contain feet; feet contain syllables. The reverse is not 
envisaged: syllables cannot contain feet, which in turn 
contain words, which contain phonological phrases. 
An introductory book of this kind is not the place to 
explore the complex topic of prosodic domains in depth. 
All I shall do is to briefly air some of the issues at stake. I 
shall do so by outlining the role of syntactically determined 
phonological phrase domains in the application of liaison in 
French. 
12.3.1 Prosodic domains and French liaison 
The essential principles of liaison in French were introduced 
in Chapter 9 (page 184). Recall that liaison occurs when a 
word ending in a consonant is followed by another word 
which begins with a vowel. Re-syllabification takes place 
so that the consonant becomes the onset and the vowel the 
nucleus of the new syllable. The effect of this is to preserve 
open, CV syllable structure as in [12.38a] where the article 
is followed by a vowel-commencing noun. But there is no 
liaison when the article is followed by a noun beginning 
with a consonant as in [12.38b]: 
[12.38] (a) le5 amis 
'the friends' 
le5 endroits 
'the places, spots' 
(b) les copains 
'the pals' 
les places 
'the places' 
Liaison (here marked by underlining the appropriate 
consonant and vowel) can take place in many other gram-
matical contexts as you can see below: 
[12.39] mow ami 
(Poss. + N) 
'my friend' 
en bort anglais (Prep. + Adj. 4- 'in good 
N) 
English' 
cet oMvrier 
(Dem. + N) 
'this worker' 
il es£ alle 
(Aux + V) 
'he is gone' 
It would be possible to formulate the rule in such a way that 
it makes direct reference to the relevant grammatical infor-

Conclusion 283 
mation, e.g. plural definite article followed by a noun, 
possessive followed by a noun, adjective followed by a 
noun etc. But that would miss the important generalisation 
that in all cases of liaison, the forms involved belong to the 
same phonological phrase (Selkirk 1978). 
Interestingly, the domain of the phonological phrase is 
syntactically determined. It is governed by X-bar syntax.6 
Liaison only applies where the appropriate consonant and 
vowel belong to the same major syntactic constituent, such 
as a noun phrase or verb group, whose elements share the 
same head. In [12.39] where the constructions in question 
belong to the same phonological phrase liaison occurs but 
in [12.40] where the potential candidates for liaison (marked 
below by = under the consonant) belong to different phono-
logical phrases, liaison fails to apply: 
[12.40] II part a six heures. 'He leaves at six o'clock' 
Est-ce le matin ou le 'Is 
it 
morning 
or 
soir? 
evening?' 
M. Dupont a deux 'Mr Dupont has two 
fils. 
sons' 
Jean etait ainsi occupe 'John was thus occupied' 
French liaison is not a rule that applies blindly 
anywhere. In addition to requiring the right segmental 
phonological input, it also requires that the sounds belong 
to the same phonological phrase domain. Membership of 
a phonological domain is in turn determined by X-bar 
syntax. Clearly, the relationship between phonology and 
syntax is intimate. 
12.4 Conclusion 
This introduction to modern phonological theory has not 
been completely impartial. My selection of topics has been 
influenced to some extent by my own interests and to a 
greater degree by the emerging consensus among generative 
phonologists over the last twenty years. I have made no 
attempt to compare the merits of alternative phonological 
theories. Others have done that. There are already several 
excellent surveys of twentieth century phonology available 

284 Phonology in the wider context 
(cf. Fischer-Jorgensen 1975; Sommerstein 1977; Anderson 
1985). 
My aim has not been to provide an encyclopedia of 
established phonological facts. The state of flux in which 
contemporary phonology finds itself precludes that. What 
I have attempted to do is to introduce you through the 
examination of a considerable amount of data from a wide 
range of languages, to one coherent model in which 
important phonological questions are being raised - and in 
a significant number of cases answered satisfactorily.

286 Phonology in the wider context 
Notes 
1. 
The vowel alternation between e ~ o is a historical relic 
which goes back all the way to Proto-Indo-European. 
The name for it is ABLAUT. It is found in other 
languages of this family e.g. Greek lego 'I read' but logos 
'word' and Latin tegere 'to cover' but toga 'toga i.e. 
outer garment' 
2. 
Halle and Mohanan (1985) have relaxed this restriction 
and allowed 'looping back' from a later stratum to an 
earlier one in a derivation in certain circumstances. 
3. 
If you can, now read Aronoff (1976: 7-17) for an 
elucidation of the concepts of 'word', 'morpheme' and 
'productivity'. 
4. 
The claim that level 1 affixes are always closer to the 
root than level 2 suffixes is probably too strong. There 
are cases where a level 2 affix is nearer to the root than 
a level 1 affix. For instance, in a word like desirability, 
the suffix -abil- which is a level 2 suffix (witness its 
semantic and phonological predictability) is closer to 
the root than -ity which is a level 1 suffix. We need to 
adopt a weaker position: in unmarked cases level 1 
affixes are nearer the root than level 2 affixes. 
5. 
The syntactic properties considered relevant to phon-
ology have included X-bar categories, traces, c-
command and labelled brackets carrying any syntactic 
features, e.g. definiteness, relative clause, past tense, 
which play a role in phonology (see Selkirk 1984, 
Hyman et al. 1987, Kaisse 1985, Nespor and Vogel 
1982, 1986). Labelled brackets offer the most flexible 
and at the same time least constrained way of incor-
porating syntactic information. Ideally their use should 
be curtailed. The concept of X-bar which is the one we 
shall be using in this book is explained in the note 
below. 
6. 
The phrasal categories within which liaison applies are 
known in syntax as X-bar domains. The head of any 
syntactic phrase (e.g. a noun phrase) is referred to as 
X. The phrasal category containing X (e.g. a noun) is 
called X (or X'), the phrasal category containing X is 

Conclusion 287 
in turn referred to as X (or X"). An example will 
clarify this. A phrase like a very clever idea can be 
represented thus: 
Determiner 
N 
Adj. Phrase 
N 
Degree 
Adj 
very 
clever 
idea 
As you can see X and X are 'projections' of X. By 
definition the head of a noun phrase must be N (a 
noun). There is an^intermediate category N which is 
contained in the N which corresponds to the noun 
phrase. The fact that features of X are projected 
throughout the phrasal domain of which it is head 
means that a language may not have a noun phrase 
which has a verb or preposition as its head. (See

The regular past tense is realised as: 
(i) /—id/ after a verb ending in /t/ or /d/ 
(ii) /—t/ after a verb ending in any voiceless segment 
except ft/ 
(iii) /—d/ elsewhere (i.e. after any voiced segment 
except /d/) 
(Note that this rule also applies to regular past 
participles 
e.g. a fitted ([(\tid\) carpet 
a padded ([p&did]) anorak 
armed ([amd]) forces 
a trapped ([trxpt]) 
animal). 
Both the past tense and the plural endings are subject 
to the same basic phonological principle of voice 
assimilation. In the case of the plural, an underlying 
alveolar fricative agrees in voicing with the last 
segment of the noun. In the case of the past tense 
suffix, the underlying alveolar stop agrees in voicing 
with the last segment of the verb. 
However, where the suffix is too similar to the 
root to which it is attached, a vowel ([i] or [a]) is 
inserted to separate the consonant of the suffix from 
that of the root. This happens when an alveolar sibilant 
([z] or [s]) representing the plural suffix (or the genitive 
suffix or the third person singular present tense marker) 
would be adjacent to another sibilant as in buses [bAS-
iz] (not *[6AS-.?]) or noses [naoz-iz] (not *[n3u^-z]). It 
also happens where an alveolar stop of the past tense 
(or past participle) ending would be next to another 
alveolar stop as in painted [peintid/ (not *[pein/-/]) or 
padded [paed-id/ (not 
*[pxd-d]).

Tairora (Papua New Guinea) (SIL: 1980: 39) 
(a) The sounds [1] and [r] are not distinct phonemes. They 
occur in complementary distribution and are allophones 
of the same phoneme: 
(i) [1] occurs before the back rounded vowels [u] and 
[o] (as in [bi'/o], ['bu/o], [a/Hke'/oma] and ['biri 
'timi/o]). 
(ii) [r] occurs elsewhere i.e. before any other vowel 
(as in [birdie], ['iria] [bi'reraBe ti'lo]). 
(b) [b] occurs word-initially and [B] between vowels within 
a word (as in [bi'Ba] and [bu'aaBa]). 
(c) Intervocalic position tends to be a weak position. In 
many languages consonants occurring in that environ-
ment are moved lower down the strength hierarchy. 
When flanked by vowels, stops often become fricatives. 
The phonetic basis of this phonomenon is simple: as 
vowels are made without obstructing the airstream in 
the oral tract, in order to minimise articulatory effort 
in the articulation of a consonant in inter-vocalic 
position (like the stop [b] in our example), it makes 
sense for a speaker not to form a strong obstruction of 
the airstream (which would have to be undone a few 
milliseconds later). Thus Tairora speakers will produce 
the bilabial fricative [B] in between vowels instead of 
the bilabial stop [b].

3. 
The addition of the genitive suffix has no effect on the 
final consonant of the noun. As here the genitive 
ending is attached to a root ending in a voiceless 
consonant, 
the allomorph 
of genitive 
morpheme 
selected as /—s/. This ensures agreement in voiceless-
ness between the suffix and the final root consonant. 
(The rule accounting for regular plural endings which 
was worked out on page 300, in the answer to question 
1 in Chapter 5, applies here as well.) 
In the plural, however, 
something 
unusual 
happens. The final labiodental fricative which is realised 
as voiceless [f] elsewhere in words like wife is realised 
as voiced [v] in wives and other words of this ilk. The 
form of the plural suffix selected in this case is predict-
ably /—z/. This ensures agreement with the voiced 
final consonant of the noun root. 
The process described above is not purely phon-
ological. Two suffixes which appear to be phonologi-
cally identical /—s/ trigger off different phonological 
alternations. In order to predict the behaviour of these 
suffixes it is necessary to take into account morphol-
ogical information as I have done above. The voicing 
of final fricatives before /—s/ is an idiosyncratic prop-
erty of the plural morpheme. It is not an automatic, 
natural phonological alternation.

1.(a)The rules needed are: 
(1) /d/ DELETION: d -> 0 / — C 
(In these compounds the final /d/ of the first 
word is deleted when the second part of the 
compound word begins with a consonant.) 
(ii) HOMORGANIC NASAL ASSIMILATION 
The nasal acquires the place of articulation of the 
following consonant: alveolar /n/ is realised as 
bilabial [m] to match the bilabial [b] that comes 
next. 
(The homorganic nasal assimilation rule is written 
formally in the answer to the next question.) 

304 Suggested answers to exercises 
(b) The first rule feeds the second one. If we assume 
extrinsic linear ordering, the deletion of /d/ must apply 
first, creating the input to homorganic nasal assimi-
lation rule. 
However, it is possible to handle this rule inter-
action without insisting on extrinsic linear ordering. 
Observe that until rule (i) has applied deleting /d/, the 
nasal is not adjacent to the initial consonant of the 
second word and cannot therefore assimilate to it. For 
both /d/ deletion and homorganic nasal assimilation to 
apply, universal principles require that / d / deletion 
precedes homorganic nasal assimilation since a rule 
cannot apply until its structural description is met. A 
feeding rule must apply before the rule whose appli-
cation it facilitates. No explicit linear ordering state-
ment is required. 
2. (a) Generative phonologists claim that differences between 
dialects of the same language can be attributed either, 
(i) to innovations in the rule system of one dialect 
which are not shared by other dialects or to the loss 
of a particular rule in some dialects, 
or 
(ii) to a change in the order in which the same rules 
are applied to the same underlying representations 
in different dialects. 
Any one of these factors will result in differ-
ences in the phonetic representation 
(Kiparsky 
1968). 
The Lumasaaba data exemplify innovation in 
the rule system. We can set up / i N - / as the under-
lying representation of the noun class prefix. The 
same form would also serve as the underlying rep-
resentation of the first person singular personal pro-
noun. The differences in the phonetic manifestation 
of the prefixes are due to the rules stated below:

In dialect A the underlying nasal shares the place 
of articulation of the following consonant (see 
impiso, intemu, ijicese and igkafu). 
Dialect B as well has the homorganic nasal assimi-
lation rule. Its effects can be seen where the root 
begins with a voiced consonant (see [imbeba, 
iggwe, indimal]). 
However, in dialect B, if the root begins with a 
voiceless consonant (as in [iitemu, iijula, iikuba]) 
two additional rules come into play. They are 
nasal deletion and compensatory lengthening of 
the vowel preceding the deleted nasal,

V 
*- [+long] / _ N 
(iii) NASAL DELETION 
+cons 
—voice 
N 
^ 0 
/_ 
+cons 
—voice. 
Rules (ii) and (iii) are an innovation in dialect B. They 
are absent from dialect A. 
(c) First, observe that rule (iii) bleeds rule (i) in dialect B. 
Nasals are deleted before voiceless consonants. This 
deprives the homorganic nasal assimilation rule of some 
of its input. As we have already seen, in this dialect 
homorganic nasal assimilation is restricted to roots 
commencing with voiced consonants 
Secondly, if extrinsic ordering is assumed, rule (iii) 
cannot apply before rule (ii) because, if it did, it would 
remove the nasal whose presence is required by the 
compensatory lengthening rule. 
But extrinsic ordering of these last two rules is not 
essential. If we stipulate that rules apply at the earliest 
opportunity when their structural description is satis-
fied, both (ii) and (iii) can apply directly and simul-
taneously to the underlying representation since at that 
point the structural description of both rules is satisfied.

(c) 
I.(a)The plural morpheme has the shapes [i], [e] and [e]. 
(b) The underlying representations of the noun roots are: 
(a) abd

luo 
'stick'

'hill' 
ko8 
'rain' 
guog 
'dog' 
(b) lep 
'tongue' 
lak 
'tooth' 
adit 
'basket' 
I have posited as underlying the consonants that 
appear in the plural form of the noun rather than those 
which occur in the singular form because this allows 
us greater generality. The solution I am suggesting 
requires an obstruent devoicing rule which changes 
underlying voiced obstruents into voiceless obstruents 
in the data in (a). Obviously, the devoicing rule has no 
effect on the underlying voiceless obstruents in (b). 
If, instead, we assumed that the words in 1. (a) end 
in a voiceless obstruent which becomes voiced when 
it occurs between vowels as a result of the addition of 
the plural ending, we would be unable to explain why 
our voicing rule fails to apply to the words in (b). They 
would have to be marked as exceptions. This solution 
is to be rejected in favour of the more general first 
alternative. 
The devoicing rule which I propose can be written 
thus: 
+cons 
—son 
+voice 
[" -voice • ] / _ # 
The voicing rule which I reject would be written thus: 
-> [+voice] /V _ V

voiceless obstruents like those in (b). In other words, 
the opposition between voiced and voiceless obstruents 
is NEUTRALISED (i.e. SUSPENDED) in word final 
position. For a better known example of the neutral-
isation of the voicing opposition see the Turkish data 
in [6.7] on page 103.

[n] before roots commencing with velars 
(b) [mbusi], [ndeBe] 
(c) The rule in question is homorganic nasal assimilation. 
Proposing a rule is preferable to making a list because 
it allows us to capture the generalisation that in Luyia 
nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the 
following consonant.

(g) All the rules above except one are mutually non-
affecting. The order in which they apply makes no 
difference. The only case where the order is relevant 
is the last two examples. 
Since the nasal prefix surfaces as a palatal nasal 
although the initial nasal of the root is absent from the 
phonetic representation in class 9, we can assume that 
the rule of homorganic assimilation applies when the 
palatal sonorants / j / and /ji/ are still present. The dele-
tion of /']/ and /ji/ must apply after homorganic nasal 
assimilation. If we tried to apply palatal sonorant dele-
tion before homorganic nasal assimilation, the deriva-
tion would abort because the palatal nasal which 
conditions the homorganic nasal assimilation rule 
would be missing.

Remarks: 
(a) Diphthongs and affricates are complex elements. In a 
diphthong (e.g. /ai/ as in fright) two segments with 
different phonetic properties occupy a single V slot. 
Likewise, with affricates like /d3/ in juxtapose a single 
C slot is occupied by two consonantal segments. 
(b) Knesset and Gdansk are foreign words which have an 
initial consonant sequence that does not fit in the 
English syllable template: /kn/ and /gd/ are not 
permissible syllable onsets in English. The consonants 
/k/ and /g/ are EXTRASYLLABIC. In speech the 
transition from the extrasyllabic consonant to the next 
consonant may involve the insertion of a short voiceless 
[a]. (See Clements and Keyser 1983: 39-40) Knesset and 
Gdansk have syllable trees in which the initial [k] and 
[g] respectively are unlinked to any syllable node. 
The syllabification principles in [9.10] need to be 
amended to allow underlying consonants, in excep-
tional circumstances, to be unlinked to any syllable 
node. 
2. 
Syllable formation rules may need to take into account 
segment type. There may be restrictions on the conso-
nant or vowel segments which can fill a particular C 
or V slot. In our data we have this pattern of

The plural definite article /lez/ contains an underlying 
final jzj which only surfaces when it is followed by a 
vowel (as in les animaux [lez animo]) and is deleted in 
preconsonantal position (as in les dames [le dam]). We 
can 
assume 
that 
this consonant 
is 
underlyingly 
EXTRAMETRICAL. It cannot be pronounced unless 
it gets associated to a syllable node during a derivation. 
French being a language which generally prefers open 
syllables, in cases where the extrasyllabic consonant is 
followed by a consonant it is deleted:

But when the extrasyllabic consonant is followed by 
a vowel it is preserved. It is linked by the liaison rule 
to the syllable node to its right and functions as a 
syllable onset. This is shown by the broken line drawn 
between /z/ and the syllable node dominating /a/:

I.(a)In the Bekwarra data tone has a lexical function. There 
are no minimal pairs distinguished soley by pitch but 
at the same time it would not be possible to predict the 
pitch that occurs in a given position in a word. The 
examples contain many near minimal pairs. We can 
recognise high ('), mid (—) and low (N) tone as 
phonemic using the principle of contrast in analogous 
environments on the basis of pairs like: 
[6ku] ~ [uko], 
[Ige] ~ [Ije] 
[ide] ~ [ine] 
[ubii] ~ [upu] 
[api] ~ [abi] 
[ubi/ ~ [abi] 
(b) The data shows that Bekwarra is a register tone 
language. All the tones have level high, mid or low 
pitch. There are no rising or falling contour tones. 
2. 
(i) The following 
tonal alternations are observed 
(based on Elimelech 1976): 
L-L° vs L-H 
(cf. ele° 'tree' vs ele ndira 'that's a tree') 
H-D vs H-H 
(cf. cele 'sand' vs cele ndira 'that's sand') 
F-L vs H-L 
(cf. ku6a 'chicken' vs ku6andira 'that's a chicken') 
H-F-L vs L-L-L 
(cf. ibumu 'belly' vs ibumu ndijira 'that's a belly') 
L-L-L° vs L-L-H 
(cf. 6iji5ni° 'bird' Bijioni ndiBira 'that's a bird') 
L-H-D vs L-H-H ^ 
(cf. lkayi 'leaf vs lkayi ndijira 'that's a leaf) 
L-F-L vs L-H-L 
(cf. ilali 'stone' vs ilali ndijira 'that's a stone') 
The L-L of ta6a 'goat' and the L-F of ih 'ear' do not 
alternate. 
(ii) In underlying representations only high and low 
tones contrast in Kombe. The rules below derive 
falling tone (F), unreleased low tone (L°) and 
downstep high tone (D). 
Falling tone 
The F occurs in penultimate position before a L 
tone followed by a pause as in: 

Suggested answers to exercises 313 
kuba 'chicken' a toyendi 
'he saw a chicken' 
kuba 
ilali 'stone' 
a toyendi 
'he saw a stone' 
ilali 
Where these nouns occur phrase medially the F 
tone is simplified to H. This is the case in the 
identification construction: 
ku6a 'chicken' ku6andira 
'that's a chicken' 
ilali 'stone' 
ilali ndijira 'that's a stone' 
Falling tones are derived from underlying high 
tones by a rule which spreads the L tone in pre-
pausal position to the preceding vowel: 
UR 
"H 
L 
_V 
V # #_ 
PR 
"H 
L 
N 
V 
V # 
# 
As a result of this rule, the first vowel is simul-
taneously associated with a high and a low tone. 
This makes it a falling tone. 
Unreleased low tone (L°) 
L° occurs word finally after a L and followed by 
a pause: 
ele° 
'tree' a toyendi ele° 
'he saw a tree' 
Bijioni0 'bird' a toyendi Birjoni0 'he saw a bird' 
But when the relevant nouns occur in phrase 
medial position, instead of L° we find a H tone: 
ele° 
'tree' 
ele 
ndira 
'that's a tree' 
Bijioni0 
'bird' 
Bijioni 
ndiBira 
'that's a bird' 
We shall therefore assume that L° tone is derived 
from an underlying H. A high tone is lowered 
to L° when preceded by L and followed by a 
pause. 
L H 
V 
V # # 
_^ 
L H 
N

The L tone spreads from the first vowel to the 
second. Interestingly, in the phonetic represen-
tation the language distinguishes these derived 

314 Suggested answers to exercises 
unreleased (non-falling) low tones from falling 
low tones which come from underlying low 
tones (see taba). 
Downstep tone 
Downstep is restricted to final syllables of nouns: 
cele r 'sand' 
a toyendi cele T 'he saw sand' 
ikayi 
'leaf 
a toyendi ikayi 'he saw a leaf 
Always D is preceded by H and followed by a 
pause. D does not occur when a noun is inside 
a phrase: 
file 
'sand' 
cele 
ndira 
'that's sand' 
ikayi 
'leaf 
ikayi 
ndijira 
'that's a leaf 
The rule stating that underlying H becomes D 
when it is preceded by H and followed by a 
pause is given below (with #

apply within a phonological phrase. 
Chapter 11 
I.(a) Stress placement in Arabic is sensitive to syllable 
weight. A syllable with a short vowel (CV) followed 
by nothing is light. But a syllable containing a long 
vowel (CV:) or a short vowel followed by at least one 
consonant (CVC) is heavy. Furthermore, a word final 
consonant is extrametrical and does not 
contribute 
anything to the weight of a syllable. So, CVC syllables 
in word final position are light. In that position only 
C V C C syllables and syllables with long vowels count 
as heavy. 
The Arabic stress rule is reminiscent of the Latin 

Suggested answers to exercises 315 
w 
stress rule: stress falls on the first heavy syllable, 
counting from the right-hand end of the word. In a 
disyllabic word with no heavy syllables stress goes on 
the initial (penultimate) syllable. In longer words with 
no heavy syllable stress goes on the antepenultimate 
syllable. The operation of this rule is shown below in 
(b). 
Metrical trees to show where stress falls in the words: 
kdtab, kdtabu, kdtabit, katdbt, katdbti, lamuuna and lamundat 
are shown below. (Note that it makes no difference 
whether trees are drawn above the words as I did in 
the text of Chapter 9 or below the word as I have done 
here.) 
(a) ka - ta(b) 
The final consonant is extrametrical. 
Therefore the final syllable is light 
although it ends in a consonant. It 
is skipped over. Stress goes on the 
first syllable. 
ta - bi(t) Final /t/ is extrametrical. In a word 
ta - bu of more than two syllables, where 
as here, none of the syllables is 
heavy, stress goes on the antepenul-
timate syllable. 
Stress is on the heavy CVC or CV: 
syllable in penultimate position. 
(d) la - mil - naa(t) Even though the final /t/ is extra-
metrical, the last syllable is still 
heavy (CV:). As it contains a long 
vowel it receives the stress. 
Ngiyamba (Australia) (Based on Donaldson 1980) 
The most salient characteristics of Ngiyamba stress are 
summarised in this section. 
(i) This language has a quantity sensitive metrical 
structure, with the left-hand dominant. Primary 
stress falls on the initial syllable if a word contains 
no long vowels or on the heavy syllable (with a 

316 Suggested answers to exercises 
long vowel) nearest to the beginning of a word, 
if there is one. 
(ii) The assignment of secondary stress is subject to a 
rhythm rule requiring an alternating stress pattern. 
On the one hand, adjacent syllables cannot receive 
stress even where they otherwise qualify to bear 
it, and on the other hand, no more than two 
unstressed syllables can occur in a sequence. 
(iii) Any word-final syllable is extrametrical. It is 
'invisible' to stress rules - unless it contains a long 
vowel, 
(b) The following analysis, based on Donaldson (1980: 42) 
informally exemplifies Ngiyamba stress rules: 
STRESS RULE 1: PRIMARY STRESS IN ROOTS 
(i) If a root contains no heavy syllable (with a long 
vowel), primary word stress falls on the first 
1 
syllable (as in girala). 
(ii) If a word contains a heavy syllable, primary word 
stress falls on the first heavy syllable, i.e. the 
3 
1 
syllable containing a long vowel (as in gabadai-ga, 
3 
1 
3 
1 
gabadai-bidi and binjdju-binjdjuiri-nji). 
(iii) In a trisyllabic root without long vowels, if the 
final syllable is open and a monosyllabic final 
suffix with a short vowel follows, primary stress 
1 
falls on the second syllable, as in girbadja-gu and 
1 
bayirga-gu. 
STRESS 
RULE 
2: SECONDARY 
STRESS 
IN 
SUFFIXES 
(i) Secondary stress falls on each (heavy) syllable con-
taining a long vowel in each suffix so long as no 
adjacent syllables are stressed. 
(ii) If a suffix has no long vowel, and has more than 
one syllable, stress falls on the first syllable. This is 
an ITERATIVE rule. It applies to each suffix in 
turn, starting with the first to be affixed to the 
root, provided that none of the general constraints 
mentioned above is violated. For instance, the rule 

Suggested answers to exercises 317 
does not apply in cases where it would otherwise 
place a secondary stress adjacent to a root-final syll-
i 
able with primary stress as in gabadai-bidi, or to a 
suffix-final syllable with secondary stress, as in 
i 
2 
yana-wa-ga\-giri. 
STRESS RULE 3: SECONDARY STRESS IN ROOT 
(i) Secondary stress falls on the first syllable of a root 
if primary stress falls on some other syllable than 
3 
1 
the first or second (adjacent) syllable, as in gabadai-
3 
1 
3

ga, gabadai-bidi and binjdju-binjdjw.ri-nji. 
(ii) Secondary stress falls on alternate syllables of the 
root to the right of the syllable carrying primary 
1 3 
stress, as in giralan-ga unless this would result in 
two adjacent syllables being stressed. The effect of

this constraint can be seen in giralam-bidi and

1. 
We assume that the irregular plural formation processes 
in (a)-(c) take place at level 1. In order to qualify for 
any one of these ways of forming the plural, a noun 
must be expressly marked [+ rule a] to show that it 
undergoes the rule which 'replaces' the singular ending 
-um with the plural ending -a, or [+ rule b] which 
'replaces' the singular ending -us with the plural ending 
-1 or [+ rule c] which causes the internal vowel change 

318 Suggested answers to exercises 
/ao/ —> /ai/. Any of these level I rules BLOCKS the 
application of the later level 2 regular plural formation 
rule exemplified in (d). Having been already inflected 
for plural at level 1, the forms in (a)-(c) cannot subse-
quently undergo the regular level 2 rule. 
2. 
Kimatumbi (Based on Odden 1987) 
(a) Shortening is a POST-LEXICAL rule. It applies after 
words have been put together by the syntax to form 
phrases. 
(b) Shortening in Kimatumbi only applies within a single 
X-bar domain. 
(i) A long vowel in a noun stem is shortened if the 
stem is the head of the noun phrase and occurs in 
phrase medial position. This is illustrated by the 
data in (a), 
(ii) Shortening fails to apply if the noun is not immedi-
ately followed by a modifier within the noun 
phrase of which it is the head. 
Thus in (b) shortening fails because the noun 
is followed by a verb phrase (chaapuwaaniike) or 
by a noun which is not in the same NP 
(Mamboondo). 
Likewise, in (c) the long vowel is shortened 
in the first example where [kjkolombe kikulu]NP 
is 
a 
single 
noun 
phrase 
whose 
head 
is 
[kikoloombe] but shortening is blocked in the 
second example where the same words are 
adjacent to each other but do not belong to the 
same noun phrase: [kjkoloombe]Ni> [0kikulu]NP. 
This shows that it is constituent structure rather 
than lexical category or grammatical agreement 
that determines the applicability of the short-
ening rule. 
Finally, in (d) we can see that shortening 
only applies to a noun which is the head of a 
noun phrase. Thus, the long vowels of the 
adjective kikeele and the possessive yaangu fail to 
shorten when they occur in phrase medial posi-
tion.

The English glottaHsation rule applies to /t/ when it

button and post-lexically as in let it in.
