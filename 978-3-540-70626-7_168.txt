Quantum Interrogation
Paul G. Kwiat
The notion of a “negative-result” measurement was ﬁrst discussed by Renninger [1]
and later by Dicke [2]. As a simple example, consider a single photon incident on
a beamsplitter, with a 100% efﬁcient detector in the reﬂected port; if we somehow
know that the photon amplitude has already encountered the detector, and yet no
detection has taken place, then this non-detection certainly “collapses” the original
superposition of the photon  wave function solely into the transmitted path. Elitzur
and Vaidman (EV) [3] suggested a modiﬁed system in which a second beamsplit-
ter is used to recombine the two paths (see Fig. 1). In the absence of any object in
one arm of the interferometer, complete destructive interference of the two paths
leads to a zero probability that a detector at one of the ports ﬁres. On the other
hand, the presence of a non-transmitting object necessarily inhibits the destructive
interference (as there is then only one path by which the photon can reach the recom-
bining beamsplitter) so that sometimes this “dark” detector will ﬁre. This indicates
the presence of the object, even though the detected photon most certainly did not
travel the path containing the object, in essence an “interaction-free” measurement.1
( Interaction-free Measurement)
This simple scheme was experimentally veriﬁed using single photons ( light
quantum) (conditionally prepared via parametric down-conversion), achieving a
1 We prefer the more general term “quantum interrogation”, which allows for the possibility that
the photon does pass through the path with the object, e.g., if the object is semi-transparent or only
partially blocks the arm of the interferometer.

Fig. 1 (a). In the absence of an object in the interferometer, each incident photon is detected at
D1, i.e., D2 never ﬁres. (b). A non-transmitting object disrupts the interference, so D2 now receives
photons, unambiguously indicating the presence of the object, even though any detected photon
must have taken the bottom path in the interferometer. (c). Varying the beamsplitter reﬂectivities
enables one to optimize the efﬁciency, approaching the 50% limit possible with this technique (data
from [5])
∼33% efﬁciency for detecting the presence of an opaque object in an interaction-
free way [4]. Another experiment veriﬁed that by adjusting the reﬂectivity of the
interferometer beamsplitters, one could achieve an efﬁciency approaching 50%
(Fig. 1c), and by incorporating a focused beam, demonstrated the basic elements
of a reduced-absorption imaging method [5]. Similar quantum interrogation experi-
ments have now been performed with neutrons [6] and even proposed as a means to
read out superconducting qubits without any energy exchange [7].
Although it was originally thought that 50% efﬁciency was the best one could
achieve, in fact a method based on the  quantum Zeno effect (QZE) allows much
better performance: In principle in a lossless setup, one can detect the presence of a
non-transmitting object all the time, with no chance of absorption by the object! The
basic idea of the QZE [8] is that repeated strong measurements of a quantum system
can continually project it into its initial state, thereby inhibiting the otherwise slow
evolution out of this state. As a simple example, consider the arrangement shown
in Fig. 2a. A single photon with initial horizontal polarization is cycled N times
through a Michelson interferometer (with a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS)). In each
cycle, a waveplate is used to rotate the polarization by a small amount θ = π/2N.
In the absence of an object in the interferometer, the photon polarization rotates
stepwise from horizontal to vertical. On the other hand, the presence of a non-
transmitting object in the vertical polarization arm of the interferometer will inhibit

Fig. 2 (a). Conceptual scheme incorporating the quantum Zeno effect to realize high-efﬁciency
quantum interrogation. An initially horizontally (H) polarized photon is allowed to circulate N
times (experiencing a rotation by π/2N each cycle) before being removed and its polarization an-
alyzed. In the absence of the object, the photon will have vertical (V) polarization. In the presence
of an object in the V arm, the ﬁnal polarization of the photon will be H, with a negligibly small
probability the photon is absorbed. (b). Plot of efﬁciency vs. number of cycles for ideal lossless
system (solid curve), and one with ∼95% loss (dashed curve), corresponding to experimental data

this evolution. Now after N cycles, the photon has a high probability cos2N(π/2N)
of still being horizontally polarized. As N becomes very large (and the correspond-
ing effective coupling between the horizontal and vertical-polarization arms of the
interferometer becomes very small) the probability that the photon remains in its
initial horizontal polarization state approaches 1, while the probability the photon is
ever absorbed by the object approaches zero.2 Therefore, by simply observing the
ﬁnal state of the polarization of the photon one can determine in an interaction-free
way whether or not there was a (non-transmitting) object present. Such a scheme
has been implemented [9], achieving efﬁciencies of ∼75%.
A related method involves shining monochromatic light into a highly resonant
optical cavity, with mirrors of very high reﬂectivity R ≈1 −ε. In the absence of
any object in the interferometer, the incident ﬁeld will, after a transient period, expe-
rience full constructive interference for transmission, i.e., essentially all the incident
light will be transmitted. On the other hand, if there is an opaque object in the cavity,
this will prevent the necessary coherent build up of ﬁelds that would otherwise lead
to destructive interference for reﬂection off the entrance mirror; now the incident
light simply bounces off the cavity, with probability R. Thus, detection of a reﬂected
(transmitted) photon indicates the presence (absence) of a non-transmitting object
in the cavity. Such a scheme has been experimentally realized [10], achieving an
interaction-free detection probability up to 88%. By using a scanning system, one
can also generalize this technique to 2-D imaging; in particular, Inoue and Bjork
were able to “image” the silhouette of a piece of ﬁlm without exposing the ﬁlm
itself [11].
2 The presence of loss in the rest of the system actually prevents one from reaching the limit
N →∞, so in any real system the maximum efﬁciency is strictly <1.

Quantum Interrogation
One topic of interest is whether or not the quantum interrogation techniques can
be useful when the object is partially transmitting; certainly any sort of imaging
would be much more valuable if a “grayscale” for absorption could be obtained.
By making enough measurements, it is always possible to distinguish between a
transparent object and one with some absorption – multiple passes through the latter
object cause it to effectively look more opaque [12]. However, in general two partial
transparencies cannot be perfectly distinguished [13].
Finally, one of the more intriguing applications of the methods of quantum inter-
rogation is to the topic of  quantum computation. Mitchison and Jozsa [14] showed
that if one can put a quantum computer into a superposition of “running” and “not
running”, it is possible to gain information about the result even in instances when
the algorithm did not run – a “counterfactual quantum computation” (CFQC). The
mere fact that the computer could have run is enough to disrupt interference (in
the same way that the presence of an opaque object disrupts the interference in
Fig. 1). This EV-style approach has been experimentally realized [15] using a sim-
ple beamsplitter to put an incident photon into a superposition of passing through
or not passing through an optical implementation of Grover’s search algorithm [16]
( quantum computation); an efﬁciency – likelihood of a CFQC – of 32% was at-
tained. Although the original method only works a fraction of the time and only on
certain possible results, a more complicated system based on the QZE approach –
many weak measurements ( weak value and weak measurements) – was predicted
to again recover high efﬁciencies [15].

Quantum Jump Experiments
Howard J. Carmichael
The notion of  quantum jumps entered quantum physics in 1913, in the year Niels
Bohr (1885–1962) proposed a quantized model of the  Rutherford atom and a
prescription for obtaining the Rydberg formula for the emission spectrum of atomic
hydrogen  Bohr’s atom model. It is inherent in the simple relation [1]
Wτ2 −Wτ1 = hν,
which equates a difference in electron binding energies in initial and ﬁnal atomic
stationary states to the energy of an emitted quantum of radiation of frequency ν.
Atomic stationary states are labeled by an integer τ, and Bohr speaks of “the pass-
ing of the system from a state corresponding to τ = τ1 to one corresponding to
τ = τ2”; this passing is the quantum jump, Planck’s constant and it proceeds with
the emission of a quantum of radiation of energy hν, where h is  Planck’s constant;
the reverse jump accompanies absorption. In 1916 Einstein (1879–1955) raised the
quantum jump to the level of a genuine principle of quantum dynamics. By propos-
ing probabilistic rules for the absorption and emission (spontaneous and stimulated)
of radiation quanta, Einstein managed to arrive at a dynamical explanation of the
Planck formula for the spectrum of  black-body radiation [2]. This so-called A and
B theory [13, 14] continues in wide use today, providing the basis for rate-equation
models of the interaction of light and quantized matter; although, its founding upon
the quantum jump, adopted as a fundamental event, is superceded by the quantum
mechanics of Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) and Heisenberg (1901–1976).
