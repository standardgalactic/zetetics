        Edvard Chubaryan, theoretical physicist, one of the founders of the Armenian 
school of physics of superdense celestial bodies, Honored Scientist, Academician 
of NAS of Armenia, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor, 
Head of the Theoretical Physics Department of Yerevan State University, 
celebrated his 75th anniversary. 
        Professor Edvard Chubaryan was born on May 5, 1936. In 1953 he left school 
 20 named after Dzerzhinsky with honors and gold medal. In the same year he 
entered the Department of Physics of Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of 
Yerevan State University. Still a student he was actively engaged in research work. 
His first scientific paper, which became his thesis was devoted to the question of 
parity violation in the processes of Œ≤ -decay - a very topical issue in the 1950s. 
After graduating from the University, in 1958-1961 E. Chubaryan continued his 
postgraduate studies at the Department of Theoretical Physics. After defending his 
PhD dissertation in 1964 he began working at the same department, first as a senior 
lecturer, from 1967 - as an Associate professor and since the defense of his 
doctorial dissertation in 1972 he is a professor of the Department of Theoretical 
Physics. 
       Edvard Chubaryan‚Äôs scientific research is devoted to thermodynamics of 
degenerate superdense matter and the theory of superdense celestial bodies, whose 
bases in the early 1960s were laid by academicians Victor Hambartsumyan and 
Gurgen Sahakian. For his research work in this field in 1970 Edvard Chubaryan 
together with Davit Sedrakyan and Vladimir Papoyan was awarded the  Prize of 
Lenin Komsomol. 
       In subsequent years Edvard Chubaryan together with the staff members of the 
Department of Theoretical Physics carried out a series of works devoted to the 
theory of pulsars, rotating magnetized neutron stars. 
      There is every reason to believe that in the case of extremely strong 
gravitational fields, Einstein's general theory of relativity needs substantial 
clarification. On this basis there have been a number of attempts at the Department 
of Theoretical Physics to study alternative theories of gravitation. In this respect 
Edvard Chubaryan‚Äôs input into the development of bimetric  gravitational theory, 
Kaluza-Klein‚Äôs  projective theory and others is very important. 
      A number of significant problems were solved within the framework of 
bimetric theory of gravitation. In particular, it has been shown how to self-
consistently determine the background and a curved metrics. With prof. 
Chubaryan‚Äôs direct participation models of static spherical as well as those of 
stationary rotating stellar configurations were built, their integral parameters ‚Äì  
 
7 

 weight, size, quadrupole moments, etc. ‚Äì were calculated in the framework of  
bimetric gravitational theory. The analytic vacuum solution of the field equations 
of the bimetric gravitational theory has been found, which is unique in scientific 
literature.  
       Edvard. Chubaryan is the author of over 140 scientific papers published in 
national and international journals. They were presented at many conferences, 
symposia, and received recognition of the scientific community. 
       E. Chubaryan is one of the authors (with G. Sahakian) of the textbook 
"Quantum Mechanics" in Russian and Armenian languages, co-author of Collected 
Problems in Theoretical Physics, as well as of the Collected Problems in Physics 
for University entrants. 
       E.Chubaryan plays a major role in the education of qualified physicists. He 
teaches a course in "Quantum Mechanics", as well as special courses in theoretical 
physics at the Faculty of Physics. Six PhD theses were defended under his 
supervision. From 1991 to 2006, Professor E. Chubaryan, being the vice-rector of 
Yerevan State University for Natural Sciences, devoted much attention to the 
organization of educational process and actively participated in the reform of 
university education. 
        One cannot but mention his significant role in the formation and development 
of the Ijevan branch of Yerevan State University. The school education has not 
been left unattended either. E. Chubaryan was chairman of the educational-
methodical council in physics of the USSR Ministry of Education, the chairman of 
the jury of Republican school Olympiads in physics, and in 1984 the chairman of 
All-Union School Olympiad jury. On his initiative in secondary schools, 
particularly in schools with physical and mathematical bias, extensive work was 
carried out to identify the gifted students. 
       Professor Chubaryan‚Äôs role in building up and strengthening the scientific 
links between the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna, Russia) and the 
Physics Department of Yerevan State University is also noteworthy. Up to now 
graduates of the Faculty of Physics, Yerevan State University, specialists in 
Nuclear and Theoretical Physics, work at this Institute. 
      In addition to the fruitful scientific and pedagogical activity E. Chubaryan takes 
an active part in public activities. He is a board member of the Problem-solving 
Council in Physics of NAS of Armenia, a member of specialized councils for 
defense of doctoral dissertations, a member of the Academic Councils of Yerevan 
State University and of the Faculty of Physics. 
      Edvard Chubaryan, an honest, direct and humble scientific worker, enjoys the 
confidence and affection of his students and colleagues. The hero of the day is full 
of strength, vigour and willingness to work actively. This is evidenced by the fact 
that during the last two years he substantially revised and republished the textbook 
"Quantum Mechanics" and "Problems in quantum mechanics." 
       Our congratulations to Professor Chubaryan. We wish him health, longevity 
and success in all his future endeavors.

Abstract
Integrable multidimensional models of gravitation and cosmology make up
one of the proper approaches to study basic issues and strong Ô¨Åeld objects, the
Early and present Universe and black hole physics in particular [1, 2, 3]. Our
main results within this approach are described both for cosmology and for BH
physics. Problems of the absolute G measurements and its possible time and
range variations are reÔ¨Çections of the uniÔ¨Åcation problem.
The choice, nature, classiÔ¨Åcation and precision of determination of funda-
mental physical constants and also their role in expected transfer to new def-
initions of main units of SI , supposed to be based on fundamental physical
constants and stable quantum phenomena are described. The problem of tem-
poral variations of constants is also discussed, temporal and range variations of
G in particular. A need for further absolute measurements of G, its possible
range and time variations is pointed out. The multipurpose space project SEE
is shortly described, aimed for measuring G and its stability in space and time
3-4 orders better than at present. It may answer many important questions
posed by gravitation, cosmology and uniÔ¨Åed theories. Laboratory experiment
project to test possible deviations from the Newton Law is presented also.
1. Introduction
Gravitation as a fundamental interaction that governs all phenomena at large
and very small scales, but still not well understood at a quantum level, is a missing
cardinal link to uniÔ¨Åcation of all physical interactions.Discovery of present accel-
eration of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy problems are also a great
challenge to modern physics, which may bring to a new revolution in it. Studies in
the previous century in the Ô¨Åeld of gravitation were devoted mainly to theoretical
investigations and experimental veriÔ¨Åcation of general relativity and alternative the-
ories of gravitation with a strong stress on relations between macro and microworld
phenomena or, in other words, between classical gravitation and quantum physics.
9

As a motivation there were: singularities in cosmology and black hole physics, role
of gravity at large and very small (planckian) scales, attempts to create a quantum
theory of gravity as for other physical Ô¨Åelds, problem of possible variations of fun-
damental physical constants etc. A lot of work was done in our group [4] along such
topics as :
- exact solutions with diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Åelds as sources in GR,
- particle-like solutions with a gravitational Ô¨Åeld,
- quantum theory of Ô¨Åelds in a classical gravitational background,
- quantum cosmology with Ô¨Åelds like a scalar one, with the cosmological constant
etc.,
- self-consistent treatment of quantum eÔ¨Äects in cosmology,
- development of alternative theories of gravitation: scalar-tensor, with extra
dimensions etc.,
- possible variations of fundamental physical constants [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
As our main results of this period one may mention [4] the Ô¨Årst quantum cos-
mological model with a cosmological constant (creation from nothing) (1972); Ô¨Årst
classical models for conformal scalar Ô¨Åeld (1968) and quantum cosmological mod-
els with minimal and conformal scalar Ô¨Åelds (1971), Ô¨Årst nonsingular cosmological
model with spontaneous symmetry breaking (1978-79) of the nonlinear conformal
scalar Ô¨Åeld, exact solutions for nonlinear electrodynamics, including Born-Infeld one,
Ô¨Årst exact solution for dilaton-type interaction with electro-magnetic Ô¨Åeld in GR.
First non-singular Ô¨Åeld particle-like solution with gravitational Ô¨Åeld (1979). Also,
the conclusion that only G may vary with respect to atomic system of measurements
in Brans-Dicke frame (1978).
As all attempts to quantize general relativity in a usual manner failed and it was
proved that it is not renormalizable, it became clear that the promising trend is along
the lines of uniÔ¨Åcation of all physical interactions which started in the 70‚Äôs. About
this time the experimental investigation of gravity in strong Ô¨Åelds and gravitational
waves started giving a powerful speed up in theoretical studies of such objects as
pulsars, black holes, QSO‚Äôs, AGN‚Äôs, early Universe etc., which continues now.
In experimental activities some crucial next generation gravitational experiments
verifying predictions of uniÔ¨Åed schemes will be important. Among them are: STEP
- testing the corner stone Equivalence Principle, SEE - testing the inverse square
law (or new non-Newtonian interactions), EP, possible variations of the newtonian
constant G with time, measurements of the absolute value of G with unprecedented
accuracy [10, 11]. Of course, gravitational waves problem, veriÔ¨Åcation of torsional,
rotational, 2nd order and strong Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äects remain important also.
Other very important feature, which may be envisaged, is an increasing role of
fundamental physics studies, gravitation, cosmology and astrophysics in particular,
in space experiments [12]. Unique microgravity environments and modern technol-
ogy outbreak give nearly ideal place for gravitational experiments which suÔ¨Äer a
lot on Earth from its relatively strong gravitational Ô¨Åeld and gravitational Ô¨Åelds of
nearby objects due to the fact that there is no ways of screening gravity.
In the development of relativistic gravitation and dynamical cosmology we may
10

notice three distinct stages: Ô¨Årst, investigation of models with matter sources in the
form of a perfect Ô¨Çuid, as was originally done by Einstein and Friedmann. Second,
studies of models with sources as diÔ¨Äerent physical Ô¨Åelds, starting from electromag-
netic and scalar ones, both in classical and quantum cases (see [4]). And third, which
is really topical now, application of ideas and results of uniÔ¨Åed models for treating
fundamental problems of cosmology, black hole and wormholes physics, especially in
high energy regimes and for explanation of the present acceleration of the Universe,
dark matter and dark energy problems. Multidimensional gravitational models play
an essential role in the latter approach.
The necessity of studying multidimensional models of gravitation and cosmology
[1, 2] is motivated by several reasons.
First, the main trend of modern physics
is the uniÔ¨Åcation of all known fundamental physical interactions: electromagnetic,
weak, strong and gravitational ones. During the recent decades there has been a
signiÔ¨Åcant progress in unifying weak and electromagnetic interactions, some more
modest achievements in GUT, supersymmetric, string and superstring theories.
Now, theories with membranes, p-branes and M-theory are being created and
studied. Having no deÔ¨Ånite successful theory of uniÔ¨Åcation now, it is desirable to
study the common features of these theories and their applications to solving basic
problems of modern gravity and cosmology. Second, multidimensional gravitational
models, as well as scalar-tensor theories of gravity, are theoretical frameworks for
describing possible temporal and range variations of fundamental physical constants
[4, 5, 6, 7]. The possible discovery of the Ô¨Åne structure constant variations and its
anisotropy is now at a critical further investigation.
Lastly, applying multidimensional gravitational models to basic problems of mod-
ern cosmology and black hole physics, we hope to Ô¨Ånd answers to such long-standing
problems as singular or nonsingular initial states, creation of the Universe, cre-
ation of matter and its entropy,cosmological constant, coincidence problem, origin
of inÔ¨Çation and speciÔ¨Åc scalar Ô¨Åelds which may be necessary for its realization,
isotropization and graceful exit problems, stability and nature of fundamental con-
stants [5, 12, 13], possible number of extra dimensions, their stable compactiÔ¨Åcation,
new data on present acceleration of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy etc.
Multidimensional gravitational models are certain generalizations of GR which
is tested reliably for weak Ô¨Åelds up to 0.0001 and partially in strong Ô¨Åelds (binary
pulsars), so it is quite natural to inquire about their possible observational or ex-
perimental windows. From what we already know, among these windows are:
‚Äì possible deviations from the Newton and Coulomb laws, or new interactions,
‚Äì possible variations of the eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant with a time rate
smaller than the Hubble one,
‚Äì possible existence of monopole modes in gravitational waves,
‚Äì diÔ¨Äerent behaviour of strong Ô¨Åeld objects, such as multidimensional black holes,
wormholes and AGN,
‚Äì standard cosmological tests,
‚Äì possible non-conservation of energy in strong Ô¨Åeld objects and accelerators, if
braneworld or similar ideas about gravity in the bulk turn out to be true, etc.
11

Since modern cosmology has already become a unique laboratory for testing
standard uniÔ¨Åed models of physical interactions at energies that are far beyond
the level of existing and future man-made accelerators, there exists a possibility of
using cosmological and astrophysical data for discriminating between future uniÔ¨Åed
schemes. Data on possible time variations or possible deviations from the Newton
law should also contribute to the uniÔ¨Åed theory choice.
As no accepted uniÔ¨Åed model exists, in our approach [1, 2, 14, 15] we adopted
models, based on multidimensional Einstein equations with or without sources of
diÔ¨Äerent nature as: cosmological constant, perfect and viscous Ô¨Çuids, scalar and
electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds and their possible interactions, dilaton and moduli Ô¨Åelds, Ô¨Åelds
of antisymmetric forms (related to p-branes) etc.
Our program‚Äôs main objective was and is to obtain exact self-consistent solu-
tions (integrable models) for these models and then to analyze them in cosmologi-
cal, spherically and axially symmetric cases. It is done mainly within Riemannian
geometry. In many cases we tried to single out models, which do not contradict
available experimental or observational data on variations of G.
As our model [1, 2] we use n Einstein spaces of constant curvature with sources
as (m+1)-component perfect Ô¨Çuid, (or Ô¨Åelds or form-Ô¨Åelds,), cosmological or spher-
ically symmetric metric, manifold as a direct product of factor-spaces of arbitrary
dimensions. Then in harmonic time gauge we show that Einstein multidimensional
equations are equivalent to Lagrange equations with non-diagonal in general min-
isuperspace metric and some exponential potential. After diagonalization of this
metric we perform reduction to sigma-model and Toda-like systems, further to Li-
ouville, Abel, generalized Emden-Fowler Eqs. etc. and try to Ô¨Ånd exact solutions.
We suppose that behavior of extra spaces is the following: they are constant, or
dynamically compactiÔ¨Åed, or like torus, or large, but with barriers, walls etc.
So, we realized the program in arbitrary dimensions (from 1988) [1, 2, 3, 14, 15]
in cosmology obtaining exact general solutions of multidimensional Einstein
equations with sources:
- Œõ , Œõ + scalar Ô¨Åeld (singled out nonsingular, dynamically compactiÔ¨Åed, inÔ¨Ça-
tionary, 1994);
- perfect Ô¨Çuid, PF + scalar Ô¨Åeld (e.g. nonsingular, inÔ¨Çationary solutions);
- viscous Ô¨Çuid (e.g. nonsingular, generation of mass and entropy, quintessence
and coincidence in 2-component model);
- stochastic behavior near the singularity, billiards in Lobachevsky space, D=11
is critical, œï destroys billiards (1994);
- for all above cases Ricci-Ô¨Çat solutions above were obtained for any n, also with
curvature in one factor-space; with curvatures in 2 factor-spaces only for total N=10,
11;
- Ô¨Åelds: scalar, dilatons, forms of arbitrary rank (1998) - inÔ¨Çationary, Œõ genera-
tion by forms (p-branes) [16];
- Ô¨Årst billiards for dilaton-forms (p-branes) interaction (1999);
- quantum variants (solutions of WDW-equation [17]) for all above cases where
classical solutions were obtained;
12

- dilatonic Ô¨Åelds with potentials [18, 19], billiard behavior for them also.
For many of these integrable models we calculated also the variation with time
of the eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant and comparison with present experimental
bounds allowed to choose particular models or single out some classes of solutions.
Solutions depending on r in any dimensions:
- generalized Schwarzchild, generalized Tangerlini (BH‚Äôs are singled out), also
with minimal scalar Ô¨Åeld (no BH‚Äôs);
- generalized Reissner-Nordstrom (BH‚Äôs also are singled out), the same plus œï
(no BH‚Äôs);
- multi-temporal;
- for dilaton-like interaction of œï and e.-m. Ô¨Åelds (BH‚Äôs exist only for a special
case);
- stability studies (stable solutions only for BH case above);
- the same for dilaton-forms (p-branes) interaction, stability found only in some
cases, e.g. for one form in particular.
PPN parameters for most of the models were calculated.
2. Multidimensional Models
The history of the multidimensional approach begins with the well-known papers
of T.K. Kaluza and O. Klein on 5-dimensional theories which opened an interest to
investigations in multidimensional gravity. A revival of ideas of many dimensions
started in the 70‚Äôs and continues now. Now, it is heated by expectations connected
with the overall M-theory. In all these theories, 4-dimensional gravitational models
with extra Ô¨Åelds were obtained from some multidimensional model by dimensional
reduction based on the decomposition of the manifold
M = M4 √ó Mint,
(1)
where M4 is our 4-dimensional manifold and Mint is some internal manifold (mostly
considered to be compact).
The earlier papers on multidimensional gravity and cosmology dealt with multi-
dimensional Einstein equations and with a block-diagonal cosmological or spherically
symmetric metric deÔ¨Åned on the manifold M = R √ó M0 √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó Mn of the form
g = ‚àídt ‚äódt +
n
X
r=0
a2
r(t)gr
(2)
where (Mr, gr) are Einstein spaces, r = 0, . . . , n. In some of them a cosmological
constant and simple scalar Ô¨Åelds were also used [17].
Such models are usually reduced to pseudo-Euclidean Toda-like systems with the
Lagrangian

and the zero-energy constraint E = 0.
It should be noted that pseudo-Euclidean Toda-like systems are not well-studied
yet. There exists a special class of equations of state that gives rise to Euclidean
Toda models [20].
Cosmological solutions are closely related to solutions with spherical symmetry
[21]. Moreover, the scheme of obtaining the latter is very similar to the cosmological
approach [1, 22]. In [23] the Schwarzschild solution was generalized to the case of
n internal Ricci-Ô¨Çat spaces and it was shown that a black hole conÔ¨Åguration takes
place when the scale factors of internal spaces are constants. It was shown there
also that a minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld is incompatible with the existence of black
holes. In [24] an analogous generalization of the Tangherlini solution was obtained,
and an investigation of singularities was performed in [25]. These solutions were
also generalized to the electrovacuum case with and without a scalar Ô¨Åeld [26, 27,
28]. Here, it was also proved that BH‚Äôs exist only when a scalar Ô¨Åeld is switched
oÔ¨Ä. Deviations from the Newton and Coulomb laws were obtained depending on
mass, charge and number of dimensions. In [28] spherically symmetric solutions
were obtained for a system of scalar and electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds with a dilaton-type
interaction and also deviations from the Coulomb law were calculated depending
on charge, mass, number of dimensions and dilaton coupling.
Multidimensional
dilatonic black holes were singled out. A theorem was proved in [28] that ‚Äúcuts‚Äù all
non-black-hole conÔ¨Ågurations as being unstable under even monopole perturbations.
In [29] the extremely charged dilatonic black hole solution was generalized to a multi-
center (Majumdar-Papapetrou) case when the cosmological constant is non-zero.
We note that for D = 4 the pioneering Majumdar-Papapetrou solutions with a
conformal scalar Ô¨Åeld and an electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld were considered in [30].
At present there exists a special interest to the so-called M- and F-theories
etc. These theories are ‚Äúsuper-membrane‚Äù analogues of the superstring models in
D = 11, 12 etc. The low-energy limit of these theories leads to multidimensional
models with p-branes.
Exact solutions with ‚Äùbranes‚Äù
In our papers several classes of the exact solutions for the multidimensional
gravitational model governed by the Lagrangian
L = R[g] ‚àí2Œõ ‚àíhŒ±Œ≤gMN‚àÇMœïŒ±‚àÇNœïŒ≤ ‚àí

na! exp(2ŒªaŒ±œïŒ±)(F a)2,
(4)
were considered. Here g is metric, F a = dAa are forms of ranks na and œïŒ± are scalar
Ô¨Åelds and Œõ is a cosmological constant (the matrix hŒ±Œ≤ is invertible).
It was proposed earlier that IIB string may have its origin in a 12-dimensional
theory, known as F-theory (Vafa). A low energy eÔ¨Äective (bosonic) Lagrangian for
F-theory was also suggested. The Ô¨Åeld content of this 12-dimensional Ô¨Åeld model is
the following one: metric, one scalar Ô¨Åeld (with negative kinetic term), 4-form and
5-form. In our work [31] a chain of so-called BD-models in dimensions D = 11, 12, . . .
was suggested. BD-model contains l = D ‚àí11 scalar Ô¨Åelds with negative kinetic
terms (i.e. scalar Ô¨Åelds are so-called ‚Äùphantom‚Äù Ô¨Åelds) coupled to (l + 1) diÔ¨Äerent
14

forms of ranks 4, . . . , 4+l. These models were constructed using p-brane intersection
rules that will be discussed below. For D = 11 (l = 0) BD-model coincides with
the truncated bosonic sector of D = 11 supergravity.
For D = 12 (l = 1) it
coincides with truncated D = 12 model.
It was conjectured by us in [31] that
these BD-models for D > 12 may correspond to low energy limits of some unknown
FD-theories (analogues of M‚àíand F-theories).
Description of the models.
In [15] certain classes of p-brane solutions to Ô¨Åeld equations corresponding to the
Lagrangian (4), obtained by us earlier, were presented.
These solutions have a block-diagonal metrics deÔ¨Åned on D-dimensional product
manifold, i.e.
g = e2Œ≥g0 +
n
X
i=1
e2œÜigi,
M0 √ó M1 √ó . . . √ó Mn,
(5)
where g0 is a metric on M0 (our space) and gi are Ô¨Åxed Ricci-Ô¨Çat (or Einstein)
metrics on Mi (internal space, i > 0). The moduli Œ≥, œÜi and scalar Ô¨Åelds œïŒ± are
functions on M0 and Ô¨Åelds of forms are also governed by several scalar functions
on M0.
Any F a is supposed to be a sum of monoms, corresponding to electric
or magnetic p-branes (p-dimensional analogues of membranes), i.e.
the so-called
composite p-brane ansatz is considered [32, 33].
(In non-composite case we have no more than one monom for each F a.) p = 0
corresponds to a particle, p = 1 to a string, p = 2 to a membrane etc. The p-brane
world-volume (world-line for p = 0, world-surface for p = 1 etc.) is isomorphic to
some product of internal manifolds: MI = Mi1 √ó . . . √ó Mik where 1 ‚â§i1 < . . . <
ik ‚â§n and has dimension p + 1 = di1 + . . . + dik = d(I), where I = {i1, . . . , ik}
is a multi-index describing the location of p-brane and di = dimMi. Any p-brane
is described by the triplet (p-brane index) s = (a, v, I), where a is the color index
labelling the form F a, v = e(lectric), m(agnetic). For the electric and magnetic
branes corresponding to form F a the world-volume dimensions are d(I) = na ‚àí1
and d(I) = D‚àína‚àí1, respectively. The sum of this dimensions is D‚àí2. For D = 11
supergravity we get d(I) = 3 and d(I) = 6, corresponding to electric M2-brane and
magnetic M5-brane.
Sigma model representation.
In [34] the model under consideration was reduced to gravitating self-interacting
sigma-model with certain constraints imposed. The sigma-model representation for
non-composite electric case was obtained earlier in [32, 33], for electric composite
case see also [35]).
The œÉ-model Lagrangian, obtained from (2.4), has the form [34]
LœÉ = R[g0] ‚àíÀÜGABg0¬µŒΩ‚àÇ¬µœÉA‚àÇŒΩœÉB ‚àí

where (œÉA) = (œÜi, œïŒ±), V is a potential, ( ÀÜGAB) are components of (truncated) target
15

space metric, Œµs = ¬±1,
Us = Us
AœÉA =

i‚ààIs
diœÜi ‚àíœásŒªasŒ±œïŒ±
are linear functions, Œ¶s are scalar functions on M0 (corresponding to forms), and
s = (as, vs, Is). Here parameter œás = +1 for the electric brane (vs = e) and œás = ‚àí1
for the magnetic one (vs = m).
A pure gravitational sector of the sigma-model was considered earlier in our
paper [21].
For p-brane applications g0 is Euclidean, ( ÀÜGAB) is positive deÔ¨Ånite
(for d0 > 2) and Œµs = ‚àí1, if pseudo-Euclidean (electric and magnetic) p-branes in
a pseudo-Euclidean space-time are considered. The sigma-model (6) may be also
considered for the pseudo-Euclidean metric g0 of signature (‚àí, +, . . . , +) (e.g. in
investigations of gravitational waves).
In this case for a positive deÔ¨Ånite matrix
( ÀÜGAB) and Œµs = 1 we get a non-negative kinetic energy terms.
The co-vectors Us play a key role in studying the integrability of the Ô¨Åeld equa-
tions [34, 37] and possible existence of stochastic behavior near the singularity, see
our paper [36]. An important mathematical characteristic here is the matrix of scalar
products (Us, Us‚Ä≤) = ÀÜGABUs
AUs‚Ä≤
B , where ( ÀÜGAB) = ( ÀÜGAB)‚àí1. The scalar products for
co-vectors Us were calculated in [34] (for electric case see [32, 33, 35] )
(Us, Us‚Ä≤) = d(Is ‚à©Is‚Ä≤) + d(Is)d(Is‚Ä≤)
2 ‚àíD
+ œásœás‚Ä≤ŒªasŒ±Œªas‚Ä≤Œ≤hŒ±Œ≤,
where (hŒ±Œ≤) = (hŒ±Œ≤)‚àí1; s = (as, vs, Is), s‚Ä≤ = (as‚Ä≤, vs‚Ä≤, Is‚Ä≤). They depend upon
brane intersections (Ô¨Årst term), dimensions of brane world-volumes and total di-
mension D (second term), scalar products of dilatonic coupling vectors and electro-
magnetic types of branes (third term). As will be shown below the so-called ‚Äúin-
tersections rules‚Äù(i.e.
relations for d(Is ‚à©Is‚Ä≤)) are deÔ¨Åned by scalar products of
Us-vectors.
Cosmological and spherically symmetric solutions.
A family of general cosmological type p-brane solutions with n Ricci-Ô¨Çat internal
spaces was considered, where also a generalization to the case of n ‚àí1 Ricci-Ô¨Çat
spaces and one Einstein space of non-zero curvature (say M1) was obtained. These
solutions are deÔ¨Åned up to solutions to Toda-type equations and may be obtained
using the Lagrange dynamics following from our sigma-model approach [31]. The
solutions contain a subclass of spherically symmetric solutions (for M1 = Sd1). Spe-
cial solutions with orthogonal and block-orthogonal sets of U-vectors were considered
earlier in our works [31] and [14], respectively. (For non-composite case, see [39, 40])
and references therein.)
Toda solutions.
In [31] the reduction of p-brane cosmological type solutions to Toda-like sys-
tems was Ô¨Årst performed. General classes of p-brane solutions (cosmological and
spherically symmetric ones) related to Euclidean Toda lattices associated with Lie
algebras (mainly Am, Cm ones) were obtained in [41, 43, 44, 46, 47].
16

A class of space-like brane (S-brane) solutions (related to Toda-type systems)
with product of Ricci-Ô¨Çat internal spaces and S-brane solutions with special orthog-
onal intersection rules were considered in [55, 56] and solutions with accelerated
expansion (e.g. with power-law and exponential behavior of scale factors) were sin-
gled out.
Black brane solutions.
In [46, 47] a family of spherically-symmetric solutions was investigated and a
subclass of black-hole conÔ¨Ågurations related to Toda-type equations with certain
asymptotical conditions imposed was singled out. These black hole solutions are
governed by functions Hs(z) > 0, deÔ¨Åned on the interval (0, (2¬µ)‚àí1), where ¬µ > 0
is the extremality parameter, and obey a set of diÔ¨Äerential equations (equivalent to
Toda-type ones)

Hs(+0) = 1, s ‚ààS.
Here ¬ØBs Ã∏= 0 and (Ass‚Ä≤) is a quasi-Cartan
matrix.
In refs. [45, 46, 47] the following hypothesis was suggested: the functions Hs are

correspond to semi-simple Lie algebras, i.e. when (Ass‚Ä≤) is a Cartan matrix.

This hypothesis was veriÔ¨Åed for Lie algebras: Am, Cm+1, m = 1, 2, . . ., in
[46, 47]. It was also conÔ¨Årmed by special black-hole ‚Äùblock orthogonal‚Äù solutions
considered earlier in [14, 42].
In [45, 46, 47] explicit formulas for the solution corresponding to the algebra A2
are presented. These formulas are illustrated by two examples of A2-dyon solutions:
a dyon in D = 11 supergravity (with M2 and M5 branes intersecting at a point) and
Kaluza-Klein dyon. Extremal conÔ¨Ågurations (e.g. with multi-black-hole extension)
were also obtained.
We note, that special black hole solutions with orthogonal U-vectors were con-
sidered in [38] (for non-composite case) and [31]. These solutions have analogous in
models with multicomponent perfect Ô¨Çuid [49, 51, 52].
The black brane solution, corresponding to Lie algebras C2 and A3 where ob-
tained in [50].
17

In [38] some propositions related to i) interconnection between the Hawking
temperature and the singularity behavior, and ii) multitemporal conÔ¨Ågurations were
proved.
It should be noted that polynomial structure was found also for the so-called Ô¨Çux
brane solutions, that occur as generalizations of the well-known Melvin solution.
Cosmological models in diverse dimensions
Scalar Ô¨Åelds play an essential role in modern cosmology. They are attributed to
inÔ¨Çation models of the hypothetical early universe and the models describing the
present stage of the accelerated expansion as well. There is no unique candidate for
the potential of the minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld. Typically a potential is a sum
of exponents. Such potentials appear quite generically in a large class of theories:
multidimensional, Kaluza-Klein models, supergravity and string/M - theories.
Single exponential potential was extensively studied within Friedmann-Robertson-
Walker (FRW) 4D-model containing both a minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld and a
perfect Ô¨Çuid with the linear barotropic equation of state . The attention was mainly
focussed on the qualitative behavior of solutions, stability of the exceptional solu-
tions to curvature and shear perturbations and their possible applications within the
known cosmological scenario such as inÔ¨Çation and scaling (‚Äùtracking‚Äù) . In particu-
lar, it was found by a phase plane analysis that for ‚ÄùÔ¨Çat‚Äù positive potentials there
exists an unique late-time attractor in the form of the scalar dominated solution. It
is stable within homogeneous and isotropic models with non-zero spatial curvature
with respect to spatial curvature perturbations and provides the power-law inÔ¨Çation.
For ‚Äùintermediate‚Äù positive potentials an unique late-time attractor is the scaling
solution, where the scalar Ô¨Åeld ‚Äùmimics‚Äù the perfect Ô¨Çuid, adopting its equation of
state. The energy-density of the scalar Ô¨Åeld scales with that of the perfect Ô¨Çuid.
Using our methods for multidimensional cosmology the problem of integrability by
quadratures of the model in 4-dimensions was also studied. Four classes of general
solutions, when the parameter characterizing the steepness of the potential and the
barotropic parameter obey some relations, were found [60]. For the case of multi-
ple exponential potential of the scalar Ô¨Åeld and dust integrable model in 4D was
obtained in [61].
As to scalar Ô¨Åelds with the multiple exponential potential in any dimensions,
a wide class of exact solutions was obtained in [18, 19]. In [54] a behavior of this
system near the singularity was studied using a billiard approach suggested earlier
in [53, 36]. A number of S-brane solutions may be found in [55, 56].
Details for 2-component D-dimensional integrable models see in [63, 58, 59].
Quite diÔ¨Äerent model with dilaton, branes and cosmological constant and static
internal spaces was investigated in [16], where possible generation of the eÔ¨Äective
cosmological constant by branes was demonstrated. Model with variable equations
of state see in [62] with acceleration of our space and compactiÔ¨Åcation of internal
spaces.
Cosmological models with time variations of G.
As we mentioned before cosmological models in scalar-tensor and multidimen-
sional theories are the framework for describing possible variations of fundamental
18

physical constants with time due to scalar Ô¨Åelds present explicitly in STT or gener-
ated by extra dimensions in multidimensional approach. In [66] we obtained solu-
tions for the system of conformal scalar and gravitational Ô¨Åelds in 4D and calculated
the present possible relative variation of G at the level of less than 5 x 10‚àí13year‚àí1.
Later, in the frames of a multidimensional model with a perfect Ô¨Çuid and 2 factor
spaces (our 3D space of Friedmann open, closed and Ô¨Çat models) and internal 6D
Ricci-Ô¨Çat one, we obtained the same limit for such variation of G [9].
We estimated also the possible variations of the gravitational constant G in the
framework of a generalized (Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt) scalar-tensor theory of
gravity on the basis of the Ô¨Åeld equations, without using their special solutions.
SpeciÔ¨Åc estimates were essentially related to the values of other cosmological pa-
rameters (the Hubble and acceleration parameters, the dark matter density etc.),
but the values of G-dot/G compatible with modern observations do not exceeded 5
x 10‚àí13 per year [74].
In [73] we continued the studies of models in arbitrary dimensions and obtained
the relations for G-dot in multidimensional model with Ricci-Ô¨Çat internal space and
multicomponent perfect Ô¨Çuid.
A two-component example: dust + 5-brane, was
considered. It was shown that G-dot/G is less than 5 10‚àí13year‚àí1. Expressions for
G-dot were considered also in a multidimensional model with an Einstein internal
space and a multicomponent perfect Ô¨Çuid [76]. In the case of two factor-spaces with
non-zero curvatures without matter, a mechanism for prediction of small G-dot was
suggested.
The result was compared with exact (1+3+6)-dimensional solutions,
obtained by us earlier [75, 76].
Multidimensional cosmological model describing the dynamics of n+1 Ricci-Ô¨Çat
factor-spaces Mi in the presence of a one-component anisotropic Ô¨Çuid was considered
in [82]. The pressures in all spaces were supposed to be proportional to the density:
pi = wiœÅ, i = 0,...,n. Solutions with accelerated power-law expansion of our 3-space
M0 and small enough variation of the gravitational constant G were found. These
solutions exist for two branches of the parameter w0. The Ô¨Årst branch describes the
super-stiÔ¨Ämatter with w0 > 1, the second one may contain a phantom matter with
w0 < ‚àí1, e.g., when G grows with time, so this branch may describe not present,
but earlier stages only.
Similar exact solutions, but nonsingular and with an exponential behaviour of
the scale factors were considered in [83] for the same multidimensional cosmological
model describing the dynamics of n + 1 Ricci-Ô¨Çat factor spaces Mi in the presence
of a one-component perfect Ô¨Çuid. Solutions with accelerated exponential expansion
of our 3-space M0 and small variation of the gravitational constant G were found
also.
Exact S-brane solutions with 2 electric branes and 2 phantom scalar Ô¨Åelds in the
manifold
M = (0, +‚àû) √ó R √ó M2 √ó M3 √ó M4 √ó M5.
(8)
were obtained and studied in [84]. We got the asymptotic accelerated expansion
19

of our 3-dimensional factor space and variations obeying the present experimental
constraints of G-dot/G equal or less than 5 10‚àí13year‚àí1.
Spherically-symmetric solutions, black holes and PPN parameters.
In [34] it was shown that, after dimensional reduction on the manifold M0√óM1√ó
¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑√óMn and when the composite p-brane ansatz is considered, the problem is reduced
to the gravitating self-interacting œÉ-model with certain constraints. For electric p-
branes see also [33, 35] (in [35] the composite electric case was considered). This
representation may be considered as a powerful tool for obtaining diÔ¨Äerent solutions
with intersecting p-branes. In [34, 37] Majumdar-Papapetrou type solutions were
obtained (for the non-composite electric case see [33] and for the composite electric
case see [35]). These solutions correspond to Ricci-Ô¨Çat (Mi, gi), i = 1, . . . , n and were
generalized to the case of Einstein internal spaces [34]. The obtained solutions take
place when certain orthogonality relations (on couplings parameters, dimensions of
‚Äúbranes‚Äù, total dimension) are imposed. In this situation a class of cosmological and
spherically symmetric solutions was obtained [31]. Solutions with a horizon (black
branes) were considered in detail in [38, 31].
It should be noted that multidimensional and multitemporal generalizations of
the Schwarzschild and Tangherlini solutions were considered in [27, 64], where the
generalized Newton formulas in a multitemporal case were obtained.
We also calculated the Post-Newtonian Parameters Œ≤ and Œ≥ (Eddington param-
eters) for general spherically symmetric solutions and black holes in particular [14].
These parameters depending on p-brane charges, their worldvolume dimensions,
dilaton couplings and number of dimensions may be useful for possible physical
applications.
Some speciÔ¨Åc models in classical and quantum multidimensional cases with p-
branes were analysed. Exact solutions for the system of scalar Ô¨Åelds and Ô¨Åelds of
forms with a dilatinic type interactions for generalized intersection rules were studied
in [46], where the PPN parameters were also calculated. Other problems connected
with observations and general properties of BH‚Äôs were studied in a braneworld in
[57].
Also, a stability analysis for solutions with p-branes was carried out [48, 71].
It was shown there that for some simple p-brane systems multidimensional black
branes are stable under monopole perturbations while other (non-BH) sperically
symmetric solutions turned out to be unstable.
Below we dwell mainly upon some problems of fundamental physical constants,
the gravitational constant in particular, upon the SEE and laboratory projects to
measure G and its possible variations shortly and on some theoretical models with
variations of the eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant.
3. Fundamental physical constants
In any physical theory we meet with constants which characterize the stability
properties of diÔ¨Äerent types of matter: of objects, processes, classes of processes and
20

so on. These constants are important because they arise independently in diÔ¨Äerent
situations and have the same value, at any rate within accuracies we have gained
nowadays. That is why they are called fundamental physical constants (FPC) [4, 12].
It is impossible to deÔ¨Åne strictly this notion. It is because the constants, mainly
dimensional, are present in deÔ¨Ånite physical theories. In the process of scientiÔ¨Åc
progress some theories are replaced by more general ones with their own constants,
some relations between old and new constants arise. So, we may talk not about an
absolute choice of FPC, but only about a choice corresponding to the present state
of physical sciences.
Really, before the creation of the electroweak interaction theory and some Grand
UniÔ¨Åcation Models, this choice was considered as follows:
c, ‚Ñè, Œ±, GF , gs, mp (or me), G, H, œÅ, Œõ, k, I,
(9)
where Œ±, GF , gs and G are constants of electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravita-
tional interactions, H, œÅ and Œõ are cosmological parameters (the Hubble constant,
mean density of the Universe and cosmological constant), k and I are the Boltzmann
constant and the mechanical equivalent of heat which play the role of conversion
factors between temperature on the one hand, energy and mechanical units on the
other. After adoption in 1983 of a new deÔ¨Ånition of the meter (Œª = ct or ‚Ñì= ct) this
role is partially played also by the speed of light c. It is now also a conversion factor
between units of time (frequency) and length, it is deÔ¨Åned with the absolute (null)
accuracy. With the new suggested deÔ¨Ånitions of basic units of the International
System of Units (SI) such a role may play also ‚Ñèand NA, where NA is the Avogadro
number.
Now, when the theory of electroweak interactions has a Ô¨Årm experimental basis
and we have some good models of strong interactions, a more prefarable choice is as
follows:
‚Ñè, (c), e, me, Œ∏w, GF , Œ∏c, ŒõQCD, G, H, œÅ, Œõ, k, I
(10)
and, possibly, three angles of Kobayashi-Maskawa ‚Äî Œ∏2, Œ∏3 and Œ¥.
Here Œ∏w is
the Weinberg angle, Œ∏c is the Cabibbo angle and ŒõQCD is a cut-oÔ¨Äparameter of
quantum chromodynamics. Of course, if a theory of four known now interactions
will be created (M-, F-or other), then we will probably have another choice. As
we see, the macro constants remain the same, though in some uniÔ¨Åed models, i.e.
in multidimensional ones, they may be related in some manner (see below). From
the point of view of these uniÔ¨Åed models the above mentioned ones are low energy
constants.
All these constants are known with diÔ¨Äerent accuracies.
The most precisely
deÔ¨Åned constant was and remain the speed of light c: its accuracy was 10‚àí10 and
now it is deÔ¨Åned with the null accuracy. Atomic constants, e, ‚Ñè, m and others are
determined with errors 10‚àí6 √∑ 10‚àí8, G up to 10‚àí4 or even worse, Œ∏w ‚Äî up to 10‚àí3;
the accuracy of H is about several percents. Other cosmological parameters (FPC):
mean density estimations vary also within 2 percent; for Œõ we have now data that
its corresponding energy density exceeds the matter density (0.7 and 0.3 of the total
universe mass correspondingly).
21

As to the nature of the FPC, we may mention several approaches. One of the
Ô¨Årst hypotheses belongs to J.A. Wheeler: in each cycle of the Universe evolution
the FPC arise anew along with physical laws which govern this evolution. Thus, the
nature of the FPC and physical laws are connected with the origin and evolution of
our Universe.
A less global approach to the nature of dimensional constants suggests that
they are needed to make physical relations dimensionless or they are measures of
asymptotic states. Really, the speed of light appears in relativistic theories in factors
like v/c, at the same time velocities of usual bodies are smaller than c, so it plays
also the role of an asymptotic limit. The same sense have some other FPC: ‚Ñèis the
minimal quantum of action, e is the minimal observable charge (if we do not take
into account quarks which are not observable in a free state) etc.
Finally, FPC or their combinations may be considered as natural scales determin-
ing the basic units. While the earlier basic units were chosen more or less arbitrarily,
i.e., the second, meter and kilogram, now the Ô¨Årst two are based on stable (quantum)
phenomena. Their stability is believed to be ensured by the physical laws which in-
clude FPC. There appeared similar suggestions for a new reproducible realization
of a kg, Ô¨Åxing values of NA or other constants, e.g. ‚Ñè[91].
An exact knowledge of FPC and precision measurements are necessary for testing
main physical theories, extension of our knowledge of nature and, in the long run,
for practical applications of fundamental theories.
Within this, such theoretical
problems arise:
1) development of models for confrontation of theory with experiment in critical
situations (i.e. for veriÔ¨Åcation of GR, QED, QCD, GUT or other uniÔ¨Åed models);
2) setting limits for spacial and temporal variations of FPC. It is becoming
especially important now with the idea to introduce new basic units of International
System of Units (SI), based completely on FPC.
As to a classiÔ¨Åcation of FPC, we may set them now into four groups according
to their generality:
1) Universal constants such as ‚Ñè, which divides all phenomena into quantum
and non-quantum ones (micro- and macro-worlds) and to a certain extent c, which
divides all motions into relativistic and non-relativistic ones;
2) constants of interactions like Œ±, Œ∏w, ŒõQCD and G;
3) constants of elementary constituencies of matter like me, mw, mx, etc., and
4) transformation multipliers such as k, I and partially c (conversion from the
second to the meter). Soon there may be more after modernization of SI - values of
‚Ñè, e, k and NA may be Ô¨Åxed with zero uncertainty.
Of course, this division into classes is not absolute. Many constants move from
one class to another. Some of the constants ceased to be fundamental (i.e. densities,
magnetic moments, etc.) as they are calculated via other FPC.
As to the number of FPC, there are two opposite tendencies: the number of
‚Äúold‚Äù FPC is usually diminishing when a new, more general theory is created, but
at the same time new Ô¨Åelds of science arise, new processes are discovered in which
new constants appear. So, in the long run we may come to some minimal choice
22

which is characterized by one or several FPC, maybe connected with the so-called
Planck parameters ‚Äî combinations of c, ‚Ñèand G (natural, or Planck system of units
[12, 13]):
L =
¬µ‚ÑèG
c3
¬∂1/2
‚àº10‚àí33 cm,
mL = (c‚Ñè/2G)1/2 ‚àº10‚àí5 g,
œÑL = L/c‚àº10‚àí43 s.
(11)
The role of these parameters is important since mL characterizes the energy of
uniÔ¨Åcation of four known fundamental interactions: strong, weak, electromagnetic
and gravitational ones, and L is a scale where the classical notions of space-time
loose their meaning. There are other ideas about the Ô¨Ånal number of FPC (2, 1, or
none). Of course, all will depend on a future uniÔ¨Åed theory.
The problem of the gravitational constant G measurement and its stability is a
part of a rapidly developing Ô¨Åeld, called gravitational-relativistic metrology (GRM).
It has appeared due to the growth of measurement technology precision, spread of
measurements over large scales and a tendency to the uniÔ¨Åcation of fundamental
physical interaction [7], where main problems arise and are concentrated on the
gravitational interaction.
The main subjects of GRM are:
- general relativistic models for diÔ¨Äerent astronomical scales: Earth, Solar Sys-
tem, galaxes, cluster of galaxies, cosmology;
- time transfer, VLBI, space dynamics, relativistic astrometry etc.(pioneering
works were done in Russia by Arifov and Kadyev, Brumberg in 60‚Äôs);
- development of generalized gravitational theories and uniÔ¨Åed models for testing
their eÔ¨Äects in experiments;
- fundamental physical constants, G in particular, and their stability in space
and time; projects ¬µSCOPE, STEP, SEE...
- fundamental cosmological parameters as FPC: cosmological models studies
(quintessence, k-essence, phantom, multidimensional ones), measurements and ob-
servations; WMAP, PLANCK, ...
- gravitational waves (3d generations of detectors, study of sources...); LIGO,
VIRGO, TAMA, LISA, RADIOASTRON,...
- basic standards (clocks) and other modern precision devices (atomic and neu-
tron interferometry, atomic force spectroscopy etc.) in fundamental gravitational
experiments, especially in space for testing GR and other theories : rotational, tor-
sional and second order eÔ¨Äects (need uncertainty 10‚àí6), e.g.
LAGEOS, Gravity
Probe B, ASTROD, LATOR etc.
We are now on the level 2.3 ¬∑ 10‚àí5 in measuring PPN-parameter Œ≥ and 5 ¬∑ 10‚àí4
- for Œ≤, Brans-Dicke parameter œâ > 40000. Proposed several future missions aimed
to increase the accuracy of Œ≥.
23

There are three problems related to G, which origin lies mainly in uniÔ¨Åed models
predictions: 1) absolute G measurements, 2) possible time variations of G, 3) possible
range variations of G ‚Äì non-Newtonian, or new interactions.
Absolute measurements of G. There are many laboratory determinations of G
with errors of the order 10‚àí3 and some are on the level of 10‚àí4 .
The most recent and precise G measurements do not agree with each other and
some diÔ¨Äer from the CODATA value of 2010:
G = 6.67384(80) ¬∑ 10‚àí11 ¬∑ m3 ¬∑ kg‚àí1 ¬∑ s‚àí2
(12)
with relative standard uncertainty 1.2 ¬∑ 10‚àí4.
So, we see that we are not too far (about two orders) from Cavendish, who
obtained value of G 2 centuries ago at the level 10‚àí2. The situation with the mea-
surement of the absolute value of G is really diÔ¨Äerent from atomic constants values
and their uncertainties (10‚àí8). This means that either the limit of terrestrial ac-
curacies of deÔ¨Åning G has been reached or we have some new physics entering the
measurement procedure [7]. The Ô¨Årst means that, maybe we should turn to space
experiments to measure G [12, 11], and the second means that a more thorough
study of theories, generalizing GR, or uniÔ¨Åed theories is necessary.
There exist also some satellite determinations of G (namely G ¬∑ MEarth) on the
level of 10‚àí9 (so, should we know G much better, our knowledge of masses of the
Earth and other planets will be much better and consequently their models).
The precise knowledge of G is necessary, Ô¨Årst of all, as it is a FPC; next, for the
evaluation of mass of the Earth, planets, their mean density and, Ô¨Ånally, for con-
struction of Earth models; for transition from mechanical to electromagnetic units
and back; for evaluation of other constants through relations between them given
by uniÔ¨Åed theories; for Ô¨Ånding new possible types of interactions and geophysical
eÔ¨Äects; for some practical applications like increasing of gradiometers precision, as
they demand a calibration by a gravitational Ô¨Åeld of a standard body depending on
G: high accuracy of their calibration (10‚àí5 - 10‚àí6) requires the same accuracy of G.
The knowledge of constants values has not only a fundamental meaning but also a
metrological one. The modern system of standards is based mainly on stable physical
phenomena. So, the stability of constants plays a crucial role. As all physical laws
were established and tested during the last 2-3 centuries in experiments on the Earth
and in the near space, i.e. at a rather short space and time intervals in comparison
with the radius and age of the Universe, the possibility of slow variations of constants
(i.e. with the rate of the evolution of the Universe or slower) cannot be excluded a
priori.
So, the assumption of absolute stability of constants is an extrapolation and each
time we must test it.
Time Variations of G. The problem of FPC variations arose with the attempts
to explain the relations between micro- and macro-world phenomena. Dirac was the
Ô¨Årst to introduce (1937) the so-called ‚ÄúLarge Numbers Hypothesis‚Äù which relates
some known very big (or very small) numbers with the dimensionless age of the
24

Universe T ‚àº1040 (age of the Universe is 1017 s, divided by the characteristic
elementary particle time 10‚àí23 s). He suggested that the ratio of the gravitational
to strong interaction strengths, Gm2
p/‚Ñèc ‚àº10‚àí40, is inversely proportional to the
age of the Universe: Gm2
p/‚Ñèc ‚àºT ‚àí1. Then, as the age varies, some constants or
their combinations must vary as well. Atomic constants seemed to Dirac to be more
stable, so he chose the variation of G as T ‚àí1.
After the original Dirac hypothesis some new ones appeared (Gamov, Teller,
Landau, Terazawa, Staniukovich etc., see [4, 12]) and also some generalized theories
of gravitation admitting the variations of an eÔ¨Äective gravitational coupling. We
may single out three stages in the development of this Ô¨Åeld:
1. Study of theories and hypotheses with variations of FPC, their predictions
and confrontation with experiments (1937-1977).
2. Creation of theories admitting variations of an eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant
in a particular system of units, analyses of experimental and observational data
within these theories [65, 4] (1977-present).
3. Analyses of FPC variations within uniÔ¨Åed models [7, 5, 1] (present).
Within the development of the Ô¨Årst stage from the analysis of the whole set of
existed astronomical, astrophysical, geophysical and laboratory data, a conclusion
was made [65, 66] that variations of atomic constants are excluded, but variation of
the eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant in the atomic system of units does not contradict
the available experimental data on the level 10‚àí12 √∑ 10‚àí13year‚àí1.
Moreover, in
[65, 66] the conception was worked out that variations of constants are not absolute
but depend on the system of measurements (choice of standards, units and devices
using this or that fundamental interaction). Each fundamental interaction through
dynamics, described by the corresponding theory, deÔ¨Ånes the system of units and the
corresponding system of basic standards, e.g. atomic and gravitational (ephemeris)
seconds.
There are diÔ¨Äerent astronomical, geophysical and laboratory data on possible
variations of FPC [12].
But the most strict present data on variations of strong, electromagnetic, gravi-
tational and week interaction constants are the following:
| ÀôGs/Gs| < 5 ¬∑ 10‚àí19 year‚àí1,
| ÀôŒ±/Œ±| < 10‚àí17 year‚àí1,
(13)
| ÀôG/G| < 5 ¬∑ 10‚àí13 year‚àí1,
| ÀôGF /GF | < 2 ¬∑ 10‚àí12 year‚àí1.
Some studies of strong interaction constant and its dependance on transferred
momenta may be found in [81]. The recent review on variations of Œ± see in [90].
There appeared some data on a possible variation of Œ± on the level of 10‚àí16
at some z [79]. Other groups do not support these results. Also appeared data
on possible violation of me/mp (Varshalovich et al.)
The problem may be that
even if they are correct, all these results are mean values of variations at some
epoch of the evolution of the Universe (certain z interval ). In essence variations
25

may be diÔ¨Äerent at diÔ¨Äerent epochs (if they exist at all) and at the next stage
observational data should be analyzed with the account of evolution of corresponding
(‚Äùtrue‚Äù)cosmological models.
Now we still have no uniÔ¨Åed theory of all four interactions. So it is possible to
construct systems of measurements based on any of these four interactions. But
practically it is done now on the basis of the mostly worked out theory ‚Äî on elec-
trodynamics (more precisely on QED). Of course, it may be done also on the basis
of the gravitational interaction (as it was partially earlier). Then, diÔ¨Äerent units of
basic physical quantities arise based on dynamics of the given interaction, i.e. the
atomic (electromagnetic) second, deÔ¨Åned via frequency of atomic transitions or the
gravitational second deÔ¨Åned by the mean Earth motion around the Sun (ephemeris
time).
It does not follow from anything that these two seconds are always synchronized
in time and space.
So, in principal they may evolve relative to each other, for
example at the rate of the evolution of the Universe or at some slower rate.
That is why, in general, variations of the gravitational constant are possible
in the atomic system of units (c, ‚Ñè, m are constant, Jordan frame) and masses
of all particles ‚Äî in the gravitational system of units (G, ‚Ñè, c are constant by
deÔ¨Ånition, Einstein frame). Practically we can test only the Ô¨Årst variant since the
modern basic standards are deÔ¨Åned in the atomic system of measurements. Possible
variations of FPC must be tested experimentally but for this it is necessary to have
the corresponding theories admitting such variations and their certain eÔ¨Äects.
Mathematically these systems of measurement may be realized as conformally
related metric forms. Arbitrary conformal transformations give us a transition to
an arbitrary system of measurements.
We know that scalar-tensor and multidimensional theories are corresponding
frameworks for these variations. So, one of the ways to describe variable gravita-
tional coupling is the introduction of a scalar Ô¨Åeld as an additional variable of the
gravitational interaction. It may be done by diÔ¨Äerent means (e.g. Jordan, Brans-
Dicke, Canuto and others). We have suggested a variant of gravitational theory with
a conformal scalar Ô¨Åeld (Higgs-type Ô¨Åeld [67, 4]) where Einstein‚Äôs general relativ-
ity may be considered as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking of conformal
symmetry (Domokos, 1976) [4]. In our variant spontaneous symmetry breaking of
the global gauge invariance leads to a nonsingular cosmology [68]. Besides, we may
get variations of the eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant in the atomic system of units
when m, c, ‚Ñèare constant and variations of all masses in the gravitational system
of units (G, c, ‚Ñèare constant). It is done on the basis of approximate [69] and exact
cosmological solutions with local inhomogeneity [70].
As to other experimental or observational data, the results are of diÔ¨Äerent quality.
The most reliable ones are based on lunar laser ranging (Nordtvedt, 2003; Turyshev,
2008) and Pitjeva‚Äôs result (2006, 2010) on radar ranging and optical observations.
They are less than 5 10‚àí1 per year. Here, once more we see that there is a need for
corresponding theoretical and experimental studies. Probably, future space missions
like Earth SEE-satellite [10, 11, 12, 13] or missions to other planets and lunar laser
26

ranging will be a decisive step in solving the problem of temporal variations of G and
determining the fates of diÔ¨Äerent theories which predict them, since the greater is
the time interval between successive measurements and, of course, the more precise
they are, the more stringent results will be obtained.
As was shown in [5, 72, 1] temporal variations of FPC are connected with each
other in multidimensional models of uniÔ¨Åcation of interactions. So, experimental
tests on ÀôŒ±/Œ± may at the same time be used for estimation of ÀôG/G and vice versa.
Moreover, variations of G are related also to the cosmological parameters œÅ, ‚Ñ¶and
q which gives opportunities of raising the precision of their determination.
As variations of FPC are closely connected with the behavior of internal scale
factors [8], it is a direct probe of properties of extra dimensions and the corresponding
uniÔ¨Åed theories [8, 9, 1]. From this point of view it is an additional test of not only
gravity and cosmology, but uniÔ¨Åed theories of physical interactions as well.
Non-Newtonian interactions, or range variations of G. Nearly all modiÔ¨Åed theories
of gravity and uniÔ¨Åed theories predict also some deviations from the Newton law
(inverse square law, ISL) or composition-dependent violations of the Equivalence
Principle (EP) due to appearance of new possible massive particles (partners) [5].
Experimental data exclude the existence of these particles on a very good level at
nearly all ranges except less than micrometer and also at meters and hundreds of
meters ranges. Our recent analysis of experimental bounds and new limits on possi-
ble ISL violation using the new method and modern precession data from satellites,
planets, binary pulsar and LLR data were obtained in [77].
In the Einstein theory G is a true constant. But, if we think that G may vary
with time, then, from a relativistic point of view, it may vary with distance as well.
In GR massless gravitons are mediators of the gravitational interaction, they obey
second-order diÔ¨Äerential equations and interact with matter with a constant strength
G. If any of these requirements is violated, we come in general to deviations from
the Newton law with range (or to generalization of GR).
In [6] we analyzed several classes of such theories:
1. Theories with massive gravitons like bimetric ones or theories with a Œõ-term.
2. Theories with an eÔ¨Äective gravitational constant like the general scalar-tensor
ones.
3. Theories with torsion.
4. Theories with higher derivatives (4th-order equations etc.), where massive
modes appear leading to short-range additional forces.
5. More elaborated theories with other mediators besides gravitons (partners),
like supergravity, superstrings, M-theory etc.
6.
Theories with nonlinearities induced by any known physical interactions
(Born-Infeld etc.)
7. Phenomenological models where the detailed mechanism of deviation is not
known (Ô¨Åfth or other force).
8. ModiÔ¨Åcations of the Newton law at large ranges (MOND etc.), small acceler-
ation at a > a0 (Pioneer anomaly, etc.)
27

In all these theories some eÔ¨Äective or real masses appear leading to Yukawa-type
(or power-law) deviations from the Newton law, characterized by strength Œ± and
range Œª.
There exist some model-dependant estimations of these forces.
Some p-brane models (ADD, branewolds) also predict non-Newtonian additional
interactions of both Yukawa or power-law, in particular in the less than 10nm range,
what is intensively discussed nowadays [13, 78]. About PPN parameters for multi-
dimensional models with p-branes see above, section 2.
More serious evidence on a possible violation of Newton‚Äôs Law has come to us
from space, namely, from data processing on the motion of the spacecrafts Pioneer
10 and 11, referring to length ranges of the order of or exceeding the size of the Solar
system. The discovered anomalous (additional) acceleration is (8.60 ¬± 1.34) ¬∑10‚àí8
cm/s2. It acts on the spacecrafts and is directed towards the Sun. This acceleration
is not explained yet completely by known eÔ¨Äects, bodies or inÔ¨Çuences related to the
design of the spacecrafts themselves (leakage etc.), as was conÔ¨Årmed by independent
calculations.
Many diÔ¨Äerent approaches have been analyzed both in the framework of standard
theories and invoking new physics, but none of them now seems to be suÔ¨Éciently
convincing and generally accepted.
This Pioneer anomaly has caused new proposals of space missions with more
precise experiments and a wide spectrum of research at the Solar system length
range and beyond:
‚Äî Cosmic Vision 2015-2025, suggested by the European Space Agency, and
‚Äî Pioneer Anomaly Explorer, suggested by NASA. So, we hope they contribute a
lot to our knowledge of gravity and uniÔ¨Åed models.
SEE - Project. We saw that there are three problems connected with G. There is
a promising new multi-purpose space experiment SEE - Satellite Energy Exchange
[10, 11], which addresses all these problems and may be more eÔ¨Äective in solving
them than other laboratory or space experiments.
This experiment is based on a limited 3-body problem of celestial mechanics:
small and large masses in a drag-free satellite and the Earth. Unique horse-shoe
orbits, which are eÔ¨Äectively one-dimensional, are used in it.
The aims of the SEE-project are to measure: Inverse Square law (ISL) and
Equivalence Principle (EP) at ranges of meters and the Earth radius, G-dot and the
absolute value of G with unprecedented accuracies.
We studied many aspects of the SEE-project [11, 12] and the general conclusion
is that realization of the SEE-project may improve our knowledge of G, G-dot and
G(r) by 3-4 orders.
Another laboratory variant was suggested in our paper [80] to test possible range
variations of G. It is the experiment on possible detection of new forces, or test
of the inverse square law, parameterized by Yukawa-type potential with strength
Œ± and range Œª.
The installation comprises a ball with a spherical cavity whose
28

center is shifted with respect to the ball center. The ball is placed on a turn-table
being rotated uniformly. Torsion balance as a sensitive element is inside the cavity.
Uniform gravitational Ô¨Åeld created inside the ball do not inÔ¨Çuence the balance,
but any non-gravitational forces create a torque, which acts periodically during
the rotation of the ball. The spectrum of harmonics was calculated. It is shown
that preferable to use the Ô¨Årst harmonic in the measurements. Sensitivity of the
method was evaluated, which is limited by uncertainties due to manufacturing of
elements and temperature Ô¨Çuctuations of the sensitive element. It was shown that
the sensitivity of the method suggested may be on the level of Œ± - 10‚àí10 in the range
of Œª - (0.1 ‚àí107)m in the space of Yukawa parameters (Œ±, Œª).
Our recent results on theoretical models with variations of G, FPC, billiards,
solutions with branes and black branes as well as transition to new SI units see also
in [85, 87], [86], [88], [89, 92] and [91, 93] correspondingly.

Tensor-scalar theories of gravitation in the context of 
modern cosmology

Recently discovered accelerated expansion of the Universe is of 
current interest in theoretical research on the evolution of the Universe. The 
cause of this behavior is presumably the presence of dark energy, which has 
been estimated to form up to 70% of the universe and generates a ‚Äúrepulsive 
gravitational force‚Äù. In this paper we present the approach based on tensor-
scalar theories. After the discussion of the action for Tensor-scalar (TS) 
theories, we will describe conformal correspondence between JBD and 
Einstein theories. Cosmological models are considered in the framework of the 
Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) theory in the Einstein frame. The cases of scalar 
field, the cosmological constant and the matter, being described by the 
equation of state P= (P is the pressure,  is the energy density), are 
separately discussed. The analysis of obtained results is carried out in the light 
of modern observational data. It is shown that, in the case of q=-1/2 (q is the 
‚Äúdeceleration‚Äù parameter), the contributions of the scalar field and the 
cosmological constant  (>0) compensate each other, thus leading to 
Einstein‚Äôs theory. 
 
 
      1. Introduction 
 
      In the present paper, first we will briefly speak about the problems of the 
modern cosmology raised after new observational data, and then we will mention 
approaches and theories created to solve these problems, and finally we will pick 
up from these theories tensor-scalar one and discuss it in detail. 
      What are the most exiting points in cosmology?  Of course, we can point out at 
least 4 problems related with the words Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Large scale 
structure, and Inflation[1-7]. In the Fig. 1 the universe evolution is shown as a 
result of recent cosmological observational data and theory. One can see in the first 
stage of the universe evolution the inflation, exponential expansion of the universe, 
the existence of which is demanded by observations and theory, then another 
accelerating expanding stage of the universe evolution in the late epoch takes 
place. These both stages need to be explained by new theories, introducing a new 
type of field or by changing the action of General Relativity (GR).

      From Fig. 2, we can see how the observed rotational curves for stars far from 
the Galaxy center differ from those predicted by Newtonian gravity. The dark 
matter or alternative theories of gravity are coming to help somehow explain this 
behavior [8-13].

      Modern cosmological observations of the large scale structure (LSS), Ia type 
supernova and cosmic microwave background (CMB) voted about current 
acceleration of the Universe expansion. As an illustration, in the Fig. 3 we present 
the data coming from Ia type supernova observations. One of the most popular 
theoretical explanations of the accelerated expansion is related with the 
consideration of a non-gravitational source (dark energy) for which +3P<0 ( is 
the energy density and P is the pressure). The positive cosmological constant is the 
simplest source of this type.  
     An alternative approach for the explanation of the accelerated expansion is 
based on the use of theories of gravity different from GR. Among the most popular 
alternatives are tensor-scalar (TS) theories. There are several motivations for this. 
In particular, superstring theories lead to TS theories in the low-energy limit. TS 
theories also provide a solution for the graceful exit problem from the inflationary 
stage to the radiation dominated phase. 
     In the first part of the present paper we will give a general introduction to TS 
theories. The conformal relation between GR and Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) 
theory is discussed. The remained part of the paper is devoted to the investigation 
of cosmological models considered in the Einstein frame of JBD theory, in the 
phase dominated by a scalar field, and also in the presence of the cosmological 
constant and the matter described by the barotropic equation of state P=. The 
analysis of the obtained results is done by comparing with the modern 
observational data. It is shown that for q=1/2 (q is the deceleration parameter) the 
contributions of the scalar field and the -term (>0) compensate each other and 
the situation becomes similar to that for the GR.

      2. Conformal correspondence of the JBD and GR theories 
   
       Let suppose that in the same manyfold two conformally related Reimann

Besides the mathematical content we try to give a physical interpretation to 
conformal transformation (2.1) by relating it with the scale transformation of units 
of measurements.   
The idea of relationship between different systems of units for physical 
quantities and the local conformal transformations goes back to Weil [14], 
Eddington [15], Dicke [16]. It is natural to assume that the universal constants such 
as the speed of light and the Planck constant are invariant under conformal 
transformations:

We also assume that those 1-forms in the definition of which does not appear the 
metric tensor are unchanged under the transformations (2.1), for example 
¬µ
¬µ
A
A =
 
for the potential of the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, the components of 
the 4-velocity are transformed according to

It is easy to establish the relationship between physical quantities of different units

and 
so 
on. 
It is pertinent to note that if we postulate the conformal invariance of 
electrodynamics, then such a requirement would be the conservation of the speed 
of light, the size of the elementary charge

the electromagnetic field with respect to the conformal transformation.  
 Let us suppose that the metric tensor obeys the equations of TS theory of 
gravity, which are obtained as a result of the variations of the action

      3. Cosmological Scalar in the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory  
 
      In this section the cosmological problem in the proper representation of the 
JBD theory is considered in presence of a non-minimally coupled scalar field. As it 
will be shown the introduction of the cosmological scalar provides a possibility for 
the transition from the decelerated expansion of the Universe to the accelerated 
one. It was noted in [17-23] that the modern conceptions of the Universe give rise 
to the introduction of the cosmological constant in the GR, therefore it is worth to 
introduce a similar quantity in the JBD theory. Having assumed that the field 
corresponding to this quantity should be scalar but cannot be dynamical (its 
changes should be controlled by the gravitational scalar

So we can see how due to the conformal transformation we got the action with a

framework of the considered model during the certain period of time, when

Then the situation changes in a way that q becomes positive [24]. It is natural to 
assume that at some intermediate moment of time, q becomes zero. According to 
our estimations it occurs when

       Let us try to find the dynamical picture for the time variation of the scale factor 
a(t). In Ref. [26] exact analytical expressions for a(t) are obtained for some cases 
of the equation of state. We rewrite these relations using the above-mentioned 
notations. For the function q(t) it is convenient to use the formula

         Now we can estimate the age of the Universe. For the light coming from a 
stellar object, the redshift is typical, which is due to the expansion of the Universe. 
The wavelength increases linearly proportional to the scale factor a(t). This effect 
can be described by introducing the redshift z:

The standard cosmological model is investigated within the framework of the 
Einstein frame of JBD theory, from the viewpoint of the contribution of different 
components‚Äô energy densities. It is shown that for the value q =-1/2 (estimated by 
the WMAP experiment [27]) contributions of the energies due to the scalar field 
and Œõ-term, compensate each other and the expansion occurs by the scheme similar 
to that in GR. In the future, when this condition is violated, the parameter q

As a result of this work, it is worthwhile to present the time dependences of a(t) 
and H (t) in order to qualitatively describe the dynamics of the Universe evolution  
44 

 in the limited case of minimally-coupled scalar and tensor fields. As can be seen in 
Fig. 4, where the dependence of effective stellar magnitude on the redshift is 
depicted, the theoretical curve is closer to the observational data in the case of 
bigger values of 
o

‚Ñ¶. Here we used the observational data for Ia type supernovae 
[28,29]. For a more complete picture of the Universe evolution, in Fig. 3, we also 
present the dependence on time for the different contributions. The red curve

represents the

 is obvious. According 
to our cosmological model, the transition of the Universe expansion from a 
decelerating to an accelerating one can be realized as shown in Fig. 6. One can also 
see the behavior of the Hubble rate.

        4. Conclusion 
 
        In the first part of this work the cosmological model with non-minimally 
coupled scalar field is considered in the presence of a cosmological scalar =y/y0 
in the proper frame of the JBD theory. The cosmological scalar is chosen similar to 
that in the Einstein frame, where it becomes a cosmological constant. It is shown 
that in this case, a phase with an accelerated expansion appears in the scale of 
cosmological times. 
        The corresponding action has the form (2.3) and we have considered a special 
case of the function

. With this choice the gravitational part of the 
JBD action in the Eisntein frame coincides with that in GR and the cosmological 
expansion in the Jordan frame is always decelerated. When the cosmological scalar 
is present in the case of non-minimally coupled scalar field, the Universe with 
transition from the phase of the decelerated expansion to the accelerated expansion 
phase is realized. At late stages we have an exponential expansion and the scalar 
field tends to a constant value. In the case of minimally coupled scalar field the 
situation is basically the same. In the second part, a cosmological model of the 
Universe is considered in the Einstein frame of JBD theory in the presence of the 
cosmological constant. The obtained analytical results are in agreement with 
modern observational data about the expansion of the Universe. From the presented 
results we can see the change of the sign for the ‚Äúdeceleration‚Äù parameter which 
describes the transition from the decelerated expansion to the to accelerated one 
near the present time.

This paper is based on the modified Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) tensor-
scalar theory. By taking into account the importance of vacuum effects in recent 
cosmology, we consider cosmological models with a scalar field and the vacuum 
energy in various conformal frames of the JBD theory.  
 
 
       1. Introduction 
 
       Recent observational data on the expansion of the universe raised a number of 
problems for cosmological investigations. The observations of supernovae and 
cosmic microwave background [1-4] indicate that the universe is accelerating. 
Within the framework of General Relativity this requires a special type of the 
energy source for this expansion with the equation of state close to the one for 
cosmological constant. Other classes of models are based on slowly varying scalar 
fields dominating at large scales. In the present paper we consider cosmological 
models within the framework of so called Einstein frame for Jordan tensor-scalar 
theory [5], when the scalar field is minimally coupled to the tensor field, and in the 
proper frame of this theory with self-consistent scalar field [6]. In the first case the 
cosmological constant Œõ is responsible for the effects related to the vacuum 
energy. In the second case, in analogy with Œõ , we introduce a cosmological scalar 
)
(y
œï
, which as a result of special conformal transformation goes to Œõ  in the 
Einstein frame.  It is well-known that quantum vacuum effects may be responsible 
for the cosmological constant Œõ . In the early de Sitter stage of the cosmological 
expansion 
4
~ H
Œõ
 with H  being the Hubble constant, whereas the vacuum 
energy, induced by the QCD condensate at late stages of the evolution, is of the 
order ~ H  [7-9].  
 
In accordance with the abovementioned, at the first step it makes sense to 
ignore a possible contribution from other forms of energy and to consider the role 
of  Œõ  in the Einstein frame and the role of a cosmological scalar in the modified 
version of JBD theory.

         3. Conclusion 
 
In the present paper we have tried to construct classical cosmological 
models by taking into account the vacuum energy. It is based on considerations 
related to that at the quantum field-theoretical level the vacuum energy is 
responsible for the cosmological constant   in the classical theory of gravity [14] 
and   can be taken proportional to the power of the Hubble parameter, 
n
H (the 
exponent n  depends on the stage of evolution under consideration). 
We have considered various variants of cosmological models within the 
framework of Jordan‚Äôs modified tensor-scalar theory. It is assumed that the 
cosmological scalar 
( )
y
œï
 in the Lagrangian is related to vacuum effects. The 
cases of dominating scalar field are considered by taking into account the vacuum 
energy for FRW models with flat space. First, the problem is presented within the 
framework of the Einstein frame for the Jordan theory, in which  ( )
y
œï
 transforms 
to the usual cosmological constant  . In this frame, the minimally coupled scalar 
field allows to write the field equations through the quantities which play the role 
of contributions of densities for various types of energy [15]. As a result, the 
interpretation of the obtained results becomes simpler and is reduced to that, first, 
the accelerated expansion is possible only for and, second, at late stages of the 
evolution the Hubble constant H  is related to   in the form  

3
H =
. Further, 
the analog problem is considered in the proper frame of the modified variant for 
Jordan‚Äôs theory. Here, on the base of the relation obtained before for H  and   , 
we have taken the cosmological scalar in the form 
( )
2
y
H
œï
Œ±
=
. As a result, the 
accelerated expansion is realized if 2

Abstract
In this paper we analyze induced self-interactions for point-like particles with
electric and scalar charges placed at rest in the spacetime of a global monopole
admitting a general spherically symmetric inner structure to it. In order to
develop this analysis we calculate the three-dimensional Green function asso-
ciated with the physical system under consideration. As we shall see for the
charged particle outside the monopole core, the corresponding Green functions
are composed by two distinct contributions, the Ô¨Årsts ones are induced by the
non-trivial topology of the global monopole considered as a point-like defect
and the seconds are corrections induced by the non-vanishing inner structure
attributed to it. For both cases, the self-energies present a similar structure,
having also two distinct contributions as well. For a speciÔ¨Åc model considered
for region inside the monopole, named Ô¨Çower-pot, we shall see that the particle
with electric charge will be always subject to a repulsive self-force with respect
to the monopole core‚Äôs boundary, on the other scalar charged particle exhibits
peculiar behavior. Depending on the curvature coupling the self-force can be
repulsive or attractive with respect to the core‚Äôs boundary. Moreover, the con-
tribution due to the point-like global monopole vanishes for massless particle
conformally coupled with three dimensional space section of the manifold, and
the only contribution comes from the core-induced part.
1. Introduction
It is well known that diÔ¨Äerent types of topological objects may have been formed
by the vacuum phase transition in the early Universe after Planck time [1, 2]. These
include domain walls, cosmic strings and monopoles. Global monopoles are heavy
spherically symmetric topological objects which may have been formed by the vac-
uum phase transition in the early Universe after Planck time. Although the global
monopole was Ô¨Årst introduced by Sokolov and Starobinsky in [3], its gravitational
eÔ¨Äects has been analyzed by Barriola and Vilenkin [4]. In the latter it is shown that

for points far away from the monopole‚Äôs center, the geometry of the spacetime can
be given by the line element below:
ds2 = ‚àídt2 + dr2 + Œ±2r2(dŒ∏2 + sin2 Œ∏dœï2) .
(1)
In (1) the parameter Œ±2, which is smaller than unity, depends on the energy scale Œ∑
where the phase transition spontaneously occur. This spacetime has a non-vanishing
scalar curvature, R = 2(1‚àíŒ±2)
Œ±2r2
and presents a solid angle deÔ¨Åcit Œ¥‚Ñ¶= 4œÄ2(1 ‚àíŒ±2).
Although the geometric properties of the spacetime outside the monopole are
very well understood, there are no explicit expressions for the components of the
metric tensor in the region inside. Consequently many interesting investigations of
physical eÔ¨Äects associated with global monopole consider this object as a point-like
defect. Adopting this simpliÔ¨Åed model, many calculations of vacuum polarization ef-
fects associated with bosonic [5] and fermionic quantum Ô¨Åelds [6], in four-dimensional
global monopole spacetime, present divergence on the monopole‚Äôs core.
A very well known phenomenon that occur with an electric charged test par-
ticle placed at rest in a curved spacetime, is that it may become subjected to an
electrostatic self-interactions. The origin of this induced self-interaction resides on
the non-local structure of the Ô¨Åeld caused by the spacetime curvature and/or non-
trivial topology. This phenomenon has been analyzed in an idealized cosmic string
spacetime by Linet [7] and Smith [8], independently, and also in the spacetime of
a global monopole considered as a point-like defect in [9]. In these analysis, the
corresponding self-forces are always repulsive; moreover they present divergences
on the respective defects‚Äô core. A possible way to avoid the divergence problem is
to consider these defects as having a non-vanishing radius, and attributing for the
region inside a structure. For the cosmic string, two diÔ¨Äerent models have been
adopted to describe the geometry inside it: the ballpoint-pen model proposed in-
dependently by Gott and Hiscock [10], replaces the conical singularity at the string
axis by a constant curvature spacetime in the interior region, and Ô¨Çower-pot model
[11], presents the curvature concentrated on a ring with the spacetime inside the
string been Ô¨Çat. Khusnutdinov and Bezerra in [12], revisited the induced electro-
static self-energy problem considering the Hiscock and Gott model for the region
inside the string. As to the global monopole the electrostatic self-energies problem
have been analyzed considering for the region inside, the Ô¨Çower-pot model in [13]
and ballpoint pen in [14]. In both analysis it was observed that the corresponding
self-forces are Ô¨Ånite at the monopole‚Äôs core center.
In the context of self-interactions the induced self-energy on scalar charged point-
like particles on a curved spacetime reveals peculiarities [15, 16] due to the non-
minimal curvature coupling with the geometry.
In the case of of Schwarzschild
spacetime, the self-force on a scalar charged particle at rest vanishes for minimal
coupling [17]. The self-energy on scalar particle on the global monopole spacetime
considering a non-trivial inner structure been developed recently in [18].
In this present paper, mainly supported by two previous publications, [13, 18], we
shall analyze the self-interaction problems associate with electric and scalar charged
56

particles placed at rest in the global monopole spacetime, considering a non-trivial
structure for the region inside to it. This paper is organized as follows: In section 2
we present the model to consider the geometry of the global in the whole space and
the relevant Ô¨Åeld equations associated with the electric and scalar charged particles
placed at rest in this background. We calculate the eÔ¨Äective three-dimensional Green
functions for points outside and inside the monopole‚Äôs core. As a consequence, we
provide a general expression for the electrostatic and scalar self-energies and their
related self-forces. In section 3 we calculate explicit expressions for the self-energies
considering, as application of previous formalism, the Ô¨Çower-pot model for the region
inside the monopole.
Finally in section 4, we present our conclusions and more
relevant remarks.
2. The system
Many investigations concerning physical eÔ¨Äects around a global monopole are
developed considering it as idealized point-like defect. In this way the geometry of
the spacetime is described by line element (1) for all values of the radial coordinate.
However, a realistic model for a global monopole should present a non-vanishing
characteristic core radius. For example, considering the model proposed by Barriola
and Vilenkin [4], the line element given by (1) is attained for the radial coordinate
much lager than its characteristic core radius, which depends on the inverse of the
energy scale where the global O(3) symmetry is spontaneously broken to U(1).
Explicit expressions for the components of the metric tensor in whole space have
not yet been found. Here, in this paper we shall not go into the details about this
calculation. Instead, we shall consider a spherically symmetric model for describing
the metric tensor for the region inside the shell of radius a. In the exterior region
corresponding to r > a, the line element is given by (1), while in the interior region,
r < a, the geometry is described by the static spherically symmetric line element
ds2 = ‚àídt2 + v2(r)dr2 + w2(r)(dŒ∏2 + sin2 Œ∏dœï2) .
(2)
Because the metric tensor must be continuous at the boundary of the core, the
functions v(r) and w(r) must satisfy the conditions
v(a) = 1 and w(a) = Œ±a .
(3)
2.1. Self-interactions
In this subsection we shall develop a general formalism to analysis self-interactions
associated with electric and scalar charged particles in global monopole spacetime.
2.1.1. Electrostatic self-interaction
Here we investigate the electrostatic self-energy and the self-force for a point-like
charged particle at rest, induced by the spacetime geometry associated with a global
57

monopole with the core of Ô¨Ånite radius. We shall assume that in the region inside
the monopole core the geometry is described by line element (2), and in the exterior
region we have the standard line element (1). From the Maxwell equations, the
covariant components of the electromagnetic four-vector potential, A¬µ, obey the
equation below,
‚àÇŒª
h‚àö‚àígg¬µŒΩgŒªœÉ (‚àÇŒΩAœÉ ‚àí‚àÇœÉAŒΩ)
i
= ‚àí4œÄ‚àö‚àígj¬µ,
(4)
where j¬µ is the four-vector electric current density.
For a point-like particle at
rest with coordinates ‚Éór0 = (r0, Œ∏0, œï0), in the coordinate system corresponding to
the line element (2), the static four-vector current and potential are expressed by:
j¬µ = (j0, 0, 0, 0) and AœÉ = (A0, 0, 0, 0). The only nontrivial equation of (4) is ¬µ = 0
with
j0(x) = qŒ¥(3)(‚Éór ‚àí‚Éór0)
‚àö‚àíg
,
(5)
where q is the electric charge of the particle. In the spherically symmetric spacetime
deÔ¨Åned by (2), the diÔ¨Äerential equation obeyed by A0 is:
¬∑
‚àÇr
¬µw2
uv ‚àÇr
¬∂
‚àív
u
‚ÉóL2
¬∏
A0 = ‚àí4œÄq
sin Œ∏Œ¥(‚Éór ‚àí‚Éór0) ,
(6)
with ‚ÉóL being the operator orbital angular momentum. The solution of this equa-
tion can be written in terms of the Green function associated with the diÔ¨Äerential
operator deÔ¨Åned by the left-hand side, as follows:
A0(‚Éór) = 4œÄqG(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(7)
with the equation for the Green function
¬∑
‚àÇr
¬µw2
uv ‚àÇr
¬∂
‚àív
u
‚ÉóL2
¬∏
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = ‚àíŒ¥(r ‚àír0)
sin Œ∏
Œ¥(Œ∏ ‚àíŒ∏0)Œ¥(œï ‚àíœï0) .
(8)
Having the electrostatic self-potential for the charge we can evaluate the corre-
sponding self-force by using the standard formula
fi
el(‚Éór0) = ‚àíqgikFkmum = ‚àíqgik
u ‚àÇkA0|‚Éór=‚Éór0 = ‚àí4œÄq2 gik
u
lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éór0 [‚àÇkG(‚Éór,‚Éór0)] .
(9)
An alternative way to obtain the self-force is to consider Ô¨Årst the electrostatic self-
energy given by [7, 8]
Uel(‚Éór0) = qA0(‚Éór0)/2 = 2œÄq2 lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éór0 G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(10)
and then to derive the force on the base of the formula
fi
el(‚Éór0) = ‚àígik
u ‚àÇkUel(‚Éór0) .
(11)
58

In (9) and (10) the limit provides a divergent result. To obtain a Ô¨Ånite and well
deÔ¨Åned result for the self-force, we should apply some renormalization procedure
for the Green function. The procedure that we shall adopt is the standard one: we
subtract from the Green function the terms in the corresponding DeWitt-Schwinger
adiabatic expansion which are divergent in the coincidence limit. So, we deÔ¨Åne the
renormalized Green function as
Gren(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ‚àíGSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0) .
(12)
In this way the renormalized self-energy, Uel,ren(‚Éór0), and self-force, fi
el,ren(‚Éór0), are
obtained by the formulas (9) and (10) substituting G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) by Gren(‚Éór,‚Éór0). Note
that here the subtraction of the divergent part of the Green function corresponds to
the renormalization of the particle mass.
Taking into account the spherical symmetry of the problem, we may express the
Green function by the ansatz below,
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) =
‚àû
X
l=0
l
X
m=‚àíl
gl(r, r0)Y m
l (Œ∏, œï)Y m‚àó
l
(Œ∏0, œï0) ,
(13)
with Y m
l (Œ∏, œï) being the ordinary spherical harmonics. Substituting (13) into (8)
and using the well known addition theorem for the spherical harmonics, we arrive
at the diÔ¨Äerential equation for the unknown radial function:
¬∑ d
dr
¬µw2
uv
d
dr
¬∂
‚àív
ul(l + 1)
¬∏
gl(r, r0) = ‚àíŒ¥(r ‚àír0) .
(14)
As the functions u(r), v(r) and w(r) are continuous at r = a, from (14) it follows that
the function gl(r, r0) and its Ô¨Årst radial derivative are also continuous at this point.
The function gl(r, r0) is also continuous at r = r0. The discontinuity condition of
the Ô¨Årst radial derivative at r = r0 is obtained by the integration of (14) about this
point. It reads,
dgl(r, r0)
dr
|r=r0+ ‚àídgl(r, r0)
dr
|r=r0‚àí= ‚àíu(r0)v(r0)
w2(r0)
.
(15)
Let us denote by R1l(r) and R2l(r) the two linearly independent solutions of the
homogeneous equation corresponding to (14) in the region inside the monopole‚Äôs
core. We shall assume that the function R1l(r) is regular at the core center r = rc
and that the solutions are normalized by the Wronskian relation
R1l(r)R‚Ä≤
2l(r) ‚àíR‚Ä≤
1l(r)R2l(r) = ‚àíu(r)v(r)
w2(r)
.
(16)
In the region outside the core the linearly independent solutions to the corresponding
homogeneous equation are the functions rŒª1 and rŒª2, where
Œª1,2 = ‚àí1
2 ¬± 1
2Œ±
p
Œ±2 + 4l(l + 1) .
(17)
59

Now, we can write gl(r, r0) as a function of the radial coordinate r in the sepa-
rate regions [rc, min(r0, a)), (min(r0, a), max(r0, a)), and (max(r0, a), ‚àû) as a linear
combination of the above mentioned solutions with arbitrary coeÔ¨Écients. The re-
quirement of the regularity at the core center and at the inÔ¨Ånity reduces the number
of these coeÔ¨Écients to four. They are determined by the continuity condition at the
monopole‚Äôs core boundary and by the matching conditions at r = r0. In this way
we Ô¨Ånd the following expressions
gl(r, r0)

have used the notation

jl(a) ‚àíŒªjRjl(a)
aR‚Ä≤
1l(a) ‚àíŒª2R1l(a) , j = 1, 2 .
(22)
First let us consider the case when the charge is outside the monopole‚Äôs core
(r0 > a).
Substituting the function (19) into (13), we observe that the Green
function is presented in the form of the sum of two terms
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = Gm(‚Éór,‚Éór0) + Gc(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(23)
where

is induced by non-trivial structure of the core. In formulas (24) and (25), the Œ≥ is the
angle between the directions (Œ∏, œï) and (Œ∏0, œï0), and Pl(x) represents the Legendre
polynomials. As we can see, the contribution (25) depends on the structure of the
core through the radial function R1l(r).
60

As we have already mentioned, the induced self-energy is obtained from the
renormalized Green function taking the coincidence limit. We can observe that for
points with r > a, the core-induced term (25) is Ô¨Ånite in the coincidence limit and
the divergence appears in the point-like monopole part only. So, in order to provide a
Ô¨Ånite and well deÔ¨Åned value to (10), we have to renormalize Green function Gm(‚Éór,‚Éór0)
only:
Gren(r0, r0) = Gm,ren(r0, r0) + Gc(r0, r0) .
(26)
As explained before, to obtain Gm,ren(r0, r0), we subtract from (24) the terms in
the corresponding DeWitt-Schwinger adiabatic expansion which are divergent in the
coincidence limit:
Gm,ren(r0, r0) = lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éór0 [Gm(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ‚àíGSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0)] .
(27)
The part GSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0) is found from the general formula given, for instance, in [19].
For simplicity, taking the separation of the points along the radial direction only
(Œ≥ = 0), we Ô¨Ånd
GSing(r, r0) =
1
4œÄ|r ‚àír0| .
(28)
Now, by using formulas (24) and (28), one obtains
Gm,ren(r0, r0) =

(30)
On the basis of this relation, replacing 1/(1 ‚àít) in (29) by the Ô¨Årst term in the
brackets in (30), we Ô¨Ånd
Gm,ren(r0, r0) = S(Œ±)
4œÄr0

(32)
The function S(Œ±) is positive (negative) for Œ± < 1 (Œ± > 1) and, hence, the corre-
sponding self-force is repulsive (attractive).
Combining formulas (10), (25) and (31), for the renormalized electrostatic self-
energy we obtain

(33)

As we can see, the second term of the renormalized self-energy provides a convergent
series for r0 > a. Moreover, the dependence of the self-energy on the core structure
is present in the function D1l(a). For large distances from the core, r0 ‚â´a, the
main contribution into the core-induced part comes from the term l = 0 and one
has

(35)
According to the symmetry of the problem, the self-force has only a radial compo-
nent.
Now let us study the case when the charge is inside the core, r0 < a.
The
corresponding Green function is obtained from (20) and is written in the form
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = G0(‚Éór,‚Éór0) + GŒ±(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(36)

(2l + 1)R1l(r0)R1l(r)D2l(a)Pl(cos Œ≥) ,
(38)
is due to the global monopole geometry in the region r > a. For the points away
from the core boundary the latter is Ô¨Ånite in the coincidence limit. The self-energy
for the charge inside the core is written in the form
Uel,ren(r0) = 2œÄq2G0,ren(r0, r0) ‚àíq2

where
G0,ren(r0, r0) = lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éór0 [G0(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ‚àíGSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0)] .
(40)
The only contribution in the divergent part of the Green function comes from the
Ô¨Årst term of the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion. Note that near the center of the core
one has R1l(r0) ‚àù(r0 ‚àírc)l and the main contribution into the second term on the
right of (39) comes from the term with l = 0. Substituting the self-energy given by
(39) into formula (11), we obtain the self-force for the charge inside the monopole
core.

where the Ô¨Årst part contains the Klein-Gordon action admitting an arbitrary cur-
vature coupling, Œæ, and the second part contains the interaction term. In the above
equation R represents the scalar curvature. The Ô¨Åeld equation can be obtained by
varying the action with respect to the Ô¨Åeld. This provides
¬°
‚ñ°‚àíŒæR ‚àím2¬¢
œÜ = ‚àíœÅ .
(42)
The physical system that we shall analyze corresponds to a particle at rest;
so, there is no time dependence on the Ô¨Åeld. Moreover, because the metric tensor
under consideration is also time-independent, the equation of motion above reduces
eÔ¨Äectively to a three-dimensional one:
¬°
‚àá2 ‚àíŒæR ‚àím2¬¢
œÜ = ‚àíœÅ .
(43)
The energy-momentum tensor associated with this system is obtained by taking
the variation of (41) with respect to the metric tensor. It reads

‚àö‚àígŒ¥3(‚Éór ‚àí‚Éór0) .
(49)
Finally substituting (49) into (48), we obtain for the energy the following ex-
pression:
E = ‚àíq2
2 G(‚Éór0,‚Éór0) .
(50)
Here also, the evaluation of the Green function that we need for the calculation
of the energy is divergent at the coincidence limit. In order to obtain a Ô¨Ånite and well
deÔ¨Åned result for the energy we subtract from the Green function the corresponding
DeWitt-Schwinger asymptotic expansion. Following the general procedure given in
[19], the singular behavior of the three-dimensional Green function associated with
a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld reads:
GSing(x, x‚Ä≤) = 1
4œÄ
¬∑

‚àö
2œÉ ‚àím
¬∏
+ O(œÉ) .
(51)
Adopting the above mentioned renormalization approach, the scalar self-energy is
given by
ERen

2 GRen(‚Éór0,‚Éór0) ,
=
‚àíq2
2 lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éór0[G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ‚àíGSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0)] .
(52)
Once more, taking into account the spherical symmetry of the problem, the
scalar Green function can be expressed by the ansatz below,
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) =
‚àû

(53)
Substituting (53) into (47), we arrive at the following diÔ¨Äerential equation for the
unknown radial function gl(r, r‚Ä≤):

R = 2
w2 + 4v‚Ä≤w‚Ä≤
wv3 ‚àí4w‚Ä≤‚Ä≤
wv2 ‚àí2(w‚Ä≤)2
w2v2 .
(55)
For Œæ = 0 and m = 0 the diÔ¨Äerential equation above is similar to the previous one
found in the analysis of electrostatic self-energy, Eq.
(14).
Moreover; as to the
solution of (54) the junctions conditions are obtained as explain below:
64

‚Ä¢ Because the function v(r) and w(r) are continuous at r = a, it follows that
gl(r, r‚Ä≤) should be continuous at this point; however, due to the second radial
derivative of the function w(r) in the Ricci scalar, a Dirac-delta function con-
tribution on the Ricci scalar takes place if the Ô¨Årst derivative of this function
is not continuous at the boundary.1 Naming by ÀáR = ¬ØRŒ¥(r ‚àía) the Dirac-delta
contribution of the Ricci scalar, the junction condition on the boundary is:
dgl(r)
dr
|r=a+ ‚àídgl(r)
dr
|r=a‚àí= Œæ ¬ØR gl(a) .
(56)
‚Ä¢ The function gl(r) is continuous at r = r0, however by integrating (54) about
this point, the Ô¨Årst radial derivative of this function obeys the junction condi-
tion below:
dgl(r)
dr
|r=r+
0 ‚àídgl(r)
dr
|r=r‚àí
0 = ‚àív(r0)
w2(r0) .
(57)
Now after this general discussion, let us analyze the solutions of the homoge-
neous diÔ¨Äerential equation associated with (54) for regions inside and outside the
monopole‚Äôs core. Let us denote by R1l(r) and R2l(r) the two linearly independent
solutions of the equation in the region inside with R1l(r) been the regular one at the
core center r = rc; moreover, we shall assume that solutions are normalized by the
Wronskian relation (16).
In the region outside, the two linearly independent solution are:
1
‚àörIŒΩl(mr) and
1
‚àörKŒΩl(mr) ,
(58)
where IŒΩ and KŒΩ are the modiÔ¨Åed Bessel functions of order
ŒΩl = 1
2Œ±
p
(2l + 1)2 + (1 ‚àíŒ±2)(8Œæ ‚àí1) .
(59)
Now we can write the function gl(r) as a linear combination of the above solutions
with arbitrary coeÔ¨Écients for the regions (rc, min(r0, a)), (min(r0, a), max(r0, a)),
and (max(r0, a), ‚àû). The requirement of the regularity at the core center and at
the inÔ¨Ånity reduces the number of these coeÔ¨Écients to four. These constants are
determined by the continuity condition at the monopole‚Äôs core boundary and at the
point r = r0 by the junctions conditions given in (56) and (57), respectively. In this
way we Ô¨Ånd the following expressions:

For a given function F(z), we use the notation

(66)
and for a solution Rjl(r), with j = 1, 2,
R(j)

(67)
In the above deÔ¨Ånition R‚Ä≤

Before to go for a speciÔ¨Åc model, let us still continue the investigation of the
self-energy for this general spherically symmetric spacetime. First we shall consider
the case where the charge is outside the monopole‚Äôs core. Substituting (61) into (53)
we see that the Green function is expressed in terms of two contributions:
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = Ggm(‚Éór,‚Éór0) + Gc(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(68)
where
Ggm(‚Éór,‚Éór0) =

l=0

‚àû
X
l=0
(2l + 1)D(+)
l
(a)KŒΩl(mr0)KŒΩl(mr)Pl(cos Œ≥) .
(70)
The Ô¨Årst part corresponds to the Green function for the geometry of a point-like
global monopole and the second is induced by the non-trivial structure of its core.
In the formulas above, Œ≥ is the angle between both directions (Œ∏, œï) and (Œ∏0, œï0)
and Pl(x) represents the Legendre polynomials of degree l.
66

The induced scalar self-energy is obtained by taking the coincidence limit in the
renormalized Green function. We can observe that for points with r > a, the core-
induced term (70) is Ô¨Ånite and the divergence appears in the point-like monopole
part only. So, in order to provide a Ô¨Ånite and well deÔ¨Åned result for (52), we have
to renormalize the Green function Ggm(‚Éór,‚Éór0) only. Let us Ô¨Årst take Œ≥ = 0 in the
above expressions. The renormalized Green function is expressed by:
GRen(r0, r0) = Ggm,ren(r0, r0) + Gc(r0, r0) ,
(71)
where
Ggm,ren(r0, r0) = lim
r‚Üír0[Ggm(r, r0) ‚àíGSing(r, r0)] .
(72)
For points outside the core, the radial one-half of geodesic distance becomes |r‚àír0|/2,
we have
GSing(r, r0) = 1
4œÄ
¬∑

|r ‚àír0| ‚àím

(73)
Now, by using Gm(r0, r) given in (69), we have:

where t = r</r>. In order to evaluate the limit on the right hand side of the above
equation, we take the identity (30). So, as consequence of this relation and replacing
in (74) the expression 1/(1 ‚àít) by the Ô¨Årst term in the brackets of that identity, we
Ô¨Ånd
Ggm,ren(r‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤) = S(Œ±)(mr‚Ä≤)

(76)
Two special situations deserve to be analyzed:
‚Ä¢ For the case where Œæ = 0, we have ŒΩl =
1
2Œ±
p
4l(l + 1) + Œ±2. Taking the limit
m ‚Üí0 in (76), using [20, 21] we get a position independent expression named
SŒ±:
SŒ± =

l=0

2l + 1
p
4l(l + 1) + Œ±2 ‚àí1
#
.
(77)
Up to a factor 1/Œ± this expression coincides with the similar one obtained in
the previous analysis of the electrostatic self-energy, Eq (32).
‚Ä¢ For Œæ = 1/8 we have ŒΩl =
1
2Œ±(2l + 1). Taking the limit m ‚Üí0 in (76) we see
that the term inside the bracket vanishes, consequently Ggm,ren(r‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤) = 0 and
the only contribution to the scalar self-energy comes from the core-induced
part (70). In fact under these circumstance, the diÔ¨Äerential equation obeyed
67

by the Green function in the region outside the monopole is conformally related
with the corresponding one in a Ô¨Çat space due to the conformal Ô¨Çatness of the
space section of this metric tensor:
d‚Éól2 = dr2 + Œ±2r2d‚Ñ¶(2) = œÅŒª(dœÅ2 + œÅ2d‚Ñ¶(2)) ,
(78)
with œÅ = (Œ±r)1/Œ± being Œª = 2(Œ± ‚àí1). Moreover, by explicit calculation we can
show that Ggm(‚Éór,‚Éór‚Ä≤) = œÅ‚àíŒª/4GM(‚ÉóœÅ, ‚ÉóœÅ‚Ä≤)œÅ‚Ä≤‚àíŒª/4.

The second analysis that can be formally developed here, is related with the
case when the charge is inside the core. The corresponding Green function can be
written in the form
G(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = G0(‚Éór,‚Éór0) + GŒ±(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ,
(82)
where

is due to the global monopole geometry in the region r > a. For the points away
from the core boundary the latter is Ô¨Ånite in the coincidence limit. The renormalized
scalar self-energy for the charge inside is written in the form
ERen = ‚àíq2
2 G0,Ren(‚Éór0,‚Éór0) + q2
8œÄ
‚àû
X
l=0

G0,Ren(‚Éór0,‚Éór0) = lim
‚Éór‚Üí‚Éórp [G0(‚Éór,‚Éór0) ‚àíGSing(‚Éór,‚Éór0)] .
(86)
Because the divergent part of the Green function should have the same structure as
(51), the above expression provides a Ô¨Ånite result; moreover, notice that near the
center of the core one has R1l(r) ‚âà
Il+1/2(m(r‚àírc))
‚àör‚àírc
and the main contribution into
the second term on the right of (85) comes from the term with l = 0. Finally we
can say that the self-force is again obtained by taking the negative gradient of (85).
3. Flower-pot model
As we have mentioned before, there is no closed expression for the metric tensor
in the region inside the global monopole. However, adopting the Ô¨Çower-pot model for
this region, the calculations of vacuum polarization eÔ¨Äects associated with massive
scalar and fermionic Ô¨Åelds have been developed in [22, 23], respectively. So, motived
by these result we decided, as an illustration of the general procedure described
before, to consider the Ô¨Çower-pot model in the present analysis of the induced elec-
trostatic and scalar self-interactions. For this model the interior line element has
the form [13]
ds2 = ‚àídt2 + dr2 + [r + (Œ± ‚àí1)a]2 (d2Œ∏ + sin2 Œ∏d2œï) .
(87)
In terms of the radial coordinate r the origin is located at r = rc = (1 ‚àíŒ±)a.
DeÔ¨Åning Àúr = r + (Œ± ‚àí1)a, the line element takes the standard Minkowskian form.
As we have mentioned before, from the Israel matching conditions for the metric
tensors corresponding to (1) and (87), we Ô¨Ånd the singular contribution for the scalar
curvature located on the bounding surface r = a [22]:
¬ØR = 4(1 ‚àíŒ±)
Œ±a
.
(88)
In what follows, we shall consider, separately, the analysis of electrostatic and
scalar self-interactions.
3.1. Electrostatic self-interaction
Now we can express the renormalized Green function in the region outside the
monopole core by taking into account that in the interior region we have two linearly
69

independent solutions of the homogeneous equation corresponding to (14):
R1l(r) = Àúrl , and R2l(r) = Àúr‚àíl‚àí1/(2l + 1) .
(89)
So, from formula (33), the self-energy in the exterior region reads
Uel,ren(r0)
=
q2S(Œ±)
2r0
+ 2q2(1 ‚àíŒ±)
Œ±r0

‚àö
1+4l(l+1)/Œ±2
hp
Œ±2 + 4l(l + 1) + Œ± + 2l
i2 .
(90)
The second term on the right of this formula is positive for Œ± < 1 and negative for
Œ± > 1. Combining this with the properties of the function S(Œ±) discussed in the
previous section, we conclude that the electrostatic self-energy is positive for Œ± < 1
and negative for Œ± > 1. The corresponding self-force is directly found from (35)
and is repulsive in the Ô¨Årst case and attractive in the second one. The core-induced
part in (90) diverges at the core boundary, r0 = a. Noting that for points near the
boundary the main contribution into (90) comes from large values l, to the leading
order we Ô¨Ånd
Uel,ren(r0) ‚âàq2 (Œ± ‚àí1)
8Œ±a
ln
h
1 ‚àí(a/r0)1/Œ±i
,
(91)
and the self-energy is dominated by the core-induced part.
Now we turn to the investigation of the self-energy for the particle inside the
monopole core. Substituting the functions (89) into formulas (37) and (38), for the
corresponding Green functions in the interior region one Ô¨Ånds
G0(r, r0)
=

(93)
Because in the Ô¨Çower-pot model the geometry in the region inside the monopole is
a Minkowski one, we have Gsing(‚Éór,‚Éór0) = G0(‚Éór,‚Éór0) and, hence, G0,ren(r0, r0) = 0.
Finally, the electrostatic self-energy in the region inside the monopole core reads:
Uel,ren(r0) = 2œÄq2Gren(r0, r0) = q2

(94)
As in the case of the exterior region, this self-energy is positive for Œ± < 1 and
negative for Œ± > 1. The corresponding self-force is easily found from relation (11)
and is repulsive with respect to the boundary of the monopole core in the Ô¨Årst case
and attractive in the second case. Near the core center the main contribution into
the self-energy comes from the lowest modes and one has

3.2. Scalar self-interaction
In the region inside the global monopole the two linearly independent solutions
for the homogeneous radial equation corresponding to (54) are:
R1l(r) = Il+1/2(mÀúr)
‚àö
Àúr
and R2l(r) = Kl+1/2(mÀúr)
‚àö
Àúr
.
(96)
Having obtained the above solutions, the expressions for the Green functions in
both, inside and outside regions, can be explicitly constructed, consequently the
corresponding self-energies. These expressions depend on the coeÔ¨Écients D(+)
l
(a)
and D(‚àí)

As in the Ô¨Årst analyze, let us consider the core-induced part of the self-energy
for the region outside, Eq. (79), adopting speciÔ¨Åc values for the parameter Œæ and
mass of the particle. Taking Œæ = 0, and by using [21] to obtain the behavior of all
functions contained in the coeÔ¨Écient deÔ¨Åned in (97), (98) and (100), in the limit
m ‚Üí0, we have:

(Œ± + 2l ‚àí2Œ±ŒΩl)
(2Œ±ŒΩl + Œ± + 2l)(Œì(ŒΩl))2 .
(101)
So the general term inside the summation of the core-induced part reads,
Œ±(2l + 1)
‚àö
4l2 + 4l + Œ±2
4l(Œ± ‚àí1)

(102)
Which coincides with the result obtained for the electrostatic case.
71

We can see that the core-induced part in (79) is divergent near the boundary
r = a.
In order to verify this fact, we should analyze the general term in the
summation for large value of l. Taking again the uniform asymptotic expansion
for large orders of the modiÔ¨Åed Bessel functions in D(+)(a) and the same for the
Macdonald function, KŒΩl(mr), we get,
‚àí[Œ± ‚àí2Œ±ŒΩl + 2l + 8Œæ(1 ‚àíŒ±)]
[Œ± + 2Œ±ŒΩl + 2l + 8Œæ(1 ‚àíŒ±)]

¬¥2ŒΩl .
(103)
At this point we want to mention that the contribution proportional to the curvature
coupling, Œæ, in the above expression is consequence of the delta-Dirac contribution
in the Ricci scalar, given by ŒæR, present in (67).
For large value of l we have 2Œ±ŒΩl ‚âà(2l + 1) + (1‚àíŒ±2)(8Œæ‚àí1)

Finally, after some intermediate steps we Ô¨Ånd:

32œÄŒ±a
ln
h
1 ‚àí(a/r0)1/Œ±i
.
(105)
We can see that the above result does not depend on the mass of the particle. In
fact this happens because the leading order term in the expansions of the coeÔ¨Écient
D(+)(a) there appear a power factor (ma)2ŒΩl, as to the square of the Macdonald
function KŒΩl(mr), the leading power factor in the mass is (mr)‚àí2ŒΩl. Moreover we
can see from the above result that for Œæ = 1/8 there is no divergent contribution in
the core-induced part, and that for Œæ > 1/8 this contribution becomes negative.
Now let us turn our investigation of the self-energy for the region inside the
monopole. Substituting the functions (96) into the formulas (83) and (84) for the
corresponding Green function in the interior region one Ô¨Ånds [21],
G0(‚Éór,‚Éór‚Ä≤) = 1
4œÄ
e‚àímR
R

(106)
with R =
p
(Àúr‚Ä≤)2 + (Àúr)2 ‚àí2ÀúrÀúr‚Ä≤ cos Œ≥, being Œ≥ the angle between the two directions
deÔ¨Åned by the unit vectors ÀÜÀúr‚Ä≤ and ÀÜÀúr. Taking Œ≥ = 0 we get R = |r ‚àír‚Ä≤|. Because in
the Ô¨Çower-pot model the geometry in the region inside the monopole is a Minkowski
one, we have G0(‚Éór,‚Éór‚Ä≤) = GSing(‚Éór,‚Éór‚Ä≤), consequently G0,Ren(‚Éór0,‚Éór0) = 0. The scalar
self-energy in this region is given only by the core-induced part:
ERen =

(107)
being Àúr0 = r0 + (Œ± ‚àí1)a. Near the core‚Äôs center, Àúr0 ‚âà0,

(108)

so the main contribution into the self-energy comes from the lowest mode, l = 0,
resulting in
ERen ‚âàq2mD(‚àí)
0
(a)
4œÄ2
.
(109)
Taking the expression for the coeÔ¨Écient D(‚àí)
l
(a), for l = 0, and considering Œæ = 0,
after some steps we Ô¨Ånd
D(‚àí)
0
(a) = 1

œÄe‚àímŒ±a(Œ± ‚àí1)
sinh(mŒ±a)(Œ± + Œ±am ‚àí1) + Œ±am cosh(mŒ±a) .
(110)
Finally substituting the above expression into (109), and taking the limit m ‚Üí0 we
obtain
ERen(r) ‚âàq2(Œ± ‚àí1)
8œÄŒ±2a
.
(111)
Also we can calculate the core-induced contribution on the scalar self-energy near
the boundary. Again, adopting a similar procedure as in the previous corresponding
analysis, we can verify after some intermediate steps that the leading term inside
the summation in (107) behaves as,
1
4l
(1 ‚àíŒ±)(8Œæ ‚àí1)
Œ±a
¬µ Àúr
Œ±a

(112)
Finally, taking this expression back into (107) we obtain,
ERen ‚âàq2 (1 ‚àíŒ±)(1 ‚àí8Œæ)
32œÄŒ±a

(113)
Once more we can see that this divergent contribution vanishes for Œæ = 1/8.
Before to Ô¨Ånish this application we want to cal attention that (105) and (113),
for Œæ = 0, coincide, up the numerical factor 4œÄ, with the corresponding core-induced
electrostatic self-energies derived in [13].
4. Concluding remarks
In this paper we have analyzed induced self-energies associated with particle with
electric and scalar charges place at rest in the global monopole spacetime, consid-
ering a inner structure to it. These two distinct situations have been investigated
separately along this paper.
As we could see, both investigations depend on the corresponding three-dimensiona
Green functions. For the general spherically symmetric static model of the core with
Ô¨Ånite thickness we have constructed the corresponding Green functions in both exte-
rior and interior regions. In the region outside the core these functions are presented
as a sum of two distinct contributions. The Ô¨Årsts ones corresponds to the Green
functions for the geometry of a point-like global monopole and the seconds ones are
73

induced by the non-trivial structure of the monopole core. A similar structure is
also presented by the Green functions for the region inside the monopole.
The self-energies are formally expressed in terms of the evaluation of the re-
spective Green functions in the coincidence limit; however, because the results are
divergent, we had to apply some renormalization procedure in order to obtain Ô¨Ånite
and well deÔ¨Åned values. Here we used the point-splitting procedure. We analyze the
divergent contributions associated with the Green functions at the coincidence limit,
and extract all of them. In fact we did this in a manifest form by subtracting from
the Green functions the DeWit-Schwinger adiabatic expansions which are divergent
in the coincidence limit.
As an application of the general results, in section 3 we have considered a simple
core model with a Ô¨Çat spacetime, the so called Ô¨Çower-pot model.
For the electrostatic case, the corresponding self-forces are repulsive with respect
to the core boundary in the case Œ± < 1 and attractive for Œ± > 1. In particular, for
the Ô¨Årst case, the charge placed at the core center is in a stable equilibrium position.
Although in the Ô¨Çower-pot model, we have found a Ô¨Ånite value of the self-energy
at the monopole‚Äôs center, it presents a logarithmic singular behavior at the core
boundary.
As to the scalar charged particle the main conclusions found in this work, three
deserves to be mentioned.
They are:
i) The renormalized self-energy depends
strongly on the value adopted for the curvature coupling constant Œæ.
For spe-
ciÔ¨Åc values of this constant, the self-energy may provide repulsive, or attractive
self-forces with respect to the boundary. ii) The self-energy presents a Ô¨Ånite value
at the monopole‚Äôs core center, and iii) for confomally coupled massless Ô¨Åeld, the
self-energy only depends on the core-iduced part.

Quantum vacuum in de Sitter spacetime

Abstract
Local properties of the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are investigated for a
massive scalar Ô¨Åeld with general curvature coupling parameter in background
of D+1-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. The inÔ¨Çuence of the non-trivial topol-
ogy of spatial dimensions and of the presence of boundaries on these properties
are studied. Both the topological and boundary-induced parts in the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor are time-dependent and they violate the local de Sit-
ter symmetry.
1. Introduction
De Sitter (dS) spacetime is one of the simplest and most interesting spacetimes
allowed by general relativity. Quantum Ô¨Åeld theory in this background has been
extensively studied during the past two decades. Much of early interest to dS space-
time was motivated by the questions related to the quantization of Ô¨Åelds propagating
on curved backgrounds (for a review see [1]). This spacetime has a high degree of
symmetry and numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background.
The importance of this theoretical work increased by the appearance of the inÔ¨Ça-
tionary cosmology scenario [2]. In most inÔ¨Çationary models an approximately dS
spacetime is employed to solve a number of problems in standard cosmology. During
an inÔ¨Çationary epoch quantum Ô¨Çuctuations in the inÔ¨Çaton Ô¨Åeld introduce inhomo-
geneities and may aÔ¨Äect the transition toward the true vacuum. These Ô¨Çuctuations
play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inÔ¨Çation. More re-
cently astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae, galaxy clusters and
cosmic microwave background [3] indicate that at the present epoch the Universe
is accelerating and can be well approximated by a world with a positive cosmologi-
cal constant. If the Universe would accelerate indeÔ¨Ånitely, the standard cosmology
would lead to an asymptotic dS universe. Hence, the investigation of physical ef-
fects in dS spacetime is important for understanding both the early Universe and
its future. In addition to the above, an interesting topic which has received increas-
ing attention is related to string-theoretical models of dS spacetime and inÔ¨Çation.
Recently a number of constructions of metastable dS vacua within the framework
of string theory are discussed (see, for instance, [4, 5] and references therein).
76

In the present paper we discuss the quantization of a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld with
general curvature coupling parameter on background of dS spacetime. A common
problem in formulating quantum Ô¨Åeld theory on a curved background is ambiguity
in the choice of vacuum. In de Sitter space there is a one-parameter family of vacua
invariant under the de Sitter group, which have been dubbed the Œ± vacua [6]. It has
long been suggested that the only physically sensible vacuum is the Bunch-Davies
(Euclidean) vacuum. One reason for this choice is that the free propagators in the
Bunch-Davies exhibit a Hadamard singularity, which matches with what is expected
in the Ô¨Çat space limit. We will describe the local properties of the Bunch-Davies
vacuum state. Among the most important quantities describing these properties
are the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the Ô¨Åeld squared and the energy-
momentum tensor. In addition, the VEV of the energy‚Äìmomentum tensor acts as
a source of gravity in the Einstein equations and, hence, plays an important role
in modelling self-consistent dynamics involving the gravitational Ô¨Åeld. The VEV
of the Ô¨Åeld squared for the inÔ¨Çaton Ô¨Åeld is the central quantity in discussing the
generation of inhomogeneities during the inÔ¨Çationary expansion which are sources of
large scale structure in the universe. For a scalar Ô¨Åeld on background of dS spacetime
the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the Ô¨Åeld square and the energy-
momentum tensor are investigated in Refs. [7]-[10] by using various regularization
schemes. The corresponding eÔ¨Äects upon phase transitions in an expanding universe
are discussed in [11]. The non-trivial properties of the vacuum state in quantum Ô¨Åeld
theory are manifested in its response to external inÔ¨Çuences. As simple models of
the latter we consider boundary conditions imposed on the Ô¨Åeld operator due to the
non-trivial topology of the background space or related to the presence of boundaries.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we consider the quantiza-
tion of a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld with general curvature coupling parameter in classical
dS background with trivial topology. dS-invariant vacuum states are discussed. By
using the direct modes summation technique the Wightman function, the renormal-
ized VEVs of the Ô¨Åeld squared and the energy-momentum tensor are evaluated for
the Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The VEV of the energy-momentum tensor for dS
spacetime with toroidally compactiÔ¨Åed spatial dimensions are considered in section
3. The VEV of the energy-momentum tensor and the Casimir forces for the geom-
etry of two parallel plates in dS spacetime are discussed in section 4. The main
results are summarized in section 5.
2. Scalar Ô¨Åeld in dS spacetime
As a background geometry we consider the (D + 1)-dimensional de Sitter space-
time (dSD+1) generated by a positive cosmological constant Œõ.
dSD+1 may be
realized as the hyperboloid
Œ∑¬µŒΩZ¬µZŒΩ = ‚àíŒ±2, ¬µ, ŒΩ = 0, 1, . . . , D + 1,
(1)
77

in (D+2)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with the line element ds2
D+2 = Œ∑¬µŒΩdZ¬µdZŒΩ
with Œ∑¬µŒΩ being the standard Minkowskian metric.
In (1), the parameter Œ± =
p
D(D ‚àí1)/(2Œõ) is called the dS radius. With this embedding the O(D + 1, 1)
symmetry, which is the isometry group of dSD+1, is manifest. DiÔ¨Äerent coordinate
systems can be used on the hyperboloid. In this paper we employ the, so called,
planar or inÔ¨Çationary coordinates, (t, z1, . . . , zD), which are most appropriate for
cosmological applications. These coordinates are related to the coordinates Z¬µ by
the expressions
Z0

(2)
They cover the half of hyperboloid (1) with Z0 + ZD+1 > 0.
In planar coordinates the dS line element takes the form
ds2 = dt2 ‚àíe2t/Œ±
D
X
l=1
(dzl)2.
(3)
In what follows, in addition to the synchronous time coordinate, t, we will also use
the conformal time, œÑ, deÔ¨Åned as œÑ = ‚àíŒ±e‚àít/Œ±, ‚àí‚àû< œÑ < 0. In terms of this
coordinate the line element takes the conformally Ô¨Çat form:
ds2 = Œ±2œÑ ‚àí2
"
dœÑ 2 ‚àí
D
X
l=1
(dzl)2
#
.
(4)
Note that the line element (4) with 0 < œÑ < ‚àûcovers the remained half of the
hyperboloid (1). First we discuss the case of boundary-free geometry with trivial
spatial topology. In this case we have ‚àí‚àû< zl < ‚àûfor l = 1, 2, . . . D.
We consider a scalar Ô¨Åeld œï(x) with curvature coupling parameter Œæ in back-
ground of dSD+1. The corresponding Ô¨Åeld equation has the form
¬≥
‚àál‚àál + m2 + ŒæR
¬¥
œï = 0,
(5)
where ‚àál is the covariant derivative operator and R = D(D + 1)/Œ±2 is the Ricci
scalar for the background spacetime. The most important special cases correspond to
minimally and conformally coupled scalar Ô¨Åelds with Œæ = 0 and Œæ = ŒæD ‚â°(D‚àí1)/4D,
respectively.
The quantization of the Ô¨Åeld œï(x) in dS spacetime is done by the standard
methods of quantum Ô¨Åeld theory on curved backgrounds (for a review see [1]). Let
78

{œïœÉ(x), œï‚àó
œÉ(x)} be a complete set of solutions to the Ô¨Åeld equation (5) speciÔ¨Åed by
a collective index œÉ and normalized by the condition
Z
Œ£
dŒ£¬µ[œïœÉ(x)‚àÇ¬µœï‚àó
œÉ‚Ä≤(x) ‚àíœï‚àó
œÉ‚Ä≤(x)‚àÇ¬µœïœÉ(x)] = iŒ¥œÉœÉ‚Ä≤.
(6)
where Œ£ is a spacelike slice. Here and in what follows, Œ¥œÉœÉ‚Ä≤ is understood as Dirac
delta-function for continuous components of the collective index œÉ and as Kronecker
delta for discrete ones. We expand the Ô¨Åeld operator in terms of the mode functions
as
œï(x) =
X
œÉ
[aœÉœïœÉ(x) + a+
œÉ œï‚àó
œÉ(x)],
(7)
where aœÉ and a+
œÉ are the annihilation and creation operators with the standard
commutation relations [aœÉ, a+
œÉ‚Ä≤] = Œ¥œÉœÉ‚Ä≤, [aœÉ, aœÉ‚Ä≤] = [a+
œÉ , a+
œÉ‚Ä≤] = 0.
For continuous
components of the collective index œÉ the summation in (7) is understood as an
integration with an appropriate measure. Further, we deÔ¨Åne the vacuum state as
follows: aœÉ |0‚ü©= 0. The multiparticle Fock states are constructed in the standard
way acting by the creation operators on the vacuum state. In particular, a one-
particle state is deÔ¨Åned as |1œÉ‚ü©= a+
œÉ |0‚ü©.
Note that, in general, the notion of the vacuum state depends on the choice of
the mode functions. If { ¬ØœïœÅ(x), ¬Øœï‚àó
œÅ(x)} is another set of mode functions with the
corresponding vacuum state |¬Ø0‚ü©, then this state contains P
œÅ |Œ≤œÅœÉ|2 particles in the
œïœÉ(x) mode, where Œ≤œÅœÉ = ‚àí( ¬ØœïœÅ(x), œï‚àó
œÉ(x)) is the Bogoliubov coeÔ¨Écients. The two
vacuum states, |¬Ø0‚ü©and |0‚ü©, coincide only in the case Œ≤œÅœÉ = 0.
In dS spacetime described by the inÔ¨Çationary coordinates, Eq. (3), the spatial
coordinate dependence of the mode functions can be taken in the form eik¬∑z with
z = (z1, . . . , zD) and k = (k1, . . . , kD). For dS spactime with trivial topology one has
‚àí‚àû< kl < +‚àûand the collective index is speciÔ¨Åed as œÉ = (k1, . . . , kD). From (5)
we get the equation for the time-dependent part of the mode functions. The latter
is solved in terms of the cylindrical functions and the mode functions are presented
as
œïœÉ(x) = Œ∑D/2 X
j=1,2
cjH(j)
ŒΩ (kŒ∑)eik¬∑z, Œ∑ = |œÑ|,
(8)
where k = |k|, H(j)
ŒΩ (z), j = 1, 2, are the Hankel functions with the order
ŒΩ =
¬£
D2/4 ‚àíD(D + 1)Œæ ‚àím2Œ±2¬§1/2 .
(9)
Note that the latter can be either real or imaginary in dependence of the curvature
coupling parameter and the mass. From the normalization condition (6) we obtain
the following relation between the coeÔ¨Écients cj:
|c1|2 ‚àíei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ|c2|2 = ei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2
8(2œÄŒ±)D‚àí1 .
(10)
DiÔ¨Äerent choices of one of the coeÔ¨Écients cj correspond to diÔ¨Äerent choices of the
vacuum state in dS spacetime. The choice of the vacuum state is among the most
79

important steps in construction of a quantum Ô¨Åeld theory in a Ô¨Åxed classical gravi-
tational background. dS spacetime is a maximally symmetric space and it is natural
to choose a vacuum state having the same symmetry. In fact, there exists a one-
parameter family of maximally symmetric quantum states [6] which are called Œ±
vacua. In inÔ¨Çationary coordinates these states are realized by the mode functions
(8) with the coeÔ¨Écients cj being independent of k.
In the discussion below we
will assume that the Ô¨Åeld is prepared in the dS-invariant Bunch-Davies vacuum
state (otherwise known as the Euclidean vacuum) [10] for which c2 = 0. As we
have already mentioned before, among the set of dS-invariant quantum states the
Bunch-Davies vacuum is the only one for which the short distance singularities of
the two-point functions are of the Hadamard form. For a general Œ± vacuum, the
subtractions in the renormalization procedure include nonlocal contributions to the
eÔ¨Äective action. In [12] it is shown that, except for the Bunch-Davies vacuum, Œ±
vacua states are unphysical when gravitational interactions are included. This ob-
servation is applied to the quantum state of the inÔ¨Çaton, and it is found that strong
Ô¨Åne tuning is required for states other than the Bunch-Davies vacuum to lead to
observable features in the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy. In
[13] it is proved that for an arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic physical initial
state in de Sitter spacetime he expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor
for a scalar Ô¨Åeld approaches the Bunch-Davies value at late times, independently of
the initial state.
Hence, for the mode functions realizing the Bunch-Davies vacuum state one has
œïœÉ(x) = c1Œ∑D/2H(1)
ŒΩ (kŒ∑)eik¬∑z,
(11)
where the constant c1 is directly obtained from (10):
|c1|2 = ei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2
8(2œÄŒ±)D‚àí1 .
(12)
The free Ô¨Åeld theory may be deÔ¨Åned in terms of its two-point functions.
In
particular, the information on the properties of the vacuum state is contained in these
functions. Here we consider the Wightman function, WdS(x, x‚Ä≤) = ‚ü®0|œï(x)œï(x‚Ä≤)|0‚ü©,
where |0‚ü©stands for the Bunch-Davies vacuum state. Our choice of the Wightman
function is related to that, in addition to the VEVs of various physical observables,
this function also determines the response of the Unruh-DeWitt particle detector at
a given state of motion. Having the mode functions, the Wightman function may
be evaluated by making use of the mode sum formula
WdS(x, x‚Ä≤) =
X
œÉ
œïœÉ(x)œï‚àó
œÉ(x‚Ä≤).
(13)
Substituting the mode functions (11) and by taking into account (12), we Ô¨Ånd the
following expression
WdS(x, x‚Ä≤) = ei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2(Œ∑Œ∑‚Ä≤)D
8(2œÄŒ±)D‚àí1

ŒΩ (kŒ∑)[H(1)
ŒΩ (kŒ∑‚Ä≤)]‚àóeik¬∑‚àÜz,
(14)
80

where ‚àÜz = z ‚àíz‚Ä≤. For the further transformation of this expression, Ô¨Årst we use
the formula

Z ‚àû

dk kD‚àí1F(k)JD/2‚àí1(k|‚àÜz|)

(15)
for a given function F(k), where J¬µ(x) is the Bessel function. This yield the formula
WdS(x, x‚Ä≤)

ei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2(Œ∑Œ∑‚Ä≤)D

(16)
As the next step, we write the product of the Hankel functions in terms of the
Macdonald function:
ei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2H(1)
ŒΩ (kŒ∑)[H(1)
ŒΩ (kŒ∑‚Ä≤)]‚àó= 4

In deriving Eq.

The integral in Eq. (20)
is expressed in terms of the associated Legendre function P (1‚àíD)/2
ŒΩ‚àí1/2
(u(x, x‚Ä≤)) (see
Ref. [15]).
Expressing this function through the hypergeometric function, after
some transformations, we get the Ô¨Ånal expression for the Wightman function in
dS spacetime (for two-point functions in boundary-free dS spacetime see Ref. [7]):

Note that, in terms of the coordinates Z¬µ in the higher-dimensional embedding
space for dS spacetime, then one can write u(x, x‚Ä≤) = 1 + [Z(x) ‚àíZ(x‚Ä≤)]2/(2Œ±2).
The property that the Wightman function depends on spacetime points through
[Z(x) ‚àíZ(x‚Ä≤)]2 is related to the maximal symmetry of the Bunch-Davies vacuum
state.
The Wightman function (22) is divergent in the coincidence limit and can not
be directly used for the evaluation of the VEVs of the Ô¨Åeld squared and the energy-
momentum tensor. In order to Ô¨Ånd the renormalized VEVs we can subtract from
the Wightman function the corresponding DeWitt-Schwinger expansion truncated
at the adiabatic order D + 1. After this subtraction the coincidence limit is Ô¨Ånite.
In this way, for the renormalized VEV of the Ô¨Åeld squared in the case D = 3 one

For a conformally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld the coeÔ¨Écient in braces is equal ‚àí1/60. The
energy-momentum tensor (24) is a gravitational source of the cosmological constant
type. Due to the problem symmetry this will be the case for general values D. As a
result, in combination with the initial cosmological constant Œõ, the one-loop eÔ¨Äects

correction to the cosmological constant for a minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld is always
positive, whereas for a conformally coupled scalar it can be also negative.

3. dS spacetime with toroidally compact dimensions
3.1. Mode functions
In recent years much attention has been paid to the possibility that a universe
could have non-trivial topology [16, 17]. Many of high energy theories of funda-
mental physics are formulated in higher dimensional spacetimes and it is commonly
assumed that the extra dimensions are compactiÔ¨Åed. In particular, the idea of com-
pactiÔ¨Åed dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring the-
ories. From an inÔ¨Çationary point of view universes with compact spatial dimensions,
under certain conditions, should be considered a rule rather than an exception [18].
The models of a compact universe with non-trivial topology may play an important
role by providing proper initial conditions for inÔ¨Çation (for physical motivations of
considering compact universes see also [19]).
There has been a large activity to
search for signatures of non-trivial topology by identifying ghost images of galaxies,
clusters or quasars. Recent progress in observations of the cosmic microwave back-
ground provides an alternative way to observe the topology of the universe [17]. If
the scale of periodicity is close to the particle horizon scale then the changed ap-
pearance of the microwave background sky pattern oÔ¨Äers a sensitive probe of the
topology.
The compactiÔ¨Åcation of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quan-
tum Ô¨Åeld theoretical eÔ¨Äects which include instabilities in interacting Ô¨Åeld theories,
topological mass generation, symmetry breaking. In the case of non-trivial topology
83

the boundary conditions imposed on Ô¨Åelds give rise to the modiÔ¨Åcation of the spec-
trum for vacuum Ô¨Çuctuations and, as a result, to the Casimir-type contributions in
the vacuum expectation values of physical observables (for the topological Casimir
eÔ¨Äect and its role in cosmology see [20] and references therein). CompactiÔ¨Åcation of
extra dimensions have moduli parameters which parametrize the size and the shape
of the extra dimensions and the Casimir eÔ¨Äect has been used to stabilize these mod-
uli. The topological Casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed
for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe. The eÔ¨Äects
of the toroidal compactiÔ¨Åcation of spatial dimensions in dS spacetime on the proper-
ties of quantum vacuum for a scalar Ô¨Åeld with general curvature coupling parameter
are investigated in Refs. [21, 22]. The one-loop quantum eÔ¨Äects for a fermionic Ô¨Åeld
on background of dS spacetime are studied in [23, 24].
In this section we consider a general class of compactiÔ¨Åcations of dS spacetime
having the spatial topology Rp √ó (S1)q, p + q = D. This geometry can be used to
describe two types of models. For the Ô¨Årst one p = 3, q ‚©æ1, and which corresponds
to the universe with Kaluza-Klein type extra dimensions. The presence of extra
dimensions generates an additional gravitational source in the cosmological equa-
tions which is of barotropic type (gravitational source with a constant equation of
state parameter) at late stages of the cosmological evolution. For the second model
D = 3 and the results given below describe how the properties of the universe with
dS geometry are changed by one-loop quantum eÔ¨Äects induced by the compactness
of spatial dimensions.
We assume that the spatial coordinate zl, l = p + 1, . . . , D, is compactiÔ¨Åed to S1
of the length Ll: 0 ‚©Ωzl ‚©ΩLl, and for the other coordinates we have ‚àí‚àû< zl < +‚àû,
l = 1, . . . , p. Let zp = (z1, . . . , zp) and zq = (zp+1, . . . , zD) be the position vectors
along the uncompactiÔ¨Åed and compactiÔ¨Åed dimensions respectively. We impose the
following boundary conditions along the compactiÔ¨Åed dimensions
œï(t, zp, zq + Llel) = ¬±œï(t, zp, zq),
(27)
where l = p + 1, . . . , D, upper/lower sign corresponds to untwisted/twisted scalar
Ô¨Åeld, and el is the unit vector along the direction of the coordinate zl.
As before, for the evaluation of the VEVs will use the direct mode-summation
procedure assuming that the Ô¨Åeld is prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state.
The corresponding mode functions have the form

3.2. Vacuum Energy-Momentum Tensor
Having the complete set of eigenfunctions we can evaluate the VEV of the energy-
momentum tensor by using the mode-sum formula
‚ü®Tik‚ü©p,q =
X
œÉ
Tik{œïœÉ(x), œï‚àó
œÉ(x)},
(30)
where the bilinear form Tik{f, g} is determined by the form of the classical energy-
momentum tensor for a scalar Ô¨Åeld. We implicitly assume the presence of a cutoÔ¨Ä
function in (30) which makes the sum Ô¨Ånite. In the problem under consideration
the set of quantum numbers œÉ is speciÔ¨Åed to (kp, nq) with nq = (np+1, . . . , nD).
Substituting the eigenfunctions (28) into mode-sum (30) and applying to the series
over np+1 the Abel-Plana summation formula (see, for example, Refs. [25]), we Ô¨Ånd
the following recurrence relation for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor
‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q = ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p+1,q‚àí1 + ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q.
(31)
Here ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p+1,q‚àí1 is the part corresponding to dS spacetime with p+1 uncompactiÔ¨Åed
and q ‚àí1 toroidally compactiÔ¨Åed dimensions and ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q is induced by the
compactness along the zp+1 - direction. For the corresponding energy density one

As it is seen from the obtained formulae, the topological parts in the VEVs are
time-dependent and, hence, the local dS symmetry is broken by them. By taking
into account the relation between the conformal and synchronous time coordinates,
we see that the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is a function of the combina-
tions Ll/Œ∑ = Llet/Œ±/Œ±, which is the comoving length of the compactiÔ¨Åed dimension
measured in units of the dS curvature scale.
The recurring application of formula (31) allows us to write the VEV in the form
‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q = ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©dS + ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©c, ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©c =
q
X
l=1
‚àÜD‚àíl+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©D‚àíl,l,
(38)
where the part corresponding to uncompactiÔ¨Åed dS spacetime, ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©dS, is explicitly
decomposed. The part ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©c is induced by the compactness of the q-dimensional
subspace. This part is Ô¨Ånite and the renormalization is needed for the uncompactiÔ¨Åed
dS part only. We could expect this result, since the local geometry is not changed
by the toroidal compactiÔ¨Åcation.
For a conformally coupled massless scalar Ô¨Åeld ŒΩ = 1/2 and, by using the formu-
lae for I¬±1/2(x) and K1/2(x), after the integration over x from formulae (32), (34)
we Ô¨Ånd (no summation over i)

(40)

In this case the topological part in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is
traceless and the trace anomaly is contained in the uncompactiÔ¨Åed dS part only.
Formula (39) could be obtained from the corresponding result in (D+1)-dimensional
86

Minkowski spacetime with spatial topology Rp √ó (S1)q, taking into account that
two problems are conformally related: ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q = ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©(M)
p,q /aD+1(Œ∑), where
a(Œ∑) = Œ±/Œ∑ is the scale factor. This relation is valid for any conformally Ô¨Çat bulk.
The similar formula takes place for the total topological part ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©c. Note that, in this
case the expressions for ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q are obtained from the formulae for ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©(M)
p,q
replacing the lengths Ll of the compactiÔ¨Åed dimensions by the comoving lengths
Œ±Ll/Œ∑, l = p, . . . , D.
Now we turn to the investigation of the topological part in the VEV of the
energy-momentum tensor in the asymptotic regions of the ratio Lp+1/Œ∑. For small
values of this ratio, Lp+1/Œ∑ ‚â™1, to the leading order ‚àÜp+1‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©p,q coincides with
the corresponding result for a conformally coupled massless Ô¨Åeld, given by (39).
For Ô¨Åxed value of the ratio Lp+1/Œ±, this limit corresponds to t ‚Üí‚àí‚àûand the
topological part ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©c behaves like exp[‚àí(D + 1)t/Œ±]. By taking into account that
the part ‚ü®T k
i ‚ü©dS is time independent, from here we conclude that in the early stages
of the cosmological expansion the topological part dominates in the VEV of the
energy-momentum tensor. In particular, in this limit the total energy density is
negative.
For small values of the ratio Œ∑/Lp+1, we introduce a new integration variable
y = Lp+1x and expand the integrand by using the formulae for the modiÔ¨Åed Bessel
functions for small arguments. For real values of the parameter ŒΩ we Ô¨Ånd
‚àÜp+1‚ü®T 0

(41)
In particular, this quantity is positive for a minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld and for a
conformally coupled massive scalar Ô¨Åeld. For a conformally coupled massless scalar
the coeÔ¨Écient in (41) vanishes. For the vacuum stresses the second term on the
right of formula (34) is suppressed with respect to the Ô¨Årst term given by (36) by
the factor (Œ∑/Lp+1)2 for i = 1, . . . , p+1, and by the factor (Œ∑ki)2 for i = p+2, . . . , D.
As a result, to the leading order we have the relation (no summation over i)
‚àÜp+1‚ü®T i
i ‚ü©p,q ‚âà(2ŒΩ/D)‚àÜp+1‚ü®T 0
0 ‚ü©p,q, Œ∑/Lp+1 ‚â™1,
(42)
between the energy density and stresses, i = 1, . . . , D. The coeÔ¨Écient in this relation
does not depend on p and, hence, it takes place for the total topological part of the
VEV as well. Hence, in the limit under consideration the topological parts in the
vacuum stresses are isotropic. Note that this limit corresponds to late times in terms
of synchronous time coordinate t, (Œ±/Lp+1)e‚àít/Œ± ‚â™1, and the topological part in
the VEV is suppressed by the factor exp[‚àí(D ‚àí2ŒΩ)t/Œ±]. For a conformally coupled
massless scalar Ô¨Åeld the coeÔ¨Écient of the leading term vanishes and the topological
parts are suppressed by the factor exp[‚àí(D +1)t/Œ±]. As the uncompactiÔ¨Åed dS part
87

is constant, it dominates the topological part at the late stages of the cosmological
evolution.
For small values of the ratio Œ∑/Lp+1 and for purely imaginary ŒΩ, the energy
density behaves like

In the same limit, the main contribution into the vacuum stresses comes from the
term Ap,q in (36) and one has (no summation over i)

(45)
Hence, in the case under consideration at late stages of the cosmological evolution
the topological part is suppressed by the factor exp(‚àíDt/Œ±) and the damping of the
corresponding VEV has an oscillatory nature.

4. Casimir densities in dS spacetime
4.1. Boundary conditions and mode functions
The Casimir eÔ¨Äect is now known to be common to systems of very diÔ¨Äerent kind,
involving Ô¨Çuctuating quantities on which external boundary conditions are imposed.
It can have important implications on all scales, from subnuclear to cosmological.
Imposing boundary conditions on a quantum Ô¨Åeld leads to a modiÔ¨Åcation of the
spectrum of zero-point Ô¨Çuctuations and results in the shifting in the vacuum ex-
pectation values for physical quantities, such as the energy density and stresses.
In particular, the conÔ¨Ånement of quantum Ô¨Çuctuations induces forces that act on
the constraining boundaries. The particular features of the resulting vacuum forces
depend on the nature of the quantum Ô¨Åeld, on the type of the spacetime manifold,
the geometry of the boundaries, and on the speciÔ¨Åc boundary conditions imposed
on the Ô¨Åeld.
An interesting topic in the investigation of the Casimir eÔ¨Äect is its explicit de-
pendence on the geometry of the background spacetime.
As usual, the relevant
information is encoded in the vacuum Ô¨Çuctuations spectrum and, not surprisingly,
analytic solutions can be found for highly symmetric geometries only. The Casimir
eÔ¨Äect on the background of dS spacetime described in planar coordinates was investi-
gated in Refs. [26] for a conformally coupled massless scalar Ô¨Åeld. In this last case the
problem is conformally related to the corresponding problem in Minkowski space-
89

time and the vacuum characteristics are generated from those for the Minkowski
counterpart, just by multiplying with the conformal factor. In particular, for the
geometry of a single plate, the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum
tensor vanishes. The Casimir densities induced by a single and two parallel plates
for a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter has been
considered in [27, 28]. The Casimir eÔ¨Äect for a spherical boundary in dS spacetime
was investigated in [29].
In this section, our main interest are the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor
and the Casimir forces in the geometry of two inÔ¨Ånite, parallel plates located at
zD = aj, j = 1, 2. On the plates the Ô¨Åeld obeys Robin boundary conditions (BCs)
(1 + Œ≤jnl‚àál)œï(x) = 0,
zD = aj,
(48)
with constant coeÔ¨Écients Œ≤j and with nl being the normal to the boundary. For
the region between the plates one has nl = (‚àí1)j‚àí1Œ¥l
D. Dirichlet and Neumann BCs
correspond to special cases Œ≤j = 0 and Œ≤j = ‚àû, respectively. The imposition of BCs
leads to a modiÔ¨Åcation of the VEVs for physical quantities, as compared with those in
the situation without boundaries. Among the most important characteristics of the
vacuum state is the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In addition to describing
the physical structure of the quantum Ô¨Åeld at a given point, the energy-momentum
tensor acts as the source in the Einstein equations and therefore plays an important
role in modelling a self-consistent dynamics involving the gravitational Ô¨Åeld. The
VEV is expressed as the mode-sum (30), where {œïœÉ(x), œï‚àó
œÉ(x)} is a complete set of
solutions to the classical Ô¨Åeld equation satisfying the boundary conditions (48).
In the region between the plates, a1 < zD < a2, the eigenfunctions realizing the
Bunch-Davies vacuum state and satisfying the BC on the plate at zD = a1, have
the form
œïœÉ(x) = CœÉŒ∑D/2H(1)
ŒΩ (Œ∑K) cos[kD(zD ‚àía1) + Œ±1(kD)]eik¬∑z,
(49)
with the notations K =
q
k2 + k2
D and e2iŒ±1(x) = (iŒ≤1x‚àí1)/(iŒ≤1x+1). In Eq. (49),
z = (z1, . . . , zD‚àí1) is the position vector along the dimensions parallel to the plates
and k = (k1, . . . , kD‚àí1). For a conformally coupled massless Ô¨Åeld one has ŒΩ = 1/2.
From the boundary condition on the plate zD = a2 it follows that the eigenvalues
for kD are solutions of the equation
(1 ‚àíb1b2y2) sin y ‚àí(b1 + b2)y cos y = 0, y = kDa,
(50)
where bj = Œ≤j/a and a = a2 ‚àía1. In the discussion below we will assume that all
zeros are real. In particular, this is the case for the conditions bj ‚©Ω0 (see Ref. [30]).
The positive solutions of Eq. (50) will be denoted by y = Œªn, n = 1, 2, . . ., and
for the eigenvalues of kD one has kD = Œªn/a. Consequently, the eigenfunctions are
speciÔ¨Åed by the set œÉ = (k, n). The coeÔ¨Écient CœÉ in (49) is determined from the
normalization condition and is given by the expression
C2
œÉ =
(2œÄ)2‚àíDŒ±1‚àíDei(ŒΩ‚àíŒΩ‚àó)œÄ/2

the star meaning complex conjugate.
It is well known that in dS spacetime without boundaries the Bunch‚ÄìDavies vac-
uum state is not a physically realizable state for Re ŒΩ ‚©æD/2. The corresponding
two-point functions contain infrared divergences. In the presence of boundaries, the
BCs on the quantized Ô¨Åeld may exclude long wavelength modes and the Bunch-
Davies vacuum becomes a realizable state. An example of this type of situation is
provided by the geometry of two parallel plates described above. In the region be-
tween the plates and for BCs with Œ≤j ‚©Ω0, Œ≤j Ã∏= ‚àû, there is a maximum wavelength,
2œÄa/Œª1, and the two-point functions contain no infrared divergences. Mathemat-
ically, this situation corresponds to the one where in the argument of the Hankel
function we have K ‚©æŒª1/a.
4.2. VEV of the energy-momentum tensor
Combining Eqs. (30),(28),(51), for the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor
in the region between the plates we Ô¨Ånd the expression which contains series over
Œªn.
For the summation of this series we apply the Abel-Plana type summation
formula from Refs. [30, 25]. This allows us to write the diagonal components in the
decomposed form (no summation over l)

is the VEV for the geometry of a single plate at zD = aj when the second plate is ab-
sent [27] and ‚ü®T l
l ‚ü©dS is the corresponding renormalized VEV in dS spacetime without
boundaries discussed in section 2. For points away from the plates, renormalization
is required for the latter part only. The last term on the right hand side of Eq. (52)
is induced by the presence of the second plate. Note that in the formulas given
above, |zD ‚àíaj|/Œ∑ is the proper distance of the observation point from the plate at
zD = aj, measured in units of the dS curvature radius Œ±. The VEVs depend on time
through the combinations |zD ‚àíaj|/Œ∑ and Œ≤j/Œ∑. This property is a consequence of
the maximal symmetry of dS spacetime and of Bunch‚ÄìDavies vacuum.

In these formulas we have deÔ¨Åned the function

(59)
The oÔ¨Ä-diagonal component (57) corresponds to the energy Ô¨Çux along the direction
perpendicular to the plates.
Depending on the values of the coeÔ¨Écients in the
boundary conditions and of the Ô¨Åeld mass this Ô¨Çux can be positive or negative. In the
case when Œ≤1 = Œ≤2, the oÔ¨Ä-diagonal component ‚ü®T D
0 ‚ü©vanishes at zD = (a1 + a2)/2.
This property is a direct consequence of the problem symmetry.
For a conformally coupled massless scalar Ô¨Åeld (Œæ = ŒæD, m = 0) the single
plate part in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor vanishes and one Ô¨Ånds (no

where Bl = 1 for
l = 0, . . . , D ‚àí1 and BD = ‚àíD. The boundary induced part
in this formula could have been obtained from the corresponding result for the
Casimir eÔ¨Äect in Minkowski spacetime, by using the fact that the two problems are
conformally related. Note that the boundary induced part in Eq. (60) is traceless
and the trace anomaly is contained in the boundary-free part only.
In the region zD < a1 (zD > a2) the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor
coincides with the corresponding VEV for a single plate located at zD = a1 (zD = a2)
92

and is given by the expressions (56) and (58), with j = 1 (j = 2). The results
obtained in the present paper can be applied to a more general problem where the
cosmological constant is diÔ¨Äerent in separate regions zD < a1, a1 < zD < a2, and
zD > a2. In this case the plate can be considered as a simple model of a thin domain
wall separating the regions with diÔ¨Äerent dS vacua.
4.3. Casimir Forces
Having the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, we can evaluate the forces
acting on the plates.
The vacuum force acting per unit surface of the plate at
zD = aj is determined by the D
D-component of the vacuum energy-momentum tensor
evaluated at this point. For the region between the plates, the corresponding eÔ¨Äective
pressures can be written as p(j) = p(j)
1
+ p(j)
(int), j = 1, 2.
The term p(j)
1
is the
pressure for a single plate at zD = aj, when the second plate is absent.
This
term is divergent due to the surface divergences in the subtracted VEVs and needs
additional renormalization. The term p(j)
(int) is the pressure induced by the second
plate, and can be termed as an interaction force. This contribution is Ô¨Ånite for all
nonzero distances between the plates. In the regions zD < a1 and zD > a2 we have
p(j) = p(j)
1 . As a result, the contributions to the vacuum force coming from the term
p(j)
1
are the same from the left and from the right sides of the plate, so that there is
no net contribution to the eÔ¨Äective force.
The interaction force on the plate at zD = aj is obtained from the last term on
the right hand side of Eq. (52) for ‚ü®T D
D ‚ü©(with minus sign) taking zD = aj:

(61)
where H(x, y) is deÔ¨Åned by Eq. (53). The time dependence of the forces appears in
the form a/Œ∑ and Œ≤j/Œ∑. Note that the ratio a/Œ∑ is the proper distance between the
plates measured in units of dS curvature radius Œ±. The eÔ¨Äective pressures (61) can be
either positive or negative, leading to repulsive or to attractive forces, respectively.
For Œ≤1 Ã∏= Œ≤2 the Casimir forces acting on the left and on the right plates are diÔ¨Äerent.
For large values of Œ±, to leading order, the corresponding result for the geometry of
two parallel plates in Minkowski spacetime is obtained:

Note that in the Minkowski spacetime the force is the same for both plates with
independence of the values for the coeÔ¨Écients Œ≤j and this force does not depend on
the curvature coupling parameter.

(int) is
positive which corresponds to an attractive force for all separations.
Now we turn to the investigation of the asymptotic behavior for the vacuum
forces in the general case of Robin BC. In the limit of small proper distances between
the plates, a/Œ∑ ‚â™1, to leading order we Ô¨Ånd

,
(66)
and the corresponding force is attractive. In (66), Œ∂R(x) is the Riemann zeta func-
tion. The same result is obtained for Dirichlet BCs on both plates. In the case of
Dirichlet BC on one plate and non-Dirichlet one on the other, the leading term is
obtained from Eq. (66) with an additional factor (2‚àíD ‚àí1). In this case the vacuum
force is repulsive at small distances.
In considering the large distance asymptotics, corresponding to a/Œ∑ ‚â´1, the
cases of real and imaginary ŒΩ must be studied separately. For positive values of ŒΩ,
one has

with fD = ‚àí2ŒΩ [Œæ + (Œæ ‚àí1/4) (D ‚àí2ŒΩ)] and Œ¥j = cj(0).
Note that Œ¥j = ‚àí1 for
non-Neumann BC, while Œ¥j = 1 if the BC is Neumann. In the case of non-Neumann
BCs we have assumed that |Œ≤j|/a ‚â™1.
As it is seen from (68), for positive values of ŒΩ and when fD Ã∏= 0, at large
distances the ratio of the Casimir forces acting on the plate with Neumann and non-
Neumann BCs is of the order (a/Œ∑)2. Note that in neither of these cases does the
force depend on the speciÔ¨Åc value of Robin coeÔ¨Écient in the BC on the second plate.
For Dirichlet BC on the plate at zD = aj (Œ≤j = 0), at large separations the Casimir
force acting on that plate is repulsive (attractive) for Neumann (non-Neumann) BCs
on the other plate. The nature of the force acting on the plate with Neumann BC
depends on the sign of fD and can be either repulsive or attractive, in function of the
curvature coupling parameter and of the Ô¨Åeld mass. For minimally and conformally
coupled massive scalar Ô¨Åelds one has fD = ŒΩ(D/2 ‚àíŒΩ) and fD = ŒΩ(1/2 ‚àíŒΩ)/D,
respectively, and this parameter is positive. The corresponding force is attractive
(repulsive) for Neumann (non-Neumann) BC on the second plate. Note that for
the geometry of parallel plates in the Minkowski bulk the Casimir forces at large
distances are repulsive for Neumann BC on one plate and for non-Neumann BC on
the other plate. For all other cases of BCs the forces are attractive.
For imaginary ŒΩ, the leading order terms at large separations between the plates
are in the form

(int)

4Œ±‚àíD‚àí1|g(j)

(j). In this case the decay of the vacuum forces is oscillatory.
In Fig. 3, we have plotted the Casimir force for a D = 3 scalar Ô¨Åeld with Dirichlet
BC, minimally coupled to gravity, as a function of the proper distance between the
plates, measured in units of the dS curvature scale Œ±. The Ô¨Ågures near the curves
correspond to the values of the parameter mŒ±. Values are taken in a way so to have
both possibilities, with positive and purely imaginary values of the parameter ŒΩ.
In Fig. 4 the dependence of the Casimir force on the parameter mŒ± is depicted
for a given separation corresponding to a/Œ∑ = 4. Conformally coupled scalar Ô¨Åelds
with Dirichlet and Neumann BCs are considered. For a massless Ô¨Åeld the force is
the same for Dirichlet and Neumann BCs.
From the discussion given above it follows that for proper distances between
the plates larger than the curvature radius of the dS spacetime, Œ±a/Œ∑ ‚â≥Œ±, the
gravitational Ô¨Åeld essentially changes the behavior of the Casimir forces compared
with the case of the plates in Minkowski spacetime. The forces may become repulsive
at large separations between the plates.
In particular, for real values ŒΩ and for
Neumann BC on both plates, Casimir forces are repulsive at large separations, in
the range of parameters for which fD < 0. Recall that, for the geometry of parallel

plates on the background of Minkowski spacetime, the only case with repulsive
Casimir forces at large distances corresponds to Neumann BC on one plate and non-
Neumann BC on the other. A remarkable feature of the inÔ¨Çuence of the gravitational
Ô¨Åeld is the oscillatory behavior of the Casimir forces at large distances, which appears
in the case of imaginary ŒΩ. In this case, the values of the plate distance yielding zero
Casimir force correspond to equilibrium positions. Among them, the positions with
negative derivative of the force with respect to the distance are locally stable. As it
follows from asymptotic formulas (67), (68), and (70), at large separations between
the plates the decay of the Casimir forces as functions of the distance is power-law
for both cases of massive and massless Ô¨Åelds. Recall that, in Minkowski spacetime
the corresponding Casimir forces decay as 1/aD+1 for a massless Ô¨Åeld and they are
exponentially suppressed by the factor exp(‚àí2ma) for a massive Ô¨Åled.
It is also of interest to compare the features for the Casimir force in dS spacetime
with the behavior of the Casimir forces for parallel plates in AdS spacetime. In
Poincar¬¥e coordinates the corresponding line element is given by the expression
ds2
AdS = e‚àí2ŒªyŒ∑ikdxidxk ‚àídy2,
(71)
where Œ∑ik =diag(1, ‚àí1, . . . , ‚àí1) is the metric tensor for D-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime. For the corresponding Ricci scalar one has R = ‚àíD(D + 1)Œª2 and the
AdS curvature radius is given by 1/Œª. For the general case of Robin BCs on two
parallel plates, located at y = yj, j = 1, 2, the interaction forces between the plates
are investigated in Ref. [31] (see also Refs. [32] for the case where an extra compact
subspace is present). At large distances between the plates, as compared with the
AdS curvature radius, Œª(y2‚àíy1) ‚â´1, the vacuum interaction forces per unit surface,
p(j)
(int), are exponentially suppressed by the factor exp[2ŒΩAdSŒª(y1 ‚àíy2)] for the plate
at y = y1 and by the factor exp[(2ŒΩAdS +D)Œª(y1 ‚àíy2)] for the plate at y = y2, where
ŒΩAdS =
¬£
D2/4 ‚àíD(D + 1)Œæ + m2/Œª2¬§1/2. Note that in AdS spacetime the ground
state becomes unstable for imaginary values of ŒΩAdS.[33] Hence, in AdS spacetime
the Casimir forces are exponentially suppressed for both massive and massless Ô¨Åelds.
5. Conclusion
The natural appearance of dS spacetime in a variety of situations has stimu-
lated considerable interest in the behavior of quantum Ô¨Åelds propagating in this
background. In the present paper we have discussed the properties of the quan-
tum vacuum for a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld with general curvature coupling parameter.
Among the most important local characteristics of the vacuum state are the VEVs
of the Ô¨Åeld squared and the energy-momentum tensor. First we have considered dS
spacetime with trivial topology described in Ô¨Çat coordinates. Unlike to the case of
Minkowski spacetime, where the Poincar¬¥e invariance determines a unique vacuum
state, in dS spacetime the symmetries do not determine the vacuum state completely.
There are a set of vacuum states parametrized by a single complex parameter and
97

known as Œ± vacua. Among them only the Bunch-Davies vacuum state smoothly
patches onto the Poincar¬¥e invariant Minkowski vacuum in the adiabatic limit. In
free Ô¨Åeld theories (interacting only with background gravitational Ô¨Åeld), all proper-
ties of the quantum vacuum are encoded in two-point functions. For the evaluation
of the Wightman function in dS spacetime with trivial topology, in section 2 we
have employed the direct mode summation technique. The mode functions realizing
the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are given by (11) and the Wightman function is
expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function, Eq. (22). Having the Wightman
function, the renormalized VEVs of the Ô¨Åeld squared and the energy-momentum
tensor are found subtracting the corresponding DeWitt-Schwinger expansion trun-
cated at the adiabatic order D + 1 and taking the coincidence limit. Due to the
maximal symmetry of the Bunch-Davies vacuum state these VEVs do not depend
on the spacetime point. In the special case D = 3 they are given by the expressions
(23) and (24).
The eÔ¨Äects of non-trivial spatial topology on properties of the Bunch-Davies
vacuum state were discussed in section 3. We have considered (D + 1)-dimensional
dS spacetime having the spatial topology Rp √ó (S1)q. Both cases of the periodicity
and antiperiodicity conditions along the compactiÔ¨Åed dimensions are discussed. A
recurrence relation is derived which presents the vacuum energy-momentum tensor
for the dSD+1 with topology Rp √ó (S1)q in the form of the sum of the energy-
momentum tensor for the topology Rp+1 √ó (S1)q‚àí1 and the additional part induced
by the compactness of the (p + 1)th spatial dimension. The repeated application
of the recurrence formula allows us to present the VEV of the energy-momentum
tensor as the sum of the uncompactiÔ¨Åed dS and topological parts. Since the toroidal
compactiÔ¨Åcation does not change the local geometry, in this way the renormalization
of the energy-momentum tensor is reduced to that for uncompactifeid dSD+1.
At early stages of the cosmological expansion, corresponding to t ‚Üí‚àí‚àû, the
vacuum energy-momentum tensor coincides with the corresponding quantity for a
conformally coupled massless Ô¨Åeld and the topological part behaves like e‚àí(D+1)t/Œ±.
In this limit the topological part dominates in the VEV. At late stages of the cos-
mological expansion, t ‚Üí+‚àû, the behavior of the topological part depends on the
value of ŒΩ. For real values of this parameter the leading term in the corresponding
asymptotic expansion is given by formula (41) and the vacuum stresses are isotropic.
In this limit the topological part is suppressed by the factor e‚àí(D‚àí2ŒΩ)t/Œ±. In the same
limit and for pure imaginary values of the parameter ŒΩ the asymptotic behavior of
the topological part in the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor is described by
formulae (43), (45) and the topological terms oscillate with the amplitude going to
the zero as e‚àíDt/Œ± for t ‚Üí+‚àû.
In section 4, we have studied the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor and
the Casimir forces for a scalar Ô¨Åeld with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter
satisfying Robin boundary conditions on two parallel plates in dS spacetime. In the
region between the plates, the VEV is decomposed into a boundary-free dS, a single
plate-induced and an interference contributions, respectively. The vacuum energy-
momentum tensor is non-diagonal, with the oÔ¨Ä-diagonal component corresponding
98

to the energy Ô¨Çux along the direction normal to the plates. Depending on the values
of the coeÔ¨Écients in the boundary conditions and of the Ô¨Åeld mass this Ô¨Çux can be
positive or negative. In the case of a conformally coupled massless Ô¨Åeld, the single
plate contribution to the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor vanishes and the
interference part is obtained from the corresponding result for the Minkowski bulk,
by standard conformal transformation.
The vacuum forces acting on the plates are determined by the D
D-component of
the stress. The normal stresses on the plates are presented as sums of single plate
and interaction contributions. The contributions to the vacuum force coming from
the single plate terms are the same from the left and from the right sides of the plate
and thus give no contribution to the eÔ¨Äective force. The interaction forces per unit
surface are determined by formula (61) for general Robin BCs and by Eqs. (63),(64)
in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann BCs. At small distances between the
plates the vacuum forces are attractive, except for the case of Dirichlet BC on one
plate and non-Dirichlet on the other, in which case the force turns out to be repulsive.
At large separations and for positive values of ŒΩ, the force acting on the plate decays
monotonically as 1/(2a/Œ∑)D‚àí2ŒΩ+2, for non-Neumann BCs, and as 1/(2a/Œ∑)D‚àí2ŒΩ, in
the case of Neumann BCs [see Eqs. (68)]. For imaginary values of ŒΩ the behavior of
the vacuum forces is damping oscillatory, in the leading order described by Eqs. (70).
From the analysis carried out above, it follows that the curvature of the background
spacetime decisively inÔ¨Çuences the behavior of the Casimir forces at distances larger
than the curvature scale. As we have seen, in dS spacetime the decay of the forces
at large separations between the plates is power-law. This is quite remarkable and
clearly in contrast with the corresponding features of the same problem in Minkowski
and AdS spacetimes.

Generation of a toroidal magnetic field 
in rotating neutron stars

     The electromagnetic properties of neutron stars (pulsars) are studied. It is 
shown that taking the presence of two angular rotation velocities of the 
components of neutron stars and the first corrections to the general theory of 
relativity into account in the equations of hydrodynamic equilibrium for the 
plasma and in Maxwell‚Äôs equations, toroidal magnetic fields are generated.  
 
 
     1. Introdution 
 
 
     The possibility of field generation in neutron stars was considered in Ref. [1]. It was 
shown there that taking the general theory of relativity into account in the equations of 
hydrodynamic equilibrium for the plasma and in Maxwell‚Äôs equations for the 
electromagnetic fields to the generation of toroidal magnetic fields. The following 
equation was obtained for the time derivative of the magnetic field:

vector in the œï  direction. The equation was obtained for an initial time, when the 
electric current and magnetic field are zero. This result, however, was not correct, for 
the four-dimensional current as [1]

where 
iu  is the four-dimensional velocity. With this definition of the four-dimensional 
current the time derivative of the magnetic field goes to zero and no toroidal magnetic 
field is generated. Note that in Ref. [1] it was also assumed that in the ‚Äúpre-‚Äù phase of a 
neutron star, all three particle species, neutrons, protons, and electrons, are normal. 
102 

However, it is well known [2] that at the temperatures 
8
10
Œ§ ‚â§
 of neutron star cores,  
neutrons and protons are more likely to be superfluid, while the electrons are normal. 
This means that during rotation of a neutron star its nuclear components (the neutrons 
and protons) will rotate with the superfluid angular velocity 
s
‚Ñ¶, while the normal 
component (and, therefore, the electrons, as well) will have an angular velocity
c
‚Ñ¶. In 
general, the super fluid angular velocity 
s

In simple model of a neutron star its central part consists of superfluid neutrons and 
protons and normal electrons. The protons and electrons form an insignificant part, of 
the order of a few percent, of the star‚Äôs core compared to the neutrons. Thus, the bulk 
of the core, the neutrons, forms a superfluid nuclear liquid. This type of core is 
surrounded by a solid shell made up of atomic nuclei and electrons.  The dimensions of 
103 

the core of a neutron star are of the order of 10 km, and those for the shell are an order 
of magnitude smaller. As the neutron star rotates, the shell and the electrons in the core 
rotate as a normal fluid at angular velocity

     Therefore, from Eq. (16) it follows that a toroidal field develops in a slowing-down 
neutron stars and increases with time. The existence of the superfluid rotation of the 
nuclear component of the neutron star and taking the corrections to the Einstein theory 
into account mean that the electric field becomes rotational and depends on z . This, in

Tornado mechanism of astrophysical jets generation, 
acceleration and collimation

1. Introduction 
 
Jet eruptions are a universal phenomenon in the universe. This phenomenon 
encompasses a wide range of astrophysical objects, from active galactic nuclei 
(AGN) to young stellar objects (YSO) within our galaxy. Supersonic outflows with 
less collimation are observed in massive hot stars, such as bright blue variables, as 
well as in low-mass stars, such as protoplanetary clouds (Gonzalez et al., 2004, 
Soker, 2004). These are all observed in the final evolutionary stages of these 
objects. 
Recent extraterrestrial observations of the sun have shown that the solar corona 
is full of jets and flares. Although the total energy of the solar jets and flares is 
much less than in cosmic jets, the spectra and variability of the electromagnetic 
waves emitted from solar jets and flares are similar to those from cosmic flares 
(Shibta and Aoki, 2004) 
Despite the enormous difference in their sizes and powers (AGN jets have 
typical sizes of ~106 pc, with core velocities on the order of the speed of light, and 
source masses of ~ 106-9, while the typical sizes of YSO jets are ~1 pc, with 
node velocities of ~10-3c, and masses of ~ . Most of the outflows are 
morphologically similar and apparently have a common physical origin. There is 
proof of the existence of an accretion disk surrounding the central sources (K√∂nigl, 
1986, Dal Pino, 1995, Bridle, 1998, Reipurth & Bally, 2001). 
Rotation with the velocity on the order of ~10km/s of many jets from YSOs 
has been established (Coffey et al., 2008, 2010, Chrysostomou, 2008). In some 
cases jets "swing" with increasing amplitude from side to side (e.g., HH83 and the 
jets of HH110 (Reipurth, 1989), jet of AGN object 1803+784 (Matveenko et.al, 
2007), rather than appearing as chains of nodes. 
The temperature of the jets from YSOs is slightly greater than ~104 K, and the 
corresponding sound speeds are on the order of ~10 km/s (Bacciotti & Eisl√∂ffel, 
1999). The YSO jets have radii Rj ~31015 cm, average hydrogen density          
~104-5 cm-3 (Morse et al., 1992). Observations yield a somewhat uncertain value for 
122 

the ratio of the densities of the jet and surrounding medium on the order of  j/s ~ 
20 (Perlman et al., 1999). 
The origin of the jets and the mechanisms for their formation are not fully 
understood. Since the erupting matter is partially ionized, the strong collimation of 
jets is associated with magnetic fields (Bisnovatyi-Kogan, Komberg, Fridman, 
1969). The magnetic field determines the direction of the jet and an axial current 
may stabilize the elongated shape of a jet at large distances from its source 
(Bisnovatyi-Kogan, 2004, 2007). 
In this paper a vortical mechanism for the generation, acceleration, and 
collimation of astrophysical jets is proposed on the basis of exact vortical solutions 
of the hydrodynamic equations.  
 
 
2. Equilibrium state of the source 
 
Consider a rotating protostar formation of mass M and polar radius R in an 
incompressible fluid model. The equilibrium state of the rotating gravitating mass 
is determined by Mc‚ÄôLauren spheroid (Chandrasekhar, 1969). The equilibrium of 
an axial cylindrical region with a lower base at depth H from the pole of the 
spheroid (Fig. 1) in a cylindrical coordinate system rotating with angular velocity 
 is described by the equations

3. Development of a no stationary vortex 
 
Let us consider the nonlinear dynamics of vortical perturbations of a protostar. 
At time t = 0 let the selected cylindrical region be subject to a vortical perturbation 
with an azimuthal velocity profile of the form

which describes rigid-body rotation in the region r < r0 of the trunk and a 
differential rotation outside the trunk. The structure given by Eq. (4) is known as a 
Rankine vortex (Rankine, 1870, Meleshko & Konstantinov, 1993, Kundu, 1990, 
Pashitskii, Malnev, Naryshkin, 2007, Abrahamyan, 2008). In writing Eq. (4), we 
have taken into account the fact that the angular velocity of the vortex can vary 
with time, while the time dependence of (t) can be different in different regions of 
the vortex. 
Let us write2 in the Navier-Stokes equation concerning inertial system of frame 
(Landau & Lifshitz, 1986)  
                               P = P0(r,z) + p(r,z,t),  V = r + v, 
 
 
(5) 
                                                
2 Perturbations under consideration do not change the spheroid geometry. The 
change of gravitational potential can be caused by the mass loss. In need we can 
include this, considering mass of a protostar slowly decreasing. Within the 
framework of given approach Eqs. (6) - (9) are exact. 
124 

and including Eqs. (1) and (2), we will receive the equations for an axially 
symmetric flow of viscous incompressible fluid in a coordinate system rotating 
with angular velocity  in the form

Because of the pressure drop, a longitudinal flow of matter develops through 
the lower base of the vortex. We write its velocity in the form

where vz0 and a  can, in general, be functions of time. The parameter 1/ has the 
dimensions of time and characterizes the velocity gradient along the vortex trunk. 
In the following we shall assume a  = const. 
Given Eq. (13), the continuity equation (9) yields

Thus, because of the pressure drop on the axis of the vortex, a suction effect 
creates, the longitudinal flow (13) develops; it creates the converging radial flow of 
matter (14), which, in turn, transports angular momentum and energy from outer 
regions into the region of the vortex trunk. 
Regardless of the functional form of r
v , Eq. (7) with Eq. (4) implies that in the 
region of the trunk (r < r0) the convective and Coriolis accelerations add up, while 
outside the trunk (r > r0) they compensate one another. Given Eqs. (4) and Eq. (14) 
in Eq. (7), we find

that is, because of the transport of angular momentum by the converging radial 
flow (14), the angular velocity of the trunk increases with time, with different rates 
of change of œâ  in the region of the vortex trunk (r < r0) and outside it (r > r0). Eq. 
(15) for the time dependence of the angular velocity of the vortex gives

œâ is the angular velocity of the trunk at the time the vortex is formed. 
Thus, in Eqs. (4), (11), and (12) it is necessary to assume a linear variation in 
the angular velocity e in the outer region of the vortex and an exponential 
variation in in the trunk; this has been done in the formulas given here. 
The velocities (4), (13), and (14) drive the viscous terms in Eqs. (6) - (8) 
identically to zero, while the diagonal components of the viscous stress tensor are 
nonzero. This yields the following power for the dissipation of the kinetic energy 
per unit length of the vortex:

Note that a rapid increase in the angular velocity only occurs in the region of the 
126 

trunk, r<r0, where the angular velocity increases exponentially with time, while the  
angular velocity increases linearly in the outside region r > r0. Thus, at the 
boundary r = r0 there is discontinuity in the rotational velocity which, 
simultaneously with the pressure drop (12) on the vortex axis, increases 
exponentially with time. The increase in the energy dissipation (17) proceeds much 
more slowly. Thus, in this vortical motion the dissipation remains small, in spite of 
a rapid rise in the angular velocity of the vortex trunk.

vortex trunk is

The isobar described by Eqs. (25) and (26) has a funnel shape which becomes 
deeper with time. Here the wide part of the funnel (28), which corresponds to the 
outer region of the vortex, develops slowly owing to the linear dependence of (t). 
In the region of the vortex trunk, on the other hand, the isobar funnel (25) develops 
much more rapidly, and moves into the depth of the protostar in accordance with 
an exponential law (Fig. 1). The bottom of the funnel lies on the axis r = 0 of the 
vortex and its position changes with time as

5. Instability of the tangential velocity discontinuity at the trunk    
    boundary and the saturation of the vortex 
 
Surfaces with a tangential velocity discontinuity are known (Landau & 
Lifshits, 1986) to be unstable to surface perturbations. Let us consider a two-
dimensional flow of an incompressible medium with velocity discontinuities (18) 
and (18a) in the XZ plane (a part of the surface of the trunk with the Z axis parallel 
to the jet axis). 
We shall study a local instability of a tangential velocity distribution; i.e., we 
assume that the dimensions of the segment of the surface being studied are much 
smaller than the corresponding dimensions of the trunk, and that the periods and 
reciprocal growth rates for the perturbations are much shorter than the 
characteristic times for growth of the angular velocity of the vortex. 
In the chosen coordinate system, small perturbations of the surface of 
discontinuity in a coordinate system moving with the cloud are given by

Applying the operator ‚àá to both sides of the first equation, we find, using the 
second equation, that the perturbed pressure obeys a Laplace equation, 
P/ = 0. 
Thus, we write 
                                P/ ~ e-k|y| exp{i(kxx + kzz ‚Äì t)}.  
 
          (34) 
where k is the wave number and  is the frequency of the perturbations, and the Y 
axis is directed along the normal to the surface of discontinuity toward the vortex 
trunk. 
Let (x,z,t) be the displacement, in the Y direction, of the particles in the plane 
of the discontinuity. Then, assuming vx, vy and  ~ exp{i(kxx + kzz ‚Äì t)} we obtain

We now examine the stability in two limiting cases: short and long wavelength 
perturbations. 
Short wavelength - these are perturbations with a wavelength that is much 
shorter than the trunk radius (kr0 >>1) and are typical of perturbations that 
propagate along the azimuth (x - perturbations). Taking kz = 0 for simplicity, from 
Eq. (35) we obtain3 
          ( ‚Äì kV)(  ‚Äì kV+2) +  ( - 2) + i	k2(2  ‚Äì kV) = 0.  
           (36) 
The solution of this dispersion relation is 
      0(k) =Re  = kV/2,   
(k) = Im  = [ (k2V2+	2k4- 4kV)1/2 ‚Äì 	k2]/2.       (37) 
We note first that the expression under the square root in Eq. (37) becomes 
positive for perturbations with wave numbers

and the perturbations with still larger wave numbers grow. The rotation stabilizes 
long wavelength perturbations of the trunk boundary; thus, short wavelength 
perturbations which also lie in our approximation of local instability turn out to be 
unstable. Equation (37) for the growth rate of the perturbations implies that the 
maximum value is reached as k  , i.e. 
                                                     
m = V2/4	.                                                (39) 
Using Eqs. (16) and (37), for the time dependence of the amplitude of the 
surface perturbations in the y = 0 plane, in the initial stage of development of the 
instability over a time interval t <<1/, for a vortex with a power law evolution of 
the instability, we obtain

In an inviscid fluid ( = 0) surface perturbations with a tangential velocity

The maximum growth rate for the perturbations in a layer is known to be 
attained for wavelengths on the order of its thickness l, i.e., with km ~1/l . In the 
case of surface waves, the layer thickness is  2(t), so that km 1/2(t). Using this 
in Eq. (43), we obtain

which implies that (t) varies with time roughly as t2/ ln t. Thus, a turbulent

The turbulent viscosity increases very rapidly with time (~t3) and can reach 
large values (~*). This leads to intense nonlinear dissipation of the growing 
turbulent perturbations in this layer and to a transition into a saturated state. 
The turbulent perturbations saturate when the rise in the kinetic energy of the 
surface waves per unit time owing to instability in the tangential velocity 
discontinuity, 
v2/2, approaches, in order of magnitude, the power of the turbulent 
energy dissipation per unit volume, v3/ (Landau & Lifshits, 1986). In the 
estimates given above, v ~ d|(t)|/dt is the velocity of the turbulent fluctuations,  ~ 
| (t)| is their characteristic scale length, and 
 ~ V/|  | is the maximum growth 
rate for the instabilities. This implies that the velocity of the turbulent fluctuations 
is essentially the same as the discontinuity in the tangential velocity, i.e., v(t)  
V(t). 
On the other hand, the angular acceleration in the rotation of the vortex trunk 
ceases when the discontinuity V(t) in the tangential velocity approaches the sound 
speed cs. The characteristic time ts for this process is given by Eq. (18) (See Eq. 
(53)). 
Thus, Vm  cs

The comparison of Eqs. (50) and (41) shows that the longitudinal long 
wavelength perturbations develop much more slowly than the short wavelength 
perturbations. Thus, saturation of the vortical motion (i.e., termination of the 
exponential growth in the angular velocity of the trunk and in the pressure drop on 
its axis) occurs when the discontinuity in the azimuthal velocity reaches the sound 
speed. 
The time ts for the vortex to saturate is determined from the equation

6. Generation of astrophysical jets by a vortex 
 
The appearance of a Rankine vortex in the surface axial layer of a gravitating 
body, therefore, produces a longitudinal flow of matter (13) and a flow of matter 
which converges toward the vortex trunk (14). These flows provide for an 
exponential growth in the rotational velocity of the trunk and in the pressure drop 
on its axis. The power law increases in the angular rotation velocity and in the 
pressure drop cease and the vortical motion enters a state of saturation when the 
discontinuity in the azimuthal velocity at the surface of the trunk (as we have seen, 
the growth of the long wavelength perturbations proceeds much more slowly) 
reaches the sound speed. This takes place over a time ts (given by Eq. (51)) 
following the appearance of the vortex within which the vortical motion extends to 
ever deeper layers of the cloud, covering a distance given by Eq. (52). On the other 
hand, the longitudinal velocity of the flow along the vortex trunk reaches the value 
given by Eq. (53) during this time, causing mass to flow out through the surface of 
the protostar in the form of a jet with velocity vj (see Eq. (54)). 
As an illustration of the results obtained here, let us consider a spheroidal 
protostar of mass ~ 2 , polar radius 10 a.u., and eccentricity 3/4. For the mass 
density of the protostar we obtain  = 3  (1-e2)/2R0
3 	 10-11g/cm3 and, using Eq. 
134 

(2), we find its angular rotation velocity to be  	 1.810-9s-1 and 0 	 210-9s-1. 
Let a vortex (4) which appears at time t = 0 in the surface polar layer of the 
protostar have a thickness H = 0.2 a.u., trunk radius r0 	 0,5 a.u., and azimuthal 
velocity v0 = 0r0 	 0.3 km/s at its surface. Taking the velocity of the radial flow 
(14) at the surface of the trunk to be vr 	 0.5 km/s, (corresponding to  	 1.310-8s-
1) and the sound speed be cs 	10km/s, with Eq. (51) we find the saturation time for 
the vortex to be ts 	 2.4108s 	 8 years. During this time the low pressure vortical 
funnel spans ever deeper layers of the protostar, forming an essentially stationary 
cylindrical vortex of length 	1.8 a.u. The longitudinal flow velocity at the z = 0 
level turns out to be vz0(ts) 	 19.2 km/s, and at the surface of the protostar, vj 	 20 
km/s, while the parabolic velocity at the protostar's surface is 	12 km/s. The rate of 
loss of mass by the protostar is then 	10-6  /year. 
The jet velocity at the surface of the protostar can also be estimated using 
energy conservation arguments. In fact, equating the total work by the pressure and 
gravitational forces to the kinetic energy of the trunk at the surface of the protostar, 
i.e., taking the Bernoulli integral for the lower and upper bases of the vortex trunk, 
we obtain the same estimate for vj. 
We now estimate the thickness m of the transition turbulent layer. To do this 
we assume that the displacement 0 is on the order of the mean free path for the 
particles, i.e., 0  mH /aH
2 	 104 cm, where mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom 
and aH is its Bohr radius. Then Eq. (44) gives m 	 1.5107 cm. The maximum value 
for the coefficient of turbulent viscosity in the transition layer is then

while the ordinary kinematic viscosity of the gas is much smaller, at  
                                    	 vH/3 ~ 3109 cm2/s,                                                (57) 
where vH is the thermal speed of the atoms and l is their mean free path. Thus, at 
the surface of a vortex trunk of radius r0 rotating at almost the sound speed vm = 
v0exp(
m ts) ~ cs, , turbulence creates a layer of thickness max 2m with an 
anomalously high viscosity 	max >> 	. 
The lifetime of the resulting vortex can be estimated by dividing the kinetic 
energy per unit length of the vortex in its saturated state by the energy dissipated 
per unit length (17):

where the viscosity is expressed in units of 1012 cm2/s. The molecular viscosity 
gives an estimate in Eq. (58) of ~3¬∑109 years, while the turbulent viscosity yields 
~5¬∑106 years for the lifetime of the vortex. Thus, these vortices are substantially 
dissipation-less, even when an anomalously high turbulent viscosity is assumed.

7. Concluding remarks 
 
The vortical mechanism proposed in this paper for the generation of 
astrophysical jets is a unique way of converting gravitational energy of a source 
into the kinetic energy of an erupting jet. This mechanism can also provide for the 
acceleration and collimation of jet flows beyond the confines of a source, both in 
slowing-down regions and in inertial outflows. 
The formation of a turbulent transition layer at the surface of a vortex trunk 
leads to more than the saturation of the vortex. It drives a number of hydrodynamic 
and physicochemical processes which merit detailed study. 
As the vortex trunk emerges from the compact formation, it enters a rarefied 
environment and begins to expand. The following scenario for expansion of the jet 
can be imagined: radial distension of the jet as a whole and expansion of the 
surface layers into the rarefied surrounddings5. Radial distension converts the jet 
from a dense, rapidly rotating state into a less dense, more slowly rotating state 
while conserving its angular momentum. At the same time, matter flows out from 
the jet surface: initially the layers adjacent to the boundary come into motion, and 
ever deeper regions away from the boundary are gradually brought into motion. A 
rarefaction wave develops and propagates radially into the depth of the jet, creating 
a "sheath" of no uniform density with a differential rotation around the jet. This 
leads to the recovery of equilibrium at the boundary of a uniform trunk at some 
radius R of the trunk. After this, the rapid expansion processes cease and a 
quasistationary pattern consisting of two regions is established in the jet: a core 
region that is uniform in density and rotates rigidly and a sheath region with a no 
uniform density, differential rotation, and a converging radial flow of matter. Thus, 
self generation of a vortex from a bare trunk in a jet is possible (Abrahamyan, 
2009). A vortex of this sort will accelerate and simultaneously collimate the core 
region of a jet. The result is a fast, more collimated jet inside a slow jet. "Two-
velocity" CO outflows of this type have been observed in a number of molecular 
jet flows (so-called "molecular bullets"), such as HH211 in IC348 (Gueth & 
Guilloteau, 1999), L1448 (Nisini, et al., 2000, Masson et al.,1990), HH7-11 (Koo, 
1990, Bachiller et al., 1998), and HH111 (Cernicharo & Reipurth, 1999, Hatchell et 
al., 1999). 
 
                                                
5 Here is significant the presences of an accreting disc component round the 
protostar, which can enrich angular momentum of the jet, accelerate and collimate 
it at the long distance from the source.

Abstract
We consider the geometry of second order linear operators acting on the
commutative algebra of densities on a (super)manifold introduced in our pre-
vious work. In the conventional language, operators on the algebra of densities
correspond to operator pencils.
This algebra has a natural invariant scalar
product. We consider self-adjoint operators on the algebra of densities and an-
alyze the corresponding ‚Äúcanonical operator pencils‚Äù passing through a given
operator on densities of a particular weight. There are singular values for the
pencil parameters. This leads to an interesting geometrical picture. In particu-
lar we obtain operators that depend on equivalence classes of connections and
we study a groupoid of connections such that the orbits of this groupoid are
these equivalence classes. Based on this point of view we analyze two exam-
ples: the second order canonical operator on an odd symplectic supermanifold
appearing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry and the Sturm-Liouville operator
on the line related with classical constructions of projective geometry. We also
consider a canonical second order semidensity arising on odd symplectic super-
manifolds, which has some resemblance with mean curvature in Riemannian
geometry.
1. Introduction
Second order linear operators appear in various problems in mathematical physics.
A condition that an operator respects the geometrical structure of a problem under
consideration usually Ô¨Åxes this operator almost uniquely or at least provides a great
deal of information about it. For example the standard Laplacian

‚àÇx2 + ‚àÇ2
‚àÇy2 + ‚àÇ2

in Euclidean space E3 is deÔ¨Åned uniquely (up to a constant) by the condition that
it is invariant with respect to isometries of E3. Consider an arbitrary second order
operator
‚àÜ= 1

¬≥
Sab‚àÇa‚àÇb + T a‚àÇa + R

(1)
acting on functions on manifold M. It deÔ¨Ånes on M symmetric contravariant tensor
Sab (its principal symbol). For example for a Riemannian manifold one can take
a principal symbol Sab = gab, where gab is the metric tensor (with upper indices).
Then one can Ô¨Åx the scalar R = 0 in (1) by the natural condition ‚àÜ1 = 0. What
about the Ô¨Årst order term T a‚àÇa in the operator (1)? One can see that Riemannian
structure Ô¨Åxes this term also. Indeed consider on M a divergence operator
divœÅœÅœÅX =
1
œÅ(x)
‚àÇ
‚àÇxa (œÅ(x)Xa) ,
(2)
where œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)|D(x)| is an arbitrary volume form and choose a volume form œÅœÅœÅ =
œÅœÅœÅg = ‚àödet g|D(x)|. On Riemannian manifold this volume form is deÔ¨Åned uniquely
(up to a constant factor) by covariance condition. Thus we come to second order
operator ‚àÜg such that for an arbitrary function f

We see that Riemannian structure on manifold naturally deÔ¨Ånes a unique (up to a
constant factor) second order operator on functions (the Laplace-Beltrami operator
on Riemannian manifold M).
For this operator the terms with Ô¨Årst derivatives
contain a connection ‚àáon volume forms. This connection is deÔ¨Åned by the condition
that for an arbitrary volume form œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)|D(x)|, ‚àáXœÅœÅœÅ = ‚àÇX

(Here the symbol of connection Œ≥a = ‚àí‚àÇa(œÅg(x)) = ‚àí‚àÇa log ‚àödet g.)
Consider another example: Let Sab(x) be an arbitrary symmetric tensor Ô¨Åeld (not
necessarily non-degenerate) on manifold M equipped with aÔ¨Éne structure with the
connection on vector Ô¨Åelds ‚àá: ‚àáa‚àÇb = Œìc
ab‚àÇc. The aÔ¨Éne structure deÔ¨Ånes the second
order operator Sab‚àáa‚àáb = Sab‚àÇa‚àÇb + . . . . Principal symbol of this operator is the
189

tensor Ô¨Åeld Sab(x). The aÔ¨Éne connection induces a connection ‚àáon volume forms
by the relation Œ≥a = ‚àíŒìb
ab. In the case of a Riemannian manifold the tensor Sab can
be Ô¨Åxed by Riemannian metric, Sab = gab, and the Levi-Civita Theorem provides
a unique symmetric aÔ¨Éne connection which preserves the Riemannian structure.
Thus we arrive again to the Beltrami-Laplace operator (3).
Often it is important to consider diÔ¨Äerential operators on densities of arbitrary
weight Œª. For example a density of weight Œª = 0 is an ordinary function, a volume
form is a density of weight Œª = 1. Wave function in Quantum Mechanics can be
naturally considered as a half-density, i.e. a density of weight Œª = 1/2.
Analysis of diÔ¨Äerential operators on densities of arbitrary weights leads to beau-
tiful geometric constructions. ( See e.g. the works [7, 8, 16] and the book [18].)
For example consider DiÔ¨Ä(M)‚Äìmodules which appear when we study operators on
densities. Namely let DŒª(M) be a space of second order linear operators acting on
densities of weight Œª. This space has a natural structure of DiÔ¨Ä(M)-module. In the
work [8] Duval and Ovsienko classiÔ¨Åed these modules for all values of Œª. In particular
they wrote down explicit expressions for DŒª(M)-isomorphisms œïŒª,¬µ between modules
DŒª(M) and D¬µ(M) for Œª, ¬µ Ã∏= 0, 1
2, 1. These isomorphisms have the following ap-
pearance: If an operator ‚àÜŒª ‚ààDŒª(M) is given in local coordinates by the expression
‚àÜŒª = Aij(x)‚àÇi‚àÇj + Ai(x)‚àÇi + A(x) then its image œïŒª,¬µ(‚àÜŒª) = ‚àÜ¬µ ‚ààD¬µ(M) is given
in the same local coordinates by the expression ‚àÜ¬µ = Bij(x)‚àÇi‚àÇj + Bi(x)‚àÇi + B(x)

At the exceptional cases Œª, ¬µ = 0, 1/2, 1, non-isomorphic modules occur.
In work [15] it was suggested the new approach to consider the commutative
algebra F(M) of densities of all weights on a manifold M. This algebra possesses
a canonical invariant scalar product. One can study diÔ¨Äerential operators on the
algebra F(M). Due to the existence of the canonical scalar product it is possible to
consider the notion of self-adjoint and antiself-adjoint diÔ¨Äerential operators on this
algebra. Operators on the algebra F(M) can be identiÔ¨Åed with pencils of operators
acting between the spaces of densities of various weights. Self-adjoint operators of
second order on F(M) correspond to certain canonical pencils of operators with the
same principal symbol and associated with connection on volume forms on M. This
approach was suggested and developed in [15] for studying and classifying second
order odd operators on odd symplectic manifolds (arising in the Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism) and on odd Poisson manifolds.
The canonical pencils of second order operators have the ‚Äúuniversality‚Äù property:
there is a unique such a pencil passing through an arbitrary second order operator
acting on densities of arbitrary weight except for three singular cases. For example
consider the operator ‚àÜof weight 0 acting on densities of weight Œª, ‚àÜ‚ààDŒª(M),
‚àÜ= Sab‚àÇa‚àÇb +. . . , where Sab is a symmetric contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld. Then for an
arbitrary weight Œª except for the singular cases Œª = 0, 1
2, 1 there exists a canonical
190

pencil of operators which passes through the operator ‚àÜ. These exceptional weights
have deep geometrical and physical meaning. E.g. the failure to construct maps
œïŒª, ¬µ in equation (5) for singular cases is related with existence of non-equivalent
DiÔ¨Ä(M) modules (see for detail [8]).
The space D1/2(M) of operators on half-
densities is drastically diÔ¨Äerent from all other spaces DŒª(M), since for second order
operators on half-densities there is a natural notion of a self-adjoint operator. This
fact is of great importance for the Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry (see [12, 14]).
Applying the approach of the work [15] we study canonical pencils of second
order operators of an arbitrary weight Œ¥ and analyze in detail the exceptional case
when these operators act on densities of weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2 . (An operator has weight
Œ¥ if it maps densities of weight Œª into the densities of weight ¬µ = Œª + Œ¥.) Such
an operator pencil can be deÔ¨Åned by a symmetric contravariant tensor density S =
|D(x)|Œ¥Sab‚àÇa ‚äó‚àÇb (this Ô¨Åeld deÔ¨Ånes the principal symbol) and a connection ‚àáon
volume forms. Specialising the pencil to the exceptional value of weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2
we
come to an operator which depends only on a equivalence class of connections. We
assign to every Ô¨Åeld S the certain groupoid of connections CS. For the exceptional
weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2
the operator with the principal symbol S depends on an orbit of
this groupoid.
This is particularly interesting in the case of odd symplectic structures.
For
symplectic structures (even or odd) there is no distinguished connection. On the
other hand, if a symplectic structure is odd, then the Poisson tensor is symmetric
and it deÔ¨Ånes the principal symbol S of an operator pencil of weight Œ¥ = 0. It turns
out that in spite of the absence of a distinguished connection, there exists a canonical
class of connections on volume forms such that for them Œ≥a (‚àáa = ‚àÇa + Œ≥a) vanishes
in some Darboux coordinates. Connections of this canonical class belong to an orbit
of the groupoid CS and the corresponding operator on half-densities is the canonical
operator introduced in [12]. This operator seems to be the correct clariÔ¨Åcation of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky ‚Äúodd Laplacian‚Äù [3]. (See for detail [14].) This approach may be
used also in the case of Riemannian geometry where S is deÔ¨Åned by a Riemannian
metric. However in this case there exists a distinguished connection (Levi-Civita
connection). We would like to mention article [2] where an interesting attempt to
compare second order operators for even Riemannian and odd symplectic structures
was made.
Another important case is a canonical pencil of operators of weight Œ¥ = 2 on
the line. By considering exceptional weights we come in particular to Schwarzian
derivative.
The plan of the paper is as follows.
In the next section we consider second order operators on the algebra of functions.
We come in this ‚Äúnaive‚Äù approach to preliminary relations between second order
operators and connections on volume forms.
In the third section we consider Ô¨Årst and second order operators on the algebra
F(M) of all densities on a manifold M. First we deÔ¨Åne an invariant canonical scalar
product on the algebra F(M).
This algebra can be interpreted as a subalgebra
of functions on an auxiliary manifold c
M. We consider derivations (which can be
191

identiÔ¨Åed with vector Ô¨Åelds on c
M) and Ô¨Årst order operators on the algebra F(M).
The canonical scalar product on F(M) leads to the canonical divergence of vector
Ô¨Åelds on c
M. We come in particular to the interpretation of Lie derivatives of densities
as divergence-free vector Ô¨Åelds on c
M.
After that we consider second order operators on the algebra F(M). We intro-
duce our main construction: the self-adjoint second order operators on the algebra
F(M), and consider the corresponding operator pencils. These considerations are
due to the paper [15].
In the fourth section we consider operators of weight Œ¥ acting on densities of
exceptional weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2 . For an arbitrary contravariant symmetric tensor density
S of weight Œ¥ we consider groupoid CS. The orbits of the groupoid CS are classes
of connections such that operators with the principal symbol S acting on densities
of the exceptional weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2
depend only on these classes. This groupoid was
Ô¨Årst considered in [14, 15] for the Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry. We also give explicit
description for corresponding Lie algebroids.
Then we consider various examples where these operators occur. We consider
the example of operators of weight Œ¥ = 0 acting on half-densities on a Riemannian
manifold and on an odd symplectic supermanifold, and the example of operators of
weight Œ¥ = 2 acting on densities of weight Œª = ‚àí1
2 on the line. In all these examples
the operators depend on classes of connections on volume forms which vanish in
special coordinates (such as Darboux coordinates for symplectic case and projective
coordinates for the line).
Finally we consider the example of the canonical odd invariant half-density intro-
duced in [13]. We show that this density depends on the class of aÔ¨Éne connections
which vanish in Darboux coordinates.
By diÔ¨Äerential operators throughout this text we mean only linear diÔ¨Äerential
operators.
For standard material from supermathematics see [5], [17] and [20].
2. Second order operators on functions
In what follows M is a smooth manifold or supermanifold.
Let L = T a(x) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa + R(x) be a Ô¨Årst order operator on functions on a manifold
M. Under change of local coordinates xa = xa(xa‚Ä≤) L transforms as follows:
L = T a(x) ‚àÇ

We see that T a(x) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa is a vector Ô¨Åeld and R(x) scalar Ô¨Åeld.
Now return to the second order operator (1) on a manifold M. Under a change

If tensor S = 0 then ‚àÜbecomes Ô¨Årst order operator and T a‚àÇa is a vector Ô¨Åeld.
What about a geometrical meaning of the operator (6) in the case if principal symbol
S Ã∏= 0? To answer this question we introduce a scalar product ‚ü®, ‚ü©in the space of
functions on M and consider the diÔ¨Äerence of two second order operators ‚àÜ+ ‚àí‚àÜ,
where ‚àÜ+ is an operator adjoint to ‚àÜwith respect to the scalar product. A scalar
product ‚ü®, ‚ü©on the space of functions is deÔ¨Åned by the following construction: an
arbitrary volume form œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)|D(x)| on M is chosen and
‚ü®f, g‚ü©œÅœÅœÅ =
Z
M
f(x)g(x)œÅ(x)|D(x)| .
(7)
If x‚Ä≤ are new local coordinates xa = xa (x‚Ä≤) then in new coordinates the volume form
œÅœÅœÅ has appearance œÅ‚Ä≤(x‚Ä≤)D(x‚Ä≤) = œÅ(x)|D(x)|:

i.e.
œÅ‚Ä≤(x‚Ä≤) = œÅ(x(x‚Ä≤)) det
¬µ ‚àÇxa
‚àÇxa‚Ä≤

In what follows we suppose that scalar product is well-deÔ¨Åned: we suppose that M is
compact orientable manifold and the oriented atlas of local coordinates is chosen (all
local coordinates transformations have positive Jacobian:

Now return to the operators ‚àÜand the adjoint operator ‚àÜ+. For operator ‚àÜ
the operator ‚àÜ+ is deÔ¨Åned by relation ‚ü®‚àÜf, g‚ü©œÅœÅœÅ = ‚ü®f, ‚àÜ+g‚ü©œÅœÅœÅ. Integrating by parts
we have

Before proving the claim we give two words about connections on the space of
volume forms.
Connection ‚àáon the space of volume forms deÔ¨Ånes the covariant derivative of volume forms
with respect to vector Ô¨Åelds. It obeys natural linearity properties and Leibnitz rule:
‚Ä¢
‚àáX (œÅœÅœÅ1 + œÅœÅœÅ2) = ‚àáX (œÅœÅœÅ1) + ‚àáX (œÅœÅœÅ2) ,
‚Ä¢ for arbitrary functions f, g
‚àáfX+gY (œÅœÅœÅ) = f‚àáX (œÅœÅœÅ) + g‚àáY (œÅœÅœÅ) ,
‚Ä¢ and the Leibnitz rule:
‚àáX (f(x)œÅœÅœÅ) = ‚àÇXf(x) (œÅœÅœÅ) + f(x)‚àáX (œÅœÅœÅ) ,
(10)
(‚àÇX is the directional derivative of functions along vector Ô¨Åeld X: ‚àÇXf = Xa ‚àÇf
‚àÇxa ).
Denote by ‚àáa covariant derivative with respect to vector Ô¨Åeld
‚àÇ
‚àÇxa . Due to axioms (10)
‚àáa(œÅ(x)|D(x)|) = (‚àÇaœÅ(x) + Œ≥aœÅ(x)) |D(x)|,
where Œ≥a|D(x)| = ‚àáa(|D(x)|) ,

Let Sab be a contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld. One can assign to this tensor Ô¨Åeld an upper connection
i.e. a contravariant derivative
S‚àá
S‚àáa (œÅ|D(x)|) =

Sab‚àÇb + Œ≥a
œÅ|D(x)| .
(12)
Remark 1 Given a contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld Sab(x) an arbitrary connection ‚àá(covariant deriva-
tive) induces the upper connection (contravariant derivative)
S‚àá:
S‚àáa = Sab‚àáb. In the case where
tensor Ô¨Åeld Sab is non-degenerate, the converse implication is true also. A non-degenerate con-
travariant tensor Ô¨Åeld Sab(x) induces one-one correspondence between upper connections and usual
connections. (Compare with the example 5 below where upper connection in general does not deÔ¨Åne
the connection.)
194

Under changing of coordinates a symbol Œ≥a of upper connection (12) transforms in the following
way:
Œ≥a‚Ä≤ = xa‚Ä≤

Œ≥a + Sab‚àÇb log det

(13)
Remark 2 From now on we refer to genuine connections (covariant derivatives) simply as con-
nections. With some abuse of language we identify the connection ‚àáwith its symbol Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ = {Œ≥a}:
Œ≥a = ‚àáa|D(x)|.
Remark 3 It is worth noting that the diÔ¨Äerence of two connections is a covector Ô¨Åeld, the diÔ¨Äerence
of two upper connections is a vector Ô¨Åeld.
In other words the space of all connections (upper
connections) is aÔ¨Éne space associated with linear space of covector (vector) Ô¨Åelds.
Consider two important examples of connections on volume forms.
Example 1 An arbitrary volume form œÅœÅœÅ deÔ¨Ånes a connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ due to the formula (4): Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ : Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ
a =
‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ(x). This is a Ô¨Çat connection: its curvature vanishes: Fab = ‚àÇaŒ≥b ‚àí‚àÇaŒ≥a = 0. (Connection
‚àáconsidered in the formula (4) is a Ô¨Çat connection deÔ¨Åned by the volume form œÅœÅœÅg.)
Example 2 Let ‚àábe aÔ¨Éne connection on vector Ô¨Åelds on manifold M. It deÔ¨Ånes connection on
volume forms ‚àá‚Üí‚àíTr ‚àáwith Œ≥a = ‚àíŒìb
ab where Œìa
bc are ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols of aÔ¨Éne connection.
It is easy to see that connection and upper connection deÔ¨Åne the covariant and respectively
contravariant derivative of the densities of an arbitrary weight: for s = s(x)|D(x)|Œª ‚ààFŒª
‚àáas = (‚àÇas(x) + ŒªŒ≥as(x)) |D(x)|Œª .
Respectively for upper connection
‚àáas =

Sab‚àÇbs(x) + ŒªŒ≥as(x)

|D(x)|Œª .
(14)
Sometimes we will use the concept of connection of the weight Œ¥. This is a linear operation that
transforms densities of weight Œª to the densities of weight ¬µ = Œª + Œ¥: for s = s(x)|D(x)|Œª ‚ààFŒª
‚àáas = (‚àÇas(x) + ŒªŒ≥as(x)) |D(x)|Œª+Œ¥, ‚àáa|D(x)| = Œ≥a|D(x)|Œ¥+1 .
Respectively for upper connection
‚àáas =

Sab‚àÇbs(x) + ŒªŒ≥as(x)

|D(x)|Œª+Œ¥,
‚àáa|D(x)| = Œ≥a|D(x)|Œ¥+1
Proof of the claim (9): Consider a Ô¨Çat connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ : Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ
a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ deÔ¨Åned by
the volume form œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)dx (see Example 1 above). Since the expression
Y =
¬°
‚àÇbSyab ‚àíT a + Sab‚àÇb log œÅ
¬¢
‚àÇa in (8) is a vector Ô¨Åeld (the principal symbol of
the Ô¨Årst order operator ‚àÜ+ ‚àí‚àÜ) and SabŒ≥œÅœÅœÅ
b = ‚àíSab‚àÇb log œÅ is an upper connection
then the sum Y a + SabŒ≥œÅœÅœÅ
b is also upper connection:
SabŒ≥Ô¨Çat

‚àÇbSab ‚àíT a + Sab‚àÇb log œÅ

Thus we have proved the claim.

3. Algebra of densities and second order operators on algebra of
densities
3.1. Algebra of densities F(M). Canonical scalar product
We consider now the space of densities.
As usual we suppose that M is a compact orientable manifold with a chosen
oriented atlas.
We say that s = s(x)|D(x)|Œª is a density of weight Œª if under changing of local
coordinates it is multiplied on the Œª-th power of the Jacobian of the coordinate
transformation:
s = s(x)|D(x)|œÉ = s

(Density of weight Œª = 0 is a usual function, density of weight Œª = 1 is a volume
form.)
Denote by FŒª = FŒª(M) the space of densities of weight Œª on the manifold M.
Denote by F = F(M) the space of all densities on the manifold M.
The space FŒª of densities of the weight Œª is a vector space. It is the module
over the ring of functions on M.
The space F of all densities is an algebra: If
s1 = s1(x)|D(x)|Œª1 ‚ààFŒª1 and s2 = s2(x)|D(x)|Œª2 ‚ààFŒª2 then their product is the
density s1 ¬∑ s2 = s1(x)2(x)DxŒª1+Œª2 ‚ààFŒª1+Œª2.
On the algebra F(M) of all densities on M one can consider the canonical scalar
product ‚ü®, ‚ü©deÔ¨Åned by the following formula: if s1 = s1(x)|D(x)|Œª1 and s2 =
196

(15)
(Compare this scalar product with a volume form depending scalar product ‚ü®, ‚ü©œÅœÅœÅ
on algebra of functions introduced in formula (7).)
The canonical scalar product (15) was considered and intensively used in the
work [15]. BrieÔ¨Çy recall the constructions of this work.
Elements of the algebra F(M) are Ô¨Ånite combinations of densities of diÔ¨Äerent
weights.
It is convenient to use a formal variable t in a place of coordinate volume form
|D(x)|.
An arbitrary density F ‚àãs = s1(x)|D(x)|Œª1 +¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑+sk(x)|D(x)|Œªk can be written
as a function polynomial on a variable t:
s = s(x, t) = s1(x)tŒª1 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ + sk(x)tŒªk .
(16)
E.g. the density s1(x) + s2(x)|D(x)|1/2 + s3(x)|D(x)| can be rewritten as s(x, t) =
s1(x) +
‚àö
ts2(x) + ts3(x). In what follows we often will use this notation.
Remark 4 With some abuse of language we say that a function f(x, t) is a function
polynomial over t if it is a sum of Ô¨Ånite number of monoms of arbitrary real degree
over t, f(x, t) = P
Œª fŒª(x)tŒª, Œª ‚ààR.
What is a global meaning of the variable t? The relation (16) means that an
arbitrary density on M can be identiÔ¨Åed with a polynomial function on the extended
manifold c
M = det(TM)\M which is the frame bundle of determinant bundle of M.
The natural local coordinates on c
M induced by local coordinates xa on M are (xa, t)
where t is a coordinate which is in a place of volume form |D(x)|. Let xa, xa‚Ä≤ be two
local coordinates on M. If (xa, t) and (xa‚Ä≤, t‚Ä≤) are local coordinates on c
M induced
by local coordinates xa and xa‚Ä≤ respectively then
xa‚Ä≤ = xa‚Ä≤(xa) and t‚Ä≤ = det
¬µ‚àÇx‚Ä≤
‚àÇx
¬∂
t .
(17)
If a function is a polynomial with respect to local variable t, then it is a polynomial
with respect to local variable t‚Ä≤ also. (As it was mentioned before we consider only
oriented atlas, i.e. all changing of coordinates have positive determinant.)
It has to be emphasized that algebra F(M) of all densities on M can be identiÔ¨Åed
with an algebra of functions on extended manifold c
M which are polynomial on t.
We do not consider arbitrary functions on t.
197

3.2. Derivations of algebra of densities (=vector Ô¨Åelds on the extended
manifold)
Consider diÔ¨Äerential operators on the algebra F. (We repeat that we consider
only linear operators.)
Let X be a derivation of the algebra F, Then for two arbitrary densities s1, s2
X (s1 ¬∑ s2) = (Xs1) ¬∑ s2 + s1 ¬∑ (Xs2) ,
(Leibnitz rule).
The derivations of the algebra F(M) are vector Ô¨Åelds on the extended manifold c
M,
where coeÔ¨Écients are polynomials over t:
X = Xa(x, t) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa + X0(x, t)bŒª =
X
Œ¥
tŒ¥
¬µ
Xa
(Œ¥)(x) ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa + X0
(Œ¥)(x)bŒª
¬∂
.
(18)
We introduced in this formula the Euler operator
bŒª = t ‚àÇ
‚àÇt
which is globally deÔ¨Åned vector Ô¨Åeld on c
M (see transformation law (17)). Euler
operator bŒª measures a weight Œª of density: bŒª
¬°
s(x)tŒª¬¢
= Œªs(x)tŒª.
There is a natural gradation in the space of vector Ô¨Åelds. The vector Ô¨Åeld
X = tŒ¥ ¬≥
Xa(x)‚àÇa + X0(x)bŒª
¬¥
(19)
is the vector Ô¨Åeld of the weight Œ¥. It transforms a density of weight Œª to the density
of weight Œª + Œ¥.
Remark 5 From now on considering vector Ô¨Åelds on extended manifold c
M we sup-
pose by default that coeÔ¨Écients of these vector Ô¨Åelds are polynomial on t (see equation
(18)).
Our next step is to consider adjoint operators with respect to canonical scalar
product (15) on the algebra F: operator ÀÜL+ is adjoint to the operator L if for
arbitrary densities s1, s2, ‚ü®ÀÜLs1, s2‚ü©= ‚ü®s1, ÀÜL+s2‚ü©. One can see that
x+ = x,
¬µ ‚àÇ
‚àÇx
¬∂+
= ‚àí‚àÇ
‚àÇx, and
bŒª+ = 1 ‚àíbŒª .
Check the last relation. Let s1 be a density of the weight Œª1 and s2 be a density
of the weight Œª2. Then ‚ü®bŒªs1, s2‚ü©= Œª1‚ü®s1, s2‚ü©and ‚ü®s1, bŒª+s2‚ü©= ‚ü®s1, (1 ‚àíbŒª)s2‚ü©=
(1 ‚àíŒª2)‚ü®s1, s2‚ü©. In the case if Œª1 + Œª2 = 1 these scalar products are equal since
Œª1 = 1 ‚àíŒª2. In the case if Œª1 + Œª2 Ã∏= 1 these scalar products both vanish.
198

Example 3 Consider vector Ô¨Åeld on c
M ( derivation of algebra of densities): X
: Xs =
¬≥
Xa(x, t)‚àÇa + X0(x, t)bŒª
¬¥
s(x, t). Then its adjoint operator is:
X+ :
X+s =

¬¥i+
s
= ‚àí‚àÇa (Xa(x, t)s)) + (1 ‚àíÀÜŒª)

X+ = ‚àí‚àÇaXa(x, t) ‚àíXa(x, t)‚àÇa ‚àíX0(x, t)ÀÜŒª +
¬≥
1 ‚àíbŒª
¬¥
X0(x, t) .
DeÔ¨Ånition 1 (Canonical divergence). Divergence of vector Ô¨Åeld X on c
M is deÔ¨Åned
by the formula
div X = ‚àí(X + X+) = ‚àÇaXa +
¬≥
bŒª ‚àí1
¬¥
X0(x, t) .
(20)
In particular for vector Ô¨Åeld X of the weight Œ¥, X = tŒ¥ ¬≥
Xa‚àÇa + X0bŒª
¬¥
(see equa-
tion(19))
div X = tŒ¥ ¬°
‚àÇaXa + (Œ¥ ‚àí1)X0¬¢
.
Divergence of vector Ô¨Åeld on F vanishes iÔ¨Äthis vector Ô¨Åeld is anti-self-adjoint
(with respect to canonical scalar product (15)): X = ‚àíX+ ‚áîdiv X = 0.
Example 4 Divergence-less (=antiself-adjoint) vector Ô¨Åelds of weight Œ¥ = 0 act on
densities as Lie derivatives. Indeed consider vector Ô¨Åeld X = Xa‚àÇa + X0bŒª of the
weight Œ¥ = 0. The condition div X = ‚àÇaXa ‚àíX0 = 0 means that X0 = ‚àÇaXa, i.e.
X = Xa‚àÇa +‚àÇaXabŒª. Hence for every Œª,
X
¬Ø¬Ø
FŒª = Xa‚àÇa +Œª‚àÇaXa. This means that
the action of divergence-free vector Ô¨Åeld X of weight Œ¥ = 0 on an arbitrary density
is the Lie derivative of this density: for s ‚ààFŒª
Xs = (Xa‚àÇa + bŒª‚àÇaXa)s = LXs = (Xa‚àÇas(x) + Œª‚àÇaXas(x)) |D(x)|Œª .
(21)
If X is divergence-free vector Ô¨Åeld on c
M of arbitrary weight then divX = 0 ‚áîX =
tŒ¥ ¬≥
Xa‚àÇa + ‚àÇaXa

s =

¬∂
|D(x)|Œª+Œ¥ .
(22)
One can consider a canonical projection p of vector Ô¨Åelds on c
M ( derivation
of algebra F(M)) on vector densities on M. It is deÔ¨Åned by the formula p(X) =
X
¬Ø¬Ø
F0=C‚àû(M). In coordinates p: X = Xa(x, t)‚àÇa + X0(x, t)bŒª 7‚ÜíXa(x, t)‚àÇa.
We say that vector Ô¨Åeld is vertical if pX = 0, i.e. if X = X0(x, t)bŒª. Divergence
of vertical vector Ô¨Åeld X = X0(x, t)bŒª equals to div X = (bŒª ‚àí1)X0(x, t).
199

Proposition 2 Let Œ† be a projection of vector Ô¨Åelds onto vertical vector Ô¨Åelds such
that div X = div (Œ†X), We have that
Œ†:
X = tŒ¥ ¬≥
Xa‚àÇa + X0bŒª
¬¥
7‚ÜíŒ†X = tŒ¥
¬µ‚àÇaXa
Œ¥ ‚àí1 + X0

bŒª .
Every vector Ô¨Åeld X of weight Œ¥ Ã∏= 1 can be uniquely decomposed as the sum of a
vertical vector Ô¨Åeld and divergence-free vector Ô¨Åeld, generalised Lie derivative (22))
with respect to vector Ô¨Åeld pX:
X = Œ†X + (X ‚àíŒ†X) = Œ†X + LpX .
One can check the statements of this Proposition by straightforward applications
of the formulae above.
What relations exist between the canonical divergence (20) of vector Ô¨Åelds on extended manifold
c
M and a divergence of vector Ô¨Åelds on a manifold M ? Let ‚àábe an arbitrary connection on volume
forms. It assigns to the vector Ô¨Åeld X on M a vector Ô¨Åeld XŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥ on the extended manifold c
M by
the formula XŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥ = Xa 
‚àÇ
‚àÇxa + bŒªŒ≥a

, where Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ = {Œ≥a} is a symbol of connection ‚àáin coordinates x,
(‚àáa|D(x)| = Œ≥a|D(x)|). Connection ‚àádeÔ¨Ånes the divergence of vector Ô¨Åelds on M via the canonical
divergence (20): for every vector Ô¨Åeld X on manifold M:
div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X = div XŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥ =
‚àÇXa
‚àÇxa ‚àíŒ≥aXa

.
(23)
A volume form œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)|D(x)| deÔ¨Ånes Ô¨Çat connection Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ
a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ (see equation (4) and example
1). The formula (23) implies the well-known formula (see also equation (2))) for divergence of vector
Ô¨Åeld on manifold equipped with a volume form
div œÅœÅœÅX = div XŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ =
‚àÇXa

(24)
Considering a connection corresponding to an aÔ¨Éne connection (see Example 2) we come to
div ‚àáX = ‚àáaXa = (‚àÇaXa + XaŒìb
ab).
On Riemannian manifold M Riemannian metric deÔ¨Ånes
connection on volume forms Œ≥a = ‚àí‚àÇa log ‚àödet g (via Levi-Civita connection or via invariant vol-
ume form œÅœÅœÅg). We come to

3.3. Second order operators on the algebra F(M)
We will study now operators of order ‚©Ω2 on the algebra F(M) of densities on
manifold M.
First of all general remark about n-th order operators. 0-th order operator on
the algebra F(M) is just multiplication operator on non-zero density. L is n-th order
operator on the algebra F(M) (n ‚©æ1) if for an arbitrary s ‚ààF(M) the commutator
[L, s] = L ‚ó¶s ‚àís ‚ó¶L is (n ‚àí1)-th order operator.
One can see that if L is an n-th order diÔ¨Äerential operator on F(M), then
L + (‚àí1)nL+ is n-th order operator and L ‚àí(‚àí1)nL+ is an operator of the order
‚©Ωn ‚àí1. We have:
200

Proposition 3 An arbitrary n-th order operator can be canonically decomposed on
the sum of self adjoint and antiself-adjoint operators:
L = 1

+
1
2
¬°
L ‚àí(‚àí1)nL+¬¢

{z

operator of the order ‚©Ωn ‚àí1
.
An operator of the even order n = 2k is a sum of self-adjoint operator of the order 2k
and antiself-adjoint operator of the order ‚©Ω2k ‚àí1, and an operator of the odd order
n = 2k + 1 is a sum of antiself-adjoint operator of the order 2k + 1 and self-adjoint
operator of the order ‚©Ω2k.
Operators of the order 0 are evidently self-adjoint.
Let L = X + B be Ô¨Årst order antiself-adjoint operator, where X is a vector Ô¨Åeld
on c
M and B is a scalar term (density). We have L + L+ = 0 = X + X+ + 2B = 0.
Hence L = X + 1
2div X.
Now study self-adjoint second order operators on F(M). Let ‚àÜbe second order
operator of the weight Œ¥ on algebra F(M) of densities. In local coordinates

(27)
Here for convenience we denote Œ≥a = 2Ba and Œ∏ = C. Studying how coeÔ¨Écients of
the operator change under changing of coordinates we come to
201

Theorem 1 (See [15].) Let ‚àÜbe an arbitrary linear second order self-adjoint op-
erator (‚àÜ+ = ‚àÜ) on the algebra F(M) of densities such that its weight equals Œ¥ and
‚àÜ(1) = 0. Then in local coordinates this operator has the appearance (27). The
coeÔ¨Écients of this operator have the following geometrical meaning
‚Ä¢ S = tŒ¥Sab(x) = Sab(x)|D(x)|Œ¥ is symmetric contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld-density
of the weight Œ¥. Under changing of local coordinates xa‚Ä≤ = xa‚Ä≤(xa) it transforms
in the following way:
Sa‚Ä≤b‚Ä≤ = J‚àíŒ¥xa‚Ä≤
a xb‚Ä≤
b Sab ,
‚Ä¢ Œ≥a is a symbol of upper connection-density of weight Œ¥ (see (13) above). Under
changing of local coordinates xa‚Ä≤ = xa‚Ä≤(xa) it transforms in the following way:
Œ≥a‚Ä≤ = J‚àíŒ¥xa‚Ä≤
a
¬≥
Œ≥a + Sab‚àÇb log J
¬¥
,
‚Ä¢ and Œ∏ transforms in the following way:
Œ∏‚Ä≤ = J‚àíŒ¥ ¬≥
Œ∏ + 2Œ≥a‚àÇa log J + ‚àÇa log J Sab‚àÇb log J
¬¥
Here J = det
¬≥
‚àÇx‚Ä≤
‚àÇx
¬¥
, and xa‚Ä≤
a are short notations for derivatives: xa‚Ä≤
a = ‚àÇaxa‚Ä≤(x) =
‚àÇxa‚Ä≤(x)
‚àÇxa .
The object Œ∏(x)|D(x)|Œ¥ is called Brans-Dicke function 2.
Remark 6 Let ‚àÜbe self-adjoint operator (27) and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ = {Œ≥‚Ä≤
a} be an arbitrary con-
nection on volume forms (‚àá|D(x)| = Œ≥‚Ä≤
a|D(x)|). Then for the upper connection-
density in the equation (27) the diÔ¨Äerence (Œ≥a ‚àíSabŒ≥‚Ä≤
b)|D(x)|Œ¥ is a vector density of
the weight Œ¥. Respectively for Brans-Dicke function Œ∏, the diÔ¨Äerence Œ∏ ‚àíŒ≥‚Ä≤
aSabŒ≥‚Ä≤
b is
a density of the weight Œ¥. (One can easy deduce this recalling the fact that the space
of genuine connections as well as the space of upper connections is an aÔ¨Éne space:
if ‚àáand ‚àá‚Ä≤ are two diÔ¨Äerent connections then their diÔ¨Äerence is (co)vector Ô¨Åeld:
‚àá‚Ä≤ ‚àí‚àá= Œ≥‚Ä≤
a ‚àíŒ≥a = Xa.)
Corollary 1 Given principal symbol S = Sab|D(x)|Œ¥ of the weight Œ¥ and connection
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ on volume forms canonically deÔ¨Åne the second order self-adjoint operator (27)
with upper connection Œ≥a = SabŒ≥b and Brans-Dicke function Œ∏(x) = Œ≥aSabŒ≥b. We
denote this operator ‚àÜ(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥).
The inverse implication is valid in the case if S = Sab|D(x)|Œ¥ is non-degenerate:
Second order self-adjoint operator ‚àÜof weight Œ¥ which obeys normalisation condition
(26) with non-degenerate principal symbol S uniquely deÔ¨Ånes connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ such that
‚àÜ= ‚àÜ(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) + ÀÜŒª(ÀÜŒª + Œ¥ ‚àí1)F, where F is a density of weight Œ¥, and Brans-Dicke
function Œ∏ equals to Œ∏ = Œ≥aŒ≥a + F = Œ≥aSabŒ≥b + F.
2Its transformation is similar to transformation of Brans-Dicke ‚Äùscalar‚Äù, in Kaluza-Klein reduc-
tion of 5- dimensional gravity to gravity+electromagnetism.
202

Consider examples.
First consider the example of operator (27) with degenerate principal symbol
Sab|D(x)|Œ¥.
Example 5 Let X = Xa ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa and Y = Y a ‚àÇ
‚àÇxa be two vector Ô¨Åelds on manifold M.
Recall the operator of Lie derivative (see equation (21) LX = Xa‚àÇa + bŒª‚àÇaXa and
consider the operator
‚àÜ= 1
2 (LXLY + LY LX) = 1
2
¬≥
Xa‚àÇa + bŒª‚àÇaXa¬¥ ¬≥
Y a‚àÇa + bŒª‚àÇaY a¬¥
+ (X ‚ÜîY) .
It is self-adjoint operator since Lie derivatvie is antiself-adjoint operator. Calculat-
ing this operator and comparing it with the expression (27) we come to
Sab = XaY b + Y bXa, Œ≥a =
¬≥
‚àÇbXb¬¥
Y a +
¬≥
‚àÇbY b¬¥
Xa, Œ∏ = (‚àÇaXa)
¬≥
‚àÇbY b¬¥
.
We see that in the general case (if dimension n of manifold is greater than 2) this op-
erator has degenerate principal symbol and upper connection does not deÔ¨Åne uniquely
genuine connection.
3.4. Canonical pencil of operators
Note that an operator L on the algebra F(M) of densities deÔ¨Ånes the pencil {LŒª}
of operators on spaces FŒª: LŒª = L
¬Ø¬Ø
FŒª. The self-adjoint operator ‚àÜon the algebra
of densities (see equation (27)) deÔ¨Ånes the canonical operator pencil {‚àÜŒª}, Œª ‚ààR,
where
‚àÜŒª = ‚àÜ
¬Ø¬Ø
FŒª =
= tŒ¥
2
¬≥
Sab(x)‚àÇa‚àÇb + ‚àÇbSba‚àÇa + (2Œª + Œ¥ ‚àí1) Œ≥a(x)‚àÇa + Œª‚àÇaŒ≥a(x) + Œª (Œª + Œ¥ ‚àí1) Œ∏(x)
¬¥
(28)
It is canonical pencil deÔ¨Åned by symmetric tensor density S = Sab(x)|D(x)|Œ¥, upper
connection Œ≥a and Brans-Dicke function Œ∏(x).
Respectively self-adjoint operator
‚àÜ(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) on the algebra of densities deÔ¨Åned by tensor Ô¨Åeld-density S = Sab(x)|D(x)|Œ¥
and genuine connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ (see Corollary 1) deÔ¨Ånes the operator pencil ‚àÜŒª(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) with
Brans-Dicke function Œ∏(x) = Œ≥aSabŒ≥b.
Operator ‚àÜŒª of the weight Œ¥ maps density of weight Œª to densities of weight
Œª+Œ¥. Its adjoint operator ‚àÜ+
Œª maps density of weight 1‚àíŒ¥ ‚àíŒª to densities of weight
1 ‚àíŒª. The condition ‚àÜ= ‚àÜ+ of self-adjointness of operator ‚àÜis equivalent to the
condition
‚àÜ+
Œª = ‚àÜ1‚àíŒª‚àíŒ¥ .
(29)
Example 6 Let œÅœÅœÅ = œÅ(x)|D(x)| be a volume form on the Riemannian manifold
M. We can consider an operator ‚àÜon functions such that ‚àÜf = div œÅœÅœÅgrad f =
1
2
1
œÅ(x)
‚àÇ
‚àÇxa
¬≥
œÅ(x)gab ‚àÇf(x)
‚àÇxb
¬¥
(see equations (2) and (24) (In the case if œÅœÅœÅ = ‚àödet g|D(x)|
203

this is just the Laplace-Beltrami operator (3).)
Using this operator consider the
pencil
‚àÜŒª = œÅœÅœÅŒª ‚ó¶‚àÜ‚ó¶1
œÅœÅœÅŒª :
¬µ
for s ‚ààFŒª, ‚àÜŒªs = œÅœÅœÅŒªdivœÅœÅœÅ grad
¬µ s
œÅœÅœÅŒª
¬∂¬∂
.
One can see that this pencil corresponds to self-adjoint operator (see relation (29)).
It coincides with the canonical pencil (28) of weight Œ¥ = 0 in the case if principal
symbol is deÔ¨Åned by Riemannian metric Sab = gab, connection is a Ô¨Çat connection
deÔ¨Åned by the volume form (see formula (4) and Example 1): Œ≥a = ‚àígab‚àÇb log œÅ,
and Œ∏ = Œ≥aŒ≥a.
The canonical pencil (28) has many interesting properties (see for detail [15]).
In particular it has the following ‚Äúuniversality‚Äù property:
Corollary 2 Let ‚àÜbe an arbitrary (linear) second order operator of weight Œ¥ acting
on the space FŒª of densities of weight Œª, ‚àÜ: FŒª ‚ÜíF¬µ (¬µ = Œª + Œ¥). In the case
if Œª Ã∏= 0, ¬µ Ã∏= 1 and Œª + ¬µ Ã∏= 1 there exists a unique canonical pencil which passes
through the operator ‚àÜ.
If the operator ‚àÜis given by the expression ‚àÜ= Aab‚àÇa‚àÇb +Aa‚àÇa +A(x) then the
relations

uniquely deÔ¨Åne principal symbol, upper connection and Brans-Dicke Ô¨Åeld. Hence
they uniquely deÔ¨Åne canonical pencil (28).
The ‚Äúuniversality‚Äù property provides a beautiful interpretation of canonical map
œïŒª,¬µ in the relation (5). Indeed due to this Corollary we ‚Äùdraw‚Äù the pencil through
an arbitrary operator ‚àÜŒª = Aij(x)‚àÇi‚àÇj +Ai(x)‚àÇi+A(x) acting on densities of weight
Œª. Then the image of this operator, operator ‚àÜ¬µ = œïŒª,¬µ (‚àÜŒª) is the operator of this
pencil acting on densities of weight ¬µ.
4. Operators depending on a class of connections
In this section we will return to second order diÔ¨Äerential operators on manifold
M. We consider second order operators acting on densities of a specially chosen
given weight.
4.1. Operators of weight Œ¥ acting on densities of weight 1‚àíŒ¥
2
The Corollary 2 states that for a second order operator ‚àÜ: FŒª ‚ÜíF¬µ for all values
of weights except the cases Œª = 0, ¬µ = 1 or Œª + ¬µ = 1 there is a unique canonical
204

pencil (28) which passes through the operator ‚àÜ. Consider now an exceptional case
when operator ‚àÜ: FŒª ‚ÜíF¬µ is such that it has weight Œ¥ and Œª + ¬µ = 1, i.e. it acts
on densities of weight Œª = 1‚àíŒ¥
2
and transforms them to densities of weight ¬µ = 1+Œ¥
2 .
Let ‚àÜsing be such an operator which belongs to the canonical pencil (28):

On the other hand let ‚àÜbe an arbitrary second order diÔ¨Äerential operator of
weight Œ¥ which acts on densities of weight 1‚àíŒ¥
2 , ‚àÜ: F 1‚àíŒ¥
2
‚ÜíF 1+Œ¥

operator with the operator ‚àÜsing . The operator ‚àÜ+ which is adjoint to the operator
‚àÜalso acts from the space F 1‚àíŒ¥
2
into the space F 1+Œ¥
2 , since Œª + ¬µ = 1‚àíŒ¥
2
+ 1+Œ¥
2
= 1
(compare with formula (29)). Hence an operator ‚àÜcan be canonically decomposed
on the sum of second order self-adjoint operator and antiself-adjoint operator of the
order ‚©Ω1. Antiself-adjoint operator is just generalised Lie derivative (22):

Operator ‚àÜsing in formula (30) belongs to canonical pencil, it is self-adjoint operator:
‚àÜ+
sing = ‚àÜsing . DiÔ¨Äerence of two self-adjoint operators of second order with the same
principal symbol is self-adjoint operator of order ‚©Ω1. Hence it is the zeroth order
operator of multiplication on the density. These considerations imply the following
statement:
Corollary 3 Let ‚àÜbe an arbitrary second order operator of weight Œ¥ acting on the
space of densities of weight 1‚àíŒ¥
2 .
Let S = Sab|D(x)|Œ¥ be a principal symbol of the operator ‚àÜ. Let ‚àÜsing be an
operator belonging to an arbitrary canonical pencil (28) with the same weight Œ¥ and
with the same principal symbol S = Sab|D(x)|Œ¥.
Then the diÔ¨Äerence ‚àÜ‚àí‚àÜsing is an operator of order ‚©Ω1. It equals to gen-
eralised Lie derivative (22) with respect to a vector Ô¨Åeld +zeroth order operator of
multiplication on a density:
‚àÜ= ‚àÜsing + LX + F(x)|D(x)|Œ¥ .
In the case if operator ‚àÜis self-adjoint, ‚àÜ+ = ‚àÜ, then Lie derivative vanishes
(X = 0).
It follows from this Corollary that if the operator ‚àÜ: F 1‚àíŒ¥
2
‚ÜíF 1+Œ¥
2
is self-adjoint
operator then it is given in local coordinates by the expression
‚àÜ= 1

come to
4.2. Groupoid of connections
We deÔ¨Åne now a groupoid CS of connections associated with contravariant tensor
Ô¨Åeld-density S = Sab|D(x)|Œ¥ of weight Œ¥.
Consider a space A of all connections on volume forms (covariant derivatives of
volume forms) on manifold M. This is an aÔ¨Éne space associated to the vector space
of covector Ô¨Åelds on M: diÔ¨Äerence of two connections ‚àáand ‚àá‚Ä≤ is covector Ô¨Åeld
(diÔ¨Äerential 1-form):

‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤} such that Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚ààA and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ = Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ + X,
where X, diÔ¨Äerence of connections is a covector Ô¨Åeld. We come to trivial groupoid

Pick an arbitrary contravariant symmetric tensor Ô¨Åeld-density of the weight Œ¥:

deÔ¨Åne the self-adjoint operator ‚àÜ(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) on the algebra of densities. It is the oper-
ator deÔ¨Åned in the equation (27) with principal symbol S, with upper connection
Œ≥a = SabŒ≥b and Brans-Dicke function Œ∏ = Œ≥aŒ≥a (see the Corollary 1). Consider cor-
responding pencil of operators and the operator ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) which belongs to this
pencil and acts on densities of weight 1‚àíŒ¥

Here div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X is the divergence of vector density X on M with respect to connection
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ (see (23)). With some abuse of notation we denote the covector Ô¨Åeld Xadxa and
vector density of the weight Œ¥, Xa|D(x)|Œ¥ = SabXb|D(x)|Œ¥ by the same letter X.
DeÔ¨Ånition 2 Let S = Sab(x)|D(x)|Œ¥ be contravariant symmetric tensor Ô¨Åeld-density
of the weight Œ¥.
The groupoid CS is a subgroupoid of arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ of trivial
groupoid (31) such that the operators ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) and ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) deÔ¨Åned by the
formula (32) coincide:
CS = {Groupoid of arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤such that ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) = ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥)}.
(35)
Using the formula (34) for diÔ¨Äerence of operators ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) and ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥)
rewrite the deÔ¨Ånition (35) of groupoid CS in the following way:
CS = {Groupoid of arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ such that div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X + Œ¥ ‚àí1
2
X2 = 0} .
In other words the arrow Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ belongs to the groupoid CS if two canonical
pencils ‚àÜŒª(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) and ‚àÜŒª(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) intersect at the operator ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥).
We consider the case Œ¥ Ã∏= 1, The case Œ¥ = 1 is trivial 3.
Denote by [Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥] the orbit of a connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ in the groupoid CS
[Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥] = {Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ :
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚ààCS} .
3In this case all the operators ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) do not depend on connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥. Principal symbol
S = Sab|D(x)| deÔ¨Ånes the canonical operator ‚àÜ(S): F0 ‚ÜíF1 such that in local coordinates ‚àÜ(s)f =
‚àÇa
 Sab‚àÇbf

|D(x)|. The groupoid CS is the trivial groupoid of all connections.
207

Proposition 4 An arbitrary contravariant symmetric tensor Ô¨Åeld S = Sab(x)|D(x)|Œ¥
of the weight Œ¥ deÔ¨Ånes the groupoid of connections CS and the family of second order
diÔ¨Äerential operators of the order Œ¥ and acting on densities of the weight 1‚àíŒ¥
2 :
‚àÜ([Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥]) = ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥): F 1‚àíŒ¥
2
‚ÜíF 1+Œ¥
2 .
Operators of this family have the same principal symbol and they depend on equiva-
lence classes of connections which are orbits in the groupoid CS.
Remark 7 Let Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥2 and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥3 be three arbitrary connections. Consider correspond-
ing arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥2, Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥2
Y
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥3 and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1

‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥3. We have that Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥2 + Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥2
Y
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥3 =
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1
X+Y
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥3. This means that for non-linear diÔ¨Äerential equation div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X + Œ¥‚àí1
2 X2 = 0
the following property holds:
(
div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1X + Œ¥‚àí1
2 X2 = 0
div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥2Y + Œ¥‚àí1
2 Y2 = 0
‚áídiv Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥1(X + Y) + Œ¥ ‚àí1
2
(X + Y)2 = 0 .
It follows from (34) the cocycle condition that the sum of left-hand side of Ô¨Årst two
equations is equal to the left hand-sight of the third equation.
Remark 8 Let œÅœÅœÅ be an arbitrary volume form. Using the operator ‚àÜ([Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥]) = ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
one can consider second order operator

tor (32). The diÔ¨Äerence US,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ ‚àíUS,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ is a density of weight Œ¥ (see Corollary 3 and
equation (34)).
We consider now examples of groupoids and corresponding operators ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥).
4.3. Groupoid CS for a Riemannian manifold
Let M be Riemannian manifold equipped with Riemannian metric G. (As always
we suppose that M is orientable compact manifold with a chosen oriented atlas).
Riemannian metric deÔ¨Ånes principal symbol S = G‚àí1. In local coordinates Sab = gab
(G = gabdxadxb). It is principal symbol of operator of weight Œ¥ = 0.
208

Let Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ be an arbitrary connection on volume forms. The diÔ¨Äerential operator
‚àÜ= ‚àÜsing (G‚àí1,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) with weight Œ¥ = 0 transforms half-densities to half-densities.
Due to the formulae (32), (33) this operator equals to
‚àÜsing (G‚àí1,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥):

On Riemannian manifold one can consider distinguished Levi-Civita connection
on vector Ô¨Åelds. This connection deÔ¨Ånes the connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G on volume forms, such
that Œ≥G
a = ‚àíŒìb
ab = ‚àí‚àÇa log ‚àödet g, where Œìa
bc are ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols of Levi-Civita
connection.
(We also call this connection on volume forms, Levi-Civita connec-
tion.) Consider the orbit, equivalence classes [Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G] in the groupoid CG of Levi-Civita
connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G. This orbit deÔ¨Ånes the distinguished operator on half-densities on
Riemannian manifold:
‚àÜ= ‚àÜG
¬°
[Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G]
¬¢
.
One can always choose special local coordinates (xa) such that in these coordinates
det g = 1. In these local coordinates Œ≥G
a = 0 and the distinguished operator ‚àÜon
half-densities has the appearance:

deÔ¨Åning groupoid CG has the following appearance in these coordinates:

‚àí1
2Xa(x)Xa(x) = 0 .
All connections Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ such that they have appearance Œ≥a(x) = Xa(x) in these special
coordinates, where Xa(x) is a solution of this diÔ¨Äerential equation, belong to the
orbit [Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G].
209

The operator ‚àÜ
¬°
[Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥G]
¬¢
belongs in particular to the canonical pencil associated
with the Beltrami-Laplace operator (see the example 6).
On the other hand let Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ be an arbitrary connection and let œÅœÅœÅ be an arbitrary
volume form on the Riemannian manifold M. One can assign to volume form œÅœÅœÅ the
Ô¨Çat connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ : Œ≥œÅœÅœÅ
a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ. Consider operator

It is interesting to compare formulae of this subsection with constructions in the
paper [2] for a case of Riemannian structure.
Our next example is a groupoid on odd symplectic supermanifold. Before dis-
cussing it sketch shortly what happens if we consider supermanifolds instead mani-
folds.
4.4. Supermanifold case
Let M be n|m-dimensional supermanifold. Denote local coordinates of super-
manifold by zA = (xa, Œ∏Œ±) (a = 1, . . . , n; Œ± = 1, . . . , m). Here xa are even coordinates
and Œ∏Œ± odd coordinates: zAzB = (‚àí1)p(A)p(B)zBzA, where p(zA), or shortly p(A) is
a parity of coordinate zA; (p(xa) = 0, p(Œ∏Œ±) = 1).
We would like to study second order linear diÔ¨Äerential operators ‚àÜ= SAB‚àÇA‚àÇB+
. . . . Principal symbol of this operator is supersymmetric contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld
S = SAB. This Ô¨Åeld may be even or odd:
SAB = (‚àí1)p(A)p(B)SBA, p(SAB) = p(S) + p(A) + p(B) .
The analysis of second order operators can be performed in supercase in a way
similar to usual case. We have just to worry about sign rules. E.g. the formula (28)
for canonical pencil of operators has to be rewritten in the following way
‚àÜŒª = tŒ¥
2
¬≥
SAB(x)‚àÇB‚àÇA + (‚àí1)p(A)p(S+1)‚àÇBSBA‚àÇA
¬¥

¬¥
. (36)
Here ‚àÜis even (odd ) operator if principal symbol S is even (odd) tensor Ô¨Åeld (see
for detail [15]).
In the case if S is an even tensor Ô¨Åeld and it is non-degenerate then it deÔ¨Ånes
Riemannian structure on (super)manifold M. We come to groupoid CS in a same
210

way as in a case of usual Riemannian manifold considered in the previous subsection.
(We just must worry about signs arising in calculations.)
In particular for even
Riemannian supermanifold there exists distinguished Levi-Civita connection which
canonically induces the unique connection on volume forms. This connection is a
Ô¨Çat connection of the canonical volume form:
œÅœÅœÅg =
p
Ber gAB|D(z)| , Œ≥A = ‚àí‚àÇA log œÅ(z) = ‚àí(‚àí1)BŒìB
BA .
(37)
Here gAB is a covariant tensor deÔ¨Åning Riemannian structure, (SAB = gAB) and
ŒìA
BC are ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols of Levi-Civita connection of this Riemannian structure.
Ber gAB is Berezinian (superdeteriminant) of the matrix gAB. It is super analog of
determinant. The matrix gAB is n|m √ó n|m even matrix and its Berezinian is given
by the formula
Ber gAB = Ber
¬µgab
gaŒ≤
gŒ±b
gŒ±Œ≤
¬∂
= det
¬µgab ‚àígaŒ≥gŒ≥Œ¥gŒ¥b
det gŒ±Œ≤
¬∂
.
(38)
(Here as usual gŒ≥Œ¥ stands for the matrix inverse to the matrix gŒ≥Œ¥.)
The situation is essentially diÔ¨Äerent in the case if S = SAB is an odd super-
symmetric contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld and respectively ‚àÜ= SAB‚àÇA‚àÇB + . . . is an
odd operator. In this case one comes naturally to the odd Poisson structure on
supermanifold M if tensor S obeys additional conditions.
Namely, consider cotangent bundle T ‚àóM to supermanifold M with local coor-
dinates (zA, pB) where pA are coordinates in Ô¨Åbres dual to coordinates zA (pA ‚àº
‚àÇ
‚àÇzA ). Supersymmetric contravariant tensor Ô¨Åeld S = SAB deÔ¨Ånes quadratic master-
Hamiltonian, odd function HS =
1
2SABpApB on cotangent bundle T ‚àóM.
This
quadratic master-Hamiltonian deÔ¨Ånes the odd bracket on the functions on M as
a derived bracket:
{f, g} = ((f, HS) , g)),
p ({f, g}) = p(f) + p(g) + 1 .
(39)
Here ( , ) is canonical Poisson bracket on the cotangent bundle T ‚àóM.
The odd
derived bracket is anti-commutative with respect to shifted parity and it obeys
Leibnitz rule:
{f, g} = ‚àí(‚àí1)(p(f)+1)(p(g)+1){g, f},
{f, gh} = {f, g}h + (‚àí1)p(g)p(h){f, h}g .
This odd derived bracket becomes an odd Poisson bracket in the case if it obeys
Jacobi identity
(‚àí1)p((f)+1)p((h)+1){{f, g}, h} + (‚àí1)p((g)+1)p((f)+1){{g, h}, f}
+(‚àí1)p((h)+1)p((g)+1){{h, f}, g} = 0 .
(40)
It is a beautiful fact that the condition that derived bracket (39) obeys Jacobi identity
can be formulated as a quadratic condition (H, H) = 0 for the master-Hamiltonian:
(HS, HS) = 0 ‚áîJacobi identity for the derived bracket { , } holds.
(41)
211

(See for detail [14]). In the case if S is an even Ô¨Åeld (Riemannian geometry) master-
Hamiltonian H is even function and Jacobi identity is trivial (see for detail [14] and
[15].)
From now on suppose that tensor Ô¨Åeld S is odd and it deÔ¨Ånes an odd Poisson
bracket on the supermanifold M, i.e. the relation (41) holds. This odd Poisson
bracket corresponds to an odd symplectic structure in the case if the bracket is
non-degenerate, i.e.
the odd tensor Ô¨Åeld S is non-degenerate tensor Ô¨Åeld.
The
condition of non-degeneracy means that there exists inverse covariant tensor Ô¨Åeld
SBC: SABSBC = Œ¥B
C . Since the matrix SAB is an odd matrix (p(SAB) = p(A) +
p(B)+1) this implies that matrix SAB has equal number of even and odd dimensions.
We come to conclusion that for an odd symplectic supermanifold even and odd
dimensions have to coincide. It is necessarily n|n-dimensional.
The basic example of an odd symplectic supermanifold is the following: for an
arbitrary usual manifold M consider its cotangent bundle T ‚àóM and change parity
of the Ô¨Åbres in this bundle. We come to an odd symplectic supermanifold Œ†T ‚àóM.
To arbitrary local coordinates xa on M one can associate local coordinates (xa, Œ∏a)
in Œ†T ‚àóM, where odd coordinates Œ∏a transform as ‚àÇa:
xa‚Ä≤ = xa‚Ä≤(xa) ,
Œ∏a‚Ä≤ = ‚àÇxa
‚àÇxa‚Ä≤ Œ∏a .
(42)
In these local coordinates the non-degenerate odd Poisson bracket is well-deÔ¨Åned by
the relations
{xa, Œ∏b} = Œ¥a
b , {xa, xb} = 0, {Œ∏a, Œ∏b} = 0 .
(43)
(These relations are invariant with respect to coordinate transformations (42).)
Remark 9 An arbitrary odd symplectic supermanifold E is symplectomorphic to
cotangent bundle of a usual manifold M.
One may take M as even Lagrangian
surface in M. (See for detail [12].) One can consider instead supermanifold E the
cotangent bundle Œ†T ‚àóM for usual manifold M. The diÔ¨Äerence between cotangent
bundle to M with changed parity of Ô¨Åbres and supermanifold Œ†T ‚àóM is that in the
supermanifold Œ†T ‚àóM one may consider arbitrary parity preserving coordinate trans-
formations of local coordinates x and Œ∏ which may destroy vector bundle structure,
not only the transformations (42) which preserve the structure of vector bundle.
4.5. Groupoid CS for an odd symplectic supermanifold
Let E be (n|n)-dimensional odd symplectic supermanifold, where an odd sym-
plectic structure and respectively odd non-degenerate Poisson structure are deÔ¨Åned
by contravariant supersymmetric non-degenerate odd tensor Ô¨Åeld S = SAB such that
Jacobi identities (40) hold. We study second order odd operators ‚àÜ= 1
2SAB + . . .
of weight Œ¥ = 04.
4The following construction of groupoid is obviously valid in the general Poisson case, but in
this subsection we are mainly interested in the odd symplectic case
212

Let Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ be an arbitrary connection on volume forms. The diÔ¨Äerential operator
‚àÜ= ‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) of weight Œ¥ = 0 with principal symbol S deÔ¨Åned by equation (32)
transforms half-densities to half-densities. Due to the formulae (32), (33) and (36)
this operator equals to
‚àÜsing (S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥):

(45)
It is here where a similarity with Riemannian case Ô¨Ånishes. On Riemannian manifold
one can consider canonical volume form and distinguished Levi-Civita connection
which induces canonical Ô¨Çat connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ (see equation (37)). On an odd symplectic
supermanifold there is no canonical volume form 5 and there is no distinguished
connection on vector Ô¨Åelds. On the other hand it turns out that in this case one can
construct the class of distinguished connections which belong to an orbit of groupoid
CS. Namely study the equation
div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X ‚àí1
2X2 = 0 ,
(46)
which deÔ¨Ånes the groupoid CS. According to equations (34), (44) and (45) we see
that for operators ‚àÜ([Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥]) acting on half-densities we have that
‚àÜ

(47)
We call the equation (46) Batalin-Vilkovisky equation. Study this equation.
It is convenient to work in Darboux coordinates. Local coordinates zA = (xa, Œ∏b)
on supermanifold E are called Darboux coordinates if non-degenerate odd Poisson
bracket has the appearance (43) in these coordinates.
We say that connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ is Darboux Ô¨Çat if it vanishes in some Darboux coordi-
nates.
Lemma 1 Let Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ be two connections such that both connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ are Dar-
boux Ô¨Çat. Then the arrow Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ belongs to the groupoid CS. i.e. the Batalin-
Vilkovisky equation div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X ‚àí1
2X2 = 0 holds for covector Ô¨Åeld X = Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚àíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥.
5Naive generalisation of formulae (37) and (38) does not work since in particular SAB is not an
even matrix
213

We will prove this lemma later.
Remark 10 In fact lemma implies that a class of locally deÔ¨Åned Darboux Ô¨Çat connections de-
Ô¨Ånes globally the pseudoscalar function US in (44). Let {zA
(Œ±)} be an arbitrary atlas of Darboux
coordinates on E. We say that the collection of local connections {Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(Œ±)} is adjusted to Darboux
atlas {zA
(Œ±)} if every local connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(a) (deÔ¨Åned in the chart zA
(Œ±)) vanishes in these local Darboux
coordinates zA
(Œ±). Let {Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(Œ±)} and {Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤
(Œ±‚Ä≤)} be two families of local connections adjusted to Darboux
atlases {zA
(Œ±)} and {zA‚Ä≤
(Œ±‚Ä≤)} respectively. Then due to Lemma all arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(Œ±)
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥(Œ±‚Ä≤) Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤
(Œ±)
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤
(Œ±‚Ä≤)
and Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(Œ±)
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤
(Œ±‚Ä≤) belong to local groupoid CS (if charts (zA
(Œ±)), (zA
(Œ±‚Ä≤)), (zA‚Ä≤
(Œ±)) and (zA‚Ä≤
(Œ±‚Ä≤)) intersect).
This means that in spite of the fact that the family {Œ≥Œ±} does not deÔ¨Åne the global connection, still
equations (46) hold locally and operator ‚àÜ= ‚àÜ(S,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥Œ±) globally exists. (These considerations for
locally deÔ¨Åned groupoid can be performed for arbitrary case. One can consider the family of locally
deÔ¨Åned connections {Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥a} such that they deÔ¨Åne global operator (32).) On the other hand in a case of
an odd symplectic supermanifold there exists a global Darboux Ô¨Çat connection, i.e. the connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
such in a vicinity of an arbitrary point this connection vanishes in some Darboux coordinates. Show
it.
Without loss of generality suppose that E = Œ†T ‚àóM (see Remark (9).) Let œÉ be an arbitrary
volume form on M (we suppose that M is orientable). Choose an atlas {xa
(Œ±)} of local coordinates
on M such that œÉ is the coordinate volume form, i.e. œÉ = dx1
(Œ±) ‚àß. . . dxn
(Œ±). Then consider asso-
ciated atlas {xa
(Œ±), Œ∏a(Œ±)} in supermanifold Œ†T ‚àóM which is an atlas of Darboux coordinates. For
this atlas as well as for the atlas {xa
(Œ±)} Jacobians of coordinate transformations are equal to 1.
Thus we constructed atlas of special Darboux coordinates in which all the Jacobians of coordinate
transformations are equal to 1. The coordinate volume form œÅ = D(x, Œ∏) is globally deÔ¨Åned. The
Ô¨Çat connection deÔ¨Åned by this volume form vanishes. We deÔ¨Åned globally Darboux Ô¨Çat connection.
We come to Proposition
Proposition 5 In an odd symplectic supermanifold there exists a canonical orbit of
connections. It is the class [Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥] in the groupoid CS, where Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ is an arbitrary Darboux
Ô¨Çat connection. We will call this canonical class of connections ‚Äúthe class of Darboux
Ô¨Çat connections‚Äù.
For any connection belonging to the canonical orbit of connections, the pseu-
doscalar function US in (45) vanishes in arbitrary Darboux coordinates6. The op-
erator ‚àÜ= ‚àÜ[Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥] on half-densities corresponding to this class of connections has the
following appearance in arbitrary Darboux coordinates zA = (xa, Œ∏b):
‚àÜ=
‚àÇ2
‚àÇxa‚àÇŒ∏a
.
(48)
(This canonical operator on half-densities was introduced in [12].)
Now prove Lemma 1.
For an arbitrary volume form œÅœÅœÅ consider an operator
‚àÜœÅœÅœÅf = 1
2div œÅœÅœÅgrad f .
(49)
6This function vanishes not only for globally deÔ¨Åned Darboux Ô¨Çat connection but for a family
of connections adjusted to an arbitrary Darboux atlas (see Remark 10)
214

Here grad f is Hamiltonian vector Ô¨Åeld {f, zA} ‚àÇ
‚àÇzA corresponding to the function
f. (Compare with (2).) This is the famous Batalin-Vilkovisky odd Laplacian on
functions. In the case if zA = (xa, Œ∏a) are Darboux coordinates and a volume form
œÅœÅœÅ is the coordinate volume form, i.e. œÅœÅœÅ = D(x, Œ∏), then odd Laplacian in these
Darboux coordinates has the appearance
‚àÜ=
‚àÇ2
‚àÇxa‚àÇŒ∏a
.
(50)
(This is the initial form of the Batalin-Vilkovisky operator in [3].
(Geometrical
meaning of BV operator, and how formulae (49) and (50) are related with canonical
operator (48) on semidensities see in [10, 19, 12].)
The equation (46) characterising the groupoid (the Batalin-Vilkovisky equation)
is related with the Batalin-Vilkovisky operator by the following identity:
‚àíe
F
2 ‚àÜœÅœÅœÅe
‚àíF
2 = 1
4div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X ‚àí1
8X2 ,
(51)
where connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ is a Ô¨Çat connection induced by volume form (Œ≥a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ )
and vector Ô¨Åeld X is Hamiltonian vector Ô¨Åeld of the function F.
We use this identity to prove the lemma. Let connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ vanishes in Dar-
boux coordinates zA = (xa, Œ∏a) and connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ vanishes in Darboux coordinates
zA‚Ä≤ = (xa‚Ä≤, Œ∏a‚Ä≤). Then (compare with equation (11)) connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ has in Darboux
coordinates zA = (xa, Œ∏a) the following appearance
Œ≥‚Ä≤
A = ‚àÇzA‚Ä≤(zA)
‚àÇzA
(Œ≥A‚Ä≤ + ‚àÇA‚Ä≤ log J) ,
where J is Jacobian of Darboux coordinates transformation J = Ber J = Ber ‚àÇ(x,Œ∏)
‚àÇ(x‚Ä≤,Œ∏‚Ä≤)
(see also the formula (38))
Hence for the arrow Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ the covector Ô¨Åeld X equals to
XA = ‚àí‚àÇ
‚àÇza log Ber ‚àÇ(x‚Ä≤, Œ∏‚Ä≤)
‚àÇ(x, Œ∏) .
Apply identity (51) where Œ≥a = 0, œÅœÅœÅ = D(x, Œ∏) is coordinate volume form and
F = ‚àílog Ber ‚àÇ(x‚Ä≤,Œ∏‚Ä≤)
‚àÇ(x,Œ∏) . Using (49) and (50) we arrive at

The last identity is the famous Batalin-Vilkovisky identity [4] which stands in the
core of the geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky operator.
Lemma is proved.

Remark 11 The canonical operator (48) assigns to every even non-zero half density
s and to every volume form œÅœÅœÅ the functions œÉs and œÉœÅœÅœÅ:
œÉ(s) = ‚àÜs
s ,
œÉ(œÅœÅœÅ) = ‚àÜ‚àöœÅœÅœÅ
œÅœÅœÅ
(see [12]). In the articles [1, 2] Batalin and Bering considered geometrical proper-
ties of the canonical operator (48) on semidensities. In these considerations they
used the formula for expressing the canonical operator (48) in arbitrary coordinates.
This formula was suggested by Bering in [6].
Clarifying geometrical meaning of
this formula and analysing the geometrical meaning of the scalar function œÉ(œÅœÅœÅ) they
come to beautiful result: if ‚àáis an arbitrary torsion-free aÔ¨Éne connection in an odd
symplectic supermanifold which is compatible with volume form œÅœÅœÅ, then the scalar
curvature of this connection equals (up to a coeÔ¨Écient) to the function œÉœÅœÅœÅ.
Remark 12 In work [14] we have considered in particular the following ‚ÄúBatalin-
Vilkovisky groupoid‚Äù of volume forms on an odd Poisson manifold:
the arrows
œÅœÅœÅ J
‚àí‚ÜíœÅœÅœÅ‚Ä≤, where J = œÅœÅœÅ‚Ä≤
œÅœÅœÅ , are deÔ¨Åned by the Batalin-Vilkovisky equation ‚àÜœÅœÅœÅ
‚àö
J = 0.
The operator ‚àÜœÅœÅœÅ is deÔ¨Åned by equation (49). Assign to each arrow œÅœÅœÅ J
‚àí‚ÜíœÅœÅœÅ‚Ä≤ the arrow
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ of the groupoid CS such that the connections Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥,Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ are deÔ¨Åned by volume
forms œÅœÅœÅ,œÅœÅœÅ‚Ä≤ respectively (Œ≥a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ and Œ≥‚Ä≤
a = ‚àí‚àÇa log œÅ‚Ä≤). Then it follows from
equation (51) that the groupoid of volume forms is a subgroupoid of the groupoid CS.
Both the Batalin‚ÄìVilkovisky groupoid and the groupoid of connections CS consid-
ered here can be regarded as Lie groupoids over inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional manifolds, which
are the space Vol√ó(M) of the non-degenerate volume forms and the space Conx(M)
of the connections on densities on a manifold M respectively. The corresponding
Lie algebroids can be described as follows.
For the Batalin‚ÄìVilkovisky groupoid, the Lie algebroid is the vector bundle over
the (inÔ¨Ånite-dimensional) manifold Vol√ó(M) whose the Ô¨Åber over the point œÅ is the
vector space of all solutions of the equation ‚àÜF = 0 where F ‚ààC‚àû(M). The
anchor is tautological: it sends a function F to the inÔ¨Ånitesimal shift œÅ 7‚ÜíœÅ + ŒµœÅF.
A section of this bundle is a functional F[œÅ] of a volume form with values in functions
on M such that for each œÅ, the above equation is satisÔ¨Åed. The Lie bracket is the
restriction of the canonical commutator of vector Ô¨Åelds on Vol√ó(M) and can be
expressed by an explicit formula
[F, G][œÅ; x] =
Z
M
Dy œÅ(y)
¬µ
F[œÅ; y]Œ¥G[œÅ; x]
Œ¥œÅ(y)
‚àíG[œÅ; y]Œ¥F[œÅ; x]
Œ¥œÅ(y)
¬∂
.
Here we write F[œÅ; x] for the value of F[œÅœÅœÅ] ‚ààC‚àû(M) at x ‚ààM.
For the groupoid of connections (with a Ô¨Åxed tensor density Sab of weight Œ¥), the
Lie algebroid is the vector bundle over Conx(M) whose Ô¨Åber over Œ≥ ‚ààConx(M) is
the vector space of all solutions of the equation divŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥X = 0. A section is a functional
of a connection taking values in these vector spaces. The anchor is tautological: it
216

sends a covector Ô¨Åeld Xa to the inÔ¨Ånitesimal shift of the connection Œ≥a 7‚ÜíŒ≥a + ŒµXa.
The Lie bracket can be expressed by the formula
[X, Y ]a[Œ≥; x] =
Z
M
Dy

Œ¥Œ≥b(y)
‚àíYb[Œ≥; y]Œ¥Xa[Œ≥; x]
Œ¥Œ≥b(y)
¬∂
.
(For supermanifolds the formulas for the brackets contain extra signs.) Note that
since the groupoids in question are subgroupoids of the trivial (pair) groupoids, these
Lie algebroids are subalgebroids of the respective tangent bundles.
4.6. Groupoid CS for the line
We return here to simplest possible manifold‚Äîreal line. The symmetric tensor
Ô¨Åeld S of rank 2 and of weight Œ¥ on real line R is a density of the weight Œ¥ ‚àí2:
S = S‚àÇ2
x|D(x)|Œ¥ ‚àºS|D(x)|Œ¥‚àí2. Consider on R the canonical vector density |D(x)|‚àÇx
which is invariant with respect to change of coordinates. Its square deÔ¨Ånes canonical
tensor density SR = |D(x)|2(‚àÇx)2 of weight Œ¥ = 2.
We see that on the line there is a canonical pencil of second order operators of the
weight Œ¥ = 2: |D(x)|2 ¬°
‚àÇ2
x + . . .
¬¢
with canonical principal symbol SR = |D(x)|2(‚àÇx)2.
The operator (32) belonging to this pencil acts on densities of weight 1‚àíŒ¥
2
= ‚àí1
2 and
transforms them into densities of weight 1+Œ¥
2
= 3
2. According to (32) It has the
following appearance:
‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥):

UŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥(x) = ‚àí1

(52)
This is Sturm-Lioville operator recognisable by speciaialists in projective geometry
and integrable systems7 (see e.g. [9] or the book [18]).
We see that in this case the diÔ¨Äerence of operators is
‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) ‚àí‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) = ‚àí1

Here X = (Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚àíŒ≥)|D(x)|2‚àÇx is vector density of the weight Œ¥ = 2. (compare with
formulae(34) and (47)).
7The operator ‚àÜcorresponds to a curve t 7‚Üí[u1(t) : u2(t)], R ‚ÜíRP 1 in projective line deÔ¨Åned
by the solutions of equation ‚àÜu = 0.
217

Using formulae (35) we come to the following canonical groupoid CR on the line:
CR = {Groupoid of arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤such that ‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤) = ‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥), i.e. UŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ = UŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥} =
= {Groupoid of arrows Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
X
‚àí‚ÜíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ such that div Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥X + 1
2X2 = 0} ,
where ‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) is the Sturm-Lioville operator (52). It depends on the orbit of connection
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥, the class [Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥].
Analyse the equation div X + 1
2X2 = 0 deÔ¨Åning the canonical groupoid CR and
compare it with the cocycle related with the operator.
If covector Ô¨Åeld equals to Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚àíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥ = a(x)dx, then the vector density equals
to SR(a(x)dx) = a(x)|D(x)|2‚àÇx.
Hence X2 = a2(x)|D(x)|2 and div X = (ax +
Œ≥a)|D(x)|2. We come to the equation:
div X + 1
2X2 =
¬µ
ax + Œ≥a + 1
2a2
¬∂
|D(x)|2 = 0 .
Solve this diÔ¨Äerential equation.
Choose coordinate such that Œ≥ vanishes in this
coordinate. Then
X =
2dx
C + x,
where C is a constant .
(53)
On the other hand analyze the action of diÔ¨Äeomorphisms on the connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ and
the Sturm-Lioville operator (52). Let f = f(x) be a diÔ¨Äeomorphism of R. (We
consider compactiÔ¨Åed R ‚àºS1 and diÔ¨Äeomorphisms preserving orientation.) The new
connection Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(f) equals to yx
¬≥
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥
¬Ø¬Ø
y(x) + (log xy)x

dx and the covector Ô¨Åeld Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(f) ‚àíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥
equals to
X(f) = Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥(f) ‚àíŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥ = Œ≥(y(x))dy + (log xy)y dy ‚àíŒ≥(x)dx .
We come to cocycle on group of diÔ¨Äeomorphisms:
cŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥(f) = ‚àÜf(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) ‚àí‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) = ‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥f) ‚àí‚àÜ(Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥) = 1

In coordinate such that Œ≥ = 0, X(f) = (log xy)y dy. Combining with a solution

C+x. Solving this equation we see that
div X(f) + 1

¬≥
X(f)¬¥2

The cocycle (54) is coboundary in the space of second order operators and it is a
non-trivial cocycle in the space of densities of the weight 2. This cocycle vanishes
218

on projective transformations. This is well-known cocycle related with Schwarzian

cŒ≥Œ≥Œ≥(f)

4.7. Invariant densities on 1|1-codimension submanifolds in an odd
symplectic supermanifold and mean curvature
In the previous examples we considered second order operators which depend
on a class of connections on volume forms.
In particular we considered for odd
symplectic supermanifold the canonical class of Darboux Ô¨Çat connections (see the
Proposition 5) and with use of this class redeÔ¨Åned the canonical operator (48).
Now we consider an example of geometrical constructions which depend on sec-
ond order derivatives and on a class of Darboux Ô¨Çat aÔ¨Éne connections.
Let E be an odd symplectic supermanifold equipped with volume form œÅœÅœÅ. Let
C be a non-degenerate submanifold of codimension (1|1) in E (induced Poisson
structure on C is non-degenerate). We call such a submanifold ‚Äùhypersurface‚Äù.
For an arbitrary aÔ¨Éne connection ‚àáand arbitrary vector Ô¨Åeld Œ® consider the
following object:
A(‚àá, Œ®) = Tr (Œ† (‚àáŒ®)) ‚àídiv œÅŒ® ,
(55)
where Œ† is the projector on (1|1)-dimensional planes which are symplectoorthogonal
to hypersurface C at points of this hypersurface.
(We deÔ¨Åne these objects in a
vicinity of C.)
Let vector Ô¨Åeld Œ® be symplectoorthogonal to the hypersurface C at points of C.
Then one can see that at points of C
A(‚àá, fŒ®) = fA(‚àá, Œ®)
(56)
for an arbitrary function f. Thus A(‚àá, Œ®) is well-deÔ¨Åned on C in the case if Œ® is
a vector Ô¨Åeld deÔ¨Åned only at C and Œ® is symplectoorthogonal to C. This object is
interesting since it is related with canonical vector valued half-density and canonical
scalar half-density on the manifold C (see for detail [11].)
Namely let Œ® be a vector Ô¨Åeld on hypersurface C symplectoorthogonal to C.
From now on we suppose that it also obeys to following additional conditions
219

‚Ä¢ it is an odd vector Ô¨Åeld p(Œ® = Œ®A‚àÇA) = p(Œ®A) + p(A) = 1,
‚Ä¢ it is non-degenerate, i.e. at least one of components is not-nilpotent,
‚Ä¢ œâ(Œ®, Œ®) = 0, where œâ is the symplectic form in E, deÔ¨Åning its symplectic
structure.
One can see that these conditions uniquely deÔ¨Åne vector Ô¨Åeld Œ® at every point of
C up to a multiplier function. Consider now a following volume form œÅŒ® on C: Let
H be an even vector Ô¨Åeld on hypersurface C such that it is symplectoorthogonal to
C and œâ(H, Œ®) = 1. DeÔ¨Åne an half-density œÅœÅœÅŒ® by the condition that for an arbitrary
basis {e1, . . . en‚àí1; f1, . . . , fn‚àí1} of surface C
œÅœÅœÅŒ® (e1, . . . en‚àí1; f1, . . . , fn‚àí1) = œÅœÅœÅ (e1, . . . en‚àí1, H; f1, . . . , fn‚àí1, Œ®) .
(Here e1, . . . en‚àí1 are even basis vectors and f1, . . . , fn‚àí1 are odd basis vectors.)
Using formula (38) for Berezinian and relation (56) one can see that for an arbitrary
function f,
œÅœÅœÅfœà = œÅœÅœÅŒ®
f2 .
We come to conclusion that vector valued half-density Œ®‚àöœÅœÅœÅŒ® is well-deÔ¨Åned odd
half-density on hypersurface C. Applying equation (55) we come to well-deÔ¨Åned
half-density on hypersurface C: sC(‚àá) = A(‚àá, Œ®)‚àöœÅœÅœÅŒ®. This half-density depends
only on aÔ¨Éne connection ‚àá.
We say that aÔ¨Éne supersymmetric connection ‚àáon E with ChristoÔ¨Äel symbols
ŒìC
AB is Darboux Ô¨Çat aÔ¨Éne if there exist Darboux coordinates zA = (xa, Œ∏b) such
that in these Darboux coordinates the ChrsitoÔ¨Äel symbols of the connection vanish:
‚àáA‚àÇB = 0. (Darboux Ô¨Çat aÔ¨Éne connection on E induces Darboux Ô¨Çat connection
Œ≥Œ≥Œ≥ : Œ≥A = (‚àí1)BŒìB
AB on volume forms.)
Proposition 6 The half-density sC(‚àá) does not depend on a connection in the class
of Darboux Ô¨Çat connections: sC(‚àá) = sC(‚àá‚Ä≤) for two arbitrary Darboux Ô¨Çat aÔ¨Éne
onnections ‚àáand ‚àá‚Ä≤.
This statement in not explicit way in fact was used in the work [11] where the
half-density was constructed in Darboux coordinates.
The Proposition implies the existence of canonical half-density on hyperLsurfaces
in odd symplectic supermanifold. This semidensity was Ô¨Årst calculated straightfor-
wardly in [13]
On one hand the invariant semindensity in odd symplectic supermanifold is an
analogue of Poincare-Cartan integral invariants. On the other hand the construc-
tions above are related with mean curvature of hypersurfaces (surfaces of codimen-
sion 1) in the even Riemannian case: if C is surface of codimension (1|0) in Rieman-
nian manifold M then one can consider the canonical Levi-Civita connection and
canonical volume form. Applying constructions above we come to mean curvature.
220

In the odd symplectic case there is no preferred aÔ¨Éne connection compatible with
the symplectic structure(see for detail [11]).

Abstract 
The problem of Kapitza - Dirac diffraction is solved in Raman-Nath approximation 
without  imitations on resonance detuning. A formula for the scattering amplitude in a 
definite integral form is obtained. It shows that in case of initial superposition state of 
discrete Gaussian form the scattering spectrum has a new regularity, more usable  for the 
atomic optics. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Interaction of atoms with electromagnetic field has a double nature: it changes 
the population of energy levels and a momentum exchange takes place between the 
field and the atom, as a result of which the speed of atoms changes [1]. The mean 
power, which has an effect on the atom, has a resonance nature and changes the 
sign when crossing the resonance [2]. 
The problem of motion of scattering atoms in the field of counterpropagating 
waves, attracts a constant attention in atomic optics and atomic interferometry 
[3,4]. The mechanism of atom scattering in this case is the re-emission of photons 
of one wave into the other counterpropagating wave, when due to each reemitted 
photon the atom acquires recoil momentum 2 k
 , where k -is the wave vector [5,6]. 
As an unknown for each process of scattering, stand the scattering  probability 
amplitudes
n
 , corresponding to the number n of the re-emitted photons for t  
interaction time [7]. Analytical results for the scattering amplitudes, outside of 
Bragg regime, is possible to obtain only for short times of interaction, when the 
operator of kinetic energy of the atom can be neglected. This is mathematically 
equivalent to the Raman‚ÄìNath approximation. By this approximation the scattering 
amplitude with an accuracy of a phase factor are given by the n -order Bessel 
function

where the argument is a product of the Rabi frequency of the optical transition 
between the energy levels of the atom during interaction with the 
counterpropagating waves field [8].  
The characteristic form of the temporal development of the diffraction of 
atomic wave according to the formula (1) for high Rabi frequencies is shown in 
Fig.1. The development is described by two charcteristics: first, the momentum 
spectrum  is symmetrical and monotonic and second, the maximum scattering 
223 

amplitudes always remain grouped on the boundaries of distribution. For later 
discussion is important that formula (1) nevertheless is related to the case of zero or 
large resonance detuning
0
œâ
œâ
‚àÜ=
‚àí
 , where œâ  is the field frequency and 
0
œâ  is the 
atomic transition frequency. In the presented paper the expression for scattering 
amplitude, derived without limitations for ‚àÜ, will have a form of a definite integral, 
which in the limit of small and large ‚àÜ passes into a Bessel function. Thus it can 
be viewed as the generalized form of a Bessel function. 
Detailed comparison with formula (1) shows, that differences have 
quantitative nature only if the atom before interaction has a definite momentum. 
But if the moving atom is in the superposition state of many momentum states the 
evolution of atom acquires a qualitatively new content compared to the case of 
zero or asymptotically large detunings. In particular a periodic oscilliation of 
atomic beam direction from the initial one is possible too.

the case of arbitrary resonance detuning.  
 
 
        3. Numerical calculations 
 
        As shows the more detailed analysis of the situation, the biggest differences 
from the Bessel regularities are obtained, when the initial state of the atom is a 
superpositional one. For example, when at the beginning it has the following 
discrete Gaussian distribution [9]:

      For illustrating the new regularities, we will limit the discussion to the cases

. In the case 
0
Œ± =
, for example was obtained9 that if we 
proceed from the Bessel approximation for the scattering amplitudes, then initial 
Gaussian distribution in the course of interaction monotonically increases its width 
and only. Calculations according to the formula (15) give a qualitatively different 
result: the distributions are split into two identical peaks, which preserving the 
form, symmetrically move away from the distribution center. Fig.2 illustrates this   
226

Qualitative differences are present also for

. Within the framework of 
the Bessel approximation the initial Gaussian distribution is monotonically moving 
to one side with a weak change of the form. Formula (15) gives a new, oscillatory 
behavior: in the beginning the Gaussian peak, as in  Bessel approximation case, is 
moving in one direction, but soon in symmetrically opposite direction gradually 
appears a new peak, the growth of whichis accompanied by the decrease of the first 
one, before it totally disappears as in Fig.3. Subsequently the reverse process 
occurs, and two peaks, oscillating in  reversed phase, monotonically are moving 
away from the distribution center(Fig.4(a) and Fig.4(b)).  It is evident  that the 
atomic wave packet evolution preserves the Gaussian form.

Not less interesting, especially for applied optics, appears the case Œ±

case it proves to be possible to obtain a table-shaped form of momentum 
distribution, which is the base form for high resolutionspectroscopy [10]. Such a 
distribution is shown in Fig.5.

4. Coclusion 
 
The problem of resonance Kapitza-Dirac scattering of atom in the laser field 
of counterpropagating waves is solved in Raman-Nath approximation without the 
limitations put on the resonance detuning. The obtained formulas somewhat 
generalize 
the known Bessel 
functions 
expression 
for 
the 
scattering 
amplitudes. More valuable is the fact that the refinement of formula allows to 
obtain table-like momentum distribution forms, desirable in applied atomic optics

Abstract
Generating multi-photon entangled states is a primary task for applications
of quantum information processing. We investigate production of photon-triplet
in a regime of light ampliÔ¨Åcation in second-order nonlinear media under action
of a pulsed laser beam.
For this goal the process of cascaded three-photon
splitting in an optical cavity driven by a sequence of laser pulses with Gaussian
time-dependent envelopes is investigated. Considering production of photon-
triplet for short-time regime and in the cascaded three-wave collinear conÔ¨Ågura-
tion we shortly analyze preparation of polarization-non-product states looking
further applications of these results in the cascaded optical parametric oscilla-
tor. It is also demonststed the nonclassical characteritics of the photon-triplet
in phase-space on the base of the Wigner function. Calculating the normal-
ized third-order correlation functions below-and at the generation threshold
of cascaded optical parametric oscillator, we demonstrate that in the pulsed
regime, depending on the duration of pulses and the time-interval separations
between them, the degree of three-photon-number correlation essentially exceed
the analogous one for the case of continuous pumping.
1. Introduction
Multiphoton entangled states have attracted a great interest in probing the foun-
dations of quantum theory and constitute a powerful quantum resource with promis-
ing potential for various applications in quantum information technologies. Recently,
experimental eÔ¨Äorts in the direct production of multiphoton joint states, particu-
larly, three- or four-photon states have paved a new stage for the study of multi-
partite entanglement [1]. Indeed, the simultaneous generation of three photons is at
the origin of intrinsic three-particle quantum properties such as Greenberger-Horne-
Zeilinger (GHZ) -class and W-class quantum entanglement [2] - [5]. Up to now,
several physical systems have been proposed for the generation of photon triplet
including third-order nonlinear medium [6] and cascaded spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (PDC) [7, 8]. Experimentally, three-photon down-conversion was
244

studied in third-order nonlinear media [9] - [11] and also by using cascaded second-
order nonlinear parametric processes [12]. Direct generation of photon triplets using
cascaded photon-pairs has been demonstrated in periodically poled lithium niobate
crystals [1]. The distinction of three-photon GHZ and W states entangled in time
and space has been also reported [13, 14]. It was also shown that intracavity three-
photon down-conversion can be eÔ¨Äectively realized in cascaded optical parametric
oscillator (OPO) [15]. This scheme that involves cascading second-order nonlinear-
ities is based on the parametric processes of splitting and summing in which the
frequencies between the pump and two subharmonics frequencies are in the ratio of
3 : 2 : 1. Experimental realization of cascaded OPO by using the dual-grid method
of quasi-phase matching (QPM) has been done in Ref. [16]. Most recently, joint
quantum states of three-photons with arbitrary spectral characteristics have been
studied on the base of optical superlattices [17] for the cascaded conÔ¨Åguration pro-
posed in [15]. Two cascaded conÔ¨Ågurations have been considered in [17] that lead to
production of spontaneous photon triplet in cascaded PDC and generation of high
intensity mode due to cascaded three-photon splitting in optical cavity.
In this paper we continue the investigation of cascaded three-photon splitting
in an optical cavity following the paper [17]. Our goal is twofold. In one part of
the present paper we extend our previous results regarding three-photon splitting in
optical cavity for an experimentally available scheme that is a cascaded parametric
oscillator pumped by a sequence of Gaussian laser pulses (see, Sects. II and III).
The other part of the paper is devoted to studies of quantum properties of ‚Äùthree-
photon‚Äù mode. We discuss preparation of non-product states that are superposition
of three-photon polarization states, however, without any consideration of cavity
eÔ¨Äects (see, Sec. IV). We also calculate the Wigner function of the subharmonic,
i.e. ‚Äùthree-photon mode‚Äù showing the negativity in phase-space (see, Sec. V). Our
analysis includes calculation of third-order correlation function of photon numbers
for various operational regimes of pulsed OPO(see, Sec. VI). It is known, that it is
possible to control the behavior of quantum dissipative system by a train of pulses.
In this paper, we use this approach for suppression of dissipation and cavity induced
feedback in cascaded OPO that leads to increasing the level of three-photon-number

In this section we brieÔ¨Çy describe the cascaded optical parametric oscillator
(OPO) with a triply resonant optical ring cavity driven by a sequence of laser pulses.
The semiclassical and quantum theories of this device for the monochromatic pump
Ô¨Åeld were developed in Refs. [15, 17] and here we only add some important details re-
garding cascaded OPO under laser pulses with Gaussian time-dependent envelopes.
This cascaded conÔ¨Åguration involves the fundamental mode driven by an external
pump Ô¨Åeld at the central frequency œâ0 with an amplitude EL and two subharmonic
modes at the frequencies œâ1 = œâ0
3 and œâ2 = 2œâ0
3 . Due to intracavity parametric type-
245

I three-wave interactions pump Ô¨Åeld is converted to the subharmonics throughout
two cascaded processes: œâ0 ‚Üíœâ1 + œâ2 and œâ2 ‚Üíœâ1 + œâ1. Subharmonic modes have
the same plane polarizations and are all propagating in the same direction. The
pump Ô¨Åeld consists from the sequence of Gaussian laser pulses with the amplitude
E(t, z) = ELf(t)e‚àíi(œâ0t‚àíkLz),

f(t) =

n=0
e‚àí(t‚àít0‚àínœÑ)2/T 2,
(2)
where T is the duration of pulses that are separated by time intervals œÑ.
The
cascaded OPO is dissipative, because the modes suÔ¨Äer from losses due to partially
transmission of light through the mirrors of the cavity. We consider below the case
of high cavity losses for the pump mode (Œ≥0 ‚â´Œ≥, Œ≥1 = Œ≥2 = Œ≥), when the pump
mode is eliminated adiabatically in non-depletion approximation. In this case, the
eÔ¨Äective interaction Hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation reads as

In this regime, the stochastic equations of motion for the complex c-number
variables Œ±1,2 and Œ≤1,2 corresponding to the operators a1,2 and a+
1,2, have the following
form

The equations for Œ±2, Œ≤2 are obtained from (8), (9) by exchanging the subscripts
(1) ‚áå(2). Our derivation is based on the Ito stochastic calculus, and the nonzero
stochastic correlators are:

(13)
The Eqs. (8), (9) and the correlation functions modiÔ¨Åes the analogous ones derived
for OPO with monochromatic pumping [15] on the case of non-stationary pump
Ô¨Åeld.
In accordance with the cited paper, for the monochromatic driven cascaded
OPO, zero-amplitude solutions Œ±1 = Œ±2 = 0 of Eqs. (8), (9) with f(t) = 1 are
stable, if EL < Eth =
Œ≥0

‚àöŒ≥1Œ≥2, while steady-state photon numbers n1 and n2
displays histeresis-cycle behavior in a small domain 2

Thus,
remarkable feature of OPO under monochromatic pump is comparatively low gen-
eration threshold in comparison with the scheme of direct intracavity three-photon
down-conversion, where the pump power threshold is determined by third-order
susceptibility [9].
Below, we derive the threshold value for OPO driven by trains of Gaussian pulses.
The analysis of stochastic equations shows that similar to the standard OPO with
monochromatic pump Ô¨Åeld amplitude, the periodically pulsed OPO also exhibits
threshold behavior, which is easily described through the period averaged pump
Ô¨Åeld amplitude f(t) = 1

0 f(t)dt. We demonstrate this statement analyzing the
stability of zero-amplitude solutions of Œ±1 = Œ±2 = 0 of Eqs. (8), (9) for both modes
below threshold and for Œ≥1 = Œ≥2 = Œ≥. To check the stability we turn to the linearized
on the small deviations Œ¥Œ±i, Œ¥Œ≤i the equations in the semicalssical approach without
noise terms. These equations can be rewriten in the following form:

2(Œ¥Œ±¬± + Œ¥Œ±‚àó
¬±), Œ¥Y¬± = 1
2i(Œ¥Œ±¬± ‚àíŒ¥Œ±‚àó

simple form
Œ¥X¬±(t) = Œõ¬±(t, t0)Œ¥X¬±(t0),

(18)
Analyzing semiclassical equations and operational regimes we choose the switch-
ing time in inÔ¨Ånity, i.e.
t0 ‚Üí‚àí‚àû, and add in (2) terms with negative n.
In
this case, the function f(t) is periodic on time f(t + œÑ) = f(t) and the analysis is
simpliÔ¨Åed. Since the function f(t) is periodic on time, we can obtain the general
formula
R t
t0 f(t)dt = f(t)(t ‚àít0) + F(t) ‚àíF(t0), where F(t) is a periodic function,
F(t + œÑ) = F(t). Therefore, we see from (16), (17), (18) that the solution Œ±i = 0
below-threshold is stable if EL < Œ≥0Œ≥
œá1 f(t). It is easy to check also that due to noted
periodicity of the amplitude the following formula takes place (see, for example [18])

n=‚àí‚àû
e‚àí(t‚àínœÑ)2/T 2 =

(19)
This formula allows us to calculate the averaged value of the amplitude f(t). On the
whole, we arrive to the result that for the case of Gaussian pulses above threshold
regime is realized if
EL ‚â•Eth =

T‚àöœÄEth =

(20)
The important peculiarity of the system proposed is that the threshold value Eth de-
pends on the coupling constant œá1 which is related to the second-order susceptibility
as well as depends on the characteristics of laser pulses.
3. Numerical simulation of dissipation and decoherence
The cascaded OPO is dissipative, because the modes suÔ¨Äer from losses due to
partial transmission of light through the mirrors of the cavity and due to quantum
Ô¨Çuctuations. We analyse dissipative and decoherence eÔ¨Äects on the base of master
equation for the density operator of the cavity modes in the Limbland form

We calculate the quantities of interest (the photon number distributions, Wigner
functions, etc.) mainly for the subharmonic mode (1) by using the reduced density
operator œÅ1(t) which is constructed from the density operator œÅ(t) of both modes
by tracing over the mode (2), œÅ1(t) = Tr2(œÅ).
We analyze the master equation
numerically using quantum state diÔ¨Äusion method (QSD) [19]. According to this
method, the reduced density operator is calculated as the ensemble mean

tory. The stochastic equation for the state |œàŒæ(t)‚ü©involves Hamiltonian described by
Eq. (3) and the Linblad operators described by noise terms in the master equation
(21). We calculate the density operator using an expansion of the state vector |œàŒæ‚ü©

Details of analogous calculations for an anharmonic oscillator in time-modulated
Ô¨Åeld can be found in [20]). The numerical simulations are performed in the trun-
cated Fock basis of the subharmonic modes that are limited by 500 photons. This
approximation is valid for the case of strong nonlinear couplings œá1 and œá2 with
respect to the dissipation parameters.
4. Production of polarization, non-product states of photon triplet
in collinear conÔ¨Åguration
Three-photon correlations allow the creation of tripartite entangled states such
as the GHZ state.
For cascaded SPDC in noncollinear conÔ¨Åguration spatially-
polarization GHZ states has been considered in [17]. Below we apply the results ob-
tained for preparation of three-photon polarization states in collinear conÔ¨Åguration
of interacting waves. Recently, a simple but highly eÔ¨Écient source of polarization-
entangled photon pairs at nondegenerate wavelengths and in collinear conÔ¨Åguration
has been demonstrated [21]. We consider the production of polarization-entangled
photon triplet. It is possible for the case when cascaded processes involve polarized
photons.
Thus, we modify the above results considering three-wave interaction with the
indexes of polarization states. Looking further applications of above results for in-
tracavity three-photon down-conversion in collinear conÔ¨Åguration of cascading pro-
cesses we concentrate on consideration of non-product states that are entangled
only on polarization degree of freedom but not on spatial variables. Thus, including
into consideration the polarization states of the photons we assume that the type-II
process œâ0 ‚Üíœâ1 + œâ2 create the pair of photons with a vertical V, (a1(V ), (a2(V ))
and horizontal H, (a1(H), (a2(H)) polarizations in collinear conÔ¨Åguration.
If the
pump Ô¨Åeld is oriented at 45‚ó¶to the horizontal and vertical axes two processes
œâ0 ‚Üíœâ1(V ) + œâ2(H) and œâ0 ‚Üíœâ1(H) + œâ2(V ) take place in the Ô¨Årst crystal.
The next process is considered as the type-I parametric process. In type-I conver-
sion, photon pairs are created with the same polarization state, but ortogonal to the
input mode. Therefore, the second, type-I crystal is arranged in the manner that
the following process: œâ2(H) ‚Üíœâ1(V )+œâ1(V ) and œâ2(V ) ‚Üíœâ1(H)+œâ1(H) should
be realized.
For simplicity, we restrict our attention considering frequency-uncorrelated three-
photon states and assume that the process under photons with (V ) and (H) polar-
249

izations are described by the equal coupling constants. Thus, we assume that photon
pairs in three-wave processes : œâ0 ‚Üíœâ1 +œâ2, œâ2 ‚Üíœâ
‚Ä≤
1 +œâ‚Äù
1 have correlations on the
polarization, but not on the spectral lines. In analogy with Eq.(3), we model the sum
of the corresponding parametric interactions by the following eÔ¨Äective Hamiltonian
H = H1 + H2,
(24)
H1 = i‚ÑèœáE0f(t)(a+
1 (V )a+
2 (H) + a+
1 (H)a+
2 (V )) + h.c.,
(25)
H2 = i‚Ñèk[(a2(V )(a+
1 (H))2 + a2(H)(a+
1 (V ))2)] + h.c..
(26)
Here, a1(V ) and a2(V ) are the annihilation operators of modes (1) and (2) at ver-
tical polarizations, while the operators a1(H), a2(H) corresponds to the horizontal
polarized photons of the frequencies œâ1 and œâ2, respectively.
We focus on analysing the generation of non-product states for one-passing con-
Ô¨Åguration of cascaded parametric spontaneous processes without consideration of
cavity dynamics and feedback eÔ¨Äects.
This approach is valid for short interac-
tion time intervals much shorter than the characteristics relaxation time. In this
case time-evolution of the vector state of the system is described by the second-
order term of the perturbation theory. Choosing the initial state as a vacuum state
|œàin‚ü©= |0‚ü©a1(H)|0‚ü©a2(H)|0‚ü©a1(V )|0‚ü©a2(V ) for all modes we derive the Ô¨Ånal state during
time evaluation in the following form

(27)
where ¬Øœá = œát and ¬Øk = kt are the coupling constants and the states |V ‚ü©= a+
1 (V )|0‚ü©a1(V )
|H‚ü©= a+
1 (H)|0‚ü©a1(H) present the vertical and horizontal polarization states of pho-
tons at the frequency œâ1 = œâ0
3 . Thus, we demonstrate that in this collinear, one-
dimensional cascaded scheme triple photons can constitutes the polarization entan-
gled (non-product) states of light. It should be noted that under cavity feedback
eÔ¨Äects the non-product quantum state cannot be described by this simple expres-
sion and we should include the higher-order terms of the perturbation expansion
into consideration.
5. Photon triplet in phase-space: Wigner functions and photon
number distributions in the pulsed regime
Quantum interference signature of three-photon states in phase-space has been
demonstrated for the direct three-photon down-conversion in third-order nonlinear
medium [6, 9] as well as in the cascaded scheme [17] for the case of monochromatic
pumping. We demonstrate now this eÔ¨Äect for the pulsed regime of cascaded OPO.
We illustrate these eÔ¨Äects numerically on the base of the master equation, however,
250

in the regimes when the dissipation in the cavity is unessential and the dynamic of
modes is almost unitary. For the cavity conÔ¨Åguration presented, the validity of such
approximation is guaranteed by consideration of short interaction time for which
the duration of pulses are much shorter than the characteristics relaxation time,
1/(œá1E0), 1/œá2 << t << 1/Œ≥1,2 , provided that the nonlinear coupling constants
exceed the dumping rates for the modes.
Below, we present the results on the photon-number distributions and Wigner
functions for three-photon mode. The photon number distribution for œâ1 = œâ0
3 mode
is calculated as the diagonal element P1(n) = ‚ü®n|œÅ|n‚ü©of photonic Fock states while
calculations of the Wigner function for the this mode are performed by using its
standard formula in a Fock space:
W1(œÅ, Œ∏) =
X
m,n
œÅ1,mnWmn(œÅ, Œ∏)
(28)
.
Here, œÅ, Œ∏ are the polar coordinates in the complex phase space which is deter-
mined by the position and the momentum of quadratures x = (a + a+)/
‚àö
2, y =
(a ‚àía+)/
‚àö
2i, respectively, while the coeÔ¨Écients Wmn(œÅ, Œ∏) are the Fourier trans-
forms of the matrix elements of the Wigner characteristic function.
Three-photon structure of the mode is shown on photon-number distributions in
Figs. 1 (a, d). As we see, for short time-intervals, the most probable values of pho-
ton numbers are separated by three photons. In Figs.1 (b, e) we present results on
the Wigner functions that clearly exhibit phase-space quantum interfringes. These
results describe the case of cascaded OPO under two consecutive pulses with the
duration TŒ≥ = 1 ‚àó10‚àí3 separated by the interval œÑŒ≥ = 6 ‚àó10‚àí3. Fig.1(b) shows the
Wigner function evolved for a time interval t = t0+6.2‚àó10‚àí3Œ≥‚àí1 that corresponds to
maximal photon number nmax of the Ô¨Årst pulse; Fig.1 (e) shows the Wigner function
at t = t0 + 6.2 ‚àó10‚àí2Œ≥‚àí1 corresponding to nmax of the second pulse. The Wigner
function shows three phase components with an interference pattern in the regions
between them. We show the regions of quantum interference in the contour plots
(see, Figs.1 (c, f)) depicting negative regions of the interference terms in black. Note
that threefold symmetry of the Wigner function and interference pattern has been
demonstrated for the direct three-photon down-conversion in œá(3) media [6, 9]. How-
ever, we note that the results presented here for the pulsed cascaded conÔ¨Åguration
are also diÔ¨Äerent in details from the analogous calculation of the Wigner function
for the case of monochromatic pump Ô¨Åeld [17].
6. Photon-number correlation in the pulsed regime
The experimental veriÔ¨Åcation of time-dependent correlation between photons in
triplet has been demonstrated for one-passing conÔ¨Åguration of cascaded SPDC [1].
Considering production of photon triplet in a cavity, it seems that the correlation

between photons can be evidently displayed for short interaction time intervals much
shorter than the relaxation time. Nevertheless, the three-photon number correla-
tion exceeding the coherent level, (that means the normalized third-order correlation
function g(3) > 1), has been demonstrated for cascaded OPO driven by monochro-
matic pumping, in over transient regime for modes generated below the threshold
[17]. This eÔ¨Äect decreases if the system moves to the range of the generation thresh-
old. At the threshold, the typical value for the normalized third-order correlation
function for zero delay-time, g(3) = 1.2, has been obtained.
In this Secion, we demonstrate the new regimes of strong three-photon correla-
tion for the pulsed cascaded OPO. We concentrate on numerical simulation of both
the mean photon number of subharmonics as well as the third-order correlation func-
tion. Let us now discuss photon-number correlation in the time domain, considering
output twin light beams from the pulsed cascaded OPO on the base of normalized
third-order photon-numbers correlation function g(3) for the mode (1)
g(3)(t) = Tr(a+3
1 a3
1œÅ1(t))/n3(t).
(29)
Here, n(t) = Tr(a+
1 a1œÅ1(t)) is the mean photon number. Considering three-photon
number correlation for the intensive cavity mode in the presence of dissipation and
cavity induced feedback, we control quantum dynamics of dissipative systems by
a train of pulses. Here, we use this approach for controlling quantum statistics of
mode, particularly for increasing the level of three-photon-number correlation. We
analyze the cases in which TŒ≥ ‚â§1 and œÑŒ≥ ‚â•1, for over transient time-intervals,
t ‚â´Œ≥‚àí1, considering the operational regimes below-and at the generation threshold.
Typical results for the mean photon numbers and the correlation function g(3) for two
diÔ¨Äerent parameters of the Gaussian pulses : T = Œ≥‚àí1, œÑ = 10Œ≥‚àí1 and T = Œ≥‚àí1, œÑ =
5Œ≥‚àí1 are presented in Figs. (2) and (4).
As we see from these Ô¨Ågures, the time-
dependence of these quantities repeat the periodicity of the pump laser over transient
time intervals. We also conclude that the maxima of the three-photon correlation are
realized for the deÔ¨Ånite time intervals for which the mean photon number of mode
(1) is in the ranges between its maxima and minima. As shown our calculations,
such strong photon correlations take place in nonstationary regime of cascaded OPO
when duration of pulses is close to a characteristic dissipation time. In Figs. (2) we
analyze the mean photon number (Fig. 2(a)) and the correlation function (Fig.2(b))
in the operational regimes of OPO at the generation threshold. In the regime below
the generation threshold, at E/Eth = 0.5 the correlation function display two-peak
structure (see, curve (2)). The lower peak corresponds to the time intervals for which
the mean photon number is between its minimal and maximal values. More correctly,
for the period trains of intervals t = t0 + m11.6Œ≥‚àí1, (m = 1, 2, ...), the mean photon
number n = 50 and the correlation function g(3) = 8.9. The other peaks correspond
to the minimal values of the mean photon number. At the threshold (see, curves (1))
the eÔ¨Äect of photon correlation is decreased, although the level of correlation exceeds
the coherent level, g(3) > 1, particularly, we get g(3) = 3.4 for the mean photon
number n=251. Thus, we found a remarkable result that the degree of three-photon
number correlation for the pulsed regime of OPO surpass the analogous result for

OPO with continuous pumping for the same mean photon numbers. Indeed, this
conclusion is illustrated in Figs. (2) and (3), where the comparison of the results on
pulsed regime with the calculations based on the Hamiltonian (3) with f = 1 is done.
Note, that the ideal limit of continuous pumping is realized if T ‚Üí0, œÑ ‚Üí‚àûfor the
case of inÔ¨Ånity numbers of pulses. We present on the Figs. (3) the results for OPO
with continuous pumping at the threshold EL = Eth, in which the mean photon
number n = 52 in the steady state regime (curve (2), Fig. 2(a)) approximately
equals to the maximal value of the photon number in the pulsed regime. However,
as we see, the level of the maximal correlation, g(3) = 9 in this case exceeds the
analogous one for the case of continuous pumping, g(3) = 1.2.
It is natural to explain such improvement of three-photon correlation by control
the behavior of a quantum system by an external time-dependent force. The presence
of these eÔ¨Äects in the cascaded OPO, particularly, can been seen from the noise-
correlation functions. Indeed, the equation (10) describes a multiplicative noise-
term, where the level of noise is determined by the amplitude of pulsed driving Ô¨Åeld
ELf(t) leading to the control of dissipation. In this spirit, we emphasize that the
idea of controlling the dynamics of a quantum system in the presence of dissipation
and decoherence by an external periodic driving was exploited by many authors
(see, for example, [22] and the references therein). In one of the standard techniques
control of the optical quantum system is achieved through the application of suitable
tailored, synchronized laser pulses [23].
In this way, it is interesting to analyze

considered in Figs. 2. The results are presented in Figs. 4 in the regime below the

the correlation function reach to g(3) = 75 for n = 1.1 (curves (1)) for time-intervals
between pulses, œÑ = 10Œ≥‚àí1. Decreasing of the time-separation between pulses leads
to decreasing of the correlation function (see, curves (2), where œÑ = 5Œ≥‚àí1).
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have studied quantum properties of photon triplet cardinally
diÔ¨Äerent from those of twin photons. Because photon-triplet originates from a single
laser photon, the quantum correlations take place between all three photons allowing
the creation of entangled, non-product states. The production of photon-triplets in
the presence of stimulation radiative processes, cavity feed-back eÔ¨Äects and dissipa-
tion have been investigated. We have demonstrated the possibility to create polar-
ization, non-product states of photon-triplet for one-passing, collinear conÔ¨Åguration
of cascaded parametric spontaneous processes. We have also illustrated three-photon
structure of sub-harmonic mode on the base of both the photon-number distribution
and the Wigner function. We have demonstrated the operational regimes depending
on the durations of pulses and the intervals between them that guarantees strong

Magnetic properties, classical and quantum phase
transitions in anti-ferromagnetic models

Abstract
The magnetization plateaus, biÔ¨Äurcation points and chaos are playing the
greate role in the classical and quantum phase transitions. We obtained three-
cycle windows of antiferromagnetic Potts and magnetization plateaus of anti-
ferromagnetic Ising model with multisite interactions. Using Gibbs-Bogolubov
inequality the quantum entanglement (concurrence) of antiferromagnetic spin-
1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on the triangulated kagome and two dimentional
kagome (Ô¨Çuid 3He) lattices are investigated.
1. Introduction
Entanglement is considered to play a key role for the understanding of strongly
correlated quantum systems, quantum phase transitions and collective quantum
phenomena in particular many-body spin and fermionic lattice models [1]. One can
introduce the fundamental connection between quantum transitions in d dimensions
and certain well studied Ô¨Ånite temperature phase transitions in classical statistical
mechanics in d+1 dimension [2]. The magnetization plateaus have played a great role
in understanding of a large family of nontrivial quantum phenomena of spin systems
[3]. The experimental [4] and theoretical [5] studies suggest that three-site exchanges
are dominant in solid 3He atoms, which have 1/2 spin [6]. One can obtain magneti-
zation plateaus with multiple-spin exchange using the dynamical and transfer matrix
methods [7]. In this paper I would pay attention to the researching of classical phase
transitions, magnetisation plateaus, stable cycles of Potts antiferromagnetic model
and quantum entanglement of spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg model on the triangulated
kagome lattice, solid and Ô¨Çuid 3He models with multi spin-exchanges.
2. Bifurcation points and chaos
The Potts and Ising models played an important role in the theories of phase
transitions and critical phenomena [8]. The aim of this section is to analyze the
cyclic period-3 window for rational mappings describing the antiferromagnetic Q-
state Potts model on the Bethe lattice (Q < 2) and the antiferromagnetic Ising model
with three-site interaction on the Husimi cactus (tree). This window is represented
240

by the laminar phase with an incorporated chaotic behavior. The transition from the
chaotic regime to the period-3 regime occurring through tangent bifurcation (type-I
intermittency) [9], as well as subsequence doubling of the period through the type-II
intermittency (doubling bifurcation), is considered.
In the presence of external magnetic Ô¨Åeld, the Q-site Potts model on the Bethe
lattice is speciÔ¨Åed by the Hamiltonian
H = ‚àíJ
X
(i,j)
Œ¥(œÉi, œÉj) ‚àíH

Œ¥(œÉi, Q),
(1)
where œÉi = 1, 2, . . . , Q; and Œ¥(x, y) is the Kronecker delta; the Ô¨Årst and second sums
are taken over all of the edges and sites of the lattice, respectively; and J < 0
corresponds to antiferromagnetic pairing. The partition function and magnetization
at the central site can be represented as
Z =

M = ‚ü®Œ¥(œÉ0, Q)‚ü©= Z‚àí1 X
{œÉ}
Œ¥(œÉ0, Q)e‚àí

kBT ,
(2)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant (below, we set kB = 1). Cutting the Bethe
lattice at the central site into Œ≥ identical branches (Œ≥ is the coordination num ber),
we represent the partition function in the form
Z =
X
{œÉ0}
exp{H
T ¬∑ Œ¥(œÉ0, Q)}[gn(œÉ0)]Œ≥,
(3)
where œÉ0 is the central spin and gn(œÉ0) is the contribution of each of the identical
branches. Following a known procedure described in [10], we obtain
xn = f1(xn‚àí1),
f1(x) = e
H
T + (e
J
T + Q ‚àí2)xŒ≥‚àí1

T
+ (Q ‚àí1)xŒ≥‚àí1
,
where xn = gn(œÉ Ã∏= Q)/gn(œÉ = Q). Using these equations, one can express magne-
tization via x.
We study the transition from the chaotic regime to the cyclic period-3 regime
through tangent bifurcation. Certain values of the temperature T and magnetic Ô¨Åeld
H specify a curve separating the chaotic and period-3 regimes (the mapping in the
latter regime has three stable stationary points). In this curve, tangent bifurcation
occurs under the condition
(

(x) = x
(f(3)

(x))‚Ä≤ = 1, (i = 1, 2).
(4)
where f(3)(x) = f{f[f(x)]}. Subsequent bifurcations, responsible for the appearance
of a stable cycle with a period of 3 √ó 2n(n = 2, 3, . . . ), correspond to the doubling
of the period.
When an H = const line intersects only the upper curve (corresponding to Eq. (4)
with i = 1), the boundaries of the cyclic window are strictly distinguished (tangent

bifurcation occurs at both edges).
This window is represented only by the 3M0
phase (a stable period-3 cycle) (see Fig. 1a). The phase transition between the 3M0
and 3M1 phases, accompanied by a change in symmetry, occurs at the bifurcation
points. With a further decrease in the Ô¨Åeld, new bubbles corresponding to modulated
phases with larger periods will appear on bifurcation diagrams. Finally, the chaotic
regime, which is localized inside the cyclic period-3 window, will be reached. At the
same time, when the magnetization is considered as a function of the temperature
T at a Ô¨Åxed value H < 0.1 or as a function of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld H at any Ô¨Åxed
temperature, tangent bifurcation occurs only at one edge of the cyclic window [11].
A crisis [12, 13], i.e., the collision of the chaotic attractor with the independent
unstable stationary point with a period of 3, occurs at the other edge (see Fig. 1b).
In this case, modulated phases with a period of 3 √ó 2n are not localized inside the
window (similarity with logistic mapping).
3. Magnetization plateaus and frustrated systems
In this section the dynamical (recursive) approach was used to study magnetic
properties of a kagome chain. The magnetization plateaus were found at low tem-
peratures and moreover, the kagome chain was separated into four sublattices with
diÔ¨Äerent magnetizations. Two of these exhibited plateaus, whereas the others did
not. The stability of the system is described by Lyapunov exponents [15] by means
of which the exponential rate is measured, at which the adjacent orbits converge or
diverge [14, 15]. It is interesting to check whether the maximum Lyapunov exponent
has plateaus that coincide with the magnetization one. According to [7] the multiple
spin exchanges Hamiltonian can be written as

2 (1 + œÉiœÉj) ,
(6)
where œÉi is the Pauli matrix, acting on the spin at the i-th site. The expressions for
P3, P4, . . . can be calculated using (6). By using these expressions one can rewrite
the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of Pauli matrices. By taking into account that
in a strong external magnetic Ô¨Åeld directed along the z-axis the contribution from
x and y spin component will be negligible and the only relevant contribution will
come from the z component (which can eÔ¨Äectively take values sz = ¬±1), we may
consider an Ising model instead of Heisenberg one. By using expressions for P3, and
P6 and by substituting the Pauli matrix with sz we get the Ising approximation of
the Heisenberg Hamiltonian:

where the Ô¨Årst sum goes over all pairs in the hexagon, and the second one goes over
all quartets in the hexagon.
To obtain recursion relations for the partition function one can separate the
kagome ladder into two identical parts (branches) and Ô¨Årstly perform a summation
over all spin conÔ¨Ågurations on each branch, and secondly sum over the central spin
variable (see Fig. 2). The summation on each branch yields the same result and
such a term only depends on the value of central spin:

be written (s1 . . . s11, see Fig. 2) in the form:

The recursion relation is obtained by introducing a new variable xn = gn(+)/gn(‚àí):
xn = K(+, +)xn‚àí1 + K(+, ‚àí)
K(‚àí, +)xn‚àí1 + K(‚àí, ‚àí).
(12)
where
K(s1, s12) =

By using this equations one can write for the magnetization of the central vertex

At the same way one can obtain the magnetizations of the non-central vertexes.
Because of the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, the values of magnetization for some
spins are equal: we have in general (See Fig. 2),

In Figure 3a magnetization curves are plotted for diÔ¨Äerent sites. As it can be seen
from the Ô¨Ågures, the magnetization functions have plateaus only for the sublattices
B and C. In magnetisation curves there are regions with unusual nonmonotonous

magnetisation behaviour.
In Figure 3b plotted the average magnetization of all
sublattices and the Ô¨Ågure show that the curve is smooth and monotonous as it
should be.
It is interesting to calculate the Lyapunov exponent near plateaus but one cannot
use recurrent function (12) because it is related to s1 site. To obtain the recursion
relation for the partition function that is related to s2 site one can separate the
kagome chain into two identical parts as shown in Figure 4:
Z =
X
s1,s2, p1,p2

2T H(6)o
(17)
and the contribution of each branch is denoted by gn(s1, s2). The recursion relations
for gn can be obtained by performing eleven (s3 . . . s13, see Fig. 4) summations in
the kagome chain:
gn(s1, s2) =
X
s12,s13
Ks1, s2
s12,s13 ¬∑ gn‚àí1(s12, s13),
(18)
where Ks1, s2

Since Ks1, s2
s12,s13 = Ks2, s1
s12,s13, Ks1, s2
s12,s13 = Ks1, s2
s13,s12 one can show that gn(+, ‚àí) = gn(‚àí, +)
and, hance,the recurrence relations are two-dimensional.
By introducing xn =
gn(+, +)/gn(‚àí, ‚àí) and yn = gn(+, ‚àí)/gn(‚àí, ‚àí) the recursion relations may be writ-
ten in the following form:
xn = Œ¶(xn‚àí1, yn‚àí1), Œ¶(x, y)

The magnetization can be expressed in terms of xn, yn with due regard for (16) and
(17)
Relations (20) permit the calculation of Lyapunov exponents near the plateaus.
At Ô¨Årst we shall give deÔ¨Ånition of Lyapunov exponent for an one-dimensional case.
For display xn+1 = f(xn) Lyapunov exponent characterizes exponential divergence
of two next points after n iterations [14, 15]. By deÔ¨Ånition in the two-dimensional

One of the basic features of chaos is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions
and the Lyapunov exponents provide quantitative measures of response sensitivity
of a dynamical system to small changes in initial conditions. For a chaotic orbit at
least one Lyapunov exponents is positive, implying exponential divergence of nearby
orbits, while in the case of regular orbits all Lyapunov exponents are zero. There-
fore, the presence of positive Lyapunov exponent is a signature of chaotic behavior.
Usually the computation of only the maximal Lyapunov exponent is suÔ¨Écient for
determining the nature of an orbit, because it guarantees that the orbit is chaotic.
The results of calculation are shown in Fig. 5 with the corresponding magnetiza-
tion function: it is seen in the Ô¨Ågures that the maximum Lyapunov exponent also
exhibits plateaus. Moreover, for the maximum Lyapunov exponent the location of
magnetization plateaus coincide with those of magnetization curves.

4. Thermal entanglement on a triangulated
Kagome lattice
The eÔ¨Äorts aimed at better understanding of the aforementioned phenomena
stimulated an intensive search of two-dimensional geometrically frustrated topolo-
gies. From this perspective, the most interesting geometrically frustrated topologies
are the magnetic materials in form of two-dimensional isostructural polymeric coor-
dination compounds Cu9X2(cpa)6 ¬∑ nH2O (X = F, Cl, Br and cpa=carboxypentonic
acid) [16].
We consider the spin-1
2 Ising-Heisenberg model on triangulated kagome lattice
(TKL) (Fig. 6) consisting of two types of sites (a and b). Since the exchange cou-
pling between Cu2+ ions are almost isotropic, the application of the XXX Heisen-
berg model is more appropriate. There is a strong Heisenberg Jaa exchange coupling
between trimeric sites of a type and weaker Ising-type one (Jab) between trimeric a
and monomeric b ones. Thus, the kagome lattice of the Ising spins (monomers) con-
tains inside of each triangle unit a smaller triangle of the Heisenberg spins (trimer).
The Hamiltonian can be written as follows:
H = Jaa

where Sa = {Sa

y, Sa
z } is the Heisenberg spin-1
2 operator, Sb is the Ising spin.
Jaa > 0 corresponds to antiferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling and Jab > 0 to ferro-
magnetic Ising-Heisenberg one. The Ô¨Årst two summations run over a ‚àía and a ‚àíb
nearest neighbors respectively and the last sum incorporates the eÔ¨Äect of uniform
magnetic Ô¨Åeld (we have assumed that the total number of sites is 3N).

where H is the real Hamiltonian which describes the system and H0 is the trial one.
F and F0 are free energies corresponding to H and H0 respectively and ‚ü®...‚ü©0 denotes
the thermal average over the ensemble deÔ¨Åned by H0. Following [18] we introduce
the trial Hamiltonian in the following form:

Using the fact that in terms of (26) Sa and Sb are statistically independent, one
obtains ‚ü®Sa ¬∑ Sb‚ü©0 = ‚ü®Sa‚ü©0 ¬∑ ‚ü®Sb‚ü©0. Besides, taking into account that ‚ü®(Sz)a‚ü©0 = ma
(single a-site magnetization), ‚ü®(Sz)b‚ü©0 = mb (single b-site magnetization), we obtain
the following expression:

Minimizing the RHS of (27) in order to Œ≥a, Œ≥b and Œªaa and using the fact, that

Œ≥b = 4Jabma + H. Parameters Œ≥a and Œ≥b, which have a meaning of a magnetic Ô¨Åeld,
are interconnected, which is the consequence of its‚Äò apparent self-consistency.

We study concurrence C(œÅ), to quantify pairwise entanglement [19], deÔ¨Åned as
C(œÅ) = max{Œª1 ‚àíŒª2 ‚àíŒª3 ‚àíŒª4, 0},
(30)
where Œªi are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator for
the density matrix

(31)
in descending order. Since we consider pairwise entanglement, we use reduced den-
sity matrix œÅ12 = Tr3œÅ. We can calculate the concurrence for each of them on cluster
level individually in eÔ¨Äective magnetic Ô¨Åeld. In our case the density matrix has the
following form
œÅ =

Z0a

k=1
exp(‚àíEk/T)|œàk‚ü©‚ü®œàk|,
(32)
Ek, |œàk‚ü©and Z0a are taken from equations (7), (8) and (9) respectively. The con-
struction process of matrix (31) does not depend whether Œ≥a is eÔ¨Äective or real
248

magnetic Ô¨Åeld, although the presence of eÔ¨Äective Ô¨Åeld Œ≥a plays crucial role for the
self-consistent solution. Here we skip the speciÔ¨Åc details and provide the result of
Ô¨Ånal calculations of the matrix œÅ12, taking into account that the Hamiltonian Hc0 is
translationary invariant with a symmetry [Sz, Hc0] = 0 (Sz = P3
k=1(Sz)a

such a density matrix has the following form:
C(œÅ) = 2
Z max(|y| ‚àí‚àöuv, 0).
(34)
Finally, we consider transcendental equations (28) and (29) by taking into account
the values of variational parameters: Œªaa = Jaa, Œ≥a = 2Jabmb +H, Œ≥b = 4Jabma +H,
and, therefore, one can use these parameters to calculate C(œÅ). First, we study the
behavior of C(œÅ) at H = 0. The temperature dependence of C(œÅ) is shown in Ô¨Ågure

Another important observation is that threshold temperature at which entan-
glement C(œÅ) disappear is identical to the critical temperature Tc of second order
phase transition between ordered and disordered phases. This implies that the con-
currence vanishes precisely at Tc, the same temperature of speciÔ¨Åc heat discontinuity.
This is the consequence of the fact that at Tc the system undergoes order-disorder
phase transition and the second term in Œ≥a vanishes, too (mb = 0, when H = 0 and
T ‚â•Tc). This factor implies the strong relationship between magnetic and entan-
glement properties of the system. In Ô¨Ågure 7b we present the three dimensional plot
of the concurrence as a function of the temperature and external magnetic Ô¨Åeld.

5. Magnetic properties and concurrence for 3He
In the present section mean-Ô¨Åeld like approach, based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov
inequality (24), was used to study entanglement and magnetic properties of a two
dimensional kagome lattice. The key result of the section is concentrated on the
comparison of speciÔ¨Åc (peaks and plateaus) features in magnetization, susceptibility
and thermal entanglement properties in the above mentioned model using variational
mean-Ô¨Åeld like Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality.
According [6] the third layer of 3He system is kagome lattice (see Fig 8) and
Hamiltonian for kagome lattice can be written in the following form:

ferent non-interacting rectangles (see Fig. 8 ) and
Œ≥œÖ = Œ≥a
for sublattice (a),
Œ≥œÖ = Œ≥b
for sublattice (b).
It should be emphasized that in trial Hamiltonian spins œÉi
k of the ‚àÜi-th triangle do
not interact with the spins œÉj
k of the ‚àÜj triangle if i Ã∏= j, therefore these spins are
250

statistically independent. The real Hamiltonian H (35) can be represented in the
following form
H =

(37)
where H(i) is the contribution of spins on the single triangle in real Hamiltonian
H and index of summation ‚àÜi runs over the diÔ¨Äerent triangles (see Fig. 8, grey

Œ≥b = h ‚àí(J2 ‚àíJ3)ma.
(40)
Minimizing the right hand side of (40) in order to Œ≥a, Œ≥b and Œª and using the fact,
that ‚àÇf0
‚àÇŒª = ‚ü®Œ±‚ü©0 and ‚àÇf0

The dependance of magnetization ma from external magnetic Ô¨Åeld h can be found
by solving the this recursive equation for each value of magnetic Ô¨Åeld h. At relatively
high temperatures the recursive equation has one stable solution and therefore mag-
netization curves of sublattices (a) and (b) coincide (see Fig. 9(a)). With decreasing
temperature the solution of recursive equation ceases to be stable and, therefore, the
magnetization of diÔ¨Äerent sublattices are no longer equal. The partially saturated
phase emerges in form of the magnetization plateaus (see Fig. 9(b) for T = 0.01 mK,
J2 = 3 mK, J3 = 2.5 mK), which can be associated with a staggered magnetization
or short range antiferromagnetism (AF) in frustrated kagome geometry. Indeed, the
appearance of plateaus in magnetization curve at m = ¬±1/6 can be explained as sta-
bility of trimeric states in available (‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì, ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üë, ‚Üì‚Üë‚Üë) and (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì, ‚Üì‚Üë‚Üì, ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì) conÔ¨Ågurations.

It is curious to discuss some similarities of statistical and quantum characteristics
of our system. We consider magnetization as a statistical characteristic. In Ô¨Ågure
10(a) plotted the magnetization as a function of the coupling constant J2 (for Ô¨Åxed
value of J3 = 2.5 mK) and the external Ô¨Åeld h, at a relatively high temperature
T = 0.2 mK. As a quantum characteristic we consider entanglement (concurrence
C(œÅ)).
In Ô¨Ågure 10(b) the concurrence as a function of the J2 (J3 = 2.5 mK)
is shown for the same value of temperature. Our calculations show that the mag-
netic characteristics is similar to that of bipartite entanglement. Indeed, comparison
of Ô¨Ågures 10(a) and 10(b) shows that regions corresponding to the magnetization
plateaus, coincide with the plateaus on concurrence plot.

6. Conclusions
A cyclic period-3 window has been studied in the antiferromagnetic Potts model
on the Bethe lattice. We have analyzed the mechanism of the transition from the
chaotic regime to the cyclic period-3 window through tangent bifurcation followed
by the doubling cascade 3 √ó 2n(n = 2, 3, . . . ). In the present paper the theory
of dynamical systems has been used to study magnetization on the kagome chain.
Exact recursion relations have been derived for the partition function. The magne-
tization curves for diÔ¨Äerent temperatures and exchange parameters were obtained
and the kagome chain was observed to split into four sublattices with diÔ¨Äerent mag-
netizations. A multidimensional mapping was deduced to study the maximum Lya-
punov exponent near the plateaus and it was shown that the location of plateaus
on the maximal Lyapunov exponent and for magnetization was the same. We found
strong correlations between magnetic properties and quantum entanglement in spin-
1
2 Ising-Heisenberg model on triangulated kagome lattice, which has been proposed
to understand a frustrated magnetism of the series of Cu9X2(cpa)6 ¬∑ nH2O polymeric
coordination compounds. We also Ô¨Ånd strong correlations between magnetic prop-
erties and quantum entanglement in the Heisenberg model with two-, and three-site
exchange interactions in strong magnetic Ô¨Åeld on the kagome lattice, which corre-
spond to the third layer of Ô¨Çuid 3He absorbed on the surface of graphite. We adopted
variational mean-Ô¨Åeld-like treatment (based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality) of
separate clusters in eÔ¨Äective magnetic Ô¨Åelds and studied magnetic properties and
concurrence as a measure of pairwise thermal entanglement. We have found, that in
the antiferromagnetic region behavior of the concurrence coincides with the magne-
tization one. The comparison of magnetization and concurrence shows that regions
corresponding to the magnetization plateaus, coincide with the plateaus on concur-
rence plot.

Abstract
We determine the maximal work extractable via a cyclic Hamiltonian pro-
cess from a positive-temperature (T > 0) microcanonical state of a N ‚â´1 spin
bath. The work is much smaller than the total energy of the bath, but can
be still much larger than the energy of a single bath spin, e.g. it can scale as
O(
‚àö
N ln N). Qualitatively same results are obtained for those cases, where the
canonical state is unstable (e.g., due to a negative speciÔ¨Åc heat) and the micro-
canonical state is the only description of equilibrium. For a system coupled to
a microcanonical bath the concept of free energy does not generally apply, since
such a system‚Äîstarting from the canonical equilibrium density matrix œÅT at the
bath temperature T‚Äîcan enhance the work exracted from the microcanonical
bath without changing its state œÅT . This is impossible for any system coupled
to a canonical thermal bath due to the relation betweem the maximal work and
free energy. But the concept of free energy still applies for a suÔ¨Éciently large
T. Here we Ô¨Ånd a compact expression for the microcanonical free-energy and
show that in contrast to the canonical case it contains a linear entropy instead
of the von Neumann entropy.
1. Introduction
How much work can be extracted from a state of a physical system via cyclic
processes? This question governs our understanding of energy conversion and stor-
age, and hence is central for thermodynamics [1]‚Äì[8]. The basic answer, known as
the Thomson‚Äôs formulation of the second law, is that an equilibrium state cannot
yield work. This formulation is an axiom in thermodynamics, but its Ô¨Årst-principle
derivations were given in literature for a canonical (Gibbsian) equilibrium state [2].
The main consequence of the Thomson‚Äôs formulation is that only non-equilibrium
states can be sources of work. The maximal work extractable from such states via
a cyclic process was studied both for macroscopic [1] and Ô¨Ånite systems [4, 5, 6].
One instance of the maximal work is especially well-known, because it provides
the physical meaning of free energy [1]. Consider a quantum system with Hamil-
258

tonian H and initial density matrix œÅ. This system is in contact with a canonical
thermal bath at temperature T. External Ô¨Åelds act cyclically on the system + bath.
Assuming no system-bath coupling both initially and Ô¨Ånally, the maximal work ex-
tracted by the Ô¨Åelds reads [1, 9]
Wmax = F[œÅ] ‚àíF[œÅeq],
F[œÅ] = tr(œÅH) + Ttr(œÅ ln œÅ),
(1)
where F[œÅ] is the free energy and œÅeq = e‚àíH/T /tr[e‚àíH/T ] is the canonical equilibrium
state of the system, which is its Ô¨Ånal state after work-extraction [1]. The maximal
work is determined by the deviation of œÅ from its canonical equilibrium value œÅeq as
quantiÔ¨Åed by the free energy (1).
One notes however that all above results refer to a speciÔ¨Åc notion of equilibrium,
viz.
the canonical state.
Another concept of equilibrium is given by the micro-
canonical state, which describes an isolated system equilibrated due to its internal
mechanism [10], or an open system coupled weakly to its environment (so weak that
no energy is exchanged) [8, 11]. This is a more fundamental notion of equilibrium: (i)
under certain conditions the canonical state can be derived from it for a weakly cou-
pled subsystem [1]. (ii) In contrast to the canonical state, whose preparation refers
to an external thermal bath, the microcanonical state can be applied to a closed
few-body system provided that it satisÔ¨Åes certain chaoticity features [12, 13]. (iii)
Since local stability conditions of the canonical state are more demanding‚Äîa fact
closely related to the no work-extraction feature[1]‚Äîthere are situations, where the
equilibrium can be described by the microcanonical state only, since the canonical
state for them is unstable [14]. For such systems, frequently realized via long-range
interactions, the entropy is a non-concave function of energy, and hence the notori-
ous macroscopic equivalence between canonical and microcanonical state is broken
[14]. Even if this macroscopic equivalence holds, it is by no means obvious that
in the argument around (1) one can substitute the canonical state of the thermal
bath by the microcanonical state [with the same temperature], because in general
the work (1) is not a macroscopic quantity, i.e. it does not scale with the number of
bath particles. This is however widely done in literature, e.g., when introducing the
free energy as in (1) one basically never speciÔ¨Åes the equilibrium state of the bath;
see, e.g. [1, 7].
We revisit the maximal work-extraction problem for a thermal bath in a quan-
tum microcanonical state. It was noted already some work can be extracted via a
cyclic Hamiltonian process from a few-particle microcanonical system [3]. Recent
papers studied to which extent the extraction of work from one-particle classical mi-
crocanonical system can be carried out by physically realistic Hamiltonians [15, 16].
Our purposes here are diÔ¨Äerent:
‚Ä¢ We focus on Ô¨Ånding the maximal amount of work extractable from a macro-
scopic microcanonical state of N ‚â´1 particle thermal bath.
‚Ä¢ We also determine the work extracted via a system coupled to a microcanonical
thermal bath, and check whether the reasoning (1) generalizes at least qualitatively,
i.e. whether the concept of free energy applies to the microcanonical situation.
259

The subject of work extraction via a system coupled to a thermal bath is an active
research topic. Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] discuss various set-ups for this problem:
quantum, classical, with or without state-dependent feedback etc. Recall that (1) is
at the core of relations between statistical thermodynamics and information theory
[7]. The term tr([œÅ‚àíœÅeq]H) in the right-hand-side of (1) is the energy extracted from
the system, while the remaining (entropic) part comes from the bath. If tr([œÅ‚àíœÅeq]H)
is negligible (e.g., because H contains only few almost degenerate energy levels), the
work is extracted from the bath due to the diÔ¨Äerence between the initial entropy and
its canonical equilibrium value. This relation between the entropy and work is the
essential part of information driven engines (e.g., Szilard‚Äôs engine) [7]. In contrast,
various forms of fuel operate due to the initial non-equilibrium energy, i.e. the term
tr([œÅ ‚àíœÅeq]H) in (1).
2. Microcanonical thermal bath
The microcanonical state is characterized by two parameters: energy E and
width œÉ [1]. The corresponding density matrix is diagonal in the energy represen-
tation, all energies within the interval [E, E ‚àíœÉ] have equal probabilities, all other
energies have probability zero. For a N ‚â´1-particle system the number d(E, œÉ) of
energy levels within the interval [E, E ‚àíœÉ] deÔ¨Ånes the microcanonical entropy [1]:
S(E) = ln d(E, œÉ) = O(N),
(2)
where the choice of œÉ should not inÔ¨Çuence the leading O(N) behavior of S(E).
Eq. (2) is the von Neumann entropy for the microcanonical density matrix (6);
see also [21]. For clarity we want to work with a speciÔ¨Åc model of a macroscopic
microcanonical system (bath). This is the basic model of the Ô¨Åeld: N ‚â´1 uncoupled
two-level spins; each spin has energies 0 and Œ¥ > 0 [8]. Some of our results extend
to more general bath models, as seen below.
The bath Hamiltonian reads (diag[. . .] means diagonal matrix in the energy rep-
resentation)
H = diag[0, Œ¥, 2Œ¥ . . . , Œ¥N],
(3)
where each element Œ¥k is repeated dk times,
dk ‚â°
N!
k!(N ‚àík)!.
(4)
Hence every energy shell Œ¥k is dk‚Äìdegenerate. Denote
ek = (1, . . . , 1),
0k = (0, . . . , 0),
Dk ‚â°
Xk
m=0dm,
(5)
where ek (0k) is the vector of k 1‚Äôs (0‚Äôs).
For the present model of bath the microcanonical state is easy to deÔ¨Åne: all
energies Œ¥M have equal probability
1
dM ; all other energies have zero probability.
260

Thus we put œÉ ‚Üí0, the minimal thermodynamically consistent width for this
model. Note that the degenerace of the energy levels is convenient, since it allows
to set œÉ ‚Üí0. It is however not essential: an eÔ¨Äective degeneracy will be anyhow
regained for a small but Ô¨Ånite œÉ > 0, since the energy levels of a macroscopic system
are located very densely [1]. The bath initial state reads in representation (3)
‚Ñ¶i =
1
dM
diag[ 0DM‚àí1, edM , 0DN‚àíDM ].
(6)
For N ‚â´1 this microcanonical state does have desired features expected from ther-
modynamics, e.g. macroscopic equivalence with the canonical state, equilibration
of a small subsystem, third law [8]. The density matrix of a single bath spin is
Gibbsian ‚àùdiag[1, e‚àíŒ¥/T ] with [8]
e‚àíŒ¥/T = m/(1 ‚àím),
m = M/N.
(7)
The same T is recovered as microcanonical temperature [1]
1/T = ‚àÇS(E)/‚àÇE,
E = Œ¥M,
S(E) = ln dM,
(8)
where S(E) is the microcanonical entropy (2). This equivalence can be shown via
formula (17) that is proven below.
Note that although the spins are uncoupled, the microcanonical state does not
reduce to the tensor product of the separate spin states (otherwise it would amount
to the canonical state). It contains inter-spin correlations. Ultimately, this is the
reason why, as seen below, a microcanonical bath can yield work in a cyclic process.
We restrict ourselves with M/N ‚â§1/2, i.e. positive temperatures. The case with
M/N > 1/2 is deÔ¨Ånitely less interesting, because now each spin of the bath is in a
state with a negative temperature. Such states are trivially active, i.e. they yield
work in a cyclic process.
3. Work extraction
At some initial time t = 0 the bath Hamiltonian H(t) becomes time-dependent
due to interaction with sources of work. Consider a cyclic process
H(0) = H(œÑ) = H,
(9)
where œÑ is the Ô¨Ånal time.
The work extracted in this thermally isolated cyclic
Hamiltonian process is
W = tr(H[‚Ñ¶i ‚àí‚Ñ¶f]) = Œ¥M ‚àítr(H‚Ñ¶f), ‚Ñ¶f = U‚Ñ¶iU‚Ä†,
(10)
where ‚Ñ¶f is the Ô¨Ånal state of the bath, and U = T e‚àí(i/‚Ñè)
R œÑ
0 dsH(s); T means chronolo-
gization. Conversely, for a given unitary U one can construct a class of Hamiltonians
that generate U and satisÔ¨Åes (9) [5].
261

Condition (9) is necessary for the system to be an autonomous carrier of energy
that should deliver work to another system (e.g., to a work-source) via an interaction
which switches on and oÔ¨Äat well-deÔ¨Åned times. Hence this is a cyclic Hamiltonian
process.
We now maximize the work W‚Äîor minimize the Ô¨Ånal energy tr(H‚Ñ¶f)‚Äîover all
cyclic Hamiltonians, i.e. over unitary operators U. Note from (10) that
tr(H‚Ñ¶f) =
X2N
a,b=1EaCab‚ü®b|‚Ñ¶i|b‚ü©,
Cab ‚â°|‚ü®b|U|a‚ü©|2,
(11)
Cab ‚â•0,
X2N
a=1Cab =
X2N
b=1Cab = 1,
(12)
where {Ea}2N
a=1 and {|a‚ü©}2N
a=1 are, respecitively, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
H [see (3)], and the elements {‚ü®b|‚Ñ¶i|b‚ü©}2N
b=1 are deÔ¨Åned in (6).
Three conditions
in (12) mean that the matrix Cab is double-stochastic [22]. Conversely, every such
matrix can be represented as Cab ‚â°|‚ü®b|U|a‚ü©|2 for some unitary U [22]. Every double-
stochastic matrix equals to a convex sum of permutation matrices Œ†[Œ±] (BirkhoÔ¨Ä‚Äôs
theorem [22]): C = P
Œ±ŒªŒ±Œ†[Œ±], P
Œ±ŒªŒ± = 1, ŒªŒ± ‚â•0, where each matrix Œ†[Œ±] acting
on a column-vector x amounts to permuting (in a certain way) the elements of x.
Eq. (11) shows that tr(H‚Ñ¶f) is a linear function of the matrix C = {Cab}. Hence its
minimum over the unitary operators U, that is its minimum over double-stochastic
matrices Cab, is reached for Cab equal to some permutation matrix eŒ†. It is clear from
(11) that eŒ†, when acting on the vector ‚ü®b|‚Ñ¶i|b‚ü©permutes its elements such that all
its non-zero [equal to each other] elements concentrate at lowest energies {Ea}2N
a=1
[5]. For the Ô¨Ånal state we have ‚ü®a|‚Ñ¶f|a‚ü©= P
beŒ†ab‚ü®b|‚Ñ¶i|b‚ü©. Hence the lowest-energy
Ô¨Ånal state compatible with ‚Ñ¶i reads
‚Ñ¶f =
1
dM
diag[ edM, 0DN‚àídM ].
(13)
Once eŒ† is found we can employ the standard procedure of constructing the cor-
responding unitary operator U and the cyclic Hamiltonian [5]. Note that eŒ† does
depend on the energy of the initial state ‚Ñ¶i: eŒ† applied on a microcanonical state
with a diÔ¨Äerent energy will not lead to the maximal work-extraction. This does not
diÔ¨Äer from (say) the ordinary Carnot cycle, whose implementation also demands
knowing the initial state of the working body.
The maximal work Wmax reads from (13, 10): Wmax = Œ¥M ‚àí
Œ¥
dM [PM‚àí‚Ñì
k=0 k dk +
(M ‚àí‚Ñì+ 1)(dM ‚àíPM‚àí‚Ñì
k=0 dk)]. After summation by parts,
Wmax = Œ¥
¬∑
‚Ñì‚àí1 + 1
dM

(14)
where Dk is deÔ¨Åned in (5), and where integer ‚Ñì= ‚Ñì(M) is found from
XM‚àí‚Ñì+1
k=0
dk > dM ‚â•
XM‚àí‚Ñì
k=0 dk.
(15)
262

Eq. (14, 15) hold for any microcanonical state (3, 6); the speciÔ¨Åc form (4) is not
necessary.
We shall now calculate Wmax for two limits: T ‚Üí‚àûand a Ô¨Ånite N, and then
N ‚Üí‚àûand a Ô¨Ånite T.
4. Doubly maximized work
We set the number of spins N to a large, but a Ô¨Ånite number, and maximize
Wmax(T) over all positive temperatures of the N-spin bath. The maximum is reached
for T = ‚àû(or M = N/2 as (7) shows) and provides an upper bound for the
work extractable from the positive temperature bath. We now calculate Wmax(‚àû).
Consider the sumP N
2 ‚àí‚Ñì
k=0 dk = P N
2
m=‚Ñìd N
2 ‚àím in (15). The dominant summation region
is m ‚àº‚Ñì. We shall see below that ‚Ñì‚â™N. Hence for (4) we use the Gaussian
approximation d N
2 ‚àím = 2

. The second term under
square root is negligible if ln N is large. Eq. (14) then implies (for N ‚â´1):
Wmax = Œ¥

(16)
This is a reachable upper bound for the work extractable from the N-spin micro-
canonical bath.
5. Finite temperatures and thermodynamic limit
We employ (4) and assume the standard thermodynamic limit: m = M/N < 1/2
(and hence T > 0) in (7) is a Ô¨Åxed Ô¨Ånite number for M, N ‚Üí‚àû. We note from (4)
and (7) that for any Ô¨Åxed Ô¨Ånite numbers m, ‚Ñìand N ‚Üí‚àû,
dNm‚àí‚Ñì
dNm
= e‚àí‚ÑìŒ¥/T [ 1 + O( 1
N ) ].
(17)
Since the sums in (14, 15) are dominated by their largest terms, using (17) (with
m < 1 and integer ‚Ñì) amounts to calculating these sums via geometrical progression,
e.g.,
1
dM
PM‚àí‚Ñì+1
k=0
dk = P‚àû
k=‚Ñì‚àí1 e‚àíŒ¥k/T . We get for ‚Ñìand Wmax
Wmax(T) = Œ¥

,
(18)
v ‚â°e‚àíŒ¥/T ,
‚Ñì=

ln v

(19)
where ‚åàx‚åâis the ceiling (upper) integer part of x, e.g., ‚åà0.99‚åâ= 1, ‚åà‚àí0.99‚åâ= 0.
According to (19), ‚Ñìgrows to inÔ¨Ånity with T: ‚Ñì= 1 for e‚àíŒ¥/T ‚â§

2, ‚Ñì= 2 for
2

2, ‚Ñì= 3 for 0.68232 ‚â•e‚àíŒ¥/T ‚â•
2
1+
‚àö
5 etc.
263

Wmax(T) is a continuous function of T, but dWmax
dT
has jumps at the temperatures,
where ‚Ñìchanges, and one energy shell in the Ô¨Ånal density matrix (13) is completely
Ô¨Ålled; see (15) and Fig. 1. Hence
Wmax(T) = O(Œ¥) for N ‚â´1 and T = O(Œ¥).
(20)
The situation is symmetric with respect to diÔ¨Äerent spins of the bath. Hence after the
work-extraction the initial energy of each bath spin changes negligibly = O( 1
N ). The
Ô¨Ånal state of each spin is diagonal in the energy representation and thus after work-
extraction it has a well-deÔ¨Åned temperature that diÔ¨Äers from the initial temperature
by O( 1
N ). Recall that the Gibbsian state as such cannot yield work in a cyclic process
(9) [2]. Hence the work is extracted due to inter-spin correlations present initially
in the microcanonical state.
Eq. (18) shows that Wmax(T) increases faster than T:
Wmax(T) = T
¬∑
ln
¬µT
Œ¥
¬∂
+ 1
¬∏
for T ‚â´Œ¥,
(21)
where we used
l
ln(1‚àív)
ln v
m
‚âàln(1‚àív)
ln v
. Eq. (21) is practically good already for T > 1.5 Œ¥.
Now Wmax can be much larger than the energy of a single bath spin. In the limit
T ‚â´Œ¥ this energy is equal to Œ¥/2; see (7).
6. Microcanonical states not equivalent to the canonical one
Eq. (20) does not depend on the concrete form (4) of dk. What is needed for (20)
is that the sum PM
k=0dk is dominated by its last term dM. Then (15) implies ‚Ñì=
O(1), and (14) leads to (20). Hence (20) generalizes the Thomson‚Äôs formulation of
the second law to the microcanonical situation. In particular, (20) holds for those dk,
where the macroscopic equivalence between microcanonical and canonical states is
violated. As an example consider (3, 6) with dM = eN(M/N)2. This spectrum satisÔ¨Åes
all above conditions and leads to (20). Now the entropy ln dM is a convex function
of energy Œ¥M. Hence the speciÔ¨Åc heat C = [
dT
d(Œ¥M)]‚àí1 calculated from (8) is negative,
and the macroscopic equivalence between canonical and microcanonical states is
clearly violated, because C > 0 is an automatic consequence of the canonical state
[1]. Such convex-entropy spectra are realized in macroscopic long-range interacting
systems [14].
Another example of convex entropy and canonical-microcanonical non-equivalence
where still (20) holds, is the Ô¨Årst-order microcanonical phase transition [1, 14], where
in the vicinity of some critical energy Ec, dS(E)
dE
has a jump:
dS(E)
dE |E‚ÜíEc+ =
1
Th ,
dS(E)
dE |E‚ÜíEc‚àí= 1
Tl . This describes coexistence of two phases with diÔ¨Äerent temper-
atures. Since a more stable phase should have a larger entropy, we get Th < Tl
[1]. The above non-equivalence is seen here, because at a canonical Ô¨Årst-order phase
transition diÔ¨Äerent phases have the same temperature [1]. Even though two phases
at diÔ¨Äerent temperatures do co-exist, the extracted work has the same order of
magnitude (20) as for a homogeneous-temperature microcanonical state.
264

7. System coupled to the bath
An important instance of the maximal work problem is the amount of work
extractable from a thermal bath in the presence of a smaller system coupled to it;
see (1). How much work can be extracted from a combined state of a two level system
with energies 0 and œµ > 0 and the microcanonical thermal bath? Answering this
question will alow us to understand to which extent the concept of the free energy
applies to the microcanonical situation. Before starting the analysis we should like
to stress again that so far the statistical physics literature does not distinguish
between canonical and microcanonical situations when introducing and applying
the free energy concept; see e.g. [1].
Let the initial density matrix of the two-level system be œÅi; its eigenvalus are
œÄ0 > œÄ1. The spectrum of the overall initial state Ri ‚â°œÅi ‚äó‚Ñ¶i reads [see (6, 5)]
Spec[Ri] =
1
dM
[ œÄ0edM, œÄ1edM, 02DN‚àí2dM ], œÄ0 > œÄ1.
(22)
Both initially and Ô¨Ånally the two-level system and bath do not interact. Hence the
overall Hamiltonian H reads
H
=
H(œÑ) = HS ‚äó1 + 1 ‚äóH
(23)
=
diag[0, Œ¥, 2Œ¥ . . . , Œ¥N, œµ, œµ + Œ¥, . . . , œµ + Œ¥N],
(24)
where H is given by (3), and HS is the two-level Hamiltonian with energies 0 and
œµ. We recall that each symbol kŒ¥ (or œµ + kŒ¥) in (24) is repeated dk times. Once
we consider unitary work-extraction processes, the Ô¨Ånal state of the overall system
will have the same eigenvalues (22). Recalling our discussion between (11) and (13)
it should be clear that the minimal Ô¨Ånal energy for the overall system is achieved
for the unitary operator that forces Rf to have the same eigenvectors as H and
permutes the eigenvalues (22) such that the largest eigenvalue is matched with the
smallest energy, next to the largest eigenvalue with the next to the smallest energy
and so on. Note that Spec[Ri] is already ordered in a non-increasing way. It remains
to order (24) in a non-decreasing way and write the lowest Ô¨Ånal average energy as
scalar product of two vectors
tr(HRf) = Spec[Ri] ¬∑ [ 0, Œ¥, . . . , Œ±Œ¥, œµ,
(25)
(Œ± + 1)Œ¥, œµ + Œ¥, . . . , Œ¥N, œµ + Œ¥(N ‚àíŒ±), . . . , œµ + Œ¥N ],
where Œ± = ‚åäœµ
Œ¥‚åã, and ‚åäx‚åãis the Ô¨Çoor (lower) integer part of x, e.g., ‚åä0.99‚åã= 0,
‚åä‚àí0.99‚åã= ‚àí1.
Consider the work extracted from the overall system that is maximized over all
unitary dynamic operators. Since the system and bath do not interact both initially
and Ô¨Ånally, this work separates into two parts coming, respectively, from the system
and bath [see (10, 14)]:
tr(H[Ri ‚àíRf]) = Wmax + Wsur + tr(HS[œÅi ‚àíœÅf]),
(26)
265

where tr(HS[œÅi ‚àíœÅf]) is the energy change of the two-level system. Wmax + Wsur
is the work coming from the bath. Here Wmax is given by (14) (the maximal work
extracted from the bath alone) and we deÔ¨Åned the surplus work Wsur (work extracted
from the bath, but due to the system).
Obviously, Wsur+tr(HS[œÅi‚àíœÅf]) ‚â•0, since tr(H[Ri‚àíRf]) results from optimizing
over a larger set of parameters than Wmax. Note that tr(HS[œÅi ‚àíœÅf]) appears also in
the right-hand-side of (1), and there is some analogy between Wsur and the entropy
diÔ¨Äerence T(tr[‚àíœÅeq ln œÅeq + œÅ ln œÅ]) in (1), which is the work extracted from the
canonical bath.
There the work Wmax extracted from the canonical equilibrium
bath alone (without the system) is zero.
Scalar product (25) is calculated straightforwardly; for clarity we focus on the
thermodynamic limit regime (17):
Wmax + Wsur
=
Œ¥[œÄ1F2 + (œÄ0 ‚àíœÄ1)F1],
(27)
tr(HSœÅf)
=
œµ[œÄ1P2 + (œÄ0 ‚àíœÄ1)P1],
(28)
where Wmax is given by (18) and we deÔ¨Åned for k = 1, 2:

Recall that sign(0) = 0, Œ± = ‚åäœµ
Œ¥‚åã, and that ‚åäx‚åãand ‚åàx‚åâare deÔ¨Åned after (25) and
(18), respectively.
The Ô¨Ånal state œÅf of the two-level system is diagonal in its energy representation.
The eigenvalues of œÅf are read-oÔ¨Äfrom (28). The excited state of œÅf is less populated
than the ground-state; otherwise it can still provide work via a cyclic process. In this
speciÔ¨Åc sense the two-level system partially equilibrates; recall that œÅi is arbitrary.
Fig. 1 displays Wmax(T) and Wsur(T) for a representative range of parameters.
It is seen that for Œ± = 0, Wsur ‚â•0 and both Wmax and Wsur monotonically increase
with T. For Œ± > 0 the positivity of Wsur is recovered only for a suÔ¨Éciently high T
provided that œÄ0 Ã∏= œÄ1; see Fig. 1. For œÄ0 = œÄ1, we always get Wsur < 0.
Consider now œµ < Œ¥ [i.e.
Œ± = 0 in (25)] and assume v ‚â°e‚àíŒ¥/T ‚â§1/3 for
simplicity. Eqs. (27‚Äì30) produce
Wsur

Eq. (31) shows that, in addition to Wsur + tr(HS[œÅi ‚àíœÅf]) ‚â•0, the work extracted
from the bath is enhanced, Wsur > 0, for any state of the two-level system besides
the completely mixed one, where œÄ0 = œÄ1 = 1
2.
The energy diÔ¨Äerence tr(HS[œÅi ‚àíœÅf]) can be positive or negative. Hence parame-
ters can be tuned such that it is zero, e.g., from (32) and for œµ = T ln 2 < T ln 3 < Œ¥
we get that initially canonical equilibrium two-level system, œÄ0 = 1 ‚àíœÄ1 = (1 +
e‚àíœµ/T )‚àí1 =
2
3, enhances the work extracted from the bath without changing its
marginal state: tr(HSœÅf) = 0. Hence for enhancing the work extracted from the
microcanonical bath one needs that the system is ordered: its state should not be
completely mixed, while the maximal enhancing is achieved for a pure state. But
the state of the system need not change.
A non-equilibrium system coupled to canonical equilibrium bath can enhance
the work extracted from the bath only at the cost of changing (towards equilibrium)
its initially non-equilibrium state; see (1). The free energy measures this change.
For the microcanonical bath, the work can be enhanced already by an equilibrium
two-state system without changing its marginal state. We conclude that the concept
of the free energy does not generally apply to a system coupled to a microcanonical
bath.
But this concept applies in the high-temperature limit. For T ‚â´Œ¥, œµ we get from
(27‚Äì30) and from (21):
Wsur = (1 ‚àí2œÄ1)T ln 2,
(33)
tr(HSœÅf) = œµ/2.
(34)
Eq. (34) means that the Ô¨Ånal state of the two-level system is completely mixed, which
for the present high-temperature case coincides with the canonical equilibrium state.
Eq. (33) predicts work-enhancement only if initially the two-level system was out
267

of equilibrium [recall that 1
2 ‚â•œÄ1]. Hence for T ‚â´Œ¥, œµ we recover the logics of
the canonical-bath situation, but not its letter, because for a canonical bath Wsur
reduces to the diÔ¨Äerence between two von Neumann entropies that are logarithmic
functions of the initial eigenvalues œÄ0 and œÄ1; cf. our remark after (26).
We shall show elsewhere that a for a ¬µ-level system in a state (density matrix)
œÅ with eigenvalues ordered as œÄ0 ‚â•œÄ1 ‚â•... ‚â•œÄ¬µ‚àí1, we can deÔ¨Åne the linear entropy
as
L[œÅ] =
X¬µ‚àí1
k=1 œÄk[(k + 1) ln(k + 1) ‚àík ln k].
(35)
Generalizing (33), the surplus work Wsur extracted from a high-temperature mi-
crocanonical bath in contact with this system is then Wsur = T(ln ¬µ ‚àíL[œÅ]) =
T(L[ ÀÜ1
¬µ] ‚àíL[œÅ]), where ÀÜ1
¬µ is the maximally mixed state of the ¬µ-level system. For
the canonical situation this expression involves the von Neumann entropy ‚àítr[œÅ ln œÅ]
instead of L[œÅ]. Note that ln ¬µ ‚â•L[œÅ] ‚â•0: the upper (lower) limit is reached for the
maximally mixed (pure) œÅ.
Hence for a system in initial state œÅ and Hamiltonian HS coupled to the high-
temperature microcanonical bath one can deÔ¨Åne the microcanonical free energy
F[œÅ] = tr(HSœÅ) ‚àíTL[œÅ], whose diÔ¨Äerence F[œÅ] ‚àíF[œÅeq] (after adding to Wmax
extracted from the bath alone) deÔ¨Ånes the maximal work extracted from the sys-
tem+bath.
8. Summary
We reformulated the Thomson‚Äôs formulation of the second law for a N ‚â´1
particle equilibrium bath in a microcanonical state: if the bath temperature T is
Ô¨Ånite, the maximal work extractable from the bath via a cyclic Hamiltonian process
is ‚â≥Œ¥, where Œ¥ is the energy of a single bath particle. The maximal work tends to
Œ¥
‚àö
N ln N if N is large but Ô¨Åxed and T ‚Üí‚àû. The reformulation applies equally
well to both ordinary microcanonical states, which are macroscopically equivalent to
canonical states, and convex-entropy microcanonical states for which no canonical
state can be deÔ¨Åned, e.g., because of a negative speciÔ¨Åc heat [14]. The existence of
such states demonstrates that a viewpoint on a microcanonical state as emerging
from measuring the energy of the canonical state is not generally valid. Thermody-
namics of such systems can have peculiarities [24], but we saw that they satisfy the
same generalized Thomson‚Äôs formulation much in the same way as ordinary micro-
canonical states. The work extraction is possible, since the microcanonic state of
the bath is not Gibbsian, though each its constituent can be in a Gibbsian state.
It is widely known that only a non-equilibrium system can lead‚Äîat expense of
changing its state towards equilibration‚Äîto work extraction from a canonical bath
[1]. This work is given by the free energy diÔ¨Äerence (1). In contrast, a canonical
equilibrium system (having the same temperature as the bath) can enhance the work
extracted from the microcanonical bath without changing its marginal state. Hence
268

the concept of free energy, in the sense of the maximal work, does not generally
apply to the microcanonical situation. The application of the concept is recovered
for T ‚â´Œ¥, but the canonical expression of the free energy is not restored, instead it
should be formulated via the linear entropy (35).

Abstract
We revisit Kaluza-Klein compactiÔ¨Åcation of 11-d supergravity on S7 and
go to S7/Zk using group theory techniques. We show that there is no Higgs
mechanism responsible for the supersymmetry breaking. We analyze Kaluza-
Klein towers and compute their partition functions.
1. Some generalities on Superstring Theory
A theory of fundamental one-dimensional objects, strings, arose in the late 1960s
in an attepmt to understand the strong nuclear force [1]. String theory contains
open and closed strings. Open strings can end on a (p+1) dimensional hypersurface
called Dp-brane. In this theory speciÔ¨Åc particles correspond to speciÔ¨Åc oscillation
modes (or quantum states) of the string. One of the most important features of
string theory is that it contains general relativity. The graviton is in the spectrum
of closed string. Bosonic string theories are inconsistent. The consistency of the
theory requires supersymmetry. There ara Ô¨Åve superstring theories- Type IIA, Type
IIB, Type I, Heterotic SO(32) and Heterotic E8 √ó E8. They predict the spacetime
dimension in which they live to be ten. This means that the six dimensions must
be compactiÔ¨Åed on an internal manifold with the size of Planck lenght.
String
theories are related via dualities. T-duality implies that in many cases two diÔ¨Äerent
geometries for the extra dimensions are physically equivalent. It relates the two
Type II and the two Heterotic theories. Therefeore the Type IIA and Type IIB
theories (also the two Heterotic theories) should be regarded as a single theory. The
S-duality relates the string coupling constant to its inverse. This duality connects
the Type I theory to the SO(32) Heterotic string theory and the Type IIB theory
to itself. Thus knowing the behaviour of these theories at small coupling limit, we
learn how they behave at strong coupling limit. This means that we know how Type
I, Type IIB and Heterotic SO(32) theories behave at strong coupling limit. At this
limit in the Type IIA and Heterotic E8 √óE8 theories arises an eleventh dimension of
size g‚Ñì(‚Ñìis the string length, g is the coupling constant). This dimension is a circle
in the Type IIA case and a line interval in the Heterotic theory. When it is large
a new type of quantum theory in eleven dimensions arises. This is called M-theoy.
The low energy limit of this theory is 11-dimensional supergravity.
271

Besides that string theories are related to each other, they are related also to
gauge theories via gauge theory/string theory duality.
This important discovery
was made in the late 1990s [2], which gives a duality between conformally invariant
quantum Ô¨Åeld theories (CFT) and superstring theories or M-theory in special space-
time geometries. A collection of coincident branes produces a spacetime geometry
with a horizon. In the vicinity of the horizon, this geometry can be approximated by
an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space times a sphere. Gauge theory/String theory duality
states that string theory or M-theory in the near-horizon geometry of a collection of
coincident D-branes or M-branes is equivalent to the low energy worldvolume theory
of the corresponding branes, which is a conformal Ô¨Åeld theory. This duality is also
called AdS/CFT duality. In the duality when one description is weakly coupled, the
dual descripiton is strongly coupled. Using an information in the weakly coupled
theory allows to learn non trivial facts about strongly coupled dual theory. There are
three basic examples of AdS/CFT duality. They all have maximal supersymmetry
(32 supercharges). The three basic examples are the following:
‚Ä¢ Superconformal Ô¨Åeld theory on the worldvolume of N parallel D3-branes cor-
responds to the type IIB theory on AdS5 √ó S5.
‚Ä¢ M-theory on AdS7√óS4 is dual to superconformal Ô¨Åeld theory on N M5-branes.
‚Ä¢ M-theory on AdS4 √óS7 corresponds to superconformal Ô¨Åeld theory which lives
on the worldvolume of N parallel M2-branes.
In each case the sphere surrounds the branes. Each of these branes has one unit of the
appropriate type of charge. Thus, the background has nonvanishing antisymmetric
tensor gauge Ô¨Åeld with N units of Ô¨Çux. Gauss‚Äôs law requires that these Ô¨Çuxes pass
through the sphere.
2. Aspects of AdS4 √ó S7
A stack of M2-branes has AdS4 √ó S7 near-horizon geometry.
M-theory on
AdS4 √ó S7 is dual to three dimensional superconformal Ô¨Åeld theory. M-theory does
not contain a dilaton Ô¨Åeld, which means that there is no weak-coupling limit. Hence
the dual Ô¨Åeld theory is strongly coupled and as a result does not need to have a clas-
sical Lagrangian descripiton. One can think about this three dimensional conformal
Ô¨Åeld theory in the following way. Remember that the low energy eÔ¨Äective theory
on the world-volume of N coincident D2-branes of type IIA superstring theory is a
maximally supersymmetric three dimensional Yang- Mills theory with gauge group
U(N). Yang-Mills coupling in three dimensions is dimensionful and introduces a
scale. This means this theory is not conformal. From the other side type IIA cou-
pling constant is proportional to the radius of a circle on which eleventh dimension
is compactiÔ¨Åed. When this coupling constant becomes large the gauge theory cou-
pling constant also increases. This corresponds to going to the infrared in the gauge
theory. Also the circular eleventh dimension is increasing. In the limit where the
272

coupling constant becomes inÔ¨Ånite one reaches the conformally invariant Ô¨Åxed-point
theory describing a stack of coincident M2-branes in 11 dimensions. This theory
has SO(8) R-symmetry which corresponds to the rotations in the eight dimensions
transverse to the M2-branes in 11 dimensions. The isometry group of AdS4 √ó S7
metric is SO(3, 2)√óSO(8) ‚âàSp(4)√óSpin(8). SO(3, 2) is the symmetry of AdS4 and
in the dual theory it corresponds to the conformal symmetry group. The isometry
group SO(8) of S7 corresponds to the R-symmetry of the dual gauge theory. There
are 32 conserved supercharges (maximal supersymmetry). In the dual gauge theory
16 of these supersymmetries are realized linearly and the other 16 are conformal
supersymmetries. The isometry superalgebra becomes OSp(8|4) once these super-
symmetries are included.
The 32 fermionic generators transform as (8, 4) under
Spin(8) √ó Sp(4).
The ABJM model:
Aharony, Bergman, JaÔ¨Äeris and Maldacena have conjec-
tured that 11-d supergravity on AdS4 √ó S7/Zk, corresponding to the near horizon
geometry of N M2-branes at a C4/Zk singularity, be dual to N = 6 Chern-Simons
(CS) theory in d = 3 with gauge group U(N)k √óU(N)‚àík and opposite CS couplings
k1 = k = ‚àík2 [5]. The metric reads
ds2
11 = 1
4L2ds2
AdS + L2ds2
S7
(1)
for later use, note that LAdS = L/2 with L the radius of S7 and henceforth the
metrics of the subspaces are for unit curvature radii.
The Type IIA solution which corresponds to the ABJM model reads
ds2
IIA = 4 œÅ2
L2 dx ¬∑ dx + 4 L2
4œÅ2 dœÅ2 + L2ds2
CP3 = 1
4L2ds2
AdS + L2ds2
CP3
(2)
where L =
¬≥
32œÄ2N
k
¬¥1/4
is the curvature radius in string units. The string coupling,
related to the VEV of the dilaton, is given by gs = L/k =
¬≥
32œÄ2N
k5
¬¥1/4
. Thus the
perturbative Type IIA description should be valid for L >> 1 and gs << 1 i.e. for
N1/5 << k << N. Œª = N/k is the ‚Äôt Hooft coupling of the boundary CS theory.
When one goes from Type IIA on AdS4√óCP3 to M-theory on AdS4√óS7 an uplift
to 11 dimensions occur, the CP3 becomes the base of a Hopf Ô¨Åbration S7 = CP3‚ãâS1
whose metric reads
ds2
S7 = ds2
CP3 + (dœÑ + A)2
(3)
with dA = 2JCP3, the K¬®ahler form on CP3 normalized so that dV (CP3) = J ‚àßJ ‚àß
J /6 and V (CP3) = œÄ3/6. There are R-R Ô¨Çuxes
gsF2 = 2LJ
,
gsF4 = 6L3dV (AdS4)
,
gsF6 = 6L5dV (CP3).
(4)
In the ABJM model B2 = 0. When there are also fractional M2-branes one
has the ABJ model. In that case the boundary theory is N = 6 CS theory with
273

U(N)k √ó U(N + k ‚àíl)‚àík gauge group [6]. In this model B2 = J l/k, with l =
1, ..., k ‚àí1.
The 11-d supergravity approximation should be valid in the double-scaling limit
k ‚Üí‚àû, N ‚Üí‚àûwith Œª = N/k Ô¨Åxed and large. The CFT description should instead
be valid when Œª << 1, i.e. k >> N. As Œª ‚Üí0 higher spin symmetry enhancement
takes place [3], [4].
N = 6 d = 3 boundary CS theory:
Three dimensional N = 6 CS theories are
constructed from CS theories with N = 3 supersymmetry. These N = 3 theories
come from the N = 4 case in three dimensions which in turn are obtained from
N = 2 in d = 3. d = 3 theories with N = 2 supersymmetry are the dimensional
reductions of N = 1 theories in four dimensions. The chain connecting these theories
is the following:
N = 6(d=3) ‚ÜêN = 3(d=3) ‚ÜêN = 4(d=3) ‚ÜêN = 2(d=3) ‚ÜêN = 1(d=4)
(5)
The Ô¨Åeld contents of the theories are the following:
d = 4, N = 1
VN=1 = (A¬µ, œá, D) ‚ààAdj
Qi = (œÜi, œài) ‚ààRi
d = 3, N = 2
VN=2 = (Am, œá, D, œÉ) ‚ààAdj
Qi = (œÜi, œài) ‚ààRi
(6)
d = 3, N = 4
VN=4 = VN=2 + Œ¶ ‚ààAdj
Qi ‚ààRi, ÀúQi ‚àà¬ØRi
The vector multiplet of N = 4 theory consists of an N = 2 vector multiplet
plus one chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation Œ¶ = Œ¶ata and there are
hypermultiplets Q and ÀúQ in the real (reducible) representations.
Adding to the
N = 4 superpotential W = ÀúQŒ¶Q the CS term, giving a mass m = g2
Y M
k
4œÄ to
the vectors, and a CS superpotential W = ‚àík
8œÄTrŒ¶2 breaks N = 4 to N = 3.
Integrating out Œ¶ yields the superpotential
W = 4œÄ
k ( ÀúQtaQ)( ÀúQtaQ).
(7)
The resulting N = 3 theory has SO(3) ‚âàSU(2) R-symmetry group.
The case of N = 6 is special. It comes from thex N = 3 theory when one takes
the guage group to be G = U(N)k √ó U(N)‚àík and and 2 hypermultiplets in the
bifundamental representation Hi = Qi + ÀúQi, i = 1, 2. The chiral superÔ¨Åels Qi =
(A1, A2) are in the bifundamental representation (N, N‚àó) and ÀúQi = (B1, B2) are in
the anti- bifundamental representation (N‚àó, N). In this case the superpotential (7)
becomes:
W = 2œÄ
k tr(AiBiAjBj ‚àíBiAiBjAj) = 4œÄ
k tr(A1B1A2B2 ‚àíA1B2A2B1).
(8)
This can be written in a more compact way:
W = 2œÄ
k œµabœµÀôaÀôbtr(AaBÀôaAbBÀôb).
(9)
274

The N = 3 CS theory has a SU(2) √ó U(1) Ô¨Çavour symmetry. This SU(2) rotates
A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs together. (9) has a symmetry under SU(2)√óSU(2)√óU(1)B which acts
on A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs separately. This symmetry does not commute with R-symmetry
SO(3) ‚âàSU(2) under which A and B form doublets. Hence the N = 3 CS theory
in this speciÔ¨Åc case has a larger SU(4) ‚âàSO(6) symmetry. This is the R-symmetry
group of N = 6.
CompactiÔ¨Åcation on S7:
For the later use let us brieÔ¨Çy review the mass spec-
trum of the Freund-Rubin solution of d = 11 supergravity on S7 [8‚Äì10]. The grav-
itino Ô¨Åeld as well as all the fermions are set to zero, the AdS4 Riemann tensor and
the three-form Ô¨Åeld strength are given by:
R¬µŒΩœÅœÉ = ‚àí4(g¬µœÅ(x)gŒΩœÉ(x) ‚àíg¬µœÉ(x)gŒΩœÅ(x))
(10)
F¬µŒΩœÅœÉ = 3
‚àö
2
q
‚àídet g¬µŒΩ(x)Œµ¬µŒΩœÅœÉ
(11)
where Œµ0123 = ‚àí1. The metric and the three form Ô¨Åeld with mixed indices vanish:
g¬µŒ± = F¬µŒΩœÅŒ± = F¬µŒΩŒ±Œ≤ = F¬µŒ±Œ≤Œ≥ = 0
(12)
and also
FŒ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥(y) = 0
(13)
RŒ±Œ≤ = ‚àí6gŒ±Œ≤(y)
(14)
¬µ, ŒΩ, œÅ = 0, ..., 3 are d = 4 indices, Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ = 1, ..., 7 are internal indices.
Then one considers Ô¨Çuctuations around the Freund-Rubin solution.
The lin-
earized Ô¨Åeld equations are obtained by replacing the background Ô¨Åelds in the d = 11
Ô¨Åeld equations by background Ô¨Åelds plus arbitrary Ô¨Çuctuations. An elegant and quite
general method to determine the complete mass spectrum on any coset manifold re-
lies on generalized harmonic expansion. In our case, one expands the Ô¨Çuctuations in
a complete set of spherical harmonics of S7 = SO(8)/SO(7). The coeÔ¨Écient func-
tions of the spherical harmonics correspond to the physical Ô¨Åelds in d = 4. In order
to diagonalize the linearized equations it turns out to be convenient to parameterize
the Ô¨Çuctuations as follows:
g¬µŒΩ(x, y) = g¬µŒΩ(x) + h¬µŒΩ(x, y)
(15)
h¬µŒΩ(x, y) = h‚Ä≤
¬µŒΩ(x, y) ‚àí1
2g¬µŒΩ(x)h Œ±
Œ± (x, y)
(16)
gŒ±Œ≤(x, y) = gŒ±Œ≤(x) + hŒ±Œ≤(x, y)
(17)
g¬µŒ±(x, y) = h¬µŒ±(x, y)
(18)
A¬µŒΩœÅ(x, y) = A¬µŒΩœÅ(x) + a¬µŒΩœÅ(x, y)
(19)
In particular the Weyl rescaled spacetime metric appears in (16) so as to put the

third rank totally antisymmetric representation of SO(7) with dimension 35, while
Y N27
(Œ±Œ≤) is in the symmetric traceless 27-dimensional representation. Derivatives of Y ‚Äôs
appear in the expansions since any tensor can be decomposed into its transverse
and longitudinal parts. Then one has to Ô¨Åx all local symmeties and substitute the
resulting expansions into the d = 11 Ô¨Åeld equations. The coeÔ¨Écients of each inde-
pendent spherical harmonic will yield the d = 4 Ô¨Åeld equations. After diagonalizing
the bosonic Ô¨Åeld equations one obtains the mass spectrum summarized in Table 1.
The resulting bosonic spectrum includes the massless graviton, 28 massless vectors
of SO(8), corresponding to a combination of B¬µ (in h¬µŒ±) and C¬µ (in A¬µŒΩŒ±), 35v
scalars (‚àÜ= 1) and 35s (‚àÜ= 2) pseudoscalars with (MLAdS)2 = ‚àí2.
In the
supergravity literature [8‚Äì10] masses of scalars are often shifted by ‚àíR/6 so that
(MLAdS)2 ‚Üí( Àú

Table 2: Fermionic KK towers after compactiÔ¨Åcation on S7
pergravity multiplet are massless in the sense that ( Àú
MLAdS)2 = 0. Moreover, there
are three families of scalars and two families of pseudoscalar excitations. Three of
them (0+
2 , 0+
3 and 0‚àí
2 ) contain only states with positive mass square and correspond
to irrelevant operators in the dual CFT. The remaining families 0+
1 and 0‚àí
1 contain
states with positive, zero and negative mass squared corresponding to irrelevant,
marginal and relevant operators, respectively.
A similar analysis can be performed for fermionic Ô¨Çuctuations. In Table 2 we
summarize the fermionic mass spectrum.
The KK spectrum does not include the states with ‚àófor ‚Ñì= ‚àí1, since they
do not propagate in the bulk but live on the conformal boundary of AdS4. They
correspond to the singleton representation of Osp(8|4) that consists of 8v bosons Xi
with ‚àÜ= 1
2, (ML)2 = ‚àí5
4 and 8c fermions œà Àôa with ‚àÜ= 1, ML = 1
2, both at the
unitary bound.
3. From S7 to S7/Zk and CP3 ‚ãâS1
S7 is a U(1) bundle over CP3. The CP3 solution of the d = 10 theory can be
obtained from the S7 solution of the d = 11 theory by Hopf Ô¨Åbration, i.e. keeping
only U(1) invariant states [7]. The compactiÔ¨Åcation on CP3 of the d = 10 theory
yields a four dimensional theory with N = 6 supersymmetry and with gauge group
SO(6) √ó SO(2). In order to decompose KK harmonics on S7 = SO(8)/SO(7) into
KK harmonics on CP3 = U(4)/U(3) √ó U(1), we constructed an arbitrary represen-
tations of SO(8) in the space of polynomials of 12 variables. The latter are the
coordinates of the subgroup ZSO(8)
+
generated by the raising operators of SO(8).
Then we developed a technique which allows to identify which of the above polyno-
mials correspond to highest weight states of representations of U(4) ‚äÇSO(8). In
this case the number of variables reduces to 6 and in this case the polynomials will
depend on these six variables. The method we used is quite standard in represen-
tation theory of Lie groups (see e.g. Chapter 16 of [11]). The details can be found
in the original paper [3] or in the [4]. We just give the indicator system one has to
277

solve for the highest weight states:
(a23‚àÇa13 + a24‚àÇa14)‚Ñì1+1 f(a) = 0
(a13‚àÇa12 + a34‚àÇa24)‚Ñì2+1 f(a) = 0
(a14‚àÇa13 + a24‚àÇa23)‚Ñì3+1 f(a) = 0
(‚àÇa34)‚Ñì4+1 f(a) = 0.
(21)
Solving these equations one can fully decompose KK harmonics on S7 into KK
harmonics of CP3 √ó S1 which is our next task.
In the following we will give only a couple of examples how KK towers of S7
decompose into KK towers of S7/Zk. For the decomposition of all towers see [3], [4].
For scalar spherical harmonics with Dynkin labels (‚Ñì, 0, 0, 0) one Ô¨Ånds as independent
polynomials {am
14 | m = 0, ..., ‚Ñì}. Thus the following decomposition holds:
(‚Ñì, 0, 0, 0) ‚Üí‚äï[0, ‚Ñì‚àím, m]‚Ñì‚àí2m
(22)
where the subscript is the SO(2) charge Q of the appropriate representation.
For vector spherical harmonics with SO(8) Dynkin labels (‚Ñì‚àí2, 1, 0, 0) one gets
{a12am
14, a24am
14, (a13a24 ‚àía14a23)am
14, am
14 | m = 0, ..., ‚Ñì} as independent polynomials.
The SO(8) representation decomposes into SO(6) representations as:
(‚Ñì, 1, 0, 0) ‚Üí
‚äï[0, ‚Ñì‚àím, m]‚Ñì‚àí2m ‚äï[0, ‚Ñì‚àím + 1, m + 1]‚Ñì‚àí2m
‚äï[1, ‚Ñì‚àím, m]‚Ñì‚àí2m‚àí2 ‚äï[1, ‚Ñì‚àím, m]‚Ñì‚àí2m+2
(23)
The zero charge spectrum i.e. the states which constitute the KK spectrum of Type
IIA supergravity on CP3 can be easily identiÔ¨Åed in the decompositions.
The Zk orbifold projection on S7 gives S7/Zk ‚âàCP3 ‚ãâS1. In this way the
supersymmetry breaks. It appears not to be spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
Massless scalars, corresponding to marginal operators with ‚àÜ= 3 on the boundary,
only appear in higher KK multiplets, i.e. in the 840vc = (2, 0, 2, 0) and 1386 =
(6, 0, 0, 0).
None of these can play the role of St¬®uckelberg Ô¨Åeld for the 12 coset
vectors in the 6+2 + 6‚àí2 of SO(8)/SO(6) √ó SO(2).
Indeed, using the group theory techniques described in Section 3 the decompo-
sition of 840vc = (2, 0, 2, 0) under SO(8) ‚ÜíSO(6) √ó SO(2) reads
840vc(2, 0, 2, 0) ‚Üí
84+4[0, 2, 2] + 70+2[0, 3, 1] + 70+2[0, 1, 3] + 64+2[1, 1, 1]
+840[0, 2, 2] + 450[1, 2, 0] + 450[1, 0, 2]
(24)
+350[0, 4, 0] + 350[0, 0, 4] + 20‚Ä≤
0[2, 0, 0]
+84‚àí4[0, 2, 2] + 70‚àí2[0, 3, 1] + 70‚àí2[0, 1, 3] + 64‚àí2[1, 1, 1]
This means that the massless scalars in the 840vc(2, 0, 2, 0) cannot account for the
needed St¬®uckelberg Ô¨Åelds in the 6+2 + 6‚àí2.
One can recognize massless scalars
neutral under SO(2) that survive in k ‚Üí‚àûlimit and transform non-trivially under
SO(6).
278

The same applies to the other massless scalars in the 1386(6, 0, 0, 0). The de-
composition reads
1386(6, 0, 0, 0) ‚Üí
84+6[0, 6, 0] + 189+4[0, 5, 1] + 270+2[0, 4, 2]
+3000[0, 3, 3]
+84‚àí6[0, 0, 6] + 189‚àí4[0, 1, 5] + 270‚àí2[0, 2, 4]
(25)
It is obvious that there are no 6+2 + 6‚àí2. In this case, neutral Ô¨Åelds appear in the
300 representation of SO(6). Thus, we see that there is no Higgs mechanism for
the breaking of SO(8) to SO(6) √ó SO(2).
One observes that in the large k limit only SO(2) singlets survive. Only states
with ‚Ñìeven on S7 give rise to neutral states. This means that the parent theory could
be either a compactiÔ¨Åcation on S7 or on RP7 = S7/Z2. Indeed both lead to SO(8)
gauged supergravity with the massless multiplet {g¬µŒΩ, 8œà¬µ, 28A¬µ, 56Œª, 35+ + 35‚àíœï}.
4. KK towers
Let us now focus on the KK excitations. One can write the single-particle par-
tition function on S7, decompose it into super-characters and identify the SO(2)
charge sectors, relevant for the subsequent Zk projection i.e. compactiÔ¨Åcation on
CP3.
Introducing a chemical potential for the charge Q (tQ), the super-character of
an ultra-short 1/2 BPS representation of Osp(8|4) reads:
X 1/2BPS

.
For ‚Ñì= 0, corresponding to the gauged supergravity multiplet, there is further
shortening (null descendants) due to the presence of conserved ‚Äòcurrents‚Äô i.e. stress-
tensor, SO(8) vector currents and 8s supercurrents. Taking this into account one
279

Ô¨Ånds the following super-character
X 1/2BPS
‚Ñì=0
(q) =
1
(1 ‚àíq2)3
[(10t2 + 15 + 10t‚àí2)q2 ‚àí
2(15t2 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 15t‚àí2)q3 +
(10t2 + 15 + 10t‚àí2 + 3(6t2 + 15 + 1 + 6t‚àí2))q4 ‚àí
4(t2 + 6 + t‚àí2)q5 ‚àí(6t2 + 15 + 1 ‚àí5 + 6t‚àí2)q6 +
2(t2 + 6 + t‚àí2)q7 ‚àí3q8].
(27)
The denominator takes into account derivatives (descendants). Quite remarkably
this formula coincides with the previous one when ‚Ñì= 0.
After some algebra, putting t = 1 (i.e. not keeping the track of SO(2) charge),
one Ô¨Ånds
X 1/2BPS
‚Ñì=0
(q) = q2(3q3 ‚àí7q2 ‚àí7q + 35)
(1 + q)3
.
(28)
A factor (1 ‚àíq)2 cancels between numerator and denominator meaning that not
only the number of bosons equals to the number of fermions and the sum with ‚àÜ1
vanishes but also the sum with ‚àÜ2 should vanish. This should be related to the
absence of quantum corrections to the negative vacuum energy, i.e. cosmological
constant in the bulk.
The 1/2 BPS partition function is given by
ZN=8
1/2BPS =
X
‚Ñì
X 1/2BPS
‚Ñì
=
35q2
(1 ‚àíq2)2 .
(29)
The simplicity of the result is due to miraculous cancellations between bosonic and
fermionic operators with the same scaling dimensions in diÔ¨Äerent KK multiplets
i.e. with diÔ¨Äerent ‚Ñì‚Äôs.
In order to perform the Zk projection it is useful to decompose into SO(2) charge
sectors according to
ZN=8‚ÜíN=6
1/2BPS
(q, t) = q2[(1 + q6)P2(t) ‚àí(q + q5)P3(t) + (q2 + q4)P4(t) ‚àíq3P5(t)]
(1 ‚àíqt)4(1 ‚àíqt‚àí1)4(1 + q)2
,
(30)
where
P2(t) = 10t+2 + 15 + 10t‚àí2
P3(t) = 20t+3 + 10t+2 + 64t+1 + 22 + 64t‚àí1 + 10t‚àí2 + 20t‚àí3
P4(t) = 15t+4 + 8t+3 + 104t+2 + 48t+1 + 175 + 48t‚àí1 + 104t‚àí2 + 8t‚àí3 + 15t‚àí4
P5(t) = 4t+5 + 2t+4 + 64t+3 + 40t+2 + 196t+1 + 88 +
+196t‚àí1 + 40t‚àí2 + 64t‚àí3 + 2t‚àí4 + 4t‚àí5.
(31)
Depending on the choice of k one can recognize the surviving 1/2 BPS states
as those with Q = kn. In formulae one has to replace t with œâr and sum over
r = 0, ..., k ‚àí1.
280

5. Conclusions
We have re-analyzed the KK spectrum of 11 dimensional supergravity on AdS4√ó
S7 which is the low energy limit of M-theory on AdS4 √ó S7. A compactiÔ¨Åcation on
AdS4√óS7/Zk with k ‚Üí‚àûcorresponds to the low energy limit of Type IIA theory on
AdS4 √ó CP3. We presented group theoretical method showing how the R-symmetry
group of the theory on AdS4 √ó CP3 is embedded into the R-symmetry group of the
theory on AdS4 √ó S7. This gives a very nice way to decompose the KK towers of
S7 into those of S7/Zk. Going from M-theory on AdS4 √ó S7 to Type IIA theory
on AdS4 √ó CP3 the supersymmetry breaks.
We show that this breaking is not
spontaneous. Massless scalars, corresponding to marginal operators with ‚àÜ= 3 on
the boundary, only appear in higher KK multiplets, i.e. in the 840vc = (2, 0, 2, 0)
and 1386 = (6, 0, 0, 0). We have shown that none of these can play the role of
St¬®uckelberg Ô¨Åeld for the 12 coset vectors in the 6+2 +6‚àí2 of SO(8)/SO(6)√óSO(2).
In the last section we discussed KK excitations in details computing diÔ¨Äerent super-
characters and partition functions.

Casimir-Polder forces in the geometry of cosmic string
A. S. Kotanjyan, A. A. Saharian, V. M. Bardeghyan
Department of Physics, Yerevan State University

Abstract
Combined eÔ¨Äects on the Casimir-Polder potential due to a cosmic string
and coaxial metallic cylindrical shell are investigated.
For the both regions
inside and outside the shell, the potential is decomposed into pure string and
shell-induced parts. In a special case of an isotropic polarizability tensor, the
Casimir-Polder force in the interior region is attractive with respect to the shell.
In the exterior region the force is attractive near the shell and repulsive at large
distances from the shell.
1. Introduction
The Casimir-Polder (CP) forces have attracted a great deal of attention because
of their important role in many areas of science, including material sciences, physical
chemistry, nanotechnology, and atom optics (for reviews see Refs. [1, 2]). In this
paper we present the results of the investigation of the CP forces due to the non-
trivial topology induced by a straight cosmic string and boundaries. Cosmic strings
are among the most interesting classes of topological defects which could arise as a
result of symmetry breaking phase transitions during the evolution of the early uni-
verse [3]. They are candidates for the generation of a variety of interesting physical
eÔ¨Äects, including gravitational lensing, anisotropies in the cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation, the generation of gravitational waves, high-energy cosmic rays,
and gamma ray bursts.
The nontrivial topology of the cosmic string spacetime results in the distortion
of the zero-point vacuum Ô¨Çuctuations of quantized Ô¨Åelds and induces non-zero vac-
uum expectation values for physical observables. Combined eÔ¨Äects of topology and
boundaries on the quantum vacuum in the geometry of a cosmic string have been
investigated for scalar [4], vector [5, 6] and fermionic Ô¨Åelds [7, 8], with boundary con-
ditions on cylindrical surfaces. The vacuum energy for massless scalar Ô¨Åelds subject
to Dirichlet, Neumann and hybrid boundary conditions in the setting of the conical
piston has been analyzed in Ref. [9]. The vacuum polarization eÔ¨Äects in a cosmic
string spacetime induced by a scalar Ô¨Åeld obeying Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions on a Ô¨Çat boundary orthogonal to the string are considered in Ref. [10].
Here we consider the eÔ¨Äects of cosmic string and coaxial metallic cylindrical shell on
283

the CP force. The CP interaction potential of a microparticle with an ideal metal
cylindrical shell in background of Minkowski spacetime has been investigated in a
number of papers (see references in Ref. [11]). Recently, the exact potential for a
microparticle outside a cylindrical shell has been found in Ref. [11] using the Hamil-
tonian approach. The CP potential for both regions inside and outside an ideal
metal cylindrical shell is investigated in Ref. [12] using the Green function method.
The paper is based on Refs. [13, 14, 15] and is organized as follows. In the
next section the CP potential is investigated for a polarizable microparticle in a
boundary-free cosmic string geometry. The part in the CP potential induced by a
metallic cylindrical shell is studied in Sec. 3 for both interior and exterior regions.
The main results are summarized in Sec. 4.
2. Casimir-Polder potential in boundary-free
cosmic string geometry
For an inÔ¨Ånitely long straight cosmic string the line element has the form
ds2 = dt2 ‚àídr2 ‚àír2dœÜ2 ‚àídz2,
(1)
where 0 ‚©Ωr < ‚àû, ‚àí‚àû< z < +‚àû, 0 ‚©ΩœÜ ‚©ΩœÜ0 and the spatial points (r, œÜ, z)
and (r, œÜ + œÜ0, z) are to be identiÔ¨Åed.
For an inÔ¨Ånite straight cosmic string the
line element (1) has been derived in Ref. [16] in the weak-Ô¨Åeld approximation. In
this approximation the planar angle deÔ¨Åcit is small and it is related to the mass ¬µ0
per unit length of the string by 2œÄ ‚àíœÜ0 = 8œÄG¬µ0, with G being the gravitational
constant.
The validity of the line element (1) has been extended beyond linear
perturbation theory by several authors [17] (see also Ref.
[3]).
In this case the
planar angle deÔ¨Åcit need not to be small. An interesting limiting case with œÜ0 ‚â™2œÄ
has been discussed in Ref. [3].
First we consider the CP potential for a microparticle with the polarizability
tensor Œ±jl(œâ) in the boundary-free cosmic string geometry. For a microparticle at a
point r, the potential is given by the expression [2]
U0(r) = 1

and x = (t, r), x‚Ä≤ = (t‚Ä≤, r‚Ä≤), œÑ = t‚àít‚Ä≤. In (3), G(0)
jl (x, x‚Ä≤) is the retarded Green tensor
for the electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld in the geometry of the cosmic string and G(M)
jl (x, x‚Ä≤)
is the corresponding tensor in the Minkowski spacetime. Outside the string core
the spacetime is Ô¨Çat and the renormalization is reduced to the subtraction of the
Minkowskian part.

In the problem under consideration the oÔ¨Ä-diagonal components, G(s)
jl (r, r; iŒæ),
j Ã∏= l, vanish and for the diagonal components we have the expression:

In (24), Œ±ll(iŒæ) are the (physical) components of the polarizability tensor in the
cylindrical coordinates xl = (r, œÜ, z). These components depend on the orientation of
the polarizability tensor principal axes. As a consequence, the CP potential depends
on the distance of the microparticle from the string and on the angles determining
the orientation of the principal axes. Let us introduce Cartesian coordinates x‚Ä≤l =
285

(x‚Ä≤, y‚Ä≤, z‚Ä≤) with the z‚Ä≤-axis along the string and with the particle location at (r, 0, 0)
and let Œ≤ln be the cosine of the angle between x‚Ä≤l and the n-th principal axis of
the polarizability tensor.
One has P3
n=1 Œ≤2
ln = 1.
Now we can write Œ±ll(œâ) =
P3
n=1 Œ≤2
lnŒ±n(œâ), where Œ±n(œâ) are the principal values of the polarizability tensor.
The coeÔ¨Écients Œ≤ln can be expressed in terms of the Euler angles determining the
orientation of the principal axes with respect to the coordinate system x‚Ä≤l. In the
isotropic case Œ±n(œâ) ‚â°Œ±(œâ) and we have Œ±ll(œâ) = Œ±(œâ).

with Œ±ll(0) being the static polarizability of a particle. The force corresponding to
(11) can be either attractive or repulsive.
For an isotropic polarizability tensor, Œ±jl(œâ) = Œ¥jlŒ±(œâ), we can explicitly sum
over l and the expression for the CP potential is obtained from (9) by making the
replacement

b1(v) = b2(v) = 2v2, b3(v) = 2 ‚àí2v2.
(13)
For the further transformation of the general expression (9) for the CP poten-
tial we need to specify the functional form of the polarizability tensor.
For the
corresponding principal values we use the anisotropic oscillator model with
Œ±n(iŒæ) =

(14)
and with œâ(n)

and g(n)

being the oscillator frequencies and strengths, respectively.
This model for the dynamic polarizability works well over a wide range of separa-
tions. Now for the function (8) one gets

With dependence of the orientation of the polarizability tensor principal axes and
on the values of Œ∑(m)

The dependence of the CP potential on the orientation of the polarizability tensor
principal axes with respect to the string will also lead to the moment of force acting
on the particle. As a consequence, the inÔ¨Çuence of the cosmic string on the system
of particles with anisotropic polarizability results in the macroscopic polarization.

3. Casimir-Polder potential for a metallic cylinder in cosmic string
spacetime
In this section we consider the CP potential for a microparticle inside and outside
a metallic cylindrical shell with radius a.
The CP potential is presented in the
decomposed form (details will be presented in Ref. [15])

and the prime on the summations sign means that the term m = 0 should be
taken with the coeÔ¨Écient 1/2. In the absence of the string we have q = 1 and the
formula (24) is reduced to the expression for the CP potential for a cylindrical shell
in Minkowski spacetime derived in Ref. [12].
For the isotropic polarizability tensor the general expression (24) for the boundary-
induced part in the CP potential takes the form

potential for a metallic plate in Minkowski spacetime.

For the boundary-induced part in the CP force we have Fb = Fb,rnr, where nr is
the unit vector along the radial coordinate r and Fb,r = ‚àí‚àÇrUb(r). In the isotropic
case one has Fb,r > 0 and the boundary-induced part in the CP force inside the
cylindrical shell is directed toward the shell. The pure string part of the force has
the same direction and the total force in the isotropic case is repulsive with respect
to the string and attractive with respect to the shell.
Similar to the interior case, the CP potential for the exterior region is presented
in the decomposed form (23).
The formulas for the boundary-induced part are
obtained from expressions (24), (26) and (29) by the interchange Iqm ‚áÑKqm. At
large distances from the shell, to the leading order we Ô¨Ånd
Ub(r) ‚âà‚àí
qŒ±11(0)
6œÄr4 ln(r/a) .
(31)
At large distances the CP potential is dominated by the pure string part and the
corresponding force in the isotropic case is repulsive.
In Ô¨Ågure 1 we display the total CP potential U(r) (full curve) for both interior and
exterior regions as a function of r/a for q = 2 and a/Œª0 = 1, with Œª0 = 2œÄ/œâ0. The
dot-dashed and dashed curves correspond to the pure string (U0(r)) and boundary-
induced (Ub(r)) parts in the potential, respectively. In the numerical evaluation the
single oscillator model is used with isotropic polarizability and with the parameters
gj = g0 and œâj = œâ0. The potential is dominated by boundary-induced part near
the cylindrical shell and by the pure string part for points near the string and at
large distances from the cylindrical shell.
4. Conclusion
We have presented the results of the investigation of the CP potential for a
microparticle with anisotropic polarizability tensor in the geometry of a straight

cosmic string with coaxial metallic cylindrical shell.
For the both exterior and
interior regions of the shell the potential is decomposed into the boundary-free and
shell-induced part. The former dominates for points near the string and at large
distances from the shell, whereas the shell-induced part is dominant near the shell.
The potential depends on the distance of the microparticle from the string and on
the angles determining the orientation of the principal axes. In the anisotropic case,
with dependence of orientation, the corresponding forces can be either attractive or
repulsive. As a model for a polarizability tensor we have taken anisotropic oscillator
model which works well over a wide range of separations. Within this model, for
an isotropic polarizability tensor the boundary-free part of the CP force is repulsive
with respect to the cosmic staring for all distances and the shell-induced part is
attractive with respect to the shell.
At large distances from the shell (retarded
regime), the dominant contribution to the CP potential comes from low frequencies
and it scales as 1/r4.
At large distances from the shell, the shell-induced part
behaves as 1/[r4 ln(r/a)]. At distances from the string smaller than the relevant
transition wavelengths the potential behaves as 1/r3 power law.
In the case of
anisotropic polarizability, the dependence of the CP potential on the orientation of
the polarizability tensor principal axes will also lead to the moment of force acting
on the particle.
