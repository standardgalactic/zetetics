Abstract
At the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), a process is being developed in the ﬁeld of renewable
energies to produce synthetic natural gas (mainly methane) also known as SNG from wood
or from carbon dioxide and hydrogen the latter being generated by excess electricity from
renewable sources. The entire process chain is under investigation, with the aim of building the
complete facility on a commercial-scale. The main reactor is a catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed
(BFB) reactor, details of which were characterized in this work. In the BFB reactor, the feed gas
rises in bubble form between the loosely suspended nickel-alumina catalyst particles, which
facilitate the conversion of the feed gas into methane and water vapor. A closer examination of
the ﬂuidized bed, especially when it is equipped with vertical internals, such as heat exchanger
tubes, was necessary because of the scarcity of relevant data in the literature. Without a
detailed description of the reactor properties, a reliable design and scaling of the ﬂuidized bed
to larger dimensions would not be possible.
Several ﬂuidized beds with diameters between 5.5−22.4cm were used in this work for the
precise characterization of the BFB reactor. All of these ﬂuidized beds can be equipped with
vertical tubes that simulate the heat exchanger tubes in the real process. Porous γ-alumina
particles were used, because this material is employed as a catalyst support material in the
nickel catalyst for the methanation reaction. All experiments were carried out at ambient
temperature and pressure with compressed air. The lack of commercial alternatives for the
characterization of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds necessitated the development of a special
optical sensor before measurements with ongoing reaction could commence. This sensor
shall enable to characterize hydrodynamic properties of the ﬂuidized bed reactor during the
methanation reaction. Properties such as the bubble size, rise velocity, and quantity of rising
gas bubbles can be determined.
A detailed investigation of the hydrodynamic properties of ﬂuidized beds with and without
vertical tubes was carried out as part of research collaboration with Delft University of
Technology. A X-ray tomographic apparatus with a temporal resolution of 2500 Hz and a
theoretical spatial resolution of about 0.5 cm was used. The actual minimum bubble size is
limited to 2 cm, to avoid counting artifacts as bubbles.
The X-ray tomography measurements were quantitatively evaluated and compared to both,
literature values for ﬂuidized beds without the use of vertical tubes, and the measured
values obtained by using the custom-built optical sensors. In addition, based on the X-ray
tomography measurements, quasi three-dimensional images of the bubbles were created to
obtain an impression of the bubble shape, distribution, and size in the ﬂuidized bed. In general,
vii

Abstract
vertical tubes are considered to inhibit horizontal bubble movement and bubble coalescence,
causing the bubbles to become axially stretched and the bubble surface to become slightly
perturbed. In the presence of vertical internals, the surface-to-volume ratio of the bubbles
is signiﬁcantly larger and almost constant, as evidenced by the evaluation of the hydraulic
diameter. The vertical internals serve to increase the interfacial area between bubbles and
the dense phase (mass transfer is rate-limiting for many reactions). In addition, designing a
reactor for almost constant hydraulic bubble diameter as measured with vertical internals is
much easier. Due to the precise analysis of the X-ray data a correlation between the bubble
size and rise velocity for individual bubbles was refuted, which means that the bubble velocity
of individual bubbles in a swarm of bubbles seems not to correlate with the bubble size at a
single position. The well-known relationship between bubble size and velocity applies only to
the averaged values for different measurement positions and gas velocities as well as to single
bubbles not rising in a swarm of bubbles.
The usability of the developed optical sensors was additionally checked by means of a Monte
Carlo simulation. In particular, it was assessed how local optical measurements could be used
to make reliable statements about the performance of the entire reactor. Additionally, the
inﬂuence of the optical sensors on the hydrodynamics was examined with the aid of the X-ray
tomography equipment at the Delft University of Technology. It was found that an optical
sensor can be used without major restrictions for continuous monitoring of ﬂuidized beds,
which indicates that the presence of the sensor does not adversely affect the bubble properties
to a signiﬁcant extent.
Based on the comprehensive X-ray tomography data correlations were developed that take into
account the distribution of bubble size and rise velocity. These correlations allow to simulate
individual bubbles in a bubble swarm and to establish a link between the distributions of the
bubble size and velocity. Thus, the main bubble properties can be simulated as a function of
height, reactor size and gas velocity.
Various methods that could be used to scale the BFB reactor were analyzed in this work;
the sectoral scale-up approach developed at PSI, a method for scaling catalytic bubbling
ﬂuidized beds, was studied through several experiments with different column diameters. The
experiments culminated in the deﬁnition of different limits within which the sectoral scale-up
approach seems to yield promising results. These limits are that the bubble diameter should
not exceed 2/3 of the reactor diameter, and that at least two rows of vertical tubes should be
located between the measuring position and the outer reactor wall to avoid wall effects.
The abrasion of catalyst support materials in ﬂuidized beds was also studied. For exothermic
catalytic ﬂuidized beds, extensive particle abrasion can lead to reactor shutdown. The reason
is a possible overheating of mostly non-cooled ﬁlter units downstream from the BFB reactor,
which can lead to the destruction of the ﬁlter and, thus, to the release of noxious, very ﬁne
particle dust. Furthermore, in literature discrepancies in particle elutriation are observed,
which are often also attributed to interparticle forces, but not explained in detail. The present
work analyzes therefore different interparticle forces acting in a BFB reactor. In grounded
ﬂuidized beds, the electrostatic forces between the particles of the catalyst supports that were
selected for investigation (γ-alumina and dolomite) can be neglected with great probability.

Abstract
Van der Waals forces seem to be the main contributor to particle clustering and the adhesion
of ﬁnes to their surfaces. Based on the measurement results collected over up to 500 h for a
single experiment, a simple correlation was developed, which is able to describe the particle
attrition as a function of the gas velocity, time, and particle type.
The systematic evaluations in this thesis have resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the uncer-
tainties concerning the design and scale-up of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds. The results of
this study are not only useful for understanding large-scale methanation reactions; they also
contribute towards the understanding of catalytic ﬂuidized beds in general. Furthermore, the
extensive collection of detailed measurement data could be used for the validation of complex
computer models that attempt to simulate the characteristics of ﬂuidized beds in detail.

Zusammenfassung
Am Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) wird im Bereich erneuerbare Energien ein Prozess entwickelt,
der aus Holz bzw. Kohlendioxid und Wasserstoff, letzterer hergestellt aus erneurbarem Über-
schussstrom, synthetisches Erdgas (auch als SNG bekannt aber hauptsächlich bestehend aus
Methan) herstellt. Die gesamte Prozesskette wird untersucht mit dem Ziel, eine komplette
Anlage im kommerziellen Massstab zu errichten. Der Hauptreaktor des Prozesses ist eine kata-
lytische blasenbildende Wirbelschicht, die in dieser Arbeit genauer charakterisiert wird. In der
Wirbelschicht steigt das Eduktgas (gereinigtes Gas aus dem Holzvergaser oder Wasserstoff und
Kohlendioxid) blasenförmig zwischen den in Schwebe beﬁndenden Nickelkatalysatorpartikeln
auf. Dabei ﬁndet eine katalytische Umwandlung des Eduktgases in Methan und Wasserdampf
statt. Eine genauere Untersuchung der Wirbelschicht, insbesondere bestückt mit vertikalen
Wärmetauscherrohren, war notwendig, da in der Literatur kaum Daten verfügbar waren. Ohne
eine detaillierte Beschreibung der Reaktoreigenschaften ist eine zuverlässige Auslegung und
die Skalierung der Wirbelschicht in grössere Dimensionen jedoch nicht möglich.
Zur genauen Charakterisierung des Reaktors wurden in dieser Arbeit mehrere Wirbelschichten
mit Durchmessern zwischen 5.5−22.4cm eingesetzt. Alle Wirbelschichten konnten mit verti-
kalen Rohren ausgestattet werden, welche Wärmetauscherrohre im realen Prozess simulieren.
Als Partikel wurde poröses Aluminiumoxid eingesetzt, welches als Katalysatorträgermaterial
für den Nickelkatalysator bei der Methanisierung Verwendung ﬁndet. Alle Experimente fanden
bei Umgebungstemperatur und Druck statt; es wurde ausschliesslich Druckluft verwendet.
Aufgrund fehlender kommerzieller Alternativen zur Charakterisierung katalytischer, blasenbil-
dender Wirbelschichten wurde zuerst ein spezieller optischer Sensor entwickelt. Mit dessen
Hilfe können während der Methanisierungsreaktion die hydrodynamischen Eigenschaften des
Wirbelschichtreaktors gemessen werden. Das heisst, es können die Grösse, Geschwindigkeit
und Menge der aufsteigenden Gasblasen bestimmt werden.
Detaillierte Untersuchung der hydrodynamischen Eigenschaften von Wirbelschichten mit
und ohne vertikale Rohre wurden im Rahmen einer Forschungskooperation mit der Tech-
nischen Universität Delft durchgeführt. Es wurde ein Röntgentomographiegerät mit einer
zeitlichen Auﬂösung von 2500 Hz und einer theoretischen örtlichen Auﬂösung von ca. 0.5 cm
eingesetzt. Die tatsächliche minimale Blasengrösse ist jedoch auf 2 cm begrenzt, da sonst
Artefakte als Blasen gezählt werden könnten. Die Röntgentomographiemessungen wurden
quantitativ ausgewertet und mit Literaturwerten für Wirbelschichten ohne vertikale Rohre und
den Messwerten der selbstentwickelten optischen Sensoren verglichen. Zusätzlich wurden,
basierend auf den Röntgentomographiemesswerten, quasi dreidimensionale Bilder der Blasen

Zusammenfassung
erstellt, um einen Eindruck der Blasenform, Verteilung und Grösse in der Wirbelschicht zu
erhalten. Allgemein kann gesagt werden, dass vertikale Rohre die horizontale Blasenbewegung
und somit die Blasenkoaleszenz herabsetzen, die Blasen werden axial leicht gestreckt und
die Oberﬂäche wirkt ein wenig zerklüftet. Das Oberﬂächen- zu Volumenverhältnis der Blasen
mit vertikalen Einbauten ist deutlich grösser und nahezu konstant, was durch die Auswer-
tung des hydraulischen Durchmessers belegt wird. Damit ist mit vertikalen Einbauten die
Stoffaustauschﬂäche zwischen der Blasen- und dichten Phase grösser, was von Vorteil ist, da
der Stofftransport zwischen den Phasen für viele Reaktionen geschwindigkeitslimitierend
ist. Zusätzlich ist, durch nahezu konstante hydraulische Blasendurchmesser mit vertikalen
Einbauten, die Auslegung des Reaktors deutlich einfacher. Durch die genaue Auswertung
der Daten wurde zudem ein als allgemein gültig angenommener Zusammenhang widerlegt;
basierend auf den Messergebnissen kann man sagen, dass die Blasengeschwindigkeit von
Einzelblasen in einem Schwarm von Blasen an einer einzelnen Messhöhe nicht wie angenom-
men mit der Blasengrösse korreliert. Der bekannte Zusammenhang zwischen Blasengrösse
und Geschwindigkeit gilt nur für die gemittelten Werte von verschiedenen Messhöhen und
Gasgeschwindigkeiten.
Die Einsetzbarkeit der optischen Sensoren wurde mit Hilfe einer Monte Carlo Simulation
zusätzlich überprüft. Hierbei wurde insbesondere untersucht, wie man mit Hilfe der lokalen
optischen Messungen Aussagen über die Performance des gesamten Reaktors machen kann.
Zusätzliche wurde mit Hilfe des Röntgentomographiesetups an der Technische Universi-
tät Delft der Einﬂuss der optischen Sensoren auf die Hydrodynamik untersucht. Es wurde
festgestellt, dass ein optischer Sensor ohne grössere Einschränkungen für die permanente
Überwachung von Wirbelschichten eingesetzt werden kann; das heisst, die Blaseneigenschaf-
ten sind kaum merklich beeinﬂusst.
Basierend auf den umfassenden Röntgentomographiedaten wurden Blasenkorrelationen
entwickelt welche die Verteilung der Blasengrösse und Geschwindigkeit berücksichtigen.
Diese Korrelationen erlauben es einzelne Blasen in einem Blasenschwarm zu simulieren und
einen Zusammenhang zwischen den Verteilungen der Blasengrösse und Geschwindigkeit
herzustellen. Damit können die wichtigsten Blaseneigenschaften in Funktion der Höhe,
Reaktorgrösse und Gasgeschwindigkeit simuliert werden.
Verschiedene Methoden der Reaktorskalierung wurden in dieser Arbeit analysiert; der Sektors-
kalieransatz, eine am PSI entwickelte Methode zur Skalierung von katalytischen Wirbelschich-
ten, wurde durch Experimente in verschiedenen Grössenordnungen überprüft. Aufgrund
der umfangreichen Experimente konnten verschiedene Grenzen festgelegt werden, unter
deren Einhaltung der Sektorskalieransatz vielversprechende Ergebnisse liefert. Diese sind
z.B., dass der Blasendurchmesser 2/3 des Reaktordurchmessers nicht übersteigen darf sowie,
dass mindestens zwei Reihen vertikaler Rohre zwischen der Messposition und der äusseren
Reaktorwand liegen müssen, um Wandeinﬂüsse zu vermeiden.
Der Abrieb von Katalysatorträgermaterialien in Wirbelschichten wurde auch untersucht. Für
exotherme, katalytische Wirbelschichten kann ein grosser Partikelabrieb zum Herunterfahren
des Reaktors führen und muss betrachtet werden. Der Grund ist eine mögliche Überhitzung
des zumeist ungekühlten Filters der im Anschluss an die Wirbelschicht eingesetzt ist. Das
xii

Zusammenfassung
kann zu dessen Zerstörung und damit Freisetzung von meist gesundheitsschädlichen, sehr
feinen Partikelstäuben führen. Zusätzlich ﬁndet man in der Literatur grosse Diskrepanzen
bei Partikelaustragsuntersuchungen, welche unter anderem auf elektrostatische Kräfte zu-
rückgeführt werden, aber nicht genau erklärt sind. Die aktuelle Arbeit analysiert daher die
unterschiedlichen interpartikulären Kräfte welche in einer blasenbildenden Wirbelschicht
wirken. In einer geerdeten Wirbelschicht können elektrostatische Kräfte für die untersuchten
Aluminiumoxide- und Dolomitepartikel mit grosser Wahrscheinlichkeit vernachlässigt werden.
Van der Waalskräfte scheinen der Hauptverursacher von Partikelclustering sowie anhaften von
feinen Stäuben an den Wänden zu sein. Basierend auf mehreren Abriebsversuchen (bis zu 500
Stunden je Experiment) wurde eine einfache Korrelation entwickelt, welche den Partikelabrieb
in Funktion der Gasgeschwindigkeit, Zeit und des Partikeltyps beschreiben kann.
Durch die gezielte Vorgehensweise in dieser Arbeit sind die Unsicherheiten bei der Auslegung
und Skalierung von blasenbildenden Wirbelschichten deutlich gesunken. Die Ergebnisse
können nicht nur für die Methanisierungsreaktion, sondern allgemein für katalytische Wir-
belschichten eingesetzt werden. Durch die umfangreichen, detaillierten Messungen können
komplexe Computermodelle, welche die Eigenschaften von Wirbelschichten im Detail abzu-
bilden versuchen, validiert werden.

1 Introduction
1.1
Research area
During the last decade, the expansion of renewable forms of energy in Europe has been
extremely fast. Between 2005 and 2012 an annual increase in renewable energy production
of 6.1% was achieved, while the gross ﬁnal energy consumption decreased by about 1% per
year during the same period [66]. In 2012, 14.1% of the gross ﬁnal energy consumption in 28
countries of the European Union (EU) was supplied by renewables [65]. Worldwide, 13.5%
of the primary energy was supplied by renewable energy sources in 2012, of which biomass
constituted the largest share of 10% and the remaining share was supplied by nuclear and
fossil fuel energy [118].
The increasing contribution of solar and wind energy to renewable electricity production in
the EU, has shifted the attention to energy storage, because of the uncontrollable supply of
these forms of energy. Considering that the current installed solar capacity in Germany is
already about three times larger than that of nuclear power [28], it becomes clear that, besides
underproduction, massive overproduction can also occur. Concepts need to be applied to
compensate for the ﬂuctuating production and demand. In 2014, the electricity production
from wind and solar energy in Germany ﬂuctuated on a monthly basis between 5 and 8TW h,
on a weekly basis between 0.8 and 2.6TW h, and on a daily basis between 0.022 and 0.58TW h,
[28]. Based on these numbers, it is foreseeable that different concepts need to be applied for
short as well as for long-term storage. For 2014, the usage of renewable energy, such as wind
and solar, as base load in Germany would have required roughly 12GW installed power for
storage and 1.5TW h installed storage capacity.
Storing electricity requires it to be converted into another form of energy, usually chemical,
kinetic, or potential energy. Other possible ways of compensating for the locally ﬂuctuating
production are selling the electricity (expansion of the system boundaries), demand side
management, or using readily controllable conventional power plants for compensation. The
latter option is probably the most uneconomic possibility, because the cost and efﬁciency of
such power plants are usually optimized for full load. Efﬁcient short-term storage solutions
1

Chapter 1. Introduction
seem to be pump storage power plants, batteries, or even storage concepts such as ﬂywheels
and compressed air. A possible route for Europe could also be to make use of the hydro storage
capacities in Norway, which provides large storage capacities, but would probably require
investments in transmission to transfer the energy to these facilities.
Compared to wind and solar energy, biomass as an energy source can easily be employed as
base load energy or can even be adapted to the ﬂuctuating energy demand. Biomass combined
with the usage of alternative technologies, such as the production of synthetic natural gas
(SNG) from second-generation biomass and dry waste wood seems to be an attractive route to
provide additional storage capacities for renewable electricity. The SNG production output can
approximately be doubled when hydrogen produced from solar or wind energy is employed
together with biomass in the SNG production. Other storage concepts, which could be
considered as long-term storage options, such as underground thermal storage, often have
lower efﬁciencies. Therefore, research in the ﬁeld of electricity storage is still needed.
At the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) ways to address the conversion of second-generation biomass
into SNG and the storage of renewable electricity are investigated. Research activities at PSI
include, among others, the development of the complete process chain from dry biomass
towards grid-quality SNG (essentially methane) and the conversion of renewable electricity
and carbon dioxide into SNG, also known as the power to gas (PtG) process. The PtG process or
a combination of it with the wood to SNG process allows the storage of the renewable energy
from different sources in the existing natural gas grid. The main reactor of the process chain
is a catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed (BFB) reactor, details of which were characterized in this
work. Thereby, one of the main challenges is to transfer laboratory research results to industry.
Topics, such as costs, efﬁciency, process optimization, and scale-up are getting important,
because ultimately only proﬁtable processes can be successful.
1.2
Current stage of research in renewable SNG production
In most research projects related to SNG, the single process units are at different development
levels. A standardized method to describe the status of a process in development was
suggested by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Department
of Defense (DoD). They proposed a technology assessment model, which deﬁnes different
technology readiness levels (TRL’s) [163] to classify the different sub-projects by indicating
their development stage. TRL 1 −3 approximately indicates laboratory scale experiments
with single units, TRL 4−6 represents the transition from laboratory to pilot-scale as well as
the enhancement of the single units to enable them to perform all functions required on a
commercial-scale, and TRL 7−9 represents the transition from demo- towards commercial-
scale both in a relevant environment, which means the units are completely integrated in the
process chain.
In a technology review of Kopyscinski et al. the current stage of development of the SNG
production process were summarized for different countries, [137]. This review has been
2

slightly expanded and is subsequently presented. For the SNG production process, it is
possible to distinguish between biomass and coal based SNG production as well as between
ﬁxed bed and ﬂuidized bed methanation technologies. Coal based SNG production is and
has been investigated by different companies also on a commercial-scale. Some of the ﬁrst
attempts to investigate the larger scale conversion of coal to SNG in ﬁxed bed methanation
reactors, were made by Lurgi (ﬁrst commercial methanation plant: Great Plains Gasiﬁcation
Plant in in North Dakota [188]), Haldor Topsoe (TREMP™process) at TRL 9 [108], Continental
Oil Company and British Gas Corporation of which the methanation process at demo-scale
was at TRL 7−9 [145], British Gas Corporation (further development, yielding in the HICOM
process shown at TRL 7 −9) [63], the Linde process with an unknown TRL [158], Ralph M.
Parsons Company (RMP process, unknown TRL) [250], and Imperial Chemical Industries
(ICI/Koppers process, unknown TRL) [144]. Fluidized bed methanation on a larger scale was
ﬁrst investigated by: the Bureau of Mines in 1952 (TRL 1−3) [93], Bituminous Coal Research
Inc. in 1963 (Bi-GAs project tests in TRL 4−6) [227], Thyssengas GmbH and the University of
Karlsruhe (Comﬂux ﬂuidized bed methanation process, TRL 7−9) [74]. Again, most of this
information was summarized in more detail in a technology review [137].
More recently several commercial coal to SNG projects are realized in China, due to increasing
demand and the wish to reduce imports of natural gas. Haldor Topsoe is involved in the
Huineng project in Inner Mongolia and the Qinghua project in Xinjiang, of which the Huineng
project seems to use the TREMP™methanation technology. Several additional facilities in
TRL 7−9 either exist or are currently under construction. Johnson Matthey, in cooperation
with Davy Process Technology, is also constructing several coal to SNG plants in China, e.g.,
the Fuxin project in Liaoning, the Keqi project in Inner Mongolia, and the Xinwen Project in
Xinjiang, probably using the HICOM process [153]. In South Korea, Haldor Topsoe and the
Linde Group are constructing a commercial-scale SNG plant for POSCO [97]. In the United
States, GreatPoint Energy is developing the bluegas™methanation process. This is a once
through process: the feedstock (coal, petcoke and/or biomass), the catalyst particles, and
steam and oxygen are continuously fed into a single BFB reactor. The beauty of this approach
is that it seems to be thermally neutral. The TRL is approximately 7; however, all information
is provided on the company’s website and catalyst poisoning as well as gas upgrading could
be urgent concerns.
The ﬁrst commercial biomass to SNG project (20MW scale) was initiated in 2005 by Göteborg
Energi in Sweden, the GoBiGas project. The project partners are Metso and Repotec (gasiﬁers),
Haldor Topsoe (methanation), and Jacobs (plant design); a further scale-up is scheduled [95].
The E.On company has a similar project (Bio2G) in Sweden, which is scheduled to build-
up a commercial plant with 200MW SNG output and biomass as raw material [239]. The
Energy research center of the Netherlands (ECN) is also developing an interesting process
by combining the Milena and OLGA processes, this project has an approximate TRL of 4−6
[119]. In Germany, the PtG process is applied in the Werlte biogas plant to produce renewable
SNG on a 6MW scale. This is known as the Audi e-gas project, and the project partners are the
companies Etogas and EWE as well as the research facilities Fraunhofer IWES and the Zentrum

stage of development is TRL 9 [187].
The investigation of the wood to SNG process at PSI, which is also investigated in this thesis,
started in 2002. A simpliﬁed process ﬂow sheet of the wood to SNG process is depicted in
ﬁgure 1.1a. This process involves the gasiﬁcation of the dry woody biomass in a commercially
available gasiﬁer. The desired products of the gasiﬁcation are mainly hydrogen, methane, and
carbon monoxide. In a subsequent gas cleaning and conditioning step downstream from the
gasiﬁer, all impurities, such as ash particles, sulfur compounds, and tars (most of them catalyst
poisons) are removed to enable the catalytic methanation of the syngas. The stoichiometry of
the methanation reaction is either adjusted by the water gas shift (WGS) reaction or by adding
additional hydrogen if available. Different gas cleaning technologies [196, 198] have been
investigated, especially hot gas cleaning, which is of interest because it is thermodynamically
favorable. After the cleaning and conditioning of the gas, an exothermic catalytic methanation
reaction is performed in a BFB reactor. This reactor catalytically converts the conditioned
syngas into methane and water. The chemistry as well as the mass and heat transfer of the
reaction system has been investigated. Furthermore, detailed models of the BFB reactor as well
as of the complete process chain have been designed for process optimization and efﬁcient
scale-up. For details of the methanation process refer to [217, 135], for the reactor design
to [204] and for the process ﬂow sheet simulation to [229]. In a commercially available gas-
upgrading step, byproducts, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water, are removed from
the methane, which can be injected into the natural gas grid. The potential of biomass-derived
SNG has been analyzed by Heyne and Harvey [104].

Figure 1.2: Inﬂuence of different properties on the SNG production process and current stage
of research at PSI
The PtG process, depicted in ﬁgure 1.1b, replaces the carbon and power source. Carbon
dioxide and electricity (obtained from renewable energy sources) instead of woody biomass
are used as raw material. The idea is to convert the overproduction from renewable electricity
sources into SNG, which can be stored and distributed in the existing natural gas grid. After
the gas conditioning step, the same catalytic BFB methanation reactor and gas upgrading step
can be applied as described beforehand for the wood to SNG process. If a pollution-free and
clean carbon dioxide source could be found, the PtG process is less challenging compared to
the wood to SNG process.
The catalytic BFB methanation reactor is the most challenging component of the complete
process chain. Aspects of this BFB methanation reactor have been investigated from TRL 1−7.
In Güssing (Austria), a 1MW bubbling ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor and different gas
cleaning & conditioning technologies (upstream from the methanation stage) were tested with
real wood gas in 2008 and 2009. In 2015 a new platform will be erected at PSI, which enables
the investigation of a methanation reactor in a relevant environment. The methanation reactor
(GanyMeth) will be a 150kW multi-purpose BFB methanation reactor, which can be used at
several different operating points.
For the catalytic BFB methanation, several process and design parameters are of importance.
The different process parameters, such as temperature, pressure, but also particle size, and
bed height etc., need to be investigated, because each of these parameters inﬂuence several
chemical and mechanical properties of the BFB reactor, depicted in ﬁgure 1.2. For instance,
the temperature controls the reaction rates, conversion, yield, selectivity, and equilibrium
gas composition, but its effect on the mechanical properties is negligible. The following list
summarizes the most important process and design parameters.

Chapter 1. Introduction
• Temperature
• Pressure
• Inlet gas composition
• Superﬁcial gas velocity or ﬂuidization number
• Reactor diameter
• Reactor height
• Heat exchanger area and conﬁguration
• Bed height
• Diluation of catalyst
• Catalyst particle size and type
As can be seen in ﬁgure 1.2, the depicted chemical and mechanical properties are investigated
at PSI with several different reactor sizes, reactor types, and measurement devices from
laboratory- to demo-scale, which also means that the different process and design parameters
are studied in parallel. For instance, the reaction rates and kinetics were deﬁned in TRL 1−3
experiments, the catalyst lifetime was investigated at TRL 4−6, whereas the conversion, yield,
and selectivity were even tested at the TRL 7−9 level.
Based on ﬁgure 1.2, a new function can be deﬁned, which allows the identiﬁcation of the
next logical steps to be investigated in more detail in the context of methanation research at
PSI. The new function could be deﬁned as the "change of properties during scale-up" (no
= 1, probably no = 2, and probably yes = 3) times the "inﬂuence on reactor performance"
(small = 1, medium = 2, and large = 3) divided by the technology readiness level. This function
considers the inﬂuence of the different properties on the conversion and scale-up as well as
the current stage of the research to assess their importance. The maximum of the function
deﬁnes the most important properties to be investigated in greater detail, concluding that the
mass and heat transfer within the reactor, the particle movement, and the attrition rate seem
to be crucial to enhance the general understanding of the methanation reaction within a BFB
reactor and therewith should be analyzed at the relevant scale for process optimization as well
as for reliable upscaling to industrial-scale.

Problem description
Catalytic BFB reactors are often controlled by the mass transfer between the bubble and dense
phase [16], which also limits the methanation reaction to some extent [138]. This limitation
requires investigation to understand under which conditions the mass transfer and conversion
are optimized; in other words, understanding how these processes are affected by scale-up
and column design is crucial.
In the scope of this thesis, a more general understanding of the reactor behavior needs to be
developed. This is accomplished by studying the effect of immersed vertical internals used as
heat exchanger tubes in the BFB methanation reactor, because the vertical tubes inﬂuence
nearly all the important properties of the BFB reactor. For instance, the bubble size, which
inﬂuences the surface-to-volume ratio of the gas bubbles and therewith the time it requires for
a bubble to reach equilibrium with its surroundings, the particle movement, which inﬂuences
the temperature proﬁle and catalyst deactivation, as well as the heat and mass transfer rates.
The heat transfer between the tubes and the bed limits the maximum allowable pressure and
hence the maximum production of SNG.
The literature contains a large amount of measurement data and correlations, which is suited
to describe the hydrodynamics of bubbling ﬂuidized beds without vertical internals, see e.g.
[41, 52, 125], or with horizontal tubes e.g. [116, 131, 9]. However, data relating to BFBs with
vertical internals is comparatively scarce. Most of the published work for vertical internals
can be found in [237, 102, 221, 261, 78]. Unfortunately, the available data is unsuited to
describe or model catalytic BFBs for the production of SNG, either because a different internal
conﬁguration or different particles have been analyzed, amongst other differences.
For sufﬁcient design and reliable scale-up of such a BFB reactor, or to improve the computer
models describing it, the hydrodynamic properties (bubble size, bubble rise velocity, and
bubble hold-up) have to be analyzed in detail [208, 176, 246]. High-resolution measurement
data is needed for ﬂuidized beds with internals, to describe the bed properties in sufﬁcient
detail to validate more sophisticated computer models, such as the computational ﬂuid
dynamics (CFD) [238, 115, 117], and discrete element method (DEM) models [110, 87], or a
combination of these, such as discrete particle model (DPM), or similar techniques called
computational particle ﬂuid dynamics (CPFD) models [54, 75]. A more quantitative and
critical investigation of the hydrodynamics of the process would therefore be of great value.
For many reactions performed in ﬂuidized beds, the mechanical stability of particles is of
major importance. A comparative study of more than 20 existing entrainment correlations has
revealed discrepancies in their predicted elutriation rates of up to eight orders of magnitude
[36, 45]. Among the various reasons that have been proposed for these discrepancies, one
possibility that has been largely overlooked is the existence of electrostatic forces acting on the
particles [6]. In catalytic ﬂuidized beds in which chemical conversion is highly dependent on
the amount of ﬁnes in the bed [249] this is of particular concern. Industrial-scale production
should also consider regulatory requirements pertaining to legislation and emissions, which
7

Chapter 1. Introduction
further enhances the importance of the stability and attrition resistance of the particles
[195]. Moreover, as the elutriation of ﬁnes could inﬂuence processes downstream from the
reactor, they could ultimately lead to reactor shutdown, which is something that is usually
best avoided.
1.4
Objectives
The main objectives of this work are: to analyze, understand, and describe the hydrodynamic
properties in a BFB reactor with vertical internals. This is required for reliable scale-up and
process optimization of the BFB methanation reactor currently under investigation at PSI.
In the scope of this thesis a special optical sensor, suited for the harsh conditions (high
temperature and pressure, and abrasive media) within a catalytic BFB reactor, was developed.
This enables the local investigation of many hydrodynamic properties in a functioning BFB
methanation reactor. This is of interest because the methanation reaction leads to a 50 %
volume contraction, the inﬂuence of which shall be measured at a later stage in a pilot-scale
catalytic BFB methanation reactor (GanyMeth). In this context, a Monte Carlo simulation
was conducted to facilitate the formulation of general statements about the global reactor
hydrodynamics and performance based on the local measurement data.
X-ray tomographic measurements were conducted to provide detailed, high-resolution mea-
surement data of the different hydrodynamic properties, such as bubble size, rise velocity,
and hold-up. This information is required for the reliable scale-up of catalytic ﬂuidized bed
reactors. Especially the hydrodynamics of ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals, such as heat
exchanger tubes, are unknown and were investigated as part of the work in this thesis. Further,
based on the high-resolution measurement data, the development and validation of complex
computer models, such as CFD, DEM, DPM, and CPFD becomes possible. X-ray tomography
was also employed to study the inﬂuence of optical probes on the hydrodynamics of ﬂuidized
beds to determine whether the optical probes that were previously developed could be applied
for permanent monitoring in industrial ﬂuidized beds.
Based on the new X-ray results, a new type of correlations for the different analyzed properties
of ﬂuidized beds, such as the bubble volume, size and rise velocity were developed, which
not only include ordinary mean values, but also the distributions of the different analyzed
parameters. These correlations can for instance be applied to accommodate two-phase
models describing the methanation reaction, as well as for the validation of the more complex
models mentioned above.
The sectoral scale-up approach, which is a method developed at PSI for scaling catalytic
ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals, was also investigated in this work. Four different reactor
diameters were studied to deﬁne various conditions and limits, which need to be considered
for reliable usage of the invented scaling method.
8

1.4. Objectives
Finally, the attrition resistance of two catalyst support materials in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed
reactor was investigated. Long-term tests were conducted considering different interparticle
forces, which are assumed to trigger the large discrepancies between published entrainment
data. In addition, correlations for the attrition of the catalyst support materials were developed.
Particle elutriation is of special importance for the methanation reaction, or in a more general
sense for the exothermic catalytic reactions performed in ﬂuidized beds, because the release
of particle dust from the catalyst can lead to an uncontrolled temperature increase in the ﬁlter
downstream from the BFB reactor.

2 Fluidized bed and methanation
technology
2.1
Fluidization regimes
Since 1921, when Fritz Winkler observed ﬂuidization of particles in a crucible containing coke
particles, different types of ﬂuidized beds have been developed [224]. In a ﬂuidized bed, solid
particles are ﬂuidized (lifted and mixed) by either a liquid or a gas. In this work the focus is
on gas ﬂuidization. The gas, fed through a porous or perforated distributor plate from the
bottom of the reactor, lifts particles in a column and ﬂuidization is obtained. By increasing the
gas ﬂow, different so-called ﬂuidization regimes occur, depending on the particular ﬂuid and
particles used, see ﬁgure 2.1. In ﬁgure 2.1, the ﬂow is increased from left to right.
For small superﬁcial gas ﬂows in a bed of particles, a ﬁxed bed is maintained until the
pressure drop is sufﬁciently large to lift the ﬁrst particles. For a ﬁxed bed, the pressure drop is
roughly proportional to the superﬁcial gas velocity. The superﬁcial gas velocity, where the ﬁrst
particles are slightly lifted, is referred to as minimum ﬂuidization velocity um f . The minimum

ﬂuidization velocity is usually determined by measuring the pressure drop, or calculated by
the Ergun equation [64], see section 2.3 for more details.
Some regimes can only occur with certain particle classes, for instance smooth ﬂuidization,
also known as homogeneous or uniform ﬂuidization, is usually only obtained with a liquid, or
if Geldart A particles are employed (see section 2.4 for details about particle classiﬁcation).
In the smooth ﬂuidization regime the bed particles are slightly lifted by the gas ﬂow, without
forming larger voids in between the particles. Only the interparticle space is homogeneously
increased. For Geldart B and D particles, after the point of minimum ﬂuidization, the bubbling
regime is directly developed. In this regime, bubbles are formed above the distributor plate.
These bubbles grow, e.g., due to coalescence, and move upwards in the ﬂuidized bed leading
to intensive particle mixing.
If the gas stream is further increased in narrow ﬂuidized beds, the bubbles either keep on
growing until the onset of the slugging regime, or the regime directly turns into turbulent
ﬂuidization for sufﬁciently large bed diameters. Different correlations exist for the prediction
of the regime boundaries. For the onset of slugging, the bubble size has to reach approximately
50 −66% of the bed diameter [114, 144, 13]. For ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals and
Geldart B particles, it was also experimentally shown that the onset of slugging occurs if the
chord-length (vertical distance between surfaces of a single bubble at the pierce position)
exceeds approximately 2/3 of the inner reactor diameter [168].
The transition between bubbling or slugging and turbulent ﬂuidization can be predicted by the
help of published correlations [19, 35], or by measuring the regime boundaries with different
methods such as pressure ﬂuctuation measurements (PFM), visual observations, capacitance
or optical probes, bed expansion measurements as well as X-ray tomography. The turbulent
regime can be characterized by the existence of two different regions. In the lower sector
of the bed the solid particles form a continuous phase, whereas in the upper sector of the
bed the gas phase forms the continuum and the particles are dispersed. A comprehensive
summary how to characterize the different regimes and their boundaries is provided in a
review of [21]. For instance, the transition to the turbulent regime measured by PFM is deﬁned,

2.2. Fluidized bed types
where the standard deviation of the signal passes through a maximum [259], see ﬁgure 2.2.
Although this approach is widely accepted, the technique was also scrutinized, because the
result is dependent on the measurement equipment applied. For example, the results depend
on whether absolute or differential pressure ﬂuctuations are used, or whether the signal is
normalized [20]. Other authors noted that the maximum signal for PFM occurs when the
large bubbles begin to break up [35]. Local measurement techniques, such as capacitance
or optical probes, also permit elucidation of the ﬂow regime, e.g., by recording the local
voidage ﬂuctuations or a so-called heterogeneity index. An abrupt deviation in bed expansion
for increased gas velocity was also ascribed to the transition from bubbling to turbulent
ﬂuidization; however, this method was reported to be dependent on the applied solid return
system [21]. More recently, X-ray tomography has been utilized for the measurement of
the transition between the different regimes [211]. For these measurements, the differential
pressure ﬂuctuation measurements and X-ray results of the void length and volume were in
good agreement with the prediction of the turbulent transition velocity. The upper boundary
of the turbulent regime is reached with transport velocity.
2.2
Fluidized bed types
Fluidized beds are used for multiple processes in engineering; for instance, they are applied in
drying, coating, ﬁring, fuel production, and many catalytic reactions. Process examples are
coal gasiﬁcation or combustion, biomass pyrolysis, or catalytic processes, such as the pro-

by [121]. An overview of different technologies, designs, and layouts of ﬂuidized beds is
presented in ﬁgure 2.3. A review of the different ﬂuidized bed types can for instance be found
in [18, 255]. The present work focuses on the hydrodynamics, scale-up, and measurements in
bubbling ﬂuidized beds, which are often used for catalytic reactions.
2.3
Fluidized bed characteristics
Catalytic ﬂuidized beds generally consist of a column equipped with a gas-permeable distrib-
utor plate at the bottom. Above this permeable plate, the column is ﬁlled with several layers of
catalyst particles. Sometimes vertical or horizontal heat exchanger tubes are mounted within
the column. Usually an educt gas stream is fed through the plate at the bottom. For sufﬁciently
high gas ﬂows, the particles in the column are slightly lifted. If the gas ﬂow is further increased,
gas bubbles are formed. These gas bubbles travel upwards through the bubbling ﬂuidized bed
(BFB) reactor as though the bubble column were ﬁlled with a liquid. Interestingly, these gas
bubbles neither have a surface tension nor are their surfaces well-deﬁned.
BFB reactors are known to be specially suited for strongly exothermic reactions, due to their
high heat and mass transfer capabilities and homogeneous temperature proﬁle [144, 121].
The homogeneous temperature proﬁle is obtained through the heat capacity of the moving
catalyst particles, which helps to effectively avoid local hotspots, therewith prolonging the
catalyst lifetime [141].
The pressure drop across such a BFB column ﬁlled with particles (neglecting the pressure
drop above the distributor plate) is depicted in ﬁgure 2.4. For small gas ﬂows, the pressure
drop is roughly proportional to the superﬁcial gas velocity and is referred to as the frictional
pressure drop. It can for instance be calculated by using eq. (2.1), also known as the Ergun
equation [64]. Different forms of the Ergun equation exist and are summarized in [46]. With
14

2.3. Fluidized bed characteristics
increasing gas velocity, the point of minimum ﬂuidization is reached. The pressure drop at
this point can be calculated with the help of eq. (2.2) (gravitational pressure drop). Note, the
total pressure drop in the bubbling, slugging, and turbulent regime remains constant, due
to inversely proportional changes in the solid content per volume and the bed height. The
minimum ﬂuidization velocity can be calculated by combining eq. (2.1) and eq. (2.2), which is
a well-known dependency for ﬂuidized beds.

However, other properties of ﬂuidized beds are still unknown and have to be investigated in
more details. There remains a considerable lack of understanding and inability to accurately
predict some fundamental hydrodynamic properties. Especially in the bubbling regime,
properties such as the bubble size and shape, the rise velocity, the hold-up, the particle
movement, the heat- and mass transfer between the bubble and dense phase as well as the
residence time distribution of the gases need to be further analyzed. For catalytic BFB reactors,
these properties are of paramount importance, because e.g., the mass transfer between gas in
the bubble phase and the dense phase often limits the overall reaction rate [168].
The bubble size is often cited as one of the most important parameters for BFB technology.
Together with the shape of a bubble, its size deﬁnes the surface-to-volume ratio and is
therewith important for the interphase mass transfer. The initial bubble diameter db,0 is
mainly dependent on the distributor plate, the type of particles that are employed and the
gas ﬂow. A review of different literature correlations was published by [125]. The bubble size
correlations that are most often cited are probably [178, 201, 51, 245, 113, 107, 29, 37]. It
is important to keep in mind that all these bubble diameter correlations represent a mean
bubble diameter, while in reality a bubble size distribution exists within the bed. Often the
volume equivalent mean spherical bubble diameter dbeq is applied in the analysis, as deﬁned
in eq. (2.3). For the mass transfer calculations in this work, the hydraulic bubble diameter
dbhyd was additionally deﬁned, see eq. (2.4). Note, Vb is the bubble volume, Sb and per are the
cross-section and perimeter at the centroid of the bubble.

As can be seen in ﬁgure 2.5, the equivalent mean bubble diameter generally increases with
increasing height. Bubble growth occurs mainly due to the coalescence of bubbles, i.e. bubbles
accelerate in the wake of others and tend to move towards the center of the column with
increasing height above the distributor plate. Additionally, the hydrostatic pressure is reduced
with increasing bed height, which also increases the bubble volume [101].
The bubble growth is limited by the bubble splitting mechanism, which, especially for Geldart
A particles, leads to a maximum stable bubble diameter or equilibrium bubble size of about
0.10−0.30m. For Geldart B particles the equilibrium bubble size is in the region of 0.5−1.0m
depending on the particle size [133]. However, the maximum stable bubble diameter for
Geldart B particles is often not relevant, as smaller apparatus sizes would cause the transition
to the slugging regime before the maximum bubble diameter is reached. Two main theories
exist to describe the bubble splitting mechanism. Note that there is an ongoing discussion
about them. The "wake collapse theory" was published by [52]. They proposed that toroidal
gas circulation develops within a bubble, because of the relative velocity difference with the
surrounding particles. If the circulating velocity is larger than the bubble rise velocity, particles
are sucked up from the wake. Another theory, the "roof collapse theory", was proposed by [42].
This theory claims that bubble splitting begins at the top of the bubble and behaves similar to
a Rayleigh-Taylor type of instability, i.e., the interphase between two ﬂuids is destabilized if
the lighter ﬂuid pushes the heavier one.
The bubble rise velocity (BRV) is another important parameter in BFB reactor technology. For
instance, the BRV deﬁnes the residence time of the gas bubbles in the reactor and is therefore
also a parameter of interest. The bubble rise velocity for a single bubble rising in a bed at
minimum ﬂuidization conditions can be empirically expressed as a function of the bubble
size eq. (2.5), [52].
ub,liquid = 0.711
q
gdb
(2.5)
The mean BRV in a bubbling ﬂuidized column containing a swarm of bubbles, is often also
empirically expressed as a function of the mean bubble diameter, the minimum ﬂuidization
velocity, and the superﬁcial gas velocity eq. (2.6), [41]. Depending on components such as the
distributor plate, different multiplication factors are additionally applied. It is important to
keep in mind, that this correlation only holds for the mean bubble rise velocity, usually when
inserting the number-weighted mean equivalent bubble diameter (eq. (2.3)). For individual
bubbles in a bubble swarm the behavior is completely different, which is shown in detail in
chapter 5.

The bubble hold-up is deﬁned in eq. (2.7). The total bubble volume Vbtot in a bed can
for instance be expressed as a function of the bubble frequency fb, the volume-weighted
mean bubble volume ¯Vb, and residence time ¯τb. For optically accessible beds, the change in
bed height ∆hbed between minimum ﬂuidization and a higher gas velocity is often used to
approximate the bubble hold-up. The assumption is that the voidage between the particles
remains constant for all gas ﬂows larger or equal to the minimum ﬂuidization velocity, which
seems to be nearly true for Geldart B & D particles, [105]. For smaller powders, or higher
pressures, the density of the dense phase seems to be signiﬁcantly affected [1].

Particle classiﬁcation and dynamics
In ﬂuidization technology, particle characterization is of major importance, because the
different particle properties directly inﬂuence the ﬂuidization behavior. The most important
particle properties for ﬂuidized beds are outlined in table 2.1, in which most of the parameters
are discussed in the section 2.4, additional details of particle attrition and elutriation are
provided in sections 2.5 and 2.6. In the Handbook of Fluidization and Fluid-Particle Systems
an executive summary about particle characterization and dynamics is provided in the ﬁrst
chapter [255].

The particle size is usually stated as one of the most important particle properties when
used in ﬂuidized bed systems. However, to deﬁne a certain particle size is a non-trivial task.
Different deﬁnitions of the particle size exist and are applied in literature. Often the Sauter
mean particle diameter is used, see eq. (2.8). Other possible measures of the particle size
are the volume or surface equivalent spherical diameter. As stated by Bowen et al., particle
imaging is important when deﬁning and measuring the mean particle size and distribution,
because not every arbitrary method can be applied for every particle type and shape [24].

Usually not only a mean particle diameter is provided, but a certain particle size distribution
(PSD), which can, for instance, be obtained by a sieve analysis, microscopy combined with an
image analysis tool, or laser diffraction measurements. An extensive summary of different par-
ticle size measurement techniques and background information is provided in the following
textbooks [3, 4]. Obtaining information about the particle size forms the ﬁrst step towards the
deﬁnition of the so-called Geldart group or classiﬁcation.
The Geldart classiﬁcation is of high importance for ﬂuidization technology. Geldart [81]
categorized particles into four different classes or groups, namely Geldart A, B, C, and D
particles, see ﬁgure 2.6. Within these Geldart groups, the basic hydrodynamic properties and
the particle behavior is rather similar. The groups are deﬁned based on the difference between
the particle density and the ﬂuid density and the mean particle size. Outside the Geldart
groups, particle behavior strongly deviates from the norm, which is subsequently described in
more detail.

The ﬂuidization of group C powders (cohesive powders) is extremely difﬁcult, because gas
bypassing and channeling may happen through the development of gas cracks. The pressure
drop across the bed can be as much as half of what is expected. For Geldart C powders, the
interparticle forces usually lead to sticking and therewith improper ﬂuidization behavior. The
reason for the large interparticle forces is mainly the small particle size of the powders and
hence they enhance the relative importance of van der Waals forces compared to inertia forces.
Group A powders were intensively studied, as they are used in many commercial applications.
Interparticle forces still affect ﬂuidization and have to be considered for Geldart A powders.
Between minimum ﬂuidization and minimum bubbling gas velocity, the dense phase voidage
is signiﬁcantly increased. Further, they are well suited for pneumatic transport, and therewith
for reactor types such as circulating ﬂuidized bed (CFB). However, the positive pneumatic
transport properties may be disadvantageous and may cause particle elutriation. The heat
and mass transfer with Geldart A powders is high, probably due to frequent bubble splitting
and coalescence as well as intensive particle movement, even for small bubbles. For high
pressures, it is known that the dense phase voidage is increased and a so-called particulate
non-bubbling mode is observed. A maximum stable bubble diameter exists for Geldart A
19

Chapter 2. Fluidized bed and methanation technology
particles, see section 2.3 for details about the bubble diameter. Group B powders are usually
larger particles between 60 and 1000 µm, and even though the interparticle forces between
larger particles can be neglected, ﬁnes continue to adhere to their surfaces, which can cause
them to agglomerate with each other. Without the presence of gas bubbles, little particle
movement and circulation is observed. The exchange between the dense and bubble phase is
smaller compared to that of Geldart A particles. The maximum stable bubble diameter is larger
than for Geldart A particles, see section 2.3 for details. Group D powders are large particles
(> 500µm). The bubble rise velocity is smaller than the gas velocity in the dense phase, which
is the main difference for group D powders compared to groups A & B. Particle mixing is
relatively poor and the segregation of particles with different sizes or densities can occur
even for higher gas velocities. No maximum stable bubble diameter exists [82]. More details
about the classiﬁcation of the different particles can be found in the book Gas Fluidization
Technology [82] and in the Geldart articles [80, 81].
The mixing of particles within ﬂuidized beds can be studied by means of different technologies.
Non-invasive techniques are generally favorable. Rowe et al. were among the ﬁrst to apply
X-ray radiography [200]. They were able to demonstrate, by means of single high-resolution
X-ray images, that particles were dragged upward in the drift and wake region of bubbles.
The movement of particles in areas with a large bubble hold-up is accordingly upwards, and
downwards in other regions, e.g., close to the wall of the reactor, a phenomenon which was
conﬁrmed by other researchers [243]. However, lateral mixing occurs predominately due to
bubble eruption and circulating ﬂow [47]. Cranﬁeld et al. investigated particle mixing with
large Geldart D particles, and concluded that the main mechanism for vertical solid mixing is
bubble-induced drift, i.e., the wake can be neglected [48]. Particle motion in three-dimensional
ﬂuidized beds can for instance be visualized using radioactive marked tracer particles, with
similar physical properties. That however, requires a special environment for the preparation
of the radioactive tracers. A known and established technology is the positron emission
particle tracking (PEPT), which is also applied in ﬂuidized beds. PEPT exploits the fact that
two gamma quanta are emitted in opposite directions during the pairwise annihilation of
positrons, due to the conservation of momentum. These gamma quanta are detected in
parallel, thereby providing a clear directional reference for a single event [266]. For multiple
incidents the position of the emitter can be reliably reconstructed. The PEPT technology
enables the pathway of radioactive marked tracers to be monitored. The technology has been
reviewed by [190, 267, 146]. Another possibility for the visualization of particle pathways
might be the so-called thick gaseous electron multiplier (THGEM) technology [26]. This
detector technology seems to be relatively cheap and robust; however, again a radioactive
marked tracer is required. The mixing of particles in ﬂuidized beds was also studied by means
of differently colored particles in two- and three-dimensional beds [202]. X-ray computed
tomography was also applied for the measurement of the local mixing and segregation within
three-dimensional ﬂuidized beds with more than one material [130]; however, to the author’s

2.5. Particle attrition
knowledge, up to now it has only been possible to apply X-ray computed tomography once
the gas ﬂow is turned off.

(2.9)
Another measurable property is the particle sphericity, which can, for instance, be determined
by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images combined with an image analysis
tool. According to eq. (2.9) the projected area Ap and the perimeter of the particles have to be
determined to calculate their sphericity [33].
The internal angle of friction is a concept describing the shear strength within a granular
powder. It is a simple approximation of the coefﬁcient of friction [68]. In the literature
attempts were made to correlate the angle of response with the internal angle of friction [84].
For an approximation of the internal angle of friction the "bin-ﬂow method" can be applied
[263].
2.5
Particle attrition
Attrition in ﬂuidized beds is a process that reduces the particle size of the bed material,
and can be deﬁned as either particle abrasion or fragmentation [17, 248]. Particle abrasion
is characterized by the production of ﬁnes from the surface of a mother particle through
rounding of its edges or the chipping off loose material, causing its appearance to change from
that of broken glass to more like a grain of rice. Fragmentation, on the other hand, is when
fragments are produced by breakage of the whole particle; the mother particle dividing into at
least two fragments with little change in overall appearance. The likeliness of the occurrence
of these two attritions depends on the intensity of impact and the physical properties of the
particle, meaning that laboratory experiments need to be conducted under conditions similar
to those the particles experience in reality [255].
The attrition of fresh material in ﬂuidized beds is much higher during the ﬁrst hours of
operation; and depending on the production method, there can also be an increased ﬁnes
content in the fresh material. This is especially true in the case of brittle and milled materials,
which usually have a particle form that is far from spherical. Similarly, it is known that
crystallized pure materials can form crystals with sharp edges or elongated needle structures
that make them susceptible to generating ﬁnes. Even more spherical extruded or spray dried
materials can have a high surface roughness and can contain very weakly bound agglomerates.
Introducing fresh material to a ﬂuidized bed therefore tends to produce a high attrition and
elutriation rate due to a combination of ﬁnes initially present in the bed from production or
handling, sharp edges moving against each other, and the breakage of weak agglomerates or
crystals with defects, as also shown in section 5.1.
21

Chapter 2. Fluidized bed and methanation technology
Also the distributor plate can be a signiﬁcant cause of particle attrition, different gas distributor
systems exist, such as spargers, grid plates, slit plates, and perforated/porous plates [45].
Fluidization was initially achieved by Winkler using just a few small holes drilled into a steel
plate, a method which later became the standard attrition test for a ﬂuid catalytic cracking
(FCC) catalyst [72, 10]. However, the small holes indicate that the gas enters the system at a
speed of hundreds of meters per second (487 m s−1 in the ASTM standard test), resulting in
a very high mechanical stress on the material. Other distributor plate systems are therefore
usually constructed of porous, sintered materials that soften ﬂuidization by reducing the
speed of the gas. This lowers the internal shear generated between accelerated particles and
the rest of the bed. Bubbling ﬂuidized beds using porous sintered materials as distributor
plates typically have no jet grids, with bubbling tending to start out very homogeneous slightly
above the distributor [191]. Depending on the particle type and reactor design (e.g. internals),
these bubbles grow and rise through the bed to create particle movement and abrasion. The
presence of internals such as heat exchanger tubes can inﬂuence the movement of these gas
bubbles, and therefore also the attrition rate [168]. Bubbles erupting at the surface of the bed
can also lead to additional attrition through the collision of accelerated particles with the walls
of the ﬂuidized bed.
2.6
Particle elutriation
Fines and particles in ﬂuidized beds can become entrained in the excess gas leaving the
reactor. The easiest model for calculating the maximum size of a particle, that is certain to
be elutriated, is based on a force balance around a single particle. For smaller particles and
ﬁnes the Stokes’ law can be applied to calculate the drag force and gain an estimate of the
maximum particle size elutriated.
In practice, gas jets from erupting bubbles or gas channels in the bed can lead to much
higher local gas velocities above the bed [45] that allow larger particles to be elutriated. These
additional factors need to be considered through more complex elutriation models [77, 111,
175], with Chew et al. [36] providing a critical review of different entrainment correlations. In
the results presented in section 5.1, the most conservative assumption was used to calculate
the maximum elutriated particle size by combining Stokes’ law with the superﬁcial gas velocity
in the ﬂuidized bed.
To prevent particle elutriation, it is further important to consider the geometry above the bed;
i.e., the freeboard used to separate the particles from the gas stream. For example, increasing
the column diameter in this region reduces the gas velocity and allows particles to fall back into
the bed. This means that ﬁnes above a certain minimum size are decelerated to such an extent
that they could fall back into the reactor. Thus, the design of the freeboard can dramatically
effect elutriation, even if attrition within the bed remains unchanged [222]. Additionally,
cyclones and ﬁlters can be used to prevent ﬁnes from leaving the system [45].
22

2.7. Scale-up of ﬂuidized beds
2.7
Scale-up of ﬂuidized beds
In 1984, Glicksman derived a widely used scale-up approach for ﬂuidized beds based on the
conservation of mass and momentum in a nondimensional form [86], for both particles and
ﬂuid. The derivation of the governing equations was performed assuming an incompress-
ible ﬂuid and omitting all inter particle forces apart from collision forces. This gave seven
dimensionless groups which should be kept constant across scales:
u0ρgD
η
,
u2
0
gD ,
ρg
ρp
, D
h ,
dp
D ,φ,psd
(2.10)
The dimensionless parameters derived in eq. (2.10) are, from left to the right, the Reynolds
number, the Froude number, the gas solid density ratio, the bed geometry ratio, the ratio
between particle and bed diameter, the sphericity of the particles and the particle size
distribution. He showed for ambient air conditions, that for low Reynolds numbers and
particle diameter of about 0.2 mm, ﬂuid inertia effects can be neglected and that for higher
Reynolds numbers corresponding to particle diameters of about 2 mm, viscous effects can be
neglected. These limits are shifted with changes in gas properties, pressure and temperature.
Glicksman concluded in his work that the motion of ﬂuid and particles can be properly scaled
for ﬂuidized beds. Another well-known approach, capable to scale the hydrodynamics within
certain limitations was proposed by Horio et al. [112], however, it is automatically fulﬁlled if
Glicksman’s full set of scaling relations are applied. An extensive review of different scale-up
theories was previously published [206].
For catalytic gas conversion processes in ﬂuidized beds, conversion and yield are commonly a
function of the mass transfer, selectivity and activity of the catalyst involved. These parameters,
as well as the temperature and pressure within the reactor, are not directly taken into account
in Glicksman’s scale-up approach, and may change during scale-up. Even if for scaled
catalyst particle size (Glicksman’s approach), the selectivity and activity are the same, the
density of particles, mass transfer, temperature and pressure are usually changed, when the
dimensionless numbers are kept constant.
Horio and coworkers derived a coefﬁcient β, which helps to deﬁne whether one is in a
hydrodynamic or diffusion controlled range [112]. With the help of the coefﬁcient β, they
were able to show that for small catalyst particles the hydrodynamics has a negligible effect.
Hence, the standard equations to maintain hydrodynamic similarity are not sufﬁcient for
scaling catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds properly. This is one of the pitfalls of the Glicksman
approach when scaling catalytic ﬂuidized beds. A review about the scale-up of ﬂuidized bed
combustors claimed similar problems [147]. They proposed to divide the scale-up problem for
ﬂuidized bed combustors into three different parts: the ﬂuid dynamic scaling, the combustion
scaling and the scaling of the reactor size. For catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds with vertical
internals (i.e. heat exchanger tubes), which are investigated in the present case, the division

Figure 2.7: Hydraulic diameter calculation of squared aligned vertical internals
into isolated scaling of ﬂuid dynamic scaling, catalytic reaction scaling and scaling of the
reactor size is a challenging task and can be avoided by using the so-called sectoral scale-up
approach [206]. The sectoral scale-up approach seems to be applicable for catalytic ﬂuidized
beds with vertical internals and allows simple scale-up [207, 168].
The sectoral scale-up approach replaces the total reactor diameter in the Glicksman approach
with the hydraulic diameter of the employed internals, see ﬁgure 2.7 and eq. (2.11). Therewith,
all other properties in the Glicksman approach are scale independent. That means, properties
such as temperature, pressure, particle size, densities are kept constant across the scales,
which is of special importance for the scale-up of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds. Only the
outer reactor diameter and the open cross-sectional area within the bed is changed, which
has no inﬂuence on the hydraulic diameter of the column.

In catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds, at least three different mass transfer resistances can be
distinguished, assuming a two-phase model, ﬁgure 2.8. That are the mass transfer resistance
between bubble and dense phase, the external mass transfer around a catalyst particle and
the internal mass transfer resistance inside the catalyst particle. For bubbling ﬂuidized beds,
the mass transfer between bubble and dense phase often limits the overall reaction rate. This
is why scale-up of bubbling ﬂuidized beds is more challenging compared to other ﬂuidization
regimes, such as smooth or turbulent ﬂuidization, where only the particle external mass
transfer, the particle internal mass transfer and/or chemistry control the rate of reaction. In
eq. (2.12), the overall mass transfer coefﬁcient from the bubble to the dense phase is depicted
as sum of a convective and diffusive mass transfer term [220]. It is assumed that the mean BRV
is larger than the gas velocity in the dense phase, because all measurements were conducted
with Geldart B particles. Similar mass transfer correlations, however neglecting the convective

As can be seen in case of eq. (2.12), the convective mass transfer term is a function of the
minimum ﬂuidization velocity, which is usually experimentally determined by measuring e.g.
the pressure drop. The minimum ﬂuidization velocity can also be derived from the well-known
Ergun equation [64], however one has to ensure the correct form of the equation is chosen. A
review containing different correlations was published by Couderc [46]. Both, the minimum
ﬂuidization velocity and therefore the mass transfer coefﬁcient are depending on the particle
size and are changed during scale-up with Glicksman criteria, eq. (2.10).
Also the diffusive term in eq. (2.12) is a function of the mean bubble diameter and velocity,
which depend on the bed material used. When different bubble size correlations are analyzed,
several show a direct dependence of the predicted bubble sizes on the particle diameter
[128, 189, 257]; and nearly all show an indirect dependency on the particle diameter via the
minimum ﬂuidization velocity. That means, when Glicksman’s full set of scaling law is applied
for scaling and different correlations are used to calculate the predicted mass transfer between
bubble and dense phase, the predictions for the mass transfer are not independent from the
applied correlations, which should however be the case. A similar problem with scale-up can
be observed, when the external mass transfer coefﬁcient around a catalyst particle is analyzed.
The external mass transfer coefﬁcient in ﬂuidized beds can e.g. be calculated according to
eq. (2.13), derived from numerous published mass transfer measurements [58].

(2.13)
This mass transfer correlation (eq. (2.13)) is a function of the particle Reynolds number, the
superﬁcial gas velocity, the void fraction and the Schmidt number. Again, the mass transfer is
changed during scale-up with the Glicksman approach and the changes differ, when different
mass transfer correlations are employed. The beauty of the sectoral scale-up approach, which

speciﬁc case
replaces the reactor diameter with the hydraulic diameter of the internals, is that the mass
transfer is not affected at all.
An example for Glicksman’s full set of scale-up criteria is given in ﬁgure 2.9: the normalized
mass transfer coefﬁcient between bubble and dense phase, as well as the normalized external
mass transfer coefﬁcient around a catalyst particle, are plotted as function of the particle
diameter. For the calculations, hydrogen gas at a constant temperature of 25 ◦C was chosen;
the dynamic viscosity is roughly 8.8×10−6 Pa s and approximately pressure independent. The
remaining properties for a particle size of 250µm are given in the following: a particle density
of 1350kg/m3, a gas density of 0.8988kg/m3 (which corresponds to a pressure of 10bar), a
bed diameter of 0.1m, superﬁcial gas velocity of 0.171m s−1 and gas diffusion coefﬁcient of
1×10−5 m2/s was initially chosen. Across the different scales, all dimensionless numbers of
eq. (2.10) and the temperature are kept constant; additionally, it was assumed according to the
Chapman Enskog theory [34] that the diffusion coefﬁcient is roughly proportional to 1/P. The
mass transfer between bubble and dense phase increases with increasing particle diameter,
because the minimum ﬂuidization velocity increases, see eq. (2.12). The external mass transfer
around a catalyst particle is decreased, because the particle size is included via the Reynolds
number with a negative exponent, see eq. (2.13).
The internal mass transfer limitation of a catalyst particle is obviously also a function of its
diameter and may change during scale-up. However still, if one can ensure, that no mass
transfer limitations are changed, Glicksman’s criteria can be applied.
An easy and direct way to avoid changing mass transfer limitations, selectivity and activity is to
keep the same catalyst particle size, temperature and pressure for the different scales. This can
be accomplished with the sectoral scale-up approach for ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals.
The sectoral scale-up approach basically replaces the absolute bed diameter in Glicksman’s
dimensionless numbers with the hydraulic diameter of the bed, which is kept constant [207].

Methanation reaction in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed
A simpliﬁed process chain for the wood to synthetic natural gas (SNG)- and the power to gas
(PtG) process, has already been described in chapter 1. Figure 1.1 depicts the pathways to
produce SNG from woody biomass and renewable electricity, respectively.
For the wood to SNG process, the gasiﬁcation of dry woody biomass is the ﬁrst step in
the process chain for SNG production. Different commercial gasiﬁers are available for this
purpose. Dependent on factors, such as the feedstock, size, operational pressure, temperature,
and desired gas composition, a suitable technology can be chosen. More details about the
inﬂuence of the different process parameters on gasiﬁcation are given in [132]. Different
gasiﬁcation technologies are described in the following reviews [15, 192].
The gas exiting the gasiﬁcation unit is mainly composed of CH4, CO, CO2, H2 and H2O.
Additionally, several undesired chemical byproducts in form of particulates, tars, sulfur
compounds, chlorides and alkali metals can be found. The catalyst particles within the
methanation reactor downstream of the gasiﬁer, however, only permit a certain maximum
concentration of these byproducts. Especially the sulfur species and chlorides are known to be
catalyst poisons. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements a gas cleaning and conditioning
unit is employed downstream the gasiﬁer. Gas cleaning is referred to as the removal of
impurities and catalyst poisons, whereas gas conditioning is the chemical conversion of
different species, for example the decomposition of higher hydrocarbons. Currently, the
gas cleaning technology operates at low temperatures, where condensation of water occurs.
First, particulate matter is removed by gas ﬁlters, subsequently a gas washer removes tars,
and afterwoods a ZnO bed is applied to remove the sulfur species. This operation involves
the cooling and the subsequent heating of the gases, and is therefore thermodynamically
unfavorable [186]. Research therefore focuses on hot gas cleaning options to increase the
27

Chapter 2. Fluidized bed and methanation technology
overall efﬁciency of the wood to SNG process. Detailed information on gas cleaning for
biomass gasiﬁcation is provided in [253] and in the following dissertations [196, 198]. After
the gas cleaning the gas needs further conditioning before it can be fed to the methanation
reactor. This composes the adjustment of hydrogen to carbon ratio, either by adding steam
(see eq. (2.14)), with the disadvantage of generating carbon dioxide, or directly by adding
hydrogen (e.g., produced from renewable electricity).

Further, dependent on the type of methanation reactor, its dimensions and type of catalyst, etc.,
attempts have been made to decompose the higher hydrocarbons during the gas conditioning
step to prevent deposition of atomic carbon on the nickel-containing catalyst, which may
result in its deactivation [14]. The decomposition of higher hydrocarbons can for instance
be described by eqs. (2.15) and (2.16), [228]. For large-scale methanation reactors the high-
pressure Rectisol® wash can be applied to remove higher hydrocarbons, however, this requires
certain minimum dimensions.

The exothermic methanation reaction takes place in a catalytic, bubbling ﬂuidized reactor
by means of a nickel-containing catalyst, eq. (2.17) (refer back to section 2.3 for details about
the ﬂuidized bed technology). Within the reactor the educt gas is converted to methane,
water, and by-products, such as carbon dioxide. The kinetics of the methanation reaction
have been studied in a novel catalytic plate reactor [136]. As also described by other authors,
the measurement of the intrinsic kinetics are a challenge because of the highly exothermic
methanation reaction [265].

Catalyst deactivation during methanation in bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors is mainly caused
by organic sulfur components, which means, sulfur species have to be removed upstream from
the methanation reactor [218]. Once the sulfur species have been removed, a well-designed
bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor offers an internal regeneration of the employed catalyst in the
higher regions of the bed [216]. For instance, excess hydrogen helps to avoid carbon deposition
on the nickel catalyst (eq. (2.18)), which may cause sintering and early deactivation of the
catalyst [50]. Carbon deposition is favored for low temperatures and high pressures according
28

2.8. Methanation reaction in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed
to Le Chatelier’s principle. It was shown, that the internal regeneration is dependent on the
hydrodynamics as well as the chemical boundary conditions [134].
To enable the produced SNG to be fed into the natural gas grid, a gas upgrading step is
employed downstream from the BFB methanation reactor to remove different gases, such as
carbon dioxide, water vapour, and excess hydrogen, which lower the caloriﬁc value of the gas.
Moreover, the Wobbe index, deﬁned as the ratio between the volumetric higher heating value
and the square root of the relative gas density, has to meet the speciﬁed values, as described
in more details in [229]. The overall efﬁciency of the process chain from woody biomass to
grid-quality SNG is considered to be about 65 %, [76].

3 Theory measurement techniques
3.1
X-ray tomographic measurement techniques
3.1.1
Absorption contrast X-ray tomography
Absorption contrast X-ray tomography allows the non-destructive visualization of the in- and
outside of complex three-dimensional objects. For this purpose X-ray beams radiograph
different phases within an object and the attenuation of the beam is measured with a X-ray
detector. If the measurements are taken for different directions the resulting data can be
utilized for three-dimensional image reconstruction.
Absorption contrast X-ray tomography was ﬁrst applied by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, who
recorded a two-dimensional X-ray image, exposing his wife’s hand. For this achievement he
was granted the Nobel Prize in 1901. It is well suited to distinguish between hard and soft
tissues, e.g., to visualize bones in the human body. Absorption contrast measurements directly
determine the intensity decay through a two-dimensional object.
In the case of a monochromatic X-ray beam the intensity is reduced according to the Lambert
Beer law eq. (3.1), where I0 is the photon intensity when the system is under vacuum, µa
denotes the linear absorption coefﬁcient, and x is the slab thickness.
I = I0exp(−µax)
(3.1)
Well established areas of application are medical imaging, ﬂaw detection, reverse engineering,
and security scans in the transport sector. In recent years absorption contrast X-ray tomogra-
phy has also played an important role in the investigation of the hydrodynamic properties
of bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors, because it is a non-invasive measurement technique

suited to examine the size, rise velocity, hold-up, and distribution of bubbles. Ultra-fast X-ray
equipment is used to satisfy the demands of the high temporal resolutions.
One of the ﬁrst X-ray machines for continuous ﬂow visualization was proposed by Johansen et
al. [123]. They developed a X-ray tomograph consisting of ﬁve radiation sources and 85 com-
pact detectors. A schematic presentation is provided in ﬁgure 3.1. With their instrumentation
about 30 frames per second were recorded.
A current implementation of ultra-fast X-ray instrumentation with a moving X-ray source
is depicted in ﬁgure 3.2a. An electron beam is focused on a tungsten target to produce the
X-ray beams [99]. The apparatus achieves a high temporal- (10000 Hz) and spatial resolution
(1 mm); however, the maximum object diameter is limited to 12 cm [100]. In ﬁgure 3.2b
another instrument is depicted, allowing either a two-dimensional ﬂow mapping or a three-
dimensional reconstruction with a low time resolution, due to the moving X-ray scanner.
However, the instrumentation in ﬁgure 3.2b enables the use of larger columns up to 32 cm in
diameter and a vertical height of nearly 4 m.
In this work absorption contrast X-ray tomography was used for all the measurements that
were conducted. The equipment that was utilized was developed at the Delft University of
Technology [179]. All details of this instrumentation are provided in section 4.3.1.
3.1.2
Differential phase contrast X-ray tomography
Differential phase contrast X-ray tomography is another technique that enables complex
three-dimensional structures to be visualized. Although this technique allows the attainment
of much higher contrast and resolution, it usually requires more sophisticated equipment,
such as a synchrotron, X-ray optics, and special detectors.
The usually higher spatial resolution of differential phase contrast tomography could be
applied for the visualization of particle ﬂow in bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors. Knowledge
of the particle ﬂow around and inside gas bubbles would help to improve the understanding
of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds in terms of mass transfer limitations and the effective
surface area of these gas bubbles. The detailed ﬂow of particles around internals in ﬂuidized
beds might also be visualized, which would be advantageous for heat transfer calculations
and abrasion investigations.
The basic principle of differential phase contrast tomography was discovered by Frits Zernike
in 1942 and the application of this method for microscopy enabled him to win the Nobel Prize
in 1953 [264]. In 1965, Ulrich Bonse and Michael Hart presented the ﬁrst crystal interferometer,
which was required to adapt the differential phase contrast technique from microscopy to X-
ray tomography [23]. An example of a X-ray interferometer is depicted in ﬁgure 3.3. It consists
of a monochromator, a beam splitter, a mirror, an analyzer, and a detector. A synchrotron
light source is applied for producing the X-ray beam, because a monochromatic, highly
polarized X-ray beam of high brilliance is typically required for the experiments. The phase

shift measurement in a material is most directly accomplished with such a device in which the
wavefront is split into two parts, one of which propagates through a rotating sample and the
other through a reference path, typically vacuum or air. The two waves are then recombined
at the analyzer to form an interference pattern, where differences in the phase are revealed as
local shifts of the fringe pattern [11].
Recently established techniques usually rely on the observation of these interference patterns;
examples are crystal interferometry [177], grating-based imaging [225], propagation-based
imaging [251], or analyzer based imaging [53]. The beneﬁt of these techniques compared
to absorption contrast tomography in clinical imaging is an enhanced ability to distinguish
between different kinds soft tissues, such as tumors and normal tissue [71].
In the following, the physical principal of the differential phase contrast imaging is derived.
The mathematical equations and theory were adapted from [11]. The behavior of a X-ray
beam in a medium can be described by using a complex index of refraction n (eq. (3.2)). In
eq. (3.2), β denotes the absorption coefﬁcient of X-rays and δ is the phase-shift term which
integrates refractive effects.
n = 1−δ+iβ
(3.2)
Inserting eq. (3.2) into the expression for the electric ﬁeld of a plane electromagnetic wave
eq. (3.3), which propagates in a forward direction, and relating the wave number k to the
refractive index by ω/k = c/n = c/(1−δ+iβ), integrates the complex index of refraction n with
the formula of the electric ﬁeld, see eq. (3.4) for the result.
Ee(x,t) = Ee,0exp (−i (ωt −kx))
(3.3)
34

3.2. Tomographic image reconstruction techniques
Note, ω is the angular frequency and c is the phase velocity in vacuum. The ﬁrst exponential
in eq. (3.4) represents the phase advance for a wave propagating through vacuum, the second
term is the phase shift, and the third exponential term is the decay of the wave amplitude.

The total phase shift φ can be calculated by integrating the incident X-ray beam according to
eq. (3.5), and thus the projection depicts the decay of the real part in the imaging direction.
Therewith the main requirement of tomographic imaging, which is that a projection should
contain information about the sample structure, is fulﬁlled and reconstruction is possible. In
eq. (3.5) λ depicts the wavelength of the incoming X-ray beam.

Furthermore, the density distribution of a sample can be obtained by eq. (3.6), where the
atomic number density is ρa, the absorption cross-section is σa, and the phase-shift cross-
section is ps.
β = ρaσa

and
δ = ρaps

(3.6)
Inserting typical values for human tissue to calculate β and δ indicates that the phase-shift
term δ is roughly three orders of magnitude larger than the absorption coefﬁcient β. Hence,
differential phase contrast imaging is much more sensitive for medical imaging, e.g., for the
comparison of different soft tissues, compared to absorption contrast tomography [11].

Tomographic image reconstruction techniques
3.2.1
Analytical image reconstruction
There is a large variety of different image reconstruction techniques available and the devel-
opment in the different areas of applications is still ongoing. In general, one can distinguish
between analytical and iterative reconstruction techniques. Both of them have certain
advantages and disadvantages.
In clinical imaging, ﬁltered back projection is usually applied, which is an analytical re-
construction technique. It is mathematically stable and computationally efﬁcient [233];
however, it is necessary to record the image from many different uniformly distributed angles.
This is usually achieved by rotating the source and detector array around the patient. The
maximum time resolution with such instrumentation is therefore not high and it is unsuited
for the investigation of ﬂuidized bed processes. Furthermore, the main focus of research and
development in clinical imaging is the reduction of the radiation dose. More details about
clinical imaging and ﬁltered back projection can, for instance, be found in [124].

3.2.2
Iterative image reconstruction
For systems with a limited number of recorded angles, e.g. because of a higher requirement in
terms of time resolution, the ﬁltered back projection technique cannot be applied for image
reconstruction. For such under-determined systems, iterative reconstruction techniques are
typically used for image reconstruction. Possible reconstruction algorithms are the algebraic
reconstruction technique (ART), the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT),
and the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) published by [7]. For the
tomographic image reconstruction in this work, the SART algorithm was applied, see the
results in chapter 5 for more details.
Iterative algorithms are suited for the reconstruction of data with a limited number of measure-
ment angles [256], for example for the investigation of bubbling ﬂuidized beds [27]. Common
to all these iterative techniques is the superimposition of a grid over the measurement plane
for reconstruction, see ﬁgure 3.4a. The solid fraction of the pixels in the grid is changed in
an iterative way by most methods until, e.g., the minimum squared difference between the
measurement and reconstructed image is minimized. Figure 3.4b depicts a top-view of a
bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor with a fan beam and a detector array.
The sequence to obtain a reconstructed image is as follows. First a calibration of the mea-
surement instrumentation is conducted. For a polychromatic X-ray beam, so-called beam
hardening effects have to be taken into account, which means that high-energy photons are
absorbed more slowly, because the linear absorption coefﬁcient is dependent on the energy
of the photons. This results in a higher fraction of high-energy photons within the X-ray
beam after the object to be measured. To overcome this inaccuracy, not only a two-point
calibration, but a seven-point calibration was proposed [179], see section 4.3.1 for details
about the calibration and X-ray setup.
36

3.2. Tomographic image reconstruction techniques
With the calibration the measured intensity data from the detector array is converted into a
path-length of particles and air for each individual ray. According to eq. (3.7), the total solid
fraction ˜pi of each individual ray i, in the following referred to as ray sum, can be estimated
as the length of the ray i through each pixel j deﬁned by the linear weighting factor Wi,j
times the solid fraction αj of each pixel j. This solid fraction αj has to be iteratively found by
the reconstruction algorithm. Wi,j can be calculated in advance from geometric boundary
conditions and the ray sum is measured.
˜pi =
N
X

(3.7)
The SART algorithm combines the advantages of the ART and SIRT techniques, by applying
the average of the corrections generated by all rays to a pixel. This offers a reduction in the
amplitude of the so-called salt-and-pepper noise compared to other iterative reconstruction
techniques, but with the cost of higher computational time [179]. Equation (3.8) shows the
implementation of the SART algorithm.

To further reduce the signal noise, a method referred to as the one-step-late algorithm can be
applied [92]. As can be seen in eq. (3.9), a median ﬁlter Med(αj) removes the pepper-and-salt
by exchanging each pixel value by the median of the 3x3 surrounding pixels. The parameter β
controls the weight of the correction, and for the reconstructions in chapter 5 it is set to 0.1.

3.2.3
Iterative image reconstruction with internals
As soon as the internals were used, either the calibration dataset or the measurement data
need to be adapted, because the density of the internals and their linear absorption coefﬁcient
usually deviate from those of the bed material. The method most likely to yield signiﬁcant
results would be to perform a second calibration of the apparatus with the internals; however,
this is not necessarily the ideal solution if the measurements with and without vertical internals
are compared. We addressed this problem by choosing a mathematical correction to account
for the vertical internals. The correction can be conducted for polychromatic X-ray beams
as long as the density difference between the bed particle and the thin-walled acrylic glass
tubes ﬁlled with particles that were employed, is small. For large density differences beam
hardening effects need to be considered and the mathematical correction, which is based on
the Lambert Beer law can no longer be applied. The concept described above is presented
visually in ﬁgure 3.5 to facilitate understanding. Note, in ﬁgure 3.5, µ1 is the linear absorption

coefﬁcient in the bed, µ2 is the linear absorption coefﬁcient of the internals, and ∆s as well
as ∆h are the path-lengths. The X-ray beam intensity decays exponentially without vertical
tubes. However, when vertical tubes are employed, the slope of the intensity decay is changed,
because of changes in the linear absorption coefﬁcient. To the left of the ﬁrst internal, the
intensity can be calculated according to eq. (3.10).

3.3. Hydrodynamic measurements with optical probes
With the help of this correction factor fcor the intensity measurement with employed vertical
internals can be converted into the intensity, which would have been measured without
internals and the same calibration data can be used for image reconstruction. Note, the
correction factor is independent from any ﬂuidization conditions; once calculated, it is kept
unchanged. In reality, the easiest way to obtain this correction factor for each individual
detector is to perform a measurement with and without tubes at zero gas velocity, because the
calibration was also done without ﬂuidization.
Knowledge of the positions of the vertical internals can further be used in the modiﬁed SART
algorithm. By deﬁnition, no bubbles can be present at the positions of the vertical tubes in
the bed. This constraint can be integrated by setting all pixel values αj at the positions of the
heat exchanger tubes to those of solid material, in every loop of the iterative code. Hence,
the resolution of the algorithm is enhanced, and well-deﬁned bubble surfaces are obtained
near the internals. These ideas can be implemented in most of the iterative reconstruction
techniques, as shown for the example of the SART, which is applied for image reconstruction
in chapter 5.
3.3
Hydrodynamic measurements with optical probes
3.3.1
Principal of local measurements
Detailed hydrodynamic information of bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors can also be gathered
by performing local optical probe measurements. Usually a two-point probe is applied, with
the two probe tips being vertically separated by approximately 1cm. Each optical probe is
capable of performing a high-resolution temporal analysis, whether particles or a gas bubble
is located at either tip. With these intrusive local probes, important hydrodynamic properties
such as mean values and distributions of local bubble properties, such as size, rise velocity,
hold-up, frequency, and available interfacial area, can be obtained [32, 105, 243, 262].
For a low measurement frequency, the accuracy with which fast bubbles can be measured
decreases, due to the discretization of the signal, as shown for a 400Hz measurement in
table 3.1. The minimum measurable time of ﬂight ∆tmin of a bubble between the two sensor
tips can be calculated according to eq. (3.14), where f is the measurement frequency. For
a 400Hz measurement, the minimum measurable time is 0.0025s, which corresponds to
a bubble rise velocity (BRV) of 4m s−1 for the two probe tips, which are separated by 1cm
vertically. The next measurable time is 0.0050s, which corresponds to a BRV of 2m s−1. Thus,
it is not possible to measure any of the velocities in between these two values with such a low
measurement frequency.

Vice versa, for a given BRV, the exact time required between the ﬁrst and second sensor ∆t can
be calculated, when the distance s between the lower and upper sensor is known. However, the
discretization of the signal causes an error in the time measurement. The maximum measured
BRVmax can be calculated according to eq. (3.15). The minimum velocity at which the bubbles
rise BRVmin, can be calculated by adding 1/f to ∆t instead of subtracting it. Therewith, the
deviations in the locally measured BRV can be calculated, as summarized in table 3.2.
The discretization of the signal led to the proposal of a higher measurement frequency of
about 5000Hz, with the aim of reducing the errors made when measuring the time required by
the bubbles to traverse the distance between the lower and upper sensor. With a measurement
frequency of 5000Hz the maximum deviation for a real BRV of 3.5m s−1 is 7.5%, and the
resolution for BRVs, which are less than 2m s−1 are better than 0.1m s−1.
BRVmax =

∆t −1/f
(3.15)
In addition, error propagation causes a subsequent error when the locally measured chord-
length of the bubbles is calculated, which can be done by means of eq. (3.16), where tb is the
bubble residence time at the lower sensor.
dchord = BRV tb
(3.16)
The bubble hold-up can be determined by optical probes, which is probable the most accurate
way to determine the local bubble hold-up. As proposed by [243, 30], the bubble hold-up can
be measured with optical probes according to eq. (3.17).

Transferring local measurements to global results
The optical probes can be used to measure values, such as the local bubble hold-up, at several
radial positions in the bubbling ﬂuidized bed (BFB) reactor. Based on that measurement,
the mean bubble hold-up can be calculated directly by using eq. (3.18). However, it should

An explanation for the increased difﬁculty of calculating the global BRV and chord-length
requires a two-dimensional thought experiment to be performed. For instance, what would
be measured if local measurements were simultaneously conducted at several radial positions
in a ﬂuidized bed column (with a distance of 1cm between the probe tips in radial direction)?
A single bubble, with a diameter of 5cm, is measured by ﬁve or six probes in parallel. Hence,
when e.g. the number-weighted mean bubble rise velocity is calculated, a 5cm bubble would
be counted ﬁve or six times. A bubble with a 2cm diameter would only be counted two or
41

Chapter 3. Theory measurement techniques
Figure 3.6: Calculation of the mean chord-length in two dimensions
three times. Therefore, the bubble rise velocity of larger bubbles would be emphasized and a
systematic error could be introduced if the mean is calculated as shown in eq. (3.18).
Usually, optical probe measurements are not simultaneously conducted at several radial
positions. However, exactly the same difﬁculty arises in the case in which different radial
positions are measured sequentially, because the probability of a large bubble being pierced
remains higher. The probability is only a function of the bubble size, distribution, and
reactor dimensions and for a measurement time of sufﬁcient duration, the calculated number-
weighted mean values would be exactly the same. Again, there would be a greater emphasis
on larger bubbles and the calculated number-weighted mean value would be biased. An
alternative calculation of the global mean BRV based on local measurements is presented in
section 5.2.
The locally measured, number-weighted mean chord-length of a bubble with a 5cm diameter
would roughly be between 3 and 4cm, whereas that of a smaller bubble with a 2cm diameter
would be between 0.7 and 1.7cm. The number-weighted mean chord-length of both bubbles
would be between 2.2 and 3.4cm. Thus, it is not at all evident how the global number-weighted
mean bubble diameter could be extracted from these measurements.
Assuming all the bubbles in a two-dimensional bed have the same size, a correlation can
be derived from ﬁgure 3.6, which connects the number-weighted mean chord-length for an
inﬁnite number of measurements and bubbles with the bubble diameter πr/2, eq. (3.19).
However, this correlation would only exist if a single bubble size is present in the bed and
would need to be adapted for three dimensions.

3.3. Hydrodynamic measurements with optical probes
For a bubble swarm with a certain bubble size distribution, this connection would not be
possible. Probably the best solution for estimating the number-weighted mean bubble
diameter in a real BFB reactor, was proposed by [209]. They were able to show that for
all realistic bubble size distributions occurring in ﬂuidized beds, the measured number-
weighted mean chord-length approximately corresponds to the number-weighted mean
bubble diameter of all the bubbles in the bed.
The interfacial area can also be estimated based on optical measurements. The interfacial area
concentration (IAC) is often deﬁned as the total interface area between the bubble and dense
phase per unit volume. In its simplest form, assuming spherical bubbles, it can be written as
derived in eq. (3.20). For a known bubble size distribution (e.g., measured by a complementary
method), the interfacial area concentration can be more accurately calculated, upon which
eq. (3.20) transforms to eq. (3.21).

3.3.3
Bubble linking
In this work, a modiﬁed bubble linking algorithm was applied for bubble detection. For the
evaluation of the optical probe signals the least sum of the squared residuals was used to
determine the bubble transit times between the two probe positions. For more information
on the bubble linking algorithm, refer to [235, 205]. According to ﬁgure 3.7, two thresholds
are applied in the bubble linking algorithm. The lower threshold T ha is speciﬁed to calculate
the bubble passage time at the ﬁrst, lower sensor as well as the transit time between the
ﬁrst and second sensor. T ha is approximately the 99% quantile of the data set minus 4% of
the maximum peak depth of the entire signal; however, it is directly deﬁned by a sensitivity
analysis to be as close as possible to the phase change between the bubble and dense phase.
When the values of T ha are too high, it will lead to a decrease in the measured bubble passage
time. In ﬁgure 3.7, all correctly linked bubbles are connected by a vertical red line. The higher
threshold T hb is applied to identify the existence of a bubble. It is deﬁned as the 99% quantile
of the data set minus 12% of the maximum peak depth of the entire signal. The bubble-linking
algorithm described above was used for all measurements conducted with optical probes, see
e.g. section 5.7.

3.4. Particle attrition test methods

Particle attrition test methods
Any test system for particle attrition only makes sense if the results are directly transferable
to a real system. In this respect, Bemrose et al. produced a very thorough review of the
different attrition test methods [17] by dividing them into single particle (crushing or impact)
and multiple particle tests. As abrasion requires the interaction of more than one particle,
it obviously can only be tested in multiple particle tests, whereas fragmentation is mainly
deﬁned by the properties of the material itself, thereby enabling single particle tests to be
performed.
All of these methods share the fact that they attempt to predict the behavior of particles in
real-world applications by using well-deﬁned test procedures to:
• Reduce the amount of material needed
• Reduce the time required for testing
• Reduce the effort involved in testing
• Reduce the working time needed for expensive test rigs by using simpler equipment
A frequently quoted thought experiment used to illustrate the difﬁculties relating to attrition
experiments is that “if we took a batch of rubber pencil erasers and a batch of diamonds, and
rubbed them on abrasive paper, we would conclude that the diamonds were more attrition
resistant. If we instead struck the particles with a hammer we would conclude that the rubber
erasers were more attrition resistant, [191]. It is therefore not surprising that there has been a
wide variety of methods developed for the laboratory-scale testing of particle attrition.

Glass column bubbling ﬂuidized bed for scale-up and attrition tests
Experiments to investigate hydrodynamic phenomena, scale-up, and attrition, were con-
ducted by using a cylindrical glass column with a 14.5cm inner diameter. The column can
be equipped with different types of vertical tube banks, often expressed as vertical internals,
to mimic a ﬂuidized bed reactor with immersed heat exchanger tubes. Such a reactor type

can be used for highly exothermic reactions, such as the methanation reaction [218]. The
vertical tubes for the scale-up experiments had an outer diameter of 1.0cm, 0.9cm spacing
between the tubes and a squared arrangement. The vertical tubes for the attrition experiments
had an outer diameter of 2.0cm, a 0.9cm cm tube spacing and a squared arrangement. The
bed height of the non-ﬂuidized bed was 50cm for all tested cross-sections. The equipment is
shown in ﬁgure 4.1a. In ﬁgure 4.1b, the top-view of the different u-shaped inserts, which were
used to vary the open cross-sectional area during the scale-up experiments, is depicted. In
ﬁgure 4.1c, the top-view of the internals, used during the attrition experiments is shown. The
glass column was always used with compressed air at room temperature and pressure.
The red ports in front of the column are ﬂanges with which piezo-electric sensors for pressure
ﬂuctuation measurements (Kistler, type 7261) can be connected. Two further ports are
available to mount optical sensor probes, at heights of 243 mm and 450 mm above the sintered
distributor plate (10 µm pore size) on both sides of the column. Details about the optical
probes are provided in section 4.3.2. The open cross-sectional area can optionally be reduced
by installing one of four u-shaped proﬁles, also referred to as inserts, in the equipment
ﬁgure 4.1b. The installation also served to mimic the different scales. The obtained open
cross-section contained 9, 19, 28, respectively 37 vertical tubes. The remaining cross-section
was closed by a gas-tight seal. The u-shaped proﬁles were attached to the outer column wall by
closed pore foam to obtain a tight ﬁt. The gas-tight sealing of the u-shaped proﬁles was tested
by comparing the pressure drop versus gas velocity, bed expansion, and minimum ﬂuidization
velocity for each alignment with the values measured in the open, circular bed. That ensured
a deﬁned gas-ﬂow inside the rectangular area where the measurements were performed.
The attrition and elutriation experiments were performed by mounting a melt-blown polypropy-
lene ﬁlter (Seﬁltec, MBR1PE10) with a pore size of 1 µm downstream from the bubbling
ﬂuidized bed to collect any elutriated particles. A gravimetric analysis of this ﬁlter was
performed at time intervals from 1 to 48 hours depending on the expected elutriated amount.
At all measurement points, powder samples were taken from both the ﬁlter and ﬂuidized bed,
which were later analyzed by using a ﬁeld emission gun scanning electron microscope (Zeiss
ULTRA 55) additionally equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX/Ametek)
and by a laser diffraction particle sizer (Horiba, LA-950).
4.1.2
Plexiglas® columns with and without vertical internals for X-ray experiments
X-ray experiments were conducted with two types of special Plexiglas® columns. The columns
can be optionally equipped with vertical internals, which mimic vertical heat exchanger tubes.
• Column type 1: Lab-scale ﬂuidized bed column with a inner diameter of 14 cm
• Column type 2: Pilot-scale ﬂuidized bed column with a inner diameter of 22.4 cm
48

4.1. Bubbling ﬂuidized bed setups
The settled bed height of the bubbling ﬂuidized beds used during the X-ray experiments was
between 50 and 61 cm. A top-view of the columns is depicted in ﬁgure 4.2. The small column
is equipped with 16 removable vertical internals, four of which have a 1 cm outer diameter,
whereas the remaining 12 have a 2 cm outer diameter. The tube spacing is 1 cm for both
columns, which results in a space of about 1.2 cm between the tubes and the column wall. The
larger column is equipped with 32 vertical tubes of 2 cm and 12 tubes with a outer diameter of
1 cm.
The main difference between the two columns is that for the larger column a porous sinter
metal distributor plate with a pore size of 10 µm and a thickness of 3 mm was used (Filterronde
R 10, 181107 40, Tridelta Siperm GmbH), whereas for the smaller column a polyethylene
distributor plate with a pore size of 20 µm and a thickness of 5 mm (THOMAPOR® Sinterplatte,
12150, Reichelt Chemietechnik GmbH) was used.
The conﬁguration of the internals are shown in ﬁgures 4.2a and 4.2b (top-view); the smaller
1 cm tubes are required for reactors with relatively small diameters to ensure no gas bypass
occurs near the column wall and to maintain the hydraulic diameter approximately constant
at all positions in the column. The conﬁguration of the tube sizing and spacing of the internals
was determined by maximizing the heat transfer area as well as by economic considerations.
Additionally, the pressure drop within the heat exchanger tubes has to be within an acceptable
limit, which is the case for tubes with diameters of 2 cm. The column and internals are
manufactured from acrylic glass. For all experiments, the internals are ﬁlled with bed material.
The required gas volume ﬂow for minimum ﬂuidization is measured for the column without
vertical internals and is calculated from the reduction of the cross-sectional area for the mea-
surement with vertical internals. Compressed air is used for the ﬂuidization. All experiments
are conducted at room temperature and pressure.

diffraction measurements to be 289µm and the sphericity was obtained by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images to be 0.59. The dense phase voidage was calculated with the Wen &
Yu correlation [241] to be 0.5. The particle density provided by the manufacturer is 1350kg/m3
and the internal angle of friction was calculated by applying the “bin ﬂow” method [263] to
be 33.3◦. The minimum ﬂuidization velocity of the particles is approximately 3cm s−1. The
particles are in the intermediate range between Geldart A & B [80, 81]. These particles were
chosen, because their behavior is similar to that of commercial catalysts [218].
Dolomite was used as a second material in the attrition experiments. Most of the properties,
such as the mean particle size, bulk density, and minimum ﬂuidization velocity of the particles
was measured, table 4.1. The bed height for the attrition experiments was 50 cm. The volume-
weighted particle size distribution of each material is provided in ﬁgure 4.3 with the dolomite
having been sieved to achieve a similar particle size distribution to that of the γ-alumina.

Measurement equipment
4.3.1
X-ray tomographic equipment
In this work, a X-ray apparatus developed at the Delft University of Technology was employed
to investigate the different hydrodynamic properties in bubbling ﬂuidized beds with and
without vertical internals. A schematic representation of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed placed in
the center of the ultra-fast X-ray scanner is depicted in ﬁgure 4.4. The equipment consists of
three stationary X-ray sources, tube 1, 2, and 3 and six horizontal detector arrays in two rows
above each other. Each of the six detector arrays is equipped with 32 detectors, measuring
the attenuation of the X-rays with 2500 Hz. As described in [179], the X-ray sources that were
employed are produced by Yxlon International GmbH, and their maximum X-ray energy is
150 keV. The sources were operated at a low energy ﬂux, i.e., the tube current was usually
less than 1 mA. The detectors consist of a CdWO4 scintillation crystal, which is optically
51

Chapter 4. Experimental setups
coupled to a PIN photodiode. The detectors are manufactured by Hamamatsu (type: S
1337 -1010BR) and have a crystal size of 10 mm×10 mm×10 mm. The distance between the
focal point of the source and the detector crystals is equal for all detectors. The signal was
simultaneously recorded for the upper and lower ring of detectors. A 12-bit ADC card was used
to acquire the signal, which was consecutively stored on a workstation. The entire process
was controlled from outside the X-ray room, which was lined with lead. Data processing and
image reconstruction were performed ofﬂine, see section 3.2.2 for details.
The rows of arrays on the detector are vertically separated by 40 mm. They are differently
aligned for the 14 cm column and the 22.4 cm column, and are described in section 4.1.2. The
measurement fan beams through the 14 cm column are on average 10.7 mm apart (8.4 mm
when they enter the column, and 13.1 mm on the other side), see ﬁgure 4.4 for a schematic
representation. The corresponding average dimensions for the 22.4 cm column are 18.2 mm
(15.4 mm when they enter the column, and 21 mm on the other side). Each measurement was
conducted for two minutes, which commonly resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant amount of
data and a small standard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean was calculated
by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size (i.e., the number of
bubbles).
In an additional experiment, the inﬂuence of the optical probes on the bubble hydrodynamics
was studied by the X-ray tomograph. The alignment of the column and the X-ray equipment
is depicted in ﬁgure 4.5a, and the design of the optical probe is described in section 4.3.2.
For calibration purposes, the seven segments were ﬁlled sequentially until the reactor was
full of bed particles, as shown in ﬁgure 4.5b. Performed in the three directions of the X-ray
sources, this procedure links the measured intensity of every detector to the corresponding
fraction of particles. The calibration only needs to be performed without vertical internals (a
comprehensive explanation is provided in section 3.2.3). The seven-point calibration helps
to consider the beam-hardening effects of the polychromatic radiation in the calibration [5].
Thus, the attenuation of the X-rays can be converted into a path-length of existing cavities
(i.e., bubbles).
The simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which was already applied by
[179], was used for two-dimensional image reconstruction, see sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 for
details. For each reconstructed image the mean of 10 measurements was obtained, resulting
in an effective time resolution of 250 Hz. The measurements presented in ﬁgure 4.6 were
performed by inserting two empty thin-walled acrylic glass tubes with a diameter of 2.2 cm
and 5.2 cm, respectively, into the equipment to evaluate the accuracy of the technique. The
raw data presented in ﬁgure 4.6a were converted into the path-length of the cavities by using
the calibration data set and the resulting reconstructed image is presented in ﬁgure 4.6b. It
can be seen that the diameters in the reconstructed two-dimensional image are approximately
equal to the diameters of the acrylic glass tubes; however, a bubble diameter of 2 cm is the

Development of optical probes for ambient measurement
An optical probe for the measurement of bubble properties within a bubbling ﬂuidized bed
column at ambient pressure and temperature was developed. The objective was to produce a
simple and reliable tool to measure different bubble properties, such as the bubble size and
rise velocity, as described in detail in section 3.3.
One optical probe consists of two sensor tips. These two tips are vertically separated by
1 cm. Each sensor tip is made of a tube with a 5 mm outer diameter, in which a reﬂex
coupler (Kondenshi, type SG-2BC) is directly mounted behind a sapphire window, as shown
in ﬁgure 4.7a. The reﬂex coupler consists of an LED and a phototransistor combined in one
device. Each sensor tip is sensitive to incoming light, which means, when the optical probe
is placed in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed, the sensor tips are capable of detecting gas bubbles or
particles in front of the tips. The probe length of about 25 cm can easily be adapted to the
requirements.
The working principal is as follows: when particles are present in front of the sensor tip, the
LED light emitted by the reﬂex couplers is directly reﬂected by the particles. This causes a
certain resistance in the phototransistor and a concomitant potential difference across it. The
electric circuit to connect the reﬂex couplers is depicted in ﬁgure 4.7b. When gas bubbles
are present in front of the tip, no light is reﬂected and the resistance of the phototransistor is
changed. The potential difference across the phototransistor is measured by a voltmeter, which
is also illustrated in ﬁgure 4.7b. The voltmeter is connected to a fast data acquisition system to
record the signal; therewith, all necessary information about the bubbles are recorded.

Development of high temperature optical probes
Preliminary tests were conducted to assess the feasibility of using an optical transﬂexion
probe to detect different bubble properties by using a Hellma transﬂexion probe (Hellma, type
661.622-UV). After successful preliminary testing of the commercial probe at low temperatures,
and the unavailability of a probe suitable for sufﬁciently high temperatures, a project was
initiated to develop a custom-built high temperature and pressure optical transﬂexion probe
at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) from scratch. The probe has to be capable of detecting
gas bubbles under harsh conditions within a bubbling ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor.
Similar to the previously described cold optical probe,the two sensor tips have to be vertically
separated by 1 cm. The main difference between the working principals of the "cold" and
"hot" optical probes is, that the LED light is reﬂected by a mirror in the case of the hot optical
probe and not by the particles, because the catalyst particles absorb nearly all the light emitted
by the LED.
The project was divided into the following two parts:
• Part 1: Development of the hot optical probe for bubble detection
• Part 2: Development of a probe adapter to mount and move the probe in radial direction
The tender and performance speciﬁcation of the projects were ﬁrst elaborated. They include
the required safety speciﬁcations, as well as the requirements for the measurements in the
catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor. The mandatory requirements, which
need to be met for the hot optical probe and the probe adapter are summarized as follows:
• Detection of bubbles and particles at the probe tip
• Suited for temperatures up to 400 ◦C
• Suited for pressures up to 25 bar
• Permanently technically tight, also with ﬁne catalyst particles in the reactor
• Mountable to a ﬂange with nominal size DN25 and pressure class PN16
• Interchangeable during shut-down of the reactor
• Radially displaceable during shut-down of the reactor possible
The requirement to move the probe in radial direction in the presence of the ﬁne catalyst
particles in the ﬂuidized bed, was probably the most challenging design aspect. Therefore, as a
minimum requirement, the movement during reactor shut-down was speciﬁed; however,
allowing the radial movement of the optical probe during operation of the reactor was
desirable.

The possible interactions and risks of the project were also studied. The presence of ﬁne
particles in combination with the ﬂuidized bed increases the probability of the optical sensor
becoming obstructed to an extent that movement of the sensor in radial direction is prevented.
Thus, obstruction of the sensor had to be avoided within justiﬁable expense. Furthermore, the
considerable pressure acting on the sensor causes it to be pushed in radial direction out of
the reactor. This necessitated the employment of a stable support. The release of ﬂammable
and toxic gases as well as of the carcinogenic and pyrophoric catalytic particles has to be
avoided in any case. The permanent technical tightness of the sensor and its adapter was
tested in a cold-ﬂow bubbling ﬂuidized bed, to ensure reliable operation of the methanation
reactor. Finally, a HAZOP study of the complete sensor and sensor adapter connected to the
methanation reactor was conducted to ensure all safety requirements are met.
The construction and design of both parts were conducted in cooperation with a team from
the internal workshop. An assembly drawing of the complete sensor is depicted in ﬁgure 4.8.
Based on the strength calculation of the ﬂanges at the reactor and the HAZOP analysis it was
decided to additionally construct a support for the optical detectors, which is depicted in
ﬁgure 4.9. Therewith, it is ensured that the stress acting on the ﬂanges is always within the
acceptable range.
A three-dimensional representation of the hot optical sensor tip is shown in ﬁgure 4.10.
The sapphire window is depicted in blue, opposite to which a polished screw is depicted,
which is used as the mirror to reﬂect the LED light. The light is only reﬂected by the mirror
when a bubble is present between the screw and the sapphire window, because the catalyst
particles absorb nearly all the light. The screw can be exchanged to modify the available space
between the sapphire and the screw, which may be necessary when different particles are
analyzed. Each sensor tip contains nineteen special high temperature glass ﬁbers (IVG Fiber,
Cu400/440IR metal-coated optical ﬁber). The use of the optical ﬁbers made it possible to place
the LED light and phototransistor outside of the reactor, i.e., at ambient temperature. Addi-
tionally, this arrangement made it possible to avoid placing any electronics near potentially
explosive areas around the methanation reactor.

A ﬁrst prototype of the hot optical sensor and sensor adapter is ready to be used and was
already tested in a reactor without a methanation reaction in progress. The design of the probe
as well as that of the LED and phototransistor control unit was further improved by Frank
Schillinger.
4.3.4
Electrostatic charge measurements with Faraday cup
The Faraday cup depicted in ﬁgure 4.11 was constructed to measure the electrostatic charge
of particles in a ﬂuidized bed. It consists of an open cylindrical structure made up of an inner
and outer copper layer isolated from each other by an insulating PTFE layer.
The procedure to measure the electrostatic charge was previously described [61, 38, 126].
The outer layer of the Faraday cup is grounded, while the inner layer is connected via a BNC
connector to a pico-ammeter (Keithley, 487) and a computer running LabVIEW software.
Measurements were conducted by placing the cup outside of the ﬂuidized bed; a particle
sample was obtained through a hole in the outer wall during ﬂuidization and directly collected
in the Faraday cup. The collection of bed samples inside the Faraday cup during ﬂuidization
avoids particle discharge that could occur when interrupting the column operation before
collecting the sample. The electrostatic charge of the collected particles was measured
for different ﬂuidization numbers after deﬁned time intervals. Between the consecutive
experiments, the Faraday cup was washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried
with compressed air and weighed before and after collecting the next particles.
The electrostatic charge density (qm) was obtained in each test from the current induced by
the particles:

Particle attrition and elutriation
5.1.1
Abstract
For many processes performed in ﬂuidized beds, the mechanical stability of particles is of
major importance, and yet, despite this, previous studies have disagreed on the elutriated
amount and origin of ﬁne particles. This work investigates the attrition of particles in bubbling
ﬂuidized beds in more detail also to determine whether the examined differences in elutriation
are due to electrostatic or other interparticle forces. To achieve this, the forces acting during
ﬂuidization are mathematically derived, and the attrition of two particle types (alumina and
dolomite) are experimentally investigated. Based on the results obtained, a simple model is
developed to describe the attrition of both particle types.
5.1.2
Introduction
Particle attrition and elutriation is always present in ﬂuidized beds, but is particular important
in catalytic ﬂuidized beds in which chemical conversion can be highly dependent on the
amount of ﬁnes in the bed [249]. Industrial-scale production also needs to consider the need
to meet legislative and emission regulations, making the stability and attrition resistance
of particles of major importance [195]. Moreover, as the elutriation of ﬁnes can inﬂuence
processes downstream of the reactor, it is something that is usually best avoided. This can be
achieved by either preventing the production of ﬁnes through the use of attrition resistant
particles and/or mild ﬂuidization conditions, or preventing their elutriation by employing
cyclones, well-designed freeboards, and a ﬁlter unit downstream of the ﬂuidized bed [249].

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
A comparative study of more than 20 existing entrainment correlations has revealed discrep-
ancies in their predicted elutriation rates of up to eight orders of magnitude [36, 45]. Among
the various reasons that have been proposed for these discrepancies, such as the usage of
non-physically based models to predict particle elutriation, one possibility that has been
largely overlooked is the existence of electrostatic forces acting on the particles in a ﬂuidized
bed, preventing elutriation [6]. This work therefore takes a systematic approach to understand
the different interparticle forces. The forces are mathematically analyzed, their magnitude is
approximated and their possible inﬂuence on attrition as well as on elutriation is studied. This
is followed by experimental measurement of the attrition of γ-alumina (Al) and dolomite (Do)
particles over 100 and 500 hours in a laboratory scale bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor using
different gas velocities, during which any electrostatic charge on the particles is assessed (see
section 4.1.1 for details about the column and section 4.2 for details about the particles). This
is aimed at developing a model to accurately predict the attrition rate of both particle types
based on published work [230, 96] and the assumption that attrition is directly proportional to
the excess gas velocity.
5.1.3
Theory
Particle forces arising during ﬂuidization
In a ﬂuidized bed reactor, different forces are generated by the various interactions between
the ﬂuid, particles and the reactor itself, making a theoretical analysis of these important to
understanding how they can affect attrition and elutriation. These forces can be classiﬁed as
being either mechanical or interparticle in nature.
Interparticle forces are responsible for the agglomeration or adhesion of particles, which can
affect their ﬂuidization and the elutriation of ﬁnes out of the bed. For instance, ﬁnes can
adhere to larger particles or reactor walls or can form agglomerates, which inhibits elutriation
and increases the average residence time to as much as 150−500 times greater than that of
the gas in the bed [129]. Numerous studies have suggested that these interparticle forces can
inﬂuence attrition and elutriation, as demonstrated by the well-known difﬁculties in ﬂuidizing
Geldart group C powders due to their strong interparticle adhesion [81]. Indeed, there is a
general agreement as to the nature of these interparticle forces [56, 98, 12, 219, 263, 162],
with van der Waals (Fvdw) and electrostatic forces (Fe) considered to be dominant. Other
interparticle forces relating to liquid bridges and sintering do exist, but are not considered
relevant in this case given that their respective requirements of a humid environment and
high temperature do not apply here. In contrast, van der Waals forces are always present, but
are only noticeable when particles come within close contact to each other. This is described
by the Hamaker theory [98], and means that the surface roughness of the particle is important
in that it affects both the contact area and distance. The roughness of ﬂuidized particles is
not always known, but nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that it has a large effect
on the van der Waals adhesion force [60, 260]. For example, Schaefer et al. found that the
62

5.1. Particle attrition and elutriation
measured force of adhesion between rough surfaces could be as much as 50 times smaller
than the theoretical value for smooth surfaces [215].
The most probable van der Waals force during ﬂuidization is what is known as the London
dispersion force [98]: a weak intermolecular force arising from quantum-induced instanta-
neous polarization of multipoles in a molecule. If we consider a pair of spherical particles, the
maximum van der Waals force between them can be obtained by [120]:
Fvdw,pa−pa = −AH
6D2
µ R1R2
R1 +R2
¶
(5.1)
where AH is the Hamaker constant of the material (1.5×10−19 J for Al [157] and 1.04×10−19 J
for Do [161]), D is the distance between bodies, and R1 and R2 are the respective particle radii.
For the interaction between a spherical particle and ﬂat wall, this becomes [120]:
Fvdw,pa−su = −
AHRp
6D2
(5.2)
where Rp is the particle radius. The distance between bodies is generally assumed to be 4 Å
in all cases [142]. When the surface is not completely smooth, the distance between the two
contacting bodies is given by the distance, D, plus the radius of the asperities R′. Thus the van
der Waals force is reduced and calculated as [254]:
F ′
vdw =
AHRm
12(D +R′)2 =
Fvdw
¡
1+ R′
D
¢2
(5.3)
where Rm is the harmonic mean diameter of the particles in contact and F ′
vdw is the maximum
van der Waals force of attraction calculated without considering the effect of surface roughness.
Electrostatic forces between particles are more difﬁcult to calculate, as it is known that a
particle charge can vary depending on such variables as atmospheric humidity [149]. This
has led many authors to believe that there is in fact no evidence of electrostatic charge during
ﬂuidization, except when ﬂuidizing polymeric particles [122, 252]. Alumina and dolomite,
however, are dielectric materials that can become electrostatically charged by triboelectric
effects generated by particle-particle and particle-wall contact during ﬂuidization [91]. In
short, when two bodies come into contact there is a movement of electric charge through their
surface, which creates a positively charged double layer on one side, and a negatively charged
one on the other. When these particles are separated they can retain this electric charge, with
this again being inﬂuenced by the surface roughness and contact area [127].
The charging of particles is something that is hard to predict theoretically, but one approach is
to calculate the theoretical maximum charge (or dielectric strength) that a particle can build
up on its surface without losing its insulating properties. This maximum charge is limited by
the breakdown strength of the surrounding ﬂuid, which for air gives an electric breakdown
63

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
potential of 3×106 V m−1 and a permittivity of 8.8×10−12 C2N−1m−2, [122]. Thus, by applying
Gauss’ law, an estimate of the maximum charge for a spherical particle can be obtained [49]:
qe,max = 2.6410−5 ³

pmo
(5.4)
where pmo = 3εr /(εr +2) and εr is the dielectric constant or relative permittivity of the material.
Since the electrostatic force acting on a particle with a charge, q, in an electric ﬁeld, Ee, is
given by Fe = Eeq, the maximum electrostatic force at the point of incipient breakdown in air
is [122]:
Fe,max = 248.8d2
ppmo
(5.5)
Calculating the maximum electrostatic force as a function of particle diameter therefore only
requires knowing the static dielectric constant of the material. When the electrostatic charge
of a certain particle is known, it can be used to calculate the induced force between a spherical
particle and a neighboring grounded conducting substrate [199], where ε0 is the permittivity
of free space and q is the charge on a certain particle:
Fe,i =

The mechanical forces present during ﬂuidization consist of the weight force (Fw) associated
with the particle mass, the drag force (Fd) generated by particle-ﬂuid interactions and collision
forces (Fc) between particles and the reactor [12, 258]. The weight of a particle can be obtained
from Newton’s law, which for a spherical particle, deﬁnes the effective gravitational force as:

where dp is the particle diameter, ρp is the particle density and ρg is the ﬂuid density.
The drag force acting on a single particle in a ﬂuid at superﬁcial velocity can be obtained by
applying Stokes’ Law for small particles and ﬁnes:
Fd = 1

(5.8)
where CD is the drag coefﬁcient for a single particle, u is the superﬁcial gas velocity, Sp is the
cross-sectional area of the particle and Rep represents the Reynolds number of the particle.

The speed of an individual particle prior to collision can, for the sake of simplicity, be assumed
to be the same as when it is ﬁrst ejected into the freeboard by an erupting bubble. This, in turn,
can be estimated as twice the speed at which the bubble rises [83]. When a particle impacts at

or near-elastic regime [210]. Thus, by using Hertz elastic theory [231] for a collision without

involved in the interaction (6×1010 Pa for glass, with the values for the other materials given
in table 4.1), [79, 152].
Modeling attrition
Particle attrition and entrainment in ﬂuidized bed reactors has been experimentally studied
for 60 years [72, 148], yet it is only recently that computer models of particle attrition have
allowed us to understand the physics behind particle attrition in greater detail [77, 111, 175,
242]. This knowledge makes it evident that as a porous distributor plate is used in this study
without a cyclone, only bubble-induced attrition is worth considering. The attrition rate, rtot,
can therefore be deduced from the relative change in elutriated mass, mloss, per bed mass,
mbed, and unit of time, assuming of course that all ﬁnes are elutriated and collected in the
ﬁlter. For this assumption to be correct, the cut off size for the largest particle being elutriated
needs to be equal to or larger than the size of the ﬁnes produced.

(5.10)
The bubble-induced attrition rate is reported to be proportional to the excess gas velocity
(superﬁcial gas velocity u minus minimum ﬂuidization velocity um f ) [8, 193] and can be
calculated as [230]:
rb = cb
¡
u −um f

(5.11)
where rb is the bubble-induced attrition rate at steady-state and cb is a material speciﬁc steady-
state attrition rate constant for bubble-induced attrition. Owing to the unsteady behavior of
this attrition rate, a time-dependent and material-speciﬁc attrition rate parameter, cb(t), has
been deﬁned in order to increase the prediction range of the model not only under steady-
state conditions, but also during the initial unsteady-state period. This expression was further
divided by the minimum ﬂuidization velocity in order to incorporate the ﬂuidization number
rather than the excess gas velocity, as the latter is dependent on the material used.

Here, different values for the attrition rate parameter, cb(t), are obtained at different time
intervals. Since the parameter (u/um f −1) relates to the excess gas velocity, it is referred to
as a dimensionless gas velocity. The time dependency of the attrition rate parameter can be
taken into account using the same method reported by Gwyn [96] to give:
mloss
mbed
= Kptmex
(5.13)
The derivative of this equation is equivalent to the bubble-induced attrition rate, but is only
valid for a single gas ﬂow as it is reported. With the knowledge how the material speciﬁc
constant, Kp, and the exponent, mex change with gas velocity the model can be expanded.
rb(t) =

(5.14)
The Gwyn model was adapted in this study to include both the time and gas velocity of
bubble-induced attrition. To make this dependent on gas ﬂow requires incorporating the
excess gas ﬂow into the attrition rate constant, Kp, which can be implemented by setting
Kp = KCb

ﬂuidized bed column and ﬁlter for all attrition experiments is described in section 4.1.1, the
material properties and amounts of the analyzed γ-alumina and dolomite are summarized in
section 4.2. We can see from the results plotted in ﬁgure 5.1a that a ﬂuidization number of
2 produces about 18 g of ﬁnes in the ﬁrst 100 hours, with this increasing to 42 and 88 g with
ﬂuidization numbers of 5 and 8, respectively. The constant slope of these graphs above the
50 h mark suggests that near-steady-state conditions are achieved at this point. Meanwhile,
the plot in ﬁgure 5.1b shows that after 100 hours the mean particle attrition rate is less than
0.05 g h−1 when the ﬂuidization number is 2, but this increases to 0.25 and 0.4 g h−1 with
ﬂuidization numbers of 5 and 8, respectively. To test the reproducibility of these results, the
experiment with a ﬂuidization number of 2 was repeated, this time for 500 hours. Despite
the increase in total time, the amount of γ-alumina particles elutriated at the 100 hour mark
remained almost the same. There was, however, an apparent decrease in the steady-state rate
from 0.05 g h−1 after 100 hours to 0.005 g h−1 after 500 hours, as can be seen in ﬁgure 5.2. The
ﬂuctuation in the values obtained in the last few time intervals is most likely indicative of
an error in the gravimetric analysis of the ﬁlter, as the very small amount of ﬁnes collected
in these intervals means that even the slightest loss of material would have introduced a
signiﬁcant error. To ensure reliable attrition rate results from elutriation measurements, the
cut off size of the particles, which could be elutriated was calculated and found to be similar
to the maximum size of ﬁnes produced by attrition. However, for the calculation the most
conservative assumption was applied to calculate the maximum elutriated particle size; the
Stokes’ law was combined with the superﬁcial gas velocity in the ﬂuidized bed. In reality
bubble, eruption and gas jets are known to enable the elutriation of much larger particles.
Therefore, it is possible to assume that all produced ﬁnes are elutriated, which was later
conﬁrmed by measurements, see section 5.1.4.
The dolomite particles had a much higher attrition rate, with the results in ﬁgure 5.2a showing
that approximately 80 g of dolomite ﬁnes was collected in the ﬁlter after 500 hours for a
ﬂuidization number of 2. This is not entirely surprising, as dolomite has nearly twice the

compare the results with other attrition measurements from literature, the attrition rate (rb)
after 100 hours of ﬂuidization was calculated for both materials (table 5.1).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
The shape and abrasion resistance of the particles was also analyzed by SEM, with ﬁgure 5.3
showing the dolomite (Do) and γ-alumina (Al) in their as-received state. The width of the
white bars in each SEM image shows the scale. Note that the dolomite particles have some
sharp edges and cracks, and tend to be cylindrical rather than spherical in shape. Small
angular sheets and ﬁnes ranging in size from around 100 nm up to about 10 µm can also be
seen loosely adhered to the surfaces of larger particles. In contrast, the γ-alumina particles
are more potato-like in shape and lack any sharp edges or cracks. Nevertheless, the γ-alumina
particles also have ﬁne particles with a similar size range of anywhere between less than
100 nm to more than 10 µm, but notably these are more spherical in shape.
Figure 5.4 shows the dolomite and γ-alumina particles after 100 and 500 h in a bubbling bed
with ﬂuidization numbers of 2, 5 and 8, revealing no change in particle shape with either
material. The edges and cracks of the dolomite particles also remained very similar, with no
indication of any rounding of its edges. However, when more than one high-magniﬁcation
image of the ﬂuidized dolomite particles is analyzed, it becomes apparent that the largest
ﬁnes seen adhered to the surface of the coarse fresh particles have almost disappeared.
Consequently, after 100 h at a ﬂuidization number of 2, most ﬁnes are instead present within
the cracks and cavities of the dolomite particles. The difference between 100 and 500 h of
ﬂuidization, however, is not so signiﬁcant.

5.1. Particle attrition and elutriation
With the γ-alumina particles, there is again a clear difference in the amount of adhered ﬁnes
between the fresh material and after 100 h at a ﬂuidization number of 2. Similarly, the amount
and size of particles attached after 500 h remains much the same as after 100 h, with only
submicron particles still adhering (ﬁgure 5.4c and d). Increasing the ﬂuidization number to
5 (ﬁgure 5.4e) or 8 (ﬁgure 5.4f), causes the amount of ﬁnes sticking to the surface of coarse
particles after 100 hours to be reduced, especially in the case of the larger ﬁnes.
Analysis of the ﬁnes in the ﬁlter revealed that in the case of Do, the particle size for u/um f = 2 is
roughly between 40 nm and 20 µm. The γ-alumina ﬁnes, on the other hand, are even smaller at
between 20 nm and 20 µm. However, the γ-alumina had quite a large number of about 100 nm
ﬁnes sticking together, whereas most of the dolomite ﬁnes were in the micrometer range,
ﬁgure 5.5. This raises the question of whether 20 µm is the maximum size that can be elutriated
under the given ﬂuidization conditions, or whether it is in fact the maximum particle size
produced by attrition. To resolve this, the maximum particle size that can be elutriated under
the given superﬁcial gas velocities of the dolomite and γ-alumina particles was calculated
from a force balance around a single spherical particle. This found that even with an extremely
simpliﬁed worst-case scenario; which neglects such effects as the gas jets developed during
bubble eruption at the surface of the bed, the non-spherical shape of particles, initial impulse
etc.; the maximum size of the particles that can be considered to be elutriated for certain is
greater than 10 µm. When all other effects are taken into account, the particles size increases
considerably.
Using the knowledge gained through laser diffraction and SEM analysis that no large ﬁnes
accumulate in the bed and no larger particles are elutriated for increased gas velocity, it can be
safely said that most of the ﬁnes produced in the bubbling ﬂuidized bed are less than 20 µm in
size. Moreover, at steady-state operation at higher ﬂuidization numbers, one would expect
only a slight increase in particle size due to higher energetic particle collisions. However, even
if no breakage of the particles occurs, the gas velocity is still sufﬁciently high to elutriate any
ﬁne particles.
Electrostatic charge tests
The measurement of the electrostatic charge was conducted as described in section 4.3.4 in
two setups; a 14 cm Plexiglas® column (section 4.1.2) and in the column, which was used for
attrition experiments. It was observed that the particles had a tendency to acquire a negative
charge density, registering similar results of about −0.2 nC g−1 for the glass and the Plexiglas®
column. The resulting forces are analyzed in the subsequent section.
Forces acting during ﬂuidization
The order of magnitude of every force described in section 5.1.3 was theoretically calculated for
each different particle during ﬂuidization to obtain an overview of the range of each force. This

Figure 5.6: a) Forces acting on γ-alumina particles and (b) dolomite particles, for a ﬂuidization
number of 2
was intended to provide a tool to explain some of the phenomena observed during ﬂuidization
and the discrepancies between entrainment correlations [36], with the range of particle size
for both γ-alumina and dolomite particles assumed to be between 1 and 1000 microns, and
ﬂuidization numbers of 2, 5 and 8 used.
The calculated collision forces consider the interaction of individual spherical particles with a
ﬂat surface (Fc,pa−su). These collisions were assumed to be perpendicular, as this scenario
provides the highest force and therefore approximates the maximum collision that any given
particle can expect. The weight force (Fw) was calculated for individual particles, while
the drag force (Fd) was calculated for individual particle sizes by assuming a single particle
surrounded by ﬂuid. The maximum van der Waals forces were similarly calculated for a
spherical particle with no roughness, which provides the maximum value that can be expected.
However, when calculating the van der Waals forces, there were three possible scenarios that
needed to be considered:
• Pairs of particles of the same size (Fvdw,pa−pa), which in this case was varied between 1
and 1000 µm.
• An individual particle of 1−1000µm in size and a ﬂat surface (Fvdw,pa−su).
• An individual ﬁne particle (1 to 300 µm) and coarse (300 µm) particle (Fvdw,f i−co). The
latter size was selected on the basis that it approximates the average size of the γ-alumina
and dolomite.
Note again that the maximum possible electrostatic (Fe,max) was calculated for individual
particles, and this does not reﬂect the actual electrostatic force. The complete range of
calculated forces is shown in ﬁgure 5.6 as a function of particle size for γ-alumina and dolomite

Figure 5.7: Photographs showing the column during the ﬂuidization of γ-alumina
at a ﬂuidization number of 2. It is generally considered that the drag force on a spherical
particle needs to be greater than the combined sum of its weight and other interparticle forces
for it to be elutriated; however, it is clear that the maximum van der Waals force is greater
than the drag force across the whole range of particle sizes tested. This force also increases
at the same rate as drag when the particle size is increase; yet signiﬁcantly, the weight force
increases faster with particle size. This therefore explains the greater inﬂuence of adhesion
and agglomeration on ﬁner particles. The van der Waals force also appears to be weaker
with dolomite than with γ-alumina at all particle sizes, which is likely inﬂuenced by its lower
Hamaker constant and greater surface roughness, and would explain the lesser amount of
adhered ﬁnes on the bed particles.
The maximum van der Waals force between pairs of similar particles, and between particles
and walls, changes proportionally to the drag force across the whole particle size range. This
means that weakest van der Waals force is obtained with same size particle pairs, making
these much less likely to agglomerate. The van der Waals force between ﬁne and coarse
particles exhibits similar results to the interaction between a particle and ﬂat surface when
the ﬁne particle is 1 −30µm in size; but as the size of the ﬁnes is increased, this weakens
to a minimum when the two particles are of the same size. This would seem to suggest
that van der Waals adhesion is the dominant adhesion force in the case of ﬁne particles on
walls or coarse particles, which agrees well with the SEM observations of the γ-alumina and
dolomite particles. Of course once these ﬁne particles are released, they would tend to form
agglomerates rather than remain as individual ﬁne particles. Pictures taken of the column
during the ﬂuidization of γ-alumina (ﬁgure 5.7) clearly show ﬁne particles adhering to the
walls at ﬂuidization numbers of 2 and 5, and to the internal components of the column at all
ﬂuidization numbers.
Figure 5.8 shows the inﬂuence of surface roughness on van der Waals force, revealing that
with both materials there is a clear decrease in the van der Waals force as the roughness is
74

5.1. Particle attrition and elutriation
increased. For instance, a surface roughness of about 30 nm is sufﬁcient to reduce the van
der Waals force below the drag force across the entire range of particle sizes tested. With a
further increase in roughness to 1 µm, van der Waals forces become seemingly irrelevant as
they drop below the maximum electrostatic force. This maximum electrostatic force is also
consistently higher than the drag force across the entire range of particle sizes considered,
and becomes greater than the maximum van der Waals force at particle size of 100 µm for
both materials. However, please note that the electrostatic forces calculated on basis of the
charge measurements were between 4 and 10 orders of magnitude lower than the maximum
electrostatic force on a particle. It was therefore assumed that electrostatic forces have no
inﬂuence during ﬂuidization in comparison with the rest of the forces and particle adhesion
and agglomeration can really only be explained by van der Waals forces. However, it was also
shown that the measurement of the particle charge is required to reliably predict the attrition
and entrainment of ﬁnes, because the electrostatic forces can be of relevance.
Figure 5.9 shows the change in drag and collision forces when increasing the ﬂuidization
number; an increase in gas ﬂow increases both forces and reduces the inﬂuence of interparticle
adhesion. From the curvilinear shape of the van der Waals adhesion between ﬁne and coarse
particles relative to the shape of the drag force, it can be seen that a decrease in the size of
adhered ﬁnes means a greater drag force is needed to dislodge them. This, combined with the
aforementioned increase in van der Waals with ﬁner particles, mean that both the amount and
average size of ﬁnes adhering to coarse particles and walls or forming agglomerates should
decrease with an increase in gas ﬂow. This explains the decrease in the size and amount of the
ﬁnes seen in Figure 5.4e and f. Collision forces between particles and walls show the highest
results over the entire range of particle sizes considered, suggesting that certain collisions can
not only cause attrition, but also the release of adhered particles. Drag, collision and weight
forces are all slightly higher in the case of Do, which is to be expected given its higher density.
This, combined with the reduced inﬂuence of van der Waals forces, could explain its higher
elutriated mass.
On the basis of these results, it is proposed that attrition in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed is a
result of a balance between different phenomena. This includes the generation of ﬁnes
due to material abrasion and fragmentation, which is dependent on such parameters as
the gas velocity, material properties, particle size and reactor conﬁguration. The retention
of ﬁne particles inside the bed due to adhesion and agglomeration, through van der Waals
forces also needs to be considered, and this is inﬂuenced by the particle’s material (Hamaker
constant), size and surface roughness. Fine particles initially adhered to large particles or
surfaces as agglomerates can become free ﬁnes inside the bed due to collisions. Finally, there
is the elutriation of free ﬁnes which have a drag force large enough to remove them from the
freeboard. Bubble eruption can even eject larger particles into the freeboard with sufﬁcient
velocity to be elutriated.

5.1. Particle attrition and elutriation
Modeling
As the input data for the model, the experimentally measured amount of elutriated particles
from each gravimetric ﬁlter analysis was used to obtain the attrition rate (rb(t)/um f ) at each
time interval. The model therefore assumes that the elutriation rate is equivalent to the
attrition rate, though this does probably not hold true in the ﬁrst few hours of the experiment
due to the change in ﬁnes initially present in the bed, as shown by the SEM images. An attrition
rate parameter, cb(t), was obtained for each time interval by linearly ﬁtting the attrition rate
for each dimensionless excess gas ﬂow (u/um f −1).
For γ-alumina, experimental data corresponding to the 100 hour duration tests at ﬂuidization
numbers of 2, 5 and 8 was applied. In order to maximize the model prediction at longer
durations, further data points were obtained using the data generated during the 500 hour
test. Thus, in the time interval between 100 and 500 hours, the model is based only on the
attrition rate corresponding to a ﬂuidization numbers of 1 (no attrition) and 2, assuming that
it continues to increase linearly with excess gas velocity over this time period as well. The
linear dependence of the attrition rate, (rb(t)/um f ), on the excess gas velocity is demonstrated
in ﬁgure 5.10; a fact that becomes even more evident after 100 hours when a near-steady-state
condition is achieved. Finally, all of the attrition rate parameters (cb(t)) were ﬁtted over time
(eq. (5.16)) to obtain the model parameters KCb and mex. The exception here was the two
elutriation rate values that show a big deviation in ﬁgure 5.2b, which were not taken into
account when ﬁtting the model for γ-alumina. For the ﬁtting, the minimum squared relative
differences of the attrition rate parameters were minimized, thereby yielding a much better
description of the attrition rate over a long period of time than using the ﬁt obtained from
absolute differences.

For dolomite, the attrition rate was analyzed for only one gas velocity, and so each attrition
rate parameter value, cb(t), was obtained by a linear ﬁt of the data points corresponding
to a ﬂuidization number of 1 and 2. The model proposed for dolomite is therefore only an
approximation, making it necessary to obtain new data at higher ﬂuidization numbers for a
more complete model.
In ﬁgure 5.12, the attrition rate of γ-alumina predicted by the model is demonstrated to
correlate closely to the experimental results, especially at ﬂuidization numbers of 5 and
8. With a ﬂuidization number of 2 there is an initial deviation of about 50 %, but higher
ﬂuidization numbers produce a notably lower deviation. In the case of dolomite (ﬁgure 5.12b),
the predicted values all ﬁt well with the experimental results, deviating by less than 50 %. The
exponent mex in eq. (5.16) was found to be in the same range for both materials, leading to a

such as Young’s modulus and hardness also play a role in creating this difference.

Conclusions
This brief review of attrition and elutriation in ﬂuidized beds and the relevant test methods
has identiﬁed van der Waals forces as having the greatest inﬂuence on the adhesion and ag-
glomeration of ﬁnes for all setups with low particle charges and hence low electrostatic forces.
Although this is highly dependent on the particle properties and equipment, electrostatic
forces between particles are believed to have nearly no inﬂuence on the results since the
electrostatic charge measurements and related calculations show negligible forces. However,
the maximum electrostatic forces can be relevant for particle adhesion and hence for the

particle elutriation and attrition in ﬂuidized beds. A measurement of the electrostatic charge
is therefore recommended, especially, when the particle elutriation is studied.
The behavior of ﬁnes within a bubbling ﬂuidized bed is deﬁned by a balance between their
generation through attrition, retention by van der Waals adhesion forces and release/elutria-
tion due to drag. The complexity of this equilibrium, and the number of different variables by
which it is inﬂuenced, can partly explain the discrepancy between the different entrainment
correlations of past researchers. Since the maximum electrostatic force is in the same order of
magnitude as the maximum van der Waals forces, it is probably not the only the reason for
the huge discrepancies. A more critical analysis of the obtained results is recommended also
including particle roughness and phenomena, such as bubble eruption, gas jets and particle
clusters in the correlations for particle entrainment.

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
In the present study long-term (500 hour) attrition experiments with γ-alumina and dolomite
particles were conducted at different gas velocities; and on the basis of this, a model has been
proposed for particle attrition that is able to predict with reasonable accuracy the change in
the attrition rate of γ-alumina and dolomite over time as a function of the gas velocities. It
was ensured that no accumulation of ﬁnes occurs in the ﬂuidized beds by measurements and
calculations, as well as that particle charging can probably be neglected.

Abstract
To design bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors and study chemical reactions, the knowledge of
hydrodynamic properties, such as bubble size, rise velocity and hold-up is of importance.
Local measurements of those properties are valuable, but do not automatically reﬂect the
properties of the full bed. A method based on Bayes’ theorem is developed, which helps to
transform local bubble rise velocity measurements into a global result. The transformation
method was tested by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.
5.2.2
Introduction
Bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors are applied for gas solid reactions with high requirements
for heat and mass transfer. The measurement of the bubble rise velocity distribution (BRVD)
within a bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor is important for the characterization of the reactor
performance. It deﬁnes the residence time of the different gas bubbles, mixing behavior and
is therefore a key parameter for the conversion of reactants. The BRVD within the complete
reactor has to be known, to properly predict the chemical conversion, as under-estimated
bubble size and velocity for instance can lead to un-predicted reactant bypass. Additionally,
the BRVD is needed for the development and validation of detailed computer models for
efﬁcient scale-up of ﬂuidized bed reactors [206].
Different methods have been established to measure the BRVD, ranging from local and intru-
sive capacitance and optical probe measurements [243, 31] to three-dimensional techniques
such as tomography [59, 197, 109, 179, 27]. Up to now, local capacitance and optical probe
measurements are still the method of choice, because they are cheap and easy to apply.
However, the local measurements have to be back transformed into a global result to predict
the correct bubble rise velocity (BRV) of the full bed, whereupon global means every bubble
rising in the ﬂuidized bed is considered. Otherwise, the global number-weighted mean BRV of
the bed is signiﬁcantly overestimated by the local measurements, because large and therefore,
according to different bubble rise velocity correlations, fast bubbles are more likely pierced by
a local probe, compared to small and therefore slow bubbles.
In a previous work [209], the measurement of the local chord-length was analyzed. The local
chord-length is usually smaller than the bubble diameter, however it was demonstrated for
different setups and assumptions that the high probability to pierce a large bubble (small
probability to pierce a small one) approximately counterbalances the smaller chord-length.
Therewith, the locally measured mean chord-length matches approximately the mean bubble

diameter of all bubbles present in the bed. However, for the mean BRV no counteracting effect
occurs; and the mean BRV is overestimated due to different pierce probabilities. Both, the
mean and the whole distribution are biased.
The objective is to pinpoint the error sources and to transform the local velocity measurements
into a global result. To this end, Monte Carlo simulations on a bubbling ﬂuidized bed
are conducted, and a mathematical backward transformation based on Bayes’ theorem
is proposed to transform the local bubble rise velocity into a global one. Furthermore, a
sensitivity study to investigate the inﬂuence of the assumptions made for the mathematical
backward transformation is conducted.
5.2.3
Model and Methodology
A Monte Carlo model was developed to compare the local mean BRV with the mean BRV
present in the whole cylindrical ﬂuidized bed. The model assumptions are that a homogeneous
spatial distribution of spherical bubbles exists in the bed, and that the bubble size distribution
of a real bed can be represented using a Gamma or Rayleigh distribution, as shown in [40,
85]. Three different means: the number, diameter and surface-weighted mean are compared
to the detected results of a perfectly working local, virtual probe. The virtual probe detects
every bubble, its chord-length as well as the BRV at the tip. In the Monte Carlo model, ﬁrst a
bubble size distribution is deﬁned using eq. (5.17) (Gamma distribution) or eq. (5.18) (Rayleigh
distribution), where µ is the Rayleigh distribution parameter, q and λ are the shape parameter
and scale factor of the Gamma distribution. A ﬁxed number of bubbles is assigned to the
distributions.

Out of the respective distribution, the Monte Carlo model randomly selects a single bubble
with deﬁned size, to rise in a straight line in axial direction of the cylindrical ﬂuidized bed. The
starting point of this bubble is randomly selected on the cross-sectional area, such that the
complete bubble is within the reactor. No further wall effects are taken into account in the
simulation. An example of such a bubble distribution in a similar simulation is given in [209].
The corresponding bubble rise velocity is assigned to the bubble diameter according to the
correlation of Davidson and Harrison applicable for a single bubble, eq. (5.19).

In the remainder we will refer to the factor 0.711 as the "prefactor", the BRVs and diameters
are called the simulated data. The virtual, local probe tip is placed in the centerline of the
tubular reactor with 145mm in diameter. The bubble rise velocity and chord-length detected
at the tip of the probe is equal to the simulated bubble rise velocity and chord-length present
at this point. No detection error is considered in the model, which means that the detected
and simulated BRV is equal. The data of the virtual probe is in the following called the locally
detected data.
In ﬁgure 5.13a, an example of nine randomly simulated bubbles and the probe is shown
(top-view). Apparently, only one out of nine bubbles (i.e., the largest bubble) is pierced by
the probe. As the bubbles are spherical, the detected chord-length of this pierced bubble is
represented as a dotted line between two triangles in ﬁgure 5.13b.

Results and Discussion
Comparison of local and global bubble rise velocity
In ﬁgure 5.14, all locally detected bubble rise velocities are plotted over the detected chord-
length (blue circles). Most of the blue circles are broadly scattered above the full line repre-
senting the Davidson and Harrison correlation (eq. (5.19)), which was used for the simulation
of the global BRV.

was used for the
simulation
All blue circles in ﬁgure 5.14 lie on the left side of the Davison and Harrison correlation,
because the chord-length is usually smaller than the bubble diameter. Figure 5.14 shows
further that more than a constant factor is needed to shift the detected mean BRV to the right
that it matches the Davidson and Harrison correlation eq. (5.19). The dashed line, which
illustrates the detected local mean BRV, largely overestimates the simulated mean BRV for
a given bubble diameter, especially for smaller bubbles. With increased bubble size the
difference between both is approaching zero, because the possible pierce positions are shifted
towards the centerline of the bubbles. If a correlation would have been developed based on
the locally detected BRV data, the global BRV would be considerably overestimated, because
the BRV would be connected to the measured chord-length, which is usually smaller.
To overcome the problem of correlating the BRV to the detected chord-length more sophis-
ticated four-point probes were developed, which are able to correlate the measured three-
dimensional BRV to the corresponding bubble size [94, 160]. However, applying such a four
point probe, the locally measured number-weighted mean BRV would still be larger than the
simulated number-weighted mean BRV present in the bed, which is described in the next
section in more details.
In ﬁgure 5.14, additionally the different number-weighted mean BRVs are depicted: ﬁrst the
locally detected mean BRV (diamond - mean detected), which is based on all bubbles hitting
the probe shown as blue circles. Second, the global mean BRV of all simulated bubbles (green

5.2. Monte Carlo simulation
circle - mean simulated, number-weighted) and third the corrected (see section 5.2.4) mean
BRV (black cross) are depicted.
When the number-weighted mean BRV of all locally detected bubbles is compared to the
global simulated BRV, the local measurement largely overestimates the simulated bubble rise
velocity for the underlying Gamma distribution. In addition, the detected mean chord-length
is a little bit smaller than the mean bubble size simulated. The change in mean chord-length
is discussed in all details by [209], whereas the changes in the mean BRV are discussed and
corrected in the following.
In ﬁgure 5.15a, the relative differences between the detected local and simulated global
mean BRV are plotted as a function of the simulated global mean bubble diameter. The
simulated global mean bubble diameter is changed by using different shape and scale factors
for the underlying Gamma distribution in the Monte Carlo model. For visualization, several
Gamma distributions for different shape factors are plotted in ﬁgure 5.15b and distributions
for different scale factors in ﬁgure 5.15c.
The set of curves in ﬁgure 5.15a depicts that the local detected mean overestimates the
simulated global mean BRV between 5 and 40 %, depending on the chosen bubble size
distribution. For systems of large bubbles, where the mean bubble size is exceeding the
half of the reactor diameter (145 mm), the difference is approaching zero, which is e.g. the case
for slugging. Large bubbles however are normally avoided in ﬂuidized bed reactors, because
usually the available exchange surface between bubble and dense phase shall be maximized to
increase mass transfer and chemical conversion [67, 212]. For small bubble sizes the relative
differences are as high as 40 % as can be seen in ﬁgure 5.15a.
To explain why the locally detected mean BRV is larger than the mean BRV of the bed, one
has to look at the pierce probability of a bubble with known size (eq. (5.21)). The pierce
probability is increased to unity with increased bubble size, which means larger bubbles are
more probably pierced than small ones. Hence, in the analyzed system, where the BRV is
assumed to be proportional to the square root of the bubble size, the mean bubble rise velocity
is overestimated. A similar result would be obtained, if e.g. the correlation of Clift and Grace
[41] is taken for the simulation of the bubble rise velocity in the bed. More general, the locally
detected mean is not equal to the global mean, for all systems where the bubble rise velocity is
depending on the bubble size, or more general for all systems where a dependeny between
particle/bubble size and the velocity exists.
Transformation of the local mean bubble rise velocity and distribution to a global result
As seen in ﬁgure 5.15, the locally detected mean value of the BRV has to be corrected to
guarantee an error smaller than 40 %, if the bubbles rise with a velocity similar to the Davidson
and Harrison correlation eq. (5.19). In the following, a mathematical correction of the locally
detected data based on the Bayes’ theorem on conditional probability is proposed, see

eq. (5.20). This mathematical transformation in eq. (5.20) helps to calculate the global BRV
from the local measurements, which means all blue circles in ﬁgure 5.14 are shifted to the
right by the mathematical back transformation.
The ﬁrst assumption for the back transformation is that the BRV can be expressed as a function
of the bubble diameter. The impact of a wrong BRV assumption on the back transformation is
studied by means of a sensitivity analysis, see section 3.3. The detected BRV has to be linked to
the bubble size, because the probability to pierce a bubble can only be calculated as a function
of the bubble diameter, eq. (5.21).
Using Bayes’ theorem, we can connect the overall bubble size distribution in the bed Pbed,
including the missed bubbles, to the bubble distribution at the probe tip Ppr , which is detected
(eq. (5.20)).

This connection can be made, because the probability to pierce a bubble of known size db, (i.e.,
P (X = 0|db)), in the center of the reactor can be calculated from the geometrical relationship,
eq. (5.21). The probability to pierce a large bubble increases to unity as soon as the bubble
diameter db reaches half the reactor diameter Dreac, when the probe tip is placed in the

For all other radial positions of the probe tip, the pierce probability can also be derived. The
graph in ﬁgure 5.16 maps the pierce probability as a function of radial probe position and
diameter for a ﬂuidized bed with 14.5 cm in diameter. Again the probability increases to unity
as soon as the bubble diameter is exceeding the maximum free space between probe tip and
reactor wall. Wall effects like e.g. a change in BRV close to the walls are not considered in
correction. Important to note is, that a constant bubble size distribution at a certain cross-
section does not imply an equal distribution of the number of bubbles per time over the
cross-section. E.g. in the center of the bed a larger number of bubbles can be present.
In ﬁgure 5.17a, the locally detected centerline BRVD is compared to the global simulated
(pdf input) and corrected BRVD. For the local measurement the complete BRVD is shifted
to the right, towards larger values of the BRV. The corrected BRVD and mean value nearly

locally detected BRVD, because one could assume a local measurement is e.g. dependent
on the cross-sectional area of a bubble. However, neither the diameter nor surface-weighted
mean and distribution are matching the locally detected bubble rise velocity distribution;
the discrepancy with respect to the diameter weighted and or surface weighted BRVD is even
larger. A similar picture is obtained, when the Rayleigh distribution function is used for the
bubble size.
Sensitivity of the bubble rise velocity transformation
To transform the local bubble rise velocity into a global result the bubble size has to be
expressed as a function of the bubble rise velocity. However, it is questionable how accurate
the correlation between bubble size and rise velocity needs to be known beforehand for the
back transformation. In the following, a sensitivity analysis is performed to study the impact
of a wrong correlation on the results obtained. For the back transformation it is assumed
that the bubble diameter can roughly be expressed as a function of the bubble rise velocity
according to the Davidson and Harrison formula (eq. (5.19)).
In ﬁgure 5.18, the relative difference of the locally detected number-weighted mean to the
global mean BRV is plotted as a chain line. The relative difference of the corrected mean to the
global mean BRV is plotted as a full line. Different prefactors have been used in eq. (5.19) to
vary the simulated BRV in the Monte Carlo model. An increased prefactor in the simulation
corresponds to a larger simulated bubble rise velocity for the same bubble size. As the exact
BRV in a real ﬂuidized bed is unknown, the simulated BRV was varied in a wide range with
the help of the prefactor. The prefactor was changed between 0.05 and 3.5, to ensure that the
maximum and minimum physically meaningful BRV is covered [2, 125].

0.711; right: 3. The chain line depicts the mean error made without correction.
For the back transformation in ﬁgure 5.18a, the original prefactor of 0.711 was assumed in
the Davidson and Harrison formula, on the right hand side in ﬁgure 5.18b a prefactor of 3.0.
The depicted error bars are ±1 standard deviation and result from the variation of the shape
factor (3 to 10) and scale factor (0.3 to 1) of the Gamma function used for the calculation of the
bubble size distribution. To get more realistic results, also the minimal detectable bubble size
of the probes was set to 0.5 cm.
In ﬁgure 5.18, the error of the mean corrected is approaching zero for the cases were the
coefﬁcient of the simulated BRV and the assumed bubble size/glsbrv correlation for back
transformation are equal. In these cases, the probability to hit a bubble can be exactly
expressed as a function of the BRV. As described beforehand, the BRVD of the whole bed
can then be recalculated from the detected centerline BRVD, because the probability function
to pierce a bubble with a certain size is known.
If the BRV assumption for the back transformation underestimates the simulated BRV, the
relative error of the mean corrected is approaching the error made in the uncorrected mean,
because only little or no correction is made. The reason is that the calculated bubble size
distribution is shifted towards larger bubbles. Therefore, more bubbles are exceeding the
critical diameter of Dreac/2 above which the probability to pierce a bubble is unity and hence
no correction is made for an underestimated BRV.
Interestingly, the error made in the corrected result is about 3 % as long as the BRV assumed
for the back transformation is larger than the BRV simulated (ﬁgure 5.18b). Maybe the ﬁnal
result could be additionally corrected with a constant of approximately 0.97 in those cases, to
compensate the slight increase. To further discuss the inﬂuence of the bubble rise velocity
assumption on the results of the back transformation two additional cases can be analyzed.

5.2. Monte Carlo simulation
• Case 1: the mean bubble diameter is below the critical diameter (ﬁgure 5.19)
• Case 2: the mean bubble diameter is above the critical bubble diameter (ﬁgure 5.20)
An example for case 1 is depicted in ﬁgure 5.19. The simulated bubble size distribution (pdf
for input) is clearly below the critical diameter in (ﬁgure 5.19a). The chosen prefactor for
the back transformation is 3.0, for the simulated BRV the prefactor is 0.711 according to the
Harrison and Davidson formula. The bubble size distribution calculated from the local BRV
measurement is shifted to the left, however, still the mean and the whole distribution function
of the BRV can be properly corrected, shown on the right hand side in ﬁgure 5.19b. It seems
like even though the BRV is overestimated, the back transformation is stable. Therefore, it
seems reasonable to overestimate the BRV correlation for the backward transformation as
long as the bubble sizes is below the critical diameter Dreac/2. The error made is consequently
decreased to approximately 3 %, shown in Figure 6. As [209] has shown, the mean of the
detected chord-length is approximately the mean of the bubble size distribution, therefore
one has a ﬁrst hint, whether the mean bubble size is below the critical diameter Dreac/2 or
not.
For the second case ﬁgure 5.20, where the mean of the bubble size is above the critical
diameter one should avoid overestimating the BRV correlation for the back transformation
and a prefactor of 0.711 should be chosen. The reason is, that for large bubbles exceeding
the critical diameter Dreac/2, combined with an overestimated BRV, it may happen that the
bubble size distribution calculated is on the left hand side of the critical diameter and the
bubble size distribution simulated on the right hand side of the critical diameter, as depicted
in ﬁgure 5.20. In fact, hardly any correction is needed, because most of the bubbles are
larger than the critical diameter Dreac/2. If a correction is made anyway, it results in an even
worse mean value and BRVD. Again, the mean of the detected chord-length can be taken to
scrutinize whether the mean bubble size in the reactor is above the critical diameter Dreac/2
or not. This is however mainly important in lab scale experiments, because in industrial sized
ﬂuidized bed reactors the bubble diameter is assumed to be usually smaller than the half of
the reactor diameter, resulting in a properly working correction or large errors for uncorrected
measurements.
5.2.5
Conclusions
The objective of this Monte Carlo simulation was to pinpoint the difﬁculties with local bubble
rise velocity measurements and to develop a method to transform the local measurements into
a global result, assuming that a correlation between bubble size and velocity exists. To this end,
the BRV in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed was simulated using a Monte Carlo model. It was shown
that both the mean and the whole bubble rise velocity distribution of the local measurement
signiﬁcantly differ from the global results without back transformation. Especially for small
bubble sizes and broad distributions, the error made can be in the region of 30 to 40 %.
91

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
The detected local mean BRV as well as the local BRVD can be transformed to a global result,
independent of the bubble size distribution and the starting point, assuming a correlation
between bubble size and velocity exists and wall effects can be neglected. This transformation
can be made with the Bayes’ theorem on conditional probability. It seems to be reasonable
to overestimate the BRV for the backward transformation to reach an error of approximately
3 %, as long as the critical diameter dreac/2 is clearly above the mean bubble size. For all
cases, where the most bubbles diameters are exceeding the critical diameter, deﬁned as the
maximum distance between probe tip and reactor wall, fairly no correction is needed. A
sensitivity study was conducted to investigate the inﬂuence of the BRV assumption made on
the mathematical backward transformation and the results obtained.
The concept of the back transformation seems to be applicable for all situations, where the
object to be measured is signiﬁcantly bigger than the local measurement area and rises with
a velocity, which is a function of the object size. Local does not necessarily corresponds to
a point measurement, it can e.g. also be a line measurement in a two-dimensional plane.
Relevant systems might be bubble columns, draft tubes, slurry tanks and ﬂuidized beds.
The mathematical back transformation can be applied for all systems with known pierce
probability.

Abstract
An ultra-fast X-ray tomographic scanner is applied to study the hydrodynamics in a bubbling
ﬂuidized bed with and without vertical internals (e.g., heat exchanger tubes). The objective
of this study is to understand the inﬂuence of vertical internals on hydrodynamic properties
such as bubble volume, size and velocity and to provide measurement data for the design
and scale-up of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical internals. With these
new measurements, correlations of bubble properties can be developed to reliably scale-up
bubbling ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals. For the investigated reactor with Geldart A/B
particles, no relation between bubble size and velocity was observed for individual bubbles;
smaller bubbles tend to rise with higher velocities. A signiﬁcant reduction in bubble size
and sharpening of the bubble size distribution was generally obtained for a bed with vertical
internals.
5.3.2
Introduction
Conversion and yield in catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors are often controlled by the
mass transfer between the bubble and dense phase [16]. To design and reliably scale-up
this type of reactor or to improve the computer models that describe it, the hydrodynamic
properties with and without immersed vertical internals (e.g., heat exchanger tubes) must be
measured and understood.
In the literature, a large amount of measurement data and correlations are available that
describe the hydrodynamics of bubbling ﬂuidized beds without vertical internals [41, 52, 125].
Those correlations generally provide mean values of bubble size, velocity and hold-up and
are used for the development of computer models, such as the two-phase model [232, 139].
To describe the hydrodynamic properties of bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical
internals, none of the existing correlations seem appropriate, and reliable data is rarely found
in the open literature [208]. Additionally, because these bubble correlations are frequently
used to validate complex computational ﬂuid dynamic models, a more quantitative and
critical assessment would be of great value.
X-ray tomography can be applied to accommodate the need of more quantitative results with
high-resolution measurements. Both spatial and temporal resolution of these systems have
improved in recent years. Today, the ﬂow within ﬂuidized beds can be visualized with high
spatial resolution, as shown by [99, 22, 69, 236]. Another measurement technique suitable to
visualize the ﬂow within ﬂuidized beds is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique

ﬂuidized bed columns or similar systems have been successfully investigated using the same
X-ray apparatus [27, 211, 194].
Correlations of bubble volume, size and rise velocity shall be developed. The aim of this work
is to report detailed measurement data for designing catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors
with vertical heat exchanger tubes of different scales.

Experimental
The experimental apparatus and employed measurement devices and particles were used for
several experiments and are therefore separately explained. Details about the X-ray apparatus
are provided in sections 3.1 and 4.3.1, about the image reconstruction technique in section 3.2
and about the optical probes in sections 3.3 and 4.3.2. The employed 14 cm column and its
dimensions are described in section 4.1.2, the characterization of the employed γ-alumina
powder is reported in section 4.2.
5.3.4
Results and Discussion
The hydrodynamic properties of the ﬂuidized bed column are analyzed with and without
vertical internals. To accomplish this, an extensive series of measurements was conducted,
analyzing different heights, gas velocities and radial positions depicted in table 5.3. Different
hydrodynamic properties such as bubble volume, size and rise velocity are consecutively
presented. Additionally, the correlation between bubble size and velocity for single bubbles is
scrutinized based on the measurement results. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to
study the inﬂuence of different settings in image reconstruction on the results obtained.
Bubble volume
The bubble volume can be directly derived from the reconstructed X-ray tomographic images;
no further assumptions or calculations are needed as soon as a speciﬁc threshold for the
phase change between the bubble and dense phase is chosen. A quasi three-dimensional
visualization of the gas bubbles within the ﬂuidized bed is presented in ﬁgure 5.21. This

distributor plate is depicted in ﬁgure 5.22. Again, a gas velocity ratio of u/um f = 1.5 and 3 is
analyzed. The averaged bubble volume is found to increase in both cases, probably due to
bubble coalescence. The frequency of bubble occurrence is reduced approximately by a factor
of two at the second position at both gas velocity ratios.
In ﬁgure 5.23, the bubbles in a column with vertical internals are depicted. The gas velocity
ratio is 3 for both measurements. A height of 28.0 cm (ﬁgure 5.23a) and 43.0 cm (ﬁgure 5.23b)
above the distributor plate is depicted. It seems that the vertical internals inhibit the horizontal
movement of the bubbles. The bubbles appear marginally rougher and elongated, which
increases the available bubble surface per volume for the mass transfer between the bubble
and dense phase. Some vertical internals are completely surrounded by larger bubbles. The
bubble volume, however, decreases compared with the reactor without vertical internals. At
an increased measurement height, bubble volume is also increased, but bubble coalescence
seems to occur primarily between bubbles that are located above each other. Even at a
measurement height of 43.0 cm above the distributor plate, some bubbles are kept horizontally

separated by the vertical internals. Similar to the measurements without vertical internals,
bubble frequency decreases with increasing measurement height.
In ﬁgure 5.24, the measured number-weighted mean of bubble volumes for all X-ray mea-
surements given in table 5.3 are summarized. To compare the results in the reactor without
vertical internals, a well-known bubble size correlation [113] was used to calculate bubble
volumes; these results are additionally plotted in ﬁgure 5.24. Between 60 and 1300 bubbles
have been linked for each of the different measurements. For all measurements with and
without internals, the standard error of the mean is depicted in ﬁgure 5.24; however, the error
bars fall behind the markers because they are too small.
All measured data points seem to oscillate slightly, which is similar to what was seen in other
studies [236]. This oscillation may be caused by bubble coalescence at certain positions in the
bed and slugging at high gas velocity ratios and positions.
The ﬁrst result for all measurements without vertical internals is; the correlation underesti-
mates the measured bubble volumes by approximately 50 %. This result is nearly independent
of the measurement position and gas velocity. As postulated by [113], most previously
published bubble size correlations overestimated bubble size due to the lack of a bubble
splitting mechanism. As shown in the detailed measurement data for Geldart A/B particles,
this statement is likely not true; however, one should keep in mind that an error of 50 % in
bubble volume corresponds to an error of about 14 % in bubble diameter.
Once vertical internals were installed, the mean bubble volume decreased by 60 %; this is
nearly independent of the measurement height and ﬂuidization number. For a ﬂuidization

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
number of 1.5, no bubbles were observed at higher positions in the bed with vertical internals.
Possible explanations for this phenomenon include that the larger wall surface increases the
friction and thereby inhibits proper ﬂuidization for small gas velocities, and that the required
bubble volumes for these measurements were near the detection limit. However, the column
with employed vertical internals was still ﬂuidized at the minimum ﬂuidization conditions.
Bubble size
The bubble diameter is often described as one of the most important parameters in a bubbling
ﬂuidized bed [178, 9] because it is used to predict important parameters such as mass transfer,
particle circulation, heat transfer, elutriation of ﬁnes and also bubble rise velocity, which is
consecutively discussed in section 5.3.4.
However, in contrast to the bubble volume, different deﬁnitions of the bubble diameter are
found in the literature: the equivalent spherical bubble diameter, which is often used in open
literature is used to develop bubble rise velocity correlations; and the hydraulic diameter
(deﬁned in section 2.3, eq. (2.4)), which is usually applied for heat transfer calculations in
systems with noncircular shapes. In this study, we focus on the equivalent spherical bubble
diameter because it can be easily compared with the published data from the open literature
and on the hydraulic bubble diameter, which considers the noncircular shape of bubbles in
the bed with the heat exchanger tubes used in this study.
In ﬁgures 5.25a and 5.25c, the number-weighted mean equivalent bubble diameter, which is
deﬁned in section 2.3, is compared with the bubble size correlation reported by [113] for all
X-ray measurements without vertical internals, as summarized in table 5.3. For measurements
with and without internals, the standard error of the mean is shown in ﬁgure 5.25a; however,
the error bars fall behind the markers because they are too small.
The equivalent bubble diameter calculated by the correlation of Horio and Nonaka underesti-
mates the measured equivalent bubble diameter without internals by approximately 14 % for
all analyzed gas velocities and heights. For the reactor with vertical internals, the equivalent
bubble diameter reduces by 16 % compared with the measurement without vertical internals,
which is similar to the data previously reported based on pressure ﬂuctuation measurements
(PFM) [208]. Bubble diameters predicted by the correlation of Horio and Nonaka are located
between the measurements with and without vertical internals.
In ﬁgures 5.25b and 5.25d, the hydraulic number-weighted mean bubble diameter with
and without vertical internals is plotted as a function of measurement height for different
gas velocities. The mean hydraulic bubble diameter with internals was shown to decrease
from between 2 and 8 cm (without internals) towards values between 1.5 and 2.5 cm. The
hydraulic diameter of the bubbles with immersed vertical internals increased only marginally
with increasing measurement height, compared with the measurements without internals

ment compared with that of [113] with internals (ﬁlled marker) and without internals (yellow
marker)
(ﬁgures 5.25b and 5.25d). Gas velocity is also shown to have no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
hydraulic diameter when vertical internals are applied.
The relatively constant hydraulic diameter is advantageous for the design and scale-up of
catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds because the mass transfer between the bubble and dense
phase often limits the overall reaction rate [168]. For a constant small bubble diameter, the
surface of the interphase between the bubble and dense phase is large and the mass transfer is
easier to calculate. As also stated by [176, 246], accurate modeling of the bed becomes possible
only when the assumed bubble size is realistic, which is easily accomplished with constant
values.
In ﬁgures 5.26 and 5.27 different bubble size histograms are depicted for heights of 17.9 cm,
28.0 cm, 38.0 cm and 48.1 cm above the distributor and a gas velocity ratio of u/um f = 3. The
histograms without vertical internals show a broad distribution that is nearly independent of
99

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
the hydraulic or equivalent bubble diameters. The distribution without internals is generally
broadened and shifted to the right with increasing height. The total number of bubbles is
decreases signiﬁcantly with measurement height in the bed.
With the vertical internals present, a sharp bubble size distribution is observed for the hy-
draulic bubble diameter. Most bubbles are only between 1 and 4 cm in diameter. Additionally,
the equivalent bubble diameter distribution is skewed to the left, is less broad than when the
internals are not present. The equivalent bubble diameter is roughly between 2 and 6 cm for
the measurements at 17.9 cm and 28.0 cm, roughly between 2 and 8 cm for the measurement at
38 cm and roughly between 2 and 11 cm for the measurement at 48.1 cm above the distributor
plate. The minimum detectable equivalent bubble diameter is set to 2 cm, which explains the
edge of the distribution with used vertical internals. This edge will be analyzed in more details
within the sensitivity analysis.
The effect of different bubble size distributions is particularly important for catalytic bubbling
ﬂuidized beds. For these beds, chemistry or mass transfer between the bubble and dense
phase can limit the overall reaction rate, dependent on temperature. For mass-transfer-limited
processes, the surface-to-volume ratio of a bubble is quite relevant and usually decreases with
increasing size; hence, a constant small hydraulic bubble diameter, which was measured with
vertical internals, is advantageous. With such a sharp bubble size distribution, the usage of
simple models may become possible; these models may only use a single bubble rise velocity
and size at a given bed height. For many of these simple models, such as the well-known
two-phase models, the mean equivalent bubble diameter is used in calculations; however, this
does not seem to be the most adequate parameter for the calculation of exchange surfaces
between the bubble and dense phase.
The reasons for this are plentiful. For mass-transfer-limited reactions in bubbling ﬂuidized
beds with less than 100 % conversion, only larger bubbles with small surface-to-volume ratios
are expected to inﬂuence the results; small bubbles, however, are expected to equilibrate with
their surroundings quickly. This must be considered for bubbling ﬂuidized beds with and
without internals. Additionally, for beds with immersed internals, the usage of equivalent
diameter for the calculation of an exchange area is questionable due to the changes in bubble
shape and piercing of bubbles. Using hydraulic diameter for the calculations might therefore
be more appropriate. Different possibilities are discussed in section 5.3.4.
To compare the results without vertical internals, additional optical probe measurements
were performed. For these measurements, the probe tip was placed in the centerline of the
reactor. The number-weighted mean chord-length measured for the same gas velocities are
shown in ﬁgure 5.28; again the Horio Nonaka correlation is plotted on the same graph for
comparison. The correlation of bubble size seems to agree well with the measured mean
chord-length in a bed without internals for gas velocity ratios of u/um f = 1.5 and 3. At 21 cm
above the distributor plate, the measured mean chord-length was smaller compared with the

Figure 5.28: Horio-Nonaka correlation for bubble size compared with the average chord-length
measured with optical probes in the ﬂuidized bed without internals
correlation. In the higher regions at higher gas velocities, the measured chord-length was
larger than the correlation; for lower gas velocities, it was smaller.
These results can be reasonably explained. The shape of the bubbles becomes important with
optical probe measurements; a ﬂattened bubble shape leads to a decrease in the measured
chord-length compared with the hydraulic or equivalent bubble diameter, as shown in
ﬁgure 5.28. Additionally, it is known that bubbles are more frequently located in the center of
the column in the upper regions of the bed, and one expects a large chord-length in the center;
in the lower regions, the probability distribution of the bubble occurrence is known to have
a maximum left and right of the centerline, which should therefore decrease the measured
bubble size in the centerline.
Bubble rise velocity
The bubble rise velocity is important in bubbling ﬂuidized beds because it inﬂuences the
residence time, mass and heat transfers. Whenever the mass transfer between the bubble
and dense phase controls the reaction, fast bubbles are assumed to have a larger inﬂuence on
the conversion and yield of a catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor than slower ones due
to shorter residence times of the bubbles within the bed. In ﬁgures 5.29a and 5.29b, X-ray
measurements of the mean BRV are presented. For some measurement points at a gas velocity
ratio of 3.8 and 4 with and without vertical internals, the standard error of the mean can be
seen (ﬁgure 5.29b), however, for the most measurements the error bars fall behind the markers
because they are too small. The maximum standard error of the mean was 0.02 m s−1 for all
measurements. For comparison with the results of the reactor without vertical internals, the
Horio Nonaka correlation was applied to calculate the bubble diameters [113]. Thereafter,

While the correlation predicts an increase in bubble rise velocity for increasing gas velocities
and measurement height, the measured bubble rise velocity reached a maximum for u/um f =
3 and 4 with and without internals at approximately 28.0 – 38.0 cm. The maximum mean
bubble rise velocity measured was approximately 0.75 m s−1 for the highest gas velocity with
and without internals. For gas velocity ratios below 3, the measured mean bubble rise velocity
always increased with increasing bed height, as expected.
For most analyzed gas velocities and measurement positions, a decrease of nearly 20 % in the
rise velocity was measured when internals were applied. For the largest analyzed gas velocity
and measurement heights above 28.0 cm, slugging likely occurred, which could explain the
unexpected decrease in BRV for u/um f = 4.
The slugging initiation was studied by different researchers in beds without vertical internals;
the onset of slugging was assumed to start in reactors without vertical internals if the equivalent
bubble diameter exceeded 50 % of the reactor diameter [13]. Other authors predicted slugging
initiation to start if the equivalent bubble diameter exceeded 60 % [114] or 2/3 of the bed
diameter [144]. For a similar apparatus, with vertical internals 1.5 cm in diameter and a bed
diameter of 14.5 cm with the same particles, we visually observed and measured the onset of
slugging with optical probes [168]. If the mean chord-length exceeded 2/3 of the total bed

Figure 5.30: Number-weighted mean bubble rise velocities measured with optical probes in
the centerline without internals
diameter, slugging had occurred; thus, the slugging criterion was a mean chord-length of
9.3 cm in this present case.
To further analyze the results, the bubble rise velocity was locally measured by optical probes
in the centerline of the bed without vertical internals (ﬁgure 5.30). The BRV measured by
optical probes was found to be marginally smaller than the one measured by X-ray. For the
gas velocity ratios of u/um f = 1.5 and 3, the measured bubble rise velocity was found to be
in agreement with the correlation, which underpredicted the X-ray results. For a gas velocity
ratio of 2, we measured a larger increase in the rise velocity with height. Additionally, for a
gas velocity ratio of u/um f = 4, we measured roughly the same velocity at a height of 0.2 and
0.4 m, which might again be explained by the onset of slugging.
Implementation of measurement data in a two-phase model
The detailed measurement data of the bubble size and rise velocity can be directly used in
existing two-phase models (one dimensional models), refer to [139] for information about
the model used for the methanation reaction. The easiest way to accommodate the new
measurement data is to replace the old correlations for the averaged bubble rise velocity and
equivalent bubble diameter with correlations from the new measurement data for the rise
velocity in axial direction and the hydraulic bubble diameter, which consider the vertical heat
exchanger tubes used in the bubbling ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor (see section 5.5).
An even more promising solution would be, to use not only a single averaged bubble size for
every incremental height in the bed, but to make use of the known bubble size distribution
to calculate the available exchange area per bubble volume. This could be accomplished by
dividing the bubble phase in the two-phase model into several parallel phases, consecutively
refereed to as parallel sections. Since the total bubble hold-up is known (section 5.4), and the
fraction of smaller and larger bubbles is given from the measured equivalent bubble diameter
104

5.3. X-ray results with and without vertical tubes
distribution, the available surface area per bubble volume can be calculated based on the
distribution of the hydraulic diameter for each individual section.
The gas composition in the next incremental step (height in the ﬂuidized bed) can either be
calculated for every section individually and the gases are consecutively mixed downstream
the bed, or there is a certain gas exchange between the different sections deﬁned at each
incremental bed height, accounting for bubble coalescence and splitting.
The measured bubble rise velocity distribution could be implemented in a similar way. Every
individual section of the bubble size could be split in subsections each rising with a different
bubble rise velocity. Similar as for the bubble size, a certain gas exchange rate with the
surrounding sections could be deﬁned at each height in the bed, or the gas could be mixed
downstream the bubbling ﬂuidized bed (BFB) reactor. The answer to this question is probably
given as soon as the measured gas compositions are compared to the calculated values from
the so adapted two-phase model. Implementing parallel sections should however increase
the accuracy and prediction range of the model, since fast bubbles combined with low surface
to volume ratios, which are relevant for breakthrough of educt gases, are then addressed.
Effect of the radial position
The inﬂuence of the radial position on mean bubble properties with and without internals is
also analyzed using X-ray tomography. For this purpose, the ﬂuidized bed was separated into
four annuli, as shown in ﬁgure 5.31. For each annulus, the mean equivalent and hydraulic
diameters and the corresponding mean BRV are analyzed.
In ﬁgure 5.32, the mean equivalent bubble diameters are depicted as circles for different gas
velocities and positions in the bed. Directly above the distributor plate, the bubble sizes and
velocities (vectors at each circle) are nearly independent of radial position; this is observed for
the measurements with and without vertical internals. Without internals, larger bubbles are
detected in the central upper regions of the bed at higher positions. Surprisingly, the mean
BRV seems to be marginally larger at the outer walls, particularly for higher gas ﬂows. With
increasing gas velocity, bubble growth generally accelerates, and the differences between the
outer and inner annuli are increased.
With vertical internals, horizontal bubble coalescence is inhibited, which can be seen in the
decrease in equivalent bubble diameter compared with the bed without internals. The bubble
rise velocity is nearly independent from the radial position. The mean equivalent bubble
diameter is shown to increase in the center of the bed and with increased gas velocity. For
sample numbers smaller than 10, a green, dashed line is chosen for the circles; for example
u/um f = 4 and height = 48.1 cm did not produce sufﬁcient numbers of bubbles in annulus D.
For further comparison, the mean hydraulic diameters are plotted as functions of the gas ﬂow
and radial measurement position with and without internals (ﬁgure 5.33). With internals,

as functions of radial position. Green circles indicate less than 10 bubbles were detected in

both the mean hydraulic bubble diameter and BRV are nearly constant; this is important if a
catalytic reaction is conducted in a bed, as already discussed in detail above.
Relation between bubble size and velocity for individual bubbles
With the X-ray apparatus, the bubble rise velocity and diameter for each individual bubble is
measured, which allows a plot of individual bubble rise velocity as a function of the diameter
to be constructed. Several literature correlations, such as the correlation of Clift and Grace,
proposed a relationship between bubble size and rise velocity that is similar to eq. (5.22).
Fast bubbles are assumed to be generally larger, and large bubbles have a smaller surface-to-
volume ratio for mass transfer between the bubble and dense phase combined with a shorter
residence time. These fast and large bubbles could lead to a breakthrough of reactants and are
therefore most critical for catalytic reactions in bubbling ﬂuidized beds.
In ﬁgure 5.34, the individual bubble rise velocity is plotted as a function of the individual
equivalent bubble diameter with and without vertical internals for gas velocity ratios of
u/um f = 2, 3, 4 and different X-ray measurement positions in the bed. Surprisingly, the relation
proposed in eq. (5.22) does not seem to hold for individual bubbles at a single measurement
position in the bed.
We measured large and slow bubbles as well as small and fast bubbles at different positions in
the bed. It even seems like smaller bubbles tend to rise faster compared with larger bubbles,
which was not expected. With increasing bubble diameter, the distribution of velocities is less

Figure 5.34: Measured bubble rise velocity as a function of the equivalent diameter (X-ray);
blue dots: without internals; red dots: with internals
broad. A possible explanation for this might be that smaller bubbles are strongly inﬂuenced by
the wake of larger bubbles and are accelerated when they rise in a swarm of bubbles behind
a larger one. The acceleration of larger bubbles in the wake of others does not have such an
inﬂuence. Such behavior is known and is one of the reasons for bubble coalescence [41, 140].
We also analyzed the outcome of ﬁgure 5.34 at different annuli. The primary result is that
the number of bubbles decreases at outer annuli for higher gas velocities and measurement
positions. The distribution is only marginally affected, the mean values have been presented
in ﬁgures 5.32 and 5.33.
When the measurement data in the bed with vertical internals is compared with the data in
the bed without internals, one can see that the distribution of both the bubble rise velocity
and size is less broad with internals, indicating that the reactor design and layout of a bed with
vertical internals is likely simpler. This would become even more signiﬁcant if the BRV were
considered as a function of the hydraulic bubble diameter.
The distributions of measurement points generally broaden as the gas velocity ratio and as the
measurement height increases with and without internals. To describe the bubble behavior,
one could attempt, for instance, to use a histogram to describe the bubble sizes and rise
velocity distributions. By this the complex behavior of a real ﬂuidized bed could be mimicked
with a simple two-phase model, where usually the bubble size and velocity only depends
directly on the measurement height and the gas velocity, but does not imply any distributions.

a two-phase model must be analyzed in detail for each case; in general, it should not be the
mean value because, as already discussed, large and fast bubbles seem to control the reactor
behavior.
To conclude, there is no clear dependency between bubble size and rise velocity for individual
bubbles observed at a single measurement position. The averaged bubble size and rise
velocities increase however with the measurement height and the gas velocity as expected by
literature correlations. The most critical bubbles for the breakthrough of a reactant, fast and
large bubbles, almost do not exist in the analyzed bubbling ﬂuidized beds. A visualization of
these aspects is given in ﬁgure 5.35. In ﬁgure 5.35a, we plotted the bubble size and velocity
distributions as would be expected from different correlations, assuming that the bubbles
move towards the center of the column due to coalescence and that small bubbles rise
more slowly than larger bubbles. In ﬁgure 5.35b a sketch of the measured bubble size and
velocity distribution is shown; only the mean values increase with height, as proposed by the
correlations, but we did not see a simple correlation between equivalent bubble diameter and
rise velocity for individual bubbles in a bubble swarm at a single measurement position.

Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the inﬂuence of several controlling parame-
ters during image reconstruction on the studied hydrodynamic properties, such as the mean
bubble rise velocity and equivalent and hydraulic diameters, for the reactor with and without
vertical internals. The analyzed positions and parameters of the sensitivity analysis as well
as the applied standard values are summarized in table 5.4. A gas velocity ratio u/um f = 4 is
chosen for the analysis.
In ﬁgure 5.36, the mean bubble rise velocity is analyzed at a measurement height of 17.9 cm, all
parameters for image reconstruction were varied by ±15 %. For the reactor with and without
internals, the parameter “Max dx”, which is the maximum allowed horizontal change of a
bubble centroid between the two measurement planes, is shown to be most sensitive. For that
parameter, a variation of roughly ±2.3 % in bubble rise velocity was observed. As expected, an
increase of the minimum or maximum allowed bubble rise velocity leads to a slight increase in
velocity; the maximum allowed bubble rise velocity has a larger inﬂuence. The increase of the
minimum bubble volume also seems to reduce the rise velocity marginally, which corresponds
to the ﬁnding that larger bubbles tend to rise more slowly compared with smaller ones, as
discussed in section 5.3.4.
In ﬁgure 5.37, the inﬂuences of different parameters on bubble size are investigated. Both the
equivalent and hydraulic diameters are analyzed. The most sensitive parameter is determined
to be the threshold between the dense and bubble phase. The equivalent bubble size varies by
approximately ±8 % for a variation of ±15 % in the threshold and seems to be independent
of whether the vertical internals are present or not. The optimum threshold was chosen by
the procedure described in section 4.3.1: the air-ﬁlled thin walled acrylic glass tubes with
known diameters were applied to the ﬂuidized bed, and images were reconstructed with the
measured data. The minimum bubble volume also exhibits an inﬂuence on the measured
bubble size, as expected; with increasing minimum bubble volume, the measured bubble
size increases. Only the hydraulic diameter with employed vertical internals appears to be
unaffected by the minimum bubble volume.

Additionally, we investigated the inﬂuence of different parameters at a bed height of 43.0 cm
with and without vertical internals (ﬁgure 5.38). As before, the maximum horizontal bubble
movement between the measurement planes is found to be the most sensitive parameter.
The results for the bubble size at 43.0 cm are found to be fairly similar to that at 17.9 cm; again,
the threshold is found to be the most sensitive parameter. The increase of the minimum
bubble volume also results in a minor increase in the reconstructed bubble size.
5.3.5
Conclusions
Mean bubble volumes with and without vertical internals were ﬁrst analyzed. The vertical
internals in this setup lead roughly to a 60 % reduction in bubble volume; however, for some
measurements, slugging likely occurred. The reduction in bubble volume when vertical
internals were used implies a decrease in equivalent bubble diameter of about 16 %. The X-ray
results without vertical internals were also compared with a correlation from literature [113].
The correlation was found to underpredict the measured volume without internals for all gas
velocities and measurement positions by approximately 50 %.
The mean hydraulic bubble diameter with internals was found to be reduced to 1.5−2.5cm
compared with the 2 −8cm found without internals. While the mean hydraulic diameter
without internals was found to increase with gas velocity, as expected from the bubble size
correlations, the hydraulic diameter with internals was found to be nearly independent of gas
velocity, which indicates that the bubble growth occurs primarily in the axial direction, and
bubbles seem to be elongated with internals and higher gas velocities. Therefore, with vertical
internals, the surface-to-volume ratio is only marginally dependent on the measurement
height and more or less independent of gas velocity. Hence, the interfacial area per bubble
112

5.3. X-ray results with and without vertical tubes
volume between the bubble and dense phase is nearly constant, and thus, mass transfer is
signiﬁcantly easier to calculate.
Bubble size histograms showed that the distribution of the hydraulic diameter was signiﬁcantly
sharpened and shifted to smaller values when internals were used. The bubble size distri-
butions is important for catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds because they are often controlled
by the mass transfer between the bubble and dense phase. Thus, sharpening of the bubble
size distribution simpliﬁes the reactor design and should improve the predictions of simple
computer models, such as the two-phase model, which is discussed in more detail above.
Bubble rise velocity was also analyzed. With vertical internals, a decrease in mean bubble rise
velocity of approximately 20 % was measured compared with the reactor without internals. The
measured bubble rise velocity reached a maximum of approximately 0.75 m s−1 for u/um f = 4
with and without internals at heights of 28.0−38cm, which was probably due to the onset of
slugging. Mean bubble rise velocities were compared with the correlation proposed by [41],
and the correlation was found to underestimate the measurement without internals.
Bubble radial size and velocity distribution were also analyzed. With vertical internals, we
were able to show that the mean hydraulic diameter and the BRV were approximately constant
at different heights, ﬂuidization numbers and radial positions, as shown in section 5.3.4. Thus,
the bubble properties appear to be somewhat regularly with employed vertical internals.
The BRV of individual bubbles was further plotted as a function of equivalent bubble diameter.
It was found that both small and large bubbles rose with varying velocities and generally
independently of size throughout the bed. The well-known dependency between the mean
bubble diameter and the mean BRV thus cannot be transferred to individual bubbles rising in
a swarm of bubbles. However, the mean values of bubble diameters and BRV were both found
to increase with height, which was conﬁrmed by the measurements and is in agreement with
the known BRV correlations.
The reported X-ray results contribute to further understanding of the behavior of bubbles
within ﬂuidized beds and particularly support the layout and design of catalytic bubbling
ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical heat exchanger tubes. To date, little data regarding bubbling
ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals was available in the literature. The results of this study
can be applied in the future to develop advanced bubble size and velocity correlations for
reactors with and without vertical tubes and to improve or validate computer models of
bubbling ﬂuidized beds with and without vertical tubes.

Bubble hold-up with and without vertical internals
5.4.1
Abstract
X-ray tomography is applied to study the bubble hold-up and its distribution in bubbling
ﬂuidized reactors with and without vertical internals such as heat exchanger tubes. The main
objective is to understand the inﬂuence of vertical internals on the hold-up. It was shown
that with employed internals, the bubbles are more homogeneously distributed in the bed.
Especially for reactors with vertical heat exchanger tubes, which are relevant for catalytic
ﬂuidized beds with exothermic reactions, the provided results can be utilized for the validation
of computer models and the design of bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors.
5.4.2
Introduction
For the design of bubbling ﬂuidized beds, the bubble hold-up and the bed expansion are
essential, e.g. they are needed for the layout of the freeboard and the ﬁlter unit downstream of
the reactor. For catalytic ﬂuidized beds, the distribution and amount of gas bubbles inside
the bed is even more important, because it affects further hydrodynamic properties, such as
particle mixing, heat and mass transfer. In some catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds, the catalyst
particles are for example internally regenerated in the upper regions of the bed, as it is e.g.
assumed for the strongly exothermic methanation reaction [218].
For catalytic ﬂuidized bed reactors, the design and scale-up is a challenge, and parameters such
as particle mixing, heat and mass transfer have to be kept under control [168]. Those reactor
types often have vertical internals such as heat exchanger tubes. Therefore, the inﬂuence of
these vertical tubes or internals on the bubble hold-up and its distribution has to be known.
Different measurement series or correlations are available in open literature investigating
or describing the bed expansion and hold-up for bubbling ﬂuidized beds, however usually
without vertical internals [30, 243].
X-ray tomography can be applied to accommodate the need of more quantitative results with
high-resolution measurements. With X-ray tomography, the ﬂow within a ﬂuidized beds can
be visualized with high spatial resolution, as published by [99, 22, 69, 236]. Other measurement
techniques suitable to analyze the ﬂow within ﬂuidized beds and to measure the hold-up are
the MRI technique [180, 197, 109, 181, 240], or local optical or capacitive probes, as shown by
[32, 105, 169].
The X-ray measurement data enable the development of correlations for the bubble hold-up
and contribute to the design of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical internals.
It can also be applied for the validation of enhanced computer models such as computational

ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) models, discrete particle model (DPM) or computational particle ﬂuid
dynamics (CPFD) models. In this study, an ultra-fast X-ray scanner [179, 27] is employed to
collect reliable hydrodynamic information of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor once with, once
without vertical internals. The bubble hold-up and its distribution as well as the dense phase
voidage are investigated.
The experimental setup and employed measurement devices and particles were used for
several experiments and are therefore separately explained. Details about the X-ray apparatus
are provided in section 3.1, about the image reconstruction technique in section 3.2. The
employed 14 cm column and its dimensions are described in section 4.1.2, the characterization
of the employed γ-alumina powder is reported in section 4.2.

Results and Discussion
Bed hold-up via bed height measurement
To accurately deﬁne the hold-up of the complete bed (bubble hold-up plus change in dense
phase density), we ﬁrst measured the total bed expansion with and without vertical heat
exchanger tubes. The resulting graph is presented in ﬁgure 5.39a. The bed expansion at
minimum ﬂuidization velocity is about 1 % for the Geldart A/B particles used; at higher
ﬂuidization numbers, it reached up to 13 %. For the measurement without vertical internals,
the maximum tested ﬂuidization number is u/um f = 3.8, with vertical internals it is u/um f = 4.
The depicted error bars show the possible changes in hold-up, if the inaccuracy of the visual
bed height determination is taken into account, e.g. 43±0.5 cm. The total measured bed

expansion for the reactor with and without vertical heat exchanger tubes is similar. For the
reactor with internals, it is slightly larger at u/um f of 4 compared to the reactor without
vertical internals, which is explained by the decreased BRV, see section 5.3. These bed height
measurements can be taken as a reference for comparison to the results from the X-ray
apparatus, ﬁgure 5.39b. The X-ray results show a underprediction of the mean hold-up for
lower gas velocities. For higher gas velocities the hold-up without internals is overpredicted,
with vertical internals it is underpredicted as well.
Bubble hold-up and its distribution analyzed by X-ray tomography
The hold-up and its distribution within a ﬂuidized bed can be obtained using X-ray tomogra-
phy. For all gas velocities and positions in table 5.5, with and without vertical internals, we
calculated the centroid of each bubble as well as the radial hold-up distribution. The ﬁrst
step towards the bubble centroids and hold-up distribution is to transform the measured
X-ray intensity data into two-dimensional images representing the density distribution within
the column at a certain time. Thereafter, the 2D images are stacked and the centroid of each
void can be determined in the resulting three-dimensional matrix (with time on the vertical
axis). For measurement heights of 17.9 cm, 28.0 cm, 38.0 cm and 48.1 cm above the distributor
plate and a ﬂuidization number of four, examples of such quasi three-dimensional images
without as well as with internals are presented in ﬁgures 5.40 and 5.41, respectively. The scale
in z-direction is chosen such that a bubble rising with the number-weighted mean bubble rise
velocity is neither elongated nor contracted. The image reconstruction technique is described
in section 3.2.
As can be seen in ﬁgures 5.40 and 5.41, the bubble volume increases and the number of bubbles
decreases with measurement height due to bubble coalescence. Further, the vertical internals
lead to a higher number of smaller, but more elongated bubbles. With vertical internals, even
for a ﬂuidization number of four, the bubble size is decreased compared to the measurements
without internals at a ﬂuidization number of 3.8, which has been analyzed in all details in
section 5.3.
The centroids of the bubbles as well as the bubble hold-up within the cylindrical ﬂuidized bed
were also determined by means of the reconstructed images. This is done for all measurement
positions and bed heights shown in table 5.5. The results are summarized in ﬁgures 5.42
and 5.43. In ﬁgures 5.42 and 5.43, the centroids of each detected bubble, without as well
as with vertical internals, are depicted, the four columns represent different gas velocities

(without respectively with internals). The different rows represent a measurement height of
12.9 cm, 28.0 cm and 48.1 cm above the distributor plate, starting with the lowest measurement
position at the bottom. Each presented image depicts the bubble centroids (red “x”) at the
analyzed ﬂow conditions and measurement height. In the appendix A the images for every
measurement height are presented, see ﬁgure A.2.
Without vertical internals (ﬁgure 5.42), in the lower section of the bed a ring of several gas
bubbles is formed. The bubbles are unequally distributed for the lowest gas velocity ratio
of u/um f = 1.5. For increased gas ﬂow, the number of bubbles is also increased and a more
equal distribution is obtained. Still, most bubbles are measured in a ring surrounding the
center of the ﬂuidized bed at 12.9 cm above the distributor plate. It might be that the pressure
drop over the distributor plate is too low for the smallest gas velocity ratio analyzed, leading to
an unequal distribution of bubbles for u/um f = 1.5. For increased measurement height, the
bubbles coalesce and the number of bubbles is signiﬁcantly decreased. The bubble centroids
move towards the center of the bed, this process is faster with increased gas velocity, probably
due to a higher coalescence rate.
With employed vertical internals (ﬁgure 5.43), in the lower sections of the bed, most of the
bubbles centroids are located in the free space between the heat exchanger tubes. Small
preferential pathways seem to be formed in these areas. In the higher sections of the bed, the
bubbles are more homogeneous distributed, compared to a bed without vertical internals. The
centroids of the bubbles can be found at the positions of the vertical internals, which indicates
that larger bubbles surround the tubes completely. For a ﬂuidization number of 1.5, at the
higher positions in the bed no bubbles are detected. We double-checked whether or not the
bed was still ﬂuidized at minimum ﬂuidization velocity, which was the case. For increased gas
ﬂow, the number and size of bubbles is increased and the reconstruction became possible. The
radial movement of the bubble centroids can also be studied. With employed vertical internals,
the movement towards the center of the column due to bubble coalescence is slightly inhibited,
which can be seen, when ﬁgures 5.42 and 5.43 are compared. With employed internals, bubble
coalescence seems to occur more often in axial direction. An increase in gas velocity with
internals does not accelerate the coalescence of the bubbles as clearly as observed without
vertical internals. Details about image reconstruction with employed vertical internals are
provided in section 3.2.3.
In ﬁgures 5.44 and 5.45, the bubble hold-up distribution measured by X-ray tomography is
depicted with and without internals. With and without internals, the maximum local measured
bubble hold-up is 50 %. As can be seen in ﬁgures 5.44 and 5.45, a high local bubble hold-up
is already obtained for a ﬂuidization number of 1.5. Across the different bed heights, the
mean bubble hold-up is slightly increased with height. Especially close to the distributor plate,
a lower bubble hold-up was measured. This however, could also be an effect of the setup
and ﬂow conditions. For instance, small voids may be regarded as dense phase, because the
deﬁned threshold value to be counted as bubble phase is not overcome. Also bubbles, which
contain many particles, are probably not visualized, because a certain threshold is chosen.

5.4. Bubble hold-up with and without vertical internals
The slight increase in bubble hold-up may however also be explained by the ﬁndings described
in section 5.3, where individual bubbles are analyzed by X-ray tomography. There, a tendency
is found that larger bubbles with larger volumes move slower than the smaller bubbles at the
same height. It should be noted that the mean values given in many publications, e.g. for
the bubble rise velocity, are number-weighted means. That means, even if there are many
individual small and fast bubbles at the higher bed positions and the number-weighted mean
BRV is larger, the volume of the larger and mostly slower bubbles has a cubic inﬂuence on the
bubble hold-up. This will lead to a lower volume-weighted mean BRV, which can therefore
increase the bubble hold-up with height. Further, probably slugging occurred in the upper
regions of the bed (above 30 cm) for a gas velocity ratio of u/um f = 3 to 4. With employed
vertical tubes the bubble hold-up is well distributed between the tubes (ﬁgure 5.45). Even
though the tube to tube spacing is considerably small (about 30 particles), no signiﬁcant
preferential pathways are observed. In the appendix A the images for every measurement
height are presented, ﬁgure A.1.
5.4.4
Conclusions
Without vertical internals, in the lower regions of the bed a donut like bubble distribution is
obtained, as it was expected. With increasing bed height, bubble coalescence occurs and the
bubble move towards the center of the column. Bubble coalescence is faster with increased
ﬂuidization number. At the higher positions of the bed, the hold-up was slightly increased.
High local bubble hold-ups of up to 50 % were already measured for a ﬂuidization number of
1.5.
With employed vertical internals, the bubbles are more homogeneously distributed. The
radial movement of the bubbles is slightly inhibited and bubble coalescence seems to occur
more often in axial direction. With increasing gas ﬂow and height, more bubble centers are
located at the positions of the vertical internals, which means the bubbles are large enough to
surround the tubes.
With these high-resolution measurements of the bubble hold-up with and without vertical
internals, computer models (e.g. the two-phase model, CFD, DPM, CPFD), simulating
bubbling ﬂuidized beds, can be validated and the design of such reactors becomes more
reliable. From the data, correlations of the bubble hold-up can be developed.

Correlating bubble size and velocity distribution in bubbling
ﬂuidized bed
5.5.1
Abstract
The design and scale-up of bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors remain an ongoing challenge,
as the bubble size and velocity have to be known to enable reliable design of this reactor
type. Correlations between the average bubble size and rise velocity have been proposed
in the literature, however, their distributions are rarely found. Especially the relationship
between the distributions is typically unknown. Additionally, in catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized
bed reactors used for endothermic/exothermic reactions, bundles of heat exchanger tubes are
employed, which are not considered by most correlations. In this work, the results obtained
in a previous study and new data obtained using an ultra-fast X-ray apparatus were used to
develop both, a new type of bubble size and bubble rise velocity correlations, which include
the distribution of these values. All of this data can be expressed as a function of the gas
velocity and bed height. Two columns, one in laboratory scale and the other in pilot-scale,
both with vertical heat exchanger tubes, were investigated.
5.5.2
Introduction
Catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds are well suited for highly exothermic reactions, such as
methanation. For such reactors, mass transfer between the bubble and dense phase usually
limits the reaction rate [16]. Hence, large and fast bubbles, which have a low surface to volume
ratio and residence time within the reactor, are critical to the breakthrough of educt gases
[138]. Particularly, because of these large and fast bubbles, the bubble size and rise velocity
distribution have to be known to enable reliable design and scale-up [176, 208, 246].
The literature includes several reports about the distribution of the bubble size, chord-length,
and rise velocity in ﬂuidized beds [39, 31, 214]. Some researchers have derived a dependency
between the bubble size distribution and the chord-length distribution [234, 223, 247], others
have derived a dependency between the average bubble size and the average velocity [165,
189], while still others have developed correlations for the bubble size- or bubble rise velocity
distribution by relying on the Gamma, the Rayleigh distribution, or lognormal functions [156,
40, 209, 155, 85, 154, 244]. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of these
studies has developed a dependency between the bubble size distribution and the bubble rise
velocity distribution.
In this study, therefore, the authors set out to develop a method of simulating a bubble sample,
which includes the bubble size distribution and the bubble rise velocity distribution, based

on measured data. To this end, published X-ray measurement data from a lab-scale column
equipped with vertical heat exchanger tubes [170, 171] and unpublished data from a pilot-scale
column equipped with similar tubes (both described in the experimental section) were used.
Different superﬁcial gas velocities and measurement heights were studied using both columns.
The columns were ﬁlled with Geldart A/B particles. Details about the X-ray measurement
technique and its accuracy are provided in [179] as well as in the experimental section.
The use of the X-ray data provides the needed dependency between the rise velocities of
individual bubbles, rising in a swarm, and their size. Two different deﬁnitions of bubble
diameter have been applied: the volume equivalent spherical bubble diameter as well as the
hydraulic bubble diameter, the latter being calculated as four times the cross-sectional area of
a bubble at its center of mass, divided by the perimeter of the bubble, including the perimeter
of the enclosed internals.
The derived method for bubble simulation, applicable for lab- and pilot-scale ﬂuidized bed
columns with vertical internals such as heat exchanger tubes, could be used to validate
advanced bubbling ﬂuidized bed models, or as input data for obtaining better predictions.
5.5.3
Experimental
The experimental apparatus and employed measurement devices and particles were used for
several experiments and are therefore separately explained. Details about the X-ray apparatus
are provided in sections 3.1 and 4.3.1, about the image reconstruction technique in section 3.2.
The employed 14 cm and 22.4 cm column and its dimensions are described in section 4.1.2.
The columns were scaled by using the sectoral scale-up approach (section 2.7). In the present
comparison, different distributor plates were inserted, which change the initial properties of
the bubbles. It was decided to use a different distributor plate for the pilot-scale column, since
the type adopted in pilot-scale can also be used inside a ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor,
which planed to be investigated in the future. The characterization of the employed γ-alumina
powder is reported in section 4.2.
5.5.4
Data ﬁtting
Based on measured data, the distribution of the equivalent diameter (dbeq), the hydraulic
diameter (dbhyd ), and the bubble rise velocity (ub) were ﬁtted. To represent the measured
distribution, an adapted Gamma distribution expressed in eq. (5.23) was selected. This was
done for two reasons: ﬁrst, the measured data matches the Gamma distribution reasonably
well and the three parameters (shape α, scale β, and horizontal shift γ) provide a sufﬁciently
good ﬂexibility for the ﬁtting procedure. The mean value ¯x of the Gamma distribution is given
according to eq. (5.24).

Figure 5.46 illustrates the applied ﬁtting procedure for all three parameters. First, the distribu-
tion of the measured data for each point (height, ﬂuidization number, and column type) is
determined and a histogram is calculated. Second, the parameters of the Gamma distribution
are ﬁtted by applying a least-squares method using the fminsearch routine in Matlab. From
the resulting set of parameters (γi) (38 data points), a correlation ( ˆγ) for the horizontal shift is
derived as a function of the ﬂuidization number, measurement height and reactor size using
the R software [203] and eq. (5.25). Using the correlation ( ˆγ) for the shift and the measurement
data as input parameters, the ﬁtting of the Gamma distribution procedure is repeated in
Matlab to obtain the shape and scale value (αi,βi) (38 data points each). Thereafter, in
the same way as before, correlations for (αi,βi) are developed as a function of the height,
ﬂuidization number, and column size by using the R software [203]. This leads to ˆα, ˆβ and ˆγ as
a function of the measurement height in the ﬂuidized bed, the ﬂuidization number, and the
column type. Finally, ˆα, ˆβ and ˆγ can be inserted in eq. (5.23) to express the distributions of the
bubble rise velocity, of the equivalent and hydraulic bubble diameter.
For all ﬁts conducted in R, multiple linear regression using the ordinary least-squares method
is applied. The basic approach employed to obtain a ﬁt for property f (x) is shown in eq. (5.25).
Multi-linear regression allows us to determine the regression parameters ξ0,...,7 for any given
set of exponents π1,...,4. These exponents (π1,...,4) are determined by means of an optimization
algorithm, whereby the range of the exponents is iteratively reduced such that the F-statistic
of the resulting ﬁt is maximized. In the equation below, h is the measurement height, ς is the
size parameter (0 for lab-scale 1 for pilot-scale) and u/um f is the ﬂuidization number.

Once all the parameters have been identiﬁed, the ﬁt is optimized using the step function of R.
Thus an iterative process is conducted whereby, at each step, the variable contributing the
least to the ﬁt is dropped, until a point is reached at which the ﬁt begins to deteriorate. Finally,
the resulting ﬁt is evaluated based on its F-statistic and analysis plots in R. An example of
three analysis plots is depicted in ﬁgure 5.47. The residuals vs. ﬁtted value plot (ﬁgure 5.47a)
shows the dependence between the residuals and the ﬁtted value. The red line is obtained by
smoothing the residuals. If this red line varies from the horizontal, the ﬁt has neglected one
or more important inﬂuences. The normal Q-Q plot (ﬁgure 5.47b) is a visualization of how
well the assumption of Gaussian distributed errors holds. When all the points fall on to the
dashed line, the assumption is fulﬁlled. The scale-location plot (ﬁgure 5.47c) is similar to the
residual vs. ﬁtted value plot, except that now the square root of the standardized residuals is
plotted. This allows us to better detect any deﬂection from the horizontal. For the correlations
( ˆα, ˆβ and ˆγ) the residuals vs. leverage plot was additionally used to identify highly inﬂuential
points, or so-called "leverage points". Any point with a Cook’s distance greater than 0.5 could
adversely affect the quality of the ﬁt, because its inﬂuence is rather large. In ﬁgure 5.47 the
ﬁtted Gamma distributions of the equivalent bubble diameter in pilot-scale are compared to
histograms of the measurements.

Results and Discussion
Measured bubble shape in pilot-scale column
Based on the X-ray results, a quasi three-dimensional image reconstruction of the bubbles
inside the pilot-scale ﬂuidized bed can be conducted, which yields an impression of the bubble
shape, as well as the amount and size of the bubbles (with time on the vertical axis). The
lab-scale column was analyzed in earlier studies [170, 171]. Figure 5.48 depicts the bubbles
within the pilot-scale column at ﬂuidization numbers (u/um f ) of 1.5,2,3,4, and 6, as well as

for several heights above the distributor plate. All analyzed gas velocities and measurement
positions for both columns are summarized in table 5.6.
For the smallest gas velocity, almost no gas bubbles are detected in the column, especially
at the lower measurement positions. As the ﬂuidization number increases, the number of
bubbles and their sizes increase. With increasing height, the number of bubbles falls; however,
their size increases due to bubble coalescence. Large bubbles, or slugs, which ﬁll a major
part of the free cross-sectional area, are observed 56 cm above the distributor plate, for a
ﬂuidization number of 6.
Measured bubble size and velocity distributions
Using the X-ray tomographic results, it is possible to correlate the bubble size of every
individual bubble, rising in a bubble swarm, to their velocity. Figure 5.49 depicts the measured
bubble rise velocity as a function of the equivalent bubble diameter in the lab- and pilot-scale
column employed with vertical tubes. Due to limitations of the X-ray tomographic apparatus, a
minimum bubble size exists, which can be reliably identiﬁed. The minimum bubble diameter
of the reconstruction algorithm is set to 2 cm. Smaller bubbles present in some images are
potential artifacts and are not considered for the quantitative evaluation of the data. This
results in the sharp edge at 2 cm in the measurement data. With increasing height and gas
velocity, the number of bubbles falls, the bubble size distribution is widened and shifted to
the right. For larger bubble diameters, the bubble rise velocity distribution becomes narrower,
which is explained by the known acceleration of smaller bubbles in the wake of larger ones.
The change in the bed height seems to inﬂuence the velocity distributions only slightly.
Note that large and fast bubbles (expected from published literature correlations), which would
be observed in the upper right corner of each subplot, are rarely found in our experiments.
The mean values of both, the bubble rise velocity and the size, however, increase with the
height and gas velocity as expected from well-known bubble size correlations for ﬂuidized
beds without vertical tubes.
Correlating the bubble size and velocity distributions
Using the respective X-ray measurement results, correlations for both, the bubble size and
the velocity distribution were created. Important is that a possible dependency, between the

bubble size and bubble rise velocity can be reconstructed. The developed correlations enable
the expression of the bubble size and velocity distribution as a function of the measurement
position and ﬂuidization number for the lab- and pilot-scale columns. The procedure for
obtaining the ﬁts is described in section 5.5.4.
Examples of ﬁtted bubble size and velocity distributions are shown in ﬁgure 5.50, where each
ﬁt is based on a histogram with ﬁfteen columns. As described in section 5.5.4, the Gamma
distribution for the bubble diameters as well as that for the rise velocity was applied, which
yielded very promising results. By ﬁtting the bubble size distributions, the values for bubbles
smaller than 2 cm are extrapolated by the distribution function. The blue dots in ﬁgure 5.50 are
the measured values, overlaid by contour, which are created based on the ﬁtted distributions;
each line represents a certain probability of having a bubble of such a size and velocity at the
position.
For the bubble size and rise velocity distribution, the shape parameter α, the rate parameter
β, and the γ-values of the adapted Gamma distribution are ﬁtted for the different ﬂuidization
numbers, measurement positions, and column types. The size parameter ς is 0 for the
lab-scale column and 1 for the pilot-scale ﬂuidized bed. The volume equivalent spherical
bubble diameter distribution and the hydraulic bubble diameter distribution are given in
units of centimeters, whereas the velocity distribution is given in meters per second. The
correlations for the lab-scale column are valid for a ﬂuidization number between 2 and 4, and
a measurement height between 12 cm and 50 cm. The correlations for the pilot-scale column
are valid for a ﬂuidization number between 2 and 6, and for a measurement height between

These distributions can be used to reconstruct a sample of bubbles by applying a random
number generator. Basically, uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1 are
inserted into the inverse of the adapted cumulative Gamma functions for the bubble size
and bubble rise velocity. As a result, a sample is obtained, which includes bubble sizes and
bubble rise velocities similar to that which was measured. When the reconstructed bubble
rise velocities of the sample are plotted as a function of randomly selected equivalent bubble
diameters of the calculated sample, the plots shown in ﬁgure 5.51 are obtained. A similar
result is achieved, when the hydraulic rather than the equivalent bubble diameter is used.
Qualitatively, the measured values shown in ﬁgure 5.49 appear to be similar to the simulated
data shown in ﬁgure 5.51, regardless that the bubble rise velocity distribution seems to be
slightly dependent on the bubble diameter in reality, which is not included in the simulation
and the correlations. The possible dependence of the bubble rise velocity distribution on the
bubble diameter is not included, due to a lack of data points at some of the measurement
positions (corresponding to larger ﬂuidization numbers and heights). This seems to lead
to a slightly less pronounced triangular distribution in the simulation. However, note that
the overall size and velocity distributions are in good agreement, since the ﬁtted distribu-
tions of the bubble size and rise velocity have been used to simulate the data. Due to the
missing dependency in the simulated distributions, a quantitative comparison is required for
evaluation.

5.5. Correlating bubble size and velocity distribution in bubbling ﬂuidized bed
Figure 5.51: Fitting: BRV of single bubbles as a function of their equivalent diameter for small
lab- (red dots) and larger pilot-scale column (blue dots)
To that end, rectangles are randomly inserted into each subplot in ﬁgure 5.49 and the per-
centage of bubbles within the rectangle is counted. For these measurements, the lower left
corner of the rectangle is set to 2 cm and 0.2 m s−1, while the upper right corner is set to
16 cm and 3 m s−1 for the equivalent diameter, because the X-ray apparatus can only obtain
measurements within this area. For the hydraulic diameter, values between 1 and 5 cm are
accepted. Regarding the rectangles’ minimum size, it was required that at least 5 % of the
bubbles should be within its area. The same rectangles were inserted into the simulated data
in ﬁgure 5.51 and the percentage of bubbles within the rectangles was again calculated for
comparison. This was conducted for the different gas velocities, measurement heights, and
the two column sizes shown in ﬁgure 5.49. Figure 5.52 shows examples of the tested rectangles.
The percentage of bubbles within a certain area for the simulated data can be plotted as a
function of the percentage of bubbles within a certain area for the measured data, which
yields the parity plot shown in ﬁgure 5.53. The maximum standard deviation is 3.2 % for both
column sizes, which implies that if 100 bubbles are within the measured area, there is a 95 %
probability of the number of bubbles in the same area of the simulation being between 94
and 106. This underpins the assumption that the bubble size and bubble rise velocity are
randomly linked.
5.5.6
Conclusions
In ﬂuidization technology, knowledge of the hydrodynamic properties, such as the bubble
size and rise velocity is of crucial importance to the design of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor.
Often, only averaged values of these properties are provided, yielding an inaccurate description

5.5. Correlating bubble size and velocity distribution in bubbling ﬂuidized bed
of the ﬂow. Particular, in the case of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds, which are often limited
by the mass transfer between the bubble and dense phases, it is vital to be aware of the exact
bubble sizes and velocities, because large and fast bubbles can lead to breakthrough of educt
gas in such a column.
In this study, the hydrodynamic properties of a pilot-scale bubbling ﬂuidized bed column
equipped with vertical internal tubes were investigated by using an ultra-fast X-ray appa-
ratus. The bubble diameters, rise velocities and their distributions were qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluated. Reconstructed quasi three-dimensional images are given.
The X-ray measurement results from the lab-scale column (previously published data) and
pilot-scale ﬂuidized bed, both equipped with vertical tubes, were used to develop correlations
of the bubble size- and rise velocity distributions. The data ﬁtting was conducted with Matlab
and R.
The correlations thus obtained enable the reconstruction of both, the bubble size and the
bubble velocity distribution, all given as a function of the ﬂuidization number, the height in
the ﬂuidized bed, and the column size. Based on the correlations a sample of bubbles can
be simulated. For this purpose, the bubble sizes were randomly connected to the bubble
rise velocities from the distributions, which yielded in a promising description (similar as
measured) of the bubble behavior. Although the dependency of the bubble diameter- on
the bubble rise velocity distribution could not be considered, the accuracy was proven to be
signiﬁcant for the reconstructed sample, compared with the measured values.
With these new correlations, it becomes possible to evaluate complex computer models of
bubbling ﬂuidized beds capable of describing their ﬂow behavior in detail. The correlations
can be further applied to improve simple models, such as the two-phase model for ﬂuidized
beds. In the future, X-ray measurement data with higher spatial resolutions will help to yield
improved ﬁttings, while considering the ﬂuidization number, measurement positions, column
type, and additionally the bubble size in the distribution of the rise velocity, and therefore will
lead to an even better description of the ﬂow behavior.

Inﬂuence of optical probes on hydrodynamics
5.6.1
Abstract
X-ray tomography is applied to study the inﬂuence of an optical probe on the hydrodynamic
behavior of a gas solid bubbling ﬂuidized bed. For this purpose, single bubbles were centrally
injected at the bottom of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed of Geldart A/B particles, which was set
to minimum ﬂuidization velocity. X-ray measurements were conducted with and without
an optical probe at a measurement plane below and above the optical probe. No change in
bubble hydrodynamics were observed with employed optical probes, which make them useful
for permanent monitoring the ﬂuidization of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds.
5.6.2
Introduction
Absorption X-ray tomography is a powerful tool to gain insights in processes without optical
accessibility. With the high speed X-ray tomographic apparatus located at Delft University of
Technology, time-resolved images of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed can be obtained [179].
In this work, absorption X-ray tomography is applied to investigate the inﬂuence of a hor-
izontally mounted two-point optical probe on hydrodynamic properties of single bubbles,
such as the bubble size, rise velocity and shape, as well as on the frequency of bubble splitting.
Measurements are conducted with the X-ray apparatus above and below the optical probe
position with and without the optical probe. The column is set to minimum ﬂuidization
conditions for single bubble injection.
Similar studies have been conducted in the past, to investigate the inﬂuence of intrusive
optical probes on the measured solid volume fraction and particle velocity [43] as well as the
inﬂuence of the of the probe size on the results from a fast Fourier or Wavelet transform [62].
However, most published results in open literature, aim at a comparison of the results between
the different measurement techniques e.g. between optical probes and X-ray measurements
[185, 57]. The objective of this work is to certify the usage of optical probes in complex
environments such as industrial-scale catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors for permanent
monitoring the hydrodynamic behavior and ﬂuidization state.
The experimental setup and employed measurement devices and particles were used for
several experiments and are therefore separately explained. Details about the X-ray apparatus
are provided in section 3.1, about the image reconstruction technique in section 3.2. The
employed optical probe is described in section 4.3.2, the 14 cm column and its dimensions are
described in section 4.1.2, the characterization of the employed γ-alumina powder is reported
in section 4.2. No vertical internals such as heat exchanger tubes are employed in the column.

Bubble hold-up distribution for single bubble injection
To investigate, whether the single bubble injection was working properly, the bubble hold-up
(percentage of bubbles over time in the ﬂuidized bed) with and without employed optical
probe, for the lower and higher detector is plotted in a three-dimensional graph in ﬁgure 5.54.
For this measurement the lower X-ray plane is about 2 cm above the higher optical probe
tip. It should be noted that this hold-up depends on the frequency of bubble injection and
should only be used for comparison between the measurements with and without optical
probe conducted in this study.

As expected, the maximum in bubble hold-up is observed in the center, and rotationally
symmetric. Even for the measurement with employed optical probe we do not see a signiﬁcant
cleft, which would be an indicator for bubble splitting due to the stationary aligned optical
probe, or further indication for an increased bubble splitting frequency. Also the measured
maximum bubble hold-up is about 0.9 % in all cases, slightly higher at the lower detector, but
independent whether or not an optical probe is used.
Bubble size with and without optical probe
Some reconstructed three-dimensional bubble images with and without employed optical
probe are provided in the appendix ﬁgures A.3 and A.4. Out of these qualitative results, a
systematic analysis of the mean bubble size, the standard deviation as well as the standard
deviation of the mean was conducted. For the analysis, the raw data was additionally ﬁltered
to remove noise, e.g. voids smaller than 2 cm in diameter were not considered, because they
are not reliably reconstructed.
The bubble size is relevant in bubbling ﬂuidized beds, since it inﬂuences and is used to
predict hydrodynamic properties, heat and mass transfer as well as particle movement [178,
113]. Currently, it is still investigated by many researchers with different methods [167, 194].
Figure 5.55a shows the hydraulic bubble diameter, calculated in the centroid of each of the
approximately 50 bubbles per measurement. The hydraulic diameter of a bubble is calculated
as four times the horizontal cross-section, which goes through the bubbles centroid, divided
by the perimeter of the bubble.
Additionally, the standard deviation (larger error bar) and deviation of the mean (smaller error
bar) are displayed. Similar as expected from the height increase during single bubble injection,
136

5.6. Inﬂuence of optical probes on hydrodynamics
Figure 5.56: Mean bubble rise velocity for single bubbles, with standard deviation and standard
deviation of the mean
the mean hydraulic bubble diameter is about 6.2 cm. The mean varies between 5.7 and 6.3 cm
for the different positions with and without probe. There is no clear indication for a change
in bubble size with employed optical probe. One standard deviation is about 0.4 cm and the
standard deviation of the mean, which reduces with the number of measurements, is only
about 0.06 cm. Above the optical probe, the standard deviation of the bubble diameter is
increased and the bubble diameter is decreased, probably due to the more frequent bubble
splitting seen in the supplementary information.
The mean volume equivalent bubble diameter is approximately 6.6 cm. It is deﬁned as the
diameter of a sphere having the same volume as the bubble. Only for the measurement
without optical probe at 33.4 cm above the distributor plate the mean bubble size is reduced
to 6.3 cm. For this measurement the standard deviation and deviation of the mean is also
larger than for the others (more frequent bubble splitting). The standard deviation for this
measurement was 0.95 cm and the standard deviation of the mean was 0.13 cm.
Concluding the above mentioned points, the behavior of the bubbling ﬂuidized bed over a
height of 6 cm has a larger inﬂuence on the bubble size obtained as implementing an optical
probe with 5 mm outer diameter. Therefore a probe with such a size or smaller can be used
for permanent monitoring, as long as other important parameters, such as the bubble rise
velocity are not too much affected. Note, in the investigated case the bubble is an order of
magnitude larger than the probe diameter; if the difference is smaller, the experimental setup
is changed or higher gas velocities are analyzed, this might lead to a different conclusion.
Bubble rise velocity with and without optical probe
The bubble rise velocity is also important in ﬂuidized beds, since it inﬂuences directly the
residence time of the bubble phase. For catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized beds, where often the
mass transfer between bubble and dense phase limits the overall reaction rate [151], this
137

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
becomes even more important [168]. In ﬁgure 5.56 the mean bubble rise velocity is plotted
for all measurement positions. The mean bubble rise velocity is between 0.33 and 0.38 m s−1,
which is a quite narrow range. The standard deviation is between 0.04 and 0.12 m s−1. The
standard error of the mean is between 0.0062 and 0.0175 m s−1. The bubble rise velocity is
fairly unaffected by the probes. Hence, a probe with 5 mm in diameter or smaller can be used
for permanent monitoring bubbling ﬂuidized beds. The hydrodynamics are not inﬂuenced in
way that the permanent monitoring should be avoided.
5.6.4
Conclusions
The objective was to analyze the inﬂuence of optical probes in a bed of Geldart A/B particles,
to judge whether or not it can be applied for permanent monitoring. Especially in the case
of catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed, where the mass transfer between bubble and the dense
phase usually limits the overall reaction rate, no inﬂuence of the sensors on the bubble size is
desirable.
It was shown, that the bubble size and shape as well as the bubble rise velocity of single
bubbles injected at minimum ﬂuidization velocity is nearly unaffected by an optical probe
for the analyzed system. Further, no increase in bubble splitting was observed, the bubble
splitting was even slightly higher without optical probe.
According to the above mentioned points, an optical or capacitive probe of 5 mm outer
diameter can be easily used for permanent monitoring in similar ﬂuidized beds with bubble
sizes in the region of 6 cm. For further bed materials especially in other Geldart regimes,
or much smaller bubble sizes, more measurements should be conducted to ensure the
applicability.

Scale-up tests with optical probes
5.7.1
Abstract
The full set of scaling laws derived by Glicksman allows the hydrodynamic scale-up of ﬂuidized
bed reactors. In case of catalytic bed materials, changing the particle diameter during scale-
up may have consequences for mass transfer, catalyst activity, selectivity and deactivation
behavior. For catalytic ﬂuidized bed reactors of Geldart A/B particles with vertical internals
such as heat exchanger tubes, a scale-up approach is tested, that shall help to avoid this
dilemma of chemistry vs. hydrodynamics. It was found that at least two rows of tubes are
needed around the measurement position to neglect outer wall effects and to reach similar
hydrodynamic properties.
5.7.2
Introduction
Today scale-up failures such as the well-known that happened in Brownsville (TX, USA) in
1950 can normally be avoided. In Brownsville, a Fischer Tropsch ﬂuidized bed reactor with
Geldart B type iron catalyst particles was directly scaled from an inner diameter of 0.305m to
a 5m reactor. However, due to an improper scale-up procedure, the gas residence time and
conversion capabilities of the reactor were completely changed. One of the reasons was that
the bubble diameter in the pilot-scale reactor exceeded a critical value of roughly 2/3 times
the reactor diameter and slugging occurred [114], whereas in the industrial-scale reactor, the
bubbling regime was maintained and the larger bubbles rose much faster leading to a lower
gas residence time and yield due to gas bypassing [133].
As discussed earlier [206, 166, 167] usually, a selection of dimensionless numbers, e.g. the
full set of scaling relations derived by Glicksman [86], is applied for scale-up. More recent
studies however claim that Glicksman’s scaling laws can lead to mismatches in different
scales, especially for larger gas velocities [213, 184]. Also the lack of a particle pressure term,
which shall help to account for homogeneous ﬂuidization, was criticized [73]. Further, one
should differentiate clearly between hydrodynamic and chemical aspects in scale-up. In
case of catalytic reactors, changing the catalyst particle diameter during scale-up may have
consequences for the catalyst activity, selectivity and deactivation behavior. The mass transfer
limitations could be changed, leading to a signiﬁcantly different chemical behavior of the
scaled reactor. For more details about the Glicksman scale-up approach refer to section 2.7.
In previous experiments, pressure ﬂuctuation measurements have been applied [167] to
study the sectoral approach, which is applied in this study [207], and described in section 2.7.
However, no clear distinction was possible whether the scale-up was successful or not, when
Contents of this section have been published [168]

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
the power spectral density (PSD) of the signal was used to investigate scale-up [55, 70, 182,
226]. The sectoral scale-up approach for ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals replaces the
reactor diameter in Glicksman’s criteria with the hydraulic diameter, which is kept constant
across the different scales. Therewith, a pilot-scale reactor is up-scaled to commercial-scale by
parallelisations. Ikeda and coworkers considered the hydraulic diameter during scale-up of an
acrylonitrile reactor with internals, however they changed the hydraulic diameter across the
different scales [144]. In a review by Grace and Harrison, two different methods to scale-up a
ﬂuidized bed towards commercial-scale were mentioned: the ﬁrst is to treat the pilot plant
as a section of the full-scale plant and multiply it accordingly; the second one is to scale-up
the pilot plant dimensions generally [90]. The sectoral scale-up approach can be considered
similar to the ﬁrst of these two methods and can be applied for all reactors with vertical
internals such as heat exchanger tubes. The approach leads to a constant catalyst particle size,
temperature and pressure at all scales, which shall enable scaling both hydrodynamics and
chemistry in a proper way.
The objective of this work is to experimentally analyze the applicability of the sectoral scale-
up approach to scale catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical internals. The
hydrodynamics of the scaled reactors and the limitation of the approach shall be investigated
by means of optical probe measurements. Especially, the minimum size of a sector and
the maximum ratio between bubble and reactor diameter for successful scale-up shall be
determined.
5.7.3
Results and Discussion
The hydrodynamics within four different conﬁgurations of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed column,
scaled with the sectoral approach, are studied by means of optical probe measurements.
Details about the sectoral scale-up approach can be found in section 2.7. The column
design and layout as well as further information about the experimental setup are provided in
section 4.1.1. The particle characterization is given in section 4.2.
For all experiments, the measured chord-length, the bubble rise velocity and the bubble
hold-up are analyzed for the different reactor scales (including 9, 19, 28 or 37 tubes), to
evaluate whether successful scale-up is possible with the sectoral approach. In ﬁgure 5.57a,
the probability density estimates based on a normal Kernel function, see [25] for details, and
number based mean values (i.e. the arithmetic mean) of the measured chord-length (short
vertical lines in each graph) are depicted for four different reactor conﬁgurations and six
different gas velocities measured in 3cm distance to the outer reactor diameter. Further, the
Hovmand & Davidson criterion for the onset of slugging is depicted in ﬁgure 5.57a as long
vertical lines covering all gas velocity ratios for comparison [114]. The measurement position
243mm above the distributor is indicated by a black circle with an “x”.
The smallest conﬁguration (nine tubes) is depicted as a green, dotted line, and shows a clear
deviation from the other geometries for gas velocity ratios above 1.6. Both, the numbed

distributions and number-based mean values (short vertical lines) measured in 3cm distance
from the outer reactor wall for different gas velocities and u-shaped inserts
based mean value and the distribution are shifted to the right. The number based mean
value is actually nearly doubled compared to the larger cross-sections and the chord-length
distribution is ﬂattened. Additional smaller deviations are obtained for the lower gas velocity
ratios of 1.2 and 1.6. Here the nine and 28 tube conﬁguration show a deviation in measured
chord-length compared to the 19 and 37 tube conﬁguration. Both the mean value and the
distribution are shifted to the right.
While the deviation for the smaller gas velocity ratios of 1.2 and 1.6 cannot be explained
by analyzing the measured chord-length only, the deviations for larger gas velocities are
explainable in a reasonable manner by the onset of slugging or a similar effect. Optical
inspection in our glass column shows the development of large bubbles surrounding or
enclosing several vertical tubes. For the onset of slugging in freely bubbling beds, different
criteria can be found in the literature. In the most cases the maximum ratio between bubble
and reactor diameter is given. The onset of slugging was assumed to start, if e.g. the equivalent
bubble diameter exceeds 50% of the reactor diameter [13]. Other authors predict that the
onset of slugging starts roughly, if the equivalent bubble diameter exceeds 60% [114], or 2/3
of the reactor diameter [144]. Although one could expect that beds with internals deviate
from freely bubbling beds, our ﬁndings for the measured chord-length data seem to be in
141

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
reasonable agreement with the slugging predictions from literature. Only for the 19 tube
conﬁguration at higher gas velocity ratios of 4 and 6, the correlation predicts already the onset
of slugging, which however cannot be seen in the measurements. This can be explained by the
vertical internals which could hinder the onset of slugging slightly. Further, we measured the
chord-length of the bubbles and not their equivalent diameter with the optical probes. The
ratio between chord-length and bubble diameter is probably also inﬂuenced by the vertical
heat exchanger tubes [144]. Due to the excellent optical access to the glass column reactor, not
only the measured chord-length was used as indicator for slugging, but it was also possible to
visually study the onset of slugging in the nine tube conﬁguration. The correlations for the
onset of slugging however have to be taken with caution, because they all were derived from
beds without vertical internals.
For slugging it is known, that the bubble rise velocity can no longer be expressed by the
standard formula for a freely bubbling bed [41]. Hence the correlation between size and bubble
rise velocity should be changed as soon as slugging occurs, which is checked in the following
when the bubble rise velocity is analyzed in ﬁgure 5.57b. For slugging also a relatively large
bubble hold-up should be measured close to the outer reactor wall, which is later conﬁrmed
in ﬁgure 5.59 and ﬁgure 5.60. When chemistry is involved, the measured chord-length and
bubble size becomes important. The surface-to-volume ratio of a bubble combined with the
mass transfer between bubble and dense phase deﬁnes how fast the gas composition within a
bubble is in chemical equilibrium with its surrounding. Hence, also the chord-length is one of
the most important parameter during scale-up. When different reactor scales are compared,
the onset of slugging may lead not only to changes in surface-to-volume ratio, but also to
changes in further important parameters such as the residence time distribution of the gases,
bubble hold-up, mass and heat transfer and catalyst lifetime. Finally, the yield, conversion
and operation cost of the ﬂuidized bed reactor may also be effected. Therefore, the smallest
nine tube conﬁguration is too small for scale independent experiments, due to the early onset
of slugging.
Comparing the BRV distribution to the chord-length distribution, only the 28 tube conﬁgura-
tion shows an increased BRV for a gas velocity ratio of 1.6, while for the measured chord-length,
an increase was observed for the 9 and 28 tube conﬁguration. Hence it might be, that the gas
ﬂow used for the 28 tube conﬁguration was a little bit higher than planned, because both the
chord-length and bubble rise velocity is increased. The nine tube conﬁguration, however, is in
good agreement with the BRV distribution measurement of the 19 and 37 tube conﬁguration
for gas velocity ratios of 1.2 and 1.6. The approximately equal bubble rise velocity for all
u-shaped inserts, even for the smallest nine tube conﬁguration, can be explained by a change
in ﬂow regime for the nine tube conﬁguration from bubbling towards slugging. Equation (5.29)
is capable to describe the bubble rise velocity in a freely bubbling bed without internals, Clift
& Grace [41]. A change in ﬂow regime from bubbling towards slugging leads, according to
Matsen et al. [164], to a decreased prefactor v in eq. (5.29). For further comparison, the
classical formula of Clift and Grace (eq. (5.29)) was applied to calculate the bubble rise velocity
for our set-up using the measured chord-lengths as input for the bubble diameter. The factor

Y was derived by Werther [245] to be roughly 0.67 for a porous distributor plate, and the factor
v was derived by Hilligardt & Werther [106] as a function of the bed diameter to be 2.0D1/2.
For the calculation the total bed diameter without internals was applied and the results are

Matsen et al. analyzed the slug rise velocity for particles sizes between 40 and 7300µm. He
suggested to use eq. (5.30) for beds without internals [45]. For the slug rise velocity, he assumed
that only the column diameter is of importance.

If the measured mean chord-length is taken as an approximation for the unknown bubble
diameter in eq. (5.29), the bubble rise velocity can be approximated, see Table 1. In Table
1, additionally the slug rise velocity is calculated by means of eq. (5.30), and the results
are compared to the measured mean bubble rise velocity (for 19, 28 & 37 tubes). For the
measurements with vertical internals, both, eq. (5.29) and eq. (5.30) do underestimate the
measured bubble rise velocity for higher gas velocities, when the chord-length is used as an
approximation for the bubble size. For the column diameter in eq. (5.30), the diameter of
the full cross-section was applied for the nine tube conﬁguration, i.e. 5.6cm. If the hydraulic
diameter would have been used for the calculation of the rise velocity in eq. (5.29) and eq. (5.30),
even smaller values would have been calculated.
Hence, other prefactors for the slug and bubble rise velocity seem to be necessary to account
for the vertical heat exchanger tubes. A similar effect of vertical internals has been earlier
observed by Grace and Harrison; they showed that air bubbles were elongated by the internals
and therefore rose faster [89].

Additionally, for ﬂuidized beds with vertical internals the factor v is probably no longer a
function of the total bed diameter, but a function of the hydraulic diameter. This would lead to
a bubble rise velocity which is independent from the u-shaped inserts as long as the bubbling
regime is maintained and to a constant v for the applied u-shaped inserts.
A good ﬁt of the measured bubble rise velocity (mean of all inserts) is obtained, if the
mean chord-length for the 19, 28 and 37 tube conﬁguration is taken as input parameter
for eq. (5.29). The parameters Y and v are ﬁtted by minimizing the squared differences
between the measurements and the correlation, see ﬁgure 5.58a. With Y = 1.69 and v = 1.10,
eq. (5.29) describes the measured bubble rise velocity well.
A similar graph is obtained if the measured mean chord-length of the nine tube conﬁguration
is used as input for eq. (5.29) to ﬁt the measured bubble rise velocity, see ﬁgure 5.58b. Similar
to what was proposed by Matsen, the prefactor v is reduced by 30% roughly from 1.1 in the
bubbling regime towards 0.78 in the slugging regime. The prefactor Y is kept unchanged as
expected by Werther [245]. This means, for the same measured chord-length, the slug rise
velocity is smaller than the bubble rise velocity. In comparison, Matsen measured a reduction
of roughly 50% for the parameter v for slugging and beds without internals. However, he used
Y = 1 instead of Y = 0.67. From a chemical point of view, a similar bubble rise velocity and
distribution for all scales leads to a similar residence time distribution of the bubble phase,
which is one of the objectives of the sectoral scale-up approach.
The same experiments have been conducted for three further probe positions, namely at 3.5,
2 and 1cm distance from the outer reactor wall, depicted in ﬁgure 5.59. Again, a deviation
of the number based mean chord-length for the smallest nine tube conﬁguration can be
clearly observed for all measurement positions and gas velocity ratios above 1.6 (ﬁgure 5.59,
column b). At a distance of 1cm to the outer reactor wall and gas velocity ratios above two,
the measured mean chord-length for nine tubes is about twice as large compared to the
144

5.7. Scale-up tests with optical probes
other conﬁgurations. Again, the onset of slugging explains the changes in measured mean
bubble size for the smallest nine tube conﬁguration. This conﬁrms that the smallest nine tube
conﬁguration is unsuited for scale independent experiments.
The number based mean bubble rise velocity was also analyzed at 3.5, 2 and 1cm distance
to the outer reactor wall (ﬁgure 5.59, column a). At 3.5, 3 and 2cm distance from the outer
reactor wall, for the different scales and all gas velocities above two, the BRV is approximately
equal and only a function of the gas velocity ratio itself.
Distortions are observed for a distance of 1cm to the outer reactor most probable due to wall
effects. Further, the mean BRV shows at 3.5cm distance to the outer reactor wall and a gas
velocity ratio of 1.6 for the 28 tube conﬁguration a similar increase in BRV as mentioned for
the 3cm distance measurement. At 2cm distance from the outer reactor wall a deviation is
obtained for a gas velocity ratio of two for the nine and 28 tube conﬁguration. They show a
difference in mean BRV by nearly a factor of two compared to the 19 and 37 tube conﬁguration.
For all other gas velocities, at 2cm distance from the outer reactor wall, the mean BRV is nearly
equal for the different reactor scales. In general, the inﬂuence of the gas velocity on the bubble
rise velocity is large for gas velocity ratios below two, above two a nearly linear dependency is
obtained as expected [41].
If only the bubble rise velocity would be analyzed, all reactor scales seem to be suited for scale
independent experiments, due to a similar residence time distribution of the bubble phase.
However, as already shown above, the onset of slugging for the nine tube conﬁguration is a
crucial point and has to be avoided.
An interesting phenomenon is observed, if the bubble hold-up is analyzed in more detail
(ﬁgure 5.59, column c). The bubble hold-up increases monotonically for the smallest conﬁgu-
ration (nine tubes) with increasing gas velocity, at all measurement positions. Even close to
the outer reactor walls, a relatively large bubble hold-up is measured, in contrast to the larger
scale reactors, where the hold-up is decreased.
For the 37 tube conﬁguration a maximum in the bubble hold-up is found at u/um f = 2 and
3cm distance from the outer reactor wall. For the 19 and 28 tube conﬁguration, a maximum
is obtained close to the reactor wall at 2cm distance and u/um f between two and three. For
larger gas velocities, the measured hold-up decreases again. At 1cm distance from the reactor
wall, exactly the same hold-up is measured for the 19, 28 and 37 tube conﬁguration with a
maximum at u/um f = 2.
These observations can be explained in a reasonable manner. The origin of the large hold-up
measured with the nine tube conﬁguration might be that most measurements are auto-
matically performed close to the centerline of the reactor. For the small reactor size, the
bubbles can only move upwards and, due to lateral coalescence, in the direction of the
centerline of the reactor. Therefore most bubbles are pierced, if the probe is located near the
center. Furthermore, if two bubbles are present above the distributor plate, the probability of

coalescence is larger in a smaller reactor and bubble growth is enhanced. To compare absolute

In ﬁgure 5.60, the outer reactor walls are located at a normalized measurement position of
zero and one, the centerline of the reactor is at a position of 0.5 on the horizontal axis. To
compare the hold-up close to the reactor walls, for each gas velocity two Gaussian distributions
multiplied by a constant are ﬁtted to the data points, assuming symmetry with respect to the
centerline of the reactors. The dashed lines are the ﬁts for the measurements with nine tubes;
the full lines are the ﬁts for the measurements with 19, 28 and 37 tubes. The sum of squared
residues for all measurement points is minimized for the ﬁtting.
For gas velocity ratios above 1.6, the measured hold-up near the reactor walls in the nine
tube conﬁguration is larger, compared to the 19, 28 and 37 tube conﬁguration, where it is
approaching zero. For the nine tube conﬁguration the maximum in hold-up is found in the
centerline of the reactor. The maximum is increased with the increasing gas velocity from 15%
at a gas velocity ratio of 1.2, towards 60% for a gas velocity ratio of 6. The difference of the
nine tube conﬁguration, especially closer to the reactor walls, can be explained by the onset of
slugging for gas velocity ratios above 1.6. However, also the deviation between the data of the
reactors with 19, 28 and 37 tubes is relatively large. A possible explanation is the alignment
147

Chapter 5. Results and discussion
of the tubes itself. For the same normalized measurement position the relative position of
the vertical tubes is generally not the same, which has also an impact on the bubble hold-up
[204]. Therewith the deviations in the measured hold-up for the 37 tube conﬁguration might
be explained.
While the deviation in bubble hold-up may have only slight direct effects on yield, conversion
and selectivity, due to similar sizes and velocities of the bubbles, these deviations may lead to
changes in catalyst movement, which can shorten the lifetime of catalyst particles in processes
where the catalyst is internally regenerated in the higher regions of the bed [134, 183]. For
further improvements, therefore the particle movement should be analyzed as well.
5.7.4
Conclusions
The objective of this work is to experimentally analyze the limitations of the sectoral scale-up
approach, which reduces the complexity of scaling catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors
with vertical internals signiﬁcantly. Usually scale-dependent parameters such as mass transfer,
selectivity and activity, as well as temperature and pressure are kept constant when the column
diameter in Glicksman’s scale-up criteria is exchanged with the hydraulic diameter of the
vertical internals.
To proof the scale-up concept, a series of comparison measurements was conducted with
four different cross-sectional areas. The measured mean bubble rise velocity and distribution
was approximately equal for all scales, while the measured chord-length and hold-up differed
signiﬁcantly for the smallest nine tube conﬁguration. From the measurement results it can
be derived that at least two rows of tubes are needed around the measurement position to
neglect outer wall effects and to reach similar hydrodynamic properties. The smallest nine
tube conﬁguration is unsuited for scale independent experiments due to the early onset of
slugging.
For the sectoral scale-up approach, two limitations can be reported. First, the normalized
position of the vertical tubes changes during scale-up, which may have effects on catalyst
movement and lifetime. Second, the constant bed height requirement for all scales leads to
high aspect ratios in the lab scale. A maximum bubble size of roughly 2/3 times the reactor
diameter should not be exceeded in the lab scale, as otherwise a signiﬁcant deviation in
hydrodynamics, caused by a slugging might occur.
Nevertheless, the sectoral scale-up approach seems to be a practical way to scale-up catalytic
bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors with vertical internals. The method will enable industry to
design and optimize these reactors with reduced costs and development time.

6 Conclusions
This work is an extension of the knowledge on the subject "catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed
(BFB) reactors" using the example of the methanation reaction. Existing information shall be
supplemented until the industrial implementation of the methanation technique developed
at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) with reasonable technical risks is possible. Therefore, in
the scope of this thesis a more general understanding of the reactor behavior needed to be
developed. This is accomplished by studying the effect of immersed vertical internals used as
heat exchanger tubes in catalytic BFB reactors, because the vertical tubes inﬂuence nearly all
the important properties of the BFB reactor. In literature a large amount of measurement data
and correlations is available to describe the hydrodynamics of bubbling ﬂuidized beds without
vertical internals, however, data relating to BFBs with vertical internals is comparatively scarce.
Furthermore, the two main technical risks have been investigated in detail. These are the
change of hydrodynamic properties during the upscaling of the reactor (with associated
possible mass transport and conversion limitations, as well as catalyst deactivation) and
catalyst particle abrasion, which can also lead to reactor shutdown. The main objective of
the present work is therefore to contribute to reliable scale-up catalytic ﬂuidized beds from
laboratory scale to industrial-scale, without incurring unmanageable risks.
For this purpose, different measurement techniques and in-depth methodological com-
petence has been established. These can be used to characterize ﬂuidized beds. Due to
insufﬁcient demand combined with high requirements special measurement equipment for
the application in catalytic ﬂuidized beds is commercially not available. Therefore, a special,
high temperature optical sensor was developed in parallel to the conducted studies and exper-
iments. By means of this sensor, it will be possible to locally examine various hydrodynamic
properties during the methanation reaction, at high pressures and temperatures. For example
the inﬂuence of the volume contraction on the hydrodynamics and mass transfer between
the bubble and dense phase can be investigated in the future. Furthermore, it is discussed in
this work, under which circumstances such local sensors can be used to determine the overall
reactor performance. By means of X-ray tomography it was shown that optical probes can be
used for permanent monitoring of the hydrodynamics properties in industrial ﬂuidized beds;
149

Chapter 6. Conclusions
no signiﬁcant changes in bubble hydrodynamics were observed. Additionally, a Monte Carlo
simulation was performed. It has been shown in the simulation that the calculated speed of
the bubble phase can be massively falsiﬁed by local measurements. In this regard, further
methods should be developed to transform the results from local measurements to make
reliable statements about the overall reactor performance. In this regard some proposals are
made in the outlook.
By means of X-ray tomographic measurements we further investigated and visualized the
hydrodynamics of ﬂuidized beds with and without vertical internals, such as heat exchanger
tubes. Since in literature not much about ﬂuidized bed with vertical internals was published,
we investigated the inﬂuence of vertical tubes in detail. All bubble characteristics such as vol-
ume, hydraulic diameter, rise velocity, hold-up and the respective distributions were examined
with but also without vertical internals. Through the detailed evaluation of the measurement
results it could be shown that the often universally regarded relationship between bubble size
and rise velocity is only true for the mean values for different measurement heights and gas
velocities, but not for individual bubbles in a bubble swarm at a single measurement height.
Individual bubbles seem to rise irrespectively of their size at different speeds in the ﬂuidized
bed regardless whether vertical internals are employed. In summary, one can say the vertical
internals hinder the horizontal bubble coalescence, thus the bubble volume is slightly reduced.
Internals change the shape of the bubbles, they appear to be stretched and offer a greater
and approximately constant volume speciﬁc surface area, which is also visible by a signiﬁcant
reduction of the hydraulic bubble diameter. Some larger bubbles surround the vertical tubes
completely. This all combined leads to a kind of structuring of the bubbles in the ﬂuidized bed
and therefore simpliﬁes scale-up with employed vertical internals.
Based on the X-ray measurement results from the lab- and pilot-scale ﬂuidized beds equipped
with vertical tubes correlations of the bubble size and rise velocity distributions were devel-
oped. The data ﬁtting was conducted with Matlab and R. The new correlations enable to
reconstruct both, the bubble size and velocity distribution and their relation between each
other as a function of the ﬂuidization number, height in the ﬂuidized bed and employed
column type. Based on the correlations a sample of bubbles can be simulated. Although the
dependency of the bubble diameter on the bubble rise velocity distributions could not be
considered, the accuracy was proven to be signiﬁcant for the simulated sample, compared to
the measurements.
The implementation of the measurement data and correlations into a two-phase model
for the methanation reaction is also discussed: the simplest way is to replace the existing
correlations for the averaged bubble rise velocity and size with the new correlations, which
account for vertical heat exchanger tubes. More advanced solutions would imply the usage of
the distributions of the bubble properties, since a breakthrough of reactant is not expected
from averaged bubbles, but from the ones with low surface to volume ratios rising with high
velocities. The bubble phase in the two-phase methanation model could be split into several
parallel sections, each section including a different bubble size and rise velocity according to
150

the measured distributions and hold-up. Combined with a certain mass transfer between the
different sections, to account for bubble coalescence and splitting, this is regarded as the most
promising solution for direct improvements of the two-phase model.
The sectoral scale-up approach developed at PSI, to scale-up catalytic ﬂuidized bed reactors
with vertical internals was also tested. Different limits have been deﬁned, which are to be
observed. These are: a maximum ratio of bubble to reactor diameter of 2/3 should not be
exceed. Furthermore, it can be noted that at least two rows of vertical heat exchange tubes
shall be enclosed between a measuring point and the outer reactor wall to exclude external
wall effects. In summary, it was found that as long as the limits described in section 5.7 are
met, the sectoral scale-up approach is well suited to scale catalytic ﬂuidized beds with vertical
internals. Based on these results, the minimum size of a bubbling ﬂuidized bed column was
deﬁned.
Elutriation of catalytic particles can lead to shutdown of the reactor for exothermic catalytic
ﬂuidized beds and must be considered. The reason is a possible overheating of mostly
non-cooled ﬁlter units downstream the ﬂuidized bed, which can lead to destruction of
the ﬁlter. Therefore, the abrasion of catalyst support materials was studied in long-term
(500 h) experiments, considering also interparticle forces. It was found, that in a grounded
ﬂuidized bed column, electrostatic forces can be neglected with great probability, at least
for the investigated γ-alumina and dolomite particles. Van der Waals forces seem the main
cause of particle clustering and sticking of ﬁnes at coarse particles and the column walls.
Based on the long-term experiments, a simple correlation was developed, which can describe
the particle attrition as a function of gas velocity and time. Since it was found that the
maximum electrostatic charge can lead to relevant interparticle forces and hence possible
particle adhesion and clustering it is recommended to analyze particle charges in all future
measurement campaigns of particle attrition and elutriation.
In the subsequent outlook some limitations of the present work are explained and there are
a number of proposals submitted in order to ensure a meaningful continuation of scientiﬁc
activities. The limitations of the optical measurement technique and how to certify their use
are discussed. In addition, suggestions for the ongoing research are made, in particular it
is addressed that an exhaustive investigation of the hydrodynamics in BFBs is only possible
taking into account the volume contraction during the methanation reaction.

7 Outlook
This chapter contains a summary of recommendations for follow-up work in the context of
the synthetic natural gas (SNG) production process. Based on the available X-ray tomography
data, it is ﬁrst recommended to further validate the use of the optical sensor technology. For
this purpose, the existing stacked two-dimensional X-ray tomography images of the bubble
properties seem to be ideally suited (the x and y-axes contain the space, whereas the z-axis
represents the time). The idea is to place an imaginary optical probe at a certain radial
position in the image and "record" the signal at that position as a function of time. By using
the existing optical codes, the bubble properties could be evaluated and directly compared
to the tomography data. This comparison could be carried out at several radial positions,
as well as for measurements with and without vertical internals. Finally, the optical code
should be validated for usage with and without vertical internals, which means it should be
shown that the global bubble properties can be correctly determined with the aid of a perfectly
working local probe. In particular, the comparison with employed vertical internals seems
interesting, as the bubble shape is affected by the internals and the local measurements with
optical probes only allow determination of the pierce length and rise velocity. The second
step would be to compare the actual data collected by the optical probes to the imaginary
acquired data from the X-ray tomography, which should yield a qualiﬁed statement about the
sensitivity of the probes.
The review of the sectoral scale-up approach with the use of optical sensors and the X-ray
results have already shown that the sectoral approach is generally suited to scale catalytic,
bubbling ﬂuidized beds. The additional measurement of the gas residence time distribution
in ﬂuidized beds with different sizes would provide further conﬁrmation that the scalability
is feasible; for example, similar bubble properties and, hence, mass transport limitations,
combined with a similar residence time of the gases would underpin the sectoral scale-up
approach. Otherwise observed deviations would allow the deﬁnition of further limits for the
application of the sectoral scale-up approach.
The scheduled methanation reactor is currently implemented at the pilot-scale (GanyMeth),
with future plans to include it in the energy system integration (ESI) production platform.
153

Chapter 7. Outlook
This provides the opportunity to perform selected fundamental experiments. Beginning
with non-reactive experiments it would be exciting to use the GanyMeth reactor to explore a
phenomenon that only occurs for Geldart A particles at high pressures. The aim would be to
observe a so-called particulate non-bubbling mode, which theoretically allows very high heat
and mass transfer rates. Recall that the heat and mass transfer abilities of the methanation
reactor could limit its performance depending on conditions. Hence, the exploitation of
this mode could result in an ideal operating mode capable of enhancing the performance of
the ﬂuidized bed methanation reactor. Furthermore, the heat transfer for different particles,
pressures, and heights of the bed could be investigated during non-reactive experiments. In
terms of reactive experiments it would be particularly exciting to investigate the inﬂuence of
volume contraction (up to 50 %) on the bubble properties during the methanation reaction.
For this purpose, it is recommended to use not only pressure ﬂuctuation measurements (PFM)
and optical probes, but also an area detector and a similar X-ray source to evaluate the bubble
properties with reaction. These X-ray sources and detectors have since become commercially
available.
The advancements in the ﬁeld of X-ray tomography should be monitored continuously,
because it is assumed that within 5−10 years, X-ray systems should be available with which
individual particles can be visualized. Until then, various technologies such as positron
emission particle tracking (PEPT), thick gaseous electron multiplier (THGEM) or similar
techniques using radiolabeled tracers could be applied to visualize the particle motion in
ﬂuidized beds. Particle tracking would be one of the last key building blocks required to ensure
reliable scaling of the catalytic bubbling ﬂuidized bed, because catalyst deactivation seems to
be strongly related to its movement. Furthermore, a beam line with higher spatial resolution
could be used to examine the catalyst particles within a gas bubble, as well as the behavior of
gas bubbles in the vicinity of a single vertical tube or a very small bundle of tubes in greater
detail.
As the measured data could also be used for the validation of more complex models of bubbling
ﬂuidized bed (BFB) methanation reactors, I would like to point out that software tools have
currently been initiated in this area. In particular, those solutions capable of representing
both the reaction and the hydrodynamics of large ﬂuidized bed reactors are promising. This
probable includes combining existing ideas as it is done for computational particle ﬂuid
dynamics (CPFD) modeling. Simpler modeling solutions are often too vague and neglect
relevant factors such as the coalescence of bubbles, whereas more detailed models calculating
interactions between single particles can only be used for very small laboratory reactors in
which the number of particles is severely limited.
