Operator
Werner Stulpe
Operator, a technical term that is used for a mapping associating elements of some
more or less abstract space uniquely with elements of the same or some other ab-
stract space. If X and Y are such spaces (e.g., vector spaces or spaces of functions),
an operator from X to Y (or from X into Y) assigns exactly one element ψ ∈Y to
every element φ belonging to some speciﬁed subset DA of X; one writes ψ = Aφ.
The set DA is called the domain of A, the set of all elements ψ ∈Y of the form
ψ = Aφ, φ ∈DA, is called the range of A. If B is a second operator from Y to Z
such that RA ⊆DB, then the product BA is deﬁned by the successive application of
A and B, i.e., BAφ = B(Aφ) where DBA = DA and RBA ⊆RB. An operator A
from X into Y is called invertible if Aφ1 = Aφ2, φ1, φ2 ∈DA, implies φ1 = φ2; in
this case the inverse operator A−1 is deﬁned to be that operator that takes ψ ∈RA,
ψ = Aφ, back to the uniquely determined φ ∈DA. So DA−1 = RA, RA−1 = DA,
and A−1ψ = φ for ψ = Aφ; furthermore, A−1Aφ = φ and AA−1ψ = ψ.
In quantum physics, linear operators acting in a complex  Hilbert space H play
a dominant role [1–7]. An operator A in H, i.e., from H to H, is called linear if (i)
DA is a linear submanifold of H, (ii) A(φ + χ) = Aφ + Aχ for all φ, χ ∈DA,
and (iii) A(λφ) = λAφ for all complex numbers λ ∈C and all φ ∈DA. As
a consequence, the range RA is also a linear submanifold of H. An operator in

H satisfying conditions (i), (ii), and (iii’) A(λφ) = λAφ where λ is the complex
conjugate of λ, is called antilinear.
A linear operator A acting in H is called bounded if ∥Aφ∥⩽c∥φ∥for some
real number c ⩾0 and all φ ∈DA (for the deﬁnition of the norm ∥φ∥of a vector
φ ∈H,  Hilbert space). A (not necessarily linear) operator A is continuous if from
∥φn −φ∥→0 as n →∞, φn ∈DA, and φ ∈DA it follows that ∥Aφn −Aφ∥→0
as n →∞. A linear operator is continuous if and only if it is bounded. A (not
necessarily linear) operator A is said to be closed if from ∥φn −φ∥→0 as n →∞,
φn ∈DA, and ∥Aφn −ψ∥→0 as n →∞it follows that φ ∈DA and ψ = Aφ.
Since the closure of the linear submanifold DA is a Hilbert space itself, we can
assume that either DA = H or that DA ̸= H is dense in H ( Hilbert space). So,
for linear operators, the following cases can be distinguished:
1. DA = H and A is bounded. Then A is continuous and closed.
2. DA = H and A is closed. Then, according to the so-called closed-graph theorem,
A is bounded and continuous.
3. DA = H and A is not bounded (equivalently, not continuous, resp., not closed).
This possible case is only of pathological interest.
4. DA ̸= H, DA is dense in H, and A is bounded. Then A is continuous, not closed,
but can uniquely be extended to a bounded linear operator deﬁned on H.
5. DA ̸= H, DA is dense in H, and A is not bounded (resp., not continuous), but
closed.
6. DA ̸= H, DA is dense in H, and A is not bounded and not closed. Such an
operator can be closable, i.e., A can have a closed extension. A closable operator
A always has a smallest closed extension, called its closure A.
For a bounded linear operator A in H, the smallest number c such that ∥Aφ∥⩽
c∥φ∥holds for all φ ∈DA, is called its operator norm ∥A∥. Let B(H) be the set of
all bounded linear operators deﬁned on H (i.e., DA = H). According to (A+B)φ =
Aφ+Bφ and (λA)φ = λAφ where A, B ∈B(H), λ ∈C, and φ ∈H, an addition of
the operators of B(H) and a multiplication by numbers is deﬁned. So B(H) becomes
a complex vector space and, equipped with the operator norm, a complex Banach
space ( Hilbert space). Moreover, since operators A, B ∈B(H) can be multiplied,
the product AB being an element of B(H) satisfying ∥AB∥⩽∥A∥∥B∥, B(H) is a
Banach algebra with some additional structure ( algebraic quantum mechanics).
An operator A ∈B(H) is called compact if, for a bounded sequence of vectors
φn ∈H, the sequence Aφn contains a convergent subsequence. The set C(H) of all
compact operators is a norm-closed subspace of B(H) and an ideal of B(H), i.e.,
A ∈C(H) and B ∈B(H) implies AB, BA ∈C(H).
A linear operator A in a Hilbert space H with domain DA dense in H (including
the case DA = H) is called symmetric or Hermitian if ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aφ|ψ⟩for all
φ, ψ ∈DA. A densely deﬁned linear operator in H is symmetric if and only if
the scalar products ⟨φ|Aφ⟩, φ ∈DA, are real. A symmetric operator deﬁned on H
is necessarily bounded. The concept of the symmetry of a linear operator can be
sharpened to that of self-adjointness which is deﬁned below.

Operator
A real or complex number λ is said to be an eigenvalue of a linear operator A
acting in H if there is a nonzero vector φ ∈DA such that Aφ = λφ, φ is called
an eigenvector. The set of all eigenvectors belonging to the same eigenvalue is,
together with the zero vector, a linear submanifold, the eigenspace; the eigenspaces
of A are closed if A ∈B(H) or if A is closed. Finitely many eigenvectors belonging
to different eigenvalues are linearly independent. It is possible that a linear operator
has no eigenvalues; however, it can also happen that an operator even in a separable
 Hilbert space has a continuum of eigenvalues (in this context, eigenvalues are
understood precisely as deﬁned here, the so-called improper eigenvalues are not
considered). A compact operator A ∈C(H) has at most countably many eigenvalues
with zero as only possible accumulation point where the eigenspaces belonging to
nonzero eigenvalues are ﬁnite-dimensional. A symmetric or  self-adjoint operator
in a separable Hilbert space also has at most countably many eigenvalues, these are
real and the eigenspaces are orthogonal ( Hilbert space) to each other. In general,
such an operator does not have a complete orthonormal system of eigenvectors,
instead a self-adjoint operator has a so-called spectral decomposition which is a
generalization of the case of a complete orthonormal system of eigenvectors and
which is essential for quantum mechanics.
(Spectral decomposition, see  Density operator; Ignorance interpretation; Mea-
surement theory; Objectiﬁcation;Probabilistic Interpretation; Propensities in Quan-
tum Mechanics; Self-adjoint operator; Wave mechanics.)
Most of the concepts and statements mentioned until now are also valid for op-
erators acting in a complex or real Banach space X ( Hilbert space) or even for
operators from one Banach space X to some other Banach space Y (in the case of
a real Banach or Hilbert space, the condition λ ∈C must be replaced by λ ∈R,
and there are no antilinear operators). The eigenvalue problem, of course, makes
sense only for linear operators acting in X, and symmetric or  self-adjoint opera-
tors exist only in a Hilbert space H (in the case of a real Hilbert space, the criterion
⟨φ|Aφ⟩∈R for the symmetry of a densely deﬁned linear operator A does not ap-
ply). Furthermore, the set B(X) of all bounded linear operators deﬁned on a Banach
space X, with values in X, is a Banach algebra with a less rich structure than B(H).
In the more general context of operators between different Banach spaces, the set
B(X, Y) of all bounded linear operators deﬁned on X, with values in Y, is again a
Banach space, but no longer an algebra, and the subspace C(X, Y) of the compact
operators is not an ideal.
For a linear operator A in a Hilbert space H with dense domain DA, the adjoint
operator A∗is deﬁned as follows. The domain DA∗of A∗consists of all vectors
φ ∈H for which there exists a vector χφ such that ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨χφ|ψ⟩holds for
all ψ ∈DA; since DA is dense in H, χφ is uniquely determined, and A∗φ = χφ,
φ ∈DA∗, concludes the deﬁnition of A∗. In particular, ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨A∗φ|ψ⟩for all
ψ ∈DA and all φ ∈DA∗. The adjoint A∗is a closed linear operator, but the linear
submanifold DA∗is in general not dense in H; in fact, DA∗is dense if and only if
A is closable in which case A = A∗∗(by deﬁnition, A∗∗= (A∗)∗). For A ∈B(H),
A∗is also bounded with domain DA∗= H. A densely deﬁned linear operator in H
is symmetric if and only if A∗is an extension of A (brieﬂy written as A ⊆A∗), i.e.,
A∗coincides with A on DA, but possibly has a larger domain.

O
A densely deﬁned linear operator in H is called self-adjoint ( self-adjoint op-
erator) if A = A∗, i.e., ⟨φ|Aψ⟩= ⟨Aφ|ψ⟩for all φ, ψ ∈DA = DA∗. A bounded
self-adjoint operator must necessarily be deﬁned on H. For a linear operator deﬁned
on H, the concepts of symmetry and self-adjointness are equivalent; a self-adjoint
operator deﬁned on H is bounded. A self-adjoint operator A ∈B(H) is said to be
positive, brieﬂy written as A ⩾0, if ⟨φ|Aφ⟩⩾0 for all φ ∈H. If A ∈B(H) is
positive, the equation B2 = BB = A has a unique positive solution B ∈B(H);
B is called the square root of A and is denoted by B = A
1
2 . The set Bs(H) of all
bounded self-adjoint operators on H form a real Banach space; deﬁning A ⩽B for
A, B ∈Bs(H) by B −A ⩾0, Bs(H) becomes partially ordered, in fact, Bs(H) is
an ordered Banach space.
For a positive operator A ∈Bs(H), the  trace tr A = ∞
i=1⟨φi|Aφi⟩is well-
deﬁned, i.e., independent of the complete orthonormal system φ1, φ2, . . . of H (in
this context, assume that H is an inﬁnite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert
space, the ﬁnite-dimensional case is trivial); tr A can be inﬁnite. An arbitrary op-
erator A ∈B(H) is called a trace-class operator if tr (A∗A)
1
2 < ∞(observe that
A∗A ⩾0). For a trace-class operator, the trace tr A = ∞
i=1⟨φi|Aφi⟩exists and
is well-deﬁned. The set C1(H) of all trace-class operators is a linear submanifold
of B(H) and, equipped with the trace norm ∥A∥1 = tr (A∗A)
1
2 , a complex Ba-
nach space. The trace deﬁnes a linear functional on C1(H) (i.e., a linear operator
with range C) which satisﬁes tr A∗= tr A. If A ∈C1(H) and B ∈B(H), then
AB, BA ∈C1(H) where tr AB = tr BA and |tr AB| ⩽∥A∥1∥B∥. Moreover, ac-
cording to &B(A) = tr AB a bounded linear functional &B on the Banach space
C1(H), i.e., an element of the dual space (C1(H))∗, is deﬁned, and by virtue of
the association B →&B the spaces B(H) and (C1(H))∗are norm-isomorphic.—
The space C1
s (H) of the self-adjoint trace-class operators is, by means of the trace
norm and the partial order inherited from Bs(H), an ordered real Banach space. If
A ∈C1
s (H) and B ∈Bs(H), then tr AB is real and the dual space (C1
s (H))∗is
norm-isomorphic to Bs(H).
A Hilbert–Schmidt operator is an element A ∈B(H) for which tr A∗A < ∞.
The set C2(H) of all Hilbert-Schmidt operators is a Hilbert space where the scalar
product is given by ⟨A|B⟩= tr A∗B, A, B ∈C2(H); so the Hilbert-Schmidt norm
reads ∥A∥2 = (tr A∗A)
1
2 . The following statements hold: C1(H) ⊆C2(H) ⊆
C(H) ⊆B(H); C1(H), C2(H), and C(H) are linear submanifolds as well as ideals
of the algebra B(H); whereas C(H) is closed w.r.t. the operator norm, C1(H) and
C2(H) are not closed (provided that dim H = ∞), but dense in C(H); for the Ba-
nach spaces (C1(H), ∥· ∥1), (C2(H), ∥· ∥2), (C(H), ∥· ∥), and (B(H), ∥· ∥) the
dualities (C(H))∗∼= C1(H), (C1(H))∗∼= B(H), and (C2(H))∗∼= C2(H) are valid.
Like linear operators acting in a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space, operators A ∈
B(H) have matrix representations. Assume that H is an inﬁnite-dimensional sepa-
rable Hilbert space; let φ1, φ2, . . . be a complete orthonormal system in H. Then,
for χ ∈H, χ = ∞
i=1 αiφi and ψ = Aχ = ∞
i=1 βiφi where αi = ⟨φi|χ⟩
and βi = ⟨φi|Aχ⟩. Moreover, βi =

j=1⟨φi|Aφj⟩αj.
The complex numbers aij = ⟨φi|Aφj⟩are called the matrix elements of A w.r.t.

φ1, φ2, . . ., and βi = ∞

where the column
vectors are elements of the Hilbert space l2 since ∥ψ∥2 = ∞
i=1 |αi|2 < ∞and
∥Aψ∥2 = ∞
i=1 |βi|2 < ∞.—If A is an unbounded operator with domain DA
dense in H, then ψ = Aχ, χ ∈DA, has a matrix representation w.r.t. φ1, φ2, . . .
whenever φ1, φ2, . . . belongs to DA as well as to DA∗. Moreover, φ1, φ2, . . . ∈DA∗
and φ1, φ2, . . . ∈DA entail that DA∗is dense in H, A∗∗= A exists, and
φ1, φ2, . . . ∈DA∗∗. So the action of A∗can also be represented in matrix form, the
matrix elements a∗
ij of A∗satisfy a∗
ij = aji. In particular, every symmetric or self-
adjoint operator enables a matrix representation of ψ = Aχ if χ, φ1, φ2, . . . ∈DA.
The matrix elements of a symmetric or self-adjoint operator satisfy aij = aji, i.e.,
the matrix elements constitute a Hermitian matrix.
