We present a new paradigm for dark matter in which a dark matter asymmetry is established
in the early universe that is then transferred to ordinary matter. We show this scenario can ﬁt
naturally into weak scale physics models, with a dark matter candidate mass of this order. We
present several natural suppression mechanisms, including bleeding dark matter number density
into lepton number, which occur naturally in models with lepton-violating operators transferring
the asymmetry that reduce the number density and allow for dark matter much heavier than baryon
masses.
I.
INTRODUCTION
After years of study, the nature of dark matter remains a mystery. While we hope that data will soon decide the
issue, at the moment we have only theoretical clues and experimental constraints. Thermal freeze-out calculations
suggest a connection to the weak energy scale as stable weak scale particles have approximately the right abundance
to be viable candidates for dark matter. However, we don’t yet know whether the weakly interacting, massive particle
(WIMP) hypothesis is correct.
In particular, detailed calculations point to tunings that are essential in explicit
WIMP examples in order to get a thermal abundance in agreement with observations, while recent theoretical work
has presented many new non-canonical dark matter candidates that oﬀer viable alternatives to the WIMP paradigm.
Given the uncertainties in the nature of dark matter, it is worth noting another remarkable coincidence: the
closeness of the dark matter energy density to that of ordinary matter, diﬀering by only a factor of about six. This
remarkable fact is suggestive of an underlying connection between the origin of both baryons and dark matter.
This relationship has been exploited in models of Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) (see Refs. [1–11] and more
recently, in Refs. [12–16]), in which dark matter has essentially the same number density as ordinary matter. In
accordance with the measured energy densities, this requires the dark matter to be light – approximately 5 −10 GeV.
In most of these models, it is assumed that a baryon asymmetry is created and somehow transferred to dark matter,
although very recent papers suggest the opposite [17–19].
In this paper we present an alternative framework in a very general scenario that we call “Xogenesis.” In such models,
a dark matter asymmetry (consisting of a particle X) is created that is transferred through dark matter-ordinary
matter interactions to the Standard Model (SM) sector. In this paper, we don’t present explicit mechanisms for dark
matter asymmetry creation, but simply note that many mechanisms of baryogenesis have obvious generalizations to a
non-Standard Model sector, presumably with fewer constraints given dark matter’s inaccessibility. We leave explicit
realizations of this aspect to future work.
A key diﬀerence in our approach compared to Refs. [17–19] is that we assume the dark matter candidate particle
is heavy, with mass at or around the weak scale. The biggest potential objection to such dark matter is that it would
seem to require exponential tuning to get the necessary suppression of dark matter number density so that the energy
in dark matter is not too high. However, this is not the case. Thermal suppression turns on relatively slowly, with
exponential behavior becoming apparent only when mass scales diﬀer by more than an order of magnitude. When
mass scales are within a natural range – diﬀering by an order of magnitude or so – the correct dark matter density
is readily achievable. Of course, getting the dark matter density precisely right requires a speciﬁc relation among
parameters. But this is not a violation of naturalness [20], but merely a ﬁtting of parameters. For any value in this
range, one would ﬁnd reasonably equivalent energy densities of dark matter and ordinary matter. This is illustrated
in Figure 1, where we show the relative density of dark and ordinary matter as a function of the ratio of the dark
matter mass to the decoupling temperature. We see a broad regime where the function is approximately linear. We
also note that this mechanism seems to favor lower decoupling temperature for the lightest and most natural dark
matter candidates.
As stated, in this paper we simply assume early Universe processes create a dark matter asymmetry. The models
we present contain mechanisms for transferring the asymmetry to ordinary matter and we study the constraints this
imposes. We have considered several possible classes of transfer mechanisms. Broadly speaking, we divide these
into models in which dark matter is charged under SU(2)L and transfers the asymmetry to ordinary matter via
sphalerons, models in which both ordinary matter and dark matter are charged under some new gauge group and
exotic sphalerons transfer the asymmetry, models in which B-violating operators transfer the asymmetry, and models
in which L-violating operators do the job.

FIG. 1: The ratio of dark matter energy density ρDM to baryon energy density ρB as a function of dark matter mass mX in
units of the temperature at which the B −X transfer decouples TD, for labeled values of TD. As light solution (corresponding
to mX/TD ∼0 is not shown. See Section II and Eq. (6) for detailed explanation. The observed ratio of ρDM/ρB is 5.86 [21].
These mechanisms have been successfully applied to generate the relevant energy densities in the context of an
existing baryon asymmetry being transferred to light dark matter, though mechanisms named darkogenesis [17] and
hylogenesis [18] have also been suggested which transfer the asymmetry in the opposite direction. If, on the other
hand, dark matter is not relativistic at the temperature TD at which the X-transfer operators decouple, then the
number density of dark matter is suppressed. In general, we ﬁnd when the ratio mX/TD is about 10, we get the
required density of dark matter compared to baryons in the Universe. This thermal suppression is a generic feature,
allowing heavy dark matter in many scenarios of Xogenesis.
We also discuss two other reasons that dark matter number density might be suppressed relative to baryon number
so that dark matter can naturally be weak scale in mass.. In the ﬁrst, the SU(2)L sphaleron transfer is only active for
a bounded temperature range between the masses of two doublets whose net number density would cancel if they were
degenerate [22]. In the second, excess X-number is bled oﬀinto leptons. That is, even after the baryon asymmetry
is established (possibly at the sphaleron temperature where a lepton asymmetry gets transferred into an asymmetry
in the baryon sector), X- and lepton-number violating operators are still in thermal equilibrium allowing X number
density to be reduced while lepton number density is increased. Both these mechanisms cause the transfer to baryons
to not be active for the entire temperature range down to TD when the X-number violating operators decouple.
Xogenesis models must also remove the symmetric thermally produced dark matter component, so that the asym-
metric component dominates. When the transfer mechanism is due to higher order operators, the operators necessary
to transfer the asymmetry may also lead to the annihilation of this component. In other examples, new interactions
are assumed, which in some cases also lead to detectable signatures. A new non-abelian W ′ with masses much below
mW allows the dark matter to annihilate into dark gauge bosons, but with few – if any – direct detection constraints
and probably no visible signatures in the near future. Annihilation via a light Z′ that mixes with the photon allows
the chance for direct detection, depending on the size of the mixing parameter. While not strictly necessary, the
photon-Z′ mixing is a generic property, and may be accessible in beam experiments [23].
We also note one additional constraint that applies to supersymmetric models in which higher dimension operators
link X to L or B via the lepton or baryon superpartners.
In these cases, the neutralinos that come from the
superpartner decay must also be eliminated via self-annihilation. This generally implies that the neutralino should
be primarily wino so that the annihilation cross section is suﬃciently large to make the neutralino component of dark
matter a small percentage of the total.

II.
TRANSFER MECHANISMS
The scenario we propose is quite general. We illustrate the idea with four classes of baryon-dark matter transfer
scenarios: SU(2)L sphalerons, sphalerons of a new gauge group, and higher-dimensional operators that violate either
lepton or baryon number. In each case, chemical equilibrium between dark matter and baryons is maintained until
the operators that transfer the dark matter X number into baryon number B decouple at a temperature TD. Since
the net number density ni −¯ni of particle species i is proportional to its chemical potential µi, the equality of µX and
µB would seem to imply nX ∼nB (up to O(1) numbers that depend on the details of a particular model). Indeed
a solution of this sort generally exists when mX ∼5 −6mproton. However, the equation for net number density of
particle i (with gi degrees of freedom) at temperature T and scale factor R(T) tells us the relationship is more subtle
ni = gif(mi/T)T 2R(T)3µi.

measures the departure from thermal equilibrium of the particle. If the ratio of dark matter mass mX to TD is large,
then as the transfer operator decouples, the dark matter itself is going out of thermal equilibrium, and has suppressed
number density (f(mi/TD) →0 as mi/TD →∞). This results in a lower nX than would occur if mX ≪TD, and
thus in order to get the right energy density of dark matter a larger dark matter mass is allowed. It should also be
noted that the number density is can continue to loosely track the equilibrium number density even after decoupling
(that is, the number density to entropy ratio Y (TD) ̸= Y∞). Therefore, we can expect some additional dilution of the
dark matter number density from TD to the present day. For the purposes of this paper, we ignore this eﬀect.1
We see that for a model with a particular value of TD, two mX solutions that give the correct dark matter density
typically exist: mX ∼5 GeV (the relativistic solution), and mX ∼10TD (the non-relativistic solution), though
additional scenarios with even lower ratio of mX to TD are possible, as we outline below. As the details of a particular
model tend to aﬀect only the proportionality constant between µX and µB, the non-relativistic solution (dependent
as it is on an exponential suppression) is relatively model independent. We now present this calculation.
A.
SU(2)L Sphalerons
We begin with perhaps the simplest model, in which the dark matter particle XL is an SU(2)L fermionic doublet
with hypercharge +1/2. The simplest version of this model is ruled out by direct detection constraints, however it
is remains useful as a demonstration of the general Xogenesis technique. We shall then consider modiﬁcations of the
simple SU(2)L sphaleron model that evade direct detection constraints.
In this ﬁrst model, there must be a second fermion charged under SU(2)L to avoid an SU(2) anomaly [24]. This
second state can be either heavier or lighter (in latter case it must be unstable). Here we will consider only the state
relevant to dark matter. In order to give mass to both the charged and neutral states of this chiral fermion, there
must be two SU(2)L singlets as well: ¯X0
S and ¯X−

As we shall see, this simplest model violates bounds from direct detection (note that adding a ∼100 keV Majorana
mass to allow for inelastic scattering does not work, as such mass terms violate the X symmetry). We will address
possible solutions to this issue later, but proceed with the simple model to demonstrate the general calculations in an
Xogenesis scenario.
Since the left-handed fermion is charged under SU(2)L, dark matter can be created and destroyed in the SU(2)L
sphaleron. In the SM, the action of the sphaleron creates or destroys baryons and leptons, while preserving the linear
combination B −L. Generalizing to NX families of dark matter (that is, NX SU(2)L doublets), we see that the

linear combination B −3/NXX is also preserved. Therefore, the action of the sphaleron enforces chemical equilibrium
between X and the quarks, with
µXL = −3NXµuL.

Combining Eqs. (1) for baryons and dark matter with Eq. (4), and assuming massless quarks, we ﬁnd that

Here, TD is the temperature at which the sphaleron is no longer active. Exact calculation of this value is diﬃcult, so
for the purposes of this paper, we assume that it occurs at the Higgs vev v ∼200 GeV.
Eq. (6) must be solved numerically. Taking the current WMAP values for the energy density of dark matter and
baryons, the ratio ρDM

= 5.86. In Fig. 2, we plot the left- and right-hand sides of Eq. (6) for NX = 1, 2, 3. The
solution for NX = 1 is mX ∼1800 GeV, or 9TD. As can be seen, the value of mX which provides the correct dark
matter density depends only weakly on the O(1) number in the equations for chemical equilibrium (in this case, 3NX).

FIG. 2: Numeric solution to Eq. (6, for one, two, or three fermionic dark matter doublets (NX = 1, 2, 3) and assuming a SU(2)L
sphaleron decoupling temperature TD = 200 GeV. The blue dotted line is the left-handed side of Eq. (6), i.e. f(mX/TD).
For the model to work, we require both a suﬃcient number of baryons from an initial dark matter asymmetry (while
maintaining the observed dark matter density) created by the sphaleron, and a suﬃcient suppression of the thermal
component. Some process must act to eﬃciently annihilate the thermal symmetric dark matter number density. In
the current example, it is natural to consider annihilation through SU(2)L interactions. However the cross section
for this process is too small; an SU(2)L fermion produces the dark matter density when mX ∼1 TeV; larger masses
yield too much thermal dark matter [25].
In order for the sphaleron to change the net X number, the dark matter must be chiral, and so a coupling to the
SM Higgs is necessary to provide a mass term, as in Eq. (3). The large mass required to match observations of ρDM
requires a yX ∼10 – near the perturbativity limit. Although perhaps theoretically undesirable, such a large Yukawa
yields an eﬃcient annihilation of X ¯X pairs into SM fermions. The thermal abundance is given by [26]
ΩDMh2 ≈

(7)
where xf = mX/Tf ∼20 is the ratio of mass to temperature at freeze-out, g∗is the number of degrees of freedom
active at Tf, and a and b are, respectively, the s- and p-wave contributions to the thermally averaged annihilation
cross section ⟨σv⟩. Roughly speaking, the observed value of ΩDM occurs when ⟨σv⟩is 1 pb. For X ¯X →t¯t, via the

Therefore Higgs-mediated annihilation suﬃces to remove the symmetric component in this scenario.
The required mass as derived in Eq. (6) places us in direct conﬂict with direct detection experiments. The null
results from XENON100 [27] and CDMS-II [28] rule out neutral component of a SU(2)L doublet in the 100 GeV–
TeV mass range by ∼4 orders of magnitude. The presence of a ∼10 keV mass splitting induced by a mixing with
a Majorana singlet would evade this constraint [29, 30], however such a mechanism would destroy the X-number
asymmetry and so cannot be present in this model.
Mixing with Dirac singlet can reduce the direct detection signal by an amount proportional to the fourth power of
the doublet component ϵ of the lightest state in the dark sector. Hence, to avoid conﬂict with experiment, ϵ must be
≲10−1. However, a dark sector consisting of one left-handed doublet XL and a Dirac singlet X1 will have two mass
eigenvalues, the lightest of which has ϵ ≳1
2.
We therefore consider the simplest dark sector that captures the necessary phenomenology: a left-handed doublet
XL, and three Dirac gauge singlets: one left-handed (X1) and two right-handed (X2 and X3). After EWSB, the most
general Dirac mass matrix for the neutral states is given by the Lagrangian
L ⊇y1vXL ¯X2 + y2vXL ¯X3 + m12X1 ¯X2 + m13X1 ¯X3 + h.c.
(10)
Of course, arbitrary choices of the parameters y1, y2, m12, and m13 will not provide three non-zero mass eigenstates
with a lightest state that has a suﬃciently small doublet component.
One possible choice of parameters is as follows: deﬁne y1v ≡M (this will become the mass scale of the primarily
doublet states), the small parameter ϵ is deﬁned as y1/y2, and we choose m13 ∼0 and m12 ∼ϵM. Then the lightest
state is a linear combination of ∼ϵXL + ϵX1 + X2 and has a mass ∼ϵ2M.
With these parameters, the action of the sphaleron in the early Universe is to create (1 −ϵ2/2)2 particles of mass
M, and ϵ4 particles of mass ϵ2M. The heavy states will then decay, leaving only the light dark matter in the Universe
today. From Eq. (1), the correct amount of dark matter is found when
ϵ2f(ϵ2M/TD) + (1 −ϵ2)f(M/TD) = f(0)ρDM
ρB

ϵ2M
.
(11)
Solutions to this equation only exist when ϵ ≳0.16, in which case M ∼400 GeV, resulting in dark matter with
mass ϵ2M ∼9 GeV (see Fig. 3). In such a mass regime, the strictest constraints come from measurements of the
invisible Z width, which require ϵ ≤0.23. Amusingly, with the choice of ϵ = 0.2, two solutions to Eq. (11) exist,
M ∼150 GeV and M ∼850 GeV – natural masses, in light of our expectations of new physics at the weak scale.
The ﬁrst solution has a dark matter candidate with mass of 6 GeV and the appropriate cross section to explain the
CoGeNT and DAMA/Libra direct detection anomalies. However, adding non-negligible mass terms m12 and m13 can
alter the mass relations of the light state, and we have not proposed any mechanism that explains our arbitrary choice
of parameters.
B.
SU(2)R Sphalerons
We have seen that SU(2)L sphalerons are a promising way to transfer an initial X asymmetry into baryons. Such
processes are already known to exchange baryons and leptons, so no new interactions are required. However, additional
singlet ﬁelds are necessary to avoid direct detection bounds. In addition, the non-relativistic solution to the chemical
equilibrium forces the dark matter mass to be very large compared to the sphaleron decoupling temperature TD,
requiring a large Yukawa coupling at the border of perturbativity or the presence of additional right handed states.
Transfer via a sphaleron of some additional gauge group avoids the ﬁrst limitation, but does not solve the second.
A new non-abelian gauge group with chiral representations in both the SM and the dark sector would move an
X asymmetry into the visible sector, analogous to the SU(2)L case. As in the SU(2)L example, the right-handed
sphaleron would be active down to a temperature TD which we assume to similar to the vev of the SU(2)R-breaking
Higgs ﬁeld TD ∼⟨Φ⟩≡vR. Experimental constraints tell us that MWR > 4 TeV, assuming that the gauge bosons

couple to all three generations of the SM. As these masses are related to the vev by vR = 2MR/gR, assuming a
perturbative gauge coupling, vR (and thus TD) must be heavier than ∼8 TeV. In a SUSY model, cancellations in the
FCNCs can reduce the bound to 4 TeV [31]. If only the third generation coupled to the new gauge force, then the
bounds are much weaker. Assuming coupling to γ/Z, LEP-II places a bound of 105 GeV on MWR, and thus TD must
be greater than ∼200 GeV, similar to the SU(2)L example.

For Nf = 3 and NX = 1, TD ∼8 TeV and
mX ∼52 TeV. For only the third generation coupling, the non-relativistic solution for NX = 1 is mX ∼1500 GeV. In
both cases, the Yukawa couplings yX are again O(10).
C.
Left-Right Annihilation
In the previous sections we found that minimal sphaleron models require a non-perturbative Yukawa coupling for
the dark matter candidate. In the SU(2)L case, we are able to avoid this constraint and evade direct detection bounds
by the addition of light singlets. Here we present a second model that avoids the large Yukawa problem; one that
establishes the right dark matter density even if mX/TD is much less than O(10). Asymmetries are still exchanged
via SU(2)R sphalerons, but we assume in addition to a single left-handed doublet charged under SU(2)R there is also
a second right-handed doublet as well as a massive singlet.2 In the absence of the singlet, the sphaleron would create
a left-handed particle XL and destroy a right-handed particle XR. As a result, the X number would not be changed
by the sphaleron, and no Xogenesis could occur.
With the addition of the singlet, the three ﬁelds can mix. For simplicity, we assume only singlet-XR coupling, so
the neutral Lagrangian is
L ⊇mLRXL ¯XR + yXSφ ¯XR + mSXS ¯XS + h.c.
(13)
Including a Higgs vev, the mixing mass term becomes mR ≡yv. Assuming mLR, mR ≪mS, the two light eigenstates
(X1 and X2) are mLR ± m2
R/2mS and the heavy state X3 is mS + m2
R/mS.
The primarily singlet particle we deﬁne as X3 has a small mixing angle sin θ ≈mR/mS with the right-handed
doublet. Thus, if mS ≫Tsphaleron, when T ≳Tsphaleron, X3 freezes out and the sphaleron creates one unit of left-
handed ﬁeld (in a combination of X1 and X2) and destroys (1 −sin2 θ) unit of right-handed doublet (again in a
linear combination of X1 and X2). Thus, after the freeze-out of the heavy state, the sphaleron changes X number by
sin2 θ = m2
R/m2
S.
2 Graham Kribbs [22] has considered similar ideas.

7
The linear combination B −Nf sin−2 θX is preserved by the sphaleron, and so
µX = −sin2 θµuL.
(14)
Again, assuming mS ≫Tsphaleron ≈vR, which allows us to use mX ∼mLR we can relate the number density of X to
that of baryons once the sphaleron decouples:
nX = sin2 θ

(16)
Since the sphaleron creates only a small change in X number (relative to baryon number), the thermal suppression
of the dark matter number density need not be very large. This allows for lighter dark matter than the previous case.
If all three generations are coupled to SU(2)R, then the lowest vR can be is ∼4 TeV. In this case, solving Eq. (16)
numerically, we ﬁnd solutions exist when mS/mR < 14. At the critical value of the ratio, only one solution for the
dark matter mass exists, mX ∼8 TeV. For smaller ratios, two solutions exist, one lighter and one heavier than 8 TeV
(see Fig. 4).
If we assume that only the third generation couples to SU(2)R, and so Tsphaleron ∼vR can be as low as 200 GeV.
Again solving for mX in Eq. (16), we ﬁnd that no solution exists if the ratio mS/mR ≳4. At this critical point,
mX ∼400 GeV. As before, with smaller ratios two solutions exist.

(Tsphaleron = 4 TeV(200 GeV)) and an example of solutions with a smaller value of mS/mR.
This set of models avoids the problem of large Yukawa couplings, as the heavy mass mS does not arise from the
SU(2)R Higgs vev. Were it not for the direct detection bounds, a similar method could apply to Xogenesis models
involving a SU(2)L sphaleron transfer: however the singlet component of X1 necessary to achieve the correct dark
matter density is small, and so would not suppress the direct detection cross section by the large factors needed to
evade the current limits.
D.
B Violating Operators
We next consider interactions that can transfer dark matter to baryon number directly – that is, operators that
explicitly violate X number as well as either B or L. In each case, for explicitness, we consider minimal operators
in a SUSY scenario as presented in Ref. [15], though we expect many other possibilities exist. For baryon violating
operators, we assume a superpotential of the form
W ⊇

M 2 XXudd.
(17)
In the early universe when temperatures are above TD, this interaction allows the X asymmetry to be transferred
into B via squarks, which decay quickly into quarks and neutralinos. Assuming a fermionic X and m˜q > mX, the

cross section for this process is approximately

(19)
This process decouples at some temperature TD, when Γ is equivalent to the expansion rate of the Universe, ∼
20T 2/mpl. We focus on the more experimentally accessible examples with low UV completion scale M. These models
yield relatively low values of TD as well [15].
As with the generic sphaleron scenario outlined previously, the chemical equilibrium equations for the baryon
violating operator force TD ∼mX/10. Therefore, the free parameters in Eq. (19) are mX/M, and ∆m ≡3m˜q −mX.
The solution for TD depends linearly on ∆m but only logarithmically on mX/M; assuming that M is not many of
orders of magnitude larger than mX we ﬁnd a solution when ∆m ∼45TD. This implies that m˜q ∼20TD.
This still has not set an overall mass scale. From the lower bound on squark masses of ∼400 GeV [21], TD ≳20 GeV
and mX ≳200 GeV.The scale M in these scenarios was assumed to be 1 TeV. Smaller values are inconsistent with
the assumption that Eq. (17) is an eﬀective operator. Larger values are possible and only logarithmically aﬀect ∆m
and TD.
If the dark matter is instead a scalar, then the superpotential Eq. (17) will allow interactions between two scalar
X, a squark and two quarks. The calculation for the freeze-out temperature will proceed in a similar manner to
the fermionic case, with the replacement of 3m˜q −2mX with m˜q −2mX. For a given squark mass, this allows for
slightly lower TD and mX; for example, a 400 GeV squark has TD ∼6 GeV and mX ∼60 GeV with only a logarithmic
dependence on M.
The symmetric component of dark matter must of course be eliminated. The X −B transfer term in the superpo-
tential Eq. (17) by itself does not provide suﬃcient annihilation in the early Universe, so some additional structure
must be present. The two most obvious possibilities are annihilation via (pseudo-)scalars or through vector bosons.
We consider them in turn; both are capable of removing the symmetric component, though the vector scenario may
require additional structure.
We ﬁrst consider the annihilation of the symmetric dark matter through the lightest pseudo-scalar a in the NMSSM,
as discussed in Ref. [15]. We require the thermal abundance of dark matter to be much less than the full ΩDMh2 ∼0.1
observed today. This can be roughly translated as the requirement that the annihilation cross section in the early
Universe must have been ≫1 pb. As demonstrated in Ref. [15], annihilation mediated by a has a suﬃciently large
cross section provided the pseudoscalar vev is ≪200 GeV, which may lead to interesting supersymmetric physics.
This interaction also allows the possibility of a direct detection signal, with a X-nucleon elastic cross section of
σ(Xn →Xn) = 6.0 × 10−43 cm2 × g2

(20)
which, for perturbative Higgs-X couplings of O(0.1), gives a direct detection cross section about an order of magnitude
below the current best bounds from XENON100 [27] and CDMS-II [28].
The second possible annihilation scenario is via a new broken ‘dark’ gauge group, either abelian or non-abelian
(the dark forces cannot be massless [32]). In either case, the dark matter, annihilating through a Z′ or W ′, must
either go to lighter dark states (which may include the W ′ itself) or, through some small mixing, to SM ﬁelds. There
are signiﬁcant constraints on the latter scenario, while the former requires some new symmetry to prevent the dark
matter from decaying directly to the lighter state in the dark sector.
Assuming a low (≲GeV) scale mass for the gauge bosons, the thermal relic abundance is much smaller than the
total dark matter density when [33, 34]
α′ ≫10−3 

(21)
If the annihilation is into some new dark state (or in the case of non-abelian gauge groups, XX →W ′∗→W ′W ′),
then there need be no direct contact with the SM ﬁelds at low energies, and so the possibility of direct detection are
signiﬁcantly reduced. However, if the gauge group is abelian, then generically we expect some small kinetic mixing
between the Z′ and the photon parameterized by ϵ ∼10−2 −10−6 [23]. In such a scenario, the requirement of Eq. (21)
still applies, with α′ →ϵ
√
αα′.

If the Z′ mixes with the visible sector, then the dark sector can be probed not only by direct detection, but also
by beam experiments [23, 35]. The current limits from direct detection are very constraining. For example, if dark
matter consists of Dirac fermions, then the combination
√
4πα′ϵ must be less than ∼10−13 [36]. While this is in
tension with the requirements for eﬃcient annihilation, it does not necessarily rule out Z′-mediated annihilation.
Note that, in principle, the dark matter could scatter in direct detection experiments via the same baryon violating
operator that generates the asymmetry. While this is an attractive possibility that does not require the addition of
new elements to the theory, the operator in question is dimension-12 (four fermion to four fermion scattering) and
not visible, even with the low scale of M.
We note an interesting possible signature of baryon violating models ﬁrst pointed out by Ref. [18]: annihilation
of baryons with dark matter. While the interactions of Eq. (17) do allow for such diagrams, the large mass of X
compared to that of a nucleon, combined with the low velocities of dark matter in the halo means that such events
would be kinematically suppressed in direct detection experiments (or neutrino detectors such as Super-K).
As this baryon violating model is implemented in a SUSY context, we also have to verify that the neutralino
energy density is reduced to a suﬃciently low level. The X −B violating interaction creates squarks, which quickly
decay into quarks and neutralinos. This would result in a ratio of baryons to neutralinos of ∼3, if no additional
annihilation occurs. The neutralinos themselves will be in thermal equilibrium until their freeze-out temperature,
typically ∼m˜χ/20. Assuming 100 GeV masses, the neutralinos will still be in equilibrium at TD, when the baryon
violating operator decouples. As a result, we can use the standard calculations for neutralino WIMP relic abundance.
The elimination of neutralinos favors a large wino component. From Ref. [37], for example, we see that if the neutralino
is primarily wino, the contribution to dark matter from ˜χ is subdominant. The large wino component of the neutralino
seems a robust prediction of Xogenesis models based on low scale supersymmetry.
E.
L Violating Operators
Our ﬁnal example of a X transfer mechanism are lepton violating operators. Again, as in Ref. [15], we embed the
lepton violation in a SUSY model, with the follow addition to the superpotential
W ⊇1
M XXLHu
(22)
This transfers the initial X asymmetry into sneutrinos. After decaying to neutralinos and neutrinos, the asymmetry
is then transferred into B via the SU(2)L sphaleron. Assuming fermionic dark matter and TD > Tsphaleron ∼200 GeV,
both L-violating operators and sphalerons are active throughout the X −L transfer and so
µX = 33
14µuL.
(23)
This leads to the following equation which must be solved numerically
f(mX/TD) = 14f(0)

Again, the the non-relativistic solution provides the correct amount of dark matter when TD ∼mX/10. As we have
assumed TD > 200 GeV, we see that this scenario leads to very heavy dark matter, and consequently very heavy
sneutrinos.
As with the baryon violating operators, the decoupling temperature TD can be related to the masses by setting the
rate of XX →˜ν equal to the Hubble expansion. Again assuming an exponential suppression of the rate due to mass
diﬀerence between two dark matter particles and the sneutrino ∆m ≡m˜ν −2mX, the decoupling occurs when

With the vev vu ∼200 GeV, M ∼10 TeV, and the previously stated assumptions on TD and mX, we ﬁnd that the
sneutrinos themselves would need to be ∼30TD, that is, around 6 TeV.
If the dark matter is a scalar, then the X −L transfer occurs through XX →˜hν scattering. The rate is again
controlled by an exponential of e−(m˜h−mX)/TD; as in the fermionic scenario, the decoupling temperature depends only
logarithmically on M. As in the fermionic case, we again ﬁnd that the supersymmetric scale must be high; with a
higgsino mass of ∼6 TeV.

F.
Bleeding X into L
The previous subsection assumed the lepton operators decouple before the weak interaction sphalerons, implying
heavy dark matter and sneutrinos. We now consider the alternative – and more desirable – option where TD < mX <
Tsphaleron. Rather than suppress X relative to B number thermally, in this scenario the lepton number violating
operators will still be in equilibrium below the temperature at which electroweak sphalerons have shut oﬀ, allowing
X number to bleed oﬀinto neutrinos. For this reason, the X number can be naturally less than B number, even
without a larger thermal suppression factor.
The lepton violating operator is interesting in this respect. As the operator only provides chemical equilibrium
between X and L, baryon number is created only when the L number is transferred via the SU(2)L sphaleron
into B. That means that X and L number can continue to be violated, even when B number has already been
established. Above Tsphaleron, the X asymmetry is transferred to B via a combination of the L-violating operators
and the sphaleron. As there is no thermal suppression due to large mX, this sets the X and B numbers to be roughly
equivalent. For example, in a MSSM scenario,
nX(Tsphaleron) = 11
28nB.
(26)
After this initial equilibration, the sphalerons shut oﬀ. However, the dark matter still can exchange particle number
with L, via operators like that in Eq. (22). If mX ≫mproton, then most of the dark matter will have to convert into
leptons to avoid overclosing the Universe, that is the present number density of neutrinos must be nν ∼nX(Tsphaleron).
Again, using the MSSM scenario, this requirement translates into
f(mX/TD) ≈56

(27)
We solve numerically for diﬀerent values of TD. As seen in Fig. 5, for TD ≲25 GeV, there are no solutions available.
At TD ∼25 GeV, there is a single solution at mX ∼50 GeV. Above this, two solutions to Eq. (27) are found.
The ﬁrst solution is at low mass, and corresponds to the relativistic solution to the chemical equilibrium equations,
similar to the scenarios explored in Refs.[13–19]. Note our solution has a larger mass (∼25) than those found in the
previous works (∼5 −10 GeV). This is easily understood, as bleed-oﬀof number density into leptons forces each
remaining dark matter particle to be heavier to make up for the loss. It is very interesting that this simple reversal
of the hierarchy between TD and Tsphaleron can have such a large eﬀect on the predictions of dark matter mass in a
relativistic Xogenesis scenario.
The second solution is the non-relativistic one; requiring mX/TD to be O(1). Notice that this is signiﬁcantly lower
than the ratio in the generic non-relativistic solutions we found in most other models, which are of O(10). As we have
reduced the dark matter density by dumping additional particle number into the lepton sector, there does not need
to be as much of an exponential suppression – allowing a smaller mX/TD.
As in the baryon violating model, the neutralinos coming from the decay of the sneutrinos must be eliminated,
requiring the χ to be primarily wino. In addition, as pointed out by Ref. [15], the UV completion of the Eq. (22)
L-violating operator must contain new ﬁelds in either a singlet or doublet representation of SU(2)L. If the latter, the
symmetric component of dark matter can be removed via an intermediate doublet. This doublet can also induce a
signal in direct detection. The annihilation cross section is

here y′ is the doublet-lepton-X coupling. To be eﬃcient, mD/y′ must be much smaller than 300 GeV, implying a very

This is approximately three orders of magnitude below the current CDMS-
II/XENON100 bounds. Alternatively, the symmetric component of dark matter could be removed via either the
singlet Higgs or dark gauge group methods discussed in the baryon violating mechanism. The former predicts direct
detection rates approximately an order of magnitude below the current bounds, while predictions for the latter depend
on the details of mixing between the dark gauge sector and the SM.

CONCLUSION
The near coincidence of scales that follows from dark matter relic thermal abundance (the “WIMP Miracle”), has
been the primary theoretical motivation in the ﬁeld for many years. Though theoretically well-motivated, we should
remember that it has not yet been experimentally proven. In light of the many recent anomalies from direct and
indirect detection, which are diﬃcult to reconcile with the expectations of WIMP dark matter, we should continue to
seek alternative motivating principles.
The near coincidence between baryon and dark matter energy densities leads to to concept of asymmetric dark
matter, in which dark matter consists of a particle without a sizable relic density of the corresponding antiparticle.
To explain the coincidence of energy densities,, the relic number density of dark matter is related to that of baryons,
which requires operators that violate baryon and dark matter number. In this paper, we show that the energy densities
can be appropriately related in a natural framework involving a weak scale dark matter candidate, in addition to the
light asymmetric dark matter often considered (see e.g. [14, 17–19]).
With such heavy dark matter, searches are diﬃcult. Indirect detection requires additional structure to allow X −¯X
oscillations in the late Universe, and only in speciﬁc cases will direct detection be expected. If the candidate is truly
weak scale, it can be part of some larger sector detectable at the LHC, although identifying it as dark matter will
be challenging. Nonetheless, given the uncertainty in the nature of dark matter, it is worth considering further this
alternative as it seems to address one of the most striking features about the energy densities in the Universe.
