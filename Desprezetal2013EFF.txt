Abstract – Since the 1980s, the European eels’ stocks have dramatically decreased with no sign of recovery,
resulting in their classification as Critically endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species. The European
Council Regulation 1100/2007 requires that 35% of glass eels caught annually by fishing be released in European
waters for restocking. However, the efficiency of this measure on population viability has never been evaluated.
Here, we estimated demographic parameters of a stocked population of French eels using a multistate capture–
recapture model. Using these estimates, we then estimated population size and predicted the number of future
genitors obtained by stocking. We found that the stage in which eels were stocked did not influence their future
survival and that the maximal number of silver eels was quickly reached, after 3 years following stocking. We
concluded that stocking experiments in the Mediterranean region are efficient for fast production of genitors. We
suggest that further studies should assess the quality of these genitors.
Key words: Anguilla anguilla; multistate capture-recapture models; demographic studies; restocking programmes
Introduction
The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is one of the
scarce freshwater species widely fished by profes-
sional fishermen. Its fishing represents crucial eco-
nomic incomes for European fishermen that make
the future survival of the species a major concern.
However, since the 1980s, a 50% decline in Euro-
pean eels’ stocks and an up to 99% decrease in
glass eel (life stage attained when larvae reach the
European coasts) recruitment have been observed
on the whole distribution area (Feunteun 2002;
ICES 2010) with no sign of recovery. Several
causes for this decline have been proposed such as
climatic variation, habitat loss (Kettle et al. 2011)
and degradation (by the placement of barriers in the
migration routes such as dams, sluices, and gauging
structures), pollution with PCB’s, infections with
the swimbladder parasite and overfishing (Pujolar
et al. 2011). As a result, the European eel has been
classified as critically endangered in the IUCN Red
List of Threatened Species.
To encourage the recovery of the European eel
stocks, the European Council Regulation (No 1100/
2007 published in September 2007) required all
member states that contain natural habitats of the
European eel to establish eel management plans. The
objective was to enable the escapement to the sea of
at least 35% of the silver eel biomass, relative to the
pristine estimated stock levels (i.e. pristine recruit-
ment levels) and in the absence of human influences.
To do so, several measures have been proposed
including, among others, restocking. The aim of
restocking is to supplement the existing population
by producing more silver eels (also referred to as
genitors) from the addition of young eels to a water

body from another source. Mediterranean wetlands
are good candidates for such experiments because
eels’ growth is faster than in central and northern
Europe (Sved€ang et al. 1996; Acou et al. 2003) and
the distance to the Sargasso Sea (the reproduction
area) is much smaller than from northern Europe.
However, very few studies have been conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness and suitability of such
measure. In particular, there is a lack of quantitative
studies that would help in formulating advice on if,
when, where and how much to stock (WGEEL2009/
2010). In this context, the use of population dynam-
ics tools for estimating demographic parameters is
crucial in population management. It allows the
assessment of the population variation over time, as
well as the evaluation of the impacts of management
practices and the effectiveness of conservation strate-
gies, which is especially important in the case of a
critically endangered species.
In 2007, a conservation stocking experiment was
launched in the marsh Vigueirat in south-east of
Arles (France) to assess the long-term restocking
efficiency in producing silver eels of good quality
(with none or low prevalence of the parasite Anguilli-
coloides crassus (Palstra et al. 2007), low pollutant’s
load, especially PCBs and cadmium (Palstra et al.
2006; Pierron et al. 2008), and high lipid content
(>20%, Belpaire et al. 2009)). Glass eels and individ-
ually marked elvers and yellow eels from different
origins were stocked to evaluate the potential number
of future genitors (silver eels) and their biological
quality. The first step in doing so was to quantify sur-
vival and transition between stages in this population.
However, estimating survival and life stage transi-
tions is difficult because not all individuals can be
captured
(Gimenez
et al.
2008).
Besides,
stage-
related individual heterogeneity in the detection pro-
cess can lead, if ignored, to inaccurate estimates. In
this study, we used a multistate capture–recapture
model (Lebreton et al. 2009) to estimate stage-spe-
cific survival and transition rates between stages and
identified factors affecting these parameters while
accounting for detection less than one. These results
were then used to assess the eel stocking experiment
efficiency by a) estimating population size and b)
predicting the number of silver eels obtained by
stocking.
Material and methods
Study species
The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a catadro-
mous and semelparous fish. Born in the Sargasso
Sea, the larval-stage eel drift across the Atlantic
Ocean towards the Mediterranean Sea on the current
of the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift. When-
ever approaching the Mediterranean shores, they go
through metamorphosis into glass eels (between Jan-
uary and April, Lefebvre et al. 2003) at 350 days to
2 years of age on average (Wang & Tzeng 2000;
Kettle & Haines 2006). As glass eels migrate
upstream,
they
progressively
become
more
pig-
mented, or ‘elvers’, and after a few months, develop
into ‘yellow eels’. This stage is characterised by a
growth stage during which eels become relatively
sedentary.
Yellow
eels
spend
the
next
years
(3–8 years for males and 5–12 years for females)
feeding and growing. Whenever mature, they start
their downstream migration to the ocean for spawn-
ing (Tesch 2003) as ‘silver eels’.
Study area
The ‘Pisci-Sud’ freshwater pond (salinity = 0 g l1)
is located in the Vigueirat marsh in south-east of
Arles, River Rh^one Delta (France). It is a 32-ha
basin, which is totally closed preventing eels stocked
from escaping. The basin is divided into a dense
reedbed of 20.5 ha and two closed interconnected
ponds of 6 ha and 50 cm deep and 5.5 ha and 25 cm
deep. According to previous isotopic studies, eels’
main preys in Piscisud were chironomids, the fish
Pseudorasbora parva and the Louisiana crayfish Pro-
cambarus clarkii (unpublished data). The period
during when eels were active in the basin (tempera-
ture above 8°C) varied between 177 and 249 days a
year with a mean temperature between 19.05 and
19.63°C.
Data collection
In October 2007, three groups were stocked (Table 1).
Groups Vacc1 and Vacc2 were collected from the
brackish
Vaccares
lagoon
(salinity = 22.0 
2.9 g l1), whereas group Grau1 was collected from a
freshwater canal (salinity = 1.8  0.09 g l1) near
Grau de la Fourcade fish-pass (Crivelli et al. 2008).
Eels belonging to groups Vacc1 and Grau 1 were
<300 mm long, whereas eels from the group Vacc2
were >300 mm long. Silvering stages of stocked eels
were assigned according to the EELREP index
(Table 2) based on length, weight, eye diameter and
pectoral fin length. All individuals from groups Vacc1
and Grau1 were classified as sexually undifferentiated
eels while individuals from group Vacc2 were classi-
fied as yellow eels (most) and sexually undifferenti-
ated eels. Prior stocking, eels were individually
marked with transponders (PIT tags). Beginning in
January 2008, 2.5 kg of glass eels captured from the
Grau de la Fourcade fish-pass was stocked each year
(Table 1) and batch marked with tetracycline.

Two samplings consisting of nine consecutive
days, in April–May and October, were conducted
each year from 2008 until May 2011. Eels were cap-
tured by passive trapping using different nets: six
‘capetchades’ nets (which consist of a barrier leading
into an enclosure surrounded by 3 trap nets and
which keep alive the fish and shell-fish which get
into them) with a 6 mm mesh size in the funnel and
a leading net of 40 m, 13 fyke nets with a 6 mm
mesh size, and 5 capetchade nets with a 0.5 mm
mesh size in the funnel and a leading net of 20 m.
The use of different mesh sizes allowed the capture
of all eels regardless their length (Bevacqua et al.
2007, 2009). The nets were arranged at the same
location for each sampling and were visited every
morning. The fishing effort for one sampling period
was equal throughout the years. All captured eels
were anaesthetised with phenoxyethanol, measured,
weighed and their EELREP stage determined. To
check whether the individual was already marked, we
used a handheld reader, which reads radio frequency
identification tags. If unequipped and <160 mm
length, eel was marked by caudal fin removal or, if
>160 mm, with PIT tag. Regarding the glass eels
cohort
assignment,
we
considered
that
a
small
unmarked eel (<250 mm) caught during the sampling
following the stocking of a given cohort belonged to
this cohort. Migrant eels (Table 2) were sacrificed for
analyses to determine the future genitor quality (para-
site Anguillicoloides crassus presence, pollutants and
lipid content) and to validate the cohort assignment
(otoliths analysis and use of the tetracycline mark).
Captured eels were placed in a net until the end of
the sampling period and were released in Pisci-Sud
the last day of the sampling period.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using multistate capture–recap-
ture models (Lebreton et al. 2009) considering four
different stages: sexually undifferentiated eels (E),
yellow eel (Y), silver eel (S) and dead eel (D). The
temporal dynamics of stages was governed by transi-
tion probabilities (w). For females, we considered
transitions from sexually undifferentiated eels to
yellow eel and from yellow to silver eel. For males,
as transitions from sexually undifferentiated eels to
yellow eel and then from yellow eel to silver eel
occur too quickly for being seen in the field, we only
considered a direct transition from sexually undiffer-
entiated eels to silver eels. A yellow eel could not
return to the sexually undifferentiated eels’ stage:
transition probability from stages Y to E was fixed to
0. Similarly, a silver eel could not return to sexually

Table 2. Protocol for determining stages according to EELREP (2005). The
so-called silver index* allows determining the ‘degree of silvering’ of eels
(Anguilla anguilla). There are five stages for females and two for males. An
eel was considered as ‘sexually undifferentiated eels’ when its EELREP
stage was missing (which occurred when an eel was too small for its
EELREP stage to be determined) or I, ‘yellow eel’ when EELREP stage was
FII or FIII and ‘silver eel’ for EELREP stages FIV, FV and MII.

*The silver index is based on the following external body measurements:
total body length (L), body weight (W), pectoral fin length (FL), and mean
eye diameter (MD) that is calculated according to: MD = (vertical eye diam-
eter + horizontal eye diameter)/2. To assign a stage to an eel, the following
quantities need to be calculated: SI = 61.276 + 0.242 L  0.108 W
+ 5.546 MD + 0.614 FL; SFII = 87.995 + 0.286 L  0.125 W + 6.627
MD + 0.838 FL; SFIII =  109.014 + 0.280 L  0.127 W + 9.108 MD +
1.182 FL; SFIV = 113.556 + 0.218 L  0.103 W + 12.187 MD + 1.230 FL;
SFV = 128.204 + 0.242 L  0.136 W + 12.504
MD + 1.821
FL;
SMII = 84.672 + 0.176 L  0.116 W + 12.218
MD + 1.295
FL.
The
highest S corresponds to the stage of the eel. For example, an eel with the
following
characteristics:
L = 838 mm,
W = 945 g,
MD = 10.1 mm,
FL = 41.7 mm will obtain the following scores: SI = 121.08, SFII = 135.43,
SFIII = 146.89, SFIV = 146.17, SFV = 148.30, SMII = 130.60. As SFV is
the highest value, the eel is assigned to stage FV.

stage,
but
remained silver eel. Transition probabilities from S to
E and Y were fixed to 0 while the one from S to S
was fixed to 1. These transitions were conditional on
survival probability (Φ) and stages were related to
observations through detection probabilities (P).
We defined a set of candidate models incorporating
biologically relevant combinations of time (represent-
ing temporal variation between sampling periods, i.e.
6 months), stages and group effects on survival, tran-
sition and detection probabilities. Regarding temporal
effects on survival, we considered continuous and
seasonal effects to test for the influence of weather.
We incorporated a group effect (Vacc1, Vacc2,
Grau1, Grau08, Grau09 or Grau10) to assess whether
the stage in which eels were stocked influenced their
survival. We examined the stage effect on survival as
it was suspected to differ between sexually undiffer-
entiated eels, yellow and silver eels. Regarding recap-
ture probabilities, we considered temporal effect and
because silver eels were supposed to be less seden-
tary than in other stages due to their need to migrate
downstream to the sea, we tested for an influence of
stage. We did not consider an effect of group on
recapture probability because sampling effort did not
vary (passive trapping).
We incorporated these effects on each parameter
(P, Φ and w) sequentially while constraints on
remaining parameters were held constant. Once the
main effect was determined for a parameter, we
added each of the remaining effects in an additive
and interactive fashion to assess if one of these com-
binations was relevant and we repeated this until no
better model was selected. We started by identifying
the most appropriate structure for P, then for Φ using
the previously selected structure for P and finally for
w using the structures for P and Φ selected in the
previous steps. In total, we fitted 68 models (See
Table S1 in Supporting Information) and selected the
most parsimonious model using AIC (Burnham &
Anderson 2002).
These analyses were performed with program
E-SURGE (Choquet et al. 2009a). In addition, we
assessed the quality of fit of multistate models
(Pradel et al. 2003) using program U-CARE (Cho-
quet et al. 2009b).
We estimated abundance Ni at sample occasion i, as
ni/^Pi, where ni is the number of eels recaptured and ^Pi
is the estimated detection at the occasion i. Approxi-
mate 95% confidence intervals were calculated as
N^i  2  SEðN^iÞ, where SEðN^iÞ ¼ niðSEð^PiÞ=^P2Þ. We
predicted the number of silver eels obtained by stock-
ing as follows. Eels become migrant silver eels
between 2 and 12 years in the Mediterranean region.
Hence, we focused on the number of silver eel
obtained between 2 and 12 years after stocking start-
ing with 100 sexually undifferentiated eels. The fate
of individual was determined based on repeated Ber-
noulli trials for survival and multinomial trials for
transition between states, using the stage-specific esti-
mates obtained from the best model. Our best sup-
ported model including time effect on both survival
and transition (see Results), we used the mean
survival and transition probabilities of each stage
for the simulations. Demographic stochasticity was
accounted for by repeating this process 1000 times.
These analyses were performed in program R (R
Development Core Team 2009).
Results
The goodness-of-fit test result stated that we could
not reject the null hypothesis that the model fits the
data adequately (v2 = 64.21, df = 59, P = 0.30).
Parameters were estimated on a 6-month interval
(interval between two samplings period).
The best model according to AIC (See Table S1)
suggested that recapture probabilities varied with
stages and time. Silver eels had a higher recapture
probability than other stages (Table 3) (except in
October 2009 and 2010).
Survival probabilities did not depend on group, but
differed according to stages. Time also influenced
survival probabilities of all eel stages (Fig. 1), with
marked fluctuations over the study period. In particu-
lar, survival of sexually undifferentiated eels was
lower during the spring/summer (April to October)
than in autumn/winter (from October to April) (z-test
(Lebreton et al. 1992), z = 5.09, P-value < 0.01).
This seasonal variation was not significant for the
survival of yellow eels (z = 0.30, P-value = 0.76).
In October 2010, survival of both sexually undiffer-
entiated eels and yellow eels was extremely low.
Because three of six probabilities were estimated
to 1, a boundary of the domain of a probability, it
was difficult to determine a trend in the survival of
silver eels. These boundary estimates are due to the
fact that all silver eels survived over the time interval,
which, as a consequence of no variation in the
survival outcome, makes it impossible to compute
standard errors.
Transitions between stages were influenced by
time, group and states (See Table S1 and Table S2 in
Supporting
information).
Transition
probabilities
from sexually undifferentiated eels to yellow eels
(females only) were higher than transition probabili-
ties from sexually undifferentiated eels to silver eels
(males only) whatever group and sampling period
(Fig. 2). Transition probabilities of eels stocked as
glass eels (groups Grau 08, Grau 09 and Grau 10)
were null during the next few months after stocking
(Fig. 2), but then increased with time. For individuals

stocked as sexually undifferentiated eels (groups
Vacc1 and Grau1), transition probabilities increased
first,
then
fluctuated
between
sampling
periods.
Indeed, transition probabilities were higher during
spring/summer (from April to October) than during
autumn/winter (from October to April). Finally, tran-
sition probabilities of bigger stocked individuals
(>300 mm) (group Vacc2, mostly composed of yel-
low eels) showed oscillations between seasons.
Population size was estimated for each eel stage
and for each sampling period from April 2008 to
May 2011. The number of sexually undifferentiated
eels was higher than the number of yellow eels,
which was higher than the number of silver eels
(Table 4). The number of sexually undifferentiated
eels oscillated with the season. Indeed, the number of
individuals was higher in spring than in the following
autumn.
The
number
of
yellow
eels
increased
constantly with time. However, the number of silver
eels decreased since October 2009.
Numbers of future genitors were predicted for
groups Vacc1, Vacc2 and Grau1. These groups were
chosen as representative because their individuals
were old enough when they were stocked for their
transition probabilities to have reached the oscillation
regime. We assumed this regime to be representative
of the trend in transition probabilities because it
reflects behavioural changes between seasons (see
Discussion). Mean cumulative number of silver eels
quickly reached a plateau starting between 3 and
5 years and after 12 years, between 10 and 14 silver
eels were obtained (Fig. 3).
Discussion
The analysis of stages’ dynamics provides a powerful
tool for evaluating stocking experiments by determin-
ing the demographic parameters of the stocked popu-
lation and predicting spawner production. We applied
this approach to the European eels which has, to our
knowledge, never been done before.
Recapture
Recapture probabilities were low and varied with
stages and time. Our estimates showed that silver eels
had, in general, a higher recapture probability than
sexually undifferentiated eels and yellow eels. This
might be explained by the fact that individuals were
captured using passive nets. As a consequence, the
more mobile an eel was, the more it was likely to be
recaptured. Because silver eels were trying to migrate
downstream to the ocean (Tesch 2003), they were
more prone to be recaptured in the fishing nets. The
very low recapture probabilities of yellow eels were
consistent with the fact that this stage is considered
as the most sedentary and territorial stage within the
whole eel lifecycle (Lafaille et al. 2005). As yellow
eels were stocked in October 2007, they could still
look for a territory in April 2008, which might
explain the higher recapture probability in this sam-
pling period. Recapture probabilities also varied

between sampling periods. Weather might be the
main cause of these fluctuations, drop in water tem-
perature reducing movements and therefore catches
(Riley et al. 2011) and rain and wind having positive
effect on recapture probabilities.
Survival
We did not detect any influence of group on survival
probability. This provided evidence that stage in
which eels were stocked did not influence their future
survival. Therefore, instead of only reserving glass
eels for restocking, older eels (e.g. yellow eels) cap-
tured could also be restocked to produce genitors fas-
ter. Indeed, yellow eels become silver eels faster than
glass eels that need more time to mature. However,
we found evidence that survival probabilities were
influenced by stages and time. Indeed, survival of
sexually undifferentiated eels was lower during the
spring/summer period (April to October) than in
autumn/winter (from October to April). This is coher-
ent with the fact that during the cold months of win-
ter, eels were immobile and did not feed (Panfili
et al. 1994). This long fast might make the spring/
summer period crucial for eels survival as individuals
had to build up their fat stores again during this
period.
In October 2010, both sexually undifferentiated
eels and yellow eels survival were extremely low.
This might be a consequence of a negative density-
dependence effect due to the stocking of 2.5 kg of
glass eels each year (Lobon-Cervia & Iglesias 2008;
Acou et al. 2011). To check this hypothesis, analyses
of the recapture data from the last sampling periods
should be performed.
We could not determine a trend in the survival of
silver eels because of half probabilities estimated on
the boundary.
Between-stage transitions
We first showed that probabilities of transition from
sexually undifferentiated eels to yellow eels (females)
were higher than probabilities of transition from sex-
ually undifferentiated eels to silver eels (males). This
indicated that most eels in Pisci-Sud were females.
This was expected as sex is mainly determined by eel
density, with low (resp. high) densities favouring
females (resp. males) development (Tesch 2003;

the
probabilities
increased during the first years after stocking without
being influencing by a season effect (Fig. 2). Then,
the probabilities fluctuated between sampling periods
as the transition probabilities for eels from Vacc2.
Indeed, transition probabilities were lower in autumn/
winter than in spring/summer. During winter, eels
were immobile and did not feed (Panfili et al. 1994).
Consequently, growth was slackened during these
periods and transition probabilities between stages
were lower or null (as the growth is directly linked
with the stage assigned to an eel (Table 2)). Two
hypotheses could explain the first increase in the
probabilities. First, eels might be more active when
they were young (whatever the stage they belong)
and kept feeding during autumn/winter. Thus, they
kept growing and their probabilities of transition
increased with time. However, once they reached
older ages, eels became more sedentary and were
influenced by the season. As we did not know the
age of eels, we could not confirm this hypothesis by
testing for an age effect. The second hypothesis is
that stocking could be a stress factor modifying the
behaviour of young eels (glass eels and sexually
undifferentiated eels) during the first months after
stocking.
Population size and predicted number of silver eels
Since the stocking experiment has started, the number
of eels in old stages has remained lower than the
number of eels in younger stages. First, this can be
explained by the fact that many eels have not reached
the older stages (yellow eels and silver eels) yet.
Secondly, because sexually undifferentiated eels and

Eels stocking experiment and demography

yellow eels do not all survive, most eels will never
reach the silver eel state.
The number of sexually undifferentiated eels esti-
mated in Pisci-Sud was higher in early spring than in
the following autumn. This is consistent with the fact
that the survival of sexually undifferentiated eels was
lower during spring/summer than during winter.
Unlike sexually undifferentiated eels, the number of
yellow eels constantly increased with time. This
might be explained by high transition probabilities
from sexually undifferentiated eels to yellow eels
(Fig. 2).
However,
the
number
of
silver
eels
decreased since October 2009. This was because
most of the individuals from the first groups of eels
stocked in Pisci-Sud (Vacc1, Vacc2 and Grau1) have
already reached the silver eel stage, whereas eels
from more recent groups (Grau 08, Grau 09 and Grau
10) have not yet.
Regarding predictions, from 100 sexually undiffer-
entiated eels initially stocked, between 10 and 14 sil-
vers eels were obtained between 3 and 5 years after
stocking. This is consistent with a previous study
(Acou et al. 2003) that found that silver eels produc-
tion in the Mediterranean region is fast (from 3 to
6 years) compared with the north European environ-
ment (Sved€ang et al. 1996). Further work is required
to estimate the number of silver eels obtained from
eels stocked as glass eels (groups Grau08, Grau09
and Grau10). We anticipate that stocking projects in
the Southern Europe may be more effective in
increasing the number of genitors.
In conclusion, we estimated demographic parame-
ters of a stocked population of eels using multistate
capture–recapture modelling. These estimates allowed
predicting numbers of future genitors. We encourage
further studies (determination of lipids and pollutants
concentration and evaluation of the parasite load) to
assess the quality of these genitors.
