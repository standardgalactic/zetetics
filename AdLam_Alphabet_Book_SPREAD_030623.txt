THE
OF FULFULDE

Today, the ADLaM alphabet is used by over 4 million people in
West Africa and around the world. But that wasn’t always the case…
ADLaM began as a childhood dream of two young brothers 
from Guinea. Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry grew up speaking 
Pulaar (the native tongue of the Fula people) but not writing it. 
For centuries it was a spoken language with no alphabet.
The Barry brothers dedicated their lives to changing that.
They created letters, systems, typographies and eventually literacy 
programs where their alphabet could be taught and learned.
This book is a book designed to be just one more step in realizing
their life-long dream of bringing literacy to the Fulani people through 
the alphabet they spent their entire lives making.
