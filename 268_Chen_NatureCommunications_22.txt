Precise, scalable, and sustainable control of genetic and cellular activities in
mammalian cells is key to developing precision therapeutics and smart bio-
manufacturing. Here we create a highly tunable, modular, versatile CRISPR-
based synthetic transcription system for the programmable control of gene
expression and cellular phenotypes in mammalian cells. Genetic circuits con-
sisting of well-characterized libraries of guide RNAs, binding motifs of syn-
thetic operators, transcriptional activators, and additional genetic regulatory
elements express mammalian genes in a highly predictable and tunable
manner. We demonstrate the programmable control of reporter genes epi-
somally and chromosomally, with up to 25-fold more activity than seen with
the EF1α promoter, in multiple cell types. We use these circuits to program the
secretion of human monoclonal antibodies and to control T-cell effector
function marked by interferon-γ production. Antibody titers and interferon-γ
concentrations signiﬁcantly correlate with synthetic promoter strengths,
providing a platform for programming gene expression and cellular function
in diverse applications.
The regulation of gene expression in complex organisms has been a
central focus for characterizing disease variation1, producing mono-
clonal antibodies (mAbs)2, developing gene and cell therapies3, and
investigating other biological phenomena4. Synthetic biology offers
powerful ways to harness artiﬁcial gene regulatory tools in mammalian
systems5–9. For example, tumor-speciﬁc synthetic gene circuits applied
to cancer immunotherapy yield signiﬁcant anti-tumor responses in
mice10. However, the use of strong constitutive promoters in gene
expression platforms can increase the expression of target genes to
the point of causing unwanted, dose-dependent side effects, raising
safety concerns11. For instance, the use of the cytomegalovirus pro-
moter (CMVp) to express a tumor-killing gene markedly increases
apoptosis in normal cells and induces acute systemic toxicity in vivo12.
Although promoter substitution is a simple and commonly imple-
mented strategy for altering gene expression13, optimizing cell type-
speciﬁc or gene-speciﬁc natural promoters demands extensive effort14.
Thus, controlling target gene expression with natural promoters has
had only limited success in achieving desired biological phenotypes or
therapeutic outcomes.
Another approach to regulating gene expression is to engineer
transcription factors (TFs) and transcriptional activation domains
(TADs) to control transcriptional activities15. Artiﬁcial transcription
factors (aTFs), which can be rationally designed in silico, have been
derived from zinc ﬁngers (ZFs)16, transcription activator-like effectors
(TALEs)17, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats associated protein (CRISPR-Cas)18,19. By conjugating DNA-
binding proteins with various TADs, such as VP1620, VP6421, and
VPR (VP64-p65-RTA)22, researchers have demonstrated the utility of
tuning promoter activity with aTFs. Particularly, CRISPR-based aTFs
(crisprTFs) are simpler to customize and target to genomic loci of

interest, using guide RNA (gRNA) with homology, than complex ZFs
and TALEs; thus, crisprTFs are rapidly gaining popularity in biomedical
research23. For example, several types of crisprTFs and compound
activation mediators, based on deactivated CRISPR-associated protein
9 (dCas9), have been widely used in mammalian cells, such as dCas9-
VP6424, dCas9-VPR, SunTag25, and synergistic activation mediator
(SAM)26. dCas9-VPR, SunTag, and SAM can strongly activate genes in
multiple species27. Our group has also developed crisprTFs to regulate
gene expression driven by natural or artiﬁcial eukaryotic promoters28.
Here, we build upon these aTF platforms by creating a compre-
hensive crisprTF promoter system for the programmable regulation of
gene expression in mammalian cells. Our goal is to engineer a universal
platform for tunable, scalable, and consistent transcriptional control in
a wide variety of contexts, applicable to various cell types or target
genes. Speciﬁcally, through mimicking natural mammalian promoters,
we have created modular libraries of both crisprTFs and synthetic
operators by: (1) altering gRNA sequences; (2) adjusting the number of
gRNA binding sites (BS) in the synthetic operator; (3) incorporating
additional control elements in the operator or crisprTF to augment
expression; and (4) designing multiple orthogonal crisprTFs. Because
it implements a multi-tier gene circuit assembly design, this system has
the advantage of operating at both epigenomic and genomic levels
with precise tunability, versatile modularity, and high scalability.
To demonstrate the utility of this synthetic transcription platform,
we ﬁrst validated the precise control of two ﬂuorescent reporter genes
and then programmed the production of recombinant human mAbs,
including a functional checkpoint antibody, anti-human programmed
cell death protein 1 (anti-hPD1)29. High-yield, stable production was
achieved by using crisprTF promoters within a recombinase-mediated,
multi-landing pad (multi-LP) DNA integration platform30. Multi-LP DNA
integration in genomic safe harbor loci (e.g., the Rosa26 locus) enables
predictable single-copy integration, limited transgene silencing, stable
gene expression, and consistent long-term protein production30–32.
Anti-hPD1 gene circuits expressed chromosomally with this system
modulated certain anti-tumor phenotypes of human T cells. These
results indicate that highly tunable, sustainable, and predictable pro-
tein expression over a wide dynamic range can be achieved with our
scalable, modular synthetic transcription system.
Results
Construction of a programmable, modular synthetic
transcription system with crisprTFs
To enable high tunability and versatility of the synthetic transcription
system for a wide spectrum of applications, we adopted a 3-tiered
modular library design33. The Tier 1 entry vector library encodes a
variety of interchangeable gene regulatory parts and effector genes,
including crisprTFs, gRNAs, operators, and other components (Fig. 1a).
Tier 1 parts can be assembled into the Tier 2 expression vector library
for transient expression, followed by modular assembly into the Tier 3
integration gene circuit library (Fig. 1a). We built a library of guide
RNAs (gRNAs) that were orthogonal to the CHO genome and ﬁrst
selected eight of the scored ones for evaluation (Fig. 1b). For each
gRNA, we designed a corresponding operator containing 8× com-
plementary gRNA BS to drive the expression of a far-red ﬂuorescent
reporter gene, mKate, and evaluated their performance episomally
(Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Flow cytometry results showed a
wide range of mKate expression levels among different gRNAs
(Fig. 1d). As active natural mammalian promoter sequences typically
have a high GC content (57%)34, we reasoned that the GC content of the
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-proximal seed region (8–12 bases at
the 3′-end of a gRNA and its BS sequence) plays a role in regulating
gene expression. gRNAs with a GC content of ~50–60% in seed
sequences appeared to express mKate at higher levels than gRNAs with
a lower or higher GC content (Fig. 1b, d). Therefore, we selected a
relatively weak gRNA (gRNA9) with a high GC content (≥70%) and
introduced mutations in two consecutive bases within the seed
sequence to alter its GC content. The resulting gRNA10 and its
matching operator, with ≥50% GC and still orthogonal to the CHO
genome, yielded much higher mKate expression than its ancestor,
gRNA9 (Fig. 1d, p = 0.0004; one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison). The CMV control and gRNA1, 2, 6, 7,
and 10 had higher expression (Fig. 1d, all p ≤0.0005), while only
gRNA4 had lower expression, than the EF1α control (Fig. 1d, p < 0.05).
The expression obtained with gRNA1, 2, and 10 was not signiﬁcantly
different from that obtained with the CMV control (all p > 0.05).
Overall, the top four gRNAs, with more than twofold higher expression
than EF1α, had 50–60% GC in the ﬁrst 8–10 bases of the seed sequences
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We selected three representative gRNAs that
yielded weak (gRNA4), medium (gRNA7), and strong expression
(gRNA10) to investigate further. A comparison of three crisprTFs
(dCas9-VP16, dCas9-VP64, dCas9-VPR) showed that dCas9-VPR yielded
a markedly higher expression level than dCas9-VP16 or dCas9-VP64
(Supplementary Fig. 3, both p < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Dun-
nett’s Multiple Comparison), consistent with a previous report27. Thus,
to enable the largest dynamic expression range possible, we selected
dCas9-VPR for subsequent investigation.
Transcriptional programming in multiple mammalian cell types
To control gene expression at distinct levels, we built a library of
synthetic operators containing 2×–16× gRNA BS for gRNA4, 7, and 10
(Fig. 1c). Transient expression of mKate was assessed in CHO cells at
48 hours post-transfection (Supplementary Fig. 4). Flow cytometry
data showed dramatically different patterns of mKate expression
among the three gRNA series (Fig. 2a). Comparison of each gRNA
series with expression levels observed with the EF1α promoter control
showed: reporter activities for the gRNA4 series that ranged from 15%
(2× BS) to 270% (16× BS), with 2×–8× BS driving notably lower, and 16×
BS driving signiﬁcantly higher, expression; reporter activities for the
gRNA7 series that ranged from 26% (2× BS) to 760% (16× BS), with
2×–4× BS driving notably lower, and 8×–16× BS driving signiﬁcantly
higher, expression; and reporter activities for the gRNA10 series that
ranged from 30% (2× BS) to 1107% (16× BS), with 6×–16× BS having
signiﬁcantly higher expression (Fig. 2a). Signiﬁcant correlations
between expression levels and the number of BS were found with all
three gRNA series (Supplementary Fig. 5a, all p < 0.05; Pearson corre-
lation analysis). Overall, with differences in gRNA sequences and the
number of complementary gRNA BS in the operators, we achieved a
wide dynamic range of ~74-fold change in the intensity of the reporter
signals with these gRNA series in CHO cells. Gene expression was
proportionate to the number of BS, indicating consistent tunability.
To translate these results into other mammalian cell types
(mouse, rat, and human), we selected the gRNA10 series because it had
the lowest leakage and the highest expression among the three com-
prehensively tested gRNAs. Interestingly, we observed dramatic dif-
ferences in mKate expression with the CMV control in mouse C2C12
myoblasts (Fig. 2b), human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells
(Fig. 2c), rat H9c2 cardiac myoblasts (Fig. 2d), and human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Fig. 2e). The gRNA10 series behaved in
a similar order in these cells as it did in CHO cells. In C2C12 myoblasts,
mKate expression ranged from 11% (2× BS) to 316% (16× BS) of EF1α,
with 2×–6× BS being notably lower and 8×–16× BS being signiﬁcantly
higher than that observed with EF1α (Fig. 2b). In HEK cells, mKate
expression ranged from 60% (2× BS) to 1026% (16× BS) of EF1α, with
6×–16× BS being signiﬁcantly stronger than EF1α (Fig. 2c). In rat H9c2
cells, mKate expression ranged from 27% (2× BS) to 688% (16× BS) of
EF1α, with 6×–16× BS being signiﬁcantly stronger than EF1α (Fig. 2d). In
hiPSC cells, mKate expression ranged from 80% (2× BS) to 950% (16×
BS) of EF1α, with 8×–16× BS being signiﬁcantly stronger than EF1α
(Fig. 2e). Similarly, expression levels and the number of BS markedly
correlated in all four rodent and human cell types tested with the

gRNA10 series (Supplementary Fig. 5b–e, all p < 0.001; Pearson cor-
relation analyses). Collectively, with the gRNA10 series alone, we
achieved up to ~29-fold and 17-fold changes in mKate expression in
rodent and human cells, respectively.
To compare the programmable functionality of our crisprTF-
based transcription platform to another orthogonal synthetic TF-
based system, we constructed a Gal4-VPR-based platform containing
2×–8× UAS-BS with the same architecture (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
Although the Gal4-VPR/UAS system achieved mKate expression ran-
ging from 11% (2× UAS-BS) to 745% (4× UAS-BS) of crisprTF 8× gRNA10-
BS in CHO-K1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6b), we observed no correla-
tion between gene expression levels and the number of UAS-BS in the

Fig. 1 | Design and development of the crisprTF promoter system. a Schematic
illustration of the programmable and modular design of the crisprTF-based
transcription system. To increase its programmability, this platform was mod-
ularly divided into three tiers of libraries constructed with the Gateway-Gibson
cloning approach. The Tier 1 library was composed of entry vector modules
separately encoding gRNAs, synthetic operators with gRNA binding sites (BS)
upstream of a minimal promoter, effector genes, crisprTFs and their associated
promoters, and other transcriptional control elements. Tier 1 library units were
assembled into positional expression vectors with pre-deﬁned orders by Gate-
way cloning, forming the Tier 2 library. Positional assembly by Gibson cloning
was performed to connect independent transcriptional units (TUs), derived
from positional expression vectors in the Tier 2 library by I-SceI restriction
digestion, into complete gene circuits. The Tier 3 library comprised integration
circuits enabling precision control of the target gene(s) when integrated into a
landing pad (i.e., a designated chromosomal safe harbor) with BxB1 integrase-
mediated, site-speciﬁc chromosomal integration. b Ten gRNAs (gRNA1-10)
orthogonal to the CHO genome were screened for expression. gRNA10 was
modiﬁed from gRNA9 with GG-to-AA mutations to reduce the GC content of the
seed and the entire sequences. c To evaluate episomal gene expression levels,
CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with four plasmids: plasmid #1 (P1)
constitutively expressing gRNA; plasmid #2 (P2) encoding the synthetic
operator with some number (x) of gRNA BS to drive mKate expression; plasmid
#3 (P3) constitutively expressing a crisprTF; and plasmid #4 (P4) constitutively
expressing the transfection marker (EBFP). mKate signals were assessed at
48 hours post-transfection. d For the gRNA screening, each gRNA was paired
with a matching synthetic operator containing 8× gRNA BS to control mKate
expression. EF1α and CMV promoters driving mKate expression served as
positive controls. Experimental groups (+), represented by red solid bars, were
transfected with four plasmids (P1–P4). Control groups (−), represented by red
hollow bars, to detect baseline operator leakage were transfected without P1
(P2–P4). Data were normalized to the EF1α control and are presented as relative
median mKate intensity (%). gRNA1 and gRNA2 operators exhibited notable
leakage without gRNA, suggesting non-speciﬁc transcriptional activities that
were not associated with targeted crisprTF binding (CMV, gRNA1, gRNA2,

Fig. 2 | Gene expression programmed by the number of gRNA BS in synthetic
operators. A library of gRNA4, 7, and 10 synthetic operators containing 2×–16×
gRNA BS was built to assess the number of gRNA BS that would be effective as a

groups (+), represented by red solid bars, were transiently transfected with four
plasmids (P1–P4 in Fig. 1c) whereas gRNA-free control groups (−), represented by

transfection with ﬂow cytometry. a Synthetic operators of the gRNA4, 7, and

lysis). Altogether, these results underscore the predictability and
tunability of our crisprTF-based system in mammalian cells.
Incorporation of additional genetic control elements to enhance
gene expression
To extend tunability over a greater range, we incorporated the fol-
lowing additional genetic control elements in the crisprTF-based sys-
tem: (i) a strong synthetic transcriptional activator-SAM; (ii) dual gRNA
transcriptional units (TUs) to increase gRNA expression; (iii) an addi-
tional 2× nuclear localizing sequence (NLS) at the 5′-end of the dCas9-
VPR gene; and (iv) a synthetic intron (SI) to enhance gene expression35
(Fig. 3). Transient mKate expression in CHO-K1 cells was assessed at
48 hours post-transfection. The combination of SAM, dCas9-VPR, and
the gRNA10 8× BS operator resulted in a 48% increase in gene
expression (p = 0.0003); however, gene expression decreased by 12.3%
when SAM was combined with dCas9-VPR and the 16× BS operator
(p = 0.0023), suggesting a limitation of gene activation by conjoining
various TADs (Fig. 3a; two-tailed paired Student’s t test). With the
addition of an extra gRNA10 TU to boost the amount of gRNA, we
observed
modest
increases,
of
18.7%
(p = 0.0278)
and
17.5%
(p = 0.009), with gRNA10 8× and 16× BS operators, respectively
(Fig. 3b; two-tailed paired Student’s t test). Thus, a single gRNA TU may
be sufﬁcient for many applications. With an additional 2× NLS incor-
porated at the 5′-end of dCas9-VPR, mKate expression increased by
64.0% (p = 0.0055) and 33.0% (p = 0.0034) with gRNA10 8× and 16× BS
operators, respectively, suggesting that the nuclear localization of the
original dCas9-VPR may be slightly insufﬁcient to gain maximum

activation of gene expression (Fig. 3c; two-tailed paired Student’s
t test).
On the other hand, the addition of SI at the 5′ untranslated region
(UTR) of the target gene led to an ~200–300% elevation in mKate
signals with nearly all operators in all three gRNA series when com-
pared with their original counterparts, even with the strongest
operator (i.e., 16× BS of gRNA10; Supplementary Fig. 7). The gRNA4-SI
series yielded expression levels that ranged from 70% (4× BS + SI) to
528% (16× BS + SI) of those observed with the EF1α promoter, with
8×–16× BS + SI being notably higher than the EF1α control; the gRNA7-
SI series ranged from 65% (4× BS + SI) to 532% (16× BS + SI)of EF1α, with
8×–16× BS + SI being signiﬁcantly higher than the EF1α control; the
gRNA10-SI series ranged from 205% (4× BS + SI) to 2463% (16× BS + SI)
of EF1α, with 8×–16× BS + SI showing signiﬁcantly higher expression
than that observed with the EF1α promoter (Fig. 3d). We did not
observe any substantial increases of ﬂuorescent signals in the absence
of gRNA in any of the SI constructs (Fig. 3d). These results indicated
that SI can be fully compatible with synthetic crisprTF promoter-based
gene regulation and is an efﬁcient control element to increase gene
expression. Notable correlations were found between expression
levels and the number of BS with the gRNA4-SI and gRNA10-SI series
(Supplementary Fig. 8, both p < 0.05; Pearson correlation analysis).
Taken together, by adding SI to the original gRNA operators, we
expanded the achievable dynamic expression range in CHO cells to an
~167-fold change, offering analog precision control of gene expression
with a near-continuous spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Precision control of gene expression via genomic integration
We designed our crisprTF promoter platform to be fully compatible
with our multi-LP DNA integration platform30 for the stable expression
of large gene circuits in engineered mammalian cells. We built gene
circuits that contained insulated TUs encoding different gRNAs, gRNA
operator-target gene pairs, and a crisprTF gene, together with an
integration-enabled circuit selection marker gene, puromycin (Fig. 4a).
Chromosomal integration of a single DNA copy of the gene circuit was
mediated by BxB1 integrase into a single-LP (sLP) locus in engineered
adherent CHO cells (Fig. 4a). After selection with puromycin for inte-
gration in engineered sLP-CHO cells, indicated by the disappearance of
the EYFP signal, we analyzed target gene expression by ﬂow cytometry.
Both the gRNA4 and gRNA10 series exhibited tunable control of
expression proﬁles in sLP-CHO cells, similar to that seen with their
episomal counterparts (Fig. 4b). Gene expression of the gRNA4 series
ranged from 7% (2× BS) to 56% (16× BS) of that observed with the
integrated EF1α control, with 2×–6× BS exhibiting markedly lower
expression than with EF1α; the gRNA10 series ranged from 13% (2× BS)
to 207% (16× BS) of EF1α, with 2×–4× BS also exhibiting signiﬁcantly
lower expression than with EF1α. Adding SI at the 5′ UTR resulted in
200–250% increases in target gene expression with representative
integration circuits (Fig. 4b, right side of the panel). With a single gen-
omically integrated copy, only gRNA10 16× BS without SI (207%) and 8×
and 16× BS with SI (223% and 521%, respectively) exhibited signiﬁcantly
stronger expression than seen with the integrated EF1α control (Fig. 4b).
Similar to what was observed with their episomal counterparts, when
both the gRNA4 and gRNA10 series were chromosomally integrated
into sLP, the correlations between the number of BS in the synthetic
operator and gene expression levels were highly signiﬁcant (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10a, both p < 0.005; Pearson correlation analysis).
To provide evidence that our crisprTF-based transcription system
directly programs gene transcription, we measured the transcription
levels of mKate in chromosomally integrated CHO cells. In line with
mKate expression determined by ﬂow cytometry, gene transcription
of the gRNA10 series ranged from 5.7% (2× BS) to 833% (16× BS with SI)
of EF1α (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Intriguingly, with the addition of the
SI, the transcription of mKate increased 6.9 folds (8× BS) and 4.3 folds
(16× BS), indicating that the SI may be able to upregulate gene
transcription. The correlation between the number of BS and gene
transcription levels was markedly signiﬁcant (Supplementary Fig. 10c,
p = 0.0002; Pearson correlation analysis).
To demonstrate that crisprTF circuit integration functions in
human cells, we engineered an sLP in HEK293 cells and performed
BxB1-mediated chromosomal integration with the gRNA10 series
(Supplementary Fig. 11a). In sLP-HEK293 cells, gene expression of the
gRNA10 series ranged from 17% (2× BS) to 401% (16× BS) of EF1α
(Supplementary Fig. 11b), similar to what we recorded in sLP-CHO cells.
The number of BS correlated strongly with gene expression levels in
sLP-HEK293 cells integrated with the gRNA10 series (Supplementary
Fig. 11c, p = 0.0007; Pearson correlation analysis).
Nonetheless, by observing the expression proﬁles of puromycin-
selected pools of crisprTF circuit integrants in sLP-CHO cells, we found
that after 4 weeks of culturing, all four circuits from both the gRNA4
and gRNA10 series had notably decreased expression levels, suggest-
ing the instability of gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 10d, all
p < 0.01 at 4 weeks post selection; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
Multiple Comparison). To sustain long-term expression proﬁles, we
incorporated an additional 3′ ﬂanking selection marker, blasticidin,
into dCas9-VPR, linked by a 2A self-cleavage peptide (Fig. 4c)36. Flow
cytometry results demonstrated gene expression levels that were
similar or even slightly higher with most integration circuits immedi-
ately after one-time dual selection, compared with their unmodiﬁed
counterparts (Fig. 4d). Unlike what was observed with the CMV control
(Fig. 4e, p < 0.0001 at 2 and 4 weeks; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
Multiple
Comparison),
observations
over
four
weeks
revealed
improved stability in expression levels, with no marked change for any
of the four circuits examined (Fig. 4e, all p > 0.05 at 2 and 4 weeks).
Collectively, these data suggest that a ﬂanking selection marker
gene co-expressed with the dCas9-VPR gene may stabilize the crisprTF
circuit post-integration in sLP-CHO cells.
Modulation of human monoclonal antibody production
The controllable production of mAbs is desirable for many biomedical
applications. To determine whether our transcriptional platform could
be used for the precise control of antibody synthesis, we built inte-
gration gene circuits expressing a human mAb, JUG444, with the
immunoglobulin kappa light chain (LC) and immunoglobulin gamma
heavy chain (HC) genes separately expressed by the same gRNA10
operator as independent TUs (Fig. 5a). To avoid the potential
instability of dCas9-VPR expression under the control of CMVp during
long-term culture, we used adherent double LP (dLP)-CHO cells,
engineered with two distinct wild-type LPs: dLP1-1 and dLP1-2, to
accommodate an additional copy of the dCas9-VPR gene (Fig. 5a)31,37.
We ﬁrst performed a targeted integration into dLP1-1 alone in dLP-CHO
cells with a DNA payload encoding dCas9-VPR (Fig. 5a). Cells
were selected with three antibiotics and then subjected to single-cell
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate EYFP−/EBFP+
clones with the stably integrated dLP1-1 site and the free dLP1-2 site.
The functionality of clonally expanded cells was examined by
integrating individual gRNA10 control circuits that co-expressed
mKate and a monomeric blue ﬂuorescent reporter, TagBFP, as well
as another copy of the dCas9-VPR gene, as independent TUs into the
dLP1-2 site (Fig. 5a). Dually integrated cells were selected with four
antibiotics and then FACS-sorted into pools to expand them and
evaluate reporter expression (Fig. 5a). We found that mKate and
TagBFP driven by the same gRNA10 operators were simultaneously
expressed at similar levels in two distinct conﬁgurations (8× BS with-
out SI and 16× BS with SI), suggesting uniform transcriptional activa-
tion of both reporter TUs by two separate copies of the dCas9-VPR
gene (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 12a). Next, we replaced the
control circuit in the dLP1-2 site with individual gRNA10 mAb circuits
that differentially express JUG444 (Fig. 5a). Similarly, cells with mAb
circuits were selected and FACS-sorted into pools.

To examine the precision regulation and long-term stability of
mAb production, we maintained cultures of sorted cell pools over
ﬁve weeks and measured mAb concentration weekly, without con-
stant antibiotic selection. We recorded differential JUG444 pro-
duction in Week 1, driven by four distinct conﬁgurations: 8× or 16×
BS, with or without SI (JUGAb1-4, Fig. 5c). Stable mAb production
from a single mAb gene copy was sustained throughout the
experimental duration with all four conﬁgurations (Fig. 5c). Strik-
ingly, mAb production levels signiﬁcantly correlated with the
gRNA10 operator strengths documented in Fig. 4d (Fig. 5d, p < 0.05
at all time points; Pearson correlation analysis). The strongest
operator (16× BS with SI) yielded the highest mAb level, which was
comparable to the level previously observed with the strong con-
stitutive CMVp expressing two mAb gene copies30. The doubling
time of JUGAb3 (16× BS) and JUGAb4 (16× BS with SI) increased to 22
and 34 hours, respectively, suggesting the inﬂuence of increased
antibody production on cell growth in engineered dLP-CHO cells
(Fig. 5e). Overall, these data indicated that tunable and lasting
control can be applied to express human antibodies and potentially
other therapeutic proteins.

Programmable control of the human T-cell immune response
against tumor cells
To explore the applications of our platform for cellular therapy, we built
gRNA10 integration circuits with various conﬁgurations to program the
secretion of anti-hPD1, an important immune checkpoint inhibitor
widely used as a therapy in immuno-oncology29. The light chain and
heavy chain of anti-hPD1 were separately expressed by the same
gRNA10 operators as independent TUs (Fig. 6a). Similar to the JUG444
production, a copy of dCas9-VPR was pre-integrated into the dLP1-1 site
of the dLP-CHO cells to avoid its complete silencing. Each of the four
circuits, designed to differentially express anti-hPD1 (8× or 16× BS, with
or without SI), was then integrated into the dLP1-2 site of the dLP-CHO
cells, which had been selected and clonally sorted for dLP1-1 occupancy
(PD1Ab1-4, Fig. 6b). Dually integrated cells were selected and then sor-
ted into pools with FACS for expansion. Quantiﬁcation of anti-hPD1
secretion by sorted cells showed that the PD1Ab4 group (16× BS with SI)
had a signiﬁcantly higher titer of anti-hPD1 than all the other groups
(Fig. 6b, all p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA mixed-effects analysis with
Tukey’s multiple comparisons) and that the PD1Ab3 group (16× BS
without SI) had a notably higher titer than the PD1Ab1 group (8× BS
without SI) (Fig. 6b, p < 0.05). A strong correlation was found between
anti-hPD1 titers and crisprTF promoter strengths (Fig. 6c, p < 0.005;
Pearson correlation analysis).
To demonstrate the functionality of actively secreted anti-hPD1,
we developed a three-way CHO-tumor-human T-cell co-culture system
(Fig. 6d). We hypothesized that differentially programmed anti-hPD1
secretion would enhance T-cell effector function by correspondingly
blocking the interactions between tumor cells and T cells, mediated by
the engagement of PD1 with programmed death ligands. Sorted, dually
integrated dLP-CHO cells with individual conﬁgurations expressing
anti-hPD1 were ﬁrst seeded. Pre-activated human T cells and ovarian
cancer cells expressing a surface-displayed T-cell engager were then
added to the attached dLP-CHO cells10. IFN-γ production by T cells was
measured at 24 hours post-co-culture as a marker of T-cell activation
(Fig. 6d). T cells in the PD1Ab3 and PD1Ab4 groups produced sig-
niﬁcantly more IFN-γ than the control group (Fig. 6e, p < 0.05 and
p < 0.01, respectively; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s Multiple Com-
parison), corresponding to the higher titers of anti-hPD1 secretion. IFN-
γ production also notably correlated with anti-hPD1 titers in dLP-CHO
cell cultures prior to the start of co-culturing (Supplementary Fig. 12b,
p < 0.05; Pearson correlation analysis). Thus, this transcription system
can be used to produce functional proteins of clinical interest and
perturb cellular phenotypes in a highly regulated and precise manner.
Discussion
We have built and characterized a crisprTF promoter system for the
programmable regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells. This
system functions consistently across multiple mammalian cell types
and is, therefore, sufﬁciently versatile to be used in a variety of cellular
models for biomedicine and biomanufacturing.
To demonstrate the generalizability of the system’s gene reg-
ulatory activity, we used both episomal vectors in transiently trans-
fected
cells
and
site-speciﬁc,
stably
integrated
chromosomal
constructs in LP-engineered cells. We modulated three key para-
meters: (1) the gRNA sequence; (2) the number of gRNA BS repeats
in the operator; and 3) the CRISPR-based transcriptional activator
(different crisprTFs, different selection markers in the crisprTF, or an
additional copy of the crisprTF in LP-engineered cells). We also
incorporated genetic elements to enhance gene expression, including
SAM, an extra gRNA TU, extra NLS, and SI. Systematic characterization
of these constructs resulted in >1000-fold range of gene expression
levels. The strongest of our synthetic promoters, composed of 16×
gRNA BS repeats, was signiﬁcantly stronger than CMVp, one of the
strongest constitutive promoters currently used for mammalian
applications13. Recent systematic investigation of mismatched single
gRNAs (sgRNAs) has revealed sgRNA-DNA interaction rules controlling
endogenous gene expression and correlated phenotype38. In agree-
ment with previous ﬁndings, our introduction of a 2-bp mutation that
moderately altered the GC ratio in the PAM-proximal seed region of
gRNA10 and its BS markedly changed its gene expression proﬁles,
suggesting the importance of the gRNA seed sequence in controlling
our crisprTF promoter-driven transcriptional activities. We anticipate
that additional large-scale experimental screening, combined with
computational modeling or machine learning, could be used to pro-
gram gene expression even more precisely.
Various mechanisms of controlling gene expression at the tran-
scriptional level in eukaryotes have been identiﬁed39,40. Core pro-
moters and neighboring genetic elements play instrumental roles in
consolidating complex cascades of signaling events involved in tran-
scription, impacting gene expression39. The complexity of combina-
torial interactions among constituent TF regulatory elements hinders
the creation of synthetic mammalian promoters using natural motifs.
Although this issue has been gradually resolved in silico, it remains
challenging to overcome the context- or species-dependency for the
de novo design of mammalian promoters40. Positive transcriptional
elements have been found between −350 and −40 bp relative to the
transcription start sites (TSS) in many of the tested human promoters,
whereas negative regulatory elements are more likely to be located
−350 to −1000 bp upstream of the TSS34. Therefore, we positioned our
synthetic operators at up to roughly −400 bp upstream of the TSS. Our
data are consistent with previous reports suggesting that longer
transcriptional bursts and thus higher expression levels might be
achieved with synthetic transcriptional activators by arraying multiple
BS upstream of a given promoter28,41. The results of our episomal tests
with all three gRNA series established strong linear correlations
between gene expression levels and the number of BS (up to 16×) in the
operators in multiple mammalian species and cell types (Supplemen-
tary Figs. 5 and 8). We found similar signiﬁcant correlations with two
gRNA series when they were genomically integrated in LP-engineered
cells (Supplementary Figs. 10a and 11c).

Fig. 5 | Precision control of human monoclonal antibody (mAb) production.
a Schematic illustrations of the sequential, site-speciﬁc genomic integration of two
payload gene circuits into the CHO cells engineered with a double landing pad
(dLP) for human mAb production. First, a synthetic gene circuit encoding one copy
of dCas9-VPR gene and 2 ﬂanking mammalian selection marker genes, hygromycin
(5′-end) and G418 (3′-end), was integrated into dLP1-1 site with BxB1 integrase.
Selected cells with single dLP1-1 occupancy were clonally sorted based on EYFP
−/EBFP+ signals. A single clone with the most consistent outputs of dCas9-VPR and
EBFP was chosen for the second BxB1-mediated integration targeting the free dLP1-
2 site. The second integration gene circuit contained independent TUs encoding
either mKate and TagBFP reporter genes (control circuit) or the light chain and
heavy chain genes of a human mAb JUG444 (mAb circuit) as well as gRNA10, one
copy of dCas9-VPR gene, and two additional ﬂanking selection marker genes: pur-
omycin (5′-end) and blasticidin (3′-end). Integrated cells selected with four anti-

Besides
tuning
transcriptional
activities
by
altering
gRNA
sequences and operator strengths, we discovered several compatible
genetic control elements that synergistically augment gene expression.
When combined with dCas9-VPR, SAM moderately increased expres-
sion at medium, but not high, levels episomally. We examined the
compatibility of SAM with dCas9-VPR when genomically integrated, by
assembling large gRNA10 circuits that contained independent TUs
encoding both systems (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Surprisingly, the VPR-
SAM hybrid system at medium expression level generated no further
increase in gene expression; in fact, at high expression level, VPR-SAM
actually decreased expression (Supplementary Fig. 13b). This see-
mingly paradoxical result suggested possible competition for tran-
scriptional resources among components within the hybrid system, for
example, overlapping TADs encoded in SAM and dCas9-VPR genes,
including VP64 and p6542,43. It remains to be tested whether alternative
CRISPR-based gene activation strategies, such as the CRISPR-assisted
trans enhancer, would be compatible for combinatorial use with our
system for auxiliary augmentation of transcription44.

Fig. 6 | Programmable control of anti-hPD1 secretion and the human T-cell anti-
tumor response. a Schematic illustration of engineering the anti-hPD1-secreting
dLP-CHO cells with sequential and site-speciﬁc integration of two payload gene
circuits with BxB1 integrase. Clonally sorted EYFP−/EBFP+ dLP-CHO cells stably
integrated with a gene circuit encoding one copy of dCas9-VPR gene and ﬂanking
selection marker genes in the dLP1-1 site were used for the second BxB1-mediated
integration. The free dLP1-2 site was integrated with a gene circuit containing
independent TUs that encoded: the 5′ ﬂanking puromycin gene, gRNA10, the light
chain and heavy chain genes of anti-hPD1 driven by the same gRNA10 operators,
one copy of dCas9-VPR gene, and the 3′ ﬂanking blasticidin gene linked to dCas9-
VPR gene by a 2A self-cleavage peptide sequence. Dually integrated cells were
selected with four antibiotics and then subjected to pooled cell sorting based on
EYFP−/EBFP−signals. b Octet mAb titer quantitation showed differential anti-hPD1
secretion programmed by four distinct conﬁgurations of gRNA10 operators:
PD1Ab1 (8× BS), PD1Ab2 (8× BS with SI), PD1Ab3 (16× BS), and PD1Ab4 (16× BS with
SI) (one-way ANOVA mixed-effects analysis with multiple comparisons corrected by
Tukey test; PD1Ab3 and PD1Ab4 vs. PD1Ab1: p = 0.0160 and p < 0.0001, respec-
tively; PD1Ab4 vs. PD1Ab2: p < 0.0001; PD1Ab4 vs. PD1Ab3: p = 0.0009). c Pearson
correlation analysis revealed that anti-hPD1 titers strongly correlated with crisprTF
promoter strengths (r = 0.99, R2 = 0.99, p = 0.0051). d Schematic diagram of CHO-

explore the utility of our crisprTF promoter platform for cellular therapy. dLP-CHO
cells engineered with one of the above four conﬁgurations for anti-hPD1 secretion
were ﬁrst seeded for 48 hours. The control group was seeded with EYFP−/EBFP+
dLP-CHO cells with no anti-hPD1 payload circuit. Pre-activated human T cells and
human ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR8) expressing a surface T-cell engager were
subsequently seeded in each well with the attached dLP-CHO cell populations.

On the other hand, introns, which enhance gene expression in
mammalian cells when applied as a positive regulatory element45, have
been proposed to control post-transcriptional RNA processing or
transport35. Here, the incorporation of an SI immediately downstream
of the operator in the 5′ UTR of the target gene46 increased gene
expression at least 200% with nearly all tested constructs, whether
episomal or chromosomal, suggesting a high degree of compatibility
between the transcriptional control by the crisprTF promoters and the
intron-mediated enhancement by SI47. RT-qPCR data also suggest that
an SI in the 5′ UTR directly contributes to gene transcription in our
crisprTF promoter system, consistent with gene expression enhance-
ment by 5′ UTR sequences48. However, overly strong target gene
expression may impact cell proliferation (Fig. 5e). Thus, it is essential
to balance target gene expression with cellular homeostasis when
employing strong crisprTF promoters. Moreover, the large size of the
crisprTF promoter constructs, especially with additional genetic reg-
ulatory elements, limits their use with LP-engineered cells for long-
term expression. Broader applications in biomedicine may require
minimizing construct size.
CHO cells, approved by regulatory agencies, are widely used by
the pharmaceutical industry for the biomanufacturing of recombinant
therapeutic proteins with human-like glycosylation proﬁles49,50. CMVp
and Simian virus 40 early promoter are frequently used in CHO cells to
produce high titers of therapeutic proteins51. Yet, protein-producing
cell lines often exhibit a wide range of gene expression proﬁles, even at
the clonal level, and the mechanisms that drive viral promoters in
eukaryotic cells are ill-deﬁned52,53. Natural promoters have often
evolved synchronously with functionalities that depend on speciﬁc
genetic contexts, so promoter activity may not transfer across various
genes, conditions, or species39,53. The growing number of biother-
apeutic proteins in development has created an increasing demand for
efﬁcient long-term protein expression systems for biomanufacturing,
ideally with built-in programmable control for improved consistency
and predictable yields.
Coupled with the LP technology, we demonstrated the long-term
stability of precisely tuned human mAb production with the crisprTF
promoter system. Antibody yields obtained with the strongest
crisprTF circuit expressing a single mAb LC/HC cassette were similar to
those obtained with two or six mAb cassettes driven by CMV or EF1α
promoters, respectively, in LP-engineered CHO cells30. The high pro-
duction efﬁciency of our strong crisprTF circuits, along with their built-
in modularity and scalability, suggests that they can be adapted to
achieve industrially relevant mAb titers. Our platform may also be
applied, more generally, to CHO strains optimized for industrial bior-
eactor conditions to: (1) increase target protein production in a pre-
dictable and controlled manner; (2) produce multiple target proteins
simultaneously with speciﬁc ratios; and (3) strike a balance between
cell behaviors and protein production in long-term cultures.
To exogenously modulate target gene expression by controlling
gRNA transcription levels, we incorporated two types of small
molecule-inducible switches into the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) pro-
moter (Supplementary Fig. 14a). The results in the episomal context
indicate that gRNA transcription could be tuned by adjusting the
concentrations of the inducers doxycycline (Dox) and isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for Tet and Lac operons, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 14b, c), following gene expression kinetics at
different time points (Supplementary Fig. 14d). Thus, an additional
layer of target gene tunability could be achieved in our crisprTF pro-
moter system by using inducible Pol III promoters.
In conclusion, we have built a tunable, scalable, and sustainable
gene expression system of crisprTF-based regulatory elements. This
platform should enable programmable, multiplexed gene modulation
for broad applications, such as mammalian synthetic biology, bioma-
nufacturing, and precision medicine.
Methods
Molecular cloning and genetic circuit construction
All genetic circuits in this study were constructed using a modular
Gateway-Gibson assembly method33,54. Brieﬂy, gRNAs and related
sequences were commercially synthesized (Integrated DNA Technol-
ogies IDT and GenScript) and then cloned into corresponding entry
vectors using In-Fusion cloning (Takara Bio, San Jose, CA, USA) or a
one-step Gibson reaction with the in-house master mix. Other genetic
parts were cloned into corresponding entry vectors using the same
approach. Multi-site LR reactions were performed between a promoter
entry vector ﬂanked by attL4 and attR1 recombination sites, a gene
entry vector ﬂanked by attL1 and attL2 recombination sites, and
pZDonor_Seq(n)-GTW-Seq(n + 1)_R4_R2 destination vectors containing
a Gateway cassette (chloramphenicol resistance and ccdB genes
ﬂanked by attR4 and attR2 recombination sites) to generate positional
expression vectors [i.e., independent transcriptional units (TUs) in
different position vectors used for the subsequent Gibson assembly]33.
Gibson reactions were performed with the Gibson Assembly Ultra Kit
(SGI-DNA, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 50 °C for 60 min, using equimolar
concentrations (~40–60 fmol per 10 μL reaction) of column-puriﬁed
positional expression vectors (cleaved with I-SceI), a matching adaptor
vector (cleaved with XbaIand XhoI), and a carrier vector with BxB1-attB
or
BxB1-GA-attB
integration sites
(cleaved
with
FseI).
Gibson-
assembled constructs were diluted at 1:4 and used to transform E.
coli 10 G electrocompetent cells (60080-2, Lucigen, Middleton, WI,
US). Cells were selected with appropriate antibiotics on solid and
liquid culture; plasmids were column-puriﬁed with QIAprep Spin
Miniprep Kit (27106, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After veriﬁcation by
restriction mapping analysis and Sanger sequencing of payload TUs,
correctly assembled constructs were expanded in 25 mL liquid culture
with Stbl3 chemically competent cells (C737303, Invitrogen) and
column-puriﬁed with QIAGEN Plasmid Plus Midi Kit (12945, Qiagen). A
schematic diagram of the gene circuit construction methodology is
shown in Fig. 1a. Human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1α) promoter and
mouse CMVp were used as constitutive promoter controls. Sp-dCas9-
VPR was a gift from George Church (Addgene plasmid 63798)22.
pRRL.CMVenh.gp91.Syn.Intron.eGFP was a gift from Didier Trono
(Addgene plasmid 30470), which was used for cloning the 230-bp
synthetic intron sequence55. MS2-P65-HSF1_GFP was a gift from Feng
Zhang (Addgene plasmid 61423), which was used for cloning the MS2-
P65-HSF1 gene sequences26. Genetic sequences and construct maps
were viewed and edited with Geneious 9.0 (Dotmatics, Boston, MA,
USA). The sequences of genetic parts and the list of plasmids are
provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
LP vector construction
LP donor vectors for stable CRISPR-Cas9-mediated integration into
the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell genomes were constructed as
previously reported30. Brieﬂy, homology arm sequences for LP1-2, LP2,
LP8, LP15, and LP20 integration sites (each arm approximately
0.5–1 kb long) were synthesized as a single gBlock (IDT) containing a
PmeI restriction site between the left and right homology arms and
unique BsaI cleavage sites in the 5′ and 3′ termini for Golden Gate
cloning30. Each gBlock was cloned into a pIDTsmart vector modiﬁed to
contain compatible BsaI cloning sites. LP cassettes containing hEF1α-
attP-BxB1-EYFP-P2A-Hygro (cassette 1), hEF1α-attP-BxB1-EBFP-P2A-Bla
(cassette 2), or hEF1α-attP-BxB1-GA-EYFP-P2A-Hygro (cassette 3) were
constructed using modular Gateway-Gibson cloning as previously
described33,54. LP cassettes were cloned into PmeI-linearized pIDTs-
mart backbones between the left and right homology arms using In-
Fusion cloning (Takara Bio USA). Using this approach, we generated
the following LP donor vectors: LP1-2-cassette 1, LP2-cassette 1, LP2-
cassette 2, LP8-cassette 2, LP15-cassette 2, LP20-cassette 2, and LP20-
cassette 34,30.

For human embryonic kidney (HEK)−293 cells, the LP donor vec-
tor was integrated into the AAVS1 locus using engineered zinc ﬁnger
nucleases (ZFN) as previously described54. Brieﬂy, 800 bp homology
arm sequences for the AAVS1 locus, on the 5′ and 3′-ends of the ZFN cut
site, were cloned into ﬂanking position vectors. A center position
vector was assembled to encode a double cHS4 core insulator, the CAG
promoter, attP BxB1, EYFP-2A-Hygromycin, a rabbit beta-globin poly-
adenylation signal, and another double cHS4 core insulator. These
three-position vectors were veriﬁed and then assembled into the LP
Shuttle Vector. A DNA fragment encoding the two DNA-binding ZF
domains for the AAVS1 locus, separated by a 2A self-cleavage peptide
sequence, was synthesized (GeneArt, Regensburg, Germany) and
cloned into an expression vector with CAG promoter via Gateway
assembly to create the ZFN-expressing vector.
Cell culture and plasmid transfection
Adherent wild-type CHO-K1 cells (CCL-61, American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA) and engineered CHO cells were
maintained in complete Ham’s F12K (cHams-F12K) medium (30-2004,
ATCC) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (F2442, Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, MO, USA), 1% HyClone non-essential amino acids
(SH30238.01, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (15140-122, Gibco by Life Sciences). Cells
were grown in a humidiﬁed 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and passaged
every 2–3 days. Transfections were carried out with the Neon elec-
troporation system (MPK5000, Invitrogen) with 10 µl Neon tips.
Brieﬂy, 1 × 105 cells were suspended in R buffer and mixed well with
250 ng of individual experimental and transfection marker plasmids
for 10–15 min at room temperature (RT). To ensure that all samples
had the same total amount of plasmids, we supplemented the negative
or positive control samples with a dummy plasmid composed of an
identical expression vector backbone and a non-functional insert
sequence. Cells were then electroporated with the setting of 1560 V/
5 ms/10 pulses. Transfected cells were immediately transferred to a 24-
well plate containing 1 mL complete culture medium without any
antimicrobial reagents. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis was performed at 48 hours post-transfection. Experiments
were performed with independently transfected biological triplicates.
HEK293T cells (CRL-3216), mouse C2C12 myoblasts (CRL-1772),
and rat H9c2 cardiac myoblasts (CRL-1446) were purchased from
ATCC. All three cell types were thawed and expanded according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and subsequently maintained in Dulbec-
co’s Modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM; 10569-044, Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S.
Transfections were carried out with ViaFect transfection reagent
(E4982, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Brieﬂy, cells were washed once
with PBS, trypsinized, and re-suspended with complete culture med-
ium at 1 × 105 cells per 100 μL. Experimental and transfection marker
plasmids (250 ng each) were added to 100 μL plain Opti-MEM medium
(31985-070, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and mixed well with ViaFect at a
1:3 ratio (total DNA by weight: ViaFect by volume), according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. After incubating at RT for 10 min,
1 × 105 cells were added to the plasmid/ViaFect mixture and mixed well.
Transfected cells were immediately transferred to a 24-well plate
containing 0.8 mL complete culture medium without any anti-
microbial reagents. FACS analysis was performed at 48 hours post-
transfection.
The PGP1 hiPSCs were a gift from George Church (Harvard Uni-
versity, MA, USA) and cultivated in compliance with the MIT IRB pro-
tocol (BRR 836)56. Brieﬂy, culture plates were coated with Matrigel
Matrix (354277, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA), following the manu-
facturer’s protocol, and incubated for >1 hour at 37 °C prior to plating.
hiPSCs were cultured in StemFlex medium (A3349401), split with a ﬁve-
minute treatment of StemPro Accutase (A1110501, both from Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) at 37 °C every 3–4 days, and plated on Matrigel-
coated plates at an appropriate density with ROCK inhibitor (1254,
Tocris Bioscience, UK) at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 μM for 24 hours to
improve viability. hiPSCs were reverse transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamine Stem transfection reagent (STEM00001) and Opti-MEM
(31985088, both from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in 12-well plates in
triplicate according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol.
Brieﬂy, cells were cultured until they reached 40–50% conﬂuence at
transfection. Experimental and transfection marker plasmids (250 ng
each) were added to 25 μL plain Opti-MEM I medium and mixed with
25 μL diluted Lipofectamine Stem transfection reagent (1:1 ratio), fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubating at RT for 10 min,
50 μL DNA-lipid complexes were applied to each well. At 48 hours
post-transfection with ~1 × 105 cells per well, hiPSCs were harvested
with StemPro Accutase, washed three times with PBS (10010-023,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), subjected to ﬁltration with a 35-micron cell
strainer, and then run on a ﬂow cytometer for FACS analysis.
Engineering LP cells
Single- and multi-LP CHO cell lines with engineered LP1-2, LP2, LP8,
LP15, and LP20 loci were constructed in adherent CHO-K1 cells by
homologous recombination with CRISPR/Cas9 as described30. Brieﬂy,
targeted integrations were performed by co-transfecting 500 ng of
circular LP donor vector with 40 ng of px330-U6-chimeric_BB-CBh-
hSpCas9 vector, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid 42230)57,
and 150 ng of U6-gRNA GeneArt DNA String (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Roughly 105 cells were transfected in triplicate with the Neon electro-
poration system with 10 µl Neon tips and seeded in 24-well plate. Cells
were then transferred to a six-well plate at 3 days post-transfection and
subjected to antibiotic selection with either hygromycin (600 µg/ml;
ant-hg-1, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) or blasticidin (10 µg/ml; ant-
bl-1, InvivoGen) for two weeks, followed by clonal cell sorting with
FACS. Clonal cells were veriﬁed with diagnostic PCR using locus-
speciﬁc and LP-speciﬁc primers (for on-target integration) and
backbone-speciﬁc primers (for off-target integration). Single-cell
clones exhibiting locus-speciﬁc and backbone-free integration, as
well as stable and homogenous LP expression, were expanded,
banked, and subsequently used for gene circuit integration.
The single-LP HEK293 cell line was constructed with an engi-
neered AAVS1 locus by homologous recombination with ZFN in wild-
type adherent HEK293 cells as described54. Brieﬂy, HEK293 cells were
co-transfected with equimolar amounts of the ZFN-expressing vector
and the LP Shuttle Vector, allowed to recover for 72 hours, and then
selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks. Single-cell clones
exhibiting locus-speciﬁc integration and stable LP expression were
generated by serial dilutions of the surviving population and subse-
quently expanded for gene circuit integration.
Chromosomal integration of gene circuits
For chromosomal integration of gene circuits in adherent, engineered
CHO and HEK293 cells, cells were independently transfected in tripli-
cate with 500 ng of the BxB1 integrase-expressing plasmid (pEXPR-
CAG-BxB1) and 500 ng DNA of the payload plasmid, using the Neon
electroporation system with the same setting as described above.
Transfected cells were immediately transferred to a 24-well plate con-
taining 1 mL complete culture medium per well without any anti-
microbial reagents. At 3 days post-transfection, cells were transferred
to a 6-well plate with 3 mL complete culture medium per well, followed
by one of the following one-time cell selection strategies (depending on
the individual payload construct designs described in the Results sec-
tion and ﬁgures): (1) for single integrants in single-LP (sLP), cells were
selected with puromycin only (8 µg/ml for CHO and 1 µg/ml for HEK293;
A11138-03, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for gene circuits with a single
selection marker, or with both puromycin (8 µg/ml) and blasticidin
(10 µg/mL) for gene circuits with both selection markers; (2) for single
integrants in double LP (dLP), cells were selected with either puromycin

(8 µg/mL) alone or with hygromycin (250 µg/mL) and G418 (250 µg/mL)
for the payload integrated in the LP2 locus, and with blasticidin
(10 µg/mL) for the non-integrated, empty LP15 locus; (3) for double
integrants in dLP, cells were selected with puromycin (8 μg/mL), blas-
ticidin (10 µg/mL), hygromycin (250 µg/mL), and G418 (250 µg/mL; ant-
gn-1, InvivoGen). Following 10 days of selection, correct integration was
conﬁrmed by FACS, indicated by the complete disappearance of native
LP ﬂuorescence: either enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent protein (EYFP), or
enhanced blue ﬂuorescent protein (EBFP), or both. Cells with chro-
mosomally integrated gene circuits were maintained as pooled popu-
lations after selection. Cell viability and density were monitored with a
Vi-CELL automated cell viability analyzer (Beckman-Coulter).
Fluorescent imaging
All ﬂuorescent images were taken with the EVOS FL Auto cell imaging
system (AMAFD1000, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) equipped with multi-
ple LED light cubes, including TagBFP, GFP, YFP, RFP, and Texas Red.
Fluorescent images of the same color were taken with the same
exposure settings. Scale bars were directly printed in the images.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Cells were analyzed with an LSRFortessa ﬂow cytometer, equipped
with 405, 488, and 561 nm lasers (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Thirty thousand events per sample were collected for analysis of the
median signal intensity of the transfected population, using a 488 nm
laser and 530/30 nm bandpass ﬁlter for EYFP and a 405 nm laser, 450/
50 ﬁlter for EBFP. Sphero rainbow calibration particles, 8 peaks (RCP-
30-5A, Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL, USA) were used for instrument
normalization and MEFL calculation. Median ﬂuorescent intensity of
the entire transfected population (i.e., all cells positive for both
experimental and transfection marker signals) or the entire chromo-
somally integrated cell pool was measured in histograms (for single
color) or dot-plots (for two or more colors). The same gating was used
in all experiments (cutoff value set at 200 A.U. on the x axis of the
histogram or on both x- and y axis of the dot-plot). Data were analyzed
with FACSDiva software version 8.0.1 (BD Biosciences), FlowJo (FlowJo
LLC, Ashland, OR, USA), and FCS Express 6 (De Novo Software, Pasa-
dena, CA, USA). Flow cytometry data were largely normalized to the
EF1α control and presented as relative median signal intensity (%).
Some ﬂuorescent intensity data shown as A.U. (not % of the EF1α
control) represent the original readout of the ﬂuorescent intensity
from the ﬂow cytometer without normalizing to the control group.
Cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences)
in the Swanson Biotechnology Center Flow Cytometry Facility at the
Koch Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA). Untransfected CHO-K1 and
HEK293 cells and unintegrated single- and multi-LP cells were used to
set the gating. Different selection and sorting schemes were applied to
target payload integration into speciﬁc LP sites, including: (1) single-
positive/single negative (EYFP+/EBFP−or EYFP−/EBFP+), (2) double-
negative
(EYFP−/EBFP−),
or
(3)
double-negative/mKate-positive
(EYFP−/EBFP−/mKate+) to select multi-LP cells with the payload(s)
integrated into each designated LP. For pooled cell sorting, all sorted
cells were initially seeded at 5000–10,000 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates
with 1 mL complete culture medium containing no antibiotics. For
clonal cell sorting, single cells were initially sorted into ﬂat-bottom 96-
well plates with 100 μL complete culture medium containing no anti-
biotics for clonal expansion and subsequently selected and expanded
in 24-well and six-well plates and T75 ﬂasks.
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis
Chromosomally integrated CHO cells (3 × 106) were collected for RNA
extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus kit (74034,
Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis
was performed using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out in a
LightCycler 96 System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using a KAPA SYBR
FAST qPCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer sequences of mKate and
GAPDH for RT-qPCR are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Human antibody production and detection
A geneticcircuit expressing one copy of dCas9-VPR was ﬁrst integrated
into dLP-CHO cell lines. Cells were selected once with hygromycin
(250 µg/mL) and G418 (250 µg/mL) for 10 days, followed by FACS
sorting into a pool of single-positive cells using the LP-ﬂuorescent
reporters. A second, crisprTF-driven gene circuit expressing a human
mAb, either JUG444 (Pﬁzer, Andover, MA, USA) or an anti-hPD1 (5C4)10,
was then integrated into the sorted cells. Doubly integrated cells were
selected once by incubating them for 10 days with puromycin (8 µg/
mL), blasticidin (10 µg/mL), hygromycin (250 µg/mL), and G418
(250 µg/mL), followed by FACS sorting into a pool of double-negative
(EYFP−/EBFP−) cells using the LP-ﬂuorescent reporters. All experi-
ments were performed with three independently transfected biologi-
cal replicates. For mAb expression analysis, 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded
in 24-well plates with 0.5 ml cHams-F12K medium per well without any
antibiotics and maintained at 37 °C for 4 days. Conditioned media were
collected on day 4 for measurements. For long-term mAb expression
analysis, master cultures were maintained and passaged accordingly
for up to 5 weeks with measurements performed on the same day
weekly. The amount of secreted JUG444 or anti-hPD1 was measured in
duplicate with the Octet RED96 system (ForteBio, Fremont, CA, USA)
using Protein A biosensors (18-5010, ForteBio). Puriﬁed JUG444 or anti-
hPD1 was used to generate a standard curve, from which the mAb titers
were derived. Doubling time of each mAb-expressing cell population
was estimated by the proliferation of 5 × 104 cells after 2 days of culture
and subsequently compared with that of singly-occupied dLP-CHO
cells without any mAb gene circuit.
CHO-tumor-T-cell co-culture model and anti-tumor activity
analysis
dLP-CHO cells with an integrated gene circuit expressing anti-hPD1
(5C4) were seeded into a 12-well plate in triplicate at a density of 1 × 105
cells/well with 1 mL CHO cell culture medium. Cells were incubated at
37 °C for 48 hours. Pre-activated human T cells and human ovarian
cancer cells (OVCAR8) expressing a surface T-cell engager10 were
mixed at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 20:1 (1 × 106:0.5 × 105 cells)
in 1 mL T-cell culture medium (RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 10 mM
HEPES, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and
50 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol) and then added to each well containing
attached dLP-CHO cells. OVCAR8 was a gift from Sangeeta N. Bhatia
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Co-cultures
of three cell types (CHO, OVCAR8, and T cells) were incubated at 37 °C.
Cell-free supernatants were collected and processed at 24 hours and
stored at −20 °C. As an indicator of the T-cell response to tumor cells in
the presence of actively secreted anti-hPD1 from dLP-CHO cells,
interferon (IFN)-γ produced by T cells was quantiﬁed. IFN-γ con-
centrations in cell-free supernatants were determined by Human IFN-γ
DuoSet enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DY285; R&D systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). EYFP−/EBFP+ dLP-CHO cells with no anti-hPD1
payload circuit were used as the control cells.
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistical differences between groups were analyzed by two-tailed
Student’s t test (for two groups), one-way ANOVA (for multiple
groups), or two-way ANOVA (for long-term stability measurements)
with 95% conﬁdence interval. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p ≤0.05.
A Dunnett or a Tukey test was performed to correct for multiple
comparisons in ANOVA posthoc analysis. All statistical analyses,
including correlation analysis and linear regression, were performed
