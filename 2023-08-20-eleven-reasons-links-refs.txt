Eleven reasons why nuclear power has no future 
 
By Sam Arnold and Ann McAllister, Coalition for Responsible Energy Development in New Brunswick (CRED-NB) 
 
Nuclear power is dirty and dangerous now and for many generations to come. The following eleven reasons 
make the case for why nuclear has no future. 
 
• Nuclear power is too slow to help mitigate the climate crisis. Nuclear projects take an average of 10 years 
to complete.1 In contrast, the Burchill Wind Farm near Saint John, NB took three and a half years from 
partnership to full deployment.2 The most advanced small modular nuclear reactor (SMNR), NuScale in the 
USA, pushed back its completion date from 2016 to 2029,3 but it could take years longer. Moreover, 
NuScale uses the same technology as most large reactors globally.4 Having experienced this much delay, 
what challenges could await novel technologies like ARC’s and Moltex’s small modular nuclear reactors 
(SMNRs) proposed for Point Lepreau, neither of which has ever operated successfully at commercial 
scale?5 
 
• Nuclear power is too expensive compared to the alternatives. Wind and solar both undercut nuclear 
power rates. The authoritative Lazard energy analysis for 2023 6 costed storage-backed onshore wind and 
solar at US $42 to $114 per megawatt-hour, compared to nuclear power at US $141 to $221. Power from 
SMNRs will probably be more expensive than electricity from large nuclear plants which have a history of 
cost increases. 7 Crucially, SMNRs can’t take advantage of the economies of scale 8 which large reactors do. 
There are no large orders for SMNRs, making it unlikely that multiple units will ever be built. 9  
 
• Chronic exposure to radioactive pollutants emitted from large and small nuclear power plants can 
damage human health. 10 For example, the thyroid absorbs radioactive iodine as readily as it does the 
non-radioactive form, putting children at particular risk of thyroid disease and cancer. 11 Chronic exposure 
to radioactive materials, even at low doses, increases the incidence of cancer, leukemia, 12 anemia, genetic 
damage which can be passed from parent to child, immune system damage, strokes, heart attacks, and 
low intelligence. 
 
• Liquid sodium and molten salt reactors pre-dating ARC’s and Moltex’s small modular nuclear reactor 
(SMNR) designs were unreliable and dangerous. Internationally, sodium reactors have not performed 
reliably, and one in Russia experienced repeated fires. 13 In the 1960s, the US Molten Salt Reactor 
Experiment (1965-1969) operated at only 40% capacity 14 compared to 90% for the average US commercial 
nuclear power plant. 
 
• Nuclear power does not work effectively with renewable energy. A University of Sussex study 15 of 123 
countries over 25 years found that countries that invested in renewable energy reduced more carbon 
emissions than countries with large percentages of nuclear power. Contrary to the claim that nuclear 
energy and renewables work well together, the study found that they crowd each other out.  
 
• Carbon emissions must be lowered by a minimum 40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030 to avoid the 
worst impacts of climate breakdown. SMNRs won’t be ready in time, 16 and better technologies already 
exist. Renewables with storage, energy efficiency and conservation, demand-side management, and 
interties such as the Atlantic Loop can provide reliable baseload electricity. 17 To wait for the SMNR silver 
bullet, which may never come, is to court climate catastrophe.

• Radioactive waste remains an unsolved challenge and will be an ongoing cost to taxpayers into the far 
future. Deep geological repositories (DGRs) for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste fuel are not yet 
operational anywhere in the world (not even Finland 18 and Sweden) 19, and the two locations (Ignace 20 
and Saugeen Ojibway Nation) 21 under consideration in Ontario are opposed by many, including 
Indigenous peoples.22 A little-known fact is that while the waste fuel is the responsibility of the federal 
government, New Brunswick is responsible for the steel and concrete building materials which will 
ultimately become radioactive demolition rubble. 23 Would any New Brunswicker accept having a nuclear 
waste dump in or near their community? 
 
• Most Indigenous leaders and First Nations are highly skeptical of nuclear reactors, nuclear waste, and 
environmental risks, such as groundwater contamination, posed by the long-term storage of such 
wastes. First Nations in Ontario and Quebec 24 do not want radioactive waste from New Brunswick in their 
territories. Nuclear does not align with their sacred principle of caring for the next seven generations. 
Federal and provincial governments have a history of not consulting First Nations 25 and ignoring their 
concerns about nuclear installations. 
 
• Transporting radioactive nuclear waste long distances to a proposed geological repository would come 
with higher costs and increased risk of accidents. With a DGR proposed for northern Ontario, the 
transport distance from Point Lepreau could exceed 2,000 kilometers. Considering the frequency of 
accidents involving transport trucks 26 and freight trains, 27 ask yourself if you would feel comfortable with 
radioactive loads 28 passing your home several times weekly for the next 40-plus years? 29 Would you feel 
confident that no accidents or spills would ever occur on a highway or railway track, in a town, or into one 
of the many waterways the trucks and trains would cross? To prevent such catastrophes, 
decommissioned nuclear reactors and their accumulated wastes must be stored where they are presently 
located. 
 
• Nuclear weapons are dependent on energy from the plutonium produced at nuclear power plants, 
making them collaborators in all nuclear weapons produced. Moltex Energy’s technology for separating 
plutonium, the explosive in atomic bombs, from nuclear waste fuel increases the risk of nuclear weapons 
proliferation. Moltex’s claim that the plutonium would be too impure for use in nuclear weapons has been 
repeatedly discredited, most recently in a 2022 report from the US National Academy of Sciences and 
Medicine. The experts stated that while the method might delay the plutonium’s use in weapons, it would 
not prevent it. 30 Nine US non-proliferation experts who advised six US presidents warned the Trudeau 
government that plutonium separation “will undermine the global nuclear weapons non-proliferation 
regime 31 that Canada has done so much to strengthen”. 
 
•  The cost of decommissioning nuclear reactors must be added to all expenses incurred at every link in 
the nuclear chain, from mining and fuel fabrication to perpetual waste storage, from domestic safety and 
security to international proliferation prevention, from policy to regulation, from design to final 
disposition. The public is paying for these cumulative costs; 32 the tally must be made public. 
 
Knowing the dangers of nuclear power will, we hope, awaken people to the environmental, financial, and 
social liabilities it will impose on them and their descendants, and galvanize them to demand that their 
government representatives act in the public’s best interest.

17 “The amount of electricity coming from a given solar array is really rather predictable and tends to come 
best in periods of light winds. And wind turbines do best when the sun is not shining brightest, so they 
complement each other. But more to the point, while a single wind turbine can be idled in calm weather, the 
wind never stops blowing over wider geographical areas. We might ask whether the problem of variable 
output of wind and solar power is as big as the problem of inability of baseload power to follow loads.” George
