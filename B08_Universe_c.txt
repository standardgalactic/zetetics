8. A Model of the Universe Based on the Unified 
Field Theory 
 
In this book about physics of elementary processes the last 
scientific section is dedicated to global predictions of the model 
for the Unified Field Theory (UFT). The discussion about the 
universe starts with a qualitative review of celestial mechanics. 
Then, the development of stars and galaxies is briefly mentioned 
and the predictions are set in relation to ‘well known’ and 
scientifically discussed processes in curved spaces; to building of 
black holes, to the existences of Schwarzschild radii, to the 
expansion of the universe and big bang and to inflations and 
membranes. All of these perceptions are unknown in a model of 
open physical systems with four kinds of stable particles and with 
two non-conservative fundamental interactions between those. 
The Unified Field Theory describes the physical processes in a 
finite and open Minkowski space with exception of small space-
time domains around the elementary particles. The lack of 
knowledge in very small domains can be handled with space 
integrals which have finite values and are known as invariant 
elementary charges. The theory uses only few numbers of 
invariants and a generalized Boltzmann constant for the 
equilibrium.    
The non-equivalence of gravitational mass m g  and inertial mass 
m i , in order of pro mille gives the greatest deviation from the 
Newtonian gravity. However, the deviation is composition 
dependent. With 
 
m
i (matter) = m g  (1-(matter)).    
(1) 
 
The quantity (matter) >0 is the mass defect of the matter and 
can bee calculated from the mass defects of isotopes if the 
composition of matter is known, Ref. [1]. The small value of 

 
 
2
(matter) ~ 0.75% allows us occasionally to use the simpler 
equation  
 
m g (matter) = m i (1+ (matter)),  or m g  = m i (1+), 
(1’) 
 
 if we need to, without warning in the qualitative discussion of 
this part.  
For the universal gravitational constant G we shall use, see Ref. 
[1], the value  
 
G = 6.576(6)x10
11
 m 3 kg

s

, 
(2) 
 
which is ~ 1.5 % smaller than the CODATA value (1998) 
 
G = 6.673(10)x10
11
 m 3 kg
1
s
2
. 
(3) 
 
Newton’s static equation of motion in the gravitational field has 
to be modified to 
 
m i a = m g  (1- (matter)) a = - G M g  m g  / r 2 . 
(4) 
 
which is composition dependent. 
Kepler’s third law appears in the form of 
 
R j
3 /T j
2 x (1+m i
j /M i ) = G M g  (m g
j /m i
j ) = G M g (1-(j), (5) 
 
for the planet j. The evaluation of (5) offers a 0.15% deviation, 
Ref. [2], with the nine planets of the sun. Therefore, I see the 
greatest deviation in celestial mechanics of our theory from the 
Newtonian gravity in the deviations of Kepler’s third law. 
Moreover, the outer planets have smaller mass defects (j) than 
the inner planets. The known constituent of the outer planets are 
elements or compounds of elements with small mass defect. Such 

 
 
3
elements are H, He, C, N and O. The mass defect of these 
elements, without H, are 0.63(7)%, see Tab. 1 in Ref. [1].  The 
inner or terrestrial planets have an excess of elements Fe and Ni 
in their kernels. These elements have a large mass defect, about 
0.78%.  Thus, the composition dependencies of the planets 
explain very well the deviations of Kepler’s third law. In other 
words, the evaluation of equation (5) confirms our theory of 
gravitation and should be used for information about the 
composition of the planets.   
In order to calculate further deviations between our theory and the 
Newtonian gravity, the next step leads to equation of motion with 
moving masses. We remember that the gravitational mass of 
matter arises from the gravitational charge 
 
 m g (matter)  = g(matter)/g, 
(6) 
 
whereby g  is the specific gravitational charge which produces the 
gravitational constant 
 
G = g 2 / 4 . 
(7) 
 
The motion of a gravitational charge g i  in the gravitational field, 
described with E g  and B g , arises from a force F g ,  
 
F g  = - g i (E g  + v/cx B g ). 
(8) 
 
which takes with v/c the velocity of the mass into account. This 
equation is similar to the Lorentz equation of a moving electric 
charge q i  in the electromagnetic field E e  and B e  
 
F e  = + q i (E e +v/c xB e ). 
(9)

Which phenomena in celestial mechanics can support the 
existence of the force F g ? First, the nearly circular orbits of most 
planets have to be mentioned. Without the velocity- dependent 
part of the force, all elliptic orbits with the same semi major axis 
would be equally probable. Furthermore, the 43 arcseconds per 
century shift of the perihelium of Mercury can be also used to test 
the theory. In contrary, this test has been considered up to now as 
the first confirmation of Einstein’s theory of gravity. We have 
here a possible other explanation of this most favour deviation of 
Newton’s theory of gravity. 
Other unexplained deviations have been observed in the 
trajectories of some space missions. The Pioneer 10 and 11 
spacecrafts and the Voyager 1 and 2 offered deviations from the 
usual calculated trajectories. The Pioneer spacecrafts have been 
affected by an unexpected tiny deceleration force. The velocity 
dependent part of the force (8) can be used to recalculate the 
trajectories. 
Another aspect of our theory comes from the considerations of the 
planet orbits as stationary solutions of variation calculations. 
Some researchers recognized a “quantisation rule” of the satellite 
orbits moving around a central star, Ref [3]. The rule is similar to 
the quantized orbits of an electron in Bohr’s theory. In the Unified 
Field Theory, we have a common variation principle for the 
electromagnetic field and the gravitational field. To use this 
variation principle in the celestial mechanics offers a completely 
new way to calculate the planet orbits.  
With this comment, I close the possible implications of the new 
theory in celestial mechanics and turn over shortly to another 
apparent confirmation of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, 
to the deflection of light in the gravitational field. Within the 
Unified Field Theory, the gravity and the electromagnetism is 
caused by two types of elementary charges of the particles. 
Therefore, the two fields are independent from each other. The 
stronger electric field does not influence the weaker gravitational 

 
 
5
field and vice versa. Therefore, the apparently measured 
deflection of light in the vicinity of the sun must be reconsidered 
very carefully.  
The Unified Field Theory considers both fundamental fields as 
non-conservative fields. Therefore, the velocity dependent 
expressions for the forces (8) and (9) must be considered in both 
cases as approximations. The energy violating part is not 
contained in these expressions. Can we see some evidence for a 
non-conservative gravity in the universe? Yes, we can probably 
do it. The observations of double neutron stars by astrophysicists 
offer a decreasing of the relative distances of the objects. This 
decrease can probably be explained with the radiation of 
gravitation waves by fast moving neutron stars which is described 
completely with the field equations of the gravitational field and 
which explains the energy loss. 
Another possible confirmation of the new theory can arise from 
the two types of condensation of matter. The one type uses 
protons and electrons and the other type eltons and positrons. Our 
matter condenses with proton and electron. Now between the two 
kinds of condensed matter rules a repulsive gravitational force. A 
proton-galaxy removes itself from an elton-galaxy. The removal 
of the galaxies from each other can be observed as the Doppler 
effect of the emitted light. Thus, we get an explanation of the red 
shift of far galaxies because of the existence of repulsive 
gravitation. In this sense, the red shift of light is not the evidence 
of an expansion of the universe and not a confirmation of the big 
bang theory for the beginning of the development our universe. In 
our theory the four types of elementary particles are stable; they 
can never be generated and can never annihilate. The approximate 
stability of proton is believed to be 10 30  s which is much longer 
than the age of the universe 3x10 17 s after the big bang. The 
stability of elementary particles and the assumed age of the 
universe are controversial anyhow. Therefore, I believe that the 
state of the universe in a finite space-time domain  is in 

 
 
6
equilibrium with the rest of the universe outside of . The 
spectrum of the back ground radiation at a temperature of 2.72 K 
could be the equilibrium temperature of the universe. Since I 
consider the properties of the fields as to be conserved (the 
Lorentz condition), and the propagation of fields with the velocity 
c is invariant; I suppose that the equilibrium temperature was 2.72 
K before 15x10 9  years too. In other words, the universe was 
always in the same global state as it is in the present time. A 
generalized Boltzmann constant, which includes also the dark 
matter discussed later on, would be able to describe the 
equilibrium of the universe. The universe itself changes only local 
but not global. The radical local change happens for instance with 
supernova explosions which ends the development of stars and 
begins a new one.  
In order to understand the supernova explosions, I have to explain 
the development of neutron stars and the role of neutrinos in the 
universe. Our theory fixes two kinds of neutrinos, the electron-
neutrino 
e
 = (e,p) with a size of 7.03x10
14
 cm = 0.703 fm and 
the proton-neutrino 
P
 = (P,E) with a size of 3.83x10
17
cm = 
0.383x10
3
  fm. Both neutrinos are the ingredients of the dark 
matter, but they play a different role in the condensation of 
matter. The electron-neutrinos built the nuclear forces; this 
neutrino binds the protons and electrons together to an atomic 
nucleus. A stable neutron (P,e) has also the size of the electron-
neutrino, Ref. [6]. Under normal conditions, the proton-neutrino 
does not interact with a nucleus, because it is not only much 
smaller in size but the interactions radius is also smaller than the 
size of the nuclei.  
Let us look for the following processes in the production of matter 
in the sun, Ref. [4]. 
With the mass M Sun = 1.99x10 33  g and radius r Sun = 6.96x1010 
cm the averaged mass density of the sun (the mass density in the 
centre of the sun: 153 g/cm 3 ) is 

 
 
7
 
Sun = M Sun/ (4/3 r Sun
3 ) = 1.41 g/cm 3 . 
(10) 
 
Since the sun is composed of 75% H and 25% He the averaged 
distance of protons is ~ 10
8
 cm. The density of the sun is mainly 
permeable for the e-neutrinos.    
The nuclear reaction are usually written without shell electrons 
  
1
1H + 1
1H = 2
1 H + p +  + 1.44 MeV, 
(11) 
2
1 H + 2
1 H = 3
2 He +  + 5.49 MeV, 
(12) 
3
2 He + 3
2 He = 4
2 He + 2 1
1H + 12.85 MeV. 
(13) 
 
They are considered as the first steps of nuclei condensations, as 
nuclear fusions.  
Within the UFT the first reaction would be the conversion of a 
hydrogen atom in a neutron 1
0 n = (P,e) with production of energy 
H-atom = 1
0 n + 2.04 MeV. 
Such a conversion can take place already at normal pressure and 
density for instance in palladium metal. The stable neutron can 
catch an electron-neutrino 
e
=(e,p) to build an instable neutron 
 
1
0 n + 
e
 = (P,e,p,e). 
 
Therefore, in the sun the hydrogen atoms decrease and the 
neutrons increase, first without building of deuterons.  
Because of the mass density (10) in the sun, the reaction with 
P
 
does not play a role. In the s.c. PP-cycle, calculated first by Bethe 
and Critchfield (1938), the appearing neutrino could be an 
electron-neutrino 
e
. In this case at least two additional e-
neutrinos are needed at the left hand side of (11) for the fusion of 

 
 
8
1
1H + 1
1H = P + P. The conservation of elementary particle 
numbers is would be fulfilled by a reaction 
 
1
1H + 1
1H + 2 
e
 = 2
1 H + p + 1.44 MeV, 
(14) 
 
due to the fact that the deuteron   
 
2
1 H = (P, e, p, e, P), 
(15) 
 
which is a five particle system. But the brought inner energy of 
the two e-neutrinos is with  
 
4 x m e c 2  = 2.04 MeV, 
(16)  
 
too small for the binding energy of  2
1 H in the range of 2.22 MeV 
and for the additional 1.44 MeV. Therefore, another sort of 
particle plays a role in (14) than 
e
; most possibly an electric 
neutral compound (P,
e
,
e
,E) = (P,e,p,e,p,E) which looks like 
a neutral Pion 
0
. Within the UFT, the correct form of reaction 
(11) is  
 
 
1
1H + 
1
1H + 
0
 = 2
1 H + p + 
P
+ 1.44 MeV, 
(17) 
 
with a produced proton-neutrino 
P
 at the right side. The 
P
 can 
leave the sun from the place of reaction because of the small mass 
density.   
In the UFT it is easy to see that 2
2 He can not exists because it 
would be 
 
2
2 He = (P, e, p, P). 
 

 
 
9
One electron-neutrino can not bind two positive charged protons 
together. 
These steps explain the unrecognized uncertainties of all three 
reactions (11)-(13) in respect to neutrinos. The occurrences and 
the meaning of additional electric neutral particles and mass-less 
particles on both sides of the usually written down nuclear 
reactions are uncertain. We recognised this situation already in 
the composition of nuclei: the number of e-neutrinos is unknown 
within a nucleus, Refs. [6, 7]. We do not know how many 
electron-neutrinos are within 3
2 He and 4
2 He. This uncertainty can 
be handled only within model calculations with variation 
principles of the UFT for electric neutral and mass-less particle 
system, whereby the mass-less property means the systems are 
neutral also in respect of the gravitational charges.  
A few words about the neutral Pion have to be said. The most 
popular decay of  
0
 is usually written down as, Ref. [5] 
 
0
  2 . 
(18) 
 
But this reaction is incorrect because of particle number 
conservation. In the UFT the decay (17) must be 
 
*
0

  
0
 + 2 . 
(19) 
 
This equation means the decay of the excited Pion 
*
0

 to its 
ground state 
  
0
 = (P,e,p,e,p,E),  
(20) 
 
by radiation of electromagnetic waves.  
The question, where the neutral Pion derived from, touches the 
problem of dark matter. The UFT consider namely the dark matter 

 
 
10 
as to be consisting of the two kinds of neutrinos, of 
0
 and of 
similar compounds  
 
dark matter = {
P
;
e
;
eP

=(P,e,p,E);  
0
=(P,e,p,e,p,E); (N x P, M x (e,p), N x E)}, 
(21) 
 
with suitable numbers N and M. But the size of 
P
 is 
considerably smaller than the size of all other compounds. The 
compounds in the dark matter can not condensate on each other, 
but most possibly they accumulate within and in the vicinity of 
stars. In several astrophysical models, the dark matter and the 
dark energy give 95% of the whole mass and energy contain of 
the universe. Therefore, the presence of dark matter plays a 
crucial role at the fusion reactions (11) – (13) at the production of 
star matter. Model calculations of the distribution of the dark 
matter will result in more insight in the developments of stars and 
of galaxies.  
The inverse process to production of condensed matter is its 
destruction. Inside of large stars the atoms lost their electron shell 
and the nuclei will be instable. The repulsive Coulomb force 
disbands the constituents of nuclei. The disbanded constituents 
are stable neutrons n 0  = (P,e), e-neutrinos and protons. The free 
protons catch free electrons and build also neutrons. If the free e-
neutrinos remove from the matter only neutrons n 0  remain over a 
pure neutron star is generated. The maximal mass density of such 
neutron stars is in the range of the mass density of nuclei 
 
 = 1.67 x10
24
 g /4.189(0.7x10
13
 cm) 3    
     = 1.16 x 10 15 g/cm 3 . 
(22)  
But, without the stabilizing e-neutrinos of the nuclei, the 
originally stable neutrons n 0  in the inner of neutron star collapse 
further, until they have a size under 10
16
 cm. In all probability, 

 
 
11 
there exists also a stable state of the (P,e) system calculated, Ref. 
[6], with  
 
h  = h 0 /(m P /m e )
2
/
1  = h 0 /44. 
 
In this range of proton-electron distances, the collapsed neutrons 
can interact with the proton-neutrinos which have a 3.83x10
17
 
cm size and under heavy production the supernova explosion 
starts. Shortly before the supernova explosion, the mass density in 
inner regions of neutron stars is the greatest density of condensed 
matter. An estimation of the maximal mass density is given by 
 
max  = 1.67 x10
24
 g /(10
16
) 3  cm 3   = 1.67 x 10 24 g/cm 3 . (23)  
 
This mass density is unbelievable high, but finite. The mass of the 
sun M Sun= 1.989x10 33  g would be compressed in a ball with a 
radius of 6.57 m. The Schwarzschild radius of a mass 1.4 M Sun is 
R S  = 2.95 km. The mass density would be only 
 
S
 = 1.4 M Sun/(4/3 R S
3  ) = 2.59x10 13 g/cm 3 . 
(24) 
 
Nevertheless, the compressed neutron stars before the supernova 
explosion are far from being to be black holes.  
The development of stars begins with a supernova explosion from 
new on. This is a local process only and there is no need for a 
global big bang in order to generate the whole universe at one 
moment in the far past. The big bang theories meet, beside other 
inconsistencies, the discrepancy how the estimated 10 30  s 
stability of elementary particles corresponds with the 1.5 G year’s 
= 4.7x10 17 s age of the universe.  
The 
UFT 
with 
the 
two 
fundamental 
interactions, 
the 
electromagnetic (e.m.) and the gravitational interaction, and with 

 
 
12 
the four kinds of elementary particles (e, p, P and E) describes 
the universe between 10
17
 cm particle distances and the 
detectable 10 10 light-year’s global distances in the (3+1) 
dimensional Minkowski space. The field equations of the e.m.- 
and the g-field are Lagrange equations of a Hamilton principle, 
Ref. [8]. There are no scientific associations necessary about 
curvature of space, more than 4 dimensions, inflation processes, 
super strings and some kinds of membranes.
