Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their de-
scription in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order
interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic
interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological
systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interac-
tions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model
and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression
data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work
reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform
our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from
biology to the climate.

INTRODUCTION
Higher-order
networks
[1–5]
are
key
to
capture
many-body interactions present in complex systems.
Inferring higher-order interactions from real, pairwise
network datasets is recognised as one of the central
challenges in the study of higher-order networks [2].
Despite the increasing attention given to the inference
of higher-order interactions [6–14], the detection of
triadic interactions,
which are prevalent in a wide
variety of complex systems, has been addressed only in
few works [15–17] and remains an important scientific
challenge.
Triadic interactions [18] are a fundamental type of
signed higher-order interaction.
A triadic interaction
occurs when one or more nodes regulate the interaction
between two other nodes.
The regulator nodes may
either enhance or inhibit the interaction between the
other two nodes.
Triadic interactions are known to
be important in various systems such as ecosystems
[19–21] where one species can regulate the interaction
between two species, neuronal networks [22] where glial
cells regulate synaptic transmission between neurons
thereby regulating brain information processing, and
gene regulation networks [16, 23] where a modulator can
promote or silence the interaction between a transcrip-
tion factor and a target gene. Despite evidence of triadic
interactions in specific disciplines (neuroscience, ecology,
molecular biology), the relevance of triadic interactions
as a universal type of higher-order interactions with a
well-defined mathematical definition has only recently
been recognised [18, 24–27].
In this article, we explore the fundamental dynamical
properties of networks with triadic interactions between
continuous variables. We formulate a general model of
networks with triadic interactions, and propose an in-
formation theory framework and the Triaction algorithm
that is able to mine triadic interactions from data. The
Triaction algorithm leverages the induced variability of
the mutual information between a pair of variables when
conditioned on a third regulatory variable.
Using our
method, we show that triadic interactions are important
in gene-expression data where genes can be involved in
‘trigenic’ processes [28].
We apply the Triaction algo-
rithm to a gene-expression network data, and are able
to detect known interactions as well as propose a set of
new candidate interactions that can then be validated
experimentally.

TRIADIC INTERACTIONS
A triadic interaction occurs when one or more nodes
modulate (or regulate) the interaction between two
other nodes, either positively or negatively.
A tri-
adic interaction network is a heterogeneous network
composed of a structural network and a regulatory
network encoding triadic interactions (Figure 1).
The
structural network GS = (V, ES) is formed by a set
V of N nodes and a set ES of L edges.
The regula-
tory network GR = (V, ES, ER) is a signed bipartite
network with one set nodes given by V (the nodes of
the structural network), and another set of nodes given
by ES (edges of the structural network) connected by
the regulatory interactions ER of cardinality |ER| = ˆL.
The signed regulatory network can be encoded as an
L × N matrix K where Kℓi = 1 if node i activates
the structural edge ℓ, Kℓi = −1 if node i inhibits the

Figure 1. (Panel a) A triadic interaction occurs when a node, here shown as Z, regulates either positively or negatively the
interaction between two other nodes X and Y connected in the structural network by an edge. The node Z is also called a
regulator node. This edge can be conceptualised as a factor node (shown here as a cyan diamond). (Panel b) A network with
triadic interactions can be seen as a network of networks formed by a simple structural network and by a bipartite regulatory
network between regulator nodes and regulated edges (factor nodes).
structural edge ℓand Kℓi = 0 otherwise. If Kℓi = 1,
then the node i is called a positive regulator of the
edge ℓ, and if Kℓi = −1, then the node i is called a
negative regulator of the edge ℓ.
It’s worth noting
that node i ∈V cannot serve as both a positive and
negative regulator for the same edge ℓat the same time.
However, node i can act as a positive regulator for
edge ℓwhile simultaneously functioning as a negative
regulator for a different edge, denoted as ℓ′, where ℓ′ ̸= ℓ.
III.
THE CONTINUOUS TRIADIC
INTERACTION MODEL
Here we formulate a general synthetic dynamical model
for a network with triadic interactions between continu-
ous variables. This model acts as a test benchmark to
validate the Triaction algorithm that we propose to de-
tect triadic interactions from continuous data. We as-
sume that each node i of the network is associated with
a dynamical variable Xi ∈R, and that the dynamical
state of the entire network is encoded in the state vector
X = (X1, X2 . . . , XN)T . The topology of the structural
network is encoded in the graph Laplacian matrix L with
elements
Lij =
(
−aijJ
if i ̸= j,
P
j aijJ
if i = j,
(1)
where A = (aij) is the adjacency matrix of the net-
work, and J > 0 is a coupling constant. In the absence
of triadic interactions, we assume that the dynamics of
the network is associated with a Gaussian process imple-
mented as the Langevin equation
dX = −δH
δX + Γη(t)
(2)
associated with the Hamiltonian
H = 1
2X⊤(L + αI)X,
(3)
where Γ > 0, α > 0, and η(t) indicates an uncorrelated
Gaussian noise with
⟨ηi(t)ηj(t′)⟩= δijδ(t −t′).
(4)
The resulting Langevin dynamics is given by
dX = −(L + αI)Xdt + Γdη(t).
(5)
We remark that the Hamiltonian H has a minimum for
X = 0, and its depth increases as the value of α in-
creases. In a deterministic version of the model (Γ = 0),
the effect of the structural interactions will not be re-
vealed at stationarity. However, the Langevin dynam-
ics with Γ > 0 encodes for the topology on the net-
work.
Indeed, at stationarity the correlation matrix
Cij = E((Xi −E(Xi))(Xj −E(Xj))) is given by
Cij = Γ2
2 [L + αI]−1
ij .
(6)
In other words from the correlation matrix between the
dynamical variable it is possible to infer the Laplacian,
and hence the connectivity of the network. We now in-
troduce triadic interactions in the model. As explained
earlier, triadic interactions occur when one or more nodes
modulate the structural interactions between another
two nodes. To incorporate triadic interactions into the
network dynamics, we modify the definition of the Lapla-
cian operator present in the Langevin equation. Namely,
we consider the Langevin dynamics
dX = −(L(T) + αI)Xdt + Γdη(t),
(7)
obtained from Eq.(2) by substituting the graph Laplacian
L with the triadic Laplacian L(T) whose elements are

Moreover, we assume that the coupling constants Jij(X)
are determined by a perceptron-like model that con-
siders all the regulatory nodes of the link ℓ= [i, j]
and the sign of the regulatory interactions.
Specifi-
cally, if PN

instead PN
k=1 KℓkXk < ˆT then we set Jij = w−, with

where θ(·) is the Heaviside function (θ(x) = 1 if x ≥0
and θ(x) = 0 if x < 0). Note that, in the presence of the
triadic interactions, the stochastic differential equation
(7) is not associated with any Hamiltonian, and a sta-
tionary state of the dynamics is not guaranteed, making
this dynamical process significantly more complex than
the original Langevin dynamics in Eq.(2). This generic
model of triadic interactions is related to the recently pro-
posed model [27] to capture information propagation in
multilayer networks but does not make use of a multilayer
representation of the data. Moreover the model is signif-
icantly different from models of higher-order interactions
previously proposed in the context of consensus dynam-
ics [29, 30] or contagion dynamics [31, 32]. Indeed, in
our framework, triadic interactions between continuous
variables are not reducible to standard higher-order in-
teractions because they involve the modulation of the in-
teraction between pair of nodes. Moreover, this modula-
tion of the interaction is not dependent on the properties
of the interacting nodes and their immediate neighbours
such as in [29, 30] or in the machine learning attention
mechanism [33]. On the contrary, the modulation of the
interaction is determined by a third regulatory node or a
larger set of regulatory nodes encoded in the regulatory
network
Our model of triadic interactions, therefore, shows that
triadic interactions are higher-order interactions that
cannot be reduced to pairs of pairwise interactions. An
important problem that then arises is whether such in-
teractions can be mined (extracted) from real data. To
address this issue, we will formulate a new algorithm –
that we call the Triaction algorithm – to identify triadic
interactions from data, and we will test its performance
on the data generated from the model described above.
IV.
MINING TRIADIC INTERACTIONS
A.
The Triaction algorithm
We propose the Triaction algorithm (see Figure 2) to
mine triadic interactions among triples of nodes. To sim-
plify the notation we will use the letters X, Y, Z to indi-
cate both nodes as well as their corresponding dynamical
variables.
Given a structural edge between nodes X and Y , our
goal is to determine a confidence level for the existence of
a triadic interaction involving an edge between node X
and node Y with respect to a potential regulator node Z.
Specifically, we aim to determine whether the node Z reg-
ulates the edge between node X and node Y , given the
dynamical variables X, Y and Z associated with these
nodes. To do so, given a time series associated with node
Z, we first sort the Z-values, and define P bins in terms
of z-percentiles, chosen in such a way that each bin com-
prises the same number of data points (ranging in our
analyses from 30 to 100). We indicate with zm the quan-
tile of Z corresponding to the percentile m/P. Therefore,
each bin m indicates data in which Z ranges in the inter-
val [zm, zm+1). We indicate with µ(x|zm), µ(y|zm) and
µ(x, y|zm) the probability density of the variable X, Y
and the joint probability density of the variables X and
Y in each m-th bin.
A triadic interaction occurs when the node Z affects
the strength of the interaction between the other two
nodes X and Y . Consequently, our starting point is to
consider the mutual information between the dynamical
variables X and Y conditional to the specific value of
the dynamical variable Z. We thus consider the quantity
MIz(m) = MI(X, Y |Z = zm) defined as
MIz(m) =
Z
dx
Z
dyµ(x, y|zm) log

µ(x, y|zm)
µ(x|zm)µ(y|zm)

.
In order to estimate this quantity, we rely on non-
parametric methods based on entropy estimation from
k-nearest neighbors [34–36].
For each triple of nodes,
we visualize the mutual information MIz computed as
a function of the z-th quantiles zm and fit this function
with a decision tree comprising r splits.
In the absence of triadic interactions, we expect MIz
to be approximately constant as a function of the z-th
quantiles zm, while, in the presence of triadic interac-
tions, we expect this quantity to vary significantly as a
function of zm. The discretized conditional mutual infor-
mation CMI between X and Y conditioned on Z can be
written as
CMIX,Y ;Z =
P −1
X
m=0
p(zm)MIz(m) = ⟨MIz⟩,
(10)
where p(zm) = 1/P indicates the probability that the
Z value falls in the m-th bin. This quantity is known
to indicate important information about the interaction

Figure 2. The Triaction algorithm identifies triples of nodes X, Y , and Z involved in a putative triadic interaction, starting
from the knowledge of the structural network and the dynamical variables associated with its nodes. For each putative triple
of nodes involved in a triadic interaction (panel (a)) which belong to a network whose structure and dynamics is known (panel
(b)), we study the functional behavior of the conditional mututal information MIz (panel (c)), and assess the significance of
the observed modulations of MIz with respect to a null model (panel (d)). Given a predetermined confidence level, we can use
these statistics to identify significant triadic interactions (panel (e)). This procedure can be extended to different triples of the
network, thereby identifying the triadic interactions present in it (panel (f)).

,
where µ(x), µ(y) are the probability density functions for
X and Y and µ(x, y) is the joint probability density func-
tions of the variables X and Y . In particular, true inter-
actions between X and Y are typically associated with
both high mutual information MI and high conditional
mutual information CMI.
The conditional mutual information CMI, however, is not
sensitive to variations in MIz and does not therefore
provide the information needed to detect triadic inter-
actions. In order to overcome this limitation, we define
the following three quantities that measure how much
the mutual information between X and Y conditioned
on Z ∈[zm, zm+1) changes as zm varies. Specifically we
consider:
(1) the standard deviation Σ of MIz, defined as
Σ =
v
u
u
t
P −1
X
m=0
p(zm)[MIz(m) −⟨MIz⟩]2;
(11)
(2) the difference T between the maximum and mini-
mum value of MIz, given by
T =
max
m=0,...,P −1 |MIz(m) −⟨MIz⟩| ;
(12)
(3) the largest absolute difference Tn of MIz between
consecutive bins, i.e.
Tn =
max
m=0,...,P −2 |∆m(MIz)| ,
(13)
where
∆m(MIz) = MIz(m) −MIz(m + 1).
The quantities Σ, T, and Tn collectively measure the
strength of the triadic interaction under question and
can thus can be used to mine triadic interactions in real

5
data. In order to assess the significance of the putative
triadic interaction, we compare the observed values of
these variables to a null model obtained by shuffling the
Z values, to give N randomization of the data, i.e. we
use surrogate data for testing [37, 38]. In order to deter-
mine if the observed values are significant, we compute
the scores ΘΣ, ΘT , ΘTn given by
ΘΣ =
Σ −E(Σran)
p
E((Σran)2) −(E(Σran))2 ,
ΘT =
T −E(T ran)
p
E((T ran)2) −(E(T ran))2 ,
ΘTn =
Tn −E(T ran
n
)
p
E((T ran
n
)2) −(E(T ran
n
))2 ,
(14)
and the p-values
pΣ = P(Σran > Σ),
pT = P(T ran > T),
pTn = P(T ran
n
> Tn).
(15)
Note that since we consider N realizations of the null
model, we cannot estimate probabilities smaller than
1/N. Therefore, if in our null model we observe no value
of Σran larger than the true data Σ, we set the conserva-
tive estimate pΣ = 1/P. A similar procedure is applied
also to pT and pTn.
For each structural edge between node X and node Y
we can, of course, mine for triadic interactions involving
different regulators nodes Z. To compare predictions, we
rank these interactions from most to least likely via low-
est to the highest p-value, or alternatively from highest
to lowest Θ value and select the top k ranked triadic in-
teractions, or those above a predetermined significance
level.
As we will discuss below, the algorithm performs well
on our synthetic model. However, this algorithm focuses
exclusively on triples of nodes, and so neglects poten-
tially important network effects.
Thus, the algorithm
is expected to give better results for triples of nodes in
which Z is not significantly correlated with either X or
Y .
B.
Validation of the Triaction algorithm on the
triadic interaction model
To demonstrate the efficacy of the Triaction algorithm
we consider a single network (see Figure 4(a)) of N = 10
nodes, L = 12 edges and ˆL = 5 single triadic interactions
(each formed by a single node regulating a single edge)
on top of which we consider the triadic dynamical model
proposed in Sec. III.
Simulations of Eq. (7) on this network show a strong
dependence of MIz(m) on m for the triples of nodes in-
volved in triadic interactions, with greater significance
for smaller values of α. Figure 3 shows evidence of this
interesting dynamical behavior in the case of a positive
regulatory interaction.
The function MIz(m) is fitted
with a decision tree with two splits. In this way, three
different intervals of values of Z are identified, each cor-
responding to a distinct functional behavior of the cor-
relation functions between the variables X and Y . Note
that our analysis of the function MIz(m) also allows us
to distinguish between positive and negative regulatory
interactions. These are associated respectively by an in-
crease in MIz for larger values of zm or decrease of MIz
for larger values of zm. In the Supplementary Figures
S1-S2, we display further examples of the function MIz
for triadic triples. We observe that as the parameter Γ is
raised, the noise increases, which is reflected also in the
increased variability of the MIz functional behavior.
In order to provide an overall assessment of the perfor-
mance of Triaction in mining triadic interactions on this
network, in Figure 4(b) we display the Receiver Operat-
ing Characteristic curve (ROC curve) based on the score
ΘΣ, which we found to perform well for a wide range of
parameters. Our numerical results show a very good per-
formance for larger values of α, and smaller Γ(see Figure
4(b)). As it is apparent from the ROC curve, the Triac-
tion algorithm performs better for higher values of α and
smaller values of Γ. For any values of the parameters, we
notice that the false positives are more likely involving
short-range triples, i.e. triples in which the regulator node
Z has short (small) structural network distance with the
two nodes X and Y .
V.
DETECTING TRIADIC INTERACTIONS IN
GENE-EXPRESSION DATA
Searching for trigenic interactions in gene-expression is
a problem of major interest in biology. For instance, un-
derstanding the extent to which a modulator promotes
or silences the interplay between a transcription factor
and its target gene is crucial for deciphering gene reg-
ulation mechanisms. In order to address this question
with our method, we considered gene-expression data
from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), extracted from
the Grand Gene Regulatory Network Database [39, 40].
This dataset comprises N = 639 genes and R = 151 sam-
ples. Of course, this is for illustration and validation; the
same analysis can be made on any gene expression data
derived from human tissues, cancer, cell lines, or small
molecule drugs as well as on any other dataset arising
from different application domains such as climate data,
where triadic interactions on networked data are relevant.
Exhaustive mining of all potential triadic interactions
among each triple of nodes in the AML dataset is com-
putationally very demanding (it would require testing of
> 260M triplets). Instead, we focus on edges associated
with known biophysical interactions, as identified in the
human Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI) [39].
To do so, we considered the subgraph of the human PPI
network that contains all the genes/proteins included in

absence of triadic interactions. Panel (c) presents the decision tree for fitting the MIz functional behavior and determining

the AML gene expression data. The number of edges in
this subgraph is M = 42, 511. We further refined our
choice of candidate triples based on the pairwise infor-
mation of the PPI network. We considered two random
samples of short-range and longer-range triples formed
by P = 5000 triples each (see the Supplementary Mate-
rial for details). Here, range refers to the distance on the
structural network between the regulator node Z and the
nodes X or Y .
Here we present the results obtained by our mining al-
gorithm using ΘΣ as the significance score, P = 5 bins,
and assessed by running N = 5 × 103 realizations of the
null model. These results have strong correlations with
the results obtained with the other measures (see Sup-
plementary Figures S3-S4 for comparison).
Figure 5(a) displays the results of our algorithm for
both for short-range and longer-range triples, involving
a structural edge associated the mutual information MI
and the conditional mutual information CMI between
its two end-nodes. In the figure, each considered triple
corresponds to a point, color coded according to the
value of Σ.
Low values of Σ correlate with low val-
ues of MI and low values of CMI, while the high val-
ues of Σ are typically found for data corresponding to
higher values of MI and CMI. Figure 5(b) provides data
from two exemplar triples: the top panels present evi-
dence of a triadic interaction with high significance score
(ΘΣ = 3.02, pΣ = 0.0024), while the bottom panels
present evidence of a triadic interaction with low sig-
nificance score (ΘΣ = 0.97, pΣ = 0.84). The modula-
tion of the strength of the interactions in the top panels
is demonstrated by the significantly different conditional
distributions of gene-expression X and Y depending on
the value of the gene-expression Z. On the other hand,
in the bottom panels the conditional distributions do not
change significantly depending on the value of the gene-

the strength of the triadic interaction between gene Z and the edge between X and Y . (b) The results of the decision tree
allow us to distinguish three intervals of the value of Z in which the conditional distribution of the gene expression of X and

gene-expression triples, see the Supplementary Material.
From this analysis, we can extract a subnetwork (Fig-
ure S5(a)) formed by node triplets with a high signifi-

8
cance score, pΣ < 0.001 in this case.
Blue nodes and
edges compose the structural network, that is, the PPI
network. Structural edges are represented as black dia-
monds (factor nodes), while dashed lines illustrate triadic
interactions between a regulatory node and a structural
edge. We observe that the genes involved in the high-
est triadic interactions regulation are genes that play a
critical role in AML (Figure S5 and Table I): the HOX
family [41], PBX3 [42], and MEIS1 [43]. We also investi-
gated the triadic interactions involving a particular edge,
such as HOXB5-HOXB6 shown on Table I and Figure
S5(b). In particular, most of the top regulatory nodes
are consistent across all three measures (Σ, T, Tn).
In the gene-expression literature, previous studies have
proposed methods to detect modulation of interactions
[16].
Our algorithm goes beyond this previous studies
as it allows to detect not only strong monotonous pos-
itive and negative triadic interactions (see Supplemen-
tary Figure S6 and S7) but also strong triadic inter-
actions with non monotonous MIz functional behavior
(see Supplementary Figure S8).
The detected interac-
tions strongly depart from triples with low significance
score for which the MIz does not vary significantly (see
Supplementary Figure S9).
Such results challenge the
constraints of monotonic assumptions in existing mea-
sures within the gene expression literature. It is impor-
tant to note that, while the monotonic assumption holds
in the gene-expression context, non-monotonic behavior
is a rare occurrence. However, in broader systems, the
prevalence of mostly monotonic behavior, as observed in
gene expression, cannot be assumed. Our measures can
detect various functional behaviors, and are applicable to
any context where triadic interactions may occur.

CONCLUSIONS
Our work proposes a comprehensive information the-
ory approach to model and mine triadic interactions be-
tween continuous variables. The key observation is that
the mutual information between two variables can be sig-
nificantly modulated by a third regulatory node. Hence,
detecting triadic interactions requires going beyond pair-
wise measures such as the mutual information and the
conditional mutual information. The proposed approach
is here used to mine triadic interactions in gene expres-
sion data, and we are able to detect known triadic in-
teractions together with new candidate triplets.
Our
approach outperforms classical methods in the gene ex-
pression community, which assume that the CMI func-
tion should exhibit monotonicity with the evolution of
the conditioning node [16], and extends the method for
broader applications. These results are encouraging and
may inspire further research in the field of gene regula-
tion, particularly within the context of tissue specificity.
Investigating the extent to which triadic interactions are
tissue-specific, as well as whether certain regulatory pat-
terns are conserved across different tissues, could yield
valuable insights. In the future, the method could be ap-
plied to other type of data including times series which
can be relevant in other scientific applications, such as
climate research.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE TRIADIC MODEL WITHIN CONTINUOUS VARIABLES.
We use a network with N = 10 nodes L = 12 edges and ˆL = 5 regulatory interactions (shown in Figure 3 of the main
text). We consider the time series obtained by integrating the stochastic dynamics of the proposed dynamical model
for triadic interactions within continuous variables. The time series is simulated up to a maximum time tmax = 4000
with a dt = 10−2 leading to 4 × 105 data points. For our analysis we consider the last 200, 000 data points sampled
every fifth point leading to 40, 000 time steps. In Figure 2 of the main text we report the analysis done for the
triplet [4,9,5], which is triadic. For this figure the parameters of the model are: α = 0.05, ˆT = 10−3, Γ = 10−2,
w+ = 8, w−= 0.5, number of bins P = 400. In the Supplemental Figures S1 and S2 we report the analysis conducted
on the same triadic triple of nodes for different parameter values: for Figure S1 we have α = 0.01, Γ = 10−2, for
Figure S2 we have α = 0.05, Γ = 5 × 10−2. The other parameter values are the same as in Figure 2 of the main text.
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON ANALYSIS OF GENE-EXPRESSION DATASET
Triplet selection
We choose two sub-samples of 5000 triples of triadic interactions from the gene-expression associated with Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML) dataset for our Triaction analyses. The selection process for these sub-samples is motivated
by studies indicating that for gene expression data, most of the genes involved in trigenic processes are also involved
in digenic processes [1]. Hence, we utilize the Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI) associated with AML, which
captures digenic processes, to choose edges forming the triplets in our study. The selection of the regulatory node aims
to encompass both short-range and longer-range interactions. To differentiate between these cases, we employ the
shortest path distance in the PPI. The first sub-sample comprises short-range motifs, including the fully connected
triangle and the partially connected triangle (see Figure S3(a)).
We conduct a similar analysis for longer-range
interactions. Figure S3(a) illustrates the distribution of the proportion of triplets categorized by the length of the
shortest path between node Z and the edge composed of nodes X and Y. This path length can be expressed as
min (dXZ, dY Z), where dXZ denotes the shortest path length between nodes X and Z, and dY Z indicates the shortest
path length between nodes Y and Z.
Comparison between short-range and longer range triples in AML dataset
Based on the structural network, specifically the Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI), we distinguish in-
teractions into short-range (depicted in blue) and longer-range (depicted in red).
Longer-range interactions are
characterised by a minimum shortest path between structural edges and the regulatory node candidate of at least
2. S3(b) display the probability density function estimated by Gaussian kernels on the histogram of the probability
distribution of the score Θ for the three measures: Σ, T, and Tn. Curves in varying shades of blue represent short-
range interactions, while those in shades of red represent longer-range interactions. Notably, significant Θ scores are
predominantly associated with short-range interactions. S3(e-f) showcase correlations between Θ scores for the three
measures. There is a strong correlation between ΘΣ and ΘT (S3(e)), these correlation is observed both for short-
and long-range interactions. The correlation is also observed between ΘΣ and ΘTn ((S3(f))). S3(c-d) display mutual
information between nodes (X and Y ) involved in structural edges, as well as mutual information between X and

cant triplets, particularly for short-range interactions, necessitate high mutual information and conditional mutual
information.
However, for longer-range interactions, conditional mutual information must be higher that mutual
information.
Comparison between the results obtained with different measures
In Figure S4 we display the results obtained on the gene-expression AML data by performing an analysis conducted
using the T and the Tn measures. We observe that these results correlate with the results obtained using the Σ

Supplemental figure and table of detected triadic interactions in AML dataset
We detected 32 triadic interactions with a pΣ < 0.001, listed in Table S1.
In the Table, we report Σ, T, Tn
ΘΣ, ΘT , ΘTn and the p-values pΣ, pT , pTn associated with each triadic interaction of the network displayed in Figure
S5. We observe that the genes involved in the highest triadic interactions regulation are genes to play a critical role
in AML (Figure 6), the HOX family [2], PBX3 [3], and MEIS1 [4]. Moreover, a recent study shows that HOXA5 is
a regulation hub for AML patients [5] which can also be observed in Figure 6. Furthermore, known triple have been
detected with a lower p-value threshold like (HOXA9, PBX3, MEIS1, pΣ = 0.06) which are known to cooperate all
together in AML patients [6, 7].

Supplemental Figures on gene-expression results
In Figure S6-S9 we display exemplary results obtained by applying the Triaction algorithm on the AML dataset.
Figure S6 provides an example of high-significant positive triadic interaction. Figure S6 provides an example of
high-significant negative triadic interactions. Figure S8 provides an example of triadic interactions displaying a non-
monotonous MIz functional behavior. Figure S9 provides an example of triple with low significance score for triadic
interactions with a almost flat MIz profile.
TRIACTION PYTHON PACKAGE
The Triaction algorithm here proposed is implemented by a Python package, called Triaction, that we have developed
for detecting triadic interations within continuous and discrete variables. The Triaction package allows to work with
both data-frames and data sets associated with a pairwise network. From this initial data, the package provides
various ways to extract relevant features and detect triadic interactions. We have included several representations
and visualisations in the package to aid in the interpretation of the results. The code is available on GitHub at the
following link: https://github.com/anthbapt/triaction. Additionally, we offer documentation to guide users through
the analysis process.

FIG. S5: (a) Visualization of the AML network with triadic interactions mined by the Triaction algorithm including the 32
detected triadic interactions with pΣ < 10−3 (see Supplementary Table for the list of such interactions).
Blue nodes and
edges compose the structural network, which is a subgraph of the Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI). Factor nodes are
depicted as black diamonds, while dashed lines (green for positive and red for negative) illustrate regulatory triadic interactions.
(b) We consider all the putative triadic interactions involving the structural network edge HOXB5-HOXB6 and any possible
regulatory node. The obtained values of ΘΣ, ΘT , and ΘT n, are plotted against their rank. The nodes associated with the
six highest ranked Θ scores are indicated in the insets. Across all three measures (Σ, T, and Tn), the top triadic interaction
involves MEIS1 as the regulatory node (depicted in a golden frame inset). The second highest regulatory node for the HOXB5-
HOXB6 edge is ETS2 for the Σ and T measures, and THRA for the Tn measure (illustrated in a silver frame inset). Notably,
THRA also ranks highly for the Σ measure (ranked 5) and the T measure (ranked 4). The third highest regulatory node for
the HOXB5-HOXB6 edge is HOXA3 for both the Σ and T measures, and FOSL1 for the Tn measure (highlighted in a bronze
frame-inset).
