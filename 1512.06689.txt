etrocausal models of QM add further weight
to the conﬂict between causality and the pos-
sible existence of free will. We analyze a sim-
ple closed causal loop ensuing from the interaction
between two systems with opposing thermodynamic
time arrows, such that each system can forecast “fu-
ture” events for the other. The loop is avoided by the
fact that the choice to abort an event thus forecasted
leads to the destruction of the forecaster’s past. Phys-
ical law therefore enables prophecy of future events
only as long as this prophecy is not revealed to a free
agent who can otherwise render it false. This reso-
lution is demonstrated on an earlier ﬁnding derived
from the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF), where
a weak measurement’s outcome anticipates a future
choice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only
after the choice has been actually made. To quan-
tify this assertion, “weak information” is described in
terms of Fisher information. We conclude that an “al-
ready existing” future does not exclude free will nor
invoke causal paradoxes. On the quantum level, par-
ticles can be thought of as weakly interacting accord-
ing to their past and future states, but causality re-
mains intact as long as the future is masked by quan-
tum indeterminism.

1 Introduction
Time-symmetric formulations of QM are gaining growing
interest. Using two boundary conditions rather than the
customary one, they oﬀer novel twists to several foun-
dational issues. Such are the Wheeler-Feynman electro-
magnetic absorber theory [1], and Hoyle and Narlikar’s
modiﬁcation [2] and Cramer’s transactional interpreta-
tion [3]. Among these, however, the ABL rule [4] and
Aharonov’s Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF) [5] are
distinct, in that they even predict some novel eﬀects for a
combination of forwards and backwards evolving wave
functions. When performing a complete post-selection
of the quantum state, otherwise counterfactual questions
can be intriguingly answered with regard to the state’s
previous time evolution.
These advances, however, might seem come with a
price that even for adherents is too heavy, namely, dis-
missing free will. While quantum indeterminism seemed
to oﬀer some liberation from the chains imposed on our
choices by classical causality, time-symmetric QM some-

what undermines quantum indeterminism, as it renders
future boundary conditions the missing source of possible
causes. This might eventually reveal causality to be just
as strict and closed as classical causality. If the future
is, in some sense, “already there” to the point of being
causally equal to the past, free will (which is deﬁned
in the next section) might appear to be as illusory as it
has appeared within the classical framework. We aim to
show this is not necessarily the case. TSVF is no worse
oﬀthan classical physics, or other formulations of quan-
tum mechanics as it pertains to the incorporation of free
will. In other words, free will is not precluded even when
discussing a quantum world having both past and future
boundary.
In this special issue of Quanta, dedicated to Richard
Feynman and discussing time-symmetry in quantum me-
chanics, we examine what might seem to be a problem in
these formulations, namely the notion of free will [6]. Dis-
cussion of this kind might at ﬁrst be regarded as philosoph-
ical in character, but we hope to formulate the problem
rigorously enough to yield nontrivial physical insights.
2 The Problem
Following Russell and Deery [6], we propose deﬁning
free will as follows. Let a physical system be capable of
initiating complex interactions with its environment, gain-
ing information about it and predicting its future states, as
well as their eﬀects on the system itself. This grants the
system purposeful behavior, which nevertheless fully ac-
cords with classical causality. Now let there be more than
one course of action that the system can take in response
to a certain event, which in turn lead to diﬀerent future
outcomes that the system can predict. “Free will” then
denotes the system’s taking one out of various courses
of action, independently (at least to some extent) of past
restrictions. This deﬁnition is very close in spirit to the
one employed in [7], i.e. the ability to make choices. It
should be emphasized that even in our time-symmetric
context, free will means only freedom from the past, not
from the future (see also [5]).
In classical physics, conservation laws oblige any event
to be strictly determined by earlier causes. In our con-
text, this might apparently leave only one course of action
for the system in question, and hence no real choices.
When moving to the quantum realm, free will might be
recovered [7], but then again, if one adds a ﬁnal boundary
condition to the description of the quantum system, can
free will exist? We shall answer both classical and quan-
tum questions on the aﬃrmative, employing statistical
and quantum ﬂuctuations, respectively.
In what follows, we analyze a classical causal paradox
avoided by the past’s instability. We subsequently con-
sider a more acute variant of this paradox and discuss
a few possible resolutions. Then we present the quan-
tum counterpart of these two paradoxes where inherent
indeterminism saves causality. We show that within the
TSVF, although both future and past states of the system
are known, genuine freedom is not necessarily excluded.
We then deﬁne and quantify the term “weak information”
– the kind of information coming from the future that can
be encrypted in the past without violating causality.
3 An Interaction between Two
Systems with Opposing
Time-Arrows
To demonstrate the possibility of knowing one’s future
and its consequences, we discuss a highly simpliﬁed clas-
sical gedanken experiment. Naturally, there are immedi-
ate diﬃculties with such a setup. Can, e.g., two regions in
space have opposite time arrows to begin with? Can ob-
servers inside them communicate? etc. These questions
deserve further probing, but we focus here only on what
would happen if several conditions are met, rather than
whether and how they can be achieved.
Consider, then, a universe comprised of only two
closed, non-interacting laboratories located at some dis-
tance from one another. Suppose further that their ther-
modynamic time arrows are opposite to one another, such
that each system’s “future” time direction is the other’s
“past”. Finally let each laboratory host a free agent, hence-
forth Alice and Bob, capable of free choice.
It is challenging to create a communication channel
between two laboratories of this kind. An exchange of
signals is possible in the following form. A light beam is
sent from the exterior part of one laboratory to the other’s
boundary, where a static message is posted. The beam is
then reﬂected back to its origin. If the labs are massive
enough, the beam imparts only a negligible momentum
transfer.
The gedanken experiment is as follows (see Fig. 1):
t(b)
1 : Bob sends a light-beam (red arrow) to Alice’s lab.
t(b)
2 : He receives through his returning beam a message
from Alice saying: “Let me know if you see this message”
(dotted blue world-line).
t(b)
3 : Bob posts a conﬁrmation saying: “I saw your
message”(red world-line).
Then there are the following events in Alice’s lab:
t(a)
1 : Alice sends a light-beam (blue arrow) to Bob’s
lab.
t(a)
2 : Alice receives through her returning beam of par-
ticles that scattered oﬀBob’s message, i.e. she gets the

with free agents.
information from Bob through this beam reﬂected from
Bob’s system to her system.
t(a)
3 : Alice, realizing that this conﬁrmation comes from
her future, chooses not to post a message.
The Causal Paradox is obvious: The dotted blue world-
line represents an absent message. How, then, could Bob
reply to a message which was removed before he was
supposed to see it?
It should be noted, that alongside with this formula-
tion of the paradox, one can equivalently describe the
complementary scenario: Bob ﬁnds through his return-
ing beam that Alice did not post a message. Therefore,
he sends no conﬁrmation, but eventually Alice, having
free will, decides to post a message in contrast to Bob’s
observation.
4 The Suggested Resolution
A key element in this causal paradox’s resolution is the
following well-known fact: Entropy-increasing processes
are highly stable, not sensitive to small changes in their
initial conditions or their evolution, whereas entropy-
decreasing processes are extremely vulnerable to any
interference.
Our question therefore is: Which time direction is
aﬀected by Alice’s decision to change the “future”that
“has been forecasted” by Bob? The simplest and most
consistent answer is: Bob’s past. Upon Alice’s decision
to remove her message at t(a)3, Bob’s “prophecy”, i.e. the
message of Bob to Alice regarding her future choice, turns
out to be false. This is clearly inconsistent with his earlier
observation of Alice’s message, which is understood now
to be highly unstable. His observation turns out to be a
large (hence very rare) statistical ﬂuctuation.
We can now deﬁne the arrow of time of any system
as the thermodynamic direction which is stable against
changes. While a small change at the large system’s
present will negligibly aﬀect its future, it can have dra-
matic eﬀects into its past. Alice’s future was coupled in
our example to Bob’s past. By employing her free will,
she could completely alter his previous observations, but
the apparent paradox is resolved by taking into account
the chaotic nature of the entropy decreasing direction.
Indeed, the signals are weak enough, which makes them
amenable for this reinterpretation as ﬂuctuations.
5 A More Acute Paradox
We shall now discuss an operationally simpler, yet con-
ceptually harder version of the paradox, which empha-
sizes the role of free will. Let the two labs with opposing
time arrows contain two simple machines rather than free
agents (see Fig. 2). One machine, A, posts 0 if it receives
0 as an input, and 1 if it receives 1. The second lab’s
machine, B, posts 1 if it receives 0 and 0 if it receives 1.
The paradox is as follows: In case A receives 0 from the
other lab, it posts 0. Then B receives the 0 as an input and
posts 1, in contrast to A’s earlier input. Alternatively, A
receives 1 from B, then posts 1. Then, B receives this 1
and posts 0, again in contrast to the A’s initial input.
It follows there are no valid initial conditions for this
combined system at a given time.
The resolution may be:
(1) Communication is impossible between two such sys-
tems.
(2) The past of both systems is symmetrically unstable.
(3) There must be some stochastic element allowing con-
sistency.
(4) The operations of the two machines must be coordi-
nated.
As explained above, we assume that communication of
simple static messages is possible, hence we shall avoid
the ﬁrst option (nevertheless, this paradox could actually
suggest that a special communication protocol is needed
between two such systems with opposite time arrows).
Options (2) and (3) complement each other and resonate
with the above notion of free will, as well as with the
quantum paradox to be presented below. Naturally, this
combination is favored by us. We believe this paradoxical

to reside on the B side.
situation could have been avoided if a minor degree of
freedom (e.g. at the form of free will) were allowed. In
contrast, alternative (4) implies superdeterminism (see
for instance [8,9]) or the so called “conspiracy” between
the two machines, which is philosophically disturbing (at
least in our view), negating free will altogether.
6 Going Quantum: The TSVF and
Weak Measurements
The possibility for resolving the above problem on classi-
cal grounds encourages seeking more interesting avenues
at the quantum level. Indeed a similar resolution will
be oﬀered, i.e. the possibility of re-interpreting the past.
However, the basic concept on which the resolution re-
lies shifts from thermodynamic to quantum ﬂuctuations
which are more suitable for describing small microscopic
systems. This is where time-symmetric quantum causality
comes in most naturally.
TSVF is a time-symmetric formulation of quantum me-
chanics employing in addition to the forward evolving
wave function (pre-selected state) also a backwards evolv-
ing wave function (post-selected state). This combination
gives rise to the two-state-vector, which provides a richer
notion of quantum reality between two projective mea-
surements. This world-view has produced several predic-
tions, so far well veriﬁed by weak measurements [10–13]
which delicately gather information about the quantum
state without collapsing it, and thus do not change to
post-selection probability.
In an earlier work [13] the following gedanken experi-
ment was proposed. A large ensemble of N EPR spins is
prepared. Each particle in every pair is weakly measured
along the three Bell orientations, before being strongly
projected along one of them. As was shown, each weak
measurement only slightly disturbs the state and hence
the well-known non-local correlations between the strong
outcomes are maintained in this experiment. It should be
noted that in return each weak measurement provides only
a negligible amount of information (to be quantiﬁed in
the next Section). However, since all the weak outcomes
were classically recorded, upon slicing them according
to the projective outcomes, one ﬁnds in retrospect, with
extreme accuracy, the weak values corresponding to all
Bell orientations (not only the ones eventually chosen
for the projective measurement). The question is then,
how could the values reside in the weak data prior to the
ﬁnal Bell measurements which demonstrated almost per-
fect non-local correlations? Bell’s proof certainly forbids
them to be prepared in such a way so the TSVF answer
would be they came from the future! The important point
in this retrocausal interpretation is the weak values could
be there, that is, could had causal eﬀect on the pointer’s
shift, without forcing a speciﬁc future outcome.
The resolution is therefore simple: Quantum indeter-
minacy guarantees that, should someone try to abort a
future event about which they have received a prophecy,
that prophecy would turn out to be a mere error.
Therefore, even in the TSVF where present is deter-
mined by both past and future events, the quantum inde-
terminism enables free will.
Naturally, more mundane explanations ought to be
considered before concluding that results of weak mea-
surement contain information regarding a future event.
By normal causality, it should be Alice’s measurements
which aﬀected Bob’s, rather than vice versa. Perhaps, for
example, some subtle bias induced by her weak measure-
ments aﬀected his later strong ones.
Such a “past-to-future” eﬀect is considerably strained
by the following question: How robust is the alleged
bias introduced by the weak measurements? If it is ro-
bust enough to oblige the strong measurements, then it is
equivalent to full collapse, namely the very local hidden
variables already ruled out by Bell’s inequality. This is
clearly not the case: weakly measured particles remain
nearly fully entangled. But then, even the weakest bias, as
long as it is expected to show up over a suﬃciently large
N, is ruled out of the same grounds. The “weak bias”
alternative is ruled out also by the robust correlations
predicted between all same-spin measurements, whether
weak or strong.
Can Alice predict Bob’s outcomes on the basis of her
own data? To do that, she must feed all her rows of out-
comes into a computer that searches for a possible series
of spin-orientation choices plus measurement outcomes,
such that, when she slices her rows accordingly, she will
get the complex pattern of correlations described above.
The number of such possible sequences that she gets
from her computation is
 
N
N/2
!
∝
2N
√
N . Each such se-
quence enables her to slice each of her rows into two N/2
halves and get the above correlations between her weak
measurements and the predicted strong measurements.

Notice that, according to Sec. 5, the results’ distribu-
tion is a Gaussian with λ
√
N/2 expectation and δ
√
N/2
standard deviation, so a δ shift in one of the results, or
even in
√
N of them, is very probable. Hence, even if
Alice computes all Bob’s possible future choices, she
still cannot tell which choice he will take, because there
are many similar subsets giving roughly the same value.
Also, as Aharonov et al. pointed out in [13], when Al-
ice ﬁnds a subset with a signiﬁcant deviation from the
expected 50%-50% distribution, its origin is much more
likely, upon a real measurement by Bob, to turn out to
be a measurement error than a genuine physical value.
Obviously, then, present data is insuﬃcient to predict the
future choice.
7 The “strength” of Information
Transmission
The information transmission between Alice and Bob
can be categorized into two diﬀerent types with diﬀerent
“strength”:
1. Strong information: This type describes the infor-
mation that, in general, has the potential to interfere with
Alice’s free choice. This is the classical kind of informa-
tion transmitted in the ﬁrst gedanken experiment.
2.Weak information: In this case the information that
Bob sends to Alice will not, in any circumstance, interfere
with Alice’s free choice because it is buried much below
the quantum uncertainty level.
While the strong information transmission was dis-
cussed in Secs. 3-4 and was shown to cast instability into
Bob’s past, it seems the weak information notion should
be further explained and quantiﬁed.
We now understand that weak information represents
information that does not actively interfere with the Al-
ice’s and Bob’s systems. Therefore, weak information
can be described employing weak measurement outcomes
since individually they only provide very partial infor-
mation that does not interfere neither Alice’s nor Bob’s
system consistency. Similarly, strong information is re-
lated to projective measurement outcomes since they do
disturb the systems and provide deﬁnite results.
To create a clear distinction between the two kinds of
information, we shall discuss a simple thought experi-
ment. Suppose Alice has a spin she wants to measure.
To do that, she will use a Stern-Gerlach magnet with a
non-homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld along some direction.
Bob, having an opposite time arrow, already knows that
Alice will choose the z-axis and and will ﬁnd an “up”
outcome. If Bob sends this (strong) information to Al-
ice, she may choose the y-axis instead and ﬁnd a “down”
outcome, reproducing the paradoxical situation discussed
above. However, if Bob only tells her she will ﬁnd an
“up” result along some direction, no causal paradox will
ensue (see also [14]. This is the kind of weak information
which does not clash with Alice’s free will nor with Bob’s
history.
8 Fisher Information for Strong and
Weak measurements
Fisher information is a tool to quantify the hidden infor-
mation in a random variable Q regarding a parameter it
depends on. Using Fisher information we can now quanti-
tatively deﬁne the strong and weak information concepts
that were qualitatively introduced in the Section above.
Suppose there is an unknown parameter θ which we
want to estimate (θ can stand for, e.g., the relative phase
between two superposed wave-packets). We deﬁne a den-
sity function of Q by f, and another auxiliary parameter ∆
which describes the type of information, strong or weak.
In probabilistic terms, it is called the “scale parameter”
of Q. In this case, Fisher information as a function of ∆,
I∆(θ), is given by
I∆(θ) := E

" ∂
∂θ ln f (∆Q; θ)
#2
|θ
.
(1)
It can be easily shown that I∆(θ) is in fact the product of
∆−1 and I(θ):
I∆(θ)
=
Z " ∂
∂θ ln f (∆Q; θ)

f (∆Q; θ) dQ
(2)
=

∆
Z " ∂
∂θ ln f (Q; θ)
#2
f (Q; θ) dQ
(3)
=
∆−1I(θ).
(4)
Now, in case of ∆→0, we ﬁnd
lim
∆→0I∆(θ) = lim
∆→0∆−1I(θ) = ∞,
(5)
hence we conclude that ∆→0 indicates strong informa-
tion.
The opposite case of ∆→∞leads to
lim
∆→∞I∆(θ) = lim
∆→∞∆−1I(θ) = 0,
(6)
which implies weak information, so for suﬃcient large
value of ∆, weak information is described by a negligible
Fisher information.
Let us now demonstrate this concept. Suppose that
θ is the relative phase between two superposed wave-
packets, which we want to measure in some interference
experiment. Let us assume that the interference pattern is
detected via some coupling 1/∆to a measuring pointer.

Gaussian random variable Q, then the density function
of Q will be f(Q; θ) =

. Depending
on the coupling strength, the Fisher information will be
I∆(θ) = ∆−1θ−2.
9 Cryptography Can Protect
Causality
Weak or encrypted information can be used for communi-
cation between future and past in a causality preserving
manner thanks to quantum indeterminism. The main idea
behind this type of communication is quantum cryptogra-
phy [15]. Suppose Bob somehow knows what Alice will
choose in the future. He uses a quantum cryptography
scheme to encode Alice’s future choice and gives her the
encrypted prophecy. However, he does not share with her
the key to decode this revelation until she actually makes
her choice. In this case, similarly to the example in Sec.
6, both Bob’s past and Alice’s future are secured. Due to
quantum indeterminism, Alice still has free will.
For example, in the BB84 scheme [16], even though
Alice and Bob communicate through a public channel,
their secret key is secured due to another form of quantum
indeterminism, namely, that non-orthogonal states are
indistinguishable. This means that even if the generated
string contains information regarding Eve’s future, it will
not create a causal paradox.
10 A Few alternatives
In addition to the proposed resolution for the above para-
doxes, there exist some other well-known possibilities.
The parallel universe resolution suggests that if one goes
back in time and kills his grandfather he actually does it
in a parallel universe and therefore he does not interfere
with the laws of nature [17, 18]. A diﬀerent approach
to solve this is by postulating another time dimension
in which such disagreements can be solved before being
recorded in our history [19,20].
These two resolutions clearly lack simplicity and oblige
an excessive ontology to our existing theories. Moreover,
detailed work is needed to refute each and every paradox.
Therefore, bearing in mind Occam’s razor as a tool
for denying complex theories, it seems these alternative
solutions are unfavorable.
Another solution simply dictates that one cannot cre-
ate paradoxes in the universe and therefore cannot, for
instance, kill his grandfather. This approach implies a
universe guided by global consistency condition such
as in [21, 22] and was shown to naturally arise in post-
selected closed-timelike curves [23].
11 Free will and Becoming
Classical physics treats time as a purely geometrical in-
gredient of the universe, alongside the three spatial dimen-
sions. Against the perfect logical rigor and experimental
support that make relativity so powerful, many physicists
ﬁnd the “block universe” picture emerging from it man-
ifestly awkward. In fact, the very notion of space-time
implies that, just as all locations have the same degree
of reality in space, so do all past, present, and future mo-
ments exist along the temporal dimension without any
moment being unique as the privileged “now ”.
Against this mainstream view, there are alternative ac-
counts [24]. They suspect that, if we experience time
so diﬀerently from space, this diﬀerence may be objec-
tive. They provide some models to capture this notion of
dynamic time.
Bob’s access to Alice’s future in the classical gedanken
experiment above and the double boundary condition on
the wave function proposed by the TSVF may seem at
ﬁrst sight to resonate with a block universe approach.
However, as we have just seen, statistical and quantum
ﬂuctuations may provide us with freedom to deﬁne the
present. As was shown in Secs. 4-5, this freedom, and
also the notion of becoming, is subjective and system-
dependent.
Within the TSVF, while both backward and forward
states evolve deterministically, they have limited physical
signiﬁcance on their own — physical reality is created
by the product of the causal chains extending in both
temporal directions. The past does not determine the fu-
ture,yet the future is set, and only together do they form
the present. However, the existence of a future boundary
condition,and its deterministic eﬀect, do not deny our
freedom of choice. It is allowed due to the inaccessibility
of the data (which is a requirement of causality, as dis-
cussed in Sec. 5). Examining the concept of free will
from a physical point of view,we ﬁnd it must contain at
least partial freedom from past causal constraints, and
such freedom is duly manifested in the TSVF, where a
juxtaposition of freedom and determinacy is epitomized.
12 Conclusions
We examined the possibility of free will in a retrocausal
theory. Closed causal loops, which arise due to the inter-
action between two systems with opposing time arrows
were discussed. The suggested resolution of the ensuing
Quanta | DOI: 10.12743/quanta.xxx
Month 2014 | Volume X | Issue Y | Page 6

paradoxes relies on the thermodynamic instability of the
past.
Moving to the quantum realm, a similar paradox can
be solved via the quantum indeterminism, which is under-
stood to protect free will. This resonates with previous
ﬁndings of Georgiev [7]. Furthermore, we discussed the
“strength” of information transmission, where the terms
“strong” and “weak” are related to strong (projective) and
weak values, respectively. When information about a
future event is buried under quantum indeterminism it
cannot violate free will. Similarly, encrypted information,
e.g., the one available through weak measurements, does
not violate causality. The existence of free will in these
time symmetric models was conjectured to resonate with
a dynamical notion of time.
