Quadrupole
An electric quadrupole is an array of four charges with no net charge or
electric dipole moment; see multipole. A quadrupole moment, with
components Qij, is defined as

r(r)dt
where r(r) is the electron density. (Be aware that some sources use a
slightly diﬀerent definition.) A nucleus with I41/2 has a nuclear
quadrupole moment due to a nonspherical distribution of charge over
its surface. Electric quadrupole moments interact with the electric
field gradient, rE, not the electric field itself.
Quantization
The quantization of a property, primarily energy and angular mo-
mentum, is its confinement to a discrete but possibly infinite set of
values. Quantization is a consequence of the application of
boundary conditions to solutions of the Schrödinger equation and
criteria related to the acceptability of wavefunctions. The term space
quantization is sometimes applied to the quantization of the com-
ponent of angular momentum on an arbitrary axis, because in the
vector model the vector representing the angular momentum is

depicted as adopting only certain discrete orientations with respect
to that axis.
Quantum Mechanics
The description of the properties of matter and radiation known as
quantum mechanics is based on the following postulates:
1. The dynamical state of a system is fully described by a wave-
function, c(r,t).
2. Observables, O, are represented by linear Hermitian operators, bO,
chosen to satisfy certain commutation relations.
3. When a system is described by a wavefunction c(r,t), the mean
value of the observable O is the expectation value of bO.
4. If the wavefunction is an eigenfunction of bO with eigenvalue o,
then the result of a measurement of O will be o. If the wave-
function is not an eigenfunction of bO, then any measurement
will give one of its eigenvalues and the probability that the
eigenvalue oi will be obtained is proportional to the square
modulus of the linear combination coeﬃcient ci in the expan-
sion c ¼

cici.
In typical applications of quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger
equation is set up for the system of interest and then solved either
analytically or numerically, subject to the boundary conditions for the
system of interest. Some dynamical properties can be inferred from
the operators alone (angular momentum especially).
Quantum Number
A quantum number is a number used to label the state of a system and
in many cases to assess the value of a dynamical variable. Quantum
numbers are either integers or, for properties relating to the intrinsic
angular momenta (spin) half-integers. In at least one case, a particle
confined to an equilateral triangular surface, the quantum numbers
are one-third integers. Some typical quantum numbers, their values,
and their significance are listed in Table Q.1.

Quantum Yield
In photochemistry, the primary quantum yield, f, is the number of
specified primary products for each photon absorbed. The overall
quantum yield, F, is the number of reactant molecules that generated
for each proton absorbed.
Quenching
A chemical reaction is quenched if the conditions are suddenly
changed and it ceases to generate products. Quenching may be
achieved by lowering the temperature, diluting the system, or adding
a new reagent.
