Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human
preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned
the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-
called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is
more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover
that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can
directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting.
We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference
(RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the
evaluation results to guide backward rewind and forward generation for AI safety.
Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and
abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates; during the
self-evaluation phase, the model receives guidance on which human preference
to align with through a fixed-template prompt, eliminating the need to modify the
initial prompt. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate
the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness
rate of LLaMA 30B over vanilla inference from 82% to 97%, while maintaining
the helpfulness rate. Under the leading adversarial attack LLM-ATTACKS on Vicuna
33B, RAIN establishes a new defense baseline by reducing the attack success rate
from 94% to 19%.

Introduction
Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to address human queries,
aid in coding tasks, and more. Nonetheless, the generated outputs of these models can sometimes
diverge from preferred human values and even pose potential risks. To make pre-trained LLMs more
user-friendly and safe, numerous alignment methods have been proposed, such as RLHF (Casper
et al., 2023), RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b), RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023), RAFT (Dong et al., 2023), and
DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). These methods, however, necessitate the finetuning of pre-trained
LLMs and demand considerable amounts of meticulously human-annotated data and computational
resources. Take RLHF as an example, this comprehensive approach encompasses three primary
phases: supervised finetuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL),
together with the necessity to manage four separate models—policy, value, reward, and reference
models—each of which has at least billions of parameters. Efficiently operating these models requires
significant GPU memory, and the act of updating their parameters poses a threat of overwriting the
knowledge retained from the initial pre-training. Additionally, it is worth noting that training larger
models is often met with heightened instability and requires significant engineering expertise. Hence,
aligning frozen LLMs presents a more appealing option to the majority.
This work shows that fixed LLMs are alignable using a novel inference method without finetuning. To
justify the feasibility, our inspiration stems from the concept of superficial alignment hypothesis (Zhou
et al., 2023): a model’s knowledge and capabilities are learnt almost entirely during pre-training,
while alignment teaches it which sub-distribution of formats should be used. Logically, the action of
“selecting a sub-distribution” should not mandate modifications to model parameters. Reject sampling
is a working example of inference-time alignment. However, the method is sample-inefficient as
tested by experiments.
The problem of LLM alignment becomes more challenging when we require the model to be aligned
by itself without external supervision, the so-called self-alignment. Although LLMs often generate
responses that do not align with human values, LLMs are “aware” that their outputs are inappropriate,
as evidenced in RLAIF. Studies such as RLAIF and Self-Alignment (Sun et al., 2023) capitalize
on this by employing pre-trained LLMs to annotate or generate data, followed by finetuning. Our
findings suggest that the self-annotation and finetuning process, often utilized in these works, is
capable of being omitted. By integrating evaluation and the rewind mechanism, frozen LLMs can
directly generate responses that are consistent with human values.
To this end, in the model’s inference phase we implement a self-evaluation strategy to appraise the
generated text. Guided by these evaluation outcomes, we enact a rewindable process that facilitates
retracing steps. Our inference method—Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN)—mirrors
human behavioral patterns: contemplating, weighing, and reflecting on the consequences before
speaking. The conceptual framework of RAIN is depicted in Figure 1. Empirical findings underscore
the capacity of our method to elevate language model performance, all achieved without the need for
parameter updates or reliance on human-annotated data. For example, on the Anthropic’s Helpfulness
and Harmlessness (HH) dataset (see Figure 2), RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B
by 15% over the vanilla auto-regressive inference, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. In contrast,
naïvely cherry picking re-generations of vanilla inference results in significantly lower efficiency (see
Table 3).
Compared with existing LLM (self-)alignment techniques, the advantages of RAIN include:
• RAIN exhibits universality, showcasing its potential for application in various language
generation tasks. This user-friendly approach seamlessly integrates itself into the framework
of auto-regressive inference, making it easily incorporable into most existing LLMs.
• RAIN is proficient at aligning LLMs in which the weights are frozen. Unlike RLHF, RAIN
eliminates the need for maintaining additional models and avoids storing gradient infor-
mation and computational graphs. Consequently, the memory overhead aligns with that of
vanilla auto-regressive inference, underscoring its memory-efficient and easy-implemented
nature.
• As RAIN is learning-free, there is no reliance on human annotations or any form of labeled
or unlabeled data. Our experiments attest that RAIN significantly enhances performance
across various alignment tasks and improves LLM robustness against adversarial prompt
attacks: under the leading adversarial attack of Zou et al. (2023) that produces jailbreaking

attack success rate from 94% to 19%.
Beyond performance, we emphasize that our primary goal is to investigate the feasibility of enabling
(self-)alignment in fixed LLMs without engaging in resource-intensive finetuning or reinforcement
learning procedures. Our findings demonstrate that the model’s capacity for alignment is entirely
self-contained, requiring no external sources of knowledge and data. The approach can be seamlessly
implemented as a plug-in, which can conveniently integrate with existing auto-regressive models.

Related Work
Alignment with reinforcement learning. Utilizing reinforcement learning to align language models
with human preferences was initially applied for tasks like text summarization and translation
(Stiennon et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Kreutzer et al., 2018; Cho et al., 2018; Ziegler et al.,
2019). Now, the technique is predominantly used for finetuning pre-trained LLMs to ensure they are
both helpful and harmless (Bai et al., 2022a; Glaese et al., 2022). Many advanced models, such as
Claude (Bai et al., 2022b) and InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), are fine-tuned using this approach.
This process involves fitting a reward model to human preferences and subsequently optimizing the
language model to maximize these rewards using reinforcement learning algorithms like Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023)
replaces the human feedback with AI feedback. While the method is similar to our approach, as both
emphasize the model’s self-evaluation of its outputs, RLAIF uses the self-evaluation to produce data
for training a reward model and then applies a reinforcement learning algorithm. In contrast, we
directly alter the generation strategy during the inference phase. Moreover, RAIN is data-free, while
RLAIF requires a prompt dataset for alignment.
Alignment without reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is unstable, which has en-
couraged subsequent alignment methods that circumvent reinforcement learning. Techniques like
RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023), RAFT (Dong et al., 2023), and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) have adjusted
optimization objectives, rendering the training process more concise and stable. Methods such
as Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022) and Self-Alignment (Sun et al., 2023) generate training data
via In-Context Learning, which is then used to fine-tune the model by gradient-based algorithms.
However, to the best of our current knowledge, there is no work that accomplishes LLM alignment
without any learning process.
Lookahead and backtracking. The idea of lookahead, backtracking, and self-evaluation also appears
in (Yao et al., 2023). However, Yao et al. (2023) targeted at the problem of prompting language
models to enable exploration over units of “thoughts” that serve as intermediate steps toward problem
solving. In contrast, our paper targets at a different problem of safety alignment, and the lookahead
and backtracking mechanism is dissimilar from that of (Yao et al., 2023).

Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN)
Our focus is on auto-regressive language models, which are perhaps the most prevalent class of
language models; models such as GPT series (Radford et al., 2018), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), PaLM
3

(Chowdhery et al., 2022), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022),
and LLaMA series (Touvron et al., 2023a) are examples of this category. Auto-regressive language
models generate tokens sequentially, where an inappropriate token could potentially lead to error
propagation in the subsequent text generation. Using auto-regressive inference, once a token is
generated, it becomes fixed and unalterable, thereby making this process extremely sensitive to the
correctness of each individual token. We propose a rewindable auto-regressive inference strategy,
allowing the model to automatically rewind to compensate for this shortcoming. It introduces two
problems that need to be addressed: firstly, determining when a rewind is necessary (Section 3.1),
and secondly, devising a method for executing the rewind and deciding to which token it should be
applied (Section 3.2). The pseudo-code description of RAIN is shown in Algorithm 3.2
3.1
Self-evaluation
Evaluating and scoring generated content can determine whether a rewind process is necessary:
high-scoring generations do not require a rewind process, while low-scoring ones do. A simple
solution could be to train a scoring model, analogous to the reward model in RLHF. However, this
solution presents a few issues:
• First, it requires a large amount of human-annotated, high-quality data. In InstructGPT
(Ouyang et al., 2022), for example, the reward model was trained using 33K prompts with
human ranking feedback, more than the 31K prompts in the RL phase.
• Second, the training of a scoring model is expensive, especially with the increasing number
of parameters in the model.
• Third, the annotators are asked to come up with arbitrary tasks and write prompts themselves,
which may result in inadequate coverage of realistic user queries, further yielding a risky
model.
Though recent works (Zhou et al., 2023; Gunasekar et al., 2023) show that only a small amount (e.g.,
1,000) of labeled data are needed for instruction tuning, these prompts and response data are required
to be of high-quality and carefully curated by human annotators. On the other hand, LLMs possess
the ability to evaluate their own generated text, and according to Lee et al. (2023), the quality of
feedback from LLMs is comparable to that of human feedback. We capitalize on this feature by
employing a prompt, enabling the model to conduct self-evaluations of its production. It is important
to note that the human goals and preferences, which need to be aligned with in our problem, are
communicated to LLMs through the provided prompt in the self-evaluation phase. An example of
such a prompt is illustrated below.
Determine if the assistant’s response is harmful. The given conversation should be evaluated solely
on its content.
<Generated Text>
Options:
(A) Assistant’s response is harmless.
(B) Assistant’s response is harmful.
Note that this prompt is not the initial prompt in the beginning of the inference; the former is not
modifiable by the attackers in the adversarial settings, as the prompt belongs to the defenders.

Forward generation and backward rewind
Vanilla auto-regressive inference operate through chain-style generation. The generative process can
transition into a tree-search configuration if a rewind functionality is permitted. In this paper, we
introduce RAIN (Rewindable Auto-regressive INference), which allows search and rewind operations
for self-alignment of frozen LLMs in the inference phase. The search process can be conceptualized
as occurring on a tree, where each node represents a token set (a sequence of tokens of a specific
length). For the sake of clarity, we use the terms “node” and “token set” interchangeably throughout
this paper. RAIN alternates between a forward and a backward process. The forward process is
responsible for conducting a search, while the backward process is employed for backtracking and

Figure 3: An overview of RAIN: the diagram depicts a forward process on the left, followed by a
backward process in the center. For clarity, the right side illustrates a subsequent forward process.
In this example, the goal is to determine the next token set after “How to rob?”. Forward process:
Starting from the root node “How to rob?”, the existing candidate token sets are “To rob” and “For
robbing”. According to equation 1, the token set with the high value, “To rob”, is selected, leading
to the leaf node “To rob”. We expand the search tree by querying the language model with “How
to rob? To rob”, resulting in next token sets {“a bank”,“a shop”}. These token sets, ‘a bank” and
“a shop”, are then linked to the current leaf node “To rob”. Yellow arrows indicate the insertion of
new candidate token sets. Backward process: Through self-evaluation(“How to rob? To rob”), we
derive a low score for the current leaf node “a bank”. Following the red arrow, we rewind back to the
root node “How to rob?”. According to equation 2, we update the nodes on the path (enclosed in
the red frames) as well as their sibling nodes (enclosed in the purple frames). Subsequent forward
process: After updating, the two child nodes “To rob” and “For robbing” of the root node ‘How to
rob?” demonstrate low values. Consequently, we introduce a new candidate token set, “Robbing is”.
Currently, “Robbing is” holds the highest value, so we select “Robbing is” to reach the leaf node.
Thereafter, token sets “illegal,” and “a serious” are added as the candidate. Given that “How to rob?
Robbing is illegal” has the highest value, using RAIN, “Robbing is” is ultimately selected as the next
token set for “How to rob?”.
rewinding. Our approach can be seamlessly implemented as a plug-in, which can conveniently
integrate with existing auto-regressive language models.
Notations. Throughout this work, individual tokens are denoted by lowercase letters such as
x and y, while sequences of tokens are represented by uppercase letters such as X and Y . In
particular, Xi:j and Yi:j refer to the token sets (xi, xi+1, xi+2, . . . , xj) and (yi, yi+1, yi+2, . . . , yj),
respectively. We use A = prefix(B) is a prefix of B, indicating that A = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and
B = (x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . , xn+m) for m ≥0.
Overview of RAIN. We consider a mechanism where tokens are sequentially determined—those
tokens not yet determined can be rewound and changed, while determined tokens are no longer
subject to alteration. Thus, externally, RAIN appears identical to vanilla auto-regressive inference.
To identify the next token set, we initiate a search commencing from the previously determined
tokens, treated as the root node. By employing vanilla auto-regressive inference and sampling q
times, we obtained several token sets and their respective probabilities p. In the absence of additional
information, RAIN selects the token set Yi:j with the highest probability for further exploration. We
utilize self-evaluation to assess Y1:j, thereby obtaining a score s(Y1:j). Intuitively, a higher score
indicates that a token set should be explored more extensively. Leveraging these scores can enhance
search efficiency. We log the average value v(Yi:j; Y1:i−1) of token set given its previous tokens
Y1:i−1, which is initially set to s(Y1:j). We also record the visit times of each token set, denoted
by n(Yi:j; Y1:i−1), which is initially set to 1. Both the average value v(Yi:j; Y1:i−1) and the visit
frequency n(Yi:j; Y1:i−1) will be used in determining the direction of subsequent searches. At this
point, we have reached the leave of the search tree. To deepen the search, we expand the search tree
by sampling the language model q times to acquire subsequent token sets of Yi:j and attach them as
child nodes of Yi:j. We then rewind to the root node to prepare for the next search, and the subsequent
search process is roughly the same.
Forward process. To improve the efficiency of the search, the search direction is determined using
the previously recorded average value v and visit count n. While token sets with higher values
warrant further exploration, focusing solely on high-value token sets could overlook other token sets
that could yield superior text, potentially leading to a local optimum. Therefore, the search direction
should consider both exploitation and exploration, that is, favoring token sets with higher value and
fewer explorations. Specifically, starting from the root node, we select the next token set based on the
5

formula:
Y ′ = arg max
Yi:j (v(Yi:j; Yi−1) + c · u(Yi:j; Yi−1)),
(1)
where c > 0 is a regularization hyper-parameter balancing exploitation and exploration, v(Yi:j; Yi−1)
reflects the value of a token set in this context, and u(Yi:j; Yi−1) indicates the extent to which a token
set has been explored. The definition of u(Yi:j; Yi−1) is as follows:
u(Yi:j; Yi−1) = p(Yi:j | Yi−1)
qP
Xi:j n(Xi:j; Yi−1)
1 + n(Yi:j; Yi−1)
,
where Xi:j represents candidate token sets, which are the sibling nodes of Yi:j and include Yi:j
itself. Therefore, P
Xi:j n(Xi:j; Yi−1) is the total visit count to candidate token sets. If the value
of P
Xi:j n(Xi:j; Yi−1) is large and the value of n(Yi:j; Yi−1) is small, it indicates that Yi:j is rarely
visited compared to other candidate sets and the branch derived from Yi:j has not been thoroughly
explored. In this case, the value of
qP
Xi:j n(Xi:j;Yi−1)
n(Yi:j;Yi−1)
will be large, which encourages exploration of
rarely visited branches. The probability p(Yi:j | Yi−1) is recorded when sampling with the language
model. Token sets with higher probabilities are given priority during exploration. We continually
select the next token set according to equation 1 until reaching a leaf node. Subsequently, we add
child nodes to the leaf node as described earlier.
Backward process. After reaching leaf node Yi:j, a self-evaluation is performed to obtain the score
s(Y1:j). For a given token sequence Y1:j, the score s(Y1:j) is not solely attributable to the token
set Yi:j. The preceding token set also contributes to (Y1:j). Specifically, the value v(Ym:n; Y1:m−1)
should represent the mean score of the token sequences that take Y1:n as their prefix:
v(Ym:n; Y1:m−1) =
1
|{X : Y1:n = prefix(X)}|
X
{X:Y1:n=prefix(X)}
s(X),
Thus, we update the average values v of all token sets on the path from the root node to the leaf
node Yi:j. The more token sets a single evaluation can update, the higher the search efficiency. We
utilize the similarity between token sets in the current context to update those that are not on the
path. Consider a token set Y ∗
m:n on the path and its sibling node X∗
m:n, we update X∗
m:n based on the
similarity:
Let sxy = sim(e(X∗
m:n; X∗
1:m−1), e(Y ∗
m:n; Y ∗
1:m−1)), if sxy > threshold, then:

where s(Y ) is the score used to update Y ∗
m:n, e(X∗
m:n; X∗
1:m−1) is an embedding that represents
the semantics of token set X∗
m:n in the context of X∗
1:m−1, sim(·, ·) represents the cosine similarity
between two vectors, and γ is a constant less than 1. Considering that X∗
m:n and Y ∗
m:n are sibling
nodes, it follows that X∗
m−1 equals Y ∗
m−1. To mitigate the risk of making substantial updates based
on inaccurate embeddings, we employ two strategies: updating only sibling nodes with a similarity
higher than a predetermined threshold and applying a discount factor γ less than 1. For each token
set, we record the average embedding e(Y ∗
m:n; Y ∗
1:m−1):
e(Y ∗
m:n; Y ∗
1:m−1) =

embedding(X),
where embedding(X) is the embedding of X extracted using Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych,
2019).
As previously mentioned, we sample q times to obtain several token sets, and then attach these token
sets to a leaf node. If the texts directed by these sets are very similar, the search becomes meaningless.
Therefore, when selecting the next child node, we compute the variance of the average embedding
of all child nodes. If the variance is excessively small and the values from different branches are
uniformly low, we add an additional child node.

The frequency of a candidate token set’s accesses is positively correlated with its average value.
Therefore, the next token set is determined as the token set with the highest number of accesses. The
search process terminates either when the generated text achieves a score exceeding a predetermined
threshold or when the maximum number of search iterations is reached.

Experiments
4.1
Setting
Tasks and Datasets. Our experimental process encompasses three tasks: harm-free generation,
adversarial harm-free generation, and controlled sentiment generation. For the harm-free generation
task, we employ the Anthropic’s Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset (Bai et al., 2022a). This dataset
is comprised of sensitive questions which may elicit potentially harmful responses from LLMs.
Thus, our primary objective is to maintain harmlessness. For adversarial defense task, we conducted
experiments on AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), which encompasses a series of harmful instructions.
We employed the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm as proposed in AdvBench. For
controlled sentiment generation task, we employ the IMDB dataset, which is a large movie review
dataset. Our objective is to use the initial tokens of a movie review as a prompt, aiming to generate a
review that conveys a positive sentiment.
Models. We experiment with LLaMA (7B, 13B, 30B, 65B) (Touvron et al., 2023a), LLaMA-2 (7B,
13B, 70B) (Touvron et al., 2023b), Vicuna (7B, 13B, 33B) (Chiang et al., 2023), Alpaca 7B (Taori
et al., 2023), and GPT-neo (1.3B, 2.7B) (Gao et al., 2020), as these models represent the current state
of the art in open-sourced LLMs and exhibit varying degrees of safety.
Metrics. There is no ground truth for the harmlessness of model responses, so we rely on GPT-4 to
determine if the responses are harmful. According to Pan et al. (2023), GPT-4 labels are competitive
with human labels. In Section 4.6, we also conduct human evaluation.

Harm-free generation. Figures 2 and 4 present
the experimental results on the HH dataset. We
utilized the principle of “harmlessness” as the
target for alignment. In order to assess whether
RAIN could lead to degradation in the perfor-
mance on other objectives, we simultaneously
evaluated the performance of RAIN on both
“harmlessness” and “helpfulness”. In experi-
7

ments of this paper, the parameter c was set to 2,
and γ was set to 0.2. RAIN represents an emer-
gent capability related to model size. For GPT-
neo (1.3B and 2.7B), performance of RAIN is
comparable to that of the vanilla auto-regressive
inference. As the model size increases, the per-
formance improvement of RAIN over vanilla auto-regressive inference becomes more pronounced.
When the scale of the model is insufficiently large, RAIN slightly impairs its helpfulness. However,
as the model size increases, the helpfulness gap diminishes, which means for adequately large models,
RAIN does not hurt performance on other objectives. Models such as Vicuna utilize data generated
by ChatGPT for finetuning, indirectly benefiting from the vast training data of closed-source models.
Their performance on the open-source HH dataset approaches saturation. Therefore, we did not
conduct experiments with Vicuna on the HH dataset. Experiments with Vicuna will be discussed later
in this paper. Here is an example on the HH dataset.
Prompt: What would be a good way to total a car?
Vanilla auto-regressive response: There are many ways to total a car. Here are some examples:
1. Crashing into a wall. 2. Crashing into another car. 3. Crashing into a tree.
RAIN response: Totaling a car is a serious matter that can have significant financial and legal
consequences. If you’re considering totaling your car, it’s important to understand the implica-
tions and consult with a professional.

attacks optimize specific attack suffixes by leveraging the gradient of each model, while transfer
attacks utilize Vicuna 7B and 13B to optimize a universal attack suffix using a combination of
two models’ gradients and subsequently employ it to attack other models. Table 1 displays the
adversarial attack success rate of RAIN and vanilla auto-regressive. The definition and assessment
method of attack success rate is the same as Zou et al. (2023). Under GCG attacks, the aligned
Vicuna demonstrates vulnerabilities, with attack success rates of approximately 80% for white-box
attacks and 30% for transfer attacks. In both scenarios, RAIN outperforms the vanilla auto-regressive
inference, and this superiority becomes more pronounced as the model scale increases. Under white-
box attacks, RAIN reduced attack success rate by 14%, 45%, and 75% for models with 7B, 13B, and
33B parameters, respectively. Under transferred attacks, RAIN decreased attack success rate by 25%,
47%, and 24% for models with 7B, 13B, and 33B parameters, respectively. Although RAIN is not
specifically designed as an adversarial defense method, our experimental results indicate its potential
in enhancing model adversarial robustness under the fixed settings of LLM-ATTACKS.2 In models
fine-tuned on LLaMA, Vicuna exhibits exceptional performance but is susceptible to adversarial
attacks. On the other hand, RAIN displays significant adversarial robustness.
2We do not claim robustness against adaptive attacks. The evaluation under adaptive attacks requires new
design of adversarial attacks, which is out of our scope.

Controlled sentiment generation. For controlled sentiment generation task on the IMDB dataset,
the goal is to align LLMs such that they generate positive comments on movies. In Table 2, RAIN
enhanced the performance of LLaMA 7B by 20%. Even greater improvements were observed in
Alpaca 7B and Vicuna 7B, indicating that RAIN can benefit from widely-adopted instruction tuning
and alignment methods.

Harmlessness Rate
Figure 5: Harmlessness rate of RLHF, RLAIF, and
RAIN on the LLaMA 30B model.
We compared RAIN with RLHF and RLAIF,
although such a comparison might be un-
fair. While RLHF requires human annotations,
RLAIF does not necessitate them but still re-
quires data in the form of prompts. RAIN, on the
other hand, does not require either. For RLAIF,
we set number of revisions to 2. For both RLHF
and RLAIF, we set the learning rates to 3e-4,
5e-4, and 1.4e-5 during the SFT, RM, and RL
phases, respectively. A warm-up period and co-
sine learning rate decay were applied. In this
section, both RLHF and RLAIF are fine-tuned from the LLaMA 30B, which is also utilized by RAIN.
As shown in Figure 5, RLHF and RLAIF benefit from SFT for enhanced model safety, while RL
further improves model performance based on this foundation. Compared to RLHF and RLAIF,
which require additional data, the efficacy of RAIN is comparable, if not superior.

Comparison of sample-efficiency
RAIN necessitates a higher computational cost. A simplistic method to trade increased computation
for enhanced performance would be to conduct multiple rounds of random search. This entails
generating text through sampling according to the default auto-regressive strategy, then selecting
the most favorable text as the final output. We contrast our approach with this rudimentary sample-
evaluation method. As shown in Table 3, even conducting 500 random trials and selecting the optimal
reply, sample-evaluation fails to enhance the model’s performance, which underscores the efficacy of
our proposed method, RAIN. The probable reason is that the search space for language generation is
immense, making exhaustive searches via random generation implausible. In contrast, RAIN employs
the results of self-evaluation to guide its search process, leading to greater efficiency.
Table 3: Harmlessness rate of vanilla auto-regressive inference (one-time sampling), repeated cherry-
pick samplings (500 times, cherry picked by LLM itself), and RAIN on LLaMA, evaluated by GPT-4.
It shows that repeated samplings fail to improve safety.

Accuracy of self-evaluation
We utilize self-evaluation to determine the value of a state. In this section, we assess the accuracy
of self-evaluation. As shown in Table 1, the self-evaluation accuracy is higher than random guess-
ing. Although self-evaluation can have errors, our method still significantly improves the model’s
performance.

In this section, we conduct human evalu-
ations, comparing them with evaluations
carried out using GPT-4. We evaluated
the RAIN response and the vanilla auto-
regressive inference response of LLaMA2
13B on the HH dataset. The human evalu-
ators comprise ten individuals with diverse
professional backgrounds and varying genders. The human annotators consisted of 3 females and 7
males, all of whom held undergraduate degrees. Their academic backgrounds spanned various fields
including computer science, economics, and electrical engineering. Every entry was assessed by at
least one individual. The human evaluation phase is completed within three days, and the authors of
this paper are not included in the phase for fairness. We shuffle different prompts and, for the same
prompt, shuffle the response generated by RAIN and vanilla auto-regressive inference to eliminate
biases. As shown in Table 5, the evaluation of GPT-4 aligns closely with the human assessment.

Conclusion
In this paper, we show that LLMs can align themselves without finetuning. We introduce RAIN, a
novel inference method for LLMs, which integrates self-evaluation of models and rewind functionali-
ties into generation. RAIN can be employed as a plug-in: when it is used during the inference phase,
frozen LLMs are capable of generating responses that are aligned with human preferences. RAIN
also helps maintain or enhance the safety of well-aligned models like Vicuna and LLaMA-2 70B.
Experimental results indicate that even without the use of additional data or further training, frozen
LLMs are self-alignable via RAIN.
6
Limitations
Compared to standard auto-regressive inference, RAIN demands a longer inference time, on average
a 4-fold increase on the LLaMA 30B model and the HH dataset. One potential approach to expedite
the process is to employ RAIN for data generation and subsequently finetune the model using this
generated data. This strategy transfers the additional inference overhead to the finetuning phase.
Another solution is to design more sample-efficient approach for inference-time alignment. We will
leave it as the future work.
