Preface
Purpose
The purpose of The Electrical Engineering Handbook, 3rd Edition is to provide a ready reference for the
practicing engineer in industry, government, and academia, as well as aid students of engineering. The third
edition has a new look and comprises six volumes including:
Circuits, Signals, and Speech and Image Processing
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar
Sensors, Nanoscience, Biomedical Engineering, and Instruments
Broadcasting and Optical Communication Technology
Computers, Software Engineering, and Digital Devices
Systems, Controls, Embedded Systems, Energy, and Machines
Each volume is edited by Richard C. Dorf, and is a comprehensive format that encompasses the many
aspects of electrical engineering with articles from internationally recognized contributors. The goal is to
provide the most up-to-date information in the classical ﬁelds of circuits, signal processing, electronics,
electromagnetic ﬁelds, energy devices, systems, and electrical effects and devices, while covering the emerging
ﬁelds of communications, nanotechnology, biometrics, digital devices, computer engineering, systems, and
biomedical engineering. In addition, a complete compendium of information regarding physical, chemical,
and materials data, as well as widely inclusive information on mathematics is included in each volume. Many
articles from this volume and the other ﬁve volumes have been completely revised or updated to ﬁt the needs
of today and many new chapters have been added.
The purpose of this volume (Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics,
and Radar) is to provide a ready reference to subjects in the ﬁelds of electronics, integrated circuits, power
electronics, optoelectronics, electromagnetics, light waves, and radar. We also include a section on electrical
effects and devices. Here we provide the basic information for understanding these ﬁelds. We also provide
information about the emerging ﬁelds of microlithography and power electronics.
Organization
The information is organized into four sections. The ﬁrst three sections encompass 29 chapters and the last
section summarizes the applicable mathematics, symbols, and physical constants.
Most articles include three important and useful categories: deﬁning terms, references, and further
information. Deﬁning terms are key deﬁnitions and the ﬁrst occurrence of each term deﬁned is indicated in
boldface in the text. The deﬁnitions of these terms are summarized as a list at the end of each chapter or
article. The references provide a list of useful books and articles for follow-up reading. Finally, further
information provides some general and useful sources of additional information on the topic.
Locating Your Topic
Numerous avenues of access to information are provided. A complete table of contents is presented at the
front of the book. In addition, an individual table of contents precedes each section. Finally, each chapter
begins with its own table of contents. The reader should look over these tables of contents to become familiar

with the structure, organization, and content of the book. For example, see Section II: Electromagnetics, then
Chapter 17: Antennas, and then Chapter 17.2: Aperture. This tree-and-branch table of contents enables the
reader to move up the tree to locate information on the topic of interest.
Two indexes have been compiled to provide multiple means of accessing information: subject index and
index of contributing authors. The subject index can also be used to locate key deﬁnitions. The page on which
the deﬁnition appears for each key (deﬁning) term is clearly identiﬁed in the subject index.
The Electrical Engineering Handbook, 3rd Edition is designed to provide answers to most inquiries and direct
the inquirer to further sources and references. We hope that this handbook will be referred to often and that
informational requirements will be satisﬁed effectively.
Acknowledgments
This handbook is testimony to the dedication of the Board of Advisors, the publishers, and my editorial
associates. I particularly wish to acknowledge at Taylor & Francis Nora Konopka, Publisher; Helena Redshaw,
Editorial Project Development Manager; and Susan Fox, Project Editor. Finally, I am indebted to the
support of Elizabeth Spangenberger, Editorial Assistant.

Physical Properties

Electronic applications of semiconductors are based on our ability to vary their properties on a very small
scale. In conventional semiconductor devices, one can easily alter charge carrier concentrations, ﬁelds, and
current densities over distances of 0.1 to 10 mm. Even smaller characteristic lengths of 10 to 100 nm are feasible
in materials with an engineered band structure. This section reviews the essential physics underlying modern
semiconductor technology.
Energy Bands
In crystalline semiconductors atoms are arranged in periodic arrays known as crystalline lattices. The lattice
structure of silicon is shown in Figure 1.1. Germanium and diamond have the same structure but with
different interatomic distances. As a consequence of this periodic arrangement, the allowed energy levels of
electrons are grouped into energy bands, as shown in Figure 1.2. The probability that an electron will occupy
an allowed quantum state with energy E is
f ¼ ½1 þ expðE  FÞ=kBT	1
ð1:1Þ
Here, kB ¼ 1/11,606 eV/K denotes the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and F is a parameter
known as the Fermi level. If the energy E . F þ 3kBT, then f(E) , 0.05 and these states are mostly empty.
1-1

Similarly, the states with E , F  3kBT are mostly occupied by electrons. In a typical metal (Figure 1.2(a)), the
energy level E ¼ F is allowed, and only one energy band is partially ﬁlled. (In metals like aluminum, the
partially ﬁlled band in Figure 1.2(a) may actually represent a combination of several overlapping bands.)
The remaining energy bands are either completely ﬁlled or totally empty. Obviously, the empty energy bands
do not contribute to the charge transfer. It is a fundamental result of solid-state physics that energy bands that
are completely ﬁlled also do not contribute. What happens is that in the ﬁlled bands the average velocity of
electrons is equal to zero. In semiconductors (and insulators) the Fermi level falls within a forbidden energy
gap so that two of the energy bands are partially ﬁlled by electrons and may give rise to electron current. The
upper partially ﬁlled band is called the conduction band while the lower is known as the valence band. The
number of electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor is relatively small and can be easily changed
by adding impurities. In metals, the number of free carriers is large and is not sensitive to doping.
A more detailed description of energy bands in a crystalline semiconductor is based on the Bloch theorem,
which states that an electron wave function has the form (Bloch wave):
C
C
C
C
Cbk ¼ ubkðrÞ expði krÞ
ð1:2Þ
where r is the radius vector of electron, the modulating function ubkðrÞ has the periodicity of the lattice, and
the quantum state is characterized by wave vector k and the band number b. Physically, Equation (1.2) means
that an electron wave propagates through a periodic lattice without attenuation. For each energy band one can
consider the dispersion law E ¼ Eb(k). Since (see Figure 1.2(b)) in the conduction band only the states with
energies close to the bottom, Ec, are occupied, it sufﬁces to consider the E(k) dependence near Ec. The
simpliﬁed band diagrams of Si and GaAs are shown in Figure 1.3.
Electrons and Holes
The concentration of electrons in the valence band can be controlled by introducing impurity atoms.
For example, the substitutional doping of Si with As results in a local energy level with an energy about
DWd < 45 meV below the conduction band edge, Ec (Figure 1.2(b)). At room temperature this impurity center

is readily ionized, and (in the absence of other impurities) the concentration of electrons is close to the
concentration of As atoms. Impurities of this type are known as donors.
While considering the contribution jp of the predominantly ﬁlled valence band to the current density, it is
convenient to concentrate on the few missing electrons. This is achieved as follows: let v(k) be the velocity of
electron described by the wave function (1.2). Then

Here, we have noted again that a completely ﬁlled band does not contribute to the current density. The picture
emerging from Equation (1.3) is that of particles (known as holes) with the charge þq and velocities
corresponding to those of missing electrons. The concentration of holes in the valence band is controlled by

adding acceptor-type impurities (such as boron in silicon), which form local energy levels close to the top of
the valence band. At room temperature these energy levels are occupied by electrons that come from the
valence band and leave the holes behind. Assuming that the Fermi level is removed from both Ec and Ev by at
least 3kBT (a nondegenerate semiconductor), the concentrations of electrons and holes are given by
n ¼ Nc exp½ðF  EcÞ=kBT

and

where Nc ¼ 2ð2mn*pkBTÞ3=2=h3 and Nv  2ð2mp*pkBTÞ3=2=h3 are the effective densities of states in the
conduction and valence bands, respectively, h is Plank constant, and the effective masses mn* and mp* depend on
the details of the band structure (Pierret, 1987).

Corresponding temperature dependence is shown for silicon in Figure 1.4. Around room temperature

is no longer dependent on the doping level (Figure 1.4). In this so-called intrinsic regime electrons come
directly from the valence band. A loss of technological control over n and p makes this regime unattractive for
electronic applications. Since Ti / Eg the transition to the intrinsic region can be delayed by using widegap
semiconductors. Both silicon carbide (several types of SiC with different lattice structures are available with
Eg ¼ 2.2–2.86 eV) and diamond (Eg ¼ 5.5 eV) have been used to fabricate diodes and transistors operating in
the 300 to 700–C temperature range.
Transport Properties
In a semiconductor the motion of an electron is affected by frequent collisions with phonons (quanta of lattice
vibrations), impurities, and crystal imperfections. In weak uniform electric ﬁelds, E, the carrier drift velocity,
vd, is determined by the balance of the electric and collision forces:
mn*vd=t ¼ qE
ð1:7Þ
where t is the momentum relaxation time. Consequently vd ¼ mnE, where mn ¼ qt=mn* is the electron
mobility. For an n-type semiconductor with uniform electron density, n, the current density jn ¼ qnvd and
we obtain Ohm’s law jn ¼ sE with the conductivity s ¼ qnmn. The momentum relaxation time can be
approximately expressed as
1=t ¼ 1=tii þ 1=tni þ 1=tac þ 1=tnpo þ 1=tpo þ 1=tpe þ . . .
ð1:8Þ
where tii, tni, tac, tnpo, tpo, tpe are the relaxation times due to ionized impurity, neutral impurity, acoustic
phonon, nonpolar optical, polar optical, and piezoelectric scattering, respectively.
In the presence of concentration gradients, electron current density is given by the drift-diffusion equation:
jn ¼ qnmnE þ qDnHn
ð1:9Þ
where the diffusion coefﬁcient Dn is related to mobility by the Einstein relation Dn ¼ (kBT/q)mn.
A similar equation can be written for holes and the total current density is j ¼ jn þ jp. The right-hand side of
Equation (1.9) may contain additional terms corresponding to temperature gradient and compositional
nonuniformity of the material (Wolfe et al., 1989).
In sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁelds the drift velocity is no longer proportional to the electric ﬁeld. Typical
velocity–ﬁeld dependencies for several semiconductors are shown in Figure 1.5. In GaAs vdðEÞ dependence is

not monotonic, which results in negative differential conductivity. Physically, this effect is related to the
transfer of electrons from the conduction band to a secondary valley (see Figure 1.3).
The limiting value vs of the drift velocity in a strong electric ﬁeld is known as the saturation velocity and is
usually within the 107 to 3·107 cm/sec range. As semiconductor device dimensions are scaled down to the
submicrometer range, vs becomes an important parameter that determines the upper limits of device
performance. The curves shown in Figure 1.5 were obtained for uniform semiconductors under steady-state
conditions. Strictly speaking, this is not the case with actual semiconductor devices, where velocity can
‘‘overshoot’’ the value shown in Figure 1.5. This effect is important for Si devices shorter than 0.1 mm (0.25 mm
for GaAs devices) (Shur, 1990; Ferry, 1991). In such extreme cases the drift-diffusion equation (1.9) is no
longer adequate, and the analysis is based on the Boltzmann transport equation:
qf
qt þ vHf þ qE Hpf ¼
qf
qt


coll
ð1:10Þ
Here, f denotes the distribution function (number of electrons per unit volume of the phase space, i.e.,
f ¼ dn/d3rd3p), v is electron velocity, p is momentum, and (qf /qt)coll is the ‘‘collision integral’’ describing the
change of f caused by collision processes described earlier. For the purpose of semiconductor modeling,
Equation (1.10) can be solved directly using various numerical techniques, including the method of moments
(hydrodynamic modeling) or Monte-Carlo approach. The drift-diffusion equation (1.9) follows from
Equation (1.10) as a special case. For even shorter devices quantum effects become important and device
modeling may involve quantum transport theory (Ferry, 1991).
Hall Effect
In a uniform magnetic ﬁeld electrons move along circular orbits in a plane normal to the magnetic ﬁeld B with
the angular (cyclotron) frequency oc ¼ qB=mn*. For a uniform semiconductor the current density satisﬁes the
equation:
j ¼ sðE þ RH½jB	Þ
ð1:11Þ
In the usual weak-ﬁeld limit oct ,, 1 the Hall coefﬁcient RH ¼ r/nq and the Hall factor r depend on the
dominating scattering mode. It varies between 3p/8 < 1.18 (acoustic phonon scattering) and 315p/518 < 1.93
(ionized impurity scattering).
The Hall coefﬁcient can be measured as RH ¼ Vy d/IxB using the test structure shown in Figure 1.6. In this
expression Vy is the Hall voltage corresponding to Iy ¼ 0 and d denotes the ﬁlm thickness.
Combining the results of the Hall and conductivity measurements one can extract the carrier concen-
tration type (the signs of Vy are opposite for n-type and p-type semiconductors) and Hall mobility mH ¼ rm:
mH ¼ RHs;
n ¼ r=qRH
ð1:12Þ
Measurements of this type are routinely used to extract concentration and mobility in doped semiconductors.
The weak-ﬁeld Hall effect is also used for the purpose of magnetic ﬁeld measurements.
In strong magnetic ﬁelds oct .. 1 and on the average an electron completes several circular orbits without
a collision. Instead of the conventional Eb(k) dependence, the allowed electron energy levels in the magnetic
ﬁeld are given by (" ¼ h/2p; s ¼ 0, 1, 2, . . .):
Es ¼ "oc ðs þ 1=2Þ þ "2k2
z=2mn*
ð1:13Þ
The ﬁrst term in Equation (1.13) describes the so-called Landau levels, while the second corresponds to the
kinetic energy of motion along the magnetic ﬁeld B ¼ Bz. In a pseudo-two-dimensional system like the
channel of a ﬁeld-effect transistor the second term in Equation (1.13) does not appear, since the motion of
1-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

electrons occurs in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.1 In such a structure the electron density of
states (number of allowed quantum states per unit energy interval) is peaked at the Landau level. Since oc / B,
the positions of these peaks relative to the Fermi level are controlled by the magnetic ﬁeld.
The most striking consequence of this phenomenon is the quantum Hall effect, which manifests itself as a
stepwise change of the Hall resistance rxy ¼ Vy/Ix as a function of magnetic ﬁeld (see Figure 1.7). At low
temperature (required to establish the condition t55o1
c ) it can be shown (von Klitzing, 1986) that
rxy ¼ h=sq2
ð1:14Þ
where s is the number of the highest occupied Landau level. Accordingly, when the increased magnetic ﬁeld
pushes the sth Landau level above the Fermi level, rxy changes from h/sq2 to h/(s  1)q2. This stepwise change
of rxy is seen in Figure 1.7. Localized states produced by crystal defects determine the shape of the rxy(B)
dependence between the plateaus given by Equation (1.14). They are also responsible for the disappearance of
rxx ¼ Vx/Ix between the transition points (see Figure 1.7). The quantized Hall resistance rxy is expressed in
terms of fundamental constants and can be used as a resistance standard that permits one to measure an
electrical resistance with better accuracy than any wire resistor standard. In an ultraquantum magnetic ﬁeld,
i.e., when only the lowest Landau level is occupied, plateaus of the Hall resistance are also observed at
fractional s (the fractional quantum Hall effect). These plateaus are related to the Coulomb interaction of
electrons.
Electrical Breakdown
In sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁelds a measurable fraction of electrons (or holes) acquires sufﬁcient energy to
break the valence bond. Such an event (called impact ionization) results in the creation of an electron–hole
pair by the energetic electron. Both the primary and secondary electrons as well as the hole are accelerated by
the electric ﬁeld and may participate in further acts of impact ionization. Usually, the impact ionization is
balanced by recombination processes. If the applied voltage is high enough, however, the process of electron
1To simplify the matter we do not discuss surface subbands, which is justiﬁed as long as only the lowest of them is occupied.

multiplication leads to avalanche breakdown. The threshold energy Eth (the minimum electron energy
required to produce an electron–hole pair) is determined by energy and momentum conservation laws. The
latter usually results in Eth , Eg, as shown in Table 1.1.
The ﬁeld dependence of the impact ionization is usually described by the impact ionization coefﬁcient ai,
deﬁned as the average number of electron–hole pairs created by a charge carrier per unit distance traveled.
A simple analytical expression for ai (Okuto and Crowell, 1972) can be written as

An alternative breakdown mechanism is tunneling breakdown, which occurs in highly doped semicon-
ductors when electrons may tunnel from occupied states in the valence band into the empty states of the
conduction band.
Optical Properties and Recombination Processes
If the energy of an incident photon "o . Eg, then the energy conservation law permits a direct band-to-band
transition, as indicated in Figure 1.2(b). Because the photon’s momentum is negligible compared to that of an
electron or hole, the electron’s momentum "k does not change in a direct transition. Consequently, direct
transitions are possible only in direct-gap semiconductors where the conduction band minimum and the
valence band maximum occur at the same k. The same is true for the reverse transition, where the electron
is transferred from the conduction to the valence band and a photon is emitted. Direct-gap semiconductors
(e.g., GaAs) are widely used in optoelectronics.
In indirect-band materials (e.g., Si, see Figure 1.3(a)), a band-to-band transition requires a change of
momentum that cannot be accomplished by absorption or emission of a photon. Indirect band-to-band
transitions require the emission or absorption of a phonon and are much less probable than direct transitions.
For "o , Eg (i.e., for l . lc ¼ 1.24 mm/Eg [eV] – cutoff wavelength) band-to-band transitions do not
occur, but light can be absorbed by a variety of the so-called subgap processes. These processes include
the absorption by free carriers, formation of excitons (bound electron–hole pairs whose formation requires
less energy than the creation of a free electron and a free hole), transitions involving localized states
(e.g., from an acceptor state to the conduction band), and phonon absorption. Both band-to-band and
subgap processes may be responsible for the increase of the free charge carriers concentration. The resulting
reduction of the resistivity of illuminated semiconductors is called photoconductivity and is used in
photodetectors.
In a strong magnetic ﬁeld (oct .. 1) the absorption of microwave radiation is peaked at o ¼ oc. At this
frequency the photon energy is equal to the distance between two Landau levels, i.e., "o ¼ Esþ1  Es with
reference to Equation (1.13). This effect, known as cyclotron resonance, is used to measure the effective masses
of charge carriers in semiconductors (in a simplest case of isotropic E(k) dependence, mn* ¼ qB=oc).
In indirect-gap materials like silicon, the generation and annihilation (or recombination) of electron–hole
pairs is often a two-step process. First, an electron (or a hole) is trapped in a localized state (called a
recombination center) with the energy near the center of the energy gap. In a second step, the electron (or
hole) is transferred to the valence (conduction) band. The net rate of recombination per unit volume per unit
time is given by the Shockley–Read–Hall theory as
R ¼
np  n2
i
tnðp þ p1Þ þ tpðn þ n1Þ
ð1:16Þ
where tn, tp, p1, and n1 are parameters depending on the concentration and the physical nature of recom-
bination centers and temperature. Note that the sign of R indicates the tendency of a semiconductor toward
equilibrium (where np ¼ n2
p, and R ¼ 0). For example, in the depleted region np , n2
i and R , 0, so that
charge carriers are generated.
Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is the dominating recombination mechanism in moderately doped
silicon. Other recombination mechanisms (e.g., Auger) become important in heavily doped semiconductors
(Wolfe et al., 1989; Shur, 1990; Ferry, 1991).
The recombination processes are fundamental for semiconductor device theory, where they are usually
modeled using the continuity equation:

Nanostructure Engineering
Epitaxial growth techniques, especially molecular beam epitaxy and metal–organic chemical vapor deposition,
allow monolayer control in the chemical composition process. Both single thin layers and superlattices can be
obtained by such methods. The electronic properties of these structures are of interest for potential device
applications. In a single quantum well, electrons are bound in the conﬁning well potential. For example, in a
rectangular quantum well of width b and inﬁnite walls, the allowed energy levels are
EsðkÞ ¼ p2s2"2=ð2mn*b2Þ þ "2k2=ð2mn*Þ;
s ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . .
ð1:18Þ
where k is the electron wave vector parallel to the plane of the semiconductor layer. The charge carriers in
quantum wells exhibit conﬁned particle behavior. Since Es / b  2, well structures can be grown with distance
between energy levels equal to a desired photon energy. Furthermore, the photoluminescence intensity is
enhanced because of carrier conﬁnement. These properties are advantageous in fabrication of lasers and
photodetectors.
If a quantum well is placed between two thin barriers, the tunneling probability is greatly enhanced when
the energy level in the quantum well coincides with the Fermi energy (resonant tunneling). The distance
between this ‘‘resonant’’ energy level and the Fermi level is controlled by the applied voltage. Consequently, the
current peaks at the voltage corresponding to the resonant tunneling condition. The resulting negative
differential resistance effect has been used to fabricate microwave generators operating at both room and
cryogenic temperatures.
Two kinds of superlattices are possible: compositional and doping. Compositional superlattices are made of
alternating layers of semiconductors with different energy gaps. Doping superlattices consist of alternating
n- and p-type layers of the same semiconductor. The potential is modulated by electric ﬁelds arising from the
charged dopants. Compositional superlattices can be grown as lattice matched or as strained layers. The latter
are used for modiﬁcation of the band structure, which depends on the lattice constant to produce desirable
properties.
In superlattices energy levels of individual quantum wells are split into minibands as a result of electron
tunneling through the wide-bandgap layers. This occurs if the electron mean free path is larger than the
superlattice period. In such structures the electron motion perpendicular to the layer is quantized. In a one-
dimensional tight binding approximation the miniband can be described as
EðkÞ ¼ E0½1  cosðkaÞ	
ð1:19Þ
where a is the superlattice period and E0 is the half-width of the energy band. The electron group velocity:
v ¼ "1qEðkÞ=qk ¼ ðE0a="Þ
sinðkaÞ
ð1:20Þ
is a decreasing function of k (and hence of energy) for k . p/2a. The higher energy states with k . p/2a may
become occupied if the electrons are heated by the external ﬁeld. As a result, a negative differential resistance
can be achieved at high electric ﬁelds. The weak-ﬁeld mobility in a superlattice may exceed that of the bulk
material because of the separation of dopants if only barriers are doped. In such modulated structures, the
increased spatial separation between electrons and holes is also responsible for a strong increase in
recombination lifetimes.
Disordered Semiconductors
Both amorphous and heavily doped semiconductors are ﬁnding increasing applications in semiconductor
technology. The electronic processes in these materials have speciﬁc features arising from the lack of long-
range order.

Amorphous semiconductors do not have a crystalline lattice, and their properties are determined by the
arrangement of the nearest neighboring atoms. Even so, experimental data show that the forbidden energy
band concept can be applied to characterize their electrical properties. However, the disordered nature of these
materials results in a large number of localized quantum states with energies within the energy gap. The
localized states in the upper and lower half of the gap behave like acceptors and donors, respectively. As an
example, consider the density of states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) shown in Figure 1.8. The
distribution of the localized states is not symmetrical with respect to the middle of the energy gap. In
particular, the undoped hydrogenated amorphous silicon is an n-type semiconductor.
Usually amorphous semiconductors are not sensitive to the presence of impurity atoms, which saturate all
their chemical bonds in the ﬂexible network of the host atoms. (Compare this with a situation in crystalline
silicon where an arsenic impurity can form only four chemical bonds with the host lattice, leaving the ﬁfth
responsible for the formation of the donor state.) Consequently, the doping of amorphous semiconductors is
difﬁcult to accomplish. However, in hydrogenated a-Si (which can be prepared by the glow discharge
decomposition of silane), the density of the localized states is considerably reduced and the conductivity of
this material can be controlled by doping. As in crystalline semiconductors, the charge carrier concentration in
hydrogenated a-Si can also be affected by light and strong ﬁeld effects. The a-Si is used in applications that
require deposition of thin-ﬁlm semiconductors over large areas (xerography, solar cells, thin-ﬁlm transistors
[TFT] for liquid-crystal displays). The a-Si device performance degrades with time under electric stress (TFTs)
or under illumination (Staebler–Wronski effect) because of the creation of new localized states.
An impurity band in crystalline semiconductors is another example of a disordered system. Indeed, the
impurity atoms are randomly distributed within the host lattice. For lightly doped semiconductors at room
temperature, the random potential associated with charged impurities can usually be ignored. As the doping
level increases, however, a single energy level of a donor or an acceptor is transformed into an energy band

with a width determined by impurity concentrations. Unless the degree of compensation is unusually high,
this reduces the activation energy compared to lightly doped semiconductors. The activation energy is further
reduced by the overlap of the wave functions associated with the individual donor or acceptor states.
For sufﬁciently heavy doping, i.e., for Nd . Ndc ¼ (0.2/aB)3, the ionization energy is reduced to zero, and the

Diodes
Miran Milkovic
Diodes are the most widely used devices in low- and high-speed electronic circuits and in rectiﬁers and power
supplies. Other applications are in voltage regulators, detectors, and demodulators. Rectiﬁer diodes are
capable of conducting several hundred amperes in the forward direction and less than 1 mA in the reverse
direction. Zener diodes are ordinary diodes operated in the Zener or avalanche region and are used as voltage
regulators. Varactor diodes are ordinary diodes used in reverse biasing as voltage-dependent capacitors. Tunnel
diodes and quantum well devices have a negative differential resistance and are capable of operating in the
upper gigahertz region. Photodiodes are ordinary diodes operated in the reverse direction. They are sensitive
to light and are used as light sensors. Solar cells are diodes which convert light energy into electrical energy.
Schottky diodes, also known as metal-semiconductor diodes, are extremely fast because they are majority
carrier devices.

pn-Junction Diode
A pn-diode is a semiconductor device having a p-region, a n-region, and a junction between the regions.
Modern planar semiconductor pn-junction diodes are fabricated by diffusion or implantation of impurities
into a semiconductor. An n-type semiconductor has a relatively large density of free electrons to conduct
electric current, and the p-type semiconductor has a relatively large concentration of ‘‘free’’ holes to conduct
electric current. The pn-junction is formed during the fabrication process. There is a large concentration of
holes in the p-semiconductor and a large concentration of electrons in the n-semiconductor. Because of their
large concentration gradients, holes and electrons start to diffuse across the junction. As holes move across the
junction, negative immobile charges (acceptors) are uncovered on the p side, and positive immobile charges
(donors) are uncovered on the n side due to the movement of electrons across the junction. When sufﬁcient
numbers of the immobile charges on both sides of the junction are uncovered, a potential energy barrier
voltage V0 is created by the uncovered acceptors and donors. This barrier voltage prevents further diffusion of
holes and electrons across the junction. The charge distribution of acceptors and donors establishes an
opposing electric ﬁeld, E, which at equilibrium prevents a further diffusion of carriers across the junction. This
equilibrium can be regarded as the ﬂow of two equal and opposite currents across the junction, such that the
net current across the junction is equal to zero. Thus, one component represents the diffusion of carriers
across the junction and the other component represents the drift of carriers across the junction due to the
electric ﬁeld E in the junction. The barrier voltage V0 is, according to the Boltzmann relation (Grove, 1967;
Foustad, 1994):
V0 ¼ VT ln½pp=pn	
ð1:21Þ
In this equation, pp is the concentration of holes in the p-material and pn is the concentration of holes in the
n-material. VT is the thermal voltage. VT ¼ 26 mV at room temperature (300 K). With
pp < NA and pn < n2
i
ND
where ni is the intrinsic concentration, the barrier voltage V0 becomes approximately (Sze, 1985; Fonstad,
1994):
V0 ¼ VT ln½NAND=n2
i 	
ð1:22Þ
Here, NA denotes the concentration of immobile acceptors on the p side of the junction and ND is the
concentration of immobile donors on the n side of the junction. A depletion layer of immobile acceptors and
donors causes an electric ﬁeld E across the junction. For silicon, V0 is at room temperature T ¼ 300–K,
typically V0 ¼ 0.67 V for an abrupt junction with NA ¼ 1017 at/cm3 and ND ¼ 1015 at/cm3. The depletion layer
width is typically about 4 mm, and the electric ﬁeld E is about 60 kV/cm. Note the magnitude of the electric
ﬁeld across the junction.
pn-Junction with Applied Voltage
If the externally applied voltage VD to the diode is opposite to the barrier voltage V0, then pp in the Boltzmann
relation in Equation (1.21) is altered to
pp ¼ pn expðV0  VDÞ=VT
ð1:23Þ
This implies that the effective barrier voltage is reduced and the diffusion of carriers across the junction, is
increased. Accordingly the concentration of diffusing holes into the n-material is at x ¼ 0:
pnðx ¼ 0Þ ¼ pn exp VD=VT
ð1:24Þ
1-13
Semiconductors

and accordingly the concentration of electrons:
nnðx ¼ 0Þ ¼ nn exp VD=VT
ð1:25Þ
Most modern planar diodes are unsymmetrical. Figure 1.9 shows a pn-diode with the n region Wn much
shorter than the diffusion length Lpn of holes in the n-semiconductor region. This results in a linear
concentration gradient of injected diffusing holes in the n region given by
dp=dx ¼ ðpn exp VD=VT  pnÞ=Wn
ð1:26Þ
The diffusion gradient is negative since the concentration of positive holes decreases with distance due to the
hole–electron recombinations. The equation for the hole diffusion current is
Ip ¼ qAjDp dp=dx
ð1:27Þ
where Aj is the junction area, Dp is the diffusion constant for holes, and q is the elementary charge.
By combining of above equations we obtain
Ip ¼ ðqAjDppn=WnÞ ðexp VD=VT  1Þ
ð1:28Þ
In the p-semiconductor we assume that Lnp ,, Wp; then
dn=dx ¼ np expðVD=VT  1Þ
ð1:29Þ
By substituting this into the electron diffusion equation:
In ¼ qAjDndn=dx
ð1:30Þ
FIGURE 1.9
Planar diodes are fabricated in planar technology. Most modern diodes are unsymmetrical; thus Wn ,, Lpn.
The p-type region is more highly doped than the n region.

we obtain
In ¼ ðqAjDnnpÞ=Lnpðexp VD=VT  1Þ
ð1:31Þ
Thus, the total junction diffusion current is
ID ¼ Ip þ In ¼ fqAjDppn=Wn þ qAjDnnp=Lnpg ðexp VD=VT  1Þ
ð1:32Þ
Since the recombination of the injected carriers establishes a diffusion gradient, this in turn yields a ﬂow of
current proportional to the slope. For j  VDj .. VT, i.e., VD ¼  0.1 V:
IS ¼ ðqAiDppn=Wn þ qAiDnnp=LnpÞ
ð1:33Þ
Here, IS denotes the reverse saturation current. In practical junctions, the p region is usually much more
heavily doped than the n region; thus np ,, pn. Also, since Wn ,, Lnp in Equation (1.33), we obtain
IS ¼ qAjDppn=Wn ¼ qAjDpn2
i =WnND
ð1:34Þ
The reverse saturation current in short diodes is mainly determined by the diffusion constant Dp and the width
Wn of the n region, by intrinsic concentration ni, by the doping concentration ND in the n region, and by the
diode area Aj. (In reality, IS is also slightly dependent on the reverse voltage (Phillips, 1962).)
If VD is made positive, the exponential term in Equation (1.32) rapidly becomes larger than one; thus:
ID ¼ IS exp VD=VT
ð1:35Þ
where ID is the diode forward current and IS is the reverse saturation current.
Another mechanism predominates the reverse current IS in silicon. Because of the recombination centers in
the depletion region, a generation-recombination hole–electron current IG is generated in the depletion region
(Phillips, 1962; Sze, 1985):
IG ¼ KqAjeXd
ð1:36aÞ
Here, e is the generation rate unit volume, Aj is the junction area, q is the elementary charge, Xd is the
depletion layer thickness, and K is a dimensional constant. IG is proportional to the thickness Xd of the
depletion layer and to the junction area Aj. Since Xd increases with the square root of the reverse voltage, IG
increases accordingly, yielding a slight slope in the reverse I–V characteristic. The forward I–V characteristic of
the practical diode is only slightly affected (slope m ¼ 2) at very small forward currents (ID ¼ 1 nA to 1 mA).
In practical diodes n < 1 at small to medium currents (ID ¼ 1 mA to 10 mA). At large currents (ID . 10 mA),
m ¼ 1 to 2 due to the high current effects (Phillips, 1962) and due to the series bulk resistance of the diode.
The reverse current IR in silicon is voltage dependent. The predominant effect is the voltage dependence of
the generation-recombination current IG and to a smaller extent the voltage dependence of IS.
The total reverse current of the diode is thus equal to
IR ¼ IG þ IS
ð1:36bÞ
Forward-Biased Diode
For most practical applications:
ID ¼ IS exp VD=mVT
ð1:37Þ

where IS is the reverse saturation current (about 10  14 A for a
small-signal diode); VT ¼ kT/q is the thermal voltage equal to
26 mV

temperature;
k ¼ Boltzmann’s
constant,
1.38· 10  23 J/K; T is the absolute temperature in kelvin; q is
the elementary charge 1.602· 10  19 C; m is the ideality factor,
m ¼ 1 for medium currents, m ¼ 2 for very small and very large
currents; IS is part of the total reverse current IR of the diode
IR ¼ IS þ IG; and IS is the reverse saturation current and IG is
the generation-recombination current, also called diode leakage
current because IG is not a part of the carrier diffusion process in
the diode. ID is exponentially related to VD in Figure 1.10.
Temperature Dependence of VD
Equation (1.37) solved for VD yields
VD ¼ mVT lnðID=ISÞ
ð1:38Þ
at constant current ID, the diode voltage VD is temperature dependent because VT and IS are temperature
dependent. Assume m ¼ 1. The reverse saturation current IS from Equation (1.34) is
IS ¼ qAjn2
i Dp=WnND ¼ B1n2
i Dp ¼ B2n2
i mp
where Dp ¼ VTmp. mp ¼ B3T n and for n2
i :
n2
i ¼ B4Tg expðVG0=VTÞ
ð1:39Þ
where g ¼ 4 – n, and VG0 is the extrapolated bandgap energy (Gray and Meyer, 1993). With Equation (1.39)
into Equation (1.38), the derivative dVD/dT for ID ¼ const yields
dVD=dT ¼ ðVD  VG0Þ=T  gk=q
ð1:40Þ
At room temperature (T ¼ 300 K), and VD ¼ 0.65 V, VG0 ¼ 1.2 V, g ¼ 3, VT ¼ 26 mV, and k/q ¼ 86 mV/degree,
one gets dVD/dT < 2.1 mV/degree. The temperature coefﬁcient TC of VD is thus:
TC ¼ dVD=VD dT ¼ 1=T  VG0=VDT  gk=qVD
ð1:41Þ
For the above case TC < 0.32%/degree. In practical applications it is more convenient to use the expression:
VDðd2Þ ¼ VDðd1Þ  TCðd2  d1Þ
ð1:42Þ
where d1 and d2 are temperatures in degrees Celsius. For TC ¼  0.32%/degree and VD ¼ 0.65 V at d1 ¼ 27–C,
VD ¼ 0.618 V at d2 ¼ 37–C. Both dVD/dT and TC are ID dependent. At higher ID, both dVD/dT and TC are
smaller than at a lower ID, as shown in Figure 1.11.
ID–VD Characteristic
From the ID–VD characteristic of the diode one can ﬁnd for m ¼ 1:
ID1 ¼ IS expðVD1=VTÞ
and
ID2 ¼ IS expðVD2=VTÞ
ð1:43Þ
Thus, the ratio of currents is
ID2=ID1 ¼ expðVD2  VD1Þ=VT
ð1:44Þ
FIGURE 1.10

or the difference voltage:
VD2  VD1 ¼ VT lnðID2=ID1Þ
ð1:45Þ
in terms of base 10 logarithm:
VD2  VD1 ¼ VT 2:3 logðID2=ID1Þ
ð1:46Þ
For (ID2/ID1) ¼ 10 (one decade), VD2  VD1 ¼ ,60 mV, or VD2  VD1 ¼ 17.4 mV for (ID2/ID1) ¼ 2. In a typical
example, m ¼ 1, VD ¼ 0.67 V at ID ¼ 100 mA. At ID ¼ 200 mA, VD ¼ 0.67 V þ 17.4 mV ¼ 0.687 V.
DC and Large-Signal Model
The diode equation in Equation (1.37) is widely utilized in diode circuit design. IS and m can sometimes
be found from the data book or they can be determined from measured ID and VD. From two measurements of
ID and VD, for example, ID ¼ 0.2 mA at VD ¼ 0.670 V and ID ¼ 10 mA at VD ¼ 0.772 V, one can ﬁnd m ¼ 1.012
and IS ¼ 1.78· 10–15 A for the particular diode. A practical application of the large-signal diode model is
shown in Figure 1.13. Here, the current ID through the series resistor R and a diode D is to be found:
ID ¼ ðVCC  VDÞ=R
ð1:47Þ
FIGURE 1.11

FIGURE 1.13
Diode–resistor biasing circuit.
FIGURE 1.12
ID versus VD of a diode on a semi-
logarithmic plot.
1-17
Semiconductors

The equation is implicit and cannot be solved for ID since VD is a function of ID. Here, VD and ID are
determined by using iteration. By assuming VD ¼VD0 ¼ 0.6 V (cut-in voltage), the ﬁrst iteration yields
IDð1Þ ¼ ð5 V  0:6 VÞ=1 kOOOOO ¼ 4:4 mA
Next, the ﬁrst iteration voltage VD(1) is calculated (by using m and IS above and ID1 ¼ 4.4 mA); thus:
VDð1Þ ¼ mVT½ln IDð1Þ=IS	 ¼ 1:012 · 26 mV lnð4:4 mA=1:78 · 1015AÞ ¼ 0:751 V
From the second iteration ID(2) ¼ [VCC – VD(1)]/R ¼ 4.25 mA and thus VD(2) ¼ 0.75 V. The third iteration
yields ID(3) ¼ 4.25 mA, and VD(3) ¼ 0.75 V. These are the actual values of ID and VD for the above example,
since the second and the third iterations are almost equal.
Graphical analysis (in Figure 1.14) is another way to analyze the circuit in Figure 1.13. Here, the load line R
is drawn with the diode I–V characteristic, where VCC ¼ VD þ IDR. This type of analysis is illustrative but not
well suited for a numerical analysis.
High Forward Current Effects
In the pn-junction diode analysis it was assumed that the density of injected carriers from the p region into the
n region is small compared to the density of majority carriers in that region. Thus, all of the forward voltage
VD appears across the junction. Therefore, the injected carriers move only because of the diffusion. At high
forward currents this is not the case anymore. When the voltage drop across the bulk resistance becomes
comparable with the voltage across the junction, the effective applied voltage is reduced (Phillips, 1962).
Because of the electric ﬁeld created by the voltage drop in the bulk (neutral) regions, the current is not only a
diffusion current anymore. The drift current due to the voltage drop across the bulk region opposes the
diffusion current. The net effect is that, ﬁrst, the current becomes proportional to twice the diffusion constant,
second, the high-level current becomes independent of resistivity, and, third, the magnitude of the exponent is
reduced by a factor of two in Equation (1.37). The effect of high forward current on the I–V characteristic is
shown in Figure 1.15. In all practical designs, m < 2 at ID $ 20 mA in small-signal silicon diodes.
Large-Signal Piecewise Linear Model
Piecewise linear model of a diode is a very useful tool for quick circuit design containing diodes. Here, the
diode is represented by asymptotes and not by the exponential I–V curve. The simplest piecewise linear model
is shown in Figure 1.16(a). Here, Di is an ideal diode with VD ¼ 0 at ID $ 0, in series with VD0, where VD0 is
the diode cut-in or threshold voltage. The current in the diode will start to ﬂow at VD $ VD0.

resistor circuit.

forward currents.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

An improved model is shown in Figure 1.16(b), where VD0 is again the diode voltage at a very small current
ID0, rD is the extrapolated diode resistance, and ID1 is the diode current in operating point 1. Thus, the diode
voltage is
VD1 ¼ VD0 þ ID1rD
ð1:48Þ
where VD1 is the diode voltage at ID1. VD0 for silicon is about 0.60 V. rD is estimated from the fact that VD in a
real diode is changing per decade of current by m 2.3 VT. Thus, VD changes about 60 mV for a decade change
of current ID at m ¼ 1. Thus, in a 0.1 to 10 mA current change, VD changes about 120 mV, which corresponds
to anrD < 120 mV/10 mA ¼ 12 OOOOO.
The foregoing method is an approximation; however, it is quite practical for ﬁrst-hand calculations. To
compare this with the above iterative approach let us assume m ¼ 1, VD0 ¼ 0.60 V, rD ¼ 12 OOOOO, VCC ¼ 5 V,
R ¼ 1 kOOOOO. The current ID1 ¼ [VCC  VD0]/(R þ rD) ¼ 4.34 mA compared with ID1 ¼ 4.25 mA in the iterative
approach.
Small-Signal Incremental Model
In the small-signal incremental model, the diode is represented by linear elements. In small-signal
(incremental) analysis, the diode voltage signals are assumed to be about VT/2 or less, thus much smaller than
the dc voltage VD across the diode. In the forward-biased diode, three elements are of practical interest:
incremental resistance (or small-signal or differential resistance) rd, the diffusion capacitance Cd, and the
junction capacitance Cj.
Incremental Resistance, rd
For small signals the diode represents a small-signal resistance (often
called incremental or differential resistance) rd in the operating point
(ID,VD) where
rd ¼ dVD=dID ¼ mVT=IS expðVD=mVTÞ ¼ mVT=ID
ð1:49Þ
In Figure 1.17, rd is shown as the tangent in the dc operating point
(VD, ID). Note that rd is independent of the geometry of the device and
inversely proportional to the diode dc current. Thus, for ID ¼ 1 mA,
m ¼ 1 and VT ¼ 26 mV, the incremental resistance is rd ¼ 26 OOOOO.

mental resistance rd of a diode.

cut-in voltage VD0 is deﬁned as the voltage VD at a very small current ID typically at about 1 nA. For silicon diodes this
voltage is typically VD0 ¼ 0.6 V.

Diffusion Capacitance, Cd
Cd is associated with the injection of holes and electrons in the forward-biased diode. In steady state, holes and
electrons are injected across the junction. Hole and electron currents ﬂow due to the diffusion gradients on
both sides of the junction in Figure 1.18. In a short diode, holes are traveling a distance Wn ,, Lpn. For
injected holes, and since Wn ,, Lpn:
Ip ¼ dqp=dt ¼ dqpv=dx
ð1:50Þ
where v is the average carrier velocity, Dp is the diffusion constant for holes and Wn is the travel distance of
holes. By integrating of Equation (1.50) one gets
Ip
ZWn

dx ¼ v
ZQp
0 dqp
and the charge Qp of holes becomes
Qp ¼ IpWn=v ¼ Iptp
ð1:51Þ
tp ¼ Wn/v is the transit time holes travel the distance Wn. Similarly, for electron charge Qn, since Wp .. Lnp:
Qn ¼ InLnp=v ¼ Intn
ð1:52Þ
Thus the total diffusion charge Qd is
Qd ¼ Qp þ Qn
ð1:53Þ
and the total transit time is
tF ¼ tp þ tn
ð1:54Þ
and with Ip þ In ¼ ID ¼ IS exp VD/mVT and Equation (1.51), Equation (1.52), and Equation (1.54) one gets
Qd ¼ tFIS exp VD=mVT ¼ tFID

and from Equation (1.55) and Equation (1.56):
Cd ¼ IDtF=mVT
ð1:57Þ
Cd is thus directly proportional to ID and to the carrier transit time tF. For an unsymmetrical diode with
Wn ,, Lpn and NA .. ND (Gray and Meyer, 1984):
tF < W2

ð1:58Þ
tF is usually given in data books or it can be measured.
For Wn ¼ 6 m and Dp ¼ 14 cm2/s, tF < 13 ns, ID ¼ 1 mA, VT ¼ 26 mV, and m ¼ 1, the diffusion capacitance is
Cd ¼ 500 pF.
Depletion Capacitance, Cj
The depletion region is always present in a pn-diode. Because of the immobile ions in the depletion region, the
junction acts as a voltage-dependent plate capacitor Cj (Horenstein, 1990; Gray and Meyer, 1993):
Cj ¼ Cj0=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
V0  VD
p
ð1:59Þ
VD is the diode voltage (positive value for forward biasing, negative value for reverse biasing), and Cj0 is the
zero bias depletion capacitance; Aj is the junction diode area:
Cj0 ¼ KAj
ð1:60Þ
K is a proportionality constant dependent on diode doping, and Aj is the diode area. Cj is voltage dependent.
As VD increases, Cj increases in a forward-biased diode in Figure 1.19. For V0 ¼ 0.7 V, VD ¼  10 V and
Cj0 ¼ 3 pF, the diode depletion capacitance is Cj ¼ 0.75 pF. In Figure 1.20 the small-signal model of the diode is
shown. The total small-signal time constant td is thus (by neglecting the bulk series diode resistance RBB):
td ¼ rdðCd þ CjÞ ¼ rdCd þ rdCj ¼ tF þ rdCj
ð1:61Þ
td is thus current dependent. At small ID the rdCj product is predominant. For high-speed operation rdCj must
be kept much smaller than tF. This is achieved by a large operating current ID. The diode behaves to a ﬁrst
approximation as a frequency-dependent element. In the reverse operation, the diode behaves as a high ohmic
resistor Rp < VR/IG in parallel with the capacitor Cj. In forward small-signal operation, the diode behaves as a
resistor rd in parallel with the capacitors Cj and Cd (Rp is neglected). Thus, the diode is in a ﬁrst approxi-
mation, a low-pass network.

Large-Signal Switching Behavior of a pn-Diode
When a forward-biased diode is switched from the forward into the reverse direction, the stored charge Qd of
minority carriers must ﬁrst be removed. The charge of minority carriers in the forward-biased unsymmetrical
diode is from Equation (1.55) and Equation (1.58):
Qd ¼ IDtF ¼ IDW2
n=2Dp
ð1:62Þ
where Wn ,, Lpn is assumed. tF is minimized by making Wn very small. Very low-lifetime tF is required
for high-speed diodes. Carrier lifetime tF is reduced by adding a large concentration of recombination
centers into the junction. This is common practice in the fabrication of high-speed computer diodes (Phillips,
1962). The charge Qd is stored mainly in the n region in the form of a concentration gradient of holes in
Figure 1.21(a). The diode is turned off by moving the switch from position (a) into position (b)
(Figure 1.21(a)). The removal of carriers is done in three time intervals. During the time interval t1, also called
the recovery phase, a constant reverse current jIRj ¼VR/R ﬂows in the diode. During the time interval t2  t1
the charge in the diode is reduced by about 1/2 of the original charge. During the third interval t3  t2, the
residual charge is removed.

If during the interval t1, jIRj .. ID, then Qd is reduced only by ﬂow of reverse diffusion current; no holes
arrive at the metal contact (Gugenbuehl et al., 1962), and
t1 < tFðID=jIRjÞ2

During time interval t2  t1, when jIRj ¼ ID, in Figure 1.21(b):

The residual charge is removed during the time t3  t2 < 0.5 tF.
Diode Reverse Breakdown
Avalanche breakdown occurs in a reverse-biased plane junction when
the critical electric ﬁeld Ecrt at the junction within the depletion region
reaches about 3· 105 V/cm for junction doping densities of about 1015 to
1016 at/cm3 (Gray and Meyer, 1984). At this electric ﬁeld Ecrt, the
minority carriers traveling (as reverse current) in the depletion region
acquire sufﬁcient energy to create new hole–electron pairs in collision
with atoms. These energetic pairs are able to create new pairs, etc. This
process is called the avalanche process and leads to a sudden increase of
the reverse current IR in a diode. The current is then limited only by the
external circuitry. The avalanche current is not destructive as long as the
local junction temperature does not create local hot spots, i.e., melting of
material at the junction. Figure 1.22 shows a typical I–V characteristic
for a junction diode in the avalanche breakdown. The effect of
breakdown is seen by the large increase of the reverse current IR when VR reaches – BV. Here, BV is the
actual breakdown voltage. It was found that IRA ¼ M IR, where IRA is the avalanche reverse current at BV, M is
the multiplication factor, and IR is the reverse current not in the breakdown region. M is deﬁned as
M ¼ 1=½1  VR=BV	n
ð1:65Þ
where n ¼ 3 to 6. As VR ¼ BV, M ! 1 and IRA ! 1. The above BV is valid for a strictly plane junction without
any curvature. However, in a real planar diode as shown in Figure 1.9, the p-diffusion has a curvature with a
ﬁnite radius xj. If the diode is doped unsymmetrically, thus sp .. sn, then the depletion area penetrates
mostly into the n region. Because of the ﬁnite radius, the breakdown occurs at the radius xj, rather than in a
plane junction (Grove, 1967). The breakdown voltage is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the curvature. In very
shallow planar diodes, the avalanche breakdown voltage BV can be much smaller than 10 V.
Zener and Avalanche Diodes
Zener diodes (ZD) and avalanche diodes are pn-diodes specially built to operate in reverse breakdown. They
operate in the reverse direction; however, their operating mechanism is different. In a Zener diode the hole–
electron pairs are generated by the electric ﬁeld by direct transition of carriers from valence band into the
conductance band. In an avalanche diode, the hole–electron pairs are generated by impact ionization due to
high-energy holes and electrons.
Avalanche and Zener diodes are extensively used as voltage regulators and as overvoltage protection
devices. TC of Zener diodes is negative at VZ # 3.5 to 4.5 V and is equal to zero at about VZ < 5 V. TC of a
Zener diode operating above 5 V is in general positive. Above 10 V the pn-diodes operate as avalanche diodes
with a strong positive temperature coefﬁcient. The TC of a Zener diode is more predictable than that of
the avalanche diode. Temperature-compensated Zener diodes utilize the positive TC of a 7-V Zener diode,
FIGURE 1.22

which is compensated with a series-connected forward-biased diode with a negative TC. The disadvantage of
Zener diodes is a relatively large electronic noise.
Varactor Diodes
The varactordiode is an ordinary pn-diode that usesthe voltage-dependent variable capacitance of thediode. The
varactor diode is widely used as a voltage-dependent capacitor in electronically tuned radio receivers and in TV.
Tunnel Diodes
The tunnel diode is an ordinary pn-junction diode with very heavy doped n and p regions. Because the
junction is very thin, a tunnel effect takes place. An electron can tunnel through the thin depletion layer from
the conduction band of the n region directly into the valence band of the p region. Tunnel diodes create a
negative differential resistance in the forward direction due to the tunnel effect. Tunnel diodes are used as
mixers, oscillators, ampliﬁers, and detectors. They operate at very high frequencies in the gigahertz bands.
Photodiodes and Solar Cells
Photodiodes are ordinary pn-diodes that generate hole–electron pairs when exposed to light. A photocurrent
ﬂows across the junction, if the diode is reverse biased. Silicon pn-junctions are used to sense light at near-
infrared and visible spectra around 0.9 mm. Other materials are used for different spectra.
Solar cells utilize the pn-junction to convert light energy into electrical energy. Hole–electron pairs are
generated in the semiconductor material by light photons. The carriers are separated by the high electric ﬁeld
in the depletion region across the pn-junction.The electric ﬁeld forces the holes into the p region and the
electrons into the n region. This displacement of mobile charges creates a voltage difference between the two
semiconductor regions. Electric power is generated in an external load connected between the terminals to the
p and n regions. The conversion efﬁciency is relatively low, around 10 to 12%. With the use of new materials,
an efﬁciency of about 30% has been reported. Efﬁciency up to 45% was achieved by using monochromatic light.
Schottky Barrier Diode
The Schottky barrier diode is a metal-semiconductor diode. Majority carriers carry the electric current. No
minority carrier injection takes place. When the diode is forward biased, carriers are injected into the metal,
where they reside as majority carriers at an energy level that is higher than the Fermi level in metals. The I–V
characteristic is similar to conventional diodes. The barrier voltage is small, about 0.2 V for silicon. Since no
minority carrier charge exists, the Schottky barrier diodes are very fast. They are used in high-speed electronic
circuitry.

Electrical Equivalent Circuit Models and Device
Simulators for Semiconductor Devices
Aicha Elshabini-Riad, F.W. Stephenson, and Imran A. Bhutta
In the past 15 years, the electronics industry has seen a tremendous surge in the development of new
semiconductor materials, novel devices, and circuits. For the designer to bring these circuits or devices to the
market in a timely fashion, he or she must have design tools capable of predicting the device behavior in a
variety of circuit conﬁgurations and environmental conditions. Equivalent circuit models and semiconductor
device simulators represent such design tools.
Overview of Equivalent Circuit Models
Circuit analysis is an important tool in circuit design. It saves considerable time at the circuit design stage by
providing the designer with a tool for predicting the circuit behavior without actually processing the circuit.
An electronic circuit usually contains active devices, in addition to passive components. While the current
and voltage behavior of passive devices is deﬁned by simple relationships, the equivalent relationships in active
devices are quite complicated in nature. Therefore, in order to analyze an active circuit, the devices are
replaced by equivalent circuit models that give the same output characteristics as the active device itself. These
models are made up of passive elements, voltage sources, and current sources. Equivalent circuit models
provide the designer with reasonably accurate values for frequencies below 1 GHz for bipolar junction
transistors (BJTs), and their use is quite popular in circuit analysis software. Some ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET)
models are accurate up to 10 GHz. As the analysis frequency increases, however, so does the model complexity.
Since the equivalent circuit models are based on some fundamental equations describing the device behavior,
they can also be used to predict the characteristics of the device itself.
When performing circuit analysis, two important factors that must be taken into account are the speed and
accuracy of computation. Sometimes, the computation speed can be considerably improved by simplifying the
equivalent circuit model, without signiﬁcant loss in computation accuracy. For this reason, there are a number
of equivalent circuit models, depending on the device application and related conditions. Equivalent circuit
models have been developed for diodes, BJTs, and FETs. In this overview, the equivalent circuit models for BJT
and FET devices are presented.
Most of the equivalent circuits for BJTs are based on the Ebers–Moll model (Ebers and Moll, 1954) or the
Gummel–Poon model (Gummeland Poon, 1970).The original Ebers–Mollmodelwasa largesignal, nonlineardc
model for BJTs. Since then, a number of improvements have been incorporated to make the model more accurate
for various applications. In addition, an accurate model has been introduced by Gummel and Poon (1970).
There are three main types of equivalent circuit models, depending on the device signal strength. On this
basis, the models can be classiﬁed as follows:
1. Large-signal equivalent circuit model
2. Small-signal equivalent circuit model
3. DC equivalent circuit model
Use of the large-signal or small-signal model depends on the magnitude of the driving source. In
applications where the driving currents or the driving voltages have large amplitudes, large-signal models are
used. In circuits where the signal does not deviate much from the dc biasing point, small-signal models are
more suitable. For dc conditions and very-low-frequency applications, dc equivalent circuit models are used.
For dc and very-low-frequency analysis, the circuit element values can be assumed to be lumped, whereas in
high-frequency analysis, incremental element values give much more precise results.
Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model
Depending on the frequency of operation, large-signal equivalent circuit models can be further classiﬁed as
(1) high-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model and (2) low-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit
model.

High-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
In this context, high-frequency
denotes frequencies above 10 kHz. In the equivalent circuit model, the transistor is assumed to be composed of
two back-to-back diodes. Two current-dependent current sources are added to model the current ﬂowing
through the reverse-biased base–collector junction and the forward-biased base–emitter junction. Two junction
capacitances, CE and CjC, model the ﬁxed charges in the emitter–base space charge region and base–collector
space charge region, respectively. Two diffusion capacitances, CDE and CDC, model the corresponding charge
associated with mobile carriers, while the base resistance, rb, represents the voltage drop in the base region. All the
above circuit elements are very strong functions of operating frequency, signal strength, and bias voltage.
The high-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model of an npn BJT is shown in Figure 1.23, where the
capacitances CjE, CjC, CDE, CDC are deﬁned as follows:
CjEðVB0E0Þ ¼

fC

mC
ð1:67Þ
CDE ¼ tFICC
VB0E0
ð1:68Þ
and
CDC ¼ tRIEC
VB0E0
ð1:69Þ
In these equations, VB0E0 is the internal base–emitter voltage, CjEO is the base–emitter junction capacitance at
VB0E0 ¼ 0, fE is the base–emitter barrier potential, and mE is the base–emitter capacitance gradient factor.
Similarly, VB0C0 is the internal base–collector voltage, CjCO is the base–collector junction capacitance at
VB0C0 ¼ 0, fC is the base–collector barrier potential, and mC is the base–collector capacitance gradient factor.
ICC and IEC denote the collector and emitter reference currents, respectively, while tF is the total forward
transit time, and tR is the total reverse transit time. aR and aF are the large-signal reverse and forward current
gains of a common base transistor, respectively.
This circuit can be made linear by replacing the forward-biased base–emitter diode with a low-value
resistor, rp, while the reverse-biased base–collector diode is replaced with a high-value resistor, rm. The junction
and diffusion capacitors are lumped together to form Cp and Cm, while the two current sources are lumped

into one source (gmFVF

gmRVR), where gmF and gmR are the transistor forward and reverse
transconductances, respectively. VF and VR are the voltages across the forward- and reverse-biased diodes,
represented by rp and rm, respectively. rp is typically about 3 kOOOOO, while rm is more than a few megohms, and Cp
is about 120 pF. The linear circuit representation is illustrated in Figure 1.24.
The Gummel–Poon representation is very similar to the high-frequency large-signal linear circuit model of
Figure 1.24. However, the terms describing the elements are different and a little more involved.
High-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET.
In the high-frequency large-
signal equivalent circuit model of a FET, the ﬁxed charge stored between the gate and the source and between
the gate and the drain is modeled by the gate-to-source and the gate-to-drain capacitances, CGS and CGD,
respectively. The mobile charges between the drain and the source are modeled by the drain-to-source
capacitance, CDS. The voltage drop through the active channel is modeled by the drain-to-source resistance,
RDS. The current through the channel is modeled by a voltage-controlled current source. For large signals, the
gate is sometimes driven into the forward region, and thus the conductance through the gate is modeled by the
gate conductance, Gg. The conductance from the gate to the drain and from the gate to the source is modeled
by the gate-to-drain and gate-to-source resistances, RGD and RGS, respectively. A variable resistor, Ri, is added
to model the gate charging time such that the time constant given by RiCGS holds the following relationship:
RiCGS ¼ constant
ð1:70Þ
For MOSFETs, typical element values are: CGS and CGD are in the range of 1 to 10 pF, CDS is in the range of
0.1 to 1 pF, RDS is in the range of 1 to 50 kOOOOO, RGD is more than 1014 OOOOO, RGS is more than 1010 OOOOO, and gm is in
the range of 0.1 to 20 mA/V.

Low-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
In this case, low frequency
denotes frequencies below 10 kHz. The low-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model of a BJT is based
on its dc characteristics. Whereas at high frequencies one has to take incremental values to obtain accurate
analysis, at low frequencies, the average of these incremental values yields the same level of accuracy in the
analysis. Therefore, in low-frequency analysis, the circuit elements of the high-frequency model are replaced by
their average values. The low-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Figure 1.26.
Low-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET.
Because of their high reactance
values, the gate-to-source, gate-to-drain, and drain-to-source capacitances can be assumed to be open circuits
at low frequencies. Therefore, the low-frequency large-signal model is similar to the high-frequency large-
signal model, except that it has no capacitances. The resulting circuit describing low-frequency operation is
shown in Figure 1.27.
Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model
In a small-signal equivalent circuit model, the signal variations around the dc-bias operating point are very
small. Just as for the large-signal model, there are two types of small-signal models, depending upon the
operating frequency: (1) the high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model and (2) the low-frequency
small-signal equivalent circuit model.
High-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
The high-frequency small-signal
equivalent circuit model of a BJT is quite similar to its high-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model. In
the small-signal model, however, in addition to the base resistance rb, the emitter and collector resistances, re
and rc, respectively, are added to the circuit. The emitter resistance is usually very small because of high emitter
doping used to obtain better emitter injection efﬁciency. Therefore, whereas at large signal strengths the
effect of re is overshadowed by the base resistance, at small signal strengths this emitter resistance cannot

FIGURE 1.26

Semiconductors

be neglected. The collector resistance becomes important in the linear region, where the collector–emitter
voltage is low. The high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Figure 1.28.
High-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET.
For small-signal operations, the
signal strength is not large enough to forward bias the gate-to-semiconductor diode; hence, no current will
ﬂow from the gate to either the drain or the source. Therefore, the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain series
resistances, RGS and RGD, can be neglected. Also, since there will be no current ﬂow from the gate to the
channel, the gate conductance, Gg, can also be neglected. Figure 1.29 illustrates the high-frequency small-signal
equivalent circuit model of a FET.
Low-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
As in the low-frequency large-
signal model, the junction capacitances, CjC and CjE, and the diffusion capacitances, CDE and CDC, can be
neglected. Furthermore, the base resistance, rb, can also be neglected, because the voltage drop across the base
is not signiﬁcant and the variations in the base width caused by changes in the collector–base voltage are also
very small. The low-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Figure 1.30.

Low-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET.
Because the reactances associated
with all the capacitances are very high, one can neglect the capacitances for low-frequency analysis. The gate
conductance as well as the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain resistances can also be neglected in small-signal
operation. The resulting low-frequency equivalent circuit model of a FET is shown in Figure 1.31.
DC Equivalent Circuit Model
DC Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.
The dc equivalent circuit model of a BJT is based on the
original Ebers–Moll model. Such models are used when the transistor is operated at dc or in applications
where the operating frequency is below 1 kHz.
There are two versions of the dc equivalent circuit model—the injection version and the transport version.
The difference between the two versions lies in the choice of the reference current. In the injection version, the
reference currents are IF and IR, the forward- and reverse-biased diode currents, respectively. In the transport
version, the reference currents are the collector transport current, ICC, and the emitter transport current, ICE.
These currents are of the form:
IF ¼ IES exp qVBE

and

ð1:74Þ
In these equations, IES and ICS are the base–emitter saturation current and the base–collector saturation
current, respectively. IS denotes the saturation current.
In most computer simulations, the transport version is usually preferred because of the following conditions:
1. ICC and IEC are ideal over many decades.
2. IS can specify both reference currents at any given voltage.
The dc equivalent circuit model of a BJT is shown in Figure 1.32.

DC Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET.
In the dc equivalent circuit model of a FET, the gate is
considered isolated because the gate–semiconductor interface is formed as a reverse-biased diode and
therefore is open circuited. All capacitances are also assumed to represent open circuits. RGS, RGD, and RDS are
neglected because there is no conductance through the gate and, because this is a dc analysis, there are no
charging effects associated with the gate. The dc equivalent circuit of a FET is illustrated in Figure 1.33.
Commercially Available Packages
A number of circuit analysis software packages are commercially available, one of the most widely used being
SPICE. In this package, the BJT models are a combination of the Gummel–Poon and the modiﬁed Ebers–Moll
models. Figure 1.34 shows a common emitter transistor circuit and a SPICE input ﬁle containing the transistor
model. Some other available packages are SLIC, SINC, SITCAP, and Saber.
Equivalent circuit models are basically used to replace the semiconductor device in an electronic circuit.
These models are developed from an understanding of the device’s current and voltage behavior for novel
devices where internal device operation is not well understood. For such situations, the designer has another
tool available, the semiconductor device simulator.
Overview of Semiconductor Device Simulators
Device simulators are based on the physics of semiconductor devices. The input to the simulator takes the
form of information about the device under consideration such as material type, device, dimensions, doping
concentrations, and operating conditions. Based on this information, the device simulator computes the
electric ﬁeld inside the device and thus predicts carrier concentrations in the different regions of the device.
Device simulators can also predict transient behavior, including quantities such as current–voltage
characteristics and frequency bandwidth. The three basic approaches to device simulation are (1) the
classical approach, (2) the semiclassical approach, and (3) the quantum mechanical approach.

Device Simulators Based on the Classical Approach
The classical approach is based on the solution of Poisson’s equation and the current continuity equations.
The current consists of the drift and the diffusion current components.
Assumptions.
The equations for the classical approach can be obtained by making the following
approximations to the Boltzmann transport equation:
1. Carrier temperature is the same throughout the device and is assumed to be equal to the lattice
temperature.
2. Quasi steady-state conditions exist.
3. Carrier mean free path must be smaller than the distance over which the quasi-Fermi level is changing
by kT/q.
4. The impurity concentration is constant or varies very slowly along the mean free path of the carrier.
5. The energy band is parabolic.
6. The inﬂuence of the boundary conditions is negligible.
For general purposes, even with these assumptions and limitations, the models based on the classical
approach give fairly accurate results. The model assumes that the driving force for the carriers is the quasi-Fermi
potential gradient, which is also dependent upon the electric ﬁeld value. Therefore, in some simulators, the
quasi-Fermi level distributions are computed and the carrier distribution is estimated from this information.
Equations to be Solved.
With the assumption of a quasi-steady-state condition, the operating wavelength
is much larger than the device dimensions. Hence, Maxwell’s equations can be reduced to the more familiar
Poisson’s equation:
H2c ¼  r
E
ð1:75Þ

and, for a nonhomogeneous medium:
H · EðHcÞ ¼ r
ð1:76Þ
where c denotes the potential of the region under simulation, E denotes the permittivity, and r denotes the
charge enclosed by this region.
Also from Maxwell’s equations, one can determine the current continuity equations for a homogeneous
medium as:
H · Jn  q qn

ð1:77Þ
where
Jn  qmnE þ qDnH · n

and
H · Jp þ q qp
qt


¼  qU
ð1:79Þ
where
Jp ¼ qmppE  qDpH · p
ð1:80Þ
For nonhomogeneous media, the electric ﬁeld term in the current expressions is modiﬁed to account for the
nonuniform density of states and the bandgap variation (Lundstrom and Schuelke, 1983).
In the classical approach, the objective is to calculate the potential and the carrier distribution inside the
device. Poisson’s equation is solved to yield the potential distribution inside the device from which the electric
ﬁeld can be approximated. The electric ﬁeld distribution is then used in the current continuity equations to
obtain the carrier distribution and the current densities. The diffusion coefﬁcients and carrier mobilities are
usually ﬁeld as well as spatially dependent.
The generation-recombination term U is usually speciﬁed by the Shockley–Read–Hall relationship (Yoshi
et al., 1982):
Rn ¼
pn  n2
ie
tpðn þ ntÞ þ tnð p þ ptÞ
ð1:81Þ
where p and n are the hole and electron concentrations, respectively, nie is the effective intrinsic carrier density,
tp and tn are the hole and electron lifetimes, and pt and nt are the hole and electron trap densities, respectively.
The electron and hole mobilities are usually speciﬁed by the Scharfetter–Gummel empirical formula, as
m ¼ m0 1 þ
N
ðN=aÞ þ b þ
ðE=cÞ2
ðE=cÞ þ d þ ðE=eÞ2

where N is the total ionized impurity concentration, E is the electric ﬁeld, and a, b, c, d, and e are deﬁned
constants (Scharfetter and Gummel, 1969) that have different values for electrons and holes.
Boundary Conditions.
Boundary conditions have a large effect on the ﬁnal solution, and their speciﬁc
choice is a very important issue. For ohmic contacts, inﬁnite recombination velocities and space charge

neutrality conditions are assumed. Therefore, for a p-type material, the ohmic boundary conditions take
the form:

where Vappl is the applied voltage, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and Nþ

For Schottky contacts, the boundary conditions take the form:

where EG is the semiconductor bandgap and fB is the barrier potential. For other boundaries with no current
ﬂow across them, the boundary conditions are of the form:
qc
qn ¼ qjjn
qn ¼ qjp
qp ¼ 0
ð1:88Þ
where fn and fp are the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels, respectively.
For ﬁeld-effect devices, the potential under the gate may be obtained either by setting the gradient of the
potential near the semiconductor–oxide interface equal to the gradient of potential inside the oxide (Kasai
et al., 1982), or by solving Laplace’s equation in the oxide layer, or by assuming a Dirichlet boundary condition
at the oxide–gate interface and determining the potential at the semiconductor–oxide interface as:
ESi

ð1:89Þ
where ESi and EOx are the permittivities of silicon and the oxide, respectively, cG is the potential at the top of
the gate, cS*ðx; zÞ is the potential of the gate near the interface, and T(z) is the thickness of the gate metal.
Solution Methods.
Two of the most popular methods of solving the above equations are ﬁnite difference
method (FDM) and ﬁnite element method (FEM).
In FDM, the region under simulation is divided into rectangular or triangular areas for two-dimensional
cases or into cubic or tetrahedron volumes in three-dimensional cases. Each corner or vertex is considered as
1-35
Semiconductors

a node. The differential equations are modiﬁed using ﬁnite difference approximations, and a set of equations is
constructed in matrix form. The ﬁnite difference equations are solved iteratively at only these nodes. The most
commonly used solvers are Gauss–Seidel/Jacobi (G-S/J) techniques or Newton’s technique (NT) (Banks et al.,
1983). FDM has the disadvantage of requiring more nodes than the FEM for the same structure. A new
variation of FDM, namely the ﬁnite boxes scheme (Franz et al., 1983), however, overcomes this problem by
enabling local area reﬁnement. The advantage of FDM is that its computational memory requirement is less
than that required for FEM because of the band structure of the matrix.
In FEM, the region under simulation is divided into triangular and quadrilateral regions in two dimensions
or into tetrahedra in three dimensions. The regions are placed to have the maximum number of vertices in
areas where there is expected to be a large variation of composition or a large variation in the solution.
The equations in FEM are modiﬁed by multiplying them with some shape function and integrating over the
simulated region. In triangular meshes, the shape function is dependent on the area of the triangle and the
spatial location of the node. The value of the spatial function is between 0 and 1. The solution at one node is
the sum of all the solutions, resulting from the nearby nodes, multiplied by their respective shape functions.
The number of nodes required to simulate a region is less than that in FDM; however, the memory
requirement is greater.
Device Simulators Based on the Semiclassical Approach

where f represents the carrier distribution in the volume under consideration at any time t, v is the group
velocity, E is the electric ﬁeld, and q and h are the electronic charge and Planck’s constant, respectively.
BTE is a simpliﬁed form of the Liouville–Von Neumann equation for the density matrix. In this approach,
the free ﬂight between two consecutive collisions of the carrier is considered to be under the inﬂuence of the
electric ﬁeld, whereas different scattering mechanisms determine how and when the carrier will undergo a
collision.
Assumptions.
The assumptions for the semiclassical model can be summarized as follows:
1. Carrier-to-carrier interactions are considered to be very weak.
2. Particles cannot gain energy from the electric ﬁeld during collision.
3. Scattering probability is independent of the electric ﬁeld.
4. Magnetic ﬁeld effects are neglected.
5. No electron-to-electron interaction occurs in the collision term.
6. Electric ﬁeld varies very slowly, i.e., electric ﬁeld is considered constant for a wave packet describing the
particle’s motion.
7. The electron and hole gas is not degenerate.
8. Band theory and effective-mass theorems apply to the semiconductor.
Equations to Be Solved.
As a starting point, Poisson’s equation is solved to obtain the electric ﬁeld inside
the device. Using the Monte-Carlo technique (MCT), the BTE is solved to obtain the carrier distribution
function, f. In the MCT, the path of one or more carriers, under the inﬂuence of external forces, is followed,
and from this information the carrier distribution function is determined. BTE can also be solved by the
momentum and energy balance equations.
The carrier distribution function gives the carrier concentrations in the different regions of the device and
can also be used to obtain the electron and hole currents, using the following expressions:

Device Simulators Based on the Quantum Mechanical Approach
The quantum mechanical approach is based on the solution of the Schrodinger wave equation (SWE), which,
in its time-independent form, can be represented as
ðh=2pÞ2
2m
H2jn þ ðEn þ qVÞjn ¼ 0
ð1:93Þ
where jn is the wave function corresponding to the subband n whose minimum energy is En, V is the potential
of the region, m is the particle mass, and h and q are Planck’s constant and the electronic charge, respectively.
Equations to Be Solved.
In this approach, the potential distribution inside the device is calculated using
Poisson’s equation. This potential distribution is then used in the SWE to yield the electron wave vector, which
in turn is used to calculate the carrier distribution, using the following expression:
n ¼
X
n
Nnjjnj2
ð1:94Þ
where n is the electron concentration and Nn is the concentration of the subband n.
This carrier concentration is again used in Poisson’s equation, and new values of jn, En, and n are
calculated. This process is repeated until a self-consistent solution is obtained. The ﬁnal wave vector is invoked
to determine the scattering matrix, after which MCT is used to yield the carrier distribution and current
densities.
Commercially Available Device Simulation Packages
The classical approach is the most commonly used procedure since it is the easiest to implement and, in most
cases, the fastest technique. Simulators based on the classical approach are available in two-dimensional forms
like FEDAS, HESPER, PISCES-II, PISCES-2B, MINIMOS, and BAMBI, or three-dimensional forms like
TRANAL, SIERRA, FIELDAY, DAVINCI, and CADDETH.
Large-dimension a devices, where the carriers travel far from the boundaries, can be simulated based on a
one-dimensional approach. Most currently used devices, however, do not ﬁt into this category, and therefore
one has to resort to either two- or three-dimensional simulators.
FEDAS (Field Effect Device Analysis System) is a two-dimensional device simulator that simulates
MOSFETs, JFETs, and MESFETs by considering only those carriers that form the channel. The Poisson
equation is solved everywhere except in the oxide region. Instead of carrying the potential calculation within
the oxide region, the potential at the semiconductor–oxide interface is calculated by assuming a mixed
boundary condition. FEDAS uses FDM to solve the set of linear equations. A three-dimensional variation of
FEDAS is available for the simulation of small geometry MOSFETs.
HESPER (HEterostructure device Simulation Program to Estimate the performance Rigorously) is a two-
dimensional device simulator that can be used to simulate heterostructure photodiodes, HBTs, and HEMTs.
The simulation starts with the solution of Poisson’s equation in which the electron and hole concentrations are
described as functions of the composition (composition dependent). The recombination rate is given by the
Shockley–Read–Hall relationship. Lifetimes of both types of carriers are assumed to be equal in this model.
PISCES-2B is a two-dimensional device simulator for simulation of diodes, BJTs, MOSFETs, JFETs, and
MESFETs. Besides steady-state analysis, transient and ac small-signal analysis can also be performed.

Conclusion
The decision to use an equivalent circuit model or a device simulator depends upon the designer and the
required accuracy of prediction. To save computational time, one should use as simple a model as accuracy
will allow. At this time, however, the trend is toward developing quantum mechanical models that are more
accurate, and with faster computers available, the computational time for these simulators has been
considerably reduced.

Processes
Harold G. Parks
Integrated circuit (IC) fabrication consists of a sequence of processing steps referred to as unit-step processes
that lead to the devices present on today’s microchips. These unit-step processes provide the methodology for
introducing and transporting dopants to change the conductivity of the semiconductor substrate, growing
thermal oxides for inter- and intra-level isolation, depositing insulating and conducting ﬁlms, and patterning
and etching the various layers in formation of the IC. Many of these unit steps have remained essentially the
same since discrete component processing. However, others have originated and grown with the evolution of
integrated circuits from large-scale integration (LSI) with thousands of components per chip in the late 1970s
through to the ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) era of today, with billions of devices per chip. As
technology continues to evolve into the nanometer regime, further modiﬁcation of current unit-step processes
will be required. In this section, the unit-step processes for silicon IC processing as they exist today are
presented, with an eye toward the future. How they are combined to form the actual IC process will be
discussed in a later section. Because of space limitations, only silicon processes will be discussed. This is not a
major limitation, as many of the same steps are used to process other types of semiconductors, and perhaps
more than 98% of all ICs today and in the near future are and will be made of silicon. Furthermore, only the
highlights of the unit steps can be presented in this space, but ample references are provided for a more
thorough presentation. The referenced processing textbooks provide a detailed discussion of all processes.

Thermal Oxidation
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) layers are important in integrated-circuit technology for surface passivation as both a
diffusion barrier and a surface dielectric. The fact that silicon readily forms a high-quality, dense, natural oxide
is the major reason it is dominant in integrated-circuit technology today. If a silicon wafer is exposed to air, it
will grow a thin ( < 20 A˚ ) oxide layer in a relatively short time period. To achieve the thickness required for
SiO2 layers used in integrated-circuit technology (1.2 nm to 2 mm), alternative steps are needed. Thermal
oxidation is an extension of natural oxide growth at an elevated temperature (800 to 1200–C). The temperature
is usually a compromise — it must be high enough to grow the oxide in a reasonable time period and as low
as possible to minimize crystal damage and the unwanted diffusion of dopants already in the wafer.
Oxidation Process
The two most common oxidizing environments are dry and wet. As the name implies, dry oxides are grown in
dry O2 gas following the reaction:
Si þ O2 ! SiO2
ð2:1Þ
Wet oxides were originally grown by bubbling dry oxygen gas through water at 95–C. Most ‘‘wet’’ oxides today
are produced by the pyrogenic reaction of H2 and O2 gas to form steam and are called steam oxidations.
In either case, the reaction is essentially the same at the wafer:
Si þ H2O ! SiO2 þ 2H2
ð2:2Þ
The oxidation process can be modeled as shown in Figure 2.1. The position X0 represents the Si/SiO2 interface,
which is a moving boundary. The volume density of oxidizing species in the bulk gas, NG, is depleted at the
oxide surface, NS, due to an amount, N0, being incorporated in the oxide layer. The oxidizing species then
diffuses across the growing oxide layer, where it reacts with silicon at the moving interface to form SiO2.
FG represents the ﬂux of oxidant transported by diffusion from the bulk gas to the oxide surface. The oxidizing
species that enters the SiO2 diffuses across the growing SiO2 layer with a ﬂux, Fox. A reaction takes place at the
Si/SiO2 interface, consuming some or all of the oxidizing species, as represented by the ﬂux, FI.
In a steady state, these three ﬂux terms are equal and can be used to solve for the concentrations NI and N0
in terms of the reaction rate and diffusion coefﬁcient of the oxidizing species. This in turn speciﬁes the ﬂux
terms, which can be used in the solution of the differential equation:

for the oxide growth, x. In this equation, Nox is the number of oxidant molecules per unit volume of oxide. An
excellent derivation of the growth equation is given in Jaeger (1988, 2002). The result can be represented by

where xox is the oxide thickness, B is the parabolic rate constant, B/A is the linear rate constant, t is the
oxidation time, and t is the initial oxide thickness.
Referring to Equation (2.4), we see there are two regimes of oxide growth. For thin oxides or short time
periods such as the initial phase of the oxidation process, the equation reduces to
xox ¼ B

ð2:5Þ
and growth is a linear function of time, limited by the surface reaction at the Si/SiO2 interface. For thicker
oxides and longer time periods, the reaction is limited by the diffusion of the oxidizing species across the
growing oxide layer. The limiting form of Equation (2.4) is

Oxidation Rate Dependencies
Typical oxidation curves showing oxide thickness as a function of time, with temperature as a parameter for
wet and dry oxidation of ,100. silicon, are shown in Figure 2.2. This type of curve is qualitatively similar for
all oxidations. The oxidation rates are highly temperature dependent, as both the linear- and parabolic-rate
constants show an Arrhenius relationship with temperature. The linear rate is dominated by the temperature
dependence of the interfacial growth reaction and the parabolic rate is dominated by the temperature
dependence of the diffusion coefﬁcient of the oxidizing species in SiO2.

Semiconductor Manufacturing

Wet oxides grow faster than dry oxides. Both the linear- and parabolic-rate constants are proportional to the
equilibrium concentration of the oxidant in the oxide. The solubility of H2O in SiO2 is greater than that of O2.
Hence, the oxidation rate is enhanced for wet oxides.
Dry oxides with chlorine addition grow at a faster rate than pure dry oxides because the chlorine species and
oxygen react to form water vapor as a by-product (Plummer et al., 2000).
The oxidation rate depends on substrate orientation (Jaeger, 1988, 2002). The rate is related to the surface
atom density of the substrate — the higher the density, the faster the oxidation process. The oxidation rate
also depends on pressure. The linear and parabolic rates are dependent on the equilibrium concentration of
the oxidizing species in the SiO2, which is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the oxidant in the
ambient.
Oxide growth rate shows a doping dependence for heavily doped substrates ( .1020 cm–3). Boron increases
the parabolic-rate constant and phosphorus enhances the linear-rate constant (Wolf and Tauber, 1986).
Oxide Characteristics
Dry oxides grow more slowly than wet oxides, resulting in higher density, higher breakdown ﬁeld strengths,
and more controlled growth, thus making them ideal for metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) gate dielectrics.
Wet oxidation is used for forming thick oxides for ﬁeld isolation and for masking implants and diffusions.
The slight degradation in oxide density is more than compensated for by the thickness in these applications.
,100. substrates have fewer dangling bonds at the surface, which results in lower ﬁxed oxide charge and
interface traps and therefore higher quality MOS devices.
Conventional dopants (B, P, As, and Sb) diffuse slowly in both wet and dry oxides and hence these oxides
provide a good barrier for masking diffusions in integrated circuit fabrication.
High-pressure steam oxidations provide a means of growing relatively thick oxides in a reasonable time and
at low temperatures, avoiding dopant diffusion. Conversely, low-pressure oxidations show promise for
forming controlled, ultra-thin gate growth for ULSI technologies.
Chlorine added to gate oxides (Sze, 1988) has been shown to reduce mobile ions, reduce oxide defects,
increase breakdown voltage, reduce ﬁxed oxide charge and interface traps, reduce oxygen-induced stacking
faults, and increase the lifetime of substrate minority carriers. Chlorine is introduced into dry oxidations, in
less than 5% concentrations, as anhydrous HCl gas or by either trichloroethylene (TCE) or trichloroethane
(TCA).
Dopant Segregation and Redistribution
Since silicon is consumed during oxidation, the dopant in the substrate will be redistributed due to segregation
(Wolf and Tauber, 1986). The boundary condition across the Si/SiO2 interface is that the chemical potential of
the dopant is the same on both sides. This results in the deﬁnition of a segregation coefﬁcient, m, as the ratio
of the equilibrium concentration of dopant in Si to the equilibrium concentration of dopant in SiO2.
Depending on the value of m (whether less than or greater than 1) and the diffusion properties of the dopant
in SiO2, various redistributions are possible. For example, m < 0.3 for boron. It is a slow diffuser in SiO2, so it
tends to deplete from the Si surface and accumulate in the oxide at the Si/SiO2 interface. Phosphorus, however,
has m < 10. It is also a slow diffuser in SiO2 and tends to pile up in the Si at the Si/SiO2 interface. Antimony
and arsenic behave similarly to phosphorus.
Oxidation Technology
Thermal oxidation of silicon is achieved by placing wafers in a quartz furnace tube. The tube is surrounded by
a three-zone resistance heater and has provisions for the controlled ﬂow of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, and
the oxidant. The wafer zone has a ﬂat temperature proﬁle to within a fraction of a degree and can handle up to
50 parallel stacked wafers. The horizontal furnace was the mainstay of the semiconductor industry for decades;
however, vertical furnaces are commonly used for processing wafers with diameters of 150 mm or larger.
Modern furnaces are computer-controlled and programmable. Wafers are usually loaded in an inert
environment, ramped to the correct temperature, and switched to the oxidant for a programmed time. When
2-4
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

oxidation is complete, the gas is switched back to the inert gas and the temperature is ramped down to the
unload temperature. All these complications in the process are to minimize thermal stress damage to the
wafers; the procedures can vary considerably.
Oxidation has been, and is certain to remain, an integral part of silicon processing technology. However, as
device dimensions shrink, process requirements shift to a need for lower temperatures to control unwanted
impurity diffusion. A noted example is the move to low-temperature, low-pressure oxidations for thin-gate
oxides. These are typically effected by oxygen dilution in a 10%:90% O2:N2 environment at a temperature of
< 800–C. Another technology shift brought on by the shrinking technology is the use of oxynitride gate
dielectrics to prevent boron diffusion through thin-gate oxides. The ﬁlms are generally prepared by exposing a
thermally grown SiO2 ﬁlm to an N2O or NO ambient. The resulting oxynitride, SiOxNy, usually varies in
composition throughout the ﬁlm, with nitrogen-rich regions near the Si/dielectric interface and at the top of
the dielectric at the SiO2/ambient interface. The oxynitride interface causes rugged gate dielectrics that are
more resistant to bond breaking during hot carrier stressing, more resistant to boron penetration, and have the
additional advantage of a higher gate dielectric than does SiO2.
Detailed discussions of the equipment and procedures can be found in Plummer et al. (2000); Campbell
(2001); Jaeger (2002).
Diffusion
Diffusion is the traditional way dopants were introduced into silicon wafers to create junctions and control
the resistivity of layers. Ion implantation has now superseded diffusion for this purpose. However, the
principles and concepts of diffusion theory remain important, since they describe the movement and
transport of dopants and impurities during the high-temperature processing steps of integrated circuit
manufacture.
Diffusion Mechanism
Consider a silicon wafer with a high concentration of surface impurity. At any temperature, there are a certain
number of vacancies in the Si lattice. If the wafer is subjected to an elevated temperature, the number of
vacancies in the silicon will increase and the impurity will enter the wafer, moving from the high surface
concentration to be redistributed in the bulk. The redistribution mechanism is diffusion. Depending on the
impurity type, it will either be substitutional or interstitial (Ghandhi, 1982).
For substitutional diffusion, the impurity atom substitutes for a silicon atom at a vacancy lattice site and
then moves into the wafer by hopping from lattice site to lattice site via the vacancies. Clearly, the hopping can
be in a random direction; however, since the impurity is present initially in high concentration on the surface
only, there is a net ﬂow of the impurity from the surface into the bulk.
In the case of interstitial diffusion, the impurity diffuses by squeezing between the lattice atoms and taking
residence in the interstitial space between lattice sites. Since this mechanism does not require the presence of a
vacancy, it proceeds much faster than substitutional diffusion. Conventional dopants such as B, P, As, and Sb
primarily diffuse by the substitutional method. This is beneﬁcial because the diffusion process is much slower
and can therefore be controlled more easily in the manufacturing process. In heavily doped regions,
sustitutional impurities diffuse by a variety of mechanisms, which are further inﬂuenced by higher-order
vacancy effects that cause the diffusion coefﬁcient to vary with impurity level. In general, such diffusions
cannot be treated analytically and require numerical solutions of the diffusion equations. Many of the
undesired impurities such as Fe, Cu, and other heavy metals diffuse by the interstitial mechanism. Therefore,
the process is extremely fast; this is beneﬁcial because, at the temperatures used and during the fabrication
processes, the unwanted metals can diffuse completely through the Si wafer. Gettering creates trapping sites on
the back surface of the wafer for these impurities that would otherwise remain in the silicon and cause adverse
device effects.
Simple diffusions, regardless of the diffusion mechanism, can be formalized mathematically in the same way
by introducing a constant diffusion coefﬁcient, D (cm2/sec), that accounts for the diffusion rate. The diffusion
2-5

constants follow an Arrhenius behavior according to the equation:
D ¼ D0 exp  EA
kT


ð2:7Þ
where D0 is the prefactor, EA is the activation energy, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. Conventional silicon dopants (substitutional diffusers) have diffusion coefﬁcients on the order of
10–14 to 10–12 cm2/sec at 1100–C, whereas heavy metal interstitial diffusers (Fe, Au, and Cu) have diffusion
coefﬁcients of 10–6 to 10–5 cm2/sec at this temperature.
The diffusion process can be described using Fick’s laws. Fick’s ﬁrst law states that the ﬂux of impurity, F,
crossing any plane is related to the impurity distribution, N(x,t) per cm3, by
F ¼ D qN
qx
ð2:8Þ
in the one-dimensional case. Fick’s second law states that the time rate of change of the particle density is in
turn related to the divergence of the particle ﬂux:

in the case of a constant diffusion coefﬁcient, as is often assumed. This partial differential equation can be
solved by the separation of variables or by Laplace transform techniques for speciﬁed boundary conditions.
For a constant source diffusion, the impurity concentration at the surface of the wafer is held constant
throughout the diffusion process. The solution of Equation (2.10) under these boundary conditions, assuming
a semi-inﬁnite wafer, results in a complementary error function diffusion proﬁle:

Here, N0 is the impurity concentration at the surface of the wafer, x is the distance into the wafer, and t is the

constant surface concentration. The total number of impurity atoms/cm2 in the wafer is the dose, Q, and it
continually increases with time:

In this case, as time progresses, the impurity penetrates more deeply into the wafer, and the surface
concentration falls so as to maintain a constant dose in the wafer.
Practical Diffusions
Most real diffusions follow a two-step procedure, where the dopant is applied to the wafer with a short,
constant-source diffusion, then driven in with a limited source diffusion. The reason for this is that in trying to
control the dose, a constant-source diffusion must be performed at the solid solubility limit of the impurity in
the Si, which is of the order of 1020 for most dopants. If only a constant-source diffusion were done, this would
result in only very high surface concentrations. Therefore, to achieve lower concentrations, a short constant-
source diffusion is done ﬁrst, achieving a controlled dose of impurities in a near-surface layer. This diffusion is
known as the predeposition, or predep, step. The source is then removed and the dose is diffused into the
wafer, simulating a limited-source diffusion in the subsequent drive-in step. In modern IC processing, the
predep step has been replaced by ion implantation, providing more accurate control of the placement and
dose of impurities in the wafer.
If the Dt product for the drive-in step is much greater than the Dt product for the predep step, the resulting
proﬁle is very close to Gaussian. In this case the dose can be calculated by Equation (2.12) for the predep time
and diffusion coefﬁcient. In the case of ion implantation, the dose is determined by the implant conditions in
a very thin layer and the resulting drive-in ensures a near Gaussian proﬁle. This dose is then used in the
limited source Equation (2.13) to describe the ﬁnal proﬁle based on the time and diffusion coefﬁcient for the
drive-in. If these (Dt) criteria are not met, an integral solution exists for the evaluation of the resulting
proﬁles (Ghandhi, 1968).
Further Proﬁle Considerations
A wafer typically goes through many temperature cycles during fabrication, potentially altering the impurity
proﬁle. The effects of many thermal cycles that take place at different times and temperatures are accounted for
by calculating a total Dt product for the diffusion that is equal to the sum of the individual process Dt
products:
ðDtÞtot ¼
X

ð2:14Þ
Here, Di and ti are the diffusion coefﬁcient and time, respectively, that pertain to the ith process step.
Many diffusions are used to form junctions by diffusing an impurity opposite in type to the substrate. At the
metallurgical junction, xj, the impurity diffusion proﬁle, has the same concentration as the substrate. For a
junction with a surface concentration N0 and substrate doping NB, the metallurgical junction for a Gaussian

Modern processes use ion implantation as the predep and are required to produce shallow junctions with the
drive-in diffusion. In doing this, it was discovered that impurities diffused considerably more than predicted
by simple diffusion theory using the Dt product calculated for the annealing process. It was found that the ion
implant introduced damage to the silicon lattice (cf. next section), enhancing the diffusion coefﬁcient by a
factor of 5 to 10 times. The effect is transient; the annealing removes the damage and thus the enhancement in

diffusion coefﬁcient. Nevertheless, the effect can signiﬁcantly modify the proﬁle, especially in the tail region,
causing signiﬁcant change in the junction depth. Because of the transient nature of the process, it has become
known as transient enhanced diffusion (TED) (Jaeger, 2002).
So far, we have considered only vertical diffusion. In practical IC fabrication, usually only small regions are
affected by the diffusion, by using an oxide mask and making a cut in it where speciﬁc diffusion is to occur, but
we should also be concerned with lateral diffusion of the dopant so as not to affect adjacent devices. Two-
dimensional numerical solutions exist for solving this problem (Jaeger, 1988); however, a useful rule of thumb
is that the lateral junction is yj ¼ 0:8xj:
Another parameter of interest is the sheet resistance of the diffused layer. This has been numerically
evaluated for various proﬁles and presented as general-purpose graphs known as Irvin’s curves. For a given
proﬁle type, such as n-type Gaussian, Irvin’s curves plot surface dopant concentration vs. the product of sheet
resistance and junction depth, with substrate doping as a parameter. Thus, given a calculated diffusion proﬁle,
one could estimate the sheet resistivity for the diffused layer. Alternatively, given the measured junction depth
and sheet resistance, one could estimate the surface concentration for a given proﬁle and substrate doping.
Most processing books (e.g., Jaeger, 1988) contain Irvin’s curves.
Ion Implantation
Diffusion places severe limits on device design, such as hard-to-control, low-dose diffusions, no tailored
proﬁles, and appreciable lateral diffusion at mask edges. Ion implantation overcomes all these drawbacks and is
an alternative approach to diffusion used in virtually all production-doping applications today. Although
many different elements can be implanted, IC manufacture is primarily interested in the conventional silicon
shallow dopants: B, P, As, and Sb.
Ion Implant Technology
A schematic drawing of an ion implanter is shown in Figure 2.3. The ion source operates at relatively high
voltage ( < 20 to 25 kV) and for conventional dopants is usually a gaseous type that extracts the ions from a
plasma. The ions are mass-separated with a 90– analyzer magnet that directs the selected species through a
resolving aperture focused and accelerated to the desired implant energy. At the other end of the implanter is
the target chamber, where the wafer is placed in the beam path. The beam line following the ﬁnal accelerator
and the target chamber is held at or near ground potential for safety reasons. After the ﬁnal acceleration, the
beam is bent slightly off-axis to trap neutrals and is scanned asynchronously over the wafer in the X and Y

directions to maintain dose uniformity. This is often accompanied by rotation and sometimes also by
translation of the target wafer.
The implant parameters of interest are the ion species, implant energy, and dose. The ion species can consist
of singly ionized elements, doubly ionized elements, or ionized molecules. The molecular species can form
shallow junctions with light ions, such as B, using BFþ

where I is the beam current in amperes, A is the wafer area in cm2, tI is the implant time in sec, and n is the

Ion Implant Proﬁles
Ions impinge on the surface of the wafer at a certain energy and give up that energy in a series of electronic and
nuclear interactions with the target atoms before coming to rest. As a result, the ions do not travel in a straight
line but follow a zigzag path resulting in a statistical distribution of ﬁnal placement. To ﬁrst order, the ion
distribution can be described with a Gaussian distribution:

Rp is the projected range, which is the average depth of an implanted ion. The peak concentration, Np, occurs
at Rp and the ions are distributed about the peak with a standard deviation DRp known as the straggle. Curves
for projected range and straggle, taken from Lindhard–Scharff–Schiott (LSS) theory (Gibbons et al., 1975), are
shown in Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5, respectively, for the conventional dopants.

which can be related to the implant conditions by Equation
(2.18). Implant doses can range from 1010 to 1018 per cm2 and
can be controlled within a few percentage points.
The mathematical representation of the implant proﬁle just
presented pertains to an amorphous substrate. Silicon wafers
are crystalline and therefore present the opportunity for the
ions to travel much deeper into the substrate by a process
known as channeling. The regular arrangement of atoms in the
crystalline lattice leaves large amounts of open space that appear as channels in the bulk when viewed from the
major orientation directions, i.e., ,110., ,100., and ,111.. Practical implants are usually done through a
thin oxide, with the wafers tilted off-normal by a small angle (typically 7–) and rotated by 30– to make the
surface atoms appear more randomly oriented. Implants with these conditions agree well with the projected
range curves of Figure 2.4, indicating that the wafers do appear amorphous.
Actual implant proﬁles deviate from the simple Gaussian proﬁles described in the previous paragraphs.
Light ions tend to backscatter from target atoms and ﬁll in the distribution on the surface side of the peak.
Heavy atoms tend to forward-scatter from the target atoms and ﬁll in the proﬁle on the substrate side of the
peak. This behavior has been modeled with distributions such as the Pearson Type-IV distribution (Jaeger,
1988). However, for implant energies below 200 keV and ﬁrst-order calculations, the Gaussian model will
more than sufﬁce.
Masking and Junction Formation
It is usually desirable to implant species only in selected areas of the wafer to alter or create device properties.
Hence, the implant must be masked. This is done by putting a thick layer of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or
photoresist on the wafer and patterning and opening the layer where the implant is desired. To prevent
signiﬁcant alteration of the substrate doping in the mask regions. the implant concentration at the Si/mask
interface, X0, must be less than 1/10 of the substrate doping, NB. Under these conditions, Equation (2.19) can
be solved for the required mask thickness as
X0 ¼ Rp þ DRp

This implies that the range and straggle are known for the mask material being used. These are available in the
literature (Gibbons et al., 1975) but can also be reasonably approximated by making the calculations for Si.
SiO2 is assumed to have the same stopping power as Si and thus would have the same mask thickness. Silicon
nitride has more stopping power than SiO2 and therefore requires only 85% of calculated mask thickness,
whereas photoresist is less effective for stopping the ions and requires 1.8 times the equivalent Si thickness.
Analogous to the mask calculations is junction formation. Here, the metallurgical junction, xj, occurs when
the opposite-type implanted dopant proﬁle is equal to the substrate doping, NB. Solving Equation (2.19) for
these conditions gives the junction depth, XJ, as

Lattice Damage and Annealing
During ion implantation, the impinging atoms can displace Si atoms in the lattice, causing damage to the
crystal. For high implant doses, the damage can be severe enough to make the implanted region amorphous.
Typically, light ions, or light doses of heavy ions, will cause primary crystalline defects (interstitials and
vacancies), whereas medium-to-heavy doses of heavy ions will cause amorphous layers. Implant damage can
be removed by annealing the wafers in an inert gas at 800 to 1000–C for approximately 30 min. Annealing
cycles at high temperatures can cause appreciable diffusion, a consideration especially in the newer
technologies where shallow junctions are required. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) can be successfully applied
to prevent undesirable diffusion in these cases (Campbell, 2001). Annealing cycles of from 950 to 1050–C,
ranging from a few minutes down to only a few seconds, have been used to keep the Dt product manageable in
modern proceses.
Deposition
During IC fabrication, thin ﬁlms of dielectrics (SiO2, Si3N4, etc.), polysilicon, and metal conductors are
deposited on the wafer surface to form devices and circuits. The techniques used to form these thin ﬁlms are
physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and epitaxy, a special case of CVD.
Physical Vapor Deposition
Vacuum evaporation and sputtering are the two methods of physical vapor deposition used in fabricating
integrated circuits. Both processes are carried out in a vacuum to prevent substrate contamination and to
provide a reasonable mean free path for the deposited material. In the early days of integrated circuits,
aluminum was used exclusively for IC metallization and evaporation was used for its deposition. As IC
technology matured, the need for metal alloys, alternative metals, and various insulating thin ﬁlms stimulated
the development and acceptance of sputter deposition as the PVD method of choice.
When the temperature is raised high enough to melt a solid, some atoms have enough internal energy to
break the surface and escape into the surrounding atmosphere. These evaporated atoms strike the wafer and
condense into a thin ﬁlm. Typical ﬁlm thicknesses used in the IC industry are in the few thousand angstroms
to the 1 mm range. Heat is provided by resistance heating, electron beam heating, or rf inductive heating.
Discussions of these techniques and their historical signiﬁcance can be found in most processing books
(e.g., Sze, 1983; Wolf and Tauber, 1986; Jaeger, 2002). The most commonly used system employs a focused
electron beam scanned over a crucible of metal, as illustrated in Figure 2.6(a). Contamination levels can be
quite low because only electrons come into contact with the melted metal. A high-intensity, electron beam,
typically 15 keV, bent through a 270– angle to shield the wafers from ﬁlament contamination, provides the
heating for evaporation of the metal. The wafers are mounted above the source on a planetary substrate holder
that rotates around the source during the deposition to ensure uniform step coverage. For the planetary
substrate holder, shown schematically in Figure 2.6(b), the growth rate is independent of substrate position.
The relatively large size of the crucible provides an ample supply of deposition source material. The deposition
rate is controlled by changing the current and energy of the electron beam. Dual beams with dual targets can
be used to co-evaporate composite ﬁlms. Device degradation due to x-ray radiation, generated by the electron-
beam system, is of great concern in MOS processing. Because of this, sputtering has replaced e-beam
evaporation in many process lines.
Sputtering is achieved by bombarding a target surface with energetic ions that dislodge target atoms from
the surface by direct momentum transfer. Under the proper conditions, the sputtered atoms are transported to
the wafer surface, where they deposit to form a thin ﬁlm. Sputter deposition takes place in a chamber that is
evacuated and then backﬁlled with an inert gas at roughly 10 mtorr pressure. A glow discharge within the gas
between two electrodes, one of which is the target, creates a plasma that provides the source of ions for the
sputter process. Metals can be sputtered in a simple, dc parallel plate reactor with the most negative electrode
being the target and the most positive electrode (usually ground) being the substrate holder. If the dc voltage is
replaced by an rf voltage, insulators as well as conductors can be sputter-deposited. Magnetron systems
2-11
Semiconductor Manufacturing

incorporate a magnetic ﬁeld that enhances the efﬁciency of the discharge by trapping secondary electrons in
the plasma and lowers substrate heating by reducing the energy of electrons reaching the wafer. Circular
magnetrons (S-guns) virtually eliminate substrate heating by electron bombardment due to a ring-shaped
cathode/anode combination, where the substrate is a non-participating system electrode (Sze, 1983). Besides
insulators and conductors, sputtering can be used to deposit alloy ﬁlms with the same composition as an
alloy target.
Chemical Vapor Deposition
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method of forming thin ﬁlms on a substrate in which energy is supplied
for a gas-phase reaction. The energy can be supplied by heat, plasma excitation, or optical excitation. Since the
reaction can take place close to the substrate, CVD can be performed at atmospheric pressure (i.e., low mean
free path) or at low pressure. Relatively high
temperatures can be used, resulting in excellent
conformal step coverage; or relatively low tempera-
tures can be used to passivate a low melting
temperature ﬁlm such as aluminum. Substrates can
be amorphous or single crystalline. The epitaxial
growth of Si is simply CVD on a single crystalline
substrate, resulting in a single crystal layer. Generally,
unless the qualifying adjective, epitaxial, is used, the
depositions are assumed to result in amorphous or
polycrystalline ﬁlms. Typically all CVD depositions
show a growth rate versus temperature dependence as
illustrated in Figure 2.7. At low temperatures, the
deposition is limited by surface reaction rates and
shows an Arrhenius-type behavior. At high tempera-
tures the rate is dominated by mass transfer of the

reactant and the growth rate is essentially temperature independent. The transition temperature, where
the reaction switches from reaction rate to mass-ﬂow dominated, is dependent on other factors such as
pressure, reactant species, and energy source.
Several types of ﬁlms can be deposited by CVD. Insulators and dielectrics (such as SiO2 and Si3N4), doped
glasses (PSG, BPSG), and nonstoichiometric dielectrics as well as semiconductors (such as Si, Ge, GaAs, and
GaP) can be deposited. Conductors of pure metals, such as Al, Ni, Au, Pt, Ti, etc., as well as silicides such as
WSi2 and MoSi2 can also be deposited.
CVD systems come in a multitude of designs and conﬁgurations and are selected for their compatibility
with the method, energy source, and temperature range being used. Reaction chambers can be quartz, similar
to diffusion or oxidation furnaces, or stainless steel. Wafer holders also depend on the type of reaction and can
be graphite, quartz, or stainless steel. Cold-wall systems employ direct heating of the substrate or wafer holder
by induction or radiation. As such, the reaction takes place right at the wafer surface and is usually cleaner
because the ﬁlm does not build up on the chamber walls. In a hot-wall deposition system, the reaction takes
place in the gas stream and the reaction product is deposited on every surface in the system, including the
walls. Such unwanted depositions build up and ﬂake off these surfaces in time. Without proper cleaning and
maintenance procedures, they become a source of contamination.
Atmospheric-pressure deposition systems were ﬁrst used in the deposition of epitaxial Si in bipolar
processes (such as buried layer formation). Early systems were horizontal, rf induction-heated systems using
graphite substrate holders. Atmospheric pressure systems rely on ﬂow dynamics in the chamber to produce
uniform ﬁlms. Since the reactant species is being depleted from the gas stream, it is imperative that the system
design (ﬂow pattern and rate) ensures that all wafers receive the same amount of deposit. Because of this, most
atmospheric depositions are carried out using a horizontal or near-horizontal wafer holder.
Low-pressure CVD depositions are performed at pressures in the 0.5 to 1 torr range and most often in a
horizontal hot-wall reactor. Wafers are held vertically and the system is operated in the reaction rate limited
regime. A multi-zone furnace (typically three) is used to allow the temperature to be increased along the wafer
holder to compensate for gas depletion by deposition along the ﬂow path. LPCVD is typically used to deposit
SiO2 (< 925–C), Si3N4 (< 850–C), and polycrystalline Si (< 630–C). Because of the higher temperatures,
excellent conformal step coverage can be obtained.
Plasma-enhanced CVD uses a plasma to supply the required reaction energy. Typically, rf energy is used to
produce a glow discharge so that the gas constituents are in a highly reactive state. Because of the ability of the
plasma to impart high energy to the reaction at low temperatures, these depositions maintain many of the
excellent features of LPCVD, such as step coverage. They have low-temperature attributes, such as reduced
wafer warpage, less impurity diffusion, and less ﬁlm stress. Plasma-enhanced deposition results in
nonstoichiometric, highly hydrogenated ﬁlms such as SiO–H, SiN–H, and amorphous Si–H.
Lithography and Pattern Transfer
In the production of integrated circuits, thin ﬁlms are fabricated in the Si wafer and either grown or deposited
on the surface. Each of these layers has a functionality as either an active part of a device, a barrier or mask, or
an inter- or intra-layer isolation. To perform its intended function, each of these layers must be located in
speciﬁc regions on the wafer surface. This is accomplished either by patterning and etching a thin ﬁlm to serve
as a mask to form the desired function by a blanket process or by forming the desired layer and then
patterning and etching it to provide the device function in local areas.
Wafer Patterning
Lithography is a transfer process where the pattern on a mask is replicated in a radiation-sensitive layer on the
wafer surface. Typically, this has been accomplished with UV light as the radiation source and photoresist, or
resist in conventional terminology, which is a UV-sensitive polymer as the mask layer. The wafers, along with
the layer to be patterned, are cleaned and prebaked (400 to 800–C for 20 to 30 min) to drive off moisture and
promote resist adhesion. Many processes also add an adhesion promoter such as hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) at this point, which removes unwanted surface radicals that prevent adhesion. Then, a few drops of
2-13
Semiconductor Manufacturing

resist are deposited on a wafer that is spinning at a slow rate to produce a uniform coating. The spin speed is
increased to enhance drying. The wafer with resist is softbaked at 80 to 90–C for 10 to 30 min to drive off the
remaining solvents. The wafers are then put in an exposure system, and the mask pattern to be transferred is
aligned to any existing wafer patterns. Present-day exposure systems are step and repeat cameras, where the
mask is a 5 · enlargement of a single chip pattern. Earlier systems used a 1 · mask for the whole wafer and
were of the contact, proximity or 1 · projection variety (Anner, 1990). The resist is exposed through the mask
to UV radiation that changes its structure, depending on whether the resist type is positive or negative.
Negative resist becomes polymerized (or cross-linked) in areas exposed to radiation, whereas in a positive
resist the polymer bonds are scissioned upon exposure. The resist is not affected in regions where the mask is
opaque. After full wafer exposure, the resist is developed such that the unpolymerized regions are selectively
dissolved in an appropriate solvent. The polymerized portion of the resist remains intact on the wafer surface,
replicating the mask’s opaque features in a positive resist, and the opposite for a negative resist.
As the minimum feature size approaches the wavelength of light used in optical exposure systems,
resolution is lost due to diffraction limitations. Development alternatives are continually being developed to
overcome these limitations and extend the life of optical lithography. The simplest method is to use a
shorter wavelength. Initially, IC lithography was done with a Hg-rare gas discharge lamp as the source using
the UV g-line (l ¼ 436 nm) emission. In submicron technology, the i-line (l ¼ 365 nm) was brought into
use. At the deep submicron node, 0.25 mm, the krypton ﬂuoride (KrF) excimer laser deep UV (DUV)
source (l ¼ 248 nm) was introduced. The argon ﬂuoride (ArF) source (l ¼ 193 nm) was introduced into
mainstream processing around the 100 nm technology node and the F2 excimer laser (l ¼ 157 nm) is
projected for the 70 nm tecnology node (Braun, 2003). With the shift to DUV sources, the resist also had to
change as the conventional Novolac resin, DNQ, resists are opaque at these wavelengths. DUV resists are
based on the chemically ampliﬁed resists that provide further contrast and resolution enhancements to the
technology (Plummer et al., 2002). Further extensions of this technique introduce optical proximity
correction and optical phase shifting in the photomask itself, extending the diffraction limit even further
(Campbell, 2001; Plummer et al., 2002; Mauer, 2003). These techniques are eventually limited, somewhere
in the range of the 50 nm technology node (Braun, 2003), and new-generation lithography (NGL)
techniques, such as electron beam projection lithography (EPL), or x-ray systems will have to replace the
optical systems for the ﬁnest dimension patterning. These techniques are capable of wavelengths much
shorter than conventional deep UV or extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) and thus have much higher
resolution capabilities. They are analogous in operation to optical systems but use resists speciﬁcally tailored
for sensitivity in their appropriate wavelength range. Mix-and-match lithography for different feature sizes
is currently used by some companies and is expected to become more prevalent in the future, to keep
thoughput up and equipment costs down as device dimensions continue to scale (Hand, 2003).
Pattern Transfer
After the resist pattern is formed, it is transferred to the surface layer of the wafer. Sometimes, this is an
invisible transfer, such as for ion implantation, but more often it involves a physical transfer of the pattern by
etching the surface layer, using the resist as a mask. This results in the desired structure or produces a more
etch-resistant mask for further pattern transfer operations.
Historically, the most common etch processes used wet chemicals. During wet etching, wafers with resist (or
a resist transferred mask) are immersed in a temperature-controlled etchant for a ﬁxed time period. The etch
rate is dependent on the strength of the etchant, temperature, and material being etched. Such chemical etches
are isotopic, which means the vertical and lateral etch rates are the same. Thus, the thicker the layer being
etched, the greater the undercutting of the mask pattern. Most wet etches are stopped by an underlying etch-
stop layer that is impervious to the etchant used to remove the top layer. To ensure that the layer is totally
removed, an over-etch is allowed, exacerbating the undercutting.
Modern high-density, small-feature processes require anisotropic etch processes; this requirement has
driven the development of dry etching techniques. Plasma etching is a dry-etch technique that uses an rf
plasma to generate chemically active etchants that form volatile etch species with the substrate. Typically,
chlorine or ﬂuorine compounds, most notably CCl4 and CF4, have been tailored for etching polysilicon, SiO2,
2-14
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Si3N4, and metals. The etch rate can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by adding 5 to 10% O2 to the etch gas. However,
this increases erosion of resist masks.
Early plasma etch systems were barrel reactors that used a perforated metal cylinder to conﬁne the plasma in
a region outside the wafers. In such reactors, the etch species are electrically neutral, so the reaction is entirely
chemical and just as isotropic as wet chemical etch. A similar result occurs for a planar parallel plate rf reactor
where the wafer is placed on the grounded electrode. However, some anisotropic etching is achieved in this
conﬁguration because ions can reach the wafer. This is further enhanced in reactive ion etching (RIE) where
the wafer is placed on the rf electrode in a planar parallel plate reactor. Here, the ions experience a considerable
acceleration to the wafer by the dc potential developed between plasma and cathode, resulting in anisotropic
etching. The etch processes require signiﬁcant characterization and development through optimization of
pressure, gas ﬂow rate, gas mixture, and power to produce the desired etch rate, anisotropy, selectivity,
uniformity, and resist erosion. Nevertheless, RIE has been the workhorse of etch processes in modern ULSI
processes. A less-popular version uses a beam of reactive species for the etch process and is called reactive ion
beam etching (RIBE). A new type of plasma etch system that is becoming more popular is the high density
plasma (HDP) etch system (Plummer et al., 2002). These systems produce a plasma density much higher than
standard RIE systems (1011 to 1012 ions/cm3), without a large sheath bias by using a non-capacitively coupled
source such as electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources. This allows
lower pressures to be used in the system while still achieving high ion ﬂuxes and etch rates. A lower pressure
means fewer gas-phase collisions in the sheath. Thus, a more-directed etching is provided for more anisotropic
etching, as needed with the small dimensions in modern processes.
Finally, it should be noted that near-total anisotropic dry etching can be achieved with ion etching. This is
done with an inactive species (e.g., Ar ions) either in a beam or with a parallel plate sputtering system with the
wafer on the rf electrode. This results in an etch process that is entirely physical through momentum transfer.
The etch rate is primarily controlled by the sputtering efﬁciency for various materials and thus does not differ
signiﬁcantly from material to material. Hence, such processes suffer from poor selectivity. Resist or mask
erosion is also a problem with these techniques. Because of these limitations, virtually the only application of
pure ion etching in VLSI/ULSI is for sputter-cleaning of wafers before deposition.
New Processes
Rapid thermal processing (RTP) and chemical mechanical processing (CMP) are two new unit-step processes
that have come into existence with the evolution to smaller and smaller dimensions in process technology and
are worthy of note here.
As devices shrink in lateral dimensions, an attendant shrinkage in vertical dimensions is mandated to
maintain proper device performance. This implies minimization of the diffusion and redistribution of dopants
in thermal processes and thinner ﬁlms (such as gate oxides, nitrides, and silicides). Low-temperature
processing might seem to be a viable approach to solve these problems, as in the case of low-pressure
oxidations. However, some processes, such as implant annealing, are not effective at low temperatures. Some
dopants cannot be fully activated and certain types of implant damage cannot be annealed out unless high
temperatures are used. The only possibility is to use high temperatures for short times. Standard furnace
processing is not suited to short time-processing steps due to wafer warpage, which results from temperature
gradients because the wafers are heated from the edges inward. RTP describes a family of single-wafer hot
processes developed to minimize the thermal budget by reducing the time at a particular temperature in
addition to, or instead of, reducing the temperature.
Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) systems were the ﬁrst of the RTP processes developed to achieve the desired
implant activation and damage annealing. High-intensity lamps are used to rapidly heat the wafer to the
desired annealing temperature (e.g., 950 to 1050–C) in a very short time (minutes down to a few seconds).
Extremely fast temperature ramp-up and ramp-down rates of 50–C/sec or more can be achieved. Using RTA,
the effective Dt product can be kept very small. RTA represents only one form of RTP. Similar systems are used
to grow very thin gate oxides in a process known as rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) and nitride layers by
2-15
Semiconductor Manufacturing

rapid thermal nitridation (RTN). RTP processes can be used for chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) in the
formation of silicides and for epitaxial growth.
CMP was introduced to fabrication processes in the early 1990s to achieve highly planar topologies. This has
allowed optical lithography to go far beyond original expectations through the use of higher numerical
aperture lenses, with their subsequent loss in depth of focus. In a CMP system, the wafer is mounted on a
carrier and is brought into contact with a polishing pad mounted on a rotating platen. A liquid slurry is
continuously dispensed onto the surface of the polishing pad. A combination of the vertical force between the
wafer and the pad along with the chemical action of the slurry, permits a process capable of polishing the
surface of the wafer to a highly planar state.

2.2
Testing1
Wayne Needham
The function of testing a semiconductor device is twofold. First is design debug, to understand the failing
section of the device, identify areas for changes, and verify correct modes of operation. The second major area
is to simply separate good devices from bad devices in a production testing environment. Data collection and
information analysis are equally important in both types of test, but for different reasons. The ﬁrst case is
obvious; debug requires understanding of the part. In the second case, data collected from a test program may
be used for yield enhancement. This is done by ﬁnding marginal areas of the device or in the fabrication
process and then making improvements to raise yields and therefore lower cost.
In this section, we will look at methods of testing that can be used for data collection, analysis, and debug of
a new device. No discussion of testing would be useful if the test strategy is not thought out clearly before
design implementation. Design for test (access for control and observation) is a requirement for successful
debug and testing of any semiconductor device.
The basis for all testing of complex integrated circuits is a comparison of known good patterns to the
response of a device under test (DUT). The simulation of the devices is done with input stimuli, and those
same input stimuli (vectors) are presented on the DUT. Comparisons are made cycle by cycle with an option
to ignore certain pins, times, or patterns. If the device response and the expected response are not in
agreement, the devices are usually considered defective.
This section will cover common techniques for testing. Details of generation of test programs, simulation of
devices, and tester restrictions are not covered here.

Built-In Self-Test
Self-testing (built-in self-test or BIST) is essentially the implementation of logic built into the circuitry to do
testing without the use of the tester for pattern generation and comparison purposes. A tester is still needed
to categorize failures and to separate good from bad units. In this case, the test system supplies clocks to the
device and determines pass/fail from the outputs of the device. The sequential elements are run with a known
data pattern, and a signature is generated. The signature can be a simple go or no-go signal presented on one
pin of the part, or the signal may be a polynomial generated during testing. This polynomial has some
signiﬁcance to actual states of the part. Figure 2.8 shows a typical self-testing technique implemented on a
large block of random logic, inside a device. The number of unique inputs to the logic block should be
limited to 20 bits so the total vectors are less than 1 million. This keeps test time to less than 1 sec in
most cases.
Self-test capability can be implemented on virtually any size block. It is important to understand the
tradeoffs between the extra logic added to implement self-testing and the inherent logic of the block to be
tested. For instance, adding self-testing capability to a RAM requires adding counters and read, write, and
multiplexor circuitry to allow access to the part. The access is needed not only by the self-test circuitry, but by
the circuitry that would normally access the RAM.
When implementing self-testing on blocks such as RAMs and ROMs, it is worthwhile to note the typical
failure mode of semiconductor devices. Single-bit defects can easily be detected using self-testing techniques.
Single-point defects in the manufacturing process can show up as a single transistor failure in a RAM or ROM,
or they may be somewhat more complex. If a single-point defect happens to be in the decoder section or in a
row or column within the RAM, a full section of the device may be nonfunctional.
The problem with this failure mode is that RAMs and ROMs are typically laid out in a square or rectangular
array. They are usually decoded in powers of 2, such as a 32 * 64 or a 256 * 512 array. If the self-testing circuitry
is an 8-bit-wide counter or linear feedback shift register, there may be problems. There are 256 possible
combinations within the states of the counter, and this may be a multiple of the row or columns. Notice that
256 possible rows or multiples of 256 rows in the array and 256 states in the counter make for a potential
error-masking combination. If the right type of failure modes occur and a full row is nonfunctional, it may be
masked. The implementation of the counter or shift register must be done with full-column or row failure
modes in mind, or it can easily mask failures. This masking of the failure gives a false result that the device is
passing the test.

Scan
Scan is a test technique that ties together some or all the latches in the part to form a path through the
part to shift data. Figure 2.9 shows the implementation of a scan latch in a circuit. Note that the latch has
a dual mode of operation. In the normal mode, the latches act like normal ﬂip-ﬂops for data storage. In the
scan mode, the latches act like a shift register connecting one element to another. This is a basic
implementation of a shift register or scan latch in a block of logic. Data can be shifted in via the shift pin
or can be clocked in from the data pin. Clock line is the normal system clock and SCLK is the shift clock
for scan operations.
Data for testing are shifted in on the serial data in pins of the device. Patterns for the exercise of the
combinatorial logic could be generated by truth table or by random generation of patterns. These patterns are
then clocked a single time to store the results of the combinatorial logic. The latches now contain the results of
the combinatorial logic operations. Testing of the logic becomes quite easy, as the sequential depth into the
part is of no signiﬁcance to the designer. Once the patterns are latched, the same serial technique is used to
shift them out for comparison purposes. At the time of outward shift, new patterns are shifted in. Figure 2.10
shows this pattern shift for a circuit using scan. This is the actual implementation of scan in a small group of
logic, including the truth table associated with it and one state of testing.
Direct Access Testing
Direct access is a method whereby one gains access to a device logic block by bringing signals from the block to
the outside world via multiplexors. Data are then forced into the block directly and the outputs are directly
measured. This is one of the simplest methods to check devices for logic functionality. This particular method
would supplement previous testing methods by allowing the user to impose data patterns directly on large
blocks of logic. The same feature holds true for output observation. In the direct access scheme, access of a
test mode would force certain logic blocks via multiplexors to have access to the outside pins of the part.
One could then drive the data patterns to the input pins, compare output pins of the part, and measure the
access, status, and logical functionality of the block directly.
Figure 2.11 shows implementation of direct access test techniques on a block of logic. During normal
operation, the logic block B has inputs driven by the logic block A, and outputs are connected to the logic
block C. In the test mode, the two multiplexors are switched so that the input and output pins of the device
can control and observe the logic block B directly.

Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)
When implemented in a device, Joint Test Action Group (JTAG), or IEEE 1149.1, allows rapid and accurate
measurement of the direct connections from one device to another on a PC board. This speciﬁcation deﬁnes a
Test Access Port (TAP) for internal and external IC testing. Figure 2.12 shows the TAP use in a small device,
thus allowing accurate measurement and detection of solder connections and bridging on a PC board. This
technique allows the shifting of data through the input and output pins of the part to ensure correct
connections on the PC board. The four required pins are shown at the bottom of the drawing, and all the I/O
ports are modiﬁed to include 1149.1 latches. The internal logic of the part does not need to change in order to
implement 1149.1 boundary scan capability.

JTAG test capability, or IEEE P1149.1 standard Test Access Port and boundary scan capability, allows the
designer to implement features that enhance testing. Both PC board test capability and the internal logic
veriﬁcation of the device can be facilitated. For systems where remaining components on the boards are
implemented with the 1149.1 scan approach, adding a TAP to a device is a wise step to take. Scan, BIST, and
direct access can all be controlled by the 1149.1 test access port.
Pattern Generation for Functional Test Using Unit Delay
During simulation of the function portion of the device, patterns are captured and stored for exercise of the
system. Figure 2.13 shows typical patterns for each block and the width of the data for test. The patterns check
the functionality of the logic and ensure that the logic implemented performs the desired function in the
device. The patterns can be generated by several methods if they were not generated by self-test. First is
exercising of the system by use of code such as assemblers, macros, and high-level inputs that ensure the
operation. Usually this is done by comparison of a high-level model to the actual logic. A second method of
pattern generation is random number generation; in this case random numbers of ones and zeros are
impressed on the logic and the results compared to a high-level model. Finally, coding of ones and zeros for
logic checking is an alternative, but this is typically prohibitive in today’s technology where devices may
contain millions of logic gates.
Pattern Generation for Timing
After the functional patterns are complete, speciﬁc tests for timing may be generated. Timing tests are test
procedures to verify the correction operation to the timing speciﬁcation of the device. Typical timing tests
include outputs relative to the clocks, propagation delays, set-up and hold times, access times, minimum and
maximum speed of operation, rise and fall times, and others. These tests are captured in simulation and used
in the test system to verify performance of the device. Table 2.1 shows the relationship between time-based
simulation and cycle-based test ﬁles.

Temperature, Voltage, and Processing Effects
Figure 2.14 shows the impact on speed of process variations, and as a result of voltage or temperature
variations. It is important to simulate with the total variation over the entire process, temperature, and voltage
range to ensure testability. Remember that if the system design of the logic was not done with some

guard-banding, there may be no margin. If the library used for the design did not include some amount
of margin, there may be a need to add guardbanding by optimizing logic for speed or choosing faster
gates. There must be a delta placed between the testing parameters used for initial production testing and
ﬁnal quality assurance (QA) test of the devices. This will ensure that they are electrically stable and
manufacturable.
It is very important to review the critical paths, timing parameters, and the early simulations versus the
timing parameters in the ﬁnal simulation. The effect of parasitic capacitance and resistance will show up now.
This is the time to look back to see whether the performance of the device will meet all the system
speciﬁcations.
If the design meets all the device speciﬁcations and all the system speciﬁcations, now is the time to sign off
and accept this simulation. If the simulations do not match the system requirements, this is the time to ﬁx
them once again.
Fault Grading
Fault grading is a measure of test coverage of a given set of stimuli and response for a given circuit. This
ﬁgure of merit is used to ensure that the device is fully testable and measurable. Once the test patterns are
developed for the device, artiﬁcial faults are put in via simulation to ensure that the part is testable and
observable.
Figure 2.15 shows a single stuck-at-one (S@1) faults injected into logic circuitry with data patterns for
checking the functionality. Notice in the truth table that faults on one gate show up on an output pin of the
part or test observation point. Gaining high fault coverage is a very desirable method for ensuring that the
device will function correctly in the system. Semiconductor failure modes include not only stuck-at-zeros and
-ones but several other types, including delay faults, bridging faults, and leakage faults.
It is also important to mention that although fault grading using single stuck-at-zero and single S@1 faults
covers many aspects of semiconductor failures, it does not cover all of them. For example, bridging faults are
one of the more common types of failures within semiconductor devices; they may be caught with stuck-at-
fault graded patterns if the patterns are done correctly.
Test Program Flow
Data patterns that were generated during simulation are then converted into a functional test program.
Table 2.2 shows a typical test ﬂow used by a semiconductor vendor for exercising the device. It describes the
basic test done, along with the portions of the speciﬁcation of the device tested in each step. The ﬂow is from

loose testing of the device to detailed checking of speciﬁcations; this basic ﬂow is both efﬁcient and helpful in
debugging failures encountered during test. Table 2.3 shows the approximate test time for a 100-pin device as
executed on a veriﬁcation system. Notice that a large number of tests can be done in a very short time. The test
times are approximate and will vary based on the type of system used, by the type of test executed, length of
patterns, and pin count.
The cost of testing is very much related to test time. In production, package handlers, wafer probe
equipment, people, and perhaps a computer network are all needed to run production tests. When comparing
test time on a small system to a large system, total cost must also be compared. In this case, total cost is the
cost of the test equipment along with the needed support equipment. Table 2.4 shows the same test time for
the same device on a large production test system. Again, the test time is approximate and will vary depending
on options, program ﬂow, and test details. The biggest reason for the difference in test time from a veriﬁcation
system to a production system is due to pattern reload time.

Regardless of the techniques that were used for the generation of the data patterns, it will be necessary to
include those patterns into a test program. This is similar to that shown in Table 2.5. This is the same ﬂow with
the addition of information from the net list and vector simulations. Vectors are used for functional tests and
some portions of I/O testing. Net list description and selection of input pads and power connections are used
in the parametric tests. Although the ﬂow may vary from one manufacturer to another, most of them perform
essentially the same kinds of tests.
Even if the device uses special testing techniques such as JTAG, BIST, scan, or direct access, the ﬂow is always
the same. It is basically always done with a setup sequence or a preconditioning of the part, and a formal
measurement of the data on the device under test. The testing may be on a cycle-by-cycle basis or as a pass or
fail conclusion at the end of a long routine. There may be a burst of data to set up the part and a burst of data
to measure it. Finally, information is interpreted by the program to categorize or bin the device as a pass or fail
rating.

Electrical Characterization of Interconnections
S. Rajaram
Semiconductor technology provides electronic system designers with high-speed integrated circuit (IC)
devices that operate at switching speeds approaching 1 nsec and lower. For the past 25 years, the performance
and cost of digital electronic systems have improved continuously because of the technological advances in
manufacturing physically smaller devices. With the reduction in the feature sizes of the gates and cells that
make up these devices, there has also been a tremendous increase in the density of IC integration. These
physically smaller devices with their intrinsic faster switching speeds and lower power per gate have given rise

to the very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology. We therefore have a situation today in which IC
technology includes both high density and high speed. The unprecedented gains in the increasing scales of
integration in IC technology are shown in Figure 2.16.
For leading-edge technology, the maximum number of components (transistors) per chip increases by a
factor of 100 per decade. It is tempting to believe that these increases may be extended indeﬁnitely, leading to
ever smaller devices with increasingly larger electronic functionality. However, the limiting factor for such
spectacular gains in IC technology is the electrical performance capability of its associated interconnections
and packaging (I&P). Thus, interconnections and packaging is the bottleneck to IC performance. The signal
originates from an IC device referred to as the driver and is received by another IC device called the receiver.
The path between the driver and the receiver is the I&P medium. The various elements of I&P are shown in
Figure 2.17.
The elements that make up I&P are the IC package (including its wirebonds inside the package and the leads
or pins external to the package), printed circuit board (PCB) with conductor (copper) traces, electrical PCB
connector, backplane or motherboard, and external cables. The driver and receiver may be on the same PCB or
on different PCBs within the same equipment or in different equipment. I&P should be designed so as to cause
minimal signal degradation from the driver to the receiver. Thus, there are several interfaces within I&P, and
signal degradation occurs at every interface. The elements of I&P between the driver and the receiver resemble

Semiconductor Manufacturing

The key role of I&P is to enable electronic system designers to fully exploit the advancements taking place in
device and manufacturing technologies related to ICs. I&P technology is dictated by three main external
forces. These are silicon IC technology, automated systems for assembly and testing, and the fundamental
architecture of electronic systems (Hoover et al., 1987). We have already seen the 100-fold increase in
component density at the IC level. Most of the electronic functions are built into these dense ICs. However, the
system functionality is contained in several ICs that must ‘‘talk’’ to each other. The medium connecting
various ICs in a system is generically referred to as I&P. Therefore, in order to attain the performance
capability of the IC, it is necessary to have an I&P medium to match its electrical performance. The electrical
parameters of the I&P must be tailored to meet IC performance. This becomes the crux of any high-speed
electronic system design. To optimize IC performance, therefore, it is also necessary to minimize the size of all
interconnections. However, to optimize manufacturing costs, I&P must be large enough to attain reliable and
high-yield assembly operations, test access, repair, and maintenance. Thus, these requirements imply
automated assembly and test equipment for high-quality manufacture of electronic systems with optimal cost.
Finally, I&P is also dictated by system architecture requirements.
Historically, telecommunications systems have had system requirements dictating the high density of
interconnection and input/output (I/O) signals at moderately low speeds and low interconnection density or
low I/O at moderately higher speeds. However, today the trend is toward high I/O and high speed, which
increases the interconnection density on I&P elements. These have caused a fundamental change in the IC
package and manufacturing and assembly technologies associated with electronic systems. Electrical
performance requirements of the I&P have forced the change from dual inline package (DIP) ICs to surface
mount (SM). The SM ICs have much smaller package outlines and leads than the corresponding DIPs. While
the DIPs are soldered into holes drilled through the PCB, SM components are soldered onto pads on the
surface of the PCB. While the pitch on the leads of a DIP is 100 mil (0.100 in.), the pitch on SM IC package
leads is typically 25 to 50 mil. I&P technology has therefore evolved rapidly as the driving forces behind it have
advanced at a rapid pace. It is fairly accurate to state that the ultimate quality and reliability of many complex
electronic systems are determined primarily by the reliability of the I&P of the system. The stringent electrical
and density requirements impose severe constraints and challenges on mechanical design and manufacturing
capability. Most failure mechanisms today are related to interconnections in the system.
Interconnection Metrics
In Figure 2.16, we observed the tremendous increase in the IC scale of integration. We have also made the
statement that the increased IC component density has led to increased interconnection density. It is
important to understand the relationship between the scale of component integration inside the IC package
and the interconnection density requirements outside the IC package. Figure 2.16 also shows the evolution of
the number of pins interconnected (assembly points) on a PCB within an area of 100 in.2, and the trend
is obvious. This data is derived from CAD packages used within Bell Labs for PCB layout. IC circuits are
usually described in terms of number of gates (1 gate < 4 transistors). The relationship between the number of
gates of an IC (G) to the number of signal I/O pins in the package (P) is given empirically by Rent’s rule
(Hoover et al., 1987). For random logic, Rent’s rule states that P ¼ KGa. The value of K ranges from 3 to 6 and
a typically ranges from 0.4 to 0.55. For a functionally complete chip, K < 7 and a < 0.2 (Moresco, 1990). The
empirical Rent’s rule has been found to apply remarkably well over a large range of circuit sizes, as shown in
Figure 2.18.
This simple empirical relationship is important in understanding the fundamental trade-offs between
interconnection costs, reliability, and increased scales of integration. Let us assume that a certain electrical
function requires the use of 100,000 gates. Let us partition the circuitry into ICs with 100, 1000, and 10,000
gates per chip (device). Let us apply Rent’s rule by taking K ¼ 4 and a ¼ 0.5, and examine the I/O pins, and
therefore the interconnection requirements for the three circuit partition choices, as shown in Table 2.6
(Hoover et al., 1987).
The most important observation to be made from Table 2.6 is that increasing the IC scale of integration by a
factor of 100 moves 90% of the external interconnections into silicon. The density of the interconnection at
2-28
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

the silicon increases, but the overall cost of interconnec-
tions for the system decreases since the relative costs per
interconnection in silicon are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
cheaper than those on PCBs and hybrid integrated
circuits (HICs). This is clearly shown in Figure 2.19.
This is the driving force for integrating as much
functionality in silicon, with reduced external intercon-
nections. However, the problem is compounded by the
fact that many such dense ICs are now placed on a board, and these have to be interconnected on a dense
multilayer board. This has led to the requirement for ﬁne-line PCB technology with increasing numbers of
layers. The dense traces on the board lead to high I/O (pin count) connectors requiring as many as 400 I/Os on
an 8-in. board edge. Thus, there is an increasing density of interconnection at every level, both internal and
external to silicon, as shown in Table 2.7.

Another important aspect of increasing the scale of integration at the IC level is the improved overall
reliability of the system. Practical experience indicates that the Failure unIT (FIT) count of an IC is
approximately constant for a given IC technology and manufacturer and is almost independent of the number
of gates per chip. A FIT is deﬁned as one failure in 109 h. Therefore, system FIT count due to devices should
decrease inversely in proportion to scale of integration. Once again, let us consider the example of partitioning
100,000 gates into devices with 100, 1000, and 10,000 gates per IC. Thus, from 100 gates per IC, we have
increased the scale of integration by a factor of 10 and 100 as we go to 1000 and 10,000 gates per chip,
respectively. The FIT count for an IC is taken as 50. The total system FIT count is the sum total of the IC and
interconnections FIT count. These are shown in Table 2.8, where the FIT counts for interconnections are those
appropriate for the PCB types for the levels of integration based on experience at AT&T (Hoover et al., 1987).
The important message is that there is a tremendous improvement in system reliability (FIT count) with
increasing scales of integration in silicon. It is important to remember that the example shown in Table 2.8 is
an ideal situation. In any practical situation, the circuit is partitioned into many devices with different levels of
integration, with a few VLSI, but 50 or more small scale integration devices. Typically, the total system FIT
count, including devices and interconnections, may be in the range of 3000 to 5000. The remarkable attribute
of IC technology is that as the scale of integration increases, the total system cost decreases, while the overall
system reliability improves considerably. It is this remarkable attribute that has led to a continuous decrease in
the cost of electronics products with increased functionality with time. However, the miniaturization and the
consequent increased scales of integration and interconnections density at the packaging level together with
increasing switching speeds have resulted in a whole range of interesting electrical problems. Although these
problems appear to be new, solutions to many of them are available from extensive work that has been well
documented in the microwave area. In the sections that follow we will discuss the signiﬁcance of the important
electrical parameters and techniques to evaluate them.
Interconnection Electrical Parameters
The interconnection medium is the basic path for transmitting the pulse from the driver to the receiver. As the
speed of the circuits goes beyond 10 MHz, it is necessary to use high-frequency techniques developed by RF
engineers. The fundamental electrical parameters of the circuit such as inductance L and capacitance C behave
as lumped elements at low frequencies and as distributed parameters at high frequencies where transmission

line techniques must be employed. The transition from lumped element to transmission line behavior depends
upon the risetime of the pulse Tr and on the total delay in the pulse transmission through the interconnection
Td. In the lumped element mode, the inductance and capacitance appear to the pulse to be concentrated at a
point. However, in the transmission line mode, inductance and capacitance appear to be uniformly distributed
throughout the interconnection; and as far as the pulse is concerned, the medium is inﬁnite in length, and all
the characteristics of wave propagation must be taken into consideration. Interestingly, similar techniques may
be used for electrical characterization of all of the interconnection elements such as wirebonds, package leads,
PCBs, connectors, and cables. The basic pulse transmission parameters of interest are propagation delay (Td),
characteristic impedance (Z0), reﬂection coefﬁcient (G), crosstalk (X), and risetime degradation (Tdr).
Propagation Delay (Td)
For a pulse being transmitted through a medium of length l and wave velocity v, delay Td ¼ l/v. The speed of
pulse transmission depends upon the dielectric constant of the material er and is given by v ¼ c0= ﬃﬃﬃer
p , where c0
is the speed of light in air ¼ 3 · 108 m/sec. Thus, propagation delay is proportional to length and also the
square root of the dielectric constant. In order to reduce delay and reduce machine cycle time and increase
speed, it is necessary to reduce the dielectric constant of the material. There is tremendous interest in
developing low dielectric constant materials for this reason.
Characteristic Impedance (Z0)
In general, a transmission line is any structure that propagates an electromagnetic wave from one point to
another. However, in the world of microwave, RF, or high-speed digital designs, the use of the term
transmission line is far more restrictive. In order for a structure to be a transmission line, the electrical length of
the (transmission) line must be much larger than the wavelength at the frequency of interest. For an
interconnection medium that behaves as a transmission line as shown in Figure 2.20, the characteristic
impedance is deﬁned as
Z0 ¼

where R ¼ series resistance (O/m), L ¼ series inductance (H/m), G ¼ shunt conductance (O1m1), C ¼ shunt
capacitance (F/m), and o ¼ 2pf ¼ radian frequency. In general, Z0 is complex, and the distributed per unit
length quantities R, L, G, and C must be determined from the material and structural characteristics of the
transmission line. For most applications, R ,, L, G ,, C, and

A digital pulse propagating in a circuit consists of voltages and currents of different frequencies (ac
components). A digital pulse is therefore an electromagnetic wave of many frequencies propagating down the
transmission line. In any circuit with transients (ac components), the current and voltage are not in phase
because of inductance and capacitance. In a pure inductor, voltage leads current by 90–, and in a pure
capacitor, voltage lags behind current by 90–. The total energy (WT) of the electromagnetic wave is made up of
the magnetic energy (Wm) and the electric energy (We). Magnetic energy is stored in inductance and is given
by Wm ¼ 1/2LI2, where I is the current. Similarly, electric energy is stored in its capacitance and is given by
1/2CV2. Therefore, the total energy is
WT ¼ Wm þ We ¼ 1
2 LI2 þ 1
2 CV2
ð2:25Þ
In an alternating ﬁeld, the total energy is continually being swapped between the magnetic and electrical
elements, one at the expense of the other. Because of the phase relationships discussed earlier, magnetic energy
is a maximum when electric energy is 0 and vice versa. Since it is the same stored energy that appears
alternately as magnetic and electrical energy, we can write
WT ¼ 1
2 LI2
max ¼ 1

ð2:26Þ
Therefore, Z0 ¼ Vmax=Imax ¼

.
Therefore, characteristic impedance Z0 gives the relationship between the maximum voltage and maximum
current in a transmission line and has the units of impedance (O). Thus, it is important to note that the
current required to drive a transmission line is determined by its characteristic impedance. Z0 is really the
impedance (resistance) to energy transfer associated with electromagnetic wave propagation. In fact,
characteristic impedance is not unique to electromagnetic waves alone. Characteristic impedance Z0 is an
important parameter associated with propagation of waves in a medium. Some examples are given below:
. Electromagnetic waves: Z0 ¼

Note that Z0 is a unique characteristic of material properties and geometry alone.
The performance of an interconnect that behaves as a transmission line is measured in terms of the efﬁciency of
energy (information) transfer from input to output, with minimal loss and dispersion effects. At high speeds, the
interconnect must maintain a uniform Z0 along the length of the signal. Any mismatch in characteristic
impedance across interconnect interfaces will cause reﬂection of the signal at the interface, which can cause errors
in digital circuits. Reﬂections are part of the losses in interconnect and lead to loss of information. These
reﬂections are sent back to the signal source. Therefore, multiple reﬂections from interfaces can distort the input
signal. The magnitude of reﬂection is deﬁned by the reﬂection coefﬁcient G, given by
G ¼ ZL  Z0
ZL þ Z0
ð2:27Þ
where ZL is the load impedance. Note that when the load and impedances are matched, Z0 ¼ ZL, reﬂection
coefﬁcient G ¼ 0, and the wave (energy, information) is transmitted without loss. For an open circuit, ZL ¼ 1,
and K ¼ 1. Thus, the entire pulse is reﬂected back to the source. For a short circuit, ZL ¼ 0, and K ¼ 1. Here, the
pulse is reﬂected back to the source with the same amplitude, but with the sign reversed. For practical purposes,
Z0 of PCBs may be considered to be independent offrequency up to nearly 1 GHz. In other words, PCBs may be
considered lossless transmission lines for impedance calculations. Beyond 1 GHz, the skin effect in conductors,
and dielectric and dispersion losses, cause signal degradation. Z0 is a parameter associated with PCBs and cables
2-32

but not with connectors at lower speeds, because of the deﬁnition of transmission line. The length of an electrical
path through a connector is approximately 1 in., which is very small compared to the wavelength at lower
frequencies. However, as speeds increase, the connector also has a Z0 associated with it. Otherwise, a connector
acts as a lumped L and C in a transmission path with its associated losses such as reﬂection and degradation. Z0
values for rectangular and circular transmission lines with and without ground planes applicable for cables are
given in Everitt (1970). We shall now look at evaluation of Z0 for typical PCB structures.
Z0 of PCB Structures.
The two commonly used PCB structures in electronic circuits are the microstrip
and stripline designs, shown in Figure 2.21 and Figure 2.22. In a pure microstrip, there is only one ground
plane below the conductor. The space below the conductor is ﬁlled with a dielectric material, and above the
conductor it is air. In most applications, however, the conductor traces are protected with a solder mask
coating of 2 to 3 mil thickness above it, as in Figure 2.23. This solder mask has the effect of reducing the Z0 of
FIGURE 2.21

the microstrip. In a pure microstrip, the electromagnetic wave is transmitted partially in the dielectric and
partially in air. Therefore, the effective dielectric constant is a weighted average between that of air and the
dielectric material. In a stripline design, the conductor is placed symmetrically between two ground planes and
the space ﬁlled with dielectric material. Thus, in a stripline, the wave is completely transmitted in the
dielectric. A variation of the stripline design is the asymmetric stripline where the conductor is closer to one
ground plane than the other, as in Figure 2.24.
For a microstrip transmission line structure, the characteristic impedance Z0 is given by Kaupp (1967):

The formulas given above are for Z0 of a single (isolated) line. As we shall see later, the presence of adjacent
lines alters the value of Z0. The appropriate line widths and the dielectric thicknesses required for Z0 in the
range of 50 to 75 O in glass epoxy FR4 boards with er ¼ 4.2 are shown in Table 2.9 and Table 2.10 for

microstrip and stripline. Also shown is the maximum crosstalk noise Xmax between two conductors in percent,
for a given spacing s between conductors in the same signal layer as in Figure 2.27 and Figure 2.38b.
An important observation from Table 2.9 and Table 2.10 is that the thickness of the dielectric for a
microstrip is considerably less than that of the stripline for the same Z0. Thus, microstrip structures lend
themselves to much thinner PCBs, and this is an advantage from a manufacturing point of view, since thicker
boards are more expensive to make. In practical PCBs, the traces are protected by a coat of solder mask (cover
coat). This cover coat is usually a dry ﬁlm or is screen printed and has an er < 4. Thus, we never have a classical
microstrip with air at the top, but rather a covered microstrip. The effect of the cover layer is to increase the
effective dielectric constant. Consequently, the capacitance of the line increases and Z0 decreases. The
reduction in Z0 with cover layer thickness is shown in Figure 2.25.
In practical situations, the thickness of the cover layer is < 3 to 4 mil, which can lead to a reduction in Z0 of
<10%. The covered microstrip can be considered to be a three dielectric layer problem, and the appropriate
line parameters may be evaluated by techniques given in Das and Prasad (1984). For most practical designs
today, the line width is typically 6 or 8 mil. There are some high-speed designs where 4-mil lines have been
used, where the technology is migrating due to the demand for high circuit and interconnection density. There
are some innovative design techniques that enable the user to attain high interconnection (circuit) density
without increasing the board thickness by a large amount. We noted earlier that the microstrip structure lends
itself to thinner dielectrics. However, the stripline provides a pure transverse electromagnetic (EM) wave and
the protection of two ground planes. We can combine the advantages of both of these structures by using the
asymmetric stripline.
To design a stripline with Z0 ¼ 50 O in FR4 material (er < 4.2) for a line width of 8 mil, we require a
dielectric thickness of 22 mil. Now consider a classical stripline with w ¼ 6 mil and b ¼ 18 mil. In FR4, Z0 < 51
O. If we now start moving one of the ground planes away from the line, Z0 increases up to a certain distance,
beyond which the line is not inﬂuenced by the presence of this ground plane. From Figure 2.26 we see that
when b2 is greater than 20 to 25 mil, the inﬂuence of this ground plane on Z0 is negligible. We can therefore
move the ground plane sufﬁciently far so as to have another signal plane to obtain an asymmetrical stripline as
shown in Figure 2.27.
Now for w ¼ 6 mil and b ¼ 22 mil, we obtain two signal layers, while with 8 mil and b ¼ 22 mil, we can only
get one signal layer. Thus, by going to an asymmetrical stripline design, we can almost double the
interconnection (circuit) density. There is the potential therefore to reduce an eight-layer multilayer board to
four layers. The penalty that we pay is in increased crosstalk, but that can be addressed by wider interline
spacing, as will be shown later.

Effect of Manufacturing Tolerances on Z0.
For high-speed systems, designers require a tight control on
impedance of boards. However, there is variation in Z0 because of manufacturing tolerances associated with
line w, t, dielectric thickness h or b, and with er. A common design requirement is that the variation in Z0 not
exceed 10%. In a manufacturing environment, the variation in the relevant parameters is random in nature.
We may therefore express the variation in Z0 as

These tolerance limits are shown in Figure 2.28 and Figure 2.29 for a microstrip of Z0 ¼ 75 O and for a
stripline of 50 O. The line width is 6 mil ( < 150 mm) and the values chosen for Z0 are of practical interest. The
limits of variation in Z0 are shown for a change in dielectric constant Der ¼ 0.1, which is very realistic for
variation in material properties. Also, dielectric constant for FR4 is not a constant, but varies with frequency as
shown in Figure 2.30, taken from measurements made by S. Mumby at Bell Laboratories.
We observe that er decreases with frequency, and that in the range of 100 Hz to 1 GHz, er decreases from 4.8
to 4, a change of < 20%. From the equations for Z0, we observe that it scales approximately as 1= ﬃﬃﬃer
p . Thus, a
change of 20% in er will result in < 14% change in Z0 as we go from 100 Hz to 1 GHz. This is just to point out
that er is not a constant but does vary slightly with frequency. In Figure 2.29 and Figure 2.30, it is clear that in
addition to a change of 0.1 in er, any variation in w (Dw) and dielectric thickness (Dh or Db) moves us up
along the contours to increase DZ0/Z0. The tolerance limits are shown for Dh or Db of 12.5, 25, and 50 mm

(0.5, 1, and 2 mil). In order to limit the Z0 tolerance to 10%, we need tight control over the manufacturing
process. Designers should be aware of the manufacturing tolerances of PCB manufacturing to determine the
ability to meet their controlled impedance requirements. These aspects are discussed in Ritz (1988).
Crosstalk (X)
Crosstalk may be deﬁned as noise that occurs on idle lines due to interactions with stray EM ﬁelds that
originate from active (pulsed) lines. This interaction is shown pictorially in Figure 2.31 and Figure 2.32.
There are two components to crosstalk. They are inductive crosstalk due to mutual inductance, Lm, and
capacitive crosstalk due to mutual capacitance, Cm. Inductive crosstalk is proportional to Lm dI/dt, and
FIGURE 2.29
Tolerance limits for stripline. Z0 ¼ 50 O, w ¼ 6 mil, t ¼ 1.4 mil, er ¼ 4.2.
FIGURE 2.30

capacitive crosstalk is proportional to Cm dV/dt. In any conductor in which we have a transient current
propagating perpendicular to the plane of the paper, circular magnetic ﬁeld lines are generated in space as
shown in Figure 2.31. Any conductor that interacts with this magnetic ﬁeld has crosstalk noise imposed on it
due to mutual inductive coupling Lm between the pulsed and the idle lines. Similarly, a transient voltage pulse
in the conductor generates radial electric ﬁelds emanating from the conductor as shown in Figure 2.32. An idle
line that interacts with this electric ﬁeld has crosstalk noise imposed on it due to mutual capacitance coupling
between the pulsed and idle lines. Thus, to predict crosstalk, we must be able to evaluate the mutual coupling
coefﬁcients Lm and Cm.
Consider a pulsed line and an idle line that are terminated in their characteristic impedances as shown in
Figure 2.33.
If we generate a digital pulse on the active pulsed line, then the crosstalk noise on the idle line is given by

The section of the line near the source is called the ‘‘near end’’ (NE), and the end of the line away from the
source is called the ‘‘far end’’ (FE). Note that the NE crosstalk noise VNE is the sum of the inductive and
FIGURE 2.31

capacitive components, while the FE crosstalk noise VFE is the difference between the capacitive and inductive
components. The crosstalk noise given by Equation (2.33) and Equation (2.34) is per unit length of the line.
Therefore, to evaluate the total crosstalk, we must multiply VNE and VFE by the length of coupling. This is
generally true for PCBs and cables where Lm and Cm are expressed in nH/m and pF/m. For a pure transverse
EM (TEM) wave propagation, Z0 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Lm=Cm
p
. Therefore, the inductive and capacitive crosstalk noise
components are equal, and VFE ¼ 0. However, in most practical applications, we do not have a pure TEM
wave, and the two components differ by a small amount. Therefore, in connectors and PCBs where the length
of coupling ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 in. for connectors, and about 10 to 20 in. for PCBs and backplanes, VFE < 0.
However, in cables that may run for several meters between equipment, the total FE crosstalk VFE can become
quite large since we are multiplying a small difference between capacitive and inductive crosstalk by a large
length. Thus, for connectors and PCBs, we are mainly interested in NE crosstalk noise VNE, but for cables, we
are interested in both VNE and VFE.
From Equation (2.33) and Equation (2.34) it is obvious that V depends on Lm, Cm, Z0, the rate of change of
current and voltage, dI/dt and dV/dt, respectively, and the length of coupling. What is of interest is to know
the shape and duration of both VNE and VFE. We shall see that the answer to this question depends upon the
relative magnitudes of the propagation delay in the line Td (which is proportional to length) and the risetime
of the pulse Tr in digital systems, or the frequency of the pulse for analog systems. The sign of the inductive
and capacitive noise components may be easily understood by looking at the simple mechanical analogy of the
spring–mass system. The inductive noise given by Lm dI/dt has the effect of inserting a voltage source VL in the
idle line as shown in Figure 2.34.
FIGURE 2.33
Crosstalk model showing near end and far end.
FIGURE 2.34
Inductive noise on idle line.

However, inductance has the effect of opposing the source current pulse. The source creates a clockwise loop
of current (action). Inductance behaves like the mechanical spring, which produces a reaction –kx to the
displacement x (action). So, as a reaction to the clockwise loop of current in the source line (action), mutual
inductance induces a counterclockwise loop of current in the idle line (reaction) to oppose the source pulse.
This therefore determines the polarity of the voltage source on the idle line as shown in Figure 2.34. It is this
voltage source that generates the counterclockwise loop of current. Therefore, we observe from Figure 2.34
that since the current ﬂows from the near end to ground, it must be positive with respect to ground. Similarly,
since the direction of current is from ground to far end, it must be negative with respect to ground. Thus, we
may observe from Equation (2.33) and Equation (2.34) that the inductive coupling term is positive at the near
end and negative at the far end. The current produced by mutual inductance is EL/2Z0. Therefore, the
inductive coupling noise at the near end and far end is given by VL
NE ¼ VL
FE ¼ EL=2, where EL ¼ LmdI/dt. For
the source line, we can write dI/dt < Vs / Z0Tr. Here, Vs is the magnitude of the source pulse, and Tr is the
risetime of the pulse.
Capacitive coupling has the effect of inserting a mutual capacitor Cm between the source and idle lines as
shown in Figure 2.35. The current that passes through Cm divides evenly in the idle line, with half going to
ground through the near end and the other half going to ground through the far end. Thus, the capacitive
crosstalk voltages at the near end and the far end are given by VNE
C ¼ VFE
C ¼ ICZ0/2. The coupled capacitive
current IC ¼ Cm dV/dt < CmVs/Tr. Therefore, mutual capacitance may be considered to be like mass (inertia)
in the mechanical spring–mass analogy. Mass (inertia) tends to keep going in the direction of displacement.
Similarly, mutual capacitance induces the same noise in both the near and far end as can be seen in Equation
(2.33) and Equation (2.34), and the sign of the noise is the same as dV/dt (inertia). The total crosstalk noise
(X) is due to inductive (XL) and capacitive (XC) noise and is usually expressed as a fraction of the input source
pulse Vs as X ¼ V/Vs. Therefore, for a coupling length of L, we can write crosstalk noise as

The expressions derived here are for noise in digital systems. It can be shown analytically and experimentally
(Rainal,1979)thatnear-endnoise,XNE,increaseswithlengthofcoupling,reachesamaximumvalue,andsaturates
there. Any increase in coupling length beyond a critical length will not increase the value of XNE. This critical

Equation (2.41) is the condition for transmission line behavior, that is, 2Td/Tr$1. Equation (2.42) is the limit
for lumped parameter analysis, that is, 2Td/Tr,1. Note that in the transmission line condition, XNE is
independent of risetime. For the transmission line condition (long coupling length as in cables and
backplanes), the shape of the near-end noise is trapezoidal, while for lumped parameter condition (as in
connectors), the shape of the near-end noise is triangular. These are clear in Figure 2.36a and b.
Also, we observe from Figure 2.36a that XNE reaches a maximum value and saturates there. It is instructive
to determine the lengths of lines for which transmission line characteristics are valid and when maximum
crosstalk occurs. If we consider FR4 glass epoxy boards for which er < 4, the wave speed v is < 1.5 · 108 m/sec
< 6 in./nsec, or the delay is 1/6 nsec/in. The lengths for which 2Td < Tr are shown in Table 2.12 for FR4 boards.
Note that for a risetime of 1 nsec, it only takes 3 in. of coupling for maximum crosstalk to occur. Thus,
while the near-end noise XNE has a maximum limit, far-end noise XFE given by Equation (2.38) increases
linearly with length. This is the reason that XFE is important for cables running over long distances. This is
obvious from Figure 2.36a, where near-end and far-end noise are almost of the same magnitude. Another very
important observation to be made from Figure 2.36a is that while the active pulse (source) leaves the source
line at time Td, the near-end noise has a width of 2Td. Thus, the crosstalk noise stays around for an extra time
delay Td, even though the active pulse causing the noise has already left the source line. However, observe that
far-end noise occurs as a single pulse at time Td. The reason for this phenomenon is that near-end coupling
occurs the moment the pulse enters the active line. As the source pulse travels on the active line, the coupled
noise on the idle line is sent back continuously to the near-end from every point of coupling between the two
lines. Therefore, there is a delay in the noise as it travels from a point of coupling back to the near-end.
As the coupled noise travels back to the near-end, the last portion of the noise that coupled at the end of the
active line (far end) has to travel back all the way to the near-end. It took the active pulse a time Td to reach
the end of the line, and it takes another Td for the coupled noise to travel back to the near end. Thus, the near-
end noise is continuously being sent back for a duration of time 2Td, even though the active pulse has left the
line at Td. This is why near-end crosstalk is also referred to as backward crosstalk. On the other hand, far-end
noise travels forward with the active pulse and appears as a single noise pulse at Td just as the active pulse
leaves the line. For this reason, far-end crosstalk is also referred to as forward crosstalk.
For a periodic signal, the crosstalk formulas are given in Rainal (1979) as
XNE ¼ 2KNEsinð2pfTdÞ
ð2:43Þ
XFE ¼ KFEð2pfLÞ
ð2:44Þ
2-43
Semiconductor Manufacturing

Note that the maximum value of near-end crosstalk for a periodic signal given by Equation (2.43) is twice that
obtained for a digital pulse. Also, the magnitude of XNE depends upon both the length of coupling (delay Td),
as well as frequency. Since XNE is sinusoidal, we can obtain greater crosstalk with smaller coupling length and
vice versa. Once again, far-end crosstalk increases linearly with coupling length, and in addition also increases
linearly with frequency. However, note that for both analog and digital signals, crosstalk noise XNE and XFE

depend upon the mutual coupling coefﬁcients Lm and Cm. Thus, the key to reducing crosstalk is to reduce
both Lm and Cm. The formulas given so far are for crosstalk due to a single source. If there are n sources
pulsing simultaneously, then the worst-case crosstalk on an idle line is given by
XTOTAL ¼ X1 þ X2 þ    þ Xn

Normally, XNE and XFE are measured experimentally using a time-domain reﬂectometer (TDR). From these
measured values, we may evaluate the capacitive crosstalk XC and inductive crosstalk XL as
XC ¼ 1

ð2:46aÞ
XL ¼ 1
2 ðXNE  XFEÞ
ð2:46bÞ
From these, we can evaluate the mutual coefﬁcients Lm and Cm, which enable us to scale the results for
crosstalk noise for different values of Tr, Td, L and Tr, or f. Lm and Cm may also be evaluated analytically for
many practical situations, and these will now be considered.
Expressions for Lm and Cm.
In order to analytically evaluate Lm and Cm, we use the coupled lines
techniques developed by microwave engineers. For this, we consider the two coupled lines to be in the odd and
even mode conﬁgurations as shown in Figure 2.37a and b for a microstrip design.
In the odd mode conﬁguration, the potential on one line is the negative potential of the other line, while in
the even mode, both lines have the same potential imposed upon them. Let Ca be the capacitance of an
isolated line to ground. Then, the odd and even mode capacitances, inductances, and characteristic
impedances are

these, we can then evaluate Lodd and Leven, and we may express the mutual coefﬁcients as

Mathematically, the odd and even mode impedances are the minimum and maximum values of impedances
for coupled lines. Observe that this change in impedance is due to the mutual coefﬁcients. This has

important implications in high-speed and high-density designs where many lines are closely spaced. The
very presence of an idle line in proximity alters Z0 of the line. Consider a completely isolated line
(alone) with its parameters Ca, La, and Za as in Figure 2.38a. Next consider one idle neighbor line as in
Figure 2.38b.
The presence of an idle line sets up a series capacitive path from active line to ground through mutual
coupling to idle line. Thus, with one idle neighbor line, capacitance increases from Ca to C1i given by
C1i ¼ Ca þ

ð2:48Þ
Thus, the presence of one idle neighbor increases the capacitance by < Cm. Similarly, the presence of two idle
neighbors increases capacitance by < 2Cm. However, in both cases, inductance remains the same as the
isolated line, La. Therefore, the impedances for one and two idle neighbors are given respectively as

Therefore, since the presence of idle lines increases capacitance, there is a reduction in characteristic
impedance, which may be important for controlled impedance lines. The decrease in impedance due to one
and two idle neighbor lines on a 50-O stripline design in FR4 (er ¼ 4.2, and t ¼ 1.2 mil) is shown in
Figure 2.39a for different line width and space (w/s in mil/mil) combinations. In Figure 2.39b are shown the
maximum crosstalk for the same w/s combinations. Observe that the shape of the lines in both ﬁgures is
identical. The larger the crosstalk, the greater will be the change in impedance. Thus, crosstalk and impedance
are related, and when we design for low crosstalk we are automatically designing for good impedance control.
Also, from Figure 2.39b we observe that to reduce crosstalk we must increase the space s between lines. As we
go from a 6/6 design to a 6/10 design, maximum crosstalk reduces from 7.5 to 3.5%, a reduction of 4%.
This has relevance to Figure 2.27 where we showed that the asymmetric stripline design lends itself to higher
interconnection density. We also noted that the penalty to be paid for moving one ground plane farther away
is increased crosstalk. However, by increasing s, we can reduce crosstalk and reduce this penalty. As shown
in Figure 2.40, as we change from a w/s design of 6/6 to 6/8, we get an almost uniform reduction of 2% in
maximum crosstalk. Thus, we can adjust the spacing to achieve crosstalk immunity. We should always keep
in mind that in addition to manufacturing tolerances, the presence of adjacent lines in dense boards has the
effect of altering Z0.
Noise in Connectors, IC Leads, and Wirebonds.
Unlike boards, backplanes, and cables, the lengths of
the signal paths in connectors, IC pins, and wirebonds are very short so that delay is small compared to
risetime. Therefore, they behave like lumped parameters. Therefore, near-end crosstalk noise is important. We
also noted that in a pure TEM wave, both inductive and capacitive noise contributions are almost equal, which
is appropriate for boards and cables. However, in connectors, pins, and wirebonds, the predominant noise
contribution is inductive in nature. Fortunately, inductive noise can be evaluated from some simple analytical
FIGURE 2.38a
Isolated line.

expressions that have been veriﬁed experimentally. However, to evaluate capacitive noise, we have to resort to
detailed ﬁeld solutions of the electromagnetic equations. This can be very complicated. However, from
measurements in connectors, we have determined that the maximum capacitive noise contribution is
<30% of XNE. In a practical situation, this may be <15 to 20%, which may be added to the inductive noise.
Inductive noise itself is made up of two components: noise due to self-inductance of the pins or wires and
noise due to mutual inductance between pins or wires. The mutual inductance, Lm (nH), between two wires of

Thus, inductive noise due to self-inductance can be signiﬁcant even in the presence of mutual inductance. It is
this phenomenon that gives rise to ground noise in connector pins and wire-bonds in IC packages and may be
as high as 100 mVor more (Rainal, 1984). This becomes an important issue in the allocation of ground return
leads or wires during the signal layout of connectors and ICs. The layout of a connector or IC leads
(wirebonds) consists of arrays or clusters of conductors. Of these, a certain number are allocated to signals and
the remaining to ground. In connectors, we are mainly interested in XNE on an idle signal pin, when one or
more of the adjacent signal lines are pulsed. If an array of n conductors are active, then the total noise on the
idle pin due to mutual coupling is given by

The model for noise evaluation in connectors and wirebonds is shown in Figure 2.41.
Note that ground noise becomes an important part of inductive noise. This phenomenon, also called
‘‘ground bounce,’’ can be a signiﬁcant problem when 16 or 32 signal bits are switched simultaneously in a chip.
For high-speed logic designs, ground noise must be kept to a minimum. This requires as many ground return
leads as possible. In addition, ground and signal leads must be closely alternated in a checkerboard pattern.
Keeping all the signals clustered in one region and all the grounds clustered in another region will cause
signiﬁcant ground noise problems (Rainal, 1984).
Risetime Degradation
When a pulse is passed through an interconnection element, there is an increase in the risetime of the pulse,
and this slowing down of the wave is referred to as risetime degradation. If the input risetime is Tri and the
output risetime is Tro, then risetime degradation Trd is deﬁned as

Thus, if we have a step input, the output risetime is Trd. If there are n interconnection elements, each with

This relationship is important because risetime degradation is not just the sum, but the square root of the sum
of squares. Thus, if Trd1 is 0.2 and Trd2 is 0.5, it is almost six times (0.25/0.04) more important than Trd1.
Therefore, attention should be paid to those elements that are most important. In general, risetime
degradation occurs due to resistive, inductive, and capacitive effects of circuits. In PCBs with long traces as
transmission lines, Trd is due to a combination of dc (IR loss) and skin effect. At very low frequencies, the
current ﬁlls the entire cross-section of the conductor. As we go to higher frequencies, the current is
concentrated in a very thin layer (skin) around the perimeter of the conductor. This thin layer is called skin

Skin effect slows down the signal and also lowers the magnitude of the pulse. For a copper conductor with
w ¼ 4 mil and t ¼ 2 mil, for a risetime of 0.5 nsec, skin effect becomes critical when the length of the trace
approaches 40 in. (Chang, 1988). Therefore, for most practical board designs today, the lossless line is a good
approximation.
Risetime degradation is important because it is related to the bandwidth (BW) of the interconnection
medium given as
BW ¼ 0:35
Trd
ð2:59Þ
The concept of bandwidth itself comes from low-pass RC ﬁlter theory. We know that the classical low-pass RC
ﬁlter passes low frequencies readily, but attenuates high frequencies. For this RC ﬁlter, the bandwidth is given
by f2 ¼ 1/2(pRC) and is the frequency at which the gain of the ﬁlter falls to 3 dB (70%) of the low-frequency
value. It is like a cutoff frequency and is a qualitative measure of the transfer of energy through the ﬁlter. If we
put a step input to the ﬁlter, the output from the ﬁlter is shown in Figure 2.42.
From theory, we can show that f2 ¼ 0.35/tr. Typically, good design requires that the interconnection loss be
limited to <1 dB. For connector characterization we pass a very fast pulse (almost a step input) and observe
the output pulse leaving the connector and its bandwidth expressed according to Equation (2.59).
The low-pass ﬁlter concept is very useful because most interconnection elements such as connectors,
short PCB traces, and IC package pins behave as low-pass ﬁlters. Since their lengths are relatively small
compared to pulse risetime, they act as lumped parameters and discontinuities along the transmission path.

The degradation of the signal is mainly due to capacitance and inductance of the pins and leads. The
appropriate model for such an interconnection discontinuity at a PCB IC package interface is shown in
Figure 2.43 (Rainal, 1988).
This generic model is valid for any interface, including connector and wirebonds or short PCB traces which
act as lumped elements. The interface is dominated by both parasitic capacitance and inductance of the signal
and ground leads. As the signal enters the interface, part of the energy is absorbed, part of it is reﬂected due to
the discontinuity, and the remaining is transmitted. This combination of events causes both an attenuation of
the magnitude of the pulse, as well as degradation of the risetime. Interestingly, all of the parameters of
interest, such as reﬂection, magnitude, and Trd, may be predicted from two nondimensional parameters.
These are
a ¼
L
R2C ¼ L=R
RC ;
b ¼ Tr
RC
ð2:60Þ
a is the ratio of inductive to capacitive time constants, b is a nondimensional risetime, and R is the
terminating resistor ¼ Z0. The results for various combinations of a and b are given in Figure (2.44),
Figure (2.45), and Figure (2.46) for the practical application of a high-speed chip package.
Other cases may be obtained from equations given in Rainal (1988). Typical values of L for PCB connectors
vary from 15 to 25 nH, and the capacitance varies from 1.5 to 2 pF. If the connector is placed on a 75-O line
through which we pass a pulse with a risetime Tr of 1 nsec, then for L ¼ 20 nH and C ¼ 2 pF, a < 1.8, and
b < 6.7. Therefore, from Figure 2.44, the maximum reﬂection coefﬁcient from the connector is 0.1 (10%).
Also, from Figure 2.45, for a 1-V input pulse, the output from the connector will only be 0.75 V (75%). Thus,
this connector conﬁguration may not be suitable for high-speed designs as we would like the reﬂection
coefﬁcient to be , 5% and the output voltage at least 80%. In addition, there is also the degradation of the
risetime. Note that this degradation of signal is just at the connector alone. In any interconnection medium,
there may be many interfaces at which signal distortion also occurs. The goal is to minimize distortion at every
interconnecting interface. Observe that the minimum reﬂection occurs for a ¼ 1, when L/R ¼ RC, or

‘‘matched’’ discontinuity. For a . 1, the interface may be considered inductive in nature, while it is capacitive
for a , 1. Thus, the reﬂection will be positive in one case and negative in the other. The a–b theory given
above also implies some important considerations. From Figure 2.45, we observe that b must be large to have a
high value for the output voltage. b may be made large by reducing C, but when we reduce C, we increase a,
and we observe that both the output voltage falls as a increases, and at the same time the reﬂection coefﬁcient

also increases. Therefore, just reducing C results in signal degradation. It is not possible to maintain signal
integrity by tuning either L or C alone. We need to specify joint bounds for L and C to minimize signal
degradation. These are discussed in Rainal (1988). This simple electrical model is a very practical tool for
evaluating interconnection elements for signal integrity.
Conclusions
This section is an overview of electrical characterization of interconnections and packaging (I&P) of
electronic systems. It is shown that I&P technology is mainly driven by advances in silicon IC technology,
such as VLSI where there has been a hundred-fold increase in component density per decade. Such a rapid
increase in silicon integration has also led to larger connections outside of the IC package, where the pin
count is dictated by the empirical Rent’s rule. Integration of such dense ICs in turn has led to multilayer
PCBs with increased track density and layer count. The signal traces from these dense multilayer boards
terminate on dense PCB connectors with 300 to 400 I/Os on an 8-in. height. The trend in electronics
packaging is toward both high speed and high density. I&P technology has therefore evolved at a rapid pace
along with the driving forces behind it.
The elements that make up I&P are the IC package with the wirebonds inside and the pins outside, PCB
with the conductor traces, and bias between the layers, PCB connector, motherboard with pins and conductor
traces, and cabling between boards and/or equipment. The elements of I&P are analogous to a mechanical
chain, with each element forming a link in the chain. The mechanical analogy may be extended further by
noting that the I&P chain is only as strong as the weakest link. As the signal travels from a driver to a receiver,
it passes through several interfaces between elements. There is signal degradation at every interface. I&P
should be designed so as to minimize the degradation at each interface. A high-performance IC may be
degraded due to improper interconnections. Today, I&P is the bottleneck to designing high-performance
electronic systems. Reliability of the system depends critically upon the integrity of the interconnection
scheme.
The important electrical parameters characterizing I&P are delay, characteristic impedance, crosstalk, and
risetime degradation. The article outlines the signiﬁcance of each of these parameters and techniques to
evaluate them. The electrical transmission path from driver to receiver is a very complicated one. It is
extremely difﬁcult to model the problem electrically from end to end. The best approach is to electrically
characterize each interface (element) individually for signal integrity. This breaks the problem down to simple
parts. The goal is to address those elements that are the cause of severe signal degradation and in the process

optimize the entire interconnection chain. Breaking the problem into individual elements identiﬁes the
important links. If the entire problem is solved from end to end, it is often difﬁcult to isolate those elements
that are the major cause of degradation. Fortunately, most of the electrical parameters can be evaluated using
simple analytical techniques that are readily available in literature. These have been used and veriﬁed
experimentally at Bell Labs in the design of many systems. In the design of high-speed PCBs, designers should
also consider the effect of manufacturing tolerances on electrical parameters, such as characteristic impedance.
Because of the increased speed and density requirements of many systems, careful electrical characterization
and optimization of I&P are the keys to system performance.

Microlithography for Microfabrication

Introduction
The advent of photolithography has shaped the latter part of the twentieth century, bringing about the
integrated circuit (IC) revolution. Almost all electronic devices used today have one or more ICs inside. More
advanced lithography led to smaller and smaller transistors, which translated into faster and more efﬁcient
computing machines. Photolithography also powered the advent of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),
which are now starting to be used in more and more diverse commercial products, from mechanical to
biomedical devices, and are helping to change the way people perceive the applicability of IC technology. This
chapter examines the basics of the photolithography process. It also addresses current and future lithography
trends toward further decreasing the minimum feature size, allowing the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio
structures and facilitating the introduction of new processes and materials. These are all contributing factors to
the continued expansion of application domains for IC technology.
Photolithography
In this section, a succinct overview of the photolithography process is presented. The reader is referred to
Madou’s Fundamentals of Microfabrication [1] for a more detailed description.
History of Lithography
The word lithography (Greek for the words ‘‘stone [lithos]’’ and ‘‘to write [graphein]’’) refers to a process
invented in 1796 by Aloys Senefelder. Senefelder discovered that stone (in his case, Bavarian limestone), when
properly inked and treated with chemicals, could transfer a carved image onto paper [2].
By the early 1960s, methods were devised whereby a photoetching process produced large numbers of
transistors on a thin slice of silicon (Si). At that time, pattern resolution was no better than 5 mm [3]. Today,
photolithography, x-ray lithography, and charged-particle lithography all achieve submicron printing
accuracy. The 64-bit PowerPC 970FX chip, available from IBM Corp. and introduced in 2004, has a minimum
feature size of 90 nm, a core speed of 2 GHz, and 58 million transistors. It also incorporates advanced Si
technologies such as SOI and strained silicon [4].

Photolithography Overview
The most widely used form of lithography is photolithography. In the IC industry, pattern transfer from
masks onto thin photosensitive ﬁlms is accomplished almost exclusively by photolithography. In this
process, a pattern is transferred to a photosensitive polymer (a photoresist) by exposure to a light source
through an optical mask. An optical mask usually consists of opaque patterns (usually chrome or iron
oxide) on a transparent support (usually quartz) that is used to deﬁne features on a wafer. The photoresist
pattern is then transferred to the underlying substrate by subtractive (etching) or additive (deposition)
techniques. The combination of the accurate alignment of a successive set of photomasks and the exposure
of these successive patterns leads to complex, multilayered ICs or micromachines. Photolithography has
matured rapidly in the ability to resolve ever smaller features. For the IC industry, this continued
improvement in resolution has impeded the adoption of alternative, higher-resolution lithography
techniques, such as x-ray lithography and other next-generation lithography (NGL) techniques. Research in
high-aspect-ratio resist features, driven by the ﬁeld of MEMS, is also being actively pursued, as opposed to
the essentially two-dimensional processes used in traditional IC manufacturing.
Photolithography and pattern transfer involve a set of process steps that are summarized in Figure 2.47. As
an example, an oxidized Si wafer and a negative photoresist are used to transfer a pattern from a mask to a
layer of silicon dioxide. An oxidized wafer (A) is coated with a 1-mm thick negative photoresist layer (B). After
exposure (C), the wafer is rinsed in a developing solution or sprayed with a spray developer, to remove the
unexposed areas of photoresist and leave a pattern of bare and photoresist-coated oxide on the wafer surface
(D). The resulting photoresist pattern is the negative image of the photomask pattern. In a typical next step
after development, the wafer is placed in a solution of HF or a mixture of HF and NH4F that attacks the oxide
at a much faster rate than the photoresist or the underlying silicon (E). The photoresist prevents the oxide
underneath from being attacked. Once the exposed oxide has been etched away, the remaining photoresist can
be stripped off with a solution that only attacks the photoresist such as a strong acid, for instance, H2SO4, or
an acid–oxidant combination such as Piranha (H2SO4:H2O2) (F). Other liquid strippers include organic
solvent strippers and alkaline strippers (with or without oxidants). The oxidized Si wafer with the etched
windows in the oxide (F) now awaits further processing. Recently, photoresists have been increasingly used
in applications where the resist is a permanent part of the ﬁnal device rather than just a sacriﬁcial layer for
patterning the substrate.
Wafer Preparation
Wafer Cleaning.
All lithography processes used in manufacturing take place inside a semiconductor clean
room, a specially constructed enclosed area with yellow lighting. The clean room is environmentally controlled
with respect to airborne particulates, temperature (^0.1–F), air pressure, humidity (from 0.5 to 5% relative
humidity [RH]), and vibration. Airborne contaminants are especially detrimental to the fabrication process
yield. The number of usable devices out of the total number of manufactured devices is crucial to the
economic viability of the ﬁnal product. Physical contaminants such as dust particles can hinder the
lithography process by preventing light from exposing the photoresist or by disturbing the surface uniformity
of a coated photoresist. Chemical contaminants can react with various materials used in the lithography
process to create unwanted effects.
Silicon is the material of choice for today’s microfabrication, but there is a trend toward different substrate
materials, especially in BioMEMS. A variety of cleaning methods can be used to prepare a wafer for the
lithography process. Usually, new wafers are already cleaned before shipping and are kept in a contamination-
free container. If cleaning of the wafer is needed, a variety of methods (HF dip, RCA1, RCA2, Piranha clean,
etc.) can remove different types of contaminants. The presence of water or water vapor compromises the
adhesion between the photoresist and the wafer. Before the photoresist is applied, a dehydration bake is
performed to remove water from the wafer surface. Adhesion can be further promoted by applying an
adhesion promoter (hexamethyldisilizane [HMDS]) or by roughening the wafer surface by plasma etching.
This is referred to as wafer priming.

Semiconductor Manufacturing

Oxide Growth.
In many cases, an oxide layer is desired as a mask for subsequent processes (for example,
an etch or an implant process) or as an insulating layer. This is usually done by heating a silicon wafer to
between 900 and 1150–C in a dry or humidiﬁed oxygen stream in a tube furnace.
Resist Spinning and Soft Bake
As the ﬁrst step in the lithography process itself, a thin layer of an organic polymer, a photoresist sensitive to
ultraviolet radiation, is deposited on the oxide surface (Figure 2.47B). The liquid photoresist is dispensed onto a
wafer held by a vacuum chuck in a resist spinner. The wafer is then spun in one or more steps at precisely
controlled speeds. The spin speed (between 1500 and 8000 rpm) allows the formation of a uniform ﬁlm. At these
speeds, the centrifugal force causes the liquid to ﬂow to the edges, where it builds up until expelled when the
surfacetension is exceeded. The resulting polymer thickness, T, is a function of spin speed, solution concentration
and molecular weight (measured by intrinsic viscosity). The empirical expression for T is given by

where K ¼ overall calibration constant, C ¼ polymer concentration in g/100 ml solution, Z ¼ intrinsic
viscosity, and o ¼ rotations per minute (rpm).
Once the various exponential factors (a, b, and g) have been determined, Equation (2.61) can be used to
predict the ﬁlm thickness for various molecular weights and solution concentrations of a given polymer and
solvent system [5].
The spinning process is of primary importance to the effectiveness of pattern transfer. The quality of the
resist coating determines the density of defects transferred to the device being made. The resist-ﬁlm uniformity
across a single substrate and from substrate to substrate must be ^ 5 nm (for a 1.5-mm ﬁlm, this is ^ 0.3%) to
ensure reproducible line widths and development times in subsequent steps.
After spin coating, the resist still contains up to 15% solvent and may have built-in stresses. The wafers
are therefore soft-baked (prebaked) at 75 to 100–C to remove solvents and stress, and to promote adhesion
of the resist layer to the wafer. The optimization of this prebaking step may substantially increase device
yield.
Exposure and Postexposure Treatment
Pattern transfer onto a photoresist is done by shining light through the mask (Figure 2.47C). In
photolithography, wavelengths of the light source used for exposure of the resist-coated wafer range from the
very short wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light (EUV) (10 to 14 nm) to longer wavelengths such as deep
ultraviolet (DUV) (150 to 300 nm) and near-ultraviolet (UV) (350 to 500 nm) light. In near-UV, one typically
uses the g-line (435 nm) or i-line (365 nm) of a mercury lamp. For a projection lithography system (with
lenses), the theoretical resolution limit is given by the Rayleigh expression [1,6]:
R ¼ 0:61l
2NA
ð2:62Þ
where R ¼ minimum achievable resolution, l ¼ wavelength of exposure source, and NA ¼ numerical aperture:
NA ¼ nsiny
ð2:63Þ
where n ¼ index of refraction of the ambient and sin y ¼ the angular half-aperture of the lens.
In general, the smallest feature that can be printed using projection lithography is roughly equal to the
wavelength of the exposure source. For a KrF excimer laser, 248 nm would be the expected minimum feature
size. Resolution enhancement techniques (RET), discussed below, are used to go beyond the conventional
Rayleigh diffraction limit. Smaller features require shorter wavelengths but as the wavelength becomes
shorter, it becomes difﬁcult to manufacture lenses that can transmit the light efﬁciently due to absorption.
Thus, the projection system must be circumvented completely (as in the case of x-ray lithography), or
reﬂective optics must be used (EUV lithography). At short wavelengths, there is also a lack of reliable light
sources of sufﬁcient quality and power output. Next-generation lithography (NGL) schemes will be discussed
below.
The action of light on a photoresist either increases or decreases the resist solubility, depending on whether
a positive or negative photoresist is applied. Thus, for a positive-tone photoresist, the opaque pattern on the
mask will determine the features remaining in the resist layer after development (Figure 2.48). Conversely,
after development of a negative photoresist, the clear pattern of the mask determines the remaining
photoresist features (Figure 2.48). The proﬁle of the photoresist side walls (Figure 2.49) is critical to many
applications, such as the patterning of hard-to-etch metals (lift-off) and mold fabrication. Figure 2.50
illustrates the use of a lift-off proﬁle. The resist wall proﬁle can be controlled by adjusting resist tone, exposure
dose, developer strength, development time, and by other means.
Post exposure treatment is often desired because the reactions initiated during exposure might not have
been completed. To halt the reactions or to induce new ones, several postexposure treatments can be
2-59
Semiconductor Manufacturing

used: postexposure baking, ﬂood exposure with other types of radiation, treatment with reactive gas, and
vacuum treatment.
Development, Descumming, and Postbaking
During the development process, selective dissolving of resist takes place (Figure 2.47D). Development can
be done using a liquid (wet development), a gas, or a plasma (dry development). Positive resists are
typically developed in aqueous alkaline solutions (such as tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide [TMAH]), and
negative resists in organic solvents. Dry development methods have some advantages over wet methods,
including less swelling of the resist and environmental friendliness. These dry methods are becoming more
prevalent.
Unwanted, residual photoresist sometimes remains after development. Descumming is a procedure for
removing unwanted photoresist with a mild plasma treatment. In this process, highly energetic oxygen ions
bombard the sample surface and physically etch away the unwanted photoresist.
Postbaking or hard baking removes residual solvents and anneals the ﬁlm to promote interfacial adhesion of
the resist that has been weakened either by developer penetration along the resist/substrate interface or by

swelling of the resist (mainly for negative resists). Hard baking also improves the hardness of the ﬁlm.
Improved hardness increases the resistance of the resist to subsequent etching and deposition steps. Postbaking
is usually done at higher temperatures (120–C) and for longer time periods (e.g., 20 min) than soft baking or
prebaking.
Pattern Transfer
In cases where the photoresist is a permanent part of the ﬁnal device (microﬂuidics, C-MEMS, etc.), further
processing may not be needed. However, in most cases, the sacriﬁcial photoresist pattern is used as a mask for
etching (subtractive) or deposition (additive) of or on the underlying substrate (Figure 2.47E shows a
subtractive process). In a subtractive process, the resist acts as a protective barrier to the etching agent, which
can be a liquid solution, a gas, or a plasma. After pattern transfer, the resist can be removed for further
processing. Similarly, pattern transfer can involve a deposition technique: chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or
e-beam evaporation.
Current and Future Trends
The electronics and photonics industries are interested in developing new nanolithography methods in order
to continue the long-term trend of building ever smaller, faster, and less expensive devices (Moore’s law).
Conventional projection lithography is based on the 4 · reduction of reticle features and is limited by optical
diffraction, where the smallest feature size achievable is approximately the order of the wavelength of the
radiation source [1]. For wavelengths shorter than 157 nm, refractive optics are not suitable because of the
strong absorption of shorter wavelengths by the optics elements. Much more expensive and demanding
reﬂective optics are needed when shorter-wavelength light sources are used.
There is no clear consensus as yet on what the favored next generation lithography process for IC
manufacturing will be, although extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography seems to be the leading contender.
On a research level, there are many technologies that are competing. EUV lithography, x-ray lithography,

e-beam and ion-beam lithography, soft lithography, and proximal probe lithography are all potential
contenders in this crowded arena. These lithography methods, all of them, signiﬁcantly different from current
lithography processes, are called NGL systems.
EUV Lithography
The most logical extension of the lithography used today is to move to shorter wavelengths. EUV systems use
13.4-nm radiation in a vacuum environment with an all-reﬂective optical exposure station to fabricate devices
and structures with sub-70-nm dimensions. Some major challenges involve the fabrication of highly reﬂective,
multilayer coatings for the optics and the synthesis of new resists to work in this speciﬁc wavelength regime
[7–9]. In 1997, a U.S. consortium called the Extreme Ultraviolet Limited Liability Company (EUV LLC) was
created to spearhead research to bring EUV lithography to market. The consortium includes Intel Corp.,
Motorola Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Corp., IBM, Inﬁneon Technologies AG, Micron Technology Inc.,
and the Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. The work so far has led to a prototype EUV
lithography chip-making machine, but there are still many obstacles to overcome to achieve sufﬁcient yield in
a manufacturing setting [10,11].
Resolution Enhancement Technologies (RET)
RET are not part of NGL technology, but they have enabled the semiconductor industry to continue
miniaturization using current photolithography technologies. Resolution enhancement technologies such as
phase shift masks (PSM)[11] (Figure 2.51), off-axis illumination (OAI) [11], optical proximity correction
(OPC)[11] (Figure 2.52), and liquid immersion lithography (Figure 2.53)[6,12,13] and interferometric
lithography [14] all enable the writing of photoresist features with dimensions smaller than the wavelength of
the exposing light source. Although RET is extensively used in current IC manufacturing, the added
manpower, extra computing and databases, software and technology licensing is expensive [15]. RET
technologies have delayed the transition to NGLs, but because of cost and other limitations, the transition to
NGL systems is inevitable.
Serial Lithography Schemes (Proximal Probe, E-beam, and Ion Beam)
Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) [16,17], scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [18,19], near-ﬁeld
scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) [20,21], apertureless near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy (ANSOM)
[22], electron-beam lithography (EBL), ion beam lithography (IBL), ‘‘dip-pen’’ nanolithography [23], and
other sequential writing schemes, smaller features can be deﬁned than with photolithography. However, these
technologies are too expensive to implement, and because of their serial nature, they are also too slow to be
practical. Arrays of these serial-writing tools have been investigated, but in the case of the proximal probe
approach (AFM, STM, NSOM, ANSOM), tip stability is an issue that needs to be resolved, as demonstrated by
FIGURE 2.51

the work on IBM’s AFM arrays (the so-called millipede [24,25]). EBL is commonly used in the prototyping of
devices with ﬁne features and in making masks for production projection systems, but the technology is
considered too slow to be used in a manufacturing setting.
SCALPEL
Systems that use electrons in a ﬂood-exposure mode instead of in a ﬁne beam have also been developed. In this
method, an electron source is used as a ‘‘light’’ source for projection lithography. The lenses in a conventional
FIGURE 2.52

are line ends to compensate for the lack of exposure, and serif-corner correction features (more transmissive) are added to
compensate for the unneeded exposure within the inner corners.
FIGURE 2.53
Illustration of resolution enhancement using immersion lithography. Using liquid (water) as the separating
medium between the focusing lens and the photoresist permits the use of higher numerical apertures, with less degradation
in the depth of focus as compared to having air as the separating medium. From Equation (2.62) and Equation (2.63), an
n-fold increase in index of refraction results in an n-fold increase in resolution.

projection lithography system are replaced by magnetic ‘lenses.’ The method, called scattering with angular
limitation projection electron-beam lithography (SCALPEL)[26–30] has many advantages over conventional
lithography, including smaller features and better depth-of-focus, but the price of mask fabrication and of the
equipment is a major disadvantage.
Imprint Lithography
Imprint lithography techniques all incorporate an imprint step, where the topography of a template deﬁnes
patterns created on a substrate. The three main approaches to imprint lithography are soft lithography
[33–35], nanoimprint lithography (NIL) [31], and step-and-ﬂash imprint lithography (SFIL) [31]
(Figure 2.54). Imprinting processes are economical due to the simplicity of the equipment and the potential
for high throughput. As the rate of improvements in optical lithography decelerates and as the costs of
manufacturing continue to escalate, there is increased interest in printing and molding as alternative
processes for microfabrication. As imprint lithography depends on another lithography technique (perhaps
an NGL) to make the master, it does not really qualify as an NGL itself. Resolutions of sub-10 nm have been
achieved using imprint techniques [32]. In most cases, imprint lithography resolution is only limited by the
resolution of the template-fabrication process.
Soft lithography[33–35] refers to a series of methods that use a patterned elastomer as a stamp, mold, or
mask to generate micropatterns and microstructures instead of using a rigid photomask. These methods
include replica molding (REM), microcontact printing (mCP), micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC), and
micro-transfer molding (mTM) [36]. The major advantage of soft lithography is its short turn-around time.
FIGURE 2.54
Illustration of imprint lithography methods: soft lithography or microcontact printing (mCP),
nanoimprint lithography (NIL), and step-and-ﬂash imprint lithography (SFIL). All these techniques can result in
features only as good as those used in the imprint template. While the ﬁdelity of soft lithography is compromised by the
use of a ﬂexible stamp (PDMS), NIL and SFIL faithfully duplicate the ﬁnest features of the template.
2-64
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

It is possible to go from design to production of replicated structures in less than 24 hours. The method is low
in cost and, unlike photolithography, is applicable to almost all polymers and, thus, many materials that can be
prepared from polymeric precursors. Since soft materials are used, deformation of the stamp/mold, low
reproducibility (due to distortion), and defects (yield) are problems that prevent this technology from being a
viable manufacturing technique [33]. The process constitutes a very handy research tool but most likely will
not reach the commercial manufacturing stage.
NIL [31,50] and SFIL [31,37] are techniques that use hard molds instead of soft molds. In NIL, a template
made of a hard material (usually Ni or Si) is pressed against a polymer layer. High temperature and pressure
conditions mold and harden the polymer layer. In SFIL, a hard-but-transparent template is used to mold a
photoresist. The photoresist is exposed to light through the template to harden the resist. Although more
progress is needed for widespread adoption of NIL and SFIL, sub-100-nm feature-size devices can be reliably
fabricated at a reasonable throughput. It has been demonstrated that the mold templates do not deteriorate,
even after 1500 imprints with sub-100-nm feature sizes [38].
MEMS
MEMS, or the science of miniaturization, refers to a class of devices that have at least one of their dimensions
in the micrometer range. While IC devices only use electrical components (transistors, diodes, capacitors,
etc.), MEMS devices take advantage of a wide range of other equipment, from mechanical to biological
(BioMEMS). The materials and fabrication methods used in MEMS are much more varied than those used for
IC fabrication (where one deals principally with silicon, oxides, and metals patterned using photolithography).
In contrast to the IC industry, where the devices are carefully packaged and protected from the environment,
MEMS devices, such as pressure or glucose sensors, often must have surfaces directly exposed to the sensing
environment. Examples of successfully commercialized mechanical devices are accelerometers, gyroscopes, tilt
meters, membrane-pressure sensors, micromirrors, optical MEMS switches, and inkjet-print heads.
Commercial BioMEMS devices include glucose sensors and DNA arrays. Because of the irreversible chemical
reactions involved and contamination considerations, BioMEMS devices tend to be disposable.
Nonplanar Lithography
In many MEMS and BioMEMS applications, nonplanar geometries are required. True 3D structures (with
actual 3D curves) can be built using stereolithography [39–42] and holographic lithography [43,44].
Stereolithography has a very short turn-around time and is relatively inexpensive. It is an alternative to the
LIGA process (see next section) for prototyping three-dimensional structures when dimensional accuracy is
not critical.
Lithographie Galvanoformung und Abformtechnik (LIGA, the German acronym for x-ray lithography
[x-ray lithographie], electrodeposition [galvanoformung], and molding [abformtechnik]) [45,46] is a process
that was devised to create very precise and high-aspect-ratio structures. The process, illustrated in Figure 2.55,
involves a thick layer of x-ray resist (from microns to centimeters), high-energy x-ray radiation exposure and
development to arrive at a three-dimensional resist structure. Subsequent metal deposition ﬁlls the resist
mold with a metal and, after resist removal, a freestanding metal structure results. The metal shape may be a
ﬁnal product or serve as a mold insert for precision plastic molding. The lack of x-ray sources and the high
cost of LIGA masks has led many researchers toward development of LIGA-like processes that result in 3D,
high-aspect-ratio structures. One of these methods is the use of SU-8 negative photoresist (MicroChem,
Newton, MA). SU-8 is a chemically ampliﬁed negative photoresist with high transparency. This allows light to
penetrate through thick layers of photoresist. Because thick layers of photoresist can be exposed with near-
vertical sidewall proﬁles, SU-8 photoresist is commonly called the ‘‘poor man’s LIGA.’’ SU-8 structures have
been used as molds for microﬂuidic applications. In these applications, PDMS is poured onto the patterned
SU-8 mold, then the PDMS is cured, removed, and pressed or bonded onto a ﬂat substrate to create
microchannels. Figure 2.56 shows an SEM photo of a PDMS microchannel for a microﬂuidic system.

Nontraditional Materials
Different materials that are being used or investigated for use in MEMS processes include polymers, ceramics,
nitinol (shape memory alloys), biomaterials, and carbon. The Madou research group at UCI [47] has been
pursuing research in carbon MEMS (C-MEMS) derived from pyrolysed photoresist. Patterned SU-8
photoresist is converted into carbon electrodes by subjecting the photoresist to high temperatures in an inert
environment in a process called pyrolysis. C-MEMS electrodes can be easily shaped into complex 3D
geometries that were previously difﬁcult or expensive to fabricate using conventional carbon-electrode

fabrication methods. The electrochemical properties of carbon make it an excellent electrode material [48].
High-aspect-ratio carbon structures (Figure 2.58) can be obtained from SU-8 photoresist structures (Figure
2.57). These high-aspect-ratio carbon structures are being evaluated for their potential use in batteries, and
chemical and bio-sensing applications.
Summary and Conclusion
In this section, we introduced various microlithography techniques, as well as some fundamentals of
microfabrication. The application domain of lithography has expanded beyond the IC world to encompass the
fabrication of mechanical and biological devices. The fact that some DNA arrays are now made through
lithography illustrates this point. With the advent of MEMS, different materials and high-aspect-ratio
fabrication techniques have been introduced. Photolithography is continuously merging with traditional
manufacturing techniques such as molding and electroplating (including LIGA and imprint lithography). The
ﬁeld of microfabrication is so vast that it would be impossible to offer a comprehensive review within the space
limitations of this section. The reader is referred to textbooks [1,49] and recent reviews for a more thorough
investigation.

Junction Field-Effect Transistors
Sidney Soclof
A junction ﬁeld-effect transistor (JFET) is a type of transistor in which the current ﬂow through the device
between the drain and source electrodes is controlled by the voltage applied to the gate electrode. A simple
physical model of the JFET is shown in Figure 3.1. In this JFET an n-type conducting channel exists between
drain and source. The gate is a pþ region that surrounds the n-type channel. The gate-to-channel pn-junction
is normally kept reverse-biased. As the reverse bias voltage between gate and channel increases, the depletion
region width increases, as shown in Figure 3.2. The depletion region extends mostly into the n-type channel
because of the heavy doping on the pþ side. The depletion region is depleted of mobile charge carriers and
thus cannot contribute to the conduction of current between drain and source. Thus, as the gate voltage
increases, the cross-sectional areas of the n-type channel available for current ﬂow decreases. This reduces the
current ﬂow between drain and source. As the gate voltage increases, the channel gets further constricted and
the current ﬂow gets smaller. Finally, when the depletion regions meet in the middle of the channel, as shown
in Figure 3.3, the channel is pinched off in its entirety between source and drain. At this point the current ﬂow
between drain and source is reduced to essentially zero. This voltage is called the pinch-off voltage, VP.
The pinch-off voltage is also represented by VGS (off) as being the gate-to-source voltage that turns the
3-1

drain-to-source current IDS off. We have been considering here an n-channel JFET. The complementary
device is the p-channel JFET that has an nþ gate region surrounding a p-type channel. The operation of a
p-channel JFET is the same as for an n-channel device, except the algebraic signs of all dc voltages and
currents are reversed.
We have been considering the case for VDS small compared to the pinch-off voltage such that the channel
is essentially uniform from drain to source, as shown in Figure 3.4(a). Now let us see what happens as VDS
increases. As an example let us assume an n-channel JFET with a pinch-off voltage of VP ¼ 4 V. We will
see what happens for the case of VGS ¼ 0 as VDS increases. In Figure 3.4(a) the situation is shown for the
case of VDS ¼ 0 in which the JFET is fully ‘‘on’’ and there is a uniform channel from source to drain. This is
at point A on the IDS vs. VDS curve of Figure 3.5. The drain-to-source conductance is at its maximum value
of gds (on), and the drain-to-source resistance is correspondingly at its minimum value of rds (on). Now let
us consider the case of VDS ¼ þ1 V, as shown in Figure 3.4(b). The gate-to-channel bias voltage at the
source end is still VGS ¼ 0. The gate-to-channel bias voltage at the drain end is VGD ¼ VGS  VDS ¼ 1 V,
so the depletion region will be wider at the drain end of the channel than at the source end. The channel
will thus be narrower at the drain end than at the source end, and this will result in a decrease in the
channel conductance gds and, correspondingly, an increase in the channel resistance rds. So the slope of the
IDS vs. VDS curve that corresponds to the channel conductance will be smaller at VDS ¼ 1 V than it was at
VDS ¼ 0, as shown at point B on the IDS vs. VDS curve of Figure 3.5.
In Figure 3.4(c) the situation for VDS ¼ þ2 V is shown. The gate-to-channel bias voltage at the source end
is still VGS ¼ 0, but the gate-to-channel bias voltage at the drain end is now VGD ¼ VGS  VDS ¼ 2 V, so the
depletion region will now be substantially wider at the drain end of the channel than at the source end. This
leads to a further constriction of the channel at the drain end, and this will again result in a decrease in the
channel conductance gds and, correspondingly, an increase in the channel resistance rds. So the slope of the IDS
vs. VDS curve will be smaller at VDS ¼ 2 V than it was at VDS ¼ 1 V, as shown at point C on the IDS vs. VDS
curve of Figure 3.5.
In Figure 3.4(d) the situation for VDS ¼ þ3 V is shown, and this corresponds to point D on the IDS vs. VDS
curve of Figure 3.5.
When VDS ¼ þ4 V, the gate-to-channel bias voltage will be VGD ¼ VGS  VDS ¼ 0  4 V ¼ 4 V ¼ VP. As a
result the channel is now pinched off at the drain end but is still wide open at the source end since VGS ¼ 0, as
FIGURE 3.2
FIGURE 3.1
FIGURE 3.3

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

shown in Figure 3.4(e). It is very important to note that the channel is pinched off just for a very short distance
at the drain end so that the drain-to-source current IDS can still continue to ﬂow. This is not at all the same
situation as for the case of VGS ¼ VP, where the channel is pinched off in its entirety, all the way from source to
drain. When this happens, it is like having a big block of insulator the entire distance between source and
drain, and IDS is reduced to essentially zero. The situation for VDS ¼ þ4 V ¼ VP is shown at point E on the
IDS vs. VDS curve of Figure 3.5.
For VDS . þ4 V, the current essentially saturates and does not increase much with further increases in VDS.
As VDS increases above þ4 V, the pinched-off region at the drain end of the channel gets wider, which
increases rds. This increase in rds essentially counter-
balances the increase in VDS such that IDS does not
increase much. This region of the IDS vs. VDS curve in
which the channel is pinched off at the drain end is
called the active region and is also known as the
saturated region. It is called the active region because
when the JFET is to be used as an ampliﬁer, it should
be biased and operated in this region. The saturated
value of drain current up in the active region for the
case of VGS ¼ 0 is called the drain saturation
current, IDSS (the third subscript S refers to IDS under
FIGURE 3.4
FIGURE 3.5

the condition of the gate shorted to the source). Since
there is not really a true saturation of current in the
active region, IDSS is usually speciﬁed at some value of
VDS. For most JFETs, the values of IDSS fall in the range
of 1 to 30 mA.
The region below the active region where VDS , þ4 V
¼ VP has several names. It is called the nonsaturated
region, the triode region, and the ohmic region.
The term triode region apparently originates from the
similarity of the shape of the curves to that of the
vacuum tube triode. The term ohmic region is due to
the variation of IDS with VDS as in Ohm’s law, although this variation is nonlinear except for the region of VDS
that is small compared to the pinch-off voltage where IDS will have an approximately linear variation with VDS.
The upper limit of the active region is marked by the onset of the breakdown of the gate-to-channel pn-
junction. This will occur at the drain end at a voltage designated as BVDG, or BVDS, since VGS ¼ 0. This
breakdown voltage is generally in the 30- to 150-V range for most JFETs.
So far we have looked at the IDS vs. VDS curve only for the case of VGS ¼ 0. In Figure 3.6 a family of curves of
IDS vs. VDS for various constant values of VGS is presented. This is called the drain characteristics, also known as
the output characteristics, since the output side of the JFET is usually the drain side. In the active region where
IDS is relatively independent of VDS, a simple approximate equation relating IDS to VGS is the square-law
transfer equation as given by IDS ¼ IDSS[1  (VGS/VP)]2. When VGS ¼ 0, IDS ¼ IDSS as expected, and as VGS !
VP, IDS ! 0. The lower boundary of the active region is controlled by the condition that the channel be
pinched off at the drain end. To meet this condition the basic requirement is that the gate-to-channel bias
voltage at the drain end of the channel, VGD, be greater than the pinch-off voltage VP. For the example under
consideration with VP ¼ 4 V, this means that VGD ¼ VGS  VDS must be more negative than 4 V. Therefore,
VDS  VGS > þ4 V. Thus, for VGS ¼ 0, the active region will begin at VDS ¼ þ4 V. When VGS ¼ 1 V, the
active region will begin at VDS ¼ þ3 V, for now VGD ¼ 4 V. When VGS ¼ 2 V, the active region begins at
VDS ¼ þ2 V, and when VGS ¼ 3 V, the active region begins at VDS ¼ þ1 V. The dotted line in Figure 3.6
marks the boundary between the nonsaturated and active regions.
The upper boundary of the active region is marked by the onset of the avalanche breakdown of the gate-to-
channel pn-junction. When VGS ¼ 0, this occurs at VDS ¼ BVDS ¼ BVDG. Since VDG ¼ VDS VGS and
breakdown occurs when VDG ¼ BVDG, as VGS increases the breakdown voltage decreases, as given by BVDG ¼
BVDS  VGS. Thus, BVDS ¼ BVDG þ VGS. For example, if the gate-to-channel breakdown voltage is 50 V, the
VDS breakdown voltage will start off at 50 V when VGS ¼ 0 but decrease to 46 V when VGS ¼ 4 V.
In the nonsaturated region IDS is a function of both VGS and VDS, and in the lower portion of the
nonsaturated region where VDS is small compared to VP, IDS becomes an approximately linear function of VDS.
This linear portion of the nonsaturated is called the voltage-variable resistance (VVR) region, for in this region
the JFET acts like a linear resistance element between source and drain. The resistance is variable in that it is
controlled by the gate voltage. This region and VVR application will be discussed in a later section. The JFET
can also be operated in this region as a switch, and this will also be discussed in a later section.
JFET Biasing
Voltage Source Biasing
Now we will consider the biasing of JFETs for operation in the active region. The simplest biasing method is
shown in Figure 3.7, in which a voltage source VGG is used to provide the quiescent gate-to-source bias voltage
VGSQ. In the active region the transfer equation for the JFET has been given as IDS ¼ IDSS[1  (VGS/VP)]2, so

The voltage source method of biasing has several major drawbacks. Since VP will
have the opposite polarityof the drain supply voltage VDD, the gate bias voltagewill
require a second power supply. For the case of an n-channel JFET, VDD will come
from a positive supply voltage and VGG must come from a separate negative power
supply voltage or battery. A second, and perhaps more serious, problem is the
‘‘open-loop’’ nature of this biasing method. The JFET parameters of IDDS and VP
will exhibit very substantial unit-to-unit variations, often by as much as a 2:1
factor. There is also a signiﬁcant temperature dependence of IDDS and VP. These
variations will lead to major shifts in the position of the Q point and the resulting
distortion of the signal. A much better biasing method is shown in Figure 3.8.
Self-Biasing
The biasing circuit of Figure 3.8 is called a self-biasing circuit in that the gate-to-
source voltage is derived from the voltage drop produced by the ﬂow of drain
current through the source biasing resistor RS. It is a closed-loop system in that
variations in the JFET parameters can be partially compensated for by the
biasing circuit. The gate resistor RG is used to provide a dc return path for the
gate leakage current and is generally up in the megohm range.
The voltage drop across RS is given by VS ¼ IDS·RS. The voltage drop across
the gate resistor RG is VG ¼ IG·RG. Since IG is usually in the low nanoampere or
even picoampere range, as long as RG is not extremely large, the voltage drop
across RG can be neglected, so VG > 0. Thus, we have that VGS ¼ VG  VS >
VS ¼ IDS·RS. For example, if IDSS ¼ 10 mA and VP ¼ 4 V, and for a Q point
in the middle of the active region with IDSQ ¼ IDSS/2 ¼ 5 mA, we have that VGSQ
¼ 0.293VP ¼ 1.17 V. Therefore, the required value for the source biasing resistor is given by RS ¼ VGS/IDSQ
¼ 1.17 V/5 mA ¼ 234 O. This produces a more stable quiescent point than voltage source biasing, and no
separate negative power supply is required.
The closed-loop nature of this biasing circuit can be seen by noting that if changes in the JFET
parameters were to cause IDS to increase, the voltage drop across RS would also increase. This will produce an
increase in VGS (in the negative direction for an n-channel JFET), which will act to reduce the increase in IDS.
Thus, the net increase in IDS will be less due to the feedback voltage drop produced by the ﬂow of IDS through
RS. The same basic action would, of course, occur for changes in the JFET parameters that would cause IDS to
decrease.
Bias Stability
Now let us examine the stability of the Q point. We will start again with the basic transfer equation as given by
IDS ¼ IDSS[1  (VGS/VP)]2. From this equation the change in the drain current, DIDS, due to changes in IDSS,
VGS , and VP can be written as
DIDS ¼ gmDVGS  gm

Since VGS ¼ –IDS·RS, DVGS¼RS· DIDS, we obtain that

Now solving this for DIDS yields
DIDS ¼

From this we see that the shift in the quiescent drain current, DIDS, is reduced by the presence of RS by a factor
of 1 þ gmRS.

so 1 þ gm.S ¼ 1.83. Thus the sensitivity of IDS due to changes in VP and IDSS is reduced by a factor of 1.83.
The equation for DIDS can now be written in the following form for the fractional change in IDS:
DIDS
IDS
¼ 0:83ðDVP=VPÞ þ 1:41ðDIDSS=IDSSÞ
1:83
so DIDS/IDS ¼ 0.45 (DVP/VP) þ 0.77 (DIDSS/IDSS), and thus a 10% change in VP will result in approximately
a 4.5% change in IDS, and a 10% change in IDSS will result in an 8% change in IDS. Thus, although the situation
is improved with the self-biasing circuit using RS, there will still be a substantial variation in the quiescent
current with changes in the JFET parameters.
A further improvement in bias stability can be obtained by the use of the biasing methods of Figure 3.9 and
Figure 3.10. In Figure 3.9 a gate bias voltage VGG is obtained from the VDD supply voltage by means of the
RG1RG2 voltage divider. The gate-to-source voltage is now VGS ¼ VG  VS ¼ VGG  IDSRS. So now for RS we
have RS ¼ (VGG  VGS)/IDS. Since VGS is of opposite polarity to VGG, this will result in a larger value for RS
than before. This in turn will result in a larger value for the gmRS product and hence improved bias stability. If
we continue with the preceding examples and now let VGG ¼ VDD/2 ¼ þ10 V, we have that RS ¼ (VGG 
VGS)/IDS ¼ [þ10V(1.17V)]/5 mA ¼ 2.234 kO, as compared to RS ¼ 234 O that was obtained before. For
gm we have gm ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
IDS ·IDSS
p
=ðVPÞ ¼ 3:54 mS, so gmRS ¼ 3.54 mS·2.234 kO ¼ 7.90. Since 1 þ gmRS ¼ 8.90,
we now have an improvement by a factor of 8.9 over the open-loop voltage source biasing and by a factor of
4.9 over the self-biasing method without the VGG biasing of the gate.
Another biasing method that can lead to similar results is the method shown in Figure 3.10. In this
method the bottom end of the source biasing resistor goes to a negative supply voltage VSS instead of to
ground. The gate-to-source bias voltage is now given by VGS ¼ VG VS ¼ 0  (IDS · RS þ VSS) so that for
RS we now have RS ¼ (VGS  VSS)/IDS. If VSS ¼ 10 V, and as before IDS ¼ 5 mA and VGS ¼ 1.17 V,
we have RS ¼ 11.7 V/5 mA ¼ 2.34 kO, and thus gmRS ¼ 7.9 as in the preceding example. So this method
does indeed lead to results similar to that for the RS and VGG combination biasing. With either of these
two methods the change in IDS due to a 10% change in VP will be only 0.9%, and the change in IDS due to
a 10% change in IDSS will be only 1.6%.

The biasing circuits under consideration here can be applied directly to the common-source (CS) ampliﬁer
conﬁguration, and can also be used for the common-drain (CD), or source-follower, and common-gate (CG)
JFET conﬁgurations.
Transfer Characteristics
Transfer Equation
Now we will consider the transfer characteristics of the JFET, which is a graph of the output current IDS vs. the
input voltage VGS in the active region. In Figure 3.11 a transfer characteristic curve for a JFET with VP ¼ 4 V
and IDSS ¼ þ10 mA is given. This is approximately a square-law
relationship as given by IDS ¼ IDSS [1  (VGS/VP)]2. This equation is not
valid for VGS beyond VP (i.e., VGS , VP), for in this region the channel
is pinched off and IDS > 0.
At VGS ¼ 0, IDS ¼ IDSS. This equation and the corresponding transfer
curve can actually be extended up to the point where VGS > þ0:5 V. In
the region where 0 , VGS , þ0:5 V, the gate-to-channel pn-junction is
forward-biased and the depletion region width is reduced below the
width under zero bias conditions. This reduction in the depletion
region width leads to a corresponding expansion of the conducting
channel and thus an increase in IDS above IDSS. As long as the gate-to-
channel forward bias voltage is less than about 0.5 V, the pn-junction
will be essentially ‘‘off’’ and very little gate current will ﬂow. If VGS is increased much above þ0.5 V, however,
the gate-to-channel pn-junction will turn ‘‘on’’ and there will be a substantial ﬂow of gate voltage IG. This gate
current will load down the signal source and produce a voltage drop across the signal source resistance, as
shown in Figure 3.12. This voltage drop can cause VGS to be much smaller than the signal source voltage Vin.
As Vin increases, VGS will ultimately level off at a forward bias voltage of about þ0.7 V, and the signal source
will lose control over VGS, and hence over IDS. This can result in severe distortion of the input signal in the
form of clipping, and thus this situation should be avoided. Thus, although it is possible to increase IDS above
IDSS by allowing the gate-to-channel junction to become forward-biased by a small amount (<0.5 V), the
possible beneﬁts are generally far outweighed by the risk of signal distortion. Therefore, JFETs are almost
always operated with the gate-to-channel pn-junction reverse-biased.
Transfer Conductance
The slope of the transfer curve, dIDS/dVGS, is the dynamic forward transfer conductance, or mutual transfer
conductance, gm. We see that gm starts off at zero when VGS ¼ VP and increases as IDS increases, reaching a
maximum when IDS ¼ IDSS. Since IDS ¼ IDSS[1(VGS/VP)]2, gm can be obtained as
gm ¼ dIDS

The maximum value of gm is obtained when VGS ¼ 0 (IDS ¼ IDSS) and is given by gm (VGS ¼ 0) ¼ gm0

Small-Signal AC Voltage Gain
Let us consider the CS ampliﬁer circuit of Figure 3.13. The input
ac signal is applied between gate and source, and the output ac
voltage is taken between drain and source. Thus, the source
electrode of this triode device is common to input and output,
hence the designation of this JFET conﬁguration as a CS
ampliﬁer.
A good choice of the dc operating point or quiescent point (Q
point) for an ampliﬁer is in the middle of the active region at
IDS ¼ IDSS/2. This allows for the maximum symmetrical drain
current swing, from the quiescent level of IDSQ ¼ IDSS/2, down
to a minimum of IDS > 0, and up to a maximum of IDS ¼ IDSS.
This choice for the Q point is also a good one from the
standpoint of allowing for an adequate safety margin for the location of the actual Q point due to the
inevitable variations in device and component characteristics and values. This safety margin should keep the Q
point well away from the extreme limits of the active region, and thus ensure operation of the JFET in the
active region under most conditions. If IDSS ¼ þ10 mA, then a good choice for the Q point would thus be
around þ5.0 mA. If VP ¼ 4 V, then:

If a small ac signal voltage vGS is superimposed on the dc gate bias voltage VGS, only a small segment of the
transfer characteristic adjacent to the Q point will be traversed, as shown in Figure 3.14. This small segment
will be close to a straight line, and as a result the ac drain current ids will have a waveform close to that of the ac
voltage applied to the gate. The ratio of ids to vGS will be the slope of the transfer curve as given by
ids=vGS > dIDS=dVGS ¼ gm. Thus, ids > gmvGS. If the net load
driven by the drain of the JFET is the drain load resistor RD, as
shown in Figure 3.13, then the ac drain current ids will produce an
ac drain voltage of vds ¼ ids·RD. Since ids ¼ gmvGS, this becomes
vds ¼ gmvGS·RD. The ac small-signal voltage gain from gate to
drain thus becomes AV ¼ vO/vin ¼ vds/vGS ¼ gm·RD. The negative
sign indicates signal inversion as is the case for a CS ampliﬁer.
If the dc drain supply voltage is VDD ¼ þ20 V, a quiescent
drain-to-source voltage of VDSQ ¼ VDD/2 ¼ þ10 V will result in
the JFET being biased in the middle of the active region. Since
IDSQ ¼ þ5 mA in the example under consideration, the voltage
FIGURE 3.13

3-8
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

drop across the drain load resistor RD is 10 V. Thus, RD ¼ 10 V/5 mA ¼ 2 kO. The ac small-signal voltage
gain AV thus becomes AV ¼ gm· RD ¼ 3.54 mS· 2 kO ¼ 7.07. Note that the voltage gain is relatively
modest as compared to the much larger voltage gains that can be obtained in a bipolar-junction transistor
(BJT) common-emitter ampliﬁer. This is due to the lower transfer conductance of both JFETs and MOSFETs
(metal-oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistors) as compared to BJTs. For a BJT the transfer conductance
is given by gm ¼ IC/VT, where IC is the quiescent collector current and VT ¼ kT/q > 25 mV is the thermal
voltage. At IC ¼ 5 mA, gm ¼ 5 mA/25 mV ¼ 200 mS, as compared to only 3.5 mS for the JFET in this
example. With a net load of 2 kO, the BJT voltage gain will be 400 as compared to the JFET voltage gain of
only 7.1. Thus, FETs do have the disadvantage of a much lower transfer conductance, and therefore voltage
gain, than BJTs operating under similar quiescent current levels, but they do have the major advantage of a
much higher input impedance and a much lower input current. In the case of a JFET the input signal is
applied to the reverse-biased gate-to-channel pn-junction and thus sees a very high impedance. In the case of
a common-emitter BJT ampliﬁer, the input signal is applied to the forward-biased base-emitter junction, and
the input impedance is given approximately by rin ¼ rBE > 1.5 · b· VT/IC. If IC ¼ 5 mA and b ¼ 200, for
example, then rin > 1500 O. This moderate input resistance value of 1.5 kO is certainly no problem if the
signal source resistance is less than around 100 O. However, if the source resistance is above 1 kO, then there
will be a substantial signal loss in the coupling of the signal from the signal source to the base of the transistor.
If the source resistance is in the range of above 100 kO, and certainly if it is above 1 MO, then there will be
severe signal attenuation due to the BJT input impedance, and the FET ampliﬁer will probably offer a greater
overall voltage gain. Indeed, when high-impedance signal sources are encountered, a multistage ampliﬁer with
an FET input stage followed by cascaded BJT stages is often used.
JFET Output Resistance
Dynamic Drain-to-Source Conductance
For the JFET in the active region, the drain current IDS is a strong function of the gate-to-source voltage VGS
but is relatively independent of the drain-to-source voltage VDS. The transfer equation has previously been
stated as IDS ¼ IDSS [1(VGS/VP)]2.
The drain current will, however, increase slowly with increasing VDS. To take this dependence of IDS on VDS
into account, the transfer equation can be modiﬁed to give
IDS ¼ IDSS 1  VGS
VP

2
1 þ VDS
VA


where VA is a constant called the early voltage and is a parameter of the transistor with units of volts. The early
voltage VA is generally in the range of 30 to 300 V for most JFETs. The variation of the drain current with
drain voltage is the result of the channel-length modulation effect in which the channel length decreases as the
drain voltage increases. This decrease in the channel length results in an increase in the drain current. In BJTs
a similar effect is the base-width modulation effect.
The dynamic drain-to-source conductance is deﬁned as gds¼dIDS/dVDS and can be obtained from the
modiﬁed transfer equation IDS ¼ IDSS [1(VGS/VP)]2 [1þVDS/VA] as simply gds ¼ IDS/VA. The reciprocal of gds
is dynamic drain-to-source resistance rds, so rds ¼ 1/gds ¼ VA/IDS. If, for example, VA¼100 V, we have that rds ¼
100 V/IDS. At IDS ¼ 1 mA, rds ¼ 100 V/1 mA ¼ 100 kO, and at IDS ¼ 10 mA, rds ¼ 10 kO.
Equivalent Circuit Model of CS Ampliﬁer Stage
A small-signal equivalent circuit model of a CS FETampliﬁer stage is shown in Figure 3.15. The ac small-signal
voltage gain is given by AV ¼  gm·Rnet, where Rnet ¼ [rdsk RDk RL] is the net load driven by the drain for the
FET and includes the dynamic drain-to-source resistance rds. Since rds is generally much larger than [RDk RL],
it will usually be the case that Rnet > [RDk RL], and rds can be neglected. There are, however, some cases in
which rds must be taken into account. This is especially true for the case in which an active load is used, as
shown in Figure 3.16. For this case Rnet ¼ [rds1k rds2k RL], and rds can be a limiting factor in determining the
voltage gain.

Consider an example for the active load circuit of Figure 3.16 for the case of identical JFETs with the same
quiescent current. Assume that RL .. rds so that Rnet > [rds1k rds2] ¼ VA/(2IDSQ). Let IDSQ ¼ IDSS/2, so

If VA ¼ 100 V and VP ¼ 2 V, we obtain AV ¼ 70, so we see that with active loads relatively large voltage
gains can be obtained with FETs.
Another circuit in which the dynamic drain-to-source resistance rds is important is the constant-current
source or current regulator diode. In this case the current regulation is directly proportional to the dynamic
drain-to-source resistance.
Source Follower
Source-Follower Voltage Gain
We will now consider the CD JFET conﬁguration, which is also known as the source follower. A basic CD
circuit is shown in Figure 3.17. The input signal is supplied to the gate of the JFET. The output is taken from
the source of the JFET, and the drain is connected directly to the VDD supply voltage, which is ac ground.
For the JFET in the active region we have that ids ¼ gmvGS. For this CD circuit we also have that vGS ¼ vGvS
and vS ¼ idsRnet, where Rnet ¼ [RSk RL] is the net load resistance driven by the transistor. Since vGS ¼ ids/gm,
we have that ids/gm ¼ vGidsRnet. Collecting terms in ids on the left side yields ids [(1/gm) þ Rnet] ¼ vG, so:

Upon dividing through by gm this can be rewritten as
AV ¼

ð1=gmÞ þ Rnet
From this we see that the voltage gain will be positive, and thus the source follower is a noninverting ampliﬁer.
We also note that AV will always be less than unity, although for the usual case of Rnet .. 1/gm, the voltage
gain will be close to unity.
The source follower can be represented as an ampliﬁer with an open-circuit (i.e., no load) voltage
transfer ratio of unity and an output resistance of rO ¼ 1/gm. The equation for AV can be expressed as AV
¼ Rnet/(Rnet þ rO), which is the voltage division ratio of the rO ¼ Rnet circuit.
Source-Follower Examples
Let us consider an example of a JFET with IDSS ¼ 10 mA and VP ¼ 4 V. Let VDD ¼ þ20 V and IDSQ ¼
IDSS/2 ¼ 5 mA. For IDS ¼ IDSS/2 the value of VGS is 1.17 V. To bias the JFET in the middle of the active
region, we will let VGQ ¼ VDD/2 ¼ þ10 V, so VSQ ¼ VGQVGS ¼ þ10 V(1.17 V) ¼ þ11.17 V. Thus
RS ¼ VSQ/IDSQ ¼ 11.17 V/5 mA ¼ 2.23 kO.
The transfer conductance at IDS ¼ 5 mA is 3.54 mS so that rO ¼ 1/gm ¼ 283 O. Since gmRS ¼ 7.9, good bias
stability will be obtained. If RL .. RS, then AV > RS/(rO þ RS) ¼ 2.23 kO/(283 O þ 2.23 kO) ¼ 0.887.
If RL ¼ 1 kO, then Rnet ¼ 690 O, and AV drops to 0.709, and if RL ¼ 300 O, Rnet ¼ 264 O and AV is down to
0.483. A BJT emitter-follower circuit has the same equations for the voltage gain as the FET source follower.
For the BJT case, rO ¼ 1/gm ¼ VT/IC, where VT ¼ thermal voltage ¼ kT/q > 25 mV and IC is the quiescent
collector current. For IC ¼ 5 mA, we get rO > 25 mV/5 mA ¼ 5O as compared to rO ¼ 283 O for the JFET
case at the same quiescent current level. So the emitter follower does have a major advantage over the source
follower since it has a much lower output resistance rO and can thus drive very small load resistances with a
voltage gain close to unity. For example, with RL ¼ 100 O, we get AV > 0.26 for the source follower as
compared to AV > 0.95 for the emitter follower.
The FET source follower does, however, offer substantial advantages over the emitter follower of a much
higher input resistance and a much lower input current. For the case in which a very high-impedance source,
up in the megohm range, is to be coupled to a low-impedance load down in the range of 100 O or less, a good
combination to consider is that of a cascaded FET source follower followed by a BJT emitter follower. This
combination offers the very high input resistance of the source follower and the very low output resistance of
the emitter follower.
For the source-follower circuit under consideration the input resistance will be Rin ¼ [RG1k RG2] ¼ 10 MO.
If the JFET gate current is speciﬁed as 1 nA (max), and for good bias stability the change in gate voltage due to
the gate current should not exceed jVPj/10 ¼ 0.4 V, the maximum allowable value for [RG1k RG2] is given by
IG·[RG1k RG2],0.4 V. Thus [RG1k RG2],0.4 V/1 nA ¼ 0.4 GO ¼ 400 MO. Therefore, RG1 and RG2 can each
be allowed to be as large as 800 MO, and very large values for Rin can thus be obtained. At higher frequencies
the input capacitance Cin must be considered, and Cin will ultimately limit the input impedance of the circuit.
Since the input capacitance of the FET will be comparable to that of the BJT, the advantage of the FET source

follower over the BJT emitter follower from the standpoint of input impedance will be obtained only at
relatively low frequencies.
Source-Follower Frequency Response
The input capacitance of the source follower is given by Cin ¼ CGD þ (1AV) CGS. Since AV is close to unity,
Cin will be approximately given by Cin > CGD. The source-follower input capacitance can, however, be reduced
below CGD by a bootstrapping circuit in which the drain voltage is made to follow the gate voltage. Let us
consider a representative example in which CGD ¼ 5 pF, and let the signal-source output resistance be
R1 ¼ 100 kO. The input circuit is in the form of a simple RC low-pass network. The RC time constant is
t ¼ ½RkRG1kRG2	 · Cin > R1 · CGD
Thus t > 100 kO·5 pF ¼ 500 nsec ¼ 0.5 msec. The corresponding 3-dB or half-power frequency is
fH ¼ 1/(2 pt) ¼ 318 kHz. If R1¼1 MO, the 3-dB frequency will be down to about 30 kHz. Thus, we
see indeed the limitation on the frequency response that is due to the input capacitance.
Frequency and Time-Domain Response
Small-Signal CS Model for High-Frequency Response
We will now consider the frequency- and time-domain
response of the JFET CS ampliﬁer. In Figure 3.18 an ac
representation of a CS ampliﬁer is shown, the dc biasing
not being shown. In Figure 3.19 the JFET small-signal ac
equivalent
circuit
model
is
shown,
including
the
junction capacitances CGS and CGD. The gate-to-drain
capacitance CGD is a feedback capacitance in that it is
connected between output (drain) and input (gate).
Using Miller’s theorem for shunt feedback this feedback
capacitance can be transformed into an equivalent input
capacitance CGD0 ¼ (1AV)CGD and an equivalent out-
put capacitance CGD0 0 ¼ (11/AV)CGD, as shown in
Figure 3.20. The net input capacitance is now Cin ¼ CGS
þ (1AV)CGD and the net output capacitance is
CO ¼ (1 1/AV)CGD þ CL. Since the voltage gain AV
is given by AV ¼ gmRnet, where Rnet represents the net
load resistance, the equations for Cin and CO can be
written approximately as Cin ¼ CGS þ (1 þ gmRnet)CGD
and CO ¼ [1 þ 1/(gmRnet)]CGD þ CL. Since usually
AV ¼ gmRnet .. 1, CO can be written as CO > CGD þ
CL. Note that the voltage gain given by AV ¼ gmRnet
is not valid in the higher frequency, where AV will
decrease
with
increasing
frequency.
Therefore
the
expressions for Cin and CO will not be exact but will
still be a useful approximation for the determination of
the frequency- and time-domain responses. We also note
that the contribution of CGD to the input capacitance is
increased by the Miller effect factor of 1þ gmRnet.
The circuit in Figure 3.21 is in the form of two
cascaded RC low-pass networks. The RC time constant
on the input side is t1 ¼ [R1k RG]· Cin > R1· Cin,
where R1 is the signal-source resistance. The RC time

constant on the output side is given by t2 ¼ Rnet· CO. The
corresponding breakpoint frequencies are
f1 ¼
1
2pt1
¼
1
2pR1·Cin
and
f2 ¼
1
2pt2
¼
1
2pRnet·Co
The 3-dB or half-power frequency of this ampliﬁer stage will be a function of f1 and f2. If these two breakpoint
frequencies are separated by at least a decade (i.e., 10:1 ratio), the 3-dB frequency will be approximately equal
to the lower of the two breakpoint frequencies. If the breakpoint frequencies are not well separated, then the
3-dB frequency can be obtained from the following approximate relationship: (1/f3dB)2 > (1/f1)2 þ (1/f2)2.
The time-domain response as expressed in terms of the 10 to 90% rise time is related to the frequency-domain
response by the approximate relationship that trise > 0.35/f3dB.
We will now consider a representative example. We will let CGS ¼ 10 pF and CGD ¼ 5 pF. We will assume
that the net load driven by the drain of the transistors is Rnet ¼ 2 kO and CL ¼ 10 pF. The signal-source
resistance R1 ¼ 100 O. The JFET will have IDSS ¼ 10 mA, IDSQ ¼ IDSS/2 ¼ 5 mA, and VP ¼ 4 V, so
gm ¼ 3.535 mS. Thus the midfrequency gain is AV ¼  gmRnet ¼ 3.535 mS· 2 kO ¼ 7.07. Therefore, we
have that:
Cin > CGS þ ð1 þ gmRnetÞCGD ¼ 10 pF þ 8:07:5 pF
and
Co > CGD þ CL ¼ 15 pF
Thus, t1 ¼ R1· Cin ¼ 100 O · 50.4 pF ¼ 5040 ps ¼ 5.04 nsec, and t2 ¼ Rnet· CO ¼ 2 kO · 15 pF ¼ 30 nsec.
The corresponding breakpoint frequencies are f1 ¼ 1/(2p · 5.04 nsec) ¼ 31.6 MHz and f 2 ¼ 1/(2p · 30 ns)
¼ 5.3 MHz. The 3-dB frequency of the ampliﬁer can be obtained from (1/f 3dB)2 > (1/f 1)2 þ
(1/f 2)2 ¼ (1/31.6 MHz)2þ (1/5.3 MHz)2, which gives f 3dB > 5.2 MHz. The 10 to 90% rise time can be
obtained from trise > 0.35/f 3dB ¼ 0.35/5.2 MHz ¼ 67 nsec.
In the preceding example the dominant time constant is the output circuit time constant of t2 ¼ 30 nsec due
to the combination of load resistance and output capacitance. If we now consider a signal-source resistance of
1 kO, the input circuit time constant will be t1 ¼ R1·Cin ¼ 1000 O ·50.4 pF ¼ 50.4 nsec. The corresponding
breakpoint frequencies are f 1 ¼ 1/(2p · 50.4 nsec) ¼ 3.16 MHz and f 2 ¼ 1/(2p · 30 nsec) ¼ 5.3 MHz. The
3-dB frequency is now f 3dB > 2.7 MHz, and the rise time is trise > 129 nsec. If R1 is further increased to 10 kO,
we obtain t1 ¼ R1· Cin ¼ 10 kO ·50.4 pF ¼ 504 nsec, giving breakpoint frequencies of f 1 ¼ 1/(2p· 504
nsec) ¼ 316 kHz and f 2 ¼ 1/(2p · 30 nsec) ¼ 5.3 MHz. Now t1 is clearly the dominant time constant, the
3-dB frequency is now down to f 3dB > f 1 ¼ 316 kHz, and the rise time is up to trise > 1.1 msec. Finally, for the
case of R1 ¼ 1 MO, the 3-dB frequency will be only 3.16 kHz and the rise time will be 111 msec.
Use of Source Follower for Impedance Transformation
We see that large values of signal-source resistance can seriously limit the ampliﬁer bandwidth and increase the
rise time. In these cases, the use of an impedance transforming circuit such as an FET source follower or a BJT
emitter follower can be very useful. Let us consider the use of a source follower as shown in Figure 3.22. We will
assume that both FETs are identical to the one in the preceding examples and are biased at IDSQ ¼ 5 mA. The
source follower Q1 will have an input capacitance of Cin ¼ CGD þ (1AV1) CGS > CGD ¼ 5 pF, since AV will be
FIGURE 3.21
3-13
Transistors

very close to unity for a source follower that is driving a CS ampliﬁer.
The source-follower output resistance will be rO ¼ 1/gm ¼ 1/3.535
mS ¼ 283 O. Let us again consider the case of R1 ¼ 1 MO. The time
constant due to the combination of R1 and the input capacitance of
the source follower is tSF ¼ 1 MO ·5 pf ¼ 5 msec. The time constant
due to the combination of the source-follower output resistance rO
and the input capacitance of the CS stage is t1 ¼ rO·Cin ¼ 283 O·50.4
pF ¼ 14 nsec, and the time constant of the output circuit is
t2 ¼ 30 nsec, as before. The breakpoint frequencies are f SF ¼ 31.8 -
kHz, f 1 ¼ 11 MHz, and f 2 ¼ 5.3 MHz. The 3-dB frequency of the
system is now f 3dB > f SF ¼ 31.8 kHz, and the rise time is trise > 11
msec. The use of the source follower thus results in an improvement by
a factor of 10:1 over the preceding circuit.
Voltage-Variable Resistor
Operation of a JFET as a Voltage-Variable Resistor
We will now consider the operation of a JFET as a voltage-variable
resistor (VVR). A JFET can be used as a VVR in which the drain-to-
source resistance rds of the JFET can be varied by variation of VGS.
For values of VDS,,VP the IDS vs. VDS characteristics are approxi-
mately linear, so the JFET looks like a resistor, the resistance value of
which can be varied by the gate voltage as shown in Figure 3.23.
The channel conductance in the region where VDS,,VP is given
by gds ¼ As/L ¼ WHs/L, where the channel height H is given by
H ¼ H02WD. In this equation, WD is the depletion region width
and H0 is the value of H as WD ! 0. The depletion region width is
given by, WD ¼ K ﬃﬃﬃ

As VGS ! 0, rds ! rds (on), and as VGS ! VP, rds ! 1. This latter condition corresponds to the channel being
pinched off in its entirety all the way from source to drain. This is like having a big block of insulator (i.e., the
depletion region) between source and drain. When VGS ¼ 0, rds is reduced to its minimum value of rds (on),
which for most JFETs is in the 20- to 400-O range. At the other extreme, when VGS.VP, the drain-to-source
current IDS is reduced to a very small value, generally down into the low nanoampere or even picoampere
range. The corresponding value of rds is not really inﬁnite but is very large, generally well up into the gigaohm
(1000 MO) range. Thus by variation of VGS, the drain-to-source resistance can be varied over a very wide
range. As long as the gate-to-channel junction is reverse-biased, the gate current will be very small, generally
down in the low nanoampere or even picoampere range, so the gate as a control electrode draws very little
current. Since VP is generally in the 2- to 5-V range for most JFETs, the VDS values required to operate the
JFET in the VVR range are generally ,0.1 V. In Figure 3.23 the VVR region of the JFET IDS vs. VDS
characteristics is shown.
VVR Applications
Applications of VVRs include automatic gain control (AGC) circuits, electronic attenuators, electronically
variable ﬁlters, and oscillator amplitude control circuits.
When using a JFET as a VVR, it is necessary to limit VDS to values that are small compared to VP to
maintain good linearity. In addition, VGS should preferably not exceed 0.8 VP for good linearity, control, and
stability. This limitation corresponds to an rds resistance ratio of about 10:1. As VGS approaches VP, a small
change in VP can produce a large change in rds. Thus unit-to-unit variations in VP as well as changes in VP
with temperature can result in large changes in rds as VGS approaches VP.
The drain-to-source resistance rds will have a temperature coefﬁcient (TC) due to two causes: (1) the
variation of the channel resistivity with temperature and (2) the temperature variation of VP. The TC of the
channel resistivity is positive, whereas the TC of VP is negative due to the negative TC of the contact potential
f. The positive TC of the channel resistivity will contribute to a positive TC of rds. The negative TC of VP will
contribute to a negative TC of rds. At small values of VGS, the dominant contribution to the TC is the positive
TC of the channel resistivity, so rds will have a positive TC. As VGS gets larger, the negative TC contribution of
VP becomes increasingly important, and there will be a value of VGS at which the net TC of rds is zero, and
above this value of VGS the TC will be negative. The TC of rds(on) is typically þ0.3%/–C for n-channel
JFETs and þ0.7%/–C for p-channel JFETs. For example, for a typical JFET with an rds (on) ¼ 500 O at 25–C
and VP ¼ 2.6 V, the zero TC point will occur at VGS ¼ 2.0 V.
Any JFET can be used as a VVR, although there are JFETs that are
speciﬁcally made for this application.
A simple example of a VVR application is the electronic gain
control circuit of Figure 3.24. The voltage gain is given by
AV ¼ 1þ(RF/rds). If, for example, RF ¼ 19 kO and rds(on) ¼ 1
kO, then the maximum gain will be AVmax ¼ 1 þ [RF/rds (on)]
¼ 20. As VGS approaches VP, rds will increase and become very
large such that rds .. RF, so that AV will decrease to a minimum

value of close to unity. Thus, the gain can be varied over a 20:1 ratio. Note that VDS > Vin, so to minimize
distortion the input signal amplitude should be small compared to VP.
Deﬁning Terms
Active region:
The region of JFET operation in which the channel is pinched off at the drain end but still
open at the source end such that the drain-to-source current IDS approximately saturates. The condition
for this is that jVGSj,j VPj and j VDSj.j VPj. The active region is also known as the saturated region.
Ohmic, nonsaturated, or triode region:
The three terms all refer to the region of JFET operation in
which a conducting channel exists all the way between source and drain. In this region the drain current
varies with both VGS and VDS.
Drain saturation current, IDSS:
The drain-to-source current ﬂow through the JFET under the conditions
that VGS ¼ 0 and j VDSj.j VPj such that the JFET is operating in the active or saturated region.
Pinch-off voltage, VP:
The voltage that when applied across the gate-to-channel pn-junction will cause the
conducting channel between drain and source to become pinched off. This is also represented as VGS
(off).

3.2
Bipolar Transistors
Joseph Watson
Modern ampliﬁers abound in the form of integrated circuits (ICs), which contain transistors, diodes, and other
structures diffused into single-crystal dice. As an introduction to these ICs, it is convenient to examine single-
transistor ampliﬁers, which in fact are also widely used in their own right as discrete circuits—and indeed
much more complicated discrete signal-conditioning circuits are frequently found following sensors of various
sorts.
There are two basic forms of transistor, the bipolar family and the ﬁeld-effect family, and both appear in ICs.
They differ in their modes of operation but may be incorporated into circuits in quite similar ways. To
understand elementary circuits, there is no need to become too familiar with the physics of transistors, but
some basic facts about their electrical properties must be known.
Consider the bipolar transistor, of which there are two types, npn and pnp. Electrically, they differ only in
terms of current direction and voltage polarity. Figure 3.25(a) illustrates the idealized structure of an npn
transistor, and diagram (b) implies that it corresponds to a pair of diodes with three leads. This representation
does not convey sufﬁcient information about the actual operation of the transistor, but it does make the point
that the ﬂow of conventional current (positive to negative) is easy from the base to the emitter, since it passes
through a forward-biased diode, but difﬁcult from the collector to the base, because ﬂow is prevented by a
reverse-biased diode.
Figure 3.25(c) gives the standard symbol for the npn transistor, and diagram (d) deﬁnes the direction of
current ﬂow and the voltage polarities observed when the device is in operation. Finally, diagram (e) shows
that for the pnp transistor, all these directions are reversed and the polarities are inverted.

For a transistor, there is a main current ﬂow between the collector and the emitter, and a very much smaller
current ﬂow between the base and the emitter. So, the following relations may be written:
IE ¼ IC þ IB
ð3:1Þ
(Note that the arrow on the transistor symbol deﬁnes the emitter and the direction of current ﬂow—out for
the npn device, and in for the pnp.) Also
IC=IB ¼ hFE
ð3:2Þ
Here, hFE is called the dc common-emitter current gain, and because IC.. IB then hFE is large, typically 50 to
300. The implication of this may be seen immediately: if the small current IB can be used to control the large
current IC, then the transistor may obviously be used as a current ampliﬁer. (This is why Figure 3.25(b) is
inadequate—it completely neglects this all-important current-gain property of the transistor.) Furthermore, if
a load resistance is connected into the collector circuit, it will become a voltage ampliﬁer as well.
Unfortunately, hFE is an ill-deﬁned quantity and varies not only from transistor to transistor, but also
changes with temperature. The relationship between the base-emitter voltage VBE and the collector current is
much better deﬁned and closely follows an exponential law over at least eight decades. This relationship is
shown in both linear and logarithmic form in Figure 3.26. Because the output current IC is dependent upon
the input voltage VBE, the plot must be a transfer conductance or transconductance characteristic. The relevant
law is

Transistors

Here, IES is an extremely small leakage current internal to the transistor, q is the electronic charge, k is
Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. Usually, kT/q is called VT and is about
26 mV at a room temperature of 25–C. This implies that for any value of VBE over about 100 mV, then
expðVBE=VTÞ q 1; and for all normal operating conditions, Equation (3.3) reduces to
IC ¼ IESeVBE=VT
for VBE > 100 mV
ð3:4Þ
The term ‘‘normal operating conditions’’ is easily interpreted from Figure 3.26(a), which shows that when VBE
has reached about 0.6 to 0.7 V, any small ﬂuctuations in its value cause major ﬂuctuations in IC. This situation
is illustrated by the dashed lines enclosing DVBE and DIC, and it implies that to use the transistor as an
ampliﬁer, working values of VBE and IC must be established, after which signals may be regarded as
ﬂuctuations around these values.
Under these quiescent, operating, or working conditions:
IC ¼ IQ
and
VCE ¼ VQ
and methods of deﬁning these quiescent or operating conditions are called biasing.
Biasing the Bipolar Transistor
A fairly obvious way to bias the transistor is to ﬁrst establish a constant voltage VB using a potential divider R1
and R2 as shown in the biasing circuit of Figure 3.27. Here:
VB . VCCR2
R1 þ R2
if IB is very small compared with the current through R2, which is usual. If it is not, this fact must be taken
into account.
This voltage will be much greater than VBE if a realistic power supply is used along with realistic values of R1
and R2. Hence, when the transistor is connected into the circuit, an emitter resistor must also be included so
that:
VBE ¼ VB  IERE
ð3:5Þ
Now consider what happens when the power supply is connected. As VB appears, a current IB ﬂows into the
base and produces a much larger current IC ¼ hFEIB in the collector. These currents add in the emitter to give
FIGURE 3.27
A transistor biasing circuit.
3-18
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

IE ¼ IB þ hFEIB ¼ ð1 þ hFEÞIB . hFEIB
ð3:6Þ
Clearly, IE will build up until a ﬁxed or quiescent value of base-emitter voltage VBEQ appears. Should IE try to
build up further, VBE will fall according to Equation (3.5) and, hence, so will IE. Conversely, should IE not
build up enough, VBE will increase until it does so.
This is actually a case of current-derived negative feedback, and it successfully holds the collector current
near the quiescent value IQ. Furthermore, it does so despite different transistors with different values of hFE
being used and despite temperature variations. Actually, VBE itself falls with temperature at about –2.2 mV/–C
for constant IC, and the circuit will also compensate for this. The degree of success of the negative feedback in
holding IQ constant is called the bias stability.
This is one example of a common-emitter (CE) circuit, so-called because the emitter is the common
terminal for both base and collector currents. The behavior of the transistor in such a circuit may be illustrated
by superimposing a load line on the output characteristics of the transistor, as shown in Figure 3.28.
If the collector current IC is plotted against the collector-to-emitter voltage VCE, a family of curves for
various ﬁxed values of VBE or IB results, as in Figure 3.28. These curves show that as VCE increases, IC rises very
rapidly and then turns over as it is limited by IB. In the CE circuit, if IB were reduced to zero, then IC would
also be zero (apart from a small leakage current ICE0). Hence there would be no voltage drop in either RC or
RE, and practically all of VCC would appear across the transistor. That is, under cut-off conditions:
VCE ! VCC
for IB ¼ 0
ð3:7Þ
Conversely, if IB were large, IC would be very large, almost all of VCC would be dropped across RCþRE and
IC !
VCC
RC þ RE
for large IB
ð3:8Þ
Actually, because the initial rise in IC for the transistor is not quite vertical, there is always a small saturation
voltage VCES across the transistor under these conditions, where VCES means the voltage across the transistor in
FIGURE 3.28
The load-line diagram.

Transistors

the common-emitter mode when saturated. In this saturated condition, VCES . 0:3 V for small silicon
transistors. Both these conditions are shown in Figure 3.28.
From the circuit of Figure 3.27:
VCE ¼ VCC  ICðRC þ REÞ
ð3:9aÞ
which may be rewritten as
IC ¼ VCE=ðRC þ REÞ þ VCC=ðRC þ REÞ
ð3:9bÞ
This is the straight-line equation to the dc load-line (compare y ¼ mxþc), showing that its slope is
–1/(RC þ RE) and that it crosses the IC axis at VCC/(RC þ RE) as expected. The actual position of a point
is determined by where this load line crosses the output characteristic in use, that is, by what value of VBE or IB
is chosen. For example, the quiescent point for the transistor is where the load line crosses the output curve
deﬁned by VBE ¼ VBEQ (or IB ¼ IBQ) to give VCE ¼ VQ and IC ¼ IQ.
Note that because the transistor is nonohmic (that is, it does not obey Ohm’s law), the voltage across it may
only be determined by using the (ohmic) voltage drop across the resistors RC and RE according to Equation
(3.9). At the quiescent point this is
VQ ¼ VCC  IQðRC þ REÞ
A design example will illustrate typical values involved with a small-transistor CE stage.
Example 1
A transistor is to be biased at a collector current of 1 mA when a 12-V power supply is applied. Using the
circuit of Figure 3.27, determine the values of R1, R2, and RE if 3.4 V is to be dropped across RE and if the
current through R2 is to be 10 IBQ. Assume that for the transistor used, VBEQ ¼ 0.6 V and hFE ¼ 100.
Solution. In this circuit IQ ¼ 1 mA . IE (because IB ,, lIC). Hence,
RE ¼ VRE
IQ

Also, VB ¼ VREþVBE ¼ 3.4þ0.6 ¼ 4 V. This gives:

this not been done, R1 would have worked out at 80 kO. Usually, this difference is not very important because
discrete (or individual) resistors are available only in a series of nominal values, and each of these is subject to a
tolerance, including 10, 5, 2, and 1%.

In the present case, the following (5%) values could reasonably be chosen:
RE ¼ 3:3 kO
R1 ¼ 75 kO
R2 ¼ 39 kO
All this means that IQ cannot be predetermined very accurately, but the circuit nevertheless settles down to a
value close to the chosen one, and, most importantly, stays there almost irrespective of the transistor used and
the ambient temperature encountered.
Having biased the transistor into an operating condition, it is possible to consider small-signal operation.
Small-Signal Operation
In the biasing circuit of Figure 3.27, the collector resistor RC had no discernible function because it is simply
the load resistor across which the signal output voltage is developed. However, it was included because it also
drops a voltage due to the bias current ﬂowing through it. This means that its value must not be so large that it
robs the transistor of adequate operating voltage; that is, it must not be responsible for moving the operating
point too far to the left in Figure 3.28.
If the chosen bias current and voltage are IQ and VQ, then small signals are actually only ﬂuctuations in
these bias (or average) values that can be separated from them using coupling capacitors.
To inject an input signal to the base, causing VBE and
IB to ﬂuctuate by vbe and ib, a signal source must be
connected between the base and the common or zero
line (also usually called ground or earth whether it is
actually connected to ground or not!). However, most
signal sources present a resistive path through them-
selves, which would shunt R2 and so change, or even
destroy, the bias conditions. Hence, a coupling capacitor
Cc must be included, as shown in Figure 3.29, in series
with
a
signal
source

equivalent.
The emitter resistor RE was included for biasing reasons (although there are other bias circuits that omit it),
but for signal ampliﬁcation purposes it must be shunted by a high-value capacitor CE so that the signal current
can ﬂow down to ground without producing a signal voltage drop leading to negative feedback (as did the bias
current). The value of CE must be much greater than is apparent at ﬁrst sight, and this point will be developed
later; for the present, it will be assumed that it is large enough to constitute a short circuit at all the signal
frequencies of interest. So, for ac signals RE is short-circuited and only RC acts as a load. This implies that a
signal or ac load line comes into operation with a slope of –1/RC, as shown in Figure 3.30.
The ways in which the small-signal quantities ﬂuctuate may now be examined. If vbe goes positive, this
actually means that VBE increases a little. This in turn implies that IC increases by an amount ic, so the voltage
drop in RC increases by vce. Keeping in mind that the top of RC is held at a constant voltage, this means that the
voltage at the bottom of RC must fall by vce. This very important point shows that because vce falls as vbe rises,
there is 180– phase shift through the stage. That is, the CE stage is an inverting voltage ampliﬁer. However,
because ic increases into the collector as ib increases into the base, it is also a noninverting current ampliﬁer.
Now consider the amount by which vce changes with vbe, which is the terminal voltage gain of the stage. In
Figure 3.26, the slope of the transconductance curve at any point deﬁnes by how much IC changes with a
ﬂuctuation in VBE. That is, it gives the ratio ic/vbe at any operating point Q. Equation (3.4) is
Ic ¼ IESeVBE=VT

so that

Now the signal output voltage is

(Here, the approximation sign is because the collector-emitter path within the transistor does present a large
resistance rce through which a very small part of ic ﬂows.)
The terminal voltage gain is therefore:
Av ¼ vce

where the negative sign implies signal inversion.
In practice, VT . 26 mV at room temperature, as has been mentioned, and this leads to a very simple

The magnitude and phase relationships between vce and ic can easily be seen by including them on the signal
load-line diagram as shown in Figure 3.30, where the output characteristics of the transistor have been omitted
for clarity. Sinusoidal output signals have been inserted, and either may be obtained from the other by
following the signal load-line locus.
Now consider the small-signal current gain. Because the value of hFE is not quite linear on the IC/IB graph,
its slope too must be used for small-signal work. However, the departure from linearity is not great over
normal working conditions, and the small-signal value hfe is usually quite close to that of hFE. Hence:
Ai ¼ ic

Three of the four main (midfrequency) parameters for the CE stage have now been derived, all from a rather
primitive understanding of the transistor itself. The fourth, Rout, is the dynamic, incremental, or small-signal
resistance of the transistor from collector to emitter, which is the slope of the output characteristic at the
working point rce. Being associated with a reverse-biased (CB) junction, this is high—typically about
0.5 MO—so that the transistor acts as a current source feeding a comparatively low load resistance RC.
Summarizing, at mid-frequency:
Ai . hfe
Av . gmRC
Rin . hfe

Rout . rce
Example 2
Using the biasing values for R1, R2, and RE already obtained in Example 1, calculate the value of RC to give a
terminal voltage gain of –150. Then determine the input resistance Rin if hfe for the transistor is 10% higher
than hFE.
Solution.
Because IQ ¼ 1 mA, gm . 39 · 1 ¼ 39 mA=V: Hence, Av . gmRC or  150 . 39 RC, giving
RC ¼ 150=39 . 3:9 kO
(Note: This value must be checked to determine that it is reasonable insofar as biasing is concerned. In this
case, it will drop IQRC ¼ 1–3.9 ¼ 3.9 V. Because VRE ¼ 3.4 V, this leaves 12 – 3.9 – 3.4 ¼ 4.7 V across the
transistor, which is reasonable.)
Finally:

A Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit
The conclusions reached above regarding the performance of the bipolar transistor are sufﬁcient for the
development of a basic equivalent circuit, or model, relevant only to small-signal operation. Taking the
operating CE ampliﬁer, this may be done by ﬁrst ‘‘looking into’’ the base, shown as b in Figure 3.31. Between
this point and the actual active part of the base region b0, it is reasonable to suppose that the intervening
3-23

(inactive) semiconductor material will present a small resistance rbb0. This is called the base spreading
resistance, and it is also shown in Figure 3.31.
From b0 to the emitter e, there will be a dynamic or incremental resistance given by
rb0e ¼ vb0e

ð3:14Þ
so that the full resistance from the base to the emitter must be
Rin ¼ rbb0 þ rb0e ¼ rbb0 þ hfe

. hfe
gm
ð3:15Þ
because rbb0 is only about 10 to 100 O, which is small compared with rb0e, this being several kilohms (as shown
by the last example). It will now be understood why Equation (3.13) gave Rin . hfe=gm.
The reverse-biased junction that exists from b0 to the collector ensures that the associated dynamic
resistance rb0c will be very large indeed, which is fortunate; otherwise, signal feedback from the output to the
input would modify the gain characteristics of the ampliﬁer. Typically, rb0c will be some tens of megohms.
However, because of transistor action, the dynamic resistance from collector to emitter, rce, will be smaller
than rb0c and will typically be below a megohm. This ‘‘transistor action’’ may be represented by a current
source from collector to emitter that is dependent upon either ib or vb0e. That is, it will be either hfeib or gmvb0e.
The latter leads to the well-known hybrid-p model, and it is this that is shown in Figure 3.31.
Where junctions or interfaces of any sort exist, there will always be distributed capacitances associated with
them; and to make these easy to handle analytically, they may be ‘‘lumped’’ into single capacitances. In the
present context, two lumped capacitances have been incorporated into the hybrid-p model, Cb0e from base to
emitter and Cb0c from base to collector, respectively. These now complete the model, and it will be appreciated
that they make it possible to analyze high-frequency performance. Typically, Cb0e will be a few picofarads and
will always be larger than Cb0c.
Figure 3.31 is the hybrid-p small-signal, dynamic, or incremental model for a bipolar transistor; and when
external components are added and simpliﬁcations made, it makes possible the determination of the
performance of an ampliﬁer using that transistor not only at midfrequencies but also at high and low
frequencies.
Low-Frequency Performance
In Figure 3.32 both a source and a load have been added to the hybrid-p equivalent circuit to model the
complete CE stage of Figure 3.29. Here, both Cb0e and Cb0c have been omitted because they are too small to
FIGURE 3.31

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

affect the low-frequency performance, as has rb0c because it is large and so neither loads the source signiﬁcantly
compared to rbb0þrb0e nor applies much feedback.
The signal source has been represented by a The´venin equivalent that applies a signal via a coupling capacitor
Cc. Note that this signal source has been returned to the emitter, which implies that the emitter resistor bypass
capacitor CE has been treated as a short circuit at all signal frequencies for the purposes of this analysis.
Because the top of biasing resistor R1 (Figure 3.29) is taken to ground via the power supply insofar as the
signal is concerned, it appears in parallel with R2, and the emitter is also grounded to the signal via CE. That is,
a composite biasing resistance to ground RB appears:
RB ¼ R1 · R2
R1 þ R2
Finally, the collector load is taken to ground via the power supply and hence to the emitter via CE.
Figure 3.32 shows that vbe is ampliﬁed independently of frequency, so the terminal voltage gain Av may
easily be determined:
Av ¼ vce
vbe
¼ icRL
vbe
Now:
vbe ¼ vb0eðrbb0 þ rb0eÞ
rb0e

and
ic ¼ gmvb0erce
rce þ RL
. gmvb0e
because rb0e .. rbb0 and rce .. RL. So:
Av . gmRL
which is as expected.
The model shows that vbe is ampliﬁed independently of frequency because there are no capacitances to its
right, so an analysis of low-frequency response devolves down to determining vbe in terms of e. Here, part of e
will appear across the capacitive reactance XCc, and the remainder is vbe. So, to make the concept of reactance
valid, a sinusoidal signal E must be postulated, giving a sinusoidal value for vbe ¼ Vbe.

Since a single RC time constant is involved, the voltage gain of the CE stage will appear to fall at 6 dB/octave as
the frequency is reduced because more and more of the signal is dropped across Cc. However, even if CE is very
large, it too will contribute to a fall in gain as it allows more and more of the output signal to be dropped
across the REkXCE combination, this being applied also to the input loop, resulting in negative feedback. So, at
very low frequencies, the gain roll-off will tend to 12 dB/octave. The question therefore arises of how large CE
should be, and this can be conveniently answered by considering a second basic form of transistor connection
as follows.
The Emitter-Follower or Common-Collector (CC) Circuit
Suppose that RC is short-circuited in the circuit of Figure 3.29. This will not affect the biasing because the
collector voltage may take any value (the output characteristic is nearly horizontal, as seen in Figure 3.28).
3-26
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

However, the small-signal output voltage ceases to exist because there is now no load resistor across which it
can be developed, although the output current ic will continue to ﬂow as before.
If now CE is removed, ic ﬂows entirely through RE and develops a voltage that can be observed at the emitter
ieRE ð.icREÞ. Consider the magnitude of this voltage. Figure 3.26(a) shows that for a normally operating
transistor, the signal component of the base-emitter voltage DVBE (or vbe) is very small indeed, whereas the
constant component needed for biasing is normally about 0.6 to 0.7 V. That is, vbe p VBE. This implies that
the emitter voltage must always follow the base voltage but at a dc level about 0.6 to 0.7 V below it. So, if an
output signal is taken from the emitter, it is almost the same as the input signal at the base. In other words, the
voltage gain of an emitter follower is almost unity.
If this is the case, what is the use of the emitter follower? The answer is that because the signal current gain is
unchanged at ie=ib ¼ ðhfe þ 1Þ . hfe, then the power gain must also be about hfe. This means in turn that the
output resistance must be the resistance ‘‘looking into’’ the transistor from the emitter, divided by hfe. If the
parallel combination of Rg and the bias resistors is RG, then:
RoutðCCÞ ¼ RG þ rbb0 þ rb0e
hfe
ð3:19Þ
where RG ¼ RgkR1kR2ðor RgBÞ.
If a voltage generator with zero internal resistance (Rg ¼ 0) were applied to the input, then this would
become
RoutðCCÞ ¼ rbb0 þ rb0e
hfe
and if rb0e .. rbb0 (which is usual), then:
RoutðCCÞ . rb0e
hfe
¼ 1
gm
ð3:20Þ
Consider the numerical implications of this: if IC ¼ 1 mA, then gm . 39 mA=V (at room temperature), so
1=gm . 26 O, which is a very low output resistance indeed. In fact, although it appears in parallel with RE, it is
unlikely that RE will make any signiﬁcant contribution because it is usually hundreds or thousands of ohms.
Example 4
Using the same bias resistors as for the CE examples, ﬁnd the output resistance at the emitter of a CC stage.
Solution.
The parallel resistances to the left of the base are
RG ¼ RgkR1kR2 ¼ 5k75k39 < 4:2 kO
Using Equation (3.19):
Rout < RG þ rb0e
hfe

where gm < 39IC, IQ ¼ 1 mA, and hfe ¼ 110, so:
RoutðCCÞ < 4200

39 < 63:8 O
From values like this, it is clear that the output of an emitter follower can be thought of as a good practical
dependent voltage source of very low internal resistance.
3-27
Transistors

The converse is also true: the input at the base presents a high resistance. This is simply because whereas
much the same signal voltage appears at the base as at the emitter, the base signal current ib is smaller than the
emitter signal current ie by a factor of ðhfe þ 1Þ . hfe. Hence, the apparent resistance at the base must be at
least hfeRE. To this must be added rbb0þrb0e so that:
RinðCCÞ . rbb0 þ rb0e þ hfeRE
ð3:21aÞ
Now hfe is rarely less than about 100, so hfeRE is usually predominant and
RinðCCÞ . hfeRE
ð3:21bÞ
The emitter-follower circuit is therefore a buffer stage because
it can accept a signal at a high resistance level without
signiﬁcant attenuation and reproduce it at a low resistance
level and with no phase shift (except at high frequencies).
In this conﬁguration, the unbypassed emitter resistor RE
is obviously in series with the input circuit as well as the
output circuit. Hence, it is actually a feedback resistor and
so may be given the alternative symbol RF, as in Figure 3.33.
Because all the output signal voltage is fed back in series
with the input, this represents 100% voltage-derived series
negative feedback.
The hybrid-p model for the bipolar transistor may now
be inserted into the emitter-follower circuit of Figure 3.33, resulting in Figure 3.34, from which the four
midfrequency parameters may be obtained. As an example of the procedures involved, consider the derivation
of the voltage gain expression.

The Common-Emitter Bypass Capacitor CE
In a CE circuit such as that of Figure 3.29, suppose Cc is large so that the low-frequency –3-dB point fL is
deﬁned only by the parallel combination of the resistance at the emitter and CE. It will now be seen why the
emitter-follower work is relevant: the resistance appearing at the emitter of the CE stage is the same as the
output resistance of the emitter-follower stage, and this will now appear in parallel with RE. If this parallel
resistance is renamed Remitter, then, neglecting rbb0:
Remitter ¼ RoutðCCÞkRE . RG þ rb0e

and if CE were to deﬁne fL, then:

In Example 4, let Cc be large so that only CE deﬁnes fL at 42 Hz, and ﬁnd the value of CE.
FIGURE 3.34
An emitter-follower equivalent circuit for low frequencies.
3-29
Transistors

Solution.
In the emitter-follower example, where Rg ¼ 5 kO, Rout(CC) was found to be 63.8 O, and this is the
same as Remitter in the present case. Therefore:
CE ¼
106
2p63:8 · 42 . 60 mF
This is the value of CE that would deﬁne fL if Cc were large. However, if CE is to act as a short circuit at this
frequency, thus allowing Cc to deﬁne fL, then its value would have to be one or two orders of magnitude
greater, that is, 600 to 6000 mF.
Summarizing, three possibilities exist:
1. If CE is very large, Cc deﬁnes fL and a 6-dB/octave roll-off results.
2. If Cc is large, CE deﬁnes fL and again a 6-dB/octave roll-off results.
3. If both Cc and CE act together, a 12-dB/octave roll-off results.
In point of fact, at frequencies much less than fL, both conditions (1) and (2) eventually produce 12-dB/
octave roll-offs as the alternate ‘‘large’’ capacitors come into play at very low frequencies; but since the
ampliﬁer will not still have a useful gain at such frequencies, this is of little importance.
High-Frequency Response
Unlike the low-frequency response situation, the high-frequency response is governed by the small distributed
capacitances inside the transistor structure, and these have been lumped together in the hybrid-p model of
Figure 3.31 as Cb0e and Cb0c. At high frequencies, rb0c may be neglected in comparison with the reactance of
Cb0c, so the model may be simpliﬁed as in Figure 3.35(a). From this it will be seen that Cb0c is a capacitance
FIGURE 3.35
(a) The high-frequency hybrid-p model and (b) its simpliﬁcation.
3-30
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

that appears from the output to the input so that it may be converted by the Miller effect into a capacitance at
the input of value:
Cb0cð1  AvÞ ¼ Cb0cð1 þ gmRCÞ
This will now add to Cb0e to give Cin:
Cin ¼ Cb0e þ Cb0cð1 þ gmRCÞ
ð3:24Þ
This simpliﬁcation is shown in Figure 3.35(b), where Cin is seen to be shunted by the input parts of the model.
These input parts may be reduced by sequential use of The´venin–Norton transformations to result in
Figure 3.36, which is a simple parallel RC circuit driven by a current source. The actual value of this current
source is immaterial—what matters is that the input signal to be ampliﬁed, vb0e, will be progressively reduced
as the frequency rises and the reactance of Cin falls.
Using a sinusoidal source, Vb0e will be 3 dB down when R ¼ j XCin j, which gives
R ¼
1
2pfHCin
or
fH ¼

2pRCin
ð3:25Þ
where R ¼ ðRG þ rbb0Þkrb0e from the circuit reduction.
Complete Response
Now that both the low- and high-frequency roll-offs have been related to single time constants (except when
Cc and CE act together), it is clear that the complete frequency response will look like Figure 3.37, where the
midband voltage gain is Av ¼ –gmRC.
Design Comments
The design of a simple single-transistor ampliﬁer stage has now been covered in terms of both biasing and
small-signal performance. These two concepts have been kept separate, but it will have been noticed that they
are bridged by the transconductance, because gm ¼ ðq=kTÞIQ (.39IQ at room temperature). That is, when IQ
has been determined, then the small-signal performance follows from expressions involving gm.
In fact, once the quiescent voltage across the load resistor of a CE stage has been determined, the voltage
gain follows from this, irrespective of the values of IQ and RC.
If the quiescent voltage at the collector is Vout, then in dc biasing terms:
VRC ¼ IQRC ¼ ðVCC  VoutÞ
FIGURE 3.36
Simpliﬁcation of the input part of the high-frequency hybrid-p model.
3-31
Transistors

and in small-signal terms:
Av ¼ gmRC > 39IQRC
ðat 25–CÞ ¼ 39ðVCC  VoutÞ
Thus, gm really does act as a bridge between the bias and the small-signal conditions for the bipolar transistor
ampliﬁer stage.
Unfortunately, however, there are serious problems with such a stage from a practical viewpoint. For
example, it cannot amplify down to dc because of the existence of Cc; and if a larger gain is needed, the
cascading of such stages will present problems of phase shift and hence feedback stability. Furthermore, it
cannot be produced in IC form because of the incorporation of large capacitances and somewhat critical and
high-valued resistors. This leads to a reevaluation of the basic tenets of circuit design, and these can be
summed up as follows: circuit design using discrete components is largely concerned with voltage drops across
resistors (as has been seen), but the design of ICs depends extensively on currents and current sources and sinks.
Integrated Circuits
Monolithic ICs are fabricated on single chips of silicon or dice (the singular being die). This means that the
active and passive structures on the chips are manufactured all at the same time, so it is easy to ensure that a
large number of such structures are identical, or bear some ﬁxed ratio to one another, but it is more difﬁcult to
establish precise values for such sets of structures. For example, a set of transistors may all exhibit almost the
same values of hFE, but the actual numerical value of hFE may be subject to wider tolerances. Similarly, many
pairs of resistors may bear a ratio n:1 to each other, but the actual values of these resistors are more difﬁcult to
deﬁne. So, in IC design, it is very desirable to exploit the close similarity of devices (or close ratios) rather than
depend upon their having predictable absolute values. This approach has led to two ubiquitous circuit
conﬁgurations, both of which depend upon device similarity: the long-tailed pair or difference ampliﬁer
(often called the differential ampliﬁer) and the current mirror. This section will treat both, and the former is
best introduced by considering the degenerate common-emitter stage.
The Degenerate Common-Emitter Stage
Consider two CE stages that are identical in every respect but which have no emitter resistor bypass capacitors,
as shown in Figure 3.38. Also, notice that in these diagrams, two power supply rails have been used, a positive
one at V þ
CC and a negative one at V –
CC. The reason for this latter, negative, rail is that the bases may be
FIGURE 3.37
The complete frequency response.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

operated via signal sources referred to a common line or ground. (If, for example, V þ
CC and V –
CC are obtained
from batteries as shown, then the common line is simply the junction of the two batteries, as is also shown.)
The absence of capacitors now means that ampliﬁcation down to dc is possible.
It is now very easy to ﬁnd the quiescent collector currents IQ because from a dc bias point of view the bases
are connected to ground via resistances Rg, which will be taken as having low values so that they drop
negligibly small voltages. Hence:
IQ ¼ jV

Now suppose that identical signals e are applied. At each collector, this will result in an output signal voltage

Note that the input resistance to each base is as for the emitter-follower stage:
RinðdCEÞ ¼ rbb0 þ rb0e þ hfeRF . hfeRF
Now consider what happens if the emitters are connected together as in Figure 3.39, where the two resistors RF
have now become RX, where RX ¼ ½RF.
The two quiescent emitter currents now combine to give IX ¼ 2IE . 2IC, and otherwise the circuit currents
and voltages remain undisturbed. So, if the two input signals are identical, then the two output signals will also
be identical. This circuit is now called a difference ampliﬁer, and the reason will become obvious as soon as the
two input signals differ.
The Difference Ampliﬁer
In Figure 3.39, if e1 ¼ e2, these are called common-mode input signals, ein(CM), and they will be ampliﬁed
by –RC/RF as for the degenerate CE stage. However, if e1 6¼ e2, then e1 – e2 ¼ ein, the difference input signal.
The following deﬁnitions now apply:
e1 þ e2
2
¼ einðCMÞ
the common mode component
and
6ðe1  e2Þ
2
¼ einðdiffÞ
the difference component; or 1
2 ein
Hence, e1 ¼ ein(CM) þ ein(diff) and e2 ¼ ein(CM) – ein(diff).
Consider the progress of a signal current driven by e1 – e2 and entering the base of Q1. It will ﬁrst pass
through Rg, then into the resistance Rin at the base of Q1, and will arrive at the emitter of Q2. Here, if RX is
large, most of this signal current will pass into the resistance presented by the Q2 emitter and eventually out of
the Q2 base via another Rg to ground. The total series resistance is therefore:
Rg þ Rin ¼ Rg þ rbb0 þ rb0e þ hfeRemitterð2Þ
FIGURE 3.39

However:
Remitterð2Þ ¼ Rg þ rbb0 þ rb0e

so
Rg þ Rin ¼ 2ðRg þ rbb0 þ rb0eÞ
which is the resistance between the two signal sources. Hence:
ibð1Þ ¼ ibð2Þ ¼

2ðRg þ rbb0 þ rb0eÞ
giving
vcð1Þ ¼ vcð2Þ ¼

so that the overall difference voltage gain to each collector is
Aov ¼

If the voltage gain with the input signal measured between the actual bases is needed, Rg can be removed to
give
Av ¼
6hfeRC
2ðrbb 0 þ rb 0eÞ
ð3:28bÞ
Finally, if the output signal is measured between the collectors (which will be twice that at each collector
because they are in antiphase), the difference-in-to-difference-out voltage gain will be
AvðdiffÞ ¼
hfeRC
rbb0 þ rb0e
. hfeRC
rb0e
¼ gmRC
ð3:28cÞ
which is the same as for a single CE stage.
Note that this is considerably larger than the gain for a common-mode input signal; that is, the difference stage
ampliﬁes difference signals well but largely rejects common-mode signals. This common-mode rejection
property is very useful, for often, small signals appear across leads, both of which may contain identical electrical
noise. So, the difference stage tends to reject the noise while still amplifying the signal. Furthermore, the difference
stage has the advantage that it needs no coupling or bypass capacitors and so will amplify frequencies down to
zero (dc). Also, it is very stable biaswise and lends itself perfectly to realization on a monolithic IC.
To make the above derivation valid, the long-tail resistance RX should be as large as possible so that most of
the signal current enters the emitter of Q2. However, RX must also carry the quiescent current, which would
produce a very high quiescent voltage drop and so require a very high value of V –
CC. To overcome this, another
transistor structure can be used within a conﬁguration known as a current mirror.
3-35
Transistors

The Current Mirror
The two transistors in Figure 3.40 are assumed to be identical, and Q1 has its base and collector connected so
that it acts simply as a diode (formed by the base-emitter junction). The current through it is therefore:
I ¼ VCC  VBE
R
ð3:29Þ
The voltage drop VBE so produced is applied to Q2 as shown so that it is forced to carry the same collector
current I; that is, it mirrors the current in Q1.
The transistor Q2 is now a device that carries a dc IC(2) ¼ I but presents a large incremental resistance rce at
its collector. This is exactly what is required by the difference ampliﬁer pair, so it may be used in place of RX.
The Difference Stage with Current Mirror Biasing
Figure 3.41 shows a complete difference stage complete with a current mirror substituting for the long-tail
resistor RX, where the emitter quiescent currents combine to give IX:
Ix ¼ Vccþ þ jVccj  VBEð3Þ

This quiescent or bias current is very stable because the change in VBE(3) due to temperature variations is
exactly matched by that required by Q4 to produce the same current. The difference gain will be as discussed
above, but the common-mode gain will be extremely low because of the high incremental resistance rce
presented by the long-tail transistor.
The Current Mirror as a Load
A second current mirror can be used as a load for the difference ampliﬁer, as shown in Figure 3.42. This must
utilize pnp transistor structures so that the Q6 collector loads the Q2 collector with a large incremental resistance
rce(6), making for an extremely highvoltage gain. Furthermore, Q5 and Q6 combine the signal output currents of
both Q1 and Q2 to perform a double-ended-to-single-ended conversion as follows. Taking signal currents:
iout ¼ icð6Þ  icð2Þ
However:
icð6Þ ¼ icð5Þ
by current mirror action, and
icð5Þ ¼ icð1Þ
so
icð6Þ ¼ icð1Þ
Also:
icð2Þ ¼ icð1Þ

by difference ampliﬁer action, so:
iout ¼ icð1Þ þ icð1Þ ¼ 2icð1Þ
ð3:31Þ
Thus, both sides of the long-tailed pair are used to provide an output current that may then be applied to
further stages to form a complete ampliﬁer. Also, because no capacitors and only one resistor are needed, it is
an easy circuit for monolithic integration on a single die.
Summary
It has been shown how a limited knowledge of bipolar operation can lead to properly biased ampliﬁer stages
using discrete transistors. An equivalent circuit—the hybrid-p model—was then derived, again from limited
information, which made possible the analysis of such stages, and some purely practical design results were
favorably compared with its predictions. Finally, the tenets of this equivalent circuit were used to evaluate the
performance of the difference ampliﬁer and current mirror circuits, which are the cornerstones of modern
electronic circuit design in a very wide variety of its manifestations. These circuits are, in fact, the classic
transconductance and translinear elements that are ubiquitous in modern IC signal conditioning and function
networks.
It should be recognized that there are many models other than the one introduced here, from the simple but
very common h-parameter version to complex and comprehensive versions developed for computer-aided
design (CAD) methods. However, the present elementary approach has been from a design rather than an
analytical direction, for it is obvious that powerful modern computer-oriented methods such as the SPICE
variants become useful only when a basic circuit conﬁguration has been established, and at the time of writing,
this is still the province of the human designer.

3.3
The Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect
Transistor (MOSFET)
John R. Brews (revised by Harvey J. Stiegler)
The MOSFET is a transistor that uses a control electrode, the gate, to capacitively modulate the
conductance of a surface channel joining two end contacts, the source, and the drain. The gate is separated
from the semiconductor body underlying the gate by a thin gate insulator, usually silicon dioxide. The
surface channel is formed at the interface between the semiconductor body and the gate insulator (see
Figure 3.43).
The MOSFET can be understood by contrasting with other ﬁeld-effect devices, like the JFET or junction
ﬁeld-effect transistor, and the MESFET or metal semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (Hollis and Murphy,
1990). These other transistors modulate the conductance of a majority-carrier path between two ohmic
contacts by capacitive control of its cross section. (Majority carriers are those in greatest abundance in a ﬁeld-
free semiconductor, electrons in n-type material and holes in p-type material.) This modulation of the cross
section can take place at any point along the length of the channel, so the gate electrode can be positioned
anywhere and need not extend the entire length of the channel.
FIGURE 3.43
A high-performance n-channel MOSFET. The device is isolated from its neighbors by a surrounding thick
ﬁeld oxide under which is a heavily doped channel stop implant intended to suppress accidental channel formation that
could couple the device to its neighbors. The drain contacts are placed over the ﬁeld oxide to reduce the capacitance to the
body, a parasitic that slows response times. These structural details are described later. (Source: after Brews, 1990.)
3-39
Transistors

Analogous to these ﬁeld-effect devices is the buried-channel, depletion-mode, or normally-on MOSFET,
which contains a surface layer of the same doping type as the source and drain (opposite type to the
semiconductor body of the device). As a result, it has a built-in or normally-on channel from source to drain
with a conductance that is reduced when the gate depletes the majority carriers.
In contrast, the true MOSFET is an enhancement-mode or normally-off device. The device is normally off
because the body forms pn-junctions with both the source and the drain, so no majority-carrier current can
ﬂow between them. Instead, minority-carrier current can ﬂow provided minority carriers are available. As
discussed later, for gate biases that are sufﬁciently attractive, above threshold, minority carriers are drawn into
a surface channel, forming a conducting path from source to drain. The gate and channel then form two sides
of a capacitor separated by the gate insulator. As additional attractive charges are placed on the gate side, the
channel side of the capacitor draws a balancing charge of minority carriers from the source and the drain. The
more charges on the gate, the more populated the channel, and the larger the conductance. Because the gate
creates the channel, to ensure electrical continuity, the gate must extend over the entire length of the separation
between source and drain.
The MOSFET channel is created by attraction to the gate and relies upon the insulating layer between the
channel and the gate to prevent leakage of minority carriers to the gate. As a result, MOSFETs can be made
only in material systems that provide very good gate insulators, and the best-known system is the silicon–
silicon dioxide combination. This requirement for a good gate insulator is not so important for JFETs and
MESFETs, where the role of the gate is to push away majority carriers rather than to attract minority carriers.
Thus, in Ga–As systems where good insulators are incompatible with other device or fabrication requirements,
MESFETs are used.
A more recent development in Ga–As systems is the heterostructure ﬁeld-effect transistor or HFET (Pearton
and Shaw, 1990), made up of layers of varying compositions of Al, Ga, and As or In, Ga, P, and As. These
devices may be made using, for example, molecular beam epitaxy or by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy.
HFETs include a variety of structures, the best known of which is the modulation-doped FET, or MODFET.
HFETs are ﬁeld-effect devices, not MOSFETs, because the gate simply modulates the carrier density in a
preexistent channel between ohmic contacts. The channel is formed spontaneously, regardless of the quality of
the gate insulator as a condition of equilibrium between the layers, just as a depletion layer is formed in a pn
junction. The resulting channel is created very near to the gate electrode, resulting in gate control as effective as
in a MOSFET.
The silicon-based MOSFET has been successful primarily because the silicon–silicon dioxide system
provides a stable interface with low trap densities, and because the oxide is impermeable to many
environmental contaminants, has a high breakdown strength, and is easy to grow uniformly and
reproducibly (Nicollian and Brews, 1982). These attributes allow easy fabrication using lithographic
processes, resulting in integrated circuits (ICs), with very small devices, very large device counts, and
very high reliability at low cost. Because the importance of the MOSFET lies in this relationship to high-
density manufacture, an emphasis of this section is to describe the issues involved in continuing
miniaturization.
An additional advantage of the MOSFET is that it can be made using either electrons or holes as
channel carriers. Using both types of devices in so-called complementary MOS (CMOS) technology allows
circuits that draw essentially no dc power if current paths include at least one series connection of both
types of device because, in steady state, only one or the other type conducts, not both at once. Of course,
in exercising the circuit, power is drawn during switching of the devices. This ﬂexibility in choosing n- or
p-channel devices has enabled large circuits to be made that use low power levels. Hence, complex systems
can be manufactured without expensive packaging or cooling requirements.
Current–Voltage Characteristics
The derivation of the current–voltage characteristics of the MOSFET can be found in several sources (Brews,
1981; Annaratone, 1986; Pierret, 1990). Here a qualitative discussion is provided.
3-40
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Strong-Inversion Characteristics
In Figure 3.44 the source-drain current ID is plotted vs. drain-to-source voltage VD (the I–V curves for the
MOSFET). At low VD the current increases approximately linearly with increased VD, behaving like a simple
resistor with a resistance that is controlled by the gate voltage VG. As the gate voltage is made more attractive
for channel carriers, the channel becomes stronger, more carriers are contained in the channel, and its
resistance Rch drops. Hence, at larger VG the current is larger.
At large VD the curves ﬂatten out, and the current is less sensitive to drain bias. The MOSFET is said to be in
saturation. There are different reasons for this behavior, depending upon the ﬁeld along the channel caused by
the drain voltage. If the source-drain separation is short, where ‘‘short’’ is technology dependent but generally
denotes a distance in the submicrometer regime, the usual drain voltage is sufﬁcient to create ﬁelds along the
channel of more than a few · 104 V/cm. In this case the carrier energy is sufﬁcient for carriers to lose energy by
causing vibrations of the silicon atoms composing the crystal (optical phonon emission). Consequently, the
carrier velocity does not increase much with increased ﬁeld, saturating at a value usat < 107 cm=sec in silicon
MOSFETs. Because the carriers do not move faster with increased VD, the current also saturates.
For longer devices the current–voltage curves saturate for a different reason. Consider the potential along
the insulator-channel interface, the surface potential. Whatever the surface potential is at the source end of the
channel, it varies from the source end to a value larger at the drain end by VD because the drain potential is VD
higher than the source. The gate, on the other hand, is at the same potential everywhere. Thus, the difference
in potential between the gate and the source is larger than that between the gate and the drain.
Correspondingly, the oxide ﬁeld at the source is larger than that at the drain, and as a result less charge can be
supported at the drain. This reduction in attractive power of the gate reduces the number of carriers in the
FIGURE 3.44
Drain current ID vs. drain voltage VD for various choices of gate bias VG. The dashed-line curves are for a
long-channel device for which the current in saturation increases quadratically with gate bias. The solid-line curves are for a
short-channel device that is approaching velocity saturation and thus exhibits a more linear increase in saturation current
with gate bias, as discussed in the text.

Transistors

channel at the drain end, increasing channel resistance. In short, we have ID < VD=Rch, but the channel
resistance Rch ¼ RchðVDÞ is increasing with VD. As a result, the current–voltage curves do not continue along
the initial straight line, but bend over and saturate.
Another difference between the current–voltage curves for short devices and those for long devices is the
dependence on gate voltage. For long devices, the current level in saturation, ID,sat, increases quadratically with
gate bias. The reason is that the number of carriers in the channel is proportional to VG  VTH (where VTH is
the threshold voltage), as is discussed later, the channel resistance Rch ~ 1=ðVG  VTHÞ, and the drain bias in
saturation is approximately VG. Thus, ID;sat ¼ VD=Rch ~ ðVG  VTHÞ2, and we have quadratic dependence.
When the carrier velocity is saturated, however, the dependence of the current on drain bias is suppressed
because the speed of the carriers is ﬁxed at usat, and ID;sat ~ usat=Rch ~ ðVG  VTHÞusat, a linear gate-voltage
dependence. As a result, the current available from a short device is not as large as would be expected if we
assumed it behaved like a long device.
Subthreshold Characteristics
Quite different current–voltage behavior is seen in subthreshold, that is, for gate biases so low that the channel
is in weak inversion. In this case the number of carriers in the channel is so small that their charge does not
affect the potential, and channel carriers simply must adapt to the potential set up by the electrodes and the
dopant ions. Likewise, in subthreshold any ﬂow of current is so small that it causes no potential drop along the
interface, which becomes an equipotential region.
As there is no lateral ﬁeld to move the channel carriers, they move by diffusion only, driven by a gradient in
carrier density set up because the drain is effective in reducing the carrier density at the drain end of the
channel. In the subthreshold the current is then independent of drain bias once this bias exceeds a few tens of
millivolts, enough to reduce the carrier density at the drain end of the channel to near zero.
In short devices, however, the source and drain are close enough together to begin to share control of the
potential with the gate. If this effect is too strong, a drain-voltage dependence of the subthreshold
characteristic then occurs, which is undesirable, because it increases the MOSFET off current and can cause a
drain-bias dependent threshold voltage.
Although for a well-designed device there is no drain-voltage dependence in subthreshold, gate-bias
dependence is exponential. The surface is lowered in energy relative to the semiconductor body by the action
of the gate. If this surface potential is fS below that of the body, the carrier density is enhanced by a Boltzmann
factor expðqfS=kTÞ relative to the body concentration, where kT/q ¼ the thermal voltage < 25 mV at 290 K.
As fS is roughly proportional to VG, this exponential dependence on fS leads to an exponential dependence
upon VG for the carrier density and, hence, for the current in subthreshold.
Important Device Parameters
A number of MOSFET parameters are important to the performance of a MOSFET. In this subsection some of
these parameters are discussed, particularly from the viewpoint of digital ICs.
Threshold Voltage
The threshold voltage is vaguely deﬁned as the gate voltage VTH at which the channel begins to form. At this
voltage devices begin to switch from ‘‘off’’ to ‘‘on,’’ and circuits depend on a voltage swing that straddles this
value. Thus, threshold voltage helps in deciding the necessary supply voltage for circuit operation, and also it
helps in determining the leakage or ‘‘off’’ current that ﬂows when the device is in the off state.
Threshold voltage is controlled by oxide thickness d and by body doping. To control the body doping, ion
implantation is used so that the dopant-ion density is not simply a uniform extension of the bulk, background
level NB ions/unit volume but has superimposed upon it an implanted-ion density. To estimate the threshold
voltage, we need a picture of what happens in the semiconductor under the gate as the gate voltage is changed
from its off level toward threshold.
If we imagine changing the gate bias from its off condition toward threshold, at ﬁrst the result is to repel
majority carriers, forming a surface depletion layer (refer to Figure 3.43). In the depletion layer there are almost
3-42
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

no carriers present, but there are dopant ions. In n-type material these dopant ions are positive donor
impurities that cannot move under ﬁelds because they are locked in the silicon lattice, where they have been
deliberately introduced to replace silicon atoms. In p-type material these dopant ions are negative acceptors.
Thus, each charge added to the gate electrode to bring the gate voltage closer to threshold causes an increase in
the depletion-layer width sufﬁcient to balance the gate charge by an equal but opposite charge of dopant ions
in the silicon depletion layer.
This expansion of the depletion layer continues to balance the addition of gate charge until threshold is
reached. Then this charge response changes: above threshold any additional gate charge is balanced by an
increasingly strong inversion layer or channel. The border between a depletion-layer and an inversion-layer
response, threshold, should occur when:
dqNinv
dfS
¼ dQD
dfS
ð3:32Þ
where dfS is the small change in surface potential that corresponds to our incremental change in gate charge,
qNinv is the inversion-layer charge/unit area, and QD is the depletion-layer charge/unit area. According to
Equation (3.32), the two types of response are equal at threshold, so one is larger than the other on either side
of this condition. To be more quantitative, the rate of increase in qNinv is exponential; that is, its rate of change
is proportional to qNinv, so as qNinv increases, so does the left side of Equation (3.32). However, QD has a
square-root dependence on fS, which means its rate of change becomes smaller as QD increases. Thus, as
surface potential is increased, the left side of Equation (3.32) increases proportional to qNinv until, at
threshold, Equation (3.32) is satisﬁed. Then, beyond threshold, the exponential increase in qNinv with fS
swamps QD, making change in qNinv the dominant response. Likewise, below threshold, the exponential
decrease in qNinv with decreasing fS makes qNinv negligible and change in QD becomes the dominant response.
The abruptness of this change in behavior is the reason for the term threshold to describe MOSFET switching.
To use Equation (3.32) to ﬁnd a formula for threshold voltage, we need expressions for Ninv and QD. Assuming
the interface is held at a lower energy than the bulk due to the charge on the gate, the minority-carrier density
at the interfaceis larger than in the bulk semiconductor, even below threshold. Below threshold and even up to the
threshold of Equation (3.32), the number of charges in the channel/unit area Ninv is given for n channel devices
approximately by (Brews, 1981):
Ninv < dINV
n2
i
NB
eqðfSVSÞ=kT
ð3:33Þ
where the various symbols are deﬁned as follows: ni ¼ intrinsic carrier density/unit volume < 1010/cm3 in
silicon at 290 K and VS ¼ body reverse bias, if any. The ﬁrst factor, dINV, is an effective depth of minority
carriers from the interface given by
dINV ¼ eSkT=q
QD
ð3:34Þ
where QD ¼ depletion-layer charge/unit area due to charged dopant ions in the region where there are no
carriers and eS is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor.
Equation (3.33) expresses the net minority-carrier density/unit area as the product of the bulk minority-
carrier density/unit volume, n2
i =NB, with the depth of the minority-carrier distribution dINV multiplied in turn
by the customary Boltzmann factor exp½qðfS  VSÞ=kT	 expressing the enhancement of the interface density
over the bulk due to lower energy at the interface. The depth dINV is related to the carrier distribution near the
interface using the approximation (valid in weak inversion) that the minority-carrier density decays
exponentially with distance from the oxide-silicon surface. In this approximation, dINV is the centroid of the
minority-carrier density. For example, for a uniform bulk doping of 1016 dopant ions/cm3 at 290 K, using
3-43
Transistors

Equation (3.33) and the surface potential at threshold from Equation (3.38) below (f TH ¼ 0.69 V), there
are QD=q ¼ 3 · 1011charges=cm2 in the depletion layer at threshold. This QD corresponds to a dINV ¼ 5.4
nm and a carrier density at threshold of Ninv ¼ 5:4 · 109charges=cm2.
The next step in using the deﬁnition of threshold, Equation (3.32), is to introduce the depletion-layer
charge/unit area QD. For the ion-implanted case, QD is made up of two terms (Brews, 1981):
QD ¼ qNBLBf2½qfTH=ðkTÞ  m1  1	g1=2 þ qDI
ð3:35Þ
where the ﬁrst term is QB, the depletion-layer charge from bulk dopant atoms in the depletion layer with a
width that has been reduced by the ﬁrst moment of the implant, namely, m1 given in terms of the centroid of
the implant xC by
m1 ¼ DIxC
NBL2
B
ð3:36Þ
The second term is the additional charge due to the implanted-ion density within the depletion layer, DI ions
per unit area. The Debye length LB is deﬁned as
L2
B  kT
q
eS
qNB
ð3:37Þ
where eS is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor. The Debye length is a measure of how deeply a
variation of surface potential penetrates into the body when DI ¼ 0 and the depletion layer is of zero width.
Approximating qNinv by Equation (3.33) and QD by Equation (3.35), Equation (3.32) determines the
surface potential at threshold, fTH, to be
fTH ¼ 2 kT
q ln NB
ni
þ kT
q ln 1 þ qDI
QB


ð3:38Þ
where the new symbols are deﬁned as follows: QB ¼ depletion-layer charge/unit area due to bulk body dopant
NB in the depletion layer, and qDI ¼ depletion-layer charge/unit area due to implanted ions in the depletion
layer between the inversion-layer edge and the depletion-layer edge. Because even a small increase in fS above
fTH causes a large increase in qNinv, which can balance a rather large change in gate charge or gate voltage, fS
does not increase much as VG – VTH increases. Nonetheless, in strong inversion, Ninv < 1012charges/cm2, so in
strong inversion fS will be about 10kT=q larger than fTH.
Equation (3.38) indicates for uniform doping (no implant, DI ¼ 0) that threshold occurs approximately for
fS ¼ fTH ¼ 2ðkT=qÞ lnðNB=niÞ  2fB, but for the nonuniformly doped case a larger surface potential is
needed, assuming the case of a normal implant where DI is positive, increasing the dopant density. The
implant increases the required surface potential because the ﬁeld at the surface is larger, narrowing the
inversion layer and reducing the channel strength for fS ¼ 2fB. Hence, a somewhat larger surface potential is
needed to increase qNinv to the point that Equation (3.32) is satisﬁed. Equation (3.38) would not apply if a
signiﬁcant fraction of the implant were conﬁned to lie within the inversion layer itself. However, no realistic
implant can be conﬁned within a distance comparable to an inversion-layer thickness (a few tens of
nanometers), so Equation (3.38) covers practical cases.
With the surface potential fTH known, the potential on the gate at threshold FTH can be found if we know
the oxide ﬁeld Fox by simply adding the potential drop across the semiconductor to that across the oxide. That
is, FTH ¼ fTH þ Foxd, with d ¼ oxide thickness and Fox is given by Gauss’s law as
eoxFox ¼ QD

There are two more complications in ﬁnding the threshold voltage. First, the gate voltage VTH usually differs
from the gate potential FTH at threshold because of a work-function difference between the body and the gate
material. This difference causes a spontaneous charge exchange between the two materials as soon as the
MOSFET is placed in a circuit allowing charge transfer to occur. Thus, even before any voltage is applied to
the device, a potential difference exists between the gate and the body due to spontaneous charge transfer. The
second complication affecting threshold voltage is the existence of charges in the insulator and at the
insulator–semiconductor interface. These nonideal contributions to the overall charge balance are due to traps
and ﬁxed charges incorporated during the device processing.
Ordinarily, interface-trap charge is negligible (,1010/cm2 in silicon MOSFETs), and the other nonideal
effects upon threshold voltage are accounted for by introducing the ﬂatband voltage VFB, which corrects the
gate bias for these contributions. Then, using Equation (3.39) with Fox ¼ ðVTH  VFB  fTHÞ=d we ﬁnd:
VTH ¼ VFB þ fTH þ QD
d
eox
ð3:40Þ
which determines VTH even for the nonuniformly doped case, using Equation (3.38) for fTH and QD at
threshold from Equation (3.35). If interface-trap charge/unit area is not negligible, then terms in the interface-
trap charge/unit area QIT must be added to QD in Equation (3.40).
From Equation (3.35) and Equation (3.38), the threshold voltage depends upon the implanted dopant-ion
proﬁle only through two parameters, the net charge introduced by the implant in the region between the
inversion layer and the depletion-layer edge qDI, and the centroid of this portion of the implanted charge xC.
As a result, a variety of implants can result in the same threshold, ranging from the extreme of a d-function
spike implant of dose DI/unit area located at the centroid xC, to a box-type rectangular distribution with the
same dose and centroid, namely, a rectangular distribution of width xW ¼ 2xC and volume density DI/xW (of
course, xW must be no larger than the depletion-layer width at threshold for this equivalence to hold true, and
xC must not lie within the inversion layer). This weak dependence on the details of the proﬁle leaves ﬂexibility
to satisfy other requirements, such as control of off current.
As already said, for gate biases VG > VTH any gate charge above the threshold value is balanced mainly by
inversion-layer charge. Thus, the additional oxide ﬁeld, given by ðVG  VTHÞ=d, is related by Gauss’s law to the
inversion-layer carrier density approximately by
eox
VG  VTH
d
< qNinv
ð3:41Þ
which shows that channel strength above threshold is proportional to VG  VTH, an approximation often used in
this section. Thus, the switch in balancing gate charge from the depletion layer to the inversion layercauses Ninv to
switch from an exponential gate-voltage dependence in subthreshold to a linear dependence above threshold.
For circuit analysis, Equation (3.41) is a convenient deﬁnition of VTH because it ﬁts current–voltage curves.
If this deﬁnition is chosen instead of the charge-balance deﬁnition of Equation (3.32), then Equation (3.32)
and Equation (3.38) result in an approximation to fTH.
Driving Ability and ID,sat
The driving ability of the MOSFET is proportional to the current it can provide at a given gate bias. One might
anticipate that the larger this current, the faster the circuit. Here, this current is used to ﬁnd some response
times governing MOSFET circuits.
MOSFET current is dependent upon the carrier density in the channel or upon VG  VTH (see
Equation (3.41)). For a long-channel device, driving ability depends also on channel length. The shorter the
channel length, L, the greater the driving ability, because the channel resistance is directly proportional to the
channel length. Although it is an oversimpliﬁcation, let us suppose that the MOSFET is primarily in saturation
during the driving of its load. This simpliﬁcation will allow a clear discussion of the issues involved in making
faster MOSFETs without complicated mathematics. Assuming the MOSFET to be saturated over most of the
3-45
Transistors

switching period, driving ability is proportional to current in saturation, or to
ID;sat ¼ eoxZm
2dL ðVG  VTHÞ2
ð3:42Þ
where the factor of two results from the saturating behavior of the I–V curves at large drain biases and Z is the
width of the channel normal to the direction of current ﬂow. Evidently, for long devices driving ability is
quadratic in VG  VTH and inversely proportional to d.
The result of Equation (3.42) holds for long devices. For short-channel devices, as explained for Figure 3.44,
the larger ﬁelds exerted by the drain electrode cause velocity saturation and, as a result, ID,sat is given roughly by
(Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989)
ID;sat < eoxZusat
d
ðVG  VTHÞ2
VG  VTH þ FsatL
ð3:43Þ
where usat is the carrier saturation velocity, about 107 cm/sec for silicon at 290 K, Fsat is the ﬁeld at which
velocity saturation sets in, about 5 · 104 V/cm for electrons and not well established as * 105 V=cm for holes
in silicon MOSFETs. For Equation (3.43) to agree with Equation (3.42) at long L, we need m < 2usat=Fsat <
400 cm2=ðV·sÞ for electrons in silicon MOSFETs, which is only roughly correct. Nonetheless, we can see that
for devices in the submicron channel length regime, ID,sat tends to become independent of channel length L
and becomes more linear with VG  VTH, and less quadratic (see Figure 3.44). Equation (3.43) shows that
velocity saturation is signiﬁcant when VG=L5
, Fsat for example, when L & 0:5 mm if VG  VTH ¼ 2:5 V.
To relate ID,sat to a gate response time tG, consider one MOSFET driving an identical MOSFET as load
capacitance. Then the current from Equation (3.43) charges this capacitance to a voltage VG in a gate response
time tG given by (Shoji, 1988):
tG ¼ CGVG
ID;sat
¼ L

1 þ Cpar


 VGðVG  VTH þ FsatLÞ
ðVG  VTHÞ2
ð3:44Þ
where CG is the MOSFET gate capacitance CG ¼ Cox þ Cpar, with Cox¼ eoxZL=d the MOSFET oxide
capacitance, and Cpar the parasitic component of the gate capacitance (Chen, 1990). The parasitic capacitance
Cpar is due to overlap of the gate electrode over the source and drain, and to fringing-ﬁeld and channel-edge
capacitances. For short-channel lengths, Cpar is a signiﬁcant part of CG. Typically, VTH < VG=4, so:
tG ¼

ð3:45Þ
Thus, on an intrinsic level, the gate response time is closely related to the transit time of an electron from
source to drain, which is L=usat in velocity saturation. At shorter L, a linear reduction in delay with L is
predicted, while for longer devices the improvement can be quadratic in L, depending upon how VG is scaled
as L is reduced.
The gate response time is not the only delay in device switching, because the drain-body pn-junction also
must charge or discharge for the MOSFET to change state (Shoji, 1988). Hence, we must also consider a drain
response time tD. Following Equation (3.44), we suppose that the drain capacitance CD is charged by the
supply voltage through a MOSFET in saturation so that:
tD ¼ CDVG
ID;sat
¼ CD

ð3:46Þ

Equation (3.46) suggests that tD will show a similar improvement to tG as L is reduced, provided that CD/CG
does not increase as L is reduced. However, Cox ~ L=d, and the major component of Cpar, namely, the overlap
capacitance contribution, leads to Cpar~Lovlp=d where Lovlp is roughly three times the length of overlap of the
gate over the source or drain (Chen, 1990). Then CG ~ ðL þ LovlpÞ=d and, to keep the CD/CG ratio from
increasing as L is reduced, either CD or oxide-thickness d must be reduced along with L.
Clever design can reduce CD. For example, various raised-drain designs reduce the drain-to-body
capacitance by separating much of the drain area from the body using a thick oxide layer. The contribution to
drain capacitance stemming from the sidewall depletion-layer width next to the channel region is more
difﬁcult to handle because the sidewall depletion layer is deliberately reduced during miniaturization to avoid
short-channel effects, that is, drain inﬂuence upon the channel in competition with gate control. As a result this
sidewall contribution to the drain capacitance tends to increase with miniaturization unless junction depth
can be shrunk.
Equation (3.45) and Equation (3.46) predict reduction of response times by reduction in channel length L.
Decreasing oxide thickness leads to no improvement in tG, but Equation (3.46) shows a possibility of
improvement in tD because CD is independent of d while CG increases as d decreases. The ring oscillator, a
closed loop of an odd number of inverters, is a test circuit whose performance depends primarily on tG and tD.
Gate delay/stage for ring oscillators is found to be near 12 ps/stage at 0.1 mm channel length, and 60 ps/stage
at 0.5 mm channel length.
For circuits, interconnection capacitances and fan-out (multiple MOSFET loads) will increase response times
beyond the device response time, even when parasitics are taken into account. Thus, we are led to consider
interconnection
delay,
tINT.
Although
a

model
suggests,
as
with
Equation
(3.46),
that
tINT < ðCINT=CGÞtG, the length of interconnections requires a distributed model. Interconnection delay is then:
tINT ¼ RINTCINT

þ RINTCG þ 1 þ CINT
CG


tG
ð3:47Þ
where the new symbols are RINT ¼ interconnection resistance, CINT ¼ interconnection capacitance, and
we have assumed that the interconnection joins a MOSFET driver in saturation to a MOSFET load CG. For
small RINT, tINT is dominated by the last term, which resembles Equation (3.44) and Equation (3.46).
However, unlike the ratio CD/CG in Equation (3.46), it is difﬁcult to reduce or even maintain the ratio CINT/CG
in Equation (3.47) as L is reduced. Recall that CG ~ ZðLþLovlpÞ=d. Reduction of L therefore tends to increase
CINT/CG, especially because interconnect cross sections cannot be reduced without impractical increases in
RINT. What is worse, along with reduction in L, chip sizes usually increase, making line lengths longer,
increasing RINTeven at constant cross section. As a result, interconnection delay becomes a major problem as L
is reduced. The obvious way to keep CINT/CG under control is to increase the device width Z so that
CG ~ ZðLþLovlpÞ=d remains constant as L is reduced. A better way is to cascade drivers of increasing Z (Shoji,
1988; Chen, 1990). Either solution requires extra area, however, reducing the packing density that is a major
objective in decreasing L in the ﬁrst place. An alternative is to reduce the oxide thickness d.
Transconductance
Another important device parameter is the small-signal transconductance gm (Haznedar, 1991; Sedra and
Smith, 1991;), which determines the amount of output current swing at the drain that results from a
given input voltage variation at the gate, that is, the small-signal gain:
gm ¼ qID
qVG
VD¼const
ð3:48Þ
Using the chain rule of differentiation, the transconductance in saturation can be related to the small-signal
transition or unity-gain frequency, which determines at how high a frequency o the small-signal current
gain jiout=iinj ¼ gm=ðoCGÞ drops to unity. Using the chain rule:
3-47
Transistors

gm ¼ qID;sat

ð3:49Þ
where CG is the oxide capacitance of the device, CG ¼ qQG=qVGjVD with QG ¼ the charge on the
gate electrode. The frequency oT is a measure of the small-signal, high-frequency speed of the device,
neglecting parasitic resistances. Using Equation (3.43) in Equation (3.49) we ﬁnd that the transition frequency
also is related to the transit time L/usat of Equation (3.45), so that the digital and small-signal circuit speeds are
related to this parameter.
Output Resistance and Drain Conductance
For small-signal circuits the output resistance ro of the MOSFET (Sedra and Smith, 1991) is important in
limiting the gain of ampliﬁers. This resistance is related to the small-signal drain conductance gD in saturation
by
ro ¼ 1

ð3:51Þ
showing how gain is reduced if ro is reduced to a value approaching RL.
As devices are miniaturized, ro is decreased, gD increased, due to several factors. At moderate drain biases,
the main factor is channel-length modulation, the reduction of the channel length with increasing drain
voltage that results when the depletion region around the drain expands toward the source, causing L to
become drain-bias dependent. At larger drain biases, a second factor is drain control of the inversion-layer
charge density, which can compete with gate control in short devices. This is the same mechanism discussed
later in the context of subthreshold behavior. At rather high drain bias, carrier multiplication further lowers ro.
In a digital inverter, a lower ro widens the voltage swing needed to cause a transition in output voltage. This
widening increases power loss due to current spiking during the transition and reduces noise margins
(Annaratone, 1986). It is not, however, a ﬁrst-order concern in device miniaturization for digital applications.
Because small-signal circuits are more sensitive to ro than digital circuits, MOSFETs designed for small-signal
applications are not usually made as small as those for digital applications.
Limitations upon Miniaturization
A major factor in the success of the MOSFET has been its compatibility with processing useful down to very
small dimensions. In this section some of the limits that must be considered in miniaturization are outlined
(Brews, 1990).
It should be noted that scaling of MOSFET technology has continued at an aggressive pace for
approximately three decades and is projected to continue well into the future. Today channel lengths (source-
to-drain spacings) of 50 nm are manufacturable and further reduction to less than 15 nm is projected by 2015.
At each generation the limitations discussed in this section, as well as others, have been addressed with
innovative engineering solutions. These areas remain the subject of active research and the reader is referred to
the current literature, and the latest edition of International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors for the
most current information (Semiconductor Industry Association, 2003).

Subthreshold Control
When a MOSFET is in the ‘‘off’’ condition, that is, when the MOSFET is in subthreshold, the off current drawn
with the drain at supply voltage must not be too large in order to avoid power consumption and discharge of
ostensibly isolated nodes (Shoji, 1988). In small devices, however, the source and drain are closely spaced, so
there exists a danger of direct interaction of the drain with the source, rather than an interaction mediated by
the gate and channel. In an extreme case, the drain may draw current directly from the source, even though the
gate is off (punchthrough). A less extreme but also undesirable case occurs when the drain and gate jointly
control the carrier density in the channel (drain-induced barrier lowering, or drain control of threshold
voltage). In such a case, the on–off behavior of the MOSFET is not controlled by the gate alone and switching
can occur over a range of gate voltages dependent on the drain voltage. Reliable circuit design under these
circumstances is very complicated and testing for design errors is prohibitive. Hence, in designing MOSFETs, a
drain-bias independent subthreshold behavior is necessary.
A measure of the range of inﬂuence of the source and drain is the depletion-layer width of the associated
pn-junctions. The depletion layer of such a junction is the region in which all carriers have been depleted, or
pushed away, due to the potential drop across the junction. This potential drop includes the applied bias
across the junction and a spontaneous built-in potential drop induced by spontaneous charge exchange when
p and n regions are brought into contact. The depletion-layer width W of an abrupt junction is related to
potential drop V and dopant-ion concentration/unit volume N by:
W ¼
2eSV
qN

1=2
ð3:52Þ
To avoid subthreshold problems, a commonly used rule of thumb is to make sure that the channel length is
longer than a minimum length Lmin related to the junction depth rj, the oxide thickness d, and the depletion-
layer widths WS and WD of the source and drain, respectively, by (Brews, 1990):
Lmin ¼ A½rjdðWS þ WDÞ2	1=3
ð3:53Þ
where the empirical constant A ¼ 0.88 nm–1/3 if rj, WS, and WD are in micrometers and d is in nanometers.
Equation (3.53) shows that smaller devices require shallower junctions (smaller rj), thinner oxides (smaller
d), or smaller depletion-layer widths (smaller voltage levels or heavier doping). These requirements introduce
side effects that are difﬁcult to control. For example, if the oxide is made thinner while voltages are not reduced
proportionately, then oxide ﬁelds increase, requiring better oxides. If junction depths are reduced, better
control of processing is required and the junction resistance is increased due to smaller cross-sections.
To control this resistance, various self-aligned contact schemes have been developed to bring the source and
drain contacts closer to the gate (Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Brews, 1990), reducing the resistance of
these connections. If depletion-layer widths are reduced by increasing the dopant-ion density the driving
ability of the MOSFETsuffers because the threshold voltage increases. That is, QD increases in Equation (3.40),
reducing VG  VTH. Thus, for devices that are not velocity-saturated, that is, devices where VG=L5
, Fsat,
increasing VTH results in slower circuits.
As secondary consequences of increasing dopant-ion density, channel conductance is further reduced due to
the combined effects of increased scattering of electrons from the dopant atoms and increased oxide ﬁelds that
pin carriers in the inversion layer closer to the insulator–semiconductor interface, increasing scattering at the
interface. These effects also reduce driving ability, although for shorter devices they are important only in the
linear region (that is, below saturation), assuming that mobility m is more strongly affected than saturation
velocity usat.
Hot-Electron Effects
Another limit upon how small a MOSFET can be made is a direct result of the larger ﬁelds in small devices. Let
us digress to consider why proportionately larger voltages, and thus larger ﬁelds, are used in smaller devices.
3-49
Transistors

First, according to Equation (3.45), tG is shortened if voltages are increased, at least so long as VG=L5
, Fsat
5 · 104V/cm. If tG is shortened this way, then so are tD and tINT (Equation (3.46) and Equation (3.47)). Thus,
faster response is gained by increasing voltages into the velocity saturation region. Second, the control of
fabrication tolerances for smaller devices has not improved proportionately as L has shrunk, so there is a larger
percentage variation in device parameters with smaller devices. Thus, disproportionately larger voltages are
needed to ensure that all devices operate in the circuit to overcome this increased fabrication control ‘‘noise.’’
Thus, to increase speed and to cope with fabrication control variations, ﬁelds go up in smaller devices.
As a result of these larger ﬁelds along the channel direction, a small fraction of the channel carriers have
enough energy to enter the insulating layer near the drain. In silicon-based p-channel MOSFETs, energetic
holes can become trapped in the oxide, leading to a positive oxide charge near the drain that reduces the
strength of the channel, degrading device behavior. In n-channel MOSFETs, energetic electrons entering the
oxide create interface traps and oxide wear-out, eventually leading to gate-to-drain shorts (Pimbley et al.,
1989).
To cope with these problems ‘‘drain-engineering’’ has been tried, the most common solution being the
lightly doped drain (Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Pimbley et al., 1989; Chen, 1990). In this design, a lightly
doped extension of the drain is inserted between the channel and the drain proper. To keep the ﬁeld moderate
and reduce any peaks in the ﬁeld, the lightly doped drain extension is designed to spread the drain-to-channel
voltage drop as evenly as possible. The aim is to smooth out the ﬁeld at a value close to Fsat so that energetic
carriers are kept to a minimum. The expense of this solution is an increase in drain resistance and a decreased
gain. To increase packing density, this lightly doped drain extension can be stacked vertically alongside the
gate, rather than laterally under the gate, to control the overall device area.
Thin Oxides
According to Equation (3.53), thinner oxides allow shorter devices and therefore higher packing densities for
devices. In addition, driving ability is increased, shortening response times for capacitive loads, and output
resistance and transconductance are increased. There are some basic limitations upon how thin the oxide can
be made. For instance, there is a maximum oxide ﬁeld that the insulator can withstand. It is thought
that the intrinsic breakdown voltage of SiO2 is of the order of 107 V/cm, a ﬁeld that can support <2 · 1013
charges/cm2, a large enough value to make this ﬁeld limitation secondary. Of more serious concern are factors
such as defect density and precise control of oxide thickness.
Some improvement has been made in gate dielectric properties by adding nitrogen to silicon dioxide to
produce a nitrided silicon dioxide. This has the effect of improving breakdown and leakage characteristics,
reducing defect density, and somewhat increasing the dielectric constant of the gate insulator. Looking
forward, more exotic ‘‘high-k’’ materials are being considered for use as gate dielectrics which, by virtue of
higher dielectric constants, offer the promise of performance equivalent to thinner silicon dioxide with
physically thicker ﬁlms.
Dopant-Ion Control
As devices are made smaller, the precise positioning of dopant inside the device is critical. At high
temperatures during processing, dopant ions can move. For example, source and drain dopants can enter the
channel region, causing position dependence of threshold voltage. Similar problems occur in isolation
structures that separate one device from another (Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Pimbley et al., 1989; Wolf,
1995).
To control these thermal effects, process sequences are carefully designed to limit high-temperature steps.
This design effort is shortened and improved by the use of computer modeling of the processes. Dopant-ion
movement is complex, however, and its theory is made more difﬁcult by the growing trend to use rapid
thermal processing that involves short-time heat treatments. As a result, dopant response is not steady state, but
transient. Computer models of transient response are primitive, forcing further advances in small-device
design to be more empirical.
As device dimensions are further reduced, the possibility exists that the smallest of devices may have only of
the order of a few hundred or fewer dopant ions within the active channel region. This means that a variation
3-50
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

of dopant ions that is small in absolute number may imply a signiﬁcant difference in doping density between
otherwise identical devices. Under such conditions control of the statistical variation of device parameters is
extremely challenging.
Other Limitations
Besides limitations directly related to the MOSFET, there are some broader difﬁculties in using MOSFETs of
smaller dimension in chips involving even greater numbers of devices. Already mentioned is the increased
delay due to interconnections that are lengthening due to increasing chip area and increasing complexity of
connection. The capacitive loading of MOSFETs that must drive signals down these lines can slow circuit
response, requiring extra circuitry to compensate. Another limitation is the need to isolate devices from each
other (Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Pimbley et al., 1989; Brews, 1990; Chen, 1990; Wolf, 1995), so their
actions remain uncoupled by parasitics. One method to address device isolation at decreasing dimensions is
shallow-trench isolation, which has been developed to replace local oxidation isolation methods. As isolation
structures are reduced in size to increase device densities, new parasitics are discovered. A developing solution
to this problem is the manufacture of circuits on insulating substrates, silicon-on-insulator technology
(Colinge, 1991).
Deﬁning Terms
Channel:
The conducting region in a MOSFET between source and drain. In an enhancement-mode (or
normally off) MOSFET, the channel is an inversion layer formed by attraction of minority carriers
toward the gate. These carriers form a thin conducting layer that is prevented from reaching the gate by
a thin gate-oxide isulating layer when the gate bias exceeds threshold. In a buried-channel, or depletion-
mode (or normally on) MOSFET, the channel is present even at zero gate bias, and the gate serves to
increase the channel resistance when its bias is nonzero. Thus, this device is based on majority-carrier
modulation, like a MESFET.
Gate:
The control electrode of a MOSFET. The voltage on the gate capacitively modulates the resistance of
the connecting channel between the source and drain.
Source, drain:
The two output contacts of a MOSFET, usually formed as pn-junctions with the substrate or
body of the device.
Strong inversion:
The range of gate biases corresponding to the ‘‘on’’ condition of the MOSFET. At a ﬁxed
gate bias in this region, for low drain-to-source biases the MOSFET behaves as a simple gate-controlled
resistor. At larger drain biases, the channel resistance can increase with drain bias, even to the point that
the current saturates, or becomes independent of drain bias.
Substrate or body:
The portion of the MOSFET that lies between the source and drain, and under the gate.
The gate is separated from the body by a thin gate insulator, usually silicon dioxide. The gate modulates
the conductivity of the body, providing a gate-controlled resistance between the source and drain. The
body is sometimes dc-biased to adjust overall circuit operation. In some circuits the body voltage can
swing up and down as a result of input signals, leading to ‘‘body-effect’’ or ‘‘back-gate bias’’ effects that
must be controlled for reliable circuit response.
Subthreshold:
The range of gate biases corresponding to the ‘‘off’’ condition of the MOSFET. In this
regime the MOSFET is not perfectly ‘‘off’’ but conducts a leakage current that must be controlled to
avoid circuit errors and power consumption.
Threshold:
The gate bias of a MOSFET that marks the boundary between ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ conditions.

Single-Electron Transistors
James E. Morris
Moore’s Law has been used for many years to predict the eventual demise of complementary metal-oxide-
semiconductor (CMOS) technology [1] as shrinking devices either become too small to function or too small
to make. As MOS gate thicknesses shrink, electron tunneling and leakage currents due to electron tunneling
increase, forcing the development of high dielectric constant materials to restore gate thickness. The end of
functional optical lithography [2] was expected when device dimensions reached optical wavelengths, but was
averted by high-tech tricks like phase contrast masking. The industry has proved most inventive in delaying
the end, but eventually a new technology is still expected to take over. Single-electron devices, conceptually
similar to MOS devices, provide one possible solution. The key requirements for the adoption of any of the
competing successor technologies will be size, speed, and price, with competitive pricing requiring parallel
manufacturing techniques.
One of the most exciting recent developments in microelectronics has been the development of single-
electron transistor (SET) logic devices from the basic concept of the two-terminal Coulomb block/blockade
(CB). The CB consists of a small (metal) quantum dot separated from source and drain electrodes by
tunneling junctions. The SET structure adds a gate electrode. In the CB, current cannot ﬂow until the metal
dot of radius r is charged, which requires energy:
DE > q2=4per
ð3:54Þ
in a medium of dielectric constant e, where q is the electronic charge. At absolute zero, the applied ﬁeld
provides the electrostatic energy, i.e., V > DE=q for current to ﬂow. The fundamental SET idea is that the
charge can be placed on the island by a third, gate-control electrode, permitting the ﬂow of low voltage ‘‘on’’
current. This section develops the basic principle of operation of the SET in terms of electron tunneling and
electrostatic charging of quantum dot capacitances, the CB, and the ‘‘electron box.’’ SET operation is
considered in terms of stability and thermal effects, and the latter’s effect on practical device design. The
section concludes with a discussion of fabrication issues.
Electron Tunneling
CB and SET operation is based on electron tunneling between the quantum-dot island and the electrodes.
Figure 3.45(a) contrasts the normal thermionic emission (TE) process over the potential barrier through the
conduction band of the insulator with electron tunneling (ET) through it. The tunneling transition rate
depends upon the product of the probability F1ðEÞ that electron states at the electron energy level E are
occupied in the source electrode and the probability ½1  F2ðEÞ	 that the receiving electrode’s energy states are
empty, i.e., the net electron transfer rate T1!2  T2!1 is proportional to:
D12ðE1ÞF1ðE1Þ½1  F2ðE2Þ	  D21ðE2ÞF2ðE2Þ½1  F1ðE1Þ	
¼ D12ðE1ÞF1ðE1Þ  D21ðE2ÞF2ðE2Þ
ð3:55Þ
where E2 ¼ E1 þ qV at bias V, and Di2 is the tunneling probability from 1 to 2. For tunneling, the transition
probability is exponentially dependent on the barrier width, s, and height, F0 (which equals the work function
in vacuum). For a rectangular barrier (e.g., in Figure 3.45(a)) the zero-ﬁeld probability is [3]:

where z ¼ ð2p=hÞ½2mðF0  EÞ	1=2, h is Planck’s constant, and m is the electron mass, which reduces to

if F0 , 2E and zs .. 0. The more realistic barrier shape is parabolic (Figure 3.45(b)) due to image charge
effects [4], and the WKB approximation gives the similar result [3]:

Electrostatic Charging Energy
The metal–insulator–metal system described above also forms a capacitor, and the transfer of an electron by
tunneling changes the system energy by
DE ¼ q2=2C
ð3:58Þ
where C ¼ eA=s for a parallel plate capacitor of plate area A. If one of these ‘‘plates’’ is actually a co-planar
electrode, and the other a small sphere of radius r, the charging energy and capacitance can be estimated as the
classical results for a spherically symmetric system, i.e., (more completely than in Equation (3.54)), [5]:
DE ¼ ðq2=4peÞðr1  ðr þ sÞ1Þ
ð3:59Þ
or
C ¼ 2perð1 þ r=sÞ
ð3:60Þ
This energy becomes signiﬁcant, i.e., DE .. kT, where T is the absolute temperature, as the island dimension
decreases. DE is plotted as a function of island size in Figure 3.46, for the cases of er ¼ 1, 2, 4 and s ¼ 1, 2, 5
nm, and 1. The thermal energy is also indicated for T ¼ 4, 77, and 300 K.
FIGURE 3.46

three clusters of lines correspond to er values, with er¼1 at the top, and within each cluster, the four lines correspond to s
values, with s ¼ 1 nm at the bottom.
3-55
Transistors

The number N of an array of N1 identical islands that are randomly charged by thermal energy at T is given
by the Boltzmann distribution
N ¼ N1 expðDE=kTÞ
ð3:61Þ
Conversely, an individual island would be randomly charged a similar proportion of the time. In practice the
islands will not be spherical, and DE requires further modiﬁcation [6].
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle requires that
DE·Dt > h
ð3:62Þ
For DE ¼ q2=2C and Dt ¼ RtC, where Rt is the effective tunneling resistance, this gives:
Rt > 2h=q2
ð3:63Þ
i.e., the tunneling resistance must be greater than the ‘‘quantum resistance’’ of around 52 kO in order
for the charge to be considered as localized on the quantum dot [7]. (Lower values permit ‘‘co-tunneling,’’ i.e.,
an electron tunnels off the island at the same time as one tunnels on, maintaining charge neutrality of the
island.)
Coulomb Block
The charging of the small island requires energy, and at absolute zero, with electrons conﬁned to the Fermi
level and below, electron tunneling to the island cannot occur (Figure 3.47) until voltage Vds > 2ðDE=2qÞ, as
shown in Figure 3.48(b). For island charge Q ¼ Qs  Qd:
Vs ¼ ðCdVds þ QÞ=ðCs þ CdÞ

Vd ¼ ðCsVds  QÞ=ðCs þ CdÞ

and for identical tunnel junctions Cs ¼ Cd ¼ C=2, so the bias is equally distributed for Q ¼ 0. Once an excess
electron is resident on the island, it raises the Fermi level by DE, and it can clearly tunnel on to the second
electrode without energy constraint, (Figure 3.48(c)), i.e., a current ﬂows. The low T current–voltage (I–V)
characteristic of the CB is shown in Figure 3.48(d).
At ﬁnite temperatures, random thermal charging effects will lead to ﬁnite subthreshold currents. As Vds
increases, DE is reduced by the ﬁeld, and the current increases as the thermal charging probability increases.
Single-Electron Box
The single-electron box (Figure 3.49) looks similar to the CB, but one of the gaps is sufﬁciently thick to
preclude the possibility of tunneling, i.e., there is one tunnel junction and one capacitor to the structure. The
application of sufﬁcient voltage again induces charging of the island when the tunnel junction voltage, VXS,
exceeds DE=q, i.e., when Vgs exceeds ð1 þ Cs=CgÞDE=q (Figure 3.50(a)). For Cg ,, Cs, almost all Vgs appears
across the capacitor, and the electron transfer takes place when Vgs > q2=2C < q2=2Cg. However, unlike the
CB case, once the island is charged, the electron cannot tunnel on through the capacitor to discharge it. The
‘‘stability’’ diagram for multiple-electron charging is shown in Figure 3.50(b).

Current can ﬂow if Vs or Vd exceeds Q=2C where C ¼ Cd þ Cs þ Cg for any Q ¼ nq. This gives rise to the
stability diagram of Figure 3.52, where current can ﬂow for conditions deﬁned as outside the n-periodic
diamond shapes in Figure 3.52(a), as shown in Figure 3.52(b) for the application of ﬁnite Vds [8].
Thermal Effects
An example of a basic SET structure is shown in Figure 3.53. The source and drain electrodes are shown
at high magniﬁcation, where random islands are seen as white dots. The lower magniﬁcation picture
shows the gate conﬁguration. The 77 K characteristics shown in Figure 3.54 are actually for a different but
very similar device. The thermal charging effects are evident, as is the turn-on threshold somewhere
between 0.5 V , Vt , 1.0 V. To minimize thermal charging effects, the charging capacitance needs to go
down, either by achieving smaller island sizes, or by using a series combination of islands (so Cseries ¼
Cislands=n for n islands), or both.
The series chain of islands has been used by Yano et al. in the fabrication of room-temperature
memory circuits [10]. The islands are established on silicon crystals in a polycrystalline ﬁlm thinned to
widen grain boundaries. In similar 2D island arrays of discontinuous metal thin ﬁlms (DTF), it has been
shown that dc (i.e., on-state) conduction requires the establishment of space charge distribution,
speciﬁcally with negatively charged islands at the positive electrode [11]. This space distribution takes
ﬁnite time to establish, and the simple SET concept may require a high-frequency refresh mode of
operation.

DTF electrical conductance may be expressed as
s ¼ s0 expðDE=kTÞ;
ð3:68Þ
where DE is also the electrostatic charging energy of the metal islands. At ﬁnite T, the thermal energy and
applied ﬁeld, F, both contribute to island charging, and the form of DE needs further consideration. In a
treatment that exactly parallels Schottky effect theory (Figure 3.55) [12]:

which is the standard CB result. The nonlinear subthreshold CB characteristics of kT·logðs=s0Þ should follow

Fabrication
The basic concept has evolved in many different directions. One approach has been to adopt silicon processing
technology, and this has led to a number of modiﬁed conﬁgurations [13] that look little like the conceptual
device described here and shown above (Figure 3.53). Here, gold islands have been deposited upon pre-
deposited, etched gold electrodes on SiO2. The electrode capture distance provides some consistency to
structures obtained with this approach, but an alternative approach to deﬁning regular stable structures in an
atomic force microscope (AFM) is under development (Figure 3.56). In this approach, Cr ions are deposited
on the insulating substrate by ﬁeld emission from the AFT tip. The Cr forms stable bonding nuclei for the
subsequent deposition of gold (or other noble metal) islands and electrodes. The AFM can also be used to
deﬁne SET patterns by ﬁeld oxidation of metal thin ﬁlms [14–16]. The AFM technique is clearly unsuitable for
wide area parallel device fabrication, but may be useful to deﬁne initial structures for subsequent imprint
processing of polymers. In all cases, the real challenge is to develop interconnect technologies on a scale to
match the SET dimensions.
Circuits
One of the simplest circuits is the inverter shown in Figure 3.57, which clearly shows some conceptual
similarity to the CMOS inverter. An estimate of the high-frequency performance of SET circuits can be
obtained from the RC product of the minimum tunneling resistance (the quantum resistance of, say, 50 KO
(Equation (3.63)), and the SET capacitance [17] of around 0.1 aF from Equation (3.60) for r ¼ s ¼ 1 nm,
er ¼ 1. These ﬁgures suggest an upper limit of 30 THz. With such high potential for device performance, the
limiting factor for circuit speed will be the interconnect technology (and background charge effects which have
been ignored in this idealized introduction).

Moore’s law:
Notes that integrated circuit (IC) component density doubles about every 18 months.
However, the title is used generically for a wide variety of related linear semi-log plots of IC parameters
vs. time, e.g., device size, number of transistors per chip, etc.
Electron tunneling:
A quantum-mechanical effect which enables electrons to pass through a sufﬁciently
thin insulating layer separating two conductors. It comes from the wave nature of the electron in a
crystal lattice. Where E5F0, the solution to the wave equation becomes an exponentially decaying
function which may be nonzero on the other side of a very thin barrier. When the electron is positioned
in the barrier, image charges in the electrodes, and images of the images, exert forces on the electron,
much as for the Schottky effect referred to above. The net effect of the image charge effect is to reduce
the barrier height, and convert the rectangular barrier to a parabolic shape. With the barrier slope
changing sufﬁciently with the parabolic shape, the WKB approximation can be employed to calculate
a more realistic electron transmission probability than for the rectangular barrier.
Quantum dots:
Nanoparticles of metal or semiconductor which display quantum(-mechanical) effects,
such as quantized electron energy levels, due to the small size.
The electrons in a metal with energy greater than the work function of the material may be emitted
from the surface by thermionic emission. The Schottky effect lowers the effective work function by
the application of an electric ﬁeld.
When an atom is adsorbed on a substrate, it dissipates thermal energy by moving about the surface. In
this process, it may be captured by a preexisting condensate island, electrode, etc., if it was deposited
within the characteristic capture distance of such an entity.

There are now a great many books on the broad ﬁeld of Nanotechnology, and SETs appear in many of these,
but a good place to start is with Ref. [7] or [18]. Other review articles found useful in the preparation of this
chapter include Refs. [19, 20]. Some alternative device conﬁgurations can be found in Refs. [7, 13, 19, 21] and
circuits in Refs. [13, 21], with a range of future application proposals in Ref. [19]. DTF background can be
found in Refs. [22, 23]. For new developments, there will be a rapidly expanding range of magazines and
journals covering or touching upon nanotechnology in general. The IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology
seems to carry a couple of SET papers in each issue, and Nanotechnology (Institute of Physics) is also proving

Integrated Circuit Technology
Joe E. Brewer
Integrated circuit technology, the cornerstone of the modern electronics industry, is subject to rapid change.
Electronic engineers, especially those engaged in research and development, can beneﬁt from an under-
standing of the structure and pattern of growth of this technology.
Technology Perspective
A solid-state integrated circuit (IC) is a group of interconnected circuit elements formed on or within a
continuous substrate. While an integrated circuit may be based on many different material systems, silicon is
by far the dominant material. For quite a number of years, about 98% of contemporary electronic devices were
based on silicon technology, and about 85% of those silicon integrated circuits were complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices. In recent years, the use of nonsilicon integrated circuits such as Ga–As,
and silicon variants such as Si–Ge, has increased because of proliferation of communications-oriented
applications. It is also expected that the nature of the classical CMOS-type circuits will be changing to
incorporate new materials and geometric structures.
From an economic standpoint the most important metric for an IC is the ‘‘level of functional integration.’’
The accepted way to measure functional integration is by component count such as the number of transistors
4-1

per chip or the number of bits per chip, but other measures such as million instructions per second (MIPS) or
million ﬂoating point operations per second (MFLOPS) can also be used. Since the invention of the IC by Jack
Kilby in 1958, the level of integration has steadily increased. The pleasant result is that cost and physical size
per function reduce continuously, and we enjoy a ﬂow of new affordable information processing products that
pervade all aspects of our day-to-day lives.
The approximate historical rate of increase was a doubling of functional content per chip every 18 months.
The related resulting historical experience has been a cost reduction per function of ,25% per year combined
with a growth in the market for integrated circuits of ,17% per year. Because of increased difﬁculty in scaling
devices these trends are slowing and it is expected that functional content per chip will increase at about half
the historical rate.
For engineers who work with products that use semiconductor devices, the challenge is to anticipate and
make use of these enhanced capabilities in a timely manner. It is not an overstatement to say that survival in
the marketplace depends on rapid ‘‘design-in’’ and deployment.
For engineers who work in the semiconductor industry, or its myriad supporting industries, the challenge is
to maintain this relentless exponential growth. The entire industry is marching to a drum beat. The cost of
technology development and the investment in plant and equipment has risen to billions of dollars.
Companies that lag behind face serious loss of market share, and possibly dire economic consequences.
Technology Generations
The concept of a technology generation emerged from analysis of historical records, and was outlined by
Gordon Moore in the 1960s and captured as Moore’s law. This was an observation that circuit complexity per
chip was doubling at approximately equal time intervals. For quite a while the simple rule of thumb was that
succeeding generations would support a four times increase in circuit complexity, and new generations emerge
on an approximate 3-year interval. The associated observations are that linear dimensions of device features
change by a factor of 0.7, and the economically viable die area grows by a factor of 1.6. While technology
generations are still being deﬁned as having a 0.7 reduction in linear dimensions, succeeding generations no
longer support a 4 · complexity increase.
Minimum feature size stated in nanometers is the term used most frequently to label a technology
generation. ‘‘Feature’’ refers to a geometric object in the mask set such as a line width or a gate length. The
‘‘minimum feature’’ is the smallest dimension that can be reliably used to form the entity. Examples of
features might be the width of a metal or polysilicon line or the space between those lines. To establish a
numeric measure of the capability of a given technology it is common practice to use the half pitch of
critical metal lines. The pitch is the sum of the width of a line and the width of the space to an adjacent
line. The ‘‘half’’ pitch is, of course, one half of that sum. The minimum feature used to deﬁne a technology
generation (also referred to as a technology node) is the half pitch of metal lines in a dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) array. In recent years the metal one level half pitch for a microprocessor unit
(MPU) has rivaled the aggressiveness of the DRAM half pitch, and it is sometimes also used to specify the
node.
Figure 4.1 displays the technology evolution sequence. In the diagram, succeeding generations are numbered
using the current generation as the ‘‘zero’’ reference. Because this material was written in 2004, the ‘‘zero’’
generation is the 90-nm minimum feature size technology that began volume production in 2004.

An individual device generation has been observed to have a reasonably well-deﬁned life cycle that covers
about 17 years. The ﬁrst year of volume manufacture is the reference point for a generation, but its lifetime
actually extends further in both directions. As shown in Figure 4.2, one can think of the stages of maturity as
ranging over a linear scale that measures years to production in both the plus and minus directions.
The 17-year life cycle of a single generation, with new generations being introduced at 3-year intervals,
means that at any given time up to six generations are being worked on. This tends to blur the signiﬁcance of
research news and company announcements unless the reader is sensitive to the technology overlap in time.
To visualize this situation, consider Figure 4.3. The top row lists calendar years. The second row shows how
the life cycle of the 90-nm generation relates to the calendar. The third row shows the life cycle of the 65-nm
generation versus the calendar. Looking down any column corresponding to a speciﬁc calendar year, one can
see which generations are active and identify their respective life-cycle year.
One should not interpret the 17-year life cycle as meaning that no work is being performed that is relevant
to a generation before the 17-year period begins. For example, many organizations are currently (2004)
conducting experiments directed at transistors with gate lengths smaller than 15 nm. This author’s
interpretation is that when basic research efforts have explored technology boundaries, the conditions are
ripe for a speciﬁc generation to begin to coalesce as a unique entity. When a body of research begins to
seek compatible materials and processes to enable design and production at the target feature size, the
generation life cycle begins. This is a rather diffused activity at ﬁrst, and it becomes more focused as the
cycle proceeds.
International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
The recurring great expense of the research and development necessary to establish the new capabilities
and physical plant to produce devices at exponentially reduced feature sizes at 3-year intervals is more than a
single manufacturer (or country for that matter) can afford. In order to manage at least some of these costs,
manufacturers around the world have banded together to formulate a common roadmap that identiﬁes
the technical requirements for ﬁve or six technology generations—about a 15-year time horizon.

The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) is sponsored by industry groups from
Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.
Development of the ITRS is an ongoing activity that involves almost 1000 technical experts, who treat every
aspect of the complex device geometry and materials deﬁnition, fabrication processes and tooling, circuit
design and design tooling, test and assembly, and all of the supporting disciplines. Current practice is to
prepare a new version of the roadmap during odd-numbered years, and prepare only critical updates during
even-numbered years. In 2003 a complete roadmap was released and is available to the public over the Internet
at http://public.itrs.net.

The starting assumption of the ITRS is that a 0.7 · reduction of the minimum feature size will continue to
deﬁne technology nodes. The overall roadmap is comprised of many individual roadmaps that address
deﬁned critical areas of semiconductor research, development, engineering, and manufacturing. In each area,
needs and potential solutions for each technology generation are reviewed. Of course, this process is more
deﬁnitive for the early generations because knowledge is more complete and the range of alternatives is
restricted.
Table 4.1 presents some highlights of the 90 to 22 nm technology nodes extracted from various tables within
the 2003 ITRS. This brief summary shows trends across the generations, but the reader should consult the
actual ITRS for full explanations of the basis for the individual parameters.

Layout, Placement, and Routing
Mehdi R. Zargham and Spyros Tragoudas
Very large scale integrated (VLSI) electronics present a challenge, not only to those involved in the
development of fabrication technology, but also to computer scientists, computer engineers, and electrical
engineers. The ways in which digital systems are structured, the procedures used to design them, the trade-offs
between hardware and software, and the design of computational algorithms will all be greatly affected by the
coming changes in integrated electronics.
A VLSI chip can today contain hundreds of millions of transistors. One of the main factors contributing to
this increase is the effort that has been invested in the development of computer-aided design (CAD) systems
for VLSI design. The VLSI CAD systems are able to simplify the design process by hiding the low-level circuit
theory and device physics details from the designer, and allowing him or her to concentrate on the
functionality of the design and on ways of optimizing it.
A VLSI CAD system supports descriptions of hardware at many levels of abstraction, such as system,
subsystem, register, gate, circuit, and layout levels. It allows designers to design a hardware device at an
abstract level and progressively work down to the layout level. A layout is a complete geometric representa-
tion (a set of rectangles) from which the latest fabrication technologies directly produce reliable working
chips. A VLSI CAD system also supports veriﬁcation, synthesis, and testing of the design. Using a CAD
system, the designer can make sure that all of the parts work before actually implementing the design.
A variety of VLSI CAD systems are commercially available that perform all or some of the levels of
abstraction of design. Most of these systems support a layout editor for designing a circuit layout. A layout
editor is software that provides commands for drawing lines and boxes, copying objects, moving objects,
erasing unwanted objects, and so on. The output of such an editor is a design ﬁle that describes the layout.
Usually, the design ﬁle is represented in a standard format, called Caltech Intermediate Form (CIF), which is
accepted by the fabrication industry.
What Is Layout?
For a speciﬁc circuit, a layout speciﬁes the position and dimension of the different layers of materials as they
would be laid on the silicon wafer. However, the layout description is only a symbolic representation, which
simpliﬁes the description of the actual fabrication process. For example, the layout representation does not
explicitly indicate the thickness of the layers, thickness of oxide coating, amount of ionization in the
4-5
Integrated Circuits

transistors channels, etc., but these factors are implicitly understood in the fabrication process. Some of
the main layers used in any layout description are n-diffusion, p-diffusion, poly, metal-1, and metal-2. Each of
these layers is represented by a polygon of a particular color or pattern. As an example, Figure 4.4 presents a
speciﬁc pattern for each layer that will be used throughout the rest of this section.
As is shown in Figure 4.5, an n-diffusion layer crossing a poly layer implies an nMOS transistor, and a
p-diffusion crossing poly implies a pMOS transistor.
Note that the widths of diffusion and poly are represented with a scalable parameter called lambda. These
measurements, referred to as design rules, are introduced to prevent errors on the chip, such as preventing thin
lines from opening (disconnecting) and short-circuiting.
Implementing the design rules based on lambda makes the design process independent of the fabrication
process. This allows the design to be rescaled as the fabrication process improves.
Metal layers are used as wires for connections between the components. This is because metal has the lowest
propagation delay compared to the other layers. However, sometimes a poly layer is also used for short wires in
order to reduce the complexity of the wire routing. Any wire can cross another wire without being electrically
affected as long as they are in different layers. Two different layers can be electrically connected together using
contacts. The fabrication process of the contacts depends on the types of layers that are to be connected.
Therefore, a layout editor supports different types of contacts by using different patterns.
From the circuit layout, the actual chip is fabricated. Based on the layers in the layout, various layers of
materials, one on top of the others, are laid down on a silicon wafer. Typically, the process of laying down each
of these materials involves several steps, such as masking, oxide coating, lithography, and etching (Mead and
Conway, 1980). For example, as shown in Figure 4.6(a), for fabricating an nMOS transistor, ﬁrst, two masks,
one for poly and one for n-diffusion, are obtained from the circuit layout. Next, the n-diffusion mask is used
FIGURE 4.4
Different layers.
FIGURE 4.5
Layout and fabrication of MOS transistors.

to create a layer of silicon oxide on the wafer (see Figure 4.6(b)). The wafer will be covered with a thin layer of
oxide in places where the transistors are supposed to be placed as opposed to a thick layer in other places. The
poly mask is used to place a layer of polysilicon on top of the oxide layer to deﬁne the gate terminals of the
transistor (see Figure 4.6(c)). Finally, the n-diffusion regions are made to form the source and drain terminals
of the transistor (see Figure 4.6(d)).
To better illustrate the concept of layout design, the design of an inverter in CMOS technology is shown in
Figure 4.7. An inverter produces an output voltage that is the logical inverse of its input. Considering the circuit
diagram of Figure 4.7(a), when the input is one, the lower nMOS is on, but the upper pMOS is off. Thus, the
output becomes zero by becoming connected to the ground through the nMOS. However, if the input is zero, the
pMOS is on and the nMOS is off, so the output must ﬁnd a charge-up path through the pMOS to the supply and
therefore becomes one. Figure 4.7(b) represents a layout for such an inverter. As can be seen from this ﬁgure, the
problem of a layout design is essentially reduced to drawing and painting a set of polygons. Layout editors provide
commands for drawing such polygons. The commands are usually entered at the keyboard or with a mouse and,
in some menu-driven packages, can be selected as options from a pull-down menu.
In addition to the drawing commands, often a layout system provides tools for minimizing the overall area
of the layout (i.e., size of the chip). Today, a VLSI chip consists of many individual cells, with each one laid out
separately. A cell can be an inverter, a NAND gate, a multiplier, a memory unit, etc. The designer can make the
layout of a cell and then store it in a ﬁle called the cell library. Later, each time the designer wants to design a
circuit that requires the stored cell, he or she simply copies the layout from the cell library. A layout may
consist of many cells. Most of the layout systems provide routines, called ﬂoor planning, placement, and
routing routines for placing the cells and then interconnecting them with wires in such a way to minimize the
layout area. As an example, Figure 4.8 presents the placement of three cells. The area between the cells is used
for routing. We can also route above placed cells. This is called over the cell (OTC) routing. The entire routing
surface is divided into a set of rectangular routing areas called channels. The sides of each channel consist of a
set of terminals. A wire that connects the terminals with the same ID is called a net. The router ﬁnds a location
FIGURE 4.6

for the wire segments of each net within the channel. The following sections classify various types of placement
and routing techniques and provide an overview of the main steps of some of these techniques.
Floor Planning Techniques
The ﬂoor planning problem in computer-aided design of integrated circuits is similar to that in architecture
and the goal is to ﬁnd a location for each cell based on proximity (layout adjacency) criteria to other cells. We
consider rectangular ﬂoor plans whose boundaries are rectangles. It is desirable to obtain a ﬂoor plan that
minimizes the overall area of the layout.
An important goal in ﬂoor planning is the cell sizing problem where the goal is to determine the dimensions
of variable cells whose area is invariant. All cells are assumed to be rectangular, and in the cell sizing problem
the goal is to determine the width and height of each cell subject to predetermined upper and lower bounds on
their ratio, and to their product being equal to its area, so that the ﬁnal ﬂoor plan has optimal area.
One of the early approaches in ﬂoor planning is the hierarchical, where recursive bipartition or partition
into more than two parts is recursively employed and a ﬂoor plan tree is constructed. The tree simply reﬂects
the hierarchical construction of the ﬂoor plan. Figure 4.9 shows a hierarchical ﬂoor plan and its associated
tree. The partitioning problem and related algorithms are discussed extensively later in this section.

Many early hierarchical ﬂoor planning tools insist that the ﬂoor plan be sliceable. A sliceable ﬂoor plan is
recursively deﬁned as follows: (a) a cell or (b) a ﬂoor plan that can be bipartitioned into two sliceable ﬂoor
plans with either a horizontal or vertical line. Figure 4.10 shows a sliceable ﬂoor plan whose tree is binary.
Many tools that produce sliceable ﬂoor plans are still in use because of their simplicity. In particular, many
problems arising in sliceable ﬂoor planning are solvable optimally in polynomial time (Sarrafzadeh and Wong,
1996). Unfortunately, sliceable ﬂoor plans are rarely optimal (in terms of their areas), and they often result in
layouts with very difﬁcult routing phases. (Routing is discussed later in this section.) Figure 4.11 shows a
compact ﬂoor plan that is not sliceable.
Hierarchical tools that produce nonsliceable ﬂoor plans have also been proposed (Sarrafzadeh and Wong,
1996). The major problem in the development of such tools is that we are often facing problems that are
intractable and thus we have to rely on heuristics in order to obtain fast solutions. For example, the cell sizing
problem can be tackled optimally in sliceable ﬂoor plans (Otten, 1983; Stockmeyer, 1983) but the problem is
intractable for general nonsliceable ﬂoor plans.
A second approach to ﬂoor planning is the rectangular dual graph. The idea here is to use duality arguments
and express the cell adjacency constraints in terms of a graph, and then use an algorithm to translate the graph
into a rectangular ﬂoor plan. A rectangular dual graph of a rectangular ﬂoor plan is a planar graph G ¼ (V,E),
where V is the set of cells and E is the set of edges, and an edge (C1,C2) is in E if and only if cells C1 and C2 are
adjacent in the ﬂoor plan. See Figure 4.12 for a rectangular ﬂoor plan and its rectangular dual graph G.
Let us assume that the ﬂoor plan does not contain cross junctions. Figure 4.13 shows a cross junction. This
restriction does not signiﬁcantly increase the area of a ﬂoor plan because, as Figure 4.13 shows, a cross
junction can be replaced by two T junctions by simply adding a short edge e.
It has been shown that in the absence of cross junctions, the dual graph is planar triangulated (PT) and every
T-junction corresponds to a triangulated face of the dual PT graph. Unfortunately, not all PT graphs have a
rectangular ﬂoor plan. For example, in the graph of Figure 4.14 we cannot satisfy the adjacency requirements of
edges (a,b), (b,c), and (c,a) at the same time. Note that the later edges form a cycle of length 3 that is not a face.
It has been shown that a PT graph has a rectangular ﬂoor plan if and only if it does not contain such cycles of
length 3. Moreover, a linear time algorithm to obtain such a ﬂoor plan has been presented (Sarrafzadeh and
Wong, 1996). The rectangular dual graph approach is a new method for ﬂoor planning, and many ﬂoor
planning problems, such as the sizing problem, have not been tackled yet.

‘‘j’’ indicates a vertical slicing. The internal node labeled with ‘‘—’’ indicates a horizontal slicing.

Integrated Circuits

Rectangular ﬂoor plans can be obtained using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Both techniques
are used to solve general optimization problems for which the solution space is not well understood. The
approaches are easy to implement, but the algorithms have many parameters that require empirical
adjustments, and the results are usually unpredictable.
A ﬁnal approach to ﬂoor planning, which unfortunately requires substantial computational resources and
results to an intractable problem, is to formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (LP).
Consider the following deﬁnitions:
Wi, Hi, Ri: width, height, and area of cell Ci
Xi, Yi: coordinates of lower left corner of cell Ci
X, Y: the width and height of the ﬁnal ﬂoor plan
Ai, Bi: lower and upper bound for the ratio Wi/Hi of cell Ci
Pij, Qij: variables that take zero/one values for each pair of cells Ci and Cj
FIGURE 4.12

The goal is to ﬁnd Xi, Yi, Wi, and Hi for each cell so that all constraints are satisﬁed and XY is minimized.
The latter is a nonlinear constraint. However, we can ﬁx the width W and minimize the height of the ﬂoor plan
as follows:
min Y
XiþWi#W
Y$YiþHi
The complete mixed-integer LP formulation is (Sutanthavibul et al., 1991):
min Y
Xi,Yi,Wi$0
Pij,Qij ¼ 0 or 1
XiþWi#W
Y$YiþHi
XiþWi#XjþW(PijþQij)
XjþWj#XiþW(1PijþQij)
YiþHi#YjþH(1þPijQij)
YjþHj#YiþH(2PijQij)
When Hi appears in the above equations, it must be replaced (using ﬁrst-order approximation techniques)
by Hi ¼ DiWiþEi, where Di and Ei are deﬁned below:
Wmin ¼ (RiAi)1/2
Wmax ¼ (RiBi)1/2
Hmin ¼ (Ri/Bi)1/2
Hmax ¼ (Ri/Ai)1/2
Di ¼ Hmax – Hmin)/(Wmin – Wmax)
Ei ¼ Hmax – DiWmin
The unknown variables are Xi, Yi, Wi, Pij, and Qij. All other variables are known. The equations can then be
fed into an LP solver to ﬁnd a minimum cost solution for the unknowns.
Placement Techniques
Placement is a restricted version of ﬂoor planning where all cells have ﬁxed dimension. The objective of a
placement routine is to determine an optimal position on the chip for a set of cells in a way that the total
occupied area and total estimated length of connections are minimized. Given that the main cause of delay in a
chip is the length of the connections, providing shorter connections becomes an important objective in placing
a set of cells. The placement should be such that no cells overlap and enough space is left to complete all the
connections.
All exact methods known for determining an optimal solution require a computing effort that increases
exponentially with number of cells. To overcome this problem, many heuristics have been proposed (Preas and
Lorenzetti, 1988). There are basically three strategies of heuristics for solving the placement problem, namely,
constructive, partitioning, and iterative methods. Constructive methods create placement in an incremental
manner where a complete placement is only available when the method terminates. They often start by placing
a seed (a seed can be a single cell or a group of cells) on the chip and then continuously placing other cells
based on some heuristics such as size of cells, connectivity between the cells, design condition for connection
lengths, or size of chip. This process continues until all the cells are placed on the chip. Partitioning methods
divide the cells into two or more partitions so that the number of connections that cross the partition
boundaries is minimized. The process of dividing is continued until the number of cells per partition becomes
less than a certain small number. Iterative methods seek to improve an initial placement by repeatedly
modifying it. Improvement might be made by transforming one cell to a new position or switching positions
of two or more cells. After a change is made to the current placement conﬁguration based on some cost
4-11
Integrated Circuits

function, a decision is made to see whether to accept the new conﬁguration. This process continues until an
optimal (in most cases a near optimal) solution is obtained. Often the constructive methods are used to create
initial placement on which an iterative method subsequently improves.
Constructive Method
In most of the constructive methods, at each step an unplaced cell is selected and then located in the proper
area. There are different strategies for selecting a cell from the collection of unplaced cells (Wimer and Koren,
1988). One strategy is to select the cell that is most strongly connected to already placed cells. For each
unplaced cell, we ﬁnd the total of its connections to all of the already placed cells. Then we select the unplaced
cell that has the maximum number of connections. As an example consider the cells in Figure 4.15. Assume
that cells c1 and c2 are already placed on the chip. In Figure 4.16 we see that cell c5 has been selected as the next
cell to be placed. This is because cell c5 has the largest number of connections (i.e., three) to cells c1 and c2.
The foregoing strategy does not consider area as a factor and thus results in fragmentation of the available
free area; this may make it difﬁcult to place some of the large unplaced cells later. This problem can be over-
come, however, by considering the product of the number of connections and the area of the cell as a criterion
FIGURE 4.15
Initial conﬁguration.
FIGURE 4.16
Selection based on the number of connections.
4-12
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

for the selection. Figure 4.17 presents an example of such a strategy. Cell c3 is selected as the next choice since
the product of its area and its connections to c1 and c2 combine to associate with the maximum value.
Partitioning Method
The approaches for the partitioning method can be classiﬁed as quadratic and sliced bisection. In both
approaches the layout is divided into two sub-areas, A and B, each having a size within a predeﬁned range.
Each cell is assigned to one of these sub-areas. This assignment is such that the number of interconnections
between the two sub-areas is minimal. For example, Figure 4.18 presents successive steps for the quadratic and
sliced-bisection methods. As shown in Figure 4.18(a), in the ﬁrst step of the quadratic method the layout area
is divided into two almost equal parts; in the second step the layout is further divided into four almost equal
parts in the opposite direction. This process continues until each sub-area contains only one cell. Similar to
the quadratic method, the sliced bisection also divides the layout area into several sub-areas.
The sliced-bisection method has two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, the layout area is iteratively divided into a
certain number of almost equal sub-areas in the same direction. In this way, we end up with a set of slices
(see Figure 4.18(b)). Similarly, the second phase divides the area into a certain number of sub-areas; however,
the slicing is done in the opposite direction.
Several heuristics have been proposed for each of the preceding partitioning methods. Here, for example, we
emphasize the work of Fiduccia and Mattheyses (1982), which uses the quadratic method. For simplicity, their
algorithm is only explained for one step of this method. Initially the set of cells is randomly divided into two
sets, A and B. Each set represents a sub-area of the layout and has size equal to the area it represents. A cell is
selected from one of these sets to be moved to the other set. The selection of the cell depends on three criteria.

Integrated Circuits

The cell should be free, i.e., the cell must have a minimum gain among the gains of all other free cells. A cell c
has gain g if the number of interconnections between the cells of the two sets decreases by g units when c is
moved from its current set to the other. Finally, the selected set’s move should not violate a predeﬁned
balancing criterion that guarantees that the sizes of the two sets are almost equal. After moving the selected cell
from its current set to the complementary set, it is no longer free. A new partition, which corresponds to the
new instance of the two sets A and B, is created. The cost of a partition is deﬁned as the number of
interconnections between cells in the two sets of the partition. The Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm keeps track
of the best partition encountered so far, i.e., the partition with the minimum cost. The algorithm will move the
selected cell to the complementary set even if its gain is negative. In this case, the new partition is worse than
the previous one, but the move can eventually lead to better partitions.
This process of generating new partitions and keeping track of the best encountered partition is repeated until
no free cells remain. At this point in the process, which is called a pass, the algorithm returns the best partition and
terminates. To obtain better partitions, the algorithm can be modiﬁed such that more passes occur. This can easily
be done by selecting the best partition of a pass as the initial partition of the next pass. In this partition, however,
all cells are free. The modiﬁed algorithm terminates whenever a new pass returns a partition that is no better than
the partition returned by the previous pass. This way, the number of passes generated will never be more than the
number of the interconnections in the circuit and the algorithm always terminates.
The balancing criterion in the Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm is easily maintained when the cells have
uniform areas. The only way a pass can be implemented to satisfy the criterion is to start with a random initial
partition in which the two sets differ by one cell, each time select the cell of maximum gain from the larger
sized set, move the cell and generate a new partition, and repeat until no free cells remain.
In the example of Figure 4.19, the areas of the cells are nonuniform. However, the assigned cell areas ensure
that the previously described operation occurs so that the balancing criterion is satisﬁed. (The cell areas are
omitted in this ﬁgure, but they correspond to the ones given in Figure 4.15.) Figure 4.19 illustrates a pass of
the Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm. During this pass, six different partitions are generated, i.e., the initial
partition and ﬁve additional ones. Note that according to the description of the pass, the number of additional
partitions equals the number of cells in the circuit.
Each partition consists of the cells of the circuit (colored according to the set to which they belong and
labeled with an integer), the gain value associated with each free cell in the set from which the selected cell will
be moved (this value can be a negative number), and the nets (labeled with letters). In the ﬁgure, a cell that is
no longer free is distinguished by a circle placed inside the rectangle that represents that cell.
The initial partition has cost 5 since nets a, b, h, g, f connect the cells in the two sets. Then the algorithm
selects cell 1, which has the maximum gain. The new partition has cost 3 (nets e, g, f), and cell 1 is no longer
free. The ﬁnal partition has no free cells. The best partition in this pass has cost 3.
Iterative Method
Many iterative techniques have been proposed. Here, we emphasize one of these techniques called simulated
annealing. Simulated annealing, as proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. (1983), makes the connection between
statistical mechanics and combinatorial optimization problems. The main advantage with simulated annealing
is its hill-climbing ability, which allows it to back out of inferior local solutions and ﬁnd better solutions.
Sechen (1990) has applied simulated annealing to the placement problem and has obtained good solutions.
The method basically involves the following steps:
BEGIN
1. Find an initial conﬁguration by placing the cells randomly. Set the initial temperature T and the
maximum number of iterations.
2. Calculate the cost of the initial conﬁguration.
A general form of the cost function may be: Cost ¼ c1 · Area of layout þ c2 · Total interconnection
length, where c1 and c2 are tuning factors.

The parameter T is called temperature; it is initially set to a very large value so that the probability of
accepting ‘‘uphill’’ moves is very close to one, that it is slowly decreasing toward zero, according to a rule called
the cooling schedule. Usually, the new reduced temperature is calculated as follows:
new temperature ¼ (Cooling rate) · (old temperature)
Using a faster cooling rate can result in getting stuck at local minima; however, a cooling rate that is too slow
can pass over the possible global minima. In general, the cooling rate is taken from approximately 0.80 to 0.95.
Usually, the stopping criterion for the while-loop is implemented by recording the cost function’s value at
the end of each temperature stage of the annealing process. The stopping criterion is satisﬁed when the cost
function’s value has not changed for a number of consecutive stages.
Though simulated annealing is not the ultimate solution to placement problems, it gives very good results
compared to the other popular techniques. The long execution time of this algorithm is its major
disadvantage. Although a great deal of research has been done in improving this technique, substantial
improvements have not been achieved.
Routing Techniques
Given a collection of cells placed on a chip, the routing problem is to connect the terminals (or ports) of these
cells for a speciﬁc design requirement. The routing problem is often divided into subproblems: global, area,
detailed, and specialized routing.
The global router considers the overall routing region in order to distribute the nets over the channels based
on their capacities while keeping the length of each net as short as possible. For every channel that a net passes
through, the net’s id is placed on the sides of the channel. Once the terminals of each channel are determined,
the detailed router connects all the terminals with the same id by a set of wire segments. (A wire segment is a
piece of material described by a layer, two end-points, and a width.)
Area routers can be used for the general routing problem. The general purpose routers impose very few
constraints on the routing problem and operate on a single connection at a time. Since these routers work on
the entire design in a serial fashion, the size of the problems they can attempt is limited. They are typically
used for specialized routing problems or small routing regions. These routers can do a good job of modeling
the contention of nets for the routing resources and therefore can be viewed as routing the nets in parallel.
The specialized router is designed to solve a speciﬁc problem such as routing of the wires for the clock
signals, and power and ground wires. Wires for clock signals must satisfy several timing constraints. Power and
ground wires also require special attention for two reasons: (1) they are usually routed in one layer in order to
reduce the parasitic capacitance of contacts, and (2) they are usually wider than other wires (signal and data)
since they carry more current.
Global Routing
Global routers generate a nonfully speciﬁed route for each net. They assign a list of channels to each net
without specifying the actual geometric layout for each wire. The global routing phase typically consists of
three phases. The ﬁrst phase partitions the routing space into channels and is called the channel deﬁnition
phase. Channels include areas between placed blocks or above them. The second phase is called region
assignment and identiﬁes the list of channels each net is going through. The last phase is called pin assignment
and assigns for each net a pin for each channel boundary it crosses.
At the end of the global routing phase the length of each net can be estimated. If some net fails to meet its
timing speciﬁcations, it needs to be ripped up and re-routed. Area routers can be used for rerouting of ripped-
up nets or the global routing phase is repeated.
A typical objective in the global routing problem is to minimize the sum of the estimated lengths of the
globally routed nets. In addition, the number of nets crossing each channel boundary should not violate a pre-
speciﬁed capacity for the boundary. This problem is NP hard even for a single multiterminal net and is known
as the Steiner tree problem. In high-performance circuits, the objective is modiﬁed so that the maximum
4-16
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

diameter of selected Steiner trees is minimized. The diameter of a Steiner tree is deﬁned as the maximum
length of a path between any two pins on the Steiner tree. This is also an intractable problem.
The global routing problem is typically studied as a graph problem. The most general and accurate model
for global routing is the channel intersection model. For a given layout, each vertex of the graph represents a
channel intersection. Two vertices are adjacent if there exists a channel between them. Often channel
intersection graphs are extended so that the pins on the nets are included in the vertices of the graph. That
way, connections between the pins can be considered.
Area Routing
Algorithms for this problem are categorized as maze routing, line probing, and shortest path-based. Since the
problem of routing a multiterminal net is difﬁcult, each multiterminal net is decomposed into several two-
terminal nets. Then each resulting two terminal net is routed using either: (a) maze routing algorithms that use
grid graphs; (b) line probing algorithms where the search of the minimum connection is guided by line segments
instead of grid nodes; or (c) modiﬁcations of Dijkstra-based shortest path algorithms for general graphs.
This subsection focuses on maze routing algorithms.
A maze router is a shortest-path algorithm on grid
graphs. It ﬁnds the shortest rectilinear path by propagat-
ing a wavefront from a source point toward a destination
point (Lee, 1969). Considering the routing surface as a
rectangular array of cells, the algorithm starts by marking
the source cell as visited. In successive steps, it visits all the
unvisited neighbors of visited cells. This continues until
the destination cell is visited. For example, consider the
cell conﬁguration given in Figure 4.20.
We would like to ﬁnd a minimal-crossing path from
source cell A (cell 2) to destination cell B (cell 24). (The
minimal-crossing path is deﬁned as a path that crosses
over the fewest number of existing paths.) The algorithm
begins by assigning the start cell 2 to a list, denoted as L,
i.e., L consists of the single entry {2}. For each entry in
L, its immediate neighbors (which are not blocked) will
be added to an auxiliary list L0. (The auxiliary cell list L0
is provided for momentary storage of names of cells.)
Therefore, list L0 contains entries {1,3}. To these cells a
chain coordinate and a weight are assigned, as denoted
in Figure 4.21. For example, in cell 3, we have the pair
(0, !), meaning that the chain coordinate is toward the
right and the cell weight is zero. The weight for a cell
represents the number of wires that should be crossed in
order to reach that cell from the source cell. The cells
with minimum weight in list L0 are appended to list L.
Thus, cells 1 and 3 are appended to list L. Moreover, cell
2 is erased from list L. Appending the immediate
neighbors of the cells in L to L0, we ﬁnd that list L0 now
contains entries 4 and 8. Note that cell 8 has a weight of
1; this is because a wire must be crossed in order to
reach this cell. Again the cells with minimum weight in
list L0 are appended to list L, and cell 3 and cell 1 are
erased from L. Now L contains entry {4}. The above
procedure is repeated until it reaches the ﬁnal cell B.

Then a solution is found by tracing the chain coordinated
from cell B to cell A as shown in Figure 4.22.
The importance of Lee’s algorithm is that it always
ﬁnds the shortest path between two points— the source
and the target. Since it routes one net at a time, however,
there is a possibility of having some nets unrouted at the
end of the routing process. The other weak points of this
technique are the requirements of a large memory space
and long execution time. For this reason, the maze
router is often used as a side router for the routing of
critical nets and/or routing of leftover unrouted nets.
Signiﬁcant reductions in the space requirements are
obtained using the A* search method (Sherwani, 1999), also known as Hadlock’s minimum detour
algorithm. The length of the path is obtained by adding on the invariant Manhattan distance twice the
number of path detour points, which is called the path’s detour number. A vertex on a path is called a
detour point if it is directed as we move from the source to the target along the path. Thus, the path
length is minimized by minimizing its detour number. Lee’s algorithm is modiﬁed so that the wavefront is
guided by detour numbers rather than distances from the source.
Detailed Routing
Detailed routers typically distinguish between channels that only have pins on two opposite sides as opposed
to channels that have pins on three or more. Provided that no routing regions are available above blocks, the
former type, called a simple channel, is deﬁned by the region between placed blocks, whereas the latter type is
deﬁned by their intersection areas. The latter type is also called a 2D switchbox. For regions where routing over
placed cells is possible, 3D switchboxes are deﬁned. A 3D switchbox is a channel with pins on six sides
(Sherwani, 1999). Typically, simple channels are routed ﬁrst, since they expand, then the 2D switchboxes and
ﬁnally the 3D switchboxes.
To reduce the complexity of the problem, this type of router often uses a rectangular grid on which
trunks (horizontal wire segments) and branches (vertical wire segments) are typically placed on different
layers. This is known as the Manhattan model. However, in a non-Manhattan model, the assignment of a
layer to a vertical or horizontal direction is not enforced. Given the freedom of direction, assignment to
layers reduces the channel width and vias in many cases; the latter model usually produces a better result
than the former.
Two or more layers are used for detailed routing. In the following, we assume the Manhattan model, and
two layers for routing. One layer accommodates trunks and the other branches. We consider only simple
channels whose two boundaries are horizontal lines. The goal is to connect all the net endpoints so that the
number of horizontal lines that contain a net segment is minimized. These horizontal lines are called tracks.
This amounts to minimizing the total area required for the simple channel. This is also called the width of the
simple channel. In the literature, many different techniques have been proposed for simple channel routers. In
general, these techniques can be grouped into four different approaches: (1) algorithms (such as left-edge,
greedy, hierarchical); (2) expert systems; (3) neural networks; and (4) genetic algorithms (Lengauer, 1990;
Zobrist, 1994; and Sarrafzadeh, 1996).
Many algorithmic approaches resemble the operation of the left-edge algorithm, which was proposed for
printed circuit board (PCB) routing. In PCB routing there is enough room to shift the position of the pins on
the channel boundaries so that are no channel boundary pins on the same vertical line.
The left-edge algorithm ﬁrst sorts the nets according to their leftmost endpoint. See also Figure 4.23(a). The
nets are examined in their sorted order. A net is allocated to a new track only if it cannot be assigned to an
existing track due to overlapping with the horizontal portion of a net that has already been assigned in the
track. Figure 4.23(b) shows the routed channel by the left-edge algorithm, which uses four tracks, i.e., the
channel width is 4. Notice that each net has only one trunk.
FIGURE 4.22
Final step.

The left-edge algorithm guarantees minimum channel width if no channel boundary pins are on the same
vertical line. However, the two-layer simple channel routing problem is intractable in the more general case
where several pairs of channel boundary pins share vertical lines. In this case, more complex routing
algorithms apply. Typically, a net is routed with more than one trunk. This is also called routing using doglegs.
Doglegs are useful in reducing the channel width. The channel of Figure 4.24(a) has two tracks but without
doglegs, three tracks are needed. Some channel instances are infeasible to route without doglegs. This case is
illustrated in Figure 4.24(b).

Introduction
Very large scale integration (VLSI), complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit
(IC) technologies have evolved from simple digital circuits consisting of basic logic functions a few decades
ago, to today’s extraordinarily complex and sophisticated digital circuits consisting of hundreds of millions of
transistors (Weste and Eshraghian, 1993; Wolf, 1994; Chandrakasan and Broderson, 1995; Baker et al., 1998;
Chen, 1999; Uyemura, 1999). The routine placement of such a vast number of transistors on a thumbnail-
sized substrate has enabled a vast number of technological advances, ranging from personal computers
through sophisticated consumer products to new technologies appearing almost everywhere. These integrated
circuits are the primary representation of microelectronics, electronic circuits/systems created using micron
dimension devices. Already, dimensions have decreased below the micron level and we are entering the new
era of nanoelectronics with dimensions in the nanometer range (1 nanometer equals 1/1000th of a micron, a
small scale that can be visualized by recognizing that the diameter of a human hair is about 30 to 40 microns).
This progression is continuing, following Moore’s ‘‘law’’, which states that the number of transistors per IC
doubles every 18 months. Table 4.2 summarizes the information provided in the 1994 version (National
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 1994) of the industry roadmap, providing a look both forward to
the future generations and backward to prior generations. The most recent report is the 2003 version
(International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, 2003).
Accompanying the evolution to these highly complex ICs has been an evolution of the tools and principles
supporting correct and efﬁcient design of such sophisticated circuits. These tools and principles capture the
lessons of over three decades of experience obtained during earlier generations of the IC technologies.
Although design of a contemporary VLSI circuit remains a signiﬁcant challenge, computer-aided design
(CAD) and electronics design automation (EDA) software tools (Rubin 1987; Hill and Peterson 1993;
Sherwani, 1993; Banerjee, 1994; Trimberger, 2002) substantially simplify the effort involved.
Perhaps the most familiar example of the rapidly advancing VLSI technologies is the personal computer
(PC), which today provides the casual user with computing power exceeding that of supercomputers of the
recent past. The microprocessor (e.g., Pentium, PowerPC, etc.) is a general-purpose IC whose speciﬁc function
can be customized to an application through the use of programs running on the PC. The ﬂexibility seen in
microprocessors is the result of a design intended to efﬁciently perform several basic functions in a ﬂexible
environment in which those functions can be manipulated by the user to perform the desired application.
However, that ﬂexibility is obtained at the expense of performance. If the function to be performed by an IC

Integrated Circuits

can be made speciﬁc (e.g., analyzing images for content), then signiﬁcant performance advantages normally
result by designing an IC speciﬁcally for that function (and no others) (Parhi, 1998). Representative
performance metrics include power dissipation (e.g., for battery-operated products) (Sanchez-Sinencio, 1999),
computation rates (e.g., for handling image analysis) and other factors. In applications for which the
performance advantages are considerable, application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs) provide an
important alternative to general-purpose integrated circuits.
The traditional distinction between general-purpose and application-speciﬁc integrated circuits is, however,
increasingly blurred as a result of the substantial complexity available in a contemporary VLSI circuit. For
example, it is possible to integrate a microprocessor that was a full IC a few years ago with application-speciﬁc
circuitry to create an integrated, application-speciﬁc system on a single IC. This leads to the concept of
‘‘system on a chip’’ (SoC) (Wolf, 2002) in which a single IC is essentially the entire digital system. For the
purposes of this section, we deﬁne ‘‘application-speciﬁc’’ as meaning that the IC is designed to provide
substantial performance beneﬁts compared to the performance achievable with general-purpose digital
components.
Primary Steps of VLSI ASIC Design
The VLSI IC design process consists of a sequence of well-deﬁned steps (Preas and Lorenzetti, 1988; Hill et al.,
1989; DeMicheli, 1994a,b) related to the deﬁnition of the functions to be designed; organization of the circuit
blocks implementing these logic functions within the area of the IC; veriﬁcation and simulation at several
stages of design (e.g., behavioral simulation, gate-level simulation, circuit simulation [White and Sangiovanni-
Vincentelli, 1987; Lee et al., 1993]); routing of physical interconnections among the functional blocks; and
ﬁnal detailed placement and transistor-level layout of the VLSI circuit. The design process starts with a
hierarchical top-down planning (Gajski, 2002), functionally specifying one of the blocks comprising the IC,
representing that block in terms of simpler blocks and proceeding to more detailed levels until the transistor-
level description has been completed. During this process, information gained as one moves toward the most
detailed level may lead to changes in the assumptions used at higher levels of the design. In this case, ‘‘back-
annotation’’ is used to update the representations of the higher-level functions, perhaps requiring a retraversal
of the design steps to the most detailed level.
Representative steps in this process are illustrated generally in Figure 4.25(a), where details of feedback
loops have been suppressed. An illustrative example (Lipman, 1995) of a design process including the
speciﬁc feedback loops is shown in Figure 4.25(b). The general steps shown in Figure 4.25(a) are as
follows:
A. Behavioral Speciﬁcation of Function: The behavioral speciﬁcation is essentially a generalized description
of what the function will do, without detailed regard for the manner in which the function is
constructed. High-level description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL (Armstrong, 1989; Lipsett et al.,
1990; Mazor and Langstraat, 1992; Bhaskar, 1999; Rustin, 2001) and Verilog (Thomas and Moorby,
1991) provide a framework in which the behavior of a function can be speciﬁed using a programming
language (VHDL based on the ADA programming language and Verilog based on the Cþþ
programming language). These HDLs support system descriptions that are strongly tied to the physical
realization of the function. The behavioral description relates generally to a data sheet for a circuit
function. Also provided are structural descriptions (describing how the function is constructed from
simpler
subfunctions)
and
dataﬂow
descriptions
(describing
how
signals
ﬂow
through
the
subfunctions). Figure 4.26(a) illustrates this speciﬁcation of an overall function in terms of subfunctions
(A[s], B[s], . . .., E[s]) as well as expansion of one of these subfunctions (C[s]) in terms of still simpler
functions (c1, c2, c3, . . ., c6).
B. Veriﬁcation of Function’s Behavior: It is important to verify that the design descriptions (behavioral,
structural, and others) truly provide the function sought by the designer. VHDL and Verilog are
specialized forms of their underlying programming languages (ADA and Cþþ, respectively) developed
to explicitly support simulation of the outputs of represented functions, given inputs to the functions.
The designer can then apply an appropriate set of test inputs to the design function and compare the
4-22
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

function’s output with the expected outputs. This veriﬁcation is repeated for all levels of the hierarchical
design, ranging from the simplest low-level functions up through the overall function of the IC. These
HDLs also provide means of including realistic signal properties such as delays through circuits and
along interconnections, thereby allowing evaluations of signal timing effects.

C. Mapping of Logical Functions into Physical Blocks: Next, the logical functions, e.g., A(s), B(s), . . ., E(s) in
Figure 4.26(a) are converted into physical circuit blocks A(b), B(b), . . ., E(b) in Figure 4.26(b). Each
physical block represents a logical function as a set of interconnected gates. Although details of the
physical layout are not known at this point, the estimated area and aspect ratio (ratio of height to width)
of each circuit are needed to organize these blocks within the area of the IC.
D. Floor Planning: Next, the individual circuit blocks are compactly arranged to ﬁt within the minimum
area (to allow the greatest amount of logic to be placed in the IC area). Floor planning establishes this
organization, as illustrated in Figure 4.26(c). At this stage, routing of interconnections among blocks has
not been performed, perhaps requiring modiﬁcations to the ﬂoor plan to provide space when these
interconnections are added. During ﬂoor planning, the design of a logic function in terms of a block
function can be modiﬁed to achieve a shape that better matches the available IC area. For example, the
block E(b) in Figure 4.26(b) has been redesigned to provide a different geometric shape for block E(f) in
the ﬂoor plan in Figure 4.26(c).
E. Veriﬁcation/Simulation of Function Performance: Given the ﬂoor plan, it is possible to estimate the
average length of interconnections among blocks (with the actual length not known until after
interconnection routing is completed in Step F below). Signal timing throughout the IC is estimated,
allowing veriﬁcation that the various circuit blocks interact within timing margins.
F. Placement and Routing: When an acceptable ﬂoor plan has been established, the next step is to complete
the routing of interconnections among the various blocks of the design. As interconnections are routed,
the overall IC area may need to expand to provide the area needed for the wiring, with the possibility
that the starting ﬂoorplan (which ignored interconnections) is not optimal. Placement (Shahookar and
Mazumder, 1991) considers various rearrangements of the circuit blocks, without changing their
internal design but allowing rotations, reﬂections, etc. For example, the arrangement of some of the
blocks in Figure 4.26(c) has been changed in the arrangement in Figure 4.26(d).
G. Veriﬁcation/Simulation of Performance: Following placement and routing, the detailed layout of the
circuit blocks and interconnections has been established and more accurate simulations of signal timing
and circuit behavior can be performed, verifying that the circuit behaves as desired with the interblock
interconnections in place.
H. Physical Design at Transistor/Cell Level: Each block in the discussion above may itself consist of
subblocks of logic functions. The same sequence of steps listed above can be applied to place those
subblocks, route their interconnections, and simulate performance. This process continues at successive
levels of detail in the circuit design, eventually reaching the point at which the elements being placed
are individual transistors and the interconnections being routed are those among the transistors. Upon
completion of this detailed level, the set of physical masks can be speciﬁed, translating the transistor-
level design into the actual physical structures within the layers of the silicon device fabrication. Upon
completion of the mask designs, the details of the physical circuit dimensions are available.
I.
Veriﬁcation/Simulation of Performance: Before fabricating the masks and proceeding with manufacture
of the ASIC circuit, a ﬁnal veriﬁcation of the ASIC is normally performed. Figure 4.25(b) represents this
step as ‘‘golden simulation,’’ a process based on detailed and accurate simulation tools, tuned to the
process of the foundry and providing the ﬁnal veriﬁcation of the performance of the ASIC.
Increasing Impact of Interconnection Delays on Design
In earlier generations of VLSI technology (with larger transistors and wider interconnection lines/spacings),
delays through low-level logic gates greatly dominated delays along interconnection lines. Under these condi-
tions, it was often possible to move blocks of circuitry in the steps discussed above without excessive concern
regarding the lengths of connections among the blocks since the interconnection delays were of secondary
concern. However, as feature sizes have decreased, delays through logic gates have also decreased. For tech-
nologies with feature sizes less than about 0.5 microns, interconnection delays became larger than logic delays.
Figure 4.27 illustrates these delay issues on technology scaling to smaller feature sizes. A logic function F in
a previous-generation technology requires a smaller physical area and has a higher speed in a later scaled
4-24
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

technology (i.e., a technology with feature size decreased). Although intrablock line lengths decrease (relaxing
the impact within the block of the higher resistance R* per unit length and the higher capacitance C* per unit
length of the interconnect line, leading to a larger R*C* delay), the interblock lines continue to have lengths
proportional to the overall IC size. The result is a larger R*C* delay on the interblock lines.
When interconnect delays dominate logic delays, movements of logic blocks in the design steps in the
previous section become more complicated because rearranging the logic blocks causes interconnection line
lengths to change, leading to substantial changes in the timing of signals throughout the rearranged circuit.
The distinction made here can best be understood by considering the two limiting cases:
. Case 1: Logic delays are nonzero and interconnect delays are zero (roughly representing earlier
generations of VLSI circuits). In this limiting case, the speed performance of a VLSI circuit does not
depend on where the various blocks are placed on the IC.
. Case 2: Interconnect delays are nonzero and logic delays are zero (roughly representing current
generations of VLSI circuits). In this limiting case, the speed performance of a VLSI circuit depends
completely and critically on the detailed placement of the various blocks.
This challenge can be relaxed in part through the use of architectural approaches that allow long
interconnect delays among blocks of the VLSI circuit. However, the sensitivity to placement and routing also
requires that designs evolve through an iterative process as illustrated by the back- and forward-annotation
arrows in Figure 4.25(a). Initial estimates of delays in Step B need to be reﬁned through back-annotation of
interconnection delay parameters obtained after ﬂoorplanning and/or after placement, and routing to reﬂect
the actual interconnection characteristics, perhaps requiring changes in the initial speciﬁcation of the desired
function in terms of logical and physical blocks. This iterative process moving between the logical design and
the physical design of an ASIC has been problematic since often the logical design is performed by the
company developing the ASIC, whereas the physical design is performed by the company (e.g., the ‘‘foundry’’)
fabricating the ASIC. CAD tools are important vehicles for coordination of the interface between the designer
and the foundry.
General Transistor Level Design of CMOS Circuits
The previous subsection emphasized the CAD tools and general design steps involved in designing an ASIC.
A top-down approach was described, with the designer addressing successively more detailed portions of
the overall design through a hierarchical organization of the overall description of the function. However,

Integrated Circuits

the design process also presumes a considerable understanding of the bottom-up principles through which
the overall IC function will eventually appear as a fully detailed speciﬁcation of all the transistor and
interconnection structures throughout the overall IC (Dillinger, 1988; Weste and Eshraghian, 1993; Kang and
Leblebici, 1996; Rabaey, 1996; Baker et al., 1998).
Figure 4.28 illustrates the transistor-level description of a simple three-input NAND gate. VLSI ASIC logic
cells are dominated by this general structure where the PMOS transistors (used to create the pull-up section)
are connected to the supply voltage Vdd and the NMOS transistors (used to create the pull-down section) are
connected to the ground return GND. When the logic function generates a logic ‘‘one’’ output, the pull-up
section is shorted through its PMOS transistors to Vdd while the pull-down section is open (no connection to
GND). For a logic ‘‘zero’’ output, the pull-down section is shorted to GND whereas the pull-up section is open.
Since the logic output is either ‘‘zero’’ or ‘‘one,’’ only one of the sections (pull-down or pull-up) is shorted and
the other section is open, with no DC ﬂowing directly from Vdd to GND through the logic circuitry. This leads
to a low DC power dissipation, a factor that has driven the dominance of CMOS for VLSI circuits.
The PMOS transistors used in the pull-up section are fabricated with p-type source and drain regions on
n-type substrates. The NMOS transistors used in the pull-down section, however, are fabricated with n-type
source and drain regions on p-type substrates. Since a given silicon wafer is either n-type or p-type, a deep,
opposite doping-type region must be placed in the silicon substrate for those transistors needing a substrate of
the opposite type. In Figure 4.28, a p-type substrate (supporting the NMOS transistors) is assumed. The
shaded region illustrates the area requiring the deep doping to create an n-type well in which the PMOS
transistors can be fabricated. As suggested in this ﬁgure, the n-type well can extend across a signiﬁcant length,
covering the area required for a multiplicity of PMOS transistors. For classical CMOS logic cells, the same set
of input signals is applied to both the pull-up and the pull-down transistors. As shown in Figure 4.28(b),
proper sequencing of the PMOS and NMOS transistors allows the external connection (A, B, etc.) to extend
straight down (on polysilicon, passing under the Vdd metal interconnection) to contact both the PMOS and
corresponding NMOS transistor. Algorithms to determine the optimum sequence of transistors evolved in
early CAD tools.
Each logic cell must be connected to power (Vdd) and ground (GND), requiring that external power and
ground connections from the edge of the IC be routed (on continuous metal to avoid resistive voltage drops)
to each logic cell on the IC (Zhu, 2004). Early IC technologies provided a single level of metalization on which
to route power and ground, leading to the interdigitated layout illustrated in Figure 4.29(a). Given this layout
FIGURE 4.28

layout. (b) Transistor representation using parallel rows of PMOS and NMOS transistors, with interconnections connected

approach, channels of pull-up sections and channels of pull-down sections were placed between the power and
ground lines (Figure 4.29(b)). If all logic cells had the same height (regardless of the number of transistors in
the pull-up and in the pull-down sections), the layout of the circuit becomes much simpler and areas for logic
cells can be more easily estimated. This can be achieved by organizing the PMOS and the NMOS transistors
in single rows, as illustrated in Figure 4.28(b). Under these conditions, logic cells can be abutted against one
another as shown in Figure 4.30 while retaining the convenience of straight power and ground lines.
To interconnect transistors within a logic cell, area between the PMOS and NMOS transistors is provided for
intra-cell transistor interconnections. This allows each cell to be identiﬁed by an enclosing box (dotted lines
in Figure 4.30) and each such box labeled (e.g., by the name of the logic function). Connections to and from
the enclosing box are inter-cell interconnections, which are completed in the inter-cell wiring channel in
Figure 4.30.
After completing the detailed transistor-level designs of the logic cell, that cell can be used as a ‘‘block’’ to
build a higher-level logic function (e.g., a logic function comprised of several basic logic gates and ﬂip-ﬂops).
At this higher level of description, the details within the box are discarded and only the named box appears.
The designer at this stage does not ‘‘see’’ the internal wiring within the logic cells and therefore cannot
run interconnection wires across named boxes without being in danger of shorting to internal ‘‘hidden’’
interconnections. This restriction has been relaxed by current VLSI technologies using multiple layers of
metalization. For example, if all internal interconnections within a box are restricted to layer one of metal,
then higher layers of metal can pass over the named box without danger of shorting. However, the problem of
not ‘‘seeing’’ internal details of boxes reappears at the next higher level of design and special ‘‘boxes’’ (switch
boxes) containing interconnections only are often used as a means of routing signals in one inter-cell wiring
channel to a wiring channel above or below that channel.

ASIC Technologies
Drawing on the discussion above regarding transistor-level design, the primary ASIC technologies (full-
custom, gate arrays, ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays, etc.) can be easily summarized.
Full Custom Design
In full custom design, custom logic cells are designed for the speciﬁc low-level functions desired and the logic
cells are selected, placed, and interconnected to optimally create the desired IC logic function. As illustrated in
Figure 4.31(a), all elements of the overall design are generated in detail according to the function desired. The
design can also incorporate nonstandard, low-level logic circuitry as desired.
Standard Cell ASIC Technology
With a sufﬁciently rich set of predesigned, low-level logic cells, it is possible to design the entire VLSI circuit
using only that set of cells. The standard cell design (Heinbuch, 1987; SCMOS Standard Cell Library, 1989)
makes use of libraries of standard cell layouts which are used as low-level ‘‘blocks’’ to create the overall design.
The overall design proceeds as in full custom design (and is represented by Figure 4.32(a)), but uses someone
else’s low-level cell designs.
Gate Array ASIC Technology
The gate array design (Hollis, 1987) is based on partially prefabricated (up to but not including the ﬁnal
metalization layer) wafers populated with low-level logic cells and stored until the ﬁnal metalization is
completed. Since they are prefabricated, a decision has been made regarding the number and placement of
each of the low-level logic cell functions as well as the inter-cell interconnections. From the perspective of the
VLSI designer, low-level logic cells have been deﬁned and placed already, without regard for the overall VLSI
function to be performed. The ASIC designer maps the desired logic function onto this array of logic cells,
using those needed and ignoring those not needed (these will be ‘‘wasted’’ logic cells). Figure 4.33 illustrates
this step.
The gate array technology shares the costs of masks for all layers except the metalization layer among all
ASIC customers, exploiting high-volume production of these gate array wafers. The ASIC customer incurs the
cost of the metalization mask and the fabrication cost for that last metalization step. There is clearly wasted
circuitry (and performance lost, since interconnections will tend to be longer than in full custom or standard
cell designs).
CMOS Custom Circuits with Megacell Elements
As the complexity of VLSI ICs has increased, it has become possible to include standard, higher-level func-
tions (e.g., microprocessors, DSPs, PCI interfaces, MPED coders, RAM arrays, etc.) within a custom ASIC.
FIGURE 4.31

For example, an earlier generation microprocessor might offer a desired functionality and would occupy only a
small portion of the area of the custom VLSI IC. Including such a microprocessor has the advantage of
allowing the custom designer to focus on other parts of the design and also provides users with a standard
microprocessor instruction set and software development tools. Such large cells are called megacells and are
essentially detailed, mask-level designs (or other usable function descriptions) provided by the ‘‘owner’’ of the
higher-level function.
Programmable Logic: Use of General Purpose Logic Cells
The programmable gate array (PGA), like the gate array discussed above, places ﬁxed cells in a two-dimensional
array organization on the IC and the application user designs an application function from this array.
However, in contrast to the simple logic functions seen in standard gate array technology, the cells of the PGA
are complex logic functions (often including ﬂip-ﬂops) whose function can be speciﬁed by the user. In this
sense, the user is ‘‘designing’’ the individual cells of the array. In addition to specifying the function to be
performed by each of the generalized logic cells, the user speciﬁes the interconnections among the logic cells
and the overall input/output connections of the IC.
One version of this technology requires a ﬁnal fabrication step to embed the user’s design in the IC. The
ﬂexibility of the generalized logic cells typically leads to a more efﬁcient design (logic per unit area, speed, etc.)
than standard gate array approaches. In addition, rather than designing masks to create the interconnections,

layout with ﬁxed width channels (in prefabricated, up to metalization, wafers).

the IC during customization.

Integrated Circuits

normally closed ‘‘antifuses’’ are included to allow one-time programming of the logic cells and their
interconnectionsby opening the fuses.
The second version, the ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA),1 is completely fabricated and packaged
when obtained by the user. ‘‘Field programmability’’ refers to the ability of a user to program the functionality
of the IC by loading data information into the FPGA, in much the same manner that one can program the
information stored in memory by loading (‘‘writing’’) that information into the memory IC. Rather than
using antifuses that must be opened during a ﬁnal fabrication step, the FPGA provides electronically alterable
fuses that can be written once or electronic switches whose control signals are stored in local storage elements
(after being ‘‘written’’) in the FPGA. Storage of programming information on ﬂip-ﬂops within the FPGA leads
to volatile operation (the stored FPGA program information is lost when power is turned off), whereas
storage of the information in EPROM (write once memory) or EEPROM (multiple write memory) provides
nonvolatile operation.
Figure 4.34 shows an example of cells and programmable interconnections for an earlier simple but
representative FPGA technology (Actel, 1995). The array of cells is constructed from two types of cell,
which alternate along the logic cell rows of the FPGA. The combinational logic cell — the ‘‘C-module’’ in
Figure 4.34(a) — provides a ROM-based lookup table (LUT) capable of realizing any complex logic function
with four inputs and two control signals. The sequential cell — the ‘‘S module’’ in Figure 4.34(b) — adds a
ﬂip-ﬂop to the C module, allowing efﬁcient realization of sequential circuits. The interconnection approach
illustrated in Figure 4.34(c) is based on (1) short vertical interconnections directly connecting adjacent
modules, (2) long vertical interconnections extending across the IC height, (3) long horizontal
interconnections extending across the IC width, (4) points at which the long vertical interconnections can
be connected to cells, and (5) points at which the long vertical and horizontal lines can be used for general
routing. The long vertical and horizontal lines are broken into segments, with programmable links between
successive segments. The programmer can then connect a set of adjacent line segments to create the desired

programmable logic circuits. However, like the term ‘‘Xerox’’ which has come to be used generically, ‘‘ﬁeld-programmable gate
array’’ (FPGA) has come to be used generically for this style of VLSI circuit.

interconnection line between nonlocal modules. In addition, programmable connection points allow the
programmer to make transitions between the long vertical and long horizontal lines. By connecting various
control inputs to a module of the FPGA to either Vdd or GND, the module can be ‘‘programmed’’ to perform
one of its possible functions. The basic array of modules is complemented by additional driver and other
circuitry around the perimeter of the FPGA for interfacing to the ‘‘external world.’’
Different FPGA manufacturers have developed FPGA families with differing basic cells, seeking to provide
the most useful functionality for generation of the overall FPGA custom function.
The ability of the user to completely change the function performed by the FPGA simply by loading a
different set of programming information has led to a number of interesting architectural opportunities for
systems designers. For example, microprocessor applications in which the actual hardware of the
microprocessor and the instruction set of the microprocessor can be changed during execution of a software
program to provide an overall architecture optimized for the speciﬁc operations being performed. FPGAs do
not provide the level of performance seen in full custom VLSI designs and are substantially more expensive
than large volume production of the full custom designs. Software tools have been developed to allow easy
translation of an FPGA design into a higher performance (and lower cost) PGA or other VLSI technologies.
Interconnection Performance Modeling
Accurate estimation of signal timing throughout a VLSI circuit is increasingly important in contemporary VLSI
ASICs (in which interconnection delays often dominate the speed performance) and becomes increasingly
important as technologies are scaled to smaller feature sizes. High clock rates impose tighter timing margins,
requiring more accurate modeling of the delays on both the global clock signal and other signals.
The increasing importance of interconnection delays (Gradinski, 2000; Hall et al., 2000) relative to gate
delays can be seen in the history of VLSI technologies. In the earlier 1-micron VLSI technologies, typical gate
delays were about six times the average interconnection delays. For 0.3-micron technologies, the decreasing
gate delays led to average interconnection delays being about six times greater than typical gate delays.
Accurate estimation of signal delays early in the design process is increasingly difﬁcult since the designer does
not have, at that point in the design process, accurate estimates of interconnection lengths and nearby lines
causing crosstalk noise. Only much later in the design when the blocks have been placed and interconnections
routed do these lengths and interline couplings become well known. As the design proceeds and the
interconnection details become better understood, parameters related to signal timing can be fed back (back-
annotated) to the earlier design steps, allowing modiﬁcations in those steps to achieve the required
performance.
In earlier VLSI technologies, a linear delay model was adequate, representing the overall delay T from the
signal input to one cell (cell A in Figure 4.35) to the input of the connected cell (cell B in Figure 4.35). Such a
delay model has the general form t ¼ tð0Þ þ k1·CðoutÞ þ k2·tðsÞ, where t0 is the intrinsic (internal) delay of
the cell with no output loading, CðoutÞ is the capacitive load seen by the output driver of the cell, tðsÞ is the
(no load) rise/fall time of the cell’s output signal, and the parameters k1 and k2 are constants (perhaps
geometry dependent). In the case of deep submicron CMOS technologies, the overall delay must be divided
FIGURE 4.35
Logic cell delay (intrinsic delay) and intercell interconnection (extrinsic delay).
4-31
Integrated Circuits

into the intrinsic delay of the cell and the extrinsic delay of the interconnect—each delay having substantially
more complex models than the linear model.
Factors impacting the intrinsic delay of cells include the following, with the input and output signals
referring to logic cell A in Figure 4.35:
1. Different input states during an input signal’s transition may lead to different delays through the
cell.
2. Starting from the time when the input starts to change, slower transition times lead to longer delays
before the threshold voltage is reached, leading to longer delays to the output transition.
3. Once the input passes the threshold voltage, a slower changing input may lead to a longer delay to the
output transition.
4. The zero-to-one change in an input may cause a delay different than a one-to-zero change.
These are merely representative examples of the more complex behavior seen in the logic cells as the feature
size decreases.
The models used for interconnections (Tewksbury, 1994; Hall et al., 2000) have also changed, reﬂecting the
changing interconnection parameters and increasing clock rates. The four primary models are as follows:
Lumped RC Model: If the rise/fall times of the signal are substantially greater than the round-trip
propagation delay of the signal, then the voltage and current are approximately constant across
the length of the interconnection. As a result, the interconnection can be modeled using a single
lumped resistance and a single lumped capacitance leading to an RC delay model (the resistance
of the driver and the capacitance of the load must be included to obtain the total RC time
constant).
Distributed RC Model: If the interconnection line is sufﬁciently long, the rise/fall time of the signal will be
less than the round-trip propagation delay of the signal. In this case, the voltages and currents at any
instant in time are not constant along the length of the interconnection. In this case, the long line can be
divided into smaller segments, each sufﬁciently small to allow use of a lumped RC model for the
segment. The result is a series of lumped RC sections and a delay resulting from this series.
Distributed RLC Model: As the rise/fall times become shorter, the relative contributions of capacitance and
inductance change. The impedance associated with the line capacitance is inversely proportional to
frequency and decreases as the signal’s frequencies increase. The impedance associated with the line
inductance (negligible in the cases above) is proportional to frequency and increases as the frequencies
increase. At signal frequencies sufﬁciently high that the inductive impedance is not negligible, the
distributed RC model must be replaced by a distributed RLC model.
Transmission Line Model: At still higher signal frequencies, the representation of the interconnection as a
series of discrete segments fails and a differential model of the interconnection is required. This leads to
the traditional transmission line model with characteristic impedance, reﬂections, and other standard
transmission line effects. The delay is represented by a signal ‘‘propagating’’ along the interconnection
line, arriving at different points along the line at different times. Termination of the interconnection in
the characteristic impedance of the transmission line is needed to avoid problems associated with signal
reﬂections at the ends of the line.
Given the wide range of interconnection lengths found in a typical IC (with very short interconnects
connecting adjacent logic cells and with very long interconnections extending across the entire IC), all four
models above are relevant (the transmission line model arising, however, only for very high signal
frequencies). In all cases, knowledge of the capacitance C* and inductance L* per unit length along the lines is
essential. To model crosstalk effects, the coupling capacitance per unit length to nearby lines must be known.
With multiple metal layers now used for interconnections, this calculation of the coupling capacitance has
become more difﬁcult, particularly since the value of the coupling capacitance depends on the routing and
placement of nearby interconnections.
The discussion above has highlighted signal interconnections. However, the voltages appearing on the
power and ground interconnections are not constants, but instead reﬂect the resistive losses and changing
4-32
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

currents on those power and ground interconnections. Overall, signal integrity management is a critical
element of the design process for very high speed VLSI.
Clock Distribution
The challenge of managing signal timing across an entire IC containing millions of gates is substantially
relaxed by the use of synchronous designs. In such designs, signals are regularly retimed using clocked ﬂip-
ﬂops, synchronizing the times when signals change to the transition time of a clock signal. In this manner, the
complexities of signal timing can generally be restricted to local regions of an IC. Today’s ICs use a vast
number of retiming points (often in the form of data registers) for this purpose. To be generally effective (and
to avoid extreme complexities in adjusting signal delays throughout an IC), these synchronous designs employ
a common clock signal distributed in such a manner that its transition times are the same throughout the IC.
Clock skew is the maximum difference between the times of clock transitions at any two ﬂip-ﬂops in the overall
IC and typically has a value substantially smaller than the clock period. For example, part of the clock period
of a high speed VLSI circuit is consumed by the rise/fall times of the signals appearing at the inputs to the ﬂip-
ﬂops. Another part of the clock period is consumed by the required time that the signal at the input to a ﬂip-
ﬂop must remain constant before (setup time) and following (hold time) the clock transition at the ﬂip-ﬂop.
As a result, to achieve maximum speed, the clock skew must generally be less than about 20% of the clock
period. For a 500-MHz clock (with clock period equal to 2 nsec), this represents a clock skew of only
about 0.2 nsec.
The distance over which the clock signal can travel along an interconnection line before incurring a delay
greater than the clock skew deﬁnes isochronous regions within the IC. If the common external clock signal can
be delivered to each such region with zero clock skew, then clock routing within the isochronous region is not
critical. Figure 4.36(a) illustrates the H-tree approach, providing clock paths from the clock input point to all
points in the circuit along paths of equal length (and ideally, therefore, delivering clocks to each of the
terminal points with zero clock skew). In a real circuit, precisely zero clock skew is not achieved since different
network segments encounter different environments of data lines coupled electrically to the clock line segment.
In addition, the net load seen by a clock signal once distributed to an isochronous region can differ among
those regions.
In Figure 4.36(a), a single buffer drives the entire H-tree network, requiring a large area buffer and wide
clock lines toward the point where the H-tree is connected to the clock input. Such a large buffer can account
for up to 30% or more of the total VLSI circuit power dissipation. Figure 4.36(b) illustrates a distributed buffer
approach, with a given buffer only having to drive those clock line segments to the next level of buffers. In this
case, the buffers can be smaller and the clock lines narrower.
The constraint on clock timing is a bound on clock skew, not a requirement for zero clock skew.
In Figure 4.36(c), the clock network uses multiple buffers but allows different path lengths consistent with
FIGURE 4.36

unequal line lengths but within skew tolerances.

Integrated Circuits

clock skew margins. For tight margins, an H-tree can be used to deliver clock pulses to local regions in which
distribution proceeds using a different buffered approach such as that in Figure 4.36(c).
Other approaches for clock distribution are gaining in importance as clock rates increase but sizes of
ICs remain constant. For example, a lower frequency clock can be distributed across the IC, with locally
distributed phase-locked loops (PLLs) used to multiply the low clock rate to the desired high clock rate.
In addition to multiplying the clock rate, the PLL can also adjust the phase of the high rate clock. Using
this approach, clocks conﬁned to regions of an IC can be synchronous, whereas different regions do not
have

clocks.

Power Distribution
Present-day VLSI circuits can be broadly separated into two groups: one for performance-oriented
applications and the other for portable (battery-operated) applications. Power dissipations in the ﬁrst group
can be considerable, with contemporary VLSI circuits consuming 40 to 80 watts, corresponding to currents in
the 10 to 40 amp range. Voltage and ground lines must be properly sized to prevent the peak current density
from exceeding the level at which the metal interconnection will be physically ‘‘blown out,’’ leading to a
catastrophic failure of the circuit. Even if total power dissipation is modest, current densities appearing on
power and ground lines can be large due to the small cross-sectional area of those lines. Another serious
limitation is imposed by electromigration. The ﬂow of current (moving electrons) creates a pressure on the
metal ions of an interconnection, causing a slow migration (electromigration) of the metal atoms in the
direction of the current ﬂow. The problem is particularly important in power and ground lines where the
current direction (pressure direction) is always in the same direction (i.e., signal lines tend to have currents
ﬂowing in alternating directions, with less net pressure in any given direction). At points in the aluminum
interconnection where discontinuities appear (e.g., due to the grain structure of the aluminum), the ﬂow
becomes nonuniform and voids in the interconnection line gradually develop. There is a threshold level (about
1 mamp/micron) below which electromigration is greatly reduced and circuit designs seek to operate below
this threshold. In addition, copper can be added to the aluminum (ﬁlling the intergrain spaces) to reduce the
creation of voids due to electromigration. This issue may be relaxed with the trend toward use of copper
metalization as a replacement for aluminum due to its lower resistivity.
A quite different issue in power distribution concerns ground bounce (or simultaneous switching noise). The
problem arises due to the inductance associated with connecting the input/output pads of an IC to the IC
package. The voltage drop DVL across this inductance LI=O due to a changing current ILðtÞ through
the inductance is given by DVL ¼ LI=O · ½dIL=dt	 < LI=O · IL;0=ttrans where LL;0 is the average current through
the I/O and ttrans is the average transition time of the current through the I/O. This voltage drop appears on
the signal I/O pins, adding a degree of noise to the signal. However, the current ﬂowing out of (into) the I/O
pin is delivered from (into) the power (ground) connection to the IC. If M output signals change
simultaneously, then the corresponding voltage swing across the inductance at the power connection to the IC
is M times larger than that seen on the signal. With contemporary ICs having hundreds of I/O pins, this
multiplier factor is large. Furthermore, with the increasing speeds of ICs, the transition times of signals at the
I/O pins is decreasing. All these factors lead to the potential for very substantial voltage swings on the IC side
of the power connection. To reduce these swings, much lower inductance is required for the power (and for
the ground) connection. This is achieved by using a large number of power input pins (placing their respective
inductances in parallel). It is not unusual for the number of power and ground connections to be comparable
to the number of signal interconnections in today’s VLSI circuits.
Analog and Mixed Signal ASICs
The discussion above has focused on digital ASICs not because digital ICs are the most common form of
application-speciﬁc circuit but rather because the underlying issues related to the VLSI design are easier to
4-34
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

describe. Ideally, digital circuits involve signals at only two levels: Vdd corresponding to logic value ‘‘one’’ and
GND corresponding to logic value ‘‘zero.’’ Analog circuits are profoundly more complex since the signals are
continuously varying signals and the behavior and performance of an analog circuit depend critically on this
continuous variation. Digital circuits can be reduced, at their lowest level, to simple logic gates and ﬂip-ﬂops.
Analog circuits, however, have far more diverse and complex lowest-level functions. Digital circuits are
basically switches and are simpliﬁed considerably by this basis. Analog circuits typically seek to obtain linear
circuit functions with nonlinear devices (or exploit nonlinear devices to create specialized nonlinear analog
circuit functions). Digital circuit technologies providing user programmable logic cells are straightforward
approaches. Generic high-performance analog circuits based on interconnections of user programmable
analog circuit cells are far less straightforward. For all these reasons and others, analog circuits tend to be
custom ICs almost by their nature. To provide an environment supporting the efﬁcient and correct custom
design of analog circuits, a distinct set of CAD tools (Rutenbar et al., 2002) have emerged, along with a rich
history of designs for standard analog circuit functions such as ampliﬁers, voltage dividers, current mirrors,
etc. Similar to the hardware description languages (HDLs) widely used for design of digital circuits,
analog hardware description languages (AHDLs) are advancing rapidly to support design of complex analog
circuits.
Much of the history of integrated circuits has separated the design of digital and analog circuits, relegating
each to separate ICs. However, there have been a rapidly increasing number of applications in which the co-
integration of digital and analog circuits is favored. Such mixed-signal ICs are particularly important
examples of application-speciﬁc ICs, with both the analog and digital sections customized to perform the
overall ‘‘system’’ function. Such mixed signal circuits have been a part of the IC family for some time (Geiger
et al., 1990; Comer, 1994; Ismail and Fiez, 1994; Laker and Sansen, 1994; Sanchez-Sinencio and Andreou,
1999; Handkiewicz, 2002; Tsividis, 2002). General-purpose mixed-signal ICs are seen in the example of
microcontrollers (e.g., Park and Barrett, 2002), combining a basic microprocessor with memory and analog
peripheral components. Special-purpose mixed-signal ICs are seen, for example, in contemporary wireless
transceiver designs (Abidi et al., 1999; Leung, 2002), combining the analog circuitry to handle the higher
frequency operations and digital circuitry to handle baseband operations. These mixed-signal ICs are also seen
in today’s automobiles, providing an interface between sensors monitoring the automobile and the control
associated with such sensors (e.g., engine controls).
Summary
For over four decades, microelectronics technologies have been evolving, starting with primitive digital logic
functions and evolving to the extraordinary capabilities available in present-day VLSI ICs containing complete
systems or subsystems and vast amounts of memory on a single IC. ASIC technologies (including the EDA/
CAD tools that guide the designer to a correctly operating circuit) provide the innovative user with
opportunities to create ICs with performance and functionalities not readily available using general-purpose
ICs, often making the difference between a successful product and a product that can not be differentiated
from others. VLSI technologies have advanced to the point that entire systems are implemented on a single IC
(the SoC approach), providing applications with miniaturized electronics with substantial capabilities. This
trend toward entire systems on a single IC will drive the interest in ASICs in the future. In a real sense, the
customization achieved by custom designing a printed circuit board to hold a selected set of commercial ICs
has migrated to the IC level.

Low-Power Design Techniques
Christian Piguet
Introduction
Low-power design of integrated circuits has to be addressed at all levels of design, i.e., from systems,
architectures, logic, and physical levels. It is shown that most of the power can be saved at the highest levels,
mainly by modifying or simplifying the speciﬁcations. Less power can be saved at low levels, but reducing
power consumption of standard cell libraries and memories can be applied to all applications, contrary to
power savings at high levels, which is strongly application dependent.
Large Power Reduction at High Level
If one considers the past history of microelectronics, the extrapolated power consumption for high-end
microprocessors would be about 2000 watts and 3000 amperes in 2010.1 Clearly, this is impossible, and a set of
low-power techniques, as described in this chapter, have to be applied to get more reasonable power
consumption.
The most important observation regarding low-power techniques is that most of the power can be saved at
the highest design levels. At the system level, low-power design techniques such as partition, activity reduction,
reduction of the number of steps, simplicity, data representation, and locality (cache or distributed memory
instead of a centralized memory) have to be chosen. These choices are, however, strongly application
dependent.2 At the lowest design levels, for instance, for a low-power library, only a moderate factor
(about two) in power reduction can be reached.
Power Consumption of Digital Circuits
Power consumption of digital circuits results in three components, i.e., dynamic, short-circuit, and static
power. Although static power is larger and larger in deep submicron technologies, the ﬁrst part of this section
focuses on the reduction of dynamic power. The dynamic power consumption of a digital circuit is given
by P ¼ a · f · C · Vdd2 in which a is the circuit activity (number of switching gates over the total number
of gates), f is the frequency of switching, C is the capacitance of the gate or of the module (extracted from
the layout), and Vdd is the supply voltage. Energy can be considered as well. The energy is the power · delay
product, and using the expression of the delay ¼ 1/f, the energy becomes energy ¼ a · C · Vdd2.
In the design process, one can consider different architectures for a speciﬁed function. It is therefore
necessary to perform a speed/power comparison in order to select the ‘‘best’’ architecture. Such a comparison
is not so easy, as it depends on a large number of design parameters. One has to consider a basic operation (or
an instruction) in a logic block or a microprocessor. Such an operation (instruction) is generally executed in
4-38
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

clocks per operation (CPO) (clocks per instruction [CPI]) clock periods or steps. A step is executed at the
frequency f in a clock period T ¼ 1/f. The energy per operation, which is independent of the frequency, can
therefore be computed as energy/operation ¼ CPO · a · C · Vdd2.
Some Basic Rules
There are some basic rules that can be proposed to reduce power consumption at system levels:
Reduction of the number N of operations to execute a given task.
A too high sequencing always consumes more than the same functions executed in parallel.
Consequently, parallel architectures provide better CPO or CPI, as well as pipelined and RISC architectures.
The lowest Vdd for the speciﬁc application has to be chosen.
The goal is to design a chip that just ﬁts the speed requirements.3
Large Power Reduction at High Level
As mentioned before, a large part of the power can be saved at high level. Factors of 10 to 100 or more are
possible. However, it means that the resulting system could be quite different, with less functionality or less
programmability. The choice among various systems is strongly application dependent. One has to think
about systems and low power, to ask good questions to the customers, and to get reasonable answers. This will
be illustrated by some examples. Power estimation at high level is a very useful tool to check what will be the
estimated total power consumption.
Processor vs. Random Logic
It should be noted that a microcontroller-based implementation results in a very high sequencing. This is due
to the microcontroller structure, which is based on the reuse of the same operators and registers (ALU,
accumulators). For instance, only one step (N ¼ 1) is necessary to update a hardware counter (Figure 4.37).
For its software counterpart, the number of steps is much higher while executing several instructions with
many clock cycles in sequence. This simple example shows that the number of steps executed for the same task
can be very different depending on the architecture. For a wristwatch, 2000 instructions were necessary to
update the time vs. N ¼ 1 step for a random logic circuit.
The conclusion is that a microprocessor is a stupid idea to save power, as it provides too high sequencing for
a given task. However, if they are preferred today, it is due to their ﬂexibility.
Number of Clock Cycles per Instruction
An example of too high sequencing is provided by complex instruction set computers (CISC) micro-
controllers. Their architectures come from the ﬁrst Von Neumann microprocessor architectures with a single

Integrated Circuits

uniﬁed memory. Furthermore, this memory is organized in bytes, resulting in many memory accesses through
a single 8-bit bus, as most of the instructions are coded with 2 or 3 bytes. It basically explains why the number
of CPI is very high.
As an example, Table 4.3 shows a comparison of the number of instructions used to program a short routine
(synchrone transmission, shifting out 8-bit data and clock). It can be seen that the number of instructions in
the program, the number of bytes, as well as the number of executed instructions are quite similar for these
microcontrollers. However, regarding low power, Table 4.3 shows the number of executed clocks for this
routine. One can see that the resulting CPI is quite large for the ﬁrst CISC microcontrollers in the list. The last
two in the list are more reduced instruction set computers (RISC)-like and do present a reduced CPI, mainly
the CoolRISC with a single clock cycle per instruction.4 As the energy per clock cycle is roughly the same, it
means that the energy per instruction is proportional to CPI shown in Table 4.3, demonstrating that too high
sequencing impacts highly on power consumption.
Processor Types
The choice of a processor is very important regarding power consumption. First, the data width of the
processor has to be the same as the processed data. It results in a substantially increased sequencing to manage,
for instance, 16-bit data on 8-bit microcontrollers. For a 16-bit multiply, 30 instructions are required (add-
shift algorithm) on a 16-bit processor, while 127 instructions are required on an 8-bit machine (double
precision). A better architecture is to have a 16 · 16-bit parallel-parallel multiplier with only one instruction to
execute a multiplication.
Another issue is to choose the right processor for the right task. For control tasks, digital signal processing
DSP (digital signal procesing) processors are largely inefﬁcient. But conversely, microcontrollers for DSP tasks
are also quite inefﬁcient! For instance, to perform a JPEG compression on an 8-bit microcontroller requires
about 10 million executed instructions for a 256 · 256 image (CoolRISC, 10 MHz, 10 MIPS, 1 sec per image).
It is quite inefﬁcient. Factor 100 in energy reduction can be achieved with JPEG-dedicated hardware.
Figure 4.38 shows probably the best architecture to save power. For many applications, there is some control
that is performed by a microcontroller (the best machine to perform control). However, in most applications,
there are also other tasks to execute, which could be a DSP task, convolution, JPEG, image compression, or
another task. The best architecture is consequently to use a speciﬁc machine (co-processor) to execute these
tasks, i.e., one co-processor per task so that these tasks are executed by the smallest and the most energy-efﬁcient
machines.
Memories
Memory organization is very important to reduce the energy per memory access. Generally, memories consume
most of the power. So it is immediately obvious that memories have to be designed hierarchically. No memory
technology can simultaneously maximize speed and capacity at lowest cost and power. Data for immediate
use are stored in expensive registers, in cache memories, and less used data are stored in large memories.
For each application, the choice of the memory architecture is very important. One has to think of
hierarchical, parallel, interleaved, and cache memories, sometimes several levels of cache, to try to ﬁnd the best
trade-off. The application algorithm has to be analyzed from the data point of view to ﬁnd the best way to
organize the data arrays and how to access these structured data.

If a cache memory is used, it is possible, for instance, to minimize the number of cache misses while using
adequate programming as well as good data organization in the data memory. For instance, in inner loops of a
program manipulating structured data, it is not equivalent to write: (1) do i then do j or (2) do j then do I,
depending on how the data are located in the data memory.
The Energy-Flexibility Gap
Figure 4.39 shows that the ﬂexibility,5 i.e., the use of a general-purpose processor or of a specialized DSP
processor, has a large impact on the energy required to perform a given task compared to the execution of the
same given task on dedicated hardware.
Pipelined and Parallel Digital Circuits
As a too high sequencing is not favorable for reducing power, many techniques such as pipelining and
parallelism have been proposed at architecture levels to reduce dynamic power consumption.
Pipelining
Pipelining is a very effective technique to increase the throughput without generating a too large overhead that
could compromise the power consumption reduction. Figure 4.40 shows an execution unit composed of
several logic blocks connected in series. By inserting registers between the logic blocks (Figure 4.41), the delay

Integrated Circuits

for each logic block is reduced to a quarter of the total delay of the previous execution unit. Therefore the
frequency and the throughput can be increased by a factor of 4 with a small overhead and a small power
consumption increase.
The pipelining technique is largely used in microprocessors. One has to take into account the latency, i.e.,
the data output is issued after four delays (Figure 4.41). Pipelining can also be used to signiﬁcantly reduce the
power consumption if the throughput is kept constant in both the execution units described, respectively, in
Figure 4.40 and Figure 4.41. In the latter, frequency can be reduced by a factor of 4 while maintaining the same
throughput, and consequently the power consumption, proportional to frequency, is similarly reduced by a
factor of 4.
Parallelization
Circuit parallelization has been proposed to maintain, at a reduced Vdd, the throughput of logic modules that
are placed on the critical path.6–8 It can be achieved with M parallel units clocked at f/M. Results are provided
at the nominal frequency f through an output multiplexer controlled by f/2 (Figure 4.42). Each unit can
compute its result in a time slot M times longer, and can therefore be supplied at a reduced supply voltage. If
the units are data paths or processors,7 the latter have to be duplicated, resulting in an M times area
and switched capacitance increase. Applying a dynamic power formula, one can write P ¼ M · C · f/M ·
Vdd2 ¼ C · f · Vdd2. Power consumption reduction is only achieved by the reduction of Vdd. One can see
on the timing diagram in Figure 4.42 that the output multiplexer is controlled at f/2. The operation or access
of unit 2 is started before the completion of the operation of unit 1. Therefore, M successive computations do
not have to be dependent on each other.
However, some parallelized logic modules do not require M unit duplication. It is the case, for instance, for
memories8 in which each unit contains 1/M data or instructions, resulting in the same total number of bits to
store the information (Figure 4.43). In such a case, the dynamic power is P ¼ C · f/M · Vdd2. Consequently,
power could be saved even if Vdd is not reduced. However, some overhead has to be considered, such as the
address registers duplication and the output multiplexer (Figure 4.43).
Figure 4.44 shows a parallelized shift register. Such a concept has been proposed for CCD serial
memories.9,10 The input is successively provided to the upper or to the lower half shift register at a reduced
frequency, while the output multiplexer restores the output at the frequency f. There is no latency due to the
fact that the combinatorial circuit of the state machine ‘‘shift register’’ is only constituted by wires, with no
associated delay. The total number of D ﬂip-ﬂops is the same as in the nonparallelized shift register.8 In this
case also, power is saved without reducing Vdd, but it is still possible to save more power by reducing Vdd as
each part of the shift registers is clocked at f/2.

Table 4.4 shows the simulation results of an 800-bit shift
register working at 6 GHz and 1.8 volt in a 0.18 mm
technology. It has been parallelized from two to eight parts.
Power consumption reduction at the same given supply
voltage is quite interesting.
Latch-Based and Gated Clocked Circuits
At the architecture level, a major issue regarding low power is
the clocking scheme. In deep submicron technologies, as wire
delays are larger than gate delays, the distribution of the clock
through
the
complete
chip
is
the
main
problem
for
synchronous architectures. Several low-power techniques
have been proposed, such as asynchronous architectures that
work without any clock.11 Other techniques that still keep
synchronous architectures while drastically reducing power
consumption are presented in the following.
Latch-Based Design
Digital circuits are today described in VHDL and are
automatically synthesized with a logic synthesizer. Most
VHDL descriptions are based on a single clock that is
connected to master-slave ﬂip-ﬂops. This clocking scheme implies the generation of a single clock tree that
is more and more difﬁcult to design to obtain a very small clock skew, i.e., a time difference between the arrival
of the clock at all ﬂip-ﬂops, which is as small as possible.
Another clocking scheme called ‘‘latch-based’’ can be used with many advantages. Figure 4.45 shows this
concept, consisting of latch-based registers clocked by two different nonoverlapping clocks Ø1 and Ø2
generated by two different clock trees. This scheme has been chosen to be more robust to clock skew, ﬂip-ﬂop
failures, and timing problems at very low voltage. The clock skew between various Ø1 and Ø2 pulses has to be

shorter than half a period of the master clock CK, which is not too difﬁcult to achieve. Because of the
nonoverlapping of the clocks and the additional time barrier caused by having two latches instead of one ﬂip-
ﬂop, latch-based designs support greater clock skew before failing than a similar ﬂip-ﬂop-based design, each
targeting the same throughput.
This allows the synthesizer and router to use smaller clock buffers and to simplify the clock tree generation,
which will reduce the power consumption of the clock tree. Therefore, the clock skew becomes relevant only
when its value is close to the nonoverlapping of the clocks. Furthermore, if the chip has clock skew problems at
the targeted frequency after integration, it is possible in a latch-based design to reduce the clock frequency. The
result is that the clock skew problem will disappear, allowing the designer to test the chip functionality
and eventually detect other bugs or validate the design functionality. This can reduce the number of test
integrations needed to validate the chip. With a ﬂip-ﬂop-based design, when a clock skew problem appears,
the complete circuit must be rerouted and integrated again.
Using latches can also reduce the MOS of a design. For instance, a microcontroller register bank has 16 · 32
bit registers, i.e., 512 ﬂip-ﬂops with about 13,000 MOS. With latches, the master part of the registers can be
common for all the registers, which gives 544 latches, or about 6500 MOS. In this example, the register bank
transistor count is reduced by a factor of 2.
Gated Clocks
The gated clock technique is extensively used in the design of low-power circuits.12,13 It is based on the fact
that a register need not be clocked when its next state is identical to its previous state. Some logic is used to
detect if such registers have to be clocked or not. ALUs, for instance, can be designed with input and control
registers that are loaded (or clocked) only when an ALU operation has to be executed. During the execution of
another instruction (branch, load/store), these registers are not clocked; and thus no transitions occur in the
ALU (Figure 4.46). A similar mechanism is used for pipeline stages if an instruction execution is ﬁnished at a
given pipeline stage. The clock of the next pipeline stages is thus gated as the next pipelines have nothing to do
and therefore no transitions occur in these last stages of the pipeline.

Gated Clock with Latch-Based Designs
The latch-based design also allows a very natural and safe clock gating methodology. Figure 4.47 shows a
simple and safe way of generating enable signals for clock gating. This method gives glitch-free clock signals
without the addition of memory elements, as is needed with ﬂip-ﬂop clock gating. Logic synthesizers handle
the latch-based design methodology very nicely. However, generally, clock gating combined with latch-based
design cannot be inserted automatically by a logic synthesizer. The designer has to write the description of the
clock gating in his VHDL code. The most critical problem is to prevent the synthesizer from optimizing the
clock gating AND gate with the rest of the combinational logic. To ensure a glitch-free clock, this AND gate
has to be placed as shown in Figure 4.47. This can easily be done manually by the designer by placing these
AND gates in a separate level of hierarchy of the design or placing a ‘‘don’t touch’’ attribute on them. Forcing a
‘‘don’t touch’’ on these gates presents the drawback that this part of the clock tree will not be optimized for
speed or clock buffering.
Low-Power Standard Cell Libraries
At the logic level, digital logic design is performed today by using standard cell libraries and place and route
CAD tools. As mentioned earlier, power savings at this level are limited. However, even if it is only a factor of
2, it is not application dependent, and all chips designed with a low-power library will present reduced power
consumption. Many different logic styles or logic families have been and continue to be proposed for general
purpose and specialized standard cell libraries. Low power is even more important than speed and silicon area,
but it is increasingly difﬁcult to achieve such a power reduction in very deep submicron technologies as well as
for specialized libraries for self-timed or cryptographic applications.
Static CMOS Logic
Static CMOS is the older and still most used logic family. It is
still considered the simplest and most robust logic style.14 Each
CMOS gate is constructed with two dual N-ch and P-ch
networks connected, respectively, between Vss and Vdd and the
gate output. Any logic Boolean function can be designed by
connecting CMOS transistors in series and/or parallel in the two
N-ch and P-ch networks, provided that inputs are available in
true and complemented forms.
The design of a CMOS gate is generally performed by
synthesizing the N-ch network by taking the ‘‘zero’’ cubes in the
Karnaugh map of the Boolean function. The P-ch network is
then derived as the dual network by connecting in series
(parallel) the transistors that are in parallel (series) in the N-ch
network. Figure 4.48 shows the synthesis of a Boolean function
given by a Karnaugh map, in which the z symmetrical equation
contains two terms, the ﬁrst one with the ‘‘zero’’ cubes indicated by {0} and the second term with the ‘‘one’’
cubes indicated with {1}. The MOS structure of the N-ch and P-ch networks are then designed as zN and zP,

by taking the ﬁrst term {0} as such and by inverting each letter in the second term {1}, as P-ch transistors are
conducting when they have a ‘‘zero’’ on their gate. In the zN and zP expressions, AND operators mean a serial
connection of transistors while OR operators mean a parallel connection. This method has been introduced in
order to be capable of having the two N-ch and P-ch expressions as sums of products. As described in the next
paragraph, it results in the so-called ‘‘branch-based’’ logic style that provides some advantages with respect to
layout regularity, better performances in speed and power, and a better testability.15,16
Branch-Based Logic
In branch-based logic,15 logic cells are designed exclusively with branches composed of transistors in series
connected between a supply line and the gate output (Figure 4.49). The number of MOS in series is limited
to three for speed performances. The main advantage of such an implementation is the layout density. For
instance, the symbolic layout of the nonbranch-based P-ch network (Figure 4.49) contains two
supplementary contacts with two drain parasitic capacitances that can be removed in the more compact
branch-based implementation. The symbolic layout of Figure 4.49 comes from the logical equation
S ¼ (BþC) (A ·Cbarþ Abar · D). If implemented as such, the P-ch network is shown in the top of
Figure 4.49. If a Karnaugh map is designed, the minimal number of blocks of ‘‘one’’ that are necessary is
three, resulting in the branch-based implementation with six transistors shown in the bottom of Figure 4.49.
It can be seen that the latter is a very regular layout consisting of three branches. It provides no diffusion
interruption, a common drain for two branches, a minimal number of contacts, and few metal connections.
This is not the case, for instance, for the implementation shown at the top of Figure 4.49, where a product
of sum has to be implemented with a supplementary wire. This branch-based technique, ﬁrst introduced to
reduce parasitic capacitances for achieving low power,14 is also beneﬁcial for high-speed logic such as fast
adders in SOI technology.16
An obvious drawback of this technique is the possible increase in the number of transistors when realizing a
MOS network of complex CMOS gates with a sum of products (a transistor controlled by the same input in
two parallel branches is repeated). However, this problem is not too serious. A standard cell library does not
contain a large number of complex gates. The most used cells are simple gates, ﬂip-ﬂops, latches, and
multiplexers. In a 200 cell library, some cells contain one supplementary transistor (XOR, AOI, OAI, latches
with reset, D ﬂip-ﬂops, frequency dividers) and a few cells contain two supplementary transistors (latches and
ﬂip-ﬂops with set/reset).
Transmission Gates
Transmission gate-based design has been largely used in the past, as MOS transistors are very good switches.
Transmission gates use two complementary transistors, as a single N-ch pass transistor (for instance,
FIGURE 4.49
Branch-based layout.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

presenting Vgate-source ¼ 0 when it has to conduct Vdd from its source to its drain) only reaches Vdd-VT at its
output. In the same situation, the complementary P-ch transistor has a full Vgate-source ¼ Vdd and provides
Vdd at the output of the transmission gate. Rules of thumb are often used for the design of these transmission
gate-based cells. It is shown here that the same basic methodology introduced for ‘branch-based’ logic can be
applied to transmission gates or pass-transistor circuits.
A transmission gate, controlled by an input variable, connects or not another input variable to the gate
output. This means that some inputs are connected to transistor sources and not just to the gates of
transistors. Compared to the branch-based style, for which sources of transistors or branches are
always connected to Vss {0} or to Vdd {1}, in transmission gate designs, sources of transistors, or branches
can also be connected to input variables. Thus, some cubes in the Karnaugh map are not only ‘zero’ cubes
indicated by {0} or ‘one’ cubes by {1}, but also some cubes identiﬁed by {input}. The content of the cubes is
not ‘zero’ or ‘one’, but is identical to a given input variable (or the complemented input). As a result, some
cubes containing ‘zero’ and ‘one’ can be chosen, provided that the arrangement of ‘zero’ and ‘one’ are identical
to a given input.
Figure 4.50 provides an example for which one cube is a conventional cube with {0} and for which two
other cubes are transmission cubes containing zero and one. From Figure 4.50, it can be seen that the top cube
content is identical to the input variable d, while the other cube content is identical to the complement of the
input variable d. As such, the designer can write the symmetrical equation of output x by a ﬁrst term
representing the ‘zero’ cube {0} and by two other terms for which the only difference is that they refer to input
variables, i.e., {d} and {d-bar}. The N-ch and P-ch networks are then derived using the same rules, i.e., the
terms with {0} and {input} are selected without any change for the N-ch network xN, while the terms with {1}
and {input} are selected for the P-ch network xP by inverting each letter in the expression of the cubes. The
transmission cubes give a contribution in both N-ch and P-ch networks, as the designer wants to obtain a
transmission gate-based circuit. If only N pass transistors are required, only the contribution of the
transmission cubes in the N-ch network is necessary. The example of Figure 4.50 shows that both cube types,
{0} or {1}, and {input} can be simultaneously synthesized. The resulting circuit will therefore contain some
branches connected to Vss (and Vdd) and other branches connected to input variables.
The symbolic schematic of the resulting circuit (Figure 4.50), designed in such a way that branches are
highlighted, shows, for instance, that two branches are connected to input d, i.e., one P-ch branch controlled
by c and b bar and one N-ch branch controlled by c bar and b. These two branches do implement two
transmission gates connected in series.
Transmission gate-based circuits do have a smaller number of transistors compared to static CMOS logic.
However, in terms of layout density, depending on the layout style, the cell area is often very similar. Some

circuits are advantageously designed as transmission gate-based design, such as XOR gates and adders (based
on XOR gates), but other basic cells in a library can be designed in static CMOS logic without any penalty.
N Pass Logic
Before CMOS became the mainstream technology, N-MOS logic was extensively used with a depleted
transistor as the load device. N-MOS pass transistor logic was also used for many cells, resulting in a very low
transistor count. However, in N-MOS logic, the gate output produces a Vdd-VT voltage. Although it was not a
problem many years ago with Vdd at 5.0 V, it is a major drawback today with supply voltages close to or below
1.0 V. In order to keep the transistor count low, N pass logic can be used by having an output keeper or a
restoring transistor as shown in Figure 4.51 for an XOR gate. This logic style is called single pass transistor
logic (SPL). The keeper device is used to force full Vdd at the output when the inverted output is zero.
This logic style seems to be interesting only for multiplexers and XOR gates, explaining why it is generally
benchmarked for adders and multipliers. This SPL could compete with static CMOS at high Vdd, but not at
low Vdd, where SPL is slower and consumes much more than static CMOS.
Figure 4.51 shows another similar logic style called complementary pass transistor logic (CPL) and shows a
2:1 multiplexer. This CPL style is dual rail logic, as both true and complemented outputs are provided.
A comparison (Table 4.5) with static CMOS shows some advantages in speed at high Vdd, but not better
performances at low Vdd,17 the transistor count being similar to static CMOS. There are many other logic
styles inspired by SPL and CPL, such as dual rail differential cascode voltage switch logic (DCVSL),18 for which
the two N-ch networks are not designed as N-pass logic but as conventional N-ch networks. Two cross-
coupled P-ch MOS are used as load devices, similar to two P-ch MOS of the CPL logic shown in Figure 4.51. It
is a ratioed logic, as the N-ch networks have to ﬁght against the P-ch devices.
Standard Cell Libraries
Standard cell libraries often provide a huge number of cells, up to 300 or even 500. A new approach is
proposed, which is based on a limited set of standard cells.20 The number of functions for the new library has
been reduced to 22 and the number of layouts to 92. It can be seen that the ratio between the number of
layouts and the number of functions is larger (92/22 ¼ 4.2 instead of 220/60 ¼ 3.6 for the previous library).
This means that the number of cell and buffer drives is larger. For speed and power optimization achieved by
the logic synthesizer, the increased ratio of layouts to functions, as shown above, is beneﬁcial.
It seems obvious that the logic synthesizer could do a better job if the number of cells in the library was
large. With a larger choice, it should be possible to provide a better solution. However, this is not the case.
Experiments in Table 4.6 and Table 4.7 show that the delay of some operators is signiﬁcantly reduced with the
new library, resulting in a very small increase in silicon area (Table 4.6) and that the silicon area is reduced at
the same speed with the new library (Table 4.7). These results show that the logic synthesizer is more efﬁcient

because it has a limited set of well-chosen cells and cell sizing adapted to the considered logic synthesizer. With
signiﬁcantly fewer cells than conventional libraries, the synthesizer is not lost in some optimization loops due
to a too large choice of cells.
The design of the library has been based on keeping only very fast cells, i.e., to remove all the cells with
three P-ch transistors in series and to have a very limited number of cells with two P-ch transistors in
series. The number of cell layouts for the same function has been increased. However, it is not a simple
increase from, for instance, sizing D1 (small transistors), D2, and D3 (medium-sized transistors) to D1,
D2, D3, D4, and D5 (very large transistors). The cell sizing performed takes into account how the
synthesizer uses the considered cells. The third consideration is based on buffer insertion, i.e., the
combination of a given cell and of a buffer to replace complex gates.
Such a strategy must be checked through many experiments. The choice of the 22 functions was performed
with a large number of experiments with and without a speciﬁc cell, and then the decision was made to either
insert this cell or not in the library. Similar experiments were performed with various sizing and buffering of
the cells. At the end, only 22 functions and 92 layouts were kept in the new library.
Furthermore, as the number of layouts is drastically reduced, it takes less time to design a new library for a
more advanced process. Substantial time can also be saved for the library characterization, which is known to
be often the most time-consuming activity in library design. Reducing the number of layouts from 220 to 92 is
a signiﬁcant advantage. The reduction of the number of cells implies removal of complex gates from the
library, forcing the logic synthesizer to decompose complex gates, which, as described, is beneﬁcial in terms
of speed.
It will also be a crucial point in future libraries for which more versions of the same function will be
required while considering static power problems. The same function could be realized, for instance, with low
or high VT for double-VT technologies, or with several cells such as a generic cell with typical VT, a low-power
cell with high VT and a fast cell with low VT.
Logic Styles for Speciﬁc Applications: Self-Timed Design
The design of cell libraries is largely considered to be independent of the applications, i.e., any library can be
used for any application. This assumption no longer holds today, as certain speciﬁc applications require

special cell libraries. It is the case, for instance, for self-timed design, but also for other applications such as
adiabatic circuits, cryptographic applications, and fault tolerant logic. Self-timed logic, i.e., digital circuits
without any master clock or asynchronous logic, has been introduced to solve the problem of the clock tree
synthesis, which is proved to be more and more difﬁcult, and power consuming.11,22
Several asynchronous techniques have been proposed at the block and/or cell levels. They are based on
handshaking, i.e., a local control of the data shifted in a pipeline. This control logic is largely based on
C Muller elements, not generally proposed by conventional libraries. For asynchronous design, it would be
beneﬁcial to have this C gate as a library cell. Another logic style that is used in self-timed architectures is
dynamic DCVSL dual-rail logic. During precharged phase, both outputs are ‘‘11,’’ an invalid state. After
evaluation, the valid state is reached (‘‘01’’ or ‘‘10’’), indicating that the operation is completed. This signal is
consequently used to start the next operation (Request) and to acknowledge the previous pipeline stage
(Acknowledge). In a manner similar to global clocks, in which rising edges are used for synchronization, rising
and falling edges of these ‘Request’ and ‘Acknowledge’ signals are used in self-timed logic. A static logic family,
called ‘‘event logic,’’ can also be designed while using these signal edges for which these edges are the only
events of interest.11 There are two different protocols, i.e., the two phases (for which a rising edge has the same
signiﬁcance as a falling edge) and the four phases protocol (for which only the rising edge is taken into account
while the falling edge means only reset).
Library Cells for Cryptographic Applications
ASICs for smart cards can be attacked by differential power attacks (DPA) that consist of tracing the power
consumption and identifying operations that are data dependent after removal of the power consumption that
is data independent. In this way, secret keys could be obtained. Consequently, DPA-resistant circuits will be of
crucial importance in the future. DPA was demonstrated in 1999.23 It has been shown that it is possible to
examine the power consumed by the circuit when processing data or executing instructions. By analyzing the
variation in power consumption and the data processed, an attacker can discover the secure information being
processed and the keys hidden in the circuit. The attacker can analyze a single power trace (SPA) or can
perform a statistical analysis of many collected power traces (DPA). These power traces will provide an average
power trace that represents the data-independent power trace. By having a given power trace with a given
hidden key, the attacker can subtract the average power trace and determine the difference that represents only
the data-dependent power. By comparing the difference to the simulated power traces, the attacker can quite
easily deduce what is the secure key of the considered circuit.
The DPA attack is based on the fact that executed operations or instructions present power consumption
that is data dependent. A very general goal is to ﬁnd circuit implementations that are not sensitive to operands
regarding the power. Some circuit techniques, such as current steering logic or dual-rail DCVSL logic, are
known to be less data dependent. Self-timed logic does not have a global clock, so there is not a global timing
signal for use as a reference and the analysis and correlation of power traces of power consumption are more
difﬁcult.24 It is difﬁcult to determine when an operation or instruction starts and stops. However, as power
issues are crucial for smart cards, these logic families do not meet this requirement. Furthermore, recent
research has revealed weaknesses in the basic DCVSL scheme and suggested improvements.25 In dual-rail
DCVSL logic, parasitic capacitances are different in the two N-ch networks implementing the dual Boolean
functions and, therefore, the power consumption too. A new SABL logic family is introduced in Ref. [25],
based on the fact that the output will charge the same capacitance for each clock, even if the output transition
is 1–1 or 0–0. This SABL logic is based on the differential StrongArm SAFF Flip-Flop; it consumes, however,
twice the power of static CMOS.
Leakage Reduction at Architecture Level
Many techniques have been proposed to reduce the leakage power, such as multi-VT technologies, gated Vdd,
DTMOS, and static and dynamic SATS.26 These techniques are effective at the cost of more or less complex
circuits or technologies. Another technique already proposed is weak inversion logic for which transistors
work in the weak inversion regime. Despite the use of these techniques, reducing static power in very deep
4-50
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

submicron technologies has to be addressed at all design levels, including systems and architecture levels. This
section addresses this problem at the architecture level.
Activity, Logic Depth, and Number of Gates
By analyzing the ratio of dynamic over static power, it is observable that circuits presenting a low or very low
activity will present a too large static power compared to dynamic power. Performing a logic function with a
very small activity can be considered far from the optimum, as the circuit is idle most of the time. In other
words, if a transistor or a logic gate is not switching for a very long period, it is not very efﬁcient, as the ratio
between the switching time (related to dynamic power) and the idle time (for which the transistor or the logic
gate is leaky) is very small. It is obviously the case when the circuit is in sleep mode, as no dynamic power is
present. Hence, the only consumed power is the static one. However, in that case, nothing can be done at the
architecture level and only circuit techniques26 can be used to reduce leakage.
The presented design methodology aims at searching for an optimum in which one has better use of
switching transistors or gates in the reference period of time, i.e., an increased activity in such a way that
dynamic power is not too small compared to static power. Obviously, this relative increase in activity has to be
understood as useful and not, for instance, by suppressing gated clocks or increasing glitches.
The conventional deﬁnition of activity is the factor a in the dynamic power formula P ¼ a · f · C ·
Vdd2. It means that a is the ratio between the number of switching gates in a clock period over the total
number of gates. Combinational circuits generally present activities around 1 to 5%. One has also to consider
idle gates when they are connected in series. If there are 20 gates in series for a given pipeline stage or logic
block (logic depth [LD] ¼ 20), these 20 gates have to switch in series in a clock period. So only 1/20 of the
clock period is used for the switching of a given gate; the rest of the time the considered gate is only a leaky
gate. In running modes, with more and more leaky transistors, it seems that it would be better to avoid
designing very inactive gates and therefore to search for an optimum ratio of dynamic power over static power.
Leakage energy could be considered roughly proportional to the number of gates and to the duration of the
clock period. It is not the case of the dynamic energy which is only proportional to the number of switching
gates. To have a better balance of dynamic versus static energy, it could be mandatory to decrease signiﬁcantly
the total number of gates, resulting in an increase in global activity.
Optimal Total Power
This optimum of the total power (dynamicþstatic) is roughly obtained with similar amounts of static and
dynamic power.27,28 To reduce the total power consumption, an attractive goal could be to have fewer but
more active transistors or gates to perform the same logic function. If a given logic function requires 10,000
gates for its implementation and presents an activity factor of 1%, this means that, on average, 100 gates are
switching in a clock period. If the same logic function could be implemented with only 1000 gates, keeping the
same number of switching gates (100), the activity will be 10%, with the same dynamic power but with a
leakage reduced by a factor of 10 due to the reduction in the total number of gates.29
Figure 4.52 (left) shows such a theoretical situation with the same dynamic power and a signiﬁcantly
reduced leakage power for the architecture containing fewer gates. This is, however, a naive situation as
nothing is said about the speed of the two architectures. The architecture with the smaller number of gates
could be slower and would therefore require a larger Vdd to achieve the same speed, impacting dynamic
and static power.
Figure 4.52 (right) shows a practical situation comparing a 16 · 16 multiplier automatically synthesized
with a logic synthesizer according to two different architectures. The architecture A is realized with four RCA
multipliers working in parallel (3250 gates) and a second architecture B is implemented with two Wallace
multipliers working in parallel (1960 gates). Both present 208 transitions for executing a 16 · 16 multiply
(3250 gates · 6.4% ¼ 1960 gates · 10.6% ¼ 208 transitions), showing that various architectures with a
quite different number of gates can achieve their function with the same number of transitions. The
architecture B (second bar, at same Vdd and VT) with fewer gates than A presents a larger activity, a smaller
leakage, but also a smaller dynamic power (less sized transistors, due to improved delay slack). However, at the
optimum of the total power consumption, this architecture B can be supplied with smaller Vdd and VT

(third bar) to meet the same speed performances as A, with better results in total power consumption. This
shows, however, that the speed performances are a very important parameter in such comparisons.
The goal of designing architectures with more global activity is not only to reduce leakage power with same
dynamic power (Figure 4.52, left), but also to ﬁnd an optimum of the total power, as shown in Figure 4.52
(right). This optimum has to be searched for the same speed constraints; and looking at ﬁrst and last bars of
Figure 4.52 (right) architecture B with fewer gates and more activity is better in terms of optimal total power,
however, with a similar ratio of dynamic over static power of, respectively, 3.2 for A and 2.5 for B. This
example shows very clearly that the reduction in the total number of gates and the increase in the activity
could result in the same or even smaller dynamic power and optimal total power. It is the paradigm shift, not
increasing the number of switching gates, but reducing the total number of gates. In this respect, the resulting
activity although increased, can be considered as useful activity. However, as already pointed out, the
reduction in the total number of gates and the increase in the activity cannot be a goal per se, as some
architectures for a given logic function with signiﬁcantly fewer gates could be extremely slow. So one has to
dramatically increase the supply voltage and decrease the VT to satisfy the speed constraints, resulting in a
much larger total power. It could be the case, for instance, for a sequential multiplier using add-shift
mechanism compared to a parallel multiplier.
Design Methodologies Based on Optimal Total Power
In Ref. [30], it is shown that at optimal total power, the ratio Ion/Ioff of a single device in a given technology is
proportional to K1 · (LD/a), i.e., proportional to architectural parameters such as logic depth (LD) and
activity (a). K1 is not ﬁxed as shown in Ref. [31] and Ref. [32], but goes from three to six depending on the
architecture. Dynamic over static power is also equal to K1, i.e., dynamic power is three to six times larger than
static power at the optimum of the total power. It turns out that Ion/Ioff is quite low in very deep submicron
technologies, showing that leakage-tolerant architectures do have to present small LD and large activities.
So pipelined architectures, reducing LD proportionally to the number of stages with the same activity
(Figure 4.41), have to be preferred to parallel architectures (Figure 4.42) that reduce LD and activity. In other
words, parallel architectures do reduce LD, but the transistor count is also largely increased, impacting too
much on the number of inactive gates and therefore the leakage.
Obviously, what is searched for is a design methodology starting from a given logic function architecture
and generating a new architecture in which the number of cells is reduced, the number of transitions for this
given logic function is constant, the activity is increased, but LD is also constant (or even smaller). If LD is
increased, as is generally the case by increasing sequencing to reduce the gate count, then the speed constraints

shows such an example, i.e., architecture B (Wallace parallelized twice) is much better than architecture A
(RCA parallelized four times), as the former (B) has fewer gates, the same number of transitions, increased
activity, and furthermore even a smaller LD.

Introduction
This chapter on surface mount technology (SMT) will familiarize the reader with the process steps in a
successful SMT design. Being successful with the implementation of SMT means the engineers involved must
commit to the principles of concurrent engineering. It also means that a continuing commitment to a quality
technique is necessary, whether that is Taguchi, TQM, SPC, DOE, another technique, or a combination of
several quality techniques, lest you too have quality problems with SMT (Figure 5.1).
5.2
Deﬁnition and Considerations
SMT is a collection of scientiﬁc and engineering methods needed to design, build, and test products made
with electronic components that mount to the surface of the printed circuit board (PCB) without holes for
leads (Higgins, 1991). This deﬁnition notes the breadth of topics necessary to understand SMT, and also clearly
says that the successful implementation of SMT will require the use of concurrent engineering (Shina, 1991;
Classon, 1993). Concurrent engineering means that a team of design, manufacturing, test, and marketing
people will concern themselves with board layout, parts and parts placement issues, soldering, cleaning, test,
rework, and packaging before any product is made. The careful control of all these issues improves both yield
and reliability of the ﬁnal product. In fact, SMT cannot be reasonably implemented without the use of
concurrent engineering and/or the principles contained in design for manufacturability (DFM) and design
5-1

for testability (DFT), and therefore any facility that has not
embraced these principles should do so if implementation
of SMT is its goal.
Considerations in the Implementation
of SMT
Main reasons to consider implementation of SMT include:
. Reduction in circuit board size
. Reduction in circuit board weight
. Reduction in number of layers in the circuit board
. Reduction in trace lengths on the circuit board,
with correspondingly shorter signal transit times
and potentially higher-speed operation
Not all these reductions may occur in any given product redesign from through-hole technology (THT) to
SMT. Variations in considerations for manufacturing and testing will affect the reductions possible.
Most companies that have not converted to SMT are considering doing so. All is of course not golden in
SMT Land. During the assembly of a through-hole board, either the component leads go through the holes or
they do not, and the component placement machines can typically detect the difference in force involved.
During SMT board assembly, the placement machine does not have such direct feedback, and the accuracy of
ﬁnal soldered placement becomes a stochastic (probability-based) process dependent on such items as
component pad design, accuracy of the PCB artwork, and fabrication which affects the accuracy of pad
location, accuracy of solder paste deposition location and deposition volume, accuracy of adhesive deposition
location and volume if adhesive is used, accuracy of placement machine vision systems, variations in
component sizes from the assumed sizes, and thermal issues in the solder reﬂow process. In THT tests, there is
a through-hole at every potential test point, making it easy to align a bed-of-nails tester. In SMT designs, there
are not holes corresponding to every device lead. DFT principles must be followed to create testable products.
The design team must also consider form, ﬁt, and function, time-to-market, existing capabilities, testing,
rework capabilities, and the cost and time to characterize a new process when deciding on a change of
technologies.

Once circuit design is complete, substrate design and fabrication, most commonly of a PCB, enters the
process. Generally, PCB assembly conﬁgurations using surface mount devices (SMDs) are classiﬁed as shown
in Figure 5.2. While the IPC has further subclassiﬁcations of SMT assembly types, these three basic deﬁnitions
serve for most assemblies.

. Type I—only SMDs are used, typically on both sides of the board. No through-hole components are
used. Top and bottom may contain both large and small active and passive SMDs. This type of board
uses reﬂow soldering only.
. Type II—a double-sided board, with SMDs on both sides. The top side may have all sizes of active and
passive SMDs, as well as through-hole components, while the bottom side carries passive SMDs and
small active components such as transistors. This type of board requires both reﬂow and wave
soldering, and will require placement of bottom-side SMDs in adhesive.
. Type III—the top side has only through-hole components, which may be active and/or passive, while
the bottom side has passive and small active SMDs. This type of board uses wave soldering only, and
also requires placement of the bottom-side SMDs in adhesive. It should be noted that with the ongoing
increase in usage of various techniques to place IC dice directly on circuit boards, Type III in some
articles means a mix of packaged SMT ICs and bare die on the same board.
A Type I bare board will ﬁrst have solder paste applied to the component pads on the board. Once solder
paste has been deposited, active and passive parts are placed in the paste. For prototype and low-volume lines,
this can be done with manually guided XY tables using vacuum needles to hold the components, while in
medium- and high-volume lines automated placement equipment is used. This equipment will pick parts
from reels, sticks, or trays, then place the components at the appropriate pad locations on the board; hence the
term ‘‘pick and place’’ equipment.
After all parts are placed in the solder paste, the entire assembly enters a reﬂow oven to raise the temperature of
the assembly high enough to reﬂow the solder paste and create acceptable solder joints at the component lead/
pad transitions. As discussed in more detail in Reﬂow International’s Reﬂow Technology Handbook, reﬂow ovens
most commonly use convection and IR heat sources to heat the assembly above the point of solder liquidus,
which for 63/37 tin-lead eutectic solder is 183–C. Because of the much higher thermal conductivity of the solder
paste compared to the IC body, reﬂow soldering temperatures are reached at the leads/pads before the IC chip
itself reaches damaging temperatures. The board is inverted and the process repeated.
The move to lead-free solder will require higher reﬂow temperatures, with increasing concerns about
potential damage to both substrates and components. Lead-free solder is discussed later in this chapter.
If mixed-technology Type II is being produced, the board will ﬁrst go through the Type I reﬂow process,
then be inverted, an adhesive will be dispensed at the centroid of each SMD, parts placed, the adhesive cured,
the assembly rerighted, through-hole components mounted, and the circuit assembly will then be wave-
soldered which will create acceptable solder joints for both the through-hole components and bottom-side
SMDs.
A Type III board will ﬁrst be inverted, adhesive dispensed, SMDs placed on the bottom side of the board, the
adhesive cured, the board rerighted, through-hole components placed, and the entire assembly wave-soldered.
It is imperative to note that only passive components and small active SMDs can be successfully bottom-side
wave-soldered without considerable experience on the part of the design team and the board assembly facility.
It must also be noted that successful wave soldering of SMDs requires a dual-wave machine with one turbulent
wave and one laminar wave.
It is common for a manufacturer of through-hole boards to convert ﬁrst to a Type II or Type III substrate
design before going to an all-SMD Type I design. This is especially true if amortization of through-hole
insertion and wave-soldering equipment is necessary. Many factors contribute to the reality that most boards
are mixed-technology Type II or Type III boards. While most components are available in SMT packages,
through-hole connectors are still commonly used for the additional strength the through-hole soldering
process provides, and high-power devices such as three-terminal regulators are still commonly through-hole
due to off-board heat-sinking demands. Both of these issues are addressed by manufacturers, and solutions
exist which allow Type I boards with connectors and power devices.
With regard to Type II and Type III boards and the use of wave soldering, be certain to consult with all
component manufacturers of any SMT components that will be placed on the wave-solder side of the
assembly. For example, while some IC manufacturers allow their smaller ICs to be wave soldered, others do
not recommend that any of their ICs be subjected to the wave-solder process.

Again, it is imperative that all members of the design, build, and test teams be involved from the design
stage. Today’s complex board designs mean that it is entirely possible to exceed the ability to adequately test a
board if the test is not designed-in, or to robustly manufacture the board if in-line inspections and handling
are not adequately considered. Robustness of both test and manufacturing are only assured with full
involvement of all parties to overall board design and production.
It cannot be overemphasized that the speed with which packaging issues are moving requires anyone
involved in SMT board or assembly issues to stay current and continue to learn about the processes. Subscribe
to one or more of the industry-oriented journals noted in the ‘‘Further Information’’ section at the end of this
chapter, obtain any IC industry references, and purchase several SMT reference books.
5.4
SMD Deﬁnitions
The new user of SMDs must rapidly learn the packaging sizes and types for SMDs. Resistors, capacitors, and
most other passive devices come in two-terminal packages that have end-terminations designed to rest on
substrate pads/lands (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3).
SMD ICs come in a wide variety of packages, from eight-pin small outline packages (SOLs) to 1000þ
connection packages in a variety of sizes and lead conﬁgurations, as shown in Figure 5.3. The most common
commercial packages currently include plastic leaded chip carriers (PLCCs), SOLs quad ﬂat packs (QFPs),
and plastic quad ﬂat packs (PQFPs). Add in tape automated bonding (TAB), ball grid array (BGA), and other
newer technologies, and the IC possibilities become overwhelming. Space prevents examples of all these
technologies from being included here. The reader is referred to the standards of the Institute for
Interconnecting and Packaging Electronic Circuits (IPC) to ﬁnd the latest package standards, and to the
proceedings of the most recent APEX, NEPCON, SMTAI, and other conferences for information on industry
uses of the latest SMT packages. A good overview of package styles is found in packaging handbooks from
various manufacturers, including Intel and National Semiconductor.
Each IC manufacturer’s data books will have packaging information for their products. Shown in Figure 5.4
are two of the many SMT IC plastic packages.
The engineer should be familiar with the term ‘‘lead pitch,’’ which means the center-to-center distance
between IC leads. Pitch may be in thousandths of an inch, also known as mils, or in millimeters. Common
pitches are 0.050 in. (50 mil pitch), 0.025 in. (25 mil pitch) frequently called ‘‘ﬁne pitch,’’ and 0.020 in. and
smaller, frequently called ‘‘ultra-ﬁne pitch.’’ Metric equivalents are 1.27 mm, 0.635 mm, and 0.508 mm and
smaller. Conversions from metric to inches are easily approximated if one remembers that 1 mm
approximately equals 40 mils. Do remember that this approximation is ﬁne for ‘‘back-of-the-envelope’’
designs, but for actual designs exact conversions must be performed.
For process control, design teams must consider the minimum and maximum package size variations
allowed by their part suppliers, the moisture content of parts as-received, and the relative robustness of each
FIGURE 5.3

lead type. Incoming inspection should consist of both electrical and mechanical tests. Whether these are spot
checks, lot checks, or no checks will depend on the relationship with the vendor.
5.5
Substrate Design Guidelines
As noted previously, substrate (typically PCB) design has an effect not only on board/component layout, but
also on the actual manufacturing process. Incorrect land design or layout can negatively affect the placement
process, the solder process, the test process, or any combination of the three. Substrate design must take into
account the mix of SMDs that are available for use in manufacturing.
The considerations noted here as part of the design process are neither all-encompassing, nor in sufﬁcient
detail for a true SMT novice to adequately deal with all the issues involved in the process. They are intended to
guide an engineer through the process, allowing the engineer to access more detailed information as necessary.
General references are noted at the end of this chapter, and speciﬁc references will be noted as applicable.
Although these guidelines are noted as ‘‘steps,’’ they are not necessarily in an absolute order, and may require
several iterations back-and-forth among the steps to result in a ﬁnal satisfactory process and product.
After the circuit design (schematic capture) and analysis, Step 1 in the process is to determine whether all
SMDs will be used in the ﬁnal design making a Type I board, or whether a mix of SMDs and through-hole
parts will be used, leading to a Type II or Type III board. This decision will be governed by some or all of the
following considerations:
. Current parts stock
. Existence of current through-hole placement and wave solder equipment
. Amortization of current through-hole placement and solder equipment
. Existence of reﬂow soldering equipment or cost of new reﬂow soldering equipment
. Desired size of the ﬁnal product
. Panelization of smaller Type I boards
. Thermal issues related to high power circuit sections on the board
It may be desirable to segment the board into areas based on function: RF, low power, high power, etc.,
using all SMDs where appropriate, and mixed-technology components as needed. Any RF designs will ﬁnd
Howard Johnson’s book of value. Power and connector portions of the circuit may point to the use of

through-hole components, although as mentioned both these issues are being addressed by circuit board
material and connector manufacturers. Using one solder technique (reﬂow or wave) simpliﬁes processing and
may outweigh other considerations.
Step 2 in the SMT process is to deﬁne all the footprints of the SMDs under consideration for use in the
design. The footprint is the copper pattern or ‘‘land,’’ on the circuit board upon which the SMD will be
placed. Footprint examples are shown in Figure 5.5, and footprint recommendations are available from IC
manufacturers and in the appropriate data books. They are also available in various ECAD packages used
for the design process, or in several references that include an overview of the SMT process. However,
thereader is seriously cautioned about using the general references for anything other than the most
common passive and active packages. Even the position of pin 1 may be different among IC
manufacturers of the ‘‘same’’ chip. The footprint deﬁnition may also include the position of the solder
resist pattern surrounding the copper pattern. Footprint deﬁnition sizing will vary depending on whether
reﬂow or wave solder process is used. Wave-solder footprints will require recognition of the direction of
travel of the board through the wave to minimize solder shadowing in the ﬁnal ﬁllet, as well as
requirements for solder thieves. The copper footprint must allow for the formation of an appropriate,
inspectable solder ﬁllet.
If done as part of the EDA process (electronic design automation, using appropriate electronic CAD
software), the software will automatically assign copper directions to each component footprint, as well as
appropriate coordinates and dimensions. These may need adjustment based on considerations related to
wave soldering, test points, RF and/or power issues, and board production limitations. Allowing the
software to select 5 mil traces when the board production facility to be used can only reliably do 10 mil
traces would be inappropriate. Likewise, the solder resist patterns must be governed by the production
capabilities.
Final footprint and trace decisions will:
. Allow for optimal solder ﬁllet formation
. Minimize necessary trace and footprint area
. Allow for adequate test points
. Minimize board area, if appropriate
. Set minimum interpart clearances for placement and test equipment to safely access the board
(Figure 5.6)
. Allow adequate distance between components for post-reﬂow operator inspections
. Allow room for adhesive dots on wave-soldered boards
. Minimize solder bridging

Surface Mount Technology

Decisions that will provide optimal footprints include a number of issues, including:
. Component dimension tolerances
. Board production capabilities, both artwork and physical tolerances across the board relative to a 0–0
ﬁducial
. How much artwork/board shrink or stretch is allowable
. Solder deposition volume consistencies with respect to ﬁllet sizes
. Placement machine accuracies
. Test probe location controls and bed-of-nails grid pitch
Design teams should restrict wave-solder-side SMDs to passive components and transistors. While small
SMT ICs can be successfully wave-soldered, this is inappropriate for an initial SMT design, and is not
recommended by some IC manufacturers.
Certain design decisions may require a statistical computer program, if available, to the design team. The
stochastic nature of the overall process suggests a statistical programmer will be of value.
5.6
Thermal Design Considerations
Thermal management issues remain major concerns in the successful design of an SMT board and product.
Consideration must be taken of the variables affecting both board temperature and junction temperature of
the IC. The reader is referred to other chapters in this Handbook for the basics of thermal management, and to
Bar-Cohen and Kraus (1988) for a more detailed treatment on thermal issues affecting ICs and PCB design.
The design team must understand the basic heat transfer characteristics of most SMT IC packages (Capillo,
1993). Since the silicon chip of an SMD is equivalent to the chip in an identical-function DIP package, the
smaller SMD package means the internal lead frame metal has a smaller mass than the lead frame in a DIP
package. This lesser ability to conduct heat away from the chip is somewhat offset by the leadframe of many
SMDs being constructed of copper, which has a lower thermal resistance than the Kovar and Alloy 42 materials
commonly used for DIP packages. However, with less metal and shorter lead lengths to transfer heat to
ambient air, more heat is typically transferred to the circuit board itself. Since all electronics components
generate heat in use, and elevated temperatures negatively affect the reliability and failure rate of
FIGURE 5.6

semiconductors, it is important that heat generated by SMDs be removed as efﬁciently as possible. The design
team needs to have expertise with the variables related to thermal transfer:
. Junction temperature: Tj
. Thermal resistances: Yjc, Yca, Ycs, Ysa
. Temperature sensitive parameter (TSP) method of determining Ys
. Power dissipation: PD
. Thermal characteristics of substrate material
Power SMT packages have been developed to maximize heat transfer to the substrate. These include PLCCs
with integral heat spreaders, the SOT-89 power transistor package, theDPAKpower transistor package, andmany
others. Note that all of these devices are designed primarily for processing with the solder paste process, and some
speciﬁcally recommend against their use with wave-solder applications. Heat sinks and heat pipes could also be
considered for high-power ICs. Excellent references for thermal issues are the monthly publications Electronics
Cooling, www.electoronics-cooling.com, and Cooling Zone’s online magazine, www.coolingzone.com. Several
board thermal analysis software packages are available and are highly recommended for boards that are expected
to develop high thermal gradients. Their advertisements can be found on the two web sites just mentioned.
In the conduction process, heat is transferred from one element to another by direct physical contact
between the elements. Ideally the material to which heat is being transferred should not be adversely affected
by the transfer. As an example, the glass-transition temperature Tg of FR-4 is 125–C. Heat transferred to the
board has little or no detrimental effect as long as the board temperature stays at least 50–C below Tg. Good
heat sink materials exhibit high thermal conductivity, which is not a characteristic of ﬁberglass. Therefore, the
traces must be depended on to provide the thermal transfer path (Choi et al., 1994; Brooks, 1998). Conductive
heat transfer is also used in the transfer of heat from IC packages to heat sinks, which also requires use of
thermal grease to ﬁll all air gaps between the package and the ‘‘ﬂat’’ surface of the sink.
The previous discussion of lead properties of course does not apply to leadless devices such as leadless
ceramic chip carriers (LCCCs). Design teams using these and similar packages must understand the better heat
transfer properties of the alumina used in ceramic packages, and must match TCEs between the LCCC and the
substrate, since there are no leads to bend and absorb mismatches of expansion.
Since the heat transfer properties of the system depend on substrate material properties, it is necessary to
understand several of the characteristics of the most common substrate material, FR-4 ﬁberglass. The glass-
transition temperature has already been noted, and board designers must also understand that multilayer FR-4
boards do not expand identically in the X-, Y-, and Z-directions as temperature increases. Plated-through-
holes will constrain Z-axis expansion in their immediate board areas, while non-through-hole areas will
expand further in the Z-axis, particularly as the temperature approaches and exceeds Tg (Lee et al., 1984;
Prasad, 1997). This unequal expansion can cause delamination of layers and plating fracture.
If the design team knows that there will be a need for higher abilities to dissipate heat and/or a need for
higher glass transition temperatures and lower coefﬁcients of thermal expansion (TCE) than FR-4 possesses,
many other materials are available, as discussed in Hollomon (1995) and Prasad (1997).
Note in Table 5.1 that copper-clad Invar has both variable Tg and variable thermal conductivity, depending on
the volume mix of copper and Invar in the substrate. Copper has a high TCE and Invar has a low TCE, so the TCE
increases with the thickness of the copper layers. In addition to heat transfer considerations, board material
decisions must also be based on the expected vibration, stress, and humidity in the application.
Convective heat transfer involves transfer due to the motion of molecules, typically airﬂow over a heat
sink, and depends on the relative temperatures of the two media involved. It also depends on the velocity of
air ﬂow over the boundary layer of the heat sink. Convective heat transfer primarily occurs when forced
air ﬂow is provided across a substrate, and when convection effects are maximized through the use of heat
sinks. The rules that designers are familiar with when designing THT heat-sink device designs also apply to
SMT design.
The design team must consider whether passive conduction and convection will be adequate to cool a
populated substrate, or whether forced-air cooling or liquid cooling will be needed. Passive conductive
cooling is enhanced with thermal layers in the substrate, such as the previously mentioned copper/Invar.
5-9
Surface Mount Technology

There will also be designs that will rely on the traditional through-hole device with heat sink to maximize
heat transfer. An example of this would be the typical three-terminal voltage regulator mounted on a heat
sink or directly to a metal chassis for heat conduction, for which standard calculations apply (Lee et al.,
1993).
Many speciﬁc examples of heat transfer may need to be considered in board design, and of course most
examples involve both conductive and convective transfer. For example, the air gap between the bottom of a
standard SMD and the board affects the thermal resistance from the case to ambient, Yca. A wider gap
will result in a higher resistance, due to poorer convective transfer, whereas ﬁlling the gap with a thermally
conductive epoxy will lower the resistance by increasing conductive heat transfer (Blackwell, 2000). Thermal-
modeling software is the best way to deal with these types of issues, due to the need for rigorous application of
computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD).
5.7
Adhesives
In the surface mount assembly process, Type II and Type III boards will always require adhesive to mount
the SMDs for passage through the solder wave. This is apparent when one envisions components on the
bottom side of the substrate with no through-hole leads to hold them in place. Adhesives will stay in
place after the soldering process and throughout the life of the substrate and the product, since there is
no convenient means of adhesive removal once the solder process is complete. This means the adhesive
used must meet a number of both physical and chemical characteristics that should be considered
during the three phases of adhesive use in SMT production: pre-application properties relating to
storage and dispensing issues, curing properties relating to time and temperature needed for cure, and
post-curing properties relating to ﬁnal strength, mechanical stability, and reworkability. Among these
characteristics are:
. Electrically nonconductive
. Thermal coefﬁcient of expansion similar to the substrate and the components
. Stable in both storage and after application, prior to curing
. Stable physical drop shape—retains drop height and ﬁlls Z-axis distance between the board and the
bottom of the component; thixotropic with no adhesive migration
. Noncorrosive to substrate and component materials
. Chemically inert to ﬂux, solder, and cleaning materials used in the process
. Curable as appropriate to the process: UV, oven, or air-cure
. Removable for rework and repair
. Once cured, unaffected by temperatures in the solder process
. Adhesive color, for easy identiﬁcation by operators

One-part adhesives are easier to work with than two-part adhesives because an additional process step is not
required. The user must verify that the adhesive has sufﬁcient shelf life and pot life for the user’s perceived
process requirements. Both epoxy and acrylic adhesives are available as one- or two-part systems, and must be
cured thermally. Generally, epoxy adhesives are cured by oven-heating, while acrylics may be formulated to be
cured by long-wave UV light or heat.
Adhesive can be applied by screening techniques similar to solder paste screen application, by pin-transfer
techniques, and by syringe deposition. Screen and pin-transfer techniques are suitable for high-volume
production lines with few product changes over time. Syringe deposition using an X–Y table riding over the
board with a volumetric pump and syringe tip is more suitable for lines with a varying product mix, prototype
lines, and low-volume lines where the open containers of adhesive necessary in pin-transfer and screen
techniques are avoided. Newer syringe systems are capable of handling high-volume lines. See Figure 5.8 for
methods of adhesive deposition, which include stenciling and syringe deposition. If Type II or Type III
assemblies are used, and thermal transfer between components and the substrate is a concern, the design team
should consider thermally conductive adhesives.
Regardless of the type of assembly, the type of adhesive used, or the curing technique used, adhesive volume
and height must be carefully controlled. Slump of adhesive after application is undesirable because the
adhesive must stay high enough to solidly contact the bottom of the component, and must not spread and
contaminate any pad associated with the component.
If adhesive dot height ¼ X, substrate metal height ¼ Y, and SMD termination thickness ¼ Z, then X . Y þ Z,
allowing for all combinations of potential errors, e.g., end termination min and max thickness, adhesive dot min
and max height, and substrate metal min and max height.
Typically, end termination thickness variations are available from the part manufacturer. Solder pad
thickness variations are a result of the board manufacturing process, and will vary not only with the type of
board metalization (standard etch vs. plated-through-hole) but also with the variations within each type. For
adequate dot height, which will allow for some dot compression by the part, X should be between 1.5X and
2.5X of the total Y þ Z, or just Z when dummy tracks are used. If adhesive dots are placed on masked areas of
the board, mask thickness must also be considered.
A common variation on the above design is to place ‘‘dummy’’ copper pads under the center of the part.
Since these pads are etched and plated at the same time as the actual solder pads, the variation in metal height
Y is eliminated as an issue. Adhesive dots are placed on the dummy pads and X . Z is the primary concern.
Adhesive dispensing quality issues are addressed by considerations of:
. Type of adhesive to be used
. Process-area ambient temperature and humidity
. Incoming quality control
. No voids in cured adhesive to prevent trapping of ﬂux, dirt, etc.
. Volume control
. Location control
As shown in Figure 5.7, all combinations of termination, dot, and substrate height/thickness must be
considered. Prasad (1997) has an excellent in-depth discussion of adhesives in SMT production.

5.8
Solder Paste and Joint Formation
Solder joint formation is the culmination of the entire process. Regardless of the quality of the design or
any other single portion of the process, if high-quality reliable solder joints are not formed, the ﬁnal product is
not reliable. It is at this point that ppm levels take on their ﬁnest meaning. For a medium-size substrate (nominal
6 in. · 8 in.), with a medium density of components, a typical mix of active and passive parts on the topside and
only passive and three- or four-terminal active parts on bottom side, there may be in excess of 1000 solder joints
per board. If solder joints are manufactured at the 3 sigma level (99.73% good joints, 0.27% defect rate, or 2700
defects per one million joints), there will be 2.7 defects per board! At the 6 sigma level, of 3.4 ppm, there will be a
defect on one board out of every 294 boards produced. If your anticipated production level is 1000 units per day,
you will have 3.4 rejects based solely on solder joint problems, not counting other sources of defects.
Solder paste may be deposited by syringe, or by screen or stencil printing techniques. Stencil techniques are
best for high-volume/speed production although they do require a speciﬁc stencil for each board design.

Syringe and screen techniques may be used for high-volume lines, and are also suited to mixed-product lines
where only small volumes of a given board design are to have solder paste deposited. Syringe deposition is the
only solder paste technique that can be used on boards that already have some components mounted. It is also
well suited for prototype lines and for any use requires only software changes to develop a different deposition
pattern.
Solder joint defects have many possible origins:
. Poor or inconsistent solder paste quality
. Inappropriate solder pad design/shape/size/trace connections
. Substrate artwork or production problems, e.g., mismatch of copper and mask, warped substrate
. Solder paste deposition problems, e.g., wrong volume or location
. Component lead problems, e.g., poor coplanarity or poor tinning of leads
. Placement errors, e.g., part rotation or X–Y offsets
. Reﬂow proﬁle, e.g., preheat ramp too fast or too slow; wrong temperatures created on substrate
. Board handling problems, e.g., boards getting jostled prior to reﬂow
Once again, a complete discussion of all of the potential problems that can affect solder joint formation is
beyond the scope of this chapter. Many references are available that address these issues. An excellent overview
of solder joint formation theory is found in Lau and Pau (1996). Updated information on this and all SMT
topics is available each year at conferences, such as APEX, SMTAI, and NEPCON.
While commonly used solder paste for both THT and SMT production contains 63/37 eutectic tin-lead
solder, other metal formulations are available, including 62/36/2 Sn/Pb/Ag and 96/4 Sn/Ag (aka silver solder).
The ﬂuxes available include rosin mildly activated (RMA), water-soluble, and no-clean. The correct decision
rests as much on the choice of ﬂux as it does on the proper metal mixture. A solder paste supplier can best
advise on solder pastes for speciﬁc needs.
Many studies have been done and are in process to determine an optimal no-lead replacement for lead-
based solder in commercial electronic assemblies. The design should investigate the current status of these
studies as well as the status of no-lead legislation as part of the decision-making process.
The major concern leading to the implementation of lead-free assembly stems not from the
assembly process itself but from the leaching of heavy metals out of electronic assemblies that are discarded in
landﬁlls. Banning of electronics assemblies from landﬁlls has already started, as Sioux Falls, South Dakota has
banned electronics assemblies from its landﬁll. Other cities and states are considering similar legislation.
No-lead legislation in the European Community now exists, requiring the phased elimination of lead-
bearing materials (as well as others) over the 2005–2010 timeframe. While there is no current U.S.A. federal
legislation, designers and manufacturers who want to maintain an EU market must prepare for the transition.
As Bradley et al. (2003) report, the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (NEMI) has now
recommended that alloys of tin, silver, and copper be used in the lead-free process. This alloy mix appears to
also be gaining acceptance in Europe and Japan. The major process drawback to this mix is that the reﬂow
temperatures will rise approximately 35 to 40–C. This temperature rise will require careful consideration of the
effects on both substrate materials and component survival. Apell discusses these and other lead-free reﬂow
considerations.
To better understand solder joint formation, one must understand the make-up of solder paste used for
SMT soldering. The solder paste consists of microscopic balls of solder, most commonly tin-lead with the
accompanying oxide ﬁlm, ﬂux, and activator and thickener solvents as shown in Figure 5.9.
The ﬂuxes are an integral part of the solder paste, and are discussed further in Section ‘‘Cleaning’’. RMA,
water-soluble, and no-clean ﬂux/pastes are available. An issue directly related to ﬂuxes, cleaning, and ﬁne-
pitch components (25 mil pitch and less) is reﬂowing in an inert environment. Inert gas blanketing the oven
markedly reduces the development of oxides in the elevated temperatures present. Oxide reduction needs are
greater with the smaller metal balls in paste designed for ﬁne-pitch parts because there is more surface area on
which oxides can form. No-clean ﬂuxes are not as active as other ﬂuxes and therefore have a lesser ability to
reduce the oxides formed on both the paste metal and substrate metalizations. Inerting the oven tends to solve
these problems. However, it brings with it control issues that must be considered.
5-13
Surface Mount Technology

Regardless of the supplier, frequent solder paste tests are advisable, especially if the solder is stored
for prolonged periods before use. As a minimum, viscosity, percent metal, and solder sphere formation should
be tested (Capillo, 1990). Solder sphere formation is particularly important because acceptable particle sizes
will vary depending on the pitch of the smallest-pitch part to be used, and the consistency of solder sphere
formation will affect the quality of the ﬁnal solder joint. Round solder spheres have the smallest surface area
for a given volume. Therefore, they will have the least amount of oxide formation. Uneven distribution of
sphere sizes within a given paste can lead to uneven heating during the reﬂow process, with the result that the
unwanted solder balls will be expelled from the overall paste mass at a given pad/lead site. Fine-pitch paste has
smaller ball sizes and consequently more surface area on which oxides can form.
It should be noted at this point that there are three distinctly different ‘‘solder balls’’ referred to in this
chapter and in publications discussing SMT. The solder sphere test refers to the ability of a volume of solder
to form a ball shape due to its inherent surface tension when reﬂowed (melted) on a nonwettable surface.
This ball formation is dependent on minimum oxides on the microscopic metal balls that make up the
paste—the second type of ‘‘solder ball.’’ It is also dependent on the ability of the ﬂux to reduce the oxides that
are present, as well the ramp-up of temperature during the preheat and drying phases of the reﬂow oven
proﬁle. Too steep a time/temperature slope can cause rapid escape of entrapped volatile solvents, resulting in
expulsion of small amounts of metal that will form undesirable ‘‘solder balls’’ of the third type, small metal
balls scattered around the solder joints on the substrate itself rather than on the tinned metal of the joint. This
third type of ball can also be formed by excess solder paste on the pad, and by misdeposition on nonwettable
areas of the substrate.
The reader is referred to Lau and Pau (1996) for discussions of ﬁnite element modeling of solder joints, and
detailed analytical studies of most aspects of basic joints and of joint failures. Various articles by Engelmaier et
al. also address many solder joint reliability issues and their analytical analysis. These and other sources discuss
in detail the quality issues that affect solder paste:
. Viscosity and its measurement
. Printability
. Open time
. Slump
. Metal content
. Particle/ball size in mesh
. Particle/ball size consistency
. Wetting
. Storage conditions
Note with regard to viscosity measurements, some paste manufacturers will prefer the spindle technique
and some the spiral technique. To properly compare the paste manufacturer’s readings with your tests, the
same technique must be used.

5.9
Parts Inspection and Placement
Brieﬂy, all parts must be inspected prior to use. Functional parts testing should be performed on the same
basis as for through-hole devices. Each manufacturer of electronic assemblies is familiar with the various
processes used on through-hole parts, and similar processes must be in place on SMDs. Problems with
solderability of leads and lead planarity are two items that can lead to the largest number of defects in the
ﬁnished product. Solderability is even more important with SMDs than with through-hole parts because all
electrical and mechanical strength rests within the solder joint, there being no hole-with-lead to add
mechanical strength.
Lead coplanarity is deﬁned as follows. If a multilead part, e.g., IC, is placed on a planar surface, lack of ideal
coplanarity exists if the lowest solderable part of any lead does not touch that surface. Coplanarity
requirements vary depending on the pitch of the component leads and their shape, but generally out-of-plane
measurements should not exceed 4 mils (0.004 in.) for 50 mil pitch devices, and 2 mils for 25 mil pitch
devices. All SMDs undergo thermal shocking during the soldering process, particularly if the SMDs are to be
wave-soldered (Type II or Type III boards), which means they will be immersed in the molten solder wave for
2 to 4 sec. Therefore, all plastic-packaged parts must be controlled for moisture content. If the parts have not
been stored in a low-humidity environment (,25% RH), then the absorbed moisture will expand during the
solder process and crack the package—a phenomenon know as ‘‘popcorning’’ because the crack is
accompanied by a loud ‘‘pop’’ and the package expands due to the expansion of moisture, just like real
popcorn. IC suppliers have strict recommendations on storage ambient humidity and temperature, and also
on the baking procedures necessary to allow safe reﬂow soldering if those recommendations are not heeded.
Follow them carefully. Typically, if storage RH is above 20%, baking must be considered prior to reﬂow.
Parts Placement
Proper parts placement not only places the parts within an acceptable window relative to the solder pad
pattern on the substrate, but the placement machine will apply enough downward pressure on the part to
force it halfway into the solder paste as well (Figure 5.10a and b). This assures both that the part will sit still
when the board is moved, and that coplanarity offsets within limits will still result in an acceptable solder joint.
The effects of coplanarity can be calculated mathematically by considering:
. the thickness of the solder paste deposit, T
. maximum coplanarity offsets among leads, C
. lead penetration in paste, P
Parts placement may be done manually for prototype or low-volume operations, although this author
suggests the use of guided X–Y tables with vacuum part pickup for even the smallest operation. Manual

placement of SMDs does not lend itself to repeatable work. For medium and high volume work, a multitude of
machines are available (see Figure 5.11). Major manufacturers of medium and high volume SMT placement
equipment include Assembleon (nee´ Philips) Fuji, Juki, Panasonic, Siplace, and Universal.
One good source for manufacturer’s information on placement machines and most other equipment
used in the various SMT production and testing phases is the annual Directory of Suppliers to the
Electronics Manufacturing Industry, published by Electronic Packaging and Production. Among the
elements to consider in the selection of placement equipment, whether fully automated or X–Y-vacuum
assist tables, are:
. Volume of parts to be placed per hour
. Conveyorized links to existing equipment
. Packaging of components to be handled: tubes, reels, trays, bulk, etc.
. Ability to download placement information from CAD/CAM systems
. Ability to modify placement patterns by the operator
. Vision capability needed, for board ﬁducials and/or ﬁne-pitch parts

Checks of new placement equipment, or in-place equipment when problems occur, should include:
. X-, Y-, and Z-axis accuracy
. Placement pressure
. Vision system checks both downward and upward
It must be emphasized that placement accuracy checks cannot be made using standard circuit boards.
Special glass plates with engraved measurement patterns and corresponding glass parts must be used because
standard circuit boards and parts vary too widely to allow accurate X-, Y-, and Q-measurement.
5.10
Reﬂow Soldering
Once SMDs have been placed in solder paste, the assembly will be reﬂow soldered. This can be done
in either batch-type ovens or conveyorized continuous-process ovens. The choice depends primarily on
the board throughput per hour required. While many early ovens were of the vapor phase type, most
ovens today use infrared (IR) heating, convection heating, or a combination of the two. In IR ovens,
the absorbance of the paste, parts, glue, etc., as a function of color should be considered. Convection
ovens tend to be more forgiving with variations in color and thermal masses on the substrates. This
author does not recommend vapor-phase (condensation heating) ovens to new users of SMT. All ovens
are zoned to provide a thermal proﬁle necessary for successful SMD soldering. An example of an
oven proﬁle is shown in Figure 5.12, and the phases of reﬂow soldering reﬂected in that example
include:
. Preheating:
The substrate, components, and solder paste are preheated.
. Drying:
Solvents evaporate from the solder paste. Flux activates, reduces oxides, and evaporates. Both
low- and high-mass components have enough soak time to reach temperature equilibrium.
. Reﬂow:
The solder paste temperature exceeds the liquidus point and reﬂows, wetting both the
component leads and the board pads. Surface tension effects occur, minimizing wetted volume.
. Cooling:
The solder paste cools below the liquidus point, forming acceptable (shiny and appropriate
volume) solder joints.

Technology Handbook, Minneapolis, Minn.: Research, Inc., 1992. With permission.)
5-17
Surface Mount Technology

The setting of the reﬂow proﬁle for an oven such as that shown in Figure 5.13 is not trivial. It will vary
depending on whether the ﬂux is RMA, water soluble, or no-clean, and it will also vary depending on both the
mix of low- and high-thermal mass components, and on how those components are laid out on the board.
The proﬁle should exceed the liquidus temperature of the solder paste by 20 to 25–C. While ﬁnal setting of the
proﬁle will depend on the actual quality of the solder joints formed in the oven, initial proﬁle setting should
rely heavily on information from the solder paste vendor, as well as the oven manufacturer. Remember that the
proﬁle shown is the proﬁle to be developed on the substrate, and the actual control settings in various stages of
the oven itself may be considerably different, depending on the thermal inertia of the product in the oven and
the heating characteristics of the particular oven being used. This should be determined not by the oven
settings but by instrumenting actual circuit boards with thermocouples and determining that the proﬁles at
various locations on the circuit board meet the speciﬁcations necessary for good soldering.
Defects as a result of a poor thermal proﬁle in the oven may include:
. Component thermal shock
. Solder splatter
. Solder balls formation
. Dewetted solder
. Cold or dull solder joints
It should be noted that many other problems
might contribute to defective solder joint formation.
One example would be placement misalignment
which contributes to the formation of solder bridges,
as shown in Figure 5.14.
Other problems that may contribute to defective
solder joints include poor solder mask adhesion, and
unequal solder land areas at opposite ends of passive
parts, which creates unequal moments as the paste
liquiﬁes and develops surface tension. Wrong solder
paste volumes, whether too much or too little, will
create defects, as will board shake in placement
machines and coplanarity problems in IC compo-
nents. Many of these problems should be covered and
compensated for during the design process and the

Postreﬂow Inspection
Final analysis of the process is performed based on the quality of the solder joints formed in the reﬂow process.
Whatever criteria may have been followed during the overall process, solder joint quality is the ﬁnal
determining factor of the correctness of the various process steps. As noted earlier, the quality level of solder
joint production is a major factor in successful board assembly. A primary criterion is the indication of wetting
at the junction of the reﬂowed solder and the part termination. This same criterion shown in Figure 5.15
applies to both through-hole and SMDs, with only the inspection location being different.
Note that criteria shown in Figure 5.15 are for any solderable surface, whether component or board, SMTor
THT. Some lead surfaces are deﬁned as not solderable, e.g., the cut and not-tinned end of an SO or QFP lead is
not considered solderable. Parts manufacturers will deﬁne whether a given surface is designed to be solderable.
Presentation of criteria for all the various SMD package types and all the possible solder joint problems
is beyond the scope of this chapter. The reader is directed to Hollomon (1995) and Prasad (1997) for an
in-depth discussion of these issues.
5.11
Cleaning
Cleaning, like all other parts of the process, should be considered during the design phase. Cleaning
requirements are determined largely by the ﬂux in the solder paste, and should be determined before
production is ever started. Design issues may affect the choice of ﬂux, which determines cleaning. For example,
low-clearance (close to the substrate) parts are difﬁcult to clean under, and the use of no-clean ﬂux may be
suggested.
RMA is the old standard, and if cleaning is needed with RMA, either solvent-based cleaners or water with
saponiﬁers must be used. (Saponiﬁers are alkaline materials that react with the rosin so that it becomes
water soluble.) RMA tends to be nonactive at room temperatures, and may not need to be cleaned on
commercial products designed for indoor use. The major limitation on RMA at this point is the need for
chemicals in the cleaning process.
Water-soluble ﬂuxes are designed to be cleaned with pure water. They remain active at room temperatures,
and therefore must be cleaned when used. Beyond their activity, the other disadvantage to water-soluble ﬂuxes
is that their higher surface tension relative to solvent-based cleaners means there is more difﬁculty cleaning
under low-clearance components.
No-clean ﬂuxes are designed not to be cleaned, and this means they are of low activity (they do not reduce
oxides as well as other types of ﬂux) and when used they should not be cleaned. No-clean ﬂuxes are designed
so that after reﬂow they microscopically encapsulate themselves, sealing in any active components. If the
substrate is subsequently cleaned, the encapsulants may be destroyed, leaving the possibility of active ﬂux
components remaining on the board.
The lead-free process may bring with it new ﬂux compounds. These may require additional considerations
in design, assembly, and cleaning processes.

Prototype Systems
Systems for all aspects of SMT assembly are available to support low-volume/prototype needs. These systems
will typically have manual solder-paste deposition and parts placement systems, with these functions being
assisted for the user. Syringe solder paste deposition may be as simple as a manual medical-type syringe
dispenser that must be guided and squeezed freehand. More sophisticated systems will have the syringe
mounted on an X–Yarm to carry the weight of the syringe, and will apply air pressure to the top of the syringe
with a foot-pedal control, freeing the operator’s arm to guide the syringe to the proper location on the
substrate and perform the negative Z-axis maneuver that will bring the syringe tip into the proper location and
height above the substrate. Dispensing is then accomplished by a timed air pressure burst applied to the top of
the syringe under foot-pedal control. Paste volume is likewise determined by trial-and-error with the time/
pressure relation and depends on the type and manufacturer of paste being dispensed.
Parts placement likewise may be as simple as tweezers and may progress to hand-held vacuum probes to
allow easier handling of the components. As mentioned in Section ‘‘Parts Inspection and Placement’’, X–Y
arm/tables are available, which have vacuum-pick nozzles to allow the operator to pick a part from a tray, reel,
or stick, and move the part over the correct location on the substrate. The part is then moved down into the
solder paste, the vacuum is turned off manually or automatically, and the nozzle is raised away from the
substrate.
Soldering of prototype/low-volume boards may be carried out by contact soldering of each component, by a
manually guided hot-air tool, or in a small batch or conveyorized oven. Each step up in soldering
sophistication is, of course, accompanied by an increase in the investment required.
For manufacturers with large prototype requirements, it is possible to set up an entire line that would
involve virtually no hardware changes from one board to another:
. ECAD design and analysis, producing Gerber ﬁles.
. CNC circuit board mill takes Gerber ﬁles and mills out two-sided boards.
. Software translation package generates solder-pad centroid information.
. Syringe solder paste deposition system takes a translated Gerber ﬁle and dispenses an appropriate
amount at each pad centroid.
. Software translation package generates part centroid information.
. Parts placement equipment places parts based on translated part centroid information.
. Assembly is reﬂow soldered.
The only manual process in the above system is adjustment of the reﬂow proﬁle based on the results
of soldering an assembly. The ﬁnal step in the process would be to test the ﬁnished prototype board. This
system could also be used for very small-volume production runs, and all components as described are
available. With a change from milled boards to etched boards, the system can be used as a ﬂexible assembly
system.
Deﬁning Terms
Coefﬁcient of thermal expansion (CTE, aka TCE):
A measure of the ratio between the measure of a
material and its expansion as temperature increases. May be different in X-, Y-, and Z-axes. Expressed in
ppm/–C. A measure that allows comparison of materials that are to be joined.
Coplanarity:
A simpliﬁed deﬁnition of planarity, which is difﬁcult to measure. Coplanarity is the distance

above the plate is the measurement of coplanarity.

Below Tg, a polymer substance, such as ﬁberglass, is relatively linear
in its expansion/contraction due to temperature changes. Above Tg, the expansion rate increases
dramatically and becomes nonlinear. The polymer will also lose its stability, i.e., an FR-4 board ‘‘droops’’
above Tg.

SPICE Computer Models ....................................................... 6-6
The concept of the operational ampliﬁer (usually referred to as an op amp) originated at the beginning
of the Second World War with the use of vacuum tubes in dc ampliﬁer designs developed by the
George A. Philbrick Co. (some of the early history of operational ampliﬁers is found in Williams, 1991).
The op amp was the basic building block for early electronic servomechanisms, for synthesizers, and in
particular for analog computers used to solve differential equations. With the advent of the ﬁrst
monolithic integrated-circuit (IC) op amp in 1965 (the mA709, designed by the late Bob Widlar, then with
Fairchild Semiconductor), the availability of op amps was no longer a factor, while within a few years the
cost of these devices (which had been as high as $200 each) rapidly plummeted to close to that of
individual discrete transistors.
Although the digital computer has now largely supplanted the analog computer in mathematically intensive
applications, the use of inexpensive op amps in instrumentation applications, in pulse shaping, in ﬁltering,
and in signal processing applications in general has continued to grow. There are currently many commercial
manufacturers whose main products are high-quality op amps. This competitiveness has ensured a
marketplace featuring a wide range of relatively inexpensive devices suitable for use by electronic engineers,
physicists, chemists, biologists, and almost any discipline that requires obtaining quantitative analog data from
instrumented experiments.
Most op amp circuits can be analyzed, at least for ﬁrst-order calculations, by considering the op amp to
be an ‘‘ideal’’ device. For more quantitative information, however, and particularly when frequency response
and dc offsets are important, one must refer to a more ‘‘practical’’ model that includes the internal
limitations of the device. If the op amp is characterized by a really complete model, the resulting circuit
may be quite complex, leading to rather laborious calculations. Fortunately, however, computer
analysis using the program SPICE signiﬁcantly reduces the problem to one of a simple input speciﬁcation
to the computer. Today, nearly all the op amp manufacturers provide SPICE models for their line of
devices, with excellent correlation obtained between the computer simulation and the actual measured
results.
6.1
The Ideal Op Amp
An ideal operational ampliﬁer is a dc-coupled ampliﬁer having two inputs and normally one
output (although in a few infrequent cases there may be a differential output). The inputs are designated as
6-1

noninverting (designated þ or NI) and inverting (designated – or Inv.). The ampliﬁed signal is the differential
signal, ve, between the two inputs, so that the output voltage as indicated in Figure 6.1 is
vout ¼ AOLðvB  vAÞ
ð6:1Þ
The general characteristics of an ideal op amp can be summarized as follows:
1. The open-loop gain AOL is inﬁnite. Or, since the output signal vout is ﬁnite, then the differential input
signal ve must approach zero.
2. The input resistance RIN is inﬁnite, while the output resistance RO is zero.
3. The ampliﬁer has zero current at the input (iA and iB in Figure 6.1 are zero), but the op amp can either
sink or source an inﬁnite current at the output.
4. The op amp is not sensitive to a common signal on both inputs (i.e., vA ¼ vB); thus, the output voltage
change due to a common input signal will be zero. This common signal is referred to as a common-mode
signal, and manufacturers specify this effect by an op amp’s common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which
relates the ratio of the open-loop gain (AOL) of the op amp to the common-mode gain (ACM). Hence, for
an ideal op amp CMRR ¼ 1.
5. A somewhat analogous speciﬁcation to the CMRR is the power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR), which
relates the ratio of a power supply voltage change to an equivalent input voltage change produced by the
change in the power supply. Because an ideal op amp can operate with any power supply, without
restriction, then for the ideal device PSRR ¼ 1.
6. The gain of the op amp is not a function of frequency. This implies an inﬁnite bandwidth.
Although the foregoing requirements for an ideal op amp appear to be impossible to achieve practically,
modern devices can quite closely approximate many of these conditions. An op amp with a ﬁeld-effect
transistor (FET) on the input would certainly not have zero input current and inﬁnite input resistance, but
a current of ,10 pA and an RIN ¼ 1012 O is obtainable and is a reasonable approximation to the ideal
conditions. Further, although a CMRR and PSRR of inﬁnity are not possible, there are several commercial
op amps available with values of 140 dB (i.e., a ratio of 107). Open-loop gains of several precision op amps
now have reached values of .107, although certainly not inﬁnity. The two most difﬁcult ideal conditions to
approach are the ability to handle large output currents and the requirement of a gain independence with
frequency.
Using the ideal model conditions it is quite simple to evaluate the two basic op amp circuit conﬁgurations,
(1) the inverting ampliﬁer and (2) the noninverting ampliﬁer, as designated in Figure 6.2.
For the ideal inverting ampliﬁer, since the open-loop gain is inﬁnite and since the output voltage vo is ﬁnite,
then the input differential voltage (often referred to as the error signal) ve must approach zero, or the input
current is
iI ¼ vI  ve
R1
¼ vI  0
R1

The feedback current iF must equal iI, and the output voltage must then be due to the voltage drop
across RF, or

The inverting connection thus has a voltage gain vo/vI of  RF/R1, an input resistance seen by vI of R1 ohms
(from Equation (6.2)), and an output resistance of 0 O. By a similar analysis for the noninverting circuit of
Figure 6.2(b), since ve is zero, then signal vI must appear across resistor R1, producing a current of vI/R1, which
must ﬂow through resistor R F. Hence the output voltage is the sum of the voltage drops across RF and R1, or
v0 ¼ RF

Ideal and Practical Models

As opposed to the inverting connection, the input resistance seen by the source vI is now equal to an inﬁnite
resistance, since RIN for the ideal op amp is inﬁnite.
6.2
Practical Op Amps
A nonideal op amp is characterized not only by ﬁnite open-loop gain, input and output resistance, ﬁnite
currents, and frequency bandwidths, but also by various nonidealities due to the construction of the op amp
circuit or external connections. A complete model for a practical op amp is illustrated in Figure 6.3. The
nonideal effects of the PSRR and CMRR are represented by the input series voltage sources of DVsupply/PSRR
and VCM/CMRR, where DVsupply would be any total change of the two power supply voltages, Vþ
dc and V
dc,
from their nominal values, while VCM is the voltage common to both inputs of the op amp. The open-loop
gain of the op amp is no longer inﬁnite but is modeled by a network of the output impedance Zout (which may
be merely a resistor but could also be a series R–L network) in series with a source A(s), which includes all the
open-loop poles and zeroes of the op amp as
FIGURE 6.3

where AOL is the ﬁnite dc open-loop gain, while poles are at frequencies op1, op2,. . . and zeroes are at oZ1, etc.
The differential input resistance is ZIN, which is typically a resistance RIN in parallel with a capacitor CIN.
Similarly, the common-mode input impedance ZCM is established by placing an impedance 2ZCM in parallel with
each input terminal. Normally, ZCM is best represented by a parallel resistance and capacitance of 2RCM (which is
44 RIN) and CCM/2. The dc bias currents at the input are represented by Iþ
B and I
B current sources that would
equal the input base currents if a differential bipolar transistor were used as the input stage of the op amp, or the
input gate currents if FETs were used. The fact that the two transistors of the input stage of the op amp may not be
perfectly balanced is represented by an equivalent input offset voltage source, VOS, in series with the input.
The smallest signal that can be ampliﬁed is always limited by the inherent random noise internal to the op
amp itself. In Figure 6.3 the noise effects are represented by an equivalent input voltage source (ENV), which
when multiplied by the gain of the op amp would equal the total output noise present if the inputs to the op
amp were shorted. In a similar fashion, if the inputs to the op amp were open circuited, the total output noise
would equal the sum of the noise due to the equivalent input current sources (ENI1 and ENI–), each multiplied
by their respective current gain to the output. Because noise is a random variable, this summation must be
accomplished in a squared fashion, i.e.:
E2

v þ ðENIþÞ2AI1 þ ðENIÞ2A2

ð6:6Þ
Typically, the correlation (C) between the ENVand ENI sources is low, so the assumption of C < 0 can be made.
For the basic circuits of Figure 6.2(a) or (b), if the signal source vI is shorted then the output voltage due to
the nonideal effects would be (using the model of Figure 6.3):

where it is assumed that a resistor R2 is also in series with the noninverting input of either Figure 6.2(a)
or (b). The thermal noise (often called Johnson or Nyquist noise) due to the resistors R1, R2, and RF is
given by (in rms volt2/Hz):

where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is absolute temperature (Kelvin). To obtain the total output noise, one
must multiply the E2
out expression of Equation (6.10) by the noise bandwidth of the circuit, which typically is
equal to p/2 times the –3 dB signal bandwidth, for a single-pole response system (Kennedy, 1988).
6.3
SPICE Computer Models
The use of op amps can be considerably simpliﬁed by computer-aided analysis using the program SPICE.
SPICE originated with the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975 (Nagel, 1975), although more
recent user-friendly commercial versions are now available such as HSPICE, HPSPICE, IS-SPICE, PSPICE,
and ZSPICE, to mention a few of those most widely used. A simple macromodel for a near-ideal
op amp could be simply stated with the SPICE subcircuit ﬁle (* indicates a comment that is not processed
by the ﬁle):
:SUBCKT IDEALOA 1 2 3
*A near-ideal op amp: ð1Þ is noninv; ð2Þ is inv; and ð3Þ is output:

ð6:12Þ
The circuit model for IDEALOA would appear as in Figure 6.4(a). A more complete model, but not
including nonideal offset effects, could be constructed for the 741 op amp as the subcircuit ﬁle OA741, shown
in Figure 6.4(b).

The most widely used op amp macromodel that includes dc offset effects is the Boyle model (Boyle et al.,
1974). Most op amp manufacturers use this model, usually with additions to add more poles (and perhaps
zeroes). The various resistor and capacitor values, as well as transistor, and current and voltage generator,
values are intimately related to the speciﬁcations of the op amp, as shown earlier in the nonideal model of
6-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Figure 6.3. The appropriate equations are too involved to list here; instead, the interested reader is referred to
the article by Boyle in the listed references. The Boyle model does not accurately model noise effects, nor does
it fully model PSRR and CMRR effects.
A more circuits-oriented approach to modeling op amps can be obtained if the input transistors are
removed and a model formed by using passive components along with both ﬁxed and dependent voltage and
current sources. Such a model is shown in Figure 6.5. This model not only includes all the basic nonideal
effects of the op amp, allowing for multiple poles and zeroes, but can also accurately include ENV and ENI
noise effects. The circuits-approach macromodel can also be easily adapted to current-feedback op amp
designs, whose input impedance at the noninverting input is much greater than that at the inverting input

Large Signal Analysis
Gordon L. Carpenter
Large signal ampliﬁers are usually conﬁned to using bipolar transistors as their solid-state devices because of
the large linear region of ampliﬁcation required. One exception to this is the use of VMOS for large power
outputs due to their ability to have a large linear region. There are three basic conﬁgurations of ampliﬁers:
common emitter (CE) ampliﬁers, common base (CB) ampliﬁers, and common collection (CC) ampliﬁers. The
basic conﬁguration of each is shown in Figure 7.1.
In an ampliﬁer system, the last stage of a voltage ampliﬁer string has to be considered as a large signal
ampliﬁer, and generally EF ampliﬁers are used as large signal ampliﬁers. This then requires that the dc bias or
dc operating point (quiescent point) be located near the center of the load line in order to get the maximum
output voltage swing. Small signal analysis can be used to evaluate the ampliﬁer for voltage gain, current gain,
input impedance, and output impedance, all of which are discussed later.
DC Operating Point
Each transistor connected in a particular ampliﬁer conﬁguration has a set of characteristic curves, as shown in
Figure 7.2.
When ampliﬁers are coupled together with capacitors, the conﬁguration is as shown in Figure 7.3. The
load resistor is really the input impedance of the next stage. To be able to evaluate this ampliﬁer, a dc
equivalent circuit needs to be developed as shown in Figure 7.4. This will result in the following dc bias
equation:
ICQ ¼
VBB  VBE
RB=beta þ RE
Assume hFE 44 1
where beta (hFE) is the current gain of the transistor and VBE is the conducting voltage across the base-emitter
junction. This equation is the same for all ampliﬁer conﬁgurations. Looking at Figure 7.3, the input circuit can
be reduced to the dc circuit shown in Figure 7.4 using circuit analysis techniques, resulting in the following

VBB ¼ VTH ¼ VCCðR1Þ=ðR1 þ R2Þ
RB ¼ RTH ¼ R1==R2
For this biasing system, the The´venin equivalent resistance and the The´venin equivalent voltage can be
determined. For design with the biasing system shown in Figure 7.3, then
R1 ¼ RB=ð1  VBB=VCCÞ
R2 ¼ RBðVCC=VBBÞ
Graphical Approach
To understand the graphical approach, a clear understanding of the dc and ac load lines is necessary. The dc
load line is based on the Kirchhoff’s equation from the dc power source to ground (all capacitors open):
VCC ¼ vCE þ iCRDC
where RDC is the sum of the resistors in the collector-emitter loop.
The ac load line is the loop, assuming the transistor is the ac source and the source voltage is zero, then
V0
CC ¼ vce þ iCRac
where Rac is the sum of series resistors in that loop with all the capacitors shorted. The load lines then can be
constructed on the characteristic curves as shown in Figure 7.5. From this it can be seen that to get
the maximum output voltage swing, the quiescent point, or Q point, should be located in the middle of the
FIGURE 7.5
Load lines. (Source: C.J. Savant, M. Roden, and G. Carpenter, Electronic Design, Circuits and Systems, 2nd ed.,

Ampliﬁers

ac load line. To place the Q point in the middle of the ac load line, ICQ can be determined from the equation:
ICQ ¼ VCC=ðRDC þ RacÞ
To minimize distortion caused by the cutoff and saturation regions, the top 5% and the bottom 5% are
discarded. This then results in the equation (Figure 7.6):
Vo ðpeak to peakÞ ¼ 2 ð0:9Þ ICQ ðRC==RLÞ
If, however, the Q point is not in the middle of the ac load line, the output voltage swing will be reduced.
Below the middle of the ac load line (Figure 7.7(a)):
Vo ðpeak to peakÞ ¼ 2 ðICQ  0:05ICMaxÞ RC==RL
Above the middle of the ac load line (Figure 7.7(b)):
Vo ðpeak to peakÞ ¼ 2 ð0:95ICMax  ICQÞ RC==RL
These values allow the highest allowable input signal to be used to avoid any distortion by dividing the voltage
gain of the ampliﬁer into the maximum output voltage swing. The preceding equations are the same for the
CB conﬁguration. For the EF conﬁgurations, the RC is changed to RE in the equations.

Power Ampliﬁers
Emitter followers can be used as power ampliﬁers. Even though they have less than unity voltage gain they can
provide high current gain. Using the standard linear EF ampliﬁer for a maximum output voltage swing provides
less than 25% efﬁciency (ratio of power in to power out). The dc current carrying the ac signal is where the loss of
efﬁciency occurs. To avoid this power loss, the Q point is placed at ICQ equal to zero, thus using the majority of
the power for the output signal. This allows the efﬁciency to increase to as much as 70%. Full signal
ampliﬁcation requires one transistor to amplify the positive portion of the input signal and another
transistor to amplify the negative portion of the input signal. In the past, this was referred to as
push-pull operation. A better system is to use an NPN transistor for the positive part of the input signal
and a PNP transistor for the negative part. This type of operation is referred to as Class B complementary
symmetry operation (Figure 7.8).
In Figure 7.8, the dc voltage drop across R1 provides the voltage to bias the transistor at cutoff. Because these
are power transistors, the temperature will change based on the amount of power the transistor is absorbing.
This means the base-emitter junction voltage will have to change to keep ICQ ¼ 0. To compensate for this
change in temperature, the R1 resistors are replaced with diodes or transistors connected as diodes with the
same turn-on characteristics as the power transistors. This type of conﬁguration is referred to as the
complementary symmetry diode compensated (CSDC) ampliﬁer and is shown in Figure 7.9. To avoid
crossover distortion, small resistors can be placed in series with the diodes so that ICQ can be raised slightly
above zero to get increased ampliﬁcation in the cutoff region. Another problem that needs to be addressed is
the possibility of thermal runaway. This can be easily solved by placing small resistors in series with the
emitters of the power transistors. For example, if the load is an 8-O speaker, the resistors should not be greater
than 0.47 O to avoid output signal loss.
To design this type of ampliﬁer, the dc current in the bias circuit must be large enough so that the diodes
remain on during the entire input signal. This requires the dc diode current to be equal to or larger than the
zero to peak current of the input signal, or

When designing to a speciﬁc power, both IB and VL can be determined. This allows the selection of the value of
R2 and the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 7.10 can be developed. Using this equivalent circuit, both the

Small Signal Analysis
John Choma, Jr.
This section introduces the reader to the analytical methodologies that underlie the design of small signal, analog
bipolar junction transistor (BJT) ampliﬁers. Analog circuit and system design entails complementing basic
circuit analysis skills with the art of architecting a circuit topology that produces acceptable input-to-output
(I/O) electrical characteristics. Because design is not the inverse of analysis, analytically proﬁcient engineers are
not necessarily adept at design. However, circuit and system analyses that conduce an insightful understanding of
meaningful topological structures arguably foster design creativity. Accordingly, this section focuses more on the
problems of interpreting analytical results in terms of their circuit performance implications than it does on
enhancing basic circuit analysis skills. Insightful interpretation breeds engineering understanding. In turn, such
an understanding of the electrical properties of circuits promotes topological reﬁnements and innovations that
produce reliable and manufacturable, high performance electronic circuits and systems.
Hybrid-Pi Equivalent Circuit
In order for a BJT to function properly in linear ampliﬁer applications, it must operate in the forward active
region of its volt–ampere characteristic curves. Two conditions ensure BJT operation in the forward domain.
First, the applied emitter-base terminal voltage must forward bias the intrinsic emitter-base junction diode at
all times. Second, the instantaneous voltage established across the base-collector terminals of the transistor
must preclude a forward biased intrinsic base-collector diode. The simultaneous satisfaction of these two
conditions requires appropriate biasing subcircuits, and it imposes restrictions on the amplitudes of applied
input signals (Clarke and Hess, 1978).
The most commonly used BJT equivalent circuit for investigating the dynamical responses to small input
signals is the hybrid-pi model offered in Figure 7.11 (Sedra and Smith, 1987). In this model, Rb, Rc, and Re,
respectively, represent the internal base, collector, and emitter resistances of the considered BJT. Although these

series resistances vary somewhat with quiescent operating point (de Graaf, 1969), they can be viewed as
constants in ﬁrst-order manual analyses.
The emitter-base junction diffusion resistance, Rp, is the small signal resistance of the emitter-base junction diode.
It represents the inverse of the slope of the common emitter static input characteristic curves. Analytically, Rp is
given by
Rp ¼ hFENFVT
ICQ
ð7:1Þ
where hFE is the static common emitter current gain of the BJT, NF is the emitter-base junction injection
coefﬁcient, VT is the Boltzmann voltage corresponding to an absolute junction operating temperature of T, and ICQ
is the quiescent collector current.
The expression for the resistance, Ro, which accounts for conductivity modulation in the neutral base, is
Ro ¼ V0

where VAF is the forward early voltage, V0
CEQ is the quiescent voltage developed across the internal collector–
emitter terminals, and IKF symbolizes the forward knee current. The knee current is a measure of the onset
of high injection effects (Gummel and Poon, 1970) in the base. In particular, a collector current numeri-
cally equal to IKF implies that the forward biasing of the emitter-base junction promotes a net minority
carrier charge injected into the base from the emitter that is equal to the background majority charge in the
neutral base. The Early voltage is an inverse measure of the slope of the common emitter output
characteristic curves.
The ﬁnal low frequency parameter of the hybrid-pi model is the forward transconductance, gm.
This parameter, which is a measure of the forward small signal gain available at a quiescent operating point,
is given by

Two capacitances, Cp and Cm, are incorporated in the small signal model to provide a ﬁrst-order approxi-

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side represents the depletion component and the second term is the

the ﬁeld-neutral base, CJE is the zero bias value of emitter-base junction depletion capacitance, VJE is the
built-in potential of the junction, VE is the forward biasing voltage developed across the intrinsic emitter-base
junction, and MJE is the grading coefﬁcient of the junction. The capacitance, Cm, has only a depletion
component, owing to the reverse (or at most zero) bias impressed across the internal base-collector
junction. Accordingly, its analytical form is analogous to the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of

The signiﬁcance of Equation (7.6) is best appreciated by studying the simple circuit diagram of Figure 7.12(a),
which depicts the grounded emitter conﬁguration of a BJT biased for linear operation at a quiescent base
current of IBQ and a quiescent collector-emitter voltage of VCEQ. Note that the battery supplying VCEQ grounds
the collector for small signal conditions. The small signal model of the circuit at hand is resultantly seen to be
the topology offered in Figure 7.12(b), where iBS and iCS, respectively, denote the signal components of the net
instantaneous base current, iB, and the net instantaneous collector current, iC.
For negligibly small internal collector (Rc) and emitter (Re) resistances, it can be shown that the small signal,

Hybrid-Pi Equivalent Circuit of a Monolithic BJT
The conventional hyprid-pi model in Figure 7.11 generally fails to provide sufﬁciently accurate predictions of
the high frequency response of monolithic diffused or implanted BJTs. One reason for this modeling
inaccuracy is that the hybrid-pi equivalent circuit does not reﬂect the fact that monolithic transistors are
often fabricated on lightly doped, noninsulating substrates that establish a distributed, large area, pn-
junction with the collector region. Since the substrate-collector pn-junction is back biased in linear
applications of a BJT, negligible static and low frequency signal currents ﬂow from the collector to the
substrate. At high frequencies, however, the depletion capacitance associated with the reverse-biased
substrate-collector junction can cause signiﬁcant susceptive loading of the collector port. In Figure 7.13, the
lumped capacitance, Cbb, whose mathematical deﬁnition is similar to that of Cm in Equation (7.5), provides
a ﬁrst-order account of this collector loading. Observe that this substrate capacitance appears in series with a
substrate resistance, Rbb, which reﬂects the light doping nature of the substrate material. For monolithic
transistors fabricated on insulating or semi-insulating substrates, Rbb is a very large resistance, thereby
rendering Cbb unimportant with respect to the problem of predicting steady-state transistor responses at
high signal frequencies.
A problem that is even more signiﬁcant than parasitic substrate dynamics stems from the fact that
the hybrid-pi equivalent circuit in Figure 7.11 is premised on a uniform transistor structure whose
emitter-base and base-collector junction areas are identical. In a monolithic device, however, the effective
base-collector junction area is much larger than that of the emitter-base junction because the base region
is diffused or implanted into the collector (Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977). The effect of such a geometry
is twofold. First, the actual value of Cm is larger than the value predicated on the physical considerations
that surround a simpliﬁed uniform structure BJT. Second, Cm is not a single lumped capacitance that is
incident with only the intrinsic base-collector junction. Rather, the effective value of Cm is distributed
between the intrinsic collector and the entire base-collector junction interface. A ﬁrst-order account of this
capacitance distribution entails partitioning Cm in Figure 7.11 into two capacitances, say Cm1 and Cm2, as
indicated in Figure 7.13. In general, Cm2 is 3 to 5 times larger than Cm1. Whereas Cm1 is proportional to
the emitter-base junction area, Cm2 is proportional to the net base-collector junction area, less the area of
the emitter-base junction.
Just as Cm1 and Cm2 superimpose to yield the original Cm in the simpliﬁed high frequency model of a BJT,
the effective base resistances, Rb1 and Rb2, sum to yield the original base resistance, Rb. The resistance, Rb1, is
the contact resistance associated with the base lead and the inactive BJT base region. It is inversely proportional
to the surface area of the base contact. However, Rb2, which is referred to as the active base resistance, is
nominally an inverse function of emitter ﬁnger length. Because of submicron base widths and the relatively
light average doping concentrations of active base regions, Rb2 is signiﬁcantly larger than Rb1.

Common Emitter Ampliﬁer
The most commonly used canonic cell of linear BJT ampliﬁers is the common emitter ampliﬁer, whose basic
circuit schematic diagram is depicted in Figure 7.14(a). In this diagram, RST is the The´venin resistance of the
applied signal source, VST, and RLT is the effective, or The´venin, load resistance driven by the ampliﬁer. The
signal source has zero average, or dc, value. Although requisite biasing is not shown in the ﬁgure, it is tacitly
assumed that the transistor is biased for linear operation. Hence, the diagram at hand is actually the ac
schematic diagram; that is, it delineates only the signal paths of the circuit. Note that in the common emitter
orientation, the input signal is applied to the base of the transistor, while the resultant small signal voltage
response, VOS, is extracted at the transistor collector.
The hybrid-pi model of Figure 7.11 forms the basis for the small signal equivalent circuit of the common
emitter cell, which is given in Figure 7.14(b). In this conﬁguration, the capacitance, Co, represents an effective
output port capacitance that accounts for both substrate loading of the collector port (if the BJT is a
monolithic device) and the net effective shunt capacitance associated with the load.
At low signal frequencies, the capacitors, Cp, Cm, and Co in the model of Figure 7.14(b), can be replaced by
open circuits. A straightforward circuit analysis of the resultantly simpliﬁed equivalent circuit produces
analytical expressions for the low frequency values of the small signal voltage gain, AvCE ¼ VOS/VST; the driving
point input impedance, ZinCE; and the driving point output impedance, ZoutCE. Because the early resistance, Ro, is
invariably much larger than the resistance sum (Rc þ Re þ RLT), the low frequency voltage gain of the

At high signal frequencies, the capacitors in the small signal equivalent circuit of Figure 7.14(b) produce a
third-order voltage gain frequency response whose analytical formulation is algebraically cumbersome
(Singhal and Vlach, 1977; Haley, 1988). However, because the poles produced by these capacitors are real, lie
in the left half complex frequency plane, and generally have widely separated frequency values, the dominant
pole approximation provides an adequate estimate of high frequency common emitter ampliﬁer response in
the usable passband of the ampliﬁer. Accordingly, the high-frequency voltage gain, say AvCE(s), of the common
emitter ampliﬁer can be approximated as
AvCEðsÞ > AvCEð0Þ 1 þ sTzCE

ð7:15Þ
In this expression, TpCE is of the form:
TpCE ¼ RCpCp þ RCmCm þ RCoCo
ð7:16Þ
where RCp, RCm, and RCo, respectively, represent the The´venin resistances seen by the capacitors, Cp, Cm, and
Co, under the conditions that (1) all capacitors are supplanted by open circuits, and (2) the independent signal
generator, VST, is reduced to zero. Analogously, TzCE is of the form:
TzCE ¼ RCpoCp þ RCmoCm þ RCooCo
ð7:17Þ
where RCpo, RCmo, and RCoo, respectively, represent the The´venin resistances seen by the capacitors, Cp, Cm, and
Co, under the conditions that (1) all capacitors are supplanted by open circuits and (2) the output voltage
response, VOS, is constrained to zero while maintaining nonzero input signal source voltage. It can be shown
that when Ro is very large and Rc is negligibly small:

Ampliﬁers

Design Considerations for the Common Emitter Ampliﬁer
Equation (7.12) underscores a serious shortcoming of the canonical common emitter conﬁguration. In
particular, since the internal emitter resistance of a BJT is small, the low-frequency voltage gain is sensitive to
the processing uncertainties that accompany the numerical value of the small signal beta. The problem can be
rectiﬁed at the price of a diminished voltage gain magnitude by inserting an emitter degeneration resistance,
REE, in series with the emitter lead, as shown in Figure 7.15(a). Since REE appears in series with the internal
emitter resistance, Re, as suggested in Figure 7.15(b), the impact of emitter degeneration can be assessed
analytically by replacing Re in Equation (7.12) to Equation (7.28) by the resistance sum (Re þ REE).
For sufﬁciently large REE, such that:
Re þ REE > REE 44 RST þ Rb þ Rp
bac þ 1
ð7:29Þ
the low-frequency voltage gain becomes
AvCEð0Þ >  aacRLT
REE
ð7:30Þ
where aac, which symbolizes the small signal, short circuit, common base current gain, or simply the ac alpha, of
the transistor is given by
aac ¼
bac
bac þ 1
ð7:31Þ
Despite numerical uncertainties in bac, minimum values of bac are much larger than one, thereby rendering
the voltage gain in Equation (7.30) almost completely independent of small signal BJT parameters.
A second effect of emitter degeneration is an increase in both the low-frequency driving point input and
output resistances. This contention is conﬁrmed by Equation (7.13), which shows that if Ro remains much
larger than (Rc þ Re þ REE þ RLT), a resistance in the amount of (bacþ1)REE is added to the input resistance
established
when
the

ground.
Likewise, Equation (7.14) veriﬁes that emitter degeneration increases the low-frequency driving point output
resistance. In fact, a very large value of REE produces an output resistance that approaches a limiting value of
(bac þ 1)Ro. It follows that a common emitter ampliﬁer that exploits emitter degeneration behaves as a
voltage-to-current converter at low signal frequencies. In particular, its high input resistance does not incur an

appreciable load on signal voltage sources that are characterized by even moderately large The´venin
resistances, while its large output resistance comprises an almost ideal current source at its output port.
A third effect of emitter degeneration is a decrease in the effective pole time constant, TpCE, as well as an
increase in the effective zero time constant, TzCE, which can be conﬁrmed by reinvestigating Equation (7.18)
to Equation (7.21) for the case of Re replaced by the resistance sum (Re þ REE). The use of an emitter
degeneration resistance therefore promotes an increased 3-dB circuit bandwidth. Unfortunately, it also yields a
diminished circuit gain-bandwidth product; that is, a given emitter degeneration resistance causes a
degradation in the low frequency gain magnitude that is larger than the corresponding bandwidth increase
promoted by this resistance. This deterioration of circuit gain-bandwidth product is a property of all negative
feedback circuits (Choma, 1984).
For reasonable values of the emitter degeneration resistance, REE, the The´venin time constant, RCmCm, is
likely to be the dominant contribution to the effective ﬁrst-order time constant, TpCE, attributed to the poles
of a common emitter ampliﬁer. Hence, Cm is the likely device capacitance that dominantly imposes an upper
limit to the achievable 3-dB bandwidth of a common emitter cell. The reason for this substantial bandwidth
sensitivity to Cm is the so-called Miller multiplication factor, say M, which appears as the last bracketed term
on the right-hand side of Equation (7.19), namely:
M ¼ 1 þ
bacðRLT þ RcÞ
Rp þ ðbac þ 1ÞRe
ð7:32Þ
The Miller factor, M, which effectively multiplies Cm in the expression for RCmCm, increases sharply with the
load resistance, RLT, and hence with the gain magnitude of the common emitter ampliﬁer. Note that in the
limit of a large emitter degeneration resistance (which adds directly to Re), Equation (7.30) reduces
Equation (7.32) to the factor:
M > 1 þ jAvCEð0Þj
ð7:33Þ
Common Base Ampliﬁer
A second canonic cell of linear BJTampliﬁers is the common base ampliﬁer, whose ac circuit schematic diagram
appears in Figure 7.16(a). In this diagram, RST, VST, RLT, and VOS retain the signiﬁcance they respectively have
in the previously considered common emitter conﬁguration. Note that in the common base orientation, the
input signal is applied to the base, while the resultant small signal voltage response is extracted at the collector
of a transistor.
The relevant small signal model is shown in Figure 7.16(b). A straightforward application of Kirchhoff’s
circuit laws gives, for the case of large Ro, a low-frequency voltage gain, AvCB(0) ¼ VOS/VST, of
AvCBð0Þ >

where RinCB is the low frequency value of the common base driving point input impedance:

Ampliﬁers

The preceding three equations underscore several operating characteristics that distinguish the common base
ampliﬁer from its common emitter counterpart. For example, Equation (7.35) suggests a low-frequency input
resistance that is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of a common emitter unit. To underscore this contention,
consider the case of two identical transistors, one used in a common emitter ampliﬁer and the other used in a
common base conﬁguration, that are biased at identical quiescent operating points. Under this circumstance,
Equation (7.35) and Equation (7.13) combine to deliver:
RinCB > RinCE
bac þ 1
ð7:37Þ
which shows that the common base input resistance is a factor of (bac þ 1) times smaller than the input
resistance of the common emitter cell. The resistance reﬂection factor, (bac þ 1), in Equation (7.37)
represents the ratio of small signal emitter current to small signal base current. Accordingly, Equation (7.37)
is self-evident when it is noted that the input resistance of a common base stage is referred to an input
emitter current, whereas the input resistance of its common emitter counterpart is referred to an input base
current.
A second difference between the common emitter and common base ampliﬁers is that the voltage gain of
the latter displays no phase inversion between source and response voltages. Moreover, for the same load and
source terminations and for identical transistors biased identically, the voltage gain of the common base cell is
likely to be much smaller than that of the common emitter unit. This contention is veriﬁed by substituting
Equation (7.37) into Equation (7.34) and using Equation (7.31), Equation (7.13), and Equation (7.12) to write:
AvCBð0Þ >
jAvCEð0Þj

ð7:38Þ
At high signal frequencies, the voltage gain, driving point input impedance, and driving point output
impedance can be approximated by functions whose analytical forms mirror those of Equation (7.15),
Equation (7.23), and Equation (7.24). Let TpCB and TzCB designate the time constants of the effective
dominant pole and the effective dominant zero, respectively, of the common base cell. An analysis of the
structure of Figure 7.16(b) resultantly produces, with Ro and Rc ignored:

Design Considerations for the Common Base Ampliﬁer
An adaptation of Equation (7.25) to Equation (7.28) to the common base stage conﬁrms that the driving
point input impedance is capacitive at high signal frequencies. However, gmRb 41 renders a common base
driving point input impedance that is inductive at high frequencies. This impedance property can be gainfully
exploited to realize monolithic shunt peaked ampliﬁers in which the requisite circuit inductance is synthesized
as the driving point input impedance of a common base stage (or the driving point output impedance of a
common collector cell) (Grebene, 1984).
The common base stage is often used to broadband the common emitter ampliﬁer by forming the common
emitter–common base cascode, whose ac schematic diagram is given in Figure 7.17. The broadbanding afforded
by the cascode structure stems from the fact that the effective low frequency load resistance, say RLe, seen by
the common emitter transistor, QE, is the small driving point input resistance of the common base ampliﬁer,
QB. This effective load resistance, as witnessed by Cm of the common emitter transistor, is much smaller than
the actual load resistance that terminates the output port of the ampliﬁer, thereby decreasing the Miller
multiplication of the Cm in QE. If the time constant savings afforded by decreased Miller multiplication is
larger than the sum of the additional time constants presented to the circuit by the common base transistor, an
enhancement of common emitter bandwidth occurs. Note that such bandwidth enhancement is realized
without compromising the common emitter gain–bandwidth product, since the voltage gain of the common
emitter–common base unit is almost identical to that of the common emitter ampliﬁer alone.
Common Collector Ampliﬁer
The ﬁnal canonic cell of linear BJT ampliﬁers is the common collector ampliﬁer. The ac schematic diagram of
this stage, which is often referred to as an emitter follower, is given in Figure 7.18(a). In emitter followers, the
input signal is applied to the base, and the resultant small signal output voltage is extracted at the transistor
emitter.
The small signal equivalent circuit corresponding to the ampliﬁer in Figure 7.18(a) is shown in
Figure 7.18(b). A straightforward circuit analysis gives, for the case of large Ro, a low-frequency voltage gain,
AvCC(0) ¼ VOS/VST, of:
AvCCð0Þ >

7-17

where RoutCC is the low frequency value of the driving point output impedance:
RoutCC ¼ ZoutCCð0Þ > Re þ Rb þ Rp þ RST
bac þ 1
ð7:44Þ
The low-frequency driving point output resistance is
RinCC ¼ ZinCCð0Þ > Rb þ Rp þ ðbac þ 1ÞðRe þ RLTÞ
ð7:45Þ
The facts that the voltage gain is less than one and is without phase inversion, the output resistance is small,
and the input resistance is large make the emitter follower an excellent candidate for impedance buffering
applications.
As in the cases of the common emitter and the common base ampliﬁers, the high-frequency voltage
gain, driving point input resistance, and driving point output resistance can be approximated by functions
having analytical forms that are similar to those of Equation (7.15), Equation (7.23), and Equation (7.24).
Let TpCC and TzCC designate the time constants of the effective dominant pole and the effective dominant
zero, respectively, of the emitter follower. Since the output port capacitance, Co, appears across a short
circuit, TpCC is expressible as
TpCC ¼ RCpCp þ RCmCm

Although the emitter follower possesses excellent wideband response characteristics, it should be noted
in Equation (7.48) that the internal collector resistance, Rc, incurs some Miller multiplication of the base-
collector junction capacitance, Cm. For this reason, monolithic common collector ampliﬁers work best
in broadband impedance buffering applications when they exploit transistors that have collector sinker
diffusions and buried collector layers, which collectively serve to minimize the parasitic internal collector
resistance.

Introduction
Passive ﬁlters are frequency-selective circuits constructed using only passive components such as resistors,
capacitors, and inductors. Other passive components such as distributed RC components, quartz crystals, and
surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are also used in special-purpose ﬁlters. However, active ﬁlters involve
active components such as operational ampliﬁers (op amps) or discrete transistors. Compared to their passive
counterparts, active ﬁlters are better suited to circuit board implementation because they avoid the need for
inductors. Switched capacitor ﬁlters are best suited to monolithic integration because they avoid the need for
large-valued passive components (resistors and capacitors).
This section describes basic ﬁlter theory, outlines the design of low-pass active ﬁlters, and introduces
switched capacitor ﬁlter design. Other types of ﬁlters (high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop) may be designed
by the translation of low-pass designs.
Transfer Functions of Filters
Filter design, whether active or passive, involves the determination of a suitable circuit topology and the
computation of the circuit component values within the topology, such that the desired frequency response is
obtained. The frequency response is commonly speciﬁed by the voltage transfer function H(s), which is a
rational function of the complex frequency variable s. For an nth-order ﬁlter, the denominator of H(s) will be
an nth-order polynomial in s and the numerator of H(s) will be a polynomial in s of up to nth-order. For
example, the transfer function of a second-order ﬁlter can be expressed as
HðsÞ ¼ b2s2 þ b1s þ b0
s2 þ a1s þ a0
ð8:1Þ
8-1

where s is the complex frequency and the ai and bj are constant coefﬁcients. The roots of the denominator are
the poles, and the roots of the numerator are the zeros. Therefore, the transfer function can also be written in
the form:
HðsÞ ¼
k Q
n
i¼1
s  zi


Q
n
j¼1
s  pi


ð8:2Þ
where the zi are the zeros of the transfer function, the pi are the poles of the transfer function, and k is
a constant. Filters with high selectivity (a steep transition between the passband and stopband) have com-
plex conjugate pole-pairs. Often the frequency response information is displayed graphically using a Bode plot.
The Bode plot involves a graph of the voltage gain in decibels (20 log10 H jo



) as a function of frequency, and
the phase angle (—H jo

) as a function of frequency. For most applications, however, the phase response
is of secondary importance and the ﬁlter speciﬁcations may be given entirely in terms of the amplitude
response.
Figure 8.1 shows an example of a frequency response speciﬁcation for a low-pass ﬁlter. According to this
speciﬁcation, the passband gain (for frequencies less than o1) should be between (1  d1) and 1. In the
stopband (for frequencies greater than o2), the response should be less than d2. Also shown in Figure 8.1 is the
response of a Butterworth ﬁlter which meets the given speciﬁcations.
Modern low-pass ﬁlter designs are usually based on one of these four classical types: Butterworth, Chebyshev,
Elliptic, or Bessel. Each of these is optimum in a particular sense and therefore well-suited to certain
applications. The Butterworth ﬁlter is optimum in the sense that its passband response is optimally ﬂat, i.e., for
an nth-order Butterworth ﬁlter the ﬁrst 2n1 derivatives of the response are zero at zero frequency. Also, the
response of the Butterworth ﬁlter is monotonic with no ripple. The Chebyshev ﬁlter is optimum in the sense
that it gives the steepest transition from passband to stopband, for a given order n, among all-pole ﬁlters.
However, it exhibits ripple in the passband. The Elliptic ﬁlter is optimum in the sense that it gives the steepest
transition from passband to stopband, for a given order n. However, it introduces ripple in the stopband as
well as the passband. The Bessel ﬁlter is optimum in the sense that it introduces a linear phase shift, and
therefore a constant propagation delay for different frequency components. Inﬁnitely many other ﬁlter designs
are possible, but these four prototypes are a good starting point because of their special characteristics. Other
types of responses, such as high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop, may be obtained from translated low-pass
forms or their combinations.

The nth-order Butterworth ﬁlter has n poles which lie on a unit circle in the complex frequency plane. The
Butterworth ﬁlter also has n zeros; however, because they all occur at o ¼ inﬁnity, this ﬁlter is usually called an
all-pole design. Figure 8.1 shows the pole-zero plot of a Butterworth ﬁlter and its amplitude response. Table 8.1
gives the pole locations for Butterworth ﬁlters up to the tenth order.
Chebyshev Filter
Compared to the Butterworth design, the Chebyshev1 ﬁlter exhibits a steeper rolloff in the stopband. In fact,
the Chebyshev ﬁlter exhibits the steepest rolloff available from a ﬁlter having only poles. However, it sacriﬁces
monotonicity in the passband. The transfer function for an nth-order Chebyshev ﬁlter is devised so that the

The nth-order Chebyshev ﬁlter has n poles which lie on an ellipse in the complex frequency plane. As with the
Butterworth ﬁlter, the zeros all occur at o ¼ inﬁnity and do not appear explicitly in the transfer function.
Figure 8.2 shows the pole-zero plot of a ﬁfth-order Chebyshev ﬁlter and its amplitude response. Table 8.2 to
Table 8.5 give the pole locations for Chebyshev ﬁlters up to tenth order, for the cases of 0.1 dB, 0.2 dB, 0.5 dB,
and 1 dB passband ripple, respectively.
Bessel Filter
The Bessel ﬁlter achieves phase shift which increases linearly with frequency. This results in a uniform
propagation delay for different frequency components, thus improving the transient response. This is achieved
by pushing the poles out from the unit circle in the s-plane as shown in Figure 8.3. However, this results in a
more gradual passband–stopband transition than even the Butterworth ﬁlter. Therefore, a higher order ﬁlter
will be needed to achieve a given bandedge selectivity. Figure 8.3 shows the pole-zero plot of a Bessel ﬁlter and
its amplitude response. Table 8.6 gives the pole locations for Bessel ﬁlters up to tenth order.

The elliptic ﬁlter is optimum in the sense that it provides the steepest transition from passband to stopband,

pole-zero plot of an elliptic ﬁlter and its amplitude response. Table 8.7 and Table 8.8 give the pole and zero
locations for Bessel ﬁlters with 0.5 dB passband ripple and 20 dB stopband rejection (Table 8.7) and for 0.1 dB
passband ripple and 40 dB stopband rejection (Table 8.8).
Passive Filter Synthesis
A passive low-pass ﬁlter may be designed using the LCR ladder structure shown in Figure 8.5.
The network shown is a ﬁfth-order ﬁlter, but higher-order ﬁlters may be implemented by adding elements,
while preserving the series inductor/parallel capacitor pattern. The drawback of this passive design is the need

for inductors. Inductors present a number of practical problems, including their large series resistance, large
physical size, and their coupling with electromagnetic ﬁelds. Furthermore, it is impractical to implement any
but the very smallest values of inductance on integrated circuits. To avoid these problems, active ﬁlters
incorporating only resistors and capacitors may be used.
Active Filter Synthesis
The design of a ﬁlter starts with required response, usually in the form of the amplitude response. The type of
ﬁlter can be determined based on the detailed speciﬁcations. A maximally ﬂat passband response dictates a
Butterworth design. If a ﬂat passband response is not required, sharper cutoff characteristics can be obtained
in lower-order ﬁlters using Chebyshev or elliptic ﬁlters. If constant propagation delay is important, then a
Bessel ﬁlter may be employed. Once the basic type of ﬁlter has been selected, the order of the ﬁlter is
determined based on the steepness of the transition from passband to stopband.
An nth-order active ﬁlter can be synthesized by cascading second-order sections. If n is odd, an additional
ﬁrst-order section may be added. The process requires ﬁrst the determination of the transfer function, or
equivalently, the pole and zero positions in the s-plane. Computer tools such as MATLABTM are used extensively
to determine the required poles and zeros to obtain the desired ﬁlter response. Then individual second-order
sections can be designed to provide the required second-order polynomials in the denominator and numerator
(the required poles and zeros) of the transfer function. If the preceding design tables are used, then the pair
of complex conjugate poles a ^ jb corresponds to a quadratic term in the denominator of the form:

Two commonly used types of second-order sections are the Sallen and Key and the state variable biquad.
However, the same design process can be used with other second-order circuit designs.
Sallen and Key Section
A Sallen and Key second-order ﬁlter section takes the form shown in Figure 8.6 (Sallen and Key, 1955). Its
transfer function is given by

This is an all-pole form since the numerator involves only a constant (there are no ﬁnite zeros). However, this
is entirely adequate for the realization of Butterworth, Chebyshev, or Bessel ﬁlters.

Component Scaling
Once a prototype ﬁlter has been designed, the resistors and capacitors may be scaled to values that are practical
for implementation. Typically, a prototype ﬁlter is designed using all 1 O resistors and with a cutoff frequency
of 1 rad/sec. In practical active ﬁlters, the resistors should all be greater than 1 kO to avoid overloading the op
amps and less than 1 MO to minimize electrical noise. If all resistors in the prototype are scaled up by a factor
of 104 while all capacitors are scaled down by a factor of 104, the frequency response will be left unchanged.
A different scaling factor may be used if necessary, as long as the RC products are left unchanged.
Frequency Scaling
Typically, a prototype ﬁlter is designed with a cutoff frequency of 1 rad/sec. The cutoff frequency can be readily
scaled up by simply scaling down all capacitors. For example, to scale the cutoff frequency up to 10 kHz, all
capacitors would be scaled down by a factor of 1= 2p · 104

. However, it is prudent to keep all capacitors
greater than 100 pF to minimize the effects of parasitic capacitances in the devices and circuit board.
Sensitivity and Stability
Once a ﬁlter has been completely designed, the circuit should be veriﬁed using a circuit simulation program
such as SPICE. All component tolerances should be taken into account for such veriﬁcation, and not just the
nominal component values. Some ﬁlter circuits, such as higher-order Elliptic and Chebyshev ﬁlters, have poles
that are very close to the jo axis. It is especially important in these cases to make sure that the component
tolerances will not cause one or more poles to appear in the right half of the s-plane, which would result in an
unstable ﬁlter.

Consider the design of a ﬁfth-order Chebyshev ﬁlter with unity passband gain, 0.5 dB passband ripple, and
a rolloff frequency of 10 kHz. From Table 8.4, the pole positions for the 1 rad/sec prototype are 0.1120
^ j 1.0116, 0.2931 ^ j 0.6252, and 0.3623, with k ¼ 0.1789. The required transfer function is therefore:

This transfer function can be realized by cascading two Sallen and Key sections and one ﬁrst-order section as
shown in Figure 8.8.

Equation (8.21) and Equation (8.22) simultaneously for C1 and C2, we obtain C1 ¼ 0.6512 F and C2 ¼ 3.6140 F.

verify the ﬁnal design using a circuit analysis tool such as SPICE to ensure that the ﬁlter response is still within
the speciﬁcations.
Fourth-Order Elliptic Filter Design Example
Consider the design of a fourth-order elliptic ﬁlter with unity passband gain, 0.5 dB passband ripple, 20 dB
stopband rejection, and a rolloff frequency of 10 kHz. From Table 8.7, the pole positions for the 1 rad/sec
prototype are 0.4950 ^ j 0.6673 and 0.0726 ^ j 1.0217, and the zero positions are at ^ j 1.1743 and
^ j 2.2268, and k ¼ 0.1000. The required transfer function for the 1 rad/sec prototype is therefore

The design for the fourth-order elliptic ﬁlter appears in Figure 8.11. Once standard value components have
been chosen, the entire design should be veriﬁed using SPICE.
Switched Capacitor Filters
Active ﬁlters provide a great deal of design ﬂexibility and use only standard op amps, capacitors, and resistors.
However, the values of the resistors and capacitors in active ﬁlters are large enough to preclude their
monolithic integration. Moreover, integrated capacitors are usually subject to tolerances as large as 30% due to
process variations. Switched capacitor (SC) ﬁlters avoid these problems while providing unique capabilities
(Taylor and Huang, 1997; Schaumann and van Valkenburg, 2001; Ghausi and Laker, 2003). First, resistors are
not needed in SC ﬁlters. Second, the frequency response for an SC ﬁlter depends on ratios of capacitors, which
can be controlled much more tightly than their absolute values. Third, the frequency response of an SC ﬁlter
scales with the clock frequency, and can be changed as needed.
A basic SC ﬁlter is shown in Figure 8.12. The switch (implemented using metal oxide semiconductor ﬁeld
effect transistors, or MOSFETs) is toggled at a frequency fCLK. Each time the switch toggles to the left-hand
side, a charge of C1VIN is placed on the capacitor C1. This charge is then transferred to the inverting input of
the op amp when the switch toggles to the right-hand side. The average current delivered to the inverting
input of the op amp is thus VINC1fCLK, and so the switch–capacitor combination emulates a resistor of value
1/(C1fCLK). The transfer function for the SC ﬁlter shown in Figure 8.12 is therefore:
H sð Þ ¼  fCLKC1
sC2
ð8:39Þ
This is therefore a ﬁrst-order low-pass ﬁlter with a single pole at the origin of the s-plane. The rolloff frequency
of the ﬁlter is (C2/C1)( fCLK/2p), which depends on the ratio of the capacitors but not their absolute values.
Also, the rolloff frequency can be changed by the alteration of the clock frequency.
The SC ﬁlter can be generalized to higher-order ﬁlters of various types. Second-order SC sections can be
derived from the Sallen and Key and state variable biquad designs. All that is required is that each resistor be
replaced by a capacitor and the associated MOSFET switch transistors.

Monolithic SC ﬁlters are readily available and typically require only a small number of external resistors
and/or jumpers to conﬁgure their frequency response characteristics. The clock frequency is usually derived by
an external quartz crystal oscillator and can be set very precisely as needed. A detailed description of SC ﬁlter
theory is beyond the scope of this chapter, but can be found in Ghausi and Laker (2003) and Schaumann and
Van Valkenburg (2001).

Realization
J.W. Steadman and B.M. Wilamowski
After the appropriate low-pass form of a given ﬁlter has been synthesized, the designer must address the
realization of the ﬁlter using operational ampliﬁers. If the required ﬁlter is not low-pass but high-pass,
bandpass, or bandstop, transformation of the prototype function is also required (Budak, 1974; Van
Valkenburg, 1982). While a detailed treatment of the various transformations is beyond the scope of this work,
most of the ﬁlter designs encountered in practice can be accomplished using the techniques given here.
When the desired ﬁlter function has been determined, the corresponding electronic circuit must be designed.
Many different circuits can be used to realize any given transfer function. For purposes of this Handbook, we
present several of the most popular types of realizations. Much more detailed information on various circuit
realizations and the advantages of each may be found in the literature, in particular Van Valkenburg (1982),
Huelseman and Allen (1980), and Chen (1986). Generally the design trade-offs in making the choice of circuit
to be used for the realization involve considerations of the number of elements required, the sensitivity of the
circuit to changes in component values, and the ease of tuning the circuit to given speciﬁcations. Accordingly,
limited information is included about these characteristics of the example circuits in this section.
Each of the circuits described here is commonly used in the realization of active ﬁlters. When implemented
as shown and used in the appropriate gain and bandwidth speciﬁcations of the ampliﬁers, they will provide
excellent performance. Computer-aided ﬁlter design programs are available which simplify the process of
obtaining proper element values and simulation of the resulting circuits (Krobe et al., 1989; Wilamowski et al.,
1992).
Transformation from Low-Pass to Other Filter Types
To obtain a high-pass, bandpass, or bandstop ﬁlter function from a low-pass prototype, one of two general
methods can be used. In one of these, the circuit is realized and then individual circuit elements are replaced by
other elements or subcircuits. This method is more useful in passive ﬁlter designs and is not discussed further
here. In the other approach, the transfer function of the low-pass prototype is transformed into the required
form for the desired ﬁlter. Then a circuit is chosen to realize the new ﬁlter function. We give a brief description
of the transformation in this section, then give examples of circuit realizations in the following sections.
Low-Pass to High-Pass Transformation
Suppose the desired ﬁlter is, for example, a high-pass Butterworth. Begin with the low-pass Butterworth
transfer function of the desired order and then transform each pole of the original function using the formula:
1
S  Sj
! Hs
s  sj
ð8:40Þ
which results in one complex pole and one zero at the origin for each pole in the original function. Similarly,
each zero of the original function is transformed using the formula:
S  Sj ! s  sj
Hs
ð8:41Þ
which results in one zero on the imaginary axis and one pole at the origin. In both equations, the scaling
factors used are
H ¼ 1
Sj
and
sj ¼ o0
Sj
ð8:42Þ
where o0 is the desired cut-off frequency in radians per second.

using the formula:
1
S  Sj

ð8:44Þ
resulting in one pole at origin and two conjugate zeros. In Equation (8.43) and Equation (8.44):

where oc is the center frequency and B is the bandwidth of the bandpass function.

using the formula:
1
S  Sj
! Hðs  s1Þðs  s2Þ
ðs  s3Þðs  s4Þ
ð8:46Þ
transforming each pole into two zeros on the imaginary axis and into two conjugate poles. Similarly, each zero
is transformed into two poles on the imaginary axis and into two conjugate zeros using the formula:
S  Sj ! ðs  s3Þðs  s4Þ
Hðs  s1Þðs  s2Þ

Once the desired transfer function has been obtained through obtaining the appropriate low-pass prototype
and transformation, if necessary, to the associated high-pass, bandpass, or bandstop function, all that remains
is to obtain a circuit and the element values to realize the transfer function.
Circuit Realizations
Various electronic circuits can be found to implement any given transfer function. Cascade ﬁlters and
ladder ﬁlters are two of the basic approaches for obtaining a practical circuit. Cascade realizations are
much easier to ﬁnd and to tune, but ladder ﬁlters are less sensitive to element variations. In cascade
realizations, the transfer function is simply factored into ﬁrst- and second-order parts. Circuits are built
for the individual parts and then cascaded to produce the overall ﬁlter. For simple to moderately complex
ﬁlter designs, this is the most common method, and the remainder of this section is devoted to several
examples of the circuits used to obtain the ﬁrst- and second-order ﬁlters. For very high-order transfer
8-20
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

functions, ladder ﬁlters should be considered, and further information can be obtained by consulting the
literature.
In order to simplify the circuit synthesis procedure, very often o0 is assumed to be equal to one and then
after a circuit is found, the values of all capacitances in the circuit are divided by o0. In general, the following
magnitude and frequency transformations are allowed:
Rnew ¼ KMRold and Cnew ¼
1
KFKM
Cold
ð8:49Þ
where KM and KF are magnitude and frequency scaling factors, respectively.
Cascade ﬁlter designs require the transfer function to be expressed as a product of ﬁrst- and second-order
terms. For each of these terms a practical circuit can be implemented. Examples of these circuits are presented in
Figure 8.13 to Figure 8.23. In general the following ﬁrst- and second-order terms can be distinguished:
(a) First-order low-pass:
TðsÞ ¼ Ho0
s þ o0
Assumption: r1 ¼ 1
c1 ¼ 1
o0
r2 ¼ jHjo0
This ﬁlter is inverting, i.e., H must be negative, and the scaling factors shown in Equation (8.49) should be
used to obtain reasonable values for the components.
(b) First-order high-pass:
TðsÞ ¼
Hs
s þ o0
Assumption: r1 ¼ 1
c1 ¼ 1
o0
r2 ¼ jHj
This ﬁlter is inverting, i.e., H must be negative, and the scaling factors shown in Equation (8.49) should be
used to obtain reasonable values for the components.
While several passive realizations of ﬁrst-order ﬁlters are possible (low-pass, high-pass, and lead-lag), the
active circuits shown here are inexpensive and avoid any loading of the other ﬁlter sections when the
individual circuits are cascaded. Consequently, these circuits are preferred unless there is some reason to avoid
the use of the additional operational ampliﬁer. Note that a second-order ﬁlter can be realized using one
operational amplifer as shown in the following paragraphs, so it is common practice to choose even-order
transfer functions, thus avoiding the use of any ﬁrst-order ﬁlters.

This ﬁlter is noninverting and unity gain, i.e., H must be one, and the scaling factors shown in Equation (8.49)
should be used to obtain reasonable element values. This is a very popular ﬁlter for realizing second-order
functions because it uses a minimum number of components and since the operation ampliﬁer is in the unity
gain conﬁguration it has very good bandwidth.
Another useful conﬁguration for second-order low-pass ﬁlters uses the operational ampliﬁer in its inverting
‘‘inﬁnite gain’’ mode as shown in Figure 8.16.

This circuit has the advantage of relatively low sensitivity of o0 and Q to variations in component values.
In this conﬁguration the operational ampliﬁer’s gain–bandwidth product may become a limitation for high-Q
and high-frequency applications (Budak, 1974). There are several other circuit conﬁgurations for low-pass
ﬁlters. The references given at the end of the section will guide the designer to alternatives and the advantages
of each.
(d) Second-order high-pass ﬁlters may be designed using circuits very much like those shown for the low-
pass realizations. For example, the Sallen–Key low-pass ﬁlter is shown in Figure 8.17.

As in the case of the low-pass Sallen–Key ﬁlter, this circuit is noninverting and requires very little gain from
the operational ampliﬁer. For low to moderate values of Q, the sensitivity functions are reasonable and the
circuit performs well.
The inverting inﬁnite gain high-pass circuit is shown in Figure 8.18 and is similar to the corresponding
low-pass circuit:
This circuit has relatively good sensitivity ﬁgures. The principal limitation occurs with high-Q ﬁlters since
this requires a wide spread of resistor values.
Both low-pass and high-pass frequency response circuits can be achieved using three operational ampliﬁer
circuits. Such circuits have some sensitivity function and tuning advantages but require far more components.
These circuits are used in the sections describing bandpass and bandstop ﬁlters. The designer wanting to use
the three-operational-ampliﬁer realization for low-pass or high-pass ﬁlters can easily do this using simple
modiﬁcations of the circuits shown in the following sections.
(e) Second-order bandpass circuits may be realized using only one operational ampliﬁer. The Sallen–Key
ﬁlter shown in Figure 8.19 is one such circuit:
This is a noninverting ampliﬁer that works well for low- to moderate-Q ﬁlters and is easily tuned
(Budak, 1974). For high-Q ﬁlters the sensitivity of Q to element values becomes high, and alternative
circuits are recommended. One of these is the bandpass version of the inverting ampliﬁer ﬁlter as shown in
Figure 8.20.

This circuit has few components and relatively small sensitivity of o0 and Q to variations in element values.
For high-Q circuits, the range of resistor values is quite large as r1 and r2 are much larger than r3.
When ease of tuning and small sensitivities are more important than the circuit complexity, the three-
operational-ampliﬁer circuit of Figure 8.21 may be used to implement the bandpass transfer function.
The ﬁlter as shown in Figure 8.21 is inverting. For a noninverting realization, simply take the output from
the middle ampliﬁer rather than the right one. This same conﬁguration can be used for a three-operational-
ampliﬁer low-pass ﬁlter by putting the input into the summing junction of the middle ampliﬁer and taking
the output from the left operational ampliﬁer. Note that Q may be changed in this circuit by varying r1 and
that this will not alter o0. Similarly, o0 can be adjusted by varying c1 or c2 and this will not change Q. If only
variable resistors are to be used, the ﬁlter can be tuned by setting o0 using any of the resistors other than r1 and
then setting Q using r1.
(f) Second-order bandstop ﬁlters are very useful in rejecting unwanted signals such as line noise or carrier
frequencies in instrumentation applications. Such ﬁlters are implemented with methods very similar to the
bandpass ﬁlters just discussed. In most cases, the frequency of the zeros is to be the same as the frequency of
the poles. For this application, the circuit shown in Figure 8.22 can be used.

applications where no tuning is required and the Q is low, this circuit works very well. When the bandstop
ﬁlter must be tuned, the three-operational-ampliﬁer circuit is preferable.
The foregoing circuits provide a variety of useful ﬁrst- and second-order ﬁlters. For higher-order ﬁlters,
these sections are simply cascaded to realize the overall transfer function desired. Additional details about
these circuits as well as other circuits used for active ﬁlters may be found in the references.

Power Semiconductor Devices
Andrew Marshall
The era of semiconductor power devices began with the availability of thyristors in the late 1950s. Now, there
are several types of power devices available for high-voltage, high-current, and high-power applications. These
are used for power conversion and motor control systems. Particularly noteworthy are gate turn-off thyristors,
Darlington transistors, power MOSFETs, and insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) (Bird and King, 1984).
This section reviews the basic characteristics of the most common of these.
Thyristor
The thyristor, also called a silicon-controlled rectiﬁer (SCR), is a four-layer three-junction pnpn device. It has
three terminals: anode, cathode, and gate (Figure 9.1), and is turned on by applying a short current pulse into
9-1

the gate. Once the device turns on, the gate loses its control to turn off the device. Turn-off is achieved by
applying a zero or reverse voltage across the anode and cathode.
Some thyristors include what is termed an amplifying gate. In this conﬁguration a small auxiliary thyristor
is placed in parallel with the power SCR. The two devices’ anodes are common and the cathode of the auxiliary
device is connected to the gate of the power device. This allows the power device to be switched on with
substantially reduced current, at the cost of slightly higher voltage.
In cases where electrical isolation is required between the power supply and gate control, a light-activated
SCR may be considered. In these applications a light pulse onto the thyristor triggers it. From an electrical
schematic point of view this appears as a thyristor with its gate connected to its anode through a light-sensitive
resistor or diode.
There are two major classiﬁcations of thyristor: converter grade and inverter grade. Converter-grade
thyristors are slow (turn-off measured in tens of milliseconds) and are used in natural commutation (or phase-
controlled) applications. Inverter-grade thyristors are used in forced commutation applications such as dc–dc
choppers and dc–ac inverters, where faster turn-off is required. Inverter-grade thyristors may be turned off by
forcing current to zero using an external commutation circuit. While providing improved switching times, this
results in circuit losses and increased circuit complexity.
Thyristors have high di/dt and dv/dt capabilities. These are, respectively, the maximum permitted rate of
change of current through a device and rate of change of voltage across the device beyond which failure may
occur. Thyristors are available that can stand off up to around 6000 V, and with current ratings of several
thousand amperes. The on-state forward voltage drop in thyristors (the voltage across the device when the
anode is positive with respect to the cathode) is about 1.5 to 2 V, and this does not increase much even at very
high currents. While the forward voltage determines the on-state power loss of the device at any given current,
the switching power loss becomes dominant at high frequencies. Because of this, the maximum switching
frequencies possible using thyristors are limited in comparison with other power devices considered in this
section. In many applications protection against excessive switching rates is required to prevent thyristor turn-
on without a gate pulse, which can occur as a result of capacitive coupling from anode to gate. In dc-to-ac
conversion applications it is necessary to use an antiparallel diode of similar rating across each power thyristor
to protect the thyristor from reverse damage.
Gate Turn-Off Thyristor (GTO)
The GTO is a power switching device that can be turned on by a short pulse of gate current and turned off by a
reverse gate pulse. This reverse gate current amplitude is dependent on the anode current being turned off;
hence, there is no need for an external commutation circuit to turn it off. Because turn-off is provided by
FIGURE 9.1

characteristics.

bypassing carriers directly to the gate circuit, its turn-off
time is short, providing higher-frequency operation than
thyristors. The GTO symbol and turn-off characteristics
are shown in Figure 9.2.
For reliable operation of GTOs, proper design of the
gate
turn-off
circuit
and
the
snubber
circuit
are
critical. AGTO has a poor turn-off current gain of
the order of 4 to 5. Thus, a 1000-A peak current GTO
may require 200 A of reverse gate current. GTO
devices also have an increased tendency to latch at
temperatures above 125–C. GTOs are available with
similar ratings to SCRs.
Triac
The triac (Figure 9.3) is functionally a pair of thyristors
connected in antiparallel. The result is a two-directional
switch that can conduct current in both directions. It is
turned on with a positive or negative voltage, and
turns off when the current through the device drops
below a threshold value. Because of the integration,
the triac has poor gate current sensitivity at turn-on
and a longer turn-off time than thyristors. Also triacs
have a poor capability to withstand reapplied dv/dt
(voltage appearing across the device during turn-off,
due usually to inductive commutation). Triacs are
mainly used in low-frequency phase control applica-
tions, such as in ac regulators for lighting, fan control, and in solid-state ac relays. Triacs are not available to
the same ratings as thyristors, having typical ratings of up to about 1000 V and a few tens of amperes.
Reverse-Conducting Thyristor (RCT) and Asymmetrical Silicon-Controlled
Rectiﬁer (ASCR)
It is usual in power inverter applications to add an
antiparallel diode between the thyristor anode and cathode
for commutation/freewheeling purposes (Figure 9.4). In
RCTs, the diode is integrated with a fast switching thyristor
in a single silicon chip, and thus component count may be
reduced. This integration improves the static and dynamic
characteristics as well as the overall circuit performance.
RCTs are usually designed for speciﬁc applications such as
motor drivers. The antiparallel diode limits the reverse
voltage across the thyristor (the voltage across the device
when the anode is negative with respect to the cathode) to
between 1 and 2 V. However, because of the reverse recovery behavior of the integrated diodes, the thyristor
may see very high reapplied dv/dt when the diode recovers from its reverse voltage (Whitaker, 1998).
The ASCR has a similar forward blocking capability as a power inverter-grade thyristor, but it has a limited
reverse blocking capability of about 20 to 30 V. It has a reduced on-state voltage drop and faster turn-off rate
than a thyristor of similar rating.

MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT)
The MCT combines the beneﬁts of thyristor current density with MOS gated turn-on and turn-off. It is a
rugged high-power, high-frequency component with low conduction drop when used in medium- to high-
power applications. A cross-sectional structure of a p-type MCT with its circuit schematic is shown in
Figure 9.5. Most MCTs are constructed of multiple parallel cells. The device is turned on by a negative voltage
pulse at the gate with respect to the anode, and is turned off by a positive voltage pulse.
Compared to IGBTs, MCTs have a lower forward voltage drop and improved reverse bias safe operating area
and switching speed. The MCT is capable of high current densities and blocking voltages in both directions.
An MCT has high di/dt (of the order of 2500 A/msec) and high dv/dt (of the order of 20,000 V/msec) capability.
It is often a good choice for applications such as motor drives, uninterrupted power supplies, and high-power
active power line conditioners (Temple, 1989).
Power Transistors and Darlingtons
Power transistors are used in applications ranging up to several hundred kilowatts, at voltages up to a few
kilovolts, and switching frequencies up to about 10 kHz. Power transistors used in power conversion
applications are generally npn-type for reasons of efﬁciency, processing simplicity, and cost. The power transistor
is turned on by supplying current to the base, which has to be maintained throughout the conduction period. It
is turned off by removing the base drive and may be speeded up by making the base voltage slightly negative. This
permits the more rapid removal of charge from the base region. The saturation voltage of the device is normally
0.5 to 2.5 V and increases with current; hence the on-state losses increase more than proportionately with
current. In addition, power transistors can block only forward voltages, with reverse peak voltage rating of these
devices only a few volts.
Because of their relatively long switching times, switching losses are signiﬁcant, limiting the maximum
operating frequency. During switching, the reverse-biased collector junction may show hot-spot breakdown
(where current ﬂows preferentially through one part of the device, causing it to heat up) due to exceeding the
safe operating area (SOA). Bipolar devices have highly
interdigitated emitter-base geometries to force more
uniform current distribution and improve the SOA.
To reduce high base current requirements, Darlington
conﬁgurations are commonly used. They are available as
monolithic and multichip versions. The basic Darlington
conﬁguration (Figure 9.6) can considerably increase the
current switched by the transistor for a given base drive,
although the VCE(sat) for the Darlington is generally
higher than that of a single transistor of similar rating
with corresponding increase in on-state power loss.

Some Darlington devices use a high-gain T1 and low-gain T2 device to improve SOA. The improved SOA
results from an early nondestructive BVcbo breakdown of T1, which turns on T2, into a robust FBSOA
conduction state before RBSOA of T2 can occur. Faster turn-off is provided by the integration of a diode from
what is often an internal B2 to external B1 node. Thus, for turn-off of a Darlington with integrated speed-up
diode the base must be switched more than a Vd below ground to take advantage of the feature.
Power MOSFET
Various types of power MOSFETs are available with
differences in internal geometry; examples include the
VDMOS, HEXFET, SIPMOS, and TMOS. All power
MOSFETs are voltage-driven rather than current-driven
devices, unlike bipolar transistors. They are also the most
common power device type used in power ICs, although
most discrete power MOSFETs use the bottom of the
wafer as the drain contact, whereas integrated circuit
power MOSFETs bring all the device’s terminals out to the
top surface. MOSFETs are available with ratings up to
about 1000 V and a few hundred watts.
As with conventional MOSFETS, the gate of a power MOSFET is isolated electrically from the source by an
insulating layer, often of silicon dioxide. The gate draws only a very small leakage current of the order of
nanoamperes. Hence, the gate drive circuit is simple and dc power loss is minimal. Under switching conditions,
however, capacitive losses occur as gate-to-source, and gate-to-drain capacitances have to be charged
and discharged. The circuit symbol and silicon cross-section of a DMOS-type power MOSFET is shown in
Figure 9.7.
Power MOSFETs are majority carrier devices and display no minority carrier storage time, leading to fast
rise and fall times. They behave as resistive devices when turned on. At low currents a power MOSFET may
have a lower conduction loss than a comparable bipolar device, but at higher currents, the conduction losses
exceed those of bipolars. In addition, the Rds (on) increases with temperature, where bipolar performance
may not necessarily increase with temperature, dependent upon current density.
An important feature of a power MOSFET is the absence of a secondary breakdown effect. As a result it has
a more rugged switching performance than a bipolar device. In MOSFETs, Rds(on) increases with
temperature, and thus current is automatically diverted away from hot spots, providing an added level of SOA
stability. The drain body junction appears as an anti-parallel diode between source and drain. Thus, power
MOSFETs will not support voltage in the reverse direction. Although this inverse diode is relatively fast, it is
slow by comparison with the MOSFET. In high-performance commutating systems, where the diode may be
forced to conduct, an external, fast recovery diode is often placed in parallel with the internal diode to achieve
the circuit performance required.
If a MOSFET is operating within its speciﬁcation range at all times, its chances of failing catastrophically are
minimal. However, if its absolute maximum rating is exceeded, failure probability increases dramatically.
Under actual operating conditions, a MOSFET may be subjected to transients—either externally from the
power bus supplying the circuit or from the circuit itself due, for example, to inductive kicks going beyond the
absolute maximum ratings. A combination of transistor and circuit design provide the ruggedness required for
a MOSFET to operate in an environment of dynamic electrical stresses without activating any of the parasitic
bipolar junction transistors inherent to most MOSFETs.
Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
The IGBT has the high input impedance and high-speed characteristics of a MOSFET with the conductivity
characteristic (low saturation voltage) of a bipolar transistor. The IGBT is turned on by applying a positive
voltage between the gate and emitter and, as in the MOSFET, it is turned off by making the gate signal zero

or slightly negative. The IGBT has a much lower
voltage drop than a MOSFET of similar ratings. For a
given IGBT, there is a critical value of collector current
that will cause a large enough voltage drop to activate
the thyristor. Hence, the peak allowable collector
current that can ﬂow without latch-up occurring is a
characteristic which is speciﬁed in the datasheet, and
must be adhered to in the circuit design. There is also a
corresponding gate source voltage that permits this
current to ﬂow, which also should not be exceeded.
Like the power MOSFET, the IGBT does not exhibit
the secondary breakdown phenomenon common to
bipolar transistors. However, care should be taken not to exceed the maximum power dissipation and speciﬁed
maximum junction temperature of the device under all conditions for guaranteed reliable operation. The on-
state voltage of the IGBT is heavily dependent on the gate voltage. To obtain a low on-state voltage, a
sufﬁciently high gate voltage must be applied.
In general, IGBTs can be classiﬁed into punch-through (PT) and nonpunch-through (NPT) structures, as
shown in Figure 9.8. In the PT IGBT, an Nþ buffer layer is normally introduced between the Pþ substrate and the
N epitaxial layer, so that the whole N drift region is depleted when the device is blocking the off-state voltage,
and the electrical ﬁeldshape inside the N drift region is close to a rectangularshape. Becausea shorter N region
can be used in the PT IGBT, a better trade-off between the forwardvoltagedrop and turn-off time can be achieved.
PT IGBTs are available up to about 1200 V. High-voltage IGBTs normally use NPT processing, and are built on
N substrates which serve as the N base drift region. NPT IGBTs of up to about 4 kV have been reported. NPT
IGBTs are more robust than PT IGBTs, particularly under short-circuit conditions, but have a higher forward
voltage drop.
The PT IGBTs should not normally be paralleled. Factors that inhibit current sharing of parallel-connected
IGBTs are: (1) on-state current unbalance, caused by Vce(sat) distribution and circuit resistance, and (2)
current unbalance at turn-on and turn-off, caused by the switching time differences between the parallel
connected devices and wiring inductance. NPT IGBTs may be paralleled as they have a positive temperature
coefﬁcient, and thus evenly distribute current.
Alternative Materials
Most power semiconductors are fabricated on bulk silicon (where the starting material is a large wafer of
silicon cut from a monocrystalline ingot). Alternative starting materials have a variety of advantages for certain
power semiconductors, including silicon carbide, silicon-on-insulator, and III–V materials.
Development continues in silicon carbide power MOSFETs and thyristors. With their wider bandgap these
permit operation to greater than 300–C, with promise of excellent switching characteristics and higher and
more stable blocking voltages.
SOI has been used for a number of years for logic
devices, giving SOI the advantage of being readily
available and well understood (Marshall, Udrea). SOI
has numerous advantages and drawbacks. It is readily
integratable, without DC paths that can lead to latch-up.
The most common SOI power device is the lateral DMOS
(LDMOS)
conﬁguration,
which
is
similar
to
the
VDMOS, but the drain terminal is accessed from the
top surface of the silicon (Figure 9.9). SOI power
transistors have the advantage of high-temperature
operation and no need for isolation in integrated systems;
as a result, LDMOS devices are widely used in system-on-
a-chip solutions.

The most common III–V material for power devices is gallium nitride. In theory this material is capable of
extremely high power, with power densities approximately ﬁve times that of silicon. However, the major
difﬁculty has proved to be manufacturing low enough defect density GaN. Usually GaN is deposited as an
epitaxial layer on SiC, sapphire, or silicon. The high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is a popular III–V
power transistor. The HEMT bypasses the need for a highly doped channel in conventional MOS devices,
which slows the electron mobility. The structure is similar to a lateral MOS device, but the gate oxide is
replaced with a heavily doped semiconductor region.

Power Conversion
Kaushik Rajashekara
Power conversion deals with the process of converting electric power from one form to another. The power
electronic apparatuses performing the power conversion are called power converters. Because they contain no
moving parts, they are often referred to as static power converters. The power conversion is achieved using
power semiconductor devices, which are used as switches. The power devices used are SCRs (silicon controlled
rectiﬁers, or thyristors), triacs, power transistors, power MOSFETs, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs),
and MCTs (MOS-controlled thyristors). The power converters are generally classiﬁed as:
1. ac–dc converters (phase-controlled converters)
2. direct ac–ac converters (cycloconverters)
3. dc–ac converters (inverters)
4. dc–dc converters (choppers, buck, and boost converters)
ac–dc Converters
The basic function of a phase-controlled converter is to convert an alternating voltage of variable amplitude
and frequency to a variable dc voltage. The power devices used for this application are generally SCRs. The
average value of the output voltage is controlled by varying the conduction time of the SCRs. The turn-on of
the SCR is achieved by providing a gate pulse when it is forward-biased. The turn-off is achieved by the
commutation of current from one device to another at the instant the incoming ac voltage has a higher
instantaneous potential than that of the outgoing wave. Thus there is a natural tendency for current to be
commutated from the outgoing to the incoming SCR, without the aid of any external commutation circuitry.
This commutation process is often referred to as natural commutation.
A single-phase half-wave converter is shown in Figure 9.10. When the SCR is turned on at an angle a, full
supply voltage (neglecting the SCR drop) is applied to the load. For a purely resistive load, during the positive
9-7
Power Electronics

half cycle, the output voltage waveform follows the input ac voltage waveform. During the negative half cycle,
the SCR is turned off. In the case of inductive load, the energy stored in the inductance causes the current to
ﬂow in the load circuit even after the reversal of the supply voltage, as shown in Figure 9.10(b). If there is no
freewheeling diode DF, the load current is discontinuous. A freewheeling diode is connected across the load to
turn off the SCR as soon as the input voltage polarity reverses, as shown in Figure 9.11(c). When the SCR is off,
the load current will freewheel through the diode. The power ﬂows from the input to the load only when the
SCR is conducting. If there is no freewheeling diode, during the negative portion of the supply voltage, SCR
returns the energy stored in the load inductance to the supply. The freewheeling diode improves the input
power factor.
The controlled full-wave dc output may be obtained by using either a center tap transformer (Figure 9.11)
or by bridge conﬁguration (Figure 9.12). The bridge conﬁguration is often used when a transformer is
undesirable and the magnitude of the supply voltage properly meets the load voltage requirements. The
average output voltage of a single-phase full-wave converter for continuous current conduction is given by
vda ¼ 2 Em
p cos a
where Em is the peak value of the input voltage and a is the ﬁring angle. The output voltage of a single-phase
bridge circuit is the same as that shown in Figure 9.11. Various conﬁgurations of the single-phase bridge
circuit can be obtained if, instead of four SCRs, two diodes and two SCRs are used, with or without
freewheeling diodes.
A three-phase full-wave converter consisting of six thyristor switches is shown in Figure 9.13(a). This is
the most commonly used three-phase bridge conﬁguration. Thyristors T1, T3, and T5 are turned on during
the positive half cycle of the voltages of the phases to which they are connected, and thyristors T2, T4, and
T6 are turned on during the negative half cycle of the phase voltages. The reference for the angle in each

cycle is at the crossing points of the phase voltages. The ideal output voltage, output current, and input
current waveforms are shown in Figure 9.13(b). The output dc voltage is controlled by varying the ﬁring
angle a. The average output voltage under continuous current conduction operation is given by
vo ¼ 3
ﬃﬃ

p
p Em cos a
where Em is the peak value of the phase voltage. At a ¼ 90–, the output voltage is zero. For 0 , a , 90–, vo is
positive and power ﬂows from ac supply to the load. For 90– , a , 180–, vo is negative and the converter
operates in the inversion mode. If the load is a dc motor, the power can be transferred from the motor to the
ac supply, a process known as regeneration.
In Figure 9.13(a), the top or bottom thyristors could be replaced by diodes. The resulting topology is called
a thyristor semiconverter. With this conﬁguration, the input power factor is improved, but the regeneration is
not possible.

Cycloconverters
Cycloconverters are direct ac-to-ac frequency changers. The term direct conversion means that the energydoes not
appear in any form other than the ac input or ac output. The output frequency is lower than the input frequency
and is generally an integral multiple of the input frequency. A cycloconverter permits energy to be fed back into
the utility network without any additional measures. Also, the phase sequence of the output voltage can be easily
reversed by the control system. Cycloconverters have found applications in aircraft systems and industrial drives.
These cycloconverters are suitable for synchronous and induction motor control. The operation of the
cycloconverter is illustrated in Section ‘‘Converter Control of Machines’’ of this chapter.
dc-to-ac Converters
The dc-to-ac converters are generally called inverters. The ac supply is ﬁrst converted to dc, which is then
converted to a variable-voltage and variable-frequency power supply. This generally consists of a three-phase
bridge connected to the ac power source, a dc link with a ﬁlter, and the three-phase inverter bridge connected
to the load. In the case of battery-operated systems, there is no intermediate dc link. Inverters can be classiﬁed
as voltage source inverters (VSIs) and current source inverters (CSIs). A voltage source inverter is fed by a stiff
dc voltage, whereas a current source inverter is fed by a stiff current source. A voltage source can be converted
to a current source by connecting a series inductance and then varying the voltage to obtain the desired
current. AVSI can also be operated in current-controlled mode, and similarly a CSI can also be operated in the
voltage-control mode. The inverters are used in variable frequency ac motor drives, uninterrupted power
supplies, induction heating, static VAR compensators, etc.
Voltage Source Inverter
A three-phase voltage source inverter conﬁguration is shown in Figure 9.14(a). The VSIs are controlled either
in square-wave mode or in pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) mode. In square-wave mode, the frequency of the
output voltage is controlled within the inverter, the devices being used to switch the output circuit between the
plus and minus bus. Each device conducts for 180–, and each of the outputs is displaced 120– to generate a
six-step waveform, as shown in Figure 9.14(b). The amplitude of the output voltage is controlled by varying
the dc link voltage. This is done by varying the ﬁring angle of the thyristors of the three-phase bridge converter
at the input. The square-wave-type VSI is not suitable if the dc source is a battery. The six-step output voltage
is rich in harmonics and thus needs heavy ﬁltering.
In PWM inverters, the output voltage and frequency are controlled within the inverter by varying the width
of the output pulses. Hence at the front end, instead of a phase-controlled thyristor converter, a diode bridge
rectiﬁer can be used. A very popular method of controlling the voltage and frequency is by sinusoidal
pulsewidth modulation. In this method, a high-frequency triangle carrier wave is compared with a three-phase
sinusoidal waveform, as shown in Figure 9.15. The power devices in each phase are switched on at the
intersection of sine and triangle waves. The amplitude and frequency of the output voltage are varied,
respectively, by varying the amplitude and frequency of the reference sine waves. The ratio of the amplitude of
the sine wave to the amplitude of the carrier wave is called the modulation index.
The harmonic components in a PWM wave are easily ﬁltered because they are shifted to a higher-frequency
region. It is desirable to have a high ratio of carrier frequency to fundamental frequency to reduce the harmonics
of lower-frequency components. There are several other PWM techniques mentioned in the literature. The most
notable ones are selected harmonic elimination, hysteresis controller, and space vector PWM technique.
In inverters, if SCRs are used as power switching devices, an external forced commutation circuit has to
be used to turn off the devices. Now, with the availability of IGBTs above 1000-A, 1000-V ratings, they are
being used in applications up to 300-kW motor drives. Above this power rating, GTOs are generally used.
Power Darlington transistors, which are available up to 800 A, 1200 V, could also be used for inverter
applications.

Power Electronics

Current Source Inverter
Contrary to the voltage source inverter where the voltage of the dc link is imposed on the motor windings, in
the current source inverter the current is imposed into the motor. Here the amplitude and phase angle of the
motor voltage depend on the load conditions of the motor. The current source inverter is described in detail in
Section ‘‘Converter Control of Machines’’.
Resonant-Link Inverters
The use of resonant switching techniques can be applied to inverter topologies to reduce the switching losses
in the power devices. They also permit high switching frequency operation to reduce the size of the magnetic
components in the inverter unit. In the resonant dc-link inverter shown in Figure 9.16, a resonant circuit is
added at the inverter input to convert a ﬁxed dc voltage to a pulsating dc voltage. This resonant circuit enables
the devices to be turned on and turned off during the zero voltage interval. Zero voltage or zero current
switching is often termed soft switching. Under soft switching, the switching losses in the power devices are
almost eliminated. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem is less severe because resonant voltage
pulses have lower dv/dt compared to those of hard-switched PWM inverters. Also, the machine insulation is
less stretched because of lower dv/dt resonant voltage pulses. In Figure 9.16, all the inverter devices are turned

on simultaneously to initiate a resonant cycle. The commutation from one device to another is initiated at the
zero dc-link voltage. The inverter output voltage is formed by the integral numbers of quasi-sinusoidal pulses.
The circuit consisting of devices Q, D, and the capacitor C acts as an active clamp to limit the dc voltage to
about 1.4 times the diode rectiﬁer voltage Vs.
There are several other topologies of resonant link inverters mentioned in the literature. There are also
resonant link ac–ac converters based on bidirectional ac switches, as shown in Figure 9.17. These resonant link
converters ﬁnd applications in ac machine control and uninterrupted power supplies, induction heating, etc.
The resonant link inverter technology is still in the development stage for industrial applications.
dc–dc Converters
dc–dc converters are used to convert unregulated dc voltage to regulated or variable dc voltage at the output.
They are widely used in switch-mode dc power supplies and in dc motor drive applications. In dc motor
control applications, they are called chopper-controlled drives. The input voltage source is usually a battery or
derived from an ac power supply using a diode bridge rectiﬁer. These converters are generally either hard-
switched PWM types or soft-switched resonant-link types. There are several dc–dc converter topologies, the
most common ones being buck converter, boost converter, and buck–boost converter, shown in Figure 9.18.
Buck Converter
A buck converter is also called a step-down converter. Its principle of operation is illustrated by referring to
Figure 9.18(a). The IGBT acts as a high-frequency switch. The IGBT is repetitively closed for a time ton and
opened for a time toff. During ton, the supply terminals are connected to the load, and power ﬂows from supply
to the load. During toff, load current ﬂows through the freewheeling diode D1, and the load voltage is ideally
zero. The average output voltage is given by
Vout ¼ DVin
where D is the duty cycle of the switch and is given by D ¼ ton/T, where T is the time for one period. 1/T is the
switching frequency of the power device IGBT.
FIGURE 9.17

Boost Converter
A boost converter is also called a step-up converter. Its principle of operation is illustrated by referring to
Figure 9.18(b). This converter is used to produce higher voltage at the load than the supply voltage. When the
power switch is on, the inductor is connected to the dc source and the energy from the supply is stored in it.
When the device is off, the inductor current is forced to ﬂow through the diode and the load. The induced
voltage across the inductor is negative. The inductor adds to the source voltage to force the inductor current
into the load. The output voltage is given by
Vout ¼ Vin
1  D
Thus for variation of D in the range 0 , D , 1, the load voltage Vout will vary in the range Vin , Vout , 1.
Buck–Boost Converter
A buck–boost converter can be obtained by the cascade connection of the buck and the boost converter. The
steady-state output voltage Vout is given by
Vout ¼ Vin
D
1  D
This allows the output voltage to be higher or lower than the input voltage, based on the duty cycle D.
A typical buck–boost converter topology is shown in Figure 9.18(c). When the power device is turned on, the
FIGURE 9.18

Power Electronics

input provides energy to the inductor and the diode is reverse biased. When the device is turned off, the energy
stored in the inductor is transferred to the output. No energy is supplied by the input during this interval. In
dc power supplies, the output capacitor is assumed to be very large, which results in a constant output voltage.
In dc drive systems, the chopper is operated in step-down mode during motoring and in step-up mode during
regeneration operation.
Resonant-Link dc–dc Converters
The use of resonant converter topologies would help to reduce the switching losses in dc–dc converters and
enable the operation at switching frequencies in the megahertz range. By operating at high frequencies, the size
of the power supplies could be reduced. There are several types of resonant converter topologies. The most
popular conﬁguration is shown in Figure 9.19. The dc power is converted to high-frequency alternating power
using the MOSFET half-bridge inverter. The resonant capacitor voltage is transformer-coupled, rectiﬁed using
the two Schottky diodes, and then ﬁltered to get output dc voltage. The output voltage is regulated by control
of the inverter switching frequency.
Instead of parallel loading as in Figure 9.19, the resonant circuit can be series-loaded; that is, the
transformer in the output circuit can be placed in series with the tuned circuit. The series resonant circuit
provides the short-circuit limiting feature.
There are other forms of resonant converter topologies mentioned in the literature such as quasi-resonant
converters and multiresonant converters. These resonant converter topologies ﬁnd applications in high-
density power supplies.

Power Supplies
Ashoka K.S. Bhat
Introduction
Power supplies are used in many industrial and aerospace applications, and also in consumer products. Some
of the requirements of power supplies are small size, light weight, low cost, and high power conversion
efﬁciency. In addition to these, some power supplies require the following: electrical isolation between the
source and load, low harmonic distortion for the input and output waveforms, and high power factor (PF) if
the source is ac voltage. Some special power supplies require controlled direction of power ﬂow.
Basically two types of power supplies are required: ac and dc. The output of dc power supplies is regulated
or controllable dc, whereas the output for ac power supplies is ac. The input to these power supplies can be
ac or dc.
DC Power Supplies
If ac source is used, then ac-to-dc converters explained, in Section ‘‘Power Conversion’’, can be used. In these
converters, electrical isolation can only be provided by bulky line frequency transformers. The ac source can be
rectiﬁed with a diode rectiﬁer to get an uncontrolled dc, and then a dc-to-dc converter can be used to get a
controlled dc output. Electrical isolation between the input source and the output load can be provided in the dc-
to-dc converter using a high-frequency (HF) transformer. Such HF transformers have small size, light weight,
and low cost compared to bulky line frequency transformers. Whether the input source is dc (e.g., battery) or ac,
dc-to-dc converters form an important part of dc power supplies and they are explained in this subsection.
DC power supplies can be broadly classiﬁed as linear and switching power supplies.
A linear power supply is the oldest and simplest type. The output voltage is regulated by dropping the extra
input voltage across a series transistor (therefore also referred to as a series regulator). They have very small
output ripple, theoretically zero noise, large hold-up time (typically 1 to 2 msec), and fast response. Linear
power supplies have the following disadvantages: very low efﬁciency, electrical isolation can only be on 60 Hz
ac side, larger volume and weight, and in general, only a single output possible. However, they are still used in
very small regulated power supplies and in some special applications (e.g., magnet power supplies). Three-
terminal linear regulator integrated circuits (ICs) are readily available (e.g., mA7815 has þ15 V, 1 A output),
are easy to use, and have built-in load short-circuit protection.
Switching power supplies use power semiconductor switches in the on and off switching states, resulting in
high efﬁciency, small size, and light weight. With the availability of fast switching devices, HF magnetics and
capacitors, and high-speed control ICs, switching power supplies have become very popular. They can be
further classiﬁed as pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converters and resonant converters, and they are
explained below.
9-17
Power Electronics

Pulse-Width-Modulated Converters
These converters employ square-wave pulse-width modulation to achieve voltage regulation. The average
output voltage is varied by varying the duty cycle of the power semiconductor switch. The voltage waveform
across the switch and at the output are square-wave in nature (refer to Figure 9.14(b)), and they generally
result in higher switching losses when the switching frequency is increased. Also, the switching stresses are
high with the generation of large electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is difﬁcult to ﬁlter. However, these
converters are easy to control, well understood, and have a wide load control range.
The methods of control of PWM converters are discussed next.
The Methods of Control. The PWM converters operate with a ﬁxed frequency, variable duty cycle. Depending
on the duty cycle, they can operate in either continuous current mode (CCM) or discontinuous current mode
(DCM). If the current through the output inductor never reaches zero (refer to Figure 9.14) then the converter
operates in CCM; otherwise DCM occurs.
The three possible control methods [1–5] are brieﬂy explained below.
1. Direct duty cycle control is the simplest control method. A ﬁxed frequency ramp is compared with the
control voltage (Figure 9.20(a)) to obtain a variable duty cycle base drive signal for the transistor. This is the
simplest method of control. Disadvantages with this method are: (a) no voltage feedforward provision to
anticipate the effects of input voltage changes, slow response to sudden input changes, poor audio
susceptibility, poor open-loop line regulation, higher loop gain required to achieve speciﬁcations; and
(b) poor dynamic response.
2. Voltage feedforward control. In this case the ramp amplitude varies in direct proportion to the input
voltage (Figure 9.20(b)). The open-loop regulation is very good, and the problems in 1(a) above are corrected.
3. Current mode control. In this method, a second inner control loop compares the peak inductor current
with the control voltage which provides improved open-loop line regulation (Figure 9.20(c)). All of the
problems of the direct duty cycle control method 1 above are corrected with this method. An additional
advantage of this method is that a two-pole second-order ﬁlter is reduced to a single-pole (the ﬁlter capacitor)
ﬁrst-order ﬁlter, resulting in simpler compensation networks.
The above control methods can be used in all the PWM converter conﬁgurations explained below.
PWM converters can be classiﬁed as: (1) single-ended and (2) double-ended converters. These converters
may or may not have a high-frequency transformer for isolation.
Nonisolated Single-Ended PWM Converters
The basic nonisolated single-ended converters are: (a) buck (step-down), (b) boost (step-up), (c) buck–
boost (step up or down, also referred to as ﬂyback), and (d) Cuk converters (Figure 9.21). The ﬁrst three
of these converters were discussed in Section ‘‘Power Conversion’’. The Cuk converter provides the
advantage of nonpulsating input–output current ripple requiring smaller size external ﬁlters. Output
voltage expression is the same as the buck–boost converter (refer to Section ‘‘Power Conversion’’) and can
be less than or greater than the input voltage. There are many variations of the above basic nonisolated
converters and most of them use high-frequency transformers for ohmic isolation between the input and
the output. Some of them are discussed below.
Isolated Single-Ended Topologies
1. The ﬂyback converter (Figure 9.22) is an isolated version of the buck–boost converter. In this converter
(Figure 9.22), when the transistor is on, energy is stored in the coupled inductor (not a transformer) and
this energy is transferred to the load when the switch is off.
Some of the advantages of this converter are that the leakage inductance is in series with the output
diode when current is delivered to the output and, therefore, no ﬁlter inductor is required; cross-
regulation for multiple output converters is good; it is ideally suited for high-voltage output applications;
and it has the lowest cost.
Some of the disadvantages are that large output ﬁlter capacitors are required to smooth the pulsating
output current; inductor size is large since air-gaps are to be provided; and due to stability reasons,

ﬂyback converters are usually operated in the
DCM, which results in increased losses. To avoid
the
stability
problem,
ﬂyback
converters
are
operated with current mode control explained
earlier. Flyback converters are used in the power
range of 20 to 200 W.
2. The forward converter (Figure 9.23) is based on the
buck converter. It is usually operated in the CCM to

currents

have the stability problem of the ﬂyback converter.

Power Electronics

The HF transformer transfers energy directly to the output with very small stored energy. The output
capacitor size and peak current rating are smaller than they are for the ﬂyback. Reset winding is required
to remove the stored energy in the transformer. Maximum duty cycle is about 0.45 and limits the control
range. This topology is used for power levels up to about 1 kW.

3. The ﬂyback and forward converters explained above
require the rating of power transistors to be much
higher than the supply voltage. Two transistor
ﬂyback and forward converters shown in Figure
9.24 limit the voltage rating of transistors to the
supply voltage.
4. The Sepic converter shown in Figure 9.25 is another
isolated single-ended PWM converter.
Double-Ended PWM Converters
Usually, for power levels above 300 W, double-ended converters are used. In double-ended converters,
full-wave rectiﬁers are used and the output voltage ripple will have twice the switching frequency. Three
important double-ended PWM converter conﬁgurations are push–pull (Figure 9.26), half-bridge (Figure 9.27),
and full-bridge (Figure 9.28).
1. The push–pull converter. The duty ratio of each transistor in a push–pull converter (Figure 9.26) is less
than 0.5. Two of the advantages are that the transformer ﬂux swings fully, and thereby the size of the
transformer is much smaller (typically half the size) than single-ended converters, and output ripple is
twice the switching frequency of transistors, therefore needing smaller ﬁlters.
Some of the disadvantages of this conﬁguration are that the transistors must block twice the supply
voltage, ﬂux symmetry imbalance can cause transformer saturation with special control circuitry required
to avoid this problem, and use of a center-tap transformer requires extra copper resulting in a higher
volt–ampere (VA) rating.
Current mode control (for the primary current) can be used to overcome the ﬂux imbalance.
This conﬁguration is used in the 100 to 500 W output range.
2. The half-bridge. In the half-bridge conﬁguration (Figure 9.27) a center-tapped dc source is created by two
smoothing capacitors (Cin), and this conﬁguration utilizes the transformer core efﬁciently. The voltage
across each transistor is equal to the supply voltage (half of push–pull) and, therefore, suitable for high-
voltage inputs. One salient feature of this conﬁguration is that the input ﬁlter capacitors can be used to
change between 110 and 220 V mains as selectable inputs to the supply.
The disadvantage of this conﬁguration is the requirement for large-size input ﬁlter capacitors.
The half-bridge conﬁguration is used for power levels on the order of 500 to 1000 W.
3. The full-bridge. The full-bridge conﬁguration (Figure 9.28) requires only one smoothing capacitor, and
for the same transistor type as that of half-bridge, output power can be doubled. It is usually used for
power levels above 1 kW and the design is more costly due to the increased number of components (four
transistors compared to two in push–pull and half-bridge converters).

Power Electronics

One of the salient features of a full-bridge converter is that, using proper control technique, it can be
operated in zero-voltage switching (ZVS) mode [19,22], which results in negligible switching losses.
However, at reduced load currents, the ZVS property is lost. Recently, there has been a lot of effort made
to overcome this problem (for example Refs. [20,21]).

Resonant Power Supplies
Similar to the PWM converters, there are two types of resonant converters: single-ended and double-ended.
Resonant converter conﬁgurations are obtained from the PWM conﬁgurations explained earlier by adding
inductor-capacitor (LC) resonating elements to obtain sinusoidally varying voltage and/or current waveforms.
This approach reduces the switching losses and the switch stresses during switching instants, enabling the
converter to operate at high switching frequencies, resulting in reduced size, weight, and cost. Some other
advantages of resonant converters are that leakage inductances of HF transformers and the junction
capacitances of semiconductors can be used proﬁtably in the resonant circuit, reducing EMI. The major
disadvantage of resonant converters is increased peak current (or voltage) stress. To overcome this problem,
resonant transition converter conﬁgurations have been proposed [14–18,20,21].
Single-Ended Resonant Converters
They are referred to as quasi-resonant converters (QRCs) since the voltage (or current) waveforms are quasi-
sinusoidal in nature. The QRCs can operate with zero-current switching (ZCS) or ZVS, or both. All the QRC
conﬁgurations can be generated by replacing the conventional switches by the resonant switches shown in
Figure 9.29 and Figure 9.30. A number of conﬁgurations are realizable. Basic principles of ZCS and ZVS are
explained brieﬂy below.
1. Zero-current switching QRCs [7,8]. Figure 9.31(a) shows an example of a ZCS QR buck converter
implemented using a ZC resonant switch. Depending on whether the resonant switch is a half-wave or full-
wave type, the resonating current will be only half-wave sinusoidal (Figure 9.31(b)) or a full sine-wave
FIGURE 9.28
Full-bridge converter.

Power Electronics

(Figure 9.31(c)). The device currents are shaped sinusoidally and, therefore, the switching losses are almost
negligible with low turn-on and turn-off stresses. ZCS QRCs can operate at frequencies on the order of
2 MHz. The major problems with this type of converter are high peak currents through the switch and
capacitive turn-on losses.
2. Zero-voltage switching QRCs [7,9]. ZVS QRCs are duals of ZCS QRCs. The auxiliary LC elements are used
to shape the switching device’s voltage waveform at off time in order to create a zero-voltage condition
for the device to turn on. Figure 9.32(a) shows an example of ZVS QR boost converter implemented
using a ZV resonant switch. The circuit can operate in the half-wave (Figure 9.32(b)) or full-wave mode
(Figure 9.32(c)) depending on whether a half-wave or full-wave ZV resonant switch is used, and the name
comes from the capacitor voltage waveform. The full-wave mode ZVS circuit suffers from capacitive turn-
on losses. The ZVS QRCs suffer from increased voltage stress on the switch. However, they can be
operated at much higher frequencies compared to ZCS QRCs.

Double-Ended Resonant Converters [7,10–13].
These converters use full-wave rectiﬁers at the output, and they are generally referred to as resonant
converters. A number of resonant converter conﬁgurations are realizable by using different resonant tank
circuits, and the three most popular conﬁgurations—the series resonant converter (SRC), the parallel
resonant converter (PRC), and the series-parallel resonant converter (SPRC) (also called the LCC-type
PRC)—are shown in Figure 9.33. Recently, the LCL-type resonant converter [13] has also become popular.
Series resonant converters (Figure 9.33(a)) have high efﬁciency from full load to part load. Transformer
saturation is avoided due to the series blocking resonating capacitor. The major problems with the SRC are
that it requires a very wide change in switching frequency to regulate the load voltage and the output ﬁlter
capacitor must carry high ripple current (a major problem, especially in low-output voltage, high-output
current applications).
Parallel resonant converters (Figure 9.33(b)) are suitable for low-output voltage, high-output current
applications due to the use of ﬁlter inductance at the output with low ripple current requirements for the ﬁlter
capacitor. The major disadvantage of the PRC is that the device currents do not decrease with the load current,
resulting in reduced efﬁciency at reduced load currents.
The SPRC (Figure 9.33(c)) takes the desirable features of SRC and PRC.
Load voltage regulation in resonant converters for input supply variations and load changes is achieved by
either varying the switching frequency or using ﬁxed-frequency (variable pulse-width) control.
1. Variable-frequency operation. Depending on whether the switching frequency is below or above the natural
resonance frequency (or), the converter can operate in different operating modes as explained below.
a. Below-resonance (leading PF) mode. When the switching frequency is below the natural resonance
frequency, the converter operates in below resonance mode (Figure 9.34). The equivalent impedance
across AB presents a leading PF so that natural turn-off of the switches is assured and any type of fast
turn-off switch (including asymmetric SCRs) can be used. Depending on the instant of turn-on of
switches S1 and S2, the converter can enter two modes of operation: continuous and discontinuous
current modes. The steady-state operation in CCM (Figure 9.34(a)) is explained brieﬂy as follows.

Power Electronics

Assume that diode D2 was conducting and switch S1 is turned on. The current carried by D2 will be
transferred to S1 almost instantaneously (except for a small time of recovery of D2 during which input
supply is shorted through D2 and S1, and the current is limited by the di/dt limiting inductors). The
current i then oscillates sinusoidally and goes to zero in the natural way. The current tries to reverse, and
the path for this current is provided by the diode D1. Conduction of D1 feeds the reactive energy in the
load and the tank circuit back to the supply. The on-state of D1 also provides a reverse voltage across S1,

snubbers are required. For operation above resonance, only capacitive snubbers are required as shown.) (a) Series resonant

allowing it to turn off. After providing a time equal to or greater than the turn-off time of S1, switch S2
can be turned on to initiate the second half cycle. The process is similar to the ﬁrst half cycle, with the
voltage across vAB being of opposite polarity, and the functions of D1, S1 will be assumed by D2, S2.
With this type of operation, the converter works in the continuous current mode as the switches are
turned on before the currents in the diodes reach zero. If the switching on of S1 and S2 is delayed such
that the currents through the previously conducting diodes reach zero, then there are zero current
intervals and the inverter operates in the DCM (Figure 9.34(b)).
Load voltage regulation is achieved by decreasing the switching frequency below the rated value. Since
the inverter output current i leads the inverter output voltage nAB, this type of operation is also called a
leading PF mode of operation. If transistors are used as the switching devices, then for operation in DCM,
the pulse width can be kept constant while decreasing the switching frequency to avoid CCM operation.
DCMoperation has the advantages of negligible switching losses due to ZCS, lower di/dt and dv/dt stresses,
and simple control circuitry. However, DCM operation results in higher switch peak currents.
From the waveforms shown in Figure 9.34, the following problems can be identiﬁed for operation in
the below-resonance mode: requirement of di/dt inductors to limit the large turn-on switch currents,
and a need for lossy RC-snubbers and fast recovery diodes. Since the switching frequency is decreased to
control the load power, the HF transformer and magnetics must be designed for the lowest switching
frequency, resulting in increased size of the converter.

current mode and (b) discontinuous current mode.

Power Electronics

b. Above-resonance (lagging PF) mode. If switches capable of gate or base turn-off (e.g., MOSFETs, bipolar
transistors) are used, then the converter can operate in the above-resonance mode (lagging PF mode).
Figure 9.35 shows some typical operating waveforms for such type of operation, and it can be noticed that
the current i lags the voltage nAB. Since the switch takes current from its own diode across it at zero-
current point, there is no need for di/dt limiting inductance, and a simple capacitive snubber can be used.
In addition, the internal diodes of MOSFETs can be used due to the large turn-off time available for the
diodes. Major problems with lagging PF mode of operation are that there are switch turn-off losses, and
since the voltage regulation is achieved by increasing the switching frequency above the rated value, the
magnetic losses increase and the design of a control circuit is difﬁcult.
Exact analysis of resonant converters is complex due to the nonlinear loading on the resonant tanks. The
rectiﬁer-ﬁlter-load resistor block can be replaced by a square-wave voltage source (for SRC; Figure 9.33(a))
or a square-wave current source (for PRC and SPRC; Figure 9.33(b) and (c)). Using fundamental
components of the waveforms, an approximate analysis [10,11] using a phasor circuit gives a reasonably
good design approach. This analysis approach is illustrated next for the SPRC.

The plot of converter gain versus the switching frequency ratio ys, obtained using Equation 9.1 is shown for

frequency change. Lower values of Cs/Ct take the characteristics of a PRC. Therefore, a compromised value
of Cs/Ct ¼ 1 is chosen.
It is possible to realize higher-order resonant converters with improved characteristics and many of
them are presented in [10,13].
3. Fixed-frequency operation. In order to overcome some of the problems associated with the variable
frequency control of resonant converters, they are operated with ﬁxed frequency [7,12,13]. A number of
conﬁgurations and control methods for ﬁxed-frequency operation are available in the literature
(Refs. [12,13] give a list of papers). One of the most popular methods of control is the phase-shift
control (also called clamped-mode or PWM operation) method. Figure 9.38 illustrates the clamped-
mode ﬁxed-frequency operation of the SPRC. The load power control is achieved by changing the
phase-shift angle f between the gating signals to vary the pulse width of nAB.

4. Design example. Design a 500 W output SPRC (half-bridge version) with secondary-side resonance
(operation in lagging PF mode and variable-frequency control) with the following speciﬁcations:
minimum input supply voltage ¼ 2Emin230
230 V
load voltage; Vo ¼ 48 V
switching frequency; fs ¼ 100 kHz
maximum load current ¼ 10:42 A
As explained in item 2, Cs/Ct ¼ 1 is chosen. Using the constrains: (1) minimum kVA rating of tank
circuit per kW output power, (2) minimum inverter output peak current, and (3) enough turn-off time
for the switches, it can be shown [10] that Qs ¼ 4 and ys ¼ 1.1 satisfy the design constraints. From
Figure 9.37, M ¼ 0.8 p.u.
Average load voltage referred to primary-side of the HF transformer ¼ 0.8 · 115 V ¼ 92 V. Therefore,
the transformer turns ratio required > 1.84:
R0
L ¼ n2ðV2
o=PoÞ ¼ 15:6 ohms
The values of Ls and Cs can be obtained by solving
ðLs=CsÞ1=2 ¼ 4 · 15:6 O
and
or ¼ 1=ðLsCsÞ1=2 ¼ 2p · fs=ys
Solving the above equations gives Ls ¼ 109 mH and Cs ¼ 0.0281 mF. Leakage inductance (Lp þLs
0) of the HF
transformercan be used as part of Ls. Typical value for a 100 kHz practical transformer (using Tokin Mn–Zn
2500B2 Ferrite, E–I type core) for this application is about 5 mH. Therefore, the external resonant
inductance required is L ¼ 104 mH.
Since Cs/Ct ¼ 1 is chosen, Ct ¼ 0.0281 mF. The actual value of Ct used on the secondary side of the
HF transformer ¼ (1.84)2 · 0.0281 ¼ 0.09514 mF. The resonating capacitors must be HF type (e.g.,
polypropylene) and must be capable of withstanding the voltage and current ratings obtained above
(enough safety margin must be provided).
Using Equation (9.9) and Equation (9.11) through Equation (9.13):
peak current through switches ¼ 7:6 A
peak voltage across Cs; Vcsp ¼ 430 V
peak voltage (on secondary side) across C0
t; Vctp ¼ 76 V
peak current through the capacitor C0
t (on secondary side); Ictp ¼ 4:54 A
A simple control circuit can be built using PWM IC SG3525 and TSC429 MOSFET driver ICs.
Resonant Transition Converters
There are two types of resonant transition converters, namely, zero-current transition (ZCT) [14] and zero-
voltage transition (ZVT) [15–17] converters. These converters are realized from their PWM counterparts
using LC resonant elements together with one (or more) auxiliary switch. The resonance circuit is activated
using an auxiliary switch for a short duration either during turn-off transition (for ZCT) to achieve ZCS or
during turn-on transition (for ZVT) to achieve ZVS. This family of converters operates in a similar way to
PWM converters (square-wave voltage or current), retaining their advantages, while the main switch turns-off
9-32
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

with zero-current in ZCT converter and turns-on with zero-voltage in ZVT converters. This concept can be
used for single-ended [14–19] and double-ended converters [19–22].
With the development of digital ICs operating on low voltage (on the order of 3 V) supplies, the use of
MOSFETs as synchronous rectiﬁers with very low voltage drop (,0.2 V) has become essential [4] to increase the
efﬁciency of the power supply.
AC Power Supplies
Some applications of ac power supplies are ac motor drives, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) used as a
standby ac source for critical loads (e.g., in hospitals, computers), and dc source-to-utility interface (either to
meet peak power demands or to augment energy by connecting unconventional energy sources like
photovoltaic arrays to the utility line). In ac induction motor drives, the ac main is rectiﬁed and ﬁltered to
obtain a smooth dc source, and then an inverter (single-phase version is shown in Figure 9.39) is used to
obtain a variable-frequency, variable-voltage ac source. The sinusoidal pulse-width modulation technique
described in Section ‘‘Power Conversion’’ can be used to obtain a sinusoidal output voltage. Some other
methods used to get sinusoidal voltage output are [6] a number of phase-shifted inverter outputs summed in
an output transformer to get a stepped waveform which approximates a sine wave, and the use of a bang-bang
controller shown in Figure 9.39. All these methods use line-frequency (60 Hz) transformers for voltage
translation and isolation purposes. To reduce the size, weight, and cost of such systems, one can use dc-to-dc
converters (discussed earlier) as an intermediate stage. Figure 9.40 shows such a system in block schematic
form. One can use an HF inverter circuit (discussed earlier) followed by a cycloconverter stage. The major

output can be obtained using the modulation in the output inverter stage or in the dc-to-dc converter.

Power Electronics

problem with these schemes is the reduction in efﬁciency due to the extra power stage. Figure 9.41 shows a
typical UPS scheme. The battery shown has to be charged by a separate rectiﬁer circuit.
ac-to-ac conversion can also be achieved using cycloconverters (e.g., Ref. [6]).
Special Power Supplies [6]
Using the inverters and cycloconverters, it is possible to realize bidirectional ac and dc power supplies. In these
power supplies [6], power can ﬂow in both directions, i.e., from input to output or from output to input. It is
also possible to control the ac-to-dc converters to obtain sinusoidal line current with unity PF and low
harmonic distortion at the ac source.

Converter Control of Machines
Bimal K. Bose
Converter-controlled electrical machine drives are very important in modern industrial applications. Some
examples in the high-power range are metal rolling mills, cement mills, and gas line compressors. In the
medium-power range are textile mills, paper mills, and subway car propulsion. Machine tools and computer
peripherals are examples of converter-controlled electrical machine drive applications in the low-power range.
The converter normally provides a variable-voltage dc power source for a dc motor drive and a variable-
frequency, variable-voltage ac power source for an ac motor drive. The drive system efﬁciency is high because
the converter operates in switching mode using power semiconductor devices. The primary control variable
of the machine may be torque, speed, or position, or the converter can operate as a solid-state starter of the
machine. The recent evolution of high-frequency power semiconductor devices and high-density and
economical microelectronic chips, coupled with converter and control technology developments, is providing
a tremendous boost in the applications of drives.
Converter Control of dc Machines
The speed of a dc motor can be controlled by controlling the dc voltage across its armature terminals. A phase-
controlled thyristor converter can provide this dc voltage source. For a low-power drive, a single-phase bridge
converter can be used, whereas for a high-power drive, a three-phase bridge circuit is preferred. The machine
can be a permanent magnet or wound ﬁeld type. The wound ﬁeld type permits variation and reversal of ﬁeld
and is normally preferred in large power machines.
Phase-Controlled Converter dc Drive
Figure 9.42 shows a dc drive using a three-phase thyristor bridge converter. The converter rectiﬁes line ac voltage
to variable dc output voltage by controlling the ﬁring angle of the thyristors. With rated ﬁeld excitation, as the
armature voltage is increased, the machine will develop speed in the forward direction until the rated, or base,
speed is developed at full voltage when the ﬁring angle is zero. The motor speed can be increased further by
weakening the ﬁeld excitation. Below the base speed, the machine is said to operate in constant torque region,
whereas the ﬁeld weakening mode is deﬁned as the constant power region. At any operating speed, the ﬁeld can be
reversed and the converter ﬁring angle can be controlled beyond 90– for regenerative braking mode operation
of the drive. In this mode, the motor acts as a generator (with negative induced voltage) and the converter acts as
an inverter so that the mechanical energy stored in the inertia is converted to electrical energy and pumped back
to the source. Such two-quadrant operation gives improved efﬁciency if the drive accelerates and decelerates
frequently. The speed of the machine can be controlled with precision by a feedback loop where the command
9-35
Power Electronics

speed is compared with the machine speed measured by a tachometer. The speed loop error generally generates
the armature current command through a compensator. The current is then feedback controlled with the ﬁring
angle control in the inner loop. Since torque is proportional to armature current (with ﬁxed ﬁeld), a current loop
provides direct torque control, and the drive can accelerate or decelerate with the rated torque. A second bridge
converter can be connected in antiparallel so that the dual converter can control the machine speed in all the four
quadrants (motoring and regeneration in forward and reverse speeds).
Pulsewidth Modulation Converter dc Machine Drive
Four-quadrant speed control of a dc drive is also possible using an H-bridge pulsewidth modulation (PWM)
converter as shown in Figure 9.43. Such drives (using a permanent magnet dc motor) are popular in low-
power applications, such as robotic and instrumentation drives. The dc source can be a battery or may be
obtained from ac supply through a diode rectiﬁer and ﬁlter. With PWM operation, the drive response is very
fast and the armature current ripple is small, giving less harmonic heating and torque pulsation. Four-
quadrant operation can be summarized as follows:
Quadrant 1: Forward motoring (buck or step-down converter mode)
Q1—on
Q3, Q4—off
Q2—chopping
Current freewheeling through D3 and Q1
Quadrant 2: Forward regeneration (boost or step-up converter mode)
Q1, Q2, Q3—off
Q4—chopping
Current freewheeling through D1 and D2
Quadrant 3: Reverse motoring (buck converter mode)
Q3—on
Q1, Q2—off

Quadrant 4: Reverse regeneration (boost converter mode)

Q2—chopping
Current freewheeling through D3 and D4
Often a drive may need only a one- or two-quadrant mode of operation. In such a case, the converter topology
can be simple. For example, in one-quadrant drive, only Q2 chopping and D3 freewheeling devices are
required, and the terminal A is connected to the supply positive. Similarly, a two-quadrant drive will need only
one leg of the bridge, where the upper device can be controlled for motoring mode and the lower device can be
controlled for regeneration mode.
Converter Control of ac Machines
Although application of dc drives is quite common, disadvantages are that the machines are bulky and
expensive, and the commutators and brushes require frequent maintenance. In fact, commutator sparking
prevents machine application in an unclean environment, at high speed, and at high elevation. ac machines,
particularly the cage-type induction motor, are favorable when compared with all the features of dc machines.
Although converter system, control, and signal processing of ac drives is deﬁnitely complex, the evolution of ac
drive technology in the past two decades has permitted more economical and higher performance ac drives.
Consequently, ac drives are ﬁnding expanding applications, pushing dc drives toward obsolescence.
Voltage-Fed Inverter Induction Motor Drive
A simple and popular converter system for speed control of an induction motor is shown in Figure 9.44. The
front-end diode rectiﬁer converts 60 Hz ac to dc, which is then ﬁltered to remove the ripple. The dc voltage is
then converted to variable-frequency, variable-voltage output for the machine through a PWM bridge inverter.
Among a number of PWM techniques, the sinusoidal PWM is common, and it is illustrated in Figure 9.45 for
one phase only. The stator sinusoidal reference phase voltage signal is compared with a high-frequency carrier
wave, and the comparator logic output controls switching of the upper and lower transistors in a phase leg.
The phase voltage wave shown refers to the ﬁctitious center tap of the ﬁlter capacitor. With the PWM
technique, the fundamental voltage and frequency can be easily varied. The stator voltage wave contains high-
frequency ripple, which is easily ﬁltered by the machine leakage inductance. The voltage-to-frequency ratio is
kept constant to provide constant airgap ﬂux in the machine. The machine voltage-frequency relation, and the
corresponding torque, stator current, and slip, are shown in Figure 9.46. Up to the base or rated frequency ob,
the machine can develop constant torque. Then, the ﬁeld ﬂux weakens as the frequency is increased at
FIGURE 9.44

Power Electronics

constant voltage. The speed of the machine can be controlled in a simple open-loop manner by controlling the
frequency and maintaining the proportionality between the voltage and frequency. During acceleration,
machine-developed torque should be limited so that the inverter current rating is not exceeded. By controlling
the frequency, the operation can be extended in the ﬁeld weakening region. If the supply frequency is
controlled to be lower than the machine speed (equivalent frequency), the motor will act as a generator and
the inverter will act as a rectiﬁer, and energy from the motor will be pumped back to the dc link. The dynamic
brake shown is nothing but a buck converter with resistive load that dissipates excess power to maintain the dc

Sinusoidal pulse width modulation principle.

bus voltage constant. When the motor speed is reduced to zero, the phase sequence of the inverter can be
reversed for speed reversal. Therefore, the machine speed can be easily controlled in all four quadrants.
Current-Fed Inverter Induction Motor Drive
The speed of a machine can be controlled by a current-fed inverter as shown in Figure 9.47. The front-end
thyristor rectiﬁer generates a variable dc current source in the dc link inductor. The dc current is then
converted to six-step machine current wave through the inverter. The basic mode of operation of the inverter
is the same as that of the rectiﬁer, except that it is force-commutated, that is, the capacitors and series diodes
help commutation of the thyristors. One advantage of the drive is that regenerative braking is easy because the
rectiﬁer and inverter can reverse their operation modes. Six-step machine current, however, causes large
harmonic heating and torque pulsation, which may be quite harmful at low-speed operation. Another disad-
vantage is that the converter system cannot be controlled in open loop like a voltage-fed inverter.
Current-Fed PWM Inverter Induction Motor Drive
The force-commutated thyristor inverter in Figure 9.47 can be replaced by a self-commutating gate turn-off
(GTO) thyristor PWM inverter as shown in Figure 9.48. The output capacitor bank shown has two functions:
(1) it permits PWM switching of the GTO by diverting the load inductive current, and (2) it acts as a low-pass
ﬁlter causing sinusoidal machine current. The second function improves machine efﬁciency and attenuates the
irritating magnetic noise. Note that the fundamental machine current is controlled by the front-end rectiﬁer,
and the ﬁxed PWM pattern is for controlling the harmonics only. The GTO is to be the reverse-blocking type.
Such drives are popular in the multimegawatt power range. For lower power, an insulated gate bipolar
transistor (IGBT) or transistor can be used with a series diode.
Cycloconverter Induction Motor Drive
A phase-controlled cycloconverter can be used for speed control of an ac machine (induction or synchronous
type). Figure 9.49 shows a drive using a three-pulse half-wave or 18-thyristor cycloconverter. Each output
phase group consists of positive and negative converter components which permit bidirectional current ﬂow.
The ﬁring angle of each converter is sinusoidally modulated to generate the variable-frequency, variable-
voltage output required for ac machine drive. Speed reversal and regenerative mode operation are easy.

The cycloconverter can be operated in blocking or circulating current mode. In blocking mode, the positive or
negative converter is enabled, depending on the polarity of the load current. In circulating current mode, the
converter components are always enabled to permit circulating current through them. The circulating current
reactor between the positive and negative converter prevents short circuits due to ripple voltage. The
circulating current mode gives simple control and a higher range of output frequency with lower harmonic
distortion.
Slip Power Recovery Drive of Induction Motor
In a cage-type induction motor, the rotor current at slip frequency reacting with the airgap ﬂux develops the
torque. The corresponding slip power is dissipated in the rotor resistance. In a wound rotor induction motor,
the slip power can be controlled to control the torque and speed of a machine. Figure 9.50 shows a popular slip
power-controlled drive, known as a static Kramer drive. The slip power is rectiﬁed to dc with a diode rectiﬁer
and is then pumped back to an ac line through a thyristor phase-controlled inverter. The method permits
speed control in the subsynchronous speed range. It can be shown that the developed machine torque is
proportional to the dc link current Id and the voltage Vd varies directly with speed deviation from the

synchronous speed. The current Id is controlled by the ﬁring angle of the inverter. Since Vd and VI voltages
balance at steady state, at synchronous speed the voltage Vd is zero and the ﬁring angle is 90–. The ﬁring angle
increases as the speed falls, and at 50% synchronous speed the ﬁring angle is near 180–. This is practically the
lowest speed in static Kramer drive. The transformer steps down the inverter input voltage to get a 180– ﬁring
angle at lowest speed. The advantage of this drive is that the converter rating is low compared with the
machine rating. Disadvantages are that the line power factor is low and the machine is expensive. For limited
speed range applications, this drive has been popular.
Wound Field Synchronous Motor Drive
The speed of a wound ﬁeld synchronous machine can be controlled by a current-fed converter scheme as
shown in Figure 9.47, except that the forced-commutation elements can be removed. The machine is operated
at leading power factor by overexcitation so that the inverter can be load commutated. Because of the
simplicity of converter topology and control, such a drive is popular in the multimegawatt range.
Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive
Permanent magnet (PM) machine drives are quite popular in the low-power range. A PM machine can have
sinusoidal or concentrated winding, giving the corresponding sinusoidal or trapezoidal induced stator voltage
wave. Figure 9.51 shows the speed control system using a trapezoidal machine, and Figure 9.52 explains the
wave forms. The power MOSFET inverter supplies variable-frequency, variable-magnitude six-step current
wave to the stator. The inverter is self-controlled, that is, the ﬁring pulses are generated by the machine
position sensor through a decoder. It can be shown that such a drive has the features of dc drive and is
normally deﬁned as brushless dc drive. The speed control loop generates the dc current command, which is
then controlled by the hysteresis-band method to construct the six-step phase current waves in correct
phase relation with the induced voltage waves as shown in Figure 9.52. The drive can easily operate in
four-quadrant mode.

Introduction
Photoconductive Devices
Semiconductor electronic devices operate by the controlled motion of charge carriers inside them. One has to
induce some nonequilibrium in the charge carrier density to operate a semiconductor device. This can be done
either by external electric ﬁeld (electrical injection), optical pulse (optical injection), or by thermal energy
(thermionic emission). Photoconductive devices fall within a special class of electronic devices where the
transport or the initiation of transport of these charge carriers is done by optical energy.
Photoconductive devices operate on the principle of photogeneration. The phenomenon is shown in
Figure 9.53, where an electron is transported from the valence band to the conduction band by the incidence
of a photon. The photon energy (hn), where n is the frequency of the light and h is the Planck’s constant, must
be greater than the bandgap energy (Eg) of the semiconductor, for photogeneration to occur. Transport of one
electron from valence band to conduction band also implies the generation of a hole in the valence band. So
photogeneration always occurs in electron–hole (E–H) pairs. These E–H pairs take part in current conduction
in the device and because they are generated by light incidence, we call the device a photoconductive device.
Why Photoconductive Devices in Power Electronics?
Advancement in power electronics (PE) has always been dependent upon the advance in power semiconductor
switches [1]. Starting from the early days of p-n-junction rectiﬁer and power BJTs, and cruising through
power MOSFET, thyristor, gate turn-off thyristor (GTO), we have now reached the age of advance devices like
merged p-i-n/Schottky (MPS) rectiﬁer or nonpunch-through insulated gate bipolar transistor (NPT-IGBT).
They are all electrically operated, i.e., the control signal to open or close the switch in a power electronics
system is electrical. This can be either the base drive current for a power BJT or the gate drive voltage for
a power MOSFET or an IGBT. Photoconductive or optically triggered devices (OTD), when used in PE
9-43
Power Electronics

systems, have the potential to signiﬁcantly increase the switching frequencies for all power levels and eliminate
some of the major problems of electrically-triggered devices (ETD). In an ETD, the gate of the power device is
ﬁred electrically; while the triggering action in an OTD is provided by the photo-generation of E–H pairs,
which may be direct band-to-band transition or between the band and the deep levels in the energy gap
depending directly upon the energy of the photonic source [2]. Because of this unique characteristic, OTDs
provide jitter-free operations, fast opening and closing times, high repetition rates, and fast recovery times, all
of which enable high frequency of operation without sacriﬁcing switching efﬁciency. In addition, OTDs are
scalable for handling low, medium, and high power, and have low storage effects and inductance, which are
useful for monolithic integration.
Advantages: Device Physics Point of View
Demand for ever-increasing switching frequency in power electronics has placed stress not only on the external
control system, but also on the design of the semiconductor switches. The switches must be physically large to
handle power, but at the same time, their large size places limitations on the ability to rapidly control the
switch, especially during controlled turn-off. The physical ability to remove the charge, stored in the junctions
of bipolar devices, becomes, in particular, a serious limitation as device size is increased. The alternative is to
parallel devices in multi-chip modules, which has limitations both technically and economically. Since highly
efﬁcient devices are still mostly built from bipolar conﬁgurations (such as BJTs, GTOs, and IGBTs), this
represents a fundamental limitation: High power or high switching frequency? In other words, today’s power
electronics systems can be either high power or high power density, but it is difﬁcult to have both
simultaneously.
The basic problem is scaling the device dimensions, which presents two fundamental physical problems:
. Limitations imposed by multi-dimensional ﬁeld distributions
. Limitations imposed by multi-dimensional charge transport
With respect to the second limitation, the problem is how to inject or extract charge from large volumes to
realize conventional gate control. The conventional approach is to create structures with large surface-area-to-
volume ratios (or large perimeter-length-to-area ratios). A high-power gate-turn-off (GTO) thyristor with a
convoluted gate structure is a common example. The trench structure used in power ﬁeld-effect transistors
(FET) is another. The basic problem is one of the boundary conditions. ‘‘Spreading out’’ the current allows a
power device to be scaled for higher current ratings without exceeding the safe current density limit of the
material. At some point, however, boundaries must intrude to permit gate or base control and to collect charge
ﬂowing to or from the external circuit. Nonuniform current density distributions eventually arise as the
switching speed increases. This may be transient, but the effects can still be inconvenient or even catastrophic.

Current ﬁlamentation, thermal runaway, second breakdown, and snap back are all manifestations of the
inﬂuence of this multi-dimensional charge transport in power semiconductor devices at the limits of switching
speed.
Optical control of power semiconductor devices is an important technical approach for pushing these
fundamental limits up. The optical injection of either minority or majority carriers over large areas is
straightforward. For example, a device base or gate region can be irradiated with photons possessing at least
the bandgap energy to inject E–H pairs in thin regions where charge injection initiates conduction. Absorption
of photons with subbandgap energy (through trap-assisted optical excitation) also makes it possible to
optically inject carriers into large volumes, such as the drift region. Both processes fundamentally eliminate the
delay and the nonuniform current density distributions associated with the electrical transport of charge
carriers to the gate or base control regions of large power devices.
However, there is another reason to consider optically activated power switches. The optical stimulation
of deep trap levels can also remove mobile charge from the conduction and valence bands, thus providing
a method for optically controlling switching a power semiconductor on and off. The physical mechanism
of infrared quenching of photoconductivity has long been known, and will be discussed in the context of
the bistable optically stimulated switch (BOSS) in the next section. Infrared quenching has been
successfully applied to provide a purely optical control technique for command turn-on and turn-off of
power switches [3].
Advantages: Circuit Point of View
On a circuit level, the simple difference between optically and electrically triggered systems results in some key
additional advantages for the former, that are especially signiﬁcant at high switching frequencies.
First, in an OTD there is complete electrical isolation between the gate driver and the power stage. As such,
very high di/dt and dv/dt, which cause signiﬁcant reliability problems in an ETD at a high switch frequency,
have no impact on an OTD. Therefore, the basic architecture of the gate driver in an OTD is simple.
Second, for two- and higher-level electrically triggered switching converters, different designs of low- and
high-side drivers are required; the latter is especially difﬁcult to design for medium- and high-power
applications. For an optically triggered converter, the designs of high- and low-side drivers remain the same.
Third, for ﬁring OTDs (as opposed to that for ETDs), optically multiplexed triggering signals (as often
encountered in modern optical ﬁber-based control systems) do not need to be converted back to electrical
signals. This leads to simplicity of overall design, enhanced controlled bandwidth, enhanced reliability of the
system, and monolithic integration.
Fourth, as the switching frequency of an ETD increases, parasitic oscillations may be induced in the driver
circuit owing to coupling effects between the device capacitance and the parasitic inductance of the gate
connection and also due to transmission-line effects. This may lead to failure of the gate driver; with an OTD
such possibilities do not arise.
Fifth, an OTD based converter does not suffer from gate-driver failure due to short circuiting.
Clearly, photoconductive or optically triggered devices have the potential to address these problems faced
with conventional ETDs. They are emerging devices for power electronic applications and much research is
going on in this topic. In the next sections, some of the state-of-the-art photoconductive devices will be
discussed along with their operational features.
Principal Photoconductive Devices in Power Electronics
All of the photoconductive devices work on the principle of photogeneration of excess carriers which disturbs
the equilibrium of charge carriers inside semiconductor and results in current conduction; but some are
particularly suitable for power electronic applications, which demand speciﬁc attributes from a semiconductor
switch such as high reverse voltage blocking capability, large current density handling capacity, low on-state
voltage drop, low opening and closing delays, and precise controllability. Good thermal stability, low contact
and surface defect densities, and radiation hardness are additional requirements for higher reliability and for

extreme applications (military or space applications). We discuss the important photoconductive devices and
their respective pros and cons as a power semiconductor switch.
Photoconductive Switch
One of the main uses of optical control could be enabling a different scaling law for the design of high
blocking-voltage power devices. The depletion region charge distribution fundamentally limits the
blocking voltage in conventional devices. And, even then the fundamental limit is seldom achieved
because surfaces and curvature in the doped regions produce electric ﬁeld magnitudes in excess of the
critical value at reduced voltage. The width W of the triangular ﬁeld distribution in the one-dimensional
solution to the Poisson equation describing the uniformly doped depletion region in a pþ-n-junction is
given by:

where es is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, q is the elementary charge, ND is the net doping
concentration in the controlling (lightly doped) portion of the depletion region, and Ec is the critical electric
ﬁeld of the semiconductor. In simplifying Equation (9.15) we neglect the built-in potential Vbi , 1 V. Solving
for the maximum blocking voltage VB of the junction we obtain:
VB ¼ 1

This well-known result demonstrates that in a conventional power device the maximum blocking voltage is
limited by the net doping of the depletion region. Practical limits on both ND and the drift region thickness W
limits blocking voltages to the order of 10 kV in silicon.
A conceptually different approach uses a neutral semiconductor with very low equilibrium conductivity s
between two ohmic contacts to block larger voltages. This approach, the heart of the photoconductive switch
(PCS), which is discussed in the next section, typically uses a semiinsulating (SI) semiconductor such as
gallium arsenide. SI GaAs is routinely grown with s , 108/Ocm. Recently, SI-silicon carbide (SiC) has
become commercially available with more than 1000 times lower conductivity.
Provided that the diffusion length of the majority carriers is much less than the thickness of the SI region W,
the blocking voltage can be estimated using Ohm’s law
VB ¼ J
s W
ð9:17Þ
where J is the ohmic current density. To the extent that ohmic current–voltage characteristics (zeroth-order
dimensional physics) apply, then VB can be increased independently of doping simply by increasing W. Until
instabilities, associated with multidimensional charge transport, intrude the only theoretical limits on VB are that
of VB/W , Ec and that J2/s does not exceed safe operating thermal limits. Under laboratory conditions, single
PCSs, based on highly resistive silicon, have demonstrated VB . 100 kV [1]. The problem of making such a highly
resistive switch turn on is resolved by the optical injection of photoconductors that drift across the SI material.
There are two operating modes of PCSs that have been researched rather extensively. The ﬁrst is the
optically triggered PCS and the second is the optically sustained PCS. The device structure is typically the same
(two ohmic contacts separated by a highly resistive semiconductor). The separate operating modes arise from
the use of photoconductive gain g deﬁned as
g ¼ tL
td
ð9:18Þ
9-46
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

where tL is the carrier lifetime and td is the average time required by a carrier to drift across the photoconductive
switch. If g . 1 then the PCS can be optically triggered; if g , 1 then the PCS must be optically sustained. PCSs
with large photoconductive gain (g .. 1) are used as efﬁcient closing switches, because they can be triggered on
with a short pulse of light after which they remain in conduction for durations of the order of tL. Regenerative
conduction is supplied by the carrier injection from the ohmic contacts (as opposed to across a junction as in a
thyristor). Since the PCS is intended for power applications, a relatively large gap between the electrodes is
required, so that tL must be exceptionally long (0.1 to 1 msec) to observe large photoconductive gain. Bipolar
conduction is possible in materials with inefﬁcient direct recombination such as silicon, which is an indirect
bandgap semiconductor available in high purity so that trap-assisted recombination is minimized.
Semiconductors with efﬁcient E–H recombination such as gallium arsenide can also exhibit large
photoconductive gain via unipolar conduction. Here, a trap is introduced into the bandgap that efﬁciently
traps only one of the carrier types (e.g., holes). The opposite carrier type becomes the majority carrier (e.g.,
electrons) provided that the majority carrier lifetime satisﬁes g . 1. This approach has long been used in CdS
photocells. An example of this type of photoconductor applied to a power switch is copper-doped GaAs, which
will be treated in greater detail next.
There are advantages and disadvantages of the optically triggered PCS in power electronics. One
advantage is the voltage scalability of a PCS by increasing the linear dimension; thus, a single PCS can be
made to handle much larger voltages than a typical conventional power switch (i.e., thyristor or IGBT).
Another advantage is that the regenerative conduction mechanism is not easily triggered by electrical means,
making an optically triggered PCS virtually immune to spurious dv/dt triggering in conventional power
electronics applications. Indeed, the dielectric strength of the PCS usually increases under transient voltages
(i.e., with increasing dv/dt) [4]. The combination of fewer switches and optical triggering can simplify the
design of a multi-valve converter. The main disadvantage is that it is difﬁcult to design the switch for a
useful blocking voltage and an acceptable conduction loss while achieving an acceptable average power from
the triggering light source. One result is that there are no widely accepted, commercially available PCSs for
power electronics applications.
Optically sustained PCSs (g , 1) terminate the current pulse automatically with the removal of the
sustaining light source (which is usually a laser pulse). These naturally opening switches interrupt current
over a time scale given by tL. Hard switching of approximately 50 kV and 500 A with an impressive
di/dt ¼ 25 kA/msec and dv/dt ¼ 2500 kV/msec has been demonstrated with a single gold-doped Si PCS [5].
However, for power electronics applications the laser energy required to sustain conduction against such an
efﬁcient free carrier loss mechanism is prohibitive. These devices appear limited to highly specialized pulsed
power applications.
Bistable Optical Switch (BOSS)
There is another attractive physical mechanism available in optically activated power switches. The optical
stimulation of deep trap levels can also remove mobile charge from the conduction and valence bands, thus
providing a method for optically controlling the conduction state of power semiconductor switches both on
and off. The observation of infrared quenching of photoconductivity in copper-doped GaAs was ﬁrst reported
in [6]. Infrared quenching in copper-doped semiinsulating GaAs has been applied to the PCS concept to
produce the bistable optically stimulated switch (BOSS) [7]. BOSS is triggered on to produce majority carrier
conduction with large photo-conductive gain by laser photons with wavelength of the order of 1 mm. Majority
carrier lifetimes, signiﬁcantly greater than 1 msec, have been stimulated by nanosecond laser pulses [8].
Termination of the current pulse can be triggered at any time during the conduction period by stimulating
infrared quenching with laser photons with wavelength about twice that required for turn on (i.e., l ¼ 2 mm).
This process does not redirect the current ﬂow, but instead interrupts it by optically stimulating fast free
carrier recombination. Hard switching at 4.5 kV and 50 A (di/dt ¼ 650 A/msec and dv/dt ¼ 38 kV/msec) has
been reported [9]. Less than 10 nsec rise and fall times and conduction periods greater than 1 msec are possible
with inexpensive GaAs. The conduction time can be arbitrarily extended by applying multiple l ¼ 1 mm
9-47
Power Electronics

conduction-stimulating laser pulses prior to a single l ¼ 2 mm conduction-extinguishing laser pulse. Special
preparation of the GaAs has produced subnanosecond turn-off [10].
The BOSS, fabricated as a conventional PCS, shares the advantages and disadvantages of the optically
triggered (closing) PCS described above without suffering, to the same degree, the inefﬁciency of the optically
sustained (naturally opening) PCS. However, the need for two laser wavelengths increases complexity and cost,
and the problem of designing an efﬁcient cost-effective PCS for power electronics applications remains. One
solution could be to include the optically active material that forms BOSS in the control region of a
conventional power semiconductor switch, such as the base of an optically controlled BJTor the channel of an
optically controlled MOSFET.
Light-Triggered Thyristor (LTT)/Optothyristor
A thyristor is a four-layer (p–n–p–n), regenerative, bistable semiconductor switch. It is used mostly for high-
voltage dc (HVDC) transmission systems. Because of the very high voltage ratings of power thyristors and the
stacking of tens of thyristors in each valve in the converter circuit (this is needed for very high current density),
decoupling of the control circuit and the device itself is a very good option [4]. A light-triggered thyristor
could be the most elegant device for many applications. In addition, an electrically triggered thyristor (ETT)
valve requires many thyristor level electronic parts. An LTT valve eliminates most of these parts, resulting in
higher reliability and more compact system design. Furthermore, a triggering signal is sent to the LTT in the
form of light energy. This gives the LTT valve much better noise immunity than a conventional ETT valve,
which suffers from electromagnetic noise problems.
Light triggering of the thyristors is achieved by localized illumination at a centered site of the device. There
is an optical well and surrounding it there is a pilot thyristor and an amplifying thyristor structure.
Photogenerated E–H pairs cause a lateral current ﬂow from the center of the well, driven by the anode bias.
This lateral current induces a voltage drop (,0.7 V) in the main cathode junction, which is sufﬁcient to turn
on the pilot thyristor. The pilot thyristor then turns on the larger amplifying thyristor. This, in turn, is able to
drive the gate arms of the main device. The well is very sensitive and normally few mJ of optical energy is
sufﬁcient for taking the device into full conduction from a reverse blocking state. Sometimes, there can be
more than one amplifying gate depending upon the current requirement of the device. Figure 9.54 shows a
schematic of an LTT, with an optical gate, three amplifying gates, and an integrated breakover-cum-
photodiode (BOD). This diode is for overvoltage protection and it turns on the thyristor by avalanche current
if the reverse voltage exceeds the thyristor’s safe limit.
Optothyristors are normally made of III–V compounds, e.g., GaAs, AlGaAs, InP, because of their higher
temperature, radiation, and breakdown voltage handling capability compared to silicon. The direct bandgap
nature of these materials allows optical efﬁciency to be higher and also facilitates the exploration of
heterostructures [11].

Alhough successful fabrication and application of optothyristors have been demonstrated for high voltage,
pulsed power systems [12–14], surface degradation, edge breakdown, and deep-level effects of the
semiinsulating base layer can lead to early breakdown at a voltage much less than the theoretical value [12].
Like most power thyristors, LTTs are not suitable for fast switching (e.g., dv/dt . 2 kV/msec). As a result, the
principal application of these devices remains the high-voltage utility power market, where the required
switching speed is modest.
Another interesting approach has been reported in Ref. [15] to integrate the optical control detection
circuitry with power device and to create a LTT with a MOS amplifying gate structure. Figure 9.55 shows the
cross-section schematic of the device which integrates a MOS-gated thyristor, a photodiode, and a breakover
zener diode.
Optically Triggered Static Induction Transistor
The static induction transistor (SIT) is a unipolar, vertical channel ﬁeld-controlled semiconductor device [16].
The basic device structure is shown in Figure 9.56. It exhibits intrinsic turn-on and turn-off capability, and
may be triggered electrically as well as optically. Some high-power systems, such as solid-state laser driver
modules and microwave traveling tube ampliﬁers require high switching speeds (10 to 200 nsec) and high
switched voltages (10 to 20 kV). This can only be achieved by series-coupled ﬁeld-effect devices. Designing gate
driver circuitry for MOSFETs poses problems due to high voltage ﬂoating potentials. Optically modulated
series-coupled SITs are excellent choice because the ground-referenced low-power optical trigger sources are
isolated from the high-voltage switch assembly through optical ﬁbers, and they result in reliable, jitter-free
operation [17]. Optically triggered SITs are also made from III–V materials to beneﬁt from the advantage of
high critical electric ﬁeld and higher carrier mobility of these elements.
A transparent gate structure is used for optical absorption. Photogenerated electrons transit across the
channel and are collected at the drain, whereas photogenerated holes drift to the gate junction. Based upon
simple one-dimensional calculation, the relationship between the forward blocking voltage (VB), the
saturation (maximum) value of the device’s blocking gain (GM), and the optical parameters has been
shown [17] to be

Optically Triggered MOSFET and IGBT
Sustained growth of power electronics will depend, among other factors, on the ability to develop power
systems with higher power densities [18,19]. A widely accepted and viable approach for enhancing the power
density is to increase the switching frequency of a power processor/system, because that lowers the values of
parasitic components, i.e., capacitors and inductors, which takes up almost double the space of the power
stage in a full-ﬂedged system.
Among the power semiconductor devices, MOSFET is the preferred choice for high-frequency
applications due to its unipolar conduction, which does not introduce any minority carrier storage delay,
as in the case of a power BJT or thyristor. Also it has good dv/dt and di/dt handling capability and a
negative thermal resistance coefﬁcient, which makes paralleling of multiple devices much easier than in the
case of a BJT or thyristor, by eliminating the chance of thermal runway. For moderate voltage and current
levels (,600 V and ,20 to 30 A continuous current), MOSFET is the device of choice in the
frequency range of .50 kHz. Applications include motor drives, switch-mode power supplies, solid-state
ballasts, etc.
Interestingly, the optical switching of power MOSFETs has been rarely studied. Optical control of
MOSFET or M–I–S (metal–insulator–semiconductor) structure, in general, has been reported [20,21], but

primarily in the domain of low power optical communication or sensor applications. Recently, simulation
studies on the modulation techniques for an optically controlled power MOSFET (OT-MOS) have been
reported [22]. A vertical double-diffused MOS (DMOS) is controlled by a turn-on and a turn-off pulse and
the hybrid device structure schematic, comprising an Si-based DMOS, a GaAs-based photodiode, and a
GaAs-based photoconductive switch (PCS), is shown in Figure 9.57. The photodiode acts as a
photogenerated current source, which, when exposed to the turn-on pulse, modulates the i-drift region
resistance, conducts current (supplied by the reverse bias source), and charges the gate capacitance of the
DMOS above the threshold voltage to turn on the OT-MOS. Again, during turn-off, another optical pulse
falls on the PCS to modulate its conductivity, providing a short-circuit path through the PCS, and
discharging the gate capacitance of the DMOS to turn it off. So the turn-on and -off time can be adjusted
either by manipulating the absolute values, i.e., amplitudes of the photogenerated current source strength
and PCS conductivity, or by varying the time-period of the triggering pulses, thus allowing the gate
capacitance of the OT-MOS to charge or discharge for a varying time.
Consequently, there are possibilities of using both amplitude and pulse-width modulation techniques for
triggering optical pulses. Figure 9.58 and Figure 9.59 show the switching result of the OT-MOS using these
techniques. The circuit used for these simulations is a hard-switching arrangement comprising a 50 V drain
voltage, 5 O external resistance, and 12 V photodiode reverse bias. Though only the modulation technique is
reported [22], further work continues and the OT-MOS has also been simulated for sustained switching
performance on a synchronous buck converter circuit. The results are shown in Figure 9.60(a) and (b), which
indicate that the performance of the OT-MOS matches that of an electrically triggered MOSFET of the same
voltage and current ratings, under identical circuit conditions. Analytical modeling and steady-state

characterizations have also been done to reveal an interesting result, that the OT-MOS triggering pulses should
have an optimized wavelength (or should lie within a small range of wavelengths) for fastest triggering of the
device with minimum optical energy, and also that increasing the optical beam energy or equivalently
decreasing the wavelength may actually lead to poor switching performance. The wavelength comparison

The insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a relatively new power device, introduced in the early 1980s.
It features higher current drive and voltage stand-off capability than MOSFET, but lower frequency of
operation due to a bipolar conduction mode and higher on-state voltage drop. However, its operating
frequency is much higher than that of the power BJT. Overall, it is the device of choice for relatively low
frequency, high current density and .600 V applications, such as motor control, uninterrupted power supply
(UPS), and welding equipment. A similar approach to trigger an IGBT with a direct optical pulse, incident in
its channel region (the approach is schematically shown in Figure 9.62a), has been reported in Ref. [23]. It
shows promising improvement in the on-state voltage drop of the optical IGBT because the channel width in
this case depends upon the absorption depth for the particular semiconductor material–optical wavelength
pair and it can be signiﬁcantly higher than the intrinsic Debye length (a few nanometers), which is the default
channel width for a MOSFET.

and voltage drop and does not report switching results for the optical IGBT, nevertheless this approach is
worth exploring and can lead to fully optically controlled IGBT based high-power converters.
Futher research on these types of devices has led to GaAs-AlGaAs based optically controllable lateral
switching power devices [24]. Optically gated bipolar transistor (OGBT) (structural schematic has been shown
in Figure 9.62b) features high device gain due to optically initiated base conductivity modulation.
Furthermore, due to shorter carrier lifetime in GaAs compared to silicon, OBGT can be switched faster than
conventional electrically triggered power bipolar transistors. Details of the structure and operation have been
explained in Ref. [24].
Other Optically Controlled Power Devices
Power diodes have been in use as rectiﬁers in power electronics from its earliest days. Optically-controlled Si-
and GaAs-based lateral and vertical p-i-n diodes have been reported [25,26]. Most of these devices are targeted
for low-frequency but high power (in the range of 100 kW) applications, e.g., pulsed-power switching or
microwave power generation. Figure 9.63 illustrates a simple p-i-n diode schematic with the incident optical
beam and photogeneration in the intrinsic region. Normally the diode is reverse-biased and conducts very
small dark current in its off-state. When the light falls on it through an optical window, excess carriers are
generated, the conductivity increases signiﬁcantly, and the diode conducts current as given by Equation (9.16).
An excellent treatment on the steady-state characteristics and device geometry for an optically controlled p-i-n
diode is given in Ref. [27].
The GaAs metal-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor (MESFET) is the basic building block of high-speed
monolithic microwave integrated circuits. Although MESFET itself is not an ideal switch for use in high-power
PE converters (due to its low current carrying capability), for radio-frequency (RF) power applications optical
control of MESFET can be a viable proposition. Figure 9.64 shows an illuminated MESFET structure. When
the device is illuminated with light of photon energy greater than the bandgap energy, the illuminated channel
region contributes optically generated gate photocurrent. Illuminated interelectrode epilayer photocurrent
modulates the conductivity of the epilayer. In the episubstrate barrier region excess photogenerated carriers
reduce the barrier height and the illuminated part of the substrate contributes to the substrate current.
A comprehensive model of the optical switching of a GaAs MESFET is given in [28]. It can be inferred from
the reported results that the MESFET is not a very fast optical switch and its rise and fall times lie in the range
of the submicrosecond region. Recently, numerical simulation studies on vertical optically triggered power
transistors (OTPT) have been reported in [29]. Vertical structure allows increased current carrying capability

maintaining fast optical control by direct photogeneration–recombination in the channel region of the device.
OTPT does not have a gate oxide structure, thus making it possible to use GaAs–AlGaAs material system for
fabrication (because in general, III-V compound semiconductors pose problems in growing high-quality
insulator to realize MOSFET structures), which results in fast switching times due to lower carrier lifetime of
GaAs compared to silicone.
Research Issues
Power-electronic converters need not only high switching frequencies but also high efﬁciencies. Thus, an
optical switch must have fast opening and recovery (to achieve high repetition rates) and high switch-transfer
efﬁciency. Conventionally, the applications of optical switching to ultra-low-power applications (such as high-
speed data transmission) have focused primarily on speed and not on efﬁciency because in such applications
speed is of the essence. However, some of the very high-power applications have primarily focused on
efﬁciency and not on speed. With high switching frequency, an additional difﬁculty arises because completely
opposite requirements exist between the conduction and transition (on- and off-phases) states of an optical
switch. During the conduction state, high carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime (for high conduction
efﬁciency) is highly desired; while during the on and off transition phases the switch must show a short carrier
lifetime for fast closing and opening actions, and high open-state impedance.
While lowering the dynamic losses of an optically switched power converter is necessary at high switching
frequencies, a reduction in conduction losses is equally important to increase efﬁciency. As such, an OTD
should also have low on-resistance and forward voltage drop. OTDs must also have good voltage-standoff
properties and the ability to minimize leakage current under dc voltage and long-pulse bias. The importance
of voltage standoff increases with the higher operating voltage of a converter. To reduce leakage current
under high biased conditions, which can lead to thermal runaway, an OTD should have very high
impedance after it opens.
Irrespective of the power level, most power-electronic systems need to either regulate or track reference
voltages and currents. This is achieved, in general, by controlling the power switches using constant or
variable frequency pulse-width modulation, pulse-amplitude modulation, or other related modulation
strategies under closed-loop (or open-loop) feedback operation. The success of each of these modulation
strategies relies on the ability of the OTD to follow feedback control pulses accurately; the delay between the
optical illumination and the onset of the switching should be minimal. Furthermore, the OTD for power-
electronic applications must be jitter-free, have controllable conduction times, and a large dynamic range
of operation.
Device life of an OTD is another important consideration for power-conversion systems. The power supply
companies want operational life to be several million operations. However, most optical switches to date fail to
hold off the voltage for that long. In addition, there are a number of possible effects that could cause device
FIGURE 9.64

Power Electronics

failure [11]. These include metal migration from the contacts, defects in the material synthesis, nonuniform
(ﬁlamentary) current ﬂow, and thermal effects. Additionally, to enhance the life of an OTD at high switching
frequencies, adequate power dissipation is of concern, since experience has shown that the second most
common source of failure after electrical breakdown is thermal. Hence, an OTD with superior thermal stability
(that is, better thermal capacity and conductivity) is necessary. Another factor of prime importance is the
temperature coefﬁcient of the OTDs. For example, it has been shown [11] that optical switches comprised of
materials with negative temperature coefﬁcients when subjected to dc voltages are often susceptible to thermal
runaway; needless to say, a signiﬁcant number of power-electronic systems are powered by dc electrical
sources.
A promising approach is to add true optical control to existing device topologies. One possibility is to
incorporate the optically active materials used in the BOSS to form an optically controlled BJT or MOSFET
hybrid. In particular this approach could eliminate the main two disadvantages of the PCS approach when
applied as a controlled opening switch; namely the prohibitively high amount of light energy required to
control the photoconductivity and scaling limits imposed by current instabilities observed during
reestablishment of large blocking voltages. At the same time, devices can be scaled in size without imposing
severe limits on switching speed caused by the problem of electrically removing stored charge in gate and base
regions. Candidates for new, optically controlled conventional power devices include copper-doped GaAs and
boron-doped SiC, incorporation of which is limited to the gate region of the FET or the base region of a BJT.
The drift regions, relying on majority carrier injection from the much smaller optically controlled regions of
the device, remain the same. The resulting hybrid device reduces the optically controlled volume by orders of
magnitude compared to that of a conventional PCS, with a corresponding increase in control gain (given by
the electrical-to-optical power ratio).

Nonlinear Control of Interactive Power-Electronics Systems
Sudip K. Mazumder
Introduction
Interactive power-electronics systems (IPNs), such as parallel dc–dc or parallel muniphase converters, are
nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems [1,2]. The instability in such switching systems, owing to their
discontinuity, can evolve on slow and fast scales. Conventional analyses of IPNs and their subsystems are based
on averaged models, which ignore fast-scale instability and analyze the stability on a reduced-order manifold.
As such, the validity of the averaged models varies with the switching frequency, even for the same topological
structure. The prevalent procedure for analyzing the stability of IPNs and their subsystems is based on
linearized averaged (small-signal) models that require a smooth averaged model. Yet there are systems (in
active use) that yield a nonsmooth averaged model [2]. Even for systems for which a smooth averaged model
is realizable, small-signal analyses of the nominal solution/orbit do not provide anything about three
important characteristics [1–3]: region of attraction of the nominal solution, dependence of the converter
dynamics on the initial conditions of the states, and the postinstability dynamics. As such, conventional linear
controllers for IPNs, designed based on small-signal analyses, may be conservative and may not be robust and
optimal. Clearly, there is a need to design nonlinear controllers for such hybrid systems, thereby achieving a wider
stability margin, improved robustness against parametric variations, feedforward and feedback disturbances,
switching nonlinearities, interactions, and enhanced performance.
Applications
Parallel dc–dc converter
Parallel dc–dc converters, as shown in Figure 9.65 are widely used in telecommunication power supplies
[4–16]. They operate under closed-loop feedback control to regulate the bus voltage and enable load sharing
[1, 4–16]. These closed-loop converters are inherently nonlinear systems. The major sources of nonlinearities
are switching nonlinearity and interaction among the converter modules.1 Yet, most conventional controllers
for parallel dc–dc converters are linear. Recently, there have been many studies of the nonlinear control of
standalone dc–dc converters [17–26], which have focused on variable-structure controllers (VSC) [27,28],
Lyapunov-based controllers [29–33], feedback linearized and nonlinear H1 controllers [34–39], and fuzzy
logic controllers [40–42]. However, there are few studies on the nonlinear control of parallel dc–dc converters
where, unlike standalone converters, there is a strong interaction among the converter modules apart from the
feedforward and feedback disturbances.
In Ref. [43], a fuzzy-logic compensator is proposed for the master–slave control of a parallel dc–dc converter.
The controller uses a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) expert to derive the fuzzy inference rules; it shows
improved robustness as compared to linear controllers. However, the control design is purely heuristic and the
stability of the overall system has not been proven. In Reference [44], a VSC has been developed for a buck
converter using interleaving. However, the interleaving scheme works only for three parallel modules. Besides,
this paper gives no details regarding the existence and stability of the sliding manifolds.
In Ref. [45], Mazumder et al. have developed integral-variable-structure control (IVSC) schemes for N
parallel dc–dc buck converters. The choice of a VSC is logical for power converters because the control and
plant are both discontinuous. All of the nonlinear controllers mentioned earlier [21–26], which are not based
on VSC, have completely relied on the smooth averaged models of the power converters. Therefore, control is
valid only on a reduced-order manifold. The IVSC retains all of the properties of a VSC; that is, simplicity in
1The uniform distribution of power ﬂow among the parallel connected converter modules is important for reasons of cost
effectiveness and long-term reliability. Parallel modules are not identical because of ﬁnite tolerances in power stage and control
parameters. As a result, the load current is not equally distributed among the modules, leading to excessive component stresses.
Modules delivering higher currents will have a shorter lifetime and system reliability is degraded. Therefore, the control scheme
should ensure equal distribution of power among the parallel connected converters.

design, good dynamic response, and robustness. In addition, the integral action of the IVSC eliminates the
bus-voltage error and the error between the load currents of the converter modules under steady-state
conditions. It also reduces the impact of very high-frequency dynamics due to parasitics on the closed-loop
system.
Finally, when the error trajectories are inside the boundary layer1 by modifying the control using the
concepts of multiple-sliding-surface control (MSSC) [46,47] or the block-control principle [48,49], we are
able to reject mismatched disturbances [50–53] and keep the steady-state switching frequency constant. This is
achieved by calculating the duty ratio for each buck converter, as shown in Figure 9.66, ‘‘from a global
stability’’ point of view (using Lyapunov’s method). The error signals ensure that the output bus is regulated at
a predetermined voltage reference while the load-sharing among the N modules is maintained under transient
and steady-state conditions. The fundamental difference in computing the duty ratio for the nonlinear
controller and that for a conventional linear controller yields superior transient performance of the buck
converter without compromising its steady-state performance [45]. This is because inside the boundary layer,
using the duty ratio, one can implement PWM control as well as interleaving [45].

The results of an application of the nonlinear controller, for a four-phase voltage-regulated module (VRM)
for next-generation Intel processor, are shown in Figure 9.67 to Figure 9.69. The power-stage architecture of
the VRM is the same as that shown in Figure 9.65. The VRM transient and steady-state speciﬁcations, which
are ‘‘extremely stringent,’’ are described in Table 9.1. Figure 9.67 shows the output voltage and the inductor
currents in the four modules of the VRM, under steady-state conditions. The four inductor currents are
interleaved, i.e., they differ in phase by 90–, which yields an output-ripple frequency four times that of the
module switching frequency, thereby reducing the size of the output capacitor. The interleaving is also
conﬁrmed by the four equally-phase-shifted low-side gate-driver signals, as shown in Figure 9.68. Additionally,
the VRM steady-state performance satisﬁes the stringent 2% tolerance. Finally, the transient performance of
the VRM using the nonlinear controller is shown in Figure 9.69. The slew rate of the load transient is
50 A/msec. The results show that, even though the slew rate of the load transient is extremely fast, the
nonlinear controller satisﬁes the VRM speciﬁcations in Table 9.1 during both no-load to full-load as well as
vice versa conditions.
Parallel Multiphase Converter
Applications of parallel multiphase power converters are on the rise [54–65], because they provide several
advantages, including capability to handle high power, modularity, high reliability, less voltage or current
ripple, and fast-dynamic response. Traditionally, a parallel multiphase converter either has a transformer at the
ac side [57–59] or uses separate power supplies [56]. This approach, however, results in a bulky and expensive
system because of the line-frequency transformer and the additional power supplies.
A recent approach to overcome these problems is to directly connect three-phase converters in parallel; one
such system is shown in Figure 9.70. The parameters of the parallel three-phase boost rectiﬁer (PTBR) are
tabulated in Table 9.2. When two three-phase PWM modules are directly connected, circulating currents can
exist in all of the phases [60,64,65], as shown in Figure 9.71(a) and (b). Several methods have been proposed
to reduce the cross-current among the modules. Using a linear controller and space-vector modulation (SVM)
schemes, which do not use the zero vectors, Xing et al. [60] have developed schemes for standardized
FIGURE 9.68

three-phase modules to reduce the cross-current. The advantage of such schemes is that the communication
between the modules is minimal. However, the transient response of the PTBR is not satisfactory and the
magnitude of the zero-sequence current under steady-state conditions is not shown. Recently, Ye et al. [63]
have proposed a linear control scheme,1 which is simple and minimizes the zero-sequence current under
steady-state conditions by simply varying the duration of the zero space-vector. The steady-state performance
of the PTBR using CSLINEAR is shown in Figure 9.71(c). However, if the system saturates, the control scheme
will not work effectively, even under steady-state conditions. This is because, when the system saturates, the
zero vector cannot be applied. Furthermore, the performance of the system under transient conditions has not
been demonstrated [63].
Recently, three nonlinear control schemes were proposed by the author [64,65] to improve the transient
performances of the PTBR as compared to those obtained using CSLINEAR. The ﬁrst two control schemes

(CSCONT1 and CSCONT2) are developed in the continuous domain, whereas the third scheme (CSDISCRETE) is
developed in the discrete domain. The former control schemes stabilize the errors on the dq-axis sliding surfaces
and rely on blocking the pure zero-sequence current path, the inductor size, and the switching frequency to bind
the errors on the zero-axis sliding surfaces. The steady-state ripple of the PTBR obtained using CSCONT2 is slightly
better than that obtained using CSCONT1, because the former uses a hysteretic comparator, which has an inner and
an outer hysteretic band. The steady-state ripple of the PTBR obtained with CSDISCRETE is better than that
obtained with the other two proposed control schemes because the former combines SVM and nonlinear control,
and stabilizes the zero-axis disturbance as well. Hence, the steady-state ripple has a constant frequency, and the
deviation of the zero-axis current from its reference value (¼ 0) is minimized.
Figure 9.72 demonstrates the transient and steady-state performances of the PTBR using these three nonlinear
control schemes. We also compare the performances of the three proposed controllers with the linear controller
CSLINEAR. We ﬁnd that CSLINEAR stabilizers the circulating current. However, its transient response is inferior to
the proposed control schemes for even moderate feedforward and feedback disturbances. For even larger
disturbances, the transient performance of the controller proposed by Ye et al. [63] suffers considerably.
Next, using Figure 9.73, we investigate the sharing of the line currents between M1 and M2, when the
PTBR is subjected to a large disturbance in either the voltage (case 1) or the load (case 2). For case 1, we see
that the best transient response is achieved using CSCONT1; the response time is comparable to the other two
proposed schemes. The recovery time of the PTBR obtained with CSLINEAR is the longest. Moreover,

immediately after the change in the voltage, there is a undershoot and an overshoot in two of the phase
currents, which are not evident in the responses obtained with the proposed control schemes. For case 2,
among the three proposed control schemes, CSDISCRETE achieves the best compromise between the response
time and current sharing. The recovery times of CSCONT1 and CSCONT2 are smaller than that of CSDISCRETE.
The response of the PTBR obtained with CSLINEAR is signiﬁcantly inferior to those obtained with the
proposed control schemes, both in terms of the response time and current sharing.
Finally, in Figure 9.74, we show the impact of the proposed control schemes on the steady-state ripples of
the phase currents (in the ab frame) and on the zero-axis current that circulates between the two modules.
For all of these plots, we choose L1 ¼ 0.85Ln and L2 ¼ Ln. All other parameters are kept the same as before.

voltage, while case 2 corresponds to a large transient in the load. For either case, the drop in the bus voltage is larger when
using CSLINEAR, even though it is implemented for a smaller variation (5%) L1 as compared to the proposed control
schemes (15%).

The steady-state ripple obtained with CSDISCRETE is better than those obtained using CSCONT1 and CSCONT2.
More importantly, the zero-axis current obtained with CSDISCRETE has a smaller magnitude compared to the
previous cases. The steady-state results obtained using CSDISCRETE and CSLINEAR are close. Therefore, the
nonlinear controller CSDISCRETE attains the best compromise between the dynamic- and steady-state performances.

and CSLINEAR operate with L1 ¼ 85% Ln and L1 ¼ 95% Ln, respectively.

Research Issues
It is obvious from the above results that nonlinear controllers can and will play an increasingly effective
role for the stabilization and performance optimization of progressively complex IPNs. However, to
maximize the effectiveness of these nonlinear controllers, they need to be designed by treating an IPN
model as a hybrid system and not as a smooth averaged model. This is a major challenge because the
issues of existence of solutions and equilibrium stability for hybrids are difﬁcult propositions to resolve.
Additionally, to enhance the use of nonlinear controllers, their designs need to be systematic and not just
intuitive. A further issue to be resolved is the need and procedure to quantify the improvement in
performances of an IPN using a nonlinear controller with those that are obtained using a linear controller.
Finally, strategies for distributed nonlinear control of IPNs needs to be developed, which take into account
dynamic changes in the network and network processing delays leading to wider stability and power
optimization.

harmonic distortion and the zero-sequence current of CSDISCRETE and CSLINEAR are close.

Uninterruptible Power Supplies
Ayse E. Amac and Ali Emadi
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are presented in this section. Topologies, operation, and control
principles of UPS systems are explained in detail. In addition, a brief description of conventional UPS systems,
their disadvantages, scope for improvement, and advanced architectures in UPS research are presented.
Introduction
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are designed to provide reliable and high-quality continuous
power to critical loads in the face of events on the utility supply. These events can range from overvoltage and
undervoltage conditions to complete disruption of the mains. UPS systems ensure power without break for
the load as operating along with the mains as well as suppress line transients and harmonic disturbances.

UPS systems are being applied for a wide variety of critical equipment, such as medical facilities, life support
systems, ﬁnancial transaction handlers, data storage and computer systems, telecommunications, industrial
processing, and on-line management systems [1].
The objective of UPS systems is to provide sinusoidal input current with low total harmonic distortion
(THD) and to realize power line conditioning that has sinusoidal output voltage and unity power factor. In
addition, an ideal UPS should have seamless transition capability when a failure occurs, high reliability, and
high efﬁciency. Furthermore, the UPS system should be low maintenance, low cost, and lightweight [2].
UPS systems are reviewed here in terms of classiﬁcation, operation, and control. They are explained as
static, rotary, and hybrid static/rotary systems in the section ‘‘Classiﬁcation’’. Static UPS systems are deﬁned in
detail and in the section ‘‘Applications’’ distributed and centralized applications are presented. The section
‘‘Control Techniques’’ deals with suitable control techniques for these systems. Finally, the ‘‘Conclusion’’
summarizes the results obtained.
Classiﬁcation
When the critical loads need to be supplied without interruption, a UPS system is generally employed. Both
ﬁnancial and industrial sectors need clean and reliable power supplies. Therefore, the UPS market grows
increasingly and a wide range of UPS systems with various designs are now available in the market. There are
three types of UPS systems in the literature: static, rotary, and hybrid static/rotary systems. These three
categories are explained in this section.
Static UPS
Static UPS systems are available from 100 VA to 1 MVA. They are the most commonly used UPS systems from
low-power personal computers and telecommunication systems, to medium-power medical systems, to high-
power utility systems. They have high efﬁciency, high reliability, and low THD. Their main disadvantages are
poor performance with nonlinear and unbalanced loads and high cost for achieving very high reliability. The
main types of static UPS systems are off-line, on-line, and line-interactive topologies.
Off-Line UPS
Off-line topology is also called standby UPS or line-preferred UPS in the literature. These are widely used as
a backup system for various electrical loads. Off-line UPS consists of an ac/dc converter, a battery bank, a
dc/ac converter, and static and transfer switches as shown in Figure 9.75. There are three operating modes
for off-line UPS systems: normal mode of operation, recovery mode, and backup mode.
When the ac line is normal, the transfer and the static switches are on. The ac line supplies the load through
the switches. The dc/ac converter is connected in parallel to the load and stays on standby during the normal
mode of operation. Since it is traditionally off in this mode, an off-line UPS does not usually correct the power
factor. However, in the normal mode of operation, the dc/ac converter may be used as an active ﬁlter by

adding a simple control unit to the system. Therefore, reducing the line current harmonics and improving the
load power factor can be achieved by the off-line UPS system. In addition, the ac/dc converter can be adjusted
to decrease the harmonic content of the sinking current of the dc side. However, these improvements cause
increased cost and complexity [3,4].
If necessary, the ac line also feeds the ac/dc converter as well as the load to charge the battery. This mode is
called the recovery mode of operation. Since the ac/dc converter is used only as a charger, it does not need to
meet the power demand of the load. Therefore, it is rated at low power, which allows the off-line UPS systems
to be cheaper than the other static UPS topologies.
When the line is out of the preset tolerance, the transfer and static switches are off. This mode is known as
backup, emergency, or stored energy mode of operation. In order to prevent any power accident, the transfer
switch and the static switch disconnect the power between the line and the ac/dc converter and between the
line and the dc/ac converter, respectively. At the same time, the dc/ac converter is turned on. It has to meet the
power of the load. Until the line is within the preset tolerance again, the critical load is supplied by the battery
unit via the dc/ac converter. Transfer time is the most important issue in this mode. It is usually about a
quarter line cycle, which is enough for most of the applications such as personal computers.
Simple design, low cost, and small size are the main advantages of the off-line UPS topology. However, the
disadvantages of this topology are no output voltage regulation, long switching time, poor performance with
nonlinear loads, and lack of the real isolation of the load from the ac line. To overcome the isolation problem,
a three-winding transformer is employed in the system as shown in Figure 9.76. This technique has high
reliability at a moderate cost as well as limited power conditioning for the output voltage, but this transformer
leads to a heavier UPS with a lower efﬁciency.
As shown in Figure 9.77, a high-frequency transformer with a cycloconverter may be used at the output of
the inverter to achieve a compact and lightweight system. Moreover, acoustic noise is reduced in this
conﬁguration since the high-frequency transformer carries currents at frequencies close to the switching
frequency [5]. To improve the quality of the output voltage, a ﬁlter can be used at the output stage of the UPS
system. However these modiﬁcations increase the cost of off-line UPS systems. These limit off-line UPS system
applications to less than 2 kVA [6].
On-Line UPS
This conﬁguration is also known as double-conversion UPS and inverter-preferred UPS. On-line UPS consists
of an ac/dc converter (rectiﬁer/charger), a battery unit, a dc/ac converter (inverter), and static (bypass) and the

transfer switches as shown in Figure 9.78. There are four operating modes in the on-line UPS systems: normal
mode of operation, recovery mode of operation, stored energy mode of operation, and bypass mode of
operation.
When the ac line is normal, the transfer and bypass switches are on and off, respectively. The power
continuously ﬂows from the dc/ac converter through the ac/dc converter to the critical load. Contrary to the
off-line UPS topology, the dc/ac and ac/dc converters are always on in this mode of operation. Very good line
conditioning is obtained since double conversion takes place in this conﬁguration.
The ac/dc converter is used as a rectiﬁer and charger in this mode of operation. Therefore, it is rated at
100% of the power demanded by the load and battery unit. Since the dc/ac converter is always on, its power
rating is also required to meet 100% of the power demanded by the load. The dc/ac converter must supply the
load with the power delivered by the ac/dc converter. Therefore, both converters have the highest power rating
which causes high cost in this topology.

Power Electronics

When the ac line is out of the preset tolerance, the transfer switch is off to prevent any power accident
between the ac line and the load. This mode is called the backup mode of operation. The dc/ac converter
continues to deliver the power from the battery to the critical load without any interruption since it is always
on. When the ac input voltage is normal, the UPS system returns to the normal operating mode. A phase-
locked loop (PLL) is used to make the load voltage in phase with the input voltage.
In case of maintenance of the system or internal malfunction such as over current, the UPS operates in
bypass mode. In this mode of operation, the static and bypass switches are off and on, respectively.
Fault clearing is also done in this mode. The power is directly transferred through the bypass switch from
the ac input to the critical load. Therefore the output frequency should be the same as the ac line
frequency.
The main advantage of the on-line UPS system is no transition time from the normal mode to the
backup mode operation. This feature makes it more reliable than the off-line UPS topology. Moreover, the
output frequency can be regulated or changed ‘in this conﬁguration since the dc/ac converter is always on.
In addition, double-conversion allows very wide tolerance to the input voltage variations and very good
regulation of the output voltage. However, the on-line UPS topology has a low power factor, high THD at
the input, and low efﬁciency. These are the main disadvantages of the on-line UPS topology.
During the ac line outage, the ac/dc converter in the on-line UPS topology is disabled and kept idle.
Therefore, traditional on-line UPS topology is not good with nonlinear loads. The load current contains
harmonics and is not kept in phase with the output voltage. This causes a low power factor and low battery
utilization factor. As a result, the on-line UPS cannot effectively utilize the utility network and local
installation. Hence, power installations are oversized on distribution level and eventually the transmission
level. To overcome this problem an additional power factor correction (PFC) circuit can be used at the input as
shown in Figure 9.79. However, the cost of the UPS system increases with this improvement [7].
The on-line UPS is based on the topology of two power conversion stages. During the normal mode of
operation, the power ﬂows through the ac/dc converter and dc/ac converter from the input to the load.
Therefore, it has higher power losses and lower efﬁciency compared to other UPS topologies. However, in
terms of performance, power conditioning, and load protection, the on-line UPS system is the most
accomplished topology. They are produced with a very wide range of power ratings from a few kVA to
several MVA. This is the reason that on-line UPS have a large variety of topologies. Each topology aims to
work out different speciﬁc problems and the particular choice depends on the particular application.
However, generally, there are two major types of on-line UPS topologies: with bypass switch and without
bypass switch. The ﬁrst topology has a bypass switch or mechanism connected to it. In case of ac/dc converter
failure, the critical load will be directly supplied by the AC line through the switch. In the second topology, as
the bypass switch is removed, the UPS operates in the on-line mode. Redundancy is a considerable problem in
this conﬁguration. This conﬁguration can be realized with a low frequency transformer or a high frequency
transformer.
The block diagram of an on-line UPS with low frequency ac link is shown in Figure 9.80. This conﬁguration
has transformer isolation at the output which is at low frequency. The weight and volume of the UPS increase
since the transformer is heavy and bulky. Therefore, this topology is applicable only in high power ratings

which are larger than 20 kVA. The switching frequency is usually limited to less than 2 kHz. Because of low
switching frequency, the inductance of the output ﬁlter and the transformer produce high acoustic noise in the
system. A poor transient response to the load and input voltage changes is another disadvantage of this
topology. To solve these problems, the switching frequency of the dc/ac converter can be increased above 20
kHz. However, the size of the isolating transformer cannot be reduced since it is independent of the switching
frequency.
To reduce the size and weight of the transformer, a high-frequency ac link can be used in the on-line
UPS system as shown in Figure 9.81. This method also reduces the size of the output ﬁlter since a high
switching frequency is used. The disadvantage of this system is low efﬁciency because of the cascaded
converters.
Line-Interactive UPS
It is also called grid-interactive UPS system. There are three kinds of this UPS in the literature, called
line-interactive UPS: single-conversion, in-line, and double-conversion line-interactive UPS systems.
Single-Conversion Topology
The single-conversion topology was introduced in the 1990s. This topology is built on a single-converter
structure. The system consists of a static switch, a series inductor, a bidirectional converter, and a battery unit
as shown in Figure 9.82. A single-conversion topology can operate either as an on-line or off-line UPS [8]. The
series inductor is not required for the off-line operating mode. However, to provide a unity power factor or
regulate the output voltage, the single-conversion UPS is usually operated on-line.
When the system is normal, the load is directly supplied by the ac line. The bidirectional converter is in
parallel processing mode and charges the battery. It also provides reactive power for the nonlinear load to
obtain unity power factor or pure sinusoidal output voltage. The power conditioning function of the
bidirectional converter is used only in the single-conversion topology, which is worked as an on-line UPS. This
topology has two operating modes: normal mode and backup mode.
During the normal mode of operation, the power ﬂows from the ac line to the critical load through the
static transfer switch and the link inductor. The bidirectional converter acts as a parallel active power ﬁlter and

a current stabilizer. It maintains line current harmonics produced by the nonlinear load and forces the input
current to be sinusoidal with unity power factor. In addition, it produces a little active power to control dc bus
voltage and operates as a charger to feed the battery unit. Contrary to the conventional on-line UPS topology,
it does not cause additional harmonics at the input side. This is an important advantage of the single-
conversion line-interactive UPS topology.
When the utility is gone, the static switch is off to prevent back feed from the converter to the ac line. The
bidirectional converter acts as an inverter to supply the critical load with a seamless transition. The output
voltage can be better regulated with an additional transformer at the output. However, the UPS will be heavy,
bulky, and expensive.
The simple design, high reliability, and lower cost compared to the on-line UPS systems are the main
advantages of the single-conversion line-interactive UPS topologies. Since they are single-stage, the efﬁciency is
higher than that of the double-conversion topology. As was mentioned before, they also have good harmonic
control at the input.
There is no effective isolation between the load and the ac line in this topology. This is the main
disadvantage of the system. To overcome this problem, a transformer can be added at the output; however, it
will result in additional cost, size, and weight. Since it is not in series with the load, the output voltage cannot
be properly regulated. Moreover, the output frequency regulation is not possible in this topology because the
ac line directly supplies the load during the normal mode of operation [9].
In-Line Topology
This topology consists of a static switch, a triport high leakage inductance transformer, a bidirectional
converter, and a battery unit as shown in Figure 9.83. A voltage-source, voltage-controlled bidirectional
converter is used in this topology. It can be operated as a rectiﬁer or inverter. This topology is appropriate to
solve a wide range of power quality problems such as dip compensation, harmonic isolation, voltage
unbalance, power factor correction, voltage regulation, ﬂicker, and power outages [10].
When the ac line is normal, the load is supplied by the ac line through the static switch and the triport
transformer with leakage inductance. The bidirectional converter acts as a series active ﬁlter to regulate the
input voltage and keep the load voltage in a speciﬁc level. The magnitude of the bidirectional converter voltage
is kept constant by a suitable control signal. Therefore, it is protected from any sags, swells, and large
ﬂuctuations in the ac line voltage. The power factor correction is controlled through the power ﬂow of the
system. The bidirectional converter absorbs a lagging or leading VAR from the ac line to obtain pure sinusoidal
voltage for the load [11]. It also operates as a charger for charging to the battery unit in the normal mode of
operation.

When the ac line is out of the preset tolerance, the converter functions as a conventional inverter and
operates in the discharge mode. Since the transformer is employed in this topology, the isolation problem
between the utility and the load is solved compared to the single-conversion topology. Moreover, this
conﬁguration has high efﬁciency and low cost because of the single power stage. Increased dc bus voltage and
reduced harmonic content of the output voltage are also advantages of the in-line UPS conﬁguration [12]. The
topology is essentially stable and does not enforce any particular control restrictions.
The main disadvantage of the in-line UPS topology is its low power factor. Moreover, the output voltage of
the bidirectional converter is too low to be accepted in case of converter failure. Because of the high leakage
inductance of the triport transformer, low voltage problems can occur in this UPS topology [13].
Delta-Conversion Topology
This topology is also called a series-parallel compensated line-interactive UPS system. This conﬁguration can
provide the sinusoidal output voltage with low THD even for the nonlinear loads, during the normal or stored
energy modes of operation. It can also realize seamless transition from the charging to backup mode and vice
versa. At the same time, it can achieve low THD sinusoidal input current with unity power factor at the input
side of the system. It can complete these tasks independently of the load nonlinearities or power factor,
whereas conventional UPS topologies do not have these features [14].
The delta-conversion UPS topology consists of the auxiliary and the main bidirectional converters, a battery
unit, a static switch, and a transformer as shown in Figure 9.84. Two bidirectional converters coupled with a
common dc link are used to perform the series and parallel active ﬁltering functions as well as battery charging
and feeding the load during the power failures. The battery unit is located in the common dc bus. When a
power failure occurs, the static switch provides a fast disconnection between the ac line and the UPS system to
avoid any power accidents. The transformer is placed near the input side and provides a series connection
between the input and the auxiliary bidirectional converter.
The auxiliary bidirectional converter does not need to provide the power for the critical load. Therefore, it is
rated at 20% of the output power of the UPS. The main bidirectional converter is connected in parallel to the
load side of the system. In case of power failures, it has to provide the full power for the critical load.
Therefore, it is rated at 100% of the output power [15].
The system has two operation modes: normal mode of operation and backup mode of operation. When the
ac line is alive, the system operates in active ﬁltering mode. The auxiliary converter acts like a series active ﬁlter
and regulates voltage ﬂuctuations between the output and the input. It also forces the input current to be in
phase with the input voltage and then provides unity power factor for the load. At the same time, it controls
the dc link voltage of the system and charges the battery. During the normal operating mode, important

portion of the active power (usually up to 85%) directly ﬂows from the ac line to the critical load without any
conversion. Series and parallel converters draw only a small part of total active power to realize their active
ﬁltering tasks, control the dc bus, and charge the battery unit.
When the ac line is out of the preset tolerance, the static switch is off. The main converter operates as a
traditional inverter and supplies load from the battery unit without any interruption.
The main advantages of the delta-conversion UPS topology are high efﬁciency, low cost compared to the
on-line UPS, and applicability in high power rating. Disadvantages of this conﬁguration are a complex control
unit and lack of electrical isolation of the load from the ac line.
Rotary UPS
The energy conversion is realized by a motor/generator set in rotary UPS systems. In order to avoid idleness
for some components of the power and control circuits, the system can be combined as one machine by the
manufacturer. There are two types of rotary UPS systems on the market: ﬂywheel rotary UPS and diesel rotary
UPS [16]. A ﬂywheel rotary UPS consists of an ac motor, a ﬂywheel unit, an ac generator, a static switch, and
an optional bypass switch as shown in Figure 9.85. The ac motor and ac generator are mechanically coupled
through a ﬂywheel unit.
Instead of a battery, the ﬂywheel unit provides energy storage for the UPS in this topology. When the ac line is
out of power, the ﬂywheel unit produces dynamic energy for the generator and supplies the critical load through

the generator. Disadvantages of the ﬂywheel UPS are restricted frequency range, restricted speed range,
limitation on energy extraction, and huge ﬂywheel dimensions even for a few seconds of backup for the load.
Figure 9.86 shows the diesel rotary UPS schematically. An additional diesel engine is connected to the
motor/generator set via the clutch in this system. When the ac line is normal, the motor of the rotary UPS is
supplied by the utility. The generator delivers power to the critical load. When the ac line fails, the control unit
disconnects the ac motor from the power supply and the diesel engine begins to start up. Because of the start
up time, the diesel engine does not provide the power for the load instantly. During this time period, the load
is supplied by the rotational energy stored in the ﬂywheel unit. When the diesel engine moves at its rated
speed, the clutch is closed and the system operates as a diesel generator set to supply the critical load. Since the
system includes a ﬂywheel unit, it may have disadvantages in terms of the diameter and weight of the ﬂywheel.
In this topology, the ﬂywheel must be designed to accommodate the diesel engine start time.
The rotary UPS systems are more reliable than the static UPS systems. However, they are of larger size and
weight. Yet, they are preferred in high-power applications because of their high transient overload capability,
low EMI, and high efﬁciency.
Hybrid Static/Rotary UPS
Hybrid static/rotary UPS systems have the advantages of both static and rotary UPS systems. They have low
output impedance, low THD with nonlinear loads, high reliability, frequency stability, better isolation, and
low cost for maintenance.
A hybrid UPS can be considered similar to a static UPS in conﬁguration and operation. In both, an ac/dc
converter is used to charge a battery and supply the output dc/ac conversion stage. The inverter stage is
realized by the motor/generator set in the rotary UPS which is similar to the dc/ac converter of the static UPS.
The three battery-supported rotary UPS systems are shown in Figure 9.87. Hybrid static/rotary UPS systems
based on these three topologies are commercially available.
In Figure 9.87(a), a battery-supported hybrid UPS with dc motor is presented. It consists of an ac/dc
converter, a dc motor, an ac generator, a battery unit, and a static switch.
When the ac line is normal, the dc motor is fed from the ac line via the rectiﬁer and drives the generator.
The ac generator supplies the load. At the same time, the ac/dc converter charges the battery. When the ac line
fails, the battery unit directly supplies the dc motor and the ac generator delivers the power to the critical load.
In the case of an internal failure in the UPS system, the static bypass switch is turned on and the ac line directly
supplies the critical load. However, there is a transient time for the synchronizing of the ac line and the output
voltage [16].
Two other battery-supported hybrid UPS systems with an ac motor are shown in Figure 9.87 as well. The
only difference between the two topologies is the drive part of the motor/generator set [17]. Both topologies

use an ac motor to provide mechanical energy for the generator. To improve the system, manufacturers may
integrate the motor and generator as one machine. As a result, the topologies have small size, low weight, and
low cost compared to a conventional rotary UPS. Hybrid UPS systems are usually used in very high power
applications, i.e., several hundreds kVA.

UPS systems are used for power conditioning in the systems as well as providing uninterruptible and reliable

in many circumstances. Distributed and centralized approaches are two trends in UPS system development
today.
Distributed Approach
In a distributed UPS system, critical loads are supplied by many parallel UPS units, which are located in an
interconnected secure network. The power ﬂows between the UPS units and the critical load ﬂexibly [18].
There are two distributed UPS schemes in the literature: on-line and line-interactive distributed UPS
approaches.
The parallel UPS units are connected between the secure and utility networks in on-line distributed
topology as shown in Figure 9.88. dc links of the UPS units provide isolation between the secure and utility
networks. Loads are supplied by the ac line through the UPS units during the normal operation mode. UPS
units also provide reactive currents for the secure network loads. At the same time, the secure network is
isolated from the utility network current harmonics.
When a power failure occurs, the UPS batteries supply the secure network loads without any interruption. If
a UPS unit fails, it is rapidly disconnected from the network to prevent power disturbances. There is power
sharing between parallel UPS units. Therefore, other UPS units provide the power to the network instead of
disconnected UPS unit.
The line-interactive distributed approach is shown in Figure 9.89. There is only one network in this
conﬁguration instead of the utility and the secure networks. Therefore, the system has a simpler structure than
an online distributed conﬁguration [19]. The secure network is supplied by the ac mains during the normal
operating mode. The UPS units only operate during the failure mode. Therefore, the system is cost effective
compared to the online distributed approach. Moreover, each UPS unit includes only one inverter which
provides bidirectional power ﬂow for the system. Since the UPS unit does not have any rectiﬁer stage, the
system is more reliable and more efﬁcient than the online distributed approach [20].
The secure network loads are supplied by the ac line in the normal operation. At the same time, the inverters
charge the batteries and provide the reactive power for the secure network loads. The ac line absorbs all load
changes with a delaying process (such as 0.5 ms) because of the link inductance. In backup mode, the secure
network loads are supplied from the batteries. The system has to provide a seamless transition from the
normal mode to the backup mode. To achieve this, the inverter with high switching frequency (10 kHz) can
rapidly change the power angle from a negative value to a positive value.

Disadvantages of the distributed UPS systems are difﬁculty in achieving the load sharing and requirement of
very fast digital controllers. In addition, the monitoring of the whole system is difﬁcult.
Centralized Approach
There is only one large UPS unit to supply the secure network loads in the centralized approach as shown in
Figure 9.90. The large UPS provides continuous operation for the whole system. Since it requires low
maintenance, this approach is more attractive for industrial and utility applications. Disadvantages of the
centralized approach include high cost to achieve redundancy and to increase capacity of the load.
Furthermore, the system needs special staff for service and maintenance. However, this specially trained group
reduces the risk and increases the reliability of the system.
Control Techniques
The most important issue is the control strategy applied to the inverter in UPS systems. The control strategy
changes the output voltage THD and dynamic response of the system. In addition, power electronic
conﬁgurations used in the UPS affect the overall performance of the system.

Single Feedback Control Loop Method
To achieve regulated output voltage with low THD, the single voltage feedback loop is used in this method as
shown in Figure 9.91. Continuous and discontinuous approaches can be used as a feedback controller. The
most popular continuous feedback method is sine-triangle comparison or sinusoidal pulse width modulation
(SPWM) [21]. This method can be a natural sampling type, average type, or instantaneous type. In the
sampling approach, a feedback signal proportional to the peak value of the output voltage is compared with a
reference. The error is used to control the PWM modulator. The average type is almost the same except the
peak value of the output voltage is converted to an average value. Then, it is compared with a reference signal
to ﬁnd the error. These methods are suitable only at high switching frequencies. In addition, they can only
control the amplitude of the output voltage. To obtain better performance in low switching frequencies, digital
PWM techniques can be used. Speciﬁc harmonics can be minimized by calculating switching angles and also
the output ﬁlter size can be reduced with digital PWM strategies. To improve the dynamic performance of a
UPS inverter, an instantaneous type of PWM can be used. The output voltage is continuously compared with
the reference signal in this type of control.
Multiple Feedback Control Loop Method
To obtain better performance with nonlinear loads at low frequencies, multiple control strategies are
developed as shown in Figure 9.92. There are three control loops in this method: an outer, an inner, and a
minor. The output voltage is used by the outer control as a feedback signal (outer loop). Then, the obtained
feedback signal is compared with a reference signal to ﬁnd the error signal. A PI regulator compensates the
error to realize a stable output voltage under steady-state operation. This error is also compared with the
current signal from the output ﬁlter (inner loop). The sensed current signal from the output of the inverter is
used as feedback for the current regulator (minor loop). A minor loop provides fast dynamic responses,
achieving better performance with nonlinear or step-changing loads.
Conclusion
Since waveform quality, power reliability, and availability have become important issues for consumers and
utilities, the market of uninterruptible power supplies has seen considerable growth in the U.S. and worldwide.
Many different UPS topologies have been developed for solving these problems.

Lasers
Jeff Hecht
The word laser is an acronym for ‘‘light ampliﬁcation by the stimulated emission of radiation,’’ a phrase that
covers most, though not all, of the key physical processes inside a laser. Unfortunately, that concise deﬁnition
may not be very enlightening to the nonspecialist who wants to use a laser and cares less about its internal
physics than its external characteristics. From a practical standpoint, a laser can be considered as a source of a
narrow beam of monochromatic, coherent light in the visible, infrared, or ultraviolet parts of the spectrum.
The power in a continuous beam can range from a fraction of a milliwatt to around 25 kilowatts (kW) in
commercial lasers, and up to more than a megawatt in special military lasers. Pulsed lasers can deliver much
higher peak powers during a pulse, although the power averaged over intervals while the laser is off and on is
comparable to that of continuous lasers.
The range of laser devices is broad. The laser medium, i.e., the material emitting the laser beam, can be a
gas, liquid, glass, crystalline solid, or semiconductor crystal, and can range from the size of a grain of salt to big
enough to ﬁll the inside of a moderate-sized building. Lasers can take many forms including semiconductor
chips, optical ﬁbers, glass or crystalline rods, and gas-ﬁlled tubes. Not every laser produces a narrow beam of
monochromatic, coherent light. Edge-emitting semiconductor diode lasers, for example, produce beams that
spread out over an angle of 20 to 40–, hardly a pencil-thin beam. Liquid dye lasers and solid-state titanium-
doped sapphire lasers emit at a broad or narrow range of wavelengths, depending on the optics used with
them. Other types emit at a number of spectral lines, producing light that is neither truly monochromatic nor
coherent. Table 10.1 summarizes important commercial lasers.
Practically speaking, lasers contain three key elements. First is the laser medium itself, which generates the
laser light. Second is the power supply, which delivers energy to the laser medium in the form needed to excite
it to emit light. Third is the optical cavity or resonator, which concentrates the light to stimulate the emission
of laser radiation. All three elements can take various forms, and although they are not always immediately
evident in all types of lasers, their functions are essential. Figure 10.1 shows these elements in a ruby and a
helium-neon laser. Figure 10.2 shows two types of semiconductor diode lasers.

Laser-like devices called optical parametric oscillators have come into increasing use. They are more costly
and complex than lasers, but can be tuned across a broad range, with wavelengths from 0.2 to 4 micrometers.
Several general characteristics are common to most lasers that new users may not expect. Like most other light
sources, lasers are inefﬁcient in converting input energy into light. Efﬁciencies range from less than 0.001 to more

than 50%, but except for semiconductor and diode-pumped lasers, few types are much above 1% efﬁcient. These
low efﬁciencies can lead to special cooling requirements and duty-cycle limitations, particularly for high-power
lasers. In some cases, special equipment may be needed to produce the right conditions for laser operation, such
as cryogenic temperatures for lead salt semiconductor lasers. Operating characteristics of individual lasers
depend strongly on structural components such as cavity optics, and in many cases a wide range is possible.
Packaging can also havea strongimpact on lasercharacteristics and the use of lasersforcertain applications. Thus,
there are wide ranges of possible characteristics, although single devices will have much more limited ranges of
operation.
Differences from Other Light Sources
The basic differences between lasers and other light sources are the characteristics often used to describe a
laser: the output beam is narrow, the light is monochromatic, and the emission is coherent. Each of these
features is important for certain applications and deserves more explanation.
Most gas or solid-state lasers emit beams with a divergence angle of about a milliradian, meaning that
they spread to about 1 m in diameter after traveling a kilometer. (Edge-emitting semiconductor lasers
have a much larger beam divergence, but suitable optics can reshape the beam to make it much
narrower.) The actual beam divergence depends on the type of laser and the optics used with it. The fact
that laser light is contained in a beam serves to concentrate the output power onto a small area. Thus, a
modest laser power can produce a high intensity inside the small area of the laser beam; the intensity of
light in a 1 mW red diode laser beam is comparable to that of sunlight on a clear day, for example.
The beams from high-power lasers, delivering tens of watts or more of continuous power or higher
peak powers in pulses, can be concentrated to high enough intensities that they can weld, drill, or cut
many materials.
The laser beam’s concentrated light delivers energy only where it is focused. For example, a tightly focused
laser beam can write a spot on a light-sensitive material without exposing the adjacent area, allowing high-
resolution printing. Similarly, the beam from a surgical laser can be focused onto a tiny spot for microsurgery,
without heating or damaging surrounding tissue. Lenses can focus the parallel rays in a laser beam to a much
smaller spot than they can the diverging rays from a point source, a factor that helps compensate for the
limited light-production efﬁciency of lasers.
Most lasers deliver a beam that contains only a narrow range of wavelengths, and thus the beam can be
considered monochromatic for all practical purposes. Conventional light sources, in contrast, emit light over
much of the visible and infrared spectrum. For most applications, the range of wavelengths emitted by lasers is
narrow enough to make life easier for designers by avoiding the need for achromatic optics and simplifying the
task of understanding the interactions between laser beam and target. For some applications in spectroscopy
and communications, however, that range of wavelengths is not narrow enough, and special line-narrowing
options may be required.
One of the beam’s unique properties is its coherence, the property that the light waves it contains are
in phase with one another. Strictly speaking, all light sources have a ﬁnite coherence length or distance
over which the light they produce is in phase. However, for conventional light sources that distance is
essentially zero. For many common lasers, it is a fraction of a meter or more, allowing their use for
applications requiring coherent light. The most important of these applications is probably holography,
although coherence is useful in some types of spectroscopy. Spectroscopy also takes advantage of the
fact that laser light can be concentrated in a very narrow range of wavelengths, delivering a much
higher power in that narrow range than brighter sources which spread their light across a wide range
of wavelengths.
Some types of lasers have two further advantages over other light sources: higher power and longer
lifetime. For some high-power semiconductor lasers, lifetime must be traded off against higher power, but for
most others the life vs. power trade-off is minimal. The combination of high power and strong directionality
makes certain lasers the logical choice to deliver high light intensities to small areas. For some applications,
lasers offer longer lifetimes than do other light sources of comparable brightness and cost. In addition,

despite their low efﬁciency, some lasers may be more efﬁcient in converting energy to light than other
light sources.
The Laser Industry and Commercial Lasers
There is a big difference between the world of laser research and the world of the commercial laser industry.
Unfortunately, many text and reference books fail to differentiate between types of lasers that can be built in
the laboratory and those that are readily available commercially. This distinction is a crucial one for laser users.
Laser emission has been obtained from hundreds of materials at many thousands of emission lines in
laboratories around the world. Extensive tabulations of these laser lines are available (Weber, 1982), and even
today researchers are adding more lines to the list. However, most of these laser lines are of purely academic
interest. Many are weak lines close to much stronger lines that dominate the emission in practical lasers. Most
of the lasers that have been demonstrated in the laboratory have proved to be cumbersome to operate, low in
power, inefﬁcient, and/or simply less practical to use than other types.
Only a few dozen types of lasers have proved to be commercially viable on any signiﬁcant scale; these are
summarized in Table 10.1. Some of these types, notably the ruby and helium-neon lasers, have been around
since the beginning of the laser era, although their uses have decreased over the years. The most widely used
lasers today are semiconductor diode lasers used in CD players, laser pointers, laser printers, and ﬁber-optic
communication systems. Some lasers are in only limited production, and the economic realities of
manufacturing limit the number of different types of lasers that are commercially viable.
There are many possible reasons why certain lasers do not ﬁnd their way onto the market. Some require
exotic operating conditions or laser media, such as high temperatures or highly reactive metal vapors. Some
emit only feeble powers. Others have only limited applications, particularly lasers emitting low powers in the
far-infrared or in parts of the infrared where the atmosphere is opaque. Some simply cannot compete with
materials already on the market.
Deﬁning Terms
Coherence: The condition of light waves that stay in the same phase relative to each other; they must have
the same wavelength.
Continuous wave (CW): A laser that emits a steady beam rather than pulses.
Laser medium: The material in a laser that emits light; it may be a gas, solid, or liquid.
Monochromatic: Of a single wavelength or frequency.
Resonator: Mirrors that reﬂect light back and forth through a laser medium, usually on opposite ends of
a rod, tube, or semiconductor wafer. One mirror lets some light escape to form the laser beam.
Solid-state laser: A laser in which light is emitted by atoms in a glass or crystalline matrix. Laser specialists
do not consider semiconductor lasers to be solid-state types.

Properties of Light
The strict deﬁnition of light is electromagnetic radiation to which the eye is sensitive. Optical devices, however,
can operate over a larger range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and so the term usually refers to devices
which can operate in some part of the spectrum from the near ultraviolet (UV) through the visible range to
the near infrared. Figure 10.3 shows the whole spectrum and delineates these ranges.
Optical radiation is electromagnetic radiation and thus obeys and can be completely described by Maxwell’s
equations. We will not discuss this analysis here but just review the important properties of light.
Phase Velocity
In isotropic media light propagates as transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld
vectors are perpendicular to the propagation direction and orthogonal to each other. The velocity of light
propagation in a medium (the velocity of planes of constant phase, i.e., wavefronts) is given by
n ¼
cﬃﬃﬃ
em
p
ð10:1Þ
where c is the velocity of light in a vacuum (c ¼ 299,796 km/sec). The denominator in Equation (10.1) is a
term in optics called the refractive index of the medium:
n ¼
ﬃﬃﬃ
em
p
ð10:2Þ
FIGURE 10.3
Electromagnetic spectrum showing visible and optical wavelengths.
10-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

where e is the dielectric constant (permittivity) and m is the magnetic permeability. The wavelength of light, l,
which is the distance between phase fronts is
l ¼ l0
n ¼ n
u
ð10:3Þ
where l0 is the wavelength in vacuum and u is the light frequency. The refractive index varies with wavelength,
and this is referred to as the dispersive property of a medium.
Another parameter used to describe light frequency is wave number. This is given by
s ¼ 1
l
ð10:4Þ
and is usually expressed in cm1, giving the number of waves in a 1-cm path.
Group Velocity
When traveling in a medium, the velocity of energy transmission (e.g., a light pulse) is less than c and is
given by
u ¼ n  l dn
dl
ð10:5Þ
In vacuum the phase and group velocities are the same.
Polarization
Light polarization is deﬁned by the direction of the electric ﬁeld vector. For isotropic media this direction is
perpendicular to the propagation direction. It can exist in a number of states, described as follows.
Unpolarized.
The electric ﬁeld vector has a random and constantly changing direction, and
when there are multiple frequencies the vector directions are different for each frequency.
Linear.
The electric ﬁeld vector is conﬁned to one direction.
Elliptical.
The electric ﬁeld vector rotates, either left hand or right hand, at the light
frequency. The magnitude of the vector (intensity of the light) traces out an ellipse.
Circular.
Circular is the special case of the above where the electric ﬁeld vector
traces out a circle.
10-7
Optoelectronics

Absorption
Light in traveling through media can be absorbed. This can be represented in two ways. The light ﬂux
propagating through a medium can be written as
I ¼ I0eax
ð10:6Þ
where x is the distance through the medium with incident light ﬂux I0. a is the absorption coefﬁcient, usually
stated in cm1. An alternative way of describing absorption is to use the imaginary term in the media
refractive index. The complex refractive index is

nn ¼ nð1 þ ikÞ
ð10:7Þ
where k is the attenuation index. a and k are related as
a ¼ 4p
l0
nk
ð10:8Þ
Coherence
Light can be partially or fully coherent or incoherent, depending on the source and subsequent ﬁltering
operations. Common sources of light are incoherent because they consist of many independent radiators. An
example of this is the ﬂuorescent lamp in which each excited atom radiates light independently. There is no
ﬁxed phase relationship between the waves from these atoms. In a laser the light is generated in a resonant
cavity using a light ampliﬁer and the resulting coherent light has well-deﬁned phase fronts and frequency
characteristics.
Spatial and Temporal Coherence.
Spatial coherence describes the phase front properties of light. A beam
from a single-mode laser which has one well-deﬁned phase front is fully spatially coherent. A collection of light
waves from a number of light emitters is incoherent because the resulting phase front has a randomly
indeﬁnable form. Temporal coherence describes the frequency properties of light. A single-frequency laser
output is fully temporally coherent. White light, which contains many frequency components, is incoherent,
and a narrow band of frequencies is partially coherent.
Laser Beam Focusing
The radial intensity proﬁle of a collimated single-mode TEM00 (Gaussian) beam from a laser is given by
IðrÞ ¼ I0 exp 2 r2
w2
0
{
!
"
#
ð10:9Þ
where w0 is the beam radius (1/e2 intensity). This beam will diverge as it propagates out from the laser, and the
half angle of the divergence is given by
y1=2 ¼
l
pw0
ð10:10Þ
When this beam is focused by a lens the resulting light spot radius is given by
wf ¼ ll
pwd
ð10:11Þ
where l is the distance from the lens to the position of the focused spot and wd is the beam radius entering the
lens. It should be noted that l > f, the lens focal length, for a collimated beam entering the lens. However, l will
be a greater distance than f if the beam is diverging when entering the lens.

Geometric Optics
The wavelength of light can be approximated to zero for many situations. This permits light to be described in
terms of light rays which travel in the direction of the wave normal. This branch of optics is referred to
geometric optics.

When light travels from one medium into another, it changes propagation velocity
(Equation (10.1)). This results in refraction (bending) of the light as shown in Figure 10.4.
The change in propagation direction of the light ray is given by Snell’s law:
n1siny1 ¼ n2siny2
ð10:12Þ
where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of media 1 and 2, respectively.
Critical Angle.
When a light ray traveling in a medium is incident on a surface of a less dense medium,
there is an incidence angle y2, where sin y1 ¼ 1. This is the critical angle; for light incident at angles greater
than y2 the light is totally internally reﬂected as shown in Figure 10.4(b). The critical angle is given by
yc ¼ sin1(n1/n2).
Image Formation with a Lens
Many applications require a lens to focus light or to form an image onto a detector. A well-corrected lens
usually consists of a number of lens elements in a mount, and this can be treated as a black box system. The
characteristics of this lens are known as the cardinal points. Figure 10.5 shows how a lens is used to form an
image from an illuminated object.
The equation which relates the object, image, and lens system is

s2
ð10:13Þ
The image magniﬁcation is given by M ¼ s2/s1. When the object is very far away s1 is inﬁnite and the image is
formed at the back focal plane.
Incoherent Light
When two or more incoherent light beams are combined, the resulting light ﬂux is the sum of their energies.
For coherent light this is not necessarily true and the resulting light intensity depends on the phase
relationships between the electric ﬁelds of the two beams, as well as the degree of coherence.

and totally internally reﬂected.

Brightness and Illumination
The ﬂux density of a light beam emitted from a point source decreases with the square of distance from it.
Light sources are typically extended sources (being larger than point sources). The illumination of a surface
from light emitted from an extended source can be calculated using Figure 10.6.
The ﬂux incident on a surface element dA from a source element dS is given by
dE ¼ B dAcosy dScosC
r2
ð10:14Þ
The constant B is called the luminance or photometric brightness of the source. Its units are candles per square
meter (1 stilb ¼ p lamberts) and dE is the luminous ﬂux in lumens. The total illumination E of the surface
element is calculated by integrating over the source. The illuminance or ﬂux density on the surface is thus:
I ¼ E

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Two methods are commonly used for quantifying light energy, namely, the radiometric unit of watts and the
photometric unit of candelas. The candela is an energy unit which is derived from light emission from a
blackbody source. The two can be related using the relative visibility curve V(l), which describes the eye’s
sensitivity to the visible light spectrum, it being maximum near a wavelength of 550 nm. The constant which
relates lumens to watts at this wavelength is 685 lm/W. The luminous ﬂux emitted by a source can therefore be
written as
F ¼ 685 RVðlÞPðlÞdl
ðlumensÞ
ð10:16Þ
where V is the spectral response of the eye and P is the source radiant intensity in watts.
The source radiance is normally stated as luminance in candle per square centimeter (1 lumen per steradian
per square centimeter) or radiance in watts per square centimeter per steradian per nanometer. The lumen is
deﬁned as the luminous ﬂux emitted into a solid angle of a steradian by a point source of intensity 1/60th that
of a 1-cm2 blackbody source held at 2042 K temperature (molten platinum).
Thermal Sources
Objects emit and absorb radiation, and as their temperature is increased the amount of radiation emitted
increases. In addition, the spectral distribution changes, with proportionally more radiation emitted at shorter
wavelengths. A blackbody is deﬁned as a surface which absorbs all radiation incident upon it, and Kirchhoff’s
law of radiation is given by
W
a ¼ constant ¼ WB
ð10:17Þ
stating that the ratio of emitted to absorbed radiation is a constant a at a given temperature.
The energy or wavelength distribution for a blackbody is given by Planck’s law:
W ¼ c1
l5 exp c2
lT




1
ðwatts=cm2 area per mm wavelengthÞ
c1 ¼ 3:7413 · 104
c2 ¼ 1:4380 · 104
ð10:18Þ
T is in degrees Kelvin, l is in micrometers, and W is the power emitted into a hemisphere direction. Blackbody
radiation is incoherent, with atoms or molecules emitting radiation independently. Figure 10.7 is a plot of the
blackbody radiation spectrum for a series of temperatures.
Very few materials are true blackbodies; carbon lampblack is one. For this reason a surface emissivity is used
which describes the ratio of actual radiation emitted to that from a perfect blackbody. Table 10.2 is a listing of
emissivities for some common materials.
Tungsten Filament Lamp
In the standard incandescent lamp a tungsten ﬁlament is heated to greater than 2000–C, and it is protected
from oxidation and vaporization by an inert gas. In a quartz halogen lamp the envelope is quartz, which allows
the ﬁlament to run at a higher temperature. This increases the light output and gives a whiter wavelength
spectrum with proportionally more visible radiation to infrared.
Standard Light Source—Equivalent Black Blackbody
Because the emissivity of incandescent materials is less than 1, an equivalent source is needed for measurement
and calibration purposes. This is formed by using an enclosed space which has a small opening in it. Provided
the opening is much smaller than the enclosed area, the radiation from the opening will be nearly equal to that
from a blackbody at the same temperature, as long as the interior surface emissivity is 40.5. Blackbody
radiation from such a source at the melting point of platinum is deﬁned as 1/60 cd/cm2.
10-11
Optoelectronics

Arc Lamp
A gas can be heated to temperatures of 6000 K or more by generating an electric arc between two electrodes.
The actual resulting temperature is dependent on the current ﬂowing through the arc, the gas pressure and its
composition, and other factors. This does provide a light source which is close to the temperature of the sun.
Using an inert xenon gas results in essentially a white light spectrum. The use of a gas such as mercury gives
more light in the UV as well as a number of strong peak light intensities at certain wavelengths. This is due to
excitation and ﬂuorescence of the mercury atoms.
Fluorescent Lamp
A ﬂuorescent source is a container (transparent envelope) in which a gas is excited by either a dc discharge or
an RF excitation. The excitation causes the electrons of the gas to move to higher energy orbits, raising the
atoms to a higher excited state. When the atoms relax to lower states they give off energy, and some of this
energy can be light. The wavelength of the light is characteristically related to the energy levels of the excited
states of the gas involved. Typically a number of different wavelengths are associated with a particular gas.
Low-pressure lamps have relatively low luminance but provide light with narrow linewidths and stable
spectral wavelengths. If only one wavelength is required, then optical ﬁlters can be used to isolate it by blocking
the unwanted wavelengths.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Higher luminance is achieved by using higher gas pressures. The ﬂuorescent lamp is very efﬁcient since a
high proportion of the input electrical energy is converted to light. White light is achieved by coating the
inside of the container with various types of phosphor. The gas, for example a mercury–argon mixture,
provides UV and violet radiation which excites the phosphor. Since the light is produced by ﬂuorescence and
phosphorescence, the spectral content of the light does not follow Planck’s radiation law but is characteristic of
the coating (e.g., soft white, cool white).
Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
Light can be emitted from a semiconductor material when an electron and hole pair recombine. This is most
efﬁcient in a direct gap semiconductor like GaAs and the emitted photons have energy close to the bandgap
energy Eg. The wavelength is then given by
l > hc
Eg
ð10:19Þ
where h is Planck’s constant (6.626 · 1034 J-s) and c the velocity of light in vacuum. The spectral width of the
emission is quite broad, a few hundred nanometers, and is a function of the density of states, transition
probabilities, and temperature.
For light emission to occur, the conduction band must be populated with many electrons. This is achieved
by forward biasing a pn junction to inject electrons and holes into the junction region as shown in Figure 10.8.
Figure 10.9(a) shows the cross section of a surface emitting LED with an integral lens fabricated into the
surface. The light from the LED is incoherent and emitted in all directions. The lens and the bottom reﬂecting
surface increase the amount of light transmitted out of the front of the device. The output from the LED is
approximately linear with current but does decrease with increasing junction temperature.
Figure 10.9(b) shows an edge emitting LED. Here the light is generated in a waveguide region which
conﬁnes the light, giving a more directional output beam.
Various wavelengths are available and are obtained by using different bandgap semiconductors. This is
done by choosing different binary, ternary, and quaternary compositions. Table 10.3 is a listing of the more
common ones.
The output power is usually speciﬁed in milliwatts per milliamp current obtained in a given measurement
situation, e.g., into a ﬁber or with a 0.5 numerical aperture large area detector. Other parameters are peak
wavelength, wavelength band (usually full width half max), and temperature characteristics.

region where they recombine and emit light.

Optoelectronics

LEDs for Fiber Optic Communications
GaAs and InGaAsP LEDs are commonly used as sources for ﬁber optic communications. Since they are an
incoherent source, it is only practical to use them with multimode ﬁber. Only multimode ﬁber has a large
enough core diameter and numerical aperture (NA) to couple in enough light to be able to propagate any
useful distance. Applications for LEDs in ﬁber optics are for short distance links using glass or plastic ﬁber at
relatively low bandwidths, typically in Mb/sec rather than Gb/sec. Primary applications of these are for low
cost datalinks.
The detector can be packaged two ways: ﬁrst with a ﬁber pigtail directly attached to the detector package; or
a more common package is to have a ﬁber connector molded in as part of the package so that a connectorized
ﬁber can be plugged into it. Many LEDs for ﬁber optics are now packaged with electronic drive circuits to
form a transmitter module ready to receive standard format data signals.
Detectors, Semiconductor
When light interacts electronically with a medium, by changing the energy of electrons or creating carriers, for
example, it interacts in a quantized manner. The light energy can be quantized according to Planck’s theory:

where u is the light frequency and h is Planck’s constant. The b energy of each photon is very small; however, it
does increase with shorter wavelengths.
Photoconductors
Semiconductors can act as photoconductors, where incident light increases the carrier density, thus increasing
the conductivity. There are two basic types: intrinsic and extrinsic. Figure 10.10 shows a simple energy diagram
containing conduction and valence bands. Also indicated are the levels which occur with the introduction of
donor and acceptor impurities.
Intrinsic photoconduction effect is when a photon with energy hu, which is greater than the bandgap energy,
excites an electron from the valence band into the conduction band, creating a hole–electron pair. This
increases the conductivity of the material. The spectral response of this type of detector is governed by the
bandgap of the semiconductor.
In an extrinsic photoconductor (see Figure 10.10), the photon excites an electron from the valence band
into the acceptor level corresponding to the hole of the acceptor atom. The resulting energy hu is much smaller
than the bandgap and is the reason why these detectors have applications for long wavelength infrared sensors.
Table 10.4 is a list of commercial photoconductors and their peak wavelength sensitivities.
The doping material in the semiconductor determines the acceptor energy level, and so both the host material
and the dopant are named. Since the energy level is quite small it can be populated by a considerable amount by
thermal excitation. Thus, for useful detection sensitivity the devices are normally operated at liquid nitrogen
and sometimes liquid helium temperatures. The current response, i, of a photoconductor can be written as
i ¼ PZt0en

where P is the optical power at frequency u; h is Planck’s constant; v is drift velocity ¼ mE, where m is mobility and
E is electric ﬁeld; Z is quantum efﬁciency (at frequency u); t0 is lifetime of carriers; and e is charge on electron.
Charge Ampliﬁcation.
For semiconductor photoconductors such as CdS, there can be traps. These are holes,
which under the inﬂuence of a bias ﬁeld will be captured for a period of time. This allows electrons to move to
the anode instead of recombining with a hole, resulting in a longer period for the conduction increase. This
provides a photoconductive gain which is equal to the mean time the hole is trapped divided by the electron
transit time in the photoconductor. Gains of 104 are typical.
The charge ampliﬁcation can be written as
t0
td
ð10:22Þ
where td ¼ d/n, the drift time for a carrier to go across the semiconductor. The response time of this type of
sensor is consequently slow, ,10 msec, and the output in quite nonlinear.
Junction Photodiodes
In a simple junction photodiode, a pn-junction is fabricated in a semiconductor material. Figure 10.11 shows
the energy diagram of such a device with a reverse voltage bias applied. Incident light with energy greater than
the bandgap creates electrons in the p region and holes in the n region. Those that are within the diffusion
length of the junction are swept across by the ﬁeld. The light also creates electron–hole pairs in the junction
region, and these are separated by the ﬁeld. In both cases, an electron charge is contributed to the external
circuit. In the case of no bias, the carrier movement creates a voltage with p region being positive. The
maximum voltage is equal to the difference in the Fermi levels in the p and n regions and approaches the
bandgap energy Eg.
PIN Photodiodes.
The carriers that are generated in the junction region experience the highest ﬁeld and so,
being separated rapidly, give the fastest time response. The PIN diode has an extra intrinsic high ﬁeld layer
between the p and n regions, designed to absorb the light. This minimizes the generation of slow carriers and
results in a fast response detector.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

The output current is linear with incident power plus a constant dark current due to thermal generation of
carriers; Z is the quantum efﬁciency.
Avalanche Photodiodes
When the reverse bias of a photodiode is increased to near the breakdown voltage, carriers in the depletion
region can be accelerated to the point where they will excite electrons from the valence band into the
conduction band, creating more carriers. This current multiplication is called avalanche gain, and typical gains
of 50 are available. Avalanche diodes are specially designed to have uniform junction regions to handle the
high applied ﬁelds.
Detectors for Fiber-Optic Communications
A major application for junction photodioldes is detectors for ﬁber-optic communications. Silicon detectors
are typically used for short-wavelength light such as with GaAs sources. InP detectors are used for the 1.3- and
1.5-mm wavelength bands. The speciﬁc type and design of a detector are tailored to the ﬁber-optic application,
depending on whether it is low-cost lower-frequency datalinks or higher-cost high-frequency bit-rates in
Gb/sec. The detector is packaged either with a ﬁber pigtail or with a ﬁber connector receptacle molded as part
of the package body.
Fiber-optic detectors can also be packaged with pre-ampliﬁer electronics or complete receiver and com-
munications electronics into a module. For very high frequency response, it is important to minimize the
capacitance of the detector and the attached preampliﬁer circuit.
Solar Cells
Solar cells are large-area pn-junction photodiodes, usually in silicon, which are optimized to convert light to
electrical power. They are normally operated in the photovoltaic mode without a reverse voltage bias being
applied.
Linear Position Sensors
Large-area photodiodes can be made into single-axis and two-axis position sensors. The single-axis device is a
long strip detector, and the two-axis device is normally square. In the single-axis device, the common terminal
is in the middle and there are two signal terminals, one at each end. When a light beam is directed onto the
detector, the relative output current from each signal terminal depends on how close the beam is to the
terminal. The sum of the output currents from both terminals is proportional to the light intensity.
Phototransistors
For bipolar devices, the light generates carriers which inject current into the base of the transistor. This
modulates the collector base current, providing a higher output signal. For a ﬁeld effect device, the light
generates carriers that create a gate voltage. PhotoFETs can have very high sensitivities.
SEEDs
A self-electro-optic effect device (SEED) is a multiple quantum well semiconductor optical PIN device and
forms the combination of a photodiode and a modulator. It can operate as a photodetector where incident
light will generate a photocurrent in a circuit. It can also act as a modulator where the light transmitted
through the device is varied by an applied voltage.
Devices are normally connected in pairs to form symmetric SEEDs, as demonstrated in Figure 10.12(a).
These can then be operated as optical logic ﬂip-ﬂop devices. They can be set in one of two bistable states
by application of incident light beams. The bistable state can be read out by similar light beams
which measure the transmitted intensity. The hysteresis curve is shown in Figure 10.12(b). These and
similar devices are the emerging building blocks for optical logic and are sometimes referred to as smart
pixels.
10-17
Optoelectronics

Detectors, Photoemissive
In the photoemissive effect, light falls onto a surface (photocathode) and the light energy causes electrons to be
emitted. These electrons are then collected at a positively biased anode. There is a threshold energy required
for the electron to be emitted from the surface. This energy is called the work function, f, and is a property of
the surface material. The photon energy hu must be greater than f, and this determines the longest wavelength
sensitivity of the photocathode.
Vacuum Photodiodes
A vacuum photodiode comprises a negatively biased photocathode and a positive anode in a vacuum
envelope. Light falling on the cathode causes electrons to be emitted, and these electrons are collected at
the anode. Not all photons cause photoelectrons to be emitted, and quantum efﬁciencies, Z, typically run
0.5 to 20%. These devices are not very sensitive; however, they have very good linearity of current to incident
light power, P. They are also high-speed devices, with risetime being limited by the transit time ﬂuctuations of
electrons arriving at the anode. The photocurrent is given by
i ¼ PeZ
hu þ dark current
ð10:24Þ
This kind of detector exhibits excellent short-term stability. The emissive surface can fatigue with exposure
to light but will recover if the illumination is not excessive. Because of these properties, these devices have
been used for accurate light measurement, although in many cases semiconductor devices are now
supplanting them.
Gas-Filled Tubes
The light sensitivity of vacuum phototubes can be increased by adding 0.1 mm pressure of argon. The
photoelectrons under the inﬂuence of the anode voltage accelerate and ionize the gas, creating more electrons.
Gains of 5 to 10 can be realized. These devices are both low frequency, in the 10-kHz range, and nonlinear and
are suitable only for simple light sensors. Semiconductor devices again are displacing these devices for most
applications.

Photomultiplier Tubes
Photomultiplier tubes are the most sensitive light sensors, especially for visible radiation. Figure 10.13 is a
schematic showing the electrical circuit used to bias it and form the output voltage signal. Light is incident on
the photocathode, and the resulting photoelectrons are accelerated to a series of dynodes to generate
secondary electrons and through this electron multiplication amplify the signal. Gains of 108 can be achieved
with only minor degradation of the linearity and speed of vacuum photodiodes. The spectral response is
governed by the emission properties of the photocathode.
There are various types of photomultipliers with different physical arrangements to optimize for a speciﬁc
application. The high voltage supply ranges from 700 to 3000 V, and the electron multiplication gain is
normally adjusted by varying the supply voltage. The linearity of a photomultiplier is very good, typically 3%
over 3 decades of light level. Saturation is normally encountered at high anode currents caused by space charge
effects at the last dynode where most of the current is generated. The decoupling capacitors, C1, on the last few
dynodes are used for high-frequency response and to prevent saturation from the dynode resistors.
Photon Counting
For the detection of very low light levels and for measuring the statistical properties of light, photon counting
can be done using photomultipliers. A pulse of up to 108 electrons can be generated for each photoelectron
emitted from the cathode, and so the arrival of individual photons can be detected. There is a considerable
ﬁeld of study into the statistical properties of light ﬁelds as measured by photon counting statistics.
Imaging Detectors
A natural extension to single photodetectors is to arrange them in arrays, both linear single dimension and
two dimensions. Imaging detectors are made from both semiconductors and vacuum phototubes.
Semiconductor Detector Arrays
Detector arrays have been made using either photodiodes or photoconductors. The applications are for visible
and infrared imaging devices. For small-sized arrays each detector is individually connected to an electrical
lead on the package. This becomes impossible for large arrays, however, and these contain additional electronic
switching circuits to provide sequential access to each diode.
FIGURE 10.13
The basic layout of a photomultiplier tube showing the dynodes and the electrical circuit to bias them.
10-19
Optoelectronics

Figure 10.14 shows an example of a charge-coupled device (CCD) linear photodiode array. The device
consists of a linear array of pn-junction photodiodes. Each diode has capacitance associated with it, and when
light falls on the detector the resulting photocurrent charges this capacitance. The charge is thus the time
integral of the light intensity falling on the diode. The CCD periodically and sequentially switches the charge
to the video line, resulting in a series of pulses. These pulses can be converted to a voltage signal which
represents the light pattern incident on the array.
The location of the diodes is accurately deﬁned by the lithographic fabrication process and, being solid state,
is also a rugged detector. These devices are thus very suitable for linear or two-dimensional optical image
measurement. The devices can be quite sensitive and can have variable sensitivity by adjusting the CCD scan
speed since the diode integrates the current until accessed by the CCD switch. The spectral sensitivity is that of
the semiconductor photodiode, and the majority of devices now available are silicon. Smaller arrays are
becoming more available in many types of semiconductors, however.
Image-Intensiﬁer Tubes
An image-intensiﬁer tube is a vacuum device which consists of a photoemissive surface onto which a light
image is projected, an electron accelerator, and a phosphor material to view the image. This device, shown in
Figure 10.15, can have a number of applications, for example, brightening a very weak image for night vision
or converting an infrared image into a visible one.
FIGURE 10.14

charge from each photodiode to the video line.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Light falling on the cathode causes electrons to be emitted in proportion to the light intensity. These
electrons are accelerated and focused by the applied electric ﬁeld onto the ﬂuorescent screen to form a visible
image. Luminance gains of 50 to 100 times can be achieved, and a sequence of devices can be used to magnify
the gain even more.
Image Orthicon Tube (TV Camera)
There are two basic types of television (TV) camera tubes, the orthicon and the vidicon. The orthicon uses the
photoemissive effect. A light image is focused onto the photocathode, and the electrons emitted are attracted
toward a positively based target (see Figure 10.16). The target is a wire mesh, and the electrons pass through it
to be collected on a glass electron target screen. This also causes secondary electrons to be emitted, and they
also collect on the screen. This results in a positive charge image which replicates the light image on the
photocathode.
A low-velocity electron beam is raster scanned across the target to neutralize the charge. The surplus
electrons return to the electron multiplier and generate a current for the signal output. The output current is
thus inversely proportional to the light level at the scanning position of the beam. The orthicon tube is very
sensitive because there is both charge accumulation between scans and gain from the electron multiplier.
Vidicon TV Camera Tube
A simple TV camera tube is the vidicon. This is the type used in camcorders and for many video applications
where a rugged, simple, and inexpensive camera is required. Figure 10.17 is a schematic of a vidicon tube;
the optical image is formed on the surface of a large-area photoconductor, causing corresponding variations
in the conductivity. This causes the rear surface to charge toward the bias voltage Vb in relation to the
conductivity image. The scanning electron beam periodically recharges the rear side to 0 V, resulting in a
recharging current ﬂow in the output. The output signal is a current signal proportional to the light incident
at the position of the scanning electron beam.
FIGURE 10.16
Schematic diagram of an image orthicon TV camera tube.
FIGURE 10.17
Schematic of a vidicon TV camera tube.
10-21
Optoelectronics

The primary disadvantages of the vidicon are its longer response time and smaller dynamic range. The
recent availability of longer wavelength photoconducting ﬁlms has resulted in new infrared cameras becoming
available.
A recent advance in these types of image sensor is to replace the photoconductor with a dense array of very
small semiconductor photodiodes. Photocurrent in the diode charges a capacitor connected to it. The raster
scanned electron beam discharges this capacitor in the same way.
Image Dissector Tube
The image dissector tube is a photosensitive device which uses an electron deﬂection lens to image the electron
from the cathode onto a pinhole in front of an electron multiplier. The image can be deﬂected around in front
of the pinhole in a random access manner. The primary application of this kind of device is for tracking
purposes.
Noise and Detectivity
Noise
There are two primary sources of noise in photodetectors: Johnson noise due to thermal effects in the resistive
components of the device and its circuits, and shot noise or its equivalent, which is due to the quantized
nature of electro-optic interactions. In semiconductor devices noise is usually given in terms of noise current,
d
ii 2 ¼ 2eiM2þxDf þ 4kTDf
R
ð10:25Þ
where i includes signal and dark currents, e is electron charge, M is avalanche gain (x depends on avalanche
photodetector characteristics), Df is frequency bandwidth, k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is in degrees Kelvin,
and R is the total circuit resistance at temperature, T.
For photoconductor devices (including effects of charge ampliﬁcation) the noise current is given by
d
ii 2 ¼ 4eiðt0=tdÞDf

R
ð10:26Þ
The ﬁrst term is analogous to shot noise but includes the effects of carrier creation and recombination. t0 is the
carrier lifetime, td is the drift time for a carrier to go across the photoconductor, and u is the light frequency.
The noise for photoemissive devices is usually written as a noise voltage and is given by
d2

The performance of a detector is often described using the term D*, detectivity. This term is useful for
comparison purposes by normalizing with respect to detector size and/or noise bandwidth. This is written as

where NEP is the noise equivalent power (for signal-to-noise ratio equal to 1) and A is detector area. The term

blackbody radiation source.

In 1969, Stewart Miller of AT&T Bell Laboratories published his landmark article on integrated optics. This
article laid the foundation for what has now developed into optoelectronic circuits. In it he described the
concepts of planar optical guided-wave devices formed as thin ﬁlms on various substrates using fabrication
techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry. The attributes of
these new circuits included small size, weight, power consumption, and mechanical robustness, because all
components were integrated on a single substrate. The ﬁeld of optoelectronic circuits began as a hybrid
implementation where optical sources (laser diodes) and detectors have historically been fabricated on
separate semiconductor substrates, and waveguide devices, such as modulators and switches, have been
fabricated on electro-optic single-crystal oxides such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3). Often, the two dissimilar
substrates have been connected using single-mode polarization preserving optical ﬁber. Now, although the
hybrid concept has found widespread commercial applications in telecommunications and sensors, most
10-23
Optoelectronics

active research is performed on monolithic implementations, where all devices are fabricated on a common
semiconductor substrate. After a discussion of semiconductor, glass, and polymer material systems, we will
deal exclusively with the most mature hybrid implementation of optoelectronic circuits based on LiNbO3.
Hundreds of thousands of LiNbO3 digital electro-optic modulators are in use today in OC-48 (2.5 Gb/sec) and
OC-192 (10 Gb/sec) ﬁber-optic communication systems.
Because sources and detectors have been covered in previous sections, in this section the devices that are
utilized in between, such as modulators and switches, will be discussed.
Integrated Optics
Integrated optics can be deﬁned as the monolithic integration of one or more optical guided-wave structures
on a common substrate. These structures can be passive, such as a ﬁxed optical power splitter, or active, such
as an optical switch. Active devices are realized by placing metal electrodes in close proximity to the optical
waveguides. Applying a voltage to the electrodes changes the velocity of the light within the waveguide.
Depending on the waveguide geometry and the electrode placement, a wide variety of technologically useful
devices and circuits can be realized.
The technological signiﬁcance of integrated optics stemmed from its natural compatibility with two other
rapidly expanding technologies: ﬁber optics and semiconductor laser diodes. These technologies have moved
in the past 15 years from laboratory curiosities to large-scale commercial ventures. Integrated optic devices
typically use laser diode optical sources or diode-pumped yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) lasers, and
transmit the modiﬁed optical output in a single-mode optical ﬁber. Integrated optic devices are typically very
high speed, compact, and require only moderate control voltages compared to their bulk-optical counterparts.
In integrated optic devices, the optical channel waveguides are formed on a thin, planar, optically polished
substrate using photolithographic techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor IC industry.
Waveguide routing is accomplished by the mask used in the photolithographic process, similar to the way
electrically conductive paths are deﬁned in semiconductor ICs. The photolithographic nature of device
fabrication offers the potential of readily scaling the technology to large volumes, as is done in the
semiconductor IC industry. For example, the typical device is 0.75 in. · 0.078 in. in size. Dividing the substrate
size by the typical device size and assuming a 50% area usage indicates that one can achieve over 100 devices
per 4-in. wafer.
Substrate materials for integrated optics include semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP, glass, polymer
coated glass or Si, and LiNbO3. In the past ﬁve years, primarily passive glass-based devices have been
commercially introduced as replacements for passive all-ﬁber devices, such as splitters and combiners. In
addition, there are slow-speed (millisecond) switches and voltage-controlled variable optical attenuators
(VOA) now available, which utilize the thermooptic effect in glass. Glass-based devices are fabricated by either
depositing glass waveguiding layers on Si, or through the indiffusion of dopants into glass, which results in a
waveguiding layer. Both fabrication approaches are used in commercially available devices.
Recently, low-speed polymer-on-Si switches have been commercially introduced. These also operate via the
thermooptic effect. However, since polymers can be engineered with electrooptic properties, high-speed
devices have also become available. The primary impediment to market penetration of electrooptic polymer-
based devices has been their relatively poor stability, especially at temperatures above 100–C. However, if
polymers can be produced with both strong electrooptic properties and enhanced stability at elevated
temperatures, they could be the material system of choice for many applications because of their low-cost
potential.
The area of semiconductor-based integrated optics has attracted much attention worldwide because it offers
the potential of integrating electronic circuitry, optical sources and detectors, and optical waveguides on a
single substrate. Being quite promising, the technology has recently become commercialized. Both electro-
optic (EO) and electro-absorption (EA) modulators based on both GaAs and InP are available commercially.
The EA modulators are typically used in OC-48 or shorter-reach OC-192 ﬁber-optic systems, whereas the EO
modulators are used almost exclusively for longer-reach OC-192 systems. These modulators are usually
integrated in a hybrid fashion with the semiconductor optical source, although the EA modulator can be
10-24
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

integrated on the same substrate as the laser diode. Technical problems in semiconductor-based integrated
optics include lower electrooptic coefﬁcients, higher optical waveguide attenuation, and an incompatibility of
the processing steps needed to fabricate the various types of devices on a single substrate. However,
considerable attention is being paid to these problems, and improvements are continually occurring.
The devices discussed up to this point can be classiﬁed as linear. There is also an emerging class of devices
that utilize nonlinear optical effects, such as second harmonic generation (SHG), for example. These devices
can be very useful for wavelength conversion and dispersion compensation, and have recently been
commercially introduced.
The primary substrate material in integrated optics today is the widely available synthetic crystal, LiNbO3,
which has been commercially produced in volume for more than 30 years. This material is transparent to
optical wavelengths between 400 nm and 4500 nm, has a hardness similar to glass, and is nontoxic.
LiNbO3-based devices have been commercially available since 1985, and since 1995 have been ﬁelded in a
large number of ﬁber-optic telecommunication systems. The basic LiNbO3 waveguide fabrication technique
was developed in 1974, and has been continually reﬁned and improved during subsequent years. The material
itself ﬁnds wide application in a number of electrical and optical devices because of its excellent optical,
electrical, acoustic, and electro- and acousto-optic properties. For example, almost all color television sets
manufactured today incorporate a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) electrical ﬁlter based on LiNbO3.
In LiNbO3-based integrated optics, optical waveguides are formed in one of two ways. The ﬁrst uses
photolithographically patterned lines of titanium (Ti), several hundred angstroms thick, on the substrate
surface. The titanium is then diffused into the substrate surface at a temperature of about 1000–C for several
hours. This process locally raises the refractive index in the regions where titanium has been diffused, forming
high-refractive index stripes that will conﬁne and guide light. Because the diffusion is done at exceedingly high
temperatures, the waveguide stability is excellent. The waveguide mechanism used is similar to that used in
ﬁber optics, where the higher-index, doped cores guide the light. The exact titanium stripe width, the titanium
thickness, and diffusion process are critical parameters in implementing a low-loss single-mode waveguide.
Different fabrication recipes are required to optimize the waveguides for operation at the three standard diode
laser wavelengths: 800 nm, 1300 nm, and 1500 nm. The second approach uses a technique known as proton
exchange. In this approach, a mask is used to deﬁne regions of the substrate where hydrogen will be exchanged
for lithium, resulting in an increase in the refractive index. This reaction takes place at lower temperatures
(200 to 250–C) but has been found to produce stable waveguides if an anneal at 350 to 400–C is performed.
Waveguides formed using the proton exchange method support only one polarized mode of propagation,
whereas those formed using Ti indiffusion support two. Proton exchange waveguides are also capable of
handling much higher optical power densities, especially at the shorter wavelengths, than are those formed by
Ti indiffusion. More fabrication detail will be provided later.
Light modulation is realized via the electro-optic effect, i.e., inducing a small change in the waveguide
refractive index by applying an electric ﬁeld within the waveguide. On an atomic scale the applied electric ﬁeld
causes slight changes in the basic crystal unit cell dimensions, which changes the crystal’s refractive index. The
magnitude of this change depends on the orientation of the applied electric ﬁeld and the optical polarization.
As a result, only certain crystallographic orientations are useful for device fabrication and devices are typically
polarization dependent. The electro-optic coefﬁcients of LiNbO3 are among the highest (30.8 pm/V for r33) of
any inorganic material, making the material very attractive for integrated optic applications.
Combining the concepts of optical waveguides and electro-optic modulation with the geometric freedom of
photolithographic techniques leads to an extremely diverse array of passive and active devices.
Passive components do not require any electric ﬁelds and are used for power splitting and combining
functions. Two types of passive power division structures have been fabricated: Y-junctions and directional
couplers. A single waveguide can be split into two by fabricating a shallow-angle Y-junction as shown in
Figure 10.18.
An optical signal entering from the single-waveguide side of the junction is split into two optical signals
with the same relative phase but one half the original intensity. Conversely, light incident on the two-
waveguide side of the junction will be combined into the single waveguide with a phase and intensity
dependent on the original inputs. Directional couplers consist of two or more waveguides fabricated in close
10-25
Optoelectronics

proximity to each other so that the optical ﬁelds overlap as shown in Figure 10.19. As a result, optical power is
transferred between the waveguides. The extent of the power transfer is dependent on the waveguide
characteristics, the waveguide spacing, and the interaction length.
A different type of passive component is an optical polarizer which can be made using several different
techniques. One such method is the metal-clad, dielectric-buffered waveguide shown in Figure 10.20.
In this passive device, the TM polarization state is coupled into the absorbing metal and is thus attenuated,
while the TE polarization is virtually unaffected. Measurements of a 2 mm long polarizer of this type have
demonstrated TM attenuations exceeding 50 dB (100,000:1). Polarizers can also be fabricated in others ways.
One interesting technique involves the diffusion of hydrogen ions into the LiNbO3. This results in a waveguide
that, as discussed earlier, will only support the TE-polarized mode and, thus, is a natural polarizer.
Active components are realized by placing electrodes in close proximity to the waveguide structures.
Depending on the substrate crystallographic orientation, the waveguide geometry, and the electrode geometry,

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

a wide variety of components can be demonstrated. The simplest active device is the phase modulator which is
a single waveguide with electrodes on either side as shown in Figure 10.21.
Applying a voltage across the electrodes induces an electric ﬁeld across the waveguide, which changes its
refractive index via the electro-optic effect. For 800-nm wavelength operation, a typical phase modulator
would be 6 mm long and would induce a p-phase shift for an applied voltage of 4 V. The transfer function
(light out vs. voltage in) can be expressed as
I0ðVÞ ¼ Ii expðjotþpV=VpÞ;
ð10:29Þ
where Vp is the voltage required to cause a 180– phase shift. Note that there is no change in the intensity of the
light. Coherent techniques are used to measure the amount of phase change.
Optical intensity modulators can be fabricated by combining two passive Y-junctions with a phase modu-
lator situated between them. The result, which is shown in Figure 10.22, is a guided-wave implementation of
the classic Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
In this device the incoming light is split into two equal components by the ﬁrst Y-junction. An electrically
controlled differential phase shift is then introduced by the phase modulator, and the two optical signals are
recombined in the second Y-junction. If the two signals are exactly in phase, then they recombine to excite the
lowest-order mode of the output waveguide and the intensity modulator is turned fully on. If instead there
exists a p-phase shift between the two signals, then they recombine to form the second mode, which is radiated
into the substrate and the modulator is turned fully off. Contrast ratios greater than 25 dB (300:1) are
routinely achieved in commercial devices. The transfer function for the Mach–Zehnder modulator can be
FIGURE 10.22
Mach–Zehnder intensity modulator and transfer function.
FIGURE 10.21
Electro-optic integrated optic phase modulator.

Optoelectronics

expressed as
I0ðVÞ ¼ Iicos2ðpV=2VpþjÞ;
ð10:30Þ
where Vp is the voltage required to turn the modulator from on to off, and w is any static phase imbalance
between the interferometer arms. This transfer function is shown graphically in Figure 10.22. Note that the
modulator shown in Figure 10.22 has push–pull electrodes. This means that when a voltage is applied, the
refractive index is changed in opposite directions in the two arms, yielding a twice-as-efﬁcient modulation.
Optical switches can be realized using a number of different waveguide, electrode, and substrate orientations.
Two different designs are used in commercially available optical switches: the balanced-bridge and the Db
directional coupler. The balanced-bridge design is similar to that of the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, except
that the Y-junctions have been replaced by 3-dB directional couplers as shown in Figure 10.23.
Similar to the Mach–Zehnder, the ﬁrst 3-dB coupler splits the incident signal into two signals, ideally of
equal intensity. Once again, if a differential phase shift is electro-optically induced between these signals, then
when they recombine in the second 3-dB coupler, the ratio of power in the two outputs will be altered.
Contrast ratios greater than 20 dB (100:1) are routinely achieved in commercial devices. The transfer function
for this switch can be expressed as
I0a¼ Iicos2ðpV/2Vp þ p/2Þ
ð10:31Þ
I0b¼ Iisin2ðpV/2Vp þ p/2Þ
ð10:32Þ
and is graphically depicted in Figure 10.23.
In the other type of switch, the Db directional coupler, the electrodes are placed directly over the directional
coupler as shown in Figure 10.24.
The applied electric ﬁeld alters the power transfer between the two adjacent waveguides. Research versions
of this switch have demonstrated contrast ratios greater than 40 dB (10,000:1); however, commercial versions
typically achieve 20 dB, which is competitive with that achieved with the balanced-bridge switch. The transfer
function for the Db directional coupler switch can be expressed as
I0a ¼ sin2KL*sqrtð1 þ ðDb=2KÞ2Þ=ð1 þ ðDb=2KÞ2Þ
ð10:33Þ
I0b ¼ 1  I0a
ð10:34Þ
FIGURE 10.23

where K is the coupling constant and Db is the voltage-induced change in the propagation constant. This
transfer function is depicted in Figure 10.24.
Another type of active component that is commercially available is the polarization controller. This
component allows the incoming optical polarization to be continuously adjustable. The device functions as an
electrically variable optical waveplate, where both the birefringence and axis orientation can be controlled.
The controller is realized by using a three-electrode conﬁguration as shown in Figure 10.25 on a substrate
orientation where the TE and TM optical polarizations have almost equal velocities. Typical performance
values are TE/TM conversion of greater than 99% with less than 50 V applied.
One of the great strengths of integrated optic technology is the possibility of integrating different types or
multiple copies of the same type of device on a single substrate. While this concept is routinely used in the
semiconductor IC industry, its application in the optical domain is novel. The scale of integration in
integrated optics is quite modest by semiconductor standards. To date, the most complex component
demonstrated is a 16 · 16 optical switch matrix that uses 256 identical 2 · 2 optical switches. The greatest
device diversity on a given substrate is found in ﬁber gyro applications. Here, components incorporating six
phase modulators, two electrically tunable directional couplers, and two passive directional couplers have been
demonstrated.

Device Fabrication
The fabrication of an integrated optic device uses some of the same techniques as used in the semiconductor
IC industry. Device designs are ﬁrst entered into a computer-aided design (CAD) system for accurate feature
placement and dimensional control. This design is then output as a digital ﬁle that will control a pattern
generation system for fabrication of the chrome masks that are used in device fabrication. A variety of
equipment, such as step-and-repeat and E-beam systems, has been developed for the semiconductor IC
industry for the generation of chrome masks. These same systems are used today for generation of masks for
integrated optic devices.
The waveguides can be fabricated by using either the Ti indiffusion method or the proton exchange method.
The ﬁrst step in fabricating a waveguide device using Ti indiffusion is patterning in titanium. The bare LiNbO3
surface is ﬁrst cleaned and then coated with photoresist. Next, the coated substrate is exposed using the
waveguide-layer chrome mask. The photoresist is then developed. The areas that have been exposed are removed
in the development cycle. The patterned substrates are then coated with titanium in a vacuum evaporator.
The titanium covers the exposed regions of the substrate as well as the surface of the remaining photoresist.
The substrate is soaked in a photoresist solvent. This causes all the residual photoresist (with titanium on top)
to be removed, leaving only the titanium that coated the bare regions of the substrate. This process is known
as lift-off. Finally, the substrate, which is now patterned with titanium, is placed in a diffusion system.
At temperatures above 1000–C the titanium diffuses into the substrate, slightly raising the refractive index of
these regions. This process typically takes less than 10 hours. This sequence of steps is depicted in Figure 10.26.
The proton exchange method is depicted in Figure 10.27. Here, a chrome or an oxide masking layer is ﬁrst
deposited on the LiNbO3 substrate. It is patterned using photoresist and etching. Next, the substrate is
submerged in hot benzoic acid or some other suitable protonic source. Finally, the masking layer is removed
and the substrate is annealed. The regions that have been exposed to the protonic source will have an increased
refractive index and will guide light.
If the devices being fabricated are to be active (i.e., voltage controlled), then an electrode fabrication step is
also required. This sequence of steps parallels the waveguide fabrication sequence. The only differences are that
FIGURE 10.26
Ti-indiffused LiNbO3 waveguide fabrication.
10-30
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

an electrode mask is used and the vacuum-deposited metal used is chrome/gold or chrome/aluminum. This
sequence of steps is shown in Figure 10.28.
In order to get the light in and out of the waveguide, the endfaces have to be lapped and polished ﬂat with
chip-free knife edges. This is currently accomplished using standard lapping and polishing techniques. After
this step, the substrate can be diced into as many devices as were included on the substrate. Finally, the diced
parts need to be electrically and optically packaged.
Packaging
To get the light in and out of an integrated optic waveguide requires a tiny optical window to be polished on to
the waveguide’s end. Currently, the entire endface of the substrate is polished to a sharp, nearly perfect corner,
making the whole endface into an optical window. An optical ﬁber can then be aligned to the waveguide end
and attached. Typically, centration of the ﬁber axis to the waveguide axis must be better than 0.2 mm. Some
devices require multiple inputs and outputs. In this case the ﬁbers are prealigned in silicon V-grooves. These
V-grooves are fabricated by anisotropic etching of a photolithographically deﬁned pattern on the silicon. The
center-to-center spacing of the ﬁber V-groove array can be made to closely match that of the multiple
waveguide inputs and outputs.
Integrated optic devices built on LiNbO3 are inherently single-mode devices. This means that the light is
conﬁned in a cross-sectional area of approximately 30 mm2. The optical mode has a near-ﬁeld pattern that
is 5 to 10 mm across and 3 to 6 mm deep, depending on the wavelength. These mode spot sizes set limits on
how light can be coupled in and out. There are a number of methods that can be used to couple the light
into LiNbO3 waveguides. These include prism coupling, grating coupling, end-ﬁre coupling with lenses, and
end-ﬁre coupling with single-mode optical ﬁbers. In general, most of these techniques are only useful for
laboratory purposes. The most practical real-world technique is end-ﬁre coupling with an optical ﬁber. In
this case the optical ﬁber is aligned to the waveguide end. This is an excellent practical method since
FIGURE 10.27
Proton exchange LiNbO3 waveguide fabrication.
10-31
Optoelectronics

integrated optic devices are most often used in ﬁber optic systems. Therefore, the coupling problem is one of
aligning and ﬁxing a single-mode ﬁber to the single-mode LiNbO3 waveguide. The size of the single-mode
radiation pattern and its angular divergence set the alignment tolerances. A low-loss connection between a
ﬁber and a LiNbO3 waveguide requires 51/20 of a mode spot diameter (0.25 to 0.5 mm) in transverse
offset, angular tilt of 52 degrees, and a longitudinal offset of 51 mode spot diameter (5 to 10 mm). These
are very stringent alignment requirements, especially if they have to be maintained over a wide operating
temperature range.
Another aspect of the problem is that many integrated optic devices require a single, well-deﬁned linearly
polarized input. Ordinary single-mode ﬁber is not suitable in this case. The solution is to use polarization-
preserving ﬁber. This ﬁber is made such that it will maintain a single linearly polarized input over long
distances. The use of polarization preserving ﬁber, however, adds another requirement to the coupling
problem. This requirement is that the ﬁber must be rotationally aligned about its cylindrical axis so that the
linearly polarized light coincides with the desired rotational axis of the LiNbO3 waveguide. The rotational
precision needed can be 50.5–.
Many LiNbO3 devices, such as ﬁber gyro components, require multiple input and/or output optical
connections. Thus, the packaging must be able to accommodate multiple inputs/outputs and maintain strict
alignment for all connections.
The method of end-ﬁre coupling optical ﬁbers to the LiNbO3 waveguide is commonly called pigtailing. This
is the only practical packaging method now used for integrated optic devices that operate in a real system and
outside the laboratory. The reasons for this are quite logical. The end user installs the device in his system by
connecting to the ﬁber pigtails. The connection can be made with single-mode connectors or by splicing.
Flexibility is one of the big advantages of using ﬁber pigtails.
The typical LiNbO3 device is packaged in a metallic case with optical ﬁber pigtails connected at both ends.
Electrical connections are provided by rf connectors or pins, which are common in the electronics industry.
If hermetically sealed packages are desired, then the optical ﬁber pigtails must be hermetically sealed to the
metallic package.

Applications
Many useful systems have been accomplished using LiNbO3-based integrated optic devices. These system
applications can be grouped into four broad categories: telecommunications, instrumentation, signal
processing, and sensors. In some cases, only a single integrated optic device is used, while in other applications
a multifunction component is required.
Optical modulators have been shown to be quite useful in the telecommunications area. Hundreds of
thousands of high-speed modulators for digital transmission at OC-48 (2.5 Gb/sec), OC-192 (10 Gb/sec), and
OC-768 (40 Gb/sec) are in commercial use. In addition, the ability of the Mach–Zehnder intensity modulator
to control intensity with a controlled wavelength change (i.e., chirp) has made its use in long-haul
telecommunications systems the preferred choice.
Aside from the telecommunication application, there also is the high-speed analog modulation application.
Analog transmission systems using integrated optic devices are particularly attractive as remote antenna links
because of their high speed and ability to be driven directly by the received signal without ampliﬁcation. The
use of high-power diode lasers operating at 1300 and 1500 nm and external intensity modulators based on
LiNbO3 has found wide application in the cable TV industry. Another demonstrated application of integrated
optics in the telecommunications area is in coherent communication systems. These systems require both
phase modulators and polarization controllers. Current optical ﬁber transmission systems rely on intensity
modulated data transmission schemes. Coherent communication systems are attractive because of the promise
of higher bit rates, wavelength division multiplexing capability, and greater noise immunity. In coherent
communication systems the information is coded by varying either the phase or frequency of the optical
carrier with a phase modulator. At the receiver, a polarization controller is used to ensure a good signal-to-
noise ratio in the heterodyne detection system.
One promising application of integrated optic devices in instrumentation is a high-speed, polarization-
independent optical switch for use in optical-time-domain reﬂectometers (OTDR). OTDRs are used to locate
breaks or poor splices in ﬁber-optic networks. The instruments work by sending out an optical pulse and
measuring the backscattered radiation returning to the instrument as a function of time. By employing an
optical switch, which will be used to rapidly switch the optical ﬁber under test from the pulsed light source to
the OTDR receiver, the instrument could detect faults closer to the OTDR than currently possible, which is
very important in short-haul METRO systems now being installed. This feature is also necessary for local area
network (LAN) installations.
Several types of sensors using integrated optic devices have been demonstrated. Two of the most promising
are electric/magnetic ﬁeld or voltage sensors and rotation sensors (ﬁber-optic gyro). Electric ﬁeld sensors
typically consist of either a Mach–Zehnder intensity modulator or an optical switch that is biased midway
between the on and off states. For small modulation depths about this midpoint the induced optical
modulation is linear with respect to applied voltage. Linear dynamic ranges in excess of 80 dB have been
accomplished. This is larger than that obtained using any other known technology.
Perhaps the most promising near-term application of integrated optic devices in the ﬁeld of rotation sensing is
as a key component in optical ﬁber gyroscopes. A typical ﬁber-optic gyro component is shown in Figure 10.29.
The device consists of a polarizer, a Y-junction, and two phase modulators, all integrated on a single
substrate. In ﬁber gyro systems, the integrated optic component replaces individual, ﬁber-based components
that perform the same function. The integrated optic component offers greatly improved performance, at a
signiﬁcant reduction in cost, compared to the ﬁber-based components. Most ﬁber-optic gyro development
teams have done away with the ﬁber components and have adopted LiNbO3-based components as the
technology of choice.
Summary
Optical circuits have made impressive commercial in-roads over the past ﬁve years. Revenues from such
products exceed several hundred million dollars a year. As manufacturing and packaging costs are reduced,
this amount is expected to substantially increase over the next ﬁve years.

Introduction
Fang Lin Luo and Hong Ye
A digital-to-analog (D/A) converter (or DAC) is the circuitry to convert digital codes (parallel or series) to
continuous analog signals. An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter (ADC) is the circuitry to convert continuous
analog signals to digital codes (parallel or series) via quantization operation. A digital signal processor (DSP)
can be used in analog control systems provided it is equipped with DAC and ADC, as nearly all DSPs are in the
world market.
The digital code can be presented in series and/or parallel or combined formats. A series digital code is a
pulse-train. The digital number counted is the number of pulses in a certain sampling interval, i.e.:
N ¼ f T
where N is the digital number counted, f is the frequency of the pulse-train, and T is the sampling interval.
A parallel digital code is an 8-bit binary code. The digital number counted is an 8-bit binary number from
the least signiﬁcant bit (LSB) to the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB), which corresponds to 0 ¼ (00000000)B to
255 ¼ (11111111)B. Some digital numbers are counted by hexadecimal numbers, which correspond to
0 ¼ (00)H to 255 ¼ (FF)H. In recent decades, most digital codes take parallel format. In the further
description, the digital code usually takes parallel format if not speciﬁcally stating series format. The analog
signal is usually arranged in the full scale 0 to 10 V (particularly, 9.961 V). The resolution of the
corresponding analog signals is better than 0.4% (e.g., 39 mV) for taking parallel digital code. This is
sufﬁciently high accuracy for military and industrial applications. For the D/A and A/D converters with 8-bit
binary digital code, the corresponding digital resolution is 1 LSB (or 1/255) and the analog resolution is
0.039 V (full scale 10 V).
11-1

Quantization is the clue of D/A and A/D conversion procession. For example, an ADC uniquely represents
all analog inputs within the range by a limited number of digital output codes. An ideal transfer function of an
ADC is shown in Figure 11.1. The continuous input analog value is quantized into the discrete analog values
with the increment 0.039 V. Since the analog scale is continuous, while the digital codes are discrete, there is a
quantization process that introduces an error. As the number of discrete codes increases, the corresponding
step width increases and the transfer function approaches an ideal straight line. The steps are designed to have
transitions such that the midpoint of each step corresponds to the point on this ideal line. The width of one
step is deﬁned as 1 LSB, and this is often used as the reference unit for other quantities in the speciﬁcation.
Ideal DACs and ADCs have the best quality with highly accurate resolution, quick sampling rate, high
conversion speed, and good linearity. They are used for general description to simplify analysis of the
fundamental characteristics. Real DACs and ADCs unavoidably have various errors: limited resolution, certain
sampling rate, and conversion speed. Error and resolution are the important technical features of all DACs and
ADCs. Modern DSPs use a 16 bit or 32 bit central processing unit (CPU); but DSP still has DACs and ADCs
with the 8-bit binary digital code. Considering the errors and resolution, this determination is reasonable.
Real DACs and ADCs are unavoidably affected by noise, which is an important technical feature of DAC and
ADC operation. Conversion speed is another technical feature of DACs and ADCs. All factors will be analyzed
in Section 11.4.

D/A and A/D Circuits
Fang Lin Luo, Hong Ye, and Susan A.R. Garrod
D/A conversion is the process of converting digital codes into a continuous range of analog signals.
A/D conversion is the complementary process of converting a continuous range of analog signals into digital
codes. Such conversion processes are necessary to interface real-world systems, which typically monitor
continuously varying analog signals with digital systems that process, store, interpret, and manipulate the
analog values.

D/A and A/D applications have evolved from predominately military-driven applications to consumer-
oriented applications. Up to the mid-1980s, the military applications determined the design of many D/A and
A/D devices. They required very high performance coupled with hermetic packaging, radiation hardening, shock
and vibration testing, and military speciﬁcation and record keeping. Cost was of little concern, and ‘‘low-power’’
applications required approximately 2.8 W. The major applications up to the mid-1980s included military radar
warning and guidance systems, digital oscilloscopes, medical imaging, infrared systems, and professional video.
The applications requiring D/A and A/D circuits in the 1990s have different performance criteria from those
of earlier years. In particular, low-power and high-speed applications are driving the development of D/A and
A/D circuits as the devices are used extensively in battery-operated consumer products. The predominant
applications include cellular telephones, handheld camcorders, portable computers, and set-top cable TV
boxes. These applications generally have low power and long battery life requirements, and they may have
high-speed and high-resolution requirements, as is the case with the set-top cable TV boxes.
DAC is the fundamental circuitry; its successive output values are illustrated in Table 11.1.
Atypical DAC circuit is shown in Figure 11.2. The digital input data are from the digital code with 8-bit parallel
format, the control input is from DSP itself, and the output analog voltage is the ﬁnal value of the DAC.
There are ﬁve typical A/D converters:
. Counting ADC
. Successive approximation ADC
. Dual slope ADC
. Parallel (ﬂash) ADC
. Sigma-delta ADC
Some A/D converters, such as the counting ADC and successive approximation ADC, can be constructed by
using D/A converters. One sample circuit of each typical A/D converter is illustrated in the following ﬁgures
for reference:
. A simple counting ADC is shown in Figure 11.3.
. A successive approximation ADC is shown in Figure 11.4.
. A dual-slope integrating ADC is shown in Figure 11.5.
. A parallel (ﬂash) ADC is shown in Figure 11.6.
. A sigma-delta ADC (3-bit circuitry) is shown in Figure 11.7.
D/A and A/D conversion circuits are available as integrated circuits (ICs) from many manufacturers. A huge
array of ICs exists, consisting of not only the D/A or A/D conversion circuits, but also closely related circuits
such as sample-and-hold ampliﬁers, analog multiplexers, voltage-to-frequency and frequency-to-voltage

DAC and ADC Performance Criteria
Susan A.R. Garrod, Fang Lin Luo, and Hong Ye
The major factors that determine the quality of performance of DACs and ADCs are resolution, sampling rate,
conversion speed, and linearity (errors).
The resolution of a D/A circuit is the smallest change in the output analog signal. In an A/D system, the
resolution is the smallest change in voltage that can be detected by the system and that can produce a change
in the digital code. The resolution determines the total number of digital codes or quantization levels that will
be recognized or produced by the circuit.
The resolution of a D/A or A/D IC is usually speciﬁed in terms of the bits in the digital code or in terms of
the LSB of the system. An n-bit code allows for 2n quantization levels or 2n – 1 steps between quantization
levels. As the number of bits increases, the step size between quantization levels decreases, therefore increasing
the accuracy of the system when a conversion is made between an analog and a digital signal. The system
resolution can be speciﬁed also as the voltage step size between quantization levels. For A/D circuits, the
resolution is the smallest input voltage that is detected by the system.
The conversion speed of a DAC or ADC is determined by the time it takes to perform the conversion
process. For DACs, the speed is speciﬁed as the settling time. For ADCs, the speed is speciﬁed as the conversion
time. The settling time for DACs will vary with supply voltage and transition in the digital code; thus, it is
speciﬁed in the data sheet with the appropriate conditions stated.
ADCs have a maximum sampling rate that limits the speed at which they can perform continuous
conversions. The sampling rate is the number of times per second that the analog signal can be sampled and
converted into a digital code. For proper A/D conversion, the minimum sampling rate must be at least two
times the highest frequency of the analog signal being sampled to satisfy the Nyquist sampling criterion. The
conversion speed and other timing factors must be taken into consideration to determine the maximum

sampling rate of an ADC. Nyquist ADCs use a sampling rate that is slightly more than twice the highest
frequency in the analog signal. Oversampling ADCs use sampling rates of N times this rate, where N typically
ranges from 2 to 64.
Both DACs and ADCs require a voltage reference in order to achieve absolute conversion accuracy. Some
conversion ICs have internal voltage references, while others accept external voltage references. For high-
performance systems, an external precision reference is needed to ensure long-term stability, load regulation,
and control over temperature ﬂuctuations. External precision voltage reference ICs can be found in
manufacturers’ data books.
Measurements accuracy is speciﬁed by the converter’s linearity. Integral linearity is a measure of linearity
over the entire conversion range. It is often deﬁned as the deviation from a straight line drawn between the
endpoints and through zero (or the offset value) of the conversion range. Integral linearity is also referred to as
relative accuracy. The offset value is the reference level required to establish the zero or midpoint of the
conversion range. Differential linearity is the linearity between code transitions and is a measure of the
monotonicity of the converter. A converter is said to be monotonic if increasing input values result in
increasing output values.
The accuracy and linearity values of a converter are speciﬁed in the data sheet in units of the LSB of the
code. The linearity can vary with temperature, so the values are often speciﬁed at +25–C as well as over the
entire temperature range of the device. The working environment temperature range is
. A version in 0–C to +70–C
. B version in 25–C to +85–C
. Storage temperature range in 25–C to +125–C
11.4
Errors, Resolution, Noises, and Conversion Speed
Fang Lin Luo and Hong Ye
The linearity (errors), resolution, noise, and conversion speed are main factors in determining the quality of
performance of DACs and ADCs.
Errors
There are ﬁve main errors considered below and combining them together, we call them the absolute accuracy
error or total error:
1. Quantization error
2. Offset error
3. Gain error
4. Differential nonlinearity error
5. Integral nonlinearity error
Generally, quantization error is ^1 LSB, offset error is up to 1¼ LSB, gain error is 3/4 to 11/2 LSB,
differential nonlinearity error is ^ 1/2 LSB, and integral nonlinearity error is 1/4 to 11/2 LSB. Usually the
total error is 1¼ LSB.
Some errors are usually ignored since they are usually smaller than ^1/4 LSB. They are the aperture error,
sampling error, and ﬁltering error.
Resolution and Accuracy
From the above analysis, the resolution and accuracy can be considered ^1 LSB in digital code and ^0.039 V
in analog signal.
11-7
D/A and A/D Converters

Noises
There are three main noises considered below:
1. Quantization noise
2. Thermal noise
3. Sampling (switching) noise
The quantization noise is calculated as:

Finally:
SNR ¼ 6:02N þ 1:76 dB
ð11:3Þ
The thermal noise happens randomly, and its average value is zero.
The sampling (switching) noise happens periodically, and its average value is zero.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is used to describe the effect of the noises on ADC and DAC. It is usually in
the range 50 dB to 150 dB. For example, the ADC4320, ADC4322, and ADC4325 are complete 16 bit, 1 MHz,
2 MHz, and 500 kHz. Their typical SNR is 91 dB.
Conversion Speed
Conversion speed mainly relies on the sampling frequency and characteristics of the CPU used in the DSP.
Updated DSPs have a sampling frequency in the range 500 kHz to 5 MHz, and the corresponding conversion
speed is in hundreds of nanoseconds. For example, the conversion speed of ADC4322 is 300 ns.
11.5
D/A Conversion Processes and DAC ICs
Susan A.R. Garrod, Fang Lin Luo, and Hong Ye
Using previous analysis, D/A conversion processes and DAC ICs are described in detail in this section.
D/A Conversion Processes
Digital codes in parallel 8-bit binary format are typically converted to analog voltages by assigning a voltage
weight to each bit in the digital code and then summing the voltage weights of the entire code. A general DAC
consists of a network of precision resistors, input switches, and level shifters to activate the switches to convert
a digital code to an analog current or voltage. D/A ICs that produce an analog current output usually have a
faster settling time and better linearity than those that produce a voltage output. When the output current is
available, the designer can convert this to a voltage through the selection of an appropriate output ampliﬁer to
achieve the necessary response speed for the given application.
DACs commonly have a ﬁxed or variable reference level. The reference level, which determines the switching
threshold of the precision switches that form a controlled impedance network, which in turn controls the
value of the output signal. Fixed reference DACs produce an output signal that is proportional to the digital
input. Multiplying DACs produces an output signal that is proportional to the product of a varying reference
level times a digital code.
DACs can produce bipolar, positive, or negative polarity analog signals. A four-quadrant multiplying DAC
allows the reference signal and the value of the binary code to have a positive or negative polarity. The four-
quadrant multiplying DAC produces bipolar output signals.
11-8

DAC ICs
Most DACs are designed for general purpose control applications. Some DACs, however, are designed for
special applications, such as video or graphic outputs, high-deﬁnition video displays, ultra high-speed signal
processing, digital video tape recording, digital attenuators, or high-speed function generators.
DAC ICs often include special features that enable them to be interfaced easily to microprocessors or other
systems. Microprocessor control inputs, input latches, buffers, input registers, and compatibility to standard
logic families are features that are readily available in DAC ICs. In addition, the ICs usually have laser-trimmed
precision resistors to eliminate the need for user trimming to achieve full-scale performance.
11.6
A/D Conversion Processes and ADC ICs
Susan A.R. Garrod, Fang Lin Luo, and Hong Ye
D/A conversion processes and DAC ICs are described in detail in this section.
A/D Conversion Processes
Analog signals can be converted to digital codes by many methods, including integration, successive
approximation, parallel (ﬂash) conversion, delta modulation, pulse code modulation, and sigma-delta
conversion. Two of the most common A/D conversion processes are successive approximation A/D
conversion and parallel or ﬂash A/D conversion. Very high-resolution digital audio or video systems require
specialized A/D techniques that often incorporate one of these general techniques as well as specialized A/D
conversion processes. Examples of specialized A/D conversion techniques are pulse code modulation (PCM)
and sigma-delta conversion. PCM is a common voice-encoding scheme used not only by the audio industry
in digital audio recordings but also by the telecommunications industry for voice encoding and
multiplexing. Sigma-delta conversion is an oversampling A/D conversion where signals are sampled at very
high frequencies. It has very high resolution and low distortion and is being used in the digital audio
recording industry.
Successive approximation A/D conversion is a technique that is commonly used in medium- to high-speed
data acquisition applications. It is one of the fastest A/D conversion techniques that require a minimum
amount of circuitry. The conversion times for successive approximation A/D conversion typically range from
10 to 300 msec for 8-bit systems.
The successive approximation ADC can approximate the analog signal to form an n-bit digital code in n
steps. The successive approximation register (SAR) individually compares an analog input voltage to the
midpoint of one of n ranges to determine the value of 1 bit. This process is repeated a total of n times, using
n ranges, to determine the n bits in the code. The comparison is accomplished as follows: The SAR
determines if the analog input is above or below the midpoint and sets the bit of the digital code
accordingly. The SAR assigns the bits beginning with the most signiﬁcant bit. The bit is set to 1 if the analog
input is greater than the midpoint voltage, or it is set to 0 if it is less than the midpoint voltage. The SAR
then moves to the next bit and sets it to 1 or 0 based on the results of comparing the analog input with the
midpoint of the next allowed range. Because the SAR must perform one approximation for each bit in the
digital code, an n-bit code requires n approximations. A successive approximation ADC consists of four
functional blocks, as shown in Figure 11.4: the SAR, the analog comparator, a DAC, and a clock.
Parallel or ﬂash A/D conversion is used in high-speed applications such as video signal processing,
medical imaging, and radar detection systems. A ﬂash ADC simultaneously compares the input analog voltage
to 2n – 1 threshold voltages to produce an n-bit digital code representing the analog voltage. Typical ﬂash
ADCs with 8-bit resolution operate at 20 to 100 MHz.
The functional block diagram of a ﬂash ADC is shown in Figure 11.6. The circuitry consists of a precision
resistor ladder network, 2n – 1 analog comparators, and a digital priority encoder. The resistor network
establishes threshold voltages for each allowed quantization level. The analog comparators indicate whether or
11-9
D/A and A/D Converters

not the input analog voltage is above or below the threshold at each level. The output of the analog
comparators is input to the digital priority encoder. The priority encoder produces the ﬁnal digital output
code that is stored in an output latch.
An 8-bit ﬂash ADC requires 255 comparators. The cost of high-resolution A/D comparators escalates as the
circuit complexity increases and as the number of analog converters rises by 2n – 1. As a low-cost alternative,
some manufacturers produce modiﬁed ﬂash ADCs that perform the A/D conversion in two steps to reduce the
amount of circuitry required. These modiﬁed ﬂash ADCs are also referred to as half-ﬂash ADCs, since they
perform only half of the conversion simultaneously.
ADC ICs
ADC ICs can be classiﬁed as general purpose, high-speed, ﬂash, and sampling ADCs. The general purpose
ADCs are typically low speed and low cost, with conversion times ranging from 2 ms to 33 ms. A/D
conversion techniques used by these devices typically include successive approximation, tracking, and
integrating. The general purpose ADCs often have control signals for simpliﬁed microprocessor interfacing.
These ICs are appropriate for many process control, industrial, and instrumentation applications, as well as for
environmental monitoring such as seismology, oceanography, meteorology, and pollution monitoring.
High-speed ADCs have conversion times typically ranging from 300 ns to 3 ms. The higher speed
performance of these devices is achieved by using the successive approximation technique, modiﬁed ﬂash
techniques, and statistically derived A/D conversion techniques. Applications appropriate for these A/D ICs
include fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, radar digitization, medical instrumentation, and multiplexed
data acquisition. Some ICs have been manufactured with an extremely high degree of linearity to be
appropriate for specialized applications in digital spectrum analysis, vibration analysis, geological research,
sonar digitizing, and medical imaging.
Flash ADCs have conversion times ranging typically from 10 to 50 nsec. Flash A/D conversion techniques
enable these ICs to be used in many specialized high-speed data acquisition applications such as TV video
digitizing (encoding), radar analysis, transient analysis, high-speed digital oscilloscopes, medical ultrasound
imaging, high-energy physics, and robotic vision applications.
Sampling ADCs have a sample-and-hold ampliﬁer circuit built into the IC, eliminating the need for an
external one. The throughput of these ADCs ICs ranges typically from 35 kHz to 100 MHz. The speed of the
system is dependent on the A/D technique used by the sampling ADC.
ADC ICs produce digital codes in a serial or parallel format, and some ICs offer the designer both formats.
The digital outputs are compatible with standard logic families to facilitate interfacing to other digital systems.
In addition, some ADC ICs have a built-in analog multiplexer and therefore can accept more than one analog
input signal.
Pulse code modulation (PCM) ICs are high-precision ADCs. The PCM IC is often referred to as a PCM
codec with encoder and decoder functions. The encoder portion of the codec performs the A/D conversion,
and the decoder portion of the codec performs the D/A conversion. The digital code is usually formatted as a
serial data stream for ease of interfacing to digital transmission and multiplexing systems.
PCM is a technique where an analog signal is sampled, quantized, and then encoded as a digital word. The
PCM IC can include successive approximation techniques or other techniques to accomplish the PCM
encoding. In addition, the PCM codec can employ nonlinear data compression techniques such as
companding if it is necessary to minimize the number of bits in the output digital code. Companding is a
logarithmic technique used to compress a code to fewer bits before transmission. The inverse logarithmic
function is then used to expand the code to its original number of bits before converting it to the analog signal.
Companding is typically used in telecommunications transmission systems to minimize data transmission
rates without degrading the resolution of low-amplitude signals. Two standardized companding techniques are
used extensively: A law and m law. A law companding is used in Europe, whereas m law is used predominantly
in the U.S. and Japan. Linear PCM conversion is used in high-ﬁdelity audio systems to preserve the integrity of
the audio signal throughout the entire analog range.

Digital signal processing (DSP) techniques provide another type of A/D conversion IC. Specialized A/D
conversion such as adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM), sigma-delta modulation, speech
subband encoding, adaptive predictive speech encoding, and speech recognition can be accomplished through
the use of DSP systems. Some DSP systems require analog front ends that employ traditional PCM codec ICs
or DSP interface ICs. These ICs can interface to a digital signal processor for advanced A/D applications. Some
manufacturers have incorporated DSP techniques on board the single-chip A/D IC, as in the case of the
DSP56ACD16 sigma-delta modulation IC by Motorola.
Integrating ADCs are used for conversions that must take place over a long period of time, e.g., digital
voltmeter applications or sensor applications such as thermocouples. The integrating ADC produces a
digital code that represents the average of the signal over time. Noise is reduced by means of the signal
averaging or integration. Dual-slope integration is accomplished by a counter that advances while an
input voltage charges a capacitor in a speciﬁed time interval, T. This is compared to another count
sequence that advances while a reference voltage discharges across the same capacitor in a time
interval, (d T). The ratio d of the charging count value to the discharging count value is proportional to
the ratio of the input voltage to the reference voltage. Hence, the integrating converter provides a digital
code that is a measure of the input voltage averaged over time. The conversion accuracy is independent of
the capacitor and the clock frequency since they affect both the charging and discharging operations. The
charging period, T, is selected to be the period of the fundamental frequency to be rejected. The maximum
conversion rate is slightly less than 1/(2T) conversions per second, making it too slow for high-speed
data acquisition applications, but it is appropriate for long-duration applications of slowly varying
input signals.

Grounding and Bypassing on D/A and A/D ICs
Susan A.R. Garrod, Fang Lin Luo, and Hong Ye
DAC and ADC ICs require correct grounding and capacitive bypassing in order to operate according to
performance speciﬁcations. The digital signals can severely impair analog signals. To combat the
electromagnetic interference induced by the digital signals, the analog and digital grounds should be kept
separate and should have only one common point on the circuit board. If possible, this common point should
be the connection to the power supply.
Bypass capacitors are required at the power connections to the IC, the reference signal inputs, and the
analog inputs to minimize noise that is induced by the digital signals. Each manufacturer speciﬁes the
recommended bypass capacitor locations and values in the data sheet. The 1-mF tantalum capacitors are
commonly recommended, with additional high-frequency power supply decoupling sometimes being
recommended through the use of ceramic disc shunt capacitors. The manufacturer’s recommendations should
be followed to ensure proper performance.
11.8
Selection Criteria for D/A and A/D Converter ICs
Susan A.R. Garrod, Fang Lin Luo, and Hong Ye
Hundreds of DAC and ADC ICs are available, with prices ranging from a few dollars to several hundred dollars
each. The selection of the appropriate type of converter is based on the application requirements of the system,
the performance requirements, and cost. The following issues should be considered in order to select the
appropriate converter:
1. What are the input and output requirements of the system? Specify all signal current and voltage ranges,
logic levels, input and output impedances, digital codes, data rates, and data formats.
2. What level of accuracy is required? Determine the resolution needed throughout the analog voltage
range, the dynamic response, the degree of linearity, and the number of bits encoding.
11-11
D/A and A/D Converters

3. What speed is required? Determine the maximum analog input frequency for sampling in an A/D system,
the number of bits for encoding each analog signal, and the rate of change of input digital codes in a D/A
system.
4. What is the operating environment of the system? Obtain information on the temperature range and
power supply to select a converter that is accurate over the operating range.
Final selection of DAC and ADC ICs should be made by consulting manufacturers to obtain their technical
speciﬁcations for the devices. Major manufacturers of DACs and ADCs include Analog Devices, Burr-Brown,
DATEL, Maxim, National, Phillips Components, Precision Monolithics, Signetics, Sony, Texas Instruments,
Ultra Analog, and Yamaha. Information on contacting these manufacturers and others can be found in an IC
Master Catalog.
Deﬁning Terms
Companding:
A process designed to minimize the transmission bit rate of a signal by compressing it prior
to transmission and expanding it upon reception. It is a rudimentary data compression technique that
requires minimal processing.
Delta modulation:
An A/D conversion process where the digital output code represents the change, or
slope, of the analog input signal rather than the absolute value of the analog input signal. A 1 indicates a
rising slope of the input signal. A 0 indicates a falling slope of the input signal. The sampling rate is
dependent on the derivative of the signal, since a rapidly changing signal would require a rapid sampling
rate for acceptable performance.
Fixed reference DAC: The analog output is proportional to a ﬁxed (nonvarying) reference signal.
Flash A/D:
The fastest A/D conversion process available to date, also referred to as parallel A/D conversion.
The analog signal is simultaneously evaluated by 2n1 comparators to produce an n bit digital code in
one step. Because of the large number of comparators required, the circuitry for ﬂash ADCs can be very
expensive. This technique is commonly used in digital video systems.
Integrating A/D:
The analog input signal is integrated over time to produce a digital signal that represents
the area under the curve, or the integral.
Multiplying D/A:
A D/A conversion process where the output signal is the product of a digital code
multiplied by an analog input reference signal. This allows the analog reference signal to be scaled by a
digital code.
Nyquist A/D converters:
ADCs that sample analog signals having a maximum frequency that is less than
the Nyquist frequency. The Nyquist frequency is deﬁned as one-half of the sampling frequency. If a
signal has frequencies above the Nyquist frequency, a distortion called aliasing occurs. To prevent this,
an antialiasing ﬁlter with a ﬂat passband and very sharp roll-off is required.
Oversampling converters:
ADCs that sample frequencies at a rate much higher than the Nyquist
frequency. Typical oversampling rates are 32 and 64 times the sampling rate that would be required with
the Nyquist converters.
Pulse code modulation (PCM):
An A/D conversion process requiring three steps: the analog signal is
sampled, quantized, and encoded into a ﬁxed length digital code. This technique is used in many digital
voice and audio systems. The reverse process reconstructs an analog signal from the PCM code. The
operation is very similar to other A/D techniques, but speciﬁc PCM circuits are optimized for the
particular voice or audio application.
Sigma-delta A/D conversion:
An oversampling A/D conversion process where the analog signal is
sampled at rates much higher (typically 64 times) than the sampling rates that would be required
with a Nyquist converter. Sigma-delta modulators integrate the analog signal before performing the
delta modulation. The integral of the analog signal is encoded rather than the change in the
analog signal, as is the case for traditional delta modulation. A digital sample rate reduction ﬁlter
(also called a digital decimation ﬁlter) is used to provide an output sampling rate at twice the
11-12
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Nyquist frequency of the signal. The overall result of oversampling and digital sample rate
reduction is greater resolution and less distortion compared to a Nyquist converter process.
Successive approximation:
An A/D conversion process that systematically evaluates the analog signal in n
steps to produce an n-bit digital code. The analog signal is successively compared to determine the
digital code, beginning with the determination of the most signiﬁcant bit of the code.

Introduction
The ﬁeld of design automation (DA) technology, also commonly called computer-aided design (CAD) or
computer-aided engineering (CAE), involves developing computer programs to conduct portions of product
design and manufacturing on behalf of the designer. Competitive pressures to produce more efﬁciently new
generations of products having improved function and performance are motivating the growing importance of
DA. The increasing complexities of microelectronic technology, shown in Figure 12.1, illustrate the importance
of relegating portions of product development to computer automation (Barbe, 1980).
Advances in microelectronic technology enable over 1 million devices to be manufactured on an integrated
circuit that is smaller than a postage stamp; yet the ability to exploit this capability remains a challenge.
Manual design techniques are unable to keep pace with product design cycle demands and are being replaced
by automated design techniques (Saprio, 1986; Dillinger, 1988).
Figure 12.2 summarizes the historical development of DA technology. DA computer programs are often
simply called applications or tools. DA efforts started in the early 1960s as academic research projects and
captive industrial programs; these efforts focused on tools for physical and logical design. Followon
developments extended logic simulation to more-detailed circuit and device simulation and more-abstract
functional simulation. Starting in the mid to late 1970s, new areas of test and synthesis emerged and vendors
started offering commercial DA products. Today, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry is an
international business with a well-established and expanding technical base (Trimberger, 1990). EDA will be
examined by presenting an overview of the following areas:
. Design entry
. Synthesis
12-1

. Veriﬁcation
. Physical design
. Test
12.2
Design Entry
Design entry, also called design capture, is the process of communicating with a DA system. In short, design
entry is how an engineer ‘‘talks’’ to a DA application and/or system.
Any sort of communication is composed of two elements: language and mechanism. Language provides
common semantics; mechanism provides a means by which to convey the common semantics. For example,
people communicate via a language, such as English or German, and a mechanism, such as a telephone or
electronic mail. For design, a digital system can be described in many ways, involving different perspectives or
abstractions. An abstraction deﬁnes at a particular level of detail the behavior or semantics of a digital system,
i.e., how the outputs respond to the inputs. Figure 12.3 illustrates several popular levels of abstractions.
Moving from the lower left to the upper right, the level of abstraction generally increases, meaning that
physical models are the most detailed and speciﬁcation models are the least detailed. The trend toward higher
levels of design entry abstraction supports the need to address greater levels of complexity (Peterson, 1981).

The physical level of abstraction involves geometric information
that deﬁnes electrical devices and their interconnection. Geometric
information includes the shape of objects and how objects are
placed relative to each other. For example, Figure 12.4 shows the
geometric shapes deﬁning a simple complementary metaloxide
semiconductor (CMOS) inverter. The shapes denote different
materials, such as aluminum and polysilicon, and connections,
called contacts or vias.
Design entry mechanisms for physical information involve
textual and graphical techniques. With textual techniques, geo-
metric shape and placement are described via an artwork
description language, such as Caltech Intermediate Form (CIF) or Electronic Design Intermediate Form
(EDIF). With graphical techniques, geometric shape and placement are described by rendering the objects on
a display terminal.
The electrical level abstracts physical information into corresponding electrical devices, such as capacitors,
transistors, and resistors. Electrical information includes device behavior in terms of terminal current and
voltage relationships. Device behavior may also be deﬁned in terms of manufacturing parameters. Figure 12.5
shows the electrical symbols denoting a CMOS inverter.
The logical level abstracts electrical information into corresponding logical elements, such as and gates, or
gates, and inverters. Logical information includes truth table and/or characteristic-switching algebra equations
and active-level designations. Figure 12.6 shows the logical symbol for a CMOS inverter. Notice how the
amount of information decreases as the level of abstraction increases.
Design entry mechanisms for electrical and logical abstractions are collectively called schematic capture
techniques. Schematic capture deﬁnes hierarchical structures, commonly called netlists, of components.

Digital and Analog Electronic Design Automation

A designer creates instances of components supplied from a library of predeﬁned components and connects
component pins or ports via wires (Douglas-Young, 1988; Pechet, 1991).
The functional level abstracts logical elements into corresponding computational units, such as registers,
multiplexers, and arithmetic logic units (ALUs). The architectural level abstracts functional information into
computational algorithms or paradigms. Examples of common computational paradigms are listed below:
. State diagrams
. Petri nets
. Control/data ﬂow graphs
. Function tables
. Spreadsheets
. Binary decision diagrams
These higher levels of abstraction support a more expressive, ‘‘higher-bandwidth’’ communication interface
between engineers and DA programs. Engineers can focus their creative, cognitive skills on concept and
behavior, rather than on the complexities of detailed implementation. Associated design entry mechanisms
typically use hardware description languages with a combination of textual and graphic techniques (Birtwistle
and Subrahmanyan, 1988).
Figure 12.7 shows an example of a simple state diagram. The state diagram deﬁnes three states, denoted by
circles. State-to-state transitions are denoted by labeled arcs; state transitions depend on the present state and
the input X. The output, Z, per state is given within each state. Since the output is dependent on only the
present state, the digital system is classiﬁed as a Moore ﬁnite state machine. If the output is dependent on the
present state and input, then the digital system is classiﬁed as a Mealy ﬁnite state machine.
A hardware description language model written in VHDL of the Moore ﬁnite state machine is given in
Figure 12.8. The VHDL model, called a design entity, uses a ‘‘data ﬂow’’ description style to describe the state
machine (Dewey, 1983, 1992, 1997). The entity statement deﬁnes the interface, i.e., the ports. The ports
include two input signals, X and CLK, and an output signal Z. The ports are of type BIT, which speciﬁes that
FIGURE 12.7
State diagram.
FIGURE 12.6
Logical abstraction.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

the signals may only carry the values 0 or 1. The architecture statement deﬁnes the input/output transform via
two concurrent signal assignment statements. The internal signal STATE holds the ﬁnite state information and
is driven by a guarded, conditional concurrent signal assignment statement that executes when the associated
block expression:
ðCLK ¼
; 1
; and not CLK
;STABLEÞ
is true, which is only on the rising edge of the signal CLK. STABLE is a predeﬁned attribute of the signal CLK;
CLK’STABLE is true if CLK has not changed value. Thus, if ‘‘not CLK’STABLE’’ is true, meaning that CLK
has just changed value, and ‘‘CLK¼’1’,’’ then a rising transition has occurred on CLK. The output signal Z is
driven by a nonguarded, selected concurrent signal assignment statement that executes any time STATE
changes value.
12.3
Synthesis
Figure 12.9 shows that the synthesis task generally follows
the design entry task. After describing the desired system via
design entry, synthesis DA programs are invoked to assist
generating the required detailed design.
Synthesis translates or transforms a design from one level of
abstraction to another, more detailed level of abstraction. The
more detailed level of abstraction may be only an intermediate
step in the entire design process, or it may be the ﬁnal
implementation. Synthesis programs that yield a ﬁnal
implementation are sometimes called silicon compilers
because the programs generate sufﬁcient detail to proceed
directly to silicon fabrication (Ayres, 1983; Gajski, 1988).
FIGURE 12.8
VHDL model.
FIGURE 12.9
Design process synthesis.
12-5
Digital and Analog Electronic Design Automation

Like design abstractions, synthesis techniques can be hierarchically categorized, as shown in Figure 12.10.
The higher levels of synthesis offer the advantage of less complexity, but also the disadvantage of less control
over the ﬁnal design.
Algorithmic synthesis, also called behavioral synthesis, addresses ‘‘multicycle’’ behavior, which means
behavior that spans more than one control step. A control step equates to a clock cycle of a synchronous,
sequential digital system, i.e., a state in a ﬁnite-state machine controller or a microprogram step in a micro-
programmed controller. Algorithmic synthesis typically accepts sequential design descriptions that deﬁne an
input/output transform, but provide little information about the parallelism of the ﬁnal design (Camposano
and Wolfe, 1991; Gajski et al., 1992).
Partitioning decomposes the design description into smaller behaviors. Partitioning is an example of a
high-level transformation. High-level transformations include common software programming compiler
optimizations, such as loop unrolling, subprogram in-line expansion, constant propagation, and common
subexpression elimination.
Resource allocation associates behaviors with hardware computational units, and scheduling determines the
order in which behaviors execute. Behaviors that are mutually exclusive can potentially share computational
resources. Allocation is performed using a variety of graph clique covering or node coloring algorithms.
Allocation and scheduling are interdependent, and different synthesis strategies perform allocation and sched-
uling different ways. Sometimes scheduling is performed ﬁrst, followed by allocation; sometimes allocation is
performed ﬁrst, followed by scheduling; and sometimes allocation and scheduling are interleaved.
Scheduling assigns computational units to control steps, thereby determining which behaviors execute in
which clock cycles. At one extreme, all computational units can be assigned to a single control step, exploiting
maximum concurrency. At the other extreme, computational units can be assigned to individual control steps,
exploiting maximum sequentiality. Several popular scheduling algorithms are listed below:
. As-soon-as-possible (ASAP)
. As-late-as-possible (ALAP)
. List scheduling
. Force-directed scheduling
. Control step splitting/merging
ASAP and ALAP scheduling algorithms order computational units based on data dependencies. List
scheduling is based on ASAP and ALAP scheduling, but considers additional, more-global constraints, such as
maximum number of control steps. Force-directed scheduling computes the probabilities of computational
units being assigned to control steps and attempts to evenly distribute computation activity among all control
steps. Control step splitting starts with all computational units assigned to one control step and generates
FIGURE 12.10
Taxonomy of synthesis techniques.
12-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

a schedule by splitting the computational units into multiple control steps. Control step merging starts with all
computational units assigned to individual control steps and generates a schedule by merging or combining
units and steps (Paulin and Knight, 1989; Camposano and Wolfe, 1991).
Register transfer synthesis takes as input the results of algorithmic synthesis and addresses ‘‘per-cycle’’
behavior, which means the behavior during one clock cycle. Register transfer synthesis selects logic to realize
the hardware computational units generated during algorithmic synthesis, such as realizing an addition
operation with a carry–save adder or realizing addition and subtraction operations with an arithmetic logic
unit. Data that must be retained across multiple clock cycles are identiﬁed, and registers are allocated to hold
the data. Finally, ﬁnite-state machine synthesis involves state minimization and state assignment. State
minimization seeks to eliminate redundant or equivalent states, and state assignment assigns binary encodings
for states to minimize combinational logic (Brayton et al., 1992; Sasao, 1993).
Logic synthesis optimizes the logic generated by register transfer synthesis and maps the optimized logic
operations onto physical gates supported by the target fabrication technology. Technology mapping considers
the foundry cell library and associated electrical restrictions, such as fan-in/fan-out limitations.
12.4
Veriﬁcation
Figure 12.11 shows that the veriﬁcation task generally follows the synthesis task. The veriﬁcation task
checks the correctness of the function and performance of a design to ensure that an intermediate or
ﬁnal design faithfully realizes the initial, desired speciﬁcation. Three major types of veriﬁcation are listed
below:
. Timing analysis
. Simulation
. Emulation
Timing Analysis
Timing analysis checks that the overall design satisﬁes
operating speed requirements and that individual
signals within a design satisfy transition requirements.
Common signal transition requirements, also called
timing hazards, include rise and fall times, propagation
delays, clock periods, race conditions, glitch detection,
and setup and hold times. For instance, setup and hold
times specify relationships between data and control
signals to ensure that memory devices (level-sensitive
latches or edge-sensitive ﬂip-ﬂops) correctly and
reliably store desired data. The data signal carrying the
information to be stored in the memory device must
be stable for a period equal to the setup time prior to
the control signal transition to ensure that the correct
value is sensed by the memory device. Also, the data signal must be stable for a period equal to the hold time
after the control signal transition to ensure that the memory device has enough time to store the sensed value.
Another class of timing transition requirements, commonly called signal integrity checks, include reﬂections,
crosstalk, ground bounce, and electromagnetic interference. Signal integrity checks are typically required for
high-speed designs operating at clock frequencies above 75 MHz. At such high frequencies, the transmission
line behavior of wires must be analyzed. A wire should be properly terminated, i.e., connected, to a port having
an impedance matching the wire characteristic impedance to prevent signal reﬂections. Signal reﬂections are
portions of an emanating signal that ‘‘bounce back’’ from the destination to the source. Signal reﬂections
reduce the power of the emanating signal and can damage the source. Crosstalk refers to unwanted reactive
coupling between physically adjacent signals, providing a connection between signals that are supposed to be
FIGURE 12.11
Design process veriﬁcation.

Digital and Analog Electronic Design Automation

electrically isolated. Ground bounce is another signal integrity problem. Since all conductive material has a
ﬁnite impedance, a ground signal network does not in practice offer the exact same electrical potential
throughout an entire design. These potential differences are usually negligible because the distributive
impedance of the ground signal network is small compared with other ﬁnite-component impedances. However,
when many signals switch value simultaneously, a substantial current can ﬂow through the ground signal
network. High intermittent currents yield proportionately high intermittent potential drops, i.e., ground
bounces, which can cause unwanted circuit behavior. Finally, electromagnetic interference refers to signal
harmonics radiating from design components and interconnects. This harmonic radiation may interfere with
other electronic equipment or may exceed applicable environmental safety regulatory limits (McHaney, 1991).
Timing analysis can be performed dynamically or statically. Dynamic timing analysis exercises the design via
simulation or emulation for a period of time with a set of input stimuli and records the timing behavior. Static
timing analysis does not exercise the design via simulation or emulation. Rather, static analysis records timing
behavior based on the timing behavior, e.g., propagation delay, of the design components and their
interconnection.
Static timing analysis techniques are primarily block oriented or path oriented. Block-oriented timing
analysis generates design input (also called primary input) to design output (also called primary output), and
propagation delays by analyzing the design ‘‘stage-by-stage’’ and by summing up the individual stage delays.
All devices driven by primary inputs constitute stage 1, all devices driven by the outputs of stage 1 constitute
stage 2, and so on. Starting with the ﬁrst stage, all devices associated with a stage are annotated with worst-
case delays. A worst-case delay is the propagation delay of the device plus the delay of the last input to arrive at
the device, i.e., the signal path with the longest delay leading up to the device inputs. For example, the device
labeled ‘‘H’’ in stage 3 in Figure 12.12 is annotated with the worst-case delay of 13, representing the device
propagation delay of 4 and the delay of the last input to arrive through devices ‘‘B’’ and ‘‘C’’ of 9 (McWilliams
and Widdoes, 1978). When the devices associated with the last stage, i.e., the devices driving the primary
outputs, are processed, the accumulated worst-case delays record the longest delay from primary inputs to
primary outputs, also call the critical paths. The critical path for each primary output is highlighted in
Figure 12.12.
Path-oriented timing analysis generates primary input to primary output propagation delays by traversing
all possible signal paths one at a time. Thus, ﬁnding the critical path via path-oriented timing analysis is
equivalent to ﬁnding the longest path through a directed acyclic graph, where devices are graph vertices and
interconnections are graph edges (Sasiki et al., 1978).
To account for realistic variances in component timing due to manufacturing tolerances, aging, or environ-
mental effects, timing analysis often provides stochastic or statistical checking capabilities. Statistical timing
FIGURE 12.12

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

analysis uses random-number generators based on empirically observed probabilistic distributions to
determine component timing behavior. Thus, statistical timing analysis describes design performance and the
likelihood of the design performance.
Simulation
Simulation exercises a design over a period of time by applying a series of input stimuli and generating the
associated output responses. The general event-driven, also called schedule-driven, simulation algorithm is
diagrammed in Figure 12.13. An event is a change in signal value. Simulation starts by initializing the design;
initial values are assigned to all signals. Initial values include starting values and pending values that constitute
future events. Simulation time is advanced to the next pending event(s), signals are updated, and sensitized
models are evaluated (Pooch, 1993). The process of evaluating the sensitized models yields new, potentially
different, values for signals, i.e., a new set of pending events. These new events are added to the list of pending
events, time is advanced to the next pending event(s), and the simulation algorithm repeats. Each pass through
the loop in Figure 12.13 of evaluating sensitized models at a particular time step is called a simulation cycle.
Simulation ends when the design yields no further activity, i.e., when there are no more pending events to
process.
Logic simulation is computationally intensive for large, complex designs. As an example, consider
simulating 1 sec of a 200K-gate, 20 MHz processor design. By assuming that, on average, only 10% of the total
200K gates are active or sensitized on each processor clock cycle, Equation (12.1) shows that simulating 1 sec
of actual processor time equates to 400 billion events:
400 billion events ¼ ð20 million clock cyclesÞð200K gatesÞð10% activityÞ
140 h ¼ ð400 billion eventsÞ 50 instructions

 50 million instructions

ð12:1Þ
Assuming that, on average, a simulation program executes 50 computer instructions per event on a computer
capable of processing 50 million instructions per second (MIP), Equation (12.1) also shows that processing
400 billion events requires 140 h or just short of 6 days. Figure 12.14 shows how simulation computation
generally scales with design complexity.
To address the growing computational demands of simulation, several simulation acceleration techniques
have been introduced. Schedule-driven simulation, explained above, can be accelerated by removing layers of
interpretation and running a simulation as a native executable image; such an approach is called complied,
scheduled-driven simulation.
FIGURE 12.13

Digital and Analog Electronic Design Automation

As an alternative to schedule-driven simulation, cycle-driven simulation avoids the overhead of event queue
processing by evaluating all devices at regular intervals of time. Cycle-driven simulation is efﬁcient when a
design exhibits a high degree of concurrency, i.e., when a large percentage of the devices are active per
simulation cycle. Based on the staging of devices, devices are rank-ordered to determine the order in which
they are evaluated at each time step to ensure the correct causal behavior yielding the proper ordering of
events. For functional veriﬁcation, logic devices are often assigned zero-delay and memory devices are assigned
unit-delay. Thus, any number of stages of logic devices may execute between system clock periods.
In another simulation acceleration technique, message-driven simulation, also called parallel or distributed
simulation, device execution is divided among several processors and the device simulations communicate
event activity via messages. Messages are communicated using conservative or optimistic strategies. Optimistic
message-passing strategies, such as time warp and lazy cancellation, make assumptions about future event
activity to advance local device simulation. If the assumptions are correct, the processors operate more
independently and better exploit parallel computation. However, if the assumptions are incorrect, then local
device simulations may be forced to ‘‘roll back’’ to synchronize local device simulations (Bryant, 1979; Chandy
and Misra, 1981).
Schedule-driven, cycle-driven, and message-driven simulations are software-based simulation acceleration
techniques. Simulation can also be accelerated by relegating certain simulation activities to dedicated
hardware. For example, hardware modelers can be attached to software simulators to accelerate the activity of
device evaluation. As the name implies, hardware modeling uses actual hardware devices instead of software
models to obtain stimulus/response information. Using actual hardware devices reduces the expense of
generating and maintaining software models and provides an environment to support application software
development. However, it is sometimes difﬁcult for a slave hardware modeler to preserve accurate real-time
device operating response characteristics within a master nonreal-time software simulation environment.
For example, some hardware devices may not be able to retain state information between invocations, so the
hardware modeler must save the history of previous inputs and reapply them to bring the hardware device to
the correct state to apply a new input.
Another technique for addressing the growing computational demands of simulation is via simulation
engines. A simulation engine can be viewed as an extension of the simulation acceleration technique of
hardware modeling. With a hardware modeler, the simulation algorithm executes in software and component
evaluation executes in dedicated hardware. With a simulation engine, the simulation algorithm and
component evaluation execute in dedicated hardware. Simulation engines are typically two to three orders of
magnitude faster than software simulation (Takasaki et al., 1989).

Analog Simulation
Analog simulation involves time-domain analyses and frequency-domain analyses, which are generally con-
ducted using some form of direct current(dc) simulation, diagrammed in Figure 12.15. dc simulation determines
the quiescent or steady-state operating point for a circuit, specifying node voltages, branch currents, input/
output resistances, element sensitivities, and input/output gains (Chua and Lin, 1975; Nagel, 1975).
Several popular equation formulation schemes are summarized in Table 12.1. Equation formulation
schemes generate a set of linear equations denoting relationships between circuit voltages and currents; these
relationships are based on the physical principle of the conservation of energy expressed via Kirchoff’s current
law (KCL), Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL), and branch constitutive relationships (BCRs). A circuit having N
nodes and B branches possesses 2B independent variables deﬁning B branch voltages and B branch currents.
These variables are governed by 2B linearly independent equations composed of N–1 KCL equations, B–Nþ1
KVL equations, and B BCR equations (Hachtel et al., 1971; Ho et al., 1975).
Equation-ordering schemes augment equation formulation schemes by reorganizing, modifying, and scaling
the equations to improve the efﬁciency and/or accuracy of the subsequent equation solution scheme. More
speciﬁcally, equation-ordering schemes seek to improve the ‘‘diagonal dominance’’ structure of the coefﬁcient
matrix by maximizing the number of ‘‘off-diagonal’’ zeros. Popular equation-ordering schemes include
pivoting and row ordering (Markowitz) (Zlatev, 1980).
Finally, equation solution schemes determine the values for the independent variables that comply with the
governing equations. There are basically two types of equation solution schemes: explicit and implicit. Explicit
solution schemes, such as Gaussian elimination and/or LU factorization, determine independent variable
values using closed-form, deterministic techniques. Implicit solution schemes, such as Gauss–Jacobi and
Gauss–Seidel, determine independent variable values using iterative, nondeterministic techniques.
Emulation
Emulation, also called computer-aided prototyping, veriﬁes a design by realizing the design in ‘‘preproduction’’
hardware and exercising the hardware. The term preproduction hardware means nonoptimized hardware

providing the correct functional behavior, but not necessarily the correct performance. That is, emulation
hardware may be slower, require more area, or dissipate more power than production hardware. At present,
preproduction hardware commonly involves some form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), typically
ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). PLDs provide generic combinational and sequential digital system
logic that can be programmed to realize a wide variety of designs (Walters, 1991).
Emulation offers the advantage of providing prototype hardware early in the design cycle to check for errors
or inconsistencies in initial functional speciﬁcations. Problems can be isolated and design modiﬁcations can be
easily accommodated by reprogramming the logic devices. Emulation can support functional veriﬁcation at
computational rates much greater than conventional simulation. However, emulation does not generally
support performance veriﬁcation because, as explained above, prototype hardware typically does not operate
at production clock rates.
12.5
Physical Design
Figure 12.16 shows that the physical design task generally follows the veriﬁcation task. Having validated the
function and performance of the detailed design during veriﬁcation, physical design realizes the detailed
design by translating logic into actual hardware. Physical design involves placement, routing, artwork
generation, rules checking, and back annotation (Sait and Youseff, 1995).
Placement transforms a logical hierarchy into a physical hierarchy by deﬁning how hardware elements are
oriented and arranged relative to each other. Placement determines the overall size, i.e., area, a digital system
will occupy. Two popular placement algorithms are mincut and simulated annealing. Mincut placement
techniques group highly connected cells into clusters. Then, the clusters are sorted and arranged according to
user-supplied priorities. Simulated annealing conducts a series of trial-and-error experiments by pseudo-
randomly moving cells and evaluating the resulting placements, again according to user-supplied priorities.
Routing deﬁnes the wires that establish the required port-to-port connections. Routing is often performed in
two stages: global and local. Global routing assigns networks to major wiring regions, called tracks; local routing
deﬁnes the actual wiring for each network within its assigned track. Two common classes of routing algorithms
are channel and maze. Channel routing connects ports abutting the same track. Maze routing, also called switch-
box routing, connects ports abutting different channels. Routing considers a variety of metrics, including timing
skew, wire length, number of vias, and number of jogs (corners) (Spinks, 1985; Preas et al., 1988).
Rules checking veriﬁes that the ﬁnal layout of geometric shapes and their orientation complies with logical,
electrical, and physical constraints. Logical rules verify that the implementation realizes the desired digital
system. Electrical rules verify conformance to loading, noise margins, and fan-in/fan-out connectivity
FIGURE 12.16
Design process—physical design.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

constraints. Finally, physical rules verify conformance to dimensional, spacing, and alignment constraints
(Hollis, 1987).
12.6
Test
Figure 12.17 shows that test follows physical design. After physical design, the digital system is manufactured
and test checks the resulting hardware for correct function and performance. Thus, the primary objective of
test is to detect a faulty device by applying input test stimuli and observing expected results (Buckroyd, 1989;
Weyerer and Goldemund, 1992).
The test task is difﬁcult because designs are growing in complexity; more components provide more
opportunity for manufacturing defects. Test is also challenged by new microelectronic fabrication processes.
These new processes support higher levels of integration that provide fewer access points to probe internal
electrical nodes and new failure modes that provide more opportunity for manufacturing defects.
Fault Modeling
What is a fault? A fault is a manufacturing or aging defect that causes a device to operate incorrectly or to fail.
A sample listing of common integrated circuit physical faults are given below:
. Wiring faults
. Dielectric faults
. Threshold faults
. Soft faults
Wiring faults are unwanted opens and shorts. Two wires or networks that should be electrically connected,
but are not connected constitute an open. Two wires or networks that should not be electrically connected, but
are connected constitute a short. Wiring faults can be caused by manufacturing defects, such as metallization
and etching problems, or aging defects, such as corrosion and electromigration. Dielectric faults are electrical
FIGURE 12.17
Design process—test.
12-13

isolation defects that can be caused by masking defects, chemical impurities, material imperfections, or
electrostatic discharge. Threshold faults occur when the turn-on and turn-off voltage potentials of electrical
devices exceed allowed ranges. Soft faults occur when radiation exposure temporarily changes electrical charge
distributions. Such changes can alter circuit voltage potentials, which can, in turn, change logical values, also
called dropping bits. Radiation effects are called ‘‘soft’’ faults because the hardware is not permanently damaged
(Zobrist, 1993).
To simplify the task of fault testing, the physical faults described above are translated into logical faults.
Typically, a single logical fault covers several physical faults. A popular logical fault model is the single stuck line
(SSL) fault model. The single stuck line fault model supports faults that denote wires permanently set to a
logic 0, ‘‘stuck-at-0,’’ or a logic 1, ‘‘stuck-at-1.’’ Building on the single stuck line fault model, the multiple stuck
line (MSL) fault model supports faults where multiple wires are stuck-at-0/stuck-at-1. Stuck fault models do
not address all physical faults because not all physical faults result in signal lines permanently set to low or high
voltages, i.e., stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1 logic faults. Thus, other fault models have been developed to address
speciﬁc failure mechanisms. For example, the bridging fault model addresses electrical shorts that cause
unwanted coupling or spurious feedback loops.
Fault Testing
Once the physical faults that may cause device malfunction have been identiﬁed and categorized and how the
physical faults relate to logical faults has been determined, the next task is to develop tests to detect these
faults. When the tests are generated by a computer program, this activity is called automatic test program
generation (ATPG). Examples of fault testing techniques are listed below:
. Stuck-at techniques
. Scan techniques
. Signature techniques
. Coding techniques
. Electrical monitoring techniques
Basic stuck-at fault testing techniques address combinational digital systems. Three of the most popular
stuck-at fault testing techniques are the D algorithm, the path-oriented decision making (Podem) algorithm,
and the Fan algorithm. These algorithms ﬁrst identify a circuit fault, e.g., stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1, and then
try to generate an input stimulus that detects the fault and makes the fault visible at an output. Detecting a
fault is called fault sensitization and making a fault visible is called fault propagation. To illustrate this process,
consider the simple combinational design in Figure 12.18 (Goel, 1981; Fujiwara and Shimono, 1983).
The combinational digital design is defective because a manufacturing defect has caused the output of the
top and gate to be permanently tied to ground, i.e., stuck-at-0, using a positive logic convention. To sensitize
the fault, the inputs A and B should both be set to 1, which should force the top and gate output to a 1 for a
good circuit. To propagate the fault, the inputs C and D should both be set to 0, which should force the xor
gate output to 1, again for a good circuit. Thus, if A ¼ 1, B
¼ 1, C ¼ 0, and D ¼ 0 in Figure 12.18, then a good circuit
would yield a 1, but the defective circuit yields a 0, which
detects the stuck-at-0 fault at the top and gate output.
Sequential ATP generation is more difﬁcult than
combinational ATPG because exercising or sensitizing a
particular circuit path to detect the presence of a possible
manufacturing fault may require a sequence of input test
vectors. One technique for testing sequential digital
systems is scan fault testing. Scan fault testing is an
example of design for testability (DFT) because it modiﬁes
or constrains a design in a manner that facilitates fault
testing. Scan techniques impose a logic design discipline
FIGURE 12.18

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

that connects all state registers into one or more chains to form ‘‘scan rings,’’ as shown in Figure 12.19
(Eichelberger and Williams, 1977).
During normal device operation, the scan rings are disabled and the registers serve as conventional memory
(state) storage elements. During test operation, the scan rings are enabled and stimulus test vectors are shifted
into the memory elements to set the state of the digital system. The digital system is exercised for one clock
cycle and then the results are shifted out of the scan ring to record the response.
A variation of scan DFT, called boundary scan, has been deﬁned for testing integrated circuits on printed
circuit boards (PCBs). Advancements in PCB manufacturing, such as ﬁne-lead components, surface mount
assembly, and multichip modules, have yielded high-density boards with fewer access points to probe
individual pins. These PCBs are difﬁcult to test. As the name implies, boundary scan imposes a design
discipline for PCB components to enable the input/output pins of the components to be connected into scan
chains. As an example, Figure 12.20 shows a simple PCB containing two integrated circuits conﬁgured for
boundary scan. Each integrated circuit contains scan registers between its input/output pins and its core logic
to enable the PCB test bus to control and observe the behavior of individual integrated circuits (Parker, 1989).
Another DFT technique is signature analysis, also called built-in self-test (BIST). Signature testing tech-
niques use additional logic, typically linear feedback shift registers, to generate automatically pseudorandom
test vectors. The output responses are compressed into a single vector and compared with a known good
vector. If the output response vector does not exactly match the known good vector, then the design is
considered faulty. Matching the output response vector and a known good vector does not guarantee correct
FIGURE 12.19
Scan-based DFT.

12-15
Digital and Analog Electronic Design Automation

hardware; however, if enough pseudorandom test vectors are exercised, then the chances are acceptably small
of obtaining a false positive result. Signature analysis is often used to test memories (Agrawal et al., 1993).
Coding test techniques encode signal information so that errors can be detected and possibly corrected.
Although often implemented in software, coding techniques can also be implemented in hardware. For
example, a simple coding technique called parity checking is often implemented in hardware. Parity checking
adds an extra bit to multibit data. The parity bit is set such that the total number of logic 1s in the multibit
data and parity bit is either an even number (even parity) or an odd number (odd parity). An error has
occurred if an even-parity-encoded signal contains an odd number of logic 1s or if an odd-parity-encoded
signal contains an even number of logic 1s. Coding techniques are used extensively to detect and correct
transmission errors on system buses and networks, storage errors in system memory, and computational
errors in processors (Peterson and Weldon, 1972).
Finally, electrical monitoring testing techniques, also called current/voltage testing, rely on the simple
observation that an out-of-range current or voltage often indicates a defective or bad part. Possibly a short or
open is present causing a particular input/output signal to have the wrong voltage or current. Current testing,
or Iddq testing, is particularly useful for digital systems using CMOS integrated circuit technology. Normally,
CMOS circuits have very low static or quiescent currents. However, physical faults, such as gate oxide defects,
can increase static current by several orders of magnitude. Such a substantial change in static current is
straightforward to detect. The principal advantages of current testing are that the tests are simple and the fault
models address detailed transistor-level defects. However, current testing requires that enough time be allotted
between input stimuli to allow the circuit to reach a static state, which slows testing down and causes problems
with circuits that cannot be tested at scaled clock rates.
12.7
Summary
DA technology offers the potential of serving as a powerful fulcrum in leveraging the skills of a designer against
the growing demands of electronic system design and manufacturing. DA programs help to relieve the
designer of the burden of tedious, repetitive tasks that can be labor-intensive and error prone.
DA technology can be broken down into several topical areas, such as design entry, synthesis, veriﬁcation,
physical design, and test. Each topical area has developed an extensive body of knowledge and experience.
Design entry deﬁnes a desired speciﬁcation. Synthesis reﬁnes the initial design speciﬁcation into a detailed
design ready for implementation. Veriﬁcation checks that the detailed design faithfully realizes the desired
speciﬁcation. Physical design deﬁnes the implementation, i.e., the actual hardware. Finally, test checks that the
manufactured part is functionally and parametrically correct.

SPICE is an of the industry standard software for circuit simulation [1]. It can perform dc, ac, transient,
Fourier, and Monte Carlo analyses. There are several SPICE-derived simulations packages, including Orcad
PSPICE, Meta-software HSPICE, and Intusoft IS-SPICE.
PSPICE contains more features than classical SPICE. Some of the most useful additional features are a post-
processor program, PROBE, that can be used for interactive graphical display of simulation results; and an
analog behavioral model facility that allows modeling of analog circuit functions by using mathematical
equations, tables, and transfer functions [2,3].
MATLAB is primarily a tool for matrix computations [4,5]. MATLAB has a rich set of plotting capabilities.
The graphics are integrated in MATLAB. Since MATLAB is also a programming environment, a user can
extend the functional capabilities by writing new modules (m-ﬁles). This chapter shows how the strong
features of PSPICE and the powerful functions of MATLAB can be used to perform extensive and complex
data analysis of electronic circuits [3,6].
13.1
PSPICE Fundamentals
A general SPICE program consists of the following components: (a) title; (b) element statements; (c) control
statements, and (d) end statement. The following two sections will discuss the element and control statements.
13-1

Element Statements
Element statements specify the elements in the circuit. An element statement contains the (a) element name;
(b) the circuit nodes to which each element is connected; and (c) the values of the parameters that electrically
characterize the element. The element name must begin with a letter of the alphabet that is unique to a circuit
element, source, or subcircuit. Table 13.1 shows the beginning alphabet of an element name and the
corresponding element.
Circuit nodes are positive integers. The nodes in the circuit need not be numbered sequentially. Node 0 is
predeﬁned for ground of a circuit. Element values can be integer, ﬂoating point number, and ﬂoating point
followed by an exponent.
Resistors
The general format for describing resistors is
Rname N + N  value*
where the name must start with the letter R. N+ and N are the positive and negative nodes of the resistor,
respectively.
Value speciﬁes the value of the resistor. The latter may be positive or negative, but not zero.
Inductors
The general format for describing linear inductors is
Lname N + N value [IC ¼ initial_current]
where the inductor name must start with the letter L, N + and N are positive and negative nodes of the
inductor, respectively, Value speciﬁes the value of the inductance, and the initial condition for transient
analysis is assigned using IC ¼ initial_current, to specify the initial current.

Cname N + N value [IC ¼ initial_voltage]
where the capacitor name must start with the letter C, N+ and N are the positive and negative nodes of the
capacitor, respectively, Value indicates the value of the capacitance, and the initial condition for transient
analysis is assigned using IC ¼ initial_voltage on the capacitor.
Independent Voltage Source

respectively, and sources can be assigned values for dc analysis [DC value], ac analysis [AC magnitude phase],
and transient analysis. Only one of the transient response source options (PULSE, SIN, EXP, PWL, SFFM) can
be selected for each source. The AC phase angle is in degrees. Discussion on the transient signal generators
(PULSE, SIN, EXP, PWL, SFFM) can be found in Al-Hashimi [2], Attia [3], or Roberts and Sedra [7].
Independent Current Source

where the current source must start with letter I, N+ and N are the positive and negative nodes of the source,
respectively. Current ﬂows from a positive node to the negative node, and independent current sources can be
assigned values for dc analysis [DC value], ac analysis [AC magnitude phase], and transient analysis. Only one
of the transient response source options (PULSE, SIN, EXP, PWL, SFFM) can be selected for each source. The
ac phase angle is in degrees.

Control Statements
Circuit Title
The circuit title must be the ﬁrst statement in the SPICE program or circuit netlist. If this is not done, the
program will assume that the ﬁrst statement is the circuit title.
dc Analysis (.DC)
The .DC control statement speciﬁes the values that will be used for dc sweep or dc analysis. The general format
for the .DC statement is
.DC SOURCE_NAME START-VALUE STOP_VALUE INCREMENT_VALUE
where SOURCE_NAME is the name of an independent voltage or current source and START_VALUE,
STOP_VALUE and INCREMENT_VALUE represent the starting, ending, and increment values of the source,
respectively.
Transient Analysis (.TRAN)
The .TRAN control statement is used to perform transient analysis on a circuit. The general format of the
.TRAN statement is
.TRAN TSTEP TSTOP ,TSTART. ,TMAX. ,UIC.
where the terms inside the angle brackets are optional, TSTEP is the printing or plotting increment, TSTOP is
the ﬁnal time of the transient analysis, TSTART is the starting time for printing out the results of the analysis.
If it is omitted, it is assumed to be zero. The transient analyses always start at time zero, TMAX is the
maximum step size that PSPICE uses for the purposes of computation. If TMAX is omitted, the default is the
smallest value of either TSTEP or (TSTOP  TSTART)/50, and UIC (use initial conditions) is used to specify
the initial conditions of capacitors and inductors.
There are ﬁve SPICE-supplied sources that can be used for transient analysis: (1) PULSE (for periodic pulse
waveform); (2) EXP (for exponential waveform); (3) PWL (for piece-wise linear waveform); (4) SIN (for a
sine wave); and (5) SFFM (for frequency-modulated waveform). The format for specifying the above sources
for transient analysis can be obtained from Al-Hashimi [2], Attia [3], or Roberts and Sedra [7].
AC Analysis (.AC)
The .AC control statement is used to perform ac analysis on a circuit. The general format of the .AC
statement is
.AC FREQ_VAR NP FSTART FSTOP
where FREQ_VAR is one of three keywords that indicates the frequency variation by decade (DEC), octave
(OCT), or linearly LIN), NP is the number of points; its interpretation depends on the keyword (DEC, OCT,
or LIN) in the FREQ. DEC - NP is the number of points per decade. OCT - NP is the number of points per
octave. LIN - NP is the total number of points spaced evenly from frequency FSTART and ending at FSTOP,
FSTART is the starting frequency; FSTART cannot be zero, and FSTOP is the ﬁnal or ending frequency.
Printing Command (.PRINT)
The .PRINT control statement is used to print tabular outputs. The general format of the .PRINT statement is
.PRINT ANALYSIS_TYPE OUTPUT_VARIABLE
13-4
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

where ANALYSIS_TYPE can be DC, AC, TRAN. Only one analysis type must be speciﬁed for .PRINTstatement
and OUTPUT-VARIABLE can be voltages or currents. Up to eight output variables can accompany one
.PRINT statement. If more than eight output variables are to be printed, additional .PRINT statements can be
used.
The output variable may be node voltages and current through voltage sources. PSPICE allows one to
obtain current ﬂowing through passive elements. The voltage output variable has the general form:
V(node 1, node 2) or V(node 1) if node 2 is node "0."
The current output variable has the general form
I (Vname)
where Vname is an independent-voltage source speciﬁed in the circuit netlist.
For PSPICE, the current output variable can also be speciﬁed as I(Rname), where Rname is resistance
deﬁned in the input circuit. For AC analysis, output voltage and current variables may be speciﬁed as real or
imaginary magnitude and phase. Table 13.2 shows the name types for AC output variables.
Initial Conditions (.IC, UIC)
The .IC statement is only used when the transient analysis statement, .TRAN, includes the ‘UIC’ option. The
initial voltage across a capacitor or the initial current ﬂowing through an inductor can be speciﬁed as part of
capacitor or inductor component statement. For example, for a capacitor we have:
Cname N+ N value IC ¼ initial voltage
and for an inductor, we use the statement:
Lname N+ N value IC ¼ initial current
It should be noted that the initial conditions on an inductor or capacitor are used provided that .TRAN
statement includes the ‘UIC’ option.
Several SPICE control commands are shown in Table 13.3. Details of using the control statements can be
found in Vladimirescu [1], Al-Hashimi [2], and Attia [3].
PSPICE Probe Statement (.PROBE)
Probe is a PSPICE interactive graphics processor that allows the user to display SPICE simulation results in
graphical format on a computer monitor. Probe has facilities that allow the user to access any point on a
displayed graph and obtain its numerical values. In addition, Probe has many built-in functions that enable a
user to compute and display mathematical expression that models aspects of circuit behavior. The general
format for specifying the probe statement is
.PROBE OUTPUT_VARIABLES
where OUTPUT_VARIABLES can be node voltages and/or devices currents. If no OUTPUT_VARIABLE is
speciﬁed, Probe will save all node voltages and device currents.

MATLAB Fundamentals
The Colon Symbol
The colon symbol (:) is one of the most important operators in MATLAB. It can be used (a) to create vectors
and matrices; (b) to specify sub-matrices and vectors; and (c) to perform iterations.
Creation of Vectors and Matrices
The statement
j1 ¼ 1:9
will generate a row vector containing the numbers from 1 to 9 with unit increment. Nonunity, positive, or
negative increments may be speciﬁed.
Specifying Submatrices and Vectors
Individual elements in a matrix can be referenced with subscripts inside parentheses. For example, j2(4) is the
fourth element of vector j2. Also, for matrix j3, j3(2, 3) denotes the entry in the second row and third column.
Using the colon as one of the subscripts denotes all of the corresponding row or column. For example, j3(:,4) is
the fourth column of matrix j3. Also, the statement j3(2,:) is the second row of matrix j3. If the colon exists as
the only subscript, such as j3(:), the latter denotes the elements of matrix j3 strung out in a long column
vector.
Iterative Uses of Colon Command
The iterative uses of the colon command are discussed in the next section.
FOR Loops
FOR loops allow a statement or group of statements to be repeated a ﬁxed number of times. The general form
of a FOR loop is
for index ¼ expression
statement group C
end
The expression is a matrix and the statement group C is repeated as many times as the number of elements in
the columns of the expression matrix. The index takes on the elemental values in the matrix expression.
Usually, the expression is something like:
m:n or m:i:n
where m is the beginning value, n the ending value, and i the increment.

IF Statements
The general form of the simple IF statement is
if logical expression 1
statement group G1
end
In the case of a simple IF statement, if the logical expression 1 is true, the statement group G1 is executed.
However, if the logical expression is false, the statement group G1 is bypassed and the program control jumps
to the statement that follows the end statement. Several variations of the IF statement are described in Etter [5]
and Attia [6].
IF statements use relational or logical operations to determine what steps to perform in the solution of
a problem. The relational operators in MATLAB forcomparing two matrices of equal size areshown in Table 13.4.
When any one of the above relational operators is used, a comparison is done between the pairs of
corresponding elements.
Graph Functions
MATLAB has built-in functions that allow you to generate x–y and 3-D plots. MATLAB also allows you to give
titles to graphs, label the x- and y-axes, and add grids to graphs.
x–y Plots and Annotations
If x and y are vectors of the same length, then the command
plot(x, y)
plots the element of x (x-axis) versus the elements of y (y-axis).
To plot multiple curves on a single graph, one can use the plot command with multiple arguments, such as
plot(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, . . ., xn, yn)
The variables x1, y1, x2, y2, and so on are pairs of vector. Each x–y pair is graphed, generating multiple lines on
the plot. The above plot command allows vectors of different lengths to be displayed on the same graph.
MATLAB automatically scales the plots.
When a graph is drawn, one can add a grid, title, label, and x- and y-axes to the graph. The commands for
grid, title, x-axis label, and y-axis label are grid (grid lines), title (graph title), xlabel (x-axis label), and ylabel
(y-axis label), respectively.
Logarithmic and Plot3 Functions
Logarithmic and semilogarithmic plots can be generated using the commands loglog, semilogx, and semilogy.
Descriptions of these commands follow:
loglog(x,y) — generates a plot of log10(x) versus log10(y)
semilogx(x, y) — generates a plot of log10(x) versus linear axis of y
semilogy(x, y) — generates a plot of linear axis of x versus log10(y)

Electronic Data Analysis Using PSPICE and MATLAB

The plot3 function can be used to do three-dimensional line plots. The function is similar to the two-
dimensional plot function. The plot3 function supports the same line size, line style, and color options that are
supported by the plot function. The simplest form of the plot3 function is
plot(x, y, z)
where x, y, and z are equal-sized arrays containing the locations of the data points to be plotted.
Subplot Function
The graph window can be partitioned into multiple windows. The subplot command allows the user to split
the graph into two subdivisions or four subdivisions. The general form of the subplot command is
subplot(i j k)
The digits i and j specify that the graph window is to be split into an i-by-j grid of smaller windows, arranged
in i rows and j columns. The digit k speciﬁes the kth window for the current plot. The subwindows are
numbered from left to right, top to bottom.
fprintf
The fprintf command can be used to print both text and matrix values. The format for printing the matrix can
be speciﬁed, and line feed can also be speciﬁed. The general form of this command is
fprintf(‘text with format speciﬁcation’, matrices)
The format speciﬁer, such as %7.3e, is used to show where the matrix value should be printed in the text. 7.3e
indicates that the value should be printed with an exponential notation of seven digits, three of which should
be decimal digits.
Other format speciﬁers are %c (single character); %d (signed decimal notation); %e (exponential notation);
%f (ﬁxed-point notation); and %g (signed decimal number in either %e or %f format, whichever is shorter).
The text with format speciﬁcation should end with \n to indicate the end of line.
m-ﬁles
MATLAB is capable of processing a sequence of commands that are stored in ﬁles with extension m. MATLAB
ﬁles with extension m are called m-ﬁles. The latter are ASCII text ﬁles and are created with a text editor or
word processor. m-ﬁles can either be scripts or functions. Script and function ﬁles contain a sequence of
commands. However, function ﬁles take arguments and return values.
Script Files
Script ﬁles are especially useful for analysis and design problems that require long sequences of MATLAB
commands. With a script ﬁle written using a text editor or word processor, the ﬁle can be invoked by entering the
name of the m-ﬁle without the extension. Statements in a script ﬁle operate globally on the workspace data.
Function Files
Function ﬁles are m-ﬁles that are used to create new MATLAB functions. Variables deﬁned and manipulated
inside a function ﬁle are local to the function, and they do not operate globally on the workspace. However,
arguments may be passed into and out of a function ﬁle.
The general form of a function ﬁle is
function variable(s) ¼ function_name (arguments)
% help text in the usage of the function
.
.

Data Analysis Functions
In MATLAB, data analyses are performed on column-oriented matrices. Variables are stored in the individual
column cells, and each row represents different observation of each variable. Functions act on the elements in
the column. Table 13.5 gives a brief description of various MATLAB functions for performing data analysis.
Curve Fitting (Polyﬁt, Polyval)
The MATLAB polyﬁt function is used to compute the best ﬁt of a set of data points to a polynomial with a
speciﬁed degree. The general form of the function is
poly_xy ¼ polyﬁt(x, y, n)
where x and y are the data points, n is the nth degree polynomial that will ﬁt the vectors x and y, and poly_xy
is a polynomial that ﬁts the data in vector y to x in the least-squares sense. poly_xy returns (n + 1) coefﬁcients
in descending powers of x.
Thus, the polynomial ﬁt to vectors x and y is given as
poly xyðxÞ ¼ a1xn þ a2xn1 þ ::: am
The degree of the polynomial is n and the number of coefﬁcients m ¼ n + 1. The coefﬁcients (a1, a2, . . ., am) are
returned by the MATLAB polyﬁt function.
Save, Load, and Textread Functions
Save and Load Commands
The save command saves data in the MATLAB workspace to disk. The save command can store data either
in memory-efﬁcient binary format, called a MAT-ﬁle or ASCII ﬁle. The general form of the save command is
save ﬁlename [List of variables] [options]

where save (without ﬁlename, list of variables, and options) saves all the data in the current workspace to a ﬁle
named matlab.mat in the current directory. If a ﬁlename is included in the command line, the data will be
saved in ﬁle ‘‘ﬁlename.mat.’’ If a list of variables in included, only those variables will be saved.
Options for the save command are shown in Table 13.6.
MAT-ﬁles are preferable for data that are generated to be used by MATLAB. MAT-ﬁles are platform
independent. The ﬁles can be written and read by any computer that supports MATLAB. The ASCII ﬁles are
preferable if the data are to be exported or imported to programs other than MATLAB.
The load command will load data from MAT-ﬁle or ASCII ﬁle into the current workspace. The general
format of the load command is
load ﬁlename [options]
where load (by itself without ﬁlename and options) will load all the data in ﬁle matlab.mat into the current
workspace and load ﬁlename will load data from the speciﬁed ﬁlename.
Options for the load command are shown in Table 13.7.
The Textread Function
The textread command can be used to read ASCII ﬁles that are formatted into columns of data, where values
in each column might be a different type. The general form of the textread command is
[a, b, c,. . .] ¼ textread(ﬁlename, format, n)
where ﬁlename is the name of ﬁle to open. The ﬁlename should be in quotes, as in ‘ﬁlename’, format is a string
containing a description of the type of data in each column. The format list should be in quotes. Supported
functions include %d (read a signed integer value); %u (read an integer value); %f (read a ﬂoating point
value); and %s (read a whitespace separated string), n is the number of lines to read. If n is missing, the
command reads to the end of the ﬁle, and a, b, c. . . are the output arguments. The number of output
arguments must match the number of columns that are being read.
13.4
Interfacing SPICE to MATLAB
To exploit the best features of PSPICE and MATLAB, circuit simulation is performed by using PSPICE. The
PSPICE results, which are written into a ﬁle, ﬁlename.out, are edited using a text editor or a word processor
and the data will be saved as ﬁlename.dat. The data are read using either MATLAB textread or load commands.
Further processing of the data is performed using MATLAB. The methodology is shown in Figure 13.1.
In the following examples, the methodology described in this section will be used to analyze data obtained
from electronic circuits.

Electronic Data Analysis Using PSPICE and MATLAB

13.5
Conclusions
SPICE is an industry-standard software for circuit simulation. MATLAB is primarily a tool for matrix
computations. It has numerous functions for data processing and analysis. PSPICE can be used to perform dc,
ac, transient, Fourier, temperature and Monte Carlo analysis of electronic circuits with device models and
subsystem subcircuits. MATLAB can then be used to perform calculation of device parameters, curve ﬁtting,
statistical analysis, and two- and three-dimensional plots. The strong features of PSPICE and powerful
functions of MATLAB, when used in conjunction, allow extensive and complex data analysis of electronic
circuits.

The subject of electromagnetic ﬁelds is the study of ﬁelds created due to moving and/or stationary electric
charges and their applications. The study of electromagnetic ﬁelds is important for understanding the basic
principles and design of electrical analog and digital devices and circuits. These digital and analog systems are
expanding the use of GHz range spectrums in communication technology in order to increase bandwidth and
speed. Electromagnetic ﬁelds can be divided into three groups (i) steady or static electric ﬁelds (ii) static
magnetic ﬁelds, and (iii) time varying ﬁelds.
14.1
Static Electric Fields
The steady electric ﬁelds are produced by a moving or stationary electric charge. The most common
mathematical tool used for analyzing electric and magnetic ﬁelds is vector algebra. The application of vector
algebra makes the analysis very simple and less time consuming. Most of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds laws
ﬁrst investigated by scientists were laws derived from experiment and were known by their discoverers. These
laws included Coulomb’s law, Faraday’s law, Ohm’s law, and Ampere’s law. Finally, James Clerk Maxwell gave a
mathematical formulation to these laws in the form of Maxwell’s four equations. By solving these four
Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic ﬁelds, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds for any conﬁguration can be
obtained with appropriate boundary conditions. The focus of this chapter is a brief explanation and analysis of
these basic laws, as well as associated laws which led to Maxwell’s four equations. In addition, some important
applications are discussed.
Experimental Law of Coulomb and Electric Field Intensity
A French army ofﬁcer, Charles Coulomb, experimented with electric charges and concluded that a force exists
between two electric charges. This force is proportional to the charges and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them, provided the distance is very large compared to the size of the charges.
His analysis showed similarity with Newton’s gravitational law. The mathematical form of the law is given as [1]:
14-1

F ¼ k Q1Q2
R2
ð14:1Þ
where Q1 and Q2 represent positive or negative charges (C), R is the distance (m) between the charges, and k is
the constant of proportionality. In SI units k ¼ 1/4pe0 with e0 ¼ 1 · 109/36p ¼ 8.854 · 1012 F/m. Coulomb’s
law in free space or vacuum is written as
F ¼ Q1Q2
4pe0R2 N
ð14:2Þ
In vector notations Equation (14.2) is written as
F ¼ Q1Q2
4pe0R2 aR N
ð14:3Þ
where aR is the unit vector in the direction of R given by
aR ¼ R=jRj ¼ R=R
ð14:4Þ
This force is known as electric ﬁeld and now the electric ﬁeld intensity can be explained as the force on a unit
positive charge as
E ¼ F=Qt V=m
ð14:5Þ
where Qt is the test charge. The units of electric ﬁeld intensity are N/C or equivalently, V/m. Now the electric
ﬁeld intensity due to a charge Q on a test charge Qt at a distance R can be written as
E ¼ F=Qt ¼
QQt
4pe0R2Qt
aR ¼
Q
4pe0R2 aR
ð14:6Þ
This electric ﬁeld intensity vector is in the direction of test charge from charge Q and is directed radially
outward along unit vector aR.
Concept of Differential Charge Elements and Electric Field Intensity
Due to Various Charge Distributions
In the natural world all the charge distributions are not as point forms but may be as line, surface or volume
charge distributions. In order to determine the electric ﬁeld intensity due to these charge distributions using
Coulomb’s law, as discussed in the last section, the concept of differential charge element has to be introduced.
Any charge distribution can be assumed to be made of an inﬁnite number of differential charge elements
separated by an inﬁnitely small distance. The electric ﬁeld intensity at any point due to this particular charge
distribution is the summation of ﬁeld intensities due to all these differential charge elements. In other words,
we can state that Coulomb’s law is linear. If the distance between two adjacent charge elements approaches
zero, and the number of charges is assumed to be inﬁnity, the summation can be replaced by integration. This
differential charge elements concept is the basis for ﬁnding electric ﬁeld intensity due to different charge
distributions. This concept is shown in Figure 14.1.
The electric ﬁeld intensity at point P is the summation of the ﬁeld intensities due to differential charge
elements 1, 2, . . . n as given by
E ¼ dE1 þ dE2 þ · · · þ dEn
ð14:7Þ
where dEn ¼
dQn

The concept of differential charges can be easily applied to line, surface and volume charge distributions.
They have been expressed as follows:
Inﬁnite line charge: E ¼
rl
2pe0r arV=m, radially outward along r; rl is the line charge density per unit length, r
is the distance of the point from the line and e0 is the permittivity of free space.
Inﬁnite surface charge: E ¼ rs
2e0
anV=m, normal to the surface; rs is the surface charge density per unit
surface area.
Volume charge: E ¼ R
vol
rvdv
4pe0R2aR V/m; rv is the volume charge density and R is distance of the point where
electric ﬁeld intensity is to be determined.
All these electric ﬁeld intensities are determined using a particular coordinate system. The rectangular
coordinate system is simplest and also easy to implement. However, where there is cylindrical and spherical
symmetry, it is easier to use cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems, respectively. In cylindrical symmetry
there is symmetry about a line which can be considered as one of the axes of the rectangular coordinate
system. In the case of spherical coordinate system there is symmetry about a point which can be considered as
the origin of the rectangular coordinate system. In practice, a coaxial cable can be analyzed using the concept
of line charge while a capacitor or strip line can be analyzed on the basis of surface or sheet charge. The
formula developed for an inﬁnite surface charge can be used for a parallel capacitor under the condition that
the area of plates is very large compared to the separation between the plates so that the uniform charge
distribution is valid.
Concept of Electric Flux Density and Gauss’s Law
In 1837, Michael Faraday conducted an experiment with two concentric charged spheres where he showed an
induced charge on the outer sphere due to a charged inner sphere. He concluded that this was possible only if
some sort of ‘‘displacement’’ took place from inner to outer spherical conductor. This displacement is known
as ‘‘displacement’’, ‘‘displacement ﬂux’’, or simply ‘‘the electric ﬂux.’’ The induced charge on the outer
conductor is opposite and is directly proportional to the charge on the inner conductor. Also, the induced
charge is independent of the medium between two conductors. In SI units the relationship between the charge
on inner conductor and electric ﬂux is given by
C ¼ Q
ð14:8Þ
where C is the electric ﬂux in coulomb and Q is the charge on inner conductor. We can now deﬁne the electric
ﬂux density vector in radial direction on the surface of the spherical conductor of radius ‘‘a’’ as
D ¼
C
4pa2 ar ¼ ar C=m2

For concentric spheres, as shown in Figure 14.2, where a and b are
inner and outer radii, respectively, the ﬂux density is given by
Djr¼a¼

and
Djr¼b¼

ð14:10Þ
The fundamental difference between surface charge density and
ﬂux density is that surface charge density can only be deﬁned on a
conducting surface while ﬂux density can be deﬁned on any
surface, even on an imaginary surface. In the case of a point
charge, the electric ﬂux density is given by
D ¼
Q
4pr2 ar C=m2
ð14:11Þ
From Equation (14.6) and Equation (14.11) the relationship between D and E is obtained as
D ¼ e0E
ðin free space onlyÞ
ð14:12Þ
Again, in practice, the medium surrounding a charge distribution is generally a dielectric medium. Thus, it is
important to understand the effect on the electric ﬁeld due to these dielectric materials. The most commonly
used dielectric materials in electrical circuits are: quartz, Teﬂon, rubber, glass, duroid, and alumina. The
positive and negative charges separated by atomic distances in these dielectrics are known as bound charges, as
they are not free to move. These bound charges form the dipoles in the dielectric materials [2]. In the presence
of an external electric ﬁeld these dipoles rotate so as to align with the external ﬁeld. The force of rotation is
dependent on the charge value and distance between the charges. The quantity dipole moment p is deﬁned as
p ¼ Qd Cm
ð14:13Þ
where Q is the absolute value of the charge and d is the distance vector from negative to positive charge. In the
case of a dielectric volume containing a large number of dipoles, the polarization vector P is the dipole
moments per unit volume given as
P ¼ limDv!0Sipi=Dv
ð14:14Þ
If there is no electric ﬁeld applied, the dipoles are oriented in a random fashion canceling their dipole
moments and the material is said to be nonpolarized. The polarization in the direction of an applied
electric ﬁeld is the direction of polarization vector P. Thus, for the dielectrics the ﬂux density is related to
E and P as
D ¼ e0 E þ P C=m2
ð14:15Þ
The polarization vector P is further related to electric ﬁeld through electric susceptibility of the material, we as
P ¼ e0weE
ð14:16Þ
Now from Equation (14.15) and Equation (14.16) we obtain:

The term (1þwe) ¼ er is known as the relative permittivity or dielectric constant of the material which relates
to D and E as
D ¼ e0 er E ¼ e E
ð14:18Þ
where e ¼ e0 er is the permittivity of the material.
From Equation (14.18) it is evident that D and E can be conveniently interchanged. Also for isotropic
dielectrics D and E have linear relationship, i.e., each component of D is a function of only that component of
E. However, in the case of anisotropic dielectrics, each component of D is a function of every component of E.
The relationship D ¼ e E still holds, but now e is a tensor given in rectangular coordinates as

Anisotropic materials are particularly useful in microstrip directional couplers where they provide very high
directivity and coupling coefﬁcients [3].
Gauss’s Law: Based on Faraday’s experiment, Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians, developed a
general form of the law which can be stated as ‘‘if a charge is enclosed within a surface, the electric ﬂux passing
through the closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface.’’ Faraday’s experiment and laws
applied only to concentric spherical surfaces but Gauss’s law applied to any surface. Gauss’s main contribution
was not merely the wider applicability of his law but its mathematical formulation:
C ¼
I
s D · dS ¼ charge enclosed ¼ Q
ð14:20Þ
where D is the ﬂux density on the surface ‘‘s.’’
The charge enclosed can be in the form of a point charge, line charge, surface charge or volume charge. For
volume charge distribution, Gauss’s law can be written as
C ¼
I
s D · dS ¼ Q ¼
Z
vol rvdv
ð14:21Þ
where c is the ﬂux crossing through the surface ‘‘s,’’ also known as the ‘‘Gaussian surface,’’ and rv is the
volume charge distribution enclosed by this surface.
In order to get a solution using Gauss’s law it is important that the surface is symmetrical, where the ﬂux
density D is constant on the surface. Because of this there is no need at all to do integration and the total
charge enclosed is simply the multiplication of the constant ﬂux density on the surface and the total surface
area. Thus, the solution of symmetrical charge distribution problems becomes simpler using Gauss’s law
compared to Coulomb’s law. If we apply Gauss’s law to a differential volume element with the volume
approaching to zero, the ﬂux density D can be almost constant on an approximate Gaussian surface, but not
on an asymmetrical surface. This particular approximation leads to the application of a divergence theorem to
electrical charge distribution problems resulting from Maxwell’s equation:
Div D ¼ H · D ¼ rv ¼ qDx
qx þ qDy
qy þ qDz
qz
ðin rectangular coordinatesÞ
ð14:22Þ
Now from Equation (14.21) and Equation (14.22) we obtain a divergence theorem for electrical charge
distribution as
I
s D · dS ¼
Z
vol rvdv ¼
Z
vol H · D dv
ð14:23Þ
14-5
Electromagnetic Fields

Using the divergence theorem, the surface integral is converted to a volume integral to solve electrical charge
distribution problems. It is important to note that while Coulomb’s law is applicable to any charge
distribution, Gauss’s law provides simpler solutions to symmetrical charge distribution problems only.
Energy and Potential
If we want to move a charge placed in an electric ﬁeld, work is required as the charge is moved against the ﬁeld.
This work is also known as the energy expended. However, if the charge is moved in the direction of the ﬁeld,
no work is required. As charge Q is moved through distance dL in an electric ﬁeld E, the force on Q due to
electric ﬁeld is
F ¼ QE
ð14:24Þ
The component of this force in the direction dL against which the external force has to be applied is given as
FL ¼ F · aL ¼ QE · aL
ð14:25Þ
where aL is a unit vector in the direction of dL. The external force to move the charge must be equal and
opposite to the force due to the ﬁeld, i.e., the applied force is
Fapplied ¼ FL ¼ QE · aL
ð14:26Þ
Now the energy expended or the work done in moving charge Q a distance dL through the ﬁeld E is given by
dW ¼ Fapplied dL ¼ QE · aL dL ¼ QE · dL
ð14:27Þ
From Equation (14.27), it is evident that if E and dL are at 90–, i.e., if the charge is moved in a normal
direction with respect to the direction of electric ﬁeld, the work done is zero. Now the work done or energy
expended to move the charge through a ﬁnite distance is obtained by integrating Equation (14.27) as
W ¼ Q
Zfinal
initial E · dL joule
ð14:28Þ
It is interesting to note that the work done is independent of the path along which the charge is moved from
initial to ﬁnal position. This concept of energy has been very well utilized in the description of potential energy
associated with electrons in the orbits of an atom. Here it is assumed that each electron has been moved from
inﬁnity to the orbits of the atom and is held in this orbit. The kinetic energy in moving these electrons is
transformed to potential energy. Also, since the potential at inﬁnity is assumed to be zero, the energy
associated with each electron is increasingly negative at lower energy levels or at inner orbits of the atom.
Potential Difference and Potential
Now we are in a position to deﬁne the potential difference V in terms of the work done by the external source
in moving a positive unit charge from initial to ﬁnal position in an electric ﬁeld:
V ¼ 
Zfinal
initial E · dL joule=C or volts ðVÞ
ð14:29Þ
In terms of initial and ﬁnal positions as ‘‘b’’ and ‘‘a,’’ Equation (14.28) can be written as
V ¼ 

For a point charge Q placed at the origin of the coordinate system, the potential difference between points A

ð14:31Þ
In practice we prefer to deﬁne potential in absolute terms as simply ‘‘potential.’’ It means the initial point
potential is considered a reference potential which may be zero or some constant value. The most commonly used
references with zero potential are: ground, inﬁnity, and the outer conductor of a coaxial line. The ground or
surface of the earth is considered as an inﬁnite conductor with zero potential. The reference, inﬁnity, is useful for
theoretical problems and for applications where it is not possible to use a ground as a reference. For a reference
point potential to be used as a constant, the potential at some point has to be known. It is important to note that
the potential is a scalar ﬁeld and does not involve any unit vector. Surfaces having the same potential are known as
equipotential surfaces, i.e., the potential difference between two points on an equipotential surface is always zero.
Another important parameter associated with potentials is the ‘‘potential gradient,’’ which is the maximum
rate of change of a potential in any direction. It is related to the electric ﬁeld intensity as
E ¼ grad V ¼ HV
ð14:32Þ
It is evident that the gradient of V is a vector quantity and can be written in rectangular, cylindrical, and
spherical coordinate systems as
E ¼ HV ¼  qV

In actual practice the potential and the potential gradient are the
terms used as measurable parameters in place of the term
electric ﬁeld intensity. One of the most important applications of
the potential concept is in the analysis of dipoles. An electric
dipole, or simply a dipole, consists of two point charges of
equal magnitude and opposite sign and separated by a small
distance. Dipole analysis compares the distance from the dipole
to the point where potential or electric ﬁeld is to be determined.
The dipole concept is very important in understanding the
behavior of dielectric materials and analysis of capacitors. The
dipole conﬁguration is shown in Figure 14.3.

where r is the distance of the ﬁeld point from dipole center. The vector distance between two equal point
charges is measured from negative to positive charge. It is evident that the V and E ﬁelds of dipoles fall at a
faster rate compared to the ﬁelds of a point charge.
14.2
Static Magnetic Fields and Basic Laws
Static magnetic ﬁelds are produced by a permanent magnet or an electric ﬁeld linearly changing with time or a
direct current. It is important to note that an electric ﬁeld is produced by a stationary or a moving charge.
A magnetic ﬁeld, however, is produced only by a moving charge. Also, a moving charge produces a current
which in turn produces a magnetic ﬁeld. Similar to an electric ﬁeld, a magnetic ﬁeld produces a force on
another magnetic ﬁeld or current element.
Biot–Savart Law
In some respects a magnetic ﬁeld is similar to an electric ﬁeld but in other respects it is completely different.
In order to understand the concept of a magnetic ﬁeld, we start by examining a differential current element.
A differential current element is a very small, approaching zero, section of a ﬁlamentary conductor.
A ﬁlamentary conductor is a cylindrical, current-carrying conductor with a radius approaching zero.
According to the Biot–Savart law, the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity at a point due to a differential
current element is proportional to the product of current, the magnitude of differential length, and the sine of
the smaller angle between the current element and a line joining the current element to the point where ﬁeld is
to be determined. It is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the differential element to
the ﬁeld point. Using the constant of proportionality 1/4p in SI units, the law can be written as
dH ¼ ðIdL · aRÞ=4p R2 ¼ ðIdL · RÞ=4pR3
ð14:37Þ
where I is the current through differential current element of length dL, R is the distance from differential
element to the ﬁeld point P, and aR is the unit vector in the direction of vector R. It is important to note that
the current element is part of a closed conducting circuit. This was shown when we considered dc or non-time
varying ﬁelds requiring a closed circuit. On closer examination of the Biot–Savart law it is evident that it is
analogous to Coulomb’s law for differential electric charges except with respect to the direction of the ﬁeld.
Since a closed circuit for dc analysis is necessary, the more practical magnetic ﬁeld equation is the integral
form of Equation (14.37) as
H ¼
I
ðIdL · aRÞ=4pR2 A=m
ð14:38Þ
For an inﬁnitely long ﬁlamentary current-carrying conductor (I), the magnetic ﬁeld intensity is found along
the concentric circles around the conductor, and is given by
H ¼
I
2pr aj A=m
ð14:39Þ
For distributed current sources of surface current density K and volume current density J, Equation (14.38) is
modiﬁed as
H ¼
Z
S ðK · aR dSÞ=4p R2
and
H ¼
Z
vol ðJ · aR dvÞ=4p R2
ð14:40Þ
These equations can be used to determine magnetic ﬁeld intensities due to ﬁlamentary, surface, and volume
current distributions.

Ampere’s Circuital Law
As we have seen in the case of electric ﬁeld intensities, some symmetrical charge distribution problems can be
easily analyzed using Gauss’s law. Similarly, Ampere’s circuital law in magnetic ﬁelds can be considered as
analogous to Gauss’s law, and can be applied to certain current distribution problems with greater ease.
According to Ampere’s circuital law, the line integral of H around a closed path is equal to the direct current
enclosed by that path, and is written as
I
H · dL ¼ Ienclosed
ð14:41Þ
For solving problems, we determine the enclosed path known as the Amperian path around the current
distribution just like a Gaussian surface in the electric ﬁeld case. This method can be used for determining the
magnetic ﬁeld intensity due to a coaxial line, current sheet, solenoid, and toroid. The magnetic ﬁeld intensity
due to a current sheet with current density K A/m is obtained as
H ¼ 1
2 K · aN
ð14:42Þ
If there are two current sheets carrying currents in opposite directions, the magnetic ﬁeld intensities are
H ¼ K · aN
ðpoint is between the two sheetsÞ; H ¼ 0
ðpoint is outsideÞ
ð14:43Þ
This approach is very useful for determining magnetic ﬁeld intensity due to a coaxial line or a strip line. If we
apply Ampere’s circuital law to the perimeter of a differential surface which encloses the current J, we obtain a
very important result:
H · H ¼ curl H ¼ J
ð14:44Þ
which is actually the point or differential form of Ampere’s circuital law. Similarly for static electric ﬁeld we
can write
H · E ¼ 0
ð14:45Þ
Concept of Magnetic Flux Density and Gauss’s Law for Magnetic Fields
The magnetic ﬂux density B is similar to electric ﬂux density D and is related to magnetic ﬁeld intensity H in a
similar manner as D is related to E as
B ¼ m0 H ðfree spaceÞ
or
B ¼ m H ðfor other materialÞ Wb=m2 or tesla ðTÞ
ð14:46Þ
where m is the permeability of the material which is m0 ¼ 4p · 107 H/m for free space. Now we can deﬁne the
total magnetic ﬂux crossing through a surface S as
F ¼
Z
S B · dS Wb
ð14:47Þ
By comparing the magnetic ﬂux passing through a closed surface to the electric ﬂux case or Gauss’s law for
magnetic ﬁelds is
F ¼
I
S B · dS ¼ 0
ð14:48Þ
14-9
Electromagnetic Fields

Since the magnetic ﬁeld or magnetic ﬂux due to a ﬁlamentary conductor is found along concentric circles
around the conductor, the ﬂux crossing through a closed surface is zero. This clearly shows that unlike electric
ﬂux lines, magnetic ﬂux lines do not cross the surface and are continuous lines around the conductor. This
also suggests that there are not isolated magnetic poles like electric charges, which is a fundamental difference
between electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Thus, Gauss’s law for a magnetic ﬁeld becomes Equation (14.48), or in
differential or point form using divergence theorem, it is written as
H · B ¼ 0
ð14:49Þ
These four important equations discussed so far are known as Maxwell’s equations for static or non-time

Concept of Magnetic Potential
In order to draw parallelism between electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we can deﬁne magnetic scalar potential
similar to electric potential as
H ¼ HVm
ð14:51Þ
The main difﬁculty with this scalar magnetic potential is that, unlike electric potential, it is not constant. We
have seen that once the reference has been deﬁned, the electric potential at any point in the electric ﬁeld is
constant. It does not depend on the path along which the charge is moved, but in the case of scalar magnetic
potential it depends on the speciﬁc path selected. It means the scalar magnetic potential at any point in the
ﬁeld is changing according to the path selected. Because of this, the scalar magnetic potential does not have
any practical signiﬁcance. It is the vector magnetic potential A, which is extremely useful in analyzing
electromagnetic radiation from antennae, transmission lines, and waveguides, and is related to B as
B ¼ H · A Wb=m2
ð14:52Þ
From Equation (14.52) we can see that the units of vector magnetic potential A are Wb/m. The vector
magnetic potential A for a ﬁlamentary current conductor, surface current, and volume current, respectively, is
obtained from

closed circuit is given as

Magnetic Forces
If a moving charge is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld, it experiences a force as in an electric ﬁeld. For a differential
charge element dQ moving with a velocity v and placed in a magnetic ﬁeld B, the differential force is
dF ¼ dQ v · B
ð14:55Þ
In terms of volume charge density rv, the differential charge dQ ¼ rv dv, and the force on this differential
charge from Equation (14.55) can be written as
dF ¼ rv dv v · B ¼ J · B dv
ð14:56Þ
The force on a differential current element (for surface current and ﬁlamentary current) is obtained as
dF ¼ K · B dS
and
dF ¼ I dL · B
ð14:57Þ
In all the above equations it is assumed that the differential current element is part of a closed circuit. Now
from Equation (14.56) and Equation (14.57) the force on a complete path in a volume or on a surface or on a
closed ﬁlamentary path is obtained through integration as
F ¼

The force on a straight ﬁlamentary conductor of length L placed in a magnetic ﬁeld B is obtained as
F ¼ IL · B
ð14:59Þ
and magnitude of this force is given by
F ¼ BIL siny
ð14:60Þ
where y is the angle between the direction of current ﬂow and direction of magnetic ﬂux density.
The concept of magnetic forces is useful in electric motor and generators and magnetic forklift trucks that
upload metallic objects. It is important to note that electric and magnetic ﬁelds vary from one material to
another and follow certain boundary conditions. These boundary conditions are important in the study of
materials and electric/magnetic circuit components. Electric circuit components like resistors, capacitors, and
inductors are analyzed on the basis of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and boundary conditions of different
materials in these ﬁelds.

Time-Varying Electromagnetic Fields and Maxwell’s Equations
Ampere’s circuital law (or simply Ampere’s law), Gauss’s law, and Faraday’s law form the four Maxwell’s
equations of electromagnetic ﬁelds. The main contribution of Maxwell is the mathematical formulation of
these laws. These four equations have become the heart of the study of electromagnetic ﬁelds for both the static
ﬁelds and time-varying ﬁelds. So far, for the sake of simplicity, our focus has been the static, or steady electric,
and magnetic ﬁelds. In practice, we have to solve many problems related to time-varying ﬁelds. We have
already discussed the ﬁrst two laws in the previous sections and now attention is given to Faraday’s law so that
these four equations can be discussed in greater depth. According to Faraday’s law, a time-varying magnetic
14-11

ﬁeld produces an electric ﬁeld. It means if a conducting coil is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld that is changing with
time, a voltage is induced across the terminals of the coil resulting in current ﬂow through the coil. The
induced voltage is also known as electromotive force (emf), and Faraday’s law can be mathematically written as
induced voltage or emf ¼ dF=dt
ð14:61Þ
where the negative sign indicates that the magnetic ﬂux due to induced voltage opposes the applied magnetic
ﬂux, which is also known as ‘‘Lenz’s law,’’ and F is the time varying magnetic ﬂux. It is evident that a steady or
static magnetic ﬁeld cannot produce induced voltage. If there are N number of turns in the coil, the induced
voltage is
induced voltage or emf ¼ N dF=dt
ð14:62Þ
Using the deﬁnition of voltage for emf with electric ﬁeld E, and writing F in terms of magnetic ﬂux density B,
the emf is obtained as
emf ¼

E · dL ¼  d

ð14:63Þ
Since this emf can be obtained by varying the magnetic ﬁeld in any direction, by varying the closed path, or by
changing both, the emf can be written as

ð14:64Þ
which is the integral form of Faraday’s law and the differential form is written as

ð14:65Þ
Again from Equation (14.65) it is evident that for static magnetic ﬁelds H · E ¼ 0, i.e., a steady magnetic ﬁeld
cannot produce an electric ﬁeld. Now we can write the four Maxwell’s equations as

In addition to these four Maxwell’s equations, we also need two other relationships to determine electric and

relationships, written as
D ¼ e E
and
B ¼ m H for isotropic medium
ð14:68Þ
where e and m are permittivity and permeability, respectively. Maxwell’s equations are very useful tools to
determine electric and magnetic ﬁelds in any medium with proper boundary conditions.

Static Magnetic Fields
To understand the phenomenon of magnetism we must also consider electricity and vice versa. A stationary
electric charge produces, at a point a ﬁxed distance from the charge, a static (i.e., time-invariant) electric ﬁeld.
A moving electric charge, i.e., a current, produces at the same point a time-dependent electric ﬁeld and a
magnetic ﬁeld, dH, whose magnitude is constant if the electric current, I, represented by the moving electric
charge, is constant.
Fields from Constant Currents
Figure 15.1 shows that the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular both to the current I and to the line,
R, from the element dL of the current to a point, P, where the magnetic ﬁeld, dH, is being calculated or
measured:
dH ¼ I dL · R=4pR3
A=m when I is in amps and dL and R are in meters
If the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the current, then the ﬁngers of the hand curl in the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the stream lines of H, i.e., the lines representing at any point the
direction of the H ﬁeld, will be an inﬁnite set of circles having the current as center. The magnitude of the ﬁeld
Hf ¼ I/2pR A/m. The line integral of H about any closed path around the current is H H · dL ¼ I.
15-1

This relationship (known as Ampe`re’s circuital law) allows one to ﬁnd formulas for the magnetic ﬁeld strength
for a variety of symmetrical coil geometries, e.g.:
1. At a radius, r, between the conductors of a coaxial cable:
Hf ¼ I=2pr A=m
2. Between two inﬁnite current sheets in which the current, K, ﬂows in opposite directions:
H ¼ K · an
where an is the unit vector normal to the current sheets.
3. Inside an inﬁnitely long, straight solenoid of diameter d, having N turns closely wound:
H ¼ NI=d A=m
4. Well inside a toroid of radius r, having N closely wound turns:
H ¼ NI=2pr · af A=m
Applying Stokes’ theorem to Ampe`re’s circuital law we ﬁnd the point form of the latter:
H · H ¼ J
where J is the current density in amps per square meter.
Time-Dependent Electric and Magnetic Fields
A constant current I produces a constant magnetic ﬁeld H which, in turn, polarizes the medium containing H.
While we cannot obtain isolated magnetic poles, it is possible to separate the ‘‘poles’’ by a small distance to
create a magnetic dipole (i.e., to polarize the medium), and the dipole moment (the product of the pole
strength and the separation of the poles) per unit volume is deﬁned as the magnetization M. The units are
emu/cc in the cgs system and amps per meter in the SI system of units. Because it is usually easier to determine
the mass of a sample than to determine its volume, we also have a magnetization per unit mass, s, whose units
are emu/g or Am2/kg. The conversion factors between cgs and SI units in magnetism are shown in Table 15.1.
The effects of the static and time-varying currents may be summarized as follows:
where the sufﬁxes ‘‘o’’ and ‘‘t’’ signify static and time-dependent, respectively.
FIGURE 15.1
A current I ﬂowing through a small segment dL of a wire produces at a distance R a magnetic ﬁeld whose
direction dH is perpendicular both to R and dL.

Magnetic Flux Density
In the case of electric ﬁelds there is in addition to E an electric ﬂux density ﬁeld D, the lines of which begin on
positive charges and end on negative charges. D is measured in coulombs per square meter and is associated
with the electric ﬁeld E (V/m) by the relation D ¼ Er EoE where Eo is the permittivity of free space
(Eo ¼ 8.854 · 10–12 F/m) and Er is the (dimensionless) dielectric constant.
For magnetic ﬁelds there is a magnetic ﬂux density B(Wb/m2) ¼ mrmoH, where mo is the permeability of free
space (mo¼4p · 10–7 H/m) and mr is the (dimensionless) permeability. In contrast to the lines of the D ﬁeld,
lines of B are closed, having no beginning or ending. This is not surprising when we remember that while
isolated positive and negative charges exist, no magnetic monopole has yet been discovered.
Relative Permeabilities
The range of the relative permeabilities covers about six orders of magnitude (Table 15.2) whereas the range of
dielectric constants is only three orders of magnitude.
Forces on a Moving Charge
A charged particle, q, traveling with a velocity n and subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force:
F ¼ qv · B
This equation reveals how the Hall effect can be used to determine whether the majority current carriers in a
sample of a semiconductor are (negatively charged) electrons ﬂowing, say, in the negative direction or
(positively charged) holes ﬂowing in the positive direction. The (transverse) force (Figure 15.2) will be in the
same direction in either case, but the sign of the charge transported to the voltage probe will be positive for
holes and negative for electrons.
In general, when both electric and magnetic ﬁelds are present, the force experienced by the carriers is given by
F ¼ q ðE þ v · BÞ
The Hall effect is the basis of widely used and sensitive instruments for measuring the intensity of magnetic
ﬁelds over a range of 10–5 to 2 · 106 A/m.

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

Time-Varying Magnetic Fields
In 1831, 11 years after Oersted demonstrated that a current produced a magnetic ﬁeld which could deﬂect a
compass needle, Faraday succeeded in showing the converse effect—that a magnetic ﬁeld could produce a
current. The reason for the delay between the two discoveries was that it is only when a magnetic ﬁeld is
changing that an emf is produced:
emf ¼  dF
dt V
FIGURE 15.2
Hall effect. A magnetic ﬁeld B applied to a block of semiconducting material through which a current I is
ﬂowing exerts a force F ¼ V · B on the current carriers (electrons or holes) and produces an electric charge on the right
face of the block. The charge is positive if the carriers are holes and negative if the carriers are electrons.

where F ¼ BS ¼ ﬂux density (in gauss) · area S. The time-changing ﬂux, dF/dt, can happen as a result of:
1. A changing magnetic ﬁeld within a stationary circuit
2. A circuit moving through a steady magnetic ﬁeld
3. A combination of 1 and 2
The electrical circuit may have N turns and then:
emf ¼ N dF
dt
We can write emf ¼ E : dL and in the presence of changing magnetic ﬁelds or a moving electrical circuit E : dL
is no longer required to be equal to 0 as it was for stationary ﬁelds and circuits.
Maxwell’s Equations
Because the ﬂux F can be writtenRB · ds we have emf ¼ E : dL ¼ –d/dt B : ds, and by using Stokes’ theorem:
ðH · EÞ · ds ¼ dB=dt ds
or
H · E ¼ dB=dt
That is, a spatially changing electric ﬁeld produces a time-changing magnetic ﬁeld. This is one of Maxwell’s
equations linking electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
By a similar argument it can be shown that:
H · H ¼ J þ dD=dt
This is another of Maxwell’s equations and shows a spatially changing magnetic ﬁeld produces a time-changing
electric ﬁeld. The latter dD/dt can be treated as an electric current which ﬂows through a dielectric, e.g., in a
capacitor, when an alternating potential is applied across the plates. This current is called the displacement
current to distinguish it from the conduction current which ﬂows in conductors. The conduction current
involves the movement of electrons from one electrode to the other through the conductor (usually a metal).
The displacement current involves no translation of electrons or holes but rather an alternating polarization
throughout the dielectric material which is between the plates of the capacitor.
From the last two equations we see a key conclusion of Maxwell: that in electromagnetic ﬁelds a time-
varying magnetic ﬁeld produces a spatially varying electric ﬁeld and a time-varying electric ﬁeld produces a
spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld.
Maxwell’s equations in point form, then, are
H · E ¼ dB=dt
H · H ¼ J þ dD=dt
H · D ¼ rv
H · B ¼ 0
These equations are supported by the following auxiliary equations:
D ¼ EEEEEE ðdisplacement ¼ permittivity · electric field intensityÞ

B ¼ mH ðflux density ¼ permeability · magnetic field intensityÞ
J ¼ sE ðcurrent density ¼ conductivity · electric field strengthÞ

The last two equations relate, respectively, the electric polarization P to the displacement D ¼ EEEEEoE and the
magnetic moment M to the ﬂux density B ¼ moH. They apply only to ‘‘linear’’ materials, i.e., those for which P
is linearly related to E and M to H. For magnetic materials we can say that nonlinear materials are usually of
greater practical interest.
Dia- and Paramagnetism
The phenomenon of magnetism arises ultimately from moving electrical charges (electrons). The movement
may be orbital around the nucleus or the other degree of freedom possessed by electrons which, by analogy
with the motion of the planets, is referred to as spin. In technologically important materials, i.e., ferromagnetics
and ferrimagnetics, spin is more important than orbital motion. Each arrow in Figure 15.3 represents the total
spin of an atom.
FIGURE 15.3
All matter consists of diamagnetic material (atoms having no permanent magnetic dipole moment) or
paramagnetic material (atoms having magnetic dipole moment). Paramagnetic materials may be further divided into
ferromagnetics, ferrimagnetics, and antiferromagnetics.
15-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

An atom may have a permanent magnetic moment, in which case it is referred to as belonging to a
paramagnetic material, or the atom may be magnetized only when in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, in which
case it is called diamagnetic. Diamagnetics are magnetized in the opposite direction to that of the applied
magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., they display negative susceptibility (a measure of the induced magnetization per unit of
applied magnetic ﬁeld). Paramagnetics are magnetized in the same direction as the applied magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.,
they have positive susceptibility. All atoms are diamagnetic by virtue of their having electrons. Some atoms are
also paramagnetic as well, but in this case they are called paramagnetics since paramagnetism is roughly a
hundred times stronger than diamagnetism and overwhelms it. Faraday discovered that paramagnetics are
attracted by a magnetic ﬁeld and move toward the region of maximum ﬁeld, whereas diamagnetics are repelled
and move toward a ﬁeld minimum.
The total magnetization of both paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials is zero in the absence of an
applied ﬁeld, i.e., they have zero remanence. Atomic paramagnetism is a necessary condition but not a
sufﬁcient condition for ferro- or ferrimagnetism, i.e., for materials having useful magnetic properties.
Ferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism
To develop technologically useful materials, we need an additional force that ensures that the spins of the
outermost (or almost outermost) electrons are mutually parallel. Slater showed that in iron, cobalt, and nickel
this could happen if the distance apart of the atoms (D) was more than 1.5 times the diameter of the 3d
electron shell (d). (These are the electrons, near the outside of atoms of iron, cobalt, and nickel, that are
responsible for the strong paramagnetic moment of the atoms. Paramagnetism of the atoms is an essential
prerequisite for ferro- or ferrimagnetism in a material.)
Slater’s result suggested that, of these metals, iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium should be ferromagnetic
at room temperature, while chromium and manganese should not be ferromagnetic. This is in accordance
with experiment. Gadolinium, one of the rare earth elements, is only weakly ferromagnetic in a cool room.
Chromium and manganese in the elemental form narrowly miss being ferromagnetic. However, when
manganese is alloyed with copper and aluminum (Cu61Mn24Al15) to form what is known as a Heusler alloy
[Crangle, 1962], it becomes ferromagnetic. The radius of the 3d electrons has not been changed by alloying,
but the atomic spacing has been increased by a factor of 1.53/1.47. This small change is sufﬁcient to make the
difference between positive exchange, parallel spins, and ferromagnetism and negative exchange, antiparallel
spins, and antiferromagnetism.
For all ferromagnetic materials there exists a temperature (the Curie temperature) above which the thermal
disordering forces are stronger than the exchange forces that cause the atomic spins to be parallel. From
Table 15.3 we see that in order of descending Curie temperature we have Co, Fe, Ni, Gd. From Figure 15.4 we
ﬁnd that this is also the order of descending values of the exchange integral, suggesting that high positive
values of the exchange integral are indicative of high Curie temperatures rather than high magnetic intensity in
ferromagnetic materials.
Negative values of exchange result in an antiparallel arrangement of the spins of adjacent atoms and in
antiferromagnetic materials (Figure 15.3). Until ﬁve years ago, it was true to say that antiferromagnetism had

no practical application. Thin ﬁlms on antiferromagnetic materials are now used to provide the bias ﬁeld
which is used to linearize the response of some magnetoresistive reading heads in magnetic disk drives.
Ferrimagnetism, also illustrated in Figure 15.3, is much more widely used. It can be produced as soft, i.e., low
coercivity, ferrites for use in magnetic recording and reading heads or in the core of transformers operating at
frequencies up to tens of megahertz. High-coercivity, single-domain particles (which are discussed later) are
used in very large quantities to make magnetic recording tapes and ﬂexible disks g-Fe2O3 and cobalt-
impregnated iron oxides and to make barium ferrite, the most widely used material for permanent magnets.
Intrinsic Magnetic Properties
Intrinsic magnetic properties are those properties that depend on the type of atoms and their composition and
crystal structure, but not on the previous history of a particular sample. Examples of intrinsic magnetic
properties are the saturation magnetization, Curie temperature, magnetocrystallic anisotropy, and magneto-
striction.
Extrinsic magnetic properties depend on type, composition, and structure, but they also depend on the
previous history of the sample, e.g., heat treatment. Examples of extrinsic magnetic properties include the
technologically important properties of remanent magnetization, coercivity, and permeability. These
properties can be substantially altered by heat treatment, quenching, cold-working the sample, or otherwise
changing the size of the magnetic particle.
A ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material, on being heated, suffers a reduction of its magnetization (per
unit mass, i.e., s, and per unit volume, M). The slope of the curve of Ms vs. T increases with increasing
temperature as shown in Figure 15.5. This ﬁgure represents the conﬂict between the ordering tendency of the
exchange interaction and the disordering effect of increasing temperature. At the Curie temperature, the order
no longer exists and we have a paramagnetic material. The change from ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic
materials to paramagnetic is completely reversible on reducing the temperature to its initial value. Curie
temperatures are always lower than melting points.
A single crystal of iron has the body-centered structure at room temperature. If the magnetization as a
function of applied magnetic ﬁeld is measured, the shape of the curve is found to depend on the direction of
the ﬁeld. This phenomenon is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Iron has body-centered structure at room
temperature, and the ‘‘easy’’ directions of magnetization are those directions parallel to the cube edges [100],

[010], and [001] or, collectively. The hard direction of magnetization for iron is the body diagonal [111].
At higher temperatures, the anisotropy becomes smaller and disappears above 300–C.
Nickel crystals (face-centered cubic) have an easy direction of [111] and a hard direction of [100]. Cobalt
has the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure and the hexagonal axis is the easy direction at room
temperature.
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy plays a very important part in determining the coercivity of ferro- or ferri-
magnetic materials, i.e., the ﬁeld value at which the direction of magnetization is reversed.
Many magnetic materials change dimensions on becoming magnetized: the phenomenon is known as
magnetostriction and can be positive, i.e., length increases, or negative. Magnetostriction plays an important
role in determining the preferred direction of magnetization of soft, i.e., low Hc, ﬁlms such as those of alloys of
nickel and iron, known as permalloy.
The origin of both magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction is spin–orbit coupling. The
magnitude of the magnetization of the ﬁlm is controlled by the electron spin as usual, but the preferred
direction of that magnetization with respect to the crystal lattice is determined by the electron orbits which are
large enough to interact with the atomic structure of the ﬁlm.
Extrinsic Magnetic Properties
Extrinsic magnetic properties are those properties that depend not only on the shape and size of the sample, but
also on the shape and size of the magnetic constituents of the sample. For example, if we measure the hysteresis
loop like the one shown in Figure 15.6 on a disk-shaped sample punched from a magnetic recording tape, the
result will depend not only on the diameter and thickness of the disk coating but also on the distribution of
shapes and sizes of the magnetic particles within the disk. They display hysteresis individually and collectively.
For a soft magnetic material, i.e., one that might be used to make the laminations of a transformer, the
dependence of magnetization, M, on the applied magnetic ﬁeld, H, is also complex. Having once left a point
described by the coordinates (H1, M1), it is not immediately clear how one might return to that point.
Alloys of nickel and iron, in which the nickel content is the greater, can be capable of a reversal of
magnetization by the application of a magnetic ﬁeld, H, which is weaker than the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
(0.5–Oe, 40–A/m) by a factor of ﬁve. (To avoid confusion caused by the geomagnetic ﬁeld it would be
necessary to screen the sample, for example, by surrounding it by a shield of equally soft material or by
measuring the earth’s ﬁeld and applying a ﬁeld which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the
earth’s ﬁeld in order to cancel its effects.)

Curie temperature, Yc.

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

The magnetization of the sample in zero ﬁeld may be macroscopically zero, but locally the material may be
magnetized virtually to the saturation state. As shown in Figure 15.6, which shows a greatly simpliﬁed domain
structure, the net magnetization at the center of the loop is zero because the magnetization of the four
‘‘domains’’ cancels in pairs. A domain is a region (not necessarily square or even of a regular shape, although
the shape often is regular in Ni–Fe thin ﬁlms or sheets) over which the magnetization is constant in magnitude
and direction. Thus, the sample in Figure 15.6 consists of four domains, initially separated from each other by
‘‘domain walls.’’ If a magnetic ﬁeld is applied in the direction of þH, that domain will grow whose direction of
magnetization is closest to the ﬁeld direction and the domains will shrink if their magnetization is opposed to
the ﬁeld. For small applied ﬁelds, the movement of the walls is reversible, i.e., on reducing the applied ﬁeld to
zero, the original domain conﬁguration will be obtained. Beyond a certain ﬁeld the movement of the walls is
irreversible, and eventually near the knee of the magnetization curve all the domain walls have been swept
away by the applied ﬁeld. The sample is not yet in the saturated state since the direction of M is not quite the
same as the direction of the applied ﬁeld. However, a small increase in the strength of the applied ﬁeld ﬁnally
achieves the saturated state by rotating the magnetization of the whole sample into the ﬁeld direction.
On removing the applied ﬁeld, the sample does not retrace the magnetization curve, and when the applied
ﬁeld is zero, we can see that a considerable amount of magnetization remains, Mr. Appropriately, this is
referred to as the remanent state, and Mr is the remanent magnetization. By reversing the original direction of
the applied ﬁeld, domains reappear and the magnetization is eventually reduced to zero at the coercive ﬁeld,
Hc. It should be noticed that, at Hc, although the net magnetization is clearly zero, the individual domains may
be magnetized in directions that are different from those at the starting point. Figure 15.6 shows an incomplete
hysteresis loop. If the ﬁeld H were increased beyond þHc the loop would be completed.
The differences between ideally magnetically soft materials (used in transformers and magnetic read/write
heads) and magnetically hard materials (used in permanent magnets and in recording tapes and disks) are as
follows:
Magnetically soft materials:
Hc0;
Mr0;
Ms high value
Magnetically hard materials:
Hc high value;
Mr=MsðsquarenessÞ;
Ms high value
Examples are given in Table 15.4.
It is noticeable that the differences between hard and soft magnetic materials are conﬁned to the extrinsic
properties, Mr, Hc, and permeability, m. The latter is related to M and H as follows:
BðGÞ ¼ H ðOeÞ þ 4pM ðemu=ccÞ
m ¼ B=H ¼ 1 þ 4pk ðcgs unitsÞ
FIGURE 15.6
In soft magnetic materials domains form such that the total magnetization is zero. By applying small

or
B ðWb=mÞ2 ¼ m0ðH A=m þ M A=mÞ
¼ m0m1H ¼ mH ðSI unitsÞ
Domain walls form in order to minimize the magnetic energy of the sample. The magnetic energy is mH2/8p
cgs units or 1/2mH2 J/m3 (SI units) and clearly depends on H, the magnetic ﬁeld emanating from the sample.
In the initial domain conﬁguration shown in Figure 15.6, there is no net magnetization of the sample and thus
no substantial H exists outside the sample and the magnetostatic energy is zero. Thus, the establishment of
domains reduces the energy associated with H but it increases the energy needed to establish domain walls
within the sample. A compromise is reached in which domain walls are formed until the establishment of one
more wall would increase, rather than decrease, the total magnetic energy of the sample.
The wall energy depends on the area of the wall, i.e., L2, while the energy associated with the external
magnetic ﬁeld depends on L3, the volume of the sample. Clearly, as the size of single particles becomes small,
terms in L2 are more important than terms in L3, and so for small magnetic particles, the formation of domain
walls may not be energetically feasible and a single-domain particle results. These are found in the particles of
iron oxide, cobalt-modiﬁed iron oxide, chromium dioxide, iron, or barium ferrite, which are used to make
magnetic recording tapes, and in barium ferrite, samarium cobalt, and neodymium iron boron, which are
used to make powerful permanent magnets. In the latter cases, the very high coercivities are caused by domain
walls being pinned at grain boundaries between the main phase grains and ﬁnely precipitated secondary
phases. This is an example of nucleation-controlled coercivity.
The amount of available energy that can be stored in a permanent magnet is the area of the largest rectangle
that can be drawn in the second quadrant of the B vs. H hysteresis loop. The energy product has grown
remarkably by a factor of about 50 since 1900 (Strnat, 1986). We see from the graph in Figure 15.7 of intrinsic
coercive force, i.e., the coercive force obtained from the graph of M vs. H (in contrast to the smaller coercive
force obtained by plotting B vs. H), that increases in Hc (rather than increases in Mr) have been responsible for
almost all the improvement in the energy product.
The key attributes of technologically important magnetic materials are:
1. Large, spontaneous atomic magnetic moments
2. Large, positive exchange integrals
3. Magnetic anisotropy and heterogeneity which are small for soft magnetic materials and large for hard
magnetic materials

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

In single-domain materials, the magnetic particles are so small that reversal of the magnetization can only
occur by rotation of the magnetization vector. This rotation can be resisted by combinations of three anisotro-
pies: crystalline anisotropy, shape anisotropy, and magnetoelastic anisotropy (which depends on the magneto-
strictive properties of the material).
Crystalline Anisotropy
Crystalline anisotropy arises from the existence of easy and hard directions of magnetization within the crystal
structure of the material. For example, in iron the {100} directions are easy directions while the {111}
directions are hard. In nickel crystals the reverse is true. In cobalt the hexagonal {00.1} directions are easy and
the {10.0} directions in the basal plane are hard.
Hard and easy directions in crystalline materials come about as a result of spin–orbit coupling. The spin, as
usual, determines the occurrence of ferro- or ferrimagnetization, while the orbital motion of the electrons
(3d in the case of Fe, Co, and Ni) responds to the structure of the crystal lattice.
The maximum value of coercivity resulting from crystalline anisotropy is given by Hc ¼ 2K1/Ms, where K1 is
the ﬁrst magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant and Ms is the saturation magnetization.
Shape Anisotropy
A spherical particle has no shape anisotropy, i.e., all directions are equally easy (or hard). For particles (having
low crystalline anisotropy) of any other shape, the longest dimension is the easy direction and the shortest
dimension is the hardest direction of magnetization. Thus, a needle-shaped (acicular) particle will tend to be
magnetized along the long dimension, whereas a particle in the form of a disk will have the axis of the disk as
its hard direction, while any direction in the plane of the disk will be equally easy (assuming that shape is the
dominant anisotropy).

and in intrinsic coercivity as a function of time.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

For an acicular particle, the maximum value of the particle’s switching ﬁeld is (Stoner and Wohlfarth, 1948):
Hc ¼ ðNb  NaÞ Ms
where Nb is the demagnetizing factor in the shorter dimension and Na is the factor for the long axis of the
particle. When the ratio b/a !1, then:
Na ! 0
Nb ! 2p

Na þ Nb þ Nc  4p
and Hc for iron . 10,000 Oe (7.95 · 105 A/m), higher than has been achieved in the laboratory for single-
domain iron particles. Particles of iron having Hc < 2000 Oe are widely used in high-quality audio and video
tapes.
The reason for the discrepancy is that the simplest single-domain model makes the assumption that the
spins on all the atoms in a particle rotate in the same direction and at the same time, i.e., are coherent. This
seems to be improbable since switching may begin at different places in the single-domain particle at the
same time. Jacobs and Bean (1955) proposed an incoherent mode, fanning, in which different segments on a
longitudinal chain of atoms rotate in opposite directions. Shtrikman and Treves (1959) introduced another
incoherent mode, buckling. These incoherent modes of magnetization reversal within single-domain
particles not only predicted values of coercivity closer to the observed values, but also they could explain
why the observed coercivity values for single-domain particles increased with decreasing particle size
(Bate, 1980).
Shape anisotropy also plays an important role in determining the magnetization direction in thin magnetic
ﬁlms. It, of course, favors magnetization in the ﬁlm plane.
Magnetoelastic Anisotropy
Spin–orbit coupling is also responsible for magnetostriction (the increase or decrease of the dimensions of a
body on becoming magnetized or demagnetized). The magnetostriction coefﬁcient ls ¼ fractional change of a
dimension of the body. It can be positive or negative, and it varies with changes in the direction and
magnitude of the applied stress (or internal stress) and of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. It is highly sensitive to
composition, to structure, and to the previous history of the sample. The maximum coercivity is given by the
formula Hc ¼ 3lsT/Ms where ls is the saturation magnetostriction coefﬁcient, T is the tension, and Ms
the saturation magnetization. Magnetostriction has been put to practical use in the generation of sonar waves
for the detection of schools of ﬁsh or submarines.
For samples made of single-domain particles, the maximum coercivity for three ferromagnetic metals and
one ferrimagnetic oxide (widely used in magnetic recording) is calculated using the preceding formula.
Table 15.5 shows maximum coercivity (Oe) for single-domain particles (coherent rotation).
The assumption is made that all the spins rotate so that they remain parallel at all times. This is known
as coherent rotation. In the case of g-Fe2O3, an incoherent mode of reversal probably occurs since the
maximum observed coercivity is only 350 Oe. Several incoherent modes have been proposed, e.g., chain-
of-spheres fanning (Jacobs and Bean, 1955), curling (Shtrikman and Treves, 1959). Their characteristics

and differences are discussed by Bate (1980). The coercivity of particles of g-Fe2O3 is increased (in order
to make recording tapes of extended frequency response) by precipitating cobalt hydroxide on the surface
of the particles. After gentle warming, the cobalt is incorporated on the surface of the particles and
increases the coercivity to 650 Oe (51 : 73 kA/m).
Figure 15.8 illustrates two additional extrinsic magnetic properties of importance. They are the remanence
coercivity, Hr, and the switching ﬁeld distribution (SFD). These are of particular importance in magnetic
particles used in magnetic tapes (audio, video, or data) or magnetic disks. The coercivity, Hc, of a magnetic
material is the value of the magnetic ﬁeld (the major loop) at which M ¼ 0. However, if the applied ﬁeld is
allowed to go to zero, a small magnetization remains. It is necessary to increase the applied ﬁeld from Hc . Hr
(Figure 15.8) to achieve Mr ¼ 0. Hr is the remanence coercivity and is more relevant than is Hc in discussing the
writing process in magnetic recording since it corresponds to the center of the remanent magnetization
transition on the recording medium.
Particles, for example, in a magnetic recording do not all reverse their magnetization at the same ﬁeld; there
is a distribution of switching ﬁelds, which can be found by differentiating M with respect to H around the
point Hc. The result is shown as the broken curve on Figure 15.8, where the SFD ¼ DH/Hc, DH being the
width at half the maximum of the curve. Typically, SFD ¼ 0.2 to 0.3 for a high-quality particulate medium and
smaller than this for thin-ﬁlm recording media.
Figure 15.8 also shows the construction used to ﬁnd the parameter S*. The quantity 1 – S* is found to be
very close to DH/Hc, and it is quicker to evaluate. Either of these parameters can be used to determine the
distribution of switching ﬁelds, small values of which are required to achieve high recording densities.
Amorphous Magnetic Materials
Before 1960, all the known ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials were crystalline. Because the occurrence of these
magnetic states is known to depend on short-range interaction between atoms, there is no reason why
amorphous materials (which have only short-range order) should not have useful magnetic properties. This
was found to be true in 1960, when thin, amorphous ribbons of Au81Si19 were made by rapidly cooling the
molten alloy through the melting point and the lower glass transition temperature. Because there is always at
least one crystalline phase more stable than the amorphous state, the problem is to invent a production
method that yields the amorphous phase rather than the crystalline one.
FIGURE 15.8
The switching ﬁeld distribution (SFD) for a magnetic recording medium can be obtained in two
ways: (1) SFD ¼ DH/Hc or (2) SFD ¼ 1 – S*.

Most methods involve cooling the molten mixture so rapidly that there is insufﬁcient time for crystals to
form. Cooling rates of 105 to 106 degrees per second are needed and can be achieved in several ways:
1. Pouring the molten mixture from a silica crucible onto the edge of a rapidly rotating copper wheel. This
yields a ribbon of the amorphous alloy, typically 1 mm wide and 25 mm thick.
2. Depositing a thin ﬁlm from a metal vapor or a solution of metal ions.
3. Irradiating a thin sample of the metal with high-energy particles.
Once an amorphous alloy is formed, it will remain indeﬁnitely in the glassy state at room temperature. The
problem is that only thin ﬁlms are obtained, and large areas are required to make, for example, the core of a
transformer.
There are three main groups of amorphous ﬁlms:
1. Metal-metalloid alloys, e.g., Au81Si19
2. Late transition–early transition metal alloys, e.g., Ni60Nb40
3. Simple metal alloys, e.g., Cu65Al35
When normal metals freeze, crystallization begins at a ﬁxed temperature, the liquidus, Te. In amorphous alloys
conﬁgurational freezing occurs at a lower temperature, the glass temperature, Tg, which is not as well deﬁned as Te.
There is an abrupt increase in the time required for the rearrangement of the atoms, from 10–12 sec for liquids to
105 sec (a day) for glasses. Not surprisingly, this increase in atomic rearrangement time is associated with an
abrupt increase in viscosity, from 10–2 poise for liquids, e.g., water or mercury, to 1015 poise for glasses.
The principal difference between magnetic glasses and ferromagnetic alloys is that the glasses are completely
isotropic (all directions of magnetization are very easy directions), and consequently, considering only the
magnetic properties, soft amorphous alloys are almost ideally suited for use in the core of power transformers
or magnetic recording heads, where almost zero remanence and coercivity are desired at frequencies up to
megahertz. The limit on their performance seems to be the magnetic anisotropy which arises from strains
generated during the manufacturing process.
When an amorphous material is required to store energy (as in a permanent magnet) or information (as in
magnetic bubbles or thermomagneto-optic ﬁlms), it must have magnetic anisotropy. This is generally
produced by applying a magnetic ﬁeld at high temperatures to the amorphous material. The ﬁeld and
temperature must be high enough to allow a local rearrangement of atoms to take place in order to create the
desired degree of magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
Amorphous materials will apparently play increasingly important roles as magnetic materials. To accelerate
their use, we need to have answers to the questions ‘‘What governs the formation of amorphous materials?’’
and ‘‘What is the origin of their anisotropy and magnetostriction?’’.

Magnetic Recording
Mark H. Kryder
Magnetic recording is used in a wide variety of applications and formats, ranging from relatively low-density,
low-cost ﬂoppy disk drives and audio recorders to high-density videocassette recorders, digital audio tape
recorders, computer tape drives, rigid disk drives, and instrumentation recorders. The storage density of this
technology has been advancing at a very rapid pace. With a storage density exceeding 1 Gbit/in.2, magnetic
recording media today can store the equivalent of about 50,000 pages of text on one square inch. This is more
than 500,000 times the storage density on the RAMAC, which was introduced in 1957 by IBM as the ﬁrst disk
drive for storage of digital information. The original Seagate 5.25-in. magnetic disk drive, introduced in 1980,
stored just 5 Mbytes. Today, instead of storing megabytes, 5.25-in. drives store tens of gigabytes, and drives as
small as 2.5 in. store over a gigabyte.
This astounding rate of progress shows no sign of slowing. Fundamental limits to magnetic recording
density are still several orders of magnitude away, and recent product announcements and laboratory
demonstrations indicate the industry is accelerating the rate of progress rather than approaching practical
limits. Recently IBM demonstrated the feasability of storing information at a density of 3 Gbit/in.2 (Tsang et al.,
1996). Similar advances can also be expected in audio and video recording.
Fundamentals of Magnetic Recording
Although magnetic recording is practiced in a wide variety of formats and serves a wide variety of applications,
the fundamental principles by which it operates are similar in all cases. The fundamental magnetic recording
conﬁguration is illustrated in Figure 15.9. The recording head consists of a toroidally shaped core of soft
magnetic material with a few turns of conductor around it. The magnetic medium below the head could be
either tape or disk, and the substrate could be either ﬂexible (for tape and ﬂoppy disks) or rigid (for rigid
disks). To record on the medium, current is applied to the coil around the core of the head, causing the high-
permeability magnetic core to magnetize. Because of the gap in the recording head, magnetic ﬂux emanates
from the head and penetrates the medium. If the ﬁeld produced by the head is sufﬁcient to overcome the
coercive force of the medium, the medium will be magnetized by the head ﬁeld. Thus, a representation of the
current waveform applied to the head is stored in the magnetization pattern in the medium.
15-16
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Readout of previously recorded information is typically accomplished by using the head to sense the
magnetic stray ﬁelds produced by the recorded patterns in the medium. The recorded patterns in the medium
cause magnetic stray ﬁelds to emanate from the medium and to ﬂow through the core of the head. Thus, if the
medium is moved with respect to the head, the ﬂux passing through the coil around the head will change in a
manner which is representative of the recorded magnetization pattern in the medium. By Faraday’s law of
induction, a voltage representative of the recorded information is thus induced in the coil.
The Recording Process
During recording the head is used to produce large magnetic ﬁelds which magnetize the medium. It was
shown by Karlqvist (1954) that, in the case where the track width and length of the poles along the gap are
both large compared to the gap length, the ﬁelds produced by a recording head could be described by:
Hx ¼ NI

#
ð15:1bÞ
where Hx and Hy are the longitudinal and perpendicular components of ﬁeld, as indicated by the coordinates
in Figure 15.10, N is the number of turns on the head, I is the current driving the head, and g is the gap width
of the head. In this approximation, the contours of equal longitudinal ﬁeld are described by circles which
intersect the gap corners as shown in Figure 15.10.
In digital or saturation recording, the recording head is driven with sufﬁciently large currents that a portion
of the recording medium is driven into saturation. However, because of the gradient in the head ﬁelds, other
portions of the medium see ﬁelds less than those required for saturation. This is illustrated in Figure 15.10
where the contours for three different longitudinal ﬁelds are drawn. In this ﬁgure Hcr is the remanence
coercivity or the ﬁeld required to produce zero remanent magnetization in the medium after it was saturated
in the opposite direction, and H1 and H2 are ﬁelds which would produce negative and positive remanent
magnetization, respectively. Note that the head ﬁeld gradient is the sharpest near the pole tips of the head.
This means that smaller head-to-medium spacing and thinner medium both lead to narrower transitions
being recorded.

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

Modeling the recording process involves convolving the head ﬁeld contours with the very nonlinear and
hysteretic magnetic properties of the recording medium. A typical M–H hysteresis loop for a longitudinal
magnetic recording medium is shown in Figure 15.11. Whether the medium has positive or negative
magnetization depends upon not only the magnetic ﬁeld applied but the past history of the magnetization. If
the medium was previously saturated at –Ms, then when the magnetic ﬁeld H is reduced to zero, the remanent
magnetization will be –Mr; however, if it was previously saturated at þMs, then the remanent magnetization
would be þMr. Similarly, if the medium was initially saturated to –Ms, then magnetized by a ﬁeld þH1, and
ﬁnally allowed to go to a remanent state, the magnetization would go to value M1. This hysteretic behavior is
the basis for the use of the medium for long-term storage of information but makes the recording process
highly nonlinear.

An additional complicating factor in determining the actual recorded pattern is the demagnetizing ﬁeld of
the medium itself. As shown in Figure 15.9, transitions in the recorded magnetization direction produce
effective magnetostatic charge given by
rM ¼ H · !
M
ð15:2Þ
which in turn results in demagnetizing ﬁelds. The demagnetizing ﬁelds outside the medium are what is sensed
by the head during readback, but demagnetizing ﬁelds also exist inside the medium and act to alter the total
ﬁeld seen by the medium during the recording process from that of the head ﬁeld alone.
Taking into account the head ﬁeld gradients, the nonlinear M–H loop characteristics of the medium and the
demagnetizing ﬁelds, Williams and Comstock (1971) developed a model for the recording process. This model
predicts the width of a recorded transition, in a material with a square hysteresis loop, to be
a ¼

where d is the medium thickness, d is the head-medium spacing, Mr is the remanent magnetization of the
medium, and Hc is the coercivity of the medium. That the transition widens with the product Mr : d is a result
of the fact that the demagnetizing ﬁelds increase linearly with this quantity. Similarly, the transition narrows as
Hc is increased, because with high coercivity, the medium can resist the transition broadening due to the
demagnetizing ﬁelds. The increase in transition width with d is due to the fact that a poorer head ﬁeld gradient
is obtained with larger head-medium spacing.
The nonlinearities of the recording process can be largely removed by a technique referred to as ac bias
recording. This is frequently used in analog recording in audio and video recorders. In this technique, a high-
frequency ac bias is added to the signal to be recorded. This ac bias signal is ramped from a value much larger
than the coercivity of the medium to zero. This removes the hysteretic behavior of the medium and causes it to
assume a magnetization state which represents the minimum energy state determined by the amount of ﬁeld
produced by the signal to be recorded.
The Readback Process
As opposed to the recording process, the readback process can usually be modeled as a linear process. This is
because the changes in magnetization which occur in either the head or the medium during readback are
typically small.
The most common way to model the readback process is to use the principle of reciprocity, which
states that the ﬂux produced by the head through a cross-section of an element of the medium,
normalized by the number of ampere turns of current driving the head, is equal to the ﬂux produced in
the head by the element of medium, normalized by the equivalent current required to produce the
magnetization of that element. For a magnetic recording head, which produces the longitudinal ﬁeld
Hx(x,y) when driven by NI ampere turns of current, this principle leads to the following expression for the
voltage induced in the head by a recording medium with magnetization M(x,y) and moving with velocity
v relative to the head:

This expression shows that the readback voltage induced in the recording head is linearly dependent upon

velocity. The linearity of the readback process ensures that analog recordings such as those recorded on audio
or video tapes are faithfully reproduced.
Magnetic Recording Media
A wide variety of magnetic recording media are available today. Different applications require different media,
but furthermore, in many cases the same application will be able to utilize a variety of different competitive
media.
Just a decade ago, essentially all recording media consisted of ﬁne acicular magnetic particles embedded in a
polymer and coated onto either ﬂexible substrates such as mylar for ﬂoppy disks and tapes or onto rigid
aluminum-alloy substrates for rigid disks. Today, although such particulate media are still widely used for tape
and ﬂoppy disks, thin-ﬁlm media have almost entirely taken over the rigid disk business, and metal-
evaporated thin-ﬁlm media has been introduced into the tape marketplace. Furthermore, many new particle
types have been introduced.
The most common particulate recording media today are g-Fe2O3, Co surface-modiﬁed g-Fe2O3, CrO2, and
metal particle media. All of these particles are acicular in shape with aspect ratios on the order of 5 or 10 to 1.
The particles are sufﬁciently small that it is energetically most favorable for them to remain in a single-domain
saturated state. Because of demagnetizing effects caused by the acicular shape, the magnetization prefers to
align along the long axis of the particle.
As was noted in the discussion of Equation (15.3), to achieve higher recording densities requires media with
higher coercivity. The coercivity of a particle is determined by the ﬁeld required to cause the magnetization to
switch by 180–. If the magnetization remained in a single-domain state during the switching process, then the
coercivity should be given by
Hc ¼ ðNa  NbÞMs
ð15:5Þ
where Na and Nb are the demagnetizing factors in the directions transverse and parallel to the particle axis,
respectively. In practice the coercivity is measured to be less than this. This has been explained as being a result
of the fact the magnetization does not remain uniform during the switching process, but switches
inhomogeneously (White, 1984). In addition to the effects which the shape anisotropy of the particles has on
the coercivity, crystalline anisotropy can also be used to control coercivity.
The coercivity of the medium which is made from the particles is determined by the distribution of
coercivities of the particles from which it is made, their orientation in the medium relative to the ﬁelds from
the head, and their interactions among each other. The coercivities of a variety of particulate recording media
are summarized in Table 15.6.
Although coercivity is indeed an important parameter for magnetic recording media, it is by no means the
only one. Particle size affects the medium noise because, at any time, the head is sensing a ﬁxed volume of
the medium. Because the particles are quantized and there are statistical variations in their switching behavior,
the medium power signal-to-noise ratio varies linearly with the number of particles contained in that volume.
To reduce particulate medium noise, it is therefore generally desirable to use small particles.
There is a limit, however, to how small particles may be made and still remain stable. When the thermal
energy kT is comparable in magnitude to the energy required to switch a particle, M : Hc, the particle becomes
unstable and may switch because of thermal excitation. This phenomenon is known as superparamagnetism
and can lead to decay of recorded magnetization patterns over time.
The remanent magnetization of a medium is important because it directly affects the signal level during
readback as shown by Equation (15.4). The remanent magnetizations of several particulate media are listed
in Table 15.6. Obtaining high remanent magnetization in particulate media requires the use of particles with
high saturation magnetization and a high-volume packing fraction of particles in the polymer binder.
Obtaining a high-volume packing fraction of particles in the binder, however, can lead to nonuniform
distributions of particles and agglomerates of many particles, which switch together, also causing noise
during readback.

Generally, then, to obtain good high-density particulate recording media it is desired to have adequate
coercivity (to achieve the required recording density), small particles (for low noise), with a very narrow
switching ﬁeld distribution (to obtain a narrow transition), to have them oriented along the direction of
recording (to obtain a large remanence), and to have them uniformly dispersed (to obtain low modulation
noise), with high packing density (to obtain large signals).
Thin-ﬁlm recording media generally have excellent magnetic properties for high-density recording.
Because they are nearly 100% dense (voids at the grain boundaries reduce the density somewhat), they
can be made to have the highest possible magnetization. Because of their high magnetization, they can be
made extremely thin and still provide adequate signal during readback. This helps narrow the recorded
transition since the head ﬁeld gradient is sharper for thinner media, as was discussed in reference to
Figure 15.10.
Thin-ﬁlm media can also be made extremely smooth. To achieve the smallest possible head-to-medium
spacing and therefore the sharpest head ﬁeld gradient and the least spacing loss, smooth media are required.
The coercivity of thin-ﬁlm media can also be made very high. In volume production today are media with
coercivities of 160 kA/m; however, media with coercivities to 250 kA/m have been made and appear promising
(Velu and Lambeth, 1992). Such high coercivities are adequate to achieve more than an order of magnitude
higher recording density than today.
Numerical models indicate that noise in thin-ﬁlm media increases when the grains in polycrystalline ﬁlms
are strongly exchange coupled (Zhu and Bertram, 1988). Exchange coupled ﬁlms tend to exhibit zigzag
transitions, which produce considerable jitter in the transition position relative to the location where the
record current in the head goes through zero. A variety of experimental studies have indicated that the
introduction of nonmagnetic elements which segregate to the grain boundaries and careful control of
the sputtering conditions to achieve a porous microstructure at the grain boundaries reduce such transition
jitter (Chen and Yamashita, 1988).

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

Magnetic Recording Heads
Early recording heads consisted of toroids of magnetically soft ferrites, such as NiZn–ferrite and MnZn–ferrite,
with a few turns of wire around them. For high-density recording applications, however, ferrite can no longer
be used, because the saturation magnetization of ferrite is limited to about 400 kA/m. Saturation of the pole
tips of a ferrite head begins to occur when the deep gap ﬁeld in the head approaches one-half the saturation
magnetization of the ferrite. Because the ﬁelds seen by a medium are one-half to one-quarter the deep gap
ﬁeld, media with coercivities above about 80 kA/m cannot be reliably written with a ferrite head. High-density
thin-ﬁlm disk media, metal particle media, and metal evaporated media, therefore, cannot be written with a
ferrite head.
Magnetically soft alloys of metals such as Permalloy (NiFe) and Sendust (FeAlSi) have saturation magneti-
zations on the order of 800 kA/m, about twice that of ferrites, but because they are metallic may suffer from
eddy current losses when operated at high frequencies. To overcome the limitations imposed by eddy currents,
they are used in layers thinner than a skin depth at their operating frequency. To prevent saturation of the
ferrite heads, the high magnetization metals are applied to the pole faces of the ferrite, making a so-called
metal-in-gap or MiG recording head, as shown in Figure 15.12. Since the corners of the pole faces are the ﬁrst
parts of a ferrite head to saturate, the high magnetization metals enable these MiG heads to be operated to
nearly twice the ﬁeld to which a ferrite head can be operated. Because the layer of metal is thin, it can
furthermore be less than a skin depth, and eddy current losses do not limit performance at high frequencies.
Yet another solution to the saturation problem of ferrite heads is to use thin-ﬁlm heads. Thin-ﬁlm heads are
made of Permalloy and are therefore metallic, but the ﬁlms are made sufﬁciently thin that they are thinner
than the skin depth and, consequently, the heads operate well at high frequencies. A diagram of a thin-ﬁlm
head is shown in Figure 15.13. It consists of a bottom yoke of Permalloy, some insulating layers, a spiral
conductor, and a top yoke of Permalloy, which is joined to the bottom yoke at the back gap but separated from
it by a thin insulator at the recording gap. These thin-ﬁlm heads are made using photolithography and
microfabrication techniques similar to those used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. The thin pole
tips of these heads actually sharpen the head ﬁeld function and, consequently, the pulse shape produced by
an isolated transition, although at the expense of some undershoot, as illustrated in Figure 15.14.

Because thin-ﬁlm heads are made by photolithographic techniques, they can be made extremely small and to
have low inductance. This, too, helps extend the frequency of operation.
A relatively new head which is now being used for readback of information in high-density recording is the
magnetoresistive (MR) head. MR heads are based on the phenomenon of magnetoresistance, in which the
electrical resistance of a magnetic material is dependent upon the direction of magnetization in the material
relative to the direction of current ﬂow. An unshielded MR head is depicted in Figure 15.15. Current ﬂows in
one end of the head and out the other. The resistivity of Permalloy from which the head is made varies as
r ¼ ro þ Dr cos2y

Magnetism and Magnetic Fields

where y is the angle which the magnetization in the Permalloy makes relative to the direction of current ﬂow,
ro is the isotropic resistivity, and Dr is the magnetoresistivity. When the recording medium with a changing
magnetization pattern moves under the MR head, the stray ﬁelds from the medium cause a change in the
direction of magnetization and, consequently, a change in resistance in the head. With a constant current
source driving the head, the head will therefore exhibit a change in voltage across its terminals.
Magnetoresistive heads are typically more sensitive than inductive heads and therefore produce larger signal
amplitudes during readback. The increased sensitivity and the fact that the read head is independent of the
write head can be used to make a write/read head combination in which the write head writes a wider track
than the read head senses. Thus, adjacent track interference is reduced during the readback process.
Another advantage of the MR head is that it senses magnetic ﬂux f, not the time rate of change of ﬂux
d(f)/dt as an inductive head does. Consequently, whereas the inductive head output voltage is dependent
upon the head-to-medium velocity as was shown by Equation (15.4), the output voltage of an MR head is
independent of velocity.
Conclusions
Magnetic recording today is used in a wide variety of formats for a large number of applications. Formats
range from tape, which has the highest volumetric packing density and lowest cost per bit stored, to rigid
disks, which provide fast access to a large volume of data. Applications include computer data storage, audio
and video recording, and collecting data from scientiﬁc instruments.
The technology has increased storage density by more than a factor of 1,000,000 over the past 35 years since
it was ﬁrst used in a disk format for computer data storage; however, fundamental limits, set by super-
paramagnetism, are estimated yet to be a factor of more than 1000 from where we are today. Furthermore,

recent product announcements and developments in research labs suggest that the rate of progress is
likely to accelerate. Storage densities of over 5 Gbit/in.2 are likely by the end of this decade and densities of
100 Gbit/in.2 appear likely in the early twenty-ﬁrst century.

Matthew N.O. Sadiku
This section summarizes the basic principles of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in space. The
principles essentially state how the characteristics of the Earth and the atmosphere affect the propagation of
EM waves. Understanding such principles is of practical interest to communication system engineers.
Engineers cannot competently apply formulas or models for communication system design without an
adequate knowledge of the propagation issue.
Propagation of an EM wave may be regarded as a means of transferring energy or information from one
point (a transmitter) to another (a receiver). EM wave propagation is achieved through guided structures such
as transmission lines and waveguides or through space. Wave propagation through waveguides and microstrip
lines will be treated in Section ‘‘Waveguides’’. In this section, our major focus is on EM wave propagation in
space and the power resident in the wave.
For a clear understanding of the phenomenon of EM wave propagation, it is expedient to break the
discussion of propagation effects into categories represented by four broad frequency intervals (Collin,
1985):
. Very low frequencies (VLF), 3 to 30 kHz
. Low-frequency (LF) band, 30 to 300 kHz
. High-frequency (HF) band, 3 to 30 MHz
. Above 50 MHz
In the ﬁrst range, a wave propagates as in a waveguide, using the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere as
boundaries. Attenuation is comparatively low, and hence VLF propagation is useful for long-distance
worldwide telegraphy and submarine communication. In the second frequency range, the availability of
increased bandwidth makes standard AM broadcasting possible. Propagation in this band is by means of
surface waves due to the presence of the ground. The third range is useful for long-range broadcasting
services via sky wave reﬂection and refraction by the ionosphere. Basic problems in this band include
ﬂuctuations in the ionosphere and a limited usable frequency range. Frequencies above 50 MHz allow
for line-of-sight space wave propagation, FM radio and TV channels, radar and navigation systems, and
so on. In this band, due consideration must be given to reﬂection from the ground, refraction by
16-1

the troposphere, scattering by atmospheric hydrometeors, and multipath effects of buildings, hills,
trees, etc.
EM wave propagation can be described by two complementary models. The physicist attempts a
theoretical model based on universal laws, which extends the ﬁeld of application more widely than
currently known. The engineer prefers an empirical model based on measurements that can be used
immediately. This section presents complementary standpoints by discussing theoretical factors affecting
wave propagation and the semiempirical rules allowing handy engineering calculations. First, we
consider wave propagation in idealistic simple media, with no obstacles. We later consider the more
realistic case of wave propagation around the Earth, as inﬂuenced by its curvature and by atmospheric
conditions.
Propagation in Simple Media
The conventional propagation models, on which the basic calculation of radio links is based, result directly
from Maxwell’s equations:
H · D ¼ rv
ð16:1Þ
H · B ¼ 0
ð16:2Þ
H · E ¼  qB
qt
ð16:3Þ
H · H ¼ J þ qD
qt
ð16:4Þ
In these equations, E is electric ﬁeld strength in volts per meter, H is magnetic ﬁeld strength in amperes per
meter, D is electric ﬂux density in coulombs per square meter, B is magnetic ﬂux density in webers per
square meter, J is conduction current density in amperes per square meter, and rv is electric charge density
in coulombs per cubic meter. These equations go hand in hand with the constitutive equations for the
medium:
D ¼ EE

B ¼ mH
ð16:6Þ
J ¼ sE
ð16:7Þ
where E ¼ EoEr, m ¼ mom r, and s are the permittivity, the permeability, and the conductivity of the medium,
respectively.
Consider the general case of a lossy medium which is charge-free (rv ¼ 0). Assuming time-harmonic ﬁelds
and suppressing the time factor e jot, Equation (16.1) to Equation (16.7) can be manipulated to yield
Helmholtz’s wave equations:

Without loss of generality, if we assume that wave propagates in the z-direction and the wave is polarized in

Equation (16.14) and Equation (16.15) show that as the EM wave travels in the medium, its amplitude is
attenuated according to eaz, as illustrated in Figure 16.1. The distance d through which the wave amplitude is
reduced by a factor of e1 (about 37%) is called the skin depth or penetration depth of the medium, i.e.:

It should be noted from Equation (16.14) and Equation (16.15) that E and H are everywhere perpendicular
to each other and also to the direction of wave propagation. Thus, the wave described by Equation (16.14) and
Equation (16.15) is said to be plane-polarized, implying that the electric ﬁeld is always parallel to the same
plane (the xz-plane in this case) and is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Also, as mentioned
earlier, the wave decays as it travels in the z-direction because of loss. This loss is expressed in the complex

propagation in other types of media. A medium is said to be a good conductor if the loss tangent is large
(s >> oE) or a lossless or good dielectric if the loss tangent is very small (s << oE). Thus, the characteristics
of wave propagation through other types of media can be obtained as special cases of wave propagation in a
lossy medium as follows:
1. Good conductors: s >> oE, E ¼ Eo, m ¼ momr
2. Good dielectric: s << oE, E ¼ EoEr, m ¼ momr
3. Free space: s ¼ 0, E ¼ Eo, m ¼ mo

where Eo ¼ 8.854 · 1012 F/m is the free-space permittivity, and mo ¼ 4p · 107 H/m is the free-space
permeability.
The conditions for each medium type are merely substituted in Equation (16.10) to Equation (16.21) to
obtain the wave properties for that medium. The formulas for calculating attenuation constant, phase
constant, and intrinsic impedance for different media are summarized in Table 16.1.
The classical model of a wave propagation presented in this subsection helps us understand some basic
concepts of EM wave propagation and the various parameters that play a part in determining the motion of a
wave from the transmitter to the receiver. We now apply the ideas to the particular case of wave propagation in
the atmosphere.
Propagation in the Atmosphere
Wave propagation hardly occurs under the idealized conditions assumed in the previous subsection. For
most communication links, the analysis must be modiﬁed to account for the presence of the Earth, the
ionosphere, and atmospheric precipitates such as fog, raindrops, snow, and hail. This will be done in this
subsection.
The major regions of the Earth’s atmosphere that are of importance in radio wave propagation are the
troposphere and the ionosphere. At radar frequencies (approximately 100 MHz to 300 GHz), the
troposphere is by far the most important. It is the lower atmosphere consisting of a nonionized region
extending from the Earth’s surface up to about 15 km. The ionosphere is the Earth’s upper atmosphere in the
altitude region from 50 km to one Earth radius (6370 km). Sufﬁcient ionization exists in this region to
inﬂuence wave propagation.
Wave propagation over the surface of the Earth may assume one of the following three principal modes:
1. Surface wave propagation along the surface of the Earth
2. Space wave propagation through the lower atmosphere
3. Sky wave propagation by reﬂection from the upper atmosphere
These modes are portrayed in Figure 16.2. The sky wave is directed toward the ionosphere, which bends the
propagation path back toward the Earth under certain conditions in a limited frequency range (0 to 50 MHz
approximately). The surface wave is directed along the surface over which the wave is propagated.
The space wave consists of the direct wave and the reﬂected wave. The direct wave travels from the

space wave obeys the optical laws in that direct and reﬂected wave components contribute to the total wave.
Although the sky and surface waves are important in many applications, we will only consider space waves
in this section.
Figure 16.3 depicts the electromagnetic energy transmission between two antennas in space. As the wave
radiates from the transmitting antenna and propagates in space, its power density decreases, as expressed
ideally in Equation (16.19). Assuming that the antennas are in free space, the power received by the receiving
antenna is given by the Friis transmission equation (Liu and Fang, 1988):

where the subscripts t and r, respectively, refer to transmitting and receiving antennas. In Equation
(16.23), P is the power in watts, G is the antenna gain (dimensionless), r is the distance between the
antennas in meters, and l is the wavelength in meters. The Friis equation relates the power received by
one antenna to the power transmitted by the other provided that the two antennas are separated by
r . 2d2/l, where d is the largest dimension of either antenna. Thus, the Friis equation applies only when
the two antennas are in the far-ﬁeld of each other. In case the propagation path is not in free space,

a correction factor F is included to account for the effect of the medium. This factor, known as the
propagation factor, is simply the ratio of the electric ﬁeld intensity Em in the medium to the electric
ﬁeld intensity Eo in free space, i.e.:
F ¼ Em

For practical reasons, Equation (16.23) and Equation (16.25) are commonly expressed in logarithmic

Pr ¼ Pt þ Gr þ Gt  Lo  Lm
ð16:26Þ
where P is power in decibels referred to 1 W (or simply dBW), G is gain in decibels, Lo is free-space loss in

while the loss due to the medium is given by

Our major concern in the rest of the section is to determine Lo and Lm for two important cases of space
propagation that differ considerably from the free-space conditions.
Effect of the Earth
The phenomenon of multipath propagation causes signiﬁcant departures from free-space conditions. The
term multipath denotes the possibility of EM wave propagation along various paths from the transmitter
to the receiver. In multipath propagation of an EM wave over the Earth’s surface, two such paths exist:
a direct path and a path via reﬂection and diffractions from the interface between the atmosphere and
the Earth. A simpliﬁed geometry of the multipath situation is shown in Figure 16.4. The reﬂected and
diffracted component is commonly separated into two parts, one specular (or coherent) and the other
diffuse (or incoherent), that can be separately analyzed. The specular component is well deﬁned in terms
of its amplitude, phase, and incident direction. Its main characteristic is its conformance to Snell’s law
for reﬂection, which requires that the angles of incidence and reﬂection be equal and coplanar. It is a
plane wave and, as such, is uniquely speciﬁed by its direction. The diffuse component, however, arises
out of the random nature of the scattering surface and, as such, is nondeterministic. It is not a plane
wave and does not obey Snell’s law for reﬂection. It does not come from a given direction but from a
continuum.
The loss factor F that accounts for the departures from free-space conditions is given by

where G is the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient, rs is the roughness coefﬁcient, D is the divergence factor, S(y) is
the shadowing function, and D is the phase angle corresponding to the path difference. We now account for
each of these terms.
The Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient G accounts for the electrical properties of the Earth’s surface. Because the
Earth is a lossy medium, the value of the reﬂection coefﬁcient depends on the complex relative permittivity Ec
of the surface, the grazing angle C and the wave polarization. It is given by

To account for the spreading (or divergence) of the reﬂected rays because of the Earth’s curvature, we
introduce the divergence factor D. The curvature has a tendency to spread out the reﬂected energy more than a
corresponding ﬂat surface. The divergence factor is deﬁned as the ratio of the reﬂected ﬁeld from curved
surface to the reﬂected ﬁeld from ﬂat surface (Kerr, 1951). Using the geometry of Figure 16.5, D is given by

The roughness coefﬁcient rs takes care of the fact that the Earth’s surface is not sufﬁciently smooth to produce
specular (mirrorlike) reﬂection except at a very low grazing angle. The Earth’s surface has a height distribution
that is random in nature. The randomness arises out of the hills, structures, vegetation, and ocean waves. It is
found that the distribution of the heights of the Earth’s surface is usually the Gaussian or normal distribution
of probability theory. If sh is the standard deviation of the normal distribution of heights, we deﬁne the
roughness parameters
g ¼ sh sin C

ð16:44Þ
If g , 1/8, specular reﬂection is dominant; if g . 1/8, diffuse scattering results. This criterion, known as
Rayleigh criterion, should only be used as a guideline since the dividing line between a specular and diffuse
reﬂection or between a smooth and a rough surface is not well deﬁned (Beckman and Spizzichino, 1963). The
roughness is taken into account by the roughness coefﬁcient (0 , rs , 1), which is the ratio of the ﬁeld
strength after reﬂection with roughness taken into account to that which would be received if the surface
were smooth. The roughness coefﬁcient is given by
rs ¼ exp 2ð2pgÞ2

The shadowing function S(y) is important at a low grazing angle. It considers the effect of geometric
shadowing—the fact that the incident wave cannot illuminate parts of the Earth’s surface shadowed by higher
parts. In a geometric approach, where diffraction and multiple scattering effects are neglected, the reﬂecting
surface will consist of well-deﬁned zones of illumination and shadow. As there will be no ﬁeld on a shadowed
portion of the surface, the analysis should include only the illuminated portions of the surface. The
phenomenon of shadowing a stationary surface was ﬁrst investigated by Beckman in 1965 and subsequently
reﬁned by Smith (1967) and others. A pictorial representation of rough surfaces illuminated at angle of

Wave Propagation

Effect of Atmospheric Hydrometeors
The effect of atmospheric hydrometeors on satellite–Earth propagation is of major concern at microwave
frequencies. The problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by atmospheric hydrometeors has attracted
much interest since the late 1940s. The main hydrometeors that exist for long duration and have the greatest
interaction with microwaves are rain and snow. At frequencies above 10 GHz, rain has been recognized as the
most fundamental obstacle on the Earth–space path. Rain has been known to cause attenuation, phase
difference, and depolarization of radio waves. For analog signals, the effect of rain is more signiﬁcant above
10 GHz, while for digital signals, rain effects can be signiﬁcant down to 3 GHz. Attenuation of microwaves
because of precipitation becomes severe owing to increased scattering and beam energy absorption by
raindrops, thus impairing terrestrial as well as Earth–satellite communication links. Cross-polarization
distortion due to rain has also engaged the attention of researchers. This is of particular interest when
frequency reuse employing signals with orthogonal polarizations is used for doubling the capacity of a
communication system. A thorough review of the interaction of microwaves with hydrometeors has been
given by Oguchi (1983).
The loss due to a rain-ﬁlled medium is given by
Lm ¼ gðRÞ ‘eðRÞ p ðRÞ
ð16:53Þ
where g is attenuation per unit length at rain rate R, ‘ is the equivalent path length at rain rate R, and p(R) is
the probability in percentage of rainfall rate R.
Attenuation is a function of the cumulative rain-rate distribution, drop-size distribution, refractive index of
water, temperature, and other variables. A rigorous calculation of g(R) incorporating raindrop-size
distribution, velocity of raindrops, and refractive index of water can be found in Sadiku (1992). For practical
engineering purposes, what is needed is a simple formula relating attenuation to rain parameters. Such is
found in the aRb empirical relationship, which has been used to calculate rain attenuation directly (Collin,
1985), i.e.:
gðRÞ ¼ aRb dB=km
ð16:54Þ
where R is the rain rate and a and b are constants. At 0–C, the values of a and b are related to frequency f in
gigahertz as follows:
a ¼ Ga f Ea
ð16:55Þ
where Ga ¼ 6.39 · 105, Ea ¼ 2.03, for f , 2.9 GHz; Ga ¼ 4.21 · 105, Ea ¼ 2.42, for 2.9 GHz # f # 54 GHz;
Ga ¼ 4.09 · 102, Ea ¼ 0.699, for 54 GHz # f , 100 GHz; Ga ¼ 3.38, Ea ¼ 0.151, for 180 GHz , f; and
b ¼ Gb f Eb
ð16:56Þ
where Gb ¼ 0.851, Eb ¼ 0.158, for f , 8.5 GHz; Gb ¼ 1.41, Eb ¼ 0.0779, for 8.5 GHz # f , 25 GHz; Gb ¼
2.63, Eb ¼ 0.272, for 25 GHz # f , 164 GHz; Gb ¼ 0.616, Eb ¼ 0.0126, for 164 GHz # f.
The effective length ‘eðRÞ through the medium is needed since rain intensity is not uniform over the path.
Its actual value depends on the particular area of interest and therefore has a number of representations
(Liu and Fang, 1988). Based on data collected in western Europe and eastern North America, the effective path
length has been approximated as (Hyde, 1984):
‘eðRÞ ¼ ½0:00741R0:766 þ ð0:232  0:00018RÞ sin y	1
ð16:57Þ
where y is the elevation angle.

ð16:58Þ
where M is the mean annual rainfall accumulation in millimeters and b is the Rice–Holmberg thunderstorm
ratio.
The effect of other hydrometeors such as water vapor, fog, hail, snow, and ice is governed by similar
fundamental principles as the effect of rain (Collin, 1985). In most cases, however, their effects are at least an
order of magnitude less than the effect of rain.
Other Effects
Besides hydrometeors, the atmosphere has the composition
given in Table 16.2. While attenuation of EM waves by
hydrometeors may result from both absorption and scatter-
ing, gases act only as absorbers. Although some of these gases
do not absorb microwaves, some possess permanent electric
and/or magnetic dipole moments and play some part in
microwave absorption. For example, nitrogen molecules do
not possess permanent electric or magnetic dipole moments
and therefore play no part in microwave absorption. Oxygen
has a small magnetic moment, which enables it to display
weak absorption lines in the centimeter and millimeter wave
regions. Water vapor is a molecular gas with a permanent
electric dipole moment. It is more responsive to excitation by
an EM ﬁeld than is oxygen.

Waveguides
Kenneth Demarest
Waveguide Modes
Any structure that guides electromagnetic waves can be considered to be a waveguide. Most often, however,
this term refers to closed metal cylinders that maintain the same cross-sectional dimensions over long
distances. Such a structure is shown in Figure 16.7, which consists of a metal cylinder that is ﬁlled with a
dielectric. When they are ﬁlled with low-loss dielectrics (such as air), waveguides typically exhibit lower losses
than transmission lines, which make them useful for transporting RF energy over relatively long distances.
They are most often used for frequencies ranging from 1 to 150 GHz.
Every type of waveguide has an inﬁnite number of distinct electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations that can
exist inside it. Each of these conﬁgurations is called a mode. The characteristics of these modes depend upon
the cross-sectional dimensions of the conducting cylinder, the type dielectric material inside the waveguide,
and the frequency of operation. Waveguide modes are typically classed according to the nature of the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld components that are directed parallel to the waveguide axis Ez Hz. These components are
called the longitudinal components of the ﬁelds. Several types of modes are possible in waveguides.
TE modes:
Transverse-electric modes, sometimes called H modes. These modes have Ez ¼ 0 at all points
within the waveguide, which means that the electric ﬁeld vector is always perpendicular
(i.e., transverse) to the waveguide axis. These modes are always possible in waveguides with
uniform dielectrics.

TM modes:
Transverse-magnetic modes, sometimes called E modes. These modes have Hz ¼ 0 at all
points within the waveguide, which means that the magnetic ﬁeld vector is perpendicular to
the waveguide axis. Like TE modes, they are always possible in waveguides with uniform
dielectrics.
EH modes:
These are hybrid modes in which neither Ez nor Hz are zero, but the characteristics of the
transverse ﬁelds are controlled more by Ez than Hz. These modes are often possible in
waveguides with inhomogeneous dielectrics.
HE modes:
These are hybrid modes, in which neither Ez nor Hz are zero, but the characteristics of the
transverse ﬁelds are controlled more by Hz than Ez. Like EH modes, these modes are often
possible in waveguides with inhomogeneous dielectrics.
TEM modes:
Transverse-electromagnetic modes, often called transmission line modes. These modes can
exist only when a second conductor exists within the waveguide, such as a center conductor
on a coaxial cable. Since these modes cannot exist in single, closed conductor structures,
they are not waveguide modes.
Waveguide modes are most easily determined by ﬁrst computing the longitudinal ﬁeld components, Ez and
Hz, that can be supported by a waveguide. From these, the ﬁelds transverse (i.e., perpendicular) to the
waveguide axis can easily be found simply by taking spatial derivatives of the longitudinal ﬁelds (Collin, 1992).
When the waveguide properties are constant along the z-axis, Ez and Hz vary in the longitudinal direction
as Ez, Hz / exp(ot  gz), where o ¼ 2pf is the radian frequency of operation and g is a complex number of
the form:
g ¼ a þ jb
ð16:59Þ
The parameters g, a, and b are called the propagation, attenuation, and phase constants, respectively, and
j ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
. When there are no metal or dielectric losses, g is always either purely real or imaginary. When g is
real, Ez and Hz have constant phase and decay exponentially with increasing z. When g is imaginary, Ez and
Hz vary in phase with increasing z but do not decay in amplitude. When this latter condition occurs, the ﬁelds
are said to be propagating.
When the dielectric is uniform (i.e., homogeneous), Ez and Hz satisfy the scalar wave equation at all points
within the waveguide (Demarest, 1998):
H2
t Ez þ h2Ez ¼ 0
ð16:60Þ
and
H2

ð16:61Þ

Here, m and e are the permeability and permittivity of the dielectric media, respectively, and k ¼ o ﬃﬃﬃ

Most of the properties of the allowed modes in practical waveguides can be found by ﬁrst assuming that
the metal walls are perfectly conducting. Under this condition, Ez ¼ 0 and qHz
qp ¼ 0 at the waveguide walls,
where p is the direction perpendicular to the waveguide wall. When these conditions are imposed upon the
general solutions of Equation (16.60) and Equation (16.61), it is found that only certain values of h are
allowed. These values are called the modal eigenvalues and are determined by the cross-sectional shape of
the waveguide. Using Equation (16.62), the propagation constant g for each mode varies with frequency

The parameter fc has units Hz and is called the model cut-off frequency. According to Equation (16.63), when
f . fc, the propagation constant g is imaginary and, thus, the mode is propagating. However, when f , fc, g
is real; this means that the ﬁelds decay exponentially with increasing values of z. Modes operating below
their cut-off frequency are not able to transport energy over large distances and are called evanescent modes.
The dominant mode of a waveguide is the one with the lowest cut-off frequency. Although higher order
modes are often useful for a variety of specialized uses of waveguides, signal distortion is usually minimized
when a waveguide is operated in the frequency range where only the dominant mode exists. This range of
frequencies is called the dominant range of the waveguide.
The distance over which the ﬁelds of propagating modes repeat themselves is called the guide wavelength lg.
From Equation (16.63), it can be shown that lg always varies with frequency according to

Þ1 is the wavelength of a plane wave of the same frequency in an inﬁnite sample of the
waveguide dielectric. For f 44 fc, lg < lo. Also, lg ! 1 as f ! fc, which is one reason why it is usually
undesirable to operate a waveguide mode near modal cut-off frequencies.
Although waveguide modes are not plane waves, the ratios of the magnitudes of their transverse electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are constant throughout the cross-section of a waveguide, just as for plane waves. This ratio is
called the modal wave impedance and has the following values for TE and TM modes:
ZTE ¼ ET
HT

ð16:66Þ
and
ZTM ¼ ET

medium.
However, as f ! fc, ZTE ! 1 and ZTM ! 0, which
means that the transverse electric ﬁelds are dominant
in TE modes near cut-off and vice versa for TM
modes.

In addition to rectangular and circular waveguides, there are several other waveguide types commonly
used in microwave applications. Among these are elliptical waveguides and ridge waveguides. The modes of
elliptical waveguides can be expressed in terms of Mathieu functions (Kretzschmar, 1970) and are similar to
those of circular waveguides, but are less perturbed by minor twists and bends of the waveguide. This
property makes them attractive for coupling to antennas.
Single and double ridge waveguides are shown in Figure 16.14. The modes of these waveguides bear
similarities to those of rectangular guides, but can only be derived numerically (Montgomery, 1971).
Ridge waveguides are useful because their dominant ranges exceed those of rectangular waveguides.
However, this range increase is obtained at the expense of higher losses and lower power-handling
capabilities. The dimensions and performance parameters of standard double ridge waveguides are shown in
Table 16.6. In this table, the ‘‘D’’ in ‘‘WRD’’ stands for double ridge, and D24 means a bandwidth ratio of
1.24:1, etc.
Waveguides are also available in a number of construction types, including rigid, semirigid, and ﬂexible.
In applications where it is not necessary for the waveguide to bend, rigid construction is always the
best, since it exhibits the lowest loss. In general, the more ﬂexible the waveguide construction is, the
higher the loss.

Waveguide Losses
There are two mechanisms that cause losses in waveguides: dielectric losses and metal losses. In both cases,
these losses cause the amplitudes of the propagating modes decay as exp(az), where a is the attenuation
constant, measured in units of Nepers/m. Typically, the attenuation constant is considered as the sum of two
components, a ¼ adie 1 amet, where adie and amet are the dielectric and metal attenuation constants,
respectively.
The attenuation constant adie can be found directly from Equation (16.63) simply by generalizing the
dielectric wavenumber k to include the effect of the dielectric conductivity s. For a lossy dielectric, the
wavenumber is given by k2 ¼ o2me 1 þ s

. Thus, from Equation (16.62) and Equation (16.63), the
attenuation constant adie due to dielectric losses is given by

where ‘‘Re’’ stands for ‘‘real part of,’’ and the allowed values of h are given by Equation (16.69) for rectangular
modes and Equation (16.73) and Equation (16.75) for circular modes.
The metal loss constant amet is usually obtained by assuming that the wall conductivity is high enough to have
only a negligible effect on the transverse properties of the modal ﬁeld patterns. Using this assumption, the power
loss in the walls per unit distance along the waveguide can then be calculated to obtain amet (Marcuvitz, 1986).
Figure 16.15 shows the metal attenuation constants for several circular waveguide modes, each normalized to
the resistivity Rs of the walls, where Rs ¼

and where m and s are the permeability and conductivity of

over large distances.
Figure 16.16 shows a comparison of the losses of various waveguide and transmission line types as a
function of frequency over their operating bandwidths. This ﬁgure clearly shows the superior loss
characteristics of waveguides over transmission lines.
Mode Launching
Signals can be coupled into or out of waveguides through apertures or couplers. In either case, it is important
to ensure that the desired modes are excited and that reﬂections back to the source are minimized. This is

The distance between the probe and the short circuit back wall is chosen to be approximately l/4, which allows
the TE10 mode launched in this direction to reﬂect from the short circuit and arrive in phase with the mode
launched toward the right.
Launching structures can also be devised to launch higher-order modes. Mode launchers that couple
the transmission line mode on a coaxial cable to the TM11 and TM21 waveguide mode are shown in Figure 16.18.

Nicholas J. Kolias and Richard C. Compton
Antennas have been widely used in communication systems since the early 1900s. Over this span of time
scientists and engineers have developed a vast number of different antennas. The radiative properties of each of
these antennas are described by an antenna pattern. This is a plot as a function of direction of the power Pr
per unit solid angle O radiated by the antenna. The antenna pattern, also called the radiation pattern, is
usually plotted in spherical coordinates y and j. Often two orthogonal cross-sections are plotted: one where
the E-ﬁeld lies in the plane of the slice (called the E-plane) and one where the H-ﬁeld lies in the plane of the
slice (called the H-plane).
Short Dipole
Antenna patterns for a short dipole are plotted in Figure 17.1. In these plots the radial distance from the origin
to the curve is proportional to the radiated power. Antenna plots are usually either on linear scales or decibel
scales (10 log power).
The antenna pattern for a short dipole may be determined by ﬁrst calculating the vector potential A
(Harrington, 1961; Lorrain and Corson, 1970; Balanis, 1982; Collin, 1985). Using Collin’s notation, the vector
potential in spherical coordinates is given by

where k0 ¼ 2p/l0, and I is the current, assumed uniform, in the short dipole of length dl (dl ,, l0). Here, the

determined using

Directivity
The directivity D(y,j) and gain G(y,j) of an antenna are deﬁned as
Dðy; jÞ ¼ radiated power per solid angle
total radiated power=4p
¼ DPrðy; jÞ=DO
Pr=4p

ð17:6Þ
For many antennas Z<1 and so the words gain and directivity can be used interchangeably. For the short
dipole:
Dðy; jÞ ¼ 3
2 sin2 y
ð17:7Þ
The maximum directivity of the short dipole is 3/2. This single number is often abbreviated as the antenna
directivity. By comparison, for an imaginary isotropic antenna which radiates equally in all directions,
D(y, c) ¼ 1. The product of the maximum directivity with the total radiated power is called the effective
isotropic radiated power (EIRP). It is the total radiated power that would be required for an isotropic radiator
to produce the same signal as the original antenna in the direction of maximum directivity.
Magnetic Dipole
A small loop of current produces a magnetic dipole. The far ﬁelds for the magnetic dipole are dual to those of
the electric dipole. They have the same angular dependence as the ﬁelds of the electric dipole, but the
polarization orientations of E and H are interchanged:
H ¼ Mk2

E ¼ MZ0k2

where M ¼ p r2
0 I for a loop with radius r0 and uniform current I.
Input Impedance
At a given frequency the impedance at the feedpoint of an antenna can be represented as Za ¼ Ra þ jXa. The
real part of Za (known as the input resistance) corresponds to radiated ﬁelds plus losses, while the imaginary
part (known as the input reactance) arises from stored evanescent ﬁelds. The radiation resistance is obtained
from Ra ¼ 2Pr/jIj2 where Pr is the total radiated power and I is the input current at the antenna terminals. For
electrically small electric and magnetic dipoles with uniform currents:

The reactive component of Za can be determined from Xa ¼ 4o(WmWe)/jIj2 where Wm is the average
magnetic energy and We is the average electric energy stored in the near-zone evanescent ﬁelds. The reﬂection
coefﬁcient, G, of the antenna is just
G ¼ Za  Z0
Za þ Z0
ð17:10Þ
where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the system used to measure the reﬂection coefﬁcient.
Arbitrary Wire Antennas
An arbitrary wire antenna can be considered as a sum of small current dipole elements. The vector potential
for each of these elements can be determined in the same way as for the short dipole. The total vector potential
is then the sum over all these inﬁnitesimal contributions and the resulting E in the far ﬁeld can be found to be

where the integral is over the contour C of the wire, a is a unit vector tangential to the wire, and r0 is the radial
vector to the inﬁnitesimal current element.
Resonant Half-Wavelength Antenna
The resonant half-wavelength antenna (commonly called the half-wave dipole) is used widely in antenna
systems. Factors contributing to its popularity are its well-understood radiation pattern, its simple con-
struction, its high efﬁciency, and its capability for easy impedance matching.
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds for the half-wave dipole can be calculated by substituting its current
distribution, I ¼ I0 cos(k0z), into Equation (17.11) to obtain

The total radiated power, Pr, can be determined from the electric and magnetic ﬁelds by integrating the
expression 1/2 (Re{E · H* : ar} over a surface of radius r. Carrying out this integration yields Pr¼36.565 jI0j2.
The radiation resistance of the half-wave dipole can then be determined from
Ra ¼ 2Pr
jI0j2 < 73 O
ð17:13Þ
This radiation resistance is considerably higher than the radiation resistance of a short dipole. For example, if
we have a dipole of length 0.01l, its radiation resistance will be approximately 0.08 O (from Equation (17.9)).
17-4
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

This resistance is probably comparable to the ohmic resistance of the dipole, thereby resulting in a low
efﬁciency. The half-wave dipole, having a much higher radiation resistance, will have much higher efﬁciency.
The higher resistance of the half-wave dipole also makes impedance matching easier.
End Loading
At many frequencies of interest, for example, the broadcast band, a half-
wavelength becomes unreasonably long. Figure 17.2 shows a way of increasing
the effective length of the dipole without making it longer. Here, additional
wires have been added to the ends of the dipoles. These wires increase the end
capacitance of the dipole, thereby increasing the effective electrical length.
Monopole Antennas
A monopole antenna consists of half of a dipole placed above and perpendicular
to a conducting ground plane. A monopole of length L behaves like a dipole of
length 2L except that the radiation only takes place above the conducting plane,
resulting in double the directivity and half the radiation resistance. The quarter-
wave monopole (L ¼ l/4) thus approximates the half-wave dipole and is often
used for mobile antennas, where the conducting plane might be the body of an
automobile or the case of a handset.
Arrays of Wire Antennas
Often it is advantageous to have several antennas operating together in an array. Arrays of antennas can be
made to produce highly directional radiation patterns. Also, small antennas can be used in an array to obtain
the level of performance of a large antenna at a fraction of the area. Arrays of dipoles are often used as base
station antennas for mobile communication systems.
The radiation pattern of an array depends on the number and type of antennas used, the spacing in the
array, and the relative phase and magnitude of the excitation currents. The ability to control the phase of the
exciting currents in each element of the array allows one to electronically scan the main radiated beam. An
array that varies the phases of the exciting currents to scan the radiation pattern through space is called an
electronically scanned phased array. Phased arrays are used extensively in radar applications.
Analysis of General Arrays
To obtain analytical expressions for the radiation ﬁelds due to an array one must ﬁrst look at the ﬁelds
produced by a single array element. For an isolated radiating element positioned as in Figure 17.3, the electric
ﬁeld at a far-ﬁeld point P is given by
Ei ¼ aiKiðy; jÞe j½k0ðRi· ipÞai	
ð17:14Þ
where Ki (y, j) is the electric ﬁeld pattern of the individual element, ai ejai is the excitation of the individual
element, Ri is the position vector from the phase reference point to the element, ip is a unit vector pointing
toward the far-ﬁeld point P, and k0 is the free space wave vector.
Now, for an array of N of these arbitrary radiating elements the total E-ﬁeld at position P is given by the
vector sum:
Etot ¼

tive electrical length of an

Antennas

This equation may be used to calculate the total ﬁeld for an array of antennas where the mutual coupling
between the array elements can be neglected. For most practical antennas, however, there is mutual coupling,
and the individual patterns will change when the element is placed in the array. Thus, Equation (17.15) should
be used with care.
Arrays of Identical Elements
If all the radiating elements of an array are identical, then Ki (y, j) will be the same for each element and
Equation (17.15) can be rewritten as
Etot ¼ Kðy; jÞ
X
N1
i¼0

where
f ðy; jÞ ¼

i¼0
aie j½k0ðRi· ipÞ  ai	
ð17:17Þ
The function f(y, j) is normally called the array factor or the array polynomial. Thus, one can ﬁnd Etot by just
multiplying the individual element’s electric ﬁeld pattern, K(y, j), by the array factor, f(y, j). This process is
often referred to as pattern multiplication.
The average radiated power per unit solid angle is proportional to the square of Etot. Thus, for an array of
identical elements:

Equally Spaced Linear Arrays
An important special case occurs when the array elements are identical and are arranged on a straight line with
equal element spacing, d, as shown in Figure 17.4. If a linear phase progression, a, is assumed for the excitation

Broadside Arrays
Suppose that, in the linear array of Figure 17.4, all the excitation currents are equal in magnitude and phase
(a0 ¼ a1 ¼ . . . ¼ aN1 and a ¼ 0). The array factor, f (c), then becomes
f ðcÞ ¼ a0

ð17:21Þ
Note that f 0(c) is maximum when c ¼ 0. For our case, with a ¼ 0, we have c ¼ k0d cosy. Thus, f 0(c) will be
maximized when y ¼ p/2. This direction is perpendicular to the axis of the array (see Figure 17.4), and so the
resulting array is called a broadside array.
Phased Arrays
By adjusting the phase of the elements of the array it is possible to vary the direction of the maximum of the
array’s radiation pattern. For arrays where all the excitation currents are equal in magnitude but not

pattern maximum:

Thus, the direction of the array factor maximum is given by
y ¼ cos1

Note that if one is able to control the phase delay, a, the direction of the maximum can be scanned without
physically moving the antenna.
Planar (2D) Arrays
Suppose there are M linear arrays, all identical to the one pictured in Figure. 17.4, lying in the yz-plane with
element spacing d in both the y and the z direction. Using the origin as the phase reference point, the array
factor can be determined to be

where ay and az are the phase differences between the adjacent elements in the y and z directions, respectively.
The formula can be derived by considering the 2D array to be a 1D array of subarrays, where each subarray has
an antenna pattern given by Equation (17.19).
If all the elements of the 2D array have excitation currents equal in magnitude and phase (all the amn
are equal and az ¼ ay ¼ 0), then the array will be a broadside array and will have a normalized array factor

Yagi-Uda Arrays
The Yagi-Uda array is very popular in the HF–VHF–
UHF frequency range and is often used as a home TV
antenna. The Yagi-Uda array avoids the problem of
needing to control the feeding currents to all of the
array elements by driving only one element. The other
elements in the Yagi-Uda array are excited by near-
ﬁeld coupling from the driven element.
The basic three-element Yagi-Uda array is shown in
Figure. 17.5. The array consists of a driven antenna of
length l1, a reﬂector element of length l2, and a
director element of length l3. Typically, the director
element is shorter than the driven element by 5% or
more, while the reﬂector element is longer than

the driven element by 5% or more (Stutzman and Thiele, 1981). The radiation pattern for the array in
Figure 17.5 will have a maximum in the þz direction.
One can increase the gain of the Yagi–Uda array by adding additional director elements. Adding additional
reﬂector elements, however, has little effect because the ﬁeld behind the ﬁrst reﬂector element is small.
Yagi-Uda arrays typically have directivities between 10 and 100, depending on the number of directors
(Ramo et al., 1984). TV antennas usually have several directors.
Log-Periodic Dipole Arrays
Another variation of wire antenna arrays is the log-periodic dipole array. The log-periodic is popular in
applications that require a broadband, frequency-independent antenna. An antenna will be independent of
frequency if its dimensions, when measured in wavelengths, remain constant for all frequencies. If,
however, an antenna is designed so that its characteristic dimensions are periodic with the logarithm of the
frequency, and if the characteristic dimensions do not vary too much over a period of time, then the
antenna will be essentially frequency independent. This is the basis for the log-periodic dipole array, shown
in Figure 17.6.
In Figure 17.6, the ratio of successive element positions equals the ratio of successive dipole lengths. This
ratio is often called the scaling factor of the log-periodic array and is denoted by
t ¼ Znþ1
Zn
¼ Lnþ1
Ln
ð17:24Þ
Also note that there is a mechanical phase reversal between successive elements in the array caused by the
crossing over of the interconnecting feed lines. This phase reversal is necessary to obtain the proper phasing
between adjacent array elements.
To get an idea of the operating range of the log-periodic antenna, note that for a given frequency within the
operating range of the antenna, there will be one dipole in the array that is half-wave resonant or is nearly so.
This half-wave resonant dipole and its immediate neighbors represent the active region of the log-periodic
array. As the operating frequency changes, the active region shifts to a different part of the log-periodic. Hence,
the frequency range for the log-periodic array is roughly given by the frequencies at which the longest and
shortest dipoles in the array are half-wave resonant (wavelengths such that 2LN , l , 2L1) (Stutzman and
Thiele, 1981).

Aperture
J. Patrick Fitch
The main purpose of an antenna is to control a wavefront at the boundary between two media: a source (or
receiver) and the medium of propagation. The source can be a ﬁber, cable, waveguide, or other transmission
line. The medium of propagation may be air, vacuum, water, concrete, metal, or tissue, depending on the
application. Antenna aperture design is used in acoustic, optic, and electromagnetic systems for imaging,
communications, radar, and spectroscopy applications.
There are many classes of antennas: wire, horn, slot, notch, reﬂector, lens, and array to name a few (see
Figure 17.7). Within each class is a variety of subclasses. For instance, the horn antenna can be pyramidal or
conical. The horn can also have ﬂaring in only one direction (sectoral horn), asymmetric components, shaped

edges, or a compound design of sectoral and pyramidal combined. For all antennas, the relevant design and
analysis will depend on antenna aperture size and shape, the center wavelength, l, and the distance from the
aperture to a point of interest (the range, R). This section covers discrete oscillators, arrays of oscillators,
synthetic apertures, geometric design, Fourier analysis, and parameters of some typical antennas. The
emphasis is on microwave-type designs.
The Oscillator or Discrete Radiator
The basic building block for antenna analysis is a linear conductor. Movement of electrons (current) in the
conductor induces an electromagnetic ﬁeld. When the electron motion is oscillatory—e.g., a dipole with
periodic electron motion—the induced electric ﬁeld, E, is proportional to cos(ot – kx þ f), where o is
radian frequency of oscillation, t is time, k is wave number, x is distance from the oscillator, and f is the phase
associated with this oscillator (relative to the time and spatial coordinate origins). When the analysis is
restricted to a ﬁxed position x, the electric ﬁeld can be expressed as
EðtÞ ¼ Acosðot þ fÞ
ð17:25Þ
where the phase term f now includes the kx term, and all of the constants of proportionality are included in
the amplitude A. Basically, the assumption is that oscillating currents produce oscillating ﬁelds. The
description of a receiving antenna is analogous: an oscillating ﬁeld induces a periodic current in the conductor.
The ﬁeld from a pair of oscillators separated in phase by d radians is
EdðtÞ ¼ A1cos ðot þ fÞ þ A2cos ðot þ f þ dÞ
ð17:26Þ
Using phasor notation, ~Ed, the cosines are converted to complex exponentials and the radial frequency term,
ot, is suppressed:
~EdðtÞ ¼ A1eif þ A2eiðfþdÞ
ð17:27Þ
The amplitude of the sinusoidal modulation Ed(t) can be calculated as j ~Edj. The intensity is
I ¼ j ~Edj2 ¼ jA1j2 þ jA2j2 þ 2A1A2cosðdÞ
ð17:28Þ
When the oscillators are of the same amplitude, A ¼ A1 ¼ A2, then:

For an incoming plane wave which is tilted at an angle y from the normal, the relative phase difference
between two oscillators is kd sin y, where d is the distance between oscillators and k is the wavenumber 2p/l
(see Figure 17.8). For three evenly spaced oscillators, the phase difference between the end oscillators is
2kd sin y. In general, the end-to-end phase difference for n evenly spaced oscillators is (n – 1)kd sin y. This
formulation is identical to the phase representation in Equation (17.30) with d ¼ kd sin y. Therefore, the
intensity as a function of incidence angle y for an evenly spaced array of n elements is

where L ¼ nd corresponds to the physical dimension (length) of the aperture of oscillators. The zeros of this
function occur at kL siny ¼ 2mp, for any nonzero integer m. Equivalently, the zeros occur when siny ¼ ml/L.
When the element spacing d is less than a wavelength, the number of zeros for 0 , y , p2 is given by the
largest integer M such that M < L/l. Therefore, the ratio of wavelength to largest dimension, l/L, determines
both the location (in y space) and the number of zeros in the intensity pattern when d < l. The number of
oscillators controls the amplitude of the side lobes.
For n ¼ 1, the intensity is constant—i.e., independent of angle. For l . L, both the numerator and
denominator of Equation (17.32) have no zeros and as the length of an array shortens (relative to a
wavelength), the intensity pattern converges to a constant (n ¼ 1 case). As shown in Figure 17.9, a separation
of l/4 has an intensity rolloff less than 1 dB over p/2 radians (a l/2 separation rolls off 3 dB). This implies that
placing antenna elements closer than l/4 does not signiﬁcantly change the intensity pattern. Many microwave
antennas exploit this and use a mesh or parallel wire (for polarization sensitivity) design rather than covering

length difference between elements is d sin y, which corresponds to a phase difference of kd sin y, where k is the wave

the analysis has not accounted for phase variations from position errors in the element placement where the
required accuracy is typically better than l/10.
For L44l, siny < y, which implies that the ﬁrst zero is at y ¼ l/L. The location of the ﬁrst zero is known
as the Rayleigh resolution criteria. That is, two plane waves separated by at least l/L radians can be
discriminated. For imaging applications, this corresponds roughly to the smallest detectable feature size. As
shown in Figure 17.10, the ﬁrst zero occurs at approximately l/L ¼ 0.25 radians (the Rayleigh resolution).
Note that there is no side lobe suppression until d < l, when the location of the zeros becomes ﬁxed. Having
more than eight array elements (separation of less than a quarter wavelength) only moderately reduces the
height of the maximum side lobe.

Synthetic Apertures
In applications such as air- and space-based radar, size and weight constraints prohibit the use of very large
antennas. For instance, if the L-band (23.5-cm wavelength) radar imaging system on the Seasat satellite
(800-km altitude, launched in 1978) had a minimum resolution speciﬁcation of 23.5 m, then, using the
Rayleigh resolution criteria, the aperture would need to be 8 km long. In order to attain the desired resolution,
an aperture is ‘‘synthesized’’ from data collected with a physically small (10 m) antenna traversing an 8-km
ﬂight path. Basically, by using a stable oscillator on the spacecraft, both amplitude and phase are recorded,
which allows postprocessing algorithms to combine the individual echoes in a manner analogous to an
antenna array. From an antenna perspective, an individual scattering element produces a different round trip
propagation path based on the position of the physical antenna—a synthetic antenna array. Using the
geometry described in Figure 17.11, the phase is

It is convenient to assume a straight-line ﬂight path along the x-axis, a planar earth (x, y plane), and a constant
velocity, v, with range and cross-range components vr(x) and vc(x), respectively. In many radar applications
the broad side distance to the center of the footprint, R, is much larger than the size of the footprint. This
allows the distance R(x) to be expanded about R resulting in

The ﬁrst term in Equation (17.34) is a constant phase offset corresponding to the center of beam range bin and
can be ignored from a resolution viewpoint. The second term, 2vr/l, is the Doppler frequency shift due to the
relative (radial) velocity between the antenna and scattering element. The third term represents a quadratic
correction of the linear ﬂight path to approximate the constant range sphere from a scattering element. It is
worth noting that synthetic aperture systems do not require the assumptions used here, but accurate position
and motion compensation is required.
For an antenna with cross range dimension D and a scattering element at range R, the largest synthetic
aperture that can be formed is of dimension lR/D (the width of the footprint). Because this data collection
scenario is for round-trip propagation, the phase shift at each collecting location is twice the shift at the edges
of a single physical antenna. Therefore, at a range R, the synthetic aperture resolution is

The standard radar interpretation for synthetic apertures is that information coded in the Doppler
frequency shift can be decoded to produce high-resolution images. It is worth noting that the synthetic
aperture can be formed even with no motion (zero Doppler shift). For the no-motion case the antenna array
interpretation is appropriate. This approach has been used for acoustic signal processing in nondestructive
evaluation systems as well as wave migration codes for seismic signal processing. When there is motion, the
Doppler term in the expansion of the range dominates the phase shift and therefore becomes the useful metric
for predicting resolution.
Geometric Designs
The phase difference in a linear array was caused by the spatial separation and allowed the discrimination of
plane waves arriving at different angles. Desired phase patterns can be determined by using analytic geometry
to position the elements. For example, if coherent superposition across a wave front is desired, the wavefront
can be directed (reﬂected, refracted, or diffracted) to the receiver in phase. For a planar wavefront, this
corresponds to a constant path length from any point on the reference plane to the receiver. Using the
geometry in Figure 17.12, the sum of the two lengths (x, R þ h) to (x, y) and (x, y) to (0, h) must be a constant
independent of x—which is R þ 2h for this geometry. This constraint on the length is

or

This is the equation for a parabola. Losses would be minimized if the wave front were specularly reﬂected to
the transceiver. Specular reﬂection occurs when the angles between the normal vector N [or equivalently the
tangent vector T¼(x,f 0(x))] ¼ (1, x/2h) and the vectors A ¼ (0, –1) and B ¼ (–x, h – y) are equal. This is the
same as equality of the inner products of the normalized vectors, which is shown by

The constant path length and high gain make the parabolic antenna popular at many wavelengths including
microwave and visible. More than one reﬂecting surface is allowed in the design. The surfaces are typically
conical sections and may be designed to reduce a particular distortion or to provide better functionality.
Compound designs often allow the active elements to be more accessible and eliminate long transmission lines.
A two-bounce reﬂector with a parabolic primary and a hyperbolic secondary is known as a Cassegrain system.

Antennas

In all reﬂector systems it is important to account for the blockage (‘‘shadow’’ of the feed, secondary reﬂector,
and support structures) as well as the spillover (radiation propagating past the intended reﬂecting surface).
Continuous Current Distributions (Fourier Transform)
Ideally, antennas would be designed using solutions to Maxwell’s equations. Unfortunately, in most cases exact
analytic and numerical solutions to Maxwell’s equations are difﬁcult to obtain. Under certain conditions,
approximations can be introduced that allow solution to the wave equations. Approximating spherical
wavefronts as quadratics has been shown for the synthetic aperture application and is valid when the
propagation distance is greater than (pL2/4l)1/3, where L is the aperture size. In general, this is known as the
Fresnel or near-ﬁeld approximation. When the propagation distance is at least 2L2/l, the angular radiation
pattern can be approximated as independent of distance from the aperture. This pattern is known as the
normalized far-ﬁeld or Fraunhofer distribution, E(y), and is related to the normalized current distributed
across an antenna aperture, i(x), by a Fourier transform:

which is Equation (17.32) when n44L=l. As with discrete arrays, the ratio L/l is the important design
parameter: sin y ¼l/L is the ﬁrst zero (no zeros for l.L) and the number of zeros is the largest integer M
such that M < L/l.

The ﬁeld and intensity given in Equation (17.41) are normalized. In practice, the ﬁeld is proportional to the
aperture area and inversely proportional to the wavelength and propagation distance.

where J1 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, order one. This far-ﬁeld intensity is called the Airy pattern.
As with the rectangular aperture, the far-ﬁeld intensity is proportional to the square of the area and inversely
proportional to the square of the wavelength and the propagation distance. The ﬁrst zero (Rayleigh resolution
criteria) of the Airy pattern occurs for uL/l ¼ 1.22 or sin y ¼ 1.22l/L. As with linear and rectangular
apertures, the resolution scales with l/L.

Figure 17.13 shows a slice through the normalized far-ﬁeld intensity of both a rectangular aperture and a
circular aperture. The linearity of the Fourier transform allows apertures to be represented as the superposition of
subapertures. The primary reﬂector, the obscurations from the support structures, and the secondary reﬂector of
a Cassegrain-type antenna can be modeled. Numerical evaluation of the Fourier transform permits
straightforward calculation of the intensity patterns, even for nonuniform current distributions.
Antenna Parameters
Direct solutions to Maxwell’s equations or solutions dependent on approximations provide the analytic tools
for designing antennas. Ultimately, the analysis must be conﬁrmed with experiment. Increasingly sensitive
radar and other antenna applications have resulted in much more attention to edge effects (from the primary
aperture, secondary, and/or support structures). The geometric theory of diffraction as well as direct Maxwell
solvers are making important contributions.
With the diversity of possible antenna designs, a collection of design rules of thumb are useful. The
directivity and gain for a few popular antenna designs are given in Table 17.1. Directivity is the ratio of the
maximum to average radiation intensity. The gain is deﬁned as the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity

there are no losses (k ¼ 1), but is less than the directivity if there are any losses in the antenna (k , 1), that is,
G ¼ kD.
As an example, consider the parabolic reﬂector antenna where efﬁciency degradation includes:
. Ohmic losses are small (k ¼ 1)
. Aperture taper efﬁciency (k ¼ 0.975)
. Spillover (feed) efﬁciency (k ¼ 0.8)
. Phase errors in aperture ﬁeld (k ¼ 0.996 to 1)
. Antenna blockage efﬁciency (k ¼ 0.99)
. Spar blockage efﬁciency (k ¼ 0.994)
Each antenna system requires a customized analysis of the system losses in order to accurately model
performance.

The Fresnel Zone Plate Antenna
James C. Wiltse
Introduction
The Fresnel zone plate is a quasi-optical component that provides the functions of a lens (or a reﬂective
antenna when the zone plate is backed by a mirror). The zone plate has the advantages of simplicity of design
and construction, planar conﬁguration, low loss, low weight, and low cost while giving performance
comparable to a lens (sometimes better). The zone plate produces lens-like focusing and imaging of
electromagnetic waves by means of diffraction, rather than refraction. Thus, the ﬁeld is often referred to as
diffraction optics. The zone plate transforms a normally-incident plane wave into a converging wave,
concentrating the radiation ﬁeld to a small focal region. Much of the material that follows has been adapted
from the author’s articles in the list of references.
There are two categories of zone plates in practice. One has been used in optical systems for decades; this is
the conﬁguration employing focal lengths (F) much larger than the diameter (D) of the plate (the small angle
or high F-number case). The other is the case employing focal lengths that are comparable to the diameter
(F/D near unity, often in the range between 0.3 and 2.5), referred to as the large-angle or ‘‘fast’’ conﬁguration.
The latter case has seen extensive investigations at microwave and millimeter wavelengths [1–8] and a few
studies at terahertz frequencies [9] between 210 GHz and 1 THz. The phase-correcting zone plate is most
often a stepped planar lens (Figure 17.14) made from low-loss materials such as polystyrene, Teﬂon,
polyethylene, TPX, polycarbonate, foamed polystyrene, low density polytetraﬂuroethylene (PTFE), foamed
polyethylene, quartz, sapphire, ceramics, and semiconductor materials such as high resistivity silicon. These
materials range in dielectric constant from approximately 1.1 to 12. It has been shown that materials having
dielectric constants below 5 are preferable because they have lower surface and internal reﬂections [6]. There
are nonplanar zone plate versions, such as spherical or paraboloidal types, but those are relatively rare and
will not be discussed here. Figure 17.14 illustrates a stepped, quarter-wave corrected zone plate. An alternative
approach would be to use rings of different dielectric constants (including air) to produce the stepped phase
corrections [2,3].
At microwave or millimeter wavelengths the steps, which are fractions of the operating wavelength, are of
convenient dimensions for machining or molding of dielectrics. At terahertz frequencies, where wavelengths
are on the order of a millimeter or less, the steps are inconveniently small. To cope with this, very low dielectric
constant materials are recommended [9]. The other major difﬁculty in the terahertz region is keeping
losses low.

Design Considerations
The typical geometry for a zone plate antenna is shown in Figure 17.15 and Figure 17.16. From Figure 17.16,
the equation for the radii of the Fresnel zones is given by

where n is the zone number, F is the focal length, l is the free-space wavelength, and P is the number of steps
to implement the phase correction (e.g., P ¼ 2 is half-wave, P ¼ 4 is quarter-wave, P ¼ 8 is eighth-wave).
If we set rn ¼ D/2 we can ﬁnd the value of n at the outer edge of the zone plate, thus giving us the number of
zones. Equation (17.44) is said to deﬁne interferometric zone plates, which are free of spherical aberration.
Note that the radii of the zones are independent of the dielectric constant, e. Typical millimeter-wave zone
plates have an F/D near unity, as illustrated in Figure 17.16. Deﬁning y as the angle between the optical axis
and the ray from the focal point to the outer edge of the zone plate, we ﬁnd that y ranges from 11.3– for
F/D ¼ 2.5 to 45– for F/D ¼ 0.5.
For the grooved zone plate, the expression for the depth of the grooves is
d ¼ l=Pð ﬃﬃe
p  1Þ
ð17:45Þ
where the parameters are as deﬁned above. Notice that d is independent of the focal length and the diameter of
the zone plate. It is obvious that the depth of the grooves is tending toward very small physical dimensions as
frequency increases toward the terahertz region.
Feed Considerations
The typical geometry for an FZP and feed is shown in Figure 17.15 and Figure 17.16. Usually the feed device is
a horn antenna, although dipole feeds have been used. The corrugated horn gives equal beamwidths in both
principal planes, which is ideal for the circular symmetry case. If the amplitude distribution produced across
the zone plate were uniform the resulting gain is maximum, but the sidelobe level is not minimized. The
feedhorn should have a beam pattern wide enough to cover the zone plate with an amplitude taper that is
several dB down at the edge of the plate. The amplitude taper reduces sidelobes, but also decreases the gain
and broadens the beamwidth. If we assume a transmitting conﬁguration, with a feed at the focal point, there
are two factors that produce a taper across the zone plate aperture. One is the radiation pattern from the
feedhorn, and the other is that the radiation from the focus travels a greater distance (Rmax) to the edge than to
the center of the zone plate (F). The zone plate is normally in the far-ﬁeld of the feedhorn, and the path length
dependence is inverse-squared. This type of dependence [F/Rmax]2 and the calculated angles are given in
FIGURE 17.16

Table 17.2 for various values of F/D. It can be seen that this path length dependence does not have a signiﬁcant
effect on the edge illumination of the zone plate until F/D becomes very small.
In addition to this path length dependence we would like some amplitude taper due to the feedhorn
pattern. We could design a feed pattern for which the ﬁrst nulls would fall at the edge of the zone plate. This
would improve efﬁciency because all the main-beam energy from the feed pattern would be included, and
there would be low spill-over loss. If the feedhorn (with circular aperture) were uniformly illuminated, the
horn main beam would contain 83.3% of the total radiated power. Since the horn aperture undoubtedly has
some amplitude taper, it will have more energy in the horn main beam, and less in the horn pattern sidelobes.
Thus the horn beam efﬁciency may be over 90%. By contrast, for a uniformly illuminated feedhorn, only
47.6% of the total radiated horn power is included in the 3dB beamwidth. If the horn pattern illuminated the
zone plate with a 3 dB edge taper, approximately half of the radiated power would be lost, although this has
been recommended by other authors in a previous article. A preferred horn beam pattern would provide a
truncated Gaussian distribution across the zone plate aperture [10]. High-quality scalar feedhorns (corrugated
horns) often produce a pattern which is nearly Gaussian. Some recently developed multimode horns produce
Gaussian beams. While an untruncated Gaussian aperture distribution has the desirable property that its
Fourier transform is also Gaussian (far-ﬁeld pattern with no sidelobes), real antenna patterns have sidelobes
resulting from the truncation of the aperture distribution. In addition, a zone plate pattern is affected by
nonconstant phase across the aperture; nonetheless, the far-ﬁeld pattern is primarily determined by the
amplitude distribution in the aperture. Goldsmith [10] has carried out an analysis to show that the aperture
efﬁciency for a circular aperture has a maximum value of 81.5% for a Gaussian distribution with an edge taper
of 10.9 dB. Aperture efﬁciency is deﬁned as the product of spillover efﬁciency and the taper efﬁciency
(resulting from the effect of the taper compared to uniform illumination). The ﬁrst sidelobe level peak is at
approximately –24 dB below the main beam compared to the value of –17.6 dB for uniform illumination. In an
actual application, there are still the questions of how much gain is needed or how narrow the main beam
should be, and given the conditions above, the answer is determined by how large the aperture must be. The
gain is related to the efﬁciency of the zone plate conﬁguration.
Efﬁciency
The overall efﬁciency of the antenna system contains not only the aperture efﬁciency mentioned above
(relating to the feed and the aperture distribution) for the transmitting situation, but also the diffraction
efﬁciency of a zone plate lens compared to a true lens, as well as the ohmic transmission loss in the lens. The
diffraction efﬁciency is determined by comparing the maximum on-axis, or focused, intensity (due to a plane
wave illumination of the FZP) to that of an ideal lens, obviously relating to the receiving situation.
Generally, the diffraction efﬁciency of the zone plate is less than for a true lens, but the ohmic loss of the zone
plate is less and in many cases the combination of these two efﬁciency factors is better (higher) for the
zone plate [11].
The diffraction efﬁciency of the FZP compared to a lens has already been analyzed by numerous
investigators, based on simpliﬁed plane-wave analysis [1]. These results will be described ﬁrst. Other recent

analyses that give different efﬁciency values are discussed in Ref. [1], but as yet the analyses have no
experimental veriﬁcation.
From the simpliﬁed analysis, the diffraction efﬁciency is given by
sin2ðf=2Þ
ðf=2Þ2
where j is the increment of phase correction. A plot of this function is shown in Figure 17.17. For a zone plate
with half-wave phase correction (j ¼ p) the efﬁciency is only 40.5%; for a quarter-wave plate (j ¼ 90–) it is
81%, and for an eighth-wave plate (j ¼ 45–) it is 95% (0.22 dB loss). When an eighth-wave or smaller
correction was used, the FZP with its lower attenuation loss has been analyzed to be better than a standard lens
for a number of cases considered between 35 and 200 GHz [11]. In two recent papers, the authors have
reported on a planar quarter-wave zone plate utilizing four dielectrics (one of which is air), rather than a
grooved dielectric, and have measured exceptionally good efﬁciencies, as high as 56.7% aperture efﬁciency
[2,12]. This is comparable to efﬁciencies for excellent parabolic reﬂector antennas. The authors did not
measure diffraction efﬁciencies for their cases.
A new zone plate structure has recently been proposed which offers higher efﬁciency, lower phase errors, and
better phase correction [13,14]. In the usual grooved FZP, the grooves are milled out so that the bottoms of the
grooves are parallel to the back of the zone plate. However, in the so-called stepped conical zone plate (SCZP),
the bottoms of the zones are tilted so that they approximate the curve of a lens. For circular symmetry the
tilted subzones form a section of a cone. The result is that when rays are traced through the SCZP, the path
lengths show smaller errors and are better-corrected. For this conﬁguration, the simpliﬁed analysis shows an
improvement for the half-wave correction from 40.5 to 95.2%. For the quarter-wave case the efﬁciency is
improved from 81 to 99%. The tilted or tapered conical subzones also offer broader bandwidth capability.
At microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies the wavelengths of interest may range from 10 cm (3 GHz)
to 3 mm (100 GHz). Fractional values (half-wave, quarter-wave) of these dimensions can easily be
machined into dielectrics like polystyrene by conventional cutters on vertical milling machines or lathes.
However, diffraction optics or binary optics for wavelengths around 1 mm require different approaches.
Possible dielectric materials are formed by semiconductor growth techniques or laser machining. These
optical diffractive elements employ phase correction to much smaller increments than quarter-wave or eighth-
wave, and very complex analysis has been developed to explain the behavior of axially symmetric diffractive
elements.

Loss Considerations
The overall efﬁciency of the FZP also depends on the attenuation or ohmic loss of the lens. Examples of such
losses were calculated for the comparison between a true lens and a half-wave corrected FZP of 20 cm
diameter and 20 cm focal length at frequencies from 35 to 200 GHz [11]. The extra attenuation for
polystyrene material ranges from about 1/4 to 2.3 dB at these frequencies. Loss will also be reduced if the FZP
center is open (has air dielectric), which is one possible design option [1,2,12]. A low dielectric constant is
desirable to reduce lens or FZP surface and/or multiple internal reﬂection losses. An analysis carried out by
van Houten and Herben showed that these reﬂection losses are low if the dielectric constant is below about 5,
which is true for polystyrene, Teﬂon, polyethylene, polycarbonate, TPX, and quartz [6].
Far-Field Patterns
The beamwidth of an FZP is essentially the same, perhaps 1 to 3% wider, as that of a true lens, for the same
illumination conditions. The usual way to obtain the antenna far-ﬁeld or Fraunhofer pattern is to apply the
Kirchoff–Fresnel integral knowing the phase and amplitude distribution across the aperture. When the
distributions are not constant, the far-ﬁeld integral (Fourier transform) usually cannot be solved in closed
form and computer numerical solutions are required [3,7,8]. However, we can see the improvement in the far-
ﬁeld pattern resulting from reduced phase errors by using the curves given by Baggen and Herben in Ref. [8].
Figure 5 of that reference shows plots of the far-ﬁeld patterns for three types of zone plates. One is the Soret
type with alternate absorbing zones (not phase-correcting) and it has the lowest gain and the highest average
sidelobes. The phase-correcting versions have improved gain and sidelobes. For half-wave correction (P ¼ 2)
the on-axis gain is about 6 dB higher and the average sidelobes are better. Going to quarter-wave correction
(P ¼ 4) gives 2 dB more on-axis gain and greatly reduced principal sidelobes and average sidelobe level. This
illustrates the improvement due to reducing the phase error.
Multiple Frequency Bands
FZP antennas are normally designed for a particular center frequency and band of operation. The response of
the zone plate is frequency dependent, however, and it is possible to design the FZP so that it will function well
at two or three widely spaced bands [3,15]. This permits the development of high-gain, narrow beamwidth
patterns at two or more bands, or one can operate in a given band with narrow beamwidth and high gain, but
suppress other bands to reduce interference or jamming, or for signal hiding purposes. It turns out, for
example, that a quarter-wave corrected FZP designed for one frequency will normally operate as a half-wave
corrected zone plate at twice the design frequency. Although the half-wave zone plate would have a 3 dB lower
gain due to the poorer phase correction, doubling the frequency for a given aperture size would add a gain
increment of about 6 dB (for a comparable amplitude distribution), so there would be an overall gain of about
3 dB at the doubled frequency.
Ref. [15] gives the analysis and derives the conditions for such FZPs, while additional theory is given in the
earlier Refs. [3,4]. Examples include a design which behaves as a sixth-wave (P ¼ 6) plate at 30 GHz and a
half-wave plate at 90 GHz, a quarter-wave design at 30 GHz, and a half-wave plate at 60 GHz, all having high
gain. A sample response curve is included which shows relative gain as a function of frequency ratio for two
zone plates with F ¼ 50l; a quarter-period plate has 24 zones, while a half-period FZP has 12 zones.
Frequency Behavior
The response of the zone plate is frequency dependent, and the intensity at the focal point exhibits a periodic
behavior with frequency. As frequency changes, the focal point moves along the axis of the zone plate.
An increase in frequency moves the focus away from the lens, and a decrease does the reverse, with a decrease
in signal level in either direction as the focus moves along the axis from the original position, reaching half-
power levels at 1.5 or 0.5 times the design frequency. The effect may be used for ‘‘focal isolation’’ and frequency
ﬁltering.

Equation (17.44) may be rearranged to solve for F as a function of frequency:
F ¼ Pr2
n
2nl  nl
2P
where l ¼ c/f and f ¼ frequency. So:
F ¼ Pfr2
n
2nc  nc
2Pf
ð17:46Þ
When numerical examples are substituted, the ﬁrst term is larger than the second term. As frequency increases,
the ﬁrst term increases and the second (smaller) term decreases. Thus the response is not linear (but may be
nearly linear in some cases). When the frequency increases, F also increases, and when frequency decreases, F
decreases.
Summary Comments
Zone plate lens antennas offer several advantages over standard lenses and certain reﬂective antennas. Usually
zone plates give comparable performance, while offering advantages of lower weight, volume, and cost, as well
as simplicity of fabrication. Zone plate antennas have seen application in several ﬁelds, including satellite
communications, radar, radiometry, point-to-point communications and missile terminal guidance.

Wavelengths in air at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies range from 1 m at 300 MHz to 1 mm at
300 GHz and are comparable to the physical dimensions of fabricated electrical components. For this reason
circuit components commonly used at lower frequencies, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, are not
readily available above 10 GHz. The available microwave frequency lumped elements have dimensions of
around 1 mm. The relationship between the wavelength and physical dimensions enables new classes of
distributed components to be constructed that have no analogy at lower frequencies. Components are realized
by disturbing the ﬁeld structure on a transmission line, resulting in energy storage and thus reactive effects.
Electric (E) ﬁeld disturbances have a capacitive effect and the magnetic (H) ﬁeld disturbances appear
inductive. Microwave components are fabricated in waveguide, coaxial lines, and strip lines. The majority of
circuits are constructed using strip lines as the cost is relatively low and they are highly reproducible due to
the photolithographic techniques used. Fabrication of waveguide components requires precision machining
but they can tolerate higher power levels and are more easily realized at millimeter-wave frequencies
(30 to 300 GHz) than either coaxial or microstrip components.
Characterization of Passive Elements
Passive microwave elements are deﬁned in terms of their reﬂection and transmission properties for an incident
wave of electric ﬁeld or voltage. Scattering (S) parameters are based on traveling waves and so naturally
describe these properties. As well they are the only ones that can be measured directly at microwave
frequencies. S parameters are deﬁned in terms of root power waves which in turn are deﬁned using forward
and backward traveling voltage waves. Consider the N port network of Figure 18.1 where the nth port has a
reference transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0n and of inﬁnitesimal length. The transmission line
at the nth port serves to separate the forward and backward traveling voltage (Vþ
n and V 
n ) and current

(Iþ

For the usual case where all of the reference transmission lines have the same characteristic impedance
Z0 ¼ 1/Y0, Y ¼ Y0(1S)(1þS)1 and S ¼ (Y0þY)1(Y0Y).
The most common situation involving conversion to and from S parameters is for a two port with both
ports having a common reference characteristic impedance Z0. Table 18.1 lists the most common conversions.
S parameters require that the reference impedances be speciﬁed. If they are not it is assumed that it is 50 O.
They are commonly plotted on Smith Charts—polar plots with lines of constant resistance and reactance
(Vendelin et al., 1990).

More convenient measures of reﬂection and transmission performance are the return loss and insertion loss
as they are relative measures of power in transmitted and reﬂected signals. In decibels:
RETURN LOSS ¼ 20 log G1 (dB)
INSERTION LOSS ¼ 20 log T (dB)
The input impedance at port 1, Zin, is related to G by
Zin ¼ Z0ð1 þ G1=1  G1Þ
The reﬂection characteristics are also described by the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), a quantity that can
be measured using relatively simple equipment. The VSWR is the ratio of the maximum voltage amplitude on
the imput transmission line ðjVþ

1 jÞ to the minimum voltage amplitude ðjVþ
1 j  jV
1 jÞ. Thus:

Most passive devices, with the notable exception of ferrite devices, are reciprocal and so Spq¼Sqp. A loss-less
passive device also satisﬁes the unitary condition: SpjSpqj2 ¼ 1, which is a statement of power conservation
indicating that all power is either reﬂected or transmitted.
Most microwave circuits are designed to minimize the reﬂected energy and maximize transmission at least
over the frequency range of operation. Thus, the return loss is high and the VSWR <1 for well-designed
circuits.
A terminated transmission line such as that in Figure 18.2(b) has an input impedance:
Zin ¼ Z0
ZL þ jZ0 tanh gd
Z0 þ jZL tanh gd
Thus, a short section ðgd551Þ of a short circuited (ZL ¼ 0) transmission line looks like an inductor and a
capacitor if it is open circuited (ZL ¼ 1). When the line is a half wavelength long, an open circuit is presented
at the input to the line if the other end is short circuited.
Transmission Line Sections
The simplest microwave circuit element is a uniform section of transmission line which can be used to
introduce a time delay or a frequency-dependent phase shift. Other line segments for interconnections include
bends, corners, twists, and transitions between lines of different dimensions (see Figure 18.3). The dimensions
and shapes are designed to minimize reﬂections and so maximize return loss and minimize insertion loss.
Discontinuities
The waveguide discontinuities shown in Figure 18.4(a)-(f) illustrate most clearly the use of E and H ﬁeld
disturbances to realize capacitive and inductive components. An E-plane discontinuity (Figure 18.4(a)) can be
modeled approximately by a frequency-dependent capacitor. H-plane discontinuities (Figure 18.4(b) and (c))
resemble inductors as does the circular iris of Figure 18.4(d). The resonant waveguide iris of Figure 18.4(e)
disturbs both the E and H ﬁelds and can be modeled by a parallel LC resonant circuit near the frequency of
resonance. Posts in waveguide are used both as reactive elements (Figure 18.4(f)) and to mount active devices
(Figure 18.4(g)). The equivalent circuits of microstrip discontinuities (Figure 18.4(k)–(o)) are again modeled
by capacitive elements if the E ﬁeld is interrupted and by inductive elements if the H ﬁeld (or current) is
FIGURE 18.3

interrupted. The stub shown in Figure 18.4(j) presents a short circuit to the through transmission line when
the length of the stub is lg=4. When the stubs are electrically short ð55lg=4Þ they introduce shunt
capacitances in the through transmission line.
Impedance Transformers
Impedance transformers are used to interface two sections of line with different characteristic impedances.
The smoothest transition and the one with the broadest bandwidth is a tapered line as shown in Figure 18.3(a)
and (e). This element tends to be very long and so step terminations called quarter-wave impedance
transformers (see Figure 18.4(h) and (i)) are sometimes used although their bandwidth is relatively small
centered on the frequency at which l ¼ lg=4. Ideally, Z0;2 ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Z0;1Z0;3
p
.
Terminations
In a termination, power is absorbed by a length of lossy material at the end of a shorted piece of transmission
line (Figure 18.5 (a) and (c)). This type of termination is called a matched load as power is absorbed and
reﬂections are very small irrespective of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. This is generally
preferred as the characteristic impedance of transmission lines varies with frequency, particularly so for
waveguides. When the characteristic impedance of a line does not vary much with frequency, as is the case with
a coaxial line, a simpler smaller termination can be realized by placing a resistor to ground (Figure 18.5(b)).
Attenuators
Attenuators reduce the level of a signal traveling along a transmission line. The basic construction is to make
the line lossy but with a characteristic impedance approximating that of the connecting lines so as to reduce
FIGURE 18.4

reﬂections. The line is made lossy by introducing a resistive vane in the case of a waveguide (Figure 18.5(d)),
replacing part of the outer conductor of a coaxial line by resistive material (Figure 18.5(e)), or covering the
line by resistive material in the case of a microstrip line (Figure 18.5(f)). If the amount of lossy material
introduced into the transmission line is controlled, a variable attenuator is achieved (e.g., Figure 18.5(d)).
Microwave Resonators
In a lumped element resonant circuit, stored energy is transferred between an inductor which stores magnetic
energy and a capacitor which stores electric energy, and back again every period. Microwave resonators
function the same way, exchanging energy stored in electric and magnetic forms but with the energy stored
spatially. Resonators are described in terms of their quality factor:
Q ¼ 2pf0
maximum energy stored in the resonator at f0
power lost in the cavity


ð18:17Þ
where f0 is the resonant frequency. The Q is reduced and thus the resonator bandwidth is increased by the
power lost due to coupling to the external circuit so that the loaded Q:
QL ¼ 2pf0
maximum energy stored in the resonator at f0
power lost in the cavity and to the external circuit


¼
1
1=Q þ 1=Qext
ð18:18Þ
where Qext is called the external Q. QL accounts for the power extracted from the resonant circuit and is
typically large. For the simple response shown in Figure 18.6(a) the half power (3 dB) bandwidth is f0/QL.

Near resonance the response of a microwave resonator is very similar to the resonance response of a parallel
or series R, L, C resonant circuit (Figure 18.6(f) and (g)). These equivalent circuits can be used over a narrow
frequency range.
Several types of resonators are shown in Figure 18.6. Figure 18.6(b) is a rectangular cavity resonator coupled
to an external coaxial line by a small coupling loop. Figure 18.6(c) is a microstrip patch reﬂection resonator.
This
resonator
has

external
circuit.
The
coupling
can
be
reduced
and
photolithographically controlled by introducing a gap as shown in Figure 18.6(d) for a microstrip gap-
coupled transmission line reﬂection resonator. The Q of a resonator can be dramatically increased by using a
high dielectric constant material as shown in Figure 18.6(e) for a dielectric transmission resonator in
microstrip. One simple application of a cavity resonator is the waveguide wavemeter (Figure 18.6(h)). Here,
the resonant frequency of a rectangular cavity is varied by changing the physical dimensions of the cavity with
a null of the detector indicating that the frequency corresponds to the resonant cavity frequency.
Tuning Elements
In rectangular waveguide the basic adjustable tuning element is the sliding short shown in Figure 18.7(a). Varying
the position of the short will change resonance frequencies of cavities. It can be combined with hybrid tees to
achieve a variety of tuning functions. The post in Figure 18.4(f) can be replaced by a screw to obtain a screw tuner
which is commonly used inwaveguide ﬁlters. Sliding short circuits can be used in coaxial lines and in conjunction
with branching elements to obtain stub tuners. Coaxial slug tuners arealso used to provide adjustable matching at
the input and output of active circuits. The slug is movable and changes the characteristic impedance of the
transmission line. It is more difﬁcult to achieve variable tuning in passive microstrip circuits. One solution is to

provide a number of pads as shown in Figure 18.7(c) which, in this case, can be bonded to the stub to obtain an
adjustable stub length. Variable amounts of phase shift can be inserted by using a variable length of line called a
line stretcher, or by a line with a variable propagation constant. One type of waveguide variable phase shifter is
similar to the variable attenuator of Figure 18.5(d) with the resistive material replaced by a low-loss dielectric.
Hybrid Circuits and Directional Couplers
Hybrid circuits are multiport components which preferentially route a signal incident at one port to the other
ports. This property is called directivity. One type of hybrid is called a directional coupler, the schematic of
which is shown in Figure 18.8(a). Here the signal incident at port 1 is coupled to ports 2 and 3 while very little
is coupled to port 4. Similarly, a signal incident at port 2 is coupled to ports 1 and 4 but very little power
appears at port 3. The feature that distinguishes a directional coupler from other types of hybrids is that the
power at the output ports (here ports 2 and 3) is different. The performance of a directional coupler is
speciﬁed by three parameters:
coupling factor ¼ P1=P3
directivity ¼ P3=P4
isolation ¼ P1=P4
ð18:19Þ
Microstrip and waveguide realizations of directional couplers are shown in Figure 18.8(b) and (c) where the
microstrip coupler couples in the backward direction and the waveguide coupler couples in the forward
direction. The powers at the output ports of the hybrids shown in Figure 18.9 are equal and so the hybrids
serve to split a signal into half as well as having directional sensitivity.
Filters
Filters are combinations of microwave passive elements designed to have a speciﬁed frequency response.
Typically, a topology of a ﬁlter is chosen based on established lumped element ﬁlter design theory. Then
computer-aided design techniques are used to optimize the response of the circuit to the desired response.

Ferrite Components
Ferrite components are nonreciprocal in that the insertion loss for a wave traveling from port A to port B is
not the same as that from port B to port A.
Circulators and Isolators
The most important type of ferrite component is a circulator (Figure 18.10(a) and (b)). The essential element
of a circulator is a piece of ferrite which when magnetized becomes nonreciprocal, preferring progression of
electromagnetic ﬁelds in one circular direction. An ideal circulator has the scattering matrix:

In addition to the insertion and return losses, the performance of a circulator is described by its isolation
which is its insertion loss in the undesired direction. An isolator is just a three-port circulator with one of the
ports terminated in a matched load as shown in the microstrip realization of Figure 18.10(c). It is used in a

transmission line to pass power in one direction but not in the reverse direction. It is commonly used to
protect the output of equipment from high reﬂected signals. The heart of isolators and circulators is the
nonreciprocal element. Electronic versions have been developed for MMICs. A four-port version is called a
duplexer and is used in radar systems and to separate the received and transmitted signals in a transceiver.
YIG Tuned Resonator
A magnetized yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere, shown in Figure 18.10(d), provides coupling between two
lines over a very narrow bandwidth. The center frequency of this bandpass ﬁlter can be adjusted by varying the
magnetizing ﬁeld.
Passive Semiconductor Devices
A semiconductor diode can be modeled by a voltage-dependent resistor and capacitor in shunt. Thus an
applied dc voltage can be used to change the value of a passive circuit element. Diodes optimized to produce a
voltage variable capacitor are called varactors. In detector circuits a diode’s voltage variable resistance is used
to achieve rectiﬁcation and, through design, produce a dc voltage proportional to the power of an incident
microwave signal. A controllable variable resistance is used in a PIN diode to realize an electronic switch.

Active Microwave Devices
Robert J. Trew
Active devices that can supply gain at microwave frequencies can be fabricated from a variety of
semiconductor materials. The availability of such devices permits a wide variety of system components to be
designed and fabricated. Systems are generally constructed from components such as ﬁlters, ampliﬁers,
oscillators, mixers, phase shifters, switches, etc. Active devices are primarily required for the oscillator and
ampliﬁer components. For these functions, devices that can supply current, voltage, or power gain at the
frequency of interest are embedded in circuits that are designed to provide the device with the proper
environment to create the desired response. The operation of the component is dictated, therefore, by both the
capabilities of the active device and its embedding circuit.
It is common to fabricate microwave integrated circuits using both hybrid and monolithic techniques.
In the hybrid approach, discrete active devices are mounted in radio frequency (RF) circuits that can be
fabricated from waveguides or transmission lines fabricated using coaxial, microstrip, stripline, coplanar
waveguide, or other such media. Monolithic circuits are fabricated with both the active device and the RF
circuit fabricated in the same semiconductor chip. Interconnection lines and the embedding RF circuit are
generally fabricated using microstrip or coplanar waveguide transmission lines.
Active microwave devices can be fabricated as two-terminal devices (diodes) or three-terminal devices
(transistors). Generally, three-terminal devices are preferred for most applications since the third terminal
provides a convenient means to control the RF performance of the device. The third terminal allows for
inherent isolation between the input and output RF circuit. Ampliﬁers and oscillators can easily be designed
by providing circuits with proper stabilization or feedback characteristics. Ampliﬁers and oscillators can also
be designed using two-terminal devices (diodes), but input/output isolation is more difﬁcult to achieve since
only one RF port is available. In this case it is generally necessary to use RF isolators or circulators.
The most commonly used two-terminal active devices consist of Gunn, tunnel, and IMPATT diodes. These
devices can be designed to provide useful gain from low gigahertz frequencies to high millimeter-wave
frequencies. Three-terminal devices consist of bipolar (BJT), heterojunction bipolar (HBT), and ﬁeld-effect
transistors (MESFETs and HEMTs). These devices can also be operated from UHF to millimeter-wave
frequencies.
Semiconductor Material Properties
Active device operation is strongly dependent upon the charge transport characteristics of the semiconductor
materials from which the device is fabricated. Semiconductor materials can be grown in single crystals with
very high purity. The electrical conductivity of the crystal can be precisely controlled by introduction of
minute quantities of dopant impurities. When these impurities are electrically activated, they permit precise
values of current ﬂow through the crystals to be controlled by potentials applied to contacts, placed upon the
crystals. By clever positioning of the metal contacts, various types of semiconductor devices are fabricated. In
this section we will brieﬂy discuss the important material characteristics.
18-12
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Semiconductor material parameters of interest for device fabrication consist of those involved in charge
transport through the crystal, as well as thermal and mechanical properties of the semiconductor. The
charge transport properties describe the ease with which free charge can ﬂow through the material. For
example, the velocity–electric ﬁeld characteristics for several commonly used semiconductors are shown in
Figure 18.11. At low values of electric ﬁeld, the charge transport is ohmic and the charge velocity is directly
proportional to the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld. The proportionality constant is called the mobility and
has units of cm2/V s. Above a critical value for the electric ﬁeld, the charge velocity saturates and either
becomes constant (e.g., Si) or decreases with increasing ﬁeld (e.g., GaAs). Both of these behaviors have
implications for device fabrication, especially for devices intended for high-frequency operation. Generally, a
high velocity is desired since current is directly proportional to velocity. Also, a low value for the saturation
electric ﬁeld is desirable since this implies a high-charge mobility. High mobility implies low resistivity and,
therefore, low values for parasitic and access resistances for semiconductor devices.
The decreasing electron velocity with electric ﬁeld characteristic for compound semiconductors such as
GaAs and InP makes possible active two-terminal devices called transferred electron devices (TEDs) or Gunn
diodes. The negative slope of the velocity versus electric ﬁeld characteristic implies a decreasing current with
increasing voltage. That is, the device has a negative resistance. When a properly sized piece of these materials
is biased and placed in a resonant cavity, the device will be unstable up to very high frequencies. By proper
selection of embedding impedances oscillators or ampliﬁers can be constructed.
Other semiconductor materials parameters of interest include thermal, dielectric constant, energy bandgap,
electric breakdown characteristics, and minority carrier lifetime. The thermal conductivity of the material is
important because it describes how easily heat can be extracted from the device. The thermal conductivity has
units of W/cm K. Generally, high thermal conductivity is desirable. Compound semiconductors, such as GaAs
and InP, have relatively poor thermal conductivity compared to elemental semiconductors such as Si.
Materials such as SiC have excellent thermal conductivity and have uses in high-power electronic devices. The
dielectric constant is important since it affects the size of the semiconductor device. The larger the dielectric
constant, the smaller the device. Electric breakdown characteristics are important since breakdown limits the
magnitudes of the dc and RF voltages that can be applied to the device. This is turn limits the RF power that
can be handled by the device. The electric breakdown for the material is generally described by the critical
value of electric ﬁeld that produces avalanche ionization. Minority carrier lifetime is important for bipolar
FIGURE 18.11
Electron velocity versus electric ﬁeld for several semiconductors. This ﬁgure shows the electron velocity in
several common semiconductors as a funcation of electric ﬁeld strength. At low electric ﬁeld the electron velocity is ohmic,
as indicated by the linear characteristic. At higher electric ﬁeld strength the electron velocity saturates and becomes
nonlinear. Compound semiconductors such as GaAs and InP have highly nonlinear behavior at large electric ﬁelds.

Microwave Devices

devices, such as pn-junction diodes, rectiﬁers, and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). A low value for
minority carrier lifetime is desirable for devices such as diode temperature sensors and switches where low
reverse bias leakage current is desirable. A long minority carrier lifetime is desirable for devices such as bipolar
transistors. For materials such as Si and SiC, the minority carrier lifetime can be varied by controlled impurity
doping. A comparison of some of the important material parameters for several common semiconductors is
presented in Table 18.2.
Two-Terminal Active Microwave Devices
The IMPATT diode, transferred electron device, and tunnel diode are the most commonly used two-terminal
devices. These devices can operate from the low microwave through high millimeter-wave frequencies. They
were the ﬁrst semiconductor devices that could provide useful RF power levels at microwave and millimeter-
wave frequencies. The three devices are similar in that they are fabricated from blocks of semiconductors and
require two electrodes (anode and cathode) for supplying dc bias. The same electrodes are used for the RF
port, and since only two electrodes are available, the devices must be operated as a one-port network. This is
generally accomplished by mounting the semiconductor in a pin-type package. The package can then be
positioned in an RF circuit or resonant cavity and the top and bottom pins on the package used as the dc and
RF electrical contacts. This arrangement works quite well and packaged devices can be operated up to about
90 to 100 GHz. For higher-frequency operation, the devices are generally mounted directly into circuits using
microstrip or some other similar technology.
All three devices operate as negative immittance components. That is, their active characteristics can be
described as either a negative resistance or a negative conductance. Which description to use is determined by
the physical operating principles of the particular device.
Tunnel Diodes
Tunnel diodes (Sze, 1981) generate active characteristics by a mechanism involving the physical tunneling of
electrons between energy bands in highly doped semiconductors. For example, if a pn-junction diode is heavily
doped, the conduction and valence bands will be located in close proximity and charge carriers can tunnel
through the electrostatic barrier separating the p-type and n-type regions, rather than be thermionically emitted
over the barrier as generally occurs in this type of diode. When the diode is biased (either forward or reverse bias)
current immediately ﬂows and junction conduction is basically ohmic. In the forward bias direction, conduction
occurs until the applied bias forces the conduction and valence bands to separate. The tunnel current then
decreases and normal junction conduction occurs. In the forward bias region where the tunnel current is
decreasing with increasing bias voltage, a negative immittance characteristic is generated. The immittance is
called ‘‘N-type’’ because the I–V characteristic ‘‘looks like’’ the letter N. This type of active element is short-circuit
stable and is described by a negative conductance in shunt with a capacitance. Tunnel diodes are limited in
operation frequency by the time it takes for charge carriers to tunnel through the junction. Since this time is very
short (on the order of 10–12 sec) operation frequency can be very high, approaching 1000 GHz. Tunnel diodes
have been operated at hundreds of gigahertz, limited by practical packaging and parasitic impedance
considerations. The RF power available from a tunnel diode is limited (hundreds of milliwatts level) since the

maximum RF voltage swing that can be applied across the junction is limited by the forward turn-on
characteristics of the device (typically 0.6 to 0.9 V). Increased RF power can only be obtained by increasing device
area to increase RF current, but device area is limited by operation frequency according to an inverse scaling law.
Tunnel diodes have moderate dc-to-RF conversion efﬁciency (,10%), very low noise ﬁgures, and are useful in
low-noise systems applications, such as microwave and millimeter-wave receivers.
Transferred Electron Devices
Transferred electron devices (i.e., Gunn diodes) (Bosch and Engelmann, 1975) also have N-type active
characteristics and can be modeled as a negative conductance in parallel with a capacitance. Device operation,
however, is based upon a fundamentally different principle. The negative conductance derives from the
complex conduction band structure of certain compound semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP. In these
direct bandgap materials the central (or G) conduction band is in close energy-momentum proximity to
secondary, higher-order conduction bands (i.e., the X and L valleys). The electron effective mass is determined
by the shape of the conduction bands, and the effective mass is ‘‘light’’ in the G valley but ‘‘heavy’’ in the
higher-order X and L valleys. When the crystal is biased, current ﬂow is initially due to electrons in the light
effective mass G valley and conduction is ohmic. However, as the bias ﬁeld is increased, an increasing
proportion of the free electrons are transferred into the X and L valleys where the electrons have heavier
effective mass. The increased effective mass slows down the electrons, with a corresponding decrease in
conduction current through the crystal. The net result is that the crystal displays a region of applied bias
voltages where current decreases with increasing voltage. That is, a negative conductance is generated. The
device is unstable and, when placed in an RF circuit or resonant cavity, oscillators or ampliﬁers can be
fabricated. The device is not actually a diode since no pn or Schottky junction is used. The phenomenon is a
characteristic of the bulk material and the special structure of the conduction bands in certain compound
semiconductors. Most semiconductors do not have the conduction band structure necessary for the
transferred electron effect. The term Gunn diode is actually a misnomer since the device is not a diode. TEDs
are widely used in oscillators from the microwave through high millimeter-wave frequency bands. They have
good RF output power capability (milliwatts to watts level),
moderate efﬁciency (,20%), and excellent noise and bandwidth
capability. Octave band tunable oscillators are easily fabricated
using devices such as YIG (yttrium iron garnet) resonators or
varactors as the tuning element. Most commercially available
solid-state sources for 60- to 100-GHz operation generally use InP
TEDs.
IMPATT Diodes
Impact avalanche transit time (IMPATT) diodes (Bhartia and
Bahl, 1984) are fabricated from pn or Schottky junctions.
A typical pn junction device is shown in Figure 18.12. For
optimum RF performance the diode is separated, by use of
specially designed layers of controlled impurity doping, into
avalanche and drift regions. In operation the diode is reverse
biased into avalanche breakdown. Due to the very sensitive I–V
characteristic, it is best to bias the diode using a constant current
source in which the magnitude of the current is limited. When
the diode is placed in a microwave resonant circuit, RF voltage
ﬂuctuations in the bias circuit grow and are forced into a narrow
frequency range by the impedance characteristics of the resonant
circuit. Because of the avalanche process the RF current across
the avalanche region lags the RF voltage by 90–. This inductive
delay is not sufﬁcient, by itself, to produce active characteristics.
However, when the 90– phase shift is added to that arising from
FIGURE 18.12
Diagram showing the struc-
ture for a typical pn-junction IMPATT diode.
This particular diode is called a double-drift
device because avalanche breakdown occurs
at the pn-junction, which is located in the
middle of the device. When operated in
breakdown, electrons would travel through
the
n-type
region
towards
the
positive
terminal of the bias source and holes would
travel through the p-type region towards the
negative terminal of the source. The diode,
therefore, operates as two diodes connected in
a back-to-back conﬁguration. The frequency
capability of the device is directly propor-
tional to the width of the n and p regions.
18-15
Microwave Devices

an additional inductive delay caused by the transit time of the carriers drifting through the remainder of the
diode external to the avalanche region, a phase shift between the RF voltage and current greater than 90– is
obtained. A Fourier analysis of the resulting waveforms reveals a device impedance with a negative real part.
That is, the device is active and can be used to generate or amplify RF signals. The device impedance has an
‘‘S-type’’ active characteristic and the device equivalent circuit consists of a negative resistance in series with
an inductor. The device has signiﬁcant pn-junction capacitance that must be considered, and a complete
equivalent circuit would include the device capacitance in parallel with the series negative resistance-
inductance elements. For optimum performance the drift region is designed so that the electric ﬁeld
throughout the RF cycle is sufﬁciently high to produce velocity saturation for the charge carriers. In order to
achieve this, it is common to design complex structures consisting of alternating layers of highly doped and
lightly doped semiconductor regions. These structures are called ‘‘high-low,’’ ‘‘low-high-low,’’ or ‘‘Read’’
diodes, after the man who ﬁrst proposed their use. They can also be fabricated in a back-to-back
arrangement to form double-drift structures. These devices are particularly attractive for millimeter-wave
applications. IMPATT diodes can be fabricated from most semiconductors, but are generally fabricated from
Si or GaAs. The devices are capable of good RF output power (mW to W) and good dc-to-RF conversion
efﬁciency (,10 to 20%). They operate well into the millimeter-wave region and have been operated as high
as 340 GHz. They have moderate bandwidth capability, but have relatively poor noise performance due to
the impact ionization process.
Although the two-terminal active devices are used in many electronic systems, the one-port characteristic
can introduce signiﬁcant complexity into circuit design. Isolators and circulators are generally required, and
these components are often large and bulky. They are often fabricated from magnetic materials, which can
introduce thermal sensitivities. For these reasons three-terminal devices have replaced two-terminal devices in
many practical applications. Generally, if two-terminal and three-terminal devices with comparable capability
are available, the three-terminal device offers a more attractive design solution and will be selected. Two-
terminal devices are generally only used when a comparable three-terminal device is not available. For this
reason IMPATT and TED devices are used in millimeter-wave applications, where they retain an advantage in
providing good RF power. Tunnel diodes are not often used, except in a few special applications where their
low-noise and wide-bandwidth performance can be used to advantage.
Three-Terminal Active Microwave Devices
The high-frequency performance of three-terminal semiconductor devices has improved dramatically during
the past two decades. Twenty years ago transistors that could provide useful gain at frequencies above 10 GHz
were a laboratory curiosity. Today, such devices are readily available, and state-of-the-art transistors operate
well above 100 GHz. This dramatic improvement has been achieved by advances in semiconductor growth
technology, coupled with improved device design and fabrication techniques. Semiconductor materials
technology continues to improve and new device structures that offer improved high-frequency performance
are continually being reported.
In this section we will discuss the two most commonly employed transistors for microwave applications, the
metal-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MESFET) (Liechti, 1976) and the bipolar transistor (BJT) (Cooke,
1971). These two transistors are commonly employed in practical microwave systems as ampliﬁers, oscillators,
and gain blocks. The transistors have replaced many two-terminal devices due to their improved performance
and ease of use. Transistors are readily integrated into both hybrid and monolithic integrated circuit
environments (MICs). This, in turn, has resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced size, weight, and dc power
consumption, as well as increased reliability and mean time to failure for systems that use these components.
Transistors are easily biased and the two-port network conﬁguration leads naturally to inherent separation
between input and output networks.
Field-Effect Transistors
A cross-sectional view of a microwave MESFET is shown in Figure 18.13. The device is conceptionally very
simple. The MESFET has two ohmic contacts (the source and drain) separated by some distance, usually in
18-16
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

the range of 3 to 10 mm. A rectifying Schottky contact (the gate) is located between the two ohmic contacts.
Typically, the gate length is on the order of 0.1 to 2 mm for modern microwave devices. The width of the
device scales with frequency and typically ranges from about 1 to 10 mm for power microwave devices to
50 mm for millimeter-wave devices. All three contacts are located on the surface of a thin conducting layer
(the channel) which is located on top of a high-resistivity, nonconductive substrate to form the device. The
channel region is typically very thin (on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 mm) and is fabricated by epitaxial growth or
ion implantation. In operation, the drain contact is biased at a speciﬁed potential (positive drain potential for
an n-channel device) and the source is grounded. The ﬂow of current through the conducting channel is
controlled by negative dc and superimposed RF potentials applied to the gate, which modulate the channel
current and provide RF gain. The current ﬂow is composed of only one type of charge carrier (generally
electrons) and the device is termed unipolar. The MESFET can be fabricated from a variety of
semiconductors, but is generally fabricated from GaAs. MESFETs fabricated from Si do not work at high
frequencies as well as those fabricated from GaAs due to lower electron mobility in Si (e.g., mn ,6000 cm2/V s
for GaAs and 1450 cm2/V s for Si). The lower electron mobility in Si produces high source resistance, which
seriously degrades the high-frequency gain possible from the device.
MESFETs can be optimized for small-signal, low-noise operation or for large-signal, RF power applications.
Generally, low-noise operation requires short gate lengths, relatively narrow gate widths, and highly doped
channels. Power devices generally have longer gate lengths, much wider gate widths, and lower doped
channels. Low-noise devices can be fabricated that operate with good gain (,10 dB) and low noise ﬁgure
(,3 dB) to above 100 GHz. Power devices can provide RF power levels on the order of watts (W) up to over
20 GHz.
The current gain of the MESFET is indicated by the fT of the device, sometimes called the gain-bandwidth
product. This parameter is deﬁned as the frequency at which the short-circuited current gain is reduced to
unity and can be expressed as
f T ¼
gm
2pCgs
ð18:21Þ
where gm is the device transconductance (a measure of gain capability) and Cgs is the gate source capacitance.
High fT is desirable and this is achieved with highly doped channels and low capacitance gates. The RF power
gain is also of interest and this performance can be indicated by the unilateral power gain deﬁned as

the gate resistance. As this expression indicates, large power gain requires a high fT, and a large Rds/Rg ratio.
The highest frequency at which the device could be expected to produce power gain can be deﬁned from the
frequency, f, at which U goes to zero. This frequency is called the maximum frequency of oscillation, or fmax,
and is deﬁned as

A different form of ﬁeld-effect transistor can be fabricated by inserting a highly doped, wider-bandgap
semiconductor between the conducting channel and the gate electrode (Drummond et al., 1986). The
conducting channel is then fabricated from undoped semiconductor. The discontinuity in energy bandgaps
between the two semiconductors, if properly designed, results in free charge transfer from the highly doped,
wide-bandgap semiconductor into the undoped, lower-bandgap channel semiconductor. The charge
accumulates at the interface and creates a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The sheet charge is
essentially two-dimensional and allows current to ﬂow between the source and drain electrodes. The
amount of charge in the 2DEG can be controlled by the potential applied to the gate electrode. In this
manner the current ﬂow through the device can be modulated by the gate and gain results. Since the charge
ﬂows at the interface between the two materials, but is conﬁned in the undoped channel semiconductor, very
little impurity scattering occurs and extremely high charge carrier mobility results. The device,
therefore, has very high transconductance and is capable of very high frequency operation and very
low noise ﬁgure operation. This type of device is called a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). HEMTs
can be fabricated from material systems such as AlGaAs/GaAs or AlInAs/GaInAs/InP. The latter
material system produces devices that have fT’s above 300 GHz and have produced noise ﬁgures of
about 1 dB at 100 GHz.
Bipolar Transistors
A cross-sectional view of a bipolar transistor is shown in Figure 18.14. The bipolar transistor consists of
back-to-back pn junctions arranged in a sandwich structure. The three regions are designated the emitter,
base, and collector. This type of device differs from the ﬁeld-effect transistors in that both electrons and holes
are involved in the current transport process (thus the designation bipolar). Two structures are possible: pnp
or npn, depending upon the conductivity type common to both pn junctions. Generally, for microwave
applications the npn structure is used since device operation is controlled by electron ﬂow. In general,
electron transport is faster than that for holes, and npn transistors are capable of superior high-frequency
performance compared to comparable pnp transistors. In operation, the base-emitter pn-junction is forward
biased and the collector-base pn-junction is reverse biased. When an RF signal is applied to the base-emitter
junction the junction allows a current to be injected into the base region. The current in the base region
consists of minority charge carriers (i.e., carriers with the opposite polarity compared to the base material—
electrons for an npn transistor). These charge carriers then diffuse across the base region to the base-
collector junction, where they are swept across the junction by the large reverse bias electric ﬁeld. The reverse
bias electric ﬁeld in the base-collector region is generally made sufﬁciently large that the carriers travel at
their saturation velocity. The transit time of the charge carriers across this region is small, except for
millimeter-wave transistors where the base-collector region transit time can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the
total time required for a charge carrier to travel from the emitter through the collector. The operation of the
transistor is primarily controlled by the ability of the minority charge carriers to diffuse across the base
region. For this reason microwave transistors are designed with narrow base regions in order to minimize
the time required for the carriers to travel through this region. The base region transit time is generally the
limiting factor in determining the high-frequency capability of the transistor. The gain of the transistor is
also signiﬁcantly affected by minority carrier behavior in the base region. The density of minority carriers is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the density of majority carriers (majority carrier density is approximately equal to
18-18
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

the impurity doping density) for typical operating conditions and the probability that the minority charge
will recombine with a majority carrier is high. If recombination occurs, the minority charge cannot reach the
base-collector junction but appears as base current. This, in turn, reduces the current gain capability of
the transistor. Narrow base regions reduce the semiconductor volume where recombination can occur
and, therefore, result in increased gain. Modern microwave transistors typically have base regions on
the order of 0.1 to 0.25 mm.
The frequency response of a bipolar transistor can be determined by an analysis of the total time it takes for
a charge carrier to travel from the emitter through the collector. The total time can be expressed as
tec ¼ te þ tb þ tc þ t0
c
ð18:24Þ
where tec is the total emitter–collector transit time, te is the base-emitter junction capacitance charging time,
tb is the base region transit time, tc is the base-collector junction capacitance charging time, and t0
c is the base-
collector region transit time. The total emitter-base time is related to the gain-bandwidth capability of the
transistor according to the relation:
fT ¼
1
2ptec
ð18:25Þ
Since the bipolar transistor has three terminals, it can be operated in various conﬁgurations, depending
upon the electrode selected as the common terminal. The two most commonly employed are the common
emitter (CE) and the common base (CB) conﬁgurations, although the common collector (CC) conﬁguration
can also be used. Small-signal ampliﬁers generally use the CE conﬁguration and power ampliﬁers often use the
CB conﬁguration.
The current gain for a bipolar transistor is shown in Figure 18.15. The current gains of the transistor
operated in the CE and CB conﬁgurations are called b and a, respectively. As indicated in the ﬁgure, the CE
current gain b is much larger than the CB current gain a, which is limited to values less than unity. For
modern microwave transistors ao ,0.98 to 0.99 and bo ,50 to 60.

doping type and relative concentration level. This device has the collector electrode on the bottom of the device.

In order to maximize the high-frequency performance of a transistor, it is necessary to design the device so
that it has high current gain ( fT), low base resistance (rb), and low collector capacitance (Cc).
Bipolar transistors operating to about 20 GHz are generally fabricated from Si. These devices are easily
fabricated and low cost. They are useful in moderate gain and low to high RF power applications. The have
relatively high noise ﬁgure that varies from about 1 dB at 1 GHz to about 4 to 5 dB at 10 GHz.
An improved high-frequency bipolar transistor can be fabricated using heterostructures of compound semi-
conductors, such as AlGaAs/GaAs (Kroemer, 1982). These devices have their emitters fabricated from a wide-
bandgap semiconductor (such as AlGaAs) and the remainder of the device fabricated from the lower-bandgap
semiconductor (GaAs). The wide-bandgap emitter results in improved charge injection efﬁciency across the
base-emitter junction into the base region and much improved RF performance. While the operation of
standard Si bipolar transistors is limited to frequencies less than about 40 GHz, the heterojunction bipolar
transistors (HBTs) can operate in excess of 100 GHz. They are useful in both low-noise and high RF power
applications. The heterostructure concept has recently been applied in Si-based devices using heterostructures
using SiGe/Si compounds. These devices show consider promise for high-frequency applications and the
transistors have demonstrated RF performance comparable to that obtained from the AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs.

Comparison of Bipolar Transistor and MESFET Noise Figures
In low-noise applications, GaAs MESFETs are generally preferred to Si bipolar transistors. The MESFET
demonstrates a lower noise ﬁgure than the bipolar transistor throughout the microwave frequency range, and
the advantage increases with frequency. This advantage is demonstrated by a comparison of the expressions for
the minimum noise ﬁgure for the two devices. The bipolar transistor has a minimum noise ﬁgure that can be
expressed as

Comparing these expressions shows that the minimum noise ﬁgure increases with frequency quadratically
for bipolar transistors and linearly for MESFETs. Therefore, as operating frequency increases, the MESFET
demonstrates increasingly superior noise ﬁgure performance as compared to Si bipolar transistors.
Conclusions
Various active solid-state devices that are useful at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies have been
discussed. Both two-terminal and three-terminal devices were included. The most commonly used two-
terminal devices are tunnel diodes, transferred-electron devices, and IMPATT diodes. Three-terminal devices
consist of various forms of ﬁeld-effect transistors and bipolar transistors. Recent advances employ
heterostructures using combinations of different semiconductors to produce devices with improved RF
performance, especially for high-frequency applications. Both two-terminal and three-terminal devices can
provide useful gain at frequencies in excess of 100 GHz. Further improvements are likely as fabrication
technology continues to improve.
Deﬁning Terms
Active device:
A device that can convert energy from a dc bias source to a signal at an RF frequency. Active
devices are required in oscillators and ampliﬁers.
Charge carriers:
Units of electrical charge that when moving produce current ﬂow. In a semiconductor
two types of charge carriers exist: electrons and holes. Electrons carry unit negative charge and have an
effective mass that is determined by the shape of the conduction band in energy-momentum space. The
effective mass of an electron in a semiconductor is generally signiﬁcantly less than an electron in free
space. Holes have unit positive charge. Holes have an effective mass that is determined by the shape of
18-21
Microwave Devices

the valence band in energy-momentum space. The effective mass of a hole is generally signiﬁcantly
larger than that for an electron. For this reason electrons generally move much faster than holes when an
electric ﬁeld is applied to the semiconductor.
Gain:
A measure of the ability of a network to increase the energy level of a signal. Gain is generally
measured in decibels. For voltage or current gain: G(dB) ¼ 20 log(Sout/Sin), where S is the RF voltage or
current out of and into the network. For power gain G(dB) ¼ 10 log(Pout/Pin). If the network has net
loss, the gain will be negative.
Noise ﬁgure:
A measure of the noise added by a network to an RF signal passing through it. Noise ﬁgure
can be deﬁned in terms of signal-to-noise ratios at the input and output ports of the network. Noise
ﬁgure is generally measured in decibels and can be deﬁned as F(dB)¼10 log[(S/N)in/(S/N)out].
One-port network:
An electrical network that has only one RF port. This port must be used as both the
input and output to the network. Two-terminal devices result in one-port networks.
Three-terminal device:
An electronic device that has three contacts, such as a transistor.
Transconductance:
A measure of the gain capability of a transistor. It is deﬁned as the change in output
current as a function of a change in input voltage.
Two-port network:
An electrical network that has separate RF ports for the input and output. Three-
terminal devices can be conﬁgured into two-port networks.
Two-terminal device:
An electronic device, such as a diode, that has two contacts. The contacts are
usually termed the cathode and anode.

Grounding, Shielding, and Filtering
Leland H. Hemming and Ken Kaiser
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is deﬁned to exist when undesirable voltages or currents are present to
inﬂuence adversely the performance of an electronic circuit or system. Interference can be within the system
(intrasystem), or it can be between systems (intersystem). The system is the equipment or circuit over which
one exercises design or management control.
The cause of an EMI problem is an unplanned coupling between a source and a receptor by means of a
transmission path. Transmission paths may be conducted or radiated. Conducted interference occurs by
means of metallic paths. Radiated interference occurs by means of near- and far-ﬁeld coupling. These different
paths are illustrated in Figure 19.1.
The control of EMI is best achieved by applying good interference control principles during the design
process. These involve the selection of signal levels, impedance levels, frequencies, and circuit conﬁgurations
that minimize conducted and radiated interference. In addition, signal levels should be selected to be as low as
possible, while being consistent with the required signal-to-noise ratio. Impedance levels should be chosen to
minimize undesirable capacitive and inductive coupling.
The frequency spectral content should be designed for the speciﬁc needs of the circuit, minimizing inter-
ference by constraining signals to desired paths, eliminating undesired paths, and separating signals from
interference. Interference control is also achieved by physically separating leads carrying currents from
different sources.
For optimum control, the three major methods of EMI suppression—grounding, shielding, and ﬁltering—
should be incorporated early in the design process. The control of EMI is ﬁrst achieved by proper grounding,
then by good shielding design, and ﬁnally by ﬁltering.
19-1

Grounding is the process of electrically establishing a low impedance path between two or more points in a
system. An ideal ground plane is a zero potential, zero impedance body that can be used as reference for all
signals in the system. Associated with grounding is bonding, which is the establishment of a low impedance
path between two metal surfaces.
Shielding is the process of conﬁning radiated energy to the bounds of a speciﬁc volume or preventing
radiated energy from reaching a speciﬁc volume. Filtering is the process of eliminating conducted interference
by controlling the spectral content of the conducted path. Filtering is the last step in the EMI design process.
Grounding
Grounding Principles
The three fundamental grounding techniques—ﬂoating, single-point, and multiple-point—are illustrated in
Figure 19.2.
Floating grounds are used to isolate circuits or equipment from a common ground plane. Static charges are
a hazard with this type of ground. Dangerous voltages may develop or a noise-producing discharge might
occur. Generally, bleeder resistors are used to control the static problem. Floating grounds are useful only at
low frequencies where capacitive coupling paths are negligible.
The single-point ground is a single physical point in a circuit. By connecting all grounds to a common
point, no interference will be produced in the equipment because the conﬁguration does not result in potential
differences across the equipment. At high frequencies care must be taken to prevent capacitive coupling, which
will result in interference.
A multipoint ground system exists when each ground connection is made directly to the ground plane at
the closest available point on it, thus minimizing ground lead lengths. A large conductive body is chosen for
the ground. Care must be taken to avoid ground loops.
Circuit grounding design is dependent on the function of each type of circuit. In unbalanced systems, care
must be taken to reduce the potential of common mode noise. Differential devices are commonly used to
suppress this form of noise. The use of high circuit impedances should be minimized. Where it cannot be
avoided, all interconnecting leads should be shielded, with the shield well grounded. Power supply grounding
must be done properly to minimize load inducted noise on a power supply bus. When electromechanical
relays are used in a system, it is best that they be provided with their own power supplies.

Cable shield grounding must be designed based upon the frequency range, impedance levels (whether
balanced or unbalanced) and operating voltage and/or current. Cross-talk between cables is a major problem
and must be carefully considered during the design process.
Building facility grounds must be provided for electrical faults, signal, and lightning. The fault protection
(green wire) subsystem is for the protection of personnel and equipment from the hazards of electrical power
faults and static charge buildup. The lightning protection system consists of air terminals (lightning rods), heavy
duty down-conductors, and ground rods. The signal reference subsystem provides a ground for signal circuits
to control static charges and noise and to establish a common reference between signals and loads. Earth grounds
may consist of vertical rods, horizontal grids or radials, plates, or incidental electrodes such as utility pipes or
buried tanks. The latter must be constructed and tested to meet the design requirements of the facility.
Grounding Design Guidelines
The following design guidelines represent good practice but should be applied subject to the detailed design
objectives of the system.
Fundamental Concepts
. Use single-point grounding for circuit dimensions less than 0.03 l (wavelength) and multipoint
grounding for dimensions greater than 0.15 l.
. The type of grounding for circuit dimensions between 0.03 and 0.15 l depends on the physical
arrangement of the ground leads as well as the conducted emission and conducted susceptibility limits
of the circuits to be grounded. Hybrid grounds may be needed for circuits that must handle a broad
portion of the frequency spectrum.
. Apply ﬂoating ground isolation techniques (i.e., transformers) if ground loop problems occur.
. Keep all ground leads as short as possible.
. Design ground reference planes so that they have high electrical conductivity and can be maintained
easily to retain good conductivity.
Safety Considerations
. Connect test equipment grounds directly to the grounds of the equipment being tested.
. Make certain the ground connections can handle fault currents that might ﬂow unexpectedly.
Circuit Grounding
. Maintain separate circuit ground systems for signal returns, signal shield returns, power system returns,
and chassis or case grounds. These returns then can be tied together at a single ground reference point.
. For circuits that produce large, abrupt current variations, provide a separate grounding system, or
provide a separate return lead to the ground to reduce transient coupling into other circuits.
. Isolate the grounds of low-level circuits from all other grounds.
. Where signal and power leads must cross, make the crossing so that the wires are perpendicular to each
other.
. Use balanced differential circuitry to minimize the effects of ground circuit interference.
. For circuits whose maximum dimension is signiﬁcantly less than l/4, use tightly twisted wires (either
shielded or unshielded, depending on the application) that are single-point grounded to minimize
equipment susceptibility.
Cable Grounding
. Avoid pigtails when terminating cable shields.
. When coaxial cable is needed for signal transmission, use the shield as the signal return and ground at
the generator end for low-frequency circuits. Use multipoint grounding of the shield for high-frequency
circuits.
. Provide multiple shields for low-level transmission lines. Single-point grounding of each shield is
recommended.

Shielding
The control of near- and far-ﬁeld coupling (radiation) is accomplished using shielding techniques. The ﬁrst
step in the design of a shield is to determine what undesired ﬁeld level may exist at a point with no
shielding and what the tolerable ﬁeld level is. The difference between the two then is the needed shielding
effectiveness.
This section discusses the shielding effectiveness of various solid and nonsolid materials and their
application to various shielding situations. Penetrations and their design are discussed so that the
required shielding effectiveness is maintained. Finally, common shielding effectiveness testing methods are
reviewed.
Enclosure Theory
The attenuation provided by a shield results from three loss mechanisms as illustrated in Figure 19.3:
1. Incident energy is reﬂected (R) by the surface of the shield because of the impedance discontinuity of the
air–metal boundary. This mechanism does not require a particular material thickness but simply an
impedance discontinuity.
2. Energy that does cross the boundary (not reﬂected) is attenuated (A) in passing through the shield.
3. The energy that reaches the opposite face of the shield encounters another air–metal boundary and thus
some of it is reﬂected (B) back into the shield. This term is only signiﬁcant when A , 15 dB and is
generally neglected because the barrier thickness is generally great enough to exceed the 15-dB loss rule
of thumb.
Thus:
S ¼ R þ A þ B dB
ð19:1Þ
Absorption loss is independent of the type of wave (electric/magnetic) and is given by
A ¼ 1:314ð f mrsrÞ1=2d dB
ð19:2Þ
where d is shield thickness in centimeters, mr is relative permeability, f is frequency in Hz, and sr is
conductivity of metal relative to that of copper. Typical absorption loss is provided in Table 19.1.

Shielding effectiveness is the result of three loss mechanisms.

Reﬂection loss is a function of the intrinsic impedance of the metal boundary with respect to the wave
impedance, and therefore, three conditions exist: near-ﬁeld magnetic, near-ﬁeld electric, and plane wave.

Figure 19.4 illustrates the shielding effectiveness of a variety of common materials versus various thicknesses
for a source distance of 1 m. This is the shielding effectiveness of a six-sided enclosure. To be useful, the
enclosure must be penetrated for various services or devices. This is illustrated in Figure 19.5(a) for small
enclosures and Figure 19.5(b) for room-sized enclosures.
Shielding Penetrations
Total shielding effectiveness of an enclosure is a function of the basic shield and all of the leakages associated
with the penetrations in the enclosure. The latter includes seams, doors, vents, control shafts, piping, ﬁlters,
windows, screens, and fasteners.

Compatibility

The design of the seams is a function of the type of enclosure and the level and nature of the shielding
effectiveness required. For small instruments, computers, and similar equipment, the typical shielding
required is on the order of 60 dB for electric and plane wave shielding. EMI gaskets are commonly used to
seal the openings in sheet metal construction. In some high-performance applications the shielding is
achieved using very tight-ﬁtting machined housings. Examples are IF strips and large dynamic range log
ampliﬁer circuits. Various methods of sealing joints are illustrated in Figure 19.6. EMI gasketing methods
are shown in Figure 19.7. For large room-sized enclosures, the performance requirements typically range
from 60 to 120 dB. Conductive EMI shielding tape is used in the 60-dB realm, clamped seams for 80 to
100 dB, and continuous welded seams for 120-dB performance. These are illustrated in Figure 19.8.
A good electromagnetic shielded door design must meet a variety of physical and electrical requirements.
Figure 19.9 illustrates a number of ways this is accomplished.

Compatibility

For electronic equipment, a variety of penetrations must be made to make the shielded volume functional.
These include control shafts, windows, lights, ﬁlters, and displays. Careful design is required to maintain the
required shielding integrity.
Shield Testing
The most common speciﬁcation used for shield evaluation is the procedure given in MIL-STD-285. This
consists of establishing a reference level without the shield and then enclosing the receiver within the shield
and determining the difference. The ratio is the shielding effectiveness. This applies regardless of materials used
in the construction of the shield. Care must be taken in evaluating the results since the measured value is a
function of a variety of factors, not all of which are deﬁnable.
Summary of Good Shielding Practice
Shielding Effectiveness
. Good conductors, such as copper and aluminum, should be used for electric ﬁeld shields to obtain high
reﬂection loss. A shielding material thick enough to support itself usually provides good electric
shielding at all frequencies.
. Magnetic materials, such as iron and special high-permeability alloys, should be used for magnetic ﬁeld
shields to obtain high absorbtion loss.
. In the plane wave region, the sealing of all apertures is critical to good shielding practice.
Multiple Shields
. Multiple shields are quite useful where high degrees of shielding effectiveness are required.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Shield Seams
. All openings or discontinuities should be addressed in the design process to ensure achievement of the
required shielding effectiveness. Shield material should be selected not only from a shielding require-
ment, but also from electrochemical corrosion and strength considerations.
. Whenever system design permits, use continuously overlapping welded seams. Obtain intimate contact
between mating surfaces over as much of the seam as possible.
. Surfaces to be mated must be clean and free from nonconducting ﬁnishes, unless the bonding process
positively and effectively cuts through the ﬁnish. When electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and ﬁnish
speciﬁcations conﬂict, the ﬁnishing requirements must be modiﬁed.
Case Construction
. Case material should have good shielding properties.
. Seams should be welded or overlapped.
. Panels and cover plates should be attached using conductive gasket material with closely spaced
fasteners.
. Mating surfaces should be cleaned just before assembly to ensure good electrical contact and to
minimize corrosion.
. A variety of special devices are available for sealing around doors, vents, and windows.
. Internal interference generating circuits must be isolated both electrically and physically. Electrical
isolation is achieved by circuit design; physical isolation may be achieved by proper shielding.
. For components external to the case, use EMI boots on toggle switches, EMI rotary shaft seals on rotary
shafts, and screening and shielding on meters and other indicator faces.
Cable Shields
. Cabling that penetrates a case should be shielded and the shield should be terminated in a peripheral
bond at the point of entry. This peripheral bond should be made to the connector or adaptor shell.
Filtering
An electrical ﬁlter is a combination of lumped or distributed circuit elements arranged so that it has a
frequency characteristic that passes some frequencies and blocks others.
Filters provide an effective means for the reduction and suppression of electromagnetic interference as
they control the spectral content of signal paths. The application of ﬁltering requires careful consideration of
an extensive list of factors, including insertion loss, impedance, power handling capability, signal distortion,
tunability, cost, weight, size, and rejection of undesired signals. Often they are used as stopgap measures, but
if suppression techniques are used early in the design process, then the complexity and cost of interference
ﬁxes can be minimized. There are many textbooks on ﬁltering, which should be used for speciﬁc
applications.
The types of ﬁlters are classiﬁed according to the band of frequencies to be transmitted or attenuated. The
basic types illustrated in Figure 19.10 include low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandstop (reject).
Filters can be composed of lumped, distributed, or dissipative elements; the type used is mainly a function
of frequency.
Filtering Guidance
. It is best to ﬁlter at the interference source.
. Suppress all spurious signals.
. Design nonsusceptible circuits.
. Ensure that all ﬁlter elements interface properly with other EMC elements, i.e., proper mounting of a
ﬁlter in a shielded enclosure.

Filter Design
Filters using lumped and distributive elements generally are reﬂective, in that the various component combi-
nations are designed for high series impedance and low shunt impedance in the stopband while providing low
series impedance and high shunt impedance in the passband.
The impedance mismatches associated with the use of reﬂective ﬁlters can result in an increase of interfer-
ence. In such cases, the use of dissipative elements is found to be useful. A broad range of ferrite components
are available in the form of beads, tubes, connector shells, and pins. A very effective method of low-pass
ﬁltering is to form the ferrite into a coaxial geometry, the properties of which are proportional to the length of
the ferrite, as shown in Figure 19.11.
Application of ﬁltering takes many forms. A common problem is transient suppression as illustrated in
Figure 19.12. All sources of transient interference should be treated at the source.
Power line ﬁltering is recommended to eliminate conducted interference from reaching the powerline and
adjacent equipment. Active ﬁltering is very useful in that it can be built in as part of the circuit design and can
be effective in passing only the design signals. A variety of noise blankers, cancelers, and limiter circuits are
available for active cancellation of interference.
Special Filter Types
A variety of special-purpose ﬁlters are used in the design of electronic equipment. Transmitters require a
variety of ﬁlters to achieve a noise-free output.
Receive preselectors play a useful role in interference rejection. Both distributed (cavity) and lumped
element components are used.
IF ﬁlters control the selectivity of a receiving system and use a variety of mechanical and electrical ﬁltering
components.

Spectrum, Speciﬁcations, and Measurement Techniques
Halit Eren and Bert Wong
The electromagnetic energy, created by moving or oscillating charges, propagates in air with a velocity of
300,000 km/sec. Electromagnetic energy may be generated intentionally (e.g., by communication systems) or
unintentionally (e.g., by power lines). Generally, all electrical and electronic devices create some form of
unintentional electromagnetic energy due to inductive and capacitive properties of the circuits. In some cases,
this energy interferes with the operation of other devices, termed as the electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Minimization or elimination of the EMI from devices and systems is a concern for electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC). The EMC may be deﬁned as the capability of two or more devices to operate
simultaneously without mutual interference.
19-13
Compatibility

Because of the increasing number of man-made EMI generated devices and systems around the globe,
allowable limits as well as measurement techniques on the EMC are set and regulated by authorities at national
and international levels. The problems or the potential problems that can be caused due to emission and
susceptibility of devices and systems have led to numerous standards and regulations worldwide. The Federal
Communication Commission (FCC), the U.S. Military, and the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) are few examples of the organizations that develop and maintain standards on EMC.
Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuum of all electromagnetic waves arranged according to frequency
and wavelength. The frequency spectrum of electromagnetic energy can span from dc to gamma ray (1021 Hz)
and beyond. Table 19.2 gives the approximate wavelengths, frequencies and the radiated energy levels for a
limited range of electromagnetic spectrum. Figure 19.13 illustrates the typical frequency spectrum chart over a
fraction of Hertz to 6 · 1022 Hz.
The frequency spectrum of interest for EMC purposes ranges from extreme low frequency (ELF) of a few
Hertz well into microwave bands (40 GHz and beyond). Low frequencies are the primary concern of biological
research, industrial equipment, and low frequency communication devices, while high frequencies are concern
for most analogue and digital electronic equipment, and devices used by the military and in the health
industry.

Spectrum Speciﬁcations
Spectrum speciﬁcations that are allocated by the FCC are generally accepted as the norm by other
organizations and countries. Although there are many other organizations concerned with the allocation of
spectrum, the FCC will be examined in detail here. The FCC is an independent United States Government
agency, directly responsible to Congress. The Ofﬁce of Engineering and Technology (OET) advises the
Commission concerning engineering matters. The main mission of the OET is to manage the spectrum and
create new opportunities for competitive technologies and services.
The FCC sets limits on the amount of electromagnetic radiation allowed to be emitted from commercial
electronic equipment. Any electronic device capable of emitting radio frequency (RF) energy by radiation or
conduction is deﬁned as a RF device and is required to comply with the standards. The relevant limits and
some measurement techniques, along with equipment authorization procedures, are given in the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 47 on telecommunications. The FCC rules are located in Parts 2, 5, 15, and 18
of the Title; these are:
Part 2 — Frequency allocations and radio treaty matters; general rules and regulations
Part 5 — Experimental radio service (other than broadcast)
Part 15 — RF devices
Part 18 — Industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical equipment
Title 47 — Part 15 contains three categories of equipment: (1) incidental radiators (such as dc motors,
mechanical light switches, etc.) that are not subject to FCC Part 15 emission control requirements;
(2) unintentional radiators that are RF devices that intentionally generate RF energy for use within the device,
but they are not intended to emit RF energy outside the device by radiation or induction; and (3) intentional
radiators that are RF devices that intentionally radiate RF energy by radiation or by induction.
In Title 47, ﬁve different types of equipment authorization procedures are listed: type acceptance, type
approval, notiﬁcation, certiﬁcation, and veriﬁcation. Restrictions are placed on the marketing and sale of all
RF devices until the appropriate equipment authorization criteria are met.
Devices and systems that require allocation of the frequency spectrum fall under either type acceptance or
type approval equipment authorization procedures. These are the RF devices that usually radiate high
powers as in the radio and television broadcast transmitters. RF devices not within the allocated part of the
RF spectrum would require either certiﬁcation or veriﬁcation equipment authorization. Some receivers,
such as pagers, require notiﬁcation and equipment authorization as well. It is recommended that the CFR,
Title 47, be consulted for the compliance if the device in question intentionally radiates energy in the
listed bands. Requirement for these types of devices are detailed in Part 15 of the CFR and, summarized in
Table 19.3.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
Electromagnetic compatibility is the ability of a device or system to function satisfactorily without introducing
intolerable disturbances on other devices or systems that are operating simultaneously in the same
environment. The EMC has two main components: (1) EMI, which is the ability of a device or a system to
operate without emitting too much electromagnetic energy that may cause harm to other devices; and
(2) electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS), which is the ability of a device or system to reject interference and
operate without being interfered by others. Susceptibility implies immunity, that is, a nonsusceptible device is
immune to interference. Mathematically, the EMC can be expressed as
EMC ¼ EMI þ EMS
Most practical EMC problems fall into four main key areas: emission, disturbances, RF interface, and
electrostatic discharges.
19-15
Compatibility

Emission refers to electromagnetic energy originating within a device or a system that can interfere with
other equipment or systems. Emissions are best addressed at the design stages of equipment. Strategies include
suitable printed circuit board design techniques, ﬁltering of unwanted frequencies, using shielded cables and
enclosures, and so on.
Disturbances are caused in the power distribution systems and the mains that take many different forms,
such as short transients, frequency and waveform variations, fast transients, RF on the power lines, etc. Some
of the solutions can include proper grounding, use of power ﬁlters, and installation of transient protectors.
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) refers to the sudden discharge of electrical charges that occur after a gradual
buildup. Static discharges are in the form of electric current, and almost instantaneous. Extremely fast
discharge results in emission of high frequency electromagnetic energy that spans well into the ultra high
frequency (UHF) ranges. For example, a 1-nsec discharge can cause electromagnetic waves with frequencies
over 300 MHz. Because of intense electromagnetic ﬁelds, the ESD is known to severely upset many devices and
systems located at distances of 5 to 10 m. Solutions to ESD problems may include transient protection, high-
frequency ﬁltering, proper cable and enclosure shielding.
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a very common problem. The RFI interference problem is expected
to grow due to a wide proliferation of handheld communication devices worldwide. Also, wider application of
wireless local area networks (LANs) is likely to intensify this problem still further. Solutions to the RFI may
include high frequency ﬁltering, using shielded cables, effective shielding of the enclosures, and so on.
Analogue devices are known to demonstrate a particular vulnerability to RFI. The RF interface can be viewed
to take place in two forms, these being near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld.

Near-ﬁeld (also known as electric and magnetic ﬁelds) are located less than about 1/6 wavelength from the
source. In this region, the reactive energy dominates and it can be divided into electric ﬁelds and magnetic
ﬁelds, both dependent on the source and circuit impedance.
Far-ﬁeld (also known as the plane wave ﬁeld) is located greater than about 1/6 wavelength from the source.
Plane waves have electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld components propagating as shown in Figure 19.14. Once this
takes place, the propagation is independent of the source and has constant wave impedance (ratio of electric
ﬁeld intensity to magnetic ﬁeld intensity) of 377 O in free space.
Determination of EMC
A common EMI problem is gathering information about the characteristics of the electromagnetic waves and
organizing data. For this purpose, the source–path–receptor model (Figure 19.15) is the most popular method.
The three elements of this method are:
1. Source is the emitter of energy
2. Receptor is the device affected by the energy emitted by the source
3. Coupling path is the link (media) between the source and the receptor
For EMI to take place all three elements must exist at the same time. The objectives of the EMC standards
and regulations are to minimize the unwanted generation of energy, block the energy from reaching the
receptor, and to minimize the susceptibility or increase the immunity of the receptor.
In the determination of the EMC, the key metric is the ﬁeld intensity measured in volt/meter (V/m). In its
simpliﬁed form, the intensity may be expressed as a function of transmitter power, and distance from the
emitting source, as
E ¼ 5:5
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
PA
p
=d ðV=mÞ
where P is the transmitter power in watts, A is the antenna gain, and d is the distance from the source.
As an example, the ﬁeld intensity at a distance of 1 m from a 1 W transmitter with antenna gain of 1 is
about 5.5 V/m, while the electric ﬁeld from a 10 kW broadcast station at a 1-km distance can be calculated to

be 0.55 V/m. This example shows that the distance of the receptor from the offending source is very
signiﬁcant.
Shielding: Many systems require shielding to meet emission and immunity requirements. Shielding involves
two independent mechanisms, reﬂection and absorption. In reﬂection, an electromagnetic wave bounces off the
surface. In absorption, the electromagnetic wave penetrates the material and is absorbed as it passes through.
Although much more complex, the effectiveness of shielding can be expressed simply by
SE ðdBÞ ¼ R ðdBÞ þ A ðdBÞ
where SE is the total shielding effectiveness in dB, R and A are the reﬂections and absorptions, respectively.
Reﬂection is the key mechanism for high frequency shielding (emission, RFI, ESD), while absorption is the
main mechanism for low frequency shielding.
EMC Standards, Regulations, and Organizations
Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that can propagate through a medium. It can be generated
intentionally or unintentionally and can interface with electronic systems, instruments, and other working
equipment, thus degrading their performance. Therefore standards and regulations are set by many
organizations to control the EMC problems. The related standards and regulations can be divided into three
major groups; EMC in general, emission, and immunity. The application areas of the speciﬁc groups may
differ greatly, as listed below:
(a) Domestic radio and television receivers
(b) Domestic appliances and household electronic equipment
(c) Mobile radio equipment
(d) Mobile radio and commercial radiotelephone equipment
(e) Radio and television broadcast transmitters
(f) Information technology equipment
(g) Telecommunications networks and equipment
(h) Educational electronic equipment
(i) Medical and scientiﬁc equipment
(j) Aeronautical and marine radio equipment
(k) Industrial manufacturing equipment
(l) Lights and ﬂuorescent lamps, etc.
Each one of these speciﬁc groups may further be divided into application areas, e.g.:
. Vehicles
. Earth moving machinery
. Space systems
. Agricultural and forestry machinery
. Lifts, escalators, conveyors, etc.
Some EMC standards and regulatory organizations specialize with a particular group of applications while
others have much wider interests. In general, the organization responsible for EMC can be divided into three
main groups: (1) international organizations, (2) regional organizations, and (3) national and professional
organizations.
International Standards Organizations
There are a number of international organizations that are involved in EMC standards, some of which include
the International Electrotechnic Commission (EIC), International Standards Organization (ISO), Interna-
tional Telecommunication Union (ITU), and International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML). Another
organization of importance is the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR), which was
19-18
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

established in 1934 by a group of international organizations to address radio interference. CISPR is a
nongovernmental group composed of National Committees of the IEC. The operations of the IEC and ISO
will brieﬂy be explained next.
The IEC speciﬁes the general conditions or rules necessary for achieving electromagnetic compatibility. The
IEC 61000 series deals with terminology, descriptions of electromagnetic phenomena, measurement and testing
techniques, and guidelines on installation and mitigation. The IEC standards consist of nine parts as follows:
Part 1: General
– General considerations (introduction, fundamental principles, safety)
– Deﬁnitions, terminology
Part 2: Environment
– Description of the environment
– Classiﬁcation of the environment
– Compatibility levels
Part 3: Limits
– Emission limits
– Immunity limits
Part 4: Testing and measurement techniques
– Measurement techniques and testing techniques
Part 5: Installation and mitigation guidelines
– Installation guidelines
– Mitigation methods and devices
Part 6: Generic standards
Part 7: Open
Part 8: Open
Part 9: Miscellaneous
Among many others, some of the recent publications of the IEC and CISPR are given in Table 19.4.
The ISO forms committees and teams from national delegations nominated by the member institutes of the
countries concerned with the EMC. The ISO rules state that the member institutions are expected to take
account of the views of a broad range of interested parties and other stakeholders so that acceptance of the
proposal becomes a consolidated and national consensus.
Some of the recent publications of the ISO on the EMC are given in Table 19.5.
Regional Standards Organizations
The main regional standards organizations concerned with the EMC are from the European Union (EU).
Recently, European nations have introduced the European Standard Organization (ESO) to unify access to
information on standards and the routes into the standardization process. The ESO plays a signiﬁcant role in
aligning commercial, judicial, and ﬁnancial objectives within the community. There are 25 countries that
participate in the EU who have agreed to the common regulatory requirements placed on commercial products.

Compatibility

These agreements, called directives, are listed in the Ofﬁcial Journal of the European Council (OJEC). In a recent
publication (31st March, 2004), the OJEC states that it is desirable to harmonize standards of all EU countries. To
this end, the European Committee of Standardization (CEN), The European Committee of Electrotechnical
Standardization (CENELEC), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) are recognized
as the main bodies for adoption and harmonization of standards in accordance with the general guidelines.
The EU approves standards on EMC with the preﬁx EN (from European Norm). The development of EMC
standards is an ongoing process in all countries but Europeans face an additional problem of harmonization of
practice common to all member countries. For example, the CENELEC 50000 series of standards deals with
terminology and descriptions of standards, and measurement and testing techniques in particular
applications, which have been adopted across the board.
The European organizations have many publications on the EMC standards generated from CENELEC,
CEN, and ETSI, some of which are listed in Table 19.6.
There are other regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but
they are not as effective as the European organizations on EMC matters.
National and Professional Organizations
Almost every nation has its own standards organization concerned with EMC. In the U.S., the FCC and the
military (MIL) are the two regulating bodies for the allocation of spectrums. In the U.S., there are also other
organizations such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineering (IEEE), and others who are directly involved in EMC standards. In Europe, each
country has its own EMC governing body as well as its own standards. Deutsches Institut fu¨r Normung (DIN)
in Germany, British Standards Institute (BSI) in Britain, and Ente Nazionale Italiano di Uniﬁcazione (UNI) in
Italy are among these. Organizations such as the Standards Council of Canada (SCC), Standards Australia
(SAA), and the China Electronics Standardization Institute (CESI) are other organizations that are scattered
around the globe. Here, only few examples will be provided.
The Australian EMC/EMI standards closely follow CISPR models. Since 1992, Australia and New Zealand
have adopted joint national standards that carry the preﬁx AS/NZS. The newer EMC standards are generally
similar to those of CISPR or CENELEC, with some deviations. In Australia, empowered by the
Radiocommunications Act of 1992, the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) had been developing EMC

Some of the recent Australian/New Zealand publications on the EMC standards are given Table 19.7.
The Canadian EMC/EMI standards are controlled by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).
A particular branch of the SCC, the Canadian Electrical Code, is dedicated to harmonized electrically related
standards. Some of the recent Canadian publications on the EMC standards are listed in Table 19.8.
The U.S. EMC/EMI standards are developed by various government, private, and professional organizations
such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineering (IEEE), and several other bodies. ANSI, for example, is a private, nonproﬁt organization that
administers and coordinates U.S. voluntary standardization and conformity assessment systems. It has
approximately 1000 companies, organizations, government agencies, institutional, and international members.
The IEEE, however, is a professional organization with visions of promoting the engineering processes of
creating, developing, integrating, sharing, and applying knowledge about electronic and information
technologies and sciences. ANSI and IEEE are active in developing and maintaining EMC standards, some of
which are listed in Table 19.9.
The U.S. Military has its own standards and requirements related to EMI and susceptibility, as described in
the MIL-STD-461C documents. Electromagnetic interference is deﬁned as the radiated and conducted energy
emitted from any device. Electromagnetic susceptibility is deﬁned as the amount of radiated or conducted
energy that the device can withstand without degrading its performance.
The standards are broken down into 17 segments deﬁned by a two-letter sufﬁx code and followed by
three numbers ranging from 101 to 999 in the requirement name. The letter codes are: conducted emissions
(CE), conducted susceptibility (CS), radiated emission (RE), and radiated susceptibility (RS). Table 19.10 is a
list of descriptions of the different emission and susceptibility requirements for a particular branch or type
of application.

Testing requirements of equipment in each segment are different. For example, from Table 19.6, RE102
encompasses electric ﬁelds in the frequency bands of the testing requirements, typically from 10 kHz to
18 GHz, depending on the clock frequency of the device or types of platforms (described in Table 19.11). Up
to 30 MHz, only the vertical polarization of the electric ﬁeld will be measured and compared with the limits.
Above 30 MHz, horizontal and vertical ﬁeld components must be measured and again compared with the
limits. The device is in conformance with RE102 if the electric ﬁeld intensity in the appropriate frequency
band is less than the prescribed limit.
Some U.S. military standards are given in Table 19.12.
Measurement Techniques
In many applications, the measurement of electrical and magnetic ﬁelds to determine the intensity of radiated
and conducted coupling is essential. The maximum stray ﬁeld strengths that cause no EMI are incorporated in

the standards and regulations explained above. The procedure for determining emission and susceptibility
levels is well established. There are many private and government organizations around the globe that are
qualiﬁed to conduct measurements. Each country may adopt its own measurement guidelines.
Measurement of electromagnetic radiation is regulated by various standards, such as CISPR 22 of the IEC,
FCC Part 15 of the U.S., ICES 003 of Canada, VCCI-V series of Japan, EN 55022 and IEC/CISPR 22 of the EU,
AS 3548 of Australia, CNS 13438 of China, etc. Measurements are for conducted emission, radiated emission,
ESD and transient immunity, surge immunity, and RF immunity, and are necessary for: (1) diagnostic
purposes, (2) precompliance requirements, (3) full compliance requirements, and (4) production purposes.
Electromagnetic radiation has two perpendicularly propagating components: the electric ﬁeld and the
magnetic ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld, E, is normally expressed in volts per meter (V/m). The magnetic ﬁeld, H, is
expressed in amperes per meter (A/m). A source may generate electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In the near-ﬁeld
the ratio of E and H varies greatly, approaching inﬁnity for an electric ﬁeld source or zero for a magnetic ﬁeld
source. For example, near a magnetic ﬁeld source, the electric ﬁeld is weak, but becomes stronger at distances
larger than 1/6th if the wavelength, the ratio of E and H approaches to a constant 377 O. This is also applicable
for an electric ﬁeld source.
Electromagnetic emission measurements can be conducted for near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld. In the near-ﬁeld
regions, E and H, the ﬁelds must be measured separately. The far-ﬁeld strengths are normally measured in
terms of E ﬁelds. Alternatively, the far-ﬁeld strength may be speciﬁed in terms of power density, expressed in
watts per square meter. The power density denotes the amount of radiated power passing through each square
meter of a surface perpendicular to the direction away from the source. The peak-power density is known to be
equal to E · H, and, for a sinusoidal source, the average power density is half of this value. For sinusoidal
sources, each frequency component must be considered separately. The total average power can be determined
as the sum of the average powers for all frequencies. It follows that the total average power is P ¼ E2/377 W.
An important factor that merits attention during the far-ﬁeld measurements is polarization. The
propagating electromagnetic ﬁelds may be oriented at many different angles with respect to the surface of the
Earth. The direction of the electric ﬁeld is called the polarization of the wave, which may be vertical,
horizontal, or something in between. The wave may be elliptically polarized, which may result from two waves
that are not exactly in phase. If the waves are equal in magnitude and exactly 90– out of phase, the wave is
circularly polarized. To account for all these cases, the ﬁeld must be checked separately for vertically and
horizontally polarized waves.
In general, conducted emissions and radiated emissions measurements are taken below and above the
30 MHz mark, respectively. Although this mark is not absolute, spurious measurements can occur. At higher
frequencies, above 30 MHz, resonance becomes dominant in typical cable lengths, disturbing conducted
emission measurements. In the case of radiated emissions measurements, it is easier to capture the far-ﬁeld
characteristics as the equipment under test (EUT) becomes an effective radiator. At lower frequencies, below
30 MHz, near-ﬁeld probes are required to target hot-spots, as capturing such complex radiation ﬁeld patterns
can be very involved and difﬁcult.
There are three important considerations in electromagnetic ﬁeld measurement: the measurement
environment, the antenna and backup equipment, and software (illustrated in Figure 19.16).
Measurement Environment
A major difﬁculty in electromagnetic ﬁeld measurement is the repeatability of results. Electromagnetic ﬁelds
are affected by materials in the vicinity; therefore the measurement environment must carefully be deﬁned and
maintained for repeatability.
Measurements can be conducted in large outdoor areas, called open-ﬁeld sites. Assuming that the
conductivity, permittivity, and permeability of the Earth are constant, every open-ﬁeld site would have the
same effect on electromagnetic ﬁelds radiated from the equipment under test (EUT). Once compensated for
the reﬂections by using ground planes, the radiated energy must be measured in all directions from the EUT,
at various angles of inclination of the receiving antenna. However, open-ﬁeld measurements are prone to
interference from other sources emitting electromagnetic energy. To avoid interference from stray sources, tests
can be conducted inside shielded enclosures.
19-23
Compatibility

An ideal test environment is a shielded enclosure lined with material that does not reﬂect electromagnetic
waves. Such an enclosure is called an anechoic chamber. Another type of test chamber is the transverse
electromagnetic cell (TEM), which consists of an enlarged section of waveguide. TEMs are suitable for testing
small devices at relatively low frequencies. Shielded rooms also are used in measurement.
Antennas
Antennas are simple conductors that respond to electric ﬁelds and provide voltage and current at the
terminals. There are many different types, such as dipole antennas, biconical antennas, log-periodic antennas,
spiral antennas, etc. Most antennas are linearly polarized since they respond to only one polarization
component of the propagating wave. That is, if the antenna is oriented horizontally, only the horizontally
polarized component of the wave will affect it. The correct use of antennas in electromagnetic measurements is
very important since antenna factors, matching, balancing, and such play important roles in the accuracy of
the results.
Backup Equipment and Software
Backup equipment for electromagnetic measurements mainly consists of ampliﬁers, tracking generators,
spectrum analyzers, quasi-peak detectors, near-ﬁeld probes, ﬁeld strength meters, computers, and appropriate
software support. All the necessary components are commercially available from many companies. However,
correct selection of equipment is necessary as they have different power handling capacities and frequencies of
operation, and other characteristics. Here, only the spectrum analyzer and quasi-peak detectors will brieﬂy be
explained.
The spectrum analyzer: A standard EMC test measurement generally requires a measuring receiver or
spectrum analyzer. Spectrum analyzers are useful devices to quickly and reliably scan a range of frequencies
during diagnostic tests. They are considerably cheaper than measuring receivers but lack dynamic range and
are prone to overload. A typical spectrum analyzer has the following features: frequency range 9 kHz to
22 GHz, maximum resolution 30 Hz, noise level 102 to 127 dBm.
The performance of a spectrum analyzer can be facilitated with a preselector, also known as a preampliﬁer,
connected to the front end. A preselector has input protection, preampliﬁcation, and a sweep-tuned ﬁlter
locked to the local oscillator of the spectrum analyzer. Some of the more sophisticated spectrum analyzers
come with a built-in tracking generator or with an option to incorporate one into the system. A tracking
generator is basically a signal generator in which its output frequency tracks the measurement frequency and
sweeps at the same rate. The measurement uncertainty is typically ^1 dB over the range 100 kHz to 1 GHz.
The quasi-peak detector is a peak detector with weighted charge and discharge times. A peak detector
functions by responding to the peak signal value and discharges at a fairly rapid rate, and usually applies to

military standards. Another detector commonly used in RF measurements is the average detector that averages
the measured signal. CISPR derivative EN55022 standards entail average detection on conducted emissions.
As expected, an interference signal measured at a given frequency relies on the bandwidth of the receiver
and response of its detector. As an example, commercially based CISPR emissions standards as in CISPR 16
deﬁne four measurement bands between 9 kHz and 1 GHz for quasi-peak detection. A summary is given in
Table 19.13.
Other Instruments are now available to fulﬁll the functionality of the spectrum analyzer. Instrumentation
manufacturers allow for add-on options to some of their models. For instance, there are oscilloscopes that are
able to convert the measured signal into its frequency representation. These devices are handy for quick
diagnostic purposes but have limitations in terms of stability, bandwidth, and sensitivity.
Most manufacturers offer complete test systems. A typical set has the following features:
. Antenna and cable test set with spectrum analyzer
. Frequency range 9 kHz to 3 GHz
. Broadband antenna and preampliﬁer
. E ﬁeld and H ﬁeld probes
. Interfering signal feature allows identiﬁcation and type of interference
. RS-232 port to interface with printers and computers
. Analysis software, Smith chart tools, etc.
Conclusions
Because of the increasing number of man-made EMI generated devices and systems, the problems caused by
the intentional and unintentional emission of electromagnetic energy have led numerous organizations
worldwide to set standards and regulations. Bodies such as the FCC set limits on the amount of
electromagnetic emissions, at certain frequency bands, from commercial electronic equipment. EMC/EMI can
be analyzed by the source–path–receptor model and carefully conducted measurements can reveal information
on the emission levels and susceptibility of receptors. There are well-established test procedures and a diverse
range of equipment to conduct measurements.

Lightning
Martin A. Uman
An understanding of lightning and of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced by lightning is critical to an
understanding of lightning-induced effects on communication and electric power systems. This section begins
with an overview of the terminology and physics of lightning; then statistics on lightning occurrences are
given. Next, the characteristics of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds resulting from lightning discharges and
currents are examined and the models used to describe that relationship are discussed. The section ends with a
discussion of the coupling of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from lightning to overhead wires.
Terminology and Physics
Lightning is a transient, high-current electric spark whose length is measured in kilometers. Lightning
discharges can occur within a cloud, between clouds, from cloud to air, and from cloud to ground. All
discharges except the latter are known as cloud discharges. The usual cloud-to-ground lightning is initiated in
the cloud, has a duration of about half a second, and carries to ground some 20 to 30 Coulombs of negative
cloud charge. A less frequent type of cloud-to-ground discharge, accounting for less than 10% of all cloud-to-
ground lightning, also begins in the cloud but lowers positive cloud charge. An even less frequent type of
cloud-to-ground lightning is initiated in an upward direction from tall man-made structures such as TV
towers or tall geographical features such as mountain tops. A complete lightning discharge of any type is called
a ﬂash. The usual negative cloud-to-ground lightning ﬂash starts in the cloud when a so-called preliminary
breakdown, a particular type of electric discharge in the cloud, occurs. This process is followed by an electrical
discharge, termed the stepped leader, which propagates toward the ground in a series of luminous steps having
tens of meters length. In progressing toward the ground, the negatively charged stepped leader branches in a
downward direction. When one or more leader branches approach within 100 m or so of the ground, after 10
to 20 msec of stepped leader travel at an average speed of 105 to 106 m/sec, the electric ﬁeld at the ground (or
at objects on the ground) increases above the critical breakdown ﬁeld of the surrounding air and one or more
upward-going discharges are initiated, starting the attachment process. After traveling a few tens of meters,
one of the upward-going discharges, which is essentially at ground potential, contacts the tip of one branch of
the stepped leader, which is at a high negative potential, probably some tens of megavolts. From that point,
ground potential propagates upward, discharging to ground some or all of the negative charge previously
deposited along the channel by the stepped leader. This upward propagating potential discontinuity is called
the return stroke. Its front is a region of high electric ﬁeld that causes increased ionization, current,
temperature, and pressure as it travels up the 5-km or more length of the leader channel. That trip is made in
about 100 msec at an initial speed on the order of one third to one half the speed of light, the speed decreasing
with height. The current at ground associated with the negative ﬁrst return stroke has a peak of typically 30 kA
achieved in a few microseconds, has a maximum current derivative of about 1011 A/sec and falls to half of peak
value in some tens of microseconds. The cessation of the ﬁrst return stroke current may or may not end the

ﬂash. If more cloud charge is made available to the ﬁrst stroke channel by in-cloud discharges, another leader-
return stroke sequence may ensue, typically after tens of milliseconds. Preceding and initiating a subsequent
return stroke is a negatively charged continuous leader called a dart leader. The dart leader typically propagates
down the residual channel of the previous stroke, generally ignoring the ﬁrst stroke branches, although in
about 50% of cloud-to-ground ﬂashes there is at least one dart leader which transforms to a stepped leader on
the downward trip, creating a new path to ground. There are typically three or four leader-return stroke
sequences per negative cloud-to-ground ﬂash, but ten or more is not uncommon.
Of the many different processes that occur during the various phases of a negative cloud-to-ground
lightning (e.g., the in-cloud K processes, in-cloud J processes, and cloud-to-ground M components that occur
between strokes and after the ﬁnal stroke and that are not discussed here), the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
associated with the return stroke described above generally are the largest and hence the most signiﬁcant in
inducing unwanted voltages in communication and electric power systems. This is the case because the
currents in all other lightning processes are generally smaller than return stroke currents and the ground strike
point of the return stroke can be much closer to objects on the ground than are in-cloud discharges. Cloud
discharges exhibit currents similar to those of the in-cloud processes occurring in ground discharges and
hence produce similar relatively small ﬁelds at or near ground level.
Positive ﬂashes to ground, those initiated in the cloud and conducting positive charge to earth, generally
contain only one return stroke, which is preceded by a ‘‘pulsating’’ leader rather than the stepped leader
characteristically preceding negative ﬁrst strokes and is generally followed by a period of continuous current
ﬂow. Positive ﬂashes contain a greater percentage of very large return stroke currents, in the 100- to 300-kA
range, than do negative ﬂashes. Positive ﬂashes may represent half of all ﬂashes to ground in winter storms,
which produce few total ﬂashes, and typically represent 1 to 20% of the overall ﬂashes in summer storms, that
percentage increasing with increasing latitude.
A complete discussion of all aspects of the physics of negative and positive lightning ﬂashes is found in
Rakov and Uman (2003).
Lightning Occurrence Statistics
Lightning ﬂash density is deﬁned as the number of lightning ﬂashes per unit time per unit area and is usually
measured in units of lightning ﬂashes, either cloud or cloud-to-ground or both, per square kilometer per year.
The two most common techniques for directly measuring ﬂash density are (1) the use of so-called ﬂash
counters, relatively crude devices which trigger on electric ﬁelds above a value of the order of 1 kV/m in a
frequency band centered in the hundreds of hertz to kilohertz range, of which two models have been used
extensively, the CIGRE 10-kHz and the CIGRE 500-Hz, and (2) the use of networks of wideband magnetic
direction ﬁnders, networks of wideband time-of-arrival detectors, and networks combining the two
technologies, such networks now covering the U.S., Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, most of Europe, and parts
of many other countries. The average ﬂash density varies considerably with geographical location, generally
increasing with decreasing latitude. Typical ground ﬂash densities are 1 to 5 km–2 yr–1, with the world’s highest
being 30 to 50 km–2 yr–1. Signiﬁcant variations in ﬂash density are observed with changes in local
meteorological conditions within distances of the order of 10 km, for example, perpendicular to and inland
from the Florida coastline. The ﬁrst ground ﬂash density map for the U.S. obtained from the National
Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) of 114 wideband magnetic direction ﬁnders, containing over 13
million ground ﬂashes that occurred in 1989, is given by Orville (1991). A ten-year ground ﬂash density map
(1989 to 1998) for the US is published in Figure 2.11 of Rakov and Uman (2003). There are on average about
25 million cloud-to-ground ﬂashes occurring annually over the contiguous US. Flash densities in the U.S. are
maximum in Florida with 10 to 15 km–2 yr–1 and minimum along portions of the Paciﬁc coast, which has
essentially no lightning.
An extensively measured parameter used to describe lightning activity worldwide is the thunderday or
isokeraunic level, TD, the number of days per year that thunder is heard at a given location. This parameter has
been recorded by weather station observers worldwide for many decades, whereas the relatively accurate direct
measurement of ﬂash density by networks of sensors (discussed above) has been possible only recently.
19-28
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Commonly used relations to convert thunderday level to ground ﬂash density Ng are of the form:
Ng ¼ aTb
D km2 yr1
ð19:6Þ
where the value of a is near, but usually less than 0.1 and the value of b is near, but usually greater than one. It
should be noted that Equation (19.6) may be relatively inaccurate for a given location or year in that the data
to which the formula is ﬁt are highly variable. The literature contains more than ten different values of a and b
determined in different studies.
Finally, from Earth-orbiting satellite measurements, it has been estimated that there are about 50 to 100
total ﬂashes, cloud and cloud-to-ground, per second over the whole Earth. This number corresponds to an
average global total ﬂash density of 3 to 6 km2 yr1. Rakov and Uman (2003) review the available satellite
observations and in their Figure 2.12 give a ﬂash density map for the world based on eight years of data from
two satellites.
Electric and Magnetic Fields
For the usual negative return stroke, measurements of the vertical component of the electric ﬁeld and the two
horizontal components of the magnetic ﬁeld at ground level using wideband systems with upper frequency
3-dB points in the 1- to 20-MHz range are well documented in the literature. Measured vertical electric ﬁeld
and horizontal magnetic ﬁeld waveshapes are shown in Figure 19.17. Sketches of typical electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are given in Figure 19.18 for lightning in the 1- to 5-km range and in Figure 19.19 for lightning at 10, 15,
50, and 200 km. Measured vertical and horizontal electric ﬁelds near ground are shown in Figure 19.20. The
mean value of the initial peak vertical electric ﬁeld, normalized to 100 km by assuming an inverse distance
dependence, is about 7 V/m for negative ﬁrst strokes and about 4 V/m for negative subsequent strokes.
The return stroke vertical electric ﬁeld rise to peak comprises
two distinguishable parts, evident in Figure 19.17: a slow front
immediately followed by a fast transition to peak. For ﬁrst
strokes the slow front has a duration of a few microseconds and
rises to typically half the peak amplitude, while for subsequent
strokes the same slow front lasts less than 1 msec and rises only to
typically 20% of the peak. The mean 10 to 90% fast transition
time is about 200 nsec regardless of stroke order for strokes
observed over saltwater, where there is minimal distortion of the
waveform due to propagation. The waveforms in Figure 19.17
have suffered distortion in propagation over land.
After the initial ﬁeld peak, the waveshapes of the vertical and
horizontal magnetic ﬁelds for close lightning exhibit a valley
followed by a hump in the case of the magnetic ﬁeld and by a
ramp in the case of the electric ﬁeld, as is evident from Figure
19.17 to Figure 19.20. Relative to the amplitude of the initial
peak, the hump and the ramp decrease with increasing distance
to the return stroke. For distances of 25 km or greater, the
ramp in the electric ﬁeld is no longer signiﬁcant, and for
distances of 50 km or more, and for times of the order of 100
msec, the waveshapes of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are
nearly identical, exhibiting a zero crossing and polarity reversal
at some tens of microseconds. For very close distances, of the
order of tens to hundreds of meters, triggered lightning
(lightning initiated by ﬁring small rockets trailing grounded
wires toward thunderstorms) exhibits a return stroke electric
ﬁeld waveshape that is more or less a step function with a

risetime on the order of a microsecond and a magnetic ﬁeld waveshape that is similar to the return stroke
current waveshape at ground level. Very close natural return stroke ﬁelds are likely similar.
For positive return strokes, there are more very large peak currents at the channel base, in the 100-kA range,
than for return strokes lowering negative charge to ground, although the median value for both positives and
negatives is not much different (Berger et al., 1975). This observation is supported by measurements of the

initial peak magnetic ﬁeld from positive and negative return strokes made with magnetic direction-ﬁnding
networks worldwide.
The horizontal component of the electric ﬁeld has not been as well studied or characterized as the vertical.
For the case of a ﬁnite-conducting earth and lightning beyond a few kilometers, Thomson et al. (1988) give
wideband measurements of the three perpendicular components of the electric ﬁeld about 1 m above ground
level. An example is shown in Figure 19.20. The horizontal ﬁeld waveshapes are more impulsive and vary on a
faster time scale than their associated vertical electric ﬁeld waveshapes. In fact, the horizontal ﬁeld appears to
be a crude derivative of the vertical. The peak amplitudes of the horizontal electric ﬁelds are on the order of 30
times smaller than those of the vertical ﬁelds for ground conductivities of the order of 102 mho/m, this ratio
being roughly proportional to the square root of the ground conductivity. The horizontal ﬁeld, although
considerably smaller for distant lightning, can be as important as the vertical electric ﬁeld in inducing voltages
on an overhead horizontal wire because of the greater horizontal extent of the wire relative to its height above
ground, a fact well established by recent research, whereas in the earlier literature on power line coupling, for
example, only the vertical ﬁeld was considered to be important.
The so-called wavetilt formula, given in Equation (19.7), models the ratio, in the frequency domain, of the
horizontal to vertical electric ﬁeld of a plane wave at the surface of Earth with conductivity s and permittivity
ere0 for the case of grazing incidence and is certainly applicable to lightning return strokes occurring beyond a
few kilometers, probably beyond a few hundred meters:

both computed for the case of a perfectly (subscript ‘‘p’’) conducting ground. The second term is equal to zero
for s ! 1 and becomes increasingly important as s decreases. A generalization of the Cooray–Rubinstein
formula has been offered by Wait (1997).
Apparently no horizontal or vertical electric ﬁelds very close to natural lightning, at distances of tens of
meters, necessary to the understanding of the voltages induced by very close lightning, have been published
(such very close ﬁelds have been measured for triggered lightning), although such close ﬁelds have been
calculated by Diendorfer (1990) and by Rubinstein et al. (1990) using different return stroke models. These
two sets of calculated ﬁelds are to be considered model-dependent estimates. Although there is disagreement
between the two studies as to the waveshape of ﬁelds and the signiﬁcance of the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite ground
conductivity at small distances, both studies yield horizontal ﬁeld amplitudes at the height of a typical power
distribution line comparable to the amplitude of the vertical ﬁeld. Note that no return stroke model used to
date (see next section) takes proper account of the attachment process referred to earlier and hence probably
none accurately models the ﬁelds at very early times. Further, the leader ﬁelds preceding the return stroke ﬁeld
change are not taken into account in the existing models, although such ﬁelds at very close range are clearly
important since it is the leader charge near ground that the return stroke discharges to ground, and hence the
leader and return stroke electrostatic ﬁeld changes are of equivalent magnitude very close to the ground strike
point (Rubinstein et al., 1995; Crawford et al., 2001).

Modeling the Return Stroke
General
Rakov and Uman (1998) review all types of return stroke models and rank the so-called ‘‘engineering’’ models
in terms of their validity and usefulness. For the engineering models, if the current at the channel base is
speciﬁed (e.g., from measurement) along with the model parameters, the channel current can be calculated as
a function of height and time, and thereafter the electric and magnetic ﬁelds computed from the channel
current. It is commonly assumed in these models that the lightning channel is perfectly straight and vertical
and that the ground is a perfect conductor. The remote electric and magnetic ﬁelds are calculated from
Equation (19.9) to Equation (19.15):

plane to take account of reﬂections from the earth’s surface. The three terms on the right-hand side of
Equation (19.9) (expanded in Equation (19.10) to Equation (19.12)) are called, from left to right, the
electrostatic, induction, and radiation terms. Similarly, the two terms on the right-hand side of Equation
(19.13) (expanded in Equation (19.14) and Equation (19.15)) are termed the induction and radiation terms.
19-33
Compatibility

For large distances from the lightning channel, the radiation part
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds is dominant due to its 1/R
dependence (as compared to the 1/R2 and 1/R3 dependencies of the
induction and electrostatic terms, respectively). By a similar
argument, for close distances, the dominant terms will be the
electrostatic term in the case of the electric ﬁeld and the induction
term for the magnetic ﬁeld. It can be readily shown from Equation
(19.9) to Equation (19.15) and the preceding discussion that for any
individual lightning return stroke model, the waveshapes of the
vertical electric ﬁeld and the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld are almost
identical for great distances, and this fact is also evident in the
experimental data (see Figure 19.19). Moreover, it can be shown
that for great distances, the ratio of the electric ﬁeld intensity E to
the magnetic ﬂux density B is the speed of light c.
A brief examination of return stroke current models follows. We discuss here only the transmission line
(TL) model and its modiﬁed versions (modiﬁed transmission line linear—MTLL, modiﬁed transmission line
exponential—MTLE) and the DU model of Diendorfer and Uman (1990) along with its modiﬁed version.
More details of all models are found in Rakov and Uman (2003), Thottappillil and Uman (1993), Nucci et al.
(1990), Diendorfer and Uman (1990), and Thottappillil et al. (1991), including ﬁelds calculated from the
various models. By assessing all published attempts at the validation of the various return stroke models,
Rakov and Uman (1998) conclude that for modeling the initial microsecond or so of the return stroke (up to
the initial ﬁeld peak) the TL model is preferred (see also Schoene et al., 2003, for a later validation); and, for
tens of microseconds of the return stroke, the ranking of the engineering models, with best ﬁrst, is MTLL, DU,
MTLE, BG, and TL.
The Transmission Line (TL) Model and Its Modiﬁed Versions
In the transmission line model it is assumed that the current waveform at the ground travels undistorted up
the lightning channel at a constant speed v. Mathematically, this current is represented by
iðz0; tÞ ¼ ið0; t  z0=vÞ
z05vt
iðz0; tÞ ¼ 0
z04 vt
ð19:16Þ
No charge is removed by the transmission line return stroke current along the channel since the charge
entering the bottom of any section of the channel leaves the top when the current reaches it. All the charge is
therefore transferred from the bottom to the top of the channel, an unrealistic situation given our knowledge
of lightning physics. Nevertheless, the TL model appears to be entirely adequate to model the ﬁelds for the ﬁrst
microsecond or so (Schoene et al., 2003).
Willett et al. (1989) have presented return stroke current, ﬁeld, and speed data from triggered lightning in
an attempt to validate the TL model. Using these data, Rakov et al. (1992) have shown, at least for strokes in
triggered lightning, that return stroke peak current can be derived from return stroke peak ﬁeld by the
expression I ¼ 1.5 – 0.037DE where the peak current I is in kA and is negative, the distance D is in km, and the
peak electric ﬁeld E is in V/m and is positive.
In the modiﬁed transmission line models, the upward propagating current given by Equation (19.16) is
multiplied by an attenuation factor, (1z0/H) for the MTLL where H is the channel height, or ez0/l for the
MTLE where l is the height constant. Details are found in Rakov and Uman (1998).
The Diendorfer–Uman (DU) Model and a Modiﬁcation of It
In the DU model (Diendorfer and Uman, 1990), the channel current above ground is assumed to discharge the
leader by way of two independent processes: (1) the discharge of the highly ionized core of the leader channel,
termed as the breakdown discharge process, with a time constant of 1 msec or less, and (2) the discharge of the

corona envelope with a larger time constant. In both cases, the discharge at a height z0 starts when the return
stroke front, assumed to travel up at a constant speed v, arrives at z0. The liberated currents are assumed to
ﬂow to the ground at the speed of light.
For a single current component at ground i(0,t), Diendorfer and Uman (1990) show that the current as a
function of height and time is
iðz0; tÞ ¼ ið0; tmÞ  ið0; z0=vÞ expðte=tÞ
ð19:17Þ
where tm ¼ ðt þ z0=vÞ, te ¼ ðt  z0=vÞ, v ¼ vð1 þ v=cÞ, and t is the discharge time constant.
An analytical
generalization of the DU model which allows for the return stroke speed and the downward current speed to
be arbitrary functions of height has been presented by Thottappillil et al. (1991).
Lightning–Overhead Wire Interactions
General
Lightning interactions with overhead wires such as power distribution lines are a major source of
electromagnetic compatibility problems, resulting in inferior power quality, power outages, and damaged
electronics. Only a small fraction of all the cloud-to-ground lightning ﬂashes directly strikes overhead lines,
making induced overvoltages a signiﬁcant source of power disturbances. This section begins with a discussion
of the appropriate transmission line ﬁgures. Then, examples of measured lightning-induced voltages on
overhead lines as well as calculated voltages are presented.
Transmission-Line Equations
To estimate voltages induced on distribution lines by nearby strikes, three basic coupling models have been
used: the model of Rusck (1958, 1977), the model of Chowdhuri and Gross (1967), and the model of Agrawal
et al. (1980). All of these models are based on transmission-line theory. The model of Agrawal et al. (1980) and
its equivalent formulations (Taylor et al., 1965; Rachidi, 1993; Nucci and Rachidi, 1995) can be considered to
be accurate within the limits of the transmission-line theory (Nucci and Rachidi, 1995), but in both the Rusck
and the Chowdhuri–Gross models, some source terms have been omitted (Nucci et al., 1995a,b; Cooray, 1994;
Cooray and Scuka, 1998). However, for the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld radiated from a vertical lightning
channel, the Rusck model is equivalent to the model of Agrawal et al. (Cooray, 1994). Besides his detailed
model, Rusck also proposed a simpliﬁed analytical formula for the peak-induced voltage on an inﬁnitely long
overhead line above a perfectly conducting ground as a function of the return-stroke peak current. A
discussion of the validity of the transmission-line theory vs. the more sophisticated scattering theory is found
in Tesche (1992).
The derivation of the time-domain coupling equations is conceptually simple. Maxwell’s equations are ﬁrst
integrated over closed cylindrical surfaces and along closed rectangular paths. The resulting integral equations,
which are in terms of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, are then recast in terms of voltages and currents. One
version of the transmission-line equations, due to Agrawal et al. (1980), follows:

where the superscript s identiﬁes the ‘‘scattered’’ quantities, the superscript i identiﬁes the ‘‘incident’’ quantities,
the superscript t identiﬁes the total measurable quantities, and the asterisk is the convolution operator.
In these equations, the only source along the horizontal portion of the line is the horizontal component of
the incident electric ﬁeld. At the line terminations, the boundary condition and the termination current, I, are
used to determine the end voltage. At those vertically oriented terminations, the vertical electric ﬁelds drive
currents through the terminations into the line. The total voltage, V t(x, t), at the line terminations must equal
IT*ZT at all times, where ZT is the termination impedance. Equation (19.18) to Equation (19.20) can be
represented by the circuit model in Figure 19.22.
Two basic assumptions are used to arrive at Equation (19.18) to Equation (19.20): (1) The response of the
power line (scattered voltages and currents) to the impinging EM wave (incident ﬁeld) is quasi TEM (i.e., the
scattered ﬁelds can be approximated as transverse electromagnetic). This allows us to deﬁne a ‘‘static’’ voltage
along the line and to relate the line current and the scattered magnetic ﬂux by an inductance, as well as the line
scattered voltage and charge by a capacitance. (2) The transverse dimensions of the line system are small
compared to the minimum wavelength, lmin, of the excitation wave, and the height of the line is much larger
than the diameter of the wire.
Measured and Calculated Lightning-Induced Voltages on Overhead Wires
Coupling models have been tested by means of natural lightning (Yokoyama et al., 1983; Master et al., 1984;
Eriksson, 1987; De la Rosa et al., 1988) and triggered lightning (Rubinstein et al., 1989; Georgiadis et al., 1992;
Barker et al., 1996). Laboratory tests have also been performed in a more controlled environment using NEMP
(nuclear electromagnetic pulse) simulators (e.g., Gerrieri et al., 1995) and also using reduced scale models
(e.g., Ishii et al., 1994, 1999; Piantini and Janiszewski, 1992; Nucci et al., 1998). Nucci (1995) presented a
survey of some of these tests.
Calculations of the voltages induced on overhead lines under various conditions have been given, for
example, by Master and Uman (1984), Diendorfer (1990), Chowdhuri (1989a,b, 1990), Georgiadis et al.
(1992), Nucci et al. (1993a,b), Ishii et al. (1994), Rachidi et al. (1997a,b), Michishita et al. (1996, 1997),
Rachidi et al. (1999), and Paolone et al. (2004).
The strategy in the various experiments designed to test a coupling model is similar. Measure the lightning
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the vicinity of an instrumented overhead line (or compute them from a return
stroke model) while simultaneously measuring the voltages induced on the line, the ﬁelds then being used as
inputs to a computer program written to solve Equation (19.18) to Equation (19.20) and the computer-
calculated voltage waveforms being compared with the measured voltage waveforms. The following discussion
illustrates the types of voltage waveforms induced on overhead wires by lightning beyond a few kilometers and
the degree of agreement that has been obtained in the coupling-model calculations. Examples of voltages

induced on a 450 m overhead line about 10 m above the ground are shown in Figure 19.23. Each line end was
either terminated in its characteristic impedance or open-circuited (four different cases), and voltages were
measured simultaneously at each end. Figure 19.24 and Figure 19.25 contain speciﬁc examples of measured
and calculated voltage waveforms at each line end as well as the measured vertical electric ﬁeld and calculated
horizontal electric ﬁeld via Equation (19.7). It is clear from Figure 19.23 to Figure 19.25 that the induced
voltage polarities and waveshapes are strongly dependent on the angle to the lightning and on the line end
terminations. It is apparent also from Georgiadis et al. (1992) that while the measured and calculated voltage
waveshapes are in good agreement, the measured voltage amplitudes are, on average, a factor of three smaller
than calculated voltages. This amplitude discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the ﬁelds reaching the
power line were shielded by trees along the line whereas the ﬁelds measured were in an open area and hence
were unshielded.
Barker et al. (1996) measured voltages on a 10 m high test distribution line when lightning was triggered
(artiﬁcially initiated) using the rocket-and-wire technique at a distance of 145 m from the line. Stroke current,

resolution. For 63 strokes having peak currents between a few kA and 44 kA, peak-induced voltages at the
center of the line relative to a grounded wire about 2 m below ranged between 8 and 100 kV, the peak values
being linearly correlated with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.75. The waveshapes of the induced voltage were
unipolar with a median width at half-peak value of about 4 msec, whereas the typical width of the current was
nearly an order of magnitude larger. According to Barker et al. (1996), the induced voltage waveform
resembles the derivative of the vertical electric ﬁeld, the theory of Agrawal et al. (1980) and other equivalent
approaches accounting well for the observations. The peak induced voltages were roughly 60% larger than
predicted by the simpliﬁed formula of Rusck (1958, 1977) discussed above.

being caused by variation in the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬂux density components due to nearby conductors as
determined from comparing azimuths computed from the Bs and from a commercial lightning location system (LLP).

ﬁeld of the surrounding air. At that time one or more upward-going discharges are initiated. After
traveling a few tens of meters, one of the upward discharges, which is essentially at ground potential,
contacts the tip of one branch of the stepped leader, which is at a high potential, completing the leader
path to ground.
Dart leader:
A continuously moving leader lowering charge preceding a return stroke subsequent to the
ﬁrst. A dart leader typically propagates down the residual channel of the previous stroke.
Flash:
A complete lightning discharge of any type.
Preliminary breakdown:
An electrical discharge in the cloud that initiates a cloud-to-ground ﬂash.
Return stroke:
The upward propagating high-current, bright, potential discontinuity following the leader
that discharges to the ground some or all of the charge previouslydeposited along the channel by the leader.

Overview of Pulsed Radars
Basic Concept of Pulse Radar Operation
The basic operation of a pulse radar is depicted in Figure 20.1. The radar transmits pulses superimposed on a
radio frequency (RF) carrier and then receives returns (reﬂections) from desired and undesired scatterers.
Scatterers corresponding to desired targets may include space, airborne, and sea- or surface-based vehicles.
They can also include the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere in remote sensing applications. Returns from
undesired scatterers are denoted as clutter. Clutter sources include the Earth’s surface, natural and man-made
discrete objects, the sea, and volumetric atmospheric phenomena such as rain and birds. Short-range/low-
altitude radar operation is often constrained by clutter since a multitude of undesired returns masks returns
from targets of interest such as aircraft. Conversely, volumetric atmospheric phenomena may be considered as
targets for weather radar systems. The magnitude of the clutter returns exceeds those from small targets by
multiple orders of magnitudes so a combination of angle, range, and Doppler ﬁltering is required to extract
returns from targets of interest.
The range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and range rate can be directly measured from a return to estimate
target metrics, position, and velocity to support tracking. Signature data to support noncooperative target
identiﬁcation or environmental remote sensing can be extracted by measuring the amplitude, phase, and
polarization of the return.
Pulse radar affords a great deal of design and operational ﬂexibility. Pulse duration, pulse rate, and
pulse bandwidth can be tailored to speciﬁc applications to provide optimal performance. Modern
computer-controlled multiple-function radars exploit this capability by choosing the best waveform from a
repertoire for a given operational mode and interference environment automatically. Pulsed operation also
20-1

enables the extreme ratio between transmitter power
and
receiver
sensitivity,
exceeding
1020
in
some
systems, necessitated by the detection of small targets
at long ranges.
Radar Applications
The breadth of pulse radar applications is summarized in
Table 20.1 in terms of operating frequencies. Radar
applications can also be grouped into search, track, and
signature measurement applications. Search radars are
used for surveillance tracking but have relatively coarse
metric accuracy. The search functions favor broad
beamwidths and low bandwidths in order to efﬁciently search over a large spatial volume. As indicated in
Table 20.1, search is preferably performed in the lower frequency bands. The antenna pattern is typically narrow
in azimuth and has a cosecant pattern in elevation to provide acceptable coverage from the horizon to the zenith.
Tracking radars are typically characterized by a narrow beamwidth and moderate bandwidth in order to
provide accurate range and angle measurements on a given target. The antenna pattern is typically
characterized as a pencil beam with approximately the same dimensions in azimuth and elevation. Track is
usually conducted at the higher frequency bands in order to minimize the beamwidth for a given antenna
aperture area as well as provide enhanced range and Doppler resolution. After each return from a target is
received, the range and angle are measured and input into a track ﬁlter. Track ﬁltering smoothes the data to
reﬁne the estimate of target position and velocity. It also predicts the target’s ﬂight path to provide range
gating and antenna pointing control to the radar system.
Signature measurement applications include remote sensing of the environment as well as the measurement
of target characteristics. In some applications, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is conducted from
aircraft or satellites to characterize land usage over broad areas. Moving targets that present changing aspects
to the radar can be imaged from airborne or ground-based radars via inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)

techniques. As deﬁned in the subsection ‘‘Resolution and Accuracy,’’ cross-range resolution improves with
increasing antenna extent. SAR/ISAR effectively substitutes an extended observation interval over which
coherent returns are collected from different target aspect angles for a large antenna structure that would not
be physically realizable in many instances.
In general, characterization performance improves with increasing frequency because of the associated
improvement in range, range rate, and cross-range resolution. However, phenomenological characterization to
support environmental remote sensing may require data collected across a broad swath of frequencies. For a
given sensitivity, as deﬁned by the product of transmit power, antenna gain, and receive antenna aperture area
divided by the product of system noise temperature and composite loss factor, the cost of a radar system
generally increases with carrier frequency.
A multiple-function phased array radar generally integrates these functions to some degree. Its design is
typically driven by the necessity to maintain a given surveillance rate while supporting precision track of a
speciﬁed set of targets. Its operational frequency is generally a compromise between the lower frequency of the
search radar and the higher frequency desired for the tracking radar. The degree of signature measurement
implemented to support such functions as noncooperative target identiﬁcation depends on the resolution
capability of the radar as well as the operational user requirements. Multiple-function radar design represents
a compromise among these different requirements. However, implementation constraints, multiple-target
handling requirements, and reaction time requirements often dictate the use of phased array radar systems
integrating search, track, and characterization functions.
Critical Subsystem Design and Technology
The major subsystems making up a pulse radar system are depicted in Figure 20.2. The associated interaction
between function and technology is summarized in this subsection.
Antenna
The radar antenna provides spatial directivity to the transmitted EM wave and intercepts the scattering of that
wave from a target while attenuating interference signals from undesired angles of arrival. Most radar antennas
may be categorized as mechanically scanning or electronically scanning. Mechanically scanned reﬂector
antennas are used in applications where rapid beam scanning is not required. Electronic scanning antennas
include phased arrays and frequency scanned antennas. Phased array beams can be steered to any point in
their ﬁeld-of-view, typically within 10 to 100 msec, depending on the latency of the beam steering subsystem
and the switching time of the phase shifters. Phased arrays are desirable in multiple function radars since they
can interleave search operations with multiple target tracks.
FIGURE 20.2
Radar system architecture.

Radar

There is a Fourier transform relationship between the antenna illumination function and the far-ﬁeld
antenna pattern analogous to spectral analysis. Hence, tapering the illumination to concentrate power near the
center of the antenna suppresses spatial sidelobes while reducing the effective antenna aperture area. The phase
and amplitude control of the antenna illumination determine the achievable sidelobe suppression and angle
measurement accuracy.
Perturbations in the illumination due to the mechanical and electrical sources distort the illumination
function and constrain performance in these areas. Mechanical illumination error sources include antenna
shape deformation due to sag and thermal effects as well as manufacturing defects. Electrical illumination
error is of particular concern in phased arrays where sources include beam steering computational error
and phase shifter quantization. Control of both the mechanical and electrical perturbation errors is the
key to both low sidelobes and highly accurate angle measurements. Control denotes that either tolerance
is closely held and maintained or that there must be some means for monitoring and correction. Phased
arrays are attractive for low sidelobe applications since they can provide element-level phase and
amplitude control.
Transmitter
The transmitter function is to amplify waveforms to a power level sufﬁcient for target detection and
estimation. There is a general trend away from tube-based transmitters toward solid-state transmitters. In
particular, solid-state transmit/receive modules appear attractive for constructing phased array radar systems.
In this case, each radiating element is driven by a module that contains a solid-state transmitter, phase shifter,
low-noise ampliﬁer, and associated control components. Active electronically scanned arrays built from such
modules appear to offer signiﬁcant reliability advantages over radar systems driven from a single transmitter.
In addition to the redundancy inherent in a distributed transmitter, the solid-state components and
supporting low-voltage power supplies are more reliable than tubes or their attendant high-voltage power
supplies. In general, solid-state transmitters offer less peak power than tube-based transmitters but can provide
equivalent radar performance by operating at higher transmit duty cycles and enabling reduced RF losses.
There is a strong trend in developmental radars toward the use of solid-state transmitters due to production
base economics as well as performance considerations. Table 20.2 summarizes transmitter technologies.
Receiver and Exciter
This subsystem contains the precision timing and frequency reference source or sources used to derive the
master oscillator and local oscillator reference frequencies. These reference frequencies are used to down
convert received signals in a multiple-stage superheterodyne architecture to accommodate signal ampliﬁcation
and interference rejection. Filtering is conducted at the carrier and intermediate frequencies in processing to
reject interference outside the operating band of the radar. The receiver front end is typically protected from
overload during transmission through the combination of a circulator and a transmit/receive switch.
The exciter generates the waveforms for subsequent transmission. As in signal processing, the trend is
toward programmable digital signal synthesis because of the associated ﬂexibility and performance stability.
Rejection of strong clutter via Doppler ﬁltering in order to detect small low-altitude targets also demands very
stable frequency reference sources as spurious sidebands of the clutter can mask the target returns.
Signal and Data Processing
Digital processing is generally divided between two processing subsystems, i.e., signals and data, according to
the algorithm structure, and throughput demands. Signal processing includes pulse compression, Doppler
ﬁltering, and detection threshold estimation and testing. Data processing includes track ﬁltering, user interface
support, and such specialized functions as electronic protection and built-in test (BIT), as well as the resource
management process required to control the radar system.
The signal processor is often optimized to perform the repetitive complex multiply-and-add operations
associated with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). FFT processing is used for implementing pulse compression
via fast convolution and for Doppler ﬁltering. Pulse compression consists of matched ﬁltering on receive to an
intrapulse modulation imposed on the transmitted pulse. As delineated subsequently, the imposed intrapulse
20-4
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

bandwidth determines the range resolution of the pulse while the modulation format determines the
suppression of the waveform matched-ﬁlter response outside the nominal range resolution extent. Fast
convolution consists of taking the FFT of the digitized receiver output, multiplying it by the stored FFT of the
desired ﬁlter function and then taking the inverse FFT of the resulting product. Fast convolution results in
signiﬁcant computational saving over performing the time-domain convolution of returns with the ﬁlter
function corresponding to the matched ﬁlter. Similarly, Doppler ﬁltering can be conducted by performing an
N-point FFT across the equivalent range-sampling point of N successive pulses presupposing coherent
transmission and reception. The signal processor output can be characterized in terms of range gates and
Doppler ﬁlters corresponding approximately to the range and Doppler resolution, respectively.
In contrast, the radar data processor typically consists of a general-purpose computer with an operating
system and application software suite supporting real-time operation. Fielded radar data processors range
from microcomputers to mainframe computers, depending on the requirements of the radar system. The
heterogonous algorithmic mixture of radar signal/data processing typically results in signiﬁcant processing
inefﬁciency so benchmarking is essential. The timing and control subsystem typically functions as the two-way
interface between the data processor and the other radar subsystems. The increasing inclusion of BIT and
built-in calibration capability in timing and control subsystem designs promises to result in signiﬁcant
improvement in ﬁelded system performance and availability. The trend is toward increasing use of commercial
off-the-shelf digital processing elements and software development/maintenance tools for radar applications
and tighter integration of the signal and data processing functions. Radar signal/data processing is anticipated
to beneﬁt from increased usage of open system architectures.
Radar Performance Prediction
Radar Line-of-Sight
With the exception of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, which exploit either sky-wave bounce or
ground-wave propagation modes and sporadic ducting effects at higher frequencies, surface and airborne
platform radar operation is limited to the refraction-constrained line of sight. Atmospheric refraction
effects can be closely approximated by setting the Earth’s radius to 4/3 its nominal value in estimating

horizon-limited range. The resulting line-of-sight range is depicted in Figure 20.3 for a surface-based radar
and a notional 10-km altitude airborne radar.
As evident in the plot, airborne surveillance radar systems offer signiﬁcant advantages in the detection of
low-altitude targets that would otherwise be masked by Earth’s curvature and terrain features from
surface-based radars. However, efﬁcient clutter rejection techniques must be used in order to detect targets
since surface clutter returns will be present at almost all ranges of interest.
Radar Range Equation
The radar range equation is commonly used to estimate radar system performance, given that line-of-sight
conditions are satisﬁed. This formulation essentially computes the signal-to-noise ratio ðS=NÞ at the output of
the radar signal processor. In turn, S=N is used to provide estimates of radar detection and position
measurement performance as described in subsequent subsections. S=N can be calculated in terms of the
number of pulses coherently integrated over a single coherent processing interval (CPI) using the radar range
equation such that:
S=N ¼
PGATpNps
ð4pÞ2R4LtLrnLspkTs
ð20:1Þ
where P is peak transmitter power output, G is directivity of the transmit antenna, A is effective aperture area
of the receive antenna in meters squared, Tp is pulse duration, s is radar cross-section in square meters, Np is
the number of coherently integrated pulses within the coherent processing interval, R is range to target in
meters, Lt is system ohmic and nonohmic transmit losses, Lm is system nonohmic receive losses, Lsp is signal
processing losses, k is Boltzman’s constant ð1:38 · 1023KÞ; and Ts is system noise temperature, including
receive ohmic losses (Kelvin). S/N losses are derived relative to matched ﬁlter performance.
At X band and above it is prudent to include propagation loss due to atmospheric absorption (Blake, 1986).
This form of the radar range equation is applicable to radar systems using pulse compression or pulse Doppler
waveforms as well as the unmodulated single-pulse case. In many applications, average power is a better
measure of system performance than peak power since it indicates the S=N improvement achievable with

pulse integration over a given interval of time. Hence, the radar range equation can be modiﬁed such that:
S=N ¼
PaGATcs
ð4pÞ2R4LtLrnLspkTs
ð20:2Þ
where Pa is average transmitter power and Tc is the coherent processing interval (CPI).
The portion of time over which the transmitter is in operation is referred to as the radar duty cycle. The
average transmitter power is the product of duty cycle and peak transmitter power. Duty cycle ranges from
less than 1% for typical noncoherent pulse radars to somewhat less than 50% for high pulse repetition
frequency (PRF) pulse Doppler or interrupted continuous wave radar systems. The CPI is the period over
which returns are collected for coherent processing functions such as pulse integration and Doppler ﬁltering.
The CPI can be estimated as the product of the number of coherently integrated pulses and the interval
between pulses. Noncoherent pulse integration is less efﬁcient and alters the statistical character of the signal
and interference.
Antenna Directivity and Aperture Area
The directivity of the antenna, G, is
G ¼ 4pAZ
l2
ð20:3Þ
where Z is aperture efﬁciency and l is radar carrier wavelength. Aperture inefﬁciency is due to the antenna
illumination factor.
The common form of the radar range equation uses power gain rather than directivity. Antenna gain is
equal to the directivity divided by the antenna losses. In the design and analysis of modern radars, directivity is
a more convenient measure of performance because it permits designs with distributed active elements, such
as solid-state phased arrays, to be assessed to permit direct comparison with passive antenna systems.
Beamwidth and directivity are inversely related, as beamwidth is proportion to the RF carrier wavelength
divided by antenna extent. A useful approximation summarizing these relationships is
G < 30,000
yazyel
ð20:4Þ
where yaz and yel are the radar azimuth and elevation beamwidths, respectively, in degrees.
Radar Cross-Section
In practice, the radar cross-section (RCS) of a realistic target must be considered a random variable with an
associated correlation interval. Targets are composed of multiple interacting scatters so that the composite
return varies in magnitude with the constructive and destructive interference of the contributing returns. The
target RCS is typically estimated as the mean or median of the target RCS distribution. The associated
correlation interval indicates the rate at which the target RCS varies over time. RCS ﬂuctuation degrades
single-look target detection performance at moderate to high probability of detection but is mitigated by a
search strategy that enables collecting several independent returns on any given target. The radar coherent
processing interval is generally chosen sufﬁciently short that the RCS does not signiﬁcantly change over that
period.
The median RCS of typical targets is given in Table 20.3. The composite RCS measured by a radar
system may be composed of multiple individual targets in the case of closely spaced targets such as a bird
ﬂock.

Loss and System Temperature Estimation
Sources of S/N loss include ohmic and nonohmic (mismatch) loss in the antenna and other radio frequency
components, propagation effects, signal processing deviations from matched ﬁlter operation, detection
thresholding, and search losses. Scan loss in phased array radars is due to the combined effects of the decrease
in projected antenna area and element mismatch with increasing scan angle.
Search operations impose additional losses due to target position uncertainty. Because the target
position is unknown before detection, the beam, range gate, and Doppler ﬁlter will not be centered on
the target return. Hence, straddling loss will occur as the target effectively straddles adjacent resolution
cells in range and Doppler. Beamshape loss is a consequence of the radar beam not being pointed directly
at the target so that there is a resultant loss in both transmit and receive antenna gain. Other
search losses include detection threshold loss associated with radar system adaptation to interference
(Nathanson, 1991).
System noise temperature estimation corresponds to assessing the system thermal noise ﬂoor referenced to
the antenna output. Assuming the receiver hardware is at ambient temperature, the system noise temperature
can be estimated as
Ts ¼ Ta þ 290ðLroF  1Þ
ð20:5Þ
where Ta is the antenna noise temperature, Lro is receive ohmic losses, and F is the receiver noise ﬁgure.
In phased array radars, the thermodynamic temperature of the antenna receive beamformer may be
signiﬁcantly higher than ambient, so a more complete analysis is required. The antenna noise temperature is
determined by the external noise received by the antenna from solar, atmospheric, Earth surface, and other
sources. In addition, active electronically scanned arrays often utilize several levels of active ampliﬁcation
within the beamformer so the analysis must consider the composite system noise temperature imposed by
spatial combining, ampliﬁer characteristics, and intervening losses.
Table 20.4 provides typical loss and noise temperature budgets for several major radar classes. In general, loss
increases with the complexity of the radar hardware between the transmitter/receiver and the antenna radiator.

Reﬂector antennas and active phased arrays impose relatively low loss, while passive array antennas impose
relatively high loss.
Resolution and Accuracy
The fundamental resolution capabilities of a radar system are summarized in Table 20.5. In general, there is a
trade-off between mainlobe resolution corresponding to the nominal range, Doppler, and angle resolution,
and effective dynamic range corresponding to suppression of sidelobe components. This is evident in the use
of weighting to suppress Doppler sidebands and angle sidelobes at the expense of broadening the mainlobe
and S/N loss.
Cross range denotes either of the two dimensions orthogonal to the radar line of sight. Cross-range resolution
in real-aperture antenna systems is closely approximated by the product of target range and radar beamwidth in
radians. Attainment of the nominal ISAR/SAR cross-range resolution generally requires complex signal
processing to generate a focused image, including correction for scatterer change in range over the CPI.
The best accuracy performance occurs for the case of thermal noise-limited error. The resulting accuracy is
the resolution of the radar divided by the square root of the S/N and an appropriate monopulse or
interpolation factor. In this formulation, the single-pulse S/N has been multiplied by the number of pulses
integrated within the CPI as indicated in Equation (20.1) and Equation (20.2).

Radar

In practice, accuracy is also constrained by environmental effects, target characteristics, and instrumentation
error as well as the available S/N. Environmental effects include multipath and refraction. Target glint is
characterized by an apparent wandering of the target position because of coherent interference effects
associated with the composite return from the individual scattering centers on the target. Instrumentation
error is minimized with alignment and calibration but may signiﬁcantly constrain track ﬁlter performance as a
result of the relatively long correlation interval of some error sources.
Radar Range Equation for Search and Track
The radar range equation can be modiﬁed to directly address performance in the two primary radar missions:
search and track.
Search performance is basically determined by the capability of the radar system to detect a target of speciﬁc
RCS at a given maximum detection range while scanning a given solid angle extent within a speciﬁed period of
time. S=N can be set equal to the minimum value required for a given detection performance, S=Njr; while R
can be set to the maximum required target detection range, Rmax. Manipulation of the radar range equation
results in the following expression:
PaA

sTfs
· 16
ð20:6Þ
where O is the solid angle over which search must be performed (steradians), Tfs is the time allowed to search
O by operational requirements, and Los is the composite incremental loss associated with search.
The left-hand side of the equation contains radar design parameters, while the right-hand side is
determined by target characteristics and operational requirements. The right-hand side of the equation is
evaluated to determine radar requirements. The left-hand side of the equation is evaluated to determine if the
radar design meets the requirements.
The track radar range equation is conditioned on noise-limited angle accuracy as this measure stresses radar
capabilities signiﬁcantly more than range accuracy in almost all cases of interest. The operational requirement is
to maintain a givendata rate track providing a speciﬁed single-measurement angle accuracy for a given numberof
targets with speciﬁed RCS and range. Antenna beamwidth, which is proportional to the radar carrier wavelength
divided by antenna extent, impacts track performance since the degree of S=N required for a given measurement
accuracy decreases as the beamwidth decreases. Track performance requirements can be bounded as

where r is the single-target track rate, Nt is the number of targets under track in different beams, sy is the
required angle accuracy standard deviation (radians), and s is the RCS. In general, a phased array radar
antenna is required to support multiple target tracking when Nt > 1:
Incremental search losses are suppressed during single-target-per-beam tracking. The beam is pointed as
closely as possible to the target to suppress beamshape loss. The tracking loop centers the range gate and
Doppler ﬁlter on the return. Detection thresholding loss can be minimal since the track range window is small,
although the presence of multiple targets generally mandates continual detection processing.
Radar Waveforms
Pulse Compression
Typical pulse radar waveforms are summarized in Table 20.6. In most cases, the signal processor is designed to
closely approximate a matched ﬁlter. As indicated in Table 20.5, the range and Doppler resolution of any
match-ﬁltered waveform are inversely proportional to the waveform bandwidth and duration, respectively.
Pulse compression, using modulated waveforms, is attractive since S/N is proportional to pulse duration
rather than bandwidth in matched ﬁlter implementations. Ideally, the intrapulse modulation is chosen to
20-10
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

attain adequate range resolution and range sidelobe suppression performance while the pulse duration is
chosen to provide the required sensitivity. Pulse compression waveforms are characterized as having a time
bandwidth product (TBP) signiﬁcantly greater than unity, in contrast to an unmodulated pulse, which has a
TBP of approximately unity.
Pulse Repetition Frequency
The radar system pulse repetition frequency (PRF) determines its ability to unambiguously measure target
range and range rate in a single CPI as well as determining the inherent clutter rejection capabilities of the
radar system. In order to obtain an unambiguous measurement of target range, the interval between radar
pulses ð1=PRFÞ must be greater than the time required for a single pulse to propagate to a target at a given
range and back. The maximum unambiguous range is then given by C=ð2=PRFÞ where C is the velocity of
electromagnetic propagation.
Returns from moving targets and clutter sources are offset from the radar carrier frequency by the associated
Doppler frequency. As a function of range rate, Vr, the Doppler frequency, fD; is given by fD ¼ 2 · Vr=l:
A coherent pulse train samples the returns Doppler modulation at the PRF. Most radar systems employ
parallel sampling in the in-phase and quadrature baseband channels so that the effective sampling rate is twice
the PRF. The targets return is folded in frequency if the PRF is less than the target Doppler.
Clutter returns are primarily from stationary or near-stationary surfaces such as terrain. In contrast, targets
of interest often have a signiﬁcant range rate relative to the radar clutter. Doppler ﬁltering can suppress returns
from clutter. With the exception of frequency ambiguity, the Doppler ﬁltering techniques used to implement
pulse Doppler ﬁltering are quite similar to those described for CW radar in Section 20.2. Ambiguous
measurements can be resolved over multiple CPIs by using a sequence of slightly different PRFs and correlating
detections among the CPIs.
Detection and Search
Detection processing consists of comparing the amplitude of each range gate/Doppler ﬁlter output with a
threshold. A detection is reported if the amplitude exceeds that threshold. A false alarm occurs when noise or
other interference produces an output of sufﬁcient magnitude to exceed the detection threshold. As the
detection threshold is decreased, the detection probability and the false alarm probability increase. S=N must
be increased to enhance detection probability while maintaining a constant false alarm probability.
As noted in the subsection Radar Cross-Section, RCS ﬂuctuation effects must be considered in assessing
detection performance. The Swerling models which use chi-squared probability density functions (PDFs) of
two and four degrees of freedom (DOF) are commonly used for this purpose. The Swerling 1 and 2 models are

based on the two DOF PDF and can be derived by modeling the target as an ensemble of independent
scatterers of comparable magnitude. This model is considered representative of complex targets such as
aircraft. The Swerling 3 and 4 models use the four DOF PDF and correspond to a target with a single
dominant scatterer and an ensemble of lesser scatterers. Missiles are sometimes represented by Swerling 2 and
4 models. The Swerling 1 and 3 models presuppose slow ﬂuctuation such that the target RCS is constant from
pulse to pulse within a scan. In contrast, the RCS of Swerling 2 and 4 targets is modeled as independent on a
pulse to pulse basis.
Single-pulse detection probabilities for nonﬂuctuating, Swerling 1/2, and Swerling 3/4 targets are depicted
in Figure 20.4. This curve is based on a typical false alarm number corresponding approximately to a false
alarm probability of 106. The difference in S=N required for a given detection probability for a ﬂuctuating
target relative to the nonﬂuctuating case is termed as the ﬂuctuation loss.
The detection curves presented here and in most other references presuppose noise-limited operation. In
many cases, the composite interference present at the radar system output will be dominated by clutter returns
or electromagnetic interference such as that imposed by hostile electronic countermeasures. The standard

textbook detection curves cannot be applied in these situations unless the composite interference is statistically
similar to thermal noise with a Gaussian PDF and a white power spectral density. The presence of
non-Gaussian interference is generally characterized by an elevated false alarm probability, as the PDF tails are
relatively greater. Adaptive detection threshold estimation techniques are often required to search for targets in
environments characterized by such interference (Nathanson, 1991).
Estimation and Tracking
Measurement Error Sources
Radars measure target range and angle position, and potentially, Doppler frequency. Angle measurement
performance is emphasized here since the corresponding cross-range error dominates range error for most
practical applications. Target returns are generally smoothed in a tracking ﬁlter, but tracking performance is
ultimately determined by the measurement accuracy and associated error characteristics of the subject radar
system. Radar measurement error can be characterized as indicated in Table 20.7.
The radar design and the alignment and calibration process development must consider the characteristics
and interaction of these error components. Integration of automated techniques to support alignment and
calibration is an area of strong effort in modern radar design that can lead to signiﬁcant performance
improvement in ﬁelded systems.
As indicated previously, angle measurement generally is the limiting factor in measurement accuracy. Target
azimuth and elevation position is primarily measured by a monopulse technique in modern radars though
early systems used sequential lobing and conical scanning. Specialized monopulse tracking radars utilizing
reﬂectors have achieved instrumentation and S=N angle residual systematic error as low as 50 mrad. Phased
array antennas have achieved a random error of less than 60 mrad, but the composite systematic residual errors
remain to be measured. The limitations are primarily in the tolerance on the phase and amplitude of the
antenna illumination function.
Figure 20.5 shows the monopulse beam patterns. The ﬁrst is the received sum pattern that is generated by a
feed that provides the energy from the reﬂector or phased array antenna through two ports in equal amounts
and summed in phase in a monopulse comparator shown in Figure 20.6. The second is the difference pattern
generated by providing the energy through the same two ports in equal amounts but taken out with a phase
difference of p radians, giving a null at the center. A target located at the center of the same beam would receive
a strong signal from the sum pattern with which the target could be detected and ranged. The received
difference pattern would produce a null return, indicating the target was at the center of the beam. If the target
were off the null, the signal output or difference voltage would be almost linear and proportional to the
distance off the center (off-axis), as shown in the ﬁgure. This output of the monopulse processor is the real
part of the dot product of the complex sums and the difference signals divided by the absolute magnitude of
the sum signal squared, i.e.:

The random instrumentation measurement errors in

of

function.
In
reﬂector systems, such errors occur because of the
position of the feedhorn, differences in electrical
length between the feed and the monopulse compara-
tor, mechanical precision of the reﬂector, and its
mechanical rotation. In phased array radars, these
errors are a function of the phase shifters, time-delay
units, and combiners between the antenna elements and the monopulse comparator as well as the precision
of the array. Although these errors are random, they may have correlation intervals considerably longer than
the white noise considered in the thermal-noise random error and may depend upon the ﬂight path of the
target. For a target headed radially from or toward the radar, the correlation period of angle-measurement
instrumental errors is essentially the tracking period. For crossing targets, the correlation interval may be
pulse to pulse.
As in the estimate of range, the propagation effects of refraction and multipath also enter into the tracking
error. The bias error in range and elevation angle by refraction can be estimated as
DR ¼ 0:007 Nscosecant E0
ðmÞ
ð20:9Þ
DE0 ¼ Ns cot E0
ðmradÞ
where Ns is the surface refractivity and E0 is the elevation angle (Barton and Ward, 1984).
One can calculate the average error in multipath. However, one cannot correct for it as in refraction since
the direction of the error cannot be known in advance unless there are controlled conditions such as in a
carefully controlled experiment. Hence, the general approach is to design the antenna sidelobes to be as low as
feasible and accept the multipath error that occurs when tracking close to the horizon. There has been
considerable research to ﬁnd means to reduce the impact, including using very wide bandwidths to separate
the direct path from the multipath return as well as specialized track ﬁltering techniques that accommodate
multipath effects.

Tracking Filter Performance
Target tracking based on processing returns from multiple CPIs generally provides a target position and
velocity estimate of greater accuracy than the single-CPI measurement accuracy delineated in Table 20.5. In
principle, the error variance of the estimated target position with the target moving at a constant velocity is
approximately 4=n · s2
m; where n is the number of independent measurements processed by the track ﬁlter and
sm is the single measurement accuracy. In practice, the variance reduction factor afforded by a track ﬁlter is
often limited to about one order of magnitude because of the reasons summarized in the following
paragraphs.
Track ﬁltering generally provides smoothing and prediction of target position and velocity via a recursive
prediction–correction process. The ﬁlter predicts the targets position at the time of the next measurement
based on the current smoothed estimates of position, velocity, and possibly acceleration. The subsequent
difference between the measured position at this time and the predicted position is used to update the
smoothed estimates. The update process incorporates a weighting vector that determines the relative
signiﬁcance given the track ﬁlter prediction versus the new measurement in updating the smoothed
estimate.
Target model ﬁdelity and adaptivity are fundamental issues in track ﬁlter mechanization. Independent one-
dimensional tracking loops may be implemented to control pulse-to-pulse range gate positioning and antenna
pointing. The performance of one-dimensional polynomial algorithms, such as the alpha-beta ﬁlter, to track
targets from one pulse to the next and provide modest smoothing is generally adequate to maintain track.
However, one-dimensional closed-loop tracking ignores knowledge of the equations of motion governing the
target so that their smoothing and long-term prediction performance is relatively poor for targets with known
equations of motion. In addition, simple one-dimensional tracking-loop ﬁlters do not incorporate any
adaptivity or measure of estimation quality.
Kalman ﬁltering addresses these shortcomings at the cost of signiﬁcantly greater computational complexity
and potentially increased maneuver response latency. Target equations of motion are modeled explicitly such
that the position, velocity, and potentially higher-order derivatives of each measurement dimension are
estimated by the track ﬁlter as a state vector. The error associated with the estimated state vector is modeled
via a covariance matrix that is also updated with each iteration of the track ﬁlter. The covariance matrix
determines the weight vector used to update the smoothed state vector in order to incorporate such factors as
measurement S/N and dynamic target maneuvering.
Smoothing performance is constrained by the degree of a priori knowledge of the target’s kinematic motion
characteristics. For example, Kalman ﬁltering can achieve signiﬁcantly better error reduction against ballistic
or orbital targets than against maneuvering aircraft. In the former case, the equations of motion are explicitly
known, while the latter case imposes motion model error because of the presence of unpredictable pilot or
guidance system commands. Similar considerations apply to the ﬁdelity of the track ﬁlters model of radar
measurement error. Failure to consider the impact of correlated measurement errors may result in
underestimating track error when designing the system. A number of innovative track ﬁltering techniques
have been formulated to address these issues.
Many modern tracking problems are driven by the presence of multiple targets that impose a need for
assigning measurements to speciﬁc tracks as well as accommodating unresolved returns from closely spaced
targets. Existing radars generally employ some variant of the nearest-neighbor algorithm where a measurement
is uniquely assigned to the track with a predicted position minimizing the normalized track ﬁlter update error.
More sophisticated techniques assign measurements to multiple tracks if they cannot clearly be resolved or
make the assignment on the basis of several contiguous update measurements.

Continuous Wave Radar
Samuel O. Piper and James C. Wiltse
Continuous wave (CW) radar employs a transmitter which is on all or most of the time. Unmodulated CW
radar is very simple and is able to detect the Doppler-frequency shift in the return signal from a target
which has a component of motion toward or away from the transmitter. While such a radar cannot
measure range, it is used widely in applications such as police radars, motion detectors, burglar alarms,
proximity fuzes for projectiles or missiles, illuminators for semiactive missile guidance systems (such as the
Hawk surface-to-air missile), and scatterometers (used to measure the scattering properties of targets or
clutter such as terrain surfaces) (Saunders, 1990; Ulaby and Elachi, 1990; Nathanson, 1991; Komarov, 2003;
Pace, 2003).
Modulated versions include frequency-modulated (FMCW), interrupted frequency-modulated (IFMCW),
and phase-modulated. Typical waveforms are indicated in Figure 20.7. Such systems are used in altimeters,
Doppler navigators, proximity fuzes, over-the-horizon radar, and active seekers for terminal guidance of air-
to-surface missiles. The term continuous is often used to indicate a relatively long waveform (as contrasted to
pulse radar using short pulses) or a radar with a high duty cycle (for instance, 50% or greater, as contrasted
with the typical duty cycle of less than 10% for the usual pulse radar). As an example of a long waveform,
planetary radars may transmit for up to 10 h and are thus considered to be CW (Freiley et al., 1992).
Another example is interrupted CW (or pulse-Doppler) radar, where the transmitter is pulsed at a high rate
for 10 to 60% of the total time (Nathanson, 1991). All of these modulated CW radars are able to measure
range.
The ﬁrst portion of this section discusses concepts, principles of operation, and limitations. The latter
portion describes various applications. In general, CW radars have several potential advantages over pulse
radars. Advantages include simplicity and the facts that the transmitter leakage is used as the local oscillator,

transmitter spectral spread is minimal (not true for wide-deviation FMCW), and peak power is the same as
(or only a little greater than) the average power. This latter situation means that the radar is less detectable by
simple intercepting equipment.
The largest disadvantage for CW radars is the need to provide antenna isolation (reduce spillover) so that
the transmitted signal does not interfere with the receiver. In a pulse radar, the transmitter is off before the
receiver is enabled (by means of a duplexer and/or receiver-protector switch). Isolation is frequently obtained
in the CW case by employing two antennas, one for transmit and one for reception. When this is done, there is
also a reduction of close-in clutter return from rain or terrain. A second disadvantage is the existence of noise
sidebands on the transmitter signal which reduce sensitivity because the Doppler frequencies are relatively
close to the carrier. This is considered in more detail below.
CW Doppler Radar
If a sine wave signal is transmitted, the return from a moving target would be Doppler-shifted in frequency by
an amount given by the following equation:
fD ¼ 2vrfT
c
¼ Doppler frequency
ð20:10Þ
where fT ¼ transmitted frequency; c ¼ velocity of propagation, 3 · 108 m/sec; and vr ¼ radial component of
velocity between radar and target.

Radar

Using Equation (20.10) the Doppler frequencies have been calculated for several speeds and are given in
Table 20.8.
As may be seen, the Doppler frequencies at 10 GHz (X band) range from 30 Hz to about 18 kHz for a speed
range between 1 and 600 mph. The spectral width of these Doppler frequencies will depend on target
ﬂuctuation and acceleration, antenna scanning effects, frequency variation in oscillators or components (for
example, due to microphonism from vibrations), but most signiﬁcantly, by the spectrum of the transmitter,
which inevitably will have noise sidebands that extend much higher than these Doppler frequencies, probably
by orders of magnitude. At higher microwave frequencies, the Doppler frequencies are also higher and more
widely spread. In addition, the spectra of higher frequency transmitters are also wider, and, in fact, the
transmitter noise-sideband problem is usually worse at higher frequencies, particularly at millimeter
wavelengths (i.e., above 30 GHz). These characteristics may necessitate frequency stabilization or phaselocking
of transmitters to improve the spectra.
Simpliﬁed block diagrams for CW Doppler radars are shown in Figure 20.8. The transmitter is a single-
frequency source, and leakage (or coupling) of a small amount of transmitter power serves as a local oscillator
signal in the mixer. This is called homodyning. The transmitted signal will produce a Doppler-shifted return
from a moving target. In the case of scatterometer measurements, where, for example, terrain reﬂectivity is to
be measured, the relative motion may be produced by moving the radar (perhaps on a vehicle) with respect to
the stationary target (Wiltse et al., 1957). The return signal is collected by the antenna and then also fed to the

mixer. After mixing with the transmitter leakage, a difference frequency will be produced which is the Doppler
shift. As indicated in Table 20.8, this difference is apt to range from low audio to over 100 kHz, depending on
relative speeds and choice of microwave frequency. The Doppler ampliﬁer and ﬁlters are chosen based on the
information to be obtained, and this determines the ampliﬁer bandwidth and gain, as well as the ﬁlter
bandwidth and spacing. The transmitter leakage may include reﬂections from the antenna or nearby clutter in
front of the antenna, as well as mutual coupling between antennas in the two-antenna case.
The detection range for such a radar can be obtained from the following (Nathanson, 1991):
R4 ¼

PTGTLTAeLRLpLaLssT
ð4pÞ2kTsbðS=NÞ
ð20:11Þ
where
R ¼ the detection range of the desired target

PT ¼ the average power
GT ¼ the transmit power gain of the antenna with respect to an omnidirectional radiator
LT ¼ the losses between the transmitter output and free space including power dividers, waveguide or
coax, radomes, and any other losses not included in Ae
Ae ¼ the effective aperture of the antenna, which is equal to the projected area in the direction of the
target times the efﬁciency
LR ¼ the receive antenna losses deﬁned in a manner similar to the transmit losses
Lp ¼ the beamshape and scanning and pattern factor losses
La ¼ the two-way-pattern propagation losses of the medium; often expressed as exp(2aR), where a
is the attenuation constant of the medium and the factor 2 is for a two-way path
Ls ¼ signal-processing losses that occur for virtually every waveform and implementation
sT ¼ the radar cross section of the object that is being detected
k ¼ Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 · 1023 W s/K)
Ts ¼ system noise temperature
b ¼ Doppler ﬁlter or speedgate bandwidth
S/N ¼ signal-to-noise ratio
Smin ¼ the minimum detectable target-signal power that, with a given probability of success, the radar
can be said to detect, acquire, or track in the presence of its own thermal noise or some external
interference. Since all these factors (including the target return itself) are generally noiselike, the
criterion for a detection can be described only by some form of probability distribution with
an associated probability of detection PD and a probability that, in the absence of a target
signal, one or more noise or interference samples will be mistaken for the target of interest.
While the Doppler ﬁlter should be a matched ﬁlter, it is usually wider because it must include the target
spectral width. There is usually some compensation for the loss in detectability by the use of postdetection
ﬁltering or integration. The S/N ratio for a CW radar must be at least 6 dB, compared with the value of 13 dB
required for pulse radars when detecting steady targets (Nathanson, 1991, p. 449).
The Doppler system discussed above has a maximum detection range based on signal strength and
other factors, but it cannot measure range. The rate of change in signal strength as a function of range
has sometimes been used in fuzes to estimate range closure and ﬁring point, but this is a relative
measure.
FMCW Radar
The most common technique for determining target range is the use of frequency modulation. Typical
modulation waveforms include sinusoidal, linear sawtooth, or triangular, as illustrated in Figure 20.9. For a
linear sawtooth, a frequency increasing with time may be transmitted. Upon being reﬂected from a stationary
point target, the same linear frequency change is reﬂected back to the receiver, except it has a time delay
20-19
Radar

which is related to the range to the target. The time is T ¼ (2R)/c where R is the range. The received signal is
mixed with the transmit signal and the difference or beat frequency (Fb) is obtained. (The sum frequency is
much higher and is rejected by ﬁltering.) For a stationary target the beat frequency for a sawtooth waveform
is given by
Fb ¼ 2R
c · DF · Fm
ð20:12Þ
FIGURE 20.9
Frequency vs. time waveforms for FMCW radar: (a) sinusoidal, (b) linear sawtooth, (c) triangular
modulations.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

and for a triangle wave the beat frequency is
Fb ¼ 4R
c · DF · Fm
ð20:13Þ
where DF ¼ frequency deviation and Fm ¼ modulation rate.
The beat frequency is constant except near the turnaround region of the sawtooth, but, of course, it is
different for targets at different ranges. (If it is desired to have a constant intermediate frequency for different
ranges, which is a convenience in receiver design, then the modulation rate or the frequency deviation must be
adjusted.) Multiple targets at a variety of ranges will produce multiple-frequency outputs from the mixer and
are handled in the receiver by a bank of range-bin ﬁlters as may be provided by digital signal processing using
fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques.
If the target is moving with a component of velocity toward (or away from) the radar, then there will be a
Doppler frequency component added to (or subtracted from) the difference frequency (Fb), and the Doppler
will be slightly higher at the upper end of the sweep range than at the lower end. This will introduce an
uncertainty or ambiguity in the measurement of range, which may or may not be signiﬁcant depending on the
parameters chosen and the application. For example, if the Doppler frequency is low (as in an altimeter) and
the difference frequency is high, the error in range measurement may be tolerable. For the symmetrical
triangular waveform, a Doppler less than Fb averages out, since it is higher on one-half of a cycle and lower on
the other half. With a sawtooth modulation, only a decrease or increase is noted since the frequencies
produced in the transient during a rapid ﬂyback are out of the receiver passband. Exact analyses of triangular,
sawtooth, dual triangular, dual sawtooth, and combinations of these with noise have been carried out by Tozzi
(1972). Speciﬁc design parameters are given later in this chapter for an application utilizing sawtooth
modulation in a missile terminal guidance seeker.
For the case of sinusoidal frequency modulation the spectrum consists of a series of lines spaced away from
the carrier by the modulation frequency or its harmonics. The amplitudes of the carrier and these sidebands are
proportional to the values of the Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind (Jn, n ¼ 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .), whose argument is
a function of the modulation frequency and range. By choosing a particular modulation frequency, the values of
the Bessel functions and thus the characteristics of the spectral components can be inﬂuenced. For instance, the
signal variation with range at selected ranges can be optimized, which is important in fuzes. A short-range
dependence that produces a rapid increase in signal, greater than that corresponding to the normal range
variation, is beneﬁcial in producing well-deﬁned ﬁring signals. This can be accomplished by proper choice of
modulation frequency and ﬁltering to obtain the signal spectral components corresponding to the appropriate
order of the Bessel function. In a similar fashion, spillover and reﬂections from close-in objects can be reduced
by ﬁltering to pass only certain harmonics of the modulation frequency (Fm). Receiving only frequencies
near 3Fm results in considerable spillover rejection, but at a penalty of 4 to 10 dB in signal-to-noise ratio
(Nathanson, 1991).
For the sinusoidal modulation case, Doppler frequency contributions complicate the analysis considerably.
For details of this analysis the reader is referred to Saunders (1990) or Nathanson (1991).
Interrupted Frequency-Modulated CW (IFMCW)
To improve isolation during reception, the IFMCW format involves preventing transmission for a portion of
the time during the frequency change. Thus, there are frequency gaps, or interruptions, as illustrated in
Figure 20.10. This shows a case where the transmit time equals the round-trip propagation time, followed by
an equal time for reception. This duty factor of 0.5 for the waveform reduces the average transmitted power
by 3 dB relative to using an uninterrupted transmitter. However, the improvement in the isolation should
reduce the system noise by more than 3 dB, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio (Piper, 1987). For
operation at short range, Piper points out that a high-speed switch is required (Piper, 1987). He also points
out that the ratio of frequency deviation to beat frequency should be an even integer and that the minimum
ratio is typically 6, which produces an out-of-band loss of 0.8 dB.
20-21
Radar

IFMCW may be compared with pulse compression radar if both use a wide bandwidth. Pulse
compression employs a ‘‘long’’ pulse (i.e., relatively long for a pulse radar) with a large frequency deviation
or ‘‘chirp.’’ A long pulse is often used when a transmitter is peak-power limited, because the longer pulse
produces more energy and gives more range to targets. The frequency deviation is controlled in a
predetermined way (frequently a linear sweep) so that a matched ﬁlter can be used in the receiver. The large
time-bandwidth product permits the received pulse to be compressed in time to a short pulse in order to
make an accurate range measurement. A linear-sawtooth IFMCW having similar pulse length, frequency
deviation, and pulse repetition rate would thus appear similar, although arrived at from different points
of view.
Applications
Space does not permit giving a full description of the many applications mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter, but several will be discussed.
Radar Proximity Fuzes
Projectiles or missiles designed to be aimed at ships or surface land targets often need a height-of-burst (HOB)
sensor (or target detection device) to ﬁre or fuze the warhead at a height of a few meters. There are two
primary generic methods of sensing or measuring height to generate the warhead ﬁre signal. The most
obvious, and potentially the most accurate, is to measure target round trip propagation delay employing
conventional radar ranging techniques. The second method employs a simple CW Doppler radar or variation
thereof, with loop gain calibrated in a manner that permits sensing the desired burst height by measurement of
target return signal amplitude and/or rate of change. Often the mission requirements do not justify the
complexity and cost of overcoming the short range eclipsing challenges associated with the radar ranging
approach. Viable candidates are thus narrowed down to variations on the CW Doppler fuze.
In its simplest form, the CW Doppler fuze consists of a fractional watt RF oscillator, homodyne detector,
Doppler ampliﬁer, Doppler envelope detector, and threshold circuit. When the Doppler envelope amplitude

derived from the returned signal reaches the preset threshold, a ﬁre signal is generated. The height at which the
ﬁre signal occurs depends on the radar loop gain, threshold level, and target reﬂectivity. Fuze gain is designed
to produce the desired height of burst under nominal trajectory angle and target reﬂectivity conditions, which
may have large ﬂuctuations due to glint effects, and deviations from the desired height due to antenna gain
variations with angle, target reﬂectivity, and fuze gain tolerances are accepted. A loop gain change of 6 dB,
(2 to 1 in voltage), whether due to a change in target reﬂection coefﬁcient, antenna gain, or whatever, will
result in a 2 to 1 HOB change.
HOB sensitivity to loop gain factors can be reduced by utilizing the slope of the increasing return signal, or
so-called rate-of-rise. Deriving HOB solely from the rate-of-rise has the disadvantage of rendering the fuze
sensitive to ﬂuctuating signal levels such as might result from a scintillating target. The use of logarithmic
ampliﬁers decreases the HOB sensitivity to the reﬂectivity range. An early (excessively high) ﬁre signal can
occur if the slope of the signal ﬂuctuations equals the rate-of-rise threshold of the fuze. In practice a
compromise is generally made in which Doppler envelope amplitude and rate-of-rise contribute in some
proportion of HOB.
Another method sometimes employed to reduce HOB sensitivity to fuze loop gain factors and angle of fall is
the use of FM sinusoidal modulation of suitable deviation to produce a range correlation function comprising
the zero order of a Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The subject of sinusoidal modulation is quite complex, but
has been treated in detail by Saunders (1990, pp. 14.22–14.46 and 14.41). The most important aspects of fuze
design have to do with practical problems such as low cost, small size, ability to stand very high-g
accelerations, long life in storage, and countermeasures susceptibility.
Police Radars
Down-the-road police radars, which are of the CW Doppler type, operate at 10.525 (X Band), 24.150 (K
Band), or in the 33.4 to 36.0 GHz (Ka band) range, frequencies approved in the United States by the Federal
Communications Commission. Antenna half-power beamwidths are typically in the 0.21 to 0.31 radian (12–
to 18–) range. The sensitivity is usually good enough to provide a range exceeding 800 meters. Target size has a
dynamic range of 30 dB (from smallest cars or motorcycles to large trucks). This means that a large target can
be seen well outside the antenna 3-dB point at a range exceeding the range of a smaller target near the center of
the beam. Thus, there can be uncertainty about which vehicle is the target. Fisher (1992) has given a discussion
of a number of the limitations of these systems, but despite these factors probably tens of thousands have
been built.
The transmitter is typically a Gunn oscillator in the 30 to 100 mW power range, and antenna gain is usually
around 20 to 24 dB, employing circular polarization. The designs typically have three ampliﬁer gains for
detection of short, medium, or maximum range targets, plus a squelch circuit so that sudden spurious signals
will not be counted. Provision is made for calibration to assure the accuracy of the readings. Speed resolution
is about 1 mph. The moving police radar system uses stationary (ground) clutter to derive patrol car speed.
Then closing speed minus patrol car speed yields target speed.
The limitations mentioned about deciding which vehicle is the correct target have led to the development of
laser police radars, which utilize much narrower beamwidth, making target identiﬁcation much more
accurate. Of course, the use of microwave and laser radars has spawned the development of automotive radar
detectors, which are also in wide use.
Altimeters
A very detailed discussion of FMCW altimeters has been given by Saunders (1990, pp. 14.34–14.36), in which
he has described commercial products built by Bendix and Collins. The parameters will be summarized below
and if more information is needed, the reader may want to turn to other references (Bendix Corp., 1982;
Saunders, 1990; Maoz et al., 1991; Stratahos, 2000). In his material, Saunders gives a general overview of
altimeters, all of which use wide-deviation FM at a low modulation frequency. He discusses the limitations on
20-23
Radar

narrowing the antenna pattern, which must be wide enough to accommodate attitude changes of the aircraft.
Triangular modulation is used, since for this waveform the Doppler averages out, and dual antennas are
employed. There may be a step error or quantization in height (which could be a problem at low altitudes),
due to the limitation of counting zero crossings. A difference of one zero crossing (i.e., 0.5 Hz) corresponds to
0.75 m for a frequency deviation of 100 MHz. Irregularities are not often seen, however, since meter response
is slow. Also, if terrain is rough, there will be actual physical altitude ﬂuctuations. Table 20.9 shows some of the
altimeters’ parameters.
These altimeters are not acceptable for military aircraft because their relatively wide-open front ends make
them potentially vulnerable to electronic attack (EA) or electronic countermeasures (ECM). A French design
has some advantages in this respect by using a variable frequency deviation, a difference frequency that is
essentially constant with altitude, and a narrowband front-end ampliﬁer (Saunders, 1990).
Doppler Navigators
These systems are mainly sinusoidally modulated FMCW radars employing four separate downward looking
beams aimed at about 15– off the vertical. Because commercial airlines have shifted to nonradar forms of
navigation, these units are designed principally for helicopters. Saunders (1990) cites a particular example of a
commercial unit operating at 13.3 GHz, employing a Gunn oscillator as the transmitter, with an output power
of 50 mW, and utilizing a 30-kHz modulation frequency. A single microstrip antenna is used. A low-altitude
piece of equipment (below 15,000 ft), the unit weighs less than 12 lb. A second unit cited has an output power
of 300 mW, dual antennas, dual modulation frequencies, and an altitude capability of 40,000 ft.
Phase Modulated CW Radar
An example of a phase modulated CW radar is a developmental obstacle avoidance radar described by
Honeywell. This 35 GHz radar is derived from a 4.3 GHz high duty cycle biphase modulated CW covert radar
altimeter waveform for helicopter low-level collision avoidance (Proctor, 1997). This obstacle avoidance radar
system, developed by NASA Ames and Honeywell, has a 20– vertical by 50– horizontal ﬁeld of view (FOV).
Figure 20.11 shows the radar on a helicopter.
This radar successfully detected metal high tension towers and cables, water towers and small radio towers,
wood telephone poles, vehicles, boats, fences, leaﬂess trees, and ground return at less than 4– grazing angle
(Raymer and Weingartner, 1994).
The radar requirements include 914.4 m (3000 ft) maximum range in 16 mm/h rainfall rate and for 20 dB
surface reﬂectivity for 5– grazing angle. The maximum velocity is 150 knots and the false alarm rate is 5%.
Low cost and low probability of intercept and detection were also required (Becker and Almsted, 1995).
Table 20.10 lists the radar parameters.
As described in Table 20.11, the 32 nsec biphase code chip corresponds to 4.8 m (16 ft) range resolution.
This will require a 31.3 MHz phase modulator and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sample rate of at
least 62.5 MHz, along with 62.5 MHz memory. A code sequence of at least 190 chips is required for 0.9 km
maximum range. For a maximal length code length of 190 the range sidelobe levels will be approximately
23 dB. The radar receiver must perform a 190-element correlation. For a brute force correlator this will require
190 multiplies every 16 nsec or 11.9 · 109 multiplies per second.

This example illustrates the challenges for ﬁne-resolution phase-modulated CW radar. As described in
Table 20.12 in order to achieve ﬁner range resolution shorter chip length is required which will require a
corresponding increase in the phase modulator bandwidth and the ADC sample rate along with the memory.
Longer unambiguous range or lower range sidelobe levels will require longer code sequences requiring a longer
correlator with more operations.
PILOT FMCW Radars
The PILOT radar from Saab Bofors Dynamics was ﬁrst developed in the 1980s. It is a navigation and detection
radar for use on ships and submarines that employs the FMCW waveform to achieve low probability of intercept
(LPI) performance. Table 20.13 lists the parameters of the PILOTradar and Figure 20.12 showsthe PILOT FMCW
radar units. The PILOT Mk3 version includes frequency agility over the 400 MHz bandwidth from 9.1 to 9.5 GHz
to enhance its LPI performance and a reﬂected power canceller (RPC) to permit the system to operate with
standard single navigation radar antennas. The PILOT transmit power of 1 W gives it the same average power and

detection range of pulsed navigation radars, but it enjoys an advantage relative to simple intercept receivers and
antiradiation missile (ARM) receivers that arenot matched to the FMCW waveform. In addition the operatorcan
reduce the transmit power in 10-dB increments down to 1 mW for operation at shorter ranges and against larger
targets (http://products.saab.se/PDBWeb/GetFile.aspx?pathtype ¼ ProductFiles&ﬁletype ¼ Files&id ¼ 1118).
Frequency Shift Keying CW Radar
CW radar can also use frequency modulation that steps back and forth between two frequencies. Eaton
VORAD radars use this frequency shift keying (FSK) CW waveform. One version operated at 24.725-GHz RF
center frequency dwelling approximately 5 msec at each of two frequencies separated by 500 kHz, which yields
300-m maximum unambiguous range. The radar had 0.5-mW transmit power, and 4.0– azimuth and 5.5–
elevation beamwidths (Will, 1995).
The Eaton VORAD model EVT-300 Collision Warning System operates at 24.725 GHz with 3 mW (typical)
transmitted RF power. The operating range is from 0.9 to 107 m (3 to 350 ft) with 0.5 to 120 mph host
vehicle speeds and 0.25 to 100 mph vehicle closing rates. Drivers’ warnings are issued via beeper and LEDs.
The ‘‘SmartCruise’’ add-on offers the adaptive cruise control (ACC) function (http://truck.eaton.com/na/

Terminal guidance for short-range (less than 2 km) air-to-surface missiles has seen extensive development in
the past two decades. Targets such as tanks are frequently immersed in a clutter background which may give a
radar return that is comparable to that of the target. To reduce the clutter return in the antenna footprint, the
antenna beamwidth is reduced by going to millimeter wavelengths. For a variety of reasons the choice is
usually a frequency near 35 or 90 GHz. Antenna beamwidth is inversely proportional to frequency, so in order
to get a reduced beamwidth we would normally choose 90 GHz; however, more deleterious effects at 90 GHz
due to atmospheric absorption and scattering can modify that choice. Despite small beamwidths, the clutter is
a signiﬁcant problem, and in most cases signal-to-clutter is a more limiting condition than signal-to-noise in
determining range performance. Piper (1987) analyzed the situation for 35- and 90-GHz pulse radar seekers
and compared them with a 90-GHz FMCW seeker. His FMCW results are summarized below.
In his approach to the problem, Piper gives a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of a pulse
system compared to the FMCW approach. One difﬁculty for the FMCW can be emphasized here. That is the
need for a highly linear sweep, and, because of the desire for the wide bandwidth, this requirement is
accentuated. Direct digital chirp synthesizers (DDCS) offer high ﬁdelity linear FM sweeps over wide
bandwidths. The STEL-2375B DDCS and the STEK-9949 DDCS from ITT Microwave offer 400-MHz
bandwidth with 0.23-Hz frequency steps (http://www.ittmicrowave.com/ddsModules.asp?subsection ¼ 0, 6
June 2004 and http://www.ittmicrowave.com/ddsModules.asp?subsection ¼ 1, 6 June 2004). The wide
bandwidth is desired in order to average the clutter return and to smooth the glint effects. In particular,
glint occurs from a complex target because of the vector addition of coherent signals scattered back to the
receiver from various reﬂecting surfaces. At some angles the vectors may add in phase (constructively) and at

others they may cancel, and the effect is speciﬁcally dependent on wavelength. For a narrowband system, glint
may provide a very large signal change over a small variation of angle, but, of course, at another wavelength it
would be different. Thus, very wide bandwidth is desirable from this smoothing point of view, and typical
numbers used in millimeter-wave radars are in the 450- to 650-MHz range. Piper chose 480 MHz.
Another tradeoff involves the choice of FM waveform. Here, the use of a triangular waveform is undesirable
because the Doppler frequency averages out and Doppler compensation is then required. Thus, the sawtooth
version is chosen, but because of the large frequency deviation desired, the difﬁculty of linearizing the
frequency sweep is made greater. In fact many components must be extremely wideband, and this generally
increases cost and may adversely affect performance. However, the difference frequency (Fb) and the
intermediate frequency (FIF) will be higher and thus further from the carrier, so the phase noise will be lower.
After discussing the other tradeoffs, Piper chose 60 MHz for the beat frequency. A modern FMCW system is
likely to use a lower beat frequency to reduce the ADC sample rate requirement for digital signal processing.
With a linear FM/CW waveform, the inverse of the frequency deviation provides the theoretical time
resolution, which is 2.1 nsec for 480 MHz (or range resolution of 0.3 m). For an RF sweep linearity of 300
kHz, the range resolution is actually 5 m at the 1000-m nominal search range. (The system has a mechanically
scanned antenna.) An average transmitting power of 25 mW was chosen, which was equal to the average
power of the 5-W peak IMPATT assumed for the pulse system. The antenna diameter was 15 cm. For a target
radar cross section of 20 m2 and assumed weather conditions, the signal-to-clutter and signal-to-noise ratios
were calculated and plotted for ranges out to 2 km and for clear weather or 4 mm per hour rainfall. The results
show that for 1 km range the target-to-clutter ratios are higher for the FMCW case than the pulse system in
clear weather or in rain, and target-to-clutter is the determining factor.
Summary Comments
From this brief review it is clear that there are many uses for CW radars, and various types (such as fuzes) have
been produced in large quantities. Because of their relative simplicity, today there are continuing trends
toward the use of digital processing and integrated circuits. In fact, this is exempliﬁed in articles describing
FMCW radars built on single microwave integrated circuit chips (Maoz et al., 1991; Chang et al., 1995; Haydl
et al., 1999; Menzel, 1999).
Deﬁning Terms
Doppler-frequency shift:
The observed frequency change between the transmitted and received signal
produced by motion along a line between the transmitter/receiver and the target. The frequency
increases if the two are closing and decreases if they are receding.
Missile terminal guidance seeker:
Located in the nose of a missile, a small radar with short-range
capability which scans the area ahead of the missile and guides it during the terminal phase toward a
target such as a tank.
Pulse Doppler:
A coherent radar, usually having high pulse repetition rate and duty cycle and capable of
measuring the Doppler frequency from a moving target. Has good clutter suppression and thus can see
a moving target despite background reﬂections.

Lightwave Waveguides
Samuel O. Agbo
Lightwave waveguides fall into two broad categories: dielectric slab waveguides and optical ﬁbers. As
illustrated in Figure 21.1, slab waveguides generally consist of a middle layer (the ﬁlm) of refractive index n1
and lower and upper layers of refractive indices n2 and n3, respectively.
Optical ﬁbers are slender glass or plastic cylinders with annular cross-sections. The core has a refractive
index, n1, which is greater than the refractive index, n2, of the annular region (the cladding). Light
propagation is conﬁned to the core by total internal reﬂection, even when the ﬁber is bent into curves
and loops. Optical ﬁbers fall into two main categories: step-index and graded-index (GRIN) ﬁbers. For
step-index ﬁbers, the refractive index is constant within the core. For GRIN ﬁbers, the refractive index is a
function of radius r given by

ð21:1Þ
In Equation (21.1), D is the relative refractive index difference, a is the core radius, and a deﬁnes the type
of graded-index proﬁle. For triangular, parabolic, and step-index proﬁles, a is, respectively, 1, 2, and 1.
Figure 21.2 shows the raypaths in step-index and graded-index ﬁbers and the cylindrical coordinate system
used in the analysis of lightwave propagation through ﬁbers. Because rays propagating within the core in a
GRIN ﬁber undergo progressive refraction, the raypaths are curved (sinusoidal in the case of parabolic
proﬁle).
21-1

Ray Theory
Consider Figure 21.3, which shows possible raypaths for light coupled from air (refractive index n0) into the
ﬁlm of a slab waveguide or the core of a step-index ﬁber. At each interface, the transmitted raypath is governed
by Snell’s law. As y0 (the acceptance angle from air into the waveguide) decreases, the angle of incidence yi
increases until it equals the critical angle, yc, making y0 equal to the maximum acceptance angle, ya. According
to ray theory, all rays with acceptance angles less than ya propagate in the waveguide by total internal
reﬂections. Hence, the numerical aperture (NA) for the waveguide, a measure of its light-gathering ability, is
given by
NA ¼ n0 sin ya ¼ n1sin p

For step-index ﬁbers, the preceding analysis applies to meridional rays. Skew (nonmeridional) rays have
larger maximum acceptance angles, yas, given by
sin yas ¼ NA
cosg
ð21:4Þ
where NA is the numerical aperture for meridional rays and g is the angle between the core radius and the
projection of the ray onto a plane normal to the ﬁber axis.
Wave Equation for Dielectric Materials
Only certain discrete angles, instead of all acceptance angles less than the maximum acceptance angle, lead to
guided propagation in lightwave waveguides. Hence, ray theory is inadequate, and wave theory is necessary,
for analysis of light propagation in optical waveguides.
For lightwave propagation in an unbounded dielectric medium, the assumption of a linear, homogeneous,
charge-free, and nonconducting medium is appropriate. Assuming also sinusoidal time dependence of the
ﬁelds, the applicable Maxwell’s equations are

Modes in Slab Waveguides
Consider a plane wave polarized in the y direction and propagating in z direction in an unbounded dielectric

Because the ﬁlm is bounded by the upper and lower layers, the rays follow the zigzag paths as shown in
Figure 21.3. The upward and downward traveling waves interfere to create a standing wave pattern. Within the
ﬁlm, the ﬁelds transverse to the z axis, which have even and odd symmetry about the x axis, are given,
respectively, by
Ey ¼ A cosðhyÞe jðotbzÞ
ð21:11aÞ
Ey ¼ A sinðhyÞe jðotbzÞ
ð21:11bÞ
where b and h are the components of k parallel to and normal to the z axis, respectively. The ﬁelds in the
upper and lower layers are evanescent ﬁelds decaying rapidly with attenuation factors a3 and a2, respectively,
and are given by

Only waves with raypaths for which the total phase change for a complete (up and down) zigzag path is an
integral multiple of 2p undergo constructive interference, resulting in guided modes. Waves with raypaths not
satisfying this mode condition interfere destructively and die out rapidly. In terms of a raypath with an angle
of incidence yi ¼ y in Figure 21.3, the mode conditions (Haus, 1984) for ﬁelds transverse to the z axis and with

Figure 21.4 (Palais, 1992) shows a mode chart for a symmetrical slab waveguide obtained by solving
Equation (21.13a) and Equation (21.13b). For the TEm modes, the E ﬁeld is transverse to the direction (z) of
propagation, while the H ﬁeld lies in a plane parallel to the z axis. For the TMm modes, the reverse is the case.

To obtain a single-mode waveguide, d/l should be smaller than the value required for m ¼ 1, so that only the
m ¼ 0 mode is supported. To obtain a multimode waveguide, d/l should be large enough to support many
modes.
Shown in Figure 21.5 are transverse mode patterns for the electric ﬁeld in a symmetrical slab waveguide.
These are graphical illustrations of the ﬁelds given by Equation (21.11) and Equation (21.12). Note that, for

TEm, the ﬁeld has m zeros in the ﬁlm, and the evanescent
ﬁeld penetrates more deeply into the upper and lower
layers for high-order modes.
For asymmetric slab waveguides, the equations and their
solutions are more complex than those for symmetric slab
waveguides. Shown in Figure 21.6 (Palais, 1992) is the mode
chart for the asymmetric slab waveguide. Note that the TEm
and TMm modes in this case have different propagation
constants and do not overlap. By contrast, for the symmetric
case, TEm and TMm modes are degenerate, having the same
propagation constant and forming effectively one mode for
each value of m.
Figure 21.7 shows typical mode patterns in the asymmetric slab waveguide. Note that the asymmetry causes
the evanescent ﬁelds to have unequal amplitudes at the two boundaries and to decay at different rates in the
two outer layers.
The preceding analysis of slab waveguides is in many ways similar to, and constitutes a good introduction
to, the more complex analysis of cylindrical (optical) ﬁbers. Unlike slab waveguides, cylindrical waveguides are
bounded in two dimensions rather than one. Consequently, skew rays exist in optical ﬁbers, in addition to the
meridional rays found in slab waveguides. In addition to transverse modes similar to those found in slab
waveguides, the skew rays give rise to hybrid modes in optical ﬁbers.

In Equation (21.17a) and Equation (21.17b), J‘ and Y‘ are
Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind and second kind, respectively,
of order ‘; I‘ and K‘ are modiﬁed Bessel functions of the ﬁrst

Ez and Hz in a ﬁber core are given by Equation (21.17a)
or Equation (21.17b), depending on the sign of k2b2. For
guided propagation in the core, this sign is negative to
ensure that the ﬁeld is evanescent in the cladding. One of
the coefﬁcients vanishes because of asymptotic behavior of
the respective Bessel functions in the core or cladding. Thus,
with A1 and A2 as arbitrary constants, the ﬁelds in the core
and cladding are given, respectively, by
cðrÞ ¼ A1J‘ðhrÞ
ð21:18aÞ
cðrÞ ¼ A2k‘ðhrÞ
ð21:18bÞ
Because of the cylindrical symmetry:

Thus, the usual approach is to solve for Ez and Hz and then express Er, Ef, Hr, and Hf in terms of Ez
and Hz.
Modes in Step-Index Fibers
Derivation of the exact modal ﬁeld relations for optical ﬁbers is complex. Fortunately, ﬁbers used in optical
communication satisfy the weekly guiding approximation in which the relative index difference, H, is much
less than unity. In this approximation, application of the requirement for continuity of transverse and
tangential electric ﬁeld components at the core-cladding interface (at r ¼ a) to Equation (21.18a) and
Equation (21.18b) results in the following eigenvalue equation (Snyder, 1969):

Solving Equation (21.20) allows b to be calculated as a function of V. Guided modes propagating within the
core correspond to n2wk0 # b # n1k. The normalized frequency V corresponding to b ¼ n1k is the cut-off
frequency for the mode.
As with planar waveguides, TE (Ez ¼ 0) and TM (Hz ¼ 0) modes corresponding to meridional rays exist in
the ﬁber. They are denoted by EH or HE modes, depending on which component, E or H, is stronger in the
plane transverse to the direction or propagation. Because the cylindrical ﬁber is bounded in two dimensions
rather than one, two integers, ‘ and m, are needed to specify the modes, unlike one integer, m, required for
planar waveguides. The exact modes, TE‘m, TM‘m, EH‘m, and HE‘m, may be given by two linearly polarized

In general, there are 2‘ ﬁeld maxima around the ﬁber core circumference and m ﬁeld maxima along a radius
vector. Figure 21.8 illustrates the correspondence between the exact modes and the LP modes and their ﬁeld
conﬁgurations for the three lowest LP modes.

Modes in Graded-Index Fibers
A rigorous modal analysis for optical ﬁbers based on the solution of Maxwell’s equations is possible only for
step-index ﬁber. For graded-index ﬁbers, approximate methods are used. The most widely used
approximation is the Wenzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) method (Marcuse, 1982). This method gives good
modal solutions for graded-index ﬁber with arbitrary proﬁles, when the refractive index does not change
appreciably over distances comparable to the guided wavelength (Yariv, 1991). In this method, the transverse
components of the ﬁelds are expressed as

Attenuation
The assumption of a nonconducting medium for dielectric waveguides led to solutions to the wave equation
with no attenuation component. In practice, various mechanisms give rise to losses in lightwave waveguides.
These mechanisms contribute a loss factor of eaz to Equation (21.10) and comparable ﬁeld expressions,
where a is the attenuation coefﬁcient. The attenuation due to these mechanisms and the resulting total
attenuation as a function of wavelength is shown in Figure 21.11 (Osanai et al., 1976). Note that the range of
wavelengths (0.8 to 1.6 mm) in which communication ﬁbers are usually operated corresponds to a region of
low overall attenuation. Brief discussions follow of the mechanisms responsible for the various types of
attenuation shown in Figure 21.11.
Intrinsic Absorption
Intrinsic absorption is a natural property of glass. In the ultraviolet region, it is due to strong electronic and
molecular transition bands. In the infrared region, it is caused by thermal vibration of chemical bonds.
Extrinsic Absorption
Extrinsic absorption is caused by metal (Cu, Fe, Ni, Mn, Co, V, Cr) ion impurities and hydroxyl (OH) ion
impurity. Metal ion absorption involves electron transition from lower to higher energy states. OH absorption
is caused by thermal vibration of the hydroxyl ion. Extrinsic absorption is strong in the range of normal ﬁber
operation. Thus, it is important that impurity level be limited.
Rayleigh Scattering
Rayleigh scattering is caused by localized variations in refractive index in the dielectric medium, which are
small relative to the optic wavelength. It is strong in the ultraviolet region. It increases with decreasing
wavelength, being proportional to l4. It contributes a loss factor of exp(aRz). The Rayleigh scattering
coefﬁcient, aR, is given by

Mie Scattering
Mie scattering is caused by inhomogeneities in the medium, with dimensions comparable to the guided
wavelength. It is independent of wavelength.
Dispersion and Pulse Spreading
Dispersion refers to the variation of velocity with frequency or wavelength. Dispersion causes pulse spreading,
but other nonwavelength-dependent mechanisms also contribute to pulse spreading in optical waveguides.
The mechanisms responsible for pulse spreading in optical waveguides include material dispersion, waveguide
dispersion, and multimode pulse spreading.
Material Dispersion
In material dispersion, the velocity variation is caused by some property of the medium. In glass, it is caused
by the wavelength dependence of refractive index. For a given pulse, the resulting pulse spread per unit length
is the difference between the travel times of the slowest and fastest wavelengths in the pulse. It is given by
Dt ¼ l
c n00Dl ¼ MDl
ð21:32Þ
In Equation (21.32), n00 is the second derivative of the refractive index with respect to l, M ¼ (l/c)n00 is the
material dispersion, and Dl is the linewidth of the pulse. Figure 21.12 shows the wavelength dependence of
material dispersion (Wemple, 1979). Note that for silica, zero dispersion occurs around 1.3 mm, and material
dispersion is small in the wavelength range of small ﬁber attenuation.
Waveguide Dispersion
The effective refractive index for any mode varies with wavelength for a ﬁxed ﬁlm thickness, for a slab
waveguide, or a ﬁxed core radius, for an optical ﬁber. This variation causes pulse spreading, which is termed
waveguide dispersion. The resulting pulse spread is given by
FIGURE 21.12

eff is the waveguide dispersion.
Polarization Mode Dispersion
The HE11 propagating in a single-mode ﬁber actually consists of two orthogonally polarized modes, but the
two modes have the same effective refractive index and propagation velocity except in birefringent ﬁbers.
Birefringent ﬁbers have asymmetric cores or asymmetric refractive index distribution in the core, which result
in different refractive indices and group velocities for the orthogonally polarized modes. The different group
velocities result in a group delay of one mode relative to the other, known as polarization mode dispersion.
Birefringent ﬁbers are polarization preserving and are required for several applications, including coherent
optical detection and ﬁber optic gyroscopes. In high birefringence ﬁbers, polarization dispersion can exceed
1 nsec/km. However, in low birefringence ﬁbers, polarization mode dispersion is negligible relative to other
pulse spreading mechanisms (Payne et al., 1982).
Multimode Pulse Spreading
In a multimode waveguide, different modes travel different path lengths. This results in different travel times
and, hence, in pulse spreading. Because this pulse spreading is not wavelength dependent, it is not usually
referred to as dispersion. Multimode pulse spreads are given, respectively, for a slab waveguide, a step-index
ﬁber, and a parabolic graded-index ﬁber by the following equations:
Dtmod ¼ n1ðn1  n2Þ

spread. It is given by
Dt2
T ¼ Dt2
mod þ Dt2
dis
ð21:37Þ
where
Dtdis ¼ total dispersion ¼ ðM þ MGÞDl
In a multimode waveguide, multimode pulse spread dominates, and dispersion can often be ignored. In a
single-mode waveguide, only material and waveguide dispersion exist; material dispersion dominates, and
waveguide dispersion can often be ignored.
Total pulse spread imposes an upper limit on the bandwidth of an optical ﬁber. This upper limit is equal to
1/(2DtT)Hz.

Introduction
Optical ﬁber communication links and networks use light as a signal carrier and optical ﬁbers as the
transmission media. The optical transmission system converts voice, video, or data from an electrical format
into a coded pulse stream of light using a suitable semiconductor light source. Optical ﬁbers then carry this
stream of light pulses to a regenerating or receiving station. At the destination the light pulses are converted to
electric signals, decoded, and transformed back into the form of the original information. Optical ﬁber links
are used for telecommunications, data transmission, military applications, industrial controls, medical
applications, and CATV.

Optical Fiber Applications
The physical properties of optical ﬁbers give them a number of inherent cost and operational advantages over
copper wires, and make them highly attractive for communication links. Included in these advantages are the
following:
. Long transmission distance. Optical ﬁbers have lower transmission losses compared to copper wires.
This means that data can be sent over longer distances, thereby reducing the number of intermediate
repeaters needed for these spans. This reduction in equipment and components decreases system cost
and complexity.
. Large information capacity. Optical ﬁbers have wider bandwidths than copper wires, which means that
more information can be sent over a single physical line. This property results in a decrease in the
number of physical lines needed for sending a certain amount of information.
. Small size and low weight. The low weight and the small dimensions ofﬁbers offer a distinct advantage over
heavy, bulky wire cables in crowded underground city ducts or in ceiling-mounted cable trays. This is of
particular importance in aircraft, satellites, and ships where small, lightweight cables are advantageous,
and in tactical military applications where large amounts of cable must be unreeled and retrieved rapidly.
. Immunity to electrical interference. An especially important feature of optical ﬁbers relates to the fact
that they consist of dielectric materials, which means they do not conduct electricity. This makes optical
ﬁbers immune to the electromagnetic interference effects seen in copper wires, such as inductive pickup
from other adjacent signal-carrying wires or coupling of electrical noise into the line from any type of
nearby equipment.
. Enhanced safety. Optical ﬁbers do not have the problems of ground loops, sparks, and potentially high
voltages inherent in copper lines. However, precautions with respect to laser light emissions need to be
observed to prevent possible eye damage.
. Increased signal security. An optical ﬁber offers a high degree of data security, since the optical signal is
well conﬁned within the ﬁber and any signal emissions are absorbed by an opaque coating around the
ﬁber. This is in contrast to copper wires where electrical signals often can be tapped off easily. This
makes optical ﬁbers attractive in applications where information security is important, such as
ﬁnancial, legal, government, and military systems.
Optical ﬁbers can be applied to interconnections ranging from localized links within an equipment rack to
links that span continents or oceans. Communication networks may be divided into the following four broad
categories:
. Local area networks (LANs) interconnect users in a localized area such as a room, a department, a
building, an ofﬁce or factory complex, or a campus. The word campus refers to any group of buildings
within reasonable walking distance of each other. For example, it could be the collocated buildings of a
corporation, a large medical facility, or a university complex. LANs usually are owned, used, and
operated by a single organization.
. Metropolitan area networks (MANs) span a larger area than a LAN. This can range from
interconnections between buildings covering several blocks within a city or could encompass an
entire city and the metropolitan area surrounding it. MANs are owned and operated by many
organizations. Typically MAN ﬁber optic implementations are referred to as metro applications.
. Access networks provide a high-speed, high-capacity means of interconnecting the metro resources with
communication entities located in LANs and at customer premises.
. Wide area networks (WANs) span a large geographical area. The links can range from connections
between switching facilities in neighboring cities to long-haul terrestrial or undersea transmission lines
running across a country or between countries. WANs invariably are owned and operated by many
transmission service providers.
The basic function of an optical ﬁber link is to transport a signal from some piece of electronic equipment
(e.g., a computer, telephone, or video device) at one location to corresponding equipment at another location

with a high degree of reliability and accuracy. Figure 21.13 shows the key sections of an optical ﬁber
communications link, which are:
. Transmitter. The transmitter consists of a semiconductor light source and associated electronic
circuitry. The source is about the size of a grain of salt in order to couple its light emission efﬁciently
into a ﬁber. The electronics set the source operating point, control the light output stability, and vary
the optical output in proportion to an electrically formatted information input signal.
. Optical ﬁber. The optical ﬁber is placed inside a cable that offers mechanical and environmental
protection. A variety of ﬁber types exist and there are many different cable conﬁgurations depending on
whether the cable is to be installed inside a building, in underground pipes, outside on poles, or
underwater.
. Receiver. Inside the receiver is a photodiode that detects the weakened and distorted optical signal
emerging from the end of an optical ﬁber and converts it to an electrical signal. The receiver also
contains ampliﬁcation devices and circuitry to restore signal ﬁdelity.
. Passive devices. Passive devices are optical components that require no electronic control for their
operation. Among these are optical connectors for attaching cables, splices for joining one ﬁber to
another, optical isolators that prevent unwanted light from ﬂowing in a backward direction, optical
ﬁlters that select only a narrow spectrum of desired light, and couplers that are used to tap off a certain
percentage of light, usually for performance monitoring purposes.
. Optical ampliﬁers. After an optical signal has traveled a certain distance along a ﬁber, it becomes
weakened due to power loss along the ﬁber. At that point the optical signal needs to get a power boost.
Traditionally the optical signal was converted to an electrical signal, ampliﬁed electrically, and then
converted back to an optical signal. The invention of an optical ampliﬁer that boosts the power level
completely in the optical domain circumvented these transmission bottlenecks.
. Active components. Lasers and optical ampliﬁers fall into the category of active devices, which require an
electronic control for their operation. Not shown in Figure 21.13 are numerous other diverse active
optical components. These include light signal modulators, tunable (wavelength-selectable) optical
ﬁlters, variable optical attenuators, and optical switches.
Electromagnetic Spectrum
To get an understanding of the distinction between electrical and optical communication systems and what the
advantages are of lightwave technology, let us examine the spectrum of electromagnetic (EM) radiation shown
in Figure 21.14.
All telecommunication systems use some form of electromagnetic energy to transmit signals from one
device to another. Electromagnetic energy is a combination of electrical and magnetic ﬁelds, and includes
power, radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays. Each of
these makes up a portion (or band) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The fundamental nature of all radiation

within this spectrum is the same in that it can be viewed as electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of
light, which is about c ¼ 300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. Note that the speed of light in a material is less than c.
The physical properties of radiation in different parts of the spectrum can be measured in several
interrelated ways. These are the length of one period of the electromagnetic wave, the energy contained in the
wave, or the oscillating frequency of the wave. Whereas electrical signal transmission tends to use frequency to
designate the signal operating bands, optical communications generally uses wavelength to designate the
spectral operating region and photon energy or optical power when discussing topics such as signal strength or
electro-optical component performance.
The optical spectrum ranges from about 5 nm (ultraviolet) to 1 mm (far infrared), the visible region being
the 400 to 700 nm band. Optical ﬁber communications use the spectral band ranging from 800 to 1675 nm.
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has designated six spectral bands for use in
intermediate-range and long-distance optical ﬁber communications within the 1260 to 1675 nm region. These
band designations arose from the physical characteristics of optical ﬁbers and the performance behavior of
optical ampliﬁers in multiple-wavelength systems. As shown in Figure 21.15, the regions are known by the
letters O, E, S, C, L, and U, deﬁned as follows:
1 . Original band (O band): 1260 to 1360 nm
2 . Extended band (E band): 1360 to 1460 nm
3 . Short band (S band): 1460 to 1530 nm
4 . Conventional band (C band): 1530 to 1565 nm
5 . Long band (L band): 1565 to 1625 nm
6 . Ultra-long band (U band): 1625 to 1675 nm

Optical Fiber Characteristics
Figure 21.16 shows the endface and a longitudinal cross-section of a standard optical ﬁber, which consists of a
cylindrical glass core surrounded by a glass cladding. The core has a refractive index n1 and the cladding has a
refractive index n2. Surrounding these two layers is a polymer buffer coating that protects the ﬁber from
mechanical and environmental effects. Traditionally the core radius is designated by the letter a. In almost all
cases, for telecommunication ﬁbers the core and cladding are made of silica glass (SiO2).
The refractive index of pure silica varies with wavelength ranging from 1.453 at 850 nm to 1.445 at 1550 nm. By
adding certain impurities such as germanium or boron to the silica during the ﬁber manufacturing process the
indexcan be changed slightly, usually as an increase in the coreindex. This is done so that the refractive index n2 of
the cladding is slightly smaller than the index of the core (i.e., n2 5 n1), which is the condition required for light
traveling in the core to be totally internally reﬂected at the boundary with the cladding. The difference in the core
and cladding indices also determine how light signals behave as they travel along a ﬁber. Typically the index
differences range from 0.2 to 3.0% depending on the desired behavior of the resulting ﬁber.
Light Propagation in Fibers
To get an understanding of how light travels along a ﬁber, let us ﬁrst examine the case when the core diameter
is much larger than the wavelength of the light. For such a case one can consider a simple geometric optics
approach using the concept of light rays. Figure 21.17 shows a light ray entering the ﬁber core from a medium
of refractive index n0, which is less than the index n1 of the core. The ray meets the core endface at an angle y0
with respect to the ﬁber axis and is refracted into the core where it now makes an angle y with respect to the
ﬁber axis. The behavior of a light ray at the interface between these two dielectric media can be described by
Snell’s law, given by
n0 cos y0 ¼ n1 cos y1
or equivalently as
n0 sin f0 ¼ n1 sin f1
where f ¼ y  90– is the angle with respect to a line perpendicular to the axis. Inside the core the ray strikes
the core-cladding interface at a normal angle f1. If the light ray strikes this interface at such an angle that it is
totally internally reﬂected, then the ray follows a zigzag path along the ﬁber core.
Critical Angle. Now suppose that the angle y0 is the largest entrance angle for which total internal
reﬂection can occur at the core-cladding interface. Then rays outside of the acceptance cone shown in Figure
21.17, such as the ray given by the dashed line, will refract out of the core and be lost in the cladding.
FIGURE 21.16

21-18
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

This condition deﬁnes a critical angle fc, which is the smallest angle f that supports total internal reﬂection at
the core–cladding interface.
Referring to Figure 21.17 from Snell’s law, the minimum angle f ¼ fmin that supports total internal
reﬂection is given by fc ¼ fmin ¼ arcsinðn2=n1Þ: Rays striking the core–cladding interface at angles less than
fmin will refract out of the core and be lost in the cladding. Now suppose the medium outside of the ﬁber is air
for which n ¼ 1.00. By applying Snell’s law to the air–ﬁber interface boundary, the condition for the critical
angle can be related to the maximum entrance angle y0,max through the relationship:
sin y0;max ¼ n1 sin yc ¼ ðn2
1  n2
2Þ1=2
where yc ¼ p=2  fc: Thus, those rays having entrance angles y0 less than y0,max will be totally internally
reﬂected at the core–cladding interface.
Optical Fiber Modes. Although it is not directly obvious from the ray picture shown in Figure 21.17, only
a ﬁnite set of rays at certain discrete angles greater than or equal to the critical angle fc are capable of
propagating along a ﬁber. These angles are related to a set of electromagnetic wave patterns or ﬁeld
distributions called modes that can propagate along a ﬁber. When the ﬁber core diameter is on the order of 8 to
10 mm, which is only a few times the value of the wavelength, then only the one single fundamental ray that
travels straight along the axis is allowed to propagate in a ﬁber. Such a ﬁber is referred to as a single-mode ﬁber.
The operational characteristics of single-mode ﬁbers cannot be explained by a ray picture, but instead need to
be analyzed in terms of the fundamental mode using the electromagnetic wave theory. Fibers with larger core
diameters (e.g., greater than or equal to 50 mm) support many propagating rays or modes and are known as
multimode ﬁbers. A number of performance characteristics of multimode ﬁbers can be explained by the ray
theory whereas other attributes (such as the optical coupling concept) need to be described by the wave theory.
Figure 21.18 shows the ﬁeld patterns of the three lowest-order transverse electric (TE) modes as seen in a
cross-sectional view of an optical ﬁber. They are labeled as the TE0, TE1, and TE2 modes and illustrate three of
many possible power distribution patterns in the ﬁber core. The subscript refers to the order of the mode,
which is equal to the number of zero crossings within the guide. In single-mode ﬁbers only the lowest-order or
fundamental mode (TE0) will be guided along the ﬁber core.
As the plots in Figure 21.18 show, the power distributions are not conﬁned completely to the core, but
instead they extend partially into the cladding. The ﬁelds vary harmonically within the core guiding region of
index n1 and decay exponentially outside of this region (in the cladding). For low-order modes the ﬁelds are
concentrated tightly near the axis of the ﬁber with little penetration into the cladding. On the other hand, for
higher-order modes the ﬁelds are distributed more towards the edges of the core and penetrate further into the
cladding region. The characteristic that the power of a mode extends partially into the cladding is important to
applications such as coupling of power from one ﬁber to another.

Variations of Fiber Types
Variations in the material composition of the core and the cladding give rise to the two basic ﬁber types shown
in Figure 21.19a. In the ﬁrst case, the refractive index of the core is uniform throughout and undergoes an
abrupt change (or step) at the cladding boundary. This is called a step-index ﬁber. In the second case, the core
refractive index varies as a function of the radial distance from the center of the ﬁber. This deﬁnes a graded-
index ﬁber. More complex structures of the cladding index proﬁle allow ﬁber designers to tailor the signal
dispersion characteristics of the ﬁber. Figure. 21.19b shows two of many different possible conﬁgurations.
Table 21.1 lists typical core, cladding, and buffer coating sizes of optical ﬁbers for use in tele-
communications, in a metro network, or in a LAN. The outer diameter of the buffer coating can be either 250
or 500 mm. Single-mode ﬁbers are used for long-distance communication and for transmissions at very high
data rates. The larger-core multimode ﬁbers typically are used for local area network applications.

The critical angle also deﬁnes a parameter called the numerical aperture (NA), which is used to describe the
light acceptance or gathering capability of ﬁbers that have a core size much larger than a wavelength. This
parameter deﬁnes the size of the acceptance cone shown in Figure 21.17. The NA is a dimensionless quantity
less than unity, with values ranging from 0.14 to 0.50.

through the equation n2 ¼ n1ð1  DÞ: Typical values of D range from 1 to 3% for multimode ﬁbers and from
0.2 to 1.0% for single-mode ﬁbers. Thus, since D is much less than 1, the approximation on the right-hand
side of the above equation is valid. Since the NA is related to the maximum acceptance angle, it may be used to
describe the light acceptance or gathering capability of a multimode ﬁber and to calculate the source-to-ﬁber
optical power coupling efﬁciencies.
Optical Fiber Attenuation
Light traveling in a ﬁber loses power over distance, mainly because of absorption and scattering mechanisms in
the ﬁber. The ﬁber loss is referred to as signal attenuation or simply attenuation. Attenuation is an important
property of an optical ﬁber because, together with signal distortion mechanisms, it determines the maximum
transmission distance possible between a transmitter and a receiver (or an ampliﬁer) before the signal power
needs to be interpreted or boosted to an appropriate level above the signal noise for high-ﬁdelity reception.
The degree of the attenuation depends on the wavelength of the light and on the ﬁber material.
Figure 21.20 shows an approximate attenuation-versus-wavelength curve for a typical silica ﬁber. The loss of
power is measured in decibels and the loss within a cable is described in terms of decibels per kilometer
(dB/km). Early optical ﬁbers had a large attenuation spike between 900 and 1200 nm due to the fourth-order
absorption peak from water molecules. Another spike from the third-order water absorption occurs between
1350 and 1480 nm for commonly fabricated ﬁbers. Because of such absorption peaks, three transmission
windows were deﬁned initially. The ﬁrst window ranges from 800 to 900 nm, the second window is centered
at 1310 nm, and the third window ranges from 1480 to 1600 nm. However, since the attenuation of highly pure
ﬁbers with low water content (known as full-spectrum ﬁbers) makes the designation of these windows obsolete,
the concept of operational spectral bands arose for the 1260 to 1675 nm region.
Light power also can be lost as a result of ﬁber bending. Fibers can be subject to two types of bends: (a)
macroscopic bends that have radii which are large compared with the ﬁber diameter, for example, such as those
occurring when a ﬁber cable turns a corner or when it is coiled within an equipment rack, and (b) random
microscopic bends of the ﬁber axis that can arise when ﬁbers are incorporated into cables. Since the microscopic
bending loss is determined in the manufacturing process, the user has little control over the degree of loss
resulting from them. In general cable fabrication processes keep these values very low, which is included in
published cable-loss speciﬁcations.
For slight bends, the excess optical power loss due to macroscopic bending is extremely small and is
essentially unobservable. As the radius of curvature decreases, the loss increases exponentially until at a certain
critical bend radius the curvature loss becomes observable. If the bend radius is made a bit smaller once this
threshold has been reached, the losses suddenly become extremely large. Bending losses depend on wavelength.

For a given bend radius, the loss is progressively greater at longer wavelengths. In some cases, near the critical
bend radius there can be a large difference in losses between operation at 1310 and 1550 nm. As a rule of
thumb, it is best not to make the bend radius of a standard telecommunications ﬁber be less than 2.5 cm.
Since often ﬁbers need to be bent into very tight loops within component packages, special ﬁbers that are
immune to bending losses have been developed for such applications. This class of specialty ﬁbers is described
later.
Fiber Information Capacity
The information-carrying capacity of the ﬁber is limited by various distortion mechanisms in the ﬁber, such as
signal dispersion factors and nonlinear effects. The three main dispersion categories are modal, chromatic, and
polarization mode dispersions. These distortion mechanisms cause optical signal pulses to broaden as they
travel along a ﬁber. If optical pulses travel sufﬁciently far in a ﬁber they will eventually overlap with
neighboring pulses, thereby creating errors in the output since they become indistinguishable to the receiver.
Nonlinear effects occur when there are high power densities (optical power per cross-sectional area) in a ﬁber.
Their impact on signal ﬁdelity includes shifting of power between wavelength channels, appearances of
spurious signals at other wavelengths, and decreases in signal strength.
Modal dispersion arises from the different path lengths associated with various modes (as represented by
light rays at different angles). It appears only in multimode ﬁbers, since in a single-mode ﬁber there is only one
mode. If many rays traveling at different angles are launched into a ﬁber at the same time in a given light pulse,
then they will arrive at the ﬁber end at slightly different times. This causes the pulse to spread out and is the
basis of modal dispersion.
In a graded-index ﬁber the index of refraction is lower near the core–cladding interface than at the center of
the core. Therefore in such a ﬁber the rays that strike this interface at a steeper angle will travel slightly faster as
they approach the cladding than those arriving at a smaller angle. Thereby the various rays tend to keep up
with each other to some degree. Consequently the graded-index ﬁber exhibits less pulse spreading than a step-
index ﬁber where all rays travel at the same speed.
The index of refraction of silica varies with wavelength; for example, it ranges from 1.453 at 850 nm to 1.445
at 1550 nm. In addition, a light pulse from an optical source is not a sharp line but instead contains a certain
slice of wavelength spectrum. For example, a laser diode source may emit pulses that have a 1-nm spectral

width. Consequently different wavelengths within an optical
pulse travel at slightly different speeds through the ﬁber.
Therefore each wavelength will arrive at the ﬁber end at a
slightly different time, which leads to pulse spreading. This factor
is called chromatic dispersion, which often is referred to simply as
dispersion. It is a ﬁxed quantity at a speciﬁc wavelength and is
measured in units of picoseconds per kilometer of ﬁber per
nanometer of optical source spectral width or ‘‘psec/(km nm).’’
For example, a single-mode ﬁber might have a chromatic
dispersion value of DCD ¼ 2 psec/(km nm) at 1550 nm.
Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) results from the fact that
light-signal energy at a given wavelength in a single-mode ﬁber
actually occupies two orthogonal polarization states or modes.
Figure 21.21 shows this condition. At the start of the ﬁber the
two polarization states are aligned. However, ﬁber material is not
perfectly uniform throughout its length. In particular, the refractive index is not perfectly uniform across any
given cross-sectional area. This condition is known as the birefringence of the material. Consequently each
polarization mode will encounter a slightly different refractive index, so that each will travel at a slightly
different velocity and the polarization orientation will rotate with distance. The resulting difference in
propagation times between the two orthogonal polarization modes will result in pulse spreading. This is the
basis of polarization mode dispersion. PMD is not a ﬁxed quantity but ﬂuctuates with time due to factors such
as temperature variations and stress changes on the ﬁber. It varies as the square root of distance and thus is
speciﬁed as a mean value in units of psec=

Note that tmod ¼ 0 for single-mode ﬁbers. As a rule of thumb, the information-carrying capacity over a certain
length of ﬁber then is determined by specifying that the pulse spreading cannot be more than 10% of the pulse
width at a designated data rate.
Optical Fiber Standards
The Telecommunications Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the
Telecommunications and Electronics Industry Associations (TIA/EIA) are the main organizations that have
published standards for both multimode and single-mode optical ﬁbers used in telecommunications. The
recommended bounds on ﬁber parameters (e.g., attenuation, cutoff wavelength, and chromatic dispersion)
designated in these standards assure the users of product capability and consistency. In addition the standards
allow ﬁber manufacturers to have a reasonable degree of ﬂexibility to improve and develop new products.
Multimode ﬁbers are used in LAN environments, storage area networks, and central-ofﬁce connections,
where the distances between buildings are typically 2 km or less. The two principal multimode ﬁber types for
these applications have either 50- or 62.5-mm core diameters and both have 125-mm cladding diameters. To
meet the demands for short-reach low-cost transmission of high-speed Ethernet signals, a 50-mm multimode
ﬁber is available for 10 Gb/sec operation at 850 nm over distance up to 300 m. The standards document TIA/
EIA-568 lists the speciﬁcations for such ﬁber. The ITU-T Recommendation G.651 describes other multimode
ﬁber speciﬁcations for LAN applications using 850-nm optical sources.
The ITU-T has published a series of recommendations for single-mode ﬁbers. The characteristics of these
ﬁbers are summarized in Table 21.2 and more details are given in the following listing.
ITU-T G.652A/B: This recommendation deals with the single-mode ﬁber that was installed widely in
telecommunication networks starting in the early 1990s. It has a Ge-doped silica core which has a diameter

between 5 and 8 mm. Since early applications used 1310-nm laser sources, this ﬁber was optimized to have a
zero-dispersion value at 1310 nm. The G.652B subclass meets stricter polarization mode dispersion tolerances
than the G.652A subclass.
ITU-T G.652C/D: Low-water-peak ﬁber for CWDM applications are created by reducing the water ion
concentration of the G.652 material in order to eliminate the attenuation spike in the 1360 to1460 nm E band.
The main use of this ﬁber is for low-cost short-reach coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM)
applications ranging from the O band through the L band. In CWDM the wavelength channels are sufﬁciently
spaced (20 nm apart) so that minimum wavelength stability control is needed for the optical sources. The
G.652D subclass meets stricter polarization mode dispersion tolerances than the G.652C subclass.
ITU-T G.653: Dispersion-shifted ﬁber (DSF) was developed for use with 1550-nm lasers. In this ﬁber type the
zero-dispersion point is shifted to 1550 nm where the ﬁber attenuation is about half of that at 1310 nm.
Although this ﬁber allows a high-speed data stream of a single-wavelength channel to maintain its ﬁdelity over
long distances, it presents dispersion-related problems in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM)
applications where many wavelength channels are packed with spacings of 0.8 nm or less into one or more of
the operational bands. As a result, this ﬁber type became obsolete with the introduction of G.655 NZDSF.
ITU-T G.654: This speciﬁcation deals with cutoff-wavelength-shifted ﬁber that is designed for long-distance
high-power signal transmission. Since it has a high cutoff wavelength of 1500 nm, this ﬁber is restricted to
operation at 1550 nm. It typically is used only in submarine applications.
ITU-T G.655A/B: Nonzero dispersion-shifted ﬁber (NZDSF) was introduced in the mid-1990s for DWDM
applications. Its principal characteristic is that it has a nonzero dispersion value over the entire C band, which
is the spectral operating region for erbium-doped optical ﬁber ampliﬁers. The G.655A ﬁber is intended for
DWDM use in long-haul telecommunications applications. The G.655B subclass was introduced in October
2000 to extend DWDM applications into the S band. Its principal characteristic is that it has a nonzero
dispersion value over the entire S band and the C band. This makes it very useful for metropolitan
telecommunications applications.
Specialty Fibers
Whereas telecommunication ﬁbers, such as those described above, are designed to transmit light over long
distances with minimal change in the signal, specialty ﬁbers are used to manipulate the light signal. Specialty
ﬁbers interact with light and are custom-designed for speciﬁc applications such as optical signal ampliﬁcation,
wavelength selection, wavelength conversion, and sensing of physical parameters.
A number of both passive and active optical devices use specialty ﬁbers to direct, modify, or strengthen an
optical signal as it travels through the device. Among these optical devices are light transmitters, optical signal
modulators, optical receivers, wavelength multiplexers, couplers, splitters, optical ampliﬁers, optical switches,
wavelength add/drop modules, and light attenuators. Table 21.3 gives a summary of some specialty ﬁbers and
their applications.
Cables
Cabling of optical ﬁbers involves enclosing them within some type of protective structure. The cable structure
will vary greatly depending on whether the cable is to pulled or blown into underground or intrabuilding

tubes (called ducts), buried directly in the ground, installed on outdoor poles, or placed underwater. Different
cable conﬁgurations are required for each type of application, but certain fundamental cable design principles
will apply in every case. The objectives of cable manufacturers have been that the optical ﬁber cables should be
installable with the same type of equipment, installation techniques, and precautions as those used for
conventional wire cables. This requires special cable designs because of the unique properties of optical ﬁbers
such as their strength, dielectric (nonmetallic) nature, small size, and low weight.
Cable Materials and Structures
Figure 21.22 shows a generic cable conﬁguration. To prevent excessive stretching, the cabling process usually
includes the incorporation of strength members into the cable design. This is especially important in the
design of aerial cables that can experience severe stresses due to factors such as wind forces or ice loading.
The strength member can be strong nylon yarns, steel wires, or ﬁberglass rods. A commonly used yarn is
Kevlar1, which is a soft but tough yellow synthetic nylon material belonging to a generic yarn family known
as aramids.
Individual ﬁbers or modules consisting of ﬁber groupings are wound loosely around the central member.
Groupings of up to 12 ﬁbers nominally are encapsulated by a miniature protective tube or by a wrapping tape.
A cable wrapping tape and optionally another strength member then encapsulate a multiple of these ﬁber
groupings.
Surrounding all of this is a tough polymer jacket that provides crush resistance and handles any tensile
stresses applied to the cable so that the ﬁbers inside are not damaged. The jacket also protects the ﬁbers inside
against abrasion, moisture, oil, solvents, and other contaminants. The jacket type deﬁnes the application
characteristics; for example, heavy-duty cables for direct burial and aerial use have thicker, tougher jackets
than light-duty cables for indoor use.
An important factor for using a cable in a building is the ﬂammability rating. The National Electrical Code
(NEC) in the United States establishes ﬂame ratings for cables, while on a global scale the Underwriters
Laboratories (UL) has developed cable test procedures. For example, the NEC requires that all cables which

run through plenums (the air-handling space between walls, under ﬂoors, and above drop ceilings) must
either be placed in ﬁreproof conduits or be constructed of low-smoke and ﬁre-retardant materials.
Fiber and Jacket Color Coding
If there is more than one ﬁber in a protective ﬁber encapsulation tube, then each ﬁber is designated by a
separate and distinct jacket color. The ANSI/TIA/EIA-598-A standard, Optical Fiber Cable Color Coding,
prescribes a common set of ﬁber colors. Since nominally there are up to 12 ﬁber strands in a single tube,
strands 1 to 12 are uniquely color-coded as listed in Table 21.4. If there are more than 12 ﬁbers within an
individual tube, then strands 13 through 24 repeat the same fundamental color code as those for strands 1
through 12 with the addition of a black or yellow dashed or solid tracer line, as noted in Table 21.4. For cables
having more than one encapsulation tube, the tubes also are color-coded in the same manner as the ﬁbers, that
is, tube 1 is blue, tube 2 is orange, and so on.
Ribbon cables follow the same color-coding scheme. Thus, one of the outside ﬁbers would have a blue
jacket, the next ﬁber would be orange, and so on, until the other outer edge is reached where, for a 12-ﬁber
ribbon, the ﬁber would be aqua (light blue).
Indoor Cable Designs
Indoor cables can be used for interconnecting instruments, for distributing signals among ofﬁce users, for
connections to printers or servers, and for short patch cords in telecommunication equipment racks. The three
main indoor types are described here:
1 . Interconnect cable. Interconnect cables are designed for light-duty low-ﬁber count indoor applications
such as ﬁber-to-the-desk links, patch cords, and point-to-point runs in conduits and trays. The cable is
ﬂexible, compact, and lightweight. Fiber optic patch cords, also known as jumper cables, are short
lengths (usually less than 2 m) of simplex or duplex cable with connectors on both ends. They are used
to connect lightwave test equipment to a ﬁber patch panel or to interconnect optical transmission
modules within an equipment rack.
2 . Breakout or fanout cable. Up to 12 ﬁbers can be stranded around a central strength member to formwhat is
called a breakout or fanout cable. Breakout cables are designed speciﬁcally for low to medium ﬁber count
applications where it is necessary to protect individual jacketed ﬁbers. The breakout cable facilitates easy
installation of an independent connector to each ﬁber. With such a cable conﬁguration, running
(breaking out) the individually terminated ﬁbers to separate pieces of equipment can be achieved easily.
3 . Distribution cable. Individual or small groupings of ﬁbers can be stranded around a nonconducting
central strength member to form what is called a distribution cable. This cable can be used for a wide
range of intra- and interbuilding network applications for sending data, voice, and video signals. If
groupings of ﬁbers are desired, they can be wound around a smaller strength member and held together

with a cable wrapping tape. Distribution cables are designed for use in intrabuilding trays, conduits,
backbone premise pathways, and drop ceilings. A main feature is that they enable groupings of ﬁbers
within the cable to be branched (distributed) to various locations.
For indoor cables the NEC requires that the cables be marked correctly and installed properly in accordance
with their intended use. The NEC identiﬁes three indoor cable types for different building regions: plenum,
riser, and general-purpose areas. A basic difference in the cable types is the material used for the outer
protective cable jacket. NEC Article 770 addresses the ﬂammability and smoke emission requirements of
indoor ﬁber optic cables. These requirements vary based on the particular application as described here:
. Plenum cables: A plenum is the empty space within walls, under ﬂoors, or above drop ceilings used for
air ﬂow, or it can form part of an air distribution system used for heating or air conditioning. Plenum-
rated cables are UL-certiﬁed by the UL-910 plenum ﬁre test method as having adequate ﬁre resistance
and low smoke-producing characteristics for installations in these spaces without the use of a conduit.
. Riser cables: A riser is an opening, shaft, or duct that runs vertically between one or more ﬂoors.
Riser cables can be used in these vertical passages. Riser-rated cables are UL-certiﬁed by the UL-1666
riser ﬁre test method as having adequate ﬁre resistance for installation without conduit in areas such as
elevator shafts and wiring closets. Plenum cables may be substituted for riser cables, but not vice versa.
. General-purpose cables: A general-purpose area refers to all other regions on the same ﬂoor that are not
plenum or riser spaces. General-purpose cables can be installed in horizontal, single-ﬂoor connections,
for example, to connect from a wall jack to a computer. However, they cannot be used in riser or plenum
applications without being placed in ﬁreproof conduits. To qualify as a general-purpose cable, it must pass
the UL 1581 vertical-tray ﬁre test. Plenum or riser cables may be substituted for general-purpose cables.
Outside Plant Cables
Outside plant cable installations include aerial, duct, direct-burial, underwater, and tactical military
applications. Many different designs and sizes of outdoor cables are available depending on the physical
environment in which the cable will be used and the particular application.
Aerial cable. An aerial cable is intended for mounting outside between buildings or on poles or towers. The
two main designs that are being used are the self-supporting and the facility-supporting cable structures. The
self-supporting cable contains an internal strength member that allows the cable to be strung between poles
without implementing any additional support to the cable. For the facility-supporting cable; ﬁrst a separate
wire or strength member is strung between the poles, then the cable is lashed or clipped to this member. Three
common self-supporting aerial cable structures are known as OPGW, ADSS, and Figure 21.20.
In addition to housing the optical ﬁbers, the optical ground wire (OPGW) cable structure contains a steel or
aluminum tube that is designed to carry the ground current of an electrical system. The metal structure acts as
the strength member of the cable. OPGW cables with up to 144 ﬁbers are available.
The all-dielectric self-supporting (ADSS) cable uses only dielectric materials, such as aramid yarns and glass-
reinforced polymers, for strength and protection of the ﬁbers. An ADSS cable typically contains 288 ﬁbers in a
loose-tube stranded-cable-core structure.
A popular aerial cable is known as a Figure 21.20 cable because of its shape. A key feature is the factory-
attached messenger, which is a support member used in aerial installations. The built-in messenger runs along
the entire length of the cable and is an all-dielectric material or a high-tension steel cable. This self-supporting
structure allows the cable to be installed easily and quickly on low-voltage utility or railway poles. In some
cases the steel messenger is placed at the center of a self-supporting aerial cable to reduce stresses on the cable
from wind or ice loading. This conﬁguration usually is for short distances between poles or for short distances
between adjacent buildings.
Alternatively a cable for an aerial application need not contain a built-in messenger. Instead a separate steel
messenger is ﬁrst strung between poles and the optical cable is then lashed to this messenger. This lashing
method supports the cable at short intervals between poles instead of just at the poles themselves, thereby
reducing stress along the length of the cable.
21-27

Armored Cable. An armored cable for direct-burial or underground-duct applications has one or more
layers of steel-wire or steel-sheath protective armoring below a layer of polyethylene jacketing as shown in
Figure 21.23. This not only provides additional strength to the cable but also protects it from gnawing animals
such as squirrels or burrowing rodents. For example, in the United States the plains pocket gopher will destroy
unprotected cable that is buried less than 6 feet deep.
Underwater Cable. Underwater cable, also known as submarine cable, can be used in rivers, lakes, and
ocean environments. Since such cables normally are exposed to high water pressures, they have much more
stringent requirements than underground cables. For example, they have various water-blocking layers and a
heavier armor jacket. Cables that run under the ocean have further layers of armoring and contain copper
wires to provide electrical power for submersed optical ampliﬁers or regenerators.
In addition to these designs, there are numerous other cable conﬁgurations for speciﬁc applications, such as
telecommunication ribbon cables, air-drop cables for emergency and military operations, small and extremely
ﬂexible cables designed for air-blown installation in ducts, and highly rugged cables for military, mining, and
petrochemical environments. Additional details on optical ﬁbers, cables, installation methods, and equipment
can be found in the books by Chomycz and by Keiser.

Introduction
Solid-state circuits are extensively used in such applications as radar, communication, navigation, electronic
warfare (EW), smart weapons, consumer electronics, and microwave instruments and equipment. This
chapter brieﬂy describes the performance status of ampliﬁers, oscillators, multipliers, mixers, and microwave
control circuits.
High-frequency circuits can be broadly categorized into three technologies:
1. High-density active circuits using established analogue integrated circuit design techniques
2. Planar transmission line circuits including active and passive components and interconnections
3. Intricate assemblies using active devices mounted in rectangular waveguides or quasi-optical systems
As a result of rapid development of high-performance deep submicron silicon technologies, the ﬁrst
technology is able to operate up to the tens of GHz range and is widely adopted for commercial products in
the wireless communications arena. These circuits almost always employ silicon technology and are referred to
as radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Single-chip transceivers have become commonly available and
the rapid development of this technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s has enabled a wireless connectivity
revolution and partly displaced established microwave design techniques (transmission lines, Smith charts,
electromagnetism, etc.) in the lower microwave bands.1 This type of solid-state circuit is not described in
detail in this chapter, but further information can be found elsewhere in the handbook.
At higher frequencies, especially above 20 GHz, and for many specialist high-performance components it is
still necessary to employ traditional transmission-line design techniques, and this leads to the second
technology type in which the active devices are closely integrated with transmission-line circuitry [2–4]; the
hybrid microwave integrated circuit (HMIC) consists of an interconnect pattern and distributed circuit
components printed on a suitable substrate, with active and lumped circuit components (in packaged or chip
form) attached individually to the substrate by the use of soldering and wire bonding. Alternatively, in the
monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), all interconnections and components, both active and

passive, are fabricated simultaneously on a semiinsulating semiconductor substrate (usually gallium arsenide,
GaAs) using deposition and etching processes, thereby eliminating discrete components and wire bond
interconnects. An exhaustive review of the history of HMIC and MMIC technology can be found in Ref. [5].
The term MMIC is popularly used for monolithic circuits operating in both the microwave (1 to 30 GHz) and
millimeter wave (30 to 300 GHz) regions of the frequency spectrum. Major advantages of MMICs include low
cost, small size, low weight, circuit design ﬂexibility, broadband performance, elimination of circuit tweaking,
high-volume manufacturing capability, package simpliﬁcation, improved reproducibility, improved reliability,
and multifunction performance on a single chip.
In the region above 100 GHz, two-terminal devices such as Schottky, Gunn, tunnel, impact avalanche and
transit time (IMPATT), and varactor diodes start to offer better performance than transistors, and planar
transmission lines often suffer from too much loss. This leads to the requirement for the third type of
technology in which very specialist devices are assembled into rectangular waveguide and similar transmission
media to achieve the best possible performance. Micromachining techniques are increasingly used to fabricate
these circuits with better precision than can be obtained from a mechanical workshop. These techniques are
widely used for submillimeter-wave and terahertz solid-state circuits. In passing, we note that the distinction
between these two terms is the subject of some debate but the IEEE standard deﬁnition of submillimeter waves
is the 300 GHz to 3 THz frequency range. At such high frequencies even rectangular waveguides have high loss
and there is a great deal of research activity on quasi-optical techniques where the ‘‘circuit’’ treats the signal as
a wave manipulated by antennas, lenses, holograms, mirrors, etc.
22.2
Device Technologies
In the vast majority of cases up to ,100 GHz, RFIC or MMIC technology is used nowadays to realize solid-
state circuits. Some exceptions are where extremely high-power or low-noise performance is required and
HMIC realization is used because of the lower transmission-line losses. A wide range of technologies has
evolved and the different active devices that can be used are as follows:
GaAs MESFET
GaAs HEMT
GaAs HBT
Silicon bipolar, CMOS, BiCMOS
Silicon-germanium HBT, HMOST
Indium phosphide HEMT or HBT
Gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) based devices
Two terminal devices; Gunn, Schottky, IMPATT, tunneling devices.
The GaAs MESFET (metal-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor) was the ﬁrst microwave transistor and is
still used extensively in many applications. It is easily fabricated using ion implantation for high-volume
applications and has good noise ﬁgure and quite high output power. GaAs foundries typically offer 0.5 mm
gate length MESFET processes, which are useful for circuits operating to 20 GHz. Figure 22.1 shows the typical
layout of a four-ﬁngered MESFET.
The GaAs-based pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) has a similar layout but the
high mobility afforded by the channel design offers a signiﬁcant increase in performance compared to the
MESFET. With gate lengths as short as 0.05 mm, circuits operating to over 100 GHz have been reported. For
higher performance the indium concentration in the channel must be increased beyond that which a GaAs
substrate can accommodate; lattice-matched HEMTs on indium phosphide substrates have produced excellent
high-frequency performance and MMIC ampliﬁers operating at over 200 GHz have been reported using InP-
based HEMTs.
The GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) has an advantage over the HEMT in that it is a vertical
structure with critical device dimensions which are deﬁned by the material growth and doping rather than by
lithography. An HBT with an emitter width of 1 or 2 microns can offer good microwave performance. Many
22-2

manufacturers are now offering HBT foundry processes,
most often in the GaAs/GaInP material system, because
there has been a move away from the use of aluminum
due to reliability problems. GaAs HBTs have found
widespread application in mobile handset power ampli-
ﬁers due to their good power efﬁciency and high
linearity.
Silicon bipolar technology has advanced tremendously
in recent years and the silicon-germanium HBT has been
reported to have f Ts of over 300 GHz. CMOS technology
has also advanced dramatically and 50 nm devices have
achieved f Ts of over 200 GHz. The major advantage of
silicon technology is that 300 mm silicon wafers are
readily available, whilst GaAs MMIC fabrication is
limited to 150 mm at the time of writing, and that
silicon microwave circuits can readily be integrated with
digital circuits, i.e., memory, DSP, and microprocessors.
However, silicon suffers from a substrate loss problem
that makes it difﬁcult to integrate active devices and low-
loss transmission lines. This makes it challenging to
realize millimeter-wave circuits, but already at the time of writing circuits operating at 77 GHz have been
reported. Crucially, the highly optimized silicon devices push the capability of the material to the limit and the
breakdown voltage of silicon devices does not match that of GaAs devices. GaAs pHEMTs can have 20 V
breakdown voltage compared with only 2 to 3 V for some SiGe HBTs, therefore GaAs can achieve higher
powers. Gallium nitride and silicon carbide technologies have even higher breakdown voltages due to the wide
bandgap materials. A discrete GaN HEMT device has been reported with 4200 W output power at 2.1 GHz
with operation from a 50-V supply [6].
InP devices achieve the highest levels of performance, but in manufacture the fragile substrate restricts wafer
sizes to even less than those of GaAs. The unique compatibility of InP HBTs and HEMTs with lasers and
photodetectors required for long-haul optical communications has led to tremendous interest in ultrahigh-
speed digital circuits such as dividers, multiplexers, and demultiplexers operating to 100 Gb/sec [7].
22.3
Ampliﬁers
There are six key microwave ampliﬁer design topologies, as illustrated in Figure 22.2. The reactively
matched ampliﬁer (a) uses purely reactive matching networks at the input and output of the transistor;
either lumped inductors and capacitors or transmission lines can be used. The technique gives moderate
bandwidth and good noise and power performance. However, because of the transistor inherent instability
and gain roll-off, wideband design is difﬁcult. Figure 22.3 shows a 20 to 40 GHz reactively matched GaAs
MMIC ampliﬁer and it can clearly be seen how the active devices, passive components, and transmission-
line matching elements are fabricated on a single chip with this technology. The lossy match ampliﬁer uses
resistors within its matching networks to enable ﬂat gain to be achieved over a broad bandwidth [8].
The most typical topology is to employ resistors in series with high-impedance stubs on both the input
and output, as shown in Figure 22.2. (b) At low frequencies the stubs have little electrical length, and the
resistors load the transistor and lower its gain. At high frequencies the resistors have little effect on the
transistor because of the inductive effect of the stubs. Hence, the matching networks can introduce a
positive gain slope to compensate the transistor’s gain roll-off. The feedback ampliﬁer (c) uses a resistance
(of the order of hundreds of ohms) from the drain to the gate. This has the effect of stabilizing the device
and can make the input and output impedances much closer to the desired 50 O. Closely related, the
popular Darlington pair conﬁguration (d) ensures a high gain-bandwidth product, and the resistor

feedback ensures a smooth broadband response with good input and output matches. Emitter resistors are
employed for stabilization of the operating point and for series feedback. This ampliﬁer topology is capable
of achieving more than dc to 40 GHz bandwidth; with HBTs (e) the balanced ampliﬁer is a generic approach
for improving matching and increasing output power. By operating an identical pair of ampliﬁers fed in
quadrature using directional couplers, the reﬂected signals are dumped into the load terminations. This is
especially valuable for the reactively matched ampliﬁer for controlling VSWR, when noise or power
matching is needed. Figure 22.4 shows the photograph of a 60 GHz SiGe HBT balanced low-noise
ampliﬁer (LNA) which achieved 14 dB gain and 6.3 dB noise ﬁgure [9]. In the distributed (or traveling-

overcome by incorporating the input and output
capacitances of a number of transistors into artiﬁcial
transmission-line structures. Table 22.1 compares
the performance of various distributed ampliﬁers in
terms of bandwidth and output powercapability. All
these operate down to low frequencies—as low as
30 kHz if suitable bias networks are designed.
Monolithic power ampliﬁer design involves
power combining as many devices as is practical in
order to achieve increased power. A single large
deviceisimpracticalonanMMICbecauseofthevery
low impedance level; the cluster matching technique
has emerged as the optimum means of integrating
the matching network into the splitting and
combining manifolds [17,18]. The 50-W MMIC
ampliﬁer [19] shown in Figure 22.5 illustrates very
clearly the output manifold. The insertion loss of
this output manifold imposes a practical limit on the
number of devices that can be combined, both for
economical reasons (wasteful use of expensive chip
space) and because the efﬁciency drops quickly as
the combining loss increases, causing a thermal
problem. Table 22.2 compares some MMICs that
have achieved the highest powers for various frequency ranges. The challenge in obtaining high power at
millimeter-wave frequencies and over multioctave bandwidths is evident from this comparison. To further
increase the achievable power it is necessary to power combine multiple MMICs. Depending on the frequency
this might be done at the package level or by using very low loss combining in waveguide, or even quasi-optically
as discussed later.

22.4
Oscillators and Multipliers
Solid-state oscillators represent the basic microwave energy source and have the advantages of light weight and
small size compared to microwave tubes. As shown in Figure 22.6, a typical microwave oscillator consists of a
MESFET as an active device (a diode can also be used) and a passive frequency-determining resonant element,
such as a microstrip, surface acoustic wave (SAW), cavity resonator, or dielectric resonator for ﬁxed tuned
oscillators, and a varactor or a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere for tunable oscillators. These oscillators have
the capability of temperature stabilization and phase locking. Dielectric resonator oscillators provide stable
operation from 1 to 100 GHz as ﬁxed frequency sources. In addition to their good frequency stability, they are
simple in design, have high efﬁciency, and are compatible with MMIC technology. Gunn and IMPATT
oscillators provide higher power levels and cover microwave and millimeter wavebands. The transistor
oscillators using MESFETs, HEMTS, and HBTs provide highly cost-effective, miniature, reliable, and low-noise
sources for use up to the mm-wave frequency range. Compared to a GaAs MESFET oscillator, a BJT or a HBT
oscillator typically has 6 to 10 dB lower phase noise very close to the carrier. Figure 22.6 shows the basic
conﬁguration of a dielectric resonator oscillator which is commonly used at microwave frequencies. The
feedback element is used to make the active device unstable, the matching network allows transfer of
maximum power to the load, and the dielectric resonator provides frequency stability.
In recent years the synthesized oscillator has become a key component in wireless transceivers, and a great
deal of research has been published on the design of integer-N and fractional-N phase locked loops. The
fractional-N method can give low phase noise and small frequency step size, but to reduce fractional spurs
requires advanced techniques employing S-D modulators and dithering [21,22].
Microwave frequency multipliers are used to generate microwave power at levels above those obtainable
with fundamental frequency oscillators. Several different nonlinear phenomena can be used to achieve
frequency multiplication, e.g., nonlinear reactance in varactors and step-recovery diodes, nonlinear resistance
in Schottky barrier diodes, and three-terminal devices (BJT, MESFET, HEMT, HBT). Figure 22.7 shows the
power available from carefully optimized Schottky varactor diode multipliers in the submillimeter range [23].
At the higher end of the THz range, quantum cascade lasers are being investigated by many researchers [24].
These, however, have the opposite power/frequency slope, leading to what has been termed the ‘‘terahertz gap’’
where neither electronic nor photonic solutions have yet generated sufﬁcient power from compact sources.
22.5
Mixers and Modulators
Mixers convert (heterodyne) the input frequency to a new frequency, where ﬁltering and gain is easier to
implement. A mixer converting the RF frequency to a low intermediate frequency (IF) is called a down-
converter, whereas a mixer converting an input IF signal to the RF frequency is called an up-converter. A mixer

is basically a multiplier that requires two signals and uses any solid-state device that exhibits nonlinear
properties. Mixing is achieved by applying an RF and a high-power local oscillator signal to a nonlinear
element, which can be a diode or a transistor.
There are many types of mixers such as single-ended, balanced, double-balanced, and even double-double-
balanced [25]. Mixers have for many years used diodes but can also be realized using the nonlinearities associated
with transistors that provide conversion gain. The most commonly used mixer conﬁguration in the microwave
frequency band is the double-balanced mixer having better isolation between the ports and better spurious
response. However, the single-ended and single-balanced mixers place lower power requirements on the local
oscillator and have lower conversion loss and are often preferred for submillimeter wave applications where LO
power is limited. Subharmonic mixing (where the local oscillator frequency is lower than that needed in
conventional mixers) has been extensively used at mm-wave frequencies. This technique is quite useful when
reliable stable local oscillators are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive at high frequencies.
Figure 22.8 shows the two most common mixer circuits; the double-balanced diode ring mixer and the
Gilbert cell. The former is common in MIC and MMIC applications and gives reasonable conversion loss with
good power handling (measured in terms of the third-order intercept point). In MMIC applications the
baluns, shown as wirewound transformers, are realized with planar forms of the Marchand balun [26–28]. At
lower frequencies, and especially in RFICs, the Gilbert cell mixer is almost always used for its compact size and
conversion gain. Often a whole transceiver will use balanced signals in order to ease RF grounding issues (due
to the virtual ground) and eliminate unwanted common-mode signals such as substrate noise and bounce
from digital circuitry; then, the baluns may be realized off-chip in the package.
In many wireless systems, and sometimes in radar transceivers, the direct conversion transceiver concept has
been adopted. Here, to enable a single-chip solution, the IF sections are removed and the mixers are then
required to translate the baseband information signal to and from the carrier frequency directly. For modern
digital communications, complex modulation is required (QPSK, QAM, etc.) and the vector modulator is
widely employed. As shown in Figure 22.9(a), this consists of a pair of mixers fed with quadrature LO signals.
The baseband I and Q signals modulate each arm independently and the two outputs are summed to give the
quadrature modulated RF output signal. On the receiver side the input RF signal is down-converted directly to

baseband, as shown in Figure 22.9(b). The A/D converters are shown to emphasize how modern RF design
spans a wide topic area from electromagnetism to digital signal processing (DSP). Converting directly to
baseband does mean that special attention must be paid to the mixer design to minimize unwanted signal
leakage, second-order intermodulation and phase noise. A number of researchers have proposed means of
addressing these issues [29].
22.6
Control Circuits
MMICs are extensively used for switching functions, and for amplitude and phase control. The best-known
application is in adaptive beam-formers for phased-array antennas. Other applications include switching for
redundancy or for antenna diversity, TX–RX switching for radar and communications, automatic gain
control, and direct carrier amplitude/phase modulation for communications.
Switches
FETswitches are common because the control electrode (gate) is isolated from the drain and source electrodes,
no dc-blocking capacitors are needed and negligible dc power is consumed. The FETswitch is a three-terminal

the drain-to-source resistance of the channel: At zero
bias the resistance is at a minimum, and at pinch-off
the channel resistance is very high. However, the

the intrinsic resistance of the channel itself, mean that
the ON-state resistance is never zero. A large gate-

capacitance which limits the OFF-state isolation of the
FET switch at high frequencies. The physical parameters of the device, such as channel geometry, gate length,
doping, and pinch-off voltage, can be optimized to produce switches with improved performance. Selective
ion implantation can be used to enable the use of high quality switch FETs on the same chip as standard
amplifying FETs.
The performance of a single FET switch is generally rather poor, and instead a combination of series and
shunt FETs is often necessary to provide low insertion loss and high isolation. Figure 22.10 shows the topology
of a typical reﬂective SPST switch, where C and 
CC are complementary control voltages. Figure 22.11 shows the
topology of a SPDTswitch. Since switches are passive elements they are capable of operating to surprising high
power levels, and MMIC switches capable of handling more than 100 W RF power have been reported [30].
Variable Attenuators
Attenuators can be designed for either digital or analogue control. Digitally controlled components have the
obvious advantage of compatibility with the processor controlling the system, and binary-weighted
attenuation values are generally used (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 dB). Analogue control has the advantage of
simplicity and provides continuous gain control. In the switched attenuator type [31], two single-pole
double-throw (SPDT) switches are used to switch the signal between a through line and an attenuator, as
shown in Figure 22.12(a). This technique is best suited to larger attenuation values, and the attenuator arm
can use a T- or p-type resistor network. The switched scaled-FET technique uses different sizes of FETs in
two paths connected between the input and output ports, as shown in Figure 22.12(b). The FETs are used as
switchable low-value resistances using the fact that the ON-state resistance depends on the gate peripheries

switch the resistors in or out of the circuit, as shown in Figure 22.12(c).
An analogue attenuator can be realized using a reﬂection-type topology in which variable resistance
devices are used to control the magnitude of the reﬂection coefﬁcient of the terminations [33], or,
rather than employing an attenuator, a variable gain ampliﬁer can be employed for continuous gain
control [34,35].

Solid-State Circuits

Phase Shifters
MMIC phase shifters can be implemented with either analogue or digital control. In the case of analogue
control most phase shifters are based on the continuous voltage control of a varactor diode’s capacitance.
Dual-gate FETs have also been used as analogue phase shifters but the performance is limited. Digital phase
shifters can have a number of topologies, but the general principle is either that the signal is switched between
two networks which have a ﬁxed phase difference, or the phase shift of a single network is controlled by
switching elements in or out of the network. A digital phase shifter will generally use binary weighting
(e.g., with separate networks for 22.5, 45, 90, and 180–) and generally a different technique is optimum for
each of these individual ‘‘bits.’’
In order to achieve constant insertion loss and good port matches almost all analogue phase shifters employ
the reﬂection-type phase shifter topology [36,37], as shown in Figure 22.13. The signal from the output port is
that reﬂected from the two varactor diodes. If the varactors are ideal variable capacitances then the magnitude
of their reﬂection coefﬁcient is ﬁxed at unity, but the phase varies from zero (no capacitance) to 180
(maximum capacitance,virtually short circuit). Thus, the phase of the output signal can be varied
continuously using the bias voltage on the varactor diodes. In practice, the phase shift range is limited and is
determined by the capacitance tuning ratio of the diodes.
The reﬂection-type topology can also be used for digitally controlled phase shifters. In this case the varactor
diodes are replaced with FET switches (for a 0/180– phase shifter bit) or with switched short-circuited
transmission-lines. In the latter case, a number of diode or FET switches are placed along the transmission
lines, as shown in Figure 22.14(a), and the one that is turned ON determines the point at which the line is
short circuited [38]. This switched-line approach can also be used more directly; the signal is simply routed
through one of two transmission lines of different lengths [39,40], as shown in Figure 22.14(b). However, it
should be noted that strictly speaking this becomes a time-shifter, and that the phase shift frequency response
would not be ﬂat. The length of the transmission lines precludes the full monolithic integration of the
switched-line topology at the lower microwave frequencies. Loaded-line phase shifters are more compact and
use a single transmission line which is periodically loaded with switchable reactive elements [41]. This method
has been used extensively [42,43], but can be difﬁcult to use for large values of phase shift because it is difﬁcult
to keep the line’s impedance constant.
The switched-ﬁlter phase shifter shown in Figure 22.14(c) employs SPDT switches to switch the signal
between a high-pass and a low-pass ﬁlter [44]. The ﬁlters have equal amplitude responses over the range
of interest, but the low-pass ﬁlter introduces phase-lag whereas the high-pass ﬁlter introduces phase-lead.
Using lumped elements for the ﬁlters makes this technique suitable for low-frequency applications.
In order to further reduce the size, it has been shown that FET switches can be directly integrated into
the ﬁlters, and the FET parasitic capacitances can be absorbed into the ﬁlter network [45].

Most of the topologies described so far can be used for a number of different phase shift bits. There is
another class of digital phase shifter where the phase shift value is ﬁxed intrinsically. For example, a 90– bit can
be realized using a switched-coupler approach [46] and a 180-bit can be realized by switching between the two
outputs of a balun which can be active [47] or passive [48].
22.7
Integrated Antennas
Above 30 GHz, the on-chip antenna becomes an effective means of coupling the signal into or out of the
MMIC. A major advantage of such an approach is the simpliﬁed packaging, with reduced bond-wire parasitics
and variability in production. However, the integrated antenna really yields the most beneﬁts when integrated

into arrays for imaging, beam steering, and spatial power combining. The grid ampliﬁer [49] shown in
Figure 22.15 is an important technique for spatial power combining, in which the input and output waves are
in orthogonal polarizations in order to achieve isolation, and a large MMIC contains the ampliﬁer array.
Spatial power combining is very important since the combining loss can be greatly reduced compared to
planar transmission lines, making it practical to combine the output power of hundreds of devices.
22.8
MEMS Technology and Micromachining
Micromachined silicon components, using selective crystallographic etching techniques, have been widely
developed for high-volume commercial markets, such as, air-bag sensors, displays, disk drives, and print-
heads. These miniature components are classiﬁed as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or
microsystems when moving parts are incorporated. For microwave circuits, MEMS technology has the
important feature of being able to realize moving parts for switching, tuning, and steering [50]. Figure 22.16
shows a switchable capacitor, for example, used as part of a reconﬁgurable impedance tuner [51]. The same
fabrication techniques can be used to construct transmission lines and passive components using air as the
main dielectric, leading to low loss. Figure 22.17 shows a low-loss 72 GHz power combining network which

was fabricated using micromachined waveguides [52]. Micromachining has also been extensively applied to
the realization of high-Q inductors on silicon substrates. Here, the challenge is to isolate the inductor from the
low resistivity substrate, especially for CMOS technology where the substrate resistivity is kept low, to
minimize coupling and bounce in digital circuits. Figure 22.18 shows an airbridge inductor that has an
inductance of 1.32 nH and achieved a Q of 70 at 6 GHz [53].

Summary and Future Trends
In this chapter we have brieﬂy described the performance of microwave and millimeter wave solid-state circuits.
Silicon technology has advanced dramatically and circuits operating to over 70 GHz have been realized in full
production processes. Up to 10- or even 20-GHz RFIC design techniques make use of established analogue IC
design techniques, rather than the traditional transmission line and Smith chart methods. GaAs, InP, and GaN
technologies have also advanced rapidly and ﬁnd special applications where high-power, low-noise, and
millimeter-wave operation are required. For optimum product design a range of technologies may be required
and the system-in-package approach has evolved as a high technology solution with concepts such as chip-scale
packaging being employed to realize truly 3D modules. The exploitation of the millimeter wave and terahertz
frequency ranges continues to advance rapidly and many advanced concepts such as spatial power combining,
quasi-optical techniques and MEMS technology require full usage of the principles of electromagnetism.
Fortunately, electromagnetic design software and powerful computers have developed in parallel to assist the
engineer with these challenges. These extremely high-frequency circuits enable a wide range of new applications
to be developed in communications, security, medicine, sensing, and imaging.

Until the 1940s, most electromagnetic (EM) problems were solved using the classical methods of separation of
variables and integral equations. Besides the fact that a high degree of ingenuity, experience, and effort were
required to apply those methods, only a narrow range of practical problems could be investigated due to the
complex geometries deﬁning the problems. While theory and experiment remain the two conventional pillars
of science and engineering, modeling and simulation represent the third pillar that complements them.
Computational electromagnetics (CEM) is the theory and practice of solving EM ﬁeld problems on digital
computers. It offers the key to comprehensive solutions of Maxwell’s equations. CEM techniques can be used
to model electromagnetic interaction phenomena in circuits, devices, and systems.
Commonly used numerical methods for solving EM problems include the method of moments, the ﬁnite
difference method, the ﬁnite element method, the Monte Carlo method, and the method of lines. In this
chapter, only the ﬁrst three will be presented because of their popularity and efﬁciency. Some commercial
codes developed for CEM will also be discussed.
23.1
Moment Method
The method of moments (MOM) is ﬁrmly established as one of the most powerful numerical tools used to
solve EM problems. Stated in a line, it is a technique by which one can convert an inhomogeneous functional
equation into a matrix equation that can be solved by known techniques. The error in the conversion process
can be reduced to zero or made small by making proper choices in its implementation. The seminal idea was
ﬁrst proposed by Galerkin, a Russian engineer, around 1920. A detailed treatment of the method, as applied to
EM problems, has been given by Harrington. The literature on MOM is enormous. In this section, we shall
ﬁrst brieﬂy explain the underlying concept and then furnish three numerical examples.
23-1

The Method
Subsequent to formulating an EM problem, one encounters the task of having to solve equations of the form:
Lf ¼ g
ð23:1Þ
where L is a linear operator, which could be differential, integral, or integro-differential, g is the known
excitation or source function, and f is the unknown quantity or response to be determined. We might have a
generalized view of Equation (23.1) by thinking that L could be operating on a set of functions called the
domain of L denoted by D(L), resulting in another set called the range of L denoted by R(L). Thus, we view f
as one member of D(L) and g as one of R(L). Further, we topologize these two sets by equipping them with a
suitable inner product. The inner product of two functions uðxÞ and vðxÞ, denoted by hu; vi is usually deﬁned
as
hu; vi ¼
Z
O
uðxÞv*ðxÞdx
ð23:2Þ
where the asterisk stands for the complex conjugation. The inner product is a scalar and gives a degree of
resemblance between u and v. It may be interpreted as the ‘‘projection’’ of u in the direction of v. Here, O is
used to indicate the domain over which u and v are deﬁned. We require that the inner product satisfy the
following properties:
hu; vi ¼ hv; ui*
ð23:3Þ
hau þ bv; f i ¼ ahu; f i þ bhv; f i
ð23:4Þ
hu; ui ¼ jjujj2 > 0
ð23:5Þ
where a and b are arbitrary scalars, jjujj is called the norm of u and is zero if and only if u ¼ 0.
Now to solve for f in Equation (23.1), MOM starts with the possibility of viewing f as a linear combination
of a set of basis functions { fn}:
f ¼
X
n
an fn
ð23:6Þ
where as are constants to be determined. Theoretically, in a typical case, the dimension of D(L) is inﬁnite and
thus n runs from 1 to 1 in the above summation. However, for practical purposes if we use only N basis
functions, the equality becomes approximate. Substituting Equation (23.6) in Equation (23.1) with ﬁnite N,
and using the fact that L is linear, we get:
X
N
n¼1
anLfn > g
ð23:7Þ
Assuming RN to be the residual error in the above approximation, we might write Equation (23.7) as
23-2
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

X
N
n¼1
anLfn ¼ gN ¼ g þ RN
ð23:8Þ
We note that g and RN are members of R(L). As we
want the best approximation, we wish to minimize
RN using a suitable criterion. From approximation
theory and from vector analogy, we know that this
is possible when g and RN are orthogonal as
illustrated in Figure 23.1.
Just as fn spans D(L), we could choose a set of
functions that span R(L) called weighting functions
denoted by {wm}, and let RN be orthogonal to each member of {wm} ensuring, hopefully, its orthogonality to g.
Again, we might need inﬁnite number of ws in theory, but we just take only N in practice, thereby limiting
ourselves to a subspace W#R(L). For ﬁnite N, this produces
hRN; wmi ¼ 0 for m ¼ 1; 2; ::: N
ð23:9Þ
With Equation (23.8) in the above:
X
N
n¼1
anLfn  g; wm

Or equivalently:

Computational Electromagnetics

If the matrix [lmn] in Equation (23.13) is nonsingular, it has an inverse [lmn]1 that can be found using known
techniques like Gauss elimination. Then, [an] would be obtained as
an

 ¼ ½lmn	1½ gm	
ð23:15Þ
This helps us to ﬁnd f. With the notation ½~ff 	 ¼ ½f1 f2    fN	, we can write
f ¼ ½~ff 	½lmn	1½ gm	
ð23:16Þ
The moment method attempts to equate the orthogonal projection of R(L) on to the space W spanned by
{wm} to that spanned by gN. The weighted error is thus minimized in this technique. There is an inﬁnite
number of possible sets of basis and weighting functions. Crucial to the effective working of the MOM is
the choice of these sets an engineer is supposed to make. This could be speciﬁc to the problem at hand,
but there are generic guiding rules to maximize success in obtaining accurate results with the least
computer time and storage. First of all, they should form a linearly independent set. In choosing {fn}, the
assumption of Equation (23.6) should be reasonably good. This choice is dictated by the boundary
conditions and the differentiability conditions in case of differentials in the operator L. In practice, the
basis sets may be put into two general classes. The ﬁrst consists of subdomain functions, which have ﬁnite
support along the domain of their deﬁnition. By this we mean the spatial surface of the electromagnetic
structure involved in the problem. The second class consists of entire domain functions with the support
over the entire domain, as the name suggests. These are chosen with some prior knowledge of the response
to be found, whereas, the subdomain class does not demand any prior knowledge. Examples of subdomain
basis are pulse, triangular or sinusoidal functions deﬁned on a smaller interval, but the union of their
supports covers the original domain. Next, {wm} should be in R(L). They ought to form a basis and as N
gets sufﬁciently large, they must be able to represent any arbitrary member in R(L). Hence, if they cannot
approximate g in R(L) to a high degree of accuracy the result would be a far cry from the true solution.
In particular, if R(L)#D(L), we might conveniently choose {wm} ¼ {fm}. The technique then goes by the
name of Galerkin’s method for this speciﬁc choice, but how do we know if R(L)#D(L) and if Galerkin’s
method is applicable? To understand this we consider what is termed the adjoint operator of L. We deﬁne
the adjoint of L as La when
hLu; vi ¼ hu; Lavi "u 2 DðLÞ; v 2 DðLaÞ
ð23:17Þ
It is known that
DðLaÞ ¼ NðLaÞ $ RðLÞ
ð23:18Þ
where D(La) is the domain of La, N(La) is the null space of La, R ðLÞ is the closure of R(L), and % is the direct
sum. Also N(La) and R ðLÞ intersect only at the identity point.
As R(L),D(La), and since it is easier to ﬁnd the latter than the former, we question if {wm} are in
D(La). If they are not in D(La), they cannot be in R(L). The dual argument settles the question of {fn}.
Thus Galerkin’s method is applicable when L ¼ La, in which case the operator is said to be self-adjoint,
leading to D(L) ¼ D(La). An alternative choice is to have impulses for {wm}, in which case the method
goes by the name collocation technique or point-matching. This is slightly simpler than Galerkin’s method
but slower in convergence. In most electromagnetic problems D(L)6¼D(La) and the use of Galerkin’s
method should be viewed with ‘‘a pinch of salt.’’ For instance, take the classic example of ﬁnding the
impedance of a dipole antenna, which involves solving Pocklington’s integral equation with a plane wave
excitation. If the piecewise sinusoidal expansion functions are used, they are zero at the ends of the wire,
therefore, they satisfy the boundary conditions that current should go to zero at the ends. However,
23-4
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

the function g in this case is supposed to be constant, which cannot be made up by the sinusoidal
expansion functions. If they cannot span the range R(L), they are not candidates which qualify as
weighting functions. So, Galerkin’s method is unsuited for solving Pocklington’s integral equation, in
principle. Whereas, Hellen’s integral equation is in terms of the vector potential, which is ﬁnite at the ends,
so Galerkin’s method might be used justiﬁably.
In the next section we shall give some numerical examples to describe the method. First we take a boundary
value problem from differential equations. Second, we take the problem of electromagnetic scattering from a
line source in the presence of a conducting strip of ﬁnite width. Third, we take an electrostatic problem of
ﬁnding capacitance of a square plate. All three, being introductory in nature, help the reader gain insight into
the implementation of MOM.

Radiation of a Line Source above a Two-Dimensional Strip of Finite Width
In this section we consider the radiation of an inﬁnite line source above a two-dimensional conducting strip of
ﬁnite width as shown in Figure 23.4. The line is along the z-axis and the strip of width w is h m below the line
symmetrically located from x0 ¼ w/2 to w/2. Using MOM, we solve for the current induced on the strip and
then obtain the radiation pattern due to the original line current and the induced current. The results are
compared to those obtained using physical optics and also method images.
The electric ﬁeld radiated by a line source of electric current Ie ﬂowing in the z-direction in the absence of
the strip is given by

To ﬁnd the scattered component we need to know the induced current. This can be posed as a problem of

An integral equation of the above form is called Fredholm’s Integral equation of the ﬁrst kind. To solve this, we
use MOM as outlined below.
Let us ﬁrst divide the domain of integration w=25x05w=2 into N equal subdivisions. We choose pulse

By choosing impulses for the set of weighting functions, we can use the point-matching technique. This
amounts to enforcing Equation (23.33) for the values of rm at N equidistant points on the strip collocated at
the centers of the subsections. In doing this, whenever the argument of the Hankel function is zero, the
integral cannot be evaluated numerically. So to resolve this problem we consider the thickness of the strip to be
nonzero and place the matching points along the line passing midway through the thickness, thus slightly
shifting them as shown in Figure 23.4. Here, the circle on the middle line of the strip shows the ﬁeld point and
the one on the top surface of the strip represents the source point. With this arrangement, we can rewrite
Equation (23.33) in matrix notation as

The evaluation of Zmn requires some care. The diagonal terms can be obtained by writing the asymptotic

crudely thought of as essentially constant. With these ideas, we can express:

ð23:39Þ
and the current density can be obtained using Equation (23.31).
We now provide some simulations. Suppose the parameters of the strip are w ¼ 2l, t ¼ 0.01l, h ¼ 0.5l.
Current density obtained with N ¼ 100, and point matching technique is plotted in Figure 23.5. Also, for

both line current and the induced current. For brevity, we avoid a few mathematical steps and directly give the

Numerical Evaluation of Capacitance of a Parallel Plate Capacitor
of Finite Plate Area
It is known from basic physics that the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor of plate area A, separation d,
and with a dielectric constant e is
C ¼ eA=d
ð23:44Þ
This formula is indeed simple, but not accurate. We need to consider the fringing effects of the ﬁelds at the
ends. Thus, a more accurate model of the practical capacitor with ﬁnite plate dimensions is to have the ideal
capacitor of value from Equation (23.44) in parallel with the fringing capacitor. To ﬁnd the total capacitance
we can use the MOM in the following way.
Consider a square conducting plate of side 2a lying in the xy plane around the origin as shown in Figure 23.7.
Let r(x, y) be the surface charge density on the plate. The potential at any point in space is given by

In Equation (23.47), (x, y) lies on the plate. If we
know the charge density r(x0, y0) we can deter-
mine the capacitance. Application of MOM starts
with the choice of basis function set to express the
required charge density. Let us pick pulse expan-
sion functions fn, whose value is unity on each
of the plate subsections of area Dsn shown in
Figure 23.7. With these members, we can write the

The three examples presented above are intended to give insight into the underlying concept and
implementation of the MOM. One might appreciate the generality of MOM in solving a wide class of problems.
The method is limited by the number of linear equations to be solved. Especially when the structures under
consideration are electrically large, we need to employ techniques such as conjugate gradient method.

Finite Difference Method
Many problems in engineering electromagnetics may be formulated in terms of partial differential equations.
The static ﬁelds are governed by Laplace and Poisson equations, which respectively, for the electric potential
are of the form:
H2f ¼ 0
ð23:55Þ
H2f ¼  r
e
ð23:56Þ
Another example is the dynamic ﬁelds in a waveguide satisfy the Helmholtz equation, which for a wave
function c is of the form:
H2 þ k2


c ¼ 0
ð23:57Þ
In radiation or scattering problems, the right-hand side of Equation (23.57) would be nonzero. The operator
L in the preceding section can now be related to the operators H2 and (H2 + k2) in the equations above. Only
in selected cases, one is able to obtain the exact analytic solutions, but when the geometries involved are
arbitrary, numerical methods are the preferred choice. Similar to MOM, the method of ﬁnite differences also
converts the operator equation plus the boundary conditions into a system of simultaneous equations.
Basically, the importance of the ﬁnite difference method (FDM) lies in the ease with which many logically
complicated operations and functions may be discretized.
The FDM was ﬁrst developed by A. Thom in 1920 under the name ‘‘the method of squares’’ to solve
nonlinear hydrodynamic equations. Since then, the method is used for solving problems occurring in various
engineering disciplines including electromagnetics. The next subsection offers the basic steps in the FDM
followed by three examples of its application.
Finite Differences
The ﬁrst step in solving an electromagnetic
boundary value problem using ﬁnite differences is
to obtain difference equations. Given a function
f(x) shown in Figure 23.8 one can approximate the
derivative, the slope of the tangent drawn at P,
using the values at A(xoh, f(xoh)), P (xo f(xo)),
and B (xo + h, f(xo + h)) in one of the three
possible ways

23-13
Computational Electromagnetics

The symbols D, H, and d respectively represent forward, backward (in the present context), and central
difference operators. From Figure 23.8, we understand that the slope of the tangent at P is approximately
equal to that of the chords PB, AB, and PA. Taylor series expansion of f ðxÞ around A and B reveals that
the forward, backward, and central differences are of orders, h, h, and h2, respectively. Thus, as the step
size h becomes smaller and smaller, we expect that truncation error reduces, but the round off errors
occurring in the calculations grows bigger and bigger. This is suggested in Figure 23.9. So, one has to
make a trade-off in the choice of step size.
Using central difference, the second derivative at P may be expressed as
f 00ðxÞ < df 0
h ¼ f ðx þ hÞ  2f ðxÞ þ f ðx  hÞ
h2
ð23:61Þ
The above may be extended for a two-dimensional scalar Laplace operator acting on a function f(x, y)
discretized (as shown in Figure 23.10) as
H2f ¼ q2f
qx2 þ q2f
qy2 < f1 þ f2 þ f3 þ f4  4f0
h2
ð23:62Þ
In certain applications, the boundary of the domain of interest might be irregular in shape and it is hard to
discretize the region unless one uses a ﬁne grid or a nonuniform grid. The Laplacean of f for a nonuniform
grid such as the one in Figure 23.11 would then be

Further, if the region of interest has multiple dielectrics or if the permittivity varies from point to point, we
need to modify the preceding approximations. For instance, consider the interface between two dielectrics as
shown in Figure 23.12. Gauss’s law states that

With the ﬁnite difference formulas as derived above, we can
now outline the method of solving a Laplace equation. The
steps involved are: (1) Divide the domain of interest into a
suitably ﬁne grid. (2) Apply the relevant ﬁnite difference
formula at each node of the grid to obtain a system of
simultaneous equations in terms of the discrete values of
the unknown. In this process some nodes called ﬁxed nodes
that fall on the boundary have known values set by the
boundary
conditions,
the
remaining
nodes
where
the function is unknown are called free nodes. (3) Solve
the system of equations either directly or iteratively for the
unknowns.
Let us ﬁrst take a simple problem of solving Laplace
Equation (23.55) in a rectangular region with a homogenous
dielectric subject to the boundary conditions shown in
Figure 23.13.
Application of ﬁnite differences with a grid of size 40 · 30
gives the potential, which is sketched in Figure 23.14.
Next let us consider a cylindrical region with multiple
dielectrics shown in Figure 23.15. The geometry in the
problem has an inner conductor at r ¼ a, and an outer
conductor at r ¼ d. The space in between is ﬁlled with three
different layers of thickness ba, cb, dc with permittiv-
ities e1, e2, and e3, respectively. For the numerical values
a ¼ 2, b ¼ 6, c ¼ 10, d ¼ 14; e1 ¼ 14, e2 ¼ 4, e3 ¼ 10, and for
F ¼ 0 at r ¼ a, and F ¼ 10 at r ¼ d, over a grid size of
60 · 60, FDM furnishes the solution shown in Figure 23.16.
The idea behind ﬁnite differences is extended to time-
varying ﬁelds in the ﬁnite-difference time-domain technique
discussed next.
The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method (FDTD)
This was ﬁrst introduced by Yee in 1966 and later developed
by Taﬂove and others. In this method, essentially the
Maxwell’s curl equations are rewritten using ﬁnite difference
notation. The principal idea in this method is to employ time
and space centered approximations for the derivatives
occurring in the Maxwell’s equations with a second-order
accuracy. In an isotropic medium, Maxwell’s equations can
be written as

In applying Equation (23.69) to all the space derivatives in Equation (23.66), Yee positions the components of
E and H about a unit cell of lattice as shown in Figure 23.17. To incorporate Equation (23.70), the components
of E and H are evaluated at alternate half-time steps. Thus, we obtain the explicit ﬁnite difference

Notice from Equation (23.71) that the components of E and H are interlaced within the unit cell and are
evaluated at alternate half-time steps. All the ﬁeld components are present in a quarter of a unit cell. In
translating the system of Equation (23.71) into a computer code one must make sure that, within the same
time loop, one type of ﬁeld components is calculated ﬁrst and the results obtained are then used in calculating
another type.
To ensure accuracy of the computed results, the spatial increment d must be small compared to the
wavelength (usually #l/10) or the minimum dimension of the conducting body. This amounts to having ten
or more cells per wavelength. To ensure the stability of the FDTD scheme, the time increment must satisfy:
umaxDt <
1
Dx2 þ 1
Dy2 þ 1
Dz2

1=2
ð23:72Þ
where umax is the maximum phase velocity within the model. Equation (23.72) is called the Courant
stability condition. Since we are using a cubic cell with Dx ¼ Dy ¼ Dz ¼ d, Equation (23.72) becomes
umaxDt
d
< 1ﬃﬃn
p
ð23:73Þ
where n is the number of space dimensions. For practical reasons, it is preferable to choose a ratio of time
increment to spatial increment as large as possible, yet satisfying Equation (23.73).
A basic difﬁculty encountered in applying the FDTD method to problems involving open or
unbounded geometries is that the domain in which the ﬁeld exists is inﬁnite. Since no computer can store
unlimited data, we should devise a scheme to conﬁne our solution to a ﬁnite region. In other words, artiﬁcial
boundaries must be simulated so that a numerical illusion is created. The conditions under which this can
happen are called radiation conditions, absorbing boundary conditions, or lattice truncation conditions.
The FDTD method has several advantages. It is conceptually simple. It can treat even inhomogeneous
conducting or dielectric structures of complex geometries because the medium parameters can be assigned to
each lattice point. It also permits computation of the solution in the frequency domain from a single time-
domain simulation via Fourier transform techniques. A disadvantage of the method is that it necessitates
modeling of an object as well as its surroundings. Thus, the program execution time may be excessive. Its
accuracy is at least one order of magnitude less than that of the moment method. Despite these limitations, the
FDTD method has been successfully applied to solve scattering and other problems including aperture
penetration, antenna/radiation problems, microwave circuits, eigenvalue problems, and EM absorption in
human tissues.
23.3
Finite Element Method
Like the ﬁnite difference method and the moment method, the ﬁnite element method is useful in solving
electromagnetic problems. Application of the ﬁnite difference and moment methods becomes difﬁcult with
irregularly shaped boundaries. Such problems can be handled more easily using the ﬁnite element method.
The ﬁnite element analysis of any problem involves basically four steps: (a) discretizing the solution region
into a ﬁnite number of subregions called elements, (b) deriving governing equations for a typical element,
23-19
Computational Electromagnetics

(c) assembling of all elements in the solution region, and (d) solving the system of equations obtained. These
steps are best shown with an example.
Suppose we desire to solve a Laplace equation (H2V ¼ 0) in a two-dimensional domain. The domain is ﬁrst
divided into triangular elements. This is usually done either by hand or by an automatic mesh generator. We
seek an approximation for the potential Ve within an element and then interrelate the potential distribution in
various elements such that the potential is continuous across interelement boundaries. The approximate
solution for the entire region is
Vðx; yÞ .
X
N
e¼1
Veðx; yÞ
ð23:74Þ
where N is the number of triangular elements into which the region has been divided. The most common form
of approximation for Ve within an element is polynomial approximation, namely:
Veðx; yÞ ¼ a þ bx þ cy
ð23:75Þ
Consider a typical triangular element shown in Figure 23.18. The potential Ve1, Ve2, and Ve3 at nodes 1, 2, and
3 respectively, are obtained from Equation (23.75) as

The matrix element CðeÞ

n is the number of nodes, N is the number of elements, and [C] is called the over-all or global coefﬁcient matrix
which is the assemblage of individual element coefﬁcient matrices. Notice that to obtain Equation (23.87), we
have assumed that the whole solution is homogeneous so that e is constant. For an inhomogeneous solution
region, the region is discretized such that each ﬁnite element is homogeneous. In this case, Equation (23.85)
still holds but Equation (23.87) does not apply since e ¼ eoer varies from element to element. To apply
Equation (23.87), we may replace e by eo and multiply the integrand in Equation (23.84) by er.
The last step is to solve the resulting equations. It can be shown that Laplace’s (or Poisson’s) equation is
satisﬁed when the total energy in the solution region is minimum. Thus, we require that the partial derivatives
of W with respect to each nodal value of the potential be zero, i.e.:
qW

Equation (23.95) can be applied to every element in the solution region. All the resulting equations can be
assembled into one global discretized functional. We obtain the discretized functional for the whole solution
region (with N elements and n nodes) as the sum of the functionals for the individual elements, i.e., from
Equation (23.95):

In Equation (23.98), the column matrix [V] consists of the values of Vei while the column matrix [r] contains
n values of the source function rs at the nodes. The functional in Equation (23.98) is now minimized by
differentiating with respect to Vei and setting the result equal to zero. The resulting equations can be solved
either by the iteration method or band matrix method.
Similarly, the FEM can be applied to the wave equation. A typical wave equation is the inhomogeneous
scalar Helmholtz’s equation:
H2F þ k2F ¼ g
ð23:99Þ

where F is the potential (for waveguide problem, F ¼ Hz for TE mode or Ez for TM mode) to be determined,

Solution of the algebraic eigenvalue problem in Equation (23.109) furnishes eigenvalues and eigenvectors
which form good approximations to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz problem, i.e., the
cutoff wavelengths and ﬁeld distribution patterns of the various modes possible in a given waveguide.
The ﬁnite element approximation we have used so far has been the linear type. A higher order element is
one in which the shape functions or interpolation polynomial is of order 2 or more. The accuracy of a ﬁnite
element solution can be improved by using ﬁner mesh or using higher order elements or both. In general,
fewer higher order elements are needed to achieve the same degree of accuracy in the ﬁnal results. The higher
order elements are particularly useful when the gradient of the ﬁeld variable is expected to vary rapidly. They
have been applied with great success in solving EM-related problems.
The ﬁnite element techniques developed thus far are for two-dimensional elements. The idea can be
extended to three-dimensional elements. We ﬁrst divide the solution region into tetrahedral or hexahedral
(rectangular prism) elements. One would expect three-dimensional problems to require a large total number
of elements to achieve an accurate result and demand a large storage capacity and computation time.
23.4
Commercial Packages for CEM
Numerical modeling and simulation have revolutionized all aspects of engineering design. As a result, several
software packages that have been developed to aid designing and modeling. Widely used software packages for
CEM include Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC), and its PC version (MININEC) based on the method of
moments and developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, High Frequency Structure Simulator
(HFSS) based on ﬁnite element method and developed by Ansoft, Microwave Ofﬁce based on the method of
moments and developed by Applied Wave Research, FEMLAB (which stands for ﬁnite element modeling
laboratory) from Comsol, Sonnet developed by Sonnet, and IE3D from Zeland Software. These software
applications put powerful tools and techniques, previously available only to full-time theorists, into the hands
of engineers not formally trained in CEM. The best method or software package to use depends on the
particular problem one is trying to solve. Substantial progress has been made in CEM and further gains have
been derived from the availability of these powerful commerical packages. Still, the available modeling tools
sometimes fall short of the user’s need.

Introduction
Electroacoustics is concerned with the transduction of acoustical to electrical energy and vice versa.
Transducers that convert acoustical signals into electrical signals are referred to as ‘‘microphones’’ or
‘‘hydrophones’’, depending on whether the acoustic medium is air or water, respectively. Transducers that
convert electrical signals into acoustical waves are referred to as loudspeakers (or earphones) in air and
projectors in water.
24.2
Transduction Mechanisms
Piezoelectricity
Certain crystals produce charge on their surfaces when strained or conversely become strained when placed in
an electric ﬁeld. Important piezelectric crystals include quartz, ADP, lithium sulfate, Rochelle salt, and
tourmaline. Lithium sulfate and tourmaline are volume expanders; that is, their volume changes when
subjected to an electric ﬁeld in the proper direction. Such crystals can detect hydrostatic pressure directly.
Crystals that are not volume expanders must have one or more surfaces shielded from the pressure ﬁeld in
order to convert the pressure to a uniaxial strain that can be detected. Tourmaline is relatively insensitive and
used primarily in blast gauges, while quartz is used principally in high-Q ultrasonic transducers.
It has been discovered that certain polymers, notably polyvinylidene ﬂuoride, can be made piezoelectric
during manufacture by stretching. Such piezoelectric polymers are ﬁnding use in directional microphones and
ultrasonic hydrophones.
24-1

Electrostriction
Certain materials, such as lead titanate, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), barium titanate, and lead magnesium
niobate (PMN), are ferroelectric and exhibit strong electrostriction. Since barium titanate and PZT have large
remanent polarization, they can be permanently polarized, which linearizes the quadratic electrostrictive effect
and makes them equivalent to piezoelectric materials for most practical purposes. These materials are used
mainly as ceramics, but some have recently become available as single crystals of sufﬁcient size for transducer
use. They are capable of producing very large forces, and are used extensively as sources and receivers for
underwater sound. PZT and barium titanate have only a small volume sensitivity; hence, they must have one
or more surfaces shielded in order to detect sound efﬁciently. Piezoelectric ceramics have extraordinarily high
dielectric coefﬁcients and hence high capacitance, and they are thus capable of driving long cables without
preampliﬁers.
Magnetostriction
Some ferromagnetic materials display a signiﬁcant magnetostrictive strain when subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld.
The effect is analogous in many respects to electrostriction, but the magnetic materials do not have large
remanent magnetization, and thus require a bias ﬁeld or dc current for linear operation. Important
magnetostrictive metals and alloys include nickel and permendur. At one time, magnetostrictive transducers
were used extensively in active sonars but have now been largely replaced by ceramic transducers.
Magnetostrictive transducers are rugged and reliable but inefﬁcient and conﬁgurationally awkward. Certain
rare-earth iron alloys such as terbium–dysprosium–iron (Terfenol-D) possess extremely large magnetostric-
tion (as much as 100 times that of nickel). They have relatively low eddy current losses but require large bias
ﬁelds and have yet to ﬁnd signiﬁcant applications. Gallium–iron alloys (Galfenol) have somewhat less
magnetostriction, but they possess high tensile strength and are machinable. Metallic glasses have also been
considered for magnetostrictive transducers.
Electrodynamic (Moving Coil)
Electrodynamic transducers exploit the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic ﬁeld and,
conversely, the voltage generated by a conductor moving in a magnetic ﬁeld. Moving-coil transducers
dominate the loudspeaker ﬁeld and are the most numerous of all the transducer types. Prototypes of high-
power underwater projectors have been constructed using superconducting magnets. Electrodynamic
microphones, particularly the directional ribbon microphones, are also common.
Electrostatic
Electrostatic sources utilize the force of attraction between charged capacitor plates. The force is
independent of the sign of the voltage, and so a bias voltage is necessary for linear operation. Because the
forces are relatively weak, a large area is needed to obtain signiﬁcant acoustic output. The effect is
reciprocal, with the change in the separation of the plates (i.e., the capacitance) produced by an incident
acoustic pressure generating a voltage. The impedance of a condenser microphone, however, is high, and
so a preampliﬁer located close to the transducer is required. Condenser microphones are frequency-
independent and extremely sensitive. The change in capacitance induced by an acoustic ﬁeld can also be
detected by making the capacitor a part of a bridge circuit or, alternatively, a part of an oscillator circuit.
The acoustic signal will then appear as either an amplitude or frequency modulation of an ac carrier. The
charge storage properties of electrets have been exploited to produce electrostatic microphones that do not
require a maintained bias voltage. Micromachined silicon electrostatic transducers are used as miniature
microphones and accelerometers.

Magnetic (Variable Reluctance)
Magnetic transducers utilize the force of attraction between magnetic poles and, reciprocally, the voltages
produced when the reluctance of a magnetic circuit is changed. They are analogous in many ways to
electrostatic transducers. Magnetic speakers are used in telephone receivers.
Parametric Sources and Receivers
The nonlinear interaction of sound waves can be used to produce highly directional sound sources with no
side lobes and small physical apertures. Despite of their inherent inefﬁciency, useful source levels can be
achieved and such parametric sources have found a number of underwater applications. Parametric receivers
have also been investigated but practical applications have yet to be found.
Carbon Microphones
Carbon microphones utilize a change in electrical resistance with pressure and have been used extensively in
telephones.
Hydraulic
Nonreversible, low-frequency, high-power underwater projectors can be constructed utilizing hydraulic forces
to move large pistons. The piston motion is controlled by modulating the hydraulic pressure with a spool valve
driven by a PZT electromechanical transducer.
Fiber Optic
An acoustic ﬁeld acting on an optical ﬁber will change the optical path length by changing the length and
index of refraction of the ﬁber. Extremely sensitive hydrophones and microphones can be made by using a ﬁber
exposed to an acoustic ﬁeld as one leg of an optical interferometer. Path length changes of the order of 106
optical wavelengths can be detected. The principal advantages of such sensors are their conﬁgurational
ﬂexibility, their sensitivity, and their suitability for use with ﬁber optic cables. Fiber optic sensors which utilize
amplitude modulation of the light (microbend transducers) are also being developed.
24.3
Receiving and Transmitting Responses
A microphone or hydrophone is characterized by its free-ﬁeld voltage sensitivity, M, which is deﬁned (usually
in units of dB re 1 V/mPa) as 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the output voltage, E, to the free-ﬁeld
amplitude of an incident plane acoustic wave. That is, for an incident wave which, in the absence of the
transducer, is given by
P ¼ P0 cosðk · R  otÞ
ð24:1Þ
M is deﬁned by
M ¼ 20 log E=P0


ð24:2Þ
where the wave vector, k, has magnitude o/c and points in the direction of propagation. (Here, o ¼ 2pf is the
angular frequency and c is the speed of sound.) In general, M is a function of frequency and the orientation of
the transducer with respect to k (i.e., the direction of the incident wave). However, for most purposes it is
customary to let M be the sensitivity for an incident wave on the maximum response axis (MRA). M is then a
function of frequency but not orientation, and the directivity is a separate, but equally important,
characteristic that will be discussed in Section ‘‘Directivity’’. It is usually desirable for a microphone or
24-3
Electroacoustic Transducers

hydrophone to have a frequency-independent free-ﬁeld voltage sensitivity over the broadest possible range of
frequencies to assure ﬁdelity of the output electrical signal. For example, for piezoelectric transducers, this
means the frequency range below resonance.
A loudspeaker or projector is characterized in a similar manner by its transmitting current response, S. In
the far ﬁeld of the transducer the acoustic pressure is a spherically spreading wave which can be expressed as
PðRÞ ¼ A0 cosðkRotÞ=R
ð24:3Þ
along the direction of maximum response. The amplitude A0, which is the product of the range R and the
amplitude of the pressure measured at R, characterizes the strength of the acoustic source, whose peak source
level is deﬁned as 20 times the logarithm of A0 (e.g., in units of dB re 1 mPa m). Thus, the transmitting current
response is given (e.g., in units of mPa m/amp) by
S ¼ 20 log A0=I


ð24:4Þ
where I is the amplitude of the driving current and S is a function of the frequency o. For high-ﬁdelity sound
reproduction S should be as ﬂat as possible over the broadest possible bandwidth. For some purposes,
however, such as ultrasonic cleaning or long-range underwater acoustic propagation, ﬁdelity is unnecessary
and high-Q resonant transducers are employed to produce high-intensity sound over a narrow bandwidth.
24.4
Reciprocity
Most conventional transducers are reversible; that is, they can be used as either sources or receivers of sound
(a carbon microphone and a ﬁber optic hydrophone are examples of transducers which are not reversible).
A transducer is said to be linear if the input and output variables are linearly proportional (hot-wire
microphones and unbiased magnetostrictive transducers are examples of nonlinear transducers). A transducer
is said to be passive if the only source of energy is the input electrical or acoustical signal (a microphone with a
built-in preampliﬁer is an example of a nonpassive transducer). Most transducers that are linear, passive, and
reversible exhibit a remarkable property called reciprocity. For a reciprocal transducer of any kind (moving
coil, piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, electrostatic, magnetic, etc.), the free-ﬁeld voltage sensitivity is
proportional to the transmitting current response and is independent of the geometry and construction of
the transducer. That is:
M  S ¼ 20 log JðoÞ
j
j ¼ 20 logð4p=r0oÞ
ð24:5Þ
where J is known as the spherical-wave reciprocity factor, and where r0 is the density of the medium. (It should
be noted that J is often deﬁned as 4pd0/r0o, where d0 is a reference distance, usually equal to 1 m. This factor
is used when S is deﬁned in terms of the pressure extrapolated to 1 m, rather than the pressure–distance
product. Numerically the results are the same, but the dimensions of J and S differ from those presented
above.) Reciprocity has a number of important consequences:
1. The receiving and transmitting beam patterns of a reciprocal transducer are identical.
2. A reciprocal transducer cannot be simultaneously ﬂat as a receiver and transmitter because of the
frequency-dependence of J.
3. Equation (24.5) provides the basis for the three-transducer reciprocity calibration technique whereby an
absolute calibration of a hydrophone or microphone can be obtained from purely electrical
measurements.

24.5
Canonical Equations and Electroacoustic Coupling
Simple electroacoustic transducers can be characterized by a pair of linear equations that relate the four
variables: voltage, E, current, I, velocity of the moving surface, V, and the external force on the surface, F. One
of the most useful of these equation pairs, especially for magnetic transducers where the internal force is
proportional to current, is
E ¼ ZeI þ TemV
ð24:6Þ
F ¼ TmeI þ ZmV
ð24:7Þ
In these equations, Tem and Tme are transduction coefﬁcients, Ze is the blocked (V ¼ 0) electrical impedance,
and Zm is the open-circuit (I ¼ 0) mechanical impedance. For reciprocal transducers Tem ¼ ^Tme. For
example, for an electrodynamic transducer with an axially moving coil in a radial magnetic ﬁeld, B:
Tem ¼ Tme ¼ BL
ð24:8Þ
where L is the length of the wire in the coil.
Transduction coefﬁcients are a measure of electromechanical coupling that are useful for comparing
transducers of the same type. The electromechanical coupling coefﬁcient (or factor), k, is a dimensionless
measure that can be used to compare all types of transducers, because its values are always between zero and
unity. The physical meaning of k2 can be best understood from its deﬁnition as the ratio of converted energy
to total input energy. For example, in a loudspeaker or projector the input energy is electrical and the fraction
of it converted to mechanical energy equals k2. Two speciﬁc examples are:
Moving coil transducer:
k2¼ ðBLÞ2=KE
mLb
ð24:9Þ
where KE
m is the short circuit mechanical stiffness and Lb is the blocked inductance:
Piezoelectric transducer:
k2 ¼ d2
33=eT
33sE
33
ð24:10Þ
where d33 is the piezoelectric strain constant, eT
33 is the permittivity at constant stress, and sE
33 is the short-
circuit compliance coefﬁcient. Note that k2 is a ratio of stored, not dissipated, energies, and so is independent
of the electroacoustic efﬁciency, which is deﬁned as the ratio of output power to total input power. For
example, quartz crystal transducers can be very efﬁcient, but have low coupling, while moving-coil
loudspeakers are usually inefﬁcient devices with high coupling factors.
If a piston transducer is placed in an acoustic ﬁeld such that the average pressure over the surface of the
piston is PB, then F ¼ PB A, where A is the area of the piston. For a receiver I ¼ 0,
E ¼ ðTemA=ZmÞPB
ð24:11Þ
If the transducer is small compared with an acoustic wavelength, PB < P0, and so the free-ﬁeld voltage
sensitivity is given by
M < 20 log TemA=Zm


ð24:12Þ
while the transmitting current response is
S < 20 log r0oTemA=4pZm


ð24:13Þ
24-5
Electroacoustic Transducers

From these simple considerations a number of principles of practical transducer design can be deduced. The
mechanical impedance Zm is in general given by
Zm ¼ Rm þ joM þ Km=jo
ð24:14Þ
where Rm is the mechanical resistance, M the effective mass, and Km an effective spring constant. For a
moving-coil transducer (Equation (24.8)) Tem is independent of frequency; hence from Equation (24.13) we
derive the fundamental tenet of loudspeaker design, that a moving coil loudspeaker will have a ﬂat
transmitting current response above resonance (i.e., where Zm < joM). Accordingly, moving coil loudspeakers
are designed to have the lowest possible resonance frequency (by means of a high compliance since the output
is inversely proportional to the mass). Similarly, it can be shown that an acoustically small condenser
microphone or piezoelectric hydrophone will have a ﬂat free-ﬁeld voltage sensitivity below resonance.
An interesting and important consequence of electromechanical coupling is the effect of the motion of the
transducer on the electrical impedance. In the absence of external forces (F ¼ 0), Equation (24.6) and
Equation (24.7) yield
E ¼ ðZe  TemTme=ZmÞI
ð24:15Þ
That is, the electrical impedance has a ‘‘motional’’ component given by TemTme/Zm. The motional
component can be quite signiﬁcant near resonance where Zm is small. This effect is the basis of crystal-
controlled oscillators.
24.6
Radiation Impedance
An oscillating surface produces a pressure, p, in the medium and a reaction force, FR, on the surface given by
FR ¼
Z Z
pdS ¼ ZRV
ð24:16Þ
where ZR is the radiation impedance. For projector operation, where FR is the only external force, we can thus
rewrite Equation (24.7) as
0 ¼ TmeI þ ðZRþZmÞV
ð24:17Þ
For an acoustically small bafﬂed circular piston of radius a:
ZR¼ pa4r0o2=2c þ jð8=3Þor0a3
ð24:18Þ
The radiation impedance has a mass-like reactance with an equivalent radiation mass of (8/3)r0a3 and a small
resistive component proportional to o2 responsible for the radiated power. A transducer will thus have a lower
resonance frequency when operated underwater than when operated in air or vacuum. The total radiated
power of the piston transducer is given by
p ¼ ReZr V
j j2¼ pa4r0o2=2c


V
j j2
ð24:19Þ
Most transducers are displacement limited, and so for a direct-radiating transducer, V in Equation (24.19) is
limited. To obtain the most output power the piston should have the largest possible surface area.
Alternatively, the driver can be placed at the apex of a horn. For a conical horn, the ﬂuid velocity at the end of
the horn (where the radius is ae) will be reduced to V(a/ae) but the radiating piston will now have an effective
radius of ae so the radiated power will increase by a factor of (ae/a)2. For high-power operation at a single
frequency, the driver can be placed at the end of a quarter-wave resonator.

24.7
Directivity
It is often desirable for transducers to be directional. Directional sound sources are needed in diagnostic and
therapeutic medical ultrasonics, for acoustic depth sounders, and to reduce the power requirements and
reverberation in active sonars, etc. Directional microphones are useful to reduce unwanted noise (e.g., to pick
up the voice of a speaker and not the audience); directional hydrophones or hydrophone arrays increase
signal-to-noise and aid in target localization. The directional characteristics of a transducer are embodied in
the normalized directivity function, D(y; f), which has a value of unity in the direction of maximum
response, i.e., D(0, 0) ¼ 1. The three-dimensional pressure ﬁeld is then expressed as P(R, y, f) ¼ P(R)D(y; f)
with P(R) given by Equation (24.3). The directivity factor, Df, is
Df ¼
4p
R
2p
0
Rp
0
D2ðy; fÞ sinydydf
ð24:20Þ
and the directivity index is
DI ¼ 10 log Df
ð24:21Þ
One way to achieve directionality is to make the radiating surface large. A bafﬂed circular piston has a
directivity function given by
D ¼ 2J1ðka sin yÞ=ðka sin yÞ
ð24:22Þ
where k ¼ o/c. D equals unity for y ¼ 0 and 1/2 when ka sin y ¼ 2.2. For small values of ka, D is near unity for
all angles.
Some transducers respond to the gradient of the acoustic pressure rather than pressure, for example, the
ribbon microphone which works by detecting the motion of a thin conducting strip orthogonal to a magnetic
ﬁeld. Such transducers have a directivity function which is dipole in nature, i.e.:
D ¼ cos y
ð24:23Þ
Note that a ribbon microphone will have ﬂat receiving sensitivity when its impedance is mass controlled. By
combining a dipole receiver with a monopole receiver one obtains a unidirectional cardioid receiver with
D ¼ ð1 þ cos yÞ=2
ð24:24Þ

Introduction
Piezoelectric materials have been used extensively in resonator, actuator, and ultrasonic receiver applications,
while ferroelectric materials have recently received much attention for their potential use in nonvolatile (NV)
memory applications. We will discuss the basic concepts in the use of these materials, highlight their applications,
and describe the constraints limiting their uses. This chapter emphasizes properties which need to be understood
for the effective use of these materials. Among the properties discussed are hysteresis and domains.
Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials derive their properties from a combination of structural and
electrical properties. As the name implies, both types of materials have electric attributes. A large number of
materials, which are ferroelectric, are also piezoelectric. However, the converse is not true. Pyroelectricity is
closely related to ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties via the symmetry properties of the crystals.
Examples of the classes of materials that are technologically important are given in Table 25.1. It is apparent
that many materials exhibit electric phenomena which can be attributed to ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and
electret properties. It is also clear that vastly different materials (organic and inorganic) can exhibit
ferroelectricity or piezoelectricity, and many have actually been commercially exploited for these properties.
As shown in Table 25.1, there are two dominant classes of bulk ferroelectric materials: ceramics and
organics. Both classes have important applications of their piezoelectric properties. To exploit the ferroelectric
property for memory applications, recently a large effort has been devoted to producing thin ﬁlms of the
ceramic PZT (lead [Pb] zirconate titanate) on various substrates for silicon-based memory chips for
nonvolatile storage. In these devices, data is retained in the absence of external power as positive and negative
polarization. Other applications of thin ﬁlms are resonators and surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices for
signal ﬁltering and the use of the nonlinear properties for phase shifters on electrically steered antennas.
Organic materials have not been used for their ferroelectric properties. Liquid crystals in display applications
are used for their ability to rotate the plane of polarization of light and not their ferroelectric attribute.
It should be noted that the preﬁx ferro refers to the permanent nature of the electric polarization in analogy
with the magnetization in the magnetic case. It does not imply the presence of iron, even though the root of
the word means iron. The root of the word piezo means pressure; hence the original meaning of the word
25-1

piezoelectric implied ‘‘pressure electricity’’—the generation of an electric ﬁeld from applied pressure. This
deﬁnition ignores the fact that these materials are reversible, allowing the generation of mechanical motion by
applying a ﬁeld.
25.2
Mechanical Characteristics
When materials are acted on by forces (stresses) the resulting deformations are called strains. An example of a
strain due to a force to the material is the change of dimension parallel and perpendicular to the applied force.
It is useful to introduce the coordinate system and the numbering conventions, which are used when
discussing these materials. Subscripts 1, 2, and 3 refer to the x, y, and z directions, respectively. Displacements
have single indices associated with their direction. If the material has a preferred axis, such as the poling
direction in PZT, the axis is designated the z or 3 axis. Stresses and strains require double indices such as xx or
xy. To make the notation less cluttered and confusing, contracted notation has been deﬁned. The following
mnemonic rule is used to reduce the double index to a single index:
1
6
5
xx
xy
xz
2
4
yy
yz
3
zz
This rule can be thought of as a matrix with the diagonal elements having repeated indices in the expected
order, then continuing the count in a counterclockwise direction. Note that xy ¼ yx, etc., so that subscript 6
applies equally to xy and yx.
Any mechanical object is governed by the well-known relationship between stress and strain:
S ¼ sT
ð25:1Þ
where S is the strain (relative elongation), T is the stress (force per unit area), and s contains the coefﬁcients
connecting the two. All quantities are tensors; S and T are second rank, and s is fourth rank. Note, however,
that usually contracted notation is used so that the full complement of subscripts is not visible. PZT converts
electrical ﬁelds into mechanical displacements and vice versa. The connection between the two is via the d and
g coefﬁcients. The d coefﬁcients give the displacement when a ﬁeld is applied (transmitter), while the g
coefﬁcients give the ﬁeld across the device when a stress is applied (receiver). The electrical effects are added to

Note that T and E are shown as column vectors for typographical reasons; they are in fact row vectors. This
equation shows explicitly the stress-strain relation and the effect of the electromechanical conversion.
A similar equation applies when the material is used as a receiver:
E ¼ gT þ ðeeeeeTÞ1D
ð25:4Þ
where eeeeeT is the transpose of eeeee and D the electric displacement. The matrices are not fully populated for all
materials. Whether a coefﬁcient is nonzero depends on the crystalline symmetry. For PZT, a ceramic which is
given a preferred direction by the poling operation (the z axis), only d33, d13, and d15 are nonzero. Also, again
by symmetry, d13 ¼ d23 and d15 ¼ d25.
Applications
Historically the material which was used earliest for its piezoelectric properties was single-crystal quartz. Sonar
devices were built by Langevin using quartz transducers, but the most important application of piezoelectric
quartz was, and still is, frequency control. Crystal oscillators are today at the heart of every clock that does not
derive its frequency reference from the ac power line. They are also used in every color television set and
personal computer. In these applications, at least one (or more) quartz crystals controls frequency or time.
This explains the label ‘‘quartz’’ appearing on many clocks and watches. The use of quartz resonators for
frequency control relies on another unique property. Not only is the material piezoelectric (which allows one
to excite mechanical vibrations), but the material has also a very high mechanical ‘‘Q’’ or quality factor (Q
4100,000). The actual value depends on the mounting details, whether the crystal is in a vacuum, and other
details. Compare this value to a Q for PZT between 65 and 1000. The Q factor is a measure of the rate of decay

and thus the mechanical losses of an excitation with no external drive. A high Q leads to a very sharp
resonance and thus tight frequency control. For frequency control it has been possible to ﬁnd orientations of
cuts of quartz, which reduce the inﬂuence of temperature on the vibration frequency.
Ceramic materials of the PZT family have also found increasingly important applications. The piezoelectric
but not the ferroelectric property of these materials is made use of in transducer applications. PZT has a very
high efﬁciency (electric energy to mechanical energy coupling factor k) and can generate high-amplitude
ultrasonic waves in water or solids. The coupling factor is deﬁned by
k2 ¼ energy stored mechanically
total energy stored
ð25:5Þ
Typical values of k33 are 0.7 for PZT 4 and 0.09 for quartz, showing that PZT is a much more efﬁcient
transducer material than quartz. Note that the energy is a scalar; the subscripts are assigned by ﬁnding the
energy conversion coefﬁcient for a speciﬁc vibrational mode and ﬁeld direction, and selecting the subscripts
accordingly. Thus, k33 refers to the coupling factor for a longitudinal mode driven by a longitudinal ﬁeld.
Probably the most important applications of PZT today are based on ultrasonic echo ranging. Sonar uses
the conversion of electrical signals to mechanical displacement as well as the reverse transducer property,
which is to generate electrical signals in response to a stress wave. Medical diagnostic ultrasound, sonar, and
nondestructive testing systems devices rely on the same properties. Actuators have also been built but a major
obstacle is the small displacement which can conveniently be generated. Even then, the required voltages are
typically hundreds of volts and the displacements are only a few hundred angstroms. For PZT the strain in the
z-direction due to an applied ﬁeld in the z-direction is (no stress, T ¼ 0):
s3 ¼ d33E3
ð25:6Þ
or
s3 ¼ Dd
d ¼ d33
V
d
ð25:7Þ
where s is the strain, E the electric ﬁeld, and V the potential; d33 is the coupling coefﬁcient which connects the
two. Thus:
Dd ¼ d33V
ð25:8Þ
Note that this expression is independent of the thickness d of the material but this is true only when the
applied ﬁeld is parallel to the displacement. Let the applied voltage be 100 V and let us use PZT8 for which d33
is 225 (from Table 25.2). Hence, Dd ¼ 225 A˚ or 2.25 A˚ /V, a small displacement indeed. We also note that
Equation (25.6) is a special case of Equation (25.2) with the stress equal to zero. This is the situation when an
actuator is used in a force-free environment, for example, as a mirror driver. This arrangement results in the
maximum displacement. Any forces which tend to oppose the free motion of the PZT will subtract from the
available displacement with the reduction given by the normal stress–strain relation (Equation (25.1)).
It is possible to obtain larger displacements with mechanisms that exhibit mechanical gain, such as
laminated strips (bimorph, similar to bimetallic strips). The motion then is typically up to about 1 mm, but at
a cost of a reduced available force. An example of such an application is the video head translating device to
provide tracking in VCRs.
There is another class of ceramic bulk materials which recently has become important. PMN
(Pb, magnesium niobate, typically doped with <10% lead titanate) is an electrostrictive material which
has seen applications where the absence of hysteresis is important. For example, deformable mirrors require
repositioning of the reﬂecting surface to a deﬁned location regardless of whether the old position was above or
below the original position.

Electrostrictive materials exhibit a strain which is quadratic as a function of the applied ﬁeld. Producing a
displacement requires an internal polarization. Because the latter polarization is induced by the applied ﬁeld
and is not permanent, as it is in the ferroelectric materials, electrostrictive materials have essentially no
hysteresis. Unlike PZT, electrostrictive materials are not reversible; PZT will change shape on application of an
electric potential and generate an electric ﬁeld when a strain is induced. Electrostrictive materials only change
shape on application of a ﬁeld and, therefore, cannot be used as receivers. PZT has inherently large hysteresis
because of the domain nature of the polarization.
Organic electrets have important applications in self-polarized condenser (or capacitor) microphones where
the required electric bias ﬁeld in the gap is generated by the diaphragm material rather than by an external
power supply.
Structure of Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials
Ferroelectric materials have, as their basic building block, atomic groups which have an associated electric
ﬁeld, either as a result of their structure or as result of distortion of the charge clouds making up the groups.
In the ﬁrst case, the ﬁeld arises from an asymmetric placement of the individual ions in the group (these
groupings are called unit cells). In the second case, the electronic cloud is moved with respect to the ionic core.
If the group is distorted permanently, then a permanent electric ﬁeld can be associated with each group. We
can think of these distorted groups as represented by electric dipoles, deﬁned as two equal but opposite
charges, which are separated by a small distance. Electric dipoles are similar to magnetic dipoles which have
the familiar north and south poles. The external manifestation of a magnetic dipole is a magnetic ﬁeld and
that of an electric dipole is an electric ﬁeld.
Figure 25.1(a) represents a hypothetical slab of material in which the dipoles are perfectly arranged.
In actual materials the atoms are not as uniformly arranged, but, nevertheless, from this model there would be
a very strong ﬁeld emanating from the surface of the crystal. The common observation, however, is that the
ﬁelds are either absent or weak. This effective charge neutrality arises from the fact that there are free, mobile
charges available, which can be attracted to the surfaces. The polarity of the mobile charges is opposite to the
charge of the free dipole end. The added charges on the two surfaces generate their own ﬁeld, equal and
opposite to the ﬁeld due to the internal dipoles. Thus the effect of the internal ﬁeld is canceled and the external
ﬁeld is zero, as if no charges were present at all (Figure 25.1(b)). This name given to this phenomenon is
charge compensation.
In ferroelectric materials a crystalline asymmetry exists, which allows electric dipoles to form. In their
absence the dipoles are absent and the internal ﬁeld disappears. Consider an imaginary horizontal line drawn
through the middle of a dipole. We can see readily that the dipole is not symmetric about that line. The
asymmetry thus requires that there be no center of inversion when the material is in the ferroelectric state.
All ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials have phase transitions at which the material changes crystalline
symmetry. For example, in PZT there is a change from tetragonal or rhombohedral symmetry to cubic as the
FIGURE 25.1

arrays.
25-5
Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials

temperature is increased. The temperature at which the material changes crystalline phases is called the Curie
temperature, TY. For typical PZT compositions the Curie temperature is between 250 and 450–C. This
temperature is affected by composition and doping.
A consequence of a phase transition is that a rearrangement of the lattice takes place when the material is
cooled through the transition. Intuitively we would expect that the entire crystal assumes the same orientation
throughout as we pass through the transition. By orientation we mean the direction of the preferred axis (say
the tetragonal axis). Experimentally it is found, however, that the material breaks up into smaller regions in
which the preferred direction, and thus the polarization, is uniform. Note that cubic materials have no
preferred direction. In tetragonal crystals the polarization points along the c axis (the longer axis) whereas in
rhombohedral lattices the polarization is along the body diagonal. The volume in which the preferred axis is
pointing in the same direction is called a domain and the boundary between the regions is called a domain
wall. The energy of the multidomain state is slightly lower than the single-domain state and is thus the
preferred conﬁguration. The direction of the polarization changes by either 90– or 180– as we pass from one
uniform region to another. Thus the domains are called 90– and 180– domains. Whether an individual
crystallite or grain consists of a single domain depends on the size of the crystallite and external parameters
such as strain gradients, impurities, etc. It is also possible that a domain extends beyond the grain boundary
and encompasses two or more grains of the crystal.
Real materials consist of large numbers of unit cells, and the manifestation of the individual charged groups
is an internal and an external electric ﬁeld when the material is stressed. Internal and external refer to inside
and outside of the material. The interaction of an external electric ﬁeld with a charged group causes a
displacement of certain atoms in the group. The macroscopic manifestation of this is a displacement of the
surfaces of the material. This motion is called the piezoelectric effect, the conversion of an applied ﬁeld into a
corresponding displacement.
25.3
Ferroelectric Materials
PZT ðPbZrxTið1xÞO3Þ is an example of a ceramic material which is ferroelectric. We will use PZT as a
prototype system for many of the ferroelectric attributes to be discussed. The concepts, of course, have general
validity. The structure of this material is ABO3 where A is lead and B is one or the other atoms, Ti or Zr. This
material consists of many randomly oriented crystallites which vary in size between approximately 10 nm and
several microns depending on the details of the preparation. The crystalline symmetry of the material is
determined by the magnitude of the parameter x. The material changes from rhombohedral to tetragonal
symmetry when x 4 0.48. This transition is almost independent of temperature. The line that divides the two
phases is called a morphotropic phase boundary (change of symmetry as a function of composition only).
Commercial materials are made with x < 0.48, where the d and g sensitivity of the material is maximum. It is
clear from Table 25.2 that there are other parameters which can be inﬂuenced as well. Doping the material
with donors or acceptors often changes the properties dramatically. Thus, niobium is important to obtain
higher sensitivity and resistivity, and to lower the Curie temperature. As the Curie temperature is lowered the g
and d coefﬁcients increase making the material more sensitive. The tradeoff is the increased temperature
dependence of the parameters.
PZT typically is a p-type conductor and niobium will signiﬁcantly decrease the conductivity because of the
electron which Nb5þ contributes to the lattice. The Nb ion substitutes for the B-site ion Ti4þ or Zr4þ. The
resistance to depolarization (the ‘‘hardness’’ of the material) is affected by iron doping. Hardness is a
deﬁnition giving the relative resistance to depolarization. It should not be confused with mechanical hardness.
Many other dopants and admixtures have been used, often in very exotic combinations to affect aging,
sensitivity, etc.
The designations used in Table 25.2 reﬂect very few of the many combinations which have been developed.
The PZT designation types were originally designed by the U.S. Navy to reﬂect certain property combinations.
The property types can be obtained with different combinations of compositions and dopants. The examples
given in the table are representative of typical PZT materials, but today essentially all applications have their
25-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

own custom formulation. The name PZT has become generic for the lead zirconate titanates and does not
reﬂect Navy or proprietary designations.
When PZT ceramic material is prepared, the crystallites and domains are randomly oriented, and therefore
the material does not exhibit any piezoelectric behavior; (see Figure 25.2(a)). The random nature of the
displacements for the individual crystallites causes the net displacement to average to zero when an external
ﬁeld is applied. The tetragonal axis has three equivalent directions 90– apart and the material can be poled by
reorienting the polarization of the domains into a direction nearest to the applied ﬁeld. When a sufﬁciently
high ﬁeld is applied, some but not all of the domains will be rotated toward the electric ﬁeld through the
allowed angle 90– or 180–. If the ﬁeld is raised further, eventually all domains will be oriented as close as
possible to the direction of the ﬁeld. Note however, that the polarization will not point exactly in the direction
of the ﬁeld (Figure 25.2(b)). At this point, no further domain motion is possible and the material is saturated.
As the ﬁeld is reduced, the majority of domains retain the orientation they had with the ﬁeld on leaving the
material in an oriented state which now has a net polarization. Poling is accomplished for commercial PZT by
raising the temperature to about 150–C in oil (which has the effect of lowering the coercive ﬁeld, Ec) and
applying a ﬁeld of about 30 to 60 kV/cm for several minutes. The temperature is then lowered, but it is not
necessary to keep the ﬁeld on during cooling because the domains will not spontaneously rerandomize.
Electrical Characteristics
Before considering the dielectric properties, we will consider the equivalent circuit for a slab of ferroelectric
material. In Figure 25.3 the circuit shows a mechanical (acoustic) component and the static or clamped
capacity Co (and the dielectric loss Rd), which are connected in parallel. The acoustic components are due to
their motional or mechanical equivalents, the compliance (capacity, C), and the mass (inductance, L). There
will be mechanical losses which are indicated in the mechanical branch by RM. The electrical branch has the
clamped capacity Co and a dielectric loss (Rd) distinct from the mechanical losses. This conﬁguration will have
a resonance which is usually assumed to correspond to the mechanical thickness mode but can represent other
FIGURE 25.2

shown on the right.

Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials

modes as well. This simple model does not show the many other modes a slab (or rod) of material will have.
Thus, transverse, plate, and ﬂexural modes are present. Each can be represented by its own combination of L,
C, and RM. The presence of a large number of modes often causes difﬁculties in characterizing the material
since some parameters must be measured either away from the resonances or from clean, nonoverlapping
resonances. For instance, the clamped capacity (or clamped dielectric constant) of a material is measured at
high frequencies where there are usually a large number of modes present. For an accurate measurement these
must be avoided and often a low-frequency measurement is made, in which the material is physically clamped
to prevent motion. This yields the static, nonmechanical capacity, Co. The circuit can be approximated at low
frequencies by ignoring the inductor, and redeﬁning R and C. Thus, the coupling constant can be extracted
from the value of C and Co. From the previous deﬁnition of k (Equation (25.5)) we ﬁnd:
k2 ¼

It requires a charge to rotate or ﬂip a domain. Thus, there is charge ﬂow associated with the rearrangement of
the polarization in the ferroelectric material. If a slow bipolar signal is applied to a ferroelectric material, its
hysteresis loop is traced out and the charge in the circuit can be measured using the Sawyer Tower circuit
(Figure 25.4). In some cases, the drive signal to the material is not repetitive and only a single cycle is used.
In that case the starting point and the end point do not have the same polarization value because of relaxation
effects and the hysteresis curve will not close on itself.
The charge ﬂow through the sample is due to the rearrangement of the polarization vectors in the domains
(the polarization) and contributions from the static capacity and losses (Co and Rd in Figure 25.3). The charge
is integrated by the measuring capacitor which is in series with the sample. The measuring capacitor is
sufﬁciently large to avoid a signiﬁcant voltage loss. The polarization is plotted on an X–Y scope or plotter
against the applied voltage and therefore the applied ﬁeld.
Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials are lossy. This will distort the shape of the hysteresis loop and can
even lead to incorrect identiﬁcation of materials as ferroelectric when they merely have nonlinear conduction
characteristics. A resistive component (from Rd in Figure 25.3) will introduce a phase shift in the polarization
signal. Thus, the display has an elliptical component, which looks like the beginning of the opening of a
hysteresis loop. However, if the horizontal signal has the same phase shift, the inﬂuence of this lossy
component is eliminated because it is in effect subtracted. Obtaining the exact match is the function of the
optional phase shifter, and in the original Sawyer Tower circuit a bridge was constructed, which had a second
measuring capacitor in the comparison arm (identical to the one in series with the sample). The phase was
then matched with adjustable high-voltage components matching Co and Rd.

This design is inconvenient to implement and modern hysteresis loopers have the capability to shift the
reference phase either electronically or digitally to compensate for the loss and static components.
A contemporary version, which has compensation and no voltage loss across the integrating capacitor, is
shown in Figure 25.5. The op-amp integrator provides a virtual ground at the input, reducing the voltage loss
to negligible values. The output from this circuit is the sum of the polarization and the capacitive and loss
components. These contributions can be canceled using a purely real (resistive) and a purely imaginary
(capacitive, 90– phaseshift) compensation component proportional to the drive across the sample. Both need
to be scaled (magnitude adjustments) to match them to the device being measured and then have to be
subtracted (adding negatively) from the output of the op amp. The remainder is the polarization.
The hysteresis for typical ferroelectrics is frequency dependent and traditionally the reported values of
the polarization are measured at 50 or 60 Hz.
The improved, digital version of the Sawyer Tower circuit allows the cancellation of Co and Rd and the
losses, thus determining the ferroelectrically active component. A representative plot with compensation is
shown in Figure 25.6. The ability to separate the contributions is important in the development of materials
for ferroelectric or piezoelectric applications. It is far easier to judge the shape and squareness of the loop when
the inactive components are cancelled. Also, by calibrating the ‘‘magnitude controls’’, the value of the inactive
components can be read off directly. In typical measurements, the resonance is far above the test frequency
used, so ignoring the inductance in the equivalent circuit is justiﬁed. There are commercial testers on the
market; examples are: the Precision LC2 by Radiant Technologies (U.S.) and the TF Analyzer 20002 by
aixACCT (Germany). The latter has specialized adapter heads for various thin ﬁlm measurements. Newer
instruments now also have the capability to make measurements at higher frequencies, which is important for
memory devices.
The measurement of the dielectric constant and the losses is usually very straightforward. A slab with a
circular or other well-deﬁned cross section is prepared, electrodes are applied, and the capacity and loss are
measured (usually as a function of frequency). The dielectric constant is found from
C ¼ eoe A
t
ð25:10Þ
where A is the area of the device and t the thickness. In this deﬁnition (also used in Table 25.2), e is the relative
dielectric constant and eo is the permittivity of vacuum. Until recently, the dielectric constant, like the
polarization, was measured at 50 or 60 Hz (typical powerline frequencies) primarily due to instrumentation
constraints. Today the dielectric parameters are typically speciﬁed at 1 kHz, which is possible because

compensation are included schematically and are digital in contemporary testers.

Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials

impedance analyzers with high-frequency capability are readily available. Even higher frequencies such as
1 MHz are often used when evaluating PZT thin ﬁlms.
Low-frequency anomalies caused by interface layers are not included in the equivalent circuit (Figure 25.3).
These layers will cause both the resistive and reactive components to increase at low frequencies producing
readings which are not representative of the intrinsic dielectric properties.
A piezoelectric component often has a very simple geometric shape, especially when it is prepared for
measurement purposes. There will be mechanical resonances associated with the major dimensions of a
sample piece. The resonance spectrum will be more or less complicated, depending on the shape of a sample
piece. If the object has a simple shape, then some of the resonances will be well separated from each other and
can be associated with speciﬁc vibrations and dimensions (modes). Each of these resonances has an electrical
equivalent, and inspection of the equivalent circuit shows that there will be a resonance (minimum
impedance) and an antiresonance (maximum impedance). Thus, an impedance plot can be used to determine
the frequencies and also the coupling constants and mechanical parameters for the various modes.
25.4
Ferroelectric and High Epsilon Thin Films
While PZT and other ferroelectric (FE) bulk materials have had major commercial importance, thin ﬁlms
prepared from these materials have only recently been the focus of signiﬁcant research efforts. In this section
the material properties and process issues will be discussed. Because of the potentially large payoff, major
efforts have been directed at developing the technologies for depositing thin ﬁlms of ferroelectric and
nonferroelectric but high epsilon (high dielectric constant) thin ﬁlms.
A recent trend has been the ever increasing density of dynamic random access memory (DRAM).
The storage capacitor in these devices is becoming a major limiting factor because the dielectric has to be very
thin in order to achieve the desired capacitance values to yield, in turn, a sufﬁcient signal for the storage cell. It
is often also desirable to have nonvolatile operation (no data loss on power loss). These two desires have,
probably more than anything else, driven the development of high epsilon and FE thin ﬁlms. Of course, these
are not the only applications of FE ﬁlms. Table 25.3 lists the applications of FE (nonvolatile, NV) and high
epsilon ﬁlms (volatile), and highlights which of the properties are important for their use. It is seen that the

memory application is very demanding. Satisfying all these requirements simultaneously has produced
signiﬁcant challenges in the manufacture of these ﬁlms. At the present time (2004) some progress has been
made in producing nonvolatile memory devices using perovskites such as PZT but the devices are for niche
applications such as smart cards. The true mass application, as a memory element in computers large or small,
has not come to pass. In this arena ﬂash memory is still the dominant technology.
There has been a success in the acoustic application of piezoelectric materials for bandpass ﬁlters in the
form of a mechanical ﬁlter called FBAR (ﬁlm bulk acoustic resonator). This is a ﬁlter device for cell phones etc.,
operating typically at 2.4 GHz. Traditional LC ﬁlters are bulky and have low Q at these frequencies. The FBAR
is small and has good band shape characteristics. Interestingly the transducer is made of AlN, a piezoelectric
material which has not seen signiﬁcant other applications. This material has the desirable property of a high
velocity of sound, which eases some of the scaling issues. In passing we note that other group III nitrides are
also piezoelectric, but have lower coupling factors. The other desirable property is that the material itself is
very compatible with silicon wafer processing, unlike PZT.
Perhaps the least understood and to some extent still unsolved problem is that of fatigue. In nonvolatile
memory applications the polarization represents the memory state of the material (positive  bit 1; negative 
bit 0). In use the device can be switched at the clock rate, say 100 MHz. Thus, for a lifetime of ﬁve years, the
material must withstand ^1016 polarization reversals or large ﬁeld reversals. Typical materials for ferroelectric
memory applications are PZTs with the ratio of zirconium to titanium adjusted to yield the maximum
dielectric constant and polarization. This maximum will be near the morphotropic phase boundary for PZT.
Small quantities of other materials can be added, such as lanthanum or niobium to modify optical or
switching characteristics. The Sol-Gel method discussed below is particularly suitable for incorporating these
additives. Devices made from materials at the current state-of-the-art lose a signiﬁcant portion of their
polarization after 1010 to 1012 cycles, rendering them useless for their intended memory use because of the
associated signal loss. This is a topic of intensive investigation and no superior material besides PZT material
has emerged which might be suitable for memory use.
High epsilon nonferroelectric materials are of great interest for DRAM applications. As an example, major
efforts are extant to produce thin ﬁlms of mixtures of barium and strontium titanate (BST). Dielectric
constants of 600 and above have been achieved (compared to 4 to 6 for silicon oxides and nitrides).
In applications for FE ﬁlms, signiﬁcant opportunities also exist for electro-optical modulators for ﬁber-
optic devices and light valves for displays. Another large scale application is actuators and sensors. For the
latter the electro-mechanical conversion property is used and large values of d33 (the conversion coefﬁcient)
are desirable. A highly desirable application of ﬁeld dependent dielectric properties is being currently
investigated. Steerable array antennas and tunable devices thus become feasible if suitable materials and
conﬁgurations can be found. However, economically the importance of all other applications is and probably
will be in the foreseeable future, less signiﬁcant than that of memory devices.
Integration of ferroelectric or nonferroelectric materials with silicon devices and substrates has proved to be
very challenging. Contacts and control of the crystallinity and crystal size, and the stack structure of the

Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials

capacitor device are the principal issues. In both volatile and nonvolatile memory cells the dielectric material
tends to interact with the silicon substrate. Thus an appropriate barrier layer must be incorporated while at the
same time obtaining a suitable substrate on which to grow the dielectric ﬁlms. A typical device structure starts
with an oxide layer (SiOx) on the silicon substrate followed by a thin titanium layer which prevents diffusion
of the ﬁnal substrate and contact layer, e.g., platinum (the actual growth substrate).
Signiﬁcant differences have been observed in the quality of the ﬁlms depending on the nature of the
substrate. The quality can be described by intrinsic parameters such as the crystallinity (i.e., the degree to
which noncrystalline phases are present). The uniformity of the orientation of the crystallites also seems to
play a role in determining the electrical properties of the ﬁlms. In the extreme case of perfect alignment of the
crystallites of the ﬁlm and the formation of large single crystal areas, an epitaxial ﬁlm is obtained. These ﬁlms
tend to have the best electrical properties. In addition to amorphous material, other crystalline but
nonferroelectric phases can be present. One example is the pyrochlore phase in PZT. These phases often form
incidentally to the growth process of the desired ﬁlm and usually degrade one or more of the desired
properties of the ﬁlm (for instance the dielectric constant). The pyrochlore and other oxide materials can
accumulate between the electrode and the desired PZT or BST layer. The interface layer is then electrically in
series with the desired dielectric layer and degrades its properties. The apparent reduction of the dielectric
constant which is often observed in these ﬁlms as the thickness is reduced can be attributed to the presence of
these low dielectric constant layers.
There are many growth methods for these ﬁlms. Table 25.4 lists the most important techniques along with
some of the critical parameters. Wet methods use metal organic compounds in liquid form. In the Sol-Gel
process the liquid is spun on to the substrate. The wafer is then heated, typically to a lower, intermediate
temperature (around 300–C). This spin-on and heat process is repeated until the desired thickness is reached.
At this temperature only an amorphous ﬁlm forms. The wafer is then heated to between 500 and 700–C,
usually in oxygen, and the actual crystal growth takes place. Instead of simple long term heating (order of
hours) rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is also used. In this process the sample is only brieﬂy exposed to the
elevated temperature, usually by a scanning infrared beam. It is in the transition between the low
decomposition temperature and the ﬁring temperature that the pyrochlore tends to form. At the higher
temperatures the more volatile components have a tendency to evaporate, thus producing a chemically
unbalanced compound which also has a great propensity to form one or more of the pyrochlore phases. In the
case of PZT, 5 to 10% excess lead is usually incorporated, which helps to form the desired perovskite material
and compensates for the loss. In preparing Sol-Gel ﬁlms it is generally easy to prepare the compatible liquid
compounds of the major constituents and the dopants. The composition is then readily adjusted by
appropriately changing the ratio of the constituents. Very ﬁne quality ﬁlms have been prepared by this
method, including epitaxial ﬁlms.
The current semiconductor technology is tending toward dry processing. Thus, despite of the advantages of
the Sol-Gel method, other methods using physical vapor deposition (PVD) are being investigated. These
methods use energetic beams or plasma to move the constituent materials from the target to the heated
substrate. The compound then forms in situ on the heated wafer (^500–C). Even then, however, a subsequent
anneal is typically required. With PVD methods it is much more difﬁcult to change the composition since now

the oxide or metal ratios of the target have to be changed or dopants have to be added. This involves the
fabrication of a new target for each composition ratio. MOCVD is an exception here; the ratio is adjusted by
regulating the carrier gas ﬂow. However, the equipment is very expensive and the processing temperatures tend
to be high (up to 800–C, uncomfortably high for semiconductor device processing). The laser sputtering
method is very attractive and it has produced very ﬁne ﬁlms. The disadvantage is that the ﬁlms are deﬁned by
the plume which forms when the laser beam is directed at the source. This produces only small areas of good
ﬁlms and scanning methods need to be developed to cover full size silicon wafers. Debris is also a signiﬁcant
issue in laser deposition. However, it is a convenient method to produce ﬁlms quickly and with a small
investment. In the long run MOCVD or Sol-Gel will probably evolve as the method of choice for realistic
DRAM or FRAM devices with state-of-the-art densities.

Coercive ﬁeld:
When a ferroelectric material is cycled through the hysteresis loop the coercive ﬁeld is the

ﬁeld, and these are usually, but not always, equal in magnitude to each other.

In crystalline materials the constituent atoms are arranged in regular geometric ways; for
instance in the cubic phase the atoms occupy the corners of a cube (edge dimensions <2 to 15 A˚ for
typical oxides).
Curie temperature:
The temperature at which a material spontaneously changes its crystalline phase or
symmetry. Ferroelectric materials are often cubic above the Curie temperature and tetragonal or
rhombohedral below.
Domain:
Domains are portions of a material in which the polarization is uniform in magnitude and
direction. A domain can be smaller, larger, or equal in size to a crystalline grain.
Electret:
A material which is similar to ferroelectrics but in which charges are macroscopically separated and
thus are not structural. In some cases the net charge in the electrets is not zero, for instance when an
implantation process was used to embed the charge.
Electrostriction:
The change in size of a nonpolarized, dielectric material when it is placed in an electric
ﬁeld.
Ferroelectric:
A material with permanent charge dipoles which arise from asymmetries in the crystal
structure. The electric ﬁeld due to these dipoles can be observed external to the material when certain
conditions are satisﬁed (ordered material and no charge on the surfaces).
Hysteresis:
When the electric ﬁeld is raised across a ferroelectric material the polarization lags behind. When
the ﬁeld is cycled across the material the hysteresis loop is traced out by the polarization.
Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB):
Materials which have a MPB assume a different crystalline phase
depending on the composition of the material. The MPB is sharp (a few percent in composition) and
separates the phases of a material. It is approximately independent of temperature in PZT.
Piezoelectric:
A material which exhibits an external electric ﬁeld when a stress is applied to the material and
a charge ﬂow proportional to the strain is observed when a closed circuit is attached to electrodes on the
surface of the material.
PLZT:
A PZT material with a lanthanum doping or admixture (up to approximately 15% concentration).
The lanthanum occupies the A-site.
PMN:
Generic name for electrostrictive materials of the lead (Pb) magnesium niobate family.
Polarization:
The polarization is the amount of charge associated with the dipolar or free charge in a
ferroelectric or an electret, respectively. For dipoles the direction of the polarization is the direction of
the dipole. The polarization is equal to the external charge which must be supplied to the material to
produce a polarized state from a random state (twice that amount is necessary to reverse the
25-13
Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials

polarization). The statement is rigorously true if all movable charges in the material are reoriented
(i.e., if complete saturation can be achieved).
PVF2:
An organic polymer which can be ferroelectric. The name is an abbreviation for polyvinyledene
diﬂuoride.
PZT:
Generic name for piezoelectric materials of the lead (Pb) zirconate (Zr) titanate (Ti) family.
Remanent polarization:
The residual or remanent polarization of a material after an applied ﬁeld is reduced
to zero. If the material was saturated, the remanent value is usually referred to as the polarization,
although even at smaller ﬁelds a (smaller) polarization remains.

Introduction
Electrostriction is the basic electromechanical coupling mechanism in centric crystals and amorphous solids. It
has been recognized as the primary electromechanical coupling in centric materials since early in the twentieth
century (Cady, 1929). Electrostriction is the quadratic coupling between the strain developed in a material and
the electric ﬁeld applied, and it exists in all insulating materials. Piezoelectricity is a better-known linear
coupling mechanism that exists only in materials without a center of symmetry.
Electrostriction is a second-order property that is tunable and nonlinear. Electrostrictive materials exhibit a
reproducible, nonhysteretic, and tunable strain response to electric ﬁelds, which gives them an advantage over
piezoelectrics in micropositioning applications. While most electrostrictive actuator materials are perovskite
ceramics, recently there has been much interest in large electrostriction effects in such polymer materials as
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) and its copolymer with triﬂuoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) (Zhang et al., 1998).
This chapter discusses the three electrostrictive effects and their applications. A discussion of the sizes of
these effects and typical electrostrictive coefﬁcients is followed by an examination of lead magnesium niobate
(PMN) as a prototype electrostrictive material. The electromechanical properties of some common
electrostrictive materials are also compared. A few common criteria used to select relaxor ferroelectrics for
electrostrictive applications are also outlined.
26.2
Deﬁning Equations
Electrostriction is deﬁned as the quadratic coupling between strain (x) and electric ﬁeld (E), or between strain
and polarization (P). It is a fourth-rank tensor deﬁned by the following relationship:
xij ¼ Mijmn Em En
ð26:1Þ
where xij is the strain tensor, Em and En components of the electric ﬁeld vector, and Mijmn the fourth-rank
ﬁeld-related electrostriction tensor. The M coefﬁcients are deﬁned in units of m2/V2.
Ferroelectrics and related materials often exhibit nonlinear dielectric properties with changing electric ﬁelds.
To better express the quadratic nature of electrostriction, it is useful to deﬁne a polarization-related
26-1

electrostriction coefﬁcient Qijmn, as
xij ¼ Qijmn Pm Pn
ð26:2Þ
Q coefﬁcients are deﬁned in units of m4/C2. The M and Q coefﬁcients are equivalent. Conversions between the
two coefﬁcients are carried out using the ﬁeld-polarization relationships:
Pm ¼ Zmn En;
and
En ¼ wmn Pm
ð26:3Þ
where Zmn is the dielectric susceptibility tensor and wmn is the inverse dielectric susceptibility tensor.
Electrostriction is not a simple phenomenon but manifests itself as three thermodynamically related effects
(Newnham et al., 1997). The ﬁrst is the well-known variation of strain with polarization, called the direct
effect d2xij/dEkdEl ¼ Mijkl). The second is the stress (Xkl) dependence of the dielectric stiffness wmn, or the
reciprocal dielectric susceptibility, called the ﬁrst converse effect (dwmn/dXkl ¼ Mmnkl). The third effect is
the polarization dependence of the piezoelectric voltage coefﬁcient gjkl, called the second converse effect
(dgjkl/dPi ¼ wmkwnlMijmn). These effects are of importance because they offer independent and equivalent
techniques for electrostriction measurements, which include the strain gage, the capacitance dilatometer, and
the laser interferometer (Yimnirun et al., 2002, 2003).
Piezoelectricity and Electrostriction
Piezoelectricity is a third-rank tensor property found only in acentric materials and is absent in most
materials. The noncentrosymmetric point groups generally exhibit piezoelectric effects that are larger than the
electrostrictive effects and obscure them. The electrostriction coefﬁcients Mijkl or Qijkl constitute fourth-rank
tensors which, like the elastic constants, are found in all insulating materials, regardless of symmetry.
Electrostriction is the origin of piezoelectricity in ferroelectric materials, in both conventional ceramic
ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3 as well as in organic polymer ferroelectrics such as PVDF copolymers (Furukawa
and Seo, 1990). In a ferroelectric material that exhibits both spontaneous and induced polarizations, P s
i and P0
1,
the strains arising from spontaneous polarizations, piezoelectricity, and electrostriction may be formulated as
xij ¼ QijklPs
kPs
l þ 2QijklPs
kP0
l þ QijklP0
kP0
l
ð26:4Þ
In the paraelectric state, we may express the strain as xij ¼ QijklPkPl, so that dxij/dPk ¼ gijk ¼ 2QijklPl.
Converting to the commonly used dijk coefﬁcients:
dijk ¼ wmk gijm ¼ 2wmkQijmnPn
ð26:5Þ
This origin of piezoelectricity in electrostriction provides us an avenue into nonlinearity. In this case, it is the
ability to tune the piezoelectric coefﬁcient and the dielectric behavior of a transducer. The piezoelectric
coefﬁcient varies with the polarization induced in the material, and may be controlled by an applied electric
ﬁeld. The electrostrictive element may be tuned from an inactive to a highly active state. The electrical
impedance of the element may be tuned by exploiting the dependence of permittivity on the biasing ﬁeld for
these materials, and the saturation of polarization under high ﬁelds (Newnham, 1990).
Electrostriction and Compliance Matrices
The fourth-rank electrostriction tensor is similar to the elastic compliance tensor, but is not identical.
Compliance is a more symmetric fourth-rank tensor than is electrostriction. For compliance, in the most
general case:
sijkl ¼ sjikl ¼ sijlk ¼ sjilk ¼ sklij ¼ slkij ¼ sklji ¼ slkij
ð26:6Þ
26-2
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

but for electrostriction
Mijkl ¼ Mjikl ¼ Mijlk ¼ Mjilk 6¼ Mklij ¼ Mlkij ¼ Mklji ¼ Mlkij
ð26:7Þ
This means that for most point groups the number of independent electrostriction coefﬁcients exceeds those
for elasticity. M and Q coefﬁcients may also be deﬁned in a matrix (Voigt) notation. The electrostriction and
elastic compliance matrices for point groups 6/mmm and 1/mm are compared below:

Compliance coefﬁcients s13 and s31 are equal, but M13 and M31 are not. The difference arises from an energy
argument which requires the elastic constant matrix to be symmetric.
It is possible to deﬁne sixth-rank and higher-order electrostriction coupling coefﬁcients. The electrostriction
tensor can also be treated as a complex quantity, similar to the dielectric and the piezoelectric tensors. The
imaginary part of the electrostriction is also a fourth-rank tensor. Our discussion is conﬁned to the real part of
the quadratic electrostriction tensor.
Magnitudes and Signs of Electrostrictive Coefﬁcients
The values of M coefﬁcients range from about 1024 m2/V2 in low-permittivity materials to 1016 m2/V2 in
high-permittivity actuator materials made from relaxor ferroelectrics such as PMN–lead titanate (PMN–PT)
compositions. Large strains of the order of strains in ferroelectric piezoelectric materials such as lead zirconate
titanate (PZT) may be induced in these materials. Q values vary in an opposite way to M values. Q ranges
from 103 m4/C2 in relaxor ferroelectrics to greater than 1 m4/C2 in low-permittivity materials. Since the
strain is directly proportional to the square of the induced polarization, it is also proportional to the square of
the dielectric permittivity. This implies that materials with large dielectric permittivities, like relaxor
ferroelectrics, can produce large strains despite having small Q coefﬁcients.
As a consequence of the quadratic nature of the electrostriction effect, the sign of the strain produced in the
material is independent of the polarity of the ﬁeld. This is in contrast with linear piezoelectricity where
reversing the direction of the ﬁeld causes a change in the sign of the strain. The sign of the electrostrictive
strain depends only on the sign of the electrostriction coefﬁcient. In most oxide ceramics, the longitudinal
electrostriction coefﬁcients are positive. The transverse coefﬁcients are negative as expected from Poisson ratio
effects. Another consequence is that electrostrictive strain occurs at twice the frequency of an applied ac ﬁeld.
In acentric materials, where both piezoelectric and electrostrictive strains may be observed, this fact is very
useful in separating the strains arising from piezoelectricity and from electrostriction.
26.3
PMN–PT: A Prototype Electrostrictive Material
Most commercial applications of electrostriction involve high-permittivity materials such as relaxor
ferroelectrics. PMN (Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3) relaxor ferroelectric compounds were ﬁrst synthesized more than
40 years ago. Since then, the PMN system has been well characterized in both single-crystal and ceramic
forms, and may be considered the prototype ferroelectric electrostrictor (Jang et al., 1980). Lead titanate
(PbTiO3, PT) and other materials are commonly added to PMN to shift Tmax or increase the maximum
dielectric constant. The addition of PT to PMN gives rise to a range of compositions, the PMN–PT system,
that have a higher Curie range and superior electromechanical coupling coefﬁcients. The addition of other
26-3
Electrostriction

oxide compounds, mostly other ferroelectrics, is a widely used method to tailor the electromechanical
properties of electrostrictors (Voss et al., 1983). Some properties of the PMN–PT system are presented here.
Based on dielectric constant vs. temperature plots, the electromechanical behavior of a relaxor ferroelectric
may be divided into three regimes (Figure 26.1). At temperatures less than Td, the depolarization temperature,
the relaxor material is macropolar, exhibits a stable remanent polarization, and behaves as a piezoelectric.
Tmax is the temperature at which the maximum dielectric constant is observed. Between Td and Tmax, the
material possesses nanometer-scale microdomains that strongly inﬂuence the electromechanical behavior.
Large dielectric permittivities and large electrostrictive strains arising from micro-macrodomain reorientation
are observed. Above Tmax, the material is a ‘‘true electrostrictor’’ in that it is paraelectric and exhibits
nonhysteretic, quadratic strain-ﬁeld behavior. Since macroscale domains are absent, no remanent strain is
observed. Improved reproducibility in strain and low-loss behavior are achieved.
Figure 26.2 illustrates the quadratic dependence of the transverse strain on the induced polarization for
ceramic 0.9PMN–0.1PT. Figure 26.3(a) and (b) show the longitudinal strain as a function of the applied

electric ﬁeld for the same composition. The strain-ﬁeld plots are not quadratic, and illustrate essentially
anhysteretic nature of electrostrictive strain. The transverse strain is negative, as expected.
The averaged longitudinal and transverse electrostriction coefﬁcients have been measured for poled ceramic
PMN to be Q33 , 2.3 · 102 m4/C2, Q13 , 0.64 · 102 m4/C2. The corresponding ﬁeld-related coefﬁcients
are M33 , 1.50 · 1016 m2/V2 and M13 , 4.19 · 1017 m2/V2. Induced strains of the order of 104 may be
achieved with moderate electric ﬁelds of ,40 kV/cm. These strains are much larger than thermal expansion
strains, and are in fact equivalent to thermal expansion strains induced by a temperature change of ,1000–C.
M33 values for some other common ferroelectrics, P(VDF–TrFE) copolymers, and nonferroelectric low-
permittivity dielectrics are listed in Table 26.1.
The mechanical quality factor QM for PMN is 8100 (at a ﬁeld of ,200 kV/m) compared with 300 for poled
barium titanate or 75 for poled PZT 5-A (Nomura and Uchino, 1983) The induced piezoelectric coefﬁcients
d33 and d31 can vary with ﬁeld (Figure 26.4). The maxima in the induced piezoelectric coefﬁcients for PMN as
a function of biasing electric ﬁeld are at E , 1.2 MV/m, with d33 ¼ 240 pC/N and d31 ¼ 72 pC/N.
Pb(Mg0.3Nb0.6Ti0.1)O3 is a very active composition, with a maximum d33 ¼ 1300 pC/N at a biasing ﬁeld
of 3.7 kV/cm.

Applications
The advantages that electrostrictors have over other actuator materials include low hysteresis of the strain-ﬁeld
response, no remanent strain (walk off), reduced aging and creep effects, a high response speed (510 msec),
and strain values (40.03%) achievable at realizable electric ﬁelds. Displacement ranges of several tens of
microns may be achieved with ^0.01 m reproducibility. Most actuator applications of electrostrictors as
servotransducers and micropositioning devices take advantage of these characteristics (Uchino, 1986).
In selecting electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectrics for actuator and sensor applications, the following criteria
are commonly used. A large dielectric constant and ﬁeld stability in the K vs. E relations are useful in achieving
large electrostrictive strains. These criteria also lead to large induced polarizations and large induced
piezoelectric coefﬁcients through the second converse effect.
Broad dielectric transitions allow for a large operating temperature range. In the case of relaxors, this
implies a large difference between Tmax and Td. Minimal E–P hysteresis and no remanent polarization are
useful in achieving a low-loss material that is not susceptible to joule heating effects. These factors are listed in
Table 26.2.

Mechanical applications range from stacked actuators through inchworms, microangle adjusting devices,
and oil pressure servovalves (Uchino, 1996). Multilayer actuators produce large displacements and high forces
at low drive voltages. The linear change in capacitance with applied stress of an electrostrictor can be used as a
capacitive stress gauge. Electrostrictors may also be used in ﬁeld-tunable piezoelectric transducers (Sundar and
Newnham, 1992). Recently, electrostrictive materials have been integrated into ultrasonic motors and novel
ﬂextensional transducers (Uchino, 1996; Meyer et al., 2001). Electrostrictors have also been integrated into
‘‘smart’’ optical systems such as bistable optical devices, interferometric dilatometers, and deformable mirrors.
Electrostrictive correction of optical aberrations is a signiﬁcant tool in active optics. Electrostrictors also ﬁnd
applications in ‘‘very smart’’ systems such as sensor-actuator active vibration-suppression elements (Uchino
and Giniewicz, 2003). A shape memory effect arising from inverse hysteretic behavior (Meyer and Newnham,
2000) and electrostriction in PZT family antiferroelectrics is also of interest (Uchino, 1985).
26.5
Summary
Electrostriction is a fundamental electromechanical coupling effect. In ceramics with large dielectric constants
and in some polymers, large electrostrictive strains may be induced that are comparable in magnitude with
piezoelectric strains in actuator materials such as PZT. The converse electrostrictive effect, which is the change
in dielectric susceptibility with applied stress, facilitates the use of the electrostrictor as a stress gauge. The
second converse effect may be used to tune the piezoelectric coefﬁcients of the material as a function of the
applied ﬁeld. Electrostrictive materials offer tunable nonlinear properties that are suitable for application in
very smart systems.

Introduction
The Hall effect is a phenomenon that arises when an electric current and magnetic ﬁeld are simultaneously
imposed on a conducting material. Speciﬁcally, in a ﬂat plate conductor, if a current density, Jx, is applied in
the x direction and (a component of) a magnetic ﬁeld, Bz, in the z direction, then the resulting electric ﬁeld,
Ey, transverse to Jx and Bz is known as the Hall electric ﬁeld EH (see Figure 27.1) and is given by
Ey ¼ RJxBz
ð27:1Þ
where R is known as the Hall coefﬁcient. The Hall coefﬁcient can be related to the electronic structure and
properties of the conduction bands in metals and semiconductors and historically has probably been the most
important single parameter in the characterization of the latter. Some authors choose to discuss the Hall effect
in terms of the Hall angle, f, shown in Figure 27.1, which is the angle between the net electric ﬁeld and the
imposed current. Thus,
tan f ¼ EH=Ex
ð27:2Þ
For the vast majority of Hall effect studies that have been carried out, the origin of EH is the Lorentz force, FL,
that is exerted on a charged particle as it moves in a magnetic ﬁeld. For an electron of charge e with velocity v,
FL is proportional to the vector product of v and B; that is:
FL ¼ e v x B
ð27:3Þ
In these circumstances a semiclassical description of the phenomenon is usually adequate. This description
combines the classical Boltzmann transport equation with the Fermi–Dirac distribution function for the
charge carriers (electrons or holes) (Ziman, 1960), and this is the point of view that will be taken in this
chapter. Examples of Hall effect that cannot be treated semiclassically are the spontaneous (or extraordinary)
Hall effect that occurs in ferromagnetic conductors (Berger and Bergmann, 1980), the quantum Hall effect
(Prange and Girvin, 1990), and the Hall effect that arises in conjuction with hopping conductivity
(Emin, 1977).
27-1

In addition to its use as an important tool in the study of the nature of electrically conducting materials, the
Hall effect has a number of direct practical applications. For example, the sensor in some commercial devices
for measuring the magnitude and orientation of magnetic ﬁelds is a Hall sensor. The spontaneous Hall effect
has been used as a nondestructive method for exploring the presence of defects in steel structures. The
quantum Hall effect has been used to reﬁne our knowledge of the magnitudes of certain fundamental
constants such as the ratio of e2/h where h is Planck’s constant.
27.2
Theoretical Background
The Boltzmann equation for an electron gas in a homogeneous, isothermal material that is subject to constant
electric and magnetic ﬁelds is (Ziman, 1960):

ð27:4Þ
Here, k is the quantum mechanical wave vector, " is Planck’s constant divided by 2p, t is the time, f is the
electron distribution function, and s is meant to indicate that the time derivative of f is a consequence of
scattering of the electrons. In static equilibrium (E ¼ 0, B ¼ 0) f is equal to f0 and f0 is the Fermi–Dirac
distribution function:
f0 ¼

ð27:5Þ
where E(k) is the energy, z is the chemical potential, K is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. Each
term in Equation (27.4) represents a time rate of change of f and in dynamic equilibrium their sum has to be
zero. The last term represents the effect of collisions of the electrons with any obstructions to their free
movement such as lattice vibrations, crystallographic imperfections, and impurities. These collisions are
usually assumed to be representable by a relaxation time, t(k); that is:

where f – f0 is written as (qf0=qeÞg(k), which is essentially the ﬁrst term in an expansion of the deviation of f
from its equilibrium value, f0. Equation (27.6) and Equation (27.4) can be combined to give

The Hall electric ﬁeld EH ¼ Ey in this geometry arises because of the Lorentz force on the conducting charges and is
of just such a magnitude that in combination with the Lorentz force there is no net current in the y direction. The
angle f between the current and net electric ﬁeld is called the Hall angle.

If Equation (27.7) can be solved for g(k), then expressions can be obtained for both the EH and the
magnetoresistance (the electrical resistance in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld). Solutions can in fact be
developed that are linear in the applied electric ﬁeld (the regime where Ohm’s law holds) for two physical
situations: (i) when oct551 (Hurd, 1972, p. 69) and (ii) when oct441 (Lifshitz et al., 1956; Hurd, 1972)
where oc ¼ Be/m is the cyclotron frequency. Situation (ii) means the electron is able to complete many
cyclotron orbits under the inﬂuence of B in the time between scatterings and is called the high (magnetic) ﬁeld
limit. Conversely, situation (i) is obtained when the electron is scattered in a short time compared to the time
necessary to complete one cyclotron orbit and is known as the low ﬁeld limit. In effect, the solution to
Equation (27.7) is obtained by expanding g(k) in a power series in oct or 1/oct for (i) and (ii), respectively.
Given g(k) the current vector, Jl (l ¼ x,y,z) can be calculated from (Blatt, 1957):
Jl ¼


 Z
vlðkÞgðkÞðqf0=qEÞd3k
ð27:8Þ
where vl(k) is the velocity of the electron with wave vector k. Every term in the series deﬁning Jl is linear in
the applied electric ﬁeld, E, so that the conductivity tensor slm is readily obtained from Jl ¼ slmEm (Hurd, 1972,
p. 9). This matrix equation can be inverted to give El ¼ rlm Jm. For the same geometry used in deﬁning
Equation (27.1):
Ey ¼ EH ¼ ryxJx
ð27:9Þ
where r21 is a component of the resistivity tensor sometimes called the Hall resistivity. Comparing Equation
(27.1) and Equation (27.9) it is clear that the B dependence of EH is contained in r12. However, nothing in the
derivation of r12 excludes the possibility of terms to the second or higher powers in B. Although these are
usually small, this is one of the reasons that experimentally one usually obtains R from the measured transverse
voltage by reversing magnetic ﬁelds and averaging the measured EH by calculating (1/2)[EH(B) – EH(–B)].
This eliminates the second-order term in B and in fact all even power terms contributing to the EH. Using the
Onsager relation (Smith and Jensen, 1989, p. 60) r12(B) ¼ r21(–B), it is also easy to show that in terms of
the Hall resistivity:
R ¼ 1

B ½r12ðBÞ þ r21ðBÞ	
ð27:10Þ
Strictly speaking, in a single crystal the electric ﬁeld resulting from an applied electric current and magnetic
ﬁeld, both of arbitrary direction relative to crystal axes and each other, cannot be fully described in terms of a
second-order resistivity tensor (Hurd, 1972, p. 71). However, Equation (27.1), Equation (27.9), and Equation
(27.10) do deﬁne the Hall coefﬁcient in terms of a second-order resistivity tensor for a polycrystalline
(assumed isotropic) sample or for a cubic single crystal or for a lower symmetry crystal when the applied ﬁelds
are oriented along major symmetry directions. In real-world applications the Hall effect is always treated in
this manner.
27.3
Relation to the Electronic Structure––(i) ooctt << 1
General expressions for R in terms of the parameters that describe the electronic structure can be obtained
using Equation (27.7) to Equation (27.10) and have been given by Blatt (1957) for the case of crystals having
cubic symmetry. An even more general treatment has been given by McClure(1956). Here, the discussion of
speciﬁc results will be restricted to the free electron model wherein the material is assumed to have one or
more conducting bands, each of which has a quadratic dispersion relationship connecting E and k; that is:
Ei ¼ "2k2
i
2mi
ð27:11Þ
27-3
The Hall Effect

where the subscript speciﬁes the band number and mi, the effective mass for each band. These masses need
not be equal nor the same as the free electron mass. In effect, some of the features lost in the free electron
approximation are recovered by allowing the masses to vary. The relaxation times, ti, will also be taken to be
isotropic (not k dependent) within each band but can be different from band to band. Although extreme, these
approximations are often qualitatively correct, particularly in polycrystalline materials, which are macro-
scopically isotropic. Further, in semiconductors these results will be strictly applicable only if ti is energy
independent as well as isotropic.
For a single spherical band, RH is a direct measure of the number of current carriers and turns out to be
given by (Blatt, 1957):
RH ¼ 1
ne
ð27:12Þ
where n is the number of conduction carriers/volume. RH depends on the sign of the charge of the current
carriers being negative for electrons and positive for holes. This identiﬁcation of the carrier sign is itself a
matter of great importance, particularly in semiconductor physics. If more than one band is involved in
electrical conduction, then by imposing the boundary condition required for the geometry of Figure 27.1 that
the total current in the y direction from all bands must vanish, Jy ¼ 0, it is easy to show that (Wilson, 1958):
RH ¼ ð1=sÞ2P½s2
i Ri	
ð27:13Þ
where Ri and si are the Hall coefﬁcient and electrical conductivity, respectively, for the ith band (si ¼ nie2ti/mi),
s ¼ Ssi is the total conductivity of the material, and the summation is taken over all bands. Using Equation
(27.12), Equation (27.13) can also be written:
RH ¼

ð27:14Þ
where neff is the effective or apparent number of electrons determined by a Hall effect experiment. (Note that
some workers prefer representing Equation (27.13) and Equation (27.14) in terms of the current carrier
mobility for each band, mi, deﬁned by si ¼ niemi.)
The most commonly used version of Equation (27.14) is the so-called two-band model, which assumes that
there are two spherical bands with one composed of electrons and the other of holes. Equation (27.14) then
takes the form:
RH ¼ 1

ð27:15Þ
From Equation (27.14) or Equation (27.15) it is clear that the Hall effect is dominated by the most highly
conducting band. Although for fundamental reasons it is often the case that ne ¼ nh (a so-called compensated
material), RH would rarely vanish since the conductivities of the two bands would rarely be identical. It is also
clear from any of Equation (27.12), Equation (27.14), or Equation (27.15) that, in general, the Hall effect in
semiconductors will be orders of magnitude larger than that in metals.
27.4
Relation to the Electronic Structure––(ii) ooctt >> 1
The high ﬁeld limit can be achieved in metals only in pure, crystalographically well-ordered materials and at
low temperatures, which circumstances limit the electron scattering rate from impurities, crystallographic
imperfections, and lattice vibrations, respectively. In semiconductors, the much longer relaxation time and
smaller effective mass of the electrons makes it much easier to achieve the high ﬁeld limit. In this limit the
result analogous to Equation (27.15) is (Blatt, 1968, p. 290):

ð27:16Þ
Note that the individual band conductivities do not enter in Equation (27.16). Equation (27.16) is valid
provided the cyclotron orbits of the electrons are closed for the particular direction of B used. It is not
necessary that the bands be spherical or the t0s isotropic. Also, for more than two bands RH depends only on
the net difference between the number of electrons and the number of holes. For the case where ne ¼ nh, in
general, the lowest order dependence of the Hall electric ﬁeld on B is B2 and there is no simple relationship of
RH to the number of current carriers. For the special case of the two-band model, however, RH is a constant
and is of the same form as Equation (27.15) (Fawcett, 1964).
Metals can have geometrically complicated Fermi surfaces wherein the Fermi surface contacts the Brillouin
zone boundary as well as encloses the center of the zone. This leads to the possibility of open electron orbits in
place of the closed cyclotron orbits for certain orientations of B. In these circumstances R can have a variety of
dependencies on the magnitude of B and in single crystals will generally be dependent on the exact orientation
of B relative to the crystalline axes (Fawcett, 1964; Hurd, 1972, p. 51). R will not, however, have any simple
relationship to the number of current carriers in the material.
Semiconductors have too few electrons to have open orbits but can manifest complicated behavior of their
Hall coefﬁcient as a function of the magnitude of B. This occurs because of the relative ease with which one can
pass from the low ﬁeld limit to the high ﬁeld limit and even on to the so-called quantum limit with currently
attainable magnetic ﬁelds. (The latter has not been discussed here.) In general, these different regimes of B will
not occur at the same magnitude of B for all the bands in a given semiconductor, further complicating the
dependence of R on B.
Deﬁning Terms
Conducting band:
The band in which the electrons primarily responsible for the electric current are found.
Effective mass:
An electron in a lattice responds differently to applied ﬁelds than would a free electron or a
classical particle. One can, however, often describe a particular response using classical equations by
deﬁning an effective mass whose value differs from the actual mass. For the same material the effective
mass may be different for different phenomena; e.g., electrical conductivity and cyclotron resonance.
Electron band:
A range or band of energies in which there is a continuum (rather than a discrete set as in,
for example, the hydrogen atom) of allowed quantum mechanical states partially or fully occupied by
electrons. It is the continuous nature of these states that permits them to respond almost classically to an
applied electric ﬁeld.
Hole or hole state:
When a conducting band, which can hold two electrons/unit cell, is more than half full,
the remaining unﬁlled states are called holes. Such a band responds to electric and magnetic ﬁelds as if it
contained positively charged carriers equal in number to the number of holes in the band.
Relaxation time:
The time for a distribution of particles, out of equilibrium by a measure F, to return
exponentially toward equilibrium to a measure F/e out of equilibrium when the disequilibrating ﬁelds
are removed (e is the natural logarithm base).

Introduction
The fundamental ideal behind all of a superconductor’s unique properties is that superconductivity is a
quantum mechanical phenomenon on a macroscopic scale created when the motions of individual electrons
are correlated. According to the theory developed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer (BCS
theory), this correlation takes place when two electrons couple to form a Cooper pair. For our purposes, we
may therefore consider the electrical charge carriers in a superconductor to be Cooper pairs (or more
colloquially, superelectrons) with a mass m* and charge q* twice those of normal electrons. The average
distance between the two electrons in a Cooper pair is known as the coherence length, x. Both the coherence
length and the binding energy of two electrons in a Cooper pair, 2D, depend upon the particular
superconducting material. Typically, the coherence length is many times larger than the interatomic spacing of
a solid, and so we should not think of Cooper pairs as tightly bound electron molecules. Instead, there are
many other electrons between those of a speciﬁc Cooper pair allowing for the paired electrons to change
partners on a time scale of h/(2D), where h is Planck’s constant.
If we prevent the Cooper pairs from forming by ensuring that all the electrons are at an energy greater than
the binding energy, we can destroy the superconducting phenomenon. This can be accomplished, for example,
with thermal energy. In fact, according to the BCS theory, the critical temperature, Tc, associated with this
energy is
2D
kBTc
< 3:5
ð28:1Þ
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant. For low critical temperature (conventional) superconductors, 2D is typically
on the order of 1 meV, and we see that these materials must be kept below temperatures of about 10 K to
exhibit their unique behavior. Superconductors with high critical temperature, in contrast, will superconduct
up to temperatures of about 100 K, which is attractive from a practical view because the materials can be
cooled cheaply using liquid nitrogen. A second way of increasing the energy of the electrons is electrically
driving them. In other words, if the critical current density, Jc, of a superconductor is exceeded, the electrons
have sufﬁcient kinetic energy to prevent the formation of Cooper pairs. The necessary kinetic energy can also
be generated through the induced currents created by an external magnetic ﬁeld. As a result, if a superconductor
is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld larger than its critical ﬁeld, Hc, it will return to its normal metallic state.
28-1

To summarize, superconductors must be maintained under the appropriate temperature, electrical current
density, and magnetic ﬁeld conditions to exhibit their special properties. An example of this phase space is shown
in Figure 28.1.
28.2
General Electromagnetic Properties
The hallmark electromagnetic properties of a superconductor are its ability to carry a static current without
any resistance and its ability to exclude a static magnetic ﬂux from its interior. It is this second property,
known as the Meissner effect that distinguishes a superconductor from merely being a perfect conductor
(which conserves the magnetic ﬂux in its interior). Although superconductivity is a manifestly quantum
mechanical phenomenon, a useful classical model can be constructed around these two properties. In this
section we outline the rationale for this classical model, which is useful in engineering applications such as
waveguides and high-ﬁeld magnets.
The zero’s dc resistance criterion implies that the superelectrons move unimpeded. The electromagnetic
energy density, w, stored in a superconductor is therefore:
w ¼ 1
2 eE2 þ 1
2 moH2 þ n*
2 m*v2
s
ð28:2Þ
where the ﬁrst two terms are the familiar electric and magnetic energy densities, respectively. (Our
electromagnetic notation is standard: e is the permittivity, mo is the permeability, E is the electric ﬁeld, and the
magnetic ﬂux density, B, is related to the magnetic ﬁeld, H, via the constitutive law B ¼ mo H.) The last term
represents the kinetic energy associated with the undamped superelectrons’ motion (n* and vs are the
superelectrons’ density and velocity, respectively). Because the supercurrent density, Js, is related to the
superelectron velocity by Js ¼ n*q*vs, the kinetic energy term can be rewritten:

Assuming that all the charge carriers are superelectrons, there is no power dissipation inside the
superconductor, and so Poynting’s theorem over a volume V may be written:

ð28:5Þ
where the left side of the expression is the power ﬂowing into the region. By taking the time derivative of the
energy density and appealing to Faraday’s and Ampe`re’s laws to ﬁnd the time derivatives of the ﬁeld quantities,
we ﬁnd that the only way for Poynting’s theorem to be satisﬁed is if
E ¼ q
qt ðLJsÞ
ð28:6Þ
This relation, known as the ﬁrst London equation (after the London brothers, Heinz and Fritz), is thus
necessary if the superelectrons have no resistance to their motion.
Equation (28.6) also reveals that the superelectrons’ inertia creates a lag between their motion and that of
the electric ﬁeld. As a result, a superconductor can support a time-varying voltage drop across itself. The
impedance associated with the supercurrent, therefore, is an inductor, and it will be useful to think of L as an
inductance created by the correlated motion of the superelectrons.
If the ﬁrst London equation is substituted into Faraday’s law, H · E ¼ (qB=qt), and integrated with
respect to time, the second London equation results:
H · ðLJsÞ ¼ B
ð28:7Þ
where the constant of integration has been deﬁned to be zero. This choice is made so that the second London
equation is consistent with the Meissner effect, as we now demonstrate. Taking the curl of the quasistatic form
of Ampe`re’s law, H · H ¼ Js, results in the expression H2B ¼ moH · Js, where a vector identity, H · H · C ¼
H (H·C)H2C; the constitutive relation, B ¼ mo H; and Gauss’s law, H·B ¼ 0, have been used. By now appealing
to the second London equation, we obtain the vector Helmholtz equation:

ð28:9Þ
From Equation (28.8) we ﬁnd that a ﬂux density applied parallel to the surface of a semiinﬁnite
superconductor will decay away exponentially from the surface on a spatial length scale of order l. In other
words, a bulk superconductor will exclude an applied ﬂux as predicted by the Meissner effect.
The London equations reveal that there is a characteristic length l over which electromagnetic ﬁelds can
change inside a superconductor. This penetration depth is different from the more familiar skin depth of
electromagnetic theory, the latter being a frequency-dependent quantity. Indeed, the penetration depth at zero
temperature is a distinct material property of a particular superconductor.
28-3
Superconductivity

Notice that l is sensitive to the number of correlated electrons (the superelectrons) in the material. As
previously discussed, this number is a function of temperature, and so only at T ¼ 0 do all the electrons that
usually conduct ohmically participate in the Cooper pairing. For intermediate temperatures, 04T4Tc, there
are actually two sets of interpenetrating electron ﬂuids: the uncorrelated electrons providing ohmic
conduction and the correlated ones creating supercurrents. This two-ﬂuid model is a useful way to build
temperature effects into the London relations.
Under the two-ﬂuid model, the electrical current density, J, is carried by both the uncorrelated (normal)
electrons and the superelectrons: J ¼ JnþJs, where Jn is the normal current density. The two channels are
modeled in a circuit, as shown in Figure 28.2, by a parallel combination of a resistor (representing the ohmic
channel) and an inductor (representing the superconducting channel). To a good approximation, the
respective temperature dependences of the conductor and inductor are

where so is the dc conductance of the normal channel. (Strictly speaking, the normal channel should
also contain an inductance representing the inertia of the normal electrons, but typically such an
inductor contributes negligibly to the overall electrical response.) Since the temperature-dependent penetra-
tion depth is deﬁned as l(T) ¼

Most of the important physics associated with the classical model is embedded in Equation (28.12). As is clear
from the lumped element model, the relative importance of the normal and superconducting channels is a
function not only of temperature but also of frequency. The familiar L/R time constant, here equal to L~sso,
delineates the frequency regimes where most of the total current is carried by Jn (if oL~sso >> 1) or Js
(if oL~sso551). This same result can also be obtained by comparing the skin depth associated with the normal

Superconductivity

28.3
Superconducting Electronics
The macroscopic quantum nature of superconductivity can be usefully exploited to create a new type of
electronic device. Because all the superelectrons exhibit correlated motion, the usual wave-particle duality
normally associated with a single quantum particle can now be applied to the entire ensemble of
superelectrons. Thus, there is a spatiotemporal phase associated with the ensemble that characterizes the
supercurrent ﬂowing in the material.
Naturally, if the overall electron correlation is broken, this phase is lost and the material is no longer a
superconductor. There is a broad class of structures, however, known as weak links, where the correlation is
merely perturbed locally in space rather than outright destroyed. Colloquially, we say that the phase ‘‘slips’’
across the weak link to acknowledge the perturbation.
The unusual properties of this phase slippage were ﬁrst investigated by Brian Josephson and constitute the
central principles behind superconducting electronics. Josephson found that the phase slippage could be
deﬁned as the difference between the macroscopic phases on either side of the weak link. This phase difference,
denoted as f, determined the supercurrent, is, through voltage, v, across the weak link according to the
Josephson equations:
is ¼ Ic sin f
ð28:14Þ
v ¼ Fo
2p

ð28:15Þ
where Ic is the critical (maximum) current of the junction and Fo is the quantum unit ofﬂux. (The ﬂux quantum
has a precise deﬁnition in terms of Planck’s constant, h, and the electron charge, e: Fo  h/(2e) < 2.068 · 1015
Wb). As in the previous section, the correlated motion of the electrons, here represented by the superelectron
phase, manifests itself through an inductance. This is straightforwardly demonstrated by taking the time
derivative of Equation (28.14) and combining this expression with Equation (28.15). Although the resulting
inductance is nonlinear (it depends on cos f), its relative scale is determined by
Lj ¼ Fo

ð28:16Þ
a useful quantity for making engineering estimates.
A common weak link, known as the Josephson tunnel junction, is made by separating two superconducting
ﬁlms with a very thin (typically 20 A˚ ) insulating layer. Such a structure is conveniently analyzed using the
resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model shown in Figure 28.3. Under the RCSJ model, an
FIGURE 28.3

ideal lumped junction (described by Equation (28.14) and Equation (28.15)) and a resistor Rj represent how
the weak link structure inﬂuences the respective phases of the super and normal electrons, and a capacitor Cj
represents the physical capacitance of the sandwich structure. If the ideal lumped junction portion of the
circuit is treated as an inductor-like element, many Josephson tunnel junction properties can be calculated
with the familiar circuit time constants associated with the model. For example, the quality factor Q of the
RCSJ circuit can be expressed as
Q2 ¼ RjCj
Lj=Rj
¼ 2pIcR2
j Cj
Fo
 b
ð28:17Þ
where b is known as the Stewart–McCumber parameter. Clearly, if b >> 1, the ideal lumped junction element
is underdamped in that the capacitor readily charges up, dominates the overall response of the circuit, and
therefore creates a hysteretic i–v curve as shown in Figure 28.4(a). In the case when the bias current is raised
from zero, no time-averaged voltage is created until the critical current is exceeded. At this point the junction
switches to the voltage 2D/e with a time constant
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
LjCj
p
. Once the junction has latched into the voltage state,
however, the bias current must be lowered to zero before it can again be steered through the superconducting
path. Conversely, b << 1 implies that the Lj/Rj time constant dominates the circuit response, so that the
capacitor does not charge up and the i–v curve is not hysteretic (Figure 28.4(b)).
Just as the correlated motion of the superelectrons creates the frequency-independent Meissner effect in a
bulk superconductor through Faraday’s law, so too the macroscopic quantum nature of superconductivity
allows the possibility of a device whose output voltage is a function of a static magnetic ﬁeld. If two weak links
are connected in parallel, the lumped version of Faraday’s law gives the voltage across the second weak link as
v2 ¼ v1 + (dF/dt), where F is the total ﬂux threading the loop between the links. Substituting Equation
(28.15) and integrating with respect to time yields
f2  f1 ¼ ð2p FÞ=Fo
ð28:18Þ
showing that the spatial change in the phase of the macroscopic wavefunction is proportional to the local
magnetic ﬂux. The structure described is known as a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
and can be used as a highly sensitive magnetometer by biasing it with current and measuring the resulting
voltage as a function of magnetic ﬂux. Such SQUID structures have also been proposed for quantum bits in
quantum computing. From this discussion, it is apparent that a duality exists in how ﬁelds interact with the

macroscopic phase: electric ﬁelds are coupled to its rate of change in time, and magnetic ﬁelds are coupled to
its rate of change in space.
28.4
Types of Superconductors
The macroscopic quantum nature of superconductivity also affects the general electromagnetic properties
previously discussed. This is most clearly illustrated by the interplay of the characteristic lengths x,
representing the scale of quantum correlations, and l, representing the scale of electromagnetic screening.
Consider the scenario where a magnetic ﬁeld, H, is applied parallel to the surface of a semiinﬁnite
superconductor. The correlations of the electrons in the superconductor must lower the overall energy of
the system or else the material would not be superconducting in the ﬁrst place. Because the critical
magnetic ﬁeld Hc destroys all the correlations, it is convenient to deﬁne the energy density gained by the
system in the superconducting state as ð1=2ÞmoH2
c. The electrons in a Cooper pair are separated on a
length scale of x however, the correlations cannot be fully achieved until a distance roughly x from the
boundary of the superconductor. There is thus an energy per unit area, ð1=2ÞmoH2
cx, that is lost because
of the presence of the boundary. Now consider the effects of the applied magnetic ﬁeld on this system. It
costs the superconductor energy to maintain the Meissner effect, B ¼ 0, in its bulk; in fact, the energy
density required is ð1=2ÞmoH2. However, since the ﬁeld can penetrate the superconductor a distance
roughly l, the system need not expend an energy per unit area of ð1=2ÞmoH2l to screen this volume. To
summarize, more than a distance x from the boundary, the energy of the material is lowered (because it is
superconducting), and more than a distance l from the boundary the energy of the material is raised (to
shield the applied ﬁeld).
Now, if l4x, the region of superconducting material greater than l from the boundary but less than x will
be higher in energy than that in the bulk of the material. Thus, the surface energy of the boundary is positive
and therefore costs the total system some energy. This class of superconductors is known as type I. Most
elemental superconductors, such as, aluminum, tin, and lead, are type I. In addition to having l4x, type I
superconductors are generally characterized by low critical temperatures (,5 K) and critical ﬁelds (,0.05 T).
Typical type I superconductors and their properties are listed in Table 28.2.
Conversely, if l4j, the surface energy associated with the boundary is negative and lowers the total system
energy. It is therefore thermodynamically favorable for a normal superconducting interface to form inside
these type II materials. Consequently, this class of superconductors does not exhibit the simple Meissner effect
as do type I materials. Instead, there are now two critical ﬁelds: for applied ﬁelds below the lower critical ﬁeld,
Hc1, a type II superconductor is in the Meissner state, and for applied ﬁelds greater than the upper critical
ﬁeld, Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. The three critical ﬁelds are related to each other by Hc < ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
Hc1Hc2
p
.
In the range Hc1 4 H 4 Hc2, a type II superconductor is said to be in the vortex state because now the
applied ﬁeld can enter the bulk superconductor. Because ﬂux exists in the material, however, the
superconductivity is destroyed locally, creating normal regions. Recall that for type II materials the boundary

between the normal and superconducting regions lowers the overall energy of the system. Therefore, the ﬂux
in the superconductor creates as many normal-superconducting interfaces as possible without violating
quantum criteria. The net result is that ﬂux enters a type II superconductor in quantized bundles of magnitude
Fo known as vortices or ﬂuxons (the former name derives from the fact that current ﬂows around each
quantized bundle in the same manner as a ﬂuid vortex circulates around a drain). The central portion of a
vortex, known as the core, is a normal region with an approximate radius x. If a defect-free superconductor is
placed in a magnetic ﬁeld, the individual vortices, whose cores essentially follow the local average ﬁeld lines,
form an ordered triangular array, or ﬂux lattice. As the applied ﬁeld is raised beyond Hc1 (where the ﬁrst
vortex enters the superconductor), the distance between adjacent vortex cores decreases to maintain the
appropriate ﬂux density in the material. Finally, the upper critical ﬁeld is reached when the normal cores
overlap and the material is no longer superconducting. Indeed, a precise calculation of Hc2 using the
phenomenological theory developed by Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau yields:

Superconductivity

Type II superconductors are of great technical importance because typical Hc2 values are at least an order of
magnitude greater than the typical Hc values of type I materials. It is therefore possible to use type II materials to
make high-ﬁeld magnet wire. Unfortunately, when current is applied to the wire, there is a Lorentz-like force on
the vortices, causing them to move. Because the moving vortices carry ﬂux, their motion creates a static voltage
drop along the superconducting wire according to Faraday’s law. As a result, the wire no longer has a zero dc
resistance, even though the material is still superconducting. To ﬁx this problem, type II superconductors are
usually fabricated with intentional defects, such as impurities or grain boundaries, in their crystalline structure to
pin the vortices and prevent vortex motion. The pinning is created because the defect locally weakens the
superconductivity in the material, and it is thus energetically favorable for the normal core of the vortex to
overlap the nonsuperconducting region in the material. Critical current densities usually quoted for practical
type II materials really represent the depinning critical current density where the Lorentz-like force can overcome
the pinning force. (The depinning critical current density should not be confused with the depairing critical
current density, which represents the current when the Cooper pairs have enough kinetic energy to overcome
their correlation. The depinning critical current density is typically an order of magnitude less than the depairing
critical current density, the latter of which represents the theoretical maximum for Jc.)
By careful manufacturing, it is possible to make superconducting wire with tremendous amounts of
current-carrying capacity. For example, standard copper wire used in homes will carry about 107 A/m2,
whereas a practical type II superconductor like niobium-titanium can carry current densities of 1010 A/m2 or
higher even in ﬁelds of several teslas. This property, more than a zero dc resistance, is what makes
superconducting wire so desirable.

Introduction
Dielectrics are materials that are used primarily to isolate components electrically from each other or ground,
or to act as capacitive elements in devices, circuits, and systems. Their insulating properties are directly
attributable to their large energy gap between the highest ﬁlled valence band and the conduction band. The
number of electrons in the conduction band is extremely low, because the energy gap of a dielectric (5 to 7 eV)
is sufﬁciently large to maintain most of the electrons trapped in the lower band. As a consequence, a dielectric
subjected to an electric ﬁeld, will evince only an extremely small conduction or loss current. This current will
be caused by the ﬁnite number of free electrons available in addition to other free charge carriers (ions)
associated usually with contamination by electrolytic impurities, as well as dipole orientation losses arising
with polar molecules under ac conditions. Often the two latter effects will tend to obscure the miniscule
contribution of the relatively few free electrons available. Unlike solids and liquids, vacuum and gases (in their
nonionized state) approach the conditions of a perfect insulator, i.e., they exhibit virtually no detectable loss or
leakage current.
Two fundamental parameters characterizing a dielectric material are its conductivity s and the value of the
real permittivity or dielectric constant e0. By deﬁnition, s is equal to the ratio of the leakage current density Jl
to the applied electric ﬁeld E:
s ¼ J1
E
ð29:1Þ
Since Jl is in A cm2 and E in V cm1, the corresponding units of s are in S cm1 or O1 cm1. Alternatively,
when only mobile charge carriers of charge e and mobility m, in cm2 V1 sec1, with a concentration of n per
cm3 are involved, the conductivity may be expressed as
s ¼ emn
ð29:2Þ
29-1

The conductivity is usually determined in terms of the measured insulation resistance R in O; it is then given
by s ¼ d/RA, where d is the insulation thickness in cm and A the surface area in cm2. Most practical insulating
materials have conductivities ranging from 106 to 1020 S cm1. Often dielectrics may be classiﬁed in terms
of their resistivity value r, which by deﬁnition is equal to the reciprocal of s.
The real value of the permittivity or dielectric constant e0 is determined from the ratio:
e0 ¼ C
C0
ð29:3Þ
where C represents the measured capacitance in F and C0 is the equivalent capacitance in vacuo, which is
calculated for the same specimen geometry from C0 ¼ eoA/d; here, e0 denotes the permittivity in vacuo and is
equal to 8.854 · 1014 F cm1 (8.854 · 1012 F m1 in SI units) or more conveniently to unity in the Gaussian
CGS system. In practice, the value of e0 in free space is essentially the same as that for a gas (e.g., for air,
e0 ¼ 1.000536). The majority of liquid and solid dielectric materials presently in use have dielectric constants
extending from approximately 2 to 10.
29.2
Dielectric Losses
Under ac conditions dielectric losses arise mainly from the movement of free charge carriers (electrons and
ions), space charge polarization, and dipole orientation [1]. Ionic, space charge, and dipole losses are
temperature- and frequency-dependent, a dependency which is reﬂected in the measured values of s and e0.
This necessitates the introduction of a complex permittivity e deﬁned by
e ¼ e0  je00
ð29:4Þ
where e00 is the imaginary value of the permittivity, which is equal to s/o. Note that the conductivity s
determined under ac conditions may include the contributions of the dipole orientation, space charge, and
ionic polarization losses in addition to that of the drift of free charge carriers (ions and electrons) which
determine its dc value.
The complex permittivity, e, is equal to the ratio of the dielectric displacement vector D to the electric ﬁeld
vector E, i.e., e ¼ D=E. Since under ac conditions the appearance of a loss or leakage current is manifest as a
phase angle difference d between the D and E vectors, then in complex notation D and E may be expressed as
D0 exp ½ jot  d	 and E0 exp½ jot	, respectively, where o is the radial frequency term, t the time, and D0 and E0
the respective magnitudes of the two vectors. From the relationship between D and E, it follows that
e0 ¼ D0
E0
cos d
ð29:5Þ
and
e00 ¼ D0
E0
sin d
ð29:6Þ
It is customary under ac conditions to assess the magnitude of loss of a given material in terms of the value of
its dissipation factor, tan d; it is apparent from Equation (29.5) and Equation (29.6), that:
tan d ¼ e00
e0 ¼ s
oe0
ð29:7Þ

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Examination of Equation (29.7) suggests that the behavior of a
dielectric material may also be described by means of an
equivalent electrical circuit. It is most commonplace and
expedient to use a parallel circuit representation, consisting of
a capacitance C in parallel with a large resistance R as
delineated in Figure 29.1. Here, C represents the capacitance
and R the resistance of the dielectric. For an applied voltage V
across the dielectric, the leakage current is Il ¼ V/R and the
displacement current is IC ¼ joCV; since tan d ¼ Il/IC, then:
tan d ¼
1
oRC
ð29:8Þ
It is to be emphasized that in Equation (29.8), the quantities
R and C are functions of temperature, frequency, and voltage.
The equivalence between Equation (29.7) and Equation (29.8)
becomes more palpable if Il and IC are expressed as oe00CoV and joe00CoV, respectively.
Every loss mechanism will exhibit its own characteristic tan d loss peak, centered at a particular absorption
frequency o0 for a given test temperature. The loss behavior will be contingent upon the molecular structure
of the material, its thickness and homogeneity, and the temperature, frequency, and electric ﬁeld range over
which the measurements are performed [1]. For example, dipole orientation losses will be manifested only if
the material contains permanent molecular or side-link dipoles; a considerable overlap may occur between the
permanent dipole and ionic relaxation regions. Ionic relaxation losses occur in dielectric structures where ions
are able to execute short-range jumps between two or more equilibrium positions. Interfacial or space charge
polarization will arise with insulations of multilayered structures where the conductivity and permittivity are
different for the individual strata or where one dielectric phase is interspersed in the matrix of another
dielectric. Space charge traps also occur at crystalline-amorphous interfaces, crystal defects, and oxidation and
localized C–H dipole sites in polymers. Alternatively, space charge losses will occur with mobile charge carriers
whose movement becomes limited at the electrodes. This type of mechanism takes place often in thin-ﬁlm
dielectrics and exhibits a pronounced thickness effect. If the various losses are considered schematically on a
logarithmic frequency scale at a given temperature, then the tan d and e0 values will appear as functions of
frequency as delineated schematically in Figure 29.2. For many materials the dipole and ionic relaxation losses
tend to predominate over the frequency range extending from about 0.5 to 300 MHz, depending upon the
molecular structure of the dielectric and temperature. For example, the absorption peak of an oil may occur at
1 MHz, while that of a much lower viscosity ﬂuid such as water may appear at approximately 100 MHz. There
is considerable overlap between the dipole and ionic relaxation losses, because the ionic jump distances are
ordinarily of the same order of magnitude as the radii of the permanent dipoles. Space charge polarization
losses manifest themselves normally over the low-frequency region extending from 106 Hz to 1 MHz and are
characterized by very broad and intense peaks; this behavior is apparent from Equation (29.7), which indicates
that even small conductivities may lead to very large tan d values at very low frequencies. The nonrelaxation-
type electronic conduction losses are readily perceptible over the low-frequency spectrum and decrease
monotonically with frequency.
The dielectric loss behavior may be phenomenologically described by the Pellat–Debye equations, relating
the imaginary and real values of the permittivity to the relaxation time, t, of the loss process (i.e., the
frequency at which the e00 peak appears: f0 ¼ 1/2 pt), the low-frequency or static value of the real permittivity,
es, and the high- or optical-frequency value of the real permittivity, e1. Thus, for a loss process characterized
by a single relaxation time:

and

ð29:10Þ
In practice, Equation (29.9) and Equation (29.10) are modiﬁed due to a distribution in the relaxation times
either because several different loss processes are involved or as a result of interaction or cooperative
movement between the discrete dipoles or the trapped and detrapped charge carriers in their own particular
environment. Since the relaxation processes are thermally activated, an increase in temperature will cause a
displacement of the loss peak to higher frequencies. In the case of ionic and dipole relaxation, the relaxation
time may be described by the relation:
t ¼ h

ð29:11Þ
where h is the Planck constant (6.624 · 1034 J s1), k the Boltzmann constant (1.38 · 1023 J K 1), DH the
activation energy of the relaxation process, R the universal gas constant (8.314 · 103 J K 1 kmol1), and DS
the entropy of activation. For the ionic relaxation process, t may alternatively be taken as equal to 1/2G, where
G denotes the ion jump probability between two equilibrium positions. Also for dipole orientation in liquids,
t may be approximately equated to the Debye term Z/4pr3T, where Z represents the macroscopic viscosity of
the liquid and r is the dipole radius [2]. With interfacial or space charge polarization, which may arise due to
a pile-up of charges at the interface of two contiguous dielectrics of different conductivity and permittivity,
Equation (29.10) must be rewritten as [3]

addition, voltage-dependent, the values of t and e00 will in turn also be inﬂuenced by these three variables.
Space charge processes involving electrons are more effectively analyzed, using dc measurement techniques. If
retrapping of electrons in polymers is neglected, then the decay current as a function of time t, arising from
detrapped electrons, assumes the form [4]
iðtÞ ¼ kT
vt nðEÞ
ð29:14Þ
where n(E) is the trap density and v is the attempt jump frequency of the electrons. The electron
current displays the usual t1 dependence and the plot of i(t)t vs. kT ln(vt) yields the distribution of trap
depths. Equation (29.14) represents an approximation, which underestimates the current associated with the
shallow traps and overcompensates for the current due to the deep traps. The mobility of the free charge
carriers is determined by the depth of the traps, the ﬁeld resulting from the trapped charges, and the
temperature. At elevated temperatures and low space charge ﬁelds, the mobility is proportional to
exp[DH/kT], and at low temperatures to (T)1/4 [5]. A high trapped charge density will create intense
ﬁelds, which will in turn exert a controlling inﬂuence on the mobility and the charge distribution proﬁle.
In polymers, shallow traps are of the order of 0.5 to 0.9 eV and deep traps are ca. 1.0 to 1.5 eV, while the
activation energies of dipole orientation and ionic conduction in solid and liquid dielectrics fall within
the same range. It is known that most charge trapping in the volume occurs in the vicinity of the electrodes;
this can now be conﬁrmed by measurement, using methods based on pressure wave propagation, thermal
diffusion, and voltage pulse application [6]. In the ﬁrst procedure, an elastic wave traveling at the speed of
sound is transmitted along the dielectric specimen. This causes displacement of charges within the specimen,
thereby creating an electrical signal which is readily detected at the measuring electrodes. In the thermal
diffusion technique, variation of the temperature at one end of the specimen gives rise to nonuniform
diffusion of heat along the dielectric, thereby leading again to a displacement of charges along its path and
hence an associated electrical signal. The third method, which involves a rapid application of voltage pulses
across the dielectric specimen, is commonly referred to as the pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method. It is,
perhaps due to its simplicity, the most popular of the three test procedures. The applied electrical pulses
produce pressure waves within the dielectric bulk of charge density r(x) and surface charge density of s1
and s2 at the two respective electrodes. A portion of the transmitted pressure waves traversing the low
potential electrode is detected by means of an acoustical transducer which provides a proportional electrical
signal output. Hence, the ﬁrst detected pressure wave is comprised of three components, namely that due to
the low or ground potential electrode [7]:

where c2 denotes the acoustical velocity and ep the electrical ﬁeld; d is the thickness of the specimen; and k1, k2,
and k3 (with k1 ¼ k2 and k
0 ¼ k3/k1) are constants determined by the acoustical impedances of the two
electrodes and the specimen, respectively. The received electrical signals are correlated with the acoustical wave
by means of a deconvolution procedure to obtain the proﬁle of the trapped charge r(x). Errors in the
measurement are primarily due to electrode surface charge effects and difﬁculties in distinguishing between
the polarization of the polar dipoles and that of the trapped charges [8]. Moreover, while the three methods
for determining the charge density distribution have a common theoretical basis, the agreement between the
charge density distributions derived, utilizing the three methods, may in some cases be rather tenuous [9].
Temperature inﬂuences the real value of the permittivity or dielectric constant, e0, insofar as it affects the
density of the dielectric material. As the density diminishes with temperature, e0 falls with temperature in
accordance with the Clausius–Mossotti equation:
½P	 ¼ ðe0  1Þ
ðe0 þ 2Þ
M
d0
ð29:18Þ
where [P] represents the polarization per mole, M the molar mass, d0 the density at a given temperature, and
e0 ¼ es. Equation (29.18) is equally valid if the substitution e0 ¼ (n0)2 is made; here n0 is the real value of the
index of refraction. In fact, the latter provides a direct connection with the dielectric behavior at optical
frequencies. In analogy with the complex permittivity, the index of refraction is also a complex quantity, and
its imaginary value n00 exhibits a loss peak at the absorption frequencies; however, in contrast to the e0 value,
which can only fall with frequency, the real index of refraction, n0, exhibits an inﬂection-like behavior at the
absorption frequency. This is illustrated schematically in Figure 29.2 which depicts the kn0 or n00 and n01
values as a function of frequency over the optical frequency regime. The absorption in the infrared results from
atomic resonance that arises from a displacement and vibration of atoms relative to each other, while an
electronic resonance absorption effect occurs over the ultraviolet frequencies as a consequence of the electrons
being forced to execute vibrations at the frequency of the external ﬁeld.
The characterization of dielectric materials must be carried out in order to determine their properties for
various applications over different parts of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. There are many techniques
and methods available for this purpose, which are too numerous and detailed to attempt to present here even in a
cursory manner. However, Figure 29.3 portrays schematically the different test methods that are commonly used
to carry out the characterization over the different frequencies up to and including the optical regime [10].
A direct relationship exists between the time and frequency domain test methods via the Laplace transforms.
The frequency response of dielectrics at the more elevated frequencies is primarily of interest in the electrical
communications ﬁeld. In contradistinction for electrical power generation, transmission, and distribution, it is
the low-frequency spectrum that constitutes the area of application. Also, the use of higher voltages in the
electrical power area necessarily requires detailed knowledge of how the electrical losses vary as a function of the
electrical ﬁeld. Since most electrical power apparatus operates at a ﬁxed frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, the main
variable apart from the temperature is the applied or operating voltage. At power frequencies the dipole losses are
generally very small and invariant with voltage up to the saturation ﬁelds, which exceed substantially the
operating ﬁelds, being in the order of 107 kV cm1 or more. However, both the space charge polarization and
29-6
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

ionic losses are highly ﬁeld-dependent. As the electrical ﬁeld is increased, ions of opposite sign are increasingly
segregated; this hinders their recombination and, in effect, enhances the ion charge carrier concentration. As the
dissociation rate of the ionic impurities is further augmented by temperature increases, combined rises in
temperature and ﬁeld may lead to appreciable dielectric loss. Thus, for example, for a thin liquid ﬁlm bounded by
two solids, tan d increases with voltage until at some upper voltage value, the physical boundaries begin to ﬁnally
limit the amplitude of the ion excursions, at which point tan d commences a downward trend with voltage
(Bo¨ning–Garton effect). The interfacial or space charge polarization losses may evince a rather intricate ﬁeld
dependence, depending upon the manner in which the discrete conductivities of the contiguous media change
with applied voltage and temperature (as is apparent from the nature of Equation (29.12) and Equation (29.13)).
The exact frequency value at which the space charge loss exhibits its maximum is contingent upon the value of the
relaxation time t. Figure 29.4 depicts typical tan d versus applied voltage characteristics for an oil-impregnated
paper-insulated cable model at two different temperatures, in which the loss behavior is primarily governed by
ionic conduction and space charge effects. The monotonically rising dissipation factor with increasing applied
voltage at room temperature is indicative of the predominating ionic loss mechanism, while at 85–C, an incipient
decrease in tan d is suggestive of space charge effects.
29.3
Dielectric Breakdown
As the voltage is increased across a dielectric material, a point is ultimately reached beyond which the
insulation will no longer be capable of sustaining any further rise in voltage and breakdown will ensue, causing
a short to develop between the electrodes. If the dielectric consists of a gas or liquid medium, the breakdown
will be self-healing in the sense that the gas or liquid will support anew a reapplication of voltage until another
breakdown recurs. In a solid dielectric, however, the initial breakdown will result in the formation of a
permanent conductive channel, which cannot support a reapplication of voltage. The dielectric breakdown
processes are distinctly different for the three states of matter.
FIGURE 29.3
Frequency range of various dielectric test methods [10].
29-7
Dielectrics and Insulators

In the case of solid dielectrics the breakdown is dependent not only upon the molecular structure and
morphology of the solid but also upon extraneous variables, such as the geometry of the material, the
temperature, and the ambient environment. Since breakdown often occurs along some fault of the material,
the breakdown voltage displays a readily perceptible decrease with area and thickness of the specimen due to
increased incidence of faults over larger volumes. This is indeed part of the reason why thin-ﬁlm inorganic
dielectrics, which are normally evaluated using small-diameter dot counter electrodes, exhibit exceptionally high
dielectric strengths. With large organic dielectric specimens, recessed electrodes are used to minimize electrode
edge effects, leading to greatly elevated breakdown strengths in the order of 106 to 107 kV cm1, a range of values
considered to represent the ultimate breakdown strength of the material or its intrinsic breakdown strength; as
the intrinsic breakdown occurs in approximately 108 to 106 sec, an electronic mechanism is implicated.
The breakdown strength under dc and impulse conditions tends to exceed that at ac ﬁelds, thereby suggesting
the ac breakdown process may be partially of a thermal nature. An additional factor that may lower the ac
breakdown strength is that associated with the occurrence of partial discharges either in void inclusions or at the
electrode edges; this leads to breakdown values very much less than the intrinsic value. In practice, the
breakdowns are generally of an extrinsic nature, and the intrinsic values are useful conceptually in so far as they
provide an idea of an upper value that can be attained only under ideal conditions. The intrinsic breakdown
theories were essentially developed for crystalline dielectrics, for which it was assumed that a very small number
of thermally activated electrons can be thermally excited to move from the valence to the conduction band and
that under the inﬂuence of an external ﬁeld they will be impelled to move in the direction of the ﬁeld, colliding
with the lattice of the crystalline dielectric and dissipating their energy by phonon interactions [11]. Accordingly,
breakdown is said to occur when the average rate of energy gain by the electrons, A(E, T, Te, j ), exceeds that lost in
collisions with the lattice, B(T, Te, j ). Hence, the breakdown criterion can be stated as
AðE; T; Te; xÞ ¼ BðT; Te; xÞ
ð29:19Þ
where E is the applied ﬁeld, T the lattice temperature, Te the electron temperature, and j an energy distribution
constant. Thus, in qualitative terms, as the temperature is increased gradually, the breakdown voltage rises
because the interaction between the electrons and the lattice is enhanced as a result of the increased thermal
vibrations of the lattice. Ultimately, a critical temperature is attained where the electron–electron interactions
surpass in importance those between the electrons and the lattice, and the breakdown strength commences a
monotonic decline with temperature; this behavior is borne out in NaCl crystals, as is apparent from
Figure 29.5 [12]. However, with amorphous or partially crystalline polymers, as, for example, with
polyethylene, the maximum in breakdown strength is seen to be absent and only a decrease is observed [13];
as the crystalline content is increased in amorphous-crystalline solids, the breakdown strength is reduced.

It is generally believed that lamellar crystalline regions
play a predominant role in determining the electrical
characteristics of polyethylene [14].
The electron avalanche concept has also been applied
to explain breakdown in solids, in particular to account
for the observed decrease in breakdown strength with
insulation thickness. Since breakdown due to electron
avalanches involves the formation of space charge, space
charges will tend to modify the conditions for break-
down. Any destabilization of the trapping and detrapping
process, such as may be caused by a perturbation of the
electrical ﬁeld, will initiate the breakdown event [5].
The detrapping of mobile charge carriers will be
accompanied by photon emission and formation of
the plasma breakdown channel, resulting in the dissipa-
tion of polarization energy. If dipole interaction is
neglected, the polarization energy due to a trapped
charge is of the order of 5w eV, where w is the dielectric susceptibility. The release of the polarization energy will be
accompanied by electrical tree growth in and melting of the polymer.
The electrical breakdown process in gases is relatively well understood and is explained in terms of the
avalanche theory. A free electron, occurring in a gas due to cosmic radiation, will be accelerated in a ﬁeld
and upon collision with neutral molecules in its trajectory will eject, if its energy is sufﬁcient, other
electrons that will in turn undergo additional collisions resulting in a production of more free electrons. If
the electric ﬁeld is sufﬁciently high, the number of free electrons will increase exponentially along the
collision route until ultimately an electron avalanche will form. As the fast-moving electrons in the gap
disappear into the anode, they leave behind the slower-moving ions, which gradually drift to the cathode
where they liberate further electrons with a probability g. When the height of the positive ion avalanche
becomes sufﬁciently large to lead to a regeneration of a starting electron, the discharge mechanism becomes
self-sustaining and a spark bridges the two electrodes. The condition for the Townsend breakdown in a
short gap is given by
g½expðadÞ  1	 ¼ 1
ð29:20Þ
where d is the distance between the electrodes and a represents the number of ionizing impacts per
electron per unit distance. The value of g is also enhanced by photoemission at the cathode and photon
radiation in the gas volume by the metastable and
excited gas atoms or molecules. In fact, in large gaps
the breakdown is governed by streamer formation in
which photon emission from the avalanches plays a
dominant role. Breakdown characteristics of gases are
represented graphically in terms of the Paschen curves,
which are plots of the breakdown voltage as a function
of the product of gas pressure p and the electrode
separation d. Each gas is characterized by a well-
deﬁned minimum breakdown voltage at one particular
value of the pd product as depicted in Figure 29.6
[15]. In short gaps, the breakdown may assume either
the form of a spark discharge (constricted breakdown
channel) or that of a glow or pseudoglow discharge
(a highly diffused breakdown channel encompassing
usually the entire intervening electrode area) [16].

Dielectrics and Insulators

The breakdown process in liquids is perhaps the least
understood due to a lack of a satisfactory theory on the
liquid state. The avalanche theory has been applied with
limited success to explain the breakdown in liquids, by
assuming that electrons injected from an electrode surface
exchange energy with the atoms or molecules of the liquid,
ultimately causing the atoms and molecules to ionize thus
precipitating breakdown. Investigations, utilizing electro-
optical techniques, have demonstrated that breakdown
involves streamers with tree- or bush-like structures that
propagate from the electrodes [17]. High-pressure cavities,
which are the precursors to breakdown streamer develop-
ment, are initiated by electrical ﬁeld enhancement sites that
occur at asperities or protrusions on electrode surfaces.
These microcavities undergo partial discharge as they
expand until their ultimate collapse when their internal
pressure falls to the ambient hydrostatic pressure within the
dielectric liquids [18]. If the external ﬁeld attains its
breakdown value, then the cavities develop into breakdown
streamers. The partial discharges within these prebreakdown
cavities occur in the form of pulse bursts (c.f. Figure 29.7),
whose duration corresponds to the time interval between the
initiation and collapse of the cavities [19]. The negative streamers, emerging from the cathode, form due to
electron emission, while positive streamers originating at the anode are due to free electrons in the liquid itself.
The breakdown of liquids is noticeably affected by electrolytic impurities as well as water and oxygen content;
also, macroscopic particles may form bridges between the electrodes along which electrons may hop with
relative ease, resulting in a lower breakdown. As in solids, there is a volume effect and breakdown strength
decreases with thickness; a slight increase in breakdown voltage is also observed with viscosity.
Thermal breakdown may occur at localized hot spots where the rate of heat generated exceeds that
dissipated by the surrounding medium. The temperature at such hot spots continues to rise until it becomes
sufﬁciently high to induce fusion and vaporization, causing eventually the development of a channel along
which breakdown ensues between the opposite electrodes. Since a ﬁnite amount of time is required for the
heat buildup to occur to lead to the thermal instability, thermally induced breakdown is contingent upon the
time of the alternating voltage application and is thus implicated as the leading cause of breakdown in many
solid and solid-liquid insulating systems under long-term operating conditions. However, under some
circumstances thermal instability may develop over a very short time; for example, some materials have been
found to undergo thermal breakdown when subjected to very short repetitive voltage pulses. In low-loss solid
dielectrics, such as polyethylene, the occurrence of thermal breakdown is highly improbable under low
operating temperatures, while glasses with signiﬁcant ionic content are more likely to fail thermally,
particularly at higher frequencies.
The criterion for thermal breakdown under ac conditions may be stated as
KADT=‘ ¼ oe0E2 tan d
ð29:21Þ
where the left-hand side represents the heat transfer in J s1 along a length ‘ (cm) of sectional area A (cm2) of
the dielectric surface in the direction of the temperature gradient due to the temperature difference DT, in –C,
such that the units of the thermal conductivity constant K are in J –C 1 cm1 sec1. The right-hand side of
Equation (29.21) is equal to the dielectric loss dissipated in the dielectric in J sec1, where E is the external
ﬁeld, e0 the real value of the permittivity, and tan d the dissipation factor at the radial frequency o.

Other causes of extrinsic breakdown are associated with particular defects in the dielectric or with the
environmental conditions under which the dielectric material is employed. For example, some solid dielectrics
may contain gas-ﬁlled cavities that are inherent with the porous structure of the dielectric or that may be
inadvertently introduced either during the manufacturing process or created under load cycling. If the
operating electrical ﬁeld is sufﬁciently elevated to cause the gas within the cavities to undergo discharge,
the dielectric will be subjected to both physical and chemical degradation by the partial discharges; should
the discharge process be sustained over a sufﬁciently long period, breakdown may eventually ensue.
With overhead line insulators or bushings of electrical equipment, breakdown may occur along the surface
rather than in the bulk of the material. Insulator surfaces consisting of porcelain, glass, or polymeric materials
(usually elastomers) may become contaminated by either industrial pollutants or salt spray near coastal areas,
leading to surface tracking and breakdown below the normal ﬂashover voltage. Surface tracking is enhanced in
the presence of moisture, which increases the surface conductivity, particularly in the presence of ionic
contaminants [20]. The latter is measured in S or O1 and must be distinguished from the volume
conductivity whose units are stated in S cm1 or O1 cm1. Surface tracking may be prevented by cleaning the
surface and by applying silicone greases. When insulators are employed under a vacuum environment, charge
accumulation will occur on the surface because the charged surface will no longer be able to discharge due to
the ﬁnite breakdown strength of an ambient gas. Space charge will thus play a dominant role in the surface
breakdown mechanism [21].
29.4
Insulation Aging
All insulating materials will undergo varying degrees of aging or deterioration under normal operating
conditions. The rate of aging will be contingent upon the magnitude of the electrical, thermal, and mechanical
stresses to which the material is subjected; it will also be inﬂuenced by the composition and molecular
structure of the material itself as well as the chemical, physical, and radiation environment under which the
material must perform. The useful life of an insulating system will thus be determined by a given set and
subset of aging variables. For example, the subset of variables in the voltage stress variable are the average and
maximum values of the applied voltage, its frequency, and the recurrence rate of superposed impulse or
transient voltage surges. For the thermal stress, the upper and lower ambient temperatures, the temperature
gradient in the insulation, and the maximum permissible operating temperature constitute the subvariable set.
Also, the character of the mechanical stress will differ, depending upon whether torsion, compression, or
tension and bending are involved. Furthermore, the aging rate will be differently affected if all stresses
(electrical, thermal, and mechanical) act simultaneously, separately, or in some predetermined sequence. The
inﬂuence exerted on the aging rate by the environment will depend on whether the insulation system will be
subjected to corrosive chemicals, petroleum ﬂuids, water or high humidity, air or oxygen, or ultraviolet and
nuclear radiation. Organic insulations, in particular, may experience chemical degradation in the presence of
oxygen. For example, polyethylene under temperature cycle will undergo both physical and chemical changes.
These effects will be particularly acute at the emergency operating temperatures (90 to 130–C); at these
temperatures partial or complete melting of the polymer will occur and the increased diffusion rate will permit
the oxygen to migrate to a greater depth into the polymer. Ultimately, the antioxidant will be consumed,
resulting in an embrittlement of polymer and in extreme cases in the formation of macroscopic cracks.
Subjection of the polymer to many overload cycles will be accompanied by repeated melting and
recrystallization of the polymer—a process that will inevitably cause the formation of cavities, which, when
subjected to sufﬁciently high voltages, will undergo discharge.
There is a general consensus that electrically induced aging involves the mechanisms of treeing, partial
discharge, and dielectric heating. Dielectric heating failures are more characteristic of lossy insulations or when
highly conductive contaminants are involved. In the treeing mechanism, a distinction must be made between
electrical and water trees [1]. The former refers to growth, resembling a tree, that occurs under dry conditions in
the presence of an electric ﬁeld; its branches or channels are hollow. In contrast, water trees require the presence
of moisture, and their branches consist of ﬁne ﬁlamentary channels, joining small cavities, all of which contain
29-11
Dielectrics and Insulators

water; when placed in a dry environment, they eventually disappear. In a translucent dielectric, water trees are
invisible and are rendered visible only when stained with a die, whereas electrical trees once formed remain
readily discernible. Water trees are intrinsic to solid polymeric insulation, while electrical trees may occur in
both solid and impregnated insulating systems. The actual failure path, when the breakdown current is limited
to prevent destruction of evidence, even in liquids, invariably consists of an electrical treelike structure.
Both electrical and water trees tend to propagate from electrical stress enhancement points, with water
trees requiring appreciably lower stresses for their inception (ca. 2 kV mm1). Whereas the electrical tree
mechanism usually involves partial discharges, the occurrence of the latter is conspicuously absent in water
trees [22]. The fact that water trees may bridge the opposite electrodes without precipitating failure infers a
nonconductive nature of the branches. Yet water trees are implicated in the overall degradation and aging
process of solid dielectrics, because of their presence in areas of failure as well as because of the often-
observed phenomenon of an electrical tree emerging from some point along a water tree and causing abrupt
failure [1].
The presence of voids or cavities within a solid or solid–liquid insulating system may lead to eventual
failure, with the proviso that the electrical ﬁeld is sufﬁciently elevated to induce them to undergo either
continuous or regularly recurring, though at times intermittent, discharge. While it is well recognized that
some insulating systems are more resistant to partial discharges than others, it has not been possible thus far
to arrive at any deﬁnite relationship between the partial discharge intensity and the life expectancy of
insulating materials. Electrical trees may readily ensue from charge injection sites adjacent to discharging
cavity inclusions. It has been suggested that the time required for electrical tree initiation may be deﬁned
quasi-empirically as [23]:
t ¼
Nc
2bfno½expðal  1Þ	
ð29:22Þ
where Nc denotes the critical number of impact ionizations necessary for tree channel formation, l is the
avalanche or newly formed tree length, no is the number of initiating electrons, and b is a constant dependent
on the frequency, f. The deterioration rate due to partial discharges is proportional to the power dissipated P
by the discharges, which may be expressed as [1]:
P ¼
X
l
i¼1
X
m
j¼1
nijDQijVij
ð29:23Þ
where nij is the recurrence rate of the jth discharge pulse in the ith cavity and DQij is its corresponding charge
transfer at the instantaneous voltage Vij. Under ac conditions, the discharges will tend to recur regularly in
each cycle due to the capacitative voltage division across the void. Under dc conditions, the discharge rate will
be controlled by the time constant required to recharge the cavity following a previous discharge. The physical
damage arising from discharges consists of surface erosion and pitting, and is caused by the ion and electron
bombardment incident on the void’s walls at a given discharge site. Chemical degradation results from
molecular chain scission due to particle impact on the surface and the reactions between the ambient ionized
gases and the gases released due to the molecular chain scission processes. The ﬁnal chemical composition of
the reaction products is generally varied, depending primarily on the molecular structure of the dielectric
materials involved and the composition of the ambient ionized gases; one discharge degradation product
common to many polymers exposed to discharges in air is that of oxalic acid. Oxalic acid, as a result of its
elevated conductivity, when deposited upon the cavity’s walls may change the nature of the discharge (e.g.,
from a spark to a pseudoglow or glow type) or may even ultimately extinguish the discharge (i.e., replace the
discharge loss by an I2R-type loss along the cavity’s walls). There are various procedures available for detecting,
locating, and identifying partial discharge sources in electrical apparatus and cables [24]. These may employ
pulse reﬂectometry methods, capacitive and inductive probes, acoustical transducers as well as ultraviolet
detectors. Also partial discharge pulse pattern recognition and classiﬁcation techniques, utilizing principally
29-12
Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

neural networks, fuzzy logic, and other intelligent machine procedures, have been applied with considerable
success [25].
A number of aging models have been propounded to predict insulation aging under different types of stress.
However, there are essentially only two models whose usefulness has been substantiated in practice and which
have, therefore, gained wide acceptance. One of these is Dakin’s classical thermal degradation model, which is
based upon the approach used in chemical reaction rate theory [26]:
t ¼ A exp½DH=kT	
ð29:24Þ
where t represents the time to breakdown, A is a preexponential constant, DH is the activation energy of the
aging process, T is the absolute temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 3 · 1023 J K1). If the log
t versus 1/T plot represents a straight line obtained when the insulation aging is accelerated at various
temperatures above the operating temperature, extrapolation of the line to the operating temperature may
yield a rudimentary estimate of the service life that can be anticipated from the insulation system when
operated under normal temperature and load conditions. Deviations from straight-line behavior are indicative
of more than one thermal aging mechanism; for example, a polymeric insulation will exhibit such behavior
when thermally stressed beyond its melting or phase transition temperature.
Another extremely useful classical model, applicable to accelerated aging studies under electrical stress, is
the so-called inverse power law relationship given by [26]:
t ¼ BEn
ð29:25Þ
where t is the time to breakdown under an electric stress E, B is a constant, and n is an exponent parameter.
The relationship is essentially empirical in nature, and its proof of validity rests primarily on experiment and
observation. It is found that a single type of electrically induced aging process will generally result in a straight-
line relationship between log t and log E. Consequently, aging data obtained at higher electrical stresses with
correspondingly shorter times to breakdown when extrapolated to longer times at stresses in the vicinity of the
operating stress may thus conceivably yield a rudimentary service life estimate under the operating stress. The
slope of the line determines the exponent n, which constitutes an approximate indicator of the type of aging
involved. For example, with polymer insulation water treeing ordinarily results in n values less than 4, while
under conditions that may involve discharges and electrical trees, the n values may approach 10 or greater.
When accelerated aging tests are carried out to determine life expectancy estimates of newly developed
electrical insulating systems, it is advantageous to perform those tests under simultaneous electrical, thermal,
and mechanical stresses in order to simulate as much as possible their normal operating conditions. This
permits the use of lower stress factor magnitudes to achieve reasonably acceptable test times, while also
ensuring that the induced degradation mechanisms approximate more closely those that are likely to occur
in service.
29.5
Dielectric Materials
Dielectric materials comprise a variety of solids, liquids, and gases. The breakdown strength generally increases
with the density of the material so that dielectric solids as well as liquids tend to have higher dielectric
strengths than gases. The same tendency is observed also with the dielectric loss and permittivity; for example,
the dielectric losses in gases are virtually too small to be measurable and their dielectric constant in most
practical applications can be considered as unity. In this section, we shall describe a number of the more
common insulating materials in use.
Gases
The 60-Hz breakdown strength of a 1 cm gap of air at 25–C under atmospheric pressure is 31.7 kV cm1.
Although this is a relatively low value, air is a most useful insulating medium for large electrode separations as
29-13
Dielectrics and Insulators

is the case for overhead transmission lines. The only dielectric losses in the overhead lines are those due to
corona discharges at the line conductor surfaces and leakage losses over the insulator surfaces. In addition, the
highly reduced capacitance between the conductors of the lines ensures a small capacitance per unit length,
thus rendering overhead lines an efﬁcient means for transmitting large amounts of power over long distances.
Nitrogen, which has a slightly higher breakdown strength (33.4 kV cm1) than air, has been used when
compressed in low-loss gas-insulated capacitors. However, as air, which was also used in its compressed form
in circuit breakers, it has been replaced by sulfur hexaﬂuoride, SF6. The breakdown strength of SF6 is ca.
79.3 kV cm1. Since the outside metal casing of metal-clad circuit breakers is ordinarily grounded, it has
become common practice to have much of the substation interconnected bus and interrupting switching
equipment insulated with SF6. To achieve higher breakdown strengths, the SF6 gas is compressed at pressures
on the order of 6 atm. The use of SF6 in substation equipment has resulted in the saving of space and the
elimination of line insulator pollution problems; however, its extensive usage has also posed some
environmental concerns in regard to its ﬂuorine content.
The breakdown strength of gases is little affected with increasing frequency until the period of the wave
becomes comparable to the transit time of the ions and, ﬁnally, electrons across the gap. At this point, a
substantial reduction in the breakdown strength is observed.
Insulating Liquids
Insulating liquids are rarely used by themselves and are intended for use mainly as impregnants with cellulose
or synthetic papers. The 60-Hz breakdown strength of practical insulating liquids exceeds that of gases and for
a 1 cm gap separation, it is of the order of about 100 kV cm1. However, since the breakdown strength
increases with decreasing gap length, and as the oils are normally evaluated using a gap separation of
0.254 cm, the breakdown strengths normally cited range from approximately 138 to 240 kV cm1. The
breakdown values are more inﬂuenced by the moisture and particle contents of the ﬂuids than by their
molecular structure (cf. Table 29.1).
Mineral oils have been extensively used in high-voltage electrical apparatus since the turn of the century.
They constitute a category of hydrocarbon liquids that are obtained by reﬁning petroleum crudes. Their
composition consists of parafﬁnic, naphthenic, and aromatic constituents, and is dependent upon the source
of the crude as well as the reﬁning procedure followed. The inclusion of the aromatic constituents is desirable
because of their gas absorption and oxidation characteristics. Mineral oils used for cable and transformer
applications have low polar molecule contents, and are characterized by dielectric constants extending from
about 2.10 to 2.25 with dissipation factors generally between 2 · 105 and 6 · 105 at room temperature,

depending upon their viscosity and molecular weight. Their dissipation factors increase appreciably at higher
temperatures when the viscosities are reduced. Oils may deteriorate in service due to oxidation and moisture
absorption. Filtering and treatment with Fullers’ earth may improve their properties, but special care must be
taken to ensure that the treatment process does not remove the aromatic constituents which are essential to
maintaining the gas-absorption characteristics of the oil.
Alkyl benzenes are used as impregnants in high-voltage cables, often as substitutes of the low-viscosity mineral
oils in self-contained oil-ﬁlled cables [22]. They consist of alkyl chains attached to a benzene ring, having the
general formula C6H5(CH2)nCH3; however, branched alkyl benzenes are also employed. Their electrical
properties are comparable to those of mineral oils, and they exhibit good gas inhibition characteristics. Because
of their detergent character, alkyl benzenes tend to be more susceptible to contamination than mineral oils.
Polybutenes are synthetic oils that are derived from the polymerization of oleﬁns. Their long molecular
chain structures, with isobutene as the base unit, have methyl group side chains with molecular weights in the
range from 300 to 1350. Their electrical properties are comparable to those of mineral oils; due to their low
cost, they have been employed as pipe cable ﬁlling oils. Higher viscosity polybutenes have been also used as
capacitor impregnants. Mixtures of polybutenes and alkyl benzenes have been utilized to obtain higher ac
breakdown strength with impregnated paper systems. They are also compatible and miscible with mineral oils.
Since the discontinued use of the nonﬂammable polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a number of
unsaturated synthetic liquids have been developed for application to capacitors where, due to high stresses, the
evolved gases may readily undergo partial discharge. Most of these new synthetic capacitor ﬂuids are thus gas-
absorbing low-molecular-weight derivatives of benzene, with permittivities ranging from 2.66 to 5.25 at room
temperature (compared to 3.5 for PCBs). None of these ﬂuids has the nonﬂammable characteristics of the
PCBs; however, they do have high boiling points [2].
Halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are derived by replacing the hydrogen by either chlorine or ﬂuorine
or both; they may also contain nitrogen and oxygen in their molecular structure. Their dielectric constants
range from 1.8 to 3.0, the higher value reﬂecting some polarity due to molecular asymmetry as a result of
branching. They have superior thermal properties to mineral oils, and are highly ﬂame-resistant.
Fluorocarbons have been used in large power transformers, where both ﬂammability and heat removal are of
prime concern.
Silicone liquids consist of polymeric chains of silicon atoms alternating with oxygen atoms, with methyl side
groups. For electrical applications, polydimethylsiloxane ﬂuids are used, primarily for transformers as
substitutes for the PCBs, due to their inherently high ﬂash and ﬂammability points and reduced
environmental concerns. They have lower tan d values than mineral oils, but somewhat higher dielectric
constants because of their moderately polar nature. The viscosity of silicone ﬂuids exhibits relatively little
change with temperature, which is attributed to the ease of rotation about the Si–O–Si bond, thereby
overcoming close packing of molecules and reducing intermolecular forces.
There are a large number of organic esters, but only a few are suitable for electrical applications. Their
properties are adversely affected by hydrolysis, oxidation, and water content. Because of their reduced
dielectric losses at elevated frequencies, they have been used in high-frequency capacitors. Castor oil has found
specialized application in energy storage capacitors due to its exceptional resistance to partial discharges. The
dielectric constants of esters are substantially higher than those for mineral oils.
Solid Insulating Materials
Solid insulating materials may be classiﬁed into two main categories: organic and inorganic [1]. There are an
extremely large number of solid insulants available, but in this section only the more commonly representative
solid insulants will be considered.

Electronics, Power Electronics, Optoelectronics, Microwaves, Electromagnetics, and Radar

Alumina (Al2O3) is produced by heating aluminum hydroxide or oxyhydroxide; it is widely used as a ﬁller
for ceramic insulators. Further heating yields the corundum structure which, in its sapphire form, is used for
dielectric substrates in microcircuit applications.
Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is an extraordinary dielectric in that at temperatures below 120–C it behaves as a
ferroelectric. That is, the electric displacement is both a function of the ﬁeld as well as its previous history.
Because of spontaneous polarization of the crystal, a dielectric hysteresis loop is generated. The dielectric
constant is different in the x- and z-axis of the crystal (e.g., at 20–C, e0 4 4000 perpendicular to the z-axis and
e0 5 300 in the x-axis direction).
Porcelain is a multiphase ceramic material that is obtained by heating aluminum silicates until a mullite
(3Al2O3 · 2SiO2) phase is formed. Since mullite is porous, its surface must be glazed with a high-melting-
point glass to render it smooth and impervious, and thus applicable for use in overhead line insulators.
For high-frequency applications, low-loss single-phase ceramics, such as steatite (3MgO · 4SiO2 · H2O), are
preferred.
Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a common inorganic insulating material, which due to its relatively high
thermal conductivity is utilized for insulating heating elements in ovens. The resistance wire elements are
placed concentrically within stainless steel tubes, with magnesium oxide packed around them to provide the
insulation.
Electrical-grade glasses consist principally of SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 structures that are relatively open to
permit ionic diffusion and migration. Consequently, glasses tend to be relatively lossy at high temperatures,
though at low temperatures they are suitable for use in overhead line insulators and in transformer, capacitor,
and circuit breaker bushings. At high temperatures, their main application lies with incandescent and
ﬂuorescent lamps as well as electronic tube envelopes.
Most of the mica used in electrical applications is of the muscovite [KAl2(OH)2Si3AlO10] type. Mica is
a layer-type dielectric, and mica ﬁlms are obtained by the splitting of mica blocks. The extended
two-dimensionally layered strata prevent the formation of conductive pathways across the mica, resulting
in a high dielectric strength. It has excellent thermal stability and due to its inorganic nature is highly
resistant to partial discharges. It is used in sheet, plate, and tape form in rotating machine and
transformer coils. For example, a mica-epoxy composite is employed in stator bar insulation of rotating
machines.
In metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) devices, the semiconductor surface is passivated by thermally growing a
silicon dioxide, SiO2, ﬁlm (about 5000 A˚ ) with the semiconductor silicon wafer exposed to oxygen ambient at
1200–C. The resulting SiO2 dielectric ﬁlm has good adhesion properties, but due to its open glassy structure is
not impervious to ionic impurities (primarily sodium). Accordingly, a denser ﬁlm structure of silicon nitride,
Si3N4, is formed in a reaction between silane and ammonia, and is pyrolytically deposited on the SiO2 layer.
The thin ﬁlm of Si3N4 is characterized by extremely low losses, and its relatively closed structure does not
provide any latitude for free sodium movement, thereby providing complete passivation of the semiconductor
device. The high dielectric strength of the double ﬁlm layer of SiO2 and Si3N4 renders it dielectrically effective
in ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET) applications.
Low loss fused silica (SiO2) is a dielectric, which constitutes the base material of choice for optical ﬁber
communication cables [22]. The optical ﬁbers consist of a silica inner core surrounded by a cladding that
is covered by a protective coating. The light wave guiding characteristics of the silica optical ﬁber are
determined by the index of refraction of the inner core, which is usually enhanced by the use of dopants
such as phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5) or germanium oxide (GeO2), and that of the cladding surrounding
the core, which is lowered slightly below that of the core by the addition of chlorine, ﬂuorine, or boron
oxide (B2O3). The optical ﬁbers are designed to operate within the infrared wavelength regions, extend-
ing from 0.80 to 1.55 mm, and are thus removed from the electronic and atomic absorption regions
(c.f. Figure 29.2).
In integrated circuit devices, a number of materials are suitable for thin-ﬁlm capacitor applications. In
addition to Al2O3, tantalum pentoxide, Ta2O5, has been extensively utilized. It is characterized by high-
temperature stability and is resistant to acids with the exception of hydroﬂuoric acid (HF). The high dielectric
constant material hafnia (HfO2) has also been used in thin-ﬁlm capacitors.
29-17
Dielectrics and Insulators

Organic Solids
Solid organic dielectrics consist of large polymer molecules, which generally have molecular weights in excess
of 600. Primarily, with the exception of paper which consists of cellulose that is comprised of a series of
glucose units, organic dielectric materials are synthetically derived.
Polyethylene (PE) is perhaps one of the most common solid dielectrics, and is extensively used as a solid
dielectric extruded insulant in power and communication cables [22]. Linear PE is classiﬁed as a low- (0.910
to 0.925), medium- (0.926 to 0.940), or high- (0.941 to 0.965) density polymer (cf. Table 29.2). Since PE is
essentially a long-chain hydrocarbon material in which the repeat unit is –CH2–CH2–, a low-density PE
necessarily implies a high degree of branching. Decreased branching increases the crystallinity as molecules
undergo internal folding, which leads to improved stiffness, tear strength, hardness, and chemical resistance.
Cross linking of PE produces a thermosetting polymer with a superior temperature rating, improved tensile
strength, and an enhanced resistance to partial discharges. Most of the PE used on extruded cables is of the
cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) type.
Ethylene–propylene rubber (EPR) is an amorphous elastomer, which is synthesized from ethylene and
propylene. As an extrudent on cables its composition has ﬁller contents up to 50%, comprising primarily clay,
with smaller amounts of added silicate and carbon black. The dielectric losses are appreciably enhanced by the
ﬁllers and, consequently, EPR is not suitable for extra-high-voltage applications, with its use being usually
conﬁned to lower and intermediate voltages (#138 kV) and also where high cable ﬂexibility due to its rubber-
like properties may be additionally desired.
Polypropylene has a structure related to that of ethylene with one added methyl group. It is a thermoplastic
material having properties similar to high-density PE, though due to its lower density, it has also a lower
dielectric constant. It has many electrical applications both in bulk form as in molded and extruded
insulations as well as in ﬁlm form in taped capacitor, transformer, and cable insulations.
Polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) or Teﬂon1* is a fully ﬂuorinated version of PE, having a repeat unit of
[–CF2–CF2–]. It is characterized by a low dielectric constant, extremely low losses, and has excellent
temperature stability and is resistive to chemical degradation. It has been extensively used in specialized
applications on insulators, wires and cables, transformers, motors, and generators. Its relatively high cost is
attributable to both the higher cost of the ﬂuorinated monomers as well as the specialized fabrication
techniques required.
Polyesters are obtained most commonly by reacting a dialcohol with a diester; they may be either
thermosetting or thermoplastic. The former are usually employed in glass laminates and glass ﬁber-reinforced
moldings, while thermoplastic polyesters are used for injection-molding applications. They are used in small
and large electrical apparatus as well as in electronic applications.
Polyimides (kaptons1*), as nylons1* (polyamides), have nitrogen in their molecular structure. They
constitute a class of high-temperature thermoplastics that may be exposed to continuous operation at 480–F.
When glass-reinforced, they may be exposed to temperatures as high as 700–F; they are used in molded,
extruded wire, and ﬁlm form.
Polycarbonates are thermoplastics that are closely related to polyesters. They are primarily employed in the
insulation of electrically powered tools and in the casings of electrical appliances. Polycarbonates may be either
compression- or injection-molded and extruded as ﬁlms or sheets.
Epoxy resins are prepared from an epoxide monomer. The ﬁrst step involves a reaction between two
co-monomers; in the subsequent step, the prepolymer is cured by means of a cross-linking agent. Epoxy resins are
characterized by low shrinkage and high mechanical strength; they may be reinforced with glass ﬁbers and mixed
with mica ﬂakes. Epoxy resins have many applications such as, for example, for insulation of bars in the stators of
rotating machines, solid-type transformers, and spacers for compressed-gas-insulated busbars and cables.
Silicone rubber is classiﬁed as an organic-inorganic elastomer, which is obtained from the polymerization of
organic siloxanes. They are composed of dimethyl-siloxane repeat units, (CH3)2SiO–, with the side groups
being methyl units. Fillers are added to obtain the desired silicone rubber compounds; cross–linking is carried

out with peroxides. Since no softeners and plasticizers are required, silicone rubbers are resistant to
embrittlement and may be employed for low-temperature applications down to 120–F. Continuous
operation is possible up to 500–F, with intermittent usage as high as 700–F.
Solid–Liquid Insulating Systems
Impregnated-paper insulation constitutes one of the earliest insulating systems employed in electrical power
apparatus and cables [22]. Although in some applications alternate solid- or compressed-gas insulating
systems are now being used, the impregnated-paper system still constitutes one of the most reliable insulating
systems available. Proper impregnation of the paper results in a cavity-free insulating system, thereby
eliminating the occurrence of partial discharges that may lead to deterioration and breakdown of the
insulating system. The cellulose structure of paper has a ﬁnite acidity content as well as a residual colloidal or
bound water, which is held by hydrogen bonds. Consequently, impregnated cellulose base papers are
characterized by somewhat more elevated tan d values on the order of 2 · 103 at 30 kV cm1. The liquid
impregnants employed are either mineral oils or synthetic ﬂuids. Since the dielectric constant of these ﬂuids is
normally about 2.2 and that of dried cellulose may extend from 6.5 to 10, the resulting dielectric constant of
the impregnated paper is approximately between 3.1 and 3.5.
Lower-densitycellulose papers have slightly lowerdielectric losses, but the dielectric breakdown strengthis also
reduced. The converse is true for impregnated systems, utilizing higher-density papers. The general chemical
formula of cellulose paper is C12H20O10. If the paper is heated beyond 200–C, the chemical structure of the paper
breaks down even in the absence of external oxygen, since the latter is readily available from within the cellulose
molecule. To avert this process from occurring, cellulose papers are ordinarily not used beyond 100–C.
In an attempt to reduce the dielectric losses in solid–liquid systems, cellulose papers have been substituted
in some applications by synthetic papers (c.f. Table 29.3). For example in extra-high-voltage cables, cellulose
paper-polypropylene composite tapes have been employed. A partial paper content in the composite tapes is
necessary both to retain some of the impregnation capability of a porous cellulose paper medium and to
maintain the relative ease of cellulose-to-cellulose tape sliding capability upon bending. In transformers the
synthetic nylon1 or polyamide paper (nomex1) is used both in ﬁlm and board form. It may be continuously
operated at temperatures up to 220–C.

permittivity. Note that when the SI system of units is employed, the ratio C/Co deﬁnes the real value of

Dielectric loss:
The rate at which the electrical energy supplied to a dielectric material by an alternating
electrical ﬁeld is changed to heat.
Dielectric strength:
Represents the value of the externally applied electric ﬁeld at which breakdown or failure
of the dielectric takes place. Unless a completely uniform ﬁeld gradient can be assured across
the dielectric specimen, the resulting breakdown value will be a function of the specimen thickness
and the test electrode geometry; this value will be substantially below that of the intrinsic breakdown
strength.
Dissipation factor (tan ddddd):
Equal to the tangent of the loss angle d, which is the phase angle between the
external electric ﬁeld vector and the resulting displacement vector D. It is numerically equal to the ratio
of the imaginary permittivity e0 0 to the real permittivity e0; alternatively, it is deﬁned by the ratio of the
leakage current to the displacement (charging or capacitive) current.

THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS in engineering deeply affect the lives of all of us and also serve to remind us of
the importance of mathematics. Interest in mathematics has grown steadily with these engineering
achievements and with concomitant advances in pure physical science. Whereas scholars in nonscientiﬁc
ﬁelds, and even in such ﬁelds as botany, medicine, geology, etc., can communicate most of the problems and
results in nonmathematical language, this is virtually impossible in present-day engineering and physics. Yet it
is interesting to note that until the beginning of the twentieth century, engineers regarded calculus as
something of a mystery. Modern students of engineering now study calculus, as well as differential equations,
complex variables, vector analysis, orthogonal functions, and a variety of other topics in applied analysis. The
study of systems has ushered in matrix algebra and, indeed, most engineering students now take linear algebra
as a core topic early in their mathematical education.
IV-1

This section contains concise summaries of relevant topics in applied engineering mathematics and certain
key formulas, that is, those formulas that are most often needed in the formulation and solution of
engineering problems. Whereas even inexpensive electronic calculators contain tabular material (e.g., tables of
trigonometric and logarithmic functions) that used to be needed in this kind of handbook, most calculators
do not give symbolic results. Hence, we have included formulas along with brief summaries that guide their
use. In many cases we have added numerical examples, as in the discussions of matrices, their inverses, and
their use in the solutions of linear systems. A table of derivatives is included, as well as key applications of the
derivative in the solution of problems in maxima and minima, related rates, analysis of curvature, and ﬁnding
approximate roots by numerical methods. A list of inﬁnite series, along with the interval of convergence of
each, is also included.
Of the two branches of calculus, integral calculus is richer in its applications, as well as in its theoretical
content. Though the theory is not emphasized here, important applications such as ﬁnding areas, lengths,
volumes, centroids, and the work done by a nonconstant force are included. Both cylindrical and spherical
polar coordinates are discussed, and a table of integrals is included. Vector analysis is summarized in a separate
section and includes a summary of the algebraic formulas involving dot and cross multiplication, frequently
needed in the study of ﬁelds, as well as the important theorems of Stokes and Gauss. The part on special
functions includes the gamma function, hyperbolic functions, Fourier series, orthogonal functions, and both
Laplace and z-transforms. The Laplace transform provides a basis for the solution of differential equations and
is fundamental to all concepts and deﬁnitions underlying analytical tools for describing feedback control
systems. The z-transform, not discussed in most applied mathematics books, is most useful in the analysis of
discrete signals as, for example, when a computer receives data sampled at some prespeciﬁed time interval. The
Bessel functions, also called cylindrical functions, arise in many physical applications, such as the heat transfer
in a ‘‘long’’ cylinder, whereas the other orthogonal functions discussed—Legendre, Hermite, and Laguerre
polynomials—are needed in quantum mechanics and many other subjects (e.g., solid-state electronics) that
use concepts of modern physics.
The world of mathematics, even applied mathematics, is vast. Even the best mathematicians cannot keep up
with more than a small piece of this world. The topics included in this section, however, have withstood the
test of time and, thus, are truly core for the modern engineer.
This section also incorporates tables of physical constants and symbols widely used by engineers. While not
exhaustive, the constants, conversion factors, and symbols provided will enable the reader to accommodate a
majority of the needs that arise in design, test, and manufacturing functions.

International System of Units (SI)
The International System of units (SI) was adopted by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures
(CGPM) in 1960. It is a coherent system of units built form seven SI base units, one for each of the seven
dimensionally independent base quantities: they are the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and
candela, for the dimensions length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of
substance, and luminous intensity, respectively. The deﬁnitions of the SI base units are given below. The SI
derived units are expressed as products of powers of the base units, analogous to the corresponding relations
between physical quantities but with numerical factors equal to unity.
In the International System there is only one SI unit for each physical quantity. This is either the appropriate
SI base unit itself or the appropriate SI derived unit. However, any of the approved decimal preﬁxes, called SI
preﬁxes, may be used to construct decimal multiples or submultiples of SI units.
It is recommended that only SI units be used in science and technology (with SI preﬁxes where
appropriate). Where there are special reasons for making an exception to this rule, it is recommended always
to deﬁne the units used in terms of SI units. This section is based on information supplied by IUPAC.
Deﬁnitions of SI Base Units
Meter: The meter is the length of path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458
of a second (17th CGPM, 1983).
Kilogram: The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the
kilogram (3rd CGPM, 1901).
Second: The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperﬁne levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom (13th CGPM, 1967).

Mathematics, Symbols, and Physical Constants

Ampere: The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of
inﬁnite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 m apart in vacuum, would produce between
these conductors a force equal to 2 · 107 newton per meter of length (9th CGPM, 1948).
Kelvin: The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic
temperature of the triple point of water (13th CGPM, 1967).
Mole: The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there
are atoms in 0.012 kg of carbon-12. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be speciﬁed and may
be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, or other particles or speciﬁed groups of such particles (14th CGPM,
1971).
Examples of the use of the mole:
1 mol of H2 contains about 6.022 · 1023 H2 molecules, or 12.044 · 1023 H atoms.
1 mol of HgCl has a mass of 236.04 g.
1 mol of Hg2Cl2 has a mass of 472.08 g.
1 mol of Hg2
2þ has a mass of 401.18 g and a charge of 192.97 kC.
1 mol of Fe0.91S has a mass of 82.88 g.
1 mol of e has a mass of 548.60 mg and a charge of 96.49 kC.
1 mol of photons whose frequency is 1014 Hz has energy of about 39.90 kJ.
Candela: The candela is the luminous intensity in a given direction of a source that emits monochromatic
radiation of frequency 540 · 1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of (1/683) watt per
steradian (16th CGPM, 1979).

1For radial (circular) frequency and for angular velocity the unit rad s1, or simply s1, should be used,
and this may not be simpliﬁed to Hz. The unit Hz should be used only for frequency in the sense of cycles
per second.
2The Celsius temperature y is deﬁned by the equation:
y=–C ¼ T=K  273:15
The SI unit of Celsius temperature interval is the degree Celsius, –C, which is equal to the kelvin, K. –C
should be treated as a single symbol, with no space between the – sign and the letter C. (The symbol –K and
the symbol – should no longer be used.)

1The a˚ngstrom and the bar are approved by CIPM for ‘‘temporary use with SI units,’’ until CIPM
makes a further recommendation. However, they should not be introduced where they are not used
at present.
2The values of these units in terms of the corresponding SI units are not exact, since they depend
on the values of the physical constants e (for the electronvolt) and Na (for the uniﬁed atomic mass
unit), which are determined by experiment.
3The uniﬁed atomic mass unit is also sometimes called the dalton, with symbol Da, although the
name and symbol have not been approved by CGPM.

Probability for Electrical and Computer Engineers
Charles W. Therrien
The Algebra of Events
The study of probability is based upon experiments that have uncertain outcomes. Collections of these
outcomes comprise events and the collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment comprise what is
called the sample space, denoted by S. Outcomes are members of the sample space and events of interest are
represented as sets of outcomes (see Figure IV.1).
The algebra A that deals with representing events is the usual set algebra. If A is an event, then Ac (the
complement of A) represents the event that ‘‘A did not occur.’’ The complement of the sample space is the
null event, ; ¼ Sc. The event that both event A1 and event A2 have occurred is the intersection, written as
‘‘A1·A2’’ or ‘‘A1A2’’ while the event that either A1 or A2 or both have occurred is the union, written as
‘‘A1 þ A2.’’1
Table IV.1 lists the two postulates that deﬁne the algebra A, while Table IV.2 lists seven axioms that
deﬁne properties of its operations. Together these tables can be used to show all of the properties of the
algebra of events. Table IV.3 lists some additional useful relations that can be derived from the axioms
and the postulates.
Since the events ‘‘A1 þ A2’’ and ‘‘A1A2’’ are included in the algebra, it follows by induction that for any ﬁnite
number of events A1 þ A2 þ    þ AN and A1·A2     AN are also included in the algebra. Since
problems often involve the union or intersection of an inﬁnite number of events, however, the algebra of events
must be deﬁned to include these inﬁnite intersections and unions. This extension to inﬁnite unions and
intersections is known as a sigma algebra.
A set of events that satisﬁes the two conditions:
1. AiAj ¼ ; 6¼ for 6¼ i 6¼ j
2. A1 þ A2 þ A3 þ    ¼ S
is known as a partition and is important for the solution of problems in probability. The events of a
partition
are
said
to
be
mutually
exclusive
and
collectively
exhaustive.
The
most
fundamental
partition is the set outcomes deﬁning the random experiment, which comprise the sample space by
deﬁnition.
Probability
Probability measures the likelihood of occurrence of events represented on a scale of 0 to 1. We often estimate
probability by measuring the relative frequency of an event, which is deﬁned as
relative frequency ¼
number of occurrences of the event
number of repetitions of the experiment
(for a large number of repetitions). Probability can be deﬁned formally by the following axioms:
(I) The probability of any event is nonnegative:
Pr½A	 > 0
ðIV:1Þ
(II) The probability of the universal event (i.e., the entire sample space) is 1:
Pr½S	 ¼ 1
ðIV:2Þ
1Some authors use ˙ and ¨ rather than · and þ, respectively.
IV-14
Mathematics, Symbols, and Physical Constants

(III) If A1 and A2 are mutually exclusive, i.e., A1A2 ¼ ;, then
Pr½A1 þ A2	 ¼ Pr½A1	 þ Pr½A2	
ðIV:3Þ
(IV) If fAig represent a countably inﬁnite set of mutually exclusive events, then
Pr½A1 þ A2 þ A3 þ   	 ¼
X
1
i¼1
Pr½Ai	
ð if AiAj ¼ ;
i 6¼ jÞ
ðIV:4Þ
Note that although the additivity of probability for any ﬁnite set of disjoint events follows from (III), the
property has to be stated explicitly for an inﬁnite set in (IV). These axioms and the algebra of events can
be used to show a number of other important properties which are summarized in Table IV.4. The last
item in the table is an especially important formula since it uses probabilistic information about

individual events to compute the probability of the union of two events. The term Pr½A1A2	 is referred to
as the joint probability of the two events. This last equation shows that the probabilities of two events add
as in Equation (IV.3) only if their joint probability is 0. The joint probability is 0 when the two events
have no intersection (A1A2 ¼ ;).
Two events are said to be statistically independent if and only if
Pr½A1A2	 ¼ Pr½A1	·Pr½A2	
ðindependent eventsÞ
ðIV:5Þ
This deﬁnition is not derived from the earlier properties of probability. An argument to give this deﬁnition
intuitive meaning can be found in Ref. [1]. Independence occurs in problems where two events are not
inﬂuenced by one another and Equation (IV.5) simpliﬁes such problems considerably.
A ﬁnal important result deals with partitions. A partition is a ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite set of
events A1; A2; A3; . . . that satisfy the two conditions:
AiAj ¼ ; for i 6¼ j
A1 þ A2 þ A3 þ    ¼ S
The events in a partition satisfy the relation:
X
i
Pr½Ai	 ¼ 1
ðIV:6Þ
Further, if B is any other event, then
Pr½B	 ¼
X
i
Pr½AiB	
ðIV:7Þ
The latter result is referred to as the principle of total probability and is frequently used in solving
problems. The principle is illustrated by a Venn diagram in Figure IV.2. The rectangle represents the
sample space and other events are deﬁned therein. The event B is seen to be comprised of all of the pieces

that represent intersections or overlap of event B with the events Ai. This is the graphical interpretation of
Equation (IV.7).
An Example
Simon’s Surplus Warehouse has large barrels of mixed electronic components (parts) that you can buy by the
handful or by the pound. You are not allowed to select parts individually. Based on your previous experience,
you have determined that in one barrel, 29% of the parts are bad (faulted), 3% are bad resistors, 12% are good
resistors, 5% are bad capacitors, and 32% are diodes. You decide to assign probabilities based on these
percentages. Let us deﬁne the following events:
A Venn diagram representing this situation is shown below along with probabilities of various events as
given:
R
C
D
G
B
Pr[B] = 0.29
Pr[BR] = 0.03
Pr[GR] = 0.12
Pr[BC] = 0.05
Pr[D] = 0.32
Note that since any component must be a resistor, capacitor, or diode, the region labeled D in the diagram
represents everything in the sample space which is not included in R or C.
We can answer a number of questions.
1. What is the probability that a component is a resistor (either good or bad)?
Since the events B and G form a partition of the sample space, we can use the principle of total
probability Equation (IV.7) to write:
Pr½R	 ¼ Pr½GR	 þ Pr½BR	 ¼ 0:12 þ 0:03 ¼ 0:15
2. Are bad parts and resistors independent?
We know that Pr½BR	 ¼ 0:03 and we can compute:
Pr½B	 · Pr½R	 ¼ ð0:29Þð0:15Þ ¼ 0:0435
Since Pr½BR	 6¼ Pr½B	 · Pr½R	, the events are not independent.
3. You have no use for either bad parts or resistors. What is the probability that a part is either bad and/or
a resistor?

Using the formula from Table IV.4 and the previous result we can write:
Pr½B þ R	 ¼ Pr½B	 þ Pr½R	  Pr½BR	 ¼ 0:29 þ 0:15  0:03 ¼ 0:41
4. What is the probability that a part is useful to you?
Let U represent the event that the part is useful. Then (see Table IV.4):
Pr½U	 ¼ 1  Pr½Uc	 ¼ 1  0:41 ¼ 0:59
5. What is the probability of a bad diode?
Observe that the events R, C, and D form a partition, since a component has to be one and only one
type of part. Then using Equation (IV.7) we write:
Pr½B	 ¼ Pr½BR	 þ Pr½BC	 þ Pr½BD	
Substituting the known numerical values and solving yields
0:29 ¼ 0:03 þ 0:05 þ Pr½BD	 or Pr½BD	 ¼ 0:21
Conditional Probability and Bayes’ Rule
The conditional probability of an event A1 given that an event A2 has occurred is deﬁned by
Pr½A1jA2	 ¼ Pr½A1A2	
Pr½A2	
ðIV:8Þ
(Pr½A1jA2	 is read ‘‘probability of A1 given A2.’’) As an illustration, let us compute the probability that a
component in the previous example is bad given that it is a resistor:
Pr½BjR	 ¼ Pr½BR	
Pr½R	 ¼ 0:03
0:15 ¼ 0:2
(The value for Pr[R] was computed in question 1 of the example.) Frequently the statement of a
problem is in terms of conditional probability rather than joint probability, so Equation (IV.8) is used
in the form:
Pr½A1A2	 ¼ Pr½A1jA2	 · Pr½A2	 ¼ Pr½A2jA1	 · Pr½A1	
ðIV:9Þ
(The last expression follows because Pr½A1A2	 and Pr½A2A1	 are the same thing.) Using this result, the
principle of total probability Equation (IV.7) can be rewritten as
Pr½B	 ¼
X
j
Pr½BjAj	 Pr½Aj	
ðIV:10Þ
where B is any event and fAjg is a set of events that forms a partition.
Now, consider any one of the events Ai in the partition. It follows from Equation (IV.9) that
Pr½AijB	 ¼ Pr½BjAi	 · Pr½Ai	
Pr½B	
IV-18
Mathematics, Symbols, and Physical Constants

Then substituting in Equation (IV.10) yields:
Pr½AijB	 ¼ Pr½BjAi	 · Pr½Ai	
P
j Pr½BjAj	 Pr½Aj	
ðIV:11Þ
This result is known as Baye’s theorem or Bayes’ rule. It is used in a number of problems that commonly arise
in electrical engineering. We illustrate and end this section with an example from the ﬁeld of communications.

where we use notation like 0S, 0R . . . to denote events ‘‘0 sent,’’ ‘‘0 received,’’ etc. When a 0 is transmitted, it is
correctly received with probability 0.95 or incorrectly received with probability 0.05. That is, Pr½0Rj0S	 ¼ 0:95
and Pr½1Rj0S	 ¼ 0:05. When a 1 is transmitted, it is correctly received with probability 0.90 and incorrectly
received with probability 0.10. The probabilities of sending a 0 or a 1 are denoted by Pr½0S	 and Pr½1S	. It is
desired to compute the probability of error for the system.
This is an application of the principle of total probability. The two events 0S and 1S are mutually exclusive
and collectively exhaustive and thus form a partition. Take the event B to be the event that an error occurs. It
follows from Equation (IV.10) that
Pr[error] ¼ Pr[errorj0S	 Pr½0S	 þ Pr[errorj1S	 Pr½1S	
¼ Pr½1Rj0S	Pr½0S	 þ Pr½0Rj1S	 Pr½1S	
¼ ð0:05Þ ð0:5Þ þ ð0:10Þ ð0:5Þ ¼ 0:075
Next, given that an error has occurred, let us compute the probability that a 1 was sent or a 0 was sent. This is
an application of Bayes’ rule. For a 1, Equation (IV.11) becomes
Pr½1Sjerror	 ¼
Pr½errorj1S	 Pr½1S	
Pr½errorj1S	 Pr½1S	 þ Pr½errorj0S	 Pr½0S	
Substituting the numerical values then yields:
Pr½1Sjerror	 ¼
ð0:10Þð0:5Þ
ð0:10Þð0:5Þ þ ð0:05Þð0:5Þ < 0:667

Mathematics, Symbols, and Physical Constants

For a 0, a similar analysis applies:
Pr½0Sjerror	 ¼
Pr½errorj0S	 Pr½0S	
Pr½errorj1S	 Pr½1S	 þ Pr½errorj0S	 Pr½0S	
¼
ð0:05Þð0:5Þ
ð0:10Þð0:5Þ þ ð0:05Þð0:5Þ < 0:333
The two resulting probabilities sum to 1 because 0S and 1S form a partition for the experiment.
