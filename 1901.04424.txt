We present the amplitude for classical scattering of gravitationally interacting massive scalars at
third post-Minkowskian order. Our approach harnesses powerful tools from the modern amplitudes
program such as generalized unitarity and the double-copy construction, which relates gravity inte-
grands to simpler gauge-theory expressions. Adapting methods for integration and matching from
eﬀective ﬁeld theory, we extract the conservative Hamiltonian for compact spinless binaries at third
post-Minkowskian order. The resulting Hamiltonian is in complete agreement with corresponding
terms in state-of-the-art expressions at fourth post-Newtonian order as well as the probe limit at
all orders in velocity. We also derive the scattering angle at third post-Minkowskian order.
Introduction. The recent discovery of gravitational waves
at LIGO/Virgo [1] has launched an extraordinary new
era in multi-messenger astronomy. Given expected im-
provements in detector sensitivity, high-precision theo-
retical predictions from general relativity will be crucial.
Existing theory benchmarks come from a variety of ap-
proaches (see also Ref. [2] and references therein), in-
cluding the eﬀective one-body formalism [3], numerical
relativity [4], the self-force formalism [5], and pertur-
bative analysis using post-Newtonian (PN) [6–9], post-
Minkowskian (PM) [10–12], and eﬀective ﬁeld theory
(EFT) [13] methods.
The past decade has also witnessed immense progress
in the study of scattering amplitudes, where under-
standing mathematical structures within gauge theory
and gravity has yielded new physical insights and eﬃ-
cient methods for calculation. In particular, the Bern-
Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) color-kinematics duality and
associated double copy construction [14] allow multiloop
gravitational amplitudes to be constructed from sums of
products of gauge-theory quantities. This has yielded a
variety of new results in supergravity (see Ref. [15] for
recent results). The BCJ construction is intimately tied
to the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations [16], which
relate tree amplitudes of closed and open strings.
In this paper, we apply modern amplitude methods
to derive the classical scattering amplitude for two mas-
sive spinless particles at O(G3) and to all orders in the
velocity, i.e. at the third post-Minkowskian (3PM) or-
der. We use generalized unitarity [17] to construct the
corresponding two-loop integrand from tree amplitudes
of gravitons and massive scalars, obtained straightfor-
wardly from the double-copy construction.
While the
double copy introduces dilaton and antisymmetric tensor
degrees of freedom [18] which are absent in pure Einstein
gravity, we remove these unwanted states eﬃciently by
restricting the state sums in unitarity cuts to gravitons
alone. As we will show, we can calculate in strictly D = 4
dimensions for the classical dynamics, where spinor he-
licity variables [19, 20] dramatically simplify the required
tree amplitudes. The viability of working in D = 4 oﬀers
optimism for extending our results to higher orders.
Afterwards, we integrate the two-loop integrand via
a procedure adapted from EFT, in which energy inte-
grals are evaluated in the potential region via residues
before performing spatial integrations [21]. Using EFT
matching [21, 22] we then derive the 3PM conservative
Hamiltonian for compact spinless binaries. We show that
the 4PN terms in our Hamiltonian are, up to a coordi-
nate transformation, physically equivalent to correspond-
ing terms in state-of-the-art results. We also verify that
our result agrees in the probe limit with the Hamiltonian
for a test body orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole to
3PM order. Finally, we derive a compact expression for
the 3PM scattering angle in terms of amplitude data.
Double copy and unitarity. Dynamics at 3PM order is en-
coded in the two-loop scattering amplitude for two mas-
sive, gravitationally interacting scalars. Our calculation
begins with a construction of the corresponding two-loop
integrand via generalized unitarity. Because we are inter-
ested in classical scattering, we need not assemble the full
quantum-mechanical integrand. Rather, as emphasized
in Refs. [21–23], the classical potential only receives con-
tributions with a single on-shell matter line per loop and
with no gravitons starting and ending on the same mat-
ter line. For this reason we focus solely on the unitarity
cuts shown in Fig. 1.
We obtain the tree amplitudes in the unitarity cuts via
two methods. In the ﬁrst approach, we work in general D
space-time dimensions. Exploiting color-kinematics du-
ality [14], we derive gravitational amplitudes straightfor-
wardly from simpler gauge-theory amplitudes by replac-
ing color factors with corresponding kinematic factors.
For the unitarity cuts of the classical limit of the two-loop
scattering amplitude, the reference momenta that com-
plicate projection onto graviton physical states can be
eliminated, simplifying the calculation [24]. The primary
purpose of our D-dimensional construction is to conﬁrm

explicitly the completeness of our second method, where
we work in strictly D = 4 so as to beneﬁt from very
simple expressions for gauge-theory amplitudes in terms
of spinor helicity [19] variables. We then build the two
corresponding gravitational amplitudes via the KLT re-
lations [16]. At two loops, both approaches are eﬃcient,
but at higher loops, helicity amplitudes oﬀer a much more
compact starting point.
For concreteness, consider the ﬁrst generalized unitar-
ity cut in Fig. 1, which we refer to as CH-cut and is com-
prised of products of four three-point and one four-point
amplitudes. Since four-point tree amplitudes are already
very simple there is little computational advantage to
imposing the on-shell conditions on matter lines. Thus,
we replace the pairs of three-point amplitudes at the top
and bottom of the cut with four-point amplitudes and
then impose the matter cut conditions at the end. The
resulting iterated two-particle cut is then
C2,2 =
X
states
M4(2s, −8, 7, 3s)M4(−5, 6, −7, 8)
× M4(1s, 5, −6, 4s),
(1)
where M4 denotes the tree-level four-point amplitude for
gravity minimally coupled to two massive scalars denoted
here by legs 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s. In this cut, legs 1s, 4s have
mass m1 while legs 2s, 3s have mass m2. All momenta in
each tree amplitude are taken to be outgoing. The sum
runs over graviton states for legs 5, 6, 7, 8, where the
minus signs on the labels indicate reversed momenta.
The four-point gravity tree amplitudes needed in the
cuts are obtained from gauge-theory ones via the ﬁeld-
theory limit of KLT relations [16],
M4(1, 2, 3, 4) = −is12A4(1, 2, 3, 4) A4(1, 2, 4, 3),
(2)
where the A4 are tree-level color-ordered gauge-theory
four-point amplitudes and sij = (pi + pj)2, working
in mostly minus metric signature throughout. Strictly
speaking, the KLT relations apply only to massless
states. However, they can be applied here by interpreting
the scalar masses, in the sense of dimensional reduction,
as extra-dimensional momentum components. While we
have not included coupling constants, these are easily
restored at the end of the calculation by including an
overall factor of (8πG)3, where G is Newton’s constant.
In terms of the spinor-helicity conventions of Ref. [20],
the
independent
tree-level
gauge-theory
amplitudes
needed in Eq. (1) are

A4(1−, 2+, 3−, 4+) = i
⟨1 3⟩4
⟨1 2⟩⟨2 3⟩⟨3 4⟩⟨4 1⟩,
(3)
where tij = 2pi · pj and the ± denote gluon helicities.
The dilaton and antisymmetric tensor states are re-
moved from unitarity cuts by correlating the gluon helic-
ities on both sides of the double copy.
The unwanted
states correspond to one gluon in the double copy of
positive helicity and the other of negative helicity. An
internal graviton state is obtained by taking the corre-
sponding gluons in the KLT formula in Eq. (2) to be of
the same helicity.
Using spinor evaluation techniques, it is straightfor-
ward to obtain a compact expression for the iterated two-
particle cut in Eq. (1) (e.g. see Ref. [25]). Imposing cuts
on the matter lines, as indicated in the ﬁrst unitarity cut
of Fig. 1, further simpliﬁes it and gives CH-cut. We ﬁnd

The simplicity of this expression is a reﬂection of the
double-copy structure: the same building blocks appear
in the simpler corresponding gauge-theory cut.
The spurious double-pole in s23 can be explicitly can-
celled by adding terms proportional to the Gram determi-
nant formed from the ﬁve independent momenta at two
loops which vanishes in D = 4. In fact, the expression de-
rived from the D-dimensional approach is automatically
free of such spurious singularities.
While these Gram
determinants contribute quantum mechanically, we have
checked explicitly that they vanish in the classical limit.
This is not accidental—such terms are of the wrong form
to generate the required log(s23) needed to contribute to
the classical 3PM amplitude (see Ref. [24] for details).
The remaining two independent generalized unitarity
cuts in Fig. 2 are more complicated because they re-
quire ﬁve-point tree amplitudes with two massive scalar
legs.
The four-dimensional input gauge-theory ampli-
tudes are simple to compute using modern methods

FIG. 2. The eight independent diagrams showing the propa-
gator structure of integrals from which the classical contribu-
tions are extracted.
(e.g. see Ref. [26]). For our D construction we obtain
a BCJ representation, allowing us to express the gravity
cuts directly in terms of local diagrams. The particular
representation was chosen such that we can ignore the ref-
erence momenta when projecting the internal states into
gravitons. Further details will be given elsewhere [24].
To facilitate integration, we merge the cuts into a sin-
gle integrand whose cuts match those in Fig. 1. This is
achieved using an ansatz in terms of eight independent
diagrams with only cubic vertices displayed in Fig. 2. The
diagrammatic numerators are polynomials of the appro-
priate dimension exhibiting the symmetries of the corre-
sponding diagram. Their coeﬃcients are then ﬁxed via
the method of maximal cuts [27], whereby cuts of the in-
tegrand are constrained to match the known ones. This
approach is suﬃcient for the two-loop problem.
Integration. Our method of integration follows Ref. [21].
For convenience, we give a short summary here, leaving
details to Ref. [24]. Terms in the integrand take the form,

(6)
where i labels each matter line, which has energy ωi,
spatial momentum ki, and mass mi. The matter prop-
agators can be factored into particle and antiparticle
poles, ωi ±

i . We then express the integrand
as I = N × Q
i

zi , i.e. in terms of the particle poles
zi = ωi −
p

i + m2
i and an eﬀective numerator N which
absorbs the rest of the integrand.
Following the procedure outlined in Ref. [21], we ﬁrst
evaluate the energy integrals.
At two loops, i.e. 3PM
order, we integrate over two independent combinations
of energies, ω and ω′, in the potential region. As we will
prove in detail in Ref. [24], the result is
eI =
Z dω
2π
dω′
2π I(ω, ω′) =
X
(i,j)
Sij Res
ωij,ω′
ij
I(ω, ω′),
(7)
where the sum runs over distinct pairings (i, j) of matter
poles and zi = zj = 0 when (ω, ω′) = (ωij, ω′
ij). Here Sij
is a calculable symmetry factor whose sign and magni-
tude depend on the topology of the cut graph. Note that
the residue for an (i, j) pairing will vanish if there are no
values of ω and ω′ for which zi = zj = 0.
The resulting quantity eI depends on two independent
spatial loop momenta. To integrate over them we em-
ploy dimensional regularization to deal with ultraviolet
divergences stemming from the renormalization of delta
function contact interactions which do not contribute
classically. Due to the localization on energy residues,
eI is a complicated, non-polynomial function of three-
dimensional invariants involving square roots. Neverthe-
less, we can series expand eI in large m1,2, yielding poly-
nomials of kinematic invariants which we can integrate
at each order.
After expanding, nearly all the spatial
integrals are simple bubbles for which there are known
analytic expressions [28].
The remaining integrals are
evaluated via integration-by-parts identities [29].
For diagrams free from infrared (IR) singularities gen-
erated by iterations of lower-loop graviton exchanges, we
have checked that our integrated results accord with sev-
eral standard methods in the Feynman integral litera-
ture, including the Mellin-Barnes representation [28, 30],
numerical integration via sector decomposition [31], and
diﬀerential equations [32] derived through integration-by-
parts reduction [29, 33]. Since the classical contribution
comes from certain residues on matter poles, the system
of diﬀerential equations omits integrals without support
on such residues.
Amplitude and potential. We apply the integration pro-
cedure outlined above order by order in the large-mass
expansion, i.e. in powers of velocity. Combining an ex-
plicit evaluation of the 3PM amplitude up to 7PN order
with information on the pole structure of individual in-
tegrals and exact, manifestly relativistic analytic results
for certain graph topologies, we conjecture a full, all or-
ders in velocity expression for the 3PM amplitude (whose
uniqueness will be discussed in Ref. [24]):

The Hamiltonian is extracted from the amplitude via

comes from diagrams with two or fewer loops that de-

ity. Inserting these into M(EFT)

the subtraction of iterated contributions. By equating

where for convenience, the expressions for c1 and c2 in
Ref. [21] are reproduced here with slightly diﬀerent nor-
malization and in our current notation. As emphasized
in Ref. [21], the cancellation of IR divergences between
M(EFT)
3
and M3 depends critically on c1 and c2 and thus
provides a nontrivial check of our calculation.
Consistency checks. Our results pass several nontrivial
albeit overlapping consistency checks (see Ref. [24] for
details). First and foremost, we have veriﬁed that the
4PN terms in our Hamiltonian are equivalent to known
results up to a canonical coordinate transformation,
(r, p) →(R, P ) = (A r + B p, C p + D r)
A = 1 −Gmν
2|r| + · · · ,
B = G(1 −2/ν)
4m|r|
p · r + · · · ,
C = 1 + Gmν
2|r| + · · · ,
D = −Gmν
2|r|3 p · r + · · · ,
(11)
with ellipses denoting higher order corrections entering
as a power series in G/|r|, p2, and (p · r)2/r2 (for past
treatments, see Ref. [35, 36]). To derive this coordinate
transformation we generate an ansatz for A, B, C, D and
constrain it to preserve the Poisson brackets, i.e. {r, p} =
{R, P } = 1 with all other brackets vanishing, in the
spirit of Ref. [37]. We verify that within this space of
canonical transformations exists a subspace which maps
our Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) to the one in the literature,
e.g. as summarized in Eq.(8.41) of Ref. [9], up to the
intersection of 3PM and 4PN accuracy.
Second, applying the methods of Ref. [21] we have
checked that the full-theory amplitude M3 in Eq. (8)
is identical to the amplitude M(EFT)
3
computed from the
conservative Hamiltonian in Ref. [9] up to 4PN accuracy.
Third, we have extracted from our Hamiltonian the
coordinate invariant energy of a circular orbit as a func-
tion of the period. Working at 2PN order—the highest
order subsumed by 3PM which is relevant to a virialized
system—we agree with known results [8].

Fourth, we have extracted from our Hamiltonian the
3PM-accurate classical scattering angle in the center-of-
mass frame, given by

where J = b|p| is the angular momentum, b is the impact

1/|p|,
d2 = mγξ|q|M′
2, and d3 = mγξ|p|M′
3/ log q2.
The
primed quantities denote the IR-ﬁnite parts of the nonrel-
ativistically normalized amplitudes that enter the Hamil-
tonian coeﬃcients as deﬁned here and in Ref. [21], so

and M′
3 is the log q2 term in Eq. (8). Truncated to 4PN
order, Eq. (12) agrees with known results [38].
Last but not least, in the probe limit m1 ≪m2, our
result exactly coincides with the Hamiltonian for a point
particle in a Schwarzschild background to O(G3) and all
orders in velocity, e.g. as given in Eq.(8) of Ref. [39].
Conclusions. We have presented the 3PM amplitude for
classical scattering of gravitationally interacting massive
spinless particles. From this amplitude we have extracted
the corresponding conservative Hamiltonian for binary
dynamics to 3PM order.
The 3PM Hamiltonian in Eqs. (9) and (10) will be em-
ployed in a forthcoming paper [40] to compute approx-
imants for the binding energy of binary systems mov-
ing on circular orbits and assess their accuracy against
numerical-relativity predictions.
This is relevant for
understanding the usefulness of PM calculations when
building accurate waveform models for LIGO/Virgo data
analysis.
Our paper leaves many avenues for future work, e.g. in-
cluding obtaining higher orders in the PM expansion, in-
corporating spin [41], radiation [42], and ﬁnite-size ef-
fects, as well as connecting to other recent amplitude
approaches [18, 43] and the eﬀective one-body formal-
ism [3, 11, 12, 44].
The simplicity of the 3PM amplitude in Eq. (8) and po-
tential in Eq. (10) bodes well for future progress. More-
over, since the amplitude and EFT methods employed in
this paper are far from exhausted, we believe that the
results we have reported mark only the beginning.
