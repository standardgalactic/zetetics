About Engineering is Elementary
Engineering is Elementary® (EiE) fosters engineering and technological literacy among 
children. Most humans spend over 95% of their time interacting with technology. Pencils, 
chairs, water filters, toothbrushes, cell phones, and buildings are all technologies—
solutions designed by engineers to fulfill human needs or wants. To understand the 
world we live in, it is vital that we foster engineering and technological literacy among 
all people, even young children! Fortunately, children are born engineers. They are 
fascinated with building, taking things apart, and how things work. Engineering is 
Elementary harnesses children’s natural curiosity to promote the learning of engineering 
and technology concepts.
The EiE program has four primary goals: 
Goal 1: Increase children’s technological literacy.
Goal 2: Increase educators’ abilities to teach engineering and technology.
Goal 3: Increase the number of schools and out-of-school time (OST) programs in the 
U.S. that include engineering.
Goal 4: Conduct research and assessment to further the first three goals and contribute 
knowledge about engineering teaching and learning.
The first product developed by the EiE program was the Engineering is Elementary 
curriculum series. Designed for use in elementary school classrooms, this curriculum 
is hands-on, research-based, standards-driven, and classroom-tested. For more 
information about EiE, visit: www.eie.org.
In 2011, EiE began development of Engineering Adventures (EA), a curriculum created 
for 3rd-5th grade children in OST environments. EA is designed to provide engaging and 
thought-provoking challenges appropriate for the OST setting. More information about 
EA can be found online at: www.engineeringadventures.org. 
In 2012 the Engineering Everywhere (EE) curriculum was created. EE is designed to 
empower middle school-aged children in OST settings to become engineers and solve 
problems that are personally meaningful and globally relevant. For more information, 
visit: www.engineeringeverywhere.org.
EiE is a part of The National Center for Technological Literacy (NCTL) at the Museum of 
Science, Boston. The NCTL aims to enhance knowledge of technology and inspire the 
next generation of engineers, inventors, and innovators. Unique in recognizing that a 
21st century curriculum must include today’s human-made world, the NCTL’s goal is to 
introduce engineering as early as elementary school and continue through high school, 
college, and beyond. For more information, visit: www.nctl.org.

About Engineering Adventures
The mission of Engineering Adventures (EA) is to create exciting out-of-school time 
activities and experiences that allow all 3rd-5th grade learners to act as engineers and 
engage in the engineering design process. Our goal is to positively impact children’s 
attitudes about their abilities to engineer by providing materials uniquely appropriate for 
the varied landscapes of out-of-school time settings.  
The main ideas that guide the developers of EA are listed below.
We believe kids will best learn engineering when they:
•	
engage in activities that are fun, exciting, and connect to the world in which they live.
•	
choose their path through open-ended challenges that have multiple solutions.
•	
have the opportunity to succeed in engineering challenges.
•	
communicate and collaborate in innovative, active, problem solving.
Through EA units, kids will learn that:
•	
they can use the Engineering Design Process to help solve problems.
•	
engineers design technologies to help people and solve problems.
•	
they have talent and potential for designing and improving technologies.
•	
they, too, are engineers.
As kids work through their engineering design challenges, they will have the opportunity 
to build problem solving, teamwork, communication, and creative thinking skills. Most 
importantly, this curriculum is designed to provide a fun learning opportunity for kids!

The Engineering Design Process
The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is the backbone of each Engineering 
Adventures (EA) unit. It is a five step process that guides kids in solving engineering 
challenges. Our goal for each EA unit is for kids to understand the EDP can not only help 
them solve problems in engineering but also in other areas of their lives.
While there are many other versions of the EDP that are used in academic and 
professional settings, the EiE team developed a five step process that is accessible for 
elementary school kids. India and Jacob, a fictional world-traveling brother and sister 
duo, introduce and guide kids through the Engineering Design Process in each unit. 
There are also questions for the educator to ask and sections in the Engineering Journal 
to provide an opportunity for kids to reflect on and discuss the process.
The EDP begins with the goal; the engineering challenge kids are asked to solve. The 
process is cyclical and flexible, kids can start a challenge at any step and may jump 
around to steps as they are engineering. For example, it is very common for kids to be 
creating their technology, but then ask questions about materials and imagine new ways 
to improve their design. In EA units, kids generally start with the ask step, then have time 
to imagine and plan their designs, then create and improve their technologies. 
To further highlight the EDP throughout the unit, the steps are italicized in the guide. 
Below is the Engineering Design Process used in the Engineering Adventures units.

Each Engineering Adventure Includes
A Message from the Duo, India and Jacob. 
We recommend presenting the audio 
versions of the messages, but paper copies 
are included as emails in each adventure and 
in kids’ journals. 

x
Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza

Messages from the Duo
Messages from India and Jacob, a fictional world-traveling brother and 
sister duo, are provided as a quick, exciting way to present the real-world 
context for the unit’s engineering challenge. Providing a context helps kids to 
understand the challenge and motivates them to find solutions. If you have 
access to a CD, MP3 player, or iOS device, we strongly suggest using the 
audio recordings, although reading the emails aloud will convey the same 
information. 
Set the Stage (Ask)
The Set the Stage, or Ask, part of each adventure provides important 
information and questions that prepare kids for the main activity. During 
this section, you might ask questions prompting kids to share their prior 
knowledge, have them predict what they will find, or remind them of criteria 
that will help them as they engineer. This sets your kids up to succeed and 
feel confident in their ability to engineer.
Activities
The activities are designed to get kids thinking and working together to 
solve the unit’s engineering design challenge. As the educator, it is your 
role to guide kids through these activities by encouraging them to pursue 
and communicate their own ideas, even if you think they may not work. In 
engineering, there are no right or wrong answers! Every problem has many 
possible solutions and multiple ways to reach them.
Reflect
Each adventure includes 5-10 minutes at the end for kids to communicate 
with their peers by sharing their work. This gives kids the chance to 
discuss new ideas, think about their own work and the work of others, and 
reflect on what was learned. Group reflection can help reduce competition 
by encouraging kids to support each other as they move through the 
Engineering Design Process. For more individual reflection, each adventure 
also includes time for kids to record thoughts and ideas in their Engineering 
Journal. 
The Sections of the Adventures

xi
Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza

Engineering Journals
Make a copy of the Engineering Journal for each kid as you begin 
working on this EA unit. The Engineering Journal is a central 
location for kids to record their thoughts and ideas as they move 
through the unit. It includes recording pages that will guide kids 
through the Engineering Design Process, poses questions, and 
prompts kids to reflect on their learning. The 5-10 minutes kids 
spend with their journals during each adventure will allow them to 
create a personalized record of their engineering learning. 
There are a few ways you can use the Engineering Journal. 
You may want to have groups share one Engineering Journal 
as a central recording spot for all group data and findings. This allows group members 
who enjoy writing and recording to do so. You may also encourage groups to share the 
responsibility by having group members rotate who records for each adventure.

What You Need to Know Before Teaching an EA Unit
Engineering is fun.
The EA team hears this from many OST educators and kids. Engineering is really a way 
of problem solving—a way of thinking about the world—that is often very fun and creative. 
Any time you need to solve a problem in order to reach a goal, you are engineering. 
There are no right or wrong answers.
There are often many great ways to solve the same problem. Not only is this a good 
engineering lesson for the kids in your program, it is a good life lesson.
It is okay to try it out!
It can be very helpful to try out the engineering challenge yourself—either beforehand or 
right alongside the kids in your program as they work through the adventures. This can 
help you understand the challenges the kids might face. 
Scheduling the Adventures
Each adventure requires 45-60 minutes of teaching time. We recommend that you budget 
at least 6-8 hours in order to complete this unit, as some adventures may occasionally go 
longer than expected. 

xiii

Tips for Teaching the Unit
Post a Daily Agenda
Giving kids a sense of the day’s adventure will help them to plan ahead and manage their 
time during the activity.
Facilitate Teamwork
Being able to work well in teams is an important skill for any engineer. You may want to 
assign team roles to help kids if they struggle with teamwork. Possible roles include: the 
recorder, the materials gatherer, the tester, and the presenter. 
Timing
As groups are working, call out regular time intervals so kids know how much time they 
have left to complete their task. This is especially helpful if kids have more than 20 
minutes to work on a task. Letting them know when five minutes increments have passed 
will allow them to budget their time and reassess where they are in their design. 

xiv
Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza

Mobile Apps
Mobile apps can be a fun way to engage kids in out-of-school time environments. The 
Engineering Adventures team has created iOS apps (compatible with most iPhones, iPod 
Touches, and iPads) that are designed to supplement the hands-on engineering experiences 
that your program provides.
You can download Engineering Adventures apps onto your personal device or devices that 
belong to your site. You may also choose to encourage kids to download the apps onto 
their devices, so they may continue to practice their engineering skills on their own time. 
Encourage them to receive permission from parents before doing so.
Messages from the Duo
The Messages from the Duo app is a new way for kids to listen to the audio 
communications from India and Jacob at the beginning of each adventure. 
Kids can use the scanner function in the app to scan the QR code at 
the top of each Message from the Duo page in the Engineering Journal. 
The audio of the message will play automatically as if India and Jacob 
are communicating directly to the kids over walkie-talkie! The app gives 
kids an opportunity to listen to the messages on their own for enhanced 
comprehension or to share with others. Educators may also choose to use the app as an 
alternative to a CD player or reading the messages aloud.

Background
Materials Engineering
Materials engineers are people who use their understanding of different materials (such 
as metals, plastics, or woods) to make things that solve problems. As part of their work, 
materials engineers explore the properties of different materials to help them choose which 
material will work best to solve the problem. 
In this unit, kids experiment with many different materials that can be used to make bubble 
wands. They become materials engineers as they consider which materials are best for 
making different kinds of bubbles, and which combination of materials they will use to create 
their own unique bubble wands.
Bubbles
Bubbles are a very thin layer of liquid surrounding a pocket of gas. In the case of this unit, 
the liquid is bubble solution and the gas is air. If something punctures the surface of a 
bubble, the bubble will pop. Not all objects that come in contact with a bubble will puncture 
the surface, however. An object coated in liquid that has the same surface tension (the 
same attractive force between molecules) as a bubble can be inserted into a bubble without 
the bubble popping. 
Once fully formed, bubbles always take on a spherical shape. A sphere is the shape that 
allows for the liquid (the bubble solution) to have the smallest surface area possible. When 
bubble solution is stretched across a frame (a circular bubble wand or a more amorphous 
wire or string shape, for example) the bubble solution will also always take on the shape 
that allows for the smallest surface area possible. As you and your kids are experimenting 
with bubbles, take note of the different shapes you see, particularly when bubbles come in 
contact with each other. 
Bubble Wands
For some of the adventures in this unit, we note that either store bought wands or 
homemade wands can be used. The term store-bought wands refers to the ring-shaped 
bubble wands traditionally sold with bottles of bubble solution. Creating simple ring-shaped 
wands out of wire or pipe cleaners will also work to complete the challenges in this unit. 
Bubble Solution
Many people who have experience making bubble solutions have favorite “recipes” or 
special ingredients they like to add to standard recipes in order to increase the durability or 
longevity of bubbles. The recipe listed below is one that the Engineering Adventures team 
has had success with. If you would like to make a favorite recipe of your own, or if you 
would prefer to simply purchase bubble solution, feel free to do so.
The type of soap you use will matter. Use dish soap made to wash dishes by hand (not in a 

xvi
Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza									
© Museum of Science
dishwasher). The brand of soap is important, too. The Engineering Adventures team has 
found that Dawn® or Palmolive® work well. 
A good recipe to start with for a group of about 25 students is:
1 gallon of water
3 cups of dish soap
1 cup of glycerin
Glycerin can be purchased fairly easily and cheaply online, but in a pinch you might 
try substituting vinegar instead. As long as you store the bubble solution in a covered 
container, it should last for a long time! Letting the solution sit for about 24 hours before 
using it can also help make a stronger solution.
Bubble Troubleshooting
Whether indoors or outdoors, air currents can make it difficult to form bubbles without 
them popping. Try to be aware of the air currents in the space where you are working and 
consider shutting off air conditioning, heaters, or fans while you are working. Low humidity 
can also affect the durability and longevity of your bubbles. If you are in a very dry climate, 
a humidifier can help.
Keeping Engineering Journals Dry
The Engineering Journals provide important learning support for every Adventure, but 
finding a dry spot in the room to work on them can be tricky! If possible, leave at least one 
table in the room that is soap-free and available to use for journaling.
Bubble Safety
Bubbles can be messy! While the adventures in this unit are designed to be fun, 
encourage kids to conduct themselves carefully and responsibly as they explore. Consider 
setting up a limited number of testing stations and confining the bubble solution to specific 
areas in order to minimize mess. It is best to cover surfaces near the testing area with 
newsprint or tableclothes that can easily be removed later on. Do not cover the floor with 
plastic tarps or table cloths, however, as the plastic can become slippery and dangerous 
when coated with bubble solution. If you are conducting challenges on tile floors, consider 
taping down newsprint to minimize slipperiness. 
Dipping hands into soap or detergents may not be recommended for children with 
eczema, contact  dermatitis, or very sensitive skin. If a child complains of itching or 
redness, have them remove and rinse their hands immediately.

1.	 Come together as a group and look at the Bubble Board. Ask:
•	
What are some things you discovered about bubbles today?
2.	 Show kids the Engineering Design Process poster. Remind kids how they
used the Engineering Design Process when they made towers out of index
cards. Ask:
•	
What steps of the Engineering Design Process did we use today?
Accept all responses, but guide kids to focus on the ask step. Remind
them that they asked lots of questions about what bubbles can and cannot
do.
3.	 Give kids time to record thoughts on My Ideas About Bubbles, p. 2 in 
their Engineering Journals. Having kids record their ideas will help them 
remember what they learned and apply it in the next adventure.

Bubble Brainstorm
Adventure 1	
Message from the Duo
Hi everyone,
We are visiting our friend Miguel in California. He has an awesome 
job—he’s a materials engineer at an amusement park! Right now 
he’s helping the park design a bubble show. People who visit the 
amusement park will come to the show to see all the things bubbles 
can do. We think they should call the show Bubble Bonanza! 
Miguel is working on engineering some bubble wands for the show, 
and we said we would help out. But before we help engineer bubble 
wands, we need to know a lot more about bubbles. What do they 
look like? What can they do? Are there things they can’t do? 
We’re going to start with the ask step of the Engineering Design 
Process. Can you help us ask lots of questions about what bubbles 
can and can’t do?
India and Jacob

Preparation
Time Required: 15 minutes
1.	 Have the Message from the Duo ready to share.
2.	 Post the Engineering Design Process poster and the Challenge
of the Day.
3.	 Make a Pop Chart as shown on the next page.
4.	 Pour bubble solution into plastic containers, one for each group.
5.	 You may want to cover tables and floors with newsprint. Leave
one table uncovered so that kids can try landing bubbles on it.
6.	 Place a piece of sandpaper and a hairbrush aside to keep them
dry. You can bring these dry items out later in the lesson for
comparison purposes.
7.	 Optional: Test out some of the activities on the Bubble Challenge
Cards in the Engineering Journals yourself.
Overview: Kids will explore ways to stop bubbles from popping when landing on surfaces 
with different textures. 
Note to Educator: Often, when a bubble touches something, the thin layer of solution 
is broken and the bubble pops. But sometimes, a bubble will land on a surface and remain 
intact. If a surface is coated in soapy water, bubbles can rest on the surface without 
popping.

1.	 Tell kids that today they are going to explore ways to stop bubbles from
popping.
2.	 Have kids turn to Message from the Duo, p. 3 in their Engineering Journals, 
to see the message India has sent them about stopping bubbles from 
popping. Play track 4.
3.	 To check for understanding, ask:
•	
What is India asking us to do? Figure out how bubbles can land on
things without popping.
•	
Which steps of the Engineering Design Process did she say might
help us? Ask and imagine.
Set the Stage: How do Bubbles Pop? (5 min)
1.	 Guide students to think about bubbles they have experimented with. Ask:
•	
What happens to bubbles when they bump into other things? Some
kids may say that they can land on things, but most will say the bubbles
usually break.
2.	 Explain to kids that today they will try to make bubbles land on things with
different textures without popping. Ask:
•	
Do you think bubbles can land on rough textures, like sandpaper?
How about smooth textures, like tabletops?
3.	 Point out the Challenge of the Day and encourage kids to refer to it as they
work.
Ask: Can We Stop the Pop? (25 min)
1.	 Split kids into groups of 3-5.
2.	 Give each group a piece of sandpaper and a cup of bubble solution. Let 
them know they’ll need to share the hairbrushes. Allow kids to try some of 
the challenges on Bubble Challenges, p. 4 in their Engineering Journals.
3.	 If groups have explored for a bit and no one has successfully made a bubble
land on the surfaces, encourage kids to make the surfaces soapy before
trying to land bubbles on them.
Stop the Pop
	
Educator Page: Adventure Guide
Kids will learn: 
•	
bubbles tend to pop when they land on dry surfaces.
•	
bubbles will stay intact when they land on surfaces that are wet and soapy.
12
Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza

Tip: Have kids blow their bubbles into the air first, then land them on various 
surfaces. When kids blow bubbles directly onto the surfaces, the soap tends 
to dribble and spill, coating the surface with soap solution very quickly.

4.	 As kids explore, have them record
their results by adding check marks to
the Pop Chart. You will discuss results
together after everyone has finished
testing.
5.	 As kids work, ask:
•	
How would you describe the
texture of the things you are
working with?
•	
Do you think this texture affects
the bubbles?
Reflect (10 min)
1.	 First, review the Pop Chart. Ask:
•	
Was anyone able to make bubbles land on different things without
the bubbles popping? Did the texture matter? The texture does not
matter too much. If something is covered with bubble solution, the bubble
probably won’t pop. It is harder to cover a rough or pointy texture with
bubble solution than it is to cover a smooth texture with it.
2.	 Refer back to the Challenge of the Day. Ask:
•	
How can you make a bubble land without popping? By making the
thing it lands on soapy!
•	
How would you tell India to hold a bubble? Dip your hand in bubble
solution first.
3.	 Show kids the Engineering Design Process poster. Ask:
•	
Which steps of the Engineering Design Process did you use today?
Accept all responses, but guide kids to focus on how they used the ask
and imagine steps. Remind them that they imagined what would happen
to bubbles when they landed on rough surfaces and answered questions
about how to prevent the bubble from popping.
4.	 Give kids time to write and draw on My Ideas About Popping, p. 5 in their 
Engineering Journals. Journaling will allow kids to create a personal record of 
the days discoveries that they can refer back to during later adventures.

happens when a bubble pops? See it in slow motion:

Tip: Why can the bubbles land 
on objects with a rough texture 
when they are coated with bubble 
solution? When an object is coated 
with solution, it has the same 
surface tension as the bubble.

Message from the Duo
Hi,
Jacob and I learned a lot when we explored what bubbles can 
and can’t do. We’ve been working with Miguel to do more cool 
things with bubbles. Yesterday Jacob blew a bubble that floated 
onto the table. I thought it would pop, but it sat on the table for 
five whole minutes!
I tried to blow a bubble that would land on the table, but mine 
kept popping. I asked Jacob how he did it, but he said it was 
magic. I know that’s not true!
I think I can use the Engineering Design Process to help me ask 
more about bubbles and imagine how to blow a bubble that will 
land on the table without popping. Maybe I could even figure out 
how to blow a bubble onto some other materials, like something 
rough. Maybe sandpaper would work? Or maybe I could catch 
a bubble and hold it in my hand! That 
would really impress Jacob and Miguel. 
Let me know what you find out!

Overview: Kids will build wands of different shapes, observe the bubbles they form, and 
discuss how wand shape affects (or does not affect) bubble shape.
Note to Educator: Bubbles are made when a thin layer of soap film surrounds a pocket 
of air. The soap film pulls itself into a shape that has the smallest possible surface area, 
and this shape is always a sphere. This means that a bubble made from a wand of any 
shape will become a sphere once it is released from the wand.

1.	 Explain that Jacob has sent another message. Today he is asking them to
try making bubble wands that are different shapes. 
2.	 Have kids turn to Message from the Duo, p. 6 in their Engineering Journals.

Set the Stage (5 min)
1.	 Explain to kids that today they will get the chance to make and experiment
with bubble wands of any shape to see how the shape of the wand affects 
the shape of the bubble. Ask:
•	
Think about bubbles you have seen. What shapes were they?
Bubbles are round, circles, spheres, etc. Some kids may suggest other 
shapes, which is fine for now.
•	
Do you think the shape of the wand matters?
2.	 Point out the Challenge of the Day and encourage kids to refer back to it as
they are working.

1.	 Show kids the wire and twist ties they
will have available for making wands. 
2.	 Split kids into small groups. Give each
group a cup of bubble solution and allow 
them to explore. 
3.	 Encourage kids to create differently
shaped wands and use them to make 
bubbles. The designs on Wacky Wands, 
p. 7 in their Engineering Journals, can help kids who need more direction.
4.	 As kids are working, ask questions like:
•	
What shape is the bubble solution when it is in the wand? It takes on
the shape of the wand.
Better Shape Up
	
Educator Page: Adventure Guide
Kids will learn: 
•	
bubbles can be made with differently shaped wands.
•	
once a bubble is made, it forms a sphere—a perfectly round symmetrical shape.

Engineering Adventures: Bubble Bonanza								
© Museum of Science
Tip: Kids may ask you if 
bubble solution still attached to 
a wand “counts” as a bubble. 
Tell kids that bubble solution 
does not become a bubble until 
it is released from the wand. 
Tip: If kids finish early, challenge them to make wands that are shaped like 
animals, cartoon characters, or other shapes!

•	
What shape is the bubble after you release it from the wand? Round,
a sphere.
•	
Do you think one wand material
works better than the other? Some
kids might not like that the paper twist
ties get soggy, but others may like
that the paper lets them soak up more
solution.
5.	 Have kids use the Recording Page, p.
8 in their Engineering Journals, to keep
track of the wand shapes they used and what the bubbles looked like.
Reflect (10 min)
1.	 Have kids gather in a group, holding the wands they created. Refer back to
the Challenge of the Day. Ask:
•	
Did anyone make a wand that made bubbles that were not round?
What shape was the bubble you made? Most kids will say that all of the
bubbles were round, but a few kids will probably say they made bubbles
of other shapes.
2.	 If anyone says “yes”, have them show how they made not-round bubbles
with their wand. Kids will observe that when bubbles are blown, they are
round, without flat edges or corners. Sometimes, bubbles that are very large
can come out elongated and wobbly, but if they last long enough, they will
eventually become spheres.
3.	 Have kids think about the wand materials they tested. Ask:
•	
Did anyone find a favorite wand material? Why did you like it?
4.	 Show kids the Engineering Design Process poster. Ask:
•	
How did we use the Engineering Design Process today? Accept all
responses, but guide kids to focus on the imagine and create steps.
5.	 Give kids time to record thoughts using My Ideas About Bubble Shape, p. 9  
in their Engineering Journals. Writing about what they did today will help kids 
internalize and remember what they found out.

Extensions: Ring Around A Bubble
You will need a large open space to conduct this activity.
1.	 Have all the kids in the class hold hands.
2.	 While holding hands, have them step backwards as far apart from each other as they
can, and point out the shape they have made is a circle.
3.	 Explain that they represent the bubble solution on the outside of a bubble and the space
in the middle represents the air inside the bubble.
4.	 Have the kids demonstrate what happens when the bubble pops!
Tip: You may want to put all 
Engineering Journals on one 
dry table away from the testing 
area so kids can write down 
their findings after making 
different wands.

Message from the Duo
Hi everyone,
India and I are having a blast playing with bubbles! So far, we have 
been using the round plastic bubble wands that come inside the 
bottles of bubble solution from the store. We have made lots of 
round bubbles. But Miguel needs to engineer wands for the show 
that do interesting or surprising things with bubbles. We thought we 
would try using different materials to engineer our own wands. And 
we want to see whether we can make bubbles that are not round. 
Can you help us? 
Miguel tells us that materials engineers test and explore the 
properties of materials before they use them to engineer new 
technologies. Properties are things like color, shape, and flexibility. 
What properties of materials do you think will be good for making a 
bubble wand? We sent two materials for you to try, wire and twist 
ties. I am going to use each of them to make a square wand, and 
see if one material works better than the other. Do you think the 
bubbles it makes will be square?
Use the Engineering Design Process to 
ask questions and imagine lots of ideas! 
Explore your materials and shapes and 
let us know what you find out.

Overview: Kids test, record, and compare how well certain types of bubble tricks can be 
done with wands of different materials. 
Note to Educator: Some objects are better than others at making certain kinds of 
bubbles. For example, an object like a paper towel tube can absorb lots of bubble solution 
and make really big bubbles. Because screen has many small holes, it can create lots of 
bubbles at once, but it does not hold a lot of solution so it cannot make really big bubbles.

Message from the Duo
Hi everyone,
We learned a lot trying to engineer wands with different 
materials last week, but now we want to try even more materials. 
They’re all different shapes, sizes, and made of different things 
like paper, wire, and plastic. 
Miguel pointed out that some materials might be good to use to 
make certain kinds of bubbles, but not others. A material that’s 
good for making tiny bubbles might not be good for making giant 
bubbles. We made a list of some bubble tricks we want to try 
out. Use the Engineering Design Process to help you create 
and test different bubble wands with the materials. Let us know 
which materials are good for doing which tricks. After this, we 
think we’ll be ready to design our bubble wands for the Bubble 
Bonanza!

Message from the Duo
Hi everyone,
Wow! You’ve done some great engineering so far! We’ve asked lots 
of questions about bubbles and saw what bubbles can and can’t do. 
We’ve also asked good questions about the materials we can use to 
make our bubble wands. Now it’s time to engineer our wands! 
We want our bubble wand technologies to show people some of 
the amazing things that bubbles can do. First we need to imagine 
some different ways to combine materials. Then we can plan out our 
wand and work as an engineering team to create it. The Engineering 
Design Process will help us engineer the best wands for the Bubble 
Bonanza show!

Message from the Duo
Hi everyone,
Jacob and I are so impressed with the wands you engineered. They 
are great technologies! We know you’re using the Engineering 
Design Process to make these wands the best they can be. 
Share your ideas with each other and try to improve your wands 
even more! If your goal is to make big bubbles, can you improve 
your wand so the bubbles it makes are giant? If your goal is to make 
lots of bubbles, can you improve your wand so it makes fifty or even 
one hundred bubbles?
To help you out, we sent you one more special supply to make your 
wands even more exciting to watch during the Bubble Bonanza. 
Jacob and I can’t wait to see your final designs.
India
