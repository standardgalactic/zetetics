Foreword
This book is written based on two graduate abstract algebra courses offered at Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. It grows out
of my lecture notes that I used while I was teaching those courses many times. My intention is
to develop essential topics in algebra that can be used in research as illustrated some in the ﬁnal
chapter. Also, it can be served as a standard reference for preparing for a qualifying examination
in Algebra. I have tried to make it self-contained as much as possible. However, it may not be
suitable for reading it for the ﬁrst course in abstract algebra. It hits and goes through many basic
points quickly. A typically mathematical book style that begins with some motivation, deﬁnitions,
examples and theorems, is used throughout. I try to pause with remarks to make readers have
some thoughts before moving on.
The book also requires some background in undergraduate level linear algebra and elementary
number theory. For example, I assume the readers to have known matrix theory over a ﬁeld in
which treatment can be found in most linear algebra books. My number theory lecture note
is available on the web-page as well. However, some essential results are recalled in the ﬁrst
section. I give many examples to demonstrate new deﬁnitions and theorems. In addition, when
the converse of a theorem may not hold, counter examples are provided. The major points are
divided into ﬁve chapters as follows.
■1 Groups A group is a basic algebraic structure but it is a core in this course. I choose the
approach via group actions. Although it is not quite elementary, it is an important aspect in
dealing with groups. I also cover Sylow theorems with some applications on ﬁnite groups.
The structure theorem of ﬁnite abelian groups is also presented.
■2 Rings and Fields The abstract treatments of rings and ﬁelds using groups are presented
in the ﬁrst section. Rings discussed throughout this book always contain the identity. Ideals
and factorizations are discussed in detail. In addition, I talk about polynomials over a ring
and which will be used in a construction of ﬁeld extensions.
■3 Advanced Group Theory In this chapter, I give deeper theory of groups. Various kinds
of series of a group are studied in the ﬁrst three sections. I also have results on a linear
group. Finally, I show how to construct a group from a set of objects and presentations and
talk about a graphical representation called a Cayley graph.
■4 Modules and Noetherian Rings Modules can be considered as a generalization of vector
spaces. I cover basic concepts of modules and work on free modules. Projective and injective
modules are introduced. Moreover, I present the proof of the structure theorems for modules
over a PID. Noetherian and Artinion rings are also explored. In the end, I demonstrate some
aspects in doing research in algebra. The readers will see some applications of module
theory, especially a free R-module over commutative rings, to obtain a structure theorem
for ﬁnite dimensional symplectic spaces over a local ring. The symplectic graphs over a
commutative ring is deﬁned and studied.
■5 Field Theory I give more details on a construction of extension ﬁelds. Also, I prepare the
readers to Galois theory. Applications of Galois theory are provided in proving fundamental
theorem of algebra, ﬁnite ﬁelds, and cyclotomic ﬁelds. For the sake of completeness, I
discuss some results on a transcendental extension in the ﬁnal section.

The whole book is designed for a year course. Chapters 1 and 2 are appropriate for a ﬁrst
course and Chapters 3, 4 and 5 can be served as a more advanced course.
There are many topics that, in my opinion, they are worth mentioned. I try to break each
topic in step-by-step and scatter it as a “Project” throughout this book.
The projects consist
of lengthy/generalization exercises, computations of numerical examples, programming sugges-
tions, and research/open problems. This allows us to see that abstract algebra has many applica-
tions and is still an active subject. They are independent and can be skipped without any effects
on the continuity of the reading.
The book would not have been possible without great lectures from my abstract algebra
teachers—Ajchara Harnchoowong and Yupaporn Kemprasit at Chulalongkorn University, and Ed-
ward Formanek at the Pennsylvania State University. They initiate wonderful resources to com-
pose each section in this book. I express my gratitude to them all.
I take full responsibility for typos/mistakes that may be found in the manuscript. If you catch
ones or have any other suggestions, please write to me. I shall include and correct them in the
more up-to-date version once a year on the website. Finally, I hope that the textbook will beneﬁt
many students, teachers and researchers in Algebra and Number Theory.

Groups
We write N for the set of positive integers, Z for the set of integers, Q for the set of rational
numbers, R for the set of real numbers and C for the set of complex numbers.
In this ﬁrst chapter, we talk about a group which is a basic algebraic structure. However, it
is a core in this course. Our approach here relies on group actions. Although it is not quite
elementary, it is an important aspect in dealing with groups. We also discuss Sylow theorems
with some applications and the structure of ﬁnite abelian groups.
1.1
Integers
As a number theorist, before I jump into the abstract part, let’s lay down some foundations. My
ﬁrst undergraduate abstract algebra course started with elementary number theory—the study
of integers. It contains many examples to bear in mind while we are studying the more general
results in other abstract domains.
Theorem 1.1.1. [Division Algorithm] Given integers a and b, with b ̸= 0, there exist unique
integers q and r satisfying
a = qb + r,
where
0 ≤r < |b|.
The integers q and r are called, respectively, the quotient and remainder in the division of a by b.
Proof. To prove this theorem, we must use the well-ordering principle, namely, “every nonempty
set S of nonnegative integers contains a least element; that is, there is some integer a in S such that
a ≤b for all b ∈S”.
Existence: First we shall assume that b > 0. Let S = {a−xb : x ∈Z and a−xb ≥0} ⊆N∪{0}.
We shall show that S ̸= ∅. Since b ≥1, we have |a|b ≥|a|, so
a −(−|a|)b = a + |a|b ≥a + |a| ≥0,
Then a −(−|a|)b ∈S, so S ̸= ∅. By the well-ordering principle, S contains a least element, call
it r. Then a −qb = r for some q ∈Z. Since r ∈S, r ≥0 and a = qb + r. It remains to show that
r < b. Suppose that r ≥b. Thus,
0 ≤r −b = a −qb −b = a −(q + 1)b,
so r −b ≤r and r −b ∈S. This contradicts the minimality of r. Hence, r < b.
Next, we consider the case in which b < 0. Then |b| > 0 and Theorem 2.5.2 gives q′, r ∈Z
such that
a = q′|b| + r,
where
0 ≤r < |b|.
Since |b| = −b, we may take q = −q′ to arrive at
a = qb + r,
where
0 ≤r < |b|

as desired.
Uniqueness: Let q, q′, r, r′ ∈Z be such that
a = qb + r
and
a = q′b + r′,
where 0 ≤r, r′ < |b|. Then
(q −q′)b = r′ −r.
Since 0 ≤r, r′ < |b|, we have |r′ −r| < |b|, so |b||q −q′| = |r′ −r| < |b|. This implies that
0 ≤|q −q′| < 1, hence q = q′ which also forces r = r′.
Theorem 1.1.1 provides an important example in Section 2.4 where we discuss a more general
domain called a Euclidean domain.
An integer b is said to be divisible by an integer a ̸= 0, in symbols a | b, if there exists some
integer c such that b = ac. We write a ∤b to indicate that b is not divisible by a. Note that
a | b ⇔−a | b, so we may consider only positive divisors. The next theorem contains elementary
properties of divisibility.
Theorem 1.1.2. For integers a, b and c, the following statements hold:
1. a | 0, 1 | a, a | a.
2. a | 1 if and only if a = ±1.
3. If a | b, then a | (−b), (−a) | b and (−a) | (−b).
4. If a | b and c | d, then ac | bd.
5. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.
6. (a | b and b | a) if and only if a = ±b.
7. If a | b and b ̸= 0, then |a| ≤|b|.
8. If a | b and a | c, then a | (bx + cy) for arbitrary integers x and y.
An integer p > 1 is called a prime number, or simply a prime, if its only positive divisors are
1 and p. An integer greater than 1 which is not a prime is termed composite.
Example 1.1.1. 2, 3, 5, 11, 2011 are primes. 6, 8, 12, 2558 are composite numbers.
Let a and b be given integers, with at least one of them different from zero. The greatest
common divisor (gcd) of a and b, denoted by gcd(a, b), is the positive integer d satisfying:
1. d | a and d | b,
2. for all c ∈Z, if c | a and c | b, then c ≤d.
Basic properties of gcd are collected in the next theorem.
Theorem 1.1.3. Let a and n be integers not both zero.
1. If d = min{ax + ny > 0 : x, y ∈Z}, then d = gcd(a, n).
2. If gcd(a, n) = d, then ∃x, y ∈Z, ax + ny = d.
3. gcd(a, n) = 1 ⇔∃x, y ∈Z, ax + ny = 1.
Proof. (1) The given set contains a2 + n2, so it is not empty and d exists by the well-ordering
principle. Then d = ax + ny > 0 for some x, y ∈Z. We shall prove that d = gcd(a, n). By the
division algorithm, ∃q, r ∈Z, a = dq + r with 0 ≤r ≤d. If r > 0, then
0 < r = a −dq = a −(ax + ny)q = a(1 −xq) −nyq < d
which contradicts the minimality of d. Hence, r = 0 and d | n. Similarly, d | n. Since d = ax + ny,
gcd(a, n) | d, so gcd(a, n) ≤d. But d | a and d | n, so d ≤gcd(a, n). Hence, d = gcd(a, n). (2)
follows from (1) and (3) follows from (2). The converse of (3) is immediate.

Corollary 1.1.4. Let a, b and c be integers and p a prime.
1. If a | bc and (a, b) = 1, then a | c.
2. If p | bc and p ∤b, then p | c.
More generally, if a1, a2, . . . , ak are integers such that
p | a1a2 . . . ak, then p | ai for some i.
3. If q1, q2, . . . , qn are all primes and p | q1q2 . . . qk, then p = qi for some i.
Proof. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we have 1 = ax + by for some x, y ∈Z. Then c = acx + bcy. Since
a | bc, a | c. This proves (1). (3) follows from (2) and (2) follows from (1) and the fact that
p ∤b ⇔gcd(p, b) = 1.
In my opinion, the next theorem is the most important and everyday use result in number
theory. It also provides a core example when we study factorizations in Section 2.4. Its proof
applies the results discussed above.
Theorem 1.1.5. [Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic] Every positive integer m > 1 can be
expressed as a product of primes; this representation is unique, apart from the order in which the
factors occur.
Proof. Expressible: Assume on the contrary that there exists an integer m > 1 which is not a
product of primes. By the well-ordering principle, there is a smallest n0 such that n0 is not a
product of primes.
Then n0 is composite, so there exist integers 1 < d1, d2 < n0 such that
n0 = d1d2. Since d1, d2 < n0, d1 and d2 are products of primes, and so is n0. This gives a
contradiction. Hence, every positive integer m > 1 can be expressed as a product of primes.
Uniqueness: Assume that
m = p1p2 . . . ps = q1q2 . . . qt,
where 1 ≤s ≤t and pi and qj are prime such that
p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤ps
and
q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qt.
Corollary 1.1.4 (3) tells us that p1 = qk for some k ∈{1, . . . , t}. It makes p1 ≥q1. Similarly,
q1 = pl for some l ∈{1, . . . , s}. Then q1 ≥p1, so p1 = q1. Thus,
p2 . . . ps = q2 . . . qt.
Now, repeat the process to get p2 = q2, and we obtain
p3 . . . ps = q3 . . . qt.
Continue in this manner. If s < t, we would get
1 = qs+1qs+2 . . . qt,
which is impossible. Hence, s = t and
p1 = q1, p2 = q2, . . . , ps = qs
as desired.
Corollary 1.1.6. Any positive integer m > 1 can be written uniquely in a canonical form
m = pk1

where, for i = 1, 2, . . . , r, each ki is a positive integer and each pi is a prime, with p1 < p2 < · · · <

1. Groups
To formulate an important example in group theory, we shall discuss about the set of integers
modulo a positive integer.
Let n be a ﬁxed positive integer. Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n,
symbolized by
a ≡b
(mod n)
or
a ≡b
(mod n)
if n divides the difference a −b; that is, provided that a −b = kn for some integer k. The number
m is called the modulus of the congruence. When n ∤(a −b), then we say that a is incongruent
to b modulo n and in this case we write a ̸≡b (mod n).
Remark. If n | a, we may write a ≡0 (mod n).
The ﬁrst theorem is immediate.
Theorem 1.1.7. If a ≡b (mod n) and c ≡d (mod n), then we have:
1. ax + cy ≡bx + dy (mod n) for all integers x and y,
2. ac ≡bd (mod n),
3. am ≡bm (mod n) for every positive integer m.
For a ∈Z, it follows from the division algorithm that there exist unique q, r ∈Z such that
a = nq + r, where 0 ≤r < n. This implies a ≡r (mod n). Thus, we have shown:
Theorem 1.1.8. For each integer a, there exists a unique integer r, with 0 ≤r < n, such that
a ≡r (mod n).
In terms of congruence, Theorem 1.1.3 (3) may be restated as follows.
Corollary 1.1.9. [Inverse Modulo n] Let a and n be integers with n positive. Then gcd(a, n) = 1
if and only if there exists an integer x such that ax ≡1 (mod n). We call x the inverse of a
modulo n.
We directly obtain the following corollary from Corollary 1.1.4. It gives a condition for can-
celing integers modulo n.
Corollary 1.1.10. [Cancellative of Integers Modulo n] Let a, b, c and n be integers with n positive
and let p be a prime.
1. If ac ≡bc (mod n) and gcd(n, c) = 1, then a ≡b (mod n).
2. If ac ≡bc (mod p) and p ∤c, then a ≡b (mod p).
Finally, we shall deﬁne the set of integers modulo a positive integer n. It is not difﬁcult to see
that the congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation on Z. That is, for a, b, c ∈Z, we have:
1. [reﬂexivity] a ≡a (mod n),
2. [symmetry] a ≡b (mod n) implies b ≡a (mod n),
3. [transitivity] a ≡b (mod n) and b ≡c (mod n) imply b ≡c (mod n).
For a ∈Z, the equivalence class of a is given by
¯a = {b ∈Z : b ≡a
(mod n)} = {kn + a : k ∈Z}
It also follows from Theorem 1.1.8 that the set of all equivalence classes is
{0, 1, . . . , n −1}.
This set is called the set of integers modulo n. In the next section, this set will be an important
example of “groups” and will be denoted by Zn.

As we have discussed, integers have many interesting properties in a way that we can picture
them. Next, we shall travel to the abstract parts of the course. In the ﬁrst two chapters, especially
in Chapter 2, we shall see many similarities and generalizations of the integers under operations
+ and ·. The readers should keep this section in mind to avoid getting lost in this subject.
Exercises 1.1.
1. Let d = gcd(a, b). Prove that:
(a) gcd(a/d, b/d) = 1
(b) gcd(a −bq, b) = d for all q ∈Z.
2. [Euclidean Algorithm] Let a and b be positive integers, with b ≤a. Repeatedly applications of the

1.2
Groups
In order to study abstract senses of algebra, we shall begin with the deﬁnition of a group which
occupies a very important seat in this course.
1.2.1
Deﬁnitions and Examples
For a nonempty set S, a function · : S × S →S is called a binary operation and image of (a, b) in
S × S is denoted by a · b and it is said to be the product of a and b. A groupoid is a system (S, ·)
consisting of a nonempty set S with binary operation · on S. We may write S for (S, ·) and ab for
a · b where a, b ∈S if there is no ambiguity.
Let S be a groupoid. For nonempty subsets A and B of S and x ∈S, let
AB = {ab : a ∈A and b ∈B},
xA = {x}A
and
Ax = A{x}.
If S satisﬁes the associative law, i.e., ∀a, b, c ∈S, (a·b)·c = a·(b·c), we say that S is a semigroup.
Notice that if S is a semigroup, then any bracketing of x1, . . . , xn gives the same product, so we
can write x1 · · · xn for this product. In addition, for a ∈S and m ∈N, we may let am = a · · · a (m
copies). A groupoid S is said to be commutative if ∀a, b ∈S, ab = ba.

6
1. Groups
An element e of a groupoid S is a two-sided identity or identity if ∀a ∈S, ae = a = ea.
Clearly, S contains at most one identity (if e and e′ are identity, then e = ee′ = e). A monoid is a
semigroup with (unique) identity. Let S be a monoid with identity e. If a and b in S are such that
ab = e = ba, then b is called a two-sided inverse or inverse of a. We have that every element of
S has at most one inverse. For, if b and b′ are inverses of a, then ab = e = ba and ab′ = e = b′a, so
b = be = b(ab′) = (ba)b′ = eb′ = b′.
A group is a monoid G such that every element of G has an inverse, and for a ∈G, let a−1
denote the (unique) inverse of a. A commutative group is also called an abelian group. The
order of a group G is the cardinal number |G|.
Remark. For a nonempty set G with binary operation on G is a group if the following axioms are
all satisﬁed:
(G1) [associativity] ∀a, b, c ∈G, (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
(G2) [identity] ∃e ∈G, ∀a ∈G, ae = a = ea
(G3) [inverse] ∀a ∈G, ∃b ∈G, ab = e = ba.
Let G be a group with identity e. For a ∈G and m ∈N, let a0 = e and a−m = (a−1)m.
Remarks.
1. For a group G, we have:
(a) e−1 = e and ∀a ∈G, (a−1)−1 = a,
(b) ∀a ∈G, ∀m, n ∈Z, aman = am+n and (am)n = amn, and
(c) ∀a, b ∈G, (ab)−1 = b−1a−1 because (ab)(b−1a−1) = e.
2. In case G is abelian, we may choose to write G additively. This means:
(a) The binary operation is denoted by +.
(b) 0 denotes the identity element and −a denotes the inverse of a.
(c) ∀a ∈G, ∀m ∈N, ma = a + · · · + a (m copies).
3. A group G satisﬁes the cancellation law: ∀a, b, c ∈G, ab = ac (or ba = ca) ⇒b = c.
Examples 1.2.1 (Examples of groups).
1. (Z, −) is a groupoid which is not a semigroup;
(N, +) is a semigroup which is not a monoid; (N, ·) is a monoid which is not a group.
2. (Z, +), (Q, +), (R, +), (C, +), (Q∗, ·), (R∗, ·) and (C∗, ·) are inﬁnite abelian groups. Here, A∗
denotes the set of nonzero elements of A.
3. Let X be a set and P(X) the power set of X. For subsets A and B of X, we deﬁne A△B =
(A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A). Then (P(X), △) is an abelian group having the empty set as its identity
and A−1 = A for all A ∈P(X). Also, (P(X), ∩) is a commutative monoid with identity X.
4. For n ∈N, let Zn = {0, 1, . . . , n −1} called the set of integers modulo n, where a =
{kn + a : k ∈Z} for all a ∈Z. Deﬁne + and · on Zn by
a + b = a + b
and
a · b = a · b
for all a, b ∈Z.
These binary operations are well deﬁned by Theorem 1.1.7. It follows that (Zn, +) is an
abelian group of order n. Moreover, (Zn, ·) is a commutative monoid with identity 1.
5. For n ∈N and n ≥2, let Z×
n = {a : gcd(a, n) = 1}. By Theorem 1.1.3 (3), we have (Z×
n , ·) is
an abelian group. We write φ(n) for the order of Z×
n . It is the Euler φ-function. Note that
Z×
n = Zn ∖{0} ⇔n is a prime.
Proof. If n is a prime, then Z×
n = {1, 2, . . . , n −1} = Zn ∖{0}. Conversely, assume that n is compos-
ite. Then n = bc for some 1 < b, c < n, so gcd(b, n) and gcd(c, n) are > 1. Thus, b, c /∈Z×
n . Since
b, c < n, we have b, c ̸= 0. Hence, Z×
n ⫋Zn ∖{0}.
Remark. We recall some properties of the Euler’s φ-function as follows.
(a) If p is a prime, then φ(p) = p −1 and φ(pk) = pk −pk−1 for all k ∈N.
(b) φ is multiplicative, namely, if gcd(m, n) = 1, then φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n).
6. Write F for any of Q, R, C or other ﬁelds. Let Mn(F) be the set of n × n matrices over F
and GLn(F) the set of matrices over F with nonzero determinants. Then (Mn(F), +) is an
abelian group and GLn(F) is a group under multiplication which is not abelian if n > 1.
The later group is called the general linear group.

1.2. Groups
7
7. For a nonempty set X, a function on X which is 1-1 and onto (a bijection on X) is said to be
a permutation of X. Let S(X) be the set of all permutations of X. Then under composition,
(S(X), ◦) is a group called the symmetric group on X; in case X = {1, 2, . . . , n}, we write
Sn and call Sn the symmetric group on n letters. It is a group of order n!.
Some equivalent deﬁnitions of groups are collected in the next theorem.
Theorem 1.2.1. [Criteria for Being a Group] Let G be a semigroup. Then the following statements
are equivalent.
(i) G is a group.
(ii) (a) ∃e ∈G ∀a ∈G, ea = a and (b) ∀a ∈G ∃b ∈G, ba = e.
(iii) (a) ∃e ∈G ∀a ∈G, ae = a and (b) ∀a ∈G ∃b ∈G, ab = e.
(iv) ∀a, b ∈G ∃x, y ∈G, ax = b and ya = b.
(v) ∀a ∈G, aG = G = Ga.
Proof. If (i) holds, (ii)–(v) are clearly true. (iv) ⇔(v) is obvious.
(ii) ⇒(i). Assume (ii). Let a ∈G. Then ∃b ∈G, ba = e, and so ∃c ∈G, cb = e. Thus,
ab = e(ab) = (cb)(ab) = c(ba)b = c(eb) = cb = e.
Moreover, ae = a(ba) = (ab)a = ea = a.
“(iii) ⇒(i)” is similar to “(ii) ⇒(i)”.
(iv) ⇒(iii). Assume (iv). Let a ∈G. Then ∃e ∈G, ae = a. Let b ∈G. Then ∃c ∈G, bc = e and
∃y ∈G, ya = b. Thus, be = (ya)e = y(ae) = ya = b.
Theorem 1.2.2. If G is a ﬁnite cancellative semigroup, then G is a group.
Proof. We shall show that ∀a ∈G, aG = G = Ga. Let a ∈G. Since G is cancellative, |aG| = |G| =
|Ga|. Clearly, aG ⊆G and Ga ⊆G. Since G is ﬁnite, aG = G = Ga.
Remark. (N, +) is an inﬁnite cancellative semigroup, but it is not a group.
1.2.2
Subgroups
Sometimes a group contains a nonempty subset that is closed under its operation. In this subsec-
tion, we discuss a small group in a bigger one with the same operation.
A nonempty subset H of a group G is said to be a subgroup of G if H is a group under the
same operation of G and we write H ⩽G. Observe that for ∅̸= H ⊆G,
H ⩽G
⇔
∀a, b ∈H, ab ∈H ∧a−1 ∈H
⇔
∀a, b ∈H, ab−1 ∈H.
Moreover, {e} and G are always subgroups of G. Theorem 1.2.2 gives the following important
fact.
Corollary 1.2.3. If H is a ﬁnite nonempty subset of a group G which is closed under the operation
of G, then H is a subgroup of G.
Proof. Since G is a cancellative semigroup and ∅̸= H ⊆G, H is a ﬁnite cancellative semigroup.
Hence, H is a group by Theorem 1.2.2.
Next, we investigate the group of symmetries. We begin with the following groups.

8
1. Groups
Examples 1.2.2 (Group of symmetries).
1. The set of rotations about a point 0 in the plane;
composition as usual. If 0 is taken to be the origin, the rotation through an angle θ can be
represented analytically as the map
(x, y) 7→(x cos θ −y sin θ, x sin θ + y cos θ) =
 x
y
  cos θ
sin θ
−sin θ
cos θ

.
For θ = 0, we get the identity map and the inverse of the rotation through the angle θ is the
rotation through −θ. It is called the rotation group.
2. The set of rotations together with the set of reﬂections in the lines which passes through 0 with
slope tan α. The latter are given analytically by
(x, y) 7→(x cos 2α + y sin 2α, x sin 2α −y cos 2α) =
 x
y
 cos 2α
sin 2α
sin 2α
−cos 2α

.
The product of two reﬂections is a rotation and the product in either order of a reﬂection
and a rotation is a reﬂection.
3. Consider the regular n-gon (that is, the n-sided polygon in which the sides are all the same
length and are symmetrically placed about a common center) inscribed in the unit circle
in the plane, so that one of the vertices is (1, 0). The vertices subtend angles of 0, 2π/n,
4π/n, . . . , 2(n −1)π/n radians with the positive x-axis. The subset of rotation maps which
maps our ﬁgure into itself consists of the n rotations through angles of 0, 2π/n, 4π/n, . . . , 2(n−
1)π/n radians, respectively. These elements form a subgroup Rn of the rotation group de-
ﬁned in (1).
4. We now consider the set Dn of rotations and reﬂections which map the regular n-gon, as in
(3), into itself. These form a subgroup of the group deﬁned in (2). We shall call the elements
of this group the symmetries of the regular n-gon. The reﬂection in the x-axis is one of our
symmetries. Multiplying this on the right by the n rotational symmetries we obtain n distinct
reﬂectional symmetries. These give them all, for if we let σ denote the reﬂection in the x-
axis and τ denote any reﬂectional symmetry then στ is one of the n-rotational symmetries
ρ1, . . . , ρn, say ρi. Since σ2 = 1, στ = ρj gives τ = σρj which is one of those we counted.
Thus, Dn consists of n rotations and n reﬂections and its order is 2n. The group Dn is called
the dihedral group. Note that Dn = {σiρj : i ∈{0, 1} and j ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1}}.
Remark. It is easy to see that the intersection of a family of subgroups of a group G is a subgroup
of G. If H and K are subgroups of a group G, then, in general, H ∪K is not a subgroup of G.
However, if H and K are subgroups of a group G with G = H ∪K, then H = G or K = G.
Proof. Assume that there is an x ∈G ∖H and a y ∈G ∖K. Since G = H ∪K, we have x ∈K and y ∈H.
Thus, xy /∈H and xy /∈K, a contradiction.
Let G be a group and A a subset of G. Deﬁne ⟨A⟩to be the intersection of all subgroups of G
containing A. It is the smallest subgroup of G containing A and is called the subgroup of G
generated by A. The elements of A are called generators. Moreover, we have ⟨∅⟩= {e} and
⟨A⟩= {an1
1 . . . ank
k
: ai ∈A and ni ∈Z}
if A ̸= ∅.
For a1, . . . , am ∈G, we write ⟨a1, . . . , am⟩for ⟨{a1, . . . , am}⟩. Then ∀a ∈G, ⟨a⟩= {an : n ∈Z} =
⟨a−1⟩is called the cyclic subgroup of G generated by a and the order of a is |⟨a⟩| (ﬁnite or
inﬁnite) and denoted by |a| or o(a). If G = ⟨a⟩for some a ∈G, then G is said to be the cyclic
group generated by a.
A subgroup N of G is normal, denoted by N ⊴G, if ∀g ∈G ∀x ∈N, gxg−1 ∈N.
Examples 1.2.3 (Examples of subgroups and normal subgroups).
1. {e} and G are normal
subgroups of G. They are called the trivial normal subgroups.

1.2. Groups
9
2. Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal.
3. Let SLn(F) be the set of matrices over F with determinant one. Then SLn(F) is a normal
subgroup of GLn(F) because det(PQP −1) = det Q for all P, Q ∈GLn(F).
4. Rn = ⟨ρ2π/n⟩and Rn ⊴Dn because σρjσ = ρ−1
j
for all j.
Remarks.
1. N ⊴G if and only if (N ≤G and ∀g ∈G, gNg−1 = N).
2. If N is a subgroup of a group G, then (∀g ∈G, gNg−1 = N) ⇔(∀g ∈G, gN = Ng).
Let G be a group and X a nonempty subset of G. The centralizer of X is the set
CG(X) = {g ∈G : ∀x ∈X, gx = xg}
and the normalizer of X is the set
NG(X) = {g ∈G : gX = Xg}.
We call Z(G) = CG(G) = {z ∈G : ∀x ∈G, zx = xz}, the center of G.
Remarks.
1. The centralizer and normalizer of X are subgroups of G.
Proof. Since ∀x ∈G, ex = xe, we have e ∈CG(X). Let g, h ∈CG(X). Let x ∈X. Then gx = xg and
hx = xh, so xh−1 = h−1x and
(gh−1)x = g(h−1x) = g(xh−1) = (gx)h−1 = (xg)h−1 = x(gh−1).
Thus, gh−1 ∈CG(X). We leave NG(X) as an exercise.
2. Z(G) ⊴G and Z(G) = T
x∈G CG({x}).
Proof. By (1), Z(G) is a subgroup of G. To see it is normal, let g ∈G and z ∈Z(G). Let x ∈G. Then
zg = gz and zx = xz, so
(gzg−1)x = (zgg−1)x = zx = xz = x(zgg−1) = x(gzg−1).
Hence, gzg−1 ∈Z(G). Finally, for z ∈G,
z ∈Z(G) ⇔∀x ∈G, xz = zx ⇔∀x ∈G, z ∈CG({x}) ⇔z ∈
\
x∈G
CG({x}).
This proves the second statement.
3. G is abelian ⇔Z(G) = G. (This is clear.)
4. If K ≤G, then K ⊴NG(K) and NG(K) is the largest subgroup of G containing K in which
K is normal (this means ∀H ≤G, K ⊴H ⇒H ⊆NG(K)).
Proof. If g ∈K, then gK = K = Kg, so K ≤NG(K). To see K is normal in NG(K), let x ∈NG(K)
and g ∈K. Since Kx = xK, we have xg ∈Kx, so xg = kx for some k ∈K. Thus xgx−1 = k ∈K.
Next, let H be a subgroup of G such that K is normal in H. Then ∀h ∈H, Kh = hK which implies
H ⊆NG(K).
1.2.3
Homomorphisms
We now study a function between two groups that is required to preserve group operations.
Let G and H be two groups. A homomorphism from G to H is a map ϕ : G →H which
satisﬁes
ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y)
for all x, y ∈G.
An injective homomorphism is called a monomorphism and a surjective homomorphism is called
an epimorphism. An isomorphism is a homomorphism which is both injective and surjective. We
write G ∼= H if ∃ϕ : G →H, ϕ is an isomorphism. An endomorphism of G is a homomorphism
on G and an automorphism of G is an isomorphism of G onto itself.

10
1. Groups
Examples 1.2.4 (Examples of group homomorphisms).
1. ϕ1 : Z →Zn given by ϕ(a) = ¯a is
a homomorphism.
2. ϕ2 : (R, +) →(R×, ·) given by ϕ(x) = 2x is a homomorphism.
3. ϕ3 : GLn(R) →R given by ϕ(A) = det A is a homomorphism.
The kernel of a homomorphism ϕ : G →H is given by the set
ker ϕ = {g ∈G : ϕ(g) = eH}.
Example 1.2.5. ker ϕ1 = nZ, ker ϕ2 = {0} and ker ϕ3 = SLn(R).
Remarks. Let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism of groups.
1. ϕ(eG) = eH and ϕ(a−1) = (ϕ(a))−1 for all a ∈G.
Proof. Note that eHϕ(eG) = ϕ(eG) = ϕ(eGeG) = ϕ(eG)ϕ(eG). By cancellation in H, we have eH =
ϕ(eG). Next, let a ∈G. Then ϕ(a)ϕ(a−1) = ϕ(aa−1) = ϕ(eG) = eH. Hence, ϕ(a−1) = ϕ(a)−1.
2. ϕ is 1-1 ⇔ker ϕ = {eG}.
Proof. Assume that ϕ is 1-1. By (1), eG ∈ker ϕ. Let x ∈ker ϕ. Then ϕ(x) = eH = ϕ(eG). Since ϕ is
1-1, we have x = eG. Conversely, suppose that ker ϕ = {eG}. Let x, y ∈G be such that ϕ(x) = ϕ(y).
Then eH = ϕ(x)−1ϕ(y) = ϕ(x−1)ϕ(y) = ϕ(x−1y). Thus, x−1y ∈ker ϕ, so x−1y = eG. Hence,
x = y.
Theorem 1.2.4. Let ϕ be a homomorphism of a group G into a group H.
1. ker ϕ is a normal subgroup of G.
2. im ϕ = {ϕ(g) : g ∈G} = ϕ(G) is a subgroup of H.
Proof. Since ϕ(eG) = eH, eG ∈ker ϕ and eH ∈im ϕ. Let x, y ∈ker ϕ. Then ϕ(x) = eH = ϕ(y), so
ϕ(xy−1) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y−1) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y)−1 = eHe−1
H = eH.
Thus, xy−1 ∈ker ϕ. Hence, ker ϕ is a subgroup of G. Next, let g ∈G and x ∈ker ϕ. Then
ϕ(x) = eH and
ϕ(gxg−1) = ϕ(g)ϕ(x)ϕ(g−1) = ϕ(g)ϕ(x)ϕ(g)−1 = ϕ(g)eHϕ(g)−1 = eH.
Thus, gxg−1 ∈ker ϕ, and so ker ϕ is normal. Finally, let y, z ∈im ϕ. Then ∃x1, x2 ∈G, ϕ(x1) = y
and ϕ(x2) = z. Thus,
yz−1 = ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)−1 = ϕ(x1)ϕ(x−1
2 ) = ϕ(x1x−1
2 ).
Since x1x−1
2
∈G, yz−1 ∈im ϕ. Hence, im ϕ is a subgroup of H.
Remark. If ϕ : G →H is a homomorphism and H1 ≤H, then ker ϕ ⊆ϕ−1(H1) ≤G.
The next result is clear. It gives another way to construct a group for the Cartesian product of
groups.
Theorem 1.2.5. [Cartesian Product of Groups] If G1 and G2 are groups, then the Cartesian

Project 1 (Quaternions). Consider the eight objects ±1, ±i, ±j and ±k with multiplication rules:
ij = k
jk = i
ki = j
ji = −k
kj = −i
ik = −j
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1
where the minus signs behave as expected and 1 and −1 multiply as expected. (For example, (−1)j = −j
and (−i)(−j) = ij = k.) Show that these objects form a group containing only one element of order 2.
This group is called the quaternion group and is denoted by Q8. [Hint. The difﬁculty is to show that the
operation is associative. One may transform the elements and operation into 2 × 2 matrices and matrix
products, respectively.]
Project 2 (Associativity). One of the required properties for (G, ∗) to be a group is associativity. However,
this is the hardest one to check as one can see from the previous item. Consider the set {a, b, c} of three
distinct elements and the operation ∗given by
∗
a
b
c
a
a
b
c
b

To check associativity, we must check every possible instance of the equation (x ∗y) ∗z = x ∗(y ∗z). That
means we must think of every possible combination of what x, y, and z could be. After a while, we ﬁnd that
(b ∗c) ∗c = a but b ∗(c ∗c) = b. Hence, the set {a, b, c} under the operation ∗is not associative. Be careful!
Many students make the mistake of concluding that a set is associative by checking just a few examples. We
cannot do this! To determine whether or not a set is associative, you must check every single combination
of 3 elements, unless you have a good general argument for why all combinations will be associative or
you have a good reason (such as the existence of an identity element) for limiting the number of cases you
must check. (Notice that even when you have the existence of an identity element, you still have to check
ALL the cases which do not include the identity element.)

Now, for the set of two elements {a, b} the number of different binary operations on this set is 16.
However, the number of associative binary operation on that set is only 8. This can be checked by writing
all out and counting. Unfortunately, for the set of three elements {a, b, c}, there are 3(3·3) = 19683 binary
operations. How to know how many associative binary operations there are on a set of three elements?

Group Actions
Let G be a group. For each g ∈G, deﬁne the left multiplication function ℓg : G →G by
ℓg(x) = gx
for all x ∈G.
By the left cancellation on G, ℓg is a bijection and so ℓg ∈S(G), the symmetric group on G. It
is easy to see that the map g 7→ℓg is an injective group homomorphism from G into S(G). This
proves an important result in group theory.
Theorem 1.3.1. [Cayley] Every group G is isomorphic to a subgroups of S(X) for some set X.
Allowing an abstract group to behave like a group of permutations, as happened in the proof
of Cayley’s theorem, is a useful tool. In this section, we talk about how a group acting on a set,
called a group action. There are many nice results and applications as we shall see in the following
sections and chapters.
Let G be a group with identity element e and X a nonempty set. We say that G acts on X or
X is a G-set if there is a mapping G × X →X (denoted by g · x or gx) which satisﬁes:
1. ∀x ∈X, e · x = x
and
2. ∀g, h ∈G, ∀x ∈X, g · (h · x) = (gh) · x.
Assume that a group G act on a set X. Then each g ∈G determines a set map φg : X →X by
φg(x) = gx.
Moreover, ∀g ∈G, φg is a bijection (1-1 and onto). Hence, φg ∈S(X), the symmetric group on X.
The map g
θ7→φg deﬁnes a group homomorphism from G to S(X) (i.e., φgh = φg ◦φh for all
g, h ∈G). Its kernel is the set
{g ∈G : gx = x for all x ∈X}.
1. If g = e is the only element of G such that gx = x for all x ∈X, then G is said to act
faithfully on X. In this case, G ֒→S(X).
2. If x ∈X, the set Gx = {gx : g ∈G} is called the orbit of x.
3. If Gx = X for some (and hence all) x ∈X, then G is said to act transitively on X.
4. If Y ⊆X, the set {g ∈G : gY = Y } is called the stabilizer of Y , denoted by StabG Y . The
stabilizer of Y is a subgroup of G.
Proof. Clearly, e ∈StabG Y . Let g, h ∈StabG Y . Then gY = Y and hY = Y . Thus, (gh)Y =
g(hY ) = gY = Y and g−1Y = g−1(gY ) = eY = Y .
Examples 1.3.1 (Examples of group actions).
1. If X is a set, S(X) acts naturally on X by
f · x = f(x) for all f ∈S(X) and x ∈X. This action is faithfully if |X| > 1. In particular,
Sn acts on {1, 2, . . . , n}. The orbit of each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is all of {1, 2, . . . , n}, thus Sn
acts transitively on {1, 2, . . . , n}. If Y ⊆{1, 2, . . . , n}, the stabilizer of Y is isomorphic to
S(Y ) × S(Z) ∼= Sk × Sn−k where Z = {1, 2, . . . , n} ∖Y . Hence, the stabilizer of {n} is
isomorphic to Sn−1.

1.3. Group Actions
13
2. Let G be any group and let X = G, considered as a set. Let G act on X by left multiplication
g · x = gx.
This action is called the left regular representation. It is faithful and transitive.
3. GLn(F) acts faithfully on F n, the set of n × 1 column vectors by left multiplication. The
orbit of ⃗0 is itself and GLn(F) acts transitively on the nonzero vectors.
4. Let G be any group and let X be any set. Let G act on X by g·x = x for all g ∈G and x ∈X.
This is called the trivial G action. Assuming g ̸= e and X has more than one element, this
action is not faithful and not transitive. All orbits are singleton and G is the stabilizer of
every subset of X.
5. Let G be a group and let X = G, considered as a set. Let G act on X by conjugation
g · x = gxg−1.
This action may not be faithful. The center of G acts trivially. The orbit of x ∈G is the set
of conjugates of x, that is
g · X = {gxg−1 : g ∈G},
called the conjugacy class of x. If |G| > 1, then this action is not transitive. The number
of orbits of the number of conjugacy classes. If Y is a subset of G, the stabilizer of Y under
the action is its normalizer, i.e., StabG Y = NG(Y ).
6. Let G be a group and let H be a subgroup of G. Let H act on G by left multiplication. This
action is faithful and the orbit of x ∈G is
H · x = {hx : h ∈H} = Hx.
The action is not transitive unless H = G. Moreover, we can let H act on G by h · g = gh−1
for all h ∈H and g ∈G. This action is also faithful and the orbit of x ∈G is
H · x = {xh−1 : h ∈H} = {xh : h ∈H} = xH.
7. Let X = C ∪{∞}, a set that becomes the Riemann sphere in complex analysis. The group
GL2(C) acts on X by the linear fractional transformation
a
b
c
d

· z = az + b
cz + d,
the understanding being the image of ∞is a/c and the image of −d/c is ∞, just as if we
were to pass to a limit in each case.
8. Let SL2(R) be the subgroup of real matrices in GL2(R) of determinant one, and let H be the
subset of C ∪{∞} in which Im z > 0, called the Poincaré upper half plane. Then SL2(R)
acts on H by linear fractional transformations.
Now, we present another way to view the orbits.
Theorem 1.3.2. Let G be a group and suppose G acts on a nonempty set X. Deﬁne a relation ∼
on X by
x ∼y
⇔
∃g ∈G, y = g · x.
Then
1. ∼is an equivalence relation on X.
2. The equivalence class of x ∈X under ∼is Gx = {gx : g ∈G}, the orbit of x. Thus, X is a
disjoint union of orbits under the action of G.

14
1. Groups
Proof. It is routine to show that ∼is an equivalence relation on X. The equivalence class of x is
[x]∼= {y ∈X : x ∼y} = {y ∈X : ∃g ∈G, y = gx} = {gx : x ∈X} = Gx
and hence X = S
x∈X Gx.
If H is a subgroup of G and x ∈G, the set
Hx = {hx : h ∈H}
and
xH = {xh : h ∈H}
are called a left coset of H in G and a right coset of H in G, respectively.
From Example 1.3.1 (6), we can let H act on G in two ways. Then Hx [xH] is an orbit of x,
and so G is a disjoint union of left [right] cosets of H in G. If we choose a subset {xα} of G
such that G is the disjoint union of the left cosets Hxα, then {xα} is called a right transversal or
system of left coset representatives of H in G and if we choose a subset {xα} of G such that G
is the disjoint union of the right cosets yαH, then {yα} is called a left transversal or system of
right coset representatives of H in G.
Remarks.
1. By Theorem 1.3.2,
(a) G = S
x∈G Hx [G = S
x∈G xH],
(b) ∀x, y ∈G, Hx = Hy or Hx ∩Hy = ∅[∀x, y ∈G, xH = yH or xH ∩yH = ∅],
(c) ∀x, y ∈G, Hx = Hy ⇔xy−1 ∈H [∀x, y ∈G, xH = yH ⇔y−1x ∈H].
2. ∀a ∈G, |H| = |Ha| = |aH| by cancellation on H.
3. The map aH 7→Ha−1 for all a ∈G is a 1-1 correspondence between the sets {xH : x ∈G}
and {Hx : x ∈G}.
Proof. For a, b ∈G, aH = bH ⇔b−1a ∈H ⇔a−1b ∈H ⇔Ha−1 = Hb−1. Then this map is 1-1,
well deﬁned and clearly onto.
The index of H in G, denoted by [G : H], is the cardinal number of distinct right (or left)
cosets of H in G, that is,
[G : H] = |{Hx : x ∈G}| = |{xH : x ∈G}|.
Next, we show that a subgroup of index two is always a normal subgroup.
Theorem 1.3.3. If H is a subgroup of G of index two, then H is normal in G.
Proof. Since [G : H] = 2, G has exactly two right (or left) cosets. Then Hg = G ∖H and
gH = G ∖H for all g ∈G not in H. Hence, ∀g ∈G, Hg = gH, so H is normal in G.
Let I and A be sets. Deﬁne Ai = {(i, a) : a ∈A} for all i ∈I. Then |Ai| = |A| for all i ∈I,
Ai ∩Aj = ∅if i ̸= j, and

Lagrange observed an important property of subgroups of G, namely, its order must be a divisor
of the order of G.
Theorem 1.3.4. [Lagrange] If H is a subgroup of G, then |G| = [G : H]|H|. In particular, if G is
ﬁnite and H < G, then |H| divides |G|, and so |a| = |⟨a⟩| divides |G| for all a ∈G.

|G| =

|H| = |Λ||H| = [G : H]|H|.
If G is ﬁnite, then |H| divides |G|. In addition, ∀a ∈G, ⟨a⟩≤G, so |a| = |⟨a⟩| divides |G| for all
a ∈G.
Corollary 1.3.5. If G is a group of prime order, then {e} and G are the only two subgroups of G
and G must be cyclic.
Proof. Let H ≤G. Then |H| divides |G| = p, so |H| = 1 or |H| = p. Thus, H = {e} and H = G.
Also, if a ̸= e, then ⟨a⟩̸= {e}. Hence, ⟨a⟩= G and so G is cyclic.
A relationship between the stabilizer of x in a group G and the number of elements in the
orbit G · x is recorded in the next theorem.
Theorem 1.3.6. [Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem] Let a group G act on a set X and suppose x ∈X.
Then [G : StabG x] = |G · x|, that is, the index of the stabilizer of x in G is the number of elements
in the orbit of x.
Proof. Let x ∈X. Note that for all g1, g2 ∈G,
g1x = g2x ⇔(g−1
2 g1)x = x ⇔g−1
2 g1 ∈StabG{x} ⇔g1 StabG{x} = g2 StabG{x}.
Then |{gx : g ∈G}| = |{g StabG x : g ∈G}|. Hence, |G · x| = [G : StabG x].
This theorem is most useful when this index is ﬁnite but it is true in general. We see some
applications of this theorem in the following results.
Theorem 1.3.7. Let G be a group and x ∈G. Then the following statements hold.
1. |{gxg−1 : g ∈G}| = [G : CG(x)], i.e., the number of conjugates of x is [G : CG(x)].
2. If G is ﬁnite, then the number of conjugates of x is a divisor of |G|.
Proof. It follows directly from the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem if we consider the action of G on G
by conjugation.
Observe that for each x ∈G,
|{gxg−1 : g ∈G}| = 1 ⇔{gxg−1 : g ∈G} = {x} ⇔∀g ∈G, gx = xg ⇔x ∈Z(G).
Corollary 1.3.8. [Class Equation] Let G be a ﬁnite group and let x1, . . . , xs represent the conju-
gacy classes of G which contains more than one element. Then
|G| = |Z(G)| +
s
X
i=1
[G : CG(xi)].
Now, let G act on the set of all subsets of G by conjugation, i.e., if Y ⊂G, then g · Y = gY g−1.
Under this action the stabilizer of Y is {g ∈G : gY g−1 = Y } = NG(Y ), the normalizer of Y , and
the orbit of Y is {gY g−1 : g ∈G}, the set of conjugates of Y . Thus, the number of conjugates
of Y is the index of the normalizer of Y . Hence, we have shown:

16
1. Groups
Theorem 1.3.9. Let G be a ﬁnite group and Y a subset of G. Then the number of conjugates of Y
is [G : NG(Y )] where NG(Y ) is the normalizer of Y . In particular, the number of conjugates of Y
divides the group order.
Remark. If H is a subgroup of G, then H ⊳NG(H) < G. Hence, if G is ﬁnite, then the number of
conjugates of H is
[G : NG(H)] =
[G : H]
[NG(H) : H] ≤[G : H].
Burnside’s theorem gives the number of orbits in X under the action of a ﬁnite group G.
Theorem 1.3.10. [Burnside] Let a ﬁnite group G act on a ﬁnite set X. For each g ∈G, let
Xg = {x ∈X : gx = x}, the set of points in X ﬁxed by g. Then the number of orbits in X is
N =
1
|G|
X
g∈G
|Xg|.
Proof. Let U be the subset of G × X deﬁned by
U = {(g, x) ∈G × X : gx = x}.
For h ∈G, let
U(h) = U ∩({h} × X) = {(h, x) : x ∈X and hx = x}.
For y ∈X, let
U[y] = U ∩(G × {y}) = {(g, y) : g ∈G and gy = y} = (StabG{y}) × {y}.
Now, U = S
g∈G U(g) = S
x∈X U[x] and these unions are “disjoint”. Note that for each g ∈G,
|U(g)| = |Xg| and for each x ∈X, |U[x]| = | StabG{x}| = [G : G · x] = |G|/|G · x|. Thus,

|G · x| = |G|N
as desired.
Corollary 1.3.11. Let a ﬁnite group G act transitively on a ﬁnite set X. Then |G| = P
g∈G |Xg|.
Moreover, if |X| > 1, then there exists a g ∈G ﬁxing no point of X.
Proof. Since G acts transitively on X, N = 1, and so |G| = P
g∈G |Xg|. Assume that |X| > 1 and
no g ∈G ﬁxing no point of X. Then ∀g ∈G, ∃x ∈X, gx = x which implies that |Xg| ≥1 for all
g ∈G. Thus,
|G| ≤
X
g∈G
|Xg| = |G|.
This forces that |Xg| = 1 for all g ∈G. But |Xe| = |X| > 1, a contradiction. Hence, there exists a
g ∈G ﬁxing no point of X.
We have known from Lagrange’s theorem that the order of any subgroups of a group G is a
divisor of |G|. The next theorem implies that if |G| has a prime divisor p, then G has a subgroup
of order p. Its proof is another application of group actions.
Theorem 1.3.12. [Cauchy] Suppose G is a ﬁnite group and a prime p divides |G|. Then the
number of solutions of gp = e in G is a multiple of p. Hence, G contains an element of order p. In
particular, if G is a ﬁnite group and a prime p divides |G|, then G has a subgroup of order p.

1.3. Group Actions
17
Proof. Consider the set Y = G × G × · · · × G (p copies) and let X = {(g1, g2, . . . , gp) ∈Y :
g1g2 · · · gp = e}. Then |X| = |G|p−1 since gp = (g1g2 . . . gp−1)−1. Let Rp = ⟨ρ2π/p⟩act on X by
ρ2π/p(g1, g2, . . . , gp) = (g2, g3, . . . , gp, g1).
Note that the orbit of (g1, g2, . . . , gp) ∈X under this action has either
(a) length p, in case g1, g2, . . . , gp are not all equal, or
(b) length 1, in case g1 = g2 = · · · = gp = g, i.e., gp = e.
Thus, # of orbits of length 1 = # of solutions of gp = e in G. By Theorem 1.3.2 (2),
|G|p−1 = |X| = p(# of orbits of length p) + 1(# of orbits of length 1).
Since p divides |G|, it follows that |{g ∈G : gp = e}| > 1 is a multiple of p.

(k1, h1)(k2, h2) = (k1(h1k2), h1h2)
and deﬁne 1 = (1, 1) – the units of K and H, respectively. Verify that this deﬁnes a group such that
h 7→(1, h) is a monomorphism of H into K × H and k 7→(k, 1) is a monomorphism of K into K × H
whose image is a normal subgroup. This group is called a semi-direct product of K by H and is denoted
by K ⋊H.

Quotient Groups and Cyclic Groups
This section contains a construction of a new group using a normal subgroup, called a quotient
group. We also work on an important kind of subgroups of G which are generated by a single
element. We conclude this section by studying the group of automorphisms of G.
1.4.1
Quotient Groups
Suppose G is any group and N is a normal subgroup of G. Then for any g ∈G,
N = gNg−1
or
Ng = gN.
In other words, every left coset of N in G is also a right coset of N in G. If we have two left cosets
of N in G;
Nx = {ax : a ∈N}
and
Ny = {by : b ∈N},
then NxNy = {axby : a, b ∈N} = N(xN)y = N(Nx)y = Nxy is again a left coset of N in G.
Thus
NxNy = Nxy
deﬁnes a binary operation on the set G/N = {Nx : x ∈G} of left cosets of N in G.
Theorem 1.4.1. [Quotient Groups] Suppose G is a group and N is a normal subgroup of G. Let
G = S Nxα be a decomposition of G as a disjoint union of left (or right) cosets. Then the binary
operation
NxαNxβ = Nxαxβ
makes the set of left cosets of N into a group, called the quotient or factor group of G by the
normal subgroup N. This group is denoted by G/N. The map π : G →G/N deﬁned by
π(x) = Nx
is a group homomorphism whose kernel is N, called the canonical projection.
We have the following observations on the above construction:
1. If H is a subgroup of G which is not normal, then the set of left cosets of H in G does not
form a group in any natural way. For example, if G = S3 and H = ⟨(12)⟩= {(1), (12)}, then
H is not normal in G and {H, H(13), H(23)} is not a group because
H(13)H(23) = {(13), (132)}{(23), (123)} = {(132), (12), (13), (1)}
which is not one of the cosets.
2. |G/N| = [G : N], the index of N in G.
3. If G is abelian written additively, then
G/N = {N + x : x ∈G}
and the binary operation on G/N is given by
(N + x) + (N + y) = N + (x + y)
for all x, y ∈G.
We now present three group isomorphism theorems.
Theorem 1.4.2. [First Isomorphism Theorem] Suppose ϕ : G →H is a group homomorphism.
Then G/(ker ϕ) ∼= im ϕ.

1.4. Quotient Groups and Cyclic Groups
19
Proof. By Theorem 1.2.4, im ϕ is a subgroup of H and ker ϕ is a normal subgroup of G, and so
G/(ker ϕ) is a group. Let ϕ : G/ ker ϕ →im ϕ by ϕ : x(ker ϕ) 7→ϕ(x). Then for all x, y ∈G,
ϕ(x(ker ϕ)) = ϕ(y(ker ϕ)) ⇔ϕ(x) = ϕ(y) ⇔xy−1 ∈ker ϕ ⇔x(ker ϕ) = y(ker ϕ),
so ϕ is well deﬁned and 1-1. In addition, for all x, y ∈G,
ϕ(x(ker ϕ)y(ker ϕ)) = ϕ(xy(ker ϕ)) = ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y) = ϕ(x(ker ϕ))ϕ(y(ker ϕ)).
Moreover, ϕ is clearly onto. Hence, ϕ is an isomorphism.
Examples 1.4.1. Z/nZ ∼= Zn, Dn/Rn ∼= Z2, R/Z ∼= S1 and GLn(F)/SLn(F) ∼= F ∖{0}.
Let G
θ
/ H
ϕ
/ K be a sequence of group homomorphisms. We say that it is exact at H
if im θ = ker ϕ. A short exact sequence of groups is a sequence of groups and homomorphisms
1
/ G
θ
/ H
ϕ
/ K
/ 1
which is exact at G, H and K. That is, θ is injective, ϕ is surjective and im θ = ker ϕ. Here, 1
stands for the smallest group of order one.
Remark. If N is a normal subgroup of G, then
1
/ N
ι
/ G
π
/ G/N
/ 1
is exact. Here ι denotes the inclusion map. On the other hand, if N ≤G and
1
/ N
ι
/ G
/ H
/ 1
is exact, then N is normal in G and H ∼= G/N. Thus short exact sequences are just another notation
for normal subgroups and factor groups.
Theorem 1.4.3. [Second Isomorphism Theorem] Suppose G is a group and H and N are sub-
groups of G, with N normal in G. Then HN = NH is a subgroup of G in which N is normal,
H ∩N is normal in H and H/(H ∩N) ∼= HN/N.
Proof. Since N is normal in G, hN = Nh for all h ∈H, so HN ⊆NH and NH ⊆HN. Thus,
NH = HN. It is routine to show that NH is a subgroup of G. Since N ⊴G, N ⊴NH. The
theorem follows from exactness of the sequence
1
/ H ∩N
ι
/ H
ϕ
/ HN/N
/ 1 ,
where the homomorphism ϕ : h 7→hN for all h ∈H and ker ϕ = {h ∈H : hN = N} = {h ∈H :
h ∈N} = H ∩N.
Remark. If H and N are not normal in G, then HN may not be a subgroup of G.
E.g.,
in S3, the subgroups H = {(1), (12)} and N = {(1), (13)} are not normal in S3 and HN =
{(1), (12), (13), (132)} is not a subgroup of S3.
Theorem 1.4.4. [Third Isomorphism Theorem] Suppose G is a group and N is a normal sub-
group of G. Then the map
θ : H 7→H/N
gives a 1-1 correspondence
{ subgroups of G containing N } ←→{ subgroups of G/N }.
This correspondence carries normal subgroups to normal subgroups. Moreover, if H is normal in G
containing a subgroup N, then
G/H ∼= (G/N)/(H/N).

20
1. Groups
Proof. Let H1 and H2 be subgroups of G containing N and assume that H1/N = H2/N. Let
x ∈H1. Then Nx ∈H1/N = H2/N, so Nx = Ny for some y ∈H2. Thus, xy−1 ∈N ⊆H2. Since
y ∈H2, x ∈H2. Hence, H1 ⊆H2. By symmetry, H2 ⊆H1. Therefore, H1 = H2 and θ is 1-1.
Next, let H ≤G/N. Then {N} ⊆H. Choose H = S H, the union of cosets in H. Thus, N ⊆H.
Let x, y ∈H. Then Nx, Ny ∈H, so Nxy−1 ∈H which implies xy−1 ∈H. Thus, H is a subgroup
of G containing N and H = H/N. Hence, θ is onto.
Assume that H is a normal subgroup of G containing N. Let g ∈G and x ∈H. Then
gxg−1 ∈H, so gNxNg−1N = gxg−1N ∈H/N. Hence, H/N is normal subgroup of G/N.
The ﬁnal isomorphism follows from exactness of the sequence
1
/ H/N
ι
/ G/N
ϕ
/ G/H
/ 1 ,
where the homomorphism ϕ : gN 7→gH for all g ∈G which is well deﬁned because N ⊆H, and
ker ϕ = {gN : g ∈G and gH = H} = {gN : g ∈H} = H/N.
Remark. The above theorem is useful for obtaining subgroups and normal subgroups of a quo-
tient group. It plays an important role in the study of normal series of groups and nilpotent groups
as we shall see in Chapter 3.
1.4.2
Cyclic Groups
Recall that a cylic subgroup of G is a subgroup of G generated by a singleton. It has a simple
structure and is easy to construct. Its properties depend mostly on the group of integer modulo n.
We shall go deep inside the groups Zn and Z×
n in this section. We recall from Examples 1.2.1 that:
Theorem 1.4.5. Let n ≥2 and Z×
n = {¯a : gcd(a, n) = 1}. Then (Z×
n , ·) is an abelian group of
order φ(n), the Euler φ-function.
Example 1.4.2. Z×
10 = {¯1, ¯3, ¯7, ¯9} and Z×
p = {¯1, ¯2, . . . , p −1} where p is a prime.
Now we study cyclic subgroups of a group G. Recall that if G is a group and a ∈G, then
⟨a⟩= {am : m ∈Z} and the order of a is |a| = |⟨a⟩|.
Theorem 1.4.6. Let G be a group and a ∈G. Then
1. ∀n ∈N, an = e ⇒⟨a⟩= {e, a, a2, . . . , an−1}.
2. |a| is ﬁnite ⇔∃i, j ∈Z(i ̸= j ∧ai = aj) ⇔∃n ∈N, an = e.
3. |a| is inﬁnite ⇔∀i, j ∈Z(i ̸= j →ai ̸= aj) ⇔⟨a⟩∼= Z.
4. If G = ⟨a⟩is inﬁnite, then a and a−1 are only two generators of G.
5. If G is ﬁnite, then |a| = min{n ∈N : an = e} and ⟨a⟩= {e, a, a2, . . . , a|a|−1} ∼= Z|a|.
6. ∀n ∈Z, an = e ⇒|a| divides n.
7. If G is ﬁnite, then a|G| = e.
Proof. (1)–(3) are clear.
(4) Assume that G = ⟨a⟩is inﬁnite and am is a generator of G for some m ∈Z. Then ⟨am⟩= ⟨a⟩,
so a = (am)k for some k ∈Z. Since |a| is inﬁnite, mk = 1. Thus, m | 1, so m = ±1.
(5) Assume that G is ﬁnite. Then an = e for some n ∈N. Choose n0 to be the smallest such n.
Thus, an0 = e. We shall show that ⟨a⟩= {e, a, a2, . . . , an0−1}. Clearly, {e, a, a2, . . . , an0−1} ⊆⟨a⟩.
Let j ∈Z. Then j = n0q + r for some q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < n0, so aj = an0q+r = ar ∈
{e, a, a2, . . . , an0−1}. Hence, |a| = n0 = min{n ∈N : an = e} and a|a| = e. Finally, an isomorphism
is given by aj 7→j for all j ∈Z.
(6) Let n ∈Z and an = e. By the division algorithm, n = |a|q+r for some q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < |a|.

1.4. Quotient Groups and Cyclic Groups
21
If r > 0, then e = an = a|a|q+r = ar which contradicts the minimality of |a|. Hence, r = 0 and so
|a| divides n.
(7) By Lagrange, |a| divides |G|, so |G| = |a|q for some q ∈Z. Then a|G| = a|a|q = e.
The above results for the group Z×
n yield famous results below.
Corollary 1.4.7.
1. [Euler] If a ∈Z and gcd(a, n) = 1, then aφ(n) ≡1 (mod n).
2. [Fermat] If p is a prime, then ap ≡a (mod p) for all a ∈Z.
Proof. (1) Apply the above theorem to G = Z×
n .
(2) If gcd(a, p) = 1, then by (1), ap−1 ≡1 (mod p), so ap ≡a (mod p). If gcd(a, p) > 1, then
p | a, so p | (ap −a). Hence, ap ≡a (mod p) for all a ∈Z.
Theorem 1.4.8. Any two cyclic groups of the same orders (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) are isomorphic.
Proof. Assume that G is cyclic. Then G = ⟨a⟩for some a ∈G. By Theorem 1.4.6, if G is inﬁnite,
then G ∼= Z, and if G is ﬁnite, then |G| = |a| and G = {e, a, . . . , a|a|−1} ∼= Z|a|.
Next, we study subgroups of a cyclic group.
Theorem 1.4.9. [Subgroups of a Cyclic Group] Let G be a cyclic group generated by a, and let H
be a subgroup of G. Then H is also a cyclic group generated by ak where k = min{m ∈N : am ∈
H} or H = {e}. Consequently, every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.
Proof. Since ak ∈H, ⟨ak⟩⊆H. Let x ∈H. Then x ∈G, so x = at for some t ∈Z. By the division
algorithm, t = kq + r for some q, r ∈Z and 0 ≤r < k. Thus,
ar = at−kq = ata−kq = x(ak)−q ∈H.
But r < k, so r = 0. Hence, x = akq = (ak)q ∈⟨ak⟩.
Corollary 1.4.10. All distinct subgroups of Z are kZ = {kq : q ∈Z} where k ∈N ∪{0}.
Theorem 1.4.11. [Generators of a Subgroup of a Finite Cyclic Group] Let G be a ﬁnite cyclic
group of order n. Then G has exactly one subgroup H of order d for each divisor d of n, and no
other subgroups. Moreover, if G is generated by a, then H is generated by an/d.
Proof. Let d | n. Since (an/d)d = e, |an/d| ≤d. If |an/d| = r < d, then anr/d = e and nr/d < n
which contradicts |a| = n. Thus, |an/d| = d. Let H be a subgroup of G of order d. If d = 1, then
H = {e}. Assume that d > 1. By Theorem 1.4.9, H = ⟨ak⟩, where k = min{m ∈N : am ∈H}.
Since |H| = d, (ak)d = e, so n | kd which implies n
d | k. Thus, k = n
dq for some q ∈Z. Hence,
ak = (an/d)q ∈⟨an/d⟩. It follows that H ⊆⟨an/d⟩. However, |H| = d = |⟨an/d⟩|, so H = ⟨an/d⟩.

1. Groups
The order of an element in a cyclic group and its generators are studied in the next theorem.
Theorem 1.4.12. [Order of an Element] Let G be a ﬁnite cyclic group of order n generated by a
and m ∈Z. Then
1. ⟨am⟩= ⟨ad⟩, where d = gcd(m, n).
2. |am| =
n
gcd(m, n).
3. am is a generator of G ⇔gcd(m, n) = 1, and so G contains precisely φ(n) elements of
order n.
Proof. (1) Since d | m, ⟨am⟩⊆⟨ad⟩. Since d = gcd(m, n), d = mx + ny for some x, y ∈Z, so
ad = amx+ny = amxany = amx ∈⟨am⟩.
(2) |am| = |⟨am⟩| = |⟨ad⟩| = |⟨an/(n/d)⟩| = n
d from Theorem 1.4.11.
(3) ⟨am⟩= G ⇔|am| = n ⇔n
d = n ⇔d = 1.
Remark. Since Zn = ⟨1⟩and m · 1 = m, we have ⟨m⟩= Zn ⇔gcd(m, n) = 1 ⇔m ∈Z×
n .
Theorem 1.4.13. Let G be a group and a ∈G. Then |a| = n ⇔(∀k ∈N, ak = e ⇔n | k).
Proof. Assume that ∀k ∈N, ak = e ⇔n | k. Since n | n, an = e. Let k ∈N be such that ak = e.
Then n | k, so n ≤k. Hence, |a| = n. Another direction follows from Theorem 1.4.6 (6).
Recall that an automorphism of a group G is an isomorphism on G. The set of all automor-
phisms of a group G is denoted by Aut G and is called the automorphism group of G. We shall
close this section by studying the group of automorphisms of G and determining the automor-
phism group of cyclic groups.
Theorem 1.4.14. [Inner Automorphisms]
1. With group operation composition of functions, Aut G is a group.
2. Each g ∈G determines an automorphism φg : G →G deﬁned by
φg(x) = gxg−1 for all x ∈G,
and φg is called an inner automorphism. The subgroup of Aut G consisting of the {φg : g ∈
G} is called the inner automorphism group of G and is denoted by Inn G.
3. The map θ : g 7→φg is a group homomorphism from G into Aut G.
4. The kernel of θ is Z(G), the center of G, and the image of θ is Inn G. Consequently,
G/Z(G) ∼= Inn G ≤Aut G.
Example 1.4.4. Aut Z ∼= Z2 and Aut Zn ∼= Z×
n .
Proof. Let ϕ ∈Aut Z. Note that for each k ∈N, ϕ(k) = ϕ(k · 1) = ϕ(1 + · · · + 1
|
{z
}
k
) = k · ϕ(1)
and ϕ(−k) = −ϕ(k) = −(k · ϕ(1)), so ϕ is completely determined by ϕ(1). Since ϕ is onto,
im ϕ = ϕ(1)Z = Z. Thus, ϕ(1) | 1, so ϕ(1) = ±1. Hence, Aut Z = {±id} ∼= Z2.
Let ϕ ∈Aut Zn. Similarly, ϕ is completely determined by ϕ(1). Since ϕ is onto, im ϕ =
⟨ϕ(1)⟩= Zn.
By Remark after Theorem 1.4.12, ϕ(1) ∈Z×
n .
Therefore, Aut Zn ∼= Z×
n with
isomorphism ϕ 7→ϕ(1).

1.5
The Symmetric Group
In this section, we study the symmetric group on n letters, Sn. Recall that Sn is the group of
permutations (1-1 and onto maps) on {1, 2, . . . , n} under composition. Its order is n!.
A permutation γ of {1, 2, . . . , n} which permutes a sequence of distinct elements i1, i2, . . . , ir,
r > 1, cyclically in the sense that
γ(i1) = i2, γ(i2) = i3, . . . , γ(ir−1) = ir, and γ(ir) = i1
and ﬁxed (that is, leaves unchanged) the other numbers in {1, 2, . . . , n} is called a cycle or an
r-cycle. We denote this as
γ = (i1i2 . . . ir).
It is clear that we can equally well write
γ = (i2i3 . . . iri1) = (i3i4 . . . iri1i2), etc.

24
1. Groups
Two cycles γ and γ′ are said to be disjoint if their symbols contain no common letters. In
this case, it is clear that any number moved by one of these transformations is ﬁxed by the other,
i.e., ∀i, γ(i) ̸= i ⇒γ′(i) = i. Hence, if i is any number such that γ(i) ̸= i, then γγ′(i) = γ(i),
and since also γ2(i) ̸= γ′(i), γ′γ(i). Similarly, if γ′(i) ̸= i, then γ′γ(i) = γ′(i) = γγ′(i). Also if
γ(i) = i = γ′(i), then γγ′(i) = γ′γ(i). Thus γγ′ = γ′γ, that is, we have proved (1) of the following
theorem.
Theorem 1.5.1. [Order of a Cycle]
1. Any two disjoint cycles commute.
2. If γ = (i1i2 . . . ir) is an r-cycle, then the order of γ is r.
3. If α = (i1i2 . . . ir1)(j1j2 . . . jr2) . . . (k1k2 . . . krs) is a product of disjoint cycles, then the order
of α is the least common multiple of r1, r2, . . . , rs.
Proof. For (2), clearly, γr = (1). Let 1 ≤s < r. Then γs(i1) = is+1 ̸= i1, so γs ̸= (1). (3)
follows from (2) and the fact that |ab| = lcm(|a|, |b|) for all a, b ∈G such that ab = ba and
∀m ∈N, ambm = e ⇒am = bm = e (see Exercises 1.4).
It is convenient to extend the deﬁnition of cycles and the cycle notation to 1-cycles where we
adopt the convention that for any i, (i) is the identity mapping. With this convention, we can see
that:
Theorem 1.5.2. [Decomposition of a Permutation] Every permutation is a product of disjoint
cycles. Moreover, the product is unique up to rearranging its cycles and cyclically permuting the
numbers within each cycle.
Proof. Let σ ∈Sn. If σ = (1), we are done. Assume that σ ̸= 1. Let G = ⟨σ⟩act on {1, 2, . . . , n
naturally as in Examples 1.3.1 (1). Let B1, B2, . . . , Br be distinct orbits of {1, 2, . . . , n} under this
action. For each j ∈{1, 2, . . . , r}, we deﬁne the cycle µi by
µi(x) =
(
σ(x),
if x ∈Bi;
x,
if x ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} ∖Bi.
Since Bi, i = 1, 2, . . . , r, are disjoint, µi are disjoint cycles, and clearly, σ = µ1µ2 . . . µr.
Remark. The above two theorems tell us how to ﬁnd the order of an element in Sn.
Next, we shall discuss the cycle structure and the conjugacy class of a permutation.
Lemma 1.5.3. If α ∈Sn is a permutation, then
α(i1i2 . . . ir)α−1 = (α(i1)α(i2) . . . α(ir)).
Proof. For x ∈{1, 2, . . . , n},
α(i1i2 . . . ir)(x) =
(
α(im+1
mod r),
if x = im
mod r;
α(x),
if x /∈{i1, i2, . . . , ir}
=
(
α(im+1
mod r),
if α(x) = α(im
mod r);
α(x),
if α(x) /∈{α(i1), α(i2), . . . , α(ir)}
= (α(i1)α(i2) . . . α(ir))(α(x)).
Hence, α(i1i2 . . . ir) = (α(i1)α(i2) . . . α(ir))α.

1.5. The Symmetric Group
25
If σ ∈Sn is the product of disjoint cycles of lengths r1, r2, . . . , rs with r1 ≤r2 ≤. . . ≤rs
(including its 1-cycles) then the integers r1, r2, . . . , rs are called the cycle structure of σ.
A partition of a positive integer n is any nondecreasing sequence of positive integers whose
sum is n. For example, 5 has seven partitions, namely, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 2,
1 + 1 + 3, 1 + 4, 2 + 3 and 5. The following result shows that the number of conjugacy classes of
Sn and the number of partitions of n are coincide.
Theorem 1.5.4. Two elements of Sn are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure.
The number of conjugacy classes of Sn equals the number of partitions of n.
Proof. Assume that σ and τ are conjugate. Then τ = ασα−1 for some τ ∈Sn. Write
σ = (i1i2 . . . ir1)(j1j2 . . . jr2) . . . (k1k2 . . . krs)
as a product of disjoint cycles. Thus,
τ = ασα−1 = α(i1i2 . . . ir1)α−1α(j1j2 . . . jr2)α−1α(k1k2 . . . krs)α−1
= (α(i1)α(i2) . . . α(ir1))(α(j1)α(j2) . . . α(jr2))(α(k1)α(k2) . . . α(krs)).
Hence, σ and τ have the same cycle structure.
Conversely, suppose that σ and τ have the same cycle structure written as a product of s
disjoint cycles (including 1-cycles) as
σ = (a1a2 . . . ar1)(ar1+1ar1+2 . . . ar1+r2) . . . (ar1+r2+···+rs−1+1 . . . an−1an)
and
τ = (b1b2 . . . br1)(br1+1br1+2 . . . br1+r2) . . . (br1+r2+···+rs−1+1 . . . bn−1bn).
Deﬁne α ∈Sn by α(ai) = bi for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Then ασα−1 = τ.
Example 1.5.1. The number of conjugacy classes of S5 is 7 and
|{α(12)(345)α−1 : α ∈S5}| =
 5
2

(3 −1)! = 20.
Example 1.5.2. The Klein group V4 = {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)} is normal in S4 because
V4 contains of all products of disjoint 2-cycles and so ∀α ∈S4, αV4α−1 = V4 by Theorem 1.5.4.
Moreover, since the group {(1), (12)(34)} is of index two in V4, it is normal in V4 by Theorem
1.3.3. However, {(1), (12)(34)} is not normal in S4. Thus, normality of subgroups is not transitive.
Corollary 1.5.5. [Center of Sn] If n ≥3, then the center of Sn is trivial, i.e., Z(Sn) = {(1)}.
Proof. We wish to prove that ∀α ∈Sn[∀β ∈Sn, βαβ−1 = α ⇒α = (1)]. By Theorem 1.5.4,
∀α ∈Sn[α ̸= (1) ⇒|{βαβ−1 : β ∈Sn}| > 1]. By Corollary 1.3.8,∀α ∈Sn[|{βαβ−1 : β ∈Sn}| >
1 ⇒α /∈Z(Sn)]. Hence, let α ∈Z(Sn). Then |{βαβ−1 : α ∈Sn}| = 1, so α = (1).
To deﬁne an important subgroup of Sn, namely the alternating group, we shall need some
results on 2-cycles. A cycle of the form (ab), where a ̸= b, is called a transposition. It is easy to
verify that
(i1i2 . . . ir) = (i1ir) . . . (i1i3)(i1i2),
a product of r −1 transpositions. It follows that any α ∈Sn is a product of transpositions. Also, a
transposition (ab) has order two in Sn.
Theorem 1.5.6.
1. (1) is always a product of even number of transpositions.
2. If α ∈Sn is written as a product of transpositions, then either the number of transpositions
in any product is always odd or always even.

26
1. Groups
Proof. (1) Assume that we have two transposition decompositions
(1) = (x1y1)(x2y2) . . . (xkyk) = (1x1)(1y1)(1x1)(1x2)(1y2)(1x2) . . . (1xk)(1yk)(1xk)
with xi < yi for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , k}. Consider any (1u), u > 1, in the right hand side. Since
the opposite side is (1), (1u) must occur twice (or even number of times) in the right hand side.
Note that (1 7→u and u 7→1) will give u 7→u. Thus each transposition in the right hand side
occurs even numbers of times, which implies that the right hand side should have even number
of transpositions. Hence, k is even.
(2) Assume
α = (x1y1)(x2y2) . . . (xkyk) = (w1z1)(w2z2) . . . (wlzl)
for some xi ̸= yi, wj ̸= zj and k, l ∈N. Since |(wizi)| = 2 for all i,
(x1y1)(x2y2) . . . (xkyk)(wlzl)−1(wl−1zl−1)−1 . . . (w1z1)−1 = (1)
(x1y1)(x2y2) . . . (xkyk)(wlzl)(wl−1zl−1) . . . (w1z1) = (1),
so k + l is even. Hence, k and l have the same parity.
The previous theorem leads to the deﬁnition of parity of a permutation. We call the per-
mutation α even or odd according as α factors as a product of an even or an odd number of
transpositions.
Remarks. Let α, β ∈Sn.
1. αβ is even ⇔α and β have the same parity.
2. Since αα−1 = (1) which is even, α and α−1 have the same parity.
Theorem 1.5.7. Let n > 1. The set An of all even permutations forms a normal subgroup of Sn of
index two. It is called the alternating group of degree n and |An| = n!/2.
Proof. By Theorem 1.5.6, (1) is even. It is clear that the product of even permutations is even.
Since a transposition has order two, the inverse of an even permutation is even. Hence, An is a
subgroup of Sn. Since n > 1, let (ab) be a transposition in Sn. Clearly, (ab) is an odd permutation.
We will show that Sn = An ∪(ab)An. Let α ∈Sn. If α is even, then α ∈An. On the other hand,
assume that α is odd. Then (ab)α is even, so (ab)α ∈An, i.e., α ∈(ab)An. Thus, [Sn : An] = 2. In
addition, since α and α−1 have the same parity, αAnα−1 ⊆An. Hence, An is normal in Sn.
The above proof also shows that if n > 1, then Sn = An ∪(ab)An and the number of even
permutations and odd permutations are the same.
Corollary 1.5.8. Let a group G act on a ﬁnite set X, and assume that some element h ∈G induces
an odd permutation on X. Then there exists a normal subgroup N of G with [G : N] = 2 and
h /∈N.
Proof. Consider the diagram
G
θ
/ S(X)
π
/ S(X)/A(X) ,
where A(X) is the alternating group of even permutations on X, θ : g →φg and π is the canonical
map. Since φh is an odd permutation, π ◦θ is onto. Choose N = ker π ◦θ. Then N ⊳G and
G/N ∼= S(X)/A(X). Thus, [G : N] = [S(X) : A(X)] = 2. Since (π ◦θ)(h) = φhA(X) ̸= A(X), we
have h /∈N.

1.5. The Symmetric Group
27
Finally, we talk about the simplicity of An. A group is simple if it has no nontrivial normal
subgroup. That is, all normal subgroups of G are {e} and G. For example, Zp is simple for all
primes p.
Corollary 1.5.9. Let |G| = 2m, where m is odd. Then G has a normal subgroup of order m. In
particular, if m > 1, then G is not simple.
Proof. Since |G| is even, let g be an element of order two in G. Let G act on G by left multiplication
and consider G
θ→S(G). Since the action is faithful, θ is 1-1, so |θ(g)| = 2. Thus, θ(g) = φg is
an odd permutation. By the previous corollary, there exists a normal subgroup N of G such that
[G : N] = 2. Hence, G is not simple.
Example 1.5.3. Since the Klein group V4 = {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)} is normal in A4, it
follows that A4 is not simple.
In general, we have the next theorem.
Theorem 1.5.10. An is simple for all n ̸= 4.
Proof. Clearly, A2 and A3 are simple. For n ≥5, we give a step-by-step guideline in Project 5.
Corollary 1.5.11. If n ̸= 4, then the only normal subgroups of Sn are {(1)}, An and Sn.

and
(r, s, i)2(r, s, k)(r, s, j)2(r, s, i).
Observe that these products give all possible types of 3-cycles.]
(d) Let N be a normal subgroup of An for n ≥3. Show that if N contains a 3-cycle, then N = An. [Hint.
Show that (r, s, i) ∈N implies that (r, s, j) ∈N for j = 1, 2, . . . , n by computing
((r, s)(i, j))(r, s, i)2((r, s)(i, j))−1.]
(e) Let N be a nontrivial normal subgroup of An for n ≥5. Show that one of the following cases must
hold, and conclude in each case that N = An.

Project 6 (Wilson). Let p be a prime. Taking G = Sp in the proof of Cauchy’s theorem (Theorem 1.3.12),
we see that the set {σ ∈Sp : σp = (1)} is of cardinality a multiple of p. Count the number of elements in
this set and deduce that (p −1)! ≡−1 (mod p). This provides another proof of Wilson’s theorem.
1.6
Sylow Theorems
We know the order of a subgroup of a ﬁnite group G must divide |G|. If |G| is cyclic (even only
abelian), then there exist subgroups of every order dividing |G|. A natural question is: If k divides
|G| is there always a subgroup of G of order k? A little experimenting shows that this is not so. For
example, the alternating group A4, whose order is 12, contain no subgroup of order six. Moreover,
An for n ≥5 is simple, that is, contains no normal subgroup ̸= 1, An. Since any subgroup of index
two is normal, it follows that An, n ≥5, contains no subgroup of order n!/4.
1.6.1
Sylow p-subgroups
The main positive result of the type we are discussing was discovered by Sylow /see lov/. Its
proof provides us another application of action of a group on a set. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, p
denotes a prime.
A group G is said to be a p-group if |a| is a power of p for all a ∈G.
Example 1.6.1. The group Zpn is a p-group. If X is a set, then (P(X), △) is a 2-group.
Since we mainly study ﬁnite groups, the following corollary will be useful. Lagrange theorem
and Cauchy theorem imply each direction, respectively.
Corollary 1.6.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group. Then G is a p-group ⇔|G| is a power of p.
Remark. Let P and Q be subgroups of G. If P is a p-group and Q is a q-group, where p and q are
distinct primes, then P ∩Q = {e}.
Theorem 1.6.2. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group and |G| > 1. Then the following statements hold.
1. |Z(G)| > 1.
2. If |G| = p2, then G is abelian.
Proof. By Corollary 1.6.1, |G| = pl for some l ∈N. Recall from Corollary 1.3.8 that
|G| = |Z(G)| +
s
X
i=1
|{gxig−1 : g ∈G}| = |Z(G)| +
s
X
i=1
[G : CG(xi)],

1.6. Sylow Theorems
29
where x1, . . . , xs represent the conjugacy classes of G which contains more than one element.
Since [G : CG(xi)] = |G|/|CG(xi)| > 1 for all i and |G| = pl, p divides |{gxig−1 : g ∈G}| for all
i ∈{1, 2, . . . , s}. Hence, p | |Z(G)|, so |Z(G)| > 1. This proves (1). For the second part, assume
that |G| = p2. We know that Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G and |Z(G)| > 1. By Lagrange
Theorem, |Z(G)| = p or |Z(G)| = p2. If |Z(G)| = p2, we have Z(G) = G and so G is abelian.
Suppose that |Z(G)| = p. Then G/Z(G) is of order p and so a cyclic group. This implies that G is
abelian.
Because all subgroups of a p-group have p-power index, the length of an orbit under an action
by a p-group is a multiple of p unless the point is a ﬁxed point, when its orbit has length one. This
leads to an important congruence modulo p when a p-group is acting.
Lemma 1.6.3. [Fixed Point Congruence] Let G be a ﬁnite p-group.
If G acts on a ﬁnite set X and X0 = {x ∈X : gx = x for all g ∈G}, then |X0| ≡|X| mod p.
Here, X0 is called the set of ﬁxed points.
Proof. We observe ﬁrst that X0 = {x ∈X : |G · x| = 1}. Let x1, . . . , xs represent the orbits of X
which contains more than one element. Then
|X| = |X0| +
s
X
i=1
|G · xi|.
By Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, for each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , s}, 1 < |G · xi| = [G : StabG xi] which is
divisible by p. Hence, |X0| ≡|X| mod p as desired.
Lemma 1.6.4. Let G be a ﬁnite group and H, P ≤G. If H is a p-group, then
1. |{xP : x ∈G and H ⊆xPx−1}| ≡[G : P] mod p,
2. [NG(H) : H] ≡[G : H] mod p, and
3. if p | [G : H], then p | [NG(H) : H] and NG(H) ̸= H.
Proof. Let X = {xP : x ∈G} and let H act on X by h · xP = hxP for all x ∈G and h ∈H.
Clearly, |X| = [G : P] and
X0 = {xP : x ∈G and hxP = xP for all h ∈H}
= {xP : x ∈G and x−1hx ∈P for all h ∈H}
= {xP : x ∈G and x−1Hx ⊆P} = {xP : x ∈G and H ⊆xPx−1},
so |{xP : x ∈G and H ⊆xPx−1}| ≡[G : P] mod p by Lemma 1.6.3. Furthermore, if P = H, we
have
X0 = {xH : x ∈G and H ⊆xHx−1}.
Since ∀x ∈G, |xHx−1| = |H| and H is ﬁnite, we have
|X0| = |{xH : x ∈G and x−1Hx = H}| = |{xH : x ∈NG(H)}| = [NG(H) : H],
so [NG(H) : H] ≡[G : H] mod p . The ﬁnal result clearly follows from (2).
We now discuss three theorems due to Sylow. The ﬁrst theorem shows the existance of a
maximal p-subgroup of a ﬁnite group G.
Theorem 1.6.5. [First Sylow Theorem] Let G be a group of order pnm where n ≥1 and p does
not divide m. Then the following statements hold.
1. G contains a subgroup of order pi for all 1 ≤i ≤n.
2. For each i, where 1 ≤i < n, every subgroup H of G of order pi is a normal subgroup of a
subgroup of order pi+1.

30
1. Groups
Proof. Since p divides |G|, by Cauchy theorem, G has a subgroup H1 of order p. Assume that
k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n −1} and G has a subgroup Hk of order pk. Then the index [G : Hk] = pn−km and
n −k ≥1. By Lemma 1.6.4, p divides [NG(Hk) : Hk] = |NG(Hk)/Hk|. Again, by Cauchy theorem,
NG(Hk)/Hk has a subgroup H of order p. By the Third Isomorphism Theorem, H = Hk+1/Hk for
some subgroup Hk+1 of NG(Hk) containing Hk. Moreover, Hk ⊳Hk+1 and |Hk+1| = |H||Hk| =
p pk = pk+1. Hence, there are subgroups H1, H2, . . . , Hn of G such that |Hi| = pi for i = 1, 2, . . . , n
and H1 ⊳H2 ⊳· · · ⊳Hn.
A maximal p-subgroup of a group G is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G. By Zorn’s lemma, we
have the following statements.
1. A Sylow p-subgroup of a group G always exists and it may be trivial.
2. Every p-subgroup of a group G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
By Corollary 1.6.1 and Theorem 1.6.5, if G is a ﬁnite group and p is a prime such that p divides
|G|, then G has a Sylow p-subgroup of order pn∥|G|. (Here, pn∥|G| means n is the highest power
of p dividing |G|.) That is, [G : P] is not divisible by p. Moreover, we have:
Corollary 1.6.6. Let G be a group of order pnm where n ≥1 and p does not divide m.
1. G has a Sylow p-subgroup of order pn.
2. For H < G, H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G ⇔|H| = pn.
3. Every conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup of G is a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
4. If P is the only one Sylow p-subgroup of G, then P is normal in G.
Proof. (1) and (2) follow from the deﬁnition and the above discussion. Since a conjugate of a
subgroup of G is of the same order as the subgroup, (2) implies (3). Finally, (4) follows from
(3).
The second and third Sylow theorems determine all Sylow p-subgroups and possible numbers
of Sylow p-subgroups, respectively. Also, they give the converse of the above results.
Theorem 1.6.7. [Second Sylow Theorem] Let G be a ﬁnite group.
1. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and H is a p-subgroup of G, then H ⊆xPx−1 for some
x ∈G.
2. Any two Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate.
Proof. By Lemma 1.6.4 |{xP : x ∈G and H ⊆xPx−1}| ≡[G : P] mod p. Since P is a Sylow
p-subgroup of G, p ∤[G : P], so {xP : x ∈G and H ⊆xPx−1} ̸= ∅. Thus, there exists an x ∈G
such that H ⊆xPx−1.
Next, we let P1 and P2 be Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then there exists an x ∈G such that
P1 ⊆xP2x−1. But |P1| = |P2| = |xP2x−1| and G is ﬁnite, P1 = xP2x−1.
Corollary 1.6.8. Let G be a ﬁnite group and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
1. {xPx−1 : x ∈G} is the set of all Sylow p-subgroups of G.
2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of G is [G : NG(P)] and it divides [G : P] and |G|.
3. P is normal in G ⇔P is the only one Sylow p-subgroup of G.
For a ﬁnite group G and a prime p divides |G|, we write np(G) for the number of Sylow
p-subgroups of G.
Theorem 1.6.9. [Third Sylow Theorem] If G is a ﬁnite group and a prime p divides |G|, then
np(G) ≡1 mod p.

1.6. Sylow Theorems
31
Proof. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Then the set X = {xPx−1 : x ∈G} consists of all
Sylow p-subgroups of G. Let P act on X by conjugation, namely, (g, xPx−1) 7→gxPx−1g−1 for
all g ∈P and x ∈G. Since gPg−1 = P for all g ∈P, P ∈X0. Let Q ∈X0. Then gQg−1 = Q
for all g ∈P, so P ⊆NG(Q). Since P and Q are Sylow p-subgroups of NG(Q) and Q is normal
in NG(Q), P = Q by the uniqueness of normal Sylow p-subgroup. This proves X0 = {P}. By
Lemma 1.6.3, we have np(G) = |X| ≡|X0| = 1 mod p as desired.
1.6.2
Applications of Sylow Theorems
Here, we present some applications of Sylow theorems on a ﬁnite group. The proofs use basic
properties of subgroups, quotient groups, cyclic groups and symmetric groups studied previously.
We shall see many techniques in group theory in this subsection.
Theorem 1.6.10. Let G be a ﬁnite group. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then
NG(NG(P)) = NG(P).
Proof. Since P ⊳NG(P), P is the only Sylow p-subgroup of NG(P). Let x ∈NG(NG(P)). Then
xNG(P)x−1 = NG(P). Since P ⊆NG(P), xPx−1 ⊆NG(P). Thus, xPx−1 = P since xPx−1 is a
Sylow p-subgroup of G. Hence, x ∈NG(P).
Theorem 1.6.11. [Group of Order pq] Let G be a group of order pq where p and q are primes and
p < q. Then G is a cyclic group, or G has q Sylow p-subgroups and p | (q −1).
Proof. Since the number of Sylow p-subgroups divides |G| = pq, it is 1, p, q or pq. But this number
is ≡1 mod p, so it is 1 or q. If G has q Sylow p-subgroups, then we are done. Assume that G
has only one Sylow p-subgroup, say P. Then P is normal in G. Consider the number of Sylow
q-subgroups of G. It is again 1, p, q or pq, and ≡1 mod q, so the only possibility is 1 since p < q.
Thus, G also has a unique Sylow q-subgroup, say Q, and so Q is normal in G. Since the orders of
P and Q are prime, both P and Q are cyclic. Let a and b be generators of P and Q, respectively.
Note that aba−1b−1 ∈P ∩Q = {e}. Thus, ab = ba, so |ab| = pq = |G|. Hence, G = ⟨ab⟩.
Remark. Theorem 1.6.11 demonstrates the power of the Sylow theorems in classifying the ﬁnite
groups whose orders have small numbers of prime factor. Results along this lines of this theorem
exist for groups of order p2q, p2q2, p3 and p4, where p < q are primes.
Example 1.6.2. There can be no simple groups of order 200 and of order 280.
Proof. Let H be a group of order 200. Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup of H. Then n5(H) divides
[H : P] = 8 and n5(H) ≡1 (mod 5), so n5(H) = 1. Hence, P is normal in H.
Next, let G be a group of order 280. By Corollary 1.6.8 and Theorem 1.6.9, we have n2(G) =
1, 5, 7 or 35, n5(G) = 1 or 56 and n7(G) = 1 or 8. If n5(G) = 1 or n7(G) = 1, we are done. Assume
that n5(G) = 56 and n7(G) = 8. Then we have 56 · 4 = 224 elements of order 5, and 8 · 6 = 48
elements of order 7. Hence, G has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup.
Example 1.6.3. Let G be a group of order 30. Then
1. Either a Sylow 3-subgroup or a Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in G.
2. G has a normal subgroup of order 15.
3. Both a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup are normal in G.

32
1. Groups
Proof. Assume that neither a Sylow 3-subgroup nor a Sylow 5-subgroup are normal in G. By
Corollary 1.6.8, n3(G) and n5(G) are more than one and are factors of |G|. By Third Sylow
Theorem, n3(G) ≥10 and n5(G) ≥6, so G contains at least 20 elements of order three and at
least 24 elements of order ﬁve. This exceeds the number of elements of G, a contradiction. Thus,
we have (1). Now, let P3 and P5 be a Sylow 3-subgroup and a Sylow 5-subgroup of G, respectively.
By (1), we see that P3 or P5 is normal in G, so P3P5 is a subgroup of G. Since P3 ∩P5 = {e},
|P3P5| = 15, so the index [G : P3P5] is two. Hence, P3P5 is normal in G. This proves (2).
Finally, we assume that P3 is normal while P5 is not. Thus, G has two elements of order
three at least 24 elements of order ﬁve. By Theorem 1.6.11, P3P5 is cyclic, so G has φ(15) = 8
elements of order 15. Hence, G contains more than 30 elements, a contradiction. On the other
hand, we assume that P5 is normal while P3 is not. Thus, G has four elements of order ﬁve at
least 20 elements of order three. Again, G also contains 8 elements of order 15. This leads to a
contradiction, so P3 and P5 are normal in G as desired.
Example 1.6.4. Every group G of order 12 that is not isomorphic with A4 contains an element of
order 6.
Proof. If A is a Sylow 3-subgroup, then A = ⟨a⟩and |a| = 3. Let G act on {A, x2A, x3A, x4A} by
(g, xA) 7→gxA. This action induces a homomorphism θ : G →S4 whose kernel K is a subgroup
of A. Then K = {e} or K = A. If K = {e}, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S4 of order
12, so G ∼= A4 which is excluded by hypothesis. Thus, A = K is normal in G which implies that
A is a unique Sylow 3-subgroup of G. Hence, a and a2 are only two elements of order 3 in G.
Since [G : CG(a)] is the number of conjugates of a which is 1 or 2, |CG(a)| = 12 or 6, so there is a
b ∈CG(a) of order two. Since ab = ba, |ab| = 6.
Example 1.6.5. Recall that V4 = {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)} is a normal subgroup of A4.
Since |A4| = 12 = 22 · 3, V4 is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup of A4. Moreover V4 has three
subgroups of order two, namely ⟨(12)(34)⟩, ⟨(13)(24)⟩and ⟨(14)(23)⟩. Next, we analyze the Sylow
3-subgroups of A4. They are cyclic subgroups of order three generated by a 3-cycle. Note that
there are eight 3-cycles in A4, so we have four subgroups of order three, which are ⟨(123)⟩, ⟨(124)⟩,
⟨(134)⟩and ⟨(234)⟩. By Exercises 1.5, A4 has no subgroup of order six. Hence, the diagram below
shows all subgroups of A4.

in Z(G).
11. Show that there is no non-abelian ﬁnite simple group of order less than 60. (Hint. We may focus on
groups of the following orders: 24, 30, 40, 48, 54 and 56.)
12. Let G be a group of order 385. Show that a Sylow 11-subgroup of G is normal and a Sylow 7-subgroup
of G is contained in Z(G).

P ̸= gPg−1, then P ∩gPg−1 = {e}. Show that np(G) ≡1 mod |P|.
14. Let G be a group of order 2013. Prove that G has a proper normal subgroup N such that G/N is

15.
(a) Let G be a ﬁnite group and N a normal subgroup of G. If N contains a Sylow p-subgroup of

np(G)).
(b) Show that if G is a group of order 130, then G has a normal subgroup of order 5.
16. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting transitively on a ﬁnite set X. Let x ∈X and Gx the stabilizer of x.
Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of Gx. Show that the subgroup NG(P) = {z ∈G : zPz−1 = P} of G
acts transitively on Y = {y ∈X : hy = y for all h ∈P}.
Project 7 (Simple groups of small order). We have learned from the above exercise that the smallest non-
abelian simple group is of order 60 by using Sylow’s theorems to eliminate the groups of smaller order.
Write a computer program that uses Sylow’s theorems to eliminate all orders between 1 and say 1,000 (or
more) for which group that cannot be simple. For any order that could have a simple group G, list np(G)
for all primes p dividing the order.
Project 8 (Lucas’ congruence). Let p be a prime and let n ≥m be non-negative integers. Write n = pn′+a0

consecutive integers, from 1 to pn′, followed by a ﬁnal block of length a0. That is, let
Ai = {in′ + 1, in′ + 2, . . . , (i + 1)n′}
for 0 ≤i ≤p −1, so
{1, 2, . . . , n} = A0 ∪A1 ∪· · · ∪Ap−1 ∪{pn′ + 1, pn′ + 2, . . . , pn′ + a0}.
For 1 ≤t ≤n′, let σt be the p-cycle
σt = (t, n′ + t, 2n′ + t, . . . , (p −1)n′ + t).
This cycle cyclically permutes the numbers in A0, A1, . . . , Ap−1 that are ≡t (mod n′). The σt’s for different
t are disjoint, so they commute. Set σ = σ1σ2 . . . σn. Then σ has order p as a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}
(ﬁxing all numbers above pn′). Let X be the set of m-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Then |X| =

Finite Abelian Groups
The study of ﬁnite non-abelian groups is complicated as we have learned that the Sylow theorems
give us some important information about them. This section gives us complete information about
all ﬁnite abelian groups. We start with formal deﬁnitions of the direct product of groups.
Let A and B be groups. The direct product of A and B is deﬁned as:
1. a set A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈A and b ∈B} is the Cartesian product of A and B,
2. multiplication is coordinatewise, namely, (a, b)(c, d) = (ac, bd).
More generally, if {Ai : i ∈I} is a family of groups, then Q
i∈I Ai is a group with coordinatewise
multiplication. It is called the direct product of the groups Ai. The subgroup
Y
i∈I
wAi =
n
(ai) ∈
Y
i∈I
Ai : ai = e for all but ﬁnitely many i
o
of Q
i∈I Ai is called the external weak direct product of the groups Ai. Note that it is normal
in Q
i∈I Ai. In case Ai are all additive abelian groups, we may write P
i∈I Ai for Q
i∈I Ai and
Pw
i∈I Ai for Qw
i∈I Ai.
Let G be a group. It is easy to show that:
1. If N1, . . . , Nm are normal subgroups of G, then
N1N2 · · · Nm = ⟨N1 ∪N2 ∪· · · ∪Nm⟩.
2. If {Ni : i ∈I} is a family of normal subgroups of G, then
D[
i∈I
Ni
E
=
[
i1,...,im∈I,
m∈N
Ni1 · · · Nim.
Theorem 1.7.1. Let {Ni : i ∈I} be a family of normal subgroups of G such that
1. G =

S
i∈I Ni

and
2. ∀k ∈I, Nk ∩
DS
i∈I∖{k} Ni
E
= {e}.
Then G ∼= Qw
i∈I Ni.
The group G satisﬁes conditions of Theorem 1.7.1 is called the internal weak direct product
of {Ni : i ∈I} and we write G = Qw
i∈I Ni. If G is additive abelian, then G is called the internal
direct sum of {Ni : i ∈I} and we write G = L
i∈I Ni.
Corollary 1.7.2. Let N1, N2, . . . , Nm be normal subgroups of G. If G = N1 . . . Nm and
Nk ∩(N1 . . . Nk−1Nk+1 . . . Nm) = {e} for all k ∈{1, . . . , m}, then G ∼= N1 × · · · × Nm.
Proof of Theorem 1.7.1. From (2), for each i, j ∈I with i ̸= j, we have Ni ∩Nj = {e}, this implies
that xy = yx for all x ∈Ni and y ∈Nj because Ni and Nj are normal in G.
Deﬁne ϕ : Qw
i∈I Ni →G by
ϕ({ai}) =
Y
i∈I
ai
which is a ﬁnite product since ai = e for all but a ﬁnite number of i ∈I and it is a well deﬁned
homomorphism by the previous observation. To show that this map is onto, let x ∈G. Since

1.7. Finite Abelian Groups
35
G is generated by S
i∈I Ni, G = S
i1,...,im∈I,
m∈N
Ni1 · · · Nim, so there are distinct k1, . . . , kl ∈I and
a1 ∈Nk1, . . . , al ∈Nkl such that x = ak1 . . . akl. Let {xi} in Qw
i∈I Ni be deﬁned by xi = ai if
i ∈{k1, . . . , kl} and xi = e for other i. Then ϕ({xi}) = Q
i∈I xi = ak1 . . . akl = x as required.
Finally, we show that ϕ is injective, let {ai} ∈Qw
i∈I Ni be such that Q
i∈I ai = e. Then for each
k ∈I, a−1
k
= Q
i∈I∖{k} is in Nk ∩⟨S
i∈I∖{k} Ni⟩= {e}. This implies that ak = e for all k ∈I, and
hence ϕ is an isomorphism.
The proof of injectivitity above also implies the following theorems.
Theorem 1.7.3. Let N1, N2, . . . , Nm be normal subgroups of G. Then the following statements are
equivalent.
(i) G is the internal weak direct product of N1, . . . , Nm.
(ii) ∀x ∈G, ∃!a1 ∈N1, . . . , am ∈Nm, x = a1 . . . am.
Theorem 1.7.4. Let {Ni : i ∈I} be a family of normal subgroups of a group G. Then the following
statements are equivalent.
(i) G is the internal weak direct product of {Ni : i ∈I}.
(ii) ∀x ∈G ∖{e}, ∃!i1, . . . , im ∈I, ∃!ai1 ∈Ni1 ∖{e}, . . . , aim ∈Nim ∖{e}, x = ai1 . . . aim.
Corollary 1.7.5. [Internal Direct Product] Let G be a group. Suppose that A and B are normal
subgroups of G such that
1. A ∩B = {e}
2. AB = G
and
3. ∀a ∈A, b ∈B, ab = ba.
Then G ∼= A × B. In this case, we say that G is the internal direct product of A and B.
An application of the ﬁrst isomorphism theorem with the natural map gives the next results.
Theorem 1.7.6. Let {Gi : i ∈I} be a family of groups, and for i ∈I, let Ni be normal in Gi.
Then Q
i∈I Ni is normal in Q
i∈I Gi and Q
i∈I Gi/ Q
i∈I Ni ∼= Q
i∈I(Gi/Ni). Similarly, Qw
i∈I Ni is
normal in Qw
i∈I Gi and Qw
i∈I Gi/ Qw
i∈I Ni ∼= Qw
i∈I(Gi/Ni).
Corollary 1.7.7. Let G1, . . . , Gm be abelian groups, and for 1 ≤j ≤m, let Hj be a subgroup
of Gj. Then (G1 ⊕· · · ⊕Gn)/(H1 ⊕· · · ⊕Hn) ∼= (G1/H1) ⊕· · · ⊕(Gn/Hn).
Next, we study the structure of a ﬁnite abelian group. Results on elements of ﬁnite order are
presented in the next theorem and we recall the Chinese Remainder Theorem in a group theoretic
language. Their proof are routine and left as exercises.
Theorem 1.7.8. Let A be an abelian group and n ∈N. Then the following statements hold.
1. The mapping ϕn : A →A deﬁned by ϕn(a) = an is a group homomorphism.
2. An = {an : a ∈A} = im ϕn is a subgroup of A.
3. A(n) = {a ∈A : an = e} = ker ϕn is a subgroup of A.
4. τ(A) = {a ∈A : ∃k ∈N, ak = e} =
[
n∈N
A(n) is a subgroup of A. It is called the torsion
subgroup of A.
Theorem 1.7.9. [Chinese Remainder Theorem] Suppose m1, . . . , mk are pairwise relatively
prime (i.e., if i ̸= j, then gcd(mi, mj) = 1), and let n1, . . . , nk be any integers.
Then there
exists a unique integer v modulo m = m1 . . . mk such that
v ≡ni
mod mi
for all i = 1, . . . , k.

36
1. Groups
Remark. The Chinese remainder theorem may be restated as: if m1, . . . , mk are pairwise rela-
tively primes and m = m1 . . . mk, then
Zm ∼= Zm1 ⊕· · · ⊕Zmk.
Corollary 1.7.10. If m = pn1
1 . . . pnk
k where n1, . . . , nk ∈N and p1, . . . , pk are distinct primes, then
Zm ∼= Zpn1
1 ⊕· · · ⊕Zp

k .
We shall use the Chinese remainder theorem to prove our ﬁrst lemma.
Lemma 1.7.11. Let g ∈G be an element such that gm = 1 where m = m1 . . . mk and mi are
pairwise relatively prime. Then there exist unique elements g1, . . . , gk of G satisfying the following
conditions:
(a) gmi
i
= e for all i ∈{1, . . . , k}
(b) g1, . . . , gk commute pairwise and
(c) g = g1 . . . gk.
Proof. First we show existence, then uniqueness. The gi are in fact powers of g.
Existence:
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, choose v1, . . . , vk satisfying
vi ≡1
mod mi and vi ≡0
mod m/mi.
For each i, let vi = λi(m/mi) for some λi ∈Z and set gi = gvi. Then we have
(i) gmi
i
= gvimi = gλi(m/mi)mi = gλim and
(ii) g1, . . . , gk are powers of g and hence commute pairwise.
(iii) Note that v1 +· · ·+vk −1 ≡0 mod mi for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, that is, mi|(v1 +· · ·+vk −1). Since
m1, . . . , mk are pairwise relatively prime, v1 + · · · + vk ≡1 mod m1 . . . mk, so
g1 . . . gk = gv1 . . . gvk = gv1+···+vk = g.
Uniqueness:
Suppose g = g1 . . . gk where g = g1 . . . gk and g1, . . . , gk satisfy (i), (ii) and (iii).
Then for each i,
gvi = gvi
1 . . . gvi
k = gi,
that is, gi = gvi is the only possibility.
Example 1.7.1. Consider g ∈G with g60 = e. Then m = 3 · 4 · 5, so v1 = 45, v2 = 40 and v3 = 36.
Thus, g = g45g40g36 = g1g2g3.
In case g has order m = pa1
1 . . . pak
k
where mi = pai
i
and p1, . . . , pk are distinct primes, gi is
called the pi-primary part of g. We have the ﬁrst step of our decomposition.
Theorem 1.7.12. Let A be a ﬁnite abelian group of order m = m1 . . . mk where m1, . . . , mk
are pairwise relatively prime. For each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , k}, let Ai = {g ∈A : gmi = e}. Then
A1 × · · · × Ak ∼= A. Moreover, |Ai| = mi for all i.
Proof. Deﬁne φ : A1 × · · · × Ak →A by φ(g1, . . . , gk) = g1 . . . gk. Clearly, φ is a group homo-
morphism. By Lemma 1.7.11, φ is 1-1 and onto. Finally, m1 . . . mk = |A| = |A1 × · · · × Ak| =
|A1| . . . |Ak|. Let
m1 = pu11

1.7. Finite Abelian Groups
37
Here, the pij are distinct primes and uij ≥1. Since every element of Ai satisﬁes gmi = e, |Ai|
involves only those primes occuring in mi by Cauchy theorem. This forces |Ai| = mi for all i.
If m = pa1
1 . . . pak
k , then Ai in Theorem 1.7.12 is just the Sylow pi-subgroup of A. It now sufﬁces
to studied each factor Ai which is a Sylow pi-subgroup of A. To investigate them, we shall need
the following deﬁnition.
The positive integer n is an exponent for a group G if for each g ∈G, gn = 1. In this case, G
is said to have ﬁnite exponent and the least such n is called the exponent of G. For example, 12
is an exponent of Z6 but 6 is the exponent of Z6. We denote the exponent of a group G (if exists)
by exp G. Note that Z has no exponent and exp G divides |G|. The exponent of a ﬁnite abelian
p-group gives information on its structure as follows.
Theorem 1.7.13. Let A be an abelian group with |A| = pu where p is a prime. Suppose A has the
exponent p, (that is, ap = e for all a ∈A). Then
A ∼= Zp × · · · × Zp
|
{z
}
u copies
= (Zp)u.
Proof. Note that if a ∈A ∖{e}, ⟨a⟩∼= Zp. For any subset {a1, . . . , ak} ⊆A ∖{e}, we can deﬁne a
group homomorphism θ : ⟨a1⟩× · · · × ⟨ak⟩→A by
θ(ai1
1 , . . . , aik
k ) = ai1
1 . . . aik
k .
We shall say that a1, . . . , ak are “linearly independent” if θ is 1-1. This is equivalent to saying:
If θ(ai1
1 , . . . , aik
k ) = ai1
1 . . . aik
k = e, then i1 ≡. . . ≡ik ≡0 mod p.
Now there exists subsets of A ∖{e} for which θ is 1-1, e.g., the empty set, a singleton set.
Choose a subset {a1, . . . , ak} for which θ is 1-1 and k is as large as possible. We claim that in this
case
⟨a1⟩× · · · × ⟨ak⟩
θ→A
is onto, and hence is an isomorphism.
To see that θ is onto, let b ∈A. If b = e, clearly b ∈im θ. If b ̸= e, consider
⟨a1⟩× · · · × ⟨ak⟩× ⟨b⟩
¯θ→A.
By the maximal choice of {a1, . . . , ak}, ¯θ is not 1-1. Thus,
e = ¯θ(ai1
1 , . . . , aik
k , bj) = ai1
1 . . . aik
k bj
and j ̸≡0 mod p since θ is not 1-1. Hence, there is a λ such that jλ ≡1 mod p, so
e = aλi1
1
. . . aλik
k bjλ = aλi1
1
. . . aλik
k b
which implies b = a−λi1
1
. . . a−λik
k
∈im θ. Therefore, θ is onto as claimed, and we have an isomor-
phism
⟨a1⟩× · · · × ⟨ak⟩
θ
∼
=
/ A .
Thus, pk = |⟨a1⟩| . . . |⟨ak⟩| = |⟨a1⟩×· · ·×⟨ak⟩| = |A| = pu, so k = u and the theorem is proved.
Remark. If we write A in Theorem 1.7.13 additively, we see that it is just a vector space over the
ﬁeld Zp. Since A is ﬁnite, it is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over Zp. All we were doing in
Theorem 1.7.13 is ﬁnding a basis for A as a vector space over Zp.

1. Groups
Theorem 1.7.14. [Burnside Basis Theorem for Abelian p-groups] Suppose A is an abelian group
of exponent pk where p is a prime. Let Ap = {ap : a ∈A}. If H is a subgroup of A and HAp = A,
then H = A. Equivalently, if the cosets Apa1, . . . , Apak of A/Ap generate A/Ap, then a1, . . . , ak
generate A.
Proof. Observe that HAp = A implies HpAp2 = Ap, so
A = HAp = H(HpAp2) = HAp2.
Also, HAp2 = A implies HpAp3 = Ap, so
A = HAp = H(HpAp3) = HAp3.
Continue inductively, we have A = HApr for all r. But Apk = {e}, so A = HApk = H. This
completes the proof.
Theorem 1.7.15. Let A be a ﬁnite abelian group of exponent p where p is a prime, and let H be
a subgroup of A. Then there exists a subgroup K of A such that H ∩K = {e} and HK = A. In
other words, A is the internal direct product of H and K.
Proof. Let K be a subgroup of A satisfying H∩K = {e} and among all subgroups K of A satisfying
H ∩K = {e}, K is as large as possible. We claim that HK = A which proves the theorem.
For, suppose conversely that a ∈A and a /∈HK. Then H ∩⟨K, a⟩̸= {e} by the maximal
choice of K, so there is a nontrivial element
e ̸= h = kai ∈H ∩⟨K, a⟩where h ∈H ∈and k ∈K.
If p|i, ai = e and h = k ∈H ∩K = {e}, a contradiction. If p ∤i, there is a λ with aiλ = a (iλ ≡1
mod p) and then a = aiλ = (hk−1)λ ∈HK, a contradiction. Hence, HK = A as required.
Remark. As with Theorem 1.7.13, the above theorem can be regarded as a statement about
vector spaces over Zp as follows: If V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over Zp and U is a
subspace, then there is a subspace W such that V = U ⊕W.
We are now ready to prove the structure theorem for a ﬁnite abelian p-group.
Theorem 1.7.16. Let A be a ﬁnite abelian p-group. Then A is (isomorphic to) a direct product of
cyclic groups.
Proof. We use induction on |A|. If |A| = 1, the result is clear. Now suppose |A| = pu > 1.
We assume inductively that any p-group where order is less than pu is a direct product of cyclic
groups. Consider the group
Ap = {ap : a ∈A}.
Claim A ̸= Ap. For, suppose A = Ap. Then
A = Ap = Ap2 = · · · = Apu = {e}
since |A| = pu. As |A| > 1, we must have A ̸= Ap.
Thus, A > Ap, so |A| > |Ap| and by the inductive hypothesis, Ap is the (internal) direct
product of cyclic subgroup. But every element of Ap has the form ap. Hence, so do the generators
of these cyclic factors, so there exist a1, . . . , ak ∈A such that
Ap = ⟨ap
1⟩× · · · × ⟨ap
k⟩.

More precisely, the map (api1
1 , . . . , apik
k )
θ0
7−→api1
1
. . . apik
k
is an isomorphism.
Now let H = ⟨a1, . . . , ak⟩be the subgroup of A generated by a1, . . . , ak. We claim that it is the
(internal) direct product of the groups ⟨a1⟩, . . . , ⟨ak⟩, or that
⟨a1⟩× · · · × ⟨ak⟩
θ→H
(ai1
1 , . . . , aik
k ) 7→ai1
1 . . . aik
k
is an isomorphism. Since H = ⟨a1, . . . , ak⟩, θ is onto. To see that θ is 1-1, suppose
e = θ(ai1
1 , . . . , aik
k ) = ai1
1 . . . aik
k .
(1.7.1)
Then e = (ai1
1 . . . aik
k )p = api1
1
. . . apik
k , so
api1
1
= · · · = apik
k
= e
since the map θ0 above is 1-1. Consider the integers i1, . . . , ik. If p ∤it for some of these integers,
then apit
t
= e implies ap
t = e. For, (apit
t )λt = (aλtit
t
)p = ap
t , where λtit ≡1 mod |at|. Thus,
p | i1, . . . , ik, so i1 = pj1, . . . , ik = pjk. But then (1.7.1) becomes
e = θ(apj1
1 , . . . , apjk
k ) = apj1
1
. . . apjk
k ,
so apj1
1
= · · · = apjk
k
= e since θ0 is 1-1. Hence, θ is 1-1.

Next, let Ap = {a ∈A : ap = e}. Then Ap is a ﬁnite group of exponent p and contains H ∩Ap
as a subgroup. Therefore, H ∩Ap has a component in Ap by Theorem 1.7.15. More precisely,
there is a subgroup K of Ap such that
(a) (H ∩Ap) ∩K = {e}
and
(b) (H ∩Ap)K = Ap.
Note that since K is a group of exponent p, K is a direct product of copies of Zp by Theorem
1.7.13. Finally, we claim that
(I) H ∩K = {e}
and
(II) HK = A.
They implies that A is a direct product of H and K which are both direct products of cyclic groups.
(I) Suppose H ∩K ̸= {e}. Thus, there is some x ∈H ∩K with x ̸= e and xp = e. But then
x ∈Ap, so (H ∩Ap) ∩K = (H ∩K) ∩Ap ̸= {e}, contradicting (i) above.
(II) Suppose a ∈A. Then ap ∈Ap = ⟨ap
1⟩× · · · × ⟨ap
k⟩, so ap = api1

. . . apik
k
= (ai1
1 . . . aik
k )p = bp
where b = ai1
1 . . . aik
k ∈H = ⟨a1, . . . , ak⟩. Thus, b−1a ∈Ap = (H ∩Ap)K ⊆HK by (ii)
above. Hence, a = b(b−1a) ∈HK and A = HK as required.
This completes the proof.
In addition, the above decomposition is unique. Hence, we are able to count the number of
non-isomorphic abelian p-groups.

of the factors in a decomposition of a ﬁnite abelian p-group uniquely determine the group up to

Then we have

u1 + 2u2 + 2u3 + · · · + 2um = v1 + 2v2 + 2v3 + · · · + 2vm

u1 + 2u2 + 3u3 + · · · + (m −1)um−1+mum =

It is easy to see that the above equations force u1 = v1, u2 = v2, . . . , um = vm as required.
Theorem 1.7.18. Let p be any prime and n a positive integer. Then
{r1 ≤r2 ≤· · · ≤rk} ←→Zpr1 × Zpr2 × · · · × Zprk

Suppose A is a ﬁnite abelian group of order pa1
1 . . . pak

where p1, . . . , pk are distinct primes.
Let
Ai = {g ∈A : gpai
i = e}.
By Theorem 1.7.12, A ∼= A1 ×· · ·×Ak where |Ai| = pai
i . Since each Ai is a direct product of cyclic
group by Theorem 1.7.17, this yields the following theorem.
Theorem 1.7.19. A ﬁnite abelian group is (isomorphic to) a direct product of cyclic groups.
Corollary 1.7.20. If m is a square free integer, then every abelian group of order m is cyclic.
Proof. Assume that an abelian group A is of order m = p1 . . . pr where pi are distinct primes.
Then
A ∼= Zp1 × · · · × Zpr ∼= Zm
by Theorem 1.7.12 and the Chinese remainder theorem, respectively.
Let A ∼= A1 × · · · × Ak as above. It is clear that Ai is the unique largest pi-subgroup of A.
Moreover, if B is ﬁnite abelian, and B ∼= B1 × · · · × Bk where Bi is a pi-group, then
A ∼= B ⇔(A1 ∼= B1 ∧. . . ∧Ak ∼= Bk).
Recall that if m and n are relatively prime then Zm×Zn ∼= Zmn. It follows that if n = pu1

where p1, . . . , pk are distinct primes, then

(1.7.2)
This gives rise to a second way of writing a ﬁnite abelian group A as a direct product of cyclic
groups. Namely, let p1, . . . , pk be the primes dividing |A|, and let
A = A1 × · · · × Ak,
where Ai is the pi-primary part of A. Express each Ai as a direct product of cyclic factors and
assume that t is the largest number of factors occurring in any Ai. Write

The integers nj are completely determined by the decomposition of A into a direct of cyclic
pi-groups. Conversely, given that
A = Zn1 × Zn2 × · · · × Znt.
where n1 | n2, n2 | n3, . . . , nt−1 | nt, the decomposition of A into a direct product of cyclic pi-
groups is completely determined. Thus, we have:
Theorem 1.7.21. [Structure Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups] Let A be a ﬁnite abelian group.
Then there exist integers n1, . . . , nt > 1 such that n1 | n2, n2 | n3, . . . , nt−1 | nt and
A ∼= Zn1 × Zn2 × · · · × Znt,
where these integers are uniquely deﬁned by A. More precisely, if m1, . . . , ms are positive integers
greater than 1 such that m1 | m2, m2 | m3, . . . , ms−1 | ms, and
A ∼= Zn1 × Zn2 × · · · × Znt ∼= Zm1 × Zm2 × · · · × Zms,
then t = s, and n1 = m1, . . . , nt = mt.
Example 1.7.3. Find all non-isomorphic abelian groups of order:
1. 6
2. 12

Solution. By Example 1.7.2 and Theorem 1.7.21. We have the following answers.
6 = 2 · 3: Z2 × Z3 ∼= Z6,
12 = 22 · 3: Z2 × Z2 × Z3 ∼= Z2 × Z6 and Z22 × Z3 ∼= Z12,
27 = 33: Z3 × Z3 × Z3, Z3 × Z32 and Z33,
500 = 22 · 53: Z2 × Z2 × Z5 × Z5 × Z5 ∼= Z2 × Z10 × Z10, Z2 × Z2 × Z5 × Z52 ∼= Z10 × Z50,
Z2 × Z2 × Z53 ∼= Z2 × Z250, Z22 × Z5 × Z5 × Z5 ∼= Z5 × Z5 × Z20, Z22 × Z5 × Z52 ∼= Z5 × Z100 and
Z22 × Z53 ∼= Z500.
By Cauchy’s theorem, if p is a divisor of the order of a group G, then G has a subgroup of
order p. We also see that A4 is a group of order 12 but it has no subgroup of order six. Hence, it
may not hold that G will have a subgroup of order m when m is a divisor of |G|. However, if G is
an abelian group, we have our ﬁnal results.

1.7. Finite Abelian Groups
43
Corollary 1.7.22. Let A be a ﬁnite abelian group. If m divides the order of A, then A has a
subgroup of order m.
Proof. Write A = Zn1 × Zn2 × · · · × Znt as in the above theorem. Then |A| = n1n2 . . . nt. Since m
divides |A|, m = l1l2 . . . lt with li | ni for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , t}. Then (ni/li)Zni is a subgroup of Zni
of order li for all i. Thus,
(n1/l1)Zn1 × (n2/l2)Zn2 × · · · × (nt/lt)Znt
is a subgroup of A of order l1l2 . . . lt = m as desired.
Corollary 1.7.23. Let A be a ﬁnite abelian group. Then there exists g ∈A such that the order of g
is the exponent of A.
Proof. By Theorem 1.7.21, there exist positive integers n1, n2, . . . , nt ≥1 such that n1 | n2 | · · · | nt
and
A ∼= Zn1 × Zn2 × · · · × Znt.
Thus, exp A = nt and (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) in the rightmost group has order nt.
Remark. The above corollary is false if A is non-abelian. For example, the exponent of S3 is 6,
however S3 contains no elements of order 6.

Rings and Fields
Rings and ﬁelds are the most common algebraic structures for students. They have learned addi-
tion together with multiplication since elementary schools. The abstract treatments using groups
are presented in the ﬁrst section. Ideals and factorizations are discussed in details. Finally, we
talk about polynomials over a ring and which will be used in a construction of ﬁeld extensions.
2.1
Basic Concepts
2.1.1
Rings
A ring is a triple (R, +, ·) where
(R1) (R, +) is an abelian group,
(R2) (R, ·) is a semigroup, and
(R3) + and · satisfy the distributive laws, namely,
∀a, b, c ∈R, a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) and ∀a, b, c ∈R, (b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a).
The binary operations + and · are called the addition and the multiplication of the ring (R, +, ·),
respectively, 0, the identity of (R, +) is called the zero of R, for a, b ∈R, ab (juxtaposition) may
denote a · b and (R, +, ·) may be denoted by R. For a ∈R, −a is called the additive inverse of a
in R.
A ring R is said to be commutative if ∀a, b ∈R, ab = ba. If 1 is the identity of (R, ·), then 1 is
called the identity or unity of the ring R. If R contains an identity, i.e., (R, ·) is a multiplicative
monoid, then R is called a ring with identity.
Unless the contrary is explicitly stated “ring” will mean “ring with identity”.
A subset S of a ring R is a subring if S is a subgroup of the additive group and also a submonoid
of the multiplicative monoid of R. Clearly the intersection of any set of subrings of R is a subring.
Hence, if A is a subset of R, we may deﬁne the subring generated by A to be the intersection of
all subrings of R which contain A.
Examples 2.1.1 (Examples of rings).
1. Z, Q, R and C are commutative rings under usual ad-
dition and multiplication.
2. For n ∈N, (Zn, +, ·) is a commutative ring.
3. Recall that for a nonempty set X and P(X) the power set of X, we deﬁne A△B = (A ∖
B) ∪(B ∖A) for all subsets A and B of X. Then (P(X), △, ∩) is a commutative ring with
identity X.
4. If A is an abelian group, then End(A), the set of all homomorphisms on A, is a ring with
the addition and multiplication are given by
(f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)
and
(f · g)(a) = f(g(a))
for all f, g ∈End(A) and a ∈A. Its identity is the identity map.

2. Rings and Fields
5. If X is a topological space, then C(X), the set of all continuous functions from X to R, is a
commutative ring with pairwise operations. That is,
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
and
(f · g)(x) = f(x)g(x)
for all f, g ∈C(X) and x ∈X.
6. Let d be a square free integer. The set Z[
√
d] = {a + b
√
d : a, b ∈Z} is a subring of C.
A number of elementary properties of rings are consequences of the fact that a ring is an
abelian group relative to addition and a monoid relative to multiplication. For example, we have
−(a + b) = −a −b := (−a) + (−b) and if na is deﬁned for n ∈Z as before, then the rules for
multiples (or powers) in an abelian group,
n(a + b) = na + nb,
(n + m)a = na + ma,
and
(nm)a = n(ma)
hold. There are also a number of simple consequences of the distributive laws which we now
note. In the ﬁrst place, induction on m and n give the generalization

We note next that
a0 = 0a = 0
for all a ∈R; for we have a0 = a(0 + 0) = a0 + a0. Addition of −a0 gives a0 = 0. Similarly,
0a = 0. We have the equation
0 = 0b = (a + (−a))b = ab + (−a)b,
which shows that (−a)b = −ab. Similarly, a(−b) = −ab; consequently
(−a)(−b) = −a(−b) = −(−ab) = ab.
If a and b commute, that is, ab = ba, then ambn = bnam. Also, by induction we can prove the
binomial theorem
(a + b)n = an +

an−1b +

an−2b2 + · · · +

for all n ∈N.
Remark. In the case 1 = 0 in a ring R, we have that
ab = (a · 1)b = a(1 · b) = a(0 · b) = a · 0 = 0
for all a, b ∈R.
A ring with this property is called a zero ring.
If R and S are rings, so is R × S, with coordinatewise operations:
(r, s) + (r′, s′) = (r + r′, s + s′)
and
(r, s)(r′, s′) = (rr′, ss′).
Note that (1R, 1S) is the identity of R × S. More generally, if Rα is a family of rings, then Q
α Rα
is a ring with coordinatewise operations.
Let R be a ring. An element x ∈R is said to be invertible or a unit if there is a y ∈R such
that xy = yx = 1. In this case, y is called the inverse of x.

2.1. Basic Concepts
47
Remark. If x is invertible, its inverse is unique. The invertible elements of R form a group under
multiplication, called the group of units of R and denoted by U(R) or R×.
A ring D is a division ring or skew ﬁeld if every nonzero element of D is invertible. A
commutative division ring is called a ﬁeld.
Examples 2.1.2.
1. Q, R and C are ﬁelds. Z is not a ﬁeld.
2. By Example 1.2.1 (5), we have ∀n ∈N, Zn is a ﬁeld ⇔n is a prime.
Example 2.1.3. Let n ∈N, R a ring and Mn(R) the set of all n × n matrices over R. Then
(Mn(R), +, ·) is a ring under the usual addition and multiplication of matrices with unity In, the
identity matrix. If n > 1, then Mn(R) is not commutative. The group of invertible elements of
Mn(R) is called the general linear group and denoted by GLn(R). For the case R is commutative,
we can derive the determinant criterion for a matrix A to be invertible. We have the following
results.
Theorem 2.1.1. Let R be a commutative ring and A ∈Mn(R). Then
A(adj A) = (det A)In = (adj A)A.
In particular, A is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible in R.
A noteworthy special case of the theorem is the next corollary.
Corollary 2.1.2. If F is a ﬁeld, A ∈Mn(F) is invertible if and only if det A ̸= 0.
Some rings do not have the property that the product of two nonzero elements is always
nonzero. If so, it leads to the cancellation property in the rings. Let R be a ring and 0 ̸= a ∈R.
a is called a left [right] zero divisor if ∃b ∈R ∖{0}, ab = 0 [ba = 0], and it is called a zero
divisor if it is both a left and a right zero divisor. R is entire if it possesses no zero divisors. A
commutative entire ring is called an integral domain.
Examples 2.1.4.
1. Z is an integral domain which is not a ﬁeld.
2. Every ﬁeld is an integral domain.
3. C([0, 1]) is not an integral domain.
Remark. Let R be a ring. Then we have
R is entire ⇔∀a, b ∈R [ab = 0 ⇒(a = 0 or b = 0)] ⇔(R ∖{0}, ·) is a cancellative semigroup.
Theorem 1.2.2 implies an important result on ﬁniteness of an integral domain.
Theorem 2.1.3. Every ﬁnite integral domain is a ﬁeld.
Proof. Let D be a ﬁnite integral domain. Then (D ∖{0}, ·) is a ﬁnite cancellative semigroup. By
Theorem 1.2.2, (D ∖{0}, ·) is a group. Hence, if a ∈D and a ̸= 0, then a has an inverse under ·.
Since D is commutative, D is a ﬁeld.

2.1.2
Quaternions
In 1843, W. R. Hamilton constructed the ﬁrst example of a division ring in which the commutative
law of multiplication does not hold. This was an extension of the ﬁeld of complex numbers,
whose elements were quadruples of real numbers (α, β, γ, δ) for which the usual addition and a
multiplication were deﬁned so that 1 = (1, 0, 0, 0) is the unit and i = (0, 1, 0, 0), j = (0, 0, 1, 0),
and k = (0, 0, 0, 1) satisfy i2 = j2 = k2 = −1 = ijk. Hamilton called his quadruples, quaternions.
Previously, he had deﬁned complex numbers as pairs of real numbers (α, β) with the product
(α, β)(γ, δ) = (αγ −βδ, αδ + βγ). Hamilton’s discovery of quaternions led to a good deal of
experimentation with other such “hypercomplex” number systems and eventually to a structure
theory whose goal was to classify such systems. A good deal of important algebra thus evolved
from the discovery of quaternions.
We shall not follow Hamilton’s way of introducing quaternions. Instead we shall deﬁne this
system as a certain subring of the ring M2(C) of 2×2 matrices with complex number entries. This
will have the advantage of reducing the calculations to a single simple veriﬁcation.
We consider the subset H of the ring M2(C) of complex 2 × 2 matrices that have the form
x =
 a
b
−¯b
¯a

=
 α0 + α1
√−1
α2 + α3
√−1
−α2 + α3


,
αi real.
(2.1.1)
We claim that H is a subring of M2(C). Since a1 −a2 = ¯a1 −¯a2 for complex numbers, it is
clear that H is closed under subtraction; hence H is a subgroup of the additive group of M2(C).
We obtain the unit matrix by taking a = 1, b = 0 in (2.1.1). Hence, 1 ∈H. Since
 a

=
 ac −b ¯d
ad + b¯c

and a1a2 = ¯a1¯a2, the right-hand side has the form
 u
v
−¯v
¯u

where u = ac −b ¯d, v = ad + b¯c. Therefore, H is closed under multiplication and so H is a subring
of M2(C).
We now show that H is a division ring. We note ﬁrst that
∆:= det

√−1
−α2 + α3
√−1
α0 −α1
√−1


0 + α2
1 + α2
2 + α2
3.
Since the αi are real numbers, this is real, and is 0 only if every αi = 0, that is, if the matrix
is 0. Hence, every non-zero element of H has an inverse in M2(C). Moreover, we have, by the
deﬁnition of the adjoint, that
adj
 a
b
−¯b
¯a


.
Since ¯¯a = a, this is obtained from the x in (2.1.1) by replacing a by ¯a and b by −b, and so it is
contained in H. Thus, if the matrix x is ̸= 0 then its inverse is
¯a∆−1

and this is contained in H. Hence, H is a division ring.

We verify that

so αl = βl, 0 ≤l ≤3. Thus, any x in H can be written in one and only one way in the from
(2.1.2). The product of two elements in H
(α0 + α1i + α2j + α3k)(β0 + β1i + β2j + β3k)
is determined by the product and sum in R, the distributive laws and the multiplication table
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1
ij = −ji = k, jk = −kj = i, ki = −ik = j.
Incidentally, because these show that H is not commutative we have constructed an inﬁnite divi-
sion ring that is not a ﬁeld. The ring H is called the division ring of real quaternions. Recall
that Q8 = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} is called the quaternion group (see Porject 1).
Algebra is not as rich in division ring as it is in ﬁelds. For example, there are no ﬁnite division
rings. This is the content of a famous theorem of Wedderburn. Its proof can be found in Section
5.7.
Theorem 2.1.4. [Wedderburn, 1909] A ﬁnite division ring is a ﬁeld.
2.1.3
Characteristic
Let R be a ring. If there is a smallest positive integer n such that na = 0 for all a ∈R, then R
is said to have characteristic n. If no such n exists, R is said to have characteristic zero. We
denote the characteristic of R by char R. The characteristic of a ring gives some information on
its additive group structure.
Remark. It is easy to see that char R = n if and only if n is the smallest positive integer such that
n1R = 0.
Example 2.1.5. The rings Z, Q, R, C and H are of characteristic zero, char Zn = n and
char(Zm × Zn) = lcm(m, n).
Theorem 2.1.5. [Characteristic of an Integral Domain] If R is an integral domain, then R is of
characteristic zero or a prime p. In particular, every ﬁeld is of characteristic zero or a prime p.
Proof. Let R be an integral domain of characteristic n > 0. Assume that n = ab for some a, b ∈N.
It follows that 0 = n1R = (ab)1R = (a1R)(b1R). Since R has no zero divisor, a1R = 0 or b1R = 0.
Then a = n or b = n. Hence, n is a prime.
Theorem 2.1.6. Let R be a ring of characteristic a prime p and a, b ∈R. If a and b commute, then
(a + b)p = ap + bp
and
(a + b)pk = apk + bpk
for all k ∈N.

and the proof is complete.
2.1.4
Ring Homomorphisms and Group Rings
Like in groups, a ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves both addition
and multiplication. Let R and S be rings. A map ϕ : R →S is called a homomorphism if
ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)
and
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b)
for all a, b ∈R. The deﬁnitions of monomorphisms, epimorphisms, endomorphisms, isomor-
phisms and automorphisms of rings are given as in groups.
Remarks. Let ϕ : R →S be a ring homomorphism.
1. ϕ : (R, +) →(S, +) is an additive group homomorphism.
2. ϕ(1R) may not be the identity of S.
3. If ϕ(1R) = 0, then ϕ(x) = 0 for all x ∈R.
4. If R has an identity and ϕ is onto, then ϕ(1R) is the identity of S.
Proof. Let s ∈S. Since ϕ is onto, ∃x ∈R, ϕ(x) = s. Then sϕ(1R) = ϕ(x)ϕ(1R) = ϕ(x1R) = ϕ(x) =
s. Similarly, ϕ(1R)s = s. Hence, ϕ(1R) is the identity of S.
Examples 2.1.6.
1. If ϕ : Z →Z is a ring homomorphism, then ϕ is the zero or the identity
map.
2. If ϕ : Q →Q is a ring homomorphism, then ϕ is the zero or the identity map.
3. If ϕ : R →R is a ring homomorphism, then ϕ is the zero or the identity map.
4. If p is a prime and ϕ : Zp →Zp is a ring homomorphism, then ϕ is the zero or the identity
map.
Proof. (1) Observe that ϕ(1) = ϕ(1 · 1) = ϕ(1)ϕ(1), so ϕ(1) = 0 or ϕ(1) = 1. Moreover, ϕ(n) =
nϕ(1) for all n ∈Z. Thus, ϕ(n) = 0 for all n ∈Z or ϕ(n) = n for all n ∈Z as desired.
(2) Similar to Z, ϕ(1) = 0 or ϕ(1) = 1 and ϕ(n) = nϕ(1) for all n ∈Z. For m ∈Z and n ∈N,
we have ϕ(m(1/n)) = mϕ(1/n) and ϕ(1) = ϕ(n(1/n)) = nϕ(n). If ϕ(1) = 0, then ϕ(1/n) = 0 for
all n ∈N, so ϕ is the zero map. On the other hand, if ϕ(1) = 1, then ϕ(1/n) = 1/n for all n ∈N
which implies ϕ(m/n) = m/n for all m ∈Z and n ∈N.
(3) Assume that ϕ(x) is not the zero map. We can show that ϕ(x) = x for all x ∈Q. Moreover, for
x ∈R+, ϕ(x) = ϕ((√x)2) = (ϕ(√x))2 > 0. This implies ∀a, b ∈R, a < b ⇒ϕ(a) < ϕ(b). Now, let
x ∈R. Suppose that ϕ(x) ̸= x. Then ϕ(x) < x or x < ϕ(x). By the density theorem, ∃q1, q2 ∈Q
such that ϕ(x) < q1 < x or x < q2 < ϕ(x). Thus, ϕ(x) < q1 < ϕ(x) or ϕ(x) < q2 < ϕ(x) yields a
contradiction. Hence, ϕ(x) = x for all x ∈R.
(4) is proved in the next section.
Let G = {gi : i ∈I} be any multiplicative group, and let R be any commutative ring. Let RG
be the set of all formal sums

Observe that (ai +bi) = 0 except for a ﬁnite number of indices i, so the above sum is again in RG.
It is immediate that (RG, +) is an abelian group with additive identity P
i∈I 0gi.
Multiplication of two elements of RG is deﬁned by the use of the multiplications in G and R
as follows:

Naively, we formally distribute the sum P
i∈I aigi over the sum P
i∈I bigi and rename a term
ajgjbkgk by ajbkgk where gjgk = gi in G. Since ai and bi are 0 for all but a ﬁnite number of i,
the sum P
gjgk=gi ajbk contains only a ﬁnite number of nonzero summands ajbk ∈R and may
thus be viewed as an element of R. Again at most a ﬁnite number of such sums P
gjgk=gi ajbk are
nonzero. Thus, multiplication is closed on RG. We can proceed to show that
Theorem 2.1.7. [Group Ring] If G is a multiplicative group and R is a commutative ring, then
(RG, +, ·) is a ring with unity 1R e.
If we rename the element P
i∈I aigi of RG, where ai = 0 for i ̸= j and aj = 1, by gj, we
see that (RG, ·) can be considered to contain G naturally. Thus, if G is not abelian, RG is not
commutative. Clearly, char RG = char R, for any group G. The ring RG deﬁned above is the
group ring of G over R. If F is a ﬁeld, then FG is the group algebra of G over F.

2.2
Ideals, Quotient Rings and the Field of Fractions
Ideals play an important role in ring theory. They are used to construct quotient rings like normal
subgroups.
Let R be a ring. A subset I of R is called a left [right] ideal of R if
1. I is a subgroup of (R, +)
and
2. ∀r ∈R∀a ∈I, ra ∈I [ar ∈I].
It is called a two-sided ideal or an ideal of R if I is both a left and a right ideal.
E.g., {0} and R are two-sided ideals of R.
Theorem 2.2.1. Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism of rings. Then the kernel of ϕ given by
ker ϕ = {x ∈R : ϕ(x) = 0S}
is an ideal of R.
Proof. It is immediate that ker ϕ is a subgroup of (R, +). If a ∈R and x ∈ker ϕ, then ϕ(ax) =
ϕ(a)ϕ(x) = ϕ(a)0 = 0 and ϕ(xa) = ϕ(x)ϕ(a) = 0ϕ(a) = 0. Hence, ax and xa are in ker ϕ.
Remark. Similar to a group homomorphism, for a ring homomorphism, we have ϕ is one-to-one
if and only if ker ϕ = {0}.
For subsets X and Y of R, let XY denote the set of all ﬁnite sums in the form
n
X
i=1
xiyi,
where xi ∈X, yi ∈Y and n ∈N.
For a ∈R, we have Ra = {ra : r ∈R} and aR = {ar : r ∈R}.
Examples 2.2.1.
1. All distinct ideals of Zn are dZn, where d = 0 or (d ∈N and d | n).
2. All distinct ideals of Z are mZ, where m ∈N ∪{0}.
Remarks. Let R be a ring.
1. If I is an ideal of R, then IR = I = RI.
2. If a left [right, two-sided] ideal I of R contains a unit, then I = R.
3. If R is a division ring, then {0} and R are the only left [right, two-sided] ideals of R.

2.2. Ideals, Quotient Rings and the Field of Fractions
53
4. An arbitrary intersection of left [right, two-sided] ideals of R is a left [right, two-sided]
ideal of R.
5. If S is a subring of R and I is an ideal of R, then S + I is a subring of R, I is an ideal of
S + I and S ∩I is an ideal of S.
6. If I and J are left [right, two-sided] ideals of R, then I +J and IJ are left [right, two-sided]
ideals of R.
Example 2.2.2. Let R be a ring and S =

0

is a right ideal of S.
They are not ideals of S.
Let R be a ring. If X ⊂R, then the ideal of R generated by X is the intersection of all
ideals containing X and it is denoted by (X), so (X) is the smallest ideal of R containing X. For
a1, . . . , an ∈R, let (a1, . . . , an) denote ({a1, . . . , an}). An ideal I of R is called a principal ideal if
I = (a) for some a ∈R. Observe that for a ∈R,
(a) =
( m
X
i=1
riasi : ri, si ∈R and m ∈N
)
.
If R is a commutative ring, then ∀a ∈R, (a) = aR = Ra.
A ring R is a principal ideal ring if every ideal of R is principal. A principal ideal domain
(PID) is a principal ideal ring which is an integral domain. Hence, an integral domain R is a PID
if {Ra : a ∈R} is the set of all ideals of R.
Examples 2.2.3.
1. Zn is a principal ideal ring.
2. Z is a PID.
3. Every ﬁeld has only two ideals, namely (0) and (1) = F, so it is a PID.
Remark. Let F be a ﬁeld, R a ring and ϕ : F →R a ring homomorphism. Then ker ϕ is either
{0} or F which implies ϕ is 1-1 or is the zero map, respectively. Hence, every nonzero ring
homomorphism of ﬁelds must be 1-1. In particular, one can readily verify that the only ring
endomorphisms of Zp are the zero map and the identity map. This ﬁnishes the proof of Example
2.1.6.
Theorem 2.2.2. Let R be a commutative ring whose only ideals are {0} and R itself. Then R is a
ﬁeld.
Proof. Let a ∈R ∖{0}. Then (a) = R, so 1 ∈(a). Since R is commutative, there is a b ∈R such
that ab = 1 = ba.
Suppose I is an ideal of R. Then I is a subgroup of R, considered as an abelian group, and so
we can form the abelian group R/I. The elements of R/I are cosets
r + I = {r + a : a ∈I}.
The addition in R/I is given by (r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I.
Now let us deﬁne a multiplication on R/I, namely
(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I.
Note that if r + I = r′ + I and s + I = s′ + I, then r −r′ and s −s′ are in I, so
rs −r′s′ = (r −r′)s + r′(s −s′) ∈I.
Thus, the above multiplication is well deﬁned, it is easy to see that R/I is a ring. Hence, we have
the next theorem.

54
2. Rings and Fields
Theorem 2.2.3. [Quotient Ring] Let R be a ring and I an ideal of R. Then the operators
(r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I
and
(r + I)(s + I) = rs + I
make R/I into a ring with unity 1 + I, called the factor or quotient ring of R by I. The map
ϕ : R →R/I deﬁned by ϕ(r) = r + I is an onto ring homomorphism which has kernel I. It is
called the canonical projection of R onto R/I.
There also are three isomorphism theorems for rings. Their proofs are similar to isomorphism
theorems for groups. Hence, we shall just sketch them.
Theorem 2.2.4. [First Isomorphism Theorem] If ϕ : R →S is an onto ring homomorphism, then
R/ ker ϕ ∼= im S.
Proof. Deﬁne ¯ϕ : R/ ker ϕ →S by ¯ϕ(r + ker ϕ)ϕ(r) for all r ∈R. Clearly, ¯ϕ is onto and it is easy
to check that ¯ϕ is a ring homomorphism. Moreover, for r, s ∈R, we have
ϕ(r) = ϕ(s) ⇔ϕ(r −s) = 0 ⇔r −s ∈ker ϕ ⇔r + ker ϕ = s + ker ϕ.
Hence, ¯ϕ is an isomorphism.
Theorem 2.2.5. [Second Isomorphism Theorem] If S is a subring and I is an ideal of R, then
S/(S ∩I) ∼= (S + I)/I.
Proof. Deﬁne ϕ : S →(S + I)/I by ϕ(s) = s + I for all s ∈S. It is easy to verify that ϕ is
a ring homomorphism with kernel S ∩I and the theorem follows from the ﬁrst isomorphism
theorem.
Theorem 2.2.6. [Third Isomorphism Theorem] If I and J are ideals of a ring R such that I ⊆J,
then J/I is an ideal of R/I and
(R/I)/(J/I) ∼= R/J.
Proof. Deﬁne ϕ : R/I →R/J by ϕ(r + I) = r + J for all r ∈R. It can be veriﬁed that ϕ is a ring
homomorphism with kernel J/I and the theorem follows from the ﬁrst isomorphism theorem.
Remark. As for groups, the third isomorphism theorem gives a 1-1 correspondence between the
set of ideals of R containing I and the set of ideals of R/I.
We end this section by embedding an integral domain into a ﬁeld. We say that a ring R can
be embedded in a ring R′ if there exists a monomorphism (i.e., an injective homomorphism) of
R into R′.
Example 2.2.4. A ring R can be embedded in the ring Mn(R) by the diagonal map a 7→aIn.
Theorem 2.2.7. Any ring R without identity can be embedded in a ring R′ with identity. Moreover,
R′ can be chosen to be either of characteristic zero or of same characteristic as R.
Proof. Consider the rings R × Z and R × Zn deﬁned in Exercises 2.1. They are rings with unity
(0, 1) and (0, ¯1), and of characteristic 0 and n, respectively. If char R = 0, we deﬁne ϕ : R →R×Z
by ϕ(x) = (x, 0) and if char R = n, we deﬁne ϕ : R →R × Zn by ϕ(x) = (x, ¯0). It is easy to show
that both functions are monomorphisms. This ﬁnishes the proof.

2.2. Ideals, Quotient Rings and the Field of Fractions
55
We now wish to show that every integral domain can be embedded in a ﬁeld, called its ﬁeld
of fractions such that every element of the ﬁeld is a fraction a/b where a and b lie in the integral
domain and b ̸= 0. There is only one problem to overcome: we might wish to deﬁne the ﬁeld
to be the set of all “fraction” a/b, with b ̸= 0. But this is not quite right because two different
fractions may be the same number. E.g., 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6. We overcome this problem by deﬁning
an equivalence relation on certain pairs of elements in the integral domain.
The results are
presented in the next theorem. Its proof is routine and omitted.
Theorem 2.2.8. [Field of Fractions] Suppose D is an integral domain, and let S be the set of
pairs
{(r, s) : r, s ∈D and s ̸= 0}.
1. (r, s) ∼(r′, s′) ⇔rs′ = r′s
deﬁnes an equivalence relation on S.
2. Let [r, s] denote the equivalence class of (r, s) and let Q(D) denote the set of all equivalence
classes. Then
[r, s] + [r′, s′] = [rs′ + r′s, ss′]
and
[r, s][r′, s′] = [rr′, ss′]
are well deﬁned binary operations on Q(D).
3. The set Q(D) is a ﬁeld with these operations and D is embedded in Q(D) by the monomor-
phism r 7→[r, 1]. The ﬁeld Q(D) is called the ﬁeld of fractions or quotient ﬁeld of D. The
equivalence class [r, s] is denoted by r/s.
Remark. If R is an entire ring which is not commutative, the construction Q(R) above does not
exist in general.
Example 2.2.5. Let D be an integral domain and a, b ∈D. If am = bm and an = bn, for m and n
relatively prime positive integers, prove that a = b.
Proof. If a = 0, then b = 0 since D has no zero divisor. Assume that a ̸= 0. Then b ̸= 0. Let F be
the ﬁeld of fractions of D. Since (m, n) = 1, ∃x, y ∈Z, mx + ny = 1. Thus, in F, we have
a = a1 = amx+ny = (am)x(an)y = (bm)x(bn)y = bmx+ny = b1 = b,
so a = b in D.
Exercises 2.2.
1. An element a of a ring R is nilpotent if an = 0 for some n ∈N. Show that the set of
all nilpotent elements N in a commutative ring R is an ideal, called the nilradical of R. Moreover,
prove that R/N has no nonzero nilpotent.
2. Show that a ring R has no nonzero nilpotent element if and only if 0 is the only solution of x2 = 0

3. Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphisms of rings. Prove the following statements.
(a) If I is an ideal of R and ϕ is onto, then ϕ(I) is an ideal of S.
(b) If J is an ideal of S, then ϕ−1(J) is an ideal of R containing ker ϕ.
4. Let R be a commutative ring and I an ideal of R. Show that

(b) if

I = R, then I = R.
5. Let R and S be rings and ϕ : R →S be such that
(i) ∀r, s ∈R, ϕ(r + s) = ϕ(r) + ϕ(s) and
(ii) ∀r, s ∈R [ϕ(rs) = ϕ(r)ϕ(s) ∨ϕ(rs) = ϕ(s)ϕ(r)].
Prove that ∀r, s ∈R, ϕ(rs) = ϕ(r)ϕ(s) or ∀r, s ∈R, ϕ(rs) = ϕ(s)ϕ(r).

R/(I ∩J) ∼= R/I × R/J.

(b) every ideal of Mn(R) is of the form Mn(I) for some ideal I of R. In particular, if R is a division
ring, then the ring Mn(R) has only two ideals.

(b) Determine all units, zero divisors and nilpotent elements in Zn.
(c) Determine all units, zero divisors and nilpotent elements in Zn[i].
2.3
Maximal Ideals and Prime Ideals
We have learned that a ring R has two trivial ideals, namely {0} and R itself. In this section, we
shall discover properties of maximal ideals and prime ideals. These are two kinds of important
ideals in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
An ideal M of R is maximal if M ̸= R and for every ideal J of R,
M ⊆J ⊆R ⇒J = M or J = R.
Example 2.3.1. In the ring Z, for n ∈N, nZ is maximal if and only if n is a prime.
Proof. Let n be a prime and let J be an ideal of Z such that nZ ⊆J ⊆Z. Then J = dZ for some
d ∈N and d | n, so d = 1 or d = n. Hence, J = nZ or J = Z. On the other hand, assume
that n = ab for some 1 < a, b < n. Then nZ ⊆aZ ⊆Z, aZ ̸= nZ and aZ ̸= Z, so nZ is not
maximal.
Remarks.
1. Every ideal I ̸= R is contained in some maximal ideal M.
Proof. Let I = {J : J ̸= R and J is an ideal of R containing I}. Let C = {Jα}α∈Λ be a chain in I .
Then ∪C is an ideal of R. If ∪C = R, then 1 ∈Jα for some α ∈Λ, so Jα = R, a contradiction.
Hence, ∪C is an upper bound of C in I . By, Zorn’s lemma, we have I has a maximal element
which turns out to be our desired maximal ideal containing I.
2. If M is a maximal ideal and I is an ideal of R such that I ⊈M, then M + I = R.
Proof. Let x ∈I, /∈M. Consider the ideal J = M + Rx which is larger than M. Since M is maximal,
J = R. Thus, R = M + Rx ⊆M + I.
3. If M1 and M2 are distinct maximal ideals, then M1 + M2 = R. In addition, if R is commu-
tative, then M1M2 = M1 ∩M2.
4. If R is commutative, then Ru = R if and only if u is a unit.
Theorem 2.3.1. Let R be a commutative ring and M an ideal of R.
Then M is a maximal ideal of R if and only if R/M is a ﬁeld.
Proof. Clearly, R/M is a commutative ring with unity 1 + M. Assume that M is a maximal ideal.
Let a /∈M. Then M + Ra = R, so ∃b ∈R, 1 = m + ba. Thus, 1 + M = ba + M = (b + M)(a + M),
and hence R/M is a ﬁeld. Conversely, suppose that R/M is a ﬁeld. Let M ⊆J ⊆R and J ̸= M.
Then ∃a ∈J ∖M. Since R/M is a ﬁeld and a /∈M, ∃b ∈R, 1 + M = (a + M)(b + M) = ab + M,
so 1 −ab ∈M ⊆J. Since a ∈J, ab ∈J which implies 1 ∈J. Hence, J = R.

2.3. Maximal Ideals and Prime Ideals
57
An ideal P of R is prime of R if P ̸= R and for any ideals A, B of R,
AB ⊆P ⇒A ⊆P or B ⊆P.
Theorem 2.3.2. Let P be an ideal of R such that P ̸= R.
1. If ∀a, b ∈R, ab ∈P ⇒a ∈P or b ∈P, then P is prime.
2. If R is commutative and P is prime, then ∀a, b ∈R, ab ∈P ⇒a ∈P or b ∈P.
Proof. (1) Assume that AB ⊆P and A ⊈P. Choose a ∈A, /∈P. Let b ∈B. Thus, ab ∈AB ⊆P,
so a ∈P or b ∈P. But a /∈P, hence B ⊆P.
(2) Let a, b ∈R be such that ab ∈P. Since R is commutative, Rab = RaRb ⊆P, so Ra ⊆P or
Rb ⊆P. Hence, a ∈P or b ∈P.
Theorem 2.3.3. Let R be a commutative ring and P an ideal of R.
Then P is a prime ideal of R if and only if R/P is an integral domain.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 2.3.2 as follows. For an ideal P,
P is prime ⇔∀a, b ∈R, ab ∈P ⇒a ∈P or b ∈P
⇔∀a, b ∈R, (a + P)(b + P) = 0 + P ⇒a + P = 0 + P or b + P = 0 + P
⇔R/P is an integral domain
as desired.
Theorems 2.3.1 and 2.3.3 are the most useful for characterizing maximal ideals and prime
ideals in commutative rings.
Corollary 2.3.4. Let R be a commutative ring.
1. Every maximal ideal of R is prime.
2. If R is ﬁnite, then every prime ideal of R is maximal.
Example 2.3.2. In Z, nZ is prime if and only if n = 0 or n is a prime.
Remark. In the ring Z, {0} is a prime ideal which is not maximal.
The set of all prime ideals of a commutative ring R is denoted by Spec R, called the spectrum
of R. E.g., Spec Z = {pZ : p is a prime} ∪{{0}}. A local ring is a commutative ring which has a
unique maximal ideal.
Examples 2.3.3.
1. Z has inﬁnitely many maximal ideals of the form pZ where p is a prime,
so it is not a local ring.
2. Every ﬁeld is a local ring with maximal ideal {0}.
3. Zpn is a local ring with the maximal ideal pZpn for all primes p and n ∈N.
Theorem 2.3.5. Let R be a commutative ring.
Then R is a local ring if and only if the nonunits of R form an ideal.
Proof. Assume R is a local ring with the maximal ideal M. Let a ∈R ∖M. If aR ̸= R, then aR is
contained in some maximal ideal, so aR ⊆M which yields a contradiction. Thus, aR = R, so a
is a unit. Hence, M is the set of nonunits of R. Conversely, suppose that the nonunits of R form
an ideal M of R. Clearly, M is maximal. Let M′ be another maximal ideal of R. If ∃a ∈M′ ∖M,
then a is a unit, so M′ = R, a contradiction. Thus, M′ ⊆M. Since M′ is maximal, M′ = M.

2. Rings and Fields
Corollary 2.3.6. In a ﬁnite local ring R, every element is either a unit or a nilpotent element.
Example 2.3.4. Fix a prime p and let
Zp = {m/n : m, n ∈Z and p does not divide n}.
Then Zp is a subring of Q and is local. Its unique maximal ideal is {pk/n : k, n ∈Z and p ∤n}.
We shall show an important structure theorem for ﬁnite commutative rings in Section 4.6.
It says that every ﬁnite commutative ring is a direct product of a ﬁnite number of local rings.
(Corollary 4.6.7). Hence, a local ring turns out to be a core when we study a ﬁnite commutative
ring. It has many applications coding theory and cryptography.
Exercises 2.3.
1. Let R be a ring and I an ideal of R. Prove that the map J 7→J/I gives a 1-1
correspondence
{ideals of R containing I} ←→{ideals of R/I}.
Moreover, this correspondence carries maximal ideals to maximal ideals.
2. Prove Corollary 2.3.6 and Example 2.3.4.

4. Let R be a commutative ring. If every ideal proper of R is prime, show that R is a ﬁeld.
5. Show that in a Boolean ring R, every prime ideal P ̸= R is maximal.
6. Let R be a commutative ring and b ∈R a nilpotent element. Prove that u + b is a unit for all units u
in R.
Project 11 (Chain ring). A ring is called a chain ring if all its ideals form a chain under inclusion. For
example, Zpn, p a prime and n ∈N, is a chain ring. Also, every ﬁeld is a chain ring. Let R be a ﬁnite
commutative ring. Prove that R is a chain ring if and only if R is a local ring whose maximal ideal is
principal.
A ﬁnite chain ring arises in algebraic number theory as quotient rings of rings of integers in number
ﬁelds. It has many applications in coding theory because of the similarity with ﬁnite ﬁelds. Galois rings in
Project 16 are examples for this situation.
2.4
Factorizations
From elementary number theory, we know that every positive integer can be decomposed uniquely
into a product of prime numbers (Theorem 1.1.5). It is the unique factorization property of the
ring Z. In this section, we shall learn about factorizations in any other integral domains.
2.4.1
Irreducible Elements and Prime Elements
Let R be a commutative ring and suppose that a, b ∈R. We say that a divides b and write a | b, if
there is an r ∈R such that ra = b. This deﬁnition coincides the divisibility discussed previously
in Section 1.1.
Remarks. Let R be a commutative ring and a, b ∈R.
1. a divides b ⇔b ∈Ra ⇔Rb ⊆Ra.
2. a divides 0 (R0 ⊆Ra).
3. a ∈R, 1 divides a (Ra ⊆R · 1 = R).
4. a divides 1 ⇔R = Ra ⇔a is a unit.
5. 0 divides a ⇔Ra ⊆R0 ⇔a = 0.

2.4. Factorizations
59
Let R be an integral domain and suppose a, b ∈R. We say that a and b are associates if a | b
and b | a.
Theorem 2.4.1. Let R be an integral domain, a, b ∈R. The following statements are equivalent.
(i) a and b are associates.
(ii) Ra = Rb.
(iii) a = ub for some unit u ∈R.
Proof. (i) ⇒(iii) If a = 0, then b = 0 and (3) is clear. Suppose then that a ̸= 0. Since a | b and
b | a, we can write a = ub and b = va. Thus, a = ub = uva, so (uv −1)a = 0, so uv = 1. Hence,
a = ub and u is a unit of R.
(iii) ⇒(ii) If a = ub where u is a unit, then Ra = Rub = (Ru)b = Rb.
(ii) ⇒(i) If Ra = Rb, then a = rb, b = sa, so b | a and a | b. Hence, a and b are associates.
Let R be an integral domain. We say that a nonzero nonunit element a in R is an irreducible
element or atom if a cannot be expressed as a product a = bc where b and c are nonunits. For
example, in Z, p and −p, p a prime number, are irreducible elements.
Theorem 2.4.2. Let R be an integral domain and a a nonzero nonunit in R.
1. a is irreducible ⇔(∀b, c ∈R, a = bc ⇒b or c is a unit).
2. If Ra is maximal, then a is irreducible. The converse holds if R is a PID.
Proof. (1) It follows directly from the deﬁnition.
(2) Assume that Ra is maximal. Let b, c ∈R be such that a = bc. Then Ra ⊆Rb ⊆R. Since Ra
is maximal, Ra = Rb or Rb = R. If Rb = R, then b is a unit. Let Ra = Rb. Then a = bu for some
unit u ∈R, so bc = bu which implies c = u is a unit since R has no zero divisor.
Finally, we assume that R is a PID and a ∈R is irreducible. Let J be an ideal of R such that
Ra ⊆J ⊆R. Since R is a PID, J = Rb for some b in R, and so a ∈Rb. Thus, a = cb for some
c ∈R, so b or c is a unit. Hence, Rb = R or Ra = Rb.
A nonzero nonunit element p in R is a prime element if
∀a, b ∈R, p | ab ⇒p | a or p | b.
Note that a prime number is a prime element in Z by Corollary 1.1.4 (2).
Theorem 2.4.3. Let R be an integral domain.
(1) For a nonzero nonunit p in R, p is prime ⇔Rp is a prime ideal.
(2) Every prime element is irreducible. The converse holds if R is a PID.
Proof. (1) It follows directly from the deﬁnition and Theorem 2.3.2.
(2) Let p be a prime element. Assume that p = ab for some a, b ∈R. Then Rab = Rp, so Ra ⊆Rp
or Rb ⊆Rp. Since Rp = Rab ⊆(Ra ∩Rb), Ra = Rp or Rb = Rp, so au = p or bv = p for some
units u and v in R. Hence, b = u or a = v is a unit in R. Finally, suppose that R is a PID and p is
irreducible. Then Rp is maximal, so it is a prime ideal. Hence, p is prime.
2.4.2
Unique Factorization Domains
A unique factorization domain (UFD) is an integral domain R which satisﬁes:
1. Every nonzero nonunit of R is a product of atoms.
2. If a is a nonzero nonunit of R, then the expression of a as a product of atoms is unique in
the following sense: “If a = a1 . . . ar = b1 . . . bs where a1, . . . , ar, b1, . . . , bs are atoms, then
r = s and there is a reordering bi1, . . . , bir of b1, . . . , bs such that a1 and bi1 are associates, a2
and bi2 are associates, . . . , ar and bir are associates”.

60
2. Rings and Fields
Examples 2.4.1.
1. The ring of rational integers Z is a UFD by the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic (Theorem 1.1.5). Since U(Z) = {±1}, the atoms of Z are ±p where p is a prime.
Note that p and −p are associates (e.g., 12 = 2 · 2 · 3 = (−2)(−3) · 2).
2. Let F be a ﬁeld. Every element of F except 0 is a unit. Hence, every nonzero nonunit of F
is uniquely a product of atoms (vacuously!). That is, F has no nonzero nonunits.
Theorem 2.4.4. Let R be an integral domain. Then R is a UFD if and only if
1. every nonzero nonunit of R is a product of atoms and
2. every irreducible element is prime.
Proof. Suppose R is a UFD. Then (1) holds, by the deﬁnition of a UFD. It remains to show that if
x is irreducible, then x is prime. Suppose x | bc, and let ax = bc. Write a, b and c as products of
atoms, so that
a1 . . . ak
|
{z
}
a
x = b1 . . . bl
| {z }
b
c1 . . . cm
|
{z
}
c
.
Since these are two factorizations of ax = bc into products of atoms and x is an atom, x must be
an associate of some bi or some cj. Hence, x | b or x | c. Thus, x is prime.
Conversely, suppose (1) and (2) are given. Then to show R is a UFD, it sufﬁces to show that if
a1 . . . ar = b1 . . . bs
where the ai and bi are atoms, then r = s and the bi may be arranged so the ai and bi are
associates for i = 1, . . . , r. The proof proceeds by induction on r.
When r = 1, a1 = b1 . . . bs. Since a1 is prime, a1 divides bi for some i. Assume that a1 | b1,
and let b1 = ua1. Since b1 is an atom, u must be a unit, so a1 and b1 are associates. Furthermore,
a1 = b1 . . . bs = ua1b2 . . . bs, so 1 = (ub2) . . . bs. That is, s = 1 and a1 = b1. For the inductive step,
write a1 . . . ar = b1 . . . bs. Since a1 is prime, a1 divides bi for some i. As above, let b1 = ua1 where
u is a unit and a1 and b1 are associates. Then a1 . . . ar = b1 . . . bs = ua1b2 . . . bs, so a2 . . . ar =
ub2 . . . bs. Now the inductive hypothesis applies since we have r −1 factors on the left. It follows
that r = s and after reordering the bi, ai and bi are associates for i = 2, . . . , r. This completes the
induction.
To obtain more examples of a UFD and an integral domain which is not a UFD, we introduce:
Let d be a square free integer. The set
Z[
√
d] = {x + y
√
d : x, y ∈Z}
is a subring of C. It is called the ring of quadratic integers. Note that if x1, x2, y1, y2 ∈Z are
such that x1 + y1
√
d = x2 + y2
√
d, then x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 because d is non-square. Deﬁne a
function N : Z[
√
d] →Z by
N(x + y
√
d) = x2 −dy2
for all x, y ∈Z.
It is called the norm map on Z[
√
d].
Theorem 2.4.5.
1. If α ∈Z[
√
d] and N(α) = 0, then α = 0 = 0 + 0
√
d.
2. ∀α, β ∈Z[
√
d], N(αβ) = N(α)N(β) and (α | β ⇒N(α) | N(β)).
3. ∀α ∈Z[
√
d], α is a unit ⇔N(α) = ±1.
4. If α ∈Z[
√
d] and N(α) = p is a prime number, then α is irreducible in Z[
√
d].

2.4. Factorizations
61
Proof. Let x, y ∈Z be such that x2 −dy2 = 0. Then x2 = dy2. If y ̸= 0, then d = x2/y2, so
√
d = |x/y| ∈Q, which is a contradiction. Thus, we must have y = 0 which also forces x = 0.
This proves (1). A direct calculation gives (2). For (3), let α ∈Z[
√
d]. Suppose that α is a unit.
Then αβ = 1 for some β ∈Z[
√
d]. Thus, 1 = N(1) = N(αβ) = N(α)N(β), so N(α) divides 1
in Z. This gives N(1) = ±1. Conversely, assume that N(α) = ±1. Write α = x + y
√
d. Then
±1 = N(x + y
√
d) = x2 −y2d = (x + y
√
d)(x −y
√
d) which implies that x + y
√
d is a unit. Finally,
(4) follows from (3).
Example 2.4.2. The unit group of the ring Z[i] is {1, −1, i, −i} where i denotes √−1.
Remark. The equation x2 −dy2 = 1 is called the Pell’s equation. Every unit in Z[
√
d] is a
solution of Pell’s equation, or else of x2 −dy2 = −1, the negative Pell’s equation. If d < 0, then
x2 −dy2 ≥0. In this case the negative Pell’s equation has no solutions. In fact, Pell’s equation only
has very few solutions in this case, namely two, unless d = −1 when there are four solutions. If
d > 0, there are inﬁnitely many solutions to Pell’s equation. The negative Pell’s equation may or
may not have solutions.
Example 2.4.3. Consider the ring Z[√−5].
1. 1 −√−5, 1 + √−5, 2 and 3 are irreducible elements.
2. 1 + √−5 and 2 are not prime elements. Hence, Z[√−5] is not a UFD by Theorem 2.4.4.
Solution. (1) Assume that 1 −√−5 = (a + b√−5)(c + d√−5) for some a, b, c, d ∈Z. By taking
norms, we have
6 = (a2 + 5b2)(c2 + 5d2),
which implies that a2 + 5b2 = 1, 2, 3 or 6. Observe that b = 0 implies a2 = 1, so a + b
√
5 is a unit.
If b ̸= 0, then a2 + 5b2 ≥5, so a2 + 5b2 = 6. This forces that c2 + 5d2 = 1 and thus c + d√−5 is
a unit. Hence, 1 −√−5 is irreducible. Next, assume that 2 = (a + b√−5)(c + d√−5) for some
a, b, c, d ∈Z. By taking norms, we have
4 = (a2 + 5b2)(c2 + 5d2),
which implies that a2 + 5b2 = 1, 2 or 4. If a2 + 5b2 = 2, then 2 is a square modulo 5 which is a
contradiction. Thus, a2 + 5b2 = 1 or c2 + 5d2 = 1. Hence, a + b√−5 or c + d√−5 is a unit and so
2 is irreducible. Similarly, 1 + √−5 and 3 are irreducible.
(2) Note that
(1 +
√
−5)(1 −
√
−5) = 6 = 2 · 3.
Then (1 + √−5) | 2 · 3. But, if (1 + √−5) | 2 or (1 + √−5) | 3, then 6 | 4 or 6 | 9, which are absurd.
Thus, 1 + √−5 is not a prime element. Similarly, 2 | (1 + √−5)(1 −√−5). If 2 | (1 + √−5) or
2 | (1 −√−5), then 4 | 6, a contradiction. Hence, 2 is not a prime element.
Next, we talk about common factors, gcd and lcm of elements in an integral domain (cf.
Section 1.1). Let R be an integral domain and suppose a, b ∈R. A greatest common divisor of
a and b, gcd(a, b), is an element d ∈R which satisﬁes
1. d | a and d | b
and
2. ∀c ∈R, (c | a ∧c | b) ⇒c | d.
A least common multiple of a and b, lcm(a, b), is an element m ∈R which satisﬁes
1. a | m and b | m
and
2. ∀c ∈R, (a | c ∧b | c) ⇒m | c.
Remark. +3 and −3 are greatest common divisors of 12 and 15. 60 and −60 are least common
multiples of 12 and 15. Thus, the gcd or lcm of two elements is not unique, (however we adopt
the above notation anyway, e.g., gcd(12, 15) = 3 and gcd(12, 15) = −3 are both correct!). By their
deﬁnitions, they are unique up to associates as recorded in the next theorem.

62
2. Rings and Fields
Theorem 2.4.6. Let R be an integral domain and let a, b ∈R.
1. If d and d′ are gcd’s of a and b, then d and d′ are associates.
2. If m and m′ are lcm’s of a and b, then m and m′ are associates.
Let R be an integral domain and let Q(R) be the set of atoms of R. Deﬁne an equivalence
relation on Q(R) by a ∼b if a and b are associates. Then a set of representative atoms for R is a
set P = P(R) which contains exactly one atom from each equivalence class.
Example 2.4.4. Q(Z) = {±p | p is a prime} is the set of all atoms in Z.
P(Z) = {p | p is a positive prime} is a set of representative atoms.
P(Z) = {+2, −3, +5, −7, . . .} is another set of representative atoms.
We obtain the next theorem directly from the deﬁnition of a UFD.
Theorem 2.4.7. Let R be an integral domain and let P be a set of representative atoms for R.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) R is a UFD.
(ii) Every nonzero element of R can be expressed uniquely (up to order of factors) as a =
ubi1
1 · · · bik
k , where u is a unit of R, k ≥0, i1, . . . , ik > 0 and b1, . . . , bk are distinct elements
of P.
Another important result from R being a UFD is the existence of gcd and lcm for any pair
of nonzero elements. We also have the same relation for gcd and lcm as in elementary number
theory.
Theorem 2.4.8. Let R be a UFD and suppose a, b ∈R ∖{0}.
1. a and b have a gcd and an lcm.
2. Let P be a set of representative atoms for R. Then among the gcd’s of a and b there is exactly
one which is a product of elements of P. The same is true for the lcm’s of a and b.
3. If a and b are nonzero, gcd(a, b) = r, and lcm(a, b) = s, then ab and rs are associates. In
other words,
lcm(a, b) =
ab
gcd(a, b).
Proof. Let P be a set of representative atoms of R, and let b1, . . . , bk ∈P be all the atoms of P
which occur in either a or b when they are factored as in Theorem 2.4.7. Write
a = ubi1
1 · · · bik
k
and
b = vbj1
1 · · · bjk
k
where u and v are units and is, js ≥0. Then we derive:
(a) r = bmin(i1,j1)
1
· · · bmin(ir,jr)
r
is a gcd for a and b.
(b) s = bmax(i1,j1)
1
· · · bmax(ir,jr)
r
is a lcm for a and b.
(c) r is the only gcd of a and b which is a product of elements of P, and s is the only lcm of a and
b which is a product of elements of P.
(d) Since i + j = min(i, j) + max(i, j) for any integers i and j,
ab = uvbi1+j1
1
· · · bik+jk
k
= uvrs.
Hence, ab and rs are associates.
Remark. Suppose R is an integral domain and Ra + Rb = Rc. Then c = gcd(a, b). The converse
does not hold. E.g., Q[s, t], where s and t are indeterminates. Then gcd(s, t) = 1 and Q[s, t] ̸=
Q[s, t]s + Q[s, t]t.

2.4. Factorizations
63
Proof. Since Rc ⊇Ra and Rc ⊇Rb, c | a and c | b. Suppose d | a and d | b. Then Rd ⊇Ra + Rb = Rc, so
d | c. Hence, c = gcd(a, b).
Now, we shall prove that a PID is also a UFD. The following lemma is a key for R being a PID.
Lemma 2.4.9. [Ascending Chain Condition (ACC) for a PIR] Let R be a principal ideal ring. If
I1 ⊆I2 ⊆. . . is a chain of ideals in R, then ∃m ∈N, In = Im for all n ≥m.
Proof. Let I = S∞
n=1 In. Then I is an ideal of R. Since R is a PIR, ∃a ∈R, (a) = I. Then
a ∈S∞
n=1 In, so ∃m ∈N, a ∈Im. Thus, I = (a) ⊆Im ⊆I which implies that Im = I. Hence,
∀n ≥m, In = Im.
Lemma 2.4.10. If R is a PID and a is a nonzero nonunit element in R, then there exists an atom
p ∈R such that p | a.
Proof. Since a is nonunit, Ra ⫋R. Then there exists a maximal ideal M of R such that Ra ⊆M.
Since R is a PID, M = Rp for some atom p by Theorem 2.4.2. Since Ra ⊆Rp, p | a.
Theorem 2.4.11. Every PID is a UFD.
Proof. Let R be a PID. By Theorems 2.4.3 and 2.4.4, it sufﬁces to show that every nonzero nonunit
of R is a product of atoms. Let a ∈R be nonzero nonunit. By Lemma 2.4.10, there exists an atom
p1 dividing a. Write a = p1b1 for some b1 ∈R. If b1 is a unit, then a is an atom. If b1 is nonunit,
then there exists an atom p2 dividing b1, so we write a = p1b1 = p1p2b2. Continuing, we get a
strictly ascending chain of ideals
(a) ⊂(b1) ⊂(b2) ⊂· · · .
Since R is a PID, this chain must terminate, by the ACC in Lemma 2.4.9, with some br = prur
where ur is a unit and pr is an atom. Hence, a = p1p2 . . . prur, and so R is a UFD as desired.
Finally, we study a generalization of the division algorithm which leads to a special kind of
integral domains. An integral domain D is called a Euclidean domain if there exists a map
d : D ∖{0} →N ∪{0},
called a valuation map, such that
1. ∀a, b ∈D ∖{0}, d(a) ≤d(ab)
and
2. ∀a ∈D, b ∈D ∖{0}, ∃q, r ∈D, a = bq + r with r = 0 or d(r) < d(b).
Examples 2.4.5.
1. Any ﬁeld F is a Euclidean domain with valuation d(a) = 1 for all a ̸= 0.
2. From the division algorithm for Z (Theorem 1.1.1), we have Z is a Euclidean domain if we
deﬁne d(a) = |a| for all a ̸= 0.
3. The ring Z[i] = {m + ni : m, n ∈Z} is called the ring of Gaussian integer. This is a
subring of C, hence an integral domain. Its elements can be identiﬁed with the set of “lattice
points”, that is, points with integral coordinates in the complex plane. If a = m+ ni, we put
d(a) = a¯a = |a|2 = m2 + n2, the norm map. Then d(a) ∈N and d(ab) = d(a)d(b) ≥d(a) for
all a, b ∈Z[i] ∖{0}. To prove that d satisﬁes the condition of the deﬁnition of a Euclidean
domain, we note that if b ̸= 0, then ab−1 = µ+νi, where µ and ν are rational numbers. Now
we can ﬁnd integers u and v such that |u −µ| ≤1/2, |v −ν| ≤1/2. Set ε = µ −u, η = ν −v,
so that |ε| ≤1/2 and |η| ≤1/2. Then
a = b[(u + ε) + (v + η)i] = bq + r
where q = u + vi is in Z[i]. Since r = a −bq, r ∈Z[i]. Moreover if r ̸= 0, then
d(r) = |r|2 = |b|2(ε2 + η2) ≤|b|2(1/4 + 1/4) = d(b)/2.
Thus, d(r) < d(b). Hence, Z[i] is a Euclidean domain.

2. Rings and Fields
Theorem 2.4.12. A Euclidean domian is a PID, and hence is a UFD.
Proof. Let I be an ideal in a Euclidean domain D. If I = {0}, we have I = (0). Otherwise, let
b ̸= 0 be an element of I for which d(b) is minimal for the nonzero elements of I. Let a be any
element of I. Then a = bq + r for some q, r ∈D with r = 0 or d(r) < d(b). Since r = a −bq ∈I
and d(r) < d(b), we must have r = 0 by the choice of b in I. Hence, a = bq, so I = (b).
Example 2.4.6. Let θ = 1
2(1 + √−19) and Z[θ] = {a + bθ : a, b ∈Z}. Assume that u = a + bθ is a
unit in Z[θ]. Then (a + bθ)(c + dθ) = 1 for some c, d ∈Z. The squares of absolute value on both
sides give
((2a + b)2 + 19b2)((2c + d)2 + 19d2) = 16
which implies b = d = 0 and so ac = 1. Hence, the unit group of Z[θ] = {±1}. By a similar
technique, we can show that 2 and 3 are irreducible in Z[θ]. Now, suppose that d is a valuation
map on Z[θ]. Choose m ∈Z[θ] which is nonzero nonunit such that d(m) is minimal. First, we
divide 2 by m and get q, r ∈Z[θ] and
2 = mq + r
with d(r) < d(m) or r = 0.
This means r = 0, 1 or −1. If r = 0, then m | 2 which forces m = ±2 since 2 is irreducible and m
is not a unit. Similarly, if r = −1, then m = ±3. The case r = 1 cannot happen, for if it did, then
m | 1, so m is a unit. Next, we divide θ by m in the same way, we obtain q′, r′ ∈Z[θ] and
θ = mq′ + r′
with d(r′) < d(m) or r′ = 0.
Again, we have r′ = 0, 1 or −1. Thus, one of θ, θ + 1 or θ −1 is divisible by m. But m = ±2 or ±3
and it is easy to see that none of these quotients is in R. This contradiction tell us that Z[θ] is not
a Euclidean domain.
Next, we shall show that Z[θ] is a PID. Let I be a nonzero ideal of Z[θ]. Choose b ∈I so
that |b| is as small as possible. We aim to show that I = Z[θ]b. Suppose not. Then there is
an element a ∈I ∖Z[θ]b. Note that ap −bq ∈I for all p, q ∈Z[θ], so if we can ﬁnd p, q with
|ap −bq| < |b| (or equivalently |(a/b)p −q| < 1), then we shall be done. Since we may replace
a by any element a′ = a −bq, we can subtract any desired element of R from a/b. In particular,
we can assume that the imaginary part y of a/b = x + iy lies between ±
√
19/4. Now, if the
imaginary part of a/b lies strictly between ±
√
3/2, then a/b lies at distance less than 1 from some
rational integer and we are done. Thus, we may assume the imaginary part of a/b lies between
√
3/2 and
√
19/4 (or the negative of this, where the argument is similar). Hence, the imaginary
part of 2(a/b) −(1 + √−19)/2 lies between
√
3 −
√
19/2 and 0. But
√
19 <
√
27 = 3
√
3, so
√
3/2 >
√
19/2 −
√
3 > 0. Therefore, the imaginary part of 2(a/b) −(1 + √−19)/2 is sufﬁcient
small that the complex number lies at a distance less than 1 for some rational integer. In both
cases, we have found elements p, q ∈Z[θ] such that |ap−bq| < |b| which is a contradiction. Hence,
Z[θ] is a PID.
Remark. In conclusion, recall that Z is an integral domain which is not a ﬁeld and Z[√−5] is not
a UFD. Besides, Z[θ] = {a + bθ : a, b ∈Z}, where θ = (1 + √−19)/2, is a PID which is not a
Euclidean domain as shown above. Finally, Z[x] (in the next section) is a UFD which is not a PID.

Polynomial Rings
One of familiar topic in elementary algebra is “polynomials”. Algebraic equations usually involve
factorization of polynomials. Here, we treat them in a more abstract way with the things that we
have studied from the previous section. There will be many important results in this section.
2.5.1
Polynomials and Their Roots
Let R be a ring with identity 1 and let x be a symbol called an indeterminate, not representing any
element in R. Let R[x] denote the set of all symbols a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn where n ∈N ∪{0}, ai ∈
R, x0 = 1, x1 = x. For i ∈N, let xi denote 1 · xi. In the symbol a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, we may
drop aixi if ai = 0. Each element a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn is called a polynomial and ai is called the
coefﬁcient of xi for i ∈{1, . . . , n} and a0 is called the constant term.
For p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn and q(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm in R[x], we can write
p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + akxk and q(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bkxk where k ≥max{m, n}, ai = 0 if
i > n and bj = 0 if j > m and we deﬁne
1. p(x) = q(x) ⇔ai = bi for all i ∈{0, 1, . . . , k}
2. p(x) + q(x) = (a0 + b0) + (a1 + b1)x + · · · + (ak + bk)xk and
3. p(x)q(x) = c0 + c1x + · · · + cn+mxn+m, where cl = Pl
i=0 aibl−i(= a0bl + a1bl−1 + · · · + alb0)
for all l ∈{0, 1, . . . , n + m}.
Hence, under the operation deﬁned above R[x] is a ring which has 1 as its identity and contains
R as a subring (considered elements as constant polynomials). The ring R[x] is called the ring of
polynomials over R. If R is commutative, so is R[x].
Set R[x1, x2] = R[x1][x2] and R[x1, . . . , xn] = R[x1, . . . , xn−1][xn] if n > 2.
If p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈R[x] and an ̸= 0, then the degree of p(x), denoted by
deg p(x), is deﬁned to be n. For technical reasons, we deﬁne the degree of the zero polynomial to
be −∞and adopt the following conventions: (−∞) < n and (−∞) + n = −∞= n + (−∞) for
every integer n; (−∞) + (−∞) = −∞.
Let f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn. If an ̸= 0, an is called the leading coefﬁcient of f(x) and
f(x) is a monic polynomial if an = 1. If R is commutative and c ∈R, then
f(x) 7→f(c) := a0 + a1c + · · · + ancn
gives a homomorphism from R[x] to R, called the evaluation at c. In addition, if f(c) = 0, then
c is called a root of f(x).
The following statements are clearly true.
1. Every unit in R is a unit in R[x].
2. If f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + amxm, g(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bnxn ∈R[x] and ambn ̸= 0, then
deg(f(x)g(x)) = m + n.
In particular, if R is an integral domain, we have:
Theorem 2.5.1. Let R be an integral domain.
1. R[x] is an integral domain.
2. ∀f(x), g(x) ∈R[x] ∖{0}, deg f(x)g(x) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).
3. The set of all units of R[x] is the set of all units of R. In particular, U(Z[x]) = {±1} and
U(F[x]) = F ∖{0}, where F is a ﬁeld.
4. ∀a ∈R, a is irreducible in R ⇔a is irreducible in R[x].
5. ∀a, b ∈R, b is a unit ⇒a + bx is irreducible in R[x].
Proof. (1) and (2) are clear from the above observation. Note that if f(x) is a unit, then f(x)g(x) =
1 for some g(x) ∈R[x], so deg f(x) + deg g(x) = deg 1 = 0 by (2). This forces that deg f(x) =
0 = deg g(x) which implies that f(x) lies in R and (3) follows. Next, let a ∈R. If a is irre-
ducible in R[x], then a is clearly irreducible in R. On the other hand, if a = f(x)g(x) for some

2.5. Polynomial Rings
67
nonzero nonunits f(x) and g(x) in R[x], we have 0 = deg a = deg f(x) + deg g(x), so this again
gives deg f(x) = deg g(x) = 0. This means that f(x) and g(x) indeed lie in R, and thus a is
reducible in R. Finally, let a, b ∈R with b a unit. Then deg(a + bx) = 1. If a + bx = f(x)g(x) for
some f(x), g(x) ∈R[x], then 1 = deg f(x) + deg g(x), so f(x) or g(x) must lie in R, say f(x) = c a
constant in R and g(x) = u+vx. Since b = cv is a unit, c is a unit. Hence, a+bx is irreducible.
Theorem 2.5.2. [Division Algorithm] Let R be a ring, f(x), g(x) ∈R[x] and g(x) ̸= 0. Assume
that the leading coefﬁcient of g(x) is a unit in R. Then ∃unique q(x), r(x) ∈R[x] such that
f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x) where r(x) = 0 or deg r(x) < deg g(x).
Proof. If there exists an h(x) ∈R[x] such that f(x) = h(x)g(x), let q(x) = h(x) and r(x) = 0.
Assume that f(x) ̸= h(x)g(x) for all h(x) ∈R[x]. Let
S = {deg(f(x) −h(x)g(x)) : h(x) ∈R[x]} ⊆N ∪{0}.
Then S ̸= ∅. By the Well-Ordering Principle, there exists a polynomial q(x) in R[x] such that
deg(f(x) −q(x)g(x)) has the least degree and we may write r(x) for f(x) −q(x)g(x). Then
r(x) ̸= 0. Assume that deg r(x) ≥deg g(x). Write r(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, an ̸= 0, and
g(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm with bm a unit.
Since deg r(x) ≥deg g(x), n −m ≥0.
Let
s(x) = r(x) −anb−1
m xn−mg(x). Thus, deg s(x) < n and
s(x) = f(x) −q(x)g(x) −anb−1
m xn−mg(x) = f(x) −(q(x) −anb−1
m xn−m)g(x),
so s(x) ∈S and deg s(x) < deg r(x), a contradiction.
To prove that q(x) and r(x) are unique, suppose that q2(x) and r2(x) are polynomials such
that
f(x) = g(x)q2(x) + r2(x)
where r2(x) = 0 or deg r2(x) < deg g(x).
Then g(x)q(x) + r(x) = f(x) = g(x)q2(x) + r2(x). Subtracting yields
g(x)[q(x) −q2(x)] = r2(x) −r(x).
Since the leading coefﬁcient of g(x) is assumed to be a unit, we have
deg(g(x)[q(x) −q2(x)]) = deg g(x) + deg(q(x) −q2(x)).
Since deg(r2(x) −r(x)) < deg g(x), this relation can hold only if q(x) −q2(x) is zero, i.e., q(x) =
q2(x), and hence ﬁnally r(x) = r2(x).
For a ﬁeld R, the leading coefﬁcient of a nonzero polynomial g(x) in R[x] is always a unit
in R, so the division algorithm above gives:
Corollary 2.5.3. If F is a ﬁeld, then F[x] is a Euclidean domain with valuation d(p(x)) = deg p(x)
for all p(x) ∈F[x] ∖{0}. Moreover, F[x] is a PID and a UFD.
Theorem 2.5.4. [Remainder Theorem] Let R be a ring and f(x) ∈R[x]. Then for all c ∈R, the
remainder when x −c divides f(x) is f(c).
Proof. Let c ∈R. By Theorem 2.5.2, there exist unique q(x) ∈R[x] and r ∈R such that f(x) =
q(x)(x −c) + r. Then f(c) = q(c)(c −c) + r = r.
Corollary 2.5.5. Let R be a ring.
1. If f(x) ∈R[x], c ∈R and f(c) = 0, then f(x) = q(x)(x −c) for some q(x) ∈R[x].
2. If R is commutative, f(x) ∈R[x] and c ∈R, then f(c) = 0 ⇔(x −c) | f(x) in R[x].
3. Let R be an integral domain, f(x) ∈R[x], deg f(x) = 2 or 3 and the leading coefﬁcient of
f(x) is a unit in R. Then f(x) has a root in R ⇔f(x) is reducible in R[x].

68
2. Rings and Fields
Proof. (1) and (2) are clear. For (3), assume that c is a root of f(x). Then f(x) = q(x)(x −c)
for some q(x) ∈R[x]. Since deg f(x) is 2 or 3, deg q(x) is 1 or 2, so f(x) is reducible. Conversely,
suppose that f(x) = g(x)h(x), where g(x), h(x) ∈R[x] of degree ≥1. Since deg f(x) = 2 or 3,
deg g(x) = 1 or deg h(x) = 1. Hence, f(x) has a root in R.
Examples 2.5.1.
1. x2 −3 is irreducible over Q but not over R.
2. x2 + 1 is irreducible over R but not over C since x2 + 1 = (x −i)(x + i).
3. x3 −x + 1 is irreducible over Z3 but reducible over R by the intermediate value theorem. In
general, every polynomial of odd degree over R has a root in R (Theorem 5.5.3).
4. x4 + 4 has no roots in R but it can be factored as (x2 −2x2 + 2)(x2 + 2x2 + 2) in R[x].
Corollary 2.5.6. Let F be a ﬁeld.
1. If f(x) is a polynomial over F of degree n, then f(x) has at most n roots in F.
2. If f(x) and g(x) are polynomials over F
of degree ≤
n such that f(α1)
=
g(α1), . . . , f(αn+1) = g(αn+1) where α1, . . . , αn+1 are distinct elements of F, then f(x) =
g(x).
3. If F is inﬁnite and f(x) and g(x) are polynomials over F such that f(α) = g(α) for all
α ∈F, then f(x) = g(x).
Proof. We shall prove (1) by induction on k = deg f(x). It is clear when f(x) is linear. Assume
that k > 1 and any polynomials of degree k have at most k roots in F.
Suppose that f(x)
is of degree k + 1. The statement is true when f(x) has no root in F. Otherwise, let α be a
root of f(x) in F. Then f(x) = (x −α)q(x) for some polynomial q(x) ∈F[x] of degree k. By the
inductive hypothesis, q(x) has at most k roots. Hence, f(x) has at most k+1 roots. The remaining
statements follow from the ﬁrst one.
Remarks.
1. f(x) = x2 −1 has four roots in Z12, namely 1, −1, 5, −5.
2. Corollary 2.5.6 says that two polynomials over an inﬁnite ﬁeld F which deﬁned the same
function on F are identical. This is NOT true if F is ﬁnite. Let F = Zp, f(x) = x and
g(x) = xp. Then f(α) = g(α) for all α ∈Zp but f(x) ̸= g(x).
Theorem 2.5.7. Let F be a ﬁeld and F[x] the polynomial ring over F. Then linear polynomials
are the only atoms in F[x] if and only if each polynomial f(x) ∈F[x] of positive degree has a root
in F.
Proof. Suppose that linear polynomials are the only atoms in F[x]. Let f(x) be a polynomial of
positive degree over F. Since F[x] is a UFD, f(x) = α1(x) · · · αk(x), a product of atoms. Each
αi(x) is linear, so αi(x) = bi(x −ci) (bi, ci ∈F with bi ̸= 0). Then (x −ci) | f(x), so c1, . . . , ck are
roots of f(x) in F. Conversely, assume that every f(x) ∈F[x] of positive degree has a root in F.
Let α(x) be an atom in F[x]. We claim that α(x) is linear. For, let b ∈F be a root of α(x). Then
(x −b) | α(x) so α(x) = (x −b)β(x) for some β(x) ∈F[x]. Since α(x) is an atom, β(x) must be a
unit. That is, β(x) is a constant lying in F ∖{0}. Thus, α(x) is a linear polynomial.
A ﬁeld F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld if every non-constant polynomial has a root in F.
Example 2.5.2. By the fundamental theorem of algebra (Theorem 5.5.6), the only atoms in C[x]
are linear polynomials. Thus, C is an algebraically closed ﬁeld.
Theorem 2.5.8. Let R be an integral domain and f(x) ∈R[x] a nonzero polynomial. If α1, . . . , αk
are distinct roots of f(x), then (x −α1) . . . (x −αk) divides f(x).

2.5. Polynomial Rings
69
Proof. We shall prove this result by induction of k.
Corollary 2.5.5 (1) gives the basis step.
Assume k > 1. By the inductive hypothesis (x −α1) . . . (x −αk−1) divides f(x), so let f(x) =
(x −α1) . . . (x −αk−1)g(x) for some g(x) ∈R[x]. Then
0 = f(αk) = (αk −α1) . . . (αk −αk−1)g(αk).
Thus, g(αk) = 0 since R is an integral domain, so (x−αk) | g(x). It follows that (x−α1) . . . (x−αk)
divides f(x).
2.5.2
Factorizations in Polynomial Rings
When factor a polynomial, we ﬁrst look for some common factors on its coefﬁcients. For example,
2x3 +4 = 2(x3 +2). Taking the gcd of the coefﬁcients out allows us to concentrate on polynomials
with no common factor on their coefﬁcients and leads to the following deﬁnitions.
Let R be a UFD and suppose that f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn is a nonzero polynomial in
R[x]. The content of f(x) is the gcd of a0, . . . , an. We say that f(x) is primitive if the content of
f(x) is unit in R, i.e., a0, . . . , an have no common factor except units.
Theorem 2.5.9. [Gauss’ lemma] Let R be a UFD and f(x), g(x) ∈R[x]. If f(x) and g(x) are
primitive, so is f(x)g(x).
Proof. Let
f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + amxm
g(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bnxn
f(x)g(x) = c0 + c1x + · · · + cm+nxm+n.
We shall suppose that f(x)g(x) is not primitive and obtain a contradiction. Let a ∈R be an atom
of R which divides all of c0, . . . , cm+n. Since R is a UFD, every atom is a prime, so Ra is a prime
ideal. Then (R/Ra)[x] is an integral domain. Since R[x]/R[x]a ∼= (R/Ra)[x], R[x]a is a prime
ideal. Let
−: R[x] →R[x]/R[x]a
be the canonical map. Since a divides c0, . . . , cm+n, ¯f(x)¯g(x) = 0. But a does not divide all of
a0, . . . , am or all of b0, . . . , bn, since f and g are primitive. Thus, ¯f(x) ̸= 0, ¯g(x) ̸= 0. This is a
contradiction since ¯f(x)¯g(x) = 0 and ¯f(x), ¯g(x) lie in R[x]/P which is an integral domain. Hence,
f(x)g(x) is primitive, as claimed.
Theorem 2.5.10. Let R be a UFD and f(x), g(x) nonzero polynomials of R[x]. Then:
1. f(x) is primitive ⇔the content of f(x) is 1.
2. If a is the content of f, then f(x) = af1(x) where f1(x) is primitive.
3. If f(x) = af1(x) and f1(x) is primitive, then a is the content of f(x).
4. If a and b are the contents of f(x) and g(x), respectively, then ab is the content of f(x)g(x).
Proof. (1), (2) and (3) are immediate from the deﬁnition of gcd. For the last statement, by (2),
we write f(x) = af1(x) and g(x) = bg1(x) where f1(x) and g1(x) are primitive. By Gauss’ lemma,
f1(x)g1(x) is primitive, and
f(x)g(x) = af1(x)bg1(x) = (ab)(f1(x)g1(x)).
Hence, ab is the content of f(x)g(x), by (3).

Theorem 2.5.11. Let R be a UFD and let F = Q(R) = {r/s : r, s ∈R, s ̸= 0} be its ﬁeld
of quotients.
Suppose f(x) is an irreducible polynomial in R[x].
Then f(x), considered as a
polynomial in F[x], is irreducible in F[x]. In particular, if f(x) ∈Z[x] is irreducible over Z, it is
irreducible over Q.
Proof. Suppose f(x) = g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are polynomials of positive degree in F[x].
Let g(x) = a0/b0 + (a1/b1)x + · · · + (am/bm)xm and h(x) = c0/d0 + (c1/d1)x + · · · + (cn/dn)xn.
Let b be a least common multiple of the bi and d a least common multiple of the dj so that
g1(x) = bg(x)
and
h1(x) = dh(x)
lie in R[x]. Then
bdf(x) = bg(x)dh(x) = g1(x)h1(x).
By Theorem 2.5.10, let g1(x) = ug2(x) and h1(x) = vh2(x) where u is the content of g1(x) and v
is the content of h1(x), and g2(x) and h2(x) are primitive polynomials in R[x]. Thus,
bdf(x) = g1(x)h1(x) = uvg2(x)h2(x).
Since g2(x) and h2(x) are primitive, so is g2(x)h2(x) and hence the equation above implies that
bd | uv in R. Canceling, we obtain
f(x) = wg2(x)h2(x)
where w = uv
bd ∈R.
Therefore, f(x) is reducible in R[x], which proves the theorem.
Let R be a UFD and F = Q(R) its ﬁeld of quotients. Suppose
h(x) = a0/b0 + (a1/b1)x + · · · + (an/bn)xn ∈F[x],
where a0/b0, a1/b1, . . . , an/bn are in “lowest terms”. That is, ai and bi have no common factor. Let
b = lcm(b0, . . . , bn). Then
bh(x) = a0(b/b0) + a1(b/b1)x + · · · + an(b/bn)xn
is in R[x]. Let a be the content of bh(x). It happens that a = gcd(a0, . . . , an), although knowing
this is not essential. The main point is that
h1(x) = (b/a)h(x)
is a primitive polynomial in R[x]. Moreover, the proof of Theorem 2.5.11 shows that if f(x) ∈
R[x], then h(x) | f(x) in F[x] ⇔h1(x) | f(x) in R[x]. In particular, suppose f(x) ∈R[x], and
r/s ∈F is a root of f(x) where r and s are relatively prime. Then h(x) = x −(r/s) divides f(x)
in F[x], so h1(x) = sx −r divides f(x) in R[x]. Thus, we have:
Theorem 2.5.12. Let R be a UFD and F its ﬁeld of quotients.
Suppose f(x) ∈R[x] where
f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn and r/s ∈F is a root of f(x) where r and s are relatively prime.
Then s | an and r | a0 if r ̸= 0.
Proof. The remarks above show that (sx −r) | (a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn) in R[x]. It is easy to see
that this implies our results.
Remarks.
1. Suppose f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈Z[x], where a0 ̸= 0. Then there are only
ﬁnitely many rationals which can possibly be roots of f(x), namely the fractions r/s where
r | a0 and s | an.

2.5. Polynomial Rings
71
2. Note that if an = 1 above, then s = ±1 and r/s ∈Z. In other words, if an = 1, then every
rational root of f(x) is an integer.
Another important criterion on irreduciblity in Q[x] is the next theorem.
Theorem 2.5.13. [Eisenstein’s Criterion] Let f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn lies in Z[x], and
suppose that there is a prime number p such that
1. p ∤an,
2. p | a0, . . . , an−1,
and
3. p2 ∤a0.
Then f(x) is irreducible in Q[x]. Moreover, if f(x) is primitive, then f(x) is irreducible in Z[x].
Proof. We shall suppose that f(x) is reducible in Q[x] and obtain a contradiction. By dividing f(x)
by its content, we may assume that f(x) is primitive, this does not affect either the hypothesis
or the reducibility of f(x) in Q[x]. By Theorem 2.5.11, f(x) is reducible in Z[x], so let f(x) =
g(x)h(x) where g(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm and h(x) = c0 + c1x + · · · + cn−mxn−m are in Z[x].
Note that since f(x) is primitive, neither g(x) nor h(x) is constant. That is, m ≥1 and n −m ≥1.
Let −: Z[x] →Zp[x] be the canonical projection. Then ¯f(x) = ¯anxn where ¯an ̸= ¯0 since p ∤an,
so ¯g(x)¯h(x) = ¯f(x) = ¯anxn. Since Zp[x] is a UFD, this forms ¯g(x) = ¯bmxm, ¯h(x) = ¯cn−mxn−m, so
that ¯b0 = ¯c0 = ¯0 (i.e., p divides b0 and c0). But then p2 | a0 since a0 = b0c0, which contradicts part
(3) of the hypotheses. Hence, f(x) is irreducible in Q[x] as claimed.
Example 2.5.3. f(x) = 2x5 −6x3 + 9x2 −15 is irreducible in Q[x] and in Z[x].
Corollary 2.5.14. The pth cyclotomic polynomial
Φp(x) = xp −1
x −1 = xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1
is irreducible in Q[x] for any prime p.
Proof. The polynomial
g(x) = Φp(x + 1) = (x + 1)p −1
(x + 1) −1 = xp−1 +
p
1

xp−2 + · · · + p
satisﬁes the Eisenstein criterion for the prime p and is thus irreducible in Q[x]. But clearly if
Φp(x) = h(x)r(x) were a nontrivial factorization of Φp(x) in Z[x], then
Φp(x + 1) = g(x) = h(x + 1)r(x + 1)
would give a nontrivial factorization of g(x) in Z[x]. Thus, Φp(x) must also be irreducible in
Q[x].
We next wish to prove a famous theorem of Gauss: if R is a UFD, so is R[x]. Recall the criterion
given in Theorem 2.4.4:
an integral domain is a UFD ⇔
1. every nonzero nonunit is a product of atoms and
2. every atom is prime.
Suppose R is a UFD. We ﬁrst observe that R[x] is an integral domain, so this presents no
problem. We shall establish the criteria above for R[x] (and these show that R[x] is a UFD) by
doing three things:
(a) We determine all atoms of R[x] (Theorem 2.5.15).
(b) We show that they are primes (Theorem 2.5.16).

72
2. Rings and Fields
(c) We show that every nonzero nonunit of R[x] is a product of atoms and conclude that R[x]
is a UFD (Theorem 2.5.17).
Theorem 2.5.15. Let R be a UFD, F its ﬁeld of quotients and f(x) ∈F[x]. Then f(x) is an atom
of R[x] ⇔either
(1) f(x) ∈R and f(x) is an atom of R
or
(2) f(x) is a primitive polynomial of degree n ≥1 and f(x) is irreducible in F[x].
Proof. Assume that f(x) is an atom of R[x]. If deg f(x) = 0, then f(x) ∈R, and clearly f(x) must
be an atoms of R. Otherwise, suppose that deg f(x) = n ≥1, and let a be the content of f(x).
Then f(x) = af1(x) where f1(x) is primitive. Since f(x) is irreducible in R[x], a must be a unit
in R, so f(x) is primitive. Again, since f(x) is irreducible in R[x], it is also irreducible in F[x] by
Theorem 2.5.11.
Conversely, assume that (1) and (2) hold. If f(x) is an atom of R, it is clearly an atom of R[x]
(Theorem 2.5.1). Suppose f(x) is a primitive polynomial of degree n ≥1 and f(x) is irreducible
in F[x]. We claim that f(x) is an atom of R[x]. For, suppose not, and let
f(x) = g(x)h(x),
where g(x) and h(x) are nonunits of R[x].
(a) If g(x) or h(x) lies in R, then f(x) is not primitive, a contradiction.
(b) If g(x) and h(x) both have positive degree, then f(x) is reducible in F[x], again a contradic-
tion.
Hence, if f(x) is an atom of R[x], it has the form (1) or (2), as required.
Theorem 2.5.16. Let R be a UFD and f(x) an atom of R[x]. Then R[x]f(x) is a prime ideal of
R[x]. That is, f(x) is a prime element.
Proof. We consider separately the two types of atoms in R[x] given in Theorem 2.5.15.
Case 1. a ∈R is an atom of R. Since R is a UFD, every atom is a prime, so Ra is a prime ideal.
Then (R/Ra)[x] is an integral domain. Since R[x]/R[x]a ∼= (R/Ra)[x], R[x]a is a prime ideal, so
a is prime.
Case 2. f(x) is a primitive polynomial of degree n ≥1 and f(x) is irreducible in F[x] where F is
the quotient ﬁeld of R. First we claim that F[x]f(x)∩R[x] = R[x]f(x). Clearly, f(x) ∈F[x]f(x)∩
R[x]. Conversely, we suppose g(x)f(x) ∈R[x] with g(x) = a0/b0 + (a1/b1)x + · · · + (an/bn)xn ∈
F[x]. We can ﬁnd relatively prime a, b ∈R such that (b/a)g(x) = g1(x) where g1(x) is a primitive
polynomial in R[x]. (In fact, a = gcd(a0, a1, . . . , an) and b = lcm(b0, b1, . . . , bn) will do, provided
each ai and bi are relatively prime.) Thus, (b/a)g(x)f(x) = g1(x)f(x) ∈R[x]. By Gauss’ lemma,
g1(x)f(x) is a primitive polynomial. In connection with the above equation, this forces b to be a
unit of R, so g(x) = (a/b)g1(x) ∈R[x]. Hence, g(x)f(x) ∈R[x]f(x) which proves our claim.
By the second isomorphism theorem, we have
R[x]/R[x]f(x) = R[x]/(R[x] ∩F[x]f(x)) ∼= (R[x] + F[x]f(x))/F[x]f(x).
Since (R[x] + F[x]f(x))/F[x]f(x) ⊆F[x]/F[x]f(x) which is a ﬁeld because f(x) is irreducible in
F[x], R[x]+F[x]f(x))/F[x]f(x) is an integral domain. Thus, R[x]/R[x]f(x) is an integral domain,
so R[x]f(x) is a prime ideal. Therefore, f(x) is prime and this proves the theorem.
Theorem 2.5.17. [Gauss] If R is a UFD, so is R[x]. Hence, if R is a UFD, so is R[x1, . . . , xn] for
all n ∈N.

2.5. Polynomial Rings
73
Proof. We know all the atoms of R[x] by Theorem 2.5.15 and Theorem 2.5.16 tells us that each
atom of R[x] is prime. Hence, (by Theorem 2.4.4) to verify that R[x] is a UFD, it remains to show
that each nonzero nonunit f(x) ∈R[x] is a product of atoms.
Case 1. deg f(x) = 0, i.e., f(x) ∈R. Since R is a UFD and every atom of R is an atom of R[x], we
can express f(x) as a product of atoms in R, and so in R[x].
Case 2. deg f(x) = n ≥1. Let f(x) = f1(x) . . . fk(x) where (a) each fi(x) has degree ≥1 and
(b) k is as large as possible. Such a factorization exists because any factorization which satisﬁes
(a) has at most n terms since n = deg f(x) = deg f1(x) + · · · + deg fk(x) ≥k. Now, let ai be the
content of fi(x), and let fi(x) = aigi(x) where gi(x) is a primitive polynomial.
We claim that gi(x) is an atom in R[x] because if gi(x) = r(x)s(x) where r(x) and s(x) are
nonunits, then r(x) and s(x) cannot lie in R, since gi(x) is primitive.
In addition, r(x) and
s(x) cannot both have positive degree because then we could write f(x) as a product of k + 1
polynomials of positive degree, which violates (b). Thus, each gi(x) is an atom as desired. Hence,
f(x) = f1(x) . . . fk(x)
= a1g1(x) . . . akgk(x)
= a1 . . . akg1(x) . . . gk(x)
= ag1(x) . . . gk(x), where a ∈R.
By Case 1, a can be written as a product of atoms in R[x] and therefore shows that f(x) is a
product of atoms in R[x], which proves R[x] is a UFD.
Example 2.5.4. Since Z is a UFD, we have Z[x] is also a UFD. However, in the following exercises,
we shall know that the ideal (x, 2) of Z[x] is not principal, so Z[x] is an example of a UFD which
is not a PID.

p | a0, a1, . . . , ak, p ∤ak+1 and p2 ∤a0, then P(x) has an irreducible factor in Z[x] of degree greater than k.
Extend this result to a UFD similar to the last question of Exercises 2.5.

Field Extensions
Let F be a ﬁeld and f(x) a polynomial over F of degree n ∈N. Then the quotient ring
F[x]/(f(x)) = {g(x) + (f(x)) : g(x) ∈F[x]}
= {g(x) + (f(x)) : g(x) ∈F[x] and g(x) = 0 or deg g(x) < n}
= {a0 + a1x + · · · + an−1xn−1 + (f(x)) : ai ∈F}
by the division algorithm. Thus, if F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, then F[x]/(f(x)) is a commutative ring
of |F|n elements. In addition, if f(x) is irreducible in F[x], then (f(x)) is a maximal ideal, so
F[x]/(f(x)) is a ﬁeld. Note that F is isomorphic to {c + (f(x)) : c ∈F}, so we may embed F into
F[x]/(f(x)) by using the inclusion map.
Examples 2.6.1.
1. R[x]/(x2 + 1) is a ﬁeld isomorphic to C (with the map f(x) 7→f(i)).
2. Z11[x]/(x2 + 3) is a ﬁeld of 121 elements.
Under the above idea, if a polynomial over a ﬁeld does not possess a a root in its own ﬁeld,
we shall create a bigger ﬁeld where we can ﬁnd a root of it.
2.6.1
Algebraic and Transcendental Extensions
Before we extend a ﬁeld, we ﬁrst determine the smallest one possible according to its characteris-
tic. Let F be a ﬁeld. The intersection of all subﬁelds of F is the smallest subﬁeld of F, called the
prime ﬁeld of F.
Theorem 2.6.1. Let F be a ﬁeld with the prime subﬁeld P and 1F denote the identity of F.
1. If char F = p, a prime, then P = {n · 1F : n = 0, 1, . . . , p −1} ∼= Z/pZ.
2. If char F = 0, then P = {(m · 1F )(n · 1F )−1 : m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0} ∼= Q.
Proof. Since P is a ﬁeld, 1F ∈P, so {n · 1F : n ∈Z} ⊆P. Deﬁne ϕ : Z →P by ϕ(n) = n · 1F for
all n ∈Z. Then ϕ is a ring homomorphism and im ϕ = {n · 1F : n ∈Z}, so Z/ ker ϕ ∼= im ϕ.
(1) Assume that char F = p is a prime. Then im ϕ = {n · 1F : n = 0, 1, . . . , p −1} and p is the
smallest positive integer such that p ∈ker ϕ, so ker ϕ = pZ. Hence, im ϕ ∼= Z/pZ which is a ﬁeld,
so P = im ϕ ∼= Z/pZ.

2.6. Field Extensions
75
(2) Assume that char F = 0. Then ϕ is a monomorphism. Since {n · 1F : n ∈Z} ⊆P and
P is a subﬁeld of F, {(m · 1F )(n · 1F )−1 : m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0} ⊆P.
Deﬁne ¯ϕ : Q →P by
¯ϕ(m/n) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n)−1 for all m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0. Then ¯ϕ is a monomorphism and ¯ϕ|Z = ϕ. Thus,
Q ∼= im ¯ϕ = {(m · 1F )(n · 1F )−1 : m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0} which is a subﬁeld of P, and hence they are
equal.
In this section, we require some background in vector spaces. A ﬁeld K is said to be an
extension of a ﬁeld F if F is a subring of K.
Remark. By Theorem 2.6.1, any ﬁeld can be considered as an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld Q or Zp
for some prime p.
Let K be an extension ﬁeld of F. The degree of K over F, [K : F], is the dimension of K
as a vector space over F. More generally, if a ﬁeld F is a subring of a ring R, then [R : F] is the
dimension of R as a vector space over F. For example, [C : R] = 2 and [R : Q] is inﬁnite (in fact
[R : Q] = |R|).
Theorem 2.6.2. If [L : K] and [K : F] are ﬁnite, then [L : F] is ﬁnite and
[L : F] = [L : K][K : F].
In fact, [L : F] = [L : K][K : F] whenever F ⊆K ⊆L.
Proof. With F ⊆K ⊆L, let {βj}j∈J be a basis of K over F and {αi}i∈I a basis of L over K.
Every element of L can be written uniquely as a ﬁnite linear combination of the elements of
{αi}i∈I with coefﬁcients in K, and every such coefﬁcient can be written uniquely as a ﬁnite linear
combination of the elements of {βj}j∈J with coefﬁcients in F. Hence, every element of L can be
written uniquely as a ﬁnite linear combination of the elements of {αiβj}i∈I,j∈J with coefﬁcients
in K: {αiβj}i∈I,j∈J is a basis of L over F, and [L : F] = |I × J| = [L : K][K : F].
Notation. Let K be an extension ﬁeld of F.
1. If t1, . . . , tn are indeterminates over F, then F(t1, . . . , tn) denotes the ﬁeld of quotients of
the polynomial ring F[t1, . . . , tn].
2. If u1, . . . , un ∈K (or S ⊆K), then F[u1, . . . , un] (or F[S]) denotes the subring of K
generated by F and u1, . . . , un (or S), and F(u1, . . . , un) (or F(S)) denotes its ﬁeld of
quotients.
Theorem 2.6.3. [Classiﬁcation of Elements in an Extension Field] Let K be a ﬁeld extension of
a ﬁeld F and let u ∈K. Then EITHER
(a) [F(u) : F] = ∞and F[u] ∼= F[t], so F(u) ∼= F(t) where t is an indeterminate OR
(b) [F(u) : F] is ﬁnite and F[u] = F(u).
Proof. Let t be an indeterminate and consider the ring homomorphism
F[t]
ϕ→K
deﬁned by ϕ(t) = u (or ϕ(f(t)) = f(u)). Note that the kernel of ϕ is a prime ideal, since the
image of ϕ has no zero divisors. There are two possibilities.
(1) ker ϕ = {0}. Then we have (a).
(2) ker ϕ ̸= {0}. Then ker ϕ = F[t]g(t) where g(t) is a monic prime (i.e., irreducible) polynomial.
Since F[t] is a PID, F[t]g(t) is a maximal ideal. Thus,
F[u] ∼= F[t]/F[t]g(t)
is a ﬁeld, so F[u] = F(u).

2. Rings and Fields
Remarks.
1. If g(t) = g0 + g1t + · · · + gn−1tn−1 + tn, then [F(u) : F] = n and {1, u, . . . , un−1}
is a basis for F(u) over F.
2. Consider R ⊂C and g(t) = g0 + g1t + t2 ∈R[t]. We distinguish three cases.
(a) If g2
1 −4g0 > 0, then g(t) = (t −a)(t −b) where a, b ∈R, a ̸= b and R[t]/R[t]g(t) is a
ring without nonzero nilpotent elements.
(b) If g2
1 −4g0 = 0, then g(t) = (t −a)2 and R[t]/R[t]g(t) is a ring with nonzero nilpotent
elements.
(c) If g2
1 −4g0 < 0, then R[t]/R[t]g(t) ∼= C.
3. If p is a prime, then t2 −p is irreducible over Q and the ﬁelds Q(√p) ∼= Q[t]/(t2 −p) are all
distinct.
Proof. Let p and q be distinct primes. Assume that ϕ : Q[√p] →Q[√q] is an isomorphism. Then
ϕ(1) = 1, and so ϕ(r) = r for all r in Q. Let ϕ(√p) = a + b√q for some a, b ∈Q. Thus, p = ϕ(p) =
(ϕ(√p))2 = (a + b√q)2 = (a + bq) + 2ab√q. Since √q is not rational, ab = 0. However, if a = 0, then
p = bq which implies q | p. If b = 0, then ϕ(√p) = a = ϕ(a), so √p = a is rational. Hence, both cases
lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Q[√p] and Q[√q] are not isomorphic.
An element in an extension ﬁeld can be classiﬁed according to Theorem 2.6.3 as follows.
Let K be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F. An element u ∈K is algebraic over F in case there
exists a nonzero polynomial f(t) ∈F[t] such that f(u) = 0 and transcendental element over F
otherwise.
For example, every complex number is algebraic over R;
3√
2 and 1 +
√
5 ∈R are algebraic
over Q. It has been proved that e and π ∈R are transcendental over Q (by the Lindemann-
Weierstrass theorem). We show the existence of real numbers transcendental over Q in Corollary
5.2.3. Moreover, most of real numbers are in fact transcendental over Q (see Exercises 2.6).
Theorem 2.6.3 yields characterizations of algebraic and transcendental elements.
Corollary 2.6.4. Let K be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and u ∈K. The following conditions
on u are equivalent:
(i) u is transcendental over F (if f(t) ∈F[t] and f(u) = 0, then f = 0);
(ii) F(u) ∼= F(t);
(iii) [F(u) : F] is inﬁnite.
Corollary 2.6.5. Let K be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and u ∈K. The following conditions
on u are equivalent:
(i) u is algebraic over F (there exists a polynomial 0 ̸= f(t) ∈F[t] such that f(u) = 0);
(ii) there exists a monic irreducible polynomial g(t) ∈F[t] such that g(u) = 0;
(iii) [F(u) : F] is ﬁnite.
Moreover, in part (ii), we have g(t) is unique; f(u) = 0 if and only if g(t) | f(t); F(u) ∼=
F[t]/(g(t)); and [F(u) : F] = deg g(t).
When u is algebraic over F, the unique monic irreducible polynomial g(t) ∈F[t] in part (ii) is
the minimal polynomial of u. The degree of u over F is deg g(t).
An extension ﬁeld K of a ﬁeld F is algebraic in case every element of K is algebraic over F.
For example, C is an algebraic extension of R, but R is not algebraic over Q. Note that if [K : F]
is ﬁnite, then K is an algebraic extension because [F(u) : F] ≤[K : F] < ∞for all u ∈K. An
extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is said to be a simple extension of F if E = F(α) for some α ∈E.

2.6. Field Extensions
77
Theorem 2.6.6. If L is an algebraic extension of K and K is an algebraic extension of F, then L
is algebraic extension over F.
Proof. Let u ∈L. Since L is algebraic over K, there exists f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈
K[x] such that f(u) = 0. Since K is algebraic over F, a0, a1, . . . , an are algebraic over F, so
[F(a0, a1, . . . , an) : F] is ﬁnite. For, let E = F(a0, a1, . . . , an). Then
[E : F] = [F(a0) : F]
n
Y
i=1
[F(a0, a1, . . . , ai) : F(a0, a1, . . . , ai−1)],
a0 is algebraic over F and ai is algebraic over F(a0, . . . , ai−1) for all i ∈{1, . . . , n}. Since f(x) ∈
E[x], u is algebraic over E, so [E(u) : E] is ﬁnite by Corollary 2.6.5. Thus,
[F(u) : F] ≤[E(u) : F] = [E(u) : E][E : F] < ∞.
Hence, u is algebraic over F.
Corollary 2.6.7. For a, b ∈K, if a and b are algebraic over F of degree m and n, respectively, then
a ± b, ab and a/b (if b ̸= 0) are all algebraic over F of degree ≤mn. Hence, the set of all algebraic
elements of K over F is a subﬁeld of K and is an algebraic extension over F.
Proof. By Corollary 2.6.5, [F(a) : F] = m and [F(b) : F] = n. Since b is algebraic over F, b is
algebraic over F(a), so [F(a)(b) : F(a)] ≤n. Thus, by Theorem 2.6.2, [F(a, b) : F] = [F(a)(b) :
F] = [F(a)(b) : F(a)][F(a) : F] ≤mn. Since a ± b, ab, ab−1 (if b ̸= 0) are in F(a, b) which is a
ﬁnite extension, they are all algebraic over F of degree ≤mn.
Example 2.6.3. Consider Q ⊂C. Let A = {z ∈C : z is algebraic over Q}. By Corollary 2.6.7, A
is algebraic over Q. Assume that [A : Q] = n is ﬁnite. Let f(x) = xn+1 −3. It is irreducible over Q
by Eisenstien’s criterion. Let α ∈C be such that f(α) = 0. Then α ∈A ans so Q ⊂Q[α] ⊂A. But
[Q[α] : Q] = n + 1 > [A : Q], which is a contradiction. Hence, [A : Q] is inﬁnite. This provides an
example of inﬁnite algebraic ﬁeld extensions.
2.6.2
More on Roots of Polynomials
We conclude this chapter by working more on roots of polynomials. The theorem of Kronecker
assures us that we may obtain an extension ﬁeld of F in which the polynomial p(x) ∈F[x] has a
root.
Theorem 2.6.8. If F is a ﬁeld and G is a ﬁnite subgroup of the multiplicative group of nonzero
elements of F, then G is a cyclic group. In particular, the multiplicative group of all nonzero
elements of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic.
Proof. If G = {1}, then G is cyclic. Assume that G ̸= {1}. Since G is a ﬁnite abelian group,
G ∼= Z/(m1) ⊕· · · ⊕Z/(mk)
where k ≥1, m1 > 1 and m1 | · · · | mk. Since mk
k
X
i=1
Z/(mi) = 0, u is a root of the polynomial
xmk −1 ∈F[x] for all u ∈G. By Corollary 2.5.6, this polynomial has at most mk distinct roots
in F, so |G| ≤mk. Hence, we must have k = 1 and G ∼= Z/(m1) which is a cyclic group.

78
2. Rings and Fields
Remark. The ﬁnite multiplicative subgroup of a division ring may not be cyclic. E.g., Q8 =
{±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} is a subgroup of the ring of real quaternions H and Q8 is not cyclic.
Let R be an integral domain and f(x) ∈R[x]. If α is a root of f(x), then there exist m ∈N
and g(x) ∈R[x] such that f(x) = (x −α)mg(x) and g(α) ̸= 0. m is called the multiplicity of the
root α of f(x) and if m > 1, α is called a multiple root of f(x).
If f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈R[x], we deﬁne f′(x) ∈R[x], the derivative of f(x), to be
the polynomial
f′(x) = a1 + a2x + · · · + nanxn−1.
We record the immediate properties of the derivative of polynomials in the next lemma
Lemma 2.6.9. If f(x) and g(x) are polynomials over an integral domain R and c ∈R, then
1. (cf(x))′ = cf′(x),
2. (f(x) + g(x))′ = f′(x) + g′(x),
3. (f(x)g(x))′ = f(x)g′(x) + f′(x)g(x),
4. ((f(x))n)′ = n(f(x))n−1f′(x) where n ∈N.
Characterizations of polynomials with multiple roots using derivatives are as follows.
Theorem 2.6.10. Let E be an extension of a ﬁeld F and f(x) ∈F[x].
1. For α ∈E, α is a multiple root of f(x) if and only if α is a root of both f(x) and f′(x).
2. If f(x) and f′(x) are relatively prime, then f(x) has no multiple root.
3. If f(x) is irreducible over F having a root in E, then
f(x) has no multiple root in E if and only if f′(x) ̸= 0.
Proof. (1) is clear.
(2) Since f(x) and f′(x) are relatively prime, there exist h(x) and k(x) in F[x] such that 1 =
f(x)h(x) + f′(x)k(x). If α ∈E is a multiple root of f(x), by (1), f(α) = 0 = f′(α), so 1 = 0, a
contradiction.
(3) Since f(x) is irreducible, f′(x) ̸= 0 and deg f′(x) < deg f(x), we have f(x) and f′(x) are
relatively prime, so f(x) has no multiple roots. Conversely, if f′(x) = 0, then f(α) = 0 = f′(α)
for some α ∈E since f(x) has a root in E. Hence, by (1), α is a multiple root of f(x).
Theorem 2.6.11. [Number of Roots] If f(x) ∈F[x] and deg f(x) = n > 1, then f(x) can have
at most n roots counting multiplicities in any extension ﬁeld of F.
Proof. We shall prove the theorem by induction on the degree of f(x). If deg f(x) = 1, then
f(x) = ax + b for some a, b ∈F and a ̸= 0. Then −b/a is the unique root of f(x) and −b/a ∈F,
so we are done.
Let deg f(x) = n > 1 and assume that the result is true for all polynomials of degree < n. Let
E be an extension ﬁeld of F. If f(x) has no roots in E, then we are done. Let r ∈E be a root
of f(x) of multiplicity m ≥1. Then there exists q(x) ∈E[x] such that f(x) = (x −r)mq(x) and
q(r) ̸= 0. Then deg q(x) = n −m. By the inductive hypothesis q(x) has at most n −m roots in E
counting multiplicities. Hence, f(x) has at most m+(n−m) roots in E counting multiplicities.
Theorem 2.6.12. [Kronocker] If p(t) ∈F[t] is irreducible in F[t], then there exists an extension
ﬁeld E of F such that [E : F] = deg p(t) and p(t) has a root in E.
Proof. We use the discussion at the beginning of the section to prove this theorem. Let E =
F[x]/(p(x)) where x is an indeterminate. Since p(x) is irreducible, E is a ﬁeld containing {a +
(p(x)) : a ∈F} as a subﬁeld. But F ∼= {a + (p(x)) : a ∈F} by ϕ : a 7→a + (p(x)), so E
can be considered as an extension ﬁeld of F by considering a as a + (p(x)) for all a ∈F. Then
E = F[x]/(p(x)) = F(¯t) where ¯t = x + (p(x)) is a root of p(t). Since E = F(¯t) and p(t) is
irreducible over F, [E : F] = [F(¯t) : F] = deg p(t) by Corollary 2.6.5.

2.6. Field Extensions
79
Corollary 2.6.13. If p(t) ∈F[t] is a nonconstant polynomial, then there exists a ﬁnite extension
ﬁeld E of F containing a root of p(t) and [E : F] ≤deg p(t).
Proof. Since F[t] is a UFD, p(t) has an irreducible factor in F[t], say p1(t). By Theorem 2.6.12,
there exists an extension ﬁeld E of F such that E contains a root of p1(t) and [E : F] = deg p1(t).
Hence, [E : F] ≤deg p(t) and E contains a root of p(t).

articles. Unfortunately, they did not have the formula for the exponent explicitly. Let q be a prime

Advanced Group Theory
Deeper results of groups are presented in this chapter. Various kinds of series of a group are
studied in the ﬁrst three sections. A solvable group gets its name from the Galois group of a
polynomial p(x) and solvability by radicals of the equation p(x) = 0. A nilpotent group can be
considered as a generalization of an abelian group. A linear group gives an example of an inﬁnite
simple group. Finally, we discuss how to construct a group from a set of objects and presentations.
3.1
Jordan-Hölder Theorem
The ideas of normal series of a group and solvability that arose in Galois theory yield invariants of
groups (the Jordan-Höder theorem), showing that simple groups are, in a certain sense, building
towers of ﬁnite groups.
A subnormal series of a group G is a ﬁnite sequence H0, H1, . . . , Hn of subgroups of G such
that Hi ⊳Hi+1 (although not necessarily normal in G) for all i with H0 = {e} and Hn = G. The
groups Hi+1/Hi are called the factors associated with the series. A subnormal series is called a
normal series of G if Hi ⊳G for all i.
Examples 3.1.1.
1. {0} < 8Z < 4Z < Z and {0} < 9Z < Z are normal series of Z.
2. {(1)} < A3 < S3 is a normal series of S3.
3. {(1)} < A4 < S4, {(1)} < V4 < S4 and {(1)} < V4 < A4 < S4 are normal series of S4. Here
V4 = {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.
4. {(1)} < {(1), (12)(34)} < V4 < A4 < S4 is a subnormal series of S4 which is not a normal
series.
A subnormal [normal] series {Kj} is a reﬁnement of a subnormal [normal] series {Hi} of a
group G if {Hi} ⊆{Kj}.
Example 3.1.2. The series {0} < 72Z < 9Z < 3Z < Z is a reﬁnement of the series {0} < 9Z < Z.
Two subnormal [normal] series {Hi} and {Kj} of the same group G are isomorphic if there is
a one-to-one correspondence between the collections of factor groups {Hi+1/Hi} and {Kj+1/Kj}
such that corresponding factor groups are isomorphic. Clearly, two isomorphic subnormal [nor-
mal] series must have the same number of groups.
Example 3.1.3. The two series of Z15, {0} < ⟨5⟩< Z15 and {0} < ⟨3⟩< Z15 are isomorphic.
The following theorem is fundamental to the theory of series.
Theorem 3.1.1. [Schreier] Two subnormal [normal] series of a group G have isomorphic reﬁne-
ments.
Example 3.1.4. Find isomorphic reﬁnements of the normal series
{0} < 8Z < 4Z < Z and {0} < 9Z < Z.
81

82
3. Advanced Group Theory
Consider the reﬁnement
{0} < 72Z < 8Z < 4Z < Z
of {0} < 8Z < 4Z < Z and the reﬁnement
{0} < 72Z < 18Z < 9Z < Z
of {0} < 9Z < Z. In both cases the reﬁnements have four factor groups isomorphic to Z4, Z2, Z9,
and 72Z or Z. The order in which the factor groups occurs is different to be sure.
Recall the following fact.
Theorem 3.1.2. If N is a normal subgroup of G, and if H is any subgroup of G, then HN = NH
is a subgroup of G. Furthermore, if H ⊳G, then HN ⊳G.
To prove Schreier’s theorem, we shall need the following lemma developed by Zassenhaus.
This lemma is also called the butterﬂy lemma since the diagram which accompanies the lemma
has a butterﬂy shape.
Lemma 3.1.3. [Zassenhaus] Let H and K be subgroups of a group G and let H∗and K∗be
normal subgroups of H and K respectively. Then
1. H∗(H ∩K∗) is a normal subgroup of H∗(H ∩K).
2. K∗(H∗∩K) is a normal subgroup of K∗(H ∩K).
3. H∗(H ∩K)/H∗(H ∩K∗) ∼= K∗(H ∩K)/K∗(H∗∩K) ∼= (H ∩K)/[(H∗∩K)(H ∩K∗)].

Proof. We ﬁrst note that
H∗(H ∩K), H∗(H ∩K∗), K∗(H ∩K) and K∗(H∗∩K)
are groups. It is easy to show that H∗∩K are H ∩K∗are normal subgroups of H ∩K. Apply
Theorem 3.1.2 to H∗∩K and H∩K∗as normal subgroups of H∩K, we have L = (H∗∩K)(H∩K∗)
is a normal subgroup of H ∩K. Thus we have the lattice of subgroups shown above.
Let φ : H∗(H ∩K) →(H ∩K)/L be deﬁned as follows. For h ∈H∗and x ∈H ∩K, let
φ(hx) = xL. We show φ is well deﬁned and a homomorphism. Let h1, h2 ∈H∗and x1, x2 ∈H∩K.

3.1. Jordan-Hölder Theorem
83
If h1x1 = h2x2, then h−1
2 h1 = x2x−1
1
∈H∗∩(H ∩K) = H∗∩K ⊆L, so x1L = x2L. Thus φ is
well deﬁned. Since H∗is normal in H, there is h3 in H∗such that x1h2 = h3x1. Then
φ((h1x1)(h2x2)) = φ((h1h3)(x1x2)) = (x1x2)L
= (x1L)(x2L) = φ(h1x1)φ(h2x2)
Thus, φ is a homomorphism.
Obviously φ is onto (H ∩K)/L. Finally if h ∈H∗and x ∈H ∩K, then φ(hx) = xL = L if
and only if x ∈L, or if and only if hx ∈H∗L = H∗(H∗∩K)(H ∩K∗) = H∗(H ∩K∗). Hence,
ker φ = H∗(H ∩K∗). Another similar result follows by symmetry.
Proof of Schreier’s theorem. Let G be a group and let
{e} = H0 < H1 < H2 < · · · < Hn = G
and
{e} = K0 < K1 < K2 < · · · < Km = G
be two subnormal series for G. For i where 0 ≤i ≤n −1, we form the chain of (not necessarily
distinct) groups
Hi = Hi(Hi+1 ∩K0) ≤Hi(Hi+1 ∩K1) ≤· · · ≤Hi(Hi+1 ∩Km) = Hi+1.
We reﬁne the ﬁrst subnormal series by inserting the above chain between Hi and Hi+1. In a
symmetric fashion, for 0 ≤j ≤m −1, we insert the chain
Kj = Kj(Kj+1 ∩H0) ≤Kj(Kj+1 ∩H1) ≤· · · ≤Kj(Kj+1 ∩Hn) = Kj+1
between Kj and Kj+1. Thus we get two reﬁnement having mn terms. By Zassenhaus’s Lemma,
we have
Hi(Hi+1 ∩Kj+1)/Hi(Hi+1 ∩Kj) ∼= Kj(Kj+1 ∩Hi+1)/Kj(Kj+1 ∩Hi)
for 0 ≤i ≤n −1 and 0 ≤j ≤m −1. Hence, this two reﬁnements are isomorphic.
For normal series, where all Hi and Kj are normal in G, we merely observe that all the groups
Hi(Hi+1 ∩Kj) and Kj(Kj+1 ∩Hi) are normal in G, so the same proof applies.
A normal subgroup M(̸= G) is called a maximal normal subgroup of G if there exists no
normal subgroup N, other than G or M, such that M ⊳N ⊳G. Recall that a group G is simple if
G and {e} are the only normal subgroups of G. For example, Zp, p a prime, and An, n ̸= 4, are
simple. We also have an obvious fact.
Theorem 3.1.4. G is a simple abelian group if and only if G is cyclic of prime order.
The next criterion follows directly from the third isomorphism theorem (Theorem 1.4.4).
Theorem 3.1.5. M is a maximal normal subgroup of a group G if and only if G/M is simple.
A subnormal series {Hi} of a group G is a composition series if all the factor groups Hi+1/Hi
are simple. A normal series {Hi} of G is a principal or chief series if all the factor groups
Hi+1/Hi are simple.
Observe that by Theorem 3.1.5 Hi+1/Hi is simple if and only if Hi is a maximal normal
subgroup of Hi+1. Thus for a composition series, each Hi must be a maximal normal subgroup of
Hi+1. To form a composition series of a group G, we just look for a maximal normal subgroup Hn−1
of G, then for a maximal normal subgroup of Hn−1, and so on. If this process terminates in ﬁnite
number of steps, we have a composition series. Hence, we have ﬁrst shown:

84
3. Advanced Group Theory
Theorem 3.1.6. If G is a ﬁnite group, then G has a composition series.
Note that by Theorem 3.1.5 a composition series cannot have any further reﬁnement. To form
a principal series, we have to hunt for a maximal normal subgroup Hn−1 of G, then for a maximal
normal subgroup of Hn−1 that is also normal in G, and so on. The main theorem is as follows.
Theorem 3.1.7. [Jordan-Hölder] Any two composition [principal] series of a group G are iso-
morphic.
Proof. Let {Hi} and {Ki} be two composition [principal] series of G. By Schreier’s theorem,
they have isomorphic reﬁnements. But since all factor groups are already simple, Theorem 3.1.5
shows that neither series has any further reﬁnement. Hence, {Hi} and {Ki} must already be
isomorphic.
Examples 3.1.5 (Examples of composition series).
1. If G is simple, then {e} ⊳G is the only
normal series of G. It is a composition series for G and its associated factor is G = G/{e}.
2. If n ̸= 4, then {(1)} < An < Sn is a composition series of Sn.
3. Z has many normal series. For example, let m1, . . . , mn be positive integers. Then
Z > m1Z > m1m2Z > · · · > m1m2 . . . mnZ > {0}
is a normal series for Z whose associated factors are Zm1, Zm2, . . . , Zmn, Z. Note that since
any nontrivial subgroup of Z is isomorphic to Z, any normal series for Z must have one
associated factor isomorphic to Z. Hence, Z has no composition series.
4. Let p be prime and G = Zp × Zp. If (x, y) ̸= (0, 0) in G, then ⟨(x, y)⟩∼= Zp and {(0, 0)} <
⟨(x, y)⟩< G is a composition series for G. The composition factors are G/⟨(x, y)⟩∼= Zp and
⟨(x, y)⟩/(0, 0) ∼= Zp, i.e., Zp with multiplicity 2. Note that G has (p2 −1)/(p −1) = p + 1
subgroups of order p, so G has p + 1 distinct composition series. But in all cases they have
the same composition factors: Zp with multiplicity 2.
5. Let p and q be prime and G = Zp × Zq = ⟨a⟩× ⟨b⟩. Then the only proper subgroup of G are
⟨a⟩= Zp and ⟨b⟩= Zq. Thus G has two composition series
{e} < ⟨a⟩< G and {e} < ⟨b⟩< G
In both cases, the associated composition factors are Zp and Zq both with multiplicity one.
6. Consider Zp3, Zp2 × Zp and Zp × Zp × Zp. In any composition series for these groups the
same composition factors, namely Zp with multiplicity 3, occur.
Exercises 3.1.
1. Suppose G has precisely two subgroups. Show that G has prime order.
2. A proper subgroup M of G is maximal if whenever M ⊆H ⊆G, we have H = M or H = G.
Suppose G is ﬁnite and has only one maximal subgroup. Show that |G| is a power of prime.
3. Let G = Z36. Consider two normal series {0} < ⟨12⟩< ⟨3⟩< Z36 and {0} < ⟨18⟩< Z36. Find two
isomorphic chains and exhibit the isomorphic factor groups as described in the proof of Schreier’s
Theorem.
4. Find a composition series for the dihedral group D4 = {σ, ρ : σ4 = ρ2 = e and ρσρ−1 = σ−1} and
for the quaternion group Q = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}. Determine the composition factor in each case.
5. Prove that if G has a composition [resp. principal] series and if N is a proper normal subgroup of G,
then there exists a composition [resp. principal] series containing N. Hence, show that N and G/N
have composition [principal] series.
6. Show that if H0 = {e} < H1 < H2 < · · · < Hn = G is a subnormal [normal] series of G, and if
Hi+1/Hi is of ﬁnite order si+1, then G is of ﬁnite order s1s2 . . . sn.
7. Show that an inﬁnite abelian group can have no composition series.

3.2
Solvable Groups
Let G be a group. For g, h ∈G, [g, h] = ghg−1h−1 is called a commutator of G. The derived
subgroup of G, denoted by G′, is the group generated by all commutators of elements of G, i.e.,
G′ = ⟨ghg−1h−1 : g, h ∈G⟩.
The n-th derived subgroup of G, denoted by G(n) is deﬁned inductively by G(0) = G and G(n) =
(G(n−1))′ for all n ≥1.
Theorem 3.2.1. Let G be a group.
1. If N is a subgroup, then (N is normal and G/N is abelian) if and only if G′ ⊆N.
2. G′ is a normal subgroup of G and G/G′ is abelian.
3. Every homomorphism θ : G →A, where A is an abelian group, factors through G/G′. More
precisely, there is a map ¯θ : G/G′ →A such that θ = ¯θ ◦π, where π : G →G/G′ is the
canonical projection.
Proof. (1) Assume that N is normal and G/N is abelian. Let x, y ∈G. Then xyN = yxN, so
xyx−1y−1 ∈N. Thus G′ ⊆N. Conversely, suppose that G′ ⊆N. Let x, y ∈G and n ∈N. Then
xnx−1n−1 ∈G′ ⊆N which implies that xnx−1 ∈Nn = N. Hence, N ⊳G. Since (xy)(yx)−1 =
xyx−1y−1 ∈G′ ⊆N, xyN = yxN, so G/N is abelian.
(2) follows from 1 by taking N = G′.
(3) Deﬁne ¯θ(xG′) = θ(x) for all x ∈G. Clearly, θ = ¯θ ◦π and is a homomorphism. Since
θ(G′) = {e}, ¯θ is well deﬁned.
Remark. The quotient G/G′ is the largest abelian homomorphic image of G.
The derived series of a group G is the sequence of groups
G = G(0) ≥G(1) ≥G(2) ≥· · · ≥G(n) ≥. . . .
A group G is said to be solvable (of derived length ≤n) if G(n) = {e} for some n. A solvable
group arises from the study of the Galois group of a polynomial in order to obtain a criterion to
determine if it is solvable by radicals. We shall see this in Section 5.7.
A subgroup H of a group G which is invariant under all automorphisms, that is, ϕ(H) ≤H
for all ϕ ∈Aut G, is called a characteristic subgroup of G. Using the inner automorphisms
ϕa(x) = axa−1 for all a ∈G, we deduce that every characteristic subgroup is normal in G.
Lemma 3.2.2. Let ϕ : G →H be a surjective homomorphism. Then ϕ(G(i)) = H(i) for every
i ≥0. Also, G(i) is a characteristic subgroup for all i, and is thus normal in G.
Proof. We have ϕ([x, y]) = [ϕ(x), ϕ(y)], and since ϕ is onto, we see that ϕ maps the set of commu-
tators in G onto those in H. It follows that ϕ(G′) = H′, and repeated application of this argument
yields that ϕ(G(i)) = H(i), as required. That the terms of the derived series of G are characteristic
follows from the ﬁrst part of the lemma when we take H = G and ϕ ∈Aut G.
Theorem 3.2.3. Let G be a group. Then G is solvable if and only if G has a subnormal series with
abelian factors.
Proof. If G is solvable, G = G(0) > G(1) > · · · > G(n) = {e} is a subnormal series with abelian
factors. Conversely, suppose G = G0 > G1 > · · · > Gm = {e} is a subnormal series for G with
abelian factors. Since Gi/Gi+1 is abelian, Gi+1 ≥G′
i. We claim Gi ≥G(i) for i = 0, 1, . . . , m by
induction on i. For i = 0, G0 = G = G(0). Assume Gi ≥G(i). Then Gi+1 ≥G′
i ≥(G(i))′ = G(i+1),
which completes the induction. Hence, {e} = Gm ≥G(m), so G(m) = 1 and G is solvable.

86
3. Advanced Group Theory
Remark. From Lemma 3.2.2, we know that G(i) ⊳G for all i. Then the above derived series
G = G(0) > G(1) > · · · > G(n) = {e}
is indeed a normal series with abelian factors for G. Also, if G is solvable, its derived length,
dl(G), is the smallest positive integer n such that G(n) = {e}.
Examples 3.2.1 (Examples of solvable groups).
1. An abelian group G is solvable of derived
length 1 because G′ = {e}. In addition, the groups with derived length 1 are exactly the
abelian groups. Hence, a group G is abelian if and only if G is solvable of derived length 1.
2. Let Dn be the dihedral group of order 2n, i.e.,
Dn = {σ, ρ : σn = ρ2 = e and ρσρ−1 = σ−1}.
Here, σ is the 2π/n rotation and ρ is the reﬂection of the regular n-gon. For example,
D1 = Z2, D2 = Z2 × Z2 and D3 = S3. Then D′
n = ⟨σ2⟩, an abelian group. Thus, D(2)
n
= {e}.
For n = 1 or 2, Dn is abelian and hence has derived length one. For n ≥3, Dn is solvable of
derived length two.
Proof. Observe that Dn = {e, σ, σ2, . . . , σn−1, ρ, ρσ, ρσ2, . . . , ρσn−1}. For x, y ∈Dn, we distinguish
four cases
xyx−1y−1 =










σkσlσ−kσ−l = e
(ρσk)(ρσl)(σ−kρ−1)(σ−lρ−1) = ρσkσkσ−lσ−lρ−1 = σ−2kσ2l
(ρσk)σl(σ−kρ−1)σ−l = σ−lσ−l = σ−2l
σk(ρσl)σ−k(σ−lρ−1) = σkσk = σ2k.
This implies that D′
n ⊆⟨σ2⟩. On the other hand, we have σ2 = ρσ−1ρ−1σ. Thus, D′
n = ⟨σ2⟩.
3. The groups S1 = {(1)} and S2 = Z2 are abelian groups. The group S3 = D3 is solvable of
derived length two. Since S′
4 = A4, A′
4 = V4 and V ′
4 = {(1)} = S(3)
4 , we can conclude that
the group S4 is solvable of derived length 3. For n ≥5, S′
n = An and A′
n = S(2)
n
= An since
An is simple and non-abelian. Therefore Sn ≥An ≥An ≥. . . is the derived series of Sn
and Sn is not solvable for n ≥5. These facts are important in Galois theory (Section 5.7)
and relate to the famous formula for the solution of quadratic, cubic and quartic equations
(by using square roots, cube roots, etc.), and the historic proof by Abel in 1824 that there
are no such formula for the quintic equation.
Proof. It is easy to see that any group of order two in A4 are not normal. Since A4 has more than one
Sylow 3-subgroup, any subgroups of A4 of order three are not normal. Moreover, A4 has no subgroup
of order six (see Exercises 1.5). Hence, the normal subgroups of A4 are A4, V4 and {(1)}. Note that
S′
4 is a subgroup of A4. Moreover, it is normal in A4. Since S4 and S4/V4 are not abelian, S′
4 must
be A4. Since A4 is not abelian and A4/V4 is abelian, we have A′
4 = V4. Hence, S4 ⊲A4 ⊲V4 ⊲{(1)} is
the derived series of S4. Next, let n ≥5 and K = S′
n ⊳Sn. Then K ∩An ⊳Sn, so K ∩An ⊳An. Since
An is simple, K ∩An = {(1)} or K ∩An = An. But K ⊆An and K ̸= {(1)} (since Sn is non-abelian),
we get K = An. Hence, S′
n = An.
The following theorem is often useful to decide if a group is solvable.
Theorem 3.2.4.
1. If G is solvable and H is a subgroup of G, then H is solvable.
2. If G is solvable and N is a normal subgroup G, then G/N is solvable.
3. A homomorphic image of a solvable group is solvable.
4. If N ⊳G and N and G/N are solvable, then G is solvable and dl(G) ≤dl(N) + dl(G/N).
5. If G and H are solvable, then G × H is solvable.

3.3. Nilpotent Groups
87
Proof. (1) Since H(i) ≤G(i) for all i, H(n) = {e} if G(n) = {e}.
(2) The application of Lemma 3.2.2 to the canonical homomorphism π : G →G/N yields that
(G/N)(i) = π(G(i)) for all i, and hence if G(n) = {e}, we have (G/N)(n) = {N}.
(3) follows from (2).
(4) Let dl(N) = n and dl(G/N) = m. Since the canonical homomorphism ϕ : G →G/N maps
G(m) to (G/N)(m) = {N}, we see that G(m) ⊆N. Thus G(m+n) = (G(m))(n) ⊆N(n) = {e}, and
hence G is solvable.
(5) follows from (4).
Some additional conditions under which ﬁnite groups are solvable are as follows.
Theorem 3.2.5. Let G be a ﬁnite group.
1. [Burnside] If |G| = paqb for some primes p and q, then G is solvable.
2. [Philip Hall] If for every prime p dividing |G| we factor the order of G as |G| = pam where
(p, m) = 1, and G has a subgroup of order m, then G is solvable, i.e., if for all primes p, G
has a subgroup whose index equals the order of a Sylow p-subgroup, then G is solvable—such
subgroups are called Sylow p-complements.
3. [Feit-Thompson] If G is odd, then G is solvable.
4. [Thompson] If for every pair of elements x, y ∈G, ⟨x, y⟩is a solvable groups, then G is
solvable.
Burnside’s and Philip Hall’s Theorems were proved by using Character Theory. The proof of
the Feit-Thompson Theorem takes 255 pages of hard mathematics (Solvability of groups of odd
order, Paciﬁc Journal of Mathematics, 13 (1963), pp. 775–1029). Thompson’s Theorem was ﬁrst
proved as a consequence of 475-page paper (that in turn relies ultimately on the Feit-Thompson
Theorem).
Exercises 3.2.
1. (a) Give an example of a normal subgroup of G which is not characteristic.
(b) Prove that Z(G) is a characteristic subgroup of G.
(c) If H is a characteristic subgroup of N and N ⊳G, show that H ⊳G.
2. Show that if G is a solvable simple group, then G is abelian.
3. Let {e} = H0 < H1 < H2 < · · · < Hn−1 < Hn = G be a composition for G. Prove that G is solvable
if and only if the composition factors Hi+1/Hi all have prime order. Deduce that if G is solvable with
a composition series, then G is ﬁnite.
4. Find a composition series of S3 × S3. Is S3 × S3 solvable?
5. Show that a group of order 1995 is solvable.

that both of them are solvable. [Hint. G1 has a unique subgroup of order q.]
7. Let G be a group of order 495 = 32 · 5 · 11.

(b) Let P be a Sylow 5-subgroup and Q a Sylow 11-subgroup of G. Prove that PQ is normal in G.
(c) Prove that G is solvable.

(i) every group of odd order is solvable
(ii) the only simple groups of odd order are those of prime order.
3.3
Nilpotent Groups
In this section, we shall introduce a class of groups whose structure, next to those of abelian
groups, is most amenable to analysis. We begin by generalizing the notion of a commutator.

88
3. Advanced Group Theory
If A and B are subsets of G, [A, B] is the subgroup of G generated by all commutators [a, b] =
aba−1b−1 where a ∈A and b ∈B, that is,
[A, B] = ⟨[a, b] : a ∈A and b ∈B⟩.
Note that [A, B] = [B, A].
Example 3.3.1. G′ = [G, G], G(2) = [G′, G′], . . . , G(n+1) = [G(n), G(n)].
The lower central series of a group G is deﬁned inductively by Γ1(G) = G and Γn+1(G) =
[G, Γn(G)] for all n ≥1, so we get
G = Γ1(G) ≥Γ2(G) ≥. . .
and Γn(G) is called the n-th term of the lower central series of G.
A group G is said to be nilpotent of class ≤n if Γn+1 = {e}.
Remarks.
1. Since Γ2(G) = [G, G] = G′, G is abelian if and only if G is nilpotent of class ≤1.
2. Note that the derived series commences
G = G(0) ≥G(1) ≥. . .
while the lower central series commences
G = Γ1(G) ≥Γ2(G) ≥. . . .
Note however that G is abelian if and only if {e} = [G, G] = G′ = Γ2(G), so
G is abelian ⇔G is solvable of length ≤1 ⇔G is nilpotent of class ≤1.
Examples 3.3.2 (Examples of nilpotent groups).
1. S3 has the derived series S3 > A3 > {(1)}
and has the lower central series S3 > A3 ≥A3 ≥. . . , so S3 is solvable (of length 2) but not
nilpotent.
2. S4 has the derived series S4 > A4 > V4 > {(1)} and has the lower central series S4 > A4 ≥
A4 ≥. . . , so S4 is solvable (of length 3) but not nilpotent.
3. Dn = ⟨ρ, τ : ρn = τ 2 = e and τρτ −1 = ρ−1⟩has the derived series Dn > ⟨ρ2⟩> {e} and has
a lower central series Dn ≥⟨ρ2⟩≥⟨ρ4⟩≥⟨ρ8⟩≥. . . . Hence, Dn is solvable (of length 2)
unless D1 or D2 which is abelian. But Dn is nilpotent if and only if ρ2r = e for some r if and
only if n is a power of 2.
Theorem 3.3.1. Let G be a group. Then Γn+1(G) ≥G(n) for all n ≥0. Hence, a nilpotent group
is solvable. Therefore, Sn is not nilpotent for all n ≥5.
Proof. We shall use induction on n. For n = 0, Γ1(G) = G = G(0). For the inductive step, we
suppose Γn+1(G) ≥G(n). Thus
Γn+2(G) = [G, Γn+1(G)] ≥[G(n), G(n)] = G(n+1).
Finally, assume that G is nilpotent. Then Γn+1(G) = {e} for some n, so G(n) = {e}. Hence, G is
solvable.
Remark. In fact, we have Γ1(G) ≥G(0), Γ2(G) ≥G(1), Γ4(G) ≥G(2), Γ8(G) ≥G(3), . . . ,
Γ2n(G) ≥G(n), . . . but this is more difﬁcult to prove.

3.3. Nilpotent Groups
89
Recall that if N is a normal subgroup of G, then H ↔H/N gives a 1-1 correspondence
between subgroups of G containing N and subgroups of G/N. Moreover, this correspondence
carries normal subgroups to normal subgroups.
Now let Z(G) denote the center of a group G. Then Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G and
Z(G/Z(G)) is a normal subgroup of G/Z(G). Hence,
Z(G/Z(G)) = Z2(G)/Z(G)
where Z2(G) is a normal subgroup of G containing Z(G). We generalize this construction to make
the following deﬁnition.
The upper central series of a group G is deﬁned inductively by Z0(G) = {e} and Zn+1(G)/Zn(G) =
Z(G/Zn(G)) for all n ≥1, so we get
{e} = Z0(G) ≤Z1(G) ≤Z2(G) ≤. . .
and Zn(G) is called the n-th term of the upper series of G.
Remarks.
1. Z1(G) is the center of G and Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) is the center of G/Zi(G).
2. Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) = Z(G/Zi(G)) is equivalent to Zi+1(G) = {g ∈G : [G, g] ≤Zi(G)} because
Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) =Z(G/Zi(G))
⇐⇒∀g ∈G, [g ∈Zi+1(G) ⇔∀x ∈G, gxZi(G) = xgZi(G)]
⇐⇒∀g ∈G, [g ∈Zi+1(G) ⇔∀x ∈G, xgx−1g−1 ∈Zi(G)]
⇐⇒∀g ∈G, [g ∈Zi+1(G) ⇔[G, g] ⊆Zi(G)]
⇐⇒Zi+1(G) = {g ∈G : [G, g] ≤Zi(G)}.
3. We can show by induction that Zi(G) is a characteristic subgroup of G for all i ∈N.
A subnormal series G = G1 ≥G2 ≥. . . is called a central series for G if [G, Gi] ≤Gi+1 for
all i.
Remarks.
1. Since [G, Γi(G)] = Γi+1(G), the lower central series is a central series for G.
2. Note that the condition Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) = Z(G/Zi(G)) implies the inclusion [G, Zi+1(G)] ≤
Zi(G). Thus, if Zn(G) = G for some n, then the upper central series (in reverse order) is a
central series for G:
G = Zn(G) ≥Zn−1(G) ≥· · · ≥Z1(G) ≥Z0(G) = {e}.
Now, we wish to collect equivalence deﬁnitions of a nilpotent group in terms of lower central
series, upper central series and central series.
Theorem 3.3.2. Let G be a group.
1. If G = G1 ≥G2 ≥G3 ≥. . . is a central series for G, then Gn ≥Γn(G) for all n.
2. G has a central series G = G1 > G2 > · · · > Gn+1 = {e} if and only if G is nilpotent of
class ≤n.
Proof. (1) We shall use induction on n. For n = 1, G1 = G = Γ1(G). For the inductive step, we
suppose Gn ≥Γn(G). Then
Gn+1 ≥[G, Gn] ≥[G, Γn(G)] = Γn+1(G).
(2) If G = G1 ≤G2 ≤. . . ≤Gn+1 = {e} is a central series for G, then {e} = Gn+1 ≥Γn+1(G),
so G is nilpotent of class ≤n. Conversely, if G is nilpotent of class ≤n, then G = Γ1(G) ≥. . . ≥
Γn+1(G) = {e} is a central series of the required length.

3. Advanced Group Theory
Theorem 3.3.3. Let G be a group.
1. Suppose G = G1 ≥G2 ≥. . . ≥Gn+1 = {e} is a central series for G. Then Zk(G) ≥Gn−k+1
for all k ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}.
2. If Zn(G) = G, then G = Zn(G) ≥Zn−1(G) ≥. . . ≥Z1(G) ≥Z0(G) = {e} is a central
series for G.
3. G is nilpotent of class ≤n if and only if Zn(G) = G.
Proof. (1) We shall show that Zk(G) ≥Gn−k+1 by induction on k. For k = 0, Z0(G) = {e} =
Gn+1. Suppose Zk(G) ≥Gn−k+1. Let g ∈Gn−(k+1)+1 = Gn−k, then [G, g] ≤Gn−k+1 ≤Zk(G), so
g ∈Zk+1(G). Hence, Zk+1(G) ≥Gn−(k+1)+1.
(2) Since Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) = Z(G/Zi(G)), [G, Zi+1(G)] ≤Zi(G). Hence, the given series is a
central series.
(3) follows from (1) and (2) using Theorem 3.3.2.
Suppose that G is nilpotent of class ≤n and that G = G1 ≥G2 ≥. . . ≥Gn+1 = {e} is any

In other words, of all central series for G, the upper central series has the largest groups
and the lower central series has the smallest groups. We can restate some of the conclusions of
Theorems 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 as follows.
Theorem 3.3.4. Let G be a group. Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) G is nilpotent of class ≤n.
(ii) Γn+1(G) = {e}.
(iii) G has a central series G = G1 ≥G2 ≥. . . ≥Gn+1 = {e}.
(iv) Zn(G) = G.
Next, we shall see that a ﬁnite nilpotent group behaves like a ﬁnite abelian group. We show
that it is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. We recall Theorem 1.6.2.
Theorem 3.3.5. Let p be a prime. If G ̸= {e} is a ﬁnite p-group, then Z(G) ̸= {e}.
We can thus prove another important fact.
Theorem 3.3.6. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group. Then G is nilpotent, and hence G is solvable.
Proof. Consider the upper central series {e} = Z0(G) ≤Z1(G) ≤Z2(G) ≤Z3(G) ≤. . . . If
Zi(G) ̸= G, then G/Zi(G) is a p-group, so Zi+1(G)/Zi(G) = Z(G/Zi(G)) ̸= {Zi(G)}. That is,
Zi+1(G) ≩Zi(G). Since G is ﬁnite, the central series cannot increase for all i. Hence, Zn(G) = G
for some n, so G is nilpotent.
Theorem 3.3.7. Let G be a nilpotent group and let {e} < Z1(G) < · · · < Zn(G) = G be the
upper central series of G. Suppose H is a subgroup of G and deﬁne inductively N0(H) = H,
N1(H) = N(H) = {g ∈G : gHg−1 ⊆H}, the normalizer of H and Nk+1 = N(Nk(H)) for all
k ≥0. Then Nn(H) = G.

3.3. Nilpotent Groups

Proof. We shall prove by induction on i that Ni(H) ≥Zi(G). For i = 0, N0(H) = H ≥{e} =
Z0(G). Suppose Ni(H) ≥Zi(G). Let g ∈Zi+1(G). Then [g, G] ⊆Zi(G). To show that g ∈
N(Ni(H)), let x ∈Ni(H). Then gxg−1x−1 ∈Zi(G) ≤Ni(H), so gxg−1 ∈Ni(H)x = Ni(H).
Hence, g ∈Ni+1(H).
From the above theorem, we can deduce the following:
Theorem 3.3.8. Suppose G is nilpotent and H is a proper subgroup of G. Then N(H) ≩H.
Before we discuss the main characterization theorem, we study some auxiliary results.
Theorem 3.3.9.
1. If G is nilpotent and H is a subgroup of G, then H is nilpotent.
2. If G is nilpotent and N is a normal subgroup G, then G/N is nilpotent.
3. If G and H are nilpotent, then G × H is nilpotent.
Proof. (1) and (2) are analogous to the proofs of 3.2.4 for G is solvable.
(3) Suppose that G and H are nilpotent. Then there exist r, s > 0 so that Γr(G) = {eG} and
Γs(H) = {eH}. Thus Γk(G × H) = Γk(G) × Γk(H) = {(eG, eH)} where k = max{r, s}. Hence,
G × H is nilpotent.
Finally, we shall that a ﬁnite nilpotent group behaves like a ﬁnite abelian group as we have
seen in Theorem 1.7.12. This theorem characterizes all ﬁnite nilpotent groups.
Theorem 3.3.10. [Finite Nilpotent Groups] Let G be a ﬁnite group. Then the following statements
are equivalent.
(i) G is nilpotent.
(ii) All Sylow p-subgroups of G are normal in G.
(iii) G is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii). Assume that G is nilpotent. Recall Theorem 1.6.10 that if P is a Sylow p-
subgroup, then N(N(P)) = N(P). But Theorem 3.3.8 asserts that if H is a proper subgroup of
G, then N(H) ≩H. Thus we must have N(P) = G, that is, P is normal in G since P ⊳N(P).
(ii) ⇒(iii). Note that if a Sylow p-subgroup P of G is normal in G, then it is the unique Sylow
p-subgroup of G. Let p1, p2, . . . , pk be the distinct prime divisors of |G| and let Pi be the Sylow
pi-subgroup of G. Suppose x ∈Pi and y ∈Pj where i ̸= j. Then xyx−1y−1 ∈Pi ∩Pj = {e},
so x and y commute. It follows that φ : P1 × · · · × Pk →G deﬁned by φ(x1, . . . , xk) = x1 . . . xk
is a homomorphism. It is easy to show that φ is a bijection. Hence, G is the direct product of its
Sylow p-subgroups.
(iii) ⇒(i). A ﬁnite p-group is nilpotent (Theorem 3.3.6) and a ﬁnite direct product of nilpotent
groups is nilpotent (Theorem 3.3.9). Hence, if G is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups,
then G is nilpotent.
The next corollary is just a restatement of Theorem 1.7.12.
Corollary 3.3.11. A ﬁnite abelian group is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.

Linear Groups
In this section, we talk about linear groups over a ﬁeld. They have many interesting properties
and provide us an example of an inﬁnite simple group (Jordan-Moore’s theorem).
Let K be a ﬁeld and Mn(K) be the set of n × n matrices with entries in K. Then Mn(K) is
a ring. Let GLn(K) denote the set of multiplicatively invertible elements in Mn(K), called the
general linear group of degree n, that is,
GLn(K) = Mn(K)× = {A ∈Mn(K) : det(A) ̸= 0}.
Since det(AB) = det A det B, det : GLn(K) →K× is a homomorphism (of two groups). Its kernel
consists of determinant one matrices, denoted by SLn(K) and called the special linear group of
degree n. It is a normal subgroup of GLn(K) with quotient GLn(K)/SLn(K) isomorphic to
K× = K ∖{0}.
Geometrically, let V be a vector space over K of dimension n. Upon choosing a basis of V , we
can represent all linear transformations from V to V via n × n matrices with entries in K. Then
GLn(K) represents the invertible linear transformations on V , i.e., those which are one-to-one or
equivalently those which are onto.
Theorem 3.4.1. Let K be a ﬁeld. Then
Z(GLn(K)) = {λIn : λ ∈K×}
and
Z(SLn(K)) = {λIn : λ ∈K and λn = 1},
where In is the n × n identity matrix.
Proof. For M to be in the center of G = GLn(K), it must commute with every N in G. In
particular, M commutes with the elementary matrices. Recall that multiplying M on the left by
an elementary matrix corresponds to performing an elementary row operation; multiplying M on
the right by an elementary matrix corresponds to performing an elementary column operation.
Thus, multiplying the ith row of M by a nonzero a gives you the same matrix as multiplying the
ith column of M by a. This implies that the matrix is diagonal. Then, since interchanging the ith
and jth row of M gives us the same matrix as swapping the ith and jth column of M, the ith
entry along the diagonal must equal the jth entry along the diagonal, for all i and j. Therefore,

3.4. Linear Groups
93
M must be a multiple of In. Finally, it is easy to see that all nonzero multiples of In do commute
with all N ∈G. Hence, the theorem is proved for GLn(K).
For the center of SLn(K), we need to use the elementary matrices Xij(a), i ̸= j, whose entries
are the same as that of the identity matrix In except for an a ∈K in the (i, j) location. It is
obtained by performing the row operation Ri + aRj, i ̸= j or the column operation Cj + aCi
on In. Clearly, Xij(a) ∈SLn(K) for all a ∈K and i ̸= j.
If M is in the center of SLn(K), then M must commute with Xij(1) for all i ̸= j, so the ith
and jth columns and rows must be all zeros except for the (i, i) and (j, j) entries which must be
equal. Moreover, the product of the diagonal entries is the determinant which is equal to 1.
From the above theorem, the center of GLn(K) consists of scalar matrices λIn with λ ∈K×
and the center of SLn(K) consists of scalar matrices λIn with λ ∈K and λn = 1. They are normal
and lead to the next deﬁnitions.
The quotient group GLn(K)/Z(GLn(K)) = PGLn(K), called the projective linear group of
degree n. The quotient SLn(K)/Z(SLn(K)) = PSLn(K) is called the projective special linear
group of degree n.
If K is ﬁnite, we may determine the cardinality of each linear group as follows.
Theorem 3.4.2. If |K| = q < ∞, then
|GLn(K)| = (qn −1)(qn −q)(qn −q2) . . . (qn −qn−1).
Proof. Let A ∈GLn(K). Then the columns of A are linearly independent vectors in Kn. Thus
the ﬁrst column of A can be any nonzero vectors in Kn. The second column must not be multiple
of the ﬁrst column, and the jth column must not be a linear combination of the previous j −1
columns for all j = 2, . . . , n. By the product rule, we obtain the theorem.
Corollary 3.4.3. Let K be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements. Then
|SLn(K)| = |PGLn(K)| = (qn −1)(qn −q)(qn −q2) . . . (qn −qn−2)qn−1
and |PSL2(K)| = |SL2(K)| if charK = 2 and |PSL2(K)| = |SL2(K)|/2 if charK ̸= 2.
Proof. They follow from their deﬁnitions and Theorem 3.4.2.
Lemma 3.4.4. Let K be a ﬁeld. The group SL2(K) is generated by the union of the two subgroups

. Hence, every matrix, in SL2(K) is a ﬁnite product of
matrices which either upper triangular or lower triangular and which have 1’s along the diagonal.
These matrices are called unipotent matrices or transvections.

Theorem 3.4.5. Let K be a ﬁeld. The elementary matrices Xij(a), deﬁned in the proof of Theorem
3.4.1, generate SLn(K).
Proof. If n = 1, then SL1(K) = {1} is trivial. Lemma 3.4.4 gives the case n = 2. For n > 2, the
theorem follows from the mathematical induction in a similar manner.
Lemma 3.4.6. The elementary matrices Xij(a), deﬁned in the proof of Theorem 3.4.1, are com-
mutators in SLn(K) except in the case n = 2 and (|K| = 2 or 3).
Proof. If n ≥3, this is easy since there is a third index k and [Xik(a), Xkj(a)] = Xij(a). If n = 2,
we use the commutator relation

However, given any λ ∈K, the equation λ = (α2 −1)β can be solved for β if and only if there
exists a nonzero α ∈K so that α2 ̸= 1 (i.e., α ̸= ±1). This works as long as K× has at least three
elements.
Corollary 3.4.7. Let K be a ﬁeld. If n ≥2, then SLn(K) is not solvable except in the cases SL2(F2)
and SL2(F3).
Remark. SL2(F2) ∼= PSL2(F2) ∼= S3, SL2(F3) ∼= S4 and PSL2(F3) ∼= A4. They are solvable groups.
Moreover, PSL2(F2) and PSL2(F3) are not simple.
The following theorem was proved by C. Jordan in 1870 for |K| prime. In 1893, after F.
Cole discovered a simple group G of order 504, E. H. Moore recognized G as PSL2(F8), and then
proved the simplicity of PSL2(K) for all K of size ≥4. It provides an example of inﬁnite simple
groups.
Theorem 3.4.8. [Jordan-Moore] Let K be a ﬁeld with |K| ≥4. Then PSL2(K) is a simple group.
Proof. Using the third isomorphism theorem, it sufﬁces to prove that a normal subgroup N of
SL2(K) containing a matrix other than ±I2 must be all of SL2(K). Let A ̸= ±I2 be a matrix in N.
Then there is a vector ⃗v in K2 so that ⃗v and A⃗v are linearly independent over K. This means that
{⃗v, A⃗v} is a basis of K2. The matrix representation of A with respect to this basis is
0

(since
A⃗v = 0 · ⃗v + 1 · A⃗v and A(A⃗v) = b · ⃗v + d · A⃗v for some b, d ∈K). Since det A = 1, we actually
have b = −1. That is, A is conjugate to

is also in N.
Our strategy is to show that N contains all unipotent elements in SL2(K) by repeatedly using
the fact that “C−1B−1CB ∈N for all C ∈SL2(K) and B ∈N”. First, apply this trick with B = A
and C =

or if |K| = 4 since F×

Free Groups and Presentations
There is a basic method of deﬁning a group G, called a presentation of G by generators and
deﬁning relations.
We have used this method without deﬁning it precisely.
For example, ⟨a⟩
means the cyclic group generated by a. If a happened to be an element of some larger group G,
then ⟨a⟩means the subgroup of G generated by ⟨a⟩. It could be inﬁnite cyclic or ﬁnite cyclic. More
generally, if we were working a particular group G, and a1, . . . , ak ∈G, then ⟨a1, . . . ak⟩denoted
the subgroup of G generated by a1, . . . ak.
However, when we were not talking about subgroups of a particular group G, then the brackets
⟨⟩had a different meaning as shown by the following examples.
Examples 3.5.1.
1. ⟨a⟩∼= Z
and
⟨a : an = e⟩∼= Zn.
2. ⟨a, b : an = e, bm = e, ab = ba⟩= ⟨a, b : an = e, bm = e, aba−1b−1 = e⟩∼= Zn × Zm.

5. Dn = ⟨a, b : an = b2 = e, bab−1 = a−1⟩= ⟨a, b : an = b2 = e, bab−1a = e⟩is the dihedral
group of order 2n.
6. D∞= ⟨a, b : b2 = e, bab−1 = a−1⟩= ⟨a, b : b2 = e, bab−1a = e⟩is the inﬁnite dihedral group.

In each of the above examples the data inside the brackets ⟨⟩is sufﬁcient to describe a group,
that is, it gives the multiplication table for a groups. We call such an expression a presentation for
the group. It turns out that every group has a presentation and every presentation deﬁnes a group.
However, it is generally difﬁcult to decide if a group deﬁned by a presentation is isomorphic to an
explicitly given group.
Let A be any (not necessarily ﬁnite) set of elements ai for i ∈I. We think of A as an alphabet
set and of the ai as letters in the alphabet set. Any symbol of the form an
i with n ∈Z is a syllable
and a ﬁnite string w of syllables written in juxtaposition is a word. We also introduce the empty
word 1, which has no syllables. A word on A is reduced if w = 1 or the string aia−i or a−iai does
not appear in w for all a ∈A and i ∈N.
Let A be a set. Write F[A] for the set of all reduced words formed from our alphabet A. For
convenience, we may let F[∅] = {1}. We make F[A] into a group by the juxtaposition w1w2 of

3.5. Free Groups and Presentations
97
two words w1 and w2 with reduction of strings aia−i or a−iai (if any) for all a ∈A and i ∈N. It
is called the free group generated by A.
Example 3.5.2. The only example of a free group that has occurred before is Z, which is free on
one generators. Clearly, every free group is inﬁnite.
Example 3.5.3. F2 = ⟨x, y⟩. The element of F2 are all words in x and y. More precisely, F2 is the
disjoint union of the following seven sets.
1. {1}
4. {xi1yj1 . . . xikyjk : k > 0, ir, jr ∈Z ∖{0}}
2. {xi : i ∈Z ∖{0}}
5. {xi1yj1 . . . xikyjkxik+1 : k > 0, ir, jr ∈Z ∖{0}}
3. {yi : i ∈Z ∖{0}}
6. {yj1xi1 . . . yjkxik : k > 0, ir, jr ∈Z ∖{0}}
7. {yj1xi1 . . . yjkxikyjk+1 : k > 0, ir, jr ∈Z ∖{0}}
Let G be a group and let A be a subset of G such that ⟨A⟩= G. If G is isomorphic to F[A]
under the map ϕ : G →F[A] such that ϕ(a) = a for all a ∈A, then G is said to be free on A. A
group is free if it is free on some nonempty set A.
Theorem 3.5.1. [Universal Mapping Property of a Free Group] Let A be a nonempty set. Suppose
H is any group and there is a function φ : A →H.
1. There is a unique homomorphism Φ : F[A] →H extending φ.
2. If im φ generates H, then Φ : F[A] →H is a surjection.
3. If G is a group and θ : G →F[A] is an onto homomorphism, then there is a homomorphism
Φ : F[A] →G such that θ ◦Φ = id F[A], the identity map on F[A].
Proof. (1) is clear and (2) follows immediately from (1).
(3) Since θ is onto, for each a ∈A, there is a ga ∈G such that θ(ga) = a. By (1), there is a unique
homomorphism Φ : F[A] →H with Φ(a) = ga for all a ∈A. Then θ ◦Φ : F[A] →F[A] is the
identity map.
Similarly, we can show that
Corollary 3.5.2. Let S be a set. Then there is a unique free group on S.
Proof. Let G1 and G2 be free groups on S. Then S is a subset of both G1 and G2. Consider the
inclusion maps ι1 : S →G1 and ι2 : S →G2 and the result follows from the uniqueness of the
universal mapping property.
Corollary 3.5.3. Every group H is a homomorphic image of a free group.
Proof. Let A be a set for which there exists a bijection φ : A →H (e.g., take A = H and φ = id H),
and let G = F[A]. By the universal mapping property, there is an onto homomorphism Φ : G →H
extending φ. Therefore, G/(ker Φ) ∼= H.
We refer the reader to reference textbooks for proofs of the next three theorems. They are
stated simply to inform us of these interesting facts.
Theorem 3.5.4. If a group G is free on A and also on B (not necessarily ﬁnite), then the sets A
and B have the same number of elements; that is, any two sets of generators of a free group have
the same cardinality.
We shall prove this theorem for the ﬁnite basis case with some result on ﬁnitely generated free
abelian group (Corollary 4.2.7) in the next chapter.
If G is free on a set A, the number of elements in A is called the rank of G.

3. Advanced Group Theory
Theorem 3.5.5. Two free groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank.
Theorem 3.5.6. [Schreier] A nontrivial proper subgroup of a free group is free.
This is not trivial to prove. There is a nice proof of this result using covering spaces (cf. J.-P.
Serre, Trees, Springer-Verlag, 1980).
Example 3.5.4. Let yl = xlyx−l for l ≥0. Then yl, l ≥0, are free generators for the subgroup of
F2 = ⟨x, y⟩that they generate. This illustrates that although a subgroup of a free group is free,
the rank of the subgroup may be much greater than the rank of the whole group!
Let G
θ
/ H
φ
/ K be a sequence of groups homomorphisms. We say that it is exact at H
if im θ = ker φ. A short exact sequence of groups is a sequence of groups and homomorphisms
1
/ G
θ
/ H
φ
/ K
/ 1
which is exact at G, H and K. In other words, if θ is 1-1, φ is onto and im θ = ker φ.
Remark. If N is a normal subgroup of G, then 1 →N →G →G/N →1 is exact. Conversely, if
1 →N
ι→G →H →1 is exact, then N is normal in G and H ∼= G/N. Thus short exact sequences
are just another notation for normal subgroups and factor groups.
A presentation for a group G is an expression
G = ⟨g1, . . . , gr : w1 = · · · = wt = 1⟩
where w1, . . . , wt are words in g1, . . . , gr such that the following two properties are satisﬁed: (1)
g1, . . . , gr generate G and (2) the conditions that w1 = w2 = · · · = wt = 1 are sufﬁcient to deﬁne
the multiplication table of G. Here, g1, . . . , gr are called generators of G in the presentation and
w1, w2, . . . , wt are called deﬁning relations.
Note that the free group of rank n is the group Fn = ⟨x1, . . . , xn : ⟩given by a presentation
with n generators and zero deﬁning relation.
Remark. The elements of ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩are words in x1, . . . , xn. Suppose w = w(x1, . . . , xn) is
any such word. Then if G is any group, we can think of w as a function G × · · · × G →G
such that (g1, . . . , gn) 7→w(g1, . . . , gn). For example, if w(x1, x2) = [x1, x2] = x1x2x−1
1 x−1
2 , then
w(g1, g2) = g1g2g−1
1 g−1
2 .
Remark. If we have Fn = ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩is a free group and G = ⟨y1, . . . , yn : w1 = · · · = wt =
1⟩, then the universal mapping property of a free group says that φ(xi) = yi deﬁnes an onto
homomorphism φ : Fn →G. This means we have a short exact sequence
1
/ ker φ
ι
/ Fn
φ
/ G
/ 1.
What is the kernel of φ? ker φ is a normal subgroup of Fn and contains wi(x1, . . . , xn) for i =
1, . . . , t. In fact, ker φ is the smallest normal subgroup of Fn which contains wi(x1, . . . , xn) for
i = 1, . . . , t.
Let G be a group and S a subset of G. The normal closure of S in G, denoted by ⟨S⟩G, is the
smallest normal subgroup of G containing S. It is the subgroup of G generated by all conjugates
of elements of S by elements of G. That is,
⟨S⟩G = ⟨xyx−1 : x ∈G and y ∈S⟩
and so

3.5. Free Groups and Presentations
99
Theorem 3.5.7. Let G = ⟨x1, . . . , xn : w1 = · · · = wt = 1⟩. Then G ∼= F/N where N is the
normal closure of {w1, . . . , wt} in the free group F = F[{x1, . . . , xn}].
Example 3.5.5. Consider the free group F2 = ⟨x, y⟩. Let G = ⟨x, y : xyx−1y−1 = 1⟩∼= F2/N.
Since G is abelian, F ′
2 ⊆N. But xyx−1y−1 ∈N and N is the smallest, so N = F ′
2.
Example 3.5.6. Consider the quaternion group Q8 = ⟨a, b : a4 = 1, a2 = b2, ba = a3b⟩of order
eight. We shall determine the structure of Q8/Q′
8. Since |a| = 4 and ba = a3b, ⟨a⟩⊳Q8 and b /∈⟨a⟩,
so Q8/⟨a⟩= {⟨a⟩, b⟨a⟩}. Then Q′
8 ⊆⟨a⟩. Since a2 = a−1bab−1 ∈Q′
8, ⟨a2⟩⊆Q′
8 ⊆⟨a⟩. In addition,
ba2b−1 = a−2. Thus, ⟨a2⟩is normal in Q8. Since |Q8/⟨a2⟩| = 4, it is abelian. Hence, Q′
8 = ⟨a2⟩.
Note that a2Q′
8 = b2Q′
8 = Q′
8. Therefore, Q8/Q′
8 ∼= Z2 × Z2.
Theorem 3.5.8. [von Dyck’s Theorem /fon dike/] Let G be given by a presentation
G = ⟨x1, . . . , xn : w1 = · · · = wt = 1⟩.
Suppose H is any group which satisﬁes:
1. H is generated by h1, . . . , hn
and
2. wi(h1, . . . , hn) = 1 for i = 1, . . . , t.
Then there is a unique onto homomorphism φ : G →H for which φ(xi) = hi.
Proof. By Theorem 3.5.7, G ∼= F/N, where F is a free group on {x1, . . . , xn} and N is the
normal closure of {w1, . . . , wt}. By the assumption N ⊆ker φ, so φ induces a (well deﬁned)
homomorphism xi = xiN 7→hi for all i ∈{1, . . . , n}.
Example 3.5.7. Classify all groups G of order six.
Proof. Since 6 = 2 · 3, G contains elements a and b such that |a| = 2 and |b| = 3 and G = ⟨a, b⟩.
Since ⟨b⟩is normal in G, aba−1 ∈⟨b⟩. Thus, aba−1 = b or aba−1 = b−1. If aba−1 = b, then G is
abelian, so G ∼= Z6. Assume that aba−1 = b−1. Then G = ⟨a, b : a2, b3, aba−1 = b−1⟩. Note that
S3 = ⟨(12), (123)⟩and (12)(123)(12)−1 = (132) = (123)−1. By von Dyck’s theorem, there is an
onto homomorphism from G to S3. But |G| = 6 = |S3|, G ∼= S3.
To close this section, we introduce a graphical representation of a group given by a set of
generators and relations. The idea was originated by Cayley in 1878. It provided a method of
visualizing a group and connects two important branches of modern mathematics—groups and
graphs. This also has many applications to computer science.
Let G be a ﬁnite group and S a nonempty subset of G. To avoid loops, we shall assume that
e /∈S. The Cayley digraph of G with generating set S is a digraph Cay(G, S) such that
1. each element of G is a vertex of Cay(G, S), and
2. for x, y ∈G, there is a directed edge from x to y if and only if x−1y ∈S.
We call the ﬁnite sequence of vertices such that x1
/ x2
/ · · ·
/ xn a directed path. A
directed graph is connected if for every pair of vertices x, z, there is a directed path from x to z.
A maximal connected subdigraph of a digraph is called a connected component.
Example 3.5.8. For the group (Z6, +), we consider the following two digraphs. The ﬁrst one is
connected while the second one is not. The second one has two connected components.

Example 3.5.9. For the group (S3, ◦), we consider the following three digraphs. The ﬁrst and
the second ones are not connected. They have three connected components and two connected
component, respectively. The last one is connected. Note also that since (12)−1 = (12), some
edges are undirected.

For a non-empty subset S of a group G, we let S−1 = s−1 : s ∈S. Observe that if we assume
further that e /∈S and S = S−1, then the Cayley graph Cay(G, S) is an undirected graph without
loops. Hence, it is a graph.
A regular graph is a graph such that each vertex has the same number of neighbors which is
called the degree of a regular graph. Note that for each x ∈G, we have x
xs for all s ∈S.
From the cancellative property in G, each vertex has |S| neighbors, so Cay(G, S) is a regular
graph of degree |S|.
Theorem 3.5.9. Let G be a group and S a nonempty subset of G such that e /∈S and S = S−1.
Then
1. Cay(G, S) is a regular graph of degree |S|.
2. For x, z ∈G, there is a path from x to z if and only if x−1z ∈⟨S⟩.
3. The number of connected components of Cay(G, S) is the index [G : ⟨S⟩].
4. Cay(G, S) is connected if and only if ⟨S⟩= G.

3.5. Free Groups and Presentations
101
Proof. Clearly, (4) follows from (3) and (3) follows from (2), respectively.
To prove (2), let
x, z ∈G. Since S = S−1, ⟨S⟩= {s1s2 . . . sk : k ∈N ∪{0} and s1, s2, . . . , sk ∈S}. Also, any path
from x to z is given by
x
xs1
xs1s2
· · ·
xs1s2 . . . sk = z
for some s1, s2, . . . , sk. Thus, there is a path from x to z if and only if x−1z = s1s2 . . . sk ∈⟨S⟩.
Finally, we provides some examples of Cayley graph arising from number theory and ring
theory.
Example 3.5.10. For n ≥3, consider the additive group (Zn, +). We know that for ¯a ∈Zn,
¯a ∈Z×
n ⇔−¯a ∈Z×
n , so Z×
n = −Z×
n . The Cayley graph Xn = Cay(Zn, Z×
n ) is called the unitary
Cayley graph. More generally, if R is a ﬁnite ring and consider (R, +) is an additive group, then
the unitary Cayley graph for R is the Cayley graph XR = Cay(R, R×).
Example 3.5.11. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative ring with unity 1 ̸= 0. Consider the exact se-
quence of groups
1
/ KR
/ R×
θ
/ (R×)2
/ 1
where θ : a →a2 is the square mapping on R× with kernel KR and (R×)2 = {a2 : a ∈R×}.
Note that KR consists of the identity and all elements of order two in R×. Let TR = KR(R×)2.
Since −1 ∈TR, the Cayley graphs HR = Cay(R, TR) is undirected. This graph is a subgraph of
the unitary Cayley graph. It is called the restricted unitary Cayley graphs induced from the
square mapping. It is a generalization of Paley graphs (see Project 25).

“Algebraic Graph Theory” is a branch of mathematics in which algebraic methods are applied
to problems about graphs. There are three main branches of algebraic graph theory, involving
the use of linear algebra, the use of group theory, and the study of graph invariants. The ﬁrst
branch of algebraic graph theory involves the study of graphs in connection with linear algebra.
Mainly, it studies the spectrum of the adjacency matrix, or the Laplacian matrix of a graph (this
part of algebraic graph theory is also called spectral graph theory). Secondly, algebraic graph
theory involves the study of graphs in connection to group theory, particularly automorphism
groups and geometric group theory. The focus is placed on various families of graphs based on
symmetry such as symmetric graphs, vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs, distance-
transitive graphs, distance-regular graphs, and strongly regular graphs. Finally, the third branch
of algebraic graph theory concerns algebraic properties of invariants of graphs, and especially the

chromatic polynomial, the Tutte polynomial and knot invariants. The references and related work
can be found in Godsil and Royle’s celebrated book [14].
There are many graphs arising from number theory and ﬁnite ﬁeld theory such as Cayley
graphs, symplectic graphs (Subsection 4.7.2), Paley graphs (see Project 25) and functional di-
graphs (e.g., [36, 37]). Moreover, these graphs can be extended to general results in abstract
integral domains, e.g., function ﬁelds, PID or even UFD (see, [27] and the following project).
Project 20 (gcd-graph). We consider a unique factorization domain D. Let c ∈D be a nonzero nonunit
element. Assume that the commutative ring D/(c) is ﬁnite. Let C be a set of proper divisor of c. Deﬁne the
gcd-graph, Dc(C), to be a graph whose vertex set is the quotient ring D/(c) and edge set is {{x + (c), y +
(c)} : x, y ∈D and gcd(x −y, c) ∈C}. The gcd considered here is unique up to associate. Prove that that
Dc({1}) = GD/(c) = Cay(D/(c), D/(c)×), the unitary Cayley graph in Example 3.5.10. This gcd-graph on
a quotient ring of a unique factorization domain (UFD) introduced in [27] generalizes a gcd-graph or an
integral circulant graph (i.e., its adjacency matrix is circulant and all eigenvalues are integers) deﬁned over
Zn, n ≥2, (see [29, 39]). An integral circulant graph can also be considered as an extension of a unitary
Cayley graph.
Project 21 (Energy of a graph). Let G be a graph with vertex set {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. The adjacency matrix
of G, denoted by A(G), is the n × n matrix given by
aij =
(
1
if there is an edge joining vi and vj,
0
otherwise.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a graph G are deﬁned to be the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its
adjacency matrix A(G). The sum of absolute values of all eigenvalues of a graph G is called the energy of
G and denoted by E(G).
Let R be a ﬁnite local ring with unique maximal ideal M of size m. For k, l ∈N, we write 0k×l and
Jk×l for the k × l matrix whose all entries are 0 and 1, respectively. We also use ⃗0k = 0k×1 and ⃗1k = Jk×1.
(a) Prove that the adjacency matrix of the unitary Cayley graph Cay(R, R×) is given by

Modules and Noetherian Rings
Modules can be considered as a generalization of vector spaces. It is like we study linear algebra
over a ring. In this chapter, we ﬁrst cover basic concepts of modules. Next, we work on free
modules.
Projective and injective modules are introduced.
We also present the proof of the
structure theorems for modules over a PID. Finally, we talk about Noetherian and Artinion rings.
Noetherian rings have a lot of applications in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory.
Each ring R that we consider will be assumed to contain a multiplicative identity element,
which will be denoted by 1. We shall therefore regard the possession of such an identity as one of
the deﬁning conditions of the ring concept and also assume 1 ̸= 0.
4.1
Modules
The deﬁnition of a module is similar to a vector space. However, now our scalars are in a ring.
Let R be a ring. We say that M is a (left) R-module provided:
1. (M, +) is an additive abelian group
2. there is a multiplication R × M →M which satisﬁes for all α, β ∈R and u, v ∈M,
(a) α(u + v) = αu + αv,
(b) (α + β)u = αu + βu and
(c) α(βu) = (αβ)u
3. if 1 is the unity of R, then 1 · u = u for all u ∈M.
Remark. Note that we abuse notations by not distinguishing between the addition in M or in R
and the multiplication in R or the multiplication R × M →M. A right R-module can be deﬁned
analogously.
Examples 4.1.1.
1. If R = F, a ﬁeld, an F-module is just a vector space over F.
2. Any abelian group A is a Z-module, where the action of Z is given by for a ∈A,
0 · a = 0A, n · a = a + a + · · · + a
|
{z
}
n
if n > 0
and
n · a = (−a) + (−a) + · · · + (−a)
|
{z
}
−n
if n < 0.
3. Let F be a ﬁeld and R = Mn(F) the ring of n × n matrices over F. Let V = F n be n-
dimensional vector space of n × 1 column vectors over F. Then V is an R-module where
the multiplication R × V →V is given by A · ⃗v = A⃗v (matrix multiplication).
4. Let R be a ring. Then R is an R-module with the usual multiplication R × R →R. More
generally, any left ideal A of R is a left R-module. In fact, a subset A of R is a left ideal in
R if and only if the left multiplication R × A →A makes A into a left R-module. That is,
the set of left ideals of R is the set left R-modules of R. Hence, if R is a ring, then R can
be viewed as an R-module, called a regular left [right] R-module, and is denoted by RR
[RR].
103

104
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
We collect basic terminologies about modules in the following deﬁnitions.
Let R be a ring. We say that N is an R-submodule or submodule of an R-module M if N is a
subgroup of M as an additive group and the multiplications R × M →M and R × N →N agree
on N.
Let R be a ring. The direct sum of R-modules M and N is the abelian group direct sum of M
and N
M ⊕N = {(m, n) : m ∈M, n ∈N}
with the action of R on M ⊕N given by
r(m, n) = (rm, rn).
One often writes m + n in place of (m, n).
Let R be a ring and let M and N be R-modules.
1. A map f : M →N is an R-module homomorphism provided
(a) f : M →N is a homomorphism of abelian groups and
(b) if r ∈R and m ∈M, then f(rm) = rf(m).
2. We call a diagram of R-module homomorphisms
M
f
/ N
g
/ P
exact if im f = ker g. More generally, a sequence of R-modules and homomorphisms
· · ·
/ M1
f1
/ M2
f2
/ M3
/ · · ·
that may be ﬁnite or run to inﬁnity in either direction is called exact if for any three consec-
utive terms the subsequence Mi
/ Mi+1
/ Mi+2 is exact. An exact sequence of the
form
0
/ M′
f
/ M
g
/ M′′
/ 0
is called a short exact sequence. This means that f is a monomorphism (1-1), g is an
epimorphism (onto) and ker g = im f.
3. If N is a submodule of M, then the quotient group (M/N, +) can be made into an R-module
by deﬁning r(x + N) = rx + N. It is called a factor module of M by N.
4. Let f : M →N be a homomorphism of R-modules. The kernel of f is
ker f = {m ∈M : f(m) = 0N}
and the cokernel of f is N/im f. They are clear that ker f and im f are R-submodules of
M and N, respectively. Evidently, f is surjective if and only if coker f = 0. In any case, we
have
0
/ ker f  
/ M
f
/ N
/ coker f
/ 0
is exact.
Remark. The isomorphism theorems also hold for R-modules and their homomorphisms. Note
however that the ﬁrst isomorphism theorem will say a bit more, because coker f = N/im f is an
R-module. This is not the case with homomorphisms of groups or rings: If f : G →H is a group
homomorphism, then f(G) = im f is not in general a normal subgroup of H, hence H/im f is not
in general a group. And if f : R →S is a ring homomorphism, then f(R) = im f is never an ideal
in S (unless it is all of S), so S/im f is not a ring.
The isomorphism theorems can be stated as theorems about commutative diagrams and ex-
act sequences. The use of diagrams to describe module homomorphisms is very common, we
now give the isomorphism theorems in their diagram theoretic versions. Note that many ho-
momorphisms are projections or injections implicitly deﬁned by the diagram. The proofs of the
isomorphism theorems are left as exercises.

4.1. Modules

Proof. The commutativity and the exactness of the top two rows and the two left columns are
clear. The exactness of the third row and right column come, respectively, from the isomorphisms
(N1 + N2)/N2 ∼= N1/(N1 ∩N2) and (N1 + N2)/N1 ∼= N2/(N1 ∩N2).
The next theorem is widely used in mathematics. It is proved by the technique called “diagram
chasing”.

If f1, f2, f4 and f5 are isomorphisms, so is f3. More precisely,
1. if f1 is onto and f2 and f4 are 1-1, then f3 is 1-1, and
2. if f5 is 1-1 and f2 and f4 are onto, then f3 is onto.
Proof. (1) Assume f1 is onto and f2 and f4 are 1-1. Suppose x ∈A3 and f3(x) = 0. We shall
show that x = 0. Since f4(α3(x) = β3(f3(x)) = β3(0) = 0 and f4 is 1-1, α3(x) = 0, so x ∈
ker α3 = im α2 from the exactness of the top row. Thus, x = α2(y) for some y ∈A2. Then
0 = f3(x) = f3(α2(y)) = β2(f2(y)), so f2(y) ∈ker β2 = im β1 from the exactness of the bottom
row. Thus, f2(y) = β1(z) for some z ∈B1. Since f1 is onto, there is a u ∈A1 with f1(u) = z.
Then f2(y) = β1(z) = β1(f1(u)) = f2(α1(u)), so y = α1(u) since f2 is 1-1. Hence, x = α2(y) =
α2(α1(u)) = 0 since α2α1 = 0 by the exactness of the top row.
(2) Assume f5 is 1-1 and f2 and f4 are onto. Let x ∈B3. We must ﬁnd w ∈A3 with f3(w) = x.
Since f4 is onto, we can choose y ∈A4 with f4(y) = β3(x). Then f5(α4(y)) = β4(f4(y)) =
β4(β3(x)) = 0 from the bottom row is exact. But f5 is 1-1, so α4(y) = 0. Since the top row is exact,
y = α3(z) for some z ∈A3. Then β3(x) = f4(y) = f4(α3(z)) = β3(f3(z)), so β3(x −f3(z)) = 0.
Thus, there is a u ∈B2 with β2(u) = x −f3(z) from the bottom row is exact. Since f2 is onto,
there is a v ∈A2 with f2(v) = u.
Hence, x −f3(z) = β2(u) = β2(f2(v)) = f3(α2(v)), so
x = f3(z + α2(v)) = f3(w) where w = z + α2(v). That is, f3 is onto.
Theorem 4.1.6. [Split Exact Sequence] Let 0
/ L
α
/ M
β
/ N
/ 0 be a short exact
sequence of R-modules. Then the following three conditions are equivalent.
(i) There exists an isomorphism M ∼= L ⊕N in which α : l 7→(l, 0) and β : (l, n) 7→n.
(ii) There exists a section of β, that is, a homomorphism s : N →M such that β ◦s = id N.
(iiii) There exists a retraction of α, that is, a homomorphism r : M →L such that r ◦α = id L.
If this happens, the sequence is a split exact sequence.
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii) or (iii) is easy.
(ii) ⇒(i). The given section s is clearly injective because it has a left inverse; we claim that
M = α(L) ⊕s(N). To see this, any m ∈M is of the form
m = (m −s(β(m))) + s(β(m)),
where the second term is obviously in s(N); since β ◦s = id N, the ﬁrst term is clearly in ker β,
and by exactness this is α(L). Furthermore, α(L) ∩s(N) = {0}, since if n ∈N is such that
s(n) ∈α(L) = ker β then n = β(s(n)) = 0.
(iii) ⇒(i) is similar to (ii) ⇒(i) and left as an exercise.
For ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces over a ﬁeld, every subspace has complement, so every
short exact sequence splits. Whether an exact sequence splits or not depends on what ring it is
considered over. For example,
0
/ k[x]x
/ k[x]
/ k[x]/k[x]x
/ 0
is split over k but not over k[x].

4.2. Free Modules and Matrices

Proof. It is easy to see that k[x] ∼= k ⊕k[x]x as k-vector spaces. Note that k is a k[x]-module, where the
scalar multiplication is given by (a0 +a1x+· · ·+anxn)c = a0c for all c, ai ∈k. Assume that k[x]
ϕ∼= k⊕k[x]x
as k[x]-modules and ϕ : 1 7→(a0, a1x + · · · + anxn). Then for all m ∈N ∪{0} and b0, b1, . . . , bm ∈k,
(b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm)
ϕ7→(b0a0, (b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm)(a1x + · · · + anxn)).
Since ϕ is 1-1, a0 ̸= 0. Since ϕ is onto, a2, . . . , an = 0 and a1 ̸= 0. Thus, we reduce the above map to
(b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm)
ϕ7→(b0a0, a1(b0x + b1x2 + · · · + bmxm+1)).
Consider (0, x) in k + k[x]x. If ϕ(b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm) = (0, x), then b0a0 = 0 and a1b0 = 1 which is
impossible because a0 and a1 are nonzero. Hence, ϕ is not onto which is a contradiction.

Free Modules and Matrices
Like a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld, we shall see in this section that a free module
(i.e., a module with basis) over a commutative ring behaves in a similar way.
Let M1, . . . , Mk be R-modules. The direct sum of M1, . . . , Mk is the set of k-tuples
{(m1, . . . , mk) : mi ∈Mi}
with the following operations:
(m1, . . . , mk) + (n1, . . . , nk) = (m1 + n1, . . . , mk + nk)
r(m1, . . . , mk) = (rm1, . . . , rmk), r ∈R.
The direct sum of M1, . . . , Mk is denoted by M1 ⊕· · · ⊕Mk or
k
M
i=1
Mi.
Let M1, . . . , Mk be submodules of an R-module M. The sum of M1, . . . , Mk is the set
{m1 + · · · + mk : mi ∈Mi for all i},
denoted by M1 + · · · + Mk or
n
X
i=1
Mi. It is a submodule of M. We say that M1, . . . , Mk are
independent if for any mi ∈Mi with m1 + · · · + mk = 0, we have m1 = · · · = mk = 0M. This
condition is equivalent to Mi ∩
X
j̸=i
Mi = {0M} for all i.

4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Theorem 4.2.1. Let M1, . . . , Mk be submodules of an R-module M. Then
1. The map φ : M1 ⊕· · ·⊕Mk →M deﬁned by φ(m1, . . . , mk) = m1 +· · ·+mk is an R-module
homomorphism whose image is M1 + · · · + Mk.
2. φ is one-to-one if and only if M1, . . . , Mk are independent submodules of M. In case φ is an
isomorphism, we say that M is the internal direct sum of the submodules M1, . . . , Mk.
Let M be an R-module and X a subset of M. The submodule of M generated by X, denoted
by RX, is the set of all ﬁnite sums
{r1x1 + · · · + rkxk : ri ∈R and xi ∈X}.
If RX = M, we say that X generates or spans M. If some ﬁnite subset {x1, . . . , xk} of M
generates M, we say that M is ﬁnitely generated M and we write
M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxk.
If M is generated by a single element, i.e., if M = Rx for some x ∈M, M is said to be cyclic.
We say that x1, . . . , xk ∈M are linearly independent over R if for any r1, . . . , rk ∈R with
r1x1 + · · · + rkxk = 0M, we have r1 = · · · = rk = 0. A subset X (possibly inﬁnite) of M is linearly
independent if every ﬁnite subset of X is linearly independent. We say that a set X is linearly
dependent if it is not linearly independent.
Remarks.
1. By convention, the empty set is linearly independent and R∅= {0M}.
2. If x ∈M, {x} is a linearly independent set if and only if Rx ∼= R as left R-modules. In
particular, if we take M = R, a left R-module, then {x} is a linearly independent set (where
x ∈R) if and only if x is not a right zero divisor, i.e., a ̸= 0 ⇒ax ̸= 0.
3. If {x1, . . . , xk} is a linearly independent set, then Rx1 + · · · + Rxk ∼= R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z

as left
R-modules.
4. Any subset of a linearly independent set is a linearly independent set.
If an R-module M is generated by a linearly independent set X, we say that M is the free
R-module on the set X and that X is a basis for M. If X = {x1, . . . , xk} is a ﬁnite set, we say
that M is the ﬁnitely generated free module spanned by x1, . . . , xk.
Now let M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxn be the free R-module on the set X = {x1, . . . , xn}. Suppose N
is any left R-module and y1, . . . , yn are any elements of N. Let us deﬁne a map φ : M →N by
φ(r1x1 + · · · + rnxn) = r1y1 + · · · + rnyn.
Then φ is a homomorphism of left R-modules such that φ(xi) = yi for all i. In fact, we could also
deﬁne a homomorphism even if X were inﬁnite. The point is that any set map X →N gives rise
to an R-module homomorphism M →N. More precisely,
Theorem 4.2.2. [Universal Mapping Property of a Free Module] Let R be a ring, X a set and
M = M(X) the free R-module on the set X. Let i : X →M be deﬁned by i(x) = 1 · x for all
x ∈X. (i may be thought of as an inclusion map.) Suppose N is an R-module and α : X →N is
a set map. Then there exists a unique R-module homomorphism θ : M →N such that θ ◦i = α.

Hence, any module is a homomorphic image of a free module.

4.2. Free Modules and Matrices

Next, let us consider homomorphism of ﬁnitely generated free R-modules. Suppose M and N
are free R-modules with bases X = {x1, . . . , xm} and Y = {y1, . . . , yn} where
M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxm and N = Ry1 + · · · + Ryn.
Let φ : M →N be an R-module homomorphism. Then φ will be completely deﬁned as soon as
we specify φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm). Moreover, by the above theorem, any choice of φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm) is
possible. Hence,
φ ↔(φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm))
is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of R-module homomorphisms φ : M →N and N×· · ·×N
(m-copies). We have not written N ⊕· · · ⊕N because so far this correspondence is only a 1-1
correspondence of sets. We do not know if any structure is preserved.
Let M and N be R-modules. The set of R-module homomorphisms from M to N is denoted
by homR(M, N).
Remarks.
1. homR(M, N) is an abelian group with the addition given by
(φ + θ)(m) = φ(m) + θ(m).
2. If R is commutative, then we can make homR(M, N) into a left R-module by deﬁning
(rφ)(m) = rφ(m). Note that rφ : M →N is really an R-module homomorphism, for if
m ∈M, s ∈R, then
(rφ)(sm) = r(φ(sm)) = r(sφ(m)) = (rs)φ(m) = (sr)φ(m) = s(rφ(m)) = s[(rφ)(m)].
However, this computation makes it clear that the commutativity of R is essential. If R is
not commutative, there is no natural way to make homR(M, N) into a left R-module.
Let us restate the remarks above in the next theorem.
Theorem 4.2.3. Let M and N be left R-modules.
1. homR(M, N) is an abelian group (or Z-module) with addition (φ + θ)(m) = φ(m) + θ(m).
2. If R is commutative, homR(M, N) is a left R-module, where (rφ)(m) = rφ(m).
3. If M = Rx1 + . . . Rxm is the free R-module with basis x1, . . . , xm, then
homR(M, N) −→N ⊕· · · ⊕N
φ 7−→(φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm))
is an isomorphism of abelian groups. If R is commutative, it is an isomorphism of R-modules.
For k ≥1 and a ring R, let Rk denote the R-module of k × 1 column vectors over R. Now
let us return to free R-modules M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxm and N = Ry1 + · · · + Ryn. As noted
earlier, if φ : M →N is an R-module homomorphism, then φ is completely determined by
φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm), and φ 7→(φ(x1), . . . , φ(xm)) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, and it is an
isomorphism of R-modules if R is commutative. Since N = Ry1 + · · · + Ryn is free on y1, . . . , yn
every element of N can be uniquely expressed in the form
y = r1y1 + . . . rnyn.
In particular, we can write
φ(x1) = a11y1 + a21y2 + · · · + an1yn
φ(x2) = a12y1 + a22y2 + · · · + an2yn
...
φ(xm) = a1my1 + a2my2 + · · · + anmyn.

Moreover, in case R is commutative, this is an isomorphism of left R-modules.

Similarly, for R-module homomorphisms θ : N →P and τ : M →P deﬁne [θ] ∈Rpn and
[τ] ∈Rpm, respectively. Then φ 7→[φ], θ 7→[θ] and τ 7→[τ] are isomorphisms of R- modules
homR(M, N) ∼= Rnm, homR(N, P) ∼= Rpn and homR(M, P) ∼= Rpm, respectively. Moreover, we
obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2.4. Let R be a commutative ring. Under the above set-up we have:
1. Each matrix [φ] ∈Rnm deﬁnes a homomorphism [φ] : Rm →Rn by left multiplication of an
n × m matrix by an m × 1 matrix. The same is true for [θ] : Rn →Rp and [τ] : Rm →Rp.

A is invertible ⇔A is left invertible ⇔A is right invertible ⇔det A is a unit in R.
In particular, if AC = I, then CA = I. Moreover, we have

Theorem 4.2.5. Let R be a commutative ring and let [φ] ∈Rmn and [θ] ∈Rnm. Suppose [φ][θ] =
Im and [θ][φ] = In are identity matrices of sizes m × m and n × n, respectively. Then m = n.
Proof. Assume that m > n. Then m = n + r for some r ∈N. Write

Thus, 0 = C(AD) = (CA)D = InD = D which contradicts BD = Ir. Hence, m ≤n. Similarly,
we obtain a contradiction if m < n. Therefore, m = n.
Theorem 4.2.6. Let R be a commutative ring and suppose that M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxm and
N = Ry1 + · · · + Ryn are free R-modules with indicated generators. If M and N are isomorphic
R-modules, then m = n.
Proof. Let φ : M →N be an isomorphism with inverse θ : N →M. By Theorem 4.2.4, we can
identify M with m×1 column vectors and N with n×1 column vectors and obtain a commutative
diagram

In other words, [φ] is an n × m matrix and [θ] is an m × n matrix with [φ][θ] = In and [θ][φ] = Im.
Hence, m = n by Theorem 4.2.5.
If M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxm is a free R-module on x1, . . . , xm over a commutative ring R, m is
called the rank of M. In particular, if R = Z, then M is a free abelian group on x1, . . . , xm, and
hence we have shown:
Corollary 4.2.7. If F is a ﬁnitely generated free abelian group, then any two bases of F have the
same number of elements.
Using this corollary, we can verify that if a group G is free on A and also on B, which are ﬁnite
sets, then the sets A and B have the same number of elements. It is Theorem 3.5.4 for the ﬁnite
basis case.
Proof of Theorem 3.5.4 for the ﬁnite basis case. Assume that G is a free group on A and also on B,
where A and B are ﬁnite sets. By Exercise 1, G/G′ is a free abelian group of rank |A| and |B|,
respectively. By Corollary 4.2.7, |A| = |B|.
Remarks.
1. As we have seen that subgroups of a free (abelian) group are free. This is not
true for general R-modules. For example, let R = Z6. Then RR is a free R-module generated
by {1}. N = {0, 2, 4} is an R-submodule of RR. Since ∅does not span N, ∅is not a basis.
If B ̸= ∅is a basis of N, then 0 /∈B, so 2 or 4 are in B. Since 3 · 2 = 0 and 3 · 4 = 0 where
3 ̸= 0, where B is not linearly independent. Hence, submodules of a free module may not be
free.
2. In the case of free abelian groups and vector spaces, it is true that any two bases of have the
same cardinality. This is not true in general as shown in the following example.

112
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Example 4.2.1. Let S be a ring and F a free S-module with inﬁnite denumerable basis {e1,
e2, e3, . . . }. Let R = homS(F, F). Then R is a ring with identity 1R, so {1R} is a basis for RR.
Next, we deﬁne f1, f2 ∈R as follows: f1(e2n) = en, f1(e2n−1) = 0 and f2(e2n) = 0, f2(e2n−1) =
en.
To show that {f1, f2} spans RR, let g ∈R.
Deﬁne g1, g2 ∈R by g1(en) = g(e2n) and
g2(en) = g(e2n−1). Then (g1f1 + g2f2)(e2n−1) = g1f1(e2n−1) + g2f2(e2n−1) = g2(en) = g(e2n−1)
and (g1f1 + g2f2)(e2n) = g1f1(e2n) + g2f2(e2n) = g1(en) = g(e2n). Thus, g = g1f1 + g2f2. Next we
shall prove that {f1, f2} is linearly independent over R. Let h1, h2 ∈R such that h1f1 + h2f2 = 0.
Then for any n ≥1, h1(en) = h1(en) + 0 = h1f1(e2n) + h2f2(e2n) = (h1f1 + h2f2)(e2n) = 0 and
h2(en) = 0 + h2(en) = h1f1(e2n−1) + h2f2(e2n−1) = (h1f1 + h2f2)(e2n−1) = 0, so h1 = h2 = 0.
Hence, {f1, f2} is linearly independent and so it is a basis of RR.

5. Let R be a ring and M, N and N ′ R-modules. Then homR(M, N) and homR(M, N ′) are Z-modules.
For an R-module homomorphism f : N →N ′, we deﬁne hom(M, −)(f) : homR(M, N) →homR(M, N ′)
by
hom(M, −)(f)(h) = f ◦h
for all h ∈homR(M, N). Show that
(a) hom(M, −)(f) is a Z-module homomorphism from homR(M, N) to homR(M, N ′).
(b) If 0 →N

g→N ′′ is exact, then
0
/ homR(M, N)
hom(M,−)(f) / homR(M, N ′)
hom(M,−)(g) / homR(M, N ′′)
is exact.
In a similar manner, one can prove that exactness of N
f→N ′
g→N ′′ →0 implies exactness of
0
/ homR(N ′′, M)
hom(−,M)(g) / homR(N ′, M)
hom(−,M)(f) / homR(N, M)
where hom(−, M)(f)(h) = h ◦f for all h ∈homR(N ′, M) and hom(−, M)(g)(h) = h ◦g for all
h ∈homR(N ′′, M).
6. Let R be a ring, I a proper ideal of R and F a free R-module with a basis X. Then F/IF is a free
R/I-module with a basis of cardinality |X|.

Projective and Injective Modules
The concept of projective modules is a generalization of the idea of a free module. Injective
modules, introduced by Baer, are dual to that of projective modules.
We follow [6] for this
section.
Let R be a ring. An R-module P is called projective if given any diagram

f : P →N can be factored as f = pg for some g : P →M.
We recall that for any module M, if 0

hom(M,i)

is exact. Now suppose M = P is projective. Then given f ∈hom(P, N′′) there exists a g ∈
homR(P, N) such that homR(P, p)(g) = pg = f. Thus, in this case, hom(P, p) is surjective and so
we actually have the exactness of
0

hom(M,i)

hom(M,p)
/ homR(M, N′′)

The converse holds also. Suppose hom(P, −) is exact and suppose M

Then we have the exact sequence 0

map. Applying the exactness of hom(P, −), we obtain the property of a projective module. There-

is also a short exact sequence of Z-modules.
By Theorem 4.2.2, we have:
Theorem 4.3.2. Every free module is projective.
Example 4.3.1. Q is not a projective Z-module.
Proof. Let F be a free Z-module with countable basis X = {x1, x2, . . . }. Deﬁne g : X →Q by
g : xn 7→1

for all n ∈N.
Then g induces a Z-module homomorphism from F to Q. Since g(mxn) = m
n for all m ∈Z and
n ∈N, g is onto. Assume that Q is projective.

all i. This forces k = 1 and ai = 0 for all i. Thus, h is the zero map which contradicts gh = id Q.
Hence, Q is not projective.
How close are projective modules to being free? We shall give two important characterizations
of projective modules as follows.
Theorem 4.3.3. The following properties of a module P are equivalent:
(i) P is projective.
(ii) Any short exact sequence 0
/ M
/ N
/ P
/ 0 splits.
(iii) P is a direct summand of a free module (that is, there exists a free module F isomorphic to
P ⊕P ′ for some P ′).
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii). Let 0

g

By hypothesis we can ﬁll this in with g′ : P →N to obtain a commutative diagram.
Then
gg′ = id P and the given short exact sequence splits.

have a short exact sequence 0
/ P ′
i
/ F
p
/ P
/ 0 where F is a free module. If P
satisﬁes property (ii), then this exact sequence splits and hence F ∼= P ⊕P ′.
(iii) ⇒(i). We are given that there exists a sequence 0

4.3. Projective and Injective Modules

commutative. Hence, P is projective.
Of particular interest are the modules that are ﬁnitely generated and projective. The theorem
gives the following characterization of these modules.
Corollary 4.3.4. A module P is ﬁnitely generated and projective if and only if P is a direct sum-
mand of a free module with a ﬁnite base.
Proof. If P is a direct summand of a free module F with ﬁnite base, then P is projective. Moreover,
P is a homomorphic image of F, so P has a ﬁnite set of generators (the images of the base under
an epimorphism of F onto P). Conversely, suppose P is ﬁnitely generated and projective. Then
the ﬁrst condition implies that we have an exact sequence 0 →P ′ →F →P →0 where F is free
with ﬁnite base. The proof of the theorem shows that if P is projective, then F ∼= P ⊕P ′, so P is
a direct summand of a free module with ﬁnite base.
The concept of a projective module has a dual obtained by reversing the arrows in the deﬁni-
tion as follows.
An R-module Q is called injective if given any diagram of homomorphisms
0
/ N



Q
there exists a homomorphism g : M →Q such that the diagram obtained by ﬁlling in g is
commutative. In other words, given f : N →Q and a monomorphism i : N →M there exists a
g : M →Q such that f = gi.
With a slight change of notation, the deﬁnition amounts to this: Given an exact sequence
0 →N′
i→N, the sequence
homR(N, Q)
hom(i,Q)
/ homR(N′, Q)
/ 0
is exact. Since we know that exactness of 0 →N′
i→N
p→N′′ →0 implies exactness of
0
/ homR(N′′, M)
hom(p,M) / homR(N, M)
hom(i,M)
/ homR(N′, M) ,
it is clear that Q is injective if and only if hom(−, Q) is exact in the sense that it maps any short
exact sequence 0 →N′ →N →N′′ →0 into a short exact sequence of Z-module
0 →homR(N′′, Q) →homR(N, Q) →homR(N′, Q) →0.
It is easily seen also that the deﬁnition of injective is equivalent to the following: If N is a
submodule of a module M, then any homomorphism of N into Q can be extended to a homo-
morphism of M into Q. Another result, which is easily established by dualizing the proof of the
analogous result on projective (Theorem 4.3.3), is that if Q is injective, then any short exact se-
quence 0 →Q →M →N →0 splits. The converse of this holds also. However, the proof requires
the dual of the easy result that any module is a homomorphic image of a projective module (in
fact, a free module). The dual statement is that any module can be embedded in an injective one.
We shall see that this is the case, but the proof will turn out to be fairly difﬁcult.
Theorem 4.3.5. [Baer] A right module Q is injective if and only if any homomorphism of a right
ideal I of R into Q can be extended to a homomorphism of R into Q.

116
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Proof. Obviously, the condition is necessary. Now suppose it holds and suppose M is a module
and f is a homomorphism of a submodule N of M into Q. Consider the set {(g, M′)} where M′
is a submodule of M containing N and g is a homomorphism of M′ into Q such that g|N = f.
We deﬁne a partial order in the set {(g, M′)} by declaring that (g1, M′
1) ≥(g2, M′
2) if M′
1 ⊃M′
2
and g1|M′
2 = g2.
It is clear that any totally ordered subset has an upper bound in this set.
Hence, by Zorn’s lemma, there exists a maximal (g, M′); that is, we have an extension of f to a
homomorphism g of M′ ⊃N which is maximal in the sense that if g1 is a homomorphism of an
M′
1 ⊃M′ such that g1|M′ = g, then necessarily M′
1 = M′. We claim that M′ = M. Otherwise,
there is an x ∈M, /∈M′ and so xR + M′ is a submodule of M properly containing M′. Now let
I = {s ∈R : xs ∈M′}.
Then I = ann(x + M′) in M/M′, so I is a right ideal of R. If s ∈I, then xs ∈M′, so g(xs) ∈Q.
It is immediate that the map h : s 7→g(xs) is a module homomorphism of I into Q. Hence, by
hypothesis, h can be extended to a homomorphism k of R into Q. We shall use this to obtain an
extension of g to a homomorphism of xR + M′ to Q. The elements of xR + M′ have the form
xr + y, r ∈R, y ∈M′. If we have a relation xs + y′ = 0, s ∈R, y′ ∈M′, then s ∈I. Then
k(s) = h(s) = g(xs) = −g(y′).
Thus, xs + y′ = 0 for s ∈R, y′ ∈M′, implies that k(s) + g(y′) = 0. It follows that
xr + y 7→k(r) + g(y),
r ∈R, y ∈M′, is a well deﬁned map. For, if xr1 + y1 = xr2 + y2, ri ∈R, yi ∈M′, then xs + y′ = 0
for s = r1 −r2, y′ = y1 −y2. Then k(s) + g(y′) = 0 and k(r1 −r2) + g(y1 −y2) = 0. Since k and g
are homomorphisms, this implies that k(r1) + g(y1) = k(r2) + g(y2). It is immediate that the map
rx+y 7→k(r)+g(y) is a module homomorphism of xR+M′ into Q extending the homomorphism
g of M′. This contradicts the maximality of (g, M′). Hence, M′ = M and we have proved that if f
is a homomorphism of a submodule N of M into Q, then f can be extended to a homomorphism
of M into Q. Hence, Q is injective.
For certain “nice” rings, the concept of injectivity of modules is closely related to the simpler
notion of divisibility, which we proceed to deﬁne.
If a ∈R, then the module M is said to be divisible by a if the map x 7→xa of M into M
is surjective. A module is called divisible if it is divisible by every a ̸= 0. It is clear that if M is
divisible by a or if M is divisible, then any homomorphic image of M has the same property. In
some sense injectivity is generalization of divisibility, for we have
Theorem 4.3.6.
1. If R has no zero divisors ̸= 0, then any injective R-module is divisible.
2. If R is a ring such that every right ideal of R is principal (= aR for some a ∈R), then any
divisible R-module is injective.
Proof. (1) Suppose R has no zero-divisors ̸= 0 and let Q be an injective R-module. Let x ∈Q, r ∈
R, r ̸= 0. If a, b ∈R and ra = rb, then a = b. Hence, we have a well deﬁned map ra 7→xa, a ∈R,
of the right ideal rR into Q. Clearly this is a module homomorphism. Since Q is injective, the
map ra 7→xa can be extended to a homomorphism of R into Q. If 1 7→y under this extension,
then r = 1r 7→yr. Since r = r1 7→x1 = x, we have x = yr. Since x was arbitrary in Q and r was
any non-zero element of R, this shows that Q is divisible.
(2) Suppose R is a ring in which every right ideal is principal. Let M be a divisible R-module
and let f be a homomorphism of the right ideal rR into M. If r = 0, then f is the zero map
and this can be extended to the zero map of R. If r ̸= 0 and f(r) = x ∈M, then there exists
a y in M such that x = yr. Then a 7→ya is a module homomorphism of R into M and since

4.3. Projective and Injective Modules
117
rb 7→yrb = xb = f(r)b = f(rb), a 7→ya is an extension of f. Thus, any module homomorphism
of a right ideal of R into M can be extended to a homomorphism of R. Hence, M is injective by
Baer’s criterion.
If R satisﬁes both conditions stated in the theorem, then an R-module is injective if and only
if it is divisible. In particular, this holds if R is a PID. We can use this to construct some examples
of injective modules.
Examples 4.3.2.
1. Let R be a subring of a ﬁeld F and regard F as an R-module in the natural
way. Evidently F is a divisible R-module. Hence, if K is any R-submodule of F, then F/K
is a divisible R-module. In particular, Q is an injective Z-module which is not projective.
2. Let D be a PID, F its ﬁeld of fractions. If r ∈D, then the D-module F/rD is divisible and
hence is injective by Theorem 4.3.6.
Our next objective is to prove that any module can be embedded in an injective module, that
is, given any M there exists an exact sequence 0 →M
i→Q with Q is injective. The ﬁrst step in
the proof we shall give is as follows.
Lemma 4.3.7. Any abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group (= a divisible Z-module).
Proof. First let F be a free abelian group with base {xα} and F ′ the vector space over Q with {xα}
as base. Then F is embedded in F ′ and it is clear that F ′ is divisible. Now let M be an arbitrary
abelian group. Then M is isomorphic to a factor group F/K of a free abelian group F. Hence,
F ′/K is a divisible group and F/K ∼= M is a subgroup.
An immediate consequence of this and Theorem 4.3.6 is the next corollary.
Corollary 4.3.8. Any Z-module can be embedded in an injective Z-module.
Now for an arbitrary R-module M, we have the isomorphism of M onto homR(R, M) which
maps an element x ∈M into the homomorphism fx such that 1 7→x. This is an R-isomorphism
if we make homR(R, M) into a right R-module by deﬁning fa, a ∈R, by (fa)(b) = f(ab). Also
homZ(R, M) is a right R-module using this deﬁnition of fa. Clearly homR(R, M) is a submod-
ule of homZ(R, M). Since M is isomorphic to homR(R, M), we have an embedding of M in
homZ(R, M). Now embed M in an injective Z-module Q, which can be done by the foregoing
corollary. Then we have an embedding of homZ(R, Q) as R-modules. This gives an embedding of
M in an injective R-module, since we have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.3.9. If Q is an injective Z-module, then homZ(R, Q) is an injective R-module.
Proof. We must show that if 0 →N′
f→N is an exact sequence of R-modules, then
homR(N, homZ(R, Q))
f∗
→homR(N′, homZ(R, Q)) →0
is exact, where f∗= homR(f, homZ(R, Q)). We have an isomorphism
ϕN : homZ(N ⊗R R, Q) →homR(N, homZ(R, Q))
and the deﬁnition shows that this is “natural” in N. Since the isomorphism of N ⊗R R onto N
such that y ⊗1 7→y is natural in N, we have an isomorphism
ψN : homZ(N, Q) →homR(N, homZ(R, Q))

The foregoing lemma completes the proof of the embedding theorem.
Theorem 4.3.10. Any module can be embedded in an injective module.
The proof we have given is due to B. Eckmann and A. Schöpf. We can apply the theorem to
complete the following characterization of injectives, which we idicated earlier.
Theorem 4.3.11. The following properties of a module Q are equivalent:
(i) Q is injective.
(ii) Any short exact sequence 0 →Q →M →N →0 splits.
(iii) Q is a direct summand of every module containing it as a submodule.
Proof. We leave the proof of (i) ⇒(ii) as an exercise. Conversely, suppose any short exact se-
quence 0 →Q →M →N →0 splits. By the embedding theorem we have an exact sequence
0 →Q
i→M where M is injective. Then we have the short exact sequence 0 →Q

Project 22 (Injective hull). It is possible to prove a sharper result than Theorem 4.3.10, namely that there
is a minimal injective R-module H containing M in the sense that any injective map of M into an injective
R-module Q factor through H. More precisely, show that if M ⊆Q for an injective R-module Q then there
is an injection i : H →Q that restricts to the identity map on M; using i to identify H as a subset of Q we
have M ⊆H ⊆Q. This module H is called the injective hull or injective envelope of M. For example,
the injective hull of Z is Q, and the injective hull of any ﬁeld is itself. Furthermore, prove that:
(a) The injective hull of an injective module is itself.
(b) The injective hull of an integral domain is its ﬁeld of fractions.

Modules over a PID
Our main goal of this section is to prove the structure theorem for modules over a PID.
Theorem 4.4.1. Let R be a PID and suppose that M is a ﬁnitely generated R-module. Then there
is an integer r ≥0 and nonzero elements d1, . . . , dk ∈R with d1|d2, . . . , dk−1|dk such that
M ∼= R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z
}
r copies
⊕R/Rd1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rdk.
Moreover, if N is another ﬁnitely generated R-module and
N ∼= R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z
}
¯r copies
⊕R/R ¯d1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/R ¯d¯k,
where ¯di| ¯di+1, then M and N are isomorphic as R-modules if and only if r = ¯r, k = ¯k and di and
¯di are associates for i = 1, . . . , k.
Note that we cannot assert more than that di and ¯di are associates, for if d and ¯d are associates,
then R/Rd ∼= R/R ¯d.
Since abelian groups are equivalent to Z-modules, this theorem can be stated as “A ﬁnitely
generated Z-module is a direct sum of cyclic modules”. Actually, the theorem was more precise in
that it actually classiﬁed all ﬁnitely generated Z-modules up to isomorphism. That is, one has

120
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Theorem 4.4.2. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated Z-module. Then there are nonnegative integers
r ≥0, d1, . . . , dk > 0 where d1|d2, . . . , dk−1|dk such that
M ∼= Z ⊕· · · ⊕Z
|
{z

⊕Z/d1Z ⊕· · · ⊕Z/dkZ.
Moreover, if N is another ﬁnitely generated Z-module and
N ∼= Z ⊕· · · ⊕Z
|
{z
}
¯r copies
⊕Z/ ¯d1Z ⊕· · · ⊕Z/ ¯d¯kZ,
where ¯di| ¯di+1, then M and N are isomorphic if and only if r = ¯r, k = ¯k and di = ¯di for
i = 1, . . . , k. r is called the rank or torsion-free rank of M and d1, . . . , dk are called the invariant
factors of M.
Therefore, we have a major theorem on abelian groups:
Corollary 4.4.3. A ﬁnitely generated abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups.
The strategy of our proof is the following. First we observe that even with no hypothesis on
the ring R, the following statements are equivalent:
(i) M is a ﬁnitely generated R-module and can be generated by s elements.
(ii) Let F = Rx1 + · · · + Rxs be a free R-module with s free generators. Then there is an exact
sequence of R-modules 0
/ K
/ F
φ
/ M
/ 0 where K = ker φ.
(iii) M ∼= F/K where F is a free R-module on s free generators and K is an R-submodule of F.
Now let us suppose that R is commutative and we have a free R-module F and a submodule
K where F = Rx1 + · · · + Rxr + Ry1 + · · · + Ryk and K = d1Ry1 + · · · + dkRyk. Then it is easy
to see that
F/K ∼= R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z
}
r copies
⊕R/Rd1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rdk
since Rxi ∼= R and Ryi/diRyi ∼= R/Rdi.
If we have an arbitrary commutative ring R, K may not have an appropriate form. Moreover,
no change of basis may be possible which changes K to the appropriate form. However, in case
R is a PID, it is always possible to choose a basis for F and a basis for K (which will also be
free) so that the above situation exists. In addition, it will be possible to choose d1, . . . , dk so that
d1|d2, . . . , dk−1|dk. This will yield the desired structure theorem for ﬁnitely generated modules
over R.
The proof will consist of two stages.
Stage I.
We prove an appropriate theorem about m × n matrices over a PID R.
Stage II.
We show that theorem about m × n matrices proved in Stage I can be translated into a
theorem about modules—namely the structure theorem for modules over a PID.
We shall now prove a theorem which says that any m × n matrix [A] over a PID R can be
transformed to a diagonal matrix by a transformation
[A] →[P][A][Q]
where [P] and [Q] are appropriate invertible matrices over R.
Let R be a ring and GLn(R) the group of invertible n × n matrices over R. It is called the
general linear group over R. Moreover, if R is commutative, then
GLn(R) = {A ∈Mn(R) : det A is a unit in R}.

In other words, the entries of A and of PA generate the same ideal in R.
3. If E is the elementary matrix obtained by interchanging the i-th and j-th rows of the identity
matrix Im and A is an m × n matrix, then E ∈GLm(R) and EA is the matrix obtained by
interchanging the i-th and j-th rows of A.
4. If E is the elementary matrix obtained by multiplying the i-th row of the identity matrix Im
by a unit c ∈R and A is an m×n matrix, then E ∈GLm(R) and EA is the matrix obtained
by multiplying the i-th row of A by c.
5. If E is the elementary matrix obtained by adding c times the j-th row of Im to the i-th row
of Im and A is an m × n matrix, then E ∈GLm(R) and EA is the matrix obtained by
adding c times the j-th row of A to the i-th row of A.
6. The analogues of (1)–(5) hold for right multiplications and column transformations.

(2) The entries bij of PA are R-linear combinations of the aij, so P Rbij ⊆P Raij. But since
P −1(PA) = A the entries aij of A are R-linear combinations of bij, so P Raij ⊆P Rbij.
(3), (4), (5) and (6) are clear.
Remark. Passing from A to EA as in (3), (4) and (5) of the above theorem are called elementary
row transformations of A. Elementary column transformations of A are deﬁned similarly.
Recall that if R is a PID and a, b ∈R, then Ra + Rb = Rc where c = gcd(a, b). Moreover, if we
let a = cx and b = cy, then gcd(x, y) = 1, or Rx + Ry = R. More generally, Ra1 + · · · + Ran = Rd
where d = gcd(a1, . . . , an) and if ai = dbi, then Rb1 + · · · + Rbn = R. In UFD, gcd(a, b) = 1 does
not imply Ra + Rb = R. For example, R = F[x, y], where F is a ﬁeld, and gcd(x, y) = 1.

Before we can use our result on matrices to show that a ﬁnitely generated module over a PID
R is a direct sum of cyclic modules, we need to show that every submodule of Rn = R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z
}
n
is ﬁnitely generated. In fact we shall show that every submodule of Rn is free of rank ≤n.
Theorem 4.4.7. Let R be a ring and let M = Rx1 + · · · + Rxm and N = Ry1 + · · · + Ryn be free
R-modules of rank m and n, respectively. Suppose 0 →M
j→P
π→N →0 is an exact sequence of
R-modules. Then P is a free R-module of rank m + n.
Proof. It follows from Theorem 4.3.3.
Theorem 4.4.8. If R is a PID and P is a submodule of Rn = R ⊕· · · ⊕R
|
{z
}
n
, then P is free of
rank ≤n.
Proof. We shall use induction on n. For n = 1, we have P is a submodule of R, i.e. P is an ideal
of R, so P = Rx for some x ∈R. If x = 0, P = 0, so P is free of rank 0; if x ̸= 0, Rx ∼= R
as a left R-module, so P is free of rank 1. Next suppose n > 1 and the theorem is true for free
R-submodules of rank < n. Let
Rn = Rx1 ⊕· · · ⊕Rxn = (Rx1 ⊕· · · ⊕Rxn−1) ⊕Rxn.
Then we have an exact sequence
0 →Rx1 ⊕· · · ⊕Rxn−1
i→Rn
π→Rxn →0
where i is the inclusion map and π is the projection onto the last factor. Let M = (Rx1 ⊕· · · ⊕
Rxn−1) ∩P ⊆Rx1 ⊕· · · ⊕Rxn−1 and N = π(P) ⊆Rxn. Then
0 →M
i→P
π|P
→N →0
is an exact sequence of R-modules. M is a submodule of Rn−1 and N is a submodule of Rxn ∼= R,
so both are free of ranks ≤n −1 and 1, respectively. Hence, P is free of rank ≤n = (n −1) + 1
by Theorem 4.4.7.
Theorem 4.4.9. Let R be a PID and A a ﬁnitely generated R-module. Then A is a direct sum of
cyclic R-modules. More precisely,
A ∼= R ⊕· · · ⊕R

{z

where r ≥0 and d1, . . . , dk are nonzero elements of R and d1 | d2, . . . , dk−1 | dk.

4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Proof. Since A is ﬁnitely generated, there is an exact sequence 0 →N →M →A →0 where
M = Rx1 + . . . Rxn is free of ﬁnite rank n and N is a submodule of M. By Theorem 4.4.8, N is
ﬁnitely generated, say by
y1 = a11x1 + a21x2 + · · · + an1xn
y2 = a12x1 + a22x2 + · · · + an2xn
...
ym = a1mx1 + a2mx2 + · · · + anmxn.
Let ¯
M = Rn be the space of n × 1 column vector over R and let ¯N be the R-submodule of ¯

generated by the columns of the n × m matrix
[ ¯N] =

and it is clear that α(N) = ¯N. Hence, we have R-module isomorphisms
A ∼= M/N ∼= α(M)/α(N) = ¯

By Theorem 4.4.6, there are matrices [P] ∈GLn(R) and [Q] ∈GLm(R) such that

4.4. Modules over a PID
127
Example 4.4.1. Let A be the Z-module generated by x, y and z with the relations
x + y = 0
and
x −y + 2z = 0.
Express A as a direct sum of cyclic modules.
Solution. Observe that A = {(x, y, z) ∈Z3 : x + y = 0 and x −y + 2z = 0}. Consider the exact
sequence
0
/ N = Z(x + y) + Z(x −y + 2z)
/ Zx ⊕Zy ⊕Zz
/ A

Then y1 = x + y and y2 = x −y + 2z, so

Thus, U = Zx ⊕Z(2y). Hence,
A ∼= M/U = (Zx ⊕Zy ⊕Zz)/(Zx ⊕Z(2y)) ∼= {0} ⊕Z2 ⊕Zz ∼= Z2 ⊕Z
as desired.
Our next goal is to show that the direct summands which occur in the above decomposition
are unique up to isomorphism. This does NOT mean that the actual summands which occur are
unique. For example, suppose R = Z and
A = Z ⊕Z ⊕Z3 ⊕Z3 ∼= Zx1 ⊕Zx2 ⊕Zy1 ⊕Zy2
where Zx1 and Zx2 are free summands and 3y1 = 3y2 = 0. Then we can also write
A = Z(x1 + 2x2 + y2) ⊕Zx2 ⊕Z(2y1 + y2) ⊕Z(y1 + y2) ∼= Z ⊕Z ⊕Z3 ⊕Z3
In the ﬁrst case, the direct summands are
Zx1 ∼= Z, Zx2 ∼= Z, Zy1 ∼= Z3, Zy2 ∼= Z3.
In the second case, the direct summands are
Z(x1 + 2x2 + y2) ∼= Z, Zx2 ∼= Z, Z(2y1 + y2) ∼= Z3, Z(y1 + y2) ∼= Z3.
Then the summands which occurs are distinct submodules in the two cases, but the isomorphism
classes of summands are the same, namely Z, Z, Z3 and Z3.
As a preparation for proving uniqueness, we shall need the concept of a torsion element.
Let R be an integral domain and M an R-module. An m ∈M is called a torsion element
of M if there is a nonzero r ∈R such that rm = 0. Let τ(M) denote the set of torsion elements
of R, called the torsion submodule of M. If τ(M) = 0, M is said to be a torsion free R-module.
Theorem 4.4.10. Let R be an integral domain and M an R-module. Then
1. τ(M) is a submodule of M.
2. τ(M/τ(M)) = 0.

128
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Proof. (1) The only problem in showing that τ(M) is a submodule of M is in showing that τ(M)
is closed under addition. Suppose x, y ∈τ(M). Then there exist nonzero elements r, s ∈R such
that rx = 0 and sy = 0. Since R is an integral domain, rs ̸= 0. But
rs(x + y) = s(rx) + r(sy) = 0 + 0 = 0.
Hence, x + y ∈τ(M).
(2) Suppose x + τ(M) ∈τ(M/τ(M)). Then there is a nonzero r ∈R such that
r(x + τ(M)) = rx + τ(M) = 0 + τ(M),
i.e., rx ∈τ(M). Thus, there is a nonzero s ∈R such that s(rx) = 0, so sr ̸= 0 and (sr)x = 0.
Hence, x ∈τ(M), so τ(M/τ(M)) = 0.
Remarks.
1. If R is not an integral domain, then the torsion elements of an R-module M may
not form a submodule, even if R is commutative. For example, let R = F × F where F is a
ﬁeld and let M = R = F × F. Then the torsion elements of M are all elements of the form
(a, 0) or (0, b). But if a, b ̸= 0, (a, b) = (a, 0) + (0, b) is not a torsion element.
2. If R is not commutative, then the torsion elements of an R-module M may not form a
submodule, even if R has no zero divisors. For example, there exists a non-commutative do-
main R (such as the polynomial rings over the quaternion ring) such that for some nonzero
x, y ∈R, Rx ∩Ry = 0. In other words, x and y have no common left multiple except 0. For
such an R, x and y, let M = R/Rx as a left R-module. Then
(a) y+Rx is not a torsion element of M, for 0 = r(y+Rx) = ry+Rx, so ry ∈Rx∩Ry = 0.
Thus, ry = 0, so r = 0.
(b) 1+Rx is a torsion element of M since x(1+Rx) = x+Rx = 0. Since 1+Rx generates
M = R/Rx as a left R-module, it follows that the torsion elements of M do not form
a submodule.
Theorem 4.4.11. Let R be a PID and let p be an irreducible element of R.
1. Rp is a maximal ideal of R, i.e., R/Rp is a ﬁeld.
2. If d ∈R and p ∤d, then p(R/Rd) = R/Rd.
3. If d ∈R and p | d, then p(R/Rd) = Rp/Rd ∼= R/R(d/p).
Proof. (1) Suppose Rp is not a maximal ideal and let Rp ⊂Rx ⊂R. Then p = rx where neither r
nor x is a unit of R, which contradicts the hypothesis that p is irreducible.
(2) Since Rp is a maximal ideal and p ∤d, Rp + Rd = R. Thus, we can choose r, s ∈R with
rp + sd = 1. Then for any x ∈R, x + Rd = (rp + sd)x + Rd = prx + Rd = p(rx + Rd). Hence,
p(R/Rd) = R/Rd.
(3) Since p | d, Rd ⊂Rp. The multiplication by p deﬁnes an onto R-module homomorphism
ϕp : R →Rp/Rd where ϕp(x) = xp + Rd. It is easy to verify that ker ϕp = R(d/p). Hence, we
have the theorem.
Theorem 4.4.12. Let R be a PID and suppose d1, . . . , dk, e1, . . . , em are nonzero nonunits of R,
where d1 | d2, . . . , dk−1 | dk, e1 | e2, . . . , em−1 | em. Suppose
A = R/Rd1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rdk ∼= R/Re1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rem = B.
Then k = m and R/Rdi ∼= R/Rei for i = 1, . . . , m. In particular, di and ei are associate for
i = 1, . . . , m.
Proof. Let p be a prime of R which divides d1. Then p | di for all i = 1, . . . , k, so
(R/Rdi)/p(R/Rdi) = (R/Rdi)/(Rp/Rdi) ∼= R/Rp

for all i = 1, . . . , k. Thus, A/pA ∼= R/Rp ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rp

. In other words, A/pA is a vector space
over the ﬁeld R/Rp of dimension k.
Note that since p(M/pM) = pM/pM = 0 for any R-
module M, M/pM may be considered as an R/Rp module, i.e., as a vector space over R/Rp.
Since A ∼= B, A/pA ∼= B/pB since any isomorphism φ : A →B carries pA onto pB. But since
B is generated as an R/Rp-module by ≤m elements. Thus,
m ≥dimR/Rp(B/pB) = dimR/Rp(A/pA) = k.
By symmetry, k ≥m. Hence, m = k.
We now show that R/Rdi ∼= R/Rei by induction on the number n of prime divisors of d1 · · · dk.
E.g., for d1 . . . dk = pα1
1 . . . pαr
r , we have n = α1 + · · · + αr. If n = 1, then k = 1 and A = R/Rd1 ∼=
R/Re1 = B. For inductive step, let p be a prime divisor of d1 and hence of d2, . . . , dk. Then
A/pA ∼= R/Rp ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rp

}
k
as above. Suppose p ∤e1. Then p(R/Re1) = R/Re1, by Theorem
4.4.11, so (R/Re1)/p(R/Re1) = 0. Thus,
B/pB = (R/Re1)/p(R/Re1) ⊕· · · ⊕(R/Rek)/p(R/Rek)
∼= (R/Re2)/p(R/Re2) ⊕· · · ⊕(R/Rek)/p(R/Rek)
is generated by ≤k −1 elements. Hence, dimR/Rp(B/pB) ≤k −1 and dimR/Rp(A/pA) = k, a
contradiction, since A/pA ∼= B/pB as above. Then p | e1, so p | ei for all i = 1, . . . , k. By Theorem
4.4.11, we have isomorphisms
R/R(d1/p) ⊕· · · ⊕R/R(dk/p) ∼= p(R/Rd1) ⊕· · · ⊕p(R/Rdk)
= pA ∼= pB ∼= p(R/Re1) ⊕· · · ⊕p(R/Rek)
∼= R/R(e1/p) ⊕· · · ⊕R/R(ek/p).
Now the number of prime factors of (d1/p) · · · (dk/p) is strictly less than the number of prime
factors of d1 · · · dk. Hence, the inductive hypothesis applies to the isomorphism
R/R(d1/p) ⊕· · · ⊕R/R(dk/p) ∼= R/R(e1/p) ⊕· · · ⊕R/R(ek/p).
Thus, we may conclude that R/R(di/p) ∼= R/R(ei/p) for i = 1, . . . , k.
Note that for any ideal I of R, I = ann(R/I) = {r ∈R : r(R/I) = 0}. Hence, R/I ∼= R/J if
and only if I = ann(R/I) ∼= ann(R/J) = J (as submodules of R), and so
R/R(di/p) ∼= R/R(ei/p) ⇔R(di/p) ∼= R(ei/p) ⇔Rdi ∼= Rei ⇔R/Rdi ∼= R/Rei.
Therefore, R/Rdi ∼= R/Rei for i = 1, . . . , k and the theorem is proved.

4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Proof. We ﬁrst observe that the torsion submodules of A and B are
τ(A) = R/Rd1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rdk and τ(B) = R/Re1 ⊕· · · ⊕R/Rem.
Also,
A/τ(A) = R ⊕· · · ⊕R

and B/τ(B) = R ⊕· · · ⊕R

Now if φ : A →B is an isomorphism, it is easy to see that φ(τ(A)) = τ(B), so φ induces
isomorphisms
φ|τ(A) : τ(A) →τ(B) and ˆφ : A/τ(A) →B/τ(B).
In particular, ˆφ is an isomorphism between a free R-module of rank r and one of rank s. Hence,
r = s by Theorem 4.2.6. Finally, Theorem 4.4.12 applies to the isomorphism between τ(A) and
τ(B) and shows that k = m and R/Rdi ∼= R/Rei for all i = 1, . . . , k.

that D3/K ∼= D/(g1) ⊕· · · ⊕D/(gr).
4.5
Noetherian Rings
In the proof of Theorem 2.4.11 (every PID is a UFD), the fact that “every ideal of R is principal”
is used to argue that there is no inﬁnite strictly increasing chain of ideals in R. A ring with this
property is called a Noetherian ring, in honor of Emmy Noether, who inaugurated the use of chain
condition in algebra. Noetherian rings are of the utmost importance in algebraic geometry and
algebraic number theory. One reason for this is that for any ﬁeld F, F[x1, . . . , xn], n ≥2, is
Noetherian domain but not a PID. We shall study Noetherian rings in this section.
A partially ordered set Σ has the ascending chain condition (a.c.c.) if every chain
s1 ≤s2 ≤. . .

4.5. Noetherian Rings
131
eventually breaks off, that is, sk = sk+1 = . . . for some k. This is a ﬁniteness condition in logic
that allows arguments by induction, even when the partially ordered set Σ is inﬁnite. It is easy to
see that a partially ordered set Σ has the a.c.c. if and only if every nonempty subset S ⊂Σ has a
maximal element: If ∅̸= S ⊂Σ does not have a maximal element, then choose s1 ∈S, and for
each sk, an element sk+1 with sk < sk+1, thus contradicting the a.c.c..
Theorem 4.5.1. Let R be a ring. The following three conditions are equivalent.
(i) The set Σ of left ideals of R has the a.c.c.; in other words, every increasing chain of left ideals
I1 ⊂I2 ⊂. . . eventually stops, that is Ik = Ik+1 = . . . for some k.
(ii) Every nonempty set S of left ideals has a maximal element.
(iii) Every left ideal I ⊂R is ﬁnitely generated.
If one of these conditions hold, then R is Noetherian (named after E. Noether).
Proof. Here (i) ⇔(ii) is the purely logical statement about partially ordered sets already dis-
cussed, whereas (i) or (ii) ⇔(iii) is directly concerned with rings and ideals.
(i) ⇒(iii). Pick f1 ∈I, then if possible f2 ∈I∖(f1), and so on. At each step, if I ̸= (f1, . . . , fk),
pick fk+1 ∈I ∖(f1, . . . , fk). Then by the a.c.c. (i), the chain of ideals
(f1) ⊂(f1, f2) ⊂· · · ⊂(f1, . . . , fk) ⊂· · ·
must break off at some stage, and this can only happen if (f1, . . . , fk) = I for some k. This proof
involves an implicit appeal to the axiom of choice. It is perhaps cleaner to do (i) ⇒(ii) purely in
set theory, then argue as follows.
(ii) ⇒(iii). Let I be a left ideal of R and consider the set S of ﬁnitely generated left ideals
contained in I. Then {0} ∈S , so that S has a maximal element J by (ii). But then J = I,
since any element f ∈I ∖J would give rise to a strictly bigger ﬁnitely generated left ideal
J ⊂(J, f) ⊆I.
(iii) ⇒(i). Let I1 ⊂I2 ⊂. . . be an increasing chain of left ideals. Then J = S
k Ik is again an
ideal. If J is ﬁnitely generated then J = (f1, . . . , fn) and each fi ∈Iki, so that setting k = max ki
gives J = Ik and the chain stops.
Remarks.
1. Every PID is Noetherian. Hence, we may consider a Noetherian ring as a gener-
alization of a PID.
2. Most rings of interest are Noetherian this is a very convenient condition to work with. At
ﬁrst sight, more concrete conditions (such as R ﬁnitely generated over k or over Z) might
seem more attractive, but as a rule, the Noetherian condition is both more general and more
practical to work with.
3. The descending chain condition (d.c.c.) on a partially ordered set is deﬁned in a similar
way. A ring whose ideals satisfy the d.c.c. is called an Artinian ring. This is also a very
important notion, but is more special: the d.c.c. for rings turns out to be very much stronger
than the a.c.c. (and implies it). We shall discuss this kind of rings in the next section.
Example 4.5.1. Z is Noetherian but not Artinian since Z ⊃pZ ⊃p2Z ⊃. . . , p prime, is a
decreasing chain which does not stop.
Examples 4.5.2. Here are three examples of non-Noetherian rings. Let k be a ﬁeld.
1. The polynomial ring k[x1, . . . , xn, . . . ] in an inﬁnite number of indeterminates is obviously
non-Noetherian.
2. Consider the ring A1 of polynomials in x, y of the form f(x, y) = a + xg(x, y) with a a
constant and g ∈k[x, y]; that is, f involves no pure power yj of y with j > 0. In other
words,
A1 =
n
f(x, y) =
X
aijxiyj : i, j ≥0 and i > 0 if j ̸= 0
o
= k[x, xy, xy2, . . . , xyn, . . . ] ⊂k[x, y].

132
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
It is clear that (x, xy, xy2, . . . ) is a maximal ideal of A1, and is not ﬁnitely generated. (It
looks as if it should be generated by x, but, of course, y, y2, . . . are not elements of the ring
A1.) Thus, A1 is not Noetherian.
3. A rather similar example is the ring A2 of polynomials in x, y, y−1 of the form g(x, y) +
xh(x, y, y−1); that is,
A2 =
n
f(x, y) =
X
aijxiyj : i ≥0, and j ≥0 if i = 0
o
= k[x, y, x/y, x/y2, . . . , x/yn, . . . ].
In this ring x = (x/y) · y, and x/y = (x/y2) · y, etc., so that the element x does not have a
factorization into irreducibles and
(x) ⊂(x/y) ⊂(x/y2) ⊂· · ·
is an inﬁnite ascending chain.
Let R be a ring. An R-module M is Noetherian if the submodules of M have the a.c.c., that
is, any increasing chain M1 ⊂M2 ⊂. . . ⊂Mk ⊂. . . of submodules eventually stops. Just as
before, it is equivalent to say that any nonempty set of submodules of M has a maximal element,
or that every submodule of M is ﬁnitely generated.
Theorem 4.5.2. Let 0
/ L
α
/ M
β
/ N
/ 0 be an exact sequence of R-modules. Then
M is Noetherian if and only if L and N are.
Proof. Obviously, the condition is necessary. Suppose M1 ⊂M2 ⊂. . . is an increasing chain of
submodules of M; then identifying α(L) with L and taking intersection gives a chain
L ∩M1 ⊂L ∩M2 ⊂. . .
of submodules of L and applying β gives a chain β(M1) ⊂β(M2) ⊂. . . of submodules of N. Each
of these two chains eventually stops, by the assumption on L and N, so that we need to prove the
following statement:
Lemma 4.5.3. For submodules, M1 ⊂M2 ⊂M, if L ∩M1 = L ∩M2 and β(M1) = β(M2), then
M1 = M2.
Proof. Indeed, if m ∈M2, then β(m) ∈β(M2) = β(M1), so that there is an n ∈M1 such that
β(m) = β(n). Then β(m −n) = 0, so that m −n ∈M2 ∩ker β = M1 ∩ker β. Hence, m ∈M1.
We record consequences of this theorem in:
Corollary 4.5.4. Let M be an R-modules and N an R-submodule of M. Then M is Noetherian if
and only if N and M/N are.
Corollary 4.5.5.
1. If Mi are Noetherian modules, i = 1, . . . , r, then
r
M
i=1
Mi is Noetherian.
2. If R is a Noetherian ring, then an R-module M is Noetherian if and only if it is ﬁnitely
generated over R.
3. If R is a Noetherian ring and M is a ﬁnitely generated R-module, then any submodule
N ⊂M is again ﬁnitely generated.
4. If R is a Noetherian ring and ϕ : R →B is a ring homomorphism such that B is a ﬁnitely
generated R-module, then B is a Noetherian ring. In particular, a homomorphic image of a
Noetherian ring is a Noetherian ring.

4.5. Noetherian Rings
133
Proof. (1) A direct sum M1 ⊕M2 is a particular case of an exact sequence, so that the previous
proves (1) when r = 2. The case r > 2 follows by an easy induction.
(2) If M is ﬁnitely generated then there is a surjective homomorphism Rr →M →0 for some
r, so that M is a quotient M ∼= Rr/N for some submodule N ⊂Rr; now Rr is a Noetherian
module by (1), so M Noetherian follows by the implication ⇒of the above theorem. Conversely,
M Noetherian obviously implies M is ﬁnitely generated.
(3) This just uses the previous implication: M ﬁnitely generated and R Noetherian implies that
M is Noetherian, so that N is Noetherian, which implies that N is a ﬁnitely generated R-module.
(4) B is Noetherian as an R-module; but left ideals of B are submodules of B as an R-submodule,
so that B is a Noetherian ring.
The following result provides many examples of Noetherian rings, and is the main motivation
behind the use of the a.c.c. in commutative algebra. Note that in Hilbert’s day, a “basis” of a
module meant simply a family of generators.
Theorem 4.5.6. [Hilbert Basis Theorem] If R is a commutative Noetherian ring, then so is the
polynomial ring R[x].
Proof. We shall prove that any ideal I ⊂R[x] is ﬁnitely generated. For this, deﬁne auxiliary sets
Jn ⊂R by
Jn = {a ∈R : there exists f ∈I such that f(x) = axn + bn−1xn−1 + · · · + b1x + b0}.
In other words, Jn is the set of leading coefﬁcients of elements of I of degree n ≥0. Then it is
easy to check that Jn is an ideal (using the fact that I is an ideal), and that Jn ⊂Jn+1 (because
for f ∈I, also xf ∈I), and therefore
J0 ⊆J1 ⊆J2 ⊆. . .
is an increasing chain of ideals. Using the assumption that R is Noetherian, we deduce that
Jn = Jn+1 = . . . for some n.
For each m ≤n, the ideal Jm ⊂R is ﬁnitely generated, say Jm = (am,1, . . . , am,rm); and by
deﬁnition of Jm, for each am,j with 1 ≤j ≤rm there is a polynomial fm,j ∈I of degree m having
the leading coefﬁcient am,j. This allows us to write down a ﬁnite set
S = {fm,j}0≤m≤n,1≤j≤rm
of elements of I.
We now claim that S generates I. Indeed, for any polynomial f(x) ∈I, if f(x) has degree m
then its leading coefﬁcient a is in Jm, hence if m ≥n, then a ∈Jm = Jn, so that a =
P bian,i
with bi ∈R and f(x) −P bixm−nfn,i(x) has degree < m; similarly, if m ≤n, then a ∈Jm, so that
a = P biam,i with bi ∈R and f(x) −P bifm,i(x) has degree < m. By induction on m, it follows
that f can be written as a linear combination of the ﬁnitely many elements in S. This proves that
any ideal of R[x] is ﬁnitely generated.
Corollary 4.5.7. If R is a commutative Noetherian ring and ϕ : R →B is a ring homomorphism
such that B is a commutative ﬁnitely generated extension ring of ϕ(R), then B is Noetherian.
Proof. The assumption is that B is a quotient of a polynomial ring, B ∼= R[x1, . . . , xn]/I for
some ideal I. Now by Hilbert Basis Theorem and an obvious induction, R Noetherian implies
that so is R[x1, . . . , xn], and by Corollary 4.5.5, (4), R[x1, . . . , xn] is Noetherian implies that so is
R[x1, . . . , xn]/I.

4.6
Artinian Rings
In this section, we study deeper commutative ring theory. Our main goal is to show that any ﬁnite
commutative ring is a direct product of a ﬁnite number of local rings. However, we present results
on more a general ring, called an “Artinian ring”.
The Jacobson radical of a ring R is the intersection of all maximal ideals of R and is denoted
by Jac R. Note that if R is a local ring with unique maximal ideal M, then Jac R = M. Let R be a
ring. An element a ∈R is nilpotent if an = 0 for some n ∈N. The set of all nilpotent elements in
a commutative ring R is an ideal, called the nilradical of R. It is also clear that every prime ideal
in a commutative ring contains the nilradical.
Theorem 4.6.1. Let J be the Jacobson radical of a commutative ring R.
1. If I is a proper ideal of R, then so is the ideal generated by I and J.
2. The Jacobson radical contains the nilradical of R.
3. For x ∈R, x ∈J if and only if 1 −rx is a unit for all r ∈R. In partucular, if R is a local
ring with unique maximal ideal M, then 1 −m is a unit in R for all m ∈M.
4. [Nakayama’s lemma] If M is any ﬁnitely generated R-module and JM = M, then M = {0}.
5. If M is ﬁnitely generated and M = N + IM for some ideal I ⊆J and submodule N of M,
then M = N.
6. Let I be an ideal in the Jacobson radical of R, and suppose that M is ﬁnitely generated. If
m1, . . . , mn have images in M/IM that generate it as an R-module, then m1, . . . , mn also
generate M as an R-module.
Proof. (1) If I is a proper ideal of R, then I is contained in some maximal ideal M of R. Since
J ⊆M, I ∪J ⊆M.
(2) Let a ∈R be nilpotent. Then an = 0 for some n ∈N. Since maximal ideals are prime and
an ∈M, so a ∈M.
(3) Suppose 1 −rx is not a unit for some r ∈R and let M be a maximal ideal containing 1 −rx.
Since 1 /∈M, rx /∈M, so x /∈M. But J ⊆M, it follows that x /∈J. Conversely, assume that
x /∈J. Then there is a maximal ideal M such that x /∈M. Thus, R = (x, M), so 1 = rx + m for
some r ∈R and m ∈M. Hence, 1 −rx = m ∈M which implies that 1 −rx is not a unit in R.
(4) Assume that M ̸= {0} and let n be the smallest positive integer such that M is generated by
n elements, say m1, . . . , mn. Since M = JM, we have
mn = r1m1 + · · · + rnmn
for some r1, . . . , rn ∈J.
Thus, (1 −rn)mn = r1m1 + · · · + rn−1mn−1. By (3), 1 −rn is a unit, so mn lies in the module
generated by m1, . . . , mn−1 which contradicts the minimality of n. Hence, M = {0}.
(5) Apply (4) to M/N.
(6) Apply (5) to N = P
i Rmi.

4.6. Artinian Rings
135
Remark. In the special case of a ﬁnitely generated module M over a local ring R with unique
maximal ideal J, the quotient M/JM is a vector space over the ﬁeld R/J. Statement (6) implies
that a basis of M/JM lifts to a minimal set of generators of M. Conversely, every minimal set
of generators of M is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an
invertible matrix with entries in the ring.
A ring whose ideals satisfy the descending chain condition (d.c.c.), i.e., whenever I1 ⊇I2 ⊇
. . . is a decreasing chain of ideals of R, then there is a positive integer m such that Ik = Im for
all k ≥m, is called an Artinian ring (named after E. Artin). Clearly, every ﬁnite ring is Artinian.
Also, it is immediate that every quotient ring of an Artinian ring is Artinian. Similar to Theorem
4.5.1, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.6.2. R is an Artinian ring if and only if every nonempty set S of ideals has a minimal
element.
An R-module M is said to be Artinian if it satisﬁes d.c.c. on submodules. Similar to Theorem
4.5.2, we have:
Theorem 4.6.3. Let 0
/ L
/ M
/ N
/ 0 be an exact sequence of R-modules. Then
M is an Artinian R-module if and only if L and N are.
Lemma 4.6.4. Let M be a maximal ideal of the commutative ring R and suppose that Mm = {0}
for some m ∈N. Then R is Noetherian if and only if R is Artinian.
Proof. Observe that each successive quotient Mi/Mi+1, i = 0, 1, . . . , m −1, in the ﬁltration R ⊇
M ⊇M2 ⊇· · · ⊇Mm−1 ⊇Mm = {0} is a module over the ﬁeld F = R/M. Consider the exact
sequence 0
/ M
/ R
/ R/M
/ 0 of R-modules. Assume that R is Noetherian. By
Theorem 4.5.1, M and R/M is Noetherian. Thus, R/M and M are Artinian by Exercise 4.6 (2).
Hence, it follows from Theorem 4.6.3 that R is Artinian. The converse is proved in the same
way.
Lemma 4.6.5. Let R be a commutative ring and P a prime ideal of R. If I and J are ideals of R
such that P ⊇I ∩J, then I ⊆P or J ⊆P.
Proof. Assume that I ⊈P and J ⊈P. Let x ∈I, /∈P and y ∈J, /∈P. Then xy ∈I ∩J. Since x
and y are not in P and P is a prime ideal, xy /∈P which contradicts P ⊇I ∩J.
Now, we are ready to prove our main results.
Theorem 4.6.6. Let R be a commutative Artinian ring.
1. There are only ﬁnitely many maximal ideals in R.
2. The quotient R/(Jac R) is a direct product of a ﬁnite number of ﬁelds. More precisely, if
M1, . . . , Mn are ﬁnitely many maximal ideals in R, then
R/(Jac R) ∼= k1 × · · · × kn,
where ki is the ﬁeld R/Mi for all i ∈{1, . . . , n}.
3. Every prime ideal of R is maximal. The Jacobson radical of R equals the nilradical of R and
(Jac R)m = {0} for some m ∈N.
4. The ring R is isomorphic to the direct product of a ﬁnite number of Artinian local rings.
5. Every Artinian ring is Noetherian.

4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Proof. (1) Let S be the set of all ideals of R that are the intersection of a ﬁnite number of maximal
ideals. By Theorem 4.6.2, S has a minimal element, say M1 ∩· · · ∩Mn. Then for any maximal
ideal M, we have
M ∩M1 ∩· · · ∩Mn = M1 ∩· · · ∩Mn,
so M ⊇M1 ∩· · · ∩Mn. By Lemma 4.6.5, Mi ⊆M for some i. Since Mi and M are maximal,
Mi = M and hence M1, . . . , Mn are all maximal ideals of R.
(2) Since Mi + Mj = R for all i ̸= j and Jac R = M1 ∩· · · ∩Mn, the statement follows from the
Chinese remainder theorem applied to M1, . . . , Mn.
(3) We ﬁrst show that J = Jac R is nilpotent. By d.c.c., there is some m ∈N such that Jm = Jm+i
for all i ∈N. Assume that Jm ̸= {0}. Let S be the set of proper ideals I such that IJm ̸= {0}.
Then J ∈S . Let I0 be a minimal element of S . Thus, there is some x ∈I0 such that xJm ̸= {0}.
By minimality of I0, we have I0 = (x). Since ((x)J)Jm = xJm+1 = xJm, it follows that (x) = (x)J
by minimality of (x). By Nakayama’s lemma, (x) = {0}, a contradiction. Hence, Jm = {0}.
Since am ∈Jm = {0} for all a ∈J, every element of J is nilpotent. But J contains the
nilradical of R, so these two ideals are equal.
Let P be a prime ideal P of R. Then P contains the nilradical of R, so it contains J. Thus,
P/J is a prime ideal of R/J. By (2), R/J ∼= k1 × · · · × kn and thus a prime ideal of R/J consists
of the elements that are 0 in one of the components. In particular, such a prime ideal is also a
maximal ideal. Hence, P is maximal as desired.
(4) Let M1, M2, . . . , Mn be all the distinct maximal ideals of R and let J = Jac R and Jm = {0}
as in (3). Then

It follows from the Chinese remainder theorem that
R ∼= R/Mm

and each R/Mm

is an Artinian ring (because R is) with unique maximal ideal Mi/Mm

(5) From (4), it sufﬁces to prove that an Artinian local ring is Noetherian. Assume that R is an
Artinian with unique maximal ideal M. Then Jac R = M and Mm = {0} for some m ∈N. Thus,
the desired result follows from Lemma 4.6.4.
Corollary 4.6.7. Every ﬁnite commutative ring is a direct product of a ﬁnite number of local rings.

Symplectic Geometry
In this section, we see some applications of module theory, especially a free R-module over com-
mutative rings (§4.2), to obtain a structure theorem for ﬁnite dimensional symplectic spaces over
a local ring. In addition, we study the symplectic graphs over a commutative ring. This is the
work of the author published in Discrete Mathematics [32] and European Journal of Combina-
torics [33, 34]. However, we present a new combinatorial approach for obtaining the main theo-
rem (Theorem 4.7.5). In addition, we suggest a nice parallel project on studying the orthogonal
graphs over a ﬁnite commutative ring.
4.7.1
Symplectic Spaces
A bilinear form and a symplectic form for an R-module are deﬁned analogously as for a vector
space.
Let R be a commutative ring and V a left R-module. A bilinear form on V is a map β :
V × V →R which is R-linear in both variables. That is,
β(a⃗x + b⃗y, ⃗z) = aβ(⃗x, ⃗z) + bβ(⃗y, ⃗z) and β(⃗x, a⃗y + b⃗z) = aβ(⃗x, ⃗y) + bβ(⃗x, ⃗z)
for all ⃗x, ⃗y, ⃗z ∈V and a, b ∈R. A bilinear form β is called symplectic if ∀⃗x ∈V, β(⃗x, ⃗x) = 0.
Remark. If a bilinear form β is symplectic then
0 = β(⃗x + ⃗y, ⃗x + ⃗y) = β(⃗x, ⃗x) + β(⃗y, ⃗x) + β(⃗x, ⃗y) + β(⃗y, ⃗y) = β(⃗y, ⃗x) + β(⃗x, ⃗y)
for all ⃗x, ⃗y ∈V . That is, any symplectic bilinear form is also skew-symmetric.
For an R-submodule W of V , we write W ⊥(read “W perp”) for the submodule {⃗x ∈V : ∀⃗w ∈
W, β(⃗x, ⃗w) = 0}, called the orthogonal complement of W.
Example 4.7.1. Consider V = Z2 as a vector space over Z2. The bilinear form β(x, y) = xy is
skew-symmetric but not symplectic because β(1, 1) = 1 ̸= 0.
A bilinear form β : V × V →R is called regular or non-degenerate or non-singular if
1. ∀f ∈HomR(V, R), ∃⃗x0, ⃗y0 ∈V, f(⃗x) = β(⃗x0, ⃗x) and f(⃗x) = β(⃗x, ⃗y0).
2. If ⃗y ∈V and ∀⃗x ∈V, β(⃗x, ⃗y) = 0, then ⃗y = ⃗0. Similarly, if ⃗y ∈V and ∀⃗x ∈V, β(⃗y, ⃗x) = 0,
then ⃗y = ⃗0.
Example 4.7.2. Let p be a prime number and let R be the ring of integers modulo pn, Zpn, or the
ﬁeld of pn elements, Fpn, where n ∈N. For ν ≥1, let V denote the set of 2ν-tuples (a1, . . . , a2ν)
of elements in R. Deﬁne β : V × V →R by the product
β
 (a1, . . . , a2ν), (b1, . . . , b2ν)

= (a1, . . . , a2ν) K (b1, . . . , b2ν)t ,
where K =


2ν×2ν
and Iν is the ν × ν identity matrix, for all vectors (a1, . . . , a2ν),
(b1, . . . , b2ν) ∈V . Then β is a non-degenerate symplectic bilinear form.
Let R be a commutative ring and V a free R-module of rank n where n ≥2. Let β be a non-
degenerate symplectic bilinear form. We call the pair (V, β) a symplectic space. An R-module
automorphism σ on V is an isometry on V if β(σ(⃗x), σ(⃗y)) = β (⃗x, ⃗y) for all ⃗x, ⃗y ∈V . The group
of isometries on V is called the symplectic group of (V, β) over R and denoted by SpR(V ).
Let R be a commutative ring and (V, β) a symplectic space, where V is a free R-module of
rank n ≥2. A vector ⃗x in V is said to be unimodular if there is an f in HomR(V, R) with f(⃗x)
= 1; equivalently, if ⃗x = α1⃗b1 + · · · + αn⃗bn, where {⃗b1, . . . ,⃗bn} is a basis for V , then the ideal
(α1, . . . , αn) = R. If ⃗x is unimodular, then the line Rx is a free R-direct summand of rank one.

138
4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
A hyperbolic pair {⃗x, ⃗y} is a pair of unimodular vectors in V with the property that β (⃗x, ⃗y) = 1.
The module H = R⃗x ⊕R⃗y is called a hyperbolic plane.
Note that when R is a ﬁeld, unimodular vectors coincide with nonzero vectors. When R is a
local ring, we have a criterion to determine whether a vector in V is unimodular as follows.
Theorem 4.7.1. Let R be a local ring and (V, β) a symplectic space, where V is a free R-module
of rank n ≥2 with basis {⃗e1, . . . ,⃗en}. A vector ⃗x = a1⃗e1 + · · · + an⃗en in V is unimodular if and
only if ai is a unit of R for some i ∈{1, . . . , n}.
Proof. If some ai is a unit in R, then (a1, . . . , an) = R, so ⃗x is unimodular. Conversely, assume
that ⃗x is unimodular. Then there exists an f ∈V ∗such that 1 = f(⃗x) = a1f(⃗e1) + · · · + anf(⃗en).
Suppose that ai is not a unit in R for all i. Since R is a local ring, ai ∈M for all i, and thus
a1f(⃗e1) + · · · + anf(⃗en) ∈M. By Theorem 4.6.1 (3), 0 = 1 −(a1f(⃗e1) + · · · + anf(⃗en)) is a unit in
R, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ai is a unit of R for some i ∈{1, . . . , n}.
In addition, if R is a local ring, we show that the rank of symplectic space (V, β) must be even.
Let {⃗x, ⃗y} be a hyperbolic pair of unimodular vectors in V and H = R⃗x ⊕R⃗y the corresponding
hyperbolic plane. Then for ⃗z ∈V , it is easy to see that the vector ⃗w = ⃗z −β(⃗z, ⃗y)⃗x + β(⃗z, ⃗x)⃗y is in
H⊥, and so ⃗z can be decomposed as the sum
⃗z = ⃗w + (β(⃗z, ⃗y)⃗x −β(⃗z, ⃗x)⃗y)
of vectors in H⊥and H, respectively. Since β is non-degenerate, H ∩H⊥= {⃗0}. Thus, V =
H ⊕H⊥.
Notation. If W1 and W2 are R-submodule of an R-module V and β(⃗w1, ⃗w2) = 0 for all ⃗w1 ∈W1
and ⃗w2 ∈W2, we write W1⊥W2.
Moreover, any unimodular vector ⃗u may be complemented to a hyperbolic pair as follows.
First note that there is an f ∈HomR(V, R) such that f(⃗u) = 1. Since β is non-degenerate, there
is a ⃗v ∈V with 1 = f(⃗u) = β(⃗u,⃗v). Then {⃗u,⃗v} is a hyperbolic pair. Combining this with the
previous observation, we have the ﬁrst part of the following results.
Theorem 4.7.2. Let R be a local ring. Let (V, β) be a symplectic space over R of rank ≥2. Then
V splits as an orthogonal direct sum V = H⊥H⊥for some hyperbolic plane H. Moreover, H⊥is
a free R-module. Therefore, V is an orthogonal direct sum V = H1⊥H2⊥. . . ⊥Hm of hyperbolic
planes H1, H2, . . . , Hm. In particular, the rank of V is even.
Note that H⊥is a direct summand of the free module V . By Corollary 4.3.4, it is ﬁnitely
generated and projective. Then this theorem follows directly from the next lemma.
Lemma 4.7.3. A ﬁnitely generated projective module V over a local ring R is free.
Proof. Let M be the unique maximal ideal in R. Choose ⃗v1, . . . ,⃗vt ∈V so that the cosets {⃗v1 +
MV, . . . ,⃗vt+MV } is a basis for the vector space V/MV over the ﬁeld R/M. Here, the scalar action
is given by (c+M)(⃗x+MV ) = c⃗x+MV . Let ϕ : Rt →V be deﬁned by ϕ(r1, . . . , rt) = Pt
i=1 ri⃗vi.
By Remark after Theorem 4.6.1, ϕ is onto. Since V is projective, Rt = K ⊕L where K = ker ϕ
and L ∼= M. Then K is ﬁnitely generated. Since ϕ induces an isomorphism from Rt/MRt to
V/MV , it follows that K/MK ⊕L/ML ∼= V/MV . These are ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces
over the ﬁeld R/M. Comparing dimensions yields K/MK = 0. Thus, K = {⃗0} by Nakayama’s
lemma. Hence, ϕ is an isomorphism.

4.7.2
Symplectic Graphs
The general symplectic graph associated with nonsingular alternate matrices over a ﬁeld is studied
by Tang and Wan [42] as a new family of strongly regular graphs. Meemark and Prinyasart [32]
introduced the symplectic graph GSpR(V ) for a symplectic space V over a commutative ring R.
They showed that their symplectic graph is vertex transitive and arc transitive when R = Zpn,
p is an odd prime and n ≥1. There are many articles inﬂuenced by this deﬁnition such as
[30], [31], [24]. Mostly, the work was on strong regularity, automorphism groups, vertex and
arc transitivities, chromatic numbers and subconstituents of symplectic graphs over a ﬁnite ﬁeld,
modulo pn, and modulo pq, where p and q are primes and n ≥1. Recently, Meemark and Puirod
[33] studied those topics over ﬁnite local rings and obtained results parallel to [42], [32], [30],
[31] and [24]. Following [32], we recall the deﬁnition of the symplectic graph.
Let R be a commutative ring and (V, β) a symplectic space, where V is a free R-module of
rank 2ν, ν ≥1. Deﬁne the graph GSpR(V ) with vertex set is the set of lines {R⃗x : ⃗x is a unimodular
vector in V } and with adjacency given by
R⃗x is adjacent to R⃗y ⇔β(⃗x, ⃗y) ∈R×.
We call GSpR(V ), the symplectic graph of (V, β) over R.
A strongly regular graph with parameters (v, k, λ, µ) is a k-regular graph on v vertices such
that for every pair of adjacent vertices there are λ vertices adjacent to both, and for every pair of
non-adjacent vertices there are µ vertices adjacent to both.
Let k be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic and let (V ′, β) be a symplectic space of dimension
2ν where ν ≥1. Tang and Wan [42] showed that the symplectic graph GSpk(V ′) is a strongly
regular graph with parameters
|k|2ν −1
|k| −1 , |k|2ν−1, |k|2ν−2(|k| −1), |k|2ν−2(|k| −1)

.
Their proof used orthogonal complements and matrix theory over ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Let R be a ﬁnite local ring with unique maximal ideal M and residue k = R/M. Let V be a
free R-module of rank 2ν, ν ≥1, and let V ′ be the 2ν-dimensional vector space over k induced
from V via the canonical map π : R →k given by π : r 7→r+M. Moreover, if (V, β) is a symplectic
space, then (V ′, β′) is a symplectic space, where β′ is given by
β′(π(⃗a), π(⃗b)) = π(β(⃗a,⃗b))
for all ⃗a,⃗b ∈V . Here, we write π(⃗a) = (π(a1), π(a2), . . . , π(a2ν)) for all ⃗a = (a1, a2, . . . , a2ν) ∈V .
Note that the relation
R⃗x ∼R⃗y ⇔kπ(⃗x) = kπ(⃗y)
(4.7.1)
is an equivalence relation on the vertex set of the graph GSpR(V ). Since R is a local ring, it follows
that
β(⃗a,⃗b) ∈R× ⇔π(β(⃗a,⃗b)) ̸= M ⇔β′(π(⃗a), π(⃗b)) ∈k×.
This gives (3) of the next theorem.

4. Modules and Noetherian Rings
Theorem 4.7.4. [Lifting Theorem] Let R be a ﬁnite local ring with unique maximal ideal M and
residue k = R/M. Let κ = |k|2ν−1
|k|−1
and ⃗x1, ⃗x2, . . . , ⃗xκ be unimodular vectors in V such that the
vertex set
V(GSpk(V ′)) = {kπ(⃗xi) : i = 1, 2, . . . , κ}.
1. The set Π = {R(⃗x1 + M2ν), R(⃗x2 + M2ν), . . . , R(⃗xκ + M2ν)} is a partition of V(GSpR(V )),
where R(⃗xi + M2ν) = {R(⃗xi + ⃗m) : ⃗m ∈M2ν} for all ∈{1, 2, . . . , κ}. Moreover, for
each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , κ}, any two distinct vertices in R(⃗xi + M2ν) are non-adjacent vertices.
For each i, the lifting of the vertices corresponding with elements in kπ(⃗xi) to vertices in
R(⃗xi + M2ν) is demonstrated below.

2. |R(⃗xi + M2ν)| = |M|2ν−1 for all i ∈{1, . . . , κ}.
3. For unimodular vectors ⃗a,⃗b ∈V , we have R⃗a and R⃗b are adjacent vertices in V(GSpR(V )) if
and only if kπ(⃗a) and kπ(⃗b) are adjacent vertices in V(GSpk(V ′)).
4. For i, j ∈{1, 2, . . . , κ}, if kπ(⃗xi) and kπ(⃗xj) are adjacent vertices, then R(⃗xi + ⃗m1) and
R(⃗xj + ⃗m2) are adjacent vertices in V(GSpR(V )) for all ⃗m1, ⃗m2 ∈M2ν.
Proof. The ﬁrst part of (1) follows from the relation (4.7.1) and (4) is an immediate consequence
of (3). Note that
β(⃗xi + ⃗m1, ⃗xi + ⃗m2) = β(⃗xi, ⃗m1) + β(⃗m2, ⃗xi) + β(⃗m1, ⃗m2) ∈M
for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , κ} and ⃗m1, ⃗m2 ∈M2ν. This proves the second part of (1).
Next, let ⃗m1, ⃗m2 ∈M and assume that R(⃗xi + ⃗m1) = R(⃗xi + ⃗m2). Then ⃗xi + ⃗m1 = λ(⃗xi + ⃗m2)
for some λ ∈R×. Thus, (1 −λ)⃗xi = λ⃗m2 −⃗m1 ∈M2ν. Since ⃗xi is unimodular, 1 −λ ∈M,
so λ = 1 + µ for some µ ∈M. Hence, ⃗xi + ⃗m1 = (1 + µ)(⃗xi + ⃗m2). Finally, we show that
R(1 + µ)(⃗x + ⃗m) = R(⃗x + ⃗m) for all µ ∈M, ⃗x ∈V unimodular, and ⃗m ∈M2ν and we therefore
have (2). Clearly, R(1 + µ)(⃗x + ⃗m) ⊆R(⃗x + ⃗m). Since µ ∈M, 1 + µ ∈R×. Then r(⃗x + ⃗m) =
(r(1 + µ)−1)(1 + µ)(⃗x + ⃗m) for all r ∈R which gives another inclusion.
The results for a symplectic graph over a ﬁnite local ring are presented in the next theorem.
Our proof here is an application of the lifting theorem with some combinatorial arguments. This
approach is clean and much difference from the one given in [33]. It explains the reason why we
do not have strong regularity clearer and does not involve counting the number of solutions of
messy equations like in [32, 33].
Theorem 4.7.5. Let R be a ﬁnite local ring and let (V, β) be a symplectic space of dimension 2ν,
where ν ≥1.
1. The symplectic graph GSpR(V ) is |R|2ν−1-regular on |R|2ν −|M|2ν
|R×|
many vertices.
2. Every two adjacent vertices of GSpR(V ) has |R|2ν−2 R× common neighbors.
3. Every two non-adjacent vertices of GSpR(V ) has |R|2ν−2|R×| or |R|2ν−1 common neighbors.

4.7. Symplectic Geometry
141
Proof. By Theorem 4.7.4 (1) and (2), the number of vertices of GSpR(V ) is given by
κ|M|2ν−1 = |k|2ν −1
|k| −1 |M|2ν−1 = (|k|2ν −1)|M|2ν
(|k| −1)|M|
= |R|2ν −|M|2ν
|R×|
Since the graph GSpk(V ′) is |k|2ν−1-regular, Theorem 4.7.4 (3) implies that the graph GSpR(V ) is
also regular of degree
|k|2ν−1|M|2ν−1 = |R|2ν−1.
For each pair of adjacent vertices R(⃗xi + ⃗m1) and R(⃗xj + ⃗m2) in the graph GSpR(V ), the number
of common neighbors is given by the product of the common neighbors of vertices kπ(⃗xi) and
kπ(⃗xj) and |M|2ν−1 by Theorem 4.7.4 (4). Thus,
λ = |k|2ν−2(|k| −1)|M|2ν−1 = |R|2ν−2|R×|.
Assume that R(⃗xi + ⃗m1) and R(⃗xj + ⃗m1) are non-adjacent vertices in GSpR(V ). If i ̸= j, then
kπ(⃗xi) and kπ(⃗xj) are non-adjacent vertices in GSpk(V ′), so the number of common neighbors
of R(⃗xi + ⃗m1) and R(⃗xj + ⃗m2) is the product of common neighbors of kπ(⃗xi) and kπ(⃗xj) and
|M|2ν−1 which equals |R|2ν−2|R×| by Theorem 4.7.4 (3) and (4). For i = j, it is easy to see
that the number of common neighbors is the degree of regularity of GSpR(V ). This proves the
theorem.
Let R be a local ring with unique maximal ideal M and let (V, β) be a symplectic space of
rank 2ν, where ν ≥1.
By Theorem 4.7.2, V possesses a canonical basis {⃗e1, . . . ,⃗e2ν} such
that {⃗ej,⃗eν+j} is a hyperbolic pair for all 1 ≤j ≤ν and V is an orthogonal direct sum V =
H1⊥H2⊥. . . ⊥Hν, where Hj = R⃗ej ⊕R⃗eν+j is a hyperbolic plane for all 1 ≤j ≤ν.
Write unimodular vectors ⃗a = a1⃗e1+· · ·+a2ν⃗e2ν and⃗b = b1⃗e1+· · ·+b2ν⃗e2ν for some ai, bi ∈R.
Then
β(⃗a,⃗b) = β(a1⃗e1 + . . . + a2ν⃗e2ν, b1⃗e1 + . . . + b2ν⃗e2ν)

Next, let R be a ﬁnite commutative ring. By Corollary 4.6.7, R is a product of ﬁnite local rings
and we have completely studied our graphs over a ﬁnite local ring. Write
R = R1 × R2 × · · · × Rt
as a direct product of ﬁnite local rings Ri, i = 1, 2, . . . , t. Consider V = R2ν, a free R-module of

(4.7.4)
as a graph isomorphism. Here, for two graphs G and H, we deﬁne their tensor product G ⊗H to
be the graph with vertex set V(G) × V(H), where (u, v) is adjacent to (u′, v′) if and only if u is
adjacent to u′ and v is adjacent to v′.
From Theorem 4.7.5 (1) and the above discussion, we have the number of vertices of GSpR(V )
is equal to
|V(GSpR(V ))| =
tY
j=1
|V(GSpRj (V (j)))| =

adjacent vertices of GSpR(V ) has |R|2ν−2|R×| common neighbors by Theorem 4.7.5 (2). We record
these results in the next theorem.
Theorem 4.7.6. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative ring and (V, β) be the induced symplectic space of
rank 2ν, ν ≥1, discussed above.
1. The symplectic graph GSpR(V ) is a |R|2ν−1-regular and isomorphic to the graph
GSpR1(V (1)) ⊗GSpR2(V (2)) ⊗· · · ⊗GSpRt(V (t)).
2. Every two adjacent vertices of GSpR(V ) has |R|2ν−2|R×| common neighbors.

Exercises 4.7.
1. Let R be a local ring with unique maximal ideal M and let (V, β) be a symplectic
space of R-dimension 2ν, where ν ≥1. Let ⃗a = a1⃗e1 + · · · + a2ν⃗e2ν and ⃗b = b1⃗e1 + · · · + b2ν⃗e2ν be
unimodular vectors in V and assume that ai ∈R× for some i ∈{1, . . . , 2ν}. If R⃗a is adjacent to R⃗b,
prove that aibl −albi is a unit for some l ∈{1, . . . , 2ν} and l ̸= i.

2. The chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices
of G so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Tang and Wan [42] showed that if k is the
ﬁeld of q elements and V ′ is the symplectic space of dimension 2ν, ν ≥1, then the chromatic number
of the symplectic graph GSpk(V ′)) is qν + 1. Let R be a local ring with unique maximal ideal M and
residue ﬁeld k and let (V, β) be a symplectic space of R-dimension 2ν, where ν ≥1. Determine the
chromatic number of the symplectic graph GSpR(V ). (Hint. Use the lifting theorem.)
3. Let G and H be graphs. A function σ from V(G) to V(H) is a homomorphism from G to H if σ(g1)
and σ(g2) are adjacent in H whenever g1 and g2 are adjacent in G. It is called an isomorphism if
it is a bijection and σ−1 is a homomorphism from H onto G. Moreover, an isomorphism on G is
called an automorphism. The set of all automorphisms of a graph G is denoted by Aut (G). It is a
group under composition, called the automorphism group of G. Prove that for graphs G and H,
Aut (G) × Aut (H) ⊆Aut (G ⊗H).
4. A graph G is vertex transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on the vertex set. That
is, for any two vertices of G, there is an automorphism carrying one to the other. An arc in G is an
ordered pair of adjacent vertices, and G is arc transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively
on its arcs. Klingenberg [28] showed that for a local ring R, if {⃗x,⃗a} and {⃗x,⃗b} are hyperbolic pairs
of unimodular vectors in V , then there exists an isometry σ in SpR(V ) which leaves ⃗x invariant and
carries ⃗a to ⃗b. Let R be a ﬁnite local ring and let (V, β) be a symplectic space of dimension 2ν. Show
that
(a) SpR(V ) acts transitively on unimodular vectors and on hyperbolic planes.
(b) The symplectic graph GSpR(V ) is vertex transitive and arc transitive.
Show further that (b) holds for any ﬁnite commutative ring R. (Hint. Use 3.)
Project 23 (Orthogonal graphs). Similar to symplectic graphs, we may study orthogonal graphs over a
ﬁnite commutative ring deﬁned as follows.
Let R be a commutative ring and let V be a free R-module of rank n, where n ≥2. Assume that we
have a function β : V × V →R which is R-bilinear, symmetric and the R−module morphism from V to
V ∗= homR(V, R) given by ⃗x 7→β(·, ⃗x) is an isomorphism. For ⃗x ∈V , we call β(⃗x, ⃗x) the norm of ⃗x. The
pair (V, β) is called an orthogonal space.
Let R be a commutative ring and let (V, β) be an orthogonal space, where V is a free R-module of rank
n ≥2. A vector ⃗x in V is said to be unimodular if there is an f in homR(V, R) with f(⃗x) = 1; equivalently,
if ⃗x = α1⃗b1 + . . . + αn⃗bn, where {⃗b1, . . . ,⃗bn} is a basis for V , then the ideal (α1, . . . , αn) = R. If ⃗x is
unimodular, then the line R⃗x is free R-direct summand of rank one. Moreover, it is easy to see that if ⃗x
and ⃗y are unimodular vectors in V , then R⃗x = R⃗y if and only if ⃗x = λ⃗y for some λ ∈R×.
Deﬁne the graph GOR(V ) whose vertex set V(GOR(V )) is the set of lines
{R⃗x : ⃗x is a unimodular vector in V and β(⃗x, ⃗x) = 0}
and its adjacency condition is given by
R⃗x is adjacent to R⃗y ⇐⇒β(⃗x, ⃗y) ∈R×(or equivalently, β(⃗x, ⃗y) = 1).
We call GOR(V ) the orthogonal graph of (V, β) over R.
(a) Show that the above adjacency condition is well deﬁned.
(b) If k is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic and V ′
δ is an orthogonal space over k of dimension 2ν + δ,
where ν ≥1 and δ ∈{0, 1, 2}, then Gu and Wan [23] showed that GOk(V ′
δ ) is a |k|ν+δ−1 + 1-partite
graph with partite sets X1, X2, . . . , X|k|ν+δ−1+1 such that |Xi| = |k|ν−1
|k|−1 for all i ∈{1, 2, . . . , |k|ν+δ−1+
1}. They also had that (Theorem 2.1 of [23]) the orthogonal graph GOk(V ′
δ ) is |k|2ν+δ−2-regular on
(|k|ν −1)(|k|ν+δ−1 + 1)
|k| −1
many vertices. Moreover, if ν = 1, then it is a complete graph, and if ν ≥2,
then the graph is a strongly regular graph with parameters
λ = |k|2ν+δ−2 −|k|2ν+δ−3 −|k|ν−1 + |k|ν+δ−2 and µ = |k|2ν+δ−2 −|k|2ν+δ−3,
respectively. Construct the lifting theorem for orthogonal graphs and determine the results similar
to Theorem 4.7.5 for orthogonal graphs over a ﬁnite local ring.

Field Theory
In Section 2.6, we learn about extensions of a ﬁeld. Here, we give more details on a construction
of extension ﬁelds. We prepare the readers to Galois theory which yields a connection between
ﬁeld theory and group theory. Applications of Galois theory are provided in proving fundamental
theorem of algebra, ﬁnite ﬁelds, and cyclotomic ﬁelds. We discuss some results on a transcenden-
tal extension in the ﬁnal section.
5.1
Splitting Fields
Let F be a ﬁeld. Given a polynomial f(x) ∈F[x] we would like to have at hand an extension
ﬁeld E of F which in some sense contains all the roots of the equation f(x) = 0. We recall that
f(r) = 0 if and only if f(x) is divisible by x −r.
We say that f(x) splits in an extension ﬁeld E if f(x) =
n
Y
i=1
c(x −ri), that is, it is a product of
linear factors in E[x] and c ∈F. We shall ﬁrst study some facts about the roots of f(x) ∈F[x] as
follows.
Theorem 5.1.1. If f(x) ∈F[x] and deg f(x) = n ≥1, then f(x) can have at most n roots
counting multiplicities in any extension ﬁeld of F.
Proof. We shall prove the theorem by induction on the degree of f(x). If deg f(x) = 1, then
f(x) = ax + b for some a, b ∈F and a ̸= 0. Then −b/a is the unique root of f(x) and −b/a ∈F,
so we are done.
Let deg f(x) = n > 1 and assume that the result is true for all polynomials of degree < n. Let
E be any extension ﬁeld of F. If f(x) has no roots in E, then we are done. Let r ∈E be a root
of f(x) of multiplicity m ≥1. Then there exists q(x) ∈E[x] such that f(x) = (x −r)mq(x) and
q(r) ̸= 0. Thus, deg q(x) = n −m. By the inductive hypothesis q(x) has at most n −m roots in E
counting multiplicities. Hence, f(x) has at most m+(n−m) roots in E counting multiplicities.
Theorem 5.1.2. [Kronocker] If p(t) ∈F[t] is irreducible over F, then there exists an extension
ﬁeld E of F such that [E : F] = deg p(t) and p(t) has a root in E.
Proof. Let E = F[x]/(p(x)) where x is an indeterminate. Then E is a ﬁeld containing {a +
(p(x)) : a ∈F} as a subﬁeld. But F ∼= {a + (p(x)) : a ∈F} by ϕ : a 7→a + (p(x)), so E
can be considered as an extension ﬁeld of F by considering a as a + (p(x)) for all a ∈F. Then
E = F[x]/(p(x)) = F(¯t) where ¯t = x + (p(x)) is a root of p(t). Since E = F(¯t) and p(t) is
irreducible over F, [E : F] = [F(¯t) : F] = deg p(t) by Corollary 2.6.5.
Corollary 5.1.3. If p(t) ∈F[t] is a nonconstant polynomial, then there exists a ﬁnite extension
ﬁeld E of F containing a root of p(t) and [E : F] ≤deg p(t).
145

146
5. Field Theory
Proof. Since F[t] is a UFD, p(t) has an irreducible factor in F[t] say p1(t). By Theorem 5.1.2, there
exists an extension ﬁeld E of F such that E contains a root of p1(t) and [E : F] = deg p1(t).
Hence, [E : F] ≤deg p(t) and E contains a root of p(t).
Let F be a ﬁeld and f(x) a monic polynomial in F[x]. An extension ﬁeld E of F is a splitting
ﬁeld of f(x) over F if
f(x) = (x −r1) . . . (x −rn)
in E[x] and
E = F(r1, . . . , rn),
that is, E is generated by the roots of f(x). The next results demonstrate the existence of a
splitting ﬁeld for a monic polynomial.
Theorem 5.1.4. [Existence of Splitting Fields] Let f(x) be a monic polynomial of degree n ≥1.
Then there exists an extension ﬁeld E of F such that [E : F] ≤n! and E contains n roots of
f(x) counting multiplicities. Hence, in E[t], f(x) = c(x −r1) . . . (x −rn) for some c ∈F and
r1, . . . , rn ∈E, so that r1, . . . , rn are n roots of f(x) in E.
Proof. We shall prove the theorem by induction on the degree of f(x). If deg f(x) = 1, then f(x)
has exactly one root in F and [F : F] = 1 = 1!.
Let deg f(x) = n > 1 and assume that the theorem is true for the case of polynomials of
degree < n. By Corollary 5.1.3, there exists an extension ﬁeld E0 of F such that f(x) has a root,
say r ∈E0 and [E0 : F] ≤n. Since r is a root of f(x), f(x) = (x −r)q(x) for some q(x) ∈E0[x],
so deg q(x) = n −1. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists an extension ﬁeld E of E0 such
that [E : E0] ≤(n −1)! and E contains n −1 roots of q(x). Then E is an extension ﬁeld of F,
[E : F] = [E : E0][E0 : F] ≤n! and E contains n roots of f(x) counting multiplicities.
Corollary 5.1.5. Let F be a ﬁeld and f(x) a nonconstant polynomial over F of degree n. Then
there exists a splitting ﬁeld E of f(x) over F. Moreover, [E : F] ≤n!.
Proof. We have seen from Theorem 5.1.4 that there exists an extension ﬁeld E of F such that
f(x) = c(x −r1) . . . (x −rn), for some c ∈F and r1, . . . , rn ∈E, is a product of linear factors in
E[x] and [E : F] ≤n!. Hence, E = F(r1, . . . , rn) is a desired ﬁeld.
Examples 5.1.1 (Examples of splitting ﬁelds).
1. Let f(x) = x2 + ax + b. If f(x) is reducible
in F[x] (F arbitrary) then F is a splitting ﬁeld. Otherwise, put E = F[x]/(f(x)) = F(r1)
where r1 = x + (f(x)). Then E is a splitting ﬁeld since f(r1) = 0, so f(x) = (x −r1)(x −r2)
in E[x]. Thus, E = F(r1) = F(r1, r2). Since f(x) is the minimal polynomial of r1 over F,
[E : F] = 2.
2. Let the base ﬁeld F be Z/(2), the ﬁeld of two elements, and let f(x) = x3 + x + 1. Since
1+1+1 ̸= 0 and 0+0+1 ̸= 0, f(x) has no roots in F; hence f(x) is irreducible in F[x]. Put
r1 = x + (f(x)) in F[x]/(f(x)) so F(r1) is a ﬁeld and x3 + x + 1 = (x + r1)(x2 + ax + b)
in F(r1)[x]. (Note that we can write + for −since characteristic is two.) Comparison
of coefﬁcients shows that a = r1, b = 1 + r2
1.
The elements of F(r1) can be listed as
c+dr1+er2
1, c, d, e ∈F. There are eight of these: 0, 1, r1, 1+r1, r2
1, 1+r2
1, r1+r2
1 and 1+r1+r2
1.
Substituting these in x2 +r1x+1+r2
1, we reach (r2
1)2 +r1(r2
1)+1+r2
1 = r4
1 +r3
1 +1+r2
1 = 0
since r3
1 = r1 + 1 and r4
1 = r2
1 + r1. Hence, x2 + ax + b factors into linear factors in F(r1)[x]
and E = F(r1) is a splitting ﬁeld of x3 + x + 1 over F.
3. Let F = Q, f(x) = (x2 −2)(x2 −3). Since the rational roots of x2 −2 and x2 −3 must be
integral, it follows that x2 −2 and x2 −3 are irreducible in Q[x]. Form K = Q(r1), r1 =
x + (x2 −2) in Q[x]/(x2 −2). The elements of K have the form a + br1, a, b ∈Q. We
claim that x2 −3 is irreducible in K[x]. Otherwise, we have rational numbers a, b such that

5.1. Splitting Fields
147
(a + br1)2 = 3. Then (a2 + 2b2) + 2abr1 = 3 so that ab = 0 and a2 + 2b2 = 3. If b = 0 we
obtain a2 = 3 which is impossible since
√
3 is not rational, and if a = 0, b2 = 3/2. Then
(2b2) = 6 and since
√
6 is not rational, we again obtain an impossibility. Thus, x2 −3 is
irreducible in K[x]. Now form E = K[x]/(x2 −3). Then this is a splitting ﬁeld over Q of
(x2 −2)(x2 −3) and [E : Q] = [E : K][K : Q] = 2 · 2 = 4.
4. Let F = Q, f(x) = xp −1, p a prime. We have xp −1 = (x −1)(xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1)
and we know that xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1 is irreducible in Q[x]. Let E = Q(z) where
z = x+(xp−1 +xp−2 +· · ·+x+1) in Q[x]/(xp−1 +xp−2 +· · ·+x+1). We have 1, z, . . . , zp−1
are distinct. Also (zk)p = (zp)k = 1 so every zk is a root of xp −1. It follows that xp −1 =
Qp
k=1(x −zk) in E[x]. Thus, E is a splitting ﬁeld over Q of xp −1 and [E : Q] = p −1.
5. Since x3 −2 = (x −
3√
2)(x −
3√
2ω)(x −
3√
2ω2) where ω ̸= 1 and ω3 = 1, Q(
3√
2) is not a
splitting ﬁeld of f(x) = x3 −2 over Q. A splitting ﬁeld of f(x) is E = Q(
3√
2, ω). Since
g(x) = x2 + x + 1 is irreducible over Q(
3√
2) and g(ω) = 0, [E : Q(
3√
2)] = 2, so [E : F] =
[E : Q(
3√
2)][Q(
3√
2) : Q] = 2 · 3 = 6.
6. A splitting ﬁeld over Z/(p) of xpe −1, e ∈N, is Z/(p).
Theorem 5.1.6. [Uniqueness of Splitting Fields] Let η : F →F1 be an isomorphism of ﬁelds
and let η : F[x] →F1[x] be the isomorphism which extends η and satisﬁes η(x) = x. Suppose
f(x) is a monic polynomial in F[x], let f1(x) = η(f(x)) and suppose that E/F and E1/F1 are
splitting ﬁelds of f(x) and f1(x), respectively. Then there exists an isomorphism η∗: E →E1
which extends η.
Proof. Let ˆf(x) be an irreducible factor of f(x) and let ˆf1(x) = η( ˆf(x)). Let r ∈E be a root
of ˆf(x) and let r1 ∈E1 be a root of ˆf1(x). Then we have a commutative diagram in which the
vertical arrows are isomorphisms and the horizontal arrows are inclusion maps

The map jˆηi−1 = ¯η is an isomorphism of ﬁelds extending η. Also, ¯η(f(x)/(x −r)) = f1(x)/(x −r)
and E/F[r], E1/F1[r1] are splitting ﬁelds of f(x)/(x −r) and f1(x)/(x −r1), respectively.
Now, by induction on deg f(x), ¯η : F[r] →F1[r1] has an extension to η∗: E →E1 and this is
the required extension of η.
Theorem 5.1.7. Assume f(x) has no multiple factors as an element of F[x]. Under the hypothesis
of Theorem 5.1.6, the number of distinct extensions of η : F →F1 to η : E →E1 is at most [E : F].
Moreover, the number of distinct extensions is equal to [E : F] if and only if f(x) has distinct roots
in E.
Proof. Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 5.1.6, let ˆf(x) be an irreducible factor of f(x), let d
be the degree of ˆf(x), let ˆf1(x) = η( ˆf(x)), let r1, . . . , re be the distinct roots of ˆf(x) in E and let
r′
1, . . . , r′
e be the roots of ˆf1(x) in E1. (Note that e ≤d and e = d if ˆf1(x) has no multiple roots,
but this is not always the case.)

5. Field Theory
Next ﬁx a root r = r1 of ˆf(x). The argument of Theorem 5.1.6 shows that for each root
r′
1, . . . , r′
e of ˆf1(x) there is an isomorphism ¯ηj : F[r] →F1[r′

On the other hand, any isomorphism of F[r] into E1 must carry r into a root of ˆf1(x), and so must
one of the ¯ηj. Furthermore, as noted above
the number of roots of ˆf(x) = e ≤d = [F[r] : F].
By induction, the number of ways each ˆηj can be extended to an isomorphism E →E1 is at most
[E : F[r]]. Thus,
the number of extensions of η : F →F1 to η∗: E →E1
≤e[E : F[r]] ≤[F[r] : F][E : F[r]] = [E : F].
Now we want to answer the question: When is there equality – that is, the number of exten-
sions = [E : F]?
Looking at the ﬁrst step above we see that the number of roots of ˆf(x) = e = d = [F[r] : F] if
and only if ˆf(x) has d = deg ˆf(x) roots – that is if and only if ˆf(x) has distinct roots.
To continue inductively, we now have the set up

The key point is that E is the splitting ﬁeld over F[r] of the polynomial f(x)/(x −r).
This
polynomial has no multiple factor so inductively the number of extensions of ˆηj to an isomorphism
η∗: E →E1 is equal to [E : F[r]] if and only if f(x)/(x−r) has distinct roots. Combining this with
the result for ˆf(x) we get the number of extensions of η : F →F1 to an isomorphism η : E →E1
is equal to [E : F] if and only if f(x) has distinct roots in E.
Remarks. (1) If f(x) is an irreducible polynomial over a ﬁeld F and r is a root of f(x) in some
extension ﬁeld of F, then
F[x]/f(x)F[x] ∼= F[r].
However, if f(x) = g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are irreducible polynomials, then by Chinese
remainder theorem
F[x]/f(x)F[x] ∼= F[x]/g(x)F[x] × F[x]/h(x)F[x]
a direct product of ﬁelds. If f(x) = g(x)2, then F[x]/f(x)F[x] even has nilpotent elements.
In general, E/F arises from a succession of simple extensions
F ⊆F1 ∼= F[x]/f1(x)F[x],
F1 ⊆F2 ∼= F1[x]/f2(x)F1[x],
...
Fr−1 ⊆Fr ∼= Fr−1[x]/fr(x)Fr−1[x] = E.

5.2. Algebraic Closure of a Field
149
We shall see that in some important cases (but not all), the splitting ﬁeld E/F of the polynomial
f(x) can be achieved as a simple extension F ⊆F[x]/g(x)F[x] = E, but usually g(x) ̸= f(x).
(2) If f(x) and g(x) have the same roots in some extension ﬁeld E of F (f(x), g(x) ∈F[x]),
then they have the same splitting ﬁeld. However, one cannot guarantee that the roots of f(x) are
distinct (or simple, or one fold). The basic example is the polynomial
f(x) = xp −a ∈F[a]
where F is a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0. If r is a root of f(x) in some extension ﬁeld E of F[a],
then rp = a and the factorization of f(x) in E[x] is
f(x) = xp −a = xp −rp = (x −r)p.

5.2
Algebraic Closure of a Field
We know about the prime ﬁeld which is the smallest ﬁeld such that every other ﬁeld is an extension
of it. However, we does not know if we can algebraically extend our ﬁeld F forever to obtain a
ﬁeld that every polynomial in F[x] has a root in it. We shall assure it in this section.
A ﬁeld F is called algebraically closed if every monic polynomial f(x) of positive degree with
coefﬁcients in F has a root in F.
Theorem 5.2.1. Let F be a ﬁeld. The following statements are equivalent.
(i) F is algebraically closed.
(ii) An irreducible polynomial in F[x] is linear, and hence every polynomial of F[x] of positive
degree is a product of linear factors.
(iii) F has no proper algebraic extension ﬁeld.
Proof. Since r is a root, that is f(r) = 0, if and only if x −r is a factor of f(x) in F[x], we have
(i) ⇔(ii). Next, we show (i) ⇔(iii). If E is an extension ﬁeld of F and a ∈E is algebraic
over F, then [F(a) : F] is the degree of the minimal polynomial f(x) of a over F, and f(x)
is monic and irreducible. Then a ∈F if and only if deg f(x) = 1. Hence, E is algebraic over
F and E ⊃F implies there exist irreducible monic polynomials in F[x] of degree ≥2; hence
F is not algebraically closed. Conversely, if F is not algebraically closed, then there exists a
monic irreducible f(x) ∈F[x] with deg f(x) ≥2, Thus, the ﬁeld F[x]/(f(x)) is a proper algebraic
extension of F.
We recall that (Corollary 2.6.7) if E is an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld F, then the set of elements
of E that are algebraic over F constitutes a subﬁeld A of E/F (that is, a subﬁeld of E containing
F). Evidently E = A if and only if E is algebraic over F. At the other extreme, if A = F, then
F is said to be algebraically closed in E. In any case A is algebraically closed in E, since any
element of E that is algebraic over A is algebraic over F and so is contained in A. This result
shows that if a ﬁeld F has an algebraically closed extension ﬁeld, then it has one that is algebraic

over F. We call an extension ﬁeld E/F an algebraic closure of F if E is algebraic over F and E
is algebraically closed.
For example, assuming the truth of the fundamental theorem of algebra (Theorem 5.5.6), that
C is algebraically closed, it follows that the ﬁeld of A of algebraic numbers is an algebraic closure
of Q, and thus A is algebraically closed.
We proceed to prove the existence and uniqueness up to isomorphism of an algebraic closure
of any ﬁeld F. For a countable F a straightforward argument is available to establish these results.
We begin by enumerating the monic polynomials of positive degree as f1(x), f2(x), . . . . Evidently
this can be done. We now deﬁne inductively a sequence of extension ﬁelds beginning with F0 = F
and letting Fi be a splitting ﬁeld over Fi−1 of fi(x). The construction of such splitting ﬁelds was
given at the end of the previous section. It is clear that every Fi is countable, so we can realize all
of these constructions in some large set S. Then we can take E = S Fi in the set. Alternatively
we can deﬁne E to be a direct limit of the ﬁelds Fi. It is easily seen that E is an algebraic closure
of F. We showed that (Theorem 5.1.6) there exists an isomorphism of K1/F onto K2/F. This
can be used to prove the isomorphism theorem for algebraic closures of a countable ﬁeld by a
simple inductive argument.
The pattern of the proof sketched above can be carried over to the general case by using
“transﬁnite induction”. This is what was done by E. Steinitz, who ﬁrst proved these results. There
are several alternative proofs available that are based on Zorn’s lemma. We shall give one that
makes use of the following lemma.
Lemma 5.2.2. If E is an algebraic extension of a ﬁeld F, then the cardinality of E cannot exceed
the cardinality of F[x].
Proof. Let S be the set of all ordered pairs (f, α) where f(x) ∈F[x] is nonzero and α ∈E with
f(α) = 0. Since for each polynomial f(x), the number of α such that (f, α) lies in S is ﬁnite, we
have |S| ≤|F[x]|ℵ0 = |F[x]|. On the other hand, E maps injectively into S via α 7→(fα, α) where
fα is the minimal polynomial of α, and thus |E| ≤|S|.
Recall that |F[x]| = |F|ℵ0. If F is inﬁnite, then |F[x]| = |F| and it follows that |E| = |F|.
When F is ﬁnite, F[x] is countable, and hence E is either ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite.
Corollary 5.2.3. There exist real numbers transcendental over Q.
Proof. There are only countably many polynomials in Q[x]. Since R is uncountable, the above
lemma guarantees that R is not algebraic over Q.
We can now prove the existence of algebraic closures.
Theorem 5.2.4. Any ﬁeld F has an algebraic closure.
Proof. We ﬁrst embed F in a set S in which we have a lot of elbow room. Precisely, we assume
that |S| > |F| if F is inﬁnite and that S is uncountable if F is ﬁnite. We now deﬁne a set Λ whose
elements are (E, +, ·) where E is a subset of S containing F and +, · are binary compositions in
E such that (E, +, ·) is an algebraic extension ﬁeld of F. We partially order Λ by declaring that
(E, +, ·) > (E′, +′, ·′) if E is an extension ﬁeld of E′. By Zorn’s lemma there exists a maximal
element (E, +, ·). Then E is an algebraic extension of F. We claim that E is algebraically closed.
Otherwise we have a proper algebraic extension E′ = E(a) of E. Then |E′| < |S|, so we can
deﬁne an injective map of E′ into S that is the identity on E and then we can transfer the
addition and multiplication on E′ to its image. This gives an element of Λ bigger than (E, +, ·).
This contradiction shows that E is an algebraic closure of F.

5.2. Algebraic Closure of a Field
151
Next we take up the question of uniqueness of algebraic closures. It is useful to generalize the
concept of a splitting ﬁeld of a polynomial to apply to sets of polynomials.
If Γ = {fα(x)} is a set of monic polynomials with coefﬁcients in F, then an extension ﬁeld
E/F is called a splitting ﬁeld over F of the set Γ if
1. every fα(x) ∈Γ is a product of linear factors in E[x] and
2. E is generated over F by the roots of the fα(x) ∈Γ.
It is clear that if E is a splitting ﬁeld over F of Γ, then no proper subﬁeld of E/F is a splitting
ﬁeld of Γ and if K is any intermediate ﬁeld, then E is a splitting ﬁeld of Γ. Since an algebraic
closure E of F is algebraic, it is clear that E is a splitting ﬁeld over F of the complete set of
monic polynomials of positive degree in F[x]. The isomorphism theorem for algebraic closures
will therefore be a consequence of a general result on isomorphisms of splitting ﬁelds that we
shall now prove. Our starting point is the following result, which is Theorem 5.1.6.
Let η : a 7→˜a be an isomorphism of a ﬁeld F onto a ﬁeld ˜F, f(x) ∈F[x] be monic of positive
degree, ˜f(x) the corresponding polynomial in ˜F[x] (under the isomorphism, which is η on F and
sends x 7→x), and let E and ˜E be splitting ﬁelds over F and ˜F of f(x) and ˜f(x), respectively.
Then η can be extended to an isomorphism of E onto ˜E.
We shall now extend this to a set of polynomials.
Theorem 5.2.5. Let η : a 7→˜a be an isomorphism of a ﬁeld F onto a ﬁeld ˜F, Γ a set of monic
polynomials fα(x) ∈F[x], ˜Γ the corresponding set of polynomials ˜f(x) ∈˜F[x], E and ˜E splitting
ﬁelds over F and ˜F of Γ and ˜Γ, respectively. Then η can be extended to an isomorphism of E
onto ˜E.
Proof. The proof is a straightforward application of Zorn’s lemma. We consider the set of exten-
sions of η to monomorphisms of subﬁelds of E/F into ˜E/ ˜F and use Zorn’s lemma to obtain a
maximal one. This must be deﬁned on the whole E, since otherwise we could get a larger one
by applying the result quoted to one of the polynomials fα(x) ∈Γ. Now if ζ is a monomorphism
of E into ˜E such that ζ|F = η, then it is clear that ζ(E) is a splitting ﬁeld over ˜F of ˜Γ. Hence,
ζ(E) = ˜E and ζ is an isomorphism of E onto ˜E.
As we have observed, this result applies in particular to algebraic closures. If we take ˜F = F
and η = id , we obtain
Theorem 5.2.6. Any two algebraic closures of a ﬁeld F are isomorphic over F.
From now on we shall appropriate the notation ¯F for any determination of an algebraic closure
of F. If A is any algebraic extension of F, its algebraic closure ¯A is an algebraic extension of A,
hence of F, and so ¯A is an algebraic closure of F. Consequently, we have an isomorphism of ¯A/F
into ¯F/F. This maps A/F into a subﬁeld of ¯F/F. Thus, we see that every algebraic extension
A/F can be realized as a subﬁeld of the algebraic closure ¯F/F.
Exercises 5.2.
1. No ﬁnite ﬁeld F is algebraically closed. [Hint. If F = {0, 1, a2, . . . , an}, consider the
polynomial 1 + x(x −1)(x −a2) . . . (x −an) ∈F[x].]
2. Let E be an algebraic extension of a ﬁeld F and A an algebraic closure of F. Show that E/F is
isomorphic to a subﬁeld of A/F. [Hint. Consider the algebraic closure ¯A of A and note that this is
an algebraic closure of F.]

Multiple Roots and Separability
Recall the following facts from Subsection 2.6.2 about the multiple roots.
Let R be an integral domain and f(x) ∈R[x]. If α is a root of f(x), then there exist m ∈N
and g(x) ∈R[x] such that f(x) = (x −α)mg(x) and g(α) ̸= 0. m is called the multiplicity of the
root α of f(x) and if m > 1, α is called a multiple root of f(x).
If f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈R[x], we deﬁne f′(x) ∈R[x], the derivative of f(x), to be
f′(x) = a1 + a2x + · · · + nanxn−1.
We record the straightforward properties of the derivative of polynomials in the next lemma.
Lemma 5.3.1. If f(x) and g(x) are polynomials over an integral domain R and c ∈R, then
1. (cf(x))′ = cf′(x),
2. (f(x) + g(x))′ = f′(x) + g′(x),
3. (f(x)g(x))′ = f(x)g′(x) + f′(x)g(x),
4. ((f(x))n)′ = n(f(x))n−1f′(x) where n ∈N.
Theorem 5.3.2. Let E be an extension of a ﬁeld F and f(x) ∈F[x].
1. For α ∈E, α is a multiple root of f(x) if and only if α is a root of both f(x) and f′(x).
2. If f(x) and f′(x) are relatively prime, then f(x) has no multiple root.
3. If f(x) is irreducible over F having a root in E, then
f(x) has no multiple root in E if and only if f′(x) ̸= 0.
Proof. (1) is clear.
(2) Since f(x) and f′(x) are relatively prime, there exist h(x) and k(x) in F[x] such that 1 =
f(x)h(x) + f′(x)k(x). If α ∈E is a multiple root of f(x), by (1), f(α) = 0 = f′(α), so 1 = 0, a
contradiction.
(3) Since f(x) is irreducible, f′(x) ̸= 0 and deg f′(x) < deg f(x), we have f(x) and f′(x) are
relatively prime, so f(x) has no multiple roots. Conversely, if f′(x) = 0, then f(α) = 0 = f′(α)
for some α ∈E since f(x) has a root in E. Hence, by (1), α is a multiple root of f(x).
Let F be a ﬁeld. A polynomial f(x) ∈F[x] is separable if every root (in some splitting ﬁeld
over F) of its irreducible factor is not a multiple root. If E is an extension of F and α ∈E is
algebraic over F, then α is separable over F if its minimal polynomial over F is separable.
Let F ⊂K ⊂E be ﬁeld extensions. Note that if α is separable over F, then α is separable
over K since mα,K(x) | mα,F (x). Here mα,−(x) stands for the minimal polynomial of α over the
indicated ﬁeld.
Examples 5.3.1.
1. Consider f(x) = x2+1. Over Q, we have f(x) is irreducible and separable
but over Z/(2), we have f(x) = x2 + 1 = (x + 1)2 is not irreducible but is separable since
the only irreducible factor is x + 1 which is separable over Z/(2).
2. Let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic p and F = K(y) be the ﬁeld of rational functions over K
with indeterminate y. Since K[y] is UFD, y is irreducible element in K[y], so the polynomial
f(x) = xp −y in F[x] is irreducible over F by Eisenstien criterion. Since f′(x) = 0 and f(x)
has a root, say α in some splitting ﬁeld E of F, α is a multiple root of f(x), so f(x) is not
separable over F. However, if we consider f(x) = xp −y ∈E[x], we have f(x) = (x −α)p
and its irreducible factor in E[x] is only x−α which is separable over E, so f(x) is separable
over E.
Suppose that F is a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and f(x) is a monic irreducible polynomial
over F, say f(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + an−1xn−1 + xn. Then f′(x) = a1 + 2a2x + · · · + nxn−1. The
key point is that n ̸= 0, so f′(x) ̸= 0. Since deg f′(x) < deg f(x) and f(x) is irreducible, f(x) and
f′(x) are relatively prime, so all roots of f(x) are simple. Thus, we have shown:

5.3. Multiple Roots and Separability
153
Theorem 5.3.3. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Then every polynomial f(x) ∈F[x] is
separable.
We call an algebraic extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F a separable extension if the minimal
polynomial of every element of E is separable. Hence, if F is of characteristic zero, then every
algebraic extension is a separable extension. A ﬁeld F is perfect if every polynomial f(x) over F
is separable. Thus, all ﬁelds of characteristic zero are perfect.
Remark. Suppose F is a ﬁeld (or even a commutative ring) of characteristic p > 0. Then the
identities
(ab)p = apbp
and
(a + b)p = ap + bp
show that the map ϕ : F →F deﬁned by ϕ(a) = ap is a ring homomorphism. Since F is a ﬁeld,
ϕ has to be one-to-one. But ϕ does not have to be onto - for example
ϕ : (Z/pZ)(x) →(Z/pZ)(x)
is not onto; the image is (Z/pZ)(xp). However, if F is ﬁnite of order pn, then apn = a for all a ∈F,
so ϕ is onto and ϕn is the identity map, called the Frobenius’ automorphism.
Theorem 5.3.4. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0, and let a ∈F.
(1) If a ∈F p and a = rp, then xp −a = (x −r)p.
(2) If a /∈F p, then xp −a is irreducible.
Proof. (1) is trivial.
(2) In a splitting ﬁeld for F, xp −a = (x −r)p (r may not be in F). Any proper factor of xp −a
(after being made monic) has the form (x −r)i where 1 ≤i ≤p −1. Thus, if xp −a has a proper
factor over F, then ri ∈F for some 1 ≤i ≤p −1. But then ri and rp = a ∈F, so r ∈F since
(i, p) = 1. Hence, a = rp ∈F p.
Theorem 5.3.5. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0. Then F is perfect if and only if F = F p.
Proof. Suppose F ̸= F p and choose a ∈F ∖F p. By Theorem 5.3.4, xp −a is irreducible. But
xp −a does not have distinct roots in a splitting ﬁeld of F. Hence, F is not perfect.
Conversely, assume that F is not perfect. Then there is an irreducible polynomial f(x) over
F which does not have simple roots. By Theorem 5.3.2, this means that f(x) and f′(x) are not
relatively prime. Since f(x) is irreducible and deg f′(x) < deg f(x), f′(x) = 0. Thus, f(x) is a
polynomial in xp, i.e.,
f(x) = a0 + apxp + a2px2p + · · · + a(m−1)px(m−1)p + xmp.
We shall claim that some ajp /∈F p. For if each ajp ∈F p, say ajp = (bj)p, then f(x) = g(x)p where
g(x) = b0 + b1x + · · · + bm−1xm−1 + xm
which contradicts the irreducibility of f(x) over F. This establishes the claim. Hence, ajp /∈F p
and F ̸= F p.
Corollary 5.3.6. Every ﬁnite ﬁeld is perfect.
Proof. The characteristic of a ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a prime p. The monomorphism a 7→ap of F is an
isomorphism since F is ﬁnite. Hence, F = F p is perfect by Theorem 5.3.5.

5. Field Theory
We shall end this section by proving the “primitive element theorem” which is a classic of ﬁeld
theory. We ﬁrst recall that an extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is said to be a simple extension of F
if E = F(α) for some α ∈E. Such an element α is called a primitive element.
Theorem 5.3.7. If F is a ﬁeld and G is a ﬁnite subgroup of the multiplicative group of nonzero
elements of F, then G is a cyclic group. In particular, the multiplicative group of all nonzero
elements of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic.
Proof. If G = {1}, then G is cyclic. Assume that G ̸= {1}. Since G is a ﬁnite abelian group,
G ∼= Z/(m1) ⊕· · · ⊕Z/(mk)
where k ≥1, m1 > 1 and m1 | · · · | mk. Since mk(
k
X
i=1
Z/(mi)) = 0, u is a root of the polynomial
xmk −1 ∈F[x] for all u ∈G. By Theorem 5.1.1, this polynomial has at most mk distinct roots in
F, we must have k = 1 and G ∼= Z/(m1) which is a cyclic group.
Theorem 5.3.8. [Primitive Element Theorem] Let E be a ﬁnite separable extension of a ﬁeld F.
Then there exists α ∈E such that E = F(α). That is, a ﬁnite separable extension of a ﬁeld is a
simple extension.
Proof. If F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, then E is also ﬁnite. Let α be a generator for the cyclic group of all
nonzero elements of E under multiplication. Clearly, E = F[α], so α is a primitive element in this
case.
We now assume that F is inﬁnite and prove our theorem in the case that E = F(β, γ). The
induction argument from this to the general case is obvious. Let mβ,F (x) and mγ,F (x) be the
minimal polynomials over F of β and γ, respectively. Assume that mβ,F (x) has distinct roots β =
β1, . . . , βn and mγ,F (x) has distinct roots γ = γ1, . . . , γm in ¯F where all roots are of multiplicity 1,
since E is a separable extension of F. Since F is inﬁnite, we can ﬁnd a ∈F such that
a ̸= βi −β
γ −γj
for all i and j, with j ̸= 1. That is, a(γ −γj) ̸= βi −β. Letting α = β + aγ, we have α = β + aγ ̸=
βi + aγj, so
α −aγj ̸= βi
for all i and all j ̸= 1. Consider h(x) = mβ,F (α −ax) ∈F(α)[x]. Now, h(γ) = mβ,F (β) = 0.
However, h(γj) ̸= 0 for j ̸= 1 by construction, since the βi were the only roots of mβ,F (x). Hence,
h(x) and mγ,F (x) have a common factor in F(α)[x], namely the minimal polynomial of γ over
F(α), which must be linear, since γ is the only common root of mγ,F (x) and h(x). Thus, γ ∈F(α),
and therefore β = α −aγ is in F(α). Hence, F(β, γ) = F(α).
Exercises 5.3.
1. Suppose that F ⊆K ⊆E and that E is separable extension of F. Prove that E is
separable over K and K is separable over F.
2. Let F be of characteristic p and let a ∈F. Show that f(x) = xp −x −a has no multiple roots and
f(x) is irreducible in F[x] if and only if a ̸= cp −c for any c ∈F.

(b) The set of elements of K which generate the group of nonzero elements of K as an abelian group

p(x) = (x −α1)m(x −α2)m . . . (x −αk)m
for some m ∈N.
5.4
Automorphisms of Fields and Galois Theory
If F is a ﬁeld, the set of automorphisms of F, Aut F, forms a group under composition of func-
tions.
Examples 5.4.1 (Examples of automorphism groups).
1. Any automorphism satisﬁes ϕ(1) =
1, so ϕ(n) = n for all n ∈Z and ϕ(n/m) = n/m if n, m ∈Z and m ̸= 0 in F. This implies
that the ﬁelds Q and Fp = Z/(p) have only the identity map as an automorphism. That is,
Aut (F) = {idF } if F = Q or Fp. Moreover, any ﬁeld E is an extension of Q or Fp (so called
the prime subﬁeld) and any automorphism ϕ : E →E leaves the prime subﬁeld pointwise
ﬁxed.
2. The only automorphism ϕ : R →R is the identity map. For, we have known that ϕ(q) = q
for all q ∈Q. Note that ϕ(a) = ϕ((√a)2) = (ϕ(√a))2 > 0 for all a > 0. Thus, if a < b,
then ϕ(a) < ϕ(b). Let x ∈R. Suppose ϕ(x) ̸= x. Then ϕ(x) < x or ϕ(x) > x. If ϕ(x) < x,
then there exists a q ∈Q such that ϕ(x) < q < x. Thus, q = ϕ(q) < ϕ(x), a contradiction.
If x < ϕ(x), then there exists a q ∈Q such that x < q < ϕ(x), so ϕ(x) < ϕ(q) = q, a
contradiction. Hence, ϕ = id R.
3. Complex conjugation: ϕ(z) = ¯z is an automorphism of C of order two. In fact, Aut C
is uncountable, but the other automorphisms are “indescribable” and exist only via Zorn’s
lemma. However, the group of automorphisms of C which ﬁx all elements of R is a group
of order two.
4. Let F be a ﬁeld and let E = F(t) where t is transcendental over F. As shall be indicated in
the Exercise 5.4 below, u ∈E is a generator of E/F if and only if it has the form
u = αt + β
γt + δ ,
αδ −βγ ̸= 0.
Since an automorphism of E/F sends generators into generators, it follows that every au-
tomorphism ϕ : E →E is given by
ϕ(a) = a for all a ∈F
and
ϕ(t) = αt + β
γt + δ ,
where α, β, γ, δ ∈F and αδ −βγ ̸= 0. Note that if c ∈F and c ̸= 0, then
α
β
γ

and
cα

give rise to the same automorphism of F(t). A computation shows composition of functions
corresponds to matrix multiplication. The net result is that
Aut F(t) ∼= GL2(F)/F × = PGL2(F),
where F × is the set of matrices aI, a ̸= 0.
5. If F is a subﬁeld of K, let
Aut F K = {ϕ ∈Aut K : ϕ(a) = a for all a ∈F}.
The group structure of Aut F F(x, y) is known, but very complicated. For n ≥3, almost
nothing is known about Aut F F(x1, . . . , xn).

156
5. Field Theory
The above examples show that Aut F is in general very complicated and probably impossible
to describe. Galois theory proceeds in a different direction. One takes a subgroup H of Aut F—we
shall be almost concerned with ﬁnite H—and looks the set
F H = {a ∈F : ϕ(a) = a for all ϕ ∈H}.
It is easy to see that F H is a subﬁeld of F. Moreover, if K is a subgroup of H, then
1 ⊆K ⊆H
F ⊇F K ⊇F H.
The fundamental result of Galois theory is that of F is separable over F H, then there is a one-
to-one correspondence between subgroups of H and subﬁelds of F which contain F H. Such
correspondences are inclusion reversing and are called “Galois correspondences”.
Let E be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F. The Galois group of E over F denoted by Gal(E/F)
is the group
{ϕ ∈Aut E : ϕ(a) = a for all a ∈F}.
Let G be a subgroup of Aut E where E is a ﬁeld. Then the ﬁeld of G-invariant of E or the ﬁxed
ﬁeld of G acting on E is the ﬁeld
{a ∈E : ϕ(a) = a for all ϕ ∈G}.
It is denoted by EG or Inv G.
Theorem 5.4.1. (1) If Aut E ⊇G1 ⊇G2, then EG1 ⊆EG2.
(2) If E ⊇F1 ⊇F2, then Gal(E/F1) ⊆Gal(E/F2).
(3) If G = Gal(E/F), then EG ⊇F.
(4) If F = EG, then Gal(E/F) ⊇G.
Proof. These are immediate consequences of the deﬁnitions.
We shall now apply these ideas to splitting ﬁelds. Using the present terminology, Theorem
5.1.7 can be restated as follows.
If E is a splitting ﬁeld over F of a polynomial f(x), then
Gal(E/F) is ﬁnite and we have the inequality |Gal(E/F)| ≤[E : F]. Moreover, |Gal(E : F)| =
[E : F] if f(x) has distinct roots. We therefore have the following important preliminary result.
Lemma 5.4.2. Let E/F be a splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial contained in F[x]. Then
|Gal(E/F)| = [E : F].
Our next attack will be from the group side. We begin with an arbitrary ﬁeld E and any ﬁnite
group of automorphisms G acting in E. Then we have the following
Lemma 5.4.3. [Artin] Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of Aut E and let F = EG. Then
[E : F] ≤|G|.
Proof. Let |G| = n and write G = {g1 = 1, g2, . . . , gn}. We have to show that [E : F] ≤n, or
equivalently:
(∗) If x1, . . . , xn+1 ∈E, then there exist u1, . . . , un+1 ∈F not all zero, such that
u1x1 + · · · + un+1xn+1 = 0,

that is, x1, . . . , xn+1 are linearly dependent over F.

This matrix has rank ≤n, so there is a nonzero (n + 1) × 1 vector ⃗v = (v1, . . . , vn+1)t with entries
in E such that M⃗v = ⃗0(n+1)×1. We wish to ﬁnd such a vector where entries lie in F. Among
all such vectors with entries in E, choose one in which the number of nonzero coordinates, r, is
minimal. By renaming the elements x1, . . . , xn+1, we may suppose that the nonzero coordinates
are the ﬁrst r of them; by multiplying the vector by v−1
r
we may suppose that the last nonzero
coordinate is equal to 1. Thus,
M⃗v = ⃗0(n+1)×1
where
⃗v = (v1, . . . , vr−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0)t.
Claim. If h ∈G and h(⃗v) = (h(v1), . . . , h(vr−1), 1, 0, . . . , 0)t, then Mh(⃗v) = ⃗0.
Proof of Claim. The inner product of the j-th row of M with h(⃗v) is:
z = gj(x1)h(v1) + · · · + gj(xr−1)h(vr−1) + gj(xr) · 1.
Apply the automorphism h−1 to z,
h−1z = h−1gj(x1)h(v1) + · · · + h−1gj(xr−1)h(vr−1) + h−1gj(xr) · 1
= gi(x1)v1 + · · · + gi(xr−1)vr−1 + gi(xr) · 1 = 0,
since h−1gj = gi for some i. This proves the claim.
Now we consider, for any h ∈G
⃗v −h(⃗v) = (v1, . . . , vr−1, 1, 0, . . . , 0)t −(h(v1), . . . , h(vr−1), 1, 0, . . . , 0)t
= (
r−1
z }| {
∗, . . . , ∗, 0, . . . , 0)t.
Since M(⃗v −h(⃗v)) = ⃗0 and ⃗v −h(⃗v) has at most r −1 nonzero entries, ⃗v −h(⃗v) = ⃗0 by the minimal
choice of r. This means that for all h ∈G and i = 1, . . . , r −1, we have h(vi) = vi. Thus, all the vi
lie in EG = F and (u1, . . . , un+1) = (v1, . . . , vr−1, 0, . . . , 0) is a set of elements of F which satisﬁes
(∗).
Recall that an algebraic extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F is a separable extension if the minimal
polynomial of every element of E is separable. We call an algebraic extension ﬁeld E of a ﬁeld F
a normal extension if every irreducible polynomial in F[x] which has a root in E splits into
linear factors in E. This is equivalent to saying that E contains a splitting ﬁeld for the minimal
polynomial of every element of E. Normality plus separability, called a Galois extension, mean
that every irreducible polynomial of F[x] which has a root in E is a product of distinct linear
factors in E[x]. Also, by the results of the last section, if E is algebraic over F, then E is necessarily
separable over F if the characteristic is zero or if the characteristic is p > 0 and F p = F.
We are now ready to derive our main results, the ﬁrst of which gives two abstract character-
izations of splitting ﬁelds of separable polynomials and some important additional information.
We state this as

158
5. Field Theory
Theorem 5.4.4. Let E be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F. Then the following conditions on E/F
are equivalent.
(i) E is a splitting ﬁeld over F of a separable polynomial f(x).
(ii) F = EG for some ﬁnite group G of automorphisms of E.
(iii) E is ﬁnite dimensional Galois (normal and separable) over F.
Moreover, if E and F are as in (i) and G = Gal(E/F), then F = EG and if G and F are as in (ii),
then G = Gal(E/F).
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii). Let G = Gal(E/F). Then EG is a subﬁeld of E containing F. Also it is clear that
E is a splitting ﬁeld over EG of f(x) as well as over F and G = Gal(E/EG). Hence, by Lemma
5.4.2, |G| = [E : F] and |G| = [E : EG]. Since E ⊇EG ⊇F, we have [E : F] = [E : EG][EG : F].
Hence, [EG : F] = 1, and so EG = F. We have prove also that F = EG for G = Gal(E/F), which
is the ﬁrst of the two supplementary statements.
(ii) ⇒(iii). By Artin’s lemma, [E : F] ≤|G|, and so E is ﬁnite dimensional over F. Let f(x)
be an irreducible polynomial in F[x] having a root r in E. Let {r = r1, r2, . . . , rm} be the orbit of
r under the action of G. Thus, this is the set of distinct elements of the form σ(r), σ ∈G. Hence,
if σ ∈G, then the set {σ(r1), σ(r2), . . . , σ(rm)} is a permutation of {r1, r2, . . . , rm}. We have
f(r) = 0 which implies that f(ri) = 0. Then f(x) is divisible by x−ri, and since the ri, 1 ≤i ≤m,
are distinct, f(x) is divisible by g(x) = Qm
i=1(x −ri). We now apply to g(x) the automorphism
of E[x], which sends x →x and a →σ(a) for a ∈E. This gives σg(x) = Qm
i=1(x −σ(ri)) =
Qm
i=1(x −ri) = g(x).
Since this holds for every σ ∈G we see that the coefﬁcients of g(x)
are G-invariant. Hence, g(x) ∈F[x]. Since we assumed f(x) irreducible in F[x] we see that
f(x) = g(x) = Q(x −ri), a product of distinct linear factors in E[x]. Thus, E is separable and
normal over F and (iii) holds.
(iii) ⇒(i). Since we are given that [E : F] < ∞we can write E = F(r1, r2, . . . , rk) and each
ri is algebraic over F. Let fi(x) be the minimal polynomial of ri over F. Then the hypothesis
implies that fi(x) is a product of distinct linear factors in E[x]. It follows that f(x) = Qk
i=1 fi(x)
is separable and E = F(r1, r2, . . . , rk) is a splitting ﬁeld over F of f(x). Hence, we have (i).
It remains to prove the second supplementary statement. We have seen that under the hy-
pothesis of (ii) we have [E : F] ≤|G|, and that since (i) holds, we have |Gal(E/F)| = [E : F].
Since G ⊆Gal(E/F) and |G| ≥[E : F] = |Gal(E/F)|, equivalently G = Gal(E/F).
The above proof also yields
Corollary 5.4.5. If E/F is the splitting ﬁeld of f(x) ∈F[x] and r1, . . . , rn are distinct roots of
f(x) in E, then G = Gal(E/F) may be identiﬁed with a subgroup of Sn, the group of permutations
of {r1, . . . , rn}. However, it is not always the case that Gal(E/F) is the full group of permutations
of the roots of f(x).
There are two observations underlying the above corollary.
1. Each σ ∈G permutes r1, . . . , rn.
2. σ ∈G is determined by its action on r1, . . . , rn because r1, . . . , rn generate E as a ﬁeld over
F, i.e., E = F[r1, . . . , rn] = F(r1, . . . , rn).
Example 5.4.2 (Elementary symmetric functions). If K is a ﬁeld, then the polynomial ring
K[x1, . . . , xn] is an integral domain. The quotient ﬁeld of K[x1, . . . , xn] is denoted by K(x1, . . . , xn)
and is called the ﬁeld of rational functions in x1, . . . , xn over K. In the ﬁeld extension
K ⊂K(x1, . . . , xn)
each xi is easily seen to be transcendental over K. In fact, every element of K(x1, . . . , xn) not in
K itself is transcendental over K (Prove!).

5.4. Automorphisms of Fields and Galois Theory
159
Let Sn be the symmetric group on n letters. A rational function ϕ ∈K(x1, . . . , xn) is said to
be symmetric in x1, . . . , xn over K if for every σ ∈Sn,
ϕ(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ϕ(xσ(1), xσ(2), . . . , xσ(n)).
Trivially, every constant polynomial is a symmetric function. More generally, the elementary
symmetric functions in x1, . . . , xn over K are deﬁned to be the polynomials:
e1 = x1 + x2 + · · · + xn =
n
X
i=1
xi;
e2 =
X
1≤i<j≤n
xixj;
...
ek =
X
1≤i1<···<ik≤n
xi1xi2 . . . xik;
...
en = x1x2 . . . xn.
The veriﬁcation that the ei are indeed symmetric follows from the fact that they are simply the
coefﬁcients of t in the polynomial p(t) ∈K[x1, . . . , xn][t], where
p(t) = (t −x1)(t −x2) . . . (t −xn) = tn −e1tn−1 + e2tn−2 −· · · + (−1)n−1en−1t + (−1)nen.
If σ ∈Sn, then the assignments xi 7→xσ(i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n and
f(x1, . . . , xn)/g(x1, . . . , xn) 7→f(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n))/g(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n))
deﬁne a K-automorphism of the ﬁeld E = K(x1, . . . , xn) which will also be denoted σ. The
map Sn →Gal(E/K) given by σ 7→σ is clearly a monomorphism of groups, whence Sn may be
consider as a subgroup of the Galois group Gal(E/K). Clearly, the ﬁxed ﬁeld F = ESn consists
precisely of symmetric functions; that is, the set of all symmetric functions is a subﬁeld of E
containing K. Therefore, by Theorem 5.4.4, E is a Galois extension of F with Galois group
Gal(E/F) = Sn and dimension |Sn| = n!.
Example 5.4.3. Let K be a ﬁeld and x1, x2, x3 be indeterminates over K, set
e1 = x1 + x2 + x3, e2 = x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x1, e3 = x1x2x3
and consider the ﬁelds
F = K(e1, e2, e3) ⊆K(x1, x2, x3) = E.

We have already calculated that ES3 = EG = F and of course E{(1)} = E. It is not hard to verify
that
E⟨(12)⟩= F[x3], E⟨(13)⟩= F[x2], E⟨(23)⟩= F[x1].
It is somewhat more difﬁcult to verify that EA3 = F[∆] where
∆= (x1 −x2)(x2 −x3)(x3 −x1).
Note that σ(∆) = ∆if σ ∈A3, but σ(∆) = −∆if σ ∈S3 ∖A3.
We already know that
[F[x1] : F] = [F[x2] : F] = [F[x3] : F] = 3
and one can verify that [F[∆] : F] = 2. Thus, we get the following diagrams of all (by Galois
Theory) subﬁelds of E containing F
F = ES3
F[x3] = E⟨(12)⟩

E = E{(1)}
The indices are the same as in the lattice diagram for S3, but inclusions are reversed. Recall
that E is the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial
f(t) = (t −x1)(t −x2)(t −x3)
for any ﬁeld in the above diagram. More generally, it is clear that if M/L is a splitting ﬁeld for
f(t) ∈L[t] and M ⊇N ⊇L, then M/N is a splitting ﬁeld for f(t), regarded as a polynomial in
N[t].
Furthermore, for each ﬁeld L in the above diagram, we have L = EH for some subgroup H of
G = S3 and Gal(E/L) = H. On the other hand, things are not so nice for the extensions L/F. For
example, Gal(F[xi]/F) = 1 for all i = 1, 2, 3 and Gal(F[∆]/F) ∼= Z/(2) = ⟨ϕ⟩where the action of
ϕ is ϕ(∆) = −∆. Here ∆2 ∈F and F[∆] is the splitting ﬁeld of the polynomial t2 −∆2 over F, so
it is Galois. However, we may conclude that the ﬁelds F[x1], F[x2] and F[x3] are not the splitting
ﬁelds of any polynomials over F.
The previous example illustrates the fundamental theorem of Galois theory: if E/F is the
splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial f(t) ∈F[t], then the map
H ←→EH = {a ∈E : ϕ(a) = a for all ϕ ∈H}

5.4. Automorphisms of Fields and Galois Theory
161
is a 1-1 correspondence between
subgroups of Gal(E/F) ←→subﬁelds of E
which reverses inclusions. In addition, H is a normal subgroup of Gal(E/F) if and only if EH is
the splitting ﬁeld of some separable polynomial over F (i.e., EH is normal over F), and if H is
normal in Gal(E/F), then
Gal(EH/F) ∼= Gal(E/F)/H.
In our example, the only proper normal subgroup of S3 is A3, and
Gal(EA3/F) = Gal(F[∆]/F) ∼= Z2 ∼= S3/A3 = Gal(E/F)/A3.
We now formally establish Galois’ fundamental group-ﬁeld pairing as follows.
Theorem 5.4.6. [Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory] Let E be a ﬁnite dimensional Galois
extension of a ﬁeld F (i.e., the conditions of Theorem 5.4.4 holds) and let G = Gal(E/F). Let
Γ = {H}, the set of subgroups of G, and Σ, the set of intermediate ﬁelds between E and F (the
subﬁelds of E/F). Then the map H 7→EH and K 7→Gal(E/K), H ∈Γ, K ∈Σ, are inverses
to each other. In particular, they are one-to-one correspondences between Γ and Σ. Moreover, the
pairing Γ ↔Σ has the following properties:
1. H1 ⊇H2 if and only if EH1 ⊆EH2.
2. |H| = [E : EH] and [G : H] = [EH : F] = [EH : EG].
3. H is normal in G if and only if EH is normal over F. In this case,
Gal(EH/F) ∼= G/H.
This is the main theorem. Most of our remaining ﬁeld theory will be consequences of it.
Proof. Let H be a subgroup of G = Gal(E/F). Since F = EG, F ⊆EH and EH is thus a subﬁeld
of E containing F. Also, E/EH is Galois. Applying the second supplementary result of Theorem
5.4.4 to H in place of G we see that Gal(E/EH) = H. By Lemma 5.4.2, |H| = |Gal(E/EH)| =
[E : EH]. Now let K be any subﬁeld of E/F. Then Gal(E/K) ⊆G = Gal(E/F), so Gal(E/K)
is a subgroup of G. It is clear also that E is a splitting ﬁeld over K of a separable polynomial.
Hence, the ﬁrst supplementary result of Theorem 5.4.4 applied to the pair E and K shows that
K = EGal(E/K). We have now shown that the speciﬁed maps between Γ and Σ are inverses.
Also, we know that if H1 ⊇H2, then EH1 ⊆EH2. Moreover, if EH1 ⊆EH2, then we have also
that H1 = Gal(E/EH1) ⊇Gal(E/EH2) = H2. Hence, (1) holds. The ﬁrst part of (2) was noted
before. Since |G| = [E : F] = [E : EH][EH : F] = |H|[EH : F] and |G| = |H|[G : H], evidently
[EH : F] = [G : H]. This proves (2).
If H ∈Γ, then EηHη−1 = η(EH) for all η ∈G. This is clear since the condition σ(x) = x is
equivalent to (ηση−1)(η(x)) = η(x). It now follows that H is normal in G if and only if η(EH) =
EH for every η ∈G. Suppose H is normal in G. Then every η ∈G maps EH onto itself and so its
restriction ¯η = η|EH is an automorphism of EH/F. Thus, we have the restriction homomorphism
η →¯η of G = Gal(E/F) into Gal(EH/F). The image ¯G is a group of automorphisms in EH and
clearly (EH) ¯G = F. Hence, ¯G = Gal(EH/F). The kernel of the homomorphism η →¯η is the set of
η ∈G such that η|EH = idEH. By the pairing, this is Gal(E/EH) = H. Hence, the kernel is H and
¯G = Gal(EH/F) ∼= G/H. Since F = (EH) ¯G, EH is normal over F by Theorem 5.4.4. Conversely,
suppose EH is normal over F. Let a ∈EH and let f(x) be the minimal polynomial of a over F.
Then f(x) = (x−a1) . . . (x−am) in EH[x] where a = a1. If η ∈G, then f(η(a)) = 0 which implies
that η(a) = ai for some i. Thus, η(a) ∈EH. We have therefore shown that η(EH) = EH. Hence,
H is a normal subgroup of G. This completes the proof of (3).

Exercises 5.4.
1. Let E = F(t) where t is transcendental over F and write any non-zero element
of E as u = f(t)/g(t) where (f(t), g(t)) = 1. Call the maximum of degrees of f and g the degree
of u. Show that if x and y are indeterminates then f(x) −yg(x) is irreducible in F[x, y] and hence
is irreducible in F(y)[x]. Show that t is algebraic over F(u) with minimal polynomial the monic
polynomial which is a multiple in F(u) of f(x) −ug(x). Hence, conclude that [F(t) : F(u)] = 1, and
F(u) = F(t) if and only if deg u = 1. Note that this implies

Some Consequences of Galois Theory
In this section, we shall derive some consequences of Galois theory including another proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra.

5.5. Some Consequences of Galois Theory
163
Theorem 5.5.1. Let K be a ﬁnite dimensional separable extension of a ﬁeld F. Then there are
only ﬁnitely many ﬁelds L such that K ⊇L ⊇F.
Proof. Since K/F is ﬁnite separable, by primitive element theorem, K = F[α] for some α ∈K.
Let E be the splitting ﬁeld of mα,F (x). Then E is Galois over F and E ⊆K ⊆F. By fundamental
theorem of Galois theory, the number of intermediate ﬁelds between E and F is the number of
subgroups of Gal(E/F). Hence, the number of intermediate ﬁelds between K and F is at most
the number of subgroups of Gal(E/F).
Remark. If G = Gal(E/F), then K = EH for some subgroup H of G and the ﬁelds L such that
K ⊇L ⊇F are in 1-1 correspondence with the subgroups J of G such that G ⊇J ⊇H.
The primitive element theorem and the previous theorem both fail for inseparable extensions
as shown in the following example.
Example 5.5.1. Let F be an inﬁnite ﬁeld of prime characteristic p and let u and v be indetermi-
nates over F. Consider
F(u, v) ⊇F(up, vp)
It is easy to see that [F(u, v) : F(up, vp)] = p2. On the other hand, if z ∈F(u, v), then zp ∈
F(up, vp), so
[F(up, vp)(z) : F(up, vp)] ≤p.
Hence, there is no z such that F(u, v) = F(up, vp)(z), that is, no primitive element.
On the other hand, the nonexistence of a primitive element shows that the ﬁelds
F(up, vp)(u + αv),
for α ∈F, are all distinct. To see this, assume that F(up, vp)(u + αv) = F(up, vp)(u + βv) = E for
some α ̸= β in E. Then u + αv and u + βv in E, so
α(u + βv) −β(u + αv) = (α −β)u ∈E.
Since α −β ̸= 0, u is in E which implies that v is also in E. Thus, E = F(u, v), a contradiction.
Hence, there are inﬁnitely many ﬁelds L such that F(u, v) ⊃L ⊃F(up, vp).
Let us now recall some concepts from group theory. Suppose a group G acts on a set S. The
action is transitive if for any s, t ∈S there is a g ∈G such that gs = t.
Remark. The action of G being transitive simply means that the action of G on S has only one
orbit. Assuming G acts transitively on S. let s ∈S and let
H = {g ∈G : gs = s}
be the stabilizer of s. Then S can be identiﬁed with the set of left cosets
{gH : g ∈G},
with G acting by left multiplication. Note that the subgroup H depends on the choice of s and
choosing a different s will give a conjugate of H. More precisely, if s ∈S and x ∈G, and
H = stabilizer of s = {g ∈G : gs = s}
then
xHx−1 = stabilizer of xs = {g ∈G : g(xs) = xs}.
(If gs = s, then (xgx−1)(xs) = xs.)
A basic example of this phenomenon is the action of Sn on {1, 2, . . . , n}. The stabilizer of
i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is Sym{1, . . . , i −1, i + 1, . . . , n} which may be identiﬁed with Sn−1, but Sn−1 has
n conjugates in Sn.

Theorem 5.5.2. Let E be the splitting ﬁeld over F of a separable polynomial f(x) ∈F[x] which is
irreducible over F. Then Gal(E/F) acts transitively on the roots of f(x). Hence, Gal(E/F) may
be identiﬁed with a subgroup of Sym{r1, . . . , rn} which acts transitively on {r1, . . . , rn}, the roots
of f(x) in E.
Proof. This is implicit in the proof of Theorem 5.1.6. For, if r and s are roots of f(x) in E, then
F(r) ∼= F[x]/(f(x)) ∼= F(s)
with
r 7→x + (f(x)) 7→s
by an isomorphism which ﬁxes F pointwise. Let η : F(r) →F(s) be this isomorphism. By
Theorem 5.1.6, η extends to an isomorphism ˆη : E →E. Then ˆη ∈Gal(E/F) and ˆη(r) = s, which
is what we need to prove.
Remarks.
1. The hypothesis that f(x) be irreducible over F is essential. For, example, if
f(x) = f1(x) . . . fk(x) where f1(x), . . . , fk(x) are distinct irreducible polynomials, then all
one can say is that Gal(E/F) permutes the roots of each fi(x) among themselves. It is still
true that Gal(E/F) can be identiﬁed with a subgroup of the group of permutations of the
roots, but not a transitive one.
2. Assume that f(x) is irreducible and separable over F of degree n, E/F is a splitting ﬁeld
for f(x) over F and r is one root of f(x). Then the fundamental theorem of Galois theory
gives the following picture
E
{id E}
F[r]
n
Gal(E/F[r]) = H
n
F
Gal(E/F).
Thus, F[r] = EH where H is a subgroup of index n in G.
The basic Theorems 5.1.4 and 5.1.6 give the existence and uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds. That
is, if F is a ﬁeld and f(x) is a monic polynomial in F[x], then
1. A splitting ﬁeld E for f(x) exists. E is generated over F by the roots of f(x) and f(x) splits
into linear factors in E[x].
2. The splitting ﬁeld E/F is unique up to isomorphism over F. In other words, if E′/F is
another splitting ﬁeld for f(x) over F, then there is an isomorphism
ϕ : E →E′
which is identity on F.
What does this means if we are searching for the splitting ﬁeld of some f(x) ∈Q[x]?
It means that we can realize E as a subﬁeld of C. More precisely, f(x) is a product of linear
factors in C[x], say f(x) = (x−α1) . . . (x−αk) and we can take E to be the ﬁeld Q(α1, . . . , αk) ⊆C.
This could be very helpful because it allows us to work in a concrete and explicit ﬁeld.
The fundamental theorem of algebra (every f(x) ∈C[x] is a product of linear factors) is usually
proved in complex analysis and there is also a topological proof. Here we present a proof based
on Galois theory and the intermediate value theorem from real analysis or calculus. We shall start
with some basic results.
Theorem 5.5.3. Let f(x) ∈R[x] be a polynomial of odd degree. Then f(x) has a root in R.

5.5. Some Consequences of Galois Theory
165
Proof. It is enough to prove for a monic polynomial
f(x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
with ai ∈R and n is odd. If a = |a0| + · · · + |an−1|, then it is easy to see that f(a) > 0 and
f(−a) < 0. By intermediate value theorem (because f(x) is continuous), there exists r ∈R such
that f(r) = 0.
Consider α + βi with α, β ∈R. If γ =
p
α2 + β2, then
(
p
(γ + α)/2 + i
p
(γ −α)/2)2 = α + βi.
Hence, we have proved
Theorem 5.5.4. Every complex number has a square root.
Theorem 5.5.5. If K is a ﬁeld containing C, then [K : C] ̸= 2.
Proof. Suppose conversely that [K : C] = 2 and let K = C + Cu for some u ∈K. Then u satisﬁes
a polynomial
f(x) = x2 −bx + c
of degree two over C, since 1, u, u2 are linearly dependent over C. The roots of f(x) are
−b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2
which lie in C, since every element of C has a square root in C. Thus, u ∈C, a contradiction.
Recall that a ﬁnite p-group G is nilpotent, so by Exercise 3.3, a maximal subgroup M of G is
normal and [G : M] = p, i.e., if G is a nontrivial ﬁnite p-group, then G has a normal subgroup of
index p.
Theorem 5.5.6. [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra] Let f(x) ∈C[x]. Then f(x) is a product of
linear factors in C[x].
Proof. Let ¯: C →C denote the complex conjugation. Then g(x) = f(x)f(x) ∈R[x]. Let E be a
splitting ﬁeld for g(x)(x2 + 1) over R and identify C with the subﬁeld of E generated by the roots
of x2 + 1. Since the characteristic is zero, all polynomials are separable, so E is the splitting ﬁeld
of a separable polynomial. Hence, E is Galois over R by Theorem 5.4.4.
Let G = Gal(E/R), |G| = 2am, where m is odd, and let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.

Thus, EP = {α ∈E : ϕ(α) = α for all ϕ ∈P} is an extension of R of odd degree m, by the
fundamental Galois correspondence. If u ∈EP , the minimal polynomial q(x) of u over R is an
irreducible polynomial in R[x] of odd degree, so it has a root in R by Theorem 5.5.3. Since q(x)
is irreducible, it has degree one. Hence, EP = R and G = P, so |G| = 2a. By the fundamental

subgroup K of index 2, so

Thus, [EK : C] = 2 which contradicts Theorem 5.5.5. Hence, |G| = 2, H = {1} and C = EH = E.
Therefore, C is a splitting ﬁeld for g(x)(x2 + 1) = f(x)f(x)(x2 + 1) over R, so g(x)(x2 + 1) (and
hence f(x)) splits into linear factors in C[x].
The fundamental theorem of algebra was ﬁrst rigorously proved by Gauss in 1816 (his doctoral
dissertation in 1798 provides a proof using geometric considerations requiring some topological
justiﬁcation). There was a proof due to Laplace in 1795. However, Laplace’s proof was deemed
unacceptable because he assumed the existence of a splitting ﬁeld for polynomials (i.e., that the
roots existed somewhere in some ﬁeld), which had not been established at that time. The elegant
above proof was given by Artin.
5.6
Finite Fields
Let k be a ﬁeld of q elements. Then (k, +) is an abelian group, so q · 1 = 0. Thus, F is of
characteristic prime p > 0 and p | q, so it contains Z/pZ as a subﬁeld and it is a ﬁnite extension
of Z/pZ. Its cardinality |k| = q = pd is a power of p, with d = [k : Z/pZ]. This also indicates that
the additive group of k is a direct sum of d copies of cyclic group of order p. We shall restate the
following fact (Theorem 5.3.7).
Theorem 5.6.1. k× is cyclic of order q −1.
Some immediate consequences of the above theorem are as follows.
Corollary 5.6.2. The ﬁeld k consists of the solutions to xq −x = 0 in an algebraic closure of Z/pZ
containing k.
Corollary 5.6.3. There is an element α ∈k such that k = (Z/pZ)[α], that is, k is a simple
extension of the prime ﬁeld Z/pZ.
Corollary 5.6.4. For each positive divisor r of q −1(= |k×|) there are exactly φ(r) elements in k×
of order r.
Corollary 5.6.5. Let p be a prime and d a positive integer. Then, up to isomorphism, there is
exactly one ﬁeld of order q = pd.
Proof. Let E be a splitting ﬁeld of f(t) = tpd −t over Z/pZ in an algebraic closure of Z/pZ. By
Theorem 5.1.6, E is unique up to isomorphism. It consists of the roots of tpd = t in the algebraic
closure of Z/pZ. Thus, |E| is the number of roots of tpd −t. Since f′(t) = −1, f(t) is separable, so
|E| = pd. Thus, we have constructed a ﬁeld of order q = pd, namely E, the splitting ﬁeld of f(t)
over Z/pZ.
For q = pd, we may write Fq for the (unique up to isomorphism) ﬁeld of q elements. Also, we
may write Fp for Z/pZ.

5.6. Finite Fields
167
Corollary 5.6.6. Given any positive integer d, there exists an irreducible polynomial of degree n
over Fp.
Proof. By Corollary 5.6.3, Fpd = Fp[α] for some α ∈Fpd. Let f(t) be the minimal polynomial of α
over Fp. Then Fpd = Fp[α] ∼= Fp[t]/(f(t)) shows deg f(t) = [Fpd : Fp] = d.
Next, we shall study ﬁnite extensions of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. For simplicity, k stands for the ﬁnite
ﬁeld Fq. Let kn be a degree n ﬁeld extension of k. If km is an intermediate ﬁeld of degree m
over k, then kn is a vector space over km, so m divides n. Conversely, any degree m extension of
k within an algebraic closure of k with m | n is a subﬁeld of kn by Corollary 5.6.2 since m | n
implies (qm −1) | (qn −1).
Consider the map σ on kn which sends x to xq. From
σ(x + y) = (x + y)q = xq + yq = σ(x) + σ(y) and σ(xy) = (xy)q = xqyq = σ(x)σ(y),
we see that σ is an endomorphism. Furthermore, σ(x) = xq = 0 implies x = 0. So σ is one-to-one.
As kn is ﬁnite, we have shown that σ is an automorphism of kn. Finally, σ(x) = xq = x for x ∈k,
this shows that σ ∈Gal(kn/k), called the Frobenius’ automorphism. Let r be the order of σ.
Then
σr(x) = xqr = x for all x ∈kn
implies r = n since k×
n is cyclic of order qn −1. Hence, Gal(kn/k) contains the cyclic group ⟨σ⟩of
order n. Since |Gal(kn/k)| ≤[kn : k] = n, Gal(kn/k) = ⟨σ⟩and so the ﬁeld kn is Galois over k.
We record this in
Theorem 5.6.7. The ﬁeld kn is Galois over k with the Galois group Gal(kn/k) cyclic of order n,
generated by the Frobenius’ automorphism σ.
Note that an element x ∈kn lies in k if and only if it satisﬁes xq = x, in other words, if and
only if it is ﬁxed by the Frobenius’ automorphism, or equivalently, by the group Gal(kn/k). Using
G = Gal(kn/k), we deﬁne two important maps, called trace and norm, denoted by Trkn/k and
Nkn/k, respectively, from kn to k as follows:
Trkn/k : x 7→
X
τ∈G
τ(x) =
n
X
i=1
σi(x),
Nkn/k : x 7→
Y
τ∈G
τ(x) =
n
Y
i=1
σi(x).
One check easily that the images of trace and norm maps are in k. It is clear that Trkn/k is a
homomorphism from the additive group kn to the additive group k and Nkn/k is a homomorphism
from k×
n to k×. Next we investigate their images. We shall ﬁrst need
Lemma 5.6.8. If E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F, then the automorphisms in Gal(E/F) are
E-linearly independent F-linear transformations.
Proof. Suppose otherwise. Let a1τ1 + · · · + arτr = 0 be a shortest nontrivial linear relation with
a1, . . . , ar ∈E× and τ1, . . . , τr ∈Gal(E/F). Then r ≥2 and τi are distinct. Let y ∈E be such that
τ1(y) ̸= τ2(y). From Pr
i=1 aiτi = 0 we get

which is shorter than the relation we started with, a contradiction.
Theorem 5.6.9. [Hilbert Theorem 90]
1. The norm map Nkn/k from k×
n to k× is surjective with the kernel consisting of x/σ(x), x ∈k×
n .
2. The trace map Trkn/k from kn to k is surjective with the kernel consisting of x−σ(x), x ∈kn.
Proof. (1) Since Nkn/k(σ(x)) = Qn
i=1 σi+1(x) = Qn
i=1 σi(x) = Nkn/k(x), so x/σ(x) lies in the
kernel of the norm map for all x ∈k×
n . Further, x/σ(x) = y/σ(y) if and only if xy−1 ∈k×, hence
the elements x/σ(x) with x ∈k×
n form a subgroup of k×
n of order (qn −1)/(q −1). Thus, it is equal
to the whole kernel if and only if the norm map is surjective. To see Nkn/k is onto, observe that
Nkn/k(x) =
n
Y
i=1
σi(x) = x · xq · xq2 · · · · · xqn−1 = x1+q+q2+···+qn−1 = x(qn−1)/(q−1)
for all x ∈k×
n . Hence, any generator x of k×
n has Nkn/k(x) of order q −1.
(2) Since elements in Gal(kn/k) are k-linear maps, the image of Trkn/k(kn) is a vector space
over k, hence Trkn/k(kn) = 0 or k.
If Trkn/k = 0, then Pn
i=1 σi = 0, which is a nontrivial
linear relation among elements of Gal(kn/k), so impossible by Lemma 5.6.8. Therefore, Trkn/k
is surjective. Then its kernel has order qn−1. Clearly, Trkn/k(σ(x)) = Trkn/k(x) so that kernel
contains x −σ(x) for all x ∈kn. Further, x −σ(x) = y −σ(y) if and only if x −y ∈k, so the group
{x −σ(x) : x ∈kn} has order qn/q, thus is equal to the kernel.
Remark. The Hilbert Theorem 90 for norm and trace maps is usually proved using ﬁrst cohomol-
ogy group of the Galois group (à la Noether). When the base ﬁeld is ﬁnite, we may use counting
argument, as shown above.
Given z ∈kn, it deﬁnes a k-linear transformation Lz on kn by x 7→zx, that is, multiplication
by z. The trace and determinant of Lz are deﬁned as the trace and determinant of any n × n
matrix representing Lz. They are in fact given by Trkn/k and Nkn/k of z. More precisely, we have
Theorem 5.6.10. Let z ∈kn and deﬁne Lz as above. Then
1. Tr Lz = Trkn/k(z) and det Lz = Nkn/k(z).
2. Suppose k(z) = kn. Let f(t) = tn + a1tn−1 + · · · + an−1t + an be the minimal polynomial
of z over k. Then
a1 = −Trkn/k(z)
and
an = (−1)nNkn/k(z).
Proof. We shall prove (1) and (2) under the assumption (2) and leave (1) for the case k(z) being
a proper subﬁeld kn as an exercise. For each τ ∈Gal(kn/k), 0 = τ(f(z)) = f(τ(z)), hence
τ(z) is also a root of f(x). Further, if τ and τ ′ are two different elements in Gal(kn/k), then
τ(z) ̸= τ ′(z) (otherwise they would agree on k(z) = kn). This shows that z has n distinct images
under Gal(kn/k) and they are the roots of f(t). Therefore,
−a1 = the sum of roots of f(t) = Trkn/k(z)
and
(−1)nan = the product of roots of f(t) = Nkn/k(z).

5.6. Finite Fields
169
This proves (2). For (1), we know that Lz satisﬁes f(t) = 0. As f(t) is irreducible over k and
[kn : k] = n, f(t) is the characteristic polynomial of Lz. The companion matrix attached to Lz is

Cyclotomic Extensions
In this section, we shall study other important examples of Galois extension, called cyclotomic
ﬁelds, and compute their Galois groups. Note that “Cyclotomy” is Greek for the art of dividing a
circle into equal parts.
Theorem 5.7.1. Let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 and let E be a splitting ﬁeld of xn −1 over K.
Then Gal(E/K) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut Z/(n) ∼= (Z/(n))×. In particular, Gal(E/K)
is abelian.
Proof. Since (xn −1)′ = nxn−1 ̸= 0, the roots of xn −1 (in E) are distinct, say
xn −1 = (x −1)(x −α2) . . . (x −αn).
Then A = {z ∈E : zn = 1} = {1, α2, . . . , αn} is a ﬁnite subgroup of E×, so it is cyclic of order n by
Theorem 5.3.7. Any automorphism of E, θ : E →E induces an automorphism θ : A →A, so there
is a group homomorphism from Gal(E/K) to Aut A deﬁned by θ 7→θ|A. This homomorphism is
1-1 since any automorphism of E/K is completely determined by its action on the roots of xn −1.
Hence, Gal(E/K) is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut A = Aut Z/(n).
We call a Galois extension ﬁeld E/F abelian [cyclic] over F if Gal(E/F) is abelian [cyclic].
Hence, the above theorem provides an example of abelian extension.
Our next objective is to show that if E is a splitting ﬁeld of xn −1 over Q, then Gal(E/Q) ∼=
Aut Z/(n) ∼= (Z/(n))×. We ﬁrst recall some properties of the cyclic group of order n. Let Z/(n) =
⟨a⟩. Then
1. For each divisor d of n, Z/(n) has a unique subgroup of order d, generated by an/d.
2. All subgroups of Z/(n) are as in (1). Thus, the number of subgroups of Z/(n) is equal to
the number of divisors of n.
3. If x, y ∈Z/(n), then
⟨x⟩= ⟨y⟩⇐⇒o(x) = o(y)
⇐⇒θ(x) = y for some θ ∈Aut Z/(n)
⇐⇒x and y lie in the same orbit under the action of Aut Z/(n).
An element ω in a ﬁeld K is an nth root of unity if ωn = 1, it is a primitive nth root of unity
if o(ω) = n in K×, that is, ωn = 1 and ωm ̸= 1 if 1 ≤m < n. In the complex numbers C, the nth
roots of unity are the powers of
ω = e2πi/n = cos(2π/n) + i sin(2π/n) and ωt = e2πit/n = cos(2πt/n) + i sin(2πt/n).
Thus, Q[ω] is the splitting ﬁeld of xn −1 over Q, so [Q[ω] : Q] is the degree of the minimal
polynomial of ω over Q. We know that the set U of the nth roots of unity is a cyclic group of
order n under multiplication. Hence, the number of primitive nth roots of 1, that is, the number
of generators of U, is φ(n).
For a positive integer d and x an indeterminate, the dth cyclotomic polynomial, Φd(x) is the
product
Φd(x) =
Y
{(x −ε) : ε is a primitive dth root of unity}.
If η ∈Gal(Q[ω]/Q) and z is primitive nth root of unity, then η(z) is primitive.
Hence,
η(Φn(x)) = Φn(x) and so Φn(x) ∈Q[x]. It is clear that Φn(x) | (xn −1) and, in fact, since
any nth root of unity has an order d | n we see that
xn −1 =
Y
d|n
Φd(x).
(5.7.1)

5.7. Cyclotomic Extensions
171
Remark. The formula (5.7.1) provides us with an algorithm for calculating the polynomial Φn(x).
To begin with we have
Φ1(x) = x −1
and assuming we already know the Φd(x) for proper divisors d of n then (5.7.1) gives us Φn(x).
For example, for a prime p, Φ1(x)Φp(x) = xp −1, so we get
Φp(x) = xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1.
Then Φ2(x) = x + 1 and Φ3(x) = x2 + x + 1, so
Φ4(x) =
x4 −1
Φ1(x)Φ2(x) = x2 + 1
Φ6(x) =
x6 −1
Φ1(x)Φ2(x)Φ3(x) = x2 −x + 1
Φ12(x) =
x12 −1
Φ1(x)Φ2(x)Φ3(x)Φ4(x)Φ6(x) = x4 −x2 + 1.
Next, we observe that Φn(x) has integer coefﬁcients. This holds for n = 1 and assuming it
holds for every Φd(x), d < n, we have xn−1 = Φn(x)g(x) where g(x) = Q
d|n;d<n Φd(x) is a monic
polynomial with integer coefﬁcients. The division algorithm gives integral polynomials q(x) and
r(x) with deg r(x) < deg g(x) such that xn −1 = q(x)g(x) + r(x). Since q(x) and r(x) are unique
in Z[x] and xn −1 = Φn(x)g(x) in Q[x], we see that Φn(x) = q(x) ∈Z[x].
We shall now prove
Theorem 5.7.2. The nth cyclotomic polynomial Φn(x) has integer coefﬁcients and is an irreducible
polynomial in Q[x].
Proof. Suppose that Φn(x) = h(x)k(x), where h(x), k(x) ∈Z[x] and h(x) is irreducible in Z[x],
hence, in Q[x] (Gauss’ lemma).
We may also assume that h(x) and k(x) are monic and so
deg h(x) ≥1. Let p be a prime integer not dividing n and let δ be a root of h(x). Since (p, n) = 1, δp
is a primitive nth root of unity. Assume that δp is not a root of h(x). Then δp is a root of k(x); con-
sequently δ is a root of k(xp). Since h(x) is irreducible and has δ as a root also, (h(x), k(xp)) ̸= 1
and thus h(x) | k(xp). It follows (as mentioned earlier) that k(xp) = h(x)l(x), where l(x) is monic
with integral coefﬁcients. Since xn −1 = Φn(x)g(x), we have xn −1 = h(x)k(x)g(x). We now
pass to congruences modulo p or, which is the same thing, to equations in (Z/(p))[x]. This gives
xn −¯1 = ¯h(x)¯k(x)¯g(x)
(5.7.2)
where, in general, if f(x) = a0xm +a1xm−1 +· · ·+am ∈Z[x], then ¯f(x) = ¯a0xm + ¯a1xm−1 +· · ·+
¯am, ¯ai = ai + (p) in Z/(p). Similarly, we have ¯k(xp) = ¯h(x)¯l(x). Now, using ¯ap = ¯a for any a ∈Z,
we see that
¯f(x)p = (¯a0xm + ¯a1xm−1 + · · · + ¯am)p
= ¯ap
0xpm + ¯ap
1xp(m−1) + · · · + ¯ap
m
= ¯a0xpm + ¯a1xp(m−1) + · · · + ¯am
= ¯f(xp)
for any f(x) ∈Z[x]. Thus, ¯k(x)p = ¯k(xp) = ¯h(x)¯l(x) which implies that (¯h(x), ¯k(x)) ̸= 1. Then
(5.7.2) shows that xn −¯1 has multiple roots in its splitting ﬁeld over Z/(p). Since the derivative
(xn−¯1)′ = ¯nxn−1 and ¯n ̸= 0, we have (xn−¯1, (xn−¯1)′) = ¯1, contrary to the derivative criterion for
multiple roots. This contradiction shows that δp is a root of h(x) for every prime p ̸ |n. A repetition
of this shows that δr is a root of h(x) for every integer r prime to n. Since every primitive nth root
of 1 has the form δr, (r, n) = 1, we see that h(x) is divisible by every x −δ′, δ′ primitive. Hence,
h(x) = Φn(x) and Φn(x) is irreducible in Q[x].

5. Field Theory
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.7.2, we get
Theorem 5.7.3. Let ω be a primitive nth root of unity. Then
1. Φn(x) is the minimal polynomial of ω over Q.
2. [Q[ω] : Q] = deg Φn(x) = φ(n), the Euler’s φ-function.
3. Q[ω] is the splitting ﬁeld of Φn(x) over Q.
4. Gal(Q[ω]/Q) ∼= (Z/(n))×.
Proof. (1), (2) and (3) are obvious. To prove (4), recall that by Theorem 5.7.1, Gal(Q[ω]/Q)
is isomorphic to a subgroup of (Z/(n))×. Since [Q[ω] : Q] = φ(n) = |(Z/(n))×|, it must be
isomorphic to all of (Z/(n))×.
Theorem 5.7.3 implies that Gal(Q[ω]/Q) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group Un of units
of the ring Z/(n). If n is a prime then we know that this is a cyclic group of order p−1. Moreover, if
n = pe1
1 pe2
2 . . . pes
s , pi distinct primes, then Un is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups Upei.
In addition, we know the structures of Upe from the knowledge of primitive roots in number theory
as follows.
Theorem 5.7.4. [Structure of Upe]
1. U2 and U4 are cyclic and if e > 3, then U2e is a direct product of a cyclic group of order 2 and
one of order 2e−2.
2. If p is an odd prime, the multiplicative group Upe of units of Z/(pe) is cyclic.
Example 5.7.1. If ω = e2πi/72 is a primitive 72nd root of unity, then
Gal(Q[ω]/Q) ∼= U72 ∼= Z/(2) × Z/(2) × Z/(6).
A ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁeld extension of Q is called a cyclotomic ﬁeld if it is a subﬁeld of Q[ω]
for some root of unity ω.
Theorem 5.7.5. Let K be a cyclotomic ﬁeld. Then K is Galois over Q and Gal(K/Q) is abelian.
Proof. Consider Q ⊂K ⊂Q[ω] for some nth root of unity ω. By the fundamental theorem of
Galois theory K = Q[ω]H for some subgroup H of G = Gal(Q[ω]/Q) ∼= (Z/(n))×. Since G is
abelian, H is normal in G, so the fundamental theorem says that K is Galois over Q with Galois
group G/H, an abelian group.
Remark. A deep theorem of Kronecker and Weber says that the converse of Theorem 5.7.5 is
true, namely, “if K is Galois over Q and Gal(K/Q) is abelian, then K is a cyclotomic ﬁeld, that is,
K ⊂Q[ω] for some root of unity ω.”
Example 5.7.2. Let ω = e2πi/71 be a primitive 71st root of unity. Then
G = Gal(Q[ω]/Q) ∼= U71 ∼= Z/(70) ∼= Z/(2) × Z/(5) × Z/(7).
Let H = Z/(2) × Z/(5) be the subgroup of G of order 10. Then H is normal in G and conse-
quently we have Q[ω]H is a Galois extension over Q of degree [Q[ω]H : Q] = [G : H] = 7 and
Gal(Q[ω]H/Q) ∼= G/H ∼= Z/(7).
We now have enough tools to ﬁnd the Galois groups of splitting ﬁelds of irreducible separable
polynomials xn −a. Note that (xn −a)′ = nxn−1, so xn −a is separable over a ﬁeld F if and only
if char F ̸ |n. In particular, if F contains a primitive nth root of unity, then char F ̸ |n.

5.7. Cyclotomic Extensions
173
Theorem 5.7.6. Let F be a ﬁeld which contains a primitive nth root of unity ω, i.e., char F not
divide n. Let a ∈F, f(x) = xn −a, E the splitting ﬁeld for E over F and r a root of f(x) in E.
Then
(1) The factorization of f(x) in E[x] is
xn −a = (x −r)(x −ωr) . . . (x −ωn−1r)
and E = F[r].
(2) Let d be the least positive integer such that rd = b ∈F. Then d divides n and
xd −b = (x −r)(x −εr) . . . (x −εd−1r)
is the minimal polynomial of r over F where ε = ωn/d, a primitive dth root of unity. In addition,
[E : F] = d and Gal(E/F) ∼= Z/(d). The automorphism α : E →E deﬁned by α(r) = εr
generates Gal(E/F).
Proof. (1) Since r, ωr, . . . , ωn−1r are all roots of xn −a, (x −r)(x −ωr) . . . (x −ωn−1r) must
divide xn −a. Since both polynomials are monic of degree n, they must be equal. Also, ω ∈F
by hypothesis, so F[r] contains all the roots of xn −a and is generated over F by them. Hence,
E = F[r] by the deﬁnition of splitting ﬁeld.
(2) Since d is the generator of the group {m ∈Z : rm ∈F} and n is in this group, d divides n.
Certainly, r is a root of xd −b ∈F[x]. If xd −b had a proper factor of degree c, 0 < c < d, looking
at its constant term would show that rc ∈F, contradicting the minimality of d. Thus, xd −b is
irreducible. Hence, [E : F] = [F[r] : F] = d, so |Gal(E/F)| = d. On the other hand, one sees that
αi(r) = εir, so α is an element of Gal(E/F) of order d. Therefore, Gal(E/F) = ⟨α⟩∼= Z/(d).
For the sake of clarity, we reformulate Theorem 5.7.6 slightly to emphasize the case where
f(x) is irreducible, which is the important one.
Theorem 5.7.7. Let F be a ﬁeld which contains a primitive nth root of unity ω and let a ∈F.
Then xn −a is irreducible if and only if no divisor d of n, d ̸= 1, such that a = bd for some b ∈F.
If xn −a is irreducible and E/F is its splitting ﬁeld, then [E : F] = n and Gal(E/F) ∼= Z/(n).
Example 5.7.3. Let f(x) = xn −p ∈Q[x] where p is prime. (The essential point is not that p is
prime, but that it is not a proper power.) By Eisenstein’s criterion f(x) is irreducible over Q. If
we let r =
n√p denote the positive real nth root of p and ω = e2πi/n, a primitive nth root of unity,
then the factorization of f(x) in C[x] is
xn −p = (x −r)(x −ωr) . . . (x −ωn−1r).
Now let E = Q[r, ωr, . . . , ωn−1r] be a splitting ﬁeld for f(x), and let ϕ ∈Gal(E/Q). Then ϕ
permutes {r, ωr, . . . , wn−1r} and ϕ is completely deﬁned by its action on the set {r, ωr, . . . , ωn−1r}.
This gives rise to an embedding
Gal(E/Q) ֒→Sn = Sym{r, ωr, . . . , ωn−1r}.
Note that ω = (ωr)r−1, so ω ∈E. This makes it clear that
E = Q[r, ωr, . . . , ωn−1r] = Q[ω, r] = Q[ω][r].
Thus, E is generated over Q by two elements ω and r. We also know that E can be generated over
Q by a primitive element. However, using such an element would not simplify the description of
Gal(E/Q).

174
5. Field Theory
Now consider ϕ ∈Gal(E/Q). Then
ϕ(ω) = ωi
and
ϕ(r) = ωjr
for some 1 ≤i ≤n−1 such that gcd(i, n) = 1 and 0 ≤j ≤n−1. The choice of i and j completely
determines ϕ and it turns out that all of the above choices do determine automorphisms of E.
Thus,
|Gal(E/Q)| = n · φ(n).
To describe Gal(E/Q) more precisely, let Q[ω] = EH, and for 0 ≤j ≤n −1, let Q[ωjr] =
EKj.
Since Q[ω] is Galois over Q, H is normal in Gal(E/Q).
Moreover, by Theorem 5.7.7,
H = Gal(E/Q[ω]) = ⟨τ⟩∼= Z/(n) is cyclic of order n with generator τ deﬁned by
τ(ω) = ω
and
τ(r) = ωr.
The group Kj are more difﬁcult to describe explicitly, but they are all conjugate in Gal(E/Q)
and isomorphic as abstract groups to Gal(Q[ω]/Q) ∼= (Z/(n))×. We have the following diagram
of subgroups of Gal(E/Q) which does not include all subgroups.

As a group, Gal(E/Q) is a semi-direct product H ⋊Ki for any i.
We conclude this section with the statement of the following theorem on the Galois group of
splitting ﬁelds of irreducible separable polynomials xn −a without proof.
Theorem 5.7.8. Let F[ω] be a splitting ﬁeld for xn −1 over F where ω is a primitive nth root of
unity. Suppose that a ∈F and f(x) = xn −a is irreducible over F and let E be a splitting ﬁeld
for f(x) over F. Let d be the largest divisor of n such that bd = a for some b ∈F[ω] (possibly
d = 1). Let G = Gal(E/F) and H = Gal(E/F[ω]). Then H is cyclic of order d and normal in G,
Gal(F[ω]/F) ∼= G/H is isomorphic to a subgroup of (Z/(n))× and G is isomorphic to a semi-direct
product of H by G/H.
Using the cyclotomic polynomials, we now present the proof of Wedderburn’s theorem as
follows.
Theorem 5.7.9. [Wedderburn, 1909] A ﬁnite division ring is a ﬁeld.

5.7. Cyclotomic Extensions
175
Proof. Let D be a ﬁnite division ring. Then the center of D, denoted by F, is a ﬁnite ﬁeld (see
Exercises 2.1). Assume that |F| = q. Since D is a vector space over F, |D| = qn for some n ∈N.
Also, for an element d ∈D, the set C(d) = {r ∈D : rd = dr} is a division ring containing F
and |C(d)| = qm for some m ≤n, which is strictly less than if d /∈F. Thus, the class equation
(Corollary 1.3.8) for the multiplicative group D ∖{0} is
qn −1 = |F ∖{0}| +
s
X
i=1
[D ∖{0} : C(di) ∖{0}] = q −1 +
s
X
i=1
qn −1
qmi −1,
where d1, d2, . . . , ds represent the conjugacy classes of D ∖{0} which contains more than one
element and |C(di)| = qmi for some mi < n for all i. Because each (qn −1)/(qmi −1) = [D ∖{0} :
C(di) ∖{0}] is an integer, mi is a proper divisor of n. Thus, the quotient
xn −1
Φn(x)(xmi −1)
is a polynomial in Z[x]. Substitute q for x, we see that Φn(q) divides (qn −1)/(qmi −1). It follows
from the class equation that Φn(q) divides q −1 because it divides all the other terms. Then
|Φn(q)| ≤q −1. On the other hand, since 1 is the closest point, on the unit circle {z ∈C : |z| = 1},
to the positive integer q, we have that for every primitive nth root of unity ωj,
|q −ωj| ≥q −1 ≥1,
and the ﬁrst inequality is strict unless ωj = 1, that is, unless 1 is a primitive nth root of unity which
means n = 1. So the product |Φn(q)| of the |q−ωj|’s is greater than or equal to q−1, with equality
only if n = 1. Because |Φn(q)| is both at most q −1 and at least q −1, we get |Φn(q)| = q −1
and hence n = 1. Therefore, |D| = q = |C(D)|, so D = C(D) which implies D is commutative as
desired.
Given a ﬁeld F and a polynomial p(x) ∈F[x], we say that p(x) is solvable by radicals over F
if we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds F1 = F(ω1), F2 = F1(ω2), . . . , Fk = Fk−1(ωk) such that
ωr1
1 ∈F, ωr2
2 ∈F1, . . . , ωrk
k ∈Fk−1 and all roots of p(x) lie in Fk.
If K is the splitting ﬁeld of p(x) over F, then p(x) is solvable by radicals over F if we can ﬁnd
a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds as above such that K ⊆Fk. An important remark, and one we shall use
later, in the proof of Theorem 5.7.10, is that if such an Fk can be found, we can, without loss of
generality, assume it to be a normal extension of F. We leave its proof as an exercise.
Theorem 5.7.10. [Galois] Let F be a ﬁeld which contains a primitive nth root of unity for every
positive integer n. If a polynomial p(x) ∈F[x] is solvable by radical over F, then the Galois group
over F of p(x) is solvable.
Proof. Let K be the splitting ﬁeld of p(x) over F. Since p(x) is solvable by radicals, there exists a
ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds
F = F0 ⊂F1 = F(ω1) ⊂F2 = F1(ω2) ⊂. . . ⊂Fk = Fk−1(ωk),
where ωr1
1 ∈F, ωr2
2 ∈F1, . . . , ωrk
k ∈Fk−1 and K ⊆Fk such that Fk is normal over F. As a normal
extension of F, Fk is also a normal of any intermediate ﬁelds, hence Fk is a normal extension of
each Fi. Theorem 5.7.6 implies that Fi is a normal extension of Fi−1 and Gal(Fi/Fi−1) is abelian
for all i. Thus, by the Galois correspondence, Gal(Fk/Fi) is a normal subgroup in Gal(Fk/Fi−1).
Consider the normal series
Gal(Fk/F0) ⊃Gal(Fk/F1) ⊃Gal(Fk/F2) ⊃. . . ⊃Gal(Fk/Fk−1) ⊃{1}.
Since Gal(Fk/Fi−1)/Gal(Fk/Fi) ∼= Gal(Fi/Fi−1) is abelian for all i, Gal(Fk/F) is solvable. It
follows that Gal(K/F) ∼= Gal(Fk/F)/Gal(Fk/K) is solvable by Theorem 3.2.4 (2).

5. Field Theory
We make two remarks without proof.
1. The converse of Theorem 5.7.10 is also true; that is, if the Galois group of p(x) over F is
solvable, then p(x) is solvable by radicals over F.
2. Theorem 5.7.10 and its converse are true even if F does not contain roots of unity.
Recall that for n ≥5, Sn is not solvable. Thus we have
Corollary 5.7.11. The general polynomial of degree n ≥5 over Q is not solvable by radical.

(a) Prove that [E : F] is ﬁnite.
(b) If Gal(E/F) is abelian, show that K is normal over F.
5. If p(x) is solvable by radicals over F, prove that we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds

has a real root between 0 and 1 and between 1 and 2.
(b) Use Rolle’s theorem to assure that there is no other real roots. Hence, the other two roots of g(x) are
non real complex numbers, say a + bi and a −bi.
(c) Let K be the splitting ﬁeld of g(x) in C. Show that Gal(K/Q) is isomorphic to S5.

compute the Galois group of its splitting ﬁeld over Q and show that this group is solvable.
5.8
Normal Bases
Let E be an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F. We have known from Lemma 5.6.8 that the automorphism
in Gal(E/F) are E-linearly independent F-linear transformations.

Theorem 5.8.1. If E/F is a ﬁnite Galois extension with Galois group G = {1, σ2, . . . , σn}. Then

Proof. Call the above matrix M and suppose that det M = 0. Since M ∈Mn(E), there are
α1, α2, . . . , αn ∈E, not all zero, such that

M = ⃗0.
This translates to θ(u1) = θ(u2) = · · · = θ(un) = 0 where
θ = α11 + α2σ2 + · · · + αnσn : E →E.
But θ : E →E is a F-linear map, so θ is the zero map, since it vanishes on u1, u2, . . . , un.
Since 1, σ2, . . . , σn are linearly independent over K, Lemma 5.6.8 says that θ ̸= 0, so we have a
contradiction.
Conversely, if u1, u2, . . . , un are not a basis for E/F, then there are β1, β2, . . . , βn ∈F, not all
zero, such that
u1β1 + u2β2 + · · · + unβn = 0.
Then for any σi ∈G,
σi(u1)β1 + σi(u2)β2 + · · · + σi(un)βn = σi(u1β1 + u2β2 + · · · + unβn) = 0,

Note that if |K| = q, then αq −α = 0 for all α ∈K, so f(x) = xq −x is a nonzero polynomial
but it is a zero function. The next theorem says that such a polynomial cannot exist if K is inﬁnite.
Theorem 5.8.2. Let F be an inﬁnite ﬁeld and F ⊆E. If f(x1, . . . , xn) is a nonzero polynomial in
E[x1, . . . , xn], then there exist α1, . . . , αn ∈F such that f(α1, . . . , αn) ̸= 0.
Proof. We shall use induction on n. For n = 1, since f(x1) has only ﬁnitely many roots and F is
inﬁnite, there is αi ∈F such that f(α1) ̸= 0. Assume that the statement holds for n, and let

Since f ̸= 0, at least one of f0(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , ft(x1, . . . , xn) is nonzero, so there are α1, . . . , αn ∈
F such that f(α1, . . . , αn, xn+1) ̸= 0 in E[xn+1]. By the one variable case, there is αn+1 ∈F such
that f(α1, . . . , αn, αn+1) ̸= 0.
Theorem 5.8.3. Let F be an inﬁnite ﬁeld and E/F Galois with Galois group G = Gal(E/F) =
{1, σ2, . . . , σn}. Suppose that 0 ̸= f(x1, . . . , xn) ∈F[x1, . . . , xn] where x1, . . . , xn are indetermi-
nates over F. Then there exists u ∈E such that f(u, σ2(u), . . . , σn(u)) ̸= 0.

is invertible. This means that the map on E[x1, . . . , xn] deﬁned by
g(x1, . . . , xn) 7→g(u1x1 + · · · + unxn, . . . , σn(u1)x1 + · · · + σn(un)xn)
is an isomorphism. Thus,
h(x1, . . . , xn) = f(u1x1 + · · · + unxn, . . . , σn(u1)x1 + · · · + σn(un)xn)
is a nonzero polynomial in E[x1, . . . , xn]. By Theorem 5.8.2, there are a1, . . . , an in F such that
h(a1, . . . , an) ̸= 0. Let u = u1a1 + · · · + unan, this translates to
0 ̸= h(a1, . . . , an) = f(u1a1 + · · · + unan, . . . , σn(u1)a1 + · · · + σn(un)an)
= f(u, σ2(u), . . . , σn(u)),
since σi(u1)a1 + · · · + σi(un)an = σi(u1a1 + · · · + unan) = σi(u).
Consider E = Q[i] is a Galois extension over Q. Its Galois group is of order two and consists
of the identity map and the complex conjugation. A basis over Q for it is {1, i}. This basis is
not invariant under the Galois action, namely after acting by the complex conjugation, we obtain
{1, −i}. We are showing the existence of a basis for a ﬁnite Galois extension which forms a single
orbit under the action of the Galois group. For example, for Q[i], we may use {1 + i, 1 −i}. In the
case of ﬁnite ﬁelds, this means that each of the basis elements is related to any one of them by
applying the Frobenius’ automorphism repeatedly.
Let E/F be Galois with Galois group G = Gal(E/F) = {σ1, . . . , σn}. A normal basis for E/F
is a basis of the form {σ1(u), . . . , σn(u)} for some u ∈E. Eisenstein conjectured the existence
of a normal basis in 1850 for ﬁnite extensions of ﬁnite ﬁelds and Hensel gave a proof for ﬁnite
ﬁelds in 1888. Dedekind used such bases in number ﬁelds in his work on the discriminant in
1880, but he had no general proof. (See the quote by Dedekind on the bottom of page 51 of
Curtis’s “Pioneers of Representation Theory: Frobenius, Burnside, Schur, and Brauer”.) In 1932
Noether gave a proof for some inﬁnite ﬁelds while Deuring gave a uniform proof for all ﬁelds
(also in 1932). This basis is frequently used in cryptographic applications that are based on the
discrete logarithm problem such as elliptic curve cryptography. Hardware implementations of
normal basis arithmetic typically have far less power consumption than other bases.
Theorem 5.8.4. [Normal Basis Theorem] Let E/F be a Galois extension with Galois group G =
Gal(E/F) = {σ1, . . . , σn}. Then E/F has a normal basis.
Proof. We shall assume that F is inﬁnite and leave the ﬁnite case as an exercise (see Exercise 5.6).
Let u ∈E. By Theorem 5.8.1, {σ1(u), σ2(u), . . . , σn(u)} is a basis for E/F if and only if

Note that the entries in each row or column of the above matrix, call M, are a permutation of
the elements σ1(u), . . . , σn(u). In other words, each σi(u) occurs exactly once in each row and
column of M. Thus,
M = σ1(u)A1 + · · · + σn(u)An
where each Ai is a permutation matrix (a matrix with a single entry 1 in each row and column
and the remaining entries zero). Since det Ai = ±1, we see by inspection that if x1, . . . , xn are
indeterminates over E
f(x1, . . . , xn) = det(x1A1 + · · · + xnAn) = ±xn

In particular, f(x1, . . . , xn) is a nonzero polynomial in E[x]. By Theorem 5.8.3, there is a ¯u ∈E
such that f(σ1(¯u), . . . , σn(¯u)) ̸= 0. This translates to
0 ̸= f(σ1(¯u), . . . , σn(¯u)) = det(σ1(¯u)A1 + · · · + σn(¯u)An) = det M.
Hence, σ1(¯u), . . . , σn(¯u) is a desired normal basis for E/F.

Transcendental Extensions
Most of extension ﬁelds seen in the previous section are algebraic. In this section, we shall present
some results on transcendental extension. The ﬁnal theorem, namely Lüroth’s theorem, has many
applications in algebraic geometry and function ﬁeld theory.
Let F be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld E and let x1, x2, . . . be independent indeterminates over E. An el-
ement z ∈E is transcendental over F if the homomorphism F[x1] →E deﬁned by f(x1) 7→f(z)
is one-to-one. We call z ∈E algebraic over F if it is not transcendental over F. A ﬁnite set
{z1, . . . , zn} ⊂E is algebraically independent over F if the homomorphism F[x1, . . . , xn] →E
deﬁned by f(x1, . . . , xn) 7→f(z1, . . . , zn) is one-to-one. (Note that the empty set is algebraically
independent since F ֒→E is one-to-one.) An arbitrary subset Z of E is algebraically inde-
pendent over F if all of its ﬁnite subsets are algebraically independent. A subset Z of E is
algebraically dependent if it is not algebraically independent.
Remarks.
1. If z is transcendental over F, then F[z] ∼= F[x1], so F[z] is not a ﬁeld and F[z] is
inﬁnite dimensional over F.
2. If z is algebraic over F, then F[z] ∼= F[x1]/(f(x1)) where f(x1) is the minimal polynomial
of z over F. Thus, F[z] = F(z) is a ﬁeld and F[z] is ﬁnite dimensional over F.
Example 5.9.1. Let F ⊂F(y, z) ⊂E where y and z are independent indeterminates over F. Then
{y2, z2} is an algebraically independent set but {y2, yz, z2} is not (for, if f(x1, x2, x3) = x1x3 −x2
2,
then f(y2, yz, z2) = 0).
Let F be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld E. E is algebraic over F if each element of E is algebraic over F.
E is purely transcendental over F if it is isomorphic (by an isomorphism which is the identity
on F) to F({xα}) where {xα} is a (possibly inﬁnite) set of independent indeterminates.
Theorem 5.9.1. Let F be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld E.
1. There exists a subset X of E (possibly X is empty) such that
(a) X is algebraically independent over F.
(b) X is maximal among algebraically independent sets, in the sense: If X ⊆Y ⊆E and
X ̸= Y , then Y is not algebraically independent.
2. F(X) is purely transcendental over F and E is algebraic over F(X).

5. Field Theory
Proof. (1) Let S = {X ⊆E : X is algebraically independent}. Since the empty set is alge-
braically independent, S is nonempty. Let {Xα}α∈Λ be a chain in S . Let {z1, . . . , zn} ⊆S
α∈Λ Xα.
Then ∀i, ∃αi ∈Λ, zi ∈Xαi. Since {Xα}α∈Λ is a chain, we may rearrange αi so that there exists
j ∈Λ such that zi ∈Xαj for all i. Since Xαi is algebraically independent, so is {z1, . . . , zn}. Thus,
S
α∈Λ Xα is an upper bound of this chain in S . By Zorn’s Lemma, S has a maximal element, say
X. Hence, F(X) is purely transcendental over F. The maximality of X implies that E must be
algebraic over F.
(2) The deﬁnition of algebraically independent means that F(X) is purely transcendental over F.
Consider z ∈E. If z ∈X ⊂F(X), then z is algebraic over F(X). If z /∈X, the set X ∪{z} is alge-
braically dependent, so for some n there is a nonzero polynomial f(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) (x1, . . . , xn+1
are indeterminates over F) and a1, . . . , an ∈X such that f(a1, . . . , an, z) = 0. The polynomial
f(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) cannot be a polynomial in only x1, . . . , xn, since {a1, . . . , an} is an algebraically
independent set. Write
f(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) = f0(x1, . . . , xn) + f(x1, . . . , xn)xn+1 + · · · + fr(x1, . . . , xn)xr
n+1.
Thus, f(a1, . . . , an, xn+1) ∈F(X)[xn+1] is a nonzero polynomial having z as a root, so z is alge-
braic over F(X). Hence, E is algebraic over F(X).
Remark. There is no uniqueness for the ﬁeld F(X). For example, if E = F(t) where t is an
indeterminate, then we can take X = {p(t)/q(t)} where p(t)/q(t) is any element of E which
is not in F. In this case [E : F(p(t)/q(t))] = n where n = max{deg p(t), deg q(t)} (Theorem
5.9.3). However, we shall see shortly that the number of elements in the set X is independent of
particular set X.
Let F be a subﬁeld of E. A maximal algebraically independent (over F) subset of E is called
a transcendence basis for E/F.
Remark. By Theorem 5.9.1, a transcendence basis for E/F exists. It may be empty, which hap-
pens precisely when E is algebraic over F. Also, E is purely transcendental over F if it has a
transcendence base B such that E = F(B).
Theorem 5.9.2. Let F be a subﬁeld of E. Then any two transcendence bases for E/F have the
same cardinality.
We call the number of elements of transcendence bases of E the transcendence degree of
E/F. For example, an algebraic extension has transcendence degree zero; F(x) has transcen-
dence degree one over F; in general, F((xα)α∈Λ) has transcendence degree |Λ| over K.
The purely transcendental extension ﬁelds E/F, especially those having a ﬁnite transcendence
degree, appear to be the simplest type of extension ﬁelds. It is clear that such a ﬁeld is isomor-
phic to the ﬁeld of fractions F(x1, . . . , xn) of the polynomial ring F[x1, . . . , xn] in indeterminates
x1, . . . , xn. Even though these ﬁelds look quite innocent, there are difﬁcult and unsolved problems
particularly on the nature of the subﬁelds of F(x1, . . . , xn)/F. The one case where the situation
is quite simple is that in which E has transcendence degree one. We shall consider this case and
close this chapter.
Let E = F(t), t transcendental, and let u ∈E, /∈F. We can write u = f(t)/g(t) where
f(t), g(t) ∈F[t] and (f(t), g(t)) = 1. If n is the larger of the degrees of f(t) and g(t), then we can
write
f(t) = a0 + a1t + · · · + antn
and
g(t) = b0 + b1t + · · · + bntn,
ai, bi ∈F, and either an or bn ̸= 0. We have f(t) −ug(t) = 0, so
(an −ubn)tn + (an−1 −ubn−1)tn−1 + · · · + (a0 −ub0) = 0
(5.9.1)
and an −ubn ̸= 0 since either an ̸= 0 or bn ̸= 0 and u /∈F. Thus, (5.9.1) shows that t is algebraic
over F(u) and [F(t) : F(u)] ≤n. We prove the following more precise result.

5.9. Transcendental Extensions
181
Theorem 5.9.3. Let E = F(t), t transcendental over F, and let u ∈F(t), /∈F. Write u =
f(t)/g(t) where (f(t), g(t)) = 1, and let n = max{deg f(t), deg g(t)}. Then u is transcendental
over F, t is algebraic over F(u), and [F(t) : F(u)] = n. Moreover, the minimal polynomial of t
over F(u) is a multiple in F(u) of f(x, u) = f(x) −ug(x).
Proof. Put f(x, y) = f(x) −yg(x) ∈F[x, y], x, y indeterminates. This polynomial in x and y
is of ﬁrst degree in y and it has no factor h(x) of positive degree since (f(x), g(x)) = 1. Thus,
it is irreducible in F[x, y]. Now t is algebraic over F(u) so if u were algebraic over F, then
t would be algebraic over F, contrary to the hypothesis. Hence, u is transcendental over F.
Then F[x, u] ∼= F[x, y] under the isomorphism over F ﬁxing x and mapping u into y and hence
f(x, u) is irreducible in F[x, u]. It turns out that f(x, u) is irreducible in F(u)[x]. Since f(t, u) =
f(t) −ug(t) = 0, it follows that f(x, u) is a multiple in F(u)[x] of the minimal polynomial of t
over F(u). Therefore, [F(t) : F(u)] is the degree in x of f(x, u). This degree is n, so the proof is
complete.
We can determine all of the subﬁelds E/F for E = F(t), t transcendental: These have the
form F(u) for some u. This important result is called the Lüroth’s Theorem. Lüroth proved it in
case K = C in 1876. It was ﬁrst proved for general ﬁelds K by Steinitz in 1910, by the following
argument.
Theorem 5.9.4. [Lüroth] If E = F(t), t transcendental over F, then any subﬁeld K of E/F,
K ̸= F, has the form F(u), u transcendental over F.
Proof. Let v ∈K, /∈F. Then we have seen that t is algebraic over F(v). Thus, t is algebraic
over K. Let f(x) = xn + k1xn−1 + · · · + kn be the minimal polynomial of t over K, so the
ki ∈K and n = [F(t) : K]. Since t is not algebraic over F, some kj /∈F. We shall show
that K = F(u), u = kj. We can write u = g(t)/h(t) where g(t), h(t) ∈F[t], (g(t), h(t)) = 1 and
m = max{deg g(t), deg h(t)} > 0. Then, by Theorem 5.9.3, [E : F(u)] = m. Since K ⊃F(u) and
[E : K] = n, we evidently have m ≥n and equality holds if and only if K = F(u). Now t is a root
of the polynomial g(x) −uh(x) ∈K[x]. Hence, we have a q(x) ∈K[x] such that
g(x) −uh(x) = q(x)f(x).
(5.9.2)
The coefﬁcient ki of f(x) is in F(t), so there exists a nonzero polynomial c0(t) of least degree such
that c0(t)ki = ci(t) ∈F[t] for 1 ≤i ≤n. Then c0(t)f(x) = f(x, t) = c0(t)xn + c1(t)xn−1 + · · · +
cn(t) ∈F[x, t], and f(x, t) is primitive as a polynomial in x, that is, the ci(t) are relatively prime.
The x-degree of f(x, t) is n. Since kj = g(t)/h(t) with (g(t), h(t)) = 1, the t-degree of f(x, t) is
≥m. Now replace u in (5.9.2) by g(t)/h(t) and the coefﬁcients of q(x) by their expressions in t.
There exist, therefore, ϕ(t) and q(x, t) ∈F[x, t] such that
ϕ(t)[g(x)h(t) −g(t)h(x)] = f(x, t)q(x, t).
Since the coefﬁcients c0(t), c1(t), . . . , cn(t) of f(x, t) have no common factor, we know that ϕ(t)
divides q(x, t). Hence, we may assume ϕ(t) = 1. It turns out that there exists a polynomial
q′(x, t) ∈F[x, t] such that
g(x)h(t) −g(t)h(x) = f(x, t)q′(x, t).
Since the t-degree of the left-hand side is ≤m and that of f(x, t) is ≥m, it follows that this
degree is m and q′(x, t) = q′(x) ∈F[x]. Then the right-hand side is primitive as a polynomial in x
and so is the left-hand side. By symmetry the left-hand side is primitive as a polynomial in t also.
Hence, q′(x) = q′ ∈F. Thus, f(x, t) has the same x-degree and t-degree so m = n, which implies
that K = F(u).

Exercises 5.9.
1. Prove that there is no intermediate ﬁeld K with Q ⊆K ⫋C with C purely transcen-
dental over K.
2. Prove that a purely transcendental proper extension of a ﬁeld is never algebraically closed.
3. Let E = F(t, v), where t is transcendental over F and v2 + t2 = 1. Show that E is purely transcen-
dental over F.
Project 27 (More on Lüroth’s theorem). Prove more general fact that if F ⊆L ⊆E and E is ﬁnitely
generated over F (ﬁnite transcendence degree), then L is also ﬁnitely generated over F. We can ask more
generally about minimal numbers of generators of ﬁnitely-generated extensions. For instance, suppose
K ⊊L ⊆K(x1, . . . , xn) where the xi are algebraically independent over K. If L/K has transcendence
degree 1, then L = K(α), This was proved for K = C by Gordan in 1887, and for arbitrary K by Igusa
in 1951. If C ⊊L ⊆C(x1, . . . , xn) where L/C has transcendence degree 2, then L = C(α, β). This was
proved by Castelnuovo in 1894. All known proofs are difﬁcult. The result is not true in general for other
types of ﬁelds K, such as Q or R. Finally, there are ﬁelds L with C ⊊L ⊊C(x1, x2, x3) such that L/C has
transcendence degree 3 but cannot be generated by three elements.
