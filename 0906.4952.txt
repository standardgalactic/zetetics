Abstract:  
Processes undergoing quantum mechanics, exhibit quantum interference effects. In this case  
quantum probabilities result to be different from classical probabilities because they contain an 
additional main point that in fact is called the quantum interference term. We use ambiguous figures 
to analyse if during perception cognition of human subjects we have violation of the classical 
probability field and quantum interference. The experiments, conducted on a group of  256 subjects, 
evidence that we have such quantum effect. Therefore, mental states, during perception cognition of 
ambiguous figures, follow quantum mechanics.

Introduction 
Mental operations  consists of a content plus the awareness of such content. Consciousness is a 
system which observes itself. It evaluates itself being aware at the same time of doing so. We may 
indicate awareness statements by a, b, c, … that are self-referential or auto referential  and content 
statements of our experience by  x , y, z, … . a=F(a, x) is the most simple definition of a single 
autoreferential statement. For example, x= the snow is white; a=I am aware of this. Human 
experience unceasingly involves intrinsically mental and experiential functions such as “knowing” 
and “feeling”, involving images, intentions, thoughts and beliefs. A continuous interface holds 
between mind/consciousness and brain. Neuroscience and neuro-psychology have reached  high 
levels of understanding and knowledge in this field by the extended utilization of 
electrophysiological and of functional brain imaging technology. First of all this last technique has 
identified brain areas that are involved in a wide variety of brain functions including learning and 
memory. These are valuable studies that provide knowledge of the functional role of different brain 
areas. However neuroscience finds  it hard to identify the crucial link existing between empirical 
studies that are currently described in psychological terms and the data that arise instead  described 
in neurophysiological terms. It is assumed that the measurable properties of the brain through 
functional imaging technology should be in itself sufficient to achieve an adequate explanation of 
the psychologically described phenomenology that occurs during neuropsychological experiments. 
Of course, this manner of investigation encounters the reservation of some investigators who 
suggest that intrinsically mental and experiential functions such as “feeling” and “ knowing” cannot 
be described exclusively in terms of material structure, and they require an adequate physics in 
order to be actually explained. To this purpose they outline the important role that quantum 
mechanics could carry out. In particular, we outline here the effort of Stapp in several years and 
more recently (Schwartz, Stapp, Beauregard, 2005), who repeatedly outlined the problem to 
consider quantum mechanics in Neuroscience and Neuropsychology. The prospects for a quantum 

 
4
neurobiology were also outlined already more than a past decade ago (Miller 1996). Therefore,  it 
becomes of fundamental and general interest for neuroscience and neuro-psychology to ascertain by 
experiments if quantum mechanics has a role in brain dynamics. In the present paper we present an 
important contribution concerning this basic problem. We demonstrate that mental states follow 
quantum mechanics during perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. 
 
Quantum theoretical approach 
Previously we have given  a logical self-reference mathematical model of conscious experience that 
is due to A.G. Kromov (Khromov 2001). Consciousness represents the hard problem for scientific, 
epistemological and philosophical knowledge (Whitehead 1929; Whitehead 1933; Shimony 1997; 
Stapp 1933).  Present physical theory does not define an apparatus to describe conscious systems. 
However,  we cannot  exclude that future generalizations of the present physical knowledge will be 
able to approach such basic problem. An indication  arises from quantum mechanics. Quantum 
theory represents the most confirmed and celebrated theory of science. Started in 1927 by founder 
fathers as Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Pauli, it has revolutionized our understanding of the 
physical reality in both scientific and epistemological fields. It was introduced to describe the 
behaviour of atomic systems but subsequently its range of validity has turned out to be much wider 
including in particular some macroscopic phenomena like superconductivity or superfluidity. There 
is a salient and crucial feature for this theory. The conceptual structure and the axiomatic 
foundations of quantum theory  repeatedly suggested from its advent and in the further eighty years 
of its elaboration that it has a profound link with mental entities and their dynamics. From its advent 
such theory was strongly debated but often also criticized  just for its attitude to prospect a model of 
reality that results strongly linked to mental entities and their dynamics. The standard formulation 
of quantum mechanics seems to fix  the necessity for to admitting the unequivocal role of mental 
properties to represent properties of the physical objects. We retain that it represents an important 
feature of the theory instead of its limit. However, there is the problem to correctly interpreting the 

 
5
connection between quantum mechanics and mental properties in the sphere of reality. It must be 
clear that one cannot have in mind a quantum physical reduction of mental processes. N. Bohr 
(Bohr 1987) borrowed the principle of complementarity, which is at the basis of quantum 
mechanics, from psychology. He was profoundly influenced from reading the “Principles of 
Psychology “ by W. James (James 1890).  However, N. Bohr never had in mind quantum-
reductionism of mental entities. Starting with 1930, there was also an important correspondence 
between W. Pauli and C.G. Jung that culminated in the formulation of a theory of mind-matter 
synchronization (Meier 2001). Also  in this case these founding fathers as Pauli and Jung were very 
distant to consider a quantum-reductionism perspective. V. Orlov (Orlov 1982) proposed a quantum 
logic to describe brain function but also he did not look for reduction of mental processes to 
quantum physics. The correct way to frame the problem is not to attempt a quantum reduction of 
mental processes. The most profitable applications of quantum mechanics in cognitive sciences and 
psychology can be obtained not by any attempt of quantum physical reduction but  giving 
experimental evidence that cognitive systems are  very complex information systems, to which also 
some laws of quantum systems can be applied. Just the reaching of such objective would represent a 
very great advance in the domain of knowledge. In fact, starting with such experimental evidence, 
we could elaborate some future developments knowing this time the principles to use, the  formal 
criteria to follow in order to approach with higher  rigour the framing of the nature of mental 
entities and of their dynamics. 
We retain that in this perspective we obtain here a first contribution since we give  for the first time 
experimental confirmation that mental states, at some stages of human perception and cognition, 
can be described by the formalism of quantum mechanics. Thus for the first time, also if not under a 
reductionism perspective, we have the chance to understand what are the principles and rules acting 
as counter part of human mind. To fully agree with the present paper, the reader must take care the 
following crucial point: quantum mechanics has its unique law of transformation of probability 
distribution. It is well known that the main feature of quantum probabilistic behaviour is the well 

 
6
known phenomenon of  interference of probabilities. Such interference regime may be obtained 
only in quantum systems, e. g., in the celebrated  two slit experiment that has been confirmed at any 
level of experimental investigation (Feynman and Hibbs 1965; Zelinger 1966; Ballentine 1970). 
Quantum dynamics of human decision making was also studied rather recently by Busemeyer et al. 
(Busemeyer et al 2006). The interference gives the experimental basis of the superposition principle 
and this latter is the basis foundation of the physical and philosophical system of view that we call 
quantum mechanics. This is the essential peculiarity that we aim to investigate in the present paper. 
Recently, the problem of quantum probabilities was extended  to the so called calculus of contextual 
probabilities (Khrennikov 2001-2006). The basic notion of this approach is the context. In quantum 
mechanics it is a complex of experimental physical conditions. In the present paper it will be a complex of 
mental conditions. The essential feature of this elaboration is that by it we may be able to ascertain 
the presence of quantum like behaviour also in systems that exhibit context quantum like behaviour 
as physical, cognitive, social systems. We will not enter in the detail of the method here for brevity 
but all the features are given in the quoted literature (Khrennikov 2001-2006). The essence of the 
method is based on the following step. Let A and B be  two dichotomous questions which can be 
asked of people, S, with possible answers “yes (+) or not (-)”. In our case  we consider A and B two  
mental quantum like observables of  people S under investigation. We split the given ensemble S of 
humans into two sub ensembles U and V of equal numbers. To ensemble U we pose the question A 
with probability in answering, given respectively by

It plays a fundamental role in classical statistics and decision making. However, it is violated for 
statistical experiments with quantum systems. The two slit (interference) experiment is the basic 
experiment violating FTP. In physical literature such a  viewpoint on this experiment  was presented 
in detail by Feynman (Feynman, Hibbs 1965). By itself the appearance of interference fringes was 
not surprising for him: in principle, interaction with a screen with slits may produce any kind of  
distribution of points on the registration screen. Quantum  probabilistic features  appear if one 
consider three different experiments: a) only the first slit open (in an equivalent manner we consider 
here the case  B=+1), b) only the second slit is open (we consider in this case  B= -1), c) both slits 
are open.  Here the random variable B determines the slit. We now choose any point at the 
registration screen. The random variable A is A= +1 if a particle hits the screen at this point and 
A=-1 in the opposite case.  For classical particles, FTP should predict the probability

which are provided by the a and b- experiments. But, as was already mentioned, FTP is violated for 
quantum particles: an additional cosine-type term appears in the right-hand side of FTP. This is 
nothing else than the quantum  interference of probabilities. Feynman characterized this feature of 
the two slit experiment  as the most profound violation of laws of classical probability theory. Our 
aim is to show that this fundamental law of classical probability can be violated even by cognitive 
systems. Opposite to quantum mechanics, we could not start directly with the Hilbert space 
formalism. In quantum mechanics this formalism was justified by experiments. It was not yet done 
in cognitive science and psychology. Here we have to start directly with experimental data , and  we 
calculate the quantity representing deviation from the classical probabilistic law (Khrennikov 2001-
2006). It represents quantum interference  and it is given in the following terms:

We recall that the conventional quantum formalism implies that in general λ  is not equal to zero 
(opposite to classical statistics).  If in the experiment for cognitive systems with questions A and B  
results 
0
≠
λ
it will be certain that we are in presence of quantum like behaviour for mental states 
owing to the presence of interference terms for the calculated probabilities. In the case λ =0  we 
will conclude that quantum like behaviour is absent  in the dynamic regime of our mental states. We 
also recall that in quantum mechanics  the coefficient λ  can be represented  as  λ =
ϑ
cos
, where ϑ  
is obviously a well known angle of phase. We may expect a similar result for cognitive systems. In 
conclusion, the  interference coefficient, introduced in the (2.1), gives a measure of incompatibility of 
different contexts. 
  
We may also proceed giving a quantum like framework of mental states. Let us remember that, 
according to Born’s probability rule (Bohr 1987; Khrennikov 2001-2006), we have

It is   necessary to outline here  the importance of future studies on cognition based possibly on the 
(2.3). To this purpose, we would add something of more specific in relation to the meaning of the 
wave function given in the (2.3). The image recognition  could be  characterized by synchronization  
of firings in a neural network responsible for image recognition. Such a  synchronization may be 
conceived as a stabilization to a fixed frequency of firings, and thus  can be considered as a version 
of the collapse of the wave function. In substance, before synchronization-collapse, the  quantum 
like state of the particular neural network that we are considering, is still characterized by 

 
9
superposition of frequencies of neural firing. Actually,  it may be interpreted as superposition of 
alternatives.  
In our case these alternatives are two ambiguous sub-pictures, say A(+) and A(-),  in a given A-
figure. The quantum like state of the neural network working with image recognition is in the 
superposition of two states, say

Arrangement of the Experiment      
The experiment was based on the search of quantum behaviour in mental states during human 
perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. We used ambiguous figures in this paper not to 
analyse the field of the optical illusions but to consider the perceptual-cognitive system in a  simple 
model but  in the perspective of possible analysis in future  of more complex conditions of 
perception and cognition. 
In general, it is known that the brain organizes sensory input into some representation of a given 
environment. Studies of perception indicate that the mental representation of a visually perceived 
object at any instant is unique even if we may be aware of the possible ambiguity of any given 
representation. The well known example is the Necker cube (Necker 1832) where we see the cube 
in one of two ways and only one of such representations is apparent at any time. Therefore the basic 
key of the experiment that recalls  a quantum possible behaviour, is in the following statements.  
We may be  able to see the ambiguity of the design and even we may be able to switch wilfully 
between representations: we can be aware that multiple representations are possible but we can 
perceive them only one at time, that is  serially. Let us see the quantum like model that arises from 
this statement. 
Bistable perception is induced  whenever a stimulus can be thought in two different alternatives 
ways. Previously (Conte et al. 2003; Conte et al. 2007), we proposed to describe bistable perception 

 
10
with the formalism of a two quantum system. In our quantum like model of mental states we 
consider that an individual can potentially have multiple representations of a given choice situation, 
but can attend to only one representation at any given time. In this  quantum mechanical framework 
we distinguish a potential and an actual or manifest state of consciousness. The state of the potential 
consciousness will be represented by a vector  in Hilbert space. If we indicate for example a bi 
dimensional  case with  potential states  
>
1
 and  
>
2
,  the potential state of consciousness will be 
given by their superposition

Here, a  and b  represent probability amplitudes so that

consciousness, represented by percept

perception. Conversely

of consciousness 
will be actualised or manifested during perception. It will be

In a quantum mechanical model of consciousness, as outlined from various authors and in particular 
by Manousakis (Manoussakis 2006; Atmanspacker et al. 2004), we admit that, when a conscious 
observation happens, the actual perceptual event that in correspondence is realized in 
consciousness, is linked to a particular neural correlate brain state. In this  manner, in the (3.1),

and

represent two possible states having two distinct neural correlate of consciousness in brain 
states. 
For brevity we will not consider here the case of the evolution in time of the state of potential 
consciousness. 
In conclusion, according also to Eccles and Beck (Beck, Eccles 1992), the  mind is a field of 
probability. Quantum mechanics seems to relate tightly our  mental entities. The (3.1) ,given by the 
superposition principle,  links the condition of doubt , or of inner conflict , or still of inner 

 
11
indetermination  and uncertainty  that we may have in front of a novel question posed to our 
perception and cognition. 
 
Experiment Set Up. 
Images that can be perceived in at least two mutually exclusive manners, define what we call a 
multistable perception. In it the physical input to the retina remains constant but perceptual 
interpretations of the ambiguous image alternate between the percept possibilities. Generally 
speaking, the problem is to explain how, given multiple possibilities of representation, a particular 
representation can take  place over our attention. In the case of Necker cube transitions between 
percepts, it  may be  possibly stochastic,  but in more complex mental and psychological situations 
some underlying factors may give the edge to one representation over another. Recent or repeated 
prior use of a representation may play role in advantaging one representation over the other. This is 
the reason to project the experiment carefully. Otherwise, the study of ambiguous figures has 
intrigued and still is of  valuable interest for psychologists  and neuroscientists. A variety of theories 
has been published (Kohler 1940; Gibson, 1950; Atteneve 1971; Turvey, 1977; Toppino, Long 
1987;  Horlitz, O’Leary 1993; Mitroff et al. 2005). For brevity, we will mention here the so called 
“low level” and “high level” approaches. The first evidences that reversals are due to adaptation to 
feedforward mechanisms, the second instead supports that reversals arise in a feedback way on 
lower level sensory mechanisms. For the purposes of our experimentation we evaluated that two 
types of observers exist : 1) fast observers,  having larger frequency of perspective reversals and 2) 
slow observers whose frequency is lower. The time of staying one of the two percepts are on 
average on the order of two seconds, but may also approach about five seconds. To further confirm 
our quantum model with potential and actual states of consciousness, we have a further 
phenomenological datum. Subjects demonstrate uncertain time in percept states in addition to 
perspective reversal. Uncertain times about 1 sec were experimentally ascertained on average for  
fast subjects (Sakai et al. 1993; Sakai et al. 1994). In conclusion,  two kinds of times are identified  

 
12
during experiments with ambiguous figures: a time persisting one of the two possible percepts that 
may be called the  time persisting for percept, and  a time of uncertainty for which neither of the 
percepts is certain for the subject, and it  mirrors the previous quantum model on potential state of 
consciousness. There are still two basic different approaches in studies of perception of ambiguous 
stimuli. One is the behavioural response to a stimulus based on psychological  or mental processes. 
This is usually investigated using the frequency of reversals. The second approach looks instead to 
neural correlates of psychological processes triggered by stimuli. Neurophysiological and 
neuropsychological investigations have started to identify the physiology of such percept reversals. 
Recent fMRI studies have suggested that conscious detection of visual changes relies on both 
parietal and frontal areas (Kleinschmidt et al. 1998; Inui et al. 2000). These areas, therefore, seem to 
play an important role in detecting changes in our perception, whether they are caused externally or 
internally. Electrophysiological studies have been developed evaluating changes in neuronal 
activity related to perceptual reversals. In particular, ERP studies identified a P300-like component 
related to perceptual reversals (Struber et al. 2000; Struber, Herrmann. 2002; Pitts et al. 2007).  
 
Methods 
Our experiment was based on the analysis of (2.1) with ambiguous figures A and B. Previously, we 
performed four  experiments  of this kind based on ninety eights subjects (Conte et al. 2003; Conte 
et al. 2007). We outline here that also maintaining the same methodology of the previous paper,  we 
performed a completely new experimentation. We analysed a group of 72  subjects giving 
geometrical figures as Test A and Test B, respectively. See Figures 1 here attached. Still, we 
analysed a group of 52  subjects giving this time ambiguous figures of animals  as Test A and Test 
B respectively, (see still figures 2 for the test) We performed the third experiment with 64  subjects 
exchanging this time Test A with Test B. Finally we developed a final experiment based on 
ambiguous figures and Stroop effect with sixty 68 subjects,  using this time  ambiguous figures of 
animals but able to induce a possible semantic conflict (see Figure3). We retain that in this manner 

 
13
we experienced very different conditions in brain neural correlates. Specific neural pathways were 
engaged in perception of ambiguous geometrical figures respect to ambiguous forms of animals 
and, finally, ambiguous  forms of animals with added an inner semantic  conflict of subjects under 
Stroop effect. 
In conclusion, we used different tests of ambiguous percepts. A total of 256 subjects was involved. 
According to our quantum model  as  given in (2.1), we admitted that an individual can potentially 
have multiple representations of a given choice situation, but he can attend to only one 
representation at any given time. Strong and immediate ambiguity as induced in the present cases 
by tests  A and B, would consequently induce the subject to suspend his potential consciousness 
state to be  followed from an actualised or manifest state of his consciousness. All the subjects were 
selected with about equal distribution of females and males, aged between 19 and 22 years. All had 
normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All they were divided by random selection into two groups 
(1) and (2). Group (1) was subjected to test A, while the group (2) was subjected to Test B  and 
soon after (about 800 msec after choice for test B) to test A. In all the cases, to avoid the risk to 
influence the subjects, the question to be asked by tests was posed in the most neutral form.  
Each subject was asked to select A=+ or A=- (respectively B=+ or B=-) on the basis of what he was 
thinking about the figure at the instant of observation.. 
Finally,  It has been shown that perception and cognition in ambiguous figures is influenced by 
visual 
angle 
(Borsellino 
et 
al. 
1982). 
Therefore

 was used with S object’s frontal linear size and D  distance from 
the center of the eyes for all the subjects. Each observer was seated at a table with a monitor and 
computer, was told to look binocularly at the figure, with no fixation point provided, and with 
random reversals. The observer was requested to stop by pressing a key at the computer when he 
was aware of having thought of one percept . For each subject we ascertained, after his answer, that 
he had direct verification of the existing ambiguity in the figure before of his answering. The 
ambiguous figures were placed in front of the eyes of the observer at a distance of 60 cm, and 

 
14
illuminated by a lamp of 60 W located above and behind the observer’s head. The experimental 
room was kept under daylight illumination. The constant visual angle was realized for each subject 
using an S object’s frontal linear size of about 26 cm for the figure on the monitor. 
We also performed a statistical analysis of the results. As previously said, we examined  perception-
cognition during observation  of an ambiguous figure using Tests A and B and thus having  two 
variables that in our approach represent two dichotomous quantum observables A= ±  and B= ± . 
Quantum observables A and B that attend to the case of geometrical figures cannot be confused 
with quantum observables that attend to the case of forms of ambiguous animals or to the case of 
Stroop effect owing to the different neural correlates that each time are involved. Therefore, it 
resulted appropriate to use a non-parametric test as chi-square, analysing  each time singly the 
results of the experiment under consideration. In brief, for each experiment we  evaluated by chi-
square rejection or not of the null- hypothesis H0. Probabilities obtained by Test A were considered 
as to probabilities  obtained  by Test A/B.

and of mental wave functions whose meaning was discussed in the 
previous sections. Consequently, we have a strong evidence  that mental states follow quantum 
mechanics during perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. Using  tests, A and B, of Figures 
1, 2 and 3, utilizing accurate procedures of experimentation and statistics, we reach a robust 
conclusion on this subject. On the basis of the (3.1) we confirm, as just said, that mental states 
follow quantum mechanics during perception and cognitive performance of human brain for 
ambiguous percepts and cognition. We also find  that quantum interference is evidenced when we 
use tests based on Stroop effect. This is to say, when a semantic conflict is induced during 

 
15
perception. This represents a further strong indication on the possible quantum like behaviour of our 
mind.  
 
Discussion 
The results of the present paper establish that we have quantum like interference during perception 
and cognition in humans of ambiguous figures and also in the condition of semantic conflict. The 
presence of quantum like interference, indicates that quantum mechanics has a role in  the dynamics 
of mental states. Cognitive systems are fundamentally quantum like and the quantum representation 
might serve as the basis for quantum decision making by such cognitive systems. 
In detail, our perception-cognitive experiment evidenced  that cognitive systems can behave in the 
quantum like way  producing  nonzero coefficients of interference. The  contexts (corresponding to  
ambiguity figures) used in this cognitive experiment produced the coefficients of interference that 
provided a numerical measure of the  incompatibility of these contexts. In brief, the experiments 
outlined  deviations of cognitive statistics from classical statistics demonstrated as in classical and 
quantum wave mechanics.  
As consequence,  a cognitive system represents a mental context,  underlying decision making by a 
mental wave function, probabilistic  amplitude  as given in the (2.2) and the (2.3) and explicitly in 
Table1. Thus, instead of operating with probabilities and analysing (even unconsciously) 
probabilities of various alternatives, the brain works directly with mental wave functions 
(probabilistic amplitudes).  We conclude  that at least some perceptive- cognitive systems have such 
quantum-like abilities. The  brain should result to emulate quantum dynamics at least under some 
conditions. Such an emulation of quantum dynamics would allow for a three-valued logic in human 
cognition: true, false and the superposition of true and false. This could explain the peculiar 
human ability to hold contradictory notions in mind simultaneously, although usually there is 
collapse to one state or the other. But this ability to see things  from "opposite" views might have 
been valuable in the development of sociability, empathy and even cognitive innovation which 

 
16
seems to depend on seeing things in a radically different way as compared to social or cultural 
norms.
