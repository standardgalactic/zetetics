General relativity, thermodynamics, 
and the Poincare cycle 
Frank J. Tipler 
Department of Mathematics, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720 
An arbitrarily close return to a previous initial state of the 
Universe, such as predicted by the Poincare recurrence 
theorem, cannot occur in a closed universe governed by 
general relativity. The significance of this result for 
cosmology and thermodynamics is discussed. 
THE idea that history repeats itself-that every state of the 
Universe has occurred before and will occur again ad 
infinitum-is a concept which originated thousands of years ago 
and in the form of the Poincare cycle and the 'cyclic' universe, 
still plays an important part in fundamental physics. This notion 
of an 'eternal return' will be considered here in the context of 
general relativity, and it will be shown that in a closed universe, 
no arbitrarily close (or exact) return to a previous state of the 
universe is possible, provided certain very general restrictions 
on the matter tensor and global causal structure hold. This result 
is in stark contrast to the situation in classical mechanics: 
Poincare showed
1
·2 that for almost all initial states, any 
mechanical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom, 
finite total and kinetic energy, and constrained to move within a 
finite box must return arbitrarily closely and infinitely often to 
almost every previous state of the system. The reason for 'no 
return' in general relativity and 'eternal return' in classical 
mechanics is that in general relativity, singularities intervene to 
prevent recurrence. General-relativistic closed universes are 
thought to begin and end in singularities of infinite curvature, 
0028--0836/79/290203---03 $01.00 
and these singularities force time in general relativity to be linear 
rather than cyclic. 
Poincare recurrence has been reported2-5 to be a major 
stumbling block in the definition of entropy, a function of the 
state of the system which never decreases, in terms of the 
fundamental microscopic variables of the system. Hitherto the 
increase of an 'entropy' defined by such variables has been 
obtained (not very successfully) by such tricks as 'coarse-grain-
ing'2·6; an ad hoc addition of randomness to the system in the 
form of a postulate of 'molecular chaos' or 'random phases'2·
3
; 
or by taking the thermodynamic limit7·
8
• The thermodynamic 
limit, which involves letting the volume of the system and the 
number of particles it contains go to infinity, is particularly 
unphysical as the infinite volume limit places one in the realm of 
cosmology, yet the limit ignores the most important cosmologi-
cal force, gravity. The results of this paper may make such 
processes unnecessary, and there may be a strong connection 
between the increase of gravitational field entropy, which does 
not seem to require the above tricks, and the increase of matter 
entropy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the 
significance of the no-return theorem for cosmology. 
To prove that no two states of the Universe can be identical or 
even arbitrarily close, we must first define the notion of 'close'. 
This can be done by regarding the set of all initial data as a 
Sobolev space W'. The global topology of the space-time (M, g) 
is S x R, where S is compact, if the space-time is globally 
hyperbolic. We choose some positive definite metric e.b on M,

where du is the volume element induced on S by eab, DP is the 
generalised pth covariant derivative with respect to some chosen 
background metric g.b, and single verticle lines denote is the 
norm induced by eab (see ref. 9, p 233-235 for more details). 
Two tensors will be 'close' if they are 'close' in the norm of 
equation (1). 
Assumptions in the no-retum theorem 
The no-return theorem will require four conditions on the 
matter tensor. The first condition, the time-like convergence 
condition (ref. 9, p 95), says roughly that gravitation is always an 
attractive force. The other three conditions, are here called (a), 
(b) and (c) (for precise definition see ref. 9, p 254-255). Briefly, 
(a) says that the development from a given set of initial data is 
locally unique; (b) says that this unique development is locally 
stable; and (c) says that the stress-energy tensor is a polynomial 
in the matter fields, their first derivatives, and the space-time 
metric. As discussed by Hawking and Ellis (ref. 9, p 255), these 
are physically reasonable conditions to impose on the matter 
fields, though strictly speaking they are not necessary condi-
tions. Any other conditions which imply global Cauchy stability 
and uniqueness (as defined in ref. 9 Ch. 7) would be sufficient to 
prove the theorem below. 
We also need two global conditions. The first, the requirement 
of unique development from Cauchy surfaces (ref. 9, p 205), 
says that laplacian determinism holds for the space-time. The 
second, the generic condition (ref. 9, p 101) says that every 
causal geodesic experiences a tidal force at least once in its 
history. As this would be expected to be false only for a 
'measure-zero' set of solutions to the Einstein equations, the 
generic condition in the theorem below is analogous to the 
'measure-zero' qualifications in the Poincare recurrence 
theorem. A closed universe is defined to be a space-time in 
which the Cauchy surfaces are compact. A space-time that 
contains two disjoint space-like Cauchy surfaces which are 
isometric in their initial data is said to be time periodic. (Because 
if the evolution equations are well-posed, the development of 
the second Cauchy surface will be identical to that of the first, 
leading to a third identical surface, and so on.) 
No-retum theorem 
Theorem: If a space-time (M, g) containing compact Cauchy 
surfaces is uniquely developed from initial data on any of its 
Cauchy surfaces, and if (M, g) also satisfies both the generic and 
the time-like convergence conditions, then the space-time 
cannot be time periodic. Furthermore, if the matter fields ,/J and 
their first derivatives ,/J' also satisfy conditions (a), (b) and (c), 
then for any neighbourhood U of any Cauchy surface S1, a 
number 
e > 0 
exists 
such 
that 
li(h, x, t/1, t/1') -
(hi, Xi, t/11, t/1\ )lla+s > e for the initial data on any Cauchy surface 
S with Un S empty. (e Depends on e.b, g.b and U. The Cauchy 
surfaces S and S1 are assumed space-like.) 
The proof of this theorem will be published elsewhere. Note 
that the compactness of the Cauchy surfaces-the requirement 
of a closed universe-is an essential condition. If the word 
'compact' is removed, then the theorem is false; it does not apply 
to open universes. For example, a static stop in asymptotically 
flat space satisfies all the conditions of the theorem except 
compactness, and this spacetime can be foliated by Cauchy 
hypersurfaces normal to the timelike killing vector field. The 
initial data is the same on each of these hypersurfaces. 
Significance of no-return theorem 
One might think that any field theory in euclidean space would 
have a non-recurrent property similar to the one demonstrated 
above, as a continuous field has an infinite number of degrees of 
Nature Vol. 280 19 July 1979 
freedom. From a physical point of view, this is not the case. It is 
not possible to make a precise measurement of the field vari-
ables at every point, and, in practice, a field restricted to a finite 
region S would be approximated by dividing up S into a finite 
number of subregions, and the field in each subregion replaced 
by its average value in that subregion. Evolution would be via 
the differential field equations, but one would compare the 
'average' values. 
Comparing initial data sets via the Sobolev norm is analogous 
to comparing the average values of the field variables (and their 
derivatives) at one time with the average values at another time. 
With the Sobolev norm, one essentially takes the absolute 
square average value of the initial data over the entire Cauchy 
surface rather than dividing up the Cauchy surface into subre-
gions; the Sobolev average is a coarser average. The arbitrary 
metrics eab and g.b in the Sobolev norm are analogous to an 
arbitrary coordinate system with respect to which averages are 
calculated. In the classical mechanics of fields in a finite box, one 
can define a similar norm 1111 = [J li/11
2 du ]112 on the classical field 
t/1. The sum I7-i llt/1<0 11 with t/1<'> being the ith derivative of t/1, is 
essentially the same as the Sobolev norm. This sum is a map / 
from the space of all values of the field and its first n derivatives 
into R. If the range of/ is bounded-as it must be if the solutions 
t/J are stable-then the evolution of t/1 must result in accumula-
tion points in the range of f. An analogous accumulation is 
impossible in general relativity, as the above theorem shows. In 
general relativity the range of f is not bounded-singularities 
develop in space-time (this follows from the hypotheses of the 
above theorem and theorem 2 of ref. 9, p 266). This sort of 
singular behaviour is typical of many non-linear field 
theories10•11 , but in linear field theories such as electromag-
netism the solutions are stable and are hence bounded. For 
example, the solutions to the Schrodinger equation in a finite 
box must recur12' 13 in the above average sense: for any initial 
value t/l(t0) for the probability distribution and any e, there exists 
a time t for which lli/l(t)-t/J(to)ll<e. 
In a finite universe without singularities there should be a 
finite number of physically distinguishable states (this should 
also be true if the matter in the universe is in the form of fields, 
for reasons stated above). I would expect that the states of such a 
universe would evolve in general in a quasi-ergodic way1'·15 • If 
the evolution of the physically distinguishable states is indeed 
quasi-ergodic, then in infinite time, every state would with high 
probability occur an infinite number of times. 
Another way to model the evolution of such a finite-state 
always-existing universe, is by regarding the evolution as a finite 
discrete Markov chain 16 with stationary transition probabilities. 
That is, we will sample the state of the Universe at definite time 
intervals A.t, and we will assume that the state of the Universe at 
time t; is determined by the previous state at time ti-I and the 
probability matrix of going from this previous state to any other 
state. If the Universe has existed for an infinite time, then with 
probability one the states of the Universe form a closed set (ref. 
16, p 384); that is, we may consider without loss of generality 
that the Markov chain representing the Universe is now irre-
ducible. By theorem 4 of ref. 16 (p 392), it follows that with 
probability one, all states recur in the future. 
Similar arguments will imply some form of recurrence in 
closed universes which avoid singularities by 'bouncing' at some 
small radius (such behaviour could, of course, occur only if some 
of the conditions in the no-return theorem are violated
17). One 
could envisage the physical constants of the Universe, such as 
the elementary particle masses, the coupling constants, the 
specific entropy per baryon, and so forth, changing in some 
fashion at each bounce. These physical constants can be regar-
ded as additional variables in the initial data. If the number of 
such constants is finite and if their range of variation is finite, 
then in a finite universe one would expect a finite number of 
physically distinguishable states. This implies accumulation 
points in the state space with an infinite number of bounces; with 
quasi-ergodic or markovian evolution, we would have recur-
rence of all states with high probability. Quantum-mechanical 

Nature Vol. 280 19 July 1979 
considerations do not substantially alter this conclusion, as long 
as the number of physically distinguishable states is to be finite. 
It is, of course, possible to avoid the recurrence conclusion by 
assuming that the range of variation of the physical constants is 
not bounded, or that the Universe, although closed, increases its 
radius at maximum expansion with each bounce. (Tolman 18, for 
example, argued that the monotone increase of entropy 
required a monotone increase of maximum radius at each 
bounce.) However, if the range of physical constant variation is 
not bounded, then a sequence of cycles would exist such that at 
least one physical constant would diverge in the limit. I would 
regard such a divergence as a singularity 'at infinity'. If the 
maximum radius increases monotonically with time, then with 
an infinite number of bounces in the past, the sequences of 
values of the maximum radius must have a limit point in the past. 
If its limiting value is non-zero, then one must have recurrence in 
the past, though this 'recurrence' may take the form of a gradual 
cessation of change, as in the Eddington-Lemaitre universe 19 • If 
its limiting value is zero, then the singularity has not been really 
removed, it has just been placed at temporal infinity. 
But the singularities in the single-cycle closed universe can 
also be regarded as at temporal infinity. In fact, both Milne20 and 
Misner21 have contended that because physical changes occur 
with diverging rapidity (as measured in proper time) near a 
singularity, the singularity should be regarded as occurring at 
temporal infinity as measured in physical time. Barrow and 
myse!f22 have pointed out that extrinsic time23, which is a 
naturally defined absolute time in closed universes24, has just 
this property of placing the singularities at temporal infinity. In 
the extrinsic time scale, a closed universe has existed and will 
exist forever; the question of what preceded the big bang does 
not arise. 
Because of Poincare recurrence, it is impossible to define a 
monotonically-increasing entropy (or any monotonically-
increasing function) for non-gravitational fields or systems of 
particles in terms of the phase space variables of the fields or 
particles. However, since Poincare recurrence does not hold for 
gravitational fields, it is possible to define functions which 
increase monotonically with time-such functions are called 
Lyapunov functions7 •8-on the phase space of the gravitational 
field. In fact, the extrinsic time, which is proportional to the trace 
of the extrinsic curvature of a leaf of a constant mean curvature 
Cauchy hypersurface foliation of space-time, is just such a 
function, as the extrinsic curvature is essentially the momentum 
of the gravitational field 25 and the extrinsic time increases 
monotonically in closed universes, ranging from -oo at the initial 
singularity to +oo at the final singularity24• In non-singular 
205 
asymptotically fl.at space, a foliation of constant mean curvature 
Cauchy surfaces would have to have extrinsic time constant 
( =O). This supports the conclusion of classical mechanics that 
isolated systems cannot define a time direction. 
Bohr26 together with Prigogine and his coworkers4 '8 have 
suggested on the basis of Poincare recurrence that ther-
modynamic concepts such as temperature and entropy are 
complementary to the phase space variables. In other words, 
they argue that a detailed microscopic description of the 
behaviour of a physical system would preclude the definition of 
thermodynamic variables for that system. If the gravitational 
field (or more precisely, the global structure of space-time) is 
taken into account, we see that it becomes possible in principle 
to define the thermodynamic variables and the phase space 
variables in a closed universe simultaneously; the notion of 
complementarity becomes unnecessary. This leads to specula-
tion about the connection between quantum mechanics and the 
global structure of space-time: perhaps the impossibility of 
giving a detailed deterministic microscopic description of a 
quantum mechanical system is due to neglect of the global 
structure of space-time.

Geochemical problems of the Antarctic dry areas 
A. T. Wilson* 
Chemistry Department and Antarctic Research Unit, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand 
The dry areas of the Antarctic are extreme deserts. Because 
of the cold they are not subjected to rainfall and geo-
chemical separations can take place which would be 
destroyed by flowing water in the more temperate deserts. 
The distribution of soluble salts which accumulate on the 
surf ace and in the lakes is unusual and is explained on the 
basis of relative humidity separation mechanism. It is 
suggested that similar phenomena may take place on Mars.

AL THOUGH much of the Antarctic continent is covered with ice 
and snow, there are some areas which are ice free. These 
so-called 'dry areas' are extreme deserts, characterised by 
extreme cold and aridity. They are also unique among deserts in 
being completely rainless. All precipitation falls as snow which is 
largely lost by sublimation. The salt geochemistry of water 
soluble salts which accumulate on the surface and concentrate in 
the lakes and ponds of these dry areas is described here. A 
relative humidity separation mechanism is proposed that can 
only operate in rainless deserts. 
Although the salt and lake geochemistry of the McMurdo dry 
area has been studied for almost 20 years, the geochemistry of 
this region is far from being understood and there is a lot of
