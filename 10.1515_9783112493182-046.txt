About the Critical Condition of the Ising and Potts Model 
on the Pentagon Lattice 
By 
D.HAJDUKOVld and LJ. MAURER 
Homogeneous Ising models have been studied extensively on various two-di-
mensional lattices, e.g., on triangular, square, and honeycomb lattices /l/ 
as well as on "mixed" lattices (see for instance /2/). Example of the latter is 
the pentagon lattice which is the subject of this note. 
It is known /3, 4/ that the exact critical conditions of the Ising and Potts 
model on triangular, square, and honeycomb lattices (i.e. on "non-mixed" 
lattices) can be obtained by considering only a single triangle, square, or 
hexagon. In the present note we are going to extend this approach to the case 
of the pentagon lattice. Our result can be compared with the exact one obtained 
recently /5/. 
We consider Ising spins S. = +1 on the lattice sites i which interact via

nearest neighbour couplings K = 0J, f> 
= k^T, so that K > 0 corresponds to 
ferromagnetic interactions. The Hamiltonian is given by 
*Hf$H= -K £ S S. ,

where the sum runs over all nearest neighbour pairs of spins. Let us introduce 
a new variable n, the number of terms for which S.S. = 1, into the Hamiltonian

(1) which becomes 
V = -K(2n - N) = -2Kn + KN , 
(2) 
where N is the number of sites in the lattice. 
The partition function is then 
Z =£(Xn)exp(K(2n -N))=£z(n) ,

where G(n) is the number of configurations with a given n, i. e. the degeneracy 
of the state with a fixed energy (2). It is very difficult to obtain G(n), i. e. z(n) 
for the entire lattice. They are, however, easily obtainable for just a single

pentagon. From this point we strictly use the approach presented in a previous 
paper /4/. The assumption is that information about critical temperature of the 
infinite system is retained in the values of z(n) for a single pentagon. The pos-
sible values of n for a single pentagon are n = 1, 3, 5 and 
z(l) = 10 e" 3 K , 
z(3) = 20 e K , 
z(5) = 2 e 5 K . 
(4) 
The same rule as in the cited paper /4/ gives that the critical coupling is the 
solution of the following equation: 
z(5) - z(3) + z(l) = 0 
(5) 
i. e. 
e 8 K - 10 e 4 K +5 = 0 
(6) 
from which we obtain

C = (5 + 2V5)"1/4 = 0.570 . . . . 
The exact result / 5 / is 
(e 
^ 
= 0.577... . 
Thus in the case of a "mixed" lattice our procedure gives only a good ap-
proximation. 
In the case of a q-state Potts model up to now to our best knowledge there 
are no exact solutions nor good approximations. For the special case q = 2 in-
4K 
2K 
stead of (6) we have an approximate critical condition e 
- l O e 
+5 = 0. In 
accordance with previous results /6 to 9/ we make a conjecture for "non-mixed" 
lattices that 
e 4 K - 10 e 2 K + 5 = q - 2 
(7) 
should be a good approximate critical condition for the q-state Potts ferro-
magnet on the pentagon lattice.
